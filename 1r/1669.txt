carl, edward, sagan, s, e, n, say, g, n, november, 9, 1934, december, 20, 1996, was, an, american, astronomer, planetary, scientist, and, science, communicator, his, best, known, scientific, contribution, is, his, research, on, the, possibility, of, extraterrestrial, life, including, experimental, demonstration, of, the, production, of, amino, acids, from, basic, chemicals, by, exposure, to, light, he, assembled, the, first, physical, messages, sent, into, space, the, pioneer, plaque, and, the, voyager, golden, record, which, were, universal, messages, that, could, potentially, be, understood, by, any, extraterrestrial, intelligence, that, might, find, them, he, argued, in, favor, of, the, hypothesis, which, has, since, been, accepted, that, the, high, surface, temperatures, of, venus, are, the, result, of, the, greenhouse, effect, initially, an, assistant, professor, at, harvard, sagan, later, moved, to, cornell, university, where, he, spent, most, of, his, career, he, published, more, than, 600, scientific, papers, and, articles, and, was, author, co, author, or, editor, of, more, than, 20, books, he, wrote, many, popular, science, books, such, as, the, dragons, of, eden, broca, s, brain, pale, blue, dot, and, the, demon, haunted, world, he, also, co, wrote, and, narrated, the, award, winning, 1980, television, series, cosmos, a, personal, voyage, which, became, the, most, widely, watched, series, in, the, history, of, american, public, television, cosmos, has, been, seen, by, at, least, 500, million, people, in, 60, countries, a, book, also, called, cosmos, was, published, to, accompany, the, series, sagan, also, wrote, a, science, fiction, novel, published, in, 1985, called, contact, which, became, the, basis, for, the, 1997, film, contact, his, papers, comprising, 595, 000, items, are, archived, in, the, library, of, congress, sagan, was, a, popular, public, advocate, of, skeptical, scientific, inquiry, and, the, scientific, method, he, pioneered, the, field, of, exobiology, and, promoted, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, intelligent, life, seti, he, spent, most, of, his, career, as, a, professor, of, astronomy, at, cornell, university, where, he, directed, the, laboratory, for, planetary, studies, sagan, and, his, works, received, numerous, awards, and, honors, including, the, nasa, distinguished, public, service, medal, the, national, academy, of, sciences, public, welfare, medal, the, pulitzer, prize, for, general, non, fiction, for, his, book, the, dragons, of, eden, and, for, cosmos, a, personal, voyage, two, emmy, awards, the, peabody, award, and, the, hugo, award, he, married, three, times, and, had, five, children, after, developing, myelodysplasia, sagan, died, of, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 62, on, december, 20, 1996, carl, edward, sagan, was, born, in, the, bensonhurst, neighborhood, of, new, york, city, s, brooklyn, borough, on, november, 9, 1934, his, mother, rachel, molly, gruber, was, a, housewife, from, new, york, city, his, father, samuel, sagan, was, a, ukrainian, born, garment, worker, who, had, emigrated, from, kamianets, podilskyi, then, in, the, russian, empire, sagan, was, named, in, honor, of, his, maternal, grandmother, chaiya, clara, who, had, died, while, giving, birth, to, her, second, child, she, was, in, sagan, s, words, the, mother, she, never, knew, sagan, s, maternal, grandfather, later, married, a, woman, named, rose, who, sagan, s, sister, carol, would, later, say, was, never, accepted, as, rachel, s, mother, because, rachel, knew, she, wasn, t, her, birth, mother, sagan, s, family, lived, in, a, modest, apartment, in, bensonhurst, he, later, described, his, family, as, reform, jews, the, most, liberal, of, judaism, s, four, main, branches, he, and, his, sister, agreed, that, their, father, was, not, especially, religious, but, that, their, mother, definitely, believed, in, god, and, was, active, in, the, temple, and, served, only, kosher, meat, during, the, worst, years, of, the, depression, his, father, worked, as, a, movie, theater, usher, according, to, biographer, keay, davidson, sagan, experienced, a, kind, of, inner, war, as, a, result, of, his, close, relationship, with, both, his, parents, who, were, in, many, ways, opposites, he, traced, his, analytical, inclinations, to, his, mother, who, had, been, extremely, poor, as, a, child, in, new, york, city, during, world, war, i, and, the, 1920s, and, whose, later, intellectual, ambitions, were, sabotaged, by, her, poverty, status, as, a, woman, and, wife, and, jewish, ethnicity, davidson, suggested, she, worshipped, her, only, son, carl, because, he, would, fulfill, her, unfulfilled, dreams, sagan, believed, that, he, had, inherited, his, sense, of, wonder, from, his, father, who, spent, his, free, time, giving, apples, to, the, poor, or, helping, soothe, tensions, between, workers, and, management, within, new, york, city, s, garment, industry, although, awed, by, his, son, s, intellectual, abilities, sagan, s, father, also, took, his, inquisitiveness, in, stride, viewing, it, as, part, of, growing, up, later, during, his, career, sagan, would, draw, on, his, childhood, memories, to, illustrate, scientific, points, as, he, did, in, his, book, shadows, of, forgotten, ancestors, describing, his, parents, influence, on, his, later, thinking, sagan, said, my, parents, were, not, scientists, they, knew, almost, nothing, about, science, but, in, introducing, me, simultaneously, to, skepticism, and, to, wonder, they, taught, me, the, two, uneasily, cohabiting, modes, of, thought, that, are, central, to, the, scientific, method, he, recalled, that, a, defining, moment, in, his, development, came, when, his, parents, took, him, at, age, four, to, the, 1939, new, york, world, s, fair, he, later, described, his, vivid, memories, of, several, exhibits, there, one, titled, america, of, tomorrow, included, a, moving, map, which, as, he, recalled, showed, beautiful, highways, and, cloverleaves, and, little, general, motors, cars, all, carrying, people, to, skyscrapers, buildings, with, lovely, spires, flying, buttresses, and, it, looked, great, another, involved, a, flashlight, shining, on, a, photoelectric, cell, which, created, a, crackling, sound, and, another, showed, how, the, sound, from, a, tuning, fork, became, a, wave, on, an, oscilloscope, he, also, saw, an, exhibit, of, the, then, nascent, medium, known, as, television, remembering, it, he, later, wrote, plainly, the, world, held, wonders, of, a, kind, i, had, never, guessed, how, could, a, tone, become, a, picture, and, light, become, a, noise, sagan, also, saw, one, of, the, fair, s, most, publicized, events, the, burial, at, flushing, meadows, of, a, time, capsule, which, contained, mementos, from, the, 1930s, to, be, recovered, by, earth, s, descendants, in, a, future, millennium, davidson, wrote, that, this, thrilled, carl, as, an, adult, inspired, by, his, memories, of, the, world, s, fair, sagan, and, his, colleagues, would, create, similar, time, capsules, to, be, sent, out, into, the, galaxy, the, pioneer, plaque, and, the, voyager, golden, record, pr, cis, during, world, war, ii, sagan, s, parents, worried, about, the, fate, of, their, european, relatives, but, he, was, generally, unaware, of, the, details, of, the, ongoing, war, he, wrote, sure, we, had, relatives, who, were, caught, up, in, the, holocaust, hitler, was, not, a, popular, fellow, in, our, household, but, on, the, other, hand, i, was, fairly, insulated, from, the, horrors, of, the, war, his, sister, carol, said, that, their, mother, above, all, wanted, to, protect, carl, she, had, an, extraordinarily, difficult, time, dealing, with, world, war, ii, and, the, holocaust, sagan, s, book, the, demon, haunted, world, 1996, included, his, memories, of, this, conflicted, period, when, his, family, dealt, with, the, realities, of, the, war, in, europe, but, tried, to, prevent, it, from, undermining, his, optimistic, spirit, soon, after, entering, elementary, school, sagan, began, to, express, his, strong, inquisitiveness, about, nature, he, recalled, taking, his, first, trips, to, the, public, library, alone, at, age, five, when, his, mother, got, him, a, library, card, he, wanted, to, learn, what, stars, were, since, none, of, his, friends, or, their, parents, could, give, him, a, clear, answer, i, went, to, the, librarian, and, asked, for, a, book, about, stars, and, the, answer, was, stunning, it, was, that, the, sun, was, a, star, but, really, close, the, stars, were, suns, but, so, far, away, they, were, just, little, points, of, light, the, scale, of, the, universe, suddenly, opened, up, to, me, it, was, a, kind, of, religious, experience, there, was, a, magnificence, to, it, a, grandeur, a, scale, which, has, never, left, me, never, ever, left, me, when, he, was, about, six, or, seven, he, and, a, close, friend, took, trips, to, the, american, museum, of, natural, history, in, manhattan, while, there, they, visited, the, hayden, planetarium, and, walked, around, exhibits, of, space, objects, such, as, meteorites, as, well, as, displays, of, dinosaur, skeletons, and, naturalistic, scenes, with, animals, as, sagan, later, wrote, i, was, transfixed, by, the, dioramas, lifelike, representations, of, animals, and, their, habitats, all, over, the, world, penguins, on, the, dimly, lit, antarctic, ice, a, family, of, gorillas, the, male, beating, his, chest, an, american, grizzly, bear, standing, on, his, hind, legs, ten, or, twelve, feet, tall, and, staring, me, right, in, the, eye, sagan, s, parents, nurtured, his, growing, interest, in, science, buying, him, chemistry, sets, and, reading, matter, but, his, fascination, with, outer, space, emerged, as, his, primary, focus, especially, after, he, had, read, science, fiction, by, such, writers, as, h, g, wells, and, edgar, rice, burroughs, stirring, his, curiosity, about, the, possibility, of, life, on, mars, and, other, planets, according, to, biographer, ray, spangenburg, sagan, s, efforts, in, his, early, years, to, understand, the, mysteries, of, the, planets, became, a, driving, force, in, his, life, a, continual, spark, to, his, intellect, and, a, quest, that, would, never, be, forgotten, in, 1947, sagan, discovered, the, magazine, astounding, science, fiction, which, introduced, him, to, more, hard, science, fiction, speculations, than, those, in, the, burroughs, novels, that, same, year, mass, hysteria, developed, about, the, possibility, that, extraterrestrial, visitors, had, arrived, in, flying, saucers, and, the, young, sagan, joined, in, the, speculation, that, the, flying, discs, people, reported, seeing, in, the, sky, might, be, alien, spaceships, sagan, attended, david, a, boody, junior, high, school, in, his, native, bensonhurst, and, had, his, bar, mitzvah, when, he, turned, 13, in, 1948, when, he, was, 14, his, father, s, work, took, the, family, to, the, older, semi, industrial, town, of, rahway, new, jersey, where, he, attended, rahway, high, school, he, was, a, straight, a, student, but, was, bored, because, his, classes, did, not, challenge, him, and, his, teachers, did, not, inspire, him, his, teachers, realized, this, and, tried, to, convince, his, parents, to, send, him, to, a, private, school, with, an, administrator, telling, them, this, kid, ought, to, go, to, a, school, for, gifted, children, he, has, something, really, remarkable, however, his, parents, could, not, afford, to, do, so, sagan, became, president, of, the, school, s, chemistry, club, and, set, up, his, own, laboratory, at, home, he, taught, himself, about, molecules, by, making, cardboard, cutouts, to, help, him, visualize, how, they, were, formed, i, found, that, about, as, interesting, as, doing, experiments, he, was, mostly, interested, in, astronomy, learning, about, it, in, his, spare, time, in, his, junior, year, of, high, school, he, discovered, that, professional, astronomers, were, paid, for, doing, something, he, always, enjoyed, and, decided, on, astronomy, as, a, career, goal, that, was, a, splendid, day, when, i, began, to, suspect, that, if, i, tried, hard, i, could, do, astronomy, full, time, not, just, part, time, sagan, graduated, from, rahway, high, school, in, 1951, before, the, end, of, high, school, sagan, entered, an, essay, writing, contest, in, which, he, explored, the, idea, that, human, contact, with, advanced, life, forms, from, another, planet, might, be, as, disastrous, for, people, on, earth, as, native, americans, first, contact, with, europeans, had, been, for, native, americans, the, subject, was, considered, controversial, but, his, rhetorical, skill, won, over, the, judges, and, they, awarded, him, first, prize, when, he, was, about, to, graduate, from, high, school, his, classmates, voted, him, most, likely, to, succeed, and, put, him, in, line, to, be, valedictorian, he, attended, the, university, of, chicago, because, despite, his, excellent, high, school, grades, it, was, one, of, the, very, few, colleges, he, had, applied, to, that, would, consider, accepting, a, 16, year, old, its, chancellor, robert, maynard, hutchins, had, recently, retooled, the, undergraduate, college, of, the, university, of, chicago, into, an, ideal, meritocracy, built, on, great, books, socratic, dialogue, comprehensive, examinations, and, early, entrance, to, college, with, no, age, requirement, as, an, honors, program, undergraduate, sagan, worked, in, the, laboratory, of, geneticist, h, j, muller, and, wrote, a, thesis, on, the, origins, of, life, with, physical, chemist, harold, urey, he, also, joined, the, ryerson, astronomical, society, in, 1954, he, was, awarded, a, bachelor, of, arts, with, general, and, special, honors, in, what, he, quipped, was, nothing, in, 1955, he, earned, a, bachelor, of, science, in, physics, he, went, on, to, do, graduate, work, at, the, university, of, chicago, earning, a, master, of, science, in, physics, in, 1956, and, a, doctor, of, philosophy, in, astronomy, and, astrophysics, in, 1960, his, doctoral, thesis, submitted, to, the, department, of, astronomy, and, astrophysics, was, entitled, physical, studies, of, the, planets, during, his, graduate, studies, he, used, the, summer, months, to, work, with, planetary, scientist, gerard, kuiper, who, was, his, dissertation, director, as, well, as, physicist, george, gamow, and, chemist, melvin, calvin, the, title, of, sagan, s, dissertation, reflected, interests, he, had, in, common, with, kuiper, who, had, been, president, of, the, international, astronomical, union, s, commission, on, physical, studies, of, planets, and, satellites, throughout, the, 1950s, in, 1958, sagan, and, kuiper, worked, on, the, classified, military, project, a119, a, secret, u, s, air, force, plan, to, detonate, a, nuclear, warhead, on, the, moon, and, document, its, effects, sagan, had, a, top, secret, clearance, at, the, air, force, and, a, secret, clearance, with, nasa, in, 1999, an, article, published, in, the, journal, nature, revealed, that, sagan, had, included, the, classified, titles, of, two, project, a119, papers, in, his, 1959, application, for, a, scholarship, to, university, of, california, berkeley, a, follow, up, letter, to, the, journal, by, project, leader, leonard, reiffel, confirmed, sagan, s, security, leak, from, 1960, to, 1962, sagan, was, a, miller, fellow, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, meanwhile, he, published, an, article, in, 1961, in, the, journal, science, on, the, atmosphere, of, venus, while, also, working, with, nasa, s, mariner, 2, team, and, served, as, a, planetary, sciences, consultant, to, the, rand, corporation, after, the, publication, of, sagan, s, science, article, in, 1961, harvard, university, astronomers, fred, whipple, and, donald, menzel, offered, sagan, the, opportunity, to, give, a, colloquium, at, harvard, and, subsequently, offered, him, a, lecturer, position, at, the, institution, sagan, instead, asked, to, be, made, an, assistant, professor, and, eventually, whipple, and, menzel, were, able, to, convince, harvard, to, offer, sagan, the, assistant, professor, position, he, requested, sagan, lectured, performed, research, and, advised, graduate, students, at, the, institution, from, 1963, until, 1968, as, well, as, working, at, the, smithsonian, astrophysical, observatory, also, located, in, cambridge, massachusetts, in, 1968, sagan, was, denied, academic, tenure, at, harvard, he, later, indicated, that, the, decision, was, very, unexpected, the, denial, has, been, blamed, on, several, factors, including, that, he, focused, his, interests, too, broadly, across, a, number, of, areas, while, the, norm, in, academia, is, to, become, a, renowned, expert, in, a, narrow, specialty, and, perhaps, because, of, his, well, publicized, scientific, advocacy, which, some, scientists, perceived, as, borrowing, the, ideas, of, others, for, little, more, than, self, promotion, an, advisor, from, his, years, as, an, undergraduate, student, harold, urey, wrote, a, letter, to, the, tenure, committee, recommending, strongly, against, tenure, for, sagan, science, is, more, than, a, body, of, knowledge, it, is, a, way, of, thinking, i, have, a, foreboding, of, an, america, in, my, children, s, or, grandchildren, s, time, when, the, united, states, is, a, service, and, information, economy, when, nearly, all, the, key, manufacturing, industries, have, slipped, away, to, other, countries, when, awesome, technological, powers, are, in, the, hands, of, a, very, few, and, no, one, representing, the, public, interest, can, even, grasp, the, issues, when, the, people, have, lost, the, ability, to, set, their, own, agendas, or, knowledgeably, question, those, in, authority, when, clutching, our, crystals, and, nervously, consulting, our, horoscopes, our, critical, faculties, in, decline, unable, to, distinguish, between, what, feels, good, and, what, s, true, we, slide, almost, without, noticing, back, into, superstition, and, darkness, the, dumbing, down, of, america, is, most, evident, in, the, slow, decay, of, substantive, content, in, the, enormously, influential, media, the, 30, second, sound, bites, now, down, to, 10, seconds, or, less, lowest, common, denominator, programming, credulous, presentations, on, pseudoscience, and, superstition, but, especially, a, kind, of, celebration, of, ignorance, carl, sagan, from, demon, haunted, world, 1995, long, before, the, ill, fated, tenure, process, cornell, university, astronomer, thomas, gold, had, courted, sagan, to, move, to, ithaca, new, york, and, join, the, recently, hired, astronomer, frank, drake, among, the, faculty, at, cornell, following, the, denial, of, tenure, from, harvard, sagan, accepted, gold, s, offer, and, remained, a, faculty, member, at, cornell, for, nearly, 30, years, until, his, death, in, 1996, unlike, harvard, the, smaller, and, more, laid, back, astronomy, department, at, cornell, welcomed, sagan, s, growing, celebrity, status, following, two, years, as, an, associate, professor, sagan, became, a, full, professor, at, cornell, in, 1970, and, directed, the, laboratory, for, planetary, studies, there, from, 1972, to, 1981, he, was, associate, director, of, the, center, for, radiophysics, and, space, research, crsr, at, cornell, in, 1976, he, became, the, david, duncan, professor, of, astronomy, and, space, sciences, a, position, he, held, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, sagan, was, associated, with, the, u, s, space, program, from, its, inception, from, the, 1950s, onward, he, worked, as, an, advisor, to, nasa, where, one, of, his, duties, included, briefing, the, apollo, astronauts, before, their, flights, to, the, moon, sagan, contributed, to, many, of, the, robotic, spacecraft, missions, that, explored, the, solar, system, arranging, experiments, on, many, of, the, expeditions, sagan, assembled, the, first, physical, message, that, was, sent, into, space, a, gold, plated, plaque, attached, to, the, space, probe, pioneer, 10, launched, in, 1972, pioneer, 11, also, carrying, another, copy, of, the, plaque, was, launched, the, following, year, he, continued, to, refine, his, designs, the, most, elaborate, message, he, helped, to, develop, and, assemble, was, the, voyager, golden, record, which, was, sent, out, with, the, voyager, space, probes, in, 1977, sagan, often, challenged, the, decisions, to, fund, the, space, shuttle, and, the, international, space, station, at, the, expense, of, further, robotic, missions, former, student, david, morrison, described, sagan, as, an, idea, person, and, a, master, of, intuitive, physical, arguments, and, back, of, the, envelope, calculations, and, gerard, kuiper, said, that, some, persons, work, best, in, specializing, on, a, major, program, in, the, laboratory, others, are, best, in, liaison, between, sciences, dr, sagan, belongs, in, the, latter, group, sagan, s, contributions, were, central, to, the, discovery, of, the, high, surface, temperatures, of, the, planet, venus, in, the, early, 1960s, no, one, knew, for, certain, the, basic, conditions, of, venus, surface, and, sagan, listed, the, possibilities, in, a, report, later, depicted, for, popularization, in, a, time, life, book, planets, his, own, view, was, that, venus, was, dry, and, very, hot, as, opposed, to, the, balmy, paradise, others, had, imagined, he, had, investigated, radio, waves, from, venus, and, concluded, that, there, was, a, surface, temperature, of, 500, c, 900, f, as, a, visiting, scientist, to, nasa, s, jet, propulsion, laboratory, he, contributed, to, the, first, mariner, missions, to, venus, working, on, the, design, and, management, of, the, project, mariner, 2, confirmed, his, conclusions, on, the, surface, conditions, of, venus, in, 1962, sagan, was, among, the, first, to, hypothesize, that, saturn, s, moon, titan, might, possess, oceans, of, liquid, compounds, on, its, surface, and, that, jupiter, s, moon, europa, might, possess, subsurface, oceans, of, water, this, would, make, europa, potentially, habitable, europa, s, subsurface, ocean, of, water, was, later, indirectly, confirmed, by, the, spacecraft, galileo, the, mystery, of, titan, s, reddish, haze, was, also, solved, with, sagan, s, help, the, reddish, haze, was, revealed, to, be, due, to, complex, organic, molecules, constantly, raining, down, onto, titan, s, surface, sagan, further, contributed, insights, regarding, the, atmospheres, of, venus, and, jupiter, as, well, as, seasonal, changes, on, mars, he, also, perceived, global, warming, as, a, growing, man, made, danger, and, likened, it, to, the, natural, development, of, venus, into, a, hot, life, hostile, planet, through, a, kind, of, runaway, greenhouse, effect, he, testified, to, the, us, congress, in, 1985, that, the, greenhouse, effect, would, change, the, earth, s, climate, system, sagan, and, his, cornell, colleague, edwin, ernest, salpeter, speculated, about, life, in, jupiter, s, clouds, given, the, planet, s, dense, atmospheric, composition, rich, in, organic, molecules, he, studied, the, observed, color, variations, on, mars, surface, and, concluded, that, they, were, not, seasonal, or, vegetational, changes, as, most, believed, but, shifts, in, surface, dust, caused, by, windstorms, sagan, is, also, known, for, his, research, on, the, possibilities, of, extraterrestrial, life, including, experimental, demonstration, of, the, production, of, amino, acids, from, basic, chemicals, by, radiation, he, is, also, the, 1994, recipient, of, the, public, welfare, medal, the, highest, award, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, for, distinguished, contributions, in, the, application, of, science, to, the, public, welfare, he, was, denied, membership, in, the, academy, reportedly, because, his, media, activities, made, him, unpopular, with, many, other, scientists, as, of, 2017, sagan, is, the, most, cited, seti, scientist, and, one, of, the, most, cited, planetary, scientists, in, 1980, sagan, co, wrote, and, narrated, the, award, winning, 13, part, pbs, television, series, cosmos, a, personal, voyage, which, became, the, most, widely, watched, series, in, the, history, of, american, public, television, until, 1990, the, show, has, been, seen, by, at, least, 500, million, people, across, 60, countries, the, book, cosmos, written, by, sagan, was, published, to, accompany, the, series, because, of, his, earlier, popularity, as, a, science, writer, from, his, best, selling, books, including, the, dragons, of, eden, which, won, him, a, pulitzer, prize, in, 1977, he, was, asked, to, write, and, narrate, the, show, it, was, targeted, to, a, general, audience, of, viewers, whom, sagan, felt, had, lost, interest, in, science, partly, due, to, a, stifled, educational, system, each, of, the, 13, episodes, was, created, to, focus, on, a, particular, subject, or, person, thereby, demonstrating, the, synergy, of, the, universe, they, covered, a, wide, range, of, scientific, subjects, including, the, origin, of, life, and, a, perspective, of, humans, place, on, earth, the, show, won, an, emmy, along, with, a, peabody, award, and, transformed, sagan, from, an, obscure, astronomer, into, a, pop, culture, icon, time, magazine, ran, a, cover, story, about, sagan, soon, after, the, show, broadcast, referring, to, him, as, creator, chief, writer, and, host, narrator, of, the, show, in, 2000, cosmos, was, released, on, a, remastered, set, of, dvds, after, cosmos, aired, sagan, became, associated, with, the, catchphrase, billions, and, billions, although, he, never, actually, used, the, phrase, in, the, cosmos, series, he, rather, used, the, term, billions, upon, billions, richard, feynman, a, precursor, to, sagan, used, the, phrase, billions, and, billions, many, times, in, his, red, books, however, sagan, s, frequent, use, of, the, word, billions, and, distinctive, delivery, emphasizing, the, b, which, he, did, intentionally, in, place, of, more, cumbersome, alternatives, such, as, billions, with, a, b, in, order, to, distinguish, the, word, from, millions, made, him, a, favorite, target, of, comic, performers, including, johnny, carson, gary, kroeger, mike, myers, bronson, pinchot, penn, jillette, harry, shearer, and, others, frank, zappa, satirized, the, line, in, the, song, be, in, my, video, noting, as, well, atomic, light, sagan, took, this, all, in, good, humor, and, his, final, book, was, titled, billions, and, billions, which, opened, with, a, tongue, in, cheek, discussion, of, this, catchphrase, observing, that, carson, was, an, amateur, astronomer, and, that, carson, s, comic, caricature, often, included, real, science, as, a, humorous, tribute, to, sagan, and, his, association, with, the, catchphrase, billions, and, billions, a, sagan, has, been, defined, as, a, unit, of, measurement, equivalent, to, a, very, large, number, of, anything, sagan, s, number, is, the, number, of, stars, in, the, observable, universe, this, number, is, reasonably, well, defined, because, it, is, known, what, stars, are, and, what, the, observable, universe, is, but, its, value, is, highly, uncertain, sagan, s, ability, to, convey, his, ideas, allowed, many, people, to, understand, the, cosmos, better, simultaneously, emphasizing, the, value, and, worthiness, of, the, human, race, and, the, relative, insignificance, of, the, earth, in, comparison, to, the, universe, he, delivered, the, 1977, series, of, royal, institution, christmas, lectures, in, london, sagan, was, a, proponent, of, the, search, for, extraterrestrial, life, he, urged, the, scientific, community, to, listen, with, radio, telescopes, for, signals, from, potential, intelligent, extraterrestrial, life, forms, sagan, was, so, persuasive, that, by, 1982, he, was, able, to, get, a, petition, advocating, seti, published, in, the, journal, science, signed, by, 70, scientists, including, seven, nobel, prize, winners, this, signaled, a, tremendous, increase, in, the, respectability, of, a, then, controversial, field, sagan, also, helped, frank, drake, write, the, arecibo, message, a, radio, message, beamed, into, space, from, the, arecibo, radio, telescope, on, november, 16, 1974, aimed, at, informing, potential, extraterrestrials, about, earth, sagan, was, chief, technology, officer, of, the, professional, planetary, research, journal, icarus, for, 12, years, he, co, founded, the, planetary, society, and, was, a, member, of, the, seti, institute, board, of, trustees, sagan, served, as, chairman, of, the, division, for, planetary, science, of, the, american, astronomical, society, as, president, of, the, planetology, section, of, the, american, geophysical, union, and, as, chairman, of, the, astronomy, section, of, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, aaas, at, the, height, of, the, cold, war, sagan, became, involved, in, nuclear, disarmament, efforts, by, promoting, hypotheses, on, the, effects, of, nuclear, war, when, paul, crutzen, s, twilight, at, noon, concept, suggested, that, a, substantial, nuclear, exchange, could, trigger, a, nuclear, twilight, and, upset, the, delicate, balance, of, life, on, earth, by, cooling, the, surface, in, 1983, he, was, one, of, five, authors, the, s, in, the, follow, up, ttaps, model, as, the, research, article, came, to, be, known, which, contained, the, first, use, of, the, term, nuclear, winter, which, his, colleague, richard, p, turco, had, coined, in, 1984, he, co, authored, the, book, the, cold, and, the, dark, the, world, after, nuclear, war, and, in, 1990, the, book, a, path, where, no, man, thought, nuclear, winter, and, the, end, of, the, arms, race, which, explains, the, nuclear, winter, hypothesis, and, advocates, nuclear, disarmament, sagan, received, a, great, deal, of, skepticism, and, disdain, for, the, use, of, media, to, disseminate, a, very, uncertain, hypothesis, a, personal, correspondence, with, nuclear, physicist, edward, teller, around, 1983, began, amicably, with, teller, expressing, support, for, continued, research, to, ascertain, the, credibility, of, the, winter, hypothesis, however, sagan, and, teller, s, correspondence, would, ultimately, result, in, teller, writing, a, propagandist, is, one, who, uses, incomplete, information, to, produce, maximum, persuasion, i, can, compliment, you, on, being, indeed, an, excellent, propagandist, remembering, that, a, propagandist, is, the, better, the, less, he, appears, to, be, one, biographers, of, sagan, would, also, comment, that, from, a, scientific, viewpoint, nuclear, winter, was, a, low, point, for, sagan, although, politically, speaking, it, popularized, his, image, among, the, public, the, adult, sagan, remained, a, fan, of, science, fiction, although, disliking, stories, that, were, not, realistic, such, as, ignoring, the, inverse, square, law, or, he, said, did, not, include, thoughtful, pursuit, of, alternative, futures, he, wrote, books, to, popularize, science, such, as, cosmos, which, reflected, and, expanded, upon, some, of, the, themes, of, a, personal, voyage, and, became, the, best, selling, science, book, ever, published, in, english, the, dragons, of, eden, speculations, on, the, evolution, of, human, intelligence, which, won, a, pulitzer, prize, and, broca, s, brain, reflections, on, the, romance, of, science, sagan, also, wrote, the, best, selling, science, fiction, novel, contact, in, 1985, based, on, a, film, treatment, he, wrote, with, his, wife, ann, druyan, in, 1979, but, he, did, not, live, to, see, the, book, s, 1997, motion, picture, adaptation, which, starred, jodie, foster, and, won, the, 1998, hugo, award, for, best, dramatic, presentation, on, it, everyone, you, ever, heard, of, the, aggregate, of, all, our, joys, and, sufferings, thousands, of, confident, religions, ideologies, and, economic, doctrines, every, hunter, and, forager, every, hero, and, coward, every, creator, and, destroyer, of, civilizations, every, king, and, peasant, every, young, couple, in, love, every, hopeful, child, every, mother, and, father, every, inventor, and, explorer, every, teacher, of, morals, every, corrupt, politician, every, superstar, every, supreme, leader, every, saint, and, sinner, in, the, history, of, our, species, lived, there, on, a, mote, of, dust, suspended, in, a, sunbeam, think, of, the, rivers, of, blood, spilled, by, all, those, generals, and, emperors, so, that, in, glory, and, triumph, they, could, become, the, momentary, masters, of, a, fraction, of, a, dot, carl, sagan, cornell, lecture, in, 1994, sagan, wrote, a, sequel, to, cosmos, pale, blue, dot, a, vision, of, the, human, future, in, space, which, was, selected, as, a, notable, book, of, 1995, by, the, new, york, times, he, appeared, on, pbs, s, charlie, rose, program, in, january, 1995, sagan, also, wrote, the, introduction, for, stephen, hawking, s, bestseller, a, brief, history, of, time, sagan, was, also, known, for, his, popularization, of, science, his, efforts, to, increase, scientific, understanding, among, the, general, public, and, his, positions, in, favor, of, scientific, skepticism, and, against, pseudoscience, such, as, his, debunking, of, the, betty, and, barney, hill, abduction, to, mark, the, tenth, anniversary, of, sagan, s, death, david, morrison, a, former, student, of, sagan, recalled, sagan, s, immense, contributions, to, planetary, research, the, public, understanding, of, science, and, the, skeptical, movement, in, skeptical, inquirer, following, saddam, hussein, s, threats, to, light, kuwait, s, oil, wells, on, fire, in, response, to, any, physical, challenge, to, iraqi, control, of, the, oil, assets, sagan, together, with, his, ttaps, colleagues, and, paul, crutzen, warned, in, january, 1991, in, the, baltimore, sun, and, wilmington, morning, star, newspapers, that, if, the, fires, were, left, to, burn, over, a, period, of, several, months, enough, smoke, from, the, 600, or, so, 1991, kuwaiti, oil, fires, might, get, so, high, as, to, disrupt, agriculture, in, much, of, south, asia, and, that, this, possibility, should, affect, the, war, plans, these, claims, were, also, the, subject, of, a, televised, debate, between, sagan, and, physicist, fred, singer, on, january, 22, aired, on, the, abc, news, program, nightline, in, the, televised, debate, sagan, argued, that, the, effects, of, the, smoke, would, be, similar, to, the, effects, of, a, nuclear, winter, with, singer, arguing, to, the, contrary, after, the, debate, the, fires, burnt, for, many, months, before, extinguishing, efforts, were, complete, the, results, of, the, smoke, did, not, produce, continental, sized, cooling, sagan, later, conceded, in, the, demon, haunted, world, that, the, prediction, did, not, turn, out, to, be, correct, it, was, pitch, black, at, noon, and, temperatures, dropped, 4, 6, c, over, the, persian, gulf, but, not, much, smoke, reached, stratospheric, altitudes, and, asia, was, spared, in, his, later, years, sagan, advocated, the, creation, of, an, organized, search, for, asteroids, near, earth, objects, neos, that, might, impact, the, earth, but, to, forestall, or, postpone, developing, the, technological, methods, that, would, be, needed, to, defend, against, them, he, argued, that, all, of, the, numerous, methods, proposed, to, alter, the, orbit, of, an, asteroid, including, the, employment, of, nuclear, detonations, created, a, deflection, dilemma, if, the, ability, to, deflect, an, asteroid, away, from, the, earth, exists, then, one, would, also, have, the, ability, to, divert, a, non, threatening, object, towards, earth, creating, an, immensely, destructive, weapon, in, a, 1994, paper, he, co, authored, he, ridiculed, a, three, day, long, near, earth, object, interception, workshop, held, by, los, alamos, national, laboratory, lanl, in, 1993, that, did, not, even, in, passing, state, that, such, interception, and, deflection, technologies, could, have, these, ancillary, dangers, sagan, remained, hopeful, that, the, natural, neo, impact, threat, and, the, intrinsically, double, edged, essence, of, the, methods, to, prevent, these, threats, would, serve, as, a, new, and, potent, motivation, to, maturing, international, relations, later, acknowledging, that, with, sufficient, international, oversight, in, the, future, a, work, our, way, up, approach, to, implementing, nuclear, explosive, deflection, methods, could, be, fielded, and, when, sufficient, knowledge, was, gained, to, use, them, to, aid, in, mining, asteroids, his, interest, in, the, use, of, nuclear, detonations, in, space, grew, out, of, his, work, in, 1958, for, the, armour, research, foundation, s, project, a119, concerning, the, possibility, of, detonating, a, nuclear, device, on, the, lunar, surface, sagan, was, a, critic, of, plato, having, said, of, the, ancient, greek, philosopher, science, and, mathematics, were, to, be, removed, from, the, hands, of, the, merchants, and, the, artisans, this, tendency, found, its, most, effective, advocate, in, a, follower, of, pythagoras, named, plato, and, he, plato, believed, that, ideas, were, far, more, real, than, the, natural, world, he, advised, the, astronomers, not, to, waste, their, time, observing, the, stars, and, planets, it, was, better, he, believed, just, to, think, about, them, plato, expressed, hostility, to, observation, and, experiment, he, taught, contempt, for, the, real, world, and, disdain, for, the, practical, application, of, scientific, knowledge, plato, s, followers, succeeded, in, extinguishing, the, light, of, science, and, experiment, that, had, been, kindled, by, democritus, and, the, other, ionians, in, 1995, as, part, of, his, book, the, demon, haunted, world, sagan, popularized, a, set, of, tools, for, skeptical, thinking, called, the, baloney, detection, kit, a, phrase, first, coined, by, arthur, felberbaum, a, friend, of, his, wife, ann, druyan, speaking, about, his, activities, in, popularizing, science, sagan, said, that, there, were, at, least, two, reasons, for, scientists, to, share, the, purposes, of, science, and, its, contemporary, state, simple, self, interest, was, one, much, of, the, funding, for, science, came, from, the, public, and, the, public, therefore, had, the, right, to, know, how, the, money, was, being, spent, if, scientists, increased, public, admiration, for, science, there, was, a, good, chance, of, having, more, public, supporters, the, other, reason, was, the, excitement, of, communicating, one, s, own, excitement, about, science, to, others, following, the, success, of, cosmos, sagan, set, up, his, own, publishing, firm, cosmos, store, to, publish, science, books, for, the, general, public, it, was, not, successful, while, sagan, was, widely, adored, by, the, general, public, his, reputation, in, the, scientific, community, was, more, polarized, critics, sometimes, characterized, his, work, as, fanciful, non, rigorous, and, self, aggrandizing, and, others, complained, in, his, later, years, that, he, neglected, his, role, as, a, faculty, member, to, foster, his, celebrity, status, one, of, sagan, s, harshest, critics, harold, urey, felt, that, sagan, was, getting, too, much, publicity, for, a, scientist, and, was, treating, some, scientific, theories, too, casually, urey, and, sagan, were, said, to, have, different, philosophies, of, science, according, to, davidson, while, urey, was, an, old, time, empiricist, who, avoided, theorizing, about, the, unknown, sagan, was, by, contrast, willing, to, speculate, openly, about, such, matters, fred, whipple, wanted, harvard, to, keep, sagan, there, but, learned, that, because, urey, was, a, nobel, laureate, his, opinion, was, an, important, factor, in, harvard, denying, sagan, tenure, sagan, s, harvard, friend, lester, grinspoon, also, stated, i, know, harvard, well, enough, to, know, there, are, people, there, who, certainly, do, not, like, people, who, are, outspoken, grinspoon, added, wherever, you, turned, there, was, one, astronomer, being, quoted, on, everything, one, astronomer, whose, face, you, were, seeing, on, tv, and, one, astronomer, whose, books, had, the, preferred, display, slot, at, the, local, bookstore, some, like, urey, later, believed, that, sagan, s, popular, brand, of, scientific, advocacy, was, beneficial, to, the, science, as, a, whole, urey, especially, liked, sagan, s, 1977, book, the, dragons, of, eden, and, wrote, sagan, with, his, opinion, i, like, it, very, much, and, am, amazed, that, someone, like, you, has, such, an, intimate, knowledge, of, the, various, features, of, the, problem, i, congratulate, you, you, are, a, man, of, many, talents, sagan, was, accused, of, borrowing, some, ideas, of, others, for, his, own, benefit, and, countered, these, claims, by, explaining, that, the, misappropriation, was, an, unfortunate, side, effect, of, his, role, as, a, science, communicator, and, explainer, and, that, he, attempted, to, give, proper, credit, whenever, possible, sagan, believed, that, the, drake, equation, on, substitution, of, reasonable, estimates, suggested, that, a, large, number, of, extraterrestrial, civilizations, would, form, but, that, the, lack, of, evidence, of, such, civilizations, highlighted, by, the, fermi, paradox, suggests, technological, civilizations, tend, to, self, destruct, this, stimulated, his, interest, in, identifying, and, publicizing, ways, that, humanity, could, destroy, itself, with, the, hope, of, avoiding, such, a, cataclysm, and, eventually, becoming, a, spacefaring, species, sagan, s, deep, concern, regarding, the, potential, destruction, of, human, civilization, in, a, nuclear, holocaust, was, conveyed, in, a, memorable, cinematic, sequence, in, the, final, episode, of, cosmos, called, who, speaks, for, earth, sagan, had, already, resigned, from, the, air, force, scientific, advisory, board, s, ufo, investigating, condon, committee, and, voluntarily, surrendered, his, top, secret, clearance, in, protest, over, the, vietnam, war, following, his, marriage, to, his, third, wife, novelist, ann, druyan, in, june, 1981, sagan, became, more, politically, active, particularly, in, opposing, escalation, of, the, nuclear, arms, race, under, president, ronald, reagan, in, march, 1983, reagan, announced, the, strategic, defense, initiative, a, multibillion, dollar, project, to, develop, a, comprehensive, defense, against, attack, by, nuclear, missiles, which, was, quickly, dubbed, the, star, wars, program, sagan, spoke, out, against, the, project, arguing, that, it, was, technically, impossible, to, develop, a, system, with, the, level, of, perfection, required, and, far, more, expensive, to, build, such, a, system, than, it, would, be, for, an, enemy, to, defeat, it, through, decoys, and, other, means, and, that, its, construction, would, seriously, destabilize, the, nuclear, balance, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, making, further, progress, toward, nuclear, disarmament, impossible, when, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, declared, a, unilateral, moratorium, on, the, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, which, would, begin, on, august, 6, 1985, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, atomic, bombing, of, hiroshima, the, reagan, administration, dismissed, the, dramatic, move, as, nothing, more, than, propaganda, and, refused, to, follow, suit, in, response, us, anti, nuclear, and, peace, activists, staged, a, series, of, protest, actions, at, the, nevada, test, site, beginning, on, easter, sunday, in, 1986, and, continuing, through, 1987, hundreds, of, people, in, the, nevada, desert, experience, group, were, arrested, including, sagan, who, was, arrested, on, two, separate, occasions, as, he, climbed, over, a, chain, link, fence, at, the, test, site, during, the, underground, operation, charioteer, and, united, states, s, musketeer, nuclear, test, series, of, detonations, sagan, was, also, a, vocal, advocate, of, the, controversial, notion, of, testosterone, poisoning, arguing, in, 1992, that, human, males, could, become, gripped, by, an, unusually, severe, testosterone, poisoning, and, this, could, compel, them, to, become, genocidal, in, his, review, of, moondance, magazine, writer, daniela, gioseffi, s, 1990, book, women, on, war, he, argues, that, females, are, the, only, half, of, humanity, untainted, by, testosterone, poisoning, one, chapter, of, his, 1993, book, shadows, of, forgotten, ancestors, is, dedicated, to, testosterone, and, its, alleged, poisonous, effects, in, 1989, carl, sagan, was, interviewed, by, ted, turner, whether, he, believed, in, socialism, and, responded, that, i, m, not, sure, what, a, socialist, is, but, i, believe, the, government, has, a, responsibility, to, care, for, the, people, i, m, talking, about, making, the, people, self, reliant, sagan, was, married, three, times, in, 1957, he, married, biologist, lynn, margulis, the, couple, had, two, children, jeremy, and, dorion, sagan, their, marriage, ended, in, 1964, sagan, married, artist, linda, salzman, in, 1968, and, they, had, a, child, together, nick, sagan, and, divorced, in, 1981, during, these, marriages, carl, sagan, focused, heavily, on, his, career, a, factor, which, may, have, contributed, to, sagan, s, first, divorce, in, 1981, sagan, married, author, ann, druyan, and, they, later, had, two, children, alexandra, known, as, sasha, and, samuel, sagan, carl, sagan, and, druyan, remained, married, until, his, death, in, 1996, while, teaching, at, cornell, he, lived, in, an, egyptian, revival, house, in, ithaca, perched, on, the, edge, of, a, cliff, that, had, formerly, been, the, headquarters, of, a, cornell, university, secret, society, while, there, he, drove, a, red, porsche, 911, targa, and, an, orange, 1970, porsche, 914, with, the, license, plate, phobos, in, 1994, engineers, at, apple, computer, code, named, the, power, macintosh, 7100, carl, sagan, in, the, hope, that, apple, would, make, billions, and, billions, with, the, sale, of, the, powermac, 7100, the, name, was, only, used, internally, but, sagan, was, concerned, that, it, would, become, a, product, endorsement, and, sent, apple, a, cease, and, desist, letter, apple, complied, but, engineers, retaliated, by, changing, the, internal, codename, to, bha, for, butt, head, astronomer, in, november, 1995, after, further, legal, battle, an, out, of, court, settlement, was, reached, and, apple, s, office, of, trademarks, and, patents, released, a, conciliatory, statement, that, apple, has, always, had, great, respect, for, dr, sagan, it, was, never, apple, s, intention, to, cause, dr, sagan, or, his, family, any, embarrassment, or, concern, in, 2019, carl, sagan, s, daughter, sasha, sagan, released, for, small, creatures, such, as, we, rituals, for, finding, meaning, in, our, unlikely, world, which, depicts, life, with, her, parents, and, her, father, s, death, when, she, was, fourteen, building, on, a, theme, in, her, father, s, work, sasha, sagan, argues, in, for, small, creatures, such, as, we, that, skepticism, does, not, imply, pessimism, i, have, just, finished, the, cosmic, connection, and, loved, every, word, of, it, you, are, my, idea, of, a, good, writer, because, you, have, an, unmannered, style, and, when, i, read, what, you, write, i, hear, you, talking, one, thing, about, the, book, made, me, nervous, it, was, entirely, too, obvious, that, you, are, smarter, than, i, am, i, hate, that, isaac, asimov, in, a, letter, to, sagan, 1973, sagan, was, acquainted, with, science, fiction, fandom, through, his, friendship, with, isaac, asimov, and, he, spoke, at, the, nebula, awards, ceremony, in, 1969, asimov, described, sagan, as, one, of, only, two, people, he, ever, met, whose, intellect, surpassed, his, own, the, other, being, computer, scientist, and, artificial, intelligence, expert, marvin, minsky, sagan, wrote, frequently, about, religion, and, the, relationship, between, religion, and, science, expressing, his, skepticism, about, the, conventional, conceptualization, of, god, as, a, sapient, being, for, example, some, people, think, god, is, an, outsized, light, skinned, male, with, a, long, white, beard, sitting, on, a, throne, somewhere, up, there, in, the, sky, busily, tallying, the, fall, of, every, sparrow, others, for, example, baruch, spinoza, and, albert, einstein, considered, god, to, be, essentially, the, sum, total, of, the, physical, laws, which, describe, the, universe, i, do, not, know, of, any, compelling, evidence, for, anthropomorphic, patriarchs, controlling, human, destiny, from, some, hidden, celestial, vantage, point, but, it, would, be, madness, to, deny, the, existence, of, physical, laws, in, another, description, of, his, view, on, the, concept, of, god, sagan, wrote, the, idea, that, god, is, an, oversized, white, male, with, a, flowing, beard, who, sits, in, the, sky, and, tallies, the, fall, of, every, sparrow, is, ludicrous, but, if, by, god, one, means, the, set, of, physical, laws, that, govern, the, universe, then, clearly, there, is, such, a, god, this, god, is, emotionally, unsatisfying, it, does, not, make, much, sense, to, pray, to, the, law, of, gravity, on, atheism, sagan, commented, in, 1981, an, atheist, is, someone, who, is, certain, that, god, does, not, exist, someone, who, has, compelling, evidence, against, the, existence, of, god, i, know, of, no, such, compelling, evidence, because, god, can, be, relegated, to, remote, times, and, places, and, to, ultimate, causes, we, would, have, to, know, a, great, deal, more, about, the, universe, than, we, do, now, to, be, sure, that, no, such, god, exists, to, be, certain, of, the, existence, of, god, and, to, be, certain, of, the, nonexistence, of, god, seem, to, me, to, be, the, confident, extremes, in, a, subject, so, riddled, with, doubt, and, uncertainty, as, to, inspire, very, little, confidence, indeed, sagan, also, commented, on, christianity, and, the, jefferson, bible, stating, my, long, time, view, about, christianity, is, that, it, represents, an, amalgam, of, two, seemingly, immiscible, parts, the, religion, of, jesus, and, the, religion, of, paul, thomas, jefferson, attempted, to, excise, the, pauline, parts, of, the, new, testament, there, wasn, t, much, left, when, he, was, done, but, it, was, an, inspiring, document, sagan, thought, that, spirituality, should, be, scientifically, informed, and, that, traditional, religions, should, be, abandoned, and, replaced, with, belief, systems, that, revolve, around, the, scientific, method, but, also, the, mystery, and, incompleteness, of, scientific, fields, regarding, spirituality, and, its, relationship, with, science, sagan, stated, spirit, comes, from, the, latin, word, to, breathe, what, we, breathe, is, air, which, is, certainly, matter, however, thin, despite, usage, to, the, contrary, there, is, no, necessary, implication, in, the, word, spiritual, that, we, are, talking, of, anything, other, than, matter, including, the, matter, of, which, the, brain, is, made, or, anything, outside, the, realm, of, science, on, occasion, i, will, feel, free, to, use, the, word, science, is, not, only, compatible, with, spirituality, it, is, a, profound, source, of, spirituality, when, we, recognize, our, place, in, an, immensity, of, light, years, and, in, the, passage, of, ages, when, we, grasp, the, intricacy, beauty, and, subtlety, of, life, then, that, soaring, feeling, that, sense, of, elation, and, humility, combined, is, surely, spiritual, an, environmental, appeal, preserving, and, cherishing, the, earth, primarily, written, by, sagan, and, signed, by, him, and, other, noted, scientists, as, well, as, religious, leaders, and, published, in, january, 1990, stated, that, the, historical, record, makes, clear, that, religious, teaching, example, and, leadership, are, powerfully, able, to, influence, personal, conduct, and, commitment, thus, there, is, a, vital, role, for, religion, and, science, in, reply, to, a, question, in, 1996, about, his, religious, beliefs, sagan, answered, i, m, agnostic, sagan, maintained, that, the, idea, of, a, creator, god, of, the, universe, was, difficult, to, prove, or, disprove, and, that, the, only, conceivable, scientific, discovery, that, could, challenge, it, would, be, an, infinitely, old, universe, his, son, dorion, sagan, said, my, father, believed, in, the, god, of, spinoza, and, einstein, god, not, behind, nature, but, as, nature, equivalent, to, it, his, last, wife, ann, druyan, stated, when, my, husband, died, because, he, was, so, famous, and, known, for, not, being, a, believer, many, people, would, come, up, to, me, it, still, sometimes, happens, and, ask, me, if, carl, changed, at, the, end, and, converted, to, a, belief, in, an, afterlife, they, also, frequently, ask, me, if, i, think, i, will, see, him, again, carl, faced, his, death, with, unflagging, courage, and, never, sought, refuge, in, illusions, the, tragedy, was, that, we, knew, we, would, never, see, each, other, again, i, don, t, ever, expect, to, be, reunited, with, carl, in, 2006, ann, druyan, edited, sagan, s, 1985, glasgow, gifford, lectures, in, natural, theology, into, a, book, the, varieties, of, scientific, experience, a, personal, view, of, the, search, for, god, in, which, he, elaborates, on, his, views, of, divinity, in, the, natural, world, sagan, is, also, widely, regarded, as, a, freethinker, or, skeptic, one, of, his, most, famous, quotations, in, cosmos, was, extraordinary, claims, require, extraordinary, evidence, called, the, sagan, standard, by, some, this, was, based, on, a, nearly, identical, statement, by, fellow, founder, of, the, committee, for, the, scientific, investigation, of, claims, of, the, paranormal, marcello, truzzi, an, extraordinary, claim, requires, extraordinary, proof, this, idea, had, been, earlier, aphorized, in, th, odore, flournoy, s, work, from, india, to, the, planet, mars, 1899, from, a, longer, quote, by, pierre, simon, laplace, 1749, 1827, a, french, mathematician, and, astronomer, as, the, principle, of, laplace, the, weight, of, the, evidence, should, be, proportioned, to, the, strangeness, of, the, facts, late, in, his, life, sagan, s, books, elaborated, on, his, naturalistic, view, of, the, world, in, the, demon, haunted, world, he, presented, tools, for, testing, arguments, and, detecting, fallacious, or, fraudulent, ones, essentially, advocating, the, wide, use, of, critical, thinking, and, of, the, scientific, method, the, compilation, billions, and, billions, thoughts, on, life, and, death, at, the, brink, of, the, millennium, published, in, 1997, after, sagan, s, death, contains, essays, written, by, him, on, topics, such, as, his, views, on, abortion, and, also, an, essay, by, his, widow, ann, druyan, about, the, relationship, between, his, agnostic, and, freethinking, beliefs, and, his, death, sagan, warned, against, humans, tendency, towards, anthropocentrism, he, was, the, faculty, adviser, for, the, cornell, students, for, the, ethical, treatment, of, animals, in, the, cosmos, chapter, blues, for, a, red, planet, sagan, wrote, if, there, is, life, on, mars, i, believe, we, should, do, nothing, with, mars, mars, then, belongs, to, the, martians, even, if, the, martians, are, only, microbes, sagan, was, a, user, and, advocate, of, marijuana, under, the, pseudonym, mr, x, he, contributed, an, essay, about, smoking, cannabis, to, the, 1971, book, marihuana, reconsidered, the, essay, explained, that, marijuana, use, had, helped, to, inspire, some, of, sagan, s, works, and, enhance, sensual, and, intellectual, experiences, after, sagan, s, death, his, friend, lester, grinspoon, disclosed, this, information, to, sagan, s, biographer, keay, davidson, the, publishing, of, the, biography, carl, sagan, a, life, in, 1999, brought, media, attention, to, this, aspect, of, sagan, s, life, not, long, after, his, death, his, widow, ann, druyan, went, on, to, preside, over, the, board, of, directors, of, the, national, organization, for, the, reform, of, marijuana, laws, norml, a, non, profit, organization, dedicated, to, reforming, cannabis, laws, in, 1947, the, year, that, inaugurated, the, flying, saucer, craze, the, young, sagan, suspected, the, discs, might, be, alien, spaceships, sagan, s, interest, in, ufo, reports, prompted, him, on, august, 3, 1952, to, write, a, letter, to, u, s, secretary, of, state, dean, acheson, to, ask, how, the, united, states, would, respond, if, flying, saucers, turned, out, to, be, extraterrestrial, he, later, had, several, conversations, on, the, subject, in, 1964, with, jacques, vall, e, though, quite, skeptical, of, any, extraordinary, answer, to, the, ufo, question, sagan, thought, scientists, should, study, the, phenomenon, at, least, because, there, was, widespread, public, interest, in, ufo, reports, stuart, appelle, notes, that, sagan, wrote, frequently, on, what, he, perceived, as, the, logical, and, empirical, fallacies, regarding, ufos, and, the, abduction, experience, sagan, rejected, an, extraterrestrial, explanation, for, the, phenomenon, but, felt, there, were, both, empirical, and, pedagogical, benefits, for, examining, ufo, reports, and, that, the, subject, was, therefore, a, legitimate, topic, of, study, in, 1966, sagan, was, a, member, of, the, ad, hoc, committee, to, review, project, blue, book, the, u, s, air, force, s, ufo, investigation, project, the, committee, concluded, blue, book, had, been, lacking, as, a, scientific, study, and, recommended, a, university, based, project, to, give, the, ufo, phenomenon, closer, scientific, scrutiny, the, result, was, the, condon, committee, 1966, 68, led, by, physicist, edward, condon, and, in, their, final, report, they, formally, concluded, that, ufos, regardless, of, what, any, of, them, actually, were, did, not, behave, in, a, manner, consistent, with, a, threat, to, national, security, sociologist, ron, westrum, writes, that, the, high, point, of, sagan, s, treatment, of, the, ufo, question, was, the, aaas, symposium, in, 1969, a, wide, range, of, educated, opinions, on, the, subject, were, offered, by, participants, including, not, only, proponents, such, as, james, mcdonald, and, j, allen, hynek, but, also, skeptics, like, astronomers, william, hartmann, and, donald, menzel, the, roster, of, speakers, was, balanced, and, it, is, to, sagan, s, credit, that, this, event, was, presented, in, spite, of, pressure, from, edward, condon, with, physicist, thornton, page, sagan, edited, the, lectures, and, discussions, given, at, the, symposium, these, were, published, in, 1972, as, ufo, s, a, scientific, debate, some, of, sagan, s, many, books, examine, ufos, as, did, one, episode, of, cosmos, and, he, claimed, a, religious, undercurrent, to, the, phenomenon, sagan, again, revealed, his, views, on, interstellar, travel, in, his, 1980, cosmos, series, in, one, of, his, last, written, works, sagan, argued, that, the, chances, of, extraterrestrial, spacecraft, visiting, earth, are, vanishingly, small, however, sagan, did, think, it, plausible, that, cold, war, concerns, contributed, to, governments, misleading, their, citizens, about, ufos, and, wrote, that, some, ufo, reports, and, analyses, and, perhaps, voluminous, files, have, been, made, inaccessible, to, the, public, which, pays, the, bills, it, s, time, for, the, files, to, be, declassified, and, made, generally, available, he, cautioned, against, jumping, to, conclusions, about, suppressed, ufo, data, and, stressed, that, there, was, no, strong, evidence, that, aliens, were, visiting, the, earth, either, in, the, past, or, present, sagan, briefly, served, as, an, adviser, on, stanley, kubrick, s, film, 2001, a, space, odyssey, sagan, proposed, that, the, film, suggest, rather, than, depict, extraterrestrial, superintelligence, sagan, s, contribution, to, the, 1969, aaas, symposium, was, an, attack, on, the, belief, that, ufos, are, piloted, by, extraterrestrial, beings, using, the, drake, equation, and, applying, several, logical, assumptions, sagan, calculated, the, possible, number, of, advanced, civilizations, capable, of, interstellar, travel, to, be, about, one, million, he, projected, that, any, civilization, wishing, to, check, on, all, the, others, on, a, regular, basis, of, say, once, a, year, would, have, to, launch, 10, 000, spacecraft, annually, not, only, does, that, seem, like, an, unreasonable, number, of, launchings, but, it, would, take, all, the, material, in, one, percent, of, the, universe, s, stars, to, produce, all, the, spaceships, needed, for, all, the, civilizations, to, seek, each, other, out, to, argue, that, the, earth, was, being, chosen, for, regular, visitations, sagan, said, one, would, have, to, assume, that, the, planet, is, somehow, unique, and, that, assumption, goes, exactly, against, the, idea, that, there, are, lots, of, civilizations, around, because, if, there, are, then, our, sort, of, civilization, must, be, pretty, common, and, if, we, re, not, pretty, common, then, there, aren, t, going, to, be, many, civilizations, advanced, enough, to, send, visitors, this, argument, which, some, called, sagan, s, paradox, helped, to, establish, a, new, school, of, thought, namely, the, belief, that, extraterrestrial, life, exists, but, has, nothing, to, do, with, ufos, the, new, belief, had, a, salutary, effect, on, ufo, studies, it, gave, scientists, opportunities, to, search, the, universe, for, intelligent, life, unencumbered, by, the, stigma, associated, with, ufos, after, suffering, from, myelodysplasia, for, two, years, and, receiving, three, bone, marrow, transplants, from, his, sister, sagan, died, from, pneumonia, at, the, age, of, 62, at, the, fred, hutchinson, cancer, research,
