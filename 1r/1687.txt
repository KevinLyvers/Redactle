ernest, rutherford, 1st, baron, rutherford, of, nelson, om, frs, honfrse, 30, august, 1871, 19, october, 1937, was, a, new, zealand, physicist, who, was, a, pioneering, researcher, in, both, atomic, and, nuclear, physics, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, nuclear, physics, and, the, greatest, experimentalist, since, michael, faraday, in, 1908, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, investigations, into, the, disintegration, of, the, elements, and, the, chemistry, of, radioactive, substances, he, was, the, first, oceanian, nobel, laureate, and, the, first, to, perform, the, awarded, work, in, canada, rutherford, s, discoveries, include, the, concept, of, radioactive, half, life, the, radioactive, element, radon, and, the, differentiation, and, naming, of, alpha, and, beta, radiation, together, with, thomas, royds, rutherford, is, credited, with, proving, that, alpha, radiation, is, composed, of, helium, nuclei, in, 1911, he, theorized, that, atoms, have, their, charge, concentrated, in, a, very, small, nucleus, this, was, done, through, his, discovery, and, interpretation, of, rutherford, scattering, during, the, gold, foil, experiment, performed, by, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, resulting, in, his, conception, of, the, rutherford, model, of, the, atom, in, 1917, he, performed, the, first, artificially, induced, nuclear, reaction, by, conducting, experiments, where, nitrogen, nuclei, were, bombarded, with, alpha, particles, as, a, result, he, discovered, the, emission, of, a, subatomic, particle, which, he, initially, called, the, hydrogen, atom, but, later, more, accurately, named, the, proton, he, is, also, credited, with, developing, the, atomic, numbering, system, alongside, henry, moseley, his, other, achievements, include, advancing, the, fields, of, radio, communications, and, ultrasound, technology, rutherford, became, director, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, at, the, university, of, cambridge, in, 1919, under, his, leadership, the, neutron, was, discovered, by, james, chadwick, in, 1932, in, the, same, year, the, first, controlled, experiment, to, split, the, nucleus, was, performed, by, john, cockcroft, and, ernest, walton, working, under, his, direction, in, honour, of, his, scientific, advancements, rutherford, was, recognised, as, a, baron, of, the, united, kingdom, after, his, death, in, 1937, he, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, near, charles, darwin, and, isaac, newton, the, chemical, element, rutherfordium, 104, rf, was, named, after, him, in, 1997, ernest, rutherford, was, born, on, 30, august, 1871, in, brightwater, a, town, near, nelson, new, zealand, he, was, the, fourth, of, twelve, children, of, james, rutherford, an, immigrant, farmer, and, mechanic, from, perth, scotland, and, his, wife, martha, thompson, a, schoolteacher, from, hornchurch, england, rutherford, s, birth, certificate, was, mistakenly, written, as, earnest, he, was, known, by, his, family, as, ern, when, rutherford, was, five, he, moved, to, foxhill, new, zealand, and, attended, foxhill, school, at, age, 11, in, 1883, the, rutherford, family, moved, to, havelock, a, town, in, the, marlborough, sounds, the, move, was, made, to, be, closer, to, the, flax, mill, rutherford, s, father, developed, ernest, studied, at, havelock, school, in, 1887, on, his, second, attempt, he, won, a, scholarship, to, study, at, nelson, college, on, his, first, examination, attempt, he, received, 75, out, of, 130, marks, for, geography, 76, out, of, 130, for, history, 101, out, of, 140, for, english, and, 200, out, of, 200, for, arithmetic, totalling, 452, out, of, 600, marks, with, these, marks, he, had, the, highest, of, anyone, from, nelson, when, he, was, awarded, the, scholarship, he, had, received, 580, out, of, 600, possible, marks, after, being, awarded, the, scholarship, havelock, school, presented, him, with, a, five, volume, set, of, books, titled, the, peoples, of, the, world, he, studied, at, nelson, college, between, 1887, and, 1889, and, was, head, boy, in, 1889, he, also, played, in, the, school, s, rugby, team, he, was, offered, a, cadetship, in, government, service, but, he, declined, as, he, still, had, 15, months, of, college, remaining, in, 1889, after, his, second, attempt, he, won, a, scholarship, to, study, at, canterbury, college, university, of, new, zealand, between, 1890, and, 1894, he, participated, in, its, debating, society, and, the, science, society, at, canterbury, he, was, awarded, a, complex, ba, in, latin, english, and, maths, in, 1892, a, ma, in, mathematics, and, physical, science, in, 1893, and, a, bsc, in, chemistry, and, geology, in, 1894, thereafter, he, invented, a, new, form, of, radio, receiver, and, in, 1895, rutherford, was, awarded, an, 1851, research, fellowship, from, the, royal, commission, for, the, exhibition, of, 1851, to, travel, to, england, for, postgraduate, study, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, university, of, cambridge, in, 1897, he, was, awarded, a, ba, research, degree, and, the, coutts, trotter, studentship, from, trinity, college, cambridge, when, rutherford, began, his, studies, at, cambridge, he, was, among, the, first, aliens, those, without, a, cambridge, degree, allowed, to, do, research, at, the, university, and, was, additionally, honoured, to, study, under, j, j, thomson, with, thomson, s, encouragement, rutherford, detected, radio, waves, at, 0, 5, miles, 800, m, and, briefly, held, the, world, record, for, the, distance, over, which, electromagnetic, waves, could, be, detected, although, when, he, presented, his, results, at, the, british, association, meeting, in, 1896, he, discovered, he, had, been, outdone, by, guglielmo, marconi, whose, radio, waves, had, sent, a, message, across, nearly, 10, miles, 16, km, again, under, thomson, s, leadership, rutherford, worked, on, the, conductive, effects, of, x, rays, on, gases, which, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, electron, the, results, first, presented, by, thomson, in, 1897, hearing, of, henri, becquerel, s, experience, with, uranium, rutherford, started, to, explore, its, radioactivity, discovering, two, types, that, differed, from, x, rays, in, their, penetrating, power, continuing, his, research, in, canada, in, 1899, he, coined, the, terms, alpha, ray, and, beta, ray, to, describe, these, two, distinct, types, of, radiation, in, 1898, rutherford, was, accepted, to, the, chair, of, macdonald, professor, of, physics, position, at, mcgill, university, in, montreal, canada, on, thomson, s, recommendation, from, 1900, to, 1903, he, was, joined, at, mcgill, by, the, young, chemist, frederick, soddy, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, 1921, for, whom, he, set, the, problem, of, identifying, the, noble, gas, emitted, by, the, radioactive, element, thorium, a, substance, which, was, itself, radioactive, and, would, coat, other, substances, once, he, had, eliminated, all, the, normal, chemical, reactions, soddy, suggested, that, it, must, be, one, of, the, inert, gases, which, they, named, thoron, this, substance, was, later, found, to, be, 220, rn, an, isotope, of, radon, they, also, found, another, substance, they, called, thorium, x, later, identified, as, 224, rn, and, continued, to, find, traces, of, helium, they, also, worked, with, samples, of, uranium, x, protactinium, from, william, crookes, and, radium, from, marie, curie, rutherford, further, investigated, thoron, in, conjunction, with, r, b, owens, and, found, that, a, sample, of, radioactive, material, of, any, size, invariably, took, the, same, amount, of, time, for, half, the, sample, to, decay, in, this, case, 11, 1, 2, minutes, a, phenomenon, for, which, he, coined, the, term, half, life, rutherford, and, soddy, published, their, paper, law, of, radioactive, change, to, account, for, all, their, experiments, until, then, atoms, were, assumed, to, be, the, indestructible, basis, of, all, matter, and, although, curie, had, suggested, that, radioactivity, was, an, atomic, phenomenon, the, idea, of, the, atoms, of, radioactive, substances, breaking, up, was, a, radically, new, idea, rutherford, and, soddy, demonstrated, that, radioactivity, involved, the, spontaneous, disintegration, of, atoms, into, other, as, yet, unidentified, matter, in, 1903, rutherford, considered, a, type, of, radiation, discovered, but, not, named, by, french, chemist, paul, villard, in, 1900, as, an, emission, from, radium, and, realised, that, this, observation, must, represent, something, different, from, his, own, alpha, and, beta, rays, due, to, its, very, much, greater, penetrating, power, rutherford, therefore, gave, this, third, type, of, radiation, the, name, of, gamma, ray, all, three, of, rutherford, s, terms, are, in, standard, use, today, other, types, of, radioactive, decay, have, since, been, discovered, but, rutherford, s, three, types, are, among, the, most, common, in, 1904, rutherford, suggested, that, radioactivity, provides, a, source, of, energy, sufficient, to, explain, the, existence, of, the, sun, for, the, many, millions, of, years, required, for, the, slow, biological, evolution, on, earth, proposed, by, biologists, such, as, charles, darwin, the, physicist, lord, kelvin, had, argued, earlier, for, a, much, younger, earth, based, on, the, insufficiency, of, known, energy, sources, but, rutherford, pointed, out, at, a, lecture, attended, by, kelvin, that, radioactivity, could, solve, this, problem, later, that, year, he, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, and, in, 1907, he, returned, to, britain, to, take, the, chair, of, physics, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, in, manchester, rutherford, continued, his, work, with, alpha, radiation, in, conjunction, with, hans, geiger, he, developed, zinc, sulfide, scintillation, screens, and, ionisation, chambers, to, count, alpha, particles, by, dividing, the, total, charge, accumulated, on, the, screen, by, the, number, counted, rutherford, determined, that, the, charge, on, the, alpha, particle, was, two, 61, in, late, 1907, ernest, rutherford, and, thomas, royds, allowed, alphas, to, penetrate, a, very, thin, window, into, an, evacuated, tube, as, they, sparked, the, tube, into, discharge, the, spectrum, obtained, from, it, changed, as, the, alphas, accumulated, in, the, tube, eventually, the, clear, spectrum, of, helium, gas, appeared, proving, that, alphas, were, at, least, ionised, helium, atoms, and, probably, helium, nuclei, in, 1910, rutherford, with, geiger, and, mathematician, harry, bateman, published, their, classic, paper, 94, describing, the, first, analysis, of, the, distribution, in, time, of, radioactive, emission, a, distribution, now, called, the, poisson, distribution, ernest, rutherford, was, awarded, the, 1908, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, his, investigations, into, the, disintegration, of, the, elements, and, the, chemistry, of, radioactive, substances, rutherford, continued, to, make, ground, breaking, discoveries, long, after, receiving, the, nobel, prize, in, 1908, 63, under, his, direction, in, 1909, hans, geiger, and, ernest, marsden, performed, the, geiger, marsden, experiment, which, demonstrated, the, nuclear, nature, of, atoms, by, measuring, the, deflection, of, alpha, particles, passing, through, a, thin, gold, foil, rutherford, was, inspired, to, ask, geiger, and, marsden, in, this, experiment, to, look, for, alpha, particles, with, very, high, deflection, angles, which, was, not, expected, according, to, any, theory, of, matter, at, that, time, such, deflection, angles, although, rare, were, found, reflecting, on, these, results, in, one, of, his, last, lectures, rutherford, was, quoted, as, saying, it, was, quite, the, most, incredible, event, that, has, ever, happened, to, me, in, my, life, it, was, almost, as, incredible, as, if, you, fired, a, 15, inch, shell, at, a, piece, of, tissue, paper, and, it, came, back, and, hit, you, it, was, rutherford, s, interpretation, of, this, data, that, led, him, to, formulate, the, rutherford, model, of, the, atom, in, 1911, that, a, very, small, charged, nucleus, containing, much, of, the, atom, s, mass, in, 1912, rutherford, was, joined, by, niels, bohr, who, postulated, that, electrons, moved, in, specific, orbits, about, the, compact, nucleus, bohr, adapted, rutherford, s, nuclear, structure, to, be, consistent, with, max, planck, s, quantum, hypothesis, the, resulting, rutherford, bohr, model, was, the, basis, for, quantum, mechanical, atomic, physics, of, heisenberg, which, remains, valid, today, during, world, war, i, rutherford, worked, on, a, top, secret, project, to, solve, the, practical, problems, of, submarine, detection, both, rutherford, and, paul, langevin, suggested, the, use, of, piezoelectricity, and, rutherford, successfully, developed, a, device, which, measured, its, output, the, use, of, piezoelectricity, then, became, essential, to, the, development, of, ultrasound, as, it, is, known, today, the, claim, that, rutherford, developed, sonar, however, is, a, misconception, as, subaquatic, detection, technologies, utilise, langevin, s, transducer, together, with, h, g, moseley, rutherford, developed, the, atomic, numbering, system, in, 1913, rutherford, and, moseley, s, experiments, used, cathode, rays, to, bombard, various, elements, with, streams, of, electrons, and, observed, that, each, element, responded, in, a, consistent, and, distinct, manner, their, research, was, the, first, to, assert, that, each, element, could, be, defined, by, the, properties, of, its, inner, structures, an, observation, that, later, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, atomic, nucleus, this, research, led, rutherford, to, theorize, that, the, hydrogen, atom, at, the, time, the, least, massive, entity, known, to, bear, a, positive, charge, was, a, sort, of, positive, electron, a, component, of, every, atomic, element, it, was, not, until, 1919, that, rutherford, expanded, upon, his, theory, of, the, positive, electron, with, a, series, of, experiments, beginning, shortly, before, the, end, of, his, time, at, manchester, he, found, that, nitrogen, and, other, light, elements, ejected, a, proton, which, he, called, a, hydrogen, atom, when, hit, with, alpha, particles, in, particular, he, showed, that, particles, ejected, by, alpha, particles, colliding, with, hydrogen, have, unit, charge, and, 1, 4, the, momentum, of, alpha, particles, rutherford, returned, to, the, cavendish, laboratory, in, 1919, succeeding, j, j, thomson, as, the, cavendish, professor, and, the, laboratory, s, director, posts, that, he, held, until, his, death, in, 1937, during, his, tenure, nobel, prizes, were, awarded, to, james, chadwick, for, discovering, the, neutron, in, 1932, john, cockcroft, and, ernest, walton, for, an, experiment, that, was, to, be, known, as, splitting, the, atom, using, a, particle, accelerator, and, edward, appleton, for, demonstrating, the, existence, of, the, ionosphere, in, 1919, 1920, rutherford, continued, his, research, on, the, hydrogen, atom, to, confirm, that, alpha, particles, break, down, nitrogen, nuclei, and, to, affirm, the, nature, of, the, products, this, result, showed, rutherford, that, hydrogen, nuclei, were, a, part, of, nitrogen, nuclei, and, by, inference, probably, other, nuclei, as, well, such, a, construction, had, been, suspected, for, many, years, on, the, basis, of, atomic, weights, that, were, integral, multiples, of, that, of, hydrogen, see, prout, s, hypothesis, hydrogen, was, known, to, be, the, lightest, element, and, its, nuclei, presumably, the, lightest, nuclei, now, because, of, all, these, considerations, rutherford, decided, that, a, hydrogen, nucleus, was, possibly, a, fundamental, building, block, of, all, nuclei, and, also, possibly, a, new, fundamental, particle, as, well, since, nothing, was, known, to, be, lighter, than, that, nucleus, thus, confirming, and, extending, the, work, of, wilhelm, wien, who, in, 1898, discovered, the, proton, in, streams, of, ionized, gas, in, 1920, rutherford, postulated, the, hydrogen, nucleus, to, be, a, new, particle, which, he, dubbed, the, proton, in, 1921, while, working, with, niels, bohr, rutherford, theorized, about, the, existence, of, neutrons, which, he, had, christened, in, his, 1920, bakerian, lecture, which, could, somehow, compensate, for, the, repelling, effect, of, the, positive, charges, of, protons, by, causing, an, attractive, nuclear, force, and, thus, keep, the, nuclei, from, flying, apart, due, to, the, repulsion, between, protons, the, only, alternative, to, neutrons, was, the, existence, of, nuclear, electrons, which, would, counteract, some, of, the, proton, charges, in, the, nucleus, since, by, then, it, was, known, that, nuclei, had, about, twice, the, mass, that, could, be, accounted, for, if, they, were, simply, assembled, from, hydrogen, nuclei, protons, but, how, these, nuclear, electrons, could, be, trapped, in, the, nucleus, was, a, mystery, in, 1932, rutherford, s, theory, of, neutrons, was, proved, by, his, associate, james, chadwick, who, recognised, neutrons, immediately, when, they, were, produced, by, other, scientists, and, later, himself, in, bombarding, beryllium, with, alpha, particles, in, 1935, chadwick, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, this, discovery, rutherford, s, four, part, article, on, the, collision, of, particles, with, light, atoms, he, reported, two, additional, fundamental, and, far, reaching, discoveries, 237, first, he, showed, that, at, high, angles, the, scattering, of, alpha, particles, from, hydrogen, differed, from, the, theoretical, results, he, himself, published, in, 1911, these, were, the, first, results, to, probe, the, interactions, that, hold, a, nucleus, together, second, he, showed, that, particles, colliding, with, nitrogen, nuclei, would, react, rather, than, simply, bounce, off, one, product, of, the, reaction, was, the, proton, the, other, product, was, shown, by, patrick, blackett, rutherford, s, colleague, and, former, student, to, be, oxygen, blackett, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1948, for, his, work, in, perfecting, the, high, speed, cloud, chamber, apparatus, used, to, make, that, discovery, and, many, others, rutherford, therefore, recognised, that, the, nucleus, may, increase, rather, than, diminish, in, mass, as, the, result, of, collisions, in, which, the, proton, is, expelled, rutherford, received, significant, recognition, in, his, home, country, of, new, zealand, in, 1901, he, earned, a, dsc, from, the, university, of, new, zealand, in, 1916, he, was, awarded, the, hector, memorial, medal, in, 1925, rutherford, called, for, the, new, zealand, government, to, support, education, and, research, which, led, to, the, formation, of, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, dsir, in, the, following, year, in, 1933, rutherford, was, one, of, the, two, inaugural, recipients, of, the, t, k, sidey, medal, which, was, established, by, the, royal, society, of, new, zealand, as, an, award, for, outstanding, scientific, research, additionally, rutherford, received, a, number, of, awards, from, the, british, crown, he, was, knighted, in, 1914, he, was, appointed, to, the, order, of, merit, in, the, 1925, new, year, honours, between, 1925, and, 1930, he, served, as, president, of, the, royal, society, and, later, as, president, of, the, academic, assistance, council, which, helped, almost, 1, 000, university, refugees, from, germany, in, 1931, was, raised, to, baron, of, the, united, kingdom, under, the, title, baron, rutherford, of, nelson, decorating, his, coat, of, arms, with, a, kiwi, and, a, m, ori, warrior, the, title, became, extinct, upon, his, unexpected, death, in, 1937, the, young, rutherford, made, his, grandmother, a, wooden, potato, masher, which, was, believed, to, have, been, made, during, the, school, holidays, it, has, been, held, in, the, collection, of, the, royal, society, since, 1888, in, 1900, rutherford, married, mary, georgina, newton, 1876, 1954, to, whom, he, had, become, engaged, before, leaving, new, zealand, at, st, paul, s, anglican, church, papanui, in, christchurch, they, had, one, daughter, eileen, mary, 1901, 1930, who, married, the, physicist, ralph, fowler, rutherford, s, hobbies, included, golf, and, motoring, for, some, time, before, his, death, rutherford, had, a, small, hernia, which, he, neglected, to, have, fixed, and, it, became, strangulated, rendering, him, violently, ill, despite, an, emergency, operation, in, london, he, died, four, days, afterwards, at, cambridge, on, 19, october, 1937, at, age, 66, of, what, physicians, termed, intestinal, paralysis, after, cremation, at, golders, green, crematorium, he, was, given, the, high, honour, of, burial, in, westminster, abbey, near, isaac, newton, and, other, illustrious, british, scientists, such, as, charles, darwin, rutherford, is, considered, to, be, among, the, greatest, scientists, in, history, at, the, opening, session, of, the, 1938, indian, science, congress, which, rutherford, had, been, expected, to, preside, over, before, his, death, astrophysicist, james, jeans, spoke, in, his, place, and, deemed, him, one, of, the, greatest, scientists, of, all, time, saying, in, his, flair, for, the, right, line, of, approach, to, a, problem, as, well, as, in, the, simple, directness, of, his, methods, of, attack, often, reminds, us, of, faraday, but, he, had, two, great, advantages, which, faraday, did, not, possess, first, exuberant, bodily, health, and, energy, and, second, the, opportunity, and, capacity, to, direct, a, band, of, enthusiastic, co, workers, great, though, faraday, s, output, of, work, was, it, seems, to, me, that, to, match, rutherford, s, work, in, quantity, as, well, as, in, quality, we, must, go, back, to, newton, in, some, respects, he, was, more, fortunate, than, newton, rutherford, was, ever, the, happy, warrior, happy, in, his, work, happy, in, its, outcome, and, happy, in, its, human, contacts, rutherford, is, known, as, the, father, of, nuclear, physics, because, his, research, and, work, done, under, him, as, laboratory, director, established, the, nuclear, structure, of, the, atom, and, the, essential, nature, of, radioactive, decay, as, a, nuclear, process, patrick, blackett, a, research, fellow, working, under, rutherford, using, natural, alpha, particles, demonstrated, induced, nuclear, transmutation, later, rutherford, s, team, using, protons, from, an, accelerator, demonstrated, artificially, induced, nuclear, reactions, and, transmutation, rutherford, died, too, early, to, see, le, szil, rd, s, idea, of, controlled, nuclear, chain, reactions, come, into, being, however, a, speech, of, rutherford, s, about, his, artificially, induced, transmutation, in, lithium, printed, in, the, 12, september, 1933, issue, of, the, times, was, reported, by, szil, rd, to, have, been, his, inspiration, for, thinking, of, the, possibility, of, a, controlled, energy, producing, nuclear, chain, reaction, rutherford, s, speech, touched, on, the, 1932, work, of, his, students, john, cockcroft, and, ernest, walton, in, splitting, lithium, into, alpha, particles, by, bombardment, with, protons, from, a, particle, accelerator, they, had, constructed, rutherford, realised, that, the, energy, released, from, the, split, lithium, atoms, was, enormous, but, he, also, realised, that, the, energy, needed, for, the, accelerator, and, its, essential, inefficiency, in, splitting, atoms, in, this, fashion, made, the, project, an, impossibility, as, a, practical, source, of, energy, accelerator, induced, fission, of, light, elements, remains, too, inefficient, to, be, used, in, this, way, even, today, rutherford, s, speech, in, part, read, we, might, in, these, processes, obtain, very, much, more, energy, than, the, proton, supplied, but, on, the, average, we, could, not, expect, to, obtain, energy, in, this, way, it, was, a, very, poor, and, inefficient, way, of, producing, energy, and, anyone, who, looked, for, a, source, of, power, in, the, transformation, of, the, atoms, was, talking, moonshine, but, the, subject, was, scientifically, interesting, because, it, gave, insight, into, the, atoms, the, element, rutherfordium, rf, z, 104, was, named, in, honour, of, rutherford, in, 1997
