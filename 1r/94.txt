albrecht, d, rer, dj, r, r, german, 21, may, 1471, 6, april, 1528, sometimes, spelled, in, english, as, durer, was, a, german, painter, printmaker, and, theorist, of, the, german, renaissance, born, in, nuremberg, d, rer, established, his, reputation, and, influence, across, europe, in, his, twenties, due, to, his, high, quality, woodcut, prints, he, was, in, contact, with, the, major, italian, artists, of, his, time, including, raphael, giovanni, bellini, fra, luca, pacioli, and, leonardo, da, vinci, and, from, 1512, was, patronized, by, emperor, maximilian, i, d, rer, s, vast, body, of, work, includes, engravings, his, preferred, technique, in, his, later, prints, altarpieces, portraits, and, self, portraits, watercolours, and, books, the, woodcuts, series, are, stylistically, more, gothic, than, the, rest, of, his, work, but, revolutionised, the, potential, of, that, medium, while, his, extraordinary, handling, of, the, burin, expanded, especially, the, tonal, range, of, his, engravings, well, known, engravings, include, the, three, meisterstiche, master, prints, knight, death, and, the, devil, 1513, saint, jerome, in, his, study, 1514, and, melencolia, i, 1514, his, watercolours, mark, him, as, one, of, the, first, european, landscape, artists, and, with, his, confident, self, portraits, he, pioneered, them, as, well, as, autonomous, subjects, of, art, d, rer, s, introduction, of, classical, motifs, and, of, the, nude, into, northern, art, through, his, knowledge, of, italian, artists, and, german, humanists, has, secured, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, most, important, figures, of, the, northern, renaissance, this, is, reinforced, by, his, theoretical, treatises, which, involve, principles, of, mathematics, for, linear, perspective, and, body, proportions, d, rer, was, born, on, 21, may, 1471, the, third, child, and, second, son, of, albrecht, d, rer, the, elder, and, barbara, holper, who, married, in, 1467, albrecht, d, rer, the, elder, originally, albrecht, ajt, si, was, a, successful, goldsmith, who, by, 1455, had, moved, to, nuremberg, from, ajt, s, near, gyula, in, hungary, he, married, barbara, his, master, s, daughter, when, he, himself, qualified, as, a, master, her, mother, kinga, llinger, had, some, roots, in, hungary, too, as, she, was, born, in, sopron, the, couple, had, eighteen, children, together, of, which, only, three, survived, hans, d, rer, 1490, 1534, became, also, a, painter, trained, under, the, older, albrecht, the, other, surviving, brother, endres, d, rer, 1484, 1555, took, over, their, father, s, business, and, was, a, master, goldsmith, the, german, name, d, rer, is, a, translation, from, the, hungarian, ajt, si, initially, it, was, t, rer, meaning, doormaker, which, is, ajt, s, in, hungarian, from, ajt, meaning, door, a, door, is, featured, in, the, coat, of, arms, the, family, acquired, albrecht, d, rer, the, younger, later, changed, t, rer, his, father, s, diction, of, the, family, s, surname, to, d, rer, to, adapt, to, the, local, nuremberg, dialect, because, d, rer, left, autobiographical, writings, and, was, widely, known, by, his, mid, twenties, his, life, is, well, documented, in, several, sources, after, a, few, years, of, school, d, rer, learned, the, basics, of, goldsmithing, and, drawing, from, his, father, though, his, father, wanted, him, to, continue, his, training, as, a, goldsmith, he, showed, such, a, precocious, talent, in, drawing, that, he, was, allowed, to, start, as, an, apprentice, to, michael, wolgemut, at, the, age, of, fifteen, in, 1486, a, self, portrait, a, drawing, in, silverpoint, is, dated, 1484, albertina, vienna, when, i, was, a, child, as, his, later, inscription, says, the, drawing, is, one, of, the, earliest, surviving, children, s, drawings, of, any, kind, and, as, d, rer, s, opus, one, has, helped, define, his, oeuvre, as, deriving, from, and, always, linked, to, himself, wolgemut, was, the, leading, artist, in, nuremberg, at, the, time, with, a, large, workshop, producing, a, variety, of, works, of, art, in, particular, woodcuts, for, books, nuremberg, was, then, an, important, and, prosperous, city, a, centre, for, publishing, and, many, luxury, trades, it, had, strong, links, with, italy, especially, venice, a, relatively, short, distance, across, the, alps, d, rer, s, godfather, anton, koberger, left, goldsmithing, to, become, a, printer, and, publisher, in, the, year, of, d, rer, s, birth, he, became, the, most, successful, publisher, in, germany, eventually, owning, twenty, four, printing, presses, and, a, number, of, offices, in, germany, and, abroad, koberger, s, most, famous, publication, was, the, nuremberg, chronicle, published, in, 1493, in, german, and, latin, editions, it, contained, an, unprecedented, 1, 809, woodcut, illustrations, albeit, with, many, repeated, uses, of, the, same, block, by, the, wolgemut, workshop, d, rer, may, have, worked, on, some, of, these, as, the, work, on, the, project, began, while, he, was, with, wolgemut, after, completing, his, apprenticeship, d, rer, followed, the, common, german, custom, of, taking, wanderjahre, in, effect, gap, years, in, which, the, apprentice, learned, skills, from, other, masters, their, local, tradition, and, individual, styles, d, rer, was, to, spend, about, four, years, away, he, left, in, 1490, possibly, to, work, under, martin, schongauer, the, leading, engraver, of, northern, europe, but, who, died, shortly, before, d, rer, s, arrival, at, colmar, in, 1492, it, is, unclear, where, d, rer, travelled, in, the, intervening, period, though, it, is, likely, that, he, went, to, frankfurt, and, the, netherlands, in, colmar, d, rer, was, welcomed, by, schongauer, s, brothers, the, goldsmiths, caspar, and, paul, and, the, painter, ludwig, later, that, year, d, rer, travelled, to, basel, to, stay, with, another, brother, of, martin, schongauer, the, goldsmith, georg, in, 1493, d, rer, went, to, strasbourg, where, he, would, have, experienced, the, sculpture, of, nikolaus, gerhaert, d, rer, s, first, painted, self, portrait, now, in, the, louvre, was, painted, at, this, time, probably, to, be, sent, back, to, his, fianc, e, in, nuremberg, very, soon, after, his, return, to, nuremberg, on, 7, july, 1494, at, the, age, of, 23, d, rer, was, married, to, agnes, frey, following, an, arrangement, made, during, his, absence, agnes, was, the, daughter, of, a, prominent, brass, worker, and, amateur, harpist, in, the, city, however, no, children, resulted, from, the, marriage, and, with, albrecht, the, d, rer, name, died, out, the, marriage, between, agnes, and, albrecht, was, believed, not, to, be, a, generally, happy, one, as, indicated, by, a, letter, of, d, rer, in, which, he, quipped, to, willibald, pirckheimer, in, a, rough, tone, about, his, wife, calling, her, an, old, crow, and, made, other, vulgar, remarks, pirckheimer, also, made, no, secret, of, his, antipathy, towards, agnes, describing, her, as, a, miserly, shrew, with, a, bitter, tongue, who, helped, cause, d, rer, s, death, at, a, young, age, it, has, been, hypothesized, by, many, scholars, that, albrecht, was, bisexual, or, homosexual, due, to, the, recurrence, of, allegedly, homoerotic, themes, in, some, of, his, works, e, g, the, men, s, bath, and, the, nature, of, his, correspondence, with, close, friends, within, three, months, of, his, marriage, d, rer, left, for, italy, alone, perhaps, stimulated, by, an, outbreak, of, plague, in, nuremberg, he, made, watercolour, sketches, as, he, traveled, over, the, alps, some, have, survived, and, others, may, be, deduced, from, accurate, landscapes, of, real, places, in, his, later, work, for, example, his, engraving, nemesis, in, italy, he, went, to, venice, to, study, its, more, advanced, artistic, world, through, wolgemut, s, tutelage, d, rer, had, learned, how, to, make, prints, in, drypoint, and, design, woodcuts, in, the, german, style, based, on, the, works, of, schongauer, and, the, housebook, master, he, also, would, have, had, access, to, some, italian, works, in, germany, but, the, two, visits, he, made, to, italy, had, an, enormous, influence, on, him, he, wrote, that, giovanni, bellini, was, the, oldest, and, still, the, best, of, the, artists, in, venice, his, drawings, and, engravings, show, the, influence, of, others, notably, antonio, del, pollaiuolo, with, his, interest, in, the, proportions, of, the, body, lorenzo, di, credi, and, andrea, mantegna, whose, work, he, produced, copies, of, while, training, d, rer, probably, also, visited, padua, and, mantua, on, this, trip, on, his, return, to, nuremberg, in, 1495, d, rer, opened, his, own, workshop, being, married, was, a, requirement, for, this, over, the, next, five, years, his, style, increasingly, integrated, italian, influences, into, underlying, northern, forms, arguably, his, best, works, in, the, first, years, of, the, workshop, were, his, woodcut, prints, mostly, religious, but, including, secular, scenes, such, as, the, men, s, bath, c, 1496, these, were, larger, and, more, finely, cut, than, the, great, majority, of, german, woodcuts, hitherto, and, far, more, complex, and, balanced, in, composition, it, is, now, thought, unlikely, that, d, rer, cut, any, of, the, woodblocks, himself, this, task, would, have, been, performed, by, a, specialist, craftsman, however, his, training, in, wolgemut, s, studio, which, made, many, carved, and, painted, altarpieces, and, both, designed, and, cut, woodblocks, for, woodcut, evidently, gave, him, great, understanding, of, what, the, technique, could, be, made, to, produce, and, how, to, work, with, block, cutters, d, rer, either, drew, his, design, directly, onto, the, woodblock, itself, or, glued, a, paper, drawing, to, the, block, either, way, his, drawings, were, destroyed, during, the, cutting, of, the, block, his, series, of, sixteen, designs, for, the, apocalypse, is, dated, 1498, as, is, his, engraving, of, st, michael, fighting, the, dragon, he, made, the, first, seven, scenes, of, the, great, passion, in, the, same, year, and, a, little, later, a, series, of, eleven, on, the, holy, family, and, saints, the, seven, sorrows, polyptych, commissioned, by, frederick, iii, of, saxony, in, 1496, was, executed, by, d, rer, and, his, assistants, c, 1500, in, 1502, d, rer, s, father, died, around, 1503, 1505, d, rer, produced, the, first, 17, of, a, set, illustrating, the, life, of, the, virgin, which, he, did, not, finish, for, some, years, neither, these, nor, the, great, passion, were, published, as, sets, until, several, years, later, but, prints, were, sold, individually, in, considerable, numbers, during, the, same, period, d, rer, perfected, the, difficult, art, of, using, the, burin, to, make, engravings, most, likely, he, had, learned, this, skill, during, his, early, training, with, his, father, as, it, was, also, an, essential, skill, of, the, goldsmith, in, 1496, he, executed, the, prodigal, son, which, the, italian, renaissance, art, historian, giorgio, vasari, singled, out, for, praise, some, decades, later, noting, its, germanic, quality, he, was, soon, producing, some, spectacular, and, original, images, notably, nemesis, 1502, the, sea, monster, 1498, and, saint, eustace, c, 1501, with, a, highly, detailed, landscape, background, and, animals, his, landscapes, of, this, period, such, as, pond, in, the, woods, and, willow, mill, are, quite, different, from, his, earlier, watercolours, there, is, a, much, greater, emphasis, on, capturing, atmosphere, rather, than, depicting, topography, he, made, a, number, of, madonnas, single, religious, figures, and, small, scenes, with, comic, peasant, figures, prints, are, highly, portable, and, these, works, made, d, rer, famous, throughout, the, main, artistic, centres, of, europe, within, a, very, few, years, the, venetian, artist, jacopo, de, barbari, whom, d, rer, had, met, in, venice, visited, nuremberg, in, 1500, and, d, rer, said, that, he, learned, much, about, the, new, developments, in, perspective, anatomy, and, proportion, from, him, to, d, rer, it, seemed, that, de, barbari, was, unwilling, to, explain, everything, he, knew, so, he, began, his, own, studies, which, would, become, a, lifelong, preoccupation, a, series, of, extant, drawings, show, d, rer, s, experiments, in, human, proportion, leading, to, the, famous, engraving, of, adam, and, eve, 1504, which, shows, his, subtlety, while, using, the, burin, in, the, texturing, of, flesh, surfaces, this, is, the, only, existing, engraving, signed, with, his, full, name, d, rer, created, large, numbers, of, preparatory, drawings, especially, for, his, paintings, and, engravings, and, many, survive, most, famously, the, betende, h, nde, praying, hands, from, circa, 1508, a, study, for, an, apostle, in, the, heller, altarpiece, he, continued, to, make, images, in, watercolour, and, bodycolour, usually, combined, including, a, number, of, still, lifes, of, meadow, sections, or, animals, including, his, young, hare, 1502, and, the, great, piece, of, turf, 1503, in, italy, he, returned, to, painting, at, first, producing, a, series, of, works, executed, in, tempera, on, linen, these, include, portraits, and, altarpieces, notably, the, paumgartner, altarpiece, and, the, adoration, of, the, magi, in, early, 1506, he, returned, to, venice, and, stayed, there, until, the, spring, of, 1507, by, this, time, d, rer, s, engravings, had, attained, great, popularity, and, were, being, copied, in, venice, he, was, given, a, valuable, commission, from, the, emigrant, german, community, for, the, church, of, san, bartolomeo, this, was, the, altar, piece, known, as, the, feast, of, the, rosary, or, the, feast, of, rose, garlands, it, shows, pope, julius, ii, and, emperor, maximilian, i, peacefully, kneeling, in, adoration, before, her, throne, both, with, their, crowns, taken, off, it, also, includes, portraits, of, members, of, venice, s, german, community, and, of, d, rer, himself, on, the, upper, right, holding, a, designation, of, his, authorship, besides, the, flemish, verism, in, the, depiction, of, the, greenery, and, the, garments, and, the, use, of, his, own, hues, the, altar, piece, shows, a, strong, italian, influence, it, was, later, acquired, by, the, emperor, rudolf, ii, and, taken, to, prague, despite, the, regard, in, which, he, was, held, by, the, venetians, d, rer, returned, to, nuremberg, by, mid, 1507, remaining, in, germany, until, 1520, his, reputation, had, spread, throughout, europe, and, he, was, on, friendly, terms, and, in, communication, with, many, of, the, major, artists, including, raphael, between, 1507, and, 1511, d, rer, worked, on, some, of, his, most, celebrated, paintings, adam, and, eve, 1507, martyrdom, of, the, ten, thousand, 1508, for, frederick, of, saxony, virgin, with, the, iris, 1508, the, altarpiece, assumption, of, the, virgin, 1509, for, jacob, heller, of, frankfurt, and, adoration, of, the, trinity, 1511, for, matthaeus, landauer, during, this, period, he, also, completed, two, woodcut, series, the, great, passion, and, the, life, of, the, virgin, both, published, in, 1511, together, with, a, second, edition, of, the, apocalypse, series, the, post, venetian, woodcuts, show, d, rer, s, development, of, chiaroscuro, modelling, effects, creating, a, mid, tone, throughout, the, print, to, which, the, highlights, and, shadows, can, be, contrasted, other, works, from, this, period, include, the, thirty, seven, little, passion, woodcuts, first, published, in, 1511, and, a, set, of, fifteen, small, engravings, on, the, same, theme, in, 1512, complaining, that, painting, did, not, make, enough, money, to, justify, the, time, spent, when, compared, to, his, prints, he, produced, no, paintings, from, 1513, to, 1516, in, 1513, and, 1514, d, rer, created, his, three, most, famous, engravings, knight, death, and, the, devil, 1513, probably, based, on, erasmus, s, handbook, of, a, christian, knight, st, jerome, in, his, study, and, the, much, debated, melencolia, i, both, 1514, the, year, d, rer, s, mother, died, further, outstanding, pen, and, ink, drawings, of, d, rer, s, period, of, art, work, of, 1513, were, drafts, for, his, friend, pirckheimer, these, drafts, were, later, used, to, design, lusterweibchen, chandeliers, combining, an, antler, with, a, wooden, sculpture, in, 1515, he, created, his, woodcut, of, a, rhinoceros, which, had, arrived, in, lisbon, from, a, written, description, and, sketch, by, another, artist, without, ever, seeing, the, animal, himself, an, image, of, the, indian, rhinoceros, the, image, has, such, force, that, it, remains, one, of, his, best, known, and, was, still, used, in, some, german, school, science, text, books, as, late, as, last, century, in, the, years, leading, to, 1520, he, produced, a, wide, range, of, works, including, the, woodblocks, for, the, first, western, printed, star, charts, in, 1515, and, portraits, in, tempera, on, linen, in, 1516, his, only, experiments, with, etching, came, in, this, period, producing, five, between, 1515, 1516, and, a, sixth, in, 1518, a, technique, he, may, have, abandoned, as, unsuited, to, his, aesthetic, of, methodical, classical, form, from, 1512, maximilian, i, became, d, rer, s, major, patron, he, commissioned, the, triumphal, arch, a, vast, work, printed, from, 192, separate, blocks, the, symbolism, of, which, is, partly, informed, by, pirckheimer, s, translation, of, horapollo, s, hieroglyphica, the, design, program, and, explanations, were, devised, by, johannes, stabius, the, architectural, design, by, the, master, builder, and, court, painter, j, rg, k, lderer, and, the, woodcutting, itself, by, hieronymous, andreae, with, d, rer, as, designer, in, chief, the, arch, was, followed, by, the, triumphal, procession, the, program, of, which, was, worked, out, in, 1512, by, marx, treitz, saurwein, and, includes, woodcuts, by, albrecht, altdorfer, and, hans, springinklee, as, well, as, d, rer, d, rer, worked, with, pen, on, the, marginal, images, for, an, edition, of, the, emperor, s, printed, prayer, book, these, were, quite, unknown, until, facsimiles, were, published, in, 1808, as, part, of, the, first, book, published, in, lithography, d, rer, s, work, on, the, book, was, halted, for, an, unknown, reason, and, the, decoration, was, continued, by, artists, including, lucas, cranach, the, elder, and, hans, baldung, d, rer, also, made, several, portraits, of, the, emperor, including, one, shortly, before, maximilian, s, death, in, 1519, maximilian, was, a, very, cash, strapped, prince, who, sometimes, failed, to, pay, yet, turned, out, to, be, d, rer, s, most, important, patron, in, his, court, artists, and, learned, men, were, respected, which, was, not, common, at, that, time, later, d, rer, commented, that, in, germany, as, a, non, noble, he, was, treated, as, a, parasite, pirckheimer, who, he, met, in, 1495, before, entering, the, service, of, maximilian, was, also, an, important, personage, in, the, court, and, great, cultural, patron, who, had, a, strong, influence, on, d, rer, as, his, tutor, in, classical, knowledge, and, humanistic, critical, methodology, as, well, as, collaborator, in, maximilian, s, court, d, rer, also, collaborated, with, a, great, number, of, other, brilliant, artists, and, scholars, of, the, time, who, became, his, friends, like, johannes, stabius, konrad, peutinger, conrad, celtes, and, hans, tscherte, an, imperial, architect, d, rer, manifested, a, strong, pride, in, his, ability, as, a, prince, of, his, profession, one, day, the, emperor, trying, to, show, d, rer, an, idea, tried, to, sketch, with, the, charcoal, himself, but, always, broke, it, d, rer, took, the, charcoal, from, maximilian, s, hand, finished, the, drawing, and, told, him, this, is, my, scepter, in, another, occasion, maximilian, noticed, that, the, ladder, d, rer, used, was, too, short, and, unstable, thus, told, a, noble, to, hold, it, for, him, the, noble, refused, saying, that, it, was, beneath, him, to, serve, a, non, noble, maximilian, then, came, to, hold, the, ladder, himself, and, told, the, noble, that, he, could, make, a, noble, out, of, a, peasant, any, day, but, he, could, not, make, an, artist, like, d, rer, out, of, a, noble, this, story, and, a, 1849, painting, depicting, it, by, august, siegert, have, become, relevant, recently, this, nineteenth, century, painting, shows, d, rer, painting, a, mural, at, st, stephen, s, cathedral, vienna, apparently, this, reflects, a, seventeenth, century, artists, legend, about, the, previously, mentioned, encounter, in, which, the, emperor, held, the, ladder, that, this, encounter, corresponds, with, the, period, d, rer, was, working, on, the, viennese, murals, in, 2020, during, restoration, work, art, connoisseurs, discovered, a, piece, of, handwriting, now, attributed, to, d, rer, suggesting, that, the, nuremberg, master, had, actually, participated, in, creating, the, murals, at, st, stephen, s, cathedral, in, the, recent, 2022, d, rer, exhibition, in, nuremberg, in, which, the, drawing, technique, is, also, traced, and, connected, to, d, rer, s, other, works, the, identity, of, the, commissioner, is, discussed, now, the, painting, of, siegert, and, the, legend, associated, with, it, is, used, as, evidence, to, suggest, that, this, was, maximilian, d, rer, is, historically, recorded, to, have, entered, the, emperor, s, service, in, 1511, and, the, mural, s, date, is, calculated, to, be, around, 1505, but, it, is, possible, they, have, known, and, worked, with, each, other, earlier, than, 1511, d, rer, s, exploration, of, space, led, to, a, relationship, and, cooperation, with, the, court, astronomer, johannes, stabius, stabius, also, often, acted, as, d, rer, s, and, maximilian, s, go, between, for, their, financial, problems, in, 1515, d, rer, and, stabius, created, the, first, world, map, projected, on, a, solid, geometric, sphere, also, in, 1515, stabius, d, rer, and, the, astronomer, konrad, heinfogel, produced, the, first, planispheres, of, both, southern, and, northerns, hemispheres, as, well, as, the, first, printed, celestial, maps, which, prompted, the, revival, of, interest, in, the, field, of, uranometry, throughout, europe, maximilian, s, death, came, at, a, time, when, d, rer, was, concerned, he, was, losing, my, sight, and, freedom, of, hand, perhaps, caused, by, arthritis, and, increasingly, affected, by, the, writings, of, martin, luther, in, july, 1520, d, rer, made, his, fourth, and, last, major, journey, to, renew, the, imperial, pension, maximilian, had, given, him, and, to, secure, the, patronage, of, the, new, emperor, charles, v, who, was, to, be, crowned, at, aachen, d, rer, journeyed, with, his, wife, and, her, maid, via, the, rhine, to, cologne, and, then, to, antwerp, where, he, was, well, received, and, produced, numerous, drawings, in, silverpoint, chalk, and, charcoal, in, addition, to, attending, the, coronation, he, visited, cologne, where, he, admired, the, painting, of, stefan, lochner, nijmegen, s, hertogenbosch, bruges, where, he, saw, michelangelo, s, madonna, of, bruges, ghent, where, he, admired, jan, van, eyck, s, ghent, altarpiece, and, zeeland, d, rer, took, a, large, stock, of, prints, with, him, and, wrote, in, his, diary, to, whom, he, gave, exchanged, or, sold, them, and, for, how, much, this, provides, rare, information, of, the, monetary, value, placed, on, prints, at, this, time, unlike, paintings, their, sale, was, very, rarely, documented, while, providing, valuable, documentary, evidence, d, rer, s, netherlandish, diary, also, reveals, that, the, trip, was, not, a, profitable, one, for, example, d, rer, offered, his, last, portrait, of, maximilian, to, his, daughter, margaret, of, austria, but, eventually, traded, the, picture, for, some, white, cloth, after, margaret, disliked, the, portrait, and, declined, to, accept, it, during, this, trip, he, also, met, bernard, van, orley, jan, provoost, gerard, horenbout, jean, mone, joachim, patinir, and, tommaso, vincidor, though, he, did, not, it, seems, meet, quentin, matsys, having, secured, his, pension, d, rer, returned, home, in, july, 1521, having, caught, an, undetermined, illness, which, afflicted, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, greatly, reduced, his, rate, of, work, on, his, return, to, nuremberg, d, rer, worked, on, a, number, of, grand, projects, with, religious, themes, including, a, crucifixion, scene, and, a, sacra, conversazione, though, neither, was, completed, this, may, have, been, due, in, part, to, his, declining, health, but, perhaps, also, because, of, the, time, he, gave, to, the, preparation, of, his, theoretical, works, on, geometry, and, perspective, the, proportions, of, men, and, horses, and, fortification, however, one, consequence, of, this, shift, in, emphasis, was, that, during, the, last, years, of, his, life, d, rer, produced, comparatively, little, as, an, artist, in, painting, there, was, only, a, portrait, of, hieronymus, holtzschuher, a, madonna, and, child, 1526, salvator, mundi, 1526, and, two, panels, showing, st, john, with, st, peter, and, st, paul, with, st, mark, beside, him, this, last, great, work, the, four, apostles, was, given, by, d, rer, to, the, city, of, nuremberg, although, he, was, given, 100, guilders, in, return, as, for, engravings, d, rer, s, work, was, restricted, to, portraits, and, illustrations, for, his, treatise, the, portraits, include, his, boyhood, friend, willibald, pirckheimer, cardinal, elector, albert, of, mainz, frederick, the, wise, elector, of, saxony, philipp, melanchthon, and, erasmus, of, rotterdam, for, those, of, the, cardinal, melanchthon, and, d, rer, s, final, major, work, a, drawn, portrait, of, the, nuremberg, patrician, ulrich, starck, d, rer, depicted, the, sitters, in, profile, despite, complaining, of, his, lack, of, a, formal, classical, education, d, rer, was, greatly, interested, in, intellectual, matters, and, learned, much, from, willibald, pirckheimer, whom, he, no, doubt, consulted, on, the, content, of, many, of, his, images, he, also, derived, great, satisfaction, from, his, friendships, and, correspondence, with, erasmus, and, other, scholars, d, rer, succeeded, in, producing, two, books, during, his, lifetime, the, four, books, on, measurement, were, published, at, nuremberg, in, 1525, and, was, the, first, book, for, adults, on, mathematics, in, german, as, well, as, being, cited, later, by, galileo, and, kepler, the, other, a, work, on, city, fortifications, was, published, in, 1527, the, four, books, on, human, proportion, were, published, posthumously, shortly, after, his, death, in, 1528, d, rer, died, in, nuremberg, at, the, age, of, 56, leaving, an, estate, valued, at, 6, 874, florins, a, considerable, sum, he, is, buried, in, the, johannisfriedhof, cemetery, his, large, house, purchased, in, 1509, from, the, heirs, of, the, astronomer, bernhard, walther, where, his, workshop, was, located, and, where, his, widow, lived, until, her, death, in, 1539, remains, a, prominent, nuremberg, landmark, d, rer, s, writings, suggest, that, he, may, have, been, sympathetic, to, luther, s, ideas, though, it, is, unclear, if, he, ever, left, the, catholic, church, d, rer, wrote, of, his, desire, to, draw, luther, in, his, diary, in, 1520, and, god, help, me, that, i, may, go, to, dr, martin, luther, thus, i, intend, to, make, a, portrait, of, him, with, great, care, and, engrave, him, on, a, copper, plate, to, create, a, lasting, memorial, of, the, christian, man, who, helped, me, overcome, so, many, difficulties, in, a, letter, to, nicholas, kratzer, in, 1524, d, rer, wrote, because, of, our, christian, faith, we, have, to, stand, in, scorn, and, danger, for, we, are, reviled, and, called, heretics, most, tellingly, pirckheimer, wrote, in, a, letter, to, johann, tscherte, in, 1530, i, confess, that, in, the, beginning, i, believed, in, luther, like, our, albert, of, blessed, memory, but, as, anyone, can, see, the, situation, has, become, worse, d, rer, may, even, have, contributed, to, the, nuremberg, city, council, s, mandating, lutheran, sermons, and, services, in, march, 1525, notably, d, rer, had, contacts, with, various, reformers, such, as, zwingli, andreas, karlstadt, melanchthon, erasmus, and, cornelius, grapheus, from, whom, d, rer, received, luther, s, babylonian, captivity, in, 1520, yet, erasmus, and, c, grapheus, are, better, said, to, be, catholic, change, agents, also, from, 1525, the, year, that, saw, the, peak, and, collapse, of, the, peasants, war, the, artist, can, be, seen, to, distance, himself, somewhat, from, the, movement, d, rer, s, later, works, have, also, been, claimed, to, show, protestant, sympathies, his, 1523, the, last, supper, woodcut, has, often, been, understood, to, have, an, evangelical, theme, focusing, as, it, does, on, christ, espousing, the, gospel, as, well, as, the, inclusion, of, the, eucharistic, cup, an, expression, of, protestant, utraquism, although, this, interpretation, has, been, questioned, the, delaying, of, the, engraving, of, st, philip, completed, in, 1523, but, not, distributed, until, 1526, may, have, been, due, to, d, rer, s, uneasiness, with, images, of, saints, even, if, d, rer, was, not, an, iconoclast, in, his, last, years, he, evaluated, and, questioned, the, role, of, art, in, religion, in, all, his, theoretical, works, in, order, to, communicate, his, theories, in, the, german, language, rather, than, in, latin, d, rer, used, graphic, expressions, based, on, a, vernacular, craftsmen, s, language, for, example, schneckenlinie, snail, line, was, his, term, for, a, spiral, form, thus, d, rer, contributed, to, the, expansion, in, german, prose, which, luther, had, begun, with, his, translation, of, the, bible, d, rer, s, work, on, geometry, is, called, the, four, books, on, measurement, underweysung, der, messung, mit, dem, zirckel, und, richtscheyt, or, instructions, for, measuring, with, compass, and, ruler, the, first, book, focuses, on, linear, geometry, d, rer, s, geometric, constructions, include, helices, conchoids, and, epicycloids, he, also, draws, on, apollonius, and, johannes, werner, s, libellus, super, viginti, duobus, elementis, conicis, of, 1522, the, second, book, moves, onto, two, dimensional, geometry, i, e, the, construction, of, regular, polygons, here, d, rer, favours, the, methods, of, ptolemy, over, euclid, the, third, book, applies, these, principles, of, geometry, to, architecture, engineering, and, typography, in, architecture, d, rer, cites, vitruvius, but, elaborates, his, own, classical, designs, and, columns, in, typography, d, rer, depicts, the, geometric, construction, of, the, latin, alphabet, relying, on, italian, precedent, however, his, construction, of, the, gothic, alphabet, is, based, upon, an, entirely, different, modular, system, the, fourth, book, completes, the, progression, of, the, first, and, second, by, moving, to, three, dimensional, forms, and, the, construction, of, polyhedra, here, d, rer, discusses, the, five, platonic, solids, as, well, as, seven, archimedean, semi, regular, solids, as, well, as, several, of, his, own, invention, d, rer, s, work, on, human, proportions, is, called, the, four, books, on, human, proportion, vier, b, cher, von, menschlicher, proportion, of, 1528, the, first, book, was, mainly, composed, by, 1512, 13, and, completed, by, 1523, showing, five, differently, constructed, types, of, both, male, and, female, figures, all, parts, of, the, body, expressed, in, fractions, of, the, total, height, d, rer, based, these, constructions, on, both, vitruvius, and, empirical, observations, of, two, to, three, hundred, living, persons, in, his, own, words, the, second, book, includes, eight, further, types, broken, down, not, into, fractions, but, an, albertian, system, which, d, rer, probably, learned, from, francesco, di, giorgio, s, de, harmonica, mundi, totius, of, 1525, in, the, third, book, d, rer, gives, principles, by, which, the, proportions, of, the, figures, can, be, modified, including, the, mathematical, simulation, of, convex, and, concave, mirrors, here, d, rer, also, deals, with, human, physiognomy, the, fourth, book, is, devoted, to, the, theory, of, movement, appended, to, the, last, book, however, is, a, self, contained, essay, on, aesthetics, which, d, rer, worked, on, between, 1512, and, 1528, and, it, is, here, that, we, learn, of, his, theories, concerning, ideal, beauty, d, rer, rejected, alberti, s, concept, of, an, objective, beauty, proposing, a, relativist, notion, of, beauty, based, on, variety, nonetheless, d, rer, still, believed, that, truth, was, hidden, within, nature, and, that, there, were, rules, which, ordered, beauty, even, though, he, found, it, difficult, to, define, the, criteria, for, such, a, code, in, 1512, 13, his, three, criteria, were, function, nutz, na, ve, approval, wohlgefallen, and, the, happy, medium, mittelmass, however, unlike, alberti, and, leonardo, d, rer, was, most, troubled, by, understanding, not, just, the, abstract, notions, of, beauty, but, also, as, to, how, an, artist, can, create, beautiful, images, between, 1512, and, the, final, draft, in, 1528, d, rer, s, belief, developed, from, an, understanding, of, human, creativity, as, spontaneous, or, inspired, to, a, concept, of, selective, inward, synthesis, in, other, words, that, an, artist, builds, on, a, wealth, of, visual, experiences, in, order, to, imagine, beautiful, things, d, rer, s, belief, in, the, abilities, of, a, single, artist, over, inspiration, prompted, him, to, assert, that, one, man, may, sketch, something, with, his, pen, on, half, a, sheet, of, paper, in, one, day, or, may, cut, it, into, a, tiny, piece, of, wood, with, his, little, iron, and, it, turns, out, to, be, better, and, more, artistic, than, another, s, work, at, which, its, author, labours, with, the, utmost, diligence, for, a, whole, year, in, 1527, d, rer, also, published, various, lessons, on, the, fortification, of, cities, castles, and, localities, etliche, underricht, zu, befestigung, der, stett, schloss, und, flecken, it, was, printed, in, nuremberg, probably, by, hieronymus, andreae, and, reprinted, in, 1603, by, johan, janssenn, in, arnhem, in, 1535, it, was, also, translated, into, latin, as, on, cities, forts, and, castles, designed, and, strengthened, by, several, manners, presented, for, the, most, necessary, accommodation, of, war, de, vrbibus, arcibus, castellisque, condendis, ac, muniendis, rationes, aliquot, praesenti, bellorum, necessitati, accommodatissimae, published, by, christian, wechel, wecheli, wechelus, in, paris, the, work, is, less, proscriptively, theoretical, than, his, other, works, and, was, soon, overshadowed, by, the, italian, theory, of, polygonal, fortification, the, trace, italienne, see, bastion, fort, though, his, designs, seem, to, have, had, some, influence, in, the, eastern, german, lands, and, up, into, the, baltic, region, d, rer, created, many, sketches, and, woodcuts, of, soldiers, and, knights, over, the, course, of, his, life, his, most, significant, martial, works, however, were, made, in, 1512, as, part, of, his, efforts, to, secure, the, patronage, of, maximilian, i, using, existing, manuscripts, from, the, nuremberg, group, as, his, reference, his, workshop, produced, the, extensive, sive, armorvm, tractandorvm, meditatio, alberti, dvreri, weapon, training, or, albrecht, d, rer, s, meditation, on, the, handling, of, weapons, ms, 26, 232, another, manuscript, based, on, the, nuremberg, texts, as, well, as, one, of, hans, talhoffer, s, works, the, untitled, berlin, picture, book, libr, pict, a, 83, is, also, thought, to, have, originated, in, his, workshop, around, this, time, these, sketches, and, watercolours, show, the, same, careful, attention, to, detail, and, human, proportion, as, d, rer, s, other, work, and, his, illustrations, of, grappling, long, sword, dagger, and, messer, are, among, the, highest, quality, in, any, fencing, manual, d, rer, exerted, a, huge, influence, on, the, artists, of, succeeding, generations, especially, in, printmaking, the, medium, through, which, his, contemporaries, mostly, experienced, his, art, as, his, paintings, were, predominantly, in, private, collections, located, in, only, a, few, cities, his, success, in, spreading, his, reputation, across, europe, through, prints, was, undoubtedly, an, inspiration, for, major, artists, such, as, raphael, titian, and, parmigianino, all, of, whom, collaborated, with, printmakers, to, promote, and, distribute, their, work, his, engravings, seem, to, have, had, an, intimidating, effect, upon, his, german, successors, the, little, masters, who, attempted, few, large, engravings, but, continued, d, rer, s, themes, in, small, rather, cramped, compositions, lucas, van, leyden, was, the, only, northern, european, engraver, to, successfully, continue, to, produce, large, engravings, in, the, first, third, of, the, 16th, century, the, generation, of, italian, engravers, who, trained, in, the, shadow, of, d, rer, all, either, directly, copied, parts, of, his, landscape, backgrounds, giulio, campagnola, giovanni, battista, palumba, benedetto, montagna, and, cristofano, robetta, or, whole, prints, marcantonio, raimondi, and, agostino, veneziano, however, d, rer, s, influence, became, less, dominant, after, 1515, when, marcantonio, perfected, his, new, engraving, style, which, in, turn, travelled, over, the, alps, to, also, dominate, northern, engraving, in, painting, d, rer, had, relatively, little, influence, in, italy, where, probably, only, his, altarpiece, in, venice, was, seen, and, his, german, successors, were, less, effective, in, blending, german, and, italian, styles, his, intense, and, self, dramatizing, self, portraits, have, continued, to, have, a, strong, influence, up, to, the, present, especially, on, painters, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, century, who, desired, a, more, dramatic, portrait, style, d, rer, has, never, fallen, from, critical, favour, and, there, have, been, significant, revivals, of, interest, in, his, works, in, germany, in, the, d, rer, renaissance, of, about, 1570, to, 1630, in, the, early, nineteenth, century, and, in, german, nationalism, from, 1870, to, 1945, the, lutheran, church, commemorates, d, rer, annually, on, 6, april, along, with, michelangelo, lucas, cranach, the, elder, and, hans, burgkmair, in, 1993, two, of, d, rer, s, drawings, women, s, bathhouse, valued, at, about, 10, million, and, sitting, mary, with, child, along, with, other, works, of, art, were, stolen, from, the, national, art, museum, of, azerbaijan, the, drawings, were, later, recovered
