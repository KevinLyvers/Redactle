antonio, lucio, vivaldi, 4, march, 1678, 28, july, 1741, was, an, italian, composer, virtuoso, violinist, and, impresario, of, baroque, music, along, with, johann, sebastian, bach, and, george, frideric, handel, vivaldi, ranks, amongst, the, greatest, baroque, composers, and, his, influence, during, his, lifetime, was, widespread, across, europe, giving, origin, to, many, imitators, and, admirers, he, pioneered, many, developments, in, orchestration, violin, technique, and, programmatic, music, he, consolidated, the, emerging, concerto, form, into, a, widely, accepted, and, followed, idiom, vivaldi, composed, many, instrumental, concertos, for, the, violin, and, a, variety, of, other, musical, instruments, as, well, as, sacred, choral, works, and, more, than, fifty, operas, his, best, known, work, is, a, series, of, violin, concertos, known, as, the, four, seasons, many, of, his, compositions, were, written, for, the, all, female, music, ensemble, of, the, ospedale, della, piet, a, home, for, abandoned, children, vivaldi, began, studying, for, the, priesthood, at, the, age, of, 15, and, was, ordained, at, 25, but, was, given, dispensation, to, no, longer, say, public, masses, due, to, a, health, problem, vivaldi, also, had, some, success, with, expensive, stagings, of, his, operas, in, venice, mantua, and, vienna, after, meeting, the, emperor, charles, vi, vivaldi, moved, to, vienna, hoping, for, royal, support, however, the, emperor, died, soon, after, vivaldi, s, arrival, and, vivaldi, himself, died, in, poverty, less, than, a, year, later, after, almost, two, centuries, of, decline, vivaldi, s, musical, reputation, underwent, a, revival, in, the, early, 20th, century, with, much, scholarly, research, devoted, to, his, work, many, of, vivaldi, s, compositions, once, thought, lost, have, been, rediscovered, some, as, recently, as, 2015, his, music, remains, widely, popular, in, the, present, day, and, is, regularly, played, all, over, the, world, antonio, lucio, vivaldi, was, born, on, 4, march, 1678, in, venice, then, the, capital, of, the, republic, of, venice, he, was, son, of, giovanni, battista, vivaldi, and, camilla, calicchio, as, recorded, in, the, register, of, san, giovanni, in, bragora, he, was, baptized, immediately, after, his, birth, at, his, home, by, the, midwife, the, reason, for, which, has, led, to, speculation, it, was, most, likely, done, due, to, his, poor, health, there, is, a, false, rumor, that, an, earthquake, struck, the, city, that, day, this, rumor, may, have, originated, from, an, earthquake, that, struck, venice, on, 17, april, 1688, the, baptismal, ceremonies, which, had, been, omitted, were, supplied, two, months, later, vivaldi, had, five, known, siblings, bonaventura, tomaso, margarita, gabriela, cecilia, maria, francesco, gaetano, and, zanetta, anna, vivaldi, s, health, was, problematic, one, of, his, symptoms, strettezza, di, petto, tightness, of, the, chest, has, been, interpreted, as, a, form, of, asthma, this, did, not, prevent, him, from, learning, to, play, the, violin, composing, or, taking, part, in, musical, activities, although, it, prevented, him, from, playing, wind, instruments, his, father, giovanni, battista, was, a, barber, before, becoming, a, professional, violinist, and, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, sovvegno, dei, musicisti, di, santa, cecilia, an, association, of, musicians, he, taught, antonio, to, play, the, violin, and, then, toured, venice, playing, the, violin, with, his, young, son, antonio, was, probably, taught, at, an, early, age, judging, by, the, extensive, musical, knowledge, he, had, acquired, by, the, age, of, 24, when, he, started, working, at, the, ospedale, della, piet, the, president, of, the, sovvegno, was, giovanni, legrenzi, an, early, baroque, composer, and, the, maestro, di, cappella, at, st, mark, s, basilica, it, is, possible, that, legrenzi, gave, the, young, antonio, his, first, lessons, in, composition, vivaldi, s, father, may, have, been, a, composer, himself, in, 1689, an, opera, titled, la, fedelt, sfortunata, was, composed, by, a, giovanni, battista, rossi, the, name, under, which, vivaldi, s, father, had, joined, the, sovvegno, di, santa, cecilia, in, 1691, at, the, age, of, thirteen, vivaldi, wrote, an, early, liturgical, work, laetatus, sum, rv, anh, 31, in, 1693, at, the, age, of, fifteen, he, began, studying, to, become, a, priest, he, was, ordained, in, 1703, aged, 25, and, was, soon, nicknamed, il, prete, rosso, the, red, priest, rosso, is, italian, for, red, and, would, have, referred, to, the, color, of, his, hair, a, family, trait, although, vivaldi, is, most, famous, as, a, composer, he, was, regarded, as, an, exceptional, technical, violinist, as, well, the, german, architect, johann, friedrich, armand, von, uffenbach, referred, to, vivaldi, as, the, famous, composer, and, violinist, and, noted, in, his, diary, that, vivaldi, played, a, solo, accompaniment, excellently, and, at, the, conclusion, he, added, a, free, fantasy, which, absolutely, astounded, me, for, it, is, hardly, possible, that, anyone, has, ever, played, or, ever, will, play, in, such, a, fashion, in, september, 1703, vivaldi, 24, became, maestro, di, violino, master, of, violin, at, an, orphanage, called, the, pio, ospedale, della, piet, devout, hospital, of, mercy, in, venice, although, his, talents, as, a, violinist, probably, secured, him, the, job, he, soon, became, a, successful, teacher, of, music, there, over, the, next, thirty, years, he, composed, most, of, his, major, works, while, working, at, the, ospedale, there, were, four, similar, institutions, in, venice, their, purpose, was, to, give, shelter, and, education, to, children, who, were, abandoned, or, orphaned, or, whose, families, could, not, support, them, they, were, financed, by, funds, provided, by, the, republic, the, boys, learned, a, trade, and, had, to, leave, when, they, reached, the, age, of, fifteen, the, girls, received, a, musical, education, and, the, most, talented, among, them, stayed, and, became, members, of, the, ospedale, s, renowned, orchestra, and, choir, shortly, after, vivaldi, s, appointment, the, orphans, began, to, gain, appreciation, and, esteem, abroad, too, vivaldi, wrote, concertos, cantatas, and, sacred, vocal, music, for, them, these, sacred, works, which, number, over, 60, are, varied, they, included, solo, motets, and, large, scale, choral, works, for, soloists, double, chorus, and, orchestra, in, 1704, the, position, of, teacher, of, viola, all, inglese, was, added, to, his, duties, as, violin, instructor, the, position, of, maestro, di, coro, which, was, at, one, time, filled, by, vivaldi, required, a, lot, of, time, and, work, he, had, to, compose, an, oratorio, or, concerto, for, every, feast, and, teach, the, orphans, both, music, theory, and, how, to, play, certain, instruments, his, relationship, with, the, board, of, directors, of, the, ospedale, was, often, strained, the, board, had, to, vote, every, year, on, whether, to, keep, a, teacher, the, vote, on, vivaldi, was, seldom, unanimous, and, went, 7, to, 6, against, him, in, 1709, in, 1711, after, a, year, as, a, freelance, musician, he, was, recalled, by, the, ospedale, with, a, unanimous, vote, clearly, during, his, year, s, absence, the, board, had, realized, the, importance, of, his, role, he, became, responsible, for, all, of, the, musical, activity, of, the, institution, when, he, was, promoted, to, maestro, de, concerti, music, director, in, 1716, and, responsible, for, composing, two, new, concertos, every, month, in, 1705, the, first, collection, connor, cassara, of, his, works, was, published, by, giuseppe, sala, his, opus, 1, is, a, collection, of, 12, sonatas, for, two, violins, and, basso, continuo, in, a, conventional, style, in, 1709, a, second, collection, of, 12, sonatas, for, violin, and, basso, continuo, appeared, opus, 2, a, real, breakthrough, as, a, composer, came, with, his, first, collection, of, 12, concerti, for, one, two, and, four, violins, with, strings, l, estro, armonico, opus, 3, which, was, published, in, amsterdam, in, 1711, by, estienne, roger, and, dedicated, to, grand, prince, ferdinand, of, tuscany, the, prince, sponsored, many, musicians, including, alessandro, scarlatti, and, george, frideric, handel, he, was, a, musician, himself, and, vivaldi, probably, met, him, in, venice, l, estro, armonico, was, a, resounding, success, all, over, europe, it, was, followed, in, 1714, by, la, stravaganza, opus, 4, a, collection, of, concerti, for, solo, violin, and, strings, and, dedicated, to, an, old, violin, student, of, vivaldi, s, the, venetian, noble, vettor, dolfin, in, february, 1711, vivaldi, and, his, father, traveled, to, brescia, where, his, setting, of, the, stabat, mater, rv, 621, was, played, as, part, of, a, religious, festival, the, work, seems, to, have, been, written, in, haste, the, string, parts, are, simple, the, music, of, the, first, three, movements, is, repeated, in, the, next, three, and, not, all, the, text, is, set, nevertheless, perhaps, in, part, because, of, the, forced, essentiality, of, the, music, the, work, is, considered, to, be, one, of, his, early, masterpieces, despite, his, frequent, travels, from, 1718, the, ospedale, paid, him, 2, sequins, to, write, two, concerti, a, month, for, the, orchestra, and, to, rehearse, with, them, at, least, five, times, when, in, venice, the, orphanage, s, records, show, that, he, was, paid, for, 140, concerti, between, 1723, and, 1733, in, early, 18th, century, venice, opera, was, the, most, popular, musical, entertainment, it, proved, most, profitable, for, vivaldi, there, were, several, theaters, competing, for, the, public, s, attention, vivaldi, started, his, career, as, an, opera, composer, as, a, sideline, his, first, opera, ottone, in, villa, rv, 729, was, performed, not, in, venice, but, at, the, garzerie, theater, in, vicenza, in, 1713, the, following, year, vivaldi, became, the, impresario, of, the, teatro, san, angelo, in, venice, where, his, opera, orlando, finto, pazzo, rv, 727, was, performed, the, work, was, not, to, the, public, s, taste, and, it, closed, after, a, couple, of, weeks, being, replaced, with, a, repeat, of, a, different, work, already, given, the, previous, year, in, 1715, he, presented, nerone, fatto, cesare, rv, 724, now, lost, with, music, by, seven, different, composers, of, which, he, was, the, leader, the, opera, contained, eleven, arias, and, was, a, success, in, the, late, season, vivaldi, planned, to, put, on, an, opera, entirely, of, his, own, creation, arsilda, regina, di, ponto, rv, 700, but, the, state, censor, blocked, the, performance, the, main, character, arsilda, falls, in, love, with, another, woman, lisea, who, is, pretending, to, be, a, man, vivaldi, got, the, censor, to, accept, the, opera, the, following, year, and, it, was, a, resounding, success, during, this, period, the, piet, commissioned, several, liturgical, works, the, most, important, were, two, oratorios, moyses, deus, pharaonis, rv, 643, is, now, lost, the, second, juditha, triumphans, rv, 644, celebrates, the, victory, of, the, republic, of, venice, against, the, turks, and, the, recapture, of, the, island, of, corfu, composed, in, 1716, it, is, one, of, his, sacred, masterpieces, all, eleven, singing, parts, were, performed, by, girls, of, the, orphanage, both, the, female, and, male, roles, many, of, the, arias, include, parts, for, solo, instruments, recorders, oboes, violas, d, amore, and, mandolins, that, showcased, the, range, of, talents, of, the, girls, also, in, 1716, vivaldi, wrote, and, produced, two, more, operas, l, incoronazione, di, dario, rv, 719, and, la, costanza, trionfante, degli, amori, e, degli, odi, rv, 706, the, latter, was, so, popular, that, it, was, performed, two, years, later, re, edited, and, retitled, artabano, re, dei, parti, rv, 701, now, lost, it, was, also, performed, in, prague, in, 1732, in, the, years, that, followed, vivaldi, wrote, several, operas, that, were, performed, all, over, italy, his, progressive, operatic, style, caused, him, some, trouble, with, more, conservative, musicians, such, as, benedetto, marcello, a, magistrate, and, amateur, musician, who, wrote, a, pamphlet, denouncing, vivaldi, and, his, operas, the, pamphlet, il, teatro, alla, moda, attacks, the, composer, even, though, it, does, not, mention, him, directly, the, cover, drawing, shows, a, boat, the, san, angelo, on, the, left, end, of, which, stands, a, little, angel, wearing, a, priest, s, hat, and, playing, the, violin, the, marcello, family, claimed, ownership, of, the, teatro, san, angelo, and, a, long, legal, battle, had, been, fought, with, the, management, for, its, restitution, without, success, the, obscure, text, under, the, engraving, mentions, non, existent, places, and, names, for, example, aldiviva, is, an, anagram, of, a, vivaldi, in, a, letter, written, by, vivaldi, to, his, patron, marchese, bentivoglio, in, 1737, he, makes, reference, to, his, 94, operas, only, about, 50, operas, by, vivaldi, have, been, discovered, and, no, other, documentation, of, the, remaining, operas, exists, although, vivaldi, could, have, been, exaggerating, it, is, plausible, that, in, his, dual, role, of, composer, and, impresario, he, might, have, either, written, or, been, responsible, for, the, production, of, as, many, as, 94, operas, given, that, his, career, had, by, then, spanned, almost, 25, years, although, vivaldi, certainly, composed, many, operas, in, his, time, he, never, attained, the, prominence, of, other, great, composers, such, as, alessandro, scarlatti, johann, adolph, hasse, leonardo, leo, and, baldassare, galuppi, as, evidenced, by, his, inability, to, keep, a, production, running, for, an, extended, period, of, time, in, any, major, opera, house, in, 1717, or, 1718, vivaldi, was, offered, a, prestigious, new, position, as, maestro, di, cappella, of, the, court, of, prince, philip, of, hesse, darmstadt, governor, of, mantua, in, the, northwest, of, italy, he, moved, there, for, three, years, and, produced, several, operas, among, them, tito, manlio, rv, 738, in, 1721, he, was, in, milan, where, he, presented, the, pastoral, drama, la, silvia, rv, 734, nine, arias, from, it, survive, he, visited, milan, again, the, following, year, with, the, oratorio, l, adorazione, delli, tre, re, magi, al, bambino, ges, rv, 645, now, lost, in, 1722, he, moved, to, rome, where, he, introduced, his, operas, new, style, the, new, pope, benedict, xiii, invited, vivaldi, to, play, for, him, in, 1725, vivaldi, returned, to, venice, where, he, produced, four, operas, in, the, same, year, during, this, period, vivaldi, wrote, the, four, seasons, four, violin, concertos, that, give, musical, expression, to, the, seasons, of, the, year, the, composition, is, probably, one, of, his, most, famous, although, three, of, the, concerti, are, wholly, original, the, first, spring, borrows, motifs, from, a, sinfonia, in, the, first, act, of, vivaldi, s, contemporaneous, opera, il, giustino, the, inspiration, for, the, concertos, was, probably, the, countryside, around, mantua, they, were, a, revolution, in, musical, conception, in, them, vivaldi, represented, flowing, streams, singing, birds, of, different, species, each, specifically, characterized, barking, dogs, buzzing, mosquitoes, crying, shepherds, storms, drunken, dancers, silent, nights, hunting, parties, from, both, the, hunters, and, the, prey, s, point, of, view, frozen, landscapes, ice, skating, children, and, warming, winter, fires, each, concerto, is, associated, with, a, sonnet, possibly, by, vivaldi, describing, the, scenes, depicted, in, the, music, they, were, published, as, the, first, four, concertos, in, a, collection, of, twelve, il, cimento, dell, armonia, e, dell, inventione, opus, 8, published, in, amsterdam, by, michel, charles, le, c, ne, in, 1725, during, his, time, in, mantua, vivaldi, became, acquainted, with, an, aspiring, young, singer, anna, tessieri, gir, who, would, become, his, student, prot, g, e, and, favorite, prima, donna, anna, along, with, her, older, half, sister, paolina, moved, in, with, vivaldi, and, regularly, accompanied, him, on, his, many, travels, there, was, speculation, as, to, the, nature, of, vivaldi, s, and, gir, s, relationship, but, no, evidence, exists, to, indicate, anything, beyond, friendship, and, professional, collaboration, vivaldi, in, fact, adamantly, denied, any, romantic, relationship, with, gir, in, a, letter, to, his, patron, bentivoglio, dated, 16, november, 1737, vivaldi, collaborated, with, choreographer, giovanni, gallo, on, several, of, his, later, operas, stage, in, venice, with, gallo, choreographing, the, ballets, found, within, those, works, at, the, height, of, his, career, he, received, commissions, from, european, nobility, and, royalty, some, of, which, were, like, many, composers, of, the, time, vivaldi, faced, financial, difficulties, in, his, later, years, his, compositions, were, no, longer, held, in, such, high, esteem, as, they, had, once, been, in, venice, changing, musical, tastes, quickly, made, them, outmoded, in, response, vivaldi, chose, to, sell, off, sizeable, numbers, of, his, manuscripts, at, paltry, prices, to, finance, his, migration, to, vienna, the, reasons, for, vivaldi, s, departure, from, venice, are, unclear, but, it, seems, likely, that, after, the, success, of, his, meeting, with, emperor, charles, vi, he, wished, to, take, up, the, position, of, a, composer, in, the, imperial, court, on, his, way, to, vienna, vivaldi, might, have, stopped, in, graz, to, see, anna, gir, vivaldi, probably, moved, to, vienna, to, stage, operas, especially, as, he, took, up, residence, near, the, k, rntnertortheater, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, vienna, charles, vi, died, which, left, the, composer, without, any, imperial, patronage, or, a, steady, source, of, income, soon, afterwards, vivaldi, became, impoverished, and, during, the, night, of, 27, 28, july, 1741, aged, 63, he, died, of, internal, infection, in, a, house, owned, by, the, widow, of, a, viennese, saddlemaker, on, 28, july, vivald, s, funeral, took, place, at, st, stephen, s, cathedral, contrary, to, popular, legend, the, young, joseph, haydn, who, was, in, the, cathedral, choir, at, the, time, had, nothing, to, do, with, his, burial, since, no, music, was, performed, on, that, occasion, the, funeral, was, attended, by, six, pall, bearers, and, six, choir, boys, kuttenbuben, at, a, mean, cost, of, 19, florins, and, 45, kreuzer, only, a, kleingel, ut, small, peal, of, bells, the, lowest, class, was, provided, at, a, cost, of, 2, florins, and, 36, kreuzer, vivaldi, was, buried, in, a, simple, grave, in, a, burial, ground, that, was, owned, by, the, public, hospital, fund, the, b, rgerspital, gottesacker, cemetery, next, to, st, charles, church, a, baroque, church, in, an, area, that, is, now, part, of, the, site, of, the, tu, wien, university, the, cemetery, existed, until, 1807, the, house, where, he, lived, in, vienna, has, since, been, destroyed, the, hotel, sacher, is, built, on, part, of, the, site, memorial, plaques, have, been, placed, at, both, locations, as, well, as, a, vivaldi, star, in, the, viennese, musikmeile, and, a, monument, at, the, rooseveltplatz, only, two, possibly, three, original, portraits, of, vivaldi, are, known, to, survive, an, engraving, an, ink, sketch, and, an, oil, painting, the, engraving, which, was, the, basis, of, several, copies, produced, later, by, other, artists, was, made, in, 1725, by, fran, ois, morellon, de, la, cave, for, the, first, edition, of, il, cimento, dell, armonia, e, dell, inventione, and, shows, vivaldi, holding, a, sheet, of, music, the, ink, sketch, a, caricature, was, done, by, ghezzi, in, 1723, and, shows, vivaldi, s, head, and, shoulders, in, profile, it, exists, in, two, versions, a, first, jotting, kept, at, the, vatican, library, and, a, much, lesser, known, slightly, more, detailed, copy, recently, discovered, in, moscow, the, oil, painting, which, can, be, seen, in, the, international, museum, and, library, of, music, of, bologna, is, by, an, anonymous, artist, and, is, thought, to, depict, vivaldi, due, to, its, strong, resemblance, to, the, la, cave, engraving, during, his, lifetime, vivaldi, was, popular, in, many, countries, throughout, europe, including, france, but, after, his, death, his, popularity, dwindled, after, the, end, of, the, baroque, period, vivaldi, s, published, concerti, became, relatively, unknown, and, were, largely, ignored, even, his, most, famous, work, the, four, seasons, was, unknown, in, its, original, edition, during, the, classical, and, romantic, periods, vivaldi, s, work, was, rediscovered, in, the, 20th, century, a, composition, by, vivaldi, is, identified, by, rv, number, which, refers, to, its, place, in, the, ryom, verzeichnis, or, r, pertoire, des, oeuvres, d, antonio, vivaldi, a, catalog, created, in, the, 20th, century, by, the, musicologist, peter, ryom, le, quattro, stagioni, the, four, seasons, of, 1723, is, his, most, famous, work, the, first, four, of, the, 12, concertos, titled, il, cimento, dell, armonia, e, dell, inventione, the, contest, between, harmony, and, invention, they, depict, moods, and, scenes, from, each, of, the, four, seasons, this, work, has, been, described, as, an, outstanding, example, of, pre, 19th, century, program, music, vivaldi, s, other, notable, sets, of, 12, violin, concertos, include, la, stravaganza, the, eccentricity, l, estro, armonico, the, harmonic, inspiration, and, la, cetra, the, lyre, vivaldi, wrote, more, than, 500, concertos, about, 350, of, these, are, for, solo, instrument, and, strings, of, which, 230, are, for, violin, the, others, are, for, bassoon, cello, oboe, flute, viola, d, amore, recorder, lute, or, mandolin, about, forty, concertos, are, for, two, instruments, and, strings, and, about, thirty, are, for, three, or, more, instruments, and, strings, as, well, as, about, 46, operas, vivaldi, composed, a, large, body, of, sacred, choral, music, such, as, the, gloria, rv, 589, nisi, dominus, rv, 608, magnificat, rv, 610, and, stabet, mater, rv, 621, gloria, rv, 589, remains, one, of, vivaldi, s, more, popular, sacred, works, other, works, include, sinfonias, about, 90, sonatas, and, chamber, music, some, sonatas, for, flute, published, as, il, pastor, fido, have, been, erroneously, attributed, to, vivaldi, but, were, composed, by, nicolas, ch, deville, vivaldi, s, works, attracted, cataloging, efforts, befitting, a, major, composer, scholarly, work, intended, to, increase, the, accuracy, and, variety, of, vivaldi, performances, also, supported, new, discoveries, that, made, old, catalogs, incomplete, works, still, in, circulation, today, might, be, numbered, under, several, different, systems, some, earlier, catalogs, are, mentioned, here, because, the, simply, consecutive, complete, edition, ce, numbers, did, not, reflect, the, individual, works, opus, numbers, into, which, compositions, were, grouped, numbers, assigned, by, antonio, fanna, were, often, used, in, conjunction, with, ce, numbers, combined, complete, edition, ce, fanna, numbering, was, especially, common, in, the, work, of, italian, groups, driving, the, mid, 20th, century, revival, of, vivaldi, such, as, gli, accademici, di, milano, under, piero, santi, for, example, the, bassoon, concerto, in, b, major, la, notte, rv, 501, became, ce, 12, f, viii, 1, despite, the, awkwardness, of, having, to, overlay, fanna, numbers, onto, the, complete, edition, number, for, meaningful, grouping, of, vivaldi, s, oeuvre, these, numbers, displaced, the, older, pincherle, numbers, as, the, re, discovery, of, more, manuscripts, had, rendered, older, catalogs, obsolete, this, cataloging, work, was, led, by, the, istituto, italiano, antonio, vivaldi, where, gian, francesco, malipiero, was, both, the, director, and, the, editor, of, the, published, scores, edizioni, g, ricordi, his, work, built, on, that,
