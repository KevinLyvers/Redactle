to, skip, the, event, but, showed, up, when, hideko, takamine, told, him, of, one, actor, who, seemed, especially, promising, kurosawa, later, wrote, that, he, entered, the, audition, to, see, a, young, man, reeling, around, the, room, in, a, violent, frenzy, it, was, as, frightening, as, watching, a, wounded, beast, trying, to, break, loose, i, was, transfixed, when, mifune, exhausted, finished, his, scene, he, sat, down, and, gave, the, judges, an, ominous, stare, he, lost, the, competition, but, kurosawa, was, impressed, i, am, a, person, rarely, impressed, by, actors, he, later, said, but, in, the, case, of, mifune, i, was, completely, overwhelmed, mifune, immersed, himself, into, the, six, month, training, and, diligently, applied, himself, to, studying, acting, although, at, first, he, still, hoped, to, be, transferred, to, the, camera, department, his, imposing, bearing, acting, range, facility, with, foreign, languages, and, lengthy, partnership, with, acclaimed, director, akira, kurosawa, made, him, the, most, famous, japanese, actor, of, his, time, and, easily, the, best, known, to, western, audiences, he, often, portrayed, samurai, or, r, nin, who, were, usually, coarse, and, gruff, kurosawa, once, explained, that, the, only, weakness, he, could, find, with, mifune, and, his, acting, ability, was, his, rough, voice, inverting, the, popular, stereotype, of, the, genteel, clean, cut, samurai, in, such, films, as, seven, samurai, and, yojimbo, he, played, characters, who, were, often, comically, lacking, in, manners, but, replete, with, practical, wisdom, and, experience, understated, nobility, and, in, the, case, of, yojimbo, unmatched, fighting, prowess, sanjuro, in, particular, contrasts, this, earthy, warrior, spirit, with, the, useless, sheltered, propriety, of, the, court, samurai, kurosawa, valued, mifune, highly, for, his, effortless, portrayal, of, unvarnished, emotion, once, commenting, that, he, could, convey, in, only, three, feet, of, film, an, emotion, for, which, the, average, japanese, actor, would, require, ten, feet, he, starred, in, all, three, films, of, hiroshi, inagaki, s, samurai, trilogy, 1954, 1956, for, which, the, first, film, in, samurai, i, musashi, miyamoto, was, awarded, an, honorary, academy, award, mifune, and, inagaki, worked, together, on, twenty, films, which, outnumbered, his, collaborations, with, kurosawa, with, all, but, two, falling, into, the, jidaigeki, genre, most, notably, with, rickshaw, man, 1958, which, won, the, venice, film, festival, golden, lion, he, was, also, known, for, the, effort, he, put, into, his, performances, to, prepare, for, seven, samurai, and, rashomon, mifune, reportedly, studied, footage, of, lions, in, the, wild, for, the, mexican, film, nimas, trujano, he, studied, tapes, of, mexican, actors, speaking, so, that, he, could, recite, all, of, his, lines, in, spanish, many, mexicans, believed, that, toshiro, mifune, could, have, passed, for, a, native, of, oaxaca, due, to, his, critically, acclaimed, performance, when, asked, why, he, chose, mexico, to, do, his, next, film, mifune, quoted, simply, because, first, of, all, mr, ismael, rodr, guez, convinced, me, secondly, because, i, was, eager, to, work, in, beautiful, mexico, of, great, tradition, and, thirdly, because, the, story, and, character, of, animas, trujano, seemed, very, human, to, me, the, film, was, nominated, for, both, a, golden, globe, and, an, oscar, interestingly, mifune, gave, a, japanese, pistol, as, a, gift, to, then, mexican, president, adolfo, l, pez, mateos, when, they, met, in, oaxaca, mifune, has, been, credited, as, originating, the, roving, warrior, archetype, which, he, perfected, during, his, collaboration, with, kurosawa, his, martial, arts, instructor, was, yoshio, sugino, of, the, tenshin, sh, den, katori, shint, ry, sugino, created, the, fight, choreography, for, films, such, as, seven, samurai, and, yojimbo, and, kurosawa, instructed, his, actors, to, emulate, his, movements, and, bearing, clint, eastwood, was, among, the, first, of, many, actors, to, adopt, this, wandering, ronin, with, no, name, persona, for, foreign, films, which, he, used, to, great, effect, in, his, western, roles, especially, in, spaghetti, westerns, directed, by, sergio, leone, where, he, played, the, man, with, no, name, a, character, similar, to, mifune, s, seemingly, nameless, ronin, in, yojimbo, mifune, may, also, be, credited, with, originating, the, yakuza, archetype, with, his, performance, as, a, mobster, in, kurosawa, s, drunken, angel, 1948, the, first, yakuza, film, most, of, the, sixteen, kurosawa, mifune, films, are, considered, cinema, classics, these, include, drunken, angel, stray, dog, rashomon, seven, samurai, the, hidden, fortress, high, and, low, throne, of, blood, an, adaptation, of, shakespeare, s, macbeth, yojimbo, and, sanjuro, mifune, and, kurosawa, finally, parted, ways, after, red, beard, several, factors, contributed, to, the, rift, that, ended, this, career, spanning, collaboration, mifune, had, a, passion, for, film, in, his, own, right, and, had, long, wanted, to, set, up, a, production, company, working, towards, going, freelance, kurosawa, and, taniguchi, advised, against, it, out, of, concern, they, would, not, be, able, to, cast, mifune, as, freely, most, of, mifune, s, contemporaries, acted, in, several, different, movies, in, this, period, since, red, beard, required, mifune, to, grow, a, natural, beard, one, he, had, to, keep, for, the, entirety, of, the, film, s, two, years, of, shooting, he, was, unable, to, act, in, any, other, films, during, the, production, this, put, mifune, and, his, financially, strapped, production, company, deeply, into, debt, creating, friction, between, him, and, kurosawa, although, red, beard, played, to, packed, houses, in, japan, and, europe, which, helped, mifune, recoup, some, of, his, losses, the, ensuing, years, held, varying, outcomes, for, both, mifune, and, kurosawa, after, the, film, s, release, the, careers, of, each, man, took, different, arcs, mifune, continued, to, enjoy, success, with, a, range, of, samurai, and, war, themed, films, rebellion, samurai, assassin, the, emperor, and, a, general, among, others, in, contrast, kurosawa, s, output, of, films, dwindled, and, drew, mixed, responses, during, this, time, kurosawa, attempted, suicide, in, 1980, mifune, experienced, popularity, with, mainstream, american, audiences, through, his, role, as, lord, toranaga, in, the, television, miniseries, shogun, which, kurosawa, criticised, for, its, historical, inaccuracy, mifune, spoke, respectfully, of, kurosawa, and, loyally, attended, the, premiere, of, kagemusha, mifune, turned, down, an, opportunity, from, united, artists, to, play, the, japanese, spy, chief, tiger, tanaka, in, the, james, bond, film, you, only, live, twice, 1967, according, to, his, daughter, he, also, turned, down, an, offer, from, george, lucas, to, play, either, darth, vader, or, obi, wan, kenobi, in, star, wars, 1977, mifune, himself, was, always, professional, memorizing, all, of, his, lines, and, not, carrying, scripts, on, set, he, was, unusually, humble, for, an, international, star, and, was, known, for, treating, his, co, stars, and, crew, very, generously, throwing, lavish, catered, parties, for, them, and, paying, for, their, families, to, go, to, onsen, resorts, when, american, actor, scott, glenn, was, asked, about, his, experience, of, filming, the, challenge, 1982, alongside, mifune, glenn, recalled, disappointment, that, the, original, script, about, a, surrogate, father, and, son, finding, each, other, from, completely, different, cultures, lost, its, character, driven, scenes, and, was, reduced, to, a, martial, arts, movie, but, stated, i, remember, mifune, came, to, me, and, he, said, look, this, is, what, s, happening, i, m, disappointed, and, i, know, you, are, but, this, is, what, it, is, so, you, can, either, have, your, heart, broken, every, day, or, you, can, use, this, experience, as, an, opportunity, to, be, spending, time, in, the, most, interesting, time, in, japan, and, let, me, be, your, tour, guide, so, it, wound, up, with, me, learning, an, awful, lot, of, stuff, from, toshir, in, 1979, mifune, joined, the, ensemble, cast, of, the, steven, spielberg, war, comedy, 1941, as, the, commander, of, a, lost, imperial, japanese, navy, submarine, searching, for, hollywood, shortly, after, the, pearl, harbor, attack, mifune, received, wide, acclaim, in, the, west, after, playing, toranaga, in, the, 1980, tv, miniseries, shogun, however, the, series, blunt, portrayal, of, the, tokugawa, shogunate, and, the, greatly, abridged, version, shown, in, japan, meant, that, it, was, not, as, well, received, in, his, homeland, the, relationship, between, kurosawa, and, mifune, remained, ambivalent, kurosawa, criticized, mifune, s, acting, in, interview, magazine, and, also, said, that, all, the, films, that, i, made, with, mifune, without, him, they, would, not, exist, he, also, presented, mifune, with, the, kawashita, award, which, he, himself, had, won, two, years, prior, they, frequently, encountered, each, other, professionally, and, met, again, in, 1993, at, the, funeral, of, their, friend, ishir, honda, but, never, collaborated, again, among, mifune, s, fellow, performers, one, of, the, 32, women, chosen, during, the, new, faces, contest, was, sachiko, yoshimine, eight, years, mifune, s, junior, she, came, from, a, respected, tokyo, family, they, fell, in, love, and, mifune, soon, proposed, marriage, director, senkichi, taniguchi, with, the, help, of, akira, kurosawa, convinced, the, yoshimine, family, to, allow, the, marriage, the, wedding, took, place, in, february, 1950, at, the, aoyama, gakuin, methodist, church, yoshimine, was, a, buddhist, but, since, mifune, was, a,

for, by, his, estranged, wife, sachiko, when, she, died, from, pancreatic, cancer, in, 1995, mifune, s, physical, and, mental, state, declined, rapidly, on, december, 24, 1997, he, died, in, mitaka,

of, akira, kurosawa, toshiro, mifune, said, i, have, never, as, an, actor, done, anything, that, i, am, proud, of, other, than, with, him, mifune, had, a, kind, of, talent, i, had, never, encountered, before, in, the, japanese, film, world, it, was, above, all, the, speed, with, which, he, expressed, himself, that, was, astounding, the, ordinary, japanese, actor, might, need, ten, feet, of, film, to, get, across, an, impression, mifune, needed, only, three, the, speed, of, his, movements, was, such, that, he, said, in, a, single, action, what, took, ordinary, actors, three, separate, movements, to, express, he, put, forth, everything, directly, and, boldly, and, his, sense, of, timing, was, the, keenest, i, had, ever, seen, in, a, japanese, actor, and, yet, with, all, his, quickness, he, also, had, surprisingly, fine, sensibilities, since, i, came, into, the, industry, very, inexperienced, i, don, t, have, any, theory, of, acting, i, just, had, to, play, my, roles, my, way, generally, speaking, most, east, west, stories, have, been, a, series, of, cliches, i, for, one, have, no, desire, to, retell, madame, butterfly, an, actor, is, not, a, puppet, with, strings, pulled, by, the, director, he, is, a, human, being, with, seeds, of, all, emotions, desires, and, needs, within, himself, i, attempt, to, find, the, very, center, of, this, humanity, and, explore, and, experiment, of, toshiro, mifune, in, his, 1991, book, cult, movie, stars, danny, peary, wrote, vastly, talented, charismatic, and, imposing, because, of, his, strong, voice, and, physique, the, star, of, most, of, akira, kurosawa, s, classics, became, the, first, japanese, actor, since, sessue, hayakawa, to, have, international, fame, but, where, hayakawa, became, a, sex, symbol, because, he, was, romantic, exotic, and, suavely, charming, even, when, playing, lecherous, villains, mifune, s, sex, appeal, and, appeal, to, male, viewers, was, due, to, his, sheer, unrefined, and, uninhibited, masculinity, he, was, attractive, even, when, he, was, unshaven, and, unwashed, drunk, wide, eyed, and, openly, scratching, himself, all, over, his, sweaty, body, as, if, he, were, a, flea, infested, dog, he, did, indeed, have, animal, magnetism, in, fact, he, based, his, wild, growling, scratching, superhyper, samurai, recruit, in, the, seven, samurai, on, a, lion, it, shouldn, t, be, forgotten, that, mifune, was, terrific, in, kurosawa, s, contemporary, social, dramas, as, detectives, or, doctors, wearing, suits, and, ties, but, he, will, always, be, remembered, for, his, violent, and, fearless, funny, morally, ambivalent, samurai, heroes, for, kurosawa, as, well, as, in, hiroshi, inagaki, s, classic, epic, the, samurai, trilogy, peary, also, wrote, amazingly, physical, was, a, supreme, action, hero, whose, bloody, ritualistic, and, ironically, sometimes, comical, sword, fight, sequences, in, yojimbo, and, sanjuro, are, classics, as, well, choreographed, as, the, greatest, movie, dances, his, nameless, sword, for, hire, anticipated, clint, eastwood, s, man, with, no, name, gunfighter, with, his, intelligence, eyes, seemingly, in, back, of, his, head, and, experience, evident, in, every, thrust, or, slice, he, has, no, trouble, and, no, pity, dispatching, twenty, opponents, at, a, time, bruce, lee, must, have, been, watching, it, is, a, testament, to, his, skills, as, an, actor, that, watching, the, incredible, swordplay, does, not, thrill, us, any, more, than, watching, his, face, during, the, battle, or, just, the, way, he, moves, without, a, trace, of, panic, across, the, screen, for, no, one, walks, or, races, with, more, authority, arrogance, or, grace, than, mifune, s, barefoot, warriors, for, a, 20, year, period, there, was, no, greater, actor, dynamic, or, action, than, toshiro, mifune, just, look, at, his, credits, in, an, article, published, in, 2020, by, the, criterion, collection, in, commemoration, of, mifune, s, centenary, of, birth, moeko, fujii, wrote, for, most, of, the, past, century, when, people, thought, of, a, japanese, man, they, saw, toshiro, mifune, a, samurai, in, the, world, s, eyes, has, mifune,

yawned, scratched, chortled, and, lazed, but, when, he, extended, his, right, arm, quick, and, low, with, a, blade, he, somehow, summoned, the, tone, of, epics, there, s, a, tendency, to, make, mifune, sound, mythical, the, leading, man, of, kurosawa, gumi, the, emperor, s, coterie, he, would, cement, his, superstar, status, in, over, 150, films, in, his, lifetime, acting, for, other, famed, directors, hiroshi, inagaki, kajiro, yamamoto, kihachi, okamoto, in, roles, ranging, from, a, caped, lover, to, a, mexican, bandit, mifune, s, life, on, screen, centers, solely, around, men, women, when, they, do, appear, feel, arbitrary, mythical, temporary, it, s, clear, that, no, one, is, really, invested, in, the, thrums, of, heterosexual, desire, toshiro, mifune, cemented, his, reputation, as, an, icon, of, masculinity, right, alongside, hollywood, narratives, of, neutered, asian, manhood, in, 1961, mifune, provoked, worldwide, longing, by, swaggering, around, in, yojimbo, the, same,

often, christened, the, first, hollywood, sex, symbol, with, his, long, slim, fingers, and, yves, saint, laurent, polish, but, mifune, represents, a, development, beyond, hayakawa, s, japanese, man, on, screen, who, despite, his, huge, white, female, fanbase, was, always, limited, to, roles, of, the, oriental, villain, the, menace, the, impossible, romantic, lead, in, 1957, joe, franklin, would, tell, hayakawa, in, his, talk, show, there, were, two, things, we, were, sure, of, in, the, silent, movie, era, the, indians, never, got, the, best, of, it, and, sessue, hayakawa, never, got, the, girl, mifune, never, wants, the, girl, in, the, first, place, so, the, men, around, him, can, t, help, but, watch, him, a, little, open, mouthed, as, he, walks, his, slice, of, world, amused, by, and, nonchalant, about, the, stupor, he, leaves, in, his, wake, who, is, he, someone, asks, and, no, one, ever, has, a, good, answer, you, can, t, help, but, want, to, walk, alongside, him, to, figure, it,
