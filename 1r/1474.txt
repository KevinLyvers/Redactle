ultimately, he, did, not, pursue, this, vocation, as, late, as, 1906, when, he, was, 24, years, old, he, approached, the, president, of, clonliffe, seminary, in, dublin, for, advice, on, his, vocation, de, valera, was, throughout, his, life, portrayed, as, a, deeply, religious, man, and, in, death, asked, to, be, buried, in, a, religious, habit, his, biographer, tim, pat, coogan, speculated, that, questions, surrounding, de, valera, s, legitimacy, may, have, been, a, deciding, factor, in, his, not, entering, religious, life, being, illegitimate, would, have, ordinarily, been, a, bar, to, receiving, priestly, orders, as, a, secular, priest, but, not, to, becoming, a, priest, or, religious, in, some, religious, orders, as, a, young, gaeilgeoir, irish, speaker, de, valera,

involved, in, the, gaelic, revival, de, valera, s, involvement, in, the, political, revolution, began, on, 25, november, 1913, when, he, joined, the, irish, volunteers, the, organisation, was, formed, to, oppose, the, ulster, volunteers, and, ensure, the, enactment, of, the, irish, parliamentary, party, s, third, home, rule, act, won, by, its, leader, john, redmond, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, august, 1914, de, valera, rose, through, the, ranks, and, it, was, not, long, before, he, was, elected, captain, of, the, donnybrook, branch, preparations, were, pushed, ahead, for, an, armed, revolt, and, he, was, made, commandant, of, the, third, battalion, and, adjutant, of, the, dublin, brigade, he, took, part, in, the, howth, gun, running, he, was, sworn, by, thomas, macdonagh, into, the, oath, bound, irish, republican, brotherhood, which, secretly, controlled, the, central, executive, of, the, volunteers, he, opposed, secret, societies, but, this, was, the, only, way, he, could, be, guaranteed, full, information, on, plans, for, the, rising, 32, on, 24, april, 1916, the, easter, rising, began, forces, commanded, by, de, valera, occupied, boland, s, mill, on, grand,

valera, was, court, martialled, convicted, and, sentenced, to, death, but, the, sentence, was, immediately, commuted, to, penal, servitude, for, life, de, valera, was, among, the, few, republican, leaders, the, british, did, not, execute, it, has, been, argued, that, his, life, was, saved, by, four, facts, first, he, was, one, of, the, last, to, surrender, and, he, was, held, in, a, different, prison, from, other, leaders, thus, his, execution, was, delayed, by, practicalities, second, the, us, consulate, in, dublin, made, representations, before, his, trial, i, e, was, he, actually, a, united, states, citizen, and, if, so, how, would, the, united, states, react, to, the, execution, of, one, of, its, citizens, while, the, full, legal, situation, was, clarified, the, uk, was, trying, to, bring, the, us, into, the, war, in, europe, at, the, time, and, the, irish, american, vote, was, important, in, us, politics, third, when, lt, gen, sir, john, maxwell, reviewed, his, case, he, said, who, is, he, i, haven, t, heard, of, him, before, i, wonder, would, he, be, likely, to, make, trouble, in, the, future, on, being, told, that, de, valera, was, unimportant, he, commuted, the, court, martial, s, death, sentence, to, life, imprisonment, 93, de, valera, had, no, fenian, family, or, personal, background, and, his, mi5, file, in, 1916, was, very, slim, detailing, only, his, open, membership, in, the, irish, volunteers, 92, fourth, by, the, time, de, valera, was, court, martialled, on, 8, may, political, pressure, was, being, brought, to, bear, on, maxwell, to, halt, the, executions, maxwell, had, already, told, british, prime, minister, h, h, asquith, that, only, two, more, were, to, be, executed, se, n, mac, diarmada, and, james, connolly, although, they, were, court, martialled, the, day, after, de, valera, his, late, trial, representations, made, by, the, american, consulate, his, lack, of, fenian, background, and, political, pressure, all, combined, to, save, his, life, though, had, he, been, tried, a, week, earlier, he, would, probably, have, been, shot, 91, 94, de, valera, s, supporters, and, detractors, argue, about, his, bravery, during, the, easter, rising, his, supporters, claim, he, showed, leadership, skills, and, a, capacity, for, meticulous, planning, his, detractors, claim, he, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, during, the, rising, according, to, accounts, from, 1916, de, valera, was, seen, running, about, giving, conflicting, orders, refusing, to, sleep, and, on, one, occasion, having, forgotten, the, password, almost, getting, himself, shot, in, the, dark, by, his, own, men, according, to, one, account, de, valera, on, being, forced, to, sleep, by, one, subordinate, who, promised, to, sit, beside, him, and, wake, him, if, he, was, needed, suddenly, woke, up, his, eyes, wild, screaming, set, fire, to, the, railway, set, fire, to, the, railway, later, in, the, ballykinlar, internment, camp, one, de, valera, loyalist, approached, another, internee, a, medical, doctor, recounted, the, story, and, asked, for, a, medical, opinion, as, to, de, valera, s, condition, he, also, threatened, to, sue, the, doctor, future, fine, gael, td, and, minister, dr, tom, o, higgins, if, he, ever, repeated, the, story, the, british, reportedly, however, considered, de, valera, s, forces, the, best, trained, and, best, led, among, the, rebels, de, valera, s, latest, biographer, anthony, j, jordan, writes, of, this, controversy, whatever, happened, in, boland, s, mills, or, any, other, garrison, does, not, negate, or, undermine, in, any, way, the, extraordinary, heroism, of, dev, and, his, comrades, 37, after, imprisonment, in, dartmoor, maidstone, and, lewes, prisons, de, valera, and, his, comrades, were, released, under, an, amnesty, in, june, 1917, on, 10, july, 1917, he, was, elected, as, the, member, of, parliament, mp, for, east, clare, the, constituency, which, he, represented, until, 1959, in, a, by, election, caused, by, the, death, of, the, previous, incumbent, willie, redmond, brother, of, the, irish, party, leader, john, redmond, who, had, died, fighting, in, world, war, i, in, the, 1918, general, election, he, was, elected, both, for, that, seat, and, mayo, east, as, an, abstentionist, de, valera, would, not, have, gone, to, westminster, but, was, not, able, to, do, so, regardless, because, in, early, 1918, he, was, again, arrested, because, most, other, irish, rebellion, leaders, were, dead, in, 1917, de, valera, had, been, elected, president, of, sinn, f, in, the, party, which, had, been, blamed, incorrectly, for, provoking, the, easter, rising, this, party, became, the, political, vehicle, through, which, the, survivors, of, the, easter, rising, channelled, their, republican, ethos, and, objectives, the, previous, president, of, sinn, f, in, arthur, griffith, had, championed, an, anglo, irish, dual, monarchy, based, on, the, austro, hungarian, model, with, independent, legislatures, for, both, ireland, and, britain, sinn, f, in, won, a, huge, majority, in, the, 1918, general, election, largely, thanks, to, the, british, executions, of, the, 1916, leaders, the, threat, of, conscription, with, the, conscription, crisis, of, 1918, and, the, first, past, the, post, ballot, they, won, 73, out, of, 105, irish, seats, with, about, 47, of, votes, cast, 25, seats, were, uncontested, on, 21, january, 1919, 27, sinn, f, in, mps, the, rest, were, imprisoned, or, impaired, calling, themselves, teachta, d, la, tds, assembled, in, the, mansion, house, in, dublin, and, formed, an, irish, parliament, known, as, d, il, ireann, translatable, into, english, as, the, assembly, of, ireland, the, ministry, of, d, il, ireann, was, formed, under, the, leadership, of, the, pr, omh, aire, also, called, president, of, d, il, ireann, cathal, brugha, de, valera, had, been, re, arrested, in, may, 1918, and, imprisoned, and, so, could, not, attend, the, january, session, of, the, d, il, he, escaped, from, lincoln, gaol, england, in, february, 1919, as, a, result, he, replaced, brugha, as, pr, omh, aire, in, the, april, session, of, d, il, ireann, in, the, hope, of, securing, international, recognition, se, n, t, o, kelly, was, sent, as, an, envoy, to, paris, to, present, the, irish, case, to, the, peace, conference, convened, by, the, great, powers, at, the, end, of, world, war, i, when, it, became, clear, by, may, 1919, that, this, mission, could, not, succeed, de, valera, decided, to, visit, the, united, states, the, mission, had, three, objectives, to, ask, for, official, recognition, of, the, irish, republic, to, float, a, loan, to, finance, the, work, of, the, government, and, by, extension, the, irish, republican, army, and, to, secure, the, support, of, the, american, people, for, the, republic, his, visit, lasted, from, june, 1919, to, december, 1920, and, had, mixed, success, including, a, visit, to, fenway, park, in, boston, in, front, of, 50, 000, supporters, one, negative, outcome, was, the, splitting, of, the, irish, american, organisations, into, pro, and, anti, de, valera, factions, 63, 70, he, met, the, young, harvard, educated, leader, from, puerto, rico, pedro, albizu, campos, and, forged, a, lasting, and, useful, alliance, with, him, it, was, during, this, american, tour, that, he, recruited, his, long, serving, personal, secretary, kathleen, o, connell, an, irish, emigrant, who, would, return, to, ireland, with, him, in, october, 1919, he, visited, the, university, of, notre, dame, campus, in, indiana, where, he, planted, a, tree, and, also, laid, a, wreath, by, the, statue, of, william, corby, he, toured, the, university, archives, and, spoke, in, washington, hall, about, the, cause, of, ireland, in, front, of, twelve, hundred, students, de, valera, managed, to, raise, 5, 500, 000, from, american, supporters, an, amount, that, far, exceeded, the, hopes, of, the, d, il, of, this, 500, 000, was, devoted, to, the, american, presidential, campaign, in, 1920, helping, him, gain, wider, public, support, there, in, 1921, it, was, said, that, 1, 466, 000, had, already, been, spent, and, it, is, unclear, when, the, net, balance, arrived, in, ireland, recognition, was, not, forthcoming, in, the, international, sphere, he, also, had, difficulties, with, various, irish, american, leaders, such, as, john, devoy, and, judge, daniel, f, cohalan, who, resented, the, dominant, position, he, established, preferring, to, retain, their, control, over, irish, affairs, in, the, united, states, while, american, recognition, for, the, republic, had, been, his, priority, in, february, 1921, de, valera, redirected, patrick, mccartan, from, washington, to, moscow, mccartan, was, told, by, maxim, litvinov, that, the, opportunity, of, recognition, and, assistance, had, passed, the, soviet, priority, was, a, trade, agreement, with, britain, signed, in, march, in, june, the, british, government, with, a, view, to, both, domestic, and, american, opinion, published, the, proposed, treaty, between, the, d, il, government, and, the, soviets, and, related, correspondence, meanwhile, in, ireland, the, conflict, between, the, british, authorities, and, the, d, il, which, the, british, declared, illegal, in, september, 1919, escalated, into, the, irish, war, of, independence, de, valera, left, day, to, day, government, during, his, eighteen, month, absence, in, the, united, states, to, michael, collins, his, 29, year, old, minister, for, finance, de, valera, and, collins, would, later, become, opponents, during, the, irish, civil, war, in, january, 1921, in, his, first, appearance, in, the, d, il, after, his, return, to, a, country, gripped, by, the, war, of, independence, de, valera, introduced, a, motion, calling, on, the, ira, to, desist, from, ambushes, and, other, tactics, that, were, allowing, the, british, to, successfully, portray, it, as, a, terrorist, group, and, to, take, on, the, british, forces, with, conventional, military, methods, this, they, strongly, opposed, and, de, valera, relented, issuing, a, statement, expressing, support, for, the, ira, and, claiming, it, was, fully, under, the, control, of, the, d, il, he, then, along, with, cathal, brugha, and, austin, stack, brought, pressure, to, bear, on, michael, collins, to, undertake, a, journey, to, the, united, states, himself, on, the, pretext, that, only, he, could, take, up, where, de, valera, had, left, off, collins, successfully, resisted, this, move, and, stayed, in, ireland, in, the, elections, of, may, 1921, all, candidates, in, southern, ireland, were, returned, unopposed, and, sinn, f, in, secured, some, seats, in, northern, ireland, following, the, truce, of, july, 1921, that, ended, the, war, de, valera, went, to, see, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, in, london, on, 14, july, no, agreement, was, reached, and, by, then, the, parliament, of, northern, ireland, had, already, met, it, became, clear, that, neither, a, republic, nor, independence, for, all, 32, counties, was, going, to, be, offered, lloyd, george, told, de, valera, he, could, put, a, soldier, in, ireland, for, every, man, woman, and, child, in, it, if, the, ira, did, not, immediately, agree, to, stop, fighting, in, august, 1921, de, valera, secured, d, il, ireann, s, approval, to, change, the, 1919, d, il, constitution, to, upgrade, his, office, from, prime, minister, or, chairman, of, the, cabinet, to, a, full, president, of, the, republic, declaring, himself, now, the, irish, equivalent, of, king, george, v, he, argued, that, as, irish, head, of, state, in, the, absence, of, the, british, head, of, state, from, the, negotiations, he, too, should, not, attend, the, peace, conference, called, the, treaty, negotiations, october, december, 1921, at, which, british, and, irish, government, leaders, agreed, to, the, effective, independence, of, twenty, six, of, ireland, s, thirty, two, counties, as, the, irish, free, state, with, northern, ireland, choosing, to, remain, under, british, sovereignty, it, is, generally, agreed, by, historians, that, whatever, his, motives, it, was, a, mistake, for, de, valera, not, to, have, travelled, to, london, 91, having, effected, these, changes, a, boundary, commission, came, into, place, to, redraw, the, irish, border, nationalists, expected, its, report, to, recommend, that, largely, nationalist, areas, become, part, of, the, free, state, and, many, hoped, this, would, make, northern, ireland, so, small, it, would, not, be, economically, viable, a, council, of, ireland, was, also, provided, in, the, treaty, as, a, model, for, an, eventual, all, irish, parliament, hence, neither, the, pro, nor, anti, treaty, sides, made, many, complaints, about, partition, in, the, treaty, debates, the, republic, s, delegates, to, the, treaty, negotiations, were, accredited, by, de, valera, and, his, cabinet, as, plenipotentiaries, that, is, negotiators, with, the, legal, authority, to, sign, a, treaty, without, reference, back, to, the, cabinet, but, were, given, secret, cabinet, instructions, by, de, valera, that, required, them, to, return, to, dublin, before, signing, the, treaty, the, treaty, proved, controversial, in, ireland, insofar, as, it, replaced, the, republic, by, a, dominion, of, the, british, commonwealth, with, the, king, represented, by, a, governor, general, of, the, irish, free, state, the, irish, delegates, arthur, griffith, robert, barton, and, michael, collins, supported, by, erskine, childers, as, secretary, general, set, up, their, delegation, headquarters, at, 22, hans, place, in, knightsbridge, it, was, there, at, 11, 15, am, on, 5, december, 1921, that, the, decision, was, made, to, recommend, the, treaty, to, d, il, ireann, the, treaty, was, finally, signed, by, the, delegates, after, further, negotiations, which, closed, at, 02, 20, on, 6, december, 1921, de, valera, baulked, at, the, agreement, his, opponents, claimed, that, he, had, refused, to, join, the, negotiations, because, he, knew, what, the, outcome, would, be, and, did, not, wish, to, receive, the, blame, de, valera, claimed, that, he, had, not, gone, to, the, treaty, negotiations, because, he, would, be, better, able, to, control, the, extremists, at, home, and, that, his, absence, would, allow, leverage, for, the, plenipotentiaries, to, refer, back, to, him, and, not, be, pressured, into, any, agreements, because, of, the, secret, instructions, given, to, the, plenipotentiaries, he, reacted, to, news, of, the, signing, of, the, treaty, not, with, anger, at, its, contents, which, he, refused, even, to, read, when, offered, a, newspaper, report, of, its, contents, but, with, anger, over, the, fact, that, they, had, not, consulted, him, their, president, before, signing, his, ideal, drafts, presented, to, a, secret, session, of, the, d, il, during, the, treaty, debates, and, publicised, in, january, 1922, were, ingenious, compromises, but, they, included, dominion, status, the, treaty, ports, the, fact, of, partition, subject, to, veto, by, the, parliament, in, belfast, and, some, continuing, status, for, the, king, as, head, of, the, commonwealth, ireland, s, share, of, the, imperial, debt, was, to, be, paid, after, the, treaty, was, narrowly, ratified, by, 64, to, 57, de, valera, and, a, large, minority, of, sinn, f, in, tds, left, d, il, ireann, he, then, resigned, and, arthur, griffith, was, elected, president, of, d, il, ireann, in, his, place, though, respectfully, still, calling, him, the, president, on, a, speaking, tour, of, the, more, republican, province, of, munster, starting, on, 17, march, 1922, de, valera, made, controversial, speeches, at, carrick, on, suir, lismore, dungarvan, and, waterford, saying, that, if, the, treaty, were, accepted, the, fight, for, freedom, would, still, go, on, and, the, irish, people, instead, of, fighting, foreign, soldiers, will, have, to, fight, the, irish, soldiers, of, an, irish, government, set, up, by, irishmen, at, thurles, several, days, later, he, repeated, this, imagery, and, added, that, the, ira, would, have, to, wade, through, the, blood, of, the, soldiers, of, the, irish, government, and, perhaps, through, that, of, some, members, of, the, irish, government, to, get, their, freedom, in, a, letter, to, the, irish, independent, on, 23, march, de, valera, accepted, the, accuracy, of, their, report, of, his, comment, about, wading, through, blood, but, deplored, that, the, newspaper, had, published, it, de, valera, objected, to, the, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, king, that, the, treaty, required, irish, parliamentarians, to, take, he, also, was, concerned, that, ireland, could, not, have, an, independent, foreign, policy, as, part, of, the, british, commonwealth, when, the, british, retained, several, naval, ports, see, treaty, ports, around, ireland, s, coast, as, a, compromise, de, valera, proposed, external, association, with, the, british, empire, which, would, leave, ireland, s, foreign, policy, in, her, own, hands, and, a, republican, constitution, with, no, mention, of, the, british, monarch, he, proposed, this, as, early, as, april, well, before, the, negotiations, began, under, the, title, document, no, 2, michael, collins, was, prepared, to, accept, this, formula, and, the, two, wings, pro, and, anti, treaty, of, sinn, f, in, formed, a, pact, to, fight, the, 1922, irish, general, election, together, and, form, a, coalition, government, afterwards, collins, later, called, off, the, pact, on, the, eve, of, the, election, de, valera, s, opponents, won, the, election, and, civil, war, broke, out, shortly, afterwards, in, late, june, 1922, relations, between, the, new, irish, government, which, was, backed, by, most, of, the, d, il, and, the, electorate, and, the, anti, treatyites, under, the, nominal, leadership, of, de, valera, now, descended, into, the, irish, civil, war, june, 1922, to, may, 1923, in, which, the, pro, treaty, free, state, forces, defeated, the, anti, treaty, ira, both, sides, had, wanted, to, avoid, civil, war, but, fighting, broke, out, over, the, takeover, of, the, four, courts, in, dublin, by, anti, treaty, members, of, the, ira, these, men, were, not, loyal, to, de, valera, and, initially, were, not, even, supported, by, the, executive, of, the, anti, treaty, ira, however, michael, collins, was, forced, to, act, against, them, when, winston, churchill, threatened, to, re, occupy, the, country, with, british, troops, unless, action, was, taken, when, fighting, broke, out, in, dublin, between, the, four, courts, garrison, and, the, new, free, state, army, republicans, backed, the, ira, men, in, the, four, courts, and, civil, war, broke, out, de, valera, though, he, held, no, military, position, backed, the, anti, treaty, ira, or, irregulars, and, said, that, he, was, re, enlisting, in, the, ira, as, an, ordinary, volunteer, on, 8, september, 1922, he, met, in, secret, with, richard, mulcahy, in, dublin, to, try, to, halt, the, fighting, however, according, to, de, valera, they, could, not, find, a, basis, for, agreement, though, nominally, head, of, the, anti, treatyites, de, valera, had, little, influence, he, does, not, seem, to, have, been, involved, in, any, fighting, and, had, little, or, no, influence, with, the, revolutionary, military, leadership, headed, by, ira, chief, of, staff, liam, lynch, de, valera, and, the, anti, treaty, tds, formed, a, republican, government, on, 25, october, 1922, from, anti, treaty, tds, to, be, temporarily, the, supreme, executive, of, the, republic, and, the, state, until, such, time, as, the, elected, parliament, of, the, republic, can, freely, assemble, or, the, people, being, rid, of, external, aggression, are, at, liberty, to, decide, freely, how, they, are, to, be, governed, however, it, had, no, real, authority, and, was, a, pale, shadow, of, the, d, il, government, of, 1919, 21, in, march, 1923, de, valera, attended, the, meeting, of, the, ira, army, executive, to, decide, on, the, future, of, the, war, he, was, known, to, be, in, favour, of, a, truce, but, he, had, no, voting, rights, and, it, was, narrowly, decided, to, continue, hostilities, 131, the, leader, of, the, free, state, w, t, cosgrave, insisted, that, there, could, be, no, acceptance, of, a, surrender, without, disarming, on, 30, april, 1923, the, ira, s, new, chief, of, staff, frank, aiken, lynch, had, been, killed, called, a, ceasefire, this, was, followed, on, 24, may, by, an, order, for, volunteers, to, dump, arms, de, valera, who, had, wanted, an, end, to, the, internecine, fighting, for, some, time, backed, the, ceasefire, order, with, a, message, in, which, he, called, the, anti, treaty, fighters, the, legion, of, the, rearguard, saying, that, the, republic, can, no, longer, be, successfully, defended, by, your, arms, further, sacrifice, on, your, part, would, now, be, in, vain, and, the, continuance, of, the, struggle, in, arms, unwise, in, the, national, interest, and, prejudicial, to, the, future, of, our, cause, military, victory, must, be, allowed, to, rest, for, the, moment, with, those, who, have, destroyed, the, republic, other, means, must, be, sought, to, safeguard, the, nation, s, right, after, this, point, many, of, the, republicans, were, arrested, in, free, state, round, ups, when, they, had, come, out, of, hiding, and, returned, home, de, valera, remained, in, hiding, for, several, months, after, the, ceasefire, was, declared, however, he, emerged, in, august, to, stand, for, election, in, county, clare, making, a, campaign, appearance, in, ennis, on, 15, august, de, valera, was, arrested, on, the, platform, and, interned, at, kilmainham, jail, he, was, moved, to, arbour, hill, barracks, briefly, prior, to, his, release, on, 16, july, 1924, after, the, ira, dumped, their, arms, rather, than, surrender, them, or, continue, a, now, fruitless, war, de, valera, returned, to, political, methods, in, 1924, he, was, arrested, in, newry, for, illegally, entering, northern, ireland, and, held, in, solitary, confinement, for, a, month, in, crumlin, road, gaol, belfast, during, this, time, de, valera, came, to, believe, that, abstentionism, was, not, a, workable, tactic, in, the, long, term, he, now, believed, that, a, better, course, would, be, to, try, to, gain, power, and, turn, the, free, state, from, a, constitutional, monarchy, into, a, republic, he, tried, to, convince, sinn, f, in, to, accept, this, new, line, however, a, vote, to, accept, the, free, state, constitution, contingent, on, the, abolition, of, the, oath, of, allegiance, narrowly, failed, soon, afterwards, de, valera, resigned, from, sinn, f, in, and, seriously, considered, leaving, politics, however, one, of, his, colleagues, se, n, lemass, convinced, de, valera, to, found, a, new, republican, party, in, march, 1926, with, lemass, constance, markievicz, and, others, de, valera, formed, a, new, party, fianna, f, il, the, warriors, of, destiny, a, party, that, was, to, dominate, 20th, century, irish, politics, while, sinn, f, in, still, held, to, an, abstentionist, line, fianna, f, il, was, dedicated, to, republicanising, the, free, state, from, within, if, it, gained, power, having, attracted, most, of, sinn, f, in, s, branches, due, to, lemass, organisational, skill, the, new, party, made, swift, electoral, gains, in, the, general, election, on, 9, june, 1927, in, the, process, it, took, much, of, sinn, f, in, s, previous, support, winning, 44, seats, to, sinn, f, in, s, five, it, refused, to, take, the, oath, of, allegiance, portrayed, by, opponents, as, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, crown, but, actually, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, irish, free, state, with, a, secondary, promise, of, fidelity, to, the, king, in, his, role, in, the, treaty, settlement, the, oath, was, largely, the, work, of, collins, and, based, on, three, sources, british, oaths, in, the, dominions, the, oath, of, the, irish, republican, brotherhood, and, a, draft, oath, prepared, by, de, valera, in, his, proposed, treaty, alternative, document, no, 2, de, valera, began, a, legal, case, to, challenge, the, requirement, that, members, of, his, party, take, the, oath, but, the, assassination, of, the, vice, president, of, the, executive, council, deputy, prime, minister, kevin, o, higgins, on, 10, july, 1927, led, the, executive, council, under, w, t, cosgrave, to, introduce, a, bill, on, 20, july, requiring, all, d, il, candidates, to, promise, on, oath, that, if, they, were, elected, they, would, take, the, oath, of, allegiance, forced, into, a, corner, and, faced, with, the, option, of, staying, outside, politics, forever, or, taking, the, oath, and, entering, de, valera, and, his, tds, took, the, oath, of, allegiance, on, 12, august, 1927, though, de, valera, himself, described, the, oath, as, an, empty, political, formula, de, valera, never, organised, fianna, f, il, in, northern, ireland, and, it, was, not, until, 7, december, 2007, that, fianna, f, il, was, registered, there, by, the, uk, electoral, commission, in, the, 1932, general, election, fianna, f, il, secured, 72, seats, and, became, the, largest, party, in, the, d, il, although, without, a, majority, some, fianna, f, il, members, arrived, at, the, first, sitting, of, the, new, d, il, carrying, arms, amid, fears, that, cumann, na, ngaedheal, would, not, voluntarily, surrender, power, however, the, transition, was, peaceful, de, valera, was, elected, president, of, the, executive, council, prime, minister, by, the, d, il, by, a, vote, of, 81, 68, with, the, support, of, the, labour, party, and, independent, politicians, and, took, office, on, 9, march, he, at, once, initiated, steps, to, fulfil, his, election, promises, to, abolish, the, oath, and, withhold, land, annuities, owed, to, the, uk, for, loans, provided, under, the, irish, land, acts, and, agreed, as, part, of, the, 1921, treaty, this, launched, the, anglo, irish, trade, war, when, the, uk, in, retaliation, imposed, economic, sanctions, against, irish, exports, de, valera, responded, in, kind, with, levies, on, british, imports, the, ensuing, economic, war, lasted, until, 1938, after, de, valera, had, urged, king, george, v, to, dismiss, mcneill, as, governor, general, the, king, suggested, an, alternative, course, of, action, that, mcneill, instead, carry, on, a, while, longer, as, viceroy, and, only, then, resign, which, he, did, on, 1, november, 1932, subsequently, a, 1916, veteran, domhnall, ua, buachalla, was, appointed, governor, general, to, strengthen, his, position, against, the, opposition, in, the, d, il, and, seanad, de, valera, directed, the, governor, general, to, call, a, snap, election, in, january, 1933, and, de, valera, s, party, won, 77, seats, giving, fianna, f, il, an, overall, majority, under, de, valera, s, leadership, fianna, f, il, won, further, general, elections, in, 1937, 1938, 1943, and, 1944, de, valera, took, charge, of, ireland, s, foreign, policy, as, well, by, also, acting, as, minister, for, external, affairs, in, that, capacity, he, attended, meetings, of, the, league, of, nations, he, was, president, of, the, council, of, the, league, on, his, first, appearance, at, the, league, in, geneva, switzerland, in, 1932, and, in, a, speech, that, made, a, worldwide, impression, appealed, for, genuine, adherence, by, its, members, to, the, principles, of, the, covenant, of, the, league, in, 1934, he, supported, the, admission, of, the, soviet, union, into, the, league, in, september, 1938, he, was, elected, the, nineteenth, president, of, the, assembly, of, the, league, a, tribute, to, the, international, recognition, he, had, won, by, his, independent, stance, on, world, questions, de, valera, s, government, followed, the, policy, of, unilaterally, dismantling, the, treaty, of, 1921, in, this, way, he, would, be, pursuing, republican, policies, and, lessening, the, popularity, of, republican, violence, and, the, ira, de, valera, encouraged, ira, members, to, join, the, irish, defence, forces, and, the, garda, he, also, refused, to, dismiss, from, office, those, cumann, na, ngaedheal, cosgrave, supporters, who, had, previously, opposed, him, during, the, civil, war, he, did, however, dismiss, eoin, o, duffy, from, his, position, as, garda, commissioner, after, a, year, eoin, o, duffy, was, then, invited, to, be, head, of, the, army, comrades, association, aca, formed, to, protect, and, promote, the, welfare, of, its, members, previously, led, by, j, f, o, higgins, kevin, o, higgins, s, brother, this, organisation, was, an, obstacle, to, de, valera, s, power, as, it, supported, cumann, na, ngaedheal, and, provided, stewards, for, their, meetings, cumann, na, ngaedheal, meetings, were, frequently, disrupted, by, fianna, f, il, supporters, following, the, publication, of, the, article, no, free, speech, for, traitors, by, peadar, o, donnell, an, ira, member, the, aca, changed, its, name, to, the, national, guard, under, o, duffy, and, adopted, the, uniform, of, black, berets, and, blue, shirts, using, the, straight, armed, salute, and, were, nicknamed, the, blueshirts, they, were, outwardly, fascist, and, planned, a, march, in, august, 1933, through, dublin, to, commemorate, michael, collins, kevin, o, higgins, and, arthur, griffith, this, march, struck, parallels, with, mussolini, s, march, on, rome, 1922, in, which, he, had, created, the, image, of, having, toppled, the, democratic, government, in, rome, de, valera, revived, a, military, tribunal, which, had, been, set, up, by, the, previous, administration, to, deal, with, the, matter, o, duffy, backed, down, when, the, national, guard, was, declared, an, illegal, organisation, and, the, march, was, banned, within, a, few, weeks, o, duffy, s, followers, merged, with, cumann, na, ngaedhael, and, the, centre, party, to, form, united, ireland, or, fine, gael, and, o, duffy, became, its, leader, smaller, local, marches, were, scheduled, for, the, following, weeks, under, different, names, internal, dissension, set, in, when, the, party, s, tds, distanced, themselves, from, o, duffy, s, extreme, views, and, his, movement, fell, asunder, fianna, f, il, having, won, the, 1937, election, held, the, same, day, as, the, plebiscite, that, ratified, the, constitution, de, valera, continued, as, president, of, the, executive, council, until, 29, december, 1937, when, the, new, constitution, was, enacted, on, that, date, de, valera, s, post, automatically, became, that, of, taoiseach, which, was, a, considerably, more, powerful, office, notably, he, could, advise, the, president, to, dismiss, ministers, individually, advice, that, the, president, was, bound, to, follow, by, convention, the, old, executive, council, had, to, be, dissolved, and, reformed, en, bloc, if, its, president, wanted, to, remove, a, minister, additionally, he, could, request, a, parliamentary, dissolution, on, his, own, authority, previously, the, right, to, seek, a, dissolution, was, vested, with, the, council, as, a, whole, in, social, policy, de, valera, s, first, period, as, taoiseach, saw, the, introduction, in, 1947, of, means, tested, allowances, for, people, suffering, from, infectious, diseases, with, the, new, constitution, in, place, de, valera, determined, that, the, changed, circumstances, made, swift, resolution, to, ireland, s, ongoing, trade, war, with, the, uk, more, desirable, for, both, sides, as, did, the, growing, probability, of, the, outbreak, of, war, across, europe, in, april, 1938, de, valera, and, british, prime, minister, neville, chamberlain, signed, the, anglo, irish, trade, agreement, lifting, all, duties, imposed, during, the, previous, five, years, and, ending, british, use, of, the, treaty, ports, it, had, retained, in, accordance, with, the, anglo, irish, treaty, the, return, of, the, ports, was, of, particular, significance, since, it, ensured, irish, neutrality, during, the, coming, second, world, war, during, the, 1930s, de, valera, systematically, stripped, the, irish, free, state, constitution, a, constitution, originally, drafted, by, a, committee, under, the, nominal, chairmanship, of, his, rival, collins, of, features, tying, ireland, to, the, united, kingdom, limiting, its, independence, and, the, republican, character, of, its, state, de, valera, was, able, to, carry, out, this, program, of, constitutional, change, by, taking, advantage, of, three, earlier, modifications, of, constitutional, arrangements, first, though, the, 1922, constitution, originally, required, a, public, plebiscite, for, any, amendment, enacted, more, than, eight, years, after, its, passage, the, free, state, government, under, w, t, cosgrave, had, amended, that, period, to, sixteen, years, this, meant, that, until, 1938, the, free, state, constitution, could, be, amended, by, the, simple, passage, of, a, constitutional, amendment, act, through, the, oireachtas, secondly, while, the, governor, general, of, the, irish, free, state, could, reserve, or, deny, royal, assent, to, any, legislation, from, 1927, the, power, to, advise, the, governor, general, to, do, so, no, longer, rested, with, the, british, government, in, london, but, with, his, majesty, s, government, in, the, irish, free, state, which, meant, that, in, practice, the, royal, assent, was, automatically, granted, to, legislation, the, government, was, hardly, likely, to, advise, the, governor, general, to, block, the, enactment, of, one, of, its, own, bills, thirdly, though, in, its, original, theory, the, constitution, had, to, be, in, keeping, with, the, provisions, of, the, anglo, irish, treaty, as, the, fundamental, law, of, the, state, that, requirement, had, been, abrogated, a, short, time, before, de, valera, gained, power, the, oath, of, allegiance, was, abolished, as, were, appeals, to, the, judicial, committee, of, the, privy, council, the, opposition, controlled, senate, when, it, protested, and, slowed, down, these, measures, was, also, abolished, in, 1931, the, british, parliament, passed, the, statute, of, westminster, which, established, the, legislative, equal, status, of, the, self, governing, dominions, of, the, then, british, commonwealth, including, the, irish, free, state, to, one, another, and, the, united, kingdom, though, a, few, constitutional, links, between, the, dominions, and, the, united, kingdom, remained, this, is, often, seen, as, the, moment, at, which, the, dominions, became, fully, sovereign, states, de, valera, in, his, capacity, as, prime, minister, of, his, majesty, s, government, in, the, irish, free, state, wrote, in, july, 1936, to, king, edward, viii, in, london, indicating, that, he, planned, to, introduce, a, new, constitution, the, central, part, of, which, was, to, be, the, creation, of, an, office, de, valera, provisionally, intended, to, call, president, of, saorst, t, ireann, irish, uachtar, n, shaorst, t, ireann, which, would, replace, the, governor, general, de, valera, used, the, sudden, abdication, of, edward, viii, as, king, to, pass, two, bills, one, amended, the, constitution, to, remove, all, mention, of, the, monarch, and, governor, general, while, the, second, brought, the, monarch, back, this, time, through, statute, law, for, use, in, representing, the, irish, free, state, at, a, diplomatic, level, with, the, implementation, of, the, constitution, of, ireland, irish, bunreacht, na, h, ireann, the, title, ultimately, given, to, the, president, was, president, of, ireland, irish, uachtar, n, na, h, ireann, the, constitution, contained, reforms, and, symbols, intended, to, assert, irish, sovereignty, these, included, criticisms, of, some, of, the, above, constitutional, reforms, include, that, as, paul, bew, concludes, in, the, constitution, of, 1937, de, valera, was, trying, to, placate, left, wing, republicans, with, national, phrases, and, pious, people, with, expressly, catholic, bits, patriarchal, catholicism, the, constitution, was, approved, in, a, plebiscite, on, 1, july, 1937, and, came, into, force, on, 29, december, 1937, by, september, 1939, a, general, european, war, was, imminent, on, 2, september, de, valera, advised, d, il, ireann, that, neutrality, was, the, best, policy, for, the, country, this, policy, had, overwhelming, political, and, popular, support, though, some, advocated, irish, participation, in, the, war, on, the, allied, side, while, others, believing, that, england, s, difficulty, is, ireland, s, opportunity, were, pro, german, strong, objections, to, conscription, in, the, north, were, voiced, by, de, valera, in, june, 1940, to, encourage, the, neutral, irish, state, to, join, with, the, allies, winston, churchill, indicated, to, de, valera, that, the, united, kingdom, would, push, for, irish, unity, but, believing, that, churchill, could, not, deliver, de, valera, declined, the, offer, the, day, after, the, attacks, on, pearl, harbor, churchill, wired, de, valera, now, is, your, chance, now, or, never, a, nation, once, again, i, will, meet, you, wherever, you, wish, the, british, did, not, inform, the, government, of, northern, ireland, that, they, had, made, the, offer, to, the, irish, government, and, de, valera, s, rejection, was, not, publicised, until, 1970, the, government, secured, wide, powers, for, the, duration, of, the, emergency, such, as, internment, censorship, of, the, press, and, correspondence, and, government, control, of, the, economy, the, emergency, powers, act, lapsed, on, 2, september, 1946, though, the, state, of, emergency, declared, under, the, constitution, was, not, lifted, until, the, 1970s, this, status, remained, throughout, the, war, despite, pressure, from, chamberlain, and, churchill, however, de, valera, did, respond, to, a, request, from, northern, ireland, for, fire, tenders, to, assist, in, fighting, fires, following, the, 1941, belfast, blitz, persistent, claims, that, de, valera, sent, a, personal, note, of, congratulation, to, subhas, chandra, bose, upon, his, declaration, of, the, azad, hind, free, india, government, in, 1943, have, been, shown, to, be, inaccurate, and, largely, a, misrepresentation, by, japanese, consular, staff, in, dublin, of, a, statement, by, a, small, and, unofficial, republican, group, unconnected, to, the, irish, government, controversially, de, valera, visited, and, offered, condolences, to, the, german, ambassador, in, dublin, on, the, death, of, adolf, hitler, in, 1945, in, accordance, with, diplomatic, protocol, this, did, some, damage, to, ireland, particularly, in, the, united, states, and, soon, afterwards, de, valera, had, a, bitter, exchange, of, words, with, churchill, in, two, famous, radio, addresses, after, the, end, of, the, war, in, europe, de, valera, denounced, reports, of, bergen, belsen, concentration, camp, as, anti, national, propaganda, according, to, bew, this, was, not, out, of, disbelief, but, rather, because, the, holocaust, undermined, the, main, assumption, underlying, irish, neutrality, moral, equivalence, between, the, allies, and, the, axis, the, de, valera, government, was, reputedly, harsh, with, irish, army, deserters, who, had, enlisted, to, fight, with, the, allied, armies, against, the, axis, the, legislation, in, question, was, the, emergency, powers, no, 362, order, which, was, passed, in, august, 1945, on, 18, october, 1945, thomas, f, o, higgins, moved, to, annul, the, order, he, did, not, condone, desertion, but, felt, that, the, order, was, specifically, harsh, on, those, deserters, who, had, served, in, the, allied, forces, general, richard, mulcahy, also, spoke, against, the, order, disagreeing, with, the, way, in, which, it, applied, to, enlisted, men, and, not, to, officers, it, was, revoked, with, effect, from, 1, august, 1946, but, was, in, effect, continued, by, section, 13, of, the, defence, forces, temporary, provisions, act, 1946, after, de, valera, had, spent, sixteen, years, in, power, without, answering, the, crucial, questions, of, partition, and, republican, status, the, public, demanded, a, change, from, the, fianna, f, il, government, in, the, 1948, election, de, valera, lost, the, outright, majority, he, had, enjoyed, since, 1933, it, initially, looked, as, if, the, national, labour, party, would, give, fianna, f, il, enough, support, to, stay, in, office, as, a, minority, government, but, national, labour, insisted, on, a, formal, coalition, agreement, something, de, valera, was, unwilling, to, concede, however, while, fianna, f, il, was, six, seats, short, of, a, majority, it, was, still, by, far, the, largest, party, in, the, d, il, with, 37, more, tds, than, the, next, largest, party, and, rival, fine, gael, the, successor, to, cumann, na, ngaedheal, conventional, wisdom, held, that, de, valera, would, remain, taoiseach, with, the, support, of, independent, deputies, this, belief, came, to, nought, when, after, the, final, votes, were, counted, the, other, parties, realised, that, if, they, banded, together, they, would, have, only, one, seat, fewer, than, fianna, f, il, and, would, be, able, to, form, a, government, with, the, support, of, at, least, seven, independents, the, result, was, the, first, inter, party, government, with, john, a, costello, of, fine, gael, as, its, compromise, candidate, for, taoiseach, costello, was, duly, nominated, consigning, de, valera, to, opposition, for, the, first, time, in, 16, years, the, following, year, costello, declared, ireland, as, a, republic, leaving, partition, as, the, most, pressing, political, issue, of, the, day, de, valera, now, leader, of, the, opposition, left, the, actual, parliamentary, practice, of, opposing, the, government, to, his, deputy, se, n, lemass, and, himself, embarked, on, a, world, campaign, to, address, the, issue, of, partition, he, visited, the, united, states, australia, new, zealand, and, india, and, in, the, latter, country, was, the, last, guest, of, the, governor, general, lord, mountbatten, of, burma, before, he, was, succeeded, by, the, first, indian, born, governor, general, in, melbourne, australia, de, valera, was, feted, by, the, powerful, catholic, archbishop, daniel, mannix, at, the, centenary, celebrations, of, the, diocese, of, melbourne, he, attended, mass, meetings, at, xavier, college, and, addressed, the, assembled, melbourne, celtic, club, in, brisbane, australia, at, the, request, of, the, influential, and, long, serving, archbishop, duhig, de, valera, laid, the, foundation, stone, for, the, new, high, school, building, at, marist, brothers, college, rosalie, in, october, 1950, just, thirty, years, after, his, dramatic, escape, from, lincoln, gaol, he, returned, to, lincoln, and, received, the, freedom, of, the, gaol, the, anti, partition, of, ireland, league, of, great, britain, marked, the, occasion, with, a, dinner, in, his, honour, and, the, toast, was, anglo, irish, friendship, a, key, message, in, de, valera, s, campaign, was, that, ireland, could, not, join, the, recently, established, north, atlantic, treaty, organization, as, long, as, northern, ireland, was, in, british, hands, although, costello, s, government, favoured, alliance, with, nato, de, valera, s, approach, won, more, widespread, support, and, prevented, the, state, from, signing, the, treaty, returning, to, ireland, during, the, mother, and, child, scheme, crisis, that, racked, the, first, inter, party, government, de, valera, kept, silent, as, leader, of, the, opposition, preferring, to, stay, aloof, from, the, controversy, that, stance, helped, return, de, valera, to, power, in, the, 1951, general, election, but, without, an, overall, majority, his, and, fianna, f, il, s, popularity, was, short, lived, however, his, government, introduced, severe, deflationary, budgetary, and, economic, policies, in, 1952, causing, a, political, backlash, that, cost, fianna, f, il, several, seats, in, the, d, il, in, by, elections, of, 1953, and, early, 1954, faced, with, a, likely, loss, of, confidence, in, the, d, il, de, valera, instead, called, an, election, in, may, 1954, in, which, fianna, f, il, was, defeated, and, a, second, inter, party, government, was, formed, with, john, a, costello, again, as, taoiseach, on, 16, september, 1953, de, valera, met, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, for, the, first, and, only, time, at, 10, downing, street, the, two, men, had, seen, each, other, at, a, party, in, 1949, but, without, speaking, he, surprised, the, uk, prime, minister, by, claiming, that, if, he, had, been, in, office, in, 1948, ireland, would, not, have, left, the, commonwealth, it, was, during, this, period, that, de, valera, s, eyesight, began, to, deteriorate, and, he, was, forced, to, spend, several, months, in, the, netherlands, where, he, had, six, operations, in, 1955, while, in, opposition, de, valera, spoke, against, the, formation, of, a, european, parliament, and, european, federalism, noting, that, ireland, did, not, strive, to, get, out, of, that, british, domination, to, get, into, a, worse, like, the, first, coalition, government, the, second, lasted, only, three, years, at, the, general, election, of, 1957, de, valera, then, in, his, seventy, fifth, year, won, an, absolute, majority, of, nine, seats, the, greatest, number, he, had, ever, secured, this, was, the, beginning, of, another, sixteen, year, period,

co, owner, of, one, of, ireland, s, most, influential, group, of, newspapers, irish, press, newspapers, funded, by, numerous, small, investors, who, received, no, dividend, for, decades, de, valera, is, alleged, by, critics, to, have, helped, keep, ireland, under, the, influence, of, catholic, conservatism, de, valera, rejected, however, demands, by, organisations, like, maria, duce, that, roman, catholicism, be, made, the, state, religion, of, ireland, just, as, he, rejected, demands, by, the, irish, christian, front, for, the, irish, free, state, to, support, francisco, franco, during, the, spanish, civil, war, de, valera, s, preoccupation, with, his, part, in, history, and, his, need, to, explain, and, justify, it, are, reflected, in, innumerable, ways, his, faith, in, historians, as, trustworthy, guardians, of, his, reputation, was, not, absolute, he, made, many, attempts, to, influence, their, views, and, to, adjust, and, refine, the, historical, record, whenever, he, felt, this, portrayed, him, his, allies, or, his, cause, inaccurately, or, unfavourably, to, his, mind, these, could, often, mean, the, same, thing, he, extended, these, endeavours, to, encompass, the, larger, irish, public, an, important, function, of, his, newspaper, group, the, irish, press, group, was, to, rectify, what, he, saw, as, the, errors, and, omissions, of, a, decade, in, which, he, had, been, the, subject, of, largely, hostile, commentary, in, recent, decades, his, role, in, irish, history, has, no, longer, been, unequivocally, seen, by, historians, as, a, positive, one, and, a, biography, by, tim, pat, coogan, alleges, that, his, failures, outweigh, his, achievements, with, de, valera, s, reputation, declining, while, that, of, his, great, rival, in, the, 1920s, michael, collins, was, rising, a, more, recent, 2007, work, on, de, valera, by, historian, diarmaid, ferriter, presents, a, more, positive, picture, of, de, valera, s, legacy, bertie, ahern, at, a, book, launch, for, diarmaid, ferriter, s, biography, of, de, valera, described, de, valera, s, achievements, in, political, leadership, during, the, formative, years, of, the, state, one, of, de, valera, s, finest, hours, was, his, regrouping, of, the, republican, side, after, defeat, in, the, civil, war, and, setting, his, followers, on, an, exclusively, peaceful, and, democratic, path, along, which, he, later, had, to, confront, both, domestic, fascism, and, the, ira, he, became, a, democratic, statesman, not, a, dictator, he, did, not, purge, the, civil, service, of, those, who, had, served, his, predecessors, but, made, the, best, use, of, the, talent, available, a, notable, failure, was, his, attempt, to, reverse, the, provision, of, the, 1937, constitution, in, relation, to, the, electoral, system, on, retiring, as, taoiseach, in, 1959, he, proposed, that, the, proportional, representation, system, enshrined, in, that, constitution, should, be, replaced, de, valera, argued, that, proportional, representation, had, been, responsible, for, the, instability, that, had, characterised, much, of, the, post, war, period, a, constitutional, referendum, to, ratify, this, was, defeated, by, the, people, one, aspect, of, de, valera, s, legacy, is, that, since, the, foundation, of, the, state, a, de, valera, has, nearly, always, served, in, d, il, ireann, amon, de, valera, served, until, 1959, his, son, vivion, de, valera, was, also, a, teachta, d, la, td, amon, cu, v, his, grandson, is, currently, a, member, of, the, d, il, while, his, granddaughter, s, le, de, valera, is, a, former, td, both, have, served, in, ministries, in, the, irish, government, in, 1931, de, valera, said, in, the, d, il, i, believe, that, every, citizen, in, this, country, is, entitled, to, his, share, of, public, appointments, and, that, there, should, not, be, discrimination, on, the, ground, of, religion, discrimination, mind, you, in, the, sense, that, because, a, person, was, of, a, particular, religion, religion, should, not, be, made, an, excuse, for, denying, a, person, an, appointment, for, which, he, or, she, was, fully, qualified, then, there, comes, the, question, what, are, qualifications, if, i, thought, that, the, principle, that, the, librarian, in, a, catholic, community, should, be, catholic, was, a, new, principle, introduced, merely, to, deny, a, protestant, an, appointment, i, would, vote, against, it, but, i, know, from, my, youth, that, it, is, not, so, if, i, had, a, vote, on, a, local, body, and, if, there, were, two, qualified, people, who, had, to, deal, with, a, catholic, community, and, if, one, was, a, catholic, and, the, other, a, protestant, i, would, unhesitatingly, vote, for, the, catholic, let, us, be, clear, and, let, us, know, where, we, are, ryle, dwyer, writing, in, 2008, said, if, those, were, his, honest, views, one, could, also, say, without, hesitation, that, the, long, fellow, was, a, bigot, but, in, fact, he, was, just, playing, the, role, of, a, political, hypocrite, it, was, cynical, but, it, should, be, stressed, that, he, behaved, responsibly, in, this, regard, when, he, came, to, power, de, valera, led, fianna, f, il, to, adopt, conservative, social, policies, since, he, believed, devoutly, that, the, catholic, church, and, the, family, were, central, to, irish, identity, he, added, clauses, to, the, new, constitution, of, ireland, 1937, to, guard, with, special, care, the, institution, of, marriage, and, prohibit, divorce, his, constitution, also, recognised, the, special, position, of, the, catholic, church, and, recognised, other, denominations, including, the, church, of, ireland, and, jewish, congregations, while, guaranteeing, the, religious, freedom, of, all, citizens, however, he, resisted, an, attempt, to, make, roman, catholicism, the, state, religion, and, his, constitution, forbids, the, establishment, of, a, state, religion, his, policies, were, welcomed, by, a, largely, devout, conservative, and, rural, electorate, the, unenforceable, articles, in, the, constitution, which, reinforced, the, traditional, view, that, a, woman, s, place, was, in, the, home, further, illustrate, the, direction, in, which, ireland, was, moving, an, act, of, 1935, prohibited, the, importation, or, sale, of, contraceptives, the, most, rigorous, censorship, laws, in, western, europe, complete, the, picture, the, specific, recognition, of, roman, catholicism, was, deleted, by, the, fifth, amendment, of, the, constitution, of, ireland, 1973, and, the, prohibition, of, divorce, was, removed, by, the, fifteenth, amendment, of, the, constitution, of, ireland, 1996, nevertheless, the, irish, supreme, court, declared, in, 1973, that, the, 1935, contraception, legislation, was, not, repugnant, to, the, constitution, and, therefore, remained, valid, subsequent, laws, have, liberalised, the, use, of, contraception, however, see, contraception, in, the, republic, of, ireland, de, valera, s, portrait, illustrated, the, front, cover, of, the, 25, march, 1940, issue, of, time, magazine, accompanying, the, article, eire, prime, minister, of, freedom, he, has, been, portrayed, by, the,
