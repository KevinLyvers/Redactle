jan, hus, h, s, czech, c, 1370, 6, july, 1415, sometimes, anglicized, as, john, hus, or, john, huss, and, referred, to, in, historical, texts, as, iohannes, hus, or, johannes, huss, was, a, czech, theologian, and, philosopher, who, became, a, church, reformer, and, the, inspiration, of, hussitism, a, key, predecessor, to, protestantism, and, a, seminal, figure, in, the, bohemian, reformation, hus, is, considered, to, be, the, first, church, reformer, even, though, some, designate, the, theorist, john, wycliffe, his, teachings, had, a, strong, influence, most, immediately, in, the, approval, of, a, reformed, bohemian, religious, denomination, and, over, a, century, later, on, martin, luther, after, being, ordained, as, a, catholic, priest, hus, began, to, preach, in, prague, he, opposed, many, aspects, of, the, catholic, church, in, bohemia, such, as, its, views, on, ecclesiology, simony, the, eucharist, and, other, theological, topics, hus, was, a, master, dean, and, rector, at, the, charles, university, in, prague, between, 1409, and, 1410, alexander, v, issued, a, papal, bull, that, excommunicated, hus, however, it, was, not, enforced, and, hus, continued, to, preach, hus, then, spoke, out, against, alexander, v, s, successor, antipope, john, xxiii, for, his, selling, of, indulgences, hus, excommunication, was, then, enforced, and, he, spent, the, next, two, years, living, in, exile, when, the, council, of, constance, assembled, hus, was, asked, to, be, there, and, present, his, views, on, the, dissension, within, the, church, when, he, arrived, with, a, promise, of, safe, conduct, he, was, arrested, and, put, in, prison, he, was, eventually, taken, in, front, of, the, council, and, asked, to, recant, his, views, he, refused, on, 6, july, 1415, he, was, burned, at, the, stake, for, heresy, against, the, teachings, of, the, catholic, church, after, hus, was, executed, the, followers, of, his, religious, teachings, known, as, hussites, refused, to, elect, another, catholic, monarch, and, defeated, five, consecutive, papal, crusades, between, 1420, and, 1431, in, what, became, known, as, the, hussite, wars, both, the, bohemian, and, the, moravian, populations, remained, majority, hussite, until, the, 1620s, when, a, protestant, defeat, in, the, battle, of, the, white, mountain, resulted, in, the, lands, of, the, bohemian, crown, coming, under, habsburg, dominion, for, the, next, 300, years, and, being, subject, to, immediate, and, forced, conversion, in, an, intense, campaign, of, return, to, catholicism, the, exact, date, of, hus, s, birth, is, disputed, some, claim, he, was, born, around, 1369, while, others, claim, he, was, born, between, 1373, and, 1375, though, older, sources, state, the, latter, more, contemporary, research, states, that, 1372, is, more, likely, the, belief, that, he, was, born, on, 6, july, also, his, death, day, has, no, factual, basis, hus, was, born, in, husinec, southern, bohemia, to, peasant, parents, it, is, well, known, that, hus, took, his, name, from, the, village, where, he, lived, husinec, the, reason, behind, him, taking, his, name, from, his, village, rather, than, from, his, father, is, up, to, speculation, some, believe, that, it, was, because, hus, did, not, know, of, his, father, while, others, say, it, was, simply, a, custom, at, that, time, the, name, hus, however, means, goose, in, bohemian, now, called, czech, and, he, was, a, century, later, referenced, as, a, bohemian, goose, in, a, dream, given, to, frederick, the, elector, of, saxony, nearly, all, other, information, known, about, hus, s, very, early, life, is, unsubstantiated, similarly, we, know, little, of, hus, s, family, his, father, s, name, was, michael, his, mother, s, name, is, unknown, it, is, known, that, hus, had, a, brother, due, to, him, expressing, concerns, for, his, nephew, while, awaiting, execution, at, constance, whether, or, not, hus, had, any, other, family, is, unknown, at, the, age, of, roughly, 10, hus, was, sent, away, to, a, monastery, the, exact, reason, is, not, known, some, claim, that, his, father, had, died, others, say, he, went, there, due, to, his, devotion, to, god, he, impressed, the, teachers, with, his, studies, and, they, recommended, him, to, move, to, prague, one, of, the, largest, cities, in, bohemia, at, that, time, hus, apparently, supported, himself, by, securing, employment, in, prague, which, allowed, him, to, fulfill, his, basic, necessities, and, access, to, the, prague, library, three, years, later, he, was, admitted, to, the, university, of, prague, though, not, an, exceptional, student, he, pursued, his, studies, with, ferocity, in, 1393, hus, earned, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, at, the, university, of, prague, and, he, earned, his, master, s, degree, in, 1396, the, strongly, anti, papal, views, that, were, held, by, many, of, the, professors, there, likely, influenced, hus, s, future, works, during, his, studies, he, served, as, a, choir, boy, to, supplement, his, earnings, hus, began, teaching, at, the, university, of, prague, in, 1398, and, in, 1399, he, first, publicly, defended, propositions, of, wycliffe, he, was, ordained, as, a, catholic, priest, in, 1400, in, 1401, his, students, and, faculty, promoted, him, to, dean, of, the, philosophical, department, and, a, year, later, he, became, a, rector, of, the, university, of, prague, he, was, appointed, a, preacher, at, the, bethlehem, chapel, in, 1402, hus, was, a, strong, advocate, for, the, czechs, and, the, realists, and, he, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, john, wycliffe, although, church, authorities, banned, many, of, wycliffe, s, works, in, 1403, hus, translated, trialogus, into, czech, and, helped, to, distribute, it, hus, denounced, the, moral, failings, of, clergy, bishops, and, even, the, papacy, from, his, pulpit, archbishop, zbyn, k, zaj, c, tolerated, this, and, even, appointed, hus, a, preacher, at, the, clergy, s, biennial, synod, on, 24, june, 1405, pope, innocent, vii, directed, the, archbishop, to, counter, wycliffe, s, teachings, especially, the, idea, of, impanation, in, the, eucharist, the, archbishop, complied, by, issuing, a, synod, decree, against, wycliffe, as, well, as, forbidding, any, further, attacks, on, the, clergy, in, 1406, two, bohemian, students, brought, to, prague, a, document, bearing, the, seal, of, the, university, of, oxford, and, praising, wycliffe, hus, proudly, read, the, document, from, his, pulpit, then, in, 1408, pope, gregory, xii, warned, archbishop, zajic, that, the, church, in, rome, had, been, informed, of, wycliffe, s, heresies, and, of, the, sympathies, of, king, wenceslaus, iv, of, bohemia, for, nonconformists, in, response, the, king, and, university, ordered, all, of, wycliffe, s, writings, surrendered, to, the, archdiocesan, chancery, for, correction, hus, obeyed, declaring, that, he, condemned, the, errors, in, those, writings, in, 1408, the, charles, university, in, prague, was, divided, by, the, western, schism, in, which, gregory, xii, in, rome, and, benedict, xiii, in, avignon, both, claimed, the, papacy, wenceslaus, felt, gregory, xii, might, interfere, with, his, plans, to, be, crowned, holy, roman, emperor, he, denounced, gregory, ordered, the, clergy, in, bohemia, to, observe, a, strict, neutrality, in, the, schism, and, said, that, he, expected, the, same, of, the, university, archbishop, zaj, c, remained, faithful, to, gregory, at, the, university, only, the, scholars, of, the, bohemian, nation, one, of, the, four, governing, sections, with, hus, as, their, leader, vowed, neutrality, in, january, 1409, wenceslaus, summoned, representatives, of, the, four, nations, comprising, the, university, to, the, czech, city, of, kutn, hora, to, demand, statements, of, allegiance, the, czech, nation, agreed, but, the, other, three, nations, declined, the, king, then, decreed, that, the, czech, nation, would, have, three, votes, in, university, affairs, while, the, german, nation, composed, of, the, former, bavarian, saxon, and, polish, nations, would, have, one, vote, in, total, due, to, the, change, in, voting, structure, by, may, 1409, the, german, dean, and, rector, were, deposed, and, replaced, by, czechs, the, palatine, elector, called, the, germans, to, his, own, university, of, heidelberg, while, the, margrave, of, meissen, started, a, new, university, in, leipzig, it, is, estimated, that, over, one, thousand, students, and, masters, left, prague, the, emigrants, also, spread, accusations, of, bohemian, heresy, in, 1409, the, council, of, pisa, tried, to, end, the, schism, by, electing, alexander, v, as, pope, but, gregory, and, benedict, did, not, submit, alexander, was, declared, an, antipope, by, the, council, of, constance, in, 1418, hus, his, followers, and, wenceslaus, iv, transferred, their, allegiance, to, alexander, v, under, pressure, from, king, wenceslaus, iv, archbishop, zaj, c, did, the, same, zaj, c, then, lodged, an, accusation, of, ecclesiastical, disturbances, against, wycliffites, in, prague, with, alexander, v, on, 20, december, 1409, alexander, v, issued, a, papal, bull, that, empowered, the, archbishop, to, proceed, against, wycliffism, in, prague, all, copies, of, wycliffe, s, writings, were, to, be, surrendered, and, his, views, repudiated, and, free, preaching, discontinued, after, the, publication, of, the, bull, in, 1410, hus, appealed, to, alexander, v, but, in, vain, the, wycliffe, books, and, valuable, manuscripts, were, burned, and, hus, and, his, adherents, were, excommunicated, by, alexander, v, alexander, v, died, in, 1410, and, was, succeeded, by, john, xxiii, also, later, declared, an, antipope, in, 1411, john, xxiii, proclaimed, a, crusade, against, king, ladislaus, of, naples, the, protector, of, rival, pope, gregory, xii, this, crusade, was, preached, in, prague, as, well, john, xxiii, also, authorized, indulgences, to, raise, money, for, the, war, priests, urged, the, people, on, and, they, crowded, into, churches, to, give, their, offerings, this, traffic, in, indulgences, was, a, sign, of, the, corruption, of, the, church, needing, remediation, archbishop, zaj, c, died, in, 1411, and, with, his, death, the, religious, movement, in, bohemia, entered, a, new, phase, during, which, the, disputes, concerning, indulgences, assumed, great, importance, hus, spoke, out, against, indulgences, but, he, could, not, carry, with, him, the, men, of, the, university, in, 1412, a, dispute, took, place, on, which, occasion, hus, delivered, his, address, quaestio, magistri, johannis, hus, de, indulgentiis, it, was, taken, literally, from, the, last, chapter, of, wycliffe, s, book, de, ecclesia, and, his, treatise, de, absolutione, a, pena, et, culpa, hus, asserted, that, no, pope, or, bishop, had, the, right, to, take, up, the, sword, in, the, name, of, the, church, he, should, pray, for, his, enemies, and, bless, those, who, curse, him, man, obtains, forgiveness, of, sins, by, true, repentance, not, money, the, doctors, of, the, theological, faculty, replied, but, without, success, a, few, days, afterward, some, of, hus, followers, led, by, vok, voksa, z, vald, tejna, burned, the, papal, bulls, hus, they, said, should, be, obeyed, rather, than, the, church, which, they, considered, a, fraudulent, mob, of, adulterers, and, simonists, in, response, three, men, from, the, lower, classes, who, openly, called, the, indulgences, a, fraud, were, beheaded, they, were, later, considered, the, first, martyrs, of, the, hussite, church, in, the, meantime, the, faculty, had, condemned, the, forty, five, articles, of, wycliffe, and, added, several, other, theses, deemed, heretical, which, had, originated, with, hus, the, king, forbade, the, teaching, of, these, articles, but, neither, hus, nor, the, university, complied, with, the, ruling, they, requested, that, the, articles, should, be, first, proven, to, be, un, scriptural, the, tumults, at, prague, had, stirred, up, a, sensation, papal, legates, and, archbishop, albik, tried, to, persuade, hus, to, give, up, his, opposition, to, the, papal, bulls, and, the, king, made, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, reconcile, the, two, parties, king, wenceslaus, iv, made, efforts, to, harmonize, the, opposing, parties, in, 1412, he, convoked, the, heads, of, his, kingdom, for, a, consultation, and, at, their, suggestion, ordered, a, synod, to, be, held, at, esk, brod, on, 2, february, 1412, the, synod, was, instead, held, in, the, palace, of, the, archbishops, at, prague, in, order, to, exclude, hus, from, participation, propositions, were, made, to, restore, peace, in, the, church, hus, declared, that, bohemia, should, have, the, same, freedom, in, regard, to, ecclesiastical, affairs, as, other, countries, and, that, approbation, and, condemnation, should, therefore, be, announced, only, with, the, permission, of, the, state, power, this, was, the, view, of, wycliffe, sermones, iii, 519, etc, there, followed, treatises, from, both, parties, but, no, harmony, was, obtained, even, if, i, should, stand, before, the, stake, which, has, been, prepared, for, me, hus, wrote, at, the, time, i, would, never, accept, the, recommendation, of, the, theological, faculty, the, synod, did, not, produce, any, results, but, the, king, ordered, a, commission, to, continue, the, work, of, reconciliation, the, doctors, of, the, university, demanded, hus, and, his, followers, approve, the, university, s, conception, of, the, church, according, to, this, conception, the, pope, is, the, head, of, the, church, and, the, cardinals, are, the, body, of, the, church, hus, protested, vigorously, the, hussite, party, seems, to, have, made, a, great, effort, toward, reconciliation, to, the, article, that, the, roman, church, must, be, obeyed, they, added, only, so, far, as, every, pious, christian, is, bound, stanislav, ze, znojma, and, t, p, n, p, le, protested, against, this, addition, and, left, the, convention, they, were, exiled, by, the, king, with, two, others, by, this, time, hus, s, ideas, had, become, widely, accepted, in, bohemia, and, there, was, broad, resentment, against, the, church, hierarchy, the, attack, on, hus, by, the, pope, and, archbishop, caused, riots, in, parts, of, bohemia, king, wenceslaus, iv, and, his, government, took, the, side, of, hus, and, the, power, of, his, adherents, increased, from, day, to, day, hus, continued, to, preach, in, the, bethlehem, chapel, the, churches, of, the, city, were, put, under, the, ban, and, an, interdict, was, pronounced, against, prague, to, protect, the, city, hus, left, and, went, into, the, countryside, where, he, continued, to, preach, and, write, before, hus, left, prague, he, decided, to, take, a, step, which, gave, a, new, dimension, to, his, endeavors, he, wanted, to, become, a, preacher, and, then, taught, at, the, university, he, studied, at, before, he, no, longer, put, his, trust, in, an, indecisive, king, a, hostile, pope, or, an, ineffective, council, on, 18, october, 1412, he, appealed, to, jesus, christ, as, the, supreme, judge, by, appealing, directly, to, the, highest, christian, authority, christ, himself, he, bypassed, the, laws, and, structures, of, the, medieval, church, for, the, bohemian, reformation, this, step, was, as, significant, as, the, 95, theses, posted, in, wittenberg, by, martin, luther, in, 1517, after, hus, left, prague, for, the, country, he, realized, what, a, gulf, there, was, between, university, education, and, theological, speculation, and, the, life, of, uneducated, country, priests, and, the, laymen, entrusted, to, their, care, therefore, he, started, to, write, many, texts, in, czech, such, as, basics, of, the, christian, faith, or, preachings, intended, mainly, for, the, priests, whose, knowledge, of, latin, was, poor, of, the, writings, occasioned, by, these, controversies, those, of, hus, on, the, church, entitled, de, ecclesia, were, written, in, 1413, and, have, been, most, frequently, quoted, and, admired, or, criticized, yet, their, first, ten, chapters, are, an, epitome, of, wycliffe, s, work, of, the, same, title, and, the, following, chapters, are, an, abstract, of, another, of, wycliffe, s, works, de, potentate, papae, on, the, power, of, the, pope, wycliffe, had, written, his, book, to, oppose, the, common, position, that, the, church, consisted, primarily, of, the, clergy, and, hus, now, found, himself, making, the, same, point, he, wrote, his, work, at, the, castle, of, one, of, his, protectors, in, koz, hr, dek, and, sent, it, to, prague, where, it, was, publicly, read, in, the, bethlehem, chapel, it, was, answered, by, stanislav, ze, znojma, and, t, p, n, z, p, l, e, also, t, p, n, p, le, with, treatises, of, the, same, title, after, the, most, vehement, opponents, of, hus, had, left, prague, his, adherents, occupied, the, whole, ground, hus, wrote, his, treatises, and, preached, in, the, neighborhood, of, koz, hr, dek, bohemian, wycliffism, was, carried, into, poland, hungary, croatia, and, austria, but, in, january, 1413, a, general, council, in, rome, condemned, the, writings, of, wycliffe, and, ordered, them, to, be, burned, king, wenceslaus, s, brother, sigismund, of, hungary, who, was, king, of, the, romans, that, is, head, of, the, holy, roman, empire, though, not, then, emperor, and, heir, to, the, bohemian, crown, was, anxious, to, put, an, end, to, religious, dissension, within, the, church, to, put, an, end, to, the, papal, schism, and, to, take, up, the, long, desired, reform, of, the, church, he, arranged, for, a, general, council, to, convene, on, 1, november, 1414, at, konstanz, constance, the, council, of, constance, 1414, 1418, became, the, 16th, ecumenical, council, recognized, by, the, catholic, church, hus, willing, to, make, an, end, to, all, dissensions, agreed, to, go, to, constance, under, sigismund, s, promise, of, safe, conduct, it, is, not, known, whether, hus, knew, what, his, fate, would, be, however, he, made, his, will, before, setting, out, he, started, on, his, journey, on, 11, october, 1414, arriving, in, constance, on, 3, november, 1414, the, following, day, the, bulletins, on, the, church, doors, announced, that, michal, z, n, meck, ho, brodu, michal, de, causis, would, be, opposing, hus, in, the, beginning, hus, was, at, liberty, under, his, safe, conduct, from, sigismund, and, lived, at, the, house, of, a, widow, but, he, continued, celebrating, mass, and, preaching, to, the, people, in, violation, of, restrictions, decreed, by, the, church, after, a, few, weeks, on, 28, november, 1414, his, opponents, succeeded, in, imprisoning, him, on, the, strength, of, a, rumor, that, he, intended, to, flee, he, was, first, brought, into, the, residence, of, a, canon, and, then, on, 6, december, 1414, into, the, prison, of, the, dominican, monastery, sigismund, as, the, guarantor, of, hus, s, safety, was, greatly, angered, and, threatened, the, prelates, with, dismissal, the, prelates, convinced, him, that, he, could, not, be, bound, by, promises, to, a, heretic, on, 4, december, 1414, john, xxiii, entrusted, a, committee, of, three, bishops, with, a, preliminary, investigation, against, hus, as, was, common, practice, witnesses, for, the, prosecution, were, heard, but, hus, was, not, allowed, an, advocate, for, his, defense, his, situation, became, worse, after, the, downfall, of, john, xxiii, who, had, left, constance, to, avoid, abdicating, hus, had, been, the, captive, of, john, xxiii, and, in, constant, communication, with, his, friends, but, now, he, was, delivered, to, the, bishop, of, constance, and, brought, to, his, castle, gottlieben, on, the, rhine, here, he, remained, for, 73, days, separated, from, his, friends, chained, day, and, night, poorly, fed, and, ill, on, 5, june, 1415, he, was, tried, for, the, first, time, and, was, transferred, to, a, franciscan, monastery, where, he, spent, the, last, weeks, of, his, life, extracts, from, his, works, were, read, and, witnesses, were, heard, he, refused, all, formulae, of, submission, but, declared, himself, willing, to, recant, if, his, errors, should, be, proven, to, him, from, the, bible, hus, conceded, his, veneration, of, wycliffe, and, said, that, he, could, only, wish, his, soul, might, some, time, attain, unto, that, place, where, wycliffe, s, was, on, the, other, hand, he, denied, having, defended, wycliffe, s, view, of, the, lord, s, supper, or, the, forty, five, articles, he, had, only, opposed, their, summary, condemnation, king, sigismund, admonished, him, to, deliver, himself, up, to, the, mercy, of, the, council, as, he, did, not, desire, to, protect, a, heretic, at, the, last, trial, on, 8, june, 1415, thirty, nine, sentences, were, read, to, him, of, these, twenty, six, had, been, excerpted, from, his, book, on, the, church, de, ecclesia, seven, from, his, treatise, against, p, le, contra, palecz, and, six, from, that, against, stanislav, ze, znojma, contra, stanislaum, the, danger, of, some, of, these, views, to, worldly, power, was, explained, to, sigismund, to, incite, him, against, hus, hus, again, declared, himself, willing, to, submit, if, he, could, be, convinced, of, errors, this, declaration, was, considered, an, unconditional, surrender, and, he, was, asked, to, confess, 1, that, he, had, erred, in, the, theses, which, he, had, hitherto, maintained, 2, that, he, renounced, them, for, the, future, 3, that, he, recanted, them, and, 4, that, he, declared, the, opposite, of, these, sentences, he, asked, to, be, exempted, from, recanting, teachings, which, he, had, never, taught, other, views, which, the, assembly, considered, erroneous, he, was, not, willing, to, revoke, and, to, act, differently, would, be, against, his, conscience, these, words, found, no, favorable, reception, after, the, trial, on, 8, june, several, other, attempts, were, purportedly, made, to, induce, him, to, recant, which, he, resisted, the, condemnation, of, jan, hus, took, place, on, 6, july, 1415, in, the, presence, of, the, assembly, of, the, council, in, the, cathedral, after, the, high,

and, wycliffe, and, a, report, of, his, trial, were, then, read, an, italian, prelate, pronounced, the, sentence, of, condemnation, upon, hus, and, his, writings, hus, protested, saying, that, even, at, this, hour, he, did, not, wish, anything, but, to, be, convinced, from, scripture, he, fell, upon, his, knees, and, asked, god, with, a, soft, voice, to, forgive, all, his, enemies, then, followed, his, degradation, from, the, priesthood, he, was, dressed, in, priestly, vestments, and, again, asked, to, recant, and, again, he, refused, with, curses, hus, s, ornaments, were, taken, from, him, his, priestly, tonsure, was, destroyed, the, judgment, of, the, church, was, pronounced, this, holy, synod, of, constance, seeing, that, god, s, church, has, nothing, more, that, it, can, do, relinquishes, john, hus, to, the, judgment, of, the, secular, authority, and, decrees, that, he, is, to, be, relinquished, to, the, secular, court, a, tall, paper, hat, was, allegedly, put, upon, his, head, with, the, inscription, haeresiarcha, i, e, the, leader, of, a, heretical, movement, hus, was, led, away, to, the, stake, under, a, strong, guard, of, armed, men, before, his, execution, hus, is, said, to, have, declared, you, may, kill, a, weak, goose, but, more, powerful, birds, eagles, and, falcons, will, come, after, me, luther, modified, the, statement, and, reported, that, hus, had, said, that, they, might, have, roasted, a, goose, but, that, in, a, hundred, years, a, swan, would, sing, to, whom, they, be, forced, to, listen, in, 1546, in, his, funeral, sermon, for, luther, johannes, bugenhagen, gave, a, further, twist, to, hus, s, declaration, you, may, burn, a, goose, but, in, a, hundred, years, will, come, a, swan, you, will, not, be, able, to, burn, twenty, years, later, in, 1566, johannes, mathesius, luther, s, first, biographer, found, hus, s, prophecy, to, be, evidence, of, luther, s, divine, inspiration, at, the, place, of, execution, he, knelt, down, spread, out, his, hands, and, prayed, aloud, the, executioner, undressed, hus, and, tied, his, hands, behind, his, back, with, ropes, his, neck, was, bound, with, a, chain, to, a, stake, around, which, wood, and, straw, had, been, piled, up, so, that, it, covered, him, to, the, neck, at, the, last, moment, the, imperial, marshal, von, pappenheim, in, the, presence, of, the, count, palatine, asked, hus, to, recant, and, thus, save, his, own, life, hus, declined, stating, god, is, my, witness, that, the, things, charged, against, me, i, never, preached, in, the, same, truth, of, the, gospel, which, i, have, written, taught, and, preached, drawing, upon, the, sayings, and, positions, of, the, holy, doctors, i, am, ready, to, die, today, anecdotally, it, has, been, said, that, the, executioners, had, trouble, intensifying, the, fire, an, old, woman, then, came, to, the, stake, and, threw, a, relatively, small, amount, of, brushwood, on, it, upon, seeing, her, act, a, suffering, hus, then, exclaimed, o, sancta, simplicitas, o, holy, simplicity, it, is, said, that, when, he, was, about, to, expire, he, cried, out, christ, son, of, the, living, god, have, mercy, on, us, a, variant, of, the, jesus, prayer, hus, s, ashes, were, later, thrown, into, the, rhine, river, as, a, means, of, preventing, the, veneration, of, his, remains, as, news, of, hus, s, death, spread, outrage, was, brewing, from, the, local, nobles, and, doctors, on, 2, september, 1415, a, document, now, called, the, bohemian, protest, was, signed, with, corresponding, attached, wax, seals, by, 100, notable, people, from, bohemia, and, moravia, in, protest, of, jan, hus, s, burning, there, is, evidence, that, four, documents, of, this, kind, were, made, in, total, however, only, this, one, is, known, to, survive, and, is, currently, held, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, the, statement, inside, reads, that, master, john, hus, was, a, good, just, and, catholic, man, that, consistently, detested, all, error, and, heresies, and, that, anyone, that, believed, that, heresy, was, arising, within, bohemia, or, moravia, to, be, the, worst, of, traitors, responding, with, horror, to, the, execution, of, hus, the, people, of, bohemia, moved, even, more, rapidly, away, from, papal, teachings, rome, then, pronounced, a, crusade, against, them, 1, march, 1420, pope,

was, unable, to, establish, a, real, government, in, bohemia, due, to, the, hussite, revolt, the, hussite, community, included, most, of, the, czech, population, of, the, kingdom, of, bohemia, under, the, leadership, of, jan, i, ka, c, 1360, 1424, and, later, of, prokop, the, great, c, 1380, 1434, both, excellent, commanders, the, hussites, defeated, the, crusade, and, the, other, three, crusades, that, followed, 1419, 1434, fighting, ended, after, a, compromise, between, the, utraquist, hussites, and, the, catholic, council, of, basel, in, 1436, it, resulted, in, the, basel, compacts, in, which, the, catholic, church, officially, allowed, bohemia, to, practice, its, own, version, of, christianity, hussitism, a, century, later, as, much, as, ninety, percent, of, the, inhabitants, of, the, czech, crown, lands, still, followed, hussite, teachings, hus, left, reformatory, writings, he, translated, wycliffe, s, trialogus, and, was, very, familiar, with, his, works, on, the, body, of, jesus, the, church, and, the, power, of, the, pope, as, well, as, and, especially, with, his, sermons, there, are, reasons, to, suppose, that, wycliffe, s, view, of, the, lord, s, supper, consubstantiation, rather, than, transubstantiation, had, spread, to, prague, as, early, as, 1399, with, strong, evidence, that, students, returning, from, england, had, brought, the, work, back, with, them, it, gained, an, even, wider, circulation, after, it, had, been, prohibited, in, 1403, and, hus, preached, and, taught, it, the, view, was, seized, eagerly, by, the, taborites, who, made, it, the, central, point, of, their, system, according, to, their, book, the, church, is, not, the, clerical, hierarchy, that, was, generally, accepted, as, the, church, the, church, is, the, entire,

neither, internal, membership, in, the, church, nor, churchly, offices, and, dignities, are, a, surety, that, the, persons, in, question, are, members, of, the, true, church, hus, s, efforts, were, designed, to, rid, the, church, of, its, ethical, abuses, the, seeds, of, the, reformation, are, clear, in, hus, s, and, wycliffe, s, writings, in, explaining, the, plight, of, the, average, christian, in, bohemia, hus, wrote, one, pays, for, confession, for, mass, for, the, sacrament, for, indulgences, for, churching, a, woman, for, a, blessing, for, burials, for, funeral, services, and,

death, his, followers, known, as, hussites, split, off, into, several, groups, including, the, utraquists, taborites, and, orphans, nearly, six, centuries, later, in, 1999, pope, john, paul, ii, expressed, deep, regret, for, the, cruel, death, inflicted, on, hus, and, added, deep, sorrow, for, hus, s, death, and, praised, his, moral, courage, cardinal, miloslav, vlk, of, the, czech, republic, was, instrumental, in, crafting, john, paul, ii, s, statement, members, of, the, moravian, church, believe, that, it, remains, for, god, to, judge, those, who, were, involved, in, the, death, of, hus,
