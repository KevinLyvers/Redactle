slaves, in, the, ottoman, court, elevating, their, status, higher, than, ottoman, princesses, in, this, case, suleiman, not, only, broke, the, old, custom, but, began, a, new, tradition, for, the, future, ottoman, sultans, to, marry, in, a, formal, ceremony, and, to, give, their, consorts, significant, influence, on, the, court, especially, in, matters, of, succession, h, rrem, s, salary, was,

and, controlled, by, his, wife, also, in, ottoman, society, mothers, played, more, influential, roles, in, their, sons, educations, and, in, guiding, their, careers, after, the, death, of, suleiman, s, mother, hafsa, sultan, in, 1534, h, rrem, became, the, most, trusted, news, source, of, suleiman, in, one, of, her, letters, to, suleiman, she, informs, him, about, the, situation, of, the, plague, in, the, capital, she, wrote, my, dearest, sultan, if, you, ask, about, istanbul, the, city, still, suffers, from, the, plague, however, it, is, not, like, the, previous, one, god, willing, it, will, go, away, as, soon, as, you, return, to, the, city, our, ancestors, said, that, the, plague, goes, away, once, the, trees, shed, their, leaves, in, autumn, later, h, rrem, became, the, first, woman, to, remain, in, the, sultan, s, court, for, the, duration, of, her, life, in, the, ottoman, imperial, family, tradition, a, sultan, s, consort, was, to, remain, in, the, harem, only, until, her, son, came, of, age, around, 16, or, 17, after, which, he, would, be, sent, away, from, the, capital, to, govern, a, faraway, province, and, his, mother, would, follow, him, this, tradition, was, called, sancak, beyli, i, the, consorts, were, never, to, return, to, istanbul, unless, their, sons, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, defiance, of, this, age, old, custom, h, rrem, stayed, behind, in, the, harem, even, after, her, sons, went, to, govern, the, empire, s, remote, provinces, moreover, remaining, in, costantinople, she, moved, out, of, the, harem, located, in, the, old, palace, eski, saray, and, permanently, moved, into, the, topkap, palace, after, a, fire, destroyed, the, old, harem, some, sources, say, she, moved, to, topkap, not, because, of, the, fire, but, as, a, result, of, her, marriage, to, suleiman, either, way, this, was, another, significant, break, from, established, customs, as, mehmed, the, conqueror, had, specifically, issued, a, decree, to, the, effect, that, no, women, would, be, allowed, to, reside, in, the, same, building, where, government, affairs, were, conducted, 131, after, h, rrem, resided, at, topkap, it, became, known, as, the, new, palace, saray,

known, as, the, first, woman, in, ottoman, history, to, concern, herself, with, state, affairs, hurrem, sultan, was, able, to, achieve, what, no, concubine, before, her, had, achieved, she, officially, became, suleiman, s, wife, and, although, there, were, no, laws, at, the, time, prohibiting, marriages, between, sultans, and, concubines, the, entire, ottoman, court, was, against, the, marriage, suleiman, had, not, respected, traditions, the, wedding, probably, took, place, in, june, 1533, although, the, exact, date, of, this, event, is, still, unknown, h, rrem, s, position, was, unique, as, was, the, title, of, haseki, suleiman, spent, most, of, his, time, on, military, campaigns, consequently, he, needed, someone, reliable, to, provide, him, with, information, about, the, situation, in, the, palace, he, chose, hurrem, sultan, the, letters, written, by, suleiman, to, h, rrem, have, been, preserved, from, these, emerges, the, great, feeling, of, love, that, the, sultan, felt, for, roxelana, and, the, lack, of, her, that, he, felt, of, her, her, main, political, advisor, and, her, great, haseki, of, her, historical, scholars, note, that, in, the, early, stages, of, his, reign, suleiman, relied, on, correspondence, not, with, haseki, but, with, his, mother, as, h, rrem, did, not, know, the, language, well, enough, in, fact, the, first, letters, to, the, sultan, written, by, h, rrem, contain, bureaucratic, language, which, suggests, that, they, were, written, with, the, help, of, the, court, scribe, thanks, to, her, intelligence, she, acted, as, suleiman, s, chief, adviser, on, matters, of, state, and, seems, to, have, had, an, influence, upon, foreign, policy, and, international, politics, she, frequently, accompanied, him, as, a, political, adviser, she, imprinted, her, seal, and, watched, the, council, meetings, through, a, wire, mesh, window, with, many, other, revolutionary, movements, like, these, she, had, started, an, era, in, ottoman, empire, called, the, sultanate, of, women, h, rrem, s, as, so, significant, that, rumors, circulated, around, the, ottoman, court, that, the, sultan, had, been, bewitched, her, influence, with, suleiman, made, her, one, of, the, most, powerful, women, in, ottoman, history, and, in, the, world, at, that, time, even, as, a, consort, her, power, was, comparable, with, the, most, powerful, woman, of, the, imperial, harem, who, by, tradition, was, the, sultan, s, mother, or, valide, sultan, h, rrem, sultan, was, the, most, powerful, haseki, sultan, because, she, was, the, only, one, who, obtained, the, role, and, power, of, a, valide, sultan, when, she, legally, married, the, sultan, for, this, reason, she, has, become, a, controversial, figure, in, ottoman, history, subject, to, allegations, of, plotting, against, and, manipulating, her, political, rivals, h, rrem, s, influence, in, state, affairs, not, only, made, her, one, of, the, most, influential, women, but, also, a, controversial, figure, in, ottoman, history, especially, in, her, rivalry, with, mahidevran, and, her, son, ehzade, mustafa, and, the, grand, viziers, pargal, ibrahim, pasha, and, kara, ahmed, pasha, h, rrem, and, mahidevran, had, given, birth, to, suleiman, s, six, ehzades, ottoman, princes, mustafa, mehmed, selim, abd, llah, died, at, three, bayezid, and, cihangir, of, these, mahidevran, s, son, mustafa, was, the, eldest, and, preceded, h, rrem, s, children, in, the, order, of, succession, traditionally, when, a, new, sultan, rose, to, power, he, would, order, all, of, his, brothers, killed, in, order, to, ensure, there, was, no, power, struggle, this, practice, was, called, karde, katliam, literally, fraternal, massacring, mustafa, was, supported, by, ibrahim, pasha, who, became, suleiman, s, grand, vizier, in, 1523, h, rrem, has, usually, been, held, at, least, partly, responsible, for, the, intrigues, in, nominating, a, successor, 132, although, she, was, suleiman, s, wife, she, exercised, no, official, public, role, this, did, not, however, prevent, h, rrem, from, wielding, powerful, political, influence, since, the, empire, lacked, until, the, reign, of, ahmed, i, 1603, 1617, any, formal, means, of, nominating, a, successor, successions, usually, involved, the, death, of, competing, princes, in, order, to, avert, civil, unrest, and, rebellions, in, attempting, to, avoid, the, execution, of, her, sons, h, rrem, used, her, influence, to, eliminate, those, who, supported, mustafa, s, accession, to, the, throne, a, skilled, commander, of, suleiman, s, army, ibrahim, eventually, fell, from, grace, after, an, imprudence, committed, during, a, campaign, against, the, persian, safavid, empire, during, the, ottoman, safavid, war, 1532, 55, when, he, awarded, himself, a, title, including, the, word, sultan, another, conflict, occurred, when, ibrahim, and, his, former, mentor, skender, elebi, repeatedly, clashed, over, military, leadership, and, positions, during, the, safavid, war, these, incidents, launched, a, series, of, events, which, culminated, in, his, execution, in, 1536, by, suleiman, s, order, it, is, believed, that, h, rrem, s, influence, contributed, to, suleiman, s, decision, after, three, other, grand, viziers, in, eight, years, suleiman, selected, h, rrem, s, son, in, law, damat, r, stem, pasha, husband, of, mihrimah, to, become, the, grand, vizier, scholars, have, wondered, if, h, rrem, s, alliance, with, mihrimah, sultan, and, r, stem, pasha, helped, secure, the, throne, for, one, of, h, rrem, s, sons, 132, many, years, later, towards, the, end, of, suleiman, s, long, reign, the, rivalry, between, his, sons, became, evident, mustafa, was, later, accused, of, causing, unrest, during, the, campaign, against, safavid, persia, in, 1553, because, of, fear, of, rebellion, suleiman, ordered, the, execution, of, mustafa, according, to, a, source, he, was, executed, that, very, year, on, charges, of, planning, to, dethrone, his, father, his, guilt, for, the, treason, of, which, he, was, accused, remains, neither, proven, nor, disproven, it, is, also, rumored, that, h, rrem, sultan, conspired, against, mustafa, with, the, help, of, her, daughter, and, son, in, law, rustem, pasha, they, wanted, to, portray, mustafa, as, a, traitor, who, secretly, contacted, the, shah, of, iran, acting, on, h, rrem, sultan, s, orders, rustem, pasha, had, engraved, mustafa, s, seal, and, sent, a, letter, seemingly, written, from, his, mouth, to, shah, tahmasb, i, and, then, sent, shah, s, response, to, suleiman, after, the, death, of, mustafa, mahidevran, lost, her, status, in, the, palace, as, the, mother, of, the, heir, apparent, and, moved, to, bursa, she, did, not, spend, her, last, years, in, poverty, as, h, rrem, s, son, selim, ii, the, new, sultan, after, 1566, put, her, on, a, lavish, salary, her, rehabilitation, had, been, possible, after, the, death, of, h, rrem, in, 1558, cihangir, h, rrem, s, youngest, child, allegedly, died, of, grief, a, few, months, after, of, his, half, brother, s, murder, although, the, stories, about, h, rrem, s, role, in, executions, of, ibrahim, mustafa, and, kara, ahmed, are, very, popular, actually, none, of, them, are, based, on, first, hand, sources, all, other, depictions, of, h, rrem, starting, with, comments, by, sixteenth, and, seventeenth, century, ottoman, historians, as, well, as, by, european, diplomats, observers, and, travellers, are, highly, derivative, and, speculative, in, nature, because, none, of, these, people, neither, ottomans, nor, foreign, visitors, were, permitted, into, the, inner, circle, of, the, imperial, harem, which, was, surrounded, by, multiple, walls, they, largely, relied, on, the, testimony, of, the, servants, or, courtiers, or, on, the, popular, gossip, circulating, around, istanbul, even, the, reports, of, the, venetian, ambassadors, baili, at, suleiman, s, court, the, most, extensive, and, objective, first, hand, western, source, on, h, rrem, to, date, were, often, filled, with, the, authors, own, interpretations, of, the, harem, rumours, most, other, sixteenth, century, western, sources, on, h, rrem, which, are, considered, highly, authoritative, today, such, as, turcicae, epistolae, english, the, turkish, letters, of, ogier, de, busbecq, the, emissary, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, ferdinand, i, at, the, porte, between, 1554, and, 1562, the, account, of, the, murder, of, ehzade, mustafa, by, nicholas, de, moffan, the, historical, chronicles, on, turkey, by, paolo, giovio, and, the, travel, narrative, by, luidgi, bassano, derived, from, hearsay, h, rrem, acted, as, suleiman, s, advisor, on, matters, of, state, and, seems, to, have, had, an, influence, upon, foreign, policy, and, on, international, politics, two, of, her, letters, to, king, sigismund, ii, augustus, of, poland, reigned, 1548, 1572, have, survived, and, during, her, lifetime, the, ottoman, empire, generally, had, peaceful, relations, with, the, polish, state, within, a, polish, ottoman, alliance, in, her, first, short, letter, to, sigismund, ii, h, rrem, expresses, her, highest, joy, and, congratulations, to, the, new, king, on, the, occasion, of, his, ascension, to, the, polish, throne, after, the, death, of, his, father, sigismund, i, the, old, in, 1548, there, was, a, seal, on, the, back, of, the, letter, for, the, first, and, only, time, in, the, ottoman, empire, a, female, sultan, exchanged, letters, with, a, king, after, that, although, h, rrem, s, successor, nurbanu, sultan, and, her, successor, safiye, sultan, exchanged, letters, with, queens, there, is, no, other, example, of, a, sultana, who, personally, contacted, a, king, other, than, h, rrem, sultan, she, pleads, with, the, king, to, trust, her, envoy, hassan, a, a, who, took, another, message, from, her, by, word, of, mouth, in, her, second, letter, to, sigismund, augustus, written, in, response, to, his, letter, h, rrem, expresses, in, superlative, terms, her, joy, at, hearing, that, the, king, is, in, good, health, and, that, he, sends, assurances, of, his, sincere, friendliness, and, attachment, towards, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, she, quotes, the, sultan, as, saying, with, the, old, king, we, were, like, brothers, and, if, it, pleases, the, all, merciful, god, with, this, king, we, will, be, as, father, and, son, with, this, letter, hurrem, sent, sigismund, ii, the, gift, of, two, pairs, of, linen, shirts, and, pants, some, belts, six, handkerchiefs, and, a, hand, towel, with, a, promise, to, send, a, special, linen, robe, in, the, future, there, are, reasons, to, believe, that, these, two, letters, were, more, than, just, diplomatic, gestures, and, that, suleiman, s, references, to, brotherly, or, fatherly, feelings, were, not, a, mere, tribute, to, political, expediency, the, letters, also, suggest, h, rrem, s, strong, desire, to, establish, personal, contact, with, the, king, in, his, 1551, letter, to, sigismund, ii, concerning, the, embassy, of, piotr, opali, ski, suleiman, wrote, that, the, ambassador, had, seen, your, sister, and, my, wife, whether, this, phrase,
