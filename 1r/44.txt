parent, though, he, learned, a, great, deal, of, the, art, of, performing, from, him, as, a, young, man, gerard, olivier, had, considered, a, stage, career, and, was, a, dramatic, and, effective, preacher, olivier, wrote, that, his, father, knew, when, to, drop, the, voice, when, to, bellow, about, the, perils, of, hellfire, when, to, slip, in, a, gag, when, suddenly, to, wax, sentimental, the, quick, changes, of, mood, and, manner, absorbed, me, and, i, have, never, forgotten, them, in, 1916, after, attending, a, series, of, preparatory, schools, olivier, passed, the, singing, examination, for, admission, to, the, choir, school, of, all, saints, margaret, street, in, central, london, his, elder, brother, was, already, a, pupil, and, olivier, gradually, settled, in, though, he, felt, himself, to, be, something, of, an, outsider, the, church, s, style, of, worship, was, and, remains, anglo, catholic, with, emphasis, on, ritual, vestments, and, incense, the, theatricality, of, the, services, appealed, to, olivier, and, the, vicar, encouraged, the, students, to, develop, a, taste, for, secular, as, well, as, religious, drama, in, a, school, production, of, julius, caesar, in, 1917, the, ten, year, old, olivier, s, performance, as, brutus, impressed, an, audience, that, included, lady, tree, the, young, sybil, thorndike, and, ellen, terry, who, wrote, in, her,

in, the, school, s, production, of, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, his, performance, was, a, tour, de, force, that, won, him, popularity, among, his, fellow, pupils, in, january, 1924, his, brother, left, england, to, work, in, india, as, a, rubber, planter, olivier, missed, him, greatly, and, asked, his, father, how, soon, he, could, follow, he, recalled, in, his, memoirs, that, his, father, replied, don, t, be, such, a, fool, you, re, not, going, to, india, you, re, going, on, the, stage, in, 1924, gerard, olivier, a, habitually, frugal, man, told, his, son, that, he, must, gain, not, only, admission, to, the, central, school, of, speech, training, and, dramatic, art, but, also, a, scholarship, with, a, bursary, to, cover, his, tuition, fees, and, living, expenses, olivier, s, sister, had, been, a, student, there, and, was, a, favourite, of, elsie, fogerty, the, founder, and, principal, of, the, school, olivier, later, speculated, that, it, was, on, the, strength, of, this, connection, that, fogerty, agreed, to, award, him, the, bursary, one, of, olivier, s, contemporaries, at, the, school, was, peggy, ashcroft, who, observed, he, was, rather, uncouth, in, that, his, sleeves, were, too, short, and, his, hair, stood, on, end, but, he, was, intensely, lively, and, great, fun, by, his, own, admission, he, was, not, a, very, conscientious, student, but, fogerty, liked, him, and, later, said, that, he, and, ashcroft, stood, out, among, her, many, pupils, after, leaving, the, central, school, in, 1925, olivier, worked, for, small, theatrical, companies, his, first, stage, appearance, was, in, a, sketch, called, the, unfailing, instinct, at, the, brighton, hippodrome, in, august, 1925, later, that, year, he, was, taken, on, by, sybil, thorndike, the, daughter, of, a, friend, of, olivier, s, father, and, her, husband, lewis, casson, as, a, bit, part, player, understudy, and, assistant, stage, manager, for, their, london, company, olivier, modelled, his, performing, style, on, that, of, gerald, du, maurier, of, whom, he, said, he, seemed, to, mutter, on, stage, but, had, such, perfect, technique, when, i, started, i, was, so, busy, doing, a, du, maurier, that, no, one, ever, heard, a, word, i, said, the, shakespearean, actors, one, saw, were, terrible, hams, like, frank, benson, olivier, s, concern, with, speaking, naturally, and, avoiding, what, he, called, singing, shakespeare, s, verse, was, the, cause, of, much, frustration, in, his, early, career, as, critics, regularly, decried, his, delivery, in, 1926, on, thorndike, s, recommendation, olivier, joined, the, birmingham, repertory, company, his, biographer, michael, billington, describes, the, birmingham, company, as, olivier, s, university, where, in, his, second, year, he, was, given, the, chance, to, play, a, wide, range, of, important, roles, including, tony, lumpkin, in, she, stoops, to, conquer, the, title, role, in, uncle, vanya, and, parolles, in, all, s, well, that, ends, well, billington, adds, that, the, engagement, led, to, a, lifelong, friendship, with, his, fellow, actor, ralph, richardson, that, was, to, have, a, decisive, effect, on, the, british, theatre, while, playing, the, juvenile, lead, in, bird, in, hand, at, the, royalty, theatre, in, june, 1928, olivier, began, a, relationship, with, jill, esmond, the, daughter, of, the, actors, henry, v, esmond, and, eva, moore, olivier, later, recounted, that, he, thought, she, would, most, certainly, do, excellent, well, for, a, wife, i, wasn, t, likely, to, do, any, better, at, my, age, and, with, my, undistinguished, track, record, so, i, promptly, fell, in, love, with, her, in, 1928, olivier, created, the, role, of, stanhope, in, r, c, sherriff, s, journey, s, end, in, which, he, scored, a, great, success, at, its, single, sunday, night, premiere, he, was, offered, the, part, in, the, west, end, production, the, following, year, but, turned, it, down, in, favour, of, the, more, glamorous, role, of, beau, geste, in, a, stage, adaptation, of, p, c, wren, s, 1929, novel, of, the, same, name, journey, s, end, became, a, long, running, success, beau, geste, failed, the, manchester, guardian, commented, mr, laurence, olivier, did, his, best, as, beau, but, he, deserves, and, will, get, better, parts, mr, olivier, is, going, to, make, a, big, name, for, himself, for, the, rest, of, 1929, olivier, appeared, in, seven, plays, all, of, which, were, short, lived, billington, ascribes, this, failure, rate, to, poor, choices, by, olivier, rather, than, mere, bad, luck, in, 1930, with, his, impending, marriage, in, mind, olivier, earned, some, extra, money, with, small, roles, in, two, films, in, april, he, travelled, to, berlin, to, film, the, english, language, version, of, the, temporary, widow, a, crime, comedy, with, lilian, harvey, and, in, may, he, spent, four, nights, working, on, another, comedy, too, many, crooks, during, work, on, the, latter, film, for, which, he, was, paid, 60, he, met, laurence, evans, who, became, his, personal, manager, olivier, did, not, enjoy, working, in, film, which, he, dismissed, as, this, anaemic, little, medium, which, could, not, stand, great, acting, but, financially, it, was, much, more, rewarding, than, his, theatre, work, olivier, and, esmond, married, on, 25, july, 1930, at, all, saints, margaret, street, although, within, weeks, both, realised, they, had, erred, olivier, later, recorded, that, the, marriage, was, a, pretty, crass, mistake, i, insisted, on, getting, married, from, a, pathetic, mixture, of, religious, and, animal, promptings, she, had, admitted, to, me, that, she, was, in, love, elsewhere, and, could, never, love, me, as, completely, as, i, would, wish, olivier, later, recounted, that, following, the, wedding, he, did, not, keep, a, diary, for, ten, years, and, never, followed, religious, practices, again, although, he, considered, those, facts, to, be, mere, coincidence, unconnected, to, the, nuptials, in, 1930, no, l, coward, cast, olivier, as, victor, prynne, in, his, new, play, private, lives, which, opened, at, the, new, phoenix, theatre, in, london,

extra, puppets, lightly, wooden, ninepins, only, to, be, repeatedly, knocked, down, and, stood, up, again, to, make, them, credible, spouses, for, amanda, and, elyot, coward, was, determined, that, two, outstandingly, attractive, performers, should, play, the, parts, olivier, played, victor, in, the, west, end, and, then, on, broadway, adrianne, allen, was, sybil, in, london, but, could, not, go, to, new, york, where, the, part, was, taken, by, esmond, in, addition, to, giving, the, 23, year, old, olivier, his, first, successful, west, end, role, coward, became, something, of, a, mentor, in, the, late, 1960s, olivier, told, sheridan, morley, he, gave, me, a, sense, of, balance, of, right, and, wrong, he, would, make, me, read, i, never, used, to, read, anything, at, all, i, remember, he, said, right, my, boy, wuthering, heights, of, human, bondage, and, the, old, wives, tale, by, arnold, bennett, that, ll, do, those, are, three, of, the, best, read, them, i, did, no, l, also, did, a, priceless, thing, he, taught, me, not, to, giggle, on, the, stage, once, already, i, d, been, fired, for, doing, it, and, i, was, very, nearly, sacked, from, the, birmingham, rep, for, the, same, reason, no, l, cured, me, by, trying, to, make, me, laugh, outrageously, he, taught, me, how, not, to, give, in, to, it, my, great, triumph, came, in, new, york, when, one, night, i, managed, to, break, no, l, up, on, the, stage, without, giggling, myself, in, 1931, rko, pictures, offered, olivier, a, two, film, contract, at, 1, 000, a, week, he, discussed, the, possibility, with, coward, who, irked, told, olivier, you, ve, no, artistic, integrity, that, s, your, trouble, this, is, how, you, cheapen, yourself, he, accepted, and, moved, to, hollywood, despite, some, misgivings, his, first, film, was, the, drama, friends, and, lovers, in, a, supporting, role, before, rko, loaned, him, to, fox, studios, for, his, first, film, lead, a, british, journalist, in, a, russia, under, martial,

westward, passage, which, was, a, commercial, failure, olivier, s, initial, foray, into, american, films, had, not, provided, the, breakthrough, he, hoped, for, disillusioned, with, hollywood, he, returned, to, london, where, he, appeared, in, two, british, films, perfect, understanding, with, gloria, swanson, and, no, funny, business, in, which, esmond, also, appeared, he, was, tempted, back, to, hollywood, in, 1933, to, appear, opposite, greta, garbo, in, queen, christina, but, was, replaced, after, two, weeks, of, filming, because, of, a, lack, of, chemistry, between, the, two, olivier, s, stage, roles, in, 1934, included, bothwell, in, gordon, daviot, s, queen, of, scots, which, was, only, a, moderate, success, for, him, and, for, the, play, but, led, to, an, important, engagement, for, the, same, management, bronson, albery, shortly, afterwards, in, the, interim, he, had, a, great, success, playing, a, thinly, disguised, version, of, the, american, actor, john, barrymore, in, george, s, kaufman, and, edna, ferber, s, theatre, royal, his, success, was, vitiated, by, his, breaking, an, ankle, two, months, into, the, run, in, one, of, the, athletic, acrobatic, stunts, with, which, he, liked, to, enliven, his, performances, mr, olivier, was, about, twenty, times, as, much, in, love, with, peggy, ashcroft, as, mr, gielgud, is, but, mr, gielgud, spoke, most, of, the, poetry, far, better, than, mr, olivier, yet, i, must, out, with, it, the, fire, of, mr, olivier, s, passion, carried, the, play, along, as, mr, gielgud, s, doesn, t, quite, herbert, farjeon, on, the,

seen, olivier, in, queen, of, scots, spotted, his, potential, and, gave, him, a, major, step, up, in, his, career, for, the, first, weeks, of, the, run, gielgud, played, mercutio, and, olivier, played, romeo, after, which, they, exchanged, roles, the, production, broke, all, box, office, records, for, the, play, running, for, 189, performances, olivier, was, enraged, at, the, notices, after, the, first, night, which, praised, the, virility, of, his, performance, but, fiercely, criticised, his, speaking, of, shakespeare, s, verse, contrasting, it, with, his, co, star, s, mastery, of, the, poetry, the, friendship, between, the, two, men, was, prickly, on, olivier, s, side, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, may, 1936, olivier, and, richardson, jointly, directed, and, starred, in, a, new, piece, by, j, b, priestley, bees, on, the, boatdeck, both, actors, won, excellent, notices, but, the, play, an, allegory, of, britain, s, decay, did, not, attract, the, public, and, closed, after, four, weeks, later, in, the, same, year, olivier, accepted, an, invitation, to, join, the, old, vic, company, the, theatre, in, an, unfashionable, location, south, of, the, thames, had, offered, inexpensive, tickets, for, opera, and, drama, under, its, proprietor, lilian, baylis, since, 1912, her, drama, company, specialised, in, the, plays, of, shakespeare, and, many, leading, actors, had, taken, very, large, cuts, in, their, pay, to, develop, their, shakespearean, techniques, there, gielgud, had, been, in, the, company, from, 1929, to, 1931, and, richardson, from, 1930, to, 1932, among, the, actors, whom, olivier, joined, in, late, 1936, were, edith, evans, ruth, gordon, alec, guinness, and, michael, redgrave, in, january, 1937, olivier, took, the, title, role, in, an, uncut, version, of, hamlet, in, which, once, again, his, delivery, of, the, verse, was, unfavourably, compared, with, that, of, gielgud, who, had, played, the, role, on, the, same, stage, seven, years, previously, to, enormous, acclaim, the, observer, s, ivor, brown, praised, olivier, s, magnetism, and, muscularity, but, missed, the, kind, of, pathos, so, richly, established, by, mr, gielgud, the, reviewer, in, the, times, found, the, performance, full, of, vitality, but, at, times, too, light, the, character, slips, from, mr, olivier, s, grasp, after, hamlet, the, company, presented, twelfth, night, in, what, the, director, tyrone, guthrie, summed, up, as, a, baddish, immature, production, of, mine, with, olivier, outrageously, amusing, as, sir, toby, and, a, very, young, alec, guinness, outrageous, and, more, amusing, as, sir, andrew, henry, v, was, the, next, play, presented, in, may, to, mark, the, coronation, of, george, vi, a, pacifist, as, he, then, was, olivier, was, as, reluctant, to, play, the, warrior, king, as, guthrie, was, to, direct, the, piece, but, the, production, was, a, success, and, baylis, had, to, extend, the, run, from, four, to, eight, weeks, following, olivier, s, success, in, shakespearean, stage, productions, he, made, his, first, foray, into, shakespeare, on, film, in, 1936, as, orlando, in, as, you, like, it, directed, by, paul, czinner, a, charming, if, lightweight, production, according, to, michael, brooke, of, the, british, film, institute, s, bfi, s, screenonline, the, following, year, olivier, appeared, alongside, vivien, leigh, in, the, historical, drama, fire, over, england, he, had, first, met, leigh, briefly, at, the, savoy, grill, and, then, again, when, she, visited, him, during, the, run, of, romeo, and, juliet, probably, early, in, 1936, and, the, two, had, begun, an, affair, sometime, that, year, of, the, relationship, olivier, later, said, that, i, couldn, t, help, myself, with, vivien, no, man, could, i, hated, myself, for, cheating, on, jill, but, then, i, had, cheated, before, but, this, was, something, different, this, wasn, t, just, out, of, lust, this, was, love, that, i, really, didn, t, ask, for, but, was, drawn, into, while, his, relationship, with, leigh, continued, he, conducted, an, affair, with, the, actress, ann, todd, and, possibly, had, a, brief, affair, with, the, actor, henry, ainley, according, to, the, biographer, michael, munn, in, june, 1937, the, old, vic, company, took, up, an, invitation, to, perform, hamlet, in, the, courtyard, of, the, castle, at, elsinore, where, shakespeare, located, the, play, olivier, secured, the, casting, of, leigh, to, replace, cherry, cottrell, as, ophelia, because, of, torrential, rain, the, performance, had, to, be, moved, from, the, castle, courtyard, to, the, ballroom, of, a, local, hotel, but, the, tradition, of, playing, hamlet, at, elsinore, was, established, and, olivier, was, followed, by, among, others, gielgud, 1939, redgrave, 1950, richard, burton, 1954, christopher, plummer, 1964, derek, jacobi, 1979, kenneth, branagh, 1988, and, jude, law, 2009, back, in, london, the, company, staged, macbeth, with, olivier, in, the, title, role, the, stylised, production, by, michel, saint, denis, was, not, well, liked, but, olivier, had, some, good, notices, among, the, bad, on, returning, from, denmark, olivier, and, leigh, told, their, respective, spouses, about, the, affair, and, that, their, marriages, were, over, esmond, moved, out, of, the, marital, house, and, in, with, her, mother, after, olivier, and, leigh, made, a, tour, of, europe, in, mid, 1937, they, returned, to, separate, film, projects, a, yank, at, oxford, for, her, and, the, divorce, of, lady, x, for, him, and, moved, into, a, property, together, in, iver, buckinghamshire, olivier, returned, to, the, old, vic, for, a, second, season, in, 1938, for, othello, he, played, iago, with, richardson, in, the, title, role, guthrie, wanted, to, experiment, with, the, theory, that, iago, s, villainy, is, driven, by, a, suppressed, love, for, othello, olivier, was, willing, to, co, operate, but, richardson, was, not, audiences, and, most, critics, failed, to, spot, the, supposed, motivation, of, olivier, s, iago, and, richardson, s, othello, seemed, underpowered, after, that, comparative, failure, the, company, had, a, success, with, coriolanus, starring, olivier, in, the, title, role, the, notices, were, laudatory, mentioning, him, alongside, great, predecessors, such, as, edmund, kean, william, macready, and, henry, irving, the, actor, robert, speaight, described, it, as, olivier, s, first, incontestably, great, performance, this, was, olivier, s, last, appearance, on, a, london, stage, for, six, years, in, 1938, olivier, joined, richardson, to, film, the, spy, thriller, q, planes, released, the, following, year, frank, nugent, the, critic, for, the, new, york, times, thought, olivier, was, not, quite, so, good, as, richardson, but, was, quite, acceptable, in, late, 1938, lured, by, a, salary, of, 50, 000, the, actor, travelled, to, hollywood, to, take, the, part, of, heathcliff, in, the, 1939, film, wuthering, heights, alongside, merle, oberon, and, david, niven, in, less, than, a, month, leigh, had, joined, him, explaining, that, her, trip, was, partially, because, larry, s, there, and, partially, because, i, intend, to, get, the, part, of, scarlett, o, hara, the, role, in, gone, with, the, wind, in, which, she, was, eventually, cast, olivier, did, not, enjoy, making, wuthering, heights, and, his, approach, to, film, acting, combined, with, a, dislike, for, oberon, led, to, tensions, on, set, the, director, william, wyler, was, a, hard, taskmaster, and, olivier, learned, to, remove, what, billington, described, as, the, carapace, of, theatricality, to, which, he, was, prone, replacing, it, with, a, palpable, reality, the, resulting, film, was, a, commercial, and, critical, success, that, earned, him, a, nomination, for, the, academy, award, for, best, actor, and, created, his, screen, reputation, caroline, lejeune, writing, for, the, observer, considered, that, olivier, s, dark, moody, face, abrupt, style, and, a, certain, fine, arrogance, towards, the, world, in, his, playing, are, just, right, in, the, role, while, the, reviewer, for, the, times, wrote, that, olivier, is, a, good, embodiment, of, heathcliff, impressive, enough, on, a, more, human, plane, speaking, his, lines, with, real, distinction, and, always, both, romantic, and, alive, after, returning, to, london, briefly, in, mid, 1939, the, couple, returned, to, america, leigh, to, film, the, final, takes, for, gone, with, the, wind, and, olivier, to, prepare, for, filming, of, alfred, hitchcock, s, rebecca, although, the, couple, had, hoped, to, appear, in, it, together, instead, joan, fontaine, was, selected, for, the, role, of, mrs, de, winter, as, the, producer, david, o, selznick, thought, that, not, only, was, she, more, suitable, for, the, role, but, that, it, was, best, to, keep, olivier, and, leigh, apart, until, their, divorces, came, through, olivier, followed, rebecca, with, pride, and, prejudice, in, the, role, of, mr, darcy, to, his, disappointment, elizabeth, bennet, was, played, by, greer, garson, rather, than, leigh, he, received, good, reviews, for, both, films, and, showed, a, more, confident, screen, presence, than, he, had, in, his, early, work, in, january, 1940, olivier, and, esmond, were, granted, their, divorce, in, february, following, another, request, from, leigh, her, husband, also, applied, for, their, marriage, to, be, terminated, on, stage, olivier, and, leigh, starred, in, romeo, and, juliet, on, broadway, it, was, an, extravagant, production, but, a, commercial, failure, in, the, new, york, times, brooks, atkinson, praised, the, scenery, but, not, the, acting, although, miss, leigh, and, mr, olivier, are, handsome, young, people, they, hardly, act, their, parts, at, all, the, couple, had, invested, almost, all, their, savings, in, the, project, and, its, failure, was, a, grave, financial, blow, they, were, married, in, august, 1940, at, the, san, ysidro, ranch, in, santa, barbara, the, war, in, europe, had, been, under, way, for, a, year, and, was, going, badly, for, britain, after, his, wedding, olivier, wanted, to, help, the, war, effort, he, telephoned, duff, cooper, the, minister, of, information, under, winston, churchill, hoping, to, get, a, position, in, cooper, s, department, cooper, advised, him, to, remain, where, he, was, and, speak, to, the, film, director, alexander, korda, who, was, based, in, the, us, at, churchill, s, behest, with, connections, to, british, intelligence, korda, with, churchill, s, support, and, involvement, directed, that, hamilton, woman, with, olivier, as, horatio, nelson, and, leigh, in, the, title, role, korda, saw, that, the, relationship, between, the, couple, was, strained, olivier, was, tiring, of, leigh, s, suffocating, adulation, and, she, was, drinking, to, excess, the, film, in, which, the, threat, of, napoleon, paralleled, that, of, hitler, was, seen, by, critics, as, bad, history, but, good, british, propaganda, according, to, the, bfi, olivier, s, life, was, under, threat, from, the, nazis, and, pro, german, sympathisers, the, studio, owners, were, concerned, enough, that, samuel, goldwyn, and, cecil, b, demille, both, provided, support, and, security, to, ensure, his, safety, on, the, completion, of, filming, olivier, and, leigh, returned, to, britain, he, had, spent, the, previous, year, learning, to, fly, and, had, completed, nearly, 250, hours, by, the, time, he, left, america, he, intended, to, join, the, royal, air, force, but, instead, made, another, propaganda, film, 49th, parallel, narrated, short, pieces, for, the, ministry, of, information, and, joined, the, fleet, air, arm, because, richardson, was, already, in, the, service, richardson, had, gained, a, reputation, for, crashing, aircraft, which, olivier, rapidly, eclipsed, olivier, and, leigh, settled, in, a, cottage, just, outside, rnas, worthy, down, where, he, was, stationed, with, a, training, squadron, no, l, coward, visited, the, couple, and, thought, olivier, looked, unhappy, olivier, spent, much, of, his, time, taking, part, in, broadcasts, and, making, speeches, to, build, morale, and, in, 1942, he, was, invited, to, make, another, propaganda, film, the, demi, paradise, in, which, he, played, a, soviet, engineer, who, helps, improve, british, russian, relationships, in, 1943, at, the, behest, of, the, ministry, of, information, olivier, began, working, on, henry, v, originally, he, had, no, intention, of, taking, the, directorial, duties, but, ended, up, directing, and, producing, in, addition, to, taking, the, title, role, he, was, assisted, by, an, italian, internee, filippo, del, giudice, who, had, been, released, to, produce, propaganda, for, the, allied, cause, the, decision, was, made, to, film, the, battle, scenes, in, neutral, ireland, where, it, was, easier, to, find, the, 650, extras, john,

britain, was, defending, the, music, for, the, film, was, written, by, william, walton, a, score, that, ranks, with, the, best, in, film, music, according, to, the, music, critic, michael, kennedy, walton, also, provided, the, music, for, olivier, s, next, two, shakespearean, adaptations, hamlet, 1948, and, richard, iii, 1955, henry, v, was, warmly, received, by, critics, the, reviewer, for, the, manchester, guardian, wrote, that, the, film, combined, new, art, hand, in, hand, with, old, genius, and, both, superbly, of, one, mind, in, a, film, that, worked, triumphantly, the, critic, for, the, times, considered, that, olivier, plays, henry, on, a, high, heroic, note, and, never, is, there, danger, of, a, crack, in, a, film, described, as, a, triumph, of, film, craft, there, were, oscar, nominations, for, the, film, including, best, picture, and, best, actor, but, it, won, none, and, olivier, was, instead, presented, with, a, special, award, he, was, unimpressed, and, later, commented, that, this, was, my, first, absolute, fob, off, and, i, regarded, it, as, such, throughout, the, war, tyrone, guthrie, had, striven, to, keep, the, old, vic, company, going, even, after, german, bombing, in, 1942, left, the, theatre, a, near, ruin, a, small, troupe, toured, the, provinces, with, sybil, thorndike, at, its, head, by, 1944, with, the, tide, of, the, war, turning, guthrie, felt, it, time, to, re, establish, the, company, in, a, london, base, and, invited, richardson, to, head, it, richardson, made, it, a, condition, of, accepting, that, he, should, share, the, acting, and, management, in, a, triumvirate, initially, he, proposed, gielgud, and, olivier, as, his, colleagues, but, the, former, declined, saying, it, would, be, a, disaster, you, would, have, to, spend, your, whole, time, as, referee, between, larry, and, me, it, was, finally, agreed, that, the, third, member, would, be, the, stage, director, john, burrell, the, old, vic, governors, approached, the, royal, navy, to, secure, the, release, of, richardson, and, olivier, the, sea, lords, consented, with, as, olivier, put, it, a, speediness, and, lack, of, reluctance, which, was, positively, hurtful, the, triumvirate, secured, the, new, theatre, for, their, first, season, and, recruited, a, company, thorndike, was, joined, by, among, others, harcourt, williams, joyce, redman, and, margaret, leighton, it, was, agreed, to, open, with, a, repertory, of, four, plays, peer, gynt, arms, and, the, man, richard, iii, and, uncle, vanya, olivier, s, roles, were, the, button, moulder, sergius, richard, and, astrov, richardson, played, peer, bluntschli, richmond, and, vanya, the, first, three, productions, met, with, acclaim, from, reviewers, and, audiences, uncle, vanya, had, a, mixed, reception, although, the, times, thought, olivier, s, astrov, a, most, distinguished, portrait, and, richardson, s, vanya, the, perfect, compound, of, absurdity, and, pathos, in, richard, iii, according, to, billington, olivier, s, triumph, was, absolute, so, much, so, that, it, became, his, most, frequently, imitated, performance, and, one, whose, supremacy, went, unchallenged, until, antony, sher, played, the, role, forty, years, later, in, 1945, the, company, toured, germany, where, they, were, seen, by, many, thousands, of, allied, servicemen, they, also, appeared, at, the, com, die, fran, aise, theatre, in, paris, the, first, foreign, company, to, be, given, that, honour, the, critic, harold, hobson, wrote, that, richardson, and, olivier, quickly, made, the, old, vic, the, most, famous, theatre, in, the, anglo, saxon, world, the, second, season, in, 1945, featured, two, double, bills, the, first, consisted, of, henry, iv, parts, 1, and, 2, olivier, played, the, warrior, hotspur, in, the, first, and, the, doddering, justice, shallow, in, the, second, he, received, good, notices, but, by, general, consent, the, production, belonged, to, richardson, as, falstaff, in, the, second, double, bill, it, was, olivier, who, dominated, in, the, title, roles, of, oedipus, rex, and, the, critic, in, the, two, one, act, plays, his, switch, from, searing, tragedy, and, horror, in, the, first, half, to, farcical, comedy, in, the, second, impressed, most, critics, and, audience, members, though, a, minority, felt, that, the, transformation, from, sophocles, s, bloodily, blinded, hero, to, sheridan, s, vain, and, ludicrous, mr, puff, smacked, of, a, quick, change, turn, in, a, music, hall, after, the, london, season, the, company, played, both, the, double, bills, and, uncle, vanya, in, a, six, week, run, on, broadway, the, third, and, final, london, season, under, the, triumvirate, was, in, 1946, 47, olivier, played, king, lear, and, richardson, took, the, title, role, in, cyrano, de, bergerac, olivier, would, have, preferred, the, roles, to, be, reversed, but, richardson, did, not, wish, to, attempt, lear, olivier, s, lear, received, good, but, not, outstanding, reviews, in, his, scenes, of, decline, and, madness, towards, the, end, of, the, play, some, critics, found, him, less, moving, than, his, finest, predecessors, in, the, role, the, influential, critic, james, agate, suggested, that, olivier, used, his, dazzling, stage, technique, to, disguise, a, lack, of, feeling, a, charge, that, the, actor, strongly, rejected, but, which, was, often, made, throughout, his, later, career, during, the, run, of, cyrano, richardson, was, knighted, to, olivier, s, undisguised, envy, the, younger, man, received, the, accolade, six, months, later, by, which, time, the, days, of, the, triumvirate, were, numbered, the, high, profile, of, the, two, star, actors, did, not, endear, them, to, the, new, chairman, of, the, old, vic, governors, lord, esher, he, had, ambitions, to, be, the, first, head, of, the, national, theatre, and, had, no, intention, of, letting, actors, run, it, he, was, encouraged, by, guthrie, who, having, instigated, the, appointment, of, richardson, and, olivier, had, come, to, resent, their, knighthoods, and, international, fame, in, january, 1947, olivier, began, working, on, his, second, film, as, a, director, hamlet, 1948, in, which, he, also, took, the, lead, role, the, original, play, was, heavily, cut, to, focus, on, the, relationships, rather, than, the, political, intrigue, the, film, became, a, critical, and, commercial, success, in, britain, and, abroad, although, lejeune, in, the, observer, considered, it, less, effective, than, stage, work, he, speaks, the, lines, nobly, and, with, the, caress, of, one, who, loves, them, but, he, nullifies, his, own, thesis, by, never, for, a, moment, leaving, the, impression, of, a, man, who, cannot, make, up, his, own, mind, here, you, feel, rather, is, an, actor, producer, director, who, in, every, circumstance, knows, exactly, what, he, wants, and, gets, it, campbell, dixon, the, critic, for, the, daily, telegraph, thought, the, film, brilliant, one, of, the, masterpieces, of, the, stage, has, been, made, into, one, of, the, greatest, of, films, hamlet, became, the, first, non, american, film, to, win, the, academy, award, for, best, picture, while, olivier, won, the, award, for, best, actor, in, 1948, olivier, led, the, old, vic, company, on, a, six, month, tour, of, australia, and, new, zealand, he, played, richard, iii, sir, peter, teazle, in, sheridan, s, the, school, for, scandal, and, antrobus, in, thornton, wilder, s, the, skin, of, our, teeth, appearing, alongside, leigh, in, the, latter, two, plays, while, olivier, was, on, the, australian, tour, and, richardson, was, in, hollywood, esher, terminated, the, contracts, of, the, three, directors, who, were, said, to, have, resigned, melvyn, bragg, in, a, 1984, study, of, olivier, and, john, miller, in, the, authorised, biography, of, richardson, both, comment, that, esher, s, action, put, back, the, establishment, of, a, national, theatre, for, at, least, a, decade, looking, back, in, 1971, bernard, levin, wrote, that, the, old, vic, company, of, 1944, to, 1948, was, probably, the, most, illustrious, that, has, ever, been, assembled, in, this, country, the, times, said, that, the, triumvirate, s, years, were, the, greatest, in, the, old, vic, s, history, as, the, guardian, put, it, the, governors, summarily, sacked, them, in, the, interests, of, a, more, mediocre, company, spirit, by, the, end, of, the, australian, tour, both, leigh, and, olivier, were, exhausted, and, ill, and, he, told, a, journalist, you, may, not, know, it, but, you, are, talking, to, a, couple, of, walking, corpses, later, he, would, comment, that, he, lost, vivien, in, australia, a, reference, to, leigh, s, affair, with, the, australian, actor, peter, finch, whom, the, couple, met, during, the, tour, shortly, afterwards, finch, moved, to, london, where, olivier, auditioned, him, and, put, him, under, a, long, term, contract, with, laurence, olivier, productions, finch, and, leigh, s, affair, continued, on, and, off, for, several, years, although, it, was, common, knowledge, that, the, old, vic, triumvirate, had, been, dismissed, they, refused, to, be, drawn, on, the, matter, in, public, and, olivier, even, arranged, to, play, a, final, london, season, with, the, company, in, 1949, as, richard, iii, sir, peter, teazle, and, chorus, in, his, own, production, of, anouilh, s, antigone, with, leigh, in, the, title, role, after, that, he, was, free, to, embark, on, a, new, career, as, an, actor, manager, in, partnership, with, binkie, beaumont, he, staged, the, english, premiere, of, tennessee, williams, s, a, streetcar, named, desire, with, leigh, in, the, central, role, of, blanche, dubois, the, play, was, condemned, by, most, critics, but, the, production, was, a, considerable, commercial, success, and, led, to, leigh, s, casting, as, blanche, in, the, 1951, film, version, gielgud, who, was, a, devoted, friend, of, leigh, s, doubted, whether, olivier, was, wise, to, let, her, play, the, demanding, role, of, the, mentally, unstable, heroine, was, so, very, like, her, in, a, way, it, must, have, been, a, most, dreadful, strain, to, do, it, night, after, night, she, would, be, shaking, and, white, and, quite, distraught, at, the, end, of, it, i, think, i, m, a, fairly, good, manager, now, i, ran, the, st, james, s, theatre, for, eight, years, i, didn, t, run, that, at, all, well, i, made, mistake, after, mistake, but, i, dare, say, those, mistakes, taught, me, something, olivier, talking, to, kenneth, tynan, in, 1966, the, production, company, set, up, by, olivier, took, a, lease, on, the, st, james, s, theatre, in, january, 1950, he, produced, directed, and, starred, in, christopher, fry, s, verse, play, venus, observed, the, production, was, popular, despite, poor, reviews, but, the, expensive, production, did, little, to, help, the, finances, of, laurence, olivier, productions, after, a, series, of, box, office, failures, the, company, balanced, its, books, in, 1951, with, productions, of, shaw, s, caesar, and, cleopatra, and, shakespeare, s, antony, and, cleopatra, which, the, oliviers, played, in, london, and, then, took, to, broadway, olivier, was, thought, by, some, critics, to, be, under, par, in, both, his, roles, and, some, suspected, him, of, playing, deliberately, below, his, usual, strength, so, that, leigh, might, appear, his, equal, olivier, dismissed, the, suggestion, regarding, it, as, an, insult, to, his, integrity, as, an, actor, in, the, view, of, the, critic, and, biographer, w, a, darlington, he, was, simply, miscast, both, as, caesar, and, antony, finding, the, former, boring, and, the, latter, weak, darlington, comments, olivier, in, his, middle, forties, when, he, should, have, been, displaying, his, powers, at, their, very, peak, seemed, to, have, lost, interest, in, his, own, acting, over, the, next, four, years, olivier, spent, much, of, his, time, working, as, a, producer, presenting, plays, rather, than, directing, or, acting, in, them, his, presentations, at, the, st, james, s, included, seasons, by, ruggero, ruggeri, s, company, giving, two, pirandello, plays, in, italian, followed, by, a, visit, from, the, com, die, fran, aise, playing, works, by, moli, re, racine, marivaux, and, musset, in, french, darlington, considers, a, 1951, production, of, othello, starring, orson, welles, as, the, pick, of, olivier, s, productions, at, the, theatre, while, leigh, made, streetcar, in, 1951, olivier, joined, her, in, hollywood, to, film, carrie, based, on, the, controversial, novel, sister, carrie, although, the, film, was, plagued, by, troubles, olivier, received, warm, reviews, and, a, bafta, nomination, olivier, began, to, notice, a, change, in, leigh, s, behaviour, and, he, later, recounted, that, i, would, find, vivien, sitting, on, the, corner, of, the, bed, wringing, her, hands, and, sobbing, in, a, state, of, grave, distress, i, would, naturally, try, desperately, to, give, her, some, comfort, but, for, some, time, she, would, be, inconsolable, after, a, holiday, with, coward, in, jamaica, she, seemed, to, have, recovered, but, olivier, later, recorded, i, am, sure, that, must, have, taken, some, pains, to, tell, me, what, was, wrong, with, my, wife, that, her, disease, was, called, manic, depression, and, what, that, meant, a, possibly, permanent, cyclical, to, and, fro, between, the, depths, of, depression, and, wild, uncontrollable, mania, he, also, recounted, the, years, of, problems, he, had, experienced, because, of, leigh, s, illness, writing, throughout, her, possession, by, that, uncannily, evil, monster, manic, depression, with, its, deadly, ever, tightening, spirals, she, retained, her, own, individual, canniness, an, ability, to, disguise, her, true, mental, condition, from, almost, all, except, me, for, whom, she, could, hardly, be, expected, to, take, the, trouble, in, january, 1953, leigh, travelled, to, ceylon, now, sri, lanka, to, film, elephant, walk, with, peter, finch, shortly, after, filming, started, she, suffered, a, breakdown, and, returned, to, britain, where, between, periods, of, incoherence, she, told, olivier, that, she, was, in, love, with, finch, and, had, been, having, an, affair, with, him, she, gradually, recovered, over, a, period, of, several, months, as, a, result, of, the, breakdown, many, of, the, oliviers, friends, learned, of, her, problems, niven, said, she, had, been, quite, quite, mad, and, in, his, diary, coward, expressed, the, view, that, things, had, been, bad, and, getting, worse, since, 1948, or, thereabouts, for, the, coronation, season, of, 1953, olivier, and, leigh, starred, in, the, west, end, in, terence, rattigan, s, ruritanian, comedy, the, sleeping, prince, it, ran, for, eight, months, but, was, widely, regarded, as, a, minor, contribution, to, the, season, in, which, other, productions, included, gielgud, in, venice, preserv, d, coward, in, the, apple, cart, and, ashcroft, and, redgrave, in, antony, and, cleopatra, olivier, directed, his, third, shakespeare, film, in, september, 1954, richard, iii, 1955, which, he, co, produced, with, korda, the, presence, of, four, theatrical, knights, in, the, one, film, olivier, was, joined, by, cedric, hardwicke, gielgud, and, richardson, led, an, american, reviewer, to, dub, it, an, all, sir, cast, the, critic, for, the, manchester, guardian, described, the, film, as, a, bold, and, successful, achievement, but, it, was, not, a, box, office, success, which, accounted, for, olivier, s, subsequent, failure, to, raise, the, funds, for, a, planned, film, of, macbeth, he, won, a, bafta, award, for, the, role, and, was, nominated, for, the, best, actor, academy, award, which, yul, brynner, won, in, 1955, olivier, and, leigh, were, invited, to, play, leading, roles, in, three, plays, at, the, shakespeare, memorial, theatre, stratford, they, began, with, twelfth, night, directed, by, gielgud, with, olivier, as, malvolio, and, leigh, as, viola, rehearsals, were, difficult, with, olivier, determined, to, play, his, conception, of, the, role, despite, the, director, s, view, that, it, was, vulgar, gielgud, later, commented, somehow, the, production, did, not, work, olivier, was, set, on, playing, malvolio, in, his, own, particular, rather, extravagant, way, he, was, extremely, moving, at, the, end, but, he, played, the, earlier, scenes, like, a, jewish, hairdresser, with, a, lisp, and, an, extraordinary, accent, and, he, insisted, on, falling, backwards, off, a, bench, in, the, garden, scene, though, i, begged, him, not, to, do, it, but, then, malvolio, is, a, very, difficult, part, the, next, production, was, macbeth, reviewers, were, lukewarm, about, the, direction, by, glen, byam, shaw, and, the, designs, by, roger, furse, but, olivier, s, performance, in, the, title, role, attracted, superlatives, to, j, c, trewin, olivier, s, was, the, finest, macbeth, of, our, day, to, darlington, it, was, the, best, macbeth, of, our, time, leigh, s, lady, macbeth, received, mixed, but, generally, polite, notices, although, to, the, end, of, his, life, olivier, believed, it, to, have, been, the, best, lady, macbeth, he, ever, saw, in, their, third, production, of, the,

olivier, s, performance, as, titus, received, the, greatest, ovation, in, stratford, history, from, the, first, night, audience, and, the, critics, hailed, the, production, as, a, landmark, in, post,

film, version, of, the, sleeping, prince, retitled, the, prince, and, the, showgirl, although, the, filming, was, challenging, because, of, monroe, s, behaviour, the, film, was, appreciated, by, the, critics, during, the, production, of, the, prince, and, the, showgirl, olivier, monroe, and, her, husband, the, american, playwright, arthur, miller, went, to, see, the, english, stage, company, s, production, of, john, osborne, s, look, back, in, anger, at, the, royal, court, olivier, had, seen, the, play, earlier, in, the, run, and, disliked, it, but, miller, was, convinced, that, osborne, had, talent, and, olivier, reconsidered, he, was, ready, for, a, change, of, direction, in, 1981, he, wrote, i, had, reached, a, stage, in, my, life, that, i, was, getting, profoundly, sick, of, not, just, tired, sick, consequently, the, public, were, likely, enough, beginning, to, agree, with, me, my, rhythm, of, work, had, become, a, bit, deadly, a, classical, or, semi, classical, film, a, play, or, two, at, stratford, or, a, nine, month, run, in, the, west, end, etc, etc, i, was, going, mad, desperately, searching, for, something, suddenly, fresh, and, thrillingly, exciting, what, i, felt,

variety, comedian, archie, rice, having, read, the, first, act, all, that, was, completed, by, then, olivier, asked, to, be, cast, in, the, part, he, had, for, years, maintained, that, he, might, easily, have, been, a, third, rate, comedian, called, larry, oliver, and, would, sometimes, play, the, character, at, parties, behind, archie, s, brazen, fa, ade, there, is, a, deep, desolation, and, olivier, caught, both, aspects, switching, in, the, words, of, the, biographer, anthony, holden, from, a, gleefully, tacky, comic, routine, to, moments, of, the, most, wrenching, pathos, tony,

relationship, that, endured, for, the, rest, of, his, life, olivier, said, that, playing, archie, made, me, feel, like, a, modern, actor, again, in, finding, an, avant, garde, play, that, suited, him, he, was, as, osborne, remarked, far, ahead, of, gielgud, and, ralph, richardson, who, did, not, successfully, follow, his, lead, for, more, than, a, decade, their, first, substantial, successes, in, works, by, any, of, osborne, s, generation, were, alan, bennett, s, forty, years, on, gielgud, in, 1968, and, david, storey, s, home, richardson, and, gielgud, in, 1970, olivier, received, another,

emotional, vulnerability, in, 1960, he, made, his, second, appearance, for, the, royal, court, company, in, ionesco, s, absurdist, play, rhinoceros, the, production, was, chiefly, remarkable, for, the, star, s, quarrels, with, the, director, orson, welles, who, according, to, the, biographer, francis, beckett, suffered, the, appalling, treatment, that, olivier, had, inflicted, on, gielgud, at,

only, a, great, actor, is, capable, near, the, frontiers, of, self, parody, the, director, jonathan, miller, thought, it, a, condescending, view, of, an, afro, caribbean, person, the, burden, of, playing, this, demanding, part, at, the, same, time, as, managing, the, new, company, and, planning, for, the, move, to, the, new, theatre, took, its, toll, on, olivier, to, add, to, his, load, he, felt, obliged, to, take, over, as, solness, in, the, master, builder, when, the, ailing, redgrave, withdrew, from, the, role, in, november, 1964, for, the, first, time, olivier, began, to, suffer,

lives, in, 1966, his, one, play, as, director, was, juno, and, the, paycock, the, times, commented, that, the, production, restores, one, s, faith, in, the, work, as, a, masterpiece, in, the, same, year, olivier, portrayed, the, mahdi, opposite, heston, as, general, gordon, in, the, film, khartoum, in, 1967, olivier, was, caught, in, the, middle, of, a, confrontation, between, chandos, and, tynan, over, the, latter, s, proposal, to, stage, rolf, hochhuth, s, soldiers, as, the, play, speculatively, depicted, churchill, as, complicit, in, the, assassination, of, the, polish, prime,

with, the, management, s, artistic, freedom, but, olivier, himself, stayed, firmly, in, place, and, tynan, also, remained, at, about, this, time, olivier, began, a, long, struggle, against, a,

recovered, enough, to, take, the, heavy, role, of, edgar, in, strindberg, s, the, dance, of, death, the, finest, of, all, his, performances, other, than, in, shakespeare, in, gielgud, s, view, olivier, had, intended, to, step, down, from, the, directorship, of, the, national, theatre, at, the, end, of, his, first, five, year, contract, having, he, hoped, led, the, company, into, its, new, building, by, 1968, because, of, bureaucratic, delays, construction, work, had, not, even, begun, and, he, agreed, to, serve, for, a, second, five, year, term, his, next, major, role, and, his, last, appearance, in, a, shakespeare, play, was, as, shylock, in, the, merchant, of, venice, his, first, appearance, in, the, work, he, had, intended, guinness, or, scofield, to, play, shylock, but, stepped, in, when, neither, was, available, the, production, by, jonathan, miller, and, olivier, s, performance, attracted, a, wide, range, of, responses, two, different, critics, reviewed, it, for, the, guardian, one, wrote, this, is, not, a, role, which, stretches, him, or, for, which, he, will, be, particularly, remembered, the, other, commented, that, the, performance, ranks, as, one, of, his, greatest, achievements, involving, his, whole, range, in, 1969, olivier, appeared, in, two, war, films, portraying, military, leaders, he, played, field, marshal, french, in, the, first, world,

actor, to, be, created, a, peer, for, services, to, the, theatre, although, he, initially, declined, the, honour, harold, wilson, the, incumbent, prime, minister, wrote, to, him, then, invited, him, and, plowright, to, dinner, and, persuaded, him, to, accept, after, this, olivier, played, three, more, stage, roles, james, tyrone, in, eugene, o, neill, s, long, day, s, journey, into, night, 1971, 72, antonio, in, eduardo, de, filippo, s, saturday, sunday, monday, and, john, tagg, in, trevor, griffiths, s, the, party, both, 1973, 74, among, the, roles, he, hoped, to, play, but, could, not,

for, the, academy, award, for, best, actor, losing, to, marlon, brando, in, the, godfather, the, last, two, stage, plays, olivier, directed, were, jean, giradoux, s, amphitryon, 1971, and, priestley,

by, the, board, and, olivier, felt, that, he, had, been, eased, out, although, he, had, declared, his, intention, to, go, and, that, he, had, not, been, properly, consulted, about, the, choice, of, successor, the, largest, of, the, three, theatres, within, the, national, s, new, building, was, named, in, his, honour, but, his, only, appearance, on, the, stage, of, the, olivier, theatre, was, at, its, official, opening, by, the, queen, in, october, 1976, when, he, made, a, speech, of, welcome, which, hall, privately, described, as, the, most, successful, part, of, the, evening, olivier, spent, the, last, 15, years, of, his, life, securing, his, finances, and, dealing, with, deteriorating, health, which, included, thrombosis, and, dermatomyositis, a, degenerative, muscle, disorder,

britain, he, also, took, a, number, of, cameo, film, roles, which, were, in, often, undistinguished, films, according, to, billington, olivier, s, move, from, leading, parts, to, supporting, and, cameo, roles, came, about, because, his, poor, health, meant, he, could, not, get, the, necessary, long, insurance, for, larger, parts, with, only, short, engagements, in, films, available, olivier, s, dermatomyositis, meant, he, spent, the, last, three, months, of, 1974, in, hospital, and, he, spent, early, 1975, slowly, recovering, and, regaining, his, strength, when, strong, enough, he, was, contacted, by, the, director, john, schlesinger, who, offered, him, the, role, of, a, nazi, torturer, in, the, 1976, film, marathon, man, olivier, shaved, his, pate, and, wore, oversized, glasses, to, enlarge, the, look, of, his, eyes, in, a, role, that, the, critic, david, robinson, writing, for, the, times, thought, was, strongly, played, adding, that, olivier, was, always, at, his, best, in,

for, granada, television, earning, his, fifth, emmy, he, thought, the, role, of, lear, much, less, demanding, than, other, tragic, shakespearean, heroes, no, lear, is, easy, he, s, like, all, of, us, really, he, s, just, a, stupid, old, fart, when, the, production, was, first, shown, on, american, television, the, critic, steve, vineberg, wrote, olivier, seems, to, have, thrown, away, technique, this, time, his, is, a, breathtakingly, pure, lear, in, his, final, speech, over, cordelia, s, lifeless, body, he, brings, us, so, close, to, lear, s, sorrow, that, we, can, hardly, bear, to, watch, because, we, have, seen, the, last, shakespearean, hero, laurence, olivier, will, ever, play, but, what, a, finale, in, this, most, sublime, of, plays, our, greatest, actor, has, given, an, indelible, performance, perhaps, it, would, be, most, appropriate, to, express, simple, gratitude, the, same, year, he, also, appeared, in, a, cameo, alongside, gielgud, and, richardson, in, wagner, with,

and, he, was, known, for, changing, his, appearance, considerably, from, role, to, role, by, his, own, admission, he, was, addicted, to, extravagant, make, up, and, unlike, richardson, and, gielgud, he, excelled, at, different, voices, and, accents, his, own, description, of, his, technique, was, working, from, the, outside, in, he, said, i, can, never, act, as, myself, i, have, to, have, a, pillow, up, my, jumper, a, false, nose, or, a, moustache, or, wig, i, cannot, come, on, looking, like, me, and, be, someone, else, rattigan, described, how, at, rehearsals, olivier, built, his, performance, slowly, and, with, immense, application, from, a, mass, of, tiny, details, this, attention, to, detail, had, its, critics, agate, remarked, when, i, look, at, a, watch, it, is, to, see, the, time, and, not, to, admire, the, mechanism, i, want, an, actor, to, tell, me, lear, s, time, of, day, and, olivier, doesn, t, he, bids, me, watch, the, wheels, go, round, tynan, remarked, to, olivier, you, aren, t, really, a, contemplative, or, philosophical, actor, olivier, was, known, for, the, strenuous, physicality, of, his, performances, in, some, roles, he, told, tynan, this, was, because, he, was, influenced, as, a, young, man, by, douglas, fairbanks, ramon, navarro, and, john, barrymore, in, films, and, barrymore, on, stage, as, hamlet, tremendously, athletic, i, admired, that, greatly, all, of, us, did, one, thought, of, oneself, idiotically, skinny, as, i, was, as, a, sort, of, tarzan, according, to, morley, gielgud, was, widely, considered, the, best, actor, in, the, world, from, the, neck, up, and, olivier, from, the, neck, down, olivier, described, the, contrast, thus, i, ve, always, thought, that, we, were, the, reverses, of, the, same, coin, the, top, half, john, all, spirituality, all, beauty, all, abstract, things, and, myself, as, all, earth, blood, humanity, olivier, a, classically, trained, actor, was, known, to, have, been, distrustful, of, method, acting, in, his, memoir, on, acting, he, exhorts, actors, to, have, stanislavski, with, you, in, your, study, or, in, your, limousine, but, don, t, bring, him, onto, the, film, set, during, production, of, the, prince, and, the, showgirl, he, quarrelled, with, marilyn, monroe, who, was, trained, under, lee, strasberg, s, method, over, her, acting, process, similarly, an, anecdote, casts, him, as, offering, dustin, hoffman, enduring, physical, travails, while, playing, in, marathon, man, a, curt, suggestion, why, don, t, you, just, try, acting, hoffman, disputes, the, details, of, this, account, which, he, claims, was, distorted, by, a, journalist, he, had, been, up, all, night, at, the, studio, 54, nightclub, for, personal, rather, than, professional, reasons, and, olivier, who, understood, this, was, joking, together, with, richardson, and, gielgud, olivier, was, internationally, recognised, as, one, of, the, great, trinity, of, theatrical, knights, who, dominated, the, british, stage, during, the, middle, and, later, decades, of, the, 20th, century, in, an, obituary, tribute, in, the, times, bernard, levin, wrote, what, we, have, lost, with, laurence, olivier, is, glory, he, reflected, it, in, his, greatest, roles, indeed, he, walked, clad, in, it, you, could, practically, see, it, glowing, around, him, like, a, nimbus, no, one, will, ever, play, the, roles, he, played, as, he, played, them, no, one, will, replace, the, splendour, that, he, gave, his, native, land, with, his, genius, billington, commented, elevated, the, art, of, acting, in, the, twentieth, century, principally, by, the, overwhelming, force, of, his, example, like, garrick, kean, and, irving, before, him, he, lent, glamour, and, excitement, to, acting, so, that, in, any, theatre, in, the, world, an, olivier, night, raised, the, level, of, expectation, and, sent, spectators, out, into, the, darkness, a, little, more, aware, of, themselves, and, having, experienced, a, transcendent, touch, of, ecstasy, that, in, the, end, was, the, true, measure, of, his, greatness, after, olivier, s, death, gielgud, reflected, he, followed, in, the, theatrical, tradition, of, kean, and, irving, he, respected, tradition, in, the, theatre, but, he, also, took, great, delight, in, breaking, tradition, which, is, what, made, him, so, unique, he, was, gifted, brilliant, and, one, of, the, great, controversial, figures, of, our, time, in, theatre, which, is, a, virtue, and, not, a, vice, at, all, olivier, said, in, 1963, that, he, believed, he, was, born, to, be, an, actor, but, his, colleague, peter, ustinov, disagreed, he, commented, that, although, olivier, s, great, contemporaries, were, clearly, predestined, for, the, stage, larry, could, have, been, a, notable, ambassador, a, considerable, minister, a, redoubtable, cleric, at, his, worst, he, would, have, acted, the, parts, more, ably, than, they, are, usually, lived, the, director, david, ayliff, agreed, that, acting, did, not, come, instinctively, to, olivier, as, it, did, to, his, great, rivals, he, observed, ralph, was, a, natural, actor, he, couldn, t, stop, being, a, perfect, actor, olivier, did, it, through, sheer, hard, work, and, determination, the, american, actor, william, redfield, had, a, similar, view, ironically, enough, laurence, olivier, is, less, gifted, than, marlon, brando, he, is, even, less, gifted, than, richard, burton, paul, scofield, ralph, richardson, and, john, gielgud, but, he, is, still, the, definitive, actor, of, the, twentieth, century, why, because, he, wanted, to, be, his, achievements, are, due, to, dedication, scholarship, practice, determination, and, courage, he, is, the, bravest, actor, of, our, time, in, comparing, olivier, and, the, other, leading, actors, of, his, generation, ustinov, wrote, it, is, of, course, vain, to, talk, of, who, is, and, who, is, not, the, greatest, actor, there, is, simply, no, such, thing, as, a, greatest, actor, or, painter, or, composer, nonetheless, some, colleagues, particularly, film, actors, such, as, spencer, tracy, humphrey, bogart, and, lauren, bacall, came, to, regard, olivier, as, the, finest, of, his, peers, peter, hall, though, acknowledging, olivier, as, the, head, of, the, theatrical, profession, thought, richardson, the, greater, actor, olivier, s, claim, to, theatrical, greatness, lay, not, only, in, his, acting, but, as, in, hall, s, words, the, supreme, man, of, the, theatre, of, our, time, pioneering, britain, s, national, theatre, as, bragg, identified, no, one, doubts, that, the, national, is, perhaps, his, most, enduring, monument
