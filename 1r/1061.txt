canonised, as, a, saint, she, is, traditionally, credited, for, the, conversion, of, her, son, constantine, served, with, distinction, under, the, roman, emperors, diocletian, and, galerius, he,

wars, against, emperors, maxentius, and, licinius, to, become, the, sole, ruler, of, the, roman, empire, by, 324, upon, his, ascension, constantine, enacted, numerous, reforms, to, strengthen, the, empire, he, restructured, the, government, separating, civil, and, military, authorities, to, combat, inflation, he, introduced, the, solidus, a, new, gold, coin, that, became, the, standard, for, byzantine, and, european, currencies, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, the, roman, army, was, reorganised, to, consist, of, mobile, units, comitatenses, often, around, the, emperor, to, serve, on, campaigns, against, external, enemies, or, roman, rebels, and, frontier, garrison, troops, limitanei, which, were, capable, of, countering, barbarian, raids, but, less, and, less, capable, over, time, of, countering, full, scale, barbarian, invasions, constantine, pursued, successful, campaigns, against, the, tribes, on, the, roman, frontiers, such, as, the, franks, the, alemanni, the, goths, and, the, sarmatians, and, resettled, territories, abandoned, by, his, predecessors, during, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, with, citizens, of, roman, culture, although, constantine, lived, much, of, his, life, as, a, pagan, and, later, as, a, catechumen, he, began, to, favour, christianity, beginning, in, 312, finally, becoming, a, christian, and, being, baptised, by, eusebius, of, nicomedia, an, arian, bishop, although, the, catholic, church, and, the, coptic, orthodox, church, maintain, that, he, was, baptised, by, pope, sylvester, i, he, played, an, influential, role, in, the,

deemed, the, holiest, place, in, all, of, christendom, the, papal, claim, to, temporal, power, in, the, high, middle, ages, was, based, on, the, fabricated, donation, of, constantine, he, has, historically, been, referred, to, as, the, first, christian, emperor, but, while, he, did, favour, the, christian, church, some, modern, scholars, debate, his, beliefs, and, even, his, comprehension, of, christianity, nevertheless, he, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, eastern, christianity, and, he, did, much, to, push, christianity, towards, the, mainstream, of, roman, culture, the, age, of, constantine, marked, a, distinct, epoch, in, the, history, of, the, roman, empire, and, a, pivotal, moment, in, the, transition, from, classical, antiquity, to, the, middle, ages, he, built, a, new, imperial, residence, in, the, city, of, byzantium, and, renamed, it, new, rome, later, adopting, the, name, constantinople, after, himself, where, it, was, located, in, modern, istanbul, it, subsequently, became, the, capital, of, the, empire, for, more, than, a, thousand, years, the, later, eastern, roman, empire, often, being, referred, to, in, english, as, the, byzantine, empire, a, term, never, used, by, the, empire, invented, by, german, historian, hieronymus, wolf, his, more, immediate, political, legacy, was, that, he, replaced, diocletian, s, tetrarchy, with, the, de, facto, principle, of, dynastic, succession, by, leaving, the, empire, to, his, sons, and, other, members, of, the, constantinian, dynasty, his, reputation, flourished, during, the, lifetime, of, his, children, and, for, centuries, after, his, reign, the, medieval, church, held, him, up, as, a, paragon, of, virtue, while, secular, rulers, invoked, him, as, a, prototype, a, point, of, reference, and, the, symbol, of, imperial, legitimacy, and, identity, at, the, beginning, of, the, renaissance, there, were, more, critical, appraisals, of, his, reign, with, the, rediscovery, of, anti, constantinian, sources, trends, in, modern, and, recent, scholarship, have, attempted, to, balance, the, extremes, of, previous, scholarship, constantine, was, a, ruler, of, major, importance, and, has, always, been, a, controversial, figure, the, fluctuations, in, his, reputation, reflect, the, nature, of, the, ancient, sources, for, his, reign, these, are, abundant, and, detailed, but, they, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, the, official, propaganda, of, the, period, and, are, often, one, sided, no, contemporaneous, histories, or, biographies, dealing, with, his, life, and, rule, have, survived, the, nearest, replacement, is, eusebius, s, vita, constantini, a, mixture, of, eulogy, and, hagiography, written, between, 335, and, circa, 339, that, extols, constantine, s, moral, and, religious, virtues, the, vita, creates, a, contentiously, positive, image, of, constantine, and, modern, historians, have, frequently, challenged, its, reliability, the, fullest, secular, life, of, constantine, is, the, anonymous, origo, constantini, a, work, of, uncertain, date, which, focuses, on, military, and, political, events, to, the, neglect, of, cultural, and, religious, matters, lactantius, de, mortibus, persecutorum, a, political, christian, pamphlet, on, the, reigns, of, diocletian, and, the, tetrarchy, provides, valuable, but, tendentious, detail, on, constantine, s, predecessors, and, early, life, the, ecclesiastical, histories, of, socrates, sozomen, and, theodoret, describe, the, ecclesiastic, disputes, of, constantine, s, later, reign, written, during, the, reign, of, theodosius, ii, r, 402, 450, a, century, after, constantine, s, reign, these, ecclesiastical, historians, obscure, the, events, and, theologies, of, the, constantinian, period, through, misdirection, misrepresentation, and, deliberate, obscurity, the, contemporary, writings, of, the, orthodox, christian, athanasius, and, the, ecclesiastical, history, of, the, arian, philostorgius, also, survive, though, their, biases, are, no, less, firm, the, epitomes, of, aurelius, victor, de, caesaribus, eutropius, breviarium, festus, breviarium, and, the, anonymous, author, of, the, epitome, de, caesaribus, offer, compressed, secular, political, and, military, histories, of, the, period, although, not, christian, the, epitomes, paint, a, favourable, image, of, constantine, but, omit, reference, to, constantine, s, religious, policies, the, panegyrici, latini, a, collection, of, panegyrics, from, the, late, 3rd, and, early, 4th, centuries, provides, valuable, information, on,

gamzigrad, and, c, rdoba, epigraphic, remains, and, the, coinage, of, the, era, complement, the, literary, sources, constantine, was, born, on, 27, february, c, ad, 272, in, the, city, of, naissus, a, time, where, the, unity, of, the, empire, was, threatened, by, the, breakaway, wars, of, the, palmyrene, empire, the, city, which, is, modern, day, ni, in, serbia, was, part, of, the, dardania, province, of, moesia, his, father, was, flavius, constantius, an, illyrian, who, was, born, in, the, same, region, then, called, dacia, ripensis, and, a, native, of, the, province, of, moesia, his, original, full, name, as, well, as, that, of, his, father, is, not, known, his, praenomen, is, variously, given, as, lucius, marcus, and, gaius, whatever, the, case, praenomina, had, already, disappeared, from, most, public, records, by, this, time, he, also, adopted, the, name, valerius, the, nomen, of, emperor, diocletian, following, his, father, s, ascension, as, caesar, constantine, probably, spent, little, time, with, his, father, who, was, an, officer, in, the, roman, army, part, of, emperor, aurelian, s, imperial, bodyguard, being, described, as, a, tolerant, and, politically, skilled, man, constantius, advanced, through, the, ranks, earning, the, governorship, of, dalmatia, from, emperor, diocletian, another, of, aurelian, s, companions, from, illyricum, in, 284, or, 285, constantine, s, mother, was, helena, a, greek, woman, of, low, social, standing, from, helenopolis, of, bithynia, it, is, uncertain, whether, she, was, legally, married, to, constantius, or, merely, his, concubine, his, main, language, was, latin, and, during, his, public, speeches, he, needed, greek, translators, in, april, 286, diocletian, declared, maximian, another, colleague, from, illyricum, his, co, emperor, each, emperor, would, have, his, own, court, his, own, military, and, administrative, faculties, and, each, would, rule, with, a, separate, praetorian, prefect, as, chief, lieutenant, maximian, ruled, in, the, west, from, his, capitals, at, mediolanum, milan, italy, or, augusta, treverorum, trier, germany, while, diocletian, ruled, in, the, east, from, nicomedia, zmit, turkey, the, division, was, merely, pragmatic, the, empire, was, called, indivisible, in, official, panegyric, and, both, emperors, could, move, freely, throughout, the, empire, in, 288, maximian, appointed, constantius, to, serve, as, his, praetorian, prefect, in, gaul, constantius, left, helena, to, marry, maximian, s, stepdaughter, theodora, in, 288, or, 289, diocletian, divided, the, empire, again, in, 293, appointing, two, caesars, to, rule, over, further, subdivisions, of, east, and, west, each, would, be, subordinate, to, his, respective, augustus, but, would, act, with, supreme, authority, in, his, assigned, lands, this, system, would, later, be, called, the, tetrarchy, diocletian, s, first, appointee, for, the, office, of, caesar, was, constantius, his, second, was, galerius, a, native, of, felix, romuliana, according, to, lactantius, galerius, was, a, brutal, animalistic, man, although, he, shared, the, paganism, of, rome, s, aristocracy, he, seemed, to, them, an, alien, figure, a, semi, barbarian, on, 1, march, constantius, was, promoted, to, the, office, of, caesar, and, dispatched, to, gaul, to, fight, the, rebels, carausius, and, allectus, in, spite, of, meritocratic, overtones, the, tetrarchy, retained, vestiges, of, hereditary, privilege, and, constantine, became, the, prime, candidate, for, future, appointment, as, caesar, as, soon, as, his, father, took, the, position, constantine, went, to, the, court, of, diocletian, where, he, lived, as, his, father, s, heir, presumptive, constantine, received, a, formal, education, at, diocletian, s, court, where, he, learned, latin, literature, greek, and, philosophy, the, cultural, environment, in, nicomedia, was, open, fluid, and, socially, mobile, in, it, constantine, could, mix, with, intellectuals, both, pagan, and, christian, he, may, have, attended, the, lectures, of, lactantius, a, christian, scholar, of, latin, in, the, city, because, diocletian, did, not, completely, trust, constantius, none, of, the, tetrarchs, fully, trusted, their, colleagues, constantine, was, held, as, something, of, a, hostage, a, tool, to, ensure, constantius, best, behavior, constantine, was, nonetheless, a, prominent, member, of, the, court, he, fought, for, diocletian, and, galerius, in, asia, and, served, in, a, variety, of, tribunates, he, campaigned, against, barbarians, on, the, danube, in, 296, and, fought, the, persians, under, diocletian, in, syria, in, 297, as, well, as, under, galerius, in, mesopotamia, in, 298, 299, by, late, 305, he, had, become, a, tribune, of, the, first, order, a, tribunus, ordinis, primi, constantine, had, returned, to, nicomedia, from, the, eastern, front, by, the, spring, of, 303, in, time, to, witness, the, beginnings, of, diocletian, s, great, persecution, the, most, severe, persecution, of, christians, in, roman, history, in, late, 302, diocletian, and, galerius, sent, a, messenger, to, the, oracle, of, apollo, at, didyma, with, an, inquiry, about, christians, constantine, could, recall, his, presence, at, the, palace, when, the, messenger, returned, and, diocletian, accepted, the, imperial, court, s, demands, for, universal, persecution, on, 23, february, 303, diocletian, ordered, the, destruction, of, nicomedia, s, new, church, condemned, its, scriptures, to, the, flames, and, had, its, treasures, seized, in, the, months, that, followed, churches, and, scriptures, were, destroyed, christians, were, deprived, of, official, ranks, and, priests, were, imprisoned, it, is, unlikely, that, constantine, played, any, role, in, the, persecution, in, his, later, writings, he, attempted, to, present, himself, as, an, opponent, of, diocletian, s, sanguinary, edicts, against, the, worshippers, of, god, but, nothing, indicates, that, he, opposed, it, effectively, at, the, time, although, no, contemporary, christian, challenged, constantine, for, his, inaction, during, the, persecutions, it, remained, a, political, liability, throughout, his, life, on, 1, may, 305, diocletian, as, a, result, of, a, debilitating, sickness, taken, in, the, winter, of, 304, 305, announced, his, resignation, in, a, parallel, ceremony, in, milan, maximian, did, the, same, lactantius, states, that, galerius, manipulated, the, weakened, diocletian, into, resigning, and, forced, him, to, accept, galerius, allies, in, the, imperial, succession, according, to, lactantius, the, crowd, listening, to, diocletian, s, resignation, speech, believed, until, the, last, moment, that, diocletian, would, choose, constantine, and, maxentius, maximian, s, son, as, his, successors, it, was, not, to, be, constantius, and, galerius, were, promoted, to, augusti, while, severus, and, maximinus, galerius, nephew, were, appointed, their, caesars, respectively, constantine, and, maxentius, were, ignored, some, of, the, ancient, sources, detail, plots, that, galerius, made, on, constantine, s, life, in, the, months, following, diocletian, s, abdication, they, assert, that, galerius, assigned, constantine, to, lead, an, advance, unit, in, a, cavalry, charge, through, a, swamp, on, the, middle, danube, made, him, enter, into, single, combat, with, a, lion, and, attempted, to, kill, him, in, hunts, and, wars, constantine, always, emerged, victorious, the, lion, emerged, from, the, contest, in, a, poorer, condition, than, constantine, constantine, returned, to, nicomedia, from, the, danube, with, a, sarmatian, captive, to, drop, at, galerius, feet, it, is, uncertain, how, much, these, tales, can, be, trusted, constantine, recognised, the, implicit, danger, in, remaining, at, galerius, court, where, he, was, held, as, a, virtual, hostage, his, career, depended, on, being, rescued, by, his, father, in, the, west, constantius, was, quick, to, intervene, in, the, late, spring, or, early, summer, of, 305, constantius, requested, leave, for, his, son, to, help, him, campaign, in, britain, after, a, long, evening, of, drinking, galerius, granted, the, request, constantine, s, later, propaganda, describes, how, he, fled, the, court, in, the, night, before, galerius, could, change, his, mind, he, rode, from, post, house, to, post, house, at, high, speed, hamstringing, every, horse, in, his, wake, by, the, time, galerius, awoke, the, following, morning, constantine, had, fled, too, far, to, be, caught, constantine, joined, his, father, in, gaul, at, bononia, boulogne, before, the, summer, of, 305, from, bononia, they, crossed, the, english, channel, to, britain, and, made, their, way, to, eboracum, york, capital, of, the, province, of, britannia, secunda, and, home, to, a, large, military, base, constantine, was, able, to, spend, a, year, in, northern, britain, at, his, father, s, side, campaigning, against, the, picts, beyond, hadrian, s, wall, in, the, summer, and, autumn, constantius, campaign, like, that, of, septimius, severus, before, it, probably, advanced, far, into, the, north, without, achieving, great, success, constantius, had, become, severely, sick, over, the, course, of, his, reign, and, died, on, 25, july, 306, in, eboracum, before, dying, he, declared, his, support, for, raising, constantine, to, the, rank, of, full, augustus, the, alamannic, king, chrocus, a, barbarian, taken, into, service, under, constantius, then, proclaimed, constantine, as, augustus, the, troops, loyal, to, constantius, memory, followed, him, in, acclamation, gaul, and, britain, quickly, accepted, his, rule, hispania, which, had, been, in, his, father, s, domain, for, less, than, a, year, rejected, it, constantine, sent, galerius, an, official, notice, of, constantius, death, and, his, own, acclamation, along, with, the, notice, he, included, a, portrait, of, himself, in, the, robes, of, an, augustus, the, portrait, was, wreathed, in, bay, he, requested, recognition, as, heir, to, his, father, s, throne, and, passed, off, responsibility, for, his, unlawful, ascension, on, his, army, claiming, they, had, forced, it, upon, him, galerius, was, put, into, a, fury, by, the, message, he, almost, set, the, portrait, and, messenger, on, fire, his, advisers, calmed, him, and, argued, that, outright, denial, of, constantine, s, claims, would, mean, certain, war, galerius, was, compelled, to, compromise, he, granted, constantine, the, title, caesar, rather, than, augustus, the, latter, office, went, to, severus, instead, wishing, to, make, it, clear, that, he, alone, gave, constantine, legitimacy, galerius, personally, sent, constantine, the, emperor, s, traditional, purple, robes, constantine, accepted, the, decision, knowing, that, it, would, remove, doubts, as, to, his, legitimacy, constantine, s, share, of, the, empire, consisted, of, britain, gaul, and, spain, and, he, commanded, one, of, the, largest, roman, armies, which, was, stationed, along, the, important, rhine, frontier, he, remained, in, britain, after, his, promotion, to, emperor, driving, back, the, tribes, of, the, picts, and, securing, his, control, in, the, northwestern, dioceses, he, completed, the, reconstruction, of, military, bases, begun, under, his, father, s, rule, and, he, ordered, the, repair, of, the, region, s, roadways, he, then, left, for, augusta, treverorum, trier, in, gaul, the, tetrarchic, capital, of, the, northwestern, roman, empire, the, franks, learned, of, constantine, s, acclamation, and, invaded, gaul, across, the, lower, rhine, over, the, winter, of, 306, 307, he, drove, them, back, beyond, the, rhine, and, captured, kings, ascaric, and, merogais, the, kings, and, their, soldiers, were, fed, to, the, beasts, of, trier, s, amphitheatre, in, the, adventus, arrival, celebrations, which, followed, constantine, began, a, major, expansion, of, trier, he, strengthened, the, circuit, wall, around, the, city, with, military, towers, and, fortified, gates, and, he, began, building, a, palace, complex, in, the, northeastern, part, of, the, city, to, the, south, of, his, palace, he, ordered, the, construction, of, a, large, formal, audience, hall, and, a, massive, imperial, bathhouse, he, sponsored, many, building, projects, throughout, gaul, during, his, tenure, as, emperor, of, the, west, especially, in, augustodunum, autun, and, arelate, arles, according, to, lactantius, constantine, followed, a, tolerant, policy, towards, christianity, although, he, was, not, yet, a, christian, he, probably, judged, it, a, more, sensible, policy, than, open, persecution, and, a, way, to, distinguish, himself, from, the, great, persecutor, galerius, he, decreed, a, formal, end, to, persecution, and, returned, to, christians, all, that, they, had, lost, during, them, constantine, was, largely, untried, and, had, a, hint, of, illegitimacy, about, him, he, relied, on, his, father, s, reputation, in, his, early, propaganda, which, gave, as, much, coverage, to, his, father, s, deeds, as, to, his, his, military, skill, and, building, projects, however, soon, gave, the, panegyrist, the, opportunity, to, comment, favourably, on, the, similarities, between, father, and, son, and, eusebius, remarked, that, constantine, was, a, renewal, as, it, were, in, his, own, person, of, his, father, s, life, and, reign, constantinian, coinage, sculpture, and, oratory, also, show, a, tendency, for, disdain, towards, the, barbarians, beyond, the, frontiers, he, minted, a, coin, issue, after, his, victory, over, the, alemanni, which, depicts, weeping, and, begging, alemannic, tribesmen, the, alemanni, conquered, beneath, the, phrase, romans, rejoicing, there, was, little, sympathy, for, these, enemies, as, his, panegyrist, declared, it, is, a, stupid, clemency, that, spares, the, conquered, foe, following, galerius, recognition, of, constantine, as, caesar, constantine, s, portrait, was, brought, to, rome, as, was, customary, maxentius, mocked, the, portrait, s, subject, as, the, son, of, a, harlot, and, lamented, his, own, powerlessness, maxentius, envious, of, constantine, s, authority, seized, the, title, of, emperor, on, 28, october, 306, galerius, refused, to, recognize, him, but, failed, to, unseat, him, severus, was, sent, against, maxentius, in, april, 307, but, during, the, campaign, severus, armies, previously, under, command, of, maxentius, father, maximian, defected, and, severus, was, seized, and, imprisoned, maximian, brought, out, of, retirement, by, his, son, s, rebellion, left, for, gaul, to, confer, with, constantine, he, offered, to, marry, his, daughter, fausta, to, constantine, and, elevate, him, to, augustan, rank, in, return, constantine, would, reaffirm, the, old, family, alliance, between, maximian, and, constantius, and, offer, support, to, maxentius, cause, in, italy, constantine, accepted, and, married, fausta, in, trier, in, summer, 307, constantine, gave, maxentius, his, meagre, support, offering, maxentius, political, recognition, constantine, remained, aloof, from, the, italian, conflict, however, over, the, spring, and, summer, of, 307, he, had, left, gaul, for, britain, to, avoid, any, involvement, in, the, italian, turmoil, now, instead, of, giving, maxentius, military, aid, he, sent, his, troops, against, germanic, tribes, along, the, rhine, in, 308, he, raided, the, territory, of, the, bructeri, and, made, a, bridge, across, the, rhine, at, colonia, agrippinensium, cologne, in, 310, he, marched, to, the, northern, rhine, and, fought, the, franks, when, not, campaigning, he, toured, his, lands, advertising, his, benevolence, and, supporting, the, economy, and, the, arts, his, refusal, to, participate, in, the, war, increased, his, popularity, among, his, people, and, strengthened, his, power, base, in, the, west, maximian, returned, to, rome, in, the, winter, of, 307, 308, but, soon, fell, out, with, his, son, in, early, 308, after, a, failed, attempt, to, usurp, maxentius, title, maximian, returned, to, constantine, s, court, on, 11, november, 308, galerius, called, a, general, council, at, the, military, city, of, carnuntum, petronell, carnuntum, austria, to, resolve, the, instability, in, the, western, provinces, in, attendance, were, diocletian, briefly, returned, from, retirement, galerius, and, maximian, maximian, was, forced, to, abdicate, again, and, constantine, was, again, demoted, to, caesar, licinius, one, of, galerius, old, military, companions, was, appointed, augustus, in, the, western, regions, the, new, system, did, not, last, long, constantine, refused, to, accept, the, demotion, and, continued, to, style, himself, as, augustus, on, his, coinage, even, as, other, members, of, the, tetrarchy, referred, to, him, as, a, caesar, on, theirs, maximinus, was, frustrated, that, he, had, been, passed, over, for, promotion, while, the, newcomer, licinius, had, been, raised, to, the, office, of, augustus, and, demanded, that, galerius, promote, him, galerius, offered, to, call, both, maximinus, and, constantine, sons, of, the, augusti, but, neither, accepted, the, new, title, by, the, spring, of, 310, galerius, was, referring, to, both, men, as, augusti, in, 310, a, dispossessed, maximian, rebelled, against, constantine, while, constantine, was, away, campaigning, against, the, franks, maximian, had, been, sent, south, to, arles, with, a, contingent, of, constantine, s, army, in, preparation, for, any, attacks, by, maxentius, in, southern, gaul, he, announced, that, constantine, was, dead, and, took, up, the, imperial, purple, in, spite, of, a, large, donative, pledge, to, any, who, would, support, him, as, emperor, most, of, constantine, s, army, remained, loyal, to, their, emperor, and, maximian, was, soon, compelled, to, leave, when, constantine, heard, of, the, rebellion, he, abandoned, his, campaign, against, the, franks, and, marched, his, army, up, the, rhine, at, cabillunum, chalon, sur, sa, ne, he, moved, his, troops, onto, waiting, boats, to, row, down, the, slow, waters, of, the, sa, ne, to, the, quicker, waters, of, the, rhone, he, disembarked, at, lugdunum, lyon, maximian, fled, to, massilia, marseille, a, town, better, able, to, withstand, a, long, siege, than, arles, it, made, little, difference, however, as, loyal, citizens, opened, the, rear, gates, to, constantine, maximian, was, captured, and, reproved, for, his, crimes, constantine, granted, some, clemency, but, strongly, encouraged, his, suicide, in, july, 310, maximian, hanged, himself, in, spite, of, the, earlier, rupture, in, their, relations, maxentius, was, eager, to, present, himself, as, his, father, s, devoted, son, after, his, death, he, began, minting, coins, with, his, father, s, deified, image, proclaiming, his, desire, to, avenge, maximian, s, death, constantine, initially, presented, the, suicide, as, an, unfortunate, family, tragedy, by, 311, however, he, was, spreading, another, version, according, to, this, after, constantine, had, pardoned, him, maximian, planned, to, murder, constantine, in, his, sleep, fausta, learned, of, the, plot, and, warned, constantine, who, put, a, eunuch, in, his, own, place, in, bed, maximian, was, apprehended, when, he, killed, the, eunuch, and, was, offered, suicide, which, he, accepted, along, with, using, propaganda, constantine, instituted, a, damnatio, memoriae, on, maximian, destroying, all, inscriptions, referring, to, him, and, eliminating, any, public, work, bearing, his, image, the, death, of, maximian, required, a, shift, in, constantine, s, public, image, he, could, no, longer, rely, on, his, connection, to, the, elder, emperor, maximian, and, needed, a, new, source, of, legitimacy, in, a, speech, delivered, in, gaul, on, 25, july, 310, the, anonymous, orator, reveals, a, previously, unknown, dynastic, connection, to, claudius, ii, a, 3rd, century, emperor, famed, for, defeating, the, goths, and, restoring, order, to, the, empire, breaking, away, from, tetrarchic, models, the, speech, emphasizes, constantine, s, ancestral, prerogative, to, rule, rather, than, principles, of, imperial, equality, the, new, ideology, expressed, in, the, speech, made, galerius, and, maximian, irrelevant, to, constantine, s, right, to, rule, indeed, the, orator, emphasizes, ancestry, to, the, exclusion, of, all, other, factors, no, chance, agreement, of, men, nor, some, unexpected, consequence, of, favour, made, you, emperor, the, orator, declares, to, constantine, the, oration, also, moves, away, from, the, religious, ideology, of, the, tetrarchy, with, its, focus, on, twin, dynasties, of, jupiter, and, hercules, instead, the, orator, proclaims, that, constantine, experienced, a, divine, vision, of, apollo, and, victory, granting, him, laurel, wreaths, of, health, and, a, long, reign, in, the, likeness, of, apollo, constantine, recognised, himself, as, the, saving, figure, to, whom, would, be, granted, rule, of, the, whole, world, as, the, poet, virgil, had, once, foretold, the, oration, s, religious, shift, is, paralleled, by, a, similar, shift, in, constantine, s, coinage, in, his, early, reign, the, coinage, of, constantine, advertised, mars, as, his, patron, from, 310, on, mars, was, replaced, by, sol, invictus, a, god, conventionally, identified, with, apollo, there, is, little, reason, to, believe, that, either, the, dynastic, connection, or, the, divine, vision, are, anything, other, than, fiction, but, their, proclamation, strengthened, constantine, s, claims, to, legitimacy, and, increased, his, popularity, among, the, citizens, of, gaul, by, the, middle, of, 310, galerius, had, become, too, ill, to, involve, himself, in, imperial, politics, his, final, act, survives, a, letter, to, provincials, posted, in, nicomedia, on, 30, april, 311, proclaiming, an, end, to, the, persecutions, and, the, resumption, of, religious, toleration, eusebius, maintains, divine, providence, took, action, against, the, perpetrator, of, these, crimes, and, gives, a, graphic, account, of, galerius, demise, without, warning, suppurative, inflammation, broke, out, round, the, middle, of, his, genitals, then, a, deep, seated, fistula, ulcer, these, ate, their, way, incurably, into, his, innermost, bowels, from, them, came, a, teeming, indescribable, mass, of, worms, and, a, sickening, smell, was, given, off, for, the, whole, of, his, hulking, body, thanks, to, over, eating, had, been, transformed, even, before, his, illness, into, a, huge, lump, of, flabby, fat, which, then, decomposed, and, presented, those, who, came, near, it, with, a, revolting, and, horrifying, sight, galerius, died, soon, after, the, edict, s, proclamation, destroying, what, little, remained, of, the, tetrarchy, maximinus, mobilised, against, licinius, and, seized, asia, minor, a, hasty, peace, was, signed, on, a, boat, in, the, middle, of, the, bosphorus, while, constantine, toured, britain, and, gaul, maxentius, prepared, for, war, he, fortified, northern, italy, and, strengthened, his, support, in, the, christian, community, by, allowing, it, to, elect, eusebius, as, bishop, of, rome, maxentius, rule, was, nevertheless, insecure, his, early, support, dissolved, in, the, wake, of, heightened, tax, rates, and, depressed, trade, riots, broke, out, in, rome, and, carthage, and, domitius, alexander, was, able, to, briefly, usurp, his, authority, in, africa, by, 312, he, was, a, man, barely, tolerated, not, one, actively, supported, even, among, christian, italians, in, the, summer, of, 311, maxentius, mobilised, against, constantine, while, licinius, was, occupied, with, affairs, in, the, east, he, declared, war, on, constantine, vowing, to, avenge, his, father, s, murder, to, prevent, maxentius, from, forming, an, alliance, against, him, with, licinius, constantine, forged, his, own, alliance, with, licinius, over, the, winter, of, 311, 312, and, offered, him, his, sister, constantia, in, marriage, maximinus, considered, constantine, s, arrangement, with, licinius, an, affront, to, his, authority, in, response, he, sent, ambassadors, to, rome, offering, political, recognition, to, maxentius, in, exchange, for, a, military, support, which, maxentius, accepted, according, to, eusebius, inter, regional, travel, became, impossible, and, there, was, military, buildup, everywhere, there, was, not, a, place, where, people, were, not, expecting, the, onset, of, hostilities, every, day, constantine, s, advisers, and, generals, cautioned, against, preemptive, attack, on, maxentius, even, his, soothsayers, recommended, against, it, stating, that, the, sacrifices, had, produced, unfavourable, omens, constantine, with, a, spirit, that, left, a, deep, impression, on, his, followers, inspiring, some, to, believe, that, he, had, some, form, of, supernatural, guidance, ignored, all, these, cautions, early, in, the, spring, of, 312, constantine, crossed, the, cottian, alps, with, a, quarter, of, his, army, a, force, numbering, about, 40, 000, the, first, town, his, army, encountered, was, segusium, susa, italy, a, heavily, fortified, town, that, shut, its, gates, to, him, constantine, ordered, his, men, to, set, fire, to, its, gates, and, scale, its, walls, he, took, the, town, quickly, constantine, ordered, his, troops, not, to, loot, the, town, and, advanced, into, northern, italy, at, the, approach, to, the, west, of, the, important, city, of, augusta, taurinorum, turin, italy, constantine, met, a, large, force, of, heavily, armed, maxentian, cavalry, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, turin, constantine, s, army, encircled, maxentius, cavalry, flanked, them, with, his, own, cavalry, and, dismounted, them, with, blows, from, his, soldiers, iron, tipped, clubs, constantine, s, armies, emerged, victorious, turin, refused, to, give, refuge, to, maxentius, retreating, forces, opening, its, gates, to, constantine, instead, other, cities, of, the, north, italian, plain, sent, constantine, embassies, of, congratulation, for, his, victory, he, moved, on, to, milan, where, he, was, met, with, open, gates, and, jubilant, rejoicing, constantine, rested, his, army, in, milan, until, mid, summer, 312, when, he, moved, on, to, brixia, brescia, brescia, s, army, was, easily, dispersed, and, constantine, quickly, advanced, to, verona, where, a, large, maxentian, force, was, camped, ruricius, pompeianus, general, of, the, veronese, forces, and, maxentius, praetorian, prefect, was, in, a, strong, defensive, position, since, the, town, was, surrounded, on, three, sides, by, the, adige, constantine, sent, a, small, force, north, of, the, town, in, an, attempt, to, cross, the, river, unnoticed, ruricius, sent, a, large, detachment, to, counter, constantine, s, expeditionary, force, but, was, defeated, constantine, s, forces, successfully, surrounded, the, town, and, laid, siege, ruricius, gave, constantine, the, slip, and, returned, with, a, larger, force, to, oppose, constantine, constantine, refused, to, let, up, on, the, siege, and, sent, only, a, small, force, to, oppose, him, in, the, desperately, fought, encounter, that, followed, ruricius, was, killed, and, his, army, destroyed, verona, surrendered, soon, afterwards, followed, by, aquileia, mutina, modena, and, ravenna, the, road, to, rome, was, now, wide, open, to, constantine, maxentius, prepared, for, the, same, type, of, war, he, had, waged, against, severus, and, galerius, he, sat, in, rome, and, prepared, for, a, siege, he, still, controlled, rome, s, praetorian, guard, was, well, stocked, with, african, grain, and, was, surrounded, on, all, sides, by, the, seemingly, impregnable, aurelian, walls, he, ordered, all, bridges, across, the, tiber, cut, reportedly, on, the, counsel, of, the, gods, and, left, the, rest, of, central, italy, undefended, constantine, secured, that, region, s, support, without, challenge, constantine, progressed, slowly, along, the, via, flaminia, allowing, the, weakness, of, maxentius, to, draw, his, regime, further, into, turmoil, maxentius, support, continued, to, weaken, at, chariot, races, on, 27, october, the, crowd, openly, taunted, maxentius, shouting, that, constantine, was, invincible, maxentius, no, longer, certain, that, he, would, emerge, from, a, siege, victorious, built, a, temporary, boat, bridge, across, the, tiber, in, preparation, for, a, field, battle, against, constantine, on, 28, october, 312, the, sixth, anniversary, of, his, reign, he, approached, the, keepers, of, the, sibylline, books, for, guidance, the, keepers, prophesied, that, on, that, very, day, the, enemy, of, the, romans, would, die, maxentius, advanced, north, to, meet, constantine, in, battle, maxentius, forces, were, still, twice, the, size, of, constantine, s, and, he, organised, them, in, long, lines, facing, the, battle, plain, with, their, backs, to, the, river, constantine, s, army, arrived, on, the, field, bearing, unfamiliar, symbols, on, their, standards, and, their, shields, according, to, lactantius, constantine, was, directed, in, a, dream, to, cause, the, heavenly, sign, to, be, delineated, on, the, shields, of, his, soldiers, and, so, to, proceed, to, battle, he, did, as, he, had, been, commanded, and, he, marked, on, their, shields, the, letter, with, a, perpendicular, line, drawn, through, it, and, turned, round, thus, at, the, top, being, the, cipher, of, christ, having, this, sign, his, troops, stood, to, arms, eusebius, describes, a, vision, that, constantine, had, while, marching, at, midday, in, which, he, saw, with, his, own, eyes, the, trophy, of, a, cross, of, light, in, the, heavens, above, the, sun, and, bearing, the, inscription, in, hoc, signo, vinces, in, this, sign, thou, shalt, conquer, in, eusebius, s, account, constantine, had, a, dream, the, following, night, in, which, christ, appeared, with, the, same, heavenly, sign, and, told, him, to, make, an, army, standard, in, the, form, of, the, labarum, eusebius, is, vague, about, when, and, where, these, events, took, place, but, it, enters, his, narrative, before, the, war, begins, against, maxentius, he, describes, the, sign, as, chi, traversed, by, rho, to, form, representing, the, first, two, letters, of, the, greek, word, christos, a, medallion, was, issued, at, ticinum, in, 315, which, shows, constantine, wearing, a, helmet, emblazoned, with, the, chi, rho, and, coins, issued, at, siscia, in, 317, 318, repeat, the, image, the, figure, was, otherwise, rare, and, is, uncommon, in, imperial, iconography, and, propaganda, before, the, 320s, it, was, not, completely, unknown, however, being, an, abbreviation, of, the, greek, word, chr, ston, good, having, previously, appeared, on, the, coins, of, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, in, the, 3rd, century, bc, following, constantine, centuries, of, christians, invoked, the, miraculous, or, the, supernatural, when, justifying, or, describing, their, warfare, constantine, deployed, his, own, forces, along, the, whole, length, of, maxentius, line, he, ordered, his, cavalry, to, charge, and, they, broke, maxentius, cavalry, he, then, sent, his, infantry, against, maxentius, infantry, pushing, many, into, the, tiber, where, they, were, slaughtered, and, drowned, the, battle, was, brief, and, maxentius, troops, were, broken, before, the, first, charge, his, horse, guards, and, praetorians, initially, held, their, position, but, they, broke, under, the, force, of, a, constantinian, cavalry, charge, they, also, broke, ranks, and, fled, to, the, river, maxentius, rode, with, them, and, attempted, to, cross, the, bridge, of, boats, ponte, milvio, but, he, was, pushed, into, the, tiber, and, drowned, by, the, mass, of, his, fleeing, soldiers, constantine, entered, rome, on, 29, october, 312, and, staged, a, grand, adventus, in, the, city, which, was, met, with, jubilation, maxentius, body, was, fished, out, of, the, tiber, and, decapitated, and, his, head, was, paraded, through, the, streets, for, all, to, see, after, the, ceremonies, the, disembodied, head, was, sent, to, carthage, and, carthage, offered, no, further, resistance, unlike, his, predecessors, constantine, neglected, to, make, the, trip, to, the, capitoline, hill, and, perform, customary, sacrifices, at, the, temple, of, jupiter, however, he, did, visit, the, senatorial, curia, julia, and, he, promised, to, restore, its, ancestral, privileges, and, give, it, a, secure, role, in, his, reformed, government, there, would, be, no, revenge, against, maxentius, supporters, in, response, the, senate, decreed, him, title, of, the, first, name, which, meant, that, his, name, would, be, listed, first, in, all, official, documents, and, they, acclaimed, him, as, the, greatest, augustus, he, issued, decrees, returning, property, that, was, lost, under, maxentius, recalling, political, exiles, and, releasing, maxentius, imprisoned, opponents, an, extensive, propaganda, campaign, followed, during, which, maxentius, image, was, purged, from, all, public, places, he, was, written, up, as, a, tyrant, and, set, against, an, idealised, image, of, constantine, the, liberator, eusebius, is, the, best, representative, of, this, strand, of, constantinian, propaganda, maxentius, rescripts, were, declared, invalid, and, the, honours, that, he, had, granted, to, leaders, of, the, senate, were, also, invalidated, constantine, also, attempted, to, remove, maxentius, influence, on, rome, s, urban, landscape, all, structures, built, by, him, were, rededicated, to, constantine, including, the, temple, of, romulus, and, the, basilica, of, maxentius, at, the, focal, point, of, the, basilica, a, stone, statue, was, erected, of, constantine, holding, the, christian, labarum, in, its, hand, its, inscription, bore, the, message, which, the, statue, illustrated, by, this, sign, constantine, had, freed, rome, from, the, yoke, of, the, tyrant, constantine, also, sought, to, upstage, maxentius, achievements, for, example, the, circus, maximus, was, redeveloped, so, that, its, seating, capacity, was, 25, times, larger, than, that, of, maxentius, racing, complex, on, the, via, appia, maxentius, strongest, military, supporters, were, neutralised, when, he, disbanded, the, praetorian, guard, and, imperial, horse, guard, the, tombstones, of, the, imperial, horse, guard, were, ground, up, and, used, in, a, basilica, on, the, via, labicana, and, their, former, base, was, redeveloped, into, the, lateran, basilica, on, 9, november, 312, barely, two, weeks, after, constantine, captured, the, city, the, legio, ii, parthica, was, removed, from, albano, laziale, and, the, remainder, of, maxentius, armies, were, sent, to, do, frontier, duty, on, the, rhine, in, the, following, years, constantine, gradually, consolidated, his, military, superiority, over, his, rivals, in, the, crumbling, tetrarchy, in, 313, he, met, licinius, in, milan, to, secure, their, alliance, by, the, marriage, of, licinius, and, constantine, s, half, sister, constantia, during, this, meeting, the, emperors, agreed, on, the, so, called, edict, of, milan, officially, granting, full, tolerance, to, christianity, and, all, religions, in, the, empire, the, document, had, special, benefits, for, christians, legalizing, their, religion, and, granting, them, restoration, for, all, property, seized, during, diocletian, s, persecution, it, repudiates, past, methods, of, religious, coercion, and, used, only, general, terms, to, refer, to, the, divine, sphere, divinity, and, supreme, divinity, summa, divinitas, the, conference, was, cut, short, however, when, news, reached, licinius, that, his, rival, maximinus, had, crossed, the, bosporus, and, invaded, european, territory, licinius, departed, and, eventually, defeated, maximinus, gaining, control, over, the, entire, eastern, half, of, the, roman, empire, relations, between, the, two, remaining, emperors, deteriorated, as, constantine, suffered, an, assassination, attempt, at, the, hands, of, a, character, that, licinius, wanted, elevated, to, the, rank, of, caesar, licinius, for, his, part, had, constantine, s, statues, in, emona, destroyed, in, either, 314, or, 316, the, two, augusti, fought, against, one, another, at, the, battle, of, cibalae, with, constantine, being, victorious, they, clashed, again, at, the, battle, of, mardia, in, 317, and, agreed, to, a, settlement, in, which, constantine, s, sons, crispus, and, constantine, ii, and, licinius, son, licinianus, were, made, caesars, after, this, arrangement, constantine, ruled, the, dioceses, of, pannonia, and, macedonia, and, took, residence, at, sirmium, whence, he, could, wage, war, on, the, goths, and, sarmatians, in, 322, and, on, the, goths, in, 323, defeating, and, killing, their, leader, rausimod, in, 320, licinius, allegedly, reneged, on, the, religious, freedom, promised, by, the, edict, of, milan, and, began, to, oppress, christians, anew, generally, without, bloodshed, but, resorting, to, confiscations, and, sacking, of, christian, office, holders, although, this, characterization, of, licinius, as, anti, christian, is, somewhat, doubtful, the, fact, is, that, he, seems, to, have, been, far, less, open, in, his, support, of, christianity, than, constantine, therefore, licinius, was, prone, to, see, the, church, as, a, force, more, loyal, to, constantine, than, to, the, imperial, system, in, general, as, the, explanation, offered, by, the, church, historian, sozomen, this, dubious, arrangement, eventually, became, a, challenge, to, constantine, in, the, west, climaxing, in, the, great, civil, war, of, 324, constantine, s, christian, eulogists, present, the, war, as, a, battle, between, christianity, and, paganism, licinius, aided, by, gothic, mercenaries, represented, the, past, and, ancient, paganism, while, constantine, and, his, franks, marched, under, the, standard, of, the, labarum, outnumbered, but, fired, by, their, zeal, constantine, s, army, emerged, victorious, in, the, battle, of, adrianople, licinius, fled, across, the, bosphorus, and, appointed, martinian, his, magister, officiorum, as, nominal, augustus, in, the, west, but, constantine, next, won, the, battle, of, the, hellespont, and, finally, the, battle, of, chrysopolis, on, 18, september, 324, licinius, and, martinian, surrendered, to, constantine, at, nicomedia, on, the, promise, their, lives, would, be, spared, they, were, sent, to, live, as, private, citizens, in, thessalonica, and, cappadocia, respectively, but, in, 325, constantine, accused, licinius, of, plotting, against, him, and, had, them, both, arrested, and, hanged, licinius, son, the, son, of, constantine, s, half, sister, was, killed, in, 326, thus, constantine, became, the, sole, emperor, of, the, roman, empire, diocletian, had, chosen, nicomedia, in, the, east, as, his, capital, during, the, tetrarchy, not, far, from, byzantium, well, situated, to, defend, thrace, asia, and, egypt, all, of, which, had, required, his, military, attention, constantine, had, recognised, the, shift, of, the, empire, from, the, remote, and, depopulated, west, to, the, richer, cities, of, the, east, and, the, military, strategic, importance, of, protecting, the, danube, from, barbarian, excursions, and, asia, from, a, hostile, persia, in, choosing, his, new, capital, as, well, as, being, able, to, monitor, shipping, traffic, between, the, black, sea, and, the, mediterranean, licinius, defeat, came, to, represent, the, defeat, of, a, rival, centre, of, pagan, and, greek, speaking, political, activity, in, the, east, as, opposed, to, the, christian, and, latin, speaking, rome, and, it, was, proposed, that, a, new, eastern, capital, should, represent, the, integration, of, the, east, into, the, roman, empire, as, a, whole, as, a, centre, of, learning, prosperity, and, cultural, preservation, for, the, whole, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, among, the, various, locations, proposed, for, this, alternative, capital, constantine, appears, to, have, toyed, earlier, with, serdica, present, day, sofia, as, he, was, reported, saying, that, serdica, is, my, rome, sirmium, and, thessalonica, were, also, considered, eventually, however, constantine, decided, to, work, on, the, greek, city, of, byzantium, which, offered, the, advantage, of, having, already, been, extensively, rebuilt, on, roman, patterns, of, urbanism, during, the, preceding, century, by, septimius, severus, and, caracalla, who, had, already, acknowledged, its, strategic, importance, the, city, was, thus, founded, in, 324, dedicated, on, 11, may, 330, and, renamed, constantinopolis, constantine, s, city, or, constantinople, in, english, special, commemorative, coins, were, issued, in, 330, to, honor, the, event, the, new, city, was, protected, by, the, relics, of, the, true, cross, the, rod, of, moses, and, other, holy, relics, though, a, cameo, now, at, the, hermitage, museum, also, represented, constantine, crowned, by, the, tyche, of, the, new, city, the, figures, of, old, gods, were, either, replaced, or, assimilated, into, a, framework, of, christian, symbolism, constantine, built, the, new, church, of, the, holy, apostles, on, the, site, of, a, temple, to, aphrodite, generations, later, there, was, the, story, that, a, divine, vision, led, constantine, to, this, spot, and, an, angel, no, one, else, could, see, led, him, on, a, circuit, of, the, new, walls, the, capital, would, often, be, compared, to, the, old, rome, as, nova, roma, constantinopolitana, the, new, rome, of, constantinople, constantine, was, the, first, emperor, to, stop, the, persecution, of, christians, and, to, legalize, christianity, along, with, all, other, religions, cults, in, the, roman, empire, in, february, 313, he, met, with, licinius, in, milan, and, developed, the, edict, of, milan, which, stated, that, christians, should, be, allowed, to, follow, their, faith, without, oppression, this, removed, penalties, for, professing, christianity, under,

worship, any, deity, that, they, chose, a, similar, edict, had, been, issued, in, 311, by, galerius, senior, emperor, of, the, tetrarchy, which, granted, christians, the, right, to, practise, their, religion, but, did, not, restore, any, property, to, them, the, edict, of, milan, included, several, clauses, which, stated, that, all, confiscated, churches, would, be, returned, as, well, as, other, provisions, for, previously, persecuted, christians, some, scholars, think, that, helena, adopted, christianity, as, an, adult, and, according, to, eusebius, she, was, converted, by, constantine, but, other, historians, debate, whether, constantine, adopted, his, mother, helena, s, christianity, in, his, youth, or, whether, he, adopted, it, gradually, over, the, course, of, his, life, constantine, possibly, retained, the, title, of, pontifex, maximus, which, emperors, bore, as, heads, of, the, ancient, roman, religion, until, gratian, renounced, the, title, according, to, christian, writers, constantine, was, over, 40, when, he, finally, declared, himself, a, christian, making, it, clear, that, he, owed, his, successes, to, the, protection, of, the, christian, high, god, alone, despite, these, declarations, of, being, a, christian, he, waited, to, be, baptised, on, his, deathbed, believing, that, the, baptism, would, release, him, of, any, sins, he, committed, in, the, course, of, carrying, out, his, policies, while, emperor, he, supported, the, church, financially, built, basilicas, granted, privileges, to, clergy, such, as, exemption, from, certain, taxes, promoted, christians, to, high, office, and, returned, property, confiscated, during, the, long, period, of, persecution, his, most, famous, building, projects, include, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, old, st, peter, s, basilica, in, constructing, the, old, st, peter, s, basilica, constantine, went, to, great, lengths, to, erect, the, basilica, on, top, of, st, peter, s, resting, place, so, much, so, that, it, even, affected, the, design, of, the, basilica, including, the, challenge, of, erecting, it, on, the, hill, where, st, peter, rested, making, its, complete, construction, time, over, 30, years, from, the, date, constantine, ordered, it, to, be, built, constantine, might, not, have, patronised, christianity, alone, a, triumphal, arch, was, built, in, 315, to, celebrate, his, victory, in, the, battle, of, the, milvian, bridge, which, was, decorated, with, images, of, the, goddess, victoria, and, sacrifices, were, made, to, pagan, gods, at, its, dedication, including, apollo, diana, and, hercules, absent, from, the, arch, are, any, depictions, of, christian, symbolism, however, the, arch, was, commissioned, by, the, senate, so, the, absence, of, christian, symbols, may, reflect, the, role, of, the, curia, at, the, time, as, a, pagan, redoubt, in, 321, he, legislated, that, the, venerable, sunday, should, be, a, day, of, rest, for, all, citizens, in, 323, he, issued, a, decree, banning, christians, from, participating, in, state, sacrifices, after, the, pagan, gods, had, disappeared, from, his, coinage, christian, symbols, appeared, as, constantine, s, attributes, the, chi, rho, between, his, hands, or, on, his, labarum, as, well, on, the, coinage, the, reign, of, constantine, established, a, precedent, for, the, emperor, to, have, great, influence, and, authority, in, the, early, christian, councils, most, notably, the, dispute, over, arianism, constantine, disliked, the, risks, to, societal, stability, that, religious, disputes, and, controversies, brought, with, them, preferring, to, establish, an, orthodoxy, his, influence, over, the, church, councils, was, to, enforce, doctrine, root, out, heresy, and, uphold, ecclesiastical, unity, the, church, s, role, was, to, determine, proper, worship, doctrines, and, dogma, north, african, bishops, struggled, with, christian, bishops, who, had, been, ordained, by, donatus, in, opposition, to, caecilian, from, 313, to, 316, the, african, bishops, could, not, come, to, terms, and, the, donatists, asked, constantine, to, act, as, a, judge, in, the, dispute, three, regional, church, councils, and, another, trial, before, constantine, all, ruled, against, donatus, and, the, donatism, movement, in, north, africa, in, 317, constantine, issued, an, edict, to, confiscate, donatist, church, property, and, to, send, donatist, clergy, into, exile, more, significantly, in, 325, he, summoned, the, first, council, of, nicaea, most, known, for, its, dealing, with, arianism, and, for, instituting, the, nicene, creed, he, enforced, the, council, s, prohibition, against, celebrating, the, lord, s, supper, on, the, day, before, the, jewish, passover, which, marked, a, definite, break, of, christianity, from, the, judaic, tradition, from, then, on, the, solar, julian, calendar, was, given, precedence, over, the, lunisolar, hebrew, calendar, among, the, christian, churches, of, the, roman, empire, constantine, made, some, new, laws, regarding, the, jews, some, of, them, were, unfavourable, towards, jews, although, they, were, not, harsher, than, those, of, his, predecessors, it, was, made, illegal, for, jews, to, seek, converts, or, to, attack, other, jews, who, had, converted, to, christianity, they, were, forbidden, to, own, christian, slaves, or, to, circumcise, their, slaves, on, the, other, hand, jewish, clergy, were, given, the, same, exemptions, as, christian, clergy, beginning, in, the, mid, 3rd, century, the, emperors, began, to, favour, members, of, the, equestrian, order, over, senators, who, had, a, monopoly, on, the, most, important, offices, of, the, state, senators, were, stripped, of, the, command, of, legions, and, most, provincial, governorships, as, it, was, felt, that, they, lacked, the, specialised, military, upbringing, needed, in, an, age, of, acute, defense, needs, such, posts, were, given, to, equestrians, by, diocletian, and, his, colleagues, following, a, practice, enforced, piecemeal, by, their, predecessors, the, emperors, however, still, needed, the, talents, and, the, help, of, the, very, rich, who, were, relied, on, to, maintain, social, order, and, cohesion, by, means, of, a, web, of, powerful, influence, and, contacts, at, all, levels, exclusion, of, the, old, senatorial, aristocracy, threatened, this, arrangement, in, 326, constantine, reversed, this, pro, equestrian, trend, raising, many, administrative, positions, to, senatorial, rank, and, thus, opening, these, offices, to, the, old, aristocracy, at, the, same, time, he, elevated, the, rank, of, existing, equestrian, office, holders, to, senator, degrading, the, equestrian, order, in, the, process, at, least, as, a, bureaucratic, rank, the, title, of, perfectissimus, was, granted, only, to, mid, or, low, level, officials, by, the, end, of, the, 4th, century, by, the, new, constantinian, arrangement, one, could, become, a, senator, by, being, elected, praetor, or, by, fulfilling, a, function, of, senatorial, rank, from, then, on, holding, actual, power, and, social, status, were, melded, together, into, a, joint, imperial, hierarchy, constantine, gained, the, support, of, the, old, nobility, with, this, as, the, senate, was, allowed, to, elect, praetors, and, quaestors, in, place, of, the, usual, practice, of, the, emperors, directly, creating, magistrates, adlectio, an, inscription, in, honor, of, city, prefect, ceionius, rufus, albinus, states, that, constantine, had, restored, the, senate, the, auctoritas, it, had, lost, at, caesar, s, time, the, senate, as, a, body, remained, devoid, of, any, significant, power, nevertheless, the, senators, had, been, marginalised, as, potential, holders, of, imperial, functions, during, the, 3rd, century, but, could, dispute, such, positions, alongside, more, upstart, bureaucrats, some, modern, historians, see, in, those, administrative, reforms, an, attempt, by, constantine, at, reintegrating, the, senatorial, order, into, the, imperial, administrative, elite, to, counter, the, possibility, of, alienating, pagan, senators, from, a, christianised, imperial, rule, however, such, an, interpretation, remains, conjectural, given, the, fact, that, we, do, not, have, the, precise, numbers, about, pre, constantine, conversions, to, christianity, in, the, old, senatorial, milieu, some, historians, suggest, that, early, conversions, among, the, old, aristocracy, were, more, numerous, than, previously, supposed, constantine, s, reforms, had, to, do, only, with, the, civilian, administration, the, military, chiefs, had, risen, from, the, ranks, since, the, crisis, of, the, third, century, but, remained, outside, the, senate, in, which, they, were, included, only, by, constantine, s, children, in, the, 3rd, century, the, production, of, fiat, money, to, pay, for, public, expenses, resulted, in, runaway, inflation, and, diocletian, tried, unsuccessfully, to, re, establish, trustworthy, minting, of, silver, coins, as, well, as, silver, bronze, billon, coins, the, term, billon, meaning, an, alloy, of, precious, and, base, metals, that, is, mostly, base, metal, silver, currency, was, overvalued, in, terms, of, its, actual, metal, content, and, therefore, could, only, circulate, at, much, discounted, rates, constantine, stopped, minting, the, diocletianic, pure, silver, argenteus, soon, after, 305, while, the, billon, currency, continued, to, be, used, until, the, 360s, from, the, early, 300s, on, constantine, forsook, any, attempts, at, restoring, the, silver, currency, preferring, instead, to, concentrate, on, minting, large, quantities, of, the, gold, solidus, 72, of, which, made, a, pound, of, gold, new, and, highly, debased, silver, pieces, continued, to, be, issued, during, his, later, reign, and, after, his, death, in, a, continuous, process, of, retariffing, until, this, billon, minting, ceased, in, 367, and, the, silver, piece, was, continued, by, various, denominations, of, bronze, coins, the, most, important, being, the, centenionalis, these, bronze, pieces, continued, to, be, devalued, assuring, the, possibility, of, keeping, fiduciary, minting, alongside, a, gold, standard, the, author, of, de, rebus, bellicis, held, that, the, rift, widened, between, classes, because, of, this, monetary, policy, the, rich, benefited, from, the, stability, in, purchasing, power, of, the, gold, piece, while, the, poor, had, to, cope, with, ever, degrading, bronze, pieces, later, emperors, such, as, julian, the, apostate, insisted, on, trustworthy, mintings, of, the, bronze, currency, constantine, s, monetary, policies, were, closely, associated, with, his, religious, policies, increased, minting, was, associated, with, the, confiscation, of, all, gold, silver, and, bronze, statues, from, pagan, temples, between, 331, and, 336, which, were, declared, to, be, imperial, property, two, imperial, commissioners, for, each, province, had, the, task, of, getting, the, statues, and, melting, them, for, immediate, minting, with, the, exception, of, a, number, of, bronze, statues, that, were, used, as, public, monuments, in, constantinople, constantine, had, his, eldest, son, crispus, seized, and, put, to, death, by, cold, poison, at, pola, pula, croatia, sometime, between, 15, may, and, 17, june, 326, in, july, he, had, his, wife, empress, fausta, stepmother, of, crispus, killed, in, an, overheated, bath, their, names, were, wiped, from, the, face, of, many, inscriptions, references, to, their, lives, were, eradicated, from, the, literary, record, and, their, memory, was, condemned, eusebius, for, example, edited, out, any, praise, of, crispus, from, later, copies, of, historia, ecclesiastica, and, his, vita, constantini, contains, no, mention, of, fausta, or, crispus, few, ancient, sources, are, willing, to, discuss, possible, motives, for, the, events, and, the, few, that, do, are, of, later, provenance, and, are, generally, unreliable, at, the, time, of, the, executions, it, was, commonly, believed, that, empress, fausta, was, either, in, an, illicit, relationship, with, crispus, or, was, spreading, rumors, to, that, effect, a, popular, myth, arose, modified, to, allude, to, the, hippolytus, phaedra, legend, with, the, suggestion, that, constantine, killed, crispus, and, fausta, for, their, immoralities, the, largely, fictional, passion, of, artemius, explicitly, makes, this, connection, the, myth, rests, on, slim, evidence, as, an, interpretation, of, the, executions, only, late, and, unreliable, sources, allude, to, the, relationship, between, crispus, and, fausta, and, there, is, no, evidence, for, the, modern, suggestion, that, constantine, s, godly, edicts, of, 326, and, the, irregularities, of, crispus, are, somehow, connected, although, constantine, created, his, apparent, heirs, caesars, following, a, pattern, established, by, diocletian, he, gave, his, creations, a, hereditary, character, alien, to, the, tetrarchic, system, constantine, s, caesars, were, to, be, kept, in, the, hope, of, ascending, to, empire, and, entirely, subordinated, to, their, augustus, as, long, as, he, was, alive, adrian, goldsworthy, speculates, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, execution, of, crispus, was, constantine, s, desire, to, keep, a, firm, grip, on, his, prospective, heirs, this, and, fausta, s, desire, for, having, her, sons, inheriting, instead, of, their, half, brother, being, reason, enough, for, killing, crispus, the, subsequent, execution, of, fausta, however, was, probably, meant, as, a, reminder, to, her, children, that, constantine, would, not, hesitate, in, killing, his, own, relatives, when, he, felt, this, was, necessary, constantine, considered, constantinople, his, capital, and, permanent, residence, he, lived, there, for, a, good, portion, of, his, later, life,

a, persian, client, on, the, throne, constantine, then, resolved, to, campaign, against, persia, he, treated, the, war, as, a, christian, crusade, calling, for, bishops, to, accompany, the, army, and, commissioning, a, tent, in, the, shape, of, a, church, to, follow, him, everywhere, constantine, planned, to, be, baptised, in, the, jordan, river, before, crossing, into, persia, persian, diplomats, came, to, constantinople, over, the, winter, of, 336, 337, seeking, peace, but, constantine, turned, them, away, the, campaign, was, called, off, however, when, constantine, became, sick, in, the, spring, of, 337, from, his, recent, illness, constantine, knew, death, would, soon, come, within, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, constantine, had, secretly, prepared, a, final, resting, place, for, himself, it, came, sooner, than, he, had, expected, soon, after, the, feast, of, easter, 337, constantine, fell, seriously, ill, he, left, constantinople, for, the, hot, baths, near, his, mother,

suburb, of, nicomedia, he, summoned, the, bishops, and, told, them, of, his, hope, to, be, baptised, in, the, river, jordan, where, christ, was, written, to, have, been, baptised, he, requested, the, baptism, right, away, promising, to, live, a, more, christian, life, should, he, live, through, his, illness, the, bishops, eusebius, records, performed, the, sacred, ceremonies, according, to, custom, he, chose, the, arian, bishop, eusebius, of, nicomedia, bishop, of, the, city, where, he, lay, dying, as, his, baptizer, in, postponing, his, baptism, he, followed, one, custom, at, the, time, which, postponed, baptism, until, after, infancy, it, has, been, thought, that, constantine, put, off, baptism, as, long, as, he, did, so, as, to, be, absolved, from, as, much, of, his, sin, as, possible, constantine, died, soon, after, at, a, suburban, villa, called, achyron, on, the, last, day, of, the, fifty, day, festival, of, pentecost, directly, following, pascha, or, easter, on, 22, may, 337, although, constantine, s, death, follows, the, conclusion, of, the, persian, campaign, in, eusebius, s, account, most, other, sources, report, his, death, as, occurring, in, its, middle, emperor, julian, a, nephew, of, constantine, writing, in, the, mid, 350s, observes, that, the, sassanians, escaped, punishment, for, their, ill, deeds, because, constantine, died, in, the, middle, of, his, preparations, for, war, similar, accounts, are, given, in, the, origo, constantini, an, anonymous, document, composed, while, constantine, was, still, living, which, has, constantine, dying, in, nicomedia, the, historiae, abbreviatae, of, sextus, aurelius, victor, written, in, 361, which, has, constantine, dying, at, an, estate, near, nicomedia, called, achyrona, while, marching, against,

these, and, other, accounts, some, have, concluded, that, eusebius, s, vita, was, edited, to, defend, constantine, s, reputation, against, what, eusebius, saw, as, a, less, congenial, version, of, the, campaign, following, his, death, his, body, was, transferred, to, constantinople, and, buried, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, in, a, porphyry, sarcophagus, that, was, described, in, the, 10th, century, by, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, in, the, de, ceremoniis, his, body, survived, the, plundering, of, the, city, during, the, fourth, crusade, in, 1204, but, was, destroyed,

already, received, one, division, of, the, empire, each, to, administer, as, caesars, constantine, may, have, intended, his, successors, to, resume, a, structure, akin, to, diocletian, s, tetrarchy,

possible, contenders, to, an, already, complicated, succession, he, also, had, two, daughters, constantina, and, helena, wife, of, emperor, julian, constantine, reunited, the, empire, under, one, emperor, and, he, won, major, victories, over, the, franks, and, alamanni, in, 306, 308, the, franks, again, in, 313, 314, the, goths, in, 332, and, the, sarmatians, in, 334, by, 336, he, had,

which, does, not, speculate, on, the, origin, of, constantine, s, christian, motivation, but, presents, him, as, a, religious, revolutionary, who, fervently, believed, that, he, was, meant, to, play, a, providential, role, in, the, millenary, economy, of, the, salvation, of, humanity, peter, heather, argues, that, it, is, most, plausible, that, constantine, had, been, a, christian, considerably, before, 312, possibly, even, for, his, entire, life, with, the, public, timeline, of, events, instead, reflecting, his, coming, out, as, christian, in, stages, as, doing, so, became, politically, viable, as, a, parallel, illustrating, the, cogency, of, this, interpretation, heather, gestures, to, the, later, conversion, of, constantine, s, nephew, julian, from, christianity, to, hellenism, after, which, he, practiced, in, secret, for, a, decade, latin, christians, considered, it, inappropriate, that, constantine, was, baptised, only, on, his, death, bed, by, an, unorthodox, bishop, and, a, legend, emerged, by, the, early, 4th, century, that, pope, sylvester, i, had, cured, the, pagan, emperor, from, leprosy, according, to, this, legend, constantine, was, baptised, and, began, the, construction, of, a, church, in, the, lateran, basilica, the, donation, of, constantine, appeared, in, the, 8th, century, most, likely, during, the, pontificate, of, pope, stephen, ii, in, which, the, freshly, converted, constantine, gives, the, city, of, rome, and, all, the, provinces, districts, and, cities, of, italy, and, the, western, regions, to, sylvester, and, his, successors, in, the, high, middle, ages, this, document, was, used, and, accepted, as, the, basis, for, the, pope, s, temporal, power, though, it, was, denounced, as, a, forgery, by, emperor, otto, iii, and, lamented, as, the, root, of, papal, worldliness, by, dante, alighieri, philologist, and, catholic, priest, lorenzo, valla, proved, in, 1440, that, the, document, was, indeed, a, forgery, during, the, medieval, period, britons, regarded, constantine, as, a, king, of, their, own, people, particularly, associating, him, with, caernarfon, in, gwynedd, while, some, of, this, is, owed, to, his, fame, and, his,
