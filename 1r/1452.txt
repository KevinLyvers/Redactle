1880, clemenceau, started, his, newspaper, la, justice, which, became, the, principal, organ, of, parisian, radicalism, from, this, time, throughout, the, presidency, of, jules, gr, vy, 1879, 1887, he, became, widely, known, as, a, political, critic, and, destroyer, of, ministries, le, tombeur, de, minist, res, who, avoided, taking, office, himself, leading, the, far, left, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, he, was, an, active, opponent, of, the, colonial, policy, of, prime, minister, jules, ferry, which, he, opposed, on, moral, grounds, and, also, as, a, form, of, diversion, from, the, more, important, goal, of, revenge, against, germany, for, the, annexation, of, alsace, and, lorraine, after, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1885, his, criticism, of, the, conduct, of, the, sino, french, war, contributed, strongly, to, the, fall, of, the, ferry, cabinet, that, year, during, the, french, legislative, elections, of, 1885, he, advocated, a, strong, radical, programme, and, was, returned, both, for, his, old, seat, in, paris, and, for, the, var, district, of, draguignan, he, chose, to, represent, the, latter, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, refusing, to, form, a, ministry, to, replace, the, one, he, had, overthrown, he, supported, the, right, in, keeping, prime, minister, charles, de, freycinet, in, power, in, 1886, and, was, responsible, for, the, inclusion, of, georges, ernest, boulanger, in, the, freycinet, cabinet, as, war, minister, when, general, boulanger, revealed, himself, as, an, ambitious, pretender, clemenceau, withdrew, his, support, and, became, a, vigorous, opponent, of, the, heterogeneous, boulangist, movement, although, the, radical, press, continued, to, patronize, the, general, by, his, exposure, of, the, wilson, scandal, and, by, his, personal, plain, speaking, clemenceau, contributed, largely, to, the, resignation, of, jules, gr, vy, from, the, presidency, of, france, in, 1887, he, had, declined, gr, vy, s, request, to, form, a, cabinet, upon, the, downfall, of, the, cabinet, of, maurice, rouvier, by, advising, his, followers, not, to, vote, for, charles, floquet, jules, ferry, nor, charles, de, freycinet, clemenceau, was, primarily, responsible, for, the, election, of, an, outsider, marie, fran, ois, sadi, carnot, as, president, the, split, in, the, radical, party, over, boulangism, weakened, his, hand, and, its, collapse, meant, that, moderate, republicans, did, not, need, his, help, a, further, misfortune, occurred, in, the, panama, affair, as, clemenceau, s, relations, with, the, businessman, and, politician, cornelius, herz, led, to, his, being, included, in, the, general, suspicion, in, response, to, accusations, of, corruption, levelled, by, the, nationalist, politician, paul, d, roul, de, clemenceau, fought, a, duel, with, him, on, 23, december, 1892, six, shots, were, discharged, but, neither, participant, was, injured, clemenceau, remained, the, leading, spokesman, for, french, radicalism, but, his, hostility, to, the, franco, russian, alliance, so, increased, his, unpopularity, that, in, the, french, legislative, elections, of, 1893, he, was, defeated, for, his, seat, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, after, having, held, it, continuously, since, 1876, for, nearly, a, decade, after, his, 1893, defeat, clemenceau, confined, his, political, activities, to, journalism, his, career, was, further, clouded, by, the, long, drawn, out, dreyfus, case, in, which, he, took, an, active, part, as, a, supporter, of, mile, zola, and, an, opponent, of, the, anti, semitic, and, nationalist, campaigns, in, all, during, the, affair, clemenceau, published, 665, articles, defending, dreyfus, on, 13, january, 1898, clemenceau, published, mile, zola, s, j, accuse, on, the, front, page, of, the, paris, daily, newspaper, l, aurore, of, which, he, was, owner, and, editor, he, decided, to, run, the, controversial, article, that, would, become, a, famous, part, of, the, dreyfus, affair, in, the, form, of, an, open, letter, to, f, lix, faure, the, president, of, france, in, 1900, he, withdrew, from, la, justice, to, found, a, weekly, review, le, bloc, to, which, he, practically, was, the, sole, contributor, the, publication, of, le, bloc, lasted, until, 15, march, 1902, on, 6, april, 1902, he, was, elected, senator, for, the, var, district, of, draguignan, although, he, had, previously, called, for, the, suppression, of, the, french, senate, as, he, considered, it, a, strong, house, of, conservatism, he, served, as, the, senator, for, draguignan, until, 1920, clemenceau, sat, with, the, independent, radicals, in, the, senate, and, moderated, his, positions, although, he, still, vigorously, supported, the, radical, socialist, ministry, of, prime, minister, mile, combes, who, spearheaded, the, anti, clericalist, republican, struggle, in, june, 1903, he, undertook, the, direction, of, l, aurore, the, journal, that, he, had, founded, in, it, he, led, the, campaign, to, revisit, the, dreyfus, affair, and, to, create, a, separation, of, church, and, state, in, france, the, latter, was, implemented, by, the, 1905, french, law, on, the, separation, of, the, churches, and, the, state, in, march, 1906, the, ministry, of, maurice, rouvier, fell, as, a, result, of, civil, disturbances, provoked, by, the, implementation, of, the, law, on, the, separation, of, church, and, state, and, the, victory, of, radicals, in, the, french, legislative, elections, of, 1906, the, new, government, of, ferdinand, sarrien, appointed, clemenceau, as,

nicknamed, brigades, du, tigre, the, tiger, s, brigades, after, clemenceau, who, was, nicknamed, the, tiger, the, miners, strike, in, the, pas, de, calais, after, the, courri, res, mine, disaster, which, resulted, in, the, death, of, more, than, one, thousand, persons, threatened, widespread, disorder, on, 1, may, 1906, clemenceau, ordered, the, military, against, the, strikers, and, repressed, the, wine, growers, strike, in, the, languedoc, roussillon, his, actions, alienated, the, french, section, of, the, workers, international, sfio, socialist, party, from, which, he, definitively, broke, in, his, notable, reply, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, to, jean, jaur, s, leader, of, the, sfio, in, june, 1906, clemenceau, s, speech, positioned, him, as, the, strong, man, of, the, day, in, french, politics, when, the, sarrien, ministry, resigned, in, october, clemenceau, became, premier, after, a, proposal, by, the, deputy, paul, dussaussoy, for, limited, women, s, suffrage, in, local, elections, clemenceau, published, a, pamphlet, in, 1907, in, which, he, declared, that, if, women, were, given, the, vote, france, would, return, to, the, middle, ages, as, the, revolt, of, the, languedoc, winegrowers, developed, clemenceau, at, first, dismissed, the, complaints, then, sent, in, troops, to, keep, the, peace, in, june, 1907, during, 1907, and, 1908, he, led, the, development, of, a, new, entente, cordiale, with, britain, which, gave, france, a, successful, role, in, european, politics, difficulties, with, germany, and, criticism, by, the, socialist, party, in, connection, with, the, handling, of, the, first, moroccan, crisis, in, 1905, 06, were, settled, at, the, algeciras, conference, clemenceau, was, defeated, on, 20, july, 1909, in, a, discussion, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, on, the, state, of, the, navy, in, which, bitter, words, he, exchanged, with, th, ophile, delcass, the, former, president, of, the, council, whose, downfall, clemenceau, had, aided, refusing, to, respond, to, delcass, s, technical, questions, clemenceau, resigned, after, his, proposal, for, the, order, of, the, day, vote, was, rejected, he, was, succeeded, as, premier, by, aristide, briand, with, a, reconstructed, cabinet, between, 1909, and, 1912, clemenceau, dedicated, his, time, to, travel, conferences, and, the, treatment, of, his, illness, he, went, to, south, america, in, 1910, traveling, to, brazil, uruguay, and, argentina, where, he, went, as, far, as, santa, ana, tucuman, in, northwest, argentina, there, he, was, amazed, by, the, influence, of, french, culture, and, of, the, french, revolution, on, local, elites, he, published, the, first, issue, of, the, journal, du, var, on, 10, april, 1910, three, years, later, on, 6, may, 1913, he, founded, l, homme, libre, the, free, man, newspaper, in, paris, for, which, he, wrote, a, daily, editorial, in, these, media, clemenceau, focused, increasingly, on, foreign, policy, and, condemned, the, anti, militarism, of, the, socialists, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, france, in, august, 1914, clemenceau, s, newspaper, was, one, of, the, first, to, be, censored, by, the, government, it, was, suspended, from, 29, september, 1914, to, 7, october, in, response, clemenceau, changed, the, newspaper, s, name, to, l, homme, encha, n, the, chained, man, and, criticized, the, government, for, its, lack, of, transparency, and, its, ineffectiveness, while, defending, the, patriotic, union, sacr, e, against, the, german, empire, in, spite, of, the, censorship, imposed, by, the, french, government, on, clemenceau, s, journalism, at, the, beginning, of, world, war, i, he, still, wielded, considerable, political, influence, as, soon, as, the, war, started, clemenceau, advised, interior, minister, malvy, to, invoke, carnet, b, a, list, of, known, and, suspected, subversives, who, were, supposed, to, be, arrested, upon, mobilisation, in, order, to, prevent, the, collapse, of, popular, support, for, a, war, effort, the, prefect, of, police, gave, the, same, advice, but, the, government, did, not, follow, it, in, the, end, 80, of, the, 2, 501, people, listed, on, carnet, b, as, subversives, volunteered, for, service, in, autumn, 1914, clemenceau, declined, to, join, the, government, of, national, unity, as, justice, minister, he, was, a, vehement, critic, of, the, wartime, french, government, asserting, that, it, was, not, doing, enough, to, win, the, war, his, stance, was, driven, by, a, will, to, regain, the, province, of, alsace, lorraine, a, view, shared, by, public, opinion, the, autumn, of, 1917, saw, the, disastrous, italian, defeat, at, the, battle, of, caporetto, the, bolshevik, seizure, of, power, in, russia, and, rumours, that, former, prime, minister, joseph, caillaux, and, interior, minister, louis, malvy, might, have, engaged, in, treason, prime, minister, paul, painlev, was, inclined, to, open, negotiations, with, germany, clemenceau, argued, that, even, german, restitution, of, alsace, lorraine, and, the, liberation, of, belgium, would, not, be, enough, to, justify, france, abandoning, her, allies, this, forced, alexandre, ribot, and, aristide, briand, both, the, previous, two, prime, ministers, of, whom, the, latter, was, by, far, the, more, powerful, politician, who, had, been, approached, by, a, german, diplomat, to, agree, in, public, that, there, would, be, no, separate, peace, for, many, years, clemenceau, was, blamed, for, having, blocked, a, possible, compromise, peace, but, it, is, now, clear, from, examination, of, german, documents, that, germany, had, no, serious, intention, of, handing, over, alsace, lorraine, the, prominence, of, his, opposition, made, him, the, best, known, critic, and, the, last, man, standing, when, the, others, had, failed, messieurs, les, allemands, sont, toujours, noyon, gentlemen, the, germans, are, still, at, noyon, wrote, clemenceau, s, paper, endlessly, in, november, 1917, at, one, of, the, darkest, hours, for, the, french, war, effort, in, world, war, i, clemenceau, was, appointed, to, the, prime, ministership, unlike, his, predecessors, he, discouraged, internal, disagreement, and, called, for, peace, among, the, senior, politicians, clemenceau, governed, from, the, ministry, of, war, on, rue, saint, dominique, almost, his, first, act, as, prime, minister, was, to, relieve, general, maurice, sarrail, from, his, command, of, the, salonika, front, this, was, the, main, topic, of, discussion, at, the, first, meeting, of, the, war, committee, on, 6, december, at, which, clemenceau, stated, sarrail, cannot, remain, there, the, reason, for, sarrail, s, dismissal, was, his, links, with, the, socialist, politicians, joseph, caillaux, and, louis, malvy, at, that, time, suspected, of, treasonable, contacts, with, the, germans, churchill, later, wrote, that, clemenceau, looked, like, a, wild, animal, pacing, to, and, fro, behind, bars, in, front, of, an, assembly, which, would, have, done, anything, to, avoid, putting, him, there, but, having, put, him, there, felt, they, must, obey, when, clemenceau, became, prime, minister, in, 1917, victory, seemed, to, be, elusive, there, was, little, activity, on, the, western, front, because, it, was, believed, that, there, should, be, limited, attacks, until, the, american, support, arrived, at, this, time, italy, was, on, the, defensive, russia, virtually, had, stopped, fighting, and, it, was, believed, that, they, would, be, making, a, separate, peace, with, germany, see, also, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, at, home, the, government, had, to, deal, with, increasing, demonstrations, against, the, war, a, scarcity, of, resources, and, air, raids, that, were, causing, huge, physical, damage, to, paris, as, well, as, undermining, the, morale, of, its, citizens, it, also, was, believed, that, many, politicians, secretly, wanted, peace, it, was, a, challenging, situation, for, clemenceau, after, years, of, criticizing, other, men, during, the, war, he, suddenly, found, himself, in, a, position, of, supreme, power, he, was, isolated, politically, however, he, did, not, have, close, links, with, any, parliamentary, leaders, especially, after, he, had, antagonized, them, so, relentlessly, during, the, course, of, the, war, and, so, had, to, rely, on, himself, and, his, own, circle, of, friends, clemenceau, s, assumption, of, power, meant, little, to, the, men, in, the, trenches, at, first, they, thought, of, him, as, just, another, politician, and, the, monthly, assessment, of, troop, morale, found, that, only, a, minority, found, comfort, in, his, appointment, slowly, however, as, time, passed, the, confidence, he, inspired, in, a, few, began, to, grow, throughout, all, the, fighting, men, they, were, encouraged, by, his, many, visits, to, the, trenches, this, confidence, began, to, spread, from, the, trenches, to, the, home, front, and, it, was, said, we, believed, in, clemenceau, rather, in, the, way, that, our, ancestors, believed, in, joan, of, arc, after, years, of, criticism, against, the, french, army, for, its, conservatism, and, catholicism, clemenceau, would, need, help, to, get, along, with, the, military, leaders, to, achieve, a, sound, strategic, plan, he, nominated, general, henri, mordacq, to, be, his, military, chief, of, staff, mordacq, helped, to, inspire, trust, and, mutual, respect, from, the, army, to, the, government, which, proved, essential, to, the, final, victory, clemenceau, also, was, well, received, by, the, media, because, they, felt, that, france, was, in, need, of, strong, leadership, it, was, widely, recognized, that, throughout, the, war, he, was, never, discouraged, and, never, stopped, believing, that, france, could, achieve, total, victory, there, were, skeptics, however, who, believed, that, clemenceau, like, other, war, time, leaders, would, have, a, short, time, in, office, it, was, said, like, everyone, else, clemenceau, will, not, last, long, only, long, enough, to, clean, up, as, the, military, situation, worsened, in, early, 1918, clemenceau, continued, to, support, the, policy, of, total, war, we, present, ourselves, before, you, with, the, single, thought, of, total, war, and, the, policy, of, la, guerre, jusqu, au, bout, war, until, the, end, his, speech, of, 8, march, advocating, this, policy, was, so, effective, that, it, left, a, vivid, impression, on, winston, churchill, who, would, make, similar, speeches, upon, becoming, british, prime, minister, in, 1940, clemenceau, s, war, policy, encompassed, the, promise, of, victory, with, justice, loyalty, to, the, fighting, men, and, immediate, and, severe, punishment, of, crimes, against, france, joseph, caillaux, a, former, french, prime, minister, disagreed, with, clemenceau, s, policies, he, wanted, to, surrender, to, germany, and, negotiate, a, peace, thus, clemenceau, viewed, caillaux, as, a, threat, to, national, security, unlike, previous, ministers, clemenceau, moved, against, caillaux, publicly, as, a, result, a, parliamentary, committee, decided, that, caillaux, would, be, arrested, and, imprisoned, for, three, years, clemenceau, believed, in, the, words, of, jean, ybarn, garay, that, caillaux, s, crime, was, not, to, have, believed, in, victory, to, have, gambled, on, his, nation, s, defeat, the, arrest, of, caillaux, and, others, raised, the, issue, of, clemenceau, s, harshness, who, in, turn, argued, that, the, only, powers, he, assumed, were, those, necessary, for, winning, the, war, the, many, trials, and, arrests, aroused, great, public, excitement, these, trials, far, from, making, the, public, fear, the, government, inspired, confidence, as, the, public, felt, that, for, the, first, time, in, the, war, action, was, being, taken, and, they, were, being, firmly, governed, the, claims, that, clemenceau, s, firm, government, was, a, dictatorship, found, little, support, clemenceau, was, still, held, accountable, to, the, people, and, media, he, relaxed, censorship, on, political, views, as, he, believed, that, newspapers, had, the, right, to, criticize, political, figures, the, right, to, insult, members, of, the, government, is, inviolable, in, 1918, clemenceau, thought, that, france, should, adopt, woodrow, wilson, s, fourteen, points, mainly, because, of, its, point, that, called, for, the, return, of, alsace, lorraine, to, france, this, meant, that, victory, would, fulfil, the, war, aim, that, was, crucial, for, the, french, public, clemenceau, was, sceptical, about, some, other, points, however, including, those, concerning, the, league, of, nations, as, he, believed, that, the, latter, could, succeed, only, in, a, utopian, society, on, 21, march, 1918, the, germans, began, their, great, spring, offensive, the, allies, were, caught, off, guard, and, a, gap, was, created, in, the, british, and, french, lines, that, risked, handing, over, access, to, paris, to, the, germans, this, defeat, cemented, clemenceau, s, belief, and, that, of, the, other, allies, that, a, coordinated, unified, command, was, the, best, option, it, was, decided, that, ferdinand, foch, would, be, appointed, as, generalissimo, the, german, line, continued, to, advance, and, clemenceau, believed, that, the, fall, of, paris, could, not, be, ruled, out, public, opinions, arose, that, if, the, tiger, as, well, as, foch, and, philippe, p, tain, stayed, in, power, for, even, another, week, france, would, be, lost, and, that, a, government, headed, by, aristide, briand, would, be, beneficial, to, france, because, he, would, make, peace, with, germany, on, advantageous, terms, clemenceau, adamantly, opposed, these, opinions, and, he, gave, an, inspirational, speech, in, the, chamber, of, deputies, the, chamber, subsequently, voted, their, confidence, in, him, by, 377, votes, to, 110, as, the, allied, counter, offensives, began, to, push, the, germans, back, it, became, clear, that, the, germans, could, no, longer, win, the, war, although, they, still, occupied, vast, amounts, of, french, territory, they, did, not, have, sufficient, resources, and, manpower, to, continue, their, attack, as, countries, allied, to, germany, began, to, ask, for, an, armistice, it, was, obvious, that, germany, would, soon, follow, on, 11, november, 1918, an, armistice, with, germany, was, signed, clemenceau, was, embraced, in, the, streets, and, attracted, many, admiring, crowds, to, settle, the, international, political, issues, left, over, from, the, conclusion, of, world, war, i, it, was, decided, that, a, peace, conference, would, be, held, in, paris, france, famously, the, treaty, of, versailles, between, germany, and, the, allied, powers, to, conclude, the, conflict, was, signed, in, the, palace, of, versailles, but, the, deliberations, on, which, it, was, based, were, conducted, in, paris, hence, the, name, given, to, the, meeting, of, the, victorious, heads, of, state, that, produced, the, treaties, signed, with, the, defeated, powers, the, paris, peace, conference, of, 1919, on, 13, december, 1918, united, states, president, woodrow, wilson, received, an, enthusiastic, welcome, in, france, his, fourteen, points, and, the, concept, of, a, league, of, nations, had, made, a, big, impact, on, the, war, weary, french, at, their, first, meeting, clemenceau, realized, that, wilson, was, a, man, of, principle, and, conscience, the, powers, agreed, that, since, the, conference, was, being, held, in, france, clemenceau, would, be, the, most, appropriate, president, also, he, spoke, both, english, and, french, the, official, languages, of, the, conference, clemenceau, had, an, unassailable, position, of, full, control, of, the, french, delegation, parliament, gave, him, a, vote, of, confidence, on, 30, december, 1918, by, a, vote, of, 398, to, 93, the, rules, of, the, conference, allowed, france, five, plenipotentiaries, they, became, clemenceau, and, four, others, who, were, his, pawns, he, excluded, all, military, men, especially, foch, he, excluded, the, president, of, france, raymond, poincar, keeping, him, in, the, dark, on, the, progress, of, negotiations, he, excluded, all, parliamentary, deputies, saying, he, would, negotiate, the, treaty, and, it, would, be, parliament, s, duty, to, vote, it, up, or, down, after, it, was, finished, the, progress, at, the, conference, was, much, slower, than, anticipated, and, decisions, were, being, tabled, constantly, it, was, this, slow, pace, that, induced, clemenceau, to, give, an, interview, showing, his, irritation, to, an, american, journalist, he, said, he, believed, that, germany, had, won, the, war, industrially, and, commercially, as, its, factories, were, intact, and, soon, its, debts, would, be, overcome, through, manipulation, in, a, short, time, he, believed, the, german, economy, would, once, again, be, much, stronger, than, the, french, france, s, leverage, was, jeopardized, repeatedly, by, clemenceau, s, mistrust, of, wilson, and, david, lloyd, george, as, well, as, his, intense, dislike, of, president, poincar, when, negotiations, reached, a, stalemate, clemenceau, had, a, habit, of, shouting, at, the, other, heads, of, state, and, storming, out, of, the, room, rather, than, participating, in, further, discussion, on, 19, february, 1919, as, clemenceau, was, leaving, his, apartment, a, man, fired, several, shots, at, the, car, clemenceau, s, assailant, anarchist, mile, cottin, was, nearly, lynched, clemenceau, s, assistant, found, him, pale, but, conscious, they, shot, me, in, the, back, clemenceau, told, him, they, didn, t, even, dare, to, attack, me, from, the, front, one, bullet, hit, clemenceau, between, the, ribs, just, missing, his, vital, organs, too, dangerous, to, remove, the, bullet, remained, with, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, clemenceau, often, joked, about, the, assassin, s, bad, marksmanship, we, have, just, won, the, most, terrible, war, in, history, yet, here, is, a, frenchman, who, misses, his, target, six, out, of, seven, times, at, point, blank, range, of, course, this, fellow, must, be, punished, for, the, careless, use, of, a, dangerous, weapon, and, for, poor, marksmanship, i, suggest, that, he, be, locked, up, for, eight, years, with, intensive, training, in, a, shooting, gallery, when, clemenceau, returned, to, the, council, of, ten, on, 1, march, he, found, that, little, had, changed, one, issue, that, had, not, changed, at, all, was, the, long, running, dispute, over, france, s, eastern, frontier, and, control, of, the, german, rhineland, clemenceau, believed, that, germany, s, possession, of, this, territory, left, france, without, a, natural, frontier, in, the, east, and, thus, was, vulnerable, to, invasion, the, british, ambassador, reported, in, december, 1918, on, clemenceau, s, views, on, the, future, of, the, rhineland, he, said, that, the, rhine, was, a, natural, boundary, of, gaul, and, germany, and, that, it, ought, to, be, made, the, german, boundary, now, the, territory, between, the, rhine, and, the, french, frontier, being, made, into, an, independent, state, whose, neutrality, should, be, guaranteed, by, the, great, powers, finally, the, issue, was, resolved, when, lloyd, george, and, woodrow, wilson, guaranteed, immediate, military, assistance, if, germany, attacked, without, provocation, it, also, was, decided, that, the, allies, would, occupy, the, territory, for, fifteen, years, and, that, germany, could, never, rearm, the, area, lloyd, george, insisted, on, a, clause, allowing, for, the, early, withdrawal, of, allied, troops, if, the, germans, fulfilled, the, treaty, clemenceau, inserted, article, 429, into, the, treaty, that, permitted, allied, occupation, beyond, the, fifteen, years, if, adequate, guarantees, for, allied, security, against, unprovoked, aggression, were, not, met, this, was, in, case, the, u, s, senate, refused, to, ratify, the, treaty, of, guarantee, thereby, making, null, and, void, the, british, guarantee, as, well, since, that, was, dependent, on, the, americans, being, part, of, it, this, is, in, fact, what, did, occur, article, 429, ensured, that, a, refusal, of, the, u, s, senate, to, ratify, the, treaties, of, guarantee, would, not, weaken, them, president, poincar, and, marshal, ferdinand, foch, both, pressed, repeatedly, for, an, autonomous, rhineland, state, foch, thought, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, too, lenient, on, germany, stating, this, is, not, peace, it, is, an, armistice, for, twenty, years, at, a, cabinet, meeting, on, 25, april, foch, spoke, against, the, deal, clemenceau, had, brokered, and, pushed, for, a, separate, rhineland, on, 28, april, poincar, sent, clemenceau, a, long, letter, detailing, why, he, thought, allied, occupation, should, continue, until, germany, had, paid, all, her, reparations, clemenceau, replied, that, the, alliance, with, america, and, britain, was, of, more, value, than, an, isolated, france, that, held, onto, the, rhineland, in, fifteen, years, i, will, be, dead, but, if, you, do, me, the, honour, of, visiting, my, tomb, you, will, be, able, to, say, that, the, germans, have, not, fulfilled, all, the, clauses, of, the, treaty, and, that, we, are, still, on, the, rhine, clemenceau, said, to, lloyd, george, in, june, we, need, a, barrier, behind, which, in, the, years, to, come, our, people, can, work, in, security, to, rebuild, its, ruins, the, barrier, is, the, rhine, i, must, take, national, feelings, into, account, that, does, not, mean, that, i, am, afraid, of, losing, office, i, am, quite, indifferent, on, that, point, but, i, will, not, by, giving, up, the, occupation, do, something, which, will, break, the, willpower, of, our, people, later, he, said, to, jean, martel, the, policy, of, foch, and, poincar, was, bad, in, principle, it, was, a, policy, no, frenchman, no, republican, frenchman, could, accept, for, a, moment, except, in, the, hope, of, obtaining, other, guarantees, other, advantages, we, leave, that, sort, of, thing, to, bismarck, there, was, increasing, discontent, among, clemenceau, lloyd, george, and, woodrow, wilson, about, slow, progress, and, information, leaks, surrounding, the, council, of, ten, they, began, to, meet, in, a, smaller, group, called, the, council, of, four, vittorio, orlando, of, italy, being, the, fourth, although, less, weighty, member, this, offered, greater, privacy, and, security, and, increased, the, efficiency, of, the, decision, making, process, another, major, issue, that, the, council, of, four, discussed, was, the, future, of, the, german, saar, region, clemenceau, believed, that, france, was, entitled, to, the, region, and, its, coal, mines, after, germany, deliberately, damaged, the, coal, mines, in, northern, france, wilson, however, resisted, the, french, claim, so, firmly, that, clemenceau, accused, him, of, being, pro, german, lloyd, george, came, to, a, compromise, the, coal, mines, were, given, to, france, and, the, territory, placed, under, french, administration, for, 15, years, after, which, a, vote, would, determine, whether, the, region, would, rejoin, germany, although, clemenceau, had, little, knowledge, of, the, defunct, austrian, hungarian, empire, he, supported, the, causes, of, its, smaller, ethnic, groups, and, his, adamant, stance, led, to, the, stringent, terms, in, the, treaty, of, trianon, that, dismantled, hungary, rather, than, recognizing, territories, of, the, austrian, hungarian, empire, solely, within, the, principles, of, self, determination, clemenceau, sought, to, weaken, hungary, just, as, germany, was, and, to, remove, the, threat, of, such, a, large, power, within, central, europe, the, entire, czechoslovakian, state, was, seen, a, potential, buffer, from, communism, and, this, encompassed, majority, hungarian, territories, clemenceau, was, not, experienced, in, the, fields, of, economics, or, finance, and, as, john, maynard, keynes, pointed, out, he, did, not, trouble, his, head, to, understand, either, the, indemnity, or, overwhelming, financial, difficulties, but, he, was, under, strong, public, and, parliamentary, pressure, to, make, germany, s, reparations, bill, as, large, as, possible, generally, it, was, agreed, that, germany, should, not, pay, more, than, it, could, afford, but, the, estimates, of, what, it, could, afford, varied, greatly, figures, ranged, between, 2, 000, million, and, 20, 000, million, clemenceau, realised, that, any, compromise, would, anger, both, the, french, and, british, citizens, and, that, the, only, option, was, to, establish, a, reparations, commission, that, would, examine, germany, s, capacity, for, reparations, this, meant, that, the, french, government, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, issue, of, reparations, the, treaty, of, versailles, was, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, clemenceau, now, had, to, defend, the, treaty, against, critics, who, viewed, the, compromises, he, had, negotiated, as, inadequate, for, french, national, interests, the, french, parliament, debated, the, treaty, and, louis, barthou, on, 24, september, claimed, that, the, u, s, senate, would, not, vote, for, the, treaty, of, guarantee, or, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, therefore, it, would, have, been, wiser, to, have, the, rhine, as, a, frontier, clemenceau, replied, that, he, was, sure, the, senate, would, ratify, both, and, that, he, had, inserted, article, 429, into, the, treaty, providing, for, new, arrangements, concerning, the, rhine, this, interpretation, of, article, 429, was, disputed, by, barthou, clemenceau, s, main, speech, on, the, treaty, was, delivered, on, 25, september, he, said, that, he, knew, the, treaty, was, not, perfect, but, that, the, war, had, been, fought, by, a, coalition, and, therefore, the, treaty, would, express, the, lowest, common, denominator, of, those, involved, he, claimed, criticisms, of, the, details, of, the, treaty, were, misleading, that, critics, should, look, at, the, treaty, as, a, whole, and, see, how, they, could, benefit, from, it, the, treaty, with, all, its, complex, clauses, will, only, be, worth, what, you, are, worth, it, will, be, what, you, make, it, what, you, are, going, to, vote, to, day, is, not, even, a, beginning, it, is, a, beginning, of, a, beginning, the, ideas, it, contains, will, grow, and, bear, fruit, you, have, won, the, power, to, impose, them, on, a, defeated, germany, we, are, told, that, she, will, revive, all, the, more, reason, not, to, show, her, that, we, fear, her, m, marin, went, to, the, heart, of, the, question, when, he, turned, to, us, and, said, in, despairing, tones, you, have, reduced, us, to, a, policy, of, vigilance, yes, m, marin, do, you, think, that, one, could, make, a, treaty, which, would, do, away, with, the, need, for, vigilance, among, the, nations, of, europe, who, only, yesterday, were, pouring, out, their, blood, in, battle, life, is, a, perpetual, struggle, in, war, as, in, peace, that, struggle, cannot, be, avoided, yes, we, must, have, vigilance, we, must, have, a, great, deal, of, vigilance, i, cannot, say, for, how, many, years, perhaps, i, should, say, for, how, many, centuries, the, crisis, which, has, begun, will, continue, yes, this, treaty, will, bring, us, burdens, troubles, miseries, difficulties, and, that, will, continue, for, long, years, the, chamber, of, deputies, ratified, the, treaty, by, 372, votes, to, 53, with, the, senate, voting, unanimously, for, its, ratification, on, 11, october, clemenceau, gave, his, last, parliamentary, speech, addressed, to, the, senate, he, said, that, any, attempt, to, partition, germany, would, be, self, defeating, and, that, france, must, find, a, way, of, living, with, sixty, million, germans, he, also, said, that, the, bourgeoisie, like, the, aristocracy, before, them, in, the, ancien, r, gime, had, failed, as, a, ruling, class, it, was, now, the, turn, of, the, working, class, to, rule, he, advocated, national, unity, and, a, demographic, revolution, the, treaty, does, not, state, that, france, will, have, many, children, but, it, is, the, first, thing, that, should, have, been, written, there, for, if, france, does, not, have, large, families, it, will, be, in, vain, that, you, put, all, the, finest, clauses, in, the, treaty, that, you, take, away, all, the, germans, guns, france, will, be, lost, because, there, will, be, no, more, french, clemenceau, s, final, tenure, as, prime, minister, witnessed, the, implementation, of, various, reforms, aimed, at, regulating, the, hours, of, labour, a, general, eight, hour, day, law, passed, in, april, 1919, amending, the, french, labour, code, and, in, june, that, year, existing, legislation, concerning, the, duration, of, the, working, day, in, the, mining, industry, was, amended, by, extending, the, eight, hour, day, to, all, classes, of, workers, whether, employed, underground, or, on, the, surface, under, a, previous, law, of, december, 1913, the, eight, hour, limit, had, only, applied, to, workers, employed, underground, in, august, 1919, a, similar, limit, was, introduced, for, all, those, employed, in, french, vessels, another, law, passed, in, 1919, which, came, into, operation, in, october, 1920, prohibited, employment, in, bakeries, between, the, hours, of, 10, p, m, and, 4, a, m, a, decree, of, may, 1919, introduced, the, eight, hour, day, for, workers, on, trams, railways, and, in, inland, waterways, and, a, second, of, june, 1919, extended, this, provision, to, the, state, railways, in, april, 1919, an, enabling, act, was, approved, for, an, eight, hour, day, and, a, six, day, work, week, although, farm, workers, were, excluded, from, the, act, in, 1919, france, adopted, a, new, electoral, system, and, the, legislative, election, gave, the, national, bloc, a, coalition, of, right, wing, parties, a, majority, clemenceau, only, intervened, once, in, the, election, campaign, delivering, a, speech, on, 4, november, at, strasbourg, praising, the, manifesto, and, men, of, the, national, bloc, and, he, urged, that, the, victory, in, the, war, needed, to, be, safeguarded, by, vigilance, in, private, he, was, concerned, at, this, huge, swing, to, the, right, his, friend, georges, mandel, urged, clemenceau, to, stand, for, the, presidency, in, the, upcoming, election, and, on, 15, january, 1920, he, let, mandel, announce, that, he, would, be, prepared, to, serve, if, elected, however, clemenceau, did, not, intend, to, campaign, for, the, post, instead, he, wished, to, be, chosen, by, acclaim, as, a, national, symbol, the, preliminary, meeting, of, the, republican, caucus, a, forerunner, to, the, vote, in, the, national, assembly, chose, paul, deschanel, instead, of, clemenceau, by, a, vote, of, 408, to, 389, in, response, clemenceau, refused, to, be, put, forward, for, the, vote, in, the, national, assembly, because, he, did, not, want, to, win, by, a, small, majority, but, by, a, near, unanimous, vote, only, then, he, claimed, could, he, negotiate, with, confidence, with, the, allies, in, his, last, speech, to, the, cabinet, on, 18, january, he, said, we, must, show, the, world, the, extent, of, our, victory, and, we, must, take, up, the, mentality, and, habits, of, a, victorious, people, which, once, more, takes, its, place, at, the, head, of, europe, but, all, that, will, now, be, placed, in, jeopardy, it, will, take, less, time, and, less, thought, to, destroy, the, edifice, so, patiently, and, painfully, erected, than, it, took, to, complete, it, poor, france, the, mistakes, have, begun, already, clemenceau, resigned, as, prime, minister, as, soon, as, the, presidential, election, was, held, 17, january, 1920, and, took, no, further, part, in, politics, in, private, he, condemned, the, unilateral, occupation, by, french, troops, of, the, german, city, of, frankfurt, in, 1920, and, said, if, he, had, been, in, power, he, would, have, persuaded, the, british, to, join, it, he, took, a, holiday, in, egypt, and, the, sudan, from, february, to, april, 1920, then, embarked, for, the, far, east, in, september, returning, to, france, in, march, 1921, in, june, he, visited, england, and, received, an, honorary, degree, from, the, university, of, oxford, he, met, lloyd, george, and, said, to, him, that, after, the, armistice, he, had, become, the, enemy, of, france, lloyd, george, replied, well, was, not, that, always, our, traditional, policy, he, was, joking, but, after, reflection, clemenceau, took, it, seriously, after, lloyd, george, s, fall, from, power, in, 1922, clemenceau, remarked, as, for, france, it, is, a, real, enemy, who, disappears, lloyd, george, did, not, hide, it, at, my, last, visit, to, london, he, cynically, admitted, it, in, late, 1922, clemenceau, gave, a, lecture, tour, in, the, major, cities, of, the, american, northeast, he, defended, the, policy, of, france, including, war, debts, and, reparations, and, condemned, american, isolationism, he, was, well, received, and, attracted, large, audiences, but, america, s, policy, remained, unchanged, on, 9, august, 1926, he, wrote, an, open, letter, to, the, american, president, calvin, coolidge, that, argued, against, france, paying, all, its, war, debts, france, is, not, for, sale, even, to, her, friends, this, appeal, went, unheard, he, condemned, poincar, s, occupation, of, the, ruhr, in, 1923, as, an, undoing, of, the, entente, between, france, and, britain, he, wrote, two, short, biographies, one, of, the, greek, orator, demosthenes, and, one, of, the, french, painter, claude, monet, he, also, penned, a,
