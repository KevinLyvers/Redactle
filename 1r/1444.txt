the, right, to, self, expression, facilitated, through, autonomous, republics, within, the, russian, state, in, which, they, could, oversee, various, regional, affairs, in, taking, this, view, some, marxists, accused, him, of, bending, too, much, to, bourgeois, nationalism, while, others, accused, him, of, remaining, too, russocentric, stalin, s, native, caucasus, posed, a, particular, problem, because, of, its, highly, multi, ethnic, mix, stalin, opposed, the, idea, of, separate, autonomous, republics, arguing, that, these, would, likely, oppress, ethnic, minorities, within, their, respective, territories, instead, he, called, for, a, transcaucasian, socialist, federative, soviet, republic, the, georgian, communist, party, opposed, the, idea, resulting, in, the, georgian, affair, in, mid, 1921, stalin, returned, to, the, south, caucasus, calling, on, georgian, communists, to, avoid, the, chauvinistic, georgian, nationalism, which, marginalised, the, abkhazian, ossetian, and, adjarian, minorities, in, georgia, on, this, trip, stalin, met, his, son, yakov, and, brought, him, back, to, moscow, nadezhda, had, given, birth, to, another, of, stalin, s, sons, vasily, in, march, 1921, after, the, civil, war, workers, strikes, and, peasant, uprisings, broke, out, across, russia, in, opposition, to, sovnarkom, s, food, requisitioning, project, as, a, result, lenin, introduced, market, oriented, reforms, the, new, economic, policy, nep, there, was, also, internal, turmoil, in, the, communist, party, as, trotsky, led, a, faction, calling, for, abolition, of, trade, unions, lenin, opposed, this, and, stalin, helped, rally, opposition, stalin, also, agreed, to, supervise, the, department, of, agitation, and, propaganda, in, the, central, committee, secretariat, at, the, 11th, party, congress, in, 1922, lenin, nominated, stalin, as, the, party, s, new, general, secretary, although, concerns, were, expressed, that, adopting, this, new, post, would, give, him, too, much, power, stalin, was, appointed, to, the, position, for, lenin, it, was, advantageous, to, have, a, key, ally, in, this, crucial, post, stalin, is, too, crude, and, this, defect, which, is, entirely, acceptable, in, our, milieu, and, in, relationships, among, us, as, communists, becomes, unacceptable, in, the, position, of, general, secretary, i, therefore, propose, to, comrades, that, they, should, devise, a, means, of, removing, him, from, this, job, and, should, appoint, to, this, job, someone, else, who, is, distinguished, from, comrade, stalin, in, all, other, respects, only, by, the, single, superior, aspect, that, he, should, be, more, tolerant, more, polite, and, more, attentive, towards, comrades, less, capricious, etc, lenin, s, testament, 4, january, 1923, this, was, possibly, composed, by, krupskaya, rather, than, lenin, himself, in, may, 1922, a, massive, stroke, left, lenin, partially, paralysed, residing, at, his, gorki, dacha, lenin, s, main, connection, to, sovnarkom, was, through, stalin, lenin, twice, asked, stalin, to, procure, poison, so, that, he, could, commit, suicide, despite, this, comradeship, lenin, disliked, what, he, referred, to, as, stalin, s, asiatic, manner, and, told, his, sister, maria, that, stalin, was, not, intelligent, lenin, and, stalin, argued, on, the, issue, of, foreign, trade, lenin, believed, that, the, soviet, state, should, have, a, monopoly, on, foreign, trade, but, stalin, supported, grigori, sokolnikov, s, view, that, doing, so, was, impractical, another, disagreement, came, over, the, georgian, affair, with, lenin, backing, the, georgian, central, committee, s, desire, for, a, georgian, soviet, republic, over, stalin, s, idea, of, a, transcaucasian, one, they, also, disagreed, on, the, nature, of, the, soviet, state, lenin, called, for, establishment, of, a, new, federation, named, the, union, of, soviet, republics, of, europe, and, asia, stalin, believed, this, would, encourage, independence, sentiment, among, non, russians, instead, arguing, that, ethnic, minorities, would, be, content, as, autonomous, republics, within, the, russian, soviet, federative, socialist, republic, lenin, accused, stalin, of, great, russian, chauvinism, while, stalin, accused, lenin, of, national, liberalism, a, compromise, was, reached, in, which, the, federation, would, be, renamed, the, union, of, soviet, socialist, republics, ussr, the, ussr, s, formation, was, ratified, in, december, 1922, although, officially, a, federal, system, all, major, decisions, were, taken, by, the, governing, politburo, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, in, moscow, their, differences, also, became, personal, lenin, was, particularly, angered, when, stalin, was, rude, to, his, wife, krupskaya, during, a, telephone, conversation, in, the, final, years, of, his, life, krupskaya, provided, governing, figures, with, lenin, s, testament, these, criticised, stalin, s, rude, manners, and, excessive, power, suggesting, that, stalin, should, be, removed, from, the, position, of, general, secretary, some, historians, have, questioned, whether, lenin, ever, produced, these, suggesting, instead, that, they, may, have, been, written, by, krupskaya, stalin, however, never, publicly, voiced, concerns, about, their, authenticity, most, historians, consider, the, document, to, be, an, accurate, reflection, of, lenin, s, views, according, to, stalin, s, secretary, boris, bazhanov, lenin, in, general, leaned, towards, a, collegial, leadership, with, trotsky, in, the, first, position, lenin, died, in, january, 1924, stalin, took, charge, of, the, funeral, and, was, a, pallbearer, the, politburo, embalmed, lenin, s, corpse, and, placed, it, within, a, mausoleum, in, red, square, it, was, incorporated, into, a, growing, personality, cult, devoted, to, lenin, with, petrograd, being, renamed, leningrad, that, year, to, bolster, his, image, as, a, devoted, leninist, stalin, gave, 9, lectures, at, sverdlov, university, on, the, foundations, of, leninism, during, the, 13th, party, congress, in, 1924, lenin, s, testament, was, read, only, to, the, leaders, of, the, provincial, delegations, embarrassed, by, its, contents, stalin, offered, his, resignation, as, general, secretary, this, act, of, humility, saved, him, and, he, was, retained, in, the, position, according, to, boris, bazhanov, stalin, was, jubilant, over, lenin, s, death, while, publicly, putting, on, the, mask, of, grief, as, general, secretary, stalin, had, a, free, hand, in, making, appointments, to, his, own, staff, favouring, new, party, members, from, proletarian, backgrounds, to, the, old, bolsheviks, who, tended, to, be, middle, class, university, graduates, he, ensured, he, had, loyalists, dispersed, across, the, regions, stalin, had, much, contact, with, young, party, functionaries, and, the, desire, for, promotion, led, many, provincial, figures, to, seek, to, impress, stalin, stalin, developed, close, relations, with, the, trio, at, the, heart, of, the, secret, police, felix, dzerzhinsky, genrikh, yagoda, and, vyacheslav, menzhinsky, in, his, private, life, he, divided, his, time, between, his, kremlin, apartment, and, a, dacha, at, zubalova, his, wife, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, svetlana, in, february, 1926, in, the, wake, of, lenin, s, death, a, power, struggle, emerged, to, become, his, successor, alongside, stalin, was, trotsky, zinoviev, kamenev, bukharin, alexei, rykov, and, mikhail, tomsky, stalin, saw, trotsky, whom, he, personally, despised, as, the, main, obstacle, to, his, dominance, while, lenin, had, been, ill, stalin, with, kamenev, and, zinoviev, had, formed, an, unofficial, triumvirate, known, by, its, russian, name, troika, an, alliance, aimed, at, trotsky, although, zinoviev, was, concerned, about, stalin, s, growing, authority, he, rallied, behind, him, at, the, 13th, congress, as, a, counterweight, to, trotsky, who, now, led, a, faction, known, as, the, left, opposition, the, left, opposition, believed, the, nep, conceded, too, much, to, capitalism, stalin, was, called, a, rightist, for, his, support, of, the, policy, stalin, built, up, a, retinue, of, supporters, in, the, central, committee, while, the, left, opposition, were, gradually, removed, from, their, positions, of, influence, he, was, supported, in, this, by, bukharin, who, believed, that, the, left, opposition, s, proposals, would, plunge, the, soviet, union, into, instability, in, late, 1924, stalin, moved, against, kamenev, and, zinoviev, removing, their, supporters, from, key, positions, in, 1925, the, two, moved, into, open, opposition, to, stalin, and, bukharin, at, the, 14th, party, congress, in, december, they, launched, an, unsuccessful, attack, against, stalin, s, faction, stalin, accused, kamenev, and, zinoviev, of, reintroducing, factionalism, and, thus, instability, in, mid, 1926, kamenev, and, zinoviev, joined, with, trotsky, s, supporters, to, form, the, united, opposition, against, stalin, in, october, they, agreed, to, stop, factional, activity, under, threat, of, expulsion, and, later, publicly, recanted, their, views, the, factionalist, arguments, continued, with, stalin, threatening, to, resign, in, october, and, december, 1926, and, again, in, december, 1927, in, october, 1927, zinoviev, and, trotsky, were, removed, from, the, central, committee, the, latter, was, exiled, to, kazakhstan, and, deported, from, the, country, in, 1929, some, united, opposition, members, who, were, repentant, were, later, returned, to, government, stalin, was, now, the, party, s, supreme, leader, although, he, was, not, the, head, of, government, a, task, he, entrusted, to, ally, vyacheslav, molotov, other, important, supporters, on, the, politburo, were, voroshilov, lazar, kaganovich, and, sergo, ordzhonikidze, with, stalin, ensuring, his, allies, ran, state, institutions, at, this, point, stalin, was, the, leader, of, the, oligarchs, but, he, was, far, from, a, dictator, his, growing, influence, was, reflected, in, naming, of, locations, after, him, in, june, 1924, the, ukrainian, mining, town, of, yuzovka, became, stalino, and, in, april, 1925, tsaritsyn, was, renamed, stalingrad, on, the, order, of, mikhail, kalinin, and, avel, enukidze, in, 1926, stalin, published, on, questions, of, leninism, here, he, argued, for, the, concept, of, socialism, in, one, country, which, he, presented, as, an, orthodox, leninist, perspective, it, nevertheless, clashed, with, established, bolshevik, views, that, socialism, could, only, be, achieved, globally, through, the, process, of, world, revolution, we, have, fallen, behind, the, advanced, countries, by, fifty, to, a, hundred, years, we, must, close, that, gap, in, ten, years, either, we, do, this, or, we, ll, be, crushed, this, is, what, our, obligations, before, the, workers, and, peasants, of, the, ussr, dictate, to, us, stalin, february, 1931, the, soviet, union, lagged, behind, the, industrial, development, of, western, countries, and, there, had, been, a, shortfall, of, grain, 1927, produced, only, 70, of, grain, produced, in, 1926, stalin, s, government, feared, attack, from, other, countries, many, communists, including, in, komsomol, ogpu, and, the, red, army, were, eager, to, be, rid, of,

by, the, army, stalin, responded, with, an, article, insisting, that, collectivisation, was, voluntary, and, blaming, violence, on, local, officials, although, he, and, stalin, had, been, close, for,

after, nazi, germany, annexed, austria, and, then, part, of, czechoslovakia, in, 1938, he, recognised, a, war, was, looming, he, sought, to, maintain, soviet, neutrality, hoping, that, a, german, war, against, france, and, britain, would, lead, to, soviet, dominance, in, europe, militarily, the, soviets, also, faced, a, threat, from, the, east, with, soviet, troops, clashing, with, the,

in, its, haste, to, expand, many, of, its, officers, were, poorly, trained, between, 1940, and, 1941, he, also, purged, the, military, leaving, it, with, a, severe, shortage, of, trained, officers,

france, in, mid, 1940, took, stalin, by, surprise, he, increasingly, focused, on, appeasement, with, the, germans, to, delay, any, conflict, with, them, after, the, tripartite, pact, was, signed, by, axis, powers, germany, japan, and, italy, in, october, 1940, stalin, proposed, that, the, ussr, also, join, the, axis, alliance, to, demonstrate, peaceful, intentions, toward, germany, in, april, 1941, the, soviets, signed, a, neutrality, pact, with, japan, although, de, facto, head, of, government, for, a, decade, and, a, half, stalin, concluded, that, relations, with, germany, had,

repercussions, for, soviet, jews, comintern, was, dissolved, in, 1943, and, stalin, encouraged, foreign, marxist, leninist, parties, to, emphasise, nationalism, over, internationalism, to, broaden, their, domestic, appeal, in, april, 1942, stalin, overrode, stavka, by, ordering, the, soviets, first, serious, counter, attack, an, attempt, to, seize, german, held, kharkov, in, eastern, ukraine, this, attack, proved, unsuccessful, that, year, hitler, shifted, his, primary, goal, from, an, overall, victory, on, the, eastern, front, to, the, goal, of, securing, the, oil, fields, in, the, southern, soviet, union, crucial, to, a, long, term, german, war, effort, while, red, army, generals, saw, evidence, that, hitler, would, shift, efforts, south, stalin, considered, this, to, be, a, flanking, move, in, a, renewed, effort, to, take, moscow, in, june, 1942, the, german, army, began, a, major, offensive, in, southern, russia, threatening, stalingrad, stalin, ordered, the, red, army, to, hold, the, city, at, all, costs, this, resulted, in, the, protracted, battle, of, stalingrad, in, december, 1942, he, placed, konstantin, rokossovski, in, charge, of, holding, the, city, in, february, 1943, the, german, troops, attacking, stalingrad, surrendered, the, soviet, victory, there, marked, a, major, turning, point, in, the, war, in, commemoration, stalin, declared, himself, marshal, of, the, soviet, union, by, november, 1942, the, soviets, had, begun, to, repulse, the, important, german, strategic, southern, campaign, and, although, there, were, 2, 5, million, soviet, casualties, in, that, effort, it, permitted, the, soviets, to, take, the, offensive, for, most, of, the, rest, of, the, war, on, the, eastern, front, germany, attempted, an, encirclement, attack, at, kursk, which, was, successfully, repulsed, by, the, soviets, by, the, end, of, 1943, the, soviets, occupied, half, of, the, territory, taken, by, the, germans, from, 1941, to, 1942, soviet, military, industrial, output, also, had, increased, substantially, from, late, 1941, to, early, 1943, after, stalin, had, moved, factories, well, to, the, east, of, the, front, safe, from, german, invasion, and, aerial, assault, in, allied, countries, stalin, was, increasingly, depicted, in, a, positive, light, over, the, course, of, the, war, in, 1941, the, london, philharmonic, orchestra, performed, a, concert, to, celebrate, his, birthday, and, in, 1942, time, magazine, named, him, man, of, the, year, when, stalin, learned, that, people, in, western, countries, affectionately, called, him, uncle, joe, he, was, initially, offended, regarding, it, as, undignified, there, remained, mutual, suspicions, between, stalin, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, and, u, s, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, who, were, together, known, as, the, big, three, churchill, flew, to, moscow, to, visit, stalin, in, august, 1942, and, again, in, october, 1944, stalin, scarcely, left, moscow, throughout, the, war, with, roosevelt, and, churchill, frustrated, with, his, reluctance, to, travel, to, meet, them, in, november, 1943, stalin, met, with, churchill, and, roosevelt, in, tehran, a, location, of, stalin, s, choosing, there, stalin, and, roosevelt, got, on, well, with, both, desiring, the, post, war, dismantling, of, the, british, empire, at, tehran, the, trio, agreed, that, to, prevent, germany, rising, to, military, prowess, yet, again, the, german, state, should, be, broken, up, roosevelt, and, churchill, also, agreed, to, stalin, s, demand, that, the, german, city, of, k, nigsberg, be, declared, soviet, territory, stalin, was, impatient, for, the, uk, and, u, s, to, open, up, a, western, front, to, take, the, pressure, off, of, the, east, they, eventually, did, so, in, mid, 1944, stalin, insisted, that, after, the, war, the, soviet, union, should, incorporate, the, portions, of, poland, it, occupied, pursuant, to, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, with, germany, which, churchill, opposed, discussing, the, fate, of, the, balkans, later, in, 1944, churchill, agreed, to, stalin, s, suggestion, that, after, the, war, bulgaria, romania, hungary, and, yugoslavia, would, come, under, the, soviet, sphere, of, influence, while, greece, would, come, under, that, of, the, west, in, 1944, the, soviet, union, made, significant, advances, across, eastern, europe, toward, germany, including, operation, bagration, a, massive, offensive, in, the, byelorussian, ssr, against, the, german, army, group, centre, in, 1944, the, german, armies, were, pushed, out, of, the, baltic, states, with, the, exception, of, the, ostland, which, were, then, re, annexed, into, the, soviet, union, as, the, red, army, reconquered, the, caucasus, and, crimea, various, ethnic, groups, living, in, the, region, the, kalmyks, chechens, ingushi, karachai, balkars, and, crimean, tatars, were, accused, of, having, collaborated, with, the, germans, using, the, idea, of, collective, responsibility, as, a, basis, stalin, s, government, abolished, their, autonomous, republics, and, between, late, 1943, and, 1944, deported, the, majority, of, their, populations, to, central, asia, and, siberia, over, one, million, people, were, deported, as, a, result, of, the, policy, in, february, 1945, the, three, leaders, met, at, the, yalta, conference, roosevelt, and, churchill, conceded, to, stalin, s, demand, that, germany, pay, the, soviet, union, 20, billion, dollars, in, reparations, and, that, his, country, be, permitted, to, annex, sakhalin, and, the, kuril, islands, in, exchange, for, entering, the, war, against, japan, an, agreement, was, also, made, that, a, post, war, polish, government, should, be, a, coalition, consisting, of, both, communist, and, conservative, elements, privately, stalin, sought, to, ensure, that, poland, would, come, fully, under, soviet, influence, the, red, army, withheld, assistance, to, polish, resistance, fighters, battling, the, germans, in, the, warsaw, uprising, with, stalin, believing, that, any, victorious, polish, militants, could, interfere, with, his, aspirations, to, dominate, poland, through, a, future, marxist, government, although, concealing, his, desires, from, the, other, allied, leaders, stalin, placed, great, emphasis, on, capturing, berlin, first, believing, that, this, would, enable, him, to, bring, more, of, europe, under, long, term, soviet, control, churchill, was, concerned, that, this, was, the, case, and, unsuccessfully, tried, to, convince, the, u, s, that, the, western, allies, should, pursue, the, same, goal, in, april, 1945, the, red, army, seized, berlin, hitler, killed, himself, and, germany, surrendered, in, may, stalin, had, wanted, hitler, captured, alive, he, had, his, remains, brought, to, moscow, to, prevent, them, becoming, a, relic, for, nazi, sympathisers, many, soviet, soldiers, engaged, in, looting, pillaging, and, rape, both, in, germany, and, parts, of, eastern, europe, stalin, refused, to, punish, the, offenders, with, germany, defeated, stalin, switched, focus, to, the, war, with, japan, transferring, half, a, million, troops, to, the, far, east, stalin, was, pressed, by, his, allies, to, enter, the, war, and, wanted, to, cement, the, soviet, union, s, strategic, position, in, asia, on, 8, august, in, between, the, u, s, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, the, soviet, army, invaded, japanese, occupied, manchuria, and, defeated, the, kwantung, army, these, events, led, to, the, japanese, surrender, and, the, war, s, end, soviet, forces, continued, to, expand, until, they, occupied, all, their, territorial, concessions, but, the, u, s, rebuffed, stalin, s, desire, for, the, red, army, to, take, a, role, in, the, allied, occupation, of, japan, at, the, potsdam, conference, in, july, august, 1945, stalin, repeated, previous, promises, that, he, would, refrain, from, a, sovietization, of, eastern, europe, stalin, pushed, for, reparations, from, germany, without, regard, to, the, base, minimum, supply, for, german, citizens, survival, which, worried, harry, truman, and, churchill, who, thought, that, germany, would, become, a, financial, burden, for, western, powers, he, also, pushed, for, war, booty, which, would, permit, the, soviet, union, to, directly, seize, property, from, conquered, nations, without, quantitative, or, qualitative, limitation, and, a, clause, was, added, permitting, this, to, occur, with, some, limitations, germany, was, divided, into, four, zones, soviet, u, s, british, and, french, with, berlin, itself, located, within, the, soviet, area, also, subdivided, thusly, after, the, war, stalin, was, according, to, service, at, the, apex, of, his, career, within, the, soviet, union, he, was, widely, regarded, as, the, embodiment, of, victory, and, patriotism, his, armies, controlled, central, and, eastern, europe, up, to, the, river, elbe, in, june, 1945, stalin, adopted, the, title, of, generalissimo, and, stood, atop, lenin, s, mausoleum, to, watch, a, celebratory, parade, led, by, zhukov, through, red, square, at, a, banquet, held, for, army, commanders, he, described, the, russian, people, as, the, outstanding, nation, and, leading, force, within, the, soviet, union, the, first, time, that, he, had, unequivocally, endorsed, the, russians, over, other, soviet, nationalities, in, 1946, the, state, published, stalin, s, collected, works, in, 1947, it, brought, out, a, second, edition, of, his, official, biography, which, eulogised, him, to, a, greater, extent, than, its, predecessor, he, was, quoted, in, pravda, on, a, daily, basis, and, pictures, of, him, remained, pervasive, on, the, walls, of, workplaces, and, homes, despite, his, strengthened, international, position, stalin, was, cautious, about, internal, dissent, and, desire, for, change, among, the, population, he, was, also, concerned, about, his, returning, armies, who, had, been, exposed, to, a, wide, range, of, consumer, goods, in, germany, much, of, which, they, had, looted, and, brought, back, with, them, in, this, he, recalled, the, 1825, decembrist, revolt, by, russian, soldiers, returning, from, having, defeated, france, in, the, napoleonic, wars, he, ensured, that, returning, soviet, prisoners, of, war, went, through, filtration, camps, as, they, arrived, in, the, soviet, union, in, which, 2, 775, 700, were, interrogated, to, determine, if, they, were, traitors, about, half, were, then, imprisoned, in, labour, camps, in, the, baltic, states, where, there, was, much, opposition, to, soviet, rule, de, kulakisation, and, de, clericalisation, programs, were, initiated, resulting, in, 142, 000, deportations, between, 1945, and, 1949, the, gulag,

millions, more, being, wounded, malnourished, or, orphaned, in, the, war, s, aftermath, some, of, stalin, s, associates, suggested, modifications, to, government, policy, post, war, soviet, society, was, more, tolerant, than, its, pre, war, phase, in, various, respects, stalin, allowed, the, russian, orthodox, church, to, retain, the, churches, it, had, opened, during, the, war, academia, and, the, arts, were, also, allowed, greater, freedom, than, they, had, prior, to, 1941, recognising, the, need, for, drastic, steps, to, be, taken, to, combat, inflation, and, promote, economic, regeneration, in, december, 1947, stalin, s, government, devalued, the, rouble, and, abolished, the, ration, book, system, capital, punishment, was, abolished, in, 1947, but, re, instituted, in, 1950, stalin, s, health, was, deteriorating, and, heart, problems, forced, a, two, month, vacation, in, the, latter, part, of, 1945, he, grew, increasingly, concerned, that, senior, political, and, military, figures, might, try, to, oust, him, he, prevented, any, of, them, from, becoming, powerful, enough, to, rival, him, and, had, their, apartments, bugged, with, listening, devices, he, demoted, molotov, and, increasingly, favoured, beria, and, malenkov, for, key, positions, in, 1949, he, brought, nikita, khrushchev, from, ukraine, to, moscow, appointing, him, a, central, committee, secretary, and, the, head, of, the, city, s, party, branch, in, the, leningrad, affair, the, city, s, leadership, was, purged, amid, accusations, of, treachery, executions, of, many, of, the, accused,

drought, and, ensuing, bad, harvest, in, 1946, it, was, exacerbated, by, government, policy, towards, food, procurement, including, the, state, s, decision, to, build, up, stocks, and, export, food, internationally, rather, than, distributing, it, to, famine, hit, areas, current, estimates, indicate, that, between, one, million, and, 1, 5, million, people, died, from, malnutrition, or, disease, as, a, result, while, agricultural, production, stagnated, stalin, focused, on, a, series, of, major, infrastructure, projects, including, the, construction, of, hydroelectric, plants, canals, and, railway, lines, running, to, the, polar, north, much, of, this, was, constructed, by, prison, labour, in, the, aftermath, of, the, second, world, war, the, british, empire, declined, leaving, the, u, s, and, ussr, as, the, dominant, world, powers, tensions, among, these, former, allies, grew, resulting, in, the, cold, war, although, stalin, publicly, described, the, british, and, u, s, governments, as, aggressive, he, thought, it, unlikely, that, a, war, with, them, would, be, imminent, believing, that, several, decades, of, peace, was, likely, he, nevertheless, secretly, intensified, soviet, research, into, nuclear, weaponry, intent, on, creating, an, atom, bomb, still, stalin, foresaw, the, undesirability, of, a, nuclear, conflict, saying, in, 1949, that, atomic, weapons, can, hardly, be, used, without, spelling, the, end, of, the, world, he, personally, took, a, keen, interest, in, the, development, of, the, weapon, in, august, 1949, the, bomb, was, successfully, tested, in, the, deserts, outside, semipalatinsk, in, kazakhstan, stalin, also, initiated, a, new, military, build, up, the, soviet, army, was, expanded, from, 2, 9, million, soldiers, as, it, stood, in, 1949, to, 5, 8, million, by, 1953, the, u, s, began, pushing, its, interests, on, every, continent, acquiring, air, force, bases, in, africa, and, asia, and, ensuring, pro, u, s, regimes, took, power, across, latin, america, it, launched, the, marshall, plan, in, june, 1947, with, which, it, sought, to, undermine, soviet, hegemony, throughout, eastern, europe, the, u, s, also, offered, financial, assistance, to, countries, as, part, of, the, marshall, plan, on, the, condition, that, they, opened, their, markets, to, trade, aware, that, the, soviets, would, never, agree, the, allies, demanded, that, stalin, withdraw, the, red, army, from, northern, iran, he, initially, refused, leading, to, an, international, crisis, in, 1946, but, one, year, later, stalin, finally, relented, and, moved, the, soviet, troops, out, stalin, also, tried, to, maximise, soviet, influence, on, the, world, stage, unsuccessfully, pushing, for, libya, recently, liberated, from, italian, occupation, to, become, a, soviet, protectorate, he, sent, molotov, as, his, representative, to, san, francisco, to, take, part, in, negotiations, to, form, the, united, nations, insisting, that, the,

capitalist, countries, within, western, countries, stalin, was, increasingly, portrayed, as, the, most, evil, dictator, alive, and, compared, to, hitler, according, to, his, daughter, svetlana, alliluyeva, she, remembered, her, father, saying, after, together, with, the, germans, we, would, have, been, invincible, in, 1948, stalin, edited, and, rewrote, sections, of, falsifiers, of, history, published, as, a, series, of, pravda, articles, in, february, 1948, and, then, in, book, form, written, in, response, to, public, revelations, of, the, 1939, soviet, alliance, with, germany, it, focused, on, blaming, the, western, powers, for, the, war, he, also, erroneously, claimed, that, the, initial, german, advance, in, the, early, part, of, the, war, during, operation, barbarossa, was, not, a, result, of, soviet, military, weakness, but, rather, a, deliberate, soviet, strategic, retreat, in, 1949, celebrations, took, place, to, mark, stalin, s, seventieth, birthday, although, he, was, 71, at, the, time, at, which, stalin, attended, an, event, in, the, bolshoi, theatre, alongside, marxist, leninist, leaders, from, across, europe, and, asia, after, the, war, stalin, sought, to, retain, soviet, dominance, across, eastern, europe, while, expanding, its, influence, in, asia, cautiously, regarding, the, responses, from, the, western, allies, stalin, avoided, immediately, installing, communist, party, governments, across, eastern, europe, instead, initially, ensuring, that, marxist, leninists, were, placed, in, coalition, ministries, in, contrast, to, his, approach, to, the, baltic, states, he, rejected, the, proposal, of, merging, the, new, communist, states, into, the, soviet, union, rather, recognising, them, as, independent, nation, states, he, was, faced, with, the, problem, that, there, were, few, marxists, left, in, eastern, europe, with, most, having, been, killed, by, the, nazis, he, demanded, that, war, reparations, be, paid, by, germany, and, its, axis, allies, hungary, romania, and, the, slovak, republic, aware, that, these, countries, had, been, pushed, toward, socialism, through, invasion, rather, than, by, proletarian, revolution, stalin, referred, to, them, not, as, dictatorships, of, the, proletariat, but, as, people, s, democracies, suggesting, that, in, these, countries, there, was, a, pro, socialist, alliance, combining, the, proletariat, peasantry, and, lower, middle, class, churchill, observed, that, an, iron, curtain, had, been, drawn, across, europe, separating, the, east, from, the, west, in, september, 1947, a,

he, offered, advice, on, their, ideas, for, instance, he, cautioned, against, the, yugoslav, idea, for, a, balkan, federation, incorporating, bulgaria, and, albania, stalin, had, a, particularly, strained, relationship, with, yugoslav, leader, josip, broz, tito, due, to, the, latter, s, continued, calls, for, a, balkan, federation, and, for, soviet, aid, for, the, communist, forces, in, the, ongoing, greek, civil, war, in, march, 1948, stalin, launched, an, anti, tito, campaign, accusing, the, yugoslav, communists, of, adventurism, and, deviating, from, marxist, leninist, doctrine, at, the, second, cominform, conference, held, in, bucharest, in, june, 1948, east, european, communist, leaders, all, denounced, tito, s, government, accusing, them, of, being, fascists, and, agents, of, western, capitalism, stalin, ordered, several, assassination, attempts, on, tito, s, life, and, even, contemplated, an, invasion, of, yugoslavia, itself, stalin, suggested, that, a, unified, but, demilitarised, german, state, be, established, hoping, that, it, would, either, come, under, soviet, influence, or, remain, neutral, when, the, u, s, and, uk, remained, opposed, to, this, stalin, sought, to, force, their, hand, by, blockading, berlin, in, june, 1948, he, gambled, that, the, western, powers, would, not, risk, war, but, they, airlifted, supplies, into, west, berlin, until, may, 1949, when, stalin, relented, and, ended, the, blockade, in, september, 1949, the, western, powers, transformed, western, germany, into, an, independent, federal, republic, of, germany, in, response,

independent, state, with, free, democratic, elections, in, poland, the, soviets, merged, various, socialist, parties, into, the, polish, united, workers, party, pzpr, and, vote, rigging, was, used, to, ensure, that, the, pzpr, secured, office, the, 1947, hungarian, elections, were, also, rigged, by, stalin, with, the, hungarian, working, people, s, party, taking, control, in, czechoslovakia,

the, world, s, land, mass, privately, stalin, revealed, that, he, had, underestimated, the, chinese, communists, and, their, ability, to, win, the, civil, war, instead, encouraging, them, to, make, another, peace, with, the, kmt, in, december, 1949, mao, visited, stalin, initially, stalin, refused, to, repeal, the, sino, soviet, treaty, of, 1945, which, significantly, benefited, the, soviet, union, over, china, although, in, january, 1950, he, relented, and, agreed, to, sign, a, new, treaty, between, the, two, countries, stalin, was, concerned, that, mao, might, follow, tito, s, example, by, pursuing, a, course, independent, of, soviet, influence, and, made, it, known, that, if, displeased, he, would, withdraw, assistance, from, china, the, chinese, desperately, needed, said,

agreed, by, may, 1950, the, north, korean, army, launched, the, korean, war, by, invading, south, korea, in, june, 1950, making, swift, gains, and, capturing, seoul, both, stalin, and, mao, believed, that, a, swift, victory, would, ensue, the, u, s, went, to, the, un, security, council, which, the, soviets, were, boycotting, over, its, refusal, to, recognise, mao, s, government, and, secured,

obtaining, an, ally, in, the, middle, east, when, the, israeli, ambassador, golda, meir, arrived, in, the, ussr, stalin, was, angered, by, the, jewish, crowds, who, gathered, to, greet, her, he, was, further, angered, by, israel, s, growing, alliance, with, the, u, s, after, stalin, fell, out, with, israel, he, launched, an, anti, jewish, campaign, within, the, soviet, union, and, the, eastern,

and, rootless, cosmopolitanism, with, growing, levels, of, anti, semitism, being, expressed, across, soviet, society, stalin, s, increasing, tolerance, of, anti, semitism, may, have, stemmed, from, his, increasing, russian, nationalism, or, from, the, recognition, that, anti, semitism, had, proved, a, useful, mobilising, tool, for, hitler, and, that, he, could, do, the, same, he, may, have,

life, according, to, kotkin, stalin, held, zealous, marxist, convictions, while, montefiore, suggested, that, marxism, held, a, quasi, religious, value, for, stalin, although, he, never, became, a, georgian, nationalist, during, his, early, life, elements, from, georgian, nationalist, thought, blended, with, marxism, in, his, outlook, stalin, believed, in, the, need, to, adapt, marxism, to, changing, circumstances, in, 1917, he, declared, that, there, is, dogmatic, marxism, and, there, is, creative, marxism, i, stand, on, the, ground, of, the, latter, volkogonov, believed, that, stalin, s, marxism, was, shaped, by, his, dogmatic, turn, of, mind, suggesting, that, this, had, been, instilled, in, the, soviet, leader, during, his, education, in, religious, institutions, according, to, scholar, robert, service, stalin, s, few, innovations, in, ideology, were, crude, dubious, developments, of, marxism, as, a, marxist, and, an, anti, capitalist, stalin, believed, in, an, inevitable, class, war, between, the, world, s, proletariat, and, bourgeoisie, he, believed, that, the, working, classes, would, prove, successful, in, this, struggle, and, would, establish, a, dictatorship, of, the, proletariat, regarding, the, soviet, union, as, an, example, of, such, a, state, he, also, believed, that, this, proletarian, state, would, need, to, introduce, repressive, measures, against, foreign, and, domestic, enemies, to, ensure, the, full, crushing, of, the, propertied, classes, and, thus, the, class, war, would, intensify, with, the, advance, of, socialism, as, a, propaganda, tool, the, shaming, of, enemies, explained, all, inadequate, economic, and, political, outcomes, the, hardships, endured, by, the, populace, and, military, failures, stalin, adhered, to, the, leninist, variant, of, marxism, in, his, book, foundations, of, leninism, he, stated, that, leninism, is, the, marxism, of, the, epoch, of, imperialism, and, of, the, proletarian, revolution, he, claimed, to, be, a, loyal, leninist, although, was, according, to, service, not, a, blindly, obedient, leninist, stalin, respected, lenin, but, not, uncritically, and, spoke, out, when, he, believed, that, lenin, was, wrong, during, the, period, of, his, revolutionary, activity, stalin, regarded, some, of, lenin, s, views, and, actions, as, being, the, self, indulgent, activities, of, a, spoiled, migr, deeming, them, counterproductive, for, those, bolshevik, activists, based, within, the, russian, empire, itself, after, the, october, revolution, they, continued, to, have, differences, khlevniuk, nevertheless, believed, that, the, pair, developed, a, strong, bond, over, the, years, while, kotkin, suggested, that, stalin, s, friendship, with, lenin, was, the, single, most, important, relationship, in, stalin, s, life, after, lenin, s, death, stalin, relied, heavily, on, lenin, s, writings, far, more, so, than, those, of, marx, and, engels, to, guide, him, in, the, affairs, of, state, stalin, adopted, the, leninist, view, on, the, need, for, a, revolutionary, vanguard, who, could, lead, the, proletariat, rather, than, being, led, by, them, stalin, viewed, nations, as, contingent, entities, which, were, formed, by, capitalism, and, could, merge, into, others, ultimately, he, believed, that, all, nations, would, merge, into, a, single, global, community, and, regarded, all, nations, as, inherently, equal, in, his, work, he, stated, that, the, right, of, secession, should, be, offered, to, the, ethnic, minorities, of, the, russian, empire, but, that, they, should, not, be, encouraged, to, take, that, option, he, was, of, the, view, that, if, they, became, fully, autonomous, then, they, would, end, up, being, controlled, by, the, most, reactionary, elements, of, their, community, stalin, s, push, for, soviet, westward, expansion, into, eastern, europe, resulted, in, accusations, of, russian, imperialism, ethnically, georgian, stalin, grew, up, speaking, georgian, it, has, been, argued, his, ancestry, was, genetically, ossetian, but, he, never, acknowledged, an, ossetian, identity, he, remained, proud, of, his, georgian, identity, and, throughout, his, life, retained, a, heavy, georgian, accent, when, speaking, russian, some, colleagues, described, him, as, asiatic, and, he, supposedly, said, that, i, am, not, a, european, man, but, an, asian, a, russified, georgian, service, noted, that, stalin, would, never, be, russian, and, never, tried, to, pretend, he, was, montefiore, was, of, the, view, that, after, 1917, became, quadri, national, georgian, by, nationality, russian, by, loyalty, internationalist, by, ideology, soviet, by, citizenship, described, as, a, poor, orator, stalin, s, style, was, simple, and, clear, without, flights, of, fancy, catchy, phrases, or, platform, histrionics, he, rarely, spoke, before, large, audiences, and, preferred, to, express, himself, in, writing, stalin, s, mustached, face, was, pock, marked, from, smallpox, during, childhood, this, was, airbrushed, from, published, photographs, he, was, born, with, a, webbed, left, foot, and, his, left, arm, had, been, injured, in, childhood,

with, simple, and, inexpensive, clothing, and, furniture, as, leader, of, the, soviet, union, stalin, typically, awoke, around, 11, am, with, lunch, being, served, between, 3, 5, pm, and, dinner, no, earlier, than, 9, pm, he, then, worked, late, he, often, dined, with, other, politburo, members, and, their, families, as, leader, he, rarely, left, moscow, unless, to, go, to, a, dacha, for, holiday, he, disliked, travel, and, refused, to, by, plane, his, choice, of, favoured, holiday, house, changed, although, he, holidayed, in, south, ussr, every, year, from, 1925, to, 1936, and, 1945, to, 1951, he, had, a, dacha, at, zubalova, 35, km, outside, moscow, although, ceased, using, it, after, nadezhda, s, 1932, suicide, after, 1932, he, favoured, holidays, in, abkhazia, being, a, friend, of, its, leader, nestor, lakoba, in, 1934, his, new, kuntsevo, dacha, was, built, 9, km, from, the, kremlin, it, became, his, primary, residence, in, 1935, he, began, using, a, new, dacha, provided, by, lakoba, at, novy, afon, in, 1936, he, had, the, kholodnaya, rechka, dacha, built, on, the, abkhazian, coast, designed, by, miron, merzhanov, stalin, was, regarded, as, an, exceptional, individual, from, childhood, according, to, both, hostile, and, friendly, accounts, he, possessed, a, complex, mind, remarkable, self, control, and, excellent, memory, stalin, was, a, diligent, worker, with, a, keen, interest, in, learning, as, a, leader, he, meticulously, scrutinized, details, from, film, scripts, to, military, plans, his, private, and, working, lives, were, intertwined, despite, his, limited, formal, education, stalin, s, intellectual, capacity, was, considerable, though, was, sometimes, susceptible, to, charlatans, like, trofim, lysenko, stalin, s, personality, was, multifaceted, allowing, him, to, play, different, roles, depending, on, the, audience, and, he, was, skilled, in, deception, his, appointment, as, general, secretary, is, attributed, to, his, manipulation, of, lenin, s, fears, of, a, party, split, historians, have, noted, lazar, kaganovich, s, description, of, several, stalins, to, understand, his, complex, character, stalin, was, an, effective, organizer, with, a, strategic, mind, and, judged, others, by, their, inner, strength, and, cleverness, although, he, could, be, rude, stalin, rarely, raised, his, voice, however, as, his, health, deteriorated, he, became, unpredictable, and, bad, tempered, he, could, be, charming, and, enjoyed, cracking, jokes, when, relaxed, stalin, lacked, compassion, possibly, exacerbated, by, imprisonment, and, exile, though, he, occasionally, showed, kindness, to, strangers, even, during, the, great, terror, he, could, be, self, righteous, resentful, and, vindictive, often, holding, grudges, for, years, by, the, 1920s, he, had, become, suspicious, and, conspiratorial, prone, to, believing, in, plots, against, him, and, international, conspiracies, while, he, never, attended, torture, sessions, or, executions, stalin, took, pleasure, in, degrading, and, humiliating, people, and, kept, even, close, associates, in, a, state, of, unrelieved, fear, stalin, s, brutality, marked, him, as, a, natural, extremist, and, service, suggested, he, had, tendencies, toward, a, paranoid, and, sociopathic, personality, disorder, however, geoffrey, roberts, argued, stalin, was, not, a, psychopath, but, an, emotionally, intelligent, and, feeling, intellectual, other, historians, linked, his, brutality, to, his, commitment, to, the, survival, of, the, soviet, union, and, marxist, leninist, ideology, in, contrast, e, a, rees, believed, it, was, psychopathy, that, bred, stalin, s, tyranny, citing, a, 1927, diagnosis, by, neuropathologist, vladimir, bekhterev, that, described, him, as, a, typical, case, of, severe, paranoia, stalin, had, a, keen, interest, in, the, arts, he, protected, certain, soviet, writers, such, as, mikhail, bulgakov, even, when, their, work, was, criticized, as, harmful, to, his, regime, stalin, enjoyed, classical, music, owned, around, 2, 700, records, and, often, attended, the, bolshoi, theatre, in, the, 1930s, and, 40s, his, taste, was, conservative, favoring, classical, drama, opera, and, ballet, over, what, he, dismissed, as, experimental, formalism, and, disliked, avant, garde, in, the, visual, arts, too, he, was, a, voracious, reader, with, over, 20, 000, books, with, little, fiction, his, favorite, subject, was, history, followed, by, marxist, theory, and, fiction, stalin, was, considered, an, effective, debater, who, often, quoted, marx, and, engels, he, kept, up, with, debates, in, historical, studies, particularly, those, related, to, russian, mesopotamian, ancient, roman, and, byzantine, history, he, was, especially, interested, in, the, reigns, of, ivan, the, terrible, peter, the, great, and, catherine, the, great, an, autodidact, stalin, claimed, to, read, as, many, as, 500, pages, a, day, lenin, was, his, favorite, author, but, he, read, and, appreciated, works, by, trotsky, and, other, adversaries, stalin, enjoyed, watching, films, particularly, at, night, in, cinemas, installed, in, the, kremlin, and, his, dachas, he, liked, westerns, though, his, favorite, films, were, volga, volga, and, circus, stalin, was, an, accomplished, billiards, player, and, collected, watches, he, enjoyed, practical, jokes, such, as, placing, a, tomato, on, the, chairs, of, politburo, members, at, social, events, stalin, encouraged, singing, and, drinking, hoping, others, would, drunkenly, reveal, secrets, to, him, stalin, had, a, love, of, flowers, from, infancy, and, became, a, keen, gardener, his, volynskoe, suburb, had, a, 20, hectare, 50, acre, park, to, which, stalin, devoted, much, attention, stalin, s, rise, to, absolute, power, has, been, the, subject, of, much, debate, some, historians, attribute, his, success, to, personal, qualities, while, others, emphasize, the, growth, of, soviet, bureaucracy, which, trotsky, argued, served, as, a, power, base, for, stalin, the, premature, deaths, of, lenin, and, yakov, sverdlov, are, seen, as, key, factors, in, stalin, s, rise, peter, kenez, believed, trotsky, could, have, removed, stalin, with, lenin, s, testament, but, acquiesced, to, the, collective, decision, not, to, publish, it, friendship, was, important, to, stalin, and, he, used, it, to, gain, and, maintain, power, kotkin, observed, that, stalin, generally, gravitated, to, people, like, himself, parvenu, intelligentsia, of, humble, background, stalin, s, friendships, meandered, between, love, admiration, and, venomous, jealousy, according, to, boris, bazhanov, stalin, s, one, time, secretary, women, didn, t, interest, him, his, own, woman, was, enough, for, him, and, he, paid, scant, attention, to, her, however, montefiore, noted, that, in, his, early, life, stalin, rarely, seems, to, have, been, without, a, girlfriend, montefiore, described, stalin, s, favoured, types, as, young, malleable, teenagers, or, buxom, peasant, women, who, would, be, supportive, and, unchallenging, stalin, regarded, women, as, a, resource, for, sexual, gratification, and, domestic, comfort, stalin, married, his, first, wife, ekaterina, svanidze, in, 1906, according, to, montefiore, theirs, was, a, true, love, match, volkogonov, suggested, that, she, was, probably, the, one, human, being, he, had, really, loved, when, she, died, stalin, allegedly, said, this, creature, softened, my, heart, of, stone, however, russian, historian, anton, antonov, ovseenko, wrote, that, stalin, was, physically, abusive, to, her, they, had, a, son, yakov, who, often, frustrated, and, annoyed, stalin, yakov, had, a, daughter, galina, before, fighting, for, the, red, army, in, the, second, world, war, he, was, captured, by, the, german, army, and, committed, suicide, in, 1914, stalin, aged, 35, had, a, relationship, with, lidia, pereprygina, then, 14, who, became, pregnant, with, stalin, s, child, in, december, 1914, pereprygia, gave, birth, to, their, child, although, the, infant, died, soon, after, in, 1916, pereprygina, was, pregnant, again, she, allegedly, gave, birth, to, their, son, named, alexander, davydov, in, around, april, 1917, stalin, later, came, to, know, of, the, child, s, existence, but, showed, no, interest, in, him, stalin, s, second, wife, was, nadezhda, alliluyeva, theirs, was, not, an, easy, relationship, they, often, fought, they, had, two, biological, children, a, son, vasily, and, daughter, svetlana, and, adopted, another, son, artyom, sergeev, in, 1921, it, is, unclear, if, stalin, ever, had, a, mistress, during, or, after, this, marriage, she, suspected, he, was, unfaithful, and, committed, suicide, in, 1932, stalin, regarded, vasily, as, spoiled, and, often, chastised, his, behaviour, as, stalin, s, son, vasily, was, swiftly, promoted, through, the, red, army, and, allowed, a, lavish, lifestyle, conversely, stalin, had, an, affectionate, relationship, with, svetlana, during, her, childhood, and, was, very, fond, of, artyom, he, disapproved, of, svetlana, s, suitors, and, husbands, putting, a, strain, on, their, relationship, after, the, second, world, war, he, made, little, time, for, his, children, and, his, family, played, a, decreasingly, important, role, in, his, life, after, stalin, s, death, svetlana, changed, her, surname, to, alliluyeva, and, defected, to, the, u, s, after, nadezhda, s, death, stalin, became, increasingly, close, to, his, sister, in, law, zhenya, alliluyeva, montefiore, believed, they, were, lovers, there, are, unproven, rumours, that, from, 1934, onward, he, had, a, relationship, with, his, housekeeper, valentina, istomina, montefiore, claimed, stalin, had, at, least, two, illegitimate, children, although, he, never, recognised, them, as, being, his, one, konstantin, kuzakov, taught, philosophy, at, the, leningrad, military, mechanical, institute, but, never, met, stalin, the, other, alexander, was, the, son, of, lidia, pereprygina, he, was, raised, as, the, son, of, a, peasant, fisherman, and, the, soviet, authorities, made, him, swear, never, to, reveal, stalin, was, his, biological, father, stalin, was, complicit, with, the, persecution, of, relatives, of, his, former, wives, such, as, maria, and, alexander, svanidze, who, were, arrested, and, eliminated, during, the, great, purge, the, historian, robert, conquest, stated, that, stalin, perhaps, determined, the, course, of, the, twentieth, century, more, than, any, other, individual, biographers, like, service, and, volkogonov, have, considered, him, an, outstanding, and, exceptional, politician, montefiore, labelled, stalin, as, that, rare, combination, both, intellectual, and, killer, a, man, who, was, the, ultimate, politician, and, the, most, elusive, and, fascinating, of, the, twentieth, century, titans, according, to, historian, kevin, mcdermott, interpretations, of, stalin, range, from, the, sycophantic, and, adulatory, to, the, vitriolic, and, condemnatory, for, most, westerners, and, anti, communist, russians, he, is, viewed, overwhelmingly, negatively, as, a, mass, murderer, for, significant, numbers, of, russians, and, georgians, he, is, regarded, as, a, great, statesman, and, state, builder, according, to, service, stalin, strengthened, and, stabilised, the, soviet, union, in, under, three, decades, stalin, transformed, the, soviet, union, into, a, major, industrial, world, power, one, which, could, claim, impressive, achievements, in, terms, of, urbanisation, military, strength, education, and, soviet, pride, under, his, rule, the, average, soviet, life, expectancy, grew, due, to, improved, living, conditions, nutrition, and, medical, care, as, mortality, rates, also, declined, although, millions, of, soviet, citizens, despised, him, support, for, stalin, was, nevertheless, widespread, throughout, soviet, society, conversely, the, historian, vadim, rogovin, argued, that, the, great, terror, which, had, gained, traction, in, 1937, caused, losses, to, the, communist, movement, both, in, the, ussr, and, throughout, the, world, from, which, the, movement, has, not, recovered, to, this, very, day, similarly, khrushchev, believed, his, widespread, purges, of, the, most, advanced, nucleus, of, people, among, the, old, bolsheviks, and, leading, figures, in, the, military, and, scientific, fields, had, undoubtedly, weakened, the, nation, stalin, s, necessity, for, the, soviet, union, s, economic, development, has, been, questioned, and, it, has, been, argued, that, stalin, s, policies, from, 1928, onwards, may, have, only, been, a, limiting, factor, stalin, s, soviet, union, has, been, characterised, as, a, totalitarian, state, with, stalin, its, authoritarian, leader, various, biographers, have, described, him, as, a, dictator, an, autocrat, or, accused, him, of, practising, caesarism, montefiore, argued, that, while, stalin, initially, ruled, as, part, of, a, communist, party, oligarchy, the, soviet, government, transformed, from, this, oligarchy, into, a, personal, dictatorship, in, 1934, with, stalin, only, becoming, absolute, dictator, between, march, and, june, 1937, when, senior, military, and, nkvd, figures, were, eliminated, according, to, kotkin, stalin, built, a, personal, dictatorship, within, the, bolshevik, dictatorship, in, both, the, soviet, union, and, elsewhere, he, came, to, be, portrayed, as, an, oriental, despot, dmitri, volkogonov, characterised, him, as, one, of, the, most, powerful, figures, in, human, history, mcdermott, nevertheless, cautioned, against, over, simplistic, stereotypes, promoted, in, the, fiction, of, writers, like, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, vasily, grossman, and, anatoly, rybakov, that, portrayed, stalin, as, an, omnipotent, and, omnipresent, tyrant, who, controlled, every, aspect, of, soviet, life, service, similarly, warned, of, the, portrayal, of, stalin, as, an, unimpeded, despot, noting, that, powerful, though, he, was, his, powers, were, not, limitless, and, his, rule, depended, on, his, willingness, to, conserve, the, soviet, structure, he, had, inherited, kotkin, observed, that, stalin, s, ability, to, remain, in, power, relied, on, him, having, a, majority, in, the, politburo, at, all, times, khlevniuk, noted, that, at, various, points, particularly, when, stalin, was, old, and, frail, there, were, periodic, manifestations, in, which, the, party, oligarchy, threatened, his, autocratic, control, stalin, denied, to, foreign, visitors, that, he, was, a, dictator, stating, that, those, who, labelled, him, such, did, not, understand, the, soviet, governance, structure, a, vast, literature, devoted, to, stalin, has, been, produced, during, stalin, s, lifetime, his, approved, biographies, were, largely, hagiographic, in, content, stalin, ensured, that, these, works, gave, very, little, attention, to, his, early, life, particularly, because, he, did, not, wish, to, emphasise, his, georgian, origins, in, a, state, numerically, dominated, by, russians, since, his, death, many, more, biographies, have, been, written, although, until, the, 1980s, these, relied, largely, on, the, same, sources, of, information, under, mikhail, gorbachev, s, soviet, administration, various, previously, classified, files, on, stalin, s, life, were, made, available, to, historians, at, which, point, stalin, became, one, of, the, most, urgent, and, vital, issues, on, the, public, agenda, in, the, soviet, union, after, the, dissolution, of, the, union, in, 1991, the, rest, of, the, archives, were, opened, to, historians, resulting, in, much, new, information, about, stalin, coming, to, light, and, producing, a, flood, of, new, research, leninists, remain, divided, in, their, views, on, stalin, some, view, him, as, lenin, s, authentic, successor, while, others, believe, he, betrayed, lenin, s, ideas, by, deviating, from, them, the, socio, economic, nature, of, stalin, s, soviet, union, has, also, been, much, debated, varyingly, being, labelled, a, form, of, state, socialism, state, capitalism, bureaucratic, collectivism, or, a, totally, unique, mode, of, production, socialist, writers, like, volkogonov, have, acknowledged, that, stalin, s, actions, damaged, the, enormous, appeal, of, socialism, generated, by, the, october, revolution, with, a, high, number, of, excess, deaths, occurring, under, his, rule, stalin, has, been, labelled, one, of, the, most, notorious, figures, in, history, as, the, majority, of, excess, deaths, under, stalin, were, not, direct, killings, the, exact, number, of, victims, of, stalinism, is, difficult, to, calculate, due, to, lack, of, consensus, among, scholars, on, which, deaths, can, be, attributed, to, the, regime, stalin, has, also, been, accused, of, genocide, in, the, cases, of, forced, population, transfer, of, ethnic, minorities, in, the, soviet, union, and, the, famine, in, ukraine, under, stalin, the, death, penalty, was, extended, to, adolescents, as, young, as, 12, in, 1935, official, records, reveal, 799, 455, documented, executions, in, the, soviet, union, between, 1921, and, 1953, 681, 692, of, these, were, carried, out, between, 1937, and, 1938, according, to, historian, michael, ellman, the, number, of, deaths, during, the, purge, is, 950, 000, to, 1, 2, million, archival, data, shows, that, 1, 053, 829, perished, in, the, gulag, system, from, 1934, to, 1953, though, current, historical, consensus, is, that, between, 1, 5, and, 1, 7, million, died, as, a, result, of, their, incarceration, about, 6, 3, million, people, were, affected, by, mass, deportations, between, 1930, and, 1952, of, which, an, estimated, 1, to, 1, 5, million, died, historian, stephen, g, wheatcroft, and, ellman, attribute, roughly, 3, to, 3, 5, million, deaths, to, stalin, s, regime, r, w, davies, estimate, famine, deaths, at, 5, 5, 6, 5, million, while, scholar, steven, rosefielde, gives, a, number, of, 8, 7, million, in, 2011, historian, timothy, d, snyder, summarised, that, stalin, s, regime, was, responsible, for, 9, million, deaths, with, 6, million, of, these, being, deliberate, killings, according, to, rogovin, 80, 90, of, the, members, of, the, central, committee, were, annihilated, shortly, after, his, death, the, soviet, union, went, through, a, period, of, de, stalinization, malenkov, denounced, the, stalin, personality, cult, which, was, subsequently, criticised, in, pravda, in, 1956, khrushchev, gave, his, secret, speech, titled, on, the, cult, of, personality, and, its, consequences, to, a, closed, session, of, the, party, s, 20th, congress, there, khrushchev, denounced, stalin, for, both, his, mass, repression, and, his, personality, cult, he, repeated, these, denunciations, at, the, 22nd, party, congress, in, october, 1962, in, october, 1961, stalin, s, body, was, removed, from, the, mausoleum, and, buried, in, the, kremlin, wall, necropolis, the, location, marked, by, a, bust, stalingrad, was, renamed, volgograd, khrushchev, s, de, stalinisation, process, ended, when, he, was, replaced, as, leader, by, leonid, brezhnev, in, 1964, the, latter, introduced, a, level, of, re, stalinisation, within, the, soviet, union, in, 1969, and, again, in, 1979, plans, were, proposed, for, a, full, rehabilitation, of, stalin, s, legacy, but, on, both, occasions, were, halted, due, to, fears, of, damaging, the, ussr, s, public, image, mikhail, gorbachev, saw, the, total, denunciation, of, stalin, as, necessary, for, the, regeneration, of, soviet, society, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, in, 1991, boris, yeltsin, continued, gorbachev, s, denunciation, of, stalin, but, added, to, it, a, denunciation, of, lenin, his, successor, vladimir, putin, did, not, seek, to, rehabilitate, stalin, but, emphasised, the, celebration, of, soviet, achievements, under, stalin, s, leadership, rather, than, the, stalinist, repressions, in, october, 2017, putin, opened, the, wall, of, grief, memorial, in, moscow, noting, that, the, terrible, past, would, neither, be, justified, by, anything, nor, erased, from, the, national, memory, in, a, 2017, interview, putin, added, that, while, we, should, not, forget, the, horrors, of, stalinism, the, excessive, demonisation, of, stalin, is, a, means, to, attack, soviet, union, and, russia, in, recent, years, the, government, and, general, public, of, russia, has, been, accused, of, rehabilitating, stalin, in, a, 2021, poll, 70, of, russians, indicated, they, had, a, mostly, very, favourable, view, of, stalin
