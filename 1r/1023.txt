kanishka, i, 1, also, known, as, kanishka, the, great, was, an, emperor, of, the, kushan, dynasty, under, whose, reign, c, 127, 150, ce, the, empire, reached, its, zenith, he, is, famous, for, his, military, political, and, spiritual, achievements, a, descendant, of, kujula, kadphises, founder, of, the, kushan, empire, kanishka, came, to, rule, an, empire, extending, from, central, asia, and, gandhara, to, pataliputra, on, the, gangetic, plain, the, main, capital, of, his, empire, was, located, at, puru, apura, peshawar, in, gandhara, with, another, major, capital, at, mathura, coins, of, kanishka, were, found, in, tripuri, present, day, jabalpur, although, he, never, converted, to, the, religion, his, conquests, and, patronage, of, buddhism, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, silk, road, and, in, the, transmission, of, mahayana, buddhism, from, gandhara, across, the, karakoram, range, to, china, around, 127, ce, he, replaced, greek, with, bactrian, as, the, official, language, of, administration, in, the, empire, earlier, scholars, believed, that, kanishka, ascended, the, kushan, throne, in, 78, ce, and, that, this, date, was, used, as, the, beginning, of, the, saka, calendar, era, however, historians, no, longer, regard, this, date, as, that, of, kanishka, s, accession, falk, estimates, that, kanishka, came, to, the, throne, in, 127, ce, there, are, two, theories, about, kanisha, s, origins, both, based, on, the, supposition, of, a, separate, kanishka, dynasty, the, earlier, sten, konow, s, is, that, kanishka, came, from, khotan, having, been, summoned, as, an, ethnic, ally, at, the, time, of, troubles, after, vima, s, reign, konow, supports, this, theory, by, citing, a, tibetan, tradition, that, a, khotanese, expedition, to, india, of, about, a, d, 120, was, commanded, by, a, king, vijayakirti, along, with, a, king, kanika, and, the, king, of, guzan, roman, ghirshman, s, similar, theory, is, that, kanishka, was, originally, king, of, kashmir, before, becoming, suzerain, of, the, dynasty, as, a, whole, he, cites, the, above, mentioned, khalatse, epigraph, which, may, allude, to, kushan, power, reaching, the, northeast, corner, of, kashmir, and, also, the, rajatarangini, in, which, the, list, of, turushka, kings, of, kashmir, gave, kanishka, s, name, as, the, third, of, a, sequence, along, with, the, names, of, hushka, and, jushka, finally, testimony, of, kanishka, s, activity, in, kashmir, in, favor, of, the, buddhist, faith, suggests, that, he, favored, the, region, above, others, and, that, he, founded, peshawar, as, his, capital, to, be, close, to, kashmir, he, was, of, yuezhi, ethnicity, and, his, native, language, was, probably, tocharian, kanishka, was, the, successor, of, vima, kadphises, as, demonstrated, by, an, impressive, genealogy, of, the, kushan, kings, known, as, the, rabatak, inscription, the, connection, of, kanishka, with, other, kushan, rulers, is, described, in, the, rabatak, inscription, as, kanishka, makes, the, list, of, the, kings, who, ruled, up, to, his, time, kujula, kadphises, as, his, great, grandfather, vima, taktu, as, his, grandfather, vima, kadphises, as, his, father, and, himself, kanishka, for, king, kujula, kadphises, his, great, grandfather, and, for, king, vima, taktu, his, grandfather, and, for, king, vima, kadphises, his, father, and, also, for, himself, king, kanishka, kanishka, s, empire, was, certainly, vast, it, extended, from, southern, uzbekistan, and, tajikistan, north, of, the, amu, darya, oxus, in, the, north, west, to, northern, india, as, far, as, mathura, in, the, south, east, the, rabatak, inscription, even, claims, he, held, pataliputra, and, sri, champa, and, his, territory, also, included, kashmir, where, there, was, a, town, kanishkapur, modern, day, kanispora, named, after, him, not, far, from, the, baramulla, pass, and, which, still, contains, the, base, of, a, large, stupa, the, buddhist, text, r,

greek, script, that, had, one, additional, glyph, to, represent, sh, as, in, the, word, ku, sh, an, and, kani, sh, ka, on, his, coins, the, king, is, typically, depicted, as, a, bearded, man, in, a, long, coat, and, trousers, gathered, at, the, ankle, with, flames, emanating, from, his, shoulders, he, wears, large, rounded, boots, and, is, armed, with, a, long, sword, as, well, as, a, lance, he,

buddhist, council, in, kashmir, as, the, head, of, the, council, 76, it, was, presided, by, vasumitra, and, ashwaghosha, images, of, the, buddha, based, on, 32, physical, signs, were, made, during,

personally, seems, to, have, embraced, both, buddhism, and, the, persian, attributes, but, he, favored, buddhism, proven, by, his, devotion, to, buddhist, teachings, and, prayer, styles, depicted, in, various, books, related, to, kushan, empire, his, greatest, contribution, to, buddhist, architecture, was, the, kanishka, stupa, at, purushapura, modern, day, peshawar, archaeologists, who, rediscovered, the, base, of, it, in, 1908, 1909, estimated, that, this, stupa, had, a, diameter, of, 286, feet, 87, metres, reports, of, chinese, pilgrims, such, as, xuanzang, indicate, that, its, height, was, 600, to, 700, chinese, feet, roughly, 180, 210, metres, or, 591, 689, ft, and, it, was, covered, with, jewels, kanishka, is, said, to, have, been, particularly, close, to, the, buddhist, scholar, ashvaghosha, who, became, his, religious, advisor, in, his, later, years, the, buddhist, coins, of, kanishka, are, comparatively, rare, well, under, one, percent, of, all, known, coins, of, kanishka, several, show, kanishka, on, the, obverse, and, the, buddha, standing, on, the, reverse, a, few, also, show, the, shakyamuni, buddha, and, maitreya, like, all, coins, of, kanishka, the, design, is, rather, rough, and, proportions, tend, to, be, imprecise, the, image, of, the, buddha, is, often, slightly, overdone, with, oversize, ears, and, feet, spread, apart, in, the, same, fashion, as, the, kushan, king, three, types, of, kanishka, s, buddhist, coins, are, known, only, six, kushan, coins, of, the, buddha, are, known, in, gold, the, sixth, one, is, the, centerpiece, of, an, ancient, piece, of, jewellery, consisting, of, a, kanishka, buddha, coin, decorated, with, a, ring, of, heart, shaped, ruby, stones, all, these, coins, were, minted, in, gold, under, kanishka, i, and, are, in, two, different, denominations, a, dinar, of, about, 8, gm, roughly, similar, to, a, roman, aureus, and, a, quarter, dinar, of, about, 2, gm, about, the, size, of, an, obol, the, buddha, is, represented, wearing, the, monastic, robe, the, antaravasaka, the, uttarasanga, and, the, overcoat, sanghati, the, ears, are, extremely, large, and, long, a, symbolic, exaggeration, possibly, rendered, necessary, by, the, small, size, of, the, coins, but, otherwise, visible, in, some, later, gandharan, statues, of, the, buddha, typically, dated, to, the, 3rd, 4th, century, ce, illustration, left, he, has, an, abundant, topknot, covering, the, usnisha, often, highly, stylised, in, a, curly, or, often, globular, manner, also, visible, on, later, buddha, statues, of, gandhara, in, general, the, representation, of, the, buddha, on, these, coins, is, already, highly, symbolic, and, quite, distinct, from, the, more, naturalistic, and, hellenistic, images, seen, in, early, gandhara, sculptures, on, several, designs, a, mustache, is, apparent, the, palm, of, his, right, hand, bears, the, chakra, mark, and, his, brow, bear, the, urna, an, aureola, formed, by, one, two, or, three, lines, surrounds, him, the, full, gown, worn, by, the, buddha, on, the, coins, covering, both, shoulders, suggests, a, gandharan, model, rather, than, a, mathuran, one, the, shakyamuni, buddha, with, the, legend, sakamano, boudo, i, e, shakamuni, buddha, another, name, for, the, historic, buddha, siddharta, gautama, standing, to, front, with, left, hand, on, hip, and, forming, the, abhaya, mudra, with, the, right, hand, all, these, coins, are, in, copper, only, and, usually, rather, worn, the, gown, of, the, shakyamuni, buddha, is, quite, light, compared, to, that, on, the, coins, in, the, name, of, buddha, clearly, showing, the, outline, of, the, body, in, a, nearly, transparent, way, these, are, probably, the, first, two, layers, of, monastic, clothing, the, antaravasaka, and, the, uttarasanga, also, his, gown, is, folded, over, the, left, arm, rather, than, being, held, in, the, left, hand, as, above, a, feature, only, otherwise, known, in, the, bimaran, casket, and, suggestive, of, a, scarf, like, uttariya, he, has, an, abundant, topknot, covering, the, ushnisha, and, a, simple, or, double, halo, sometimes, radiating, surrounds, his, head, the, bodhisattva, maitreya, with, the, legend, metrago, boudo, cross, legged, on, a, throne, holding, a, water, pot, and, also, forming, the, abhaya, mudra, these, coins, are, only, known, in, copper, and, are, quite, worn, out, on, the, clearest, coins, maitreya, seems, to, be, wearing, the, armbands, of, an, indian, prince, a, feature, often, seen, on, the, statuary, of, maitreya, the, throne, is, decorated, with, small, columns, suggesting, that, the, coin, representation, of, maitreya, was, directly, copied, from, pre, existing, statuary, with, such, well, known, features, the, qualification, of, buddha, for, maitreya, is, inaccurate, as, he, is, instead, a, bodhisattva, he, is, the, buddha, of, the, future, the, iconography, of, these, three, types, is, very, different, from, that, of, the, other, deities, depicted, in, kanishka, s, coinage, whether, kanishka, s, deities, are, all, shown, from, the, side, the, buddhas, only, are, shown, frontally, indicating, that, they, were, copied, from, contemporary, frontal, representations, of, the, standing, and, seated, buddhas, in, statuary, both, representations, of, the, buddha, and, shakyamuni, have, both, shoulders, covered, by, their, monastic, gown, indicating, that, the, statues, used, as, models, were, from, the, gandhara, school, of, art, rather, than, mathura, several, buddhist, statues, are, directly, connected, to, the, reign, of, kanishka, such, as, several, bodhisattva, statues, from, the, art, of, mathura, while, a, few, other, from, gandhara, are, inscribed, with, a, date, in, an, era, which, is, now, thought, to, be, the, yavana, era, starting, in, 186, to, 175, bce, the, kanishka, casket, or, kanishka, reliquary, dated, to, the, first, year, of, kanishka, s, reign, in, 127, ce, was, discovered, in, a, deposit, chamber, under, kanishka, stupa, during, the, archaeological, excavations, in, 1908, 1909, in, shah, ji, ki, dheri, just, outside, the, present, day, ganj, gate, of, the, old, city, of, peshawar, it, is, today, at, the, peshawar, museum, and, a, copy, is, in, the, british, museum, it, is, said, to, have, contained, three, bone, fragments, of, the, buddha, which, are, now, housed, in, mandalay, burma, the, casket, is, dedicated, in, kharoshthi, the, inscription, reads, the, text, is, signed, by, the, maker, a, greek, artist, named, agesilas, who, oversaw, work, at, kanishka, s, stupas, caitya, confirming, the, direct, involvement, of, greeks, with, buddhist, realisations, at, such, a, late, date, the, servant, agisalaos, the, superintendent, of, works, at, the, vihara, of, kanishka, in, the, monastery, of, mahasena, dasa, agisala, nava, karmi, ana, kaniskasa, vihara, mahasenasa, sangharame, the, lid, of, the, casket, shows, the, buddha, on, a, lotus, pedestal, and, worshipped, by, brahma, and, indra, the, edge, of, the, lid, is, decorated, by, a, frieze, of, flying, geese, the, body, of, the, casket, represents, a, kushan, monarch, probably, kanishka, in, person, with, the, iranian, sun, and, moon, gods, on, his, side, on, the, sides, are, two, images, of, a, seated, buddha, worshiped, by, royal, figures, can, be, assumed, as, kanishka, a, garland, supported, by, cherubs, goes, around, the, scene, in, typical, hellenistic, style, the, attribution, of, the, casket, to, kanishka, has, been, recently, disputed, essentially, on, stylistic, ground, for, example, the, ruler, shown, on, the, casket, is, not, bearded, to, the, contrary, of, kanishka, instead, the, casket, is, often, attributed, to, kanishka, s, successor, huvishka, in, buddhist, tradition, kanishka, is, often, described, as, an, aggressive, hot, tempered, rigid, strict, and, a, bit, harsh, kind, of, king, before, he, got, converted, to, buddhism, of, which, he, was, very, fond, and, after, his, conversion, to, buddhism, he, became, an, openhearted, benevolent, and, faithful, ruler, as, in, the, sri, dharma, pitaka, nidana, sutra, additionally, the, arrival, of, kanishka, was, reportedly, foretold, or, was, predicted, by, the, buddha, as, well, as, the, construction, of, his, stupa, the, same, story, is, repeated, in, a, khotanese, scroll, found, at, dunhuang, which, first, described, how, kanishka, would, arrive, 400, years, after, the, death, of, the, buddha, the, account, also, describes, how, kanishka, came, to, raise, his, stupa, chinese, pilgrims, to, india, such, as, xuanzang, who, travelled, there, around, 630, ce, also, relays, the, story, king, kanishka, because, of, his, deeds, was, highly, respected, regarded, honored, by, all, the, people, he, ruled, and, governed, and, was, regarded, the, greatest, king, who, ever, lived, because, of, his, kindness, humbleness, and, sense, of, equality, and, self, righteousness, among, all, aspects, thus, such, great, deeds, and, character, of, the, king, kanishka, made, his, name, immortal, and, thus, he, was, regarded, the, king, of, kings, buddhist, monks, from, the, region, of, gandhara, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, and, the, transmission, of, buddhist, ideas, in, the, direction, of, northern, asia, from, the, middle, of, the, 2nd, century, ce, the, kushan, monk, lokaksema, c, 178, ce, became, the, first, translator, of, mahayana, buddhist, scriptures, into, chinese, and, established, a, translation, bureau, at, the, chinese, capital, loyang, central, asian, and, east, asian, buddhist, monks, appear, to, have, maintained, strong, exchanges, for, the, following, centuries, kanishka, was, probably, succeeded, by, huvishka, how, and, when, this, came,
