allegorical, figures, that, is, from, a, completely, female, perspective, together, they, create, a, forum, to, speak, on, issues, of, consequence, to, all, women, only, female, voices, examples, and, opinions, provide, evidence, within, this, text, through, lady, reason, in, particular, christine, argues, that, stereotypes, of, women, can, be, sustained, only, if, women, are, prevented, from, entering, into, the, conversation, in, city, of, ladies, christine, deliberated, on, the, debate, of, whether, the, virtues, of, men, and, women, differ, a, frequently, debated, topic, in, late, medieval, europe, particularly, in, the, context, of, aristotelian, virtue, ethics, and, his, views, on, women, christine, repeatedly, used, the, theological, argument, that, men, and, women, are, created, in, god, s, image, and, both, have, souls, capable, of, embracing, god, s, goodness, among, the, inhabitants, of, the, city, of, ladies, are, female, saints, women, from, the, old, testament, and, virtuous, women, from, the, pagan, antiquity, as, portrayed, by, giovanni, boccaccio, within, her, allegorical, city, of, illustrious, ladies, she, reimagines, the, mythological, figure, medusa,

harm, de, pizan, is, the, first, to, provide, a, feminist, revisionist, perspective, of, the, ancient, myth, in, the, treasure, of, the, city, of, ladies, christine, addressed, the, community, of, women, with, the, stated, objective, of, instructing, them, on, the, means, of, achieving, virtue, she, took, the, position, that, all, women, were, capable, of, humility, diligence, and, moral, rectitude, and, that, duly, educated, all, women, could, become, worthy, residents, of, the, imaginary, city, of, ladies, drawing, on, her, own, life, christine, advised, women, on, how, to, navigate, the, perils, of, early, 15th, century, french, society, with, reference, to, augustine, of, hippo, and, other, saints, christine, offered, advice, on, how, the, noble, lady, could, achieve, the, love, of, god, christine, speaks, through, the, allegorical, figures, of, god, s, daughters, reason, rectitude, and, justice, who, represent, the, three, virtues, most, important, to, women, s, success, through, secular, examples, of, these, three, virtues, christine, urged, women, to, discover, meaning, and, achieve, worthy, acts, in, their, lives, christine, argued, that, women, s, success, depends, on, their, ability, to, manage, and, mediate, by, speaking, and, writing, effectively, christine, specifically, sought, out, other, women, to, collaborate, in, the, creation, of, her, work,

and, contemporary, intellectuals, kept, copies, of, her, works, in, their, libraries, after, her, death, in, 1430, christine, s, influence, was, acknowledged, by, a, variety, of, authors, and, her, writings, remained, popular, while, de, pizan, s, mixture, of, classical, philosophy, and, humanistic, ideals, was, in, line, with, the, style, of, other, popular, authors, at, the, time, her, outspoken, defence, of, women, was, an, anomaly, in, her, works, she, vindicated, women, against, popular, misogynist, texts, such, as, ovid, s, art, of, love, jean, de, meun, s, romance, of, the, rose, and, matheolus, s, lamentations, her, book, le, livre, de, la, cit, des, dames, remained, in, print, christine, s, le, livre, des, trois, vertus, the, treasure, of, the, city, of, ladies,
