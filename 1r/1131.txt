to, 889, despite, a, number, of, military, setbacks, the, reign, of, boris, i, was, marked, with, significant, events, that, shaped, bulgarian, and, european, history, with, the, christianization, of, bulgaria, in, 864, paganism, was, abolished, a, skillful, diplomat, boris, i, successfully, exploited, the, conflict, between, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, and, the, papacy, to, secure, an, autocephalous, bulgarian, church, thus, dealing, with, the, nobility, s, concerns, about, byzantine, interference, in, bulgaria, s, internal, affairs, when, in, 885, the, disciples, of, saints, cyril, and, methodius, were, banished, from, great, moravia, boris, i, gave, them, refuge, and, provided, assistance, which, saved, the, glagolithic, and, later, promoted, the, development, of, the, cyrillic, script, in, preslav, and, the, slavic, literature, after, he, abdicated, in, 889, his, eldest, son, and, successor, tried, to, restore, the, old, pagan, religion, but, was, deposed, by, boris, i, during, the, council, of, preslav, which, followed, that, event, the, byzantine, clergy, was, replaced, with, bulgarian, and, the, greek, language, was, replaced, with, what, is, now, known, as, old, church, slavonic, he, is, regarded, as, a, saint, in, the, orthodox, church, as, the, prince, and, baptizer, of, bulgaria, and, as, equal, to, the, apostles, with, his, feast, day, observed, on, may, 2, and, in, synaxis, of, all, venerable, and, holy, fathers, of, bulgaria, movable, holiday, on, the, 2nd, sunday, of, pentecost, the, most, common, theory, is, that, the, name, boris, is, of, bulgar, origin, after, his, official, act, of, conversion, to, christianity, boris, adopted, the, christian, name, michael, he, is, sometimes, called, boris, michael, in, historical, research, the, only, direct, evidence, of, boris, s, title, are, his, seals, and, the, inscription, found, near, the, town, of, ballsh, modern, albania, and, at, varna, there, he, is, called, by, the, byzantine, title, archon, of, bulgaria, which, is, usually, translated, as, ruler, and, in, the, 10, 11th, centuries, also, as, knyaz, bulg, in, the, bulgarian, sources, from, that, period, boris, i, is, called, knyaz, and, during, the, second, bulgarian, empire, tsar, in, modern, historiography, boris, is, called, by, different, titles, most, historians, accept, that, he, changed, his, title, after, his, conversion, to, christianity, according, to, them, before, the, baptism, he, had, the, title, khan, or, kanasubigi, and, after, that, knyaz, the, early, 9th, century, marked, the, beginning, of, a, fierce, rivalry, between, the, greek, east, and, latin, west, which, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, schism, between, the, orthodox, church, in, constantinople, and, the, catholic, church, in, rome, as, early, as, 781, the, empress, irene, began, to, seek, a, closer, relationship, with, the, carolingian, dynasty, and, the, papacy, she, negotiated, a, marriage, between, her, son, constantine, and, rotrude, a, daughter, of, charlemagne, by, his, third, wife, hildegard, irene, went, as, far, as, to, send, an, official, to, instruct, the, frankish, princess, in, greek, however, irene, herself, broke, off, the, engagement, in, 787, against, her, son, s, wishes, when, the, second, council, of, nicaea, of, 787, reintroduced, the, veneration, of, icons, under, empress, irene, the, result, was, not, recognized, by, charlemagne, since, no, frankish, emissaries, had, been, invited, even, though, charlemagne, was, by, then, ruling, more, than, three, provinces, of, the, old, roman, empire, while, this, improved, relations, with, the, papacy, it, did, not, prevent, the, outbreak, of, a, war, with, the, franks, who, took, over, istria, and, benevento, in, 788, when, charlemagne, was, proclaimed, emperor, of, the, holy, roman, empire, by, leo, iii, the, pope, was, effectively, nullifying, the, legitimacy, of, irene, he, certainly, desired, to, increase, the, influence, of, the, papacy, and, to, honour, his, protector, charlemagne, irene, like, many, of, her, predecessors, since, justinian, i, was, too, weak, to, protect, rome, and, its, much, reduced, citizenry, and, the, city, was, not, being, ruled, by, any, emperor, thus, charlemagne, s, assumption, of, the, imperial, title, was, not, seen, as, an, usurpation, in, the, eyes, of, the, franks, or, italians, it, was, however, seen, as, such, in, byzantium, but, protests, by, irene, and, her, successor, nicephorus, i, had, no, great, effect, mojm, r, i, managed, to, unite, some, slavic, princes, and, established, great, moravia, in, 833, his, successor, rastislav, also, fought, against, the, germans, both, states, tried, to, maintain, good, relations, with, bulgaria, on, account, of, its, considerable, military, power, boris, i, was, the, son, and, successor, of, presian, i, of, bulgaria, in, 852, he, sent, emissaries, to, eastern, francia, to, confirm, the, peace, treaty, of, 845, at, the, time, of, his, accession, he, threatened, the, byzantines, with, an, invasion, but, his, armies, did, not, attack, and, he, received, a, small, area, in, strandzha, to, the, southeast, the, peace, treaty, was, not, signed, however, although, both, states, exchanged, temporary, delegations, in, 854, the, moravian, prince, rastislav, persuaded, boris, i, to, help, him, against, east, francia, according, to, some, sources, some, franks, bribed, the, bulgarian, monarch, to, attack, louis, the, german, the, bulgarian, slav, campaign, was, a, disaster, and, louis, scored, a, great, victory, and, invaded, bulgaria, at, the, same, time, the, croats, waged, a, war, against, the, bulgarians, both, peoples, had, coexisted, peacefully, up, to, that, time, suggesting, that, the, croats, were, paid, by, louis, to, attack, bulgaria, and, distract, boris, attention, from, his, alliance, with, great, moravia, kanasubigi, boris, could, not, achieve, any, success, and, both, sides, exchanged, gifts, and, settled, for, peace, as, a, result, of, the, military, actions, in, 855, the, peace, between, bulgaria, and, eastern, francia, was, restored, and, rastislav, was, forced, to, fight, against, louis, alone, in, the, meantime, a, conflict, between, the, byzantines, and, bulgarians, had, started, in, 855, 856, and, boris, distracted, by, his, conflict, with, louis, lost, philippopolis, plovdiv, the, region, of, zagora, and, the, ports, around, the, gulf, of, burgas, on, the, black, sea, to, the, byzantine, army, led, by, michael, iii, and, the, caesar, bardas, after, the, death, of, knez, vlastimir, of, serbia, circa, 850, his, state, was, divided, between, his, sons, vlastimir, and, boris, father, had, fought, against, each, other, in, the, bulgarian, serbian, war, of, 839, 842, which, resulted, in, a, serbian, victory, and, boris, sought, to, avenge, that, defeat, in, 853, or, 854, the, bulgarian, army, led, by, vladimir, rasate, the, son, of, boris, i, invaded, serbia, with, the, aim, of, replacing, the, byzantine, overlordship, over, the, serbs, the, serbian, army, was, led, by, mutimir, and, his, two, brothers, they, defeated, the, bulgarians, capturing, vladimir, and, 12, boyars, boris, i, and, mutimir, agreed, to, peace, and, perhaps, an, alliance, and, mutimir, sent, his, sons, pribislav, and, stefan, to, the, border, to, escort, the, prisoners, where, they, exchanged, items, as, a, sign, of, peace, boris, himself, gave, them, rich, gifts, while, he, was, given, two, slaves, two, falcons, two, dogs, and, 80, furs, an, internal, conflict, among, the, serbian, brothers, resulted, in, mutimir, banishing, the, two, younger, brothers, to, the, bulgarian, court, mutimir, however, kept, a, nephew, petar, at, his, court, for, political, reasons, the, reason, for, the, feud, is, not, known, though, it, is, postulated, that, it, was, a, result, of, treachery, petar, would, later, defeat, pribislav, mutimir, s, son, and, take, the, serbian, throne, there, are, a, number, of, versions, as, to, why, boris, converted, to, christianity, some, historians, attribute, it, to, the, intervention, of, his, sister, who, had, already, converted, while, being, at, constantinople, another, story, mentions, a, greek, slave, in, the, ruler, s, court, a, more, mythological, version, is, the, one, in, which, boris, is, astonished, and, frightened, by, an, icon, of, judgement, day, and, thus, decides, to, adopt, christianity, richard, b, spence, sees, the, decision, as, deliberate, practical, and, politic, for, a, variety, of, diplomatic, reasons, boris, became, interested, in, converting, to, christianity, in, order, to, both, extend, his, control, over, the, slavic, world, and, gain, an, ally, against, one, of, the, most, powerful, foes, of, the, bulgars, the, byzantine, empire, boris, sought, to, establish, an, alliance, with, louis, the, german, against, ratislav, of, moravia, through, this, alliance, louis, promised, to, supply, boris, with, missionaries, which, would, have, effectively, brought, the, bulgars, under, the, roman, church, however, late, in, 863, the, byzantine, empire, under, emperor, michael, iii, declared, war, on, boris, and, the, bulgars, during, a, period, of, famine, and, natural, disasters, taken, by, surprise, boris, was, forced, to, make, peace, with, the, byzantines, promising, to, convert, to, christianity, according, to, the, eastern, rites, in, exchange, for, peace, and, territorial, concessions, in, thrace, he, regained, the, region, of, zagora, recently, recovered, by, the, byzantines, at, the, beginning, of, 864, boris, was, secretly, baptized, at, pliska, by, an, embassy, of, byzantine, clergymen, together, with, his, family, and, select, members, of, the, bulgarian, nobility, with, emperor, michael, iii, as, his, godfather, boris, also, adopted, the, christian, name, michael, separate, from, diplomatic, concerns, boris, was, interested, in, converting, himself, and, the, bulgarians, to, christianity, to, resolve, the, disunity, within, the, bulgarian, society, when, he, ascended, to, the, throne, the, bulgars, and, slavs, were, separate, elements, within, boris, kingdom, the, minority, bulgars, constituting, a, military, aristocracy, richard, spence, compares, it, to, the, relationship, between, the, normans, and, saxons, in, england, religious, plurality, further, contributed, to, divisions, within, the, society, the, slavs, had, their, own, polytheistic, belief, system, while, the, bulgar, elite, believed, in, tangra, the, sky, god, or, god, of, heaven, the, arrival, of, methodius, and, his, followers, introduced, the, cyrillic, alphabet, freeing, the, bulgarians, from, dependence, on, greek, as, a, written, and, liturgical, language, a, slavic, christian, culture, developed, that, helped, unify, the, realm, after, his, baptism, the, first, major, task, that, boris, undertook, was, the, baptism, of, his, subjects, and, for, this, task, he, appealed, to, byzantine, priests, between, 864, and, 866, at, the, same, time, boris, sought, further, instruction, on, how, to, lead, a, christian, lifestyle, and, society, and, how, to, set, up, an, autocephalous, church, from, the, byzantine, patriarch, photios, photios, answer, proved, less, than, satisfactory, and, boris, sought, to, gain, a, more, favorable, settlement, from, the, papacy, boris, dispatched, emissaries, led, by, the, kavhan, peter, with, a, long, list, of, questions, to, pope, nicholas, i, at, rome, in, august, 866, and, obtained, 106, detailed, answers, detailing, the, essence, of, religion, law, politics, customs, and, personal, faith, stemming, from, his, concerns, with, the, baptism, of, the, bulgarians, boris, also, complained, to, nicholas, about, the, abuses, perpetrated, by, the, byzantine, priests, responsible, for, baptizing, the, bulgarians, and, how, he, could, go, about, correcting, the, consequences, resulting, from, these, abuses, the, pope, temporarily, glossed, over, the, controversial, question, of, the, autocephalous, status, desired, by, boris, for, his, church, and, sent, a, large, group, of, missionaries, to, continue, the, conversion, of, bulgaria, in, accordance, with, the, western, rite, bulgaria, s, shift, towards, the, papacy, infuriated, patriarch, photios, who, wrote, an, encyclical, to, the, eastern, clergy, in, 867, in, which, he, denounced, the, practices, associated, with, the, western, rite, and, rome, s, ecclesiastical, intervention, in, bulgaria, this, occasioned, the, photian, schism, which, was, a, major, step, in, the, rift, between, the, eastern, and, western, churches, to, deliver, his, response, to, boris, questions, pope, nicholas, i, sent, two, bishops, to, bulgaria, paul, of, populonia, and, formosus, of, porto, the, pope, expected, that, these, priests, would, execute, their, episcopal, responsibilities, to, address, boris, concerns, but, did, not, intend, for, them, to, be, elevated, to, the, positions, that, they, assumed, in, the, bulgar, hierarchy, in, bulgaria, the, activities, of, bishop, formosus, later, pope, formosus, met, with, success, until, the, pope, rejected, boris, request, to, nominate, formosus, as, archbishop, of, bulgaria, nicholas, justified, the, rejection, of, the, request, by, arguing, that, it, was, uncanonical, to, transfer, an, already, established, bishop, from, one, see, to, another, the, new, pope, adrian, ii, refused, boris, request, for, a, similar, nomination, of, either, formosus, or, deacon, marinus, later, pope, marinus, i, after, which, bulgaria, began, to, shift, towards, constantinople, once, again, at, the, fourth, council, of, constantinople, in, 870, the, position, of, the, bulgarian, church, was, reopened, by, bulgarian, envoys, and, the, eastern, patriarchs, adjudicated, in, favor, of, constantinople, this, determined, the, future, of, the, bulgarian, orthodox, church, which, was, granted, the, status, of, an, autocephalous, archbishopric, by, the, patriarchate, of, constantinople, and, an, archbishop, of, its, own, later, in, the, 870s, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, surrendered, bulgaria, to, the, papacy, but, this, concession, was, purely, nominal, as, it, did, not, affect, the, actual, position, of, bulgaria, s, autocephalous, church, the, christianization, of, the, bulgarians, as, a, result, of, boris, actions, had, profound, effects, not, only, on, the, religious, belief, system, of, the, bulgarians, but, also, the, structure, of, the, bulgarian, government, upon, embracing, christianity, boris, took, on, the, title, of, knyaz, and, joined, the, community, of, nations, that, embraced, christ, to, the, great, delight, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, toward, the, end, of, his, reign, boris, began, to, increase, the, number, of, native, bulgarian, clergy, consequently, boris, began, to, send, bulgarians, to, constantinople, to, obtain, a, monastic, education, and, some, of, these, bulgarians, returned, to, their, homeland, to, serve, as, clergymen, in, 885, boris, was, presented, with, a, new, opportunity, to, establish, a, native, clergy, when, slavic, speaking, disciples, of, st, cyril, and, st, methodius, were, forced, to, flee, from, moravia, after, a, german, inspired, reaction, to, the, death, of, the, apostle, in, 886, boris, governor, of, belgrade, welcomed, the, disciples, of, saint, cyril, and, saint, methodius, who, were, exiled, from, great, moravia, into, bulgaria, and, sent, them, on, to, boris, in, pliska, boris, happily, greeted, two, of, these, disciples, clement, of, ohrid, and, naum, of, preslav, who, were, of, noble, bulgarian, slavic, origin, to, utilize, the, disciple, s, talents, boris, commissioned, clement, to, be, a, teacher, in, the, province, of, kutmichevitsa, both, clement, and, naum, were, instrumental, in, furthering, the, cultural, linguistic, and, spiritual, works, of, cyril, and, methodius, they, set, up, educational, centers, in, pliska, and, in, ohrid, to, further, the, development, of, slavonic, letters, and, liturgy, clement, later, trained, thousands, of, slavonic, speaking, priests, who, replaced, the, greek, speaking, clergy, from, constantinople, still, present, in, bulgaria, the, script, that, was, originally, developed, by, cyril, and, methodius, is, known, as, the, glagolitic, alphabet, in, bulgaria, clement, of, ohrid, and, naum, of, preslav, created, or, rather, compiled, the, new, bulgarian, script, later, called, cyrillic, that, was, declared, the, official, alphabet, in, 893, old, bulgarian, was, declared, as, the, official, language, in, the, same, year, in, the, following, centuries, this, script, was, adopted, by, other, slavic, peoples, and, states, the, introduction, of, slavic, liturgy, paralleled, boris, continued, development, of, churches, and, monasteries, throughout, his, realm, conversion, to, christianity, met, great, opposition, among, the, bulgarian, elite, some, refused, to, become, christians, while, others, apostatized, after, baptism, and, started, a, rebellion, against, boris, for, forcing, them, to, be, baptized, some, people, did, not, object, necessarily, to, the, christian, religion, but, to, the, fact, that, it, was, brought, by, foreign, priests, which, as, a, result, established, external, foreign, policy, by, breaking, the, power, of, the, old, cults, boris, reduced, the, influence, of, the, boyars, who, resisted, the, khan, s, authority, in, the, summer, of, 865, a, group, of, bulgar, aristocrats, boyars, started, an, open, revolt, boris, ruthlessly, suppressed, it, and, executed, 52, boyars, together, with, their, entire, families, thus, the, christianization, continued, in, 889, boris, abdicated, the, throne, and, became, a, monk, his, son, and, successor, vladimir, attempted, a, pagan, reaction, which, brought, boris, out, of, retirement, in, 893, vladimir, was, defeated, and, boris, had, him, blinded, his, wife, shaved, and, sent, to, a, monastery, boris, gathered, the, council, of, preslav, placing, his, third, son, tsar, simeon, i, of, bulgaria, on, the, throne, threatening, him, with, the, same, fate, if, he, too, apostatized, boris, returned, to, his, monastery, emerging, once, again, in, c, 895, to, help, simeon, fight, the, magyars, who, had, invaded, bulgaria, in, alliance, with, the, byzantines, after, the, passing, of, this, crisis, boris, resumed, monastic, life, and, died, in, 907, the, location, of, his, retreat, where, perhaps, he, was, interred, is, not, certain, it, may, be, near, preslav, or, pliska, or, in, a, ravna, monastery, near, varna, st, boris, peak, on,
