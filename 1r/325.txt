contributed, emerson, had, called, for, the, first, truly, american, poet, saying, that, aspects, of, america, are, yet, unsung, yet, america, is, a, poem, in, our, eyes, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, was, widely, distributed, and, stirred, up, significant, interest, in, part, due, to, emerson, s, praise, but, was, occasionally, criticized, for, the, seemingly, obscene, nature, of, the, poetry, geologist, peter, lesley, wrote, to, emerson, calling, the, book, trashy, profane, obscene, and, the, author, a, pretentious, ass, whitman, embossed, a, quote, from, emerson, s,

country, absorbs, him, as, affectionately, as, he, has, absorbed, it, he, believed, there, was, a, vital, symbiotic, relationship, between, the, poet, and, society, he, emphasized, this, connection, especially, in, song, of, myself, by, using, an, all, powerful, first, person, narration, an, american, epic, it, deviated, from, the, historic, use, of, an, elevated, hero, and, instead, assumed, the, identity, of, the, common, people, leaves, of, grass, also, responded, to, the, impact, of, rapid, urbanization, in, the, united, states, on, the, masses, whitman, was, a, vocal, proponent, of, temperance, and, in, his, youth, rarely, drank, alcohol, he, once, stated, he, did, not, taste, strong, liquor, until, he, was, 30, and, occasionally, argued, for, prohibition, his, first, novel, franklin, evans, or, the, inebriate, published, november, 23, 1842, is, a, temperance, novel, whitman, wrote, the, novel, at, the, height, of, the, popularity, of, the, washingtonian, movement, a, movement, that, was, plagued, with, contradictions, as, was, franklin, evans, years, later, whitman, claimed, he, was, embarrassed, by, the, book, and, called, it, damned, rot, he, dismissed, it, by, saying, he, wrote, the, novel, in, three, days, solely, for, money, while, under, the, influence, of, alcohol, even, so, he, wrote, other, pieces, recommending, temperance, including, the, madman, and, a, short, story, reuben, s, last, wish, later, in, life, he, was, more, liberal, with, alcohol, enjoying, local, wines, and, champagne, whitman, was, deeply, influenced, by, deism, he, denied, any, one, faith, was, more, important, than, another, and, embraced, all, religions, equally, in, song, of, myself, he, gave, an, inventory, of, major, religions, and, indicated, he, respected, and, accepted, all, of, them, a, sentiment, he, further, emphasized, in, his, poem, with, antecedents, affirming, i, adopt, each, theory, myth, god, and, demi, god, i, see, that, the, old, accounts, bibles, genealogies, are, true, without, exception, in, 1874, he, was, invited, to, write, a, poem, about, the, spiritualism, movement, to, which, he, responded, it, seems, to, me, nearly, altogether, a, poor, cheap, crude, humbug, whitman, was, a, religious, skeptic, though, he, accepted, all, churches, he, believed, in, none, god, to, whitman, was, both, immanent, and, transcendent, and, the, human, soul, was, immortal, and, in, a, state, of, progressive, development, american, philosophy, an, encyclopedia, classes, him, as, one, of, several, figures, who, took, a, more, pantheist, or, pandeist, approach, by, rejecting, views, of, god, as, separate, from, the, world, though, biographers, continue, to, debate, whitman, s, sexuality, he, is, usually, described, as, either, homosexual, or, bisexual, in, his, feelings, and, attractions, whitman, s, sexual, orientation, is, generally, assumed, on, the, basis, of, his, poetry, though, this, assumption, has, been, disputed, his, poetry, depicts, love, and, sexuality, in, a, more, earthy, individualistic, way, common, in, american, culture, before, the, medicalization, of, sexuality, in, the, late, 19th, century, though, leaves, of, grass, was, often, labeled, pornographic, or, obscene, only, one, critic, remarked, on, its, author, s, presumed, sexual, activity, in, a, november, 1855, review, rufus, wilmot, griswold, suggested, whitman, was, guilty, of, that, horrible, sin, not, to, be, mentioned, among, christians, the, manuscript, of, his, love, poem, once, i, pass, d, through, a, populous, city, written, when, whitman, was, 29, indicates, it, was, originally, about, a, man, late, in, his, life, when, whitman, was, asked, outright, whether, his, calamus, poems, were, homosexual, john, addington, symonds, inquired, about, athletic, friendship, the, love, of, man, for, man, or, the, love, of, friends, he, chose, not, to, respond, whitman, had, intense, friendships, with, many, men, and, boys, throughout, his, life, some, biographers, have, suggested, that, he, did, not, actually, engage, in, sexual, relationships, with, males, while, others, cite, letters, journal, entries, and, other, sources, that, they, claim, as, proof, of, the, sexual, nature, of, some, of, his, relationships, english, poet, and, critic, john, addington, symonds, spent, 20, years, in, correspondence, trying, to, pry, the, answer, from, him, in, 1890, symonds, wrote, to, whitman, in, your, conception, of, comradeship, do, you, contemplate, the, possible, intrusion, of, those, semi, sexual, emotions, and, actions, which, no, doubt, do, occur, between, men, in, reply, whitman, denied, that, his, work, had, any, such, implication, asserting, hat, the, calamus, part, has, even, allow, d, the, possibility, of, such, construction, as, mention, d, is, terrible, i, am, fain, to, hope, the, pages, themselves, are, not, to, be, even, mention, d, for, such, gratuitous, and, quite, at, this, time, entirely, undream, d, unreck, d, possibility, of, morbid, inferences, wh, are, disavow, d, by, me, and, seem, damnable, and, insisting, that, he, had, fathered, six, illegitimate, children, some, contemporary, scholars, are, skeptical, of, the, veracity, of, whitman, s, denial, or, the, existence, of, the, children, he, claimed, in, a, letter, dated, august, 21, 1890, whitman, claimed, i, have, had, six, children, two, are, dead, this, claim, has, never, been, corroborated, peter, doyle, may, be, the, most, likely, candidate, for, the, love, of, whitman, s, life, doyle, was, a, bus, conductor, whom, whitman, met, around, 1866, and, the, two, were, inseparable, for, several, years, interviewed, in, 1895, doyle, said, we, were, familiar, at, once, i, put, my, hand, on, his, knee, we, understood, he, did, not, get, out, at, the, end, of, the, trip, in, fact, went, all, the, way, back, with, me, in, his, notebooks, whitman, disguised, doyle, s, initials, using, the, code, 16, 4, p, d, being, the, 16th, and, 4th, letters, of, the, alphabet, oscar, wilde, met, whitman, in, the, united, states, in, 1882, and, later, told, the, homosexual, rights, activist, george, cecil, ives, that, i, have, the, kiss, of, walt, whitman, still, on, my, lips, the, only, explicit, description, of, whitman, s, sexual, activities, is, secondhand, in, 1924, edward, carpenter, told, gavin, arthur, of, a, sexual, encounter, in, his, youth, with, whitman, the, details, of, which, arthur, recorded, in, his, journal, another, possible, lover, was, bill, duckett, as, a, teenager, he, lived, on, the, same, street, in, camden, and, moved, in, with, whitman, living, with, him, a, number, of, years, and, serving, him, in, various, roles, duckett, was, 15, when, whitman, bought, his, house, at, 328, mickle, street, from, at, least, 1880, duckett, and, his, grandmother, lydia, watson, were, boarders, subletting, space, from, another, family, at, 334, mickle, street, because, of, this, proximity, duckett, and, whitman, met, as, neighbors, their, relationship, was, close, with, the, youth, sharing, whitman, s, money, when, he, had, it, whitman, described, their, friendship, as, thick, though, some, biographers, describe, duckett, as, a, boarder, others, identify, him, as, a, lover, their, photograph, together, is, described, as, modeled, on, the, conventions, of, a, marriage, portrait, part, of, a, series, of, portraits, of, the, poet, with, his, young, male, friends, and, encrypting, male, male, desire, another, young, man, with, whom, whitman, had, an, intense, relationship, was, harry, stafford, with, whose, family, whitman, stayed, when, at, timber, creek, and, whom, he, first, met, in, 1876, when, stafford, was, 18, whitman, gave, stafford, a, ring, which, was, returned, and, re, given, over, the, course, of, a, stormy, relationship, lasting, several, years, of, that, ring, stafford, wrote, to, whitman, you, know, when, you, put, it, on, there, was, but, one, thing, to, part, it, from, me, and, that, was, death, there, is, also, some, evidence, that, whitman, had, sexual, relationships, with, women, he, had, a, romantic, friendship, with, a, new, york, actress, ellen, grey, in, the, spring, of, 1862, but, it, is, not, known, whether, it, was, also, sexual, he, still, had, a, photograph, of, her, decades, later, when, he, moved, to, camden, and, he, called, her, an, old, sweetheart, of, mine, toward, the, end, of, his, life, he, often, told, stories, of, previous, girlfriends, and, sweethearts, and, denied, an, allegation, from, the, new, york, herald, that, he, had, never, had, a, love, affair, as, whitman, biographer, jerome, loving, wrote, the, discussion, of, whitman, s, sexual, orientation, will, probably, continue, in, spite, of, whatever, evidence, emerges, whitman, was, an, adherent, of, the, shakespeare, authorship, question, refusing, to, believe, in, the, historical, attribution, of, the, works, to, william, shakespeare, of, stratford, upon, avon, in, 1888, whitman, commented, in, november, boughs, conceiv, d, out, of, the, fullest, heat, and, pulse, of, european, feudalism, personifying, in, unparalleled, ways, the, medieval, aristocracy, its, towering, spirit, of, ruthless, and, gigantic, caste, with, its, own, peculiar, air, and, arrogance, no, mere, imitation, only, one, of, the, wolfish, earls, so, plenteous, in, the, plays, themselves, or, some, born, descendant, and, knower, might, seem, to, be, the, true, author, of, those, amazing, works, works, in, some, respects, greater, than, anything, else, in, recorded, literature, like, many, in, the, free, soil, party, who, were, concerned, about, the, threat, slavery, would, pose, to, free, white, labor, and, northern, businessmen, exploiting, the, newly, colonized, western, territories, whitman, opposed, the, extension, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, and, supported, the, wilmot, proviso, at, first, he, was, opposed, to, abolitionism, believing, the, movement, did, more, harm, than, good, in, 1846, he, wrote, that, the, abolitionists, had, in, fact, slowed, the, advancement, of, their, cause, by, their, ultraism, and, officiousness, his, main, concern, was, that, their, methods, disrupted, the, democratic, process, as, did, the, refusal, of, the, southern, states, to, put, the, interests, of, the, nation, as, a, whole, above, their, own, in, 1856, in, his, unpublished, the, eighteenth, presidency, addressing, the, men, of, the, south, he, wrote, you, are, either, to, abolish, slavery, or, it, will, abolish, you, whitman, also, subscribed, to, the, widespread, opinion, that, even, free, african, americans, should, not, vote, and, was, concerned, at, the, increasing, number, of, african, americans, in, the, legislature, as, david, reynolds, notes, whitman, wrote, in, prejudiced, terms, of, these, new, voters, and, politicians, calling, them, blacks, with, about, as, much, intellect, and, calibre, in, the, mass, as, so, many, baboons, george, hutchinson, and, david, drews, have, written, that, what, little, is, known, about, the, early, development, of, whitman, s, racial, awareness, suggests, that, he, imbibed, the, prevailing, white, prejudices, of, his, time, and, place, thinking, of, black, people, as, servile, shiftless, ignorant, and, given, to, stealing, but, that, despite, his, views, remaining, largely, unchanged, readers, of, the, twentieth, century, including, black, ones, imagined, him, as, a, fervent, antiracist, whitman, is, often, described, as, america, s, national, poet, creating, an, image, of, the, united, states, for, itself, although, he, is, often, considered, a, champion, of, democracy, and, equality, whitman, constructs, a, hierarchy, with, himself, at, the, head, america, below, and, the, rest, of, the, world, in, a, subordinate, position, in, his, study, the, pragmatic, whitman, reimagining, american, democracy, stephen, john, mack, suggests, that, critics, who, tend, to, ignore, it, should, look, again, at, whitman, s, nationalism, whitman, s, seemingly, mawkish, celebrations, of, the, united, states, one, of, those, problematic, features, of, his, works, that, teachers, and, critics, read, past, or, explain, away, xv, xvi, nathanael, o, reilly, in, an, essay, on, walt, whitman, s, nationalism, in, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, claims, that, whitman, s, imagined, america, is, arrogant, expansionist, hierarchical, racist, and, exclusive, such, an, america, is, unacceptable, to, native, americans, african, americans, immigrants, the, disabled, the, infertile, and, all, those, who, value, equal, rights, whitman, s, nationalism, avoided, issues, concerning, the, treatment, of, native, americans, as, george, hutchinson, and, david, drews, further, suggest, in, an, essay, racial, attitudes, clearly, whitman, could, not, consistently, reconcile, the, ingrained, even, foundational, racist, character, of, the, united, states, with, its, egalitarian, ideals, he, could, not, even, reconcile, such, contradictions, in, his, own, psyche, the, authors, concluded, their, essay, with, because, of, the, radically, democratic, and, egalitarian, aspects, of, his, poetry, readers, generally, expect, and, desire, for, whitman, to, be, among, the, literary, heroes, that, transcended, the, racist, pressures, that, abounded, in, all, spheres, of, public, discourse, during, the, nineteenth, century, he, did, not, at, least, not, consistently, nonetheless, his, poetry, has, been, a, model, for, democratic, poets, of, all, nations, and, races, right, up, to, our, own, day, how, whitman, could, have, been, so, prejudiced, and, yet, so, effective, in, conveying, an, egalitarian, and, antiracist, sensibility, in, his, poetry, is, a, puzzle, yet, to, be, adequately, addressed, in, reference, to, the, mexican, american, war, whitman, wrote, in, 1864, that, mexico, was, the, only, to, whom, we, have, ever, really, done, wrong, in, 1883, celebrating, the, 333rd, anniversary, of, santa, fe, whitman, argued, that, the, indigenous, and, spanish, indian, elements, would, supply, leading, traits, in, the, composite, american, identity, of, the, future, as, to, our, aboriginal, or, indian, population, the, aztec, in, the, south, and, many, a, tribe, in, the, north, and, west, i, know, it, seems, to, be, agreed, that, they, must, gradually, dwindle, as, time, rolls, on, and, in, a, few, generations, more, leave, only, a, reminiscence, a, blank, but, i, am, not, at, all, clear, about, that, as, america, from, its, many, far, back, sources, and, current, supplies, develops, adapts, entwines, faithfully, identifies, its, own, are, we, to, see, it, cheerfully, accepting, and, using, all, the, contributions, of, foreign, lands, from, the, whole, outside, globe, and, then, rejecting, the, only, ones, distinctively, its, own, the, autochthonic, ones, as, to, the, spanish, stock, of, our, southwest, it, is, certain, to, me, that, we, do, not, begin, to, appreciate, the, splendor, and, sterling, value, of, its, race, element, who, knows, but, that, element, like, the, course, of, some, subterranean, river, dipping, invisibly, for, a, hundred, or, two, years, is, now, to, emerge, in, broadest, flow, and, permanent, action, whitman, has, been, claimed, as, the, first, poet, of, democracy, in, the, united, states, a, title, meant, to, reflect, his, ability, to, write, in, a, singularly, american, character, an, american, british, friend, of, whitman, mary, whitall, smith, costelloe, wrote, you, cannot, really, understand, america, without, walt, whitman, without, leaves, of, grass, he, has, expressed, that, civilization, up, to, date, as, he, would, say, and, no, student, of, the, philosophy, of, history, can, do, without, him, andrew, carnegie, called, him, the, great, poet, of, america, so, far, whitman, considered, himself, a, messiah, like, figure, in, poetry, others, agreed, one, of, his, admirers, william, sloane, kennedy, speculated, that, people, will, be, celebrating, the, birth, of, walt, whitman, as, they, are, now, the, birth, of, christ, literary, critic, harold, bloom, wrote, as, the, introduction, for, the, 150th, anniversary, of, leaves, of, grass, if, you, are, american, then, walt, whitman, is, your, imaginative, father, and, mother, even, if, like, myself, you, have, never, composed, a, line, of, verse, you, can, nominate, a, fair, number, of, literary, works, as, candidates, for, the, secular, scripture, of, the, united, states, they, might, include, melville, s, moby, dick, twain, s, adventures, of, huckleberry, finn, and, emerson, s, two, series, of, essays, and, the, conduct, of, life, none, of, those, not, even, emerson, s, are, as, central, as, the, first, edition, of, leaves, of, grass, in, his, own, time, whitman, attracted, an, influential, coterie, of, disciples, and, admirers, among, his, admirers, were, the, eagle, street, college, an, informal, group, established, in, 1885, at, the, home, of, james, william, wallace, on, eagle, street, in, bolton, england, to, read, and, discuss, the, poetry, of, whitman, the, group, subsequently, became, known, as, the, bolton, whitman, fellowship, or, whitmanites, its, members, held, an, annual, whitman, day, celebration, around, the, poet, s, birthday, whitman, is, one, of, the, most,

of, comrades, this, aligned, with, their, own, desires, for, a, future, of, brotherly, socialism, whitman, also, influenced, bram, stoker, author, of, dracula, and, was, a, model, for, the, character,
