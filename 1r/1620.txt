max, born, frs, frse, german, 11, december, 1882, 5, january, 1970, was, a, german, british, physicist, and, mathematician, who, was, instrumental, in, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, he, also, made, contributions, to, solid, state, physics, and, optics, and, supervised, the, work, of, a, number, of, notable, physicists, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, born, was, awarded, the, 1954, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, fundamental, research, in, quantum, mechanics, especially, in, the, statistical, interpretation, of, the, wave, function, born, entered, the, university, of, g, ttingen, in, 1904, where, he, met, the, three, renowned, mathematicians, felix, klein, david, hilbert, and, hermann, minkowski, he, wrote, his, phd, thesis, on, the, subject, of, stability, of, elastica, in, a, plane, and, space, winning, the, university, s, philosophy, faculty, prize, in, 1905, he, began, researching, special, relativity, with, minkowski, and, subsequently, wrote, his, habilitation, thesis, on, the, thomson, model, of, the, atom, a, chance, meeting, with, fritz, haber, in, berlin, in, 1918, led, to, discussion, of, how, an, ionic, compound, is, formed, when, a, metal, reacts, with, a, halogen, which, is, today, known, as, the, born, haber, cycle, in, world, war, i, he, was, originally, placed, as, a, radio, operator, but, his, specialist, knowledge, led, to, his, being, moved, to, research, duties, on, sound, ranging, in, 1921, born, returned, to, g, ttingen, where, he, arranged, another, chair, for, his, long, time, friend, and, colleague, james, franck, under, born, g, ttingen, became, one, of, the, world, s, foremost, centres, for, physics, in, 1925, born, and, werner, heisenberg, formulated, the, matrix, mechanics, representation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, following, year, he, formulated, the, now, standard, interpretation, of, the, probability, density, function, for, in, the, schr, dinger, equation, for, which, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, 1954, his, influence, extended, far, beyond, his, own, research, max, delbr, ck, siegfried, fl, gge, friedrich, hund, pascual, jordan, maria, goeppert, mayer, lothar, wolfgang, nordheim, robert, oppenheimer, and, victor, weisskopf, all, received, their, phd, degrees, under, born, at, g, ttingen, and, his, assistants, included, enrico, fermi, werner, heisenberg, gerhard, herzberg, friedrich, hund, wolfgang, pauli, l, on, rosenfeld, edward, teller, and, eugene, wigner, in, january, 1933, the, nazi, party, came, to, power, in, germany, and, born, who, was, jewish, was, suspended, from, his, professorship, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, he, emigrated, to, the, united, kingdom, where, he, took, a, job, at, st, john, s, college, cambridge, and, wrote, a, popular, science, book, the, restless, universe, as, well, as, atomic, physics, which, soon, became, a, standard, textbook, in, october, 1936, he, became, the, tait, professor, of, natural, philosophy, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, where, working, with, german, born, assistants, e, walter, kellermann, and, klaus, fuchs, he, continued, his, research, into, physics, born, became, a, naturalised, british, subject, on, 31, august, 1939, one, day, before, world, war, ii, broke, out, in, europe, he, remained, in, edinburgh, until, 1952, he, retired, to, bad, pyrmont, in, west, germany, and, died, in, a, hospital, in, g, ttingen, on, 5, january, 1970, max, born, was, born, on, 11, december, 1882, in, breslau, now, wroc, aw, poland, which, at, the, time, of, born, s, birth, was, part, of, the, prussian, province, of, silesia, in, the, german, empire, to, a, family, of, jewish, descent, he, was, one, of, two, children, born, to, gustav, born, an, anatomist, and, embryologist, who, was, a, professor, of, embryology, at, the, university, of, breslau, and, his, wife, margarethe, gretchen, n, e, kauffmann, from, a, silesian, family, of, industrialists, she, died, when, max, was, four, years, old, on, 29, august, 1886, max, had, a, sister, k, the, who, was, born, in, 1884, and, a, half, brother, wolfgang, from, his, father, s, second, marriage, to, bertha, lipstein, wolfgang, later, became, professor, of, art, history, at, the, city, college, of, new, york, initially, educated, at, the, k, nig, wilhelm, gymnasium, in, breslau, born, entered, the, university, of, breslau, in, 1901, the, german, university, system, allowed, students, to, move, easily, from, one, university, to, another, so, he, spent, summer, semesters, at, heidelberg, university, in, 1902, and, the, university, of, zurich, in, 1903, fellow, students, at, breslau, otto, toeplitz, and, ernst, hellinger, told, born, about, the, university, of, g, ttingen, and, born, went, there, in, april, 1904, at, g, ttingen, he, found, three, renowned, mathematicians, felix, klein, david, hilbert, and, hermann, minkowski, very, soon, after, his, arrival, born, formed, close, ties, to, the, latter, two, men, from, the, first, class, he, took, with, hilbert, hilbert, identified, born, as, having, exceptional, abilities, and, selected, him, as, the, lecture, scribe, whose, function, was, to, write, up, the, class, notes, for, the, students, mathematics, reading, room, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, being, class, scribe, put, born, into, regular, invaluable, contact, with, hilbert, hilbert, became, born, s, mentor, after, selecting, him, to, be, the, first, to, hold, the, unpaid, semi, official, position, of, assistant, born, s, introduction, to, minkowski, came, through, born, s, stepmother, bertha, as, she, knew, minkowski, from, dancing, classes, in, k, nigsberg, the, introduction, netted, born, invitations, to, the, minkowski, household, for, sunday, dinners, in, addition, while, performing, his, duties, as, scribe, and, assistant, born, often, saw, minkowski, at, hilbert, s, house, born, s, relationship, with, klein, was, more, problematic, born, attended, a, seminar, conducted, by, klein, and, professors, of, applied, mathematics, carl, runge, and, ludwig, prandtl, on, the, subject, of, elasticity, although, not, particularly, interested, in, the, subject, born, was, obliged, to, present, a, paper, he, presented, one, in, which, taking, the, simple, case, of, a, curved, wire, with, both, ends, fixed, he, used, hilbert, s, calculus, of, variations, to, determine, the, configuration, that, would, minimise, potential, energy, and, therefore, be, the, most, stable, klein, was, impressed, and, invited, born, to, submit, a, thesis, on, the, subject, of, stability, of, elastica, in, a, plane, and, space, a, subject, near, and, dear, to, klein, which, klein, had, arranged, to, be, the, subject, for, the, prestigious, annual, philosophy, faculty, prize, offered, by, the, university, entries, could, also, qualify, as, doctoral, dissertations, born, responded, by, turning, down, the, offer, as, applied, mathematics, was, not, his, preferred, area, of, study, klein, was, greatly, offended, klein, had, the, power, to, make, or, break, academic, careers, so, born, felt, compelled, to, atone, by, submitting, an, entry, for, the, prize, because, klein, refused, to, supervise, him, born, arranged, for, carl, runge, to, be, his, supervisor, woldemar, voigt, and, karl, schwarzschild, became, his, other, examiners, starting, from, his, paper, born, developed, the, equations, for, the, stability, conditions, as, he, became, more, interested, in, the, topic, he, had, an, apparatus, constructed, that, could, test, his, predictions, experimentally, on, 13, june, 1906, the, rector, announced, that, born, had, won, the, prize, a, month, later, he, passed, his, oral, examination, and, was, awarded, his, phd, in, mathematics, magna, cum, laude, on, graduation, born, was, obliged, to, perform, his, military, service, which, he, had, deferred, while, a, student, he, found, himself, drafted, into, the, german, army, and, posted, to, the, 2nd, guards, dragoons, empress, alexandra, of, russia, which, was, stationed, in, berlin, his, service, was, brief, as, he, was, discharged, early, after, an, asthma, attack, in, january, 1907, he, then, travelled, to, england, where, he, was, admitted, to, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, and, studied, physics, for, six, months, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, under, j, j, thomson, george, searle, and, joseph, larmor, after, born, returned, to, germany, the, army, re, inducted, him, and, he, served, with, the, elite, 1st, silesian, life, cuirassiers, great, elector, until, he, was, again, medically, discharged, after, just, six, weeks, service, he, then, returned, to, breslau, where, he, worked, under, the, supervision, of, otto, lummer, and, ernst, pringsheim, hoping, to, do, his, habilitation, in, physics, a, minor, accident, involving, born, s, black, body, experiment, a, ruptured, cooling, water, hose, and, a, flooded, laboratory, led, to, lummer, telling, him, that, he, would, never, become, a, physicist, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, his, paper, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, about, special, relativity, born, was, intrigued, and, began, researching, the, subject, he, was, devastated, to, discover, that, minkowski, was, also, researching, special, relativity, along, the, same, lines, but, when, he, wrote, to, minkowski, about, his, results, minkowski, asked, him, to, return, to, g, ttingen, and, do, his, habilitation, there, born, accepted, toeplitz, helped, born, brush, up, on, his, matrix, algebra, so, he, could, work, with, the, four, dimensional, minkowski, space, matrices, used, in, the, latter, s, project, to, reconcile, relativity, with, electrodynamics, born, and, minkowski, got, along, well, and, their, work, made, good, progress, but, minkowski, died, suddenly, of, appendicitis, on, 12, january, 1909, the, mathematics, students, had, born, speak, on, their, behalf, at, the, funeral, a, few, weeks, later, born, attempted, to, present, their, results, at, a, meeting, of, the, g, ttingen, mathematics, society, he, did, not, get, far, before, he, was, publicly, challenged, by, klein, and, max, abraham, who, rejected, relativity, forcing, him, to, terminate, the, lecture, however, hilbert, and, runge, were, interested, in, born, s, work, and, after, some, discussion, with, born, they, became, convinced, of, the, veracity, of, his, results, and, persuaded, him, to, give, the, lecture, again, this, time, he, was, not, interrupted, and, voigt, offered, to, sponsor, born, s, habilitation, thesis, born, subsequently, published, his, talk, as, an, article, on, the, theory, of, the, rigid, electron, in, the, kinematics, of, the, principle, of, relativity, german, die, theorie, des, starren, elektrons, in, der, kinematik, des, relativit, tsprinzips, which, introduced, the, concept, of, born, rigidity, on, 23, october, born, presented, his, habilitation, lecture, on, the, thomson, model, of, the, atom, born, settled, in, as, a, young, academic, at, g, ttingen, as, a, privatdozent, in, g, ttingen, born, stayed, at, a, boarding, house, run, by, sister, annie, at, dahlmannstra, e, 17, known, as, el, bokarebo, the, name, was, derived, from, the, first, letters, of, the, last, names, of, its, boarders, el, for, ella, philipson, a, medical, student, bo, for, born, and, hans, bolza, a, physics, student, ka, for, theodore, von, k, rm, n, a, privatdozent, and, re, for, albrecht, renner, another, medical, student, a, frequent, visitor, to, the, boarding, house, was, paul, peter, ewald, a, doctoral, student, of, arnold, sommerfeld, on, loan, to, hilbert, at, g, ttingen, as, a, special, assistant, for, physics, richard, courant, a, mathematician, and, privatdozent, called, these, people, the, in, group, in, 1912, born, met, hedwig, hedi, ehrenberg, the, daughter, of, a, leipzig, university, law, professor, and, a, friend, of, carl, runge, s, daughter, iris, she, was, of, jewish, background, on, her, father, s, side, although, he, had, become, a, practising, lutheran, when, he, got, married, as, did, max, s, sister, k, the, despite, never, practising, his, religion, born, refused, to, convert, and, his, wedding, on, 2, august, 1913, was, a, garden, ceremony, however, he, was, baptised, as, a, lutheran, in, march, 1914, by, the, same, pastor, who, had, performed, his, wedding, ceremony, born, regarded, religious, professions, and, churches, as, a, matter, of, no, importance, his, decision, to, be, baptised, was, made, partly, in, deference, to, his, wife, and, partly, due, to, his, desire, to, assimilate, into, german, society, the, marriage, produced, three, children, two, daughters, irene, born, in, 1914, and, margarethe, gritli, born, in, 1915, and, a, son, gustav, born, in, 1921, through, marriage, born, is, related, to, jurists, victor, ehrenberg, his, father, in, law, and, rudolf, von, jhering, his, wife, s, maternal, grandfather, as, well, as, to, philosopher, and, theologian, hans, ehrenberg, and, is, a, great, uncle, of, british, comedian, ben, elton, by, the, end, of, 1913, born, had, published, 27, papers, including, important, work, on, relativity, and, the, dynamics, of, crystal, lattices, 3, with, theodore, von, karman, which, became, a, book, in, 1914, he, received, a, letter, from, max, planck, explaining, that, a, new, professor, extraordinarius, chair, of, theoretical, physics, had, been, created, at, the, university, of, berlin, the, chair, had, been, offered, to, max, von, laue, but, he, had, turned, it, down, born, accepted, the, first, world, war, was, now, raging, soon, after, arriving, in, berlin, in, 1915, he, enlisted, in, an, army, signals, unit, in, october, he, joined, the, artillerie, pr, fungskommission, the, army, s, berlin, based, artillery, research, and, development, organisation, under, rudolf, ladenburg, who, had, established, a, special, unit, dedicated, to, the, new, technology, of, sound, ranging, in, berlin, born, formed, a, lifelong, friendship, with, einstein, who, became, a, frequent, visitor, to, born, s, home, within, days, of, the, armistice, in, november, 1918, planck, had, the, army, release, born, a, chance, meeting, with, fritz, haber, that, month, led, to, discussion, of, the, manner, in, which, an, ionic, compound, is, formed, when, a, metal, reacts, with, a, halogen, which, is, today, known, as, the, born, haber, cycle, even, before, born, had, taken, up, the, chair, in, berlin, von, laue, had, changed, his, mind, and, decided, that, he, wanted, it, after, all, he, arranged, with, born, and, the, faculties, concerned, for, them, to, exchange, jobs, in, april, 1919, born, became, professor, ordinarius, and, director, of, the, institute, of, theoretical, physics, on, the, science, faculty, at, the, university, of, frankfurt, am, main, while, there, he, was, approached, by, the, university, of, g, ttingen, which, was, looking, for, a, replacement, for, peter, debye, as, director, of, the, physical, institute, theoretical, physics, einstein, advised, him, will, flourish, wherever, you, happen, to, be, there, is, no, other, born, to, be, found, in, germany, today, in, negotiating, for, the, position, with, the, education, ministry, born, arranged, for, another, chair, of, experimental, physics, at, g, ttingen, for, his, long, time, friend, and, colleague, james, franck, in, 1919, elisabeth, bormann, joined, the, institut, f, r, theoretische, physik, as, his, assistant, she, developed, the, first, atomic, beams, working, with, born, bormann, was, the, first, to, measure, the, free, path, of, atoms, in, gases, and, the, size, of, molecules, for, the, 12, years, born, and, franck, were, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, 1921, to, 1933, born, had, a, collaborator, with, shared, views, on, basic, scientific, concepts, a, benefit, for, teaching, and, research, born, s, collaborative, approach, with, experimental, physicists, was, similar, to, that, of, arnold, sommerfeld, at, the, university, of, munich, who, was, ordinarius, professor, of, theoretical, physics, and, director, of, the, institute, of, theoretical, physics, also, a, prime, mover, in, the, development, of, quantum, theory, born, and, sommerfeld, collaborated, with, experimental, physicists, to, test, and, advance, their, theories, in, 1922, when, lecturing, in, the, united, states, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, sommerfeld, sent, his, student, werner, heisenberg, to, be, born, s, assistant, heisenberg, returned, to, g, ttingen, in, 1923, where, he, completed, his, habilitation, under, born, in, 1924, and, became, a, privatdozent, at, g, ttingen, in, 1919, and, 1920, max, born, became, displeased, about, the, large, number, of, objections, against, einstein, s, relativity, and, gave, speeches, in, the, winter, of, 1919, in, support, of, einstein, born, received, pay, for, his, relativity, speeches, which, helped, with, expenses, through, the, year, of, rapid, inflation, the, speeches, in, german, language, became, a, book, published, in, 1920, of, which, einstein, received, the, proofs, before, publication, a, third, edition, was, published, in, 1922, and, an, english, translation, was, published, in, 1924, born, represented, light, speed, as, a, function, of, curvature, the, velocity, of, light, is, much, greater, for, some, directions, of, the, light, ray, than, its, ordinary, value, c, and, other, bodies, can, also, attain, much, greater, velocities, in, 1925, born, and, heisenberg, formulated, the, matrix, mechanics, representation, of, quantum, mechanics, on, 9, july, heisenberg, gave, born, a, paper, entitled, ber, quantentheoretische, umdeutung, kinematischer, und, mechanischer, beziehungen, quantum, theoretical, re, interpretation, of, kinematic, and, mechanical, relations, to, review, and, submit, for, publication, in, the, paper, heisenberg, formulated, quantum, theory, avoiding, the, concrete, but, unobservable, representations, of, electron, orbits, by, using, parameters, such, as, transition, probabilities, for, quantum, jumps, which, necessitated, using, two, indexes, corresponding, to, the, initial, and, final, states, when, born, read, the, paper, he, recognized, the, formulation, as, one, which, could, be, transcribed, and, extended, to, the, systematic, language, of, matrices, which, he, had, learned, from, his, study, under, jakob, rosanes, at, breslau, university, up, until, this, time, matrices, were, seldom, used, by, physicists, they, were, considered, to, belong, to, the, realm, of, pure, mathematics, gustav, mie, had, used, them, in, a, paper, on, electrodynamics, in, 1912, and, born, had, used, them, in, his, work, on, the, lattices, theory, of, crystals, in, 1921, while, matrices, were, used, in, these, cases, the, algebra, of, matrices, with, their, multiplication, did, not, enter, the, picture, as, they, did, in, the, matrix, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, with, the, help, of, his, assistant, and, former, student, pascual, jordan, born, began, immediately, to, make, a, transcription, and, extension, and, they, submitted, their, results, for, publication, the, paper, was, received, for, publication, just, 60, days, after, heisenberg, s, paper, a, follow, on, paper, was, submitted, for, publication, before, the, end, of, the, year, by, all, three, authors, the, result, was, a, surprising, formulation, where, p, and, q, were, matrices, for, location, and, momentum, and, i, is, the, identity, matrix, the, left, hand, side, of, the, equation, is, not, zero, because, matrix, multiplication, is, not, commutative, this, formulation, was, entirely, attributable, to, born, who, also, established, that, all, the, elements, not, on, the, diagonal, of, the, matrix, were, zero, born, considered, that, his, paper, with, jordan, contained, the, most, important, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, including, its, extension, to, electrodynamics, the, paper, put, heisenberg, s, approach, on, a, solid, mathematical, basis, born, was, surprised, to, discover, that, paul, dirac, had, been, thinking, along, the, same, lines, as, heisenberg, soon, wolfgang, pauli, used, the, matrix, method, to, calculate, the, energy, values, of, the, hydrogen, atom, and, found, that, they, agreed, with, the, bohr, model, another, important, contribution, was, made, by, erwin, schr, dinger, who, looked, at, the, problem, using, wave, mechanics, this, had, a, great, deal, of, appeal, to, many, at, the, time, as, it, offered, the, possibility, of, returning, to, deterministic, classical, physics, born, would, have, none, of, this, as, it, ran, counter, to, facts, determined, by, experiment, he, formulated, the, now, standard, interpretation, of, the, probability, density, function, for, in, the, schr, dinger, equation, which, he, published, in, july, 1926, in, a, letter, to, born, on, 4, december, 1926, einstein, made, his, famous, remark, regarding, quantum, mechanics, quantum, mechanics, is, certainly, imposing, but, an, inner, voice, tells, me, that, it, is, not, yet, the, real, thing, the, theory, says, a, lot, but, does, not, really, bring, us, any, closer, to, the, secret, of, the, old, one, i, at, any, rate, am, convinced, that, he, is, not, playing, at, dice, this, quotation, is, often, paraphrased, as, god, does, not, play, dice, in, 1928, einstein, nominated, heisenberg, born, and, jordan, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, but, heisenberg, alone, won, the, 1932, prize, for, the, creation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, application, of, which, has, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, allotropic, forms, of, hydrogen, while, schr, dinger, and, dirac, shared, the, 1933, prize, for, the, discovery, of, new, productive, forms, of, atomic, theory, on, 25, november, 1933, born, received, a, letter, from, heisenberg, in, which, he, said, he, had, been, delayed, in, writing, due, to, a, bad, conscience, that, he, alone, had, received, the, prize, for, work, done, in, g, ttingen, in, collaboration, you, jordan, and, i, heisenberg, went, on, to, say, that, born, and, jordan, s, contribution, to, quantum, mechanics, cannot, be, changed, by, a, wrong, decision, from, the, outside, in, 1954, heisenberg, wrote, an, article, honouring, planck, for, his, insight, in, 1900, in, which, he, credited, born, and, jordan, for, the, final, mathematical, formulation, of, matrix, mechanics, and, heisenberg, went, on, to, stress, how, great, their, contributions, were, to, quantum, mechanics, which, were, not, adequately, acknowledged, in, the, public, eye, those, who, received, their, phd, degrees, under, born, at, g, ttingen, included, max, delbr, ck, siegfried, fl, gge, friedrich, hund, pascual, jordan, maria, goeppert, mayer, lothar, wolfgang, nordheim, robert, oppenheimer, and, victor, weisskopf, born, s, assistants, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, s, institute, for, theoretical, physics, included, enrico, fermi, werner, heisenberg, gerhard, herzberg, friedrich, hund, pascual, jordan, wolfgang, pauli, l, on, rosenfeld, edward, teller, and, eugene, wigner, walter, heitler, became, an, assistant, to, born, in, 1928, and, completed, his, habilitation, under, him, in, 1929, born, not, only, recognised, talent, to, work, with, him, but, he, let, his, superstars, stretch, past, him, to, those, less, gifted, he, patiently, handed, out, respectable, but, doable, assignments, delbr, ck, and, goeppert, mayer, went, on, to, be, awarded, nobel, prizes, in, january, 1933, the, nazi, party, came, to, power, in, germany, in, may, born, became, one, of, six, jewish, professors, at, g, ttingen, who, were, suspended, with, pay, franck, had, already, resigned, in, twelve, years, they, had, built, g, ttingen, into, one, of, the, world, s, foremost, centres, for, physics, born, began, looking, for, a, new, job, writing, to, maria, g, ppert, mayer, at, johns, hopkins, university, and, rudi, ladenburg, at, princeton, university, he, accepted, an, offer, from, st, john, s, college, cambridge, at, cambridge, he, wrote, a, popular, science, book, the, restless, universe, and, a, textbook, atomic, physics, that, soon, became, a, standard, text, going, through, seven, editions, his, family, soon, settled, into, life, in, england, with, his, daughters, irene, and, gritli, becoming, engaged, to, welshman, brinley, bryn, newton, john, and, englishman, maurice, pryce, respectively, born, s, granddaughter, olivia, newton, john, was, the, daughter, of, irene, born, s, position, at, cambridge, was, only, a, temporary, one, and, his, tenure, at, g, ttingen, was, terminated, in, may, 1935,
