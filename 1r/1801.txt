david, hilbert, h, l, b, r, t, german, 23, january, 1862, 14, february, 1943, was, a, german, mathematician, and, philosopher, of, mathematics, and, one, of, the, most, influential, mathematicians, of, his, time, hilbert, discovered, and, developed, a, broad, range, of, fundamental, ideas, including, invariant, theory, the, calculus, of, variations, commutative, algebra, algebraic, number, theory, the, foundations, of, geometry, spectral, theory, of, operators, and, its, application, to, integral, equations, mathematical, physics, and, the, foundations, of, mathematics, particularly, proof, theory, he, adopted, and, defended, georg, cantor, s, set, theory, and, transfinite, numbers, in, 1900, he, presented, a, collection, of, problems, that, set, a, course, for, mathematical, research, of, the, 20th, century, hilbert, and, his, students, contributed, to, establishing, rigor, and, developed, important, tools, used, in, modern, mathematical, physics, he, was, a, cofounder, of, proof, theory, and, mathematical, logic, hilbert, the, first, of, two, children, and, only, son, of, otto, a, county, judge, and, maria, therese, hilbert, n, e, erdtmann, the, daughter, of, a, merchant, was, born, in, the, province, of, prussia, kingdom, of, prussia, either, in, k, nigsberg, according, to, hilbert, s, own, statement, or, in, wehlau, known, since, 1946, as, znamensk, near, k, nigsberg, where, his, father, worked, at, the, time, of, his, birth, his, paternal, grandfather, was, david, hilbert, a, judge, and, geheimrat, his, mother, maria, had, an, interest, in, philosophy, astronomy, and, prime, numbers, while, his, father, otto, taught, him, prussian, virtues, after, his, father, became, a, city, judge, the, family, moved, to, k, nigsberg, david, s, sister, elise, was, born, when, he, was, six, he, began, his, schooling, aged, eight, two, years, later, than, the, usual, starting, age, in, late, 1872, hilbert, entered, the, friedrichskolleg, gymnasium, collegium, fridericianum, the, same, school, that, immanuel, kant, had, attended, 140, years, before, but, after, an, unhappy, period, he, transferred, to, late, 1879, and, graduated, from, early, 1880, the, more, science, oriented, wilhelm, gymnasium, upon, graduation, in, autumn, 1880, hilbert, enrolled, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, the, albertina, in, early, 1882, hermann, minkowski, two, years, younger, than, hilbert, and, also, a, native, of, k, nigsberg, but, had, gone, to, berlin, for, three, semesters, returned, to, k, nigsberg, and, entered, the, university, hilbert, developed, a, lifelong, friendship, with, the, shy, gifted, minkowski, in, 1884, adolf, hurwitz, arrived, from, g, ttingen, as, an, extraordinarius, i, e, an, associate, professor, an, intense, and, fruitful, scientific, exchange, among, the, three, began, and, minkowski, and, hilbert, especially, would, exercise, a, reciprocal, influence, over, each, other, at, various, times, in, their, scientific, careers, hilbert, obtained, his, doctorate, in, 1885, with, a, dissertation, written, under, ferdinand, von, lindemann, titled, ber, invariante, eigenschaften, spezieller, bin, rer, formen, insbesondere, der, kugelfunktionen, on, the, invariant, properties, of, special, binary, forms, in, particular, the, spherical, harmonic, functions, hilbert, remained, at, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, as, a, privatdozent, senior, lecturer, from, 1886, to, 1895, in, 1895, as, a, result, of, intervention, on, his, behalf, by, felix, klein, he, obtained, the, position, of, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, during, the, klein, and, hilbert, years, g, ttingen, became, the, preeminent, institution, in, the, mathematical, world, he, remained, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, among, hilbert, s, students, were, hermann, weyl, chess, champion, emanuel, lasker, ernst, zermelo, and, carl, gustav, hempel, john, von, neumann, was, his, assistant, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, hilbert, was, surrounded, by, a, social, circle, of, some, of, the, most, important, mathematicians, of, the, 20th, century, such, as, emmy, noether, and, alonzo, church, among, his, 69, ph, d, students, in, g, ttingen, were, many, who, later, became, famous, mathematicians, including, with, date, of, thesis, otto, blumenthal, 1898, felix, bernstein, 1901, hermann, weyl, 1908, richard, courant, 1910, erich, hecke, 1910, hugo, steinhaus, 1911, and, wilhelm, ackermann, 1925, between, 1902, and, 1939, hilbert, was, editor, of, the, mathematische, annalen, the, leading, mathematical, journal, of, the, time, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1907, in, 1892, hilbert, married, k, the, jerosch, 1864, 1945, who, was, the, daughter, of, a, k, nigsberg, merchant, an, outspoken, young, lady, with, an, independence, of, mind, that, matched, while, at, k, nigsberg, they, had, their, one, child, franz, hilbert, 1893, 1969, franz, suffered, throughout, his, life, from, mental, illness, and, after, he, was, admitted, into, a, psychiatric, clinic, hilbert, said, from, now, on, i, must, consider, myself, as, not, having, a, son, his, attitude, toward, franz, brought, k, the, considerable, sorrow, hilbert, considered, the, mathematician, hermann, minkowski, to, be, his, best, and, truest, friend, hilbert, was, baptized, and, raised, a, calvinist, in, the, prussian, evangelical, church, he, later, left, the, church, and, became, an, agnostic, he, also, argued, that, mathematical, truth, was, independent, of, the, existence, of, god, or, other, a, priori, assumptions, when, galileo, galilei, was, criticized, for, failing, to, stand, up, for, his, convictions, on, the, heliocentric, theory, hilbert, objected, but, was, not, an, idiot, only, an, idiot, could, believe, that, scientific, truth, needs, martyrdom, that, may, be, necessary, in, religion, but, scientific, results, prove, themselves, in, due, time, like, albert, einstein, hilbert, had, closest, contacts, with, the, berlin, group, whose, leading, founders, had, studied, under, hilbert, in, g, ttingen, kurt, grelling, hans, reichenbach, and, walter, dubislav, around, 1925, hilbert, developed, pernicious, anemia, a, then, untreatable, vitamin, deficiency, whose, primary, symptom, is, exhaustion, his, assistant, eugene, wigner, described, him, as, subject, to, enormous, fatigue, and, how, he, seemed, quite, old, and, that, even, after, eventually, being, diagnosed, and, treated, he, was, hardly, a, scientist, after, 1925, and, certainly, not, a, hilbert, hilbert, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1932, hilbert, lived, to, see, the, nazis, purge, many, of, the, prominent, faculty, members, at, university, of, g, ttingen, in, 1933, those, forced, out, included, hermann, weyl, who, had, taken, hilbert, s, chair, when, he, retired, in, 1930, emmy, noether, and, edmund, landau, one, who, had, to, leave, germany, paul, bernays, had, collaborated, with, hilbert, in, mathematical, logic, and, co, authored, with, him, the, important, book, grundlagen, der, mathematik, which, eventually, appeared, in, two, volumes, in, 1934, and, 1939, this, was, a, sequel, to, the, hilbert, ackermann, book, principles, of, mathematical, logic, from, 1928, hermann, weyl, s, successor, was, helmut, hasse, about, a, year, later, hilbert, attended, a, banquet, and, was, seated, next, to, the, new, minister, of, education, bernhard, rust, rust, asked, whether, the, mathematical, institute, really, suffered, so, much, because, of, the, departure, of, the, jews, hilbert, replied, suffered, it, doesn, t, exist, any, longer, does, it, by, the, time, hilbert, died, in, 1943, the, nazis, had, nearly, completely, restaffed, the, university, as, many, of, the, former, faculty, had, either, been, jewish, or, married, to, jews, hilbert, s, funeral, was, attended, by, fewer, than, a, dozen, people, only, two, of, whom, were, fellow, academics, among, them, arnold, sommerfeld, a, theoretical, physicist, and, also, a, native, of, k, nigsberg, news, of, his, death, only, became, known, to, the, wider, world, several, months, after, he, died, the, epitaph, on, his, tombstone, in, g, ttingen, consists, of, the, famous, lines, he, spoke, at, the, conclusion, of, his, retirement, address, to, the, society, of, german, scientists, and, physicians, on, 8, september, 1930, the, words, were, given, in, response, to, the, latin, maxim, ignoramus, et, ignorabimus, or, we, do, not, know, and, we, shall, not, know, wir, m, ssen, wissen, wir, werden, wissen, we, must, know, we, shall, know, the, day, before, hilbert, pronounced, these, phrases, at, the, 1930, annual, meeting, of, the, society, of, german, scientists, and, physicians, kurt, g, del, in, a, round, table, discussion, during, the, conference, on, epistemology, held, jointly, with, the, society, meetings, tentatively, announced, the, first, expression, of, his, incompleteness, theorem, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, show, that, even, elementary, axiomatic, systems, such, as, peano, arithmetic, are, either, self, contradicting, or, contain, logical, propositions, that, are, impossible, to, prove, or, disprove, within, that, system, hilbert, s, first, work, on, invariant, functions, led, him, to, the, demonstration, in, 1888, of, his, famous, finiteness, theorem, twenty, years, earlier, paul, gordan, had, demonstrated, the, theorem, of, the, finiteness, of, generators, for, binary, forms, using, a, complex, computational, approach, attempts, to, generalize, his, method, to, functions, with, more, than, two, variables, failed, because, of, the, enormous, difficulty, of, the, calculations, involved, to, solve, what, had, become, known, in, some, circles, as, gordan, s, problem, hilbert, realized, that, it, was, necessary, to, take, a, completely, different, path, as, a, result, he, demonstrated, hilbert, s, basis, theorem, showing, the, existence, of, a, finite, set, of, generators, for, the, invariants, of, quantics, in, any, number, of, variables, but, in, an, abstract, form, that, is, while, demonstrating, the, existence, of, such, a, set, it, was, not, a, constructive, proof, it, did, not, display, an, object, but, rather, it, was, an, existence, proof, and, relied, on, use, of, the, law, of, excluded, middle, in, an, infinite, extension, hilbert, sent, his, results, to, the, mathematische, annalen, gordan, the, house, expert, on, the, theory, of, invariants, for, the, mathematische, annalen, could, not, appreciate, the, revolutionary, nature, of, hilbert, s, theorem, and, rejected, the, article, criticizing, the, exposition, because, it, was, insufficiently, comprehensive, his, comment, was, das, ist, nicht, mathematik, das, ist, theologie, this, is, not, mathematics, this, is, theology, klein, on, the, other, hand, recognized, the, importance, of, the, work, and, guaranteed, that, it, would, be, published, without, any, alterations, encouraged, by, klein, hilbert, extended, his, method, in, a, second, article, providing, estimations, on, the, maximum, degree, of, the, minimum, set, of, generators, and, he, sent, it, once, more, to, the, annalen, after, having, read, the, manuscript, klein, wrote, to, him, saying, without, doubt, this, is, the, most, important, work, on, general, algebra, that, the, annalen, has, ever, published, later, after, the, usefulness, of, hilbert, s, method, was, universally, recognized, gordan, himself, would, say, i, have, convinced, myself, that, even, theology, has, its, merits, for, all, his, successes, the, nature, of, his, proof, created, more, trouble, than, hilbert, could, have, imagined, although, kronecker, had, conceded, hilbert, would, later, respond, to, others, similar, criticisms, that, many, different, constructions, are, subsumed, under, one, fundamental, idea, in, other, words, to, quote, reid, through, a, proof, of, existence, hilbert, had, been, able, to, obtain, a, construction, the, proof, i, e, the, symbols, on, the, page, was, the, object, not, all, were, convinced, while, kronecker, would, die, soon, afterwards, his, constructivist, philosophy, would, continue, with, the, young, brouwer, and, his, developing, intuitionist, school, much, to, hilbert, s, torment, in, his, later, years, indeed, hilbert, would, lose, his, gifted, pupil, weyl, to, intuitionism, hilbert, was, disturbed, by, his, former, student, s, fascination, with, the, ideas, of, brouwer, which, aroused, in, hilbert, the, memory, of, kronecker, brouwer, the, intuitionist, in, particular, opposed, the, use, of, the, law, of, excluded, middle, over, infinite, sets, as, hilbert, had, used, it, hilbert, responded, taking, the, principle, of, the, excluded, middle, from, the, mathematician, is, the, same, as, prohibiting, the, boxer, the, use, of, his, fists, in, 1890, giuseppe, peano, had, published, an, article, in, the, mathematische, annalen, describing, the, historically, first, space, filling, curve, in, response, hilbert, designed, his, own, construction, of, such, a, curve, which, is, now, called, hilbert, curve, approximations, to, this, curve, are, constructed, iteratively, according, to, the, replacement, rules, in, the, first, picture, of, this, section, the, curve, itself, is, then, the, pointwise, limit, the, text, grundlagen, der, geometrie, tr, foundations, of, geometry, published, by, hilbert, in, 1899, proposes, a, formal, set, called, hilbert, s, axioms, substituting, for, the, traditional, axioms, of, euclid, they, avoid, weaknesses, identified, in, those, of, euclid, whose, works, at, the, time, were, still, used, textbook, fashion, it, is, difficult, to, specify, the, axioms, used, by, hilbert, without, referring, to, the, publication, history, of, the, grundlagen, since, hilbert, changed, and, modified, them, several, times, the, original, monograph, was, quickly, followed, by, a, french, translation, in, which, hilbert, added, v, 2, the, completeness, axiom, an, english, translation, authorized, by, hilbert, was, made, by, e, j, townsend, and, copyrighted, in, 1902, this, translation, incorporated, the, changes, made, in, the, french, translation, and, so, is, considered, to, be, a, translation, of, the, 2nd, edition, hilbert, continued, to, make, changes, in, the, text, and, several, editions, appeared, in, german, the, 7th, edition, was, the, last, to, appear, in, hilbert, s, lifetime, new, editions, followed, the, 7th, but, the, main, text, was, essentially, not, revised, hilbert, s, approach, signaled, the, shift, to, the, modern, axiomatic, method, in, this, hilbert, was, anticipated, by, moritz, pasch, s, work, from, 1882, axioms, are, not, taken, as, self, evident, truths, geometry, may, treat, things, about, which, we, have, powerful, intuitions, but, it, is, not, necessary, to, assign, any, explicit, meaning, to, the, undefined, concepts, the, elements, such, as, point, line, plane, and, others, could, be, substituted, as, hilbert, is, reported, to, have, said, to, schoenflies, and, k, tter, by, tables, chairs, glasses, of, beer, and, other, such, objects, it, is, their, defined, relationships, that, are, discussed, hilbert, first, enumerates, the, undefined, concepts, point, line, plane, lying, on, a, relation, between, points, and, lines, points, and, planes, and, lines, and, planes, betweenness, congruence, of, pairs, of, points, line, segments, and, congruence, of, angles, the, axioms, unify, both, the, plane, geometry, and, solid, geometry, of, euclid, in, a, single, system, hilbert, put, forth, a, highly, influential, list, consisting, of, 23, unsolved, problems, at, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, in, paris, in, 1900, this, is, generally, reckoned, as, the, most, successful, and, deeply, considered, compilation, of, open, problems, ever, to, be, produced, by, an, individual, mathematician, after, reworking, the, foundations, of, classical, geometry, hilbert, could, have, extrapolated, to, the, rest, of, mathematics, his, approach, differed, from, the, later, foundationalist, russell, whitehead, or, encyclopedist, nicolas, bourbaki, and, from, his, contemporary, giuseppe, peano, the, mathematical, community, as, a, whole, could, engage, in, problems, of, which, he, had, identified, as, crucial, aspects, of, important, areas, of, mathematics, the, problem, set, was, launched, as, a, talk, the, problems, of, mathematics, presented, during, the, course, of, the, second, international, congress, of, mathematicians, held, in, paris, the, introduction, of, the, speech, that, hilbert, gave, said, who, among, us, would, not, be, happy, to, lift, the, veil, behind, which, is, hidden, the, future, to, gaze, at, the, coming, developments, of, our, science, and, at, the, secrets, of, its, development, in, the, centuries, to, come, what, will, be, the, ends, toward, which, the, spirit, of, future, generations, of, mathematicians, will, tend, what, methods, what, new, facts, will, the, new, century, reveal, in, the, vast, and, rich, field, of, mathematical, thought, he, presented, fewer, than, half, the, problems, at, the, congress, which, were, published, in, the, acts, of, the, congress, in, a, subsequent, publication, he, extended, the, panorama, and, arrived, at, the, formulation, of, the, now, canonical, 23, problems, of, hilbert, see, also, hilbert, s, twenty, fourth, problem, the, full, text, is, important, since, the, exegesis, of, the, questions, still, can, be, a, matter, of, inevitable, debate, whenever, it, is, asked, how, many, have, been, solved, some, of, these, were, solved, within, a, short, time, others, have, been, discussed, throughout, the, 20th, century, with, a, few, now, taken, to, be, unsuitably, open, ended, to, come, to, closure, some, continue, to, remain, challenges, the, following, are, the, headers, for, hilbert, s, 23, problems, as, they, appeared, in, the, 1902, translation, in, the, bulletin, of, the, american, mathematical, society, in, an, account, that, had, become, standard, by, the, mid, century, hilbert, s, problem, set, was, also, a, kind, of, manifesto, that, opened, the, way, for, the, development, of, the, formalist, school, one, of, three, major, schools, of, mathematics, of, the, 20th, century, according, to, the, formalist, mathematics, is, manipulation, of, symbols, according, to, agreed, upon, formal, rules, it, is, therefore, an, autonomous, activity, of, thought, in, 1920, hilbert, proposed, a, research, project, in, metamathematics, that, became, known, as, hilbert, s, program, he, wanted, mathematics, to, be, formulated, on, a, solid, and, complete, logical, foundation, he, believed, that, in, principle, this, could, be, done, by, showing, that, he, seems, to, have, had, both, technical, and, philosophical, reasons, for, formulating, this, proposal, it, affirmed, his, dislike, of, what, had, become, known, as, the, ignorabimus, still, an, active, issue, in, his, time, in, german, thought, and, traced, back, in, that, formulation, to, emil, du, bois, reymond, this, program, is, still, recognizable, in, the, most, popular, philosophy, of, mathematics, where, it, is, usually, called, formalism, for, example, the, bourbaki, group, adopted, a, watered, down, and, selective, version, of, it, as, adequate, to, the, requirements, of, their, twin, projects, of, a, writing, encyclopedic, foundational, works, and, b, supporting, the, axiomatic, method, as, a, research, tool, this, approach, has, been, successful, and, influential, in, relation, with, hilbert, s, work, in, algebra, and, functional, analysis, but, has, failed, to, engage, in, the, same, way, with, his, interests, in, physics, and, logic, hilbert, wrote, in, 1919, we, are, not, speaking, here, of, arbitrariness, in, any, sense, mathematics, is, not, like, a, game, whose, tasks, are, determined, by, arbitrarily, stipulated, rules, rather, it, is, a, conceptual, system, possessing, internal, necessity, that, can, only, be, so, and, by, no, means, otherwise, hilbert, published, his, views, on, the, foundations, of, mathematics, in, the, 2, volume, work, grundlagen, der, mathematik, hilbert, and, the, mathematicians, who, worked, with, him, in, his, enterprise, were, committed, to, the, project, his, attempt, to, support, axiomatized, mathematics, with, definitive, principles, which, could, banish, theoretical, uncertainties, ended, in, failure, g, del, demonstrated, that, any, non, contradictory, formal, system, which, was, comprehensive, enough, to, include, at, least, arithmetic, cannot, demonstrate, its, completeness, by, way, of, its, own, axioms, in, 1931, his, incompleteness, theorem, showed, that, hilbert, s, grand, plan, was, impossible, as, stated, the, second, point, cannot, in, any, reasonable, way, be, combined, with, the, first, point, as, long, as, the, axiom, system, is, genuinely, finitary, nevertheless, the, subsequent, achievements, of, proof, theory, at, the, very, least, clarified, consistency, as, it, relates, to, theories, of, central, concern, to, mathematicians, hilbert, s, work, had, started, logic, on, this, course, of, clarification, the, need, to, understand, g, del, s, work, then, led, to, the, development, of, recursion, theory, and, then, mathematical, logic, as, an, autonomous, discipline, in, the, 1930s, the, basis, for, later, theoretical, computer, science, in, the, work, of, alonzo, church, and, alan, turing, also, grew, directly, out, of, this, debate, around, 1909, hilbert, dedicated, himself, to, the, study, of, differential, and, integral, equations, his, work, had, direct, consequences, for, important, parts, of, modern, functional, analysis, in, order, to, carry, out, these, studies, hilbert, introduced, the, concept, of, an, infinite, dimensional, euclidean, space, later, called, hilbert, space, his, work, in, this, part, of, analysis, provided, the, basis, for, important, contributions, to, the, mathematics, of, physics, in, the, next, two, decades, though, from, an, unanticipated, direction, later, on, stefan, banach, amplified, the, concept, defining, banach, spaces, hilbert, spaces, are, an, important, class, of, objects, in, the, area, of, functional, analysis, particularly, of, the, spectral, theory, of, self, adjoint, linear, operators, that, grew, up, around, it, during, the, 20th, century, until, 1912, hilbert, was, almost, exclusively, a, pure, mathematician, when, planning, a, visit, from, bonn, where, he, was, immersed, in, studying, physics, his, fellow, mathematician, and, friend, hermann, minkowski, joked, he, had, to, spend, 10, days, in, quarantine, before, being, able, to, visit, hilbert, in, fact, minkowski, seems, responsible, for, most, of, hilbert, s, physics, investigations, prior, to, 1912, including, their, joint, seminar, on, the, subject, in, 1905, in, 1912, three, years, after, his, friend, s, death, hilbert, turned, his, focus, to, the, subject, almost, exclusively, he, arranged, to, have, a, physics, tutor, for, himself, he, started, studying, kinetic, gas, theory, and, moved, on, to, elementary, radiation, theory, and, the, molecular, theory, of, matter, even, after, the, war, started, in, 1914, he, continued, seminars, and, classes, where, the, works, of, albert, einstein, and, others, were, followed, closely, by, 1907, einstein, had, framed, the, fundamentals, of, the, theory, of, gravity, but, then, struggled, for, nearly, 8, years, to, put, the, theory, into, its, final, form, by, early, summer, 1915, hilbert, s, interest, in, physics, had, focused, on, general, relativity, and, he, invited, einstein, to, g, ttingen, to, deliver, a, week, of, lectures, on, the, subject, einstein, received, an, enthusiastic, reception, at, g, ttingen, over, the, summer, einstein, learned, that, hilbert, was, also, working, on, the, field, equations, and, redoubled, his, own, efforts, during, november, 1915, einstein, published, several, papers, culminating, in, the, field, equations, of, gravitation, see, einstein, field, equations, nearly, simultaneously, hilbert, published, the, foundations, of, physics, an, axiomatic, derivation, of, the, field, equations, see, einstein, hilbert, action, hilbert, fully, credited, einstein, as, the, originator, of, the, theory, and, no, public, priority, dispute, concerning, the, field, equations, ever, arose, between, the, two, men, during, their, lives, see, more, at, priority, additionally, hilbert, s, work, anticipated, and, assisted, several, advances, in, the, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, his, work, was, a, key, aspect, of, hermann, weyl, and, john, von, neumann, s, work, on, the, mathematical, equivalence, of, werner, heisenberg, s, matrix, mechanics, and, erwin, schr, dinger, s, wave, equation, and, his, namesake, hilbert, space, plays, an, important, part, in, quantum, theory, in, 1926, von, neumann, showed, that, if, quantum, states, were, understood, as, vectors, in, hilbert, space, they, would, correspond, with, both, schr, dinger, s, wave, function, theory, and, heisenberg, s, matrices, throughout, this, immersion, in, physics, hilbert, worked, on, putting, rigor, into, the, mathematics, of, physics, while, highly, dependent, on, higher, mathematics, physicists, tended, to, be, sloppy, with, it, to, a, pure, mathematician, like, hilbert, this, was, both, ugly, and, difficult, to, understand, as, he, began, to, understand, physics, and, how, physicists, were, using, mathematics, he, developed, a, coherent, mathematical, theory, for, what, he, found, most, importantly, in, the, area, of, integral, equations, when, his, colleague, richard, courant, wrote, the, now, classic, methoden, der, mathematischen, physik, methods, of, mathematical, physics, including, some, of, hilbert, s, ideas, he, added, hilbert, s, name, as, author, even, though, hilbert, had, not, directly, contributed, to, the, writing, hilbert, said, physics, is, too, hard, for, physicists, implying, that, the, necessary, mathematics, was, generally, beyond, them, the, courant, hilbert, book, made, it, easier, for, them, hilbert, unified, the, field, of, algebraic, number, theory, with, his, 1897, treatise, zahlbericht, literally, report, on, numbers, he, also, resolved, a, significant, number, theory, problem, formulated, by, waring, in, 1770, as, with, the, finiteness, theorem, he, used, an, existence, proof, that, shows, there, must, be, solutions, for, the, problem, rather, than, providing, a, mechanism, to, produce, the, answers, he, then, had, little, more, to, publish, on, the, subject, but, the, emergence, of, hilbert, modular, forms, in, the, dissertation, of, a, student, means, his, name, is, further, attached, to, a, major, area, he, made, a, series, of, conjectures, on, class, field, theory, the, concepts, were, highly, influential, and, his, own, contribution, lives, on, in, the, names, of, the, hilbert, class, field, and, of, the, hilbert, symbol, of, local, class, field, theory, results, were, mostly, proved, by, 1930, after, work, by, teiji, takagi, hilbert, did, not, work, in, the, central, areas, of, analytic, number, theory, but, his, name, has, become, known, for, the, hilbert, p, lya, conjecture, for, reasons, that, are, anecdotal, ernst, hellinger, a, student, of, hilbert, once, told, andr, weil, that, hilbert, had, announced, in, his, seminar, in, the, early, 1900s, that, he, expected, the, proof, of, the, riemann, hypothesis, would, be, a, consequence, of, fredholm, s, work, on, integral, equations, with, a, symmetric, kernel, his, collected, works, gesammelte, abhandlungen, have, been, published, several, times, the, original, versions, of, his, papers, contained, many, technical, errors, of, varying, degree, when, the, collection, was, first, published, the, errors, were, corrected, and, it, was, found, that, this, could, be, done, without, major, changes, in, the, statements, of, the, theorems, with, one, exception, a, claimed, proof, of, the, continuum, hypothesis, the, errors, were, nonetheless, so, numerous, and, significant, that, it, took, olga, taussky, todd, three, years, to, make, the, corrections, the, hilberts, had, by, this, time, left, the, reformed, protestant, church, in, which, they, had, been, baptized, and, married, it, was, told, in, g, ttingen, that, when, franz, had, started, to, school, he, could, not, answer, the, question, what, religion, are, you, 1970, p, 91
