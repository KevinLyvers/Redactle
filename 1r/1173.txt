navarre, he, was, also, king, of, navarre, as, philip, i, from, 1284, to, 1305, as, well, as, count, of, champagne, although, philip, was, known, to, be, handsome, hence, the, epithet, le, bel, his, rigid, autocratic, imposing, and, inflexible, personality, gained, him, from, friend, and, foe, alike, other, nicknames, such, as, the, iron, king, french, le, roi, de, fer, his, fierce, opponent, bernard, saisset, bishop, of, pamiers, said, of, him, he, is, neither, man, nor, beast, he, is, a, statue, philip, seeking, to, reduce, the, wealth, and, power, of, the, nobility, and, clergy, relied, instead, on, skillful, civil, servants, such, as, guillaume, de, nogaret, and, enguerrand, de, marigny, to, govern, the, kingdom, the, king, who, sought, an, uncontested, monarchy, compelled, his, vassals, by, wars, and, restricted, their, feudal, privileges, paving, the, way, for, the, transformation, of, france, from, a, feudal, country, to, a, centralized, early, modern, state, internationally, philip, s, ambitions, made, him, highly, influential, in, european, affairs, and, for, much, of, his, reign, he, sought, to, place, his, relatives, on, foreign, thrones, princes, from, his, house, ruled, in, hungary, and, he, tried, and, failed, to, make, another, relative, the, holy, roman, emperor, the, most, notable, conflicts, of, philip, s, reign, include, a, dispute, with, the, english, over, king, edward, i, s, duchy, in, southwestern, france, and, a, war, with, the, county, of, flanders, who, had, rebelled, against, french, royal, authority, and, humiliated, philip, at, the, battle, of, the, golden, spurs, in, 1302, the, war, with, the, flemish, resulted, in, philip, s, ultimate, victory, after, which, he, received, a, significant, portion, of, flemish, cities, which, were, added, to, the, crown, lands, along, with, a, vast, sum, of, money, domestically, his, reign, was, marked, by, struggles, with, the, jews, and, the, knights, templar, in, heavy, debt, to, both, groups, philip, saw, them, as, a, state, within, the, state, and, a, recurring, threat, to, royal, power, in, 1306, philip, expelled, the, jews, from, france, followed, by, the, total, destruction, of, the, knights, templar, the, next, year, in, 1307, to, further, strengthen, the, monarchy, philip, tried, to, tax, and, impose, state, control, over, the, catholic, church, in, france, leading, to, a, violent, dispute, with, pope, boniface, viii, the, ensuing, conflict, saw, the, pope, s, residence, at, anagni, attacked, in, september, 1303, by, french, forces, with, the, support, of, the, colonna, family, pope, boniface, was, captured, and, held, hostage, for, a, number, of, days, this, eventually, led, to, the, avignon, papacy, of, 1309, to, 1376, his, final, year, saw, a, scandal, amongst, the, royal, family, known, as, the, tour, de, nesle, affair, in, which, king, philip, s, three, daughters, in, law, were, accused, of, adultery, his, three, sons, were, successively, kings, of, france, louis, x, philip, v, and, charles, iv, their, rapid, successive, deaths, without, surviving, sons, of, their, own, would, compromise, the, future, of, the, french, royal, house, which, had, until, then, seemed, secure, precipitating, a, succession, crisis, that, would, eventually, lead, to, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, a, member, of, the, house, of, capet, philip, was, born, in, 1268, in, the, medieval, fortress, of, fontainebleau, seine, et, marne, to, the, future, philip, iii, the, bold, and, his, first, wife, isabella, of, aragon, his, father, was, the, heir, apparent, of, france, being, the, eldest, son, of, king, louis, ix, in, august, 1270, when, philip, was, two, years, old, his, grandfather, died, while, on, crusade, his, father, became, king, and, his, elder, brother, louis, became, heir, apparent, only, five, months, later, in, january, 1271, philip, s, mother, died, after, falling, from, a, horse, she, was, pregnant, with, her, fifth, child, at, the, time, and, had, not, yet, been, crowned, queen, beside, her, husband, a, few, months, later, one, of, philip, s, younger, brothers, robert, also, died, philip, s, father, was, finally, crowned, king, at, rheims, on, 15, august, 1271, six, days, later, he, married, again, philip, s, stepmother, was, marie, daughter, of, the, duke, of, brabant, in, may, 1276, philip, s, elder, brother, louis, died, and, the, eight, year, old, philip, became, heir, apparent, it, was, suspected, that, louis, had, been, poisoned, and, that, his, stepmother, marie, of, brabant, had, instigated, the, murder, one, reason, for, these, rumours, was, the, fact, that, the, queen, had, given, birth, to, her, own, first, son, the, month, louis, died, however, both, philip, and, his, surviving, full, brother, charles, lived, well, into, adulthood, and, raised, large, families, of, their, own, the, scholastic, part, of, philip, s, education, was, entrusted, to, guillaume, d, ercuis, his, father, s, almoner, after, the, unsuccessful, aragonese, crusade, against, peter, iii, of, aragon, which, ended, in, october, 1285, philip, may, have, negotiated, an, agreement, with, peter, for, the, safe, withdrawal, of, the, crusader, army, this, pact, is, attested, to, by, catalan, chroniclers, joseph, strayer, points, out, that, such, a, deal, was, probably, unnecessary, as, peter, had, little, to, gain, from, provoking, a, battle, with, the, withdrawing, french, or, angering, the, young, philip, who, had, friendly, relations, with, aragon, through, his, mother, philip, married, queen, joan, i, of, navarre, 1271, 1305, on, 16, august, 1284, the, two, were, affectionate, and, devoted, to, each, other, and, philip, refused, to, remarry, after, joan, s, death, in, 1305, despite, the, great, political, and, financial, rewards, of, doing, so, the, primary, administrative, benefit, of, the, marriage, was, joan, s, inheritance, of, champagne, and, brie, which, were, adjacent, to, the, royal, demesne, in, ile, de, france, and, thus, effectively, were, united, to, the, king, s, own, lands, expanding, his, realm, the, annexation, of, wealthy, champagne, increased, the, royal, revenues, considerably, removed, the, autonomy, of, a, large, semi, independent, fief, and, expanded, royal, territory, eastward, philip, also, gained, lyon, for, france, in, 1312, navarre, remained, in, personal, union, with, france, beginning, in, 1284, under, philip, and, joan, for, 44, years, the, kingdom, of, navarre, in, the, pyrenees, was, poor, but, had, a, degree, of, strategic, importance, when, in, 1328, the, capetian, line, went, extinct, the, new, valois, king, philip, vi, attempted, to, permanently, annex, the, lands, to, france, compensating, the, lawful, claimant, joan, ii, of, navarre, senior, heir, of, philip, iv, with, lands, elsewhere, in, france, however, pressure, from, joan, ii, s, family, led, to, phillip, vi, surrendering, the, land, to, joan, in, 1329, and, the, rulers, of, navarre, and, france, were, again, different, individuals, after, marrying, joan, i, of, navarre, becoming, philip, i, of, navarre, philip, ascended, the, french, throne, at, the, age, of, 17, he, was, crowned, as, king, on, 6, january, 1286, in, reims, as, king, philip, was, determined, to, strengthen, the, monarchy, at, any, cost, he, relied, more, than, any, of, his, predecessors, on, a, professional, bureaucracy, of, legalists, to, the, public, he, kept, aloof, and, left, specific, policies, especially, unpopular, ones, to, his, ministers, as, such, he, was, compared, to, a, useless, owl, by, bishop, saisset, others, like, william, of, nogaret, idealized, him, praising, him, for, his, piety, and, support, of, the, church, his, reign, marks, the, transition, to, a, more, centralized, administration, characterized, by, the, emergence, or, consolidation, of, the, king, s, council, the, parlement, and, the, court, of, auditors, a, move, under, a, certain, historical, reading, towards, modernity, as, the, duke, of, aquitaine, english, king, edward, i, was, a, vassal, to, philip, and, had, to, pay, him, homage, following, the, fall, of, acre, in, 1291, however, the, former, allies, started, to, show, dissent, in, 1293, following, feuding, between, english, and, french, sailors, that, led, to, several, seized, ships, and, the, sacking, of, la, rochelle, philip, summoned, edward, to, the, french, court, the, english, king, sought, to, negotiate, the, matter, via, ambassadors, sent, to, paris, but, they, were, turned, away, with, a, blunt, refusal, philip, addressed, edward, as, a, duke, a, vassal, and, nothing, more, despite, the, international, implications, of, the, relationship, between, england, and, france, edward, next, attempted, to, use, family, connections, to, achieve, what, open, politics, had, not, he, sent, his, brother, edmund, crouchback, who, was, philip, s, cousin, as, well, as, his, step, father, in, law, in, attempts, to, negotiate, with, the, french, royal, family, and, avert, war, additionally, edward, had, by, that, time, become, betrothed, by, proxy, to, philip, s, sister, margaret, and, in, the, event, of, the, negotiations, being, successful, edmund, was, to, escort, margaret, back, to, england, for, her, wedding, to, edward, an, agreement, was, indeed, reached, it, stated, that, edward, would, temporarily, relinquish, gascony, to, philip, as, a, sign, of, submission, in, his, capacity, as, the, duke, of, aquitaine, in, return, philip, would, forgive, edward, and, restore, gascony, after, a, grace, period, in, the, matter, of, the, marriage, philip, drove, a, hard, bargain, based, partially, on, the, difference, in, age, between, edward, and, margaret, it, was, agreed, that, the, province, of, gascony, would, be, retained, by, philip, in, return, for, agreeing, to, the, marriage, the, date, of, the, wedding, was, also, put, off, until, the, formality, of, sequestering, and, regranting, the, french, lands, back, to, edward, was, completed, but, edward, edmund, and, the, english, had, been, deceived, the, french, had, no, intention, of, returning, the, land, to, the, english, monarch, edward, kept, up, his, part, of, the, deal, and, turned, over, his, continental, estates, to, the, french, however, philip, used, the, pretext, that, the, english, king, had, refused, his, summons, in, order, to, declare, edward, s, fiefs, entirely, forfeit, initiating, hostilities, with, england, the, 1294, 1303, gascon, war, was, the, inevitable, result, of, the, competitive, expansionist, monarchies, but, the, direct, campaigns, between, the, two, countries, in, aquitaine, and, flanders, were, inconclusive, instead, the, larger, consequences, were, from, the, taxation, undertaken, to, pay, for, them, and, in, the, alliances, used, france, initiated, the, auld, alliance, between, itself, and, scotland, underwriting, much, of, the, prolonged, first, scottish, war, of, independence, meanwhile, england, assisted, flanders, in, its, own, war, against, france, the, decimation, of, a, generation, of, french, nobility, at, the, battle, of, the, golden, spurs, forced, philip, to, abandon, his, occupation, of, aquitaine, pursuant, to, the, terms, of, the, interim, 1299, treaty, of, montreuil, the, marriage, of, philip, s, young, daughter, isabella, to, edward, s, son, edward, ii, was, celebrated, at, boulogne, on, 25, january, 1308, meant, to, further, seal, a, lasting, peace, it, eventually, produced, an, english, claimant, to, the, french, throne, itself, leading, to, the, hundred, years, war, philip, suffered, a, major, setback, when, an, army, of, 2, 500, noble, men, at, arms, knights, and, squires, and, 4, 000, infantry, he, sent, to, suppress, an, uprising, in, flanders, was, defeated, in, the, battle, of, the, golden, spurs, near, kortrijk, on, 11, july, 1302, philip, reacted, with, energy, two, years, later, at, the, battle, of, mons, en, p, v, le, which, ended, in, a, decisive, french, victory, consequently, in, 1305, philip, forced, the, flemish, to, accept, a, harsh, peace, treaty, which, exacted, heavy, reparations, and, penalties, and, added, to, the, royal, territory, the, rich, cloth, cities, of, lille, douai, and, bethune, sites, of, major, cloth, fairs, b, thune, first, of, the, flemish, cities, to, yield, was, granted, to, mahaut, countess, of, artois, whose, two, daughters, to, secure, her, fidelity, were, married, to, philip, s, two, sons, philip, had, various, contacts, with, the, mongol, power, in, the, middle, east, including, reception, at, the, embassy, of, the, uyghur, monk, rabban, bar, sauma, originally, from, the, yuan, dynasty, of, china, bar, sauma, presented, an, offer, of, a, franco, mongol, alliance, with, arghun, of, the, mongol, ilkhanate, in, baghdad, arghun, was, seeking, to, join, forces, between, the, mongols, and, the, europeans, against, their, common, enemy, the, muslim, mamluks, in, return, arghun, offered, to, return, jerusalem, to, the, christians, once, it, was, re, captured, from, the, muslims, philip, seemingly, responded, positively, to, the, request, of, the, embassy, by, sending, one, of, his, noblemen, gobert, de, helleville, to, accompany, bar, sauma, back, to, mongol, lands, there, was, further, correspondence, between, arghun, and, philip, in, 1288, and, 1289, outlining, potential, military, cooperation, however, philip, never, actually, pursued, such, military, plans, in, april, 1305, the, new, mongol, ruler, ljait, sent, letters, to, philip, the, pope, and, edward, i, of, england, he, again, offered, a, military, collaboration, between, the, christian, nations, of, europe, and, the, mongols, against, the, mamluks, european, nations, attempted, another, crusade, but, were, delayed, and, it, never, took, place, on, 4, april, 1312, another, crusade, was, promulgated, at, the, council, of, vienne, in, 1313, philip, took, the, cross, making, the, vow, to, go, on, a, crusade, in, the, levant, thus, responding, to, pope, clement, v, s, call, he, was, however, warned, against, leaving, by, enguerrand, de, marigny, and, died, soon, after, in, a, hunting, accident, under, philip, iv, the, annual, ordinary, revenues, of, the, french, royal, government, totaled, approximately, 860, 000, livres, tournois, equivalent, to, 46, tonnes, of, silver, overall, revenues, were, about, twice, the, ordinary, revenues, some, 30, of, the, revenues, were, collected, from, the, royal, demesne, the, royal, financial, administration, employed, perhaps, 3, 000, people, of, which, about, 1, 000, were, officials, in, the, proper, sense, after, assuming, the, throne, philip, inherited, a, sizable, debt, from, his, father, s, war, against, aragon, by, november, 1286, it, reached, 8, tonnes, of, silver, to, his, primary, financiers, the, templars, equivalent, to, 17, of, government, revenue, this, debt, was, quickly, paid, off, and, in, 1287, and, 1288, philip, s, kingdom, ran, a, budget, surplus, after, 1289, a, decline, in, saxony, s, silver, production, combined, with, philip, s, wars, against, aragon, england, and, flanders, drove, the, french, government, to, fiscal, deficits, the, war, against, aragon, inherited, from, philip, s, father, required, the, expenditure, of, 1, 5, million, lt, livres, tournois, and, the, 1294, 99, war, against, england, over, gascony, another, 1, 73, million, lt, loans, from, the, aragonese, war, were, still, being, paid, back, in, 1306, to, cover, the, deficit, pope, nicholas, iv, in, 1289, granted, philip, permission, to, collect, a, tithe, of, 152, 000, lp, livres, parisis, from, the, church, lands, in, france, with, revenues, of, 1, 52, million, lp, the, church, in, france, had, greater, fiscal, resources, than, the, royal, government, whose, ordinary, revenues, in, 1289, amounted, to, 595, 318, lp, and, overall, revenues, to, 1, 2, million, lp, by, november, 1290, the, deficit, stood, at, 6, of, revenues, in, 1291, the, budget, swung, back, into, surplus, only, to, fall, into, deficit, again, in, 1292, the, constant, deficits, led, philip, to, order, the, arrest, of, the, lombard, merchants, who, had, earlier, made, him, extensive, loans, on, the, pledge, of, repayment, from, future, taxation, the, lombards, assets, were, seized, by, government, agents, and, the, crown, extracted, 250, 000, lt, by, forcing, the, lombards, to, purchase, french, nationality, despite, this, draconian, measure, the, deficits, continued, to, stack, up, in, 1293, by, 1295, philip, had, replaced, the, templars, with, the, florentine, franzesi, bankers, as, his, main, source, of, finance, the, italians, could, raise, huge, loans, far, beyond, the, capacities, of, the, templars, and, philip, came, to, rely, on, them, more, and, more, the, royal, treasure, was, transferred, from, the, paris, temple, to, the, louvre, around, this, time, in, 1294, france, and, england, went, to, war, and, in, 1297, the, county, of, flanders, declared, its, independence, from, france, this, conflict, accelerated, the, financial, problems, incurred, by, the, french, monarch, as, warfare, continued, and, fiscal, deficits, persisted, philip, had, no, remedy, but, to, use, debasement, of, coinage, as, an, alternative, tool, to, meet, his, military, expenditures, this, measure, made, people, wary, of, taking, their, coins, to, royal, mints, preferring, to, take, their, silver, abroad, to, exchange, it, for, strong, currencies, which, by, 1301, led, to, a, dramatic, disappearance, of, silver, in, france, currency, depreciation, provided, the, crown, with, 1, 419, million, lp, from, november, 1296, to, christmas, 1299, more, than, enough, to, cover, war, costs, of, 1, 066, million, lp, in, the, same, period, the, resulting, inflation, damaged, the, real, incomes, of, the, creditors, such, as, the, aristocracy, and, the, church, who, received, a, weaker, currency, in, return, for, the, loans, they, had, issued, in, a, stronger, currency, the, indebted, lower, classes, did, not, benefit, from, the, devaluation, as, the, high, inflation, ate, into, the, purchasing, power, of, their, money, the, result, was, social, unrest, by, 22, august, 1303, this, practice, led, to, a, two, thirds, loss, in, the, value, of, the, livres, sous, and, deniers, in, circulation, the, defeat, at, the, battle, of, golden, spurs, in, 1302, was, a, crushing, blow, to, french, finance, the, 15, months, which, followed, this, battle, saw, a, depreciation, of, the, currency, by, 37, and, new, decrees, were, issued, forbidding, the, export, of, gold, and, silver, abroad, the, royal, government, had, to, order, officials, and, subjects, to, provide, all, or, half, respectively, of, their, silver, vessels, for, minting, into, coins, new, taxes, were, levied, to, pay, for, the, deficit, as, people, attempted, to, move, their, wealth, out, of, the, country, in, non, monetary, form, philip, banned, merchandise, exports, without, royal, approval, the, king, obtained, another, crusade, tithe, from, the, pope, and, returned, the, royal, treasure, to, the, temple, to, gain, the, templars, as, his, creditors, again, despite, their, consequences, these, decisions, were, not, considered, immoral, at, that, time, as, they, were, the, prince, s, accepted, right, and, this, right, could, be, taken, far, if, a, special, situation, such, as, war, justified, it, furthermore, the, issue, of, coins, with, a, lower, content, of, silver, was, needed, to, maintain, circulation, in, a, context, where, the, inflation, of, silver, produced, a, severe, scarcity, of, currency, due, to, the, ongoing, commercial, revolution, after, bringing, the, flemish, war, to, a, victorious, conclusion, in, 1305, philip, on, 8, june, 1306, ordered, the, silver, content, of, new, coinage, to, be, raised, back, to, its, 1285, level, of, 3, 96, grams, of, silver, per, livre, to, harmonize, the, strength, of, the, old, and, new, currencies, the, debased, coinage, of, 1303, was, devalued, accordingly, by, two, thirds, the, debtors, were, driven, to, penury, by, the, need, to, repay, their, loans, in, the, new, strong, currency, this, led, to, rioting, in, paris, on, 30, december, 1306, forcing, philip, to, briefly, seek, refuge, in, the, paris, temple, the, headquarters, of, the, knights, templar, perhaps, seeking, to, control, the, silver, of, the, jewish, mints, to, put, the, revaluation, to, effect, philip, ordered, the, expulsion, of, the, jews, on, 22, july, 1306, and, confiscated, their, property, on, 23, august, collecting, at, least, 140, 000, lp, with, this, measure, with, the, jews, gone, philip, appointed, royal, guardians, to, collect, the, loans, made, by, the, jews, and, the, money, was, passed, to, the, crown, after, philip, in, 1315, the, jews, were, invited, back, with, an, offer, of, 12, years, of, guaranteed, residence, free, from, government, interference, in, 1322, the, jews, were, expelled, again, by, the, king, s, successor, when, philip, levied, taxes, on, the, french, clergy, of, one, half, their, annual, income, he, caused, an, uproar, within, the, catholic, church, and, the, papacy, prompting, pope, boniface, viii, to, issue, the, bull, clericis, laicos, 1296, forbidding, the, transference, of, any, church, property, to, the, french, crown, philip, retaliated, by, forbidding, the, removal, of, bullion, from, france, by, 1297, boniface, agreed, to, philip, s, taxation, of, the, clergy, in, emergencies, in, 1301, philip, had, the, bishop, of, pamier, arrested, for, treason, boniface, called, french, bishops, to, rome, to, discuss, philip, s, actions, in, response, philip, convoked, an, assembly, of, bishops, nobles, and, grand, bourgeois, of, paris, in, order, to, condemn, the, pope, this, precursor, to, the, estates, general, appeared, for, the, first, time, during, his, reign, a, measure, of, the, professionalism, and, order, that, his, ministers, were, introducing, into, government, this, assembly, which, was, composed, of, clergy, nobles, and, burghers, gave, support, to, philip, boniface, retaliated, with, the, famous, bull, unam, sanctam, 1302, a, declaration, of, papal, supremacy, philip, gained, victory, after, having, sent, his, agent, guillaume, de, nogaret, to, arrest, boniface, at, anagni, the, pope, escaped, but, died, soon, afterward, the, french, archbishop, bertrand, de, goth, was, elected, pope, as, clement, v, and, thus, began, the, so, called, babylonian, captivity, of, the, papacy, 1309, 76, during, which, the, official, seat, of, the, papacy, moved, to, avignon, an, enclave, surrounded, by, french, territories, and, was, subjected, to, french, control, philip, was, substantially, in, debt, to, the, knights, templar, a, monastic, military, order, whose, original, role, as, protectors, of, christian, pilgrims, in, the, latin, east, had, been, largely, replaced, by, banking, and, other, commercial, activities, by, the, end, of, the, 13th, century, as, the, popularity, of, the, crusades, had, decreased, support, for, the, military, orders, had, waned, and, philip, used, a, disgruntled, complaint, against, the, knights, templar, as, an, excuse, to, move, against, the, entire, organization, as, it, existed, in, france, in, part, to, free, himself, from, his, debts, other, motives, appear, to, have, included, concern, over, perceived, heresy, assertion, of, french, control, over, a, weakened, papacy, and, finally, the, substitution, of, royal, officials, for, officers, of, the, temple, in, the, financial, management, of, french, government, recent, studies, emphasize, the, political, and, religious, motivations, of, philip, the, fair, and, his, ministers, especially, guillaume, de, nogaret, it, seems, that, with, the, discovery, and, repression, of, the, templars, heresy, the, capetian, monarchy, claimed, for, itself, the, mystic, foundations, of, the, papal, theocracy, the, temple, case, was, the, last, step, of, a, process, of, appropriating, these, foundations, which, had, begun, with, the, franco, papal, rift, at, the, time, of, boniface, viii, being, the, ultimate, defender, of, the, catholic, faith, the, capetian, king, was, invested, with, a, christ, like, function, that, put, him, above, the, pope, what, was, at, stake, in, the, templars, trial, then, was, the, establishment, of, a, royal, theocracy, at, daybreak, on, friday, 13, october, 1307, hundreds, of, templars, in, france, were, simultaneously, arrested, by, agents, of, philip, the, fair, to, be, later, tortured, into, admitting, heresy, in, the, order, the, templars, were, supposedly, answerable, only, to, the, pope, but, philip, used, his, influence, over, clement, v, who, was, largely, his, pawn, to, disband, the, organization, pope, clement, did, attempt, to, hold, proper, trials, but, philip, used, the, previously, forced, confessions, to, have, many, templars, burned, at, the, stake, before, they, could, mount, a, proper, defence, in, march, 1314, philip, had, jacques, de, molay, the, last, grand, master, of, the,

visitor, of, france, and, godefroi, de, gonneville, master, of, aquitaine, were, brought, forth, from, the, jail, in, which, for, nearly, seven, years, they, had, lain, to, receive, the, sentence, agreed, upon, by, the, cardinals, in, conjunction, with, the, archbishop, of, sens, and, some, other, prelates, whom, they, had, called, in, considering, the, offences, which, the, culprits, had, confessed, and, confirmed, the, penance, imposed, was, in, accordance, with, rule, that, of, perpetual, imprisonment, the, affair, was, supposed, to, be, concluded, when, to, the, dismay, of, the,

and, de, charney, were, slowly, burned, to, death, refusing, all, offers, of, pardon, for, retraction, and, bearing, their, torment, with, a, composure, which, won, for, them, the, reputation, of,

popular, among, the, french, population, even, in, germany, philip, s, death, was, spoken, of, as, a, retribution, for, his, destruction, of, the, templars, and, clement, was, described, as, shedding, tears, of, remorse, on, his, deathbed, for, three, great, crimes, namely, the, poisoning, of, henry, vii, holy, roman, emperor, and, the, ruin, of, the, templars, and, beguines, within, fourteen,
