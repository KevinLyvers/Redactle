islamic, jurisprudence, in, sunni, islam, born, in, medina, into, the, clan, of, banu, himyar, malik, studied, under, hisham, ibn, urwa, ibn, shihab, al, zuhri, ja, far, al, sadiq, nafi, ibn, sarjis, and, others, he, rose, to, become, the, premier, scholar, of, hadith, in, his, day, referred, to, as, the, imam, of, medina, by, his, contemporaries, his, views, in, matters, of, jurisprudence, became, highly, cherished, both, in, his, own, life, and, afterward, becoming, the, eponym, of, the, maliki, school, one, of, the, four, major, schools, of, islamic, jurisprudence, his, school, became, the, normative, rite, for, sunni, practice, in, much, of, north, africa, al, andalus, until, the, expulsion, of, medieval, native, iberian, muslims, a, vast, portion, of, egypt, some, parts, of, syria, yemen, sudan, iraq, and, khorasan, and, the, prominent, orders, in, sufism, the, shadili, and, tijani, perhaps, malik, s, most, famous, accomplishment, in, the, annals, of, islamic, history, is, however, his, compilation, of, al, muwatta, one, of, the, oldest, and, most, revered, sunni, hadith, collections, and, one, of, the, earliest, surviving, muslim, law, book, in, which, malik, attempted, to, give, a, survey, of, law, and, justice, ritual, and, practice, of, religion, according, to, the, consensus, of, islam, in, medina, according, to, the, sunna, usual, in, medina, and, to, create, a, theoretical, standard, for, matters, which, were, not, settled, from, the, point, of, view, of, consensus, and, sunna, composed, in, the, early, days, of, the, abbasid, caliphate, during, which, time, there, was, a, burgeoning, recognition, and, appreciation, of, the, canon, law, of, the, ruling, party, malik, s, work, aimed, to, trace, out, a, smoothed, path, which, is, what, al, muwa, a, literally, means, through, the, farreaching, differences, of, opinion, even, on, the, most, elementary, questions, hailed, as, the, soundest, book, on, earth, after, the, quran, by, al, shafi, i, the, compilation, of, al, muwatta, led, to, malik, being, bestowed, with, such, reverential, epithets, as, shaykh, al, islam, proof, of, the, community, imam, of, the, believers, in, hadith, imam, of, the, abode, of, emigration, and, knowledgeable, scholar, of, medina, in, later, sunni, tradition, according, to, classical, sunni, tradition, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, foretold, the, birth, of, malik, saying, very, soon, will, people, beat, the, flanks, of, camels, in, search, of, knowledge, and, they, shall, find, no, one, more, expert, than, the, knowledgeable, scholar, of, medina, and, in, another, tradition, the, people, shall, set, forth, from, east, and, west, without, finding, a, sage, other, than, the, sage, of, the, people, in, medina, while, some, later, scholars, such, as, ibn, hazm, and, al, tahawi, did, cast, doubt, on, identifying, the, mysterious, wise, man, of, both, these, traditions, with, malik, the, most, widespread, interpretation, nevertheless, continued, to, be, that, which, held, the, personage, to, be, malik, throughout, islamic, history, malik, has, been, venerated, as, an, exemplary, figure, in, all, the, traditional, schools, of, sunni, thought, both, by, the, exoteric, ulema, and, by, the, mystics, with, the, latter, often, designating, him, as, a, saint, in, their, hagiographies, malik, s, most, notable, student, ash, shafi, i, who, would, himself, become, the, founder, of, another, of, the, four, orthodox, legal, schools, of, sunni, law, later, said, of, his, teacher, no, one, constitutes, as, great, a, favor, to, me, in, the, religion, of, god, as, malik, when, the, scholars, of, knowledge, are, mentioned, malik, is, the, star, malik, s, genealogy, is, as, follows, m, lik, ibn, anas, ibn, m, lik, ibn, ab, mir, ibn, amr, ibn, al, rith, ibn, ghaym, n, ibn, khuthayn, ibn, amr, ibn, al, rith, al, a, ba, al, umyar, al, madan, malik, was, born, as, the, son, of, anas, ibn, malik, not, the, sahabi, with, the, same, name, and, aaliyah, bint, shurayk, al, azdiyya, in, medina, c, 711, his, family, was, originally, from, the, al, asbahi, tribe, of, yemen, but, his, great, grandfather, abu, amir, relocated, the, family, to, medina, after, converting, to, islam, in, the, second, year, of, the, hijri, calendar, or, 623, ce, his, grandfather, malik, ibn, abi, amir, was, a, student, of, the, second, caliph, of, islam, umar, and, was, one, of, those, involved, in, the, collection, of, the, parchments, upon, which, quranic, texts, were, originally, written, when, those, were, collected, during, the, caliph, uthman, era, according, to, al, muwatta, he, was, tall, heavyset, imposing, of, stature, very, fair, with, white, hair, and, beard, but, bald, with, a, huge, beard, and, blue, eyes, living, in, medina, gave, malik, access, to, some, of, the, most, learned, minds, of, early, islam, he, memorized, the, quran, in, his, youth, learning, recitation, from, abu, suhail, nafi, ibn, abd, ar, rahman, from, whom, he, also, received, his, ijazah, or, certification, and, permission, to, teach, others, he, studied, under, various, famed, scholars, including, hisham, ibn, urwah, and, ibn, shihab, al, zuhri, as, well, as, the, famed, imam, jafar, al, sadiq, both, malik, and, al, zuhri, were, student, to, nafi, mawla, ibn, umar, prestigious, tabi, un, imam, and, freed, slave, of, abdullah, ibn, umar, along, with, abu, hanifah, founder, of, the, hanafi, sunni, madh, hab, imam, malik, studied, also, with, imam, jafar, a, wellknown, scholar, of, his, time, who, is, regarded, by, shia, muslims, as, their, imam, imam, malik, was, a, teacher, of, imam, shafi, who, in, turn, was, a, teacher, of, imam, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, malik, s, chain, of, narrators, was, considered, the, most, authentic, and, called, silsilat, al, dhahab, or, the, golden, chain, of, narrators, by, notable, hadith, scholars, including, muhammad, al, bukhari, the, golden, chain, of, narration, i, e, that, considered, by, the, scholars, of, hadith, to, be, the, most, authentic, consists, of, malik, who, narrated, from, nafi, mawla, ibn, umar, who, narrated, from, ibn, umar, who, narrated, from, muhammad, abdul, ghani, ad, daqr, wrote, that, malik, was, the, furthest, of, all, people, from, dialectic, theology, who, was, the, most, knowledgeable, of, their, discussions, without, accepting, their, views, g, f, haddad, on, the, other, hand, argued, that, malik, was, not, completely, averse, to, the, idea, of, dialectic, theology, on, the, contrary, haddad, points, to, malik, having, studied, at, the, feet, of, ibn, hurmuz, a, master, in, dialectic, theology, for, thirteen, to, sixteen, years, malik, s, unique, contributions, to, the, field, of, theology, specifically, is, that, he, was, a, strict, opponent, of, anthropomorphism, and, deemed, it, absurd, to, compare, the, attributes, of, god, with, those, of, man, for, example, when, a, man, asked, malik, about, the, meaning, of, quran, 20, 5, the, merciful, made, istiwa, over, the, throne, it, is, related, that, nothing, affected, malik, so, much, as, that, man, s, question, and, the, jurist, fervently, responded, the, how, of, it, is, not, existent, the, istiwa, part, is, known, belief, in, it, is, obligatory, asking, about, it, is, an, innovation, malik, was, a, supporter, of, the, orthodox, sunni, doctrine, of, the, beatific, vision, and, he, is, said, to, have, cited, quran, 75, 22, 23, that, day, will, faces, be, resplendent, looking, toward, their, lord, and, 83, 15, nay, verily, from, their, lord, that, day, shall, they, be, veiled, as, proof, of, his, belief, when, he, was, asked, about, the, nature, of, faith, malik, defined, it, as, speech, and, works, qawlun, wa, amal, which, shows, that, malik, was, averse, to, the, rigorous, separation, of, faith, and, works, malik, seems, to, have, been, a, proponent, of, intercession, in, personal, supplication, for, example, it, is, related, that, when, the, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, asked, malik, about, whether, it, was, preferable, to, face, the, prophet, s, tomb, or, the, qibla, whilst, doing, the, personal, prayer, or, dua, malik, responded, why, should, you, not, face, him, when, he, is, your, means, was, la, to, god, and, that, of, your, father, adam, on, the, day, of, resurrection, regarding, this, tradition, the, thirteenth, century, hadith, master, ibn, jam, a, said, the, report, is, related, by, the, two, hadith, masters, ibn, bashkuw, l, and, al, q, iy, in, al, shif, and, no, attention, is, paid, to, the, words, of, those, who, claim, that, it, is, forged, purely, on, the, basis, of, their, idle, desires, historically, it, is, known, that, malik, s, statements, on, the, validity, of, intercession, remained, a, core, doctrine, of, the, maliki, school, and, practically, all, maliki, thinkers, of, the, classical, era, accepted, the, idea, of, the, prophet, s, intercession, it, is, also, known, moreover, that, the, classical, books, of, the, m, lik, s, are, replete, with, the, stipulation, that, du, be, made, while, facing, the, grave, on, the, basis, of, several, early, traditions, it, is, evident, that, malik, held, the, early, sufis, and, their, practices, in, high, regard, it, is, related, moreover, that, malik, was, a, strong, proponent, of, combining, the, inward, science, ilm, al, b, tin, of, mystical, knowledge, with, the, outward, science, of, jurisprudence, for, example, the, famous, twelfth, century, maliki, jurist, and, judge, qadi, iyad, later, venerated, as, a, saint, throughout, the, iberian, peninsula, narrated, a, tradition, in, which, a, man, asked, malik, about, something, in, the, inward, science, to, which, malik, replied, truly, none, knows, the, inward, science, except, those, who, know, the, outward, science, when, he, knows, the, outward, science, and, puts, it, into, practice, god, shall, open, for, him, the, inward, science, and, that, will, not, take, place, except, by, the, opening, of, his, heart, and, its, enlightenment, while, there, are, a, few, traditions, relating, that, malik, while, not, an, opponent, of, mysticism, as, a, whole, was, nonetheless, adverse, specifically, to, the, practice, of, group, dhikr, such, traditions, have, been, graded, as, being, munkar, or, weak, in, their, chain, of, transmission, furthermore, it, has, been, argued, that, none, of, these, reports, all, of, which, relate, malik, s, disapproving, amusement, at, being, told, about, an, instance, of, group, dhikr, happening, nearby, explicitly, display, any, disapproval, of, the, act, as, such, but, rather, serve, as, a, criticism, of, some, people, who, passed, for, sufis, in, his, time, apparently, committed, certain, excesses, or, breaches, of, the, sacred, law, as, both, their, chains, of, transmission, are, weak, and, not, consistent, with, what, is, related, of, malik, elsewhere, the, traditions, are, rejected, by, many, scholars, although, latter, day, critics, of, sufism, do, occasionally, cite, them, in, support, of, their, position, malik, was, a, supporter, of, tabarruk, or, the, seeking, of, blessing, through, relics, this, is, evident, for, example, in, the, fact, that, malik, approvingly, related, the, tradition, of, a, certain, at, ibn, ab, rab, h, whom, he, saw, enter, the, mosque, then, take, hold, of, the, pommel, of, the, pulpit, after, which, he, faced, the, qibla, thereby, supporting, the, holding, of, the, pommel, for, its, blessings, baraka, by, virtue, of, its, having, touched, muhammad, furthermore, it, is, also, recorded, that, when, one, of, the, caliphs, manifested, his, intention, to, replace, the, wooden, pulpit, of, the, prophet, with, a, pulpit, of, silver, and, jewels, malik, exclaimed, i, do, not, consider, it, good, that, people, be, deprived, of, the, relics, of, the, messenger, of, god, l, ar, yu, rama, al, n, su, th, ra, ras, lill, h, malik, considered, following, the, sunnah, of, muhammad, to, be, of, capital, importance, for, every, muslim, it, is, reported, that, he, said, the, sunnah, is, noah, s, ark, whoever, boards, it, is, saved, and, whoever, remains, away, from, it, perishes, accounts, of, malik, s, life, demonstrate, that, the, scholar, cherished, differences, of, opinion, amongst, the, ulema, as, a, mercy, from, god, to, the, islamic, community, even, in, malik, s, time, there, were, those, who, forwarded, the, idea, of, a, unified, madhhab, and, the, ostensive, removal, of, all, differences, between, the, sunni, schools, of, law, with, three, successive, caliphs, having, sought, to, impose, the, muwatta, and, malik, s, school, upon, the, entire, islamic, world, of, their, time, but, malik, refused, to, allow, it, every, time, were, a, mercy, for, the, people, when, the, second, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, said, to, malik, i, want, to, unify, this, knowledge, i, shall, write, to, the, leaders, of, the, armies, and, to, the, rulers, so, that, they, make, it, law, and, whoever, contravenes, it, shall, be, put, to, death, malik, is, said, to, have, responded, commander, of, the, believers, there, is, another, way, truly, the, prophet, was, present, in, this, community, he, used, to, send, out, troops, or, set, forth, in, person, and, he, did, not, conquer, many, lands, until, god, took, back, his, soul, then, abu, bakr, arose, and, he, also, did, not, conquer, many, lands, then, umar, arose, after, the, two, of, them, and, many, lands, were, conquered, at, his, hands, as, a, result, he, faced, the, necessity, of, sending, out, the, companions, of, muhammad, as, teachers, and, people, did, not, cease, to, take, from, them, notable, scholars, from, notable, scholars, until, our, time, if, you, now, go, and, change, them, from, what, they, know, to, what, they, do, not, know, they, shall, deem, it, disbelief, kufr, rather, confirm, the, people, of, each, land, with, regard, to, whatever, knowledge, is, there, and, take, this, knowledge, to, yourself, according, to, another, narration, al, mansur, after, hearing, malik, s, answers, to, certain, important, questions, said, i, have, resolved, to, give, the, order, that, your, writings, be, copied, and, disseminated, to, every, muslim, region, on, earth, so, that, they, be, put, in, practice, exclusively, of, any, other, rulings, they, will, leave, aside, innovations, and, keep, only, this, knowledge, for, i, consider, that, the, source, of, knowledge, is, the, narrative, tradition, of, medina, and, the, knowledge, of, its, scholars, to, this, malik, is, said, to, have, replied, commander, of, the, believers, do, not, for, people, have, already, heard, different, positions, heard, hadith, and, related, narrations, every, group, has, taken, whatever, came, to, them, and, put, it, into, practice, conforming, to, it, while, other, people, differed, to, take, them, away, from, what, they, have, been, professing, will, cause, a, disaster, therefore, leave, people, with, whatever, school, they, follow, and, whatever, the, people, of, each, country, chose, for, themselves, malik, is, famous, for, declaring, the, shield, of, the, alim, is, i, do, not, know, if, he, neglects, it, he, will, receive, a, mortal, blow, elsewhere, a, certain, kh, lid, ibn, khid, sh, related, i, travelled, all, the, way, from, iraq, to, see, m, lik, about, forty, questions, he, did, not, answer, me, except, on, five, then, he, said, ibn, ijl, n, used, to, say, if, the, alim, bypasses, i, do, not, know, he, will, receive, a, mortal, blow, likewise, al, haytham, ibn, jam, l, said, i, saw, m, lik, ibn, anas, being, asked, forty, eight, questions, and, he, replied, to, thirty, two, of, them, i, do, not, know, later, on, malik, s, disciple, ibn, wahb, related, i, heard, abd, all, h, ibn, yaz, d, ibn, hurmuz, say, the, ulema, must, instill, in, those, who, sit, with, him, the, phrase, i, do, not, know, until, it, becomes, a, foundational, principle, asl, before, them, and, they, seek, refuge, in, it, from, danger, malik, is, said, to, have, detested, disputing, in, matters, of, religion, saying, disputation, al, jid, l, in, the, religion, fosters, self, display, does, away, with, the, light, of, the, heart, and, hardens, it, and, produces, aimless, wandering, needless, argument, therefore, was, disapproved, of, by, malik, and, he, also, chose, to, keep, silent, about, religious, matters, in, general, unless, he, felt, obliged, to, speak, in, fear, of, the, spread, of, misguidance, or, some, similar, danger, in, the, muwatta, malik, writes, shaving, the, mustache, is, an, innovation, elsewhere, it, is, written, that, he, detested, and, condemned, shaving, of, the, mustache, and, furthermore, disliked, inordinate, length, for, the, beard, while, several, other, scholars, held, both, the, clipping, qass, and, the, removal, ihf, of, the, mustache, to, be, sunnah, malik, only, considered, the, former, to, be, truly, prophetically, prescribed, deeming, the, latter, an, unpalatable, innovation, the, available, physical, descriptions, of, malik, relate, that, he, was, tall, heavy, set, imposing, of, stature, very, fair, with, white, beard, bald, blue, eyes, furthermore, it, is, also, related, that, he, always, wore, beautiful, clothes, especially, white, imam, malik, died, at, the, age, of, 83, or, 84, in, medina, in, 795, ce, and, is, buried, in, the, cemetery, of, al, baqi, across, from, the, mosque, of, the, prophet, although, there, was, a, small, shrine, constructed, around, his, grave, during, the, late, medieval, period, with, many, muslims, visiting, it, to, pay, their, respects, the, construction, was, razed, to, the, ground, by, the, kingdom, of, saudi, arabia, during, their, campaign, of, demolishing, many, of, the, traditional, islamic, heritage, sites, after, the, kingdom, s, establishment, in, 1932, malik, s, last, words, were, related, to, one, isma, il, ibn, abi, uways, who, said, malik, became, sick, so, i, asked, some, of, our, people, about, what, he, said, at, the, time, of, his, death, they, said, he, recited, the, testification, of, faith, and, then, he, recited, to, allah, belongs, the, command, before, and, after, abbasid, governor, of, mecca, and, medina, abdallah, al, zaynabi, led, the, prayers, at, the, funeral, of, malik, ibn, anas, in, 795, imam, malik,
