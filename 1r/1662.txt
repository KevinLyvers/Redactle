galileo, di, vincenzo, bonaiuti, de, galilei, 15, february, 1564, 8, january, 1642, commonly, referred, to, as, galileo, galilei, l, l, e, o, l, l, e, us, also, l, l, i, o, italian, was, an, italian, florentine, astronomer, physicist, and, engineer, sometimes, described, as, a, polymath, he, was, born, in, the, city, of, pisa, then, part, of, the, duchy, of, florence, and, present, day, italy, galileo, has, been, called, the, father, of, observational, astronomy, modern, era, classical, physics, the, scientific, method, and, modern, science, galileo, studied, speed, and, velocity, gravity, and, free, fall, the, principle, of, relativity, inertia, projectile, motion, and, also, worked, in, applied, science, and, technology, describing, the, properties, of, the, pendulum, and, hydrostatic, balances, he, was, one, of, the, earliest, renaissance, developers, of, the, thermoscope, and, the, inventor, of, various, military, compasses, with, an, improved, telescope, he, built, he, observed, the, stars, of, the, milky, way, the, phases, of, venus, the, four, largest, satellites, of, jupiter, saturn, s, rings, lunar, craters, and, sunspots, he, also, built, an, early, microscope, galileo, s, championing, of, copernican, heliocentrism, was, met, with, opposition, from, within, the, catholic, church, and, from, some, astronomers, the, matter, was, investigated, by, the, roman, inquisition, in, 1615, which, concluded, that, his, opinions, contradicted, accepted, biblical, interpretations, galileo, later, defended, his, views, in, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, 1632, which, appeared, to, attack, pope, urban, viii, and, thus, alienated, both, the, pope, and, the, jesuits, who, had, both, supported, galileo, up, until, this, point, he, was, tried, by, the, inquisition, found, vehemently, suspect, of, heresy, and, forced, to, recant, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, under, house, arrest, during, this, time, he, wrote, two, new, sciences, 1638, primarily, concerning, kinematics, and, the, strength, of, materials, galileo, was, born, in, pisa, then, part, of, the, duchy, of, florence, on, 15, february, 1564, the, first, of, six, children, of, vincenzo, galilei, a, leading, lutenist, composer, and, music, theorist, and, giulia, ammannati, the, daughter, of, a, prominent, merchant, who, had, married, two, years, earlier, in, 1562, when, he, was, 42, and, she, was, 24, galileo, became, an, accomplished, lutenist, himself, and, would, have, learned, early, from, his, father, a, skepticism, for, established, authority, three, of, galileo, s, five, siblings, survived, infancy, the, youngest, michelangelo, or, michelagnolo, also, became, a, lutenist, and, composer, who, added, to, galileo, s, financial, burdens, for, the, rest, of, his, life, michelangelo, was, unable, to, contribute, his, fair, share, of, their, father, s, promised, dowries, to, their, brothers, in, law, who, later, attempted, to, seek, legal, remedies, for, payments, due, michelangelo, also, occasionally, had, to, borrow, funds, from, galileo, to, support, his, musical, endeavours, and, excursions, these, financial, burdens, may, have, contributed, to, galileo, s, early, desire, to, develop, inventions, that, would, bring, him, additional, income, when, galileo, galilei, was, eight, his, family, moved, to, florence, but, he, was, left, under, the, care, of, muzio, tedaldi, for, two, years, when, galileo, was, ten, he, left, pisa, to, join, his, family, in, florence, where, he, came, under, the, tutelage, of, jacopo, borghini, he, was, educated, particularly, in, logic, from, 1575, to, 1578, in, the, vallombrosa, abbey, about, 30, km, southeast, of, florence, galileo, tended, to, refer, to, himself, only, by, his, first, name, at, the, time, surnames, were, optional, in, italy, and, his, first, name, had, the, same, origin, as, his, sometimes, family, name, galilei, both, his, given, and, family, name, ultimately, derived, from, an, ancestor, galileo, bonaiuti, an, important, physician, professor, and, politician, in, florence, in, the, 15th, century, galileo, bonaiuti, was, buried, in, the, same, church, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, in, florence, where, about, 200, years, later, galileo, galilei, was, also, buried, when, he, did, refer, to, himself, with, more, than, one, name, it, was, sometimes, as, galileo, galilei, linceo, a, reference, to, his, being, a, member, of, the, accademia, dei, lincei, an, elite, science, organization, founded, in, the, papal, states, it, was, common, for, mid, 16th, century, tuscan, families, to, name, the, eldest, son, after, the, parents, surname, hence, galileo, galilei, was, not, necessarily, named, after, his, ancestor, galileo, bonaiuti, the, italian, male, given, name, galileo, and, thence, the, surname, galilei, derives, from, the, latin, galilaeus, meaning, of, galilee, the, biblical, roots, of, galileo, s, name, and, surname, were, to, become, the, subject, of, a, famous, pun, in, 1614, during, the, galileo, affair, one, of, galileo, s, opponents, the, dominican, priest, tommaso, caccini, delivered, against, galileo, a, controversial, and, influential, sermon, in, it, he, made, a, point, of, quoting, acts, 1, 11, ye, men, of, galilee, why, stand, ye, gazing, up, into, heaven, despite, being, a, genuinely, pious, catholic, galileo, fathered, three, children, out, of, wedlock, with, marina, gamba, they, had, two, daughters, virginia, born, 1600, and, livia, born, 1601, and, a, son, vincenzo, born, 1606, due, to, their, illegitimate, birth, galileo, considered, the, girls, unmarriageable, if, not, posing, problems, of, prohibitively, expensive, support, or, dowries, which, would, have, been, similar, to, galileo, s, previous, extensive, financial, problems, with, two, of, his, sisters, their, only, worthy, alternative, was, the, religious, life, both, girls, were, accepted, by, the, convent, of, san, matteo, in, arcetri, and, remained, there, for, the, rest, of, their, lives, virginia, took, the, name, maria, celeste, upon, entering, the, convent, she, died, on, 2, april, 1634, and, is, buried, with, galileo, at, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, florence, livia, took, the, name, sister, arcangela, and, was, ill, for, most, of, her, life, vincenzo, was, later, legitimised, as, the, legal, heir, of, galileo, and, married, sestilia, bocchineri, although, galileo, seriously, considered, the, priesthood, as, a, young, man, at, his, father, s, urging, he, instead, enrolled, in, 1580, at, the, university, of, pisa, for, a, medical, degree, he, was, influenced, by, the, lectures, of, girolamo, borro, and, francesco, buonamici, of, florence, in, 1581, when, he, was, studying, medicine, he, noticed, a, swinging, chandelier, which, air, currents, shifted, about, to, swing, in, larger, and, smaller, arcs, to, him, it, seemed, by, comparison, with, his, heartbeat, that, the, chandelier, took, the, same, amount, of, time, to, swing, back, and, forth, no, matter, how, far, it, was, swinging, when, he, returned, home, he, set, up, two, pendulums, of, equal, length, and, swung, one, with, a, large, sweep, and, the, other, with, a, small, sweep, and, found, that, they, kept, time, together, it, was, not, until, the, work, of, christiaan, huygens, almost, one, hundred, years, later, that, the, tautochrone, nature, of, a, swinging, pendulum, was, used, to, create, an, accurate, timepiece, up, to, this, point, galileo, had, deliberately, been, kept, away, from, mathematics, since, a, physician, earned, a, higher, income, than, a, mathematician, however, after, accidentally, attending, a, lecture, on, geometry, he, talked, his, reluctant, father, into, letting, him, study, mathematics, and, natural, philosophy, instead, of, medicine, he, created, a, thermoscope, a, forerunner, of, the, thermometer, and, in, 1586, published, a, small, book, on, the, design, of, a, hydrostatic, balance, he, had, invented, which, first, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, the, scholarly, world, galileo, also, studied, disegno, a, term, encompassing, fine, art, and, in, 1588, obtained, the, position, of, instructor, in, the, accademia, delle, arti, del, disegno, in, florence, teaching, perspective, and, chiaroscuro, in, the, same, year, upon, invitation, by, the, florentine, academy, he, presented, two, lectures, on, the, shape, location, and, size, of, dante, s, inferno, in, an, attempt, to, propose, a, rigorous, cosmological, model, of, dante, s, hell, being, inspired, by, the, artistic, tradition, of, the, city, and, the, works, of, the, renaissance, artists, galileo, acquired, an, aesthetic, mentality, while, a, young, teacher, at, the, accademia, he, began, a, lifelong, friendship, with, the, florentine, painter, cigoli, in, 1589, he, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, mathematics, in, pisa, in, 1591, his, father, died, and, he, was, entrusted, with, the, care, of, his, younger, brother, michelagnolo, in, 1592, he, moved, to, the, university, of, padua, where, he, taught, geometry, mechanics, and, astronomy, until, 1610, during, this, period, galileo, made, significant, discoveries, in, both, pure, fundamental, science, for, example, kinematics, of, motion, and, astronomy, as, well, as, practical, applied, science, for, example, strength, of, materials, and, pioneering, the, telescope, his, multiple, interests, included, the, study, of, astrology, which, at, the, time, was, a, discipline, tied, to, the, studies, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, tycho, brahe, and, others, had, observed, the, supernova, of, 1572, ottavio, brenzoni, s, letter, of, 15, january, 1605, to, galileo, brought, the, 1572, supernova, and, the, less, bright, nova, of, 1601, to, galileo, s, notice, galileo, observed, and, discussed, kepler, s, supernova, in, 1604, since, these, new, stars, displayed, no, detectable, diurnal, parallax, galileo, concluded, that, they, were, distant, stars, and, therefore, disproved, the, aristotelian, belief, in, the, immutability, of, the, heavens, based, only, on, uncertain, descriptions, of, the, first, practical, telescope, which, hans, lippershey, tried, to, patent, in, the, netherlands, in, 1608, galileo, in, the, following, year, made, a, telescope, with, about, 3x, magnification, he, later, made, improved, versions, with, up, to, about, 30x, magnification, with, a, galilean, telescope, the, observer, could, see, magnified, upright, images, on, the, earth, it, was, what, is, commonly, known, as, a, terrestrial, telescope, or, a, spyglass, he, could, also, use, it, to, observe, the, sky, for, a, time, he, was, one, of, those, who, could, construct, telescopes, good, enough, for, that, purpose, on, 25, august, 1609, he, demonstrated, one, of, his, early, telescopes, with, a, magnification, of, about, 8, or, 9, to, venetian, lawmakers, his, telescopes, were, also, a, profitable, sideline, for, galileo, who, sold, them, to, merchants, who, found, them, useful, both, at, sea, and, as, items, of, trade, he, published, his, initial, telescopic, astronomical, observations, in, march, 1610, in, a, brief, treatise, entitled, sidereus, nuncius, starry, messenger, on, 30, november, 1609, galileo, aimed, his, telescope, at, the, moon, while, not, being, the, first, person, to, observe, the, moon, through, a, telescope, english, mathematician, thomas, harriot, had, done, so, four, months, before, but, only, saw, a, strange, spottednesse, galileo, was, the, first, to, deduce, the, cause, of, the, uneven, waning, as, light, occlusion, from, lunar, mountains, and, craters, in, his, study, he, also, made, topographical, charts, estimating, the, heights, of, the, mountains, the, moon, was, not, what, was, long, thought, to, have, been, a, translucent, and, perfect, sphere, as, aristotle, claimed, and, hardly, the, first, planet, an, eternal, pearl, to, magnificently, ascend, into, the, heavenly, empyrian, as, put, forth, by, dante, galileo, is, sometimes, credited, with, the, discovery, of, the, lunar, libration, in, latitude, in, 1632, although, thomas, harriot, or, william, gilbert, may, have, done, so, before, the, painter, cigoli, a, friend, of, galileo, included, a, realistic, depiction, of, the, moon, in, one, of, his, paintings, he, probably, used, his, own, telescope, to, make, the, observation, on, 7, january, 1610, galileo, observed, with, his, telescope, what, he, described, at, the, time, as, three, fixed, stars, totally, invisible, by, their, smallness, all, close, to, jupiter, and, lying, on, a, straight, line, through, it, observations, on, subsequent, nights, showed, that, the, positions, of, these, stars, relative, to, jupiter, were, changing, in, a, way, that, would, have, been, inexplicable, if, they, had, really, been, fixed, stars, on, 10, january, galileo, noted, that, one, of, them, had, disappeared, an, observation, which, he, attributed, to, its, being, hidden, behind, jupiter, within, a, few, days, he, concluded, that, they, were, orbiting, jupiter, he, had, discovered, three, of, jupiter, s, four, largest, moons, he, discovered, the, fourth, on, 13, january, galileo, named, the, group, of, four, the, medicean, stars, in, honour, of, his, future, patron, cosimo, ii, de, medici, grand, duke, of, tuscany, and, cosimo, s, three, brothers, later, astronomers, however, renamed, them, galilean, satellites, in, honour, of, their, discoverer, these, satellites, were, independently, discovered, by, simon, marius, on, 8, january, 1610, and, are, now, called, io, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, the, names, given, by, marius, in, his, mundus, iovialis, published, in, 1614, galileo, s, observations, of, the, satellites, of, jupiter, caused, controversy, in, astronomy, a, planet, with, smaller, planets, orbiting, it, did, not, conform, to, the, principles, of, aristotelian, cosmology, which, held, that, all, heavenly, bodies, should, circle, the, earth, and, many, astronomers, and, philosophers, initially, refused, to, believe, that, galileo, could, have, discovered, such, a, thing, compounding, this, problem, other, astronomers, had, difficulty, confirming, galileo, s, observations, when, he, demonstrated, the, telescope, in, bologna, the, attendees, struggled, to, see, the, moons, one, of, them, martin, horky, noted, that, some, fixed, stars, such, as, spica, virginis, appeared, double, through, the, telescope, he, took, this, as, evidence, that, the, instrument, was, deceptive, when, viewing, the, heavens, casting, doubt, on, the, existence, of, the, moons, christopher, clavius, s, observatory, in, rome, confirmed, the, observations, and, although, unsure, how, to, interpret, them, gave, galileo, a, hero, s, welcome, when, he, visited, the, next, year, galileo, continued, to, observe, the, satellites, over, the, next, eighteen, months, and, by, mid, 1611, he, had, obtained, remarkably, accurate, estimates, for, their, periods, a, feat, which, johannes, kepler, had, believed, impossible, galileo, saw, a, practical, use, for, his, discovery, determining, the, east, west, position, of, ships, at, sea, required, their, clocks, be, synchronized, with, clocks, at, the, prime, meridian, solving, this, longitude, problem, had, great, importance, to, safe, navigation, and, large, prizes, were, established, by, spain, and, later, holland, for, its, solution, since, eclipses, of, the, moons, he, discovered, were, relatively, frequent, and, their, times, could, be, predicted, with, great, accuracy, they, could, be, used, to, set, shipboard, clocks, and, galileo, applied, for, the, prizes, observing, the, moons, from, a, ship, proved, too, difficult, but, the, method, was, used, for, land, surveys, including, the, remapping, of, france, 15, 16, from, september, 1610, galileo, observed, that, venus, exhibits, a, full, set, of, phases, similar, to, that, of, the, moon, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, developed, by, nicolaus, copernicus, predicted, that, all, phases, would, be, visible, since, the, orbit, of, venus, around, the, sun, would, cause, its, illuminated, hemisphere, to, face, the, earth, when, it, was, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sun, and, to, face, away, from, the, earth, when, it, was, on, the, earth, side, of, the, sun, in, ptolemy, s, geocentric, model, it, was, impossible, for, any, of, the, planets, orbits, to, intersect, the, spherical, shell, carrying, the, sun, traditionally, the, orbit, of, venus, was, placed, entirely, on, the, near, side, of, the, sun, where, it, could, exhibit, only, crescent, and, new, phases, it, was, also, possible, to, place, it, entirely, on, the, far, side, of, the, sun, where, it, could, exhibit, only, gibbous, and, full, phases, after, galileo, s, telescopic, observations, of, the, crescent, gibbous, and, full, phases, of, venus, the, ptolemaic, model, became, untenable, in, the, early, 17th, century, as, a, result, of, his, discovery, the, great, majority, of, astronomers, converted, to, one, of, the, various, geo, heliocentric, planetary, models, such, as, the, tychonic, capellan, and, extended, capellan, models, each, either, with, or, without, a, daily, rotating, earth, these, all, explained, the, phases, of, venus, without, the, refutation, of, full, heliocentrism, s, prediction, of, stellar, parallax, galileo, s, discovery, of, the, phases, of, venus, was, thus, his, most, empirically, practically, influential, contribution, to, the, two, stage, transition, from, full, geocentrism, to, full, heliocentrism, via, geo, heliocentrism, in, 1610, galileo, also, observed, the, planet, saturn, and, at, first, mistook, its, rings, for, planets, thinking, it, was, a, three, bodied, system, when, he, observed, the, planet, later, saturn, s, rings, were, directly, oriented, to, earth, causing, him, to, think, that, two, of, the, bodies, had, disappeared, the, rings, reappeared, when, he, observed, the, planet, in, 1616, further, confusing, him, galileo, observed, the, planet, neptune, in, 1612, it, appears, in, his, notebooks, as, one, of, many, unremarkable, dim, stars, he, did, not, realise, that, it, was, a, planet, but, he, did, note, its, motion, relative, to, the, stars, before, losing, track, of, it, galileo, made, naked, eye, and, telescopic, studies, of, sunspots, their, existence, raised, another, difficulty, with, the, unchanging, perfection, of, the, heavens, as, posited, in, orthodox, aristotelian, celestial, physics, an, apparent, annual, variation, in, their, trajectories, observed, by, francesco, sizzi, and, others, in, 1612, 1613, also, provided, a, powerful, argument, against, both, the, ptolemaic, system, and, the, geoheliocentric, system, of, tycho, brahe, a, dispute, over, claimed, priority, in, the, discovery, of, sunspots, and, in, their, interpretation, led, galileo, to, a, long, and, bitter, feud, with, the, jesuit, christoph, scheiner, in, the, middle, was, mark, welser, to, whom, scheiner, had, announced, his, discovery, and, who, asked, galileo, for, his, opinion, both, of, them, were, unaware, of, johannes, fabricius, earlier, observation, and, publication, of, sunspots, galileo, observed, the, milky, way, previously, believed, to, be, nebulous, and, found, it, to, be, a, multitude, of, stars, packed, so, densely, that, they, appeared, from, earth, to, be, clouds, he, located, many, other, stars, too, distant, to, be, visible, to, the, naked, eye, he, observed, the, double, star, mizar, in, ursa, major, in, 1617, in, the, starry, messenger, galileo, reported, that, stars, appeared, as, mere, blazes, of, light, essentially, unaltered, in, appearance, by, the, telescope, and, contrasted, them, to, planets, which, the, telescope, revealed, to, be, discs, but, shortly, thereafter, in, his, letters, on, sunspots, he, reported, that, the, telescope, revealed, the, shapes, of, both, stars, and, planets, to, be, quite, round, from, that, point, forward, he, continued, to, report, that, telescopes, showed, the, roundness, of, stars, and, that, stars, seen, through, the, telescope, measured, a, few, seconds, of, arc, in, diameter, he, also, devised, a, method, for, measuring, the, apparent, size, of, a, star, without, a, telescope, as, described, in, his, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, his, method, was, to, hang, a, thin, rope, in, his, line, of, sight, to, the, star, and, measure, the, maximum, distance, from, which, it, would, wholly, obscure, the, star, from, his, measurements, of, this, distance, and, of, the, width, of, the, rope, he, could, calculate, the, angle, subtended, by, the, star, at, his, viewing, point, in, his, dialogue, he, reported, that, he, had, found, the, apparent, diameter, of, a, star, of, first, magnitude, to, be, no, more, than, 5, arcseconds, and, that, of, one, of, sixth, magnitude, to, be, about, 5, 6, arcseconds, like, most, astronomers, of, his, day, galileo, did, not, recognise, that, the, apparent, sizes, of, stars, that, he, measured, were, spurious, caused, by, diffraction, and, atmospheric, distortion, and, did, not, represent, the, true, sizes, of, stars, however, galileo, s, values, were, much, smaller, than, previous, estimates, of, the, apparent, sizes, of, the, brightest, stars, such, as, those, made, by, brahe, and, enabled, galileo, to, counter, anti, copernican, arguments, such, as, those, made, by, tycho, that, these, stars, would, have, to, be, absurdly, large, for, their, annual, parallaxes, to, be, undetectable, other, astronomers, such, as, simon, marius, giovanni, battista, riccioli, and, martinus, hortensius, made, similar, measurements, of, stars, and, marius, and, riccioli, concluded, the, smaller, sizes, were, not, small, enough, to, answer, tycho, s, argument, cardinal, bellarmine, had, written, in, 1615, that, the, copernican, system, could, not, be, defended, without, a, true, physical, demonstration, that, the, sun, does, not, circle, the, earth, but, the, earth, circles, the, sun, galileo, considered, his, theory, of, the, tides, to, provide, such, evidence, this, theory, was, so, important, to, him, that, he, originally, intended, to, call, his, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, the, dialogue, on, the, ebb, and, flow, of, the, sea, the, reference, to, tides, was, removed, from, the, title, by, order, of, the, inquisition, for, galileo, the, tides, were, caused, by, the, sloshing, back, and, forth, of, water, in, the, seas, as, a, point, on, the, earth, s, surface, sped, up, and, slowed, down, because, of, the, earth, s, rotation, on, its, axis, and, revolution, around, the, sun, he, circulated, his, first, account, of, the, tides, in, 1616, addressed, to, cardinal, orsini, his, theory, gave, the, first, insight, into, the, importance, of, the, shapes, of, ocean, basins, in, the, size, and, timing, of, tides, he, correctly, accounted, for, instance, for, the, negligible, tides, halfway, along, the, adriatic, sea, compared, to, those, at, the, ends, as, a, general, account, of, the, cause, of, tides, however, his, theory, was, a, failure, if, this, theory, were, correct, there, would, be, only, one, high, tide, per, day, galileo, and, his, contemporaries, were, aware, of, this, inadequacy, because, there, are, two, daily, high, tides, at, venice, instead, of, one, about, 12, hours, apart, galileo, dismissed, this, anomaly, as, the, result, of, several, secondary, causes, including, the, shape, of, the, sea, its, depth, and, other, factors, albert, einstein, later, expressed, the, opinion, that, galileo, developed, his, fascinating, arguments, and, accepted, them, uncritically, out, of, a, desire, for, physical, proof, of, the, motion, of, the, earth, galileo, also, dismissed, the, idea, known, from, antiquity, and, by, his, contemporary, johannes, kepler, that, the, moon, caused, the, tides, galileo, also, took, no, interest, in, kepler, s, elliptical, orbits, of, the, planets, galileo, continued, to, argue, in, favour, of, his, theory, of, tides, considering, it, the, ultimate, proof, of, earth, s, motion, in, 1619, galileo, became, embroiled, in, a, controversy, with, father, orazio, grassi, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, jesuit, collegio, romano, it, began, as, a, dispute, over, the, nature, of, comets, but, by, the, time, galileo, had, published, the, assayer, il, saggiatore, in, 1623, his, last, salvo, in, the, dispute, it, had, become, a, much, wider, controversy, over, the, very, nature, of, science, itself, the, title, page, of, the, book, describes, galileo, as, a, philosopher, and, matematico, primario, of, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, because, the, assayer, contains, such, a, wealth, of, galileo, s, ideas, on, how, science, should, be, practised, it, has, been, referred, to, as, his, scientific, manifesto, early, in, 1619, father, grassi, had, anonymously, published, a, pamphlet, an, astronomical, disputation, on, the, three, comets, of, the, year, 1618, which, discussed, the, nature, of, a, comet, that, had, appeared, late, in, november, of, the, previous, year, grassi, concluded, that, the, comet, was, a, fiery, body, that, had, moved, along, a, segment, of, a, great, circle, at, a, constant, distance, from, the, earth, and, since, it, moved, in, the, sky, more, slowly, than, the, moon, it, must, be, farther, away, than, the, moon, grassi, s, arguments, and, conclusions, were, criticised, in, a, subsequent, article, discourse, on, comets, published, under, the, name, of, one, of, galileo, s, disciples, a, florentine, lawyer, named, mario, guiducci, although, it, had, been, largely, written, by, galileo, himself, galileo, and, guiducci, offered, no, definitive, theory, of, their, own, on, the, nature, of, comets, although, they, did, present, some, tentative, conjectures, that, are, now, known, to, be, mistaken, the, correct, approach, to, the, study, of, comets, had, been, proposed, at, the, time, by, tycho, brahe, in, its, opening, passage, galileo, and, guiducci, s, discourse, gratuitously, insulted, the, jesuit, christoph, scheiner, and, various, uncomplimentary, remarks, about, the, professors, of, the, collegio, romano, were, scattered, throughout, the, work, the, jesuits, were, offended, and, grassi, soon, replied, with, a, polemical, tract, of, his, own, the, astronomical, and, philosophical, balance, under, the, pseudonym, lothario, sarsio, sigensano, purporting, to, be, one, of, his, own, pupils, the, assayer, was, galileo, s, devastating, reply, to, the, astronomical, balance, it, has, been, widely, recognized, as, a, masterpiece, of, polemical, literature, in, which, sarsi, s, arguments, are, subjected, to, withering, scorn, it, was, greeted, with, wide, acclaim, and, particularly, pleased, the, new, pope, urban, viii, to, whom, it, had, been, dedicated, in, rome, in, the, previous, decade, barberini, the, future, urban, viii, had, come, down, on, the, side, of, galileo, and, the, lincean, academy, galileo, s, dispute, with, grassi, permanently, alienated, many, jesuits, and, galileo, and, his, friends, were, convinced, that, they, were, responsible, for, bringing, about, his, later, condemnation, although, supporting, evidence, for, this, is, not, conclusive, at, the, time, of, galileo, s, conflict, with, the, church, the, majority, of, educated, people, subscribed, to, the, aristotelian, geocentric, view, that, the, earth, is, the, centre, of, the, universe, and, the, orbit, of, all, heavenly, bodies, or, tycho, brahe, s, new, system, blending, geocentrism, with, heliocentrism, opposition, to, heliocentrism, and, galileo, s, writings, on, it, combined, religious, and, scientific, objections, religious, opposition, to, heliocentrism, arose, from, biblical, passages, implying, the, fixed, nature, of, the, earth, scientific, opposition, came, from, brahe, who, argued, that, if, heliocentrism, were, true, an, annual, stellar, parallax, should, be, observed, though, none, was, at, the, time, aristarchus, and, copernicus, had, correctly, postulated, that, parallax, was, negligible, because, the, stars, were, so, distant, however, tycho, countered, that, since, stars, appear, to, have, measurable, angular, size, if, the, stars, were, that, distant, and, their, apparent, size, is, due, to, their, physical, size, they, would, be, far, larger, than, the, sun, in, fact, it, is, not, possible, to, observe, the, physical, size, of, distant, stars, without, modern, telescopes, galileo, defended, heliocentrism, based, on, his, astronomical, observations, of, 1609, in, december, 1613, the, grand, duchess, christina, of, florence, confronted, one, of, galileo, s, friends, and, followers, benedetto, castelli, with, biblical, objections, to, the, motion, of, the, earth, prompted, by, this, incident, galileo, wrote, a, letter, to, castelli, in, which, he, argued, that, heliocentrism, was, actually, not, contrary, to, biblical, texts, and, that, the, bible, was, an, authority, on, faith, and, morals, not, science, this, letter, was, not, published, but, circulated, widely, two, years, later, galileo, wrote, a, letter, to, christina, that, expanded, his, arguments, previously, made, in, eight, pages, to, forty, pages, by, 1615, galileo, s, writings, on, heliocentrism, had, been, submitted, to, the, roman, inquisition, by, father, niccol, lorini, who, claimed, that, galileo, and, his, followers, were, attempting, to, reinterpret, the, bible, which, was, seen, as, a, violation, of, the, council, of, trent, and, looked, dangerously, like, protestantism, lorini, specifically, cited, galileo, s, letter, to, castelli, galileo, went, to, rome, to, defend, himself, and, his, ideas, at, the, start, of, 1616, francesco, ingoli, initiated, a, debate, with, galileo, sending, him, an, essay, disputing, the, copernican, system, galileo, later, stated, that, he, believed, this, essay, to, have, been, instrumental, in, the, action, against, copernicanism, that, followed, ingoli, may, have, been, commissioned, by, the, inquisition, to, write, an, expert, opinion, on, the, controversy, with, the, essay, providing, the, basis, for, the, inquisition, s, actions, the, essay, focused, on, eighteen, physical, and, mathematical, arguments, against, heliocentrism, it, borrowed, primarily, from, tycho, brahe, s, arguments, notably, that, heliocentrism, would, require, the, stars, as, they, appeared, to, be, much, larger, than, the, sun, the, essay, also, included, four, theological, arguments, but, ingoli, suggested, galileo, focus, on, the, physical, and, mathematical, arguments, and, he, did, not, mention, galileo, s, biblical, ideas, in, february, 1616, an, inquisitorial, commission, declared, heliocentrism, to, be, foolish, and, absurd, in, philosophy, and, formally, heretical, since, it, explicitly, contradicts, in, many, places, the, sense, of, holy, scripture, the, inquisition, found, that, the, idea, of, the, earth, s, movement, receives, the, same, judgement, in, philosophy, and, in, regard, to, theological, truth, it, is, at, least, erroneous, in, faith, pope, paul, v, instructed, cardinal, bellarmine, to, deliver, this, finding, to, galileo, and, to, order, him, to, abandon, heliocentrism, on, 26, february, galileo, was, called, to, bellarmine, s, residence, and, ordered, to, abandon, completely, the, opinion, that, the, sun, stands, still, at, the, centre, of, the, world, and, the, earth, moves, and, henceforth, not, to, hold, teach, or, defend, it, in, any, way, whatever, either, orally, or, in, writing, the, decree, of, the, congregation, of, the, index, banned, copernicus, s, de, revolutionibus, and, other, heliocentric, works, until, correction, for, the, next, decade, galileo, stayed, well, away, from, the, controversy, he, revived, his, project, of, writing, a, book, on, the, subject, encouraged, by, the, election, of, cardinal, maffeo, barberini, as, pope, urban, viii, in, 1623, barberini, was, a, friend, and, admirer, of, galileo, and, had, opposed, the, admonition, of, galileo, in, 1616, galileo, s, resulting, book, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, was, published, in, 1632, with, formal, authorization, from, the, inquisition, and, papal, permission, earlier, pope, urban, viii, had, personally, asked, galileo, to, give, arguments, for, and, against, heliocentrism, in, the, book, and, to, be, careful, not, to, advocate, heliocentrism, whether, unknowingly, or, deliberately, simplicio, the, defender, of, the, aristotelian, geocentric, view, in, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, was, often, caught, in, his, own, errors, and, sometimes, came, across, as, a, fool, indeed, although, galileo, states, in, the, preface, of, his, book, that, the, character, is, named, after, a, famous, aristotelian, philosopher, simplicius, in, latin, simplicio, in, italian, the, name, simplicio, in, italian, also, has, the, connotation, of, simpleton, this, portrayal, of, simplicio, made, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, appear, as, an, advocacy, book, an, attack, on, aristotelian, geocentrism, and, defence, of, the, copernican, theory, most, historians, agree, galileo, did, not, act, out, of, malice, and, felt, blindsided, by, the, reaction, to, his, book, however, the, pope, did, not, take, the, suspected, public, ridicule, lightly, nor, the, copernican, advocacy, galileo, had, alienated, one, of, his, biggest, and, most, powerful, supporters, the, pope, and, was, called, to, rome, to, defend, his, writings, in, september, 1632, he, finally, arrived, in, february, 1633, and, was, brought, before, inquisitor, vincenzo, maculani, to, be, charged, throughout, his, trial, galileo, steadfastly, maintained, that, since, 1616, he, had, faithfully, kept, his, promise, not, to, hold, any, of, the, condemned, opinions, and, initially, he, denied, even, defending, them, however, he, was, eventually, persuaded, to, admit, that, contrary, to, his, true, intention, a, reader, of, his, dialogue, could, well, have, obtained, the, impression, that, it, was, intended, to, be, a, defence, of, copernicanism, in, view, of, galileo, s, rather, implausible, denial, that, he, had, ever, held, copernican, ideas, after, 1616, or, ever, intended, to, defend, them, in, the, dialogue, his, final, interrogation, in, july, 1633, concluded, with, his, being, threatened, with, torture, if, he, did, not, tell, the, truth, but, he, maintained, his, denial, despite, the, threat, the, sentence, of, the, inquisition, was, delivered, on, 22, june, it, was, in, three, essential, parts, according, to, popular, legend, after, recanting, his, theory, that, the, earth, moved, around, the, sun, galileo, allegedly, muttered, the, rebellious, phrase, and, yet, it, moves, there, was, a, claim, that, a, 1640s, painting, by, the, spanish, painter, bartolom, esteban, murillo, or, an, artist, of, his, school, in, which, the, words, were, hidden, until, restoration, work, in, 1911, depicts, an, imprisoned, galileo, apparently, gazing, at, the, words, e, pur, si, muove, written, on, the, wall, of, his, dungeon, the, earliest, known, written, account, of, the, legend, dates, to, a, century, after, his, death, based, on, the, painting, stillman, drake, wrote, there, is, no, doubt, now, that, the, famous, words, were, already, attributed, to, galileo, before, his, death, however, an, intensive, investigation, by, astrophysicist, mario, livio, has, revealed, that, said, painting, is, most, probably, a, copy, of, an, 1837, painting, by, the, flemish, painter, roman, eugene, van, maldeghem, after, a, period, with, the, friendly, ascanio, piccolomini, the, archbishop, of, siena, galileo, was, allowed, to, return, to, his, villa, at, arcetri, near, florence, in, 1634, where, he, spent, part, of, his, life, under, house, arrest, galileo, was, ordered, to, read, the, seven, penitential, psalms, once, a, week, for, the, next, three, years, however, his, daughter, maria, celeste, relieved, him, of, the, burden, after, securing, ecclesiastical, permission, to, take, it, upon, herself, it, was, while, galileo, was, under, house, arrest, that, he, dedicated, his, time, to, one, of, his, finest, works, two, new, sciences, here, he, summarised, work, he, had, done, some, forty, years, earlier, on, the, two, sciences, now, called, kinematics, and, strength, of, materials, published, in, holland, to, avoid, the, censor, this, book, was, highly, praised, by, albert, einstein, as, a, result, of, this, work, galileo, is, often, called, the, father, of, modern, physics, he, went, completely, blind, in, 1638, and, developed, a, painful, hernia, and, insomnia, so, he, was, permitted, to, travel, to, florence, for, medical, advice, dava, sobel, argues, that, prior, to, galileo, s, 1633, trial, and, judgement, for, heresy, pope, urban, viii, had, become, preoccupied, with, court, intrigue, and, problems, of, state, and, began, to, fear, persecution, or, threats, to, his, own, life, in, this, context, sobel, argues, that, the, problem, of, galileo, was, presented, to, the, pope, by, court, insiders, and, enemies, of, galileo, having, been, accused, of, weakness, in, defending, the, church, urban, reacted, against, galileo, out, of, anger, and, fear, mario, livio, places, galileo, and, his, discoveries, in, modern, scientific, and, social, contexts, in, particular, he, argues, that, the, galileo, affair, has, its, counterpart, in, science, denial, galileo, continued, to, receive, visitors, until, his, death, on, 8, january, 1642, aged, 77, following, a, fever, and, heart, palpitations, the, grand, duke, of, tuscany, ferdinando, ii, wished, to, bury, him, in, the, main, body, of, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, next, to, the, tombs, of, his, father, and, other, ancestors, and, to, erect, a, marble, mausoleum, in, his, honour, these, plans, were, dropped, however, after, pope, urban, viii, and, his, nephew, cardinal, francesco, barberini, protested, because, galileo, had, been, condemned, by, the, catholic, church, for, vehement, suspicion, of, heresy, he, was, instead, buried, in, a, small, room, next, to, the, novices, chapel, at, the, end, of, a, corridor, from, the, southern, transept, of, the, basilica, to, the, sacristy, he, was, reburied, in, the, main, body, of, the, basilica, in, 1737, after, a, monument, had, been, erected, there, in, his, honour, during, this, move, three, fingers, and, a, tooth, were, removed, from, his, remains, one, of, these, fingers, is, currently, on, exhibition, at, the, museo, galileo, in, florence, italy, this, and, other, facts, not, few, in, number, or, less, worth, knowing, i, have, succeeded, in, proving, and, what, i, consider, more, important, there, have, been, opened, up, to, this, vast, and, most, excellent, science, of, which, my, work, is, merely, the, beginning, ways, and, means, by, which, other, minds, more, acute, than, mine, will, explore, its, remote, corners, galileo, made, original, contributions, to, the, science, of, motion, through, an, innovative, combination, of, experiments, and, mathematics, more, typical, of, science, at, the, time, were, the, qualitative, studies, of, william, gilbert, on, magnetism, and, electricity, galileo, s, father, vincenzo, galilei, a, lutenist, and, music, theorist, had, performed, experiments, establishing, perhaps, the, oldest, known, non, linear, relation, in, physics, for, a, stretched, string, the, pitch, varies, as, the, square, root, of, the, tension, these, observations, lay, within, the, framework, of, the, pythagorean, tradition, of, music, well, known, to, instrument, makers, which, included, the, fact, that, subdividing, a, string, by, a, whole, number, produces, a, harmonious, scale, thus, a, limited, amount, of, mathematics, had, long, related, to, music, and, physical, science, and, young, galileo, could, see, his, own, father, s, observations, expand, on, that, tradition, galileo, was, one, of, the, first, modern, thinkers, to, clearly, state, that, the, laws, of, nature, are, mathematical, in, the, assayer, he, wrote, philosophy, is, written, in, this, grand, book, the, universe, it, is, written, in, the, language, of, mathematics, and, its, characters, are, triangles, circles, and, other, geometric, figures, his, mathematical, analyses, are, a, further, development, of, a, tradition, employed, by, late, scholastic, natural, philosophers, which, galileo, learned, when, he, studied, philosophy, his, work, marked, another, step, towards, the, eventual, separation, of, science, from, both, philosophy, and, religion, a, major, development, in, human, thought, he, was, often, willing, to, change, his, views, in, accordance, with, observation, in, order, to, perform, his, experiments, galileo, had, to, set, up, standards, of, length, and, time, so, that, measurements, made, on, different, days, and, in, different, laboratories, could, be, compared, in, a, reproducible, fashion, this, provided, a, reliable, foundation, on, which, to, confirm, mathematical, laws, using, inductive, reasoning, galileo, showed, a, modern, appreciation, for, the, proper, relationship, between, mathematics, theoretical, physics, and, experimental, physics, he, understood, the, parabola, both, in, terms, of, conic, sections, and, in, terms, of, the, ordinate, y, varying, as, the, square, of, the, abscissa, x, galileo, further, asserted, that, the, parabola, was, the, theoretically, ideal, trajectory, of, a, uniformly, accelerated, projectile, in, the, absence, of, air, resistance, or, other, disturbances, he, conceded, that, there, are, limits, to, the, validity, of, this, theory, noting, on, theoretical, grounds, that, a, projectile, trajectory, of, a, size, comparable, to, that, of, the, earth, could, not, possibly, be, a, parabola, but, he, nevertheless, maintained, that, for, distances, up, to, the, range, of, the, artillery, of, his, day, the, deviation, of, a, projectile, s, trajectory, from, a, parabola, would, be, only, very, slight, using, his, refracting, telescope, galileo, observed, in, late, 1609, that, the, surface, of, the, moon, is, not, smooth, early, the, next, year, he, observed, the, four, largest, moons, of, jupiter, later, in, 1610, he, observed, the, phases, of, venus, a, proof, of, heliocentrism, as, well, as, saturn, though, he, thought, the, planet, s, rings, were, two, other, planets, in, 1612, he, observed, neptune, and, noted, its, motion, but, did, not, identify, it, as, a, planet, galileo, made, studies, of, sunspots, the, milky, way, and, made, various, observations, about, stars, including, how, to, measure, their, apparent, size, without, a, telescope, he, coined, the, term, aurora, borealis, in, 1619, from, the, roman, goddess, of, the, dawn, and, the, greek, name, for, the, north, wind, to, describe, lights, in, the, northern, and, southern, sky, when, particles, from, the, solar, wind, energise, the, magnetosphere, galileo, made, a, number, of, contributions, to, what, is, now, known, as, engineering, as, distinct, from, pure, physics, between, 1595, and, 1598, galileo, devised, and, improved, a, geometric, and, military, compass, suitable, for, use, by, gunners, and, surveyors, this, expanded, on, earlier, instruments, designed, by, niccol, tartaglia, and, guidobaldo, del, monte, for, gunners, it, offered, in, addition, to, a, new, and, safer, way, of, elevating, cannons, accurately, a, way, of, quickly, computing, the, charge, of, gunpowder, for, cannonballs, of, different, sizes, and, materials, as, a, geometric, instrument, it, enabled, the, construction, of, any, regular, polygon, computation, of, the, area, of, any, polygon, or, circular, sector, and, a, variety, of, other, calculations, under, galileo, s, direction, instrument, maker, marc, antonio, mazzoleni, produced, more, than, 100, of, these, compasses, which, galileo, sold, along, with, an, instruction, manual, he, wrote, for, 50, lire, and, offered, a, course, of, instruction, in, the, use, of, the, compasses, for, 120, lire, in, 1593, galileo, constructed, a, thermometer, using, the, expansion, and, contraction, of, air, in, a, bulb, to, move, water, in, an, attached, tube, in, 1609, galileo, was, along, with, englishman, thomas, harriot, and, others, among, the, first, to, use, a, refracting, telescope, as, an, instrument, to, observe, stars, planets, or, moons, the, name, telescope, was, coined, for, galileo, s, instrument, by, a, greek, mathematician, giovanni, demisiani, at, a, banquet, held, in, 1611, by, prince, federico, cesi, to, make, galileo, a, member, of, his, accademia, dei, lincei, in, 1610, he, used, a, telescope, at, close, range, to, magnify, the, parts, of, insects, by, 1624, galileo, had, used, a, compound, microscope, he, gave, one, of, these, instruments, to, cardinal, zollern, in, may, of, that, year, for, presentation, to, the, duke, of, bavaria, and, in, september, he, sent, another, to, prince, cesi, the, linceans, played, a, role, again, in, naming, the, microscope, a, year, later, when, fellow, academy, member, giovanni, faber, coined, the, word, for, galileo, s, invention, from, the, greek, words, micron, meaning, small, and, skopein, meaning, to, look, at, the, word, was, meant, to, be, analogous, with, telescope, illustrations, of, insects, made, using, one, of, galileo, s, microscopes, and, published, in, 1625, appear, to, have, been, the, first, clear, documentation, of, the, use, of, a, compound, microscope, in, 1612, having, determined, the, orbital, periods, of, jupiter, s, satellites, galileo, proposed, that, with, sufficiently, accurate, knowledge, of, their, orbits, one, could, use, their, positions, as, a, universal, clock, and, this, would, make, possible, the, determination, of, longitude, he, worked, on, this, problem, from, time, to, time, during, the, remainder, of, his, life, but, the, practical, problems, were, severe, the, method, was, first, successfully, applied, by, giovanni, domenico, cassini, in, 1681, and, was, later, used, extensively, for, large, land, surveys, this, method, for, example, was, used, to, survey, france, and, later, by, zebulon, pike, of, the, midwestern, united, states, in, 1806, for, sea, navigation, where, delicate, telescopic, observations, were, more, difficult, the, longitude, problem, eventually, required, the, development, of, a, practical, portable, marine, chronometer, such, as, that, of, john, harrison, late, in, his, life, when, totally, blind, galileo, designed, an, escapement, mechanism, for, a, pendulum, clock, called, galileo, s, escapement, although, no, clock, using, this, was, built, until, after, the, first, fully, operational, pendulum, clock, was, made, by, christiaan, huygens, in, the, 1650s, galileo, was, invited, on, several, occasions, to, advise, on, engineering, schemes, to, alleviate, river, flooding, in, 1630, mario, guiducci, was, probably, instrumental, in, ensuring, that, he, was, consulted, on, a, scheme, by, bartolotti, to, cut, a, new, channel, for, the, bisenzio, river, near, florence, an, issue, with, simple, ball, bearings, is, that, the, balls, rub, against, each, other, causing, additional, friction, this, can, be, reduced, by, enclosing, each, individual, ball, within, a, cage, the, captured, or, caged, ball, bearing, was, originally, described, by, galileo, in, the, 17th, century, galileo, s, theoretical, and, experimental, work, on, the, motions, of, bodies, along, with, the, largely, independent, work, of, kepler, and, ren, descartes, was, a, precursor, of, the, classical, mechanics, developed, by, sir, isaac, newton, galileo, conducted, several, experiments, with, pendulums, it, is, popularly, believed, thanks, to, the, biography, by, vincenzo, viviani, that, these, began, by, watching, the, swings, of, the, bronze, chandelier, in, the, cathedral, of, pisa, using, his, pulse, as, a, timer, the, first, recorded, interest, in, pendulums, made, by, galileo, was, in, his, posthumously, published, notes, titled, on, motion, but, later, experiments, are, described, in, his, two, new, sciences, galileo, claimed, that, a, simple, pendulum, is, isochronous, i, e, that, its, swings, always, take, the, same, amount, of, time, independently, of, the, amplitude, in, fact, this, is, only, approximately, true, as, was, discovered, by, christiaan, huygens, galileo, also, found, that, the, square, of, the, period, varies, directly, with, the, length, of, the, pendulum, galileo, is, lesser, known, for, yet, still, credited, with, being, one, of, the, first, to, understand, sound, frequency, by, scraping, a, chisel, at, different, speeds, he, linked, the, pitch, of, the, sound, produced, to, the, spacing, of, the, chisel, s, skips, a, measure, of, frequency, by, the, 17th, century, water, pump, designs, had, improved, to, the, point, that, they, produced, measurable, vacuums, but, this, was, not, immediately, understood, what, was, known, was, that, suction, pumps, could, not, pull, water, beyond, a, certain, height, 18, florentine, yards, according, to, a, measurement, taken, around, 1635, or, about, 34, feet, 10, m, this, limit, was, a, concern, in, irrigation, projects, mine, drainage, and, decorative, water, fountains, planned, by, the, duke, of, tuscany, so, the, duke, commissioned, galileo, to, investigate, the, problem, in, his, two, new, sciences, 1638, galileo, suggested, incorrectly, that, the, column, of, water, pulled, up, by, a, water, pump, would, break, of, its, own, weight, once, reaching, beyond, 34, feet, in, 1638, galileo, described, an, experimental, method, to, measure, the, speed, of, light, by, arranging, that, two, observers, each, having, lanterns, equipped, with, shutters, observe, each, other, s, lanterns, at, some, distance, the, first, observer, opens, the, shutter, of, his, lamp, and, the, second, upon, seeing, the, light, immediately, opens, the, shutter, of, his, own, lantern, the, time, between, the, first, observer, s, opening, his, shutter, and, seeing, the, light, from, the, second, observer, s, lamp, indicates, the, time, it, takes, light, to, travel, back, and, forth, between, the, two, observers, galileo, reported, that, when, he, tried, this, at, a, distance, of, less, than, a, mile, he, was, unable, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, light, appeared, instantaneously, sometime, between, galileo, s, death, and, 1667, the, members, of, the, florentine, accademia, del, cimento, repeated, the, experiment, over, a, distance, of, about, a, mile, and, obtained, a, similarly, inconclusive, result, the, speed, of, light, has, since, been, determined, to, be, far, too, fast, to, be, measured, by, such, methods, galileo, put, forward, the, basic, principle, of, relativity, that, the, laws, of, physics, are, the, same, in, any, system, that, is, moving, at, a, constant, speed, in, a, straight, line, regardless, of, its, particular, speed, or, direction, hence, there, is, no, absolute, motion, or, absolute, rest, this, principle, provided, the, basic, framework, for, newton, s, laws, of, motion, and, is, central, to, einstein, s, special, theory, of, relativity, that, unequal, weights, would, fall, with, the, same, speed, may, have, been, proposed, as, early, as, by, the, roman, philosopher, lucretius, observations, that, similarly, sized, objects, of, different, weights, fall, at, the, same, speed, are, documented, in, sixth, century, works, by, john, philoponus, which, galileo, was, aware, of, in, the, 14th, century, nicole, oresme, had, derived, the, time, squared, law, for, uniformly, accelerated, change, and, in, the, 16th, century, domingo, de, soto, had, suggested, that, bodies, falling, through, a, homogeneous, medium, would, be, uniformly, accelerated, de, soto, however, did, not, anticipate, many, of, the, qualifications, and, refinements, contained, in, galileo, s, theory, of, falling, bodies, he, did, not, for, instance, recognise, as, galileo, did, that, a, body, would, fall, with, a, strictly, uniform, acceleration, only, in, a, vacuum, and, that, it, would, otherwise, eventually, reach, a, uniform, terminal, velocity, in, 1586, simon, stevin, commonly, known, as, stevinus, and, jan, cornets, de, groot, dropped, lead, balls, from, the, nieuwe, kerk, in, the, dutch, city, of, delft, the, experiment, established, that, objects, of, identical, size, but, different, masses, fall, at, the, same, speed, while, the, delft, tower, experiment, had, been, a, success, it, was, not, conducted, with, the, same, scientific, rigour, that, later, experiments, were, stevin, was, forced, to, rely, on, audio, feedback, caused, by, the, spheres, impacting, a, wooden, platform, below, to, deduce, that, the, balls, had, fallen, at, the, same, speed, the, experiment, was, given, less, credence, than, the, more, substantive, work, of, galileo, galilei, and, his, famous, leaning, tower, of, pisa, thought, experiment, of, 1589, a, biography, by, galileo, s, pupil, vincenzo, viviani, stated, that, galileo, had, dropped, balls, of, the, same, material, but, different, masses, from, the, leaning, tower, of, pisa, to, demonstrate, that, their, time, of, descent, was, independent, of, their, mass, this, was, contrary, to, what, aristotle, had, taught, that, heavy, objects, fall, faster, than, lighter, ones, in, direct, proportion, to, weight, while, this, story, has, been, retold, in, popular, accounts, there, is, no, account, by, galileo, himself, of, such, an, experiment, and, it, is, generally, accepted, by, historians, that, it, was, at, most, a, thought, experiment, which, did, not, actually, take, place, an, exception, is, stillman, drake, who, argues, that, the, experiment, did, take, place, more, or, less, as, viviani, described, it, however, most, of, galileo, s, experiments, with, falling, bodies, were, carried, out, using, inclined, planes, where, both, the, issues, of, timing, and, air, resistance, were, much, reduced, in, his, 1638, two, new, sciences, galileo, s, character, salviati, widely, regarded, as, galileo, s, spokesman, held, that, all, unequal, weights, would, fall, with, the, same, finite, speed, in, a, vacuum, salviati, also, held, that, this, could, be, experimentally, demonstrated, by, the, comparison, of, pendulum, motions, in, air, with, bobs, of, lead, and, of, cork, which, had, different, weights, but, which, were, otherwise, similar, galileo, proposed, that, a, falling, body, would, fall, with, a, uniform, acceleration, as, long, as, the, resistance, of, the, medium, through, which, it, was, falling, remained, negligible, or, in, the, limiting, case, of, its, falling, through, a, vacuum, he, also, derived, the, correct, kinematical, law, for, the, distance, travelled, during, a, uniform, acceleration, starting, from, rest, namely, that, it, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, elapsed, time, d, t, 2, galileo, expressed, the, time, squared, law, using, geometrical, constructions, and, mathematically, precise, words, adhering, to, the, standards, of, the, day, it, remained, for, others, to, re, express, the, law, in, algebraic, terms, galileo, also, concluded, that, objects, retain, their, velocity, in, the, absence, of, any, impediments, to, their, motion, thereby, contradicting, the, generally, accepted, aristotelian, hypothesis, that, a, body, could, only, remain, in, so, called, violent, unnatural, or, forced, motion, so, long, as, an, agent, of, change, the, mover, continued, to, act, on, it, philosophical, ideas, relating, to, inertia, had, been, proposed, by, john, philoponus, and, jean, buridan, galileo, stated, imagine, any, particle, projected, along, a, horizontal, plane, without, friction, then, we, know, from, what, has, been, more, fully, explained, in, the, preceding, pages, that, this, particle, will, move, along, this, same, plane, with, a, motion, which, is, uniform, and, perpetual, provided, the, plane, has, no, limits, but, the, surface, of, the, earth, would, be, an, instance, of, such, a, plane, if, all, its, unevenness, could, be, removed, this, was, incorporated, into, newton, s, laws, of, motion, first, law, except, for, the, direction, of, the, motion, newton, s, is, straight, galileo, s, is, circular, for, example, the, planets, motion, around, the, sun, which, according, to, him, and, unlike, newton, takes, place, in, absence, of, gravity, according, to, dijksterhuis, galileo, s, conception, of, inertia, as, a, tendency, to, persevere, in, circular, motion, is, closely, related, to, his, copernican, conviction, while, galileo, s, application, of, mathematics, to, experimental, physics, was, innovative, his, mathematical, methods, were, the, standard, ones, of, the, day, including, dozens, of, examples, of, an, inverse, proportion, square, root, method, passed, down, from, fibonacci, and, archimedes, the, analysis, and, proofs, relied, heavily, on, the, eudoxian, theory, of, proportion, as, set, forth, in, the, fifth, book, of, euclid, s, elements, this, theory, had, become, available, only, a, century, before, thanks, to, accurate, translations, by, tartaglia, and, others, but, by, the, end, of, galileo, s, life, it, was, being, superseded, by, the, algebraic, methods, of, descartes, the, concept, now, named, galileo, s, paradox, was, not, original, with, him, his, proposed, solution, that, infinite, numbers, cannot, be, compared, is, no, longer, considered, useful, the, galileo, affair, was, largely, forgotten, after, galileo, s, death, and, the, controversy, subsided, the, inquisition, s, ban, on, reprinting, galileo, s, works, was, lifted, in, 1718, when, permission, was, granted, to, publish, an, edition, of, his, works, excluding, the, condemned, dialogue, in, florence, in, 1741, pope, benedict, xiv, authorised, the, publication, of, an, edition, of, galileo, s, complete, scientific, works, which, included, a, mildly, censored, version, of, the, dialogue, in, 1758, the, general, prohibition, against, works, advocating, heliocentrism, was, removed, from, the, index, of, prohibited, books, although, the, specific, ban, on, uncensored, versions, of, the, dialogue, and, copernicus, s, de, revolutionibus, remained, all, traces, of, official, opposition, to, heliocentrism, by, the, church, disappeared, in, 1835, when, these, works, were, finally, dropped, from, the, index, interest, in, the, galileo, affair, was, revived, in, the, early, 19th, century, when, protestant, polemicists, used, it, and, other, events, such, as, the, spanish, inquisition, and, the, myth, of, the, flat, earth, to, attack, roman, catholicism, interest, in, it, has, waxed, and, waned, ever, since, in, 1939, pope, pius, xii, in, his, first, speech, to, the, pontifical, academy, of, sciences, within, a, few, months, of, his, election, to, the, papacy, described, galileo, as, being, among, the, most, audacious, heroes, of, research, not, afraid, of, the, stumbling, blocks, and, the, risks, on, the, way, nor, fearful, of, the, funereal, monuments, his, close, advisor, of, 40, years, professor, robert, leiber, wrote, pius, xii, was, very, careful, not, to, close, any, doors, to, science, prematurely, he, was, energetic, on, this, point, and, regretted, that, in, the, case, of, galileo, on, 15, february, 1990, in, a, speech, delivered, at, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, cardinal, ratzinger, later, pope, benedict, xvi, cited, some, current, views, on, the, galileo, affair, as, forming, what, he, called, a, symptomatic, case, that, permits, us, to, see, how, deep, the, self, doubt, of, the, modern, age, of, science, and, technology, goes, today, some, of, the, views, he, cited, were, those, of, the, philosopher, paul, feyerabend, whom, he, quoted, as, saying, the, church, at, the, time, of, galileo, kept, much, more, closely, to, reason, than, did, galileo, himself, and, it, took, into, consideration, the, ethical, and, social, consequences, of, galileo, s, teaching, too, its, verdict, against, galileo, was, rational, and, just, and, the, revision, of, this, verdict, can, be, justified, only, on, the, grounds, of, what, is, politically, opportune, the, cardinal, did, not, clearly, indicate, whether, he, agreed, or, disagreed, with, feyerabend, s, assertions, he, did, however, say, it, would, be, foolish, to, construct, an, impulsive, apologetic, on, the, basis, of, such, views, on, 31, october, 1992, pope, john, paul, ii, acknowledged, that, the, inquisition, had, erred, in, condemning, galileo, for, asserting, that, the, earth, revolves, around, the, sun, john, paul, said, the, theologians, who, condemned, galileo, did, not, recognize, the, formal, distinction, between, the, bible, and, its, interpretation, in, march, 2008, the, head, of, the, pontifical, academy, of, sciences, nicola, cabibbo, announced, a, plan, to, honour, galileo, by, erecting, a, statue, of, him, inside, the, vatican, walls, in, december, of, the, same, year, during, events, to, mark, the, 400th, anniversary, of, galileo, s, earliest, telescopic, observations, pope, benedict, xvi, praised, his, contributions, to, astronomy, a, month, later, however, the, head, of, the, pontifical, council, for, culture, gianfranco, ravasi, revealed, that, the, plan, to, erect, a, statue, of, galileo, on, the, grounds, of, the, vatican, had, been, suspended, according, to, stephen, hawking, galileo, probably, bears, more, of, the, responsibility, for, the, birth, of, modern, science, than, anybody, else, and, albert, einstein, called, him, the, father, of, modern, science, galileo, s, astronomical, discoveries, and, investigations, into, the, copernican, theory, have, led, to, a, lasting, legacy, which, includes, the, categorisation, of, the, four, large, moons, of, jupiter, discovered, by, galileo, io, europa, ganymede, and, callisto, as, the, galilean, moons, other, scientific, endeavours, and, principles, are, named, after, galileo, including, the, galileo, spacecraft, partly, because, the, year, 2009, was, the, fourth, centenary, of, galileo, s, first, recorded, astronomical, observations, with, the, telescope, the, united, nations, scheduled, it, to, be, the, international, year, of, astronomy, galileo, s, early, works, describing, scientific, instruments, include, the, 1586, tract, entitled, the, little, balance, la, billancetta, describing, an, accurate, balance, to, weigh, objects, in, air, or, water, and, the, 1606, printed, manual, le, operazioni, del, compasso, geometrico, et, militare, on, the, operation, of, a, geometrical, and, military, compass, his, early, works, on, dynamics, the, science, of, motion, and, mechanics, were, his, circa, 1590, pisan, de, motu, on, motion, and, his, circa, 1600, paduan, le, meccaniche, mechanics, the, former, was, based, on, aristotelian, archimedean, fluid, dynamics, and, held, that, the, speed, of, gravitational, fall, in, a, fluid, medium, was, proportional, to, the, excess, of, a, body, s, specific, weight, over, that, of, the, medium, whereby, in, a, vacuum, bodies, would, fall, with, speeds, in, proportion, to, their, specific, weights, it, also, subscribed, to, the, philoponan, impetus, dynamics, in, which, impetus, is, self, dissipating, and, free, fall, in, a, vacuum, would, have, an, essential, terminal, speed, according, to, specific, weight, after, an, initial, period, of, acceleration, galileo, s, 1610, the, starry, messenger, sidereus, nuncius, was, the, first, scientific, treatise, to, be, published, based, on, observations, made, through, a, telescope, it, reported, his, discoveries, of, galileo, published, a, description, of, sunspots, in, 1613, entitled, letters, on, sunspots, suggesting, the, sun, and, heavens, are, corruptible, the, letters, on, sunspots, also, reported, his, 1610, telescopic, observations, of, the, full, set, of, phases, of, venus, and, his, discovery, of, the, puzzling, appendages, of, saturn, and, their, even, more, puzzling, subsequent, disappearance, in, 1615, galileo, prepared, a, manuscript, known, as, the, letter, to, the, grand, duchess, christina, which, was, not, published, in, printed, form, until, 1636, this, letter, was, a, revised, version, of, the, letter, to, castelli, which, was, denounced, by, the, inquisition, as, an, incursion, upon, theology, by, advocating, copernicanism, both, as, physically, true, and, as, consistent, with, scripture, in, 1616, after, the, order, by, the, inquisition, for, galileo, not, to, hold, or, defend, the, copernican, position, galileo, wrote, the, discourse, on, the, tides, discorso, sul, flusso, e, il, reflusso, del, mare, based, on, the, copernican, earth, in, the, form, of, a, private, letter, to, cardinal, orsini, in, 1619, mario, guiducci, a, pupil, of, galileo, s, published, a, lecture, written, largely, by, galileo, under, the, title, discourse, on, the, comets, discorso, delle, comete, arguing, against, the, jesuit, interpretation, of, comets, in, 1623, galileo, published, the, assayer, il, saggiatore, which, attacked, theories, based, on, aristotle, s, authority, and, promoted, experimentation, and, the, mathematical, formulation, of, scientific, ideas, the, book, was, highly, successful, and, even, found, support, among, the, higher, echelons, of, the, christian, church, following, the, success, of, the, assayer, galileo, published, the, dialogue, concerning, the, two, chief, world, systems, dialogo, sopra, i, due, massimi, sistemi, del, mondo, in, 1632, despite, taking, care, to, adhere, to, the, inquisition, s, 1616, instructions, the, claims, in, the, book, favouring, copernican, theory, and, a, non, geocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, led, to, galileo, being, tried, and, banned, from, publication, despite, the, publication, ban, galileo, published, his, discourses, and, mathematical, demonstrations, relating, to, two, new, sciences, discorsi, e, dimostrazioni, matematiche, intorno, a, due, nuove, scienze, in, 1638, in, holland, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, inquisition, galileo, s, main, written, works, are, as, follows, in, the, last, years, of, his, life, galileo, galilei, kept, a, library, of, at, least, 598, volumes, 560, of, which, have, been, identified, at, villa, il, gioiello, on, the, outskirts, of, florence, under, the, restrictions, of, house, arrest, he, was, forbidden, to, write, or, publish, his, ideas, however, he, continued, to, receive, visitors, right, up, to, his, death, and, it, was, through, them, that, he, remained, supplied, with, the, latest, scientific, texts, from, northern, europe, galileo, s, will, does, not, refer, to, his, collection, of, books, and, manuscripts, an, itemized, inventory, was, only, later, produced, after, galileo, s, death, when, the, majority, of, his, possessions, including, his, library, passed, to, his, son, vincenzo, galilei, jr, on, his, death, in, 1649, the, collection, was, inherited, by, his, wife, sestilia, bocchineri, galileo, s, books, personal, papers, and, unedited, manuscripts, were, then, collected, by, vincenzo, viviani, his, former, assistant, and, student, with, the, intent, of, preserving, his, old, teacher, s, works, in, published, form, it, was, a, project, that, never, materialised, and, in, his, final, will, viviani, bequeathed, a, significant, portion, of, the, collection, to, the, hospital, of, santa, maria, nuova, in, florence, where, there, already, existed, an, extensive, library, the, value, of, galileo, s, possessions, was, not, realised, and, duplicate, copies, were, dispersed, to, other, libraries, such, as, the, biblioteca, comunale, degli, intronati, the, public, library, in, sienna, in, a, later, attempt, to, specialise, the, library, s, holdings, volumes, unrelated, to, medicine, were, transferred, to, the, biblioteca, magliabechiana, an, early, foundation, for, what, was, to, become, the, biblioteca, nazionale, centrale, di, firenze, the, national, central, library, in, florence, a, small, portion, of, viviani, s, collection, including, the, manuscripts, of, galileo, and, those, of, his, peers, evangelista, torricelli, and, benedetto, castelli, was, left, to, his, nephew, abbot, jacopo, panzanini, this, minor, collection, was, preserved, until, panzanini, s, death, when, it, passed, to, his, great, nephews, carlo, and, angelo, panzanini, the, books, from, both, galileo, and, viviani, s, collections, began, to, disperse, as, the, heirs, failed, to, protect, their, inheritance, their, servants, sold, several, of, the, volumes, for, waste, paper, around, 1750, the, florentine, senator, giovanni, battista, clemente, de, nelli, heard, of, this, and, purchased, the, books, and, manuscripts, from, the, shopkeepers, and, the, remainder, of, viviani, s, collection, from, the, panzanini, brothers, as, recounted, in, nelli, s, memoirs, my, great, fortune, in, obtaining, such, a, wonderful, treasure, so, cheaply, came, about, through, the, ignorance, of, the, people, selling, it, who, were, not, aware, of, the, value, of, those, manuscripts, the, library, remained, in, nelli, s, care, until, his, death, in, 1793, knowing, the, value, of, their, father, s, collected, manuscripts, nelli, s, sons, attempted, to, sell, what, was, left, to, them, to, the, french, government, ferdinand, iii, grand, duke, of, tuscany, intervened, in, the, sale, and, purchased, the, entire, collection, the, archive, of, manuscripts, printed, books, and, personal, papers, was, deposited, with, the, biblioteca, palatina, in, florence, merging, the, collection, with, the, biblioteca, magliabechiana, in, 1861
