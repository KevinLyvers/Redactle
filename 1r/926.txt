titus, flavius, clemens, also, known, as, clement, of, alexandria, ancient, greek, c, 150, c, 215, ad, was, a, christian, theologian, and, philosopher, who, taught, at, the, catechetical, school, of, alexandria, among, his, pupils, were, origen, and, alexander, of, jerusalem, a, convert, to, christianity, he, was, an, educated, man, who, was, familiar, with, classical, greek, philosophy, and, literature, as, his, three, major, works, demonstrate, clement, was, influenced, by, hellenistic, philosophy, to, a, greater, extent, than, any, other, christian, thinker, of, his, time, and, in, particular, by, plato, and, the, stoics, his, secret, works, which, exist, only, in, fragments, suggest, that, he, was, familiar, with, pre, christian, jewish, esotericism, and, gnosticism, as, well, in, one, of, his, works, he, argued, that, greek, philosophy, had, its, origin, among, non, greeks, claiming, that, both, plato, and, pythagoras, were, taught, by, egyptian, scholars, clement, is, usually, regarded, as, a, church, father, he, is, venerated, as, a, saint, in, coptic, christianity, eastern, catholicism, ethiopian, christianity, and, anglicanism, he, was, revered, in, western, catholicism, until, 1586, when, his, name, was, removed, from, the, roman, martyrology, by, pope, sixtus, v, on, the, advice, of, baronius, the, eastern, orthodox, church, officially, stopped, any, veneration, of, clement, of, alexandria, in, the, 10th, century, nonetheless, he, is, still, sometimes, referred, to, as, saint, clement, of, alexandria, by, both, eastern, orthodox, and, catholic, authors, neither, clement, s, birthdate, or, birthplace, is, known, with, any, degree, of, certainty, it, is, speculated, that, he, was, born, sometime, around, 150, ad, according, to, epiphanius, of, salamis, he, was, born, in, athens, but, there, is, also, a, tradition, of, an, alexandrian, birth, his, parents, were, pagans, and, clement, was, a, convert, to, christianity, in, the, protrepticus, he, displays, an, extensive, knowledge, of, greek, religion, and, mystery, religions, which, could, have, arisen, only, from, the, practice, of, his, family, s, religion, having, rejected, paganism, as, a, young, man, due, to, its, perceived, moral, corruption, he, travelled, in, greece, asia, minor, palestine, and, egypt, clement, s, journeys, were, primarily, a, religious, undertaking, in, greece, he, encountered, an, ionian, theologian, who, has, been, identified, as, athenagoras, of, athens, while, in, the, east, he, was, taught, by, an, assyrian, sometimes, identified, with, tatian, and, a, jew, possibly, theophilus, of, caesarea, in, around, 180, ad, clement, reached, alexandria, where, he, met, pantaenus, who, taught, at, the, catechetical, school, of, alexandria, eusebius, suggests, that, pantaenus, was, the, head, of, the, school, but, controversy, exists, about, whether, the, institutions, of, the, school, were, formalized, in, this, way, before, the, time, of, origen, clement, studied, under, pantaenus, and, was, ordained, to, the, priesthood, by, pope, julian, before, 189, otherwise, virtually, nothing, is, known, of, clement, s, personal, life, in, alexandria, he, may, have, been, married, a, conjecture, supported, by, his, writings, during, the, severian, persecution, of, 202, 203, clement, left, alexandria, in, 211, alexander, of, jerusalem, wrote, a, letter, commending, him, to, the, church, of, antioch, which, may, imply, that, clement, was, living, in, cappadocia, or, jerusalem, at, that, time, he, died, c, 215, ad, at, an, unknown, location, three, of, clement, s, major, works, have, survived, in, full, and, they, are, collectively, referred, to, as, a, trilogy, the, protrepticus, greek, exhortation, to, the, greeks, is, as, its, title, suggests, an, exhortation, to, the, pagans, of, greece, to, adopt, christianity, within, it, clement, demonstrates, his, extensive, knowledge, of, pagan, mythology, and, theology, it, is, chiefly, important, due, to, clement, s, exposition, of, religion, as, an, anthropological, phenomenon, after, a, short, philosophical, discussion, it, opens, with, a, history, of, greek, religion, in, seven, stages, clement, suggests, that, at, first, humans, mistakenly, believed, the, sun, the, moon, and, other, heavenly, bodies, to, be, deities, the, next, developmental, stage, was, the, worship, of, the, products, of, agriculture, from, which, he, contends, the, cults, of, demeter, and, dionysus, arose, humans, then, paid, reverence, to, revenge, and, deified, human, feelings, of, love, and, fear, among, others, in, the, following, stage, the, poets, hesiod, and, homer, attempt, to, enumerate, the, deities, hesiod, s, theogony, giving, the, number, of, twelve, finally, humans, reached, a, stage, when, they, proclaimed, others, such, as, asclepius, and, heracles, as, deities, discussing, idolatry, clement, contends, that, the, objects, of, primitive, religion, were, unshaped, wood, and, stone, and, idols, thus, arose, when, such, natural, items, were, carved, following, plato, clement, is, critical, of, all, forms, of, visual, art, suggesting, that, artworks, are, but, illusions, and, deadly, toys, clement, criticizes, greek, paganism, in, the, protrepticus, on, the, basis, that, its, deities, are, both, false, and, poor, moral, examples, he, attacks, the, mystery, religions, for, their, ritualism, and, mysticism, in, particular, the, worshippers, of, dionysus, are, ridiculed, by, him, for, their, family, based, rituals, such, as, the, use, of, children, s, toys, in, ceremony, he, suggests, at, some, points, that, the, pagan, deities, are, based, on, humans, but, at, other, times, he, suggests, that, they, are, misanthropic, demons, and, he, cites, several, classical, sources, in, support, of, this, second, hypothesis, clement, like, many, pre, nicene, church, fathers, writes, favourably, about, euhemerus, and, other, rationalist, philosophers, on, the, grounds, that, they, at, least, saw, the, flaws, in, paganism, however, his, greatest, praise, is, reserved, for, plato, whose, apophatic, views, of, god, prefigure, christianity, the, figure, of, orpheus, is, prominent, throughout, the, protrepticus, narrative, and, clement, contrasts, the, song, of, orpheus, representing, pagan, superstition, with, the, divine, logos, of, christ, according, to, clement, through, conversion, to, christianity, alone, can, one, fully, participate, in, the, logos, which, is, universal, truth, the, title, of, paedagogus, translatable, as, tutor, refers, to, christ, as, the, teacher, of, all, humans, and, it, features, an, extended, metaphor, of, christians, as, children, it, is, not, simply, instructional, clement, intends, to, show, how, the, christian, should, respond, to, the, love, of, god, authentically, following, plato, republic, 4, 441, he, divides, life, into, three, elements, character, actions, and, passions, the, first, having, been, dealt, with, in, the, protrepticus, he, devotes, the, paedagogus, to, reflections, on, christ, s, role, in, teaching, humans, to, act, morally, and, to, control, their, passions, despite, its, explicitly, christian, nature, clement, s, work, draws, on, stoic, philosophy, and, pagan, literature, homer, alone, is, cited, more, than, sixty, times, in, the, work, although, christ, like, a, human, is, made, in, the, image, of, god, he, alone, shares, the, likeness, of, god, the, father, christ, is, both, sinless, and, apathetic, and, thus, by, striving, to, imitate, christ, one, can, achieve, salvation, to, clement, sin, is, involuntary, and, thus, irrational, removed, only, through, the, wisdom, of, the, logos, god, s, guidance, away, from, sin, is, thus, a, manifestation, of, god, s, universal, love, for, mankind, the, word, play, on, and, is, characteristic, of, clement, s, writing, and, may, be, rooted, in, the, epicurean, belief, that, relationships, between, words, are, deeply, reflective, of, relationships, between, the, objects, they, signify, clement, argues, for, the, equality, of, sexes, on, the, grounds, that, salvation, is, extended, to, all, humans, equally, unusually, he, suggests, that, christ, is, neither, female, nor, male, and, that, god, the, father, has, both, female, and, male, aspects, the, eucharist, is, described, as, milk, from, the, breast, christ, of, the, father, clement, is, supportive, of, women, playing, an, active, role, in, the, leadership, of, the, church, and, he, provides, a, list, of, women, he, considers, inspirational, which, includes, both, biblical, and, classical, greek, figures, it, has, been, suggested, that, clement, s, progressive, views, on, gender, as, set, out, in, the, paedagogus, were, influenced, by, gnosticism, however, later, in, the, work, he, argues, against, the, gnostics, that, faith, not, esoteric, knowledge, is, required, for, salvation, according, to, clement, it, is, through, faith, in, christ, that, one, is, enlightened, and, comes, to, know, god, in, the, second, book, clement, provides, practical, rules, on, living, a, christian, life, he, argues, against, overindulgence, in, food, and, in, favour, of, good, table, manners, while, prohibiting, drunkenness, he, promotes, the, drinking, of, alcohol, in, moderation, following, 1, timothy, 5, 23, clement, argues, for, a, simple, way, of, life, in, accordance, with, the, innate, simplicity, of, christian, monotheism, he, condemns, elaborate, and, expensive, furnishings, and, clothing, and, argues, against, overly, passionate, music, and, perfumes, but, clement, does, not, believe, in, the, abandonment, of, worldly, pleasures, and, argues, that, the, christian, should, be, able, to, express, joy, in, god, s, creation, through, gaiety, and, partying, he, opposes, the, wearing, of, garlands, because, the, picking, of, the, flowers, ultimately, kills, a, beautiful, creation, of, god, and, the, garland, resembles, the, crown, of, thorns, clement, treats, sex, at, some, length, he, argues, that, both, promiscuity, and, sexual, abstinence, are, unnatural, and, that, the, main, goal, of, human, sexuality, is, procreation, he, argues, that, adultery, sex, with, pregnant, women, concubinage, homosexuality, and, prostitution, all, should, be, avoided, as, they, will, not, contribute, toward, the, generation, of, legitimate, offspring, in, his, third, book, clement, continues, along, a, similar, vein, condemning, cosmetics, on, the, grounds, that, it, is, one, s, soul, not, the, body, one, should, seek, to, beautify, clement, also, opposes, the, dyeing, of, men, s, hair, and, male, depilation, as, being, effeminate, he, advises, choosing, one, s, company, carefully, to, avoid, being, corrupted, by, immoral, people, and, while, arguing, that, material, wealth, is, no, sin, in, itself, it, is, too, likely, to, distract, one, from, the, infinitely, more, important, spiritual, wealth, that, is, found, in, christ, the, work, finishes, with, selections, of, scripture, supporting, clement, s, argument, and, following, a, prayer, the, lyrics, of, a, hymn, the, contents, of, the, stromata, as, its, title, suggests, are, miscellaneous, its, place, in, the, trilogy, is, disputed, clement, initially, intended, to, write, the, didasculus, a, work, that, would, complement, the, practical, guidance, of, the, paedagogus, with, a, more, intellectual, schooling, in, theology, the, stromata, is, less, systematic, and, ordered, than, clement, s, other, works, and, it, has, been, theorized, by, andr, m, hat, that, it, was, intended, for, a, limited, esoteric, readership, although, eusebius, wrote, of, the, eight, books, of, the, work, only, seven, undoubtedly, survive, photius, writing, in, the, 9th, century, found, various, text, appended, to, manuscripts, of, the, seven, canonical, books, which, led, daniel, heinsius, to, suggest, that, the, original, eighth, book, is, lost, and, he, identified, the, text, purported, to, be, from, the, eighth, book, as, fragments, of, the, hypotyposes, the, first, book, starts, on, the, topic, of, greek, philosophy, consistent, with, his, other, writing, clement, affirms, that, philosophy, had, a, propaedeutic, role, for, the, greeks, similar, to, the, function, of, the, law, for, the, jews, he, then, embarks, on, a, discussion, of, the, origins, of, greek, culture, and, technology, arguing, that, most, of, the, important, figures, in, the, greek, world, were, foreigners, and, that, jewish, culture, was, the, most, significant, influence, on, greece, in, an, attempt, to, demonstrate, the, primacy, of, moses, clement, gives, an, extended, chronology, of, the, world, wherein, he, dates, the, birth, of, christ, to, 25, april, or, may, 4, 2, bc, and, the, creation, of, the, world, to, 5592, bc, the, books, ends, with, a, discussion, on, the, origin, of, languages, and, the, possibility, of, a, jewish, influence, on, plato, the, second, book, is, largely, devoted, to, the, respective, roles, of, faith, and, philosophical, argument, clement, contends, that, while, both, are, important, the, fear, of, god, is, foremost, because, through, faith, one, receives, divine, wisdom, to, clement, scripture, is, an, innately, true, primitive, philosophy, that, is, complemented, by, human, reason, through, the, logos, faith, is, voluntary, and, the, decision, to, believe, is, a, crucial, fundamental, step, in, becoming, closer, to, god, it, is, never, irrational, as, it, is, founded, on, the, knowledge, of, the, truth, of, the, logos, but, all, knowledge, proceeds, from, faith, as, first, principles, are, unprovable, outside, a, systematic, structure, the, third, book, covers, asceticism, he, discusses, marriage, which, is, treated, similarly, in, the, paedagogus, clement, rejects, the, gnostic, opposition, to, marriage, arguing, that, only, men, who, are, uninterested, in, women, should, remain, celibate, and, that, sex, is, a, positive, good, if, performed, within, marriage, for, the, purposes, of, procreation, he, argues, that, this, has, not, always, been, so, the, fall, occurred, because, adam, and, eve, succumbed, to, their, desire, for, each, other, and, copulated, before, the, allotted, time, he, argues, against, the, idea, that, christians, should, reject, their, family, for, an, ascetic, life, which, stems, from, luke, contending, that, jesus, would, not, have, contradicted, the, precept, to, honour, thy, father, and, thy, mother, one, of, the, ten, commandments, clement, concludes, that, asceticism, will, only, be, rewarded, if, the, motivation, is, christian, in, nature, and, thus, the, asceticism, of, non, christians, such, as, the, gymnosophists, is, pointless, clement, begins, the, fourth, book, with, a, belated, explanation, of, the, disorganized, nature, of, the, work, and, gives, a, brief, description, of, his, aims, for, the, remaining, three, or, four, books, the, fourth, book, focuses, on, martyrdom, while, all, good, christians, should, be, unafraid, of, death, clement, condemns, those, who, actively, seek, out, a, martyr, s, death, arguing, that, they, do, not, have, sufficient, respect, for, god, s, gift, of, life, he, is, ambivalent, about, whether, any, believing, christians, can, become, martyrs, by, virtue, of, the, manner, of, their, death, or, whether, martyrdom, is, reserved, for, those, who, have, lived, exceptional, lives, marcionites, cannot, become, martyrs, because, they, do, not, believe, in, the, divinity, of, god, the, father, so, their, sufferings, are, in, vain, there, is, then, a, digression, to, the, subject, of, theological, epistemology, according, to, clement, there, is, no, way, of, empirically, testing, the, existence, of, god, the, father, because, the, logos, has, revelatory, not, analysable, meaning, although, christ, was, an, object, of, the, senses, god, had, no, beginning, and, is, the, universal, first, principle, the, fifth, book, returns, to, the, subject, of, faith, clement, argues, that, truth, justice, and, goodness, can, be, seen, only, by, the, mind, not, the, eye, faith, is, a, way, of, accessing, the, unseeable, he, stresses, that, knowledge, of, god, can, only, be, achieved, through, faith, once, one, s, moral, faults, have, been, corrected, this, parallels, clement, s, earlier, insistence, that, martyrdom, can, only, be, achieved, by, those, who, practice, their, faith, in, christ, through, good, deeds, not, those, who, simply, profess, their, faith, god, transcends, matter, entirely, and, thus, the, materialist, cannot, truly, come, to, know, god, although, christ, was, god, incarnate, it, is, spiritual, not, physical, comprehension, of, him, that, is, important, in, the, beginning, of, the, sixth, book, clement, intends, to, demonstrate, that, the, works, of, greek, poets, were, derived, from, the, prophetic, books, of, the, bible, in, order, to, reinforce, his, position, that, the, greeks, were, inclined, toward, plagiarism, he, cites, numerous, instances, of, such, inappropriate, appropriation, by, classical, greek, writers, reported, second, hand, from, on, plagiarism, an, anonymous, 3rd, century, bc, work, sometimes, ascribed, to, aretades, clement, then, digresses, to, the, subject, of, sin, and, hell, arguing, that, adam, was, not, perfect, when, created, but, given, the, potential, to, achieve, perfection, he, espouses, broadly, universalist, doctrine, holding, that, christ, s, promise, of, salvation, is, available, to, all, even, those, condemned, to, hell, the, final, extant, book, begins, with, clement, arguing, that, his, version, of, gnosticism, what, he, calls, the, christian, gnostic, earlier, in, stromata, is, the, true, religion, and, states, they, should, be, an, example, of, what, a, true, christian, is, even, saying, they, are, holy, and, pious, and, worships, the, true, god, in, a, manner, worthy, of, him, clement, then, gives, a, description, of, the, nature, of, christ, and, that, of, the, true, christian, who, aims, to, be, as, similar, as, possible, to, both, the, father, and, the, son, clement, then, criticizes, the, simplistic, anthropomorphism, of, most, ancient, religions, quoting, xenophanes, famous, description, of, african, thracian, and, egyptian, deities, he, indicates, that, the, greek, deities, may, also, have, had, their, origins, in, the, personification, of, material, objects, ares, representing, iron, and, dionysus, wine, prayer, and, the, relationship, between, love, and, knowledge, are, then, discussed, corinthians, 13, 8, seems, to, contradict, the, characterization, of, the, true, christian, as, one, who, knows, but, to, clement, knowledge, vanishes, only, in, that, it, is, subsumed, by, the, universal, love, expressed, by, the, christian, in, reverence, for, the, creator, following, socrates, he, argues, that, vice, arises, from, a, state, of, ignorance, not, from, intention, the, christian, is, a, laborer, in, god, s, vineyard, responsible, both, for, one, s, own, path, to, salvation, and, that, of, one, s, neighbor, the, work, ends, with, an, extended, passage, against, the, contemporary, divisions, and, heresies, within, the, church, besides, the, great, trilogy, clement, s, only, other, extant, work, is, the, treatise, salvation, for, the, rich, also, known, as, who, is, the, rich, man, who, is, saved, written, c, 203, ad, having, begun, with, a, scathing, criticism, of, the, corrupting, effects, of, money, and, misguided, servile, attitudes, toward, the, wealthy, clement, discusses, the, implications, of, mark, 10, 25, the, rich, are, either, unconvinced, by, the, promise, of, eternal, life, or, unaware, of, the, conflict, between, the, possession, of, material, and, spiritual, wealth, and, the, good, christian, has, a, duty, to, guide, them, toward, a, better, life, through, the, gospel, jesus, words, are, not, to, be, taken, literally, the, supercelestial, meanings, should, be, sought, in, which, the, true, route, to, salvation, is, revealed, the, holding, of, material, wealth, in, itself, is, not, a, wrong, so, long, as, it, is, used, charitably, but, christians, should, be, careful, not, to, let, their, wealth, dominate, their, spirit, it, is, more, important, to, give, up, sinful, passions, than, external, wealth, if, the, rich, are, to, be, saved, all, they, must, do, is, to, follow, the, two, commandments, and, while, material, wealth, is, of, no, value, to, god, it, can, be, used, to, alleviate, the, suffering, of, neighbors, other, known, works, exist, in, fragments, alone, including, the, four, eschatological, works, in, the, secret, tradition, hypotyposes, excerpta, ex, theodoto, eclogae, propheticae, and, the, adumbraetiones, these, cover, clement, s, celestial, hierarchy, a, complex, schema, in, which, the, universe, is, headed, by, the, face, of, god, below, which, lie, seven, protoctists, followed, by, archangels, angels, and, humans, according, to, jean, dani, lou, this, schema, is, inherited, from, a, judaeo, christian, esotericism, followed, by, the, apostles, which, was, only, imparted, orally, to, those, christians, who, could, be, trusted, with, such, mysteries, the, proctocists, are, the, first, beings, created, by, god, and, act, as, priests, to, the, archangels, clement, identifies, them, both, as, the, eyes, of, the, lord, and, with, the, thrones, clement, characterizes, the, celestial, forms, as, entirely, different, from, anything, earthly, although, he, argues, that, members, of, each, order, only, seem, incorporeal, to, those, of, lower, orders, according, to, the, eclogae, propheticae, every, thousand, years, every, member, of, each, order, moves, up, a, degree, and, thus, humans, can, become, angels, even, the, protoctists, can, be, elevated, although, their, new, position, in, the, hierarchy, is, not, clearly, defined, the, apparent, contradiction, between, the, fact, that, there, can, be, only, seven, protoctists, but, also, a, vast, number, of, archangels, to, be, promoted, to, their, order, is, problematical, one, modern, solution, regards, the, story, as, an, example, of, interiorized, apocalypticism, imagistic, details, are, not, to, be, taken, literally, but, as, symbolizing, interior, transformation, the, titles, of, several, lost, works, are, known, because, of, a, list, in, eusebius, ecclesiastical, history, 6, 13, 1, 3, they, include, the, outlines, in, eight, books, and, against, judaizers, others, are, known, only, from, mentions, in, clement, s, own, writings, including, on, marriage, and, on, prophecy, although, few, are, attested, by, other, writers, and, it, is, difficult, to, separate, works, that, he, intended, to, write, from, those, that, were, completed, the, mar, saba, letter, was, attributed, to, clement, by, morton, smith, but, there, remains, much, debate, today, over, whether, it, is, an, authentic, letter, from, clement, an, ancient, pseudepigraph, or, a, modern, forgery, if, authentic, its, main, significance, would, be, in, its, relating, that, the, apostle, mark, came, to, alexandria, from, rome, and, there, wrote, a, more, spiritual, gospel, which, he, entrusted, to, the, church, in, alexandria, on, his, death, if, genuine, the, letter, pushes, back, the, tradition, related, by, eusebius, connecting, mark, with, alexandria, by, a, century, eusebius, the, fourth, century, early, church, historian, is, the, first, writer, to, provide, an, account, of, clement, s, life, and, works, in, his, ecclesiastical, history, 5, 11, 1, 5, 6, 6, 1, he, provides, a, list, of, clement, s, works, biographical, information, and, an, extended, quotation, from, the, stromata, from, this, and, other, accounts, it, is, evident, that, clement, was, highly, revered, by, his, contemporaries, and, later, patristic, figures, as, j, b, mayor, observes, the, piety, and, learning, of, clement, his, power, as, a, teacher, and, philosopher, are, spoken, of, in, the, highest, terms, by, succeeding, fathers, in, the, same, work, eusebius, cites, alexander, of, jerusalem, 180, 251, lauding, the, holy, clement, who, was, both, my, master, and, benefactor, describing, him, as, one, of, the, blessed, fathers, who, have, trod, the, path, before, us, while, eusebius, himself, is, quoted, as, calling, him, an, incomparable, master, of, christian, philosophy, jerome, 342, 420, calls, clement, the, most, learned, of, men, recording, that, his, writings, are, full, of, eloquence, and, learning, both, in, sacred, scripture, and, in, secular, literature, the, aforementioned, alexander, of, jerusalem, is, quoted, by, jerome, praising, the, blessed, presbyter, clement, a, man, illustrious, and, approved, according, to, theodoret, 393, 450, he, surpassed, all, others, and, was, a, holy, man, likewise, cyril, of, alexandria, 376, 444, says, clement, was, a, man, admirably, learned, and, skillful, and, one, that, searched, to, the, depths, all, the, learning, of, the, greeks, with, an, exactness, rarely, attained, before, maximus, the, confessor, 580, 662, refers, to, him, reverentially, as, the, great, clement, more, recently, scholars, have, acknowledged, clement, s, primacy, and, importance, in, various, respects, he, has, been, called, the, first, christian, scholar, shelley, the, first, systematic, teacher, of, christian, doctrine, patrick, the,

who, introduced, christianity, to, itself, as, reflected, in, the, burnished, mirror, of, his, intellect, coxe, and, the, most, inquisitive, and, independent, spirit, that, has, perhaps, ever, appeared, in, the, church, defaye, stylistically, it, has, been, noted, that, his, writings, shine, with, a, happy, peaceful, optimistic, spirit, reading, them, can, be, a, remarkably, uplifting, experience, needham, he, loves, god, s, creation, and, sees, it, as, good, he, gives, us, a, warm, joyous, picture, of, life, he, is, richly, human, sane, and, moderate, ferguson, additionally, clement, s, works, are, a, storehouse, of, curious, ancient, lore, a, museum, of, the, fossil, remains, of, the, beauties, and, monstrosities, of, the, world, of, pagan, antiquity, during, all, the, epochs, and, phases, of, its, history, wilson, his, prodigious, erudition, was, unsurpassed, even, by, that, of, origen, cayre, i, do, not, know, where, we, shall, look, for, a, purer, or, a, truer, man, than, this, clemens, of, alexandria, he, seems, to, me, one, of, the, old, fathers, whom, we, should, all, have, reverenced, most, as, a, teacher, and, loved, best, as, a, friend, maurice, nonetheless, there, have, been, a, few, detracting, voices, photios, i, of, constantinople, writes, polemically, against, clement, s, theology, in, the, bibliotheca, although, he, also, is, appreciative, of, clement, s, learning, and, the, literary, merits, of, his, work, in, particular, he, is, highly, critical, of, the, hypotyposes, a, work, of, biblical, exegesis, of, which, only, a, few, fragments, have, survived, photios, compared, clement, s, treatise, which, like, his, other, works, was, highly, syncretic, featuring, ideas, of, hellenistic, jewish, and, gnostic, origin, unfavorably, against, the, prevailing, orthodoxy, of, the, 9th, century, amongst, the, particular, ideas, photios, deemed, heretical, were, however, it, is, not, clear, that, these, are, accurate, representations, of, clement, s, actual, beliefs, since, his, extant, writings, appear, to, be, mostly, in, line, with, what, would, come, to, be, considered, orthodox, christian, theology, it, has, been, suggested, that, photios, may, have, misunderstood, clement, to, be, speaking, for, himself, when, he, was, often, quoting, from, gnostics, and, other, sects, without, agreeing, with, their, teachings, as, one, of, the, earliest, of, the, church, fathers, whose, works, have, survived, he, is, the, subject, of, a, significant, amount, of, recent, academic, work, focusing, on, among, other, things, his, exegesis, of, scripture, his, logos, theology, and, pneumatology, his, belief, in, apokatastasis, the, relationship, between, his, thought, and, non, christian, philosophy, and, his, influence, on, origen, up, until, the, 17th, century, clement, was, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, catholic, church, his, name, was, to, be, found, in, the, martyrologies, and, his, feast, fell, on, the, fourth, of, december, but, when, the, roman, martyrology, was, revised, by, pope, clement, viii, his, name, was, dropped, from, the, calendar, on, the, advice, of, cardinal, baronius, benedict, xiv, maintained, this, decision, of, his, predecessor, on, the, grounds, that, clement, s, life, was, little, known, that, he, had, never, obtained, public, cultus, in, the, church, and, that, some, of, his, doctrines, were, if, not, erroneous, at, least, suspect, although, clement, is, not, widely, venerated, in, eastern, christianity, the, prologue, of, ohrid, repeatedly, refers, to, him, as, a, saint, as, do, various, orthodox, authorities, including, the, greek, metropolitan, kallinikos, of, edessa, the, coptic, tradition, considers, clement, a, saint, saint, clement, coptic, orthodox, christian, academy, in, nashville, tennessee, is, specifically, named, after, him, clement, is, commemorated, in, anglicanism, clement, taught, that, faith, was, the, basis, of, salvation, he, also, believed, that, faith, was, the, basis, of, gnosis, which, to, him, meant, spiritual, and, mystical, knowledge, clement, of, alexandria, appropriated, the, word, gnosis, from, the, gnostics, whom, he, opposed, but, reinterpreted, the, word, in, a, more, christian, manner, he, distinguished, between, two, kinds, of, christians, the, pistic, christian, who, lives, according, to, god, s, law, and, the, christian, gnostic, who, lives, on, the, level, of, the, gospel, and, responds, by, discipline, and, love, clement, s, views, of, gnosis, can, be, considered, a, forerunner, of, the, christian, monastic, movement, that, began, in, egypt, after, his, death, clement, suggested, that, philosophy, was, a, preparatory, discipline, to, the, greek, world, preceding, its, wide, acceptance, of, christianity, and, often, sought, to, harmonize, insights, of, greek, philosophy, with, biblical, teaching, he, defined, philosophy, as, the, desire, for, true, being, and, the, studies, which, lead, to, it, clement, has, been, described, as, the, founder, of, what, was, to, become, the, great, tradition, of, christian, philosophical, theology, he, was, a, forerunner, to, some, of, the, later, views, of, augustine, such, as, just, war, theory, and, the, theory, of, the, two, cities, clement, is, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, first, christian, universalists, he, espoused, a, belief, in, the, eventual, salvation, of, every, person, though, not, with, the, level, of, systematic, clarity, of, his, disciple, origen, clement, believed, divine, punishment, to, be, corrective, and, remedial, rather, than, merely, retributive, or, destructive, he, writes, destroys, no, one, but, gives, salvation, to, all, he, bestows, salvation, on, all, mankind, he, indeed, saves, all, universally, some, as, converted, by, punishments, others, by, voluntary, submission, with, dignity, of, honor, that, to, him, every, knee, shall, bow, both, of, beings, in, heaven, and, on, earth, and, under, the, earth, that, is, angels, and, men, and, souls, departed, this, life, god, s, punishments, are, saving, and, disciplinary, leading, to, conversion, choosing, rather, the, repentance, than, the, death, of, a, sinner, i, will, grant, that, he, punishes, the, disobedient, for, punishment, is, for, the, good, and, advantage, of, him, who, is, punished, for, it, is, the, correction, of, a, refractory, subject, for, all, things, are, arranged, with, a, view, to, the, salvation, of, the, universe, by, the, lord, of, the, universe, both, generally, and, particularly, for, clement, disciplining, the, body, would, help, the, christian, discipline, the, soul, he, gave, detailed, instructions, on, proper, christian, conduct, decorum, and, relationships, in, the, second, and, third, books, of, the, instructor, according, to, clement, once, the, passions, are, subject, to, the, authority, of, the, word, or, reason, the, christian, can, embark, on, an, advanced, course, of, philosophical, study, and, contemplation, clement, adopted, a, position, that, gave, rise, to, a, whole, stream, of, later, christian, thought, true, philosophy, and, authentic, human, knowledge, have, their, origin, in, the, logos, which, is, the, unique, source, of, all, truth, he, accepts, the, conception, of, as, he, conducts, the, wisdom, taught, by, the, logos, through, education, in, the, sacred, letters, on, the, one, hand, the, greek, prepares, the, mind, of, the, christian, to, distinguish, and, defend, the, truth, and, on, the, other, the, liberal, arts, help, the, new, christian, to, direct, all, his, efforts, towards, the, truly, useful, of, each, particular, discipline, geometry, music, grammar, and, philosophy, notably, considering, the, time, period, clement, seemed, to, advocate, for, the, equality, of, women, and, men, in, the, area, of, education, at, least, within, the, context, of, christian, spirituality, and, ethics, he, wrote, let, us, recognize, too, that, both, men, and, women, practice, the, same, sort, of, virtue, surely, if, there, is, but, one, god, for, both, then, there, is, but, one, educator, for, both, clement, opposed, a, literal, interpretation, of, the, command, sell, what, you, have, and, give, to, the, poor, and, argued, that, the, bible, does, not, command, every, person, to, renounce, all, property, and, that, wealth, can, be, used, either, for, good, or, evil, yet, he, seems, to, have, done, so, tentatively, and, perhaps, reluctantly, to, address, the, concerns, of, upper, class, converts, while, simultaneously, warning, of, the, dangers, of, wealth, clement, believed, that, the, days, mentioned, in, genesis, are, allegorical, clement, assumed, a, double, creation, one, of, an, invisible, world, and, the, second, being, material, creation, he, believed, that, formless, matter, existed, before, the, creation, of, the, world, being, influenced, by, plato, clement, tried, to, interpret, genesis, 6, in, harmony, with, the, book, of, enoch, the, first, person, in, church, history, to, introduce, a, view, of, an, invisible, and, a, visible, church, is, clement, of, alexandria, because, clement, saw, the, protoevangelium, of, james, as, canonical, it, could, imply, he, believed, in, the, perpetual, virginity, of, mary, though, some, have, argued, that, he, does, not, seem, to, believe, in, the, sinlessness, of, mary, clement, of, alexandria, interprets, fire, of, wisdom, which, prevades, the, soul, as, by, a, baptism, clement, of, alexandria, used, the, word, symbol, to, define, the, eucharist, and, interpreted, john, 6, to, be, an, allegory, about, faith, however, his, views, on, real, presence, are, disputed, clement, of, alexandria, was, apparently, an, amillennialist
