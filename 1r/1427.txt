sudski, and, the, first, polish, government, were, distrusted, in, the, west, because, he, had, co, operated, with, the, central, powers, from, 1914, to, 1917, and, because, the, governments, of, daszy, ski, and, moraczewski, were, primarily, socialist, it, was, not, until, january, 1919, when, pianist, and, composer, ignacy, jan, paderewski, became, prime, minister, of, poland, and, foreign, minister, of, a, new, government, that, poland, was, recognized, in, the, west, two, separate, governments, were, claiming, to, be, poland, s, legitimate, government, pi, sudski, s, in, warsaw, and, dmowski, s, in, paris, to, ensure, that, poland, had, a, single, government, and, to, avert, civil, war, paderewski, met, with, dmowski, and, pi, sudski, and, persuaded, them, to, join, forces, with, pi, sudski, acting, as, provisional, chief, of, state, and, commander, in, chief, while, dmowski, and, paderewski, represented, poland, at, the, paris, peace, conference, articles, 87, 93, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, the, little, treaty, of, versailles, signed, on, 28, june, 1919, formally, established, poland, as, an, independent, and, sovereign, state, in, the, international, arena, pi, sudski, often, clashed, with, dmowski, for, viewing, the, poles, as, the, dominant, nationality, in, renascent, poland, and, attempting, to, send, the, blue, army, to, poland, through, danzig, germany, now, gda, sk, poland, on, 5, january, 1919, some, of, dmowski, s, supporters, marian, januszajtis, egota, and, eustachy, sapieha, attempted, a, coup, against, pi, sudski, but, failed, on, 20, february, 1919, polish, parliament, the, sejm, confirmed, his, office, when, it, passed, the, little, constitution, of, 1919, although, pi, sudski, proclaimed, his, intention, to, eventually, relinquish, his, powers, to, the, parliament, provisional, was, struck, from, his, title, and, pi, sudski, held, the, office, of, the, chief, of, state, until, 9, december, 1922, after, gabriel, narutowicz, was, elected, as, the, first, president, of, poland, pi, sudski, s, major, foreign, policy, initiative, was, a, proposed, federation, to, be, called, mi, dzymorze, polish, for, between, seas, and, known, from, the, latin, as, intermarium, stretching, from, the, baltic, sea, to, the, black, sea, in, addition, to, poland, and, lithuania, it, was, to, consist, of, ukraine, belarus, latvia, and, estonia, somewhat, in, emulation, of, the, pre, partition, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, pi, sudski, s, plan, met, with, opposition, from, most, of, the, prospective, member, states, which, refused, to, relinquish, their, independence, as, well, as, the, allied, powers, who, thought, it, to, be, too, bold, a, change, to, the, existing, balance, of, power, structure, according, to, historian, george, sanford, it, was, around, 1920, that, pi, sudski, came, to, realize, the, infeasibility, of, that, version, of, his, intermarium, project, instead, of, a, central, and, eastern, european, alliance, there, soon, appeared, a, series, of, border, conflicts, including, the, polish, ukrainian, war, 1918, 19, the, polish, lithuanian, war, 1919, 1920, culminating, in, eligowski, s, mutiny, polish, czechoslovak, border, conflicts, beginning, in, 1918, and, most, notably, the, polish, soviet, war, 1919, 21, winston, churchill, commented, the, war, of, giants, has, ended, the, wars, of, the, pygmies, have, begun, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, there, was, unrest, on, all, polish, borders, regarding, poland, s, future, frontiers, pi, sudski, said, all, that, we, can, gain, in, the, west, depends, on, the, entente, on, the, extent, to, which, it, may, wish, to, squeeze, germany, the, situation, was, different, in, the, east, of, which, pi, sudski, said, that, there, are, doors, that, open, and, close, and, it, depends, on, who, forces, them, open, and, how, far, in, the, east, polish, forces, clashed, with, ukrainian, forces, in, the, polish, ukrainian, war, and, pi, sudski, s, first, orders, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, polish, army, on, 12, november, 1918, were, to, provide, support, for, the, polish, struggle, in, lviv, pi, sudski, was, aware, that, the, bolsheviks, would, not, ally, with, an, independent, poland, and, predicted, that, war, with, them, was, inevitable, he, viewed, their, advance, west, as, a, major, problem, but, he, also, considered, the, bolsheviks, less, dangerous, for, poland, than, their, white, opponents, the, white, russians, representatives, of, the, old, russian, empire, were, willing, to, accept, limited, independence, for, poland, probably, within, borders, similar, to, those, of, the, former, congress, poland, they, objected, to, polish, control, of, ukraine, which, was, crucial, for, pi, sudski, s, intermarium, project, this, contrasted, with, the, bolsheviks, who, proclaimed, the, partitions, of, poland, null, and, void, pi, sudski, speculated, that, poland, would, be, better, off, with, the, bolsheviks, alienated, from, the, western, powers, than, with, a, restored, russian, empire, by, ignoring, the, strong, pressures, from, the, entente, cordiale, to, join, the, attack, on, lenin, s, struggling, bolshevik, government, pi, sudski, probably, saved, it, in, the, summer, and, the, fall, of, 1919, after, the, soviet, westward, offensive, of, 1918, 1919, and, a, series, of, escalating, battles, that, resulted, in, the, poles, advancing, eastward, on, 21, april, 1920, marshal, pi, sudski, as, his, rank, had, been, since, march, 1920, signed, a, military, alliance, called, the, treaty, of, warsaw, with, ukrainian, leader, symon, petliura, the, treaty, allowed, both, countries, to, conduct, joint, operations, against, soviet, russia, the, goal, of, the, polish, ukrainian, treaty, was, to, establish, an, independent, ukraine, and, independent, poland, in, alliance, resembling, that, once, existing, within, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, the, polish, and, ukrainian, armies, under, pi, sudski, s, command, launched, a, successful, offensive, against, the, russian, forces, in, ukraine, and, on, 7, may, 1920, with, remarkably, little, fighting, they, captured, kiev, the, bolshevik, leadership, framed, the, polish, actions, as, an, invasion, successfully, generating, popular, support, for, their, cause, at, home, the, soviets, then, launched, a, counter, offensive, from, belarus, and, counterattacked, in, ukraine, advancing, into, poland, in, a, drive, toward, germany, to, encourage, the, communist, party, of, germany, in, their, struggles, for, power, the, soviets, announced, their, plans, to, invade, western, europe, soviet, communist, theoretician, nikolai, bukharin, writing, in, pravda, hoped, for, the, resources, to, carry, the, campaign, beyond, warsaw, straight, to, london, and, paris, soviet, commander, mikhail, tukhachevsky, s, order, of, the, day, for, 2, july, 1920, read, to, the, west, over, the, corpse, of, white, poland, lies, the, road, to, worldwide, conflagration, march, upon, vilnius, minsk, warsaw, and, onward, to, berlin, over, the, corpse, of, poland, on, 1, july, 1920, in, view, of, the, rapidly, advancing, soviet, offensive, poland, s, parliament, the, sejm, formed, a, council, for, defense, of, the, nation, chaired, by, pi, sudski, to, provide, expeditious, decision, making, as, a, temporary, supplanting, of, the, fractious, sejm, the, national, democrats, contended, that, the, string, of, bolshevik, victories, had, been, pi, sudski, s, fault, and, demanded, that, he, resign, some, even, accused, him, of, treason, on, 19, july, they, failed, to, carry, a, vote, of, no, confidence, in, the, council, and, this, led, to, dmowski, s, withdrawal, from, the, council, on, 12, august, pi, sudski, tendered, his, resignation, to, prime, minister, wincenty, witos, offering, to, be, the, scapegoat, if, the, military, solution, failed, but, witos, refused, to, accept, his, resignation, the, entente, pressured, poland, to, surrender, and, enter, into, negotiations, with, the, bolsheviks, pi, sudski, however, was, a, staunch, advocate, of, continuing, the, fight, pi, sudski, s, plan, called, for, polish, forces, to, withdraw, across, the, vistula, river, and, to, defend, the, bridgeheads, at, warsaw, and, on, the, wieprz, river, while, some, 25, of, the, available, divisions, concentrated, to, the, south, for, a, counteroffensive, afterwards, two, armies, under, general, j, zef, haller, facing, soviet, frontal, attack, on, warsaw, from, the, east, were, to, hold, their, entrenched, positions, while, an, army, under, general, w, adys, aw, sikorski, was, to, strike, north, from, outside, warsaw, cutting, off, soviet, forces, that, sought, to, envelop, the, polish, capital, from, that, direction, the, most, important, role, of, the, plan, was, assigned, to, a, relatively, small, approximately, 20, 000, man, newly, assembled, reserve, army, also, known, as, the, strike, group, grupa, uderzeniowa, comprising, the, most, determined, battle, hardened, polish, units, that, were, commanded, by, pi, sudski, their, task, was, to, spearhead, a, lightning, northward, offensive, from, the, vistula, wieprz, triangle, south, of, warsaw, through, a, weak, spot, that, had, been, identified, by, polish, intelligence, between, the, soviet, western, and, southwestern, fronts, that, offensive, would, separate, the, soviet, western, front, from, its, reserves, and, disorganize, its, movements, eventually, the, gap, between, sikorski, s, army, and, the, strike, group, would, close, near, the, east, prussian, border, bringing, about, the, destruction, of, the, encircled, soviet, forces, pi, sudski, s, plan, was, criticized, as, amateurish, by, high, ranking, army, officers, and, military, experts, quick, to, point, out, pi, sudski, s, lack, of, formal, military, education, however, the, desperate, situation, of, the, polish, forces, persuaded, other, commanders, to, support, it, when, a, copy, of, the, plan, was, acquired, by, the, soviets, western, front, commander, mikhail, tukhachevsky, thought, it, was, a, ruse, and, disregarded, it, days, later, the, soviets, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, warsaw, halting, the, soviet, advance, in, one, of, the, worst, defeats, for, the, red, army, stanis, aw, stro, ski, a, national, democrat, sejm, deputy, coined, the, phrase, miracle, at, the, vistula, cud, nad, wis, to, express, his, disapproval, of, pi, sudski, s, ukrainian, adventure, stro, ski, s, phrase, was, adopted, as, praise, for, pi, sudski, by, some, patriotically, or, piously, minded, poles, who, were, unaware, of, stro, ski, s, ironic, intent, while, pi, sudski, had, a, major, role, in, crafting, the, war, strategy, he, was, aided, by, others, notably, tadeusz, rozwadowski, later, some, supporters, of, pi, sudski, would, seek, to, portray, him, as, the, sole, author, of, the, polish, strategy, while, his, opponents, would, try, to, minimize, his, role, on, the, other, hand, in, the, west, the, role, of, general, maxime, weygand, of, the, french, military, mission, to, poland, was, for, a, time, exaggerated, in, february, 1921, pi, sudski, visited, paris, where, in, negotiations, with, french, president, alexandre, millerand, he, laid, the, foundations, for, the, franco, polish, alliance, which, would, be, signed, later, that, year, the, treaty, of, riga, ending, the, polish, soviet, war, in, march, 1921, partitioned, belarus, and, ukraine, between, poland, and, russia, pi, sudski, called, the, treaty, an, act, of, cowardice, the, treaty, and, his, secret, approval, of, general, lucjan, eligowski, s, capture, of, vilnius, from, the, lithuanians, marked, an, end, to, this, incarnation, of, pi, sudski, s, federalist, intermarium, plan, after, vilnius, was, occupied, by, the, central, lithuanian, army, pi, sudski, said, that, he, could, not, help, but, regard, them, as, brothers, in, parliament, pi, sudski, once, said, i, cannot, not, reach, out, to, kaunas, i, cannot, disregard, those, brothers, who, consider, the, day, of, our, triumph, a, day, of, shock, and, mourning, on, 25, september, 1921, when, pi, sudski, visited, lw, w, now, lviv, for, the, opening, of, the, first, eastern, trade, fair, targi, wschodnie, he, was, the, target, of, an, unsuccessful, assassination, attempt, by, stepan, fedak, acting, on, behalf, of, ukrainian, independence, organizations, including, the, ukrainian, military, organization, the, polish, constitution, of, march, 1921, severely, limited, the, powers, of, the, presidency, intentionally, to, prevent, pi, sudski, from, waging, war, this, caused, pi, sudski, to, decline, to, run, for, the, office, in, the, run, up, to, the, first, presidential, election, a, parliamentary, election, was, held, in, which, pi, sudski, endorsed, two, lists, the, national, state, union, and, the, state, unity, in, the, kresy, neither, of, which, secured, any, seats, in, the, sejm, on, 9, december, 1922, the, polish, national, assembly, elected, gabriel, narutowicz, of, polish, people, s, party, wyzwolenie, his, election, opposed, by, the, right, wing, parties, caused, public, unrest, on, 14, december, at, the, belweder, palace, pi, sudski, officially, transferred, his, powers, as, chief, of, state, to, his, friend, narutowicz, the, naczelnik, was, replaced, by, the, president, two, days, later, on, 16, december, 1922, narutowicz, was, shot, dead, by, a, right, wing, painter, and, art, critic, eligiusz, niewiadomski, who, had, originally, wanted, to, kill, pi, sudski, but, had, changed, his, target, influenced, by, national, democrat, anti, narutowicz, propaganda, for, pi, sudski, that, was, a, major, shock, he, started, to, doubt, that, poland, could, function, as, a, democracy, and, supported, a, government, led, by, a, strong, leader, he, became, chief, of, the, general, staff, and, together, with, minister, of, military, affairs, w, adys, aw, sikorski, quelled, the, unrest, by, instituting, a, state, of, emergency, stanis, aw, wojciechowski, of, polish, people, s, party, piast, psl, piast, another, of, pi, sudski, s, old, colleagues, was, elected, the, new, president, and, wincenty, witos, also, of, psl, piast, became, prime, minister, the, new, government, an, alliance, among, the, centrist, psl, piast, the, right, wing, popular, national, union, and, christian, democrat, parties, contained, right, wing, enemies, of, pi, sudski, he, held, them, responsible, for, narutowicz, s, death, and, declared, that, it, was, impossible, to, work, with, them, on, 30, may, 1923, pi, sudski, resigned, as, chief, of, the, general, staff, pi, sudski, criticized, general, stanis, aw, szeptycki, s, proposal, that, the, military, should, be, supervised, by, civilians, as, an, attempt, to, politicize, the, army, and, on, 28, june, he, resigned, his, last, political, appointment, the, same, day, the, sejm, s, left, wing, deputies, voted, for, a, resolution, thanking, him, for, his, work, pi, sudski, went, into, retirement, in, sulej, wek, outside, warsaw, at, his, country, manor, milusin, presented, to, him, by, his, former, soldiers, there, he, wrote, a, series, of, political, and, military, memoirs, including, rok, 1920, the, year, 1920, meanwhile, poland, s, economy, was, a, shambles, hyperinflation, fueled, public, unrest, and, the, government, was, unable, to, find, a, quick, solution, to, the, mounting, unemployment, and, economic, crisis, pi, sudski, s, allies, and, supporters, repeatedly, asked, him, to, return, to, politics, and, he, began, to, create, a, new, power, base, centred, on, former, members, of, the, polish, legions, the, polish, military, organization, and, some, left, wing, and, intelligentsia, parties, in, 1925, after, several, governments, had, resigned, in, short, order, and, the, political, scene, was, becoming, increasingly, chaotic, pi, sudski, became, more, and, more, critical, of, the, government, and, eventually, issued, statements, demanding, the, resignation, of, the, witos, cabinet, when, the, chjeno, piast, coalition, which, pi, sudski, had, strongly, criticized, formed, a, new, government, on, 12, 14, may, 1926, pi, sudski, returned, to, power, in, the, may, coup, supported, by, the, polish, socialist, party, liberation, the, peasant, party, and, the, communist, party, of, poland, pi, sudski, had, hoped, for, a, bloodless, coup, but, the, government, had, refused, to, surrender, 215, soldiers, and, 164, civilians, had, been, killed, and, over, 900, persons, had, been, wounded, on, 31, may, 1926, the, sejm, elected, pi, sudski, president, of, the, republic, but, pi, sudski, refused, the, office, due, to, the, presidency, s, limited, powers, another, of, his, old, friends, ignacy, mo, cicki, was, elected, in, his, stead, mo, cicki, then, appointed, pi, sudski, as, minister, of, military, affairs, defence, minister, a, post, he, held, for, the, rest, of, his, life, through, eleven, successive, governments, two, of, which, he, headed, from, 1926, to, 1928, and, for, a, brief, period, in, 1930, he, also, served, as, general, inspector, of, the, armed, forces, and, chairman, of, the, war, council, pi, sudski, had, no, plans, for, major, reforms, he, quickly, distanced, himself, from, the, most, radical, of, his, left, wing, supporters, and, declared, that, his, coup, was, to, be, a, revolution, without, revolutionary, consequences, his, goals, were, to, stabilize, the, country, reduce, the, influence, of, political, parties, which, he, blamed, for, corruption, and, inefficiency, and, strengthen, the, army, his, role, in, the, polish, government, over, the, subsequent, years, has, been, called, a, dictatorship, or, a, quasi, dictatorship, pi, sudski, s, coup, entailed, sweeping, limitations, on, parliamentary, government, as, his, sanation, regime, 1926, 1939, at, times, employing, authoritarian, methods, sought, to, curb, perceived, corruption, and, incompetence, of, the, parliament, rule, and, in, pi, sudski, s, words, restore, moral, health, to, public, life, hence, the, name, of, his, faction, sanation, which, could, be, understood, as, moral, purification, from, 1928, the, sanation, authorities, were, represented, by, the, non, partisan, bloc, for, cooperation, with, the, government, bbwr, popular, support, and, an, effective, propaganda, apparatus, allowed, pi, sudski, to, maintain, his, authoritarian, powers, which, could, not, be, overruled, either, by, the, president, who, was, appointed, by, pi, sudski, or, by, the, sejm, the, powers, of, the, sejm, were, curtailed, by, constitutional, amendments, that, were, introduced, soon, after, the, coup, on, 2, august, 1926, from, 1926, to, 1930, pi, sudski, relied, chiefly, on, propaganda, to, weaken, the, influence, of, opposition, leaders, the, culmination, of, his, dictatorial, and, supralegal, policies, came, in, the, 1930s, with, the, imprisonment, and, trial, of, political, opponents, the, brest, trials, on, the, eve, of, the, 1930, polish, legislative, election, and, with, the, 1934, establishment, of, the, bereza, kartuska, detention, camp, for, political, prisoners, in, present, day, biaroza, where, some, prisoners, were, brutally, mistreated, after, the, bbwr, s, 1930, victory, pi, sudski, allowed, most, internal, matters, to, be, decided, by, his, colonels, while, he, concentrated, on, military, and, foreign, affairs, his, treatment, of, political, opponents, and, their, 1930, arrest, and, imprisonment, was, internationally, condemned, and, the, events, damaged, poland, s, reputation, pi, sudski, became, increasingly, disillusioned, with, democracy, in, poland, his, intemperate, public, utterances, he, called, the, sejm, a, prostitute, and, his, sending, of, 90, armed, officers, into, the, sejm, building, in, response, to, an, impending, vote, of, no, confidence, caused, concern, in, contemporary, and, modern, observers, who, have, seen, his, actions, as, setting, precedents, for, authoritarian, responses, to, political, challenges, he, sought, to, transform, the, parliamentary, system, into, a, presidential, system, however, he, opposed, the, introduction, of, totalitarianism, the, adoption, of, a, new, polish, constitution, in, april, 1935, was, tailored, by, pi, sudski, s, supporters, to, his, specifications, providing, for, a, strong, presidency, but, the, april, constitution, served, poland, until, world, war, ii, and, carried, its, government, in, exile, until, the, end, of, the, war, and, beyond, pi, sudski, s, government, depended, more, on, his, charismatic, authority, than, on, rational, legal, authority, none, of, his, followers, could, claim, to, be, his, legitimate, heir, and, after, his, death, the, sanation, structure, would, quickly, fracture, returning, poland, to, the, pre, pi, sudski, era, of, parliamentary, political, contention, pi, sudski, s, regime, began, a, period, of, national, stabilization, and, of, improvement, in, the, situation, of, ethnic, minorities, which, formed, about, a, third, of, the, second, republic, s, population, pi, sudski, replaced, the, national, democrats, ethnic, assimilation, with, a, state, assimilation, policy, citizens, were, judged, not, by, their, ethnicity, but, by, their, loyalty, to, the, state, widely, recognized, for, his, opposition, to, the, national, democrats, anti, semitic, policies, he, extended, his, policy, of, state, assimilation, to, polish, jews, the, years, 1926, to, 1935, and, pi, sudski, himself, were, favorably, viewed, by, many, polish, jews, whose, situation, improved, especially, under, pi, sudski, appointed, prime, minister, kazimierz, bartel, many, jews, saw, pi, sudski, as, their, only, hope, for, restraining, antisemitic, currents, in, poland, and, for, maintaining, public, order, he, was, seen, as, a, guarantor, of, stability, and, a, friend, of, the, jewish, people, who, voted, for, him, and, actively, participated, in, his, political, bloc, pi, sudski, s, death, in, 1935, brought, a, deterioration, in, the, quality, of, life, of, poland, s, jews, during, the, 1930s, a, combination, of, developments, from, the, great, depression, to, the, vicious, spiral, of, oun, terrorist, attacks, and, government, pacifications, caused, government, relations, with, the, national, minorities, to, deteriorate, unrest, among, national, minorities, was, also, related, to, foreign, policy, troubles, followed, repressions, in, the, largely, ukrainian, eastern, galicia, where, nearly, 1, 800, persons, were, arrested, tension, also, arose, between, the, government, and, poland, s, german, minority, particularly, in, upper, silesia, the, government, did, not, yield, to, calls, for, antisemitic, measures, but, the, jews, 8, 6, of, poland, s, population, grew, discontented, for, economic, reasons, that, were, connected, with, the, depression, by, the, end, of, pi, sudski, s, life, his, government, s, relations, with, national, minorities, were, increasingly, problematic, in, the, military, sphere, pi, sudski, was, praised, for, his, plan, at, the, battle, of, warsaw, in, 1920, but, was, criticized, for, subsequently, concentrating, on, personnel, management, and, neglecting, modernization, of, military, strategy, and, equipment, according, to, his, detractors, his, experiences, in, world, war, i, and, the, polish, soviet, war, led, him, to, over, estimate, the, importance, of, cavalry, and, to, neglect, the, development, of, armor, and, air, forces, his, supporters, on, the, other, hand, contend, that, particularly, from, the, late, 1920s, he, supported, the, development, of, these, military, branches, modern, historians, concluded, that, the, limitations, on, poland, s, military, modernization, in, this, period, was, less, doctrinal, than, financial, pi, sudski, sought, to, maintain, his, country, s, independence, in, the, international, arena, assisted, by, his, prot, g, foreign, minister, j, zef, beck, he, sought, support, for, poland, in, alliances, with, western, powers, such, as, france, and, britain, and, with, friendly, neighbors, such, as, romania, and, hungary, a, supporter, of, the, franco, polish, military, alliance, and, the, polish, romanian, alliance, part, of, the, little, entente, pi, sudski, was, disappointed, by, the, policy, of, appeasement, pursued, by, the, french, and, british, governments, evident, in, their, signing, of, the, locarno, treaties, the, locarno, treaties, were, intended, by, the, british, government, to, ensure, a, peaceful, handover, the, territories, claimed, by, germany, such, as, the, sudetenland, the, polish, corridor, and, the, free, city, of, danzig, modern, gda, sk, poland, by, improving, franco, german, relations, to, such, extent, that, france, would, dissolve, its, alliances, in, eastern, europe, pi, sudski, aimed, to, maintain, good, relations, with, the, soviet, union, and, germany, and, relations, with, germany, and, the, soviet, union, during, pi, sudski, s, tenure, could, for, the, most, part, be, described, as, neutral, under, pi, sudski, poland, maintained, good, relations, with, neighboring, romania, hungary, and, latvia, but, were, strained, with, czechoslovakia, and, worse, with, lithuania, a, recurring, fear, of, pi, sudski, was, that, france, would, reach, an, agreement, with, germany, at, the, expense, of, poland, in, 1929, the, french, agreed, to, pull, out, of, the, rhineland, in, 1930, five, years, earlier, than, what, the, treaty, of, versailles, called, the, same, year, the, french, announced, plans, for, the, maginot, line, along, the, border, with, germany, and, construction, of, the, maginot, line, began, in, 1930, the, maginot, line, was, a, tacit, french, admission, that, germany, would, be, rearming, beyond, the, limits, set, by, the, treaty, of, versailles, in, the, near, future, and, that, france, intended, to, pursue, a, defensive, strategy, at, the, time, poland, signed, the, alliance, with, france, in, 1921, the, french, were, occupying, the, rhineland, and, polish, plans, for, a, possible, war, with, reich, were, based, on, the, assumption, of, a, french, offensive, into, the, north, german, plain, from, their, bases, in, the, rhineland, the, french, pullout, from, the, rhineland, and, a, shift, to, a, defensive, strategy, as, epitomized, by, the, magniot, line, completely, upset, the, entire, basis, of, polish, foreign, and, defense, policy, in, june, 1932, just, before, the, lausanne, conference, opened, pi, sudski, heard, reports, that, the, new, german, chancellor, franz, von, papen, was, about, to, make, an, offer, for, a, franco, german, alliance, to, the, french, premier, douard, herriot, which, would, be, at, the, expense, of, poland, in, response, pi, sudski, sent, the, destroyer, orp, wicher, into, the, harbour, of, danzig, though, the, issue, was, ostensibly, about, access, rights, for, the, polish, navy, in, danzig, the, real, purpose, of, sending, wircher, was, as, a, way, to, warn, herriot, not, to, disadvantage, poland, in, a, deal, with, papen, the, ensuring, danzig, crisis, sent, the, desired, message, to, the, french, and, improved, the, polish, navy, s, access, rights, to, danzig, poland, signed, the, soviet, polish, non, aggression, pact, in, 1932, critics, of, the, pact, state, that, it, allowed, stalin, to, eliminate, his, socialist, opponents, primarily, in, ukraine, the, pacts, were, supported, by, advocates, of, pi, sudski, s, promethean, programme, after, adolf, hitler, came, to, power, in, germany, in, january, 1933, pi, sudski, is, rumored, to, have, proposed, to, france, a, preventive, war, against, germany, lack, of, french, enthusiasm, may, have, been, a, reason, for, poland, signing, the, german, polish, non, aggression, pact, in, 1934, little, evidence, has, however, been, found, in, french, or, polish, diplomatic, archives, that, such, a, proposal, for, preventive, war, was, ever, actually, advanced, critics, of, poland, s, pact, with, germany, accused, pi, sudski, of, underestimating, hitler, s, aggressiveness, and, giving, germany, time, to, re, arm, hitler, repeatedly, suggested, a, german, polish, alliance, against, the, soviet, union, but, pi, sudski, declined, instead, seeking, precious, time, to, prepare, for, a, potential, war, with, either, germany, or, the, soviet, union, just, before, his, death, pi, sudski, told, j, zef, beck, that, it, must, be, poland, s, policy, to, maintain, neutral, relations, with, germany, keep, up, the, polish, alliance, with, france, and, improve, relations, with, the, united, kingdom, the, two, non, aggression, pacts, were, intended, to, strengthen, poland, s, position, in, the, eyes, of, its, allies, and, neighbors, pi, sudski, was, probably, aware, of, the, weakness, of, the, pacts, stating, having, these, pacts, we, are, straddling, two, stools, this, cannot, last, long, we, have, to, know, from, which, stool, we, will, tumble, first, and, when, that, will, be, despite, coming, from, a, socialist, background, and, initially, implementing, socialist, reforms, pi, sudski, s, regime, followed, the, conservative, free, market, economic, tradition, of, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, throughout, its, existence, poland, had, one, of, the, lowest, taxation, rates, in, europe, with, 9, 3, of, taxes, as, a, distribution, of, national, income, pi, sudski, s, regime, was, also, heavily, dependent, on, foreign, investments, and, economies, with, 45, 4, of, polish, equity, capital, controlled, by, foreign, corporations, after, the, great, depression, the, polish, economy, crumbled, and, failed, to, recover, until, ignacy, mo, cicki, s, government, introduced, economic, reforms, with, more, government, interventions, with, an, increase, in, tax, revenues, and, public, spending, after, pi, sudski, s, death, these, interventionist, policies, saw, poland, s, economy, recover, from, the, recession,
