svante, august, arrhenius, formemrs, r, i, n, i, s, r, e, n, i, s, ree, nee, s, ray, swedish, 19, february, 1859, 2, october, 1927, was, a, swedish, scientist, originally, a, physicist, but, often, referred, to, as, a, chemist, arrhenius, was, one, of, the, founders, of, the, science, of, physical, chemistry, he, received, the, nobel, prize, for, chemistry, in, 1903, becoming, the, first, swedish, nobel, laureate, in, 1905, he, became, the, director, of, the, nobel, institute, where, he, remained, until, his, death, arrhenius, was, the, first, to, use, the, principles, of, physical, chemistry, to, estimate, the, extent, to, which, increases, in, the, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, are, responsible, for, the, earth, s, increasing, surface, temperature, his, work, played, an, important, role, in, the, emergence, of, modern, climate, science, in, the, 1960s, charles, david, keeling, reliably, measured, the, level, of, carbon, dioxide, present, in, the, air, showing, it, was, increasing, and, that, according, to, the, greenhouse, hypothesis, it, was, sufficient, to, cause, significant, global, warming, the, arrhenius, equation, arrhenius, acid, arrhenius, base, lunar, crater, arrhenius, martian, crater, arrhenius, the, mountain, of, arrheniusfjellet, and, the, arrhenius, labs, at, stockholm, university, were, so, named, to, commemorate, his, contributions, to, science, arrhenius, was, born, on, 19, february, 1859, at, vik, also, spelled, wik, or, wijk, near, uppsala, kingdom, of, sweden, the, son, of, svante, gustav, and, carolina, thunberg, arrhenius, who, were, lutheran, his, father, had, been, a, land, surveyor, for, uppsala, university, moving, up, to, a, supervisory, position, at, the, age, of, three, arrhenius, taught, himself, to, read, without, the, encouragement, of, his, parents, and, by, watching, his, father, s, addition, of, numbers, in, his, account, books, became, an, arithmetical, prodigy, in, later, life, arrhenius, was, profoundly, passionate, about, mathematical, concepts, data, analysis, and, discovering, their, relationships, and, laws, at, age, eight, he, entered, the, local, cathedral, school, starting, in, the, fifth, grade, distinguishing, himself, in, physics, and, mathematics, and, graduating, as, the, youngest, and, most, able, student, in, 1876, at, the, university, of, uppsala, he, was, dissatisfied, with, the, chief, instructor, of, physics, and, the, only, faculty, member, who, could, have, supervised, him, in, chemistry, per, teodor, cleve, so, he, left, to, study, at, the, physical, institute, of, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, stockholm, under, the, physicist, erik, edlund, in, 1881, his, work, focused, on, the, conductivities, of, electrolytes, in, 1884, based, on, this, work, he, submitted, a, 150, page, dissertation, on, electrolytic, conductivity, to, uppsala, for, the, doctorate, it, did, not, impress, the, professors, who, included, cleve, and, he, received, a, fourth, class, degree, but, upon, his, defense, it, was, reclassified, as, third, class, later, extensions, of, this, very, work, would, earn, him, the, 1903, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, arrhenius, put, forth, 56, theses, in, his, 1884, dissertation, most, of, which, would, still, be, accepted, today, unchanged, or, with, minor, modifications, the, most, important, idea, in, the, dissertation, was, his, explanation, of, the, fact, that, solid, crystalline, salts, disassociate, into, paired, charged, particles, when, dissolved, for, which, he, would, win, the, 1903, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, arrhenius, s, explanation, was, that, in, forming, a, solution, the, salt, disassociates, into, charged, particles, that, michael, faraday, had, given, the, name, ions, many, years, earlier, faraday, s, belief, had, been, that, ions, were, produced, in, the, process, of, electrolysis, that, is, an, external, direct, current, source, of, electricity, was, necessary, to, form, ions, arrhenius, proposed, that, even, in, the, absence, of, an, electric, current, aqueous, solutions, of, salts, contained, ions, he, thus, proposed, that, chemical, reactions, in, solution, were, reactions, between, ions, the, dissertation, did, not, impress, the, professors, at, uppsala, but, arrhenius, sent, it, to, a, number, of, scientists, in, europe, who, were, developing, the, new, science, of, physical, chemistry, such, as, rudolf, clausius, wilhelm, ostwald, and, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, they, were, far, more, impressed, and, ostwald, even, came, to, uppsala, to, persuade, arrhenius, to, join, his, research, team, in, riga, arrhenius, declined, however, as, he, preferred, to, stay, in, sweden, norway, for, a, while, his, father, was, very, ill, and, would, die, in, 1885, and, had, received, an, appointment, at, uppsala, in, an, extension, of, his, ionic, theory, arrhenius, proposed, definitions, for, acids, and, bases, in, 1884, he, believed, that, acids, were, substances, that, produce, hydrogen, ions, in, solution, and, that, bases, were, substances, that, produce, hydroxide, ions, in, solution, in, 1885, arrhenius, next, received, a, travel, grant, from, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, which, enabled, him, to, study, with, ostwald, in, riga, now, in, latvia, with, friedrich, kohlrausch, in, w, rzburg, germany, with, ludwig, boltzmann, in, graz, austria, and, with, jacobus, henricus, van, t, hoff, in, amsterdam, in, 1889, arrhenius, explained, the, fact, that, most, reactions, require, added, heat, energy, to, proceed, by, formulating, the, concept, of, activation, energy, an, energy, barrier, that, must, be, overcome, before, two, molecules, will, react, the, arrhenius, equation, gives, the, quantitative, basis, of, the, relationship, between, the, activation, energy, and, the, rate, at, which, a, reaction, proceeds, in, 1891, he, became, a, lecturer, at, the, stockholm, university, college, stockholms, h, gskola, now, stockholm, university, being, promoted, to, professor, of, physics, with, much, opposition, in, 1895, and, rector, in, 1896, about, 1900, arrhenius, became, involved, in, setting, up, the, nobel, institutes, and, the, nobel, prizes, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, in, 1901, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, would, be, a, member, of, the, nobel, committee, on, physics, and, a, de, facto, member, of, the, nobel, committee, on, chemistry, he, used, his, positions, to, arrange, prizes, for, his, friends, jacobus, van, t, hoff, wilhelm, ostwald, theodore, richards, and, to, attempt, to, deny, them, to, his, enemies, paul, ehrlich, walther, nernst, dmitri, mendeleev, in, 1901, arrhenius, was, elected, to, the, swedish, academy, of, sciences, against, strong, opposition, in, 1903, he, became, the, first, swede, to, be, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1905, upon, the, founding, of, the, nobel, institute, for, physical, research, at, stockholm, he, was, appointed, rector, of, the, institute, the, position, where, he, remained, until, retirement, in, 1927, in, 1911, he, won, the, first, willard, gibbs, award, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1908, he, was, elected, an, honorary, member, of, the, netherlands, chemical, society, in, 1909, he, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1910, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1911, in, 1912, he, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1919, he, became, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, eventually, arrhenius, s, theories, became, generally, accepted, and, he, turned, to, other, scientific, topics, in, 1902, he, began, to, investigate, physiological, problems, in, terms, of, chemical, theory, he, determined, that, reactions, in, living, organisms, and, in, the, test, tube, followed, the, same, laws, in, 1904, he, delivered, at, the, university, of, california, a, course, of, lectures, the, object, of, which, was, to, illustrate, the, application, of, the, methods, of, physical, chemistry, to, the, study, of, the, theory, of, toxins, and, antitoxins, and, which, were, published, in, 1907, under, the, title, immunochemistry, he, also, turned, his, attention, to, geology, the, origin, of, ice, ages, astronomy, physical, cosmology, and, astrophysics, accounting, for, the, birth, of, the, solar, system, by, interstellar, collision, he, considered, radiation, pressure, as, accounting, for, comets, the, solar, corona, the, aurora, borealis, and, zodiacal, light, he, thought, life, might, have, been, carried, from, planet, to, planet, by, the, transport, of, spores, the, theory, now, known, as, panspermia, he, thought, of, the, idea, of, a, universal, language, proposing, a, modification, of, the, english, language, he, was, a, board, member, for, the, swedish, society, for, racial, hygiene, founded, 1909, which, endorsed, mendelism, at, the, time, and, contributed, to, the, topic, of, contraceptives, around, 1910, however, until, 1938, information, and, sale, of, contraceptives, was, prohibited, in, the, kingdom, of, sweden, gordon, stein, wrote, that, svante, arrhenius, was, an, atheist, in, his, last, years, he, wrote, both, textbooks, and, popular, books, trying, to, emphasize, the, need, for, further, work, on, the, topics, he, discussed, in, september, 1927, he, came, down, with, an, attack, of, acute, intestinal, catarrh, and, died, on, 2, october, he, was, buried, in, uppsala, he, was, married, twice, first, to, his, former, pupil, sofia, rudbeck, 1894, 1896, with, whom, he, had, one, son, olof, arrhenius, and, then, to, maria, johansson, 1905, 1927, with, whom, he, had, two, daughters, and, a, son, arrhenius, was, the, grandfather, of, bacteriologist, agnes, wold, chemist, svante, wold, and, ocean, biogeochemist, gustaf, arrhenius, in, developing, a, theory, to, explain, the, ice, ages, arrhenius, in, 1896, was, the, first, to, use, basic, principles, of, physical, chemistry, to, calculate, estimates, of, the, extent, to, which, increases, in, atmospheric, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, will, increase, earth, s, surface, temperature, through, the, greenhouse, effect, these, calculations, led, him, to, conclude, that, human, caused, co, 2, emissions, from, fossil, fuel, burning, and, other, combustion, processes, are, large, enough, to, cause, global, warming, this, conclusion, has, been, extensively, tested, winning, a, place, at, the, core, of, modern, climate, science, arrhenius, in, this, work, built, upon, the, prior, work, of, other, famous, scientists, including, joseph, fourier, john, tyndall, and, claude, pouillet, arrhenius, wanted, to, determine, whether, greenhouse, gases, could, contribute, to, the, explanation, of, the, temperature, variation, between, glacial, and, inter, glacial, periods, arrhenius, used, infrared, observations, of, the, moon, by, frank, washington, very, and, samuel, pierpont, langley, at, the, allegheny, observatory, in, pittsburgh, to, calculate, how, much, of, infrared, heat, radiation, is, captured, by, co, 2, and, water, h, 2, o, vapour, in, earth, s, atmosphere, using, stefan, s, law, better, known, as, the, stefan, boltzmann, law, he, formulated, what, he, referred, to, as, a, rule, in, its, original, form, arrhenius, s, rule, reads, as, follows, here, arrhenius, refers, to, co, 2, as, carbonic, acid, which, refers, only, to, the, aqueous, form, h, 2, co, 3, in, modern, usage, the, following, formulation, of, arrhenius, s, rule, is, still, in, use, today, where, c, 0, displaystyle, c, 0, is, the, concentration, of, co, 2, at, the, beginning, time, zero, of, the, period, being, studied, if, the, same, concentration, unit, is, used, for, both, c, displaystyle, c, and, c, 0, displaystyle, c, 0, then, it, doesn, t, matter, which, concentration, unit, is, used, c, displaystyle, c, is, the, co, 2, concentration, at, end, of, the, period, being, studied, ln, is, the, natural, logarithm, log, base, e, log, e, and, f, displaystyle, delta, f, is, the, augmentation, of, the, temperature, in, other, words, the, change, in, the, rate, of, heating, earth, s, surface, radiative, forcing, which, is, measured, in, watts, per, square, meter, derivations, from, atmospheric, radiative, transfer, models, have, found, that, displaystyle, alpha, alpha, for, co, 2, is, 5, 35, 10, w, m, 2, for, earth, s, atmosphere, based, on, information, from, his, colleague, arvid, h, gbom, arrhenius, was, the, first, person, to, predict, that, emissions, of, carbon, dioxide, from, the, burning, of, fossil, fuels, and, other, combustion, processes, were, large, enough, to, cause, global, warming, in, his, calculation, arrhenius, included, the, feedback, from, changes, in, water, vapor, as, well, as, latitudinal, effects, but, he, omitted, clouds, convection, of, heat, upward, in, the, atmosphere, and, other, essential, factors, his, work, is, currently, seen, less, as, an, accurate, quantification, of, global, warming, than, as, the, first, demonstration, that, increases, in, atmospheric, co, 2, will, cause, global, warming, everything, else, being, equal, arrhenius, s, absorption, values, for, co, 2, and, his, conclusions, met, criticism, by, knut, ngstr, m, in, 1900, who, published, the, first, modern, infrared, absorption, spectrum, of, co, 2, with, two, absorption, bands, and, published, experimental, results, that, seemed, to, show, that, absorption, of, infrared, radiation, by, the, gas, in, the, atmosphere, was, already, saturated, so, that, adding, more, could, make, no, difference, arrhenius, replied, strongly, in, 1901, annalen, der, physik, dismissing, the, critique, altogether, he, touched, on, the, subject, briefly, in, a, technical, book, titled, lehrbuch, der, kosmischen, physik, 1903, he, later, wrote, v, rldarnas, utveckling, 1906, german, das, werden, der, welten, english, worlds, in, the, making, directed, at, a, general, audience, where, he, suggested, that, the, human, emission, of, co, 2, would, be, strong, enough, to, prevent, the, world, from, entering, a, new, ice, age, and, that, a, warmer, earth, would, be, needed, to, feed, the, rapidly, increasing, population, at, this, time, the, accepted, consensus, explanation, is, that, historically, orbital, forcing, has, set, the, timing, for, ice, ages, with, co, 2, acting, as, an, essential, amplifying, feedback, however, co, 2, releases, since, the, industrial, revolution, have, increased, co, 2, to, a, level, not, found, since, 10, to, 15, million, years, ago, when, the, global, average, surface, temperature, was, up, to, 6, c, 11, f, warmer, than, now, and, almost, all, ice, had, melted, raising, world, sea, levels, to, about, 100, feet, 30, m, higher, than, today, s, arrhenius, estimated, based, on, the, co, 2, levels, at, his, time, that, reducing, levels, by, 0, 62, 0, 55, would, decrease, temperatures, by, 4, 5, c, celsius, and, an, increase, of, 2, 5, to, 3, times, of, co, 2, would, cause, a, temperature, rise, of, 8, 9, c, in, the, arctic, in, his, book, worlds, in, the, making, he, described, the, hot, house, theory, of, the, atmosphere
