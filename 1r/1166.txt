clovis, latin, chlodovechus, reconstructed, frankish, hl, dowig, c, 466, 27, november, 511, was, the, first, king, of, the, franks, to, unite, all, of, the, franks, under, one, ruler, changing, the, form, of, leadership, from, a, group, of, petty, kings, to, rule, by, a, single, king, and, ensuring, that, the, kingship, was, passed, down, to, his, heirs, he, is, considered, to, have, been, the, founder, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, which, ruled, the, frankish, kingdom, for, the, next, two, centuries, clovis, is, important, in, the, historiography, of, france, as, the, first, king, of, what, would, become, france, clovis, succeeded, his, father, childeric, i, as, a, king, of, the, salian, franks, in, 481, and, eventually, came, to, rule, an, area, extending, from, what, is, now, the, southern, netherlands, to, northern, france, corresponding, in, roman, terms, to, gallia, belgica, northern, gaul, at, the, battle, of, soissons, 486, he, established, his, military, dominance, of, the, rump, state, of, the, fragmenting, western, roman, empire, which, was, then, under, the, command, of, syagrius, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, 511, clovis, had, conquered, several, smaller, frankish, kingdoms, in, the, northeast, of, gaul, stretching, into, what, is, now, germany, clovis, also, conquered, the, alemanni, in, eastern, gaul, and, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, aquitania, in, the, southwest, these, campaigns, added, significantly, to, clovis, s, domains, and, established, his, dynasty, as, a, major, political, and, military, presence, in, western, europe, clovis, is, also, significant, because, of, his, baptism, in, 508, largely, at, the, behest, of, his, wife, clotilde, who, would, later, be, venerated, as, a, saint, for, this, act, celebrated, today, in, both, the, catholic, church, and, eastern, orthodox, church, the, adoption, by, clovis, of, nicene, christianity, as, opposed, to, the, arianism, of, most, other, germanic, tribes, led, to, widespread, conversion, among, the, franks, and, eventually, to, religious, unification, across, what, is, now, modern, day, france, the, low, countries, and, germany, the, alliance, between, the, franks, and, catholicism, eventually, led, to, charlemagne, s, crowning, by, the, pope, as, emperor, in, 800, and, to, the, subsequent, birth, of, the, early, holy, roman, empire, in, the, middle, of, the, 10th, century, based, on, the, attested, forms, the, original, name, is, reconstructed, in, the, frankish, language, as, hl, dowik, or, hl, dowig, and, is, traditionally, considered, to, be, composed, of, two, elements, deriving, from, both, proto, germanic, hl, daz, loud, famous, and, wigan, to, battle, to, fight, resulting, in, the, traditional, practice, of, translating, clovis, name, as, meaning, famous, warrior, or, renowned, in, battle, however, scholars, have, pointed, out, that, gregory, of, tours, consequently, transcribes, the, names, of, various, merovingian, royal, names, containing, the, first, element, as, chlodo, the, use, of, a, close, mid, back, rounded, vowel, o, rather, than, the, expected, close, back, rounded, vowel, u, that, gregory, does, use, in, various, other, germanic, names, i, e, fredegundis, arnulfus, gundobadus, etc, opens, up, the, possibility, that, the, first, element, instead, derives, from, proto, germanic, hlut, lot, share, portion, giving, the, meaning, of, the, name, as, loot, bringer, or, plunder, bringing, warrior, this, hypothesis, is, supported, by, the, fact, that, if, the, first, element, is, taken, to, mean, famous, then, the, name, of, chlodomer, one, of, clovis, sons, would, contain, two, elements, hl, daz, and, m, rijaz, both, meaning, famous, which, would, be, highly, uncommon, within, the, typical, germanic, name, structure, in, middle, dutch, a, language, closely, related, to, frankish, the, name, was, rendered, as, lodewijch, cf, modern, dutch, lodewijk, the, name, is, found, in, other, west, germanic, languages, with, cognates, including, old, english, hlo, wig, old, saxon, hluduco, and, old, high, german, hludw, g, variant, hluotw, g, the, latter, turned, into, ludwig, in, modern, german, although, the, king, clovis, himself, is, generally, named, chlodwig, the, old, norse, form, hl, v, r, was, most, likely, borrowed, from, a, west, germanic, language, the, frankish, name, hlodowig, is, at, the, origin, of, the, french, given, name, louis, variant, ludovic, borne, by, 18, kings, of, france, via, the, latinized, form, hludovicus, variants, ludhovicus, lodhuvicus, or, chlodovicus, the, english, lewis, stems, from, the, anglo, french, louis, clovis, was, the, son, of, childeric, i, a, merovingian, king, of, the, salian, franks, and, basina, a, thuringian, princess, the, dynasty, he, founded, is, however, named, after, his, supposed, ancestor, merovech, some, sources, claim, that, clovis, grandfather, was, chlodio, but, his, exact, relation, with, merovech, is, not, known, numerous, small, frankish, petty, kingdoms, existed, during, the, 5th, century, the, salian, franks, was, the, first, known, frankish, tribe, that, settled, with, official, roman, permission, within, the, empire, first, in, batavia, in, the, rhine, maas, delta, and, then, in, 375, in, toxandria, which, in, the, present, day, consists, of, the, province, of, north, brabant, in, the, netherlands, and, parts, of, neighbouring, provinces, of, antwerp, and, limburg, in, belgium, this, put, them, in, the, northern, part, of, the, roman, civitas, tungrorum, with, the, romanized, population, still, dominant, south, of, the, military, highway, boulogne, cologne, later, chlodio, seems, to, have, attacked, westwards, from, this, area, to, take, control, of, the, roman, populations, in, tournai, then, southwards, to, artois, and, cambrai, eventually, controlling, an, area, stretching, to, the, somme, river, childeric, i, clovis, s, father, was, reputed, to, be, a, relative, of, chlodio, and, was, known, as, the, king, of, the, franks, who, fought, as, an, army, within, northern, gaul, in, 463, he, fought, in, conjunction, with, aegidius, the, magister, militum, of, northern, gaul, to, defeat, the, visigoths, in, orl, ans, childeric, died, in, 481, and, was, buried, in, tournai, clovis, succeeded, him, as, king, aged, just, 15, historians, believe, that, childeric, and, clovis, were, both, commanders, of, the, roman, military, in, the, province, of, belgica, secunda, and, were, subordinate, to, the, magister, militum, the, franks, of, tournai, came, to, dominate, their, neighbours, initially, aided, by, the, association, with, aegidius, the, death, of, aetius, in, 454, led, to, the, decline, of, imperial, power, in, gaul, leaving, the, visigoths, and, the, burgundians, competing, for, predominance, in, the, area, the, part, of, gaul, still, under, roman, control, emerged, as, a, kingdom, under, syagrius, aegidius, s, son, though, no, primary, sources, expounding, on, the, language, spoken, by, clovis, exist, historical, linguists, consider, it, likely, that, based, on, his, family, history, and, core, territories, he, spoke, a, form, of, old, dutch, in, this, the, early, merovingians, can, be, contrasted, with, the, later, carolingians, such, as, charlemagne, of, the, late, 8th, century, and, onward, who, probably, spoke, various, forms, of, old, high, german, the, ruler, of, tournai, died, in, 481, and, was, succeeded, by, his, young, son, clovis, his, band, of, warriors, probably, numbered, no, more, than, half, a, thousand, in, 486, he, began, his, efforts, to, expand, the, realm, by, allying, himself, with, his, relative, ragnachar, king, of, cambrai, and, another, frankish, king, chalaric, these, rulers, are, sometimes, referred, to, as, regulus, diminutive, of, rex, together, the, triumvirate, marched, against, syagrius, and, met, the, gallo, roman, commander, at, soissons, during, the, battle, chalaric, betrayed, his, comrades, by, refusing, to, take, part, in, the, fighting, despite, the, betrayal, the, franks, landed, a, decisive, victory, forcing, syagrius, to, flee, to, the, court, of, alaric, ii, this, battle, is, viewed, as, bringing, about, the, end, of, the, rump, state, of, the, western, roman, empire, outside, of, italy, following, the, battle, clovis, invaded, the, traitor, chalaric, s, territory, and, was, able, to, imprison, him, and, his, son, prior, to, the, battle, clovis, did, not, enjoy, the, support, of, the, gallo, roman, clergy, so, he, proceeded, to, pillage, the, roman, territory, including, the, churches, the, bishop, of, reims, requested, clovis, return, everything, taken, from, the, church, of, reims, the, young, king, aspired, to, establish, cordial, relationships, with, the, clergy, so, he, returned, a, valuable, ewer, taken, from, the, church, despite, his, position, some, roman, cities, refused, to, yield, to, the, franks, namely, verdun, which, surrendered, after, a, brief, siege, and, paris, which, stubbornly, resisted, a, few, years, perhaps, as, many, as, five, he, made, paris, his, capital, and, established, an, abbey, dedicated, to, saints, peter, and, paul, on, the, south, bank, of, the, seine, realizing, that, he, would, not, be, able, to, rule, gaul, without, the, help, of, the, clergy, clovis, took, a, nicene, christian, wife, to, please, them, he, also, integrated, many, of, syagrius, s, units, into, his, own, army, the, roman, kingdom, was, probably, under, clovis, s, control, by, 491, because, in, the, same, year, clovis, successfully, moved, against, a, small, number, of, thuringians, in, eastern, gaul, near, the, burgundian, border, around, 493, ad, he, secured, an, alliance, with, the, ostrogoths, through, the, marriage, of, his, sister, audofleda, to, their, king, theodoric, the, great, in, the, same, year, the, neighboring, king, of, the, burgundians, was, slain, by, his, brother, gundobad, bringing, civil, strife, to, that, kingdom, allegedly, gundobad, proceeded, to, drown, his, sister, in, law, and, force, his, niece, chrona, into, a, convent, another, niece, clotilde, fled, to, the, court, of, the, third, brother, godegisel, finding, himself, in, a, precarious, position, godegisel, decided, to, ally, himself, to, clovis, by, marrying, his, exiled, niece, to, the, frankish, king, in, 496, the, alamanni, invaded, and, some, salians, and, ripuarians, reguli, kings, defected, to, their, side, clovis, met, his, enemies, near, the, strong, fort, of, tolbiac, during, the, fighting, the, franks, suffered, heavy, losses, clovis, together, with, over, three, thousand, frankish, companions, may, have, converted, to, christianity, around, this, time, with, the, help, of, the, ripuarian, franks, he, narrowly, defeated, the, alamanni, in, the, battle, of, tolbiac, in, 496, now, christian, clovis, confined, his, prisoners, chararic, and, his, son, to, a, monastery, in, 500, or, 501, godegisel, began, scheming, against, his, brother, gundobad, he, promised, his, brother, in, law, territory, and, annual, tribute, for, defeating, his, brother, clovis, was, eager, to, subdue, the, political, threat, to, his, realm, and, crossed, into, the, burgundian, territory, gundobad, then, moved, against, clovis, and, called, his, brother, for, reinforcements, the, three, armies, met, near, dijon, where, both, the, franks, and, godegisel, s, forces, defeated, the, dumbfounded, gundobad, who, escaped, to, avignon, clovis, pursued, him, and, laid, siege, to, the, city, after, some, months, clovis, was, convinced, to, abandon, the, siege, and, settled, for, an, annual, tribute, from, gundobad, in, 501, 502, or, 503, clovis, led, his, troops, to, armorica, he, had, previously, restricted, his, operations, to, minor, raids, but, now, the, goal, was, subjugation, clovis, failed, to, complete, this, objective, via, military, means, therefore, he, was, constrained, to, statecraft, this, proved, fruitful, for, the, armonici, shared, clovis, s, disdain, for, the, arian, visigoths, armorica, and, its, fighters, were, thus, integrated, into, the, frankish, realm, in, 507, clovis, was, allowed, by, the, magnates, of, his, realm, to, invade, the, remaining, threat, of, the, kingdom, of, the, visigoths, king, alaric, had, previously, tried, to, establish, a, cordial, relationship, with, clovis, by, serving, him, the, head, of, exiled, syagrius, on, a, silver, plate, in, 486, or, 487, however, clovis, was, no, longer, able, to, resist, the, temptation, to, move, against, the, visigoths, for, many, nicene, christians, under, visigoth, yoke, were, unhappy, and, implored, clovis, to, make, a, move, but, just, to, be, absolutely, certain, about, retaining, the, loyalties, of, the, nicene, christians, under, visigoths, clovis, ordered, his, troops, to, omit, raiding, and, plunder, for, this, was, not, a, foreign, invasion, but, a, liberation, armorici, assisted, him, in, defeating, the, visigothic, kingdom, of, toulouse, in, the, battle, of, vouill, in, 507, eliminating, visigothic, power, in, gaul, the, battle, added, most, of, aquitaine, to, clovis, s, kingdom, and, resulted, in, the, death, of, the, visigothic, king, alaric, ii, according, to, gregory, of, tours, following, the, battle, the, byzantine, emperor, anastasius, i, made, clovis, a, patrician, and, honorary, consul, following, the, battle, of, vouill, clovis, eliminated, all, his, possible, rivals, including, the, other, frankish, kings, who, ruled, alongside, him, sometime, after, 507, clovis, heard, about, chararic, s, plan, to, escape, from, his, monastic, prison, and, had, him, murdered, around, the, same, time, clovis, convinced, prince, chlodoric, to, murder, his, father, sigobert, earning, him, his, nickname, as, chlodoric, the, parricide, following, the, murder, clovis, betrayed, chlodoric, and, had, his, envoys, strike, him, down, sometime, later, clovis, visited, his, old, ally, ragnachar, in, cambrai, following, his, conversion, to, christianity, in, 508, many, of, clovis, pagan, retainers, had, defected, to, ragnachar, s, side, making, him, a, political, threat, ragnachar, denied, clovis, s, entry, prompting, clovis, to, make, a, move, against, him, he, bribed, ragnachar, s, retainers, and, executed, him, alongside, his, brother, ricchar, shortly, before, his, death, clovis, called, a, synod, of, gallic, bishops, to, meet, in, orl, ans, to, reform, the, church, and, create, a, strong, link, between, the, crown, and, the, nicene, christian, episcopate, this, was, the, first, council, of, orl, ans, thirty, three, bishops, assisted, and, passed, 31, decrees, on, the, duties, and, obligations, of, individuals, the, right, of, sanctuary, and, ecclesiastical, discipline, these, decrees, equally, applicable, to, franks, and, romans, first, established, equality, between, conquerors, and, conquered, after, his, death, clovis, was, laid, to, rest, in, the, abbey, of, st, genevieve, in, paris, his, remains, were, relocated, to, saint, denis, basilica, in, the, mid, to, late, 18th, century, when, clovis, died, his, kingdom, was, partitioned, among, his, four, sons, theuderic, chlodomer, childebert, and, clotaire, this, partition, created, the, new, political, units, of, the, kingdoms, of, rheims, orl, ans, paris, and, soissons, and, inaugurated, a, tradition, that, would, lead, to, disunity, lasting, until, the, end, of, the, merovingian, dynasty, in, 751, clovis, had, been, a, king, with, no, fixed, capital, and, no, central, administration, beyond, his, entourage, by, deciding, to, be, interred, at, paris, clovis, gave, the, city, symbolic, weight, when, his, grandchildren, divided, royal, power, 50, years, after, his, death, in, 511, paris, was, kept, as, a, joint, property, and, a, fixed, symbol, of, the, dynasty, the, disunity, continued, under, the, carolingians, until, after, a, brief, unity, under, charlemagne, the, franks, splintered, into, distinct, spheres, of, cultural, influence, that, coalesced, around, eastern, and, western, centers, of, royal, power, these, later, political, linguistic, and, cultural, entities, became, the, kingdom, of, france, the, myriad, german, states, and, the, semi, autonomous, kingdoms, of, burgundy, and, lotharingia, clovis, was, born, a, pagan, but, later, became, interested, in, converting, to, arian, christianity, whose, followers, believed, that, jesus, was, a, distinct, and, separate, being, from, god, the, father, both, subordinate, to, and, created, by, him, this, contrasted, with, nicene, christianity, whose, followers, believe, that, god, the, father, jesus, and, the, holy, spirit, are, three, persons, of, one, being, consubstantiality, while, the, theology, of, the, arians, was, declared, a, heresy, at, the, first, council, of, nicea, in, 325, the, missionary, work, of, bishop, ulfilas, converted, a, significant, portion, of, the, pagan, goths, to, arian, christianity, in, the, 4th, century, by, the, time, of, the, ascension, of, clovis, gothic, arians, dominated, christian, gaul, and, nicene, christians, were, the, minority, clovis, s, wife, clotilde, a, burgundian, princess, was, a, nicene, christian, despite, the, arianism, that, surrounded, her, at, court, her, persistence, eventually, persuaded, clovis, to, convert, to, nicene, christianity, which, he, initially, resisted, clotilde, had, wanted, her, son, to, be, baptized, but, clovis, refused, so, she, had, the, child, baptized, without, clovis, s, knowledge, shortly, after, his, baptism, their, son, died, which, further, strengthened, clovis, s, resistance, to, conversion, clotilde, also, had, their, second, son, baptized, without, her, husband, s, permission, and, this, son, became, ill, and, nearly, died, after, his, baptism, clovis, eventually, converted, to, nicene, christianity, on, christmas, day, 508, in, a, small, church, in, the, vicinity, of, the, subsequent, abbey, of, saint, remi, in, reims, a, statue, of, his, baptism, by, saint, remigius, can, still, be, seen, there, the, details, of, this, event, have, been, passed, down, by, gregory, of, tours, who, recorded, them, many, years, later, in, the, 6th, century, the, king, s, nicene, baptism, was, of, immense, importance, in, the, subsequent, history, of, western, and, central, europe, in, general, as, clovis, expanded, his, dominion, over, almost, all, of, gaul, nicene, christianity, offered, certain, advantages, to, clovis, as, he, fought, to, distinguish, his, rule, among, many, competing, power, centers, in, western, europe, his, conversion, to, the, nicene, form, of, christianity, served, to, set, him, apart, from, most, other, germanic, kings, of, his, time, such, as, those, of, the, visigoths, and, the, vandals, who, had, converted, from, germanic, paganism, to, arian, christianity, however, he, was, not, the, first, germanic, king, to, convert, to, nicene, christianity, that, distinction, belonging, to, the, suevic, king, of, gallaecia, rechiar, whose, conversion, predates, clovis, s, baptism, by, half, a, century, nevertheless, clovis, s, embrace, of, the, nicene, christian, faith, may, have, also, gained, him, the, support, of, the, nicene, christian, gallo, roman, aristocracy, in, his, later, campaign, against, the, visigoths, which, drove, them, from, southern, gaul, in, 507, and, resulted, in, a, great, many, of, his, people, converting, to, nicene, christianity, as, well, on, the, other, hand, bernard, bachrach, has, argued, that, his, conversion, from, frankish, paganism, alienated, many, of, the, other, frankish, sub, kings, and, weakened, his, military, position, over, the, next, few, years, in, the, interpretatio, romana, saint, gregory, of, tours, gave, the, germanic, gods, that, clovis, abandoned, the, names, of, roughly, equivalent, roman, gods, such, as, jupiter, and, mercury, william, daly, more, directly, assessing, clovis, s, allegedly, barbaric, and, pagan, origins, ignored, the, gregory, of, tours, version, and, based, his, account, on, the, scant, earlier, sources, a, sixth, century, vita, of, saint, genevieve, and, letters, to, or, concerning, clovis, from, bishops, now, in, the, epistolae, austrasicae, and, theodoric, clovis, and, his, wife, were, buried, in, the, abbey, of, st, genevieve, st, pierre, in, paris, the, original, name, of, the, church, was, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, under, clovis, the, first, codification, of, the, salian, frank, law, took, place, the, roman, law, was, written, with, the, assistance, of, gallo, romans, to, reflect, the, salic, legal, tradition, and, christianity, while, containing, much, from, roman, tradition, the, roman, law, lists, various, crimes, as, well, as, the, fines, associated, with, them, the, legacy, of, clovis, s, conquests, a, frankish, kingdom, that, included, most, of, roman, gaul, and, parts, of, western, germany, survived, long, after, his, death, to, many, french, people, he, is, the, founder, of, the, modern, french, state, detracting, perhaps, from, this, legacy, is, his, aforementioned, division, of, the, state, this, was, done, not, along, national, or, even, largely, geographical, lines, but, primarily, to, assure, equal, income, amongst, his, sons, after, his, death, while, it, may, or, may, not, have, been, his, intention, this, division, was, the, cause, of, much, internal, discord, in, gaul, this, precedent, led, in, the, long, run, to, the, fall, of, his, dynasty, for, it, was, a, pattern, repeated, in, future, reigns, clovis, did, bequeath, to, his, heirs, the, support, of, both, people, and, the, church, such, that, when, the, magnates, were, ready, to, do, away, with, the, royal, house, the, sanction, of, the, pope, was, sought, first, in, later, centuries, clovis, was, venerated, as, a, saint, in, france, the, benedictine, abbey, of, saint, denis, where, clovis, was, buried, had, a, shrine, to, st, clovis, to, the, east, of, the, main, altar, 34, there, was, also, a, shrine, to, him, in, the, abbey, of, saint, genevieve, in, paris, 140, this, shrine, had, a, statue, and, a, number, of, epitaphs, and, was, probably, where, the, veneration, of, st, clovis, began, 497, 502, despite, clovis, s, presence, in, paris, his, cultus, was, largely, based, in, the, south, of, france, abbot, aymeric, de, peyrat, d, 1406, the, author, of, the, history, of, the, moissac, abbey, claimed, that, his, own, monastery, was, founded, by, st, clovis, and, there, were, many, monasteries, named, in, his, honour, 130, aymeric, not, only, referred, to, clovis, as, a, saint, but, also, prayed, for, st, clovis, s, intercession, 130, there, were, also, known, to, be, shrines, dedicated, to, clovis, in, glise, sainte, marthe, de, tarascon, and, saint, pierre, du, dor, t, 140, 73, boniface, symoneta, jacques, almain, and, paulus, aemilius, veronensis, gave, hagiographic, accounts, of, clovis, s, life, and, at, the, time, it, was, common, to, include, clovis, s, life, in, collections, of, the, lives, of, the, saints, 73, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, reason, that, the, french, state, promoted, the, veneration, of, clovis, in, the, south, was, to, establish, a, border, cult, that, would, cause, occitans, to, venerate, the, northern, led, french, state, by, venerating, its, founder, 73, another, reason, could, be, that, clovis, was, a, preferable, foundation, figure, for, the, house, of, valois, as, their, predecessors, were, the, direct, capetians, who, looked, back, to, charlemagne, whose, veneration, had, been, widely, recognised, 140, in, contrast, to, the, theory, of, st, clovis, s, cult, being, a, primarily, northern, supported, movement, amy, goodrich, remensnyder, suggests, that, st, clovis, was, used, by, occitans, to, reject, the, northern, concept, of, the, monarchy, and, to, reinstate, their, autonomy, as, something, granted, by, the, saint, 119, 126, st, clovis, had, the, role, of, a, more, militarised, royal, saint, than, the, pious, louis, ix, of, france, 297, as, a, saint, clovis, was, important, as, he, represented, the, spiritual, birth, of, the, nation, and, provided, a, chivalrous, and, ascetic, model, for, french, political, leaders, to, follow, 54, the, veneration, of, st, clovis, was, not, exclusive, to, france, as, a, print, by, the, holy, roman, woodcut, designer, leonhard, beck, made, for, the, habsburg, monarchs, depicts, clovis, as, st, chlodoveus, st, boniface, s, abbey, in, munich, depicted, st, chlodoveus, as, a, saint, worthy, of, emulation, because, of, his, advocacy, 239, and, the, florentine, baroque, painter, carlo, dolci, painted, a, large, depiction, of, st, clovis, for, the, imperial, apartment, in, the, uffizi, gallery, 106, 101, st, clovis, had, no, known, official, canonisation, neither, was, he, beatified, so, his, sainthood, was, only, ever, recognised, by, popular, acclaim, 54, following, the, example, of, the, monks, of, st, genevi, ve, st, clovis, s, feast, day, in, france, was, held, on, 27, november, 497, st, clovis, enjoyed, a, persistent, campaign, from, french, royal, authorities, that, few, non, french, national, or, dynastic, saints, did, 297, french, monarchs, beginning, in, the, 14th, century, at, the, latest, attempted, to, officially, canonise, clovis, a, number, of, times, 59, the, most, notable, attempt, led, by, king, louis, xi, and, modelled, on, the, successful, canonisation, campaign, of, louis, ix, occurred, during, a, conflict, with, the, burgundians, 13, the, cause, for, clovis, s, canonisation, was, taken, up, once, again, in, the, 17th, century, with, jesuit, support, a, vita, and, an, account, of, posthumous, miracles, in, opposition, to, the, controversial, historical, works, of, calvinist, pastor, jean, de, serres, who, portrayed, clovis, as, a, cruel, and, bloodthirsty, king, 53, 54, 59, the, jesuit, attempt, to, formally, canonize, clovis, came, after, a, rediscovery, of, clovis, s, cultus, in, the, 16th, century, during, this, period, the, dual, role, st, clovis, could, have, for, modern, france, was, clarified, as, that, of, a, deeply, sinful, man, who, attained, sainthood, by, submitting, himself, to, the, will, of, god, as, well, as, being, the, founder, of, the, gallican, church, 154, 155, he, also, attained, an, essentially, mystic, reputation, 154, st, clovis, role, in, calling, for, the, first, council, of, orl, ans, was, understood, to, be, strongly, gallican, as, he, called, it, without, papal, authority, and, with, the, understanding, that, he, and, his, bishops, had, the, authority, to, call, councils, that, were, binding, for, the, frankish, people, 157, for, protestant, gallicans, st, clovis, represented, the, role, of, the, monarchy, in, governing, the, church, and, curbing, its, abuses, and, was, contrasted, positively, against, the, papacy, of, his, time, 155, protestants, were, unlikely, to, mention, any, of, the, miracles, attributed, to, st, clovis, sometimes, even, writing, lengthy, rejections, of, their, existence, 158, instead, they, saw, his, sainthood, as, evident, from, his, creation, of, a, state, more, holy, and, christian, than, that, of, rome, 158, catholic, writers, in, the, 16th, century, expanded, upon, the, lists, of, st, clovis, s, attributed, miracles, but, in, the, early, 17th, century, they, also, began, to, minimize, their, use, of, the, miraculous, elements, of, his, hagiography, 164, mid, to, late, 17th, century, jesuit, writers, resisted, this, trend, and, allowed, for, no, doubt, as, to, the, miraculous, nature, of, st, clovis, life, or, his, sainthood, 164, jesuit, writers, stressed, the, more, extreme, elements, of, his, hagiography, and, that, of, other, saints, associated, with, him, even, claiming, that, st, remigius, lived, for, five, hundred, years, 165, these, hagiographies, would, still, be, quoted, and, widely, believed, as, late, as, 1896, the, fourteenth, centenary, of, his, baptism, as, a, speech, from, cardinal, lang, nieux, demonstrates, 167, another, factor, that, led, to, a, resurgence, in, st, clovis, s, veneration, was, the, spanish, monarchy, s, use, of, the, title, catholic, monarchs, a, title, french, monarchs, hoped, to, usurp, by, attributing, it, to, the, much, earlier, figure, of, st, clovis, 162, the, sole, source, for, the, early, frankish, period, is, gregory, of, tours, who, wrote, around, the, year, 590, his, chronology, for, the, reign, of, clovis, is, almost, certainly, fabricated, often, contradicting, itself, and, other, sources, gregory, often, divides, clovis, life, in, spans, of, 5, years, he, became, king, at, age, 15, defeated, syagrius, in, the, 5th, year, of, his, reign, defeated, the, alamanni, in, his, 15th, year, defeated, the, visigoths, in, his, 25th, year, and, died, at, the, age, of, 45, in, the, 5th, year, after, his, victory, at, vouill, having, reigned, 30, years, the, exact, date, on, which, clovis, became, king, of, all, franks, is, not, known, but, it, happened, sometime, after, the, battle, of, vouill, which, is, securely, dated, to, 507, after, this, battle, clovis, made, paris, his, capital, converted, to, catholicism, and, orchestrated, the, murders, of, frankish, kings, sigobert, and, ragnachar, uniting, all, franks, under, his, rule, 38, 43, clovis, baptism, traditionally, dated, to, december, 496, on, the, account, of, gregory, is, now, believed, to, have, taken, place, in, december, 508, the, election, of, paris, as, capital, must, have, also, happened, around, 508, given, that, the, hostilities, between, ragnachar, and, clovis, began, after, his, conversion, it, can, be, inferred, that, their, confrontation, took, place, shortly, after, in, 509, clovis, i, is, traditionally, said, to, have, died, on, 27, november, 511, the, day, is, found, in, one, medieval, calendar, and, two, missals, now, in, the, library, of, the, abbey, of, saint, genevieve, which, was, founded, by, clovis, however, two, obituaries, in, the, abbeys, of, saint, genevieve, and, saint, denis, date, his, death, to, 29, november, and, 3, january, respectively, the, latter, date, may, be, a, confusion, with, the, feast, of, genevieve, which, also, falls, on, 3, january, gregory, of, tours, states, that, clovis, died, on, the, fifth, year, after, the, battle, of, vouill, 43, which, gives, 511, using, inclusive, counting, however, he, also, states, that, he, died, on, the, 11th, year, of, the, episcopate, of, licinius, of, tours, ad, 518, and, on, the, 112th, year, after, the, death, of, martin, of, tours, ad, 508, the, liber, pontificalis, records, that, clovis, crown, was, sent, to, pope, hormisdas, r, 514, 523, which, could, imply, a, later, date, clovis, is, last, attested, in, an, official, document, dated, to, 11, july, 511, on, the, first, council, of, orl, ans, and, it, is, generally, accepted, that, he, died, shortly, after, footnotes, sources
