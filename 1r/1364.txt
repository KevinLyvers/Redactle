of, the, congress, of, the, confederation, marshall, came, to, believe, in, the, necessity, of, a, new, governing, structure, that, would, replace, the, powerless, national, government, established, by, the, articles, of, confederation, he, strongly, favored, ratification, of, the, new, constitution, proposed, by, the, philadelphia, convention, as, it, provided, for, a, much, stronger, federal, government, marshall, was, elected, to, the, 1788, virginia, ratifying, convention, where, he, worked, with, james, madison, to, convince, other, delegates, to, ratify, the, new, constitution, after,

position, instead, choosing, to, focus, on, his, own, law, practice, in, the, early, 1790s, the, federalist, party, and, the, democratic, republican, party, emerged, as, the, country, was, polarized, by, issues, such, as, the, french, revolutionary, wars, and, the, power, of, the, presidency, and, the, federal, government, marshall, aligned, with, the, federalists, and, at, alexander, hamilton, s, request, he, organized, a, federalist, movement, in, virginia, to, counter, the, influence, of, thomas, jefferson, s, democratic, republicans, like, most, other, federalists, marshall, favored, neutrality, in, foreign, affairs, high, tariffs, a, strong, executive, and, a, standing, military, in, 1795, washington, asked, marshall, to, accept, appointment, as, the, united, states, attorney, general, but, marshall, again, declined, the, offer, he, did, however, serve, in, a, variety, of, roles, for, the, state, of, virginia, during, the, 1790s, at, one, point, acting, as, the, state, s, interim, attorney, general, in, 1796, marshall, appeared, before, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, in, ware, v, hylton, a, case, involving, the, validity, of, a, virginia, law, that, provided, for, the, confiscation, of, debts, owed, to, british, subjects, marshall, argued, that, the, law, was, a, legitimate, exercise, of, the, state, s, power, but, the, supreme, court, ruled, against, him, holding, that, the, treaty, of, paris, in, combination, with, the, supremacy, clause, of, the, constitution, required, the, collection, rather, than, confiscation, of, such, debts, according, to, biographer, henry, flanders, marshall, s, argument, in, ware, v, hylton, elicited, great, admiration, at, the, time, of, its, delivery, and, enlarged, the, circle, of, his, reputation, despite, his, defeat, in, the, case, vice, president, john, adams, a, member, of, the, federalist, party, defeated, jefferson, in, the, 1796, presidential, election, and, sought, to, continue, washington, s, policy, of, neutrality, in, the, french, revolutionary, wars, after, adams, took, office, france, refused, to, meet, with, american, envoys, and, began, attacking, american, ships, in, 1797, marshall, accepted, appointment, to, a, three, member, commission, to, france, that, also, included, charles, cotesworth, pinckney, and, elbridge, gerry, the, three, envoys, arrived, in, france, in, october, 1797, but, were, granted, only, a, fifteen, minute, meeting, with, french, foreign, minister, talleyrand, after, that, meeting, the, diplomats, were, met, by, three, of, talleyrand, s, agents, who, refused, to, conduct, diplomatic, negotiations, unless, the, united, states, paid, enormous, bribes, to, talleyrand, and, to, the, republic, of, france, the, americans, refused, to, negotiate, on, such, terms, and, marshall, and, pinckney, eventually, decided, to, return, to, the, united, states, marshall, left, france, in, april, 1798, and, arrived, in, the, united, states, two, months, later, receiving, a, warm, welcome, by, federalist, members, of, congress, during, his, time, in, france, marshall, and, the, other, commissioners, had, sent, secret, correspondence, to, adams, and, secretary, of, state, timothy, pickering, in, april, 1798, congress, passed, a, resolution, demanding, that, the, administration, reveal, the, contents, of, the, correspondence, a, public, outcry, ensued, when, the, adams, administration, revealed, that, talleyrand, s, agents, had, demanded, bribes, the, incident, became, known, as, the, xyz, affair, in, july, 1798, shortly, after, marshall, s, return, congress, imposed, an, embargo, in, france, marking, the, start, of, an, undeclared, naval, war, known, as, the, quasi, war, marshall, supported, most, of, the, measures, congress, adopted, in, the, struggle, against, france, but, he, disapproved, of, the, alien, and, sedition, acts, four, separate, laws, designed, to, suppress, dissent, during, the, quasi, war, marshall, published, a, letter, to, a, local, newspaper, stating, his, belief, that, the, laws, would, likely, create, unnecessarily, discontents, and, jealousies, at, a, time, when, our, very, existence, as, a, nation, may, depend, on, our, union, after, his, return, from, france, marshall, wanted, to, resume, his, private, practice, of, law, but, in, september, 1798, former, president, washington, convinced, him, to, challenge, incumbent, democratic, republican, congressman, john, clopton, of, virginia, s, 13th, congressional, district, although, the, richmond, area, district, favored, the, democratic, republican, party, marshall, won, the, race, in, part, due, to, his, conduct, during, the, xyz, affair, and, in, part, due, to, the, support, of, patrick, henry, during, the, campaign, marshall, declined, appointment, as, an, associate, justice, of, the, supreme, court, and, president, adams, instead, appointed, marshall, s, friend, bushrod, washington, after, winning, the, election, marshall, was, sworn, into, office, when, the, 6th, congress, convened, in, december, 1799, he, quickly, emerged, as, a, leader, of, the, moderate, faction, of, federalists, in, congress, his, most, notable, speech, in, congress, was, related, to, the, case, of, thomas, nash, alias, jonathan, robbins, whom, the, government, had, extradited, to, great, britain, on, charges, of, murder, marshall, defended, the, government, s, actions, arguing, that, nothing, in, the, constitution, prevents, the, united, states, from, extraditing, one, of, its, citizens, his, speech, helped, defeat, a, motion, to, censure, president, adams, for, the, extradition, in, may, 1800, president, adams, nominated, marshall, as, secretary, of, war, but, the, president, quickly, withdrew, that, nomination, and, instead, nominated, marshall, as, secretary, of, state, marshall, was, confirmed, by, the, senate, on, may, 13, and, took, office, on, june, 6, 1800, marshall, s, appointment, as, secretary, of, state, was, preceded, by, a, split, between, adams, and, hamilton, the, latter, of, whom, led, a, faction, of, federalists, who, favored, declaring, war, on, france, adams, fired, secretary, of, state, timothy, pickering, a, hamilton, supporter, after, pickering, tried, to, undermine, peace, negotiations, with, france, adams, directed, marshall, to, bring, an, end, to, the, quasi, war, and, settle, ongoing, disputes, with, britain, spain, and, the, barbary, states, the, position, of, secretary, of, state, also, held, a, wide, array, of, domestic, responsibilities, including, the, deliverance, of, commissions, of, federal, appointments, and, supervision, of, the, construction, of, washington, d, c, in, october, 1800, the, united, states, and, france, agreed, to, the, convention, of, 1800, which, ended, the, quasi, war, and, reestablished, commercial, relations, with, france, with, the, federalists, divided, between, hamilton, and, adams, the, democratic, republicans, emerged, victorious, in, the, presidential, election, of, 1800, however, thomas, jefferson, and, aaron, burr, both, received, 73, electoral, votes, throwing, the, election, to, the, federalist, controlled, house, of, representatives, hamilton, asked, marshall, to, support, jefferson, but, marshall, declined, to, support, either, candidate, in, the, contingent, election, held, to, decide, whether, jefferson, or, burr, would, become, president, each, state, delegation, had, a, single, vote, under, this, rule, it, turned, out, that, neither, party, had, a, majority, because, some, states, had, split, delegations, over, the, course, of, seven, days, february, 11, 17, 1801, the, house, cast, a, total, of, 35, ballots, with, jefferson, receiving, the, votes, of, eight, state, delegations, each, time, one, short, of, the, necessary, majority, of, nine, on, february, 17, on, the, 36th, ballot, jefferson, was, elected, as, president, burr, became, vice, president, had, the, deadlock, lasted, a, couple, weeks, longer, through, march, 4, or, beyond, marshall, as, secretary, of, state, would, have, become, acting, president, until, a, choice, was, made, after, the, election, adams, and, the, lame, duck, congress, passed, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, midnight, judges, act, this, legislation, made, sweeping, changes, to, the, federal, judiciary, including, a, reduction, in, supreme, court, justices, from, six, to, five, upon, the, next, vacancy, in, the, court, so, as, to, deny, jefferson, an, appointment, until, two, vacancies, occurred, in, late, 1800, chief, justice, oliver, ellsworth, resigned, due, to, poor, health, adams, nominated, former, chief, justice, john, jay, to, once, again, lead, the, supreme, court, but, jay, rejected, the, appointment, partly, due, to, his, frustration, at, the, relative, lack, of, power, possessed, by, the, judicial, branch, of, the, federal, government, jay, s, letter, of, rejection, arrived, on, january, 20, 1801, less, than, two, months, before, jefferson, would, take, office, upon, learning, of, jay, s, rejection, marshall, suggested, that, adams, elevate, associate, justice, william, paterson, to, chief, justice, but, adams, rejected, the, suggestion, instead, saying, to, marshall, i, believe, i, must, nominate, you, the, senate, at, first, delayed, confirming, marshall, as, many, senators, hoped, that, adams, would, choose, a, different, individual, to, serve, as, chief, justice, according, to, new, jersey, senator, jonathan, dayton, the, senate, finally, relented, lest, another, not, so, qualified, and, more, disgusting, to, the, bench, should, be, substituted, and, because, it, appeared, that, this, gentleman, was, not, privy, to, his, own, nomination, marshall, was, confirmed, by, the, senate, on, january, 27, 1801, and, took, office, on, february, 4, at, the, request, of, the, president, he, continued, to, serve, as, secretary, of, state, until, adams, term, expired, on, march, 4, consequently, marshall, was, charged, with, delivering, judicial, commissions, to, the, individuals, who, had, been, appointed, to, the, positions, created, by, the, midnight, judges, act, adams, would, later, state, that, my, gift, of, john, marshall, to, the, people, of, the, united, states, was, the, proudest, act, of, my, life, the, marshall, court, convened, for, the, first, time, on, february, 2, 1801, in, the, supreme, court, chamber, of, the, capitol, building, the, court, at, that, time, consisted, of, chief, justice, marshall, and, associate, justices, william, cushing, william, paterson, samuel, chase, bushrod, washington, and, alfred, moore, each, of, whom, had, been, appointed, by, president, washington, or, president, adams, prior, to, 1801, the, supreme, court, had, been, seen, as, a, relatively, insignificant, institution, most, legal, disputes, were, resolved, in, state, rather, than, federal, courts, the, court, had, issued, just, 63, decisions, in, its, first, decades, few, of, which, had, made, a, significant, impact, and, it, had, never, struck, down, a, federal, or, state, law, during, marshall, s, 34, year, tenure, as, chief, justice, the, supreme, court, would, emerge, as, an, important, force, in, the, federal, government, for, the, first, time, and, marshall, himself, played, a, major, role, in, shaping, the, nation, s, understanding, of, constitutional, law, the, marshall, court, would, issue, more, than, 1000, decisions, about, half, of, which, were, written, by, marshall, himself, marshall, s, leadership, of, the, supreme, court, ensured, that, the, federal, government, would, exercise, relatively, strong, powers, despite, the, political, domination, of, the, democratic, republicans, after, 1800, soon, after, becoming, chief, justice, marshall, changed, the, manner, in, which, the, supreme, court, announced, its, decisions, previously, each, justice, would, author, a, separate, opinion, known, as, a, seriatim, opinion, as, was, done, in, the, virginia, supreme, court, of, his, day, and, is, still, done, today, in, the, united, kingdom, and, australia, under, marshall, however, the, supreme, court, adopted, the, practice, of, handing, down, a, single, majority, opinion, of, the, court, allowing, it, to, present, a, clear, rule, the, court, met, in, washington, only, two, months, a, year, from, the, first, monday, in, february, through, the, second, or, third, week, in, march, six, months, of, the, year, the, justices, were, doing, circuit, duty, in, the, various, states, when, the, court, was, in, session, in, washington, the, justices, boarded, together, in, the, same, rooming, house, avoided, outside, socializing, and, discussed, each, case, intently, among, themselves, decisions, were, quickly, made, usually, in, a, matter, of, days, the, justices, did, not, have, clerks, so, they, listened, closely, to, the, oral, arguments, and, decided, among, themselves, what, the, decision, should, be, marshall, s, opinions, were, workmanlike, and, not, especially, eloquent, or, subtle, his, influence, on, learned, men, of, the, law, came, from, the, charismatic, force, of, his, personality, and, his, ability, to, seize, upon, the, key, elements, of, a, case, and, make, highly, persuasive, arguments, as, oliver, wolcott, observed, when, both, he, and, marshall, served, in, the, adams, administration, marshall, had, the, knack, of, putting, his, own, ideas, into, the, minds, of, others, unconsciously, to, them, by, 1811, justices, appointed, by, a, democratic, republican, president, had, a, 5, to, 2, majority, on, the, court, but, marshall, retained, ideological, and, personal, leadership, of, the, court, marshall, regularly, curbed, his, own, viewpoints, preferring, to, arrive, at, decisions, by, consensus, only, once, did, he, find, himself, on, the, losing, side, in, a, constitutional, case, in, that, case, ogden, v, saunders, in, 1827, marshall, set, forth, his, general, principles, of, constitutional, interpretation, to, say, that, the, intention, of, the, instrument, must, prevail, that, this, intention, must, be, collected, from, its, words, that, its, words, are, to, be, understood, in, that, sense, in, which, they, are, generally, used, by, those, for, whom, the, instrument, was, intended, that, its, provisions, are, neither, to, be, restricted, into, insignificance, nor, extended, to, objects, not, comprehended, in, them, nor, contemplated, by, its, framers, is, to, repeat, what, has, been, already, said, more, at, large, and, is, all, that, can, be, necessary, while, marshall, was, attentive, when, listening, to, oral, arguments, and, often, persuaded, other, justices, to, adopt, his, interpretation, of, the, law, he, was, not, widely, read, in, the, law, and, seldom, cited, precedents, after, the, court, came, to, a, decision, he, would, usually, write, it, up, himself, often, he, asked, justice, joseph, story, a, renowned, legal, scholar, and, longtime, friend, of, marshall, to, do, the, chores, of, locating, the, precedents, saying, there, story, that, is, the, law, of, this, case, now, go, and, find, the, authorities, in, his, role, as, secretary, of, state, in, the, adams, administration, marshall, had, failed, to, deliver, commissions, to, 42, federal, justices, of, the, peace, before, the, end, of, adams, s, term, after, coming, to, power, the, jefferson, administration, refused, to, deliver, about, half, of, these, outstanding, commissions, effectively, preventing, those, individuals, from, receiving, their, appointments, even, though, the, senate, had, confirmed, their, nominations, though, the, position, of, justice, of, the, peace, was, a, relatively, powerless, and, low, paying, office, one, individual, whose, commission, was, not, delivered, william, marbury, decided, to, mount, a, legal, challenge, against, the, jefferson, administration, seeking, to, have, his, judicial, commission, delivered, marbury, filed, suit, against, the, sitting, secretary, of, state, james, madison, the, supreme, court, agreed, to, hear, the, case, of, marbury, v, madison, in, its, 1803, term, meanwhile, the, democratic, republicans, passed, the, judiciary, act, of, 1802, which, effectively, repealed, the, midnight, judges, act, and, canceled, the, supreme, court, s, 1802, term, they, also, began, impeachment, proceedings, against, federal, judge, john, pickering, a, prominent, federalist, in, response, federalist, members, of, congress, accused, the, democratic, republicans, of, trying, to, infringe, on, the, independence, of, the, federal, judiciary, in, early, february, 1803, the, supreme, court, held, a, four, day, trial, for, the, case, of, marbury, v, madison, though, the, defendant, james, madison, refused, to, appear, on, february, 24, the, supreme, court, announced, its, decision, which, biographer, joel, richard, paul, describes, as, the, single, most, significant, constitutional, decision, issued, by, any, court, in, american, history, the, court, held, that, madison, was, legally, bound, to, deliver, marbury, s, commission, and, that, marbury, had, the, right, to, sue, madison, yet, the, court, also, held, that, it, could, not, order, madison, to, deliver, the, commission, because, the, judiciary, act, of, 1789, had, unconstitutionally, expanded, the, court, s, original, jurisdiction, to, include, writs, of, mandamus, a, type, of, court, order, that, commands, a, government, official, to, perform, an, act, they, are, legally, required, to, perform, because, that, portion, of, the, judiciary, act, of, 1789, was, unconstitutional, the, court, held, that, it, did, not, have, original, jurisdiction, over, the, case, even, while, simultaneously, holding, that, madison, had, violated, the, law, marbury, v, madison, was, the, first, case, in, which, the, supreme, court, struck, down, a, federal, law, as, unconstitutional, and, it, is, most, significant, for, its, role, in, establishing, the, supreme, court, s, power, of, judicial, review, or, the, power, to, invalidate, laws, as, unconstitutional, as, marshall, put, it, it, is, emphatically, the, province, and, duty, of, the, judicial, department, to, say, what, the, law, is, by, asserting, the, power, of, judicial, review, in, a, holding, that, did, not, require, the, jefferson, administration, to, take, action, the, court, upheld, its, own, powers, without, coming, into, direct, conflict, with, a, hostile, executive, branch, that, likely, would, not, have, complied, with, a, court, order, historians, mostly, agree, that, the, framers, of, the, constitution, did, plan, for, the, supreme, court, to, have, some, sort, of, judicial, review, but, marshall, made, their, goals, operational, though, many, democratic, republicans, expected, a, constitutional, crisis, to, arise, after, the, supreme, court, asserted, its, power, of, judicial, review, the, court, upheld, the, repeal, of, the, midnight, judges, act, in, the, 1803, case, of, stuart, v, laird, in, 1804, the, house, of, representatives, impeached, associate, justice, samuel, chase, alleging, that, he, had, shown, political, bias, in, his, judicial, conduct, many, democratic, republicans, saw, the, impeachment, as, a, way, to, intimidate, federal, judges, many, of, whom, were, members, of, the, federalist, party, as, a, witness, in, the, senate, s, impeachment, trial, marshall, defended, chase, s, actions, in, march, 1805, the, senate, voted, to, acquit, chase, as, several, democratic, republican, senators, joined, with, their, federalist, colleagues, in, refusing, to, remove, chase, the, acquittal, helped, further, establish, the, independence, of, the, federal, judiciary, relations, between, the, supreme, court, and, the, executive, branch, improved, after, 1805, and, several, proposals, to, alter, the, supreme, court, or, strip, it, of, jurisdiction, were, defeated, in, congress, vice, president, aaron, burr, was, not, renominated, by, his, party, in, the, 1804, presidential, election, and, his, term, as, vice, president, ended, in, 1805, after, leaving, office, burr, traveled, to, the, western, united, states, where, he, may, have, entertained, plans, to, establish, an, independent, republic, from, mexican, or, american, territories, in, 1807, burr, was, arrested, and, charged, for, treason, and, marshall, presided, over, the, subsequent, trial, marshall, required, jefferson, to, turn, over, his, correspondence, with, general, james, wilkinson, jefferson, decided, to, release, the, documents, but, argued, that, he, was, not, compelled, to, do, so, under, the, doctrine, of, executive, privilege, during, the, trial, marshall, ruled, that, much, of, the, evidence, that, the, government, had, amassed, against, burr, was, inadmissible, biographer, joel, richard, paul, states, that, marshall, effectively, directed, the, jury, to, acquit, burr, after, burr, was, acquitted, democratic, republicans, including, president, jefferson, attacked, marshall, for, his, role, in, the, trial, in, 1795, the, state, of, georgia, had, sold, much, of, its, western, lands, to, a, speculative, land, company, which, then, resold, much, of, that, land, to, other, speculators, termed, new, yazooists, after, a, public, outcry, over, the, sale, which, was, achieved, through, bribery, georgia, rescinded, the, sale, and, offered, to, refund, the, original, purchase, price, to, the, new, yazooists, many, of, the, new, yazooists, had, paid, far, more, than, the, original, purchase, price, and, they, rejected, georgia, s, revocation, of, the, sale, jefferson, tried, to, arrange, a, compromise, by, having, the, federal, government, purchase, the, land, from, georgia, and, compensate, the, new, yazooists, but, congressman, john, randolph, defeated, the, compensation, bill, the, issue, remained, unresolved, and, a, case, involving, the, land, finally, reached, the, supreme, court, through, the, 1810, case, of, fletcher, v, peck, in, march, 1810, the, court, handed, down, its, unanimous, holding, which, voided, georgia, s, repeal, of, the, purchase, on, the, basis, of, the, constitution, s, contract, clause, the, court, s, ruling, held, that, the, original, sale, of, land, constituted, a, contract, with, the, purchasers, and, the, contract, clause, prohibits, states, from, impairing, the, obligations, of, contracts, fletcher, v, peck, was, the, first, case, in, which, the, supreme, court, ruled, a, state, law, unconstitutional, though, in, 1796, the, court, had, voided, a, state, law, as, conflicting, with, the, combination, of, the, constitution, together, with, a, treaty, in, 1816, congress, established, the, second, bank, of, the, united, states, national, bank, in, order, to, regulate, the, country, s, money, supply, and, provide, loans, to, the, federal, government, and, businesses, the, state, of, maryland, imposed, a, tax, on, the, national, bank, but, james, mcculloch, the, manager, of, the, national, bank, s, branch, in, baltimore, refused, to, pay, the, tax, after, he, was, convicted, by, maryland, s, court, system, mcculloch, appealed, to, the, supreme, court, and, the, court, heard, the, case, of, mcculloch, v, maryland, in, 1819, in, that, case, the, state, of, maryland, challenged, the, constitutionality, of, the, national, bank, and, asserted, that, it, had, the, right, to, tax, the, national, bank, writing, for, the, court, marshall, held, that, congress, had, the, power, to, charter, the, national, bank, he, laid, down, the, basic, theory, of, implied, powers, under, a, written, constitution, intended, as, he, said, to, endure, for, ages, to, come, and, consequently, to, be, adapted, to, the, various, crises, of, human, affairs, marshall, envisaged, a, federal, government, which, although, governed, by, timeless, principles, possessed, the, powers, on, which, the, welfare, of, a, nation, essentially, depends, let, the, end, be, legitimate, marshall, wrote, let, it, be, within, the, scope, of, the, constitution, and, all, means, which, are, appropriate, which, are, plainly, adapted, to, that, end, which, are, not, prohibited, but, consist, with, the, letter, and, the, spirit, of, the, constitution, are, constitutional, the, court, also, held, that, maryland, could, not, tax, the, national, bank, asserting, that, the, power, to, tax, is, equivalent, to, the, power, to, destroy, the, court, s, decision, in, mcculloch, was, according, to, joel, richard, paul, probably, the, most, controversial, decision, handed, down, by, the, marshall, court, southerners, including, virginia, judge, spencer, roane, attacked, the, decision, as, an, overreach, of, federal, power, in, a, subsequent, case, osborn, v, bank, of, the, united, states, the, court, ordered, a, state, official, to, return, seized, funds, to, the, national, bank, the, osborn, case, established, that, the, eleventh, amendment, does, not, grant, state, officials, sovereign, immunity, when, they, resist, a, federal, court, order, congress, established, a, lottery, in, the, district, of, columbia, in, 1812, and, in, 1820, two, individuals, were, convicted, in, virginia, for, violating, a, state, law, that, prohibited, selling, out, of, state, lottery, tickets, the, defendants, philip, and, mendes, cohen, appealed, to, the, supreme, court, the, court, s, subsequent, decision, in, the, 1821, case, of, cohens, v, virginia, established, that, the, supreme, court, could, hear, appeals, from, state, courts, in, criminal, lawsuits, the, court, held, that, because, virginia, had, brought, the, suit, against, the, defendants, the, eleventh, amendment, did, not, prohibit, the, case, from, appearing, in, federal, court, in, 1808, robert, r, livingston, and, robert, fulton, secured, a, monopoly, from, the, state, of, new, york, for, the, navigation, of, steamboats, in, state, waters, fulton, granted, a, license, to, aaron, ogden, and, thomas, gibbons, to, operate, steamboats, in, new, york, but, the, partnership, between, ogden, and, gibbons, collapsed, gibbons, continued, to, operate, steamboats, in, new, york, after, receiving, a, federal, license, to, operate, steamboats, in, the, waters, of, any, state, in, response, ogden, won, a, judgment, in, state, court, that, ordered, gibbons, to, cease, operations, in, the, state, gibbons, appealed, to, the, supreme, court, which, heard, the, case, of, gibbons, v, ogden, in, 1824, representing, gibbons, congressman, daniel, webster, and, attorney, general, william, wirt, acting, in, a, non, governmental, capacity, argued, that, congress, had, the, exclusive, power, to, regulate, commerce, while, ogden, s, attorneys, contended, that, the, constitution, did, not, prohibit, states, from, restricting, navigation, writing, for, the, court, marshall, held, that, navigation, constituted, a, form, of, commerce, and, thus, could, be, regulated, by, congress, because, new, york, s, monopoly, conflicted, with, a, properly, issued, federal, license, the, court, struck, down, the, monopoly, however, marshall, did, not, adopt, webster, s, argument, that, congress, had, the, sole, power, to, regulate, commerce, newspapers, in, both, the, northern, states, and, the, southern, states, hailed, the, decision, as, a, blow, against, monopolies, and, the, restraint, of, trade, marshall, personally, opposed, the, presidential, candidacy, of, andrew, jackson, whom, the, chief, justice, saw, as, a, dangerous, demagogue, and, he, caused, a, minor, incident, during, the, 1828, presidential, campaign, when, he, criticized, jackson, s, attacks, on, president, john, quincy, adams, after, the, death, of, associate, justice, washington, in, 1829, marshall, was, the, last, remaining, original, member, of, the, marshall, court, and, his, influence, declined, as, new, justices, joined, the, court, after, jackson, took, office, in, 1829, he, clashed, with, the, supreme, court, especially, with, regards, to, his, administration, s, policy, of, indian, removal, in, the, 1823, case, of, johnson, v, mcintosh, the, marshall, court, had, established, the, supremacy, of, the, federal, government, in, dealing, with, native, american, tribes, in, the, late, 1820s, the, state, of, georgia, stepped, up, efforts, to, assert, its, control, over, the, cherokee, within, state, borders, with, the, ultimate, goal, of, removing, the, cherokee, from, the, state, after, georgia, passed, a, law, that, voided, cherokee, laws, and, denied, several, rights, to, the, native, americans, former, attorney, general, william, wirt, sought, an, injunction, to, prevent, georgia, from, exercising, sovereignty, over, the, cherokee, the, supreme, court, heard, the, resulting, case, of, cherokee, nation, v, georgia, in, 1831, writing, for, the, court, marshall, held, that, native, american, tribes, constituted, domestic, dependent, nations, a, new, legal, status, but, he, dismissed, the, case, on, the, basis, of, standing, at, roughly, the, same, time, that, the, supreme, court, issued, its, decision, in, cherokee, nation, v, georgia, a, group, of, white, missionaries, living, with, the, cherokee, were, arrested, by, the, state, of, georgia, the, state, did, so, on, the, basis, of, an, 1830, state, law, that, prohibited, white, men, from, living, on, native, american, land, without, a, state, license, among, those, arrested, was, samuel, worcester, who, after, being, convicted, of, violating, the, state, law, challenged, the, constitutionality, of, the, law, in, federal, court, the, arrest, of, the, missionaries, became, a, key, issue, in, the, 1832, presidential, election, and, one, of, the, presidential, candidates, william, wirt, served, as, the, attorney, for, the, missionaries, on, march, 3, 1832, marshall, delivered, the, opinion, of, the, court, in, the, case, of, worcester, v, georgia, the, court, s, holding, overturned, the, conviction, and, the, state, law, holding, that, the, state, of, georgia, had, improperly, exercised, control, over, the, cherokee, it, is, often, reported, that, in, response, to, the, worcester, decision, president, andrew, jackson, declared, john, marshall, has, made, his, decision, now, let, him, enforce, it, more, reputable, sources, recognize, this, as, a, false, quotation, regardless, jackson, refused, to, enforce, the, decision, and, georgia, refused, to, release, the, missionaries, the, situation, was, finally, resolved, when, the, jackson, administration, privately, convinced, governor, wilson, lumpkin, to, pardon, the, missionaries, marshall, established, the, charming, betsy, principle, a, rule, of, statutory, interpretation, in, the, 1804, case, of, murray, v, the, charming, betsy, the, charming, betsy, principle, holds, that, an, act, of, congress, ought, never, to, be, construed, to, violate, the, law, of, nations, if, any, other, possible, construction, remains, in, martin, v, hunter, s, lessee, the, supreme, court, held, that, it, had, the, power, to, hear, appeals, from, state, supreme, courts, when, a, federal, issue, was, involved, marshall, recused, himself, from, the, case, because, it, stemmed, from, a, dispute, over, lord, fairfax, s, former, lands, which, marshall, had, a, financial, interest, in, in, dartmouth, college, v, woodward, the, court, held, that, the, protections, of, the, contract, clause, apply, to, private, corporations, in, ogden, v, saunders, marshall, dissented, in, part, and, assented, in, part, and, the, court, upheld, a, state, law, that, allowed, individuals, to, file, bankruptcy, in, his, separate, opinion, marshall, argued, that, the, state, bankruptcy, law, violated, the, contract, clause, in, barron, v, baltimore, the, court, held, that, the, bill, of, rights, was, intended, to, apply, only, to, the, federal, government, and, not, to, the, states, the, courts, have, since, incorporated, most, of, the, bill, of, rights, with, respect, to, the, states, through, the, fourteenth, amendment, which, was, ratified, decades, after, marshall, s, death, after, his, appointment, to, the, supreme, court, marshall, began, working, on, a, biography, of, george, washington, he, did, so, at, the, request, of, his, close, friend, associate, justice, bushrod, washington, who, had, inherited, the, papers, of, his, uncle, marshall, s, the, life, of, george, washington, the, first, biography, about, a, u, s, president, ever, published, spanned, five, volumes, and, just, under, one, thousand, pages, the, first, two, volumes, published, in, 1804, were, poorly, received, and, seen, by, many, as, an, attack, on, the, democratic, republican, party, nonetheless, historians, have, often, praised, the, accuracy, and, well, reasoned, judgments, of, marshall, s, biography, while, noting, his, frequent, paraphrases, of, published, sources, such, as, william, gordon, s, 1801, history, of, the, revolution, and, the, british, annual, register, after, completing, the, revision, to, his, biography, of, washington, marshall, prepared, an, abridgment, in, 1833, he, wrote, i, have, at, length, completed, an, abridgment, of, the, life, of, washington, for, the, use, of, schools, i, have, endeavored, to, compress, it, as, much, as, possible, after, striking, out, every, thing, which, in, my, judgment, could, be, properly, excluded, the, volume, will, contain, at, least, 400, pages, the, abridgment, was, not, published, until, 1838, three, years, after, marshall, died, in, 1828, marshall, presided, over, a, convention, to, promote, internal, improvements, in, virginia, the, following, year, marshall, was, a, delegate, to, the, state, constitutional, convention, of, 1829, 30, where, he, was, again, joined, by, fellow, american, statesman, and, loyal, virginians, james, madison, and, james, monroe, although, all, were, quite, old, by, that, time, madison, was, 78, monroe, 71, and, marshall, 74, although, proposals, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, tidewater, region, s, slave, owning, aristocrats, compared, to, growing, western, population, proved, controversial, marshall, mainly, spoke, to, promote, the, necessity, of, an, independent, judiciary, in, 1831, the, 76, year, old, chief, justice, traveled, to, philadelphia, pennsylvania, where, he, underwent, an, operation, to, remove, bladder, stones, that, december, his, wife, polly, died, in, richmond, in, early, 1835, marshall, again, traveled, to, philadelphia, for, medical, treatment, where, he, died, on, july, 6, 1835, at, the, age, of, 79, having, served, as, chief, justice, for, over, 34, years, the, liberty, bell, was, rung, following, his, death, a, widespread, story, claims, that, this, was, when, the, bell, cracked, never, to, be, rung, again, unbeknownst, to, marshall, his, eldest, son, thomas, had, died, only, a, few, days, before, killed, by, the, collapse, of, a, chimney, during, a, storm, in, baltimore, through, which, he, was, passing, on, his, way, to, be, at, his, dying, father, s, side, marshall, s, body, was, returned, to, richmond, and, buried, next, to, polly, s, in, shockoe, hill, cemetery, the, inscription, on, his, tombstone, engraved, exactly, as, he, had, wished, reads, as, follows, marshall, was, among, the, last, remaining, founding, fathers, a, group, poetically, called, the, last, of, the, romans, the, last, surviving, cabinet, member, from, the, john, adams, administration, and, the, last, cabinet, member, to, have, served, in, the, 18th, century, in, december, 1835, president, andrew, jackson, nominated, roger, taney, to, fill, the, vacancy, for, chief, justice, over, the, course, of, his, life, marshall, owned, hundreds, of, slaves, during, his, most, influential, period, as, chief, justice, through, the, mid, 1820s, he, wrote, nearly, every, decision, on, slavery, creating, a, jurisprudence, that, was, contemptuous, of, free, blacks, and, favorable, to, violators, of, the, federal, ban, on, the, african, slave, trade, marshall, s, association, with, slavery, began, early, in, 1783, his, father, thomas, marshall, as, a, wedding, present, gave, john, marshall, his, first, slave, robin, spurlock, who, would, remain, marshall, s, manservant, as, well, as, run, his, richmond, household, upon, marshall, s, death, spurlock, would, receive, a, now, seemingly, cruel, choice, of, accepting, manumission, on, the, condition, of, emigrating, to, another, state, or, to, africa, at, age, 78, and, leaving, his, still, enslaved, daughter, agnes, or, choosing, his, master, mistress, from, among, marshall, s, children, early, in, his, career, during, the, 1790s, marshall, represented, slaves, pro, bono, in, a, few, cases, often, trying, to, win, the, freedom, of, mixed, race, individuals, in, possibly, his, most, famous, anti, slavery, case, marshall, represented, robert, pleasants, who, sought, to, carry, out, his, father, s, will, and, emancipate, about, ninety, slaves, marshall, won, the, case, in, the, virginia, high, court, of, chancery, in, an, opinion, written, by, his, teacher, george, wythe, but, that, court, s, holding, was, later, restricted, by, the, virginia, high, court, of, appeals, in, 1796, marshall, also, personally, emancipated, peter, a, black, man, he, had, purchased, furthermore, marshall, in, 1822, signed, an, emancipation, certificate, for, jasper, graham, manumitted, by, the, will, of, john, graham, after, slave, revolts, early, in, the, 19th, century, marshall, expressed, reservations, about, large, scale, emancipation, in, part, because, he, feared, that, a, large, number, of, free, blacks, might, rise, up, in, revolution, moreover, virginia, in, 1806, passed, a, law, requiring, freed, blacks, to, leave, the, state, marshall, instead, favored, sending, free, blacks, to, africa, in, 1817, marshall, joined, the, american, colonization, society, associate, justice, bushrod, washington, being, its, national, president, until, his, death, and, clerk, of, the, supreme, court, elias, caldwell, the, organization, s, long, time, secretary, to, further, that, goal, marshall, purchased, a, life, membership, two, years, later, in, 1823, founded, the, richmond, and, manchester, auxiliary, becoming, that, branch, s, president, and, in, 1834, pledged, 5000, when, the, organization, experienced, financial, problems, in, 1825, as, chief, justice, marshall, wrote, an, opinion, in, the, case, of, the, captured, slave, ship, antelope, in, which, he, acknowledged, that, slavery, was, against, natural, law, but, upheld, the, continued, enslavement, of, approximately, one, third, of, the, ship, s, cargo, although, the, remainder, were, to, be, sent, to, liberia, biographer, and, editor, of, marshall, s, papers, charles, f, hobson, noted, that, multitudes, of, scholars, dating, back, to, albert, beveridge, and, irwin, s, rhodes, understated, the, number, of, slaves, marshall, owned, by, counting, only, his, household, slaves, in, richmond, and, often, ignored, even, the, slaves, at, chickahominy, farm, in, henrico, county, which, marshall, used, as, a, retreat, moreover, marshall, had, received, the, family, s, thousand, acre, oak, hill, plantation, farmed, by, enslaved, labor, in, fauquier, county, from, his, father, when, thomas, marshall, moved, to, kentucky, inherited, it, in, 1802, and, in, 1819, entrusted, its, operation, to, his, son, thomas, marshall, moreover, in, the, mid, 1790s, john, marshall, arranged, to, buy, a, vast, estate, from, lord, fairfax, s, heir, denny, martin, which, led, to, years, of, litigation, in, virginia, and, federal, courts, some, by, his, brother, james, marshall, and, marshall, even, traveled, to, europe, to, secure, financing, in, 1796, eventually, that, led, to, the, supreme, court, s, decision, in, martin, v, hunter, s, lessee, 1816, from, which, chief, justice, marshall, recused, himself, as, an, interested, party, but, which, made, him, wealthy, in, fact, marshall, arranged, with, his, longtime, friend, and, associate, justice, bushrod, washington, to, edit, and, publish, the, late, george, washington, s, papers, in, order, to, re, finance, that, purchase, marshall, s, large, family, came, to, own, many, slaves, even, if, as, hobson, argues, marshall, derived, his, non, judicial, income, not, from, farming, but, by, selling, often, uncultivated, western, lands, research, by, historian, paul, finkelman, revealed, that, marshall, may, have, owned, hundreds, of, slaves, and, engaged, in, the, buying, and, selling, of, slaves, throughout, his, life, although, hobson, believes, finkelman, overstated, marshall, s, involvement, confused, purchases, by, relatives, of, the, same, name, and, noted, the, large, gap, between, marshall, s, documented, slave, purchases, in, the, 1780s, and, 1790s, and, the, 1830s, in, which, marshall, both, drafted, and, modified, his, will, and, sold, slaves, to, pay, debts, of, his, late, son, john, marshall, jr, finkelman, has, repeatedly, suggested, that, marshall, s, substantial, slave, holdings, may, have, influenced, him, to, render, judicial, decisions, in, favor, of, slave, owners, marshall, met, mary, polly, ambler, the, youngest, daughter, of, state, treasurer, jaquelin, ambler, during, the, revolutionary, war, and, soon, began, courting, her, marshall, married, mary, 1767, 1831, on, january, 3, 1783, in, the, home, of, her, cousin, john, ambler, they, had, 10, children, six, of, whom, survived, to, adulthood, between, the, births, of, son, jaquelin, ambler, in, 1787, and, daughter, mary, in, 1795, polly, marshall, suffered, two, miscarriages, and, lost, two, infants, which, affected, her, health, during, the, rest, of, her, life, the, marshalls, had, six, children, who, survived, until, adulthood, thomas, who, would, eventually, serve, in, the, virginia, house, of, delegates, jaquelin, mary, james, and, edward, marshall, loved, his, richmond, home, built, in, 1790, and, spent, as, much, time, there, as, possible, in, quiet, contentment, after, his, father, s, death, in, 1803, marshall, inherited, the, oak, hill, estate, where, he, and, his,
