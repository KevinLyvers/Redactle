amalie, emmy, noether, us, n, t, r, uk, n, t, german, 23, march, 1882, 14, april, 1935, was, a, german, mathematician, who, made, many, important, contributions, to, abstract, algebra, she, proved, noether, s, first, and, second, theorems, which, are, fundamental, in, mathematical, physics, she, was, described, by, pavel, alexandrov, albert, einstein, jean, dieudonn, hermann, weyl, and, norbert, wiener, as, the, most, important, woman, in, the, history, of, mathematics, as, one, of, the, leading, mathematicians, of, her, time, she, developed, theories, of, rings, fields, and, algebras, in, physics, noether, s, theorem, explains, the, connection, between, symmetry, and, conservation, laws, noether, was, born, to, a, jewish, family, in, the, franconian, town, of, erlangen, her, father, was, the, mathematician, max, noether, she, originally, planned, to, teach, french, and, english, after, passing, the, required, examinations, but, instead, studied, mathematics, at, the, university, of, erlangen, where, her, father, lectured, after, completing, her, doctorate, in, 1907, under, the, supervision, of, paul, gordan, she, worked, at, the, mathematical, institute, of, erlangen, without, pay, for, seven, years, at, the, time, women, were, largely, excluded, from, academic, positions, in, 1915, she, was, invited, by, david, hilbert, and, felix, klein, to, join, the, mathematics, department, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, a, world, renowned, center, of, mathematical, research, the, philosophical, faculty, objected, however, and, she, spent, four, years, lecturing, under, hilbert, s, name, her, habilitation, was, approved, in, 1919, allowing, her, to, obtain, the, rank, of, privatdozent, noether, remained, a, leading, member, of, the, g, ttingen, mathematics, department, until, 1933, her, students, were, sometimes, called, the, noether, boys, in, 1924, dutch, mathematician, b, l, van, der, waerden, joined, her, circle, and, soon, became, the, leading, expositor, of, noether, s, ideas, her, work, was, the, foundation, for, the, second, volume, of, his, influential, 1931, textbook, moderne, algebra, by, the, time, of, her, plenary, address, at, the, 1932, international, congress, of, mathematicians, in, z, rich, her, algebraic, acumen, was, recognized, around, the, world, the, following, year, germany, s, nazi, government, dismissed, jews, from, university, positions, and, noether, moved, to, the, united, states, to, take, up, a, position, at, bryn, mawr, college, in, pennsylvania, there, she, taught, graduate, and, post, doctoral, women, including, marie, johanna, weiss, ruth, stauffer, grace, shover, quinn, and, olga, taussky, todd, at, the, same, time, she, lectured, and, performed, research, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, noether, died, on, 14, april, 1935, at, the, age, of, 53, noether, s, mathematical, work, has, been, divided, into, three, epochs, in, the, first, 1908, 1919, she, made, contributions, to, the, theories, of, algebraic, invariants, and, number, fields, her, work, on, differential, invariants, in, the, calculus, of, variations, noether, s, theorem, has, been, called, one, of, the, most, important, mathematical, theorems, ever, proved, in, guiding, the, development, of, modern, physics, in, the, second, epoch, 1920, 1926, she, began, work, that, changed, the, face, of, algebra, in, her, classic, 1921, paper, idealtheorie, in, ringbereichen, theory, of, ideals, in, ring, domains, noether, developed, the, theory, of, ideals, in, commutative, rings, into, a, tool, with, wide, ranging, applications, she, made, elegant, use, of, the, ascending, chain, condition, and, objects, satisfying, it, are, named, noetherian, in, her, honor, in, the, third, epoch, 1927, 1935, she, published, works, on, noncommutative, algebras, and, hypercomplex, numbers, and, united, the, representation, theory, of, groups, with, the, theory, of, modules, and, ideals, in, addition, to, her, own, publications, noether, was, generous, with, her, ideas, and, is, credited, with, several, lines, of, research, published, by, other, mathematicians, even, in, fields, far, removed, from, her, main, work, such, as, algebraic, topology, emmy, noether, was, born, on, 23, march, 1882, she, was, the, first, of, four, children, of, mathematician, max, noether, and, ida, amalia, kaufmann, both, from, jewish, merchant, families, her, first, name, was, amalie, but, she, began, using, her, middle, name, at, a, young, age, and, she, invariably, used, the, name, emmy, noether, in, her, adult, life, and, her, publications, in, her, youth, noether, did, not, stand, out, academically, although, she, was, known, for, being, clever, and, friendly, she, was, near, sighted, and, talked, with, a, minor, lisp, during, her, childhood, a, family, friend, recounted, a, story, years, later, about, young, noether, quickly, solving, a, brain, teaser, at, a, children, s, party, showing, logical, acumen, at, an, early, age, she, was, taught, to, cook, and, clean, as, were, most, girls, of, the, time, and, took, piano, lessons, she, pursued, none, of, these, activities, with, passion, although, she, loved, to, dance, she, had, three, younger, brothers, the, eldest, alfred, noether, was, born, in, 1883, and, was, awarded, a, doctorate, in, chemistry, from, erlangen, in, 1909, but, died, nine, years, later, fritz, noether, was, born, in, 1884, studied, in, munich, and, made, contributions, to, applied, mathematics, he, was, executed, in, the, soviet, union, in, 1941, the, youngest, gustav, robert, noether, was, born, in, 1889, very, little, is, known, about, his, life, he, suffered, from, chronic, illness, and, died, in, 1928, noether, showed, early, proficiency, in, french, and, english, in, the, spring, of, 1900, she, took, the, examination, for, teachers, of, these, languages, and, received, an, overall, score, of, sehr, gut, very, good, her, performance, qualified, her, to, teach, languages, at, schools, reserved, for, girls, but, she, chose, instead, to, continue, her, studies, at, the, university, of, erlangen, at, which, her, father, was, a, professor, this, was, an, unconventional, decision, two, years, earlier, the, academic, senate, of, the, university, had, declared, that, allowing, mixed, sex, education, would, overthrow, all, academic, order, one, of, just, two, women, in, a, university, of, 986, students, noether, was, allowed, only, to, audit, classes, rather, than, participate, fully, and, she, required, the, permission, of, individual, professors, whose, lectures, she, wished, to, attend, despite, these, obstacles, on, 14, july, 1903, she, passed, the, graduation, exam, at, a, realgymnasium, in, nuremberg, during, the, 1903, 1904, winter, semester, she, studied, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, attending, lectures, given, by, astronomer, karl, schwarzschild, and, mathematicians, hermann, minkowski, otto, blumenthal, felix, klein, and, david, hilbert, in, 1903, restrictions, on, women, s, full, enrollment, in, bavarian, universities, were, rescinded, noether, returned, to, erlangen, and, officially, reentered, the, university, in, october, 1904, declaring, her, intention, to, focus, solely, on, mathematics, she, was, one, of, six, women, in, her, year, two, auditors, and, the, only, woman, in, her, chosen, school, under, the, supervision, of, paul, gordan, she, wrote, her, dissertation, ber, die, bildung, des, formensystems, der, tern, ren, biquadratischen, form, on, complete, systems, of, invariants, for, ternary, biquadratic, forms, in, 1907, graduating, summa, cum, laude, later, that, year, gordan, was, a, member, of, the, computational, school, of, invariant, researchers, and, noether, s, thesis, ended, with, a, list, of, over, 300, explicitly, worked, out, invariants, this, approach, to, invariants, was, later, superseded, by, the, more, abstract, and, general, approach, pioneered, by, hilbert, although, it, had, been, well, received, noether, later, described, her, thesis, and, some, subsequent, similar, papers, she, produced, as, crap, from, 1908, to, 1915, noether, taught, at, erlangen, s, mathematical, institute, without, pay, occasionally, substituting, for, her, father, max, noether, when, he, was, too, ill, to, lecture, in, 1910, and, 1911, she, published, an, extension, of, her, thesis, work, from, three, variables, to, n, variables, gordan, retired, in, 1910, and, noether, taught, under, his, successors, erhard, schmidt, and, ernst, fischer, who, took, over, from, the, former, in, 1911, according, to, her, colleague, hermann, weyl, and, her, biographer, auguste, dick, fischer, was, an, important, influence, on, noether, in, particular, by, introducing, her, to, the, work, of, david, hilbert, noether, and, fischer, shared, lively, enjoyment, of, mathematics, and, would, often, discuss, lectures, long, after, they, were, over, noether, is, known, to, have, sent, postcards, to, fischer, continuing, her, train, of, mathematical, thoughts, from, 1913, to, 1916, noether, published, several, papers, extending, and, applying, hilbert, s, methods, to, mathematical, objects, such, as, fields, of, rational, functions, and, the, invariants, of, finite, groups, this, phase, marked, noether, s, first, exposure, to, abstract, algebra, the, field, to, which, she, would, make, groundbreaking, contributions, in, erlangen, noether, advised, two, doctoral, students, hans, falckenberg, and, fritz, seidelmann, who, defended, their, theses, in, 1911, and, 1916, despite, noether, s, significant, role, they, were, both, officially, under, the, supervision, of, her, father, following, the, completion, of, his, doctorate, falckenberg, spent, time, in, braunschweig, and, k, nigsberg, before, becoming, a, professor, at, the, university, of, giessen, while, seidelmann, became, a, professor, in, munich, in, the, spring, of, 1915, noether, was, invited, to, return, to, the, university, of, g, ttingen, by, david, hilbert, and, felix, klein, their, effort, to, recruit, her, was, initially, blocked, by, the, philologists, and, historians, among, the, philosophical, faculty, who, insisted, that, women, should, not, become, privatdozenten, in, a, joint, department, meeting, on, the, matter, one, faculty, member, protested, what, will, our, soldiers, think, when, they, return, to, the, university, and, find, that, they, are, required, to, learn, at, the, feet, of, a, woman, hilbert, who, believed, noether, s, qualifications, were, the, only, important, issue, and, that, the, sex, of, the, candidate, was, irrelevant, objected, with, indignation, and, scolded, those, protesting, her, habilitation, although, his, exact, words, have, not, been, preserved, his, objection, is, often, said, to, have, included, the, remark, that, the, university, was, not, a, bathhouse, according, to, pavel, alexandrov, s, recollection, faculty, members, opposition, to, noether, was, based, not, just, in, sexism, but, also, in, their, objections, to, her, social, democratic, political, beliefs, and, jewish, ancestry, noether, left, for, g, ttingen, in, late, april, two, weeks, later, her, mother, died, suddenly, in, erlangen, she, had, previously, received, medical, care, for, an, eye, condition, but, its, nature, and, impact, on, her, death, is, unknown, at, about, the, same, time, noether, s, father, retired, and, her, brother, joined, the, german, army, to, serve, in, world, war, i, she, returned, to, erlangen, for, several, weeks, mostly, to, care, for, her, aging, father, during, her, first, years, teaching, at, g, ttingen, she, did, not, have, an, official, position, and, was, not, paid, her, lectures, often, were, advertised, under, hilbert, s, name, and, noether, would, provide, assistance, soon, after, arriving, at, g, ttingen, she, demonstrated, her, capabilities, by, proving, the, theorem, now, known, as, noether, s, theorem, which, shows, that, a, conservation, law, is, associated, with, any, differentiable, symmetry, of, a, physical, system, the, paper, invariante, variationsprobleme, was, presented, by, a, colleague, felix, klein, on, 26, july, 1918, at, a, meeting, of, the, royal, society, of, sciences, at, g, ttingen, noether, presumably, did, not, present, it, herself, because, she, was, not, a, member, of, the, society, american, physicists, leon, m, lederman, and, christopher, t, hill, argue, in, their, book, symmetry, and, the, beautiful, universe, that, noether, s, theorem, is, certainly, one, of, the, most, important, mathematical, theorems, ever, proved, in, guiding, the, development, of, modern, physics, possibly, on, a, par, with, the, pythagorean, theorem, when, world, war, i, ended, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, brought, a, significant, change, in, social, attitudes, including, more, rights, for, women, in, 1919, the, university, of, g, ttingen, allowed, noether, to, proceed, with, her, habilitation, eligibility, for, tenure, her, oral, examination, was, held, in, late, may, and, she, successfully, delivered, her, habilitation, lecture, in, june, 1919, noether, became, a, privatdozent, and, she, delivered, that, fall, semester, the, first, lectures, listed, under, her, own, name, she, was, still, not, paid, for, her, work, three, years, later, she, received, a, letter, from, otto, boelitz, the, prussian, minister, for, science, art, and, public, education, in, which, he, conferred, on, her, the, title, of, nicht, beamteter, ausserordentlicher, professor, an, untenured, professor, with, limited, internal, administrative, rights, and, functions, this, was, an, unpaid, extraordinary, professorship, not, the, higher, ordinary, professorship, which, was, a, civil, service, position, although, it, recognized, the, importance, of, her, work, the, position, still, provided, no, salary, noether, was, not, paid, for, her, lectures, until, she, was, appointed, to, the, special, position, of, lehrbeauftragte, f, r, algebra, a, year, later, although, noether, s, theorem, had, a, significant, effect, upon, classical, and, quantum, mechanics, among, mathematicians, she, is, best, remembered, for, her, contributions, to, abstract, algebra, in, his, introduction, to, noether, s, collected, papers, nathan, jacobson, wrote, that, the, development, of, abstract, algebra, which, is, one, of, the, most, distinctive, innovations, of, twentieth, century, mathematics, is, largely, due, to, her, in, published, papers, in, lectures, and, in, personal, influence, on, her, contemporaries, noether, s, work, in, algebra, began, in, 1920, when, in, collaboration, with, her, prot, g, werner, schmeidler, she, published, a, paper, about, the, theory, of, ideals, in, which, they, defined, left, and, right, ideals, in, a, ring, the, following, year, she, published, the, paper, idealtheorie, in, ringbereichen, analyzing, ascending, chain, conditions, with, regards, to, mathematical, ideals, in, which, she, proved, the, lasker, noether, theorem, in, its, full, generality, noted, algebraist, irving, kaplansky, called, this, work, revolutionary, the, publication, gave, rise, to, the, term, noetherian, for, objects, which, satisfy, the, ascending, chain, condition, in, 1924, a, young, dutch, mathematician, bartel, leendert, van, der, waerden, arrived, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, he, immediately, began, working, with, noether, who, provided, invaluable, methods, of, abstract, conceptualization, van, der, waerden, later, said, that, her, originality, was, absolute, beyond, comparison, after, returning, to, amsterdam, he, wrote, moderne, algebra, a, central, two, volume, text, in, the, field, its, second, volume, published, in, 1931, borrowed, heavily, from, noether, s, work, although, noether, did, not, seek, recognition, he, included, as, a, note, in, the, seventh, edition, based, in, part, on, lectures, by, e, artin, and, e, noether, beginning, in, 1927, noether, worked, closely, with, emil, artin, richard, brauer, and, helmut, hasse, on, noncommutative, algebras, van, der, waerden, s, visit, was, part, of, a, convergence, of, mathematicians, from, all, over, the, world, to, g, ttingen, which, had, become, a, major, hub, of, mathematical, and, physical, research, russian, mathematicians, pavel, alexandrov, and, pavel, urysohn, were, the, first, of, several, in, 1923, between, 1926, and, 1930, alexandrov, regularly, lectured, at, the, university, and, he, and, noether, became, good, friends, he, began, referring, to, her, as, der, noether, using, the, masculine, german, article, as, a, term, of, endearment, to, show, his, respect, she, tried, to, arrange, for, him, to, obtain, a, position, at, g, ttingen, as, a, regular, professor, but, was, able, only, to, help, him, secure, a, scholarship, to, princeton, university, for, the, 1927, 1928, academic, year, from, the, rockefeller, foundation, in, g, ttingen, noether, supervised, more, than, a, dozen, doctoral, students, though, most, were, together, with, edmund, landau, and, others, as, she, was, not, allowed, to, supervise, dissertations, on, her, own, her, first, was, grete, hermann, who, defended, her, dissertation, in, february, 1925, although, best, remembered, for, her, work, on, the, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, her, dissertation, was, considered, an, important, contribution, to, ideal, theory, hermann, later, spoke, reverently, of, her, dissertation, mother, around, the, same, time, heinrich, grell, and, rudolf, h, lzer, wrote, their, dissertations, under, n, ether, though, the, latter, died, of, tuberculosis, shortly, before, his, defense, grell, defended, his, thesis, in, 1926, and, went, on, to, work, at, the, university, of, jena, and, the, university, of, halle, before, losing, his, teaching, license, in, 1935, due, to, accusations, of, homosexual, acts, he, was, later, reinstated, and, became, a, professor, at, humboldt, university, in, 1948, noether, then, supervised, werner, weber, and, jakob, levitzki, who, both, defended, their, theses, in, 1929, weber, who, was, considered, only, a, modest, mathematician, would, later, take, part, in, driving, jewish, mathematicians, out, of, g, ttingen, levitzki, worked, first, at, yale, university, and, then, at, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, in, palestine, making, significant, contributions, in, particular, levitzky, s, theorem, and, the, hopkins, levitzki, theorem, to, ring, theory, other, noether, boys, included, max, deuring, hans, fitting, ernst, witt, chiungtze, c, tsen, and, otto, schilling, deuring, who, had, been, considered, the, most, promising, of, noether, s, students, was, awarded, his, doctorate, in, 1930, he, worked, in, hamburg, marden, and, g, ttingen, and, is, known, for, his, contributions, to, arithmetic, geometry, fitting, graduated, in, 1931, with, a, thesis, on, abelian, groups, and, is, remembered, for, his, work, in, group, theory, particularly, fitting, s, theorem, and, the, fitting, lemma, he, died, at, the, age, of, 31, from, a, bone, disease, witt, was, initially, supervised, by, noether, but, her, position, was, revoked, in, april, 1933, and, he, was, assigned, to, gustav, herglotz, instead, he, received, his, phd, in, july, 1933, with, a, thesis, on, the, riemann, roch, theorem, and, zeta, functions, and, went, on, to, make, several, contributions, that, now, bear, his, name, tsen, best, remembered, for, proving, tsen, s, theorem, received, his, doctorate, in, december, of, the, same, year, he, returned, to, china, in, 1935, and, started, teaching, at, national, chekiang, university, but, died, only, five, years, later, schilling, also, began, studying, under, noether, but, was, forced, to, find, a, new, advisor, due, to, noether, s, emigration, under, helmut, hasse, he, completed, his, phd, in, 1934, at, the, university, of, marburg, he, later, worked, as, a, post, doc, at, trinity, college, cambridge, before, moving, to, the, united, states, noether, s, other, students, were, wilhelm, d, rnte, who, received, his, doctorate, in, 1927, with, a, thesis, on, groups, werner, vorbeck, who, did, so, in, 1935, with, a, thesis, on, splitting, fields, and, wolfgang, wichmann, who, did, so, 1936, with, a, thesis, on, p, adic, theory, there, is, no, information, about, the, first, two, but, it, is, known, that, wichmann, supported, a, student, initiative, that, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, revoke, noether, s, dismissal, and, died, as, a, soldier, on, the, eastern, front, during, world, war, ii, noether, developed, a, close, circle, of, mathematicians, beyond, just, her, doctoral, students, who, shared, noether, s, approach, to, abstract, algebra, and, contributed, to, the, field, s, development, a, group, often, referred, to, as, the, noether, school, an, example, of, this, is, her, close, work, with, wolfgang, krull, who, greatly, advanced, commutative, algebra, with, his, hauptidealsatz, and, his, dimension, theory, for, commutative, rings, another, is, gottfried, k, the, who, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, theory, of, hypercomplex, quantities, using, noether, and, krull, s, methods, in, addition, to, her, mathematical, insight, noether, was, respected, for, her, consideration, of, others, although, she, sometimes, acted, rudely, toward, those, who, disagreed, with, her, she, nevertheless, gained, a, reputation, for, constant, helpfulness, and, patient, guidance, of, new, students, her, loyalty, to, mathematical, precision, caused, one, colleague, to, name, her, a, severe, critic, but, she, combined, this, demand, for, accuracy, with, a, nurturing, attitude, in, noether, s, obituary, van, der, waerden, described, her, as, completely, unegotistical, and, free, of, vanity, she, never, claimed, anything, for, herself, but, promoted, the, works, of, her, students, above, all, noether, showed, a, devotion, to, her, subject, and, her, students, that, extended, beyond, the, academic, day, once, when, the, building, was, closed, for, a, state, holiday, she, gathered, the, class, on, the, steps, outside, led, them, through, the, woods, and, lectured, at, a, local, coffee, house, later, after, nazi, germany, dismissed, her, from, teaching, she, invited, students, into, her, home, to, discuss, their, plans, for, the, future, and, mathematical, concepts, noether, s, frugal, lifestyle, at, first, was, due, to, her, being, denied, pay, for, her, work, however, even, after, the, university, began, paying, her, a, small, salary, in, 1923, she, continued, to, live, a, simple, and, modest, life, she, was, paid, more, generously, later, in, her, life, but, saved, half, of, her, salary, to, bequeath, to, her, nephew, gottfried, e, noether, biographers, suggest, that, she, was, mostly, unconcerned, about, appearance, and, manners, focusing, on, her, studies, olga, taussky, todd, a, distinguished, algebraist, taught, by, noether, described, a, luncheon, during, which, noether, wholly, engrossed, in, a, discussion, of, mathematics, gesticulated, wildly, as, she, ate, and, spilled, her, food, constantly, and, wiped, it, off, from, her, dress, completely, unperturbed, appearance, conscious, students, cringed, as, she, retrieved, the, handkerchief, from, her, blouse, and, ignored, the, increasing, disarray, of, her, hair, during, a, lecture, two, female, students, once, approached, her, during, a, break, in, a, two, hour, class, to, express, their, concern, but, they, were, unable, to, break, through, the, energetic, mathematical, discussion, she, was, having, with, other, students, noether, did, not, follow, a, lesson, plan, for, her, lectures, she, spoke, quickly, and, her, lectures, were, considered, difficult, to, follow, by, many, including, carl, ludwig, siegel, and, paul, dubreil, students, who, disliked, her, style, often, felt, alienated, outsiders, who, occasionally, visited, noether, s, lectures, usually, spent, only, half, an, hour, in, the, room, before, leaving, in, frustration, or, confusion, a, regular, student, said, of, one, such, instance, the, enemy, has, been, defeated, he, has, cleared, out, she, used, her, lectures, as, a, spontaneous, discussion, time, with, her, students, to, think, through, and, clarify, important, problems, in, mathematics, some, of, her, most, important, results, were, developed, in, these, lectures, and, the, lecture, notes, of, her, students, formed, the, basis, for, several, important, textbooks, such, as, those, of, van, der, waerden, and, deuring, noether, transmitted, an, infectious, mathematical, enthusiasm, to, her, most, dedicated, students, who, relished, their, lively, conversations, with, her, several, of, her, colleagues, attended, her, lectures, and, she, sometimes, allowed, others, including, her, students, to, receive, credit, for, her, ideas, resulting, in, much, of, her, work, appearing, in, papers, not, under, her, name, noether, was, recorded, as, having, given, at, least, five, semester, long, courses, at, g, ttingen, these, courses, often, preceded, major, publications, on, the, same, subjects, in, the, winter, of, 1928, 1929, noether, accepted, an, invitation, to, moscow, state, university, where, she, continued, working, with, p, s, alexandrov, in, addition, to, carrying, on, with, her, research, she, taught, classes, in, abstract, algebra, and, algebraic, geometry, she, worked, with, the, topologists, lev, pontryagin, and, nikolai, chebotaryov, who, later, praised, her, contributions, to, the, development, of, galois, theory, although, politics, was, not, central, to, her, life, noether, took, a, keen, interest, in, political, matters, and, according, to, alexandrov, showed, considerable, support, for, the, russian, revolution, she, was, especially, happy, to, see, soviet, advances, in, the, fields, of, science, and, mathematics, which, she, considered, indicative, of, new, opportunities, made, possible, by, the, bolshevik, project, this, attitude, caused, her, problems, in, germany, culminating, in, her, eviction, from, a, pension, lodging, building, after, student, leaders, complained, of, living, with, a, marxist, leaning, jewess, hermann, weyl, recalled, that, during, the, wild, times, after, the, revolution, of, 1918, noether, sided, more, or, less, with, the, social, democrats, she, was, from, 1919, through, 1922, a, member, of, the, independent, social, democrats, a, short, lived, splinter, party, in, the, words, of, logician, and, historian, colin, mclarty, she, was, not, a, bolshevist, but, was, not, afraid, to, be, called, one, noether, planned, to, return, to, moscow, an, effort, for, which, she, received, support, from, alexandrov, after, she, left, germany, in, 1933, he, tried, to, help, her, gain, a, chair, at, moscow, state, university, through, the, soviet, education, ministry, although, this, effort, proved, unsuccessful, they, corresponded, frequently, during, the, 1930s, and, in, 1935, she, made, plans, for, a, return, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1932, emmy, noether, and, emil, artin, received, the, ackermann, teubner, memorial, award, for, their, contributions, to, mathematics, the, prize, included, a, monetary, reward, of, 500, and, was, seen, as, a, long, overdue, official, recognition, of, her, considerable, work, in, the, field, nevertheless, her, colleagues, expressed, frustration, at, the, fact, that, she, was, not, elected, to, the, g, ttingen, gesellschaft, der, wissenschaften, academy, of, sciences, and, was, never, promoted, to, the, position, of, ordentlicher, professor, full, professor, noether, s, colleagues, celebrated, her, fiftieth, birthday, in, 1932, in, typical, mathematicians, style, helmut, hasse, dedicated, an, article, to, her, in, the, mathematische, annalen, wherein, he, confirmed, her, suspicion, that, some, aspects, of, noncommutative, algebra, are, simpler, than, those, of, commutative, algebra, by, proving, a, noncommutative, reciprocity, law, this, pleased, her, immensely, he, also, sent, her, a, mathematical, riddle, which, he, called, the, m, riddle, of, syllables, she, solved, it, immediately, but, the, riddle, has, been, lost, in, september, of, the, same, year, noether, delivered, a, plenary, address, gro, er, vortrag, on, hyper, complex, systems, in, their, relations, to, commutative, algebra, and, to, number, theory, at, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, in, z, rich, the, congress, was, attended, by, 800, people, including, noether, s, colleagues, hermann, weyl, edmund, landau, and, wolfgang, krull, there, were, 420, official, participants, and, twenty, one, plenary, addresses, presented, apparently, noether, s, prominent, speaking, position, was, a, recognition, of, the, importance, of, her, contributions, to, mathematics, the, 1932, congress, is, sometimes, described, as, the, high, point, of, her, career, when, adolf, hitler, became, the, german, reichskanzler, in, january, 1933, nazi, activity, around, the, country, increased, dramatically, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, the, german, student, association, led, the, attack, on, the, un, german, spirit, attributed, to, jews, and, was, aided, by, privatdozent, and, noether, s, former, student, werner, weber, antisemitic, attitudes, created, a, climate, hostile, to, jewish, professors, one, young, protester, reportedly, demanded, aryan, students, want, aryan, mathematics, and, not, jewish, mathematics, one, of, the, first, actions, of, hitler, s, administration, was, the, law, for, the, restoration, of, the, professional, civil, service, which, removed, jews, and, politically, suspect, government, employees, including, university, professors, from, their, jobs, unless, they, had, demonstrated, their, loyalty, to, germany, by, serving, in, world, war, i, in, april, 1933, noether, received, a, notice, from, the, prussian, ministry, for, sciences, art, and, public, education, which, read, on, the, basis, of, paragraph, 3, of, the, civil, service, code, of, 7, april, 1933, i, hereby, withdraw, from, you, the, right, to, teach, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, several, of, noether, s, colleagues, including, max, born, and, richard, courant, also, had, their, positions, revoked, noether, accepted, the, decision, calmly, providing, support, for, others, during, this, difficult, time, hermann, weyl, later, wrote, that, emmy, noether, her, courage, her, frankness, her, unconcern, about, her, own, fate, her, conciliatory, spirit, was, in, the, midst, of, all, the, hatred, and, meanness, despair, and, sorrow, surrounding, us, a, moral, solace, typically, noether, remained, focused, on, mathematics, gathering, students, in, her, apartment, to, discuss, class, field, theory, when, one, of, her, students, appeared, in, the, uniform, of, the, nazi, paramilitary, organization, sturmabteilung, sa, she, showed, no, sign, of, agitation, and, reportedly, even, laughed, about, it, later, as, dozens, of, newly, unemployed, professors, began, searching, for, positions, outside, of, germany, their, colleagues, in, the, united, states, sought, to, provide, assistance, and, job, opportunities, for, them, albert, einstein, and, hermann, weyl, were, appointed, by, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, while, others, worked, to, find, a, sponsor, required, for, legal, immigration, noether, was, contacted, by, representatives, of, two, educational, institutions, bryn, mawr, college, in, the, united, states, and, somerville, college, at, the, university, of, oxford, in, england, after, a, series, of, negotiations, with, the, rockefeller, foundation, a, grant, to, bryn, mawr, was, approved, for, noether, and, she, took, a, position, there, starting, in, late, 1933, at, bryn, mawr, noether, met, and, befriended, anna, wheeler, who, had, studied, at, g, ttingen, just, before, noether, arrived, there, another, source, of, support, at, the, college, was, the, bryn, mawr, president, marion, edwards, park, who, enthusiastically, invited, mathematicians, in, the, area, to, see, dr, noether, in, action, during, her, time, at, bryn, mawr, noether, formed, a, group, sometimes, called, the, noether, girls, of, four, post, doctoral, grace, shover, quinn, marie, johanna, weiss, olga, taussky, todd, who, all, went, on, to, have, successful, careers, in, mathematics, and, doctoral, students, ruth, stauffer, they, enthusiastically, worked, through, van, der, waerden, s, moderne, algebra, i, and, parts, of, erich, hecke, s, theorie, der, algebraischen, zahlen, theory, of, algebraic, numbers, stauffer, was, noether, s, only, doctoral, student, in, the, united, states, but, noether, died, shortly, before, she, graduated, she, took, her, examination, with, richard, brauer, and, received, her, degree, in, june, 1935, with, a, thesis, concerning, separable, normal, extensions, after, her, doctorate, stauffer, worked, as, a, teacher, for, a, short, period, and, as, a, statistician, for, over, 30, years, in, 1934, noether, began, lecturing, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, upon, the, invitation, of, abraham, flexner, and, oswald, veblen, she, also, worked, with, abraham, albert, and, harry, vandiver, however, she, remarked, about, princeton, university, that, she, was, not, welcome, at, the, men, s, university, where, nothing, female, is, admitted, her, time, in, the, united, states, was, pleasant, as, she, was, surrounded, by, supportive, colleagues, and, absorbed, in, her, favorite, subjects, in, the, summer, of, 1934, she, briefly, returned, to, germany, to, see, emil, artin, and, her, brother, fritz, the, latter, after, having, been, forced, out, of, his, job, at, the, technische, hochschule, breslau, had, accepted, a, position, at, the, research, institute, for, mathematics, and, mechanics, in, tomsk, in, the, siberian, federal, district, of, russia, he, was, subsequently, executed, during, the, medvedev, forest, massacre, although, many, of, her, former, colleagues, had, been, forced, out, of, the, universities, she, was, able, to, use, the, library, in, g, ttingen, as, a, foreign, scholar, without, incident, noether, returned, to, the, united, states, and, her, studies, at, bryn, mawr, in, april, 1935, doctors, discovered, a, tumor, in, noether, s, pelvis, worried, about, complications, from, surgery, they, ordered, two, days, of, bed, rest, first, during, the, operation, they, discovered, an, ovarian, cyst, the, size, of, a, large, cantaloupe, two, smaller, tumors, in, her, uterus, appeared, to, be, benign, and, were, not, removed, to, avoid, prolonging, surgery, for, three, days, she, appeared, to, convalesce, normally, and, she, recovered, quickly, from, a, circulatory, collapse, on, the, fourth, on, 14, april, noether, fell, unconscious, her, temperature, soared, to, 109, f, 42, 8, c, and, she, died, t, is, not, easy, to, say, what, had, occurred, in, dr, noether, one, of, the, physicians, wrote, it, is, possible, that, there, was, some, form, of, unusual, and, virulent, infection, which, struck, the, base, of, the, brain, where, the, heat, centers, are, supposed, to, be, located, she, was, 53, a, few, days, after, noether, s, death, her, friends, and, associates, at, bryn, mawr, held, a, small, memorial, service, at, college, president, park, s, house, hermann, weyl, and, richard, brauer, both, traveled, from, princeton, and, delivered, eulogies, in, the, months, that, followed, written, tributes, began, to, appear, around, the, globe, albert, einstein, joined, van, der, waerden, weyl, and, pavel, alexandrov, in, paying, their, respects, her, body, was, cremated, and, the, ashes, interred, under, the, walkway, around, the, cloisters, of, the, m, carey, thomas, library, at, bryn, mawr, noether, s, work, in, abstract, algebra, and, topology, was, influential, in, mathematics, while, noether, s, theorem, has, widespread, consequences, for, theoretical, physics, and, dynamical, systems, noether, showed, an, acute, propensity, for, abstract, thought, which, allowed, her, to, approach, problems, of, mathematics, in, fresh, and, original, ways, her, friend, and, colleague, hermann, weyl, described, her, scholarly, output, in, three, epochs, 1, the, period, of, relative, dependence, 1907, 1919, 2, the, investigations, grouped, around, the, general, theory, of, ideals, 1920, 1926, 3, the, study, of, the, non, commutative, algebras, their, representations, by, linear, transformations, and, their, application, to, the, study, of, commutative, number, fields, and, their, arithmetics, in, the, first, epoch, 1907, 1919, noether, dealt, primarily, with, differential, and, algebraic, invariants, beginning, with, her, dissertation, under, paul, gordan, her, mathematical, horizons, broadened, and, her, work, became, more, general, and, abstract, as, she, became, acquainted, with, the, work, of, david, hilbert, through, close, interactions, with, a, successor, to, gordan, ernst, sigismund, fischer, shortly, after, moving, to, g, ttingen, in, 1915, she, proved, the, two, noether, s, theorems, one, of, the, most, important, mathematical, theorems, ever, proved, in, guiding, the, development, of, modern, physics, in, the, second, epoch, 1920, 1926, noether, devoted, herself, to, developing, the, theory, of, mathematical, rings, in, the, third, epoch, 1927, 1935, noether, focused, on, noncommutative, algebra, linear, transformations, and, commutative, number, fields, although, the, results, of, noether, s, first, epoch, were, impressive, and, useful, her, fame, among, mathematicians, rests, more, on, the, groundbreaking, work, she, did, in, her, second, and, third, epochs, as, noted, by, hermann, weyl, and, b, l, van, der, waerden, in, their, obituaries, of, her, in, these, epochs, she, was, not, merely, applying, ideas, and, methods, of, the, earlier, mathematicians, rather, she, was, crafting, new, systems, of, mathematical, definitions, that, would, be, used, by, future, mathematicians, in, particular, she, developed, a, completely, new, theory, of, ideals, in, rings, generalizing, the, earlier, work, of, richard, dedekind, she, is, also, renowned, for, developing, ascending, chain, conditions, a, simple, finiteness, condition, that, yielded, powerful, results, in, her, hands, such, conditions, and, the, theory, of, ideals, enabled, noether, to, generalize, many, older, results, and, to, treat, old, problems, from, a, new, perspective, such, as, elimination, theory, and, the, algebraic, varieties, that, had, been, studied, by, her, father, in, the, century, from, 1832, to, noether, s, death, in, 1935, the, field, of, mathematics, specifically, algebra, underwent, a, profound, revolution, whose, reverberations, are, still, being, felt, mathematicians, of, previous, centuries, had, worked, on, practical, methods, for, solving, specific, types, of, equations, e, g, cubic, quartic, and, quintic, equations, as, well, as, on, the, related, problem, of, constructing, regular, polygons, using, compass, and, straightedge, beginning, with, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, 1832, proof, that, prime, numbers, such, as, five, can, be, factored, in, gaussian, integers, variste, galois, s, introduction, of, permutation, groups, in, 1832, although, because, of, his, death, his, papers, were, published, only, in, 1846, by, liouville, william, rowan, hamilton, s, description, of, quaternions, in, 1843, and, arthur, cayley, s, more, modern, definition, of, groups, in, 1854, research, turned, to, determining, the, properties, of, ever, more, abstract, systems, defined, by, ever, more, universal, rules, noether, s, most, important, contributions, to, mathematics, were, to, the, development, of, this, new, field, abstract, algebra, two, of, the, most, basic, objects, in, abstract, algebra, are, groups, and, rings, a, group, consists, of, a, set, of, elements, and, a, single, operation, which, combines, a, first, and, a, second, element, and, returns, a, third, the, operation, must, satisfy, certain, constraints, for, it, to, determine, a, group, it, must, be, closed, when, applied, to, any, pair, of, elements, of, the, associated, set, the, generated, element, must, also, be, a, member, of, that, set, it, must, be, associative, there, must, be, an, identity, element, an, element, which, when, combined, with, another, element, using, the, operation, results, in, the, original, element, such, as, by, multiplying, a, number, by, one, and, for, every, element, there, must, be, an, inverse, element, a, ring, likewise, has, a, set, of, elements, but, now, has, two, operations, the, first, operation, must, make, the, set, a, commutative, group, and, the, second, operation, is, associative, and, distributive, with, respect, to, the, first, operation, it, may, or, may, not, be, commutative, this, means, that, the, result, of, applying, the, operation, to, a, first, and, a, second, element, is, the, same, as, to, the, second, and, first, the, order, of, the, elements, does, not, matter, if, every, non, zero, element, has, a, multiplicative, inverse, an, element, x, such, that, ax, xa, 1, the, ring, is, called, a, division, ring, a, field, is, defined, as, a, commutative, division, ring, for, instance, the, integers, form, a, commutative, ring, whose, elements, are, the, integers, and, the, combining, operations, are, addition, and, multiplication, any, pair, of, integers, can, be, added, or, multiplied, always, resulting, in, another, integer, and, the, first, operation, addition, is, commutative, i, e, for, any, elements, a, and, b, in, the, ring, a, b, b, a, the, second, operation, multiplication, also, is, commutative, but, that, need, not, be, true, for, other, rings, meaning, that, a, combined, with, b, might, be, different, from, b, combined, with, a, examples, of, noncommutative, rings, include, matrices, and, quaternions, the, integers, do, not, form, a, division, ring, because, the, second, operation, cannot, always, be, inverted, for, example, there, is, no, integer, a, such, that, 3, a, 1, the, integers, have, additional, properties, which, do, not, generalize, to, all, commutative, rings, an, important, example, is, the, fundamental, theorem, of, arithmetic, which, says, that, every, positive, integer, can, be, factored, uniquely, into, prime, numbers, unique, factorizations, do, not, always, exist, in, other, rings, but, noether, found, a, unique, factorization, theorem, now, called, the, lasker, noether, theorem, for, the, ideals, of, many, rings, much, of, noether, s, work, lay, in, determining, what, properties, do, hold, for, all, rings, in, devising, novel, analogs, of, the, old, integer, theorems, and, in, determining, the, minimal, set, of, assumptions, required, to, yield, certain, properties, of, rings, groups, are, frequently, studied, through, group, representations, in, their, most, general, form, these, consist, of, a, choice, of, group, a, set, and, an, action, of, the, group, on, the, set, that, is, an, operation, which, takes, an, element, of, the, group, and, an, element, of, the, set, and, returns, an, element, of, the, set, most, often, the, set, is, a, vector, space, and, the, group, describes, the, symmetries, of, the, vector, space, for, example, there, is, a, group, which, represents, the, rigid, rotations, of, space, rotations, are, a, type, of, symmetry, of, space, because, the, laws, of, physics, themselves, do, not, pick, out, a, preferred, direction, noether, used, these, sorts, of, symmetries, in, her, work, on, invariants, in, physics, a, powerful, way, of, studying, rings, is, through, their, modules, a, module, consists, of, a, choice, of, ring, another, set, usually, distinct, from, the, underlying, set, of, the, ring, and, called, the, underlying, set, of, the, module, an, operation, on, pairs, of, elements, of, the, underlying, set, of, the, module, and, an, operation, which, takes, an, element, of, the, ring, and, an, element, of, the, module, and, returns, an, element, of, the, module, the, underlying, set, of, the, module, and, its, operation, must, form, a, group, a, module, is, a, ring, theoretic, version, of, a, group, representation, ignoring, the, second, ring, operation, and, the, operation, on, pairs, of, module, elements, determines, a, group, representation, the, real, utility, of, modules, is, that, the, kinds, of, modules, that, exist, and, their, interactions, reveal, the, structure, of, the, ring, in, ways, that, are, not, apparent, from, the, ring, itself, an, important, special, case, of, this, is, an, algebra, an, algebra, consists, of, a, choice, of, two, rings, and, an, operation, which, takes, an, element, from, each, ring, and, returns, an, element, of, the, second, ring, this, operation, makes, the, second, ring, into, a, module, over, the, first, often, the, first, ring, is, a, field, words, such, as, element, and, combining, operation, are, very, general, and, can, be, applied, to, many, real, world, and, abstract, situations, any, set, of, things, that, obeys, all, the, rules, for, one, or, two, operation, s, is, by, definition, a, group, or, ring, and, obeys, all, theorems, about, groups, or, rings, integer, numbers, and, the, operations, of, addition, and, multiplication, are, just, one, example, for, instance, the, elements, might, be, logical, propositions, where, the, first, combining, operation, is, exclusive, or, and, the, second, is, logical, conjunction, theorems, of, abstract, algebra, are, powerful, because, they, are, general, they, govern, many, systems, it, might, be, imagined, that, little, could, be, concluded, about, objects, defined, with, so, few, properties, but, precisely, therein, lay, noether, s, gift, to, discover, the, maximum, that, could, be, concluded, from, a, given, set, of, properties, or, conversely, to, identify, the, minimum, set, the, essential, properties, responsible, for, a, particular, observation, unlike, most, mathematicians, she, did, not, make, abstractions, by, generalizing, from, known, examples, rather, she, worked, directly, with, the, abstractions, in, his, obituary, of, noether, van, der, waerden, recalled, that, the, maxim, by, which, emmy, noether, was, guided, throughout, her, work, might, be, formulated, as, follows, any, relationships, between, numbers, functions, and, operations, become, transparent, generally, applicable, and, fully, productive, only, after, they, have, been, isolated, from, their, particular, objects, and, been, formulated, as, universally, valid, concepts, this, is, the, begriffliche, mathematik, purely, conceptual, mathematics, that, was, characteristic, of, noether, this, style, of, mathematics, was, consequently, adopted, by, other, mathematicians, especially, in, the, then, new, field, of, abstract, algebra, much, of, noether, s, work, in, the, first, epoch, of, her, career, was, associated, with, invariant, theory, principally, algebraic, invariant, theory, invariant, theory, is, concerned, with, expressions, that, remain, constant, invariant, under, a, group, of, transformations, as, an, everyday, example, if, a, rigid, yardstick, is, rotated, the, coordinates, x, 1, y, 1, z, 1, and, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, of, its, endpoints, change, but, its, length, l, given, by, the, formula, l, 2, x, 2, y, 2, z, 2, remains, the, same, invariant, theory, was, an, active, area, of, research, in, the, later, nineteenth, century, prompted, in, part, by, felix, klein, s, erlangen, program, according, to, which, different, types, of, geometry, should, be, characterized, by, their, invariants, under, transformations, e, g, the, cross, ratio, of, projective, geometry, an, example, of, an, invariant, is, the, discriminant, b, 2, 4, ac, of, a, binary, quadratic, form, x, a, x, y, b, x, y, c, y, where, x, and, y, are, vectors, and, is, the, dot, product, or, inner, product, for, the, vectors, a, b, and, c, are, linear, operators, on, the, vectors, typically, matrices, the, discriminant, is, called, invariant, because, it, is, not, changed, by, linear, substitutions, x, a, x, b, y, and, y, c, x, d, y, with, determinant, ad, bc, 1, these, substitutions, form, the, special, linear, group, sl, 2, one, can, ask, for, all, polynomials, in, a, b, and, c, that, are, unchanged, by, the, action, of, sl, 2, these, are, called, the, invariants, of, binary, quadratic, forms, and, turn, out, to, be, the, polynomials, in, the, discriminant, more, generally, one, can, ask, for, the, invariants, of, homogeneous, polynomials, a, 0, x, r, y, 0, a, r, x, 0, y, r, of, higher, degree, which, will, be, certain, polynomials, in, the, coefficients, a, 0, a, r, and, more, generally, still, one, can, ask, the, similar, question, for, homogeneous, polynomials, in, more, than, two, variables, one, of, the, main, goals, of, invariant, theory, was, to, solve, the, finite, basis, problem, the, sum, or, product, of, any, two, invariants, is, invariant, and, the, finite, basis, problem, asked, whether, it, was, possible, to, get, all, the, invariants, by, starting, with, a, finite, list, of, invariants, called, generators, and, then, adding, or, multiplying, the, generators, together, for, example, the, discriminant, gives, a, finite, basis, with, one, element, for, the, invariants, of, binary, quadratic, forms, noether, s, advisor, paul, gordan, was, known, as, the, king, of, invariant, theory, and, his, chief, contribution, to, mathematics, was, his, 1870, solution, of, the, finite, basis, problem, for, invariants, of, homogeneous, polynomials, in, two, variables, he, proved, this, by, giving, a, constructive, method, for, finding, all, of, the, invariants, and, their, generators, but, was, not, able, to, carry, out, this, constructive, approach, for, invariants, in, three, or, more, variables, in, 1890, david, hilbert, proved, a, similar, statement, for, the, invariants, of, homogeneous, polynomials, in, any, number, of, variables, furthermore, his, method, worked, not, only, for, the, special, linear, group, but, also, for, some, of, its, subgroups, such, as, the, special, orthogonal, group, galois, theory, concerns, transformations, of, number, fields, that, permute, the, roots, of, an, equation, consider, a, polynomial, equation, of, a, variable, x, of, degree, n, in, which, the, coefficients, are, drawn, from, some, ground, field, which, might, be, for, example, the, field, of, real, numbers, rational, numbers, or, the, integers, modulo, 7, there, may, or, may, not, be, choices, of, x, which, make, this, polynomial, evaluate, to, zero, such, choices, if, they, exist, are, called, roots, for, example, if, the, polynomial, is, x, 2, 1, and, the, field, is, the, real, numbers, then, the, polynomial, has, no, roots, because, any, choice, of, x, makes, the, polynomial, greater, than, or, equal, to, one, if, the, field, is, extended, however, then, the, polynomial, may, gain, roots, and, if, it, is, extended, enough, then, it, always, has, a, number, of, roots, equal, to, its, degree, continuing, the, previous, example, if, the, field, is, enlarged, to, the, complex, numbers, then, the, polynomial, gains, two, roots, i, and, i, where, i, is, the, imaginary, unit, that, is, i, 2, 1, more, generally, the, extension, field, in, which, a, polynomial, can, be, factored, into, its, roots, is, known, as, the, splitting, field, of, the, polynomial, the, galois, group, of, a, polynomial, is, the, set, of, all, transformations, of, the, splitting, field, which, preserve, the, ground, field, and, the, roots, of, the, polynomial, these, transformations, are, called, automorphisms, the, galois, group, of, x, 2, 1, consists, of, two, elements, the, identity, transformation, which, sends, every, complex, number, to, itself, and, complex, conjugation, which, sends, i, to, i, since, the, galois, group, does, not, change, the, ground, field, it, leaves, the, coefficients, of, the, polynomial, unchanged, so, it, must, leave, the, set, of, all, roots, unchanged, each, root, can, move, to, another, root, however, so, transformation, determines, a, permutation, of, the, n, roots, among, themselves, the, significance, of, the, galois, group, derives, from, the, fundamental, theorem, of, galois, theory, which, proves, that, the, fields, lying, between, the, ground, field, and, the, splitting, field, are, in, one, to, one, correspondence, with, the, subgroups, of, the, galois, group, in, 1918, noether, published, a, paper, on, the, inverse, galois, problem, instead, of, determining, the, galois, group, of, transformations, of, a, given, field, and, its, extension, noether, asked, whether, given, a, field, and, a, group, it, always, is, possible, to, find, an, extension, of, the, field, that, has, the, given, group, as, its, galois, group, she, reduced, this, to, noether, s, problem, which, asks, whether, the, fixed, field, of, a, subgroup, g, of, the, permutation, group, s, n, acting, on, the, field, k, x, 1, x, n, always, is, a, pure, transcendental, extension, of, the, field, k, she, first, mentioned, this, problem, in, a, 1913, paper, where, she, attributed, the, problem, to, her, colleague, fischer, she, showed, this, was, true, for, n, 2, 3, or, 4, in, 1969, richard, swan, found, a, counter, example, to, noether, s, problem, with, n, 47, and, g, a, cyclic, group, of, order, 47, although, this, group, can, be, realized, as, a, galois, group, over, the, rationals, in, other, ways, the, inverse, galois, problem, remains, unsolved, noether, was, brought, to, g, ttingen, in, 1915, by, david, hilbert, and, felix, klein, who, wanted, her, expertise, in, invariant, theory, to, help, them, in, understanding, general, relativity, a, geometrical, theory, of, gravitation, developed, mainly, by, albert, einstein, hilbert, had, observed, that, the, conservation, of, energy, seemed, to, be, violated, in, general, relativity, because, gravitational, energy, could, itself, gravitate, noether, provided, the, resolution, of, this, paradox, and, a, fundamental, tool, of, modern, theoretical, physics, with, noether, s, first, theorem, which, she, proved, in, 1915, but, did, not, publish, until, 1918, she, not, only, solved, the, problem, for, general, relativity, but, also, determined, the, conserved, quantities, for, every, system, of, physical, laws, that, possesses, some, continuous, symmetry, upon, receiving, her, work, einstein, wrote, to, hilbert, yesterday, i, received, from, miss, noether, a, very, interesting, paper, on, invariants, i, m, impressed, that, such, things, can, be, understood, in, such, a, general, way, the, old, guard, at, g, ttingen, should, take, some, lessons, from, miss, noether, she, seems, to, know, her, stuff, for, illustration, if, a, physical, system, behaves, the, same, regardless, of, how, it, is, oriented, in, space, the, physical, laws, that, govern, it, are, rotationally, symmetric, from, this, symmetry, noether, s, theorem, shows, the, angular, momentum, of, the, system, must, be, conserved, the, physical, system, itself, need, not, be, symmetric, a, jagged, asteroid, tumbling, in, space, conserves, angular, momentum, despite, its, asymmetry, rather, the, symmetry, of, the, physical, laws, governing, the, system, is, responsible, for, the, conservation, law, as, another, example, if, a, physical, experiment, has, the, same, outcome, at, any, place, and, at, any, time, then, its, laws, are, symmetric, under, continuous, translations, in, space, and, time, by, noether, s, theorem, these, symmetries, account, for, the, conservation, laws, of, linear, momentum, and, energy, within, this, system, respectively, noether, s, theorem, has, become, a, fundamental, tool, of, modern, theoretical, physics, both, because, of, the, insight, it, gives, into, conservation, laws, and, also, as, a, practical, calculation, tool, her, theorem, allows, researchers, to, determine, the, conserved, quantities, from, the, observed, symmetries, of, a, physical, system, conversely, it, facilitates, the, description, of, a, physical, system, based, on, classes, of, hypothetical, physical, laws, for, illustration, suppose, that, a, new, physical, phenomenon, is, discovered, noether, s, theorem, provides, a, test, for, theoretical, models, of, the, phenomenon, if, the, theory, has, a, continuous, symmetry, then, noether, s, theorem, guarantees, that, the, theory, has, a, conserved, quantity, and, for, the, theory, to, be, correct, this, conservation, must, be, observable, in, experiments, in, this, epoch, noether, became, famous, for, her, deft, use, of, ascending, teilerkettensatz, or, descending, vielfachenkettensatz, chain, conditions, a, sequence, of, non, empty, subsets, a, 1, a, 2, a, 3, etc, of, a, set, s, is, usually, said, to, be, ascending, if, each, is, a, subset, of, the, next, conversely, a, sequence, of, subsets, of, s, is, called, descending, if, each, contains, the, next, subset, a, chain, becomes, constant, after, a, finite, number, of, steps, if, there, is, an, n, such, that, a, n, a, m, displaystyle, a, n, a, m, for, all, m, n, a, collection, of, subsets, of, a, given, set, satisfies, the, ascending, chain, condition, if, any, ascending, sequence, becomes, constant, after, a, finite, number, of, steps, it, satisfies, the, descending, chain, condition, if, any, descending, sequence, becomes, constant, after, a, finite, number, of, steps, ascending, and, descending, chain, conditions, are, general, meaning, that, they, can, be, applied, to, many, types, of, mathematical, objects, and, on, the, surface, they, might, not, seem, very, powerful, noether, showed, how, to, exploit, such, conditions, however, to, maximum, advantage, for, example, chain, conditions, can, be, used, to, show, that, every, set, of, sub, objects, has, a, maximal, minimal, element, or, that, a, complex, object, can, be, generated, by, a, smaller, number, of, elements, these, conclusions, often, are, crucial, steps, in, a, proof, many, types, of, objects, in, abstract, algebra, can, satisfy, chain, conditions, and, usually, if, they, satisfy, an, ascending, chain, condition, they, are, called, noetherian, in, her, honor, by, definition, a, noetherian, ring, satisfies, an, ascending, chain, condition, on, its, left, and, right, ideals, whereas, a, noetherian, group, is, defined, as, a, group, in, which, every, strictly, ascending, chain, of, subgroups, is, finite, a, noetherian, module, is, a, module, in, which, every, strictly, ascending, chain, of, submodules, becomes, constant, after, a, finite, number, of, steps, a, noetherian, space, is, a, topological, space, in, which, every, strictly, ascending, chain, of, open, subspaces, becomes, constant, after, a, finite, number, of, steps, this, definition, makes, the, spectrum, of, a, noetherian, ring, a, noetherian, topological, space, the, chain, condition, often, is, inherited, by, sub, objects, for, example, all, subspaces, of, a, noetherian, space, are, noetherian, themselves, all, subgroups, and, quotient, groups, of, a, noetherian, group, are, likewise, noetherian, and, mutatis, mutandis, the, same, holds, for, submodules, and, quotient, modules, of, a, noetherian, module, all, quotient, rings, of, a, noetherian, ring, are, noetherian, but, that, does, not, necessarily, hold, for, its, subrings, the, chain, condition, also, may, be, inherited, by, combinations, or, extensions, of, a, noetherian, object, for, example, finite, direct, sums, of, noetherian, rings, are, noetherian, as, is, the, ring, of, formal, power, series, over, a, noetherian, ring, another, application, of, such, chain, conditions, is, in, noetherian, induction, also, known, as, well, founded, induction, which, is, a, generalization, of, mathematical, induction, it, frequently, is, used, to, reduce, general, statements, about, collections, of, objects, to, statements, about, specific, objects, in, that, collection, suppose, that, s, is, a, partially, ordered, set, one, way, of, proving, a, statement, about, the, objects, of, s, is, to, assume, the, existence, of, a, counterexample, and, deduce, a, contradiction, thereby, proving, the, contrapositive, of, the, original, statement, the, basic, premise, of, noetherian, induction, is, that, every, non, empty, subset, of, s, contains, a, minimal, element, in, particular, the, set, of, all, counterexamples, contains, a, minimal, element, the, minimal, counterexample, in, order, to, prove, the, original, statement, therefore, it, suffices, to, prove, something, seemingly, much, weaker, for, any, counter, example, there, is, a, smaller, counter, example, noether, s, paper, idealtheorie, in, ringbereichen, theory, of, ideals, in, ring, domains, 1921, is, the, foundation, of, general, commutative, ring, theory, and, gives, one, of, the, first, general, definitions, of, a, commutative, ring, before, her, paper, most, results, in, commutative, algebra, were, restricted, to, special, examples, of, commutative, rings, such, as, polynomial, rings, over, fields, or, rings, of, algebraic, integers, noether, proved, that, in, a, ring, which, satisfies, the, ascending, chain, condition, on, ideals, every, ideal, is, finitely, generated, in, 1943, french, mathematician, claude, chevalley, coined, the, term, noetherian, ring, to, describe, this, property, a, major, result, in, noether, s, 1921, paper, is, the, lasker, noether, theorem, which, extends, lasker, s, theorem, on, the, primary, decomposition, of, ideals, of, polynomial, rings, to, all, noetherian, rings, the, lasker, noether, theorem, can, be, viewed, as, a, generalization, of, the, fundamental, theorem, of, arithmetic, which, states, that, any, positive, integer, can, be, expressed, as, a, product, of, prime, numbers, and, that, this, decomposition, is, unique, noether, s, work, abstrakter, aufbau, der, idealtheorie, in, algebraischen, zahl, und, funktionenk, rpern, abstract, structure, of, the, theory, of, ideals, in, algebraic, number, and, function, fields, 1927, characterized, the, rings, in, which, the, ideals, have, unique, factorization, into, prime, ideals, as, the, dedekind, domains, integral, domains, that, are, noetherian, 0, or, 1, dimensional, and, integrally, closed, in, their, quotient, fields, this, paper, also, contains, what, now, are, called, the, isomorphism, theorems, which, describe, some, fundamental, natural, isomorphisms, and, some, other, basic, results, on, noetherian, and, artinian, modules, in, 1923, 1924, noether, applied, her, ideal, theory, to, elimination, theory, in, a, formulation, that, she, attributed, to, her, student, kurt, hentzelt, she, showed, that, fundamental, theorems, about, the, factorization, of, polynomials, could, be, carried, over, directly, traditionally, elimination, theory, is, concerned, with, eliminating, one, or, more, variables, from, a, system, of, polynomial, equations, usually, by, the, method, of, resultants, for, illustration, a, system, of, equations, often, can, be, written, in, the, form, where, a, matrix, or, linear, transform, m, without, the, variable, x, times, a, vector, v, that, only, has, non, zero, powers, of, x, is, equal, to, the, zero, vector, 0, hence, the, determinant, of, the, matrix, m, must, be, zero, providing, a, new, equation, in, which, the, variable, x, has, been, eliminated, techniques, such, as, hilbert, s, original, non, constructive, solution, to, the, finite, basis, problem, could, not, be, used, to, get, quantitative, information, about, the, invariants, of, a, group, action, and, furthermore, they, did, not, apply, to, all, group, actions, in, her, 1915, paper, noether, found, a, solution, to, the, finite, basis, problem, for, a, finite, group, of, transformations, g, acting, on, a, finite, dimensional, vector, space, over, a, field, of, characteristic, zero, her, solution, shows, that, the, ring, of, invariants, is, generated, by, homogeneous, invariants, whose, degree, is, less, than, or, equal, to, the, order, of, the, finite, group, this, is, called, noether, s, bound, her, paper, gave, two, proofs, of, noether, s, bound, both, of, which, also, work, when, the, characteristic, of, the, field, is, coprime, to, g, displaystyle, left, g, right, the, factorial, of, the, order, g, displaystyle, left, g, right, of, the, group, g, the, degrees, of, generators, need, not, satisfy, noether, s, bound, when, the, characteristic, of, the, field, divides, the, number, g, displaystyle, left, g, right, but, noether, was, not, able, to, determine, whether, this, bound, was, correct, when, the, characteristic, of, the, field, divides, g, displaystyle, left, g, right, but, not, g, displaystyle, left, g, right, for, many, years, determining, the, truth, or, falsehood, of, this, bound, for, this, particular, case, was, an, open, problem, called, noether, s, gap, it, was, finally, solved, independently, by, fleischmann, in, 2000, and, fogarty, in, 2001, who, both, showed, that, the, bound, remains, true, in, her, 1926, paper, noether, extended, hilbert, s, theorem, to, representations, of, a, finite, group, over, any, field, the, new, case, that, did, not, follow, from, hilbert, s, work, is, when, the, characteristic, of, the, field, divides, the, order, of, the, group, noether, s, result, was, later, extended, by, william, haboush, to, all, reductive, groups, by, his, proof, of, the, mumford, conjecture, in, this, paper, noether, also, introduced, the, noether, normalization, lemma, showing, that, a, finitely, generated, domain, a, over, a, field, k, has, a, set, x, 1, x, n, of, algebraically, independent, elements, such, that, a, is, integral, over, k, as, noted, by, hermann, weyl, in, his, obituary, noether, s, contributions, to, topology, illustrate, her, generosity, with, ideas, and, how, her, insights, could, transform, entire, fields, of, mathematics, in, topology, mathematicians, study, the, properties, of, objects, that, remain, invariant, even, under, deformation, properties, such, as, their, connectedness, an, old, joke, is, that, a, topologist, cannot, distinguish, a, donut, from, a, coffee, mug, since, they, can, be, continuously, deformed, into, one, another, noether, is, credited, with, fundamental, ideas, that, led, to, the, development, of, algebraic, topology, from, the, earlier, combinatorial, topology, specifically, the, idea, of, homology, groups, according, to, alexandrov, noether, attended, lectures, given, by, him, and, heinz, hopf, in, the, summers, of, 1926, and, 1927, where, she, continually, made, observations, which, were, often, deep, and, subtle, and, he, continues, that, when, she, first, became, acquainted, with, a, systematic, construction, of, combinatorial, topology, she, immediately, observed, that, it, would, be, worthwhile, to, study, directly, the, groups, of, algebraic, complexes, and, cycles, of, a, given, polyhedron, and, the, subgroup, of, the, cycle, group, consisting, of, cycles, homologous, to, zero, instead, of, the, usual, definition, of, betti, numbers, she, suggested, immediately, defining, the, betti, group, as, the, complementary, quotient, group, of, the, group, of, all, cycles, by, the, subgroup, of, cycles, homologous, to, zero, this, observation, now, seems, self, evident, but, in, those, years, 1925, 1928, this, was, a, completely, new, point, of, view, noether, s, suggestion, that, topology, be, studied, algebraically, was, adopted, immediately, by, hopf, alexandrov, and, others, and, it, became, a, frequent, topic, of, discussion, among, the, mathematicians, of, g, ttingen, noether, observed, that, her, idea, of, a, betti, group, makes, the, euler, poincar, formula, simpler, to, understand, and, hopf, s, own, work, on, this, subject, bears, the, imprint, of, these, remarks, of, emmy, noether, noether, mentions, her, own, topology, ideas, only, as, an, aside, in, a, 1926, publication, where, she, cites, it, as, an, application, of, group, theory, this, algebraic, approach, to, topology, was, also, developed, independently, in, austria, in, a, 1926, 1927, course, given, in, vienna, leopold, vietoris, defined, a, homology, group, which, was, developed, by, walther, mayer, into, an, axiomatic, definition, in, 1928, much, work, on, hypercomplex, numbers, and, group, representations, was, carried, out, in, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, but, remained, disparate, noether, united, these, earlier, results, and, gave, the, first, general, representation, theory, of, groups, and, algebras, this, single, work, by, noether, was, said, to, have, ushered, in, a, new, period, in, modern, algebra, and, to, have, been, of, fundamental, importance, for, its, development, briefly, noether, subsumed, the, structure, theory, of, associative, algebras, and, the, representation, theory, of, groups, into, a, single, arithmetic, theory, of, modules, and, ideals, in, rings, satisfying, ascending, chain, conditions, noether, also, was, responsible, for, a, number, of, other, advances, in, the, field, of, algebra, with, emil, artin, richard, brauer, and, helmut, hasse, she, founded, the, theory, of, central, simple, algebras, a, paper, by, noether, helmut, hasse, and, richard, brauer, pertains, to, division, algebras, which, are, algebraic, systems, in, which, division, is, possible, they, proved, two, important, theorems, a, local, global, theorem, stating, that, if, a, finite, dimensional, central, division, algebra, over, a, number, field, splits, locally, everywhere, then, it, splits, globally, so, is, trivial, and, from, this, deduced, their, hauptsatz, main, theorem, every, finite, dimensional, central, division, algebra, over, an, algebraic, number, field, f, splits, over, a, cyclic, cyclotomic, extension, these, theorems, allow, one, to, classify, all, finite, dimensional, central, division, algebras, over, a, given, number, field, a, subsequent, paper, by, noether, showed, as, a, special, case, of, a, more, general, theorem, that, all, maximal, subfields, of, a, division, algebra, d, are, splitting, fields, this, paper, also, contains, the, skolem, noether, theorem, which, states, that, any, two, embeddings, of, an, extension, of, a, field, k, into, a, finite, dimensional, central, simple, algebra, over, k, are, conjugate, the, brauer, noether, theorem, gives, a, characterization, of, the, splitting, fields, of, a, central, division, algebra, over, a, field, noether, s, work, continues, to, be, relevant, for, the, development, of, theoretical, physics, and, mathematics, and, she, is, consistently, ranked, as, one, of, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, the, twentieth, century, in, his, obituary, fellow, algebraist, b, l, van, der, waerden, says, that, her, mathematical, originality, was, absolute, beyond, comparison, and, hermann, weyl, said, that, noether, changed, the, face, of, algebra, by, her, work, mathematician, and, historian, jeremy, gray, wrote, that, any, textbook, on, abstract, algebra, bears, the, evidence, of, noether, s, contributions, mathematicians, simply, do, ring, theory, her, way, during, her, lifetime, and, even, until, today, noether, has, been, characterized, as, the, greatest, woman, mathematician, in, recorded, history, by, mathematicians, such, as, pavel, alexandrov, hermann, weyl, and, jean, dieudonn, in, a, letter, to, the, new, york, times, albert, einstein, wrote, in, the, judgment, of, the, most, competent, living, mathematicians, fr, ulein, noether, was, the, most, significant, creative, mathematical, genius, thus, far, produced, since, the, higher, education, of, women, began, in, the, realm, of, algebra, in, which, the, most, gifted, mathematicians, have, been, busy, for, centuries, she, discovered, methods, which, have, proved, of, enormous, importance, in, the, development, of, the, present, day, younger, generation, of, mathematicians
