william, thomson, 1st, baron, kelvin, om, gcvo, pc, frs, frse, 26, june, 1824, 17, december, 1907, was, a, british, mathematician, mathematical, physicist, and, engineer, born, in, belfast, he, was, the, professor, of, natural, philosophy, at, the, university, of, glasgow, for, 53, years, where, he, undertook, significant, research, and, mathematical, analysis, of, electricity, was, instrumental, in, the, formulation, of, the, first, and, second, laws, of, thermodynamics, and, contributed, significantly, to, unifying, physics, which, was, then, in, its, infancy, of, development, as, an, emerging, academic, discipline, he, received, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, in, 1883, and, served, as, its, president, from, 1890, to, 1895, in, 1892, he, became, the, first, scientist, to, be, elevated, to, the, house, of, lords, absolute, temperatures, are, stated, in, units, of, kelvin, in, lord, kelvin, s, honour, while, the, existence, of, a, coldest, possible, temperature, absolute, zero, was, known, before, his, work, kelvin, determined, its, correct, value, as, approximately, 273, 15, degrees, celsius, or, 459, 67, degrees, fahrenheit, the, joule, thomson, effect, is, also, named, in, his, honour, kelvin, worked, closely, with, mathematics, professor, hugh, blackburn, in, his, work, he, also, had, a, career, as, an, electrical, telegraph, engineer, and, inventor, which, propelled, him, into, the, public, eye, and, earned, him, wealth, fame, and, honours, for, his, work, on, the, transatlantic, telegraph, project, he, was, knighted, in, 1866, by, queen, victoria, becoming, sir, william, thomson, he, had, extensive, maritime, interests, and, worked, on, the, mariner, s, compass, which, previously, had, limited, reliability, kelvin, was, ennobled, in, 1892, in, recognition, of, his, achievements, in, thermodynamics, and, of, his, opposition, to, irish, home, rule, becoming, baron, kelvin, of, largs, in, the, county, of, ayr, the, title, refers, to, the, river, kelvin, which, flows, near, his, laboratory, at, the, university, of, glasgow, s, gilmorehill, home, at, hillhead, despite, offers, of, elevated, posts, from, several, world, renowned, universities, kelvin, refused, to, leave, glasgow, remaining, until, his, retirement, from, that, post, in, 1899, active, in, industrial, research, and, development, he, was, recruited, around, 1899, by, george, eastman, to, serve, as, vice, chairman, of, the, board, of, the, british, company, kodak, limited, affiliated, with, eastman, kodak, in, 1904, he, became, chancellor, of, the, university, of, glasgow, kelvin, resided, in, netherhall, a, redstone, mansion, in, largs, which, he, built, in, the, 1870s, and, where, he, died, in, 1907, the, hunterian, museum, at, the, university, of, glasgow, has, a, permanent, exhibition, on, the, work, of, kelvin, which, includes, many, of, his, original, papers, instruments, and, other, artefacts, including, his, smoking, pipe, thomson, s, father, james, thomson, was, a, teacher, of, mathematics, and, engineering, at, the, royal, belfast, academical, institution, and, the, son, of, a, farmer, james, thomson, married, margaret, gardner, in, 1817, and, of, their, children, four, boys, and, two, girls, survived, infancy, margaret, thomson, died, in, 1830, when, william, was, six, years, old, william, and, his, elder, brother, james, were, tutored, at, home, by, their, father, while, the, younger, boys, were, tutored, by, their, elder, sisters, james, was, intended, to, benefit, from, the, major, share, of, his, father, s, encouragement, affection, and, financial, support, and, was, prepared, for, a, career, in, engineering, in, 1832, his, father, was, appointed, professor, of, mathematics, at, glasgow, and, the, family, moved, there, in, october, 1833, the, thomson, children, were, introduced, to, a, broader, cosmopolitan, experience, than, their, father, s, rural, upbringing, spending, mid, 1839, in, london, and, the, boys, were, tutored, in, french, in, paris, much, of, thomson, s, life, during, the, mid, 1840s, was, spent, in, germany, and, the, netherlands, language, study, was, given, a, high, priority, his, sister, anna, thomson, was, the, mother, of, physicist, james, thomson, bottomley, frse, thomson, attended, the, royal, belfast, academical, institution, where, his, father, was, a, professor, in, the, university, department, in, 1834, aged, 10, he, began, studying, at, the, university, of, glasgow, not, out, of, any, precociousness, the, university, provided, many, of, the, facilities, of, an, elementary, school, for, able, pupils, and, this, was, a, typical, starting, age, in, school, he, showed, a, keen, interest, in, the, classics, along, with, his, natural, interest, in, the, sciences, at, age, 12, he, won, a, prize, for, translating, lucian, of, samosata, s, dialogues, of, the, gods, from, ancient, greek, to, english, in, the, academic, year, 1839, 1840, thomson, won, the, class, prize, in, astronomy, for, his, essay, on, the, figure, of, the, earth, which, showed, an, early, facility, for, mathematical, analysis, and, creativity, his, physics, tutor, at, this, time, was, his, namesake, david, thomson, throughout, his, life, he, would, work, on, the, problems, raised, in, the, essay, as, a, coping, strategy, during, times, of, personal, stress, on, the, title, page, of, this, essay, thomson, wrote, the, following, lines, from, alexander, pope, s, an, essay, on, man, these, lines, inspired, thomson, to, understand, the, natural, world, using, the, power, and, method, of, science, go, wondrous, creature, mount, where, science, guides, go, measure, earth, weigh, air, and, state, the, tides, instruct, the, planets, in, what, orbs, to, run, correct, old, time, and, regulate, the, sun, thomson, became, intrigued, with, joseph, fourier, s, th, orie, analytique, de, la, chaleur, the, analytical, theory, of, heat, and, committed, himself, to, study, the, continental, mathematics, resisted, by, a, british, establishment, still, working, in, the, shadow, of, sir, isaac, newton, unsurprisingly, fourier, s, work, had, been, attacked, by, domestic, mathematicians, philip, kelland, authoring, a, critical, book, the, book, motivated, thomson, to, write, his, first, published, scientific, paper, under, the, pseudonym, p, q, r, defending, fourier, which, was, submitted, to, the, cambridge, mathematical, journal, by, his, father, a, second, p, q, r, paper, followed, almost, immediately, while, on, holiday, with, his, family, in, lamlash, in, 1841, he, wrote, a, third, more, substantial, p, q, r, paper, on, the, uniform, motion, of, heat, in, homogeneous, solid, bodies, and, its, connection, with, the, mathematical, theory, of, electricity, in, the, paper, he, made, remarkable, connections, between, the, mathematical, theories, of, thermal, conduction, and, electrostatics, an, analogy, that, james, clerk, maxwell, was, ultimately, to, describe, as, one, of, the, most, valuable, science, forming, ideas, william, s, father, was, able, to, make, a, generous, provision, for, his, favourite, son, s, education, and, in, 1841, installed, him, with, extensive, letters, of, introduction, and, ample, accommodation, at, peterhouse, cambridge, while, at, cambridge, thomson, was, active, in, sports, athletics, and, sculling, winning, the, colquhoun, sculls, in, 1843, he, took, a, lively, interest, in, the, classics, music, and, literature, but, the, real, love, of, his, intellectual, life, was, the, pursuit, of, science, the, study, of, mathematics, physics, and, in, particular, of, electricity, had, captivated, his, imagination, in, 1845, thomson, graduated, as, second, wrangler, he, also, won, the, first, smith, s, prize, which, unlike, the, tripos, is, a, test, of, original, research, robert, leslie, ellis, one, of, the, examiners, is, said, to, have, declared, to, another, examiner, you, and, i, are, just, about, fit, to, mend, his, pens, in, 1845, he, gave, the, first, mathematical, development, of, michael, faraday, s, idea, that, electric, induction, takes, place, through, an, intervening, medium, or, dielectric, and, not, by, some, incomprehensible, action, at, a, distance, he, also, devised, the, mathematical, technique, of, electrical, images, which, became, a, powerful, agent, in, solving, problems, of, electrostatics, the, science, which, deals, with, the, forces, between, electrically, charged, bodies, at, rest, it, was, partly, in, response, to, his, encouragement, that, faraday, undertook, the, research, in, september, 1845, that, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, faraday, effect, which, established, that, light, and, magnetic, and, thus, electric, phenomena, were, related, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, st, peter, s, as, peterhouse, was, often, called, at, the, time, in, june, 1845, on, gaining, the, fellowship, he, spent, some, time, in, the, laboratory, of, the, celebrated, henri, victor, regnault, at, paris, but, in, 1846, he, was, appointed, to, the, chair, of, natural, philosophy, in, the, university, of, glasgow, at, age, 22, he, found, himself, wearing, the, gown, of, a, professor, in, one, of, the, oldest, universities, in, the, country, and, lecturing, to, the, class, of, which, he, was, a, first, year, student, a, few, years, before, by, 1847, thomson, had, already, gained, a, reputation, as, a, precocious, and, maverick, scientist, when, he, attended, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, annual, meeting, in, oxford, at, that, meeting, he, heard, james, prescott, joule, making, yet, another, of, his, so, far, ineffective, attempts, to, discredit, the, caloric, theory, of, heat, and, the, theory, of, the, heat, engine, built, upon, it, by, sadi, carnot, and, mile, clapeyron, joule, argued, for, the, mutual, convertibility, of, heat, and, mechanical, work, and, for, their, mechanical, equivalence, thomson, was, intrigued, but, sceptical, though, he, felt, that, joule, s, results, demanded, theoretical, explanation, he, retreated, into, an, even, deeper, commitment, to, the, carnot, clapeyron, school, he, predicted, that, the, melting, point, of, ice, must, fall, with, pressure, otherwise, its, expansion, on, freezing, could, be, exploited, in, a, perpetuum, mobile, experimental, confirmation, in, his, laboratory, did, much, to, bolster, his, beliefs, in, 1848, he, extended, the, carnot, clapeyron, theory, further, through, his, dissatisfaction, that, the, gas, thermometer, provided, only, an, operational, definition, of, temperature, he, proposed, an, absolute, temperature, scale, in, which, a, unit, of, heat, descending, from, a, body, a, at, the, temperature, t, of, this, scale, to, a, body, b, at, the, temperature, t, 1, would, give, out, the, same, mechanical, effect, whatever, be, the, number, t, such, a, scale, would, be, quite, independent, of, the, physical, properties, of, any, specific, substance, by, employing, such, a, waterfall, thomson, postulated, that, a, point, would, be, reached, at, which, no, further, heat, caloric, could, be, transferred, the, point, of, absolute, zero, about, which, guillaume, amontons, had, speculated, in, 1702, reflections, on, the, motive, power, of, heat, published, by, carnot, in, french, in, 1824, the, year, of, lord, kelvin, s, birth, used, 267, as, an, estimate, of, the, absolute, zero, temperature, thomson, used, data, published, by, regnault, to, calibrate, his, scale, against, established, measurements, in, his, publication, thomson, wrote, the, conversion, of, heat, or, caloric, into, mechanical, effect, is, probably, impossible, certainly, undiscovered, but, a, footnote, signalled, his, first, doubts, about, the, caloric, theory, referring, to, joule, s, very, remarkable, discoveries, surprisingly, thomson, did, not, send, joule, a, copy, of, his, paper, but, when, joule, eventually, read, it, he, wrote, to, thomson, on, 6, october, claiming, that, his, studies, had, demonstrated, conversion, of, heat, into, work, but, that, he, was, planning, further, experiments, thomson, replied, on, 27, october, revealing, that, he, was, planning, his, own, experiments, and, hoping, for, a, reconciliation, of, their, two, sides, thomson, returned, to, critique, carnot, s, original, publication, and, read, his, analysis, to, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, january, 1849, still, convinced, that, the, theory, was, fundamentally, sound, however, though, thomson, conducted, no, new, experiments, over, the, next, two, years, he, became, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, carnot, s, theory, and, convinced, of, joule, s, in, february, 1851, he, sat, down, to, articulate, his, new, thinking, he, was, uncertain, of, how, to, frame, his, theory, and, the, paper, went, through, several, drafts, before, he, settled, on, an, attempt, to, reconcile, carnot, and, joule, during, his, rewriting, he, seems, to, have, considered, ideas, that, would, subsequently, give, rise, to, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, in, carnot, s, theory, lost, heat, was, absolutely, lost, but, thomson, contended, that, it, was, lost, to, man, irrecoverably, but, not, lost, in, the, material, world, moreover, his, theological, beliefs, led, thomson, to, extrapolate, the, second, law, to, the, cosmos, originating, the, idea, of, universal, heat, death, i, believe, the, tendency, in, the, material, world, is, for, motion, to, become, diffused, and, that, as, a, whole, the, reverse, of, concentration, is, gradually, going, on, i, believe, that, no, physical, action, can, ever, restore, the, heat, emitted, from, the, sun, and, that, this, source, is, not, inexhaustible, also, that, the, motions, of, the, earth, and, other, planets, are, losing, vis, viva, which, is, converted, into, heat, and, that, although, some, vis, viva, may, be, restored, for, instance, to, the, earth, by, heat, received, from, the, sun, or, by, other, means, that, the, loss, cannot, be, precisely, compensated, and, i, think, it, probable, that, it, is, under, compensated, compensation, would, require, a, creative, act, or, an, act, possessing, similar, power, resulting, in, a, rejuvenating, universe, as, thomson, had, previously, compared, universal, heat, death, to, a, clock, running, slower, and, slower, although, he, was, unsure, whether, it, would, eventually, reach, thermodynamic, equilibrium, and, stop, for, ever, thomson, also, formulated, the, heat, death, paradox, kelvin, s, paradox, in, 1862, which, uses, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, to, disprove, the, possibility, of, an, infinitely, old, universe, this, paradox, was, later, extended, by, william, rankine, in, final, publication, thomson, retreated, from, a, radical, departure, and, declared, the, whole, theory, of, the, motive, power, of, heat, is, founded, on, two, propositions, due, respectively, to, joule, and, to, carnot, and, clausius, thomson, went, on, to, state, a, form, of, the, second, law, it, is, impossible, by, means, of, inanimate, material, agency, to, derive, mechanical, effect, from, any, portion, of, matter, by, cooling, it, below, the, temperature, of, the, coldest, of, the, surrounding, objects, in, the, paper, thomson, supports, the, theory, that, heat, was, a, form, of, motion, but, admits, that, he, had, been, influenced, only, by, the, thought, of, sir, humphry, davy, and, the, experiments, of, joule, and, julius, robert, von, mayer, maintaining, that, experimental, demonstration, of, the, conversion, of, heat, into, work, was, still, outstanding, as, soon, as, joule, read, the, paper, he, wrote, to, thomson, with, his, comments, and, questions, thus, began, a, fruitful, though, largely, epistolary, collaboration, between, the, two, men, joule, conducting, experiments, thomson, analysing, the, results, and, suggesting, further, experiments, the, collaboration, lasted, from, 1852, to, 1856, its, discoveries, including, the, joule, thomson, effect, sometimes, called, the, kelvin, joule, effect, and, the, published, results, did, much, to, bring, about, general, acceptance, of, joule, s, work, and, the, kinetic, theory, thomson, published, more, than, 650, scientific, papers, and, applied, for, 70, patents, not, all, were, issued, regarding, science, thomson, wrote, the, following, in, physical, science, a, first, essential, step, in, the, direction, of, learning, any, subject, is, to, find, principles, of, numerical, reckoning, and, practicable, methods, for, measuring, some, quality, connected, with, it, i, often, say, that, when, you, can, measure, what, you, are, speaking, about, and, express, it, in, numbers, you, know, something, about, it, but, when, you, cannot, measure, it, when, you, cannot, express, it, in, numbers, your, knowledge, is, of, a, meagre, and, unsatisfactory, kind, it, may, be, the, beginning, of, knowledge, but, you, have, scarcely, in, your, thoughts, advanced, to, the, stage, of, science, whatever, the, matter, may, be, though, eminent, in, the, academic, field, thomson, was, obscure, to, the, general, public, in, september, 1852, he, married, childhood, sweetheart, margaret, crum, daughter, of, walter, crum, but, her, health, broke, down, on, their, honeymoon, and, over, the, next, 17, years, thomson, was, distracted, by, her, suffering, on, 16, october, 1854, george, gabriel, stokes, wrote, to, thomson, to, try, to, re, interest, him, in, work, by, asking, his, opinion, on, some, experiments, of, faraday, on, the, proposed, transatlantic, telegraph, cable, faraday, had, demonstrated, how, the, construction, of, a, cable, would, limit, the, rate, at, which, messages, could, be, sent, in, modern, terms, the, bandwidth, thomson, jumped, at, the, problem, and, published, his, response, that, month, he, expressed, his, results, in, terms, of, the, data, rate, that, could, be, achieved, and, the, economic, consequences, in, terms, of, the, potential, revenue, of, the, transatlantic, undertaking, in, a, further, 1855, analysis, thomson, stressed, the, impact, that, the, design, of, the, cable, would, have, on, its, profitability, thomson, contended, that, the, signalling, speed, through, a, given, cable, was, inversely, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, length, of, the, cable, thomson, s, results, were, disputed, at, a, meeting, of, the, british, association, in, 1856, by, wildman, whitehouse, the, electrician, of, the, atlantic, telegraph, company, whitehouse, had, possibly, misinterpreted, the, results, of, his, own, experiments, but, was, doubtless, feeling, financial, pressure, as, plans, for, the, cable, were, already, well, under, way, he, believed, that, thomson, s, calculations, implied, that, the, cable, must, be, abandoned, as, being, practically, and, commercially, impossible, thomson, attacked, whitehouse, s, contention, in, a, letter, to, the, popular, athenaeum, magazine, pitching, himself, into, the, public, eye, thomson, recommended, a, larger, conductor, with, a, larger, cross, section, of, insulation, he, thought, whitehouse, no, fool, and, suspected, that, he, might, have, the, practical, skill, to, make, the, existing, design, work, thomson, s, work, had, attracted, the, attention, of, the, project, s, undertakers, in, december, 1856, he, was, elected, to, the, board, of, directors, of, the, atlantic, telegraph, company, thomson, became, scientific, adviser, to, a, team, with, whitehouse, as, chief, electrician, and, sir, charles, tilston, bright, as, chief, engineer, but, whitehouse, had, his, way, with, the, specification, supported, by, faraday, and, samuel, f, b, morse, thomson, sailed, on, board, the, cable, laying, ship, hms, agamemnon, in, august, 1857, with, whitehouse, confined, to, land, owing, to, illness, but, the, voyage, ended, after, 380, miles, 610, km, when, the, cable, parted, thomson, contributed, to, the, effort, by, publishing, in, the, engineer, the, whole, theory, of, the, stresses, involved, in, the, laying, of, a, submarine, communications, cable, showing, when, the, line, is, running, out, of, the, ship, at, a, constant, speed, in, a, uniform, depth, of, water, it, sinks, in, a, slant, or, straight, incline, from, the, point, where, it, enters, the, water, to, that, where, it, touches, the, bottom, thomson, developed, a, complete, system, for, operating, a, submarine, telegraph, that, was, capable, of, sending, a, character, every, 3, 5, seconds, he, patented, the, key, elements, of, his, system, the, mirror, galvanometer, and, the, siphon, recorder, in, 1858, whitehouse, still, felt, able, to, ignore, thomson, s, many, suggestions, and, proposals, it, was, not, until, thomson, convinced, the, board, that, using, purer, copper, for, replacing, the, lost, section, of, cable, would, improve, data, capacity, that, he, first, made, a, difference, to, the, execution, of, the, project, the, board, insisted, that, thomson, join, the, 1858, cable, laying, expedition, without, any, financial, compensation, and, take, an, active, part, in, the, project, in, return, thomson, secured, a, trial, for, his, mirror, galvanometer, which, the, board, had, been, unenthusiastic, about, alongside, whitehouse, s, equipment, thomson, found, the, access, he, was, given, unsatisfactory, and, the, agamemnon, had, to, return, home, following, a, disastrous, storm, in, june, 1858, in, london, the, board, was, about, to, abandon, the, project, and, mitigate, their, losses, by, selling, the, cable, thomson, cyrus, west, field, and, curtis, m, lampson, argued, for, another, attempt, and, prevailed, thomson, insisting, that, the, technical, problems, were, tractable, though, employed, in, an, advisory, capacity, thomson, had, during, the, voyages, developed, a, real, engineer, s, instincts, and, skill, at, practical, problem, solving, under, pressure, often, taking, the, lead, in, dealing, with, emergencies, and, being, unafraid, to, assist, in, manual, work, a, cable, was, completed, on, 5, august, thomson, s, fears, were, realised, when, whitehouse, s, apparatus, proved, insufficiently, sensitive, and, had, to, be, replaced, by, thomson, s, mirror, galvanometer, whitehouse, continued, to, maintain, that, it, was, his, equipment, that, was, providing, the, service, and, started, to, engage, in, desperate, measures, to, remedy, some, of, the, problems, he, fatally, damaged, the, cable, by, applying, 2, 000, volts, when, the, cable, failed, completely, whitehouse, was, dismissed, though, thomson, objected, and, was, reprimanded, by, the, board, for, his, interference, thomson, subsequently, regretted, that, he, had, acquiesced, too, readily, to, many, of, whitehouse, s, proposals, and, had, not, challenged, him, with, sufficient, vigour, a, joint, committee, of, inquiry, was, established, by, the, board, of, trade, and, the, atlantic, telegraph, company, most, of, the, blame, for, the, cable, s, failure, was, found, to, rest, with, whitehouse, the, committee, found, that, though, underwater, cables, were, notorious, in, their, lack, of, reliability, most, of, the, problems, arose, from, known, and, avoidable, causes, thomson, was, appointed, one, of, a, five, member, committee, to, recommend, a, specification, for, a, new, cable, the, committee, reported, in, october, 1863, in, july, 1865, thomson, sailed, on, the, cable, laying, expedition, of, the, ss, great, eastern, but, the, voyage, was, dogged, by, technical, problems, the, cable, was, lost, after, 1, 200, miles, 1, 900, km, had, been, laid, and, the, project, was, abandoned, a, further, attempt, in, 1866, laid, a, new, cable, in, two, weeks, and, then, recovered, and, completed, the, 1865, cable, the, enterprise, was, feted, as, a, triumph, by, the, public, and, thomson, enjoyed, a, large, share, of, the, adulation, thomson, along, with, the, other, principals, of, the, project, was, knighted, on, 10, november, 1866, to, exploit, his, inventions, for, signalling, on, long, submarine, cables, thomson, entered, into, a, partnership, with, c, f, varley, and, fleeming, jenkin, in, conjunction, with, the, latter, he, also, devised, an, automatic, curb, sender, a, kind, of, telegraph, key, for, sending, messages, on, a, cable, thomson, took, part, in, the, laying, of, the, french, atlantic, submarine, communications, cable, of, 1869, and, with, jenkin, was, engineer, of, the, western, and, brazilian, and, platino, brazilian, cables, assisted, by, vacation, student, james, alfred, ewing, he, was, present, at, the, laying, of, the, par, to, pernambuco, section, of, the, brazilian, coast, cables, in, 1873, thomson, s, wife, margaret, died, on, 17, june, 1870, and, he, resolved, to, make, changes, in, his, life, already, addicted, to, seafaring, in, september, he, purchased, a, 126, ton, schooner, the, lalla, rookh, and, used, it, as, a, base, for, entertaining, friends, and, scientific, colleagues, his, maritime, interests, continued, in, 1871, when, he, was, appointed, to, the, board, of, enquiry, into, the, sinking, of, hms, captain, in, june, 1873, thomson, and, jenkin, were, on, board, the, hooper, bound, for, lisbon, with, 2, 500, miles, 4, 020, km, of, cable, when, the, cable, developed, a, fault, an, unscheduled, 16, day, stop, over, in, madeira, followed, and, thomson, became, good, friends, with, charles, r, blandy, and, his, three, daughters, on, 2, may, 1874, he, set, sail, for, madeira, on, the, lalla, rookh, as, he, approached, the, harbour, he, signalled, to, the, blandy, residence, will, you, marry, me, and, fanny, blandy, s, daughter, frances, anna, blandy, signalled, back, yes, thomson, married, fanny, 13, years, his, junior, on, 24, june, 1874, over, the, period, 1855, to, 1867, thomson, collaborated, with, peter, guthrie, tait, on, a, textbook, that, founded, the, study, of, mechanics, first, on, the, mathematics, of, kinematics, the, description, of, motion, without, regard, to, force, the, text, developed, dynamics, in, various, areas, but, with, constant, attention, to, energy, as, a, unifying, principle, a, second, edition, appeared, in, 1879, expanded, to, two, separately, bound, parts, the, textbook, set, a, standard, for, early, education, in, mathematical, physics, thomson, made, significant, contributions, to, atmospheric, electricity, for, the, relatively, short, time, for, which, he, worked, on, the, subject, around, 1859, he, developed, several, instruments, for, measuring, the, atmospheric, electric, field, using, some, of, the, electrometers, he, had, initially, developed, for, telegraph, work, which, he, tested, at, glasgow, and, whilst, on, holiday, on, arran, his, measurements, on, arran, were, sufficiently, rigorous, and, well, calibrated, that, they, could, be, used, to, deduce, air, pollution, from, the, glasgow, area, through, its, effects, on, the, atmospheric, electric, field, thomson, s, water, dropper, electrometer, was, used, for, measuring, the, atmospheric, electric, field, at, kew, observatory, and, eskdalemuir, observatory, for, many, years, and, one, was, still, in, use, operationally, at, the, kakioka, observatory, in, japan, until, early, 2021, thomson, may, have, unwittingly, observed, atmospheric, electrical, effects, caused, by, the, carrington, event, a, significant, geomagnetic, storm, in, early, september, 1859, between, 1870, and, 1890, the, vortex, atom, theory, which, purported, that, an, atom, was, a, vortex, in, the, aether, was, popular, among, british, physicists, and, mathematicians, thomson, pioneered, the, theory, which, was, distinct, from, the, 17th, century, vortex, theory, of, ren, descartes, in, that, thomson, was, thinking, in, terms, of, a, unitary, continuum, theory, whereas, descartes, was, thinking, in, terms, of, three, different, types, of, matter, each, relating, respectively, to, emission, transmission, and, reflection, of, light, about, 60, scientific, papers, were, written, by, approximately, 25, scientists, following, the, lead, of, thomson, and, tait, the, branch, of, topology, called, knot, theory, was, developed, thomson, s, initiative, in, this, complex, study, that, continues, to, inspire, new, mathematics, has, led, to, persistence, of, the, topic, in, history, of, science, thomson, was, an, enthusiastic, yachtsman, his, interest, in, all, things, relating, to, the, sea, perhaps, arising, from, or, fostered, by, his, experiences, on, the, agamemnon, and, the, great, eastern, thomson, introduced, a, new, method, of, deep, sea, depth, sounding, in, which, a, steel, piano, wire, replaces, the, ordinary, hand, line, the, wire, glides, so, easily, to, the, bottom, that, flying, soundings, can, be, taken, while, the, ship, is, at, full, speed, thomson, added, a, pressure, gauge, to, register, the, depth, of, the, sinker, about, the, same, time, he, revived, the, sumner, method, of, finding, a, ship, s, position, and, calculated, a, set, of, tables, for, its, ready, application, during, the, 1880s, thomson, worked, to, perfect, the, adjustable, compass, to, correct, errors, arising, from, magnetic, deviation, owing, to, the, increased, use, of, iron, in, naval, architecture, thomson, s, design, was, a, great, improvement, on, the, older, instruments, being, steadier, and, less, hampered, by, friction, the, deviation, caused, by, the, ship, s, magnetism, was, corrected, by, movable, iron, masses, at, the, binnacle, thomson, s, innovations, involved, much, detailed, work, to, develop, principles, identified, by, george, biddell, airy, and, others, but, contributed, little, in, terms, of, novel, physical, thinking, thomson, s, energetic, lobbying, and, networking, proved, effective, in, gaining, acceptance, of, his, instrument, by, the, admiralty, scientific, biographers, of, thomson, if, they, have, paid, any, attention, at, all, to, his, compass, innovations, have, generally, taken, the, matter, to, be, a, sorry, saga, of, dim, witted, naval, administrators, resisting, marvellous, innovations, from, a, superlative, scientific, mind, writers, sympathetic, to, the, navy, on, the, other, hand, portray, thomson, as, a, man, of, undoubted, talent, and, enthusiasm, with, some, genuine, knowledge, of, the, sea, who, managed, to, parlay, a, handful, of, modest, ideas, in, compass, design, into, a, commercial, monopoly, for, his, own, manufacturing, concern, using, his, reputation, as, a, bludgeon, in, the, law, courts, to, beat, down, even, small, claims, of, originality, from, others, and, persuading, the, admiralty, and, the, law, to, overlook, both, the, deficiencies, of, his, own, design, and, the, virtues, of, his, competitors, the, truth, inevitably, seems, to, lie, somewhere, between, the, two, extremes, charles, babbage, had, been, among, the, first, to, suggest, that, a, lighthouse, might, be, made, to, signal, a, distinctive, number, by, occultations, of, its, light, but, thomson, pointed, out, the, merits, of, the, morse, code, for, the, purpose, and, urged, that, the, signals, should, consist, of, short, and, long, flashes, of, the, light, to, represent, the, dots, and, dashes, thomson, did, more, than, any, other, electrician, up, to, his, time, in, introducing, accurate, methods, and, apparati, for, measuring, electricity, as, early, as, 1845, he, pointed, out, that, the, experimental, results, of, william, snow, harris, were, in, accordance, with, the, laws, of, coulomb, in, the, memoirs, of, the, roman, academy, of, sciences, for, 1857, he, published, a, description, of, his, divided, ring, electrometer, based, on, the, electroscope, of, johann, gottlieb, friedrich, von, bohnenberger, he, introduced, a, chain, or, series, of, effective, instruments, including, the, quadrant, electrometer, which, cover, the, entire, field, of, electrostatic, measurement, he, invented, the, current, balance, also, known, as, the, kelvin, balance, or, ampere, balance, sic, for, the, precise, specification, of, the, ampere, the, standard, unit, of, electric, current, from, around, 1880, he, was, aided, by, the, electrical, engineer, magnus, maclean, frse, in, his, electrical, experiments, in, 1893, thomson, headed, an, international, commission, to, decide, on, the, design, of, the, niagara, falls, power, station, despite, his, belief, in, the, superiority, of, direct, current, electric, power, transmission, he, endorsed, westinghouse, s, alternating, current, system, which, had, been, demonstrated, at, the, chicago, world, s, fair, of, that, year, even, after, niagara, falls, thomson, still, held, to, his, belief, that, direct, current, was, the, superior, system, acknowledging, his, contribution, to, electrical, standardisation, the, international, electrotechnical, commission, elected, thomson, as, its, first, president, at, its, preliminary, meeting, held, in, london, on, 26, 27, june, 1906, on, the, proposal, of, the, president, secounded, by, mr, mailloux, the, right, honorable, lord, kelvin, g, c, v, o, o, m, was, unanimously, elected, first, president, of, the, commission, minutes, of, the, preliminary, meeting, report, read, kelvin, made, an, early, physics, based, estimation, of, the, age, of, earth, given, his, youthful, work, on, the, figure, of, earth, and, his, interest, in, heat, conduction, it, is, no, surprise, that, he, chose, to, investigate, earth, s, cooling, and, to, make, historical, inferences, of, earth, s, age, from, his, calculations, thomson, was, a, creationist, in, a, broad, sense, but, he, was, not, a, flood, geologist, a, view, that, had, lost, mainstream, scientific, support, by, the, 1840s, he, contended, that, the, laws, of, thermodynamics, operated, from, the, birth, of, the, universe, and, envisaged, a, dynamic, process, that, saw, the, organisation, and, evolution, of, the, solar, system, and, other, structures, followed, by, a, gradual, heat, death, he, developed, the, view, that, earth, had, once, been, too, hot, to, support, life, and, contrasted, this, view, with, that, of, uniformitarianism, that, conditions, had, remained, constant, since, the, indefinite, past, he, contended, that, this, earth, certainly, a, moderate, number, of, millions, of, years, ago, was, a, red, hot, globe, after, the, publication, of, charles, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, thomson, saw, evidence, of, the, relatively, short, habitable, age, of, earth, as, tending, to, contradict, darwin, s, gradualist, explanation, of, slow, natural, selection, bringing, about, biological, diversity, thomson, s, own, views, favoured, a, version, of, theistic, evolution, sped, up, by, divine, guidance, his, calculations, showed, that, the, sun, could, not, have, possibly, existed, long, enough, to, allow, the, slow, incremental, development, by, evolution, unless, it, was, heated, by, an, energy, source, beyond, the, knowledge, of, victorian, era, science, he, was, soon, drawn, into, public, disagreement, with, geologists, and, with, darwin, s, supporters, john, tyndall, and, t, h, huxley, in, his, response, to, huxley, s, address, to, the, geological, society, of, london, 1868, he, presented, his, address, of, geological, dynamics, 1869, which, among, his, other, writings, challenged, the, geologists, assertion, that, earth, must, be, vastly, old, perhaps, billions, of, years, in, age, thomson, s, initial, 1864, estimate, of, earth, s, age, was, from, 20, to, 400, million, years, old, these, wide, limits, were, due, to, his, uncertainty, about, the, melting, temperature, of, rock, to, which, he, equated, earth, s, interior, temperature, as, well, as, the, uncertainty, in, thermal, conductivities, and, specific, heats, of, rocks, over, the, years, he, refined, his, arguments, and, reduced, the, upper, bound, by, a, factor, of, ten, and, in, 1897, thomson, now, lord, kelvin, ultimately, settled, on, an, estimate, that, earth, was, 20, 40, million, years, old, in, a, letter, published, in, scientific, american, supplement, 1895, kelvin, criticized, geologists, estimates, of, the, age, of, rocks, and, the, age, of, earth, including, the, views, published, by, darwin, as, vaguely, vast, age, his, exploration, of, this, estimate, can, be, found, in, his, 1897, address, to, the, victoria, institute, given, at, the, request, of, the, institute, s, president, george, stokes, as, recorded, in, that, institute, s, journal, transactions, although, his, former, assistant, john, perry, published, a, paper, in, 1895, challenging, kelvin, s, assumption, of, low, thermal, conductivity, inside, earth, and, thus, showing, a, much, greater, age, this, had, little, immediate, impact, the, discovery, in, 1903, that, radioactive, decay, releases, heat, led, to, kelvin, s, estimate, being, challenged, and, ernest, rutherford, famously, made, the, argument, in, a, 1904, lecture, attended, by, kelvin, that, this, provided, the, unknown, energy, source, kelvin, had, suggested, but, the, estimate, was, not, overturned, until, the, development, in, 1907, of, radiometric, dating, of, rocks, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, largely, invalidated, kelvin, s, estimate, of, the, age, of, earth, although, he, eventually, paid, off, a, gentleman, s, bet, with, strutt, on, the, importance, of, radioactivity, in, earth, s, geology, he, never, publicly, acknowledged, this, because, he, thought, he, had, a, much, stronger, argument, restricting, the, age, of, the, sun, to, no, more, than, 20, million, years, without, sunlight, there, could, be, no, explanation, for, the, sediment, record, on, earth, s, surface, at, the, time, the, only, known, source, for, solar, energy, was, gravitational, collapse, it, was, only, when, thermonuclear, fusion, was, recognised, in, the, 1930s, that, kelvin, s, age, paradox, was, truly, resolved, however, modern, cosmology, recognizes, the, kelvin, period, in, the, early, life, of, a, star, during, which, it, shines, from, gravitational, energy, correctly, calculated, by, kelvin, before, fusion, and, the, main, sequence, begins, in, the, winter, of, 1860, 61, kelvin, slipped, on, the, ice, while, curling, near, his, home, at, netherhall, and, fractured, his, leg, causing, him, to, miss, the, 1861, manchester, meeting, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, and, to, limp, thereafter, he, remained, something, of, a, celebrity, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, until, his, death, thomson, remained, a, devout, believer, in, christianity, throughout, his, life, attendance, at, chapel, was, part, of, his, daily, routine, he, saw, his, christian, faith, as, supporting, and, informing, his, scientific, work, as, is, evident, from, his, address, to, the, annual, meeting, of, the, christian, evidence, society, on, 23, may, 1889, in, the, 1902, coronation, honours, list, published, on, 26, june, 1902, the, original, day, of, the, coronation, of, edward, vii, and, alexandra, kelvin, was, appointed, a, privy, councillor, and, one, of, the, first, members, of, the, new, order, of, merit, om, he, received, the, order, from, the, king, on, 8, august, 1902, and, was, sworn, a, member, of, the, council, at, buckingham, palace, on, 11, august, 1902, in, his, later, years, he, often, travelled, to, his, town, house, at, 15, eaton, place, off, eaton, square, in, london, s, belgravia, in, november, 1907, he, caught, a, chill, and, his, condition, deteriorated, until, he, died, at, his, scottish, country, seat, netherhall, in, largs, on, 17, december, at, the, request, of, westminster, abbey, the, undertakers, wylie, lochhead, prepared, an, oak, coffin, lined, with, lead, in, the, dark, of, the, winter, evening, the, cortege, set, off, from, netherhall, for, largs, railway, station, a, distance, of, about, a, mile, large, crowds, witnessed, the, passing, of, the, cortege, and, shopkeepers, closed, their, premises, and, dimmed, their, lights, the, coffin, was, placed, in, a, special, midland, and, glasgow, and, south, western, railway, van, the, train, set, off, at, 8, 30, pm, for, kilmarnock, where, the, van, was, attached, to, the, overnight, express, to, st, pancras, railway, station, in, london, kelvin, s, funeral, was, on, 23, december, 1907, the, abbey, was, crowded, including, representatives, from, the, university, of, glasgow, and, the, university, of, cambridge, along, with, representatives, from, france, italy, germany, austria, hungary, russia, the, united, states, canada, australia, japan, and, monaco, kelvin, s, grave, is, in, the, nave, near, the, choir, screen, and, close, to, the, graves, of, isaac, newton, john, herschel, and, charles, darwin, darwin, s, son, sir, george, darwin, was, one, of, the, pall, bearers, the, university, of, glasgow, held, a, memorial, service, for, kelvin, in, the, bute, hall, kelvin, had, been, a, member, of, the, scottish, episcopal, church, attached, to, st, columba, s, episcopal, church, in, largs, and, when, in, glasgow, to, st, mary, s, episcopal, church, now, st, mary, s, cathedral, glasgow, at, the, same, time, as, the, funeral, in, westminster, abbey, a, service, was, held, in, st, columba, s, episcopal, church, largs, attended, by, a, large, congregation, including, burgh, dignitaries, lord, kelvin, is, memorialised, on, the, thomson, family, grave, in, glasgow, necropolis, the, family, grave, has, a, second, modern, memorial, erected, by, the, royal, philosophical, society, of, glasgow, a, society, of, which, he, was, president, in, the, periods, 1856, 58, and, 1874, 77, in, 1884, lord, kelvin, led, a, master, class, on, molecular, dynamics, and, the, wave, theory, of, light, at, johns, hopkins, university, kelvin, referred, to, the, acoustic, wave, equation, describing, sound, as, waves, of, pressure, in, air, and, attempted, to, describe, also, an, electromagnetic, wave, equation, presuming, a, luminiferous, aether, susceptible, to, vibration, the, study, group, included, albert, a, michelson, and, edward, w, morley, who, subsequently, performed, the, michelson, morley, experiment, which, found, no, luminiferous, aether, kelvin, did, not, provide, a, text, but, a, s, hathaway, took, notes, and, duplicated, them, with, a, papyrograph, as, the, subject, matter, was, under, active, development, kelvin, amended, that, text, and, in, 1904, it, was, typeset, and, published, kelvin, s, attempts, to, provide, mechanical, models, ultimately, failed, in, the, electromagnetic, regime, starting, from, his, lecture, in, 1884, he, was, the, first, scientist, to, formulate, the, hypothetical, concept, of, dark, matter, he, then, attempted, to, define, and, locate, some, dark, bodies, in, the, milky, way, he, was, skeptical, about, maxwell, s, prediction, of, radiation, pressure, but, admitted, that, it, did, exist, after, seeing, pyotr, lebedev, s, experimental, proof, of, radiation, pressure, on, 27, april, 1900, he, gave, a, widely, reported, lecture, titled, nineteenth, century, clouds, over, the, dynamical, theory, of, heat, and, light, to, the, royal, institution, the, two, dark, clouds, he, was, alluding, to, were, confusion, surrounding, how, matter, moves, through, the, aether, including, the, puzzling, results, of, the, michelson, morley, experiment, and, indications, that, the, equipartition, theorem, in, statistical, mechanics, might, break, down, two, major, physical, theories, were, developed, during, the, 20th, century, starting, from, these, issues, for, the, former, the, theory, of, relativity, for, the, second, quantum, mechanics, in, 1905, albert, einstein, published, the, so, called, annus, mirabilis, papers, one, of, which, explained, the, photoelectric, effect, based, on, max, planck, s, discovery, of, energy, quanta, which, was, the, foundation, of, quantum, mechanics, another, of, which, described, special, relativity, and, the, last, of, which, explained, brownian, motion, in, terms, of, statistical, mechanics, providing, a, strong, argument, for, the, existence, of, atoms, like, many, scientists, thomson, made, some, mistakes, in, predicting, the, future, of, technology, his, biographer, silvanus, p, thompson, writes, that, when, r, ntgen, s, discovery, of, the, x, rays, was, announced, at, the, end, of, 1895, lord, kelvin, was, entirely, skeptical, and, regarded, the, announcement, as, a, hoax, the, papers, had, been, full, of, the, wonders, of, r, ntgen, s, rays, about, which, lord, kelvin, was, intensely, skeptical, until, r, ntgen, himself, sent, him, a, copy, of, his, memoir, on, 17, january, 1896, having, read, the, paper, and, seen, the, photographs, he, wrote, r, ntgen, a, letter, saying, that, i, need, not, tell, you, that, when, i, read, the, paper, i, was, very, much, astonished, and, delighted, i, can, say, no, more, now, than, to, congratulate, you, warmly, on, the, great, discovery, you, have, made, kelvin, had, his, own, hand, x, rayed, in, may, 1896, his, forecast, for, practical, aviation, i, e, heavier, than, air, aircraft, was, negative, in, 1896, he, refused, an, invitation, to, join, the, aeronautical, society, writing, i, have, not, the, smallest, molecule, of, faith, in, aerial, navigation, other, than, ballooning, or, of, expectation, of, good, results, from, any, of, the, trials, we, hear, of, in, a, 1902, newspaper, interview, he, predicted, that, no, balloon, and, no, aeroplane, will, ever, be, practically, successful, a, statement, falsely, attributed, to, kelvin, is, there, is, nothing, new, to, be, discovered, in, physics, now, all, that, remains, is, more, and, more, precise, measurement, this, has, been, widely, misattributed, to, kelvin, since, the, 1980s, either, without, citation, or, stating, that, it, was, made, in, an, address, to, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, 1900, there, is, no, evidence, that, kelvin, said, this, and, the, quote, is, instead, a, paraphrase, of, albert, a, michelson, who, in, 1894, stated, it, seems, probable, that, most, of, the, grand, underlying, principles, have, been, firmly, established, an, eminent, physicist, remarked, that, the, future, truths, of, physical, science, are, to, be, looked, for, in, the, sixth, place, of, decimals, similar, statements, were, given, earlier, by, others, such, as, philipp, von, jolly, the, attribution, to, kelvin, in, 1900, is, presumably, a, confusion, with, his, two, clouds, lecture, and, which, on, the, contrary, pointed, out, areas, that, would, subsequently, see, revolutions, in, 1898, kelvin, predicted, that, only, 400, years, of, oxygen, supply, remained, on, the, planet, due, to, the, rate, of, burning, combustibles, in, his, calculation, kelvin, assumed, that, photosynthesis, was, the, only, source, of, free, oxygen, he, did, not, know, all, of, the, components, of, the, oxygen, cycle, he, could, not, even, have, known, all, of, the, sources, of, photosynthesis, for, example, the, cyanobacterium, prochlorococcus, which, accounts, for, more, than, half, of, marine, photosynthesis, was, not, discovered, until, 1986, a, variety, of, physical, phenomena, and, concepts, with, which, thomson, is, associated, are, named, kelvin, including, mount, kelvin, in, new, zealand, s, paparoa, range, was, named, after, him, by, botanist, william, trownson
