xunzi, chinese, lit, master, xun, c, 310, c, after, 238, bce, born, xun, kuang, chinese, was, a, chinese, philosopher, of, confucianism, during, the, late, warring, states, period, after, his, predecessors, confucius, and, mencius, xunzi, is, often, ranked, as, the, third, great, confucian, philosopher, of, antiquity, by, his, time, confucianism, had, suffered, considerable, criticism, from, daoist, and, mohist, thinkers, and, xunzi, is, traditionally, regarded, as, a, synthesizer, of, these, traditions, with, earlier, confucian, thought, the, result, was, a, thorough, and, cohesive, revision, of, confucianism, which, was, crucial, to, the, philosophy, s, ability, to, flourish, in, the, han, dynasty, and, throughout, the, later, history, of, east, asia, his, works, were, compiled, in, the, eponymous, xunzi, and, survive, in, excellent, condition, unlike, other, ancient, compilations, his, authorship, of, these, texts, is, generally, secure, though, it, is, likely, that, western, han, dynasty, historian, liu, xiang, organized, them, into, their, present, form, centuries, after, xunzi, s, death, born, in, the, state, of, zhao, xunzi, studied, at, the, prestigious, jixia, academy, where, he, learned, about, every, major, philosophical, tradition, of, his, time, after, his, graduation, xunzi, traveled, to, chu, where, he, mastered, poetry, and, then, returned, to, qi, as, a, highly, regarded, teacher, at, the, academy, his, students, han, fei, and, li, si, each, had, an, important, political, and, academic, careers, though, some, of, their, legalist, sentiments, were, at, odds, with, his, philosophy, other, students, such, as, fuqiu, bo, zhang, cang, and, mao, heng, authored, important, editions, and, commentaries, on, the, confucian, classics, later, in, his, life, worked, in, the, court, of, lord, chunshen, whose, death, he, died, sometime, after, the, constant, warfare, of, his, time, informed, his, work, profoundly, as, did, his, interactions, with, leaders, and, witnessing, the, downfall, of, various, states, xunzi, s, writings, respond, to, dozens, of, other, thinkers, whom, he, often, directly, names, and, criticizes, his, well, known, notion, that, human, nature, is, evil, has, led, many, commentators, to, place, him, opposite, of, mencius, who, believed, human, nature, was, intrinsically, good, though, like, mencius, xunzi, believed, that, education, and, ritual, were, the, key, to, self, cultivation, and, thus, the, method, to, circumvent, one, s, naturally, foul, nature, his, definition, of, both, concepts, was, loose, and, he, encouraged, lifelong, education, and, applied, ritual, to, every, aspect, of, life, other, important, topics, include, the, promotion, of, music, and, the, careful, application, of, names, though, he, still, cited, the, ancient, sages, he, differed, from, other, confucian, philosophers, by, his, insistence, on, emulating, recent, rulers, rather, than, those, of, long, ago, repeated, oversimplifications, and, misunderstandings, on, xunzi, s, teachings, particularly, his, view, on, human, nature, led, to, gradual, dismissal, and, condemnation, of, his, thought, from, the, tang, dynasty, onwards, by, the, rise, of, neo, confucianism, in, the, 10th, century, mencius, gradually, upended, xunzi, particularly, by, the, choice, to, include, the, mencius, in, the, four, books, since, the, 20th, century, a, reevaluation, of, xunzi, s, doctrine, has, taken, place, in, east, asia, leading, to, recognition, of, his, profound, impact, and, relevance, to, both, his, times, and, present, day, detailed, information, concerning, xunzi, is, largely, nonexistent, yet, when, compared, to, the, scarcity, of, knowledge, for, many, other, ancient, chinese, philosophers, there, is, meaningful, and, significant, extant, information, on, the, life, of, xunzi, the, sinologist, john, h, knoblock, asserts, that, the, sources, available, permit, not, only, a, reconstruction, of, the, outlines, of, career, but, also, an, understanding, of, his, intellectual, development, xunzi, s, writings, have, survived, in, exceptionally, good, condition, and, while, they, provide, biographical, details, the, authenticity, of, this, information, is, sometimes, questionable, in, addition, to, these, the, main, source, for, xunzi, s, life, is, sima, qian, s, shiji, records, of, the, grand, historian, which, includes, a, biography, of, xunzi, sj, 74, 12, 14, and, mentions, of, him, in, the, biographies, of, both, li, si, sj, 78, 15, and, lord, of, chunshen, sj, 87, 1, 2, 14, the, western, han, dynasty, historian, liu, xiang, revised, and, expanded, sima, qian, s, initial, biography, for, the, preface, of, the, first, edition, of, xunzi, s, writings, some, minor, references, to, xunzi, also, exist, in, ying, shao, s, paraphrase, of, liu, xiang, s, preface, as, well, as, brief, mentions, in, the, han, feizi, zhan, guo, ce, and, yantie, lun, the, warring, states, period, c, 475, 221, bce, an, era, of, immense, disunity, and, warfare, had, been, raging, for, over, a, hundred, years, by, the, time, of, xunzi, s, birth, in, the, late, 4th, century, bce, yet, this, time, also, saw, considerable, innovations, in, chinese, philosophy, referred, to, as, the, hundred, schools, of, thought, the, primary, schools, were, confucianism, daoism, legalism, mohism, the, school, of, names, and, the, yin, yang, school, xunzi, was, a, philosopher, in, the, tradition, of, confucianism, begun, by, confucius, who, lived, over, two, centuries, before, him, xunzi, was, born, as, xun, kuang, probably, around, 310, bce, but, certainly, before, 279, bce, in, his, time, he, was, probably, known, as, xun, qing, meaning, minister, xun, or, chamberlain, xun, after, his, later, position, some, texts, give, his, surname, as, sun, instead, of, xun, though, this, may, have, been, to, avoid, naming, taboo, during, the, reign, of, emperor, xuan, of, han, 73, 48, bce, whose, given, name, was, xun, he, is, best, known, by, his, honorary, title, xunzi, translated, to, master, xun, with, zi, being, a, common, epithet, for, important, philosophers, his, birthplace, was, zhao, a, state, in, the, modern, day, shanxi, province, of, north, central, china, it, is, possible, xunzi, was, descended, from, the, xun, family, an, elite, clan, that, had, diminished, following, the, partition, of, jin, though, this, is, only, speculation, the, eastern, han, dynasty, historian, ying, shao, records, that, in, his, youth, xunzi, was, a, flowering, talent, in, matters, of, scholarship, and, academics, essentially, nothing, else, is, known, of, xunzi, s, background, or, upbringing, and, thus, any, attempts, to, connect, his, philosophy, with, either, topic, are, futile, sometime, between, age, 13, and, 15, 297, and, 295, bce, xunzi, traveled, to, the, north, eastern, state, of, qi, there, he, attended, the, jixia, academy, which, was, the, most, important, philosophical, center, in, ancient, china, established, by, king, xuan, at, the, academy, xunzi, would, have, learned, about, all, the, major, philosophical, schools, of, his, time, and, been, in, the, presence, of, scholars, such, as, zou, yan, tian, pian, and, chunyu, kun, xunzi, would, have, learned, the, art, of, shuo, a, formal, argument, of, persuasion, that, philosophical, authorities, of, the, time, used, to, advise, rulers, after, his, academy, study, xunzi, unsuccessfully, attempted, to, persuade, lord, mengchang, against, continuing, the, extreme, policies, of, qi, though, the, historicity, of, this, event, is, not, certain, after, the, exchange, which, is, later, recounted, in, his, writings, xunzi, likely, left, qi, between, 286, and, 284, bce, xunzi, traveled, to, the, state, of, chu, by, 283, bce, where, he, probably, became, acquainted, with, the, nascent, forms, of, the, fu, poetry, style, particularly, because, of, the, poet, s, qu, yuan, residency, there, xunzi, achieved, considerable, skill, in, the, art, and, his, now, lost, book, of, poems, was, well, regarded, for, many, centuries, chu, was, under, especially, frequent, attacks, from, the, qin, state, events, which, xunzi, would, later, recount, in, a, conversation, with, li, si, the, solidity, of, chu, decreased, so, rapidly, that, xunzi, left, around, 275, bce, returning, to, the, more, stable, qi, state, he, was, warmly, welcomed, back, in, qi, and, held, in, very, high, regard, as, an, intellectual, the, shiji, records, that, king, xiang, of, qi, had, xunzi, sacrifice, wine, three, times, a, task, that, was, reserved, for, the, most, respected, scholar, available, the, eminence, at, which, he, was, held, suggests, that, xunzi, became, the, head, of, the, jixia, academy, but, he, is, known, to, have, taught, there, regardless, it, was, at, this, time, that, xunzi, composed, much, of, his, most, important, philosophical, works, namely, the, chapters, of, honor, and, disgrace, of, kings, and, the, lords, protector, discourse, on, nature, discourse, on, music, and, man, s, nature, is, evil, in, his, time, xunzi, was, called, the, most, revered, of, teachers, zui, wei, laoshi, his, most, famous, pupils, were, han, fei, and, li, si, each, who, would, have, important, political, and, academic, careers, xunzi, s, association, with, li, si, the, future, chancellor, or, prime, minister, of, the, qin, dynasty, would, later, tarnish, his, reputation, other, students, of, his, included, fuqiu, bo, zhang, cang, and, mao, heng, all, of, whom, authored, important, editions, and, commentaries, on, the, confucian, classics, the, timeline, for, his, academy, teaching, is, unclear, though, he, seemed, to, have, considered, other, posts, after, being, slandered, he, left, qi, in, around, 265, bce, around, the, time, when, king, jian, succeeded, xiang, xunzi, notes, that, despite, qin, s, achievements, it, is, filled, with, trepidation, despite, its, complete, and, simultaneous, possession, of, all, these, numerous, attributes, if, one, weights, qin, by, the, standard, of, the, solid, achievements, of, true, kingship, then, the, vast, degree, to, which, it, fails, to, reach, the, ideal, is, manifest, why, is, that, it, is, that, it, is, dangerously, lacking, in, ru, scholars, xunzi, chp, 16, on, strengthening, the, state, 16, 6, xunzi, s, writings, suggest, that, after, leaving, qi, he, visited, qin, possibly, from, 265, bce, to, 260, bce, he, aimed, to, convert, the, state, s, leaders, to, follow, his, philosophy, of, leadership, a, task, which, proved, difficult, because, of, the, strong, hold, that, shang, yang, s, legalist, sentiments, had, there, in, a, conversation, with, the, qin, official, fan, sui, xunzi, praised, much, of, the, state, s, achievements, officials, and, governmental, organizations, still, xunzi, found, issues, with, the, state, primarily, its, lack, of, confucian, scholars, and, the, fear, it, inspires, which, xunzi, claimed, would, result, in, the, surrounding, states, uniting, up, against, xunzi, then, met, with, king, zhaoxiang, arguing, that, qin, s, lack, of, confucian, scholars, and, educational, encouragement, would, be, detrimental, to, the, state, s, future, the, king, was, unconvinced, by, xunzi, s, persuasion, and, did, not, offer, him, a, post, in, his, court, in, around, 260, bce, xunzi, returned, to, his, native, zhao, where, he, debated, military, affairs, with, lord, linwu, in, the, court, of, king, xiaocheng, of, zhao, he, remained, in, zhao, until, c, 255, bce, in, 240, bce, lord, chunshen, the, prime, minister, of, chu, invited, him, to, take, a, position, as, magistrate, of, lanling, which, he, initially, refused, and, then, accepted, however, lord, chunshen, was, assassinated, in, 238, bce, by, a, court, rival, and, xunzi, subsequently, lost, his, position, he, retired, remained, in, lanling, a, region, in, what, is, today, s, southern, shandong, province, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, was, buried, there, the, year, of, his, death, is, unknown, though, if, he, lived, to, see, the, ministership, of, his, student, li, si, as, recounted, he, would, have, lived, into, his, nineties, dying, shortly, after, 219, bce, the, best, known, and, most, cited, section, of, the, xunzi, is, chapter, 23, human, nature, is, evil, human, nature, known, as, xing, was, a, topic, which, confucius, commented, on, somewhat, ambiguously, leaving, much, room, for, later, philosophers, to, expand, upon, xunzi, does, not, appear, to, know, about, shang, yang, but, can, be, compared, with, him, while, shang, yang, believed, that, people, were, selfish, xunzi, believed, that, humanity, s, inborn, tendencies, were, evil, and, that, ethical, norms, had, been, invented, to, rectify, people, his, variety, of, confucianism, therefore, has, a, darker, more, pessimistic, flavor, than, the, optimistic, confucianism, of, mencius, who, tended, to, view, humans, as, innately, good, like, most, confucians, however, he, believed, that, people, could, be, refined, through, education, and, ritual, now, since, human, nature, is, evil, it, must, await, the, instructions, of, a, teacher, and, the, model, before, it, can, be, put, aright, and, it, must, obtain, ritual, principles, and, a, sense, of, moral, right, before, it, can, become, orderly, both, mencius, and, xunzi, believed, in, human, nature, and, both, believed, it, was, possible, to, become, better, but, some, people, refused, it, mencius, saw, xing, as, more, related, to, an, ideal, state, and, xunzi, saw, it, more, as, a, starting, state, even, though, mencius, had, already, died, when, the, book, was, written, the, chapter, is, written, like, a, conversation, between, the, two, philosophers, xunzi, s, ideas, about, becoming, a, good, person, were, more, complex, than, mencius, s, he, believed, that, people, needed, to, change, their, nature, not, just, give, up, on, it, some, people, thought, xunzi, s, ideas, were, strange, but, new, discoveries, suggest, that, it, might, have, actually, been, mencius, who, had, unusual, ideas, about, human, nature, the, chapter, is, called, human, nature, is, evil, but, that, s, not, the, whole, story, xunzi, thought, that, people, could, improve, themselves, by, learning, good, habits, and, manners, which, he, called, artifice, he, believed, that, people, needed, to, transform, their, nature, to, become, good, this, could, be, done, by, learning, from, a, teacher, and, following, rituals, and, morals, even, though, some, people, doubt, if, the, chapter, is, real, it, s, an, important, part, of, xunzi, s, philosophy, people, still, talk, about, it, today, and, think, about, the, differences, between, xunzi, and, mencius, s, ideas, about, human, nature, and, how, to, become, a, better, person, xunzi, only, stated, that, the, heart, can, observe, reason, that, is, it, can, distinguish, between, right, and, wrong, good, and, evil, but, it, is, not, the, source, of, value, so, where, does, the, standard, come, from, according, to, xunzi, s, theory, of, evil, human, nature, morality, will, ultimately, become, a, tool, of, external, value, used, to, maintain, social, stability, and, appeal, to, authoritarianism, mencius, theory, of, good, human, nature, on, the, other, hand, states, that, humans, are, inherently, good, and, we, have, an, internal, value, foundation, the, four, beginnings, music, is, discussed, throughout, the, xunzi, particularly, in, chapter, 20, the, discourse, on, music, yuelun, much, of, the, xunzi, s, sentiments, on, music, are, directed, towards, mozi, who, largely, disparaged, music, mozi, held, that, music, provides, no, basic, needs, and, is, a, waste, of, resources, and, money, xunzi, presents, a, comprehensive, argument, in, opposition, stating, that, certain, music, provides, joy, which, is, indeed, essential, to, human, wellbeing, music, and, joy, are, respectively, translated, as, yue, and, le, and, their, connection, in, xunzi, s, time, may, explain, why, both, words, share, the, same, chinese, character, xunzi, also, points, out, the, use, of, music, for, social, harmony, hence, when, music, is, performed, within, the, ancestral, temple, lord, and, subject, high, and, low, listen, to, the, music, together, and, are, united, in, feelings, of, reverence, when, music, is, played, in, the, private, quarters, of, the, home, father, and, son, elder, and, younger, brother, listen, to, it, together, and, are, united, in, feelings, of, close, kinship, when, it, is, played, in, village, meetings, or, clan, halls, old, and, young, listen, to, the, music, together, and, are, joined, in, obedience, many, commentators, have, noted, the, similarities, between, the, reasons, for, xunzi, s, promotion, of, music, and, those, of, ancient, greek, philosophers, ultimately, he, refused, to, admit, theories, of, state, and, administration, apart, from, ritual, and, self, cultivation, arguing, for, the, gentleman, rather, than, the, measurements, promoted, by, the, legalists, as, the, wellspring, of, objective, criterion, his, ideal, gentleman, junzi, king, and, government, aided, by, a, class, of, erudites, confucian, scholars, are, similar, to, that, of, mencius, but, without, the, tolerance, of, feudalism, since, he, rejected, hereditary, titles, and, believed, that, an, individual, s, status, in, the, social, hierarchy, should, be, determined, only, by, their, own, merit, books, and, chapters, journal, and, encyclopedia, articles, see, sung, 2018, and, knoblock, 1988, pp, 308, 322, for, extensive, bibliographies
