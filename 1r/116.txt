and, oil, paintings, degas, also, produced, bronze, sculptures, prints, and, drawings, degas, is, especially, identified, with, the, subject, of, dance, more, than, half, of, his, works, depict, dancers, although, degas, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, impressionism, he, rejected, the, term, preferring, to, be, called, a, realist, and, did, not, paint, outdoors, as, many, impressionists, did, degas, was, a, superb, draftsman, and, particularly, masterly, in, depicting, movement, as, can, be, seen, in, his, rendition, of, dancers, and, bathing, female, nudes, in, addition, to, ballet, dancers, and, bathing, women, degas, painted, racehorses, and, racing, jockeys, as, well, as, portraits, his, portraits, are, notable, for, their, psychological, complexity, and, their, portrayal, of, human, isolation, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, degas, wanted, to, be, a, history, painter, a, calling, for, which, he, was, well, prepared, by, his, rigorous, academic, training, and, close, study, of, classical, western, art, in, his, early, thirties, he, changed, course, and, by, bringing, the, traditional, methods, of, a, history, painter, to, bear, on, contemporary, subject, matter, he, became, a, classical, painter, of, modern, life, degas, was, born, in, paris, france, into, a, moderately, wealthy, family, he, was, the, oldest, of, five, children, of, c, lestine, musson, de, gas, a, creole, from, new, orleans, louisiana, and, augustin, de, gas, a, banker, his, maternal, grandfather, germain, musson, was, born, in, port, au, prince, haiti, of, french, descent, and, had, settled, in, new, orleans, in, 1810, degas, he, adopted, this, less, grandiose, spelling, of, his, family, name, when, he, became, an, adult, began, his, schooling, at, age, eleven, enrolling, in, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, his, mother, died, when, he, was, thirteen, and, the, main, influences, on, him, for, the, remainder, of, his, youth, were, his, father, and, several, unmarried, uncles, degas, began, to, paint, early, in, life, by, the, time, he, graduated, from, the, lyc, e, with, a, baccalaur, at, in, literature, in, 1853, at, age, 18, he, had, turned, a, room, in, his, home, into, an, artist, s, studio, upon, graduating, he, registered, as, a, copyist, in, the, louvre, museum, but, his, father, expected, him, to, go, to, law, school, degas, duly, enrolled, at, the, faculty, of, law, of, the, university, of, paris, in, november, 1853, but, applied, little, effort, to, his, studies, in, 1855, he, met, jean, auguste, dominique, ingres, whom, he, revered, and, whose, advice, he, never, forgot, draw, lines, young, man, and, still, more, lines, both, from, life, and, from, memory, and, you, will, become, a, good, artist, in, april, of, that, year, degas, was, admitted, to, the, cole, des, beaux, arts, he, studied, drawing, there, with, louis, lamothe, under, whose, guidance, he, flourished, following, the, style, of, ingres, in, july, 1856, degas, traveled, to, italy, where, he, would, remain, for, the, next, three, years, in, 1858, while, staying, with, his, aunt, s, family, in, naples, he, made, the, first, studies, for, his, early, masterpiece, the, bellelli, family, he, also, drew, and, painted, numerous, copies, of, works, by, michelangelo, raphael, titian, and, other, renaissance, artists, but, contrary, to, conventional, practice, he, usually, selected, from, an, altarpiece, a, detail, that, had, caught, his, attention, a, secondary, figure, or, a, head, which, he, treated, as, a, portrait, upon, his, return, to, france, in, 1859, degas, moved, into, a, paris, studio, large, enough, to, permit, him, to, begin, painting, the, bellelli, family, an, imposing, canvas, he, intended, for, exhibition, in, the, salon, although, it, remained, unfinished, until, 1867, he, also, began, work, on, several, history, paintings, alexander, and, bucephalus, and, the, daughter, of, jephthah, in, 1859, 60, s, miramis, building, babylon, in, 1860, and, young, spartans, exercising, around, 1860, in, 1861, degas, visited, his, childhood, friend, paul, valpin, on, in, m, nil, hubert, en, exmes, and, made, the, earliest, of, his, many, studies, of, horses, he, exhibited, at, the, salon, for, the, first, time, in, 1865, when, the, jury, accepted, his, painting, scene, of, war, in, the, middle, ages, which, attracted, little, attention, although, he, exhibited, annually, in, the, salon, during, the, next, five, years, he, submitted, no, more, history, paintings, and, his, scene, from, the, steeplechase, the, fallen, jockey, salon, of, 1866, signaled, his, growing, commitment, to, contemporary, subject, matter, the, change, in, his, art, was, influenced, primarily, by, the, example, of, douard, manet, whom, degas, had, met, in, 1864, while, both, were, copying, the, same, diego, vel, zquez, portrait, in, the, louvre, according, to, a, story, that, may, be, apocryphal, upon, the, outbreak, of, the, franco, prussian, war, in, 1870, degas, enlisted, in, the, national, guard, where, his, partaking, in, the, defense, of, paris, left, him, little, time, for, painting, during, rifle, training, his, eyesight, was, found, to, be, defective, and, for, the, rest, of, his, life, his, eye, problems, were, a, constant, worry, to, him, after, the, war, degas, began, in, 1872, an, extended, stay, in, new, orleans, where, his, brother, ren, and, a, number, of, other, relatives, lived, staying, at, the, home, of, his, creole, uncle, michel, musson, on, esplanade, avenue, degas, produced, a, number, of, works, many, depicting, family, members, one, of, degas, s, new, orleans, works, a, cotton, office, in, new, orleans, garnered, favorable, attention, back, in, france, and, was, his, only, work, purchased, by, a, museum, the, pau, during, his, lifetime, degas, returned, to, paris, in, 1873, and, his, father, died, the, following, year, whereupon, degas, learned, that, his, brother, ren, had, amassed, enormous, business, debts, to, preserve, his, family, s, reputation, degas, sold, his, house, and, an, art, collection, he, had, inherited, and, used, the, money, to, pay, off, his, brother, s, debts, dependent, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, on, sales, of, his, artwork, for, income, he, produced, much, of, his, greatest, work, during, the, decade, beginning, in, 1874, disenchanted, by, now, with, the, salon, he, instead, joined, a, group, of, young, artists, who, were, organizing, an, independent, exhibiting, society, the, group, soon, became, known, as, the, impressionists, between, 1874, and, 1886, they, mounted, eight, art, shows, known, as, the, impressionist, exhibitions, degas, took, a, leading, role, in, organizing, the, exhibitions, and, showed, his, work, in, all, but, one, of, them, despite, his, persistent, conflicts, with, others, in, the, group, he, had, little, in, common, with, monet, and, the, other, landscape, painters, in, the, group, whom, he, mocked, for, painting, outdoors, conservative, in, his, social, attitudes, he, abhorred, the, scandal, created, by, the, exhibitions, as, well, as, the, publicity, and, advertising, that, his, colleagues, sought, he, also, deeply, disliked, being, associated, with, the, term, impressionist, which, the, press, had, coined, and, popularized, and, insisted, on, including, non, impressionist, artists, such, as, jean, louis, forain, and, jean, fran, ois, raffa, lli, in, the, group, s, exhibitions, the, resulting, rancor, within, the, group, contributed, to, its, disbanding, in, 1886, as, his, financial, situation, improved, through, sales, of, his, own, work, he, was, able, to, indulge, his, passion, for, collecting, works, by, artists, he, admired, old, masters, such, as, el, greco, and, such, contemporaries, as, manet, cassatt, pissarro, c, zanne, gauguin, van, gogh, and, douard, brandon, three, artists, he, idolized, ingres, delacroix, and, daumier, were, especially, well, represented, in, his, collection, in, the, late, 1880s, degas, also, developed, a, passion, for, photography, he, photographed, many, of, his, friends, often, by, lamplight, as, in, his, double, portrait, of, renoir, and, mallarm, other, photographs, depicting, dancers, and, nudes, were, used, for, reference, in, some, of, degas, s, drawings, and, paintings, as, the, years, passed, degas, became, isolated, due, in, part, to, his, belief, that, a, painter, could, have, no, personal, life, the, dreyfus, affair, controversy, brought, his, anti, semitic, leanings, to, the, fore, and, he, broke, with, all, his, jewish, friends, his, argumentative, nature, was, deplored, by, renoir, who, said, of, him, what, a, creature, he, was, that, degas, all, his, friends, had, to, leave, him, i, was, one, of, the, last, to, go, but, even, i, couldn, t, stay, till, the, end, after, 1890, degas, s, eyesight, which, had, long, troubled, him, deteriorated, further, although, he, is, known, to, have, been, working, in, pastel, as, late, as, the, end, of, 1907, and, is, believed, to, have, continued, making, sculptures, as, late, as, 1910, he, apparently, ceased, working, in, 1912, when, the, impending, demolition, of, his, longtime, residence, on, the, rue, victor, mass, forced, him, to, move, to, quarters, on, the, boulevard, de, clichy, he, never, married, and, spent, the, last, years, of, his, life, nearly, blind, restlessly, wandering, the, streets, of, paris, before, dying, in, september, 1917, degas, is, often, identified, as, an, impressionist, an, understandable, but, insufficient, description, impressionism, originated, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, and, grew, in, part, from, the, realism, of, painters, such, as, courbet, and, corot, the, impressionists, painted, the, realities, of, the, world, around, them, using, bright, dazzling, colors, concentrating, primarily, on, the, effects, of, light, and, hoping, to, infuse, their, scenes, with, immediacy, they, wanted, to, express, their, visual, experience, in, that, exact, moment, technically, degas, differs, from, the, impressionists, in, that, he, continually, belittled, their, practice, of, painting, en, plein, air, you, know, what, i, think, of, people, who, work, out, in, the, open, if, i, were, the, government, i, would, have, a, special, brigade, of, gendarmes, to, keep, an, eye, on, artists, who, paint, landscapes, from, nature, oh, i, don, t, mean, to, kill, anyone, just, a, little, dose, of, bird, shot, now, and, then, as, a, warning, he, was, often, as, anti, impressionist, as, the, critics, who, reviewed, the, shows, according, to, art, historian, carol, armstrong, as, degas, himself, explained, no, art, was, ever, less, spontaneous, than, mine, what, i, do, is, the, result, of, reflection, and, of, the, study, of, the, great, masters, of, inspiration, spontaneity, temperament, i, know, nothing, nonetheless, he, is, described, more, accurately, as, an, impressionist, than, as, a, member, of, any, other, movement, his, scenes, of, parisian, life, his, off, center, compositions, his, experiments, with, color, and, form, and, his, friendship, with, several, key, impressionist, artists, most, notably, mary, cassatt, and, manet, all, relate, him, intimately, to, the, impressionist, movement, degas, s, style, reflects, his, deep, respect, for, the, old, masters, he, was, an, enthusiastic, copyist, well, into, middle, age, and, his, great, admiration, for, ingres, and, delacroix, he, was, also, a, collector, of, japanese, prints, whose, compositional, principles, influenced, his, work, as, did, the, vigorous, realism, of, popular, illustrators, such, as, daumier, and, gavarni, although, famous, for, horses, and, dancers, degas, began, with, conventional, historical, paintings, such, as, the, daughter, of, jephthah, c, 1859, 61, and, young, spartans, exercising, c, 1860, 62, in, which, his, gradual, progress, toward, a, less, idealized, treatment, of, the, figure, is, already, apparent, during, his, early, career, degas, also, painted, portraits, of, individuals, and, groups, an, example, of, the, latter, is, the, bellelli, family, c, 1858, 67, an, ambitious, and, psychologically, poignant, portrayal, of, his, aunt, her, husband, and, their, children, in, this, painting, as, in, young, spartans, exercising, and, many, later, works, degas, was, drawn, to, the, tensions, present, between, men, and, women, in, his, early, paintings, degas, already, evidenced, the, mature, style, that, he, would, later, develop, more, fully, by, cropping, subjects, awkwardly, and, by, choosing, unusual, viewpoints, by, the, late, 1860s, degas, had, shifted, from, his, initial, forays, into, history, painting, to, an, original, observation, of, contemporary, life, racecourse, scenes, provided, an, opportunity, to, depict, horses, and, their, riders, in, a, modern, context, he, began, to, paint, women, at, work, milliners, and, laundresses, his, milliner, series, is, interpreted, as, artistic, self, reflection, mlle, fiocre, in, the, ballet, la, source, exhibited, in, the, salon, of, 1868, was, his, first, major, work, to, introduce, a, subject, with, which, he, would, become, especially, identified, dancers, in, many, subsequent, paintings, dancers, were, shown, backstage, or, in, rehearsal, emphasizing, their, status, as, professionals, doing, a, job, from, 1870, degas, increasingly, painted, ballet, subjects, partly, because, they, sold, well, and, provided, him, with, needed, income, after, his, brother, s, debts, had, left, the, family, bankrupt, degas, began, to, paint, caf, life, as, well, in, works, such, as, l, absinthe, and, singer, with, a, glove, his, paintings, often, hinted, at, narrative, content, in, a, way, that, was, highly, ambiguous, for, example, interior, which, has, also, been, called, the, rape, has, presented, a, conundrum, to, art, historians, in, search, of, a, literary, source, th, r, se, raquin, has, been, suggested, but, it, may, be, a, depiction, of, prostitution, as, his, subject, matter, changed, so, too, did, degas, s, technique, the, dark, palette, that, bore, the, influence, of, dutch, painting, gave, way, to, the, use, of, vivid, colors, and, bold, brushstrokes, paintings, such, as, place, de, la, concorde, read, as, snapshots, freezing, moments, of, time, to, portray, them, accurately, imparting, a, sense, of, movement, the, lack, of, color, in, the, 1874, ballet, rehearsal, on, stage, and, the, 1876, the, ballet, instructor, can, be, said, to, link, with, his, interest, in, the, new, technique, of, photography, the, changes, to, his, palette, brushwork, and, sense, of, composition, all, evidence, the, influence, that, both, the, impressionist, movement, and, modern, photography, with, its, spontaneous, images, and, off, kilter, angles, had, on, his, work, blurring, the, distinction, between, portraiture, and, genre, pieces, he, painted, his, bassoonist, friend, d, sir, dihau, in, the, orchestra, of, the, opera, c, 1870, as, one, of, fourteen, musicians, in, an, orchestra, pit, viewed, as, though, by, a, member, of, the, audience, above, the, musicians, can, be, seen, only, the, legs, and, tutus, of, the, dancers, onstage, their, figures, cropped, by, the, edge, of, the, painting, art, historian, charles, stuckey, has, compared, the, viewpoint, to, that, of, a, distracted, spectator, at, a, ballet, and, says, that, it, is, degas, fascination, with, the, depiction, of, movement, including, the, movement, of, a, spectator, s, eyes, as, during, a, random, glance, that, is, properly, speaking, impressionist, degas, s, mature, style, is, distinguished, by, conspicuously, unfinished, passages, even, in, otherwise, tightly, rendered, paintings, he, frequently, blamed, his, eye, troubles, for, his, inability, to, finish, an, explanation, that, met, with, some, skepticism, from, colleagues, and, collectors, who, reasoned, as, stuckey, explains, that, his, pictures, could, hardly, have, been, executed, by, anyone, with, inadequate, vision, the, artist, provided, another, clue, when, he, described, his, predilection, to, begin, a, hundred, things, and, not, finish, one, of, them, and, was, in, any, case, notoriously, reluctant, to, consider, a, painting, complete, his, interest, in, portraiture, led, degas, to, study, carefully, the, ways, in, which, a, person, s, social, stature, or, form, of, employment, may, be, revealed, by, their, physiognomy, posture, dress, and, other, attributes, in, his, 1879, portraits, at, the, stock, exchange, he, portrayed, a, group, of, jewish, businessmen, with, a, hint, of, anti, semitism, in, 1881, he, exhibited, two, pastels, criminal, physiognomies, that, depicted, juvenile, gang, members, recently, convicted, of, murder, in, the, abadie, affair, degas, had, attended, their, trial, with, sketchbook, in, hand, and, his, numerous, drawings, of, the, defendants, reveal, his, interest, in, the, atavistic, features, thought, by, some, 19th, century, scientists, to, be, evidence, of, innate, criminality, in, his, paintings, of, dancers, and, laundresses, he, reveals, their, occupations, not, only, by, their, dress, and, activities, but, also, by, their, body, type, his, ballerinas, exhibit, an, athletic, physicality, while, his, laundresses, are, heavy, and, solid, by, the, later, 1870s, degas, had, mastered, not, only, the, traditional, medium, of, oil, on, canvas, but, pastel, as, well, the, dry, medium, which, he, applied, in, complex, layers, and, textures, enabled, him, more, easily, to, reconcile, his, facility, for, line, with, a, growing, interest, in, expressive, color, in, the, mid, 1870s, he, also, returned, to, the, medium, of, etching, which, he, had, neglected, for, ten, years, at, first, he, was, guided, in, this, by, his, old, friend, ludovic, napol, on, lepic, himself, an, innovator, in, its, use, and, began, experimenting, with, lithography, and, monotype, he, produced, some, 300, monotypes, over, two, periods, from, the, mid, 1870s, to, the, mid, 1880s, and, again, in, the, early, 1890s, he, was, especially, fascinated, by, the, effects, produced, by, monotype, and, frequently, reworked, the, printed, images, with, pastel, by, 1880, sculpture, had, become, one, more, strand, to, degas, s, continuing, endeavor, to, explore, different, media, although, the, artist, displayed, only, one, sculpture, publicly, during, his, lifetime, these, changes, in, media, engendered, the, paintings, that, degas, would, produce, in, later, life, degas, began, to, draw, and, paint, women, drying, themselves, with, towels, combing, their, hair, and, bathing, see, after, the, bath, woman, drying, herself, the, strokes, that, model, the, form, are, scribbled, more, freely, than, before, backgrounds, are, simplified, the, meticulous, naturalism, of, his, youth, gave, way, to, an, increasing, abstraction, of, form, except, for, his, characteristically, brilliant, draftsmanship, and, obsession, with, the, figure, the, pictures, created, in, this, late, period, of, his, life, bear, little, superficial, resemblance, to, his, early, paintings, in, point, of, fact, these, paintings, created, late, in, his, life, and, after, the, heyday, of, the, impressionist, movement, most, vividly, use, the, coloristic, techniques, of, impressionism, for, all, the, stylistic, evolution, certain, features, of, degas, s, work, remained, the, same, throughout, his, life, he, always, painted, indoors, preferring, to, work, in, his, studio, from, memory, photographs, or, live, models, the, figure, remained, his, primary, subject, his, few, landscapes, were, produced, from, memory, or, imagination, it, was, not, unusual, for, him, to, repeat, a, subject, many, times, varying, the, composition, or, treatment, he, was, a, deliberative, artist, whose, works, as, andrew, forge, has, written, were, prepared, calculated, practiced, developed, in, stages, they, were, made, up, of, parts, the, adjustment, of, each, part, to, the, whole, their, linear, arrangement, was, the, occasion, for, infinite, reflection, and, experiment, degas, explained, in, art, nothing, should, look, like, chance, not, even, movement, he, was, most, interested, in, the, presentation, of, his, paintings, patronizing, pierre, cluzel, as, a, framer, and, disliking, ornate, styles, of, the, day, often, insisting, on, his, choices, for, the, framing, as, a, condition, of, purchase, degas, s, only, showing, of, sculpture, during, his, life, took, place, in, 1881, when, he, exhibited, the, little, dancer, of, fourteen, years, a, nearly, life, size, wax, figure, with, real, hair, and, dressed, in, a, cloth, tutu, it, provoked, a, strong, reaction, from, critics, most, of, whom, found, its, realism, extraordinary, but, denounced, the, dancer, as, ugly, in, a, review, j, k, huysmans, wrote, the, terrible, reality, of, this, statuette, evidently, produces, uneasiness, in, the, spectators, all, their, notions, about, sculpture, about, those, cold, inanimate, whitenesses, are, here, overturned, the, fact, is, that, with, his, first, attempt, monsieur, degas, has, revolutionized, the, traditions, of, sculpture, as, he, has, long, since, shaken, the, conventions, of, painting, degas, created, a, substantial, number, of, other, sculptures, during, a, span, of, four, decades, but, they, remained, unseen, by, the, public, until, a, posthumous, exhibition, in, 1918, neither, the, little, dancer, of, fourteen, years, nor, any, of, degas, s, other, sculptures, were, cast, in, bronze, during, the, artist, s, lifetime, degas, scholars, have, agreed, that, the, sculptures, were, not, created, as, aids, to, painting, although, the, artist, habitually, explored, ways, of, linking, graphic, art, and, oil, painting, drawing, and, pastel, sculpture, and, photography, degas, assigned, the, same, significance, to, sculpture, as, to, drawing, drawing, is, a, way, of, thinking, modelling, another, after, degas, s, death, his, heirs, found, in, his, studio, 150, wax, sculptures, many, in, disrepair, they, consulted, foundry, owner, adrien, h, brard, who, concluded, that, 74, of, the, waxes, could, be, cast, in, bronze, it, is, assumed, that, except, for, the, little, dancer, aged, fourteen, all, degas, bronzes, worldwide, are, cast, from, surmoulages, i, e, cast, from, bronze, masters, a, surmoulage, bronze, is, a, bit, smaller, and, shows, less, surface, detail, than, its, original, bronze, mold, the, h, brard, foundry, cast, the, bronzes, from, 1919, until, 1936, and, closed, down, in, 1937, shortly, before, h, brard, s, death, in, 2004, a, little, known, group, of, 73, plaster, casts, more, or, less, closely, resembling, degas, s, original, wax, sculptures, was, presented, as, having, been, discovered, among, the, materials, bought, by, the, airaindor, foundry, later, known, as, airaindor, valsuani, from, h, brard, s, descendants, bronzes, cast, from, these, plasters, were, issued, between, 2004, and, 2016, by, airaindor, valsuani, in, editions, inconsistently, marked, and, thus, of, unknown, size, there, has, been, substantial, controversy, concerning, the, authenticity, of, these, plasters, as, well, as, the, circumstances, and, date, of, their, creation, as, proposed, by, their, promoters, while, several, museum, and, academic, professionals, accept, them, as, presented, most, of, the, recognized, degas, scholars, have, declined, to, comment, degas, who, believed, that, the, artist, must, live, alone, and, his, private, life, must, remain, unknown, lived, an, outwardly, uneventful, life, in, company, he, was, known, for, his, wit, which, could, often, be, cruel, he, was, characterized, as, an, old, curmudgeon, by, the, novelist, george, moore, and, he, deliberately, cultivated, his, reputation, as, a, misanthropic, bachelor, in, the, 1870s, degas, gravitated, towards, the, republican, circles, of, l, on, gambetta, however, his, republicanism, did, not, come, untainted, and, signs, of, the, prejudice, and, irritability, which, would, overtake, him, in, old, age, were, occasionally, manifested, he, fired, a, model, upon, learning, she, was, protestant, although, degas, painted, a, number, of, jewish, subjects, from, 1865, to, 1870, his, 1879, painting, portraits, at, the, stock, exchange, may, be, a, watershed, in, his, political, opinions, the, painting, is, a, portrait, of, the, jewish, banker, ernest, may, who, may, have, commissioned, the, work, and, was, its, first, owner, and, is, widely, regarded, as, anti, semitic, by, modern, experts, the, facial, features, of, the, banker, in, profile, have, been, directly, compared, to, those, in, the, anti, semitic, cartoons, rampant, in, paris, at, the, time, while, those, of, the, background, characters, have, drawn, comparisons, to, degas, earlier, work, criminal, physiognomies, the, dreyfus, affair, which, divided, opinion, in, paris, from, the, 1890s, to, the, early, 1900s, intensified, his, anti, semitism, by, the, mid, 1890s, he, had, broken, off, relations, with, all, of, his, jewish, friends, publicly, disavowed, his, previous, friendships, with, jewish, artists, and, refused, to, use, models, who, he, believed, might, be, jewish, he, remained, an, outspoken, anti, semite, and, member, of, the, anti, semitic, anti, dreyfusards, until, his, death, during, his, life, public, reception, of, degas, s, work, ranged, from, admiration, to, contempt, as, a, promising, artist, in, the, conventional, mode, degas, had, a, number, of, paintings, accepted, in, the, salon, between, 1865, and, 1870, these, works, received, praise, from, pierre, puvis, de, chavannes, and, the, critic, jules, antoine, castagnary, he, soon, joined, forces, with, the, impressionists, however, and, rejected, the, rigid, rules, and, judgments, of, the, salon, degas, s, work, was, controversial, but, was, generally, admired, for, its, draftsmanship, his, la, petite, danseuse, de, quatorze, ans, or, little, dancer, of, fourteen, years, which, he, displayed, at, the, sixth, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1881, was, probably, his, most, controversial, piece, some, critics, decried, what, they, thought, its, appalling, ugliness, while, others, saw, in, it, a, blossoming, in, part, degas, originality, consisted, in, disregarding, the, smooth, full, surfaces, and, contours, of, classical, sculpture, in, garnishing, his, little, statue, with, real, hair, and, clothing, made, to, scale, like, the, accoutrements, for, a, doll, these, relatively, real, additions, heightened, the, illusion, but, they, also, posed, searching, questions, such, as, what, can, be, referred, to, as, real, when, art, is, concerned, the, suite, of, pastels, depicting, nudes, that, degas, exhibited, in, the, eighth, impressionist, exhibition, in, 1886, produced, the, most, concentrated, body, of, critical, writing, on, the, artist, during, his, lifetime, the, overall, reaction, was, positive, and, laudatory, recognized, as, an, important, artist, in, his, lifetime, degas, is, now, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, impressionism, though, his, work, crossed, many, stylistic, boundaries, his, involvement, with, the, other, major, figures, of, impressionism, and, their, exhibitions, his, dynamic, paintings, and, sketches, of, everyday, life, and, activities, and, his, bold, color, experiments, served, to, finally, tie, him, to, the, impressionist, movement, as, one, of, its, greatest, artists, although, degas, had, no, formal, pupils, he, greatly, influenced, several, important, painters, most, notably, jean, louis, forain, mary, cassatt, and, walter, sickert, his, greatest, admirer, may, have, been, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, degas, s, paintings, pastels, drawings, and, sculptures, are, on, prominent, display, in, many, museums, and, have, been, the, subject, of, many, museum, exhibitions, and, retrospectives, recent, exhibitions, include, degas, drawings, and, sketchbooks, the, morgan, library, 2010, picasso, looks, at, degas, museu, picasso, de, barcelona, 2010, degas, and, the, nude,

cassatt, to, exhibit, in, the, third, impressionist, exhibition, he, had, admired, a, portrait, ida, she, exhibited, in, the, salon, of, 1874, and, the, two, formed, a, friendship, they, had, much, in, common, they, shared, similar, tastes, in, art, and, literature, came, from, affluent, backgrounds, had, studied, painting, in, italy, and, both, were, independent, never, marrying, both, regarded, themselves, as, figure, painters, and, the, art, historian, george, shackelford, suggests, they, were, influenced, by, the, art, critic, louis, edmond, duranty, s, appeal, in, his, pamphlet, the, new, painting, for, a, revitalization, in, figure, painting, let, us, take, leave, of, the, stylized, human, body, which, is, treated, like, a, vase, what, we, need, is, the, characteristic, modern, person, in, his, clothes, in, the, midst, of, his, social, surroundings, at, home, or, out, in, the, street, after, cassatt, s, parents, and, sister, lydia, joined, cassatt, in, paris, in, 1877, degas, cassatt, and, lydia, were, often, to, be, seen, at, the, louvre, studying, artworks, together, degas, produced, two, prints, notable, for, their, technical, innovation, depicting, cassatt, at, the, louvre, looking, at, artworks, while, lydia, reads, a, guidebook, these, were, destined, for, a, prints, journal, planned, by, degas, together, with, camille, pissarro, and, others, which, never, came, to, fruition, cassatt, frequently, posed, for, degas, notably, for, his, millinery, series, trying, on, hats, degas, introduced, cassatt, to, pastel, and, engraving, while, for, her, part, cassatt, was, instrumental, in, helping, degas, sell, his, paintings, and, promoting, his, reputation, in, the, united, states, cassatt, and, degas, worked, most, closely, together, in, the, fall, and, winter, of, 1879, 80, when, cassatt, was, mastering, her, printmaking, technique, degas, owned, a, small, printing, press, and, by, day, she, worked, at, his, studio, using, his, tools, and, press, however, in, april, 1880, degas, abruptly, withdrew, from, the, prints, journal, they, had, been, collaborating, on, and, without, his, support, the, project, folded, although, they, continued, to, visit, each, other, until, degas, death, in, 1917, she, never, again, worked, with, him, as, closely, as, she, had, over, the, prints, journal, around, 1884, degas, made, a, portrait, in, oils, of, cassatt, mary, cassatt, seated, holding, cards, stephanie, strasnick, suggests, that, the, cards, are, probably, cartes, de, visite, used, by, artists, and, dealers, at, the, time, to, document, their, work, cassatt, thought, it, represented, her, as, a, repugnant, person, and, later, sold, it, writing, to, her, dealer, paul, durand, ruel, in, 1912, or, 1913, that, i, would, not, want, it, known, that, i, posed, for, it, degas, was, forthright, in, his, views, as, was, cassatt, they, clashed, over, the, dreyfus, affair, cassatt, later, expressed, satisfaction, at, the, irony, of, lousine, havermeyer, s, 1915, joint, exhibition, of, hers, and, degas, work, being, held, in, aid, of, women, s, suffrage, equally, capable, of, affectionately, repeating, degas,
