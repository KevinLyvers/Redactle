marcus, porcius, cato, k, e, t, o, kay, toe, 234, 149, bc, also, known, as, cato, the, censor, latin, censorius, the, elder, and, the, wise, was, a, roman, soldier, senator, and, historian, known, for, his, conservatism, and, opposition, to, hellenization, he, was, the, first, to, write, history, in, latin, with, his, origines, a, now, fragmentary, work, on, the, history, of, rome, his, work, de, agri, cultura, a, rambling, work, on, agriculture, farming, rituals, and, recipes, is, the, oldest, extant, prose, written, in, the, latin, language, his, epithet, elder, distinguishes, him, from, his, great, grandson, cato, the, younger, who, opposed, julius, caesar, he, came, from, an, ancient, plebeian, family, who, were, noted, for, their, military, service, like, his, forefathers, cato, was, devoted, to, agriculture, when, not, serving, in, the, army, having, attracted, the, attention, of, lucius, valerius, flaccus, he, was, brought, to, rome, he, was, successively, military, tribune, 214, bc, quaestor, 204, aedile, 199, praetor, 198, consul, 195, together, with, flaccus, and, censor, 184, as, praetor, he, expelled, usurers, from, sardinia, as, censor, he, tried, to, save, rome, s, ancestral, customs, and, combat, hellenistic, influences, cato, the, elder, was, born, in, the, municipal, town, of, tusculum, like, some, generations, of, his, ancestors, his, father, had, earned, a, reputation, as, a, brave, soldier, and, his, great, grandfather, had, received, a, reward, from, the, state, for, having, had, five, horses, killed, under, him, in, battle, however, the, tusculan, porcii, had, never, obtained, the, privileges, of, the, roman, magistracy, cato, the, elder, their, famous, descendant, at, the, beginning, of, his, career, in, rome, was, regarded, as, a, novus, homo, new, man, and, the, feeling, of, his, unsatisfactory, position, working, along, with, the, belief, of, his, inherent, superiority, aggravated, and, drove, his, ambition, early, in, life, he, so, far, exceeded, the, previous, deeds, of, his, predecessors, that, he, is, frequently, spoken, of, not, only, as, the, leader, but, as, the, founder, of, the, porcia, gens, his, ancestors, for, three, generations, had, been, named, marcus, porcius, and, it, was, said, by, plutarch, that, at, first, he, was, known, by, the, additional, cognomen, priscus, but, was, afterwards, called, cato, a, word, from, latin, catus, indicating, common, sense, that, is, the, result, of, natural, wisdom, combined, with, experience, priscus, like, major, may, have, been, merely, an, epithet, used, to, distinguish, him, from, the, later, cato, the, younger, there, is, no, precise, information, as, to, when, he, first, received, the, title, of, cato, which, may, have, been, given, in, childhood, as, a, symbol, of, distinction, the, qualities, implied, in, the, word, cato, were, acknowledged, by, the, plainer, and, less, outdated, title, of, sapiens, by, which, he, was, so, well, known, in, his, old, age, that, cicero, says, it, became, his, virtual, cognomen, from, the, number, and, eloquence, of, his, speeches, he, was, a, gifted, orator, but, cato, the, censor, cato, censorius, and, cato, the, elder, are, now, his, most, common, as, well, as, his, most, characteristic, names, since, he, carried, out, the, office, of, censor, with, extraordinary, standing, and, was, the, only, cato, who, ever, held, it, the, date, of, cato, s, birth, has, to, be, deduced, from, conflicting, reports, of, his, age, at, the, time, of, his, death, which, is, known, to, have, happened, in, 149, bc, according, to, the, chronology, of, cicero, cato, was, born, in, 234, bc, in, the, year, before, the, first, consulship, of, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, and, died, at, the, age, of, 85, in, the, consulship, of, lucius, marcius, censorinus, and, manius, manilius, pliny, agrees, with, cicero, other, authors, exaggerate, the, age, of, cato, according, to, valerius, maximus, he, survived, his, 86th, year, according, to, livy, and, plutarch, he, was, 90, years, old, when, he, died, these, exaggerated, ages, however, are, inconsistent, with, a, statement, of, cato, himself, that, is, recorded, by, plutarch, when, cato, was, very, young, after, his, father, s, death, he, inherited, a, small, property, in, sabine, territory, at, a, distance, from, his, native, town, there, he, spent, most, of, his, childhood, overseeing, the, operations, of, the, farm, learning, business, and, the, rural, economy, near, this, land, was, a, small, hut, owned, by, manius, curius, dentatus, whose, military, feats, and, rigidly, simple, character, were, remembered, and, admired, in, the, neighborhood, cato, was, inspired, to, imitate, that, character, hoping, to, match, the, glory, of, dentatus, soon, an, opportunity, came, for, a, military, campaign, in, 218, bc, hannibal, barca, attacked, one, of, rome, s, allies, starting, the, second, punic, war, experts, express, some, disagreement, about, cato, s, early, military, life, in, 214, he, served, at, capua, and, the, historian, wilhelm, drumann, imagines, that, already, at, the, age, of, 20, he, was, a, military, tribune, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, had, the, command, in, this, area, campania, during, the, year, of, his, fourth, consulship, at, the, siege, of, tarentum, in, 209, cato, was, again, at, the, side, of, fabius, two, years, later, cato, was, one, of, the, men, who, went, with, the, consul, claudius, nero, on, his, northern, march, from, lucania, to, check, the, progress, of, hasdrubal, barca, it, is, recorded, that, the, services, of, cato, contributed, to, the, decisive, and, important, victory, of, sena, at, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, where, hasdrubal, was, slain, cato, later, gave, several, vehement, speeches, which, he, often, ended, by, saying, carthago, delenda, est, or, carthage, must, be, destroyed, he, encouraged, the, romans, to, attack, carthage, in, the, pauses, between, campaigns, cato, returned, to, his, sabine, farm, where, he, dressed, simply, working, and, behaving, like, his, laborers, young, as, he, was, the, neighboring, farmers, liked, his, tough, mode, of, living, enjoyed, his, old, fashioned, and, concise, proverbs, and, had, a, high, regard, for, his, abilities, his, own, active, personality, made, him, willing, and, eager, to, make, himself, available, in, the, service, of, his, neighbors, he, was, selected, to, act, sometimes, as, an, arbitrator, of, disputes, and, sometimes, as, a, supporter, in, local, causes, which, were, probably, tried, in, front, of, recuperatores, the, judges, for, causes, of, great, public, interest, consequently, he, was, enabled, to, strengthen, by, practice, his, oratorical, abilities, to, gain, self, confidence, to, observe, the, manners, of, men, to, analyze, the, diversity, of, human, nature, to, apply, the, rules, of, law, and, to, practically, investigate, the, principles, of, justice, in, the, area, surrounding, cato, s, sabine, farm, were, the, lands, of, lucius, valerius, flaccus, a, young, nobleman, of, significant, influence, and, high, patrician, family, flaccus, could, not, help, remarking, on, cato, s, energy, his, military, talent, his, eloquence, his, frugal, and, simple, life, and, his, traditional, principles, flaccus, himself, was, a, member, of, that, purist, patrician, faction, which, displayed, its, adherence, to, the, stricter, virtues, of, the, roman, character, within, roman, society, a, transition, was, in, progress, from, samnite, rusticity, to, grecian, civilization, and, oriental, luxuriance, the, chief, magistracies, of, the, state, had, become, almost, hereditary, for, a, few, wealthy, and, upper, class, families, they, were, popular, by, acts, of, generosity, and, charming, manners, and, they, collected, material, wealth, from, their, clients, and, followers, as, well, as, intellectual, prowess, provided, by, their, education, taste, in, the, fine, arts, and, knowledge, of, literature, nonetheless, the, less, fortunate, nobles, envious, of, this, exclusive, oligarchy, and, critical, of, the, decadence, and, luxury, formed, a, party, with, a, more, conservative, and, ascetic, ideology, in, their, eyes, rusticity, and, austerity, were, the, marks, of, sabine, character, and, of, the, old, roman, inflexible, integrity, and, love, of, order, marcus, claudius, marcellus, scipio, africanus, and, his, family, and, titus, quinctius, flamininus, may, be, taken, as, representative, of, the, new, culture, cato, s, friends, fabius, and, flaccus, were, the, leading, men, in, the, faction, defending, the, old, plainness, flaccus, was, a, perceptive, politician, who, looked, for, young, and, emergent, men, to, support, him, he, had, observed, cato, s, martial, spirit, and, heard, his, eloquent, tongue, he, knew, how, much, courage, and, persuasiveness, were, valued, at, rome, he, also, knew, that, distinction, achieved, on, the, battlefield, opened, the, way, to, achievements, in, the, higher, civil, offices, flaccus, knew, too, that, for, a, stranger, like, cato, the, only, way, to, the, magisterial, honours, was, success, in, the, roman, forum, for, that, reason, he, suggested, to, cato, that, he, shift, his, ambition, to, the, field, of, roman, politics, the, advice, was, followed, invited, to, the, townhouse, of, flaccus, and, ratified, by, his, support, cato, began, to, distinguish, himself, in, the, forum, and, became, a, candidate, for, assuming, a, post, in, the, magistracy, in, 205, bc, cato, was, appointed, quaestor, and, in, the, next, year, 204, he, entered, upon, the, duties, of, his, place, of, work, following, publius, cornelius, scipio, africanus, major, to, sicily, when, scipio, after, much, opposition, obtained, from, the, senate, permission, to, transport, armed, forces, from, sicily, to, africa, cato, and, gaius, laelius, were, appointed, to, escort, the, baggage, ships, yet, there, proved, not, to, be, the, friendliness, of, cooperation, between, cato, and, scipio, which, ought, to, have, existed, between, a, quaestor, and, his, proconsul, fabius, had, opposed, the, permission, given, to, scipio, to, carry, the, attack, to, the, enemy, s, home, and, cato, whose, appointment, was, intended, to, monitor, scipio, s, behavior, adopted, the, views, of, his, friend, plutarch, reports, that, the, lenient, discipline, of, the, troops, under, scipio, s, command, and, the, exaggerated, expenses, incurred, by, the, general, provoked, cato, s, protests, such, that, scipio, immediately, afterward, replied, angrily, saying, he, would, give, an, account, of, victories, not, of, money, cato, left, his, place, of, duty, after, the, dispute, with, scipio, about, the, latter, s, alleged, extravagance, and, returning, to, rome, condemned, the, uneconomical, activities, of, his, general, to, the, senate, plutarch, went, on, to, say, that, at, the, joint, request, of, cato, and, fabius, a, commission, of, tribunes, was, sent, to, sicily, to, examine, scipio, s, activity, upon, their, review, of, his, extensive, and, careful, arrangements, for, the, transport, of, the, troops, they, determined, he, was, not, guilty, of, cato, s, charges, plutarch, s, version, which, seemed, to, attribute, to, cato, the, wrongdoing, of, quitting, his, post, before, his, time, is, barely, consistent, with, livy, s, narrative, if, livy, is, correct, the, commission, was, sent, because, of, the, complaints, of, the, inhabitants, of, locri, who, had, been, harshly, oppressed, by, quintus, pleminius, scipio, s, legate, livy, says, nothing, of, cato, s, interference, in, this, matter, but, mentions, the, bitterness, with, which, fabius, blamed, scipio, for, corrupting, military, discipline, and, for, having, illegally, left, his, province, to, take, the, town, of, locri, the, author, of, the, abridged, life, of, cato, commonly, considered, the, work, of, cornelius, nepos, asserts, that, cato, after, his, return, from, africa, put, in, at, sardinia, and, brought, the, poet, quintus, ennius, in, his, own, ship, from, the, island, to, italy, but, because, sardinia, is, rather, out, of, the, line, of, the, trip, to, rome, it, is, more, likely, that, the, first, contact, between, ennius, and, cato, happened, at, a, later, date, when, the, latter, was, praetor, in, sardinia, in, 199, bc, cato, was, elected, aedile, and, with, his, colleague, helvius, restored, the, plebeian, games, and, gave, upon, that, occasion, a, banquet, in, honour, of, jupiter, in, 198, bc, he, was, elected, praetor, and, obtained, sardinia, as, his, province, with, the, command, of, 3, 000, infantry, and, 200, cavalry, here, he, took, the, earliest, opportunity, to, demonstrate, his, main, beliefs, by, practicing, his, strict, public, morality, he, reduced, official, operating, costs, walked, his, trips, with, a, single, assistant, and, placed, his, own, frugality, in, contrast, with, the, opulence, of, provincial, magistrates, the, rites, of, religion, were, celebrated, with, thrift, justice, was, administered, with, strict, impartiality, and, usury, was, severely, punished, according, to, aurelius, victor, a, revolt, in, sardinia, was, subdued, by, cato, during, his, praetorship, in, 195, when, he, was, only, 39, years, old, cato, was, elected, junior, consul, to, his, old, friend, and, patron, flaccus, during, his, consulship, he, enacted, the, first, two, of, the, porcian, laws, which, expanded, the, protections, of, roman, citizens, against, degrading, or, capricious, punishment, under, the, republic, s, valerian, law, in, 215, at, the, height, of, the, second, punic, war, and, at, the, request, of, the, tribune, of, the, plebs, gaius, oppius, the, oppian, law, lex, oppia, intended, to, restrict, the, luxury, and, extravagance, of, women, in, order, to, save, money, for, the, public, treasury, was, passed, the, law, specified, that, no, woman, could, own, more, than, half, an, ounce, of, gold, nor, wear, a, garment, of, several, colours, nor, drive, a, carriage, with, horses, closer, than, a, mile, to, the, city, except, to, attend, public, celebrations, of, religious, rites, after, hannibal, was, defeated, and, rome, was, resplendent, with, carthaginian, wealth, tribunes, marcus, fundanius, and, lucius, valerius, proposed, to, abolish, the, oppian, law, but, tribunes, marcus, junius, brutus, and, titus, junius, brutus, opposed, doing, so, this, conflict, spawned, far, more, interest, than, the, most, important, state, affairs, middle, aged, married, roman, women, crowded, the, streets, blocked, access, to, the, forum, and, intercepted, their, approaching, husbands, demanding, to, restore, the, traditional, ornaments, of, roman, matrons, they, even, begged, the, praetors, consuls, and, other, magistrates, even, flaccus, hesitated, but, his, colleague, cato, was, inflexible, and, made, a, characteristically, impolite, speech, which, was, later, retold, by, livy, the, dissenting, tribunes, withdrew, their, opposition, and, the, oppian, law, was, repealed, by, vote, of, all, tribes, women, went, in, procession, through, the, streets, and, the, forum, dressed, up, with, their, now, legitimate, finery, during, the, controversy, cato, maintained, a, firm, opposition, to, the, repeal, so, he, suffered, politically, and, personally, when, it, was, finally, repealed, not, only, had, the, former, consul, been, rejected, by, the, senate, by, unanimous, decision, but, flaccus, failed, to, stand, with, him, however, perhaps, because, of, flaccus, connection, to, lucius, valerius, he, was, deliberately, staying, out, of, the, controversy, he, soon, set, sail, for, his, appointed, province, hispania, citerior, in, his, campaign, in, hispania, cato, behaved, in, keeping, with, his, reputation, of, untiring, hard, work, and, alertness, he, lived, soberly, sharing, the, food, and, the, labours, of, the, common, soldier, wherever, it, was, possible, he, personally, superintended, the, execution, of, his, orders, his, movements, were, reported, as, bold, and, rapid, and, he, always, pushed, for, victory, his, operations, appear, to, have, been, carefully, designed, and, were, coordinated, with, the, plans, of, other, generals, in, other, parts, of, hispania, his, manoeuvres, were, considered, original, and, successful, he, managed, to, benefit, by, setting, tribe, against, tribe, and, took, native, mercenaries, into, his, pay, the, details, of, the, campaign, as, related, by, livy, and, illustrated, by, incidental, anecdotes, by, plutarch, are, full, of, horror, and, they, make, clear, that, cato, reduced, hispania, citerior, to, subjection, with, great, speed, and, little, mercy, we, read, of, multitudes, who, put, themselves, to, death, because, of, the, dishonour, after, they, had, been, stripped, of, all, their, arms, of, extensive, massacres, of, surrendered, troops, and, the, frequent, harsh, plunders, the, phrase, bellum, se, ipsum, alet, the, war, feeds, itself, was, coined, by, cato, during, this, period, his, conduct, in, hispania, were, not, contradictory, with, the, traditional, ideals, of, a, roman, soldier, or, with, his, own, firm, and, over, assertive, temper, he, claimed, to, have, destroyed, more, towns, in, hispania, than, he, had, spent, days, in, that, country, after, he, reduced, the, area, between, the, river, iberus, and, the, pyrenees, to, a, resentful, and, as, it, turned, out, temporary, obedience, cato, turned, his, attention, to, administrative, reforms, and, increased, the, revenues, of, the, province, by, improvements, in, the, working, of, the, iron, and, silver, mines, for, his, achievements, in, hispania, the, senate, decreed, a, thanksgiving, ceremony, of, three, days, in, the, course, of, the, year, 194, bc, he, returned, to, rome, and, was, rewarded, with, the, honour, of, a, roman, triumph, at, which, he, exhibited, an, extraordinary, quantity, of, captured, brass, silver, and, gold, both, coin, and, ingots, cato, distributed, the, monetary, prize, to, his, soldiery, and, was, more, liberal, than, might, have, been, expected, from, his, vigorous, parsimony, the, return, of, cato, seems, to, have, accelerated, the, enmity, of, scipio, africanus, who, was, consul, in, 194, bc, and, is, said, to, have, desired, the, command, of, the, province, in, which, cato, was, harvesting, notoriety, there, is, some, disagreement, between, nepos, or, the, pseudo, nepos, and, plutarch, in, their, accounts, of, this, topic, nepos, claims, that, scipio, failed, to, obtain, the, province, and, offended, by, the, rejection, remained, after, his, consulship, in, a, private, capacity, at, rome, plutarch, claims, that, scipio, who, was, disgusted, by, cato, s, severity, was, appointed, to, succeed, him, but, could, not, convince, the, senate, to, censure, cato, s, administration, and, passed, his, consulship, in, inactivity, plutarch, was, probably, mistaken, judging, by, the, statement, in, livy, that, in, 194, bc, sextus, digitius, was, appointed, to, the, province, of, hispania, citerior, the, notion, that, scipio, was, appointed, successor, to, cato, in, hispania, may, have, arisen, from, a, double, confusion, of, name, and, place, since, publius, cornelius, scipio, nasica, was, chosen, in, 194, bc, to, the, province, of, hispania, ulterior, however, true, this, account, cato, used, his, eloquence, and, produced, detailed, financial, accounts, to, successfully, defend, against, criticism, of, his, consulship, the, known, fragments, of, the, speeches, or, one, speech, under, different, names, made, after, his, return, attest, to, the, strength, of, his, arguments, plutarch, states, that, after, his, consulship, cato, accompanied, tiberius, sempronius, longus, as, legatus, to, thrace, but, this, seems, incorrect, because, although, scipio, africanus, believed, that, one, consul, should, have, macedonia, sempronius, was, soon, in, cisalpine, gaul, and, in, 193, bc, cato, was, in, rome, dedicating, a, small, temple, to, victoria, virgo, the, military, career, of, cato, had, not, yet, ended, in, 191, he, along, with, his, old, associate, lucius, valerius, flaccus, were, appointed, as, lieutenant, generals, legatus, under, the, consul, manius, acilius, glabrio, who, had, been, dispatched, to, greece, to, oppose, the, invasion, of, antiochus, iii, the, great, king, of, the, seleucid, empire, in, the, decisive, battle, of, thermopylae, 191, bc, which, led, to, the, downfall, of, antiochus, cato, behaved, with, his, usual, valor, and, enjoyed, good, fortune, by, a, daring, and, difficult, advance, he, surprised, and, defeated, a, body, of, the, enemy, s, aetolian, auxiliaries, who, were, posted, upon, the, callidromus, the, highest, peak, of, the, range, of, mount, oeta, then, coming, to, the, aid, of, forces, under, flaccus, s, command, he, began, a, sudden, descent, from, the, hills, above, the, royal, camp, and, the, panic, caused, by, this, unexpected, movement, promptly, turned, the, day, in, favor, of, the, romans, and, signaled, the, end, of, the, seleucid, invasion, of, greece, after, the, action, the, consul, hugged, cato, with, the, greatest, warmth, and, attributed, to, him, the, whole, credit, of, the, victory, this, fact, rests, on, the, authority, of, cato, himself, who, like, cicero, often, indulged, in, the, habit, offensive, to, modern, taste, of, sounding, his, own, praises, after, an, interval, spent, in, the, pursuit, of, antiochus, and, the, pacification, of, greece, cato, was, sent, to, rome, by, glabrio, to, announce, the, successful, outcome, of, the, campaign, and, he, performed, his, journey, with, such, celerity, that, he, had, started, his, report, in, the, senate, before, the, return, of, lucius, cornelius, scipio, the, later, conqueror, of, antiochus, who, had, been, sent, off, from, greece, a, few, days, before, him, during, the, campaign, in, greece, under, glabrio, plutarch, s, account, albeit, rejected, by, historian, wilhelm, drumann, suggests, that, before, the, battle, of, thermopylae, cato, was, chosen, to, prevent, corinth, patrae, and, aegium, from, siding, with, antiochus, during, this, period, cato, visited, athens, where, in, trying, to, prevent, the, athenians, from, listening, to, the, propositions, of, the, seleucid, king, cato, addressed, them, in, a, latin, speech, which, required, an, interpreter, to, be, understood, by, the, audience, whether, this, was, out, of, necessity, or, merely, a, choice, by, cato, remains, unclear, since, the, assertion, that, he, might, very, well, have, already, known, greek, at, the, time, can, be, made, from, anecdotal, evidence, for, example, plutarch, said, that, while, at, tarentum, in, his, youth, he, had, developed, a, close, friendship, with, nearchus, who, was, himself, a, greek, philosopher, similarly, aurelius, victor, stated, he, had, received, instruction, in, greek, from, ennius, while, praetor, in, sardinia, nevertheless, because, his, speech, was, an, affair, of, state, it, is, probable, that, he, complied, with, the, roman, norms, of, the, day, in, using, the, latin, language, while, practicing, diplomacy, which, was, considered, as, a, mark, of, roman, dignity, his, reputation, as, a, soldier, was, now, established, henceforth, he, preferred, to, serve, the, state, at, home, scrutinizing, the, conduct, of, the, candidates, for, public, honours, and, of, generals, in, the, field, if, he, was, not, personally, engaged, in, the, prosecution, of, the, scipiones, africanus, and, asiaticus, for, corruption, it, was, his, spirit, that, animated, the, attack, upon, them, even, scipio, africanus, who, refused, to, reply, to, the, charge, saying, only, romans, this, is, the, day, on, which, i, conquered, hannibal, and, was, absolved, by, acclamation, found, it, necessary, to, retire, self, banished, to, his, villa, at, liternum, cato, s, enmity, dated, from, the, african, campaign, when, he, quarreled, with, scipio, for, his, lavish, distribution, of, the, spoil, among, the, troops, and, his, general, luxury, and, extravagance, cato, was, also, opposed, to, the, spread, of, hellenic, culture, which, he, believed, threatened, to, destroy, the, rugged, simplicity, of, the, conventional, roman, type, it, was, during, this, censorship, that, his, determination, to, oppose, hellenism, was, most, strongly, exhibited, and, hence, the, behavior, from, which, was, derived, the, title, censor, by, which, he, is, most, generally, distinguished, he, revised, with, unsparing, severity, the, lists, of, senators, and, knights, ejecting, from, either, order, the, men, whom, he, judged, unworthy, of, membership, either, on, moral, grounds, or, on, the, basis, of, their, lack, of, the, prescribed, means, senators, were, supposed, to, be,

the, erection, of, the, basilica, cato, s, expenditure, on, public, works, were, objected, by, the, party, of, titus, flamininus, and, also, deemed, trivial, by, the, senate, after, gaining,

struck, with, horror, along, with, many, other, romans, at, the, licence, of, the, bacchanalian, mysteries, which, he, attributed, to, the, influence, of, greek, manners, and, he, vehemently, urged, the, dismissal, of, the, philosophers, carneades, diogenes, and, critolaus, who, had, come, as, ambassadors, from, athens, on, account, of, what, he, believed, was, the, dangerous, nature, of, their, ideas, he, also, uttered, warnings, against, the, influence, of, chaldean, astrologers, who, had, entered, italy, along, with, greek, culture, he, had, a, horror, of, physicians, who, were, chiefly, greeks, he, obtained, the, release, of, polybius, the, historian, and, his, fellow, prisoners, contemptuously, asking, whether, the, senate, had, nothing, more, important, to, do, than, discuss, whether, a, few, greeks, should, die, at, rome, or, in, their, own, land, it, was, not, until, his, eightieth, year, that, he, made, his, first, acquaintance, with, greek, literature, though, some, think, after, examining, his, writings, that, he, may, have, had, a, knowledge, of, greek, works, for, much, of, his, life, in, his, last, years, he, was, known, for, strenuously, urging, his, countrymen, to, prosecute, the, third, punic, war, and, to, destroy, carthage, in, 157, he, was, one, of, the, deputies, sent, to, carthage, to, arbitrate, between, the, carthaginians, and, massinissa, king, of, numidia, the, mission, was, unsuccessful, and, the, commissioners, returned, home, but, cato, was, so, struck, by, carthage, s, growing, prosperity, that, he, was, convinced, that, the, security, of, rome, depended, on, its, annihilation, from, then, on, he, began, concluding, his, speeches, in, the, senate, on, any, topic, whatsoever, with, the, cry, carthage, must, be,

himself, a, hard, husband, a, strict, father, and, a, severe, and, cruel, master, there, was, little, difference, apparently, in, the, esteem, in, which, he, held, his, wife, and, his, slaves, although, perhaps, his, pride, caused, him, to, take, a, warmer, interest, in, his, sons, marcus, porcius, cato, licinianus, and, marcus, porcius, cato, salonianus, to, the, romans, themselves, little, in, this, behavior, seemed, worthy, of, censure, it, was, respected, rather, as, a, traditional, example, of, the, old, roman, manners, in, the, remarkable, passage, in, which, livy,

the, first, latin, prose, writer, of, any, importance, and, the, first, author, of, a, history, of, italy, in, latin, some, have, argued, that, if, it, were, not, for, the, impact, of, cato, s, writing, latin, might, have, been, supplanted, by, greek, as, the, literary, language, of, rome, he, was, also, one, of, the, very, few, early, latin, authors, who, could, claim, latin, as, a, native, language, in, due, course, my, son, marcus, i, shall, explain, what, i, found, out, in, athens, about, these, greeks, and, demonstrate, what, advantage, there, may, be, in, looking, into, their,
