pieter, bruegel, also, brueghel, or, breughel, the, elder, b, r, l, broy, g, l, us, also, b, r, u, l, broo, g, l, dutch, c, 1525, 1530, 9, september, 1569, was, among, the, most, significant, artists, of, dutch, and, flemish, renaissance, painting, a, painter, and, printmaker, known, for, his, landscapes, and, peasant, scenes, so, called, genre, painting, he, was, a, pioneer, in, presenting, both, types, of, subject, as, large, paintings, he, was, a, formative, influence, on, dutch, golden, age, painting, and, later, painting, in, general, in, his, innovative, choices, of, subject, matter, as, one, of, the, first, generation, of, artists, to, grow, up, when, religious, subjects, had, ceased, to, be, the, natural, subject, matter, of, painting, he, also, painted, no, portraits, the, other, mainstay, of, netherlandish, art, after, his, training, and, travels, to, italy, he, returned, in, 1555, to, settle, in, antwerp, where, he, worked, mainly, as, a, prolific, designer, of, prints, for, the, leading, publisher, of, the, day, at, the, end, of, the, 1550s, he, made, painting, his, main, medium, and, all, his, famous, paintings, come, from, the, following, period, of, little, more, than, a, decade, before, his, early, death, in, 1569, when, he, was, probably, in, his, early, forties, in, the, 20th, and, 21st, centuries, bruegel, s, works, have, inspired, artists, in, both, the, literary, arts, and, in, cinema, his, painting, landscape, with, the, fall, of, icarus, now, thought, only, to, survive, in, copies, is, the, subject, of, the, final, lines, of, the, 1938, poem, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, by, w, h, auden, russian, film, director, andrei, tarkovsky, refers, to, bruegel, s, paintings, in, his, films, several, times, including, solaris, 1972, and, the, mirror, 1975, director, lars, von, trier, also, uses, bruegel, s, paintings, in, his, film, melancholia, 2011, in, 2011, the, film, the, mill, and, the, cross, was, released, featuring, bruegel, s, the, procession, to, calvary, bruegel, bruegel, s, birth, date, is, not, documented, but, inferred, from, the, fact, that, bruegel, entered, the, antwerp, painters, guild, in, 1551, this, usually, happened, between, the, ages, of, twenty, to, twenty, five, giving, a, range, for, his, birth, between, 1525, and, 1530, his, master, according, to, karel, van, mander, was, the, antwerp, painter, pieter, coecke, van, aelst, the, two, main, early, sources, for, bruegel, s, biography, are, lodovico, guicciardini, s, account, of, the, low, countries, 1567, and, karel, van, mander, s, 1604, schilder, boeck, guicciardini, recorded, that, bruegel, was, born, in, breda, but, van, mander, specified, that, bruegel, was, born, in, a, village, dorp, near, breda, called, brueghel, which, does, not, fit, any, known, place, nothing, at, all, is, known, of, his, family, background, van, mander, seems, to, assume, he, came, from, a, peasant, background, in, keeping, with, the, over, emphasis, on, bruegel, s, peasant, genre, scenes, given, by, van, mander, and, many, early, art, historians, and, critics, in, contrast, scholars, of, the, last, six, decades, have, emphasised, the, intellectual, content, of, his, work, and, conclude, there, is, in, fact, every, reason, to, think, that, pieter, bruegel, was, a, townsman, and, a, highly, educated, one, on, friendly, terms, with, the, humanists, of, his, time, ignoring, van, mander, s, dorp, and, just, placing, his, childhood, in, breda, itself, breda, was, already, a, significant, centre, as, the, base, of, the, house, of, orange, nassau, with, a, population, of, some, 8, 000, although, 90, of, its, 1300, houses, were, destroyed, in, a, fire, in, 1534, this, reversal, can, be, taken, to, excess, although, bruegel, moved, in, highly, educated, humanist, circles, it, seems, he, had, not, mastered, latin, and, had, others, add, the, latin, captions, in, some, of, his, drawings, between, 1545, and, 1550, he, was, a, pupil, of, pieter, coecke, who, died, on, 6, december, 1550, before, this, bruegel, was, already, working, in, mechelen, where, he, is, documented, between, september, 1550, and, october, 1551, assisting, peeter, baltens, on, an, altarpiece, now, lost, painting, the, wings, in, grisaille, bruegel, possibly, got, this, work, via, the, connections, of, mayken, verhulst, the, wife, of, pieter, coecke, mayken, s, father, and, eight, siblings, were, all, artists, or, married, artists, and, lived, in, mechelen, in, 1551, bruegel, became, a, free, master, in, the, guild, of, saint, luke, of, antwerp, he, set, off, for, italy, soon, after, probably, by, way, of, france, he, visited, rome, and, rather, adventurously, for, the, period, by, 1552, had, reached, reggio, calabria, at, the, southern, tip, of, the, mainland, where, a, drawing, records, the, city, in, flames, after, a, turkish, raid, he, probably, continued, to, sicily, but, by, 1553, was, back, in, rome, there, he, met, the, miniaturist, giulio, clovio, whose, will, of, 1578, lists, paintings, by, bruegel, in, one, case, a, joint, work, these, works, apparently, landscapes, have, not, survived, but, marginal, miniatures, in, manuscripts, by, clovio, are, attributed, to, bruegel, he, left, italy, by, 1554, and, had, reached, antwerp, by, 1555, when, the, set, of, prints, to, his, designs, known, as, the, large, landscapes, were, published, by, hieronymus, cock, the, most, important, print, publisher, of, northern, europe, bruegel, s, return, route, is, uncertain, but, much, of, the, debate, over, it, was, made, irrelevant, in, the, 1980s, when, it, was, realised, that, the, celebrated, series, of, large, drawings, of, mountain, landscapes, thought, to, have, been, made, on, the, trip, were, not, by, bruegel, at, all, all, the, drawings, from, the, trip, that, are, considered, authentic, are, of, landscapes, unlike, most, other, 16th, century, artists, visiting, rome, he, seems, to, have, ignored, both, classical, ruins, and, contemporary, buildings, from, 1555, until, 1563, bruegel, lived, in, antwerp, then, the, publishing, centre, of, northern, europe, mainly, working, as, a, designer, of, over, forty, prints, for, cock, though, his, dated, paintings, begin, in, 1557, with, one, exception, bruegel, did, not, work, the, plates, himself, but, produced, a, drawing, which, cock, s, specialists, worked, from, from, 1559, he, dropped, the, h, from, his, name, and, signed, his, paintings, as, bruegel, his, relatives, continued, to, use, brueghel, or, breughel, he, moved, in, the, lively, humanist, circles, of, the, city, and, his, change, of, name, or, at, least, its, spelling, in, 1559, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, latinise, it, at, the, same, time, he, changed, the, script, he, signed, in, from, the, gothic, blackletter, to, roman, capitals, in, 1563, he, married, pieter, coecke, van, aelst, s, daughter, mayken, coecke, in, brussels, where, he, lived, for, the, remainder, of, his, short, life, antwerp, was, the, capital, of, netherlandish, commerce, and, the, art, market, brussels, was, the, centre, of, government, van, mander, tells, a, story, that, his, mother, in, law, pushed, for, the, move, to, distance, him, from, his, established, servant, girl, mistress, by, now, painting, had, become, his, main, activity, and, his, most, famous, works, come, from, these, years, his, paintings, were, much, sought, after, with, patrons, including, wealthy, flemish, collectors, and, cardinal, granvelle, in, effect, the, habsburg, chief, minister, who, was, based, in, mechelen, bruegel, had, two, sons, both, well, known, as, painters, and, a, daughter, about, whom, nothing, is, known, these, were, pieter, brueghel, the, younger, 1564, 1638, and, jan, brueghel, the, elder, 1568, 1625, he, died, too, early, to, train, either, of, them, he, died, in, brussels, on, 9, september, 1569, and, was, buried, in, the, kapellekerk, van, mander, records, that, before, he, died, he, told, his, wife, to, burn, some, drawings, perhaps, designs, for, prints, carrying, inscriptions, which, were, too, sharp, or, sarcastic, either, out, of, remorse, or, for, fear, that, she, might, come, to, harm, or, in, some, way, be, held, responsible, for, them, which, has, led, to, much, speculation, that, they, were, politically, or, doctrinally, provocative, in, a, climate, of, sharp, tension, in, these, areas, bruegel, was, born, at, a, time, of, extensive, change, in, western, europe, humanist, ideals, from, the, previous, century, influenced, artists, and, scholars, italy, was, at, the, end, of, its, high, renaissance, of, arts, and, culture, when, artists, such, as, michelangelo, and, leonardo, da, vinci, painted, their, masterpieces, in, 1517, about, eight, years, before, bruegel, s, birth, martin, luther, created, his, ninety, five, theses, and, began, the, protestant, reformation, in, neighbouring, germany, reformation, was, accompanied, by, iconoclasm, and, widespread, destruction, of, art, including, in, the, low, countries, the, catholic, church, viewed, protestantism, and, its, destructive, iconoclasm, of, art, as, a, threat, to, the, church, the, council, of, trent, which, concluded, in, 1563, determined, that, religious, art, should, be, more, focused, on, religious, subject, matter, and, less, on, material, things, and, decorative, qualities, at, this, time, the, low, countries, were, divided, into, seventeen, provinces, some, of, which, wanted, separation, from, the, habsburg, rule, based, in, spain, the, reformation, meanwhile, produced, a, number, of, protestant, denominations, that, gained, followers, in, the, seventeen, provinces, influenced, by, the, newly, lutheran, german, states, to, the, east, and, the, newly, anglican, england, to, the, west, the, habsburg, monarchs, of, spain, attempted, a, policy, of, strict, religious, uniformity, for, the, catholic, church, within, their, domains, and, enforced, it, with, the, inquisition, increasing, religious, antagonisms, and, riots, political, manoeuvrings, and, executions, eventually, resulted, in, the, outbreak, of, the, eighty, years, war, in, this, atmosphere, bruegel, reached, the, height, of, his, career, as, a, painter, two, years, before, his, death, the, eighty, years, war, began, between, the, united, provinces, and, spain, although, bruegel, did, not, live, to, see, it, seven, provinces, became, independent, and, formed, the, dutch, republic, while, the, other, ten, remained, under, habsburg, control, at, the, end, of, the, war, pieter, bruegel, specialised, in, genre, paintings, populated, by, peasants, often, with, a, landscape, element, though, he, also, painted, religious, works, making, the, life, and, manners, of, peasants, the, main, focus, of, a, work, was, rare, in, painting, in, bruegel, s, time, and, he, was, a, pioneer, of, the, genre, painting, many, of, his, peasant, paintings, fall, into, two, groups, in, terms, of, scale, and, composition, both, of, which, were, original, and, influential, on, later, painting, his, earlier, style, shows, dozens, of, small, figures, seen, from, a, high, viewpoint, and, spread, fairly, evenly, across, the, central, picture, space, the, setting, is, typically, an, urban, space, surrounded, by, buildings, within, which, the, figures, have, a, fundamentally, disconnected, manner, of, portrayal, with, individuals, or, small, groups, engaged, in, their, own, distinct, activity, while, ignoring, all, the, others, his, earthy, unsentimental, but, vivid, depiction, of, the, rituals, of, village, life, including, agriculture, hunts, meals, festivals, dances, and, games, are, unique, windows, on, a, vanished, folk, culture, though, still, characteristic, of, belgian, life, and, culture, today, and, a, prime, source, of, iconographic, evidence, about, both, physical, and, social, aspects, of, 16th, century, life, for, example, his, famous, painting, netherlandish, proverbs, originally, the, blue, cloak, illustrates, dozens, of, then, contemporary, aphorisms, many, of, which, still, are, in, use, in, current, flemish, french, english, and, dutch, the, flemish, environment, provided, a, large, artistic, audience, for, proverb, filled, paintings, because, proverbs, were, well, known, and, recognisable, as, well, as, entertaining, children, s, games, shows, the, variety, of, amusements, enjoyed, by, young, people, his, winter, landscapes, of, 1565, like, the, hunters, in, the, snow, are, taken, as, corroborative, evidence, of, the, severity, of, winters, during, the, little, ice, age, bruegel, often, painted, community, events, as, in, the, peasant, wedding, and, the, fight, between, carnival, and, lent, in, paintings, like, the, peasant, wedding, bruegel, painted, individual, identifiable, people, while, the, people, in, the, fight, between, carnival, and, lent, are, unidentifiable, muffin, faced, allegories, of, greed, or, gluttony, bruegel, also, painted, religious, scenes, in, a, wide, flemish, landscape, setting, as, in, the, conversion, of, paul, and, the, sermon, of, st, john, the, baptist, even, if, bruegel, s, subject, matter, was, unconventional, the, religious, ideals, and, proverbs, driving, his, paintings, were, typical, of, the, northern, renaissance, he, accurately, depicted, people, with, disabilities, such, as, in, the, blind, leading, the, blind, which, depicted, a, quote, from, the, bible, if, the, blind, lead, the, blind, both, shall, fall, into, the, ditch, matthew, 15, 14, using, the, bible, to, interpret, this, painting, the, six, blind, men, are, symbols, of, the, blindness, of, mankind, in, pursuing, earthly, goals, instead, of, focusing, on, christ, s, teachings, using, abundant, spirit, and, comic, power, bruegel, created, some, of, the, very, early, images, of, acute, social, protest, in, art, history, examples, include, paintings, such, as, the, fight, between, carnival, and, lent, a, satire, of, the, conflicts, of, the, protestant, reformation, and, engravings, like, the, ass, in, the, school, and, strongboxes, battling, piggybanks, in, the, 1560s, bruegel, moved, to, a, style, showing, only, a, few, large, figures, typically, in, a, landscape, background, without, a, distant, view, his, paintings, dominated, by, their, landscapes, take, a, middle, course, as, regards, both, the, number, and, size, of, figures, bruegel, adapted, and, made, more, natural, the, world, landscape, style, which, shows, small, figures, in, an, imaginary, panoramic, landscape, seen, from, an, elevated, viewpoint, that, includes, mountains, and, lowlands, water, and, buildings, back, in, antwerp, from, italy, he, was, commissioned, in, the, 1550s, by, the, publisher, hieronymus, cock, to, make, drawings, for, a, series, of, engravings, the, large, landscapes, to, meet, what, was, now, a, growing, demand, for, landscape, images, some, of, his, earlier, paintings, such, as, his, landscape, with, the, flight, into, egypt, courtauld, 1563, are, fully, within, the, patinir, conventions, but, his, landscape, with, the, fall, of, icarus, known, from, two, copies, had, a, patinir, style, landscape, in, which, already, the, largest, figure, was, a, genre, figure, who, was, only, a, bystander, for, the, supposed, narrative, subject, and, may, not, even, be, aware, of, it, the, date, of, bruegel, s, lost, original, is, unclear, but, it, is, probably, relatively, early, and, if, so, foreshadows, the, trend, of, his, later, works, during, the, 1560s, the, early, scenes, crowded, with, multitudes, of, very, small, figures, whether, peasant, genre, figures, or, figures, in, religious, narratives, give, way, to, a, small, number, of, much, larger, figures, his, famous, set, of, landscapes, with, genre, figures, depicting, the, seasons, are, the, culmination, of, his, landscape, style, the, five, surviving, paintings, use, the, basic, elements, of, the, world, landscape, only, one, lacks, craggy, mountains, but, transform, them, into, his, own, style, they, are, larger, than, most, previous, works, with, a, genre, scene, with, several, figures, in, the, foreground, and, the, panoramic, view, seen, past, or, through, trees, bruegel, was, also, aware, of, the, danube, school, s, landscape, style, through, old, master, prints, the, surviving, five, paintings, are, the, gloomy, day, february, march, the, hunters, in, the, snow, december, january, and, the, return, of, the, herd, october, november, which, are, on, display, in, the, kunsthistorisches, museum, in, vienna, the, hay, harvest, june, july, is, on, display, in, the, lobkowicz, palace, in, prague, and, the, harvesters, which, is, on, display, at, the, metropolitan, in, new, york, the, painting, associated, with, the, april, may, seasonal, transition, is, assumed, to, be, lost, the, series, on, the, months, of, the, year, includes, several, of, bruegel, s, best, known, works, in, 1565, a, wealthy, patron, in, antwerp, niclaes, jonghelinck, commissioned, him, to, paint, a, series, of, paintings, of, each, month, of, the, year, there, has, been, dispute, among, art, historians, as, to, whether, the, series, originally, included, six, or, twelve, works, joseph, koerner, in, his, 2018, book, bosch, and, bruegel, states, that, archduke, ernst, who, took, possession, of, the, paintings, after, niclaes, defaulted, on, taxes, had, as, early, as, 1569, inventoried, only, six, paintings, in, this, series, during, the, year, of, bruegel, s, death, the, collection, is, next, inventoried, to, be, in, the, possession, of, archduke, leopold, who, in, 1659, indicated, that, five, of, them, were, extant, only, five, of, these, paintings, are, known, to, have, survived, into, the, 21st, century, traditional, flemish, luxury, books, of, hours, e, g, the, tr, s, riches, heures, du, duc, de, berry, 1416, had, calendar, pages, that, included, the, labours, of, the, months, depictions, set, in, landscapes, of, the, agricultural, tasks, weather, and, social, life, typical, for, that, month, bruegel, s, paintings, were, on, a, far, larger, scale, than, a, typical, calendar, page, painting, each, one, approximately, three, feet, by, five, feet, for, bruegel, this, was, a, large, commission, the, price, of, a, commission, was, based, on, how, large, the, painting, was, and, an, important, one, in, 1565, the, calvinist, riots, began, and, it, was, only, two, years, before, the, eighty, years, war, broke, out, bruegel, may, have, felt, safer, with, a, secular, commission, so, as, to, not, offend, calvinist, or, catholic, some, of, the, most, famous, paintings, from, this, series, included, the, hunters, in, the, snow, december, january, and, the, harvesters, august, september, on, his, return, from, italy, to, antwerp, bruegel, earned, his, living, producing, drawings, to, be, turned, into, prints, for, the, leading, print, publisher, of, the, city, and, indeed, northern, europe, hieronymus, cock, at, his, house, of, the, four, winds, cock, ran, a, production, and, distribution, operation, efficiently, turning, out, prints, of, many, sorts, that, was, more, concerned, with, sales, than, the, finest, artistic, achievement, most, of, bruegel, s, prints, come, from, this, period, but, he, continued, to, produce, drawn, designs, for, prints, until, the, end, of, his, life, leaving, only, two, completed, out, of, a, series, of, the, four, seasons, the, prints, were, popular, and, it, is, reasonable, to, assume, that, all, those, published, have, survived, in, many, cases, we, also, have, bruegel, s, drawings, although, the, subject, matter, of, his, graphic, work, was, often, continued, in, his, paintings, there, are, considerable, differences, in, emphases, between, the, two, oeuvres, to, his, contemporaries, and, for, long, after, until, public, museums, and, good, reproductions, of, the, paintings, made, these, better, known, bruegel, was, much, better, known, through, his, prints, than, his, paintings, which, largely, explains, the, critical, assessment, of, him, as, merely, the, creator, of, comic, peasant, scenes, the, prints, are, mostly, engravings, though, from, about, 1559, onwards, some, are, etchings, or, mixtures, of, both, techniques, only, one, complete, woodcut, was, made, from, a, bruegel, design, with, another, left, incomplete, this, the, dirty, wife, is, a, most, unusual, survival, now, metropolitan, museum, of, art, of, a, drawing, on, the, wooden, block, intended, for, printing, for, some, reason, the, specialist, block, cutter, who, carved, away, the, block, following, the, drawing, while, also, destroying, it, had, only, done, one, corner, of, the, design, before, stopping, work, the, design, then, appears, as, an, engraving, perhaps, soon, after, bruegel, s, death, among, his, greatest, successes, were, a, series, of, allegories, among, several, designs, adopting, many, of, the, very, individual, mannerisms, of, his, compatriot, hieronymus, bosch, the, seven, deadly, sins, and, the, virtues, the, sinners, are, grotesque, and, unidentifiable, while, the, allegories, of, virtue, often, wear, odd, headgear, that, imitations, of, bosch, sold, well, is, demonstrated, by, his, drawing, big, fish, eat, little, fish, now, albertina, which, bruegel, signed, but, cock, shamelessly, attributed, to, bosch, in, the, print, version, although, bruegel, presumably, made, them, no, drawings, that, are, clearly, preparatory, studies, for, paintings, survive, most, surviving, drawings, are, finished, designs, for, prints, or, landscape, drawings, that, are, fairly, finished, after, a, considerable, purge, of, attributions, in, recent, decades, led, by, hans, mielke, sixty, one, sheets, of, drawings, are, now, generally, agreed, to, be, by, bruegel, a, new, master, of, the, mountain, landscapes, has, emerged, from, the, carnage, mielke, s, key, observation, was, that, the, lily, watermark, on, the, paper, of, several, sheets, was, only, found, from, around, 1580, onwards, which, led, to, the, rapid, acceptance, of, his, proposal, another, group, of, about, twenty, five, pen, drawings, of, landscapes, many, signed, and, dated, as, by, bruegel, are, now, given, to, jacob, savery, probably, from, the, decade, of, so, before, his, death, in, 1603, a, giveaway, was, that, two, drawings, including, the, walls, of, amsterdam, were, dated, 1563, but, included, elements, only, built, in, the, 1590s, this, group, appears, to, have, been, made, as, deliberate, forgeries, around, 1563, bruegel, moved, from, antwerp, to, brussels, where, he, married, mayken, coecke, the, daughter, of, the, painter, pieter, coecke, van, aelst, and, mayken, verhulst, as, registered, in, the, archives, of, the, cathedral, of, antwerp, their, deposition, for, marriage, was, registered, 25, july, 1563, the, marriage, was, concluded, in, the, chapel, church, brussels, in, 1563, pieter, the, elder, had, two, sons, pieter, brueghel, the, younger, and, jan, brueghel, the, elder, both, kept, their, name, as, brueghel, their, grandmother, mayken, verhulst, trained, the, sons, because, the, elder, died, when, both, were, very, small, children, the, older, brother, pieter, brueghel, copied, his, father, s, style, and, compositions, with, competence, and, considerable, commercial, success, jan, was, much, more, original, and, very, versatile, he, was, an, important, figure, in, the, transition, to, the, baroque, style, in, flemish, baroque, painting, and, dutch, golden, age, painting, in, a, number, of, its, genres, he, was, often, a, collaborator, with, other, leading, artists, including, with, peter, paul, rubens, on, many, works, including, the, allegory, of, sight, other, members, of, the, family, include, jan, van, kessel, the, elder, grandson, of, jan, brueghel, the, elder, and, jan, van, kessel, the, younger, through, david, teniers, the, younger, son, in, law, of, jan, brueghel, the, elder, the, family, is, also, related, to, the, whole, teniers, family, of, painters, and, the, quellinus, family, of, painters, and, sculptors, through, the, marriage, of, jan, erasmus, quellinus, to, cornelia, daughter, of, david, teniers, the, younger, bruegel, s, art, was, long, more, highly, valued, by, collectors, than, critics, his, friend, abraham, ortelius, described, him, in, a, friendship, album, in, 1574, as, the, most, perfect, painter, of, his, century, but, both, vasari, and, van, mander, see, him, as, essentially, a, comic, successor, to, hieronymus, bosch, as, well, as, being, forward, looking, his, art, reinvigorates, medieval, subjects, such, as, marginal, drolleries, of, ordinary, life, in, illuminated, manuscripts, and, the, calendar, scenes, of, agricultural, labours, set, in, landscape, backgrounds, and, puts, these, on, a, much, larger, scale, than, before, and, in, the, expensive, medium, of, oil, painting, he, does, the, same, with, the, fantastic, and, anarchic, world, developed, in, renaissance, prints, and, book, illustrations, bruegel, s, work, was, as, far, as, we, know, always, keenly, collected, the, banker, nicolaes, jonghelinck, owned, sixteen, paintings, his, brother, jacques, jonghelinck, was, a, gentleman, sculptor, and, medallist, who, also, had, significant, business, interests, he, made, medals, and, tombs, in, an, international, style, for, the, brussels, elite, especially, cardinal, granvelle, who, was, also, a, keen, patron, of, bruegel, granvelle, owned, at, least, two, bruegels, including, the, courtauld, flight, into, egypt, but, we, do, not, know, if, he, bought, them, directly, from, the, artist, granvelle, s, nephew, and, heir, was, strong, armed, out, of, his, bruegels, by, rudolf, ii, the, very, acquisitive, austrian, habsburg, emperor, the, series, of, the, months, entered, the, habsburg, collections, in, 1594, given, to, rudolf, s, brother, and, later, taken, by, the, emperor, himself, rudolf, eventually, owned, at, least, ten, bruegel, paintings, a, generation, later, rubens, owned, eleven, or, twelve, which, mostly, passed, to, the, antwerp, senator, pieter, stevens, and, were, then, sold, in, 1668, bruegel, s, son, pieter, could, still, keep, himself, and, a, large, studio, team, busy, producing, replicas, or, adaptations, of, bruegel, s, works, as, well, as, his, own, compositions, along, similar, lines, sixty, years, or, more, after, they, were, first, painted, the, most, frequently, copied, works, were, generally, not, the, ones, that, are, most, famous, today, though, this, may, reflect, the, availability, of, the, full, scale, detailed, drawings, that, were, evidently, used, the, most, copied, painting, is, the, winter, landscape, with, skaters, and, a, bird, trap, 1565, of, which, the, original, is, in, brussels, 127, copies, are, recorded, they, include, paintings, after, some, of, bruegel, s, drawn, print, designs, especially, spring, the, next, century, s, artists, of, peasant, genre, scenes, were, heavily, influenced, by, brueghel, outside, the, brueghel, family, early, figures, were, adriaen, brouwer, c, 1605, 6, 1638, and, david, vinckboons, 1576, c, 1632, both, flemish, born, but, spending, much, of, their, time, in, the, northern, netherlands, as, well, as, the, general, conception, of, such, kermis, subjects, vinckboons, and, other, artists, took, from, bruegel, such, stylistic, devices, as, the, bird, s, eye, perspective, ornamentalised, vegetation, bright, palette, and, stocky, odious, figures, forty, years, after, their, deaths, and, over, a, century, after, bruegel, s, jan, steen, 1626, 79, continued, to, show, a, particular, interest, in, bruegelian, treatments, the, critical, treatment, of, bruegel, as, essentially, an, artist, of, comic, peasant, scenes, persisted, until, the, late, 19th, century, even, after, his, best, paintings, became, widely, visible, as, royal, and, aristocratic, collections, were, turned, into, museums, this, had, been, partly, explicable, when, his, work, was, mainly, known, from, copies, prints, and, reproductions, even, henri, hymans, whose, work, of, 1890, 1891, was, the, first, important, contribution, to, modern, bruegel, scholarship, could, describe, him, thus, his, field, of, enquiry, is, certainly, not, of, the, most, extensive, his, ambition, too, is, modest, he, confines, himself, to, a, knowledge, of, mankind, and, the, most, immediate, objects, a, line, no, modern, scholar, is, likely, to, take, as, his, landscape, paintings, in, good, colour, reproduction, have, become, his, best, loved, works, so, his, importance, in, the, history, of, landscape, art, has, become, understood, there, are, about, forty, generally, accepted, surviving, paintings, twelve, of, which, are, in, the, kunsthistorisches, museum, in, vienna, others, are, known, to, have, been, lost, including, what, according, to, van, mander, bruegel, himself, thought, his, best, work, a, picture, in, which, truth, triumphs, bruegel, only, etched, one, plate, himself, the, rabbit, hunt, but, designed, some, forty, prints, both, engravings, and, etchings, mostly, for, the, cock, publishing, house, as, discussed, above, about, sixty, one, drawings, are, now, recognised, as, authentic, mostly, designs, for, prints, or, landscapes, his, painting, landscape, with, the, fall, of, icarus, now, thought, only, to, survive, in, copies, is, the, subject, of, the, final, lines, of, the, 1938, poem, mus, e, des, beaux, arts, by, w, h, auden, in, brueghel, s, icarus, for, instance, how, everything, turns, away, quite, leisurely, from, the, disaster, the,
