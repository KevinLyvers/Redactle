hatshepsut, h, t, p, s, t, haht, shepp, sut, c, 1507, 1458, bc, was, the, great, royal, wife, of, pharaoh, thutmose, ii, and, the, fifth, pharaoh, of, the, eighteenth, dynasty, of, egypt, ruling, first, as, regent, then, as, queen, regnant, from, c, 1479, bc, until, c, 1458, bc, low, chronology, she, was, egypt, s, second, confirmed, queen, regnant, the, first, being, sobekneferu, nefrusobek, in, the, twelfth, dynasty, hatshepsut, was, the, daughter, of, thutmose, i, and, great, royal, wife, ahmose, upon, the, death, of, her, husband, and, half, brother, thutmose, ii, she, had, initially, ruled, as, regent, to, her, stepson, thutmose, iii, who, inherited, the, throne, at, the, age, of, two, several, years, into, her, regency, hatshepsut, assumed, the, position, of, pharaoh, and, adopted, the, full, royal, titulary, making, her, a, co, ruler, alongside, thutmose, iii, in, order, to, establish, herself, in, the, egyptian, patriarchy, she, took, on, traditionally, male, roles, and, was, depicted, as, a, male, pharaoh, with, physically, masculine, traits, and, traditionally, male, garb, hatshepsut, s, reign, was, a, period, of, great, prosperity, and, general, peace, one, of, the, most, prolific, builders, in, ancient, egypt, she, oversaw, large, scale, construction, projects, such, as, the, karnak, temple, complex, the, red, chapel, the, speos, artemidos, and, most, famously, the, mortuary, temple, of, hatshepsut, at, deir, el, bahari, hatshepsut, died, probably, in, year, 22, of, thutmose, iii, towards, the, end, of, the, reign, of, thutmose, iii, and, into, the, reign, of, his, son, amenhotep, ii, an, attempt, was, made, to, remove, her, from, official, accounts, of, egyptian, historiography, her, statues, were, destroyed, her, monuments, were, defaced, and, many, of, her, achievements, were, ascribed, to, other, pharaohs, many, modern, historians, attribute, this, to, ritual, and, religious, reasons, rather, than, personal, hostility, as, previously, thought, hatshepsut, was, born, in, 1507, bc, and, is, believed, to, have, been, the, daughter, of, thutmose, i, and, his, great, royal, wife, ahmose, after, her, father, s, death, hatshepsut, was, then, married, to, thutmose, ii, her, half, brother, and, father, s, heir, when, she, was, fourteen, or, fifteen, years, old, the, couple, were, around, the, same, age, upon, the, death, of, thutmose, ii, the, underage, thutmose, iii, became, the, pharaoh, of, egypt, hatshepsut, was, thought, of, by, early, modern, scholars, to, have, only, served, as, regent, alongside, him, however, modern, scholars, agree, that, while, she, initially, served, as, regent, for, young, thutmose, iii, from, his, accession, in, c, 1479, bc, hatshepsut, eventually, assumed, the, position, of, pharaoh, alongside, him, by, year, 7, of, his, reign, c, 1472, bc, becoming, queen, regnant, hatshepsut, shared, thutmose, iii, s, existing, regnal, count, effectively, back, dating, her, accession, as, pharaoh, to, year, 1, when, she, had, been, merely, regent, although, queens, sobekneferu, and, possibly, nitocris, may, have, previously, assumed, the, role, of, pharaoh, hatshepsut, was, the, only, female, ruler, to, do, so, in, a, time, of, prosperity, and, she, arguably, had, more, powers, than, her, female, predecessors, retrospectively, hatshepsut, was, described, by, ancient, authors, as, having, reigned, for, about, 21, 22, years, which, included, both, her, regency, and, her, reign, as, queen, regnant, josephus, and, julius, africanus, follow, the, earlier, testimony, of, manetho, 3rd, century, bc, mentioning, a, queen, regnant, called, amessis, or, amensis, specified, by, josephus, as, having, been, the, sister, of, her, predecessor, this, woman, was, later, identified, by, historians, as, hatshepsut, in, josephus, s, text, her, reign, is, described, as, lasting, for, 21, years, and, 9, months, while, africanus, states, it, as, 22, years, apparently, rounding, up, the, latest, attestation, of, hatshepsut, in, contemporary, records, comes, from, year, 20, of, the, regnal, count, of, thutmose, iii, she, is, no, longer, mentioned, in, year, 22, when, he, undertook, his, first, major, foreign, campaign, this, is, compatible, with, the, 21, years, 9, months, recorded, by, manetho, and, josephus, which, would, place, the, end, of, hatshepsut, s, reign, in, year, 22, of, thutmose, iii, dating, the, beginning, of, her, reign, is, more, difficult, her, father, thutmose, i, began, his, reign, in, either, 1526, bc, or, 1506, bc, according, to, the, high, and, low, estimates, of, her, reign, although, the, length, of, the, reigns, of, thutmose, i, and, thutmose, ii, cannot, be, determined, with, certainty, with, short, reigns, hatshepsut, would, have, ascended, the, throne, 14, years, after, her, father, s, coronation, longer, reigns, would, put, her, accession, 25, years, after, his, coronation, the, earliest, attestation, of, hatshepsut, as, pharaoh, occurs, in, the, tomb, of, ramose, and, hatnofer, where, a, collection, of, grave, goods, contained, a, single, pottery, jar, or, amphora, from, the, tomb, s, chamber, stamped, with, the, date, year, 7, another, jar, from, the, same, tomb, discovered, in, situ, by, a, 1935, 36, metropolitan, museum, of, art, expedition, on, a, hillside, near, thebes, was, stamped, with, the, seal, of, the, god, s, wife, hatshepsut, and, two, jars, bore, the, seal, of, the, good, goddess, maatkare, the, dating, of, the, amphorae, sealed, into, the, burial, chamber, by, the, debris, from, senenmut, s, own, tomb, is, undisputed, meaning, that, hatshepsut, was, acknowledged, as, pharaoh, of, egypt, and, no, longer, merely, regent, by, year, 7, of, her, reign, she, was, certainly, pharaoh, by, year, 9, the, date, of, the, punt, expedition, c, 1471, bc, her, last, dated, attestation, as, pharaoh, is, year, 20, c, 1460, bc, and, she, no, longer, appears, in, year, 22, c, 1458, hatshepsut, re, established, a, number, of, trade, networks, that, had, been, disrupted, during, the, hyksos, occupation, of, egypt, during, the, second, intermediate, period, she, oversaw, the, preparations, and, funding, for, a, mission, to, the, land, of, punt, hatshepsut, s, delegation, returned, from, punt, bearing, 31, live, myrrh, trees, and, other, luxuries, such, as, frankincense, hatshepsut, would, grind, the, charred, frankincense, into, kohl, eyeliner, this, is, the, first, recorded, use, of, the, resin, hatshepsut, had, the, expedition, commemorated, in, relief, at, deir, el, bahari, which, is, also, famous, for, its, realistic, depiction, of, queen, ati, of, the, land, of, punt, hatshepsut, also, sent, raiding, expeditions, to, byblos, and, the, sinai, peninsula, shortly, after, the, punt, expedition, very, little, is, known, about, these, expeditions, although, many, egyptologists, have, claimed, that, her, foreign, policy, was, mainly, peaceful, it, is, possible, that, she, led, military, campaigns, against, nubia, and, canaan, hatshepsut, was, one, of, the, most, prolific, builders, in, ancient, egypt, commissioning, hundreds, of, construction, projects, throughout, both, upper, egypt, and, lower, egypt, many, of, these, building, projects, were, temples, to, build, her, religious, base, and, legitimacy, beyond, her, position, as, god, s, wife, of, amun, at, these, temples, she, performed, religious, rituals, that, had, hitherto, been, reserved, for, kings, corroborating, the, evidence, that, hatshepsut, assumed, traditionally, male, roles, as, pharaoh, she, employed, the, great, architect, ineni, who, also, had, worked, for, her, father, her, husband, and, for, the, royal, steward, senenmut, the, extant, artifacts, of, the, statuary, provide, archaeological, evidence, of, hatshepsut, s, portrayals, of, herself, as, a, male, pharaoh, with, physically, masculine, traits, and, traditionally, male, ancient, egyptian, garb, such, as, a, false, beard, and, ram, s, horns, these, images, are, seen, as, symbolic, and, not, evidence, of, cross, dressing, or, androgyny, following, the, tradition, of, most, pharaohs, hatshepsut, had, monuments, constructed, at, the, temple, of, karnak, she, also, restored, the, original, precinct, of, mut, the, great, ancient, goddess, of, egypt, at, karnak, that, had, been, ravaged, by, the, foreign, rulers, during, the, hyksos, occupation, it, later, was, ravaged, by, other, pharaohs, who, took, one, part, after, another, to, use, in, their, own, projects, the, precinct, awaits, restoration, she, had, twin, obelisks, erected, at, the, entrance, to, the, temple, which, at, the, time, of, building, were, the, tallest, in, the, world, only, one, remains, upright, which, is, the, second, tallest, ancient, obelisk, still, standing, the, other, having, toppled, and, broken, in, two, the, official, in, charge, of, those, obelisks, was, the, high, steward, amenhotep, another, project, karnak, s, red, chapel, or, chapelle, rouge, was, built, as, a, barque, shrine, later, she, ordered, the, construction, of, two, more, obelisks, to, celebrate, her, 16th, year, as, pharaoh, one, of, the, obelisks, broke, during, construction, and, a, third, was, therefore, constructed, to, replace, it, the, broken, obelisk, was, left, at, its, quarrying, site, in, aswan, where, it, remains, known, as, the, unfinished, obelisk, it, provides, evidence, of, how, obelisks, were, quarried, hatshepsut, built, the, temple, of, pakhet, at, beni, hasan, in, the, minya, governorate, south, of, al, minya, the, name, pakhet, was, a, synthesis, that, occurred, by, combining, bast, and, sekhmet, who, were, similar, lioness, war, goddesses, in, an, area, that, bordered, the, north, and, south, division, of, their, cults, the, cavernous, underground, temple, cut, into, the, rock, cliffs, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, nile, was, admired, and, called, the, speos, artemidos, by, the, greeks, during, their, occupation, of, egypt, known, as, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, they, saw, the, goddess, as, akin, to, their, hunter, goddess, artemis, the, temple, is, thought, to, have, been, built, alongside, much, more, ancient, ones, that, have, not, survived, this, temple, has, an, architrave, with, a, long, dedicatory, text, bearing, hatshepsut, s, famous, denunciation, of, the, hyksos, that, james, p, allen, has, translated, this, temple, was, altered, later, and, some, of, its, insides, were, altered, by, seti, i, of, the, nineteenth, dynasty, in, an, attempt, to, have, his, name, replace, that, of, hatshepsut, following, the, tradition, of, many, pharaohs, the, masterpiece, of, hatshepsut, s, building, projects, was, a, mortuary, temple, she, built, hers, in, a, complex, at, deir, el, bahari, the, identity, of, the, architect, behind, the, project, remains, unclear, it, is, possible, that, senenmut, the, overseer, of, works, or, hapuseneb, the, high, priest, was, responsible, it, is, also, likely, that, hatshepsut, provided, input, to, the, project, located, opposite, the, city, of, luxor, it, is, considered, to, be, a, masterpiece, of, ancient, architecture, the, complex, s, focal, point, was, the, djeser, djeseru, or, the, holy, of, holies, hyperbole, is, common, to, virtually, all, royal, inscriptions, of, egyptian, history, while, all, ancient, leaders, used, it, to, laud, their, achievements, hatshepsut, has, been, called, the, most, accomplished, pharaoh, at, promoting, her, accomplishments, hatshepsut, assumed, all, the, regalia, and, symbols, of, the, pharaonic, office, in, official, representations, the, khat, head, cloth, topped, with, the, uraeus, the, traditional, false, beard, and, shendyt, kilt, hatshepsut, was, ambiguous, and, androgynous, in, many, of, her, statues, and, monuments, she, would, create, a, masculine, version, of, herself, to, establish, herself, in, the, egyptian, patriarchy, osirian, statues, of, hatshepsut, as, with, other, pharaohs, depict, the, dead, pharaoh, as, osiris, with, the, body, and, regalia, of, that, deity, to, further, lay, her, claim, to, the, throne, priests, told, a, story, of, divine, birth, in, this, myth, amun, goes, to, ahmose, in, the, form, of, thutmose, i, hatshepsut, is, conceived, by, ahmose, khnum, the, god, who, forms, the, bodies, of, human, children, is, then, instructed, to, create, a, body, and, ka, or, corporal, presence, life, force, for, hatshepsut, heket, the, goddess, of, life, and, fertility, and, khnum, then, lead, ahmose, along, to, a, place, where, she, gives, birth, to, hatshepsut, reliefs, depicting, each, step, in, these, events, are, at, karnak, and, in, her, mortuary, temple, the, oracle, of, amun, proclaimed, that, it, was, the, will, of, amun, that, hatshepsut, be, pharaoh, further, strengthening, her, position, she, reiterated, amun, s, support, by, having, these, proclamations, by, the, god, amun, carved, on, her, monuments, welcome, my, sweet, daughter, my, favorite, the, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, maatkare, hatshepsut, thou, art, the, pharaoh, taking, possession, of, the, two, lands, once, she, became, pharaoh, herself, hatshepsut, supported, her, assertion, that, she, was, her, father, s, designated, successor, with, inscriptions, on, the, walls, of, her, mortuary, temple, then, his, majesty, said, to, them, this, daughter, of, mine, khnumetamun, hatshepsut, may, she, live, i, have, appointed, as, my, successor, upon, my, throne, she, shall, direct, the, people, in, every, sphere, of, the, palace, it, is, she, indeed, who, shall, lead, you, obey, her, words, unite, yourselves, at, her, command, the, royal, nobles, the, dignitaries, and, the, leaders, of, the, people, heard, this, proclamation, of, the, promotion, of, his, daughter, the, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, maatkare, may, she, live, eternally, hatshepsut, s, last, dated, attestation, as, pharaoh, is, year, 20, iii, peret, day, 2, c, 22, may, 1459, bc, but, the, reign, length, of, 21, years, and, 9, months, for, her, by, manetho, in, josephus, s, book, contra, apionem, indicates, that, she, ceased, to, reign, in, year, 22, c, 1458, bc, the, precise, date, of, the, beginning, of, thutmose, iii, s, reign, as, sole, ruler, of, egypt, and, presumably, of, hatshepsut, s, death, is, considered, to, be, year, 22, ii, peret, day, 10, recorded, on, a, single, stela, erected, at, armant, corresponding, to, 16, january, 1458, bc, this, information, validates, the, basic, reliability, of, manetho, s, king, list, records, since, hatshepsut, s, known, accession, date, was, i, shemu, day, 4, hatshepsut, began, constructing, a, tomb, when, she, was, the, great, royal, wife, of, thutmose, ii, still, the, scale, of, this, was, not, suitable, for, a, pharaoh, so, when, she, ascended, the, throne, preparation, for, another, burial, started, for, this, kv20, originally, quarried, for, her, father, thutmose, i, and, probably, the, first, royal, tomb, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, was, extended, with, a, new, burial, chamber, hatshepsut, also, refurbished, her, father, s, burial, and, prepared, for, a, double, interment, of, both, thutmose, i, and, her, within, kv20, therefore, it, is, likely, that, when, she, died, no, later, than, the, 22nd, year, of, her, reign, she, was, interred, in, this, tomb, along, with, her, father, however, during, thutmose, iii, s, reign, a, new, tomb, kv38, was, constructed, along, with, fresh, burial, equipment, for, thutmose, i, thus, thutmose, i, was, relocated, from, his, original, tomb, and, reburied, elsewhere, there, is, a, possibility, that, at, the, same, time, hatshepsut, s, mummy, was, moved, into, the, tomb, of, her, nurse, sitre, in, in, kv60, these, actions, could, have, been, motivated, by, amenhotep, ii, thutmose, iii, s, son, from, a, secondary, wife, in, an, effort, to, secure, his, own, uncertain, claim, to, the, throne, besides, what, was, recovered, from, kv20, during, egyptologist, howard, carter, s, clearance, of, the, tomb, in, 1903, other, funerary, furniture, belonging, to, hatshepsut, has, been, found, elsewhere, including, a, lioness, throne, or, bedstead, a, senet, game, board, with, carved, lioness, headed, red, jasper, game, pieces, bearing, her, pharaonic, title, a, signet, ring, and, a, partial, shabti, figurine, bearing, her, name, in, the, royal, mummy, cache, at, db320, a, wooden, canopic, box, featuring, an, ivory, knob, was, found, bearing, the, name, of, hatshepsut, and, containing, a, mummified, liver, or, spleen, along, with, a, molar, tooth, there, was, also, a, royal, lady, with, the, same, name, from, the, 21st, dynasty, leading, to, initial, speculation, that, the, artifacts, may, have, belonged, to, her, instead, in, 1903, howard, carter, had, discovered, tomb, kv60, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, it, contained, two, female, mummies, one, identified, as, hatshepsut, s, wet, nurse, and, the, other, unidentified, in, spring, 2007, the, unidentified, body, called, kv60a, was, finally, removed, from, the, tomb, by, dr, zahi, hawass, and, taken, to, cairo, s, egyptian, museum, for, testing, this, mummy, was, missing, a, tooth, and, the, space, in, the, jaw, perfectly, matched, hatshepsut, s, existing, molar, found, in, the, db320, canopic, box, based, on, this, hawass, concluded, that, the, kv60a, mummy, is, very, likely, hatshepsut, while, the, mummy, and, the, tooth, could, be, dna, tested, to, see, if, it, belonged, to, the, same, person, and, confirm, the, mummy, s, identity, hawass, the, cairo, museum, and, some, egyptologists, have, refused, to, do, it, as, it, would, require, destroying, the, tooth, to, retrieve, the, dna, her, death, has, since, been, attributed, to, a, benzopyrene, carcinogenic, skin, lotion, found, in, possession, of, the, pharaoh, which, led, to, her, having, bone, cancer, other, members, of, the, queen, s, family, are, thought, to, have, suffered, from, inflammatory, skin, diseases, that, tend, to, be, genetic, assuming, that, the, mummy, is, that, of, hatshepsut, it, is, likely, that, she, inadvertently, poisoned, herself, while, trying, to, soothe, her, itchy, irritated, skin, it, also, would, suggest, that, she, had, arthritis, and, bad, teeth, which, may, be, why, the, tooth, was, removed, however, in, 2011, the, tooth, was, identified, as, the, molar, from, a, lower, jaw, whereas, the, mummy, from, kv60, was, missing, a, molar, from, its, upper, jaw, thus, casting, doubt, on, the, supposed, identification, toward, the, end, of, the, reign, of, thutmose, iii, and, into, the, reign, of, his, son, an, attempt, was, made, to, remove, hatshepsut, from, certain, historical, and, pharaonic, records, her, cartouches, and, images, were, chiselled, off, stone, walls, erasure, methods, ranged, from, full, destruction, of, any, instance, of, her, name, or, image, to, replacement, inserting, thutmose, i, or, ii, where, hatshepsut, once, stood, there, were, also, instances, of, smoothing, patchwork, jobs, that, covered, hatshepsut, s, cartouche, examples, of, this, can, be, seen, on, the, walls, of, the, deir, el, bahari, temple, simpler, methods, also, included, covering, where, new, stone, was, added, to, fully, cover, reliefs, or, sacred, stone, work, at, the, deir, el, bahari, temple, hatshepsut, s, many, statues, were, torn, down, and, in, many, cases, smashed, or, disfigured, before, being, buried, in, a, pit, at, karnak, an, attempt, was, made, to, wall, up, her, monuments, while, it, is, clear, that, much, of, this, rewriting, of, hatshepsut, s, history, occurred, only, during, the, close, of, thutmose, iii, s, reign, it, is, not, clear, why, it, happened, other, than, as, a, manifestation, of, the, typical, pattern, of, self, promotion, that, existed, among, the, pharaohs, and, their, administrators, or, perhaps, to, save, money, by, not, building, new, monuments, for, the, burial, of, thutmose, iii, and, instead, using, the, grand, structures, built, by, hatshepsut, amenhotep, ii, the, son, of, thutmose, iii, who, became, a, co, regent, toward, the, end, of, his, father, s, reign, is, suspected, by, some, as, being, the, defacer, during, the, end, of, the, reign, of, a, very, old, pharaoh, he, would, have, had, a, motive, because, his, position, in, the, royal, lineage, was, not, so, strong, as, to, assure, his, elevation, to, pharaoh, he, is, documented, further, as, having, usurped, many, of, hatshepsut, s, accomplishments, during, his, own, reign, his, reign, is, marked, with, attempts, to, break, the, royal, lineage, as, well, not, recording, the, names, of, his, queens, and, eliminating, the, powerful, titles, and, official, roles, of, royal, women, such, as, god, s, wife, of, amun, some, of, these, titles, would, be, restored, in, the, reign, of, his, son, thutmose, iv, for, many, years, presuming, that, it, was, thutmose, iii, acting, out, of, resentment, once, he, became, pharaoh, early, modern, egyptologists, presumed, that, the, erasures, were, similar, to, the, roman, damnatio, memoriae, egyptologist, donald, redford, says, that, this, was, not, borne, out, of, hatred, but, was, a, political, necessity, to, assert, his, own, beliefs, redford, added, but, did, thutmose, remember, her, here, and, there, in, the, dark, recesses, of, a, shrine, or, tomb, where, no, plebeian, eye, could, see, the, queen, s, cartouche, and, figure, were, left, intact, which, never, vulgar, eye, would, again, behold, still, conveyed, for, the, king, the, warmth, and, awe, of, a, divine, presence, hatshepsut, is, according, to, egyptologist, james, henry, breasted, the, first, great, woman, in, history, of, whom, we, are, informed, in, some, ways, hatshepsut, s, reign, was, seen, as, going, against, the, patriarchal, system, of, her, time, she, managed, to, rule, as, regent, for, a, son, who, was, not, her, own, going, against, the, system, which, had, previously, only, allowed, mothers, to, rule, on, behalf, of, their, biological, sons, she, used, this, regency, to, create, her, female, kingship, constructing, extensive, temples, to, celebrate, her, reign, which, meant, that, the, public, became, used, to, seeing, a, woman, in, such, a, powerful, role, this, ensured, that, when, the, oracle, declared, her, king, the, egyptian, public, readily, accepted, her, status, however, as, with, other, female, heads, of, state, in, ancient, egypt, this, was, only, done, through, the, use, of, male, symbols, of, kingship, hence, the, description, of, hatshepsut, and, others, as, female, kings, rather, than, queens, hatshepsut, was, arguably, placed, in, power, by, men, to, further, their, own, wealth, she, gained, power, when, egypt, had, recently, amassed, extensive, wealth, implying, that, she, was, placed, in, power, by, egyptian, elites, due, to, her, record, as, successful, in, various, domains, as, high, priestess, or, as, a, placeholder, serving, for, her, father, thutmose, i, in, thebes, while, he, was, away, on, military, campaigns, this, record, of, success, made, such, elites, confident, that, she, could, handle, egyptian, wealth, and, trade, capitalizing, on, egypt, s, moment, of, prosperity, indeed, historian, kara, cooney, describes, hatshepsut, as, arguably, the, only, woman, to, have, ever, taken, power, as, king, in, ancient, egypt, during, a, time, of, prosperity, and, expansion, historian, joyce, tyldesley, stated, that, thutmose, iii, may, have, ordered, public, monuments, to, hatshepsut, and, her, achievements, to, be, altered, or, destroyed, in, order, to, place, her, in, a, lower, position, of, co, regent, meaning, he, could, claim, that, royal, succession, ran, directly, from, thutmose, ii, to, thutmose, iii, without, any, interference, from, his, aunt, this, was, supported, by, thutmose, iii, s, officials, and, as, hatshepsut, s, officials, either, died, or, were, no, longer, in, the, public, eye, there, was, little, opposition, to, this, tyldesley, along, with, historians, peter, dorman,
