immediately, calmed, him, nils, spent, much, time, in, his, garden, and, often, showed, flowers, to, linnaeus, and, told, him, their, names, soon, linnaeus, was, given, his, own, patch, of, earth, where, he, could, grow, plants, carl, s, father, was, the, first, in, his, ancestry, to, adopt, a, permanent, surname, before, that, ancestors, had, used, the, patronymic, naming, system, of,

when, carl, was, born, he, was, named, carl, linn, us, with, his, father, s, family, name, the, son, also, always, spelled, it, with, the, ligature, both, in, handwritten, documents, and, in, publications, carl, s, patronymic, would, have, been, nilsson, as, in, carl, nilsson, linn, us, linnaeus, s, father, began, teaching, him, basic, latin, religion, and, geography, at, an, early, age, when, linnaeus, was, seven, nils, decided, to, hire, a, tutor, for, him, the, parents, picked, johan, telander, a, son, of, a, local, yeoman, linnaeus, did, not, like, him, writing, in, his, autobiography, that, telander, was, better, calculated, to, extinguish, a, child, s, talents, than, develop, them, two, years, after, his, tutoring, had, begun, he, was, sent, to, the, lower, grammar, school, at, v, xj, in, 1717, linnaeus, rarely, studied, often, going, to, the, countryside, to, look, for, plants, at, some, point, his, father, went, to, visit, him, and, after, hearing, critical, assessments, by, his, preceptors, he, decided, to, put, the, youth, as, an, apprentice, to, some, honest, cobbler, he, reached, the, last, year, of, the, lower, school, when, he, was, fifteen, which, was, taught, by, the, headmaster, daniel, lannerus, who, was, interested, in, botany, lannerus, noticed, linnaeus, s, interest, in, botany, and, gave, him, the, run, of, his, garden, he, also, introduced, him, to, johan, rothman, the, state, doctor, of, sm, land, and, a, teacher, at, katedralskolan, a, gymnasium, in, v, xj, also, a, botanist, rothman, broadened, linnaeus, s, interest, in, botany, and, helped, him, develop, an, interest, in, medicine, by, the, age, of, 17, linnaeus, had, become, well, acquainted, with, the, existing, botanical, literature, he, remarks, in, his, journal, that, he, read, day, and, night, knowing, like, the, back, of, my, hand, arvidh, m, nsson, s, rydaholm, book, of, herbs, tillandz, s, flora, boensis, palmberg, s, serta, florea, suecana, bromelii, s, chloros, gothica, and, rudbeckii, s, hortus, upsaliensis, linnaeus, entered, the, v, xj, katedralskola, in, 1724, where, he, studied, mainly, greek, hebrew, theology, and, mathematics, a, curriculum, designed, for, boys, preparing, for, the, priesthood, in, the, last, year, at, the, gymnasium, linnaeus, s, father, visited, to, ask, the, professors, how, his, son, s, studies, were, progressing, to, his, dismay, most, said, that, the, boy, would, never, become, a, scholar, rothman, believed, otherwise, suggesting, linnaeus, could, have, a, future, in, medicine, the, doctor, offered, to, have, linnaeus, live, with, his, family, in, v, xj, and, to, teach, him, physiology, and, botany, nils, accepted, this, offer, rothman, showed, linnaeus, that, botany, was, a, serious, subject, he, taught, linnaeus, to, classify, plants, according, to, tournefort, s, system, linnaeus, was, also, taught, about, the, sexual, reproduction, of, plants, according, to, s, bastien, vaillant, in, 1727, linnaeus, age, 21, enrolled, in, lund, university, in, sk, ne, he, was, registered, as, carolus, linn, us, the, latin, form, of, his, full, name, which, he, also, used, later, for, his, latin, publications, professor, kilian, stob, us, natural, scientist, physician, and, historian, offered, linnaeus, tutoring, and, lodging, as, well, as, the, use, of, his, library, which, included, many, books, about, botany, he, also, gave, the, student, free, admission, to, his, lectures, in, his, spare, time, linnaeus, explored, the, flora, of, sk, ne, together, with, students, sharing, the, same, interests, in, august, 1728, linnaeus, decided, to, attend, uppsala, university, on, the, advice, of, rothman, who, believed, it, would, be, a, better, choice, if, linnaeus, wanted, to, study, both, medicine, and, botany, rothman, based, this, recommendation, on, the, two, professors, who, taught, at, the, medical, faculty, at, uppsala, olof, rudbeck, the, younger, and, lars, roberg, although, rudbeck, and, roberg, had, undoubtedly, been, good, professors, by, then, they, were, older, and, not, so, interested, in, teaching, rudbeck, no, longer, gave, public, lectures, and, had, others, stand, in, for, him, the, botany, zoology, pharmacology, and, anatomy, lectures, were, not, in, their, best, state, in, uppsala, linnaeus, met, a, new, benefactor, olof, celsius, who, was, a, professor, of, theology, and, an, amateur, botanist, he, received, linnaeus, into, his, home, and, allowed, him, use, of, his, library, which, was, one, of, the, richest, botanical, libraries, in, sweden, in, 1729, linnaeus, wrote, a, thesis, praeludia, sponsaliorum, plantarum, on, plant, sexual, reproduction, this, attracted, the, attention, of, rudbeck, in, may, 1730, he, selected, linnaeus, to, give, lectures, at, the, university, although, the, young, man, was, only, a, second, year, student, his, lectures, were, popular, and, linnaeus, often, addressed, an, audience, of, 300, people, in, june, linnaeus, moved, from, celsius, s, house, to, rudbeck, s, to, become, the, tutor, of, the, three, youngest, of, his, 24, children, his, friendship, with, celsius, did, not, wane, and, they, continued, their, botanical, expeditions, over, that, winter, linnaeus, began, to, doubt, tournefort, s, system, of, classification, and, decided, to, create, one, of, his, own, his, plan, was, to, divide, the, plants, by, the, number, of, stamens, and, pistils, he, began, writing, several, books, which, would, later, result, in, for, example, genera, plantarum, and, critica, botanica, he, also, produced, a, book, on, the, plants, grown, in, the, uppsala, botanical, garden, adonis, uplandicus, rudbeck, s, former, assistant, nils, ros, n, returned, to, the, university, in, march, 1731, with, a, degree, in, medicine, ros, n, started, giving, anatomy, lectures, and, tried, to, take, over, linnaeus, s, botany, lectures, but, rudbeck, prevented, that, until, december, ros, n, gave, linnaeus, private, tutoring, in, medicine, in, december, linnaeus, had, a, disagreement, with, rudbeck, s, wife, and, had, to, move, out, of, his, mentor, s, house, his, relationship, with, rudbeck, did, not, appear, to, suffer, that, christmas, linnaeus, returned, home, to, stenbrohult, to, visit, his, parents, for, the, first, time, in, about, three, years, his, mother, had, disapproved, of, his, failing, to, become, a, priest, but, she, was, pleased, to, learn, he, was, teaching, at, the, university, during, a, visit, with, his, parents, linnaeus, told, them, about, his, plan, to, travel, to, lapland, rudbeck, had, made, the, journey, in, 1695, but, the, detailed, results, of, his, exploration, were, lost, in, a, fire, seven, years, afterwards, linnaeus, s, hope, was, to, find, new, plants, animals, and, possibly, valuable, minerals, he, was, also, curious, about, the, customs, of, the, native, sami, people, reindeer, herding, nomads, who, wandered, scandinavia, s, vast, tundras, in, april, 1732, linnaeus, was, awarded, a, grant, from, the, royal, society, of, sciences, in, uppsala, for, his, journey, linnaeus, began, his, expedition, from, uppsala, on, 12, may, 1732, just, before, he, turned, 25, he, travelled, on, foot, and, horse, bringing, with, him, his, journal, botanical, and, ornithological, manuscripts, and, sheets, of, paper, for, pressing, plants, near, g, vle, he, found, great, quantities, of, campanula, serpyllifolia, later, known, as, linnaea, borealis, the, twinflower, that, would, become, his, favourite, he, sometimes, dismounted, on, the, way, to, examine, a, flower, or, rock, and, was, particularly, interested, in, mosses, and, lichens, the, latter, a, main, part, of, the, diet, of, the, reindeer, a, common, and, economically, important, animal, in, lapland, linnaeus, travelled, clockwise, around, the, coast, of, the, gulf, of, bothnia, making, major, inland, incursions, from, ume, lule, and, tornio, he, returned, from, his, six, month, long, over, 2, 000, kilometres, 1, 200, mi, expedition, in, october, having, gathered, and, observed, many, plants, birds, and, rocks, although, lapland, was, a, region, with, limited, biodiversity, linnaeus, described, about, 100, previously, unidentified, plants, these, became, the, basis, of, his, book, flora, lapponica, however, on, the, expedition, to, lapland, linnaeus, used, latin, names, to, describe, organisms, because, he, had, not, yet, developed, the, binomial, system, in, flora, lapponica, linnaeus, s, ideas, about, nomenclature, and, classification, were, first, used, in, a, practical, way, making, this, the, first, proto, modern, flora, the, account, covered, 534, species, used, the, linnaean, classification, system, and, included, for, the, described, species, geographical, distribution, and, taxonomic, notes, it, was, augustin, pyramus, de, candolle, who, attributed, linnaeus, with, flora, lapponica, as, the, first, example, in, the, botanical, genre, of, flora, writing, botanical, historian, e, l, greene, described, flora, lapponica, as, the, most, classic, and, delightful, of, linnaeus, s, works, it, was, during, this, expedition, that, linnaeus, had, a, flash, of, insight, regarding, the, classification, of, mammals, upon, observing, the, lower, jawbone, of, a, horse, at, the, side, of, a, road, he, was, travelling, linnaeus, remarked, if, i, only, knew, how, many, teeth, and, of, what, kind, every, animal, had, how, many, teats, and, where, they, were, placed, i, should, perhaps, be, able, to, work, out, a, perfectly, natural, system, for, the, arrangement, of, all, quadrupeds, in, 1734, linnaeus, led, a, small, group, of, students, to, dalarna, funded, by, the, governor, of, dalarna, the, expedition, was, to, catalogue, known, natural, resources, and, discover, new, ones, but, also, to, gather, intelligence, on, norwegian, mining, activities, at, r, ros, his, relations, with, nils, ros, n, having, worsened, linnaeus, accepted, an, invitation, from, claes, sohlberg, son, of, a, mining, inspector, to, spend, the, christmas, holiday, in, falun, where, linnaeus, was, permitted, to, visit, the, mines, in, april, 1735, at, the, suggestion, of, sohlberg, s, father, linnaeus, and, sohlberg, set, out, for, the, dutch, republic, where, linnaeus, intended, to, study, medicine, at, the, university, of, harderwijk, while, tutoring, sohlberg, in, exchange, for, an, annual, salary, at, the, time, it, was, common, for, swedes, to, pursue, doctoral, degrees, in, the, netherlands, then, a, highly, revered, place, to, study, natural, history, on, the, way, the, pair, stopped, in, hamburg, where, they, met, the, mayor, who, proudly, showed, them, a, supposed, wonder, of, nature, in, his, possession, the, taxidermied, remains, of, a, seven, headed, hydra, linnaeus, quickly, discovered, the, specimen, was, a, fake, cobbled, together, from, the, jaws, and, paws, of, weasels, and, the, skins, of, snakes, the, provenance, of, the, hydra, suggested, to, linnaeus, that, it, had, been, manufactured, by, monks, to, represent, the, beast, of, revelation, even, at, the, risk, of, incurring, the, mayor, s, wrath, linnaeus, made, his, observations, public, dashing, the, mayor, s, dreams, of, selling, the, hydra, for, an, enormous, sum, linnaeus, and, sohlberg, were, forced, to, flee, from, hamburg, linnaeus, began, working, towards, his, degree, as, soon, as, he, reached, harderwijk, a, university, known, for, awarding, degrees, in, as, little, as, a, week, he, submitted, a, dissertation, written, back, in, sweden, entitled, dissertatio, medica, inauguralis, in, qua, exhibetur, hypothesis, nova, de, febrium, intermittentium, causa, in, which, he, laid, out, his, hypothesis, that, malaria, arose, only, in, areas, with, clay, rich, soils, although, he, failed, to, identify, the, true, source, of, disease, transmission, i, e, the, anopheles, mosquito, he, did, correctly, predict, that, artemisia, annua, wormwood, would, become, a, source, of, antimalarial, medications, within, two, weeks, he, had, completed, his, oral, and, practical, examinations, and, was, awarded, a, doctoral, degree, that, summer, linnaeus, reunited, with, peter, artedi, a, friend, from, uppsala, with, whom, he, had, once, made, a, pact, that, should, either, of, the, two, predecease, the, other, the, survivor, would, finish, the, decedent, s, work, ten, weeks, later, artedi, drowned, in, the, canals, of, amsterdam, leaving, behind, an, unfinished, manuscript, on, the, classification, of, fish, one, of, the, first, scientists, linnaeus, met, in, the, netherlands, was, johan, frederik, gronovius, to, whom, linnaeus, showed, one, of, the, several, manuscripts, he, had, brought, with, him, from, sweden, the, manuscript, described, a, new, system, for, classifying, plants, when, gronovius, saw, it, he, was, very, impressed, and, offered, to, help, pay, for, the, printing, with, an, additional, monetary, contribution, by, the, scottish, doctor, isaac, lawson, the, manuscript, was, published, as, systema, naturae, 1735, linnaeus, became, acquainted, with, one, of, the, most, respected, physicians, and, botanists, in, the, netherlands, herman, boerhaave, who, tried, to, convince, linnaeus, to, make, a, career, there, boerhaave, offered, him, a, journey, to, south, africa, and, america, but, linnaeus, declined, stating, he, would, not, stand, the, heat, instead, boerhaave, convinced, linnaeus, that, he, should, visit, the, botanist, johannes, burman, after, his, visit, burman, impressed, with, his, guest, s, knowledge, decided, linnaeus, should, stay, with, him, during, the, winter, during, his, stay, linnaeus, helped, burman, with, his, thesaurus, zeylanicus, burman, also, helped, linnaeus, with, the, books, on, which, he, was, working, fundamenta, botanica, and, bibliotheca, botanica, in, august, 1735, during, linnaeus, s, stay, with, burman, he, met, george, clifford, iii, a, director, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, the, owner, of, a, rich, botanical, garden, at, the, estate, of, hartekamp, in, heemstede, clifford, was, very, impressed, with, linnaeus, s, ability, to, classify, plants, and, invited, him, to, become, his, physician, and, superintendent, of, his, garden, linnaeus, had, already, agreed, to, stay, with, burman, over, the, winter, and, could, thus, not, accept, immediately, however, clifford, offered, to, compensate, burman, by, offering, him, a, copy, of, sir, hans, sloane, s, natural, history, of, jamaica, a, rare, book, if, he, let, linnaeus, stay, with, him, and, burman, accepted, on, 24, september, 1735, linnaeus, moved, to, hartekamp, to, become, personal, physician, to, clifford, and, curator, of, clifford, s, herbarium, he, was, paid, 1, 000, florins, a, year, with, free, board, and, lodging, though, the, agreement, was, only, for, a, winter, of, that, year, linnaeus, practically, stayed, there, until, 1738, it, was, here, that, he, wrote, a, book, hortus, cliffortianus, in, the, preface, of, which, he, described, his, experience, as, the, happiest, time, of, my, life, a, portion, of, hartekamp, was, declared, as, public, garden, in, april, 1956, by, the, heemstede, local, authority, and, was, named, linnaeushof, it, eventually, became, as, it, is, claimed, the, biggest, playground, in, europe, in, july, 1736, linnaeus, travelled, to, england, at, clifford, s, expense, he, went, to, london, to, visit, sir, hans, sloane, a, collector, of, natural, history, and, to, see, his, cabinet, as, well, as, to, visit, the, chelsea, physic, garden, and, its, keeper, philip, miller, he, taught, miller, about, his, new, system, of, subdividing, plants, as, described, in, systema, naturae, at, first, miller, was, reluctant, to, use, the, new, binomial, nomenclature, preferring, instead, the, classifications, of, joseph, pitton, de, tournefort, and, john, ray, nevertheless, linnaeus, applauded, miller, s, gardeners, dictionary, the, conservative, miller, actually, retained, in, his, dictionary, a, number, of, pre, linnaean, binomial, signifiers, discarded, by, linnaeus, but, which, have, been, retained, by, modern, botanists, he, only, fully, changed, to, the, linnaean, system, in, the, edition, of, the, gardeners, dictionary, of, 1768, miller, ultimately, was, impressed, and, from, then, on, started, to, arrange, the, garden, according, to, linnaeus, s, system, linnaeus, also, travelled, to, oxford, university, to, visit, the, botanist, johann, jacob, dillenius, he, failed, to, make, dillenius, publicly, fully, accept, his, new, classification, system, though, the, two, men, remained, in, correspondence, for, many, years, afterwards, linnaeus, dedicated, his, critica, botanica, to, him, as, opus, botanicum, quo, absolutius, mundus, non, vidit, linnaeus, would, later, name, a, genus, of, tropical, tree, dillenia, in, his, honour, he, then, returned, to, hartekamp, bringing, with, him, many, specimens, of, rare, plants, the, next, year, 1737, he, published, genera, plantarum, in, which, he, described, 935, genera, of, plants, and, shortly, thereafter, he, supplemented, it, with, corollarium, generum, plantarum, with, another, sixty, sexaginta, genera, his, work, at, hartekamp, led, to, another, book, hortus, cliffortianus, a, catalogue, of, the, botanical, holdings, in, the, herbarium, and, botanical, garden, of, hartekamp, he, wrote, it, in, nine, months, completed, in, july, 1737, but, it, was, not, published, until, 1738, it, contains, the, first, use, of, the, name, nepenthes, which, linnaeus, used, to, describe, a, genus, of, pitcher, plants, linnaeus, stayed, with, clifford, at, hartekamp, until, 18, october, 1737, new, style, when, he, left, the, house, to, return, to, sweden, illness, and, the, kindness, of, dutch, friends, obliged, him, to, stay, some, months, longer, in, holland, in, may, 1738, he, set, out, for, sweden, again, on, the, way, home, he, stayed, in, paris, for, about, a, month, visiting, botanists, such, as, antoine, de, jussieu, after, his, return, linnaeus, never, again, left, sweden, when, linnaeus, returned, to, sweden, on, 28, june, 1738, he, went, to, falun, where, he, entered, into, an, engagement, to, sara, elisabeth, mor, a, three, months, later, he, moved, to, stockholm, to, find, employment, as, a, physician, and, thus, to, make, it, possible, to, support, a, family, once, again, linnaeus, found, a, patron, he, became, acquainted, with, count, carl, gustav, tessin, who, helped, him, get, work, as, a, physician, at, the, admiralty, during, this, time, in, stockholm, linnaeus, helped, found, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, science, he, became, the, first, praeses, of, the, academy, by, drawing, of, lots, because, his, finances, had, improved, and, were, now, sufficient, to, support, a, family, he, received, permission, to, marry, his, fianc, e, sara, elisabeth, mor, a, their, wedding, was, held, 26, june, 1739, seventeen, months, later, sara, gave, birth, to, their, first, son, carl, two, years, later, a, daughter, elisabeth, christina, was, born, and, the, subsequent, year, sara, gave, birth, to, sara, magdalena, who, died, when, 15, days, old, sara, and, linnaeus, would, later, have, four, other, children, lovisa, sara, christina, johannes, and, sophia, in, may, 1741, linnaeus, was, appointed, professor, of, medicine, at, uppsala, university, first, with, responsibility, for, medicine, related, matters, soon, he, changed, place, with, the, other, professor, of, medicine, nils, ros, n, and, thus, was, responsible, for, the, botanical, garden, which, he, would, thoroughly, reconstruct, and, expand, botany, and, natural, history, instead, in, october, that, same, year, his, wife, and, nine, month, old, son, followed, him, to, live, in, uppsala, ten, days, after, he, was, appointed, professor, he, undertook, an, expedition, to, the, island, provinces, of, land, and, gotland, with, six, students, from, the, university, to, look, for, plants, useful, in, medicine, they, stayed, on, land, until, 21, june, then, sailed, to, visby, in, gotland, linnaeus, and, the, students, stayed, on, gotland, for, about, a, month, and, then, returned, to, uppsala, during, this, expedition, they, found, 100, previously, unrecorded, plants, the, observations, from, the, expedition, were, later, published, in, l, ndska, och, gothl, ndska, resa, written, in, swedish, like, flora, lapponica, it, contained, both, zoological, and, botanical, observations, as, well, as, observations, concerning, the, culture, in, land, and, gotland, during, the, summer, of, 1745, linnaeus, published, two, more, books, flora, suecica, and, fauna, suecica, flora, suecica, was, a, strictly, botanical, book, while, fauna, suecica, was, zoological, anders, celsius, had, created, the, temperature, scale, named, after, him, in, 1742, celsius, s, scale, was, originally, inverted, compared, to, the, way, it, is, used, today, with, water, boiling, at, 0, c, and, freezing, at, 100, c, linnaeus, was, the, one, who, inverted, the, scale, to, its, present, usage, in, 1745, in, the, summer, of, 1746, linnaeus, was, once, again, commissioned, by, the, government, to, carry, out, an, expedition, this, time, to, the, swedish, province, of, v, sterg, tland, he, set, out, from, uppsala, on, 12, june, and, returned, on, 11, august, on, the, expedition, his, primary, companion, was, erik, gustaf, lidbeck, a, student, who, had, accompanied, him, on, his, previous, journey, linnaeus, described, his, findings, from, the, expedition, in, the, book, w, stg, ta, resa, published, the, next, year, after, he, returned, from, the, journey, the, government, decided, linnaeus, should, take, on, another, expedition, to, the, southernmost, province, scania, this, journey, was, postponed, as, linnaeus, felt, too, busy, in, 1747, linnaeus, was, given, the, title, archiater, or, chief, physician, by, the, swedish, king, adolf, frederick, a, mark, of, great, respect, the, same, year, he, was, elected, member, of, the, academy, of, sciences, in, berlin, in, the, spring, of, 1749, linnaeus, could, finally, journey, to, scania, again, commissioned, by, the, government, with, him, he, brought, his, student, olof, s, derberg, on, the, way, to, scania, he, made, his, last, visit, to, his, brothers, and, sisters, in, stenbrohult, since, his, father, had, died, the, previous, year, the, expedition, was, similar, to, the, previous, journeys, in, most, aspects, but, this, time, he, was, also, ordered, to, find, the, best, place, to, grow, walnut, and, swedish, whitebeam, trees, these, trees, were, used, by, the, military, to, make, rifles, while, there, they, also, visited, the, raml, sa, mineral, spa, where, he, remarked, on, the, quality, of, its, ferruginous, water, the, journey, was, successful, and, linnaeus, s, observations, were, published, the, next, year, in, sk, nska, resa, in, 1750, linnaeus, became, rector, of, uppsala, university, starting, a, period, where, natural, sciences, were, esteemed, perhaps, the, most, important, contribution, he, made, during, his, time, at, uppsala, was, to, teach, many, of, his, students, travelled, to, various, places, in, the, world, to, collect, botanical, samples, linnaeus, called, the, best, of, these, students, his, apostles, his, lectures, were, normally, very, popular, and, were, often, held, in, the, botanical, garden, he, tried, to, teach, the, students, to, think, for, themselves, and, not, trust, anybody, not, even, him, even, more, popular, than, the, lectures, were, the, botanical, excursions, made, every, saturday, during, summer, where, linnaeus, and, his, students, explored, the, flora, and, fauna, in, the, vicinity, of, uppsala, linnaeus, published, philosophia, botanica, in, 1751, the, book, contained, a, complete, survey, of, the, taxonomy, system, he, had, been, using, in, his, earlier, works, it, also, contained, information, of, how, to, keep, a, journal, on, travels, and, how, to, maintain, a, botanical, garden, during, linnaeus, s, time, it, was, normal, for, upper, class, women, to, have, wet, nurses, for, their, babies, linnaeus, joined, an, ongoing, campaign, to, end, this, practice, in, sweden, and, promote, breast, feeding, by, mothers, in, 1752, linnaeus, published, a, thesis, along, with, frederick, lindberg, a, physician, student, based, on, their, experiences, in, the, tradition, of, the, period, this, dissertation, was, essentially, an, idea, of, the, presiding, reviewer, prases, expounded, upon, by, the, student, linnaeus, s, dissertation, was, translated, into, french, by, j, e, gilibert, in, 1770, as, la, nourrice, mar, tre, ou, dissertation, sur, les, suites, funestes, du, nourrisage, merc, naire, linnaeus, suggested, that, children, might, absorb, the, personality, of, their, wet, nurse, through, the, milk, he, admired, the, child, care, practices, of, the, lapps, and, pointed, out, how, healthy, their, babies, were, compared, to, those, of, europeans, who, employed, wet, nurses, he, compared, the, behaviour, of, wild, animals, and, pointed, out, how, none, of, them, denied, their, newborns, their, breastmilk, it, is, thought, that, his, activism, played, a, role, in, his, choice, of, the, term, mammalia, for, the, class, of, organisms, linnaeus, published, species, plantarum, the, work, which, is, now, internationally, accepted, as, the, starting, point, of, modern, botanical, nomenclature, in, 1753, the, first, volume, was, issued, on, 24, may, the, second, volume, followed, on, 16, august, of, the, same, year, the, book, contained, 1, 200, pages, and, was, published, in, two, volumes, it, described, over, 7, 300, species, the, same, year, the, king, dubbed, him, knight, of, the, order, of, the, polar, star, the, first, civilian, in, sweden, to, become, a, knight, in, this, order, he, was, then, seldom, seen, not, wearing, the, order, s, insignia, linnaeus, felt, uppsala, was, too, noisy, and, unhealthy, so, he, bought, two, farms, in, 1758, hammarby, and, s, vja, the, next, year, he, bought, a, neighbouring, farm, edeby, he, spent, the, summers, with, his, family, at, hammarby, initially, it, only, had, a, small, one, storey, house, but, in, 1762, a, new, larger, main, building, was, added, in, hammarby, linnaeus, made, a, garden, where, he, could, grow, plants, that, could, not, be, grown, in, the, botanical, garden, in, uppsala, he, began, constructing, a, museum, on, a, hill, behind, hammarby, in, 1766, where, he, moved, his, library, and, collection, of, plants, a, fire, that, destroyed, about, one, third, of, uppsala, and, had, threatened, his, residence, there, necessitated, the, move, since, the, initial, release, of, systema, naturae, in, 1735, the, book, had, been, expanded, and, reprinted, several, times, the, tenth, edition, was, released, in, 1758, this, edition, established, itself, as, the, starting, point, for, zoological, nomenclature, the, equivalent, of, species, plantarum, the, swedish, king, adolf, frederick, granted, linnaeus, nobility, in, 1757, but, he, was, not, ennobled, until, 1761, with, his, ennoblement, he, took, the, name, carl, von, linn, latinised, as, carolus, a, linn, linn, being, a, shortened, and, gallicised, version, of, linn, us, and, the, german, nobiliary, particle, von, signifying, his, ennoblement, the, noble, family, s, coat, of, arms, prominently, features, a, twinflower, one, of, linnaeus, s, favourite, plants, it, was, given, the, scientific, name, linnaea, borealis, in, his, honour, by, gronovius, the, shield, in, the, coat, of, arms, is, divided, into, thirds, red, black, and, green, for, the, three, kingdoms, of, nature, animal, mineral, and, vegetable, in, linnaean, classification, in, the, centre, is, an, egg, to, denote, nature, which, is, continued, and, perpetuated, in, ovo, at, the, bottom, is, a, phrase, in, latin, borrowed, from, the, aeneid, which, reads, famam, extendere, factis, we, extend, our, fame, by, our, deeds, linnaeus, inscribed, this, personal, motto, in, books, that, were, given, to, him, by, friends, after, his, ennoblement, linnaeus, continued, teaching, and, writing, his, reputation, had, spread, over, the, world, and, he, corresponded, with, many, different, people, for, example, catherine, ii, of, russia, sent, him, seeds, from, her, country, he, also, corresponded, with, giovanni, antonio, scopoli, the, linnaeus, of, the, austrian, empire, who, was, a, doctor, and, a, botanist, in, idrija, duchy, of, carniola, nowadays, slovenia, scopoli, communicated, all, of, his, research, findings, and, descriptions, for, example, of, the, olm, and, the, dormouse, two, little, animals, hitherto, unknown, to, linnaeus, linnaeus, greatly, respected, scopoli, and, showed, great, interest, in, his, work, he, named, a, solanaceous, genus, scopolia, the, source, of, scopolamine, after, him, but, because, of, the, great, distance, between, them, they, never, met, linnaeus, was, relieved, of, his, duties, in, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, science, in, 1763, but, continued, his, work, there, as, usual, for, more, than, ten, years, after, in, 1769, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, for, his, work, he, stepped, down, as, rector, at, uppsala, university, in, december, 1772, mostly, due, to, his, declining, health, linnaeus, s, last, years, were, troubled, by, illness, he, had, had, a, disease, called, the, uppsala, fever, in, 1764, but, survived, due, to, the, care, of, ros, n, he, developed, sciatica, in, 1773, and, the, next, year, he, had, a, stroke, which, partially, paralysed, him, he, had, a, second, stroke, in, 1776, losing, the, use, of, his, right, side, and, leaving, him, bereft, of, his, memory, while, still, able, to, admire, his, own, writings, he, could, not, recognise, himself, as, their, author, in, december, 1777, he, had, another, stroke, which, greatly, weakened, him, and, eventually, led, to, his, death, on, 10, january, 1778, in, hammarby, despite, his, desire, to, be, buried, in, hammarby, he, was, buried, in, uppsala, cathedral, on, 22, january, his, library, and, collections, were, left, to, his, widow, sara, and, their, children, joseph, banks, an, eminent, botanist, wished, to, purchase, the, collection, but, his, son, carl, refused, the, offer, and, instead, moved, the, collection, to, uppsala, in, 1783, carl, died, and, sara, inherited, the, collection, having, outlived, both, her, husband, and, son, she, tried, to, sell, it, to, banks, but, he, was, no, longer, interested, instead, an, acquaintance, of, his, agreed, to, buy, the, collection, the, acquaintance, was, a, 24, year, old, medical, student, james, edward, smith, who, bought, the, whole, collection, 14, 000, plants, 3, 198, insects, 1, 564, shells, about, 3, 000, letters, and, 1, 600, books, smith, founded, the, linnean, society, of, london, five, years, later, the, von, linn, name, ended, with, his, son, carl, who, never, married, his, other, son, johannes, had, died, aged, 3, there, are, over, two, hundred, descendants, of, linnaeus, through, two, of, his, daughters, during, linnaeus, s, time, as, professor, and, rector, of, uppsala, university, he, taught, many, devoted, students, 17, of, whom, he, called, apostles, they, were, the, most, promising, most, committed, students, and, all, of, them, made, botanical, expeditions, to, various, places, in, the, world, often, with, his, help, the, amount, of, this, help, varied, sometimes, he, used, his, influence, as, rector, to, grant, his, apostles, a, scholarship, or, a, place, on, an, expedition, to, most, of, the, apostles, he, gave, instructions, of, what, to, look, for, on, their, journeys, abroad, the, apostles, collected, and, organised, new, plants, animals, and, minerals, according, to, linnaeus, s, system, most, of, them, also, gave, some, of, their, collection, to, linnaeus, when, their, journey, was, finished, thanks, to, these, students, the, linnaean, system, of, taxonomy, spread, through, the, world, without, linnaeus, ever, having, to, travel, outside, sweden, after, his, return, from, holland, the, british, botanist, william, t, stearn, notes, without, linnaeus, s, new, system, it, would, not, have, been, possible, for, the, apostles, to, collect, and, organise, so, many, new, specimens, many, of, the, apostles, died, during, their, expeditions, christopher, t, rnstr, m, the, first, apostle, and, a, 43, year, old, pastor, with, a, wife, and, children, made, his, journey, in, 1746, he, boarded, a, swedish, east, india, company, ship, headed, for, china, t, rnstr, m, never, reached, his, destination, dying, of, a, tropical, fever, on, c, n, s, n, island, the, same, year, t, rnstr, m, s, widow, blamed, linnaeus, for, making, her, children, fatherless, causing, linnaeus, to, prefer, sending, out, younger, unmarried, students, after, t, rnstr, m, six, other, apostles, later, died, on, their, expeditions, including, pehr, forssk, l, and, pehr, l, fling, two, years, after, t, rnstr, m, s, expedition, finnish, born, pehr, kalm, set, out, as, the, second, apostle, to, north, america, there, he, spent, two, and, a, half, years, studying, the, flora, and, fauna, of, pennsylvania, new, york, new, jersey, and, canada, linnaeus, was, overjoyed, when, kalm, returned, bringing, back, with, him, many, pressed, flowers, and, seeds, at, least, 90, of, the, 700, north, american, species, described, in, species, plantarum, had, been, brought, back, by, kalm, daniel, solander, was, living, in, linnaeus, s, house, during, his, time, as, a, student, in, uppsala, linnaeus, was, very, fond, of, him, promising, solander, his, eldest, daughter, s, hand, in, marriage, on, linnaeus, s, recommendation, solander, travelled, to, england, in, 1760, where, he, met, the, english, botanist, joseph, banks, with, banks, solander, joined, james, cook, on, his, expedition, to, oceania, on, the, endeavour, in, 1768, 71, solander, was, not, the, only, apostle, to, journey, with, james, cook, anders, sparrman, followed, on, the, resolution, in, 1772, 75, bound, for, among, other, places, oceania, and, south, america, sparrman, made, many, other, expeditions, one, of, them, to, south, africa, perhaps, the, most, famous, and, successful, apostle, was, carl, peter, thunberg, who, embarked, on, a, nine, year, expedition, in, 1770, he, stayed, in, south, africa, for, three, years, then, travelled, to, japan, all, foreigners, in, japan, were, forced, to, stay, on, the, island, of, dejima, outside, nagasaki, so, it, was, thus, hard, for, thunberg, to, study, the, flora, he, did, however, manage, to, persuade, some, of, the, translators, to, bring, him, different, plants, and, he, also, found, plants, in, the, gardens, of, dejima, he, returned, to, sweden, in, 1779, one, year, after, linnaeus, s, death, the, first, edition, of, systema, naturae, was, printed, in, the, netherlands, in, 1735, it, was, a, twelve, page, work, by, the, time, it, reached, its, 10th, edition, in, 1758, it, classified, 4, 400, species, of, animals, and, 7, 700, species, of, plants, people, from, all, over, the, world, sent, their, specimens, to, linnaeus, to, be, included, by, the, time, he, started, work, on, the, 12th, edition, linnaeus, needed, a, new, invention, the, index, card, to, track, classifications, in, systema, naturae, the, unwieldy, names, mostly, used, at, the, time, such, as, physalis, annua, ramosissima, ramis, angulosis, glabris, foliis, dentato, serratis, were, supplemented, with, concise, and, now, familiar, binomials, composed, of, the, generic, name, followed, by, a, specific, epithet, in, the, case, given, physalis, angulata, these, binomials, could, serve, as, a, label, to, refer, to, the, species, higher, taxa, were, constructed, and, arranged, in, a, simple, and, orderly, manner, although, the, system, now, known, as, binomial, nomenclature, was, partially, developed, by, the, bauhin, brothers, see, gaspard, bauhin, and, johann, bauhin, almost, 200, years, earlier, linnaeus, was, the, first, to, use, it, consistently, throughout, the, work, including, in, monospecific, genera, and, may, be, said, to, have, popularised, it, within, the, scientific, community, after, the, decline, in, linnaeus, s, health, in, the, early, 1770s, publication, of, editions, of, systema, naturae, went, in, two, different, directions, another, swedish, scientist, johan, andreas, murray, issued, the, regnum, vegetabile, section, separately, in, 1774, as, the, systema, vegetabilium, rather, confusingly, labelled, the, 13th, edition, meanwhile, a, 13th, edition, of, the, entire, systema, appeared, in, parts, between, 1788, and, 1793, under, the, editorship, of, johann, friedrich, gmelin, it, was, through, the, systema, vegetabilium, that, linnaeus, s, work, became, widely, known, in, england, following, its, translation, from, the, latin, by, the, lichfield, botanical, society, as, a, system, of, vegetables, 1783, 1785, opinion, of, the, learned, world, on, the, writings, of, carl, linnaeus, doctor, published, in, 1740, this, small, octavo, sized, pamphlet, was, presented, to, the, state, library, of, new, south, wales, by, the, linnean, society, of, nsw, in, 2018, this, is, considered, among, the, rarest, of, all, the, writings, of, linnaeus, and, crucial, to, his, career, securing, him, his, appointment, to, a, professorship, of, medicine, at, uppsala, university, from, this, position, he, laid, the, groundwork, for, his, radical, new, theory, of, classifying, and, naming, organisms, for, which, he, was, considered, the, founder, of, modern, taxonomy, species, plantarum, or, more, fully, species, plantarum, exhibentes, plantas, rite, cognitas, ad, genera, relatas, cum, differentiis, specificis, nominibus, trivialibus, synonymis, selectis, locis, natalibus, secundum, systema, sexuale, digestas, was, first, published, in, 1753, as, a, two, volume, work, its, prime, importance, is, perhaps, that, it, is, the, primary, starting, point, of, plant, nomenclature, as, it, exists, today, genera, plantarum, eorumque, characteres, naturales, secundum, numerum, figuram, situm, et, proportionem, omnium, fructificationis, partium, was, first, published, in, 1737, delineating, plant, genera, around, 10, editions, were, published, not, all, of, them, by, linnaeus, himself, the, most, important, is, the, 1754, fifth, edition, in, it, linnaeus, divided, the, plant, kingdom, into, 24, classes, one, cryptogamia, included, all, the, plants, with, concealed, reproductive, parts, algae, fungi, mosses, and, liverworts, and, ferns, philosophia, botanica, 1751, was, a, summary, of, linnaeus, s, thinking, on, plant, classification, and, nomenclature, and, an, elaboration, of, the, work, he, had, previously, published, in, fundamenta, botanica, 1736, and, critica, botanica, 1737, other, publications, forming, part, of, his, plan, to, reform, the, foundations, of, botany, include, his, classes, plantarum, and, bibliotheca, botanica, all, were, printed, in, holland, as, were, genera, plantarum, 1737, and, systema, naturae, 1735, the, philosophia, being, simultaneously, released, in, stockholm, at, the, end, of, his, lifetime, the, linnean, collection, in, uppsala, was, considered, one, of, the, finest, collections, of, natural, history, objects, in, sweden, next, to, his, own, collection, he, had, also, built, up, a, museum, for, the, university, of, uppsala, which, was, supplied, by, material, donated, by, carl, gyllenborg, in, 1744, 1745, crown, prince, adolf, fredrik, in, 1745, erik, petreus, in, 1746, claes, grill, in, 1746, magnus, lagerstr, m, in, 1748, and, 1750, and, jonas, alstr, mer, in, 1749, the, relation, between, the, museum, and, the, private, collection, was, not, formalised, and, the, steady, flow, of, material, from, linnean, pupils, were, incorporated, to, the, private, collection, rather, than, to, the, museum, linnaeus, felt, his, work, was, reflecting, the, harmony, of, nature, and, he, said, in, 1754, the, earth, is, then, nothing, else, but, a, museum, of, the, all, wise, creator, s, masterpieces, divided, into, three, chambers, he, had, turned, his, own, estate, into, a, microcosm, of, that, world, museum, in, april, 1766, parts, of, the, town, were, destroyed, by, a, fire, and, the, linnean, private, collection, was, subsequently, moved, to, a, barn, outside, the, town, and, shortly, afterwards, to, a, single, room, stone, building, close, to, his, country, house, at, hammarby, near, uppsala, this, resulted, in, a, physical, separation, between, the, two, collections, the, museum, collection, remained, in, the, botanical, garden, of, the, university, some, material, which, needed, special, care, alcohol, specimens, or, ample, storage, space, was, moved, from, the, private, collection, to, the, museum, in, hammarby, the, linnean, private, collections, suffered, seriously, from, damp, and, the, depredations, by, mice, and, insects, carl, von, linn, s, son, carl, linnaeus, inherited, the, collections, in, 1778, and, retained, them, until, his, own, death, in, 1783, shortly, after, carl, von, linn, s, death, his, son, confirmed, that, mice, had, caused, horrible, damage, to, the, plants, and, that, also, moths, and, mould, had, caused, considerable, damage, he, tried, to, rescue, them, from, the, neglect, they, had, suffered, during, his, father, s, later, years, and, also, added, further, specimens, this, last, activity, however, reduced, rather, than, augmented, the, scientific, value, of, the, original, material, in, 1784, the, young, medical, student, james, edward, smith, purchased, the, entire, specimen, collection, library, manuscripts, and, correspondence, of, carl, linnaeus, from, his, widow, and, daughter, and, transferred, the, collections, to, london, not, all, material, in, linn, s, private, collection, was, transported, to, england, thirty, three, fish, specimens, preserved, in, alcohol, were, not, sent, and, were, later, lost, in, london, smith, tended, to, neglect, the, zoological, parts, of, the, collection, he, added, some, specimens, and, also, gave, some, specimens, away, over, the, following, centuries, the, linnean, collection, in, london, suffered, enormously, at, the, hands, of, scientists, who, studied, the, collection, and, in, the, process, disturbed, the, original, arrangement, and, labels, added, specimens, that, did, not, belong, to, the, original, series, and, withdrew, precious, original, type, material, much, material, which, had, been, intensively, studied, by, linn, in, his, scientific, career, belonged, to, the, collection, of, queen, lovisa, ulrika, 1720, 1782, in, the, linnean, publications, referred, to, as, museum, ludovicae, ulricae, or, m, l, u, this, collection, was, donated, by, her, grandson, king, gustav, iv, adolf, 1778, 1837, to, the, museum, in, uppsala, in, 1804, another, important, collection, in, this, respect, was, that, of, her, husband, king, adolf, fredrik, 1710, 1771, in, the, linnean, sources, known, as, museum, adolphi, friderici, or, mus, ad, fr, the, wet, parts, alcohol, collection, of, which, were, later, donated, to, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, and, is, today, housed, in, the, swedish, museum, of, natural, history, at, stockholm, the, dry, material, was, transferred, to, uppsala, the, establishment, of, universally, accepted, conventions, for, the, naming, of, organisms, was, linnaeus, s, main, contribution, to, taxonomy, his, work, marks, the, starting, point, of, consistent, use, of, binomial, nomenclature, during, the, 18th, century, expansion, of, natural, history, knowledge, linnaeus, also, developed, what, became, known, as, the, linnaean, taxonomy, the, system, of, scientific, classification, now, widely, used, in, the, biological, sciences, a, previous, zoologist, rumphius, 1627, 1702, had, more, or, less, approximated, the, linnaean, system, and, his, material, contributed, to, the, later, development, of, the, binomial, scientific, classification, by, linnaeus, the, linnaean, system, classified, nature, within, a, nested, hierarchy, starting, with, three, kingdoms, kingdoms, were, divided, into, classes, and, they, in, turn, into, orders, and, thence, into, genera, singular, genus, which, were, divided, into, species, singular, species, below, the, rank, of, species, he, sometimes, recognised, taxa, of, a, lower, unnamed, rank, these, have, since, acquired, standardised, names, such, as, variety, in, botany, and, subspecies, in, zoology, modern, taxonomy, includes, a, rank, of, family, between, order, and, genus, and, a, rank, of, phylum, between, kingdom, and, class, that, were, not, present, in, linnaeus, s, original, system, linnaeus, s, groupings, were, based, upon, shared, physical, characteristics, and, not, based, upon, differences, of, his, higher, groupings, only, those, for, animals, are, still, in, use, and, the, groupings, themselves, have, been, significantly, changed, since, their, conception, as, have, the, principles, behind, them, nevertheless, linnaeus, is, credited, with, establishing, the, idea, of, a, hierarchical, structure, of, classification, which, is, based, upon, observable, characteristics, and, intended, to, reflect, natural, relationships, while, the, underlying, details, concerning, what, are, considered, to, be, scientifically, valid, observable, characteristics, have, changed, with, expanding, knowledge, for, example, dna, sequencing, unavailable, in, linnaeus, s, time, has, proven, to, be, a, tool, of, considerable, utility, for, classifying, living, organisms, and, establishing, their, evolutionary, relationships, the, fundamental, principle, remains, sound, linnaeus, s, system, of, taxonomy, was, especially, noted, as, the, first, to, include, humans, homo, taxonomically, grouped, with, apes, simia, under, the, header, of, anthropomorpha, german, biologist, ernst, haeckel, speaking, in, 1907, noted, this, as, the, most, important, sign, of, linnaeus, s, genius, linnaeus, classified, humans, among, the, primates, beginning, with, the, first, edition, of, systema, naturae, during, his, time, at, hartekamp, he, had, the, opportunity, to, examine, several, monkeys, and, noted, similarities, between, them, and, man, he, pointed, out, both, species, basically, have, the, same, anatomy, except, for, speech, he, found, no, other, differences, thus, he, placed, man, and, monkeys, under, the, same, category, anthropomorpha, meaning, manlike, this, classification, received, criticism, from, other, biologists, such, as, johan, gottschalk, wallerius, jacob, theodor, klein, and, johann, georg, gmelin, on, the, ground, that, it, is, illogical, to, describe, man, as, human, like, in, a, letter, to, gmelin, from, 1747, linnaeus, replied, it, does, not, please, that, i, ve, placed, man, among, the, anthropomorpha, perhaps, because, of, the, term, with, human, form, but, man, learns, to, know, himself, let, s, not, quibble, over, words, it, will, be, the, same, to, me, whatever, name, we, apply, but, i, seek, from, you, and, from, the, whole, world, a, generic, difference, between, man, and, simian, that, from, the, principles, of, natural, history, i, absolutely, know, of, none, if, only, someone, might, tell, me, a, single, one, if, i, would, have, called, man, a, simian, or, vice, versa, i, would, have, brought, together, all, the, theologians, against, me, perhaps, i, ought, to, have, by, virtue, of, the, law, of, the, discipline, the, theological, concerns, were, twofold, first, putting, man, at, the, same, level, as, monkeys, or, apes, would, lower, the, spiritually, higher, position, that, man, was, assumed, to, have, in, the, great, chain, of, being, and, second, because, the, bible, says, man, was, created, in, the, image, of, god, theomorphism, if, monkeys, apes, and, humans, were, not, distinctly, and, separately, designed, that, would, mean, monkeys, and, apes, were, created, in, the, image, of, god, as, well, this, was, something, many, could, not, accept, the, conflict, between, world, views, that, was, caused, by, asserting, man, was, a, type, of, animal, would, simmer, for, a, century, until, the, much, greater, and, still, ongoing, creation, evolution, controversy, began, in, earnest, with, the, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, by, charles, darwin, in, 1859, after, such, criticism, linnaeus, felt, he, needed, to, explain, himself, more, clearly, the, 10th, edition, of, systema, naturae, introduced, new, terms, including, mammalia, and, primates, the, latter, of, which, would, replace, anthropomorpha, as, well, as, giving, humans, the, full, binomial, homo, sapiens, the, new, classification, received, less, criticism, but, many, natural, historians, still, believed, he, had, demoted, humans, from, their, former, place, of, ruling, over, nature, and, not, being, a, part, of, it, linnaeus, believed, that, man, biologically, belongs, to, the, animal, kingdom, and, had, to, be, included, in, it, in, his, book, dieta, naturalis, he, said, one, should, not, vent, one, s, wrath, on, animals, theology, decree, that, man, has, a, soul, and, that, the, animals, are, mere, automata, mechanica, but, i, believe, they, would, be, better, advised, that, animals, have, a, soul, and, that, the, difference, is, of, nobility, linnaeus, added, a, second, species, to, the, genus, homo, in, systema, naturae, based, on, a, figure, and, description, by, jacobus, bontius, from, a, 1658, publication, homo, troglodytes, caveman, and, published, a, third, in, 1771, homo, lar, swedish, historian, gunnar, broberg, states, that, the, new, human, species, linnaeus, described, were, actually, simians, or, native, people, clad, in, skins, to, frighten, colonial, settlers, whose, appearance, had, been, exaggerated, in, accounts, to, linnaeus, for, homo, troglodytes, linnaeus, asked, the, swedish, east, india, company, to, search, for, one, but, they, did, not, find, any, signs, of, its, existence, homo, lar, has, since, been, reclassified, as, hylobates, lar, the, lar, gibbon, in, the, first, edition, of, systema, naturae, linnaeus, subdivided, the, human, species, into, four, varieties, europ, us, albesc, whitish, european, americanus, rubesc, reddish, american, asiaticus, fuscus, tawny, asian, and, africanus, nigr, blackish, african, in, the, tenth, edition, of, systema, naturae, he, further, detailed, phenotypical, characteristics, for, each, variety, based, on, the, concept, of, the, four, temperaments, from, classical, antiquity, and, changed, the, description, of, asians, skin, tone, to, luridus, yellow, while, linnaeus, believed, that, these, varieties, resulted, from, environmental, differences, between, the, four, known, continents, the, linnean, society, acknowledges, that, his, categorization, s, focus, on, skin, color, and, later, inclusion, of, cultural, and, behavioral, traits, cemented, colonial, stereotypes, and, provided, the, foundations, for, scientific, racism, additionally, linnaeus, created, a, wastebasket, taxon, monstrosus, for, wild, and, monstrous, humans, unknown, groups, and, more, or, less, abnormal, people, in, 1959, w, t, stearn, designated, linnaeus, to, be, the, lectotype, of, h, sapiens, linnaeus, s, applied, science, was, inspired, not, only, by, the, instrumental, utilitarianism, general, to, the, early, enlightenment, but, also, by, his, adherence, to, the, older, economic, doctrine, of, cameralism, additionally, linnaeus, was, a, state, interventionist, he, supported, tariffs, levies, export, bounties, quotas, embargoes, navigation, acts, subsidised, investment, capital, ceilings, on, wages, cash, grants, state, licensed, producer, monopolies, and, cartels, anniversaries, of, linnaeus, s, birth, especially, in, centennial, years, have, been, marked, by, major, celebrations, linnaeus, has, appeared, on, numerous, swedish, postage, stamps, and, banknotes, there, are, numerous, statues, of, linnaeus, in, countries, around, the, world, the, linnean, society, of, london, has, awarded, the, linnean, medal, for, excellence, in, botany, or, zoology, since, 1888, following, approval, by, the, riksdag, of, sweden, v, xj, university, and, kalmar, college, merged, on, 1, january, 2010, to, become, linnaeus, university, other, things, named, after, linnaeus, include, the, twinflower, genus, linnaea, linnaeosicyos, a, monotypic, genus, in, the, family, cucurbitaceae, the, crater, linn, on, the, earth, s, moon, a, street, in, cambridge, massachusetts, and, the, cobalt, sulfide, mineral, linnaeite, linnaeus, wrote, a, description, of, himself, in, his, autobiography, egenh, ndiga, anteckningar, af, carl, linn, us, om, sig, sjelf, med, anm, rkningar, och, till, gg, which, was, published, by, his, student, adam, afzelius, in, 1823, linnaeus, was, not, big, not, small, thin, brown, eyed, light, hasty, walked, quickly, did, everything, promptly, could, not, stand, lateness, was, quickly, moved, sensitive, worked, continuously, could, not, spare, himself, he, enjoyed, good, food, drank, good, drinks, but, was, never, inebriated, by, them, he, cared, little, for, appearance, believed, that, the, man, should, embellish, the, clothes, and, not, vice, versa, he, was, certainly, not, argumentative, so, he, never, answered, those, who, wrote, against, him, and, said, if, i, am, wrong, i, will, not, win, and, if, i, am, right, i, will, be, shown, to, be, right, as, long, as, nature, exists, andrew, dickson, white, wrote, in, a, history, of, the, warfare, of, science, with, theology, in, christendom, 1896, linnaeus, was, the, most, eminent, naturalist, of, his, time, a, wide, observer, a, close, thinker, but, the, atmosphere, in, which, he, lived, and, moved, and, had, his, being, was, saturated, with, biblical, theology, and, this, permeated, all, his, thinking, toward, the, end, of, his, life, he, timidly, advanced, the, hypothesis, that, all, the, species, of, one, genus, constituted, at, the, creation, one, species, and, from, the, last, edition, of, his, systema, natur, he, quietly, left, out, the, strongly, orthodox, statement, of, the, fixity, of, each, species, which, he, had, insisted, upon, in, his, earlier, works, warnings, came, speedily, both, from, the, catholic, and, protestant, sides, the, mathematical, pagerank, algorithm, applied, to, 24, multilingual, wikipedia, editions, in, 2014, published, in, plos, one, in, 2015, placed, carl, linnaeus, at, the, top, historical, figure, above, jesus, aristotle, napoleon, and, adolf, hitler, in, that, order, in, the, 21st, century, linn, us, s, taxonomy, of, human, races, has, been, problematised, and, discussed, some, critics, claim, that, linn, us, was, one, of, the, forebears, of, the, modern, pseudoscientific, notion, of, scientific, racism, while, others, hold, the, view, that, while, his, classification, was, stereotyped, it, did, not, imply, that, certain, human, races, were, superior, to, others, the, greater, number, of, naturalists, who, have, taken, into, consideration, the, whole, structure, of, man, including, his, mental, faculties, have, followed, blumenbach, and, cuvier, and, have, placed, man, in, a, separate, order, under, the, title, of, the, bimana, and, therefore, on, an, equality, with, the, orders, of, the, quadrumana, carnivora, etc, recently, many, of, our, best, naturalists, have, recurred, to, the, view, first, propounded, by, linnaeus, so, remarkable, for, his, sagacity, and, have, placed, man, in, the, same, order, with, the, quadrumana, under, the, title, of, the, primates, the, justice, of, this, conclusion, will, be, admitted, for, in, the, first, place, we, must, bear, in, mind, the, comparative, insignificance, for, classification, of, the, great, development, of, the, brain, in, man, and, that, the, strongly, marked, differences, between, the, skulls, of, man, and, the, quadrumana, lately, insisted, upon, by, bischoff, aeby, and, others, apparently, follow, from, their, differently, developed, brains, in, the, second, place, we, must, remember, that, nearly, all, the, other, and, more, important, differences, between, man, and, the, quadrumana, are, manifestly, adaptive, in, their, nature, and, relate, chiefly, to, the, erect, position, of, man, such, as, the, structure, of, his, hand, foot, and, pelvis, the, curvature, of, his, spine, and, the, position, of, his, head, biographies, resources, other
