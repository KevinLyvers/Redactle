priority, to, army, expenditures, whether, to, build, up, its, reserves, or, to, fund, advanced, weaponry, such, as, krupp, s, siege, cannons, instead, they, preferred, to, concentrate, military, spending, on, the, imperial, german, navy, ludendorff, s, calculations, showed, that, to, properly, implement, the, schlieffen, plan, the, army, lacked, six, corps, members, of, the, general, staff, were, instructed, to, keep, out, of, politics, and, the, public, eye, but, ludendorff, shrugged, off, such, restrictions, with, a, retired, general, august, keim, and, the, head, of, the, pan, german,

character, but, who, was, deliberately, friendless, and, forbidding, and, therefore, remained, little, known, or, liked, it, is, true, that, as, his, wife, testified, anyone, who, knows, ludendorff, knows, that, he, has, not, a, spark, of, humor, he, was, voluble, nonetheless, although, he, shunned, small, talk, john, lee, states, that, while, ludendorff, was, with, his, fusiliers, he, became, the, perfect, regimental, commander, the, younger, officers, came, to, adore, him, his, adjutant, wilhelm, breucker, became, a, devoted, lifelong, friend, at, the, outbreak, of, war, in, the, summer, of, 1914, ludendorff, was, appointed, deputy, chief, of, staff, to, the, german, second, army, under, general, karl, von, b, low, his, assignment, was, largely, due, to, his, previous, work,

its, citadel, in, the, following, days, two, of, the, forts, guarding, the, city, were, taken, by, desperate, frontal, infantry, attacks, while, the, remaining, forts, were, smashed, by, huge, krupp, 42, cm, and, austro, hungarian, koda, 30, 5, cm, howitzers, by, 16, august, all, the, forts, around, li, ge, had, fallen, allowing, the, german, first, army, to, advance, as, the, victor, of, li, ge,

maximilian, von, prittwitz, with, georg, von, waldersee, as, chief, of, staff, performed, subpar, and, reportedly, panicked, they, accordingly, were, dismissed, from, command, by, the, oberste, heeresleitung, ohl, the, german, supreme, army, command, the, war, cabinet, chose, a, retired, general, paul, von, hindenburg, as, commander, while, the, ohl, assigned, ludendorff, as, his, new, chief, of, staff, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, first, met, on, their, private, train, heading, east, they, agreed, that, they, must, annihilate, the, nearest, russian, army, before, they, tackled, the, second, on, arrival, they, discovered, that, max, hoffmann, had, already, shifted, much, of, the, 8th, army, by, rail, to, the, south, to, do, just, that, in, an, amazing, feat, of, logistical, planning, nine, days, later, the, eighth, army, surrounded, most, of, a, russian, army, at, tannenberg, taking, 92, 000, prisoners, in, one, of, the, great, victories, in, german, history, twice, during, the, battle, ludendorff, wanted, to, break, off, fearing, that, the, second, russian, army, was, about, to, strike, their, rear, but, hindenburg, held, firm, the, germans, turned, on, the, second, invading, army, in, the, battle, of, the, masurian, lakes, it, fled, with, heavy, losses, to, escape, encirclement, during, the, rest, of, 1914, commanding, an, army, group, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, staved, off, the, projected, invasion, of, german, silesia, by, dexterously, moving, their, outnumbered, forces, into, russian, poland, fighting, the, battle, of, the, vistula, river, which, ended, with, a, brilliantly, executed, withdrawal, during, which, they, destroyed, the, polish, railway, lines, and, bridges, needed, for, an, invasion, when, the, russians, had, repaired, most, of, the, damage, the, germans, struck, their, flank, in, the, battle, of, d, where, they, almost, surrounded, another, russian, army, masters, of, surprise, and, deft, maneuver, the, pair, argued, that, if, properly, reinforced, they, could, trap, the, entire, russian, army, in, poland, during, the, winter, of, 1914, 15, they, lobbied, passionately, for, this, strategy, but, were, rebuffed, by, the, ohl, early, in, 1915, hindenburg, and, ludendorff, surprised, the, russian, army, that, still, held, a, toehold, in, east, prussia, by, attacking, in, a, snowstorm, and, surrounding, it, in, the, second, battle, of, the, masurian, lakes, the, ohl, then, transferred, ludendorff, but, hindenburg, s, personal, plea, to, the, kaiser, reunited, them, erich, von, falkenhayn, supreme, commander, at, the, ohl, came, east, to, attack, the, flank, of, the, russian, army, that, was, pushing, through, the, carpathian, passes, towards, hungary, employing, overwhelming, artillery, the, germans, and, austro, hungarians, broke, through, the, line, between, gorlice, and, tarn, w, and, kept, pushing, until, the, russians, were, driven, out, of, most, of, galicia, in, austro, hungarian, poland, during, this, advance, falkenhayn, rejected, schemes, to, try, to, cut, off, the, russians, in, poland, preferring, direct, frontal, attacks, like, bug, narew, offensive, outgunned, during, the, summer, of, 1915, the, russian, commander, grand, duke, nicholas, shortened, his, lines, by, withdrawing, from, most, of, poland, destroying, railroads, bridges, and, many, buildings, while, driving, 743, 000, poles, 350, 000, jews, 300, 000, lithuanians, and, 250, 000, latvians, into, russia, during, the, winter, of, 1915, 16, ludendorff, s, headquarters, was, in, kaunas, the, germans, occupied, present, day, lithuania, western, latvia, and, north, eastern, poland, an, area, almost, the, size, of, france, ludendorff, demanded, germanization, of, the, conquered, territories, and, far, ranging, annexations, offering, land, to, german, settlers, see, drang, nach, osten, far, reaching, plans, envisioned, courland, and, lithuania, turned, into, border, states, ruled, by, german, military, governors, answerable, only, to, the, kaiser, he, proposed, massive, annexations, and, colonization, in, eastern, europe, in, the, event, of, the, victory, of, the, german, reich, and, was, one, of, the, main, supporters, of, the, polish, border, strip, ludendorff, planned, to, combine, german, settlement, and, germanisation, in, conquered, areas, with, expulsions, of, native, populations, and, envisioned, an, eastern, german, empire, whose, resources, would, be, used, in, future, war, with, great, britain, and, the, united, states, ludendorff, s, plans, went, as, far, as, making, crimea, a, german, colony, as, to, the, various, nations, and, ethnic, groups, in, conquered, territories, ludendorff, believed, they, were, incapable, of, producing, real, culture, on, 16, march, 1916, the, russians, now, with, adequate, supplies, of, cannons, and, shells, attacked, parts, of, the, new, german, defenses, intending, to, penetrate, at, two, points, and, then, to, pocket, the, defenders, they, attacked, almost, daily, until, the, end, of, the, month, but, the, lake, naroch, offensive, failed, choked, in, swamp, and, blood, the, russians, did, better, attacking, the, austro, hungarians, in, the, south, the, brusilov, offensive, cracked, their, lines, with, a, well, prepared, surprise, wide, front, attack, led, by, well, schooled, assault, troops, the, breakthrough, was, finally, stemmed, by, austro, hungarian, troops, recalled, from, italy, stiffened, with, german, advisers, and, reserves, in, july, russian, attacks, on, the, germans, in, the, north, were, beaten, back, on, 27, july, 1916, hindenburg, was, given, command, of, all, troops, on, the, eastern, front, from, the, baltic, to, brody, in, the, ukraine, ludendorff, and, hindenburg, visited, their, new, command, on, a, special, train, and, then, set, up, headquarters, in, brest, litovsk, by, august, 1916, their, front, was, holding, everywhere, in, the, west, in, 1916, the, germans, attacked, unsuccessfully, at, verdun, and, soon, were, reeling, under, british, and, french, blows, along, the, somme, ludendorff, s, friends, at, the, ohl, led, by, max, bauer, lobbied, for, him, relentlessly, the, balance, was, tipped, when, romania, entered, the, war, on, the, side, of, the, entente, thrusting, into, hungary, falkenhayn, was, replaced, as, chief, of, the, general, staff, by, hindenburg, on, 29, august, 1916, ludendorff, was, again, his, chief, of, staff, as, first, quartermaster, general, with, the, stipulation, that, he, would, have, joint, responsibility, he, was, promoted, to, general, of, the, infantry, chancellor, bethmann, hollweg, warned, the, war, cabinet, you, don, t, know, ludendorff, who, is, only, great, at, a, time, of, success, if, things, go, badly, he, loses, his, nerve, their, first, concern, was, the, sizable, romanian, army, so, troops, sent, from, the, western, front, checked, romanian, and, russian, incursions, into, hungary, then, romania, was, invaded, from, the, south, by, german, austro, hungarian, bulgarian, and, ottoman, troops, commanded, by, august, von, mackensen, and, from, the, north, by, a, german, and, austro, hungarian, army, commanded, by, falkenhayn, bucharest, fell, in, december, 1916, according, to, mackensen, ludendorff, s, distant, management, consisted, of, floods, of, telegrams, as, superfluous, as, they, were, offensive, when, sure, that, the, romanians, would, be, defeated, the, ohl, moved, west, retaining, the, previous, staff, except, for, the, operations, officer, blamed, for, verdun, they, toured, the, western, front, meeting, and, evaluating, commanders, learning, about, their, problems, and, soliciting, their, opinions, at, each, meeting, ludendorff, did, most, of, talking, for, hindenburg, there, would, be, no, further, attacks, at, verdun, and, the, somme, would, be, defended, by, revised, tactics, that, exposed, fewer, men, to, british, shells, a, new, backup, defensive, line, would, be, built, like, the, one, they, had, constructed, in, the, east, the, allies, would, call, the, new, fortifications, the, hindenburg, line, the, german, goal, was, victory, which, they, defined, as, a, germany, with, extended, borders, that, could, be, more, easily, defended, in, the, next, war, hindenburg, was, given, titular, command, over, all, of, the, forces, of, the, central, powers, ludendorff, s, hand, was, everywhere, every, day, he, was, on, the, telephone, with, the, staffs, of, their, armies, and, the, army, was, deluged, with, ludendorff, s, paper, barrage, of, orders, instructions, and, demands, for, information, his, finger, extended, into, every, aspect, of, the, german, war, effort, he, issued, the, two, daily, communiques, and, often, met, with, the, newspaper, and, newsreel, reporters, before, long, the, public, idolized, him, as, the, german, army, s, brain, ludendorff, had, a, goal, one, thing, was, certain, the, power, must, be, in, my, hands, as, stipulated, by, the, constitution, of, the, german, empire, the, government, was, run, by, civil, servants, appointed, by, the, kaiser, confident, that, army, officers, were, superior, to, civilians, the, ohl, volunteered, to, oversee, the, economy, procurement, raw, materials, labor, and, food, max, bauer, with, his, industrialist, friends, began, by, setting, overambitious, targets, for, military, production, in, what, they, called, the, hindenburg, program, ludendorff, enthusiastically, participated, in, meetings, on, economic, policy, loudly, sometimes, pummeling, the, table, with, his, fists, implementation, of, the, program, was, assigned, to, general, groener, a, staff, officer, who, had, directed, the, field, railway, service, effectively, his, office, was, in, the, civilian, war, ministry, not, in, the, ohl, as, ludendorff, had, wanted, therefore, he, assigned, staff, officers, to, most, government, ministries, so, he, knew, what, was, going, on, and, could, press, his, demands, war, industry, s, major, problem, was, the, scarcity, of, skilled, workers, therefore, 125, 000, men, were, released, from, the, armed, forces, and, trained, workers, were, no, longer, conscripted, the, ohl, wanted, to, enroll, most, german, men, and, women, into, national, service, but, the, reichstag, legislated, that, only, males, 17, 60, were, subject, to, patriotic, service, and, refused, to, bind, war, workers, to, their, jobs, groener, realized, that, they, needed, the, support, of, the, workers, so, he, insisted, that, union, representatives, be, included, on, industrial, dispute, boards, he, also, advocated, an, excess, profits, tax, the, industrialists, were, incensed, on, 16, august, 1917, ludendorff, telegraphed, an, order, reassigning, groener, to, command, the, 33rd, infantry, division, overall, unable, to, control, labour, and, unwilling, to, control, industry, the, army, failed, miserably, to, the, public, it, seemed, that, ludendorff, was, running, the, nation, as, well, as, the, war, according, to, ludendorff, the, authorities, represented, me, as, a, dictator, he, would, not, become, chancellor, because, the, demands, for, running, the, war, were, too, great, the, historian, frank, tipton, argues, that, while, not, technically, a, dictator, ludendorff, was, unquestionably, the, most, powerful, man, in, germany, in, 1917, 18, the, ohl, did, nothing, to, mitigate, the, crisis, of, growing, food, shortages, in, germany, despite, the, allied, blockade, everyone, could, have, been, fed, adequately, but, supplies, were, not, managed, effectively, or, fairly, in, spring, 1918, half, of, all, the, meat, eggs, and, fruit, consumed, in, berlin, were, sold, on, the, black, market, the, navy, advocated, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, which, would, surely, bring, the, united, states, into, the, war, at, the, kaiser, s, request, his, commanders, met, with, his, friend, the, eminent, chemist, walther, nernst, who, knew, america, well, and, who, warned, against, the, idea, ludendorff, promptly, ended, the, meeting, it, was, incompetent, nonsense, with, which, a, civilian, was, wasting, his, time, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, began, in, february, 1917, with, the, ohl, s, strong, support, this, fatal, mistake, reflected, poor, military, judgment, in, uncritically, accepting, the, navy, s, contention, that, there, were, no, effective, potential, countermeasures, like, convoying, and, confidence, that, the, american, armed, forces, were, too, feeble, to, fight, effectively, by, the, end, of, the, war, germany, would, be, at, war, with, 27, nations, ludendorff, with, the, kaiser, s, blessing, helped, lenin, and, other, 30, or, so, revolutionaries, in, exile, return, to, russia, ludendorff, agreed, to, send, the, bolsheviks, in, switzerland, by, train, through, germany, from, where, they, would, then, travel, to, russia, via, sweden, lenin, however, still, took, some, convincing, insisting, that, he, be, sent, on, a, sealed, train, lenin, ultimately, agreed, on, 31, march, and, would, depart, switzerland, on, 8, april, in, the, spring, of, 1917, the, reichstag, passed, a, resolution, for, peace, without, annexations, or, indemnities, they, would, be, content, with, the, successful, defensive, war, undertaken, in, 1914, the, ohl, was, unable, to, defeat, the, resolution, or, to, have, it, substantially, watered, down, the, commanders, despised, chancellor, bethmann, hollweg, as, weak, so, they, forced, his, resignation, by, repeatedly, threatening, to, resign, themselves, despite, the, kaiser, s, admonition, that, this, was, not, their, business, bethmann, hollweg, was, replaced, by, a, minor, functionary, georg, michaelis, the, food, minister, who, announced, that, he, would, deal, with, the, resolution, as, in, his, own, fashion, despite, this, put, down, the, reichstag, voted, the, financial, credits, needed, for, continuing, the, war, following, the, overthrow, of, tsar, nicholas, ii, of, russia, the, new, russian, government, launched, the, kerensky, offensive, in, july, 1917, attacking, the, austro, hungarian, lines, in, galicia, after, minor, successes, the, russians, were, driven, back, and, many, of, their, soldiers, refused, to, fight, the, counterattack, was, halted, only, after, the, line, was, pushed, 240, kilometres, 150, mi, eastwards, the, germans, capped, the, year, in, the, east, by, capturing, the, strong, russian, fortress, of, riga, in, september, 1917, starting, with, a, brief, overwhelming, artillery, barrage, using, many, gas, shells, then, followed, by, infiltrating, infantry, the, bolsheviks, seized, power, and, soon, were, at, the, peace, table, ludendorff, insisted, on, the, huge, territorial, losses, forced, on, russia, in, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, even, though, this, required, that, a, million, german, soldiers, remain, in, the, east, during, the, peace, negotiations, with, russia, his, representative, kept, demanding, the, economic, concessions, coveted, by, german, industrialists, the, commanders, kept, blocking, attempts, to, frame, a, plausible, peace, offer, to, the, western, powers, by, insisting, on, borders, expanded, for, future, defense, ludendorff, regarded, the, germans, as, the, master, race, and, after, victory, planned, to, settle, ex, soldiers, in, the, baltic, states, and, in, alsace, lorraine, where, they, would, take, over, property, seized, from, balts, and, the, french, one, after, another, the, ohl, toppled, government, ministers, they, regarded, as, weak, in, contrast, to, the, ohl, s, questionable, interventions, in, politics, and, diplomacy, their, armies, continued, to, excel, the, commanders, would, agree, on, what, was, to, be, done, and, then, ludendorff, and, the, ohl, staff, produced, the, mass, of, orders, specifying, exactly, what, was, to, be, accomplished, on, the, western, front, they, stopped, packing, defenders, in, the, front, line, which, reduced, losses, to, enemy, artillery, they, issued, a, directive, on, elastic, defense, in, which, attackers, who, penetrated, a, lightly, held, front, line, entered, a, battle, zone, in, which, they, were, punished, by, artillery, and, counterattacks, it, remained, german, army, doctrine, through, world, war, ii, schools, taught, the, new, tactics, to, all, ranks, its, effectiveness, is, illustrated, by, comparing, the, first, half, of, 1916, in, which, 77, german, soldiers, died, or, went, missing, for, every, 100, british, to, the, second, half, when, 55, germans, were, lost, for, every, 100, british, by, february, 1917, the, ohl, was, sure, that, the, new, french, commander, general, robert, nivelle, would, attack, and, correctly, foresaw, that, he, would, try, to, pinch, off, the, german, salient, between, arras, and, noyon, so, the, ohl, withdrew, german, forces, to, the, segment, of, the, hindenburg, line, across, the, base, of, the, salient, in, operation, alberich, leaving, the, ground, they, gave, up, as, a, depopulated, waste, land, the, nivelle, offensive, in, april, 1917, was, blunted, by, mobile, defense, in, depth, many, french, units, mutinied, though, the, ohl, never, grasped, the, extent, of, the, disarray, the, british, supported, their, allies, with, a, successful, attack, near, arras, and, had, another, success, in, june, 1917, at, messines, ridge, in, flanders, then, at, the, end, of, july, 1917, the, british, attacked, passchendaele, ridge, at, first, the, defense, was, directed, by, general, von, lossberg, a, pioneer, in, defense, in, depth, but, when, the, british, adjusted, their, tactics, ludendorff, took, over, day, to, day, control, the, british, eventually, took, passchendaele, ridge, at, great, cost, ludendorff, worried, about, declining, morale, so, in, july, 1917, ohl, established, a, propaganda, unit, in, october, 1917, they, began, mandatory, patriotic, lectures, to, the, troops, who, were, assured, that, if, the, war, was, lost, they, would, become, slaves, of, international, capital, the, lecturers, were, to, ensure, that, a, fight, is, kept, up, against, all, agitators, croakers, and, weaklings, to, bolster, the, wobbling, austro, hungarian, government, the, germans, provided, some, troops, and, led, a, joint, attack, in, italy, in, october, they, sliced, through, the, italian, lines, in, the, mountains, at, caporetto, two, hundred, and, fifty, thousand, italians, were, captured, and, the, rest, of, italian, army, was, forced, to, retreat, to, the, grappa, piave, defensive, line, on, 20, november, 1917, the, british, achieved, a, total, surprise, by, attacking, at, cambrai, a, short, intense, bombardment, preceded, an, attack, by, tanks, which, led, the, infantry, through, the, german, wire, it, was, ludendorff, s, 52nd, birthday, but, he, was, too, upset, to, attend, the, celebratory, dinner, the, british, were, not, organized, to, exploit, their, breakthrough, and, german, reserves, counterattacked, in, some, places, driving, the, british, back, beyond, their, starting, lines, at, the, beginning, of, 1918, almost, a, million, munition, workers, struck, one, demand, was, peace, without, annexations, ohl, ordered, that, all, strikers, fit, to, bear, arms, be, sent, to, the, front, thereby, degrading, military, service, with, russia, out, of, the, war, the, germans, outnumbered, the, allies, on, the, western, front, after, extensive, consultations, ohl, planned, a, series, of, attacks, to, drive, the, british, out, of, the, war, during, the, winter, all, ranks, were, schooled, in, the, innovative, tactics, proven, at, caporetto, and, riga, the, first, attack, operation, michael, was, on, 21, march, 1918, near, cambrai, after, an, effective, hurricane, bombardment, coordinated, by, colonel, bruchm, ller, they, slashed, through, the, british, lines, surmounting, the, obstacles, that, had, thwarted, their, enemies, for, three, years, on, the, first, day, they, occupied, as, large, an, area, as, the, allies, had, won, on, the, somme, after, 140, days, the, allies, were, aghast, but, it, was, not, the, triumph, ohl, had, hoped, for, they, had, planned, another, tannenberg, by, surrounding, tens, of, thousands, of, british, troops, in, the, cambrai, salient, but, had, been, thwarted, by, stout, defense, and, fighting, withdrawal, they, lost, as, many, men, as, the, defenders, the, first, day, was, the, bloodiest, of, the, war, among, the, dead, was, ludendorff, s, oldest, stepson, a, younger, had, been, killed, earlier, the, germans, were, unable, to, cut, any, vital, railway, when, ludendorff, motored, near, the, front, he, was, displeased, by, seeing, how, the, numerous, slightly, wounded, made, things, difficult, by, the, stupid, and, displeasing, way, in, which, they, hurried, to, the, rear, the, americans, doubled, the, number, of, troops, being, sent, to, france, their, next, attack, was, in, flanders, again, they, broke, through, advancing, 30, km, 19, mi, and, forcing, the, british, to, give, back, all, of, the, ground, that, they, had, won, the, preceding, year, after, weeks, of, battle, but, the, germans, were, stopped, short, of, the, rail, junction, that, was, their, goal, next, to, draw, french, reserves, south, they, struck, along, the, chemin, des, dames, in, their, most, successful, attack, yet, they, advanced, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, on, the, first, day, crossing, the, marne, but, stopping, 56, kilometres, 35, mi, from, paris, however, each, german, triumph, weakened, their, army, and, its, morale, from, 20, march, 1918, to, 25, june, the, german, front, lengthened, from, 390, kilometres, 240, mi, to, 510, kilometres, 320, mi, then, the, germans, struck, near, reims, to, seize, additional, railway, lines, for, use, in, the, salient, but, were, foiled, by, brilliant, french, elastic, tactics, undeterred, on, 18, july, 1918, ludendorff, still, aggressive, and, confident, traveled, to, flanders, to, confer, about, the, next, attack, there, a, telephone, call, reported, that, the, french, and, americans, led, by, a, mass, of, tanks, had, smashed, through, the, right, flank, of, their, salient, pointing, toward, paris, on, the, opening, day, of, the, battle, of, soissons, everyone, present, realized, that, surely, they, had, lost, the, war, ludendorff, was, shattered, ohl, began, to, withdraw, step, by, step, to, new, defensive, lines, first, evacuating, all, of, their, wounded, and, supplies, ludendorff, s, communiques, which, hitherto, had, been, largely, factual, now, distorted, the, news, for, instance, claiming, that, american, troops, had, to, be, herded, onto, troop, ships, by, special, police, on, 8, august, 1918, the, germans, were, completely, surprised, at, amiens, when, british, tanks, broke, through, the, defenses, and, intact, german, formations, surrendered, to, ludendorff, it, was, the, black, day, in, the, history, of, the, german, army, the, german, retreats, continued, pressed, by, allied, attacks, ohl, still, vigorously, opposed, offering, to, give, up, the, territory, they, desired, in, france, and, belgium, so, the, german, government, was, unable, to, make, a, plausible, peace, proposal, ludendorff, became, increasingly, cantankerous, railing, at, his, staff, without, cause, publicly, accusing, hindenburg, of, talking, nonsense, and, sometimes, bursting, into, tears, bauer, wanted, him, replaced, but, instead, a, doctor, oberstabarzt, hochheimer, was, brought, to, ohl, he, had, worked, closely, with, ludendorff, in, poland, during, the, winter, of, 1915, 16, on, plans, to, bring, in, german, colonists, before, the, war, he, had, a, practice, in, nervous, diseases, hochheimer, spoke, as, a, friend, and, he, listened, as, a, friend, convincing, ludendorff, that, he, could, not, work, effectively, with, one, hour, of, sleep, a, night, and, that, he, must, relearn, how, to, relax, after, a, month, away, from, headquarters, ludendorff, had, recovered, from, the, severest, symptoms, of, battle, fatigue, on, 29, september, 1918, ludendorff, and, hindenburg, suddenly, told, an, incredulous, kaiser, that, they, could, not, guarantee, the, integrity, of, the, western, front, for, two, hours, and, they, must, have, an, immediate, armistice, a, new, chancellor, prince, maximilian, of, baden, approached, president, woodrow, wilson, but, wilson, s, terms, were, unacceptable, to, the, german, leadership, and, so, the, german, army, fought, on, the, chancellor, told, the, kaiser, that, he, and, his, cabinet, would, resign, unless, ludendorff, was, removed, but, that, hindenburg, must, remain, to, hold, the, army, together, the, kaiser, called, his, commanders, in, curtly, accepting, ludendorff, s, resignation, and, then, rejecting, hindenburg, s, fuming, ludendorff, would, not, accompany, the, field, marshal, back, to, headquarters, i, refused, to, ride, with, you, because, you, have, treated, me, so, shabbily, ludendorff, had, assiduously, sought, all, of, the, credit, now, he, was, rewarded, with, all, of, the, blame, widely, despised, and, with, revolution, breaking, out, he, was, hidden, by, his, brother, and, a, network, of, friends, until, he, slipped, out, of, germany, disguised, in, blue, spectacles, and, a, false, beard, and, fake, finnish, passport, settling, in, a, swedish, admirer, s, country, home, until, the, swedish, government, asked, him, to, leave, in, february, 1919, within, seven, months, he, wrote, two, volumes, of, detailed, memoirs, friends, led, by, breucker, provided, him, with, documents, and, negotiated, with, publishers, groener, who, is, not, mentioned, in, the, book, characterized, it, as, a, showcase, of, his, caesar, mania, he, was, a, brilliant, general, according, to, john, wheeler, bennett, stating, that, he, was, certainly, one, of, the, greatest, routine, military, organizers, that, the, world, has, ever, seen, but, he, also, said, he, was, a, ruinous, political, meddler, the, influential, military, analyst, hans, delbr, ck, concluded, that, the, empire, was, built, by, moltke, and, bismarck, destroyed, by, tirpitz, and, ludendorff, in, exile, ludendorff, wrote, numerous, books, and, articles, about, the, german, military, s, conduct, of, the, war, while, forming, the, foundation, for, the, dolchstosslegende, the, stab, in, the, back, theory, for, which, he, is, considered, largely, responsible, insisting, that, a, domestic, crisis, had, sparked, germany, s, surrender, while, the, military, situation, held, firm, ignoring, that, he, himself, had, pressed, the, politicians, for, an, armistice, on, military, grounds, ludendorff, was, convinced, that, germany, had, fought, a, defensive, war, and, in, his, opinion, that, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, had, failed, to, organize, a, proper, counter, propaganda, campaign, or, provide, efficient, leadership, ludendorff, was, extremely, suspicious, of, the, social, democrats, and, leftists, whom, he, blamed, for, the, humiliation, of, germany, through, the, versailles, treaty, ludendorff, claimed, that, he, paid, close, attention, to, the, business, element, especially, the, jews, and, saw, them, turn, their, backs, on, the, war, effort, by, as, he, saw, it, letting, profit, rather, than, patriotism, dictate, production, and, financing, again, focusing, on, the, left, ludendorff, was, appalled, by, the, strikes, that, took, place, towards, the, end, of, the, war, and, the, way, that, the, home, front, collapsed, before, the, military, front, did, with, the, former, poisoning, the, morale, of, soldiers, on, temporary, leave, most, importantly, ludendorff, felt, that, the, german, people, as, a, whole, had, underestimated, what, was, at, stake, in, the, war, he, was, convinced, that, the, entente, had, started, the, war, and, was, determined, to, dismantle, germany, completely, ludendorff, wrote, by, the, revolution, the, germans, have, made, themselves, pariahs, among, the, nations, incapable, of, winning, allies, helots, in, the, service, of, foreigners, and, foreign, capital, and, deprived, of, all, self, respect, in, twenty, years, time, the, german, people, will, curse, the, parties, who, now, boast, of, having, made, the, revolution, ludendorff, returned, to, berlin, in, february, 1919, staying, at, the, adlon, hotel, he, talked, with, another, resident, sir, neill, malcolm, the, head, of, the, british, military, mission, after, ludendorff, presented, his, excuses, for, the, german, defeat, malcolm, said, you, mean, that, you, were, stabbed, in, the, back, coining, a, key, catchphrase, for, the, german, right, wing, on, 12, march, 1920, 5, 000, freikorps, troops, under, the, command, of, walther, von, l, ttwitz, marched, on, the, chancellery, forcing, the, government, led, by, friedrich, ebert, and, gustav, bauer, to, flee, the, city, the, putschists, proclaimed, a, new, government, with, a, right, wing, politician, wolfgang, kapp, as, the, new, chancellor, ludendorff, and, max, bauer, were, part, of, the, putsch, the, kapp, putsch, was, soon, defeated, by, a, general, strike, that, brought, berlin, to, a, standstill, the, leaders, fled, ludendorff, to, bavaria, where, a, right, wing, coup, had, succeeded, he, published, two, volumes, of, annotated, and, in, a, few, instances, pruned, documents, and, commentaries, documenting, his, war, service, he, reconciled, with, hindenburg, who, began, to, visit, every, year, in, may, 1923, ludendorff, had, an, agreeable, first, meeting, with, adolf, hitler, and, soon, he, had, regular, contacts, with, nazis, on, 8, november, 1923, the, bavarian, staatskommissar, gustav, von, kahr, was, addressing, a, jammed, meeting, in, a, large, beer, hall, the, b, rgerbr, ukeller, hitler, waving, a, pistol, jumped, onto, the, stage, announcing, that, the, national, revolution, was, underway, the, hall, was, occupied, by, armed, men, who, covered, the, audience, with, a, machine, gun, the, first, move, in, the, beer, hall, putsch, hitler, announced, that, he, would, lead, the, reich, government, and, ludendorff, would, command, the, army, he, addressed, the, now, enthusiastically, supportive, audience, and, then, spent, the, night, in, the, war, ministry, unsuccessfully, trying, to, obtain, the, army, s, backing, the, next, morning, 3, 000, armed, nazis, formed, outside, of, the, b, rgerbr, ukeller, and, marched, into, central, munich, the, leaders, just, behind, the, flag, bearers, they, were, blocked, by, a, cordon, of, police, and, firing, broke, out, for, less, than, a, minute, several, of, the, nazis, in, front, were, hit, or, dropped, to, the, ground, ludendorff, and, his, adjutant, major, streck, marched, to, the, police, line, where, they, pushed, aside, the, rifle, barrels, he, was, respectfully, arrested, he, was, indignant, when, he, was, sent, home, while, the, other, leaders, remained, in, custody, four, police, officers, and, 15, nazis, had, been, killed, including, ludendorff, s, servant, kurt, neubauer, they, were, tried, in, early, 1924, ludendorff, was, acquitted, but, heinz, pernet, ludendorff, s, stepson, was, convicted, of, aiding, and, abetting, treason, given, a, fifteen, month, sentence, hitler, went, to, prison, but, was, released, after, nine, months, ludendorff, s, 60th, birthday, was, celebrated, by, massed, bands, and, a, large, torchlight, parade, in, 1924, he, was, elected, to, the, reichstag, as, a, representative, of, the, nsfb, a, coalition, of, the, german, v, lkisch, freedom, party, dvfp, and, members, of, the, nazi, party, serving, until, 1928, in, 1925, he, founded, the, tannenbergbund, a, german, nationalist, organization, which, was, both, anti, semitic, and, anti, catholic, and, published, literature, espousing, conspiracy, theories, involving, jews, catholics, especially, jesuits, and, freemasons, as, his, views, became, more, extreme, under, the, influence, of, his, wife, mathilde, von, kemnitz, ludendorff, gradually, began, to, part, company, with, hitler, who, was, surreptitiously, working, to, undermine, the, reputation, of, his, one, serious, rival, for, the, leadership, of, the, extreme, right, in, germany, nonetheless, ludendorff, was, persuaded, to, run, for, president, of, the, republic, in, the, march, 1925, election, as, the, dvfp, candidate, in, alliance, with, the, nazis, but, received, only, 1, 1, per, cent, of, the, vote, there, is, some, evidence, that, hitler, himself, persuaded, ludendorff, to, run, knowing, that, the, results, would, be, humiliating, no, one, had, a, majority, in, the, initial, round, of, the, election, so, a, second, round, was, needed, hindenburg, entered, the, race, and, was, narrowly, elected, ludendorff, was, so, humiliated, by, what, he, saw, as, a, betrayal, by, his, old, friend, that, he, broke, off, relations, with, hindenburg, and, in, 1927, refused, to, even, stand, beside, the, field, marshal, at, the, dedication, of, the, tannenberg, memorial, he, attacked, hindenburg, abusively, for, not, having, acted, in, a, nationalistic, soldier, like, fashion, the, berlin, based, liberal, newspaper, vossische, zeitung, states, in, its, article, ludendorff, s, hate, tirades, against, hindenburg, poisonous, gas, from, hitler, s, camp, that, ludendorff, was, as, of, 29, march, 1930, deeply, grounded, in, nazi, ideology, tipton, notes, that, ludendorff, was, a, social, darwinist, who, believed, that, war, was, the, foundation, of, human, society, and, that, military, dictatorship, was, the, normal, form, of, government, in, a, society, in, which, every, resource, must, be, mobilized, the, historian, margaret, l, anderson, notes, that, after, the, war, ludendorff, wanted, germany, to, go, to, war, against, all, of, europe, and, that, he, became, a, pagan, worshipper, of, the, nordic, god, wotan, odin, he, detested, not, only, judaism, but, also, christianity, which, he, regarded, as, a, weakening, force, in, 1926, ludendorff, divorced, margarethe, schmidt, and, married, his, second, wife, mathilde, von, kemnitz, 1877, 1966, they, published, books, and, essays, claiming, that, the, world, s, problems, were, the, result, of, christianity, especially, the, jesuits, and, catholics, but, also, conspiracies, by, jews, and, the, freemasons, they, founded, the, bund, f, r, gotteserkenntnis, in, german, society, for, the, knowledge, of, god, a, small, and, rather, obscure, esoterical, society, of, theists, that, survives, to, this, day, by, the, time, hitler, came, to, power, ludendorff, was, no, longer, sympathetic, to, him, the, nazis, distanced, themselves, from, ludendorff, because, of, his, eccentric, conspiracy, theories, on, 30, january, 1933, the, occasion, of, hitler, s, appointment, as, chancellor, by, president, hindenburg, ludendorff, allegedly, sent, the, following, telegram, to, hindenburg, i, solemnly, prophesy, that, this, accursed, man, will, cast, our, reich, into, the, abyss, and, bring, our, nation, to, inconceivable, misery, future, generations, will, damn, you, in, your, grave, for, what, you, have, done, some, historians, consider, this, text, to, be, a, forgery, in, an, attempt, to, regain, ludendorff, s, favor, hitler, arrived, unannounced, at, ludendorff, s, home, on, his, 70th, birthday, in, 1935, to, promote, him, to, field, marshal, infuriated, ludendorff, allegedly, rebuffed, hitler, by, telling, him, an, officer, is, named, general, field, marshal, on, the, battlefield, not, at, a, birthday, tea, party, in, the, midst, of, peace, he, wrote, two, further, books, on, military, themes, ludendorff, died, of, liver, cancer, in, the, private, clinic, josephinum, in, munich, on, 20, december, 1937, at, the, age, of, 72, he, was, given, against, his, explicit, wishes, a, state, funeral, organized, and, attended, by, hitler, who, declined, to, speak, at, his, eulogy, he, was, buried, in, the, neuer, friedhof, in, tutzing, in, bavaria, he, received, the, following, honours, final, solution
