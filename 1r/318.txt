qualifications, only, aldington, and, h, d, could, lay, claim, to, the, title, in, his, view, during, the, subsequent, row, pound, left, the, table, and, returned, with, a, tin, bathtub, on, his, head, suggesting, it, as, a, symbol, of, what, he, called, les, nagistes, a, school, created, by, lowell, s, poem, in, a, garden, which, ends, with, night, and, the, water, and, you, in, your, whiteness, bathing, apparently, his, behavior, helped, lowell, win, people, over, to, her, point, of, view, as, did, her, offer, to, fund, future, work, h, d, and, aldington, were, moving, away, from, pound, s, understanding, of, imagisme, anyway, as, he, aligned, himself, with, lewis, s, ideas, lowell, agreed, to, finance, an, annual, anthology, of, imagiste, poets, but, she, insisted, on, democracy, according, to, aldington, she, proposed, a, boston, tea, party, for, ezra, and, an, end, to, his, despotic, rule, upset, at, lowell, pound, began, to, call, imagisme, amygism, he, declared,

fenollosa, had, given, pound, her, husband, s, notes, in, 1913, after, laurence, binyon, introduced, them, michael, alexander, saw, cathay, as, the, most, attractive, of, pound, s, work, there, is, a, debate, about, whether, the, poems, should, be, viewed, primarily, as, translations, or, as, contributions, to, imagism, and, the, modernization, of, english, poetry, english, professor, steven, yao, argued, that, cathay, shows, that, translation, does, not, need, a, thorough, knowledge, of, the, source, language, pound, s, translations, from, old, english, latin, italian, french, and, chinese, were, highly, disputed, according, to, alexander, they, made, him, more, unpopular, in, some, circles, than, the, treason, charge, robert, graves, wrote, in, 1955, knew, little, latin, yet, he, translated, propertius, and, less, greek, but, he, translated, alcaeus, and, still, less, anglo, saxon, yet, he, translated, the, seafarer, i, once, asked, arthur, waley, how, much, chinese, pound,

he, died, gaudier, brzeska, had, written, to, pound, to, say, that, he, kept, cathay, in, his, pocket, to, put, courage, in, my, fellows, after, the, publication, of, cathay, pound, mentioned, that, he, was, working, on, a, long, poem, he, described, it, in, september, 1915, as, a, cryselephantine, poem, of, immeasurable, length, which, will, occupy, me, for, the, next, four, decades, unless, it, becomes, a, bore, in, february, 1916, when, pound, was, 30, the, poet, carl, sandburg, paid, tribute, to, him, in, poetry, magazine, pound, stains, darkly, and, touches, softly, he, wrote, all, talk, on, modern, poetry, by, people, who, know, ends, with, dragging, in, ezra, pound, somewhere, he, may, be, named, only, to, be, cursed, as, wanton, and, mocker, poseur, trifler, and, vagrant, or, he, may, be, classed, as, filling, a, niche, today, like, that, of, keats, in, a, preceding, epoch, the, point, is, he, will, be, mentioned, in, the, cool, and, purple, meantime, pound, goes, ahead, producing, new, poems, having, the, slogan, guts, and, efficiency, emblazoned, above, his, daily, program, of, work, his, genius, runs, to, various, schools, and, styles, he, acquires, traits, and, then, throws, them, away, one, characteristic, is, that, he, has, no, characteristics, he, is, a, new, roamer, of, the, beautiful, a, new, fetcher, of, wild, shapes, in, each, new, handful, of, writings, offered, us, in, june, july, and, august, 1917, pound, had, the, first, three, cantos, published, as, three, cantos, in, poetry, he, was, now, a, regular, contributor, to, three, literary, magazines, from, 1917, he, wrote, music, reviews, for, the, new, age, as, william, atheling, and, art, reviews, as, b, h, dias, in, may, 1917, margaret, anderson, hired, him, as, foreign, editor, of, the, little, review, he, also, wrote, weekly, pieces, for, the, egoist, and, the, little, review, many, of, the, latter, complained, about, provincialism, which, included, the, ringing, of, church, bells, when, pound, lived, near, st, mary, abbots, he, had, engaged, in, a, fierce, guerrilla, warfare, of, letters, about, the, bells, with, the, vicar, reverend, r, e, pennefather, according, to, richard, aldington, the, volume, of, writing, exhausted, him, in, 1918, after, a, bout, of, illness, which, was, presumably, the, spanish, flu, he, decided, to, stop, writing, for, the, little, review, he, had, asked, the, publisher, for, a, raise, to, hire, a, typist, the, 23, year, old, iseult, gonne, causing, rumors, that, they, were, having, an, affair, but, he, was, turned, down, and, the, days, are, not, full, enough, and, the, nights, are, not, full, enough, and, life, slips, by, like, a, field, mouse, not, shaking, the, grass, personae, 1926, a, suspicion, arose, in, june, 1918, that, pound, himself, had, written, an, article, in, the, egoist, praising, his, own, work, and, it, was, clear, from, the, response, that, he, had, acquired, enemies, the, poet, f, s, flint, told, the, egoist, s, editor, that, we, are, all, tired, of, mr, pound, british, literary, circles, were, tired, of, his, antics, and, of, him, puffing, and, swelling, himself, and, his, friends, flint, wrote, his, work, has, deteriorated, from, book, to, book, his, manners, have, become, more, and, more, offensive, and, we, wish, he, would, go, back, to, america, the, march, 1919, issue, of, poetry,

in, april, 1919, from, a, professor, of, latin, w, g, hale, who, found, about, three, score, errors, in, the, text, he, said, pound, was, incredibly, ignorant, of, latin, that, much, of, what, he, makes, his, author, say, is, unintelligible, and, that, if, mr, pound, were, a, professor, of, latin, there, would, be, nothing, left, for, him, but, suicide, adding, i, do, not, counsel, this, pound, replied, to, monroe, cat, piss, and, porcupines, the, thing, is, no, more, a, translation, than, my, altaforte, is, a, translation, or, than, fitzgerald, s, omar, is, a, translation, his, letter, ended, in, final, commiseration, monroe, interpreted, his, silence, after, that, as, his, resignation, from, poetry, magazine, he, strove, to, resuscitate, the, dead, art, of, poetry, to, maintain, the, sublime, in, the, old, sense, wrong, from, the, start, no, hardly, but, seeing, he, had, been, born, in, a, half, savage, country, out, of, date, bent, resolutely, on, wringing, lilies, from, the, acorn, capaneus, trout, for, factitious, bait, caught, in, the, unstopped, ear, giving, the, rocks, small, lee, way, the, chopped, seas, held, him, therefore, that, year, hugh, selwyn, mauberley, 1920, by, 1919, pound, felt, there, was, no, reason, to, stay, in, england, he, had, become, violently, hostile, to, england, according, to, aldington, feeling, he, was, being, frozen, out, of, everything, except, the, new, age, and, concluding, that, the, british, were, insensitive, to, mental, agility, in, any, and, every, form, he, had, muffed, his, chances, of, becoming, literary,

before, turning, to, social, criticism, economics, and, the, war, here, the, word, usury, first, appears, in, his, work, just, as, eliot, denied, he, was, prufrock, pound, denied, he, was, mauberley,

emphatic, a, gesture, of, disgust, but, at, least, without, gratitude, to, this, country, has, been, an, exhilarating, influence, for, culture, in, england, he, has, left, his, mark, upon, more, than, one, of, the, arts, upon, literature, music, poetry, and, sculpture, and, quite, a, number, of, men, and, movements, owe, their, initiation, to, his, self, sacrificing, stimulus, with, all, this, however, mr, pound, like, so, many, others, who, have, striven, for, advancement, of, intelligence, and, culture, in, england, has, made, more, enemies, than, friends, and, far, more, powerful, enemies, than, friends, much, of, the, press, has, been, deliberately, closed, by, cabal, to, him, his, books, have, for, some, time, been, ignored, or, written, down, and, he, himself, has, been,

to, pound, s, notes, that, he, probably, had, narcissistic, personality, disorder, the, main, feature, of, pound, s, personality, he, wrote, was, his, profound, incredible, over, weaning, sic, narcissism, a, personality, disorder, unlike, conditions, that, give, rise, to, psychosis, is, not, regarded, as, a, mental, illness, and, the, diagnosis, would, have, made, pound, fit, to, stand,

stock, first, wrote, to, pound, in, hospital, after, reading, the, pisan, cantos, in, the, new, times, in, april, 1956, pound, wrote, our, victorian, forebears, would, have, been, greatly, scandalized, at, the, idea, that, one, might, not, be, free, to, study, inherited, racial, characteristics, and, some, races, are, retentive, mainly, of, the, least, desirable, bits, of, their, barbaric, past, there, was, a, jewish, communist, plot, which, he, compared, to, syphilis, equality, was, dismissed, as, anti, biological, nonsense, there, were, no, gas, ovens, in, italy, he, wrote, in, april, 1956, a, month, later, he, referred, to, the, fuss, about, hitler, on, 10, august, 1956, it, is, perfectly, well, known, that, the, fuss, about, de, segregation, in, the, united, states, has, been, started, by, jews, instead, america, needed, race, pride, using, pseudonyms, he, sent, his, articles, directly, to, stock, so, that, the, newspaper, s, editor, may, not, have, realized, they, had, all, been, written, by, pound, stock, sent, pound, copies, of, the, published, articles, which, he, would, distribute, to, his, followers, he, contributed, similar, material, to, other, publications, including, edge, which, stock, founded, in, october, 1956, stock, called, edge, the, magazine, of, the, international, poundian, underground, pound, s, friends, continued, to, try, to,

be, treason, she, visited, him, twice, in, 1952, and, 1955, but, could, not, convince, him, to, be, more, assertive, about, his, release, in, 1950, she, had, written, to, hemingway, to, complain, that, pound, s, friends, had, not, done, enough, hemingway, and, rudge, did, not, like, each, other, he, told, dorothy, in, 1951, that, the, person, who, makes, least, sense, in, all, this, is, olga, rudge, in, what, john, cohassey, called, a, controlled, teeth, gritting, response, hemingway, replied, to, rudge, that, he, would, pardon, pound, if, he, could, but, that, pound, had, made, the, rather, serious, mistake, of, being, a, traitor, to, his, country, and, temporarily, he, must, lie, in, the, bed, he, made, he, ended, by, saying, to, be, even, more, blunt, i, have, always, loved, dorothy, and, still, do, four, years, later, shortly, after, he, won, the, nobel, prize, in, literature, in, 1954, hemingway, told, time, magazine, i, believe, this, would, be, a, good, year, to,

and, friendships, but, he, signed, macleish, s, letter, anyway, and, pledged, 1, 500, to, be, handed, to, pound, upon, his, release, in, an, interview, for, the, paris, review, in, early, 1958,

brunnenburg, near, merano, in, south, tyrol, to, live, with, his, daughter, maria, where, pound, met, his, grandchildren, for, the, first, time, dorothy, had, usually, ignored, his, affairs, but, she, used, her, legal, power, over, his, royalties, to, make, sure, spann, was, seen, off, sent, back, to, the, united, states, in, october, 1959, by, december, 1959, pound, was, mired, in, depression, according, to, the, writer, michael, reck, who, visited, him, several, times, at, st, elizabeths, pound, was, a, changed, man, he, said, little, and, called, his, work, worthless, in, a, 1960, interview, in, rome, with, donald, hall, for, paris, review, he, said, you, find, me, in, fragments, he, paced, up, and, down, during, the, three, days, it, took, to, complete, the, interview, never, finishing, a, sentence, bursting, with, energy, one, minute, then, sagging, and, at, one, point, seemed, about, to, collapse, hall, said, it, was, clear, that, he, doubted, the, value, of, everything, he, had, done, in, his, life, those, close, to, him, thought, he, had, dementia, and, in, mid, 1960, he, spent, time, in, a, clinic, when, his, weight, dropped, he, picked, up, again, but, by, early, 1961, he, had, a, urinary, tract, infection, dorothy, felt, unable, to, look, after, him, so, he, went, to, live, with, olga, rudge, first, in, rapallo, then, in, venice, dorothy, mostly, stayed, in, london, after, that, with, omar, in, 1961, pound, attended, a, meeting, in, rome, in, honor, of, oswald, mosley, who, was, visiting, italy, his, health, continued, to, decline, and, his, friends, were, dying, wyndham, lewis, in, 1957, ernest, hemingway, in, 1961, hemingway, shot, himself, e, e, cummings, in, 1962, william, carlos, williams, in, 1963, and, t, s, eliot, in, 1965, in, 1963, he, told, an, interviewer, grazia, livi, i, spoil, everything, i, touch, all, my, life, i, believed, i, knew, nothing, yes, knew, nothing, and, so, words, became, devoid, of, meaning, he, attended, eliot, s, funeral, in, london, and, visited, w, b, yeats, widow, in, dublin, yeats, died, in, 1939, in, 1966, he, was, admitted, to, the, genoa, school, of, medicine, s, psychiatric, hospital, for, an, evaluation, after, prostate, surgery, his, notes, said, he, had, psychomotor, retardation, insomnia, depression, and, he, believed, he, had, been, contaminated, by, microbes, according, to, a, psychiatrist, who, treated, him, pound, had, previously, been, treated, with, electroconvulsive, therapy, this, time, he, was, given, imipramine, and, responded, well, the, doctors, diagnosed, bipolar, disorder, two, years, later, he, attended, the, opening, of, an, exhibition, in, new, york, featuring, his, blue, inked, version, of, eliot, s, the, waste, land, he, went, on, to, hamilton, college, and, received, a, standing, ovation, pound, s, biographer, michael, reck, claimed, to, have, had, an, encounter, with, pound, at, the, restaurant, of, the, pensione, cici, in, venice, in, 1967, during, which, pound, told, allen, ginsberg, and, peter, russell, that, his, own, poems, were, a, lot, of, double, talk, and, made, no, sense, and, that, his, writing, was, a, mess, stupid, and, ignorant, all, the, way, through, reck, wrote, about, the, meeting, in, evergreen, review, the, following, year, at, seventy, i, realized, that, instead, of, being, a, lunatic, i, was, a, moron, pound, reportedly, said, he, looked, very, morose, and, barely, spoke, there, is, nothing, harder, than, conversing, with, pound, nowadays, reck, wrote, pound, had, offered, a, carefully, worded, rejection, of, his, antisemitism, according, to, reck, when, ginsberg, reassured, pound, that, he, had, shown, us, the, way, he, is, said, to, have, replied, any, good, i, ve, done, has, been, spoiled, by, bad, intentions, the, preoccupation, with, irrelevant, and, stupid, things, reck, continued, then, very, slowly, with, emphasis, surely, conscious, of, ginsberg, s, being, jewish, but, the, worst, mistake, i, made, was, that, stupid, suburban, prejudice, of, anti, semitism, matthias, koehl, an, american, neo, nazi, who, claimed, to, have, met, with, pound, during, the, latter, s, incarceration, at, st, elizabeths, hospital, cast, doubt, on, these, claims, writing, in, 1990, that, the, ezra, pound, i, knew, was, cheerfully, unrepentant, firm, in, his, beliefs, and, staunchly, true, to, those, principles, he, had, upheld, throughout, his, life, never, once, did, he, give, so, much, as, the, slightest, hint, that, he, had, any, regret, about, anything, he, had, ever, done, or, spoken, during, the, 30s, and, 40s, not, excluding, his, celebrated, views, on, the, jewish, question, in, fact, his, pointed, references, to, any, number, of, nefarious, jewish, practices, left, no, doubt, as, to, where, he, stood, on, that, particular, issue, unable, to, deny, the, manifest, greatness, of, a, literary, giant, but, concerned, lest, pound, s, other, ideas, gain, acceptance, employs, one, of, the, oldest, tricks, in, the, book, he, tries, to, have, the, master, himself, recant, but, the, master, il, miglior, fabbro, has, spoken, otherwise, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1972, an, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, committee, which, included, his, publisher, james, laughlin, proposed, that, pound, be, awarded, the, emerson, thoreau, medal, after, a, storm,
