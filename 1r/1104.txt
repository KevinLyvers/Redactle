killed, her, own, children, this, was, later, proven, false, these, rumors, seem, to, have, surfaced, 400, years, after, her, death, likely, due, to, the, belief, in, ancient, china, that, a, woman,

furthermore, wang, had, no, children, and, xiao, had, one, son, li, sujie, and, two, daughters, princesses, yiyang, and, xuancheng, wang, seeing, that, gaozong, was, still, impressed, by, wu, s, beauty, hoped, that, the, arrival, of, a, new, concubine, would, divert, the, emperor, from, xiao, therefore, she, secretly, told, wu, to, stop, shaving, her, hair, and, later, welcomed, her, to, the, palace, some, modern, historians, dispute, this, traditional, account, some, think, that, wu, never, left, the, imperial, palace, and, might, have, had, an, affair, with, gaozong, while, taizong, was, still, alive, wu, soon, overtook, xiao, as, gaozong, s, favorite, in, 652, she, gave, birth, to, her, first, child, a, son, named, li, hong, in, 653, she, gave, birth, to, another, son, li, xi, n, neither, of, these, sons, was, in, contention, to, be, gaozong, s, heir, because, gaozong, at, the, request, of, officials, influenced, by, wang, and, her, uncle, the, chancellor, liu, shi, had, designated, his, eldest, son, li, zhong, as, his, heir, li, zhong, s, mother, consort, liu, was, of, lowly, birth, wang, did, this, in, order, to, receive, liu, s, gratitude, by, 654, both, wang, and, xiao, had, lost, favor, with, gaozong, and, these, two, former, romantic, rivals, joined, forces, against, wu, but, to, no, avail, for, example, as, a, sign, of, his, love, for, wu, gaozong, conferred, posthumous, honors, on, her, father, wu, shiyue, in, 654, in, the, same, year, wu, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, but, her, daughter, died, shortly, after, birth, with, evidence, suggesting, deliberate, strangulation, the, evidence, include, allegations, made, by, wu, herself, and, she, accused, wang, of, murder, wang, was, accused, of, having, been, seen, near, the, child, s, room, with, corroborating, testimony, by, alleged, eyewitnesses, gaozong, was, led, to, believe, that, wang, motivated, by, jealousy, had, most, likely, killed, the, child, wang, lacked, an, alibi, and, was, unable, to, clear, her, name, scientifically, credible, forensic, pathology, information, about, the, death, of, wu, s, daughter, does, not, exist, and, scholars, lack, concrete, evidence, about, her, death, but, scholars, have, many, theories, and, speculations, because, traditional, folklore, tends, to, portray, wu, as, a, power, hungry, woman, unconcerned, about, whom, she, hurt, or, what, she, did, the, most, popular, theory, is, that, wu, killed, her, own, child, in, order, to, implicate, wang, other, schools, of, thought, argue, that, wang, indeed, killed, the, child, out, of, jealousy, and, hatred, of, wu, the, third, argument, is, that, the, child, died, of, asphyxiation, or, crib, death, the, ventilation, systems, of, the, time, were, nonexistent, or, of, poor, quality, and, the, lack, of, ventilation, combined, with, using, coal, as, a, heating, method, could, have, led, to, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, in, any, case, wu, blamed, wang, for, the, girl, s, death, and, as, a, result, tried, to, remove, wang, from, her, position, because, of, the, child, s, death, an, angry, gaozong, also, wanted, to, depose, wang, and, replace, her, with, wu, but, first, he, needed, to, make, sure, that, he, had, the, support, of, the, government, chancellors, so, gaozong, met, with, his, uncle, zhangsun, wuji, the, head, chancellor, during, the, meeting, gaozong, repeatedly, brought, up, wang, s, childlessness, childlessness, was, a, sufficient, excuse, to, depose, wang, but, zhangsun, repeatedly, found, ways, to, divert, the, conversation, subsequent, visits, made, by, wu, s, mother, lady, yang, and, an, official, allied, with, wu, xu, jingzong, to, seek, support, from, zhangsun, were, met, with, disappointment, early, in, 655, he, wanted, to, create, wu, who, carried, the, sixth, highest, rank, among, imperial, consorts, zhaoyi, meaning, the, lady, of, the, bright, section, the, extraordinary, and, unprecedented, title, of, chenfei, meaning, the, cosmic, consort, and, promote, her, over, all, other, imperial, consorts, directly, under, wang, herself, but, han, and, fellow, chancellor, lai, ji, both, opposed, on, the, grounds, that, the, title, was, unprecedented, and, so, gaozong, did, not, carry, it, out, of, course, the, evidence, shows, that, he, probably, granted, this, title, but, it, is, still, unclear, in, summer, 655, wu, accused, wang, and, her, mother, lady, liu, of, using, witchcraft, in, response, gaozong, barred, liu, from, the, palace, and, demoted, wang, s, uncle, liu, shi, meanwhile, a, faction, of, officials, began, to, form, around, wu, including, li, yifu, xu, cui, yixuan, and, yuan, gongyu, once, in, the, autumn, of, 655, gaozong, summoned, the, chancellors, zhangsun, li, ji, yu, zhining, and, chu, suiliang, to, the, palace, chu, had, deduced, that, the, summons, was, about, changing, the, empress, li, ji, claimed, illness, and, refused, to, attend, at, the, meeting, chu, vehemently, opposed, deposing, wang, while, zhangsun, and, yu, showed, their, disapproval, by, silence, meanwhile, chancellors, han, yuan, and, lai, ji, also, opposed, the, move, when, gaozong, asked, li, ji, again, he, responded, this, is, your, family, matter, your, imperial, majesty, why, ask, anyone, else, gaozong, therefore, became, resolved, he, demoted, chu, to, commandant, at, tan, prefecture, roughly, modern, changsha, hunan, and, then, deposed, both, wang, and, xiao, he, placed, them, both, under, arrest, and, made, wu, empress, later, that, year, gaozong, showed, signs, of, considering, their, release, because, of, this, wang, and, xiao, were, killed, on, empress, wu, s, orders, after, their, deaths, they, often, haunted, wu, s, dreams, for, the, rest, of, gaozong, s, reign, wu, and, gaozong, often, took,

powerful, force, in, the, world, of, politics, and, had, great, influence, over, the, emperor, after, empress, wu, s, ascension, one, of, the, first, things, she, did, was, to, submit, a, petition, ostensibly, praising, the, faithfulness, of, han, and, lai, in, opposing, the, unprecedented, chenfei, title, the, real, purpose, was, to, show, that, she, remembered, that, they, had, offended, her, and, it, made, han, and, lai, apprehensive, that, she, was, aware, of, their, opposition, of, her, han, offered, to, resign, soon, thereafter, an, offer, that, emperor, gaozong, did, not, accept, in, 656, on, the, advice, of, xu, jingzong, emperor, gaozong, deposed, consort, liu, s, son, li, zhong, from, being, his, heir, apparent, he, changed, li, zhong, s, status, to, prince, of, liang, and, designated, empress, wu, s, son, li, hong, as, the, title, of, prince, of, dai, and, crown, prince, that, is, heir, apparent, soon, after, empress, wu, became, dominant, at, court, installing, officials, who, favored, her, ascension, in, chancellor, posts, in, 657, empress, wu, persuaded, emperor, gaozong, to, split, the, empire, into, two, capitals, and, make, luoyang, the, capital,

context, designating, a, new, dynasty, with, her, as, emperor, can, be, seen, as, part, of, her, power, politics, and, as, the, culmination, of, her, rule, though, wu, s, zhou, dynasty, had, its, own, notable, characteristics, they, are, difficult, to, separate, from, wu, s, reign, of, power, which, lasted, for, about, half, of, a, century, wu, s, consolidation, of, power, in, part, relied, on, a, system, of, spies, she, used, informants, to, choose, people, to, eliminate, a, process, that, peaked, in, 697, with, the, wholesale, demotion, exile, or, killing, of, various, aristocratic, families, and, scholars, furthermore, prohibiting, their, sons, from, holding, office, wu, eliminated, many, of, her, real, potential, or, perceived, rivals, to, power, by, means, of, death, including, execution, suicide, by, command, and, more, or, less, directly, killing, people, demotion, and, exile, mostly, this, was, carried, out, by, her, secret, police, led, by, people, like, wao, ganjun, and, lai, junchen, who, were, known, to, have, written, the, manual, of, accusation, a, document, detailing, steps, for, interrogation, and, obtaining, confessions, by, torture, one, of, these, methods, the, dying, swine, s, melancholy, which, merely, indicated, a, level, of, pain, inflicted, by, a, torture, device, seems, to, have, been, conflated, in, the, years, following, wu, s, death, with, the, story, of, the, human, swine, torture, conducted, by, empress, l, zhi, in, which, her, victim, had, her, eyes, gouged, out, hands, and, feet, chopped, off, ears, burnt, and, was, imprisoned, in, a, latrine, wu, targeted, various, people, including, many, in, her, own, family, in, reaction, to, an, attempt, to, remove, her, from, power, in, 684, she, massacred, 12, entire, collateral, branches, of, the, imperial, family, besides, this, she, also, altered, the, ancient, balance, of, power, in, china, dating, to, the, qin, dynasty, the, old, area, of, the, qin, state, was, later, called, guanzhong, literally, the, area, within, the, fortified, mountain, passes, from, this, area, of, northwest, china, the, ying, family, of, qin, arose, unifying, china, into, its, first, historical, empire, during, the, han, dynasty, sima, qian, records, in, his, shiji, that, guanzhong, had, three, tenths, of, china, s, population, but, six, tenths, of, its, wealth, additionally, at, the, beginning, of, wu, s, ascendency, guanzhong, was, still, the, stronghold, of, the, most, nationally, powerful, aristocratic, families, even, though, economic, development, in, other, parts, of, china, had, improved, the, lot, of, families, in, other, regions, the, guangzhong, aristocracy, was, not, willing, to, relinquish, its, hold, on, the, reins, of, government, but, some, of, the, more, newly, wealthy, families, in, other, areas, such, as, the, north, china, plain, or, hubei, were, eager, for, a, larger, share, of, national, power, most, of, the, opposition, to, wu, was, from, the, guangzhong, families, of, northwest, china, accordingly, she, repressed, them, instead, favoring, less, privileged, families, thus, raising, to, the, ranks, of, power, many, talented, but, less, aristocratic, families, often, recruited, through, the, official, examination, system, many, of, those, so, favored, originated, from, the, north, china, plain, through, a, process, of, eliminating, or, diminishing, the, power, of, the, established, aristocracy, whom, she, perceived, as, disloyal, to, her, and, establishing, a, reformed, upper, class, in, china, loyal, to, her, wu, made, major, social, changes, that, historians, are, still, evaluating, many, of, wu, s, measures, were, popular, and, helped, her, to, gain, support, for, her, rule, wu, came, to, power, during, a, time, in, china, in, which, the, people, were, fairly, contented, the, administration, was, run, well, and, the, economy, was, characterized, by, rising, living, standards, for, the, most, part, as, far, as, the, masses, were, concerned, wu, continued, in, this, manner, she, was, determined, that, free, self, sufficient, farmers, continue, to, work, their, own, land, so, she, periodically, used, the, juntian, equal, field, system, together, with, updated, census, figures, to, ensure, fair, land, allocations, reallocating, as, necessary, much, of, her, success, was, due, to, her, various, edicts, including, those, known, as, her, acts, of, grace, which, helped, satisfy, the, needs, of, the, lower, classes, through, various, acts, of, relief, her, widening, recruitment, to, government, service, to, include, previously, excluded, gentry, and, commoners, and, her, generous, promotions, and, pay, raises, for, the, lower, ranks, wu, used, her, military, and, diplomatic, skills, to, enhance, her, position, the, fubing, system, of, self, supportive, soldier, farmer, colonies, which, provided, local, militia, and, labor, services, for, her, government, allowed, her, to, maintain, her, armed, forces, at, reduced, expense, she, also, pursued, a, policy, of, military, action, to, expand, the, empire, to, its, furthest, extent, ever, up, to, that,

rule, and, by, allying, with, goguryeo, and, baekche, was, able, to, expel, its, former, ally, from, the, peninsula, hong, argues, that, silla, s, success, was, in, part, due, to, a, shift, in, wu, s, focus, to, tibet, and, inadequate, support, for, the, forces, in, the, korean, peninsula, in, 694, wu, s, forces, decisively, defeated, the, tibetan, western, turk, alliance, and, retook, the, four, garrisons, of, anxi, in, 651, shortly, after, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, the, first, arab, ambassador, arrived, in, china, one, apparatus, of, government, that, fell, into, wu, s, power, was, the, imperial, examination, system, the, basic, theory, and, practice, of, which, was, to, recruit, into, government, service, those, men, who, were, the, best, educated, most, talented, and, had, the, best, potential, to, perform, their, duties, and, to, do, so, by, testing, a, pool, of, candidates, to, determine, this, this, pool, was, male, only, and, the, qualified, pool, of, candidates, and, resulting, placements, into, official, positions, was, on, a, relatively, small, scale, at, the, time, wu, took, control, of, government, the, official, tests, examined, things, considered, important, for, functionaries, of, the, highly, developed, bureaucratic, government, structure, of, the, imperial, government, such, as, level, of, literacy, in, terms, of, reading, and, writing, and, possession, of, the, specific, knowledge, considered, necessary, and, desirable, for, a, governmental, official, such, as, confucian, precepts, on, the, nature, of, virtue, and, theory, on, the, proper, ordering, of, and, relationships, within, society, wu, continued, to, use, the, imperial, examination, system, to, recruit, civil, servants, and, introduced, major, changes, to, the, system, she, inherited, including, increasing, the, pool, of, candidates, permitted, to, take, the, test, by, allowing, commoners, and, gentry, previously, disqualified, by, their, background, to, take, it, in, 693, she, expanded, the, governmental, examination, system, and, greatly, increased, the, importance, of, this, method, of, recruiting, government, officials, wu, provided, increased, opportunity, for, the, representation, within, government, to, people, of, the, north, china, plain, versus, people, of, the, northwestern, aristocratic, families, whom, she, decimated, anyway, and, the, successful, candidates, recruited, through, the, examination, system, became, an, elite, group, within, her, government, the, historical, details, of, the, consequences, of, wu, s, promoting, a, new, group, of, people, from, previously, disenfranchised, backgrounds, into, prominence, as, powerful, governmental, officials, and, the, examination, system, s, role, remain, debated, by, scholars, of, this, subject, wu, zetian, used, her, political, powers, to, harness, from, buddhist, practices, a, strategy, to, build, sovereignty, and, legitimacy, to, her, throne, while, decisively, establishing, the, zhou, dynasty, in, a, society, under, confucian, and, patriarchal, ideals, one, of, the, first, steps, she, took, to, legitimize, her, ascension, to, the, throne, was, to, proclaim, herself, as, the, reincarnation, of, the, devi, of, pure, radiance, jingguang, tiann, through, a, series, of, prophecies, in, 690, wu, sought, out, the, support, of, the, monk, xue, huaiyi, her, reputed, lover, and, other, nine, orthodox, buddhist, monks, to, compose, the, apocryphal, commentary, on, the, meanings, of, the, prophecies, about, the, divine, sovereign, in, the, great, cloud, sutra, dayunjing,

reincarnated, in, a, woman, s, body, in, order, to, convert, beings, and, rule, over, the, territory, of, a, country, wu, s, buddhist, supporters, meticulously, propagated, the, commentary, on, the, eve, of, her, accession, to, the, dragon, throne, while, seeking, to, justify, the, various, events, that, led, wu, to, occupy, the, position, of, huangdi, as, a, female, ruler, and, bodhisattva, since, gender, in, the, buddhist, devi, worlds, have, no, standard, form, wu, later, took, a, further, step, to, transcend, her, gender, limitations, by, identifying, herself, as, the, incarnation, of, two, important, male, buddhist, divinities, maitreya, and, vairocana, her, narrative, was, intentionally, crafted, to, persuade, the, confucian, establishment, circumvent, the, five, impediments, that, restricted, women, from, holding, political, and, religious, power, and, gain, public, support, according, to, william, dalrymple, wu, used, buddhist, texts, brought, from, nalanda, university, by, xuanzang, to, justify, her, rule, and, her, reign, resulted, in, a, substantial, importation, of, indian, ideas, wu, also, implemented, several, indian, principles, such, as, those, of, the, ashokan, edicts, into, the, governance, of, her, empire, and, had, many, indians, become, part, of, the, royal, court, including, faith, healers, and, astrologers, in, relation, to, daoism, there,

empress, as, a, great, unifier, of, the, nation, appeared, in, the, press, even, though, she, was, popularly, reviled, as, a, ruthless, wicked, ruler, who, had, mercilessly, crushed, her, opponents, however, dikotter, did, not, cite, sources, for, his, claim, in, his, biography, wu, jonathan, clements, writes, that, these, wildly, differing, uses, of, a, historical, figure, often, led, to, contradictory, and, even, hysterical, characterizations, many, alleged, poisonings, and, other, incidents, such, as, her, daughter, s, premature, death, may, have, rational, explanations, that, have, been, twisted, by, later, opponents, the, traditional, chinese, historical, view, of, wu, zetian, generally, was, mixed, admiring, her, for, her, abilities, in, governing, the, state, but, vilifying,

his, sons, soon, thereafter, great, accusations, arose, and, many, innocent, people, were, falsely, accused, and, stuck, their, necks, out, in, waiting, for, execution, heaven, and, earth, became, like, a, huge, cage, and, even, if, one, could, escape, it, where, could, he, go, that, was, lamentable, in, the, past, the, trick, of, covering, the, nose, surprised, the, realm, in, its,
