gaspard, monge, comte, de, p, luse, 9, may, 1746, 28, july, 1818, was, a, french, mathematician, commonly, presented, as, the, inventor, of, descriptive, geometry, the, mathematical, basis, of, technical, drawing, and, the, father, of, differential, geometry, during, the, french, revolution, he, served, as, the, minister, of, the, marine, and, was, involved, in, the, reform, of, the, french, educational, system, helping, to, found, the, cole, polytechnique, monge, was, born, at, beaune, c, te, d, or, the, son, of, a, merchant, he, was, educated, at, the, college, of, the, oratorians, at, beaune, in, 1762, he, went, to, the, coll, ge, de, la, trinit, at, lyon, where, one, year, after, he, had, begun, studying, he, was, made, a, teacher, of, physics, at, the, age, of, just, seventeen, after, finishing, his, education, in, 1764, he, returned, to, beaune, where, he, made, a, large, scale, plan, of, the, town, inventing, the, methods, of, observation, and, constructing, the, necessary, instruments, the, plan, was, presented, to, the, town, and, is, still, preserved, in, their, library, an, officer, of, engineers, who, saw, it, wrote, to, the, commandant, of, the, cole, royale, du, g, nie, at, m, zi, res, recommending, monge, to, him, and, he, was, given, a, job, as, a, draftsman, l, t, c, rolt, an, engineer, and, historian, of, technology, credited, monge, with, the, birth, of, engineering, drawing, when, in, the, royal, school, he, became, a, member, of, freemasonry, initiated, into, l, union, parfaite, lodge, those, studying, at, the, officer, school, were, exclusively, drawn, from, the, aristocracy, so, he, was, not, allowed, admission, to, the, institution, itself, his, manual, skill, was, highly, regarded, but, his, mathematical, skills, were, not, made, use, of, nevertheless, he, worked, on, the, development, of, his, ideas, in, his, spare, time, at, this, time, he, came, to, contact, with, charles, bossut, the, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, cole, royale, du, g, nie, i, was, a, thousand, times, tempted, he, said, long, afterwards, to, tear, up, my, drawings, in, disgust, at, the, esteem, in, which, they, were, held, as, if, i, had, been, good, for, nothing, better, after, a, year, at, the, cole, royale, monge, was, asked, to, produce, a, plan, for, a, fortification, in, such, a, way, as, to, optimise, its, defensive, arrangement, there, was, an, established, method, for, doing, this, which, involved, lengthy, calculations, but, monge, devised, a, way, of, solving, the, problems, by, using, drawings, at, first, his, solution, was, not, accepted, since, it, had, not, taken, the, time, judged, to, be, necessary, but, upon, examination, the, value, of, the, work, was, recognised, and, monge, s, exceptional, abilities, were, recognised, after, bossut, left, the, cole, royale, du, g, nie, monge, took, his, place, in, january, 1769, and, in, 1770, he, was, also, appointed, instructor, in, experimental,

sciences, his, friendship, with, chemist, c, l, berthollet, began, at, this, time, in, 1783, after, leaving, m, zi, res, he, was, on, the, death, of, b, zout, appointed, examiner, of, naval, candidates, although, pressed, by, the, minister, to, prepare, a, complete, course, of, mathematics, he, declined, to, do, so, on, the, grounds, that, this, would, deprive, mme, b, zout, of, her, only, income, that, from, the, sale, of, the, textbooks, written, by, her, late, husband, in, 1786, he, wrote, and, published, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, la, statique, the, french, revolution, completely, changed, the, course, of, monge, s, career, he, was, a, strong, supporter, of, the, revolution, and, in, 1792, on, the, creation, by, the, legislative, assembly, of, an, executive, council, monge, accepted, the, office, of, minister, of, the, marine, and, held, this, office, from, 10, august, 1792, to, 10, april, 1793, when, he, resigned, when, the, committee, of, public, safety, made, an, appeal, to, the, academics, to, assist, in, the, defence, of, the, republic, he, applied, himself, wholly, to, these, operations, and, distinguished, himself, by, his, energy, writing, the, description, le, l, art, de, fabriquer, les, canons, and, avis, aux, ouvriers, en, fer, sur, la, fabrication, de, l, acier, he, took, a, very, active, part, in, the, measures, for, the, establishment, of, the, ecole, normale, which, existed, only, during, the, first, four, months, of, the, year, 1795, and, of, the, school, for, public, works, afterwards, the, cole, polytechnique, and, was, at, each, of, them, professor, for, descriptive, geometry, g, om, trie, descriptive, le, ons, donn, es, aux, coles, normales, was, published, in, 1799, from, transcriptions, of, his, lectures, given, in, 1795, he, later, published, application, de, l, analyse, la, g, om, trie, which, enlarged, on, the, lectures, from, may, 1796, to, october, 1797, monge, was, in, italy, with, c,

resumed, his, connection, with, the, cole, polytechnique, his, later, mathematical, papers, are, published, 1794, 1816, in, the, journal, and, the, correspondence, of, the, cole, polytechnique, on, the, formation, of, the, s, nat, conservateur, he, was, appointed, a, member, of, that, body, with, an, ample, provision, and, the, title, of, count, of, pelusium, comte, de, p, luse, and, he, became, the, senate, conservateur, s, president, during, 1806, 7, then, on, the, fall, of, napoleon, he, had, all, of, his, honours, taken, away, and, he, was, even, excluded, from, the, list, of, members,

later, transferred, to, the, panth, on, in, paris, a, statue, portraying, him, was, erected, in, beaune, in, 1849, monge, s, name, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, base, of, the, eiffel, tower, since, 4, november, 1992, the, marine, nationale, operate, the, mris, monge, named, after, him, between, 1770, and, 1790, monge, contributed, various, papers, on, mathematics, and, physics, to, the, memoirs, of, the, academy, of, turin, the, m, moires, des, savantes, trangers, of, the, academy, of, paris, the, m, moires, of, the, same, academy, and, the, annales, de, chimie, including, sur, la, th, orie, des, d, blais, et, des, remblais, m, m, de, l, acad, de, paris, 1781, which, is, an, elegant, investigation, of, the, problem, with, earthworks, referred, to, in, the, title, and, establishes, in, connection, with, it, his, capital, discovery, of, the, curves, of, curvature, of, a, surface, it, is, also, noteworthy, to, mention, that, in, his, m, moire, sur, quelques, ph, nom, nes, de, la, vision, monge, proposed, an, early, implicit, explanation, of, the, color, constancy, phenomenon, based, on, several, known, observations, leonhard, euler, in, his, 1760, paper, on, curvature, in, the, berlin, memoirs, had, considered, not, the, normals, of, the, surface, but, the, normals, of, the, plane, sections, through, a, particular, normal, so, that, the, question, of, the, intersection, of, successive, normals, of, the, surface, had, never, presented, itself, to, him, monge, s, paper, gives, the, ordinary, differential, equation, of, the, curves, of, curvature, and, establishes, the, general, theory, in, a, very, satisfactory, manner, the, application, to, the, interesting, particular, case, of, the, ellipsoid, was, first, made, by, him, in, a, later, paper, in, 1795, monge, s, 1781, memoir, is, also, the, earliest, known, anticipation, of, linear, optimization, problems, in, particular, of, the, transportation, problem, related, to, that, the, monge, soil, transport, problem, leads, to, a, weak, topology, definition, of, a, distance, between, distributions, rediscovered, many, times, since, by, such, as, l, v, kantorovich, paul, l, vy, leonid, vaser, te, n, and, others, and, bearing, their, names, in, various, combinations, in, various, contexts, another, of, his, papers, in, the, volume, for, 1783, relates, to, the, production, of, water, by, the, combustion, of, hydrogen, monge, s, results, had, been, anticipated, by, henry, cavendish, it, was, also, in, this, time, from, 1783, 1784, that, monge, worked, with, jean, fran, ois, jean, baptiste, paul, antoine, or, abb, pierre, romain, clouet, to, liquefy, sulfur, dioxide, by, passing, a, stream, of, the, gas, through, a, u, tube, sunken, in, a, refrigerant, mixture, of, ice, and, salt, this, made, them, the, first, to, liquefy, a, pure, gas
