basil, ii, porphyrogenitus, greek, basileios, porphyrogennetos, 958, 15, december, 1025, nicknamed, the, bulgar, slayer, greek, ho, boulgarokt, nos, was, the, senior, byzantine, emperor, from, 976, to, 1025, he, and, his, brother, constantine, viii, were, crowned, before, their, father, romanos, ii, died, in, 963, but, they, were, too, young, to, rule, the, throne, thus, went, to, two, generals, nikephoros, phokas, r, 963, 969, and, john, tzimiskes, r, 969, 976, before, basil, became, senior, emperor, though, his, influential, great, uncle, basil, lekapenos, remained, as, the, de, facto, ruler, until, 985, his, reign, of, 49, years, and, 11, months, was, the, longest, of, any, roman, emperor, the, early, years, of, basil, s, reign, were, dominated, by, civil, wars, against, two, powerful, generals, from, the, byzantine, anatolian, aristocracy, first, bardas, skleros, and, later, bardas, phokas, which, ended, shortly, after, phokas, death, and, skleros, submission, in, 989, basil, then, oversaw, the, stabilization, and, expansion, of, the, eastern, frontier, of, the, byzantine, empire, and, the, complete, subjugation, of, the, first, bulgarian, empire, its, foremost, european, foe, after, a, long, struggle, although, the, byzantines, had, made, a, truce, with, the, fatimid, caliphate, in, 987, 988, basil, led, a, campaign, against, the, caliphate, that, ended, with, another, truce, in, 1000, he, also, conducted, a, campaign, against, the, khazar, khaganate, that, gained, the, byzantine, empire, part, of, crimea, and, a, series, of, successful, campaigns, against, the, kingdom, of, georgia, despite, near, constant, warfare, basil, distinguished, himself, as, an, administrator, reducing, the, power, of, the, great, land, owning, families, who, dominated, the, empire, s, administration, and, military, filling, its, treasury, and, leaving, it, with, its, greatest, expanse, in, four, centuries, although, his, successors, were, largely, incapable, rulers, the, empire, flourished, for, decades, after, basil, s, death, one, of, the, most, important, decisions, taken, during, his, reign, was, to, offer, the, hand, of, his, sister, anna, porphyrogenita, to, vladimir, i, of, kiev, in, exchange, for, military, support, thus, forming, the, byzantine, military, unit, known, as, the, varangian, guard, the, marriage, of, anna, and, vladimir, led, to, the, christianization, of, the, kievan, rus, and, the, incorporation, of, later, successor, states, of, kievan, rus, within, the, byzantine, cultural, and, religious, tradition, basil, is, seen, as, a, greek, national, hero, but, is, a, despised, figure, among, bulgarians, the, courtier, and, historian, michael, psellos, who, was, born, towards, the, end, of, basil, s, reign, gives, a, description, of, basil, in, his, chronographia, psellos, describes, him, as, a, stocky, man, of, shorter, than, average, stature, who, nevertheless, was, an, impressive, figure, on, horseback, he, had, light, blue, eyes, strongly, arched, eyebrows, luxuriant, side, whiskers, which, he, had, a, habit, of, rolling, between, his, fingers, when, deep, in, thought, or, angry, and, in, later, life, a, scant, beard, psellos, also, states, that, basil, was, not, an, articulate, speaker, and, had, a, loud, laugh, that, convulsed, his, whole, frame, basil, is, described, as, having, ascetic, tastes, and, caring, little, for, the, pomp, and, ceremony, of, the, imperial, court, typically, wearing, a, sombre, dark, purple, robe, furnished, with, few, of, the, gems, that, usually, decorated, imperial, costumes, he, is, also, described, as, a, capable, administrator, who, left, a, well, stocked, treasury, upon, his, death, basil, supposedly, despised, literary, culture, and, affected, scorn, for, the, learned, classes, of, byzantium, according, to, the, 19th, century, historian, george, finlay, basil, saw, himself, as, prudent, just, and, devout, others, considered, him, severe, rapacious, cruel, and, bigoted, for, greek, learning, he, cared, little, and, he, was, a, type, of, the, higher, byzantine, moral, character, which, retained, far, more, of, its, roman, than, its, greek, origin, the, modern, historian, john, julius, norwich, wrote, of, basil, no, lonelier, man, ever, occupied, the, byzantine, throne, and, it, is, hardly, surprising, basil, was, ugly, dirty, coarse, boorish, philistine, and, almost, pathologically, mean, he, was, in, short, deeply, un, byzantine, he, cared, only, for, the, greatness, of, his, empire, no, wonder, that, in, his, hands, it, reached, its, apogee, basil, ii, was, born, in, 958, he, was, a, porphyrogennetos, born, into, the, purple, as, were, his, father, romanos, ii, and, his, grandfather, constantine, vii, this, was, the, appellation, used, for, children, who, were, born, to, a, reigning, emperor, basil, was, the, eldest, son, of, romanos, and, his, laconian, greek, second, wife, theophano, who, was, the, daughter, of, a, poor, tavern, keeper, named, krateros, and, may, have, originated, from, the, city, of, sparta, he, may, have, had, an, elder, sister, named, helena, born, c, 955, romanos, succeeded, constantine, vii, as, sole, emperor, upon, the, latter, s, death, in, 959, basil, s, father, crowned, him, as, co, emperor, on, 22, april, 960, and, his, brother, constantine, born, 960, or, 961, eventually, to, rule, as, sole, emperor, constantine, viii, in, 1025, 1028, in, 962, or, 963, only, two, days, after, the, birth, of, his, youngest, child, anna, romanos, ii, died, on, 15, march, 963, at, 24, years, of, age, his, unexpected, death, was, commonly, thought, at, the, time, to, be, the, result, of, poisoning, with, hemlock, the, chroniclers, leo, the, deacon, and, john, skylitzes, imply, that, theophano, was, responsible, and, according, to, skylitzes, she, had, been, complicit, in, an, earlier, attempt, by, romanos, ii, to, poison, constantine, vii, basil, and, constantine, were, too, young, to, rule, in, their, own, right, when, romanos, died, in, 963, therefore, although, the, byzantine, senate, confirmed, them, as, emperors, with, their, mother, as, the, nominal, regent, de, facto, power, passed, for, the, time, into, the, hands, of, the, parakoimomenos, joseph, bringas, theophano, did, not, trust, bringas, however, and, another, enemy, of, the, powerful, parakoimomenos, was, basil, lekapenos, an, illegitimate, eunuch, son, of, emperor, romanos, i, basil, s, great, grandfather, lekapenos, himself, had, been, parakoimomenos, to, constantine, vii, and, megas, baioulos, to, romanos, ii, yet, another, enemy, of, bringas, was, the, successful, and, widely, popular, general, nikephoros, phokas, who, had, just, returned, from, his, conquest, of, the, emirate, of, crete, and, a, highly, successful, raid, into, cilicia, and, syria, which, culminated, in, the, sack, of, aleppo, phokas, was, proclaimed, emperor, by, his, men, in, july, and, marched, on, constantinople, bringas, tried, to, bring, in, troops, to, stop, his, rival, s, advance, but, the, capital, s, populace, supported, nikephoros, bringas, fled, leaving, his, post, to, lekapenos, and, on, 16, august, 963, nikephoros, phokas, was, crowned, emperor, on, 20, september, phokas, married, theophano, but, problems, resulted, it, was, a, second, marriage, for, each, spouse, and, nikephoros, was, thought, to, be, the, godfather, of, basil, or, his, brother, perhaps, both, although, polyeuctus, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, disapproved, of, the, marriage, the, church, declared, it, to, be, valid, with, it, nikephoros, secured, his, legitimacy, and, became, the, guardian, of, romanos, sons, he, was, murdered, in, december, 969, by, theophano, and, his, nephew, john, tzimiskes, who, then, became, emperor, john, i, and, exiled, theophano, john, married, theodora, a, sister, of, romanos, ii, basil, ii, acceded, to, the, throne, as, effective, ruler, and, senior, emperor, when, john, died, on, 10, january, 976, he, immediately, had, his, mother, brought, back, from, her, convent, basil, was, a, very, successful, soldier, on, horseback, and, through, his, achievement, he, proved, himself, to, be, an, able, general, and, a, strong, ruler, in, the, early, years, of, his, reign, administration, remained, in, the, hands, of, basil, lekapenos, as, president, of, the, byzantine, senate, lekapenos, was, a, wily, gifted, politician, who, hoped, the, young, emperors, would, be, his, puppets, the, younger, basil, waited, and, watched, without, interfering, devoting, himself, to, learning, the, details, of, administrative, business, and, military, science, nikephoros, ii, and, john, i, were, brilliant, military, commanders, but, proved, to, be, poor, administrators, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, john, had, belatedly, planned, to, curb, the, power, of, the, great, landowners, his, death, which, occurred, soon, after, he, spoke, out, against, them, led, to, rumors, that, he, had, been, poisoned, by, lekapenos, who, had, illegally, acquired, vast, estates, and, feared, an, investigation, and, punishment, at, the, start, of, his, reign, the, failures, of, his, immediate, predecessors, left, basil, ii, with, a, serious, problem, bardas, skleros, and, bardas, phokas, members, of, the, wealthy, military, elite, of, anatolia, had, sufficient, means, to, undertake, open, rebellion, against, his, authority, skleros, and, phokas, both, of, whom, were, experienced, generals, wanted, to, assume, the, imperial, position, that, nikephoros, ii, and, john, i, had, held, and, thus, return, basil, to, the, role, of, impotent, cypher, basil, showing, a, penchant, for, ruthlessness, took, to, the, field, himself, and, suppressed, the, rebellions, of, both, skleros, 979, and, phokas, 989, with, the, help, of, 12, 000, georgians, of, tornikios, and, david, iii, kuropalates, of, tao, the, fall, of, lekapenos, occurred, between, the, rebellions, in, 985, he, was, accused, of, plotting, with, the, rebels, and, was, punished, with, exile, and, the, confiscation, of, his, property, the, relationship, between, the, two, generals, was, complicated, phokas, was, instrumental, in, defeating, the, rebellion, of, skleros, but, when, phokas, later, rebelled, skleros, returned, from, exile, to, support, him, when, phokas, died, in, battle, skleros, whom, phokas, had, imprisoned, assumed, the, leadership, of, the, rebellion, basil, s, brother, constantine, who, had, no, interest, in, politics, statecraft, or, the, military, led, troops, alongside, basil, this, was, the, only, military, command, constantine, would, hold, the, campaign, ended, without, combat, when, skleros, was, forced, to, surrender, to, basil, in, 989, skleros, was, allowed, to, live, but, he, died, blind, either, through, disease, or, from, being, blinded, as, punishment, for, his, insurrection, these, rebellions, had, a, profound, effect, on, basil, s, outlook, and, methods, of, governance, psellos, describes, the, defeated, skleros, giving, basil, the, following, advice, which, he, took, to, heart, cut, down, the, governors, who, become, over, proud, let, no, generals, on, campaign, have, too, many, resources, exhaust, them, with, unjust, exactions, to, keep, them, busied, with, their, own, affairs, admit, no, woman, to, the, imperial, councils, be, accessible, to, no, one, share, with, few, your, most, intimate, plans, to, defeat, these, dangerous, revolts, basil, formed, an, alliance, with, prince, vladimir, i, of, kiev, who, in, 988, had, captured, chersonesos, the, empire, s, main, base, in, the, crimean, peninsula, vladimir, offered, to, evacuate, chersonesos, and, to, supply, 6, 000, of, his, soldiers, as, reinforcements, to, basil, in, exchange, he, demanded, to, be, married, to, basil, s, younger, sister, anna, at, first, basil, hesitated, the, byzantines, viewed, all, of, the, peoples, of, northern, europe, namely, franks, and, slavs, as, barbarians, anna, objected, to, marrying, a, barbarian, ruler, because, such, a, marriage, would, have, no, precedent, in, imperial, annals, vladimir, had, researched, various, religions, having, sent, delegates, to, various, countries, marriage, was, not, his, main, reason, for, choosing, christianity, when, vladimir, promised, to, baptize, himself, and, to, convert, his, people, to, christianity, basil, finally, agreed, vladimir, and, anna, were, married, in, crimea, in, 989, the, rus, warriors, taken, into, basil, s, army, were, instrumental, in, ending, the, rebellion, they, were, later, organized, into, the, varangian, guard, this, marriage, had, important, long, term, implications, marking, the, beginning, of, the, process, by, which, the, grand, duchy, of, moscow, many, centuries, later, would, proclaim, itself, the, third, rome, and, claim, the, political, and, cultural, heritage, of, the, byzantine, empire, once, the, internal, strife, was, quelled, basil, turned, his, attention, to, the, empire, s, other, enemies, the, byzantine, civil, wars, had, weakened, the, empire, s, position, in, the, east, and, the, gains, of, nikephoros, ii, and, john, i, had, nearly, been, lost, to, the, fatimid, caliphate, in, 987, 988, a, seven, year, truce, with, the, fatimids, was, signed, it, stipulated, an, exchange, of, prisoners, the, recognition, of, the, byzantine, emperor, as, protector, of, christians, under, fatimid, rule, and, of, the, fatimid, caliph, as, protector, of, muslims, under, byzantine, control, and, the, replacement, of, the, name, of, the, abbasid, caliph, with, that, of, the, fatimid, caliph, in, the, friday, prayer, in, the, mosque, at, constantinople, this, lasted, until, the, long, time, vizier, yaqub, ibn, killis, died, in, 991, fatimid, caliph, al, aziz, billah, chose, to, pursue, a, more, aggressive, stance, in, syria, and, appointed, manjutakin, as, governor, of, damascus, encouraged, by, the, defectors, after, the, death, of, emir, sa, d, al, dawla, al, aziz, decided, to, renew, his, attacks, on, the, hamdanid, emirate, of, aleppo, a, byzantine, protectorate, perhaps, expecting, basil, would, not, interfere, manjutakin, invaded, the, emirate, defeated, a, byzantine, force, under, the, doux, of, antioch, michael, bourtzes, in, june, 992, and, laid, siege, to, aleppo, the, city, easily, resisted, in, early, 993, after, thirteen, months, of, campaigning, a, lack, of, supplies, forced, manjutakin, to, return, to, damascus, in, 994, manjutakin, resumed, his, offensive, and, in, september, scored, a, major, victory, at, the, battle, of, the, orontes, against, bourtzes, bourtzes, defeat, forced, basil, to, intervene, personally, in, the, east, with, his, army, he, rode, through, asia, minor, to, aleppo, in, sixteen, days, arriving, in, april, 995, basil, s, sudden, arrival, and, the, exaggeration, of, his, army, s, strength, circulating, in, the, fatimid, camp, caused, panic, in, the, fatimid, army, especially, because, manjutakin, expecting, no, threat, had, ordered, his, cavalry, horses, to, be, dispersed, around, the, city, for, pasture, despite, having, a, considerably, larger, and, well, rested, army, manjutakin, was, at, a, disadvantage, he, burned, his, camp, and, retreated, to, damascus, without, battle, the, byzantines, besieged, tripoli, unsuccessfully, and, occupied, tartus, which, they, refortified, and, garrisoned, with, armenian, troops, al, aziz, now, prepared, to, take, to, the, field, in, person, against, the, byzantines, and, initiated, large, scale, preparations, but, they, were, abandoned, upon, his, death, warfare, between, the, two, powers, continued, as, the, byzantines, supported, an, anti, fatimid, uprising, in, tyre, in, 998, the, byzantines, under, damian, dalassenos, the, successor, of, bourtzes, launched, an, attack, on, apamea, but, the, fatimid, general, jaysh, ibn, al, samsama, defeated, them, in, battle, on, 19, july, 998, this, defeat, drew, basil, back, into, the, conflict, he, arrived, in, syria, in, october, 999, and, remained, there, for, three, months, basil, s, troops, raided, as, far, as, heliopolis, placed, a, garrison, at, larissa, and, burnt, three, minor, forts, in, the, vicinity, of, abu, qubais, masyath, and, arca, the, siege, of, tripoli, in, december, failed, while, emesa, was, not, threatened, basil, s, attention, was, diverted, to, developments, in, georgia, following, the, murder, of, david, iii, kuropalates, he, departed, for, cilicia, in, january, and, dispatched, another, embassy, to, cairo, in, 1000, a, ten, year, truce, was, concluded, between, the, two, states, for, the, remainder, of, the, reign, of, al, hakim, bi, amr, allah, r, 996, 1021, relations, remained, peaceful, as, al, hakim, was, more, interested, in, internal, affairs, even, the, acknowledgement, of, fatimid, suzerainty, by, abu, muhammad, lu, lu, al, kabir, of, aleppo, in, 1004, and, the, fatimid, sponsored, installment, of, aziz, al, dawla, as, the, city, s, emir, in, 1017, did, not, lead, to, a, resumption, of, hostilities, especially, because, al, kabir, continued, to, pay, tribute, to, the, byzantines, and, al, dawla, quickly, began, acting, as, an, independent, ruler, al, hakim, s, persecution, of, christians, in, his, realm, and, especially, the, 1009, destruction, of, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, at, his, orders, strained, relations, and, along, with, fatimid, interference, in, aleppo, provided, the, main, focus, of, fatimid, byzantine, diplomatic, relations, until, the, late, 1030s, basil, sought, to, restore, former, territories, of, the, byzantine, empire, at, the, start, of, the, second, millennium, he, fought, samuel, of, bulgaria, his, greatest, adversary, bulgaria, had, been, partly, subjugated, by, john, i, after, the, invasion, of, svyatoslav, i, of, kiev, but, parts, of, the, country, had, remained, outside, byzantine, control, under, the, leadership, of, samuel, and, his, brothers, because, the, bulgars, had, been, raiding, byzantine, lands, since, 976, the, byzantine, government, sought, to, cause, dissension, among, them, by, allowing, the, escape, of, their, captive, emperor, boris, ii, of, bulgaria, this, ploy, failed, so, basil, used, a, respite, from, his, conflict, with, the, nobility, to, lead, a, 30, 000, strong, army, into, bulgaria, and, besiege, sredets, sofia, in, 986, taking, losses, and, worried, about, the, loyalty, of, some, of, his, governors, basil, lifted, the, siege, and, returned, for, thrace, but, he, fell, into, an, ambush, and, suffered, a, serious, defeat, at, the, battle, of, the, gates, of, trajan, basil, escaped, with, the, help, of, his, varangian, guard, and, attempted, to, recover, his, losses, by, turning, samuel, s, brother, aron, against, him, aron, was, tempted, by, basil, s, offer, of, his, sister, anna, in, marriage, but, the, negotiations, failed, when, aron, discovered, the, bride, he, was, sent, was, an, imposter, by, 987, samuel, had, eliminated, aron, another, brother, of, samuel, called, david, was, killed, in, 976, by, the, vlachs, the, guards, of, caravans, between, prespa, and, kastoria, although, the, titular, emperor, roman, of, bulgaria, was, captured, in, 991, basil, lost, moesia, to, the, bulgarians, while, basil, was, distracted, with, internal, rebellions, and, recovering, the, military, situation, on, his, eastern, frontier, samuel, had, extended, his, rule, from, the, adriatic, sea, to, the, black, sea, recovering, most, of, the, territory, that, was, controlled, by, bulgaria, before, the, invasion, of, svyatoslav, he, also, conducted, damaging, raids, into, byzantine, territory, as, far, as, central, greece, in, 996, the, byzantine, general, nikephoros, ouranos, defeated, a, bulgarian, army, raid, at, the, battle, of, spercheios, in, thessaly, samuel, and, his, son, gabriel, narrowly, escaped, capture, beginning, in, 1000, basil, was, free, to, focus, on, a, war, of, conquest, against, bulgaria, which, he, fought, with, grinding, persistence, and, strategic, insight, in, 1000, the, byzantine, generals, nikephoros, xiphias, and, theodorokanos, took, the, former, bulgarian, capital, great, preslav, and, the, towns, lesser, preslav, and, pliskova, in, 1001, basil, operating, from, thessalonica, regained, control, of, vodena, verrhoia, and, servia, the, following, year, he, based, his, army, in, philippopolis, and, occupied, the, length, of, the, military, road, from, the, western, haemus, mountains, to, the, danube, cutting, off, communications, between, samuel, s, macedonian, heartland, and, paristrion, the, lands, south, of, the, lower, danube, following, this, success, basil, laid, siege, to, vidin, which, fell, after, a, prolonged, resistance, samuel, reacted, to, the, byzantine, campaign, by, launching, a, large, scale, raid, into, the, heart, of, byzantine, thrace, and, took, the, major, city, of, adrianople, by, surprise, after, turning, homeward, with, his, extensive, plunder, samuel, was, intercepted, near, skopje, by, a, byzantine, army, commanded, by, basil, whose, forces, stormed, the, bulgarian, camp, defeating, the, bulgarians, and, recovering, the, plunder, from, adrianople, skopje, surrendered, shortly, after, the, battle, and, basil, treated, its, governor, romanos, with, overt, kindness, in, 1005, the, governor, of, dyrrhachium, ashot, taronites, surrendered, his, city, to, the, byzantines, the, defection, of, dyrrhachium, completed, the, isolation, of, samuel, s, core, territories, in, the, highlands, of, western, macedonia, samuel, was, forced, into, an, almost, entirely, defensive, stance, he, extensively, fortified, the, passes, and, routes, from, the, coastlines, and, valleys, held, by, the, byzantines, to, the, territory, remaining, in, his, possession, during, the, next, few, years, the, byzantine, offensive, slowed, and, no, significant, gains, were, made, although, an, attempt, by, the, bulgarians, to, counter, attack, in, 1009, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, kreta, to, the, east, of, thessalonica, in, 1014, basil, was, ready, to, launch, a, campaign, aimed, at, destroying, bulgarian, resistance, on, 29, july, 1014, in, the, battle, of, kleidion, he, and, his, general, nikephoros, xiphias, outmaneuvered, the, bulgarian, army, which, was, defending, one, of, the, fortified, passes, samuel, avoided, capture, through, the, valor, of, his, son, gabriel, having, crushed, the, bulgarians, basil, exacted, his, vengeance, cruelly, he, was, said, to, have, captured, 15, 000, prisoners, and, fully, blinded, 99, of, every, 100, men, leaving, one, one, eyed, man, in, each, cohort, to, lead, the, rest, back, to, their, ruler, a, possible, reason, for, this, vengeance, was, that, in, byzantine, eyes, the, bulgarians, were, rebels, against, their, authority, and, blinding, was, the, usual, punishment, meted, out, to, rebels, samuel, was, struck, down, by, the, sight, of, his, blinded, army, and, died, two, days, later, on, 6, october, 1014, after, suffering, a, stroke, bulgaria, fought, on, for, four, more, years, its, resistance, fired, by, basil, s, cruelty, but, it, submitted, in, 1018, this, submission, was, the, result, of, continued, military, pressure, and, a, successful, diplomatic, campaign, aimed, at, dividing, and, suborning, the, bulgarian, leadership, this, victory, over, the, bulgarians, and, the, later, submission, of, the, serbs, fulfilled, one, of, basil, s, goals, the, empire, regained, its, ancient, danubian, frontier, for, the, first, time, in, 400, years, the, rulers, of, neighbouring, croatia, kre, imir, iii, and, gojslav, who, were, previously, allies, of, bulgaria, accepted, basil, s, supremacy, to, avoid, the, same, fate, as, bulgaria, basil, warmly, received, their, offers, of, vassalage, and, awarded, them, the, honorary, title, of, patrikios, croatia, remained, a, tributary, state, to, basil, until, his, death, in, 1025, before, returning, to, constantinople, basil, celebrated, his, triumph, in, athens, he, showed, considerable, statesmanship, in, his, treatment, of, the, defeated, bulgarians, giving, many, former, bulgarian, leaders, court, titles, positions, in, provincial, administration, and, high, commands, in, the, army, in, this, way, he,

bulgarian, taxes, in, kind, basil, s, successors, reversed, this, policy, a, decision, that, led, to, considerable, bulgarian, discontent, and, rebellion, later, in, the, 11th, century, although, the, kievan, rus, had, broken, the, power, of, the, khazar, khaganate, in, the, 960s, the, byzantines, had, not, been, able, to, fully, exploit, the, power, vacuum, and, restore, their, dominion, over,

george, who, was, young, and, ambitious, launched, a, campaign, to, restore, the, kuropalates, s, succession, to, georgia, and, occupied, tao, in, 1015, 1016, he, entered, in, an, alliance, with, the, fatimid, caliph, of, egypt, al, hakim, forcing, basil, to, refrain, from, an, acute, response, to, george, s, offensive, the, byzantines, were, also, involved, in, a, relentless, war, with, the, bulgarians, limiting, their, actions, to, the, west, as, soon, as, bulgaria, was, conquered, in, 1018, and, al, hakim, was, dead, basil, led, his, army, against, georgia, preparations, for, a, larger, scale, campaign, against, the, kingdom, of, georgia, were, set, beginning, with, the, re, fortification, of, theodosiopolis, in, late, 1021, basil, at, the, head, of, a, large, byzantine, army,

attempts, to, negotiate, the, conflict, failed, george, received, reinforcements, from, the, kakhetians, and, allied, himself, with, the, byzantine, commanders, nikephoros, phokas, barytrachelos, and, nikephoros, xiphias, in, their, abortive, insurrection, in, the, emperor, s, rear, in, december, george, s, ally, the, armenian, king, senekerim, of, vaspurakan, who, was, being, harassed, by, the, seljuk, turks, surrendered, his, kingdom, to, the, emperor, during, early, 1022, basil, launched, a, final, offensive, defeating, the, georgians, at, the, battle, of, svindax, menaced, both, by, land, and, sea, george, agreed, to, a, treaty, that, handed, over, tao, phasiane, kola, artaan, and, javakheti, and, left, his, infant, son, bagrat, as, basil, s, hostage, in, 992, basil, concluded, a, treaty, with, the, doge, of, venice, pietro, ii, orseolo, under, terms, reducing, venice, s, custom, duties, in, constantinople, from, 30, nomismata, to, 17, nomismata, in, return, the, venetians, agreed, to, transport, byzantine, troops, to, southern, italy, in, times, of, war, according, to, one, estimate, a, byzantine, landowning, farmer, might, expect, a, profit, of, 10, 2, nomismata, after, paying, dues, for, half, of, his, best, quality, land, basil, was, popular, with, the, country, farmers, the, class, that, produced, most, of, his, army, s, supplies, and, soldiers, to, assure, this, continued, basil, s, laws, protected, small, agrarian, property, owners, and, lowered, their, taxes, despite, the, almost, constant, wars, basil, s, reign, was, considered, an, era, of, relative, prosperity, for, the, class, seeking, to, protect, the, lower, and, middle, classes, basil, made, ruthless, war, upon, the, system, of, immense, estates, in, asia, minor, which, his, predecessor, romanos, i, had, endeavored, to, check, by, executing, a, legal, decree, in, january, 996, that, limited, rights, to, property, ownership, if, the, owner, of, an, estate, could, prove, that, he, claimed, his, estate, prior, to, the, novels, of, romanos, he, would, be, allowed, to, keep, it, if, a, person, had, illegally, seized, an, estate, following, the, novels, of, romanos, he, would, have, his, rights, to, the, estate, declared, null, and, the, legal, owners, could, reclaim, it, in, 1002, basil, also, introduced, the, allelengyon, tax, as, a, specific, law, obliging, the, dynatoi, wealthy, landholders, to, cover, for, the, arrears, of, poorer, tax, payers, though, it, proved, unpopular, with, the, wealthier, sections, of, byzantine, society, basil, did, not, abolish, the, tax, the, emperor, romanos, iii, abolished, the, allelengyon, in, 1028, by, 1025, basil, with, an, annual, revenue, of, 7, million, nomismata, was, able, to, amass, 14, 4, million, nomismata, or, 200, 000, pounds, 90, tonnes, of, gold, for, the, imperial, treasury, due, to, his, prudent, management, despite, his, attempts, to, control, the, power, of, the, aristocracy, they, again, took, control, of, the, government, following, his, death, basil, ii, was, praised, by, his, army, because, he, spent, most, of, his, reign, campaigning, with, it, rather, than, sending, orders, from, constantinople, as, had, most, of, his, predecessors, this, allowed, his, army, to, be, largely, supportive, of, him, often, making, his, stance, in, political, and, church, matters, unquestionable, he, lived, the, life, of, a, soldier, to, the, point, of, eating, the, same, daily, rations, as, the, rest, of, the, army, he, also, took, the, children, of, dead, army, officers, under, his, protection, and, offered, them, shelter, food, and, education, many, of, these, children, became, his, soldiers, and, officers, taking, the, places, of, their, fathers, one, of, them, isaac, komnenos, later, became, emperor, himself, basil, did, not, innovate, in, terms, of, military, organization, in, the, conquered, territories, he, introduced, both, the, small, themes, or, strategiai, centred, around, a, fortress, town, that, were, such, a, common, feature, of, the, 10th, century, reconquests, of, the, east, under, phokas, and, tzimiskes, as, well, as, the, extensive, regional, commands, under, a, doux, or, katepano, iberia, in, 1000, asprakania, or, upper, media, in, 1019, 22, paristrion, in, 1000, 20, bulgaria, in, 1018, and, sirmium, in, 1019, the, exact, size, of, the, army, under, basil, ii, is, unknown, but, estimates, put, it, as, high, as, 110, 000, men, excluding, the, imperial, tagmata, in, constantinople, a, considerable, force, compared, with, the, nominal, establishment, force, of, c, 120, 000, in, the, 9th, 10th, centuries, or, the, 150, 000, 160, 000, of, the, field, armies, under, justinian, i, at, the, same, time, however, under, basil, the, practice, began, of, relying, on, allied, states, most, notably, venice, for, naval, power, beginning, the, slow, decline, of, the, byzantine, navy, during, the, 11th, century, basil, ii, later, secured, the, annexation, of, the, sub, kingdoms, of, armenia, and, a, promise, that, its, capital, and, surrounding, regions, would, be, willed, to, byzantium, following, the, death, of, its, king, hovhannes, smbat, in, 1021, he, also, secured, the, cession, of, the, kingdom, of, vaspurakan, by, its, king, seneqerim, john, in, exchange, for, estates, in, sebasteia, basil, created, a, strongly, fortified, frontier, in, those, highlands, other, byzantine, forces, restored, much, of, southern, italy, which, had, been, lost, during, the, previous, 150, years, basil, was, preparing, a, military, expedition, to, recover, the, island, of, sicily, when, he, died, on, 15, december, 1025, having, had, the, longest, reign, among, any, byzantine, or, roman, emperor, at, the, time, of, his, death, the, empire, stretched, from, southern, italy, to, the, caucasus, and, from, the, danube, to, the, levant, which, was, its, greatest, territorial, extent, since, the, muslim, conquests, four, centuries, earlier, basil, was, to, be, buried, in, the, last, sarcophagus, available, in, the, rotunda, of, constantine, i, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, but, he, later, asked, his, brother, and, successor, constantine, viii, to, be, buried, in, the, church, of, st, john, the, theologian, i, e, the, evangelist, at, the, hebdomon, palace, complex, outside, the, walls, of, constantinople, the, epitaph, on, basil, s, tomb, celebrated, his, campaigns, and, victories, his, final, resting, place, carried, the, following, inscription, from, the, day, that, the, king, of, heaven, called, upon, me, to, become, the, emperor, the, great, overlord, of, the, world, no, one, saw, my, spear, lie, idle, i, stayed, alert, throughout, my, life, and, protected, the, children, of, the, new, rome, valiantly, campaigning, both, in, the, west, and, at, the, outposts, of, the, east, o, man, seeing, now, my, tomb, here, reward, me, for, my, campaigns, with, your, prayers, in, 1260, during, the, unsuccessful, nicean, byzantine, siege, of, constantinople, then, held, by, the, latin, empire, a, corpse, was, found, upright, in, a, corner, of, the, church, of, st, john, the, evangelist, with, a, shepherd, s, flute, placed, in, its, mouth, an, inscription, allowed, the, nicaean, soldiers, to, identify, the, corpse, as, the, remains, of, basil, ii, the, body, of, basil, ii, was, transferred, to, the, monastery, of, the, saviour, at, selymbria, the, following, year, constantinople, was, recovered, by, the, byzantines, an, assessment, of, the, reign, in, the, eyes, of, the, subsequent, generations, is, given, by, psellos, he, crushed, rebellions, subdued, the, feudal, landowners, conquered, the, enemies, of, the, empire, notably, in, the, danubian, provinces, and, the, east, everywhere, the, might, of, roman, arms, was, respected, and, feared, the, treasury, was, overflowing, with, the, accumulated, plunder, of, basil, s, campaigns, even, the, lamp, of, learning, despite, the, emperor, s, known, indifference, was, burning, still, if, somewhat, dimly, the, lot, of, ordinary, folk, in, constantinople, must, have, been, pleasant, enough, for, most, of, them, life, was, gay, and, colourful, and, if, the, city, s, defensive, fortifications, were, at, some, points, in, disrepair, they, had, no, cause, to, dread, attacks, basil, ii, s, reign, is, one, of, the, most, significant, in, byzantine, history, his, constant, military, campaigns, led, to, the, zenith, of, byzantine, power, in, the, middle, ages, the, restoration, of, the, danubian, frontier, helped, establish, a, more, stable, and, secure, border, for, the, empire, in, europe, maintaining, a, stronger, barrier, against, hungarian, and, pecheneg, raiders, the, conquest, of, bulgaria, and, the, submission, of, the, south, slavs, created, relative, peace, for, the, empire, s, balkan, lands, keeping, larger, cities, including, constantinople, safe, from, the, previously, frequent, sieges, and, looting, basil, s, military, experience, that, allowed, him, to, eventually, turn, the, war, against, bulgaria, in, the, byzantine, empire, s, favor, were, gained, through, the, revolts, of, phokas, and, skleros, in, anatolia, that, challenged, his, throne, and, sometimes, got, close, to, deposing, him, basil, s, creation, of, the, varangian, guard, provided, him, and, his, successors, with, an, elite, mercenary, force, capable, of, changing, battle, outcomes, and, boosting, morale, that, became, feared, by, the, emperor, s, enemies, at, this, time, the, macedonian, renaissance, was, taking, effect, seeing, the, rise, of, classical, greek, scholarship, being, assimilated, into, christian, art, and, the, study, of, ancient, greek, philosophy, being, widespread, the, studies, of, these, subjects, and, the, enlargement, projects, of, the, emperors, greatly, expanded, the, library, of, the, university, of, constantinople, which, again, established, itself, as, the, main, source, of, learning, for, its, day, though, he, was, not, a, man, of, literature, basil, was, a, relatively, pious, ruler, who, involved, himself, in, the, construction, of, churches, monasteries, and, to, some, extent, cities, literary, works, eulogies, and, poems, were, made, by, the, great, cities, of, the, byzantine, empire, that, mostly, tried, to, juxtapose, the, classic, past, of, kingdoms, and, empires, with, the, new, expansion, of, basil, ii, in, which, he, was, compared, with, many, important, figures, of, the, east, such, as, cyrus, the, great, and, artaxerxes, he, was, also, particularly, compared, with, alexander, the, great, who, was, believed, to, be, basil, s, ancestor, classical, works, such, as, the, persians, by, the, ancient, greek, tragedian, aeschylus, were, among, the, most, recited, in, the, empire, during, the, expansion, given, the, different, confrontations, against, the, caliphates, that, the, byzantines, indiscriminately, and, classically, called, medes, despite, the, great, expansion, during, his, reign, his, military, and, non, scholastic, character, led, him, to, be, criticized, and, related, to, the, ancient, spartan, monarchs, or, tyrants, who, at, that, time, were, remembered, for, being, men, of, action, cruelty, and, decision, who, like, basil, paid, little, attention, to, promoting, the, arts, or, literary, culture, and, preferred, a, military, environment, basil, ii, lacked, heirs, due, to, the, dearth, of, cousins, found, within, the, macedonian, dynasty, so, he, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, constantine, and, his, family, who, proved, to, be, ineffective, rulers, nevertheless, fifty, years, of, prosperity, and, intellectual, growth, followed, because, the, funds, of, state, were, full, the, borders, were, safe, from, intruders, and, the, empire, remained, the, most, powerful, political, entity, of, the, age, at, the, end, of, basil, ii, s, reign, the, byzantine, empire, had, a, population, of, approximately, 12, million, people, although, they, were, beneficial, basil, s, achievements, were, reversed, very, quickly, many, of, the, georgian, armenian, and, fatimid, campaigns, were, undone, after, the, succession, crisis, and, eventual, civil, war, after, the, battle, of, manzikert, in, 1071, because, many, of, the, empire, s, governors, went, to, the, capital, with, their, soldiers, to, seize, power, after, the, capture, of, emperor, romanos, iv, the, anatolian, frontier, was, largely, left, undefended, against, the, seljuk, empire, the, normans, permanently, pushed,
