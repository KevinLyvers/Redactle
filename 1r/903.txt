famous, in, the, buddhist, world, having, been, inscribed, onto, many, buddhist, statues, according, to, philosopher, paul, carus, the, stanza, breaks, away, from, the, idea, of, divine, intervention, prevalent, in, ancient, brahmanism, at, the, time, and, instead, teaches, that, the, origin, and, end, of, all, things, depends, on, its, causation, following, the, teaching, upati, ya, attained,

the, two, friends, along, with, a, large, chunk, of, sa, jaya, s, disciples, then, ordained, as, monks, under, the, buddha, with, everybody, in, the, group, becoming, arhats, that, day, except, for, upati, ya, and, kolita, nyanaponika, thera, states, that, the, friends, required, longer, preparatory, periods, before, enlightening, in, order, to, fulfill, their, roles, as, chief, disciples, several, texts, describe, the, ordination, with, miraculous, elements, such, as, the, disciples, clothes, suddenly, being, replaced, with, buddhist, robes, and, their, hair, falling, out, on, its, own, after, ordaining, upati, ya, started, being, called, riputra, pali, s, riputta, and, kolita, started, being, called, maudgaly, yana, pali, moggall, na, after, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, ordained, the, buddha, declared, them, his, two, chief, disciples, pali, aggasavaka, following, the, tradition, of, appointing, a, pair, of, chief, disciples, as, the, past, buddhas, did, according, to, buddhist, belief, since, they, were, newly, ordained, some, of, the, monks, in, the, assembly, felt, offended, but, the, buddha, explained, that, he, gave, them, the, roles, because, they, had, made, the, resolve, to, become, the, chief, disciples, many, lifetimes, ago, maudgaly, yana, attained, arhatship, seven, days, after, ordaining, following, intense, meditation, training, riputra, attained, arhatship, two, weeks, after, ordaining, while, fanning, the, buddha, as, the, buddha, was, delivering, the, vedan, pariggaha, sutta, to, a, wandering, ascetic, pali, texts, state, that, the, ascetic, was, riputra, s, nephew, but, chinese, tibetan, and, sanskrit, texts, state, he, was, riputra, s, uncle, according, to, commentaries, such, as, the, atthakatha, riputra, took, longer, to, achieve, enlightenment, than, maudgaly, yana, because, his, knowledge, had, to, be, more, thorough, as, first, chief, disciple, and, thus, required, more, preparation, time, riputra, is, considered, to, have, been, the, buddha, s, first, chief, disciple, foremost, in, wisdom, a, title, he, shared, with, the, nun, k, em, pali, khem, he, shared, the, title, of, chief, male, disciple, with, maudgaly, yana, together, described, in, the, mah, pad, na, sutta, as, the, chief, pair, of, disciples, the, excellent, pair, pali, s, vakayuga, agga, bhaddayuga, in, the, mahavagga, the, buddha, declared, his, two, chief, male, disciples, as, being, foremost, in, wisdom, and, foremost, in, psychic, powers, referencing, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, respectively, texts, describe, that, none, of, the, buddha, s, other, disciples, could, answer, questions, that, maudgaly, yana, was, able, to, answer, while, maudgaly, yana, was, unable, to, answer, questions, riputra, was, able, to, answer, buddhist, tradition, maintains, that, the, first, chief, disciple, riputra, customarily, sat, to, the, buddha, s, right, hand, side, while, the, second, chief, disciple, maudgaly, yana, sat, to, the, left, the, disciples, have, thus, been, stylized, as, the, right, hand, and, left, hand, disciples, of, the, buddha, in, buddhist, tradition, and, art, accordingly, as, the, first, chief, disciple, riputra, s, role, was, the, systematization, and, analysis, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, the, buddhist, canon, often, shows, riputra, asking, the, buddha, questions, and, entreating, the, buddha, to, teach, as, well, as, himself, clarifying, points, and, questioning, disciples, in, some, cases, seemingly, to, test, the, knowledge, of, fellow, disciples, the, buddha, would, often, suggest, a, topic, and, have, riputra, elaborate, and, deliver, a, sermon, on, it, in, two, discourses, recorded, in, the, tripitaka, the, dasuttara, sutta, and, the, sa, g, ti, sutta, the, buddha, declared, he, needed, to, rest, his, back, and, had, riputra, teach, in, his, place, while, the, buddha, listened, in, the, audience, his, ability, to, teach, the, dharma, earned, him, the, title, of, general, of, the, dharma, sanskrit, dharmasenapati, buddhist, texts, indicate, that, riputra, still, had, some, flaws, however, in, the, catuma, sutta, when, a, group, of, young, monks, made, noise, and, were, ordered, by, the, buddha, to, leave, the, buddha, reprimanded, riputra, for, not, concluding, that, it, was, the, chief, disciples, responsibility, to, look, after, the, monks, something, maudgaly, yana, was, able, to, conclude, on, another, occasion, the, buddha, reprimanded, riputra, for, teaching, the, dying, dhana, jani, in, a, way, that, led, him, to, rebirth, in, the, brahma, realm, rather, than, teaching, in, a, way, that, led, to, enlightenment, riputra, assumed, a, leadership, role, in, the, buddha, s, monastic, community, or, sangha, buddhist, texts, describe, that, riputra, routinely, took, charge, of, monastic, affairs, usually, handled, by, the, buddha, himself, such, as, attending, to, sick, monks, or, visiting, lay, followers, before, their, deaths, in, one, instance, when, a, group, of, monks, planned, to, travel, elsewhere, the, buddha, told, them, to, ask, riputra, for, permission, first, riputra, was, the, first, disciple, of, the, buddha, who, was, asked, to, ordain, monks, in, his, place, with, the, buddha, giving, him, the, ordination, procedure, he, was, also, entrusted, to, ordain, the, buddha, s, son, rahula, when, riputra, trained, pupils, he, gave, them, material, and, spiritual, help, and, assigned, them, an, object, of, meditation, in, the, saccavibhanga, sutta, the, buddha, compared, riputra, to, a, mother, who, gives, birth, to, a, child, while, comparing, maudgaly, yana, to, a, nurse, who, raises, a, child, riputra, would, train, students, to, sotapanna, the, first, stage, of, enlightenment, and, maudgaly, yana, would, train, students, to, arhatship, the, highest, stage, of, enlightenment, however, nyanaponika, thera, notes, that, there, are, several, individual, cases, where, riputra, guided, monks, to, the, higher, stages, of, enlightenment, as, well, buddhist, texts, portray, riputra, as, someone, who, took, an, active, role, in, debating, and, converting, heretics, considered, to, have, been, one, of, his, great, prerogatives, in, the, m, lasarv, stiv, da, tradition, when, the, six, heretical, teachers, of, the, time, challenged, the, buddhists, to, a, contest, the, buddha, had, riputra, contend, against, them, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, state, that, riputra, used, psychic, powers, to, create, a, huge, storm, and, transform, himself, into, various, forms, subduing, the, rival, teachers, and, converting, the, residents, of, savatthi, when, the, monk, devadatta, created, a, schism, in, the, buddha, s, monastic, community, and, led, some, of, the, buddha, s, disciples, away, riputra, played, a, key, role, in, restoring, the, community, according, to, texts, upon, hearing, about, the, schism, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, pretended, to, join, devadatta, s, community, after, the, chief, disciples, joined, devadatta, claimed, to, have, had, a, backache, and, had, riputra, preach, in, his, place, but, devadatta, fell, asleep, and, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, used, the, opportunity, to, get, the, following, to, return, to, the, buddha, buddhist, texts, generally, credit, the, establishment, of, the, monastic, rules, to, riputra, with, riputra, being, the, one, to, ask, the, buddha, to, create, the, rules, when, riputra, asked, the, buddha, he, said, he, would, lay, them, down, at, the, right, time, riputra, was, known, for, his, conscientiousness, and, meticulous, adherence, to, monastic, rules, in, one, story, riputra, became, ill, with, an, ailment, that, could, be, treated, with, garlic, but, refused, it, because, the, buddha, had, previously, laid, down, a, rule, forbidding, monks, to, eat, garlic, with, riputra, only, taking, it, after, the, buddha, rescinded, the, rule, in, another, story, riputra, found, that, meal, cakes, tended, to, make, him, greedy, and, then, made, a, vow, to, abstain, from, them, a, buddhist, commentary, describes, that, one, time, when, the, other, monks, had, left, to, collect, alms, riputra, meticulously, cleaned, and, organized, the, monastery, to, keep, heretics, from, criticizing, the, disciples, several, buddhist, texts, relate, that, riputra, was, reborn, as, a, snake, in, a, previous, life, and, that, this, was, the, reason, for, some, of, his, stubbornness, in, a, mah, s, ghika, text, the, buddha, punished, riputra, by, making, him, stand, in, the, sun, for, failing, to, prevent, some, monks, from, making, incorrect, remarks, when, the, other, monks, later, asked, the, buddha, to, stop, the, punishment, the, buddha, said, that, riputra, s, decision, to, receive, the, punishment, could, not, be, changed, just, as, he, was, unwilling, to, change, his, mind, when, he, was, a, snake, in, a, mah, saka, text, riputra, refused, to, take, a, type, of, fruit, even, when, prescribed, as, medicine, after, another, monk, suspected, him, of, sneaking, delicious, food, the, buddha, likewise, references, riputra, s, life, as, a, snake, to, explain, his, stubbornness, although, maudgaly, yana, is, described, as, having, been, foremost, in, psychic, powers, buddhist, texts, state, that, riputra, also, exhibited, such, powers, himself, in, various, texts, riputra, is, reported, to, have, exhibited, several, psychic, abilities, such, as, levitation, and, the, ability, to, visit, other, realms, of, existence, as, well, as, abilities, common, among, arhats, such, as, recalling, past, lives, and, clairvoyance, in, one, story, a, yaksha, or, spirit, hit, riputra, in, the, head, while, he, was, meditating, when, maudgaly, yana, saw, the, incident, and, came, to, ask, riputra, if, he, was, okay, riputra, stated, he, didn, t, even, notice, the, blow, and, suffered, only, a, minor, headache, maudgaly, yana, then, praised, riputra, for, his, psychic, abilities, by, being, able, to, sustain, a, blow, with, little, notice, described, in, the, patisambhidamagga, text, as, an, example, of, the, power, of, intervention, by, concentration, pali, sam, dhivipph, ra, iddhi, in, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, descended, to, hell, to, give, devadatta, the, prophecy, that, he, will, become, a, pratyekabuddha, in, the, future, during, the, visit, it, is, said, that, maudgaly, yana, attempted, to, relieve, the, suffering, of, those, in, hell, by, creating, rain, but, the, rain, dispersed, after, riputra, saw, this, he, created, a, rain, that, did, relieve, the, suffering, of, those, in, hell, using, a, wisdom, based, meditation, in, another, m, lasarv, stiv, da, text, the, buddha, sent, maudgaly, yana, to, retrieve, riputra, who, was, doing, sewing, work, when, riputra, stated, he, would, go, after, his, sewing, work, was, complete, maudgaly, yana, attempted, to, force, him, to, come, by, using, his, psychic, powers, to, shake, the, ground, but, riputra, was, unaffected, when, riputra, told, him, to, return, first, maudgaly, yana, went, back, to, the, buddha, and, found, that, riputra, had, already, arrived, when, maudgaly, yana, saw, this, he, stated, that, the, power, of, psychic, abilities, was, no, match, for, the, power, of, wisdom, buddhist, texts, all, state, that, riputra, died, shortly, before, the, buddha, with, texts, generally, indicating, he, died, in, his, hometown, according, to, p, li, commentaries, riputra, arose, from, meditation, one, day, and, realized, through, his, meditative, insight, that, the, chief, disciples, were, supposed, to, achieve, parinirvana, before, the, buddha, and, that, he, had, seven, more, days, to, live, riputra, then, traveled, to, his, hometown, to, teach, his, mother, who, was, yet, to, be, converted, to, buddhism, after, he, converted, his, mother, riputra, died, peacefully, on, the, full, moon, day, of, kartika, a, few, months, before, the, buddha, according, to, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, however, it, is, said, that, riputra, achieved, paranirvana, voluntarily, because, he, didn, t, want, to, witness, the, buddha, s, death, in, some, accounts, he, was, also, motivated, by, maudgaly, yana, intending, to, achieve, paranirvana, after, being, beaten, and, mortally, injured, by, a, rival, religious, group, in, the, sarv, stiv, da, account, riputra, and, maudgaly, yana, both, achieved, paranirvana, voluntarily, on, the, same, day, because, they, didn, t, want, to, witness, the, buddha, s, death, in, several, versions, of, the, story, various, heavenly, beings, from, buddhist, cosmology, are, said, to, have, come, to, pay, respect, to, riputra, near, his, time, of, death, a, funeral, was, held, for, riputra, in, the, city, of, rajgir, where, his, remains, were, cremated, his, relics, were, then, brought, by, riputra, s, assistant, cunda, to, the, buddha, in, r, vast, in, the, anupada, sutta, the, buddha, gave, a, eulogy, of, riputra, praising, his, intellect, and, virtue, according, to, a, dighanikaya, commentary, the, buddha, enshrined, riputra, s, relics, in, a, cetiya, at, jetavana, in, m, lasarv, stiv, da, texts, the, relics, were, given, to, the, lay, disciple, anathapindika, and, it, is, him, who, builds, a, stupa, and, enshrines, the, relics, at, jetavana, riputra, is, said, to, have, played, a, key, role, in, the, development, of, the, abhidharma, texts, of, the, buddhist, tripitaka, buddhist, scholar, monks, rewata, dhamma, and, bhikkhu, bodhi, describe, the, abhidharma, as, an, abstract, and, highly, technical, systemization, of, the, doctrine, according, to, theravada, tradition, the, abhidharma, or, higher, dharma, is, said, to, have, been, preached, by, the, buddha, to, devas, while, he, was, spending, the, rainy, season, in, tavatimsa, heaven, it, is, said, that, the, buddha, returned, to, earth, daily, to, give, a, summary, to, riputra, who, classified, and, reordered, the, teachings, and, relayed, it, to, his, disciples, in, what, would, become, the, abhidharma, pitaka, various, sets, of, the, sarvastivada, school, of, buddhism, however, attribute, each, of, the, seven, books, of, the, abhidharma, to, different, authors, with, riputra, being, attributed, as, the, author, of, just, the, sangitiparyaya, in, the, chinese, sarvastivada, tradition, and, as, the, author, of, the, dharmaskandha, in, the, sanskrit, and, tibetan, sarvastivada, traditions, in, the, vatsiputriya, tradition, a, subset, of, the, sarvastivada, school, riputra, is, said, to, have, transmitted, the, abhidharma, to, rahula, who, later, transmitted, it, to, the, school, s, founder, vatsiputra, as, the, author, of, the, abhidharma, in, buddhist, tradition, riputra, is, considered, to, be, the, patron, saint, of, the, abhidharmists, french, religion, writer, andr, migot, argues, that, the, abhidharma, was, formulated, no, earlier, than, the, time, of, emperor, asoka, and, thus, cannot, really, be, attributed, to, the, historic, riputra, at, least, not, the, version, known, by, modern, scholars, english, historian, edward, j, thomas, dates, the, development, of, the, abhidharma, as, being, sometime, between, the, third, century, bce, and, the, first, century, ce, however, migot, states, that, a, simpler, version, of, the, abhidharma, likely, existed, in, early, buddhism, before, it, evolved, and, was, written, down, in, its, current, form, migot, points, to, the, mention, of, the, matrka, pitaka, in, cullavagga, texts, as, the, precursor, to, the, abhidharma, pitaka, migot, argues, that, the, matrka, pitaka, recited, by, mah, k, yapa, at, the, first, buddhist, council, according, to, ashokavadana, texts, likely, began, as, a, condensed, version, of, buddhist, doctrine, that, developed, over, time, with, metaphysical, aspects, to, become, the, abhidharma, thomas, also, states, that, the, abhidharma, had, earlier, roots, and, was, developed, based, on, existing, material, likely, a, method, of, discussing, the, principles, of, the, buddha, s, teachings, according, to, thomas, different, buddhist, schools, compiled, their, own, abhidharma, works, separately, but, based, it, on, common, existing, material, riputra, frequently, appears, in, mahayana, sutras, often, asking, the, buddha, to, teach, or, engaging, in, the, dialogue, himself, migot, states, that, it, is, significant, that, riputra, has, a, continuity, in, mahayana, texts, as, most, of, the, buddha, s, great, disciples, are, usually, absent, from, mahayana, literature, migot, credits, the, importance, of, riputra, in, the, early, vatsiputriya, buddhist, school, with, why, riputra, often, appeared, in, mahayana, texts, while, depictions, of, riputra, in, the, p, li, canon, generally, portray, him, as, a, wise, and, powerful, arhat, second, only, to, the, buddha, mahayana, texts, give, him, a, wider, range, of, depictions, some, mahayana, sutras, portray, him, as, a, great, buddhist, disciple, while, others, portray, him, as, a, counterpoint, with, insufficient, understanding, of, mahayana, doctrine, representative, of, the, hinayana, tradition, buddhist, studies, scholar, donald, s, lopez, jr, describes, the, latter, as, intentional, irony, aimed, at, depicting, how, profound, mahayana, doctrine, is, by, showing, that, even, the, wisest, hinayana, disciple, had, difficulty, understanding, it, in, the, vimalak, rti, s, tra, riputra, is, depicted, as, being, unable, to, grasp, mahayana, doctrines, such, as, non, duality, and, emptiness, in, the, sutra, a, goddess, listening, to, vimalak, rti, scatters, flowers, which, fall, onto, riputra, s, robes, not, wanting, to, break, the, monastic, rules, which, forbid, decorating, oneself, with, flowers, he, tries, to, remove, them, but, is, unable, to, the, goddess, then, accuses, riputra, of, being, attached, to, the, duality, of, what, is, proper, and, improper, later, in, the, sutra, riputra, asks, that, if, the, goddess, is, so, spiritually, advanced, why, doesn, t, she, transform, out, of, her, female, state, indicative, of, cultural, sexism, the, goddess, responds, by, using, her, powers, to, switch, bodies, with, riputra, to, demonstrate, that, male, and, female, is, just, an, illusion, because, according, to, mahayana, doctrine, all, things, are, empty, and, so, male, and, female, don, t, really, exist, in, praj, p, ramit, sutras, riputra, is, often, depicted, as, the, counterpoint, to, the, true, meaning, of, praj, p, ramit, in, the, astasahasrika, praj, p, ramit, sutra, riputra, is, portrayed, as, being, unable, to, understand, the, ultimate, meaning, of, praj, p, ramit, and, instead, must, be, instructed, by, the, disciple, subh, ti, according, to, buddhist, scholar, edward, conze, the, sutra, depicts, riputra, as, being, preoccupied, with, dualities, making, him, unable, to, grasp, the, true, meaning, of, prajnaparamita, in, the, mahaprajnaparamita, sutra, riputra, is, one, of, the, principal, interlocutors, asking, questions, and, being, instructed, conze, states, that, riputra, has, to, be, instructed, in, this, sutra, because, despite, his, great, wisdom, prajnaparamita, doctrine, was, too, advanced, for, his, comprehension, the, da, zhidu, lun, commentary, to, the, sutra, describes, riputra, as, someone, who, pursued, the, bodhisattva, path, in, a, past, life, but, gave, up, and, turned, to, the, r, vaka, path, after, donating, his, eye, to, a, beggar, who, threw, the, eye, on, the, ground, religious, studies, scholar, douglas, osto, argues, that, riputra, is, portrayed, as, such, in, praj, p, ramit, sutras, due, to, his, association, with, the, abhidharma, which, teaches, that, dharmas, are, the, final, reality, this, is, in, contrast, to, the, core, teachings, of, praj, p, ramit, sutras, which, teach, that, all, dharmas, are, empty, thus, making, riputra, the, ideal, counterpoint, riputra, plays, a, major, role, in, the, heart, sutra, where, the, teaching, is, directed, at, him, riputra, prompts, the, teaching, of, the, sutra, by, asking, the, mahayana, bodhisattva, avalokite, vara, how, to, practice, wisdom, avalokite, vara, s, response, to, riputra, then, makes, up, the, body, of, the, sutra, when, avalokite, vara, finishes, the, sutra, the, buddha, shows, approval, of, the, teaching, and, riputra, avalokite, vara, and, the, audience, then, rejoice, in, the, lotus, sutra, the, buddha, starts, talking, about, the, higher, wisdom, of, buddhas, and, his, use, of, skillful, means, sanskrit, up, ya, to, teach, the, dharma, which, leaves, the, arhats, in, the, assembly, confused, riputra, then, asks, the, buddha, to, explain, his, teachings, for, the, benefit, of, other, beings, prompting, the, buddha, to, teach, the, lotus, sutra, later, in, the, sutra, the, buddha, explains, that, riputra, had, followed, the, bodhisattva, path, in, past, lives, but, had, forgotten, and, followed, the, r, vaka, path, in, this, life, the, buddha, then, assures, riputra, that, he, will, also, achieve, buddhahood, and, declares, that, riputra, will, become, the, future, buddha, padmaprabha, in, the, listing, of, the, great, arhats, in, the, assembly, at, the, beginning, of, the, longer, sukh, vat, vy, ha, s, tra, riputra, is, mentioned, as, the, fifteenth, of, the, great, arhats, while, in, the, shorter, sukh, vat, vy, ha, s, tra, he, is, placed, as, the, first, according, to, accounts, from, the, 7th, century, chinese, pilgrim, xuanzang, riputra, s, as, well, as, maudgaly, yana, s, relics, could, be, found, in, the, indian, city, of, mathura, in, stupas, built, by, king, asoka, however, as, of, 1999, no, archaeological, reports, had, confirmed, such, findings, at, the, sites, mentioned, by, either, chinese, pilgrims, or, buddhist, texts, although, findings, were, made, at, other, sites, in, 1851, archaeologists, alexander, cunningham, and, lieutenant, fred, c, maisey, discovered, a, pair, of, sandstone, boxes, with, encased, bone, fragments, inside, during, an, excavation, of, one, of, the, stupas, in, the, city, of, sanchi, with, riputra, s, and, maudgaly, yana, s, names, inscribed, on, them, in, br, hm, text, riputra, s, casket, contained, pieces, of, sandalwood, which, cunningham, believed, was, part, of, riputra, s, funeral, pyre, riputra, s, box, was, positioned, at, the, south, while, maudgaly, yana, s, was, positioned, at, the, north, according, to, cunningham, people, in, ancient, india, sat, facing, the, east, during, religious, ceremonies, and, even, used, the, word, east, para, for, front, as, well, as, the, word, south, dakshina, for, right, and, the, word, north, vami, for, left, meaning, the, positioning, of, the, caskets, symbolized, each, disciple, s, relative, positions, as, right, and, left, hand, disciple, respectively, this, positioning, has, also, been, explained, by, the, fact, that, the, buddha, traditionally, sat, facing, the, east, which, would, make, the, south, his, right, hand, side, and, the, north, his, left, hand, side, another, excavation, by, cunningham, and, maisey, at, stupas, in, the, nearby, town, of, satdh, ra, found, another, pair, of, caskets, with, encased, bone, fragments, with, the, two, chief, disciples, names, inscribed, cunningham, concluded, that, the, relics, were, enshrined, in, stupas, near, rajagaha, after, the, disciples, deaths, until, the, time, of, king, asoka, who, then, redistributed, them, in, stupas, throughout, india, scholars, have, also, theorized, that, a, sunga, king, may, have, also, have, done, a, similar, redistribution, of, the, relics, of, the, buddha, and, his, leading, disciples, and, built, stupas, such, as, the, one, in, sanchi, to, enshrine, them, cunningham, and, maisey, later, divided, their, findings, among, each, other, with, maisey, bringing, the, satdh, ra, relics, to, britain, and, eventually, loaning, them, to, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, in, london, in, 1866, the, relics, were, eventually, purchased, by, the, museum, in, 1921, from, maisley, s, son, cunningham, brought, his, findings, to, britain, on, two, ships, one, of, which, sank, thus, the, sanchi, relics, are, believed, to, have, been, lost, however, historian, torkel, brekke, argues, that, maisey, took, all, the, relics, with, him, and, thus, the, sanchi, relics, went, to, britain, along, with, the, satdh, ra, ones, in, the, early, 20th, century, buddhist, organizations, in, india, and, burma, began, pressuring, the, british, government, to, return, the, relics, to, india, where, they, can, be, properly, venerated, although, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, initially, resisted, the, british, government, eventually, ordered, them, to, return, the, relics, for, diplomatic, reasons, the, relics, were, transferred, to, predominantly, buddhist, sri, lanka, in, 1947, in, accordance, with, an, agreement, made, with, buddhist, organizations, where, they, were, put, on, temporary, display, at, the, colombo, museum, in, 1949, the, relics, were, sent, to, india, where, they, were, put, on, tour, around, northern, india, and, various, parts, of, asia, in, 1950, the, relics, were, sent, on, tour, to, burma, with, burmese, prime, minister, u, nu, later, asking, india, for, a, portion, of, the, relics, indian, prime, minister, jawaharlal, nehru, agreed, to, make, a, permanent, loan, of, a, portion, of, the, relics, to, burma, where, they, were, enshrined, in, the, kaba, aye, pagoda, in, 1952, sri, lanka, also, obtained, a, portion, of, the, relics, which, were, brought, from, sanchi, in, 1952, and, kept, at, the, maha, bodhi, society, in, sri, lanka, the, portion, of, the, relics, that, remained, in, india, were, enshrined, at, the, chethiyagiri, vihara, in, sanchi, also, in, 1952, as, the, chief, disciple, of, the, buddha, riputra, is, considered, to, be, a, particularly, important, figure, in, buddhism, especially, in, the, theravada, tradition, according, to, buddhist, academic, reginald, ray, riputra, was, the, greatest, arhat, in, the, pali, canon, and, is, ranked, in, the, canon, as, being, close, to, a, second, buddha, in, one, text, he, is, referred, to, as, king, of, the, dharma, sanskrit, dharmaraja, a, title, generally, reserved, for, the, buddha, and, is, described, in, several, texts, as, one, who, spins, the, wheel, of, the, dharma, a, prerogative, generally, associated, with, buddhas, in, the, pali, canon, riputra, is, credited, as, the, main, expounder, of, several, suttas, due, to, the, buddha, trusting, in, his, profound, teaching, ability, indologist, alex, wayman, describes, riputra, as, being, exemplary, of, the, four, brahma, vih, r, s, and, credits, these, virtues, with, why, the, buddha, entrusted, him, with, leadership, of, the, sangha, in, buddhist, art, he, is, often, depicted, alongside, the, buddha, and, maudgaly, yana, with, riputra, usually, depicted, on, the, buddha, s, right, hand, side, and, maudgaly, yana, usually, depicted, on, the, buddha, s, left, hand, side, according, to, nyanaponika, thera, this, imagery, symbolizes, the, relative, positions, they, held, in, life, with, riputra, being, the, buddha, s, right, hand, monk, in, mahayana, buddhism, this, iconography, of, flanking, the, buddha, on, his, right, and, left, is, sometimes, used, for, other, figures, as, well, such, as, the, mahayana, bodhisattvas, samantabhadra, and, ma, ju, r, or, the, disciples, nanda, and, mah, k, yapa, in, burma, riputra, is, believed, to, grant, wisdom, to, worshippers, and, is, one, of, eight, arhats, commonly, shown, devotion, to, in, protective, rituals, riputra, is, notable, for, being, representative, of, scholarship, and, settled, monasticism, rather, than, the, forest, buddhism, that, most, of, the, buddha, s, principal, disciples, are, associated, with, ray, describes, riputra, as, the, prototypical, buddhist, saint, who, embodied, the, ideal, of, the, southern, buddhism, that, developed, in, ancient, kosambi, however, ray, points, out, that, some, pali, texts, such, as, the, udana, and, theragatha, portray, riputra, as, a, forest, saint, he, concludes, that, there, are, at, least, two, traditions, linked, to, him, in, pali, texts, forest, and, scholarly, migot, identifies, texts, that, exclude, riputra, s, scholastic, character, as, the, earliest, sources, and, goes, on, to, argue, that, the, historic, riputra, was, different, from, the, person, preserved, in, the, pali, canon, he, argues, that, riputra, was, venerated, as, a, saint, in, the, ancient, kosambi, region, and, that, the, early, sthavira, school, of, buddhism, developed, his, scholarly, side, in, accordance, to, the, tradition, s, values, in, the, region, at, the, time, indicating, that, riputra, may, originally, have, been, a, forest, saint, ray, states, that, while, it, is, possible, riputra, s, scholastic, character, was, the, result, of, texts, that, were, added, later, there, is, insufficient, evidence, to, conclude, to, this
