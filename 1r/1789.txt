arthur, cayley, frs, k, e, l, i, 16, august, 1821, 26, january, 1895, was, a, british, mathematician, who, worked, mostly, on, algebra, he, helped, found, the, modern, british, school, of, pure, mathematics, and, was, a, professor, at, trinity, college, cambridge, for, 35, years, he, postulated, what, is, now, known, as, the, cayley, hamilton, theorem, that, every, square, matrix, is, a, root, of, its, own, characteristic, polynomial, and, verified, it, for, matrices, of, order, 2, and, 3, he, was, the, first, to, define, the, concept, of, an, abstract, group, a, set, with, a, binary, operation, satisfying, certain, laws, as, opposed, to, variste, galois, concept, of, permutation, groups, in, group, theory, cayley, tables, cayley, graphs, and, cayley, s, theorem, are, named, in, his, honour, as, well, as, cayley, s, formula, in, combinatorics, arthur, cayley, was, born, in, richmond, london, england, on, 16, august, 1821, his, father, henry, cayley, was, a, distant, cousin, of, george, cayley, the, aeronautics, engineer, innovator, and, descended, from, an, ancient, yorkshire, family, he, settled, in, saint, petersburg, russia, as, a, merchant, his, mother, was, maria, antonia, doughty, daughter, of, william, doughty, according, to, some, writers, she, was, russian, but, her, father, s, name, indicates, an, english, origin, his, brother, was, the, linguist, charles, bagot, cayley, arthur, spent, his, first, eight, years, in, saint, petersburg, in, 1829, his, parents, were, settled, permanently, at, blackheath, london, where, arthur, attended, a, private, school, at, age, 14, he, was, sent, to, king, s, college, school, the, young, cayley, enjoyed, complex, maths, problems, and, the, school, s, master, observed, indications, of, his, mathematical, genius, he, advised, the, father, to, educate, his, son, not, for, his, own, business, as, he, had, intended, but, at, the, university, of, cambridge, at, the, age, of, 17, cayley, began, residence, at, trinity, college, cambridge, where, he, excelled, in, greek, french, german, and, italian, as, well, as, mathematics, the, cause, of, the, analytical, society, had, now, triumphed, and, the, cambridge, mathematical, journal, had, been, instituted, by, gregory, and, robert, leslie, ellis, to, this, journal, at, the, age, of, twenty, cayley, contributed, three, papers, on, subjects, that, had, been, suggested, by, reading, the, m, canique, analytique, of, joseph, louis, lagrange, and, some, of, the, works, of, laplace, cayley, s, tutor, at, cambridge, was, george, peacock, and, his, private, coach, was, william, hopkins, he, finished, his, undergraduate, course, by, winning, the, place, of, senior, wrangler, and, the, first, smith, s, prize, his, next, step, was, to, take, the, m, a, degree, and, win, a, fellowship, by, competitive, examination, he, continued, to, reside, at, cambridge, university, for, four, years, during, which, time, he, took, some, pupils, but, his, main, work, was, the, preparation, of, 28, memoirs, to, the, mathematical, journal, because, of, the, limited, tenure, of, his, fellowship, it, was, necessary, to, choose, a, profession, like, de, morgan, cayley, chose, law, and, was, admitted, to, lincoln, s, inn, london, on, 20, april, 1846, at, the, age, of, 24, he, made, a, specialty, of, conveyancing, it, was, while, he, was, a, pupil, at, the, bar, examination, that, he, went, to, dublin, to, hear, william, rowan, hamilton, s, lectures, on, quaternions, his, friend, j, j, sylvester, his, senior, by, five, years, at, cambridge, was, then, an, actuary, resident, in, london, they, used, to, walk, together, round, the, courts, of, lincoln, s, inn, discussing, the, theory, of, invariants, and, covariants, during, these, fourteen, years, cayley, produced, between, two, and, three, hundred, papers, around, 1860, cambridge, university, s, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, newton, s, chair, was, supplemented, by, the, new, sadleirian, professorship, using, funds, bequeathed, by, lady, sadleir, with, the, 42, year, old, cayley, as, its, first, holder, his, duties, were, to, explain, and, teach, the, principles, of, pure, mathematics, and, to, apply, himself, to, the, advancement, of, that, science, he, gave, up, a, lucrative, legal, practice, for, a, modest, salary, but, never, regretted, the, exchange, since, it, allowed, him, to, devote, his, energies, to, the, pursuit, that, he, liked, best, he, at, once, married, and, settled, down, in, cambridge, and, unlike, hamilton, enjoyed, a, home, life, of, great, happiness, sylvester, his, friend, from, his, bachelor, days, once, expressed, his, envy, of, cayley, s, peaceful, family, life, whereas, the, unmarried, sylvester, had, to, fight, the, world, all, his, days, at, first, the, sadleirian, professor, was, paid, to, lecture, over, one, of, the, terms, of, the, academic, year, but, the, university, financial, reform, of, 1886, freed, funds, to, extend, his, lectures, to, two, terms, for, many, years, his, courses, were, attended, only, by, a, few, students, who, had, finished, their, examination, preparation, but, after, the, reform, the, attendance, numbered, about, fifteen, he, generally, lectured, on, his, current, research, topic, as, for, his, duty, to, the, advancement, of, mathematical, science, he, published, a, long, and, fruitful, series, of, memoirs, ranging, over, all, of, pure, mathematics, he, also, became, the, standing, referee, on, the, merits, of, mathematical, papers, to, many, societies, both, at, home, and, abroad, in, 1872, he, was, made, an, honorary, fellow, of, trinity, college, and, three, years, later, an, ordinary, fellow, a, paid, position, about, this, time, his, friends, subscribed, for, a, presentation, portrait, maxwell, wrote, an, address, praising, cayley, s, principal, works, including, his, chapters, on, the, analytical, geometry, of, n, displaystyle, n, dimensions, on, the, theory, of, determinants, memoir, on, the, theory, of, matrices, memoirs, on, skew, surfaces, otherwise, scrolls, and, on, the, delineation, of, a, cubic, scroll, in, addition, to, his, work, on, algebra, cayley, made, fundamental, contributions, to, algebraic, geometry, cayley, and, salmon, discovered, the, 27, lines, on, a, cubic, surface, cayley, constructed, the, chow, variety, of, all, curves, in, projective, 3, space, he, founded, the, algebro, geometric, theory, of, ruled, surfaces, his, contributions, to, combinatorics, include, counting, the, n, n, 2, trees, on, n, labeled, vertices, by, the, pioneering, use, of, generating, functions, in, 1876, he, published, a, treatise, on, elliptic, functions, he, took, great, interest, in, the, movement, for, the, university, education, of, women, at, cambridge, the, first, women, s, colleges, were, girton, and, newnham, in, the, early, days, of, girton, college, he, gave, direct, help, in, teaching, and, for, some, years, he, was, chairman, of, the, council, of, newnham, college, in, the, progress, of, which, he, took, the, keenest, interest, to, the, last, in, 1881, he, received, from, the, johns, hopkins, university, baltimore, where, sylvester, was, then, professor, of, mathematics, an, invitation, to, deliver, a, course, of, lectures, he, accepted, the, invitation, and, lectured, at, baltimore, during, the, first, five, months, of, 1882, on, the, subject, of, the, abelian, and, theta, functions, in, 1893, cayley, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1883, cayley, was, president, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, the, meeting, was, held, at, southport, in, the, north, of, england, as, the, president, s, address, is, one, of, the, great, popular, events, of, the, meeting, and, brings, out, an, audience, of, general, culture, it, is, usually, made, as, little, technical, as, possible, cayley, 1996, took, for, his, subject, the, progress, of, pure, mathematics, in, 1889, the, cambridge, university, press, began, the, publication, of, his, collected, papers, which, he, appreciated, very, much, he, edited, seven, of, the, quarto, volumes, himself, though, suffering, from, a, painful, internal, malady, he, died, 26, january, 1895, at, age, 74, his, funeral, at, trinity, chapel, was, attended, by, the, leading, scientists, of, britain, with, official, representatives, from, as, far, as, russia, and, america, the, remainder, of, his, papers, were, edited, by, andrew, forsyth, his, successor, as, sadleirian, professor, in, total, thirteen, quarto, volumes, and, 967, papers, his, work, continues, in, frequent, use, cited, in, more, than, 200, mathematical, papers, in, the, 21st, century, alone, cayley, retained, to, the, last, his, fondness, for, novel, reading, and, for, travelling, he, also, took, special, pleasure, in, paintings, and, architecture, and, he, practiced, water, colour, painting, which, he, found, useful, sometimes, in, making, mathematical, diagrams, cayley, is, buried, in, the, mill, road, cemetery, cambridge, an, 1874, portrait, of, cayley, by, lowes, cato, dickinson, and, an, 1884, portrait, by, william, longmaid, are, in, the, collection, of, trinity, college, cambridge, a, number, of, mathematical, terms, are, named, after, him, this, article, incorporates, text, from, the, 1916, lectures, on, ten, british, mathematicians, of, the, nineteenth, century, by, alexander, macfarlane, which, is, in, the, public, domain
