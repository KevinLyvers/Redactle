believed, it, a, significant, step, up, from, his, previous, two, novels, however, when, submitted, for, publication, to, boni, liveright, it, was, rejected, faulkner, was, devastated, by, this, rejection, but, he, eventually, allowed, his, literary, agent, ben, wasson, to, edit, the, text, and, the, novel, was, published, in, 1929, as, sartoris, the, work, was, notable, in, that, it, was, his, first, novel, that, dealt, with, the, civil, war, rather, than, the, contemporary, emphasis, on, world, war, i, and, its, legacy, in, autumn, 1928, just, after, his, 31st, birthday, faulkner, began, working, on, the, sound, and, the, fury, he, started, by, writing, three, short, stories, about, a, group, of, children, with, the, last, name, compson, but, soon, began, to, feel, that, the, characters, he, had, created, might, be, better, suited, for, a, full, length, novel, perhaps, as, a, result, of, disappointment, in, the, initial, rejection, of, flags, in, the, dust, faulkner, had, now, become, indifferent, to, his, publishers, and, wrote, this, novel, in, a, much, more, experimental, style, in, describing, the, writing, process, for, this, work, faulkner, later, said, one, day, i, seemed, to, shut, the, door, between, me, and, all, publisher, s, addresses, and, book, lists, i, said, to, myself, now, i, can, write, after, its, completion, faulkner, insisted, that, wasson,

for, the, award, despite, a, fable, being, a, lesser, work, of, his, and, the, board, overrode, the, jury, s, selection, much, to, the, disgust, of, its, members, by, the, time, of, the, portable, faulkner, s, publication, most, of, his, novels, had, been, out, of, print, faulkner, was, awarded, the, 1949, nobel, prize, in, literature, for, his, powerful, and, artistically, unique,

acceptance, speech, on, the, immortality, of, the, artists, although, brief, contained, a, number, of, allusions, and, references, to, other, literary, works, however, faulkner, detested, the, fame, and, glory, that, resulted, from, his, recognition, his, aversion, was, so, great, that, his, 17, year, old, daughter, learned, of, the, nobel, prize, only, when, she, was, called, to, the, principal, s, office, during, the, school, day, he, began, by, saying, i, feel, that, this, award, was, not, made, to, me, as, a, man, but, to, my, work, a, life, s, work, in, the, agony, and, sweat, of, the, human, spirit, not, for, glory, and, least, of, all, for, profit, but, to, create, out, of, the, materials, of, the, human, spirit, something, which, did, not, exist, before, so, this, award, is, only, mine, in, trust, it, will, not, be, difficult, to, find, a, dedication, for, the, money, part, of, it, commensurate, with, the, purpose, and, significance, of, its, origin, he, donated, part, of, his, nobel, money, to, establish, a, fund, to, support, and, encourage, new, fiction, writers, eventually, resulting, in, the, william, faulkner, foundation, 1960, 1970, in, 1951, faulkner,

critics, regarded, his, work, as, raw, slabs, of, pseudorealism, that, had, relatively, little, merit, as, serious, writing, his, style, has, been, described, as, impenetrably, convoluted, in, an, interview, with, the, paris, review, in, 1956, faulkner, remarked, let, the, writer, take, up, surgery, or, bricklaying, if, he, is, interested, in, technique, there, is, no, mechanical, way, to, get, the, writing, done, no, shortcut, the, young, writer, would, be, a, fool, to, follow, a, theory, teach, yourself, by, your, own, mistakes, people, learn, only, by, error, the, good, artist, believes, that, nobody, is, good, enough, to, give, him, advice, he, has, supreme, vanity, no, matter, how, much, he, admires, the, old, writer, he, wants, to, beat, him, in, that, same, interview, jean, stein,
