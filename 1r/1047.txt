pericles, p, r, k, l, i, z, greek, c, 495, 429, bc, was, a, greek, politician, and, general, during, the, golden, age, of, athens, he, was, prominent, and, influential, in, ancient, athenian, politics, particularly, between, the, greco, persian, wars, and, the, peloponnesian, war, and, was, acclaimed, by, thucydides, a, contemporary, historian, as, the, first, citizen, of, athens, pericles, turned, the, delian, league, into, an, athenian, empire, and, led, his, countrymen, during, the, first, two, years, of, the, peloponnesian, war, the, period, during, which, he, led, athens, as, archon, ruler, roughly, from, 461, to, 429, bc, is, sometimes, known, as, the, age, of, pericles, but, the, period, thus, denoted, can, include, times, as, early, as, the, persian, wars, or, as, late, as, the, following, century, pericles, promoted, the, arts, and, literature, and, it, was, principally, through, his, efforts, that, athens, acquired, the, reputation, of, being, the, educational, and, cultural, center, of, the, ancient, greek, world, he, started, an, ambitious, project, that, generated, most, of, the, surviving, structures, on, the, acropolis, including, the, parthenon, this, project, beautified, and, protected, the, city, exhibited, its, glory, and, gave, work, to, its, people, pericles, also, fostered, athenian, democracy, to, such, an, extent, that, critics, called, him, a, populist, pericles, was, descended, through, his, mother, from, the, powerful, and, historically, influential, alcmaeonid, family, he, along, with, several, members, of, his, family, succumbed, to, the, plague, of, athens, in, 429, bc, which, weakened, the, city, state, during, a, protracted, conflict, with, sparta, pericles, was, born, c, 495, bc, in, athens, greece, he, was, the, son, of, the, politician, xanthippus, who, though, ostracized, in, 485, 484, bc, returned, to, athens, to, command, the, athenian, contingent, in, the, greek, victory, at, mycale, just, five, years, later, pericles, mother, agariste, was, a, member, of, the, powerful, and, controversial, noble, family, of, the, alcmaeonidae, and, her, familial, connections, played, a, crucial, role, in, helping, start, his, political, career, agariste, was, the, great, granddaughter, of, the, tyrant, of, sicyon, cleisthenes, and, the, niece, of, the, athenian, reformer, cleisthenes, pericles, belonged, to, the, attic, phyle, clan, of, acamantis, his, early, years, were, quiet, the, introverted, young, pericles, avoided, public, appearances, instead, preferring, to, devote, his, time, to, his, studies, according, to, herodotus, and, plutarch, agariste, dreamed, a, few, nights, before, pericles, birth, that, she, had, borne, a, lion, legends, say, that, philip, ii, of, macedon, had, a, similar, dream, before, the, birth, of, his, son, alexander, the, great, one, interpretation, of, the, dream, treats, the, lion, as, a, traditional, symbol, of, greatness, but, the, story, may, also, allude, to, the, unusually, large, size, of, pericles, skull, which, became, a, popular, target, of, contemporary, comedians, who, called, him, squill, head, after, the, squill, or, sea, onion, although, plutarch, claims, that, this, deformity, was, the, reason, that, pericles, was, always, depicted, wearing, a, helmet, this, is, not, the, case, the, helmet, was, actually, the, symbol, of, his, official, rank, as, strategos, general, our, policy, does, not, copy, the, laws, of, neighboring, states, we, are, rather, a, pattern, to, others, than, imitators, ourselves, it, is, called, a, democracy, because, not, the, few, but, the, many, govern, if, we, look, to, the, laws, they, afford, equal, justice, to, all, in, their, private, differences, if, to, social, standing, advancement, in, public, life, falls, to, reputation, for, capacity, class, considerations, not, being, allowed, to, interfere, with, merit, nor, again, does, poverty, bar, the, way, if, a, man, is, able, to, serve, the, state, he, is, not, hindered, by, the, obscurity, of, his, condition, his, family, s, nobility, and, wealth, allowed, him, to, fully, pursue, his, inclination, toward, education, he, learned, music, from, the, masters, of, the, time, damon, or, pythocleides, could, have, been, his, teacher, and, he, is, considered, to, have, been, the, first, politician, to, attribute, importance, to, philosophy, he, enjoyed, the, company, of, the, philosophers, protagoras, zeno, of, elea, and, anaxagoras, anaxagoras, in, particular, became, a, close, friend, and, influenced, him, greatly, pericles, manner, of, thought, and, rhetorical, charisma, may, have, possibly, been, in, part, products, of, anaxagoras, emphasis, on, emotional, calm, in, the, face, of, trouble, and, skepticism, about, divine, phenomena, his, proverbial, calmness, and, self, control, are, also, often, regarded, as, products, of, anaxagoras, influence, in, the, spring, of, 472, bc, pericles, presented, the, persians, of, aeschylus, at, the, greater, dionysia, as, a, liturgy, demonstrating, that, he, was, one, of, the, wealthier, men, of, athens, simon, hornblower, has, argued, that, pericles, selection, of, this, play, which, presents, a, nostalgic, picture, of, themistocles, famous, victory, at, salamis, shows, that, the, young, politician, was, supporting, themistocles, against, his, political, opponent, cimon, whose, faction, succeeded, in, having, themistocles, ostracized, shortly, afterward, plutarch, says, that, pericles, stood, first, among, the, athenians, for, forty, years, if, this, was, so, pericles, must, have, taken, up, a, position, of, leadership, by, the, early, 460s, bc, in, his, early, or, mid, thirties, throughout, these, years, he, endeavored, to, protect, his, privacy, and, to, present, himself, as, a, model, for, his, fellow, citizens, for, example, he, would, often, avoid, banquets, trying, to, be, frugal, in, 463, bc, pericles, was, the, leading, prosecutor, of, cimon, the, leader, of, the, conservative, faction, who, was, accused, of, neglecting, athens, vital, interests, in, macedon, although, cimon, was, acquitted, this, confrontation, proved, that, pericles, major, political, opponent, was, vulnerable, around, 461, bc, the, leadership, of, the, democratic, party, decided, it, was, time, to, take, aim, at, the, areopagus, a, traditional, council, controlled, by, the, athenian, aristocracy, which, had, once, been, the, most, powerful, body, in, the, state, the, leader, of, the, party, and, mentor, of, pericles, ephialtes, proposed, a, reduction, of, the, areopagus, powers, the, ecclesia, the, athenian, assembly, adopted, ephialtes, proposal, without, opposition, this, reform, signaled, the, beginning, of, a, new, era, of, radical, democracy, the, democratic, party, gradually, became, dominant, in, athenian, politics, and, pericles, seemed, willing, to, follow, a, populist, policy, to, cajole, the, public, according, to, aristotle, pericles, stance, can, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, his, principal, political, opponent, cimon, was, both, rich, and, generous, and, was, able, to, gain, public, favor, by, lavishly, handing, out, portions, of, his, sizable, personal, fortune, the, historian, loren, j, samons, ii, argues, however, that, pericles, had, enough, resources, to, make, a, political, mark, by, private, means, had, he, so, chosen, in, 461, bc, pericles, achieved, the, political, elimination, of, this, opponent, using, ostracism, the, accusation, was, that, cimon, betrayed, his, city, by, aiding, sparta, after, cimon, s, ostracism, pericles, continued, to, promote, a, populist, social, policy, he, first, proposed, a, decree, that, permitted, the, poor, to, watch, theatrical, plays, without, paying, with, the, state, covering, the, cost, of, their, admission, with, other, decrees, he, lowered, the, property, requirement, for, the, archonship, in, 458, 457, bc, and, bestowed, generous, wages, on, all, citizens, who, served, as, jurymen, in, the, heliaia, the, supreme, court, of, athens, some, time, just, after, 454, bc, his, most, controversial, measure, however, was, a, law, of, 451, bc, limiting, athenian, citizenship, to, those, of, athenian, parentage, on, both, sides, rather, the, admiration, of, the, present, and, succeeding, ages, will, be, ours, since, we, have, not, left, our, power, without, witness, but, have, shown, it, by, mighty, proofs, and, far, from, needing, a, homer, for, our, panegyrist, or, other, of, his, craft, whose, verses, might, charm, for, the, moment, only, for, the, impression, which, they, gave, to, melt, at, the, touch, of, fact, we, have, forced, every, sea, and, land, to, be, the, highway, of, our, daring, and, everywhere, whether, for, evil, or, for, good, have, left, imperishable, monuments, behind, us, such, measures, impelled, pericles, critics, to, hold, him, responsible, for, the, gradual, degeneration, of, the, athenian, democracy, constantine, paparrigopoulos, a, major, modern, greek, historian, argues, that, pericles, sought, for, the, expansion, and, stabilization, of, all, democratic, institutions, accordingly, he, enacted, legislation, granting, the, lower, classes, access, to, the, political, system, and, the, public, offices, from, which, they, had, previously, been, barred, according, to, samons, pericles, believed, that, it, was, necessary, to, raise, the, demos, in, which, he, saw, an, untapped, source, of, athenian, power, and, the, crucial, element, of, athenian, military, dominance, the, fleet, backbone, of, athenian, power, since, the, days, of, themistocles, was, manned, almost, entirely, by, members, of, the, lower, classes, cimon, in, contrast, apparently, believed, that, no, further, free, space, for, democratic, evolution, existed, he, was, certain, that, democracy, had, reached, its, peak, and, pericles, reforms, were, leading, to, the, stalemate, of, populism, according, to, paparrigopoulos, history, vindicated, cimon, because, athens, after, pericles, death, sank, into, the, abyss, of, political, turmoil, and, demagogy, paparrigopoulos, maintains, that, an, unprecedented, regression, descended, upon, the, city, whose, glory, perished, as, a, result, of, pericles, populist, policies, according, to, another, historian, justin, daniel, king, radical, democracy, benefited, people, individually, but, harmed, the, state, in, contrast, donald, kagan, asserts, that, the, democratic, measures, pericles, put, into, effect, provided, the, basis, for, an, unassailable, political, strength, after, all, cimon, finally, accepted, the, new, democracy, and, did, not, oppose, the, citizenship, law, after, he, returned, from, exile, in, 451, bc, ephialtes, murder, in, 461, bc, paved, the, way, for, pericles, to, consolidate, his, authority, without, opposition, after, the, expulsion, of, cimon, the, unchallengeable, leader, of, the, democratic, party, became, the, unchallengeable, ruler, of, athens, he, remained, in, power, until, his, death, in, 429, bc, pericles, made, his, first, military, excursions, during, the, first, peloponnesian, war, which, was, caused, in, part, by, athens, alliance, with, megara, and, argos, and, the, subsequent, reaction, of, sparta, in, 454, bc, he, attacked, sicyon, and, acarnania, he, then, unsuccessfully, tried, to, conquer, oeniadea, on, the, corinthian, gulf, before, returning, to, athens, in, 451, bc, cimon, returned, from, exile, and, negotiated, a, five, years, truce, with, sparta, after, a, proposal, of, pericles, an, event, which, indicates, a, shift, in, pericles, political, strategy, pericles, may, have, realized, the, importance, of, cimon, s, contribution, during, the, ongoing, conflicts, against, the, peloponnesians, and, the, persians, anthony, j, podlecki, argues, however, that, pericles, alleged, change, of, position, was, invented, by, ancient, writers, to, support, a, tendentious, view, of, pericles, shiftiness, plutarch, states, that, cimon, struck, a, power, sharing, deal, with, his, opponents, according, to, which, pericles, would, carry, through, the, interior, affairs, and, cimon, would, be, the, leader, of, the, athenian, army, campaigning, abroad, if, it, were, actually, made, this, bargain, would, constitute, a, concession, on, pericles, part, that, he, was, not, a, great, strategist, kagan, s, view, is, that, cimon, adapted, himself, to, the, new, conditions, and, promoted, a, political, marriage, between, periclean, liberals, and, cimonian, conservatives, in, the, mid, 450s, the, athenians, launched, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, aid, an, egyptian, revolt, against, persia, which, led, to, a, prolonged, siege, of, a, persian, fortress, in, the, nile, delta, the, campaign, culminated, in, disaster, the, besieging, force, was, defeated, and, destroyed, in, 451, 450, bc, the, athenians, sent, troops, to, cyprus, cimon, defeated, the, persians, in, the, battle, of, salamis, in, cyprus, but, died, of, disease, in, 449, bc, pericles, is, said, to, have, initiated, both, expeditions, in, egypt, and, cyprus, although, some, researchers, such, as, karl, julius, beloch, argue, that, the, dispatch, of, such, a, great, fleet, conforms, with, the, spirit, of, cimon, s, policy, complicating, the, account, of, this, period, is, the, issue, of, the, peace, of, callias, which, allegedly, ended, hostilities, between, the, greeks, and, the, persians, the, very, existence, of, the, treaty, is, hotly, disputed, and, its, particulars, and, negotiation, are, ambiguous, ernst, badian, believes, that, a, peace, between, athens, and, persia, was, first, ratified, in, 463, bc, making, the, athenian, interventions, in, egypt, and, cyprus, violations, of, the, peace, and, renegotiated, at, the, conclusion, of, the, campaign, in, cyprus, taking, force, again, by, 449, 448, bc, john, fine, in, contrast, suggests, that, the, first, peace, between, athens, and, persia, was, concluded, in, 450, 449, bc, due, to, pericles, calculation, that, ongoing, conflict, with, persia, was, undermining, athens, ability, to, spread, its, influence, in, greece, and, the, aegean, kagan, believes, that, pericles, used, callias, a, brother, in, law, of, cimon, as, a, symbol, of, unity, and, employed, him, several, times, to, negotiate, important, agreements, in, the, spring, of, 449, bc, pericles, proposed, the, congress, decree, which, led, to, a, meeting, congress, of, all, greek, states, to, consider, the, question, of, rebuilding, the, temples, destroyed, by, the, persians, the, congress, failed, because, of, sparta, s, stance, but, pericles, intentions, remain, unclear, some, historians, think, that, he, wanted, to, prompt, a, confederation, with, the, participation, of, all, the, greek, cities, others, think, he, wanted, to, assert, athenian, pre, eminence, according, to, the, historian, terry, buckley, the, objective, of, the, congress, decree, was, a, new, mandate, for, the, delian, league, and, for, the, collection, of, phoros, taxes, remember, too, that, if, your, country, has, the, greatest, name, in, all, the, world, it, is, because, she, never, bent, before, disaster, because, she, has, expended, more, life, and, effort, in, war, than, any, other, city, and, has, won, for, herself, a, power, greater, than, any, hitherto, known, the, memory, of, which, will, descend, to, the, latest, posterity, during, the, second, sacred, war, pericles, led, the, athenian, army, against, delphi, and, reinstated, phocis, in, its, sovereign, rights, on, the, oracle, in, 447, bc, pericles, engaged, in, his, most, admired, excursion, the, expulsion, of, barbarians, from, the, thracian, peninsula, of, gallipoli, to, establish, athenian, colonists, in, the, region, at, this, time, however, athens, was, seriously, challenged, by, a, number, of, revolts, among, its, subjects, in, 447, bc, the, oligarchs, of, thebes, conspired, against, the, democratic, faction, the, athenians, demanded, their, immediate, surrender, but, after, the, battle, of, coronea, pericles, was, forced, to, concede, the, loss, of, boeotia, to, recover, the, prisoners, taken, in, that, battle, with, boeotia, in, hostile, hands, phocis, and, locris, became, untenable, and, quickly, fell, under, the, control, of, hostile, oligarchs, in, 446, bc, a, more, dangerous, uprising, erupted, euboea, and, megara, revolted, pericles, crossed, over, to, euboea, with, his, troops, but, was, forced, to, return, when, the, spartan, army, invaded, attica, through, bribery, and, negotiations, pericles, defused, the, imminent, threat, and, the, spartans, returned, home, when, pericles, was, later, audited, for, the, handling, of, public, money, an, expenditure, of, 10, talents, was, not, sufficiently, justified, since, the, official, documents, just, referred, that, the, money, was, spent, for, a, very, serious, purpose, nonetheless, the, serious, purpose, namely, the, bribery, was, so, obvious, to, the, auditors, that, they, approved, the, expenditure, without, official, meddling, and, without, even, investigating, the, mystery, after, the, spartan, threat, had, been, removed, pericles, crossed, back, to, euboea, to, crush, the, revolt, there, he, then, punished, the, landowners, of, chalcis, who, lost, their, properties, the, residents, of, histiaea, meanwhile, who, had, butchered, the, crew, of, an, athenian, trireme, were, uprooted, and, replaced, by, 2, 000, athenian, settlers, the, crisis, was, brought, to, an, official, end, by, the, thirty, years, peace, winter, of, 446, 445, bc, in, which, athens, relinquished, most, of, the, possessions, and, interests, on, the, greek, mainland, which, it, had, acquired, since, 460, bc, and, both, athens, and, sparta, agreed, not, to, attempt, to, win, over, the, other, state, s, allies, in, 444, bc, the, conservative, and, the, democratic, factions, confronted, each, other, in, a, fierce, struggle, the, ambitious, new, leader, of, the, conservatives, thucydides, not, to, be, confused, with, the, historian, of, the, same, name, accused, pericles, of, profligacy, criticizing, the, way, he, spent, the, money, for, the, ongoing, building, plan, thucydides, initially, managed, to, incite, the, passions, of, the, ecclesia, regarding, these, charges, in, his, favor, however, when, pericles, took, the, floor, his, resolute, arguments, put, thucydides, and, the, conservatives, firmly, on, the, defensive, finally, pericles, proposed, to, reimburse, the, city, for, all, questionable, expenses, from, his, private, property, with, the, proviso, that, he, would, make, the, inscriptions, of, dedication, in, his, own, name, his, stance, was, greeted, with, applause, and, thucydides, was, soundly, if, unexpectedly, defeated, in, 442, bc, the, athenian, public, voted, to, ostracize, thucydides, from, the, city, for, 10, years, and, pericles, was, once, again, the, unchallenged, ruler, of, the, athenian, political, arena, pericles, wanted, to, stabilize, athens, dominance, over, its, alliance, and, to, enforce, its, pre, eminence, in, greece, the, process, by, which, the, delian, league, transformed, into, an, athenian, empire, is, generally, considered, to, have, begun, well, before, pericles, time, as, various, allies, in, the, league, chose, to, pay, tribute, to, athens, instead, of, manning, ships, for, the, league, s, fleet, but, the, transformation, was, speeded, and, brought, to, its, conclusion, by, pericles, the, final, steps, in, the, shift, to, empire, may, have, been, triggered, by, athens, defeat, in, egypt, which, challenged, the, city, s, dominance, in, the, aegean, and, led, to, the, revolt, of, several, allies, such, as, miletus, and, erythrae, either, because, of, a, genuine, fear, for, its, safety, after, the, defeat, in, egypt, and, the, revolts, of, the, allies, or, as, a, pretext, to, gain, control, of, the, league, s, finances, athens, transferred, the, treasury, of, the, alliance, from, delos, to, athens, in, 454, 453, bc, by, 450, 449, bc, the, revolts, in, miletus, and, erythrae, were, quelled, and, athens, restored, its, rule, over, its, allies, around, 447, bc, clearchus, proposed, the, coinage, decree, which, imposed, athenian, silver, coinage, weights, and, measures, on, all, of, the, allies, according, to, one, of, the, decree, s, most, stringent, provisions, surplus, from, a, minting, operation, was, to, go, into, a, special, fund, and, anyone, proposing, to, use, it, otherwise, was, subject, to, the, death, penalty, it, was, from, the, alliance, s, treasury, that, pericles, drew, the, funds, necessary, to, enable, his, ambitious, building, plan, centered, on, the, periclean, acropolis, which, included, the, propylaea, the, parthenon, and, the, golden, statue, of, athena, sculpted, by, pericles, friend, phidias, in, 449, bc, pericles, proposed, a, decree, allowing, the, use, of, 9, 000, talents, to, finance, the, major, rebuilding, program, of, athenian, temples, angelos, vlachos, a, greek, academician, points, out, the, use, of, the, alliance, s, treasury, initiated, and, executed, by, pericles, as, one, of, the, largest, embezzlements, in, human, history, this, misappropriation, financed, however, some, of, the, most, marvellous, artistic, creations, of, the, ancient, world, the, samian, war, was, one, of, the, last, significant, military, events, before, the, peloponnesian, war, after, thucydides, ostracism, pericles, was, re, elected, yearly, to, the, generalship, the, only, office, he, ever, officially, occupied, although, his, influence, was, so, great, as, to, make, him, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, state, in, 440, bc, samos, went, to, war, against, miletus, over, control, of, priene, an, ancient, city, of, ionia, on, the, foot, hills, of, mycale, worsted, in, the, war, the, milesians, came, to, athens, to, plead, their, case, against, the, samians, when, the, athenians, ordered, the, two, sides, to, stop, fighting, and, submit, the, case, to, arbitration, in, athens, the, samians, refused, in, response, pericles, passed, a, decree, dispatching, an, expedition, to, samos, alleging, against, its, people, that, although, they, were, ordered, to, break, off, their, war, against, the, milesians, they, were, not, complying, in, a, naval, battle, the, athenians, led, by, pericles, and, nine, other, generals, defeated, the, forces, of, samos, and, imposed, on, the, island, an, athenian, administration, when, the, samians, revolted, against, athenian, rule, pericles, compelled, the, rebels, to, capitulate, after, a, tough, siege, of, eight, months, which, resulted, in, substantial, discontent, among, the, athenian, sailors, pericles, then, quelled, a, revolt, in, byzantium, and, when, he, returned, to, athens, gave, a, funeral, oration, to, honor, the, soldiers, who, died, in, the, expedition, between, 438, and, 436, bc, pericles, led, athens, fleet, in, pontus, and, established, friendly, relations, with, the, greek, cities, of, the, region, pericles, focused, also, on, internal, projects, such, as, the, fortification, of, athens, the, building, of, the, middle, wall, about, 440, bc, and, on, the, creation, of, new, cleruchies, such, as, andros, naxos, and, thurii, 444, bc, as, well, as, amphipolis, 437, 436, bc, pericles, and, his, friends, were, never, immune, from, attack, as, preeminence, in, democratic, athens, was, not, equivalent, to, absolute, rule, just, before, the, eruption, of, the, peloponnesian, war, pericles, and, two, of, his, closest, associates, phidias, and, his, companion, aspasia, faced, a, series, of, personal, and, judicial, attacks, phidias, who, had, been, in, charge, of, all, building, projects, was, first, accused, of, embezzling, gold, meant, for, the, statue, of, athena, and, then, of, impiety, because, when, he, wrought, the, battle, of, the, amazons, on, the, shield, of, athena, he, carved, out, a, figure, that, suggested, himself, as, a, bald, old, man, and, also, inserted, a, very, fine, likeness, of, pericles, fighting, with, an, amazon, aspasia, who, was, noted, for, her, ability, as, a, conversationalist, and, adviser, was, accused, of, corrupting, the, women, of, athens, to, satisfy, pericles, perversions, the, accusations, against, her, were, probably, nothing, more, than, unproven, slanders, but, the, whole, experience, was, very, bitter, for, pericles, although, aspasia, was, acquitted, thanks, to, a, rare, emotional, outburst, of, pericles, his, friend, phidias, died, in, prison, according, to, plutarch, however, he, is, also, credited, with, the, later, statue, of, zeus, at, olympia, therefore, this, is, debated, and, another, friend, of, his, anaxagoras, was, attacked, by, the, ecclesia, for, his, religious, beliefs, beyond, these, initial, prosecutions, the, ecclesia, attacked, pericles, himself, by, asking, him, to, justify, his, ostensible, profligacy, with, and, maladministration, of, public, money, according, to, plutarch, pericles, was, so, afraid, of, the, oncoming, trial, that, he, did, not, let, the, athenians, yield, to, the, lacedaemonians, beloch, also, believes, that, pericles, deliberately, brought, on, the, war, to, protect, his, political, position, at, home, thus, at, the, start, of, the, peloponnesian, war, athens, found, itself, in, the, awkward, position, of, entrusting, its, future, to, a, leader, whose, pre, eminence, had, just, been, seriously, shaken, for, the, first, time, in, over, a, decade, the, causes, of, the, peloponnesian, war, have, been, much, debated, but, many, ancient, historians, lay, the, blame, on, pericles, and, athens, plutarch, seems, to, believe, that, pericles, and, the, athenians, incited, the, war, scrambling, to, implement, their, belligerent, tactics, with, a, sort, of, arrogance, and, a, love, of, strife, thucydides, hints, at, the, same, thing, believing, the, reason, for, the, war, was, sparta, s, fear, of, athenian, power, and, growth, however, as, he, is, generally, regarded, as, an, admirer, of, pericles, thucydides, has, been, criticized, for, bias, against, sparta, pericles, was, convinced, that, the, war, against, sparta, which, could, not, conceal, its, envy, of, athens, pre, eminence, was, inevitable, if, unfortunate, therefore, he, did, not, hesitate, to, send, troops, to, corcyra, to, reinforce, the, corcyraean, fleet, which, was, fighting, against, corinth, in, 433, bc, the, enemy, fleets, confronted, each, other, at, the, battle, of, sybota, and, a, year, later, the, athenians, fought, corinthian, colonists, at, the, battle, of, potidaea, these, two, events, contributed, greatly, to, corinth, s, lasting, hatred, of, athens, during, the, same, period, pericles, proposed, the, megarian, decree, which, resembled, a, modern, trade, embargo, according, to, the, provisions, of, the, decree, megarian, merchants, were, excluded, from, the, market, of, athens, and, the, ports, in, its, empire, this, ban, strangled, the, megarian, economy, and, strained, the, fragile, peace, between, athens, and, sparta, which, was, allied, with, megara, according, to, george, cawkwell, a, praelector, in, ancient, history, with, this, decree, pericles, breached, the, thirty, years, peace, but, perhaps, not, without, the, semblance, of, an, excuse, the, athenians, justification, was, that, the, megarians, had, cultivated, the, sacred, land, consecrated, to, demeter, and, had, given, refuge, to, runaway, slaves, a, behavior, which, the, athenians, considered, to, be, impious, after, consultations, with, its, allies, sparta, sent, a, deputation, to, athens, demanding, certain, concessions, such, as, the, immediate, expulsion, of, the, alcmaeonidae, family, including, pericles, and, the, retraction, of, the, megarian, decree, threatening, war, if, the, demands, were, not, met, the, obvious, purpose, of, these, proposals, was, the, instigation, of, a, confrontation, between, pericles, and, the, people, this, event, indeed, would, come, about, a, few, years, later, at, that, time, the, athenians, unhesitatingly, followed, pericles, instructions, in, the, first, legendary, oration, thucydides, puts, in, his, mouth, pericles, advised, the, athenians, not, to, yield, to, their, opponents, demands, since, they, were, militarily, stronger, pericles, was, not, prepared, to, make, unilateral, concessions, believing, that, if, athens, conceded, on, that, issue, then, sparta, was, sure, to, come, up, with, further, demands, consequently, pericles, asked, the, spartans, to, offer, a, quid, pro, quo, in, exchange, for, retracting, the, megarian, decree, the, athenians, demanded, from, sparta, to, abandon, their, practice, of, periodic, expulsion, of, foreigners, from, their, territory, xenelasia, and, to, recognize, the, autonomy, of, its, allied, cities, a, request, implying, that, sparta, s, hegemony, was, also, ruthless, the, terms, were, rejected, by, the, spartans, and, with, neither, side, willing, to, back, down, the, two, cities, prepared, for, war, according, to, athanasios, g, platias, and, constantinos, koliopoulos, professors, of, strategic, studies, and, international, politics, rather, than, to, submit, to, coercive, demands, pericles, chose, war, another, consideration, that, may, well, have, influenced, pericles, stance, was, the, concern, that, revolts, in, the, empire, might, spread, if, athens, showed, itself, weak, in, 431, bc, while, peace, already, was, precarious, archidamus, ii, sparta, s, king, sent, a, new, delegation, to, athens, demanding, that, the, athenians, submit, to, sparta, s, demands, this, deputation, was, not, allowed, to, enter, athens, as, pericles, had, already, passed, a, resolution, according, to, which, no, spartan, deputation, would, be, welcomed, if, the, spartans, had, previously, initiated, any, hostile, military, actions, the, spartan, army, was, at, this, time, gathered, at, corinth, and, citing, this, as, a, hostile, action, the, athenians, refused, to, admit, their, emissaries, with, his, last, attempt, at, negotiation, thus, declined, archidamus, invaded, attica, but, found, no, athenians, there, pericles, aware, that, sparta, s, strategy, would, be, to, invade, and, ravage, athenian, territory, had, previously, arranged, to, evacuate, the, entire, population, of, the, region, to, within, the, walls, of, athens, no, definite, record, exists, of, how, exactly, pericles, managed, to, convince, the, residents, of, attica, to, agree, to, move, into, the, crowded, urban, areas, for, most, the, move, meant, abandoning, their, land, and, ancestral, shrines, and, completely, changing, their, lifestyle, therefore, although, they, agreed, to, leave, many, rural, residents, were, far, from, happy, with, pericles, decision, pericles, also, gave, his, compatriots, some, advice, on, their, present, affairs, and, reassured, them, that, if, the, enemy, did, not, plunder, his, farms, he, would, offer, his, property, to, the, city, this, promise, was, prompted, by, his, concern, that, archidamus, who, was, a, friend, of, his, might, pass, by, his, estate, without, ravaging, it, either, as, a, gesture, of, friendship, or, as, a, calculated, political, move, aimed, to, alienate, pericles, from, his, constituents, in, any, case, seeing, the, pillage, of, their, farms, the, athenians, were, outraged, and, they, soon, began, to, indirectly, express, their, discontent, towards, their, leader, who, many, of, them, considered, to, have, drawn, them, into, the, war, even, when, in, the, face, of, mounting, pressure, pericles, did, not, give, in, to, the, demands, for, immediate, action, against, the, enemy, or, revise, his, initial, strategy, he, also, avoided, convening, the, ecclesia, fearing, that, the, populace, outraged, by, the, unopposed, ravaging, of, their, farms, might, rashly, decide, to, challenge, the, vaunted, spartan, army, in, the, field, as, meetings, of, the, assembly, were, called, at, the, discretion, of, its, rotating, presidents, the, prytani, singular, prytaneis, pericles, had, no, formal, control, over, their, scheduling, rather, the, respect, in, which, pericles, was, held, by, the, prytanies, was, apparently, sufficient, to, persuade, them, to, do, as, he, wished, while, the, spartan, army, remained, in, attica, pericles, sent, a, fleet, of, 100, ships, to, loot, the, coasts, of, the, peloponnese, and, charged, the, cavalry, to, guard, the, ravaged, farms, close, to, the, walls, of, the, city, when, the, enemy, retired, and, the, pillaging, came, to, an, end, pericles, proposed, a, decree, according, to, which, the, authorities, of, the, city, should, put, aside, 1, 000, talents, and, 100, ships, in, case, athens, was, attacked, by, naval, forces, according, to, the, most, stringent, provision, of, the, decree, even, proposing, a, different, use, of, the, money, or, ships, would, entail, the, penalty, of, death, during, the, autumn, of, 431, bc, pericles, led, the, athenian, forces, that, invaded, megara, and, a, few, months, later, winter, of, 431, 430, bc, he, delivered, his, monumental, and, emotional, funeral, oration, honoring, the, athenians, who, died, for, their, city, for, heroes, have, the, whole, earth, for, their, tomb, and, in, lands, far, from, their, own, where, the, column, with, its, epitaph, declares, it, there, is, enshrined, in, every, breast, a, record, unwritten, with, no, tablet, to, preserve, it, except, that, of, the, heart, in, 430, bc, the, army, of, sparta, looted, attica, for, a, second, time, but, pericles, was, not, daunted, and, refused, to, revise, his, initial, strategy, unwilling, to, engage, the, spartan, army, in, battle, he, again, led, a, naval, expedition, to, plunder, the, coasts, of, the, peloponnese, this, time, taking, 100, athenian, ships, with, him, according, to, plutarch, just, before, the, sailing, of, the, ships, an, eclipse, of, the, sun, frightened, the, crews, but, pericles, used, the, astronomical, knowledge, he, had, acquired, from, anaxagoras, to, calm, them, in, the, summer, of, the, same, year, an, epidemic, broke, out, and, devastated, the, athenians, the, exact, identity, of, the, disease, is, uncertain, typhus, or, typhoid, fever, are, suspected, but, this, has, been, the, source, of, much, debate, in, any, case, the, city, s, plight, caused, by, the, epidemic, triggered, a, new, wave, of, public, uproar, and, pericles, was, forced, to, defend, himself, in, an, emotional, final, speech, a, rendition, of, which, is, presented, by, thucydides, this, is, considered, to, be, a, monumental, oration, revealing, pericles, virtues, but, also, his, bitterness, towards, his, compatriots, ingratitude, temporarily, he, managed, to, tame, the, people, s, resentment, and, to, ride, out, the, storm, but, his, internal, enemies, final, bid, to, undermine, him, came, off, they, managed, to, deprive, him, of, the, generalship, and, to, fine, him, at, an, amount, estimated, between, 15, and, 50, talents, ancient, sources, mention, cleon, a, rising, and, dynamic, protagonist, of, the, athenian, political, scene, during, the, war, as, the, public, prosecutor, in, pericles, trial, nevertheless, within, just, a, year, in, 429, bc, the, athenians, not, only, forgave, pericles, but, also, re, elected, him, as, strategos, he, was, reinstated, in, command, of, the, athenian, army, and, led, all, its, military, operations, during, 429, bc, having, once, again, under, his, control, the, levers, of, power, in, that, year, however, pericles, witnessed, in, the, epidemic, the, death, of, both, paralus, and, xanthippus, his, legitimate, sons, from, his, first, wife, his, morale, undermined, overwhelmed, with, grief, pericles, wept, copiously, for, his, loss, and, not, even, the, companionship, of, aspasia, could, console, him, he, himself, died, of, the, plague, later, in, the, year, just, before, his, death, pericles, friends, were, concentrated, around, his, bed, enumerating, his, virtues, during, peace, and, underscoring, his, nine, war, trophies, pericles, though, moribund, heard, them, and, interrupted, them, pointing, out, that, they, forgot, to, mention, his, fairest, and, greatest, title, to, their, admiration, for, said, he, no, living, athenian, ever, put, on, mourning, because, of, me, pericles, lived, during, the, first, two, and, a, half, years, of, the, peloponnesian, war, and, according, to, thucydides, his, death, was, a, disaster, for, athens, since, his, successors, were, inferior, to, him, they, preferred, to, incite, all, the, bad, habits, of, the, rabble, and, followed, an, unstable, policy, endeavoring, to, be, popular, rather, than, useful, with, these, bitter, comments, thucydides, not, only, laments, the, loss, of, a, man, he, admired, but, he, also, heralds, the, flickering, of, athens, unique, glory, and, grandeur, pausanias, c, 150, ad, records, i, 29, seeing, the, tomb, of, pericles, along, a, road, near, the, academy, for, men, can, endure, to, hear, others, praised, only, so, long, as, they, can, severally, persuade, themselves, of, their, own, ability, to, equal, the, actions, recounted, when, this, point, is, passed, envy, comes, in, and, with, it, incredulity, pericles, following, athenian, custom, was, first, married, to, one, of, his, closest, relatives, with, whom, he, had, two, sons, paralus, and, xanthippus, but, around, 445, bc, pericles, divorced, his, wife, he, offered, her, to, another, husband, with, the, agreement, of, her, male, relatives, the, name, of, his, first, wife, is, not, known, the, only, information, about, her, is, that, she, was, the, wife, of, hipponicus, before, being, married, to, pericles, and, the, mother, of, callias, from, this, first, marriage, after, pericles, divorced, his, wife, he, had, a, long, term, relationship, with, aspasia, of, miletus, with, whom, he, had, a, son, pericles, the, younger, while, aspasia, was, held, in, high, regard, by, many, of, athens, socialites, her, status, as, a, non, athenian, led, many, to, attack, their, relationship, even, pericles, son, xanthippus, who, had, political, ambitions, did, not, hesitate, to, slander, his, father, nonetheless, such, objections, did, not, greatly, undermine, the, popularity, of, the, couple, and, pericles, readily, fought, back, against, accusations, that, his, relationship, with, aspasia, was, corrupting, of, athenian, society, his, sister, and, both, his, legitimate, sons, xanthippus, and, paralus, died, during, the, plague, of, athens, just, before, his, death, the, athenians, allowed, a, change, in, the, law, of, 451, bc, that, made, his, half, athenian, son, with, aspasia, pericles, the, younger, a, citizen, and, legitimate, heir, a, striking, decision, considering, that, pericles, himself, had, proposed, the, law, confining, citizenship, to, those, of, athenian, parentage, on, both, sides, pericles, marked, a, whole, era, and, inspired, conflicting, judgments, about, his, significant, decisions, the, fact, that, he, was, at, the, same, time, a, vigorous, statesman, general, and, orator, only, tends, to, make, an, objective, assessment, of, his, actions, more, difficult, some, contemporary, scholars, call, pericles, a, populist, a, demagogue, and, a, hawk, while, other, scholars, admire, his, charismatic, leadership, according, to, plutarch, after, assuming, the, leadership, of, athens, he, was, no, longer, the, same, man, as, before, nor, alike, submissive, to, the, people, and, ready, to, yield, and, give, in, to, the, desires, of, the, multitude, as, a, steersman, to, the, breezes, it, is, told, that, when, his, political, opponent, thucydides, was, asked, by, sparta, s, king, archidamus, whether, he, or, pericles, was, the, better, fighter, thucydides, answered, without, any, hesitation, that, pericles, was, better, because, even, when, he, was, defeated, he, managed, to, convince, the, audience, that, he, had, won, in, matters, of, character, pericles, was, above, reproach, in, the, eyes, of, the, ancient, historians, since, he, kept, himself, untainted, by, corruption, although, he, was, not, altogether, indifferent, to, money, making, thucydides, the, historian, an, admirer, of, pericles, maintains, that, athens, was, in, name, a, democracy, but, in, fact, governed, by, its, first, citizen, through, this, comment, the, historian, illustrates, what, he, perceives, as, pericles, charisma, to, lead, convince, and, sometimes, to, manipulate, although, thucydides, mentions, the, fining, of, pericles, he, does, not, mention, the, accusations, against, pericles, but, instead, focuses, on, pericles, integrity, on, the, other, hand, in, one, of, his, dialogues, plato, rejects, the, glorification, of, pericles, and, declares, as, i, know, pericles, made, the, athenians, slothful, garrulous, and, avaricious, by, starting, the, system, of, public, fees, plutarch, mentions, other, criticism, of, pericles, leadership, many, others, say, that, the, people, were, first, led, on, by, him, into, allotments, of, public, lands, festival, grants, and, distributions, of, fees, for, public, services, thereby, falling, into, bad, habits, and, becoming, luxurious, and, wanton, under, the, influence, of, his, public, measures, instead, of, frugal, and, self, sufficing, thucydides, argues, that, pericles, was, not, carried, away, by, the, people, but, he, was, the, one, guiding, the, people, his, judgement, is, not, unquestioned, some, 20th, century, critics, such, as, malcolm, f, mcgregor, and, john, s, morrison, proposed, that, he, may, have, been, a, charismatic, public, face, acting, as, an, advocate, on, the, proposals, of, advisors, or, the, people, themselves, according, to, king, by, increasing, the, power, of, the, people, the, athenians, left, themselves, with, no, authoritative, leader, during, the, peloponnesian, war, pericles, dependence, on, popular, support, to, govern, was, obvious, these, glories, may, incur, the, censure, of, the, slow, and, unambitious, but, in, the, breast, of, energy, they, will, awake, emulation, and, in, those, who, must, remain, without, them, an, envious, regret, hatred, and, unpopularity, at, the, moment, have, fallen, to, the, lot, of, all, who, have, aspired, to, rule, others, for, more, than, 20, years, pericles, led, many, expeditions, mainly, naval, ones, being, always, cautious, he, never, undertook, of, his, own, accord, a, battle, involving, much, uncertainty, and, peril, and, he, did, not, accede, to, the, vain, impulses, of, the, citizens, he, based, his, military, policy, on, themistocles, principle, that, athens, predominance, depends, on, its, superior, naval, power, and, believed, that, the, peloponnesians, were, near, invincible, on, land, pericles, also, tried, to, minimize, the, advantages, of, sparta, by, rebuilding, the, walls, of, athens, which, it, has, been, suggested, radically, altered, the, use, of, force, in, greek, international, relations, during, the, peloponnesian, war, pericles, initiated, a, defensive, grand, strategy, whose, aim, was, the, exhaustion, of, the, enemy, and, the, preservation, of, the, status, quo, according, to, platias, and, koliopoulos, athens, as, the, strongest, party, did, not, have, to, beat, sparta, in, military, terms, and, chose, to, foil, the, spartan, plan, for, victory, the, two, basic, principles, of, the, periclean, grand, strategy, were, the, rejection, of, appeasement, in, accordance, with, which, he, urged, the, athenians, not, to, revoke, the, megarian, decree, and, the, avoidance, of, overextension, according, to, kagan, pericles, vehement, insistence, that, there, should, be, no, diversionary, expeditions, may, well, have, resulted, from, the, bitter, memory, of, the, egyptian, campaign, which, he, had, allegedly, supported, his, strategy, is, said, to, have, been, inherently, unpopular, but, pericles, managed, to, persuade, the, athenian, public, to, follow, it, it, is, for, that, reason, that, hans, delbr, ck, called, him, one, of, the, greatest, statesmen, and, military, leaders, in, history, although, his, countrymen, engaged, in, several, aggressive, actions, soon, after, his, death, platias, and, koliopoulos, argue, that, the, athenians, remained, true, to, the, larger, periclean, strategy, of, seeking, to, preserve, not, expand, the, empire, and, did, not, depart, from, it, until, the, sicilian, expedition, for, his, part, ben, x, de, wet, concludes, his, strategy, would, have, succeeded, had, he, lived, longer, critics, of, pericles, strategy, however, have, been, just, as, numerous, as, its, supporters, a, common, criticism, is, that, pericles, was, always, a, better, politician, and, orator, than, strategist, donald, kagan, called, the, periclean, strategy, a, form, of, wishful, thinking, that, failed, barry, s, strauss, and, josiah, ober, have, stated, that, as, strategist, he, was, a, failure, and, deserves, a, share, of, the, blame, for, athens, great, defeat, and, victor, davis, hanson, believes, that, pericles, had, not, worked, out, a, clear, strategy, for, an, effective, offensive, action, that, could, possibly, force, thebes, or, sparta, to, stop, the, war, kagan, criticizes, the, periclean, strategy, on, four, counts, first, that, by, rejecting, minor, concessions, it, brought, about, war, second, that, it, was, unforeseen, by, the, enemy, and, hence, lacked, credibility, third, that, it, was, too, feeble, to, exploit, any, opportunities, and, fourth, that, it, depended, on, pericles, for, its, execution, and, thus, was, bound, to, be, abandoned, after, his, death, kagan, estimates, pericles, expenditure, on, his, military, strategy, in, the, peloponnesian, war, to, be, about, 2, 000, talents, annually, and, based, on, this, figure, concludes, that, he, would, have, only, enough, money, to, keep, the, war, going, for, three, years, he, asserts, that, since, pericles, must, have, known, about, these, limitations, he, probably, planned, for, a, much, shorter, war, others, such, as, donald, w, knight, conclude, that, the, strategy, was, too, defensive, and, would, not, succeed, in, contrast, platias, and, koliopoulos, reject, these, criticisms, and, state, that, the, athenians, lost, the, war, only, when, they, dramatically, reversed, the, periclean, grand, strategy, that, explicitly, disdained, further, conquests, hanson, stresses, that, the, periclean, strategy, was, not, innovative, but, could, lead, to, a, stagnancy, in, favor, of, athens, it, is, a, popular, conclusion, that, those, succeeding, him, lacked, his, abilities, and, character, modern, commentators, of, thucydides, with, other, modern, historians, and, writers, take, varying, stances, on, the, issue, of, how, much, of, the, speeches, of, pericles, as, given, by, this, historian, do, actually, represent, pericles, own, words, and, how, much, of, them, is, free, literary, creation, or, paraphrase, by, thucydides, since, pericles, never, wrote, down, or, distributed, his, orations, no, historians, are, able, to, answer, this, with, certainty, thucydides, recreated, three, of, them, from, memory, and, thereby, it, cannot, be, ascertained, that, he, did, not, add, his, own, notions, and, thoughts, although, pericles, was, a, main, source, of, his, inspiration, some, historians, have, noted, that, the, passionate, and, idealistic, literary, style, of, the, speeches, thucydides, attributes, to, pericles, is, completely, at, odds, with, thucydides, own, cold, and, analytical, writing, style, this, might, however, be, the, result, of, the, incorporation, of, the, genre, of, rhetoric, into, the, genre, of, historiography, that, is, to, say, thucydides, could, simply, have, used, two, different, writing, styles, for, two, different, purposes, ioannis, kakridis, and, arnold, gomme, were, two, scholars, who, debated, the, originality, of, pericles, oratory, and, last, speech, kakridis, believes, that, thucydides, altered, pericles, words, some, of, his, strongest, arguments, included, in, the, introduction, of, the, speech, thuc, 11, 35, kakridis, proposes, that, it, is, impossible, to, imagine, pericles, deviating, away, from, the, expected, funeral, orator, addressing, the, mourning, audience, of, 430, after, the, peloponnesian, war, the, two, groups, addressed, were, the, ones, who, were, prepared, to, believe, him, when, he, praised, the, dead, and, the, ones, who, did, not, gomme, rejects, kakridis, s, position, defending, the, fact, that, nobody, of, men, has, ever, been, so, conscious, of, envy, and, its, workings, as, the, greeks, and, that, the, greeks, and, thucydides, in, particular, had, a, passion, for, covering, all, ground, in, their, generalizations, not, always, relevantly, kagan, states, that, pericles, adopted, an, elevated, mode, of, speech, free, from, the, vulgar, and, knavish, tricks, of, mob, orators, and, according, to, diodorus, siculus, he, excelled, all, his, fellow, citizens, in, skill, of, oratory, according, to, plutarch, he, avoided, using, gimmicks, in, his, speeches, unlike, the, passionate, demosthenes, and, always, spoke, in, a, calm, and, tranquil, manner, the, biographer, points, out, however, that, the, poet, ion, reported, that, pericles, speaking, style, was, a, presumptuous, and, somewhat, arrogant, manner, of, address, and, that, into, his, haughtiness, there, entered, a, good, deal, of, disdain, and, contempt, for, others, gorgias, in, plato, s, homonymous, dialogue, uses, pericles, as, an, example, of, powerful, oratory, in, menexenus, however, socrates, through, plato, casts, aspersions, on, pericles, rhetorical, fame, claiming, ironically, that, since, pericles, was, educated, by, aspasia, a, trainer, of, many, orators, he, would, be, superior, in, rhetoric, to, someone, educated, by, antiphon, he, also, attributes, authorship, of, the, funeral, oration, to, aspasia, and, attacks, his, contemporaries, veneration, of, pericles, sir, richard, c, jebb, concludes, that, unique, as, an, athenian, statesman, pericles, must, have, been, in, two, respects, unique, also, as, an, athenian, orator, first, because, he, occupied, such, a, position, of, personal, ascendancy, as, no, man, before, or, after, him, attained, secondly, because, his, thoughts, and, his, moral, force, won, him, such, renown, for, eloquence, as, no, one, else, ever, got, from, athenians, ancient, greek, writers, call, pericles, olympian, and, extol, his, talents, referring, to, him, thundering, and, lightning, and, exciting, greece, and, carrying, the, weapons, of, zeus, when, orating, according, to, quintilian, pericles, would, always, prepare, assiduously, for, his, orations, and, before, going, on, the, rostrum, he, would, always, pray, to, the, gods, so, as, not, to, utter, any, improper, word, nothing, was, more, alien, to, the, greeks, than, the, notion, of, a, separation, between, church, and, state, in, athens, the, community, provided, a, tight, framework, for, religious, manifestations, while, symmetrically, religion, was, deeply, embedded, in, civic,

spokesman, of, a, civic, religion, that, was, undergoing, a, mutation, he, was, implicated, in, a, policy, of, making, constant, offerings, and, of, launching, huge, architectural, religious, works, not, only, on, the, acropolis, but, also, throughout, attica, and, furthermore, he, was, engaged, in, such, activities, at, a, time, when, city, was, introducing, profound, changes, into, its, religious, account, of, its, origins, that, is, autochthony, within, a, context, of, strained, diplomatic, relations, on, the, other, hand, the, ancient, sources, made, it, possible, to, glimpse, the, personal, relations, that, pericles, had, developed, with, gods, these, were, relations, of, proximity, in, the, first, place, he, was, sometimes, depicted, as, a, prot, g, of, goddess, athena, but, in, attic, comedies, he, was, also, assimilated, to, god, zeus, in, an, analogy, that, was, in, no, way, flattering, but, then, there, were, also, relations, that, emphasized, distance, some, philosophical, accounts, presented, him, as, a, man, close, to, the, sophists, or, even, as, a, freethinker, finally, there, were, relations, involving, irreverence, some, later, and, less, trustworthy, sources, made, much, of, several, trials, for, impiety, in, which, those, close, to, him, were, involved, and, this, raises, the, question, of, religious, tolerance, in, fifth, century, athens, and, in, particular, how, far, individuals, enjoyed, freedom, of, thought, when, faced, with, the, civic, community, pericles, most, visible, legacy, can, be, found, in, the, literary, and,

athenian, imperialism, which, denies, true, democracy, and, freedom, to, the, people, of, all, but, the, ruling, state, the, promotion, of, such, an, arrogant, imperialism, is, said, to, have, ruined,
