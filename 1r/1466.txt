party, rival, candidate, and, leader, of, the, csu, edmund, stoiber, was, much, more, popular, within, the, party, at, the, time, in, a, private, negotiation, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, wolfratshausen, breakfast, merkel, agreed, to, cede, the, opportunity, to, challenge, schr, der, to, stoiber, in, exchange, she, was, to, become, leader, of, the, cdu, csu, faction, in, the, bundestag, following, the, election, although, pre, election, polling, had, indicated, that, voters, strongly, favoured, stoiber, he, went, on, to, lose, the, election, by, a, thin, margin, the, election, campaign, was, dominated, by, the, iraq, war, while, chancellor, schr, der, had, made, clear, he, would, not, join, the, war, in, iraq, merkel, was, in, support, of, the, war, at, the, time, although, she, later, claimed, that, she, had, opposed, it, after, stoiber, s, defeat, in, 2002, in, addition, to, her, role, as, cdu, leader, merkel, became, leader, of, the, opposition, in, the, bundestag, as, had, been, agreed, upon, between, her, and, stoiber, friedrich, merz, who, had, held, the, post, prior, to, the, 2002, election, was, eased, out, to, make, way, for, merkel, merkel, supported, a, substantial, reform, agenda, for, germany, s, economic, and, social, system, and, was, considered, more, pro, market, than, her, own, party, the, cdu, she, advocated, german, labour, law, changes, specifically, removing, barriers, to, laying, off, employees, and, increasing, the, allowed, number, of, work, hours, in, a, week, she, argued, that, existing, laws, made, the, country, less, competitive, because, companies, could, not, easily, control, labour, costs, when, business, was, slow, merkel, argued, that, germany, should, phase, out, nuclear, power, less, quickly, than, the, schr, der, administration, had, planned, merkel, advocated, a, strong, transatlantic, partnership, and, german, american, friendship, in, the, spring, of, 2003, defying, strong, public, opposition, merkel, came, out, in, favour, of, the, 2003, invasion, of, iraq, describing, it, as, unavoidable, she, also, criticised, the, government, s, support, for, the, accession, of, turkey, to, the, european, union, instead, arguing, in, favour, of, a, privileged, partnership, on, 30, may, 2005, merkel, won, the, cdu, csu, nomination, to, challenge, chancellor, gerhard, schr, der, of, the, spd, in, the, 2005, federal, elections, her, party, began, the, campaign, with, a, 21, point, lead, over, the, spd, in, national, opinion, polls, although, her, personal, popularity, lagged, behind, that, of, the, incumbent, however, the, cdu, csu, campaign, suffered, when, merkel, having, made, economic, competence, central, to, the, cdu, s, platform, confused, gross, and, net, income, twice, during, a, televised, debate, she, regained, some, momentum, after, she, announced, that, she, would, appoint, paul, kirchhof, a, former, judge, at, the, german, constitutional, court, and, leading, fiscal, policy, expert, as, minister, of, finance, merkel, and, the, cdu, lost, ground, after, kirchhof, proposed, the, introduction, of, a, flat, tax, in, germany, again, undermining, the, party, s, broad, appeal, on, economic, affairs, this, was, compounded, by, merkel, s, proposal, to, increase, vat, to, reduce, germany, s, deficit, and, fill, the, gap, in, revenue, from, a, flat, tax, the, spd, were, able, to, increase, their, support, simply, by, pledging, not, to, introduce, flat, taxes, or, increase, vat, although, merkel, s, standing, recovered, after, she, distanced, herself, from, kirchhof, s, proposals, she, remained, considerably, less, popular, than, schr, der, who, had, been, perceived, as, the, more, generally, competent, and, trustworthy, candidate, the, cdu, s, lead, was, down, to, 9, percentage, points, on, the, eve, of, the, election, with, merkel, having, a, significant, lead, in, popularity, based, on, opinion, polls, on, 18, september, 2005, merkel, s, cdu, csu, and, schr, der, s, spd, went, head, to, head, in, the, national, elections, with, the, cdu, csu, winning, 35, 2, cdu, 27, 8, csu, 7, 5, of, the, second, votes, to, the, spd, s, 34, 2, the, result, was, so, close, that, both, schr, der, and, merkel, initially, claimed, victory, neither, the, spd, green, coalition, nor, the, cdu, csu, and, its, preferred, coalition, partners, the, free, democratic, party, held, enough, seats, to, form, a, majority, in, the, bundestag, a, grand, coalition, between, the, cdu, csu, and, spd, would, face, the, challenge, of, both, parties, demanding, the, chancellorship, however, after, three, weeks, of, negotiations, the, two, parties, reached, a, deal, for, a, grand, coalition, whereby, merkel, would, become, chancellor, and, the, spd, would, hold, 8, of, the, 16, seats, in, the, cabinet, the, deal, was, approved, by, both, parties, at, party, conferences, on, 14, november, 2005, merkel, was, elected, chancellor, by, the, majority, of, delegates, 397, to, 217, in, the, newly, assembled, bundestag, on, 22, november, 2005, but, 51, members, of, the, governing, coalition, voted, against, her, reports, at, the, time, indicated, that, the, grand, coalition, would, pursue, a, mix, of, policies, some, of, which, differed, from, merkel, s, political, platform, as, leader, of, the, opposition, and, candidate, for, chancellor, the, coalition, s, intent, was, to, cut, public, spending, whilst, increasing, vat, from, 16, to, 19, social, insurance, contributions, and, the, top, rate, of, income, tax, when, announcing, the, coalition, agreement, merkel, stated, that, the, main, aim, of, her, government, would, be, to, reduce, unemployment, and, that, it, was, this, issue, on, which, her, government, would, be, judged, reform, of, the, german, healthcare, system, was, a, salient, issue, during, the, 2005, election, the, previous, system, had, been, criticised, as, inefficient, and, overly, bureaucratic, after, a, significant, period, of, negotiations, a, deal, was, passed, in, 2006, while, this, agreement, was, described, as, having, saved, the, coalition, government, it, was, also, widely, criticised, as, ineffectual, the, deal, also, increased, the, tax, burden, on, employers, and, their, publicly, insured, employees, the, 2006, round, of, reforms, introduced, the, health, insurance, duty, which, establishes, that, individuals, must, be, insured, either, through, the, public, insurance, system, or, through, private, insurance, firms, and, accordingly, cannot, be, uninsured, the, reforms, also,

the, government, would, guarantee, private, savings, account, deposits, after, all, however, two, days, later, on, 6, october, 2008, it, emerged, that, the, pledge, was, simply, a, political, move, that, would, not, be, backed, by, legislation, most, other, european, governments, eventually, either, raised, the, limits, or, promised, to, guarantee, savings, in, full, the, german, government, stepped, in, to, assist, the, mortgage, company, hypo, real, estate, with, a, bailout, the, deal, was, agreed, upon, on, 6, october, with, german, banks, contributing, 30, billion, and, the, bundesbank, 20, billion, to, an, emergency, credit, line, at, the, time, of, the, greek, government, debt, crisis, germany, was, the, largest, creditor, of, the, greek, government, giving, it, significant, negotiating, power, merkel, is, often, credited, as, having, saved, the, euro, primarily, due, to, her, coordinating, role, in, the, development, of, debt, relief, policy, the, austerity, measures, imposed, on, debtors, such, as, greece, which, were, a, significant, part, of, merkel, s, position, in, the, negotiations, have, been, criticised, as, overly, harsh, by, some, observers, critics, also, highlighted, germany, s, own, debt, management, issues, a, bloomberg, opinion, piece, noted, that, irresponsible, borrowers, can, t, exist, without, irresponsible, lenders, accordingly,

agreed, to, the, measures, the, november, 2015, paris, attacks, prompted, a, reevaluation, of, the, german, government, s, stance, on, eu, migration, policy, while, she, did, not, directly, limit,

right, wing, electoral, preferences, across, germany, with, the, alternative, for, germany, afd, gaining, 12, of, the, vote, in, the, 2017, german, federal, election, these, developments, prompted, debates, over, the, reasons, for, increased, right, wing, populism, in, germany, some, researchers, have, argued, that, increased, right, wing, preferences, are, a, result, of, the, european, migrant, crisis, particularly, the, increasingly, common, perception, that, refugees, constitute, an, ethnic, and, cultural, threat, to, germany, some, observers, have, described, merkel, s, policymaking, with, respect, to, the, migrant, crisis, as, a, success, in, 2022, the, united, nations, high, commissioner, for, refugees, granted, merkel, the, nansen, award, for, her, courage, and, compassion, during, the, crisis, however, merkel, has, also, faced, significant, criticism, particularly, with, regards, to, her, policymaking, early, in, the, crisis, which, some, critics, describe, as, hypocritically, unilateral, in, the, 2017, federal, election, merkel, led, her, party, to, victory, for, the, fourth, time, however, both, the, cdu, csu, and, the, spd, received, a, significantly, lower, proportion, of, the, vote, than, they, did, in, 2013, and, the, cdu, csu, subsequently, attempted, to, form, a, coalition, with, the, fdp, and, greens, the, spd, announced, that, they, would, go, into, the, opposition, both, due, to, their, loss, of, popular, support, and, because, the, idea, of, another, grand, coalition, was, widely, unpopular, at, the, time, the, fdp, eventually, withdrew, from, negotiations, with, the, cdu, csu, leading, to, a, stalemate, the, german, president, frank, walter, steinmeier, subsequently, appealed, successfully, to, the, spd, to, change, their, hard, stance, against, coalition, with, the, cdu, csu, and, the, spd, agreed, to, a, third, grand, coalition, with, the, cdu, csu, the, negotiations, leading, up, to, this, agreement, were, the, longest, in, german, post, war, history, lasting, almost, six, months, a, yougov, survey, published, in, late, december, 2017, found, that, just, 36, of, all, respondents, wanted, merkel, to, stay,

countries, agreed, to, take, them, back, merkel, feared, that, unilaterally, sending, migrants, back, to, neighbouring, countries, without, seeking, a, multilateral, european, agreement, could, endanger, the, stability, of, the, european, union, in, june, 2018, seehofer, issued, an, ultimatum, to, merkel, as, interior, minister, he, could, unilaterally, implement, the, policy, without, her,

challenge, for, our, country, in, which, action, in, a, spirit, of, solidarity, on, our, part, was, so, important, the, speech, was, well, received, both, nationally, and, internationally, receiving, widespread, attention, and, an, award, for, speech, of, the, year, on, 6, april, 2020, merkel, stated, in, my, view, the, european, union, is, facing, the, biggest, test, since, its, foundation, and,

a, meeting, of, younger, members, of, her, conservative, christian, democratic, union, cdu, party, at, potsdam, that, attempts, to, build, a, multicultural, society, in, germany, had, utterly, failed, stating, that, the, concept, that, we, are, now, living, side, by, side, and, are, happy, about, it, does, not, work, and, we, feel, attached, to, the, christian, concept, of, mankind, that, is, what,

she, went, on, to, say, that, europe, could, only, maintain, its, prosperity, by, being, innovative, and, measuring, itself, against, the, best, after, this, the, comparison, became, a, central, element, in, major, speeches, the, international, financial, press, has, widely, commented, on, her, thesis, with, the, economist, saying, if, mrs, merkel, s, vision, is, pragmatic, so, too, is, her, plan, for, implementing, it, it, can, be, boiled, down, to, three, statistics, a, few, charts, and, some, facts, on, an, a4, sheet, of, paper, the, three, figures, are, 7, percent, 25, percent, and, 50, percent, mrs, merkel, never, tires, of, saying, that, europe, has, 7, percent, of, the, world, s, population, 25, percent, of, its, gdp, and, 50, percent, of, its, social, spending, if, the, region, is, to, prosper, in, competition, with, emerging, countries, it, cannot, continue, to, be, so, generous, she, produces, graphs, of, unit, labour, costs, at, eu, meetings, in, much, the, same, way, that, the, late, margaret, thatcher, used, to, pull, passages, from, friedrich, hayek, s, road, to, serfdom, from, her, handbag, the, financial, times, commented, although, ms, merkel, stopped, short, of, suggesting, that, a, ceiling, on, social, spending, might, be, one, yardstick, for, measuring, competitiveness, she, hinted, as, much, in, the, light, of, soaring, social, spending, in, the, face, of, an, ageing, population, merkel, has, been, credited, as, a, key, part, of, 2007, g8, negotiations, that, led, to, a, significantly, more, ambitious, renewable, energy, transition,

2023, the, plan, also, aimed, at, a, 40, reduction, of, greenhouse, gas, emissions, by, 2020, a, goal, that, was, initially, achieved, largely, due, to, reductions, in, demand, during, the, covid, 19,

change, that, year, in, 2017, merkel, criticised, the, trump, administration, s, decision, to, withdraw, from, the, 2015, paris, agreement, and, reaffirmed, the, commitment, of, the, remaining, g20, members, to, the, treaty, in, early, 2019, a, governmental, commission, appointed, by, the, coalition, government, approved, a, plan, to, phase, out, coal, power, plants, by, 2038, allocating, a,
