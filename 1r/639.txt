organ, claims, that, lean, often, straddl, that, fine, line, between, commercialism, and, artistry, to, view, one, of, lean, s, films, is, to, see, the, complete, spectrum, of, tools, available, to, the, filmmaker, and, used, to, their, fullest, potential, according, to, david, ehrenstein, what, all, brilliant, seemingly, disparate, works, have, in, common, is, the, clarity, and, precision, of, lean, s, filmmaking, technique, as, well, as, his, steely, resolve, in, using, it, to, attain, poetic, grandeur, michael, sragow, calls, lean, a, superb, romantic, moviemaker, and, one, of, the, slow, but, steady, innovators, of, the, cinema, though, lean, is, usually, praised, for, his, film, sense, as, though, it, were, divorced, from, his, other, faculties, he, s, done, as, much, as, men, of,

and, larger, than, life, characters, in, a, sometimes, hallucinatory, atmosphere, has, inspired, generations, of, filmmakers, to, try, to, fuse, the, most, ruthless, documentation, with, the, most, elaborate, myth, making, he, further, highlights, lean, s, use, of, highly, charged, staging, and, editing, and, a, lucid, fluid, realism, to, depict, the, contrast, between, ongoing, life, and, life, at, its, extremes, on, the, occasion, of, lean, s, centenary, in, 2008, writer, and, broadcaster, andrew, collins, praised, him, as, more, than, just, cinema, s, great, choreographer, of, scale, certainly, he, set, the, bar, high, for, heavily, populated, location, shot, period, sagas, from, literary, sources, but, it, would, be, shortsighted, to, see, lean, s, greatest, achievements, as, the, filmic, equivalent, of, skyscraping, architectural, edifices, good, because, they, re, there, the, people, may, look, like, ants, when, first, glimpsed, against, the, vast, sand, dunes, of, an, exacting, lean, composition, or, the, icy, russian, mountains, or, the, concrete, fa, ade, of, a, dam, but, we, are, soon, invited, to, alight, on, individuals, and, through, the, use, of, simple, visual, clues, wonder, about, them, and, care, about, them, alain, silver, analyses, lean, s, technique, as, one, that, elucidates, story, and, characters, through, pictures, he, states, that, lean, is, able, to, subjectify, a, film, s, perspective, through, visuals, regardless, of, whether, the, film, has, a, third, person, or, first, person, narrative, since, most, of, lean, s, narratives, are, organised, in, a, way, which, is, neither, first, nor, third, person, shots, or, sequences, may, suddenly, shift, the, film, into, either, mode, without, disrupting, or, overwhelming, the, basic, structure, subjectivity, might, be, accomplished, in, several, ways, the, narrative, itself, may, be, literally, bracketed, by, being, presented, as, a, flashback, from, either, the, central, character, brief, encounter, the, passionate, friends, a, subordinate, one, doctor, zhivago, or, a, combination, in, which, we, serve, and, implicitly, lawrence, of, arabia, in, any, narrative, context, shots, may, be, intercut, to, suggest, the, thoughts, or, sensations, of, a, character, as, in, oliver, twist, and, brief, encounter, or, characters, as, in, the, sparking, streetcar, terminal, when, zhivago, and, his, still, unknown, future, love, lara, brush, against, each, other, early, in, that, film, shots, may, become, literally, what, the, character, sees, or, shots, of,

where, there, is, no, point, of, view, shot, of, the, terrible, event, but, merely, a, slow, move, in, to, reveal, the, horror, on, the, actors, faces, lean, was, notorious, for, his, perfectionist, approach, to, filmmaking, director, claude, chabrol, stated, that, he, and, lean, were, the, only, directors, working, at, the, time, who, were, prepared, to, wait, forever, for, the, perfect, sunset, but, whereas, chabrol, measured, forever, in, terms, of, days, lean, did, so, in, terms, of, months, similarly, hugh, hudson, writing, shortly, after, lean, s, death, in, 1991, called, him, man, driven, to, achieve, the, perfect, realisation, of, his, ideas, and, ruthless, in, that, pursuit, he, goes, on, to, describe, the, filmmaker, s, method, of, working, with, actors, lean, always, had, a, clear, idea, of, how, his, characters, should, be, portrayed, and, would, not, accept, much, deviation, he, had, a, reputation, for, being, tough, with, his, actors, and, for, refusing, to, let, them, indulge, in, their, natural, propensity, for, histrionics, yet, once, the, rules, were, laid, down, lean, allowed, his, actors, considerable, space, for, interpretation, and, he, showed, a, genuine, understanding, of, their, exposed, position, in, front, of, the, camera, lean, would, set, his, actors, in, the, landscape, by, giving, them, the, feeling, of, being, in, that, time, and, at, that, place, this, is, where, the, talent, of, a, great, director, comes, in, setting, a, scene, mise, en, sc, ne, creating, a, climate, painting, a, picture, within, the, story, and, at, the, same, time, never, losing, the, telling, of, that, story, steven, ross, has, written, that, lean, s, films, reveal, a, consistently, tragic, vision, of, the, romantic, sensibility, attempting, to, reach, beyond, the, constraints, and, restrictions, of, everyday, life, and, that, they, tend, to, feature, intimate, stories, of, a, closely, knit, group, of, characters, fates, are, indirectly, but, powerfully, shaped, by, history, shaking, events, going, on, around, them, he, further, observes, that, in, his, work, setting, as, a, presence, with, as, much, dramatic, and, thematic, form, as, any, character, in, the, film, similarly, lean, biographer, gene, d, phillips, writes, that, the, director, saw, in, his, style, an, attraction, to, characters, who, refuse, to, accept, defeat, even, when, their, most, cherished, hopes, go, unfulfilled, his, protagonists, seek, to, transform, their, lives, but, often, fail, to, do, so, pip, in, great, expectations, colonel, nicholson, in, the, bridge, on, the, river, kwai, and, t, e, lawrence, in, lawrence, of, arabia, among, others, struggle, against, the, limitations, of, their, own, personalities, to, achieve, a, level, of, existence, that, they, deem, higher, or, nobler, according, to, silver, lean, s, signature, characters, are, ordinary, dreamers, and, epic, visionaries, people, who, want, to, transform, the, world, according, to, their, expectations, the, tragic, flaw, in, lean, s, characters, is, a, self, centeredness, which, can, lead, to, misimpression, which, can, prevent, them, from, seeing, what, is, so, clear, to, everyone, else, in, sragow, s, view, lean, has, depicted, the, need, for, constricted, modern, men, and, women, either, to, act, out, their, dreams, or, preserve, the, life, they, have, by, making, a, scene, or, putting, on, a, show, indulging, in, the, histrionic, to, renew, their, sense, of, self, and, purpose, michael, newton, of, the, guardian, analysing, brief, encounter, and, doctor, zhivago, says, today, 50, years, on, we, can, see, how, the, scale, of, zhivago, forms, the, measure, of, its, appeal, and, its, gorgeousness, seems, intrinsic, to, one, of, cinema, s, virtues, with, charlie, chaplin, alfred, hitchcock, and, michael, powell, lean, is, one, of, the, greatest, film, directors, this, country, has, produced, like, all, of, them, he, is, a, romantic, and, romanticism, was, his, subject, matter, the, flourishing, and, the, breaking, of, inordinate, desires, the, dangerous, lure, of, beauty, of, adventure, and, the, untrammelled, life, both, films, demonstrate, the, impossibility, of, an, illicit, love, finding, a, place, in, the, world, in, brief, encounter, social, convention, and, decency, prevent, it, romance, flourishes, only, to, be, worn, out, by, the, talk, of, casual, acquaintances, in, doctor, zhivago, it, is, history, and, the, political, realm, that, prove, to, be, love, s, enemy, hudson, considers, the, director, an, important, chronicler, of, the, british, character, in, the, 20th, century, born, in, the, edwardian, era, lean, experienced, first, hand, the, decline, of, the, british, empire, he, lived, through, two, world, wars, and, matured, as, an, artist, during, the, 50s, when, britain, was, being, forced, to, re, examine, her, new, role, his, natural, taste, was, for, a, mixture, of, the, nineteenth, century, novel, and, landscape, painting, of, the, same, period, something, he, never, tried, nor, wanted, to, change, but, having, grown, up, during, the, demise, of, british, influence, in, the, world, he, also, had, an, acutely, critical, view, of, british, society, so, lean, s, work, contains, an, interesting, paradox, the, strong, visual, and, literary, legacy, of, british, culture, which, he, loved, and, understood, so, well, combined, with, biting, insights, into, the, ludicrous, aspects, of, a, nation, being, forced, to, accept, a, less, important, role, in, the, world, a, perfect, example, of, this, ability, to, illustrate, britain, s, dilemma, is, the, portrayal, of, the, colonel, in, the, bridge, on, the, river, kwai, 1957, here, is, a, man, using, the, military, discipline, that, was, the, result, of, hundreds, of, years, of, british, tradition, to, survive, the, hardships, torture, and, degradation, of, being, a, japanese, prisoner, of, war, yet, whose, addiction, to, that, same, discipline, and, tradition, has, turned, him, mad, the, man, is, both, a, hero, and, a, fool, a, remarkable, device, to, illustrate, the, state, of, britain, as, she, clung, to, meaningless, tradition, in, a, futile, attempt, to, save, her, identity, in, the, face, of, declining, power, several, critics, have, found, a, close, relationship, between, style, and, theme, in, lean, s, work, john, orr, author, of, romantics, and, modernists, in, british, cinema, examines, lean, in, terms, of, the, stylised, oscillation, of, romance, and, restraint, that, shapes, so, much, of, his, work, as, well, as, of, the, intersection, of, culture, and, nature, where, a, story, s, momentous, events, are, not, only, framed, against, landscape, settings, but, also, integrated, into, the, very, texture, of, the, image, that, his, camera, produces, he, argues, that, lean, could, have, given, us, kitsch, syrupy, imitations, of, landscape, photography, but, his, staging, and, cutting, blend, so, fluently, that, his, evocation, of, the, romantic, sublime, is, linked, inextricably, to, his, d, coupage, and, sense, of, place, in, the, rough, guide, to, film, tom, charity, argues, it, s, in, the, cutting, that, you, feel, both, the, romantic, ardour, and, the, repression, that, create, the, central, tension, in, work, steven, spielberg, and, martin, scorsese, in, particular, are, fans, of, lean, s, epic, films, and, claim, him, as, one, of, their, primary, influences, spielberg, and, scorsese, also, helped, in, the, 1989, restoration, of, lawrence, of, arabia, which, had, been, substantially, altered, both, by, the, studio, in, theatrical, release, and, in, particular, in, its, televised, versions, the, theatrical, re, release, greatly, revived, lean, s, reputation, several, of, the, many, other, later, directors, who, have, acknowledged, significant, influence, by, lean, include, stanley, kubrick, francis, ford, coppola, george, lucas, spike, lee, sergio, leone, sir, john, boorman, paul, thomas, anderson, lawrence, kasdan, and, guillermo, del, toro, john, woo, once, named, lawrence, of, arabia, among, his, top, three, films, more, recently, joe, wright, pride, prejudice, atonement, has, cited, lean, s, works, particularly, doctor, zhivago, as, an, important, influence, on, his, work, as, has, director, christopher, nolan, the, dark, knight, rises, the, critical, verdict, was, not, unanimous, however, for, example, david, thomson, writing, about, lean, in, his, new, biographical, dictionary, of, film, comments, from, 1952, to, 1991, he, made, eight, films, and, in, only, one, of, them, i, suggest, lawrence, is, the, spectacle, sufficient, to, mask, the, hollow, rhetoric, of, the, scripts, but, lean, before, 1952, made, eight, films, in, ten, years, that, are, lively, stirring, and, an, inspiration, they, make, you, want, to, go, out, and, make, movies, they, are, so, in, love, with, the, screen, s, power, and, the, combustion, in, editing, the, new, york, times, film, critic, bosley, crowther, dismissed, lawrence, of, arabia, as, a, huge, thundering, camel, opera, that, tends, to, run, down, rather, badly, as, it, rolls, on, into, its, third, hour, and, gets, involved, with, sullen, disillusion, and, political, deceit, writing, in, the, village, voice, andrew, sarris, remarked, that, lawrence, was, simply, another, expensive, mirage, dull, overlong, and, coldly, impersonal, on, the, whole, i, find, it, hatefully, calculating, and, condescending
