previous, generation, notably, swift, and, gay, fielding, followed, this, with, joseph, andrews, 1742, an, original, work, supposedly, dealing, with, pamela, s, brother, joseph, his, purpose, however, was, more, than, parody, for, as, stated, in, the, preface, he, intended, a, kind, of, writing, which, i, do, not, remember, to, have, seen, hitherto, attempted, in, our, language, in, what, fielding, called, a, comic, epic, poem, in, prouse, he, blended, two, classical, traditions, that, of, the, epic, which, had, been, poetic, and, that, of, the, drama, but, emphasizing, the, comic, rather, than, the, tragic, another, distinction, of, joseph, andrews, and, the, novels, to, come, was, use, of, everyday, reality, of, character, and, action, as, opposed, to, the, fables, of, the, past, while, begun, as, a, parody, it, developed, into, an, accomplished, novel, in, its, own, right, and, is, seen, as, fielding, s, debut, as, a, serious, novelist, in, 1743, he, published, a, novel, in, the, miscellanies, volume, iii, which, was, the, first, volume, of, the, miscellanies, the, life, and, death, of, jonathan, wild, the, great, which, is, sometimes, counted, as, his, first, as, he, almost, certainly, began, it, before, he, wrote, shamela, and, joseph, andrews, it, is, a, satire, of, walpole, equating, him, and, jonathan, wild, the, gang, leader, and, highwayman, he, implicitly, compares, the, whig, party, in, parliament, with, a, gang, of, thieves, run, by, walpole, whose, constant, desire, to, be, a, great, man, a, common, epithet, with, walpole, ought, to, culminate, in,

marriage, this, was, one, of, several, small, pamphlets, costing, sixpence, though, a, minor, piece, in, his, life, s, work, it, reflects, his, preoccupation, with, fraud, shamming, and, masks, his, greatest, work, is, the, history, of, tom, jones, a, foundling, 1749, a, meticulous, comic, novel, with, elements, of, the, picaresque, and, the, bildungsroman, telling, a, convoluted, tale, of, how, a, foundling, came, into, a, fortune, the, novel, tells, of, tom, s, alienation, from, his, foster, father, squire, allworthy, and, his, sweetheart, sophia, western, and, his, reconciliation, with, them, after, lively, and, dangerous, adventures, on, the, road, and, in, london, it, triumphs, as, a, presentation, of, english, life, and, character, in, the, mid, 18th, century, every, social, type, is, represented, and, through, them, every, shade, of, moral, behaviour, fielding, s, varied, style, tempers, the, basic, seriousness, of, the, novel, and, his, authorial, comment, before, each, chapter, adds, a, dimension, to, a, conventional, straightforward, narrative, fielding, s, younger, sister, sarah, also, became, a, successful, writer, her, novel, the, governess, or, the, little, female, academy, 1749, is, thought, to, be, the, first, in, english, aimed, expressly, at, children, fielding, married, charlotte, craddock, in, 1734, at, the, church, of, st, mary, in, charlcombe,

despite, the, scandal, fielding, s, consistent, anti, jacobitism, and, support, for, the, church, of, england, led, to, his, appointment, a, year, later, as, westminster, s, chief, magistrate, while, his, literary, career, went, from, strength, to, strength, most, of, his, work, concerned, london, s, criminal, population, of, thieves, informers, gamblers, and, prostitutes, though, living, in, a, corrupt, and, callous, society, he, became, noted, for, impartial, judgements, incorruptibility, and, compassion, for, those, whom, social, inequities, led, into, crime, the, income, from, his, office, the, dirtiest, money, upon, earth, dwindled, as, he, refused, to, take, money, from, the, very, poor, joined, by, his, younger, half, brother, john, he, helped, found, what, some, call, london, s, first, police, force, the, bow, street, runners, in, 1749, according, to, the, historian, g, m, trevelyan, the, fieldings, were, two, of, the, best, magistrates, in, 18th, century, london, who, did, much, to, enhance, judicial, reform, and, improve, prison, conditions, fielding, s, influential, pamphlets, and, enquiries, included, a, proposal, for, abolishing, public, hangings, this, did, not, however, imply, opposition, to, capital, punishment, as, such, as, is, evident, for, example, in, his, presiding, in, 1751, over, the, trial, of, the, notorious, criminal, james, field, finding, him, guilty, in, a, robbery, and, sentencing, him, to, hang, john, fielding, despite, being, blind, by, then, succeeded, his, older, brother, as, chief, magistrate, becoming, known, as, the,
