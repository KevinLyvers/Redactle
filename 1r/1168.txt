charles, martel, m, r, t, l, c, 688, 22, october, 741, martel, being, a, sobriquet, in, old, french, for, the, hammer, was, a, frankish, political, and, military, leader, who, as, duke, and, prince, of, the, franks, and, mayor, of, the, palace, was, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, franks, from, 718, until, his, death, he, was, a, son, of, the, frankish, statesman, pepin, of, herstal, and, a, noblewoman, named, alpaida, charles, successfully, asserted, his, claims, to, power, as, successor, to, his, father, as, the, power, behind, the, throne, in, frankish, politics, continuing, and, building, on, his, father, s, work, he, restored, centralized, government, in, francia, and, began, the, series, of, military, campaigns, that, re, established, the, franks, as, the, undisputed, masters, of, all, gaul, according, to, a, near, contemporary, source, the, liber, historiae, francorum, charles, was, a, warrior, who, was, uncommonly, effective, in, battle, charles, gained, a, very, consequential, victory, against, an, umayyad, invasion, of, aquitaine, at, the, battle, of, tours, at, a, time, when, the, umayyad, caliphate, controlled, most, of, the, iberian, peninsula, alongside, his, military, endeavours, charles, has, been, traditionally, credited, with, an, influential, role, in, the, development, of, the, frankish, system, of, feudalism, at, the, end, of, his, reign, charles, divided, francia, between, his, sons, carloman, and, pepin, the, latter, became, the, first, king, of, the, carolingian, dynasty, pepin, s, son, charlemagne, grandson, of, charles, extended, the, frankish, realms, and, became, the, first, emperor, in, the, west, since, the, fall, of, the, western, roman, empire, charles, nicknamed, martel, the, hammer, in, later, chronicles, was, a, son, of, pepin, of, herstal, and, his, mistress, possible, second, wife, alpaida, he, had, a, brother, named, childebrand, who, later, became, the, frankish, dux, that, is, duke, of, burgundy, older, historiography, commonly, describes, charles, as, illegitimate, but, the, dividing, line, between, wives, and, concubines, was, not, clear, cut, in, eighth, century, francia, it, is, likely, that, the, accusation, of, illegitimacy, derives, from, the, desire, of, pepin, s, first, wife, plectrude, to, see, her, progeny, as, heirs, to, pepin, s, throne, by, charles, s, lifetime, the, merovingians, had, ceded, power, to, the, mayors, of, the, palace, who, controlled, the, royal, treasury, dispensed, patronage, and, granted, land, and, privileges, in, the, name, of, the, figurehead, king, charles, s, father, pepin, of, herstal, had, united, the, frankish, realm, by, conquering, neustria, and, burgundy, pepin, was, the, first, to, call, himself, duke, and, prince, of, the, franks, a, title, later, taken, up, by, charles, in, december, 714, pepin, of, herstal, died, a, few, months, before, his, death, and, shortly, after, the, murder, of, his, son, grimoald, the, younger, he, had, taken, the, advice, of, his, wife, plectrude, to, designate, as, his, sole, heir, theudoald, his, grandson, by, their, deceased, son, grimoald, this, was, immediately, opposed, by, the, austrasian, nobles, because, theudoald, was, a, child, of, only, eight, years, of, age, to, prevent, charles, using, this, unrest, to, his, own, advantage, plectrude, had, him, imprisoned, in, cologne, the, city, which, was, intended, to, be, her, capital, this, prevented, an, uprising, on, his, behalf, in, austrasia, but, not, in, neustria, pepin, s, death, occasioned, open, conflict, between, his, heirs, and, the, neustrian, nobles, who, sought, political, independence, from, austrasian, control, in, 715, dagobert, iii, named, raganfrid, mayor, of, the, palace, on, 26, september, 715, raganfrid, s, neustrians, met, the, young, theudoald, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, compi, gne, theudoald, was, defeated, and, fled, back, to, cologne, before, the, end, of, the, year, charles, had, escaped, from, prison, and, been, acclaimed, mayor, by, the, nobles, of, austrasia, that, same, year, dagobert, iii, died, and, the, neustrians, proclaimed, chilperic, ii, the, cloistered, son, of, childeric, ii, as, king, in, 716, chilperic, and, raganfrid, together, led, an, army, into, austrasia, intent, on, seizing, the, pippinid, wealth, at, cologne, the, neustrians, allied, with, another, invading, force, under, redbad, king, of, the, frisians, and, met, charles, in, battle, near, cologne, which, was, still, held, by, plectrude, charles, had, little, time, to, gather, men, or, prepare, and, the, result, was, inevitable, the, frisians, held, off, charles, while, the, king, and, his, mayor, besieged, plectrude, at, cologne, where, she, bought, them, off, with, a, substantial, portion, of, pepin, s, treasure, after, that, they, withdrew, the, battle, of, cologne, is, the, only, defeat, of, charles, s, career, charles, retreated, to, the, hills, of, the, eifel, to, gather, and, train, men, in, april, 716, he, fell, upon, the, triumphant, army, near, malmedy, as, it, was, returning, to, neustria, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, ambl, ve, charles, attacked, as, the, enemy, rested, at, midday, according, to, one, source, he, split, his, forces, into, several, groups, which, fell, at, them, from, many, sides, another, suggests, that, while, this, was, his, intention, he, then, decided, given, the, enemy, s, unpreparedness, this, was, not, necessary, in, any, event, the, suddenness, of, the, assault, led, them, to, believe, they, were, facing, a, much, larger, host, many, of, the, enemy, fled, and, charles, s, troops, gathered, the, spoils, of, the, camp, his, reputation, increased, considerably, as, a, result, and, he, attracted, more, followers, this, battle, is, often, considered, by, historians, as, the, turning, point, in, charles, s, struggle, richard, gerberding, points, out, that, up, to, this, time, much, of, charles, s, support, was, probably, from, his, mother, s, kindred, in, the, lands, around, liege, after, ambl, ve, he, seems, to, have, won, the, backing, of, the, influential, willibrord, founder, of, the, abbey, of, echternach, the, abbey, had, been, built, on, land, donated, by, plectrude, s, mother, irmina, of, oeren, but, most, of, willibrord, s, missionary, work, had, been, carried, out, in, frisia, in, joining, chilperic, and, ragqnfrid, radbod, of, frisia, sacked, utrecht, burning, churches, and, killing, many, missionaries, willibrord, and, his, monks, were, forced, to, flee, to, echternach, gerberding, suggests, that, willibrord, had, decided, that, the, chances, of, preserving, his, life, s, work, were, better, with, a, successful, field, commander, like, charles, than, with, plectrude, in, cologne, willibrord, subsequently, baptized, charles, s, son, pepin, gerberding, suggests, a, likely, date, of, easter, 716, charles, also, received, support, from, bishop, pepo, of, verdun, charles, took, time, to, rally, more, men, and, prepare, by, the, following, spring, he, had, attracted, enough, support, to, invade, neustria, charles, sent, an, envoy, who, proposed, a, cessation, of, hostilities, if, chilperic, would, recognize, his, rights, as, mayor, of, the, palace, in, austrasia, the, refusal, was, not, unexpected, but, served, to, impress, upon, charles, s, forces, the, unreasonableness, of, the, neustrians, they, met, near, cambrai, at, the, battle, of, vincy, on, 21, march, 717, the, victorious, charles, pursued, the, fleeing, king, and, mayor, to, paris, but, as, he, was, not, yet, prepared, to, hold, the, city, he, turned, back, to, deal, with, plectrude, and, cologne, he, took, the, city, and, dispersed, her, adherents, plectrude, was, allowed, to, retire, to, a, convent, theudoald, lived, to, 741, under, his, uncle, s, protection, upon, this, success, charles, proclaimed, chlothar, iv, king, in, austrasia, in, opposition, to, chilperic, and, deposed, rigobert, archbishop, of, reims, replacing, him, with, milo, a, lifelong, supporter, in, 718, chilperic, responded, to, charles, s, new, ascendancy, by, making, an, alliance, with, odo, the, great, or, eudes, as, he, is, sometimes, known, the, duke, of, aquitaine, who, had, become, independent, during, the, civil, war, in, 715, but, was, again, defeated, at, the, battle, of, soissons, by, charles, chilperic, fled, with, his, ducal, ally, to, the, land, south, of, the, loire, and, raganfrid, fled, to, angers, soon, chlotar, iv, died, and, odo, surrendered, king, chilperic, in, exchange, for, charles, recognizing, his, dukedom, charles, recognized, chilperic, as, king, of, the, franks, in, return, for, legitimate, royal, affirmation, of, his, own, mayoralty, over, all, the, kingdoms, between, 718, and, 732, charles, secured, his, power, through, a, series, of, victories, having, unified, the, franks, under, his, banner, charles, was, determined, to, punish, the, saxons, who, had, invaded, austrasia, therefore, late, in, 718, he, laid, waste, their, country, to, the, banks, of, the, weser, the, lippe, and, the, ruhr, he, defeated, them, in, the, teutoburg, forest, and, thus, secured, the, frankish, border, when, the, frisian, leader, radbod, died, in, 719, charles, seized, west, frisia, without, any, great, resistance, on, the, part, of, the, frisians, who, had, been, subjected, to, the, franks, but, had, rebelled, upon, the, death, of, pippin, when, chilperic, ii, died, in, 721, charles, appointed, as, his, successor, the, son, of, dagobert, iii, theuderic, iv, who, was, still, a, minor, and, who, occupied, the, throne, from, 721, to, 737, charles, was, now, appointing, the, kings, whom, he, supposedly, served, rois, fain, ants, by, the, end, of, his, reign, he, didn, t, appoint, any, at, all, at, this, time, charles, again, marched, against, the, saxons, then, the, neustrians, rebelled, under, raganfrid, who, had, left, the, county, of, anjou, they, were, easily, defeated, in, 724, but, raganfrid, gave, up, his, sons, as, hostages, in, turn, for, keeping, his, county, this, ended, the, civil, wars, of, charles, reign, the, next, six, years, were, devoted, in, their, entirety, to, assuring, frankish, authority, over, the, neighboring, political, groups, between, 720, and, 723, charles, was, fighting, in, bavaria, where, the, agilolfing, dukes, had, gradually, evolved, into, independent, rulers, recently, in, alliance, with, liutprand, the, lombard, he, forced, the, alemanni, to, accompany, him, and, duke, hugbert, submitted, to, frankish, suzerainty, in, 725, he, brought, back, the, agilolfing, princess, swanachild, as, a, second, wife, in, 725, and, 728, he, again, entered, bavaria, but, in, 730, he, marched, against, lantfrid, duke, of, alemannia, who, had, also, become, independent, and, killed, him, in, battle, he, forced, the, alemanni, to, capitulate, to, frankish, suzerainty, and, did, not, appoint, a, successor, to, lantfrid, thus, southern, germany, once, more, became, part, of, the, frankish, kingdom, as, had, northern, germany, during, the, first, years, of, the, reign, in, 731, after, defeating, the, saxons, charles, turned, his, attention, to, the, rival, southern, realm, of, aquitaine, and, crossed, the, loire, breaking, the, treaty, with, duke, odo, the, franks, ransacked, aquitaine, twice, and, captured, bourges, although, odo, retook, it, the, continuations, of, fredegar, allege, that, odo, called, on, assistance, from, the, recently, established, emirate, of, al, andalus, but, there, had, been, arab, raids, into, aquitaine, from, the, 720s, onwards, indeed, the, anonymous, chronicle, of, 754, records, a, victory, for, odo, in, 721, at, the, battle, of, toulouse, while, the, liber, pontificalis, records, that, odo, had, killed, 375, 000, saracens, it, is, more, likely, that, this, invasion, or, raid, took, place, in, revenge, for, odo, s, support, for, a, rebel, berber, leader, named, munnuza, whatever, the, precise, circumstances, were, it, is, clear, that, an, army, under, the, leadership, of, abd, al, rahman, al, ghafiqi, headed, north, and, after, some, minor, engagements, marched, on, the, wealthy, city, of, tours, according, to, british, medieval, historian, paul, fouracre, their, campaign, should, perhaps, be, interpreted, as, a, long, distance, raid, rather, than, the, beginning, of, a, war, they, were, however, defeated, by, the, army, of, charles, at, the, battle, of, tours, known, in, france, as, the, battle, of, poitiers, at, a, location, between, the, french, cities, of, tours, and, poitiers, in, a, victory, described, by, the, continuations, of, fredegar, according, to, the, historian, bernard, bachrach, the, arab, army, mostly, mounted, failed, to, break, through, the, frankish, infantry, news, of, this, battle, spread, and, may, be, recorded, in, bede, s, ecclesiastical, history, book, v, ch, 23, however, it, is, not, given, prominence, in, arabic, sources, from, the, period, despite, his, victory, charles, did, not, gain, full, control, of, aquitaine, and, odo, remained, duke, until, 735, between, his, victory, of, 732, and, 735, charles, reorganized, the, kingdom, of, burgundy, replacing, the, counts, and, dukes, with, his, loyal, supporters, thus, strengthening, his, hold, on, power, he, was, forced, by, the, ventures, of, bubo, duke, of, the, frisians, to, invade, independent, minded, frisia, again, in, 734, in, that, year, he, slew, the, duke, at, the, battle, of, the, boarn, charles, ordered, the, frisian, pagan, shrines, destroyed, and, so, wholly, subjugated, the, populace, that, the, region, was, peaceful, for, twenty, years, after, in, 735, duke, odo, of, aquitaine, died, though, charles, wished, to, rule, the, duchy, directly, and, went, there, to, elicit, the, submission, of, the, aquitanians, the, aristocracy, proclaimed, odo, s, son, hunald, i, of, aquitaine, as, duke, and, charles, and, hunald, eventually, recognised, each, other, s, position, in, 737, at, the, tail, end, of, his, campaigning, in, provence, and, septimania, the, merovingian, king, theuderic, iv, died, charles, titling, himself, maior, domus, and, princeps, et, dux, francorum, did, not, appoint, a, new, king, and, nobody, acclaimed, one, the, throne, lay, vacant, until, charles, death, the, interregnum, the, final, four, years, of, charles, life, was, relatively, peaceful, although, in, 738, he, compelled, the, saxons, of, westphalia, to, submit, and, pay, tribute, and, in, 739, he, checked, an, uprising, in, provence, where, some, rebels, united, under, the, leadership, of, maurontus, charles, used, the, relative, peace, to, set, about, integrating, the, outlying, realms, of, his, empire, into, the, frankish, church, he, erected, four, dioceses, in, bavaria, salzburg, regensburg, freising, and, passau, and, gave, them, boniface, as, archbishop, and, metropolitan, over, all, germany, east, of, the, rhine, with, his, seat, at, mainz, boniface, had, been, under, his, protection, from, 723, on, indeed, the, saint, himself, explained, to, his, old, friend, daniel, of, winchester, that, without, it, he, could, neither, administer, his, church, defend, his, clergy, nor, prevent, idolatry, in, 739, pope, gregory, iii, begged, charles, for, his, aid, against, liutprand, but, charles, was, loath, to, fight, his, onetime, ally, and, ignored, the, plea, nonetheless, the, pope, s, request, for, frankish, protection, showed, how, far, charles, had, come, from, the, days, when, he, was, tottering, on, excommunication, and, set, the, stage, for, his, son, and, grandson, to, assert, themselves, in, the, peninsula, charles, died, on, 22, october, 741, at, quierzy, sur, oise, in, what, is, today, the, aisne, d, partement, in, the, picardy, region, of, france, he, was, buried, at, saint, denis, basilica, in, paris, his, territories, had, been, divided, among, his, adult, sons, a, year, earlier, to, carloman, he, gave, austrasia, alemannia, and, thuringia, and, to, pippin, the, younger, neustria, burgundy, provence, and, metz, and, trier, in, the, mosel, duchy, grifo, was, given, several, lands, throughout, the, kingdom, but, at, a, later, date, just, before, charles, died, 50, earlier, in, his, life, charles, had, many, internal, opponents, and, felt, the, need, to, appoint, his, own, kingly, claimant, chlotar, iv, later, however, the, dynamics, of, rulership, in, francia, had, changed, and, no, hallowed, merovingian, ruler, was, required, charles, divided, his, realm, among, his, sons, without, opposition, though, he, ignored, his, young, son, bernard, for, many, historians, charles, laid, the, foundations, for, his, son, pepin, s, rise, to, the, frankish, throne, in, 751, and, his, grandson, charlemagne, s, imperial, acclamation, in, 800, however, for, paul, fouracre, while, charles, was, the, most, effective, military, leader, in, francia, his, career, finished, on, a, note, of, unfinished, business, charles, married, twice, his, first, wife, being, rotrude, of, treves, daughter, either, of, lambert, ii, count, of, hesbaye, or, of, leudwinus, count, of, treves, they, had, the, following, children, most, of, the, children, married, and, had, issue, hiltrud, married, odilo, i, duke, of, bavaria, landrade, was, once, believed, to, have, married, a, sigrand, count, of, hesbania, but, sigrand, s, wife, was, more, likely, the, sister, of, rotrude, auda, married, theoderic, count, of, autun, charles, also, married, a, second, time, to, swanhild, and, they, had, a, child, named, grifo, 50, with, ruodhaid, with, whom, he, had, for, early, medieval, authors, charles, was, famous, for, his, military, victories, paul, the, deacon, for, instance, attributed, a, victory, against, the, saracens, actually, won, by, odo, of, aquitaine, to, charles, however, alongside, this, there, soon, developed, a, darker, reputation, for, his, alleged, abuse, of, church, property, a, ninth, century, text, the, visio, eucherii, possibly, written, by, hincmar, of, reims, portrayed, charles, as, suffering, in, hell, for, this, reason, according, to, british, medieval, historian, paul, fouracre, this, was, the, single, most, important, text, in, the, construction, of, charles, s, reputation, as, a, seculariser, or, despoiler, of, church, lands, by, the, eighteenth, century, historians, such, as, edward, gibbon, had, begun, to, portray, the, frankish, leader, as, the, saviour, of, christian, europe, from, a, full, scale, islamic, invasion, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, german, historian, heinrich, brunner, argued, that, charles, had, confiscated, church, lands, in, order, to, fund, military, reforms, that, allowed, him, to, defeat, the, arab, conquests, in, this, way, brilliantly, combining, two, traditions, about, the, ruler, however, fouracre, argued, that, there, is, not, enough, evidence, to, show, that, there, was, a, decisive, change, either, in, the, way, in, which, the, franks, fought, or, in, the, way, in, which, they, organised, the, resources, needed, to, support, their, warriors, many, twentieth, century, european, historians, continued, to, develop, gibbon, s, perspectives, such, as, french, medievalist, christian, pfister, who, wrote, in, 1911, that, besides, establishing, a, certain, unity, in, gaul, charles, saved, it, from, a, great, peril, in, 711, the, arabs, had, conquered, spain, in, 720, they, crossed, the, pyrenees, seized, narbonensis, a, dependency, of, the, kingdom, of, the, visigoths, and, advanced, on, gaul, by, his, able, policy, odo, succeeded, in, arresting, their, progress, for, some, years, but, a, new, vali, abdur, rahman, a, member, of, an, extremely, fanatical, sect, resumed, the, attack, reached, poitiers, and, advanced, on, tours, the, holy, town, of, gaul, in, october, 732, just, 100, years, after, the, death, of, mahomet, charles, gained, a, brilliant, victory, over, abdur, rahman, who, was, called, back, to, africa, by, revolts, of, the, berbers, and, had, to, give, up, the, struggle, after, his, victory, charles, took, the, offensive, similarly, william, e, watson, who, wrote, of, the, battle, s, importance, in, frankish, and, world, history, in, 1993, suggested, that, had, charles, martel, suffered, at, tours, poitiers, the, fate, of, king, roderick, at, the, rio, barbate, it, is, doubtful, that, a, do, nothing, sovereign, of, the, merovingian, realm, could, have, later, succeeded, where, his, talented, major, domus, had, failed, indeed, as, charles, was, the, progenitor, of, the, carolingian, line, of, frankish, rulers, and, grandfather, of, charlemagne, one, can, even, say, with, a, degree, of, certainty, that, the, subsequent, history, of, the, west, would, have, proceeded, along, vastly, different, currents, had, abd, al, rahman, been, victorious, at, tours, poitiers, in, 732, and, in, 1993, the, influential, political, scientist, samuel, huntington, saw, the, battle, of, tours, as, marking, the, end, of, the, arab, and, moorish, surge, west, and, north, other, recent, historians, however, argue, that, the, importance, of, the, battle, is, dramatically, overstated, both, for, european, history, in, general, and, for, charles, s, reign, in, particular, this, view, is, typified, by, alessandro, barbero, who, in, 2004, wrote, today, historians, tend, to, play, down, the, significance, of, the, battle, of, poitiers, pointing, out, that, the, purpose, of, the, arab, force, defeated, by, charles, martel, was, not, to, conquer, the, frankish, kingdom, but, simply, to, pillage, the, wealthy, monastery, of, st, martin, of, tours, similarly, in, 2002, toma, mastnak, wrote, the, continuators, of, fredegar, s, chronicle, who, probably, wrote, in, the, mid, eighth, century, pictured, the, battle, as, just, one, of, many, military, encounters, between, christians, and, saracens, moreover, as, only, one, in, a, series, of, wars, fought, by, frankish, princes, for, booty, and, territory, one, of, fredegar, s, continuators, presented, the, battle, of, poitiers, as, what, it, really, was, an, episode, in, the, struggle, between, christian, princes, as, the, carolingians, strove, to, bring, aquitaine, under, their, rule, more, recently, the, memory, of, charles, has, been, appropriated, by, far, right, and, white, nationalist, groups, such, as, the, charles, martel, group, in, france, and, by, the, perpetrator, of, the, christchurch, mosque, shootings, at, al, noor, mosque, and, linwood, islamic, centre, in, christchurch, new, zealand, in, 2019, the, memory, of, charles, is, a, topic, of, debate, in, contemporary, french, politics, on, both, the, right, and, the, left, in, the, seventeenth, century, a, legend, emerged, that, charles, had, formed, the, first, regular, order, of, knights, in, france, in, 1620, andre, favyn, stated, without, providing, a, source, that, among, the, spoils, charles, s, forces, captured, after, the, battle, of, tours, were, many, genets, raised, for, their, fur, and, several, of, their, pelts, charles, gave, these, furs, to, leaders, amongst, his, army, forming, the, first, order, of, knighthood, the, order, of, the, genet, favyn, s, claim, was, then, repeated, and, elaborated, in, later, works, in, english, for, instance, by, elias, ashmole, in, 1672, and, james, coats, in, 1725
