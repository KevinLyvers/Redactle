tycho, brahe, t, a, k, o, b, r, h, i, b, r, h, ty, koh, brah, h, ee, brah, h, danish, born, tyge, ottesen, brahe, danish, 14, december, 1546, 24, october, 1601, generally, called, tycho, for, short, was, a, danish, astronomer, of, the, renaissance, known, for, his, comprehensive, and, unprecedentedly, accurate, astronomical, observations, he, was, known, during, his, lifetime, as, an, astronomer, astrologer, and, alchemist, he, was, the, last, major, astronomer, before, the, invention, of, the, telescope, tycho, brahe, has, also, been, described, as, the, greatest, pre, telescopic, astronomer, in, 1572, tycho, noticed, a, completely, new, star, that, was, brighter, than, any, star, or, planet, astonished, by, the, existence, of, a, star, that, ought, not, to, have, been, there, he, devoted, himself, to, the, creation, of, ever, more, accurate, instruments, of, measurement, over, the, next, fifteen, years, 1576, 1591, king, frederick, ii, granted, tycho, an, estate, on, the, island, of, hven, and, the, money, to, build, uraniborg, the, first, large, observatory, in, christian, europe, he, later, worked, underground, at, stjerneborg, where, he, realised, that, his, instruments, in, uraniborg, were, not, sufficiently, steady, his, unprecedented, research, program, both, turned, astronomy, into, the, first, modern, science, and, also, helped, launch, the, scientific, revolution, an, heir, to, several, noble, families, tycho, was, well, educated, he, worked, to, combine, what, he, saw, as, the, geometrical, benefits, of, copernican, heliocentrism, with, the, philosophical, benefits, of, the, ptolemaic, system, and, devised, the, tychonic, system, his, own, version, of, a, model, of, the, universe, with, the, sun, orbiting, the, earth, and, the, planets, as, orbiting, the, sun, in, de, nova, stella, 1573, he, refuted, the, aristotelian, belief, in, an, unchanging, celestial, realm, his, measurements, indicated, that, new, stars, stellae, novae, now, called, supernovae, moved, beyond, the, moon, and, he, was, able, to, show, that, comets, were, not, atmospheric, phenomena, as, was, previously, thought, in, 1597, tycho, was, forced, by, the, new, king, christian, iv, to, leave, denmark, he, was, invited, to, prague, where, he, became, the, official, imperial, astronomer, and, built, an, observatory, at, ben, tky, nad, jizerou, prior, to, his, death, in, 1601, he, was, assisted, for, a, year, by, johannes, kepler, who, went, on, to, use, tycho, s, data, to, develop, his, own, three, laws, of, planetary, motion, tycho, brahe, was, born, as, heir, to, several, of, denmark, s, most, influential, noble, families, in, addition, to, his, immediate, ancestry, with, the, brahe, and, the, bille, families, he, counted, the, rud, trolle, ulfstand, and, rosenkrantz, families, among, his, ancestors, both, of, his, grandfathers, and, all, of, his, great, grandfathers, had, served, as, members, of, the, danish, king, s, privy, council, his, paternal, grandfather, and, namesake, thyge, brahe, was, the, lord, of, tosterup, castle, in, scania, and, died, in, battle, during, the, 1523, siege, of, malm, during, the, lutheran, reformation, wars, his, maternal, grandfather, claus, bille, lord, to, bohus, castle, and, a, second, cousin, of, swedish, king, gustav, vasa, participated, in, the, stockholm, bloodbath, on, the, side, of, the, danish, king, against, the, swedish, nobles, tycho, s, father, otte, brahe, a, royal, privy, councilor, like, his, own, father, married, beate, bille, a, powerful, figure, at, the, danish, court, holding, several, royal, land, titles, tycho, s, parents, are, buried, under, the, floor, of, the, church, of, k, ger, d, four, kilometres, east, of, knutstorp, castle, tycho, was, born, on, 14, december, 1546, at, his, family, s, ancestral, seat, at, knutstorp, knudstrup, borg, knutstorps, borg, about, 8, kilometres, 5, 0, mi, north, of, sval, v, in, then, danish, scania, he, was, the, oldest, of, 12, siblings, 8, of, whom, lived, to, adulthood, including, steen, brahe, and, sophia, brahe, his, twin, brother, died, before, being, baptized, tycho, later, wrote, an, ode, in, latin, to, his, dead, twin, which, was, printed, in, 1572, as, his, first, published, work, an, epitaph, originally, from, knutstorp, but, now, on, a, plaque, near, the, church, door, shows, the, whole, family, including, tycho, as, a, boy, when, he, was, only, two, years, old, tycho, was, taken, away, to, be, raised, by, his, uncle, j, rgen, thygesen, brahe, and, his, wife, inger, oxe, sister, to, peder, oxe, steward, of, the, realm, who, were, childless, it, is, unclear, why, otte, brahe, reached, this, arrangement, with, his, brother, but, tycho, was, the, only, one, of, his, siblings, not, to, be, raised, by, his, mother, at, knutstorp, instead, tycho, was, raised, at, j, rgen, brahe, s, estate, at, tosterup, and, at, tranek, r, on, the, island, of, langeland, and, later, at, n, sbyhoved, castle, near, odense, and, later, again, at, the, castle, of, nyk, bing, on, the, island, of, falster, tycho, later, wrote, that, j, rgen, brahe, raised, me, and, generously, provided, for, me, during, his, life, until, my, eighteenth, year, he, always, treated, me, as, his, own, son, and, made, me, his, heir, from, ages, 6, to, 12, tycho, attended, latin, school, probably, in, nyk, bing, at, age, 12, on, 19, april, 1559, tycho, began, studies, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, there, following, his, uncle, s, wishes, he, studied, law, but, also, studied, a, variety, of, other, subjects, and, became, interested, in, astronomy, at, the, university, aristotle, was, a, staple, of, scientific, theory, and, tycho, likely, received, a, thorough, training, in, aristotelian, physics, and, cosmology, he, experienced, the, solar, eclipse, of, 21, august, 1560, and, was, greatly, impressed, by, the, fact, that, it, had, been, predicted, although, the, prediction, based, on, current, observational, data, was, a, day, off, he, realized, that, more, accurate, observations, would, be, the, key, to, making, more, exact, predictions, he, purchased, an, ephemeris, and, books, on, astronomy, including, johannes, de, sacrobosco, s, de, sphaera, mundi, petrus, apianus, s, cosmographia, seu, descriptio, totius, orbis, and, regiomontanus, s, de, triangulis, omnimodis, j, rgen, thygesen, brahe, however, wanted, tycho, to, educate, himself, in, order, to, become, a, civil, servant, and, sent, him, on, a, study, tour, of, europe, in, early, 1562, 15, year, old, tycho, was, given, as, mentor, the, 19, year, old, anders, s, rensen, vedel, whom, he, eventually, talked, into, allowing, the, pursuit, of, astronomy, during, the, tour, vedel, and, his, pupil, left, copenhagen, in, february, 1562, on, 24, march, they, arrived, in, leipzig, where, they, matriculated, at, the, lutheran, leipzig, university, in, 1563, he, observed, a, close, conjunction, of, the, planets, jupiter, and, saturn, and, noticed, that, the, copernican, and, ptolemaic, tables, used, to, predict, the, conjunction, were, inaccurate, this, led, him, to, realise, that, progress, in, astronomy, required, systematic, rigorous, observation, night, after, night, using, the, most, accurate, instruments, obtainable, he, began, maintaining, detailed, journals, of, all, his, astronomical, observations, in, this, period, he, combined, the, study, of, astronomy, with, astrology, laying, down, horoscopes, for, different, famous, personalities, when, tycho, and, vedel, returned, from, leipzig, in, 1565, denmark, was, at, war, with, sweden, and, as, vice, admiral, of, the, danish, fleet, j, rgen, brahe, had, become, a, national, hero, for, having, participated, in, the, sinking, of, the, swedish, warship, mars, during, the, first, battle, of, land, 1564, shortly, after, tycho, s, arrival, in, denmark, j, rgen, brahe, was, defeated, in, the, action, of, 4, june, 1565, and, shortly, afterwards, died, of, a, fever, stories, have, it, that, he, contracted, pneumonia, after, a, night, of, drinking, with, the, danish, king, frederick, ii, when, the, king, fell, into, the, water, in, a, copenhagen, canal, and, brahe, jumped, in, after, him, brahe, s, possessions, passed, on, to, his, wife, inger, oxe, who, considered, tycho, with, special, fondness, in, 1566, tycho, left, to, study, at, the, university, of, rostock, there, he, studied, with, professors, of, medicine, at, the, university, s, famous, medical, school, and, became, interested, in, medical, alchemy, and, herbal, medicine, on, 29, december, 1566, at, the, age, of, 20, tycho, lost, part, of, his, nose, in, a, sword, duel, with, a, fellow, danish, nobleman, his, third, cousin, manderup, parsberg, the, two, had, drunkenly, quarreled, over, who, was, the, superior, mathematician, at, an, engagement, party, at, the, home, of, professor, lucas, bachmeister, on, 10, december, on, 29, december, the, cousins, resolved, their, feud, with, a, duel, in, the, dark, though, the, two, were, later, reconciled, in, the, duel, tycho, lost, the, bridge, of, his, nose, and, gained, a, broad, scar, across, his, forehead, he, received, the, best, possible, care, at, the, university, and, wore, a, prosthetic, nose, for, the, rest, of, his, life, it, was, kept, in, place, with, paste, or, glue, and, said, to, be, made, of, silver, and, gold, in, november, 2012, danish, and, czech, researchers, reported, that, the, prosthesis, was, actually, made, of, brass, after, chemically, analyzing, a, small, bone, sample, from, the, nose, from, the, body, exhumed, in, 2010, the, prostheses, made, of, gold, and, silver, were, mostly, worn, for, special, occasions, rather, than, everyday, wear, in, april, 1567, tycho, returned, home, from, his, travels, with, a, firm, intention, of, becoming, an, astrologer, although, he, had, been, expected, to, go, into, politics, and, the, law, like, most, of, his, kinsmen, and, although, denmark, was, still, at, war, with, sweden, his, family, supported, his, decision, to, dedicate, himself, to, the, sciences, his, father, wanted, him, to, take, up, law, but, tycho, was, allowed, to, travel, to, rostock, and, then, to, augsburg, where, he, built, a, great, quadrant, then, basel, and, freiburg, in, 1568, he, was, appointed, a, canon, at, roskilde, cathedral, a, largely, honorary, position, that, allowed, him, to, focus, on, his, studies, at, the, end, of, 1570, he, was, informed, of, his, father, s, ill, health, so, he, returned, to, knutstorp, castle, where, his, father, died, on, 9, may, 1571, the, war, was, over, and, the, danish, lords, soon, returned, to, prosperity, soon, another, uncle, steen, bille, helped, him, build, an, observatory, and, alchemical, laboratory, at, herrevad, abbey, where, tycho, was, assisted, by, his, keenest, disciple, his, younger, sister, sophie, brahe, tycho, was, acknowledged, by, king, frederick, ii, who, proposed, to, him, that, an, observatory, be, built, to, better, study, the, night, sky, after, accepting, this, proposal, the, location, for, the, uraniborg, s, construction, was, set, on, an, island, called, hven, now, ven, in, the, sound, not, too, far, from, copenhagen, the, earliest, large, observatory, in, christian, europe, tycho, brahe, was, highly, appreciated, by, king, frederick, ii, and, he, was, accepted, and, supported, by, people, of, high, social, status, he, was, supported, by, the, church, the, support, tycho, brahe, received, from, the, king, allowed, him, to, continue, his, research, and, make, significant, contributions, to, the, field, of, astronomy, in, the, late, 16th, century, tycho, brahe, built, an, observatory, called, uraniborg, it, was, built, on, the, island, of, hven, located, between, the, provinces, of, zealand, sj, lland, and, scania, sk, ne, the, island, was, then, an, administrative, part, of, zealand, later, after, the, peace, of, roskilde, in, 1658, scania, was, conquered, by, the, swedes, in, 1660, hven, became, part, of, sweden, in, tycho, s, time, it, was, all, denmark, he, lived, on, hven, for, approximately, 21, years, he, began, to, build, uraniborg, in, 1576, and, moved, there, soon, after, as, uraniborg, was, a, significant, and, advanced, observatory, it, took, years, to, complete, uraniborg, was, a, place, where, tycho, brahe, could, research, and, analyze, his, previous, findings, as, well, as, explore, new, discoveries, tycho, brahe, was, an, astronomer, of, the, pre, telescope, era, using, just, his, naked, eye, he, observed, the, planets, moon, stars, and, space, and, recorded, everything, he, saw, while, completing, a, multitude, of, calculations, daily, the, location, of, uraniborg, was, strategically, chosen, with, seclusion, and, support, being, the, primary, reasons, for, building, on, the, island, of, hven, seclusion, was, essential, for, accurate, observation, and, gave, tycho, brahe, a, better, way, to, focus, on, his, work, without, worrying, about, interruptions, from, other, people, seclusion, was, also, important, for, observation, as, there, was, nothing, interfering, with, time, light, or, motion, observations, tycho, brahe, was, a, perfectionist, and, by, being, secluded, he, had, complete, control, over, his, research, and, was, not, limited, by, anyone, else, s, restrictions, enabling, him, to, develop, innovative, research, he, could, focus, all, of, his, energy, on, his, work, without, receiving, any, backlash, or, questioning, from, anyone, the, seclusion, gave, him, the, freedom, to, pursue, his, research, without, limitations, and, paved, the, way, for, groundbreaking, discoveries, in, the, field, of, astronomy, uraniborg, was, one, of, the, most, advanced, observatories, of, its, time, equipped, with, several, astronomical, instruments, including, quadrant, instruments, sextants, and, astronomical, clocks, tycho, brahe, s, observations, and, calculations, at, uraniborg, allowed, him, to, develop, more, accurate, solar, system, models, he, compiled, the, most, extensive, and, accurate, catalog, of, stellar, positions, up, to, that, time, tycho, brahe, s, observations, and, calculations, at, uraniborg, allowed, him, to, lay, the, groundwork, for, astronomers, in, the, future, despite, the, success, tycho, brahe, had, on, hven, he, eventually, left, the, island, after, a, disagreement, with, the, new, king, of, denmark, christian, iv, in, 1597, tycho, brahe, moved, to, prague, where, he, continued, his, work, and, was, eventually, appointed, by, emperor, rudolf, ii, in, 1601, as, imperial, mathematician, however, uraniborg, remained, a, significant, landmark, in, the, history, of, astronomy, towards, the, end, of, 1571, tycho, fell, in, love, with, kirsten, daughter, of, j, rgen, hansen, the, lutheran, minister, in, knudstrup, as, she, was, a, commoner, tycho, never, formally, married, her, since, if, he, did, he, would, lose, his, noble, privileges, however, danish, law, permitted, morganatic, marriage, which, meant, that, a, nobleman, and, a, common, woman, could, live, together, openly, as, husband, and, wife, for, three, years, and, their, alliance, then, became, a, legally, binding, marriage, however, each, would, maintain, their, social, status, and, any, children, they, had, together, would, be, considered, commoners, with, no, rights, to, titles, landholdings, coat, of, arms, or, even, their, father, s, noble, name, while, king, frederick, respected, tycho, s, choice, of, wife, himself, having, been, unable, to, marry, the, woman, he, loved, many, of, tycho, s, family, members, disagreed, and, many, churchmen, continued, to, hold, the, lack, of, a, divinely, sanctioned, marriage, against, him, kirsten, j, rgensdatter, gave, birth, to, their, first, daughter, kirstine, named, after, tycho, s, late, sister, on, 12, october, 1573, kirstine, died, from, the, plague, in, 1576, tycho, wrote, a, heartfelt, elegy, for, her, tombstone, in, 1574, they, moved, to, copenhagen, where, their, daughter, magdalene, was, born, later, the, family, followed, him, into, exile, kirsten, and, tycho, lived, together, for, almost, thirty, years, until, tycho, s, death, together, they, had, eight, children, six, of, whom, lived, to, adulthood, on, 11, november, 1572, tycho, observed, from, herrevad, abbey, a, very, bright, star, now, numbered, sn, 1572, which, had, unexpectedly, appeared, in, the, constellation, cassiopeia, because, it, had, been, maintained, since, antiquity, that, the, world, beyond, the, moon, s, orbit, was, eternally, unchangeable, with, celestial, immutability, being, a, fundamental, axiom, of, the, aristotelian, world, view, other, observers, held, that, the, phenomenon, was, something, in, the, terrestrial, sphere, below, the, moon, however, tycho, observed, that, the, object, showed, no, daily, parallax, against, the, background, of, the, fixed, stars, this, implied, that, it, was, at, least, farther, away, than, the, moon, and, those, planets, that, do, show, such, parallax, he, found, that, the, object, did, not, change, its, position, relative, to, the, fixed, stars, over, several, months, as, all, planets, did, in, their, periodic, orbital, motions, even, the, outer, planets, for, which, no, daily, parallax, was, detectable, this, suggested, that, it, was, not, even, a, planet, but, a, fixed, star, in, the, stellar, sphere, beyond, all, the, planets, in, 1573, he, published, a, small, book, de, nova, stella, coining, the, term, nova, for, a, new, star, we, now, classify, this, star, as, a, supernova, and, know, that, it, is, 7, 500, light, years, from, earth, this, discovery, was, decisive, for, his, choice, of, astronomy, as, a, profession, tycho, was, strongly, critical, of, those, who, dismissed, the, implications, of, the, astronomical, appearance, writing, in, the, preface, to, de, nova, stella, o, crassa, ingenia, o, caecos, coeli, spectatores, o, thick, wits, o, blind, watchers, of, the, sky, the, publication, of, his, discovery, made, him, a, well, known, name, among, scientists, in, europe, tycho, continued, with, his, detailed, observations, often, assisted, by, his, first, assistant, and, student, his, younger, sister, sophie, in, 1574, tycho, published, the, observations, made, in, 1572, from, his, first, observatory, at, herrevad, abbey, he, then, started, lecturing, on, astronomy, but, gave, it, up, and, left, denmark, in, spring, 1575, to, tour, abroad, he, first, visited, william, iv, landgrave, of, hesse, kassel, s, observatory, at, kassel, then, went, on, to, frankfurt, basel, and, venice, where, he, acted, as, an, agent, for, the, danish, king, contacting, artisans, and, craftsmen, whom, the, king, wanted, to, work, on, his, new, palace, at, elsinore, upon, his, return, the, king, wished, to, repay, tycho, s, service, by, offering, him, a, position, worthy, of, his, family, he, offered, him, a, choice, of, lordships, of, militarily, and, economically, important, estates, such, as, the, castles, of, hammershus, or, helsingborg, tycho, was, reluctant, to, take, up, a, position, as, a, lord, of, the, realm, preferring, to, focus, on, his, science, he, wrote, to, his, friend, johannes, pratensis, i, did, not, want, to, take, possession, of, any, of, the, castles, our, benevolent, king, so, graciously, offered, me, i, am, displeased, with, society, here, customary, forms, and, the, whole, rubbish, tycho, secretly, began, to, plan, to, move, to, basel, wishing, to, participate, in, the, burgeoning, academic, and, scientific, life, there, the, king, heard, of, tycho, s, plans, and, desiring, to, keep, the, distinguished, scientist, in, 1576, he, offered, tycho, the, island, of, hven, in, resund, and, funding, to, set, up, an, observatory, until, then, hven, had, been, property, directly, under, the, crown, the, 50, families, on, the, island, considered, themselves, to, be, freeholding, farmers, but, with, tycho, s, appointment, as, feudal, lord, of, hven, this, changed, tycho, took, control, of, agricultural, planning, requiring, the, peasants, to, cultivate, twice, as, much, as, they, had, done, before, and, he, exacted, corv, e, labor, from, the, peasants, for, the, construction, of, his, new, castle, the, peasants, complained, about, tycho, s, excessive, taxation, and, took, him, to, court, the, court, established, tycho, s, right, to, levy, taxes, and, labor, the, result, was, a, contract, detailing, the, mutual, obligations, of, lord, and, peasants, on, the, island, tycho, envisioned, his, castle, uraniborg, as, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, muses, of, arts, and, sciences, rather, than, as, a, military, fortress, it, was, named, after, urania, the, muse, of, astronomy, construction, began, in, 1576, with, a, laboratory, for, his, alchemical, experiments, in, the, cellar, uraniborg, was, inspired, by, the, venetian, architect, andrea, palladio, it, was, one, of, the, first, buildings, in, northern, europe, to, show, influence, from, italian, renaissance, architecture, when, he, realized, that, the, towers, of, uraniborg, were, not, adequate, as, observatories, because, of, the, instruments, exposure, to, the, elements, and, the, movement, of, the, building, he, constructed, an, underground, observatory, close, to, uraniborg, called, stjerneborg, star, castle, in, 1584, this, consisted, of, several, hemispherical, crypts, which, contained, the, great, equatorial, armillary, large, azimuth, quadrant, zodiacal, armillary, largest, azimuth, quadrant, of, steel, and, the, trigonal, sextant, the, basement, of, uraniborg, included, an, alchemical, laboratory, with, 16, furnaces, for, conducting, distillations, and, other, chemical, experiments, unusually, for, the, time, tycho, established, uraniborg, as, a, research, centre, where, almost, 100, students, and, artisans, worked, from, 1576, to, 1597, uraniborg, contained, a, printing, press, and, a, paper, mill, both, among, the, first, in, scandinavia, enabling, tycho, to, publish, his, own, manuscripts, on, locally, made, paper, with, his, own, watermark, he, created, a, system, of, ponds, and, canals, to, run, the, wheels, of, the, paper, mill, another, resident, of, uraniborg, was, a, man, with, dwarfism, named, jeppe, whom, tycho, believed, had, the, ability, to, predict, the, future, and, he, allegedly, was, able, to, correctly, predict, the, chances, of, recovery, or, death, of, ill, people, in, hven, over, the, years, he, worked, on, uraniborg, tycho, was, assisted, by, a, number, of, students, and, proteg, s, many, of, whom, went, on, to, their, own, careers, in, astronomy, among, them, were, christian, s, rensen, longomontanus, later, one, of, the, main, proponents, of, the, tychonic, model, and, tycho, s, replacement, as, royal, danish, astronomer, peder, fleml, se, elias, olsen, morsing, and, cort, aslakss, n, tycho, s, instrument, maker, hans, crol, formed, part, of, the, scientific, community, on, the, island, tycho, observed, the, great, comet, that, was, visible, in, the, northern, sky, from, november, 1577, to, january, 1578, within, lutheranism, it, was, commonly, believed, that, celestial, objects, like, comets, were, powerful, portents, announcing, the, coming, apocalypse, several, danish, amateur, astronomers, observed, the, object, and, published, prophesies, of, impending, doom, tycho, was, able, to, determine, that, the, comet, s, distance, to, earth, was, much, greater, than, the, distance, of, the, moon, so, that, the, comet, could, not, have, originated, in, the, earthly, sphere, confirming, his, prior, anti, aristotelian, conclusions, about, the, fixed, nature, of, the, sky, beyond, the, moon, tycho, realized, that, the, comet, s, tail, was, always, pointing, away, from, the, sun, he, calculated, its, diameter, mass, and, the, length, of, its, tail, and, speculated, about, the, material, it, was, made, of, through, nightly, observations, of, the, comet, tycho, brahe, estimated, its, closest, approach, to, earth, at, about, 230, times, the, earth, s, radius, he, also, analyzed, its, motion, suggesting, an, orbit, located, between, mercury, and, venus, at, this, point, he, had, not, yet, broken, with, copernican, heliocentrism, and, observing, the, comet, inspired, him, to, try, to, develop, an, alternative, copernican, model, in, which, the, earth, was, immobile, tycho, brahe, s, comet, observations, challenged, the, prevailing, theory, of, solid, celestial, spheres, with, the, comet, likely, traveling, between, mercury, and, venus, the, notion, of, these, rigid, spheres, became, untenable, it, suggested, a, vast, emptiness, where, objects, like, the, comet, potentially, quite, large, could, move, freely, and, exhibit, properties, unlike, those, previously, understood, the, second, half, of, his, manuscript, about, the, comet, dealt, with, the, astrological, and, apocalyptic, aspects, of, the, comet, tycho, rejected, the, prophesies, of, his, competitors, instead, he, made, his, own, predictions, of, dire, political, events, in, the, near, future, among, his, predictions, was, bloodshed, in, moscow, and, the, imminent, fall, of, ivan, the, terrible, by, 1583, the, support, that, tycho, received, from, the, crown, was, substantial, amounting, to, 1, of, the, annual, total, revenue, at, one, point, in, the, 1580s, tycho, often, held, large, social, gatherings, in, his, castle, pierre, gassendi, wrote, that, tycho, had, a, tame, elk, and, that, his, mentor, the, landgrave, wilhelm, of, hesse, kassel, asked, whether, there, was, an, animal, faster, than, a, deer, tycho, replied, that, there, was, none, but, he, could, send, his, tame, elk, when, wilhelm, replied, he, would, accept, one, in, exchange, for, a, horse, tycho, replied, with, the, sad, news, that, the, elk, had, just, died, on, a, visit, to, entertain, a, nobleman, at, landskrona, apparently, during, dinner, the, elk, had, drunk, a, lot, of, beer, fallen, down, the, stairs, and, died, among, the, many, noble, visitors, to, hven, was, james, vi, of, scotland, who, married, the, danish, princess, anne, after, his, visit, to, hven, in, 1590, he, wrote, a, poem, comparing, tycho, with, apollon, and, phaethon, as, part, of, tycho, s, duties, to, the, crown, in, exchange, for, his, estate, he, fulfilled, the, functions, of, a, royal, astrologer, at, the, beginning, of, each, year, he, had, to, present, an, almanac, to, the, court, predicting, the, influence, of, the, stars, on, the, political, and, economic, prospects, of, the, year, at, the, birth, of, each, prince, he, prepared, their, horoscopes, predicting, their, fates, he, also, worked, as, a, cartographer, with, his, former, tutor, anders, s, rensen, vedel, on, mapping, out, all, of, the, danish, realm, an, ally, of, the, king, and, friendly, with, queen, sophie, both, his, mother, beate, bille, and, adoptive, mother, inger, oxe, had, been, her, court, maids, he, secured, a, promise, from, the, king, that, ownership, of, hven, and, uraniborg, would, pass, to, his, heirs, in, 1588, tycho, s, royal, benefactor, died, and, a, volume, of, tycho, s, great, two, volume, work, astronomiae, instauratae, progymnasmata, introduction, to, the, new, astronomy, was, published, the, first, volume, devoted, to, the, new, star, of, 1572, was, not, ready, because, the, reduction, of, the, observations, of, 1572, 73, involved, much, research, to, correct, the, stars, positions, for, refraction, precession, the, motion, of, the, sun, etc, and, was, not, completed, in, tycho, s, lifetime, it, was, published, in, prague, in, 1602, 1603, the, second, volume, titled, de, mundi, aetherei, recentioribus, phaenomenis, liber, secundus, second, book, about, recent, phenomena, in, the, celestial, world, and, devoted, to, the, comet, of, 1577, was, printed, at, uraniborg, and, some, copies, were, issued, in, 1588, besides, the, comet, observations, it, included, an, account, of, tycho, s, system, of, the, world, the, third, volume, was, intended, to, treat, the, comets, of, 1580, and, following, years, in, a, similar, manner, it, was, never, published, or, written, though, a, great, deal, of, material, about, the, comet, of, 1585, was, put, together, and, published, in, 1845, with, the, observations, of, this, comet, while, at, uraniborg, tycho, maintained, correspondence, with, scientists, and, astronomers, across, europe, he, inquired, about, other, astronomers, observations, and, shared, his, own, technological, advances, to, help, them, achieve, more, accurate, observations, thus, his, correspondence, was, crucial, to, his, research, often, correspondence, was, not, just, private, communication, between, scholars, but, also, a, way, to, disseminate, results, and, arguments, and, to, build, progress, and, scientific, consensus, through, correspondence, tycho, was, involved, in, several, personal, disputes, with, critics, of, his, theories, prominent, among, them, were, john, craig, a, scottish, physician, who, was, a, strong, believer, in, the, authority, of, the, aristotelian, worldview, and, nicolaus, reimers, baer, known, as, ursus, an, astronomer, at, the, imperial, court, in, prague, whom, tycho, accused, of, having, plagiarized, his, cosmological, model, craig, refused, to, accept, tycho, s, conclusion, that, the, comet, of, 1577, had, to, be, located, within, the, aetherial, sphere, rather, than, within, the, atmosphere, of, earth, craig, tried, to, contradict, tycho, by, using, his, own, observations, of, the, comet, and, by, questioning, his, methodology, tycho, published, an, apologia, a, defense, of, his, conclusions, in, which, he, provided, additional, arguments, as, well, as, condemning, craig, s, ideas, in, strong, language, for, being, incompetent, another, dispute, concerned, the, mathematician, paul, wittich, who, after, staying, on, hven, in, 1580, taught, count, wilhelm, of, kassel, and, his, astronomer, christoph, rothmann, to, build, copies, of, tycho, s, instruments, without, permission, from, tycho, craig, who, had, studied, with, wittich, accused, tycho, of, minimizing, wittich, s, role, in, developing, some, of, the, trigonometric, methods, used, by, tycho, in, his, dealings, with, these, disputes, tycho, made, sure, to, leverage, his, support, in, the, scientific, community, by, publishing, and, disseminating, his, own, answers, and, arguments, denmark, what, is, my, offense, how, have, i, offended, my, fatherland, you, may, think, that, what, i, have, done, is, wrong, but, was, i, wrong, to, spread, your, fame, abroad, tell, me, who, has, done, such, things, before, and, sung, your, honor, to, the, very, stars, excerpt, of, tycho, brahe, s, elegy, to, dania, when, frederick, died, in, 1588, his, son, and, heir, christian, iv, was, only, 11, years, old, a, regency, council, was, appointed, to, rule, for, the, young, prince, elect, until, his, coronation, in, 1596, the, head, of, the, council, steward, of, the, realm, was, christoffer, valkendorff, who, disliked, tycho, after, a, conflict, between, them, and, hence, tycho, s, influence, at, the, danish, court, steadily, declined, feeling, that, his, legacy, on, hven, was, in, peril, he, approached, the, dowager, queen, sophie, and, asked, her, to, affirm, in, writing, her, late, husband, s, promise, to, endow, hven, to, tycho, s, heirs, he, realized, that, the, young, king, was, more, interested, in, war, than, in, science, and, was, of, no, mind, to, keep, his, father, s, promise, king, christian, iv, followed, a, policy, of, curbing, the, power, of, the, nobility, by, confiscating, their, estates, to, minimize, their, income, bases, by, accusing, nobles, of, misusing, their, offices, and, of, heresies, against, the, lutheran, church, tycho, who, was, known, to, sympathize, with, the, philippists, followers, of, philip, melanchthon, was, among, the, nobles, who, fell, out, of, grace, with, the, new, king, the, king, s, unfavorable, disposition, towards, tycho, was, likely, also, a, result, of, efforts, by, several, of, his, enemies, at, court, to, turn, the, king, against, him, in, addition, to, valkendorff, tycho, s, enemies, included, the, king, s, doctor, peter, severinus, who, also, had, personal, gripes, with, tycho, several, gnesio, lutheran, bishops, suspected, tycho, of, heresy, a, suspicion, motivated, by, his, known, philippist, sympathies, his, pursuits, in, medicine, and, alchemy, both, of, which, he, practiced, without, the, church, s, approval, and, his, prohibiting, the, local, priest, on, hven, to, include, the, exorcism, in, the, baptismal, ritual, among, the, accusations, raised, against, tycho, were, his, failure, to, adequately, maintain, the, royal, chapel, at, roskilde, and, his, harshness, and, exploitation, of, the, hven, peasantry, tycho, became, even, more, inclined, to, leave, when, a, mob, of, commoners, possibly, incited, by, his, enemies, at, court, rioted, in, front, of, his, house, in, copenhagen, tycho, left, hven, in, 1597, bringing, some, of, his, instruments, with, him, to, copenhagen, and, entrusting, others, to, a, caretaker, on, the, island, shortly, before, leaving, he, completed, his, star, catalogue, giving, the, positions, of, 1, 000, stars, after, some, unsuccessful, attempts, at, influencing, the, king, to, let, him, return, including, showcasing, his, instruments, on, the, wall, of, the, city, he, acquiesced, to, exile, he, wrote, his, most, famous, poem, elegy, to, dania, in, which, he, chided, denmark, for, not, appreciating, his, genius, the, instruments, he, had, used, in, uraniborg, and, stjerneborg, were, depicted, and, described, in, detail, in, his, star, catalogue, astronomiae, instauratae, mechanica, or, instruments, for, the, restoration, of, astronomy, first, published, in, 1598, the, king, sent, two, envoys, to, hven, to, describe, the, instruments, left, behind, by, tycho, unversed, in, astronomy, the, envoys, reported, to, the, king, that, the, large, mechanical, contraptions, such, as, his, large, quadrant, and, sextant, were, useless, and, even, harmful, from, 1597, to, 1598, he, spent, a, year, at, the, castle, of, his, friend, heinrich, rantzau, at, haus, wandesburg, in, wandsbek, outside, hamburg, then, they, moved, for, a, while, to, wittenberg, where, they, stayed, in, the, former, home, of, philip, melanchthon, in, 1599, he, obtained, the, sponsorship, of, rudolf, ii, holy, roman, emperor, and, moved, to, prague, as, imperial, court, astronomer, tycho, built, a, new, observatory, in, a, castle, in, ben, tky, nad, jizerou, 50, km, from, prague, and, worked, there, for, one, year, the, emperor, then, brought, him, back, to, prague, where, he, stayed, until, his, death, at, the, imperial, court, even, tycho, s, wife, and, children, were, treated, like, nobility, which, they, had, never, been, at, the, danish, court, tycho, received, financial, support, from, several, nobles, in, addition, to, the, emperor, including, oldrich, desiderius, pruskowsky, von, pruskow, to, whom, he, dedicated, his, famous, mechanica, in, return, for, their, support, tycho, s, duties, included, preparing, astrological, charts, and, predictions, for, his, patrons, at, events, such, as, births, weather, forecasting, and, astrological, interpretations, of, significant, astronomical, events, such, as, the, supernova, of, 1572, sometimes, called, tycho, s, supernova, and, the, great, comet, of, 1577, in, prague, tycho, worked, closely, with, kepler, his, assistant, kepler, was, a, convinced, copernican, and, considered, tycho, s, model, to, be, mistaken, and, derived, from, simple, inversion, of, the, sun, s, and, earth, s, positions, in, the, copernican, model, together, the, two, worked, on, a, new, star, catalogue, based, on, his, own, accurate, positions, this, catalogue, became, the, rudolphine, tables, also, at, the, court, in, prague, was, the, mathematician, nicolaus, reimers, ursus, with, whom, tycho, had, previously, corresponded, and, who, like, tycho, had, developed, a, geo, heliocentric, planetary, model, which, tycho, considered, to, have, been, plagiarized, from, his, own, kepler, had, previously, spoken, highly, of, ursus, but, now, found, himself, in, the, problematic, position, of, being, employed, by, tycho, and, having, to, defend, his, employer, against, ursus, accusations, even, though, he, disagreed, with, both, of, their, planetary, models, in, 1600, he, finished, the, tract, apologia, pro, tychone, contra, ursum, defense, of, tycho, against, ursus, kepler, had, great, respect, for, tycho, s, methods, and, the, accuracy, of, his, observations, and, considered, him, to, be, the, new, hipparchus, who, would, provide, the, foundation, for, a, restoration, of, the, science, of, astronomy, tycho, suddenly, contracted, a, bladder, or, kidney, ailment, after, attending, a, banquet, in, prague, he, died, eleven, days, later, on, 24, october, 1601, at, the, age, of, 54, according, to, kepler, s, first, hand, account, tycho, had, refused, to, leave, the, banquet, to, relieve, himself, because, it, would, have, been, a, breach, of, etiquette, after, he, returned, home, he, was, no, longer, able, to, urinate, except, eventually, in, very, small, quantities, and, with, excruciating, pain, the, night, before, he, died, he, suffered, from, a, delirium, during, which, he, was, frequently, heard, to, exclaim, that, he, hoped, he, would, not, seem, to, have, lived, in, vain, before, dying, he, urged, kepler, to, finish, the, rudolphine, tables, and, expressed, the, hope, that, he, would, do, so, by, adopting, tycho, s, own, planetary, system, rather, than, that, of, the, polymath, nicolaus, copernicus, it, was, reported, that, tycho, had, written, his, own, epitaph, he, lived, like, a, sage, and, died, like, a, fool, a, contemporary, physician, attributed, his, death, to, a, kidney, stone, but, no, kidney, stones, were, found, during, an, autopsy, performed, after, his, body, was, exhumed, in, 1901, modern, medical, assessment, is, that, his, death, was, more, likely, caused, by, either, a, burst, bladder, prostatic, hypertrophy, acute, prostatitis, or, prostate, cancer, which, led, to, urinary, retention, overflow, incontinence, and, uremia, investigations, in, the, 1990s, suggested, that, tycho, may, not, have, died, from, urinary, problems, but, instead, from, mercury, poisoning, it, was, speculated, that, he, had, been, intentionally, poisoned, the, two, main, suspects, were, his, assistant, johannes, kepler, whose, motives, would, be, to, gain, access, to, tycho, s, laboratory, and, chemicals, and, his, cousin, erik, brahe, at, the, order, of, friend, turned, enemy, christian, iv, because, of, rumors, that, tycho, had, had, an, affair, with, christian, s, mother, in, february, 2010, the, prague, city, authorities, approved, a, request, by, danish, scientists, to, exhume, the, remains, and, in, november, 2010, a, group, of, czech, and, danish, scientists, from, aarhus, university, collected, bone, hair, and, clothing, samples, for, analysis, the, scientists, led, by, jens, vellev, analyzed, tycho, s, beard, hair, once, again, the, team, reported, in, november, 2012, that, there, was, not, enough, mercury, present, to, substantiate, murder, and, there, were, no, lethal, levels, of, any, poisons, present, the, team, s, conclusion, was, that, it, is, impossible, that, tycho, brahe, could, have, been, murdered, the, findings, were, confirmed, by, scientists, from, the, university, of, rostock, who, examined, a, sample, of, tycho, s, beard, hairs, that, had, been, taken, in, 1901, although, traces, of, mercury, were, found, these, were, present, only, in, the, outer, scales, therefore, mercury, poisoning, as, the, cause, of, death, was, ruled, out, the, study, suggests, that, the, accumulation, of, mercury, may, have, come, from, the, precipitation, of, mercury, dust, from, the, air, during, long, term, alchemistic, activities, tycho, is, buried, in, the, church, of, our, lady, before, t, n, in, old, town, square, near, the, prague, astronomical, clock, tycho, s, view, of, science, was, driven, by, his, passion, for, accurate, observations, and, the, quest, for, improved, instruments, of, measurement, drove, his, life, s, work, tycho, was, the, last, major, astronomer, to, work, without, the, aid, of, a, telescope, soon, to, be, turned, skyward, by, galileo, galilei, and, others, given, the, limitations, of, the, naked, eye, for, making, accurate, observations, he, devoted, many, of, his, efforts, to, improving, the, accuracy, of, the, existing, types, of, instrument, the, sextant, and, the, quadrant, he, designed, larger, versions, of, these, instruments, which, allowed, him, to, achieve, much, higher, accuracy, because, of, the, accuracy, of, his, instruments, he, quickly, realized, the, influence, of, wind, and, the, movement, of, buildings, and, instead, opted, to, mount, his, instruments, underground, directly, on, the, bedrock, tycho, s, observations, of, stellar, and, planetary, positions, were, noteworthy, both, for, their, accuracy, and, quantity, with, an, accuracy, approaching, one, arcminute, his, celestial, positions, were, much, more, accurate, than, those, of, any, predecessor, or, contemporary, about, five, times, as, accurate, as, the, observations, of, wilhelm, of, hesse, rawlins, 1993, b2, asserts, of, tycho, s, star, catalog, d, in, it, tycho, achieved, on, a, mass, scale, a, precision, far, beyond, that, of, earlier, catalogers, cat, d, represents, an, unprecedented, confluence, of, skills, instrumental, observational, computational, all, of, which, combined, to, enable, tycho, to, place, most, of, his, hundreds, of, recorded, stars, to, an, accuracy, of, ordermag, 1, he, aspired, to, a, level, of, accuracy, in, his, estimated, positions, of, celestial, bodies, of, being, consistently, within, an, arcminute, of, their, real, celestial, locations, and, also, claimed, to, have, achieved, this, level, but, in, fact, many, of, the, stellar, positions, in, his, star, catalogues, were, less, accurate, than, that, the, median, errors, for, the, stellar, positions, in, his, final, published, catalog, were, about, 1, 5, indicating, that, only, half, of, the, entries, were, more, accurate, than, that, with, an, overall, mean, error, in, each, coordinate, of, around, 2, although, the, stellar, observations, as, recorded, in, his, observational, logs, were, more, accurate, varying, from, 32, 3, to, 48, 8, for, different, instruments, systematic, errors, of, as, much, as, 3, were, introduced, into, some, of, the, stellar, positions, tycho, published, in, his, star, catalog, due, for, instance, to, his, application, of, an, erroneous, ancient, value, of, parallax, and, his, neglect, of, polestar, refraction, incorrect, transcription, in, the, final, published, star, catalogue, by, scribes, in, tycho, s, employ, was, the, source, of, even, larger, errors, sometimes, by, many, degrees, celestial, objects, observed, near, the, horizon, and, above, appear, with, a, greater, altitude, than, the, real, one, due, to, atmospheric, refraction, and, one, of, tycho, s, most, important, innovations, was, that, he, worked, out, and, published, the, very, first, tables, for, the, systematic, correction, of, this, possible, source, of, error, but, as, advanced, as, they, were, they, attributed, no, refraction, whatever, above, 45, altitude, for, solar, refraction, and, none, for, starlight, above, 20, altitude, to, perform, the, huge, number, of, multiplications, needed, to, produce, much, of, his, astronomical, data, tycho, relied, heavily, on, the, then, new, technique, of, prosthaphaeresis, an, algorithm, for, approximating, products, based, on, trigonometric, identities, that, predated, logarithms, many, of, tycho, s, observations, and, discoveries, were, done, with, the, aid, of, various, instruments, many, of, which, he, himself, made, the, process, that, went, into, creating, and, refining, his, devices, was, haphazard, at, first, but, were, critical, in, the, advancement, of, his, observations, he, pioneered, an, early, example, while, he, was, a, student, in, leipzig, while, he, was, gazing, at, the, stars, he, realized, that, he, needed, a, better, way, to, write, down, not, just, his, observations, but, also, the, angles, and, descriptions, as, well, so, he, pioneered, the, use, of, the, observational, in, this, notebook, he, made, his, observations, and, asked, himself, questions, to, try, and, answer, later, on, tycho, also, made, sketches, of, what, he, saw, as, well, from, comets, to, the, motions, of, planets, his, astronomical, instrument, innovation, continued, after, his, schooling, when, he, gained, access, to, his, inheritance, he, went, straight, to, work, creating, brand, new, instruments, to, replace, the, ones, he, used, as, a, student, tycho, created, a, quadrant, that, was, thirty, nine, centimeters, in, diameter, and, added, a, new, type, of, sight, to, it, called, a, pinnacidia, or, light, cutters, as, it, is, translated, this, brand, new, sight, meant, that, the, old, pinhole, style, sight, was, rendered, obsolete, when, the, sights, of, the, pinnacidia, were, aligned, in, the, correct, manner, the, object, that, it, is, lined, up, with, it, will, look, exactly, the, same, from, both, ends, this, instrument, was, kept, still, on, a, heavy, duty, base, and, adjusted, via, a, brass, plumb, line, and, thumb, screws, all, of, which, helped, give, tycho, brahe, more, accurate, measurements, of, the, heavens, there, were, times, that, the, instruments, tycho, made, were, for, a, specific, purpose, or, an, event, that, he, was, witness, to, such, was, the, case, in, 1577, when, he, first, started, construction, of, what, would, be, called, uraniborg, in, that, year, a, comet, was, spotted, moving, across, the, sky, during, this, period, of, time, tycho, made, many, observations, and, one, of, the, instruments, that, he, used, to, make, his, observations, was, called, a, brass, azimuthal, quadrant, at, sixty, five, centimeters, in, radius, it, was, a, large, instrument, built, either, in, 1576, or, 1577, just, in, time, for, tycho, to, use, it, to, observe, the, path, and, distance, of, the, 1577, comet, this, instrument, helped, him, to, accurately, track, the, comet, s, path, as, it, crossed, the, orbits, of, the, solar, system, a, great, many, more, instruments, were, constructed, at, tycho, brahe, s, new, manor, on, hven, called, uraniborg, it, was, a, combination, of, a, home, observatories, and, laboratory, where, he, made, some, of, his, discoveries, along, with, many, of, his, instruments, several, of, these, instruments, were, very, large, such, as, a, steel, azimuth, quadrant, equipped, with, a, brass, arc, that, was, six, feet, or, 194, centimeters, in, diameter, this, and, other, instruments, were, placed, in, the, two, observatories, attached, to, the, manor, although, tycho, admired, copernicus, and, was, the, first, to, teach, his, theory, in, denmark, he, was, unable, to, reconcile, copernican, theory, with, the, basic, laws, of, aristotelian, physics, which, he, believed, to, be, foundational, he, was, critical, of, the, observational, data, that, copernicus, built, his, theory, on, which, he, correctly, considered, to, be, inaccurate, instead, tycho, proposed, a, geo, heliocentric, system, in, which, the, sun, and, moon, orbited, the, earth, while, the, other, planets, orbited, the, sun, his, system, had, many, of, the, observational, and, computational, advantages, of, copernicus, system, it, provided, a, safe, position, for, those, astronomers, who, were, dissatisfied, with, older, models, but, reluctant, to, accept, heliocentrism, it, gained, a, following, after, 1616, when, the, catholic, church, declared, the, heliocentric, model, to, be, contrary, to, philosophy, and, christian, scripture, and, only, able, to, be, discussed, as, a, computational, convenience, tycho, s, system, offered, a, major, innovation, in, that, it, eliminated, the, idea, of, transparent, rotating, crystalline, spheres, to, carry, the, planets, in, their, orbits, kepler, and, other, copernican, astronomers, tried, unsuccessfully, to, persuade, tycho, to, adopt, the, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, to, tycho, the, idea, of, a, moving, earth, was, in, violation, not, only, of, all, physical, truth, but, also, of, the, authority, of, holy, scripture, which, ought, to, be, paramount, tycho, held, that, the, earth, was, too, sluggish, and, massive, to, be, continuously, in, motion, according, to, the, accepted, aristotelian, physics, of, the, time, the, heavens, whose, motions, and, cycles, were, continuous, and, unending, were, made, of, aether, a, substance, not, found, on, earth, that, caused, objects, to, move, in, a, circle, by, contrast, objects, on, earth, seem, to, have, motion, only, when, moved, and, the, natural, state, of, objects, on, its, surface, was, rest, tycho, said, the, earth, was, an, inert, body, not, readily, moved, he, acknowledged, that, the, rising, and, setting, of, the, sun, and, stars, could, be, explained, by, a, rotating, earth, as, copernicus, had, said, still, such, a, fast, motion, could, not, belong, to, the, earth, a, body, very, heavy, and, dense, and, opaque, but, rather, belongs, to, the, sky, itself, whose, form, and, subtle, and, constant, matter, are, better, suited, to, a, perpetual, motion, however, fast, tycho, believed, that, if, the, earth, did, orbit, the, sun, there, should, be, an, observable, stellar, parallax, every, six, months, the, stars, positions, would, change, thanks, to, earth, s, changing, position, the, lack, of, any, stellar, parallax, was, explained, by, the, copernican, theory, as, being, due, to, the, stars, enormous, distances, from, earth, tycho, noted, and, attempted, to, measure, the, apparent, relative, sizes, of, the, stars, in, the, sky, he, used, geometry, to, show, that, the, distance, to, the, stars, in, the, copernican, system, would, have, to, be, 700, times, greater, than, the, distance, from, the, sun, to, saturn, and, to, be, seen, at, these, distances, the, stars, would, have, to, be, gigantic, at, least, as, big, as, the, orbit, of, the, earth, and, of, course, vastly, larger, than, the, sun, tycho, said, deduce, these, things, geometrically, if, you, like, and, you, will, see, how, many, absurdities, not, to, mention, others, accompany, this, assumption, by, inference, copernicans, offered, a, religious, response, to, tycho, s, geometry, titanic, distant, stars, might, seem, unreasonable, but, they, were, not, for, the, creator, could, make, his, creations, that, large, if, he, wanted, in, fact, rothmann, responded, to, this, argument, of, tycho, s, by, saying, hat, is, so, absurd, about, having, size, equal, to, the, whole, what, of, this, is, contrary, to, divine, will, or, is, impossible, by, divine, nature, or, is, inadmissible, by, infinite, nature, these, things, must, be, entirely, demonstrated, by, you, if, you, will, wish, to, infer, from, here, anything, of, the, absurd, these, things, that, vulgar, sorts, see, as, absurd, at, first, glance, are, not, easily, charged, with, absurdity, for, in, fact, divine, sapience, and, majesty, is, far, greater, than, they, understand, grant, the, vastness, of, the, universe, and, the, sizes, of, the, stars, to, be, as, great, as, you, like, these, will, still, bear, no, proportion, to, the, infinite, creator, it, reckons, that, the, greater, the, king, so, much, greater, and, larger, the, palace, befitting, his, majesty, so, how, great, a, palace, do, you, reckon, is, fitting, to, god, religion, played, a, role, in, tycho, s, geocentrism, he, cited, the, authority, of, scripture, in, portraying, the, earth, as, being, at, rest, he, rarely, used, biblical, arguments, alone, to, him, they, were, a, secondary, objection, to, the, idea, of, earth, s, motion, and, over, time, he, came, to, focus, on, scientific, arguments, but, he, did, take, biblical, arguments, seriously, tycho, s, 1587, geo, heliocentric, model, differed, from, those, of, other, geo, heliocentric, astronomers, such, as, wittich, reimarus, ursus, helisaeus, roeslin, and, david, origanus, in, that, the, orbits, of, mars, and, the, sun, intersected, this, was, because, tycho, had, come, to, believe, the, distance, of, mars, from, the, earth, at, opposition, that, is, when, mars, is, on, the, opposite, side, of, the, sky, from, the, sun, was, less, than, that, of, the, sun, from, the, earth, tycho, believed, this, because, he, came, to, believe, mars, had, a, greater, daily, parallax, than, the, sun, in, 1584, in, a, letter, to, a, fellow, astronomer, brucaeus, he, had, claimed, that, mars, had, been, further, than, the, sun, at, the, opposition, of, 1582, because, he, had, observed, that, mars, had, little, or, no, daily, parallax, he, said, he, had, therefore, rejected, copernicus, s, model, because, it, predicted, mars, would, be, at, only, two, thirds, the, distance, of, the, sun, he, apparently, later, changed, his, mind, to, the, opinion, that, mars, at, opposition, was, indeed, nearer, the, earth, than, the, sun, was, but, apparently, without, any, valid, observational, evidence, in, any, discernible, martian, parallax, such, intersecting, martian, and, solar, orbits, meant, that, there, could, be, no, solid, rotating, celestial, spheres, because, they, could, not, possibly, interpenetrate, arguably, this, conclusion, was, independently, supported, by, the, conclusion, that, the, comet, of, 1577, was, superlunary, because, it, showed, less, daily, parallax, than, the, moon, and, thus, must, pass, through, any, celestial, spheres, in, its, transit, while, tycho, brahe, and, his, contemporaries, lacked, a, fully, developed, alternative, to, aristotelian, physics, brahe, s, comet, observations, cast, significant, doubt, on, its, validity, tycho, s, distinctive, contributions, to, lunar, theory, include, his, discovery, of, the, variation, of, the, moon, s, longitude, this, represents, the, largest, inequality, of, longitude, after, the, equation, of, the, center, and, the, evection, he, also, discovered, librations, in, the, inclination, of, the, plane, of, the, lunar, orbit, relative, to, the, ecliptic, which, is, not, a, constant, of, about, 5, as, had, been, believed, before, him, but, fluctuates, through, a, range, of, over, a, quarter, of, a, degree, and, accompanying, oscillations, in, the, longitude, of, the, lunar, node, these, represent, perturbations, in, the, moon, s, ecliptic, latitude, tycho, s, lunar, theory, doubled, the, number, of, distinct, lunar, inequalities, relative, to, those, anciently, known, and, reduced, the, discrepancies, of, lunar, theory, to, about, a, fifth, of, their, previous, amounts, it, was, published, posthumously, by, kepler, in, 1602, and, kepler, s, own, derivative, form, appears, in, kepler, s, rudolphine, tables, of, 1627, kepler, used, tycho, s, records, of, the, motion, of, mars, to, deduce, laws, of, planetary, motion, enabling, calculation, of, astronomical, tables, with, unprecedented, accuracy, the, rudolphine, tables, and, providing, powerful, support, for, a, heliocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, galileo, s, 1610, telescopic, discovery, that, venus, shows, a, full, set, of, phases, refuted, the, pure, geocentric, ptolemaic, model, after, that, it, seems, 17th, century, astronomy, mostly, converted, to, geo, heliocentric, planetary, models, that, could, explain, these, phases, just, as, well, as, the, heliocentric, model, could, but, without, the, latter, s, disadvantage, of, the, failure, to, detect, any, annual, stellar, parallax, that, tycho, and, others, regarded, as, refuting, it, the, three, main, geo, heliocentric, models, were, the, tychonic, the, capellan, with, just, mercury, and, venus, orbiting, the, sun, such, as, favoured, by, francis, bacon, for, example, and, the, extended, capellan, model, of, riccioli, with, mars, also, orbiting, the, sun, whilst, saturn, and, jupiter, orbit, the, fixed, earth, the, tychonic, model, was, probably, the, most, popular, albeit, probably, in, what, was, known, as, the, semi, tychonic, version, with, a, daily, rotating, earth, this, model, was, advocated, by, tycho, s, ex, assistant, and, disciple, longomontanus, in, his, 1622, astronomia, danica, that, was, the, intended, completion, of, tycho, s, planetary, model, with, his, observational, data, and, which, was, regarded, as, the, canonical, statement, of, the, complete, tychonic, planetary, system, longomontanus, work, was, published, in, several, editions, and, used, by, many, subsequent, astronomers, through, him, the, tychonic, system, was, adopted, by, astronomers, as, far, away, as, china, the, ardent, anti, heliocentric, french, astronomer, jean, baptiste, morin, devised, a, tychonic, planetary, model, with, elliptical, orbits, published, in, 1650, in, a, simplified, tychonic, version, of, the, rudolphine, tables, another, geocentric, french, astronomer, jacques, du, chevreul, rejected, tycho, s, observations, including, his, description, of, the, heavens, and, the, theory, that, mars, was, below, the, sun, some, acceptance, of, the, tychonic, system, persisted, through, the, 17th, century, and, in, places, until, the, early, 18th, century, it, was, supported, after, a, 1633, decree, about, the, copernican, controversy, by, a, flood, of, pro, tycho, literature, of, jesuit, origin, among, pro, tycho, jesuits, ignace, pardies, declared, in, 1691, that, it, was, still, the, commonly, accepted, system, and, francesco, blanchinus, reiterated, that, as, late, as, 1728, persistence, of, the, tychonic, system, especially, in, catholic, countries, has, been, attributed, to, its, satisfaction, of, a, need, relative, to, catholic, doctrine, for, a, safe, synthesis, of, ancient, and, modern, after, 1670, even, many, jesuit, writers, only, thinly, disguised, their, copernicanism, in, germany, the, netherlands, and, england, the, tychonic, system, vanished, from, the, literature, much, earlier, james, bradley, s, discovery, of, stellar, aberration, published, in, 1729, eventually, gave, direct, evidence, excluding, the, possibility, of, all, forms, of, geocentrism, including, tycho, s, stellar, aberration, could, only, be, satisfactorily, explained, on, the, basis, that, the, earth, is, in, annual, orbit, around, the, sun, with, an, orbital, velocity, that, combines, with, the, finite, speed, of, the, light, coming, from, an, observed, star, or, planet, to, affect, the, apparent, direction, of, the, body, observed, tycho, worked, in, medicine, and, alchemy, he, was, influenced, by, the, swiss, physician, paracelsus, who, considered, the, human, body, to, be, directly, affected, by, celestial, bodies, tycho, used, paracelsus, s, ideas, to, connect, empiricism, and, natural, science, and, religion, and, astrology, using, his, herbal, garden, at, uraniborg, tycho, produced, recipes, for, herbal, medicines, and, used, them, to, treat, fever, and, plague, his, herbal, medicines, were, in, use, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, the, expression, tycho, brahe, days, referred, to, unlucky, days, that, were, featured, in, almanacs, from, the, 1700s, onwards, but, which, have, no, direct, connection, to, tycho, or, his, work, whether, because, tycho, realized, that, astrology, was, not, an, empirical, science, or, because, he, feared, religious, repercussions, he, did, not, publicise, his, own, astrological, work, for, example, two, of, his, more, astrological, treatises, one, on, weather, predictions, and, an, almanac, were, published, in, the, names, of, his, assistants, in, spite, of, the, fact, that, he, worked, on, them, personally, some, scholars, have, argued, that, he, lost, faith, in, horoscope, astrology, over, the, course, of, his, career, and, others, that, he, simply, changed, his, public, communication, on, the, topic, as, he, realized, that, connections, with, astrology, could, influence, the, reception, of, his, empirical, astronomical, work, the, first, biography, of, tycho, which, was, also, the, first, full, length, biography, of, any, scientist, was, written, by, gassendi, in, 1654, in, 1779, tycho, de, hoffmann, wrote, of, tycho, s, life, in, his, history, of, the, brahe, family, in, 1913, dreyer, published, tycho, s, collected, works, facilitating, further, research, early, modern, scholarship, on, tycho, tended, to, see, the, shortcomings, of, his, astronomical, model, painting, him, as, a, mysticist, recalcitrant, in, accepting, the, copernican, revolution, and, valuing, mostly, his, observations, that, allowed, kepler, to, formulate, his, laws, of, planetary, movement, especially, in, danish, scholarship, tycho, was, depicted, as, a, mediocre, scholar, and, a, traitor, to, the, nation, perhaps, because, of, the, important, role, in, danish, historiography, of, christian, iv, as, a, warrior, king, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, scholars, began, reevaluating, his, significance, and, studies, by, kristian, peder, moesgaard, owen, gingerich, robert, westman, victor, e, thoren, john, r, christianson, and, c, doris, hellman, focused, on, his, contributions, to, science, and, demonstrated, that, while, he, admired, copernicus, he, was, simply, unable, to, reconcile, his, basic, theory, of, physics, with, the, copernican, view, christianson, s, work, showed, the, influence, of, tycho, s, uraniborg, as, a, training, center, for, scientists, who, after, studying, with, tycho, went, on, to, make, contributions, in, various, scientific, fields, although, tycho, s, planetary, model, was, soon, discredited, his, astronomical, observations, were, an, essential, contribution, to, the, scientific, revolution, the, traditional, view, of, tycho, is, that, he, was, primarily, an, empiricist, who, set, new, standards, for, precise, and, objective, measurements, this, appraisal, originated, in, gassendi, s, 1654, biography, tychonis, brahe, equitis, dani, astronomorum, coryphaei, vita, it, was, furthered, by, dreyer, s, biography, in, 1890, which, was, long, the, most, influential, work, on, tycho, according, to, historian, of, science, helge, kragh, this, assessment, grew, out, of, gassendi, s, opposition, to, aristotelianism, and, cartesianism, and, fails, to, account, for, the, diversity, of, tycho, s, activities, the, tycho, brahe, prize, inaugurated, in, 2008, is, awarded, annually, by, the, european, astronomical, society, in, recognition, of, the, pioneering, development, or, exploitation, of, european, astronomical, instrumentation, or, major, discoveries, based, largely, on, such, instruments, tycho, s, discovery, of, the, new, star, was, the, inspiration, for, edgar, allan, poe, s, poem, al, aaraaf, in, 1998, sky, telescope, magazine, published, an, article, by, donald, olson, marilynn, s, olson, and, russell, l, doescher, arguing, in, part, that, tycho, s, supernova, was, also, the, same, star, that, s, westward, from, the, pole, in, shakespeare, s, hamlet, tycho, is, directly,
