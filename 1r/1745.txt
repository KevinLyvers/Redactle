as, a, private, researcher, in, 1886, berliner, began, experimenting, with, methods, of, sound, recording, and, reproduction, he, was, granted, his, first, patent, for, what, he, called, the, gramophone, in, 1887, the, patent, described, recording, sound, using, horizontal, modulation, of, a, stylus, as, it, traced, a, line, on, a, rotating, cylindrical, surface, coated, with, an, unresisting, opaque, material, such, as, lampblack, subsequently, fixed, with, varnish, and, used, to, photoengrave, a, corresponding, groove, into, the, surface, of, a, metal, playback, cylinder, in, practice, berliner, opted, for, the, disc, format, which, made, the, photoengraving, step, much, less, difficult, and, offered, the, prospect, of, making, multiple, copies, of, the, result, by, some, simpler, process, such, as, electrotyping, molding, or, stamping, in, 1888, berliner, was, using, a, more, direct, recording, method, in, which, the, stylus, traced, a, line, through, a, very, thin, coating, of, wax, on, a, zinc, disc, which, was, then, etched, in, acid, to, convert, the, line, of, bared, metal, into, a, playable, groove, by, 1890, a, berliner, licensee, in, germany, was, manufacturing, a, toy, gramophone, and, five, inch, hard, rubber, discs, stamped, out, replicas, of, etched, zinc, master, discs, but, because, key, u, s, patents, were, still, pending, they, were, sold, only, in, europe, berliner, meant, his, gramophone, to, be, more, than, a, mere, toy, and, in, 1894, he, persuaded, a, group, of, businessmen, to, invest, 25, 000, with, which, he, started, the, united, states, gramophone, company, he, began, marketing, seven, inch, records, and, a, more, substantial, gramophone, which, was, however, still, hand, propelled, like, the, smaller, toy, machine, the, difficulty, in, using, early, hand, driven, gramophones, was, getting, the, turntable, to, rotate, at, an, acceptably, steady, speed, engineer, eldridge, r, johnson, the, owner, of, a, small, machine, shop, in, camden, new, jersey, helped, berliner, develop, a, suitable, low, cost, wind, up, spring, motor, for, the, gramophone, then, to, manufacture, it, berliner, gave, frank, seaman, the, exclusive, sales, rights, in, the, u, s, but, after, disagreements, seaman, began, selling, his, own, version, of, the, gramophone, as, well, as, unauthorized, copies, of, berliner, s, records, ultimately, berliner, was, legally, barred, from, selling, his, own, products, the, u, s, berliner, gramophone, company, shut, down, in, mid, 1900, and, berliner, moved, to, canada, following, various, legal, maneuvers, johnson, founded, the, victor, talking, machine, company, in, 1901, and, the, trade, name, gramophone, was, soon, abandoned, in, the, u, s, although, its, use, continued,
