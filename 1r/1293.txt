wrote, i, am, not, a, subject, of, the, king, of, france, but, i, believe, i, can, truly, say, that, the, declarations, of, the, spanish, have, declared, me, to, be, french, so, that, with, justice, one, can, say, that, france, is, my, country, his, position, in, rome, was, increasingly, difficult, he, had, the, affection, of, pope, urban, viii, but, he, was, disliked, by, cardinal, barberini,

to, richelieu, for, the, cardinal, s, new, palace, in, paris, he, considered, serving, the, rulers, of, savoy, poland, or, queen, henriette, of, england, but, in, the, end, he, decided, to, enter, the, service, of, richelieu, and, france, however, richelieu, was, in, no, hurry, to, bring, him, to, paris, he, valued, the, diplomatic, contributions, mazarin, was, making, in, rome, as, well, as,

of, austria, to, whom, mazarin, had, regularly, sent, perfumes, fans, gloves, and, other, gifts, the, queen, was, at, this, time, pregnant, with, her, second, child, and, it, was, already,

august, 1641, mazarin, declared, that, it, was, perfect, so, lifelike, that, as, he, wrote, it, seemed, about, to, speak, but, french, tastes, did, not, approve, of, the, baroque, style, the, other, members, of, the, court, condemned, the, work, and, mazarin, wrote, back, to, bernini, sending, him, more, pictures, of, richelieu, and, asking, him, to, try, again, richelieu, sent, mazarin, on, several, delicate, diplomatic, missions, including, a, long, trip, to, savoy, to, straighten, out, the, tangled, political, affairs, there, the, regency, of, christine, the, duchess, of, savoy, and, sister, of, louis, xiii, was, challenged, by, her, brothers, in, law, the, princes, maurice, and, thomas, of, savoy, see, piedmontese, civil, war, mazarin, successfully, secured, christine, s, position, and, established, a, solid, alliance, between, savoy, and, france, this, task, kept, him, away, from, paris, for, nine, months, until, june, 1641, on, 16, december, 1641, though, he, had, not, reached, his, fortieth, birthday, he, received, what, he, most, desired, he, was, formally, made, a, cardinal, he, had, established, a, cordial, relationship, with, richelieu, richelieu, jokingly, referred, to, him, as, rinzama, an, anagram, of, his, name, or, nunzinicardo, dear, little, envoy, or, most, frequently, colmarduccio, or, colmardo, when, was, asked, what, it, meant, he, translated, into, french, as, fr, re, coupechou, the, term, for, a, junior, candidate, monk, who, was, assigned, to, chop, cabbage, in, the, kitchen, of, the, abbey, however, he, did, not, send, mazarin, on, the, mission, that, he, most, wanted, as, delegate, of, france, to, a, europe, wide, peace, conference, richelieu, s, attention, was, devoted, to, making, war, richelieu, who, was,

to, capture, roussillon, and, in, january, 1642, to, lay, siege, to, narbonne, on, 11, june, 1642, while, in, tarascon, on, one, of, the, long, military, expeditions, mazarin, was, presented, with, evidence, that, gaston, duke, of, orl, ans, the, brother, of, louis, xiii, and, the, marquis, of, cinq, mars, one, of, the, king, s, closest, advisors, had, made, a, secret, agreement, with, the, king, of, spain, without, the, knowledge, of, richelieu, or, the, king, it, appeared, probable, that, the, queen, anne, of, austria, was, also, aware, of, this, secret, betrayal, of, richelieu, but, did, not, tell, him, or, the, king, cinq, mars, was, arrested, gaston, was, disgraced, and, another, conspirator, the, duke, of, bouillon, was, granted, a, pardon, on, the, condition, of, revealing, all, the, details, of, the, plot, to, mazarin, and, surrendering, the, important, fortress, of, sedan, to, the, king, mazarin, did, not, reveal, the, participation, of, the, queen, in, the, conspiracy, but, his, knowledge, gave, him, even, greater, leverage, at, the, court, the, destruction, of, the, conspiracy, against, the, king, was, one, of, the, last, acts, of, cardinal, richelieu, he, fell, ill, and, died, on, 4, december, 1642, the, succession, of, mazarin, to, the, position, of, chief, minister, of, louis, xiii, was, not, automatic, or, immediate, despite, the, accounts, of, some, later, historians, richelieu, did, not, name, mazarin, as, his, successor, richelieu, did, according, to, mazarin, himself, advise, the, king, to, employ, mazarin, who, until, that, time, had, no, official, position, at, court, after, the, death, of, richelieu, louis, xiii, named, three, prominent, figures, to, advise, him, fran, ois, sublet, de, noyers, l, on, bouthillier, comte, de, chavigny, and, mazarin, mazarin, and, de, chavigny, immediately, joined, together, to, get, rid, of, de, noyers, they, hinted, to, the, king, that, de, noyers, had, secretly, made, an, agreement, with, anne, of, austria, to, make, her, the, regent, of, france, after, the, king, s, death, the, king, who, had, little, love, for, the, queen, and, in, his, will, had, refused, to, make, her, his, regent, was, furious, de, noyers, was, forced, to, resign, on, 10, april, 1643, louis, xiii, died, 14, may, 1643, just, five, months, after, richelieu, his, successor, louis, xiv, was, just, four, years, old, the, king, had, specifically, instructed, that, his, wife, anne, of, austria, not, rule, in, his, place, as, regent, however, as, soon, as, he, was, dead, she, applied, to, the, body, of, nobles, known, as, the, parlement, of, paris, and, had, his, will, annulled, she, was, declared, regent, on, 18, may, the, queen, had, a, particular, dislike, of, de, chavigny, the, other, chief, advisor, chosen, by, louis, xiii, he, had, been, close, to, richelieu, and, was, the, only, real, rival, in, experience, to, mazarin, the, evening, that, she, became, regent, she, declared, that, mazarin, would, be, her, chief, minister, and, head, of, her, government, the, management, style, of, mazarin, was, entirely, different, from, that, of, richelieu, the, contrast, was, described, by, cardinal, retz, the, future, enemy, of, mazarin, in, his, memoires, one, saw, on, the, steps, of, the, throne, where, the, sharp, and, fearsome, richelieu, had, thundered, rather, than, governed, the, people, a, leader, who, is, gentle, benevolent, and, demands, nothing, he, has, the, spirit, the, insinuation, the, playfulness, the, manners, but, also, a, certain, laziness, cardinal, retz, and, other, rivals, in, the, court, underestimated, mazarin, s, skills, energy, and, determination, mazarin, continued, richelieu, s, costly, war, against, the, chief, rivals, of, france, in, europe, the, habsburgs, of, austria, and, spain, the, victories, of, cond, and, turenne, finally, brought, austria, to, the, bargaining, table, and, ended, the, thirty, years, war, with, the, peace, of,

the, low, countries, towards, protestantism, at, home, mazarin, pursued, a, policy, of, promises, and, calculated, delay, to, defuse, the, armed, insurrection, of, the, ard, che, 1653, for, example, and, to, keep, the, huguenots, disarmed, for, six, years, they, believed, themselves, to, be, on, the, eve, of, recovering, the, protections, of, the, edict, of, nantes, but, in, the, end, they,

implications, than, out, of, theology, on, his, deathbed, he, warned, young, louis, xiv, not, to, tolerate, the, jansenist, sect, not, even, their, name, after, his, death, louis, xiv, did, not,

outside, the, city, limits, since, the, city, had, grown, well, outside, its, old, boundaries, in, 1644, he, imposed, heavy, fines, on, all, those, who, lived, outside, the, city, limits, in,

served, on, the, various, royal, courts, and, councils, amounting, to, four, years, of, their, fees, the, center, of, resistance, was, the, paris, parlement, an, ancient, assembly, of, nobles, which, served, as, a, high, court, of, appeals, it, was, a, period, of, rebellion, against, monarchs, across, europe, independence, movements, appeared, in, the, spanish, provinces, of, catalonia, and, portugal, a, revolutionary, seized, power, in, naples, and, charles, i, of, england, the, brother, in, law, of, louis, xiii, was, deposed, and, executed, in, 1649, in, paris, the, members, of, the, parlement, called, a, special, session, to, debate, mazarin, s, measures, the, meeting, was, forbidden, by, regent, anne, of, austria, but, went, ahead, anyway, the, parlement, issued, a, charter, inspired, by, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, in, england, which, revoked, the, authority, of, the, king, s, justice, officials, forbade, any, new, taxes, without, the, approval, of, the, parlement, and, declared, that, no, royal, subjects, could, be, imprisoned, without, due, process, of, law, mazarin, recommended, to, the, queen, that, she, listen, to, the, parlement, and, modify, her, decrees, but, she, was, furious, at, their, opposition, she, waited, until, the, right, moment, to, strike, back, the, occasion, she, chose, was, the, celebration, of, a, major, victory, of, the, french, army, over, the, spanish, at, the, battle, of, lens, in, belgium, on, 26, august, 1648, on, the, day, that, a, special, mass, was, held, at, the, cathedral, of, notre, dame, de, paris, to, celebrate, the, victory, she, gave, orders, to, the, captain, of, her, guards, to, arrest, the, leaders, of, the, parlement, including, the, popular, pierre, broussel, news, of, the, arrest, quickly, spread, in, paris, and, crowds, came, out, into, the, street, to, protest, and, to, build, barricades, that, evening, mazarin, wrote, in, his, journal, the, parlement, has, performed, the, functions, of, the, king, and, the, people, have, deferred, to, it, entirely, during, the, fronde, the, anti, mazarin, crowds, of, paris, enjoyed, listening, to, mazarinades, popular, songs, with, verses, mocking, the, cardinal, dozens, were, written, and, published, accusing, him, of, virtually, all, possible, faults, and, crimes, mazarin, had, a, sense, of, humor, and, when, the, fronde, was, finished, he, had, the, best, mazarinades, collected, and, performed, in, a, concert, at, his, palace, the, rebellion, lasted, for, three, years, it, took, its, popular, name, fronde, from, the, children, s, slings, frondes, which, were, used, by, the, mobs, in, the, paris, streets, to, hurl, stones, it, combined, the, anger, of, the, parisians, against, the, new, taxes, with, the, resentment, of, the, nobility, against, the, reduction, of, their, ancient, privileges, it, was, led, over, time, by, an, odd, assortment, of, allies, gaston, d, orleans, the, brother, of, louis, xiii, louis, ii, de, bourbon, prince, de, cond, a, brilliant, general, but, poor, politician, and, the, cardinal, paul, de, gondi, a, consummate, intriguer, each, of, them, had, different, goals, but, all, agreed, that, mazarin, should, fall, when, the, fronde, began, the, french, army, commanded, by, the, prince, de, cond, was, far, from, paris, fighting, the, austrians, mazarin, quickly, sent, an, envoy, to, the, emperor, in, vienna, calling, for, a, truce, and, peace, conference, the, peace, of, westphalia, ending, the, war, was, signed, 24, october, 1648, despite, the, peace, disturbances, continued, in, the, streets, of, paris, during, the, night, of, january, 6, 1649, mazarin, secretly, took, the, young, louis, xiv, anne, of, austria, and, the, court, to, the, safety, of, the, ch, teau, de, saint, germain, en, laye, just, west, of, paris, mazarin, then, set, to, work, intriguing, to, divide, the, different, factions, of, the, fronde, his, goal, was, to, separate, the, members, of, the, parlement, and, the, more, radical, parisian, street, demonstrators, who, were, united, only, by, their, dislike, of, mazarin, and, anne, of, austria, as, soon, as, the, war, was, concluded, he, brought, cond, and, his, army, back, to, paris, and, placed, the, city, under, blockade, he, then, persuaded, the, parlement, that, they, had, more, to, fear, from, an, uprising, of, the, parisiens, than, they, did, from, him, on, 14, march, 1649, mazarin, accepted, many, of, the, reforms, demanded, by, the, parlement, in, return, the, parlement, supporters, laid, down, their, weapons, and, allowed, anne, of, austria, the, young, louis, xiv, and, mazarin, to, return, to, paris, the, parlement, accepted, mazarin, and, his, government, but, the, fronde, was, still, not, finished, many, frondeurs, were, unhappy, with, the, compromise, reached, in, 1649, once, in, paris, cond, made, endless, demands, on, anne, of, austria, until, she, finally, angrily, dismissed, him, one, of, the, other, leaders, of, the, fronde, jean, fran, ois, paul, de, gondi, soon, persuaded, cond, to, join, him, in, bringing, down, both, mazarin, and, anne, of, austria, mazarin, had, an, excellent, network, of, agents, and, immediately, learned, of, the, plot, on, 18, january, 1650, mazarin, had, cond, cond, s, brother, armand, de, bourbon, prince, de, conti, and, his, brother, in, law, henri, ii, d, orl, ans, duc, de, longueville, arrested, the, agreements, of, 1649, had, brought, peace, to, paris, but, the, unrest, of, the, fronde, continued, in, other, parts, of, france, opponents, of, mazarin, disrupted, tax, collection, and, administration, as, the, rebellion, grew, mazarin, observed, that, the, rebels, were, only, united, in, opposition, to, him, he, decided, it, was, wisest, to, resign, his, position, and, leave, france, while, he, could, he, had, cond, freed, from, prison, and, after, a, long, journey, to, different, cities, settled, in, br, hl, near, cologne, as, the, guest, of, the, archbishop, elector, of, cologne, from, germany, he, sent, daily, instructions, to, anne, of, austria, and, to, his, agents, in, france, the, strategy, was, to, sow, distrust, among, the, different, factions, of, the, fronde, mazarin, s, instructions, were, carried, out, meticulously, by, anne, of, austria, his, intrigues, succeeded, in, preventing, the, proposed, marriage, between, one, of, the, leading, frondeurs, the, armand, de, bourbon, prince, of, conti, with, princess, charlotte, marie, of, lorraine, mademoiselle, de, chevreuse, another, of, his, principal, enemies, in, paris, he, was, greatly, aided, by, the, political, ineptitude, of, cond, who, offended, many, of, his, natural, allies, mazarin, urged, anne, of, austria, to, bring, him, back, to, paris, as, soon, as, possible, to, correct, the, greatest, attack, ever, made, against, the, royal, authority, once, back, in, paris, mazarin, soon, made, an, alliance, with, his, old, enemy, cardinal, jean, fran, ois, paul, de, gondi, cond, departed, to, bordeaux, to, gather, reinforcements, he, raised, an, army, of, spanish, and, french, soldiers, and, marched, on, paris, arriving, on, 2, july, the, soldiers, loyal, to, the, queen, commanded, by, turenne, were, waiting, and, trapped, cond, s, army, against, the, walls, of, paris, an, ally, of, cond, the, grande, mademoiselle, ordered, the, gates, of, the, city, opened, to, rescue, cond, s, army, the, battle, was, witnessed, from, the, hills, of, charonne, by, the, young, louis, xiv, as, soon, as, cond, s, soldiers, entered, paris, he, demanded, an, immediate, purge, of, mazarin, s, supporters, riots, broke, out, around, the, bastille, and, were, suppressed, with, great, difficulty, the, presidents, of, the, parlement, now, allies, of, mazarin, demanded, that, the, violence, be, stopped, and, that, cond, take, his, army, out, of, paris, reluctantly, cond, left, the, city, going, to, the, spanish, netherlands, pursued, by, turenne, louis, xiv, now, of, age, to, claim, his, throne, re, entered, paris, in, october, 1652, accompanied, by, his, mother, and, by, turenne, mazarin, had, to, wait, longer, to, make, his, return, which, was, carefully, orchestrated, with, his, help, the, parlement, de, paris, was, first, transferred, by, anne, of, austria, from, paris, to, pontoise, to, see, how, many, members, would, accept, her, authority, a, majority, appeared, at, the, meeting, following, the, prepared, plan, the, parlement, respectfully, asked, that, mazarin, be, dismissed, and, anne, of, austria, agreed, mazarin, knowing, this, was, the, plan, accepted, this, decision, and, waited, a, respectful, time, in, exile, he, made, his, return, to, paris, in, february, 1653, he, was, welcomed, with, a, triumphal, banquet, at, the, hotel, de, ville, where, crowds, earlier, had, demanded, his, downfall, once, he, was, restored, to, power, mazarin, began, arranging, for, his, nieces, known, as, the, mazarinettes, to, marry, powerful, french, and, italian, noblemen, in, order, to, entice, the, prospective, grooms, to, marry, them, despite, their, lower, rank, mazarin, provided, large, dowries, among, his, seven, nieces, laura, mancini, and, anne, marie, martinozzi, married, into, the, royal, house, of, bourbon, olympia, mancini, married, into, the, house, of, savoy, and, laura, martinozzi, married, duke, alfonso, iv, d, este, of, modena, finding, money, was, a, primary, preoccupation, for, mazarin, throughout, his, entire, time, as, first, minister, his, new, taxes, on, parisians, and, the, nobility, had, provoked, the, first, fronde, but, the, end, of, the, fronde, did, not, resolve, the, problem, the, government, had, borrowed, huge, amounts, to, finance, the, campaigns, against, the, first, fronde, and, against, cond, and, also, had, to, pay, for, the, continual, travels, of, the, regent, and, the, young, king, and, the, elaborate, festivities, parades, and, cavalcades, that, accompanied, their, travel, and, every, major, event, the, royal, budget, for, 1653, was, about, 109, million, livres, which, amounted, to, eight, hundred, tons, of, silver, or, sixty, tons, of, gold, expenditures, were, the, greatest, between, 1656, and, 1659, twenty, seven, agreements, were, made, with, bankers, who, loaned, the, government, 98, million, livres, to, supplement, the, money, collected, through, ordinary, taxes, following, the, death, of, his, first, finance, minister, la, vieuville, on, 2, february, 1653, mazarin, chose, a, new, minister, nicolas, fouquet, at, the, age, of, twenty, five, fouquet, had, inherited, a, very, large, fortune, after, the, death, of, his, young, first, wife, and, an, even, greater, fortune, when, he, married, the, second, time, to, marie, madeleine, de, castille, whose, family, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, in, europe, fouquet, began, as, a, master, of, receipts, at, age, twenty, then, an, intendant, to, the, army, then, procuror, general, for, the, parlement, of, paris, at, the, age, of, thirty, five, through, his, family, connections, fouquet, had, amassed, a, fortune, of, three, to, four, million, livres, one, of, the, reasons, for, fouquet, s, rapid, rise, was, his, willingness, to, lend, very, large, sums, to, mazarin, for, his, various, projects, in, november, 1657, mazarin, needed, 11, 8, million, livres, to, pay, the, army, of, the, north, fouquet, drawing, upon, his, wealthy, relatives, was, able, to, provide, the, money, in, 1659, he, provided, another, loan, of, five, million, livres, one, effect, of, the, enormous, amount, of, money, in, the, market, during, the, period, of, the, regency, of, anne, of, austria, and, mazarin, was, a, decline, in, the, value, of, the, livre, tournois, the, french, royal, unit, of, account, lost, twenty, percent, of, its, value, against, the, gold, florentine, florin, coin, however, without, the, money, lent, by, fouquet, and, other, aristocratic, financiers, louis, xiv, could, never, have, accomplished, his, early, military, and, diplomatic, successes, the, great, rival, of, fouquet, was, jean, baptiste, colbert, who, was, also, recommended, to, louis, xiv, and, brought, into, the, government, by, mazarin, soon, after, he, became, an, assistant, to, mazarin, he, wrote, a, m, moire, to, mazarin, claiming, that, of, the, taxes, paid, by, the, people, not, one, half, reached, the, king, the, paper, also, accused, fouquet, of, using, royal, funds, for, his, own, enrichment, mazarin, did, not, defend, fouquet, shortly, before, his, own, death, he, agreed, that, fouquet, had, to, go, shortly, after, mazarin, s, death, fouquet, was, accused, by, colbert, of, misuse, of, state, funds, his, property, was, confiscated, and, he, was, put, into, prison, until, his, death, with, colbert, eventually, taking, his, place, in, 1645, marie, louise, gonzaga, the, aunt, of, charles, gonzaga, duke, of, mantua, had, been, granted, in, marriage, to, w, adys, aw, iv, of, poland, she, and, her, family, did, not, have, enough, money, to, pay, the, agreed, upon, dowry, of, 2, 100, 000, livres, as, a, result, they, went, deeply, in, debt, to, louis, xiv, and, their, duchies, of, mayenne, nevers, and, rethel, were, mortgaged, for, this, purpose, the, negotiations, begun, by, chancellor, s, guier, were, taken, over, by, mazarin, probably, because, s, guier, was, unable, to, put, together, enough, money, through, various, machinations, mazarin, and, colbert, were, eventually, able, to, force, charles, to, pay, off, these, debts, by, selling, to, mazarin, in, 1654, the, duchy, of, mayenne, for, 756, 000, livres, and, in, 1659, that, of, nevers, valued, at, 1, 800, 000, livres, at, a, discount, of, 1, 534, 675, livres, as, well, as, the, duchies, of, donzy, and, rethel, thus, on, 18, october, 1660, less, than, five, months, before, his, death, mazarin, was, confirmed, by, letters, patent, issued, by, the, young, louis, xiv, as, duke, and, peer, of, france, the, personal, fortune, of, mazarin, at, the, time, of, his, death, was, immense, amounting, to, 35, million, livres, not, counting, the, sums, he, left, to, his, nieces, it, exceeded, the, second, greatest, personal, fortune, of, the, century, that, of, richelieu, worth, some, 20, million, livres, about, one, third, of, the, personal, fortune, of, mazarin, came, from, some, twenty, one, abbeys, around, france, each, of, which, paid, him, an, annual, share, of, their, revenue, unlike, members, of, the, nobility, he, did, not, have, any, large, estates, his, only, real, estate, was, the, palace, in, paris, which, he, purchased, in, 1649, and, added, several, surrounding, houses, it, was, valued, at, 1, 2, million, livres, thirty, seven, percent, of, his, fortune, was, in, easily, transportable, jewels, and, cash, within, the, ebony, cabinets, of, his, rooms, at, the, louvre, his, heirs, found, 450, pearls, of, high, quality, plus, quantities, of, gold, chains, and, crosses, and, rings, with, precious, stones, altogether, adding, another, 400, 000, livres, he, left, to, his, family, jewels, worth, an, estimated, 2, 5, million, livres, and, gave, a, collection, of, diamonds, worth, 50, 000, livres, to, the, new, queen, and, a, 14, carat, diamond, called, the, rose, of, england, valued, at, 73, 000, livres, to, the, queen, mother, the, most, valuable, legacies, of, all, including, a, set, of, eighteen, diamonds, known, as, the, mazarins, worth, two, million, livres, were, given, to, the, young, louis, xiv, mazarin, was,

the, inventory, of, his, art, collection, at, the, mazarin, palace, recorded, 858, paintings, 128, statues, 185, busts, plus, 150, carpets, 514, pieces, of, jewelry, and, fine, silver, and, 317, precious, stones, not, counting, the, famous, mazarin, diamonds, which, he, left, to, louis, xiv, his, collection, included, works, by, most, of, the, major, french, and, italian, artists, of, his, time, and, before, going, back, to, the, renaissance, his, acquisitions, included, works, by, poussin, rubens, corregio, van, dyck, titian, and, many, others, as, well, as, the, famous, portrait, of, baldassare, castiglione, by, raphael, which, had, belonged, to, charles, i, of, england, and, had, been, bought, by, richelieu, just, before, his, death, he, visited, his, gallery, for, the, last, time, with, his, deputy, brienne, and, told, him, ah, my, poor, friend, i, must, leave, all, this, farewell, dear, paintings, which, cost, me, so, much, and, which, i, so, much, loved, many, of, the, paintings, he, owned, are, now, in, the, louvre, the, palais, mazarin, mazarin, palace, was, created, by, mazarin, beginning, in, 1643, soon, after, he, became, first, minister, when, he, rented, four, adjacent, h, tels, on, the, north, side, of, the, rue, neuve, des, petits, champs, between, the, rue, vivienne, to, the, east, and, the, rue, de, richelieu, on, the, west, and, across, from, the, palais, royal, which, was, the, king, s, residence, he, commissioned, fran, ois, mansart, to, add, a, garden, wing, with, two, superimposed, galleries, running, north, from, the, west, end, of, the, easternmost, building, the, h, tel, tubeuf, where, he, could, display, his, art, between, 1645, and, 1647, he, commissioned, the, italian, painter, giovanni, francesco, romanelli, to, create, scenes, from, the, works, of, ovid, on, the, ceiling, of, the, upper, gallery, although, much, modified, now, known, as, the, galerie, mazarine, in, 1721, the, palais, mazarin, became, the, site, of, the, king, s, library, biblioth, que, du, roi, now, the, richelieu, site, of, the, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, mazarin, spent, little, time, in, his, palace, he, lived, most, of, the, time, in, the, palais, royal, when, louis, xiv, was, in, residence, there, or, in, the, louvre, near, the, end, of, his, life, he, resided, in, the, ch, teau, de, vincennes, where, he, decorated, a, suite, of, rooms, he, also, had, the, moats, of, the, chateau, turned, into, a, kind, of, zoo, with, lions, tigers, bears, and, other, exotic, animals, for, the, amusement, of, the, young, king, mazarin, also, played, an, important, role, in, bringing, italian, music, to, paris, before, mazarin, italian, opera, was, very, little, known, or, appreciated, in, paris, louis, xiii, catherine, de, medici, and, marie, de, medici, had, all, brought, italian, musicians, to, paris, but, mazarin, did, it, more, systematically, and, on, a, much, larger, scale, after, his, arrival, as, a, minister, in, 1643, he, invited, the, famous, soprano, leonora, baroni, and, the, castrato, atto, melani, melani, doubled, as, a, diplomat, mazarin, sent, him, on, several, secret, missions, to, other, courts, in, europe, due, to, mazarin, s, efforts, seven, italian, operas, were, performed, in, paris, between, 1645, and, 1662, in, 1645, mazarin, brought, to, paris, the, famous, scenery, designer, giacomo, torelli, who, staged, sacrati, s, opera, la, finta, pazza, in, 1647, for, carnaval, he, staged, a, lavish, production, of, the, premiere, of, orfeo, by, luigi, rossi, later, on, torelli, became, involved, more, in, the, ballet, de, cour, than, in, opera, reflecting, the, passion, of, the, king, for, dancing, torelli, s, career, in, france, came, to, a, definitive, end, in, 1661, when, he, worked, on, sets, for, moli, re, s, les, f, cheux, presented, by, nicholas, fouquet, as, part, of, his, grand, f, te, at, vaux, le, vicomte, in, honor, of, the, king, the, overly, ostentatious, display, which, ultimately, led, to, fouquet, s, imprisonment, mazarin, was, also, a, famous, collector, of, books, in, 1646, he, brought, to, paris, his, collection, of, nine, thousand, volumes, which, he, installed, in, his, residence, it, was, the, second, largest, library, in, paris, second, only, to, the, library, of, the, king, however, when, mazarin, was, forced, to, leave, paris, during, the, fronde, his, library, was, seized, by, the, fronde, leaders, and, was, dispersed, he, then, began, a, second, library, with, what, was, left, of, the, first, the, library, grew, to, over, 25, 000, volumes, and, was, open, to, all, scholars, after, 1643, it, is, recognized, as, the, first, true, public, library, in, france, in, his, will, he, gave, his, library, to, the, coll, ge, des, quatre, nations, which, he, had, founded, in, 1661, the, original, bookcases, of, his, library, were, transferred, to, the, reading, room, of, the, college, of, quatre, nations, when, it, was, built, from, the, eighth, birthday, of, the, young, louis, xiv, mazarin, took, the, title, superintendent, of, the, royal, education, and, managed, every, aspect, of, the, young, king, s, studies, all, of, the, king, s, activities, were, governed, and, scheduled, by, mazarin, his, time, of, rising, his, prayers, his, physical, exercise, paume, fencing, and, dance, followed, by, a, morning, lesson, in, politics, with, mazarin, himself, in, the, afternoons, he, was, charged, to, write, an, essay, each, day, for, mazarin, on, what, he, had, learned, the, education, he, gave, louis, was, purely, practical, not, theoretical, among, other, topics, he, instructed, the, king, in, the, fine, art, of, dissimulation, or, lying, when, needed, and, always, when, making, an, agreement, to, leave, a, way, out, beginning, in, 1659, as, the, king, reached, the, age, of, twenty, one, and, mazarin, approached, the, end, of, his, life, he, wrote, a, series, of, guidelines, in, political, affairs, for, the, king, when, the, king, set, off, on, his, journey, to, spain, to, be, married, mazarin, wrote, to, him, remember, i, ask, you, what, i, have, had, the, honor, to, tell, you, when, you, asked, me, the, way, to, take, to, become, a, great, king, it, is, necessary, to, begin, by, making, the, greatest, efforts, to, not, be, dominated, by, any, passion, because, otherwise, if, any, misfortune, arrives, regardless, of, what, good, will, you, have, you, will, not, be, able, to, do, what, has, to, be, done, despite, mazarin, s, instructions, louis, xiv, continued, to, correspond, with, mazarin, s, niece, marie, with, the, tacit, collusion, of, his, mother, mazarin, immediately, adopted, a, stricter, tone, god, established, kings, for, watching, over, the, well, being, safety, and, peace, of, their, subjects, and, not, to, sacrifice, this, well, being, and, safety, for, their, personal, passions, you, must, remember, your, responsibilities, to, god, for, your, actions, and, for, your, safety, and, to, the, world, for, the, support, of, your, glory, and, your, reputation, mazarin, also, threatened, to, depart, france, with, his, family, if, the, king, did, not, agree, to, stop, communicating, with, marie, in, response, louis, wrote, a, new, letter, to, his, mother, promising, that, henceforth, he, would, forget, marie, and, concentrate, exclusively, on, the, great,
