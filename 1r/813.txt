theologian, jurist, statesman, poet, and, playwright, a, teenage, prodigy, he, was, born, in, delft, and, studied, at, leiden, university, he, was, imprisoned, in, loevestein, castle, for, his, involvement, in, the, controversies, over, religious, policy, of, the, dutch, republic, but, escaped, hidden, in, a, chest, of, books, that, was, regularly, brought, to, him, and, was, transported, to, gorinchem, grotius, wrote, most, of, his, major, works, in, exile, in, france, grotius, was, a, major, figure, in, the, fields, of, philosophy, political, theory, and, law, during, the, 16th, and, 17th, centuries, along, with, the, earlier, works, of, francisco, de, vitoria, and, alberico, gentili, his, writings, laid, the, foundations, for, international, law, based, on, natural, law, in, its, protestant, side, two, of, his, books, have, had, a, lasting, impact, in, the, field, of, international, law, de, jure, belli, ac, pacis, on, the, law, of, war, and, peace, dedicated, to, louis, xiii, of, france, and, the, mare, liberum, the, free, seas, for, which, grotius, has, been, called, the, father, of, international, law, grotius, has, also, contributed, significantly, to, the, evolution, of, the, notion, of, rights, before, him, rights, were, above, all, perceived, as, attached, to, objects, after, him, they, are, seen, as, belonging, to, persons, as, the, expression, of, an, ability, to, act, or, as, a, means, of, realizing, something, peter, borschberg, suggests, that, grotius, was, significantly, influenced, by, francisco, de, vitoria, and, the, school, of, salamanca, in, spain, who, supported, the, idea, that, the, sovereignty, of, a, nation, does, not, lie, simply, in, a, ruler, through, god, s, will, but, originates, in, its, people, who, agree, to, confer, such, authority, upon, a, ruler, it, is, also, thought, that, grotius, was, not, the, first, to, formulate, the, international, society, doctrine, but, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, define, expressly, the, idea, of, one, society, of, states, governed, not, by, force, or, warfare, but, by, actual, laws, and, mutual, agreement, to, enforce, those, laws, as, hedley, bull, declared, in, 1990, the, idea, of, international, society, which, grotius, propounded, was, given, concrete, expression, in, the, peace, of, westphalia, and, grotius, may, be, considered, the, intellectual, father, of, this, first, general, peace, settlement, of, modern, times, additionally, his, contributions, to, arminian, theology, helped, provide, the, seeds, for, later, arminian, based, movements, such, as, methodism, and, pentecostalism, grotius, is, acknowledged, as, a, significant, figure, in, the, arminian, calvinist, debate, because, of, his, theological, underpinning, of, free, trade, he, is, also, considered, an, economic, theologist, after, fading, over, time, the, influence, of, grotius, s, ideas, revived, in, the, 20th, century, following, the, first, world, war, born, in, delft, during, the, dutch, revolt, grotius, was, the, first, child, of, jan, cornets, de, groot, and, alida, van, overschie, his, father, was, a, man, of, learning, once, having, studied, with, the, eminent, justus, lipsius, at, leiden, university, as, well, as, of, political, distinction, his, family, was, considered, delft, patrician, as, his, ancestors, played, an, important, role, in, local, government, since, the, 13th, century, jan, de, groot, was, also, translator, of, archimedes, and, friend, of, ludolph, van, ceulen, he, groomed, his, son, from, an, early, age, in, a, traditional, humanist, and, aristotelian, education, a, prodigious, learner, grotius, entered, leiden, university, when, he, was, just, eleven, years, old, there, he, studied, with, some, of, the, most, acclaimed, intellectuals, in, northern, europe, including, franciscus, junius, joseph, justus, scaliger, and, rudolph, snellius, at, age, 16, 1599, he, published, his, first, book, a, scholarly, edition, of, the, late, antique, author, martianus, capella, s, work, on, the, seven, liberal, arts, martiani, minei, felicis, capell, carthaginiensis, viri, proconsularis, satyricon, it, remained, a, reference, for, several, centuries, in, 1598, at, the, age, of, 15, years, he, accompanied, johan, van, oldenbarnevelt, to, a, diplomatic, mission, in, paris, on, this, occasion, the, king, henri, iv, of, france, would, have, presented, grotius, to, his, court, as, the, miracle, of, holland, during, his, stay, in, france, he, passed, or, bought, a, law, degree, from, the, university, of, orleans, in, holland, grotius, earned, an, appointment, as, advocate, to, the, hague, in, 1599, and, then, as, official, historiographer, for, the, states, of, holland, in, 1601, it, was, on, this, date, that, the, states, of, holland, requested, from, grotius, an, account, of, the, united, provinces, revolt, against, spain, grotius, is, indeed, contemporary, with, the, eighty, years, war, between, spain, and, the, netherlands, the, resulting, work, entitled, annales, et, historiae, de, rebus, belgicis, describing, the, period, from, 1559, to, 1609, was, written, in, the, style, of, the, roman, historian, tacitus, and, was, first, finished, in, 1612, the, states, however, did, not, publish, it, possibly, because, of, the, way, the, work, resonated, with, the, politico, religious, tensions, within, the, dutch, republic, see, below, his, first, occasion, to, write, systematically, on, issues, of, international, justice, came, in, 1604, when, he, became, involved, in, the, legal, proceedings, following, the, seizure, by, dutch, merchants, of, a, portuguese, carrack, and, its, cargo, in, the, singapore, strait, throughout, his, life, grotius, wrote, a, variety, of, philological, theological, and, politico, theological, works, in, 1608, he, married, maria, van, reigersberch, they, had, three, daughters, and, four, sons, the, dutch, were, at, war, with, spain, although, portugal, was, closely, allied, with, spain, it, was, not, yet, at, war, with, the, dutch, near, the, start, of, the, war, grotius, s, cousin, captain, jacob, van, heemskerk, captured, a, loaded, portuguese, carrack, merchant, ship, santa, catarina, off, present, day, singapore, in, 1603, heemskerk, was, employed, with, the, united, amsterdam, company, part, of, the, dutch, east, india, company, and, though, he, did, not, have, authorization, from, the, company, or, the, government, to, initiate, the, use, of, force, many, shareholders, were, eager, to, accept, the, riches, that, he, brought, back, to, them, not, only, was, the, legality, of, keeping, the, prize, questionable, under, dutch, statute, but, a, faction, of, shareholders, mostly, mennonite, in, the, company, also, objected, to, the, forceful, seizure, on, moral, grounds, and, of, course, the, portuguese, demanded, the, return, of, their, cargo, the, scandal, led, to, a, public, judicial, hearing, and, a, wider, campaign, to, sway, public, and, international, opinion, it, was, in, this, wider, context, that, representatives, of, the, company, called, upon, grotius, to, draft, a, polemical, defence, of, the, seizure, the, result, of, grotius, efforts, in, 1604, 05, was, a, long, theory, laden, treatise, that, he, provisionally, entitled, de, indis, on, the, indies, grotius, sought, to, ground, his, defense, of, the, seizure, in, terms, of, the, natural, principles, of, justice, in, this, he, had, cast, a, net, much, wider, than, the, case, at, hand, his, interest, was, in, the, source, and, ground, of, war, s, lawfulness, in, general, the, treatise, was, never, published, in, full, during, grotius, lifetime, perhaps, because, the, court, ruling, in, favor, of, the, company, preempted, the, need, to, garner, public, support, in, the, free, sea, mare, liberum, published, 1609, grotius, formulated, the, new, principle, that, the, sea, was, international, territory, and, all, nations, were, free, to, use, it, for, seafaring, trade, grotius, by, claiming, free, seas, freedom, of, the, seas, provided, suitable, ideological, justification, for, the, dutch, breaking, up, of, various, trade, monopolies, through, its, formidable, naval, power, england, competing, fiercely, with, the, dutch, for, domination, of, world, trade, opposed, this, idea, and, claimed, in, john, selden, s, mare, clausum, the, closed, sea, that, the, dominion, of, the, british, sea, or, that, which, incompasseth, the, isle, of, great, britain, is, and, ever, hath, been, a, part, or, appendant, of, the, empire, of, that, island, it, is, generally, assumed, that, grotius, first, propounded, the, principle, of, freedom, of, the, seas, although, all, countries, in, the, indian, ocean, and, other, asian, seas, accepted, the, right, of, unobstructed, navigation, long, before, grotius, wrote, his, de, jure, praedae, on, the, law, of, spoils, in, the, year, of, 1604, additionally, 16th, century, spanish, theologian, francisco, de, vitoria, had, postulated, the, idea, of, freedom, of, the, seas, in, a, more, rudimentary, fashion, under, the, principles, of, jus, gentium, grotius, s, notion, of, the, freedom, of, the, seas, would, persist, until, the, mid, 20th, century, and, it, continues, to, be, applied, even, to, this, day, for, much, of, the, high, seas, though, the, application, of, the, concept, and, the, scope, of, its, reach, is, changing, aided, by, his, continued, association, with, van, oldenbarnevelt, grotius, made, considerable, advances, in, his, political, career, being, retained, as, oldenbarnevelt, s, resident, advisor, in, 1605, advocate, general, of, the, fisc, of, holland, zeeland, and, friesland, in, 1607, and, then, as, pensionary, of, rotterdam, the, equivalent, of, a, mayoral, office, in, 1613, also, in, 1613, following, the, capture, of, two, dutch, ships, by, the, british, he, was, sent, on, a, mission, to, london, a, mission, tailored, to, a, man, who, wrote, mare, liberum, in, 1609, however, it, was, opposed, by, the, english, by, reason, of, force, and, he, didn, t, obtain, the, return, of, the, boats, in, these, years, a, great, theological, controversy, broke, out, between, the, chair, of, theology, at, leiden, jacobus, arminius, and, his, followers, who, are, called, arminians, or, remonstrants, and, the, strongly, calvinist, theologian, franciscus, gomarus, whose, supporters, are, termed, gomarists, or, counter, remonstrants, leiden, university, was, under, the, authority, of, the, states, of, holland, they, were, responsible, among, other, things, for, the, policy, concerning, appointments, at, this, institution, which, was, governed, in, their, name, by, a, board, of, curators, and, in, the, final, instance, the, states, were, responsible, for, dealing, with, any, cases, of, heterodoxy, among, the, professors, the, domestic, dissension, resulting, over, arminius, professorship, was, overshadowed, by, the, continuing, war, with, spain, and, the, professor, died, in, 1609, on, the, eve, of, the, twelve, years, truce, the, new, peace, would, move, the, people, s, focus, to, the, controversy, and, arminius, followers, grotius, played, a, decisive, part, in, this, politico, religious, conflict, between, the, remonstrants, supporters, of, religious, tolerance, and, the, orthodox, calvinists, or, counter, remonstrants, the, controversy, expanded, when, the, remonstrant, theologian, conrad, vorstius, was, appointed, to, replace, jacobus, arminius, as, the, theology, chair, at, leiden, vorstius, was, soon, seen, by, counter, remonstrants, as, moving, beyond, the, teachings, of, arminius, into, socinianism, and, he, was, accused, of, teaching, irreligion, leading, the, call, for, vorstius, removal, was, theology, professor, sibrandus, lubbertus, on, the, other, side, johannes, wtenbogaert, a, remonstrant, leader, and, johan, van, oldenbarnevelt, grand, pensionary, of, holland, had, strongly, promoted, the, appointment, of, vorstius, and, began, to, defend, their, actions, gomarus, resigned, his, professorship, at, leyden, in, protest, that, vorstius, was, not, removed, the, counter, remonstrants, were, also, supported, in, their, opposition, by, king, james, i, of, england, who, thundered, loudly, against, the, leyden, nomination, and, gaudily, depicted, vorstius, as, a, horrid, heretic, he, ordered, his, books, to, be, publicly, burnt, in, london, cambridge, and, oxford, and, he, exerted, continual, pressure, through, his, ambassador, in, the, hague, ralph, winwood, to, get, the, appointment, cancelled, james, began, to, shift, his, confidence, from, oldenbarnevelt, towards, maurice, grotius, joined, the, controversy, by, defending, the, civil, authorities, power, to, appoint, independently, of, the, wishes, of, religious, authorities, whomever, they, wished, to, a, university, s, faculty, he, did, this, by, writing, ordinum, pietas, a, pamphlet, directed, against, an, opponent, the, calvinist, franeker, professor, lubbertus, it, was, ordered, by, grotius, masters, the, states, of, holland, and, thus, written, for, the, occasion, though, grotius, may, already, have, had, plans, for, such, a, book, the, work, is, twenty, seven, pages, long, is, polemical, and, acrimonious, and, only, two, thirds, of, it, speaks, directly, about, ecclesiastical, politics, mainly, of, synods, and, offices, the, work, met, with, a, violent, reaction, from, the, counter, remonstrants, and, it, might, be, said, that, all, grotius, next, works, until, his, arrest, in, 1618, form, a, vain, attempt, to, repair, the, damage, done, by, this, book, grotius, would, later, write, de, satisfactione, aiming, at, proving, that, the, arminians, are, far, from, being, socinians, led, by, oldenbarnevelt, the, states, of, holland, took, an, official, position, of, religious, toleration, towards, remonstrants, and, counter, remonstrants, grotius, who, acted, during, the, controversy, first, as, attorney, general, of, holland, and, later, as, a, member, of, the, committee, of, counsellors, was, eventually, asked, to, draft, an, edict, to, express, the, policy, of, toleration, this, edict, decretum, pro, pace, ecclesiarum, was, completed, in, late, 1613, or, early, 1614, the, edict, put, into, practice, a, view, that, grotius, had, been, developing, in, his, writings, on, church, and, state, see, erastianism, that, only, the, basic, tenets, necessary, for, undergirding, civil, order, e, g, the, existence, of, god, and, his, providence, ought, to, be, enforced, while, differences, on, obscure, theological, doctrines, should, be, left, to, private, conscience, the, edict, imposing, moderation, and, toleration, on, the, ministry, was, backed, up, by, grotius, with, thirty, one, pages, of, quotations, mainly, dealing, with, the, five, remonstrant, articles, in, response, to, grotius, ordinum, pietas, professor, lubbertus, published, responsio, ad, pietatem, hugonis, grotii, in, 1614, later, that, year, grotius, anonymously, published, bona, fides, sibrandi, lubberti, in, response, to, lubbertus, jacobus, trigland, joined, lubberdus, in, expressing, the, view, that, tolerance, in, matters, of, doctrine, was, inadmissible, and, in, his, 1615, works, den, recht, gematigden, christen, ofte, vande, waere, moderatie, and, advys, over, een, concept, van, moderatie, trigland, denounced, grotius, stance, in, late, 1615, when, middelburg, professor, antonius, walaeus, published, het, ampt, der, kerckendienaren, a, response, to, johannes, wtenbogaert, s, 1610, tractaet, van, t, ampt, ende, authoriteit, eener, hoogher, christelijcke, overheid, in, kerckelijkcke, zaken, he, sent, grotius, a, copy, out, of, friendship, this, was, a, work, on, the, relationship, between, ecclesiastical, and, secular, government, from, the, moderate, counter, remonstrant, viewpoint, in, early, 1616, grotius, also, received, the, 36, page, letter, championing, a, remonstrant, view, dissertatio, epistolica, de, iure, magistratus, in, rebus, ecclesiasticis, from, his, friend, gerardus, vossius, the, letter, was, a, general, introduction, on, in, tolerance, mainly, on, the, subject, of, predestination, and, the, sacrament, an, extensive, detailed, and, generally, unfavourable, review, of, walaeus, ampt, stuffed, with, references, to, ancient, and, modern, authorities, when, grotius, wrote, asking, for, some, notes, he, received, a, treasure, house, of, ecclesiastical, history, offering, ammunition, to, grotius, who, gratefully, accepted, it, around, this, time, april, 1616, grotius, went, to, amsterdam, as, part, of, his, official, duties, trying, to, persuade, the, civil, authorities, there, to, join, holland, s, majority, view, about, church, politics, in, early, 1617, grotius, debated, the, question, of, giving, counter, remonstrants, the, chance, to, preach, in, the, kloosterkerk, in, the, hague, which, had, been, closed, during, this, time, lawsuits, were, brought, against, the, states, of, holland, by, counter, remonstrant, ministers, and, riots, over, the, controversy, broke, out, in, amsterdam, as, the, conflict, between, civil, and, religious, authorities, escalated, in, order, to, maintain, civil, order, oldenbarnevelt, eventually, proposed, that, local, authorities, be, given, the, power, to, raise, troops, the, sharp, resolution, of, august, 4, 1617, such, a, measure, undermined, the, unity, of, the, republic, s, military, force, the, very, same, reason, spain, had, managed, to, retake, so, much, lost, territory, in, the, 1580s, something, the, captain, general, of, the, republic, maurice, of, nassau, prince, of, orange, could, not, allow, with, the, treaty, nearing, its, end, maurice, seized, the, opportunity, to, solidify, the, preeminence, of, the, gomarists, whom, he, had, supported, and, to, eliminate, the, nuisance, he, perceived, in, oldenbarnevelt, the, latter, had, previously, brokered, the, twelve, years, truce, with, spain, in, 1609, against, maurice, s, wishes, during, this, time, grotius, made, another, attempt, to, address, ecclesiastical, politics, by, completing, de, imperio, summarum, potestatum, circa, sacra, on, the, relations, between, the, religious, and, secular, authorities, grotius, had, even, cherished, hopes, that, publication, of, this, book, would, turn, the, tide, and, bring, back, peace, to, church, and, state, the, conflict, between, maurice, and, the, states, of, holland, led, by, oldenbarnevelt, and, grotius, about, the, sharp, resolution, and, holland, s, refusal, to, allow, a, national, synod, came, to, a, head, in, july, 1619, when, a, majority, in, the, states, general, authorized, maurice, to, disband, the, auxiliary, troops, in, utrecht, grotius, went, on, a, mission, to, the, states, of, utrecht, to, stiffen, their, resistance, against, this, move, but, maurice, prevailed, the, states, general, then, authorized, him, to, arrest, oldenbarnevelt, grotius, and, rombout, hogerbeets, on, 29, august, 1618, they, were, tried, by, a, court, of, delegated, judges, from, the, states, general, van, oldenbarnevelt, was, sentenced, to, death, and, was, beheaded, in, 1619, grotius, was, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, and, transferred, to, loevestein, castle, from, his, imprisonment, in, loevestein, grotius, made, a, written, justification, of, his, position, as, to, my, views, on, the, power, of, the, christian, authorities, in, ecclesiastical, matters, i, refer, to, my, booklet, de, pietate, ordinum, hollandiae, and, especially, to, an, unpublished, book, de, imperio, summarum, potestatum, circa, sacra, where, i, have, treated, the, matter, in, more, detail, i, may, summarize, my, feelings, thus, that, the, authorities, should, scrutinize, god, s, word, so, thoroughly, as, to, be, certain, to, impose, nothing, which, is, against, it, if, they, act, in, this, way, they, shall, in, good, conscience, have, control, of, the, public, churches, and, public, worship, but, without, persecuting, those, who, err, from, the, right, way, because, this, stripped, church, officials, of, any, power, some, of, their, members, such, as, johannes, althusius, in, a, letter, to, lubbertus, declared, grotius, ideas, diabolical, in, 1621, with, the, help, of, his, wife, and, his, maidservant, elsje, van, houwening, grotius, managed, to, escape, the, castle, in, a, book, chest, and, fled, to, paris, in, the, netherlands, today, he, is, mainly, famous, for, this, daring, escape, both, the, rijksmuseum, in, amsterdam, and, the, museum, het, prinsenhof, in, delft, claim, to, have, the, original, book, chest, in, their, collection, grotius, then, fled, to, paris, where, the, authorities, granted, him, an, annual, royal, pension, grotius, lived, in, france, almost, continuously, from, 1621, to, 1644, his, stay, coincides, with, the, period, 1624, 1642, during, which, the, cardinal, richelieu, led, france, under, the, authority, of, louis, xiii, in, france, in, 1625, grotius, published, his, most, famous, book, de, jure, belli, ac, pacis, dedicated, to, louis, xiii, of, france, while, in, paris, grotius, set, about, rendering, into, latin, prose, a, work, which, he, had, originally, written, as, dutch, verse, in, prison, providing, rudimentary, yet, systematic, arguments, for, the, truth, of, christianity, the, dutch, poem, bewijs, van, den, waren, godsdienst, was, published, in, 1622, the, latin, treatise, in, 1627, under, the, title, de, veritate, religionis, christianae, in, 1631, he, tried, to, return, to, holland, but, the, authorities, remained, hostile, to, him, he, moved, to, hamburg, in, 1632, but, as, early, as, 1634, the, swedes, a, european, superpower, sent, him, to, paris, as, ambassador, he, remained, ten, years, in, this, position, where, he, had, the, mission, to, negotiate, for, sweden, the, end, of, the, thirty, years, war, during, this, period, he, had, been, interested, in, the, unity, of, christians, and, published, many, texts, that, would, posthumously, 1679, be, published, under, the, title, of, opera, omnia, theologica, grotius, also, developed, a, particular, view, of, the, atonement, of, christ, known, as, the, governmental, theory, of, atonement, he, theorized, that, jesus, sacrificial, death, occurred, in, order, for, the, father, to, forgive, while, still, maintaining, his, just, rule, over, the, universe, this, idea, further, developed, by, theologians, such, as, john, miley, became, one, of, the, prominent, views, of, the, atonement, in, methodist, arminianism, living, in, the, times, of, the, eighty, years, war, between, spain, and, the, netherlands, and, the, thirty, years, war, between, catholic, and, protestant, european, nations, catholic, france, being, in, the, otherwise, protestant, camp, it, is, not, surprising, that, grotius, was, deeply, concerned, with, matters, of, conflicts, between, nations, and, religions, his, most, lasting, work, begun, in, prison, and, published, during, his, exile, in, paris, was, a, monumental, effort, to, restrain, such, conflicts, on, the, basis, of, a, broad, moral, consensus, grotius, wrote, fully, convinced, that, there, is, a, common, law, among, nations, which, is, valid, alike, for, war, and, in, war, i, have, had, many, and, weighty, reasons, for, undertaking, to, write, upon, the, subject, throughout, the, christian, world, i, observed, a, lack, of, restraint, in, relation, to, war, such, as, even, barbarous, races, should, be, ashamed, of, i, observed, that, men, rush, to, arms, for, slight, causes, or, no, cause, at, all, and, that, when, arms, have, once, been, taken, up, there, is, no, longer, any, respect, for, law, divine, or, human, it, is, as, if, in, accordance, with, a, general, decree, frenzy, had, openly, been, let, loose, for, the, committing, of, all, crimes, de, jure, belli, ac, pacis, libri, tres, on, the, law, of, war, and, peace, three, books, was, first, published, in, 1625, dedicated, to, grotius, current, patron, louis, xiii, the, treatise, advances, a, system, of, principles, of, natural, law, which, are, held, to, be, binding, on, all, people, and, nations, regardless, of, local, custom, the, work, is, divided, into, three, books, grotius, concept, of, natural, law, had, a, strong, impact, on, the, philosophical, and, theological, debates, and, political, developments, of, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, among, those, he, influenced, were, samuel, pufendorf, and, john, locke, and, by, way, of, these, philosophers, his, thinking, became, part, of, the, cultural, background, of, the, glorious, revolution, in, england, and, the, american, revolution, in, grotius, understanding, nature, was, not, an, entity, in, itself, but, god, s, creation, therefore, his, concept, of, natural,
