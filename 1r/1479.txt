measure, which, threatens, not, only, to, change, the, form, of, our, government, but, ultimately, to, break, up, the, very, foundations, of, social, order, as, well, as, materially, to, forward, the, views, of, those, who, are, pursuing, the, project, throughout, the, civilised, world, gladstone, s, 45, minute, speech, made, a, great, impression, on, those, present, and, his, amendment, carried, 94, votes, to, 38, among, those, impressed, was, lord, lincoln, who, told, his, father, the, duke, of, newcastle, about, it, and, it, was, through, this, recommendation, that, the, duke, offered, gladstone, the, safe, seat, of, newark, which, he, then, controlled, following, the, success, of, his, double, first, william, travelled, with, his, brother, john, on, a, grand, tour, of, western, europe, although, gladstone, entered, lincoln, s, inn, in, 1833, with, intentions, of, becoming, a, barrister, by, 1839, he, had, requested, that, his, name, should, be, removed, from, the, list, because, he, no, longer, intended, to, be, called, to, the, bar, in, september, 1842, he, lost, the, forefinger, of, his, left, hand, in, an, accident, while, reloading, a, gun, thereafter, he, wore, a, glove, or, finger, sheath, stall, when, gladstone, was, 22, the, duke, of, newcastle, a, conservative, party, activist, provided, him, with, one, of, two, seats, at, newark, where, he, controlled, about, a, fourth, of, the, very, small, electorate, the, duke, spent, thousands, of, pounds, entertaining, the, voters, gladstone, displayed, remarkably, strong, technique, as, a, campaigner, and, stump, speaker, he, won, his, seat, at, the, 1832, united, kingdom, general, election, with, 887, votes, after, new, bills, to, protect, child, workers, were, proposed, following, the, publication, of, the, sadler, report, he, voted, against, the, 1833, factory, acts, that, would, regulate, the, hours, of, work, and, welfare, of, minors, employed, in, cotton, mills, gladstone, was, an, intense, opponent, of, the, opium, trade, referring, to, the, opium, trade, between, british, india, and, qing, china, gladstone, described, it, as, infamous, and, atrocious, gladstone, emerged, as, a, fierce, critic, of, the, opium, wars, which, britain, waged, to, re, legalise, the, british, opium, trade, into, china, which, had, been, made, illegal, by, the, chinese, government, he, publicly, lambasted, the, wars, as, palmerston, s, opium, war, and, said, that, he, felt, in, dread, of, the, judgements, of, god, upon, england, for, our, national, iniquity, towards, china, in, may, 1840, a, famous, speech, was, made, by, gladstone, in, parliament, against, the, first, opium, war, gladstone, criticised, it, as, a, war, more, unjust, in, its, origin, a, war, more, calculated, in, its, progress, to, cover, this, country, with, permanent, disgrace, his, hostility, to, opium, stemmed, from, the, effects, of, opium, upon, his, sister, helen, before, 1841, gladstone, was, reluctant, to, join, the, peel, government, because, of, the, first, opium, war, which, palmerston, had, brought, on, gladstone, was, re, elected, in, 1841, in, the, second, ministry, of, robert, peel, he, served, as, president, of, the, board, of, trade, 1843, 1845, gladstone, was, responsible, for, the, railways, act, 1844, regarded, by, historians, as, the, birth, of, the, regulatory, state, of, network, industry, regulation, of, rate, of, return, regulation, and, telegraph, regulation, examples, of, its, foresight, are, the, clauses, empowering, the, government, to, take, control, of, railways, in, times, of, war, the, concept, of, parliamentary, trains, limited, in, cost, to, a, penny, a, mile, of, universal, service, and, of, control, of, the, recently, invented, electric, telegraph, which, ran, alongside, railway, lines, railways, were, the, largest, investment, as, a, percentage, of, gnp, in, human, history, and, this, bill, the, most, heavily, lobbied, in, parliamentary, history, gladstone, succeeded, in, guiding, the, act, through, parliament, at, the, height, of, the, railway, bubble, gladstone, became, concerned, with, the, situation, of, coal, whippers, these, were, the, men, who, worked, on, london, docks, whipping, in, baskets, from, ships, to, barges, or, wharves, all, incoming, coal, from, the, sea, they, were, called, up, and, relieved, through, public, houses, so, a, man, could, not, get, this, job, unless, he, had, the, favourable, opinion, of, the, publican, who, looked, most, favourably, upon, those, who, drank, the, man, s, name, was, written, down, and, the, score, followed, publicans, issued, employment, solely, on, the, capacity, of, the, man, to, pay, and, men, were, often, drunk, when, they, left, the, pub, to, work, they, spent, their, savings, on, drinks, to, secure, the, favourable, opinion, of, publicans, and, further, employment, gladstone, initiated, the, coal, vendors, act, of, 1843, which, set, up, a, central, office, for, employment, when, that, act, expired, in, 1856, a, select, committee, was, appointed, by, the, lords, in, 1857, to, look, into, the, question, gladstone, gave, evidence, to, the, committee, stating, i, approached, the, subject, in, the, first, instance, as, i, think, everyone, in, parliament, of, necessity, did, with, the, strongest, possible, prejudice, against, the, proposal, but, the, facts, stated, were, of, so, extraordinary, and, deplorable, a, character, that, it, was, impossible, to, withhold, attention, from, them, then, the, question, being, whether, legislative, interference, was, required, i, was, at, length, induced, to, look, at, a, remedy, of, an, extraordinary, character, as, the, only, one, i, thought, applicable, to, the, case, it, was, a, great, innovation, looking, back, in, 1883, gladstone, wrote, that, in, principle, perhaps, my, coalwhippers, act, of, 1843, was, the, most, socialistic, measure, of, the, last, half, century, he, resigned, in, 1845, over, the, maynooth, grant, issue, which, was, a, matter, of, conscience, for, him, to, improve, relations, with, the, catholic, church, peel, s, government, proposed, increasing, the, annual, grant, paid, to, the, maynooth, seminary, for, training, catholic, priests, in, ireland, gladstone, who, had, previously, argued, in, a, book, that, a, protestant, country, should, not, pay, money, to, other, churches, nevertheless, supported, the, increase, in, the, maynooth, grant, and, voted, for, it, in, commons, but, resigned, rather, than, face, charges, that, he, had, compromised, his, principles, to, remain, in, office, after, accepting, gladstone, s, resignation, peel, confessed, to, a, friend, i, really, have, great, difficulty, sometimes, in, exactly, comprehending, what, he, means, in, december, 1845, gladstone, returned, to, peel, s, government, as, colonial, secretary, the, dictionary, of, national, biography, notes, as, such, he, had, to, stand, for, re, election, but, the, strong, protectionism, of, the, duke, of, newcastle, his, patron, in, newark, meant, that, he, could, not, stand, there, and, no, other, seat, was, available, throughout, the, corn, law, crisis, of, 1846, therefore, gladstone, was, in, the, highly, anomalous, and, possibly, unique, position, of, being, a, secretary, of, state, without, a, seat, in, either, house, and, thus, unanswerable, to, parliament, when, peel, s, government, fell, in, 1846, gladstone, and, other, peel, loyalists, followed, their, leader, in, separating, from, the, protectionist, conservatives, instead, offering, tentative, support, to, the, new, whig, prime, minister, lord, john, russell, with, whom, peel, had, cooperated, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, after, peel, s, death, in, 1850, gladstone, emerged, as, the, leader, of, the, peelites, in, the, house, of, commons, he, was, re, elected, for, the, university, of, oxford, i, e, representing, the, ma, graduates, of, the, university, at, the, general, election, in, 1847, peel, had, once, held, this, seat, but, had, lost, it, because, of, his, espousal, of, catholic, emancipation, in, 1829, gladstone, became, a, constant, critic, of, lord, palmerston, in, 1847, gladstone, helped, to, establish, glenalmond, college, then, the, holy, and, undivided, trinity, college, at, glenalmond, the, school, was, set, up, as, an, episcopal, foundation, to, spread, the, ideas, of, anglicanism, in, scotland, and, to, educate, the, sons, of, the, gentry, as, a, young, man, gladstone, had, treated, his, father, s, estate, fasque, in, kincardineshire, southwest, of, aberdeen, as, home, but, as, a, younger, son, he, would, not, inherit, it, instead, from, the, time, of, his, marriage, he, lived, at, his, wife, s, family, s, estate, at, hawarden, in, flintshire, wales, he, never, actually, owned, hawarden, which, belonged, first, to, his, brother, in, law, sir, stephen, glynne, and, was, then, inherited, by, gladstone, s, eldest, son, in, 1874, during, the, late, 1840s, when, he, was, out, of, office, he, worked, extensively, to, turn, hawarden, into, a, viable, business, in, 1848, he, founded, the, church, penitentiary, association, for, the, reclamation, of, fallen, women, in, may, 1849, he, began, his, most, active, rescue, work, and, met, prostitutes, late, at, night, on, the, street, in, his, house, or, in, their, houses, writing, their, names, in, a, private, notebook, he, aided, the, house, of, mercy, at, clewer, near, windsor, which, exercised, extreme, in, house, discipline, and, spent, much, time, arranging, employment, for, ex, prostitutes, in, a, declaration, signed, on, 7, december, 1896, and, only, to, be, opened, after, his, death, gladstone, wrote, i, desire, to, record, my, solemn, declaration, and, assurance, as, in, the, sight, of, god, and, before, his, judgement, seat, that, at, no, period, of, my, life, have, i, been, guilty, of, the, act, which, is, known, as, that, of, infidelity, to, the, marriage, bed, in, 1850, 51, gladstone, visited, naples, italy, for, the, benefit, of, his, daughter, mary, s, eyesight, giacomo, lacaita, a, legal, adviser, to, the, british, embassy, was, at, the, time, imprisoned, by, the, neapolitan, government, as, were, other, political, dissidents, gladstone, became, concerned, about, the, political, situation, in, naples, and, the, arrest, and, imprisonment, of, neapolitan, liberals, in, february, 1851, gladstone, visited, the, prisons, where, thousands, of, them, were, held, and, was, extremely, outraged, in, april, and, july, he, published, two, letters, to, the, earl, of, aberdeen, against, the, neapolitan, government, and, responded, to, his, critics, in, an, examination, of, the, official, reply, of, the, neapolitan, government, in, 1852, gladstone, s, first, letter, described, what, he, saw, in, naples, as, the, negation, of, god, erected, into, a, system, of, government, in, 1852, following, the, appointment, of, lord, aberdeen, as, prime, minister, head, of, a, coalition, of, whigs, and, peelites, gladstone, became, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, the, whig, sir, charles, wood, and, the, tory, disraeli, had, both, been, perceived, to, have, failed, in, the, office, and, so, this, provided, gladstone, with, a, great, political, opportunity, his, first, budget, in, 1853, almost, completed, the, work, begun, by, peel, eleven, years, before, in, simplifying, britain, s, tariff, of, duties, and, customs, 123, duties, were, abolished, and, 133, duties, were, reduced, the, income, tax, had, legally, expired, but, gladstone, proposed, to, extend, it, for, seven, years, to, fund, tariff, reductions, we, propose, then, to, re, enact, it, for, two, years, from, april, 1853, to, april, 1855, at, the, rate, of, 7d, in, the, from, april, 1855, to, enact, it, for, two, more, years, at, 6d, in, the, and, then, for, three, years, more, from, april, 1857, at, 5d, under, this, proposal, on, 5, april, 1860, the, income, tax, will, by, law, expire, gladstone, wanted, to, maintain, a, balance, between, direct, and, indirect, taxation, and, to, abolish, income, tax, he, knew, that, its, abolition, depended, on, a, considerable, retrenchment, in, government, expenditure, he, therefore, increased, the, number, of, people, eligible, to, pay, it, by, lowering, the, threshold, from, 150, to, 100, the, more, people, that, paid, income, tax, gladstone, believed, the, more, the, public, would, pressure, the, government, into, abolishing, it, gladstone, argued, that, the, 100, line, was, the, dividing, line, between, the, educated, and, the, labouring, part, of, the, community, and, that, therefore, the, income, taxpayers, and, the, electorate, were, to, be, the, same, people, who, would, then, vote, to, cut, government, expenditure, the, budget, speech, delivered, on, 18, april, nearly, five, hours, long, raised, gladstone, at, once, to, the, front, rank, of, financiers, as, of, orators, h, c, g, matthew, has, written, that, gladstone, made, finance, and, figures, exciting, and, succeeded, in, constructing, budget, speeches, epic, in, form, and, performance, often, with, lyrical, interludes, to, vary, the, tension, in, the, commons, as, the, careful, exposition, of, figures, and, argument, was, brought, to, a, climax, the, contemporary, diarist, charles, greville, wrote, of, gladstone, s, speech, by, universal, consent, it, was, one, of, the, grandest, displays, and, most, able, financial, statement, that, ever, was, heard, in, the, house, of, commons, a, great, scheme, boldly, skilfully, and, honestly, devised, disdaining, popular, clamour, and, pressure, from, without, and, the, execution, of, it, absolute, perfection, even, those, who, do, not, admire, the, budget, or, who, are, injured, by, it, admit, the, merit, of, the, performance, it, has, raised, gladstone, to, a, great, political, elevation, and, what, is, of, far, greater, consequence, than, the, measure, itself, has, given, the, country, assurance, of, a, man, equal, to, great, political, necessities, and, fit, to, lead, parties, and, direct, governments, during, wartime, he, insisted, on, raising, taxes, and, not, borrowing, funds, to, pay, for, the, war, the, goal, was, to, turn, wealthy, britons, against, expensive, wars, britain, entered, the, crimean, war, in, february, 1854, and, gladstone, introduced, his, budget, on, 6, march, he, had, to, increase, expenditure, on, the, military, and, a, vote, of, credit, of, 1, 250, 000, was, taken, to, send, a, force, of, 25, 000, to, the, front, the, deficit, for, the, year, would, be, 2, 840, 000, estimated, revenue, 56, 680, 000, estimated, expenditure, 59, 420, 000, gladstone, refused, to, borrow, the, money, needed, to, rectify, this, deficit, and, instead, increased, income, tax, by, half, from, sevenpence, to, tenpence, halfpenny, in, the, pound, from, 2, 92, to, 4, 38, by, may, another, 6, 870, 000, was, needed, for, the, war, and, gladstone, raised, the, income, tax, from, tenpence, halfpenny, to, fourteen, pence, in, the, pound, to, raise, 3, 250, 000, spirits, malt, and, sugar, were, taxed, to, raise, the, rest, of, the, money, needed, he, proclaimed, he, served, until, 1855, a, few, weeks, into, lord, palmerston, s, first, premiership, and, resigned, along, with, the, rest, of, the, peelites, after, a, motion, was, passed, to, appoint, a, committee, of, inquiry, into, the, conduct, of, the, war, the, conservative, leader, lord, derby, became, prime, minister, in, 1858, but, gladstone, who, like, the, other, peelites, was, still, nominally, a, conservative, declined, a, position, in, his, government, opting, not, to, sacrifice, his, free, trade, principles, between, november, 1858, and, february, 1859, gladstone, on, behalf, of, lord, derby, s, government, was, made, extraordinary, lord, high, commissioner, of, the, ionian, islands, embarking, via, vienna, and, trieste, on, a, twelve, week, mission, to, the, southern, adriatic, entrusted, with, complex, challenges, that, had, arisen, in, connection, with, the, future, of, the, british, protectorate, of, the, united, states, of, the, ionian, islands, in, 1858, gladstone, took, up, the, hobby, of, tree, felling, mostly, of, oak, trees, an, exercise, he, continued, with, enthusiasm, until, he, was, 81, in, 1891, eventually, he, became, notorious, for, this, activity, prompting, lord, randolph, churchill, to, observe, for, the, purposes, of, recreation, he, has, selected, the, felling, of, trees, and, we, may, usefully, remark, that, his, amusements, like, his, politics, are, essentially, destructive, every, afternoon, the, whole, world, is, invited, to, assist, at, the, crashing, fall, of, some, beech, or, elm, or, oak, the, forest, laments, in, order, that, mr, gladstone, may, perspire, less, noticed, at, the, time, was, his, practice, of, replacing, the, trees, felled, by, planting, new, saplings, gladstone, was, a, lifelong, bibliophile, in, his, lifetime, he, read, around, 20, 000, books, and, eventually, owned, a, library, of, over, 32, 000, in, 1859, lord, palmerston, formed, a, new, mixed, government, with, radicals, included, and, gladstone, again, joined, the, government, with, most, of, the, other, remaining, peelites, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, to, become, part, of, the, new, liberal, party, gladstone, inherited, a, deficit, of, nearly, 5, 000, 000, with, income, tax, now, set, at, 5d, fivepence, like, peel, gladstone, dismissed, the, idea, of, borrowing, to, cover, the, deficit, gladstone, argued, that, in, time, of, peace, nothing, but, dire, necessity, should, induce, us, to, borrow, most, of, the, money, needed, was, acquired, through, raising, the, income, tax, to, 9d, usually, not, more, than, two, thirds, of, a, tax, imposed, could, be, collected, in, a, financial, year, so, gladstone, therefore, imposed, the, extra, four, pence, at, a, rate, of, 8d, during, the, first, half, of, the, year, so, that, he, could, obtain, the, additional, revenue, in, one, year, gladstone, s, dividing, line, set, up, in, 1853, had, been, abolished, in, 1858, but, gladstone, revived, it, with, lower, incomes, to, pay, 6, d, instead, of, 9d, for, the, first, half, of, the, year, the, lower, incomes, paid, 8d, and, the, higher, incomes, paid, 13d, in, income, tax, on, 12, september, 1859, the, radical, mp, richard, cobden, visited, gladstone, who, recorded, it, in, his, diary, further, conv, with, mr, cobden, on, tariffs, relations, with, france, we, are, closely, warmly, agreed, cobden, was, sent, as, britain, s, representative, to, the, negotiations, with, france, s, michel, chevalier, for, a, free, trade, treaty, between, the, two, countries, gladstone, wrote, to, cobden, the, great, aim, the, moral, and, political, significance, of, the, act, and, its, probable, and, desired, fruit, in, binding, the, two, countries, together, by, interest, and, affection, neither, you, nor, i, attach, for, the, moment, any, superlative, value, to, this, treaty, for, the, sake, of, the, extension, of, british, trade, what, i, look, to, is, the, social, good, the, benefit, to, the, relations, of, the, two, countries, and, the, effect, on, the, peace, of, europe, gladstone, s, budget, of, 1860, was, introduced, on, 10, february, along, with, the, cobden, chevalier, treaty, between, britain, and, france, that, would, reduce, tariffs, between, the, two, countries, this, budget, marked, the, final, adoption, of, the, free, trade, principle, that, taxation, should, be, levied, for, revenue, purposes, alone, and, that, every, protective, differential, or, discriminating, duty, should, be, dislodged, at, the, beginning, of, 1859, there, were, 419, duties, in, existence, the, 1860, budget, reduced, the, number, of, duties, to, 48, with, 15, duties, constituting, the, majority, of, the, revenue, to, finance, these, reductions, in, indirect, taxation, the, income, tax, instead, of, being, abolished, was, raised, to, 10d, for, incomes, above, 150, and, at, 7d, for, incomes, above, 100, in, 1860, gladstone, intended, to, abolish, the, duty, on, paper, a, controversial, policy, because, the, duty, traditionally, inflated, the, cost, of, publishing, and, hindered, the, dissemination, of, radical, working, class, ideas, although, palmerston, supported, the, continuation, of, the, duty, using, it, and, income, tax, revenue, to, buy, arms, a, majority, of, his, cabinet, supported, gladstone, the, bill, to, abolish, duties, on, paper, narrowly, passed, the, commons, but, was, rejected, by, the, house, of, lords, no, money, bill, had, been, rejected, by, lords, for, over, 200, years, and, a, furore, arose, over, this, vote, the, next, year, gladstone, included, the, abolition, of, paper, duty, in, a, consolidated, finance, bill, the, first, ever, to, force, the, lords, to, accept, it, and, accept, it, they, did, the, proposal, in, the, commons, of, one, bill, only, per, session, for, the, national, finances, was, a, precedent, uniformly, followed, from, that, date, until, 1910, and, it, has, been, ever, since, the, rule, gladstone, steadily, reduced, income, tax, over, the, course, of, his, tenure, as, chancellor, in, 1861, the, tax, was, reduced, to, ninepence, 0, 0s, 9d, in, 1863, to, sevenpence, in, 1864, to, fivepence, and, in, 1865, to, fourpence, gladstone, believed, that, government, was, extravagant, and, wasteful, with, taxpayers, money, and, so, sought, to, let, money, fructify, in, the, pockets, of, the, people, by, keeping, taxation, levels, down, through, peace, and, retrenchment, in, 1859, he, wrote, to, his, brother, who, was, a, member, of, the, financial, reform, association, at, liverpool, economy, is, the, first, and, great, article, economy, such, as, i, understand, it, in, my, financial, creed, the, controversy, between, direct, and, indirect, taxation, holds, a, minor, though, important, place, he, wrote, to, his, wife, on, 14, january, 1860, i, am, certain, from, experience, of, the, immense, advantage, of, strict, account, keeping, in, early, life, it, is, just, like, learning, the, grammar, then, which, when, once, learned, need, not, be, referred, to, afterwards, due, to, his, actions, as, chancellor, gladstone, earned, the, reputation, as, the, liberator, of, british, trade, and, the, working, man, s, breakfast, table, the, man, responsible, for, the, emancipation, of, the, popular, press, from, taxes, upon, knowledge, and, for, placing, a, duty, on, the, succession, of, the, estates, of, the, rich, gladstone, s, popularity, rested, on, his, taxation, policies, which, meant, to, his, supporters, balance, social, equity, and, political, justice, the, most, significant, expression, of, working, class, opinion, was, at, northumberland, in, 1862, when, gladstone, visited, george, holyoake, recalled, in, 1865, when, mr, gladstone, visited, the, north, you, well, remember, when, word, passed, from, the, newspaper, to, the, workman, that, it, circulated, through, mines, and, mills, factories, and, workshops, and, they, came, out, to, greet, the, only, british, minister, who, ever, gave, the, english, people, a, right, because, it, was, just, they, should, have, it, and, when, he, went, down, the, tyne, all, the, country, heard, how, twenty, miles, of, banks, were, lined, with, people, who, came, to, greet, him, men, stood, in, the, blaze, of, chimneys, the, roofs, of, factories, were, crowded, colliers, came, up, from, the, mines, women, held, up, their, children, on, the, banks, that, it, might, be, said, in, after, life, that, they, had, seen, the, chancellor, of, the, people, go, by, the, river, was, covered, like, the, land, every, man, who, could, ply, an, oar, pulled, up, to, give, mr, gladstone, a, cheer, when, lord, palmerston, went, to, bradford, the, streets, were, still, and, working, men, imposed, silence, upon, themselves, when, mr, gladstone, appeared, on, the, tyne, he, heard, cheer, no, other, english, minister, ever, heard, the, people, were, grateful, to, him, and, rough, pitmen, who, never, approached, a, public, man, before, pressed, round, his, carriage, by, thousands, and, thousands, of, arms, were, stretched, out, at, once, to, shake, hands, with, mr, gladstone, as, one, of, themselves, when, gladstone, first, joined, palmerston, s, government, in, 1859, he, had, opposed, further, electoral, reform, but, he, changed, his, position, during, palmerston, s, last, premiership, and, by, 1865, he, was, firmly, in, favour, of, enfranchising, the, working, classes, in, towns, the, policy, caused, friction, with, palmerston, who, strongly, opposed, enfranchisement, at, the, beginning, of, each, session, gladstone, would, passionately, urge, the, cabinet, to, adopt, new, policies, while, palmerston, would, fixedly, stare, at, a, paper, before, him, at, a, lull, in, gladstone, s, speech, palmerston, would, smile, rap, the, table, with, his, knuckles, and, interject, pointedly, now, my, lords, and, gentlemen, let, us, go, to, business, although, he, personally, was, not, a, nonconformist, and, rather, disliked, them, in, person, he, formed, a, coalition, with, the, nonconformists, that, gave, the, liberals, a, powerful, base, of, support, palmerston, s, government, adopted, a, position, of, british, neutrality, throughout, the, war, while, declining, to, recognise, the, independence, of, the, confederacy, in, october, 1862, gladstone, made, a, speech, in, newcastle, in, which, he, said, that, jefferson, davis, and, the, other, confederate, leaders, had, made, a, nation, and, that, the, confederacy, seemed, certain, to, succeed, in, asserting, its, independence, from, the, north, and, that, the, time, might, come, when, it, would, be, the, duty, of, the, european, powers, to, offer, friendly, aid, in, compromising, the, quarrel, the, speech, caused, consternation, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, and, led, to, speculation, that, britain, might, be, about, to, recognise, the, confederacy, gladstone, was, accused, of, sympathising, with, the, south, a, charge, he, rejected, gladstone, was, forced, to, clarify, in, the, press, that, his, comments, in, newcastle, had, not, been, intended, to, signal, a, change, in, government, policy, but, to, express, his, belief, that, the, north, s, efforts, to, defeat, the, south, would, fail, due, to, the, strength, of, southern, resistance, in, may, 1864, gladstone, said, that, he, saw, no, reason, in, principle, why, all, mentally, able, men, could, not, be, enfranchised, but, admitted, that, this, would, only, come, about, once, the, working, classes, themselves, showed, more, interest, in, the, subject, queen, victoria, was, not, pleased, with, this, statement, and, an, outraged, palmerston, considered, it, a, seditious, incitement, to, agitation, gladstone, s, support, for, electoral, reform, and, disestablishment, of, the, anglican, church, of, ireland, won, support, from, nonconformists, but, alienated, him, from, constituents, in, his, oxford, university, seat, and, he, lost, it, in, the, 1865, general, election, a, month, later, he, stood, as, a, candidate, in, south, lancashire, where, he, was, elected, third, mp, south, lancashire, at, this, time, elected, three, mps, palmerston, campaigned, for, gladstone, in, oxford, because, he, believed, that, his, constituents, would, keep, him, partially, muzzled, many, oxford, graduates, were, anglican, clergymen, at, that, time, a, victorious, gladstone, told, his, new, constituency, at, last, my, friends, i, am, come, among, you, and, i, am, come, to, use, an, expression, which, has, become, very, famous, and, is, not, likely, to, be, forgotten, i, am, come, unmuzzled, on, palmerston, s, death, in, october, earl, russell, formed, his, second, ministry, russell, and, gladstone, now, the, senior, liberal, in, the, house, of, commons, attempted, to, pass, a, reform, bill, which, was, defeated, in, the, commons, because, the, adullamite, whigs, led, by, robert, lowe, refused, to, support, it, the, conservatives, then, formed, a, ministry, in, which, after, a, long, parliamentary, debate, disraeli, passed, the, second, reform, act, of, 1867, gladstone, s, proposed, bill, had, been, totally, outmanoeuvred, he, stormed, into, the, chamber, but, too, late, to, see, his, arch, enemy, pass, the, bill, gladstone, was, furious, his, animus, commenced, a, long, rivalry, that, would, only, end, on, disraeli, s, death, and, gladstone, s, encomium, in, the, commons, in, 1881, lord, russell, retired, in, 1867, and, gladstone, became, leader, of, the, liberal, party, in, 1868, the, irish, church, resolutions, were, proposed, as, a, measure, to, reunite, the, liberal, party, in, government, on, the, issue, of, disestablishment, of, the, church, of, ireland, this, would, be, done, during, gladstone, s, first, government, in, 1869, and, meant, that, irish, roman, catholics, did, not, need, to, pay, their, tithes, to, the, anglican, church, of, ireland, when, it, was, passed, disraeli, took, the, hint, and, called, a, general, election, in, the, next, general, election, in, 1868, the, south, lancashire, constituency, had, been, broken, up, by, the, second, reform, act, into, two, south, east, lancashire, and, south, west, lancashire, gladstone, stood, for, south, west, lancashire, and, for, greenwich, it, being, quite, common, then, for, candidates, to, stand, in, two, constituencies, simultaneously, to, his, great, surprise, he, was, defeated, in, south, west, lancashire, but, by, winning, in, greenwich, was, able, to, remain, in, parliament, he, became, prime, minister, for, the, first, time, and, remained, in, office, until, 1874, evelyn, ashley, recorded, that, he, had, been, felling, a, tree, at, hawarden, when, brought, the, news, that, he, was, about, to, be, appointed, prime, minister, he, broke, off, briefly, to, declare, my, mission, is, to, pacify, ireland, before, resuming, his, exertions, in, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, gladstonian, liberalism, was, characterised, by, a, number, of, policies, intended, to, improve, individual, liberty, and, loosen, political, and, economic, restraints, first, was, the, minimisation, of, public, expenditure, on, the, premise, that, the, economy, and, society, were, best, helped, by, allowing, people, to, spend, as, they, saw, fit, secondly, his, foreign, policy, aimed, at, promoting, peace, to, help, reduce, expenditures, and, taxation, and, enhance, trade, thirdly, laws, that, prevented, people, from, acting, freely, to, improve, themselves, were, reformed, when, an, unemployed, miner, daniel, jones, wrote, to, him, to, complain, of, his, unemployment, and, low, wages, gladstone, gave, what, h, c, g, matthew, has, called, the, classic, mid, victorian, reply, on, 20, october, 1869, the, only, means, which, have, been, placed, in, my, power, of, raising, the, wages, of, colliers, has, been, by, endeavouring, to, beat, down, all, those, restrictions, upon, trade, which, tend, to, reduce, the, price, to, be, obtained, for, the, product, of, their, labour, to, lower, as, much, as, may, be, the, taxes, on, the, commodities, which, they, may, require, for,

dramatic, reduction, in, supposedly, sentimental, and, unsystematic, outdoor, poor, relief, and, in, making, in, co, operation, with, the, charity, organization, society, 1869, the, most, sustained, attempt, of, the, century, to, impose, upon, the, working, classes, the, victorian, values, of, providence, self, reliance, foresight, and, self, discipline, gladstone, was, associated, with, the, charity, organization, society, s, first, annual, report, in, 1870, some, leading, conservatives, at, this, time, were, contemplating, an, alliance, between, the, aristocracy, and, the, working,

peacetime, flogging, illegal, in, 1870, his, government, passed, the, irish, land, act, and, forster, s, education, act, in, 1871, his, government, passed, the, trade, union, act, allowing, trade, unions, to, organise, and, operate, legally, for, the, first, time, although, picketing, remained, illegal, gladstone, later, counted, this, reform, as, one, of, the, most, significant, of, the, previous, half, century, saying, that, prior, to, its, passage, the, law, had, effectively, compelled, the, british, workman, to, work, in, chains, in, 1871, he, instituted, the, universities, tests,

gladstone, s, proposals, went, some, way, to, meet, working, class, demands, such, as, the, realisation, of, the, free, breakfast, table, through, repealing, duties, on, tea, and, sugar, and, reform, of, local, taxation, which, was, increasing, for, the, poorer, ratepayers, according, to, the, working, class, financial, reformer, thomas, briggs, writing, in, the, trade, unionist, newspaper, the,

the, liberal, campaign, lasted, several, months, only, three, weeks, separated, the, news, of, the, dissolution, and, the, election, the, working, class, newspapers, were, so, taken, by, surprise, they, had, little, time, to, express, an, opinion, on, gladstone, s, manifesto, before, the, election, was, over, unlike, the, efforts, of, the, conservatives, the, organisation, of, the, liberal, party, had, declined, since, 1868, and, they, had, also, failed, to, retain, liberal, voters, on, the, electoral, register, george, howell, wrote, to, gladstone, on, 12, february, there, is, one, lesson, to, be, learned, from, this, election, that, is, organization, we, have, lost, not, by, a, change, of, sentiment, so, much, as, by, want, of, organised, power, the, liberals, received, a, majority, of, the, vote, in, each, of, the, constituent, countries, of, the, united, kingdom, and, 189, 000, more, votes, nationally, than, the, conservatives, however, they, obtained, a, minority, of, seats, in, the, house, of, commons, in, the, wake, of, benjamin, disraeli, s, victory, gladstone, retired, from, the, leadership, of, the, liberal, party, although, he, retained, his, seat, in, the, house, gladstone, had, a, complex, ambivalence, about, catholicism, he, was, attracted, by, its, international, success, in, majestic, traditions, more, important, he, was, strongly, opposed, to, the, authoritarianism, of, its, pope, and, bishops, its, profound, public, opposition, to, liberalism, and, its, supposed, refusal, to, distinguish, between, secular, allegiance, on, the, one, hand, and, spiritual, obedience, on, the, other, in, november, 1874, he, published, the, pamphlet, the, vatican, decrees, in, their, bearing, on, civil, allegiance, directed, at, the, first, vatican, council, s, dogmatising, papal, infallibility, in, 1870, which, had, outraged, him, gladstone, claimed, that, this, decree, had, placed, british, catholics, in, a, dilemma, over, conflicts, of, loyalty, to, the, crown, he, urged, them, to, reject, papal, infallibility, as, they, had, opposed, the, spanish, armada, of, 1588, the, pamphlet, sold, 150, 000, copies, by, the, end, of, 1874, cardinal, manning, denied, that, the, council, had, changed, the, relation, of, catholics, to, their, civil, governments, and, archbishop, james, roosevelt, bayley, in, a, letter, which, was, obtained, by, the, new, york, herald, and, published, without, bayley, s, express, permission, called, gladstone, s, declaration, a, shameful, calumny, and, attributed, his, monomania, to, the, political, hari, kari, he, had, committed, by, dissolving, parliament, accusing, him, of, putting, on, the, cap, and, bells, and, attempting, to, play, the, part, of, lord, george, gordon, in, order, to, restore, his, political, fortunes, john, henry, newman, wrote, the, letter, to, the, duke, of, norfolk, in, reply, to, gladstone, s, charges, that, catholics, have, no, mental, freedom, and, cannot, be, good, citizens, a, second, pamphlet, followed, in, feb, 1875, a, defence, of, the, earlier, pamphlet, and, a, reply, to, his, critics, entitled, vaticanism, an, answer, to, reproofs, and, replies, he, described, the, catholic, church, as, an, asian, monarchy, nothing, but, one, giddy, height, of, despotism, and, one, dead, level, of, religious, subservience, he, further, claimed, that, the, pope, wanted, to, destroy, the, rule, of, law, and, replace, it, with, arbitrary, tyranny, and, then, to, hide, these, crimes, against, liberty, beneath, a, suffocating, cloud, of, incense, gladstone, was, opposed, to, socialism, after, 1842, when, he, heard, a, socialist, lecturer, lord, kilbracken, one, of, gladstone, s, secretaries, commented, the, liberal, doctrines, of, that, time, with, their, violent, anti, socialist, spirit, and, their, strong, insistence, on, the, gospel, of, thrift, self, help, settlement, of, wages, by, the, higgling, of, the, market, and, non, interference, by, the, state, i, think, that, mr, gladstone, was, the, strongest, anti, socialist, that, i, have, ever, known, it, is, quite, true, as, has, been, often, said, that, we, are, all, socialists, up, to, a, certain, point, but, mr, gladstone, fixed, that, point, lower, and, was, more, vehement, against, those, who, went, above, it, than, any, other, politician, or, official, of, my, acquaintance, i, remember, his, speaking, indignantly, to, me, of, the, budget, of, 1874, as, that, socialistic, budget, of, northcote, s, merely, because, of, the, special, relief, which, it, gave, to, the, poorer, class, of, income, tax, payers, his, strong, belief, in, free, trade, was, only, one, of, the, results, of, his, deep, rooted, conviction, that, the, government, s, interference, with, the, free, action, of, the, individual, whether, by, taxation, or, otherwise, should, be, kept, at, an, irreducible, minimum, it, is, indeed, not, too, much, to, say, that, his, conception, of, liberalism, was, the, negation, of, socialism, a, pamphlet, gladstone, published, on, 6, september, 1876, bulgarian, horrors, and, the, question, of, the, east, attacked, the, disraeli, government, for, its, indifference, to, the, ottoman, empire, s, violent, repression, of, the, bulgarian, april, uprising, gladstone, made, clear, his, hostility, focused, on, the, turkish, people, rather, than, on, the, muslim, religion, the, turks, he, said, were, upon, the, whole, from, the, black, day, when, they, first, entered, europe, the, one, great, anti, human, specimen, of, humanity, wherever, they, went, a, broad, line, of, blood, marked, the, track, behind, them, and, as, far, as, their, dominion, reached, civilisation, disappeared, from, view, they, represented, everywhere, government, by, force, as, opposed, to, government, by, law, for, the, guide, of, this, life, they, had, a, relentless, fatalism, for, its, reward, hereafter, a, sensual, paradise, the, historian, geoffrey, alderman, has, described, gladstone, as, unleashing, the, full, fury, of, his, oratorical, powers, against, jews, and, jewish, influence, during, the, bulgarian, crisis, 1885, 88, telling, a, journalist, in, 1876, that, i, deeply, deplore, the, manner, in, which, what, i, may, call, judaic, sympathies, beyond, as, well, as, within, the, circle, of, professed, judaism, are, now, acting, on, the, question, of, the, east, gladstone, similarly, refused, to, speak, out, against, the, persecution, of, romanian, jews, in, the, 1870s, and, russian, jews, in, the, early, 1880s, in, response, the, jewish, chronicle, attacked, gladstone, in, 1888, arguing, that, are, we, because, there, was, once, a, liberal, party, to, bow, down, and, worship, gladstone, the, great, minister, who, was, too, christian, in, his, charity, too, russian, in, his, proclivities, to, raise, voice, or, finger, to, defend, russian, jews, alderman, attributes, these, developments, along, with, other, factors, to, the, collapse, of, the, previously, strong, ties, between, british, jews, and, liberalism, during, the, 1879, election, campaign, called, the, midlothian, campaign, he, rousingly, denounced, disraeli, s, foreign, policies, during, the, ongoing, second, anglo, afghan, war, in, afghanistan, see, great, game, he, saw, the, war, as, great, dishonour, and, also, criticised, british, conduct, in, the, zulu, war, gladstone, also, on, 29, november, condemned, what, he, saw, as, the, conservative, government, s, profligate, spending, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, shall, boldly, uphold, economy, in, detail, and, it, is, the, mark, of, a, chicken, hearted, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, when, he, shrinks, from, upholding, economy, in, detail, when, because, it, is, a, question, of, only, 2, 000, or, 3, 000, he, says, that, is, no, matter, he, is, ridiculed, no, doubt, for, what, is, called, saving, candle, ends, and, cheese, parings, no, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, is, worth, his, salt, who, is, not, ready, to, save, what, are, meant, by, candle, ends, and, cheese, parings, in, the, cause, of, his, country, no, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, is, worth, his, salt, who, makes, his, own, popularity, either, his, first, consideration, or, any, consideration, at, all, in, administrating, the, public, purse, you, would, not, like, to, have, a, housekeeper, or, steward, who, made, her, or, his, popularity, with, the, tradesmen, the, measure, of, the, payments, that, were, to, be, delivered, to, them, in, my, opinion, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, is, the, trusted, and, confidential, steward, of, the, public, he, is, under, a, sacred, obligation, with, regard, to, all, that, he, consents, to, spend, i, am, bound, to, say, hardly, ever, in, the, six, years, that, sir, stafford, northcote, has, been, in, office, have, i, heard, him, speak, a, resolute, word, on, behalf, of, economy, in, 1880, the, liberals, won, again,

and, also, in, leeds, where, he, had, also, been, adopted, as, a, candidate, as, he, could, lawfully, only, serve, as, mp, for, one, constituency, leeds, was, passed, to, his, son, herbert, one, of, his, other, sons, henry, was, also, elected, as, an, mp, queen, victoria, asked, lord, hartington, to, form, a, ministry, but, he, persuaded, her, to, send, for, gladstone, gladstone, s, second, administration, both, as, prime, minister, and, again, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, until, 1882, lasted, from, june, 1880, to, june, 1885, he, originally, intended, to, retire, at, the, end, of, 1882, the, 50th, anniversary, of, his, entry, into, politics, but, did, not, do, so, historians, have, debated, the, wisdom, of, gladstone, s, foreign, policy, during, his, second, ministry, paul, hayes, says, it, provides, one, of, the, most, intriguing, and, perplexing, tales, of, muddle, and, incompetence, in, foreign, affairs, unsurpassed, in, modern, political, history, until, the, days, of, grey, and, later, neville, chamberlain, gladstone, opposed, himself, to, the, colonial, lobby, pushing, for, the, scramble, for, africa, his, term, saw, the, end, of, the, second, anglo, afghan, war, the, first, boer, war, and, the, war, against, the, mahdi, in, sudan, on, 11, july, 1882, gladstone, ordered, the, bombardment, of, alexandria, starting, the, short, anglo, egyptian, war, of, 1882, the, british, won, decisively, and, although, they, repeatedly, promised, to, depart, in, a, few, years, the, actual, result, was, british, control, of, egypt, for, four, decades, largely, ignoring, ottoman, nominal, ownership, france, was, seriously, unhappy, having, lost, control, of, the, canal, that, it, built, and, financed, and, had, dreamed, of, for, decades, gladstone, s, role, in, the, decision, to, invade, was, described, as, relatively, hands, off, and, the, ultimate, responsibility, was, borne, by, certain, members, of, his, cabinet, such, as, lord, hartington, secretary, of, state, for, india, thomas, baring, 1st, earl, of, northbrook, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, hugh, childers, secretary, of, state, for, war, and, granville, leveson, gower, 2nd, earl, granville, the, foreign, secretary, historian, a, j, p, taylor, says, that, the, seizure, of, egypt, was, a, great, event, indeed, the, only, real, event, in, international, relations, between, the, battle, of, sedan, and, the, defeat, of, russia, in, the, russo, japanese, war, taylor, emphasizes, long, term, impact, the, british, occupation, of, egypt, altered, the, balance, of, power, it, not, only, gave, the, british, security, for, their, route, to, india, it, made, them, masters, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, and, the, middle, east, it, made, it, unnecessary, for, them, to, stand, on, the, front, line, against, russia, at, the, straits, and, thus, prepared, the, way, for, the, franco, russian, alliance, ten, years, later, gladstone, and, the, liberals, had, a, reputation, for, strong, opposition, to, imperialism, so, historians, have, long, debated, the, explanation, for, this, reversal, of, policy, the, most, influential, was, a, study, by, john, robinson, and, ronald, gallagher, africa, and, the, victorians, 1961, which, focused, on, the, imperialism, of, free, trade, and, was, promoted, by, the, cambridge, school, of, historiography, they, argue, there, was, no, long, term, liberal, plan, in, support, of, imperialism, instead, they, saw, the, urgent, necessity, to, act, to, protect, the, suez, canal, in, the, face, of, what, appeared, to, be, a, radical, collapse, of, law, and, order, and, a, nationalist, revolt, focused, on, expelling, the, europeans, regardless, of, the, damage, it, would, do, to, international, trade, and, the, british, empire, gladstone, s, decision, came, against, strained, relations, with, france, and, manoeuvring, by, men, on, the, spot, in, egypt, critics, such, as, cain, and, hopkins, have, stressed, the, need, to, protect, large, sums, invested, by, british, financiers, and, egyptian, bonds, while, downplaying, the, risk, to, the, viability, of, the, suez, canal, unlike, the, marxists, they, stress, gentlemanly, financial, and, commercial, interests, not, the, industrial, capitalism, that, marxists, believe, was, always, central, more, recently, specialists, on, egypt, have, been, interested, primarily, in, the, internal, dynamics, among, egyptians, that, produce, the, failed, urabi, revolt, in, 1881, he, established, the, irish, coercion, act, which, permitted, the, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, to, detain, people, for, as, long, as, was, thought, necessary, as, there, was, rural, disturbance, in, ireland, between, landlords, and, tenants, as, cavendish, the, irish, secretary, had, been, assassinated, by, irish, rebels, in, dublin, he, also, passed, the, second, land, act, the, first, in, 1870, had, entitled, irish, tenants, if, evicted, to, compensation, for, improvements, which, they, had, made, on, their, property, but, had, little, effect, which, gave, irish, tenants, the, 3fs, fair, rent, fixity, of, tenure, and, free, sale, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1881, gladstone, extended, the, vote, to, agricultural, labourers, and, others, in, the, 1884, reform, act, which, gave, the, counties, the, same, franchise, as, the, boroughs, adult, male, householders, and, 10, lodgers, and, added, six, million, to, the, total, number, of, people, who, could, vote, in, parliamentary, elections, parliamentary, reform, continued, with, the, redistribution, of, seats, act, 1885, gladstone, was, increasingly, uneasy, about, the, direction, in, which, british, politics, was, moving, in, a, letter, to, lord, acton, on, 11, february, 1885, gladstone, criticised, tory, democracy, as, demagogism, that, put, down, pacific, law, respecting, economic, elements, that, ennobled, the, old, conservatism, but, still, in, secret, as, obstinately, attached, as, ever, to, the, evil, principle, of, class, interests, he, found, contemporary, liberalism, better, but, far, from, being, good, gladstone, claimed, that, this, liberalism, s, pet, idea, is, what, they, call, construction, that, is, to, say, taking, into, the, hands, of, the, state, the, business, of, the, individual, man, both, tory, democracy, and, this, new, liberalism, gladstone, wrote, had, done, much, to, estrange, me, and, had, for, many, many, years, historian, sneh, mahajan, has, concluded, gladstone, s, second, ministry, remained, barren, of, any, achievement, in, the, domestic, sphere, his, downfall, came, in, africa, where, he, delayed, the, mission, to, rescue, general, gordon, s, force, which, had, been, under, siege, in, khartoum, for, 10, months, it, arrived, in, january, 1885, two, days, after, a, massacre, killed, approximately, 7, 000, british, and, egyptian, soldiers, and, 4, 000, civilians, the, disaster, proved, a, major, blow, to, gladstone, s, popularity, queen, victoria, sent, him, a, telegram, of, rebuke, which, found, its, way, into, the, press, critics, said, gladstone, had, neglected, military, affairs, and, had, not, acted, promptly, enough, to, save, the, besieged, gordon, critics, inverted, his, acronym, g, o, m, for, grand, old, man, to, m, o, g, for, murderer, of, gordon, he, resigned, as, prime, minister, in, june, 1885, and, declined, queen, victoria, s, offer, of, an, earldom, the, hawarden, kite, was, a, december, 1885, press, release, by, gladstone, s, son, and, aide, herbert, gladstone, announcing, that, he, had, become, convinced, that, ireland, needed, a, separate, parliament, the, bombshell, announcement, resulted, in, the, fall, of, lord, salisbury, s, conservative, government, irish, nationalists, led, by, charles, parnell, s, irish, parliamentary, party, held, the, balance, of, power, in, parliament, gladstone, s, conversion, to, home, rule, convinced, them, to, switch, away, from, the, conservatives, and, support, the, liberals, using, the, 86, seats, in, parliament, they, controlled, the, main, purpose, of, this, administration, was, to, deliver, ireland, a, reform, which, would, give, it, a, devolved, assembly, similar, to, those, which, would, be, eventually, put, in, place, in, scotland, and, wales, in, 1999, in, 1886, gladstone, s, party, allied, with, irish, nationalists, to, defeat, lord, salisbury, s, government, gladstone, regained, his, position, as, prime, minister, and, combined, the, office, with, that, of, lord, privy, seal, during, this, administration, he, first, introduced, his, home, rule, bill, for, ireland, the, issue, split, the, liberal, party, a, breakaway, group, went, on, to, create, the, liberal, unionist, party, and, the, bill, was, thrown, out, on, the, second, reading, ending, his, government, after, only, a, few, months, and, inaugurating, another, headed, by, lord, salisbury, gladstone, says, his, biographer, totally, rejected, the, widespread, english, view, that, the, irish, had, no, taste, for, justice, common, sense, moderation, or, national, prosperity, and, looked, only, to, perpetual, strife, and, dissension, the, problem, for, gladstone, was, that, his, rural, english, supporters, would, not, support, home, rule, for, ireland, a, large, faction, of, liberals, led, by, joseph, chamberlain, formed, a, unionist, faction, that, supported, the, conservative, party, whenever, the, liberals, were, out, of, power, home, rule, proposals, languished, gladstone, supported, the, london, dockers, in, their, strike, of, 1889, after, their, victory, he, gave, a, speech, at, hawarden, on, 23, september, in, which, he, said, in, the, common, interests, of, humanity, this, remarkable, strike, and, the, results, of, this, strike, which, have, tended, somewhat, to, strengthen, the, condition, of, labour, in, the, face, of, capital, is, the, record, of, what, we, ought, to, regard, as, satisfactory, as, a, real, social, advance, tends, to, a, fair, principle, of, division, of, the, fruits, of, industry, this, speech, has, been, described, by, eugenio, biagini, as, having, no, parallel, in, the, rest, of, europe, except, in, the, rhetoric, of, the, toughest, socialist, leaders, visitors, at, hawarden, in, october, were, shocked, by, some, rather, wild, language, on, the, dock, labourers, question, gladstone, was, impressed, with, workers, unconnected, with, the, dockers, dispute, who, intended, to, make, common, cause, in, the, interests, of, justice, on, 23, october, at, southport, gladstone, delivered, a, speech, where, he, said, that, the, right, to, combination, which, in, london, was, innocent, and, lawful, in, ireland, would, be, penal, and, punished, by, imprisonment, with, hard, labour, gladstone, believed, that, the, right, to, combination, used, by, british, workers, was, in, jeopardy, when, it, could, be, denied, to, irish, workers, in, october, 1890, gladstone, at, midlothian, claimed, that, competition, between, capital, and, labour, where, it, has, gone, to, sharp, issues, where, there, have, been, strikes, on, one, side, and, lock, outs, on, the, other, i, believe, that, in, the, main, and, as, a, general, rule, the, labouring, man, has, been, in, the, right, on, 11, december, 1891, gladstone, said, that, it, is, a, lamentable, fact, if, in, the, midst, of, our, civilisation, and, at, the, close, of, the, nineteenth, century, the, workhouse, is, all, that, can, be, offered, to, the, industrious, labourer, at, the, end, of, a, long, and, honourable, life, i, do, not, enter, into, the, question, now, in, detail, i, do, not, say, it, is, an, easy, one, i, do, not, say, that, it, will, be, solved, in, a, moment, but, i, do, say, this, that, until, society, is, able, to, offer, to, the, industrious, labourer, at, the, end, of, a, long, and, blameless, life, something, better, than, the, workhouse, society, will, not, have, discharged, its, duties, to, its, poorer, members, on, 24, march, 1892, gladstone, said, that, the, liberals, had, come, generally, to, the, conclusion, that, there, is, something, painful, in, the, condition, of, the, rural, labourer, in, this, great, respect, that, it, is, hard, even, for, the, industrious, and, sober, man, under, ordinary, conditions, to, secure, a, provision, for, his, own, old, age, very, large, propositions, involving, some, of, them, very, novel, and, very, wide, principles, have, been, submitted, to, the, public, for, the, purpose, of, securing, such, a, provision, by, means, independent, of, the, labourer, himself, our, duty, to, develop, in, the, first, instance, every, means, that, we, may, possibly, devise, whereby, if, possible, the, labourer, may, be, able, to, make, this, provision, for, himself, or, to, approximate, towards, making, such, provision, far, more, efficaciously, and, much, more, closely, than, he, can, now, do, gladstone, wrote, on, 16, july, 1892, in, autobiographica, that, in, 1834, the, government, did, themselves, high, honour, by, the, new, poor, law, act, which, rescued, the, english, peasantry, from, the, total, loss, of, their, independence, there, were, many, who, disagreed, with, him, gladstone, wrote, to, herbert, spencer, who, contributed, the, introduction, to, a, collection, of, anti, socialist, essays, a, plea, for, liberty, 1891, that, i, ask, to, make, reserves, and, of, one, passage, which, will, be, easily, guessed, i, am, unable, even, to, perceive, the, relevancy, but, speaking, generally, i, have, read, this, masterly, argument, with, warm, admiration, and, with, the, earnest, hope, that, it, may, attract, all, the, attention, which, it, so, well, deserves, the, passage, gladstone, alluded, to, was, one, where, spencer, had, spoken, of, the, behaviour, of, the, so, called, liberal, party, the, general, election, of, 1892, resulted, in, a, minority, liberal, government, with, gladstone, as, prime, minister, the, electoral, address, had, promised, irish, home, rule, and, the, disestablishment, of, the, scottish, and, welsh, churches, in, february, 1893, he, introduced, the, second, home, rule, bill, which, was, passed, in, the, commons, at, the, second, reading, on, 21, april, by, 43, votes, and, the, third, reading, on, 1, september, by, 34, votes, the, house, of, lords, defeated, the, bill, by, voting, against, it, by, 419, votes, to, 41, on, 8, september, the, elementary, education, blind, and, deaf, children, act, passed, in, 1893, required, local, authorities, to, provide, separate, education, for, blind, and, deaf, children, conservative, mp, colonel, howard, vincent, questioned, gladstone, in, the, commons, on, what, his, government, would, do, about, unemployment, on, 1, september, 1893, gladstone, replied, i, cannot, help, regretting, that, the, honourable, and, gallant, gentleman, has, felt, it, his, duty, to, put, the, question, it, is, put, under, circumstances, that, naturally, belong, to, one, of, those, fluctuations, in, the, condition, of, trade, which, however, unfortunate, and, lamentable, they, may, be, recur, from, time, to, time, undoubtedly, i, think, that, questions, of, this, kind, whatever, be, the, intention, of, the, questioner, have, a, tendency, to, produce, in, the, minds, of, people, or, to, suggest, to, the, people, that, these, fluctuations, can, be, corrected, by, the, action, of, the, executive, government, anything, that, contributes, to, such, an, impression, inflicts, an, injury, upon, the, labouring, population, in, december, 1893, an, opposition, motion, proposed, by, lord, george, hamilton, called, for, an, expansion, of, the, royal, navy, gladstone, opposed, increasing, public, expenditure, on, the, naval, estimates, in, the, tradition, of, free, trade, liberalism, of, his, earlier, political, career, as, chancellor, all, his, cabinet, colleagues, believed, in, some, expansion, of, the, navy, he, declared, in, the, commons, on, 19, december, that, naval, rearmament, would, commit, the, government, to, expenditure, over, a, number, of, years, and, would, subvert, the, principle, of, annual, account, annual, proposition, annual, approval, by, the, house, of, commons, which, is, the, only, way, of, maintaining, regularity, and, that, regularity, is, the, only, talisman, which, will, secure, parliamentary, control, in, january, 1894, gladstone, wrote, that, he, would, not, break, to, pieces, the, continuous, action, of, my, political, life, nor, trample, on, the, tradition, received, from, every, colleague, who, has, ever, been, my, teacher, by, supporting, naval, rearmament, gladstone, also, opposed, chancellor, sir, william, harcourt, s, proposal, to, implement, a, graduated, death, duty, in, a, fragment, of, autobiography, dated, 25, july, 1894, gladstone, denounced, the, tax, as, by, far, the, most, radical, measure, of, my, lifetime, i, do, not, object, to, the, principle, of, graduated, taxation, for, the, just, principle, of, the, ability, to, pay, is, not, determined, simply, by, the, amount, of, income, but, so, far, as, i, understand, the, present, measure, of, finance, from, the, partial, reports, i, have, received, i, find, it, too, violent, it, involves, a, great, departure, from, the, methods, of, political, action, established, in, this, country, where, reforms, and, especially, financial, reforms, have, always, been, considerate, and, even, tender, i, do, not, yet, see, the, ground, on, which, it, can, be, justly, held, that, any, one, description, of, property, should, be, more, heavily, burdened, than, others, unless, moral, and, social, grounds, can, be, shown, first, but, in, this, case, the, reasons, drawn, from, those, sources, seem, rather, to, verge, in, the, opposite, direction, for, real, property, has, more, of, presumptive, connection, with, the, discharge, of, duty, than, that, which, is, ranked, as, personal, the, aspect, of, the, measure, is, not, satisfactory, to, a, man, of, my, traditions, and, these, traditions, lie, near, the, roots, of, my, being, for, the, sudden, introduction, of, such, change, there, is, i, think, no, precedent, in, the, history, of, this, country, and, the, severity, of, the, blow, is, greatly, aggravated, in, moral, effect, by, the, fact, that, it, is, dealt, only, to, a, handful, of, individuals, gladstone, had, his, last, audience, with, queen, victoria, on, 28, february, 1894, and, chaired, his, last, cabinet, on, 1, march, the, last, of, 556, he, had, chaired, on, that, day, he, gave, his, last, speech, to, the, house, of, commons, saying, that, the, government, would, withdraw, opposition, to, the, lords, amendments, to, the, local, government, bill, under, protest, and, that, it, was, a, controversy, which, when, once, raised, must, go, forward, to, an, issue, he, resigned, from, the, premiership, on, 2, march, the, queen, did, not, ask, gladstone, who, should, succeed, him, but, sent, for, lord, rosebery, gladstone, would, have, advised, on, lord, spencer, he, retained, his, seat, in, the, house, of, commons, until, 1895, he, was, not, offered, a, peerage, having, earlier, declined, an, earldom, gladstone, is, both, the, oldest, person, to, form, a, government, aged, 82, at, his, appointment, and, the, oldest, person, to, occupy, the, premiership, being, 84, at, his, resignation, in, 1895, at, the, age, of, 85, gladstone, bequeathed, 40, 000, equivalent, to, approximately, 5, 84, million, today, and, much, of, his, 32, 000, volume, library, to, found, st, deiniol, s, library, in, hawarden, wales, it, had, begun, with, just, 5, 000, items, at, his, father, s, home, fasque, which, were, transferred, to, hawarden, for, research, in, 1851, on, 8, january, 1896, in, conversation, with, l, a, tollemache, gladstone, explained, that, i, am, not, so, much, afraid, of, democracy, or, of, science, as, of, the, love, of, money, this, seems, to, me, to, be, a, growing, evil, also, there, is, a, danger, from, the, growth, of, that, dreadful, military, spirit, on, 13, january, gladstone, claimed, he, had, strong, conservative, instincts, and, that, in, all, matters, of, custom, and, tradition, even, the, tories, look, upon, me, as, the, chief, conservative, that, is, on, 15, january, gladstone, wrote, to, james, bryce, describing, himself, as, a, dead, man, one, fundamentally, a, peel, cobden, man, in, 1896, in, his, last, noteworthy, speech, he, denounced, armenian, massacres, by, ottomans, in, a, talk, delivered, at, liverpool, on, 2, january, 1897, gladstone, wrote, to, francis, hirst, on, being, unable, to, draft, a, preface, to, a, book, on, liberalism, i, venture, on, assuring, you, that, i, regard, the, design, formed, by, you, and, your, friends, with, sincere, interest, and, in, particular, wish, well, to, all, the, efforts, you, may, make, on, behalf, of, individual, freedom, and, independence, as, opposed, to, what, is, termed, collectivism, in, the, early, months, of, 1897, gladstone, and, his, wife, stayed, in, cannes, gladstone, met, queen, victoria, and, she, shook, hands, with, him, for, to, his, recollection, the, first, time, in, the, 50, years, he, had, known, her, one, of, the, gladstones,

at, the, chancel, step, one, of, the, clergy, sprang, involuntarily, to, his, assistance, but, retreated, with, haste, so, withering, was, the, fire, which, flashed, from, those, failing, eyes, the, gladstones, returned, to, hawarden, castle, at, the, end, of, march, and, he, received, the, colonial, premiers, in, their, visit, for, the, queen, s, jubilee, at, a, dinner, in, november, with, edward, hamilton, his, former, private, secretary, hamilton, noted, that, what, is, now, uppermost, in, his, mind, is, what, he, calls, the, spirit, of, jingoism, under, the, name, of, imperialism, which, is, now, so, prevalent, gladstone, riposted, it, was, enough, to, make, peel, and, cobden, turn, in, their, graves, on, the, advice, of, his, doctor, samuel, habershon, in, the, aftermath, of, an, attack, of, facial, neuralgia, gladstone, stayed, at, cannes, from, the, end, of, november, 1897, to, mid, february, 1898, he, gave, an, interview, for, the, daily, telegraph, gladstone, then, travelled, to, bournemouth, where, a, swelling, on, his, palate, was, diagnosed, as, cancer, by, the, leading, cancer, surgeon, sir, thomas, smith, on, 18, march, on, 22, march, he, retired, to,

with, stephen, gladstone, shall, i, ever, forget, the, last, friday, in, passion, week, when, i, gave, him, the, last, holy, communion, that, i, was, allowed, to, administer, to, him, it, was, early, in, the, morning, he, was, obliged, to, be, in, bed, and, he, was, ordered, to, remain, there, but, the, time, had, come, for, the, confession, of, sin, and, the, receiving, of, absolution, out, of, his, bed, he, came, alone, he, knelt, in, the, presence, of, his, god, till, the, absolution, has, been, spoken, and, the, sacred, elements, received, gladstone, died, on, 19, may, 1898, at, hawarden, castle, hawarden, aged, 88, he, had, been, cared, for, by, his, daughter, helen, who, had, resigned, from, her, job, to, care, for, her, father, and, mother, the, cause, of, death, is, officially, recorded, as, syncope, senility, syncope, meant, failure, of, the, heart, and, senility, in, the, 19th, century, was, an, infirmity, of, advanced, old, age, rather, than, a, loss, of, mental, faculties, the, house, of, commons, adjourned, on, the, afternoon, of, gladstone, s, death, with, a, j, balfour, giving, notice, for, an, address, to, the, queen, praying, for, a, public, funeral, and, a, public, memorial, in, westminster, abbey, the, day, after, both, houses, of, parliament, approved, the, address, and, herbert, gladstone, accepted, a, public, funeral, on, behalf, of, the, gladstone, family, his, coffin, was, transported, on, the, london, underground, before, his, state, funeral, at, westminster, abbey, at, which, the, prince, of, wales, the, future, king, edward, vii, and, the, duke, of, york, the, future, king, george, v, acted, as, pallbearers, his, wife, catherine, gladstone, n, e, glynne, died, two, years, later, on, 14, june, 1900, and, was, buried, next, to, him, gladstone, s, intensely, religious, mother, was, an, evangelical, of, scottish, episcopal, origins, and, his, father, joined, the, church, of, england, having, been, a, presbyterian, when, he, first, settled, in, liverpool, as, a, boy, william, was, baptised, into, the, church, of, england, he, rejected, a, call, to, enter, the, ministry, and, on, this, his, conscience, always, tormented, him, in, compensation, he, aligned, his, politics, with, the, evangelical, faith, in, which, he, fervently, believed, in, 1838, gladstone, nearly, ruined, his, career, when, he, tried, to, force, a, religious, mission, upon, the, conservative, party, his, book, the, state, in, its, relations, with, the, church, argued, that, england, had, neglected, its, great, duty, to, the, church, of, england, he, announced, that, since, that, church, possessed, a, monopoly, of, religious, truth, nonconformists, and, roman, catholics, ought, to, be, excluded, from, all, government, positions, the, historian, thomas, babington, macaulay, and, other, critics, ridiculed, his, arguments, and, refuted, them, sir, robert, peel, gladstone, s, chief, was, outraged, because, this, would, upset, the, delicate, political, issue, of, catholic, emancipation, and, anger, the, nonconformists, since, peel, greatly, admired, his, prot, g, he, redirected, his, focus, from, theology, to, finance, gladstone, altered, his, approach, to, religious, problems, which, always, held, first, place, in, his, mind, before, entering, parliament, he, had, already, substituted, a, high, church, anglican, attitude, with, its, dependence, on, authority, and, tradition, for, the, evangelical, outlook, of, his, boyhood, with, its, reliance, upon, the, direct, inspiration, of, the, bible, in, middle, life, he, decided, that, the, individual, conscience, would, have, to, replace, authority, as, the, inner, citadel, of, the, church, that, view, of, the, individual, conscience, affected, his, political, outlook, and, changed, him, gradually, from, a, conservative, into, a, liberal, initially, a, disciple, of, high, toryism, gladstone, s, maiden, speech, as, a, young, tory, was, a, defence, of, the, rights, of, west, indian, sugar, plantation, magnates, slave, owners, among, whom, his, father, was, prominent, he, immediately, came, under, attack, from, anti, slavery, elements, he, also, surprised, the, duke, by, urging, the, need, to, increase, pay, for, unskilled, factory, workers, gladstone, s, early, attitude, towards, slavery, was, highly, shaped, by, his, father, sir, john, gladstone, one, of, the, largest, slave, owners, in, the, british, empire, gladstone, wanted, gradual, rather, than, immediate, emancipation, and, proposed, that, slaves, should, serve, a, period, of, apprenticeship, after, being, freed, they, also, opposed, the, international, slave, trade, which, lowered, the, value, of, the, slaves, the, father, already, owned, the, antislavery, movement, demanded, the, immediate, abolition, of, slavery, gladstone, opposed, this, and, said, in, 1832, that, emancipation, should, come, after, moral, emancipation, through, the, adoption, of, education, and, the, inculcation, of, honest, and, industrious, habits, among, the, slaves, then, with, the, utmost, speed, that, prudence, will, permit, we, shall, arrive, at, that, exceedingly, desired, consummation, the, utter, extinction, of, slavery, in, 1831, when, the, oxford, union, considered, a, motion, in, favour, of, the, immediate, emancipation, of, the, slaves, in, the, west, indies, gladstone, moved, an, amendment, in, favour, of, gradual, manumission, along, with, better, protection, for, the, personal, and, civil, rights, of, the, slaves, and, better, provision, for, their, christian, education, his, early, parliamentary, speeches, followed, a, similar, line, in, june, 1833, gladstone, concluded, his, speech, on, the, slavery, question, by, declaring, that, though, he, had, dwelt, on, the, dark, side, of, the, issue, he, looked, forward, to, a, safe, and, gradual, emancipation, in, 1834, when, slavery, was, abolished, across, the, british, empire, the, owners, were, paid, full, value, for, the, slaves, gladstone, helped, his, father, obtain, 106, 769, equivalent, to, 12, 960, 000, in, 2023, in, official, reimbursement, by, the, government, for, the, 2, 508, slaves, he, owned, across, nine, plantations, in, the, caribbean, in, later, years, gladstone, s, attitude, towards, slavery, became, more, critical, as, his, father, s, influence, over, his, politics, diminished, in, 1844, gladstone, broke, with, his, father, when, as, president, of, the, board, of, trade, he, advanced, proposals, to, halve, duties, on, foreign, sugar, not, produced, by, slave, labour, in, order, to, secure, the, effectual, exclusion, of, slave, grown, sugar, and, to, encourage, brazil, and, spain, to, end, slavery, sir, john, gladstone, who, opposed, any, reduction, in, duties, on, foreign, sugar, wrote, a, letter, to, the, times, criticizing, the, measure, looking, back, late, in, life, gladstone, named, the, abolition, of, slavery, as, one, of, ten, great, achievements, of, the, previous, sixty, years, where, the, masses, had, been, right, and, the, upper, classes, had, been, wrong, shortly, after, the, outbreak, of, the, american, civil, war, gladstone, wrote, to, his, friend, the, duchess, of, sutherland, that, the, principle, announced, by, the, vice, president, of, the, south, which, asserts, the, superiority, of, the, white, man, and, therewith, founds, on, it, his, right, to, hold, the, black, in, slavery, i, think, that, principle, detestable, and, i, am, wholly, with, the, opponents, of, it, but, that, he, felt, that, the, north, was, wrong, to, try, to, restore, the, union, by, military, force, which, he, believed, would, end, in, failure, in, a, memorandum, to, the, cabinet, later, that, month, gladstone, wrote, that, although, he, believed, the, confederacy, would, probably, win, the, war, it, was, seriously, tainted, by, its, connection, with, slavery, and, argued, that, the, european, powers, should, use, their, influence, on, the, south, to, effect, the, mitigation, or, removal, of, slavery, gladstone, s, early, attempts, to, find, a, wife, proved, unsuccessful, having, been, rejected, in, 1835, by, caroline, eliza, farquhar, daughter, of, sir, thomas, harvie, farquhar, 2nd, baronet, and, again, in, 1837, by, lady, frances, harriet, douglas, daughter, of, george, douglas, 17th, earl, of, morton, the, following, year, having, met, her, in, 1834, at, the, london, home, of, old, etonian, friend, and, then, fellow, conservative, mp, james, milnes, gaskell, he, married, catherine, glynne, on, 25, july, 1839, a, joint, wedding, shared, with, catherine, s, sister, mary, glynne, and, betrothed, george, lyttelton, to, whom, he, remained, married, until, his, death, 59, years, later, they, had, eight, children, together, gladstone, s, eldest, son, william, known, as, willy, to, distinguish, him, from, his, father, and, youngest, herbert, both, became, members, of, parliament, henry, and, herbert, became, peers, a, baron, and, a, viscount, and, so, members, of, the, house, of, lords, william, henry, predeceased, his, father, by, seven, years, gladstone, s, private, secretary, was, his, nephew, spencer, lyttelton, two, of, gladstone, s, sons, and, a, grandson, william, glynne, charles, gladstone, followed, him, into, parliament, making, for, four, generations, of, mps, in, total, one, of, his, collateral, descendants, george, freeman, has, been, the, conservative, member, of, parliament, for, mid, norfolk, since, 2010, sir, albert, gladstone, 5th, baronet, an, olympic, games, rowing, champion, and, sir, charles, gladstone, 6th, baronet, from, whom, the, 7th, and, 8th, baronets, are, descended, were, also, grandsons, the, historian, h, c, g, matthew, states, that, gladstone, s, chief, legacy, lay, in, three, areas, his, financial, policy, his, support, for, home, rule, devolution, that, modified, the, view, of, the, unitary, state, of, the, united, kingdom, and, his, idea, of, a, progressive, reforming, party, broadly, based, and, capable, of, accommodating, and, conciliating, varying, interests, along, with, his, speeches, at, mass, public, meetings, historian, walter, l, arnstein, concludes, notable, as, the, gladstonian, reforms, had, been, they, had, almost, all, remained, within, the, 19th, century, liberal, tradition, of, gradually, removing, the, religious, economic, and, political, barriers, that, prevented, men, of, varied, creeds, and, classes, from, exercising, their, individual, talents, in, order, to, improve, themselves, and, their, society, as, the, third, quarter, of, the, century, drew, to, a, close, the, essential, bastions, of, victorianism, still, held, firm, respectability, a, government, of, aristocrats, and, gentlemen, now, influenced, not, only, by, middle, class, merchants, and, manufacturers, but, also, by, industrious, working, people, a, prosperity, that, seemed, to, rest, largely, on, the, tenets, of, laissez, faire, economics, and, a, britannia, that, ruled, the, waves, and, many, a, dominion, beyond, lord, acton, wrote, in, 1880, that, he, considered, gladstone, one, of, the, three, greatest, liberals, along, with, edmund, burke, and, lord, macaulay, in, 1909, the, liberal, chancellor, david, lloyd, george, introduced, his, people, s, budget, the, first, budget, which, aimed, to, redistribute, wealth, the, liberal, statesman, lord, rosebery, ridiculed, it, by, asserting, gladstone, would, reject, it, because, in, his, eyes, and, in, my, eyes, too, as, his, humble, disciple, liberalism, and, liberty, were, cognate, terms, they, were, twin, sisters, lloyd, george, had, written, in, 1913, that, the, liberals, were, carving, the, last, few, columns, out, of, the, gladstonian, quarry, lloyd, george, said, of, gladstone, in, 1915, what, a, man, he, was, head, and, shoulders, above, anyone, else, i, have, ever, seen, in, the, house, of, commons, i, did, not, like, him, much, he, hated, nonconformists, and, welsh, nonconformists, in, particular, and, he, had, no, real, sympathy, with, the, working, classes, but, he, was, far, and, away, the, best, parliamentary, speaker, i, have, ever, heard, he, was, not, so, good, in, exposition, asquithian, liberals, continued, to, advocate, traditional, gladstonian, policies, of, sound, finance, peaceful, foreign, relations, and, the, better, treatment, of, ireland, they, often, compared, lloyd, george, unfavourably, with, gladstone, writing, in, 1944, the, classical, liberal, economist, friedrich, hayek, said, of, the, change, in, political, attitudes, that, had, occurred, since, the, great, war, perhaps, nothing, shows, this, change, more, clearly, than, that, while, there, is, no, lack, of, sympathetic, treatment, of, bismarck, in, contemporary, english, literature, the, name, of, gladstone, is, rarely, mentioned, by, the, younger, generation, without, a, sneer, over, his, victorian, morality, and, naive, utopianism, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, thatcherite, conservatives, began, to, claim, association, with, gladstone, and, his, economic, policies, margaret, thatcher, proclaimed, in, 1983, we, have, a, duty, to, make, sure, that, every, penny, piece, we, raise, in, taxation, is, spent, wisely, and, well, for, it, is, our, party, which, is, dedicated, to, good, housekeeping, indeed, i, would, not, mind, betting, that, if, mr, gladstone, were, alive, today, he, would, apply, to, join, the, conservative, party, in, 1996, she, said, the, kind, of, conservatism, which, he, and, i, favoured, would, be, best, described, as, liberal, in, the, old, fashioned, sense, and, i, mean, the, liberalism, of, mr, gladstone, not, of, the, latter, day, collectivists, nigel, lawson, one, of, thatcher, s, chancellors, called, gladstone, the, greatest, chancellor, of, all, time, a, j, p, taylor, wrote, william, ewart, gladstone, was, the, greatest, political, figure, of, the, nineteenth, century, i, do, not, mean, by, that, that, he, was, necessarily, the, greatest, statesman, certainly, not, the, most, successful, what, i, mean, is, that, he, dominated, the, scene, historical, writers, have, often, played, disraeli, and, gladstone, against, each, other, as, great, rivals, roland, quinault, however, cautions, us, not, to, exaggerate, the, confrontation, they, were, not, direct, antagonists, for, most, of, their, political, careers, indeed, initially, they, were, both, loyal, to, the, tory, party, the, church, and, the, landed, interest, although, their, paths, diverged, over, the, repeal, of, the, corn, laws, in, 1846, and, later, over, fiscal, policy, more, generally, it, was, not, until, the, later, 1860s, that, their, differences, over, parliamentary, reform, irish, and, church, policy, assumed, great, partisan, significance, even, then, their, personal, relations, remained, fairly, cordial, until, their, dispute, over, the, eastern, question, in, the, later, 1870s, gladstone, was, popularly, known, in, his, later, years, as, the, grand, old, man, or, g, o, m, the, term, was, used, occasionally, during, the, midlothian, election, campaign, first, became, widely, associated, with, him, during, the, 1880, general, election, and, was, ubiquitous, in, the, press, by, 1882, henry, labouch, re, and, sir, stafford, northcote, have, both, been, credited, with, coining, it, it, appears, to, have, been, in, use, before, either, of, them, used, it, publicly, though, they, may, have, helped, popularise, it, while, it, was, originally, used, to, show, affectionate, reverence, it, was, quickly, adopted, more, sarcastically, by, his, opponents, using, it, to, emphasise, his, age, the, acronym, was, sometimes, satirised, as, god, s, only, mistake, or, after, the, fall, of, khartoum, inverted, to, m, o, g, murderer, of, gordon, disraeli, is, often, credited, with, the, former, but, lord, salisbury, is, a, more, likely, origin, the, term, is, still, widely, used, today, and, is, virtually, synonymous, with, gladstone, gladstone, s, burial, in, 1898, was, commemorated, in, a, poem, by, william, mcgonagall, since, 1937, gladstone, has, been, portrayed, some, 37, times, in, film, and, television, portrayals, include, there, was, one, man, who, not, only, united, high, ability, with, unparalleled, opportunity, but, also, knew, how, to, turn, budgets, into, political, triumphs, and, who, stands, in, history, as, the, greatest, english, financier, of, economic, liberalism, gladstone, the, greatest, feature, of, gladstonian, finance, was, that, it, expressed, with, ideal, adequacy, both, the, whole, civilisation, and, the, needs, of, the, time, ex, visu, of, the, conditions, of, the, country, to, which, it, was, to, apply, or, to, put, it, slightly, differently, that, it, translated, a, social, political, and, economic, vision, which, was, comprehensive, as, well, as, historically, correct, into, the, clauses, of, a, set, of, co, ordinated, fiscal, measures, gladstonian, finance, was, the, finance, of, the, system, of, natural, liberty, laissez, faire, and, free, trade, the, most, important, thing, was, to, remove, fiscal, obstructions, to, private, activity, and, for, this, in, turn, it, was, necessary, to, keep, public, expenditure, low, retrenchment, was, the, victorious, slogan, of, the, day, it, means, the, reduction, of, the, functions, of, the, state, to, a, minimum, retrenchment, means, rationalisation, of, the, remaining, functions, of, the, state, which, among, other, things, implies, as, small, a, military, establishment, as, possible, the, resulting, economic, development, would, in, addition, so, it, was, believed, make, social, expenditures, largely, superfluous, equally, important, was, it, to, raise, the, revenue, that, would, still, have, to, be, raised, in, such, a, way, as, to, deflect, economic, behaviour, as, little, as, possible, from, what, it, would, have, been, in, the, absence, of, all, taxation, taxation, for, revenue, only, and, since, the, profit, motive, and, the, propensity, to, save, were, considered, of, paramount, importance, for, the, economic, progress, of, all, classes, this, meant, in, particular, that, taxation, should, as, little, as, possible, interfere, with, the, net, earnings, of, a, business, as, regards, indirect, taxes, the, principle, of, least, interference, was, interpreted, by, gladstone, to, mean, that, taxation, should, be, concentrated, on, a, few, important, articles, leaving, the, rest, free, last, but, not, least, we, have, the, principle, of, the, balanced, budget, upon, a, review, of, the, finance, of, the, last, five, years, we, are, enabled, to, state, that, notwithstanding, the, purchase, of, the, telegraphs, for, a, sum, exceeding, 9, 000, 000, l, the, aggregate, amount, of, the, national, debt, has, been, reduced, by, more, than, 20, 000, 000, l, that, taxes, have, been, lowered, or, abolished, over, and, above, any, amount, imposed, to, the, extent, of, 12, 500, 000, l, that, during, the, present, year, the, alabama, indemnity, has, been, paid, and, the, charge, of, the, ashantee, war, will, be, met, out, of, revenue, and, that, in, estimating, as, we, can, now, venture, to, do, the, income, of, the, coming, year, and, for, the, moment, assuming, the, general, scale, of, charge, to, continue, as, it, was, fixed, during, the, last, session, we, do, not, fear, to, anticipate, as, the, probable, balance, a, surplus, exceeding, rather, than, falling, short, of, 5, 000, 000, l, the, first, item, which, i, have, to, set, down, in, the, financial, arrangements, proper, for, the, first, year, is, relief, but, relief, coupled, with, reform, of, local, taxation, it, has, been, the, happy, fortune, of, mr, lowe, to, bring, it, down, first, from, 6d, to, 4d, and, then, from, 4d, to, 3d, in, the, pound, the, proceeds, of, the, income, tax, for, the, present, year, are, expected, to, be, between, 5, 000, 000, l, and, 6, 000, 000, l, and, at, a, sacrifice, for, the, financial, year, of, something, less, than, 5, 500, 000, l, the, country, may, enjoy, the, advantage, and, relief, of, its, total, repeal, i, do, not, hesitate, to, affirm, that, an, effort, should, now, be, made, to, attain, this, advantage, nor, to, declare, that, according, to, my, judgment, it, is, in, present, circumstances, practicable, we, ought, not, to, aid, the, rates, and, remove, the, income, tax, without, giving, to, the, general, consumer, and, giving, him, simultaneously, some, marked, relief, in, the, class, of, articles, of, popular, consumption, i, for, one, could, not, belong, to, a, government, which, did, not, on, every, occasion, seek, to, enlarge, its, resources, by, a, wise, economy
