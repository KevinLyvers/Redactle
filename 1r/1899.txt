sportswriter, was, prompted, to, say, henry, aaron, led, the, league, in, everything, except, hotel, accommodations, aaron, s, time, with, the, braves, did, not, come, without, problems, he, was, one, of, the, first, african, americans, to, play, in, the, league, the, 1950s, were, a, period, of, racial, segregation, in, parts, of, the, united, states, especially, the, southeastern, portion, of, the, country, when, aaron, traveled, around, jacksonville, florida, and, the, surrounding, areas, he, was, often, separated, from, his, team, because, of, jim, crow, laws, in, most, circumstances, the, team, was, responsible, for, arranging, housing, and, meals, for, its, players, but, aaron, often, had, to, make, his, own, arrangements, the, braves, manager, ben, geraghty, tried, his, best, to, help, aaron, on, and, off, the, field, former, braves, minor, league, player, and, sportswriter, pat, jordan, said, aaron, gave, much, of, the, credit, for, his, own, swift, rise, to, stardom, that, same, year, aaron, met, his, future, wife, barbara, lucas, the, night, they, met, lucas, decided, to, attend, the, braves, game, aaron, singled, doubled, and, hit, a, home, run, in, the, game,

fishing, aaron, spent, the, winter, of, 1953, playing, in, puerto, rico, mickey, owen, the, team, s, manager, helped, aaron, with, his, batting, stance, until, then, aaron, had, hit, most, pitches, to, left, field, or, center, field, but, after, working, with, owen, aaron, was, able, to, hit, the, ball, more, effectively, all, over, the, field, during, his, stay, in, puerto, rico, owen, also, helped, aaron, transition, from, second, base, to, the, outfield, aaron, had, not, played, well, at, second, base, but, owen, noted, that, aaron, could, catch, fly, balls, and, throw, them, well, from, the, outfield, to, the, infield, the, stint, in, puerto, rico, also, allowed, aaron, to, avoid, being, drafted, into, military, service, though, the, korean, war, was, over, people, were, still, being, drafted, the, braves, were, able, to, speak, to, the, draft, board, making, the, case, that, aaron, could, be, the, player, to, integrate, the, southern, association, the, following, season, with, the, atlanta, crackers, the, board, appears, to, have, been, convinced, as, aaron, was, not, drafted, in, 1954, aaron, attended, spring, training, with, the, major, league, club, although, he, was, on, the, roster, of, its, farm, club, milwaukee, manager, charley, grimm, later, stated, from, the, start, he, did, so, well, i, knew, we, were, going, to, have, to, carry, him, on, march, 13,

training, start, for, the, braves, major, league, team, playing, in, left, field, and, hitting, a, home, run, this, led, aaron, to, a, major, league, contract, signed, on, the, final, day, of, spring,

before, he, suffered, a, fractured, ankle, on, september, 5, he, then, changed, his, number, to, 44, which, would, turn, out, to, look, like, a, lucky, number, for, the, slugger, aaron, would, hit, 44, home, runs, in, four, different, seasons, and, he, hit, his, record, breaking, 715th, career, home, run, off, dodgers, pitcher, al, downing, who, coincidentally, also, wore, number, 44, at, this,

publicly, as, hank, in, order, to, suggest, more, accessibility, the, nickname, quickly, gained, currency, but, henry, continued, to, be, cited, frequently, in, the, media, both, sometimes, appearing, in, the, same, article, and, aaron, would, answer, to, either, one, during, his, rookie, year, his, other, well, known, nicknames, hammerin, hank, by, teammates, and, bad, henry, by, opposing,

therefore, going, to, have, aaron, sit, out, the, first, three, games, of, the, season, but, baseball, commissioner, bowie, kuhn, ruled, that, he, had, to, play, two, games, in, the, first, series,

knew, my, mother, could, hug, so, tight, though, he, later, learned, that, aaron, s, mother, kept, hugging, him, because, she, was, worried, someone, could, try, to, shoot, aaron, and, she, thought, nobody, would, try, to, shoot, him, if, she, was, hugging, him, braves, announcer, milo, hamilton, calling, the, game, on, wsb, radio, described, the, scene, as, aaron, broke, the, record, henry,

is, getting, a, standing, ovation, in, the, deep, south, for, breaking, a, record, of, an, all, time, baseball, idol, and, it, is, a, great, moment, for, all, of, us, and, particularly, for, henry, aaron, and, for, the, first, time, in, a, long, time, that, poker, face, in, aaron, shows, the, tremendous, strain, and, relief, of, what, it, must, have, been, like, to, live, with, for, the, past, several, months, on, october, 2, 1974, aaron, hit, his, 733rd, home, run, in, his, last, at, bat, as, a, braves, player, aaron, commented, after, the, game, that, it, was, his, last, time, as, a,

he, retired, but, the, role, would, be, more, in, public, relations, rather, than, one, where, he, could, evaluate, talent, at, the, end, of, the, season, aaron, who, had, a, prior, relationship, with, brewers, owner, bud, selig, requested, a, trade, to, milwaukee, he, was, acquired, by, the, milwaukee, brewers, for, dave, may, thirty, one, days, later, on, november, 2, minor, league, right,

performance, the, season, before, to, make, a, television, commercial, that, aired, during, super, bowl, xxxvi, in, which, aaron, jokingly, tried, to, persuade, bonds, to, retire, before, breaking, the, record, as, bonds, began, to, close, in, on, the, record, during, the, 2007, season, aaron, let, it, be, known, that, although, he, recognized, bonds, achievements, he, would, not, be, present, when, bonds, broke, the, record, there, was, considerable, speculation, that, this, was, a, snubbing, of, bonds, based, on, the, widespread, belief, that, bonds, had, used, performance, enhancing, drugs, and, steroids, to, aid, his, achievement, however, some, observers, looked, back, on, aaron, s, personal, history, pointing, out, that, he, had, downplayed, his, own, breaking, of, babe, ruth, s, all, time, record, and, suggesting, aaron, was, simply, treating, bonds, in, a, similar, fashion, in, a, later, interview, with, atlanta, sportscasting, personality, chris, dimino, aaron, made, it, clear, his, reluctance, to, attend, any, celebration, of, a, new, home, run, record, was, based, upon, his, personal, conviction, that, baseball, is, not, about, breaking, records, but, simply, playing, to, the, best, of, one, s, potential, after, bonds, hit, his, record, breaking, 756th, home, run, on, august, 7, 2007, aaron, made, a, surprise, appearance, on, the, jumbotron, video, screen, at, at, t, park, in, san, francisco, to, congratulate, bonds, on, his, accomplishment, i, would, like, to, offer, my, congratulations, to, barry, bonds, on, becoming, baseball, s, career, home, run, leader, it, is, a, great, accomplishment, that, required, skill, longevity, and, determination, throughout, the, past, century, the, home, run, has, held, a, special, place, in, baseball, and, i, have, been, privileged, to, hold, this, record, for, 33, of, those, years, i, move, over, now, and, offer, my, best, wishes, to, barry, and, his, family, on, this, historical, achievement, my, hope, today, as, it, was, on, that, april, evening, in, 1974, is, that, the, achievement, of, this, record, will, inspire, others, to, chase, their, own, dreams, aaron, s, autobiography, i, had, a, hammer,
