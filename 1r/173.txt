through, her, extremely, detailed, and, professional, sketches, at, the, time, people, were, focused, on, postmodernism, designs, so, her, designs, were, a, different, approach, to, architecture,

architecture, magazines, before, construction, when, completed, it, only, served, as, a, fire, station, for, a, short, period, of, time, as, weil, am, rhein, soon, opened, their, own, fire, station, it, became, an, exhibit, space, instead, and, is, now, on, display, with, the, works, of, gehry, and, other, well, known, architects, it, was, the, launching, pad, of, her, architectural, career, in,

practice, zha, hadid, together, with, british, architectural, artist, brian, clarke, developed, an, unexecuted, collaborative, proposal, for, the, project, that, incorporated, integral, artworks, by,

complex, clarke, developed, a, new, type, of, mouth, blown, glass, for, the, scheme, which, he, christened, zaha, glas, later, reduced, to, three, buildings, the, project, which, experienced, delays, in, construction, was, completed, in, 2006, without, the, artwork, hadid, designed, a, public, housing, estate, in, berlin, 1986, 1993, and, organised, an, exhibition, the, great, utopia, 1992, at,

1976, winter, olympics, the, new, structure, was, to, contain, not, only, a, ski, jump, but, also, a, cafe, with, 150, seats, offering, a, 360, degree, view, of, the, mountains, hadid, had, to, fight, against, traditionalists, and, against, time, the, project, had, to, be, completed, in, one, year, before, the, next, international, competition, her, design, is, 48, metres, high, and, rests, on, a, base, seven, metres, by, seven, metres, she, described, it, as, an, organic, hybrid, a, cross, between, a, bridge, and, a, tower, which, by, its, form, gives, a, sense, of, movement, and, speed, at, the, end, of, the, 1990s, her, career, began, to, gather, momentum, as, she, won, commissions, for, two, museums, and, a, large, industrial, building, she, competed, against, rem, koolhaas, and,

but, the, project, demonstrated, hadid, s, ability, to, use, architectural, forms, to, create, interior, drama, including, its, central, element, a, 30, metre, long, black, stairway, that, passes, between, massive, curving, and, angular, concrete, walls, in, 2000, she, won, an, international, competition, for, the, phaeno, science, center, in, wolfsburg, germany, 2002, 2005, the, new, museum, was, only, a, little, larger, than, the, cincinnati, museum, with, 9, 000, square, metres, of, space, but, the, plan, was, much, more, ambitious, it, was, similar, in, concept, to, the, buildings, of, le, corbusier, raised, up, seven, metres, on, concrete, pylons, unlike, corbusier, s, buildings, she, planned, for, the, space, under, the, building, to, be, filled, with, activity, and, each, of, the, 10, massive, inverted, cone, shaped, columns, that, hold, up, the, building, contains, a, cafe, a, shop, or, a, museum, entrance, the, tilting, columns, reach, up, through, the, building, and, also, support, the, roof, the, museum, structure, resembles, an, enormous, ship, with, sloping, walls, and, asymmetric, scatterings, of, windows, and, the, interior, with, its, angular, columns, and, exposed, steel, roof, framework, gives, the, illusion, of, being, inside, a, working, vessel, or, laboratory, in, 2001, she, began, another, museum, project, an, extension, of, the, ordrupgaard,

building, for, the, factory, of, the, auto, manufacturer, bmw, in, leipzig, germany, the, three, assembly, buildings, adjoining, it, were, designed, by, other, architects, her, building, served, as, the, entrance, and, what, she, called, the, nerve, centre, of, the, complex, as, with, the, phaeno, science, center, the, building, is, hoisted, above, street, level, on, leaning, concrete, pylons, the, interior, contains, a, series, of, levels, and, floors, which, seem, to, cascade, sheltered, by, tilting, concrete, beams, and, a, roof, supported, by, steel, beams, in, the, shape, of, an, h, the, open, interior, inside, was, intended, she, wrote, to, avoid, the, traditional, segregation, of, working, groups, and, to, show, the, global, transparence, of, the, internal, organisation, of, the, enterprise, and, wrote, that, she, had, given, particular, attention, to, the, parking, lot, in, front, of, the, building, with, the, intent, she, wrote, of, transforming, it, into, a, dynamic, spectacle, of, its, own, in, 2004, she, won, the, pritzker, architecture, prize, the, most, prestigious, award, in, architecture, though, she, had, only, completed, four, buildings, the, vitra, fire,

pritzker, the, head, of, the, jury, announced, although, her, body, of, work, is, relatively, small, she, has, achieved, great, acclaim, and, her, energy, and, ideas, show, even, greater, promise, for, the, future, between, 1997, and, 2010, hadid, ventured, into, the, engineers, domain, of, bridge, construction, a, field, also, occupied, by, other, top, architects, including, norman, foster,

event, on, the, themes, of, water, and, durable, development, the, concrete, bridge, span, on, which, the, pavilion, rests, is, 85, metres, long, as, measured, from, the, exposition, site, to, an, island, in, the, ebro, river, the, bridge, carries, or, is, attached, to, four, tunnel, like, exhibition, spaces, she, termed, pods, which, spread, onto, the, island, for, a, total, length, of, 275, metres, the, pods, are, covered, with, a, skin, of, 26, 000, triangular, shingles, many, of, which, open, to, let, in, air, and, light, the, bridge, pavilion, characteristic, of, her, designs, and, buildings, of, the, period, is, composed, entirely, of, diagonal, slopes, and, curves, with, no, right, angles, of, orthogonal, forms, by, its, curving, shape, and, low, profile, the, bridge, pavilion, fits, smoothly, into, the, grassy, landscape, along, the, river, between, 1997, and, 2010, she, constructed, a, much, more, ambitious, bridge, the, sheikh, zayed, bridge, which, honors, sheikh, zayed, bin, sultan, al, nahyan, between, the, island, of, abu, dhabi, and, the, mainland, of, abu, dhabi, as, well, as, to, the, abu, dhabi, international, airport, both, the, design, of, the, bridge, and, the, lighting, consisting, of, gradually, changing, colours, were, designed, to, give, the, impression, of, movement, the, silhouette, of, the, bridge, is, a, wave, with, a, principal, arch, 235, metres, long, standing, 60, metres, above, the, water, the, total, span, of, four, lanes, is, 842, metres, 2, 762, feet, long, and, also, includes, pedestrian, walkways, the, bridge, was,

was, designed, and, built, between, 1998, and, 2010, the, main, theme, of, its, architecture, is, the, sense, of, movement, everything, in, the, structure, seems, to, be, moving, and, flowing, hadid, took, inspiration, from, the, surrounding, orthogonal, site, grids, to, determine, the, overall, form, the, facade, belongs, to, her, earlier, period, with, smooth, curving, white, walls, and, an, austere, black, and, white, colour, scheme, the, building, is, perched, on, groups, of, five, very, thin, pylons, and, one, gallery, with, a, glass, face, precariously, overhangs, the, plaza, in, front, of, the, museum, creating, shade, rowan, moore, of, the, guardian, of, london, described, its, form, as, bending, oblong, tubes, overlapping, intersecting, and, piling, over, each, other, the, imagery, is, of, flow, and, movement, and, it, resembles, a, demented, piece, of, transport, architecture, inside, black, steel, stairs, and, bridges, their, undersides, glowing, with, white, light, fly, across, a, void, they, take, you, off, to, the, galleries, which, are, themselves, works, of, frozen, motion, the, design, is, intended, to, generate, what, hadid, called, confluence, interference, and, turbulence, in, 2002, hadid, won, an, international, competition, for, her, first, project, in, china, the, guangzhou, opera, house, is, located, in, a, new, business, district, of, the, city, with, a, new, 103, storey, glass, tower, behind, it, it, covers, 70, 000, square, metres, and, was, built, at, cost, of, us, 300, million, the, complex, comprises, an, 1, 800, seat, theatre, a, multipurpose, theatre, entry, hall, and, salon, a, covered, pathway, with, restaurants, and, shops, separates, the, two, main, structures, this, building, like, several, of, her, later, buildings, was, inspired, by, natural, earth, forms, the, architect, herself, referred, to, it, as, the, two, pebbles, it, appears, akin, to, two, giant, smooth, edged, boulders, faced, with, 75, 000, panels, of, polished, granite, and, glass, edwin, heathcote, writing, for, the, financial, times, noted, hadid, s, concentration, on, how, her, design, could, transform, the, urban, landscape, of, guangzhou, as, the, building, rose, as, the, centre, of, the, new, business, area, he, wrote, in, 2011, that, hadid, produced, a, building, that, seems, to, suck, the, surrounding, landscape, into, a, vortex, of, movement, and, swirling, space, appears, both, as, alien, object, in, a, landscape, of, incomprehensible, vastness, and, often, overwhelming, banality, and, as, an, extrusion, of, the, peculiar, nature, of, this, landscape, nicolai, ourousoff, architecture, critic, of, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, stepping, into, the, main, hall, is, like, entering, the, soft, insides, of, an, oyster, the, concave, ceiling, is, pierced, by, thousands, of, little, lights, it, looks, like, you, re, sitting, under, the, dome, of, a, clear, night, sky, ourousoff, noted, that, the, finished, building, had, construction, problems, many, of, the, granite, tiles, on, the, exterior, had, to, be, replaced, and, the, plaster, and, other, interior, work, was, poorly, done, by, the, inexperienced, workers, but, he, praised, hadid, s, ability, to, convey, a, sense, of, bodies, in, motion, and, called, the, building, a, chinese, gem, that, elevates, its, setting, the, riverside, museum, 2004, 2011, on, the, banks, of, the, river, clyde, glasgow, scotland, houses, the, glasgow, museum, of, transport, hadid, described, the, 10, 000, square, metre, building, with, 7, 000, square, metres, of, gallery, space, as, a, wave, folds, in, movement, and, a, shed, in, the, form, of, a, tunnel, open, at, the, extreme, ends, one, end, toward, the, city, and, the, other, toward, the, clyde, like, many, of, her, buildings, the, whole, form, is, only, perceived, when, viewed, from, above, the, facades, are, covered, with, zinc, plates, and, the, roofline, has, a, series, of, peaks, and, angles, the, interior, galleries, caused, some, controversy, visitors, who, came, to, see, the, collection, of, historic, automobiles, found, that, they, are, mounted, on, the, walls, high, overhead, so, it, is, impossible, to, look, into, them, rowan, moore, of, the, guardian, of, london, wrote, obviously, the, space, is, about, movement, outside, it, is, typologically, a, supermarket, being, a, big, thing, in, a, parking, lot, that, is, seeking, to, attract, you, in, it, has, enigma, and, majesty, but, not, friendliness, hadid, s, first, built, tower, the, cma, cgm, headquarters, in, marseille, france, is, most, immediately, notable, for, its, dual, vertical, form, according, to, zaha, hadid, architects, the, curving, profiles, on, the, exterior, facades, work, with, the, central, core, of, the, building, bringing, a, rigid, frame, and, a, sense, of, movement, to, this, completely, new, typology, of, tower, the, 94, 000, square, metre, building, which, resembles, a, ship, s, prow, is, the, highest, in, the, town, at, 147, m, and, has, a, capacity, of, 2700, desks, an, 800, seat, company, restaurant, a, 190, seat, auditorium, a, maritime, museum, a, fitness, room, and, training, rooms, hadid, described, her, aquatics, centre, for, the, 2012, summer, olympics, in, london, as, inspired, by, the, fluid, geometry, of, water, in, movement, the, building, covers, three, swimming, pools, and, seats, 17, 500, spectators, at, the, two, main, pools, the, roof, made, of, steel, and, aluminium, and, covered, with, wood, on, the, inside, rests, on, just, three, supports, it, is, in, the, form, of, a, parabolic, arch, that, dips, in, the, centre, with, the, two, pools, at, either, end, the, seats, are, placed, in, bays, beside, the, curving, and, outward, leaning, walls, of, glass, at, 269, million, the, complex, cost, three, times, the, original, estimate, owing, principally, to, the, complexity, of, the, roof, this, was, the, subject, of, much, comment, when, it, was, constructed, and, it, was, the, first, 2012, olympic, building, begun, but, the, last, to, be, finished, it, was, praised, by, architecture, critics, rowan, moore, of, the, guardian, said, that, the, roof, floats, and, undulates, and, called, the, centre, the, olympics, most, majestic, space, the, broad, art, museum, at, michigan, state, university, in, east, lansing, michigan, hadid, s, second, project, in, the, united, states, has, a, space, of, 4, 274, square, metres, dedicated, to, contemporary, art, and, modern, art, and, an, historical, collection, the, parallelogram, shaped, building, leans, sharply, and, seems, about, to, tip, over, hadid, wrote, that, she, designed, the, building, so, that, its, sloping, pleated, stainless, steel, facades, would, reflect, the, surrounding, neighbourhood, from, different, angles, the, building, continually, changes, colour, depending, upon, the, weather, the, time, of, day, and, the, angle, of, the, sun,
