hermann, klaus, hugo, weyl, formemrs, german, 9, november, 1885, 8, december, 1955, was, a, german, mathematician, theoretical, physicist, logician, and, philosopher, although, much, of, his, working, life, was, spent, in, z, rich, switzerland, and, then, princeton, new, jersey, he, is, associated, with, the, university, of, g, ttingen, tradition, of, mathematics, represented, by, carl, friedrich, gauss, david, hilbert, and, hermann, minkowski, his, research, has, had, major, significance, for, theoretical, physics, as, well, as, purely, mathematical, disciplines, such, as, number, theory, he, was, one, of, the, most, influential, mathematicians, of, the, twentieth, century, and, an, important, member, of, the, institute, for, advanced, study, during, its, early, years, weyl, contributed, to, an, exceptionally, wide, range, of, fields, including, works, on, space, time, matter, philosophy, logic, symmetry, and, the, history, of, mathematics, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, conceive, of, combining, general, relativity, with, the, laws, of, electromagnetism, freeman, dyson, wrote, that, weyl, alone, bore, comparison, with, the, last, great, universal, mathematicians, of, the, nineteenth, century, poincar, and, hilbert, michael, atiyah, in, particular, has, commented, that, whenever, he, examined, a, mathematical, topic, he, found, that, weyl, had, preceded, him, hermann, weyl, was, born, in, elmshorn, a, small, town, near, hamburg, in, germany, and, attended, the, gymnasium, christianeum, in, altona, his, father, ludwig, weyl, was, a, banker, whereas, his, mother, anna, weyl, n, e, dieck, came, from, a, wealthy, family, from, 1904, to, 1908, he, studied, mathematics, and, physics, in, both, g, ttingen, and, munich, his, doctorate, was, awarded, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, under, the, supervision, of, david, hilbert, whom, he, greatly, admired, in, september, 1913, in, g, ttingen, weyl, married, friederike, bertha, helene, joseph, march, 30, 1893, september, 5, 1948, who, went, by, the, name, helene, nickname, hella, helene, was, a, daughter, of, dr, bruno, joseph, december, 13, 1861, june, 10, 1934, a, physician, who, held, the, position, of, sanit, tsrat, in, ribnitz, damgarten, germany, helene, was, a, philosopher, she, was, a, disciple, of, phenomenologist, edmund, husserl, and, a, translator, of, spanish, literature, into, german, and, english, especially, the, works, of, spanish, philosopher, jos, ortega, y, gasset, it, was, through, helene, s, close, connection, with, husserl, that, hermann, became, familiar, with, and, greatly, influenced, by, husserl, s, thought, hermann, and, helene, had, two, sons, fritz, joachim, weyl, february, 19, 1915, july, 20, 1977, and, michael, weyl, september, 15, 1917, march, 19, 2011, both, of, whom, were, born, in, z, rich, switzerland, helene, died, in, princeton, new, jersey, on, september, 5, 1948, a, memorial, service, in, her, honor, was, held, in, princeton, on, september, 9, 1948, speakers, at, her, memorial, service, included, her, son, fritz, joachim, weyl, and, mathematicians, oswald, veblen, and, richard, courant, in, 1950, hermann, married, sculptor, ellen, b, r, n, e, lohnstein, april, 17, 1902, july, 14, 1988, who, was, the, widow, of, professor, richard, josef, b, r, september, 11, 1892, december, 15, 1940, of, z, rich, after, taking, a, teaching, post, for, a, few, years, weyl, left, g, ttingen, in, 1913, for, z, rich, to, take, the, chair, of, mathematics, at, the, eth, z, rich, where, he, was, a, colleague, of, albert, einstein, who, was, working, out, the, details, of, the, theory, of, general, relativity, einstein, had, a, lasting, influence, on, weyl, who, became, fascinated, by, mathematical, physics, in, 1921, weyl, met, erwin, schr, dinger, a, theoretical, physicist, who, at, the, time, was, a, professor, at, the, university, of, z, rich, they, were, to, become, close, friends, over, time, weyl, had, some, sort, of, childless, love, affair, with, schr, dinger, s, wife, annemarie, anny, schr, dinger, n, e, bertel, while, at, the, same, time, anny, was, helping, raise, an, illegitimate, daughter, of, erwin, s, named, ruth, georgie, erica, march, who, was, born, in, 1934, in, oxford, england, weyl, was, a, plenary, speaker, of, the, international, congress, of, mathematicians, icm, in, 1928, at, bologna, and, an, invited, speaker, of, the, icm, in, 1936, at, oslo, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, physical, society, in, 1928, a, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1929, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1935, and, a, member, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1940, for, the, academic, year, 1928, 1929, he, was, a, visiting, professor, at, princeton, university, where, he, wrote, a, paper, on, a, problem, in, the, theory, of, groups, arising, in, the, foundations, of, infinitesimal, geometry, with, howard, p, robertson, weyl, left, z, rich, in, 1930, to, become, hilbert, s, successor, at, g, ttingen, leaving, when, the, nazis, assumed, power, in, 1933, particularly, as, his, wife, was, jewish, he, had, been, offered, one, of, the, first, faculty, positions, at, the, new, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, but, had, declined, because, he, did, not, desire, to, leave, his, homeland, as, the, political, situation, in, germany, grew, worse, he, changed, his, mind, and, accepted, when, offered, the, position, again, he, remained, there, until, his, retirement, in, 1951, together, with, his, second, wife, ellen, he, spent, his, time, in, princeton, and, z, rich, and, died, from, a, heart, attack, on, december, 8, 1955, while, living, in, z, rich, weyl, was, cremated, in, z, rich, on, december, 12, 1955, his, ashes, remained, in, private, hands, until, 1999, at, which, time, they, were, interred, in, an, outdoor, columbarium, vault, in, the, princeton, cemetery, the, remains, of, hermann, s, son, michael, weyl, 1917, 2011, are, interred, right, next, to, hermann, s, ashes, in, the, same, columbarium, vault, weyl, was, a, pantheist, in, 1911, weyl, published, ber, die, asymptotische, verteilung, der, eigenwerte, on, the, asymptotic, distribution, of, eigenvalues, in, which, he, proved, that, the, eigenvalues, of, the, laplacian, in, the, compact, domain, are, distributed, according, to, the, so, called, weyl, law, in, 1912, he, suggested, a, new, proof, based, on, variational, principles, weyl, returned, to, this, topic, several, times, considered, elasticity, system, and, formulated, the, weyl, conjecture, these, works, started, an, important, domain, asymptotic, distribution, of, eigenvalues, of, modern, analysis, in, 1913, weyl, published, die, idee, der, riemannschen, fl, che, the, concept, of, a, riemann, surface, which, gave, a, unified, treatment, of, riemann, surfaces, in, it, weyl, utilized, point, set, topology, in, order, to, make, riemann, surface, theory, more, rigorous, a, model, followed, in, later, work, on, manifolds, he, absorbed, l, e, j, brouwer, s, early, work, in, topology, for, this, purpose, weyl, as, a, major, figure, in, the, g, ttingen, school, was, fully, apprised, of, einstein, s, work, from, its, early, days, he, tracked, the, development, of, relativity, physics, in, his, raum, zeit, materie, space, time, matter, from, 1918, reaching, a, 4th, edition, in, 1922, in, 1918, he, introduced, the, notion, of, gauge, and, gave, the, first, example, of, what, is, now, known, as, a, gauge, theory, weyl, s, gauge, theory, was, an, unsuccessful, attempt, to, model, the, electromagnetic, field, and, the, gravitational, field, as, geometrical, properties, of, spacetime, the, weyl, tensor, in, riemannian, geometry, is, of, major, importance, in, understanding, the, nature, of, conformal, geometry, his, overall, approach, in, physics, was, based, on, the, phenomenological, philosophy, of, edmund, husserl, specifically, husserl, s, 1913, ideen, zu, einer, reinen, ph, nomenologie, und, ph, nomenologischen, philosophie, erstes, buch, allgemeine, einf, hrung, in, die, reine, ph, nomenologie, ideas, of, a, pure, phenomenology, and, phenomenological, philosophy, first, book, general, introduction, husserl, had, reacted, strongly, to, gottlob, frege, s, criticism, of, his, first, work, on, the, philosophy, of, arithmetic, and, was, investigating, the, sense, of, mathematical, and, other, structures, which, frege, had, distinguished, from, empirical, reference, from, 1923, to, 1938, weyl, developed, the, theory, of, compact, groups, in, terms, of, matrix, representations, in, the, compact, lie, group, case, he, proved, a, fundamental, character, formula, these, results, are, foundational, in, understanding, the, symmetry, structure, of, quantum, mechanics, which, he, put, on, a, group, theoretic, basis, this, included, spinors, together, with, the, mathematical, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, in, large, measure, due, to, john, von, neumann, this, gave, the, treatment, familiar, since, about, 1930, non, compact, groups, and, their, representations, particularly, the, heisenberg, group, were, also, streamlined, in, that, specific, context, in, his, 1927, weyl, quantization, the, best, extant, bridge, between, classical, and, quantum, physics, to, date, from, this, time, and, certainly, much, helped, by, weyl, s, expositions, lie, groups, and, lie, algebras, became, a, mainstream, part, both, of, pure, mathematics, and, theoretical, physics, his, book, the, classical, groups, reconsidered, invariant, theory, it, covered, symmetric, groups, general, linear, groups, orthogonal, groups, and, symplectic, groups, and, results, on, their, invariants, and, representations, weyl, also, showed, how, to, use, exponential, sums, in, diophantine, approximation, with, his, criterion, for, uniform, distribution, mod, 1, which, was, a, fundamental, step, in, analytic, number, theory, this, work, applied, to, the, riemann, zeta, function, as, well, as, additive, number, theory, it, was, developed, by, many, others, in, the, continuum, weyl, developed, the, logic, of, predicative, analysis, using, the, lower, levels, of, bertrand, russell, s, ramified, theory, of, types, he, was, able, to, develop, most, of, classical, calculus, while, using, neither, the, axiom, of, choice, nor, proof, by, contradiction, and, avoiding, georg, cantor, s, infinite, sets, weyl, appealed, in, this, period, to, the, radical, constructivism, of, the, german, romantic, subjective, idealist, fichte, shortly, after, publishing, the, continuum, weyl, briefly, shifted, his, position, wholly, to, the, intuitionism, of, brouwer, in, the, continuum, the, constructible, points, exist, as, discrete, entities, weyl, wanted, a, continuum, that, was, not, an, aggregate, of, points, he, wrote, a, controversial, article, proclaiming, for, himself, and, l, e, j, brouwer, a, revolution, this, article, was, far, more, influential, in, propagating, intuitionistic, views, than, the, original, works, of, brouwer, himself, george, p, lya, and, weyl, during, a, mathematicians, gathering, in, z, rich, 9, february, 1918, made, a, bet, concerning, the, future, direction, of, mathematics, weyl, predicted, that, in, the, subsequent, 20, years, mathematicians, would, come, to, realize, the, total, vagueness, of, notions, such, as, real, numbers, sets, and, countability, and, moreover, that, asking, about, the, truth, or, falsity, of, the, least, upper, bound, property, of, the, real, numbers, was, as, meaningful, as, asking, about, truth, of, the, basic, assertions, of, hegel, on, the, philosophy, of, nature, any, answer, to, such, a, question, would, be, unverifiable, unrelated, to, experience, and, therefore, senseless, however, within, a, few, years, weyl, decided, that, brouwer, s, intuitionism, did, put, too, great, restrictions, on, mathematics, as, critics, had, always, said, the, crisis, article, had, disturbed, weyl, s, formalist, teacher, hilbert, but, later, in, the, 1920s, weyl, partially, reconciled, his, position, with, that, of, hilbert, after, about, 1928, weyl, had, apparently, decided, that, mathematical, intuitionism, was, not, compatible, with, his, enthusiasm, for, the, phenomenological, philosophy, of, husserl, as, he, had, apparently, earlier, thought, in, the, last, decades, of, his, life, weyl, emphasized, mathematics, as, symbolic, construction, and, moved, to, a, position, closer, not, only, to, hilbert, but, to, that, of, ernst, cassirer, weyl, however, rarely, refers, to, cassirer, and, wrote, only, brief, articles, and, passages, articulating, this, position, by, 1949, weyl, was, thoroughly, disillusioned, with, the, ultimate, value, of, intuitionism, and, wrote, mathematics, with, brouwer, gains, its, highest, intuitive, clarity, he, succeeds, in, developing, the, beginnings, of, analysis, in, a, natural, manner, all, the, time, preserving, the, contact, with, intuition, much, more, closely, than, had, been, done, before, it, cannot, be, denied, however, that, in, advancing, to, higher, and, more, general, theories, the, inapplicability, of, the, simple, laws, of, classical, logic, eventually, results, in, an, almost, unbearable, awkwardness, and, the, mathematician, watches, with, pain, the, greater, part, of, his, towering, edifice, which, he, believed, to, be, built, of, concrete, blocks, dissolve, into, mist, before, his, eyes, as, john, l, bell, puts, it, it, seems, to, me, a, great, pity, that, weyl, did, not, live, to, see, the, emergence, in, the, 1970s, of, smooth, infinitesimal, analysis, a, mathematical, framework, within, which, his, vision, of, a, true, continuum, not, synthesized, from, discrete, elements, is, realized, although, the, underlying, logic, of, smooth, infinitesimal, analysis, is, intuitionistic, the, law, of, excluded, middle, not, being, generally, affirmable, mathematics, developed, within, avoids, the, unbearable, awkwardness, to, which, weyl, refers, above, in, 1929, weyl, proposed, an, equation, known, as, the, weyl, equation, for, use, in, a, replacement, to, the, dirac, equation, this, equation, describes, massless, fermions, a, normal, dirac, fermion, could, be, split, into, two, weyl, fermions, or, formed, from, two, weyl, fermions, neutrinos, were, once, thought, to, be, weyl, fermions, but, they, are, now, known, to, have, mass, weyl, fermions, are, sought, after, for, electronics, applications, quasiparticles, that, behave, as, weyl, fermions, were, discovered, in, 2015, in, a, form, of, crystals, known, as, weyl, semimetals, a, type, of, topological, material, weyl, had, been, interested, in, philosophy, since, his, youth, when, he, read, immanuel, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, with, space, and, time, as, a, priori, concepts, of, knowledge, even, if, he, later, disliked, kant, s, too, close, ties, to, euclidean, geometry, from, 1912, onwards, he, was, strongly, influenced, by, edmund, husserl, and, his, phenomenology, which, was, also, reflected, in, some, passages, in, his, book, space, time, matter, in, 1927, his, contribution, philosophy, of, mathematics, and, natural, sciences, to, the, handbook, of, philosophy, was, published, by, oldenbourg, verlag, which, was, later, published, separately, and, revised, as, a, book, in, an, attempt, to, reconstruct, the, origins, of, hermann, weyl, s, philosophy, and, to, integrate, them, into, the, main, currents, of, philosophy, norman, sieroka, pointed, to, intensive, long, term, discussions, between, weyl, and, his, zurich, philosopher, colleague, fritz, medicus, a, specialist, on, johann, gottlieb, fichte, fichte, s, wissenschaftslehre, and, philosophy, according, to, which, being, results, from, the, interaction, of, the, absolute, ego, with, its, material, neighbourhood, umgebung, is, also, of, great, influence, on, weyl, and, is, reflected, in, weyl, s, use, of, the, neighbourhood, concept, of, topology, continuum, and, in, weyl, s, conception, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, alongside, the, influences, of, edmund, husserl, s, phenomenology, known, directly, from, weyl, s, writings, according, to, sieroka, weyl, also, finds, influences, from, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, s, theory, of, matter, the, theory, of, monads, etc, and, german, idealism, fichte, s, dialectic, in, weyl, s, philosophical, interpretation, of, the, physical, concept, of, matter, in, the, context, of, quantum, theory, and, general, relativity, and, with, regard, to, interaction, of, a, symbol, with, its, surroundings, in, a, mathematical, theory, structure, also, in, weyl, s, philosophy, of, mathematics, debate, between, formalism, and, intuitionism, under, the, influence, of, brouwer, he, understands, the, intra, mathematical, debate, about, intuitionism, and, formalism, along, the, lines, of, a, debate, between, husserlian, phenomenology, and, fichtean, constructivism, in, the, 1920s, before, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, and, inspired, by, the, statistical, nature, of, quantum, theory, which, was, becoming, increasingly, clear, at, the, time, weyl, turned, away, from, the, field, theoretical, description, of, matter, towards, a, theory, of, active, agens, matter, which, was, achieved, by, including, the, spatial, environment, in, the, field, theoretical, description, expressed, he, had, previously, described, the, general, theory, of, relativity, and, his, own, extensions, of, it, which, led, to, the, origin, of, today, s, concept, of, gauge, field, theories, using, differential, geometric, methods, under, the, influence, of, quantum, theory, he, turned, away, from, this, geometric, field, theory, according, to, sieroka, fichte, and, ernst, cassirer, were, also, an, important, influence, in, weyl, s, late, philosophy, science, as, a, symbolic, construction, weyl, s, involvement, with, martin, heidegger, was, less, well, known, although, weyl, did, not, agree, with, heidegger, s, opinion, about, death, his, conception, of, neighbourhood, umgebung, was, influenced, by, heidegger, s, existentialism
