endowed, with, a, name, which, seemed, to, be, intended, to, inspire, terror, having, been, appointed, governor, of, the, roman, province, of, gallia, narbonensis, modern, provence, in, 58, bc, julius, caesar, proceeded, to, conquer, the, gallic, tribes, beyond, over, the, next, few, years, maintaining, control, through, a, careful, divide, and, rule, strategy, he, made, use, of, the, factionalism, among, the, gallic, elites, favouring, certain, noblemen, over, others, with, political, support, and, roman, luxuries, such, as, wine, attempts, at, revolt, such, as, that, of, ambiorix, in, 54, bc, had, secured, only, local, support, but, vercingetorix, whose, father, celtillus, had, been, put, to, death, by, his, own, countrymen, for, seeking, to, rule, all, of, gaul, managed, to, unify, the, gallic, tribes, against, the, romans, and, adopted, more, current, styles, of, warfare, the, revolt, that, vercingetorix, came, to, lead, began, in, early, 52, bc, while, caesar, was, raising, troops, in, cisalpine, gaul, believing, that, caesar, would, be, distracted, by, the, turmoil, in, rome, following, the, death, of, publius, clodius, pulcher, the, carnutes, under, cotuatus, and, conetodunus, made, the, first, move, slaughtering, the, romans, who, had, settled, in, their, territory, vercingetorix, a, young, nobleman, of, the, arvernian, city, of, gergovia, roused, his, dependents, to, join, the, revolt, but, he, and, his, followers, were, expelled, by, vercingetorix, s, uncle, gobanitio, and, the, rest, of, the, nobles, because, they, thought, that, opposing, caesar, was, too, great, a, risk, undeterred, vercingetorix, raised, an, army, of, the, poor, took, gergovia, and, was, hailed, as, king, he, made, alliances, with, other, tribes, and, in, doing, so, he, united, gaul, under, the, pretense, of, escaping, roman, rule, after, having, been, unanimously, given, supreme, command, of, their, armies, he, imposed, his, authority, through, harsh, discipline, and, the, taking, of, hostages, leadership, and, unification, on, this, level, was, unprecedented, in, gaul, and, would, not, happen, again, for, decades, he, adopted, a, policy, of, retreating, to, natural, fortifications, and, undertook, an, early, example, of, a, scorched, earth, strategy, by, burning, towns, to, prevent, the, roman, legions, from, living, off, the, land, vercingetorix, scorched, much, of, the, land, marching, north, with, his, army, from, gergovia, in, an, attempt, to, deprive, caesar, of, the, resources, and, safe, haven, of, the, towns, and, villages, along, caesar, s, march, south, however, the, capital, of, the, bituriges, avaricum, near, modern, day, bourges, a, gallic, settlement, directly, in, caesar, s, path, was, spared, due, to, the, town, s, strong, protests, naturally, defensible, terrain, and, apparently, strong, man, made, reinforcing, defenses, vercingetorix, decided, against, razing, and, burning, it, leaving, the, town, to, its, fate, vercingetorix, camped, well, outside, of, avaricum, and, focused, on, conducting, harassing, engagements, of, the, advancing, roman, units, led, by, caesar, and, his, chief, lieutenant, titus, labienus, upon, reaching, avaricum, however, the, romans, laid, siege, and, eventually, captured, the, capital, afterwards, in, a, reprisal, for, 25, days, of, hunger, and, of, laboring, over, the, siegeworks, required, to, breach, avaricum, s, defenses, the, romans, slaughtered, nearly, the, entire, population, some, 40, 000, people, leaving, only, about, 800, alive, the,

vercingetorix, then, decided, to, follow, caesar, but, suffered, heavy, losses, as, did, the, romans, and, their, allies, during, a, cavalry, battle, and, he, retreated, and, moved, to, another,

off, from, them, on, the, inside, and, without, his, guidance, the, attacks, were, initially, unsuccessful, however, the, attacks, did, reveal, a, weak, point, in, the, fortifications, and, the, combined, forces, on, the, inside, and, the, outside, almost, made, a, breakthrough, only, when, caesar, personally, led, the, last, reserves, into, battle, did, he, finally, manage, to, prevail,
