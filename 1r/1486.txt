expected, to, be, named, as, a, member, of, prime, minister, james, scullin, s, cabinet, but, disapproval, of, his, heavy, drinking, habit, meant, that, he, remained, on, the, backbench, william,

by, just, one, vote, to, become, leader, of, the, labor, party, and, leader, of, the, opposition, the, groups, that, had, supported, curtin, did, so, on, the, basis, that, he, promise, to, give, up,

frederick, lee, appeared, to, have, won, the, seat, on, the, second, count, after, most, of, independent, guildford, clarke, s, preferences, flowed, to, him, and, it, was, not, until, the, final,

the, leader, of, the, country, party, as, menzies, replacement, even, though, the, uap, was, the, senior, partner, in, the, coalition, curtin, adroitly, refused, calls, from, his, own, caucus, to, bring, about, the, defeat, of, the, government, through, a, motion, of, no, confidence, curtin, had, refused, menzies, initial, offer, to, form, a, wartime, national, government, partly, because, he, feared, that, it, would, split, the, labor, party, although, he, did, agree, to, join, the, advisory, war, council, in, october, 1941, arthur, coles, and, alexander, wilson, the, two, independent, mps, who, had, been, keeping, the, coalition, in, office, since, 1940, first, under, menzies, then, under, fadden, joined, forces, with, labor, in, defeating, fadden, s, budget, and, bringing, the, government, down, governor, general, lord, gowrie, was, reluctant, to, call, an, election, for, a, parliament, barely, a, year, old, especially, given, the, international, situation, he, summoned, coles, and, wilson, and, made, them, promise, that, if, he, named, curtin, prime, minister, they, would, support, him, for, the, remainder, of, the, parliament, to, end, the, instability, in, government, the, independents, agreed, and, curtin, was, sworn, in, as, prime, minister, on, 7, october, aged, 56, he, became, the, first, and, only, prime, minister, to, come, from, western, australia, on, 8, december, 1941, the, pacific, war, broke, out, when, japan, bombed, pearl, harbor, curtin, addressed, the, nation, on, the, radio, saying, men, and, women, of, australia, we, are, at, war, with, japan, this, is, the, gravest, hour, of, our, history, we, australians, have, imperishable, traditions, we, shall, maintain, them, we, shall, vindicate, them, we, shall, hold, this, country, and, keep, it, as, a, citadel, for, the, british, speaking, race, and, as, a, place, where, civilisation, will, persist, on, 10, december, hms, prince, of, wales, and, hms, repulse, were, both, sunk, by, japanese, bombers, off, the, malayan, coast, curtin, cabled, the, president, of, the, united, states, franklin, d, roosevelt, and, churchill, on, 23, december, saying, the, fall, of, singapore, would, mean, the, isolation, of, the, philippines, the, fall, of, the, netherlands, east, indies, and, attempts, to, smother, all, other, bases, it, is, in, your, power, to, meet, the, situation, we, would, gladly, accept, united, states, commanders, in, the, pacific, area, please, consider, this, as, a, matter, of, urgency, curtin, made, crucial, decisions, linking, australia, to, the, united, states, on, 28, december, the, sydney, daily, telegraph, published, a, public, statement, of, his, government, s, new, attitude, we, look, for, a, solid, and, impregnable, barrier, of, the, democracies, against, the, three, axis, powers, and, we, refuse, to, accept, the, dictum, that, the, pacific, struggle, must, be, treated, as, a, subordinate, segment, of, the, general, conflict, by, that, it, is, not, meant, that, any, one, of, the, other, theatres, of, war, is, of, less, importance, than, the, pacific, but, that, australia, asks, for, a, concerted, plan, evoking, the, greatest, strength, at, the, democracies, disposal, determined, upon, hurling, japan, back, the, australian, government, therefore, regards, the, pacific, struggle, as, primarily, one, in, which, the, united, states, and, australia, must, have, the, fullest, say, in, the, direction, of, the, democracies, fighting, plan, without, any, inhibitions, of, any, kind, i, make, it, clear, that, australia, looks, to, america, free, of, any, pangs, as, to, our, traditional, links, or, kinship, with, the, united, kingdom, we, know, the, problems, that, the, united, kingdom, faces, we, know, the, dangers, of, dispersal, of, strength, but, we, know, too, that, australia, can, go, and, britain, can, still, hold, on, we, are, therefore, determined, that, australia, shall, not, go, and, we, shall, exert, all, our, energies, towards, the, shaping, of, a, plan, with, the, united, states, as, its, keystone, which, will, give, to, our, country, some, confidence, of, being, able, to, hold, out, until, the, tide, of, battle, swings, against, the, enemy, this, speech, was, one, of, the, most, important, in, australia, s, history, marking, a, turning, point, in, australia, s, relationship, with, its, founding, country, the, united, kingdom, many, felt, that, prime, minister, curtin, was, abandoning, australia, s, traditional, ties, to, the, british, isles, without, any, solid, partnership, in, place, with, the, united, states, this, speech, also, received, criticism, at, high, levels, of, government, in, australia, britain, and, the, us, it, angered, churchill, and, roosevelt, said, that, it, smacked, of, panic, the, speech, nevertheless, achieved, the, effect, of, drawing, attention, to, the, possibility, that, australia, would, be, invaded, by, japan, before, this, speech, the, australian, response, to, the, war, effort, had, been, troubled, by, attitudes, swinging, from, she, ll, be, right, to, gossip, driven, panic, by, 1943, when, the, threat, of, japanese, invasion, had, passed, curtin, increasingly, returned, to, a, commitment, to, the, british, empire, downplaying, nationalism, he, said, that, australia, comprised, seven, million, britishers, he, saw, the, united, states, as, a, predatory, economic, and, military, power, that, would, threaten, australia, s, own, ambitions, in, the, pacific, australia, moved, closer, to, new, zealand, and, suggested, a, lesser, role, for, the, united, states, after, the, war, washington, was, annoyed, concurrently, the, curtin, government, enacted, the, statute, of, westminster, adoption, act, 1942, under, which, australia, accepted, the, dominion, status, which, britain, had, conferred, in, 1930, but, which, the, australian, federal, government, had, not, accepted, until, then, the, adoption, act, took, effect, retroactively, as, of, 3, september, 1939, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, although, politically, a, product, of, the, government, s, policy, of, re, orientation, towards, the, united, states, constitutionally, this, marked, the, moment, that, australia, became, an, independent, nation, with, a, separate, crown, no, longer, subject, to, the, supremacy, of, british, law, and, the, british, crown, the, curtin, government, agreed, that, the, australian, army, s, i, corps, centred, on, the, 6th, and, 7th, divisions, would, be, transferred, from, north, africa, to, the, american, british, dutch, australian, command, in, the, netherlands, east, indies, for, the, defence, of, java, and, sumatra, before, they, could, arrive, singapore, fell, on, 15, february, 1942, most, of, the, 8th, division, was, taken, into, captivity, although, a, small, number, including, its, commander, major, general, gordon, bennett, managed, to, escape, the, fall, of, singapore, curtin, announced, in, a, radio, address, to, the, nation, on, 16, february, can, only, be, described, as, australia, s, dunkirk, it, will, be, recalled, that, the, fall, of, dunkirk, initiated, the, battle, for, britain, the, fall, of, singapore, opens, the, battle, for, australia, on, its, issue, depends, not, merely, the, fate, of, this, commonwealth, but, the, frontier, of, the, united, states, of, america, and, indeed, all, the, americas, and, therefore, in, a, large, measure, the, fate, of, the, british, speaking, world, the, japanese, threat, was, further, underlined, on, 19, february, when, japan, bombed, darwin, the, first, of, many, air, raids, on, northern, australia, churchill, attempted, to, divert, i, corps, to, reinforce, british, troops, in, burma, without, australian, approval, curtin, insisted, that, it, return, to, australia, roosevelt, supported, churchill, offering, to, send, an, american, division, to, australia, instead, while, the, chief, of, the, australian, general, staff, lieutenant, general, vernon, sturdee, threatened, to, resign, if, his, advice, was, ignored, and, the, troops, were, diverted, to, burma, curtin, prevailed, although, he, agreed, that, the, main, body, of, the, 6th, division, could, garrison, ceylon, in, the, 1943, australian, federal, election, campaign, the, following, year, curtin, was, forced, to, publicly, defend, his, decision, had, we, held, rangoon, or, had, we, even, held, the, district, of, akyab, media, magnate, keith, murdoch, wrote, in, an, editorial, on, 13, august, 1943, we, would, have, held, the, door, to, the, vast, manpower, of, china, and, the, jumping, off, fields, for, the, devastation, of, japanese, cities, multitudes, of, the, finest, lives, of, australia, britain, and, america, would, have, been, saved, the, long, years, of, toil, death, and, separation, which, assuredly, stretch, ahead, would, have, been, shortened, curtin, formed, a, close, working, relationship, with, the, allied, supreme, commander, in, the, south, west, pacific, area, general, douglas, macarthur, curtin, realised, that, australia, would, be, ignored, unless, it, had, a, strong, voice, in, washington, d, c, and, he, wanted, that, voice, to, be, macarthur, s, he, gave, over, control, of, australian, forces, to, macarthur, directing, australian, commanders, to, treat, macarthur, s, orders, as, if, they, came, from, the, australian, government, biographer, john, edwards, wrote, a, lesser, australian, leader, might, have, grated, against, macarthur, s, vanity, cavilled, at, his, assumption, of, command, contradicted, his, grandiloquent, claims, satirised, his, manner, curtin, did, not, he, seized, the, chance, to, share, authority, with, macarthur, refused, to, offend, his, vanity, drew, him, as, close, as, he, could, of, curtin, s, military, decisions, it, was, the, cleverest, most, fruitful, most, abidingly, successful, by, mid, 1942, the, results, of, the, battles, of, the, coral, sea, and, midway, had, averted, the, perceived, threat, of, invasion, despite, the, beat, germany, first, policy, 346, 000, americans, were, fighting, in, the, pacific, in, 1942, curtin, had, previously, opposed, conscription, for, overseas, service, during, world, war, i, and, again, in, 1940, when, it, was, introduced, by, menzies, although, he, had, supported, softening, it, to, allow, conscripts, to, serve, in, australian, territories, curtin, recognised, that, the, restriction, of, the, australian, conscripts, to, australia, and, its, territories, was, morally, indefensible, and, politically, unviable, to, remove, what, was, now, a, major, obstacle, to, the, government, s, re, election, prospects, he, moved, to, remove, the, restriction, while, there, was, support, from, the, communist, party, of, australia, and, its, sympathisers, there, was, trenchant, opposition, from, the, catholic, church, represented, by, b, a, santamaria, and, arthur, calwell, ultimately, the, defence, act, was, amended, so, that, conscripts, could, be, deployed, outside, of, australia, to, such, other, territories, in, the, south, west, pacific, area, as, the, governor, general, proclaims, as, being, territories, associated,
