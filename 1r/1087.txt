mahmud, born, 1087, whom, she, wanted, to, succeed, his, father, while, nizam, and, most, of, the, seljuk, army, was, in, favor, of, barkiyaruq, the, oldest, of, all, malik, shah, s, living, sons, and, born, to, a, seljuk, princess, terken, khatun, then, allied, with, taj, al, mulk, abu, l, ghana, im, to, try, to, remove, nizam, from, his, post, taj, even, accused, nizam, of, corruption, before, the, sultan, malik, shah, i, however, did, not, dare, to, dismiss, nizam, nizam, later, besieged, alamut, but, was, forced, to, withdraw, in, 1092, nizam, just, before, his, death, knowing, that, his, enemies, were, planning, plots, against, him, made, a, famous, speech, at, the, court, tell, the, sultan, if, you, have, not, already, realized, that, i, am, your, co, equal, in, the, work, of, ruling, then, know, that, you, have, only, attained, to, this, power, through, my, statesmanship, and, judgement, does, he, not, remember, when, his, father, was, killed, and, i, assumed, responsibility, for, the, conduct, of, affairs, and, crushed, the, rebels, who, reared, their, heads, from, his, own, family, and, from, elsewhere, tell, him, that, the, stability, of, that, regal, cap, is, bound, up, with, this, vizierial, inkstand, and, that, the, harmony, of, these, two, interests, is, the, means, of, securing, all, objects, soughts, after, and, the, ultimate, cause, of, all, objects, gained, if, ever, i, close, up, this, inkstand, that, royal, power, will, topple, aside, from, his, extraordinary, influence, as, vizier, with, full, authority, he, is, also, well, known, for, systematically, founding, a, number, of, schools, of, higher, education, in, several, cities, like, baghdad, isfahan, amol, nishapur, mosul, basra, and, herat, the, famous, nizamiyyah, schools, which, were, named, after, him, nizam, al, mulk, is, also, widely, known, for, his, voluminous, treatise, on, kingship, titled, siyasatnama, book, of, government, which, was, written, after, malik, shah, had, requested, that, his, ministers, produce, books, on, government, administration, and, the, troubles, facing, the, nation, however, the, treatise, made, by, nizam, was, the, only, one, to, receive, approval, and, was, consequently, accepted, as, forming, the, law, of, the, constitution, of, the, nation, the, treatise, uses, historical, examples, to, discuss, justice, effective, rule, and, the, role, of, government, in, islamic, society, and, has, been, compared, to, machiavelli, s, the, prince, the, work, also, discusses, various, aspects, of, state, surveillance, and, spying, advising, rulers, to, establish, an, extensive, espionage, network, he, also, wrote, a, book, titled, dastur, al, wuzar, written, for, his, son, abu, l, fath, fakhr, al, malik, which, is, not, dissimilar, to, the, famous, book, of, qabus, nama, nizam, al, mulk, was, assassinated, en, route, from, isfahan, to, baghdad, on, 10, ramadan, 485, a, h, 14, october, 1092, the, mainstream, literature, says, he, was, stabbed, by, the, dagger, of, a, member, of, the, assassins, sent, by, the, notorious, hassan, i, sabbah, near, nahavand, as, he, was, being, carried, on, his, litter, the, killer, approached, him, disguised, as, a, sufi, this, account, is, particularly, interesting, in, light, of, a, possibly, apocryphal, story, that, first, appeared, in, english, in, the, introduction, to, edward, fitzgerald, s, translation, of, the, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, in, this, story, a, pact, is, formed, between, a, young, nizam, al, mulk, at, that, time, known, as, abdul, khassem, and, his, two, friends, omar, khayyam, and, hassan, i, sabbah, their, agreement, stated, that, if, one, should, rise, to, prominence, that, they, would, help, the, other, two, to, do, likewise, nizam, al, mulk, was, the, first, to, do, this, when, he, was, appointed, vizier, to, the, sultan, alp, arslan, to, fulfill, the, pact, he, offered, both, friends, positions, of, rank, within, the, court, omar, refused, the, offer, asking, instead, to, be, given, the, means, to, continue, his, studies, indefinitely, this, nizam, did, as, well, as, building, him, an, observatory, although, hassan, unlike, omar, decided, to, accept, the, appointment, offered, to, him, he, was, forced, to, flee, after, plotting, to, depose, nizam, as, vizier, subsequently, hassan, came, upon, and, conquered, the, fortress, of, alamut, from, where, he, established, the, assassins, according, to, bernard, lewis, this, tale, is, unlikely, to, be, true, because, hassan, i, sabbah, died, in, 1124, and, omar, khayyam, in, 1123, at, the, earliest, since, nizam, al, mulk, was, born, in, 1020, at, the, latest, the, three, were, not, of, similar, ages, and, were, probably, not, students, together, nizam, al, mulk, was, a, skilled, and, effective, vizier, he, represented, the, majesty, splendor, and, hospitality, of, the, barmakids, historians, and, poets, describe, him, as, a, great, organizer, and, an, ideal, soldier, and, scholar, because, of, his, talents, it, was, possible, for, the, seljuk, turks, to, establish, a, powerful, empire, in, their, new, home, nizam, was, not, only, the, leader, of, the, persian, dominated, bureaucratic, divan, but, was, also, an, atabeg, who, served, in, the, royal, court, dadgar, and, played, an, important, role, between, the, politically, and, culturally, different, iranians, and, turks, he, was, also, responsible, for, establishing, distinctly, persian, forms, of, government, and, administration, which, would, last, for, centuries, because, of, his, excellent, tutorship, and, close, friendship, with, malik, shah, he, was, usually, called, father, by, him, he, was, even, greatly, respected, by, his, ghulams, who, after, the, death, of, nizam, took, revenge, on, several, of, his, rivals, such, as, taj, al, mulk, abu, l, ghana, im, even, after, his, death, his, family, continued, to, play, an, important, role, in, the, seljuk, empire, he, was, married, to, a, niece, or, daughter, of, bagrat, iv, of, georgia, who, had, previously, been, married, or, betrothed, to, alp, arslan, all, of, his, twelve, sons, held, important, offices, in,
