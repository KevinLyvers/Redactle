structures, like, all, of, johnson, s, early, work, it, was, inspired, by, mies, but, its, pure, symmetry, dark, colors, and, closeness, to, the, earth, marked, it, as, a, personal, statement, calm, and, ordered, rather, than, sleek, and, brittle, johnson, continued, to, add, to, the, glass, house, estate, during, each, period, of, his, career, he, added, a, small, pavilion, with, columns, by,
