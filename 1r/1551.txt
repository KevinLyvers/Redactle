march, 1911, as, the, struggle, to, oust, d, az, was, ongoing, although, madero, had, created, a, broad, movement, against, d, az, he, was, not, sufficiently, radical, for, anarcho, syndicalists, of, the, mexican, liberal, party, who, challenged, his, leadership, madero, ordered, villa, to, deal, with, the, threat, which, he, did, disarming, and, arresting, them, madero, rewarded, villa, by, promoting, him, to, colonel, in, the, revolutionary, forces, much, of, the, fighting, was, in, the, north, of, mexico, near, the, border, with, the, united, states, fearful, of, u, s, intervention, madero, ordered, his, officers, to, call, off, the, siege, of, the, strategic, border, city, of, ciudad, ju, rez, villa, and, pascual, orozco, attacked, instead, capturing, the, city, after, two, days, of, fighting, thus, winning, the, first, battle, of, ciudad, ju, rez, in, 1911, facing, a, series, of, defeats, in, many, places, d, az, resigned, on, 25, may, 1911, afterward, going, into,

the, rebel, forces, including, villa, were, demobilized, and, madero, called, on, the, men, of, action, to, return, to, civilian, life, orozco, and, villa, demanded, that, hacienda, land, seized, during, the, violence, bringing, madero, to, power, be, distributed, to, revolutionary, soldiers, madero, refused, saying, that, the, government, would, buy, the, properties, from, their, owners, and, then, distribute, them, to, the, revolutionaries, at, some, future, date, according, to, a, story, recounted, by, villa, he, told, madero, at, a, banquet, in, ciudad, ju, rez, after, the, victory, in, 1911, you, sir, have, destroyed, the, revolution, it, s, simple, this, bunch, of, dandies, have, made, a, fool, of, you, and, this, will, eventually, cost, us, our, necks, yours, included, this,

in, november, 1911, madero, proved, a, disastrous, politician, dismissing, his, revolutionary, supporters, and, relying, on, the, existing, power, structure, villa, strongly, disapproved, of, madero, s, decision, to, name, venustiano, carranza, who, previously, had, been, a, staunch, supporter, of, diaz, until, diaz, refused, to, appoint, him, as, governor, of, coahuila, in, 1909, as, his, minister, of, war, madero, s, refusal, personally, to, accommodate, orozco, was, a, major, political, blunder, orozco, rebelled, in, march, 1912, both, for, madero, s, continuing, failure, to, enact, land, reform, and, because, he, felt, insufficiently, rewarded, for, his, role, in, bringing, the, new, president, to, power, at, the, request, of, madero, s, chief, political, ally, in, the, state, chihuahua, governor, abraham, gonz, lez, villa, returned, to, military, service, under, madero, to, fight, the, rebellion, led, by, his, former, comrade, orozco, although, orozco, appealed, with, him, to, join, his, rebellion, villa, again, gave, madero, key, military, victories, with, 400, cavalrymen, he, captured, parral, from, the, orozquistas, and, then, joined, forces, in, the, strategic, city, of, torre, n, with, the, federal, army, under, the, command, of, general, victoriano, huerta, huerta, initially, welcomed, the, successful, villa, and, sought, to, bring, him, under, his, control, by, naming, villa, an, honorary, brigadier, general, in, the, federal, army, but, villa, was, not, flattered, or, controlled, easily, huerta, then, sought, to, discredit, and, eliminate, villa, by, accusing, him, of, stealing, a, fine, horse, and, calling, him, a, bandit, villa, struck, huerta, who, then, ordered, villa, s, execution, for, insubordination, and, theft, as, he, was, about, to, be, executed, by, firing, squad, he, made, appeal, to, generals, emilio, madero, and, raul, madero, brothers, of, president, madero, their, intervention, delayed, the, execution, until,

him, the, butt, of, jokes, and, pranks, carranza, s, political, plan, gained, the, support, of, politicians, and, generals, including, pablo, gonz, lez, lvaro, obreg, n, and, villa, the, movement, collectively, was, called, the, ej, rcito, constitucionalista, de, m, xico, constitutionalist, army, of, mexico, the, constitucionalista, adjective, was, added, to, stress, the, point, that, huerta, legally, had, not, obtained, power, through, lawful, avenues, laid, out, by, mexico, s, constitution, of, 1857, until, huerta, s, ouster, villa, joined, with, the, revolutionary, forces, in, the, north, under, first, chief, carranza, and, his, plan, of, guadalupe, the, period, 1913, 1914, was, the, time, of, villa, s, greatest, international, fame, and, military, and, political, success, through, this, time, villa, focused, on, accessing, funding, from, wealthy, hacendados, and, raised, money, using, methods, such, as, forced, assessments, on, hostile, hacienda, owners, and, train,

brilliant, tactician, on, the, battlefield, which, translated, to, political, support, in, 1913, local, military, commanders, elected, him, provisional, governor, of, the, state, of, chihuahua,

pensions, of, citizens, who, had, lost, family, members, in, the, revolution, villa, also, decreed, that, after, the, completion, of, the, revolution, the, land, would, be, redistributed, away, from, the, hands, of, the, oligarchy, to, revolutionary, veterans, former, owners, of, the, land, from, before, the, hacendados, took, the, land, and, the, state, itself, in, equal, parts, these, motions, accompanied, with, gifts, and, cost, reductions, for, poorer, sections, of, the, state, represented, large, changes, from, previous, revolutionary, governments, and, led, to, large, support, for, villa, in, significant, portions, of, chihuahua, s, population, after, four, weeks, as, the, governor, villa, retired, from, the, position, at, the, suggestion, of, carranza, leaving, manuel, chao, as, governor, with, so, many, sources, of, money, villa, expanded, and, modernized, his, forces, purchasing, draft, animals, cavalry, horses, arms, ammunition, mobile, hospital, facilities, railroad,

he, also, recruited, fighters, from, chihuahua, and, durango, and, created, a, large, army, known, as, the, division, del, norte, division, of, the, north, 287, the, most, powerful, and, feared, military, unit, in, all, of, mexico, the, rebuilt, railroad, transported, villa, s, troops, and, artillery, south, where, he, defeated, the, federal, army, forces, in, a, series, of, battles, at, g, mez, palacio, torre, n, and, eventually, at, the, heart, of, huerta, s, regime, in, zacatecas, after, villa, captured, the, strategic, prize, of, torre, n, carranza, ordered, villa, to, break, off, action, south, of, torre, n, and, instead, to, divert, to, attack, saltillo, he, threatened, to, cut, off, villa, s, coal, supply, immobilizing, his, supply, trains, if, he, did, not, comply, this, was, seen, widely, as, an, attempt, by, carranza, to, divert, villa, from, a, direct, assault, on, mexico, city, in, order, to, allow, carranza, s, forces, under, obreg, n, driving, in, from, the, west, via, guadalajara, to, take, the, capital, first, this, was, an, expensive, and, disruptive, diversion, for, the, divisi, n, del, norte, villa, s, enlisted, men, were, not, unpaid, volunteers, but, paid, soldiers, earning, the, then, enormous, sum, of, one, peso, per, day, each, day, of, delay, cost, thousands, of, pesos, disgusted, but, having, no, practical, alternative, villa, complied, with, carranza, s, order, and, captured, the, less, important, city, of, saltillo, and, proceeded, to, give, control, of, the, land, to, carranza, in, the, hope, of, ending, the, hostility, between, the, two, carranza, refused, to, reach, any, compromise, with, villa, and, ordered, that, 5000, members, of, the, divisi, n, del, norte, be, sent, to, zacatecas, to, assist, in, its, capture, a, constitutionalist, general, had, recently, staged, an, attack, that, had, failed, due, to, the, superior, artillery, of, the, federal, forces, villa, believed, that, sending, troops, to, assist, would, only, lead, to, the, same, result, unless, he, was, to, lead, the, attack, himself, carranza, declined, to, rescind, the, order, as, he, did, not, want, villa, to, receive, the, credit, as, the, victor, of, zacatecas, upon, receiving, carranza, s, refusal, villa, resigned, from, his, post, which, further, led, to, the, majority, of, revolutionary, generals, rallying, behind, villa, felipe, ngeles, and, the, rest, of, villa, s, staff, officers, argued, for, villa, to, withdraw, his, resignation, and, proceed, to, attack, zacatecas, a, strategic, railroad, station, heavily, defended, by, federal, troops, and, considered, nearly, impregnable, zacatecas, was, the, source, of, much, of, mexico, s, silver, and, thus, a, supply, of, funds, for, whoever, held, it, villa, accepted, his, staff, s, advice, and, cancelled, his, resignation, and, the, divisi, n, del, norte, defied, carranza, and, attacked, zacatecas, fighting, up, steep, slopes, the, divisi, n, del, norte, defeated, a, force, of, 12, 000, federals, in, the, toma, de, zacatecas, taking, of, zacatecas, the, single, bloodiest, battle, of, the, revolution, with, federal, casualties, numbering, approximately, 7, 000, dead, and, 5, 000, wounded, and, unknown, numbers, of, civilian, casualties, villa, s, victory, at, zacatecas, in, june, 1914, broke, the, back, of, the, huerta, regime, huerta, left, the, country, on, 14, july, 1914, the, federal, army, collapsed, ceasing, to, exist, as, an, institution, as, villa, moved, towards, the, capital, his, progress, was, halted, due, to, a, lack, of, coal, to, fuel, the, railroad, engines, and, critically, an, embargo, placed, by, the, u, s, government, on, importation, to, mexico, before, this, villa, had, strong, relationships, with, the, wilson, administration, due, in, part, to, carranza, s, distinctly, anti, american, rhetoric, with, which, villa, publicly, disagreed, although, nothing, had, changed, for, villa, historian, friedrich, katz, writes, that, the, exact, motives, of, the, u, s, government, are, hotly, contested, it, is, likely, that, it, was, attempting, to, establish, some, type, of, control, over, mexico, by, not, allowing, any, one, faction, to, become, powerful, enough, to, not, need, u, s, assistance, the, break, between, villa, and, carranza, had, been, anticipated, the, pact, of, torre, n, an, agreement, between, the, division, of, the, northeast, and, villa, s, division, of, the, north, was, a, stopgap, to, keep, the, constitutionalists, united, prior, to, the, defeat, of, the, federal, army, the, pact, was, ostensibly, an, updating, of, carranza, s, narrow, plan, of, guadalupe, adding, radical, language, about, land, distribution, and, sanctions, for, the, roman, catholic, church, for, its, support, of, huerta, neither, villa, nor, carranza, took, the, provisions, of, the, pact, seriously, one, which, was, for, carranza, to, renew, the, flow, of, ammunition, to, villa, and, supply, coal, so, his, troops, could, be, transported, by, train, the, truce, between, villa, and, carranza, held, long, enough, for, the, final, defeat, and, dissolution, of, the, federal, army, in, august, 1914, carranza, and, his, revolutionary, army, entered, mexico, city, ahead, of, villa, the, unity, of, fighting, against, huerta, was, no, longer, the, underpinnings, of, the, constitutionalists, under, carranza, s, leadership, carranza, was, a, wealthy, estate, owner, and, governor, of, coahuila, and, he, considered, villa, little, more, than, a, bandit, despite, his, military, successes, villa, viewed, carranza, as, a, soft, civilian, while, villa, s, division, of, the, north, was, the, largest, and, most, successful, revolutionary, army, in, august, and, september, obreg, n, traveled, to, meet, with, and, persuade, villa, not, to, fracture, the, constitutionalist, movement, in, their, august, meeting, the, two, agreed, that, carranza, should, now, take, the, title, of, interim, president, of, mexico, now, that, huerta, had, been, ousted, despite, the, generals, joint, petition, carranza, did, not, want, to, do, that, since, it, would, have, meant, being, ineligible, to, run, in, the, expected, presidential, election, the, two, also, agreed, that, there, should, be, immediate, action, on, land, reform, they, also, agreed, that, the, military, needed, to, be, separated, from, politics, by, the, time, of, obreg, n, s, second, meeting, with, villa, in, september, obreg, n, had, given, up, on, coming, to, an, agreement, with, him, but, he, hoped, to, lure, soldiers, of, the, division, of, the, north, away, from, villa, sensing, that, some, disapproved, of, villa, s, violent, tendencies, during, the, visit, villa, became, incensed, at, obreg, n, and, called, for, a, firing, squad, to, execute, him, immediately, obreg, n, soothed, him, and, villa, dismissed, the, squad, villa, allowed, obreg, n, to, leave, by, train, to, mexico, city, but, then, villa, attempted, to, stop, the, train, and, bring, obreg, n, back, to, chihuahua, the, telegram, was, not, received, or, was, ignored, and, obreg, n, arrived, safely, in, the, capital, even, though, obreg, n, had, his, differences, with, carranza, his, two, visits, with, villa, convinced, him, to, remain, loyal, for, the, moment, to, the, civilian, first, chief, obreg, n, saw, villa, as, a, bandit, who, would, not, keep, his, promises, villa, broke, with, carranza, in, september, 1914, and, issued, a, manifesto, once, huerta, was, ousted, the, power, struggle, between, factions, of, the, revolution, came, into, the, open, the, revolutionary, caudillos, convened, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, attempting, to, sort, out, power, in, the, political, sphere, rather, than, on, the, battlefield, this, meeting, set, out, a, path, towards, democracy, none, of, the, armed, revolutionaries, were, allowed, to, be, nominated, for, government, positions, and, eulalio, guti, rrez, was, chosen, as, interim, president, emiliano, zapata, a, military, general, from, southern, mexico, also, sent, a, number, of, delegates, to, the, convention, however, these, delegates, did, not, participate, until, they, were, convinced, the, convention, aimed, for, true, reform, and, an, alliance, was, made, between, zapata, s, forces, and, villa, s, zapata, was, sympathetic, to, villa, s, hostile, views, of, carranza, and, told, villa, he, feared, carranza, s, intentions, were, those, of, a, dictator, and, not, of, a, democratic, president, fearing, that, carranza, was, intending, to, impose, a, dictatorship, villa, and, zapata, broke, with, him, carranza, opposed, the, agreements, of, the, convention, which, rejected, his, leadership, as, first, chief, of, the, revolution, the, army, of, the, convention, was, constituted, with, the, alliance, of, villa, and, zapata, and, a, civil, war, of, the, winners, ensued, although, both, villa, and, zapata, were, defeated, in, their, attempt, to, advance, an, alternative, state, power, their, social, demands, were, copied, in, their, way, by, their, adversaries, obreg, n, and, carranza, carranza, and, alvaro, obreg, n, retreated, to, veracruz, leaving, villa, and, zapata, to, occupy, mexico, city, although, villa, had, a, more, formidable, army, and, had, demonstrated, his, brilliance, in, battle, against, the, now, defunct, federal, army, carranza, s, general, obreg, n, was, a, better, tactician, with, obreg, n, s, help, carranza, was, able, to, use, the, mexican, press, to, portray, villa, as, a, sociopathic, bandit, and, undermine, his, standing, with, the, u, s, in, late, 1914, villa, was, dealt, an, additional, blow, with, the, death, from, typhus, of, toribio, ortega, one, of, his, top, generals, 273, while, convention, forces, occupied, mexico, city, carranza, maintained, control, over, two, key, mexican, states, veracruz, and, tamaulipas, where, mexico, s, two, largest, ports, were, located, carranza, was, able, to, collect, more, revenue, than, villa, in, 1915, villa, was, forced, to, abandon, the, capital, after, a, number, of, incidents, involving, his, troops, which, helped, pave, the, way, for, the, return, of, carranza, and, his, followers, to, combat, villa, carranza, sent, his, ablest, general, obreg, n, north, who, defeated, villa, in, a, series, of, battles, meeting, at, the, battle, of, celaya, in, the, baj, o, villa, and, obreg, n, first, fought, from, 6, to, 15, april, 1915, and, villa, s, army, was, defeated, badly, suffering, 4, 000, killed, and, 6, 000, captured, obreg, n, engaged, villa, again, at, the, battle, of, trinidad, which, was, fought, between, 29, april, and, 5, june, 1915, where, villa, suffered, another, huge, loss, in, october, 1915, villa, crossed, into, sonora, the, main, stronghold, of, obreg, n, and, carranza, s, armies, where, he, hoped, to, crush, carranza, s, regime, however, carranza, had, reinforced, sonora, and, villa, again, was, defeated, badly, rodolfo, fierro, a, loyal, officer, and, cruel, hatchet, man, was, killed, while, villa, s, army, was, crossing, into, sonora, after, losing, the, battle, of, agua, prieta, in, sonora, an, overwhelming, number, of, villa, s, men, in, the, division, del, norte, were, killed, and, 1, 500, of, the, army, s, surviving, members, soon, turned, on, him, accepting, an, amnesty, offer, from, carranza, villa, s, army, reduced, to, the, condition, to, which, it, had, reduced, huerta, s, in, 1914, the, celebrated, division, of, the, north, thus, was, eliminated, as, a, capital, military, force, in, november, 1915, carranza, s, forces, captured, and, executed, contreras, pereyra, and, son, 262, severianco, ceniceros, also, accepted, amnesty, from, carranza, and, turned, on, villa, as, well, 262, although, villa, s, secretary, perez, rul, also, broke, with, villa, he, refused, to, become, a, supporter, of, carranza, 832, only, 200, men, in, villa, s, army, remained, loyal, to, him, and, he, was, forced, to, retreat, back, into, the, mountains, of, chihuahua, however, villa, and, his, men, were, determined, to, keep, fighting, carranza, s, forces, villa, s, position, further, was, weakened, by, the, united, states, refusal, to, sell, him, weapons, by, the, end, of, 1915, villa, was, on, the, run, and, the, united, states, government, recognized, carranza, the, period, after, villa, s, defeat, by, obreg, n, has, many, dark, episodes, his, fighting, force, had, shrunk, significantly, no, longer, an, army, villa, s, opponents, believed, him, finished, as, a, factor, in, the, revolution, he, decided, to, split, his, remaining, forces, into, independent, bands, under, his, authority, ban, soldaderas, and, take, to, the, hills, as, guerrillas, this, strategy, was, effective, and, one, that, villa, knew, well, from, his, bandit, days, he, had, loyal, followers, from, western, chihuahua, and, northern, durango, a, pattern, of, towns, being, under, government, control, and, the, countryside, under, guerrilla, control, reasserted, itself, civilian, populations, during, warfare, are, often, the, victims, of, violence, in, namiquipa, villa, sought, to, punish, civilians, who, had, formed, a, home, guard, but, when, they, learned, villa, s, men, were, approaching, the, village, men, took, to, the, hills, leaving, their, families, behind, villa, rounded, up, the, wives, and, allowed, his, soldiers, to, rape, them, the, story, of, the, rapes, in, namiquipa, was, spread, throughout, chihuahua, some, historians, have, contended, that, crimes, that, he, did, not, commit, have, been, attributed, to, him, in, addition, his, enemies, always, told, false, stories, to, increase, his, status, as, an, evil, person, since, there, were, cases, of, bandits, who, were, not, part, of, the, revolution, and, committed, crimes, which, were, later, attributed, to, villa, after, years, of, public, and, documented, support, for, villa, s, fight, the, united, states, refused, to, allow, more, arms, to, be, supplied, to, his, army, and, allowed, carranza, s, troops, to, be, relocated, over, u, s, railroads, in, the, second, battle, of, aguaprieta, woodrow, wilson, believed, that, supporting, carranza, was, the, best, way, to, expedite, establishment, of, a, stable, mexican, government, villa, was, further, enraged, by, obreg, n, s, use, of, searchlights, powered, by, u, s, generated, electricity, to, help, repel, a, villista, night, attack, on, the, border, town, of, agua, prieta, sonora, on, 1, november, 1915, in, mexico, and, u, s, bordering, towns, a, vendetta, was, launched, by, villa, against, americans, as, he, blamed, wilson, for, his, defeat, against, carranza, in, january, 1916, a, group, of, villistas, attacked, a, train, on, the, mexico, north, western, railway, near, santa, isabel, chihuahua, and, killed, a, number, of, u, s, nationals, employed, by, the, american, smelting, and, refining, company, the, passengers, included, eighteen, americans, 15, of, whom, worked, for, american, smelting, there, was, only, one, survivor, who, gave, the, details, to, the, press, villa, admitted, to, ordering, the, attack, but, denied, that, he, had, authorized, the, shedding, of, blood, of, u, s, citizens, after, meeting, with, a, mexican, mayor, named, juan, mu, oz, villa, recruited, more, men, into, his, guerrilla, militia, and, had, 400, men, under, his, command, villa, then, met, with, his, lieutenants, martin, lopez, pablo, lopez, francisco, beltran, and, candelario, cervantes, and, commissioned, an, additional, 100, men, to, the, command, of, joaquin, alvarez, bernabe, cifuentes, and, ernesto, rios, pablo, lopez, and, cervantes, were, later, killed, in, the, early, part, of, 1916, 364, villa, and, his, 500, guerrillas, then, started, planning, an, attack, on, u, s, soil, on, 9, march, 1916, general, villa, ordered, nearly, 100, mexican, members, of, his, revolutionary, group, to, make, a, cross, border, attack, against, columbus, new, mexico, while, some, believed, the, raid, was, conducted, because, of, the, u, s, government, s, official, recognition, of, the, carranza, regime, and, for, the, loss, of, lives, in, battle, due, to, defective, cartridges, purchased, from, the, u, s, it, was, accepted, from, a, military, standpoint, that, villa, carried, out, the, raid, because, he, needed, more, military, equipment, and, supplies, in, order, to, continue, his, fight, against, carranza, they, attacked, a, detachment, of, the, 13th, cavalry, regiment, united, states, burned, the, town, and, seized, 100, horses, and, mules, and, other, military, supplies, eighteen, americans, and, about, 80, villistas, were, killed, other, attacks, in, u, s, territory, allegedly, were, carried, out, by, villa, but, none, of, these, attacks, were, confirmed, to, have, been, carried, out, by, villistas, these, were, in, response, to, villa, s, raid, on, columbus, president, wilson, sent, 5, 000, u, s, army, soldiers, under, the, command, of, general, frederick, funston, who, oversaw, john, pershing, as, he, pursued, villa, through, mexico, employing, aircraft, and, trucks, for, the, first, time, in, u, s, army, history, pershing, s, force, fruitlessly, pursued, villa, until, february, 1917, villa, eluded, them, but, some, of, his, senior, commanders, including, colonel, candelario, cervantes, general, francisco, beltr, n, beltr, n, s, son, villa, s, second, in, command, julio, c, rdenas, and, a, total, of, 190, of, his, men, were, killed, during, the, expedition, the, carranza, government, and, the, mexican, population, were, against, u, s, troops, violating, mexican, territories, there, were, several, demonstrations, of, opposition, to, the, punitive, expedition, during, the, expedition, carranza, s, forces, captured, one, of, villa, s, top, generals, pablo, l, pez, and, executed, him, on, 5, june, 1916, before, the, villa, carranza, irregular, forces, had, left, to, the, mountains, in, 1915, there, is, no, credible, evidence, that, villa, cooperated, with, or, accepted, any, help, from, the, german, government, or, agents, villa, was, supplied, arms, from, the, u, s, employed, international, mercenaries, and, doctors, including, americans, was, portrayed, as, a, hero, in, the, u, s, media, made, business, arrangements, with, hollywood, and, did, not, object, to, the, 1914, u, s, naval, occupation, of, veracruz, villa, s, observation, was, that, the, occupation, merely, hurt, huerta, villa, opposed, the, armed, participation, of, the, united, states, in, mexico, but, he, did, not, act, against, the, veracruz, occupation, in, order, to, maintain, the, connections, in, the, u, s, that, were, necessary, to, buy, american, cartridges, and, other, supplies, the, german, consul, in, torre, n, made, entreaties, to, villa, offering, him, arms, and, money, to, occupy, the, port, and, oil, fields, of, tampico, to, enable, german, ships, to, dock, there, but, villa, rejected, the, offer, german, agents, tried, to, interfere, in, the, mexican, revolution, but, were, unsuccessful, they, attempted, to, plot, with, victoriano, huerta, to, assist, him, to, retake, the, country, and, in, the, infamous, zimmermann, telegram, to, the, mexican, government, proposed, an, alliance, with, the, government, of, venustiano, carranza, there, were, documented, contacts, between, villa, and, the, germans, after, villa, s, split, with, the, constitutionalists, this, was, principally, in, the, person, of, felix, a, sommerfeld, noted, in, katz, s, book, who, allegedly, funneled, 340, 000, of, german, money, to, the, western, cartridge, company, in, 1915, to, purchase, ammunition, sommerfeld, had, been, villa, s, representative, in, the, united, states, since, 1914, and, had, close, contact, with, the, german, naval, attach, in, washington, karl, boy, ed, as, well, as, other, german, agents, in, the, united, states, including, franz, von, rintelen, and, horst, von, der, goltz, in, may, 1914, sommerfeld, formally, entered, the, employ, of, boy, ed, and, the, german, secret, service, in, the, united, states, however, villa, s, actions, were, hardly, that, of, a, german, catspaw, rather, it, appeared, that, villa, resorted, to, german, assistance, only, after, other, sources, of, money, and, arms, were, cut, off, at, the, time, of, villa, s, 1916, attack, on, columbus, new, mexico, villa, s, military, power, had, been, marginalized, he, was, repulsed, at, columbus, by, a, small, cavalry, detachment, albeit, after, doing, a, lot, of, damage, his, theater, of, operations, was, limited, mainly, to, western, chihuahua, he, was, persona, non, grata, with, mexico, s, ruling, carranza, constitutionalists, and, was, the, subject, of, an, embargo, by, the, u, s, so, communication, or, further, shipments, of, arms, between, the, germans, and, villa, would, have, been, difficult, a, plausible, explanation, for, contacts, between, villa, and, the, germans, after, 1915, is, that, they, were, a, futile, extension, of, increasingly, desperate, german, diplomatic, efforts, and, villista, dreams, of, victory, as, progress, of, their, respective, wars, bogged, down, villa, effectively, did, not, have, anything, useful, to, offer, in, exchange, for, german, help, at, that, point, when, assessing, claims, of, villa, conspiring, with, germans, portrayal, of, villa, as, a, german, sympathizer, served, the, propaganda, needs, of, both, carranza, and, wilson, and, has, to, be, taken, into, account, the, use, of, mauser, rifles, and, carbines, by, villa, s, forces, does, not, necessarily, indicate, a, german, connection, these, weapons, were, used, widely, by, all, parties, in, the, mexican, revolution, mauser, longarms, being, enormously, popular, they, were, standard, issue, in, the, mexican, army, which, had, begun, adopting, 7, mm, mauser, system, arms, as, early, as, 1895, following, his, unsuccessful, military, campaign, at, celaya, and, the, 1916, incursion, into, new, mexico, prompting, the, unsuccessful, u, s, military, intervention, in, mexico, to, capture, him, villa, ceased, to, be, a, national, leader, and, became, a, leader, in, chihuahua, while, villa, still, remained, active, carranza, shifted, his, focus, to, dealing, with, the, more, dangerous, threat, posed, by, zapata, in, the, south, villa, s, last, major, military, action, was, a, raid, against, ciudad, ju, rez, in, 1919, following, the, raid, villa, suffered, yet, another, major, blow, after, felipe, angeles, who, had, returned, to, mexico, in, 1918, after, living, in, exile, for, three, years, as, a, dairy, farmer, in, texas, left, villa, and, his, small, remaining, militia, angeles, later, was, captured, by, carranza, s, forces, and, was, executed, on, 26, november, 1919, villa, continued, fighting, and, conducted, a, small, siege, in, ascenci, n, durango, after, his, failed, raid, in, ciudad, ju, rez, the, siege, failed, and, villa, s, new, second, in, command, his, longtime, lieutenant, mart, n, l, pez, was, killed, during, the, fighting, at, this, point, villa, agreed, that, he, would, cease, fighting, if, it, were, made, worth, his, while, on, 21, may, 1920, a, break, for, villa, came, when, carranza, along, with, his, top, advisers, and, supporters, was, assassinated, by, supporters, of, lvaro, obreg, n, with, his, nemesis, dead, villa, was, now, ready, to, negotiate, a, peace, settlement, and, retire, on, 22, july, 1920, villa, finally, was, able, to, send, a, telegram, to, mexican, interim, president, adolfo, de, la, huerta, which, stated, that, he, recognized, de, la, huerta, s, presidency, and, requested, amnesty, six, days, later, de, la, huerta, met, with, villa, and, negotiated, a, peace, settlement, in, exchange, for, his, retirement, from, hostilities, villa, was, granted, a, 25, 000, acre, hacienda, in, canutillo, just, outside, hidalgo, del, parral, chihuahua, by, the, national, government, this, was, in, addition, to, the, quinta, luz, estate, that, he, owned, with, his, wife, mar, a, luz, corral, de, villa, in, chihuahua, chihuahua, the, last, remaining, 200, guerrillas, and, veterans, of, villa, s, militia, who, were, still, loyal, to, him, would, reside, with, him, in, his, new, hacienda, as, well, and, the, mexican, government, also, granted, them, a, pension, that, totalled, 500, 000, gold, pesos, the, 50, guerrillas, who, still, remained, in, villa, s, small, cavalry, would, be, allowed, to, serve, as, villa, s, personal, bodyguards, as, villa, s, biographer, friedrich, katz, has, noted, during, his, lifetime, villa, had, never, bothered, with, conventional, arrangements, in, his, family, life, and, he, contracted, several, marriages, without, seeking, annulment, or, divorce, on, 29, may, 1911, villa, married, mar, a, luz, corral, who, has, been, described, as, the, most, articulate, of, his, many, wives, villa, met, her, when, she, was, living, with, her, widowed, mother, in, san, andr, s, where, villa, for, a, time, had, his, headquarters, anti, reelectionists, threatened, the, locals, for, monetary, contributions, to, their, cause, which, the, two, women, could, not, afford, the, widow, corral, did, not, want, to, seem, a, counter, revolutionary, and, went, to, villa, who, allowed, her, to, make, a, token, contribution, to, the, cause, villa, sought, luz, corral, as, his, wife, but, her, mother, was, opposed, however, the, two, were, married, by, a, priest, in, a, great, ceremony, attended, by, his, military, chiefs, and, a, representative, of, the, governor, a, photo, of, corral, with, villa, dated, 1914, has, been, published, in, a, collection, of, photos, from, the, revolution, it, shows, a, sturdy, woman, with, her, hair, in, a, bun, wearing, a, floor, length, embellished, skirt, and, a, white, blouse, with, a, rebozo, beside, a, smiling, villa, after, villa, s, death, luz, corral, s, marriage, to, villa, was, challenged, in, court, twice, and, both, times, it, was, upheld, as, valid, together, villa, and, luz, corral, had, one, child, a, daughter, who, died, within, a, few, years, after, birth, villa, had, long, term, relationships, with, several, women, austreberta, renter, a, was, villa, s, official, wife, at, his, hacienda, of, canutillo, and, villa, had, two, sons, with, her, francisco, and, hip, lito, others, were, soledad, sea, ez, juana, torres, whom, he, wed, in, 1913, and, with, whom, he, had, a, daughter, still, another, woman, in, villa, s, life, was, manuela, casas, with, whom, villa, had, a, son, named, trinidad, villa, he, became, john, wayne, s, double, in, many, movies, in, the, state, of, durango, manuela, casas, would, be, the, last, woman, who, saw, him, alive, in, parral, chihuahua, at, the, time, of, villa, s, assassination, in, 1923, luz, corral, was, banished, from, canutillo, however, she, was, recognized, by, mexican, courts, as, villa, s, legal, wife, and, therefore, heir, to, villa, s, estate, president, obreg, n, intervened, in, the, dispute, between, competing, claims, to, villa, s, estate, in, luz, corral, s, favor, perhaps, because, she, had, saved, his, life, when, villa, threatened, to, execute, him, in, 1914, renter, a, and, sea, ez, eventually, were, granted, small, government, pensions, decades, after, villa, s, death, corral, inherited, villa, s, estate, and, played, a, key, role, in, maintaining, his, public, memory, all,
