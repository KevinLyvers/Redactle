werner, karl, heisenberg, h, a, z, n, b, r, german, 5, december, 1901, 1, february, 1976, was, a, german, theoretical, physicist, one, of, the, main, pioneers, of, the, theory, of, quantum, mechanics, and, a, principal, scientist, in, the, nazi, nuclear, weapons, program, during, world, war, ii, he, published, his, umdeutung, paper, in, 1925, a, major, reinterpretation, of, old, quantum, theory, in, the, subsequent, series, of, papers, with, max, born, and, pascual, jordan, during, the, same, year, his, matrix, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, was, substantially, elaborated, he, is, known, for, the, uncertainty, principle, which, he, published, in, 1927, heisenberg, was, awarded, the, 1932, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, the, creation, of, quantum, mechanics, heisenberg, also, made, contributions, to, the, theories, of, the, hydrodynamics, of, turbulent, flows, the, atomic, nucleus, ferromagnetism, cosmic, rays, and, subatomic, particles, he, was, also, instrumental, in, planning, the, first, west, german, nuclear, reactor, at, karlsruhe, together, with, a, research, reactor, in, munich, in, 1957, following, world, war, ii, he, was, appointed, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, which, soon, thereafter, was, renamed, the, max, planck, institute, for, physics, he, was, director, of, the, institute, until, it, was, moved, to, munich, in, 1958, he, then, became, director, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, physics, and, astrophysics, from, 1960, to, 1970, heisenberg, was, also, president, of, the, german, research, council, chairman, of, the, commission, for, atomic, physics, chairman, of, the, nuclear, physics, working, group, and, president, of, the, alexander, von, humboldt, foundation, werner, karl, heisenberg, was, born, in, w, rzburg, germany, to, kaspar, ernst, august, heisenberg, and, his, wife, annie, wecklein, his, father, was, a, secondary, school, teacher, of, classical, languages, who, became, germany, s, only, ordentlicher, professor, ordinarius, professor, of, medieval, and, modern, greek, studies, in, the, university, system, heisenberg, was, raised, and, lived, as, a, lutheran, christian, in, his, late, teenage, years, heisenberg, read, plato, s, timaeus, while, hiking, in, the, bavarian, alps, he, recounted, philosophical, conversations, with, his, fellow, students, and, teachers, about, understanding, the, atom, while, receiving, his, scientific, training, in, munich, g, ttingen, and, copenhagen, heisenberg, later, stated, that, my, mind, was, formed, by, studying, philosophy, plato, and, that, sort, of, thing, and, that, modern, physics, has, definitely, decided, in, favor, of, plato, in, fact, the, smallest, units, of, matter, are, not, physical, objects, in, the, ordinary, sense, they, are, forms, ideas, which, can, be, expressed, unambiguously, only, in, mathematical, language, in, 1919, heisenberg, arrived, in, munich, as, a, member, of, the, freikorps, to, fight, the, bavarian, soviet, republic, established, a, year, earlier, five, decades, later, he, recalled, those, days, as, youthful, fun, like, playing, cops, and, robbers, and, so, on, it, was, nothing, serious, at, all, his, duties, were, restricted, to, seizing, bicycles, or, typewriters, from, red, administrative, buildings, and, guarding, suspected, red, prisoners, from, 1920, to, 1923, he, studied, physics, and, mathematics, at, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, under, arnold, sommerfeld, and, wilhelm, wien, and, at, the, georg, august, university, of, g, ttingen, with, max, born, and, james, franck, and, mathematics, with, david, hilbert, he, received, his, doctorate, in, 1923, at, munich, under, sommerfeld, at, g, ttingen, under, born, he, completed, his, habilitation, in, 1924, with, a, habilitationsschrift, habilitation, thesis, on, the, anomalous, zeeman, effect, in, june, 1922, sommerfeld, took, heisenberg, to, g, ttingen, to, attend, the, bohr, festival, because, sommerfeld, had, a, sincere, interest, in, his, students, and, knew, of, heisenberg, s, interest, in, niels, bohr, s, theories, on, atomic, physics, at, the, event, bohr, was, a, guest, lecturer, and, gave, a, series, of, comprehensive, lectures, on, quantum, atomic, physics, and, heisenberg, met, bohr, for, the, first, time, which, had, a, lasting, effect, on, him, heisenberg, s, doctoral, thesis, the, topic, of, which, was, suggested, by, sommerfeld, was, on, turbulence, the, thesis, discussed, both, the, stability, of, laminar, flow, and, the, nature, of, turbulent, flow, the, problem, of, stability, was, investigated, by, the, use, of, the, orr, sommerfeld, equation, a, fourth, order, linear, differential, equation, for, small, disturbances, from, laminar, flow, he, briefly, returned, to, this, topic, after, world, war, ii, in, his, youth, he, was, a, member, and, scoutleader, of, the, neupfadfinder, a, german, scout, association, and, part, of, the, german, youth, movement, in, august, 1923, robert, honsell, and, heisenberg, organized, a, trip, to, finland, with, a, scout, group, of, this, association, from, munich, heisenberg, enjoyed, classical, music, and, was, an, accomplished, pianist, his, interest, in, music, led, to, meeting, his, future, wife, in, january, 1937, heisenberg, met, elisabeth, schumacher, 1914, 1998, at, a, private, music, recital, elisabeth, was, the, daughter, of, a, well, known, berlin, economics, professor, and, her, brother, was, the, economist, e, f, schumacher, author, of, small, is, beautiful, heisenberg, married, her, on, 29, april, fraternal, twins, maria, and, wolfgang, were, born, in, january, 1938, whereupon, wolfgang, pauli, congratulated, heisenberg, on, his, pair, creation, a, wordplay, on, a, process, from, elementary, particle, physics, pair, production, they, had, five, more, children, over, the, next, 12, years, barbara, christine, jochen, martin, and, verena, in, 1939, he, bought, a, summer, home, for, his, family, in, urfeld, am, walchensee, in, southern, germany, one, of, heisenberg, s, sons, martin, heisenberg, became, a, neurobiologist, at, the, university, of, w, rzburg, while, another, son, jochen, heisenberg, became, a, physics, professor, at, the, university, of, new, hampshire, from, 1924, to, 1927, heisenberg, was, a, privatdozent, at, g, ttingen, meaning, he, was, qualified, to, teach, and, examine, independently, without, having, a, chair, from, 17, september, 1924, to, 1, may, 1925, under, an, international, education, board, rockefeller, foundation, fellowship, heisenberg, went, to, do, research, with, niels, bohr, director, of, the, institute, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, his, seminal, paper, ber, quantentheoretische, umdeutung, kinematischer, und, mechanischer, beziehungen, quantum, theoretical, re, interpretation, of, kinematic, and, mechanical, relations, also, called, the, umdeutung, reinterpretation, paper, was, published, in, september, 1925, he, returned, to, g, ttingen, and, with, max, born, and, pascual, jordan, over, a, period, of, about, six, months, developed, the, matrix, mechanics, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, on, 1, may, 1926, heisenberg, began, his, appointment, as, a, university, lecturer, and, assistant, to, bohr, in, copenhagen, it, was, in, copenhagen, in, 1927, that, heisenberg, developed, his, uncertainty, principle, while, working, on, the, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, on, 23, february, heisenberg, wrote, a, letter, to, fellow, physicist, wolfgang, pauli, in, which, he, first, described, his, new, principle, in, his, paper, on, the, principle, heisenberg, used, the, word, ungenauigkeit, imprecision, not, uncertainty, to, describe, it, in, 1927, heisenberg, was, appointed, ordentlicher, professor, professor, ordinarius, of, theoretical, physics, and, head, of, the, department, of, physics, at, the, university, of, leipzig, he, gave, his, inaugural, lecture, there, on, 1, february, 1928, in, his, first, paper, published, from, leipzig, heisenberg, used, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, to, solve, the, mystery, of, ferromagnetism, during, heisenberg, s, tenure, at, leipzig, the, high, quality, of, the, doctoral, students, and, post, graduate, and, research, associates, who, studied, and, worked, with, him, is, clear, from, the, acclaim, many, later, earned, at, various, times, they, included, erich, bagge, felix, bloch, ugo, fano, siegfried, fl, gge, william, vermillion, houston, friedrich, hund, robert, s, mulliken, rudolf, peierls, george, placzek, isidor, isaac, rabi, fritz, sauter, john, c, slater, edward, teller, john, hasbrouck, van, vleck, victor, frederick, weisskopf, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, gregor, wentzel, and, clarence, zener, at, 25, years, old, heisenberg, gained, the, title, of, the, youngest, full, time, professor, in, germany, and, professorial, chair, of, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, leipzig, he, taught, lectures, that, physicists, like, edward, teller, and, robert, oppenheimer, would, attend, who, would, later, work, on, the, manhattan, project, for, the, united, states, in, early, 1929, heisenberg, and, pauli, submitted, the, first, of, two, papers, laying, the, foundation, for, relativistic, quantum, field, theory, also, in, 1929, heisenberg, went, on, a, lecture, tour, of, china, japan, india, and, the, united, states, in, the, spring, of, 1929, he, was, a, visiting, lecturer, at, the, university, of, chicago, where, he, lectured, on, quantum, mechanics, in, 1928, the, british, mathematical, physicist, paul, dirac, had, derived, his, relativistic, wave, equation, of, quantum, mechanics, which, implied, the, existence, of, positive, electrons, later, to, be, named, positrons, in, 1932, from, a, cloud, chamber, photograph, of, cosmic, rays, the, american, physicist, carl, david, anderson, identified, a, track, as, having, been, made, by, a, positron, in, mid, 1933, heisenberg, presented, his, theory, of, the, positron, his, thinking, on, dirac, s, theory, and, further, development, of, the, theory, were, set, forth, in, two, papers, the, first, bemerkungen, zur, diracschen, theorie, des, positrons, remarks, on, dirac, s, theory, of, the, positron, was, published, in, 1934, and, the, second, folgerungen, aus, der, diracschen, theorie, des, positrons, consequences, of, dirac, s, theory, of, the, positron, was, published, in, 1936, in, these, papers, heisenberg, was, the, first, to, reinterpret, the, dirac, equation, as, a, classical, field, equation, for, any, point, particle, of, spin, 2, itself, subject, to, quantization, conditions, involving, anti, commutators, thus, reinterpreting, it, as, a, quantum, field, equation, accurately, describing, electrons, heisenberg, put, matter, on, the, same, footing, as, electromagnetism, as, being, described, by, relativistic, quantum, field, equations, which, allowed, the, possibility, of, particle, creation, and, destruction, hermann, weyl, had, already, described, this, in, a, 1929, letter, to, albert, einstein, heisenberg, s, umdeutung, paper, that, established, modern, quantum, mechanics, has, puzzled, physicists, and, historians, his, methods, assume, that, the, reader, is, familiar, with, kramers, heisenberg, transition, probability, calculations, the, main, new, idea, non, commuting, matrices, is, justified, only, by, a, rejection, of, unobservable, quantities, it, introduces, the, non, commutative, multiplication, of, matrices, by, physical, reasoning, based, on, the, correspondence, principle, despite, the, fact, that, heisenberg, was, not, then, familiar, with, the, mathematical, theory, of, matrices, the, path, leading, to, these, results, has, been, reconstructed, by, mackinnon, and, the, detailed, calculations, are, worked, out, by, aitchison, and, coauthors, in, copenhagen, heisenberg, and, hans, kramers, collaborated, on, a, paper, on, dispersion, or, the, scattering, from, atoms, of, radiation, whose, wavelength, is, larger, than, the, atoms, they, showed, that, the, successful, formula, kramers, had, developed, earlier, could, not, be, based, on, bohr, orbits, because, the, transition, frequencies, are, based, on, level, spacings, which, are, not, constant, the, frequencies, which, occur, in, the, fourier, transform, of, the, classical, sharp, series, orbits, by, contrast, are, equally, spaced, but, these, results, could, be, explained, by, a, semi, classical, virtual, state, model, the, incoming, radiation, excites, the, valence, or, outer, electron, to, a, virtual, state, from, which, it, decays, in, a, subsequent, paper, heisenberg, showed, that, this, virtual, oscillator, model, could, also, explain, the, polarization, of, fluorescent, radiation, these, two, successes, and, the, continuing, failure, of, the, bohr, sommerfeld, model, to, explain, the, outstanding, problem, of, the, anomalous, zeeman, effect, led, heisenberg, to, use, the, virtual, oscillator, model, to, try, to, calculate, spectral, frequencies, the, method, proved, too, difficult, to, immediately, apply, to, realistic, problems, so, heisenberg, turned, to, a, simpler, example, the, anharmonic, oscillator, the, dipole, oscillator, consists, of, a, simple, harmonic, oscillator, which, is, thought, of, as, a, charged, particle, on, a, spring, perturbed, by, an, external, force, like, an, external, charge, the, motion, of, the, oscillating, charge, can, be, expressed, as, a, fourier, series, in, the, frequency, of, the, oscillator, heisenberg, solved, for, the, quantum, behavior, by, two, different, methods, first, he, treated, the, system, with, the, virtual, oscillator, method, calculating, the, transitions, between, the, levels, that, would, be, produced, by, the, external, source, he, then, solved, the, same, problem, by, treating, the, anharmonic, potential, term, as, a, perturbation, to, the, harmonic, oscillator, and, using, the, perturbation, methods, that, he, and, born, had, developed, both, methods, led, to, the, same, results, for, the, first, and, the, very, complicated, second, order, correction, terms, this, suggested, that, behind, the, very, complicated, calculations, lay, a, consistent, scheme, so, heisenberg, set, out, to, formulate, these, results, without, any, explicit, dependence, on, the, virtual, oscillator, model, to, do, this, he, replaced, the, fourier, expansions, for, the, spatial, coordinates, with, matrices, matrices, which, corresponded, to, the, transition, coefficients, in, the, virtual, oscillator, method, he, justified, this, replacement, by, an, appeal, to, bohr, s, correspondence, principle, and, the, pauli, doctrine, that, quantum, mechanics, must, be, limited, to, observables, on, 9, july, heisenberg, gave, born, this, paper, to, review, and, submit, for, publication, when, born, read, the, paper, he, recognized, the, formulation, as, one, which, could, be, transcribed, and, extended, to, the, systematic, language, of, matrices, which, he, had, learned, from, his, study, under, jakob, rosanes, at, breslau, university, born, with, the, help, of, his, assistant, and, former, student, pascual, jordan, began, immediately, to, make, the, transcription, and, extension, and, they, submitted, their, results, for, publication, the, paper, was, received, for, publication, just, 60, days, after, heisenberg, s, paper, a, follow, on, paper, was, submitted, for, publication, before, the, end, of, the, year, by, all, three, authors, up, until, this, time, matrices, were, seldom, used, by, physicists, they, were, considered, to, belong, to, the, realm, of, pure, mathematics, gustav, mie, had, used, them, in, a, paper, on, electrodynamics, in, 1912, and, born, had, used, them, in, his, work, on, the, lattice, theory, of, crystals, in, 1921, while, matrices, were, used, in, these, cases, the, algebra, of, matrices, with, their, multiplication, did, not, enter, the, picture, as, they, did, in, the, matrix, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, in, 1928, albert, einstein, nominated, heisenberg, born, and, jordan, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, the, announcement, of, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, 1932, was, delayed, until, november, 1933, it, was, at, that, time, announced, that, heisenberg, had, won, the, prize, for, 1932, for, the, creation, of, quantum, mechanics, the, application, of, which, has, inter, alia, led, to, the, discovery, of, the, allotropic, forms, of, hydrogen, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, and, the, apparently, contradictory, implications, in, regard, to, what, is, real, had, profound, philosophical, implications, including, what, scientific, observations, truly, mean, in, contrast, to, albert, einstein, and, louis, de, broglie, who, were, realists, who, believed, that, particles, had, an, objectively, true, momentum, and, position, at, all, times, even, if, both, could, not, be, measured, heisenberg, was, an, anti, realist, arguing, that, direct, knowledge, of, what, is, real, was, beyond, the, scope, of, science, writing, in, his, book, the, physicist, s, conception, of, nature, heisenberg, argued, that, ultimately, we, only, can, speak, of, the, knowledge, numbers, in, tables, which, describe, something, about, particles, but, we, can, never, have, any, true, access, to, the, particles, themselves, we, can, no, longer, speak, of, the, behaviour, of, the, particle, independently, of, the, process, of, observation, as, a, final, consequence, the, natural, laws, formulated, mathematically, in, quantum, theory, no, longer, deal, with, the, elementary, particles, themselves, but, with, our, knowledge, of, them, nor, is, it, any, longer, possible, to, ask, whether, or, not, these, particles, exist, in, space, and, time, objectively, when, we, speak, of, the, picture, of, nature, in, the, exact, science, of, our, age, we, do, not, mean, a, picture, of, nature, so, much, as, a, picture, of, our, relationships, with, nature, science, no, longer, confronts, nature, as, an, objective, observer, but, sees, itself, as, an, actor, in, this, interplay, between, man, and, nature, the, scientific, method, of, analysing, explaining, and, classifying, has, become, conscious, of, its, limitations, which, arise, out, of, the, fact, that, by, its, intervention, science, alters, and, refashions, the, object, of, investigation, in, other, words, method, and, object, can, no, longer, be, separated, shortly, after, the, discovery, of, the, neutron, by, james, chadwick, in, 1932, heisenberg, submitted, the, first, of, three, papers, on, his, neutron, proton, model, of, the, nucleus, after, adolf, hitler, came, to, power, in, 1933, heisenberg, was, attacked, in, the, press, as, a, white, jew, i, e, an, aryan, who, acts, like, a, jew, supporters, of, deutsche, physik, or, german, physics, also, known, as, aryan, physics, launched, vicious, attacks, against, leading, theoretical, physicists, including, arnold, sommerfeld, and, heisenberg, from, the, early, 1930s, onward, the, anti, semitic, and, anti, theoretical, physics, movement, deutsche, physik, had, concerned, itself, with, quantum, mechanics, and, the, theory, of, relativity, as, applied, in, the, university, environment, political, factors, took, priority, over, scholarly, ability, even, though, its, two, most, prominent, supporters, were, the, nobel, laureates, in, physics, philipp, lenard, and, johannes, stark, there, had, been, many, failed, attempts, to, have, heisenberg, appointed, as, a, professor, at, a, number, of, german, universities, his, attempt, to, be, appointed, as, successor, to, arnold, sommerfeld, failed, because, of, opposition, by, the, deutsche, physik, movement, on, 1, april, 1935, the, eminent, theoretical, physicist, sommerfeld, heisenberg, s, doctoral, advisor, at, the, ludwig, maximilians, universit, t, m, nchen, achieved, emeritus, status, however, sommerfeld, stayed, in, his, chair, during, the, selection, process, for, his, successor, which, took, until, 1, december, 1939, the, process, was, lengthy, due, to, academic, and, political, differences, between, the, munich, faculty, s, selection, and, that, of, the, reich, education, ministry, and, the, supporters, of, deutsche, physik, in, 1935, the, munich, faculty, drew, up, a, list, of, candidates, to, replace, sommerfeld, as, ordinarius, professor, of, theoretical, physics, and, head, of, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, munich, the, three, candidates, had, all, been, former, students, of, sommerfeld, heisenberg, who, had, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, peter, debye, who, had, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1936, and, richard, becker, the, munich, faculty, was, firmly, behind, these, candidates, with, heisenberg, as, their, first, choice, however, supporters, of, deutsche, physik, and, elements, in, the, rem, had, their, own, list, of, candidates, and, the, battle, dragged, on, for, over, four, years, during, this, time, heisenberg, came, under, vicious, attack, by, the, deutsche, physik, supporters, one, attack, was, published, in, das, schwarze, korps, the, newspaper, of, the, ss, headed, by, heinrich, himmler, in, this, heisenberg, was, called, a, white, jew, who, should, be, made, to, disappear, these, attacks, were, taken, seriously, as, jews, were, violently, attacked, and, incarcerated, heisenberg, fought, back, with, an, editorial, and, a, letter, to, himmler, in, an, attempt, to, resolve, the, matter, and, regain, his, honour, at, one, point, heisenberg, s, mother, visited, himmler, s, mother, the, two, women, knew, each, other, as, heisenberg, s, maternal, grandfather, and, himmler, s, father, were, rectors, and, members, of, a, bavarian, hiking, club, eventually, himmler, settled, the, heisenberg, affair, by, sending, two, letters, one, to, ss, gruppenf, hrer, reinhard, heydrich, and, one, to, heisenberg, both, on, 21, july, 1938, in, the, letter, to, heydrich, himmler, said, germany, could, not, afford, to, lose, or, silence, heisenberg, as, he, would, be, useful, for, teaching, a, generation, of, scientists, to, heisenberg, himmler, said, the, letter, came, on, the, recommendation, of, his, family, and, he, cautioned, heisenberg, to, make, a, distinction, between, professional, physics, research, results, and, the, personal, and, political, attitudes, of, the, involved, scientists, wilhelm, m, ller, replaced, sommerfeld, at, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, m, ller, was, not, a, theoretical, physicist, had, not, published, in, a, physics, journal, and, was, not, a, member, of, the, german, physical, society, his, appointment, was, considered, a, travesty, and, detrimental, to, educating, theoretical, physicists, the, three, investigators, who, led, the, ss, investigation, of, heisenberg, had, training, in, physics, indeed, heisenberg, had, participated, in, the, doctoral, examination, of, one, of, them, at, the, universit, t, leipzig, the, most, influential, of, the, three, was, johannes, juilfs, during, their, investigation, they, became, supporters, of, heisenberg, as, well, as, his, position, against, the, ideological, policies, of, the, deutsche, physik, movement, in, theoretical, physics, and, academia, in, mid, 1936, heisenberg, presented, his, theory, of, cosmic, ray, showers, in, two, papers, four, more, papers, appeared, in, the, next, two, years, in, december, 1938, the, german, chemists, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, sent, a, manuscript, to, the, natural, sciences, reporting, they, had, detected, the, element, barium, after, bombarding, uranium, with, neutrons, leading, hahn, to, conclude, that, a, bursting, of, the, uranium, nucleus, had, occurred, simultaneously, hahn, communicated, these, results, to, his, friend, lise, meitner, who, had, in, july, of, that, year, fled, first, to, the, netherlands, then, to, sweden, meitner, and, her, nephew, otto, robert, frisch, correctly, interpreted, hahn, s, and, strassmann, s, results, as, being, nuclear, fission, frisch, confirmed, this, experimentally, on, 13, january, 1939, in, june, and, july, 1939, heisenberg, traveled, to, the, united, states, visiting, samuel, abraham, goudsmit, at, the, university, of, michigan, in, ann, arbor, however, heisenberg, refused, an, invitation, to, emigrate, to, the, united, states, he, did, not, see, goudsmit, again, until, six, years, later, when, goudsmit, was, the, chief, scientific, advisor, to, the, american, operation, alsos, at, the, close, of, world, war, ii, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, known, as, uranverein, was, formed, on, 1, september, 1939, the, day, world, war, ii, began, in, europe, the, heereswaffenamt, hwa, army, ordnance, office, had, squeezed, the, reichsforschungsrat, rfr, reich, research, council, out, of, the, reichserziehungsministerium, rem, reich, ministry, of, education, and, started, the, formal, german, nuclear, energy, project, under, military, auspices, the, project, had, its, first, meeting, on, 16, september, 1939, the, meeting, was, organized, by, kurt, diebner, advisor, to, the, hwa, and, held, in, berlin, the, invitees, included, walther, bothe, siegfried, fl, gge, hans, geiger, otto, hahn, paul, harteck, gerhard, hoffmann, josef, mattauch, and, georg, stetter, a, second, meeting, was, held, soon, thereafter, and, included, heisenberg, klaus, clusius, robert, d, pel, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institut, f, r, physik, kwip, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, in, berlin, dahlem, was, placed, under, hwa, authority, with, diebner, as, the, administrative, director, and, the, military, control, of, the, nuclear, research, commenced, during, the, period, when, diebner, administered, the, kwip, under, the, hwa, program, considerable, personal, and, professional, animosity, developed, between, diebner, and, heisenberg, s, inner, circle, which, included, karl, wirtz, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, at, a, scientific, conference, on, 26, 28, february, 1942, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, called, by, the, army, weapons, office, heisenberg, presented, a, lecture, to, reichs, officials, on, energy, acquisition, from, nuclear, fission, the, lecture, entitled, die, theoretischen, grundlagen, f, r, die, energiegewinnung, aus, der, uranspaltung, the, theoretical, basis, for, energy, generation, from, uranium, fission, was, as, heisenberg, wrote, after, the, second, world, war, in, a, letter, to, samuel, goudsmit, adapted, to, the, intellectual, level, of, a, reichs, minister, as, is, often, done, when, presenting, complex, and, cutting, edge, scientific, concepts, to, laymen, heisenberg, lectured, on, the, enormous, energy, potential, of, nuclear, fission, stating, that, 250, million, electron, volts, could, be, released, through, the, fission, of, an, atomic, nucleus, heisenberg, stressed, that, pure, u, 235, had, to, be, obtained, to, achieve, a, chain, reaction, he, explored, various, ways, of, obtaining, isotope, 235, 92, u, in, its, pure, form, including, uranium, enrichment, and, an, alternative, layered, method, of, normal, uranium, and, a, moderator, in, a, machine, this, machine, he, noted, could, be, used, in, practical, ways, to, fuel, vehicles, ships, and, submarines, heisenberg, stressed, the, importance, of, the, army, weapons, office, s, financial, and, material, support, for, this, scientific, endeavour, a, second, scientific, conference, followed, lectures, were, heard, on, problems, of, modern, physics, with, decisive, importance, for, the, national, defense, and, economy, the, conference, was, attended, by, bernhard, rust, the, reichs, minister, of, science, education, and, national, culture, at, the, conference, reichs, minister, rust, decided, to, take, the, nuclear, project, away, from, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, the, reichs, research, council, was, to, take, on, the, project, in, april, 1942, the, army, returned, the, physics, institute, to, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, naming, heisenberg, as, director, at, the, institute, with, this, appointment, at, the, kwip, heisenberg, obtained, his, first, professorship, peter, debye, was, still, director, of, the, institute, but, had, gone, on, leave, to, the, united, states, after, he, had, refused, to, become, a, german, citizen, when, the, hwa, took, administrative, control, of, the, kwip, heisenberg, still, also, had, his, department, of, physics, at, the, university, of, leipzig, where, work, had, been, done, for, the, uranverein, by, robert, d, pel, and, his, wife, klara, d, pel, on, 4, june, 1942, heisenberg, was, summoned, to, report, to, albert, speer, germany, s, minister, of, armaments, on, the, prospects, for, converting, the, uranverein, s, research, toward, developing, nuclear, weapons, during, the, meeting, heisenberg, told, speer, that, a, bomb, could, not, be, built, before, 1945, because, it, would, require, significant, monetary, resources, and, number, of, personnel, after, the, uranverein, project, was, placed, under, the, leadership, of, the, reichs, research, council, it, focused, on, nuclear, power, production, and, thus, maintained, its, kriegswichtig, importance, for, the, war, status, funding, therefore, continued, from, the, military, the, nuclear, power, project, was, broken, down, into, the, following, main, areas, uranium, and, heavy, water, production, uranium, isotope, separation, and, the, uranmaschine, uranium, machine, i, e, nuclear, reactor, the, project, was, then, essentially, split, up, between, a, number, of, institutes, where, the, directors, dominated, the, research, and, set, their, own, research, agendas, the, point, in, 1942, when, the, army, relinquished, its, control, of, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, was, the, zenith, of, the, project, relative, to, the, number, of, personnel, about, 70, scientists, worked, for, the, program, with, about, 40, devoting, more, than, half, their, time, to, nuclear, fission, research, after, 1942, the, number, of, scientists, working, on, applied, nuclear, fission, diminished, dramatically, many, of, the, scientists, not, working, with, the, main, institutes, stopped, working, on, nuclear, fission, and, devoted, their, efforts, to, more, pressing, war, related, work, in, september, 1942, heisenberg, submitted, his, first, paper, of, a, three, part, series, on, the, scattering, matrix, or, s, matrix, in, elementary, particle, physics, the, first, two, papers, were, published, in, 1943, and, the, third, in, 1944, the, s, matrix, described, only, the, states, of, incident, particles, in, a, collision, process, the, states, of, those, emerging, from, the, collision, and, stable, bound, states, there, would, be, no, reference, to, the, intervening, states, this, was, the, same, precedent, as, he, followed, in, 1925, in, what, turned, out, to, be, the, foundation, of, the, matrix, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, through, only, the, use, of, observables, in, february, 1943, heisenberg, was, appointed, to, the, chair, for, theoretical, physics, at, the, friedrich, wilhelms, universit, t, today, the, humboldt, universit, t, zu, berlin, in, april, his, election, to, the, preu, ische, akademie, der, wissenschaften, prussian, academy, of, sciences, was, approved, that, same, month, he, moved, his, family, to, their, retreat, in, urfeld, as, allied, bombing, increased, in, berlin, in, the, summer, he, dispatched, the, first, of, his, staff, at, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institut, f, r, physik, to, hechingen, and, its, neighboring, town, of, haigerloch, on, the, edge, of, the, black, forest, for, the, same, reasons, from, 18, 26, october, he, travelled, to, german, occupied, netherlands, in, december, 1943, heisenberg, visited, german, occupied, poland, from, 24, january, to, 4, february, 1944, heisenberg, travelled, to, occupied, copenhagen, after, the, german, army, confiscated, bohr, s, institute, of, theoretical, physics, he, made, a, short, return, trip, in, april, in, december, heisenberg, lectured, in, neutral, switzerland, the, united, states, office, of, strategic, services, sent, agent, moe, berg, to, attend, the, lecture, carrying, a, pistol, with, orders, to, shoot, heisenberg, if, his, lecture, indicated, that, germany, was, close, to, completing, an, atomic, bomb, in, january, 1945, heisenberg, with, most, of, the, rest, of, his, staff, moved, from, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institut, f, r, physik, to, the, facilities, in, the, black, forest, the, alsos, mission, was, an, allied, effort, to, determine, if, the, germans, had, an, atomic, bomb, program, and, to, exploit, german, atomic, related, facilities, research, material, resources, and, scientific, personnel, for, the, benefit, of, the, us, personnel, on, this, operation, generally, swept, into, areas, which, had, just, come, under, control, of, the, allied, military, forces, but, sometimes, they, operated, in, areas, still, under, control, by, german, forces, berlin, had, been, a, location, of, many, german, scientific, research, facilities, to, limit, casualties, and, loss, of, equipment, many, of, these, facilities, were, dispersed, to, other, locations, in, the, latter, years, of, the, war, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institut, f, r, physik, kwip, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, had, been, bombed, so, it, had, mostly, been, moved, in, 1943, and, 1944, to, hechingen, and, its, neighbouring, town, of, haigerloch, on, the, edge, of, the, black, forest, which, eventually, became, included, in, the, french, occupation, zone, this, allowed, the, american, task, force, of, the, alsos, mission, to, take, into, custody, a, large, number, of, german, scientists, associated, with, nuclear, research, on, 30, march, the, alsos, mission, reached, heidelberg, where, important, scientists, were, captured, including, walther, bothe, richard, kuhn, philipp, lenard, and, wolfgang, gentner, their, interrogation, revealed, that, otto, hahn, was, at, his, laboratory, in, tailfingen, while, heisenberg, and, max, von, laue, were, at, heisenberg, s, laboratory, in, hechingen, and, that, the, experimental, natural, uranium, reactor, that, heisenberg, s, team, had, built, in, berlin, had, been, moved, to, haigerloch, thereafter, the, main, focus, of, the, alsos, mission, was, on, these, nuclear, facilities, in, the, w, rttemberg, area, heisenberg, was, smuggled, out, from, urfeld, on, 3, may, 1945, in, an, alpine, operation, in, territory, still, under, control, by, elite, german, forces, he, was, taken, to, heidelberg, where, on, 5, may, he, met, goudsmit, for, the, first, time, since, the, ann, arbor, visit, in, 1939, germany, surrendered, just, two, days, later, heisenberg, would, not, see, his, family, again, for, eight, months, as, he, was, moved, across, france, and, belgium, and, flown, to, england, on, 3, july, 1945, nine, of, the, prominent, german, scientists, who, published, reports, in, nuclear, physics, research, reports, as, members, of, the, uranverein, were, captured, by, operation, alsos, and, incarcerated, in, england, under, operation, epsilon, ten, german, scientists, including, heisenberg, were, held, at, farm, hall, in, england, the, facility, had, been, a, safe, house, of, the, british, foreign, intelligence, mi6, during, their, detention, their, conversations, were, recorded, conversations, thought, to, be, of, intelligence, value, were, transcribed, and, translated, into, english, the, transcripts, were, released, in, 1992, on, 6, august, 1945, the, scientists, at, farm, hall, learned, from, media, reports, that, the, us, had, dropped, an, atomic, bomb, in, hiroshima, japan, at, first, there, was, disbelief, that, a, bomb, had, been, built, and, dropped, in, the, weeks, that, followed, the, german, scientists, discussed, how, the, united, states, might, have, built, the, bomb, the, farm, hall, transcripts, reveal, that, heisenberg, along, with, other, physicists, interned, at, farm, hall, including, otto, hahn, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, were, glad, the, allies, had, won, world, war, ii, heisenberg, told, other, scientists, that, he, had, never, contemplated, a, bomb, only, an, atomic, pile, to, produce, energy, the, morality, of, creating, a, bomb, for, the, nazis, was, also, discussed, only, a, few, of, the, scientists, expressed, genuine, horror, at, the, prospect, of, nuclear, weapons, and, heisenberg, himself, was, cautious, in, discussing, the, matter, on, the, failure, of, the, german, nuclear, weapons, program, to, build, an, atomic, bomb, heisenberg, remarked, we, wouldn, t, have, had, the, moral, courage, to, recommend, to, the, government, in, the, spring, of, 1942, that, they, should, employ, 120, 000, men, just, for, building, the, thing, up, when, in, 1992, the, transcripts, were, declassified, german, physicist, manfred, popp, analyzed, the, transcripts, as, well, as, the, documentation, of, uranverein, when, the, german, scientists, heard, about, the, hiroshima, bomb, heisenberg, admitted, that, he, had, never, calculated, the, critical, mass, of, an, atomic, bomb, before, when, he, subsequently, attempted, to, calculate, the, mass, he, made, serious, calculation, errors, edward, teller, and, hans, bethe, saw, the, transcript, and, drew, the, conclusion, that, heisenberg, had, done, it, for, the, first, time, as, he, made, similar, errors, as, they, had, only, a, week, later, heisenberg, gave, a, lecture, about, the, physics, of, the, bomb, he, correctly, recognized, many, essential, aspects, including, the, efficiency, of, the, bomb, although, he, still, underestimated, it, for, popp, this, is, proof, that, heisenberg, did, not, spend, time, on, a, nuclear, weapon, during, the, war, on, the, contrary, he, avoided, even, thinking, about, it, on, 3, january, 1946, the, ten, operation, epsilon, detainees, were, transported, to, alswede, in, germany, heisenberg, settled, in, g, ttingen, which, was, in, the, british, zone, of, allied, occupied, germany, heisenberg, immediately, began, to, promote, scientific, research, in, germany, following, the, kaiser, wilhelm, society, s, dissolution, by, the, allied, control, council, and, the, establishment, of, the, max, planck, society, in, the, british, zone, heisenberg, became, the, director, of, the, max, planck, institute, for, physics, max, von, laue, was, appointed, vice, director, while, karl, wirtz, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, and, ludwig, biermann, joined, to, help, heisenberg, establish, the, institute, heinz, billing, joined, in, 1950, to, promote, the, development, of, electronic, computing, the, core, research, focus, of, the, institute, was, cosmic, radiation, the, institute, held, a, colloquium, every, saturday, morning, heisenberg, together, with, hermann, rein, was, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, forschungsrat, research, council, heisenberg, envisaged, this, council, to, promote, the, dialogue, between, the, newly, founded, federal, republic, of, germany, and, the, scientific, community, based, in, germany, heisenberg, was, appointed, president, of, the, forschungsrat, in, 1951, the, organization, was, fused, with, the, notgemeinschaft, der, deutschen, wissenschaft, emergency, association, of, german, science, and, that, same, year, renamed, the, deutsche, forschungsgemeinschaft, german, research, foundation, following, the, merger, heisenberg, was, appointed, to, the, presidium, in, 1958, the, max, planck, institut, f, r, physik, was, moved, to, munich, expanded, and, renamed, max, planck, institut, f, r, physik, und, astrophysik, mpifa, in, the, interim, heisenberg, and, the, astrophysicist, ludwig, biermann, were, co, directors, of, mpifa, heisenberg, also, became, an, ordentlicher, professor, ordinarius, professor, at, the, ludwig, maximilians, universit, t, m, nchen, heisenberg, was, the, sole, director, of, mpifa, from, 1960, to, 1970, heisenberg, resigned, his, directorship, of, the, mpifa, on, 31, december, 1970, in, 1951, heisenberg, agreed, to, become, the, scientific, representative, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, at, the, unesco, conference, with, the, aim, of, establishing, a, european, laboratory, for, nuclear, physics, heisenberg, s, aim, was, to, build, a, large, particle, accelerator, drawing, on, the, resources, and, technical, skills, of, scientists, across, the, western, bloc, on, 1, july, 1953, heisenberg, signed, the, convention, that, established, cern, on, behalf, of, the, federal, republic, of, germany, although, he, was, asked, to, become, cern, s, founding, scientific, director, he, declined, instead, he, was, appointed, chair, of, cern, s, science, policy, committee, and, went, on, to, determine, the, scientific, program, at, cern, in, december, 1953, heisenberg, became, the, president, of, the, alexander, von, humboldt, foundation, during, his, tenure, as, president, 550, humboldt, scholars, from, 78, nations, received, scientific, research, grants, heisenberg, resigned, as, president, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1946, the, german, scientist, heinz, pose, head, of, laboratory, v, in, obninsk, wrote, a, letter, to, heisenberg, inviting, him, to, work, in, the, ussr, the, letter, lauded, the, working, conditions, in, the, ussr, and, the, available, resources, as, well, as, the, favorable, attitude, of, the, soviets, towards, german, scientists, a, courier, hand, delivered, the, recruitment, letter, dated, 18, july, 1946, to, heisenberg, heisenberg, politely, declined, in, 1947, heisenberg, presented, lectures, in, cambridge, edinburgh, and, bristol, heisenberg, contributed, to, the, understanding, of, the, phenomenon, of, superconductivity, with, a, paper, in, 1947, and, two, papers, in, 1948, one, of, them, with, max, von, laue, in, the, period, shortly, after, world, war, ii, heisenberg, briefly, returned, to, the, subject, of, his, doctoral, thesis, turbulence, three, papers, were, published, in, 1948, and, one, in, 1950, in, the, post, war, period, heisenberg, continued, his, interests, in, cosmic, ray, showers, with, considerations, on, multiple, production, of, mesons, he, published, three, papers, in, 1949, two, in, 1952, and, one, in, 1955, in, late, 1955, to, early, 1956, heisenberg, gave, the, gifford, lectures, at, st, andrews, university, in, scotland, on, the, intellectual, history, of, physics, the, lectures, were, later, published, as, physics, and, philosophy, the, revolution, in, modern, science, during, 1956, and, 1957, heisenberg, was, the, chairman, of, the, arbeitskreis, kernphysik, nuclear, physics, working, group, of, the, fachkommission, ii, forschung, und, nachwuchs, commission, ii, research, and, growth, of, the, deutsche, atomkommission, datk, german, atomic, energy, commission, other, members, of, the, nuclear, physics, working, group, in, both, 1956, and, 1957, were, walther, bothe, hans, kopfermann, vice, chairman, fritz, bopp, wolfgang, gentner, otto, haxel, willibald, jentschke, heinz, maier, leibnitz, josef, mattauch, wolfgang, riezler, wilhelm, walcher, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, wolfgang, paul, was, also, a, member, of, the, group, during, 1957, in, 1957, heisenberg, was, a, signatory, of, the, g, ttinger, manifest, taking, a, public, stand, against, the, federal, republic, of, germany, arming, itself, with, nuclear, weapons, heisenberg, like, pascual, jordan, thought, politicians, would, ignore, this, statement, by, nuclear, scientists, but, heisenberg, believed, that, the, g, ttinger, manifest, would, influence, public, opinion, which, politicians, would, have, to, take, into, account, he, wrote, to, walther, gerlach, we, will, probably, have, to, keep, coming, back, to, this, question, in, public, for, a, long, time, because, of, the, danger, that, public, opinion, will, slacken, in, 1961, heisenberg, signed, the, memorandum, of, t, bingen, alongside, a, group, of, scientists, who, had, been, brought, together, by, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, and, ludwig, raiser, a, public, discussion, between, scientists, and, politicians, ensued, as, prominent, politicians, authors, and, socialites, joined, the, debate, on, nuclear, weapons, the, signatories, of, the, memorandum, took, a, stand, against, the, full, time, intellectual, nonconformists, from, 1957, onwards, heisenberg, was, interested, in, plasma, physics, and, the, process, of, nuclear, fusion, he, also, collaborated, with, the, international, institute, of, atomic, physics, in, geneva, he, was, a, member, of, the, institute, s, scientific, policy, committee, and, for, several, years, was, the, committee, s, chair, he, was, one, of, the, eight, signatories, of, the, memorandum, of, t, bingen, which, called, for, the, recognition, of, the, oder, nei, e, line, as, the, official, border, between, germany, and, poland, and, spoke, against, a, possible, nuclear, armament, of, west, germany, in, 1973, heisenberg, gave, a, lecture, at, harvard, university, on, the, historical, development, of, the, concepts, of, quantum, theory, on, 24, march, 1973, heisenberg, gave, a, speech, before, the, catholic, academy, of, bavaria, accepting, the, romano, guardini, prize, an, english, translation, of, his, speech, was, published, under, the, title, scientific, and, religious, truth, a, quotation, from, which, appears, in, a, later, section, of, this, article, heisenberg, admired, eastern, philosophy, and, saw, parallels, between, it, and, quantum, mechanics, describing, himself, as, in, complete, agreement, with, the, book, the, tao, of, physics, heisenberg, even, went, as, far, to, state, that, after, conversations, with, rabindranath, tagore, about, indian, philosophy, some, of, the, ideas, that, seemed, so, crazy, suddenly, made, much, more, sense, regarding, the, laws, of, nature, he, remarked, that, the, concept, of, the, law, of, nature, cannot, be, completely, objective, the, word, law, being, a, purely, human, principle, regarding, the, philosophy, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, heisenberg, disliked, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, but, he, liked, very, much, the, later, ideas, of, wittgenstein, and, his, philosophy, about, language, heisenberg, a, devout, christian, wrote, we, can, console, ourselves, that, the, good, lord, god, would, know, the, position, of, the, particles, thus, he, would, let, the, causality, principle, continue, to, have, validity, in, his, last, letter, to, albert, einstein, einstein, continued, to, maintain, that, quantum, physics, must, be, incomplete, because, it, implies, that, the, universe, is, indeterminate, at, a, fundamental, level, in, lectures, given, in, the, 1950s, and, later, published, as, physics, and, philosophy, heisenberg, contended, that, scientific, advances, were, leading, to, cultural, conflicts, he, stated, that, modern, physics, is, part, of, a, general, historical, process, that, tends, toward, a, unification, and, a, widening, of, our, present, world, when, heisenberg, accepted, the, romano, guardini, prize, in, 1974, he, gave, a, speech, which, he, later, published, under, the, title, scientific, and, religious, truth, he, mused, in, the, history, of, science, ever, since, the, famous, trial, of, galileo, it, has, repeatedly, been, claimed, that, scientific, truth, cannot, be, reconciled, with, the, religious, interpretation, of, the, world, although, i, am, now, convinced, that, scientific, truth, is, unassailable, in, its, own, field, i, have, never, found, it, possible, to, dismiss, the, content, of, religious, thinking, as, simply, part, of, an, outmoded, phase, in, the, consciousness, of, mankind, a, part, we, shall, have, to, give, up, from, now, on, thus, in, the, course, of, my, life, i, have, repeatedly, been, compelled, to, ponder, on, the, relationship, of, these, two, regions, of, thought, for, i, have, never, been, able, to, doubt, the, reality, of, that, to, which, they, point, heisenberg, referred, to, nature, as, god, s, second, book, the, first, being, the, bible, and, believed, that, physics, is, reflection, on, the, divine, ideas, of, creation, therefore, physics, is, divine, service, this, was, because, god, created, the, world, in, accordance, with, his, ideas, of, creation, and, humans, can, understand, the, world, because, man, was, created, as, the, spiritual, image, of, god, in, his, late, sixties, heisenberg, penned, his, autobiography, for, the, mass, market, in, 1969, the, book, was, published, in, germany, in, early, 1971, it, was, published, in, english, and, in, the, years, thereafter, in, a, string, of, other, languages, heisenberg, initiated, the, project, in, 1966, when, his, public, lectures, increasingly, turned, to, the, subjects, of, philosophy, and, religion, heisenberg, had, sent, the, manuscript, for, a, textbook, on, the, unified, field, theory, to, the, hirzel, verlag, and, john, wiley, sons, for, publication, this, manuscript, he, wrote, to, one, of, his, publishers, was, the, preparatory, work, for, his, autobiography, he, structured, his, autobiography, in, themes, covering, 1, the, goal, of, exact, science, 2, the, problematic, of, language, in, atomic, physics, 3, abstraction, in, mathematics, and, science, 4, the, divisibility, of, matter, or, kant, s, antinomy, 5, the, basic, symmetry, and, its, substantiation, and, 6, science, and, religion, heisenberg, wrote, his, memoirs, as, a, chain, of, conversations, covering, the, course, of, his, life, the, book, became, a, popular, success, but, was, regarded, as, troublesome, by, historians, of, science, in, the, preface, heisenberg, wrote, that, he, had, abridged, historical, events, to, make, them, more, concise, at, the, time, of, publication, it, was, reviewed, by, paul, forman, in, the, journal, science, with, the, comment, now, here, is, a, memoir, in, the, form, of, rationally, reconstructed, dialogue, and, the, dialogue, as, galileo, well, knew, is, itself, a, most, insidious, literary, device, lively, entertaining, and, especially, suited, for, insinuating, opinions, while, yet, evading, responsibility, for, them, few, scientific, memoirs, had, been, published, but, konrad, lorenz, and, adolf, portmann, had, penned, popular, books, that, conveyed, scholarship, to, a, wide, audience, heisenberg, worked, on, his, autobiography, and, published, it, with, the, piper, verlag, in, munich, heisenberg, initially, proposed, the, title, gespr, che, im, umkreis, der, atomphysik, conversations, on, atomic, physics, the, autobiography, was, published, eventually, under, the, title, der, teil, und, das, ganze, the, part, and, the, whole, the, 1971, english, translation, was, published, under, the, title, physics, and, beyond, encounters, and, conversations, heisenberg, died, of, kidney, cancer, at, his, home, on, 1, february, 1976, the, next, evening, his, colleagues, and, friends, walked, in, remembrance, from, the,
