with, his, father, s, standards, of, detachment, and, righteous, conduct, he, later, lost, interest, in, this, bread, winning, education, he, instead, became, proficient, in, making, images, acting, and, painting, when, he, was, fourteen, years, old, he, started, a, drama, group, with, some, of, his, friends, and, left, school, to, pursue, it, ramakrishna, had, practically, no, formal, education,

women, a, trader, durgadas, pyne, who, enforced, a, strict, purdah, on, the, women, in, his, household, criticised, those, who, would, meet, ramakrishna, to, listen, to, the, pur, as, ramakrishna, argued, with, him, that, women, will, be, protected, through, good, education, and, devotion, to, god, and, not, through, purdah, once, a, challenge, was, thrown, by, durgadas, that, it, was, impossible, to, look, into, his, inner, apartments, ramakrishna, accepted, the, challenge, and, dressed, himself, like, a, weaver, woman, then, fooled, durgadas, with, his, disguise, and, entered, the, inner, apartments, of, his, house, durgadas, defeated, allowed, the, women, to, go, and, listen, to, ramakrishna, s, recitals, ramakrishna, s, father, died, in, 1843, a, loss, which, he, felt, very, strongly, and, made, him, reticent, he, would, visit, the, nearby, cremation, ground, alone, to, practice, spiritual, disciplines, there, at, this, stage, the, family, responsibilities, fell, on, his, elder, brother, ramkumar, who, was, about, thirty, one, years, older, than, him, when, ramakrishna, was, in, his, teens, the, family, s, financial, position, worsened, ramkumar, then, started, a, sanskrit, school, in, calcutta, jhama, pukur, lane, whilst, also, serving, as, a, priest, there, in, 1852, ramakrishna, moved, to, calcutta, along, with, his, brother, to, assist, him, with, the, priestly, work, in, the, 19th, century, calcutta, there, lived, rani, rasmani, a, wealthy, woman, with, a, commanding, personality, a, widow, with, four, daughters, she, was, the, first, of, the, many, prominent, women, who, played, a, major, role, in, the, life, of, ramakrishna, inheriting, property, from, her, husband, the, rani, managed, to, endear, herself, to, the, people, of, the, city, through, her, exceptional, managerial, skills, of, the, estate, her, resistance, against, the, british, colonial, authorities, and, her, various, philanthropic, works, known, well, for, her, kindness, benevolence, to, the, poor, and, also, for, her, religious, devotion, she, was, much, loved, and, revered, by, the, people, and, proved, herself, to, be, worthy, of, the, title, rani, being, an, ardent, devotee, of, the, goddess, kali, the, rani, had, the, words, sri, rasmani, dasi, longing, for, the, feet, of, kali, inscribed, in, her, estates, official, seal, after, having, a, vision, of, the, goddess, kali, in, a, dream, on, the, night, before, her, departure, for, a, pilgrimage, to, the, hindu, holy, city, of, kashi, she, founded, the, now, famous, dakshineswar, kali, temple, reportedly, in, the, dream, the, goddess, instructed, her, that, instead, of, visiting, kashi, she, better, set, up, a, stone, idol, of, the, goddess, at, a, beautiful, place, on, the, banks, of, the, bhagirathi, river, and, make, arrangements, for, the, daily, worship, and, prasada, offering, there, then, she, would, manifest, in, the, deity, and, receive, her, worship, with, great, delight, the, rani, bought, a, large, piece, of, land, on, the, banks, of, hooghly, river, at, dakshineswar, and, started, the, construction, of, a, nine, spired, temple, where, pilgrims, could, congregate, to, catch, a, glimpse, of, the, goddess, however, for, being, born, into, a, c, si, kaivarta, family, she, was, deemed, unworthy, by, the, local, brahmins, to, make, food, offerings, to, kali, it, was, her, heart, s, desire, to, offer, prasada, to, kali, and, if, she, did, so, going, against, the, norms, of, the, brahmanical, society, of, the, time, the, devotees, would, no, longer, visit, that, temple, nor, would, a, brahmin, priest, officiate, there, to, find, a, scriptural, solution, to, her, problem, the, rani, sought, written, opinions, of, various, pandits, from, different, parts, of, the, country, however, none, of, the, opinions, were, in, her, favor, when, all, hope, was, seemingly, lost, she, received, a, letter, from, ramkumar, who, assured, her, that, the, scriptural, principles, would, be, observed, intact, if, she, made, a, gift, of, the, property, to, a, brahmin, who, could, then, install, the, deity, and, make, arrangements, for, food, offerings, no, blemish, would, then, be, incurred, by, those, who, partook, the, prasada, there, she, readily, agreed, to, these, conditions, displaying, savviness, in, working, around, the, rigidities, of, caste, while, adhering, to, its, restrictions, the, rani, thus, decided, to, consecrate, the, temple, and, proceeded, with, her, plans, while, the, search, for, a, priest, was, on, a, brahmin, named, mahesh, chandra, chattopadhyaya, who, worked, on, the, estate, of, the, rani, and, her, secretary, ramdhan, ghosh, both, of, whom, were, well, acquainted, with, ramkumar, requested, him, to, officiate, as, a, priest, at, the, temple, of, the, rani, albeit, temporarily, the, devout, ramkumar, agreed, and, later, after, the, opening, of, the, temple, on, the, last, day, of, may, in, 1855, on, request, by, the, rani, he, continued, as, its, chief, priest, ramkumar, informed, ramakrishna, that, he, was, taking, up, the, post, of, the, priest, and, asked, him, to, stay, at, the, kali, temple, at, this, injunction, ramakrishna, strenuously, objected, and, reminded, ramkumar, that, their, father, never, officiated, in, the, ceremonies, of, the, purported, lower, castes, and, refused, to, join, him, but, the, will, of, ramkumar, prevailed, in, this, matter, on, thursday, 31, may, 1855, ramkumar, in, the, presence, of, his, brother, ramakrishna, officiated, at, the, dedication, ceremony, of, the, dakshineswar, kali, temple, despite, having, brahmanical, authority, since, its, beginning, this, temple, remained, accessible, to, all, irrespective, of, caste, creed, and, class, within, three, months, after, the, consecration, of, the, temple, mathur, babu, the, rani, s, right, hand, man, was, much, impressed, by, ramakrishna, and, appointed, him, with, the, task, of, dressing, up, the, deity, of, kali, and, hriday, the, sixteen, year, old, nephew, of, ramakrishna, was, appointed, as, an, assistant, to, both, him, and, ramkumar, soon, ramkumar, began, to, teach, his, brother, the, modes, of, worship, and, service, of, the, goddess, in, the, hope, that, he, might, perform, them, in, his, absence, to, initiate, him, properly, a, sadhaka, of, shakti, named, kenaram, bhattacharya, was, invited, he, was, apparently, charmed, to, see, the, religious, fervor, in, ramakrishna, who, reportedly, became, ecstatic, as, soon, as, a, mantra, was, recited, in, his, ear, in, order, to, get, him, more, accustomed, ramkumar, later, employed, ramakrishna, on, few, occasions, to, perform, the, worship, of, kali, as, ramkumar, grew, old, and, infirm, to, carry, out, the, difficult, duties, at, the, kali, temple, mathur, with, the, permission, of, the, rani, requested, him, to, move, to, the, vishnu, temple, in, the, complex, for, conducting, worship, and, appointed, ramakrishna, to, the, office, of, priest, ramkumar, was, glad, with, this, arrangement, and, after, serving, for, one, year, since, the, consecration, of, the, temple, he, died, suddenly, in, 1856, while, preparing, to, go, home, on, a, leave, at, age, 20, ramakrishna, who, by, now, had, witnessed, more, than, one, death, in, his, family, realising, the, utter, impermanence, of, life, became, more, engrossed, in, the, worship, of, kali, after, the, daily, worship, he, would, sit, in, the, temple, looking, intently, at, the, deity, and, get, absorbed, in, her, before, losing, himself, in, devotion, whilst, singing, with, profound, emotion, the, songs, composed, by, devotees, like, ramprasad, and, kamalakanta, he, regarded, their, songs, as, an, aid, in, his, worship, and, was, certain, about, having, the, vision, of, kali, as, ramprasad, did, with, an, ardent, heart, he, would, say, thou, showed, thyself, to, ramprasad, mother, why, then, shouldst, thou, not, reveal, thyself, to, me, i, don, t, want, wealth, friends, relatives, enjoyment, of, pleasure, and, the, like, do, show, thyself, to, me, being, averse, to, wasting, any, time, after, the, closure, of, the, temple, during, midday, or, at, night, he, would, visit, the, nearby, jungle, to, think, and, meditate, on, kali, before, meditating, he, would, put, down, his, clothes, and, the, sacred, thread, aside, and, meditate, completely, naked, when, hriday, found, this, out, he, confronted, his, uncle, and, asked, him, to, explain, his, strange, conduct, ramakrishna, answered, that, when, one, thinks, about, god, one, should, be, free, from, all, attachments, and, the, eight, servitudes, of, hatred, fear, shame, aversion, egoism, vanity, noble, descent, and, good, conduct, he, viewed, his, sacred, thread, as, a, display, of, the, ego, of, his, brahmin, descent, and, thus, kept, it, aside, saying, when, calling, upon, the, mother, one, should, discard, all, such, bondages, and, call, on, her, with, a, focused, mind, he, assured, his, nephew, that, he, would, put, them, on, after, the, end, of, his, meditation, hriday, was, aghast, at, hearing, this, and, left, him, in, dismay, in, this, way, ramakrishna, spent, his, days, and, nights, altogether, in, prayer, singing, and, meditation, while, his, longing, for, her, vision, kept, increasing, daily, it, was, not, long, before, people, around, the, temple, started, noticing, his, passion, and, adherence, to, devotion, which, was, quite, unperturbed, by, the, opinions, of, people, around, him, the, rani, was, informed, by, her, son, in, law, mathur, thus, we, have, got, an, extraordinary, worshipper, the, goddess, will, be, awakened, very, soon, as, the, days, passed, ramakrishna, s, food, intake, and, sleep, gradually, declined, and, when, not, engaged, in, either, worship, or, meditation, he, was, seen, in, a, state, of, turmoil, over, whether, he, would, get, a, vision, of, the, mother, seeing, the, evening, sun, he, would, cry, mother, another, day, is, gone, and, still, i, have, not, seen, you, eventually, he, would, question, are, you, true, mother, or, is, it, all, a, fabrication, of, my, mind, mere, poetry, without, reality, if, you, do, exist, why, can, t, i, see, you, soon, his, longing, for, her, vision, became, extreme, and, he, was, engaged, in, either, worship, or, meditation, for, almost, twenty, four, hours, a, day, despaired, and, feeling, an, unbearable, pain, at, the, thought, that, he, might, never, have, her, vision, one, day, as, he, later, recounted, in, my, agony, i, said, to, myself, what, is, the, use, of, this, life, suddenly, my, eyes, fell, on, the, sword, that, hangs, in, the, temple, i, decided, to, end, my, life, with, it, then, and, there, like, a, madman, i, ran, to, it, and, seized, it, and, then, i, had, a, marvellous, vision, of, the, mother, and, fell, down, unconscious, he, became, overwhelmed, and, before, fainting, observed, that, to, his, spiritual, sight, houses, doors, temples, and, everything, else, around, vanishing, into, an, empty, void, and, what, i, saw, was, a, boundless, infinite, conscious, sea, of, light, however, far, and, in, whatever, direction, i, looked, i, found, a, continuous, succession, of, effulgent, waves, coming, forward, raging, and, storming, from, all, sides, with, great, speed, very, soon, they, fell, on, me, and, made, me, sink, to, the, unknown, bottom, i, panted, struggled, and, fell, unconscious, i, did, not, know, what, happened, then, in, the, external, world, how, that, day, and, the, next, slipped, away, but, in, my, heart, of, hearts, there, was, flowing, a, current, of, intense, bliss, never, experienced, before, and, i, had, the, immediate, knowledge, of, the, light, that, was, mother, when, he, regained, consciousness, he, was, found, uttering, the, word, maa, mother, repeatedly, in, an, aching, voice, thoroughly, convinced, of, kali, s, existence, ramakrishna, now, lived, at, her, abode, all, the, time, and, like, a, child, disinclined, to, leave, its, mother, so, was, he, disinclined, to, leave, his, divine, mother, kali, hovering, in, an, ocean, of, bliss, he, guided, various, seekers, to, kali, realising, one, cannot, experience, it, anywhere, but, from, her, when, asked, why, he, called, the, deity, a, mother, he, answered, that, it, was, because, the, child, is, most, free, with, the, mother, and, she, alone, can, cherish, the, child, more, than, anyone, else, people, around, him, noted, that, he, engaged, in, talks, of, spiritual, matters, only, and, never, about, any, worldly, issues, and, while, talking, about, kali, the, divine, mother, he, would, simply, cry, and, be, elated, when, someone, once, asked, him, about, kali, worship, he, said, i, do, not, worship, kali, made, of, clay, and, straw, my, mother, is, the, conscious, principle, my, mother, is, pure, satchidananda, existence, knowledge, bliss, absolute, that, which, is, infinite, and, deep, is, always, dark, coloured, the, extensive, sky, is, dark, coloured, and, so, is, the, deep, sea, my, kali, is, infinite, all, pervading, and, consciousness, itself, rumors, spread, to, kamarpukur, that, ramakrishna, became, unstable, as, a, result, of, his, spiritual, practices, at, dakshineswar, ramakrishna, s, mother, and, his, elder, brother, rameswar, decided, to, get, ramakrishna, married, thinking, that, marriage, would, be, a, good, steadying, influence, upon, him, by, forcing, him, to, take, up, responsibilities, and, keep, his, attention, on, normal, affairs, rather, than, on, his, spiritual, practices, and, visions, ramakrishna, himself, mentioned, that, they, would, find, the, bride, at, the, house, of, ramchandra, mukherjee, in, jayrambati, three, miles, to, the, north, west, of, kamarpukur, the, five, year, old, bride, saradamani, mukhopadhyaya, later, known, as, sarada, devi, she, is, also, considered, an, avatar, was, found, and, the, marriage, was, duly, solemnised, in, 1859, ramakrishna, was, twenty, three, at, this, point, but, this, age, difference, for, marriage, was, typical, for, nineteenth, century, rural, bengal, they, later, spent, three, months, together, in, kamarpukur, when, sarada, devi, was, fourteen, and, ramakrishna, thirty, two, ramakrishna, became, a, very, influential, figure, in, sarada, s, life, and, she, became, a, strong, follower, of, his, teachings, after, the, marriage, sarada, stayed, at, jayrambati, and, joined, ramakrishna, in, dakshineswar, at, the, age, of, eighteen, by, the, time, his, bride, joined, him, ramakrishna, had, already, embraced, the, monastic, life, of, a, sannyasi, and, the, marriage, was, never, consummated, once, as, a, part, of, practicing, the, spiritual, mood, called, m, dhur, bhav, s, dhana, ramakrishna, dressed, and, behaved, as, a, woman, disciple, mahendranath, gupta, quoted, the, master, as, follows, how, can, a, man, conquer, passion, he, should, assume, the, attitude, of, a, woman, i, spent, many, days, as, the, handmaid, of, god, i, dressed, myself, in, women, s, clothes, put, on, ornaments, and, covered, the, upper, part, of, my, body, with, a, scarf, just, like, a, woman, with, the, scarf, on, i, used, to, perform, the, evening, worship, before, the, image, otherwise, how, could, i, have, kept, my, wife, with, me, for, eight, months, both, of, us, behaved, as, if, we, were, the, handmaid, of, the, divine, mother, as, a, priest, ramakrishna, performed, the, ritual, ceremony, of, the, shodashi, puja, in, his, room, where, he, worshipped, his, wife, sarada, devi, as, the, divine, mother, herself, ramakrishna, regarded, sarada, devi, as, the, divine, mother, in, person, addressing, her, as, the, holy, mother, and, it, was, by, this, name, that, she, became, known, to, ramakrishna, s, disciples, sarada, devi, outlived, ramakrishna, by, thirty, four, years, and, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, nascent, religious, movement, in, 1860, ramakrishna, returned, to, dakshineswar, and, was, again, caught, up, in, a, spiritual, tempest, forgetting, his, wife, home, body, and, surroundings, he, once, described, his, experiences, during, this, most, tumultuous, period, of, his, life, thus, no, sooner, had, i, passed, through, one, spiritual, crisis, than, another, took, its, place, it, was, like, being, in, the, midst, of, a, whirlwind, even, my, sacred, thread, was, blown, away, i, could, seldom, keep, hold, of, my, dhoti, sometimes, i, would, open, my, mouth, and, it, would, be, as,

and, i, lost, consciousness, sometimes, i, would, share, my, food, with, a, dog, my, hair, became, matted, birds, would, perch, on, my, head, and, peck, at, the, grains, of, rice, which, had, lodged, there, during, the, worship, snakes, would, crawl, over, my, motionless, body, an, ordinary, man, couldn, t, have, borne, a, quarter, of, that, tremendous, fervour, it, would, have, burnt, him, up, i, had, no, sleep, at, all, for, six, long, years, my, eyes, lost, the, power, of, winking, i, stood, in, front, of, a, mirror, and, tried, to, close, my, eyelids, with, my, finger, and, i, couldn, t, i, got, frightened, and, said, to, mother, mother, is, this, what, happens, to, those, who, call, on, you, i, surrendered, myself, to, you, and, you, gave, me, this, terrible, disease, i, used, to, shed, tears, but, then, suddenly, i, d, be, filled, with, ecstasy, i, saw, that, my, body, didn, t, matter, it, was, of, no, importance, a, mere, trifle, mother, appeared, to, me, and, comforted, me, and,

practices, called, vamachara, left, hand, path, which, utilise, as, a, means, of, liberation, activities, like, eating, of, parched, grain, fish, and, meat, along, with, drinking, of, wine, and, sexual, intercourse, according, to, ramakrishna, and, his, biographers, ramakrishna, did, not, directly, participate, in, the, last, two, of, those, activities, some, even, say, he, didn, t, indulge, in, meat, eating, all, that, he, needed, was, a, suggestion, of, them, to, produce, the, desired, result, ramakrishna, acknowledged, the, left, hand, tantric, path, though, it, had, undesirable, features, as, one, of, the, valid, roads, to, god, realization, he, consistently, cautioned, his, devotees, and, disciples, against, associating, with, it, the, bhairavi, also, taught, ramakrishna,

vision, of, two, young, boys, merging, into, his, body, while, he, was, crossing, the, river, in, a, boat, earlier, after, his, vision, of, kali, he, is, said, to, have, cultivated, the, santa, bhava, the, child, attitude, towards, kali, towards, the, end, of, 1864, an, itinerant, monk, named, tota, puri, a, tall, naked, mendicant, with, tangled, hair, a, naga, sadhu, of, mahanirvani, akhara, born, probably, in, punjab, arrived, at, dakshineswar, while, on, a, pilgrimage, through, various, holy, sites, in, india, he, was, the, head, of, a, monastery, and, claimed, leadership, over, seven, hundred, sannyasis, these, sannyasis, are, renowned, to, be, the, knowers, of, brahman, and, as, beings, who, are, thoroughly, satisfied, in, themselves, they, see, the, whole, universe, as, brahman, and, its, manifestation, through, maya, they, are, always, on, move, traveling, to, different, pilgrimage, places, visiting, various, temples, and, meeting, holy, people, in, order, to, experience, brahman, there, tota, puri, was, one, such, man, who, was, on, a, similar, visit, when, he, arrived, at, dakshineswar, it, was, a, traditional, convention, with, him, to, not, spend, more, than, three, days, at, any, one, place, and, arrived, at, the, kali, temple, expecting, to, spend, only, three, days, there, arriving, at, the, temple, ghat, tota, puri, had, a, glimpse, of, the, devotional, face, of, ramakrishna, and, stepped, up, to, him, wondering, if, he, can, be, a, fit, aspirant, for, learning, vedanta, in, bengal, a, province, which, was, then, saturated, with, tantra, after, observing, ramakrishna, rigorously, he, asked, him, on, his, own, volition, if, he, was, interested, in, practicing, any, vedantic, disciplines, ramakrishna, replied, i, know, nothing, of, what, i, should, do, or, not, my, mother, knows, everything, i, shall, do, as, she, commands, a, startled, tota, told, him, to, go, ask, your, mother, then, at, which, ramakrishna, silently, went, into, the, temple, and, returned, ecstatically, with, a, joyful, face, and, informed, that, his, mother, said, go, and, learn, it, is, in, order, to, teach, you, that, the, monk, came, here, being, aware, that, whom, ramakrishna, was, referring, to, as, his, mother, was, the, idol, in, the, temple, tota, though, fascinated, at, this, childlike, simplicity, opined, his, behaviour, was, due, to, ignorance, and, false, beliefs, being, a, learned, man, and, of, sharp, intellect, tota, had, no, regard, for, any, deity, except, for, the, ishvara, of, vedanta, he, looked, upon, the, devi, as, a, delusional, figure, and, had, no, belief, in, her, existence, much, less, worshipping, or, propitiating, her, however, he, did, not, say, anything, about, this, to, ramakrishna, as, he, felt, his, impressions, of, mind, would, anyway, pass, away, once, initiated, into, sannyasa, at, the, panchavati, situated, to, the, north, of, the, temple, garden, ramakrishna, was, initiated, into, sannyasa, by, tota, puri, at, the, dawn, of, morning, in, the, auspicious, moment, of, brahmamuhurtha, with, the, homa, fire, lighted, he, was, guided, through, the, various, rites, and, ceremonies, involved, in, the, procedure, of, becoming, a, sannyasi, in, accordance, with, the, scriptural, injunctions, and, tradition, of, successive, generations, he, offered, as, an, oblation, to, be, free, from, the, desire, of, having, spouse, children, wealth, admiration, from, people, beautiful, body, and, so, on, and, renounced, them, all, he, then, also, offered, his, sacred, thread, and, the, tuft, of, hair, on, his, head, as, part, of, the, oblation, a, pair, of, kaupinas, cloth, covering, worn, over, the, privities, and, an, ochre, cloth, were, then, presented, by, the, guru, tota, to, the, sadhaka, ramakrishna, who, was, then, instructed, by, tota, thus, brahman, the, one, substance, which, alone, is, eternally, pure, eternally, awakened, unlimited, by, time, space, and, causation, is, absolutely, real, through, maya, which, makes, the, impossible, possible, it, causes, by, virtue, of, its, influence, to, seem, that, it, is, divided, into, names, and, forms, brahman, is, never, really, so, divided, for, at, the, time, of, samadhi, not, even, a, drop, so, to, say, of, time, and, space, and, name, and, form, produced, by, maya, is, perceived, whatever, therefore, is, within, the, bounds, of, name, and, form, can, never, be, absolutely, real, shun, it, by, a, good, distance, break, the, firm, cage, of, name, and, form, with, the, overpowering, strength, of, a, lion, and, come, out, of, it, dive, deep, into, the, reality, of, the, self, existing, in, yourself, be, one, with, it, with, the, help, of, samadhi, you, will, then, see, the, universe, consisting, of, name, and, form, vanish, as, it, were, into, the, void, you, will, see, the, consciousness, of, the, little, i, merge, in, that, of, the, immense, i, where, it, ceases, to, function, and, you, will, have, the, immediate, knowledge, of, the, indivisible, existence, knowledge, bliss, as, yourself, quoting, scriptures, tota, explained, to, his, disciple, the, need, to, attain, the, non, dual, consciousness, as, it, alone, can, provide, a, person, the, supreme, bliss, he, tried, to, enable, his, disciple, to, experience, the, gains, from, his, lifelong, sadhana, right, on, that, day, and, attempted, to, make, him, attain, samadhi, he, asked, his, disciple, to, free, his, mind, from, all, functions, and, merge, it, in, the, meditation, of, the, self, it, so, came, to, pass, that, when, ramakrishna, sat, for, meditation, he, could, by, no, means, make, his, mind, stop, from, functioning, he, would, withdraw, his, mind, easily, from, everything, but, as, soon, as, he, did, so, the, intimately, familiar, form, of, the, divine, mother, made, up, of, pure, consciousness, would, appear, before, him, as, a, living, and, moving, being, making, him, unmindful, of, renunciation, every, time, he, sat, for, meditation, this, happened, all, over, again, and, becoming, nearly, hopeless, he, said, to, his, guru, no, it, cannot, be, done, i, cannot, make, the, mind, free, from, functioning, and, force, it, to, dive, into, the, self, criticizing, his, disciple, very, harshly, for, his, defiance, tota, now, feverishly, went, about, searching, in, the, hut, after, finding, a, broken, piece, of, glass, he, took, it, into, his, hand, and, forcibly, pierced, its, needlelike, pointed, end, on, his, disciple, s, forehead, between, the, eyebrows, and, said, collect, the, mind, here, to, this, point, with, a, firm, determination, ramakrishna, now, determined, sat, for, meditation, and, when, as, previously, the, form, of, the, divine, mother, appeared, before, his, mind, he, immediately, cut, her, mentally, into, two, with, the, sword, of, knowledge, according, to, ramakrishna, there, remained, then, no, function, in, the, mind, which, transcended, quickly, the, realm, of, names, and, forms, making, me, merge, in, samadhi, after, being, around, for, a, long, time, near, his, disciple, who, s, now, merged, into, samadhi, tota, came, out, of, the, hut, and, locked, its, door, lest, someone, may, enter, taking, his, seat, outside, under, the, panchavati, he, awaited, a, call, to, open, the, door, days, passed, by, and, nights, rolled, on, and, at, the, end, of, three, days, when, there, was, no, call, surprised, and, curious, he, entered, the, hut, and, found, ramakrishna, sitting, in, the, exact, same, posture, in, which, he, left, him, with, no, sign, of, breath, whatsoever, and, face, calm, and, radiant, highly, versed, in, the, phenomena, of, samadhi, tota, was, astonished, and, thought, is, it, indeed, true, what, i, see, enacted, before, me, has, this, great, soul, actually, realized, in, a, day, what, i, could, experience, only, as, the, fruit, of, forty, years, of, austere, sadhana, in, disbelief, he, now, began, to, examine, and, inspect, in, detail, all, the, signs, manifested, in, the, body, of, ramakrishna, he, particularly, examined, if, his, heart, was, beating, and, whether, there, was, the, smallest, amount, of, breath, coming, out, through, his, nostrils, he, touched, and, checked, his, body, which, was, now, in, a, firm, posture, like, a, piece, of, fixed, wood, seeing, no, signs, of, change, nor, any, return, of, normal, consciousness, tota, brimming, with, joy, and, awe, exclaimed, is, it, in, truth, samadhi, is, it, the, nirvikalpa, samadhi, the, ultimate, result, attained, through, the, path, of, knowledge, spoken, of, in, the, vedanta, ah, how, very, strange, is, the, maya, of, the, divine, he, then, began, the, process, of, bringing, back, his, disciple, to, normal, consciousness, by, chanting, out, loud, the, mantra, hari, aum, the, sound, of, which, reverberated, the, entire, space, around, panchavati, after, the, experience, of, nirvikalpa, samadhi, ramakrishna, realized, that, the, great, weaver, of, maya, is, none, other, than, kali, the, divine, mother, herself, that, she, projects, it, by, her, will, like, a, spider, that, spins, a, web, out, of, itself, and, she, can, no, more, be, differentiated, from, brahman, than, can, the, power, of, burning, from, fire, observing, maya, as, a, majestic, and, enigmatic, statement, of, divinity, he, was, filled, with, reverence, and, love, for, it, unlike, with, disdain, seen, in, other, realised, souls, he, observed, that, maya, functions, in, the, world, in, two, ways, and, named, them, as, avidya, maya, and, vidya, maya, considering, avidya, maya, to, be, represented, by, the, lower, forces, like, evil, greed, cruelty, etc, which, consign, a, man, to, the, lower, level, of, existence, and, vidya, maya, to, be, represented, by, the, higher, forces, like, kindness, love, and, devotion, which, elevate, a, man, to, the, higher, levels, of, existence, ramakrishna, felt, that, when, an, individual, with, the, help, of, vidya, maya, could, rid, himself, of, avidya, maya, he, would, become, mayatita, or, free, of, maya, he, realised, these, two, facets, of, maya, to, be, the, two, forces, of, creation, the, two, powers, of, kali, who, stands, beyond, both, of, them, like, the, beaming, sun, behind, the, clouds, of, different, colours, and, patterns, and, shines, through, them, all, instead, of, looking, upon, the, world, as, an, illusion, created, by, brahman, as, per, vedanta, ramakrishna, looked, upon, it, as, the, manifestation, of, the, divine, mother, he, further, elaborated, his, view, on, the, brahman, of, vedanta, and, the, divine, mother, of, tantra, thus, when, i, think, of, the, supreme, being, as, inactive, neither, creating, nor, preserving, nor, destroying, i, call, him, brahman, or, purusha, the, impersonal, god, when, i, think, of, him, as, active, creating, preserving, and, destroying, i, call, him, sakti, or, maya, or, prakriti, the, personal, god, but, the, distinction, between, them, does, not, mean, a, difference, the, personal, and, the, impersonal, are, the, same, thing, like, milk, and, its, whiteness, the, diamond, and, its, lustre, the, snake, and, its, wriggling, motion, it, is, impossible, to, conceive, of, the, one, without, the, other, the, divine, mother, and, brahman, are, one, having, seen, the, rapid, progress, of, ramakrishna, in, the, vedantic, path, tota, puri, now, started, to, have, many, serious, discussions, with, him, over, devotion, to, the, divine, mother, and, the, vedantic, brahman, during, the, course, of, one, such, lively, discussion, a, servant, of, the, temple, garden, visited, them, and, took, a, piece, of, charcoal, from, the, pit, of, the, sacred, dhuni, fire, which, was, then, lit, by, the, great, ascetic, himself, to, light, his, own, tobacco, at, this, instance, of, the, unholy, act, by, the, servant, tota, flew, into, rage, and, began, to, threaten, the, man, severely, ramakrishna, who, was, sitting, aside, and, seeing, all, this, fell, onto, the, ground, rolling, in, laughter, and, remarked, how, powerful, the, influence, of, maya, is, over, the, behaviour, of, tota, who, was, until, then, talking, about, how, all, people, are, manifestations, of, brahman, but, forgot, everything, and, got, angry, at, that, servant, tota, feeling, embarrassed, vowed, never, to, be, angry, again, ramakrishna, would, go, on, to, say, caught, in, the, net, of, five, elements, brahman, weeps, and, that, no, amount, of, self, knowledge, will, make, the, life, of, a, man, better, until, the, grace, of, god, is, bestowed, on, him, through, the, power, of, maya, after, staying, in, the, bengal, province, for, a, while, tota, puri, who, until, then, had, never, had, any, illness, in, his, life, caught, dysentery, which, made, his, life, quite, miserable, thinking, about, taking, his, leave, and, moving, away, he, approached, ramakrishna, but, every, time, he, did, so, he, would, either, forget, to, mention, it, or, would, feel, prevented, from, speaking, about, it, by, someone, within, him, and, then, would, go, back, hesitantly, seeing, his, frail, body, and, knowing, about, his, condition, ramakrishna, with, help, of, mathur, arranged, for, a, special, diet, and, medicines, all, to, no, avail, being, well, versed, in, meditation, tota, puri, used, to, merge, his, mind, into, samadhi, at, will, and, thus, avoid, feeling, the, pain, in, his, body, however, on, one, night, the, pain, in, his, intestines, became, so, intense, that, his, mind, was, no, longer, able, to, merge, in, samadhi, and, he, decided, to, drown, his, cage, of, bones, and, flesh, in, the, river, ganga, and, be, free, from, the, consciousness, of, having, body, he, thus, set, out, and, on, reaching, a, bank, of, the, river, started, walking, into, it, and, kept, walking, further, all, the, way, to, almost, the, other, side, of, the, bank, baffled, that, there, seemed, to, be, not, enough, water, in, the, river, to, drown, himself, he, looked, back, and, found, in, one, dazzling, vision, the, sight, of, the, divine, mother, the, one, beyond, turiya, filling, up, all, the, space, round, him, feeling, awe, and, realising, that, the, brahman, he, had, been, worshipping, all, his, life, was, none, other, than, the, divine, mother, herself, with, a, grateful, heart, he, turned, back, and, spent, the, remaining, night, meditating, on, the, divine, mother, near, the, dhuni, under, panchavati, when, ramakrishna, met, tota, in, the, morning, to, enquire, about, his, health, he, was, found, a, totally, different, person, with, no, more, illness, reflecting, on, how, imprudent, he, was, to, not, accept, the, divine, mother, tota, explained, to, him, the, events, that, transpired, the, night, before, and, that, by, the, grace, of, the, mother, he, was, now, free, from, his, disease, ramakrishna, with, a, smile, said, well, you, did, not, accept, the, mother, before, and, argued, with, me, saying, that, shakti, was, unreal, but, you, have, now, seen, her, yourself, and, direct, experience, has, got, the, better, of, your, arguments, she, has, convinced, me, already, of, the, fact, that, just, as, fire, and, its, burning, power, are, not, different, so, brahman, and, the, power, of, brahman, are, not, different, but, one, and, the, same, tota, then, asked, ramakrishna, to, exhort, her, to, give, him, permission, to, leave, as, he, now, realised, that, it, was, her, will, that, he, who, had, never, spent, more, than, three, days, at, a, place, had, spent, eleven, months, there, both, of, them, then, visited, the, temple, and, tota, who, until, then, considered, the, image, of, the, devi, to, be, a, delusion, prostrated, himself, in, front, of, her, idol, along, with, ramakrishna, a, few, days, later, he, took, leave, and, left, dakshineswar, it, was, his, first, and, the, last, visit, to, that, place, some, time, after, the, departure, of, tota, puri, from, dakshineswar, ramakrishna, owing, to, his, lack, of, any, restraining, elements, or, desires, in, the, world, decided, to, dwell, in, the, plane, of, nirvikalpa, samadhi, as, he, attempted, to, do, so, once, again, the, form, of, the, divine, mother, beautiful, more, beautiful, than, the, most, started, to, appear, in, front, of, his, mind, and, he, not, having, the, heart, to, leave, her, behind, and, go, ahead, would, return, after, much, internal, deliberation, with, great, courage, ramakrishna, again, while, meditating, took, up, knowledge, as, the, sword, and, cut, her, form, into, two, and, then, there, was, nothing, left, in, the, mind, then, and, it, rushed, quickly, up, to, the, complete, nirvikalapa, state, ramakrishna, remained, in, the, nirvikalapa, state, continually, for, a, period, of, six, months, a, state, of, perception, said, to, be, from, which, no, ordinary, person, returns, back, as, the, body, would, then, fall, dead, after, twenty, one, days, like, a, dry, leaf, from, a, tree, he, remained, unconscious, of, the, outer, world, throughout, this, period, and, stayed, put, like, a, dead, man, with, matted, hair, and, flies, moving, through, his, mouth, and, nostrils, he, might, have, passed, away, then, if, not, for, the, untiring, efforts, of, an, unknown, monk, who, happened, to, be, present, in, dakshineswar, at, the, time, and, who, on, recognising, the, state, in, which, ramakrishna, was, thought, his, body, must, be, kept, alive, for, the, betterment, of, the, world, as, the, work, of, the, mother, is, still, to, be, done, with, it, and, made, attempts, every, day, to, bring, it, back, to, awareness, by, beating, him, with, a, stick, and, feed, him, in, the, resulting, fleeting, moments, of, consciousness, which, though, appeared, very, rarely, for, a, few, moments, on, some, days, this, period, of, being, in, the, nirvikalapa, state, came, to, an, end, after, ramakrishna, received, a, command, from, the, mother, to, remain, in, bhava, mukha, a, state, of, consciousness, bordering, between, being, absorbed, into, the, absolute, and, remaining, in, the, relative, world, for, the, sake, of, enlightening, people, this, was, followed, by, him, having, an, affliction, with, a, severe, bout, of, dysentery, after, suffering, intense, pain, in, the, intestines, continually, for, about, six, months, his, mind, gradually, returned, to, the, normal, plane, of, consciousness, before, that, it, used, to, rise, and, be, fixated, at, the, nirvikalpa, state, every, now, and, then, ramakrishna, then, firmed, his, awareness, at, the, sixth, chakra, of, tantra, and, lived, with, his, consciousness, oscillating, between, being, either, absorbed, into, the, impersonal, absolute, or, remain, in, personal, devotion, to, the, mother, later, in, his, life, it, was, observed, that, while, talking, about, or, listening, to, subjects, related, to, god, ramakrishna, with, his, face, beaming, a, smile, and, body, turning, radiant, would, become, noticeably, stiff, and, unconscious, when, one, of, his, disciples, asked, him, why, does, it, happen, so, and, what, does, he, experience, in, that, state, ramakrishna, smiled, and, replied, well, it, is, called, samadhi, the, culmination, of, meditation, i, borrow, one, sixteenth, part, of, the, mind, from, the, divine, mother, and, talk, and, laugh, with, you, but, the, remaining, portion, rests, with, the, mother, meditating, on, her, real, essence, as, existence, knowledge, bliss, absolute, when, i, talk, or, hear, about, the, mother, the, whole, mind, goes, to, the, absolute, and, samadhi, immediately, ensues, do, you, know, what, samadhi, really, is, it, is, complete, absorption, in, brahman, do, you, know, how, i, feel, at, that, time, suppose, there, is, a, basin, of, water, on, the, seashore, and, a, fish, is, confined, in, it, if, the, basin, is, accidentally, broken, the, fish, finds, its, way, to, the, unfathomable, ocean, it, then, frolics, in, the, height, of, joy, doesn, t, it, similarly, during, samadhi, my, mind, leaps, out, of, this, body, as, it, were, and, plunges, into, existence, knowledge, bliss, absolute, hence, the, body, appears, like, that, in, other, words, there, is, no, body, consciousness, and, the, soul, merges, in, the, higher, self, the, paramatman, in, the, thousand, petalled, lotus, of, the, head, and, experiences, unspeakable, bliss, that, experience, sends, a, wave, of, divine, bliss, to, the, face, and, the, body, becomes, radiant, this, very, self, then, becomes, shiva, the, absolute, the, periods, of, samadhi, would, later, become, a, regular, part, in, the, life, of, ramakrishna, and, people, near, him, used, to, find, him, in, a, state, of, samadhi, every, now, and, then, sometimes, for, almost, twenty, four, hours, a, day, once, a, government, official, found, him, remaining, in, a, state, of, ecstasy, for, three, days, and, three, nights, straight, when, found, deeply, absorbed, in, samadhi, for, a, long, period, of, time, his, devotees, would, rub, cow, ghee, on, his, spine, from, neck, to, the, lower, back, and, on, knees, down, to, the, soles, of, his, feet, pulling, in, a, downward, direction, so, as, to, bring, him, back, to, the, plane, of, normal, consciousness, ramakrishna, used, to, say, the, natural, tendency, of, his, mind, is, towards, the, nirvikalpa, plane, and, once, in, samadhi, he, would, not, be, inclined, to, come, back, to, the, normal, plane, of, consciousness, but, would, return, for, the, sake, of, his, devotees, and, sometimes, even, this, will, was, not, enough, so, he, would, fill, his, mind, with, trivial, desires, like, i, will, smoke, tobacco, i, will, drink, water, i, will, take, this, i, will, see, so, and, so, i, will, talk, and, by, repeatedly, saying, such, things, to, his, mind, he, would, make, it, gradually, return, to, the, plane, of, body, consciousness, he, would, later, often, tell, his, devotees, to, tie, the, knowledge, of, non, duality, in, the, corner, of, your, cloth, and, then, do, whatever, you, want, in, 1866, govinda, roy, a, hindu, man, who, was, previously, initiated, into, islam, and, practised, sufism, initiated, ramakrishna, into, islam, ramakrishna, learned, about, govinda, through, the, latter, s, regular, visits, to, dakshineswar, being, much, impressed, by, seeing, the, faith, and, love, for, god, in, govinda, ramakrishna, decided, to, practice, islam, reasoning, this, also, is, a, path, to, realisation, of, god, the, sportive, mother, the, source, of, infinite, lila, has, been, blessing, many, people, with, the, attainment, of, her, lotus, feet, through, this, path, also, i, must, see, how, through, it, she, makes, those, who, take, refuge, in, her, attain, their, desired, end, ramakrishna, engaged, himself, in, the, practice, of, islam, according, to, its, prescribed, rules, he, devotedly, repeated, the, name, of, allah, and, said, their, prayers, five, times, a, day, and, remained, in, that, state, of, mind, for, three, days, after, which, he, had, full, realisation, through, their, path, during, this, practice, ramakrishna, had, a, vision, of, a, luminous, figure, and, swami, nikhilananda, s, biography, speculates, that, the, figure, was, perhaps, mohammed, according, to, these, accounts, ramakrishna, devoutly, repeated, the, name, of, allah, wore, a, cloth, like, the, arab, muslims, said, their, prayer, five, times, daily, and, felt, disinclined, even, to, see, images, of, the, hindu, gods, and, goddesses, much, less, worship, them, for, the, hindu, way, of, thinking, had, disappeared, altogether, from, my, mind, after, three, days, of, practice, he, had, a, vision, of, a, radiant, personage, with, grave, countenance, and, white, beard, resembling, the, prophet, and, merging, with, his, body, he, opined, this, vision, to, be, of, the, all, pervasive, brahman, with, attributes, as, the, vision, eventually, ended, with, him, merging, into, the, attributeless, absolute, brahman, kripal, writes, that, this, would, have, been, a, heretical, experience, through, and, through, for, most, muslims, after, his, experience, of, practicing, islam, ramakrishna, opined, that, knowledge, of, vedanta, can, make, hindus, and, muslims, sympathetic, to, one, another, as, there, is, as, it, were, a, mountain, of, difference, between, them, their, thoughts, and, faiths, actions, and, behaviour, have, remained, quite, unintelligible, to, one, another, in, spite, of, their, living, together, for, so, long, a, time, at, the, end, of, 1873, ramakrishna, started, the, practice, of, christianity, after, one, of, his, devotees, named, sambhu, chandra, mallick, read, the, bible, to, him, he, got, well, acquainted, with, the, life, and, teachings, of, jesus, once, when, the, bible, was, being, read, out, loud, to, him, from, the, very, beginning, there, were, references, to, the, doctrine, of, sin, after, hearing, a, little, and, finding, that, it, talked, of, nothing, but, sin, he, refused, to, listen, to, it, anymore, further, saying, just, as, in, the, case, of, snakebite, if, the, patient, can, be, made, to, believe, that, there, is, no, poison, at, all, he, will, be, all, right, similarly, if, one, constantly, thinks, i, have, taken, the, name, of, the, lord, so, i, am, sinless, one, becomes, pure, he, ideated, that, the, more, we, give, up, such, ideas, as, i, am, sinful, i, am, weak, the, better, it, will, be, for, all, as, we, all, are, children, of, god, thus, not, weak, and, sinful, he, considered, thinking, of, oneself, as, weak, and, sinful, to, be, the, greatest, sin, in, 1874, ramakrishna, experienced, a, strange, vision, at, the, parlour, of, jadu, mallik, s, garden, house, situated, to, the, south, of, kali, temple, in, dakshineswar, he, was, sitting, there, and, looking, keenly, at, a, picture, of, madonna, and, child, hanging, on, the, wall, when, all, of, a, sudden, he, saw, it, come, to, life, with, effulgent, rays, of, light, emerging, from, the, image, and, merging, into, his, heart, a, few, days, later, while, walking, in, the, panchavati, he, reportedly, had, a, vision, of, jesus, coming, towards, him, embracing, and, merging, into, his, body, at, this, moment, he, reportedly, lost, his, normal, consciousness, entered, into, trance, and, remained, for, some, time, identified, with, the, all, pervasive, brahman, with, attributes, in, his, own, room, amongst, other, divine, pictures, was, one, of, christ, and, he, burnt, incense, before, it, morning, and, evening, there, was, also, a, picture, showing, jesus, christ, saving, st, peter, from, drowning, in, the, water, in, 1875, ramakrishna, met, the, influential, brahmo, samaj, leader, keshab, chandra, sen, keshab, had, accepted, christianity, and, had, separated, from, the, adi, brahmo, samaj, formerly, keshab, had, rejected, idolatry, but, under, the, influence, of, ramakrishna, he, accepted, hindu, polytheism, and, established, the, new, dispensation, nava, vidhan, religious, movement, based, on, ramakrishna, s, principles, worship, of, god, as, mother, all, religions, as, true, and, assimilation, of, hindu, polytheism, into, brahmoism, keshab, also, publicised, ramakrishna, s, teachings, in, the, journals, of, new, dispensation, over, a, period, of, several, years, which, was, instrumental, in, bringing, ramakrishna, to, the, attention, of, a, wider, audience, especially, the, bhadralok, english, educated, classes, of, bengal, and, the, europeans, residing, in, india, following, keshab, other, brahmos, such, as, vijaykrishna, goswami, started, to, admire, ramakrishna, propagate, his, ideals, and, reorient, their, socio, religious, outlook, many, prominent, people, of, kolkata, pratap, chandra, mazumdar, sivanath, shastri, and, trailokyanath, sanyal, began, visiting, him, during, this, time, 1871, 1885, mazumdar, wrote, the, first, english, biography, of, ramakrishna, entitled, the, hindu, saint, in, the, theistic, quarterly, review, 1879, which, played, a, vital, role, in, introducing, ramakrishna, to, westerners, like, the, german, indologist, max, m, ller, newspapers, reported, that, ramakrishna, was, spreading, love, and, devotion, among, the, educated, classes, of, kolkata, and, that, he, had, succeeded, in, reforming, the, character, of, some, youths, whose, morals, had, been, corrupt, ramakrishna, also, had, interactions, with, debendranath, tagore, the, father, of, rabindranath, tagore, and, ishwar, chandra, vidyasagar, a, renowned, social, worker, he, had, also, met, swami, dayananda, ramakrishna, is, considered, one, of, the, main, contributors, to, the, bengali, renaissance, among, the, europeans, who, were, influenced, by, ramakrishna, was, principal, dr, william, hastie, of, the, scottish, church, college, kolkata, in, the, course, of, explaining, the, word, trance, in, the, poem, the, excursion, by, william, wordsworth, hastie, told, his, students, that, if, they, wanted, to, know, its, real, meaning, they, should, go, to, ramakrishna, of, dakshineswar, this, prompted, some, of, his, students, including, narendranath, dutta, later, swami, vivekananda, to, visit, ramakrishna, despite, initial, reservations, vivekananda, became, ramakrishna, s, most, influential, follower, popularizing, a, modern, interpretation, of, indian, traditions, which, harmonised, tantra, yoga, and, advaita, vedanta, vivekananda, established, the, ramakrishna, order, which, eventually, spread, its, mission, posts, throughout, the, world, monastic, disciples, who, renounced, their, family, and, became, the, earliest, monks, of, the, ramakrishna,

early, members, who, joined, the, ramakrishna, order, his, chief, disciples, consisted, of, in, preparation, for, monastic, life, ramakrishna, ordered, his, monastic, disciples, to, beg, their, food, from, door, to, door, without, distinction, of, caste, he, gave, them, the, saffron, robe, the, sign, of, the, sanyasi, and, initiated, them, with, mantra, deeksha, in, the, beginning, of, 1885, ramakrishna, suffered, from, clergyman, s, throat, which, gradually, developed, into, throat, cancer, he, was, moved, to, shyampukur, near, kolkata, where, some, of, the, best, physicians, of, the, time, including, dr, mahendralal, sarkar, were, engaged, when, his, condition, aggravated, he, was, relocated, to, a, large, garden, house, at, cossipore, on, 11, december, 1885, during, his, last, days, he, was, looked, after, by, his, monastic, disciples, and, sarada, devi, ramakrishna, was, advised, by, the, doctors, to, keep, the, strictest, silence, but, ignoring, their, advice, he, incessantly, conversed, with, visitors, according, to, traditional, accounts, before, his, death, ramakrishna, transferred, his, spiritual, powers, to, vivekananda, and, assured, him, of, his, avataric, status, requesting, other, monastic, disciples, to, look, upon, vivekananda, as, their, leader, ramakrishna, asked, vivekananda, to, look, after, the, welfare, of, the, disciples, saying, keep, my, boys, together, and, asked, him, to, teach, them, ramakrishna, s, condition, gradually, worsened, and, he, died, in, the, early, morning, hours, of, 16, august, 1886, at, the, cossipore, garden, house, according, to, his, disciples, this, was, mahasamadhi, his, last, word, on, one, account, was, ma, while, another, states, he, uttered, thrice, the, word, kali, before, passing, away, after, the, death, of, their, master, the, monastic, disciples, led, by, vivekananda, formed, a, fellowship, at, a, half, ruined, house, at, baranagar, near, the, river, ganges, with, the, financial, assistance, of, the, householder, disciples, this, became, the, first, math, or, monastery, of, the, disciples, who, constituted, the, first, ramakrishna, order, max, m, ller, portrayed, ramakrishna, as, a, bhakta, a, worshipper, or, lover, of, the, deity, much, more, than, a, g, nin, or, a, knower, postcolonial, literary, theorist, gayatri, chakravorty, spivak, wrote, that, ramakrishna, was, a, bengali, bhakta, visionary, and, that, as, a, bhakta, he, turned, chiefly, towards, kali, indologist, heinrich, zimmer, was, the, first, western, scholar, to, interpret, ramakrishna, s, worship, of, the, divine, mother, as, containing, specifically, tantric, elements, neeval, also, argued, that, tantra, played, a, main, role, in, ramakrishna, s, spiritual, development, vivekananda, portrayed, ramakrishna, as, an, advaita, vedantin, vivekananda, s, approach, can, be, located, in, the, historical, background, of, ramakrishna, and, calcutta, during, the, mid, 19th, century, neevel, notes, that, the, image, of, ramakrishna, underwent, several, transformations, in, the, writings, of, his, prominent, admirers, who, changed, the, religious, madman, into, a, calm, and, well, behaving, proponent, of, advaita, vedanta, narasingha, sil, has, argued, that, vivekananda, revised, and, mythologised, ramakrishna, s, image, after, ramakrishna, s, death, mcdaniel, notes, that, the, ramakrishna, mission, is, biased, towards, advaita, vedanta, and, downplays, the, importance, of, shaktism, in, ramakrishna, s, spirituality, malcolm, mclean, argued, that, the, ramakrishna, movement, presents, a, particular, kind, of, explanation, of, ramakrishna, that, he, was, some, kind, of, neo, vedantist, who, taught, that, all, religions, lead, to, the, same, godhead, another, set, of, commentators, suggest, that, his, philosophy, is, best, understood, as, a, nonsectarian, vedanta, which, reconciles, various, philosophical, perspectives, commentators, such, as, satis, chandra, chatterjee, and, jeffery, long, have, described, ramakrishna, s, philosophy, as, a, harmonizing, form, of, vedanta, using, terms, like, samanvayi, vedanta, or, integral, vedanta, ayon, maharaj, supports, these, scholars, view, proposing, that, ramakrishna, s, teachings, are, best, understood, through, a, nonsectarian, vedantic, framework, specifically, characterizing, his, philosophy, as, vijnana, vedanta, carl, olson, argued, that, in, his, presentation, of, his, master, vivekananda, had, hid, much, of, ramakrishna, s, embarrassing, sexual, oddities, from, the, public, because, he, feared, that, ramakrishna, would, be, misunderstood, tyagananda, and, vrajaprana, argue, that, oslon, makes, his, astonishing, claim, based, on, kripal, s, speculations, in, kali, s, child, which, they, argue, are, unsupported, by, any, of, the, source, texts, sumit, sarkar, argued, that, he, found, in, the, kathamrita, traces, of, a, binary, opposition, between, unlearned, oral, wisdom, and, learned, literate, knowledge, he, argues, that, all, of, our, information, about, ramakrishna, a, rustic, near, illiterate, brahmin, comes, from, urban, bhadralok, devotees, whose, texts, simultaneously, illuminate, and, transform, amiya, prosad, sen, criticises, neevel, s, analysis, and, writes, that, it, is, really, difficult, to, separate, the, tantrik, ramakrishna, from, the, vedantic, since, vedanta, and, tantra, may, appear, to, be, different, in, some, respects, but, they, also, share, some, important, postulates, between, them, from, his, 10th, or, 11th, year, of, school, trances, became, a, common, part, of, his, life, and, by, his, final, years, ramakrishna, s, samadhi, periods, occurred, almost, daily, early, on, these, experiences, have, been, interpreted, as, epileptic, seizures, an, interpretation, which, was, rejected, by, ramakrishna, himself, in, 1927, romain, roland, discussed, with, sigmund, freud, the, oceanic, feeling, described, by, ramakrishna, sudhir, kakar, 1991, jeffrey, kripal, 1995, and, narasingha, sil, 1998, analysed, ramakrishna, s, mysticism, and, religious, practices, using, psychoanalysis, arguing, that, his, mystical, visions, refusal, to, comply, with, ritual, copulation, in, tantra, madhura, bhava, and, criticism, of, kamini, kanchana, women, and, gold, reflect, homosexuality, the, dialogue, on, psychoanalysis, and, ramakrishna, began, in, 1927, when, sigmund, freud, s, friend, romain, rolland, wrote, to, him, that, he, should, consider, spiritual, experiences, or, the, oceanic, feeling, in, his, psychological, works, romain, rolland, described, the, trances, and, mystical, states, experienced, by, ramakrishna, and, other, mystics, as, an, oceanic, sentiment, one, which, rolland, had, also, experienced, rolland, believed, that, the, universal, human, religious, emotion, resembled, this, oceanic, sense, in, his, 1929, book, la, vie, de, ramakrishna, rolland, distinguished, between, the, feelings, of, unity, and, eternity, which, ramakrishna, experienced, in, his, mystical, states, and, ramakrishna, s, interpretation, of, those, feelings, as, the, goddess, kali, in, his, 1991, book, the, analyst, and, the, mystic, indian, psychoanalyst, sudhir, kakar, saw, in, ramakrishna, s, visions, a, spontaneous, capacity, for, creative, experiencing, kakar, also, argued, that, culturally, relative, concepts, of, eroticism, and, gender, have, contributed, to, the, western, difficulty, in, comprehending, ramakrishna, kakar, saw, ramakrishna, s, seemingly, bizarre, acts, as, part, of, a, bhakti, path, to, god, in, 1995, jeffrey, j, kripal, in, his, controversial, kali, s, child, the, mystical, and, the, erotic, in, the, life, and, teachings, of, ramakrishna, an, interdisciplinary, study, of, ramakrishna, s, life, using, a, range, of, theoretical, models, most, notably, psycho, analysis, argued, that, ramakrishna, s, mystical, experiences, could, be, seen, as, symptoms, of, repressed, homoeroticism, legitimat, ramakrishna, s, religious, visions, by, situating, psychoanalytic, discourse, in, a, wider, tantric, worldview, jeffrey, j, kripal, argued, that, ramakrishna, rejected, advaita, vedanta, in, favour, of, shakti, tantra, kripal, also, argued, in, kali, s, child, that, the, ramakrishna, movement, had, manipulated, ramakrishna, s, biographical, documents, that, the, movement, had, published, them, in, incomplete, and, bowdlerised, editions, claiming, among, other, things, hiding, ramakrishna, s, homoerotic, tendencies, and, that, the, movement, had, suppressed, ram, chandra, datta, s, srisriramakrsna, paramahamsadever, jivanavrttanta, these, views, were, disputed, by, several, authors, scholars, and, psychoanalysts, including, alan, roland, kelly, aan, raab, somnath, bhattacharyya, j, s, hawley, and, swami, atmajnanananda, who, wrote, that, jivanavrttanta, had, been, reprinted, nine, times, in, bengali, as, of, 1995,

realization, kripal, associates, his, translation, of, the, phrase, with, ramakrishna, s, alleged, disgust, for, women, as, lovers, swami, tyagananda, considered, this, to, be, a, linguistic, misconstruction, ramakrishna, also, cautioned, his, women, disciples, against, purusa, kanchana, man, and, gold, and, tyagananda, writes, that, ramakrishna, used, kamini, kanchana, as, cautionary, words, instructing, his, disciples, to, conquer, the, lust, inside, the, mind, the, application, of, psychoanalysis, has, further, been, disputed, by, tyagananda, and, vrajaprana, as, being, unreliable, in, understanding, tantra, and, interpreting, cross, cultural, contexts, in, interpreting, ramakrishna, kali, s, child, revisited, 2010, the, principal, source, for, ramakrishna, s,
