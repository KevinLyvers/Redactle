mathematicians, he, was, the, founder, of, modern, functional, analysis, and, an, original, member, of, the, lw, w, school, of, mathematics, his, major, work, was, the, 1932, book, th, orie, des, op, rations, lin, aires, theory, of, linear, operations, the, first, monograph, on, the, general, theory, of, functional, analysis, born, in, krak, w, to, a, family, of, goral, descent, banach, showed, a, keen, interest, in, mathematics, and, engaged, in, solving, mathematical, problems, during, school, recess, after, completing, his, secondary, education, he, befriended, hugo, steinhaus, with, whom, he, established, the, polish, mathematical, society, in, 1919, and, later, published, the, scientific, journal, studia, mathematica, in, 1920, he, received, an, assistantship, at, the, lw, w, polytechnic, subsequently, becoming, a, professor, in, 1922, and, a, member, of, the, polish, academy, of, learning, in, 1924, banach, was, also, a, co, founder, of, the, lw, w, school, of, mathematics, a, school, of, thought, comprising, some, of, the, most, renowned, polish, mathematicians, of, the, interwar, period, 1918, 1939, some, of, the, notable, mathematical, concepts, that, bear, banach, s, name, include, banach, spaces, banach, algebras, banach, measures, the, banach, tarski, paradox, the, hahn, banach, theorem, the, banach, steinhaus, theorem, the, banach, mazur, game, the, banach, alaoglu, theorem, and, the, banach, fixed, point, theorem, stefan, banach, was, born, on, 30, march, 1892, at, st, lazarus, general, hospital, in, krak, w, then, part, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, into, a, g, ral, roman, catholic, family, and, was, subsequently, baptised, by, his, father, banach, s, parents, were, stefan, greczek, and, katarzyna, banach, both, natives, of,

was, born, in, bor, wna, and, worked, as, a, domestic, helper, unusually, stefan, s, surname, was, his, mother, s, instead, of, his, father, s, though, he, received, his, father, s, given, name, stefan, military, regulations, did, not, permit, soldiers, of, stefan, greczek, s, rank, to, marry, he, was, a, private, and, as, the, mother, was, too, poor, to, support, the, child, the, couple, decided, that, he, should, be, reared, by, family, and, friends, stefan, spent, the, first, few, years, of, his, life, with, his, grandmother, but, when, she, was, taken, ill, greczek, arranged, for, his, son, to, be, raised, by, franciszka, p, owa, and, her, niece, maria, puchalska, in, krak, w, young, stefan, came, to, regard, franciszka, as, his, foster, mother, and, maria, as, his, older, sister, in, his, early, years, banach, was, tutored, by, juliusz, mien, a, french, intellectual, and, friend, of, the, p, owa, family, who, had, emigrated, to, poland, and, supported, himself, with, photography, and, translations, of, polish, literature, into, french, mien, taught, banach, french, and, most, likely, encouraged, him, in, his, early, mathematical, pursuits, in, 1902, banach, aged, 10, enrolled, in, krak, w, s, iv, gymnasium, also, known, as, the, goetz, gymnasium, while, the, school, specialized, in, the, humanities, banach, and, his, best, friend, witold, wi, kosz, also, a, future, mathematician, spent, most, of, their, time, working, on, mathematics, problems, during, breaks, and, after, school, later, in, life, banach, credited, dr, kamil, kraft, the, mathematics, and, physics, teacher, at, the, school, with, kindling, his, interests, in, mathematics, while, banach, was, a, diligent, student, he, did, on, occasion, receive, low, grades, he, failed, greek, during, his, first, semester, at, the, school, and, later, spoke, critically, of, the, school, s, math, teachers, after, obtaining, his, matura, high, school, degree, at, age, 18, in, 1910, banach, moved, to, lw, w, today, called, lviv, with, the, intention, of, studying, at, the, lw, w, polytechnic, he, initially, chose, engineering, as, his, field, of, study, since, at, the, time, he, was, convinced, that, there, was, nothing, new, to, discover, in, mathematics, at, some, point, he, also, attended, jagiellonian, university, in, krak, w, on, a, part, time, basis, as, banach, had, to, earn, money, to, support, his, studies, it, was, not, until, 1914, that, he, finally, at, age, 22, passed, his, high, school, graduation, exams, when, world, war, i, broke, out, banach, was, excused, from, military, service, due, to, his, left, handedness, and, poor, vision, when, the, russian, army, opened, its, offensive, toward, lw, w, banach, left, for, krak, w, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, the, war, he, made, his, living, as, a, tutor, at, the, local, schools, worked, in, a, bookstore, and, as, a, foreman, of, a, road, building, crew, he, attended, some, lectures, at, the, jagiellonian, university, at, that, time, including, those, of, the, famous, polish, mathematicians, stanis, aw, zaremba, and, kazimierz, orawski, but, little, is, known, of, that, period, of, his, life, in, 1916, in, krak, w, s, planty, park, banach, encountered, professor, hugo, steinhaus, one, of, the, renowned, mathematicians, of, the, time, according, to, steinhaus, while, he, was, strolling, through, the, gardens, he, was, surprised, to, overhear, the, term, lebesgue, integral, lebesgue, integration, was, at, the, time, still, a, fairly, new, idea, in, mathematics, and, walked, over, to, investigate, as, a, result, he, met, banach, as, well, as, otto, nikodym, steinhaus, became, fascinated, with, the, self, taught, young, mathematician, the, encounter, resulted, in, a, long, lasting, collaboration, and, friendship, in, fact, soon, after, the, encounter, steinhaus, invited, banach, to, solve, some, problems, he, had, been, working, on, but, which, had, proven, difficult, banach, solved, them, within, a, week, and, the, two, soon, published, their, first, joint, work, on, the, mean, convergence, of, fourier, series, steinhaus, banach, and, nikodym, along, with, several, other, krak, w, mathematicians, w, adys, aw, lebodzi, ski, leon, chwistek, alfred, rosenblatt, and, w, odzimierz, sto, ek, also, established, a, mathematical, society, which, eventually, became, the, polish, mathematical, society, the, society, was, officially, founded, on, 2, april, 1919, it, was, also, through, steinhaus, that, banach, met, his, future, wife, ucja, braus, steinhaus, introduced, banach, to, academic, circles, and, substantially, accelerated, his, career, after, poland, regained, independence, in, 1918, banach, was, given, an, assistantship, at, the, lw, w, polytechnic, steinhaus, backing, also, allowed, him, to, receive, a, doctorate, without, actually, graduating, from, a, university, the, doctoral, thesis, accepted, by, king, john, ii, casimir, university, of, lw, w, in, 1920, and, published, in, 1922, included, the, basic, ideas, of, functional, analysis, which, was, soon, to, become, an, entirely, new, branch, of, mathematics, in, his, dissertation, written, in, 1920, he, axiomatically, defined, what, is, today, called, a, banach, space, the, thesis, was, widely, discussed, in, academic, circles, and, allowed, him, in, 1922, to, become, a, professor, at, the, lw, w, polytechnic, initially, an, assistant, to, professor, antoni, omnicki, in, 1927, banach, received, his, own, chair, in, 1924, he, was, accepted, as, a, member, of, the, polish, academy, of, learning, at, the, same, time, from, 1922, banach, also, headed, the, second, chair, of, mathematics, at, university, of, lw, w, young, and, talented, banach, gathered, around, him, a, large, group, of, mathematicians, the, group, meeting, in, the, scottish, caf, soon, gave, birth, to, the, lw, w, school, of, mathematics, in, 1929, the, group, began, publishing, its, own, journal, studia, mathematica, devoted, primarily, to, banach, s, field, of, study, functional, analysis, around, that, time, banach, also, began, working, on, his, best, known, work, the, first, monograph, on, the, general, theory, of, linear, metric, space, first, published, in, polish, in, 1931, the, next, year, it, was, also, translated, into, french, and, gained, wider, recognition, in, european, academic, circles, the, book, was, also, the, first, in, a, long, series, of, mathematics, monographs, edited, by, banach, and, his, circle, on, 17, june, 1924, banach, become, a, correspondence, member, of, the, polish, academy, of, sciences, and, fine, arts, in, krak, w, after, the, invasion, of, poland, by, nazi, germany, and, the, soviet, union, lw, w, came, under, the, control, of, the, soviet, union, for, almost, two, years, banach, from, 1939, a, corresponding, member, of, the, academy, of, sciences, of, ukraine, and, on, good, terms, with, soviet, mathematicians, had, to, promise, to, learn, ukrainian, to, be, allowed, to, keep, his, chair, and, continue, his, academic, activities, after, the, german, takeover, of, lw, w, in, 1941, during, operation, barbarossa, all, universities, were, closed, and, banach, along, with, many, colleagues, and, his, son, was, employed, as, a, lice, feeder, at, professor, rudolf, weigl, s, typhus, research, institute, employment, in, weigl, s, institute, provided, many, unemployed, university, professors, and, their, associates, protection, from, random, arrest, and, deportation, to, nazi, concentration, camps, after, the, soviet, red, army, recaptured, lviv, in, the, lvov, sandomierz, offensive, of, 1944, banach, returned, to, the, university, and, helped, re, establish, it, after, the, war, years, however, because, the, soviets, were, deporting, poles, from, annexed, formerly, polish, eastern, territories, banach, began, preparing, to, leave, the, city, and, settle, in, krak, w, poland, where, he, had, been, promised, a, chair, at, the, jagiellonian, university, he, was, also, considered, a, candidate, for, minister, of, education, of, poland, in, january, 1945, he, was, diagnosed, with, lung, cancer, and, was, permitted, to, stay, in, lw, w, he, died, on, 31, august, 1945, aged, 53, his, funeral, at, the, lychakiv, cemetery, cmentarz, yczakowski, was, attended, by, hundreds, of, people, banach, s, dissertation, completed, in, 1920, and, published, in, 1922, formally, axiomatized, the, concept, of, a, complete, normed, vector, space, and, laid, the, foundations, for, the, area, of, functional, analysis, in, this, work, banach, called, such, spaces, class, e, spaces, but, in, his, 1932, book, th, orie, des, op, rations, lin, aires, he, changed, terminology, and, referred, to, them, as, spaces, of, type, b, which, most, likely, contributed, to, the, subsequent, eponymous, naming, of, these, spaces, after, him, the, theory, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, banach, spaces, had, antecedents, in, the, work, of, the, hungarian, mathematician, frigyes, riesz, published, in, 1916, and, contemporaneous, contributions, from, hans, hahn, and, norbert, wiener, for, a, brief, period, in, fact, complete, normed, linear, spaces, were, referred, to, as, banach, wiener, spaces, in, mathematical, literature, based, on, terminology, introduced, by, wiener, himself, however, because, wiener, s, work, on, the, topic, was, limited, the, established, name, became, just, banach, spaces, likewise, banach, s, fixed, point, theorem, based, on, earlier, methods, developed, by, charles, mile, picard, was, included, in, his, dissertation, and, was, later, extended, by, his, students, for, example, in, the, banach, schauder, theorem, and, other, mathematicians, in, particular, brouwer, and, poincar, and, birkhoff, the, theorem, did, not, require, linearity, of, the, space, and, applied, to, any, complete, cauchy, space, in, particular, to, any, complete, metric, space, the, hahn, banach, theorem, is, one, of, the, fundamental, theorems, of, functional, analysis, further, theorems, related, to, banach, are, in, 1946, the, stefan, banach, prize, polish, nagroda, im, stefana, banacha, was, established, by, the, polish, mathematical, society, in, 1992, the, institute, of, mathematics, of, the, polish, academy, of, sciences, established, a, special, stefan, banach, medal, for, outstanding, achievements, in, mathematical, sciences, since, 2009, the, international, stefan, banach, prize, has, been, conferred, by, the, polish, mathematical, society, to, mathematicians, for, best, doctoral, dissertations, in, the, mathematical, sciences, with, the, objective, to, promote, and, financially, support, the, most, promising, young, researchers, stefan, banach, is, the, patron, of, a, number, of, schools, and, streets, including, in, warsaw, lviv, widnica, toru, and, jaros, aw, in, 2001, a, minor, planet, 16856, banach, discovered, by, paul, comba, in, 1997, was, named, after, him, in, 2012, the, national, bank, of, poland, celebrated, the, mathematician, s, achievements, by, issuing, a, series, of, commemorative, coins, designed, by, robert, kotowicz, golden, 200, zloty, coin, silver, 10, zloty, coin, and, nordic, gold, 2, zloty, coin, in, 2016, a, commemorative, bench, featuring, banach, and, otto, nikodym, was, unveiled, in, krak, w, s, planty, park, on, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, conversation, the, two, mathematicians, held, when, they, first, met, hugo, steinhaus, which, proved, instrumental, in, the, development, of, his, scientific, career, in, 2021, one, of, the, episodes, of, polish, documentary, tv, series, geniusze, i, marzyciele, geniuses, and, dreamers, aired, on, tvp1, and, tvp, dokument, channels, was, devoted, to, stefan, banach, in, 2022, google, doodle, commemorated, the, 100th, anniversary, of, banach, receiving, his, title, of, professor, stanislaw, ulam, another, mathematician, of, the, lw, w, school, of, mathematics, in, his, autobiography, quotes, banach, as, saying, good, mathematicians, see, analogies, between, theorems, or, theories, the, very, best, ones, see, analogies, between, analogies, hugo, steinhaus, said, of, banach, banach, was, my, greatest, scientific, discovery
