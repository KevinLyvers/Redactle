annual, population, growth, during, the, 1970s, something, which, would, double, the, country, s, population, in, just, over, 25, years, obasanjo, later, noted, that, he, was, unaware, of, this, at, the, time, with, his, government, having, no, policy, on, population, control, nigeria, s, population, growth, contributed, to, rapid, urbanisation, and, an, urban, housing, shortage, to, deal, with, this, obasanjo, s, 1976, budget, outlined, plans, for, the, construction, of, 200, 000, new, housing, units, by, 1980, although, ultimately, only, 28, 500, were, built, in, 1976, obasanjo, s, government, also, announced, rent, and, price, controls, to, counteract, the, disruption, of, labour, strikes, in, 1976, obasanjo, s, government, introduced, legislation, that, defined, most, major, industries, as, essential, services, banned, strikes, within, them, and, authorised, the, detention, of, disruptive, union, leaders, in, 1978, it, merged, 42, unions, into, the, single, nigerian, labour, congress, obasanjo, continued, with, three, major, irrigation, schemes, in, northern, nigeria, that, were, first, announced, under, murtala, the, kano, river, project, the, bakalori, scheme, and, the, south, chad, irrigation, project, his, government, also, continued, the, agricultural, development, projects, launched, in, funtua, gusau, and, gombe, some, reforestation, projects, were, also, initiated, to, stall, the, encroachment, of, the, sahara, desert, in, the, north, to, meet, the, country, s, growing, demand, for, electricity, obasanjo, oversaw, the, launch, of, two, new, hydroelectric, projects, and, a, thermal, plant, the, oil, industry, remained, an, important, part, of, nigeria, s, economy, and, under, obasanjo, the, ministry, of, petroleum, resources, was, merged, with, the, nigerian, national, oil, corporation, to, form, the, nigerian, national, petroleum, corporation, nnpc, obasanjo, also, supported, the, creation, of, a, liquefaction, plant, at, bonny, which, was, 62, financed, by, the, nnpc, the, project, was, abandoned, by, his, successor, amid, spiralling, cost, increases, obasanjo, also, continued, the, planning, of, the, ajaokuta, integrated, steel, mill, an, inherited, project, that, many, critics, in, the, civil, service, argued, was, unviable, in, the, mid, 1970s, nigeria, also, faced, declining, agricultural, production, a, process, caused, by, successive, governments, finding, it, cheaper, to, import, food, than, grow, it, domestically, in, may, 1976, obasanjo, launched, operation, feed, the, nation, a, project, to, revitalise, small, scale, farming, and, which, involved, students, being, paid, to, farm, during, the, holidays, the, project, also, involved, abolishing, duties, on, livestock, feed, and, farm, implements, subsidizing, the, use, of, fertilisers, and, easing, agricultural, credit, in, march, 1978, obasanjo, issued, the, land, use, decree, which, gave, the, state, propriety, rights, over, all, land, this, was, designed, to, stop, land, hoarding, and, land, speculation, and, brought, praise, from, the, nigerian, left, although, was, disliked, by, many, land, owning, families, obasanjo, saw, it, as, one, of, his, government, s, main, achievements, obasanjo, continued, the, push, for, universal, primary, education, in, nigeria, a, policy, inherited, from, gowon, he, introduced, the, primary, education, act, in, 1976, between, 1975, 76, and, 1979, 80, enrolment, in, free, but, voluntary, primary, schooling, grew, from, 6, million, to, 12, 5, million, although, there, was, a, shortage, of, teachers, and, materials, to, cope, with, the, demand, in, the, 1977, 78, school, year, obasanjo, introduced, free, secondary, educational, in, technical, subjects, something, extended, to, all, secondary, schooling, in, 1979, 80, concomitantly, nigeria, cut, back, on, university, funding, in, 1978, it, ceased, issuing, student, loans, and, trebled, university, food, and, accommodation, charges, student, protests, erupted, in, several, cities, resulting, in, fatal, shootings, in, lagos, and, zaria, in, response, to, the, unrest, obasanjo, closed, several, universities, banned, political, activity, on, campus, and, proscribed, the, national, union, of, nigerian, students, the, severity, of, these, measures, was, perhaps, due, to, suspicions, that, the, student, unrest, was, linked, to, a, planned, military, coup, that, was, uncovered, in, february, 1978, obasanjo, was, frustrated, at, the, protesting, student, s, behaviour, arguing, that, it, reflected, a, turn, away, from, traditional, values, such, as, respect, for, elders, as, a, consequence, of, nigeria, s, state, directed, development, the, country, saw, a, rapid, growth, in, the, public, sector, evidence, emerged, of, extensive, corruption, in, the, country, s, government, and, while, accusations, were, often, made, against, obasanjo, himself, no, hard, evidence, was, produced, to, hinder, the, image, of, corruption, in, the, government, obasanjo, s, administration, banned, the, use, of, mercedes, cars, as, government, transport, and, instead, introduced, more, modest, peugeot, 504s, the, import, of, champagne, was, also, banned, pushing, for, cut, backs, in, the, military, obasanjo, s, government, saw, 12, 000, soldiers, demobilised, over, the, course, of, 1976, and, 1977, these, troops, went, through, new, rehabilitation, centres, to, assist, them, in, adjusting, to, civilian, life, obasanjo, was, also, accused, of, being, responsible, for, political, repression, in, one, famous, instance, the, compound, of, the, nigerian, musician, and, political, activist, fela, kuti, kalakuta, republic, was, raided, and, burned, to, the, ground, after, a, member, of, his, entourage, was, involved, in, an, altercation, with, military, personnel, fela, and, his, family, were, beaten, and, raped, and, his, aged, mother, the, political, activist, and, founding, mother, chief, funmilayo, ransome, kuti, was, thrown, from, a, window, this, resulted, in, serious, injuries, and, eventually, led, to, her, death, fela, subsequently, carried, a, coffin, to, the, then, presidential, residence, at, dodan, barracks, in, lagos, as, a, protest, against, the, government, s, political, repression, obasanjo, was, eager, to, establish, nigeria, as, a, prominent, leader, in, africa, and, under, his, tenure, its, influence, in, the, continent, increased, he, revived, gowon, s, plan, to, hold, the, second, world, black, and, african, festival, of, arts, and, culture, in, nigeria, it, took, place, in, lagos, in, february, 1977, although, domestic, critics, argued, that, it, was, too, expensive, obasanjo, gave, low, priority, to, the, economic, community, of, west, african, states, ecowas, and, angered, many, of, its, francophone, members, after, insisting, that, as, the, largest, financial, contributor, to, the, organisation, nigeria, should, host, the, organisation, s, headquarters, in, lagos, relations, with, nearby, ghana, also, declined, in, 1979, nigeria, cut, off, oil, supplies, to, the, country, to, protest, the, execution, of, political, opponents, by, jerry, rawlings, new, military, junta, under, obasanjo, nigeria, loosened, its, longstanding, ties, with, the, united, kingdom, and, aligned, more, closely, with, the, united, states, obasanjo, was, favourable, to, the, u, s, government, of, jimmy, carter, who, was, elected, in, 1976, because, of, carter, s, commitment, to, ensuring, majority, rule, across, southern, africa, carter, s, ambassador, to, nigeria, andrew, young, formed, a, close, personal, friendship, with, obasanjo, while, carter, visited, nigeria, in, 1978, however, the, decision, to, shift, allegiances, was, made, for, pragmatic, rather, than, ideological, reasons, the, discovery, of, oil, in, the, north, sea, meant, that, the, uk, had, become, a, competitor, rather, than, a, customer, of, nigerian, oil, obasanjo, s, government, was, also, angry, that, the, uk, refused, to, extradite, gowon, and, suspected, that, the, british, government, might, have, been, involved, in, the, coup, against, murtala, for, these, reasons, in, 1976, it, considered, suspending, diplomatic, relations, with, the, uk, but, ultimately, did, not, obasanjo, nevertheless, refused, to, visit, the, uk, and, discouraged, his, officials, from, doing, so, relations, were, further, damaged, when, margaret, thatcher, became, british, prime, minister, in, 1979, initiating, a, warmer, british, approach, to, the, white, minority, administrations, of, rhodesia, and, south, africa, in, response, nigeria, seized, a, british, tanker, that, was, believed, to, be, transporting, nigerian, oil, to, south, africa, banned, british, firms, from, competing, for, nigerian, contracts, and, nationalised, british, petroleum, s, nigerian, operations, obasanjo, was, also, eager, to, hasten, the, end, of, white, minority, rule, in, southern, africa, according, to, iliffe, this, became, the, centrepiece, of, his, foreign, policy, nigeria, gave, grants, to, those, fighting, white, minority, rule, in, the, region, allowed, these, groups, to, open, offices, in, lagos, and, offered, sanctuary, to, various, refugees, fleeing, the, governments, of, southern, africa, taking, a, hard, line, against, the, apartheid, regime, in, south, africa, obasanjo, announced, that, nigeria, would, not, take, part, in, the, 1976, summer, olympics, because, new, zealand, which, was, competing, had, sporting, ties, with, south, africa, a, country, that, was, banned, from, competing, due, to, apartheid, in, 1977, obasanjo, barred, any, contractors, with, south, african, links, from, operating, in, nigeria, the, main, companies, that, were, hit, were, british, petroleum, and, barclays, bank, that, same, year, nigeria, hosted, the, united, nations, conference, for, action, against, apartheid, in, lagos, while, obasanjo, visited, the, u, s, in, october, where, he, urged, the, country, to, stop, selling, arms, to, south, africa, while, in, the, country, he, addressed, the, united, nations, general, assembly, and, two, weeks, later, nigeria, received, a, seat, on, the, united, nations, security, council, opposition, to, white, minority, rule, in, rhodesia, had, sparked, the, rhodesian, bush, war, and, obasanjo, s, government, maintained, that, armed, struggle, was, the, only, option, for, overthrowing, rhodesia, s, government, he, encouraged, unity, among, the, various, anti, government, factions, there, urging, robert, mugabe, the, head, of, zanu, to, accept, the, leadership, of, his, rival, joshua, nkomo, of, zapu, in, 1977, the, uk, and, us, drew, up, proposals, for, a, transition, to, majority, rule, in, rhodesia, amid, a, period, in, which, the, country, would, be, under, the, management, of, united, nations, forces, obasanjo, backed, the, plan, and, visited, tanzania, zambia, mozambique, and, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, to, urge, their, governments, to, do, the, same, however, after, thatcher, became, uk, prime, minister, nigeria, distanced, itself, from, british, efforts, to, end, the, rhodesian, bush, war, and, was, excluded, from, any, significant, role, in, the, uk, brokered, process, that, led, to, multi, racial, democratic, elections, in, rhodesia, as, head, of, state, obasanjo, attended, oau, summits, at, that, held, in, july, 1977, he, proposed, the, formation, of, a, standing, committee, to, mediate, disputes, between, oau, member, states, at, the, 1978, conference, he, warned, of, interference, from, both, sides, in, the, cold, war, at, the, next, conference, he, urged, the, formation, of, a, pan, african, military, which, could, engage, in, peace, keeping, efforts, on, the, continent, to, promote, nigeria, s, role, internationally, obasanjo, involved, himself, in, various, mediation, efforts, across, africa, in, 1977, he, persuaded, benin, and, togo, to, end, their, border, dispute, and, reopen, their, frontier, he, also, attempted, to, mediate, a, quarrel, among, several, east, african, states, and, thus, prevent, the, collapse, of, the, east, african, community, but, failed, in, this, attempt, as, the, chair, of, the, oau, mediation, committee, he, tried, to, mediate, the, ogaden, dispute, between, ethiopia, and, somalia, but, was, again, unsuccessful, he, also, failed, to, mend, the, breach, that, had, emerged, between, angola, and, the, democratic, republic, of, congo, on, behalf, of, the, oau, obasanjo, held, a, conference, at, kano, to, mediate, the, chadian, civil, war, several, factions, agreed, to, a, ceasefire, to, form, a, government, of, national, unity, and, to, allow, nigerian, troops, to, act, as, peacekeepers, the, war, nevertheless, continued, and, nigeria, responded, by, cutting, off, its, oil, supply, to, chad, a, second, conference, on, the, conflict, took, place, in, lagos, in, august, 1979, resulting, in, the, formation, of, another, short, lived, transitional, government, in, the, final, year, of, his, military, government, he, headed, an, oau, mission, to, resolve, the, conflict, in, western, sahara, the, military, government, has, assembled, a, constituent, drafting, committee, to, devise, a, new, constitution, which, could, be, used, amid, a, transfer, to, civilian, rule, the, committee, argued, that, nigeria, should, change, its, governance, system, which, was, based, on, the, british, parliamentary, system, to, one, based, on, the, u, s, presidential, system, whereby, a, single, elected, president, would, be, both, head, of, state, and, head, of, government, to, avoid, this, president, becoming, a, dictator, as, had, happened, elsewhere, in, africa, it, argued, for, various, checks, on, their, power, including, a, federal, structure, whereby, independent, elected, institutions, would, exist, at, the, federal, state, and, local, level, the, draft, constitution, was, published, in, october, 1976, and, debated, in, public, for, the, following, year, a, constituent, assembly, met, to, discuss, the, draft, in, october, 1977, the, assembly, deadlocked, over, what, role, to, give, sharia, law, in, the, constitution, obasanjo, called, the, assembly, together, and, warned, them, of, the, social, impact, of, their, decision, urging, them, to, take, a, more, conciliatory, attitude, in, september, 1978, the, supreme, military, council, announced, the, new, constitution, it, had, made, several, amendments, to, the, version, put, forward, by, the, constituent, assembly, along, with, the, new, constitution, obasanjo, lifted, the, ban, on, political, parties, a, variety, of, groups, then, formed, to, compete, in, the, ensuing, election, most, notably, the, unity, party, of, yoruba, the, nigerian, people, s, party, and, the, national, party, of, nigeria, obasanjo, was, angered, that, many, of, the, politicians, were, making, promises, that, they, could, not, keep, the, elections, took, place, over, the, course, of, july, and, august, 1979, turnout, was, low, at, between, 30, and, 40, percent, of, legally, registered, voters, and, there, was, rigging, on, various, sides, although, it, was, peaceful, there, was, debate, as, to, who, won, the, presidential, vote, and, obasanjo, refused, to, adjudicate, insisting, that, the, electoral, commission, take, on, that, role, they, declared, that, shehu, shagari, was, the, winner, something, that, the, runner, up, obafemi, awolowo, unsuccessfully, challenged, at, the, supreme, court, shagari, took, office, in, october, 1979, at, his, inauguration, ceremony, obasanjo, presented, shagari, with, a, copy, of, the, new, constitution, this, marked, the, start, of, nigeria, s, second, republic, obasanjo, s, role, in, returning, nigeria, to, civilian, rule, would, form, the, basis, of, the, good, reputation, he, retained, for, the, next, two, decades, however, various, domestic, and, foreign, individuals, including, the, zambian, president, kenneth, kaunda, and, togo, president, gnassingb, eyad, ma, urged, him, to, remain, in, power, his, refusal, to, back, awolowo, a, fellow, yoruba, earned, him, the, enmity, of, much, of, the, yoruba, elite, awolowo, accused, obasanjo, of, orchestrating, shagari, s, victory, something, obasanjo, strenuously, denied, before, he, left, office, in, april, 1979, obasanjo, promoted, himself, to, the, role, of, general, as, a, four, star, general, he, continued, to, receive, a, salary, from, the, state, having, left, office, in, october, he, returned, to, abeokuta, following, a, six, week, course, at, an, agricultural, training, college, obasanjo, then, set, himself, up, as, a, farmer, hoping, to, set, an, example, in, encouraging, agricultural, self, reliance, he, obtained, at, least, 230, hectares, of, land, in, ota, on, which, to, establish, his, farm, there, moving, in, to, a, brick, farmhouse, there, was, local, hostility, to, his, obtaining, so, much, land, and, much, litigation, was, brought, against, him, because, of, it, his, agricultural, activities, were, organised, through, his, temperance, enterprises, limited, later, renamed,

august, 1985, buhari, was, also, overthrown, with, the, army, chief, of, staff, ibrahim, babangida, taking, power, obasanjo, was, critical, of, some, of, the, economic, reforms, that, babangida, introduced, including, the, devaluation, of, the, naira, by, 1992, his, opposition, to, babangida, s, rule, had, led, him, to, call, for, a, re, democratisation, of, nigeria, he, also, began, to, reject, the, economic, indigenisation, policies, of, the, 1970s, arguing, that, the, constitution, should, prohibit, the, confiscation, of, foreign, investments, instead, he, thought, the, government, should, emphasise, private, led, development, he, became, increasingly, concerned, by, rapid, population, growth, a, topic, he, had, ignored, while, in, power, urging, nigerians, to, have, smaller, families, in, their, own, economic, and, national, socio, economic, interest, during, the, eleven, years, after, obasanjo, left, office, he, published, four, books, in, 1980, obasanjo, was, a,

readers, criticised, what, they, saw, as, obasanjo, s, disloyalty, to, murtala, muhammed, while, robert, adeyinka, adebayo, a, senior, yoruba, political, figure, urged, for, the, book, to, be, withdrawn, to, prevent, it, sowing, division, a, more, positive, assessment, was, made, by, his, friend, ken, saro, wiwa, who, called, it, masterly, but, believed, that, it, had, involved, much,

during, a, period, of, growing, domestic, unrest, and, violence, there, they, met, with, senior, government, figures, including, prime, minister, p, w, botha, whom, obasanjo, later, described, as, the, most, intolerant, man, he, had, ever, met, the, epg, s, report, stated, that, while, a, majority, of, south, africans, desired, a, non, violent, negotiated, settlement, between, the, government, and, anti, apartheid, groups, the, former, was, unwilling, to, contemplate, this, and, had, made, no, significant, progress, towards, ending, apartheid, the, epg, thus, proposed, that, further, international, pressure, was, necessary, a, commonwealth, committee, accepted, the, report, s, findings, with, the, uk, dissenting, this, left, obasanjo, further, frustrated, with, thatcher, the, commonwealth, then, commissioned, him, to, head, a, committee, to, determine, what, the, frontline, states, needed, to, defend, themselves, from, south, african, incursions, after, botha, was,

agreed, to, step, down, in, favour, of, an, interim, civilian, government, led, by, ernest, shonekan, which, took, power, in, august, 1993, and, set, out, plans, for, new, elections, in, february, 1994, general, sani, abach, reminds, one, of, a, man, who, with, other, do, gooders, proposed, a, meal, for, the, blind, man, as, soon, as, the, others, turned, their, back, this, seemingly, good, samaritan, went, back, to, snatch, the, pot, of, soup, from, the, blind, man, for, himself, again, most, of, us, nigerians, as, spectators, applauded, under, all, sorts, of, excuses, there, was, no, shortage, of, partakers, in, the, meal, and, they, were, not, troubled, by, the, moral, implications, obasanjo, on, sani, abacha, s, coup, 1994, meanwhile, sani, abacha, consolidated, his, control, of, the, military, and, in, november, 1993, pressured, shonekan, into, resigning, allowing, himself, to, take, power, obasanjo, had, telephoned, abacha, prior, to, the, coup, urging, him, not, to,

president, and, was, arrested, for, treason, although, obasanjo, refused, to, endorse, abiola, s, claim, he, did, advise, abacha, not, to, arrest, him, he, then, led, a, group, of, traditional, leaders, at, a, meeting, in, which, they, attempted, to, initiate, a, dialogue, between, abacha, and, abiola, his, refusal, to, support, abiola, angered, many, yoruba, people, and, obasanjo, s, property, in, yorubaland, was, attacked, obasanjo, was, upset, by, what, he, saw, as, punishment, for, not, backing, yoruba, sectarian, interests, in, march, 1995, obasanjo, was, in, denmark, for, a, un, summit, on, social, development, in, copenhagen, while, there, he, heard, that, yar, adua, had, been, detained, and, that, he, would, probably, face, the, same, fate, if, he, returned, to, nigeria, he, nevertheless, argued, that, he, had, done, nothing, wrong, and, thus, decided, to, return, once, at, lagos, airport, his, passport, was, confiscated, and, the, next, day, police, picked, him, up, from, his, ota, home, the, police, accused, obasanjo, of, links, to, a, coup, against, abacha, being, plotted, by, colonel, lawan, gwadabe, obasanjo, was, moved, between, various, detention,

military, lawyer, had, been, tortured, during, which, he, signed, a, statement, that, he, had, gone, to, ota, to, inform, obasanjo, about, the, coup, as, it, was, in, preparation, this, was, used, as, evidence, to, charge, obasanjo, with, concealment, of, treason, a, capital, offense, under, nigerian, law, he, was, then, taken, to, the, state, security, interrogation, centre, at, ikoyi, abacha, insisted, that, obasanjo, be, tried, before, a, military, court, which, took, place, on, 19, june, 1995, at, the, trial, obasanjo, denied, that, bello, fadile, had, ever, met, with, him, bello, fadile, also, maintained, that, he, had, signed, the, statement, implicating, obasanjo, under, duress, but, the, court, rejected, this, retraction, on, 14, july, the, court, sentenced, obasanjo, to, 25, years, in, prison, yar, adua, and, fourteen, others, also, accused, of, being, part, of, the, conspiracy, were, sentenced, to, death, obasanjo, later, called, it, his, saddest, day, after, the, us, president, bill, clinton, stated, that, his, country, would, embargo, nigerian, oil, if, these, executions, took, place, abacha, commuted, their, sentences, to, imprisonment, and, reduced, obasanjo, s, sentence, to, 15, years, obasanjo, spent, the, next, four, months, at, the, ikoyi, centre, where, he, was, initially, chained, up, in, solitary, confinement, he, was, then, transferred, to, lagos, main, prison, kirikiri, where, he, spent, time, in, the, prison, hospital, for, his, hypertension, and, diabetes, conditions, in, kirikiri, were, overcrowded, and, unsanitary, with, obasanjo, stating, that, he, would, not, wish, it, on, my, worst, enemy, there, bello, fadile, apologised, to, obasanjo, for, having, implicated, him, at, which, obasanjo, forgave, him, a, note, written, by, bello, fadile, explaining, the, situation, was, then, smuggled, out, of, the, prison, and, published, helping, to, demonstrate, obasanjo, s, innocence, after, several, weeks, obasanjo, and, the, other, alleged, conspirators, were, moved, to, jos, prison, in, the, central, plateau, plateau, state, where, they, spent, several, months, obasanjo, was, initially, given, only, the, bible, and, quran, to, read, but, gradually, allowed, a, wider, range, of, literature, writing, material, was, also, granted, to, him, allowing, him, to, correspond, with, various, people, and, institutions, and, eventually, stella, was, permitted, to, visit, him, once, a, month, both, mandela, and, pope, john, paul, ii, called, for, his, release, with, indian, and, german, foundations, both, awarding, him, international, prizes, the, africa, leadership, forum, produced, two, volumes, of, letters, and, essays, written, in, his, honour, the, forum, itself, had, been, forced, to, relocate, to, accra, in, ghana, to, avoid, persecution, from, abacha, s, government, in, early, 1996, obasanjo, was, moved, from, jos, to, the, more, remote, prison, at, yola, adamawa, state, there, he, was, allowed, to, cultivate, a, garden, obasanjo, related, that, in, prison, he, deepened, his, christian, faith, and, grew, closer, to, god, becoming, a, born, again, christian, from, that, point, christianity, played, a, much, larger, role, in, his, personal, world, view, at, yola, he, preached, 28, weekly, sermons, after, visiting, ministers, were, temporarily, banned, he, wrote, these, sermons, down, allowing, them, to, be, published, when, he, was, released, obasanjo, also, tried, to, reform, some, of, the, younger, prisoners, following, up, on, their, progress, once, he, became, a, free, man, obasanjo, feared, that, he, would, be, poisoned, particularly, amid, public, speculation, that, yar, adua, s, death, had, been, caused, by, deliberate, poisoning, abacha, died, suddenly, in, june, 1998, after, which, the, military, commanders, appointed, major, general, abdulsalami, abubakar, as, his, successor, a, week, later, abubakar, ordered, obasanjo, s, release, sending, a, plane, to, return, him, to, ota, eager, to, return, nigeria, to, civilian, rule, abubakar, dissolved, the, country, s, existing, parties, and, institutions, and, announced, a, plan, that, would, lead, to, a, civilian, president, being, installed, in, may, 1999, now, a, free, man, obasanjo, travelled, to, south, africa, the, united, kingdom, and, the, united, states, where, he, underwent, medical, treatment, new, political, parties, were, forming, across, nigeria, one, of, the, largest, of, which, was, the, peoples, democratic, party, pdp, an, umbrella, group, that, sought, to, be, sufficiently, broad, that, if, in, power, it, would, deter, future, coups, prominent, pdp, members, proposed, obasanjo, as, an, ideal, presidential, candidate, they, felt, that, he, could, command, international, respect, and, that, as, a, military, figure, he, could, hold, the, country, together, against, future, coups, and, secessionist, movements, they, also, argued, that, nigeria, needed, a, southern, president, to, balance, out, its, previous, northern, leadership, and, that, obasanjo, had, proved, himself, as, a, southerner, who, had, no, partisan, prejudice, against, the, north, friends, and, family, urged, him, not, to, run, saying, that, he, would, damage, his, good, reputation, or, be, killed, obasanjo, appeared, reluctant, but, on, 28, october, he, joined, the, pdp, and, a, week, later, announced, that, he, was, putting, himself, forward, to, be, the, party, s, presidential, nominee, in, his, campaign, he, emphasized, his, desire, to, restore, what, he, deemed, the, legacy, of, good, governance, when, he, left, office, in, 1979, at, a, fundraising, dinner, he, gained, n356, million, of, which, n120, million, had, been, donated, by, industrialist, aliko, dangote, most, of, these, donations, came, from, military, men, and, the, new, business, class, he, toured, the, country, giving, speeches, and, seeking, audiences, with, influential, persons, courting, state, governors, was, a, significant, element, of, his, approach, his, campaign, overshadowed, that, of, his, main, rival, alex, ekwueme, who, was, widely, mistrusted, by, northerners, and, the, military, the, pdp, was, gaining, ground, in, nigeria, proving, the, most, successful, party, in, the, local, government, elections, of, december, 1998, the, state, elections, in, january, 1999, and, the, senate, and, house, of, representatives, elections, in, february, 1999, on, 14, february, 1999, a, pdp, convention, was, called, to, select, its, presidential, candidate, obasanjo, received, 1, 658,

presidential, election, took, place, on, 27, february, obasanjo, s, sole, opponent, was, the, app, s, olu, falae, about, a, quarter, of, those, eligible, to, vote, did, so, and, there, was, some, rigging, although, no, violence, the, official, tally, gave, obasanjo, 63, percent, of, the, vote, he, was, the, loser, in, all, six, states, of, his, native, yorubaland, after, having, it, exorcised, obasanjo, moved, into, the, presidential, complex, at, aso, rock, in, may, on, 29, may, he, took, the, presidential, oath, in, abuja, s, eagle, square, while, appointing, his, new, government, he, selected, an, even, number, of, ministers, from, the, north, and, south, of, nigeria, although, the, fact, that, a, majority, were, christian, upset, some, muslim, northerners, critics, generally, characterised, obasanjo, s, cabinet, as, being, too, old, and, conservative, as, well, as, lacking, in, experience, especially, when, dealing, with, economic, matters, during, his, first, administration, the, levels, of, freedom, experienced, by, nigerians, increased, freedom, of, the, press, allowed, for, considerable, criticism, of, the, president, in, the, initial, months, of, his, presidency, obasanjo, retired, around, 200, military, officers, including, all, 93, who, held, political, positions, thus, making, a, coup, by, experienced, officers, less, likely, he, also, moved, the, defence, ministry, from, lagos, to, abuja, ensuring, it, was, brought, under, more, direct, government, control, obasanjo, was, re, elected, in, a, tumultuous, 2003, election, that, had, violent, ethnic, and, religious, overtones, his, main, opponent, fellow, former, military, ruler, general, muhammadu, buhari, was, muslim, and, drew, his, support, mainly, from, the, north, capturing, 61, 8, of, the, vote, obasanjo, defeated, buhari, by, more, than, 11, million, votes, in, november, 2003, obasanjo, was, criticized, for, his, decision, to, grant, asylum, to, the, deposed, liberian, president, charles, taylor, on, 12, june, 2006, he, signed, the, greentree, agreement, with, cameroonian, president, paul, biya, which, formally, put, an, end, to, the, bakassi, peninsula, border, dispute, even, though, the, nigerian, senate, passed, a, resolution, declaring, that, the, withdrawal, of, nigerian, troops, from, the, bakassi, peninsula, was, illegal, obasanjo, gave, the, order, for, it, to, continue, as, planned, in, his, second, term, obasanjo, continued, to, ensure, the, expansion, of, the, country, s, police, force, which, rose, to, 325, 000, in, 2007, ongoing, rural,

months, of, military, rule, on, 22, august, 2005, the, then, governor, of, abia, state, orji, uzor, kalu, submitted, a, petition, alleging, corrupt, practices, against, obasanjo, to, the, efcc,

a, political, media, uproar, in, nigeria, and, the, bill, was, not, ratified, by, the, national, assembly, consequently, obasanjo, stepped, down, after, the, april, 2007, general, election, in, an, exclusive, interview, granted, to, channels, television, obasanjo, denied, involvement, in, what, has, been, defined, as, third, term, agenda, he, said, that, it, was, the, national, assembly, that, included, tenure, elongation, amongst, the, other, clauses, of, the, constitution, of, nigeria, that, were, to, be, amended, obasanjo, stated, i, never, toyed, with, the, idea, of, a, third, term,

about, the, agenda, shortly, after, he, became, senate, president, he, said, immediately, i, became, senate, president, he, told, me, of, his, intentions, and, told, me, how, he, wanted, to, achieve, it, i, initially, did, not, take, him, seriously, until, the, events, began, to, unfold, he, also, insinuated, that, eight, billion, naira, was, spent, to, corrupt, legislators, to, support, the, agenda, asking, how, can, someone, talk, like, this, that, he, didn, t, know, about, it, yet, money, both, in, local, and, foreign, currencies, exchanged, hands, femi, gbajabiamila, corroborated, nnamani, s, account, but, put, the, figure, differently, stating, the, money, totaled, over, n10, billion, how, could, n10bn, be, taken, out, of, the, national, treasury, for, a, project, when, you, were, the, sitting, president, yet, that, project, was, not, your, idea, where, did, the, money, come, from, in, the, following, quotes, nnamani, said, us, president, george, w, bush, warned, obasanjo, to, desist, from, his, plan, to, contest, presidential, election, for, the, third, term, he, commented, if, you, want, to, be, convinced, that, the, man, is, only, telling, a, lie, pick, up, a, copy, of, the, book, written, by, condoleezza, rice, a, former, us, secretary, of, state, it, is, actually, an, autobiography, by, rice, on, page, 628, or, page, 638, she, discussed, obasanjo, s, meeting, with, bush, how, he, told, the, former, american, president, that, he, wanted, to, see, how, he, could, amend, the, constitution, so, that, he, could, go, for, a, third, term, to, his,

to, the, state, of, origin, from, 3, to, 13, percent, before, obasanjo, s, administration, nigeria, s, gdp, growth, had, been, painfully, slow, since, 1987, and, only, managed, 3, percent, between, 1999, and, 2000, however, under, obasanjo, the, growth, rate, doubled, to, 6, percent, until, he, left, office, helped, in, part, by, higher, oil, prices, nigeria, s, foreign, reserves, rose, from, 2, billion, in, 1999, to, 43, billion, on, leaving, office, in, 2007, he, was, able, to, secure, debt, pardons, from, the, paris, and, london, club, amounting, to, some, 18, billion, and, paid, another, 18, billion, to, be, debt, free, most, of, these, loans, were, accumulated, from, short, term, trade, arrears, during, the, exchange, control, period, point, of, correction, most, of, these, loans, were, accumulated, not, out, of, corruption, but, during, a, period, 1982, 85, when, nigeria, operated, exchange, control, regime, that, vested, all, foreign, exchange, transactions, on, the, central, bank, of, nigeria, when, obasanjo, took, office, nigeria, s, economy, was, in, a, poor, state, inflation, had, averaged, about, 30, a, year, throughout, the, 1990s, and, by, 2001, around, 20, of, nigerian, adults, were, unemployed, poverty, was, widespread, with, obasanjo, s, government, seeking, to, alleviate, this, by, paying, n3, 500, a, month, to, around, 200, 000, people, to, conduct, routine, tasks, such, as, sweeping, and, mending, roads, this, project, was, then, replaced, with, a, national, poverty, eradication, programme, which, focused, on, generating, youth, employment, rural, infrastructure, and, conservation, in, 2000, obasanjo, s, government, doubled, the, legal, minimum, wage, he, invited, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, to, review, nigeria, s, economy, and, offer, advice, on, how, to, improve, it, they, warned, that, the, government, was, overspending, in, 2001, obasanjo, declared, himself, a, believer, in, market, efficiency, and, related, that, he, had, seen, the, damage, caused, by, public, sector, mismanagement, first, hand, however, while, expressing, his, commitment, to, the, washington, consensus, of, free, markets, privatisation, and, limited, state, expenditure, government, expenditure, as, a, share, of, gdp, rose, from, 29, in, 1997, to, 50, in, 2001, in, january, 2000, nigeria, received, a, us, 1, billion, stand, by, loan, which, allowed, the, government, to, enter, debt, rescheduling, negotiations, with, its, creditors, obasanjo, s, government, benefited, from, high, international, oil, prices, during, his, first, presidential, term, it, planned, both, to, increase, nigeria, s, oil, output, and, to, produce, increasing, quantities, of, liquefied, natural, gas, which, was, first, exported, from, the, country, in, 1999, obasanjo, was, determined, to, abolish, the, petrol, subsidy, increasing, prices, to, commercial, rates, the, nigerian, labour, congress, called, a, general, strike, in, protest, for, june, 2000, and, obasanjo, ultimately, compromised, reducing, the, subsidy, rather, than, abolishing, it, this, situation, allowed, obasanjo, to, be, portrayed, as, an, enemy, of, the, poor, on, the, public, imagination, to, further, reduce, expenditure, obasanjo, turned, to, privatisation, forming, a, national, council, on, privatisation, in, july, 1999, when, he, took, office, nigeria, s, federal, government, owned, 588, public, enterprises, accounting, for, over, 55, of, external, debt, and, obasanjo, hoped, that, many, of, these, although, not, those, involved, in, oil, production, could, be, sold, off, privatisation, was, not, popular, with, nigeria, s, population, having, only, 35, support, according, to, a, 2000, opinion, survey, obasanjo, was, also, keen, to, negotiate, debt, reduction, he, insisted, that, nigeria, s, debts, were, so, large, as, to, be, unpayable, and, that, they, threatened, its, economy, and, democracy, although, canada, italy, and, the, u, s, cancelled, nigeria, s, debts, these, were, small, and, the, country, s, major, creditors, the, largest, of, which, was, the, uk, refused, obasanjo, blamed, many, of, nigeria, s, economic, problems, on, endemic, corruption, in, 2000, transparency, international, ranked, it, the, world, s, most, corrupt, country, several, days, after, taking, office, he, presented, an, anti, corruption, bill, to, the, national, assembly, although, this, aroused, much, opposition, from, critics, who, thought, it, gave, the, government, excessive, powers, compromises, were, reached, that, watered, down, obasanjo, s, proposals, allowing, him, to, sign, the, new, law, in, june, 2000, there, is, no, evidence, that, corruption, declined, in, nigeria, in, obasanjo, s, first, term, and, his, government, did, nothing, to, check, nigeria, s, endemic, low, level, corruption, which, was, widespread, at, the, state, and, local, government, levels, public, health, was, also, a, key, issue, in, nigeria, during, the, 1990s, nigeria, had, spent, about, 0, 2, of, its, gdp, on, public, health, services, the, joint, lowest, percentage, in, the, world, obasanjo, s, government, increased, this, to, over, 0, 4, the, most, urgent, health, crisis, impacting, nigeria, was, the, hiv, aids, epidemic, with, obasanjo, immediately, ordering, a, situation, report, on, the, topic, after, taking, office, he, then, established, a, presidential, committee, on, aids, which, he, headed, as, chair, and, created, a, national, action, plan, committee, to, prepare, a, campaign, for, 2000, 03, which, would, focus, on, publicity, training, counselling, and, testing, to, combat, the, virus, to, advance, public, health, more, broadly, he, launched, a, new, primary, care, campaign, that, used, local, government, funds, to, try, to, build, a, clinic, in, every, one, of, nigeria, s, 774, local, government, areas, one, of, obasanjo, s, major, tasks, in, which, he, succeeded, was, to, improve, nigeria, s, international, reputation, which, had, been, tarnished, under, abacha, he, spent, over, a, quarter, of, his, first, term, abroad, having, visited, 92, countries, by, october, 2002, in, october, 1999, obasanjo, launched, a, south, african, nigerian, bi, national, commission, to, discuss, cooperation, between, the, two, countries, the, largest, powers, on, sub, saharan, africa, obasanjo, retained, nigeria, s,

his, first, commonwealth, conference, in, november, 1999, and, hosted, that, in, december, 2003, where, he, received, an, honorary, knighthood, from, british, queen, elizabeth, ii, on, taking, office,

in, august, 2003, they, passed, into, a, un, command, two, months, later, obasanjo, granted, liberia, s, ousted, leader, charles, taylor, refuge, in, nigeria, although, subsequently, returned, him, to, liberia, to, face, trial, for, war, crimes, at, the, request, of, new, liberian, president, ellen, johnson, sirleaf, eager, to, keep, nigeria, out, of, domestically, unpopular, conflicts, he, refused, requests, for, the, nigerian, military, to, participate, in, an, ecomog, intervention, in, the, guinea, bissau, civil, war, and, the, 2002, peacekeeping, mission, to, the, c, te, d, ivoire,

mbeki, visited, zimbabwe, three, times, to, work, on, quiet, diplomacy, unsuccessfully, urging, mugabe, to, either, retire, or, form, a, power, sharing, government, with, the, opposition, movement, for, democratic, change, shortly, after, obasanjo, s, election, the, place, of, islamic, sharia, law, became, a, major, debate, in, nigerian, politics, since, the, country, s, independence, sharia, had, been, restricted, to, civil, cases, between, muslims, in, the, northern, states, criminal, cases, were, not, governed, by, sharia, law, something, that, offended, some, muslims, in, september, 1999, the, governor, of, zamfara, state, ahmed, sani, announced, the, full, introduction, of, sharia, as, the, basis, of, that, state, s, penal, code, although, specified, that, it, would, only, apply, to, muslim, residents, and, not, the, non, islamic, minority, this, sparked, alarm, among, christian, minorities, across, northern, nigeria, with, protests, and, counter, protests, generating, violence, especially, in, kaduna, across, nigeria, christian, opinion, was, very, hostile, to, the, introduction, of, sharia, as, the, basis, of, state, penal, systems, both, houses, of, the, national, assembly, urged, obasanjo, to, take, the, issue, to, the, supreme, court, he, was, eager, to, avoid, this, not, wanting, the, role, of, sharia, to, become, a, constitutional, issue, publicly, he, sought, to, distinguish, what, he, called, genuine, sharia, from, political, sharia, praising, the, former, while, insisting, that, the, latter, was, a, fad, that, would, fizzle, out, by, refusing, to, intervene, obasanjo, drew, criticism, for, a, lack, of, courage, from, many, southerners, while, muslim, hardliners, in, the, north, mocked, him, amid, popular, demand, from, muslim, communities, four, more, northern, states, adopted, sharia, penal, law, in, 2000, and, seven, more, in, 2001, obasanjo, later, stated, that, the, issue, was, the, biggest, challenge, he, ever, faced, as, president, when, obasanjo, came, to, power, he, was, appalled, that, nigeria, was, experiencing, widespread, unrest, and, violence, resulting, in, thousands, of, deaths, this, violence, was, being, exacerbated, by, a, rapidly, growing, population, which, brought, with, it, spiralling, urbanisation, and, competition, for, scarce, land, in, rural, areas, to, deal, with, this, obasanjo, doubled, the, country, s, police, force, from, 120, 000, to, 240, 000, between, 1999, and, 2003, little, was, done, to, deal, with, police, brutality, with, the, torture, of, suspects, remaining, widespread, under, obasanjo, s, administration, also, fuelling, the, violence, were, ethnic, tensions, with, different, ethnic, and, regional, groups, calling, for, greater, autonomy, leading, various, commentators, to, predict, the, breakup, of, nigeria, for, obasanjo, keeping, the, country, united, became, a, major, priority, only, on, select, occasions, would, he, turn, to, the, military, to, quell, unrest, preferring, not, to, have, to, mobilise, the, army, unless, state, governors, requested, it, in, his, words, we, must, utilise, military, force, only, when, all, else, has, failed, that, is, my, own, principle, and, philosophy, he, saw, greater, value, in, forgiveness, amnesty, and, reconciliation, to, achieve, harmony, than, in, retributive, criminal, justice, of, perpetrators, under, obasanjo, s, presidency, the, levels, of, violence, and, disorder, in, nigeria, declined, a, major, hub, of, secessionist, sentiment, was, in, the, niger, delta, region, where, indigenous, groups, wanted, to, retain, a, far, greater, proportion, of, the, proceeds, from, the, area, s, lucrative, oil, reserves, in, july, 1999, obasanjo, sent, the, national, assembly, a, bill, to, create, a, niger, delta, development, commission, to, formulate, and, implement, a, plan, for, dealing, with, the, region, something, he, hoped, would, quell, violence, there, amid, much, debate, the, commission, was, finally, launched, in, december, 2000, in, november, 1999, he, also, sent, two, army, battalions, into, the, niger, delta, region, to, apprehend, the, asawana, boys, an, ijaw, group, who, had, captured, and, killed, police, officers, in, odi, bayelsa, state, the, military, destroyed, most, of, the, town, the, government, claimed, that, 43, had, been, killed, but, a, local, ngo, put, the, number, of, civilian, deaths, at, 2, 483, obasanjo, described, the, destruction, as, avoidable, and, regrettable, and, visited, odi, in, march, 2001, he, refused, to, condemn, the, army, apologise, for, the, destruction, pay, compensation, or, rebuild, the, town, although, the, niger, delta, development, commission, did, the, latter, in, 2000, obasanjo, banned, the, oodua, peoples, congress, opc, a, yoruba, nationalist, group, involved, in, violence, against, other, ethnicities, and, ordered, the, arrest, of, its, leaders, in, september, 2001, violence, between, indigenous, christians, and, northern, muslim, traders, in, plateau, state, resulted, in, around, 500, deaths, before, the, army, moved, in, and, regained, control, obasanjo, then, visited, and, urged, reconciliation, in, october, 2001, muslim, demonstrators, in, kano, killed, around, 200, igbo, in, response, to, nigeria, s, support, for, the, u, s, bombing, of, afghanistan, obasanjo, then, visited, to, urge, reconciliation, but, was, booed, by, residents, also, in, october, soldiers, had, been, sent, to, calm, tensions, between, the, jukun, and, tiv, communities, along, the, borders, between, benue, and, taraba, states, a, tiv, militia, then, captured, and, killed, them, in, zaki, biam, obasanjo, ordered, the, army, in, where, they, rounded, up, and, killed, as, many, as, 250, to, 300, local, men, obasanjo, visited, the, area, in, 2002, and, apologised, for, the, excessive, use, of, force, in, january, 2002, obasanjo, ordered, the, mobile, police, to, break, up, the, bakassi, boys, a, vigilante, group, active, primarily, in, abia, and, anambra, states, which, was, responsible, for, an, estimated, two, thousand, killings, he, had, hesitated, doing, so, before, due, to, the, popular, support, that, the, group, had, accrued, through, fighting, criminal, gangs, but, felt, able, to, move, against, them, after, their, popularity, waned, that, same, month, an, ammunition, dump, at, the, ijeka, barracks, near, lagos, exploded, potentially, resulting, in, as, many, as, a, thousand, deaths, obasanjo, visited, immediately, violent, unrest, had, also, continued, in, lagos, and, in, february, 2002, troops, were, sent, into, the, city, to, restore, stability, in, april, 2002, obasanjo, proposed, legislation, that, would, allow, for, the, proscription, of, ethnic, based, groups, if, they, were, deemed, to, promote, violence, but, the, national, executive, rejected, this, as, an, overreach, of, presidential, power, some, public, officials, like, the, speaker, of, the, house, of, representatives, and, president, of, the, senate, were, involved, in, conflicts, with, the, president, who, battled, many, impeachment, attempts, from, both, houses, obasanjo, managed, to, survive, impeachment, and, was, renominated, he, became, chairman, of, the, pdp, board, of, trustees, with, control, over, nominations, for, governmental, positions, and, even, policy, and, strategy, as, one, western, diplomat, said, he, intends, to, sit, in, the, passenger, seat, giving, advice, and, ready, to, grab, the, wheel, if, nigeria, goes, off, course, he, voluntarily, resigned, as, the, chairman, board, of, trustees, of, the, pdp, in, april, 2012, afterwards, he, withdrew, from, political, activities, with, pdp, in, march, 2008, obasanjo, was, supposedly, indicted, by, a, committee, of, the, nigerian, parliament, for, awarding, 2, 2bn, worth, of, energy, contracts, during, his, eight, year, rule, without, due, process, the, report, of, this, probe, was, never, accepted, by, the, whole, nigerian, parliament, due, to, manipulation, of, the, entire, process, by, the, leadership, of, the, power, probe, committee, it, is, not, on, any, official, record, that, chief, obasanjo, was, indicted, in, may, 2014, obasanjo, wrote, to, president, goodluck, jonathan, requesting, that, he, should, mediate, on, behalf, of, the, nigerian, government, for, the, release, of, the, chibok, girls, held, by, the, boko, haram, militants, on, 16, february, 2015, he, quit, the, ruling, party, and, directed, a, pdp, ward, leader, to, tear, his, membership, card, during, a, press, conference, he, was, later, to, be, known, as, the, navigator, of, the, newly, formed, opposition, party, the, apc, on, 24, january, 2018, he, wrote, serving, president, muhammadu, buhari, highlighting, his, areas, of, weakness, and, advising, him, not, to, run, for, office, in, 2019, to, date, all, his, letters, to, incumbent, presidents, have, preceded, their, downfall, on, 31, january, 2018, his, political, movement, called, coalition, for, nigeria, movement, cnm, was, launched, in, abuja, on, 10, may, 2018, the, movement, adopts, a, political, party, african, democratic, congress, adc, to,

launch, for, my, transition, hours, written, by, former, president, goodluck, jonathan, on, 22, january, 2022, obasanjo, declared, that, he, had, retired, from, partisan, politics, he, stated, this, after, receiving, national, delegates, of, the, peoples, democratic, party, in, his, residence, in, ota, ogun, state, nigeria, obasanjo, was, appointed, special, envoy, by, un, secretary, general, ban, ki, moon, to, the, war, torn, democratic, republic, of, the, congo, he, held, separate, meetings, with, drc, president, joseph, kabila, and, rebel, leader, laurent, nkunda, during, the, zimbabwean, election, of, july, 2013, obasanjo, headed, a, delegation, of, african, union, election, observers, in, 2022, obasanjo, mediated, peace, talks, between, the, ethiopian, government, and, the, tigray, people, s, liberation, front, under, the, auspices, of, the, african, union, culminating, in, a, ceasefire, of, the, tigray, war, on, 2, november, 2022, in, december, 2017, obasanjo, defended, his, ph, d, thesis, at, the, national, open, university, of, nigeria, noun, he, now, holds, a, ph, d, in, theology, that, was, about, two, years, after, he, completed, his, master, s, degree, in, the, same, course, ideologically, obasanjo, was, a, nigerian, nationalist, he, was, committed, to, a, form, of, nigerian, patriotism, and, the, belief, that, nigeria, should, be, retained, as, a, single, nation, state, rather, than, being, broken, up, along, ethnic, lines, in, 2001, he, stated, that, his, long, term, goal, was, the, nullification, of, all, forms, of, identification, except, nigerian, citizenship, he, argued, that, dismantling, nigeria, along, ethnic, lines, would, result, in, the, ethnic, cleansing, and, violence, that, had, been, seen, during, the, yugoslav, wars, of, the, 1990s, iliffe, argued, that, obasanjo, s, nigerian, nationalism, was, impacted, both, by, his, detachment, from, the, yoruba, elite, and, by, his, time, in, the, army, where, he, worked, alongside, soldiers, from, a, broad, range, of, ethnic, backgrounds, democracy, may, not, necessarily, ensure, rapid, economic, development, or, affluence, but, it, is, at, least, the, best, form, of, government, so, far, devised, that, ensures, reasonable, participation, by, majority, of, people, in, the, means, and, issues, that, concern, their, governance, democracy, is, the, option, which, the, governed, prefer, in, the, nigerian, situation, democracy, is, the, only, integrative, glue, that, can, bind, different, sub, national, groups, together, into, a, nation, with, common, destinies, equal, status, and, common, identity, on, a, permanent, basis, olusegun, obasanjo, on, democracy, 1990, iliffe, noted, that, an, emphasis, on, consensus, politics, was, a, guiding, principle, throughout, obasanjo, s, career, while, in, power, during, the, 1970s, obasanjo, expressed, criticism, of, institutionalized, opposition, to, the, government, in, his, view, this, was, profoundly, incongruent, with, most, african, political, culture, and, practice, instead, of, constantly, opposing, the, government, he, believed, that, opposition, parties, should, instead, offer, constructive, criticism, and, that, politicians, should, pursue, a, search, for, consensus, rather, than, engaging, in, constant, competition, he, thought, that, political, competition, had, a, destabilising, effect, that, was, particularly, dangerous, for, a, developing, country, such, as, nigeria, and, that, stability, should, be, preserved, frustrated, with, what, he, regarded, as, the, failures, of, representative, democratic, rule, during, the, early, 1980s, obasanjo, began, expressing, support, for, a, one, party, state, in, nigeria, he, nevertheless, insisted, that, this, one, party, state, must, facilitate, general, public, participation, in, governance, respect, human, rights, and, protect, freedom, of, expression, later, in, the, 1980s, he, warned, against, the, proposed, two, party, state, which, babangida, was, putting, forward, believing, that, while, babangida, envisioned, a, centre, left, and, centre, right, party, competing, against, each, other, it, would, inevitably, develop, into, one, party, representing, the, christian, south, and, the, other, representing, the, muslim, north, he, instead, argued, that, there, should, be, no, limit, on, the, number, of, political, parties, that, could, be, formed, although, suggested, that, if, this, could, not, occur, then, nigeria, should, become, a, one, party, state, amid, the, collapse, of, the, soviet, union, in, the, early, 1990s, and, the, subsequent, move, towards, multi, party, politics, across, africa, obasanjo, again, became, supportive, of, multi, party, systems, iliffe, noted, that, as, a, politician, obasanjo, displayed, an, open, minded, pragmatism, a, tactic, employed, by, obasanjo, at, various, points, was, to, deliberately, polarise, an, issue, so, as, to, rally, support, for, his, perspective, iliffe, thought, that, although, obasanjo, had, been, too, young, to, play, a, major, role, in, the, anti, colonialist, struggle, for, nigerian, independence, from, british, rule, he, was, marked, for, ever, by, the, optimism, and, dedication, of, the, independence, movement, in, office, obasanjo, s, task, was, to, ensure, that, nigeria, functioned, both, politically, and, economically, over, the, course, of, his, political, career, obasanjo, moved, from, the, belief, in, the, advantages, of, state, involvement, in, heavy, industry, which, was, common, in, the, 1970s, to, a, commitment, to, market, liberalism, that, had, become, dominant, in, the, 1990s, iliffe, thought, that, throughout, his, career, obasanjo, had, always, displayed, an, ambivalence, about, the, level, of, state, involvement, in, the, economy, his, general, attitude, was, that, poverty, was, caused, by, idleness, while, campaigning, for, the, 1999, presidential, election, obasanjo, called, himself, a, market, oriented, social, democrat, although, was, vague, on, his, proposed, economic, strategy, during, his, presidency, his, government, brought, together, figures, who, were, committed, to, free, markets, who, favoured, more, protectionist, economic, strategies, and, those, sympathetic, to, socialism, obasanjo, was, contemptuous, of, ideological, arguments, about, capitalism, and, socialism, the, decisions, he, took, were, usually, based, on, political, considerations, rather, than, on, legal, or, constitutional, principles, something, which, was, a, source, of, concern, for, some, of, his, critics, derfler, thought, that, during, his, first, term, in, office, obasanjo, was, a, cautious, reformer, obasanjo, lived, a, polygamous, lifestyle, obasanjo, married, his, first, wife, oluremi, akinlawon, in, london, in, 1963, she, gave, birth, to, his, first, child, iyabo, in, 1967, iyabo, had, a, close, relationship, with, her, father, oluremi, was, unhappy, that, obasanjo, maintained, relationships, with, other, women, and, alleged, that, he, beat, her, they, divorced, in, the, mid, 1970s, that, decade, obasanjo, began, a, common, law, relationship, with, nta, reporter, gold, oruh, who, bore, him, two, children, he, married, his, second, wife, stella, abebe, in, 1976, having, met, her, on, a, visit, to, london, he, married, stella, in, 1976, and, they, had, three, children, obasanjo, s, other, partners, include, businesswoman, lynda, soares, who, was, murdered, by, car, thieves, in, 1986, on, 23, october, 2005, the, president, lost, his, wife, stella, obasanjo, first, lady, of, nigeria, after, she, died, following, an, abdominoplasty, in, spain, in, 2009, the, doctor, known, only, as, am, was, sentenced, to, one, year, in, jail, for, negligence, in, spain, and, ordered, to, pay, restitution, to, her, son, of, about, 176, 000, he, was, largely, private, about, his, relationships, with, these, women, some, of, his, children, were, resentful, that, he, gave, them, no, special, privileges, and, treated, their, mothers, poorly, one, of, his, sons, adeboye, obasanjo, is, a, brigadier, general, in, the, nigerian, army, ethnically, obasanjo, is, yoruba, a, cultural, identification, he, reflected, in, his, speech, and, choice, of, clothing, however, he, always, foregrounded, his, nigerian, identity, above, his, yoruba, one, repeatedly, stating, that, i, am, a, nigerian, who, happens, to, be, a, yoruba, man, i, am, not, a, yoruba, man, who, happens, to, be, a, nigerian, throughout, his, life, he, expressed, a, preference, for, rural, over, urban, life, he, has, been, a, lifelong, teetotaller, he, has, been, characterised, as, having, a, sense, of, discipline, and, duty, and, emphasised, what, he, saw, as, the, importance, of, leadership, he, was, meticulous, at, planning, and, iliffe, called, him, an, instinctively, cautious, man, obasanjo, always, emphasised, the, importance, of, deferring, to, seniority, a, value, he, had, learned, in, childhood, iliffe, described, obasanjo, as, a, man, with, great, physical, and, intellectual, energy, who, exercised, power, with, skill, and, ruthlessness, sometimes, unscrupulously, but, seldom, cruelly, derfler, similarly, stated, that, although, obasanjo, could, appear, boorish, and, dull, he, had, a, sharply, perceptive, mind, and, the, capacity, to, be, tough, and, ruthless, he, had, according, to, iliffe, a, remarkable, capacity, for, work, he, was, cautious, with, money, living, modestly, and, seeking, financial, security, by, investing, in, property, he, is, softly, spoken, in, his, sixties, obasanjo, would, regularly, work, 18, to, 20, hour, days, getting, very, little, sleep, he, would, start, each, day, with, prayers, obasanjo, suffers, from, diabetes, and, high, blood, pressure, he, enjoyed, playing, squash, obasanjo, s, writings, after, his, imprisonment, reflected, his, commitment, to, biblical, literalism, he, called, the, darwinian, theory, of, evolution, a, debasing, devaluing, and, dehumanising, idea, after, his, release, from, prison, his, writings, placed, far, less, emphasis, on, traditional, culture, as, a, guide, to, morality, calling, on, fellow, nigerians, to, reject, much, of, their, pre, christian, way, of, life, iliffe, noted, that, obasanjo, s, born, again, christianity, was, strikingly, orthodox, and, was, aligned, with, orthodox, pentecostal, teaching, he, rejected, the, prosperity, gospel, that, was, taught, by, some, pentecostalists, in, nigeria, providentialism, also, became, a, key, part, of, his, worldview, after, his, imprisonment, in, addition, to, a, variety, of, other, chieftaincy, titles, chief, obasanjo, is, the, holder, of, the, title, of, the, olori, omo, ilu, of, ibogun, olaogun, a, number, of, other, members, of, his, family, hold, or, have, held, chieftaincies, as, well, john, iliffe, described, obasanjo, as, the, outstanding, member, of, the, second, generation, of, independent, african, leaders, who, dedicated, themselves, to, the, consolidation, of, their, postcolonial, states, he, thought, that, there, were, four, major, achievements, of, obasanjo, s, presidency, that, he, partially, contained, the, domestic, turmoil, permeating, nigeria, that, he, kept, control, of, the, military, that, he, helped, to, form, the, african, union, and, that, he, liquidated, the, country, s, external, debt, in, december, 1999, his, approval, rating, was, at, 84, by, 2001, it, was, at, 72, and, by, september, 2003, it, had, fallen, to, 39, obasanjo, was, repeatedly, accused, of, corruption, throughout, his, career, although, he, himself, maintained, that, his, dealings, were, honest, obasanjo, s, critics, believed, that, after, his, imprisonment, in, the, 1990s, he, increasingly, perceived, himself, as, a, messianic, figure, having, lost, his, humility, and, become, increasingly, committed, to, the, belief, that, it, was, his, god, commanded, destiny, to, rule, nigeria, obasanjo, s, critics, believed, that, he, had, been, corrupted, by, power, and, that, particularly, during, his, second, term, in, office, he, became, driven, by, the, idea, of, indefinitely, retaining, power, for, himself, during, his, first, term, as, head, of, state, he, earned, some, enmity, from, fellow, yoruba, who, believed, that, he, should, have, done, more, to, advance, the, interests, of, his, own, ethnic, group, in, government, after, his, imprisonment, obasanjo, claimed, that, criticism, only, served, to, confirm, the, rightness, of, my, cause, and, demonstrated, his, critics, depravity, in, a, fallen, and, perverted, world
