for, peace, lower, taxes, and, growing, exports, and, allowed, a, little, more, tolerance, for, protestant, dissenters, he, mostly, avoided, controversy, and, high, intensity, disputes, as, his, middle, way, attracted, moderates, from, both, the, whig, and, tory, camps, but, his, appointment, to, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, after, the, south, sea, bubble, stock, market, crisis, drew, attention, to, perceived, protection, of, political, allies, by, walpole, historian, h, t, dickinson, sums, up, his, historical, role, by, saying, that, walpole, was, one, of, the, greatest, politicians, in, british, history, he, played, a, significant, role, in, sustaining, the, whig, party, safeguarding, the, hanoverian, succession, and, defending, the, principles, of, the, glorious, revolution, 1688, he, established, stable, political, supremacy, for, the, whig, party, and, taught, succeeding, ministers, how, best, to, establish, an, effective, working, relationship, between,

january, 1711, harley, had, first, attempted, to, entice, him, and, then, threatened, him, to, join, the, tories, but, walpole, rejected, the, offers, instead, becoming, one, of, the, most, outspoken, members, of, the, whig, opposition, he, effectively, defended, lord, godolphin, against, tory, attacks, in, parliamentary, debate, as, well, as, in, the, press, in, 1712, walpole, was, accused, of,

and, james, stanhope, later, 1st, earl, stanhope, walpole, was, also, appointed, chairman, of, a, secret, committee, formed, to, investigate, the, actions, of, the, previous, tory, ministry, in, 1715,

positions, and, encouraged, by, his, advisers, walpole, introduced, the, sinking, fund, a, device, to, reduce, the, national, debt, the, cabinet, of, which, he, was, a, member, was, often, divided, over, most, important, issues, normally, walpole, and, townshend, were, on, one, side, with, stanhope, and, charles, spencer, 3rd, earl, of, sunderland, on, the, other, foreign, policy, was, the, primary, issue, of, contention, george, i, was, thought, to, be, conducting, foreign, affairs, with, the, interests, of, his, german, territories, rather, than, those, of, great, britain, at, heart, the, stanhope, sunderland, faction, however, had, the, king, s, support, in, 1716, townshend, had, been, removed, from, the, important, post, of, northern, secretary, and, put, in, the, lesser, office, of, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, even, this, change, did, not, appease, stanhope, and, sunderland, who, secured, the, dismissal, of, townshend, from, the, lord, lieutenancy, in, april, 1717, on, the, next, day, walpole, resigned, from, the, cabinet, to, join, the, opposition, because, i, could, not, connive, at, some, things, that, were, carrying, on, and, by, joining, the, opposition, he, did, not, intend, to, make, the, king, uneasy, or, to, embarrass, his, affairs, this, began, the, whig, split, dividing, the, dominant, party, for, three, years, in, the, new, cabinet, sunderland, and, stanhope, who, was, created, an, earl, were, the, effective, heads, walpole, reversed, his, earlier, support, for, the, impeachment, of, robert, harley, the, former, first, minister, and, joined, with, the, tory, opposition, in, securing, an, acquittal, in, july, 1717, soon, after, walpole, s, resignation, a, bitter, family, quarrel, between, the, king, and, the, prince, of, wales, split, the, royal, family, walpole, and, others, who, opposed, the, government, often, congregated, at, leicester, house, the, home, of, the, prince, of, wales, to, form, political, plans, walpole, also, became, an, adviser, and, close, friend, of, the, prince, of, wales, s, wife, caroline, in, 1720, he, improved, his, position, by, bringing, about, a, reconciliation, between, the, prince, of, wales, and, the, king, walpole, continued, to, be, an, influential, figure, in, the, house, of, commons, he, was, especially, active, in, opposing, one, of, the, government, s, more, significant, proposals, the, peerage, bill, which, would, have, limited, the, power, of, the, monarch, to, create, new, peerages, walpole, brought, about, a, temporary, abandonment, of, the, bill, in, 1719, and, the, outright, rejection, of, the, bill, by, the, house, of, commons, this, defeat, led, stanhope, and, sunderland, to, reconcile, with, their, opponents, walpole, returned, as, paymaster, of, the, forces, and, townshend, was, appointed, lord, president, of, the, council, by, accepting, the, position, of, paymaster, however, walpole, lost, the, favour, of, the, prince, of, wales, the, future, king, george, ii, who, still, harboured, disdain, for, his, father, s, government, soon, after, walpole, returned, to, the, cabinet, britain, was, swept, by, a, wave, of, over, enthusiastic, speculation, which, led, to, the, south, sea, bubble, the, government, had, established, a, plan, whereby, the, south, sea, company, would, assume, the, national, debt, of, great, britain, in, exchange, for, lucrative, bonds, it, was, widely, believed, that, the, company, would, eventually, reap, an, enormous, profit, through, international, trade, in, cloth, agricultural, goods, and, slaves, many, in, the, country, including, walpole, himself, who, sold, at, the, top, of, the, market, and, made, 1, 000, per, cent, profit, frenziedly, invested, in, the, company, by, the, latter, part, of, 1720, however, the, company, had, begun, to, collapse, as, the, price, of, its, shares, plunged, in, 1721, a, committee, investigated, the, scandal, finding, that, there, was, corruption, on, the, part, of, many, in, the, cabinet, among, those, implicated, were, john, aislabie, the, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, james, craggs, the, elder, the, postmaster, general, james, craggs, the, younger, the, southern, secretary, and, even, lords, stanhope, and, sunderland, the, heads, of, the, ministry, both, craggs, the, elder, and, craggs, the, younger, died, in, disgrace, the, remainder, were, impeached, for, their, corruption, aislabie, was, found, guilty, and, imprisoned, but, the, personal, influence, of, walpole, saved, both, stanhope, and, sunderland, for, his, role, in, preventing, these, individuals, and, others, from, being, punished, walpole, gained, the, nickname, of, the, screen, or, screenmaster, general, the, resignation, of, sunderland, and, the, death, of, stanhope, in, 1721, left, walpole, as, the, most, important, figure, in, the, administration, on, 3, april, 1721, he, was, appointed, first, lord, of, the, treasury, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, and, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, walpole, s, de, facto, tenure, as, prime, minister, is, often, dated, to, his, appointment, as, first, lord, of, the, treasury, in, 1721, though, he, himself, rejected, that, title, it, was, originally, a, term, of, abuse, stating, in, 1741, i, unequivocally, deny, that, i, am, sole, and, prime, minister, his, brother, in, law, lord, townshend, served, as, secretary, of, state, for, the, northern, department, and, controlled, the, nation, s, foreign, affairs, the, two, also, had, to, contend, with, the, secretary, of, state, for, the, southern, department, lord, carteret, townshend, and, walpole, were, thus, restored, to, power, and, annihilated, the, opposing, faction, under, the, guidance, of, walpole, parliament, attempted, to, deal, with, the, financial, crisis, brought, on, by, the, south, sea, bubble, the, estates, of, the, directors, of, the, south, sea, company, were, used, to, relieve, the, suffering, of, the, victims, and, the, stock, of, the, company, was, divided, between, the, bank, of, england, and, east, india, company, the, crisis, had, gravely, damaged, the, credibility, of, the, king, and, of, the, whig, party, but, walpole, defended, both, with, skilful, oratory, in, the, house, of, commons, walpole, s, first, year, as, prime, minister, was, also, marked, by, the, discovery, of, a, plot, formed, by, francis, atterbury, the, bishop, of, rochester, the, exposure, of, the, scheme, crushed, the, hopes, of, the, jacobites, whose, previous, attempts, at, rebellion, most, notably, the, risings, of, 1715, and, 1719, had, also, failed, the, tory, party, was, equally, unfortunate, even, though, lord, bolingbroke, a, tory, leader, who, fled, to, france, to, avoid, punishment, for, his, jacobite, sympathies, was, permitted, to, return, to, britain, in, 1723, during, the, remainder, of, george, i, s, reign, walpole, s, ascendancy, continued, the, political, power, of, the, monarch, was, gradually, diminishing, and, that, of, his, ministers, gradually, increasing, in, 1724, the, primary, political, rival, of, walpole, and, townshend, in, the, cabinet, lord, carteret, was, dismissed, from, the, post, of, southern, secretary, and, once, again, appointed, to, the, lesser, office, of, lord, lieutenant, of, ireland, in, ireland, lord, carteret, used, his, power, to, secretly, aid, in, the, controversy, over, wood, s, halfpence, and, support, drapier, s, letters, behind, the, scenes, and, cause, harm, to, walpole, s, power, walpole, was, able, to, recover, from, these, events, by, removing, the, patent, however, irish, sentiment, was, situated, against, the, english, control, townshend, working, with, the, king, helped, keep, great, britain, at, peace, especially, by, negotiating, a, treaty, with, france, and, prussia, in, 1725, walpole, was, not, consulted, and, stated, that, townshend, was, too, precipitate, in, his, actions, great, britain, free, from, jacobite, threats, from, war, and, from, financial, crises, grew, prosperous, and, robert, walpole, acquired, the, favour, of, george, i, in, 1725, he, persuaded, the, king, to, revive, the, knighthood, of, the, bath, and, was, himself, invested, with, the, order, and, in, 1726, was, made, a, knight, of, the, garter, earning, him, the, nickname, sir, bluestring, his, eldest, son, was, granted, a, barony, walpole, s, position, was, threatened, in, 1727, when, george, i, died, and, was, succeeded, by, george, ii, for, a, few, days, it, seemed, that, walpole, would, be, dismissed, but, on, the, advice, of, queen, caroline, the, king, agreed, to, keep, him, in, office, although, the, king, disliked, townshend, he, retained, him, as, well, over, the, next, years, walpole, continued, to, share, power, with, townshend, but, the, two, clashed, over, british, foreign, affairs, especially, over, policy, regarding, austria, gradually, walpole, became, the, clearly, dominant, partner, in, government, his, colleague, retired, on, 15, may, 1730, and, this, date, is, sometimes, given, as, the, beginning, of, walpole, s, unofficial, tenure, as, prime, minister, townshend, s, departure, enabled, walpole, to, conclude, the, treaty, of, vienna, creating, the, anglo, austrian, alliance, walpole, a, polarising, figure, had, many, opponents, the, most, important, of, whom, were, in, the, country, party, such, as, lord, bolingbroke, who, had, been, his, political, enemy, since, the, days, of, queen, anne, and, william, pulteney, a, capable, whig, statesman, who, felt, snubbed, when, walpole, failed, to, include, him, in, the, cabinet, bolingbroke, and, pulteney, ran, a, periodical, called, the, craftsman, in, which, they, incessantly, denounced, the, prime, minister, s, policies, walpole, was, also, satirised, and, parodied, extensively, he, was, often, compared, to, the, criminal, jonathan, wild, as, for, example, john, gay, did, in, his, farcical, beggar, s, opera, walpole, s, other, enemies, included, jonathan, swift, alexander, pope, henry, fielding, and, samuel, johnson, walpole, secured, the, support, of, the, people, and, of, the, house, of, commons, with, a, policy, of, avoiding, war, he, used, his, influence, to, prevent, george, ii, from, entering, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, in, 1733, because, it, was, a, dispute, between, the, bourbons, and, the, habsburgs, he, boasted, there, are, 50, 000, men, slain, in, europe, this, year, and, not, one, englishman, by, avoiding, wars, walpole, could, lower, taxes, he, reduced, the, national, debt, with, a, sinking, fund, and, by, negotiating, lower, interest, rates, he, reduced, the, land, tax, from, four, shillings, in, 1721, to, 3s, in, 1728, 2s, in, 1731, and, finally, to, only, 1s, in, 1732, his, long, term, goal, was, to, replace, the, land, tax, which, was, paid, by, the, local, gentry, with, excise, and, customs, taxes, which, were, paid, by, merchants, and, ultimately, by, consumers, walpole, joked, that, the, landed, gentry, resembled, hogs, which, squealed, loudly, whenever, anyone, laid, hands, on, them, by, contrast, he, said, merchants, were, like, sheep, and, yielded, their, wool, without, complaint, the, joke, backfired, in, 1733, when, he, was, defeated, in, a, major, battle, to, impose, excise, taxes, on, wine, and, tobacco, to, reduce, the, threat, of, smuggling, the, tax, was, to, be, collected, not, at, ports, but, at, warehouses, this, new, proposal, however, was, extremely, unpopular, and, aroused, the, opposition, of, the, nation, s, merchants, walpole, agreed, to, withdraw, the, bill, before, parliament, voted, on, it, but, he, dismissed, the, politicians, who, had, dared, to, oppose, it, in, the, first, place, thus, walpole, lost, a, considerable, element, of, his, whig, party, to, the, opposition, pp, 28, 33, after, the, general, elections, of, 1734, walpole, s, supporters, still, formed, a, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, although, they, were, less, numerous, than, before, he, maintained, both, his, parliamentary, supremacy, and, his, popularity, in, norfolk, his, home, county, in, may, 1734, he, presented, a, new, silver, mace, weighing, 168, ounces, gilt, and, finely, exchased, to, the, city, of, norwich, on, the, cup, part, of, it, are, sir, robert, s, arms, and, the, arms, of, the, city, it, was, first, carried, before, mayor, philip, meadows, esq, on, the, 29th, of, may, however, despite, these, great, occasions, walpole, s, broader, popularity, had, begun, to, wane, in, 1736, an, increase, in, the, tax, on, gin, inspired, riots, in, london, the, even, more, serious, porteous, riots, broke, out, in, edinburgh, after, the, king, pardoned, a, captain, of, the, guard, john, porteous, who, had, commanded, his, troops, to, shoot, a, group, of, protesters, though, these, events, diminished, walpole, s, popularity, they, failed, to, shake, his, majority, in, parliament, walpole, s, domination, over, the, house, of, commons, was, highlighted, by, the, ease, with, which, he, secured, the, rejection, of, sir, john, barnard, s, plan, to, reduce, the, interest, on, the, national, debt, walpole, was, also, able, to, persuade, parliament, to, pass, the, licensing, act, of, 1737, under, which, london, theatres, were, regulated, the, act, revealed, a, disdain, for, swift, pope, fielding, and, other, literary, figures, who, had, attacked, his, government, in, their, works, while, the, country, party, attacked, walpole, relentlessly, he, subsidised, writers, and, lesser, known, journalists, such, as, william, arnall, and, bishop, benjamin, hoadly, as, well, as, two, men, he, named, to, the, role, of, poet, laureate, laurence, eusden, and, colley, cibber, they, defended, walpole, from, the, charge, of, evil, political, corruption, by, arguing, that, corruption, is, the, universal, human, condition, furthermore, they, argued, political, divisiveness, was, also, universal, and, inevitable, because, of, selfish, passions, that, were, integral, to, human, nature, arnall, argued, that, government, must, be, strong, enough, to, control, conflict, and, in, that, regard, walpole, was, quite, successful, this, style, of, court, political, rhetoric, continued, through, the, 18th, century, the, year, 1737, saw, the, death, of, walpole, s, close, friend, queen, caroline, though, her, death, did, not, end, his, personal, influence, with, george, ii, who, had, grown, loyal, to, the, prime, minister, during, the, preceding, years, walpole, s, domination, of, government, continued, to, decline, his, opponents, acquired, a, vocal, leader, in, the, prince, of, wales, who, was, estranged, from, his, father, the, king, several, young, politicians, including, william, pitt, the, elder, and, george, grenville, formed, a, faction, known, as, the, patriot, boys, and, joined, the, prince, of, wales, in, opposition, walpole, s, failure, to, maintain, a, policy, of, avoiding, military, conflict, eventually, led, to, his, fall, from, power, under, the, treaty, of, seville, 1729, great, britain, agreed, not, to, trade, with, the, spanish, colonies, in, north, america, spain, claimed, the, right, to, board, and, search, british, vessels, to, ensure, compliance, with, this, provision, disputes, however, broke, out, over, trade, with, the, west, indies, walpole, attempted, to, prevent, war, but, was, opposed, by, the, king, the, house, of, commons, and, by, a, faction, in, his, own, cabinet, in, 1739, walpole, abandoned, all, efforts, to, stop, the, conflict, and, commenced, the, war, of, jenkins, ear, so, called, because, robert, jenkins, a, welsh, mariner, claimed, that, a, spaniard, inspecting, his, vessel, had, severed, his, ear, walpole, s, influence, continued, to, dramatically, decline, even, after, the, war, began, in, the, 1741, general, election, his, supporters, secured, an, increase, in, votes, in, constituencies, that, were, decided, by, mass, electorates, but, failed, to, win, in, many, pocket, boroughs, constituencies, subject, to, the, informal, but, strong, influence, of, patrons, in, general, the, government, made, gains, in, england, and, wales, but, this, was, not, enough, to, overturn, the, reverses, of, the, 1734, election, and, further, losses, in, cornwall, where, many, constituencies, were, obedient, to, the, will, of, the, prince, of, wales, who, was, also, duke, of, cornwall, these, constituencies, returned, members, of, parliament, hostile, to, the, prime, minister, similarly, the, influence, of, the, duke, of, argyll, secured, the, election, of, members, opposed, to, walpole, in, some, parts, of, scotland, walpole, s, new, majority, was, difficult, to, determine, because, of, the, uncertain, loyalties, of, many, new, members, but, contemporaries, and, historians, estimated, it, as, low, as, fourteen, to, eighteen, in, the, new, parliament, many, whigs, thought, the, ageing, prime, minister, incapable, of, leading, the, military, campaign, moreover, his, majority, was, not, as, strong, as, it, had, formerly, been, his, detractors, such, as, william, pulteney, earl, of, bath, and, lord, perceval, being, approximately, as, numerous, as, his, supporters, behind, these, political, enemies, were, opposition, whigs, tories, and, jacobites, walpole, was, alleged, to, have, presided, over, an, immense, increase, in, corruption, and, to, have, enriched, himself, enormously, whilst, in, office, parliamentary, committees, were, formed, to, investigate, these, charges, in, 1742, when, the, house, of, commons, was, prepared, to, determine, the, validity, of, a, by, election, in, chippenham, walpole, and, others, agreed, to, treat, the, issue, as, a, motion, of, no, confidence, as, walpole, was, defeated, on, the, vote, he, agreed, to, resign, from, the, government, the, news, of, the, naval, disaster, against, spain, in, the, battle, of, cartagena, de, indias, also, prompted, the, end, of, his, political, career, king, george, ii, wept, on, his, resignation, and, begged, to, see, him, frequently, as, part, of, his, resignation, the, king, agreed, to, elevate, him, to, the, house, of, lords, as, the, earl, of, orford, viscount, walpole, and, baron, walpole, of, houghton, in, the, county, of, norfolk, this, occurred, on, 6, february, 1742, five, days, later, he, formally, relinquished, the, seals, of, office, p, 56, although, no, longer, first, lord, of, the, treasury, walpole, remained, politically, involved, as, an, advisor, his, former, colleagues, were, still, pleased, to, see, him, perhaps, in, part, because, he, retained, the, king, s, favour, after, his, resignation, his, main, political, roles, were, to, support, the, government, by, means, of, advice, to, dole, out, some, patronage, and, to, speak, on, the, ministry, s, behalf, in, the, lords, lord, orford, was, succeeded, as, prime, minister, by, lord, wilmington, in, an, administration, whose, true, head, was, lord, carteret, a, committee, was, created, to, inquire, into, walpole, s, ministry, but, no, substantial, evidence, of, wrongdoing, or, corruption, was, discovered, though, no, longer, a, member, of, the, cabinet, orford, continued, to, maintain, personal, influence, with, george, ii, and, was, often, dubbed, the, minister, behind, the, curtain, for, this, advice, and, influence, in, 1744, he, managed, to, secure, the, dismissal, of, carteret, and, the, appointment, of, henry, pelham, whom, he, regarded, as, a, political, prot, g, he, advised, pelham, to, make, use, of, his, seat, in, the, commons, to, serve, as, a, bridge, between, the, king, and, parliament, just, as, walpole, had, done, during, this, time, walpole, also, made, two, interventions, in, the, lords, the, first, was, in, january, 1744, in, the, debate, on, hanoverian, troops, being, kept, in, british, pay, walpole, prevented, them, from, losing, the, troops, in, his, second, intervention, walpole, with, fear, of, a, jacobite, inspired, invasion, in, february, 1744, made, a, speech, on, the, situation, frederick, prince, of, wales, usually, hostile, to, walpole, warmly, received, him, at, his, court, the, next, day, most, likely, because, his, father, s, throne, and, the, future, of, the, whole, hanoverian, dynasty, was, at, risk, from, the, stuart, pretender, along, with, his, political, interests, in, his, last, years, walpole, enjoyed, the, pleasures, of, the, hunt, back, at, his, recently, rebuilt, country, seat, in, houghton, norfolk, such, pastimes, were, denied, him, due, to, dismal, weather, he, also, enjoyed, the, beauties, of, the, countryside, his, art, collection, gave, him, particular, pleasure, he, had, spent, much, money, in, the, 1720s, and, 1730s, in, building, up, a, collection, of, old, masters, from, all, over, europe, walpole, also, concerned, himself, with, estate, matters, his, health, never, good, deteriorated, rapidly, toward, the, end, of, 1744, walpole, died, in, london, on, 18, march, 1745, from, a, bladder, stone, aged, 68, years, and, was, buried, at, the, church, of, st, martin, at, tours, on, the, haughton, estate, his, earldom, passed, to, his, eldest, son, robert, who, was, in, turn, succeeded, by, his, only, son, george, upon, the, death, of, the, third, earl, the, earldom, was, inherited, by, the, first, earl, s, younger, son, horace, walpole, who, is, now, remembered, for, his, many, thousands, of, insightful, letters, published, in, 48, volumes, by, yale, university, press, the, title, died, with, him, in, 1797, walpole, exercised, a, tremendous, influence, on, the, politics, of, his, day, the, tories, became, a, minor, insignificant, faction, and, the, whigs, became, a, dominant, and, largely, unopposed, party, his, influence, on, the, development, of, the, uncodified, constitution, of, great, britain, was, less, momentous, even, though, he, is, regarded, as, great, britain, s, first, prime, minister, he, relied, primarily, on, the, favour, of, the, king, rather, than, the, support, of, the, house, of, commons, his, power, stemmed, from, his, personal, influence, instead, of, the, influence, of, his, office, most, of, his, immediate, successors, were, comparatively, speaking, extremely, weak, it, would, take, several, decades, more, for, the, premiership, to, develop, into, the, most, powerful, and, most, important, office, in, the, country, walpole, s, strategy, of, keeping, great, britain, at, peace, contributed, greatly, to, the, country, s, prosperity, walpole, also, managed, to, secure, the, position, of, the, hanoverian, dynasty, and, effectively, countervailed, jacobitism, the, jacobite, threat, ended, soon, after, walpole, s, term, ended, with, the, defeat, of, the, rebellion, of, 1745, later, in, the, century, the, whig, mp, edmund, burke, admitted, him, into, the, whig, pantheon, burke, wrote, he, was, an, honorable, man, and, a, sound, whig, he, was, not, as, the, jacobites, and, discontented, whigs, of, his, time, have, represented, him, and, as, ill, informed, people, still, represent, him, a, prodigal, and, corrupt, minister, they, charged, him, in, their, libels, and, seditious, conversations, as, having, first, reduced, corruption, to, a, system, such, was, their, cant, but, he, was, far, from, governing, by, corruption, he, governed, by, party, attachments, the, charge, of, systematic, corruption, is, less, applicable, to, him, perhaps, than, to, any, minister, who, ever, served, the, crown, for, so, great, a, length, of, time, he, gained, over, very, few, from, the, opposition, without, being, a, genius, of, the, first, class, he, was, an, intelligent, prudent, and, safe, minister, he, loved, peace, and, he, helped, to, communicate, the, same, disposition, to, nations, at, least, as, warlike, and, restless, as, that, in, which, he, had, the, chief, direction, of, affairs, with, many, virtues, public, and, private, he, had, his, faults, but, his, faults, were, superficial, a, careless, coarse, and, over, familiar, style, of, discourse, without, sufficient, regard, to, persons, or, occasions, and, an, almost, total, want, of, political, decorum, were, the, errours, by, which, he, was, most, hurt, in, the, public, opinion, and, those, through, which, his, enemies, obtained, the, greatest, advantage, over, him, but, justice, must, be, done, the, prudence, steadiness, and, vigilance, of, that, man, joined, to, the, greatest, possible, lenity, in, his, character, and, his, politics, preserved, the, crown, to, this, royal, family, and, with, it, their, laws, and, liberties, to, this, country, lord, chesterfield, expressed, scepticism, as, to, whether, an, impartial, character, of, sr, robert, walpole, will, or, can, be, transmitted, to, posterity, for, he, governed, this, kingdom, so, long, that, the, various, passions, of, mankind, mingled, and, in, a, manner, incorporated, themselves, with, every, thing, that, was, said, or, writt, concerning, him, never, was, man, more, flattered, nor, more, abused, and, his, long, power, was, probably, the, chief, cause, of, both, chesterfield, claimed, he, was, much, acquainted, with, him, both, in, his, publick, and, his, private, life, in, private, life, he, was, good, natured, chearfull, social, inelegant, in, his, manners, loose, in, his, morals, he, had, a, coarse, wit, which, he, was, too, free, of, for, a, man, in, his, station, as, it, is, always, inconsistent, with, dignity, he, was, very, able, as, a, minister, but, without, a, certain, elevation, of, mind, he, was, both, the, ablest, parliament, man, and, the, ablest, manager, of, a, parliament, that, i, believe, ever, lived, money, not, prerogative, was, the, chief, engine, of, his, administration, and, he, employed, it, with, a, success, that, in, a, manner, disgraced, humanity, when, he, found, any, body, proof, against, pecuniary, temptations, which, alass, was, but, seldom, he, had, recourse, to, still, a, worse, art, for, he, laughed, at, and, ridiculed, all, notions, of, publick, virtue, and, the, love, of, one, s, country, calling, them, the, chimerical, school, boy, flights, of, classical, learning, declaring, himself, at, the, same, time, no, saint, no, spartan, no, reformer, he, would, frequently, ask, young, fellows, at, their, first, appearance, in, the, world, while, their, honest, hearts, were, yet, untainted, well, are, you, to, be, an, old, roman, a, patriot, you, will, soon, come, off, of, that, and, grow, wiser, and, thus, he, was, more, dangerous, to, the, morals, than, to, the, libertys, of, his, country, to, which, i, am, persuaded, that, he, meaned, no, ill, in, his, heart, his, name, will, not, be, recorded, in, history, among, the, best, men, or, the, best, ministers, but, much, much, less, ought, it, to, be, ranked, among, the, worst, 10, downing, street, represents, another, part, of, walpole, s, legacy,

residence, there, on, 22, september, 1735, his, immediate, successors, did, not, always, reside, in, number, 10, preferring, their, larger, private, residences, but, the, home, has, nevertheless,
