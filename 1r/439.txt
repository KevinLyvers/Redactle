the, protest, movement, to, further, their, own, ends, mishima, warned, against, the, dangers, of, the, japanese, people, following, ideologues, who, told, lies, with, honeyed, words, although, mishima, criticized, kishi, as, a, nihilist, who, had, subordinated, himself, to, the, united, states, mishima, concluded, that, he, would, rather, vote, for, a, strong, willed, realist, with, neither, dreams, nor, despair, than, a, mendacious, but, eloquent, ideologue, shortly, after, the, anpo, protests, ended, mishima, began, writing, one, of, his, most, famous, short, stories,

enjoyed, eating, local, seafood, with, his, friend, henry, scott, stokes, mishima, never, showed, any, hostility, towards, the, us, in, front, of, foreign, friends, like, scott, stokes, until, mishima, heard, that, the, name, of, the, inn, where, scott, stokes, was, staying, was, kurofune, lit, black, ship, at, which, point, his, voice, suddenly, became, low, and, he, said, in, a, sullen, manner, why, why, do, you, stay, at, a, place, with, such, a, name, mishima, liked, ordinary, american, people, after, the, war, and, he, and, his, wife, had, even, visited, disneyland, as, newlyweds, however, he, clearly, retained, a, strong, sense, of, hostility, toward, the, black, ships, of, commodore, matthew, c, perry, who, forcibly, opened, japan, up, to, unequal, international, relations, at, the, end, of, the, edo, period, and, had, destroyed, the, peace, of, edo, where, vivid, ch, nin, culture, was, flourishing, defunct, defunct, mishima, s, nationalism, grew, towards, the, end, of,

world, war, ii, he, argued, that, the, soldiers, who, had, died, in, the, february, 26, incident, and, the, japanese, special, attack, units, had, died, for, their, living, god, emperor, and, that, hirohito, s, renunciation, of, his, own, divinity, meant, that, all, those, deaths, had, been, in, vain, mishima, said, that, his, imperial, majesty, had, become, a, human, when, he, should, be, a,

and, what, he, felt, was, the, indian, people, s, determination, to, resist, westernization, and, protect, traditional, ways, mishima, feared, that, his, fellow, japanese, were, too, enamored, of, modernization, and, western, style, materialism, to, protect, traditional, japanese, culture, while, in, new, delhi, he, spoke, at, length, with, an, unnamed, colonel, in, the, indian, army, who, had, experienced, skirmishes, with, chinese, troops, on, the, sino, indian, border, the, colonel, warned, mishima, of, the, strength, and, fighting, spirit, of, the, chinese, troops, mishima, later, spoke, of, his, sense, of, danger, regarding, what, he, perceived, to, be, a, lack, of, concern, in, japan, about, the, need, to, bolster, japan, s, national, defense, against, the, threat, from, communist, china, on, his, way, home, from, india, mishima, also, stopped, in, thailand, and, laos, his, experiences, in, the, three, nations, became, the, basis, for, portions, of, his, novel, the, temple, of, dawn, the, third, in, his, tetralogy, the, sea, of, fertility, in, 1968, mishima, wrote, a, play, titled, my, friend, hitler, in, which, he, depicted, the, historical, figures, of, adolf, hitler, gustav, krupp, gregor, strasser, and, ernst, r, hm, as, mouthpieces, to, express, his, own, views, on, fascism, and, beauty, mishima, explained, that, after, writing, the, all, female, play, madame, de, sade, he, wanted, to, write, a, counterpart, play, with, an, all, male, cast, mishima, wrote, of, my, friend, hitler, you, may, read, this, tragedy, as, an, allegory, of, the, relationship, between, kubo, toshimichi, and, saig, takamori, two, heroes, of, japan, s, meiji, restoration, who, initially, worked, together, but, later, had, a, falling, out, that, same, year, he, wrote, life, for, sale, a, humorous, story, about, a, man, who, after, failing, to, commit, suicide, advertises, his, life, for, sale, in, a, review, of, the, english, translation, novelist, ian, thomson, called, it, a, pulp, noir, and, a, sexy, camp, delight, but, also, noted, that, beneath, the, hard, boiled, dialogue, and, the, gangster, high, jinks, is, a, familiar, indictment, of, consumerist, japan, and, a, romantic, yearning, for, the, past, mishima, was, hated, by, leftists, who, said, hirohito, should, have, abdicated, to, take, responsibility, for, the, loss, of, life, in, the, war, they, also, hated, him, for, his, outspoken, commitment, to, bushido, the, code, of, the, samurai, in, the, way, of, the, samurai, hagakure, ny, mon, his, support, for, the, abolition, of, article, 9, of, the, japanese, constitution, and, for, his, contention, in, his, critique, the, defense, of, culture, bunka, b, eiron, that, preached, the, importance, of, the, emperor, in, japanese, cultures, mishima, regarded, the, postwar, era, of, japan, where, no, poetic, culture, and, supreme, artist, was, born, as, an, era, of, fake, prosperity, and, stated, in, the, defense, of, culture, in, the, postwar, prosperity, called, sh, wa, genroku, where, there, are, no, chikamatsu, monzaemon, ihara, saikaku, matsuo, bash, only, infestation, of, flashy, manners, and, customs, in, there, passion, is, dried, up, strong, realism, dispels, the, ground, and, the, deepening, of, poetry, is, neglected, that, is, there, are, no, chikamatsu, saikaku, or, basho, now, in, other, critical, essays, mishima, argued, that, the, national, spirit, which, cultivated, in, japan, s, long, history, is, the, key, to, national, defense, and, he, had, apprehensions, about, the, insidious, indirect, aggression, of, the, chinese, communist, party, north, korea, and, the, soviet, union, in, critical, essays, in, 1969, mishima, explained, japan, s, difficult, and, delicate, position, and, peculiarities, between, china, the, soviet, union, and, the, united, states, to, put, it, simply, support, for, the, security, treaty, means, agreeing, with, the, united, states, and, to, oppose, it, means, agreeing, with, the, soviet, union, or, the, chinese, communist, party, so, after, all, it, s, only, just, a, matter, of, which, foreign, country, to, rely, on, and, therein, the, question, of, what, is, japan, is, completely, lacking, if, you, ask, the, japanese, hey, you, do, you, choose, america, soviet, union, or, chinese, communist, party, if, he, is, a, true, japanese, he, will, withhold, his, attitude, in, regards, to, those, who, strongly, opposed, the, us, military, base, in, okinawa, and, the, security, treaty, they, may, appear, to, be, nationalists, and, right, wingers, in, the, foreign, common, sense, but, in, japan, most, of, them, are, in, fact, left, wingers, and, communists, throughout, this, period, mishima, continued, to, work, on, his, magnum, opus, the, sea, of, fertility, tetralogy, of, novels, which, began, appearing, in, a, monthly, serialized, format, in, september, 1965, the, four, completed, novels, were, spring, snow, 1969, runaway, horses, 1969, the, temple, of, dawn, 1970, and, the, decay, of, the, angel, published, posthumously, in, 1971, mishima, aimed, for, a, very, long, novel, with, a, completely, different, raison, d, tre, from, western, chronicle, novels, of, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, rather, than, telling, the, story, of, a, single, individual, or, family, mishima, boldly, set, his, goal, as, interpreting, the, entire, human, world, in, the, decay, of, the, angel, four, stories, convey, the, transmigration, of, the, human, soul, as, the, main, character, goes, through, a, series, of, reincarnations, mishima, hoped, to, express, in, literary, terms, something, akin, to, pantheism, novelist, paul, theroux, blurbed, the, first, edition, of, the, english, translation, of, the, sea, of, fertility, as, the, most, complete, vision, we, have, of, japan, in, the, twentieth, century, and, critic, charles, solomon, wrote, in, 1990, that, the, four, novels, remain, one, of, the, outstanding, works, of, 20th, century, literature, and, a, summary, of, the, author, s, life, and, work, in, august, 1966, mishima, visited, miwa, shrine, in, nara, prefecture, thought, to, be, one, of, the, oldest, shint, shrines, in, japan, as, well, as, the, hometown, of, his, mentor, zenmei, hasuda, and, the, areas, associated, with, the, shinp, ren, rebellion, an, uprising, against, the, meiji, government, by, samurai, in, 1876, this, trip, would, become, the, inspiration, for, portions, of, runaway, horses, the, second, novel, in, the, sea, of, fertility, tetralogy, while, in, kumamoto, mishima, purchased, a, japanese, sword, for, 100, 000, yen, mishima, envisioned, the, reincarnation, of, kiyoaki, the, protagonist, of, the, first, novel, spring, snow, as, a, man, named, isao, who, put, his, life, on, the, line, to, bring, about, a, restoration, of, direct, rule, by, the, emperor, against, the, backdrop, of, the, league, of, blood, incident, in, 1932, from, 12, april, to, 27, may, 1967, mishima, underwent, basic, training, with, the, ground, self, defense, force, gsdf, mishima, had, originally, lobbied, to, train, with, the, gsdf, for, six, months, but, was, met, with, resistance, from, the, defense, agency, mishima, s, training, period, was, finalized, to, 46, days, which, required, using, some, of, his, connections, his, participation, in, gsdf, training, was, kept, secret, both, because, the, defense, agency, did, not, want, to, give, the, impression, that, anyone, was, receiving, special, treatment, and, because, mishima, wanted, to, experience, real, military, life, accordingly, mishima, trained, under, his, birth, name, kimitake, hiraoka, and, most, of, his, fellow, soldiers, did, not, recognize, him, from, june, 1967, mishima, became, a, leading, figure, in, a, plan, to, create, a, 10, 000, man, japan, national, guard, sokoku, b, eitai, as, a, civilian, complement, to, japan, s, self, defense, forces, he, began, leading, groups, of, right, wing, college, students, to, undergo, basic, training, with, the, gsdf, in, the, hope, of, training, 100, officers, to, lead, the, national, guard, like, many, other, right, wingers, mishima, was, especially, alarmed, by, the, riots, and, revolutionary, actions, undertaken, by, radical, new, left, university, students, who, took, over, dozens, of, college, campuses, in, japan, in, 1968, and, 1969, on, 26, february, 1968, the, 32nd, anniversary, of, the, february, 26, incident, he, and, several, other, right, wingers, met, at, the, editorial, offices, of, the, recently, founded, right, wing, magazine, controversy, journal, rons, jaanaru, where,

succeeded, only, in, irritating, the, soldiers, and, was, heckled, with, jeers, and, the, noise, of, helicopters, drowning, out, some, parts, of, his, speech, in, his, speech, mishima, rebuked, the, jsdf, for, their, passive, acceptance, of, a, constitution, that, denies, their, own, existence, and, shouted, to, rouse, them, where, has, the, spirit, of, the, samurai, gone, in, his, final, written, appeal, geki, that, morita, and, ogawa, scattered, copies, of, from, the, balcony, mishima, expressed, his, dissatisfaction, with, the, half, baked, nature, of, the, jsdf, it, is, self, evident, that, the, united, states, would, not, be, pleased, with, a, true, japanese, volunteer, army, protecting, the, land, of, japan, after, he, finished, reading, his, prepared, speech, in, a, few, minutes, time, mishima, cried, out, long, live, the, emperor, tenno, heika, banzai, three, times, he, then, retreated, into, the, commandant, s, office, and, apologized, to, the, commandant, saying, we, did, it, to, return, the, jsdf, to, the, emperor, i, had, no, choice, but, to, do, this, mishima, then, committed, seppuku, a, form, of, ritual, suicide, by, disembowelment, associated, with, the, samurai, morita, had, been, assigned, to, serve, as, mishima, s, second, kaishakunin, cutting, off, his, head, with, a, sword, at, the, end, of, the, rite, to, spare, him, unnecessary, pain, however, morita, proved, unable, to, complete, his, task, and, after, three, failed, attempts, to, sever, mishima, s, head, koga, had, to, step, in, and, complete, the, task, according, to, the, testimony, of, the, surviving, coup, members, originally, all, four, tatenokai, members, had, planned, to, commit, seppuku, along, with, mishima, however, mishima, attempted, to, dissuade, them, and, three, of, the, members, acquiesced, to, his, wishes, only, morita, persisted, saying, i, can, t, let, mr, mishima, die, alone, but, mishima, knew, that, morita, had, a, girlfriend, and, still, hoped, he, might, live, just, before, his, seppuku, mishima, tried, one, more, time, to, dissuade, him, saying, morita, you, must, live, not, die, nevertheless, after, mishima, s, seppuku, morita, knelt, and, stabbed, himself, in, the, abdomen, and, koga, acted, as, kaishakunin, again, this, coup, attempt, is, called, the, mishima, incident, mishima, jiken, in, japan, another, traditional, element, of, the, suicide, ritual, was, the, composition, of, so, called, death, poems, by, the, tatenokai, members, before, their, entry, into, the, headquarters, having, been, enlisted, in, the, ground, self, defense, force, for, about, four, years, mishima, and, other, tatenokai, members, alongside, several, officials, were, secretly, researching, coup, plans, for, a, constitutional, amendment, they, thought, there, was, a, chance, when, security, dispatch, chian, shutsudo, was, dispatched, to, subjugate, the, zenkyoto, revolt, however, zenkyoto, was, suppressed, easily, by, the, riot, police, unit, in, october, 1969, these, officials, gave, up, the, coup, of, constitutional, amendment, and, mishima, was, disappointed, in, them, and, the, actual, circumstances, in, japan, after,

approval, of, the, u, s, army, side, they, were, supposed, to, carry, out, a, security, dispatch, toward, the, armed, forces, of, the, japan, self, defense, forces, however, due, to, the, policy, change, reversal, of, u, s, by, henry, kissinger, who, prepared, for, visiting, china, in, secret, changing, relations, between, u, s, and, china, it, became, a, situation, where, the, japanese,
