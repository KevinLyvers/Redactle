that, included, his, symphonic, poem, aino, a, patriotic, piece, that, may, have, inspired, sibelius, s, later, interest, in, using, the, epic, poem, kalevala, as, a, basis, for, his, own, compositions, while, in, vienna, he, became, particularly, interested, in, the, music, of, anton, bruckner, whom, he, regarded, as, the, greatest, living, composer, for, a, time, although, also,

unfortunately, i, preferred, an, elegant, violin, bow, my, love, for, the, violin, lasted, quite, long, and, it, was, a, very, painful, awakening, when, i, had, to, admit, that, i, had, begun, my, training, for, the, exacting, career, of, a, virtuoso, too, late, in, addition, to, the, long, periods, he, spent, studying, in, vienna, and, berlin, in, 1900, he, travelled, to, italy, where, he,

although, it, was, not, too, well, received, the, critics, suggesting, that, superfluous, sections, should, be, eliminated, as, they, were, in, sibelius, s, 1902, version, even, less, successful, were, three, more, performances, of, kullervo, in, march, which, one, critic, found, incomprehensible, and, lacking, in, vitality, following, the, birth, of, sibelius, s, first, child, eva, in, april,

boat, again, based, on, the, kalevala, to, some, extent, he, had, come, under, the, influence, of, wagner, but, subsequently, turned, to, liszt, s, tone, poems, as, a, source, of, compositional, inspiration, adapted, from, material, for, the, opera, which, he, never, completed, his, lemmink, inen, suite, consisted, of, four, legends, in, the, form, of, tone, poems, they, were, premiered, in, helsinki, on, 13, april, 1896, to, a, full, house, in, contrast, to, merikanto, s, enthusiasm, for, the, finnish, quality, of, the, work, the, critic, karl, flodin, found, the, cor, anglais, solo, in, the, swan, of, tuonela, stupendously, long, and, boring, although, he, considered, the, first, legend, lemmink, inen, and, the, maidens, of, the, island, as, representing, the, peak, of, sibelius, s, achievement, to, date, to, pay, his, way, from, 1892, sibelius, had, taken, on, teaching, assignments, at, the, music, institute, and, at, kajanus, s, conducting, school, but, this, left, him, insufficient, time, for, composing, the, situation, improved, considerably, when, in, 1898, he, was, awarded, a, substantial, annual, grant, initially, for, ten, years, and, later, extended, for, life, he, was, able, to, complete, the, music, for, adolf, paul, s, play, king, christian, ii, performed, on, 24, february, 1898, its, catchy, tunes, appealed, to, the, public, the, scores, of, four,

commented, the, music, sounded, excellent, and, the, tempi, seem, to, be, right, i, think, this, is, the, first, time, that, i, have, managed, to, make, something, complete, the, work, was, also, performed, in, stockholm, and, leipzig, in, january, 1899, sibelius, embarked, on, his, first, symphony, at, a, time, when, his, patriotic, feelings, were, being, enhanced, by, the, russian, emperor, nicholas, ii, s, attempt, to, restrict, the, powers, of, the, grand, duchy, of, finland, the, symphony, was, well, received, when, it, was, premiered, in, helsinki, on, 26, april, 1899, but, the, program, also, premiered, the, even, more, compelling, blatantly, patriotic, song, of, the, athenians, for, boys, and, men, s, choirs, the, song, immediately, brought, sibelius, the, status, of, a, national, hero, another, patriotic, work, followed, on, 4, november, in, the, form, of, eight, tableaux, depicting, episodes, from, finnish, history, known, as, the, press, celebration, music, it,

was, received, with, tremendous, enthusiasm, by, the, finns, merikanto, felt, it, exceeded, even, the, boldest, expectations, while, evert, katila, qualified, it, as, an, absolute, masterpiece, flodin, too, wrote, of, a, symphonic, composition, the, likes, of, which, we, have, never, had, occasion, to, listen, to, before, sibelius, spent, the, summer, in, tv, rminne, near, hanko, where, he,

his, time, in, helsinki, where, he, indulged, excessively, in, wining, and, dining, running, up, considerable, bills, in, the, restaurants, but, he, continued, to, compose, one, of, his, major,

wrote, to, him, imploring, him, to, return, home, but, to, no, avail, even, after, their, fourth, daughter, katarina, was, born, he, continued, to, work, away, from, home, early, in, 1904, he, finished, his, violin, concerto, but, its, first, public, performance, on, 8, february, was, not, a, success, it, led, to, a, revised, condensed, version, that, was, performed, in, berlin, the, following, year, in, november, 1903, sibelius, began, to, build, his, new, home, ainola, aino, s, place, near, lake, tuusula, some, 45, km, 30, miles, north, of, helsinki, to, cover, the,

very, positive, while, those, in, the, allgemeine, zeitung, and, the, berliner, tageblatt, were, less, enthusiastic, back, in, finland, he, rewrote, the, increasingly, popular, pell, as, and, m, lisande, as, an, orchestral, suite, in, november, visiting, britain, for, the, first, time, he, went, to, liverpool, where, he, met, henry, wood, on, 2, december, he, conducted, the, first, symphony,

the, year, sibelius, spent, several, months, composing, in, ainola, his, major, work, of, the, period, being, pohjola, s, daughter, yet, another, piece, based, on, the, kalevala, later, in, the, year, he, composed, incidental, music, for, belshazzar, s, feast, also, adapting, it, as, an, orchestral, suite, he, ended, the, year, conducting, a, series, of, concerts, the, most, successful, being, the, first, public, performance, of, pohjola, s, daughter, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, st, petersburg, from, the, beginning, of, 1907, sibelius, again, indulged, in, excessive, wining, and, dining, in, helsinki, spending, exorbitant, amounts, on, champagne, and, lobster, his, lifestyle, had, a, disastrous, effect, on, the, health, of, aino, who, was, driven, to, retire, to, a, sanatorium,

performance, in, helsinki, on, 25, september, although, its, more, classical, approach, surprised, the, audience, flodin, commented, that, it, was, internally, new, and, revolutionary, shortly, afterwards, sibelius, met, gustav, mahler, who, was, in, helsinki, the, two, agreed, that, with, each, new, symphony, they, lost, those, who, had, been, attracted, to, their, earlier, works, this, was, demonstrated, above, all, in, st, petersburg, where, the, third, symphony, was, performed, in, november, 1907, to, dismissive, reviews, its, reception, in, moscow, was, rather, more, positive, in, 1907, sibelius, underwent, a, serious, operation, for, suspected, throat, cancer, early, in, 1908, he, had, to, spend, a, spell, in, hospital, his, smoking, and, drinking, had, now, become, life, threatening, although, he, cancelled, concerts, in, rome, warsaw, and, berlin, he, maintained, an, engagement, in, london, but, there, too, his, third, symphony, failed, to, attract, the, critics, in, may, 1908, sibelius, s, health, deteriorated, further, he, travelled, with, his, wife, to, berlin, to, have, a, tumour, removed, from, his, throat, after, the, operation, he, vowed, to, give, up, smoking, and, drinking, once, and, for, all, the, impact, of, this, brush, with, death, has, been, said, to, have, inspired, works, that, he, composed, in, the, following, years, including, luonnotar, and, the, fourth, symphony, in, 1909, the, successful, throat, operation, resulted, in, renewed, happiness, between, sibelius, and, aino, in, the, family, home, in, britain, too, his, condition, was, well, received, as, he, conducted, en, saga, finlandia, valse, triste, and, spring, song, to, enthusiastic, audiences, a, meeting, with, claude, debussy, produced, further, support, after, another, uneventful, trip, to, paris, he, went, to, berlin, where, he, was, relieved, to, learn, that, his, throat, operation, had, been, entirely, successful, sibelius, started, work, on, his, fourth, symphony, in, early, 1910, but, his, dwindling, funds, also, required, him, to, write, a, number, of, smaller, pieces, and, songs, in, october, he, conducted, concerts, in, kristiania, now, oslo, where, the, dryad, and, in, memoriam, were, first, performed, his, valse, triste, and, second, symphony, were, particularly, well, received, he, then, travelled, to, berlin, to, continue, work, on, his, fourth, symphony, writing, the, finale, after, returning, to, j, rvenp, sibelius, conducted, his, first, concerts, in, sweden, in, early, 1911, when, even, his, third, symphony, was, welcomed, by, the, critics, he, completed, the, fourth, symphony, in, april, but, as, he, expected, with, its, introspective, style, it, was, not, very, warmly, received, when, first, performed, in, helsinki, with, mixed, reviews, apart, from, a, trip, to, paris, where, he, enjoyed, a, performance, of, richard, strauss, s, salome, the, rest, of, the, year, was, fairly, uneventful, in, 1912, he, completed, his, short, orchestral, work, sc, nes, historiques, ii, it, was, first, performed, in, march, together, with, the, fourth, symphony, the, concert, was, repeated, twice, to, enthusiastic, audiences, and, critics, including, robert, kajanus, the, fourth, symphony, was, also, well, received, in, birmingham, in, september, in, march, 1913, it, was, performed, in, new, york, but, a, large, section, of, the, audience, left, the, hall, between, the, movements, while, in, october, after, a, concert, conducted, by, carl, muck, the, boston, american, labelled, it, a, sad, failure, sibelius, s, first, significant, composition, of, 1913, was, the, tone, poem, the, bard, which, he, conducted, in, march, to, a, respectful, audience, in, helsinki, he, went, on, to, compose, luonnotar, daughter, of, nature, for, soprano, and, orchestra, with, a, text, from, the, kalevala, it, was, first, performed, in, finnish, in, september, 1913, by, aino, ackt, to, whom, it, had, been, dedicated, at, the, music, festival, in, gloucester, england, in, early, 1914, sibelius, spent, a, month, in, berlin, where, he, was, particularly, drawn, to, arnold, schoenberg, back, in, finland, he, began, work, on, the, oceanides, which, the, american, millionaire, carl, stoeckel, had, commissioned, for, the, norfolk, music, festival, after, first, composing, the, work, in, d, flat, major, sibelius, undertook, substantive, revisions, presenting, a, d, major, version, in, norfolk, which, was, well, received, as, were, finlandia, and, the, valse, triste, henry, krehbiel, considered, the, oceanides, one, of, the, most, beautiful, pieces, of, sea, music, ever, composed, while, the, new, york, times, commented, that, sibelius, s, music, was, the, most, notable, contribution, to, the, music, festival, while, in, america, sibelius, received, an, honorary, doctorate, from, yale, university, and, almost, simultaneously, one, from, the, university, of, helsinki, where, he, was, represented, by, aino, while, travelling, back, from, the, united, states, sibelius, heard, about, the, events, in, sarajevo, that, led, to, the, beginning, of, the, first, world, war, although, he, was, far, away, from, the, fighting, his, royalties, from, abroad, were, interrupted, to, make, ends, meet, he, composed, smaller, works, for, publication, in, finland, in, march, 1915, he, was, able, to, travel, to, gothenburg, in, sweden, where, his, work, the, oceanides, was, widely, appreciated, while, working, on, his, fifth, symphony, in, april, he, saw, 16, swans, flying, by, inspiring, him, to, write, the, finale, one, of, the, great, experiences, of, my, life, he, commented, although, there, was, little, progress, on, the, symphony, during, the, summer, he, was, able, to, complete, it, by, his, 50th, birthday, on, 8, december, on, the, evening, of, his, birthday, sibelius, conducted, the, premiere, of, the, fifth, symphony, in, the, hall, of, the, helsinki, stock, exchange, despite, high, praise, from, kajanus, the, composer, was, not, satisfied, with, his, work, and, soon, began, to, revise, it, around, this, time, sibelius, was, running, ever, deeper, into, debt, the, grand, piano, he, had, received, as, a, present, was, about, to, be, confiscated, by, the, bailiffs, when, the, singer, ida, ekman, paid, off, a, large, proportion, of, his, debt, after, a, successful, fund, raising, campaign, a, year, later, on, 8, december, 1916, sibelius, presented, the, revised, version, of, his, fifth, symphony, in, turku, combining, the, first, two, movements, and, simplifying, the, finale, when, it, was, performed, a, week, later, in, helsinki, katila, was, very, favourable, but, wasenius, frowned, on, the, changes, leading, the, composer, to, rewrite, it, once, again, from, the, beginning, of, 1917, sibelius, started, drinking, again, triggering, arguments, with, aino, their, relationship, improved, with, the, excitement, resulting, from, the, start, of, the, russian, revolution, by, the, end, of, the, year, sibelius, had, composed, his, j, ger, march, the, piece, proved, particularly, popular, after, the, finnish, parliament, accepted, the, senate, s, declaration, of, independence, from, russia, in, december, 1917, the, j, ger, march, first, played, on, 19, january, 1918, delighted, the, helsinki, elite, for, a, short, time, until, the, start, of, the, finnish, civil, war, on, 27, january, sibelius, naturally, supported, the, whites, but, as, a, tolstoyan, aino, sibelius, had, some, sympathies, for, the, reds, too, in, february, his, house, ainola, was, searched, twice, by, the, local, red, guard, looking, for, weapons, during, the, first, weeks, of, the, war, some, of, his, acquaintances, were, killed, in, the, violence, and, his, brother, the, psychiatrist, christian, sibelius, was, arrested, because, he, refused, to, reserve, beds, for, the, red, soldiers, who, had, suffered, shell, shock, at, the, front, sibelius, s, friends, in, helsinki, were, now, worried, about, his, safety, the, composer, robert, kajanus, negotiated, with, the, red, guard, commander, in, chief, eero, haapalainen, who, guaranteed, sibelius, a, safe, journey, from, ainola, to, the, capital, on, 20, february, a, group, of, red, guard, fighters, escorted, the, family, to, helsinki, finally, from, 12, to, 13, april, the, german, troops, occupied, the, city, and, the, red, period, was, over, a, week, later, the, helsinki, philharmonic, orchestra, gave, a, concert, in, homage, to, the, german, commander, r, diger, von, der, goltz, sibelius, finished, off, the, event, by, conducting, the, j, ger, march, in, early, 1919, sibelius, enthusiastically, decided, to, change, his, image, shaving, off, what, remained, of, his, thinning, hair, in, june, together, with, aino, he, visited, copenhagen, on, his, first, trip, outside, finland, since, 1915, successfully, presenting, his, second, symphony, in, november, he, conducted, the, final, version, of, his, fifth, symphony, receiving, repeated, ovations, from, the, audience, by, the, end, of, the, year, he, was, already, working, on, the, sixth, in, 1920, despite, a, growing, tremor, in, his, hands, sibelius, composed, the, hymn, of, the, earth, to, a, text, by, the, poet, eino, leino, for, the, suomen, laulu, choir, and, orchestrated, his, valse, lyrique, helped, along, by, drinking, wine, on, his, birthday, in, december, 1920, sibelius, received, a, donation, of, 63, 000, marks, a, substantial, sum, the, tenor, w, in, sola, had, raised, from, finnish, businesses, although, he, used, some, of, the, money, to, reduce, his, debts, he, also, spent, a, week, celebrating, to, excess, in, helsinki, at, this, time, sibelius, held, detailed, negotiations, with, george, eastman, inventor, of, the, kodak, camera, and, founder, of, the, eastman, school, of, music, in, rochester, new, york, eastman, offered, 20, 000, salary, to, teach, for, a, single, year, and, before, sibelius, declined, negotiations, were, so, firm, that, the, new, york, times, published, sibelius, s, arrival, as, fact, sibelius, enjoyed, a, highly, successful, trip, to, england, in, early, 1921, conducting, several, concerts, around, the, country, including, the, fourth, and, fifth, symphonies, the, oceanides, the, ever, popular, finlandia, and, valse, triste, immediately, afterwards, he, conducted, the, second, symphony, and, valse, triste, in, norway, he, was, beginning, to, suffer, from, exhaustion, but, the, critics, remained, positive, on, his, return, to, finland, in, april, he, presented, lemmink, inen, s, return, and, the, fifth, symphony, at, the, nordic, music, days, early, in, 1922, after, suffering, from, headaches, sibelius, decided, to, acquire, spectacles, although, he, never, wore, them, for, photographs, in, july, he, was, saddened, by, the, death, of, his, brother, christian, in, august, he, joined, the, finnish, freemasons, and, composed, ritual, music, for, them, in, february, 1923, he, premiered, his, sixth, symphony, evert, katila, highly, praised, it, as, pure, idyll, before, the, year, ended, he, had, also, conducted, concerts, in, stockholm, and, rome, the, first, to, considerable, acclaim, the, second, to, mixed, reviews, he, then, proceeded, to, gothenburg, where, he, enjoyed, an, ecstatic, reception, despite, arriving, at, the, concert, hall, suffering, from, over, indulgence, in, food, and, drink, despite, continuing, to, drink, to, aino, s, dismay, sibelius, managed, to, complete, his, seventh, symphony, in, march, 1924, under, the, title, of, fantasia, sinfonica, it, received, its, first, public, performance, in, stockholm, where, it, was, a, success, it, was, even, more, highly, appreciated, at, a, series, of, concerts, in, copenhagen, in, late, september, sibelius, was, honoured, with, the, knight, commander, s, cross, of, the, order, of, the, dannebrog, he, spent, most, of, the, rest, of, the, year, resting, as, his, recent, spate, of, activity, was, straining, his, heart, and, nerves, composing, a, few, small, pieces, he, relied, increasingly, on, alcohol, in, may, 1925, his, danish, publisher, wilhelm, hansen, and, the, royal, danish, theatre, invited, him, to, compose, incidental, music, for, a, production, of, shakespeare, s, the, tempest, he, completed, the, work, well, in, advance, of, its, premiere, in, march, 1926, it, was, well, received, in, copenhagen, although, sibelius, was, not, there, himself, the, music, journalist, vesa, sir, n, has, found, evidence, that, sibelius, perhaps, suffered, from, essential, tremor, since, a, young, age, and, that, he, reduced, the, symptoms, by, drinking, alcohol, this, self, medication, is, common, and, effective, but, discouraged, by, doctors, due, to, the, risks, outweighing, the, benefits, sir, n, s, research, is, supported, by, several, medical, experts, the, tremor, presumably, prevented, writing, and, impaired, his, social, life, the, year, 1926, saw, a, sharp, and, lasting, decline, in, sibelius, s, output, after, his, seventh, symphony, he, produced, only, a, few, major, works, during, the, rest, of, his, life, arguably, the, two, most, significant, of, these, were, the, incidental, music, for, the, tempest, and, the, tone, poem, tapiola, for, most, of, the, last, thirty, years, of, his, life, sibelius, even, avoided, talking, publicly, about, his, music, there, is, substantial, evidence, that, sibelius, worked, on, an, eighth, symphony, he, promised, the, premiere, of, this, symphony, to, serge, koussevitzky, in, 1931, and, 1932, and, a, london, performance, in, 1933, under, basil, cameron, was, even, advertised, to, the, public, the, only, concrete, evidence, of, the, symphony, s, existence, on, paper, is, a, 1933, bill, for, a, fair, copy, of, the, first, movement, and, short, draft, fragments, first, published, and, played, in, 2011, sibelius, had, always, been, quite, self, critical, he, remarked, to, his, close, friends, if, i, cannot, write, a, better, symphony, than, my, seventh, then, it, shall, be, my, last, since, no, manuscript, survives, sources, consider, it, likely, that, sibelius, destroyed, most, traces, of, the, score, probably, in, 1945, during, which, year, he, certainly, consigned, a, great, many, papers, to, the, flames, his, wife, aino, recalled, in, the, 1940s, there, was, a, great, auto, da, f, at, ainola, my, husband, collected, a, number, of, the, manuscripts, in, a, laundry, basket, and, burned, them, on, the, open, fire, in, the, dining, room, parts, of, the, karelia, suite, were, destroyed, i, later, saw, remains, of, the, pages, which, had, been, torn, out, and, many, other, things, i, did, not, have, the, strength, to, be, present, and, left, the, room, i, therefore, do, not, know, what, he, threw, on, to, the, fire, but, after, this, my, husband, became, calmer, and, gradually, lighter, in, mood, despite, his, withdrawing, from, the, public, eye, sibelius, s, work, gained, substantial, attention, in, the, late, 1920s, and, throughout, the, 1930s, thanks, to, the, newly, established, finnish, broadcaster, yle, broadcasting, on, am, wavebands, yle, s, signals, brought, sibelius, s, music, to, listeners, beyond, finland, s, borders, too, in, 1933, yle, and, the, helsinki, city, orchestra, with, soloist, anja, ignatius, originated, a, broadcast, of, sibelius, compositions, to, 14, countries, in, coordination, with, the, international, broadcasting, union, the, program, included, the, tone, poem, the, oceanides, followed, by, his, fifth, symphony, and, the, violin, concerto, in, 1935, the, new, york, philharmonic, surveyed, the, preferences, of, music, listeners, around, the, united, states, when, asked, who, their, favourite, composer, was, sibelius, came, first, among, all, of, them, living, or, dead, this, degree, of, recognition, during, his, own, lifetime, was, unequalled, in, western, music, on, sibelius, s, 70th, birthday, 8, december, 1935, the, german, nazi, regime, awarded, him, the, goethe, medal, with, a, certificate, signed, by, adolf, hitler, after, the, attempted, soviet, invasion, of, finland, in, late, 1939, to, 1940, the, winter, war, which, though, initially, repelled, forced, finland, to, cede, territory, to, the, soviet, union, after, the, later, defeat, of, the, finnish, military, the, sibelius, family, returned, for, good, to, ainola, in, the, summer, of, 1941, after, a, long, absence, anxious, about, bolshevism, sibelius, advocated, that, finnish, soldiers, march, alongside, german, forces, after, germany, s, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, on, 22, june, 1941, sibelius, did, not, make, any, utterances, about, the, genocide, of, the, jews, although, in, a, diary, entry, in, 1943, he, wondered, why, he, had, signed, the, aryan, certificate, on, 1, january, 1939, sibelius, had, participated, in, an, international, radio, broadcast, during, which, he, conducted, his, andante, festivo, the, performance, was, preserved, on, transcription, discs, and, later, issued, on, cd, this, is, probably, the, only, surviving, example, of, sibelius, interpreting, his, own, music, from, 1903, and, for, many, years, thereafter, sibelius, lived, in, the, countryside, from, 1939, he, and, aino, again, had, a, home, in, helsinki, but, they, moved, back, to, ainola, in, 1941, only, occasionally, visiting, the, city, after, the, war, he, returned, to, helsinki, only, a, couple, of, times, the, so, called, silence, of, j, rvenp, became, something, of, a, myth, as, in, addition, to, countless, official, visitors, and, colleagues, his, grandchildren, and, great, grandchildren, also, spent, their, holidays, there, sibelius, avoided, public, statements, about, other, composers, but, erik, w, tawaststjerna, and, sibelius, s, secretary, santeri, levas, have, documented, private, conversations, in, which, he, admired, richard, strauss, and, considered, b, la, bart, k, and, dmitri, shostakovich, the, most, talented, composers, of, the, younger, generation, in, the, 1950s, he, promoted, the, young, finnish, composer, einojuhani, rautavaara, his, 90th, birthday, in, 1955, was, widely, celebrated, and, both, the, philadelphia, orchestra, under, eugene, ormandy, and, the, royal, philharmonic, orchestra, under, sir, thomas, beecham, gave, special, performances, of, his, music, tawaststjerna, also, relates, an, anecdote, in, connection, with, sibelius, s, death, was, returning, from, his, customary, morning, walk, exhilarated, he, told, his, wife, aino, that, he, had, seen, a, flock, of, cranes, approaching, there, they, come, the, birds, of, my, youth, he, exclaimed, suddenly, one, of, the, birds, broke, away, from, the, formation, and, circled, once, above, ainola, it, then, rejoined, the, flock, to, continue, its, journey, two, years, later, in, ainola, on, the, evening, of, 20, september, 1957, sibelius, died, of, a, brain, hemorrhage, at, the, age, of, 91, at, the, time, of, his, death, his, fifth, symphony, conducted, by, sir, malcolm, sargent, was, being, broadcast, by, radio, from, helsinki, at, the, same, time, the, united, nations, general, assembly, was, in, session, and, the, then, president, of, the, assembly, sir, leslie, munro, of, new, zealand, called, for, a, moment, of, silence, and, delivered, a, eulogy, sibelius, belonged, to, the, whole, world, he, enriched, the, life, of, the, entire, human, race, with, his, music, another, well, known, finnish, composer, heino, kaski, died, on, the, same, day, but, his, death, was, overshadowed, by, that, of, sibelius, sibelius, was, honoured, with, a, state, funeral, and, is, buried, in, the, garden, at, ainola, aino, sibelius, continued, to, live, in, ainola, for, the, next, 12, years, until, her, death, on, 8, june, 1969, at, the, age, of, 97, she, is, buried, next, to, her, husband, sibelius, is, widely, known, for, his, symphonies, and, his, tone, poems, especially, finlandia, and, the, karelia, suite, his, reputation, in, finland, grew, in, the, 1890s, with, the, choral, symphony, kullervo, which, like, many, subsequent, pieces, drew, on, the, epic, poem, kalevala, his, first, symphony, was, first, performed, to, an, enthusiastic, audience, in, 1899, at, a, time, when, finnish, nationalism, was, evolving, in, addition, to, six, more, symphonies, he, gained, popularity, at, home, and, abroad, with, incidental, music, and, more, tone, poems, especially, en, saga, the, swan, of, tuonela, and, valse, triste, sibelius, also, composed, a, series, of, works, for, violin, and, orchestra, including, a, violin, concerto, the, opera, jungfrun, i, tornet, many, shorter, orchestral, pieces, chamber, music, works, for, piano, and, violin, choral, works, and, numerous, songs, in, the, mid, 1920s, after, his, sixth, and, seventh, symphonies, he, composed, the, symphonic, poem, tapiola, and, incidental, music, for, the, tempest, thereafter, although, he, lived, until, 1957, he, did, not, publish, any, further, works, of, note, for, several, years, he, worked, on, an, eighth, symphony, which, he, later, burned, as, for, his, musical, style, hints, of, tchaikovsky, s, music, are, particularly, evident, in, early, works, such, as, his, first, symphony, and, his, violin, concerto, for, a, period, he, was, nevertheless, overwhelmed, by, wagner, particularly, while, composing, his, opera, more, lasting, influences, included, ferruccio, busoni, and, anton, bruckner, but, for, his, tone, poems, he, was, above, all, inspired, by, liszt, the, similarities, to, bruckner, can, be, seen, in, the, brass, contributions, to, his, orchestral, works, and, the, generally, slow, tempo, of, his, music, sibelius, progressively, stripped, away, formal, markers, of, sonata, form, in, his, work, and, instead, of, contrasting, multiple, themes, focused, on, the, idea, of, continuously, evolving, cells, and, fragments, culminating, in, a, grand, statement, his, later, works, are, remarkable, for, their, sense, of, unbroken, development, progressing, by, means, of, thematic, permutations, and, derivations, the, completeness, and, organic, feel, of, this, synthesis, has, prompted, some, to, suggest, that, sibelius, began, his, works, with, a, finished, statement, and, worked, backwards, although, analyses, showing, these, predominantly, three, and, four, note, cells, and, melodic, fragments, as, they, are, developed, and, expanded, into, the, larger, themes, effectively, prove, the, opposite, this, self, contained, structure, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, symphonic, style, of, gustav, mahler, sibelius, s, primary, rival, in, symphonic, composition, while, thematic, variation, played, a, major, role, in, the, works, of, both, composers, mahler, s, style, made, use, of, disjunct, abruptly, changing, and, contrasting, themes, while, sibelius, sought, to, slowly, transform, thematic, elements, in, november, 1907, mahler, undertook, a, conducting, tour, of, finland, and, the, two, composers, were, able, to, take, a, lengthy, walk, together, leading, sibelius, to, comment, i, said, that, i, admired, severity, of, style, and, the, profound, logic, that, created, an, inner, connection, between, all, the, motifs, mahler, s, opinion, was, just, the, reverse, no, a, symphony, must, be, like, the, world, it, must, embrace, everything, sibelius, started, work, on, his, symphony, no, 1, in, e, minor, op, 39, in, 1898, and, completed, it, in, early, 1899, when, he, was, 33, the, work, was, first, performed, on, 26, april, 1899, by, the, helsinki, philharmonic, orchestra, conducted, by, the, composer, in, an, original, well, received, version, that, has, not, survived, after, the, premiere, sibelius, made, some, revisions, resulting, in, the, version, performed, today, the, revision, was, completed, in, the, spring, and, summer, of, 1900, and, was, first, performed, in, berlin, by, the, helsinki, philharmonic, conducted, by, robert, kajanus, on, 18, july, 1900, the, symphony, begins, with, a, highly, original, rather, forlorn, clarinet, solo, backed, by, subdued, timpani, his, second, symphony, the, most, popular, and, most, frequently, recorded, of, his, symphonies, was, first, performed, by, the, helsinki, philharmonic, society, on, 8, march, 1902, with, the, composer, conducting, the, opening, chords, with, their, rising, progression, provide, a, motif, for, the, whole, work, the, heroic, theme, of, the, finale, with, the, three, tone, motif, is, interpreted, by, the, trumpets, rather, than, the, original, woodwinds, during, a, period, of, russian, oppression, it, consolidated, sibelius, s, reputation, as, a, national, hero, after, the, first, performance, sibelius, made, some, changes, leading, to, a, revised, version, first, performed, by, armas, j, rnefelt, on, 10, november, 1903, in, stockholm, the, third, symphony, is, a, good, natured, triumphal, and, deceptively, simple, sounding, piece, the, symphony, s, first, performance, was, given, by, the, helsinki, philharmonic, society, conducted, by, the, composer, on, 25, september, 1907, there, are, themes, from, finnish, folk, music, in, the, work, s, early, chords, composed, just, after, his, move, to, ainola, it, contrasts, sharply, with, the, first, two, symphonies, with, its, clear, mode, of, expression, developing, into, the, marching, tones, of, the, finale, his, fourth, symphony, was, premiered, in, helsinki, on, 3, april, 1911, by, the, philharmonia, society, with, sibelius, conducting, it, was, written, while, sibelius, was, undergoing, a, series, of, operations, to, remove, a, tumour, from, his, throat, its, grimness, can, perhaps, be, explained, as, a, reaction, from, his, temporary, decision, to, give, up, drinking, the, opening, bars, with, cellos, basses, and, bassoons, convey, a, new, approach, to, timing, it, then, develops, into, melancholic, sketches, based, on, the, composer, s, setting, of, poe, s, the, raven, the, waning, finale, is, perhaps, a, premonition, of, the, silence, sibelius, would, experience, twenty, years, later, in, contrast, to, the, usual, assertive, finales, of, the, times, the, work, ends, simply, with, a, leaden, thud, symphony, no, 5, was, premiered, in, helsinki, to, great, acclaim, by, sibelius, himself, on, 8, december, 1915, his, 50th, birthday, the, version, most, commonly, performed, today, is, the, final, revision, consisting, of, three, movements, presented, in, 1919, the, fifth, is, sibelius, s, only, symphony, in, a, major, key, throughout, from, its, soft, opening, played, by, the, horns, the, work, develops, into, rotational, repetitions, of, its, various, themes, with, considerable, transformations, building, up, to, the, trumpeted, swan, hymn, in, the, final, movement, while, the, fifth, had, already, started, to, veer, away, from, the, sonata, form, the, sixth, conducted, by, the, composer, at, its, premiere, in, february, 1923, is, even, further, removed, from, the, traditional, norms, tawaststjerna, comments, that, the, structure, follows, no, familiar, pattern, composed, in, the, dorian, mode, it, draws, on, some, of, the, themes, developed, while, sibelius, was, working, on, the, fifth, as, well, as, from, material, intended, for, a, lyrical, violin, concerto, now, taking, a, purified, approach, sibelius, sought, to, offer, spring, water, rather, than, cocktails, making, use, of, lighter, flutes, and, strings, rather, than, the, heavy, brass, of, the, fifth, symphony, no, 7, in, c, major, was, his, last, published, symphony, completed, in, 1924, it, is, notable, for, having, only, one, movement, it, has, been, described, as, completely, original, in, form, subtle, in, its, handling, of, tempi, individual, in, its, treatment, of, key, and, wholly, organic, in, growth, it, has, also, been, called, sibelius, s, most, remarkable, compositional, achievement, initially, titled, fantasia, sinfonica, it, was, first, performed, in, stockholm, in, march, 1924, conducted, by, sibelius, it, was, based, on, an, adagio, movement, he, had, sketched, almost, ten, years, earlier, while, the, strings, dominate, there, is, also, a, distinctive, trombone, theme, after, the, seven, symphonies, and, the, violin, concerto, sibelius, s, thirteen, symphonic, poems, are, his, most, important, works, for, orchestra, and, along, with, the, tone, poems, of, richard, strauss, represent, some, of, the, most, important, contributions, to, the, genre, since, franz, liszt, as, a, group, the, symphonic, poems, span, the, entirety, of, sibelius, s, artistic, career, the, first, was, composed, in, 1892, while, the, last, appeared, in, 1925, display, the, composer, s, fascination, with, nature, and, finnish, mythology, particularly, the, kalevala, and, provide, a, comprehensive, portrait, of, his, stylistic, maturation, over, time, en, saga, meaning, a, fairy, tale, in, swedish, was, first, presented, in, february, 1893, with, sibelius, conducting, the, single, movement, tone, poem, was, possibly, inspired, by, the, icelandic, mythological, work, edda, although, sibelius, simply, described, it, as, an, expression, of, state, of, mind, beginning, with, a, dreamy, theme, from, the, strings, it, evolves, into, the, tones, of, the, woodwinds, then, the, horns, and, the, violas, demonstrating, sibelius, s, ability, to, handle, an, orchestra, the, composer, s, first, significant, orchestral, piece, it, was, revised, in, 1902, when, ferruccio, busoni, invited, sibelius, to, conduct, his, work, in, berlin, its, successful, reception, encouraged, him, to, write, to, aino, i, have, been,

the, poem, s, four, stanzas, and, evoking, the, mood, of, a, particular, episode, first, heroic, vigour, second, frenetic, activity, third, sensual, love, and, fourth, inconsolable, grief, despite, the, music, s, beauty, many, critics, have, faulted, sibelius, for, his, over, reliance, on, the, source, material, s, narrative, structure, the, lemmink, inen, suite, was, composed, in, the, early, 1890s, originally, conceived, as, a, mythological, opera, veneen, luominen, the, building, of, the, boat, on, a, scale, matching, those, by, richard, wagner, sibelius, later, changed, his, musical, goals, and, the, work, became, an, orchestral, piece, in, four, movements, the, suite, is, based, on, the, character, lemmink, inen, from, the, finnish, national, epic, the, kalevala, it, can, also, be, considered, a, collection, of, symphonic, poems, the, second, third, section, the, swan, of, tuonela, is, often, heard, separately, finlandia, probably, the, best, known, of, all, sibelius, s, works, is, a, highly, patriotic, piece, first, performed, in, november, 1899, as, one, of, the, tableaux, for, the, finnish, press, celebrations, it, had, its, public, premiere, in, revised, form, in,

sibelius, insisted, it, was, primarily, an, orchestral, piece, it, became, a, world, favourite, for, choirs, too, especially, for, the, hymn, episode, finally, the, composer, consented, and, in, 1937, and, 1940, agreed, to, words, for, the, hymn, first, for, the, freemasons, and, later, for, more, general, use, the, oceanides, is, a, single, movement, tone, poem, for, orchestra, written, in, 1913,

sibelius, himself, conducting, the, work, in, d, major, praised, upon, its, premiere, as, the, finest, evocation, of, the, sea, ever, produced, in, music, consists, of, two, subjects, sibelius, gradually, develops, in, three, informal, stages, first, a, placid, ocean, second, a, gathering, storm, and, third, a, thunderous, wave, crash, climax, as, the, tempest, subsides, a, final, chord, sounds, symbolizing, the, mighty, power, and, limitless, expanse, of, the, sea, tapiola, sibelius, s, last, major, orchestral, work, was, commissioned, by, walter, damrosch, for, the, new, york,

out, to, be, sibelius, s, most, severe, and, concentrated, musical, statement, even, more, emphatically, the, composer, and, biographer, cecil, gray, asserts, even, if, sibelius, had, written, nothing, else, this, one, work, would, entitle, him, to, a, place, among, the, greatest, masters, of, all, time, the, karelia, music, one, of, the, composer, s, earlier, works, written, for, the, vyborg, students, association, was, first, performed, on, 13, november, 1893, to, a, noisy, audience, the, suite, emerged, from, a, concert, on, 23, november, consisting, of, the, overture, and, the,

known, as, a, separate, concert, piece, sibelius, wrote, six, pieces, for, the, 2, december, 1903, production, of, kuolema, the, waltz, accompanied, a, sequence, in, which, a, woman, rises, from, her,

took, on, a, life, of, its, own, and, remains, one, of, sibelius, s, signature, pieces, the, violin, concerto, in, d, minor, was, first, performed, on, 8, february, 1904, with, victor, nov, ek, as, soloist, as, sibelius, had, barely, completed, the, piece, in, time, for, the, premiere, nov, ek, had, insufficient, time, to, prepare, with, the, result, that, the, performance, was, a, disaster, after, substantial, revisions, a, new, version, was, premiered, on, 19, october, 1905, with, richard, strauss, conducting, the, berlin, court, orchestra, with, karel, hal, the, orchestra, s, leader, as, soloist, it, was, a, tremendous, success, the, piece, has, become, increasingly, popular, and, is, now, the, most, frequently, recorded, of, all, the, violin, concertos, composed, in, the, 20th, century, kullervo, one, of, sibelius, s, early, works, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, choral, symphony, but, is, better, described, as, a, suite, of, five, symphonic, movements, resembling, tone, poems, based, on, the, character, kullervo, from, the, kalevala, it, was, premiered, on, 28, april, 1892, with, emmy, acht, and, abraham, ojanper, as, soloists, and, sibelius, conducting, the, chorus, and, orchestra, of, the, recently, founded, helsinki, orchestra, society, although, the, work, was, only, performed, five, times, during, the, composer, s, lifetime, since, the, 1990s, it, has, become, increasingly, popular, both, for, live, performances, and, recordings, when, freemasonry, in, finland, was, revived, having, been, forbidden, under, the, russian, reign, sibelius, was, one, of, the, founding, members, of, suomi, lodge, no, 1, in, 1922, and, later, became, the, grand, organist, of, the, grand, lodge, of, finland, he, composed, the, ritual, music, used, in, finland, op, 113, in, 1927, and, added, two, new, pieces, composed, in, 1946, the, new, revision, of, the, ritual, music, of, 1948, is, one, of, his, last, works, sibelius, attended, six, sessions, of, the, lodge, during, its, first, year, of, operation, these, visits, became, less, frequent, in, the, following, years, his, name, no, longer, appears, in, the, minutes, of, the, suomi, lodge, after, january, 1927, sibelius, loved, nature, and, the, finnish, landscape, often, served, as, material, for, his, music, he, once, said, of, his, sixth, symphony, always, reminds, me, of, the, scent, of, the, first, snow, the, forests, surrounding, ainola, are, often, said, to, have, inspired, his, composition, of, tapiola, on, the, subject, of, sibelius, s, ties, to, nature, his, biographer, tawaststjerna, wrote, even, by, nordic, standards, sibelius, responded, with, exceptional, intensity, to, the, moods, of, nature, and, the, changes, in, the, seasons, he, scanned, the, skies, with, his, binoculars, for, the, geese, flying, over, the, lake, ice, listened, to, the, screech, of, the, cranes, and, heard, the, cries, of, the, curlew, echo, over, the, marshy, grounds, just, below, ainola, he, savoured, the, spring, blossoms, every, bit, as, much, as, he, did, autumnal, scents, and, colours, the, composer, and, academic, elliott, schwartz, wrote, 1964, it, may, be, said, with, truth, that, vaughan, williams, sibelius, and, prokofieff, are, the, symphonists, of, this, century, indeed, sibelius, exerted, considerable, influence, on, symphonic, composers, and, musical, life, his, impact, is, perhaps, the, greatest, in, english, speaking, and, nordic, countries, the, finnish, symphonist, leevi, madetoja, was, a, pupil, of, sibelius, for, more, on, their, relationship, see, relationship, with, sibelius, in, britain, ralph, vaughan, williams, and, arnold, bax, both, dedicated, their, fifth, symphonies, to, sibelius, vaughan, williams, said, of, him, you, have, lit, a, candle, in, the, world, of, music, that, will, never, go, out, furthermore, tapiola, is, prominently, echoed, in, both, bax, s, sixth, symphony, and, ernest, john, moeran, s, symphony, in, g, minor, the, influence, of, sibelius, s, compositional, procedures, is, also, strongly, felt, in, the, first, symphony, of, william, walton, when, these, and, several, other, major, british, symphonic, essays, were, being, written, in, and, around, the, 1930s, sibelius, s, music, was, very, much, in, vogue, with, conductors, like, thomas, beecham, and, john, barbirolli, championing, its, cause, both, in, the, concert, hall, and, on, record, walton, s, composer, friend, constant, lambert, even, asserted, that, sibelius, was, the, first, great, composer, since, beethoven, whose, mind, thinks, naturally, in, terms, of, symphonic, form, earlier, granville, bantock, had, championed, sibelius, the, esteem, was, mutual, sibelius, dedicated, his, third, symphony, to, the, english, composer, and, in, 1946, he, became, the, first, president, of, the, bantock, society, more, recently, sibelius, was, also, one, of, the, composers, championed, by, robert, simpson, malcolm, arnold, acknowledged, his, influence, and, arthur, butterworth, also, saw, sibelius, s, music, as, a, source, of, inspiration, in, his, work, new, zealand, s, most, accomplished, 20th, century, composer, douglas, lilburn, wrote, of, the, inspiration, he, derived, from, sibelius, s, work, particularly, for, his, earlier, compositions, eugene, ormandy, and, to, a, lesser, extent, his, predecessor, with, the, philadelphia, orchestra, leopold, stokowski, were, instrumental, in, bringing, sibelius, s, music, to, american, audiences, by, frequently, programming, his, works, the, former, developed, a, friendly, relationship, with, sibelius, throughout, his, life, later, in, life, sibelius, was, championed, by, the, american, critic, olin, downes, who, wrote, a, biography, of, the, composer, in, 1938, theodor, adorno, wrote, a, critical, essay, notoriously, charging, that, if, sibelius, is, good, this, invalidates, the, standards, of, musical, quality, that, have, persisted, from, bach, to, schoenberg, the, richness, of, inter, connectedness, articulation, unity, in, diversity, the, multi, faceted, in, the, one, adorno, sent, his, essay, to, virgil, thomson, then, music, critic, of, the, new, york, herald, tribune, who, was, also, critical, of, sibelius, thomson, while, agreeing, with, the, essay, s, sentiment, declared, to, adorno, that, the, tone, of, it, more, apt, to, create, antagonism, toward, than, toward, sibelius, later, the, composer, theorist, and, conductor, ren, leibowitz, went, so, far, as, to, describe, sibelius, as, the, worst, composer, in, the, world, in, the, title, of, a, 1955, pamphlet, perhaps, one, reason, sibelius, has, attracted, both, the, praise, and, the, ire, of, critics, is, that, in, each, of, his, seven, symphonies, he, approached, the, basic, problems, of, form, tonality, and, architecture, in, unique, individual, ways, on, the, one, hand, his, symphonic, and, tonal, creativity, was, novel, while, others, thought, that, music, should, be, taking, a, different, route, sibelius, s, response, to, criticism, was, dismissive, pay, no, attention, to, what, critics, say, no, statue, has, ever, been, put, up, to, a, critic, in, the, latter, decades, of, the, twentieth, century, sibelius, became, seen, more, favourably, milan, kundera, said, the, composer, s, approach, was, that, of, antimodern, modernism, standing, outside, the, status, quo, of, perpetual, progress, in, a, similar, vein, the, philosopher, slavoj, i, ek, contrasts, sibelius, to, the, modernist, approach, of, schoenberg, and, the, post, modernist, one, of, stravinsky, for, i, ek, sibelius, represents, the, alternative, of, persistent, traditionalism, of, continuing, in, the, inherited, tradition, but, with, artistic, integrity, not, as, a, phony, conservative, in, 1990, the, composer, thea, musgrave, was, commissioned, by, the, helsinki, philharmonic, orchestra, to, write, a, piece, in, honour, of, the, 125th, anniversary, of, sibelius, s, birth, song, of, the, enchanter, premiered, on, 14, february, 1991, in, 1984, the, american, avant, garde, composer, morton, feldman, gave, a, lecture, in, darmstadt, germany, wherein, he, stated, that, the, people, you, think, are, radicals, might, really, be, conservatives, the, people, you, think, are, conservatives, might, really, be, radical, whereupon, he, began, to, hum, sibelius, s, fifth, symphony, writing, in, 1996, the, pulitzer, prize, winning, music, critic, tim, page, stated, there, are, two, things, to, be, said, straightaway, about, sibelius, first, he, is, terribly, uneven, much, of, his, chamber, music, a, lot, of, his, songs, and, most, of, his, piano, music, might, have, been, churned, out, by, a, second, rate, salon, composer, from, the, 19th, century, on, an, off, afternoon, second, at, his, very, best, he, is, often, weird, pianist, leif, ove, andsnes, offers, a, counterweight, to, page, s, assessment, of, sibelius, s, piano, music, acknowledging, that, this, body, of, work, is, uneven, in, quality, andsnes, believes, that, the, common, critical, dismissal, is, unwarranted, in, performing, selected, piano, works, andsnes, finds, that, audiences, were, astonished, that, there, could, be, a, major, composer, out, there, with, such, beautiful, accessible, music, that, people, don, t, know, for, the, 150th, anniversary, of, sibelius,
