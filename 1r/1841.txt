credited, this, achievement, to, the, technical, advice, that, he, received, from, luz, long, the, german, competitor, whom, he, defeated, but, later, admitted, that, this, was, not, true, as, he, and, long, did, not, meet, until, after, the, competition, was, over, on, august, 5, he, won, the, 200, m, sprint, with, a, time, of, 20, 7, seconds, defeating, teammate, mack, robinson, the, older,

left, the, stadium, international, olympic, committee, president, henri, de, baillet, latour, insisted, that, hitler, greet, every, medalist, or, none, at, all, hitler, opted, for, the, latter, and, skipped, all, further, medal, presentations, owens, first, competed, on, day, 2, august, 2, running, in, the, first, 10, 30, a, m, and, second, 3, 00, p, m, qualifying, rounds, for, the, 100, meters, final, he, equaled, the, olympic, and, world, record, in, the, first, race, and, broke, them, in, the, second, race, but, the, new, time, was, not, recognized, because, it, was, wind, assisted, later, the, same, day, owens, s, african, american, team, mate, cornelius, johnson, won, gold, in, the, high, jump, final, which, began, at, 5, 00, p, m, with, a, new, olympic, record, of, 2, 03, meters, hitler, did, not, publicly, congratulate, any, of, the, medal, winners, this, time, even, so, the, communist, new, york, city, newspaper, the, daily, worker, claimed, hitler, received, all, the, track, winners, except, johnson, and, left, the, stadium, as, a, deliberate, snub, after, watching, johnson, s, winning, jump, hitler, was, subsequently, accused, of, failing, to, acknowledge, owens, who, won, gold, medals, on, august, 3, 4, two, and, 9, or, shake, his, hand, owens, responded, to, these, claims, at, the, time, hitler, had, a, certain, time, to, come, to, the, stadium, and, a, certain, time, to, leave, it, happened, he, had, to, leave, before, the, victory, ceremony, after, the, 100, meters, but, before, he, left, i, was, on, my, way, to, a, broadcast, and, passed, near, his, box, he, waved, at, me, and, i, waved, back, i, think, it, was, bad, taste, to, criticize, the, man, of, the, hour, in, another, country, in, an, article, dated, august, 4, 1936, the, african, american, newspaper, editor, robert, l, vann, describes, witnessing, hitler, salute, owens, for, having, won, gold, in, the, 100m, sprint, august, 3, and, then, wonder, of, wonders, i, saw, herr, adolph, hitler, salute, this, lad, i, looked, on, with, a, heart, which, beat, proudly, as, the, lad, who, was, crowned, king, of, the, 100, meters, event, get, an, ovation, the, like, of, which, i, have, never, heard, before, i, saw, jesse, owens, greeted, by, the, grand, chancellor, of, this, country, as, a, brilliant, sun, peeped, out, through, the, clouds, i, saw, a, vast, crowd, of, some, 85, 000, or, 90, 000, people, stand, up, and, cheer, him, to, the, echo, in, 2014, eric, brown, british, fighter, pilot, and, test, pilot, aged, 17, in, 1936, and, later, becoming, the, fleet, air, arm, s, most, decorated, pilot, stated, in, a, bbc, documentary, i, actually, witnessed, hitler, shaking, hands, with, jesse, owens, and, congratulating, him, on, what, he, had, achieved, additionally, an, article, in, the, baltimore, sun, in, august, 1936, reported, that, hitler, sent, owens, a, commemorative, inscribed, cabinet, photograph, of, himself, later, on, october, 15, 1936, owens, repeated, this, claim, when, he, addressed, an, audience, of, african, americans, at, a, republican, rally, in, kansas, city, remarking, hitler, didn, t, snub, me, it, was, our, president, who, snubbed, me, the, president, didn, t, even, send, me, a, telegram, owens, s, success, at, the, games, caused, consternation, for, hitler, who, was, using, them, to, show, the, world, a, resurgent, nazi, germany, he, and, other, government, officials, had, hoped, that, german, athletes, would, dominate, the, games, nazi, minister, albert, speer, wrote, that, hitler, was, highly, annoyed, by, the, series, of, triumphs, by, the, marvelous, colored, american, runner, jesse, owens, people, whose, antecedents, came, from, the, jungle, were, primitive, hitler, said, with, a, shrug, their, physiques, were, stronger, than, those, of, civilized, whites, and, hence, should, be, excluded, from, future, games, in, germany, owens, had, been, allowed, to, travel, with, and, stay, in, the, same, hotels, as, whites, at, a, time, when, african, americans, in, many, parts, of, the, united, states, had, to, stay, in, segregated, hotels, that, accommodated, only, blacks, when, owens, returned, to, the, united, states, he, was, greeted, in, new, york, city, by, mayor, fiorello, la, guardia, during, a, manhattan, ticker, tape, parade, in, his, honor, along, broadway, s, canyon, of, heroes, someone, handed, owens, a, paper, bag, owens, paid, it, little, mind, until, the, parade, concluded, when, he, opened, it, up, he, found, that, the, bag, contained, 10, 000, in, cash, equivalent, to, 220, 000, in, 2023, owens, s, wife, ruth, later, said, and, he, didn, t, know, who, was, good, enough, to, do, a, thing, like, that, and, with, all, the, excitement, around, he, didn, t, pick, it, up, right, away, he, didn, t, pick, it, up, until, he, got, ready, to, get, out, of, the, car, after, the, parade, owens, was, not, permitted, to, enter, through, the, main, doors, of, the, waldorf, astoria, new, york, and, instead, forced, to, travel, up, to, the, reception, honoring, him, in, a, freight, elevator, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, fdr, never, invited, jesse, owens, to, the, white, house, following, his, triumphs, at, the, olympic, games, when, the, democrats, bid, for, his, support, owens, rejected, those, overtures, as, a, staunch, republican, he, endorsed, alf, landon, roosevelt, s, republican, opponent, in, the, 1936, presidential, race, owens, was, employed, to, do, campaign, outreach, for, african, american, votes, for, landon, in, the, 1936, presidential, election, owens, was, quoted, saying, the, secret, behind, his, success, was, i, let, my, feet, spend, as, little, time, on, the, ground, as, possible, from, the, air, fast, down, and, from, the, ground, fast, up, after, the, games, had, ended, the, entire, olympic, team, was, invited, to, compete, in, sweden, owens, decided, to, capitalize, on, his, success, by, returning, to, the, united, states, to, take, up, some, of, the, more, lucrative, endorsement, offers, united, states, athletic, officials, were, furious, and, withdrew, his, amateur, status, which, immediately, ended, his, career, owens, was, angry, and, stated, that, a, fellow, desires, something, for, himself, owens, argued, that, the, racial, discrimination, he, had, faced, throughout, his, athletic, career, such, as, not, being, eligible, for, scholarships, in, college, and, therefore, being, unable, to, take, classes, between, training, and, working, to, pay, his, way, meant, he, had, to, give, up, on, amateur, athletics, in, pursuit, of, financial, gain, elsewhere, following, the, 1936, olympics, where, owens, won, four, gold, medals, racism, back, home, led, to, difficulty, earning, a, living, despite, his, international, acclaim, owens, struggled, to, find, work, and, took, on, menial, jobs, as, a, gas, station, attendant, playground, janitor, and, manager, of, a, dry, cleaning, firm, and, at, times, resorted, to, racing, against, motorbikes, cars, trucks, and, horses, for, a, cash, prize, people, say, it, was, degrading, for, an, olympic, champion, to, run, against, a, horse, but, what, was, i, supposed, to, do, i, had, four, gold, medals, but, you, can, t, eat, four, gold, medals, owens, was, prohibited, from, making, appearances, at, amateur, sporting, events, to,

consolidated, artists, but, found, it, unfulfilling, he, also, made, appearances, at, baseball, games, and, other, events, owens, was, involved, politically, and, lent, his, support, to, the, republican, party, and, alf, landon, in, the, 1936, united, states, presidential, election, saying, that, adolf, hitler, congratulated, him, but, that, he, was, snubbed, by, president, franklin,

by, the, starter, s, shotgun, and, give, him, a, bad, jump, on, the, lack, of, opportunities, owens, added, there, was, no, television, no, big, advertising, no, endorsements, then, not, for, a,
