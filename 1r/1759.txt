rocket, engineer, and, spacecraft, designer, during, the, space, race, between, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1950s, and, 1960s, he, invented, the, r, 7, rocket, sputnik, 1, and, was, involved, in, the, launching, of, laika, sputnik, 3, the, first, human, made, object, to, make, contact, with, another, celestial, body, belka, and, strelka, the, first, human, being, yuri, gagarin, into, space, voskhod, 1, and, the, first, person, alexei, leonov, to, conduct, a, spacewalk, although, korolev, trained, as, an, aircraft, designer, his, greatest, strengths, proved, to, be, in, design, integration, organization, and, strategic, planning, arrested, on, a, false, official, charge, as, a, member, of, an, anti, soviet, counter, revolutionary, organization, which, would, later, be, reduced, to, saboteur, of, military, technology, he, was, imprisoned, in, 1938, for, almost, six, years, including, a, few, months, in, a, kolyma, labour, camp, following, his, release, he, became, a, recognized, rocket, designer, and, the, key, figure, in, the, development, of, the, soviet, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, program, he, later, directed, the, soviet, space, program, and, was, made, a, member, of, soviet, academy, of, sciences, overseeing, the, early, successes, of, the, sputnik, and, vostok, projects, including, the, first, human, earth, orbit, mission, by, yuri, gagarin, on, 12, april, 1961, korolev, s, unexpected, death, in, 1966, interrupted, implementation, of, his, plans, for, a, soviet, crewed, moon, landing, before, the, united, states, 1969, mission,

having, the, famous, aircraft, designer, andrei, tupolev, as, his, mentor, who, was, a, professor, there, korolev, studied, specialized, aviation, topics, until, 1929, while, living, with, his, family, in, the, typically, crowded, conditions, of, moscow, korolev, enjoyed, opportunities, to, fly, gliders, and, powered, aircraft, during, this, part, of, his, education, he, designed, a, glider, in, 1928, and, flew, it, in, a, competition, the, next, year, the, communist, party, accelerated, the, education, of, engineers, in, 1929, to, meet, the, country, s, urgent, need, for, their, skills, korolev, obtained, a, diploma, by, producing, a, practical, aircraft, design, by, the, end, of, the, year, after, graduation, korolev, worked, with, some, of, the, best, soviet, designers, at, the, 4th, experimental, section, aircraft, design, bureau, opo, 4, headed, by, paul, aim, richard, who, emigrated, to, the, ussr, from, france, in, the, 1920s, he, did, not, stand, out, in, this, group, but, while, so, employed, he, also, worked, independently, to, design, a, glider, capable, of, performing, aerobatics, in, 1930, he, became, interested, in, the, possibilities, of, liquid, fueled, rocket, engines, to, propel, airplanes, while, working, at, the, central, aerohydrodynamic, institute, tsagi, as, a, lead, engineer, on, the, tupolev, tb, 3, heavy, bomber, korolev, earned, his, pilot, s, license, in, 1930, and, explored, the, operational, limits, of, the, aircraft, he, piloted, wondering, what, was, beyond, his, plane, s, altitude, limit, and, how, he, could, get, there, many, believe, this, was, the, start, of, his, interest, in, space, korolev, married, xenia, vincentini, on, 6, august, 1931, he, had, first, proposed, marriage, to, her, in, 1924, but, she, then, declined, so, she, might, continue, her, higher, education, in, 1931, korolev, and, space, travel, enthusiast, friedrich, zander, participated, in, the, creation, of, the, group, for, the, study, of, reactive, motion, gird, one, of, the, earliest, state, sponsored, centers, for, rocket, development, in, the, ussr, while, there, he, met, mikhail, tikhonravov, a, glider, pilot, and, aerospace, engineer, who, would, later, work, under, korolev, s, sputnik, group, in, may, 1932, korolev, was, appointed, chief, of, the, group, and, military, interest, encouraged, funding, of, group, projects, on, august, 18, 1933, gird, launched, the, first, hybrid, propellant, rocket, the, gird, 09, and, on, november, 25, 1933, the, soviet, s, first, liquid, fueled, rocket, gird, x, growing, military, interest, in, this, new, technology, caused, gird, to, be, merged, with, the, gas, dynamics, laboratory, gdl, at, leningrad, in, 1933, to, create, the, reactive, scientific, research, institute, rnii, which, brought, together, the, best, of, the, soviet, rocket, talent, including, korolev, georgy, langemak, and, former, gdl, engine, designer, valentin, glushko, korolev, was, appointed, deputy, head, under, ivan, kleymyonov, however, in, 1934, following, a, disagreement, over, the, direction, of, rnii, korolev, was, demoted, to, section, chief, of, winged, missiles, and, was, replaced, by, georgy, langemak, korolev, supervised, development, of, cruise, missiles, and, a, crewed, rocket, powered, glider, rocket, flight, in, stratosphere, was, published, by, korolev, in, 1934, on, 10, april, 1935, korolev, s, wife, gave, birth, to, their, daughter, natalya, and, they, moved, out, of, sergei, s, parents, home, and, into, their, own, apartment, in, 1936, both, korolev, and, his, wife, had, careers, and, sergei, always, spent, long, hours, at, his, design, office, joseph, stalin, s, great, purge, severely, damaged, rnii, with, director, kleymyonov, and, chief, engineer, langemak, arrested, in, november, 1937, tortured, made, to, sign, false, confessions, and, executed, in, january, 1938, glushko, was, arrested, in, march, 1938, and, with, many, other, leading, engineers, was, imprisoned, in, the, gulag, korolev, was, arrested, by, the, nkvd, on, 27, june, 1938, after, being, accused, of, a, variety, of, charges, including, false, charges, extracted, from, kleymyonov, langemak, and, glushko, he, was, tortured, in, the, lubyanka, prison, to, extract, a, confession, glushko, and, korolev, had, reportedly, been, denounced, by, andrei, kostikov, who, became, the, head, of, rnii, after, its, leadership, was, arrested, korolev, was, sent, to, prison, where, he, wrote, many, appeals, to, the, authorities, including, stalin, himself, following, the, fall, of, nkvd, head, nikolai, yezhov, the, new, chief, lavrenti, beria, chose, to, retry, korolev, on, reduced, charges, in, 1939, but, by, that, time, korolev, was, on, his, way, from, prison, to, a, gulag, forced, labour, camp, in, kolyma, in, the, far, east, of, siberia, where, he, spent, several, months, in, a, gold, mine, before, word, reached, him, of, his, retrial, work, camp, conditions, of, inadequate, food, shelter, and, clothing, killed, thousands, of, prisoners, each, month, korolev, sustained, injuries, including, possibly, a, heart, attack, and, lost, most, of, his, teeth, from, scurvy, before, being, returned, to, moscow, in, late, 1939, when, he, reached, moscow, korolev, s, sentence, was, reduced, to, eight, years, however, due, to, the, intervention, by, his, old, mentor, andrei, tupolev, he, was, relocated, to, a, prison, for, scientists, and, engineers, in, september, 1940, these, were, labor, camps, where, scientists, and, engineers, worked, on, projects, assigned, by, the, communist, party, leadership, the, central, design, bureau, 29, ckb, 29, 29, of, the, nkvd, served, as, tupolev, s, engineering, facility, and, korolev, was, brought, here, to, work, during, world, war, ii, this, sharashka, designed, both, the, tupolev, tu, 2, bomber, and, the, petlyakov, pe, 2, dive, bomber, the, group, was, moved, several, times, during, the, war, the, first, time, to, avoid, capture, by, advancing, german, forces, korolev, was, moved, in, 1942, to, the, sharashka, of, kazan, okb, 16, under, glushko, korolev, and, glushko, designed, the, rd, 1, khz, auxiliary, rocket, motor, tested, in, an, unsuccessful, fast, climb, lavochkin, la, 7r, korolev, was, isolated, from, his, family, until, 27, june, 1944, when, he, along, with, tupolev, glushko, and, others, was, finally, discharged, by, special, government, decree, although, the, charges, against, him, were, not, dropped, until, 1957, korolev, rarely, talked, about, his, experience, in, the, gulag, and, lived, under, constant, fear, of, being, executed, for, the, military, secrets, he, possessed, he, was, deeply, affected, by, his, time, in, the, camp, becoming, reserved, and, cautious, as, a, result, he, later, learned, that, glushko, was, one, of, his, accusers, and, this, was, likely, the, cause, of, the, lifelong, animosity, between, the, two, men, the, design, bureau, was, handed, over, from, nkvd, control, to, the, government, s, aviation, industry, commission, korolev, continued, working, with, the, bureau, for, another, year, serving, as, deputy, designer, under, glushko, and, studying, various, rocket, designs, korolev, was, commissioned, into, the, red, army, with, the, rank, of, colonel, in, 1945, his, first, military, decoration, was, the, badge, of, honor, awarded, in, 1945, for, his, work, on, the, development, of, rocket, motors, for, military, aircraft, on, 8, september, 1945, korolev, was, brought, to, germany, along, with, many, other, experts, to, recover, the, technology, of, the, german, v, 2, rocket, the, soviets, worked, with, german, specialists, to, understand, and, replicate, the, rocket, technology, placing, a, priority, on, recreating, the, entire, german, v, 2, rocket, in, february, 1946, the, institute, nordhausen, was, formed, with, korolev, as, chief, engineer, glushko, as, head, of, engine, assembly, and, propulsion, systems, and, german, helmut, gr, ttrup, who, previously, worked, with, wernher, von, braun, as, general, director, the, work, continued, in, east, germany, until, late, 1946, when, 2, 000, german, scientists, and, engineers, were, sent, to, the, ussr, through, operation, osoaviakhim, most, of, the, german, experts, gr, ttrup, being, an, exception, had, not, worked, directly, with, wernher, von, braun, many, of, the, leading, german, rocket, scientists, including, dr, von, braun, himself, surrendered, to, americans, and, were, transported, to, the, united, states, as, part, of, operation, paperclip, stalin, made, rocket, and, missile, development, a, national, priority, upon, signing, a, decree, on, 13, may, 1946, and, a, new, institute, called, scientific, research, institute, no, 88, nii, 88, was, created, for, that, purpose, in, the, suburbs, of, moscow, development, of, ballistic, missiles, was, placed, under, the, military, control, of, dmitriy, ustinov, through, the, decree, signed, by, stalin, and, ustinov, appointed, korolev, as, chief, designer, of, long, range, missiles, at, department, no, 3, of, nii, 88, during, this, period, korolev, demonstrated, his, organisation, and, management, capabilities, by, organising, a, council, of, chief, designers, which, assisted, in, circumnavigating, the, bureaucratic, hierarchy, of, the, soviet, missile, industry, this, group, eventually, assumed, engineering, control, over, the, early, soviet, space, program, korolev, returned, from, germany, in, february, 1947, and, took, up, his, duties, as, chief, designer, and, head, of, department, no, 3, of, nii, 88, initially, tasked, with, reproduction, of, the, v, 2, the, soviets, were, only, able, to, obtain, parts, to, assemble, approximately, a, dozen, v, 2, rockets, so, the, decision, was, made, to, replicate, a, soviet, version, which, was, designated, the, r, 1, initially, korolev, opposed, this, decision, as, he, thought, it, was, a, waste, of, time, and, they, should, move, immediately, to, manufacture, a, more, advanced, version, which, had, been, designated, the, r, 2, however, korolev, was, overruled, and, was, ordered, to, assemble, what, v, 2s, they, had, for, flight, testing, then, create, the, r, 1, using, soviet, infrastructure, and, materials, nii, 88, also, incorporated, 170, german, specialists, including, helmut, gr, ttrup, and, fritz, karl, preikschat, with, approximately, half, based, at, branch, 1, of, nii, 88, on, gorodomlya, island, in, lake, seliger, some, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, from, moscow, the, germans, provided, a, variety, of, support, to, the, soviet, efforts, particularly, on, assembling, the, v, 2, and, creating, the, r, 1, the, first, soviet, tests, of, v, 2, rockets, took, place, in, october, 1947, at, kapustin, yar, with, korolev, as, management, lead, for, the, project, numerous, german, engineers, also, participated, in, the, tests, a, total, of, 11, v, 2, rockets, were, launched, with, 5, reaching, their, designated, targets, in, september, 1948, testing, of, the, r, 1, began, at, kapustin, yar, where, korolev, was, a, formal, member, of, the, state, commission, for, testing, the, r, 1, no, germans, participated, in, these, tests, which, launched, 9, rockets, between, september, and, november, 1948, korolev, continued, to, lobby, for, the, design, and, construction, of, the, r, 2, including, meeting, with, stalin, in, april, 1947, but, faced, competition, from, a, proposal, from, the, germans, called, the, g, 1, whilst, the, german, proposal, was, initially, supported, by, soviet, management, korolev, opposed, utilising, german, specialists, for, personal, reasons, and, basically, ignored, their, suggestions, and, advice, due, to, political, and, security, concerns, german, specialists, were, not, allowed, knowledge, or, access, to, any, soviet, missile, design, and, in, december, 1948, work, on, the, g, 1, proposal, was, terminated, the, ministry, of, defence, decided, to, dissolve, the, german, team, in, 1950, and, repatriated, the, german, engineers, and, their, families, between, december, 1951, and, november, 1953, in, april, 1948, the, go, ahead, for, scientific, and, experimental, work, was, approved, which, led, to, the, creation, of, the, r, 2, the, r, 2, doubled, the, range, of, the, v, 2, and, was, the, first, design, to, utilize, a, separable, warhead, this, was, followed, by, the, r, 3, which, had, a, range, of, 3, 000, kilometres, 1, 900, mi, and, thus, could, target, england, glushko, couldn, t, obtain, the, required, thrust, from, the, r, 3, engines, so, the, project, was, canceled, in, 1952, and, korolev, joined, the, soviet, communist, party, that, year, to, request, money, from, the, government, for, future, projects, including, the, r, 5, with, a, more, modest, 1, 200, kilometres, 750, mi, range, it, completed, a, first, successful, flight, by, 1953, the, world, s, first, true, intercontinental, ballistic, missile, icbm, was, the, r, 7, semyorka, this, was, a, two, stage, rocket, with, a, maximum, payload, of, 5, 4, tons, sufficient, to, carry, the, soviets, bulky, nuclear, bomb, an, impressive, distance, of, 7, 000, kilometres, 4, 300, mi, during, the, summer, of, 1957, the, first, three, launches, of, the, r, 7, all, failed, severely, demoralizing, korolev, and, his, colleagues, the, failures, also, jeopardized, his, position, and, dream, of, using, an, r, 7, to, launch, an, artificial, satellite, in, the, future, the, fourth, test, completed, on, 21, august, 1957, was, finally, able, to, deliver, a, dummy, payload, to, the, kamchatka, peninsula, the, soviet, news, agency, tass, made, a, brief, announcement, about, the, icbm, s, success, but, it, was, largely, ignored, or, dismissed, by, members, of, the, american, public, and, media, because, of, korolev, s, success, with, the, r, 7, and, because, the, soviet, union, had, successfully, created, the, icbm, before, the, united, states, of, america, he, was, nationally, recognized, by, the, soviet, union, although, his, name, was, kept, secret, however, despite, the, soviet, r, 7, initial, success, it, experienced, later, failures, as, it, was, not, intended, to, be, a, practical, weapon, on, 19, april, 1957, korolev, was, declared, fully, rehabilitated, as, the, government, acknowledged, that, his, sentence, was, unjust, korolev, was, keenly, aware, of, the, orbital, possibilities, of, the, rockets, being, designed, as, icbms, ideas, that, were, shared, by, tikhonravov, then, working, at, nii, 4, on, 26, may, 1954, six, days, after, being, tasked, to, lead, the, r, 7, ballistic, missile, program, korolev, submitted, a, proposal, to, use, the, r, 7, to, launch, a, satellite, into, space, naming, a, technical, report, from, tikhonravov, and, mentioning, similar, work, being, carried, out, by, americans, after, receiving, lukewarm, support, from, the, soviet, leadership, korolev, initiated, a, modest, satellite, research, project, in, coordination, with, tikhonravov, to, intensify, his, lobbying, efforts, korolev, along, with, other, like, minded, engineers, began, writing, speculative, articles, for, soviet, newspapers, on, space, flight, they, were, picked, up, by, the, press, in, the, united, states, and, the, cia, influencing, american, authorities, to, start, their, own, satellite, programs, on, 29, july, 1955, the, eisenhower, administration, announced, the, intention, of, the, united, states, to, launch, small, earth, circling, satellites, for, the, international, geophysical, year, while, the, us, government, debated, the, idea, of, spending, millions, of, dollars, on, this, concept, korolev, suggested, the, international, prestige, of, launching, a, satellite, before, the, united, states, on, 5, august, he, sent, another, proposal, with, american, newspaper, articles, about, the, us, program, attached, three, days, later, the, soviet, leadership, approved, his, plan, on, 30, august, korolev, met, with, members, of, the, soviet, defense, and, scientific, communities, as, a, result, he, was, allowed, to, use, the, r, 7, rocket, to, launch, satellites, and, his, project, also, gained, support, from, the, soviet, academy, of, sciences, on, 30, january, 1956, the, ussr, council, of, ministers, officially, approved, the, satellite, project, in, its, decree, number, 149, 88ss, the, original, plan, for, the, satellite, called, for, a, sophisticated, scientific, laboratory, nicknamed, object, d, it, would, be, the, fifth, type, of, payload, built, for, the, r, 7, missile, despite, earlier, work, done, by, tikhonravov, much, of, its, design, such, as, pressurized, equipment, long, range, communications, systems, automated, switches, and, a, metal, construct, to, work, in, space, had, little, precedent, by, mid, 1956, korolev, had, finalized, the, modifications, to, the, r, 7, icbm, for, a, satellite, launch, but, the, project, as, a, whole, was, falling, behind, schedule, he, feared, that, the, united, states, would, launch, a, satellite, before, he, could, this, was, heightened, by, reports, of, the, american, project, vanguard, and, a, secret, 1956, missile, launch, from, patrick, air, force, base, florida, meanwhile, testing, of, the, r, 7, rocket, engine, showed, that, its, specific, impulse, would, be, lower, than, projected, and, thus, insufficient, for, object, d, s, specifications, korolev, sent, a, revised, plan, calling, for, a, simpler, payload, of, approximately, 100, kilograms, it, was, approved, on, 25, january, 1957, as, object, ps, despite, having, achieved, one, successful, flight, of, the, r, 7, rocket, korolev, still, faced, opposition, from, some, officials, to, his, plan, of, launching, a, satellite, in, august, 1957, he, proposed, letting, the, central, committee, make, the, call, because, no, one, wanted, to, risk, losing, the, prestige, to, the, united, states, korolev, s, satellite, launch, was, finally, approved, in, september, a, second, successful, flight, of, the, r, 7, was, made, and, 6, october, was, established, as, the, target, date, for, launching, ps, 1, the, first, of, the, object, ps, type, satellites, the, lead, designer, of, object, ps, was, mikhail, s, khomyakov, and, its, deputy, designer, was, oleg, g, ivanovskiy, it, was, constructed, in, less, than, a, month, by, the, tikhonravov, group, while, korolev, personally, managed, the, assembly, at, a, hectic, pace, the, satellite, was, a, simple, polished, metal, sphere, no, bigger, than, a, beach, ball, containing, batteries, that, powered, a, transmitter, using, four, external, communication, antennas, korolev, moved, the, launch, date, two, days, early, fearing, a, last, minute, launch, of, its, own, by, the, united, states, ps, 1, was, successfully, launched, into, space, on, 4, october, 1957, as, sputnik, 1, becoming, the, first, artificial, satellite, of, the, earth, for, security, reasons, the, names, of, chief, individuals, in, the, soviet, space, program, became, a, secret, they, were, allowed, to, prepare, a, report, detailing, the, design, and, construction, of, sputnik, 1, however, which, was, published, anonymously, by, pravda, on, 9, october, korolev, also, began, writing, other, articles, under, the, pseudonym, professor, k, sergeyev, the, soviet, government, initially, had, a, low, key, response, to, the, success, of, the, launch, international, reaction, was, electrifying, and, tumultuous, however, which, the, soviets, later, capitalized, on, political, ramifications, of, the, accomplishment, continued, for, decades, nikita, khrushchev, initially, bored, with, the, idea, of, another, korolev, rocket, launch, was, pleased, with, this, success, after, the, wide, recognition, and, encouraged, launch, of, a, more, sophisticated, satellite, less, than, a, month, later, in, time, for, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, october, revolution, on, 3, november, korolev, and, close, associate, mstislav, keldysh, wished, to, up, the, ante, of, building, a, second, larger, satellite, by, proposing, the, idea, of, putting, a, dog, on, board, which, sufficiently, caught, the, interest, of, the, soviet, academy, of, sciences, this, new, sputnik, 2, spacecraft, had, six, times, the, mass, of, the, sputnik, 1, and, carried, the, dog, laika, as, a, payload, the, entire, vehicle, was, designed, from, scratch, within, four, weeks, with, no, time, for, testing, or, quality, checks, it, was, successfully, launched, on, 3, november, and, laika, was, placed, in, orbit, there, was, no, mechanism, to, bring, the, dog, back, to, earth, the, dog, died, from, heat, exhaustion, after, five, hours, in, space, the, instrument, laden, sputnik, 3, spacecraft, was, launched, initially, on, 27, april, 1958, but, the, satellite, had, a, failure, with, the, engine, which, caused, the, satellite, to, fall, back, down, to, earth, in, separate, pieces, on, 15, may, 1958, sputnik, 3, was, successfully, launched, into, orbit, the, tape, recorder, that, was, to, store, the, data, failed, after, launch, as, a, result, the, discovery, and, mapping, of, the, van, allen, radiation, belts, was, left, to, the, united, states, explorer, 3, and, pioneer, 3, satellites, sputnik, 3, left, little, doubt, with, the, american, government, about, the, soviets, pending, icbm, capability, even, before, the, sputnik, 1, launch, korolev, was, interested, in, getting, to, the, moon, he, came, up, with, the, notion, to, modify, the, r, 7, missile, in, order, to, carry, a, package, to, the, moon, however, it, was, not, until, 1958, that, this, idea, was, approved, after, korolev, wrote, a, letter, explaining, that, his, current, technology, would, make, it, possible, to, get, to, the, moon, a, modified, version, of, the, r, 7, launch, vehicle, was, used, with, a, new, upper, stage, the, engine, for, this, final, stage, was, the, first, designed, to, be, fired, in, outer, space, mechta, is, the, russian, word, meaning, dream, and, this, is, the, name, korolev, called, his, moon, ships, officially, the, soviet, union, called, them, lunas, the, first, three, lunar, probes, launched, in, 1958, all, failed, in, part, because, of, political, pressure, forcing, the, launches, to, be, rushed, with, an, inadequate, budget, to, test, and, develop, the, hardware, properly, before, they, were, ready, to, fly, korolev, thought, political, infighting, in, moscow, was, responsible, for, the, lack, of, sufficient, funding, for, the, program, although, the, us, space, program, at, this, early, phase, also, had, a, scarcely, enviable, launch, record, once, when, pressured, to, beat, the, us, to, a, working, lunar, probe, korolev, allegedly, exclaimed, do, you, think, that, only, american, rockets, explode, the, luna, 1, mission, on, 2, january, 1959, was, intended, to, impact, the, surface, but, missed, by, about, 6, 000, kilometres, 3, 700, mi, nevertheless, this, probe, became, the, first, to, reach, escape, velocity, and, the, first, to, go, near, the, moon, as, well, as, becoming, the, first, man, made, object, to, orbit, the, sun, a, subsequent, attempt, luna, e, 1a, no, 1, failed, at, launch, and, then, luna, 2, successfully, impacted, the, surface, on, 14, september, 1959, giving, the, soviets, another, first, this, was, followed, just, one, month, later, by, an, even, greater, success, with, luna, 3, it, was, launched, only, two, years, after, sputnik, 1, and, on, 7, october, 1959, was, the, first, spacecraft, to, photograph, the, far, side, of, the, moon, which, was, something, the, people, of, earth, had, never, seen, beforehand, the, luna, missions, were, intended, to, make, a, successful, soft, landing, on, the, moon, but, korolev, was, unable, to, see, a, success, luna, 4, and, luna, 6, both, missed, luna, 5, luna, 7, and, luna, 8, all, crashed, on, the, moon, it, was, not, until, after, korolev, s, death, that, the, soviet, union, successfully, achieved, a, soft, landing, on, the, moon, with, luna, 9, towards, the, latter, part, of, korolev, s, life, he, had, been, working, on, projects, for, reaching, the, planets, mars, and, venus, and, even, had, spacecraft, ready, to, reach, both, the, united, states, was, also, working, towards, reaching, these, planets, so, it, was, a, race, to, see, who, would, be, successful, korolev, s, two, initial, mars, probes, suffered, from, engine, failures, and, the, five, probes, the, soviet, union, launched, in, hopes, of, reaching, venus, all, failed, between, 1961, and, 1962, korolev, himself, supervised, the, launches, of, all, probes, on, 1, november, 1962, the, soviet, union, successfully, launched, mars, 1, and, although, communications, failed, was, the, first, to, complete, a, flyby, of, mars, later, the, soviet, union, launched, venera, 3, which, was, the, first, impact, of, venus, it, was, not, until, after, korolev, s, death, that, the, soviet, union, impacted, mars, korolev, s, group, was, also, working, on, ambitious, programs, for, missions, to, mars, and, venus, putting, a, man, in, orbit, launching, communication, spy, and, weather, satellites, and, making, a, soft, landing, on, the, moon, a, radio, communication, center, needed, to, be, built, in, the, crimea, near, simferopol, and, near, yevpatoria, to, control, the, spacecraft, many, of, these, projects, were, not, realized, in, his, lifetime, and, none, of, the, planetary, probes, performed, a, completely, successful, mission, until, after, his, death, although, he, had, conceived, of, the, idea, as, early, as, 1948, korolev, s, planning, for, the, piloted, mission, began, in, 1958, with, design, studies, for, the, future, vostok, spacecraft, it, was, to, hold, a, single, passenger, in, a, space, suit, and, be, fully, automated, the, space, suit, unlike, the, united, states, pure, oxygen, system, was, 80, percent, nitrogen, and, only, 20, percent, oxygen, the, capsule, had, an, escape, mechanism, for, problems, prior, to, launch, and, a, soft, landing, and, ejection, system, during, the, recovery, the, spacecraft, was, spherical, just, like, the, sputnik, design, and, korolev, explained, his, reasoning, for, this, by, saying, the, spherical, shape, would, be, more, stable, dynamically, beginning, with, work, on, the, vostok, konstantin, feoktistov, was, recruited, directly, by, korolev, to, be, the, principal, designer, for, crewed, spaceflight, vehicles, on, 15, may, 1960, an, uncrewed, prototype, performed, 64, orbits, of, earth, but, the, reentry, maneuver, failed, on, 28, july, 1960, two, dogs, by, the, names, of, chaika, and, lishichka, were, launched, into, space, but, the, mission, was, unsuccessful, when, an, explosion, killed, the, dogs, however, on, 19, august, the, soviet, union, became, the, first, to, successfully, recover, living, creatures, back, to, earth, the, dogs, belka, and, strelka, were, successfully, launched, into, space, on, a, vostok, spacecraft, and, they, completed, eighteen, orbits, following, this, the, soviet, union, sent, a, total, of, six, dogs, into, space, two, in, pairs, and, two, paired, with, a, dummy, unfortunately, not, all, the, missions, were, successful, after, gaining, approval, from, the, government, a, modified, version, of, korolev, s, r, 7, was, used, to, launch, yuri, alexeevich, gagarin, into, orbit, on, 12, april, 1961, which, was, before, the, united, states, was, able, to, put, alan, shepard, into, space, korolev, served, as, capsule, coordinator, and, was, able, to, speak, to, gagarin, who, was, inside, the, capsule, the, first, human, in, space, and, earth, orbit, returned, to, earth, via, a, parachute, after, ejecting, at, an, altitude, of, 7, kilometres, 23, 000, ft, gagarin, was, followed, by, additional, vostok, flights, culminating, with, 81, orbits, completed, by, vostok, 5, and, the, launch, of, valentina, tereshkova, as, the, first, woman, cosmonaut, in, space, aboard, vostok, 6, korolev, proposed, communications, satellites, and, the, vostok, craft, was, a, spinoff, from, the, zenit, spy, satellite, useful, for, photographic, reconnaissance, and, vostok, had, its, defense, importance, acknowledged, by, the, military, korolev, planned, to, move, forward, with, soyuz, craft, able, to, dock, with, other, craft, in, orbit, and, exchange, crews, he, was, directed, by, khrushchev, to, cheaply, produce, more, firsts, for, the, piloted, program, including, a, multi, crewed, flight, korolev, was, reported, to, have, resisted, the, idea, as, the, vostok, was, a, one, man, spacecraft, and, the, three, man, soyuz, was, several, years, away, from, being, able, to, fly, khrushchev, was, not, interested, in, technical, excuses, and, let, it, be, known, that, if, korolev, could, not, do, it, he, would, give, the, work, to, his, rival, vladimir, chelomey, but, russian, space, web, describes, this, demand, by, khrushchev, as, a, legend, and, challenge, to, apollo, says, that, the, evidence, that, khrushchev, would, have, ordered, these, missions, does, not, survive, scrutiny, cosmonaut, alexei, leonov, described, the, authority, korolev, commanded, at, this, time, long, before, we, met, him, one, man, dominated, much, of, our, conversation, in, the, early, days, of, our, training, sergei, pavlovich, korolev, the, mastermind, behind, the, soviet, space, program, he, was, only, ever, referred, to, by, the, initials, of, his, first, two, names, sp, or, by, the, mysterious, title, of, chief, designer, or, simply, chief, for, those, on, the, space, program, there, was, no, authority, higher, korolev, had, the, reputation, of, being, a, man, of, the, highest, integrity, but, also, of, being, extremely, demanding, everyone, around, him, was, on, tenterhooks, afraid, of, making, a, wrong, move, and, invoking, his, wrath, he, was, treated, like, a, god, leonov, recalled, the, first, meeting, between, korolev, and, the, cosmonauts, i, was, looking, out, of, the, window, when, he, arrived, stepping, out, of, a, black, zis, 110, limousine, he, was, taller, than, average, i, could, not, see, his, face, but, he, had, a, short, neck, and, large, head, he, wore, the, collar, of, his, dark, blue, overcoat, turned, up, and, the, brim, of, his, hat, pulled, down, sit, down, my, little, eagles, he, said, as, he, strode, into, the, room, where, we, were, waiting, he, glanced, down, a, list, of, our, names, and, called, on, us, in, alphabetical, order, to, introduce, ourselves, briefly, and, talk, about, our, flying, careers, on, august, 11, 1962, korolyov, launched, the, first, group, flight, with, vostok, 3, and, 4, with, andriyan, nikolayev, and, pavel, popovich, the, two, spacecraft, approached, each, other, to, 6, 5, km, this, was, based, on, precise, calculations, already, at, launch, and, not, on, steering, maneuvering, of, the, spacecraft, during, the, flight, at, korolev, s, request, popovich, sang, the, ukrainian, song, watching, the, sky, and, thinking, a, thought, ukrainian, poem, by, mykhailo, petrenko, the, first, song, from, outer, space, the, voskhod, was, designed, as, an, incremental, improvement, on, the, vostok, to, meet, khruschev, s, goal, as, a, single, capsule, would, be, ineffective, for, proper, travel, to, the, moon, the, vehicle, needed, to, be, able, to, hold, more, people, khrushchev, ordered, korolev, to, launch, three, people, on, the, voskhod, capsule, quickly, as, the, united, states, was, already, doing, unmanned, tests, of, the, 2, person, gemini, korolev, accepted, on, the, condition, that, more, backing, would, be, given, to, his, n, 1, rocket, program, one, of, the, difficulties, in, the, design, of, the, voskhod, was, the, need, to, land, it, via, parachute, the, three, person, crew, could, not, bail, out, and, land, by, parachute, so, the, craft, would, need, much, larger, parachutes, in, order, to, land, safely, early, tests, with, the, craft, resulted, in, some, failures, until, use, of, stronger, fabric, improved, parachute, reliability, the, resulting, voskhod, was, a, stripped, down, vehicle, from, which, any, excess, weight, had, been, removed, although, a, backup, retrofire, engine, was, added, since, the, more, powerful, voskhod, rocket, used, to, launch, the, craft, would, send, it, to, a, higher, orbit, than, the, vostok, eliminating, the, possibility, of, a, natural, decay, of, the, orbit, and, reentry, in, case, of, primary, retrorocket, failure, after, one, uncrewed, test, flight, this, spacecraft, carried, a, crew, of, three, cosmonauts, komarov, yegorov, and, feoktistov, into, space, on, 12, october, 1964, and, completed, sixteen, orbits, this, craft, was, designed, to, perform, a, soft, landing, eliminating, a, need, for, the, ejection, system, but, the, crew, was, sent, into, orbit, without, space, suits, or, a, launch, abort, system, with, the, americans, planning, a, spacewalk, with, their, gemini, program, the, soviets, decided, to, trump, them, again, by, performing, a, spacewalk, on, the, second, voskhod, launch, after, rapidly, adding, an, airlock, the, voskhod, 2, was, launched, on, 18, march, 1965, and, alexei, leonov, performed, the, world, s, first, spacewalk, the, flight, very, nearly, ended, in, disaster, as, leonov, was, just, barely, able, to, re, enter, through, the, airlock, and, plans, for, further, voskhod, missions, were, shelved, in, the, meantime, the, change, of, soviet, leadership, with, the, fall, of, khrushchev, meant, that, korolev, was, back, in, favor, and, given, charge, of, beating, the, us, to, landing, a, man, on, the, moon, for, the, moon, race, korolev, s, staff, started, to, design, the, immense, n1, rocket, in, 1961, using, the, nk, 15, liquid, fuel, rocket, engine, he, also, was, working, on, the, design, for, the, soyuz, spacecraft, that, was, intended, to, carry, crews, to, leo, and, to, the, moon, as, well, korolev, was, designing, the, luna, series, of, vehicles, that, would, soft, land, on, the, moon, and, make, robotic, missions, to, mars, and, venus, unexpectedly, he, died, in, january, 1966, before, he, could, see, his, various, plans, brought, to, fruition, engineer, sergei, khrushchev, son, of, former, soviet, premier, nikita, khrushchev, explained, in, an, interview, some, of, the, shortcomings, he, discerned, in, korolev, s, approach, which, in, his, opinion, was, why, the, soviets, didn, t, land, on, the, moon, i, think, russia, had, no, chance, to, be, ahead, of, the, americans, under, sergei, korolev, and, his, successor, vasili, mishin, korolev, was, not, a, scientist, not, a, designer, he, was, a, brilliant, manager, korolev, s, problem, was, his, mentality, his, intent, was, to, somehow, use, the, launcher, he, had, it, was, designed, in, 1958, for, a, different, purpose, and, with, a, limited, payload, of, about, 70, tons, his, philosophy, was, let, s, not, work, by, stages, but, let, s, assemble, everything, and, then, try, it, and, at, last, it, will, work, there, were, several, attempts, and, failures, with, lunnik, sending, man, to, the, moon, is, too, complicated, too, complex, for, such, an, approach, i, think, it, was, doomed, from, the, very, beginning, another, reason, the, soviet, crewed, lunar, program, didn, t, succeed, was, the, rivalry, between, korolev, and, vladimir, chelomey, their, animosity, was, due, to, the, intolerable, persona, of, both, men, and, their, desire, for, leadership, at, any, cost, the, two, never, said, a, harsh, word, about, each, other, either, in, public, or, in, private, but, toppled, each, other, s, projects, in, any, way, possible, instead, of, dividing, competencies, and, responsibilities, and, cooperating, in, order, to, pursue, the, same, goal, the, two, struggled, for, leadership, in, the, space, program, according, to, khrushchev, who, worked, for, chelomey, and, knew, both, men, well, they, both, would, have, preferred, the, americans, to, land, on, the, moon, first, rather, than, their, rival, on, 3, december, 1960, korolev, suffered, his, first, heart, attack, during, his, convalescence, it, was, also, discovered, that, he, was, suffering, from, a, kidney, disorder, a, condition, brought, on, by, his, detention, in, the, soviet, prison, camps, he, was, warned, by, the, doctors, that, if, he, continued, to, work, as, intensely, as, he, had, he, would, not, live, long, korolev, became, convinced, that, khrushchev, was, only, interested, in, the, space, program, for, its, propaganda, value, and, feared, that, he, would, cancel, it, entirely, if, the, soviets, started, losing, their, leadership, to, the, united, states, so, he, continued, to, push, himself, by, 1962, korolev, s, health, problems, were, beginning, to, accumulate, and, he, was, suffering, from, numerous, ailments, he, had, a, bout, of, intestinal, bleeding, that, led, to, him, being, taken, to, the, hospital, in, an, ambulance, in, 1964, doctors, diagnosed, him, with, cardiac, arrhythmia, in, february, he, spent, ten, days, in, the, hospital, after, a, heart, problem, shortly, after, he, was, suffering, from, inflammation, of, his, gallbladder, the, mounting, pressure, of, his, workload, was, also, taking, a, heavy, toll, and, he, was, suffering, from, a, lot, of, fatigue, korolev, was, also, experiencing, hearing, loss, possibly, from, repeated, exposure, to, loud, rocket, engine, tests, the, actual, circumstances, of, korolev, s, death, remain, somewhat, uncertain, in, december, 1965, he, was, supposedly, diagnosed, with, a, bleeding, polyp, in, his, large, intestine, he, entered, the, hospital, on, 5, january, 1966, for, somewhat, routine, surgery, but, died, nine, days, later, it, was, stated, by, the, government, that, he, had, what, turned, out, to, be, a, large, cancerous, tumor, in, his, abdomen, but, valentin, glushko, later, reported, that, he, actually, died, due, to, a, poorly, performed, operation, for, hemorrhoids, another, version, states, that, the, operation, was, going, well, and, no, one, was, predicting, any, complications, suddenly, during, the, operation, korolev, started, to, bleed, doctors, tried, to, provide, intubation, to, allow, him, to, breathe, freely, but, his, jaws, injured, during, his, time, in, a, gulag, had, not, healed, properly, and, impeded, the, installation, of, the, breathing, tube, korolev, died, without, regaining, consciousness, according, to, harford, korolev, s, family, confirmed, the, cancer, story, his, weak, heart, contributed, to, his, death, during, surgery, under, a, policy, initiated, by, stalin, and, continued, by, his, successors, the, identity, of, korolev, was, not, revealed, until, after, his, death, the, purported, reason, was, to, protect, him, from, foreign, agents, from, the, united, states, as, a, result, the, soviet, people, did, not, become, aware, of, his, accomplishments, until, after, his, death, his, obituary, was, published, in, the, pravda, newspaper, on, 16, january, 1966, showing, a, photograph, of, korolev, with, all, his, medals, korolev, s, ashes, were, interred, with, state, honors, in, the, kremlin, wall, korolev, is, comparable, to, wernher, von, braun, as, the, leading, architects, of, the, space, race, like, von, braun, korolev, had, to, compete, continually, with, rivals, such, as, vladimir, chelomey, who, had, their, own, plans, for, flights, to, the, moon, unlike, the, americans, he, also, had, to, work, with, technology, that, in, many, aspects, was, less, advanced, than, what, was, available, in, the, united, states, particularly, in, electronics, and, computers, and, to, cope, with, extreme, political, pressure, korolev, s, successor, in, the, soviet, space, program, was, vasily, mishin, a, quite, competent, engineer, who, had, served, as, his, deputy, and, right, hand, man, after, korolev, died, mishin, became, the, chief, designer, and, he, inherited, what, turned, out, to, be, a, flawed, n1, rocket, program, in, 1972, mishin, was, fired, and, then, replaced, by, a, rival, valentin, glushko, after, all, four, n, 1, test, launches, failed, by, that, time, the, rival, americans, had, already, made, it, to, the, moon, and, so, the, program, was, canceled, by, cpsu, general, secretary, leonid, brezhnev, the, soviet, migr, leonid, vladimirov, related, the, following, description, of, korolev, by, valentin, glushko, at, about, this, time, short, of, stature, heavily, built, with, head, sitting, awkwardly, on, his, body, with, brown, eyes, glistening, with, intelligence, he, was, a, skeptic, a, cynic, and, a, pessimist, who, took, the, gloomiest, view, of, the, future, we, are, all, going, to, be, shot, and, there, will, be, no, obituary, khlopnut, bez, nekrologa, i, e, we, will, all, vanish, without, a, trace, was, his, favorite, expression, korolev, was, rarely, known, to, drink, alcoholic, beverages, and, chose, to, live, a, fairly, austere, lifestyle, his, career, also, contributed, to, instability, in, his, personal, life, about, 1946, the, marriage, of, korolev, and, vincentini, began, to, break, up, vincentini, was, heavily, occupied, with, her, own, career, and, about, this, time, korolev, had, an, affair, with, a, younger, woman, named, nina, ivanovna, kotenkova, who, was, an, english, interpreter, in, the, podlipki, office, vincentini, who, still, loved, korolev, and, was, angry, over, the, infidelity, divorced, him, in, 1948, korolev, and, kotenkova, were, married, in, 1949, but, he, is, known, to, have, had, affairs, even, after, this, second,
