alfred, tarski, t, r, s, k, i, born, alfred, teitelbaum, january, 14, 1901, october, 26, 1983, was, a, polish, american, logician, and, mathematician, a, prolific, author, best, known, for, his, work, on, model, theory, metamathematics, and, algebraic, logic, he, also, contributed, to, abstract, algebra, topology, geometry, measure, theory, mathematical, logic, set, theory, and, analytic, philosophy, educated, in, poland, at, the, university, of, warsaw, and, a, member, of, the, lw, w, warsaw, school, of, logic, and, the, warsaw, school, of, mathematics, he, immigrated, to, the, united, states, in, 1939, where, he, became, a, naturalized, citizen, in, 1945, tarski, taught, and, carried, out, research, in, mathematics, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, from, 1942, until, his, death, in, 1983, his, biographers, anita, burdman, feferman, and, solomon, feferman, state, that, along, with, his, contemporary, kurt, g, del, he, changed, the, face, of, logic, in, the, twentieth, century, especially, through, his, work, on, the, concept, of, truth, and, the, theory, of, models, alfred, tarski, was, born, alfred, teitelbaum, polish, spelling, tajtelbaum, to, parents, who, were, polish, jews, in, comfortable, circumstances, he, first, manifested, his, mathematical, abilities, while, in, secondary, school, at, warsaw, s, szko, a, mazowiecka, nevertheless, he, entered, the, university, of, warsaw, in, 1918, intending, to, study, biology, after, poland, regained, independence, in, 1918, warsaw, university, came, under, the, leadership, of, jan, ukasiewicz, stanis, aw, le, niewski, and, wac, aw, sierpi, ski, and, quickly, became, a, world, leading, research, institution, in, logic, foundational, mathematics, and, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, le, niewski, recognized, tarski, s, potential, as, a, mathematician, and, encouraged, him, to, abandon, biology, henceforth, tarski, attended, courses, taught, by, ukasiewicz, sierpi, ski, stefan, mazurkiewicz, and, tadeusz, kotarbi, ski, and, in, 1924, became, the, only, person, ever, to, complete, a, doctorate, under, le, niewski, s, supervision, his, thesis, was, entitled, o, wyrazie, pierwotnym, logistyki, on, the, primitive, term, of, logistic, published, 1923, tarski, and, le, niewski, soon, grew, cool, to, each, other, mainly, due, to, the, latter, s, increasing, anti, semitism, however, in, later, life, tarski, reserved, his, warmest, praise, for, kotarbi, ski, which, was, reciprocated, in, 1923, alfred, teitelbaum, and, his, brother, wac, aw, changed, their, surname, to, tarski, the, tarski, brothers, also, converted, to, roman, catholicism, poland, s, dominant, religion, alfred, did, so, even, though, he, was, an, avowed, atheist, after, becoming, the, youngest, person, ever, to, complete, a, doctorate, at, warsaw, university, tarski, taught, logic, at, the, polish, pedagogical, institute, mathematics, and, logic, at, the, university, and, served, as, ukasiewicz, s, assistant, because, these, positions, were, poorly, paid, tarski, also, taught, mathematics, at, the, third, boys, gimnazjum, of, the, trade, union, of, polish, secondary, school, teachers, later, the, stefan, eromski, gimnazjum, a, warsaw, secondary, school, beginning, in, 1925, before, world, war, ii, it, was, not, uncommon, for, european, intellectuals, of, research, caliber, to, teach, high, school, hence, until, his, departure, for, the, united, states, in, 1939, tarski, not, only, wrote, several, textbooks, and, many, papers, a, number, of, them, ground, breaking, but, also, did, so, while, supporting, himself, primarily, by, teaching, high, school, mathematics, in, 1929, tarski, married, fellow, teacher, maria, witkowska, a, pole, of, catholic, background, she, had, worked, as, a, courier, for, the, army, in, the, polish, soviet, war, they, had, two, children, a, son, jan, tarski, who, became, a, physicist, and, a, daughter, ina, who, married, the, mathematician, andrzej, ehrenfeucht, tarski, applied, for, a, chair, of, philosophy, at, lw, w, university, but, on, bertrand, russell, s, recommendation, it, was, awarded, to, leon, chwistek, in, 1930, tarski, visited, the, university, of, vienna, lectured, to, karl, menger, s, colloquium, and, met, kurt, g, del, thanks, to, a, fellowship, he, was, able, to, return, to, vienna, during, the, first, half, of, 1935, to, work, with, menger, s, research, group, from, vienna, he, traveled, to, paris, to, present, his, ideas, on, truth, at, the, first, meeting, of, the, unity, of, science, movement, an, outgrowth, of, the, vienna, circle, tarski, s, academic, career, in, poland, was, strongly, and, repeatedly, impacted, by, his, heritage, for, example, in, 1937, tarski, applied, for, a, chair, at, pozna, university, but, the, chair, was, abolished, to, avoid, assigning, it, to, tarski, who, was, undisputedly, the, strongest, applicant, because, he, was, a, jew, tarski, s, ties, to, the, unity, of, science, movement, likely, saved, his, life, because, they, resulted, in, his, being, invited, to, address, the, unity, of, science, congress, held, in, september, 1939, at, harvard, university, thus, he, left, poland, in, august, 1939, on, the, last, ship, to, sail, from, poland, for, the, united, states, before, the, german, and, soviet, invasion, of, poland, and, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, tarski, left, reluctantly, because, le, niewski, had, died, a, few, months, before, creating, a, vacancy, which, tarski, hoped, to, fill, oblivious, to, the, nazi, threat, he, left, his, wife, and, children, in, warsaw, he, did, not, see, them, again, until, 1946, during, the, war, nearly, all, his, jewish, extended, family, were, murdered, at, the, hands, of, the, german, occupying, authorities, once, in, the, united, states, tarski, held, a, number, of, temporary, teaching, and, research, positions, harvard, university, 1939, city, college, of, new, york, 1940, and, thanks, to, a, guggenheim, fellowship, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, 1942, where, he, again, met, g, del, in, 1942, tarski, joined, the, mathematics, department, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, where, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, career, tarski, became, an, american, citizen, in, 1945, although, emeritus, from, 1968, he, taught, until, 1973, and, supervised, ph, d, candidates, until, his, death, at, berkeley, tarski, acquired, a, reputation, as, an, astounding, and, demanding, teacher, a, fact, noted, by, many, observers, his, seminars, at, berkeley, quickly, became, famous, in, the, world, of, mathematical, logic, his, students, many, of, whom, became, distinguished, mathematicians, noted, the, awesome, energy, with, which, he, would, coax, and, cajole, their, best, work, out, of, them, always, demanding, the, highest, standards, of, clarity, and, precision, tarski, was, extroverted, quick, witted, strong, willed, energetic, and, sharp, tongued, he, preferred, his, research, to, be, collaborative, sometimes, working, all, night, with, a, colleague, and, was, very, fastidious, about, priority, a, charismatic, leader, and, teacher, known, for, his, brilliantly, precise, yet, suspenseful, expository, style, tarski, had, intimidatingly, high, standards, for, students, but, at, the, same, time, he, could, be, very, encouraging, and, particularly, so, to, women, in, contrast, to, the, general, trend, some, students, were, frightened, away, but, a, circle, of, disciples, remained, many, of, whom, became, world, renowned, leaders, in, the, field, tarski, supervised, twenty, four, ph, d, dissertations, including, in, chronological, order, those, of, andrzej, mostowski, bjarni, j, nsson, julia, robinson, robert, vaught, solomon, feferman, richard, montague, james, donald, monk, haim, gaifman, donald, pigozzi, and, roger, maddux, as, well, as, chen, chung, chang, and, jerome, keisler, authors, of, model, theory, 1973, a, classic, text, in, the, field, he, also, strongly, influenced, the, dissertations, of, adolf, lindenbaum, dana, scott, and, steven, givant, five, of, tarski, s, students, were, women, a, remarkable, fact, given, that, men, represented, an, overwhelming, majority, of, graduate, students, at, the, time, however, he, had, extra, marital, affairs, with, at, least, two, of, these, students, after, he, showed, another, of, his, female, student, s, work, to, a, male, colleague, the, colleague, published, it, himself, leading, her, to, leave, the, graduate, study, and, later, move, to, a, different, university, and, a, different, advisor, tarski, lectured, at, university, college, london, 1950, 1966, the, institut, henri, poincar, in, paris, 1955, the, miller, institute, for, basic, research, in, science, in, berkeley, 1958, 60, the, university, of, california, at, los, angeles, 1967, and, the, pontifical, catholic, university, of, chile, 1974, 75, among, many, distinctions, garnered, over, the, course, of, his, career, tarski, was, elected, to, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, the, british, academy, and, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1958, received, honorary, degrees, from, the, pontifical, catholic, university, of, chile, in, 1975, from, marseilles, paul, c, zanne, university, in, 1977, and, from, the, university, of, calgary, as, well, as, the, berkeley, citation, in, 1981, tarski, presided, over, the, association, for, symbolic, logic, 1944, 46, and, the, international, union, for, the, history, and, philosophy, of, science, 1956, 57, he, was, also, an, honorary, editor, of, algebra, universalis, tarski, s, mathematical, interests, were, exceptionally, broad, his, collected, papers, run, to, about, 2, 500, pages, most, of, them, on, mathematics, not, logic, for, a, concise, survey, of, tarski, s, mathematical, and, logical, accomplishments, by, his, former, student, solomon, feferman, see, interludes, i, vi, in, feferman, and, feferman, tarski, s, first, paper, published, when, he, was, 19, years, old, was, on, set, theory, a, subject, to, which, he, returned, throughout, his, life, in, 1924, he, and, stefan, banach, proved, that, if, one, accepts, the, axiom, of, choice, a, ball, can, be, cut, into, a, finite, number, of, pieces, and, then, reassembled, into, a, ball, of, larger, size, or, alternatively, it, can, be, reassembled, into, two, balls, whose, sizes, each, equal, that, of, the, original, one, this, result, is, now, called, the, banach, tarski, paradox, in, a, decision, method, for, elementary, algebra, and, geometry, tarski, showed, by, the, method, of, quantifier, elimination, that, the, first, order, theory, of, the, real, numbers, under, addition, and, multiplication, is, decidable, while, this, result, appeared, only, in, 1948, it, dates, back, to, 1930, and, was, mentioned, in, tarski, 1931, this, is, a, very, curious, result, because, alonzo, church, proved, in, 1936, that, peano, arithmetic, the, theory, of, natural, numbers, is, not, decidable, peano, arithmetic, is, also, incomplete, by, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorem, in, his, 1953, undecidable, theories, tarski, et, al, showed, that, many, mathematical, systems, including, lattice, theory, abstract, projective, geometry, and, closure, algebras, are, all, undecidable, the, theory, of, abelian, groups, is, decidable, but, that, of, non, abelian, groups, is, not, while, teaching, at, the, stefan, eromski, gimnazjum, in, the, 1920s, and, 30s, tarski, often, taught, geometry, using, some, ideas, of, mario, pieri, in, 1926, tarski, devised, an, original, axiomatization, for, plane, euclidean, geometry, one, considerably, more, concise, than, hilbert, s, tarski, s, axioms, form, a, first, order, theory, devoid, of, set, theory, whose, individuals, are, points, and, having, only, two, primitive, relations, in, 1930, he, proved, this, theory, decidable, because, it, can, be, mapped, into, another, theory, he, had, already, proved, decidable, namely, his, first, order, theory, of, the, real, numbers, in, 1929, he, showed, that, much, of, euclidean, solid, geometry, could, be, recast, as, a, second, order, theory, whose, individuals, are, spheres, a, primitive, notion, a, single, primitive, binary, relation, is, contained, in, and, two, axioms, that, among, other, things, imply, that, containment, partially, orders, the, spheres, relaxing, the, requirement, that, all, individuals, be, spheres, yields, a, formalization, of, mereology, far, easier, to, exposit, than, lesniewski, s, variant, near, the, end, of, his, life, tarski, wrote, a, very, long, letter, published, as, tarski, and, givant, 1999, summarizing, his, work, on, geometry, cardinal, algebras, studied, algebras, whose, models, include, the, arithmetic, of, cardinal, numbers, ordinal, algebras, sets, out, an, algebra, for, the, additive, theory, of, order, types, cardinal, but, not, ordinal, addition, commutes, in, 1941, tarski, published, an, important, paper, on, binary, relations, which, began, the, work, on, relation, algebra, and, its, metamathematics, that, occupied, tarski, and, his, students, for, much, of, the, balance, of, his, life, while, that, exploration, and, the, closely, related, work, of, roger, lyndon, uncovered, some, important, limitations, of, relation, algebra, tarski, also, showed, tarski, and, givant, 1987, that, relation, algebra, can, express, most, axiomatic, set, theory, and, peano, arithmetic, for, an, introduction, to, relation, algebra, see, maddux, 2006, in, the, late, 1940s, tarski, and, his, students, devised, cylindric, algebras, which, are, to, first, order, logic, what, the, two, element, boolean, algebra, is, to, classical, sentential, logic, this, work, culminated, in, the, two, monographs, by, tarski, henkin, and, monk, 1971, 1985, tarski, s, student, robert, lawson, vaught, has, ranked, tarski, as, one, of, the, four, greatest, logicians, of, all, time, along, with, aristotle, gottlob, frege, and, kurt, g, del, however, tarski, often, expressed, great, admiration, for, charles, sanders, peirce, particularly, for, his, pioneering, work, in, the, logic, of, relations, tarski, produced, axioms, for, logical, consequence, and, worked, on, deductive, systems, the, algebra, of, logic, and, the, theory, of, definability, his, semantic, methods, which, culminated, in, the, model, theory, he, and, a, number, of, his, berkeley, students, developed, in, the, 1950s, and, 60s, radically, transformed, hilbert, s, proof, theoretic, metamathematics, around, 1930, tarski, developed, an, abstract, theory, of, logical, deductions, that, models, some, properties, of, logical, calculi, mathematically, what, he, described, is, just, a, finitary, closure, operator, on, a, set, the, set, of, sentences, in, abstract, algebraic, logic, finitary, closure, operators, are, still, studied, under, the, name, consequence, operator, which, was, coined, by, tarski, the, set, s, represents, a, set, of, sentences, a, subset, t, of, s, a, theory, and, cl, t, is, the, set, of, all, sentences, that, follow, from, the, theory, this, abstract, approach, was, applied, to, fuzzy, logic, see, gerla, 2000, in, view, metamathematics, became, similar, to, any, mathematical, discipline, not, only, can, its, concepts, and, results, be, mathematized, but, they, actually, can, be, integrated, into, mathematics, tarski, destroyed, the, borderline, between, metamathematics, and, mathematics, he, objected, to, restricting, the, role, of, metamathematics, to, the, foundations, of, mathematics, tarski, s, 1936, article, on, the, concept, of, logical, consequence, argued, that, the, conclusion, of, an, argument, will, follow, logically, from, its, premises, if, and, only, if, every, model, of, the, premises, is, a, model, of, the, conclusion, in, 1937, he, published, a, paper, presenting, clearly, his, views, on, the, nature, and, purpose, of, the, deductive, method, and, the, role, of, logic, in, scientific, studies, his, high, school, and, undergraduate, teaching, on, logic, and, axiomatics, culminated, in, a, classic, short, text, published, first, in, polish, then, in, german, translation, and, finally, in, a, 1941, english, translation, as, introduction, to, logic, and, to, the, methodology, of, deductive, sciences, tarski, s, 1969, truth, and, proof, considered, both, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, and, tarski, s, undefinability, theorem, and, mulled, over, their, consequences, for, the, axiomatic, method, in, mathematics, in, 1933, tarski, published, a, very, long, paper, in, polish, titled, poj, cie, prawdy, w, j, zykach, nauk, dedukcyjnych, setting, out, a, mathematical, definition, of, truth, for, formal, languages, the, 1935, german, translation, was, titled, der, wahrheitsbegriff, in, den, formalisierten, sprachen, the, concept, of, truth, in, formalized, languages, sometimes, shortened, to, wahrheitsbegriff, an, english, translation, appeared, in, the, 1956, first, edition, of, the, volume, logic, semantics, metamathematics, this, collection, of, papers, from, 1923, to, 1938, is, an, event, in, 20th, century, analytic, philosophy, a, contribution, to, symbolic, logic, semantics, and, the, philosophy, of, language, for, a, brief, discussion, of, its, content, see, convention, t, and, also, t, schema, a, philosophical, debate, examines, the, extent, to, which, tarski, s, theory, of, truth, for, formalized, languages, can, be, seen, as, a, correspondence, theory, of, truth, the, debate, centers, on, how, to, read, tarski, s, condition, of, material, adequacy, for, a, true, definition, that, condition, requires, that, the, truth, theory, have, the, following, as, theorems, for, all, sentences, p, of, the, language, for, which, truth, is, being, defined, where, p, is, the, proposition, expressed, by, p, the, debate, amounts, to, whether, to, read, sentences, of, this, form, such, as, snow, is, white, is, true, if, and, only, if, snow, is, white, as, expressing, merely, a, deflationary, theory, of, truth, or, as, embodying, truth, as, a, more, substantial, property, see, kirkham, 1992, in, 1936, tarski, published, polish, and, german, versions, of, a, lecture, on, the, concept, of, following, logically, he, had, given, the, preceding, year, at, the, international, congress, of, scientific, philosophy, in, paris, a, new, english, translation, of, this, paper, tarski, 2002, highlights, the, many, differences, between, the, german, and, polish, versions, of, the, paper, and, corrects, a, number, of, mistranslations, in, tarski, 1983, this, publication, set, out, the, modern, model, theoretic, definition, of, semantic, logical, consequence, or, at, least, the, basis, for, it, whether, tarski, s, notion, was, entirely, the, modern, one, turns, on, whether, he, intended, to, admit, models, with, varying, domains, and, in, particular, models, with, domains, of, different, cardinalities, this, question, is, a, matter, of, some, debate, in, the, philosophical, literature, john, etchemendy, stimulated, much, of, the, discussion, about, tarski, s, treatment, of, varying, domains, tarski, ends, by, pointing, out, that, his, definition, of, logical, consequence, depends, upon, a, division, of, terms, into, the, logical, and, the, extra, logical, and, he, expresses, some, skepticism, that, any, such, objective, division, will, be, forthcoming, what, are, logical, notions, can, thus, be, viewed, as, continuing, on, the, concept, of, logical, consequence, tarski, s, what, are, logical, notions, tarski, 1986, is, the, published, version, of, a, talk, that, he, gave, originally, in, 1966, in, london, and, later, in, 1973, in, buffalo, it, was, edited, without, his, direct, involvement, by, john, corcoran, it, became, the, most, cited, paper, in, the, journal, history, and, philosophy, of, logic, in, the, talk, tarski, proposed, demarcation, of, logical, operations, which, he, calls, notions, from, non, logical, the, suggested, criteria, were, derived, from, the, erlangen, program, of, the, 19th, century, german, mathematician, felix, klein, mautner, in, 1946, and, possibly, an, article, by, the, portuguese, mathematician, jos, sebasti, o, e, silva, anticipated, tarski, in, applying, the, erlangen, program, to, logic, the, erlangen, program, classified, the, various, types, of, geometry, euclidean, geometry, affine, geometry, topology, etc, by, the, type, of, one, one, transformation, of, space, onto, itself, that, left, the, objects, of, that, geometrical, theory, invariant, a, one, to, one, transformation, is, a, functional, map, of, the, space, onto, itself, so, that, every, point, of, the, space, is, associated, with, or, mapped, to, one, other, point, of, the, space, so, rotate, 30, degrees, and, magnify, by, a, factor, of, 2, are, intuitive, descriptions, of, simple, uniform, one, one, transformations, continuous, transformations, give, rise, to, the, objects, of, topology, similarity, transformations, to, those, of, euclidean, geometry, and, so, on, as, the, range, of, permissible, transformations, becomes, broader, the, range, of, objects, one, is, able, to, distinguish, as, preserved, by, the, application, of, the, transformations, becomes, narrower, similarity, transformations, are, fairly, narrow, they, preserve, the, relative, distance, between, points, and, thus, allow, us, to, distinguish, relatively, many, things, e, g, equilateral, triangles, from, non, equilateral, triangles, continuous, transformations, which, can, intuitively, be, thought, of, as, transformations, which, allow, non, uniform, stretching, compression, bending, and, twisting, but, no, ripping, or, glueing, allow, us, to, distinguish, a, polygon, from, an, annulus, ring, with, a, hole, in, the, centre, but, do, not, allow, us, to, distinguish, two, polygons, from, each, other, tarski, s, proposal, was, to, demarcate, the, logical, notions, by, considering, all, possible, one, to, one, transformations, automorphisms, of, a, domain, onto, itself, by, domain, is, meant, the, universe, of, discourse, of, a, model, for, the, semantic, theory, of, logic, if, one, identifies, the, truth, value, true, with, the, domain, set, and, the, truth, value, false, with, the, empty, set, then, the, following, operations, are, counted, as, logical, under, the, proposal, in, some, ways, the, present, proposal, is, the, obverse, of, that, of, lindenbaum, and, tarski, 1936, who, proved, that, all, the, logical, operations, of, bertrand, russell, s, and, whitehead, s, principia, mathematica, are, invariant, under, one, to, one, transformations, of, the, domain, onto, itself, the, present, proposal, is, also, employed, in, tarski, and, givant, 1987, solomon, feferman, and, vann, mcgee, further, discussed, tarski, s, proposal, in, work, published, after, his, death, feferman, 1999, raises, problems, for, the, proposal, and, suggests, a, cure, replacing, tarski, s, preservation, by, automorphisms, with, preservation, by, arbitrary, homomorphisms, in, essence, this, suggestion, circumvents, the, difficulty, tarski, s, proposal, has, in, dealing, with, a, sameness, of, logical, operation, across, distinct, domains, of, a, given, cardinality, and, across, domains, of, distinct, cardinalities, feferman, s, proposal, results, in, a, radical, restriction, of, logical, terms, as, compared, to, tarski, s, original, proposal, in, particular, it, ends, up, counting, as, logical, only, those, operators, of, standard, first, order, logic, without, identity, vann, mcgee, 1996, provides, a, precise, account, of, what, operations, are, logical, in, the, sense, of, tarski, s, proposal, in, terms, of, expressibility, in, a, language, that, extends, first, order, logic, by, allowing, arbitrarily, long, conjunctions, and, disjunctions, and, quantification, over, arbitrarily, many, variables, arbitrarily, includes, a, countable, infinity
