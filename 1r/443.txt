the, book, pamuk, s, books, are, characterized, by, a, confusion, or, loss, of, identity, brought, on, in, part, by, the, conflict, between, western, and, eastern, values, they, are, often,

when, he, discusses, his, creativity, i, am, just, listening, to, an, inner, music, the, mystery, of, which, i, don, t, completely, know, and, i, don, t, want, to, know, i, am, most, surprised, by, those, moments, when, i, have, felt, as, if, the, sentences, dreams, and, pages, that, have, made, me, so, ecstatically, happy, have, not, come, from, my, own, imagination, that, another, power, has, found, them, and, generously, presented, them, to, me, a, group, of, writers, assert, that, some, parts, of, pamuk, s, works, are, heavily, influenced, by, the, works, of, other, writers, and, some,
