for, about, a, year, he, spent, his, first, years, importing, and, selling, books, from, the, uk, and, became, familiar, with, early, photography, through, his, acquaintance, with, new, york, daguerreotypist, silas, t, selleck, muybridge, arrived, in, new, orleans, in, january, 1855, and, was, registered, there, as, a, book, agent, by, april, muybridge, probably, arrived, in, california, around, the, autumn, of, 1855, when, it, had, not, yet, been, a, state, for, more, than, five, years, he, visited, the, new, state, capital, sacramento, as, an, agent, selling, illustrated,

still, the, booming, capital, of, the, gold, rush, in, the, wild, west, there, were, already, 40, bookstores, and, a, dozen, photography, studios, in, town, and, he, even, shared, his, address, with, a, photo, gallery, right, next, to, another, bookstore, he, partnered, with, w, h, oakes, as, an, engraver, and, publisher, of, lithograph, prints, and, still, functioned, as, a, book, agent, for, the, london, printing, and, publishing, company, in, april, 1858, muybridge, moved, his, store, to, 163, clay, street, where, his, friend, silas, selleck, now, had, a, photo, gallery, muygridge, was, a, member, of, the, mechanic, s, institute, of, the, city, of, san, francisco, in, 1859, he, was, elected, as, one, of, the, directors, for, the, san, francisco, mercantile, library, association, muybridge, sold, original, landscape, photography, by, carleton, watkins, as, well, as, photographic, copies, of, paintings, it, remains, uncertain, whether, or, not, muygridge, personally, made, such, copies, or, familiarized, himself, with, photographic, techniques, in, any, fashion, before, 1860, although, muybridge, claimed, in, 1881, that, he, came, to, california, in, 1855, and, most, of, the, time, since, and, all, of, the, time, since, 1860, had, been, diligently, and, at, the, same, time, studiously, been, engaged, in, photography, edward, s, brother, george, muybridge, came, to, san, francisco, in, 1858, but, died, of, tuberculosis, soon, after, their, youngest, brother, thomas, s, muygridge, arrived, in, 1859, and, it, soon, became, clear, that, edward, planned, to, stop, operating, his, bookstore, business, on, 15, may, 1860, edward, published, a, special, announcement, in, the, bulletin, newspaper, i, have, this, day, sold, to, my, brother, thomas, s, muygridge, my, entire, stock, of, books, engravings, etc, i, shall, on, 5th, june, leave, for, new, york, london, berlin, paris, rome, and, vienna, etc, although, he, altered, his, plans, he, eventually, took, a, cross, country, stagecoach, on, 2, july, to, catch, a, ship, in, new, york, in, july, 1860, muybridge, suffered, a, head, injury, in, a, violent, runaway, stagecoach, crash, at, the, texas, border, which, killed, the, driver, and, one, passenger, and, badly, injured, all, other, passengers, muybridge, was, ejected, from, the, vehicle, and, hit, his, head, on, a, rock, or, another, hard, object, 1, 2, he, woke, up, in, a, hospital, bed, at, fort, smith, arkansas, with, no, recollection, of, the, nine, days, after, he, had, taken, supper, at, a, wayside, cabin, 150, miles, 240, km, away, not, long, before, the, accident, he, suffered, from, a, bad, headache, double, vision, deafness, loss, of, taste, and, smell, and, confusion, it, was, later, claimed, that, his, hair, turned, from, black, to, grey, in, three, days, the, problems, persisted, fully, for, three, months, and, to, a, lesser, extent, for, a, year, arthur, p, shimamura, an, experimental, psychologist, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, has, speculated, that, muybridge, suffered, substantial, injuries, to, the, orbitofrontal, cortex, that, probably, also, extended, into, the, anterior, temporal, lobes, which, may, have, led, to, some, of, the, emotional, eccentric, behaviour, reported, by, friends, in, later, years, as, well, as, freeing, his, creativity, from, conventional, social, inhibitions, today, there, is, still, little, effective, treatment, for, this, kind, of, injury, 2, muybridge, was, treated, at, fort, smith, for, three, weeks, before, he, went, to, a, doctor, in, new, york, city, he, fled, the, noise, of, the, city, and, stayed, in, the, countryside, he, then, went, back, to, new, york, for, six, weeks, and, sued, the, stage, company, which, earned, him, a, 2, 500, compensation, eventually, he, felt, well, enough, to, travel, to, england, where, he, received, medical, care, from, sir, william, gull, who, was, also, personal, physician, to, queen, victoria, and, was, prescribed, abstinence, of, meat, alcohol, and, coffee, for, over, a, year, gull, also, recommended, rest, and, outdoor, activities, and, considering, a, change, in, profession, 3, muybridge, stayed, with, his, mother, in, kennington, and, later, with, his, aunt, while, in, england, muybridge, later, stated, that, he, had, become, a, photographer, at, the, suggestion, of, gull, 3, however, while, outdoors, photography, might, have, helped, in, getting, some, fresh, air, dragging, around, heavy, equipment, and, working, with, chemicals, in, a, dark, room, did, not, comply, with, the, prescriptions, for, rest, that, gull, preferred, to, offer, on, 28, september, 1860, e, muggeridge, of, new, york, applied, for, british, patent, no, 2352, for, an, improved, method, of, and, apparatus, for, plate, printing, via, london, solicitor, august, frederick, sheppard, on, 1, august, 1861, muygridge, received, british, patent, no, 1914, for, improvements, in, machinery, or, apparatus, for, washing, clothes, and, other, textile, articles, on, 28, october, the, french, version, of, this, patent, was, registered, he, wrote, a, letter, to, his, uncle, henry, who, had, immigrated, to, sydney, australia, with, details, of, the, patents, and, he, also, mentioned, having, to, visit, europe, for, business, for, several, months, muygridge, s, inventions, or, rather, improved, machinery, were, demonstrated, at, the, 1862, international, exhibition, muybridge, s, activities, and, whereabouts, between, 1862, and, 1865, are, not, very, well, documented, he, turned, up, in, paris, in, 1862, and, again, in, 1864, in, 1865, he, was, one, of, the, directors, for, the, austin, consolidated, silver, mines, company, limited, and, for, the, ottoman, company, limited, the, bank, of, turkey, limited, under, his, new, name, muybridge, both, enterprises, were, very, short, lived, due, to, the, panic, of, 1866, and, muybridge, chaired, the, meetings, in, which, the, companies, were, dissolved, during, the, spring, of, 1866, muybridge, may, have, taken, up, photography, sometime, between, 1861, and, 1866, he, possibly, learned, the, wet, plate, collodion, process, in, england, and, was, possibly, influenced, by, some, of, well, known, english, photographers, of, those, years, such, as, julia, margaret, cameron, lewis, carroll, and, roger, fenton, however, it, remains, unclear, how, much, he, had, already, learned, before, the, accident, and, how, much, he, may, have, learned, after, his, return, to, the, united, states, muybridge, returned, to, san, francisco, on, 13, february, 1867, a, changed, man, friends, and, associates, later, stated, that, he, had, changed, from, a, smart, and, pleasant, businessman, into, an, eccentric, artist, 3, he, was, much, more, careless, about, his, appearance, was, easily, agitated, could, suddenly, take, objection, to, people, and, soon, after, act, like, nothing, had, happened, and, he, would, regularly, misstate, previously, arranged, business, deals, 3, his, care, about, whether, he, judged, something, to, be, beautiful, had, become, much, stronger, than, his, care, for, money, he, easily, refused, payment, if, a, customer, seemed, to, be, slightly, critical, of, his, work, photographer, silas, selleck, who, had, known, muybridge, from, new, york, since, circa, 1852, and, had, been, a, close, friend, since, 1855, claimed, that, he, could, hardly, recognize, muybridge, after, his, return, muybridge, converted, a, lightweight, two, wheel, one, horse, carriage, into, a, portable, darkroom, to, carry, out, his, work, and, with, a, logo, on, the, back, dubbed, it, helios, flying, studio, he, had, acquired, highly, proficient, technical, skills, and, an, artist, s, eye, and, became, very, successful, in, photography, focusing, principally, on, landscape, and, architectural, subjects, an, 1868, advertisement, stated, a, wide, scope, of, subjects, helios, is, prepared, to, accept, commissions, to, photograph, private, residences, ranches, mills, views, animals, ships, etc, anywhere, in, the, city, or, any, portion, of, the, pacific, coast, architects, surveyors, and, engineers, drawings, copied, mathamatically, sic, correct, photographic, copies, of, paintings, and, works, of, art, muybridge, constantly, tinkered, with, his, cameras, and, chemicals, trying, to, improve, the, sales, appeal, of, his, pictures, in, 1869, he, patented, a, sky, shade, to, reduce, the, tendency, of, intense, blue, outdoors, skies, to, bleach, out, the, images, of, the, blue, sensitive, photographic, emulsions, of, the, time, an, article, published, in, 2017, and, an, expanded, book, document, that, muybridge, heavily, edited, and, modified, his, photos, inserting, clouds, or, the, moon, even, adding, volcanos, to, his, pictures, for, artistic, effects, helios, produced, over, 400, different, stereograph, cards, initially, sold, through, seleck, s, cosmopolitan, gallery, at, 415, montgomery, street, and, later, through, other, distributors, such, as, bradley, rulofson, many, of, these, cards, showed, views, of, san, francisco, and, its, surroundings, stereo, cards, were, extremely, popular, at, the, time, and, thus, could, be, sold, in, large, quantities, for, a, very, low, price, to, tourists, as, a, souvenir, or, to, proud, citizens, and, collectors, early, in, his, new, career, muybridge, was, hired, by, robert, b, woodward, 1824, 1879, to, take, extensive, photos, of, his, woodward, s, gardens, a, combination, amusement, park, zoo, museum, and, aquarium, that, had, opened, in, san, francisco, in, 1866, muybridge, took, pictures, of, ruins, after, the, 21, october, 1868, hayward, earthquake, during, the, construction, of, the, san, francisco, mint, in, 1870, 1872, muybridge, made, a, series, of, images, of, the, building, s, progress, documenting, changes, over, time, in, a, fashion, similar, to, time, lapse, photography, these, images, may, have, attracted, the, attention, of, leland, stanford, who, would, later, hire, muybridge, to, develop, an, unprecedented, series, of, photos, spaced, in, time, from, june, to, november, 1867, muybridge, visited, yosemite, valley, he, took, enormous, safety, risks, to, make, his, photographs, using, a, heavy, view, camera, and, stacks, of, glass, plate, negatives, a, stereograph, he, published, in, 1872, shows, him, sitting, casually, on, a, projecting, rock, over, the, yosemite, valley, with, 2, 000, feet, 610, m, of, empty, space, below, him, 3, he, returned, with, numerous, stereoscopic, views, and, larger, plates, he, selected, 20, pictures, to, be, retouched, and, manipulated, for, a, subscription, series, that, he, announced, in, february, 1868, twenty, original, photographs, possibly, the, same, were, used, to, illustrate, john, s, hittel, s, guide, book, yosemite, its, wonders, and, its, beauties, 1868, some, of, the, pictures, were, taken, of, the, same, scenes, shot, by, his, contemporary, carleton, watkins, muybridge, s, photographs, showed, the, grandeur, and, expansiveness, of, the, west, if, human, figures, were, portrayed, they, were, dwarfed, by, their, surroundings, as, in, chinese, landscape, paintings, in, comparing, the, styles, of, the, two, photographers, watkins, has, been, called, a, classicist, making, serene, stately, pictures, of, a, still, eternal, world, of, beauty, while, muybridge, was, a, romantic, who, sought, out, the, uncanny, the, unsettling, the, uncertain, in, the, 21st, century, there, have, been, claims, that, many, landscape, photos, attributed, to, muybridge, were, actually, made, by, or, under, the, close, guidance, of, watkins, but, these, claims, are, disputed, regardless, muybridge, started, to, develop, his, own, leading, edge, innovations, in, photography, especially, in, the, capturing, of, ever, faster, motion, in, 1868, muybridge, was, commissioned, by, the, us, government, to, travel, to, the, newly, acquired, us, territory, of, alaska, to, photograph, the, tlingit, native, americans, occasional, russian, inhabitants, and, dramatic, landscapes, 242, in, 1871, the, united, states, lighthouse, board, hired, muybridge, to, photograph, lighthouses, of, the, american, west, coast, from, march, to, july, he, travelled, aboard, the, lighthouse, tender, shubrick, to, document, these, structures, in, 1873, muybridge, was, commissioned, by, the, us, army, to, photograph, the, modoc, war, dispute, with, the, native, american, tribe, in, northern, california, and, oregon, 46, a, number, of, these, photographs, were, carefully, staged, and, posed, for, maximum, effect, despite, the, long, exposures, required, by, the, slow, photographic, emulsions, of, the, time, in, 1872, the, former, governor, of, california, leland, stanford, a, businessman, and, race, horse, owner, hired, muybridge, for, a, portfolio, depicting, his, mansion, and, other, possessions, including, his, racehorse, occident, stanford, also, wanted, a, proper, picture, of, the, horse, at, full, speed, and, was, frustrated, that, the, existing, depictions, and, descriptions, seemed, incorrect, the, human, eye, could, not, fully, break, down, the, action, at, the, quick, gaits, of, the, trot, and, gallop, up, until, this, time, most, artists, painted, horses, at, a, trot, with, one, foot, always, on, the, ground, and, at, a, full, gallop, with, the, front, legs, extended, forward, and, the, hind, legs, extended, to, the, rear, and, all, feet, off, the, ground, there, are, stories, that, stanford, had, made, a, 25, 000, bet, on, his, theories, about, horse, locomotion, but, no, evidence, has, been, found, of, such, a, wager, however, it, has, been, estimated, that, stanford, spent, a, total, of, 50, 000, over, the, next, several, years, to, fund, his, investigations, in, 1873, muybridge, managed, to, use, a, single, camera, to, shoot, a, small, and, very, fuzzy, picture, of, the, racehorse, occident, running, at, union, park, racetrack, in, sacramento, because, of, the, insensitivity, of, the, photographic, emulsions, used, early, pictures, were, little, more, than, blurry, silhouettes, they, both, agreed, that, the, image, lacked, quality, but, stanford, was, excited, to, finally, have, a, reliable, depiction, of, a, running, horse, no, copy, of, this, earliest, image, has, yet, resurfaced, muybridge, promised, to, study, better, solutions, but, his, work, on, higher, speed, photography, would, take, several, years, to, develop, and, was, also, delayed, by, events, in, his, personal, life, with, the, aid, of, engineers, and, technicians, from, the, central, pacific, railroad, stanford, was, one, of, the, founding, directors, muybridge, experimented, with, ever, faster, mechanical, shutters, and, began, developing, state, of, the, art, electrically, triggered, mechanisms, he, also, experimented, with, more, sensitive, photographic, emulsions, to, work, with, the, shorter, exposure, times, in, july, 1877, muybridge, made, a, new, picture, of, occident, at, full, speed, with, improved, techniques, and, a, much, clearer, result, to, enhance, the, still, fuzzy, picture, he, had, it, recreated, by, a, retouch, artist, and, published, as, a, cabinet, card, the, news, about, this, breakthrough, in, instantaneous, photography, was, spread, enthusiastically, but, several, critics, believed, that, the, heavily, manipulated, image, could, not, be, a, truthful, depiction, of, the, horse, muybridge, allowed, reporters, to, study, the, original, negative, but, as, he, and, stanford, were, planning, a, new, project, that, would, convince, everyone, they, saw, no, need, to, prove, that, this, image, was, authentic, the, original, negative, has, not, yet, resurfaced, in, june, 1878, muybridge, created, sequential, series, of, photographs, now, with, a, battery, of, 12, cameras, along, the, race, track, at, stanford, s, palo, alto, stock, farm, now, the, campus, of, stanford, university, the, shutters, were, automatically, triggered, when, the, wheel, of, a, cart, or, the, breast, or, legs, of, a, horse, tripped, wires, connected, to, an, electromagnetic, circuit, for, a, session, on, 15, june, 1878, the, press, and, a, selection, of, turf, men, were, invited, to, witness, the, process, an, accident, with, a, snapping, strap, was, captured, on, the, negatives, and, shown, to, the, attendees, convincing, even, the, most, sceptical, witnesses, the, news, of, this, success, was, reported, worldwide, the, daily, alta, california, reported, that, muybridge, first, exhibited, magic, lantern, projected, slides, of, the, photographs, at, the, san, francisco, art, association, on, 8, july, 1878, newspapers, were, not, yet, able, to, reproduce, detailed, photographs, so, the, images, were, widely, printed, as, woodcut, engravings, scientific, american, was, among, the, publications, at, the, time, that, carried, reports, and, engravings, of, muybridge, s, groundbreaking, images, six, different, series, were, soon, published, as, cabinet, cards, entitled, the, horse, in, motion, many, people, were, amazed, at, the, previously, unseen, positions, of, the, horse, s, legs, in, action, particularly, the, fact, that, a, running, horse, had, all, four, hooves, in, the, air, at, regular, intervals, this, did, not, take, place, when, the, horse, s, legs, were, extended, to, the, front, and, back, as, imagined, by, illustrators, of, the, time, but, when, its, legs, were, collected, beneath, its, body, as, it, switched, from, pulling, with, the, front, legs, to, pushing, with, the, back, legs, in, 1879, muybridge, continued, with, additional, studies, using, 24, cameras, and, published, a, very, limited, edition, portfolio, of, the, results, muybridge, had, images, from, his, motion, studies, hand, copied, in, the, form, of, silhouettes, or, line, drawings, onto, a, disc, to, be, viewed, in, the, machine, he, had, invented, which, he, called, a, zoopraxiscope, later, his, more, detailed, images, were, hand, coloured, and, marketed, commercially, a, device, he, developed, was, later, regarded, as, an, early, movie, projector, and, the, process, was, an, intermediate, stage, toward, motion, pictures, or, cinematography, in, 1878, muybridge, made, a, notable, 13, part, 360, photographic, panorama, of, san, francisco, he, presented, a, copy, to, the, wife, of, leland, stanford, today, it, can, be, viewed, on, the, internet, as, a, seamlessly, spliced, panorama, or, as, a, quicktime, virtual, reality, qtvr, panorama, that, same, year, he, applied, for, a, patent, on, a, camera, sequence, shutter, to, photograph, moving, objects, with, a, mechanical, trigger, later, that, year, he, applied, for, a, further, patent, this, time, using, an, electrical, trigger, he, also, filed, for, british, and, french, patents, on, 20, may, 1871, 41, year, old, muybridge, married, 21, year, old, divorcee, flora, shallcross, stone, n, e, downs, the, differences, in, their, tastes, and, temperaments, were, understood, to, have, been, due, to, their, age, difference, muybridge, did, not, care, for, many, of, the, amusements, that, she, sought, so, she, went, to, the, theatre, and, other, attractions, without, him, and, he, seemed, to, be, fine, with, that, muybridge, was, more, of, the, type, that, would, stay, up, all, night, to, read, classics, muybridge, was, also, used, to, leaving, home, by, himself, for, days, weeks, or, even, months, visiting, faraway, places, for, personal, projects, or, assignments, this, did, not, change, after, his, marriage, on, 14, april, 1874, flora, gave, birth, to, a, son, florado, helios, muybridge, at, some, stage, flora, became, romantically, involved, with, one, of, their, friends, harry, larkyns, muybridge, intervened, several, times, and, believed, the, affair, was, over, when, he, sent, flora, to, stay, with, a, relative, and, larkyns, found, a, job, at, a, mine, near, calistoga, california, in, mid, october, 1874, muybridge, learned, how, serious, the, relationship, between, his, wife, and, larkyns, really, was, flora, s, maternity, nurse, revealed, many, details, and, she, had, in, her, possession, some, love, letters, that, the, couple, had, still, been, writing, to, each, other, at, her, place, muybridge, also, came, across, a, picture, of, florado, with, harry, written, on, the, back, in, flora, s, handwriting, suggesting, that, she, believed, the, child, to, be, fathered, by, larkyns, on, 17, october, muybridge, went, to, calistoga, to, track, down, larkyns, upon, finding, him, muybridge, said, i, have, a, message, for, you, from, my, wife, and, shot, him, point, blank, larkyns, died, that, night, and, muybridge, was, arrested, without, protest, and, put, in, the, napa, jail, a, sacramento, daily, union, reporter, visited, muybridge, in, jail, for, an, hour, and, related, how, he, was, coping, with, the, situation, muybridge, was, in, moderately, good, spirits, and, very, hopeful, he, felt, he, was, treated, very, kindly, by, the, officers, and, was, a, little, proud, of, the, influence, he, had, on, other, inmates, which, had, earned, him, everyone, s, respect, he, had, protested, the, abuse, of, a, chinaman, from, a, tough, inmate, by, claiming, no, man, of, any, country, whose, misfortunes, shall, bring, him, here, shall, be, abused, in, my, presence, and, had, strongly, but, politely, voiced, threats, against, the, offender, he, had, addressed, an, outburst, of, profanity, in, a, similar, fashion, flora, filed, for, divorce, on, 17, december, 1874, on, the, grounds, of, extreme, cruelty, but, this, first, petition, was, dismissed, it, was, reported, that, she, fully, sympathized, with, the, prosecution, of, her, husband, muybridge, was, tried, for, murder, in, february, 1875, his, attorney, w, w, pendegast, a, friend, of, stanford, pleaded, insanity, in, his, behalf, due, to, a, severe, head, injury, suffered, in, the, 1860, stagecoach, accident, at, least, four, long, time, acquaintances, testified, under, oath, that, the, accident, had, dramatically, changed, muybridge, s, personality, from, genial, and, pleasant, to, unstable, and, erratic, during, the, trial, muybridge, undercut, his, own, insanity, case, by, indicating, that, his, actions, were, deliberate, and, premeditated, but, he, also, showed, impassive, indifference, and, uncontrolled, explosions, of, emotion, in, the, end, he, was, acquitted, on, the, grounds, of, justifiable, homicide, with, the, jury, explanation, that, if, their, verdict, was, not, in, accordance, with, the, law, it, was, in, accordance, with, the, law, of, human, nature, in, other, words, they, believed, they, could, not, punish, a, person, for, doing, something, that, they, themselves, would, do, in, similar, circumstances, the, episode, interrupted, his, photography, studies, but, not, his, relationship, with, stanford, who, had, arranged, for, his, criminal, defence, by, 1877, muybridge, had, resumed, his, photographic, work, for, stanford, shortly, after, his, acquittal, in, february, 1875, muybridge, left, the, united, states, on, a, previously, planned, 9, month, photography, trip, to, central, america, now, acting, as, a, working, exile, his, photographs, from, this, period, are, less, known, because, relatively, few, copies, were, produced, it, is, believed, that, during, this, period, he, further, developed, his, ability, to, take, pictures, more, rapidly, due, to, the, requirement, that, these, processes, be, performed, aboard, a, constantly, rolling, ship, flora, s, second, petition, for, divorce, received, a, favourable, ruling, and, an, order, for, alimony, was, entered, in, april, 1875, flora, died, suddenly, in, july, 1875, while, muybridge, was, in, central, america, she, had, placed, their, son, florado, helios, muybridge, later, nicknamed, floddie, by, friends, with, a, french, couple, in, 1876, muybridge, had, the, boy, moved, from, a, catholic, orphanage, to, a, protestant, one, and, paid, for, his, care, otherwise, he, had, little, to, do, with, him, photographs, of, florado, muybridge, as, an, adult, show, him, to, have, strongly, resembled, muybridge, put, to, work, on, a, ranch, as, a, boy, he, worked, all, his, life, as, a, ranch, hand, and, gardener, in, 1944, florado, was, hit, by, a, car, in, sacramento, and, killed, today, the, court, case, and, transcripts, are, important, to, historians, and, forensic, neurologists, because, of, the, sworn, testimony, from, multiple, witnesses, regarding, muybridge, s, state, of, mind, and, past, behaviour, in, 1982, american, composer, philip, glass, would, create, an, opera, the, photographer, with, a, libretto, based, in, part, on, court, transcripts, from, the, case, muybridge, often, travelled, to, american, cities, as, well, as, back, to, england, and, europe, to, publicise, his, work, the, opening, of, the, transcontinental, railroad, in, 1869, and, the, development, of, steamships, made, travel, much, faster, and, less, arduous, than, it, was, in, 1860, on, 13, march, 1882, he, lectured, at, the, royal, institution, in, london, in, front, of, a, sell, out, audience, which, included, members, of, the, royal, family, notably, the, future, king, edward, vii, he, displayed, his, photographs, on, screen, and, showed, moving, pictures, projected, by, his, zoopraxiscope, he, also, lectured, at, the, royal, academy, of, arts, and, the, royal, society, muybridge, and, stanford, had, a, major, falling, out, concerning, his, research, on, equine, locomotion, stanford, had, asked, his, friend, and, horseman, dr, jbd, stillman, to, write, a, book, analysing, the, horse, in, motion, which, was, published, in, 1882, stillman, used, muybridge, s, photos, as, the, basis, for, his, 100, illustrations, and, the, photographer, s, research, for, the, analysis, but, he, gave, muybridge, no, prominent, credit, the, historian, phillip, prodger, later, suggested, that, stanford, considered, muybridge, as, just, one, of, his, employees, and, not, deserving, of, special, recognition, stanford, was, quite, proud, of, his, role, in, creating, the, book, and, commissioned, a, portrait, of, himself, by, jean, louis, ernest, meissonier, in, which, a, copy, of, the, volume, was, visible, under, his, arm, however, as, a, result, of, muybridge, not, being, credited, in, the, book, the, royal, society, of, arts, withdrew, an, offer, to, fund, his, stop, motion, studies, in, photography, and, refused, to, publish, a, paper, he, had, submitted, accusing, him, of, plagiarism, muybridge, filed, a, lawsuit, against, stanford, to, gain, credit, but, it, was, delayed, two, years, and, then, dismissed, out, of, court, stillman, s, book, did, not, sell, as, expected, muybridge, looking, elsewhere, for, funding, was, more, successful, the, royal, society, of, arts, eventually, invited, muybridge, back, to, show, his, work, in, 1883, muybridge, gave, a, lecture, at, the, pennsylvania, academy, of, the, fine, arts, pafa, arranged, by, artist, thomas, eakins, and, university, of, pennsylvania, trustee, fairman, rogers, at, that, time, eakins, was, a, faculty, member, at, pafa, and, had, recently, been, appointed, its, director, a, group, of, philadelphians, including, penn, provost, william, pepper, and, the, publisher, j, b, lippincott, recruited, him, to, work, at, penn, under, their, sponsorship, between, 1883, and, 1886, muybridge, made, more, than, 100, 000, images, working, obsessively, in, a, dedicated, studio, at, the, northeast, corner, of, 36th, and, pine, streets, in, philadelphia, he, was, now, able, to, afford, multiple, larger, high, quality, lenses, giving, him, the, ability, to, make, simultaneous, pictures, from, multiple, viewpoints, with, a, clarity, and, tonal, range, not, achieved, earlier, in, 1884, eakins, briefly, worked, alongside, muybridge, to, learn, more, about, the, application, of, photography, to, the, study, of, human, and, animal, motion, eakins, later, favoured, the, use, of, multiple, exposures, superimposed, on, a, single, photographic, negative, to, study, motion, more, precisely, while, muybridge, continued, to, use, multiple, cameras, to, produce, separate, images, which, could, also, be, projected, by, his, zoopraxiscope, the, vast, majority, of, muybridge, s, work, at, this, time, was, done, at, a, special, sunlit, outdoor, studio, due, to, the, still, bulky, cameras, and, relatively, slow, photographic, emulsion, speeds, then, available, most, of, the, photographs, were, taken, during, the, summers, and, winters, were, spent, developing, and, organizing, the, images, he, used, banks, of, 12, custom, made, cameras, to, photograph, professors, athletes, students, disabled, patients, from, the, blockley, almshouse, located, next, to, penn, at, the, time, and, local, residents, all, in, motion, he, photographed, at, least, 9, sequences, showing, the, movements, of, neurological, patients, 5, 7, he, also, borrowed, animals, from, the, philadelphia, zoo, to, study, their, movements, in, detail, the, human, models, usually, either, entirely, nude, or, very, lightly, clothed, were, photographed, against, a, measured, grid, background, in, a, variety, of, action, sequences, including, walking, up, or, down, stairs, hammering, on, an, anvil, carrying, buckets, of, water, or, throwing, water, over, one, another, muybridge, produced, sequences, showing, farm, industrial, construction, and, household, work, military, manoeuvres, and, everyday, activities, he, also, photographed, athletic, activities, such, as, baseball, cricket, boxing, wrestling, discus, throwing, and, a, ballet, dancer, performing, showing, a, single, minded, dedication, to, scientific, accuracy, and, artistic, composition, muybridge, himself, posed, nude, for, some, of, the, photographic, sequences, such, as, one, showing, him, swinging, a, miner, s, pick, toward, the, end, of, this, period, muybridge, spent, much, of, his, time, selecting, and, editing, his, photos, in, preparation, for, publication, in, 1887, the, photos, were, published, as, a, massive, collotype, portfolio, in, 11, volumes, with, 781, plates, comprising, 20, 000, of, the, photographs, in, a, groundbreaking, collection, titled, animal, locomotion, an, electro, photographic, investigation, of, consecutive, phases, of, animal, movements, 4, muybridge, s, work, contributed, substantially, to, developments, in, the, science, of, biomechanics, and, the, mechanics, of, athletics, some, of, his, books, are, still, published, today, and, are, used, as, references, by, artists, animators, and, students, of, animal, and, human, movement, in, 1888, the, university, of, pennsylvania, donated, an, album, of, muybridge, s, photographs, which, featured, students, and, philadelphia, zoo, animals, to, the, sultan, of, the, ottoman, empire, abdul, hamid, ii, who, had, a, keen, interest, in, photography, this, gift, may, have, helped, to, secure, permissions, for, the, excavations, that, scholars, from, the, university, of, pennsylvania, museum, of, archaeology, and, anthropology, later, pursued, in, the, ottoman, region, of, mesopotamia, now, iraq, notably, at, the, site, of, nippur, the, ottoman, sultan, reciprocated, five, years, later, by, sending, as, a, gift, to, the, united, states, a, collection, of, photograph, albums, featuring, ottoman, scenes, the, library, of, congress, now, preserves, these, albums, as, the, abdul, hamid, ii, collection, recent, scholarship, has, noted, that, in, his, later, work, muybridge, was, influenced, by, and, in, turn, influenced, the, french, photographer, tienne, jules, marey, in, 1881, muybridge, first, visited, marey, s, studio, in, france, and, viewed, stop, motion, studies, before, returning, to, the, us, to, further, his, own, work, in, the, same, area, marey, was, a, pioneer, in, producing, multiple, exposure, sequential, images, using, a, rotary, shutter, in, his, so, called, marey, wheel, camera, while, marey, s, scientific, achievements, in, the, realms, of, cardiology, and, aerodynamics, as, well, as, pioneering, work, in, photography, and, chronophotography, are, indisputable, muybridge, s, efforts, were, to, some, degree, more, artistic, rather, than, scientific, as, muybridge, explained, in, some, of, his, published, sequences, he, had, substituted, images, where, original, exposures, had, failed, in, order, to, illustrate, a, representative, movement, rather, than, producing, a, strictly, scientific, recording, of, a, particular, sequence, today, similar, setups, of, carefully, timed, multiple, cameras, are, used, in, modern, special, effects, photography, but, they, have, the, opposite, goal, of, capturing, changing, camera, angles, with, little, or, no, movement, of, the, subject, this, is, often, dubbed, bullet, time, photography, after, his, work, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, muybridge, travelled, widely, and, gave, numerous, lectures, and, demonstrations, of, his, still, photography, and, primitive, motion, picture, sequences, at, the, chicago, world, s, columbian, exposition, of, 1893, muybridge, presented, a, series, of, lectures, on, the, science, of, animal, locomotion, in, the, zoopraxographical, hall, built, specially, for, that, purpose, in, the, midway, plaisance, arm, of, the, exposition, he, used, his, zoopraxiscope, to, show, his, moving, pictures, to, a, paying, public, the, hall, was, the, first, commercial, movie, theatre, 4, he, also, sold, a, series, of, souvenir, phenakistoscope, discs, to, demonstrate, simple, animations, using, painted, colour, images, derived, from, his, photographs, eadweard, muybridge, returned, to, his, native, england, in, 1894, and, continued, to, lecture, extensively, throughout, great, britain, he, returned, to, the, us, once, more, in, 1896, 1897, to, settle, financial, affairs, and, to, dispose, of, property, related, to, his, work, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, he, retained, control, of, his, negatives, which, he, used, to, publish, two, popular, books, of, his, work, animals, in, motion, 1899, and, the, human, figure, in, motion, 1901, both, of, which, remain, in, print, over, a, century, later, muybridge, died, on, 8, may, 1904, in, kingston, upon, thames, of, prostate, cancer, at, the, home, of, his, cousin, catherine, smith, it, is, claimed, that, at, that, time, he, was, excavating, a, scale, model, of, the, american, great, lakes, in, the, back, garden, his, body, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, interred, in, a, grave, at, woking, in, surrey, on, the, gravestone, his, name, is, misspelled, as, eadweard, maybridge, in, 2004, a, british, film, institute, commemorative, plaque, was, installed, on, the, outside, wall, of, the, former, smith, house, at, park, view, 2, liverpool, road, many, of, his, papers, and, collected, artefacts, were, donated, to, kingston, library, and, are, currently, under, the, ownership, of, kingston, museum, in, his, place, of, birth, according, to, an, exhibition, at, tate, britain, his, influence, has, forever, changed, our, understanding, and, interpretation, of, the, world, and, can, be, found, in, many, diverse, fields, from, marcel, duchamp, s, painting, nude, descending, a, staircase, and, countless, works, by, francis, bacon, to, the, blockbuster, film, the, matrix, and, philip, glass, s, opera, the, photographer, in, 2010, the, american, painter, philip, pearlstein, published, an, article, in, artnews, suggesting, the, strong, influences, muybridge, s, work, and, public, lectures, had, on, 20th, century, artists, including, degas, rodin, seurat, duchamp, and, eakins, either, directly, or, through, the, contemporaneous, work, of, his, fellow, photographic, pioneer, marey, he, concluded, i, believe, that, both, muybridge, and, eakins, as, a, photographer, should, be, recognized, as, among, the, most, influential, artists, on, the, ideas, of, 20th, century, art, along, with, c, zanne, whose, lessons, in, fractured, vision, provided, the, technical, basis, for, putting, those, ideas, together, muybridge, bequeathed, a, selection, of, his, equipment, to, kingston, museum, in, greater, london, this, includes, his, original, biunial, slide, lantern, a, zoopraxiscope, projector, over, 2, 000, glass,
