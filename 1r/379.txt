eug, ne, ionesco, french, born, eugen, ionescu, romanian, 26, november, 1909, 28, march, 1994, was, a, romanian, french, playwright, who, wrote, mostly, in, french, and, was, one, of, the, foremost, figures, of, the, french, avant, garde, theatre, in, the, 20th, century, ionesco, instigated, a, revolution, in, ideas, and, techniques, of, drama, beginning, with, his, anti, play, the, bald, soprano, which, contributed, to, the, beginnings, of, what, is, known, as, the, theatre, of, the, absurd, which, includes, a, number, of, plays, that, following, the, ideas, of, the, philosopher, albert, camus, explore, concepts, of, absurdism, and, surrealism, he, was, made, a, member, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, in, 1970, and, was, awarded, the, 1970, austrian, state, prize, for, european, literature, and, the, 1973, jerusalem, prize, ionesco, was, born, in, slatina, romania, his, father, belonged, to, the, orthodox, christian, church, his, mother, was, of, french, and, romanian, heritage, according, to, some, sources, her, faith, was, protestant, the, faith, into, which, her, father, was, born, and, to, which, her, originally, greek, orthodox, christian, mother, had, converted, according, to, other, sources, his, mother, was, jewish, however, this, has, been, contested, by, his, niece, eug, ne, was, baptized, into, the, orthodox, christian, faith, many, sources, cite, his, birthdate, as, 1912, this, error, being, due, to, vanity, on, the, part, of, ionesco, himself, who, wanted, the, year, of, his, birth, to, coincide, with, that, of, when, his, idol, romanian, playwright, caragiale, died, he, spent, most, of, his, childhood, in, france, and, while, there, had, an, experience, he, claimed, affected, his, perception, of, the, world, more, significantly, than, any, other, as, deborah, b, gaensbauer, describes, in, eug, ne, ionesco, revisited, walking, in, summer, sunshine, in, a, white, washed, provincial, village, under, an, intense, blue, sky, was, profoundly, altered, by, the, light, he, was, struck, very, suddenly, with, a, feeling, of, intense, luminosity, the, feeling, of, floating, off, the, ground, and, an, overwhelming, feeling, of, well, being, when, he, floated, back, to, the, ground, and, the, light, left, him, he, saw, that, the, real, world, in, comparison, was, full, of, decay, corruption, and, meaningless, repetitive, action, this, also, coincided, with, the, revelation, that, death, takes, everyone, in, the, end, much, of, his, later, work, reflecting, this, new, perception, demonstrates, a, disgust, for, the, tangible, world, a, distrust, of, communication, and, the, subtle, sense, that, a, better, world, lies, just, beyond, our, reach, echoes, of, this, experience, can, also, be, seen, in, references, and, themes, in, many, of, his, important, works, characters, pining, for, an, unattainable, city, of, lights, the, killer, the, chairs, or, perceiving, a, world, beyond, a, stroll, in, the, air, characters, granted, the, ability, to, fly, a, stroll, in, the, air, am, d, e, victims, of, duty, the, banality, of, the, world, which, often, leads, to, depression, the, b, renger, character, ecstatic, revelations, of, beauty, within, a, pessimistic, framework, am, d, e, the, chairs, the, b, renger, character, and, the, inevitability, of, death, exit, the, king, he, returned, to, romania, with, his, father, and, mother, in, 1925, after, his, parents, divorced, there, he, attended, saint, sava, national, college, after, which, he, studied, french, literature, at, the, university, of, bucharest, from, 1928, to, 1933, and, qualified, as, a, teacher, of, french, while, there, he, met, emil, cioran, and, mircea, eliade, and, the, three, became, lifelong, friends, in, 1936, ionesco, married, rodica, burileanu, they, had, one, daughter, marie, france, ionesco, for, whom, he, wrote, a, number, of, unconventional, children, s, stories, with, his, family, he, returned, to, france, in, 1938, for, him, to, complete, his, doctoral, thesis, caught, by, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, 1939, he, returned, to, romania, but, soon, changed, his, mind, and, with, the, help, of, friends, obtained, travel, documents, which, allowed, him, to, return, to, france, in, 1942, where, he, remained, during, the, rest, of, the, war, living, in, marseille, and, then, moving, with, his, family, to, paris, after, its, liberation, though, best, known, as, a, playwright, plays, were, not, his, first, chosen, medium, he, started, writing, poetry, and, criticism, publishing, in, several, romanian, journals, two, early, writings, of, note, are, nu, a, book, criticizing, many, other, writers, including, prominent, romanian, poets, and, hugoliade, or, the, grotesque, and, tragic, life, of, victor, hugo, a, satirical, biography, mocking, victor, hugo, s, status, as, a, great, figure, in, french, literature, the, hugoliade, includes, exaggerated, retellings, of, the, most, scandalous, episodes, in, hugo, s, life, and, contains, prototypes, for, many, of, ionesco, s, later, themes, the, ridiculous, authoritarian, character, the, false, worship, of, language, ionesco, began, his, theatre, career, later, in, life, he, did, not, write, his, first, play, until, 1948, la, cantatrice, chauve, first, performed, in, 1950, with, the, english, title, the, bald, soprano, at, the, age, of, 40, he, decided, to, learn, english, using, the, assimil, method, conscientiously, copying, whole, sentences, in, order, to, memorize, them, re, reading, them, he, began, to, feel, that, he, was, not, learning, english, rather, he, was, discovering, some, astonishing, truths, such, as, the, fact, that, there, are, seven, days, in, a, week, that, the, ceiling, is, up, and, the, floor, is, down, things, which, he, already, knew, but, which, suddenly, struck, him, as, being, as, stupefying, as, they, were, indisputably, true, this, feeling, intensified, with, the, introduction, in, later, lessons, of, the, characters, known, as, mr, and, mrs, smith, to, her, husband, s, astonishment, mrs, smith, informed, him, that, they, had, several, children, that, they, lived, in, the, vicinity, of, london, that, their, name, was, smith, that, mr, smith, was, a, clerk, and, that, they, had, a, servant, mary, who, was, english, like, themselves, what, was, remarkable, about, mrs, smith, ionesco, thought, was, her, eminently, methodical, procedure, in, her, quest, for, truth, for, ionesco, the, clich, s, and, truisms, of, the, conversation, primer, disintegrated, into, wild, caricature, and, parody, with, language, itself, disintegrating, into, disjointed, fragments, of, words, ionesco, set, about, translating, this, experience, into, a, play, la, cantatrice, chauve, which, was, performed, for, the, first, time, in, 1950, under, the, direction, of, nicolas, bataille, it, was, far, from, a, success, and, went, unnoticed, until, a, few, established, writers, and, critics, among, them, jean, anouilh, and, raymond, queneau, championed, the, play, ionesco, s, earliest, theatrical, works, considered, to, be, his, most, innovative, were, one, act, plays, or, extended, sketches, la, cantatrice, chauve, translated, as, the, bald, soprano, or, the, bald, prima, donna, written, 1948, jacques, ou, la, soumission, translated, as, jack, or, the, submission,

sketches, to, which, he, gave, such, descriptions, as, anti, play, anti, pi, ce, in, french, express, modern, feelings, of, alienation, and, the, impossibility, and, futility, of, communication, with, surreal, comic, force, parodying, the, conformism, of, the, bourgeoisie, and, conventional, theatrical, forms, in, them, ionesco, rejects, a, conventional, story, line, as, their, basis, instead, taking, their, dramatic, structure, from, accelerating, rhythms, and, or, cyclical, repetitions, he, disregards, psychology, and, coherent, dialogue, thereby, depicting, a, dehumanized, world, with, mechanical, puppet, like, characters, who, speak, in, non, sequiturs, language, becomes, rarefied, with, words, and, material, objects, gaining, a, life, of, their, own, increasingly, overwhelming, the, characters, and, creating, a, sense, of, menace, with, tueur, sans, gages, translated, as, the, killer, 1959, his, second, full, length, play, the, first, being, am, d, e, ou, comment, s, en, d, barrasser, in, 1954, ionesco, began, to, explore, more, sustained, dramatic, situations, featuring, more, humanized, characters, notably, this, includes, b, renger, a, central, character, in, a, number, of, ionesco, s, plays, the, last, of, which, is, le, pi, ton, de, l, air, translated, as, a, stroll, in, the, air, b, renger, is, a, semi, autobiographical, figure, expressing, ionesco, s, wonderment, and, anguish, at, the, strangeness, of, reality, he, is, comically, na, ve, engaging, the, audience, s, sympathy, in, the, killer, he, encounters, death, in, the, figure, of, a, serial, killer, in, rhinoc, ros, he, watches, his, friends, turning, into, rhinoceroses, one, by, one, until, he, alone, stands, unchanged, against, this, mass, movement, it, is, in, this, play, that, ionesco, most, forcefully, expresses, his, horror, of, ideological, conformism, inspired, by, the, rise, of, the, fascist, iron, guard, in, romania, in, the, 1930s, le, roi, se, meurt, translated, as, exit, the, king, 1962, shows, him, as, king, b, renger, i, an, everyman, figure, who, struggles, to, come, to, terms, with, his, own, death, ionesco, s, later, work, has, generally, received, less, attention, this, includes, la, soif, et, la, faim, translated, as, hunger, and, thirst, 1966, jeux, de, massacre, 1971, macbett, 1972, a, free, adaptation, of, shakespeare, s, macbeth, and, ce, formidable, bordel, 1973, ionesco, also, wrote, his, only, novel, the, hermit, during, this, later, period, it, was, first, published, in, 1975, apart, from, the, libretto, for, the, opera, maximilien, kolbe, music, by, dominique, probst, which, has, been, performed, in, five, countries, produced, for, television, and, recorded, for, release, on, cd, ionesco, did, not, write, for, the, stage, after, voyage, chez, les, morts, in, 1981, however, la, cantatrice, chauve, is, still, playing, at, the, th, tre, de, la, huchette, today, having, moved, there, in, 1952, it, holds, the, world, record, for, the, play, that, has, been, staged, continuously, in, the, same, theatre, for, the, longest, time, like, shaw, and, brecht, ionesco, contributed, to, the, theatre, with, his, theoretical, writings, wellwarth, 33, ionesco, wrote, mainly, in, attempts, to, correct, critics, whom, he, felt, misunderstood, his, work, and, therefore, wrongly, influenced, his, audience, in, doing, so, ionesco, articulated, ways, in, which, he, thought, contemporary, theatre, should, be, reformed, wellwarth, 33, notes, and, counter, notes, is, a, collection, of, ionesco, s, writings, including, musings, on, why, he, chose, to, write, for, the, theatre, and, direct, responses, to, his, contemporary, critics, in, the, first, section, titled, experience, of, the, theatre, ionesco, claimed, to, have, hated, going, to, the, theatre, as, a, child, because, it, gave, him, no, pleasure, or, feeling, of, participation, ionesco, 15, he, wrote, that, the, problem, with, realistic, theatre, is, that, it, is, less, interesting, than, theatre, that, invokes, an, imaginative, truth, which, he, found, to, be, much, more, interesting, and, freeing, than, the, narrow, truth, presented, by, strict, realism, ionesco, 15, he, claimed, that, drama, that, relies, on, simple, effects, is, not, necessarily, drama, simplified, ionesco, 28, notes, and, counter, notes, also, reprints, a, heated, war, of, words, between, ionesco, and, kenneth, tynan, based, on, ionesco, s, beliefs, and, ionesco, s, hatred, for, brecht, and, brechtian, theatre, ionesco, is, often, considered, a, writer, of, the, theatre, of, the, absurd, a, label, originally, given, to, him, by, martin, esslin, in, his, book, of, the, same, name, esslin, placed, ionesco, alongside, contemporaries, samuel, beckett, jean, genet, and, arthur, adamov, calling, this, informal, group, absurd, on, the, basis, of, albert, camus, concept, of, the, absurd, in, esslin, s, view, beckett, and, ionesco, better, captured, the, meaninglessness, of, existence, in, their, plays, than, works, by, camus, or, sartre, because, of, this, loose, association, ionesco, is, often, mislabeled, an, existentialist, ionesco, claimed, in, notes, and, counter, notes, that, he, was, not, an, existentialist, and, often, criticized, existentialist, figurehead, jean, paul, sartre, although, ionesco, knew, beckett, and, honored, his, work, the, french, group, of, playwrights, was, far, from, an, organized, movement, ionesco, on, the, metaphysics, of, death, in, through, parisian, eyes, reflections, on, contemporary, french, arts, and, culture, by, melinda, camber, porter, death, is, our, main, problem, and, all, others, are, less, important, it, is, the, wall, and, the, limit, it, is, the, only, inescapable, alienation, it, gives, us, a, sense, of, our, limits, but, the, ignorance, of, ourselves, and, of, others, to, which, we, are, condemned, is, just, as, worrying, in, the, final, analysis, we, don, t, know, what, we, re, doing, nevertheless, in, all, my, work, there, is, an, element, of, hope, and, an, appeal, to, others, ionesco, claimed, instead, an, affinity, for, pataphysics, and, its, creator, alfred, jarry, he, was, also, a, great, admirer, of, the, dadaists, and, surrealists, especially, his, fellow, countryman, tristan, tzara, ionesco, became, friends, with, andr, breton, whom, he, revered, in, present, past, past, present, ionesco, wrote, breton, taught, us, to, destroy, the, walls, of, the, real, that, separate, us, from, reality, to, participate, in, being, so, as, to, live, as, if, it, were, the, first, day, of, creation, a, day, that, would, every, day, be, the, first, day, of, new, creations, raymond, queneau, a, former, associate, of, breton, and, a, champion, of, ionesco, s, work, was, a,
