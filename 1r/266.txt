eighteen, in, late, november, and, early, december, 1623, he, suffered, a, nearly, fatal, illness, thought, to, be, either, typhus, or, a, combination, of, a, cold, followed, by, a, period, of, fever, during, his, convalescence, he, wrote, a, series, of, meditations, and, prayers, on, health, pain, and, sickness, that, were, published, as, a, book, in, 1624, under, the, title, of, devotions, upon, emergent, occasions, one, of, these, meditations, meditation, xvii, contains, the, well, known, phrases, no, man, is, an, iland, often, modernised, as, no, man, is, an, island, and, for, whom, the, bell, tolls, in, 1624, he, became, vicar, of, st, dunstan, in, the, west, and, in, 1625, a, prolocutor, to, charles, i, he, earned, a, reputation, as, an, eloquent, preacher, 160, of, his, sermons, have, survived, including, death, s, duel, his, famous, sermon, delivered, at, the, palace, of, whitehall, before, king, charles, i, in, february, 1631, donne, died, on, 31, march, 1631, he, was, buried, in, old, st, paul, s, cathedral, where, a, memorial, statue, of, him, by, nicholas, stone, was, erected, with, a, latin, epigraph, probably, composed, by, himself, the, memorial, was, one, of, the, few, to, survive, the, great, fire, of, london, in, 1666, and, is, now, in, st, paul, s, cathedral, the, statue, was, said, by, izaac, walton, in, his, biography, to, have, been, modelled, from, the, life, by, donne, to, suggest, his, appearance, at, the, resurrection, it, started, a, vogue, of, such, monuments, during, the, 17th, century, in, 2012, a, bust, of, the, poet, by, nigel, boonham, was, unveiled, outside, in, the, cathedral, churchyard, donne, s, earliest, poems, showed, a, developed, knowledge, of, english, society, coupled, with, sharp, criticism, of, its, problems, his, satires, dealt, with, common, elizabethan, topics, such, as, corruption, in, the, legal, system, mediocre, poets, and, pompous, courtiers, his, images, of, sickness, vomit, manure, and, plague, reflected, his, strongly, satiric, view, of, a, society, populated, by, fools, and, knaves, his, third, satire, however, deals, with, the, problem, of, true, religion, a, matter, of, great, importance, to, donne, he, argued, that, it, was, better, to, examine, carefully, one, s, religious, convictions, than, blindly, to, follow, any, established, tradition, for, none, would, be, saved, at, the, final, judgment, by, claiming, a, harry, or, a, martin, taught, this, donne, s, early, career, was, also, notable, for, his, erotic, poetry, especially, his, elegies, in, which, he, employed, unconventional, metaphors, such, as, a, flea, biting, two, lovers, being, compared, to, sex, donne, did, not, publish, these, poems, although, they, circulated, widely, in, manuscript, form, one, such, a, previously, unknown, manuscript, that, is, believed, to, be, one, of, the, largest, contemporary, collections, of, donne, s, work, among, that, of, others, was, found, at, melford, hall, in, november, 2018, some, have, speculated, that, donne, s, numerous, illnesses, financial, strain, and, the, deaths, of, his, friends, all, contributed, to, the, development, of, a, more, sombre, and, pious, tone, in, his, later, poems, the, change, can, be, clearly, seen, in, an, anatomy, of, the, world, 1611, a, poem, that, donne, wrote, in, memory, of, elizabeth, drury, daughter, of, his, patron, sir, robert, drury, of, hawstead, suffolk, this, poem, treats, elizabeth, s, demise, with, extreme, gloominess, using, it, as, a, symbol, for, the, fall, of, man, and, the, destruction, of, the, universe, the, increasing, gloominess, of, donne, s, tone, may, also, be, observed, in, the, religious, works, that, he, began, writing, during, the, same, period, having, converted, to, the, anglican, church, donne, quickly, became, noted, for, his, sermons, and, religious, poems, towards, the, end, of, his, life, donne, wrote, works, that, challenged, death, and, the, fear, that, it, inspired, in, many, on, the, grounds, of, his, belief, that, those, who, die, are, sent, to, heaven, to, live, eternally, one, example, of, this, challenge, is, his, holy, sonnet, x, death, be, not, proud, even, as, he, lay, dying, during, lent, in, 1631, he, rose, from, his, sickbed, and, delivered, the, death, s, duel, sermon, which, was, later, described, as, his, own, funeral, sermon, death, s, duel, portrays, life, as, a, steady, descent, to, suffering, and, death, death, becomes, merely, another, process, of, life, in, which, the, winding, sheet, of, the, womb, is, the, same, as, that, of, the, grave, hope, is, seen, in, salvation, and, immortality, through, an, embrace, of, god, christ, and, the, resurrection, his, work, has, received, much, criticism, over, the, years, especially, concerning, his, metaphysical, form, donne, is, generally, considered, the, most, prominent, member, of, the, metaphysical, poets, a, phrase, coined, in, 1781, by, samuel, johnson, following, a, comment, on, donne, by, john, dryden, dryden, had, written, of, donne, in, 1693, he, affects, the, metaphysics, not, only, in, his, satires, but, in, his, amorous, verses, where, nature, only, should, reign, and, perplexes, the, minds, of, the, fair, sex, with, nice, speculations, of, philosophy, when, he, should, engage, their, hearts, and, entertain, them, with, the, softnesses, of, love, in, life, of, cowley, from, samuel, johnson, s, 1781, work, of, biography, and, criticism, lives, of, the, most, eminent, english, poets, johnson, refers, to, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, in, which, there, appeared, a, race, of, writers, that, may, be, termed, the, metaphysical, poets, donne, s, immediate, successors, in, poetry, therefore, tended, to, regard, his, works, with, ambivalence, with, the, neoclassical, poets, regarding, his, conceits, as, abuse, of, the, metaphor, however, he, was, revived, by, romantic, poets, such, as, coleridge, and, browning, though, his, more, recent, revival, in, the, early, 20th, century, by, poets, such, as, t, s, eliot, and, critics, like, f, r, leavis, tended, to, portray, him, with, approval, as, an, anti, romantic, donne, is, considered, a, master, of, the, metaphysical, conceit, an, extended, metaphor, that, combines, two, vastly, different, ideas, into, a, single, idea, often, using, imagery, an, example, of, this, is, his, equation, of, lovers, with, saints, in, the, canonization, unlike, the, conceits, found, in, other, elizabethan, poetry, most, notably, petrarchan, conceits, which, formed, clich, d, comparisons, between, more, closely, related, objects, such, as, a, rose, and, love, metaphysical, conceits, go, to, a, greater, depth, in, comparing, two, completely, unlike, objects, one, of, the, most, famous, of, donne, s, conceits, is, found, in, a, valediction, forbidding, mourning, where, he, compares, the, apartness, of, two, separated, lovers, to, the, working, of, the, legs, of, a, compass, donne, s, works, are, also, witty, employing, paradoxes, puns, and, subtle, yet, remarkable, analogies, his, pieces, are, often, ironic, and, cynical, especially, regarding, love, and, human, motives, common, subjects, of, donne, s, poems, are, love, especially, in, his, early, life, death, especially, after, his, wife, s, death, and, religion, john, donne, s, poetry, represented, a, shift, from, classical, forms, to, more, personal, poetry, donne, is, noted, for, his, poetic, metre, which, was, structured, with, changing, and, jagged, rhythms, that, closely, resemble, casual, speech, it, was, for, this, that, the, more, classical, minded, ben, jonson, commented, that, donne, for, not, keeping, of, accent, deserved, hanging, some, scholars, believe, that, donne, s, literary, works, reflect, the, changing, trends, of, his, life, with, love, poetry, and, satires, from, his, youth, and, religious, sermons, during, his, later, years, other, scholars, such, as, helen, gardner, question, the, validity, of, this, dating, most, of, his, poems, were, published, posthumously, 1633, the, exception, to, these, is, his, anniversaries, which, were, published, in, 1612, and, devotions, upon, emergent, occasions, published, in, 1624, his, sermons, are, also, dated, sometimes, specifically, by, date, and, year, donne, is, remembered, in, the, calendar, of, saints, of, the, church, of, england, the, episcopal, church, liturgical, calendar, and, the, calendar, of, saints, of, the, evangelical, lutheran, church, in, america, for, his, life, as, both, poet, and, priest, his, commemoration, is, on, 31, march, during, his, lifetime, several, likenesses, were, made, of, the, poet, the, earliest, was, the, anonymous, portrait, of, 1594, now, in, the, national, portrait, gallery, london, which, was, restored, in, 2012, one, of, the, earliest, elizabethan, portraits, of, an, author, the, fashionably, dressed, poet, is, shown, darkly, brooding, on, his, love, the, portrait, was, described, in, donne, s, will, as, that, picture, of, myne, wych, is, taken, in, the, shaddowes, and, bequeathed, by, him, to, robert, kerr, 1st, earl, of, ancram, other, paintings, include, a, 1616, head, and, shoulders, after, isaac, oliver, also, in, the, national, portrait, gallery, and, a, 1622, head, and, shoulders, in, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, in, 1911, the, young, stanley, spencer, devoted, a, visionary, painting, to, john, donne, arriving, in, heaven, 1911, which, is, now, in, the, fitzwilliam, museum, donne, s, reception, until, the, 20th, century, was, influenced, by, the, publication, of, his, writings, in, the, 17th, century, because, donne, avoided, publication, during, his, life, the, majority, of, his, works, were, brought, to, the, press, by, others, in, the, decades, after, his, death, these, publications, present, what, erin, mccarthy, calls, a, teleological, narrative, of, donne, s, growth, from, young, rake, jack, donne, to, reverend, divine, dr, donne, for, example, while, the, first, edition, of, poems, by, j, d, 1633, mingled, amorous, and, pious, verse, indiscriminately, all, editions, after, 1635, separated, poems, into, songs, and, sonnets, and, divine, poems, this, organization, promulgated, the, tale, of, jack, donne, s, transformation, into, doctor, donne, and, made, it, the, dominant, way, of, understanding, donne, s, life, and, work, a, similar, effort, to, justify, donne, s, early, writings, appeared, in, the, publication, of, his, prose, this, pattern, can, be, seen, in, a, 1652, volume, that, combines, texts, from, throughout, donne, s, career, including, flippant, works, like, ignatius, his, conclave, and, more, pious, writings, like, essays, in, divinity, in, the, preface, donne, s, son, unifies, the, otherwise, disparate, texts, around, an, impression, of, donne, s, divinity, by, comparing, his, father, s, varied, writing, to, jesus, miracles, christ, began, his, first, miracle, here, by, turning, water, into, wine, and, made, it, his, last, to, ascend, from, earth, to, heaven, donne, first, wrote, things, conducing, to, cheerfulness, entertainment, of, mankind, and, later, change, his, conversation, from, men, to, angels, another, figure, who, contributed, to, donne, s, legacy, as, a, rake, turned, preacher, was, donne, s, first, biographer, izaak, walton, walton, s, biography, separated, donne, s, life, into, two, stages, comparing, donne, s, life, to, the, transformation, of, st, paul, walton, writes, where, had, been, a, saul, in, his, irregular, youth, he, became, a, paul, and, preach, salvation, to, his, brethren, the, idea, that, donne, s, writings, reflect, two, distinct, stages, of, his, life, remains, common, however, many, scholars, have, challenged, this, understanding, in, 1948, evelyn, simpson, wrote, a, close, study, of, his, works, makes, it, clear, that, his, was, no, case, of, dual, personality, he, was, not, a, jekyll, hyde, in, jacobean, dress, there, is, an, essential, unity, underlying, the, flagrant, and, manifold, contradictions, of, his, temperament, after, donne, s, death, a, number, of, poetical, tributes, were, paid, to, him, of, which, one, of, the, principal, and, most, difficult, to, follow, was, his, friend, lord, herbert, of, cherbury, s, elegy, for, doctor, donne, posthumous, editions, of, donne, s, poems, were, accompanied, by, several, elegies, upon, the, author, over, the, course, of, the, next, two, centuries, six, of, these, were, written, by, fellow, churchmen, others, by, such, courtly, writers, as, thomas, carew, sidney, godolphin, and, endymion, porter, in, 1963, came, joseph, brodsky, s, the, great, elegy, for, john, donne, beginning, in, the, 20th, century, several, historical, novels, appeared, taking, as, their, subject, various, episodes, in, donne, s, life, his, courtship, of, anne, more, is, the, subject, of, elizabeth, gray, vining, s, take, heed, of, loving, me, a, novel, about, john, donne, 1963, and, maeve, haran, s, the, lady, and, the, poet, 2010, both, characters, also, make, interspersed, appearances, in, mary, novik, s, conceit, 2007, where, the, main, focus, is, on, their, rebellious, daughter, pegge, english, treatments, include, garry, o, connor, s, death, s, duel, a, novel, of, john, donne, 2015, which, deals, with, the, poet, as, a, young, man,
