and, served, as, beylerbey, of, the, balkans, the, younger, son, renamed, mesih, pasha, became, admiral, of, the, ottoman, fleet, and, sanjak, bey, of, the, gallipoli, he, eventually, served, twice, as, grand, vizier, under, mehmed, s, son, bayezid, ii, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, mehmed, would, also, go, on, to, conquer, the, despotate, of, morea, in, the, peloponnese, in, two, campaigns, in, 1458, and, 1460, and, the, empire, of, trebizond, in, northeastern, anatolia, in, 1461, the, last, two, vestiges, of, byzantine, rule, were, thus, absorbed, by, the, ottoman, empire, the, conquest, of, constantinople, bestowed, immense, glory, and, prestige, on, the, country, there, is, some, historical, evidence, that, 10, years, after, the, conquest, of, constantinople, mehmed, ii, visited, the, site, of, troy, and, boasted, that, he, had, avenged, the, trojans, by, conquering, the, greeks, byzantines, mehmed, ii, s, first, campaigns, after, constantinople, were, in, the, direction, of, serbia, which, had, been, an, ottoman, vassal, state, intermittently, since, the, battle, of, kosovo, in, 1389, the, ottoman, ruler, had, a, connection, with, the, serbian, despotate, one, of, murad, ii, s, wives, was, mara, brankovi, and, he, used, that, fact, to, claim, serbian, lands, ura, brankovi, s, recently, made, alliance, with, the, hungarians, and, his, irregular, payments, of, tribute, further, served, as, justifications, for, the, invasion, the, ottomans, sent, an, ultimatum, demanding, the, keys, to, some, serbian, castles, which, formerly, belonged, to, the, ottomans, when, serbia, refused, these, demands, the, ottoman, army, led, by, mehmed, set, out, from, edirne, towards, serbia, in, 1454, sometime, after, the, 18th, of, april, mehmed, s, forces, quickly, succeeded, in, capturing, sivricehisar, sometimes, identified, with, the, ostrvica, fortress, and, omolhisar, and, repulsed, a, serbian, cavalry, force, of, 9, 000, cavalry, sent, against, them, by, the, despot, following, these, actions, the, serbian, capital, of, smederevo, was, put, under, siege, by, the, ottoman, forces, before, the, city, could, be, taken, intelligence, was, received, about, an, approaching, hungarian, relief, force, led, by, hunyadi, which, caused, mehmed, to, lift, the, siege, and, start, marching, back, to, his, domains, by, august, the, campaign, was, effectively, over, mehmed, left, a, part, of, his, force, under, the, command, of, firuz, bey, in, serbia, in, anticipation, of, a, possible, offensive, on, ottoman, territories, by, hunyadi, this, force, was, defeated, by, a, combined, hungarian, serbian, army, led, by, hunyadi, and, nikola, skobalji, on, the, 2nd, of, october, near, kru, evac, after, which, hunyadi, went, on, to, raid, ottoman, controlled, nish, and, pirot, before, returning, back, to, belgrade, roughly, a, month, later, on, the, 16th, of, november, the, ottomans, avenged, their, earlier, defeat, at, kru, evac, by, defeating, skobalji, s, army, near, tripolje, where, the, serbian, voivode, was, captured, and, executed, via, impalement, following, this, a, temporary, treaty, was, signed, with, the, serbian, despot, where, ura, would, formally, recognize, the, recently, captured, serbian, forts, as, ottoman, land, send, thirty, thousand, florins, to, the, porte, as, yearly, tribute, and, provide, troops, for, ottoman, campaigns, the, 1454, campaign, had, resulted, in, the, capture, of, fifty, thousand, prisoners, from, serbia, four, thousand, of, whom, were, settled, in, various, villages, near, constantinople, the, following, year, mehmed, received, reports, from, one, of, his, frontier, commanders, about, serbian, weakness, against, a, possible, invasion, the, reports, in, combination, with, the, dissatisfactory, results, of, the, 1454, campaign, convinced, mehmed, to, initiate, another, campaign, against, serbia, the, ottoman, army, marched, on, the, important, mining, town, of, novo, brdo, which, mehmed, put, under, siege, the, serbians, couldn, t, resist, the, ottoman, army, out, in, the, open, thus, resorted, to, fortifying, their, various, settlements, and, having, their, peasants, flee, to, either, various, fortresses, or, forests, after, forty, days, of, siege, and, intense, cannon, fire, novo, brdo, surrendered, following, the, conquest, of, the, city, mehmed, captured, various, other, serbian, settlements, in, the, surrounding, area, after, which, he, started, his, march, back, towards, edirne, visiting, his, ancestor, murad, i, s, grave, in, kosovo, on, the, way, in, 1456, mehmed, decided, to, continue, his, momentum, towards, the, northwest, and, capture, the, city, of, belgrade, which, had, been, ceded, to, the, kingdom, of, hungary, by, the, serbian, despot, ura, brankovi, in, 1427, significant, preparations, were, made, by, the, sultan, for, the, conquest, of, the, city, including, the, casting, of, 22, large, cannons, alongside, many, smaller, ones, and, the, establishment, of, a, navy, which, would, sail, up, the, danube, to, aid, the, army, during, the, siege, the, exact, number, of, troops, mehmed, commanded, varies, between, sources, but, the, rumours, of, its, size, were, significant, enough, to, cause, panic, in, italy, on, the, 13th, of, june, the, ottoman, army, reached, belgrade, after, the, necessary, preparations, were, finished, ottoman, cannons, started, bombarding, the, city, walls, and, ottoman, troops, started, filling, the, ditches, in, front, the, walls, with, earth, to, advance, forward, as, despair, started, to, set, in, amongst, the, defenders, news, started, arriving, of, a, relief, force, assembling, across, the, danube, under, the, command, of, john, hunyadi, upon, learning, of, this, development, mehmed, held, a, war, council, with, his, commanders, to, determine, the, army, s, next, actions, karaca, pasha, recommended, that, a, part, of, the, army, should, cross, the, danube, to, counter, the, approaching, relief, army, this, plan, was, rejected, by, the, council, particularly, due, to, the, opposition, by, the, rumelian, begs, instead, the, decision, was, made, to, prioritize, capturing, the, fortress, a, move, seen, as, a, tactical, blunder, by, modern, historians, this, allowed, hunyadi, to, set, up, camp, with, his, army, across, the, danube, uncontested, shortly, after, the, ottoman, navy, was, defeated, in, a, five, hour, long, battle, by, the, newly, arrived, christian, danubian, navy, following, this, hunyadi, s, troops, started, entering, the, city, to, reinforce, the, besieged, which, increased, the, morale, of, the, defending, forces, infuriated, by, the, unfolding, events, mehmed, ordered, a, final, attack, to, capture, the, city, on, the, 21st, of, july, after, continuous, cannon, fire, building, up, to, the, day, of, the, attack, ottoman, troops, were, initially, successful, in, breaching, the, defences, and, entering, the, city, however, were, eventually, repulsed, by, the, defenders, the, christians, pressed, their, advantage, by, launching, a, counter, attack, which, started, pushing, back, the, ottoman, forces, managing, to, advance, as, far, as, the, ottoman, camp, at, this, crucial, point, of, the, battle, one, of, the, viziers, adviced, mehmed, to, abandon, the, camp, for, his, safety, which, he, refused, to, do, so, on, the, grounds, that, it, would, be, a, sign, of, cowardice, after, this, mehmed, personally, joined, the, fighting, accompanied, by, two, of, his, begs, the, sultan, managed, to, personally, kill, three, enemy, soldiers, before, being, injured, forcing, him, to, abandon, the, battlefield, the, news, of, their, sultan, fighting, alongside, them, caused, a, morale, boost, amongst, the, ottoman, troops, which, allowed, them, to, go, on, the, offensive, again, and, push, the, christian, forces, out, of, the, ottoman, camp, the, actions, of, the, sultan, had, prevented, a, complete, rout, of, the, ottoman, army, however, the, army, had, been, far, too, weakened, to, attempt, to, take, the, city, again, causing, the, ottoman, war, council, to, decide, on, ending, the, siege, the, sultan, and, his, army, retreated, to, edirne, without, the, christian, forces, being, able, to, pursue, them, hunyadi, died, shortly, after, the, siege, meanwhile, ura, brankovi, regained, possession, of, some, parts, of, serbia, before, the, end, of, the, year, however, the, 79, year, old, brankovi, died, serbian, independence, survived, him, for, only, two, years, when, the, ottoman, empire, formally, annexed, his, lands, following, dissension, among, his, widow, and, three, remaining, sons, lazar, the, youngest, poisoned, his, mother, and, exiled, his, brothers, but, he, died, soon, afterwards, in, the, continuing, turmoil, the, oldest, brother, stefan, brankovi, gained, the, throne, but, was, ousted, in, march, 1459, after, that, the, serbian, throne, was, offered, to, stephen, toma, evi, the, future, king, of, bosnia, which, infuriated, sultan, mehmed, he, sent, his, army, which, captured, smederevo, in, june, 1459, ending, the, existence, of, the, serbian, despotate, the, despotate, of, the, morea, bordered, the, southern, ottoman, balkans, the, ottomans, had, already, invaded, the, region, under, murad, ii, destroying, the, byzantine, defenses, the,

of, 1446, with, mehmed, ii, resulted, in, an, albanian, greek, revolt, against, them, during, which, the, brothers, invited, ottoman, troops, to, help, put, down, the, revolt, at, this, time, a, number, of, influential, moreote, greeks, and, albanians, made, private, peace, with, mehmed, after, more, years, of, incompetent, rule, by, the, despots, their, failure, to, pay, their, annual,

with, raids, and, counter, raids, but, a, shortage, of, manpower, and, money, meant, that, the, venetians, remained, largely, confined, to, their, fortified, bases, while, mer, bey, s, army, roamed, the, countryside, in, the, aegean, the, venetians, tried, to, take, lesbos, in, the, spring, of, 1464, and, besieged, the, capital, mytilene, for, six, weeks, until, the, arrival, of, an, ottoman,

army, against, the, albanians, under, their, leader, skanderbeg, they, had, long, resisted, the, ottomans, and, had, repeatedly, sought, assistance, from, italy, mehmed, ii, responded, by, marching, again, against, albania, but, was, unsuccessful, the, winter, brought, an, outbreak, of, plague, which, would, recur, annually, and, sap, the, strength, of, the, local, resistance, skanderbeg, himself, died, of, malaria, in, the, venetian, stronghold, of, lissus, lezh, ending, the, ability, of, venice, to, use, the, albanian, lords, for, its, own, advantage, after, skanderbeg, died, some, venetian, controlled, northern, albanian, garrisons, continued, to, hold, territories, coveted, by, the, ottomans, such, as, abljak, crnojevi, a, drisht, lezh, and, shkodra, the, most, significant, mehmed, ii, sent, his, armies, to, take, shkodra, in, 1474, but, failed, then, he, went, personally, to, lead, the, siege, of, shkodra, of, 1478, 79, the, venetians, and, shkodrans, resisted, the, assaults, and, continued, to, hold, the, fortress, until, venice, ceded, shkodra, to, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, treaty, of, constantinople, as, a, condition, of, ending, the, war, the, agreement, was, established, as, a, result, of, the, ottomans, having, reached, the, outskirts, of, venice, based, on, the, terms, of, the, treaty, the, venetians, were, allowed, to, keep, ulcinj, antivan, and, durr, s, however, they, ceded, shkodra, which, had, been, under, ottoman, siege, for, many, months, as, well, as, other, territories, on, the, dalmatian, coastline, and, they, relinquished, control, of, the, greek, islands, of, negroponte, euboea, and, lemnos, moreover, the, venetians, were, forced, to, pay, 100, 000, ducat, indemnity, and, agreed, to, a, tribute, of, around, 10, 000, ducats, per, year, in, order, to, acquire, trading, privileges, in, the, black, sea, as, a, result, of, this, treaty, venice, acquired, a, weakened, position, in, the, levant, during, the, post, seljuks, era, in, the, second, half, of, the, middle, ages, numerous, turkmen, principalities, collectively, known, as, anatolian, beyliks, emerged, in, anatolia, karamanids, initially, centred, around, the, modern, provinces, of, karaman, and, konya, the, most, important, power, in, anatolia, but, towards, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, ottomans, began, to, dominate, on, most, of, anatolia, reducing, the, karaman, influence, and, prestige, brahim, ii, of, karaman, was, the, ruler, of, karaman, and, during, his, last, years, his, sons, began, struggling, for, the, throne, his, heir, apparent, was, shak, of, karaman, the, governor, of, silifke, but, pir, ahmet, a, younger, son, declared, himself, as, the, bey, of, karaman, in, konya, brahim, escaped, to, a, small, city, in, western, territories, where, he, died, in, 1464, the, competing, claims, to, the, throne, resulted, in, an, interregnum, in, the, beylik, nevertheless, with, the, help, of, uzun, hasan, shak, was, able, to, ascend, to, the, throne, his, reign, was, short, however, as, pir, ahmet, appealed, to, sultan, mehmed, ii, for, help, offering, mehmed, some, territory, that, shak, refused, to, cede, with, ottoman, help, pir, ahmet, defeated, shak, in, the, battle, of, da, pazar, shak, had, to, be, content, with, silifke, up, to, an, unknown, date, pir, ahmet, kept, his, promise, and, ceded, a, part, of, the, beylik, to, the, ottomans, but, he, was, uneasy, about, the, loss, so, during, the, ottoman, campaign, in, the, west, he, recaptured, his, former, territory, mehmed, returned, however, and, captured, both, karaman, larende, and, konya, in, 1466, pir, ahmet, barely, escaped, to, the, east, a, few, years, later, ottoman, vizier, later, grand, vizier, gedik, ahmet, pasha, captured, the, coastal, region, of, the, beylik, pir, ahmet, as, well, as, his, brother, kas, m, escaped, to, uzun, hasan, s, territory, this, gave, uzun, hasan, a, chance, to, interfere, in, 1472, the, akkoyunlu, army, invaded, and, raided, most, of, anatolia, this, was, the, reason, behind, the, battle, of, otlukbeli, in, 1473, but, then, mehmed, led, a, successful, campaign, against, uzun, hasan, in, 1473, that, resulted, in, the, decisive, victory, of, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, battle, of, otlukbeli, before, that, pir, ahmet, with, akkoyunlu, help, had, captured, karaman, however, pir, ahmet, could, not, enjoy, another, term, because, immediately, after, the, capture, of, karaman, the, akkoyunlu, army, was, defeated, by, the, ottomans, near, bey, ehir, and, pir, ahmet, had, to, escape, once, more, although, he, tried, to, continue, his, struggle, he, learned, that, his, family, members, had, been, transferred, to, istanbul, by, gedik, ahmet, pasha, so, he, finally, gave, up, demoralized, he, escaped, to, akkoyunlu, territory, where, he, was, given, a, t, mar, fief, in, bayburt, he, died, in, 1474, uniting, the, anatolian, beylik, s, was, first, accomplished, by, sultan, bayezid, i, more, than, fifty, years, before, mehmed, ii, but, after, the, destructive, battle, of, ankara, in, 1402, the, newly, formed, unification, was, gone, mehmed, ii, recovered, ottoman, power, over, the, other, turkish, states, and, these, conquests, allowed, him, to, push, further, into, europe, another, important, political, entity, that, shaped, the, eastern, policy, of, mehmed, ii, were, the, aq, qoyunlu, under, the, leadership, of, uzun, hasan, this, kingdom, gained, power, in, the, east, but, because, of, its, strong, relations, with, christian, powers, like, the, empire, of, trebizond, and, the, republic, of, venice, and, the, alliance, between, the, turcomans, and, the, karamanid, tribe, mehmed, saw, them, as, a, threat, to, his, own, power, in, 1456, peter, iii, aaron, agreed, to, pay, the, ottomans, an, annual, tribute, of, 2, 000, gold, ducats, to, ensure, his, southern, borders, thus, becoming, the, first, moldavian, ruler, to, accept, the, turkish, demands, his, successor, stephen, the, great, rejected, ottoman, suzerainty, and, a, series, of, fierce, wars, ensued, stephen, tried, to, bring, wallachia, under, his, sphere, of, influence, and, so, supported, his, own, choice, for, the, wallachian, throne, this, resulted, in, an, enduring, struggle, between, different, wallachian, rulers, backed, by, hungarians, ottomans, and, stephen, an, ottoman, army, under, hadim, pasha, governor, of, rumelia, was, sent, in, 1475, to, punish, stephen, for, his, meddling, in, wallachia, however, the, ottomans, suffered, a, great, defeat, at, the, battle, of, vaslui, stephen, inflicted, a, decisive, defeat, on, the, ottomans, described, as, the, greatest, ever, secured, by, the, cross, against, islam, with, casualties, according, to, venetian, and, polish, records, reaching, beyond, 40, 000, on, the, ottoman, side, mara, brankovic, mara, hatun, the, former, younger, wife, of, murad, ii, told, a, venetian, envoy, that, the, invasion, had, been, worst, ever, defeat, for, the, ottomans, stephen, was, later, awarded, the, title, athleta, christi, champion, of, christ, by, pope, sixtus, iv, who, referred, to, him, as, verus, christianae, fidei, athleta, the, true, defender, of, the, christian, faith, mehmed, ii, assembled, a, large, army, and, entered, moldavia, in, june, 1476, meanwhile, groups, of, tartars, from, the, crimean, khanate, the, ottomans, recent, ally, were, sent, to, attack, moldavia, romanian, sources, may, state, that, they, were, repelled, other, sources, state, that, joint, ottoman, and, crimean, tartar, forces, occupied, bessarabia, and, took, akkerman, gaining, control, of, the, southern, mouth, of, the, danube, stephan, tried, to, avoid, open, battle, with, the, ottomans, by, following, a, scorched, earth, policy, finally, stephen, faced, the, ottomans, in, battle, the, moldavians, luring, the, main, ottoman, forces, into, a, forest, that, was, set, on, fire, causing, some, casualties, according, to, another, battle, description, the, defending, moldavian, forces, repelled, several, ottoman, attacks, with, steady, fire, from, hand, guns, the, attacking, turkish, janissaries, were, forced, to, crouch, on, their, stomachs, instead, of, charging, headlong, into, the, defenders, positions, seeing, the, imminent, defeat, of, his, forces, mehmed, charged, with, his, personal, guard, against, the, moldavians, managing, to, rally, the, janissaries, and, turning, the, tide, of, the, battle, turkish, janissaries, penetrated, inside, the, forest, and, engaged, the, defenders, in, man, to, man, fighting, the, moldavian, army, was, utterly, defeated, casualties, were, very, high, on, both, sides, and, the, chronicles, say, that, the, entire, battlefield, was, covered, with, the, bones, of, the, dead, a, probable, source, for, the, toponym, valea, alb, is, romanian, and, akdere, turkish, for, the, white, valley, stephen, the, great, retreated, into, the, north, western, part, of, moldavia, or, even, into, the, polish, kingdom, and, began, forming, another, army, the, ottomans, were, unable, to, conquer, any, of, the, major, moldavian, strongholds, suceava, neam, and, hotin, and, were, constantly, harassed, by, small, scale, moldavian, attacks, soon, they, were, also, confronted, with, starvation, a, situation, made, worse, by, an, outbreak, of, the, plague, and, the, ottoman, army, returned, to, ottoman, lands, the, threat, of, stephen, to, wallachia, continued, for, decades, that, very, same, year, stephen, helped, his, cousin, vlad, the, impaler, return, to, the, throne, of, wallachia, for, the, third, and, final, time, even, after, vlad, s, untimely, death, several, months, later, stephen, continued, to, support, with, force, of, arms, a, variety, of, contenders, to, the, wallachian, throne, succeeding, after, mehmet, s, death, to, instate, vlad, c, lug, rul, half, brother, to, vlad, the, impaler, for, a, period, of, 13, years, from, 1482, to, 1495, skanderbeg, a, member, of, the, albanian, nobility, and, a, former, member, of, the, ottoman, ruling, elite, led, a, rebellion, against, the, expansion, of, the, ottoman, empire, into, europe, skanderbeg, son, of, gjon, kastrioti, who, had, joined, the, unsuccessful, albanian, revolt, of, 1432, 1436, united, the, albanian, principalities, in, a, military, and, diplomatic, alliance, the, league, of, lezh, in, 1444, mehmed, ii, was, never, successful, in, his, efforts, to, subjugate, albania, while, skanderbeg, was, alive, even, though, he, twice, 1466, and, 1467, led, the, ottoman, armies, himself, against, kruj, after, skanderbeg, died, in, 1468, the, albanians, could, not, find, a, leader, to, replace, him, and, mehmed, ii, eventually, conquered, kruj, and, albania, in, 1478, in, spring, 1466, sultan, mehmed, marched, with, a, large, army, against, skanderbeg, and, the, albanians, skanderbeg, had, repeatedly, sought, assistance, from, italy, and, believed, that, the, ongoing, ottoman, venetian, war, 1463, 1479, offered, a, golden, opportunity, to, reassert, albanian, independence, for, the, venetians, the, albanians, provided, a, useful, cover, to, the, venetian, coastal, holdings, of, durr, s, italian, durazzo, and, shkod, r, italian, scutari, the, major, result, of, this, campaign, was, the, construction, of, the, fortress, of, elbasan, allegedly, within, just, 25, days, this, strategically, sited, fortress, at, the, lowlands, near, the, end, of, the, old, via, egnatia, cut, albania, effectively, in, half, isolating, skanderbeg, s, base, in, the, northern, highlands, from, the, venetian, holdings, in, the, south, however, following, the, sultan, s, withdrawal, skanderbeg, himself, spent, the, winter, in, italy, seeking, aid, on, his, return, in, early, 1467, his, forces, sallied, from, the, highlands, defeated, ballaban, pasha, and, lifted, the, siege, of, the, fortress, of, croia, kruj, they, also, attacked, elbasan, but, failed, to, capture, it, mehmed, ii, responded, by, marching, again, against, albania, he, energetically, pursued, the, attacks, against, the, albanian, strongholds, while, sending, detachments, to, raid, the, venetian, possessions, to, keep, them, isolated, the, ottomans, failed, again, to, take, croia, and, they, failed, to, subjugate, the, country, however, the, winter, brought, an, outbreak, of, plague, which, would, recur, annually, and, sap, the, strength, of, the, local, resistance, skanderbeg, himself, died, of, malaria, in, the, venetian, stronghold, of, lissus, lezh, ending, the, ability, of, venice, to, use, the, albanian, lords, for, its, own, advantage, the, albanians, were, left, to, their, own, devices, and, were, gradually, subdued, over, the, next, decade, after, skanderbeg, died, mehmed, ii, personally, led, the, siege, of, shkodra, in, 1478, 79, of, which, early, ottoman, chronicler, a, kpa, azade, 1400, 81, wrote, all, the, conquests, of, sultan, mehmed, were, fulfilled, with, the, seizure, of, shkodra, the, venetians, and, shkodrans, resisted, the, assaults, and, continued, to, hold, the, fortress, until, venice, ceded, shkodra, to, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, treaty, of, constantinople, as, a, condition, of, ending, the, war, a, number, of, turkic, peoples, collectively, known, as, the, crimean, tatars, had, been, inhabiting, the, peninsula, since, the, early, middle, ages, after, the, destruction, of, the, golden, horde, by, timur, earlier, in, the, 15th, century, the, crimean, tatars, founded, an, independent, crimean, khanate, under, hac, i, giray, a, descendant, of, genghis, khan, the, crimean, tatars, controlled, the, steppes, that, stretched, from, the, kuban, to, the, dniester, river, but, they, were, unable, to, take, control, over, the, commercial, genoese, towns, called, gazaria, genoese, colonies, which, had, been, under, genoese, control, since, 1357, after, the, conquest, of, constantinople, genoese, communications, were, disrupted, and, when, the, crimean, tatars, asked, for, help, from, the, ottomans, they, responded, with, an, invasion, of, the, genoese, towns, led, by, gedik, ahmed, pasha, in, 1475, bringing, kaffa, and, the, other, trading, towns, under, their, control, after, the, capture, of, the, genoese, towns, the, ottoman, sultan, held, me, li, i, giray, captive, later, releasing, him, in, return, for, accepting, ottoman, suzerainty, over, the, crimean, khans, and, allowing, them, to, rule, as, tributary, princes, of, the, ottoman, empire, however, the, crimean, khans, still, had, a, large, amount, of, autonomy, from, the, ottoman, empire, while, the, ottomans, directly, controlled, the, southern, coast, an, ottoman, army, under, gedik, ahmed, pasha, invaded, italy, in, 1480, capturing, otranto, because, of, lack, of, food, gedik, ahmed, pasha, returned, with, most, of, his, troops, to, albania, leaving, a, garrison, of, 800, infantry, and, 500, cavalry, behind, to, defend, otranto, in, italy, it, was, assumed, he, would, return, after, the, winter, since, it, was, only, 28, years, after, the, fall, of, constantinople, there, was, some, fear, that, rome, would, suffer, the, same, fate, plans, were, made, for, the, pope, and, citizens, of, rome, to, evacuate, the, city, pope, sixtus, iv, repeated, his, 1481, call, for, a, crusade, several, italian, city, states, hungary, and, france, responded, positively, to, the, appeal, the, republic, of, venice, did, not, however, as, it, had, signed, an, expensive, peace, treaty, with, the, ottomans, in, 1479, in, 1481, king, ferdinand, i, of, naples, raised, an, army, to, be, led, by, his, son, alphonso, ii, of, naples, a, contingent, of, troops, was, provided, by, king, matthias, corvinus, of, hungary, the, city, was, besieged, starting, 1, may, 1481, after, the, death, of, mehmed, on, 3, may, ensuing, quarrels, about, his, succession, possibly, prevented, the, ottomans, from, sending, reinforcements, to, otranto, so, the, turkish, occupation, of, otranto, ended, by, negotiation, with, the, christian, forces, permitting, the, turks, to, withdraw, to, albania, and, otranto, was, retaken, by, papal, forces, in, 1481, after, conquering, constantinople, when, mehmed, ii, finally, entered, the, city, through, what, is, now, known, as, the, topkapi, gate, he, immediately, rode, his, horse, to, the, hagia, sophia, where, he, ordered, the, building, to, be, protected, he, ordered, that, an, imam, meet, him, there, in, order, to, chant, the, muslim, creed, i, testify, that, there, is, no, god, but, allah, i, testify, that, muhammad, is, the, messenger, of, allah, the, orthodox, cathedral, was, transformed, into, a, muslim, mosque, through, a, charitable, trust, solidifying, islamic, rule, in, constantinople, mehmed, s, main, concern, with, constantinople, was, with, rebuilding, the, city, s, defenses, and, repopulation, building, projects, were, commenced, immediately, after, the, conquest, which, included, the, repair, of, the, walls, construction, of, the, citadel, a, remarkable, hospital, with, students, and, medical, staff, a, large, cultural, complex, two, sets, of, barracks, for, the, janissaries, a, tophane, gun, foundry, outside, galata, and, a, new, palace, to, encourage, the, return, of, the, greeks, and, the, genoese, who, had, fled, from, galata, the, trading, quarter, of, the, city, he, returned, their, houses, and, provided, them, with, guarantees, of, safety, mehmed, issued, orders, across, his, empire, that, muslims, christians, and, jews, should, resettle, in, the, city, demanding, that, five, thousand, households, needed, to, be, transferred, to, constantinople, by, september, from, all, over, the, islamic, empire, prisoners, of, war, and, deported, people, were, sent, to, the, city, these, people, were, called, s, rg, n, in, turkish, greek, sourgounides, immigrants, mehmed, restored, the, ecumenical, orthodox, patriarchate, 6, january, 1454, monk, gennadios, being, appointed, as, the, first, orthodox, patriarch, and, established, a, jewish, grand, rabbinate, akham, bashi, and, the, prestigious, armenian, patriarchate, of, constantinople, in, the, capital, as, part, of, the, millet, system, in, addition, he, founded, and, encouraged, his, viziers, to, found, a, number, of, muslim, institutions, and, commercial, installations, in, the, main, districts, of, constantinople, such, as, the, rum, mehmed, pasha, mosque, built, by, the, grand, vizier, rum, mehmed, pasha, from, these, nuclei, the, metropolis, developed, rapidly, according, to, a, survey, carried, out, in, 1478, there, were, then, in, constantinople, and, neighboring, galata, 16, 324, households, 3, 927, shops, and, an, estimated, population, of, 80, 000, the, population, was, about, 60, muslim, 20, christian, and, 10, jewish, by, the, end, of, his, reign, mehmed, s, ambitious, rebuilding, program, had, changed, the, city, into, a, thriving, imperial, capital, according, to, the, contemporary, ottoman, historian, ne, ri, sultan, mehmed, created, all, of, istanbul, fifty, years, later, constantinople, had, again, become, the, largest, city, in, europe, two, centuries, later, the, well, known, ottoman, itinerant, evliya, elebi, gave, a, list, of, groups, introduced, into, the, city, with, their, respective, origins, even, today, many, quarters, of, istanbul, such, as, aksaray, and, ar, amba, bear, the, names, of, the, places, of, origin, of, their, inhabitants, however, many, people, escaped, again, from, the, city, and, there, were, several, outbreaks, of, plague, so, that, in, 1459, mehmed, allowed, the, deported, greeks, to, come, back, to, the, city, this, measure, apparently, had, no, great, success, since, french, voyager, pierre, gilles, wrote, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, that, the, greek, population, of, constantinople, was, unable, to, name, any, of, the, ancient, byzantine, churches, that, had, been, transformed, into, mosques, or, abandoned, this, shows, that, the, population, substitution, had, been, total, mehmed, ii, introduced, the, word, politics, into, arabic, siyasah, from, a, book, he, published, and, claimed, to, be, the, collection, of, politics, doctrines, of, the, byzantine, caesars, before, him, he, gathered, italian, artists, humanists, and, greek, scholars, at, his, court, allowed, the, byzantine, church, to, continue, functioning, ordered, the, patriarch, gennadius, to, translate, christian, doctrine, into, turkish, and, called, gentile, bellini, from, venice, to, paint, his, portrait, as, well, as, venetian, frescoes, that, are, vanished, today, he, collected, in, his, palace, a, library, that, included, works, in, greek, persian, and, latin, mehmed, invited, muslim, scientists, and, astronomers, such, as, ali, qushji, and, artists, to, his, court, in, constantinople, started, a, university, and, built, mosques, for, example, the, fatih, mosque, waterways, and, istanbul, s, topkap, palace, and, the, tiled, kiosk, around, the, grand, mosque, that, he, constructed, he, erected, eight, madrasas, which, for, nearly, a, century, kept, their, rank, as, the, highest, teaching, institutions, of, the, islamic, sciences, in, the, empire, mehmed, ii, allowed, his, subjects, a, considerable, degree, of, religious, freedom, provided, they, were, obedient, to, his, rule, after, his, conquest, of, bosnia, in, 1463, he, issued, the, ahdname, of, milodra, to, the, bosnian, franciscans, granting, them, the, freedom, to, move, freely, within, the, empire, offer, worship, in, their, churches, and, monasteries, and, practice, their, religion, free, from, official, and, unofficial, persecution, insult, or, disturbance, however, his, standing, army, was, recruited, from, the, devshirme, a, group, that, took, christian, subjects, at, a, young, age, 8, 20, yrs, they, were, converted, to, islam, then, schooled, for, administration, or, the, military, janissaries, this, was, a, meritocracy, which, produced, from, among, their, alumni, four, out, of, five, grand, viziers, from, this, time, on, within, constantinople, mehmed, established, a, millet, or, an, autonomous, religious, community, and, appointed, the, former, patriarch, gennadius, scholarius, as, religious, leader, for, the, orthodox, christians, of, the, city, his, authority, extended, to, all, ottoman, orthodox, christians, and, this, excluded, the, genoese, and, venetian, settlements, in, the, suburbs, and, excluded, muslim, and, jewish, settlers, entirely, this, method, allowed, for, an, indirect, rule, of, the, christian, byzantines, and, allowed, the, occupants, to, feel, relatively, autonomous, even, as, mehmed, ii, began, the, turkish, remodeling, of, the, city, turning, it, into, the, turkish, capital, which, it, remained, until, the, 1920s, mehmed, the, conqueror, consolidated, power, by, building, his, imperial, court, the, divan, with, officials, who, would, be, solely, loyal, to, him, and, allow, him, greater, autonomy, and, authority, under, previous, sultans, the, divan, had, been, filled, with, members, of, aristocratic, families, that, sometimes, had, other, interests, and, loyalties, than, that, of, the, sultan, mehmed, the, conqueror, transitioned, the, empire, away, from, the, ghazi, mentality, that, emphasizes, ancient, traditions, and, ceremonies, in, governance, and, moved, it, towards, a, centralized, bureaucracy, largely, made, of, officials, of, dev, irme, background, additionally, mehmed, the, conqueror, took, the, step, of, converting, the, religious, scholars, who, were, part, of, the, ottoman, madrasas, into, salaried, employees, of, the, ottoman, bureaucracy, who, were, loyal, to, him, this, centralization, was, possible, and, formalized, through, a, kanunname, issued, during, 1477, 1481, which, for, the, first, time, listed, the, chief, officials, in, the, ottoman, government, their, roles, and, responsibilities, salaries, protocol, and, punishments, as, well, as, how, they, related, to, each, other, and, the, sultan, once, mehmed, had, created, an, ottoman, bureaucracy, and, transformed, the, empire, from, a, frontier, society, to, a, centralized, government, he, took, care, to, appoint, officials, who, would, help, him, implement, his, agenda, his, first, grand, vizier, was, zaganos, pasha, who, was, of, dev, irme, background, as, opposed, to, an, aristocrat, and, zaganos, pasha, s, successor, mahmud, pasha, angelovi, was, also, of, dev, irme, background, mehmed, was, the, first, sultan, who, was, able, to, codify, and, implement, kanunname, solely, based, on, his, own, independent, authority, additionally, mehmed, was, able, to, later, implement, kanunname, that, went, against, previous, tradition, or, precedent, this, was, monumental, in, an, empire, that, was, so, steeped, in, tradition, and, could, be, slow, to, change, or, adapt, having, viziers, and, other, officials, who, were, loyal, to, mehmed, was, an, essential, part, of, this, government, because, he, transferred, more, power, to, the, viziers, than, previous, sultans, had, he, delegated, significant, powers, and, functions, of, government, to, his, viziers, as, part, of, his, new, policy, of, imperial, seclusions, a, wall, was, built, around, the, palace, as, an, element, of, the, more, closed, era, and, unlike, previous, sultans, mehmed, was, no, longer, accessible, to, the, public, or, even, lower, officials, his, viziers, directed, the, military, and, met, foreign, ambassadors, two, essential, parts, of, governing, especially, with, his, numerous, military, campaigns, one, such, notable, ambassador, was, kinsman, karab, cu, pasha, turkish, karab, c, kuzen, pa, a, who, came, from, a, rooted, family, of, spies, which, enabled, him, to, play, a, notable, role, in, mehmed, s, campaign, of, conquering, constantinople, aside, from, his, efforts, to, expand, ottoman, dominion, throughout, the, eastern, mediterranean, mehmed, ii, also, cultivated, a, large, collection, of, western, art, and, literature, many, of, which, were, produced, by, renaissance, artists, from, a, young, age, mehmed, had, shown, interest, in, renaissance, art, and, classical, literature, and, histories, with, his, school, books, having, caricaturistic, illustrations, of, ancient, coins, and, portraiture, sketched, in, distinctly, european, styles, furthermore, he, reportedly, had, two, tutors, one, trained, in, greek, and, another, in, latin, who, read, him, classical, histories, including, those, of, laertius, livy, and, herodotus, in, the, days, leading, up, to, the, fall, of, constantinople, from, early, on, in, his, reign, mehmed, invested, in, the, patronage, of, italian, renaissance, artists, his, first, documented, request, in, 1461, was, a, commission, from, artist, matteo, de, pasti, who, resided, in, the, court, of, the, lord, of, rimini, sigismondo, malatesta, this, first, attempt, was, unsuccessful, though, as, pasti, was, arrested, in, crete, by, venetian, authorities, accusing, him, of, being, an, ottoman, spy, later, attempts, would, prove, more, fruitful, with, some, notable, artists, including, costanzo, da, ferrara, and, gentile, bellini, both, being, invited, to, the, ottoman, court, aside, from, his, patronage, of, renaissance, artists, mehmed, was, also, an, avid, scholar, of, contemporary, and, classical, literature, and, history, this, interest, culminated, in, mehmed, s, work, on, building, a, massive, multilingual, library, that, contained, over, 8000, manuscripts, in, persian, ottoman, turkish, arabic, latin, and, greek, among, other, languages, of, note, in, this, large, collection, was, mehmed, s, greek, scriptorium, which, included, copies, of, arrians, anabasis, of, alexander, the, great, and, homer, s, iliad, his, interest, in, classical, works, extended, in, many, directions, including, the, patronage, of, the, greek, writer, kritiboulos, of, imbros, who, produced, the, greek, manuscript, history, of, mehmed, the, conqueror, alongside, his, efforts, to, salvage, and, rebind, greek, manuscripts, acquired, after, his, conquest, of, constantinople, historians, believe, that, mehmed, s, widespread, cultural, and, artistic, tastes, especially, those, aimed, towards, the, west, served, various, important, diplomatic, and, administrative, functions, his, patronage, of, renaissance, artists, have, been, interpreted, as, a, method, of, diplomacy, with, other, influential, mediterranean, states, significantly, many, italian, states, including, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, the, republic, of, florence, furthermore, historians, speculate, that, his, greek, scriptorium, was, used, to, educate, greek, chancellery, officials, in, an, attempt, to, reintegrate, former, byzantine, diplomatic, channels, with, several, italian, states, that, conducted, their, correspondences, in, greek, importantly, historians, also, assert, that, mehmed, s, vast, collection, of, art, and, literature, worked, towards, promoting, his, imperial, authority, and, legitimacy, especially, in, his, newly, conquered, lands, this, was, accomplished, through, various, means, including, the, invocation, of, mehmed, s, image, as, an, oriental, neo, alexandrian, figure, which, is, seen, through, shared, helmet, ornaments, in, depictions, of, mehmed, and, alexander, on, medallion, portraits, produced, during, mehmed, s, reign, as, well, as, being, a, leitmotiv, in, kritiboulous, work, additionally, his, commissioning, of, renaissance, artwork, was, itself, possibly, an, attempt, to, break, down, western, oriental, cultural, binaries, in, order, for, mehmed, to, present, himself, as, a, western, oriented, ruler, among, the, ranks, of, contemporary, european, christian, monarchs, mehmed, s, affinity, towards, the, renaissance, arts, and, his, strong, initiative, in, its, creation, and, collection, did, not, have, a, large, base, of, support, within, his, own, court, one, of, the, many, opponents, to, mehmed, s, collection, was, his, own, son, and, future, sultan, bayezid, ii, who, was, backed, by, powerful, religious, and, turkish, factions, in, his, opposition, upon, his, accession, bayezid, ii, sold, mehmed, s, collection, of, portraits, and, disposed, of, his, statuary, mehmed, ii, had, at, least, eight, known, consorts, at, least, one, of, whom, was, his, legal, wife, mehmed, ii, was, the, last, sultan, to, legally, marry, until, 1533, 1534, when, suleiman, the, magnificent, married, his, favorite, concubine, h, rrem, sultan, mehmed, ii, s, eight, known, consorts, are, mehmed, ii, had, at, least, four, sons, mehmed, ii, had, at, least, four, daughters, mehmed, had, a, strong, interest, in, ancient, greek, and, medieval, byzantine, civilization, his, heroes, were, achilles, and, alexander, the, great, and, he, could, discuss, christian, religion, with, some, authority, he, was, reputed, to, be, fluent, in, several, languages, including, turkish, serbian, arabic, persian, greek, and, latin, at, times, he, assembled, the, ulama, or, learned, muslim, teachers, and, caused, them, to, discuss, theological, problems, in, his, presence, during, his, reign, mathematics, astronomy, and, theology, reached, their, highest, level, among, the, ottomans, his, social, circle, included, a, number, of, humanists, and, sages, such, as, ciriaco, de, pizzicolli, of, ancona, benedetto, dei, of, florence, and, michael, critobulus, of, imbros, who, mentions, mehmed, as, a, philhellene, thanks, to, his, interest, in, grecian, antiquities, and, relics, it, was, on, his, orders, that, the, parthenon, and, other, athenian, monuments, were, spared, destruction, besides, mehmed, ii, himself, was, a, poet, writing, under, the, name, avni, the, helper, the, helpful, one, and, he, left, a, classical, diwan, poetry, collection, some, sources, claim, that, mehmed, had, a, passion, for, his, hostage, and, favourite, radu, the, fair, young, men, condemned, to, death, were, spared, and, added, to, mehmed, s, seraglio, if, he, found, them, attractive, and, the, porte, went, to, great, lengths, to, procure, young, noblemen, for, him, in, 1481, mehmed, marched, with, the, ottoman, army, but, upon, reaching, maltepe, istanbul, he, became, ill, he, was, just, beginning, new, campaigns, to, capture, rhodes, and, southern, italy, however, according, to, some, historians, his, next, voyage, was, planned, to, overthrow, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, egypt, and, to, capture, egypt, and, claim, the, caliphate, but, after, some, days, he, died, on, 3, may, 1481, at, the, age, of, forty, nine, and, was, buried, in, his, t, rbe, near, the, fatih, mosque, complex, according, to, the, historian, colin, heywood, there, is, substantial, circumstantial, evidence, that, mehmed, was, poisoned, possibly, at, the, behest, of, his, eldest, son, and, successor, bayezid, the, news, of, mehmed, s, death, caused, great, rejoicing, in, europe, church, bells, were, rung, and, celebrations, held, the, news, was, proclaimed, in, venice, thus, la, grande, aquila, morta, the, great, eagle, is, dead, mehmed, ii, is, recognized, as, the, first, sultan, to, codify, criminal, and, constitutional, law, long, before, suleiman, the, magnificent, he, thus, established, the, classical, image, of, the, autocratic, ottoman, sultan, mehmed, s, thirty, year, rule, and, numerous, wars, expanded, the, ottoman, empire, to, include, constantinople, the, turkish, kingdoms, and, territories, of, asia, minor, bosnia, serbia, and, albania, mehmed, left, behind, an, imposing, reputation, in, both, the, islamic, and, christian, worlds, according, to, historian, franz, babinger, mehmed, was, regarded, as, a, bloodthirsty, tyrant, by, the, christian, world, and, by, a, part, of, his, subjects, istanbul, s, fatih, sultan, mehmet, bridge, completed, 1988, which, crosses, the, bosporus, straits, is, named, after, him, and, his, name, and, picture, appeared, on, the, turkish, 1000, lira, note, from, 1986, to, 1992
