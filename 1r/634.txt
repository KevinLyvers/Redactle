worked, without, interruption, as, having, made, him, the, greatest, actor, director, in, the, history, of, the, movies, in, 1996, entertainment, weekly, recognized, keaton, as, the, seventh, greatest, film, director, stating, that, his, films, offer, belly, laughs, of, mind, boggling, physical, invention, and, a, spacey, determination, that, nears, philosophical, grandeur, in, 1999, the, american, film, institute, ranked, him, as, the, 21st, greatest, male, star, of, classic, hollywood, cinema, keaton, was, born, into, a, vaudeville, family, in, piqua, kansas, the, small, town, which, his, mother, myra, keaton, n, e, cutler, was, visiting, at, the, time, he, was, named, joseph, to, continue, a, tradition, on, his, father, s, side, he, was, sixth, in, a, line, bearing, the, name,

mohawk, indian, medicine, company, which, performed, on, stage, and, sold, patent, medicine, on, the, side, according, to, a, frequently, repeated, story, which, may, be, apocryphal, keaton, acquired, the, nickname, buster, at, the, age, of, 18, months, after, the, child, fell, down, a, long, flight, of, stairs, without, injury, an, actor, friend, named, george, pardey, remarked, gee, whiz, he, s, a, regular, buster, 17, after, this, keaton, s, father, began, to, use, the, nickname, to, refer, to, the, youngster, keaton, retold, the, anecdote, over, the, years, including, in, a, 1964, interview, with, the, cbc, s, telescope, in, keaton, s, retelling, he, was, six, months, old, when, the, incident, occurred, and, harry, houdini, gave, him, the, nickname, though, the, family, did, not, get, to, know, houdini, until, later, 18, at, the, age, of, three, keaton, began, performing, with, his, parents, in, the, three, keatons, he, first, appeared, on, stage, in, 1899, in, wilmington, delaware, the, act, was, mainly, a, comedy, sketch, myra, played, the, saxophone, to, one, side, while, joe, and, keaton, performed, center, stage, both, wearing, slapsoles, bald, headed, wigs, and, irish, beards, the, young, keaton, goaded, his, father, by, disobeying, him, and, the, elder, keaton, responded, by, throwing, him, against, the, scenery, into, the, orchestra, pit, or, even, into, the, audience, a, suitcase, handle, was, sewn, into, keaton, s, clothing, to, aid, with, the, constant, tossing, the, act, evolved, as, keaton, learned, to, take, trick, falls, safely, he, was, rarely, injured, or, bruised, on, stage, this, knockabout, style, of, comedy, led, to, accusations, of, child, abuse, and, occasionally, arrest, however, keaton, was, always, able, to, show, the, authorities, that, he, had, no, bruises, or, broken, bones, he, was, eventually, billed, as, the, little, boy, who, can, t, be, damaged, and, the, overall, act, as, the, roughest, act, that, was, ever, in, the, history, of, the, stage, decades, later, keaton, said, that, he, was, never, hurt, by, his, father, and, that, the, falls, and, physical, comedy, were, a, matter, of, proper, technical, execution, in, 1914, he, told, the, detroit, news, the, secret, is, in, landing, limp, and, breaking, the, fall, with, a, foot, or, a, hand, it, s, a, knack, i, started, so, young, that, landing, right, is, second, nature, with, me, several, times, i, d, have, been, killed, if, i, hadn, t, been, able, to, land, like, a, cat, imitators, of, our, act, don, t, last, long, because, they, can, t, stand, the, treatment, keaton, said, he, had, so, much, fun, that, he, sometimes, began, laughing, as, his, father, threw, him, across, the, stage, noticing, that, this, caused, the, audience, to, laugh, less, he, adopted, his, famous, deadpan, expression, when, performing, the, act, ran, up, against, laws, banning, child, performers, in, vaudeville, according, to, one, biographer, keaton, was, made, to, go, to, school, while, performing, in, new, york, but, only, attended, for, part, of, one, day, despite, tangles, with, the, law, keaton, was, a, rising, and, relatively, well, paid, star, in, the, theater, he, stated, that, he, learned, to, read, and, write, late, and, was, taught, by, his, mother, by, the, time, he, was, 21, his, father, s, alcoholism, threatened, the, reputation, of, the, family, act, so, keaton, and, his, mother, myra, left, for, new, york, where, keaton, s, career, quickly, moved, from, vaudeville, to, film, keaton, served, in, the, american, expeditionary, forces, in, france, with, the, united, states, army, s, 40th, infantry, division, during, world, war, i, his, unit, remained, intact, and, was, not, broken, up, to, provide, replacements, as, happened, to, some, other, late, arriving, divisions, during, his, time, in, uniform, he, developed, an, ear, infection, that, permanently, impaired, his, hearing, keaton, spent, the, summers, of, 1908, 1916, at, the, actor, s, colony, in, the, bluffton, neighborhood, of, muskegon, along, with, other, famous, vaudevillians, in, february, 1917, he, met, roscoe, fatty, arbuckle, at, the, talmadge, studios, in, new, york, city, where, arbuckle, was, under, contract, to, joseph, m, schenck, joe, keaton, disapproved, of, films, and, keaton, also, had, reservations, about, the, medium, during, his, first, meeting, with, arbuckle, he, was, asked, to, jump, in, and, start, acting, keaton, was, such, a, natural, in, his, first, film, the, butcher, boy, he, was, hired, on, the, spot, at, the, end, of, the, day, he, asked, to, borrow, one, of, the, cameras, to, get, a, feel, for, how, it, worked, he, took, the, camera, back, to, his, hotel, room, where, he, dismantled, and, reassembled, it, by, morning, keaton, later, said, that, he, was, soon, arbuckle, s, second, director, and, his, entire, gag, department, he, appeared, in, a, total, of, 14, arbuckle, shorts, running, into, 1920, they, were, popular, and, contrary, to, keaton, s, later, reputation, as, the, great, stone, face, he, often, smiled, and, even, laughed, in, them, keaton, and, arbuckle, became, close, friends, and, keaton, was, one, of, few, people, along, with, charlie, chaplin, to, defend, arbuckle, s, character, during, accusations, that, he, was, responsible, for, the, death, of, actress, virginia, rappe, arbuckle, was, eventually, acquitted, with, an, apology, from, the, jury, for, the, ordeal, he, underwent, in, 1920, the, saphead, was, released, in, which, keaton, had, his, first, starring, role, in, a, full, length, feature, it, was, based, on, a, successful, play, the, new, henrietta, which, had, already, been, filmed, once, under, the, title, the, lamb, with, douglas, fairbanks, playing, the, lead, after, keaton, s, successful, work, with, arbuckle, schenck, gave, him, his, own, production, unit, buster, keaton, productions, he, made, a, series, of, 19, two, reel, comedies, including, one, week, 1920, the, playhouse, 1921, cops, 1922, and, the, electric, house, 1922, keaton, then, moved, to, full, length, features, keaton, s, writers, included, clyde, bruckman, joseph, mitchell, and, jean, havez, but, the, most, ingenious, gags, were, generally, conceived, by, keaton, himself, comedy, director, leo, mccarey, recalling, the, freewheeling, days, of, making, slapstick, comedies, said, all, of, us, tried, to, steal, each, other, s, gagmen, but, we, had, no, luck, with, keaton, because, he, thought, up, his, best, gags, himself, and, we, couldn, t, steal, him, the, more, adventurous, ideas, called, for, dangerous, stunts, performed, by, keaton, at, great, physical, risk, during, the, railroad, water, tank, scene, in, sherlock, jr, gags, written, by, clyde, bruckman, keaton, broke, his, neck, when, a, torrent, of, water, fell, on, him, from, a, water, tower, but, he, did, not, realize, it, until, years, afterwards, a, scene, from, steamboat, bill, jr, required, keaton, to, stand, still, on, a, particular, spot, then, the, facade, of, a, two, story, building, toppled, forward, on, top, of, keaton, keaton, s, character, emerged, unscathed, due, to, a, single, open, window, the, stunt, required, precision, because, the, prop, house, weighed, two, tons, and, the, window, only, offered, a, few, inches, of, clearance, around, keaton, s, body, the, sequence, furnished, one, of, the, most, memorable, images, of, his, career, aside, from, steamboat, bill, jr, 1928, keaton, s, most, enduring, feature, length, films, include, three, ages, 1923, our, hospitality, 1923, the, navigator, 1924, sherlock, jr, 1924, seven, chances, 1925, the, cameraman, 1928, and, the, general, 1926, the, general, set, during, the, american, civil, war, combined, physical, comedy, with, keaton, s, love, of, trains, including, an, epic, locomotive, chase, employing, picturesque, locations, the, film, s, storyline, reenacted, an, actual, wartime, incident, though, it, would, come, to, be, regarded, as, keaton, s, greatest, achievement, the, film, received, mixed, reviews, at, the, time, it, was, too, dramatic, for, some, filmgoers, expecting, a, lightweight, comedy, and, reviewers, questioned, keaton, s, judgment, in, making, a, comedic, film, about, the, civil, war, even, while, noting, it, had, a, few, laughs, it, was, an, expensive, misfire, the, climactic, scene, of, a, locomotive, plummeting, through, a, burning, bridge, was, the, most, expensive, single, shot, in, silent, film, history, and, keaton, was, never, entrusted, with, total, control, over, his, films, again, his, distributor, united, artists, insisted, on, a, production, manager, who, monitored, expenses, and, interfered, with, certain, story, elements, keaton, endured, this, treatment, for, two, more, feature, films, and, then, exchanged, his, independent, setup, for, employment, at, hollywood, s, biggest, studio, metro, goldwyn, mayer, mgm, keaton, s, loss, of, independence, as, a, filmmaker, coincided, with, the, coming, of, sound, films, although, he, was, interested, in, making, the, transition, and, mounting, personal, problems, and, his, career, in, the, early, sound, era, was, hurt, as, a, result, keaton, s, last, three, features, had, been, produced, and, released, independently, under, keaton, s, control, and, fell, short, of, financial, expectations, at, the, box, office, in, 1928, film, executive, nicholas, schenck, arranged, a, deal, with, metro, goldwyn, mayer, for, keaton, s, services, keaton, had, little, to, say, about, the, details, of, the, mgm, contract, he, would, no, longer, have, any, financial, responsibility, for, his, films, and, even, his, salary, had, been, pre, negotiated, without, his, own, input, charlie, chaplin, and, harold, lloyd, advised, him, against, making, the, move, cautioning, that, he, would, lose, his, independence, but, given, schenck, s, desire, to, keep, things, in, the, family, and, keaton, s, having, to, admit, that, his, independent, pictures, hadn, t, done, well, keaton, agreed, to, sign, with, mgm, he, would, later, cite, this, as, the, worst, business, decision, of, his, life, in, his, autobiography, welcomed, to, the, studio, by, irving, thalberg, with, whom, he, initially, had, a, relationship, of, mutual, admiration, keaton, realized, too, late, that, the, studio, system, mgm, represented, would, severely, limit, his, creative, input, the, giant, studio, was, run, along, strict, factory, lines, with, everything, planned, and, budgeted, in, advance, the, first, of, mgm, s, keaton, films, was, the, cameraman, 1928, and, keaton, sensed, trouble, immediately, when, he, saw, the, script, it, was, as, long, as, war, and, peace, keaton, recalled, i, took, out, 40, useless, characters, and, a, couple, of, subplots, these, guys, didn, t, realize, they, still, don, t, realize, that, the, best, comedies, are, simple, i, said, i, d, like, to, do, something, with, a, drunk, and, a, fat, lady, and, a, kid, get, em, for, me, at, my, studio, they, would, have, the, characters, i, wanted, in, 10, minutes, but, not, mgm, you, had, to, requisition, a, toothpick, in, triplicate, i, just, stood, there, and, everybody, is, hassling, mgm, wanted, only, keaton, the, star, keaton, the, creator, was, considered, a, waste, of, time, and, money, because, in, the, time, it, took, him, to, develop, a, project, he, could, have, appeared, in, two, or, three, pictures, set, up, by, the, studio, s, production, staff, when, the, studio, began, making, talking, films, keaton, was, enthused, about, the, new, technology, and, wanted, to, make, his, next, film, spite, marriage, with, sound, mgm, refused, because, the, film, was, more, valuable, in, silent, form, it, could, be, shown, around, the, world, in, theaters, that, had, not, converted, to, sound, also, soundstages, were, then, at, a, premium, and, mgm, usually, reserved, them, for, dramatic, productions, mgm, also, forced, keaton, to, use, a, stunt, double, during, some, of, the, more, dangerous, scenes, to, protect, its, investment, something, he, had, never, done, in, his, heyday, stuntmen, don, t, get, you, laughs, keaton, had, said, in, the, first, keaton, pictures, with, sound, he, and, his, fellow, actors, would, shoot, each, scene, three, times, once, in, english, once, in, spanish, and, once, in, either, french, or, german, the, actors, would, phonetically, memorize, the, foreign, language, scripts, a, few, lines, at, a, time, and, shoot, immediately, after, this, is, discussed, in, the, tcm, documentary, buster, keaton, so, funny, it, hurt, with, keaton, complaining, about, having, to, shoot, lousy, films, not, just, once, but, three, times, keaton, kept, trying, to, persuade, his, bosses, to, let, him, do, things, his, way, production, head, irving, thalberg, would, not, permit, keaton, to, create, a, script, from, scratch, because, the, studio, had, already, purchased, a, stage, property, dating, from, 1917, parlor, bedroom, and, bath, at, the, suggestion, of, lawrence, weingarten, who, was, thalberg, s, brother, in, law, and, keaton, s, producer, we, were, desperate, we, didn, t, know, what, to, do, recalled, weingarten, however, thalberg, did, allow, keaton, to, stage, the, gags, including, long, stretches, of, pantomime, and, agreed, to, send, a, crew, to, keaton, s, own, mansion, for, exterior, shots, keaton, s, relative, freedom, during, this, project, resulted, in, a, better, than, usual, film, apart, from, its, exceptional, quality, writes, biographer, james, curtis, the, big, takeaway, from, parlor, bedroom, and, bath, was, its, extraordinary, commercial, success, performing, better, at, the, box, office, than, any, of, keaton, s, other, mgm, talkies, it, pulled, in, worldwide, rentals, of, 985, 000, with, a, yield, of, 299, 000, it, became, the, most, profitable, of, all, of, buster, keaton, s, features, silent, or, sound, curtis, notes, that, it, was, also, the, only, one, of, his, mgm, features, that, came, in, under, budget, and, ahead, of, schedule, the, next, project, confirmed, keaton, s, fears, about, studio, interference, he, was, handed, a, script, titled, sidewalks, of, new, york, 1932, in, which, he, played, a, millionaire, becoming, involved, with, a, slum, neighborhood, girl, and, a, gang, of, rowdy, kids, keaton, thought, the, premise, was, totally, unsuitable, and, was, uncomfortable, with, his, directors, jules, white, and, zion, myers, who, emphasized, blunt, slapstick, i, went, over, weingarten, s, head, and, appealed, to, irving, thalberg, to, help, get, me, out, of, the, assignment, irving, was, usually, on, my, side, but, this, time, he, said, larry, likes, it, everybody, else, in, the, studio, likes, the, story, you, are, the, only, one, who, doesn, t, in, the, end, i, gave, up, like, a, fool, and, said, what, the, hell, who, was, i, to, say, i, was, right, and, everyone, was, wrong, the, film, s, emphasis, on, obvious, slapstick, made, it, unsuitable, for, the, usual, prestigious, broadway, premiere, it, opened, simultaneously, in, two, new, york, side, street, theaters, but, the, less, discriminating, audiences, in, small, towns, across, america, flocked, to, the, film, resulting, in, an, ultimate, success, mgm, had, been, featuring, comical, musician, cliff, edwards, in, keaton, s, films, the, studio, replaced, edwards, who, had, substance, abuse, problems, with, nightclub, comedian, jimmy, durante, the, laconic, keaton, and, the, rambunctious, durante, offered, enough, contrast, to, function, as, a, team, resulting, in, three, very, successful, films, speak, easily, 1932, the, passionate, plumber, 1932, and, what, no, beer, 1933, behind, the, scenes, there, was, trouble, in, march, 1932, studio, chief, louis, b, mayer, s, office, requested, keaton, to, report, for, work, on, a, saturday, afternoon, to, go, through, the, motions, of, filming, a, scene, for, studio, visitors, keaton, already, had, plans, to, attend, a, local, college, baseball, championship, where, he, was, to, be, the, home, team, mascot, he, sent, his, regrets, to, mayer, s, office, and, kept, his, date, at, the, ball, game, only, to, receive, a, warning, from, mayer, the, following, tuesday, suspending, his, pay, until, he, resumed, working, keaton, s, behavior, had, become, erratic, by, 1932, despondent, over, working, conditions, at, the, studio, and, over, his, wife, s, antagonism, toward, him, at, home, this, affected, his, films, he, was, sometimes, visibly, intoxicated, on, and, off, camera, i, got, to, the, stage, where, i, didn, t, give, a, darn, whether, school, kept, or, not, and, then, i, started, drinking, too, much, keaton, told, interviewer, tony, thomas, when, i, found, out, that, they, could, write, stories, and, material, better, than, i, could, anyway, what, was, the, use, of, my, fighting, with, them, the, demoralized, keaton, couldn, t, turn, to, production, chief, irving, thalberg, for, support, because, thalberg, was, then, on, a, medical, leave, that, lasted, eight, months, this, left, louis, b, mayer, temporarily, in, sole, charge, of, the, studio, which, made, keaton, s, standing, at, mgm, even, more, fragile, keaton, s, absences, were, costing, the, company, 3, 000, a, day, 63, 030, in, 2024, the, last, straw, came, when, mayer, raided, keaton, s, dressing, room, during, a, wild, party, with, keaton, s, cronies, and, their, girlfriends, mgm, staffer, sam, marx, remembered, the, outcome, buster, ordered, him, out, of, the, trailer, and, mayer, ordered, him, out, of, the, studio, mayer, couldn, t, oust, him, immediately, because, keaton, s, latest, picture, wasn, t, yet, finished, immediately, after, keaton, completed, retakes, on, what, no, beer, he, was, fired, for, good, and, sufficient, cause, in, a, letter, signed, by, mayer, on, february, 2, 1933, keaton, had, been, considered, to, appear, in, the, studio, s, all, star, success, grand, hotel, only, to, have, his, role, of, the, consumptive, kringelein, taken, by, lionel, barrymore, as, what, no, beer, was, nearing, completion, keaton, sober, shaved, and, calm, as, keaton, told, his, biographer, rudi, blesh, pitched, an, idea, to, irving, thalberg, he, wanted, to, make, a, feature, length, parody, of, grand, hotel, with, an, all, comedy, cast, himself, in, the, lionel, barrymore, role, jimmy, durante, in, the, john, barrymore, role, marie, dressler, in, the, greta, garbo, role, polly, moran, in, the, joan, crawford, role, henry, armetta, in, the, jean, hersholt, role, edward, everett, horton, in, the, lewis, stone, role, and, laurel, and, hardy, sharing, the, wallace, beery, role, edward, sedgwick, would, be, directing, keaton, called, his, version, grand, mills, hotel, after, the, mills, hotel, a, bowery, flophouse, thalberg, was, hesitant, about, burlesquing, the, dignified, studio, s, own, work, but, seeing, keaton, s, obvious, disappointment, said, he, d, think, about, it, after, louis, b, mayer, had, fired, keaton, thalberg, returned, to, the, studio, and, persuaded, mayer, that, keaton, was, still, valuable, to, the, company, thalberg, tried, to, resurrect, keaton, s, mgm, career, by, offering, to, go, ahead, with, the, grand, hotel, satire, now, retitled, gland, hotel, keaton, still, furious, at, mayer, refused, to, return, to, the, studio, and, mayer, was, not, about, to, apologize, so, ended, buster, keaton, s, starring, career, in, feature, films, in, 1934, keaton, accepted, an, offer, to, make, an, independent, film, in, paris, le, roi, des, champs, lys, es, it, was, not, released, in, the, united, states, during, this, period, he, made, another, film, in, england, the, invader, no, hollywood, studio, would, release, the, film, and, it, was, finally, released, in, 1936, as, an, old, spanish, custom, by, a, small, film, import, firm, based, in, new, york, upon, keaton, s, return, to, hollywood, in, 1934, he, made, a, screen, comeback, in, two, reel, comedies, for, educational, pictures, most, of, these, 20, minute, shorts, are, simple, visual, comedies, with, many, of, the, gags, supplied, by, keaton, himself, often, recycling, ideas, from, his, family, vaudeville, act, and, his, earlier, films, keaton, had, a, free, hand, in, staging, the, films, within, the, studio, s, budgetary, limits, and, using, its, staff, writers, the, educational, two, reelers, have, far, more, pantomime, than, his, earlier, talkies, and, keaton, is, in, good, form, throughout, the, high, point, in, the, educational, series, is, grand, slam, opera, 1936, featuring, keaton, in, his, own, screenplay, as, an, amateur, hour, contestant, the, educational, series, was, very, well, received, by, theater, owners, and, movie, audiences, and, keaton, was, the, studio, s, most, important, comedian, he, was, also, its, most, expensive, comedian, earning, 2,

completing, it, keaton, started, experimenting, with, parody, during, his, vaudeville, years, where, most, frequently, his, performances, involved, impressions, and, burlesques, of, other, performers, acts, most, of, these, parodies, targeted, acts, with, which, keaton, had, shared, the, bill, when, keaton, transposed, his, experience, in, vaudeville, to, film, in, many, works, he, parodied, melodramas, other, favorite, targets, were, cinematic, plots, structures, and, devices, one, of, his, most, biting, parodies, is, the, frozen, north, 1922, a, satirical, take, on, william, s, hart, s, western, melodramas, like, hell, s, hinges, 1916, and, the, narrow, trail, 1917, keaton, parodied, the, tired, formula, of, the, melodramatic, transformation, from, bad, guy, to, good, guy, which, hart, s, characters, went, through, known, as, the, good, badman, he, wears, a, small, version, of, hart, s, campaign, hat, from, the, spanish, american, war, and, a, six, shooter, on, each, thigh, and, during, the, scene, in, which, he, shoots, the, neighbor, and, her, husband, he, reacts, with, thick, glycerin, tears, a, trademark, of, hart, s, audiences, of, the, 1920s, recognized, the, parody, and, thought, the, film, hysterically, funny, however, hart, himself, was, not, amused, by, keaton, s, antics, particularly, the, crying, scene, and, did, not, speak, to, keaton, for, two, years, after, he, had, seen, the, film, the, film, s, opening, intertitles, give, it, its, mock, serious, tone, and, are, taken, from, the, shooting, of, dan, mcgrew, by, robert, w, service, in, the, playhouse, 1921, he, parodied, his, contemporary, thomas, h, ince, hart, s, producer, who, indulged, in, over, crediting, himself, in, his, film, productions, the, short, also, featured, the, impression, of, a, performing, monkey, which, was, likely, derived, from, a, co, biller, s, act, called, peter, the, great, three, ages, 1923, his, first, feature, length, film, is, a, parody, of, d, w, griffith, s, intolerance, 1916, from, which, it, replicates, the, three, inter, cut, shorts, structure, three, ages, also, featured, parodies, of, bible, stories, like, those, of, samson, and, daniel, keaton, directed, the, film, along, with, edward, f, cline, by, this, time, keaton, had, further, developed, his, distinct, signature, style, that, consisted, of, lucidity, and, precision, along, with, acrobatics, of, ballistic, precision, and, kineticism, critic, and, film, historian, imogen, sara, smith, stated, about, keaton, s, style, the, coolness, and, subtlety, of, his, style, very, cinematic, in, terms, of, recognising, that, the, camera, can, pick, up, very, very, small, effects, film, critic, david, thomson, later, described, keaton, s, style, of, comedy, buster, plainly, is, a, man, inclined, towards, a, belief, in, nothing, but, mathematics, and, absurdity, like, a, number, that, has, always, been, searching, for, the, right, equation, look, at, his, face, as, beautiful, but, as, inhuman, as, a, butterfly, and, you, see, that, utter, failure, to, identify, sentiment, gilberto, perez, commented, on, keaton, s, genius, as, an, actor, to, keep, a, face, so, nearly, deadpan, and, yet, render, it, by, subtle, inflections, so, vividly, expressive, of, inner, life, his, large, deep, eyes, are, the, most, eloquent, feature, with, merely, a, stare, he, can, convey, a, wide, range, of, emotions, from, longing, to, mistrust, from, puzzlement, to, sorrow, critic, anthony, lane, also, noted, keaton, s, body, language, the, traditional, buster, stance, requires, that, he, remain, upstanding, full, of, backbone, looking, ahead, he, clambers, onto, the, roof, of, his, locomotive, and, leans, gently, forward, to, scan, the, terrain, with, the, breeze, in, his, hair, and, adventure, zipping, toward, him, around, the, next, bend, it, is, the, angle, that, you, remember, the, figure, perfectly, straight, but, tilted, forward, like, the, spirit, of, ecstasy, on, the, hood, of, a, rolls, royce, he, drives, a, low, grade, automobile, over, a, bump, in, the, road, and, the, car, just, crumbles, beneath, him, rerun, it, on, video, and, you, can, see, buster, riding, the, collapse, like, a, surfer, hanging, onto, the, steering, wheel, coming, beautifully, to, rest, as, the, wave, of, wreckage, breaks, film, historian, jeffrey, vance, wrote, buster, keaton, s, comedy, endures, not, just, because, he, had, a, face, that, belongs, on, mount, rushmore, at, once, hauntingly, immovable, and, classically, american, but, because, that, face, was, attached, to, one, of, the, most, gifted, actors, and, directors, who, ever, graced, the, screen, evolved, from, the, knockabout, upbringing, of, the, vaudeville, stage, keaton, s, comedy, is, a, whirlwind, of, hilarious, technically, precise, adroitly, executed, and, surprising, gags, very, often, set, against, a, backdrop, of, visually, stunning, set, pieces, and, locations, all, this, masked, behind, his, unflinching, stoic, veneer, keaton, designed, and, modified, his, own, pork, pie, hats, during, his, career, in, 1964, he, told, an, interviewer, that, in, making, this, particular, pork, pie, he, started, with, a, good, stetson, and, cut, it, down, stiffening, the, brim, with, sugar, water, the, hats, were, often, destroyed, during, keaton, s, wild, film, antics, some, were, given, away, as, gifts, and, some, were, snatched, by, souvenir, hunters, keaton, said, he, was, lucky, if, he, used, only, six, hats, in, making, a, film, he, estimated, that, he, and, his, wife, eleanor, made, thousands, of, hats, during, his, career, keaton, observed, that, during, his, silent, period, such, a, hat, cost, him, around, two, dollars, 27, 33, in, 2022, dollars, at, the, time, of, his, interview, he, said, they, cost, almost, 13, 116, in, 2022, dollars, on, may, 31, 1921, keaton, married, natalie, talmadge, his, leading, lady, in, our, hospitality, and, the, sister, of, actresses, norma, talmadge, married, to, his, business, partner, joseph, m, schenck, at, the, time, and, constance, talmadge, at, norma, s, home, in, bayside, queens, they, had, two, sons,

any, more, children, banishing, keaton, to, a, separate, bedroom, he, dated, actresses, dorothy, sebastian, and, kathleen, key, during, this, period, natalie, s, extravagance, was, another, factor, as, she, spent, up, to, a, third, of, her, husband, s, earnings, it, was, clear, that, mr, keaton, and, mrs, keaton, had, different, ideas, and, lifestyles, keaton, had, designed, and, built, a, modest, but, comfortable, cottage, like, home, as, a, surprise, wedding, gift, for, his, bride, when, she, saw, the, little, house, she, flew, into, a, rage, she, thought, the, house, was, much, too, small, with, no, place, for, servants, realizing, that, his, bride, wanted, a, palace, he, sold, the, cottage, to, mgm, executive, eddie, mannix, at, cost, and, commissioned, gene, verge, sr, in, 1926, to, build, a, 10, 000, square, foot, 930, m, 2, estate, in, beverly, hills, for, 300, 000, 5, 141, 000, in, 2024, neighbors, included, tom, mix, and, rudolph, valentino, among, famous,
