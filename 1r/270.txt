single, combat, and, took, for, trophies, the, weapons, of, the, vanquished, soldier, johnson, is, reputed, to, have, visited, the, antiquary, sir, robert, cotton, at, a, residence, of, his, in, chester, early, in, the, 17th, century, after, his, military, activity, on, the, continent, jonson, returned, to, england, and, worked, as, an, actor, and, as, a, playwright, as, an, actor, he, was,

playwright, employed, by, philip, henslowe, the, leading, producer, for, the, english, public, theatre, by, the, next, year, the, production, of, every, man, in, his, humour, 1598, had, established, jonson, s, reputation, as, a, dramatist, jonson, described, his, wife, to, william, drummond, as, a, shrew, yet, honest, the, identity, of, jonson, s, wife, is, obscure, though, she, sometimes, is, identified, as, ann, lewis, the, woman, who, married, a, benjamin, jonson, in, 1594, at, the, church, of, st, magnus, the, martyr, near, london, bridge, the, registers, of, st, martin, in, the, fields, record, that, mary, jonson, their, eldest, daughter, died, in, november, 1593, at, six, months, of, age, a, decade, later, in, 1603, benjamin, jonson, their, eldest, son, died, of, bubonic, plague, when, he, was, seven, years, old, upon, which, jonson, wrote, the, elegiac, on, my, first, sonne, 1603, a, second, son, also, named, benjamin, jonson, died, in, 1635, during, that, period, jonson, and, his, wife, lived, separate, lives, for, five, years, jonson, enjoyed, the, residential, hospitality, of, his, patrons, esme, stuart, 3rd, duke, of, lennox, and, 7th, seigneur, d, aubigny, and, sir, robert, townshend, by, summer, 1597, jonson, had, a, fixed, engagement, in, the, admiral, s, men, then, performing, under, philip, henslowe, s, management, at, the, rose, john, aubrey, reports, on, uncertain, authority, that, jonson, was, not, successful, as, an, actor, whatever, his, skills, as, an, actor, he, was, more, valuable, to, the, company, as, a, writer, by, this, time, jonson, had, begun, to, write, original, plays, for, the, admiral, s, men, in, 1598, he, was, mentioned, by, francis, meres, in, his, palladis, tamia, as, one, of, the, best, for, tragedy, none, of, his, early, tragedies, survive, however, an, undated, comedy, the, case, is, altered, may, be, his, earliest, surviving, play, in, 1597, a, play, which, he, co, wrote, with, thomas, nashe, the, isle, of, dogs, was, suppressed, after, causing, great, offence, arrest, warrants, for, jonson, and, nashe, were, issued, by, queen, elizabeth, i, s, so, called, interrogator, richard, topcliffe, jonson, was, jailed, in, marshalsea, prison, and, charged, with, leude, and, mutynous, behaviour, while, nashe, managed, to, escape, to, great, yarmouth, two, of, the, actors, gabriel, spenser, and, robert, shaw, were, also, imprisoned, a, year, later, jonson, was, again, briefly, imprisoned, this, time, in, newgate, prison, for, killing, gabriel, spenser, in, a, duel, on, 22, september, 1598, in, hogsden, fields, today, part, of, hoxton, tried, on, a, charge, of, manslaughter, jonson, pleaded, guilty, but, was, released, by, benefit, of, clergy, a, legal, ploy, through, which, he, gained, leniency, by, reciting, a, brief, bible, verse, the, neck, verse, forfeiting, his, goods, and, chattels, and, being, branded, with, the, so, called, tyburn, t, on, his, left, thumb, while, in, jail, jonson, converted, to, catholicism, possibly, through, the, influence, of, fellow, prisoner, father, thomas, wright, a, jesuit, priest, in, 1598, jonson, produced, his, first, great, success, every, man, in, his, humour, capitalising, on, the, vogue, for, humorous, plays, which, george, chapman, had, begun, with, an, humorous, day, s, mirth, william, shakespeare, was, among, the, first, actors, to, be, cast, jonson, followed, this, in, 1599, with, every, man, out, of, his, humour, a, pedantic, attempt, to, imitate, aristophanes, it, is, not, known, whether, this, was, a, success, on, stage, but, when, published, it, proved, popular, and, went, through, several, editions, jonson, s, other, work, for, the, theatre, in, the, last, years, of, elizabeth, i, s, reign, was, marked, by, fighting, and, controversy, cynthia, s, revels, was, produced, by, the, children, of, the, chapel, royal, at, blackfriars, theatre, in, 1600, it, satirised, both, john, marston, who, jonson, believed, had, accused, him, of, lustfulness, in, histriomastix, and, thomas, dekker, jonson, attacked, the, two, poets, again, in, poetaster, 1601, dekker, responded, with, satiromastix, subtitled, the, untrussing, of, the, humorous, poet, the, final, scene, of, this, play, while, certainly, not, to, be, taken, at, face, value, as, a, portrait, of, jonson, offers, a, caricature, that, is, recognisable, from, drummond, s, report, boasting, about, himself, and, condemning, other, poets, criticising, performances, of, his, plays, and, calling, attention, to, himself, in, any, available, way, this, war, of, the, theatres, appears, to, have, ended, with, reconciliation, on, all, sides, jonson, collaborated, with, dekker, on, a, pageant, welcoming, james, i, to, england, in, 1603, although, drummond, reports, that, jonson, called, dekker, a, rogue, marston, dedicated, the, malcontent, to, jonson, and, the, two, collaborated, with, chapman, on, eastward, ho, a, 1605, play, whose, anti, scottish, sentiment, briefly, landed, both, jonson, and, chapman, in, jail, at, the, beginning, of, the, english, reign, of, james, vi, and, i, in, 1603, jonson, joined, other, poets, and, playwrights, in, welcoming, the, new, king, jonson, quickly, adapted, himself, to, the, additional, demand, for, masques, and, entertainments, introduced, with, the, new, reign, and, fostered, by, both, the, king, and, his, consort, anne, of, denmark, in, addition, to, his, popularity, on, the, public, stage, and, in, the, royal, hall, he, enjoyed, the, patronage, of, aristocrats, such, as, elizabeth, sidney, daughter, of, sir, philip, sidney, and, lady, mary, wroth, this, connection, with, the, sidney, family, provided, the, impetus, for, one, of, jonson, s, most, famous, lyrics, the, country, house, poem, to, penshurst, in, february, 1603, john, manningham, reported, that, jonson, was, living, on, robert, townsend, son, of, sir, roger, townshend, and, scorns, the, world, perhaps, this, explains, why, his, trouble, with, english, authorities, continued, that, same, year, he, was, questioned, by, the, privy, council, about, sejanus, a, politically, themed, play, about, corruption, in, the, roman, empire, he, was, again, in, trouble, for, topical, allusions, in, a, play, now, lost, in, which, he, took, part, shortly, after, his, release, from, a, brief, spell, of, imprisonment, imposed, to, mark, the, authorities, displeasure, at, the, work, in, the, second, week, of, october, 1605, he, was, present, at, a, supper, party, attended, by, most, of, the, gunpowder, plot, conspirators, after, the, plot, s, discovery, he, appears, to, have, avoided, further, imprisonment, he, volunteered, what, he, knew, of, the, affair, to, the, investigator, robert, cecil, and, the, privy, council, father, thomas, wright, who, heard, fawkes, s, confession, was, known, to, jonson, from, prison, in, 1598, and, cecil, may, have, directed, him, to, bring, the, priest, before, the, council, as, a, witness, at, the, same, time, jonson, pursued, a, more, prestigious, career, writing, masques, for, james, s, court, the, satyr, 1603, and, the, masque, of, blackness, 1605, are, two, of, about, two, dozen, masques, which, jonson, wrote, for, james, or, for, queen, anne, some, of, them, performed, at, apethorpe, palace, when, the, king, was, in, residence, the, masque, of, blackness, was, praised, by, algernon, charles, swinburne, as, the, consummate, example, of, this, now, extinct, genre, which, mingled, speech, dancing, and, spectacle, on, many, of, these, projects, he, collaborated, not, always, peacefully, with, designer, inigo, jones, for, example, jones, designed, the, scenery, for, jonson, s, masque, oberon, the, faery, prince, performed, at, whitehall, on, 1, january, 1611, in, which, prince, henry, eldest, son, of, james, i, appeared, in, the, title, role, perhaps, partly, as, a, result, of, this, new, career, jonson, gave, up, writing, plays, for, the, public, theatres, for, a, decade, he, later, told, drummond, that, he, had, made, less, than, two, hundred, pounds, on, all, his, plays, together, in, 1616, jonson, received, a, yearly, pension, of, 100, marks, about, 60, leading, some, to, identify, him, as, england, s, first, poet, laureate, this, sign, of, royal, favour, may, have, encouraged, him, to, publish, the, first, volume, of, the, folio, collected, edition, of, his, works, that, year, other, volumes, followed, in, 1640, 41, and, 1692, see, ben, jonson, folios, on, 8, july, 1618, jonson, set, out, from, bishopsgate, in, london, to, walk, to, edinburgh, arriving, in, scotland, s, capital, on, 17, september, for, the, most, part, he, followed, the, great, north, road, and, was, treated, to, lavish, and, enthusiastic, welcomes, in, both, towns, and, country, houses, on, his, arrival, he, lodged, initially, with, john, stuart, a, cousin, of, king, james, in, leith, and, was, made, an, honorary, burgess, of, edinburgh, at, a, dinner, laid, on, by, the, city, on, 26, september, he, stayed, in, scotland, until, late, january, 1619, and, the, best, remembered, hospitality, he, enjoyed, was, that, of, the, scottish, poet, william, drummond, of, hawthornden, sited, on, the, river, esk, drummond, undertook, to, record, as, much, of, jonson, s, conversation, as, he, could, in, his, diary, and, thus, recorded, aspects, of, jonson, s, personality, that, would, otherwise, have, been, less, clearly, seen, jonson, delivers, his, opinions, in, drummond, s, terse, reporting, in, an, expansive, and, even, magisterial, mood, drummond, noted, he, was, a, great, lover, and, praiser, of, himself, a, contemner, and, scorner, of, others, on, returning, to, england, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, master, of, arts, degree, from, oxford, university, the, period, between, 1605, and, 1620, may, be, viewed, as, jonson, s, heyday, by, 1616, he, had, produced, all, the, plays, on, which, his, present, reputation, as, a, dramatist, is, based, including, the, tragedy, catiline, acted, and, printed, 1611, which, achieved, limited, success, and, the, comedies, volpone, acted, 1605, and, printed, in, 1607, epicoene, or, the, silent, woman, 1609, the, alchemist, 1610, bartholomew, fair, 1614, and, the, devil, is, an, ass, 1616, the, alchemist, and, volpone, were, immediately, successful, of, epicoene, jonson, told, drummond, of, a, satirical, verse, which, reported, that, the, play, s, subtitle, was, appropriate, since, its, audience, had, refused, to, applaud, the, play, i, e, remained, silent, yet, epicoene, along, with, bartholomew, fair, and, to, a, lesser, extent, the, devil, is, an, ass, have, in, modern, times, achieved, a, certain, degree, of, recognition, while, his, life, during, this, period, was, apparently, more, settled, than, it, had, been, in, the, 1590s, his, financial, security, was, still, not, assured, jonson, recounted, that, his, father, had, been, a, prosperous, protestant, landowner, until, the, reign, of, bloody, mary, and, had, suffered, imprisonment, and, the, forfeiture, of, his, wealth, during, that, monarch, s, attempt, to, restore, england, to, catholicism, on, elizabeth, s, accession, he, had, been, freed, and, had, been, able, to, travel, to, london, to, become, a, clergyman, all, that, is, known, of, jonson, s, father, who, died, a, month, before, his, son, was, born, comes, from, the, poet, s, own, narrative, jonson, s, elementary, education, was, in, a, small, church, school, attached, to, st, martin, in, the, fields, parish, and, at, the, age, of, about, seven, he, secured, a, place, at, westminster, school, then, part, of, westminster, abbey, notwithstanding, this, emphatically, protestant, grounding, jonson, maintained, an, interest, in, catholic, doctrine, throughout, his, adult, life, and, at, a, particularly, perilous, time, while, a, religious, war, with, spain, was, widely, expected, and, persecution, of, catholics, was, intensifying, he, converted, to, the, faith, this, took, place, in, october, 1598, while, jonson, was, on, remand, in, newgate, gaol, charged, with, manslaughter, jonson, s, biographer, ian, donaldson, is, among, those, who, suggest, that, the, conversion, was, instigated, by, father, thomas, wright, a, jesuit, priest, who, had, resigned, from, the, order, over, his, acceptance, of, queen, elizabeth, s, right, to, rule, in, england, wright, although, placed, under, house, arrest, on, the, orders, of, lord, burghley, was, permitted, to, minister, to, the, inmates, of, london, prisons, it, may, have, been, that, jonson, fearing, that, his, trial, would, go, against, him, was, seeking, the, unequivocal, absolution, that, catholicism, could, offer, if, he, were, sentenced, to, death, alternatively, he, could, have, been, looking, to, personal, advantage, from, accepting, conversion, since, father, wright, s, protector, the, earl, of, essex, was, among, those, who, might, hope, to, rise, to, influence, after, the, succession, of, a, new, monarch, jonson, s, conversion, came, at, a, weighty, time, in, affairs, of, state, the, royal, succession, from, the, childless, elizabeth, had, not, been, settled, and, essex, s, catholic, allies, were, hopeful, that, a, sympathetic, ruler, might, attain, the, throne, conviction, and, certainly, not, expedience, alone, sustained, jonson, s, faith, during, the, troublesome, twelve, years, he, remained, a, catholic, his, stance, received, attention, beyond, the, low, level, intolerance, to, which, most, followers, of, that, faith, were, exposed, the, first, draft, of, his, play, sejanus, his, fall, was, banned, for, popery, and, did, not, re, appear, until, some, offending, passages, were, cut, in, january, 1606, he, with, anne, his, wife, appeared, before, the, consistory, court, in, london, to, answer, a, charge, of, recusancy, with, jonson, alone, additionally, accused, of, allowing, his, fame, as, a, catholic, to, seduce, citizens, to, the, cause, this, was, a, serious, matter, the, gunpowder, plot, was, still, fresh, in, people, s, minds, but, he, explained, that, his, failure, to, take, communion, was, only, because, he, had, not, found, sound, theological, endorsement, for, the, practice, and, by, paying, a, fine, of, thirteen, shillings, 156, pence, he, escaped, the, more, serious, penalties, at, the, authorities, disposal, his, habit, was, to, slip, outside, during, the, sacrament, a, common, routine, at, the, time, indeed, it, was, one, followed, by, the, royal, consort, queen, anne, of, denmark, herself, to, show, political, loyalty, while, not, offending, the, conscience, leading, church, figures, including, john, overall, dean, of, st, paul, s, were, tasked, with, winning, jonson, back, to, protestantism, but, these, overtures, were, resisted, in, may, 1610, henry, iv, of, france, was, assassinated, purportedly, in, the, name, of, the, pope, he, had, been, a, catholic, monarch, respected, in, england, for, tolerance, towards, protestants, and, his, murder, seems, to, have, been, the, immediate, cause, of, jonson, s, decision, to, rejoin, the, church, of, england, he, did, this, in, flamboyant, style, pointedly, drinking, a, full, chalice, of, communion, wine, at, the, eucharist, to, demonstrate, his, renunciation, of, the, catholic, rite, in, which, the, priest, alone, drinks, the, wine, the, exact, date, of, the, ceremony, is, unknown, however, his, interest, in, catholic, belief, and, practice, remained, with, him, until, his, death, jonson, s, productivity, began, to, decline, in, the, 1620s, but, he, remained, well, known, in, that, time, the, sons, of, ben, or, the, tribe, of, ben, those, younger, poets, such, as, robert, herrick, richard, lovelace, and, sir, john, suckling, who, took, their, bearing, in, verse, from, jonson, rose, to, prominence, however, a, series, of, setbacks, drained, his, strength, and, damaged, his, reputation, he, resumed, writing, regular, plays, in, the, 1620s, but, these, are, not, considered, among, his, best, they, are, of, significant, interest, however, for, their, portrayal, of, charles, i, s, england, the, staple, of, news, for, example, offers, a, remarkable, look, at, the, earliest, stage, of, english, journalism, the, lukewarm, reception, given, that, play, was, however, nothing, compared, to, the, dismal, failure, of, the, new, inn, the, cold, reception, given, this, play, prompted, jonson, to, write, a, poem, condemning, his, audience, an, ode, to, himself, which, in, turn, prompted, thomas, carew, one, of, the, tribe, of, ben, to, respond, in, a, poem, that, asks, jonson, to, recognise, his, own, decline, the, principal, factor, in, jonson, s, partial, eclipse, was, however, the, death, of, james, and, the, accession, of, king, charles, i, in, 1625, jonson, felt, neglected, by, the, new, court, a, decisive, quarrel, with, jones, harmed, his, career, as, a, writer, of, court, masques, although, he, continued, to, entertain, the, court, on, an, irregular, basis, for, his, part, charles, displayed, a, certain, degree, of, care, for, the, great, poet, of, his, father, s, day, he, increased, jonson, s, annual, pension, to, 100, and, included, a, tierce, of, wine, and, beer, despite, the, strokes, that, he, suffered, in, the, 1620s, jonson, continued, to, write, at, his, death, in, 1637, he, seems, to, have, been, working, on, another, play, the, sad, shepherd, though, only, two, acts, are, extant, this, represents, a, remarkable, new, direction, for, jonson, a, move, into, pastoral, drama, during, the, early, 1630s, he, also, conducted, a, correspondence, with, james, howell, who, warned, him, about, disfavour, at, court, in, the, wake, of, his, dispute, with, jones, jonson, died, on, or, around, 16, august, 1637, and, his, funeral, was, held, the, next, day, it, was, attended, by, all, or, the, greatest, part, of, the, nobility, then, in, town, he, is, buried, in, the, north, aisle, of, the, nave, in, westminster, abbey, with, the, inscription, o, rare, ben, johnson, set, in, the, slab, over, his, grave, john, aubrey, in, a, more, meticulous, record, than, usual, notes, that, a, passer, by, john, young, of, great, milton, oxfordshire, saw, the, bare, grave, marker, and, on, impulse, paid, a, workman, eighteen, pence, to, make, the, inscription, another, theory, suggests, that, the, tribute, came, from, william, davenant, jonson, s, successor, as, poet, laureate, and, card, playing, companion, of, young, as, the, same, phrase, appears, on, davenant, s, nearby, gravestone, but, essayist, leigh, hunt, contends, that, davenant, s, wording, represented, no, more, than, young, s, coinage, cheaply, re, used, the, fact, that, jonson, was, buried, in, an, upright, position, was, an, indication, of, his, reduced, circumstances, at, the, time, of, his, death, although, it, has, also, been, written, that, he, asked, for, a, grave, exactly, 18, inches, square, from, the, monarch, and, received, an, upright, grave, to, fit, in, the, requested, space, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, the, inscription, could, be, read, orare, ben, jonson, pray, for, ben, jonson, possibly, in, an, allusion, to, jonson, s, acceptance, of, catholic, doctrine, during, his, lifetime, although, he, had, returned, to, the, church, of, england, the, carving, shows, a, distinct, space, between, o, and, rare, a, monument, to, jonson, was, erected, in, about, 1723, by, the, earl, of, oxford, and, is, in, the, eastern, aisle, of, westminster, abbey, s, poets, corner, it, includes, a, portrait, medallion, and, the, same, inscription, as, on, the, gravestone, it, seems, jonson, was, to, have, had, a, monument, erected, by, subscription, soon, after, his, death, but, the, english, civil, war, intervened, apart, from, two, tragedies, sejanus, and, catiline, that, largely, failed, to, impress, renaissance, audiences, jonson, s, work, for, the, public, theatres, was, in, comedy, these, plays, vary, in, some, respects, the, minor, early, plays, particularly, those, written, for, boy, players, present, somewhat, looser, plots, and, less, developed, characters, than, those, written, later, for, adult, companies, already, in, the, plays, which, were, his, salvos, in, the, poets, war, he, displays, the, keen, eye, for, absurdity, and, hypocrisy, that, marks, his, best, known, plays, in, these, early, efforts, however, the, plot, mostly, takes, second, place, to, a, variety, of, incident, and, comic, set, pieces, they, are, also, notably, ill, tempered, thomas, davies, called, poetaster, a, contemptible, mixture, of, the, serio, comic, where, the, names, of, augustus, caesar, maecenas, virgil, horace, ovid, and, tibullus, are, all, sacrificed, upon, the, altar, of, private, resentment, another, early, comedy, in, a, different, vein, the, case, is, altered, is, markedly, similar, to, shakespeare, s, romantic, comedies, in, its, foreign, setting, emphasis, on, genial, wit, and, love, plot, henslowe, s, diary, indicates, that, jonson, had, a, hand, in, numerous, other, plays, including, many, in, genres, such, as, english, history, with, which, he, is, not, otherwise, associated, the, comedies, of, his, middle, career, from, eastward, hoe, to, the, devil, is, an, ass, are, for, the, most, part, city, comedy, with, a, london, setting, themes, of, trickery, and, money, and, a, distinct, moral, ambiguity, despite, jonson, s, professed, aim, in, the, prologue, to, volpone, to, mix, profit, with, your, pleasure, his, late, plays, or, dotages, particularly, the, magnetic, lady, and, the, sad, shepherd, exhibit, signs, of, an, accommodation, with, the, romantic, tendencies, of, elizabethan, comedy, within, this, general, progression, however, jonson, s, comic, style, remained, constant, and, easily, recognisable, he, announces, his, programme, in, the, prologue, to, the, folio, version, of, every, man, in, his, humour, he, promises, to, represent, deeds, and, language, such, as, men, do, use, he, planned, to, write, comedies, that, revived, the, classical, premises, of, elizabethan, dramatic, theory, or, rather, since, all, but, the, loosest, english, comedies, could, claim, some, descent, from, plautus, and, terence, he, intended, to, apply, those, premises, with, rigour, this, commitment, entailed, negations, after, the, case, is, altered, jonson, eschewed, distant, locations, noble, characters, romantic, plots, and, other, staples, of, elizabethan, comedy, focusing, instead, on, the, satiric, and, realistic, inheritance, of, new, comedy, he, set, his, plays, in, contemporary, settings, peopled, them, with, recognisable, types, and, set, them, to, actions, that, if, not, strictly, realistic, involved, everyday, motives, such, as, greed, and, jealousy, in, accordance, with, the, temper, of, his, age, he, was, often, so, broad, in, his, characterisation, that, many, of, his, most, famous, scenes, border, on, the, farcical, as, william, congreve, for, example, judged, epicoene, he, was, more, diligent, in, adhering, to, the, classical, unities, than, many, of, his, peers, although, as, margaret, cavendish, noted, the, unity, of, action, in, the, major, comedies, was, rather, compromised, by, jonson, s, abundance, of, incident, to, this, classical, model, jonson, applied, the, two, features, of, his, style, which, save, his, classical, imitations, from, mere, pedantry, the, vividness, with, which, he, depicted, the, lives, of, his, characters, and, the, intricacy, of, his, plots, coleridge, for, instance, claimed, that, the, alchemist, had, one, of, the, three, most, perfect, plots, in, literature, jonson, s, poetry, like, his, drama, is, informed, by, his, classical, learning, some, of, his, better, known, poems, are, close, translations, of, greek, or, roman, models, all, display, the, careful, attention, to, form, and, style, that, often, came, naturally, to, those, trained, in, classics, in, the, humanist, manner, jonson, largely, avoided, the, debates, about, rhyme, and, meter, that, had, consumed, elizabethan, classicists, such, as, thomas, campion, and, gabriel, harvey, accepting, both, rhyme, and, stress, jonson, used, them, to, mimic, the, classical, qualities, of, simplicity, restraint, and, precision, epigrams, published, in, the, 1616, folio, is, an, entry, in, a, genre, that, was, popular, among, late, elizabethan, and, jacobean, audiences, although, jonson, was, perhaps, the, only, poet, of, his, time, to, work, in, its, full, classical, range, the, epigrams, explore, various, attitudes, most, from, the, satiric, stock, of, the, day, complaints, against, women, courtiers, and, spies, abound, the, condemnatory, poems, are, short, and, anonymous, jonson, s, epigrams, of, praise, including, a, famous, poem, to, camden, and, lines, to, lucy, harington, are, longer, and, are, mostly, addressed, to, specific, individuals, although, it, is, included, among, the, epigrams, on, my, first, sonne, is, neither, satirical, nor, very, short, the, poem, intensely, personal, and, deeply, felt, typifies, a, genre, that, would, come, to, be, called, lyric, poetry, it, is, possible, that, the, spelling, of, son, as, sonne, is, meant, to, allude, to, the, sonnet, form, with, which, it, shares, some, features, a, few, other, so, called, epigrams, share, this, quality, jonson, s, poems, of, the, forest, also, appeared, in, the, first, folio, most, of, the, fifteen, poems, are, addressed, to, jonson, s, aristocratic, supporters, but, the, most, famous, are, his, country, house, poem, to, penshurst, and, the, poem, to, celia, come, my, celia, let, us, prove, that, appears, also, in, volpone, underwood, published, in, the, expanded, folio, of, 1640, is, a, larger, and, more, heterogeneous, group, of, poems, it, contains, a, celebration, of, charis, jonson, s, most, extended, effort, at, love, poetry, various, religious, pieces, encomiastic, poems, including, the, poem, to, shakespeare, and, a, sonnet, on, mary, wroth, the, execration, against, vulcan, and, others, the, 1640, volume, also, contains, three, elegies, which, have, often, been, ascribed, to, donne, one, of, them, appeared, in, donne, s, posthumous, collected, poems, there, are, many, legends, about, jonson, s, rivalry, with, shakespeare, william, drummond, reports, that, during, their, conversation, jonson, scoffed, at, two, apparent, absurdities, in, shakespeare, s, plays, a, nonsensical, line, in, julius, caesar, and, the, setting, of, the, winter, s, tale, on, the, non, existent, seacoast, of, bohemia, drummond, also, reported, jonson, as, saying, that, shakespeare, wanted, art, i, e, lacked, skill, in, de, shakespeare, nostrat, in, timber, which, was, published, posthumously, and, reflects, his, lifetime, of, practical, experience, jonson, offers, a, fuller, and, more, conciliatory, comment, he, recalls, being, told, by, certain, actors, that, shakespeare, never, blotted, i, e, crossed, out, a, line, when, he, wrote, his, own, claimed, response, was, would, he, had, blotted, a, thousand, however, jonson, explains, hee, was, indeed, honest, and, of, an, open, and, free, nature, had, an, excellent, phantsie, brave, notions, and, gentle, expressions, wherein, hee, flow, d, with, that, facility, that, sometime, it, was, necessary, he, should, be, stopp, d, jonson, concludes, that, there, was, ever, more, in, him, to, be, praised, than, to, be, pardoned, when, shakespeare, died, he, said, he, was, not, of, an, age, but, for, all, time, thomas, fuller, relates, stories, of, jonson, and, shakespeare, engaging, in, debates, in, the, mermaid, tavern, fuller, imagines, conversations, in, which, shakespeare, would, run, rings, around, the, more, learned, but, more, ponderous, jonson, that, the, two, men, knew, each, other, personally, is, beyond, doubt, not, only, because, of, the, tone, of, jonson, s, references, to, him, but, because, shakespeare, s, company, produced, a, number, of, jonson, s, plays, at, least, two, of, which, every, man, in, his, humour, and, sejanus, his, fall, shakespeare, certainly, acted, in, however, it, is, now, impossible, to, tell, how, much, personal, communication, they, had, and, tales, of, their, friendship, cannot, be, substantiated, jonson, s, most, influential, and, revealing, commentary, on, shakespeare, is, the, second, of, the, two, poems, that, he, contributed, to, the, prefatory, verse, that, opens, shakespeare, s, first, folio, this, poem, to, the, memory, of, my, beloved, the, author, mr, william, shakespeare, and, what, he, hath, left, us, did, a, good, deal, to, create, the, traditional, view, of, shakespeare, as, a, poet, who, despite, small, latine, and, lesse, greeke, had, a, natural, genius, the, poem, has, traditionally, been, thought, to, exemplify, the, contrast, which, jonson, perceived, between, himself, the, disciplined, and, erudite, classicist, scornful, of, ignorance, and, sceptical, of, the, masses, and, shakespeare, represented, in, the, poem, as, a, kind, of, natural, wonder, whose, genius, was, not, subject, to, any, rules, except, those, of, the, audiences, for, which, he, wrote, but, the, poem, itself, qualifies, this, view, some, view, this, elegy, as, a, conventional, exercise, but, others, see, it, as, a, heartfelt, tribute, to, the, sweet, swan, of, avon, the, soul, of, the, age, it, has, been, argued, that, jonson, helped, to, edit, the, first, folio, and, he, may, have, been, inspired, to, write, this, poem, by, reading, his, fellow, playwright, s, works, a, number, of, which, had, been, previously, either, unpublished, or, available, in, less, satisfactory, versions, in, a, relatively, complete, form, jonson, was, a, towering, literary, figure, and, his, influence, was, enormous, for, he, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, vigorous, minds, that, ever, added, to, the, strength, of, english, literature, before, the, english, civil, war, the, tribe, of, ben, touted, his, importance, and, during, the, restoration, jonson, s, satirical, comedies, and, his, theory, and, practice, of, humour, characters, which, are, often, misunderstood, see, william, congreve, s, letters, for, clarification, was, extremely, influential, providing, the, blueprint, for, many, restoration, comedies, john, aubrey, wrote, of, jonson, in, brief, lives, by, 1700, jonson, s, status, began, to, decline, in, the, romantic, era, jonson, suffered, the, fate, of, being, unfairly, compared, and, contrasted, to, shakespeare, as, the, taste, for, jonson, s, type, of, satirical, comedy, decreased, jonson, was, at, times, greatly, appreciated, by, the, romantics, but, overall, he, was, denigrated, for, not, writing, in, a, shakespearean, vein, in, 2012, after, more, than, two, decades, of, research, cambridge, university, press, published, the, first, new, edition, of, jonson, s, complete, works, for, 60, years, as, g, e, bentley, notes, in, shakespeare, and, jonson, their, reputations, in, the, seventeenth, century, compared, jonson, s, reputation, was, in, some, respects, equal, to, shakespeare, s, in, the, 17th, century, after, the, english, theatres, were, reopened, on, the, restoration, of, charles, ii, jonson, s, work, along, with, shakespeare, s, and, fletcher, s, formed, the, initial, core, of, the, restoration, repertory, it, was, not, until, after, 1710, that, shakespeare, s, plays, ordinarily, in, heavily, revised, forms, were, more, frequently, performed, than, those, of, his, renaissance, contemporaries, many, critics, since, the, 18th, century, have, ranked, jonson, below, only, shakespeare, among, english, renaissance, dramatists, critical, judgment, has, tended, to, emphasise, the, very, qualities, that, jonson, himself, lauds, in, his, prefaces, in, timber, and, in, his, scattered, prefaces, and, dedications, the, realism, and, propriety, of, his, language, the, bite, of, his, satire, and, the, care, with, which, he, plotted, his, comedies, for, some, critics, the, temptation, to, contrast, jonson, representing, art, or, craft, with, shakespeare, representing, nature, or, untutored, genius, has, seemed, natural, jonson, himself, may, be, said, to, have, initiated, this, interpretation, in, the, second, folio, and, samuel, butler, drew, the, same, comparison, in, his, commonplace, book, later, in, the, century, at, the, restoration, this, sensed, difference, became, a, kind, of, critical, dogma, charles, de, saint, vremond, placed, jonson, s, comedies, above, all, else, in, english, drama, and, charles, gildon, called, jonson, the, father, of, english, comedy, john, dryden, offered, a, more, common, assessment, in, the, essay, of, dramatic, poesie, in, which, his, avatar, neander, compares, shakespeare, to, homer, and, jonson, to, virgil, the, former, represented, profound, creativity, the, latter, polished, artifice, but, artifice, was, in, the, 17th, century, almost, synonymous, with, art, jonson, for, instance, used, artificer, as, a, synonym, for, artist, discoveries, 33, for, lewis, theobald, too, jonson, ow, all, his, excellence, to, his, art, in, contrast, to, shakespeare, the, natural, genius, nicholas, rowe, to, whom, may, be, traced, the, legend, that, jonson, owed, the, production, of, every, man, in, his, humour, to, shakespeare, s, intercession, likewise, attributed, jonson, s, excellence, to, learning, which, did, not, raise, him, quite, to, the, level, of, genius, a, consensus, formed, jonson, was, the, first, english, poet, to, understand, classical, precepts, with, any, accuracy, and, he, was, the, first, to, apply, those, precepts, successfully, to, contemporary, life, but, there, were, also, more, negative, spins, on, jonson, s, learned, art, for, instance, in, the, 1750s, edward, young, casually, remarked, on, the, way, in, which, jonson, s, learning, worked, like, samson, s, strength, to, his, own, detriment, earlier, aphra, behn, writing, in, defence, of, female, playwrights, had, pointed, to, jonson, as, a, writer, whose, learning, did, not, make, him, popular, unsurprisingly, she, compares, him, unfavourably, to, shakespeare, particularly, in, the, tragedies, with, their, lengthy, speeches, abstracted, from, sallust, and, cicero, augustan, critics, saw, a, writer, whose, learning, had, swamped, his, aesthetic, judgment, in, this, period, alexander, pope, is, exceptional, in, that, he, noted, the, tendency, to, exaggeration, in, these, competing, critical, portraits, it, is, ever, the, nature, of, parties, to, be, in, extremes, and, nothing, is, so, probable, as, that, because, ben, jonson, had, much, the, most, learning, it, was, said, on, the, one, hand, that, shakespear, had, none, at, all, and, because, shakespear, had, much, the, most, wit, and, fancy, it, was, retorted, on, the, other, that, jonson, wanted, both, for, the, most, part, the, 18th, century, consensus, remained, committed, to, the, division, that, pope, doubted, as, late, as, the, 1750s, sarah, fielding, could, put, a, brief, recapitulation, of, this, analysis, in, the, mouth, of, a, man, of, sense, encountered, by, david, simple, though, his, stature, declined, during, the, 18th, century, jonson, was, still, read, and, commented, on, throughout, the, century, generally, in, the, kind, of, comparative, and, dismissive, terms, just, described, heinrich, wilhelm, von, gerstenberg, translated, parts, of, peter, whalley, s, edition, into, german, in, 1765, shortly, before, the, romantic, revolution, edward, capell, offered, an, almost, unqualified, rejection, of, jonson, as, a, dramatic, poet, who, he, writes, has, very, poor, pretensions, to, the, high, place, he, holds, among, the, english, bards, as, there, is, no, original, manner, to, distinguish, him, and, the, tedious, sameness, visible, in, his, plots, indicates, a, defect, of, genius, the, disastrous, failures, of, productions, of, volpone, and, epicoene, in, the, early, 1770s, no, doubt, bolstered, a, widespread, sense, that, jonson, had, at, last, grown, too, antiquated, for, the, contemporary, public, if, he, still, attracted, enthusiasts, such, as, earl, camden, and, william, gifford, he, all, but, disappeared, from, the, stage, in, the, last, quarter, of, the, century, the, romantic, revolution, in, criticism, brought, about, an, overall, decline, in, the, critical, estimation, of, jonson, hazlitt, refers, dismissively, to, jonson, s, laborious, caution, coleridge, while, more, respectful, describes, jonson, as, psychologically, superficial, he, was, a, very, accurately, observing, man, but, he, cared, only, to, observe, what, was, open, to, and, likely, to, impress, the, senses, coleridge, placed, jonson, second, only, to, shakespeare, other, romantic, critics, were, less, approving, the, early, 19th, century, was, the, great, age, for, recovering, renaissance, drama, jonson, whose, reputation, had, survived, appears, to, have, been, less, interesting, to, some, readers, than, writers, such, as, thomas, middleton, or, john, heywood, who, were, in, some, senses, discoveries, of, the, 19th, century, moreover, the, emphasis, which, the, romantic, writers, placed, on, imagination, and, their, concomitant, tendency, to, distrust, studied, art, lowered, jonson, s, status, if, it, also, sharpened, their, awareness, of, the, difference, traditionally, noted, between, jonson, and, shakespeare, this, trend, was, by, no, means, universal, however, william, gifford, jonson, s, first, editor, of, the, 19th, century, did, a, great, deal, to, defend, jonson, s, reputation, during, this, period, of, general, decline, in, the, next, era, swinburne, who, was, more, interested, in, jonson, than, most, victorians, wrote, the, flowers, of, his, growing, have, every, quality, but, one, which, belongs, to, the, rarest, and, finest, among, flowers, they, have, colour, form, variety, fertility, vigour, the, one, thing, they, want, is, fragrance, by, fragrance, swinburne, means, spontaneity, in, the, 20th, century, jonson, s, body, of, work, has, been, subject, to, a, more, varied, set, of, analyses, broadly, consistent, with, the, interests, and, programmes, of, modern, literary, criticism, in, an, essay, printed, in, the, sacred, wood, t, s, eliot, attempted, to, repudiate, the, charge, that, jonson, was, an, arid, classicist, by, analysing, the, role, of, imagination, in, his, dialogue, eliot, was, appreciative, of, jonson, s, overall, conception, and, his, surface, a, view, consonant, with, the, modernist, reaction, against, romantic, criticism, which, tended, to, denigrate, playwrights, who, did, not, concentrate, on, representations, of, psychological, depth, around, mid, century, a, number, of, critics, and, scholars, followed, eliot, s, lead, producing, detailed, studies, of, jonson, s, verbal, style, at, the, same, time, study, of, elizabethan, themes, and, conventions, such, as, those, by, e, e, stoll, and, m, c, bradbrook, provided, a, more, vivid, sense, of, how, jonson, s, work, was, shaped, by, the, expectations, of, his, time, the, proliferation, of, new, critical, perspectives, after, mid, century, touched, on, jonson, inconsistently, jonas, barish, was, the, leading, figure, among, critics, who, appreciated, jonson, s, artistry, on, the, other, hand, jonson, received, less, attention, from, the, new, critics, than, did, some, other, playwrights, and, his, work, was, not, of, programmatic, interest, to, psychoanalytic, critics, but, jonson, s, career, eventually, made, him, a, focal, point, for, the, revived, sociopolitical, criticism, jonson, s, works, particularly, his, masques, and, pageants, offer, significant, information, regarding, the, relations, of, literary, production, and, political, power, as, do, his, contacts, with, and, poems, for, aristocratic, patrons, moreover, his, career, at, the, centre, of, london, s, emerging, literary, world, has, been, seen, as, exemplifying, the, development, of, a, fully, commodified, literary, culture, in, this, respect, he, is, seen, as, a, transitional, figure, an, author, whose, skills, and, ambition, led, him, to, a, leading, role, both, in, the, declining, culture, of, patronage, and, in, the, rising, culture, of, mass, media, jonson, has, been, called, the, first, poet, laureate, if, jonson, s, reputation, as, a, playwright, has, traditionally, been, linked, to, shakespeare, his, reputation, as, a, poet, has, since, the, early, 20th, century, been, linked, to, that, of, john, donne, in, this, comparison, jonson, represents, the, cavalier, strain, of, poetry, emphasising, grace, and, clarity, of, expression, donne, by, contrast, epitomised, the, metaphysical, school, of, poetry, with, its, reliance, on, strained, baroque, metaphors, and, often, vague, phrasing, since, the, critics, who, made, this, comparison, herbert, grierson, for, example, were, to, varying, extents, rediscovering, donne, this, comparison, often, worked, to, the, detriment, of, jonson, s, reputation, in, his, time, jonson, was, at, least, as, influential, as, donne, in, 1623, historian, edmund, bolton, named, him, the, best, and, most, polished, english, poet, that, this, judgment, was, widely, shared, is, indicated, by, the, admitted, influence, he, had, on, younger, poets, the, grounds, for, describing, jonson, as, the, father, of, cavalier, poets, are, clear, many, of, the, cavalier, poets, described, themselves, as, his, sons, or, his, tribe, for, some, of, this, tribe, the, connection, was, as, much, social, as, poetic, herrick, described, meetings, at, the, sun, the, dog, the, triple, tunne, all, of, them, including, those, like, herrick, whose, accomplishments, in, verse, are, generally, regarded, as, superior, to, jonson, s, took, inspiration, from, jonson, s, revival, of, classical, forms, and, themes, his, subtle, melodies, and, his, disciplined, use, of, wit, in, these, respects, jonson, may, be, regarded, as, among, the, most, important, figures, in, the, prehistory, of, english, neoclassicism, popular, culture, his, queen, and, huntress, was, used, in, slightly, amended, form, by, mike, oldfield, on, side, 4, of, his, multi, album, set, incantations, the, lyrics, can, be, found, on, his, website, confirming, its, the, same, poem, the, best, of, jonson, s, lyrics, have, remained, current, since, his, time, periodically, they, experience, a, brief, vogue, as, after, the, publication, of, peter, whalley, s, edition, of, 1756, jonson, s, poetry, continues, to, interest, scholars, for, the, light, which, it, sheds, on, english, literary, history, such, as, politics, systems, of, patronage, and, intellectual, attitudes, for, the, general, reader, jonson, s, reputation, rests, on, a, few, lyrics, that, though, brief, are, surpassed, for, grace, and, precision, by, very, few, renaissance, poems, on, my, first, sonne, to, celia, to, penshurst, and, the, epitaph, on, salomon, pavy, a, boy, player, abducted, from, his, parents, who, acted, in, jonson, s, plays, it, is, in, jonson, s, timber, or, discoveries, that, he, famously, quipped, on, the, manner, in, which, language, became, a, measure, of, the, speaker, or, writer, language, most, shows, a, man, speak, that, i, may, see, thee, it, springs, out, of, the, most, retired, and, inmost, parts, of, us, and, is, the, image, of, the, parent, of, it, the, mind, no, glass, renders, a, man, s, form, or, likeness, so, true, as, his, speech, nay, it, is, likened, to, a, man, and, as, we, consider, feature, and, composition, in, a, man, so, words, in, language, in, the, greatness, aptness, sound, structure, and, harmony, of, it, as, with, other, english, renaissance, dramatists, a, portion, of, ben, jonson, s, literary, output, has, not, survived, in, addition, to, the, isle, of, dogs, 1597, the, records, suggest, these, lost, plays, as, wholly, or, partially, jonson, s, work, richard, crookback, 1602, hot, anger, soon, cold, 1598, with, porter, and, henry, chettle, page, of, plymouth, 1599, with, dekker, and, robert, ii, king, of, scots, 1599, with, chettle, and, dekker, several, of, jonson, s, masques, and, entertainments, also, are, not, extant, the, entertainment, at, merchant, taylors, 1607, the, entertainment, at, salisbury, house, for, james, i, 1608, and, the, may, lord, 1613, 19, finally, there, are, questionable, or, borderline, attributions, jonson, may, have, had, a, hand, in, rollo, duke, of, normandy, or, the, bloody, brother, a, play, in, the, canon, of, john, fletcher, and, his, collaborators, the, comedy, the, widow, was, printed, in, 1652, as, the, work, of, thomas, middleton, fletcher, and, jonson, though, scholars, have, been, intensely, sceptical, about, jonson, s, presence, in, the, play, a, few, attributions, of, anonymous, plays, such, as, the, london, prodigal, have, been, ventured, by, individual, researchers, but, have, met, with, cool, responses
