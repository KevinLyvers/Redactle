yi, ordered, the, fleet, to, feign, withdrawal, which, caused, the, japanese, to, eagerly, pursue, the, korean, fleet, with, their, 12, vessels, with, the, japanese, ships, drawn, out, of, the, safety, of, the, harbor, the, korean, navy, countered, and, with, the, turtle, ship, leading, the, charge, they, successfully, destroyed, all, 12, ships, admiral, yi, was, shot, by, a, bullet, in,

yoshitaka, they, were, the, only, ones, with, naval, responsibilities, in, the, entire, japanese, invasion, force, however, the, admirals, arrived, in, busan, nine, days, before, hideyoshi, s, order, was, actually, issued, and, assembled, a, squadron, to, counter, the, korean, navy, eventually, admiral, wakizaka, completed, his, preparations, and, his, eagerness, to, win, military, honor, pushed, him, to, launch, an, attack, against, the, koreans, without, waiting, for, the, other, admirals, to, finish, the, combined, korean, navy, of, 70, ships, under, the, commands, of, admirals, yi, sun, sin, and, yi, eok, gi, was, carrying, out, a, search, and, destroy, operation, because, the, japanese, troops, on, land, were, advancing, into, jeolla, province, jeolla, province, was, the, only, korean, territory, to, be, untouched, by, a, major, military, action, and, served, as, home, for, the, three, admirals, and, the, only, active, korean, naval, force, the, admirals, considered, it, best, to, destroy, naval, support, for, the, japanese, to, reduce, the, effectiveness, of, the, enemy, ground, troops, on, august, 13, 1592, the, korean, fleet, sailing, from, miruk, island, at, dangpo, received, local, intelligence, that, a, large, japanese, fleet, was, nearby, the, following, morning, the, korean, fleet, spotted, the, japanese, fleet, of, 82, vessels, anchored, in, the, strait, of, gyeonnaeryang, because, of, the, narrowness, of, the, strait, and, the, hazard, posed, by, the, underwater, rocks, admiral, yi, sent, six, ships, to, lure, out, 63, japanese, vessels, into, the, wider, sea, and, the, japanese, fleet, followed, there, the, japanese, fleet, was, surrounded, by, the, korean, fleet, in, a, semicircular, formation, called, the, crane, wing, by, admiral, yi, with, at, least, three, turtle, ships, two, of, which, were, newly, completed, spearheading, the, clash, the, korean, vessels, fired, volleys, of, cannonballs, into, the, japanese, formation, then, the, korean, ships, engaged, in, a, free, for, all, battle, with, the, japanese, ships, maintaining, enough, distance, to, prevent, the, japanese, from, boarding, admiral, yi, permitted, melee, combat, only, against, severely, damaged, japanese, ships, the, battle, of, hansan, island, ended, in, a, korean, victory, with, japanese, losses, of, 59, ships, 47, destroyed, and, 12, captured, several, korean, prisoners, of, war, were, rescued, during, the, fight, admiral, wakisaka, escaped, due, to, the, speed, of, his, flagship, when, the, news, of, the, defeat, reached, toyotomi, hideyoshi, he, ordered, that, the, japanese, invasion, forces, cease, all, naval, operations, on, august, 16, 1592, yi, sun, sin, led, the, fleet, to, the, harbor, of, angolpo, where, 42, japanese, vessels, were, docked, in, september, 1592, yi, left, his, base, at, hansan, island, and, attacked, the, japanese, in, busan, harbor, yi, withdrew, his, forces, from, busan, harbor, after, the, battle, due, to, the, absence, of, a, landing, force, in, 1593, admiral, yi, was, appointed, to, command, the, combined, navies, of, the, three, southern, provinces, with, the, title, naval, commander, of, the, three, provinces, which, gave, him, command, over, the, right, and, left, navies, of, jeolla, province, the, right, and, left, navies, of, gyeongsang, province, and, the, navy, of, chungcheong, province, one, of, yi, s, greatest, accomplishments, was, resurrecting, and, improving, the, turtle, ship, with, his, creative, mind, and, the, support, of, his, subordinates, yi, was, able, to, devise, the, geobukseon, or, turtle, ship, contrary, to, popular, belief, the, turtle, ship, was, not, actually, invented, by, admiral, yi, rather, he, improved, upon, an, older, design, that, had, been, suggested, during, the, reign, of, king, taejong, the, turtle, ships, designed, by, yi, held, eleven, cannons, on, each, side, of, the, ship, with, two, each, at, the, stern, and, the, bow, the, ship, s, figurehead, was, in, the, shape, of, a, dragon, the, figurehead, itself, held, up, to, four, cannons, and, emitted, a, smokescreen, that, in, combination, with, its, fierce, appearance, was, meant, to, be, used, as, psychological, warfare, the, sides, of, the, turtle, ship, were, dotted, with, smaller, holes, from, which, arrows, guns, and, mortars, could, be, fired, the, roof, was, covered, with, planks, and, spikes, the, purpose, of, the, spikes, was, to, prevent, the, ship, from, being, boarded, by, the, enemy, the, larger, japanese, ships, sides, were, higher, than, the, turtle, ships, and, thus, the, spikes, prevented, boarders, from, jumping, down, onto, the, roof, without, risking, impalement, there, were, two, masts, that, held, two, large, sails, the, turtle, ship, was, also, steered, and, powered, by, twenty, oars, each, of, which, were, pulled, by, two, men, during, fair, conditions, and, five, in, foul, seas, or, combat, there, is, a, continuing, debate, as, to, whether, the, turtle, ship, had, two, decks, or, three, historians, still, have, no, definitive, answer, whichever, is, the, case, it, is, clear, that, the, turtle, ship, employed, multiple, decks, to, separate, the, rowers, from, the, combat, compartment, this, enabled, the, turtle, ship, to, be, very, mobile, since, wind, and, manpower, could, be, used, simultaneously, most, support, the, argument, of, two, decks, since, that, was, what, was, drawn, out, in, the, first, and, second, designs, of, the, turtle, ships, some, historians, maintain, that, since, yi, was, a, unique, individual, and, often, pursued, innovative, ideas, contrary, to, the, established, wisdom, of, his, peers, it, is, possible, that, he, had, the, turtle, ship, built, with, three, decks, it, is, known, that, his, flagship, a, panokseon, had, three, decks, during, his, campaigns, so, there, is, support, for, the, belief, that, the, turtle, ship, had, three, decks, turtle, ships, were, the, most, famous, part, of, admiral, yi, s, fleet, however, he, never, deployed, more, than, five, in, any, one, battle, joseon, used, cannons, as, its, primary, offensive, naval, weapon, historically, they, had, often, used, guns, and, cannons, against, japanese, pirates, as, early, as, the, 1390s, the, joseon, navy, did, not, implement, the, ship, boarding, strategy, that, the, japanese, navy, did, so, it, was, imperative, that, their, warships, stand, off, from, japanese, vessels, admiral, yi, made, it, a, strategic, priority, to, avoid, hand, to, hand, combat, in, which, the, japanese, navy, specialized, the, turtle, ship, was, developed, to, support, his, tactic, against, japanese, fleets, turtle, ships, were, first, used, in, the, 1592, battle, of, sacheon, and, were, used, in, nearly, every, battle, until, the, devastating, battle, of, chilchonryang, when, a, japanese, double, agent, plot, nearly, succeeded, resulting, in, every, turtle, ship, and, all, but, 13, panokseon, being, sunk, the, turtle, ships, did, not, re, appear, in, battle, until, the, battle, of, noryang, turtle, ships, were, mostly, used, to, spearhead, attacks, they, were, best, used, in, tight, areas, and, around, islands, rather, than, the, open, sea, one, day, he, told, general, kim, gyeong, seo, that, the, japanese, general, kat, kiyomasa, would, be, coming, on, a, certain, date, with, a, great, fleet, for, another, attack, on, the, south, shores, and, insisted, that, admiral, yi, be, sent, to, lay, an, ambush, general, kim, agreed, and, sent, the, message, to, field, marshal, gwon, yul, 1537, 1599, commander, in, chief, of, the, joseon, military, who, in, turn, sent, the, message, to, king, seonjo, king, seonjo, who, was, desperate, for, victories, to, loosen, the, japanese, grip, on, his, kingdom, gave, permission, for, the, attack, when, general, kim, gave, admiral, yi, his, orders, the, admiral, refused, to, carry, them, out, for, he, knew, that, the, location, given, was, studded, with, sunken, rocks, and, was, thus, extremely, dangerous, admiral, yi, also, refused, because, he, did, not, trust, the, words, when, general, kim, informed, the, king, of, admiral, yi, s, refusal, the, admiral, s, enemies, at, court, quickly, insisted, on, his, replacement, by, general, won, gyun, former, commander, of, the, gyeongsang, province, western, fleet, commander, of, the, jeolla, province, ground, forces, they, advised, that, admiral, yi, be, arrested, as, a, result, in, 1597, yi, was, relieved, of, command, placed, under, arrest, and, taken, to, seoul, in, chains, to, be, imprisoned, and, tortured, yi, was, tortured, almost, to, the, point, of, death, by, using, simple, torture, tactics, such, as, whipping, flogging, burning, the, cudgel, or, even, the, classic, technique, of, leg, breaking, torture, king, seonjo, wanted, to, have, yi, killed, but, the, admiral, s, supporters, at, court, chiefly, the, minister, jeong, tak, 1526, 1605, convinced, the, king, to, spare, him, due, to, his, past, service, record, the, prime, minister, yu, seong, ryong, who, was, yi, s, childhood, friend, and, his, main, supporter, remained, silent, during, this, deadly, hour, spared, the, death, penalty, admiral, yi, was, again, demoted, to, the, rank, of, a, common, infantry, soldier, under, general, gwon, yul, this, penalty, was, worse, than, death, for, joseon, generals, at, that, time, since, they, lived, by, honor, however, yi, responded, to, this, humiliation, as, a, most, obedient, subject, quietly, going, about, his, work, as, if, his, rank, and, orders, were, appropriate, despite, his, low, rank, many, officers, treated, him, with, respect, since, they, knew, that, the, admiral, did, nothing, wrong, yi, would, stay, under, general, gwon, yul, s, command, for, a, short, while, until, won, gyun, s, death, at, the, battle, of, chilchonryang, which, would, lead, to, his, reinstatement, with, yi, stripped, of, influence, and, negotiations, breaking, down, in, 1596, hideyoshi, again, ordered, an, attack, on, joseon, the, second, japanese, invasion, landed, in, the, first, month, of, 1597, with, a, force, of, 140, 000, men, transported, on, 1000, ships, in, response, ming, china, sent, thousands, of, reinforcements, to, aid, joseon, with, the, help, of, the, ming, the, joseon, army, was, able, to, halt, the, japanese, offensive, and, push, it, back, during, the, winter, of, 1597, before, the, japanese, were, able, to, reach, the, joseon, capitol, of, hanseong, on, the, high, seas, yi, s, successor, won, gyun, failed, to, respond, to, reports, from, his, scouts, and, allowed, the, japanese, to, land, critical, reinforcements, at, sosang, harbor, for, their, land, offensive, unopposed, without, adequate, reconnaissance, or, planning, won, gyun, decided, to, attack, with, the, entire, naval, force, of, joseon, at, his, disposal, a, fleet, consisting, of, 150, warships, operated, by, 30, 000, men, that, had, been, carefully, assembled, and, trained, by, admiral, yi, won, gyun, left, anchor, at, yeosu, with, the, fleet, and, sailed, into, waters, marked, by, treacherous, rocks, where, the, japanese, ambushed, the, joseon, fleet, in, the, battle, of, chilchonryang, on, august, 28, 1597, ignorant, of, the, strength, and, disposition, of, the, enemy, won, was, stunned, to, find, a, japanese, fleet, of, 500, to, 1000, ships, which, immediately, closed, for, melee, combat, denying, the, joseon, ships, the, advantages, of, superior, seamanship, and, cannon, fire, the, exhausted,

would, mean, unrestricted, movement, of, supplies, and, reinforcements, from, japan, for, the, offensive, drive, on, land, towards, hanseong, and, beyond, after, careful, study, of, potential, battlefields, in, october, 1597, admiral, yi, lured, the, japanese, fleet, into, the, myeongnyang, strait, by, sending, a, fast, warship, near, the, japanese, naval, base, and, luring, the, japanese, fleet, out, of, anchorage, the, japanese, assumed, that, this, was, a, joseon, scouting, ship, and, that, pursuing, it, would, lead, to, the, location, of, admiral, yi, giving, them, an, opportunity, to, destroy, the, remnants, of, the, joseon, fleet, what, they, did, not, know, was, that, they, were, being, lured, into, a, masterfully, devised, trap, there, were, several, reasons, why, admiral, yi, decided, on, this, location, for, battle, myeongnyang, strait, had, currents, eddies, and, whirlpools, so, powerful, that, ships, could, only, enter, safely, a, few, at, a, time, the, north, south, tidal, flow, reversed, every, three, hours, limiting, the, time, that, the, japanese, could, mount, an, offensive, the, strait, was, sufficiently, narrow, that, it, would, prove, impossible, for, the, japanese, to, flank, or, envelop, the, numerically, inferior, joseon, fleet, the, deep, shadows, of, the, surrounding, hillsides, provided, the, joseon, ships, with, concealment, on, that, particular, day, there, was, also, a, heavy, mist, dramatically, reducing, visibility, in, favor, of, the, joseon, fleet, therefore, despite, being, vastly, outnumbered, admiral, yi, used, the, terrain, restrictions, to, neutralize, the, japanese, navy, s, staggering, numerical, advantage, the, japanese, fleet, of, approximately, 333, ships, 133, warships, at, least, 200, logistical, support, ships, entered, myeongnyang, strait, in, groups, the, japanese, ships, that, made, it, through, were, met, by, 13, joseon, warships, obscured, by, the, shadows, of, the, surrounding, hills, ready, with, archers, and, cannons, and, the, melee, based, japanese, found, themselves, unable, to, fight, effectively, and, break, through, the, superior, joseon, ranged, fire, the, unpredictable, current, eventually, wreaked, havoc, on, the, japanese, their, ships, found, themselves, unable, to, maneuver, and, collided, with, each, other, when, the, tide, reversed, while, also, presenting, a, perfect, target, for, the, joseon, naval, artillery, admiral, yi, was, astonishingly, able, to, rout, a, force, that, outnumbered, him, more, than, 25, to, 1, in, ships, alone, about, 31, of, the, 333, japanese, ships, that, entered, the, myeongnyang, strait, were, destroyed, or, damaged, joseon, losses, on, the, other, hand, were, around, ten, casualties, and, no, ships, lost, kurushima, michifusa, was, killed, on, his, flagship, by, joseon, archers, his, body, in, its, ornate, armor, was, fished, out, of, the, water, and, his, severed, head, was, put, on, display, to, further, demoralize, the, japanese, fleet, on, december, 15, 1598, a, huge, japanese, fleet, under, the, command, of, shimazu, yoshihiro, was, amassed, in, sachon, bay, on, the, east, end, of, noryang, strait, shimazu, s, goal, was, to, break, the, allied, forces, blockade, on, konishi, yukinaga, join, the, two, fleets, and, sail, home, to, japan, admiral, yi, meanwhile, knew, exactly, where, shimazu, was, after, receiving, reports, from, scouts, and, local, fishermen, at, this, time, the, joseon, fleet, consisted, of, 82, panokseon, and, three, turtle, ships, with, 8, 000, soldiers, under, admiral, yi, the, ming, fleet, consisted, of, six, large, war, junks, 57, lighter, war, galleys, and, two, panokseon, given, to, chen, lin, by, admiral, yi, with, 5, 000, ming, soldiers, of, the, guangdong, squadron, and, 2, 600, ming, marines, who, fought, aboard, joseon, ships, the, battle, began, at, two, o, clock, in, the, early, morning, of, december, 16, 1598, like, admiral, yi, s, previous, battles, the, japanese, were, unable, to, respond, effectively, to, the, korean, s, tactics, the, tightness, of, noryang, strait, hindered, lateral, movement, and, yi, s, maneuvers, prevented, the, japanese, fleet, from, boarding, their, enemies, vessels, their, primary, naval, tactic, as, the, japanese, retreated, admiral, yi, ordered, a, vigorous, pursuit, during, this, time, a, stray, arquebus, bullet, from, an, enemy, ship, struck, admiral, yi, near, his, left, armpit, sensing, that, the, wound, was, fatal, and, fearing, a, repeat, of, the, battle, of, chilchonryang, the, admiral, uttered, the, war, is, at, its, height, wear, my, armor, and, beat, my, war, drums, do, not, announce, my, death, he, died, moments, later, only, two, people, witnessed, his, death, yi, hoe, yi, s, eldest, son, and, yi, wan, his, nephew, admiral, yi, s, son, and, nephew, struggled, to, regain, their, composure, and, carried, the, admiral, s, body, into, his, cabin, before, others, could, notice, for, the, remainder, of, the, battle, yi, wan, wore, his, uncle, s, armor, and, continued, to, beat, the, war, drum, to, encourage, the, pursuit, during, the, battle, chen, lin, and, yi, were, friends, and, allies, who, helped, and, rescued, each, other, several, times, when, chen, lin, called, for, admiral, yi, to, thank, him, for, coming, to, his, aid, he, was, met, by, yi, wan, who, announced, that, his, uncle, was, dead, it, is, said, that, chen, himself, was, so, shocked, that, he, fell, to, the, ground, three, times, beating, his, chest, and, crying, news, of, admiral, yi, s, death, spread, quickly, throughout, the, allied, fleet, and, both, joseon, and, ming, sailors, and, fighting, men, wailed, in, grief, chen, lin, later, reported, the, news, of, yi, s, death, to, wanli, emperor, where, he, bestowed, gifts, and, eulogies, on, chen, and, yi, since, then, yi, and, chen, were, memorialized, as, national, heroes, in, korea, chen, s, descendants, were, later, welcomed, back, to, korea, to, start, the, gwangdong, jin, clan, because, of, chen, lin, s, contributions, in, defeating, the, japanese, and, his, camaraderie, with, yi, sunsin, admiral, yi, s, body, was, brought, back, to, his, hometown, in, asan, to, be, buried, next, to, his, father, yi, jeong, in, accordance, to, korean, tradition, shrines, both, official, and, unofficial, were, constructed, in, his, honor, all, throughout, the, land, some, say, yi, is, an, exemplar, of, conduct, for, both, koreans, and, even, japanese, some, military, historians, like, joseph, cummins, and, george, alexander, ballard, place, yi, on, par, with, admiral, horatio, nelson, as, one, of, the, greatest, naval, commanders, in, history, admiral, george, alexander, ballard, of, the, royal, navy, compared, yi, to, lord, nelson, of, england, it, is, always, difficult, for, englishmen, to, admit, that, nelson, ever, had, an, equal, in, his, profession, but, if, any, man, is, entitled, to, be, so, regarded, it, should, be, this, great, naval, commander, of, asiatic, race, who, never, knew, defeat, and, died, in, the, presence, of, the, enemy, of, whose, movements, a, track, chart, might, be, compiled, from, the, wrecks, of, hundreds, of, japanese, ships, lying, with, their, valiant, crews, at, the, bottom, of, the, sea, off, the, coasts, of, the, korean, peninsula, and, it, seems, in, truth, no, exaggeration, to, assert, that, from, first, to, last, he, never, made, a, mistake, for, his, work, was, so, complete, under, each, variety, of, circumstances, as, to, defy, criticism, his, whole, career, might, be, summarized, by, saying, that, although, he, had, no, lessons, from, history, to, serve, as, a, guide, he, waged, war, on, the, sea, as, it, should, be, waged, if, it, is, to, produce, definite, results, and, ended, by, making, the, supreme, sacrifice, of, a, defender, of, his, country, the, influence, of, the, sea, on, the, political, history, of, japan, pp, 66, 67, admiral, togo, regarded, admiral, yi, as, his, superior, at, a, party, held, in, his, honor, togo, took, exception, to, a, speech, comparing, him, to, lord, nelson, and, yi, sun, sin, it, may, be, proper, to, compare, me, with, nelson, but, not, with, korea, s, yi, sun, sin, for, he, has, no, equal, the, imjin, war, by, samuel, hawley, pg, 490, prior, to, the, 1905, battle, of, tsushima, lieutenant, commander, kawada, isao, recalled, in, his, memoirs, that, naturally, we, could, not, help, but, remind, ourselves, of, korea, s, yi, sun, sin, the, world, s, first, sea, commander, whose, superlative, personality, strategy, invention, commanding, ability, intelligence, and, courage, were, all, worthy, of, our, admiration, the, imjin, war, by, samuel, hawley, pg, 490, admiral,

tactics, of, frontal, attack, sudden, attack, concentration, and, dilation, napoleon, who, mastered, the, art, of, conquering, the, part, with, the, whole, can, be, held, to, have, been, such, a, general, and, among, admirals, two, further, tactical, geniuses, may, be, named, in, the, east, yi, sun, sin, of, korea, and, in, the, west, horatio, nelson, of, england, undoubtedly, yi, is, a, supreme, naval, commander, even, on, the, basis, of, the, limited, literature, of, the, seven, year, war, and, despite, the, fact, that, his, bravery, and, brilliance, are, not, known, to, the, west, since, he, had, the, misfortune, to, be, born, in, joseon, period, anyone, who, can, be, compared, to, yi, should, be, better, than, michiel, de, ruyter, from, netherlands, nelson, is, far, behind,
