vietnamese, imperial, palace, in, thang, long, for, nearly, one, fourth, of, a, century, after, years, of, serving, the, vietnamese, as, a, eunuch, slave, in, the, palace, he, was, promoted, to, a, position, with, real, power, after, the, death, of, the, vietnamese, ruler, in, 1497, to, a, military, position, in, northern, vietnam, as, military, superintendent, since, his, service, in, the,

100, men, were, taken, prisoner, around, the, same, time, as, wu, rui, and, the, historian, leo, k, shin, believes, all, of, them, may, have, been, involved, in, illegal, trade, instead, of, being,
