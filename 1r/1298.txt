daughter, of, king, vladislaus, ii, of, hungary, and, bohemia, on, 22, july, 1515, both, hungary, and, bohemia, were, elective, monarchies, where, the, parliaments, had, the, sovereign, right, to, decide, about, the, person, of, the, king, therefore, after, the, death, of, his, brother, in, law, louis, ii, of, hungary, and, bohemia, at, the, battle, of, moh, cs, on, 29, august, 1526, ferdinand, immediately, applied, to, the, parliaments, of, hungary, and, bohemia, to, participate, as, a, candidate, in, the, royal, elections, on, 24, october, 1526, the, bohemian, diet, acting, under, the, influence, of, chancellor, adam, of, hradce, elected, ferdinand, king, of, bohemia, under, conditions, of, confirming, traditional, privileges, of, the, estates, and, also, moving, the, habsburg, court, to, prague, the, success, was, only, partial, as, the, diet, refused, to, recognise, ferdinand, as, hereditary, lord, of, the, kingdom, the, throne, of, hungary, became, the, subject, of, a, dynastic, dispute, between, ferdinand, and, john, z, polya, voivode, of, transylvania, they, were, supported, by, different, factions, of, the, nobility, in, the, hungarian, kingdom, ferdinand, also, had, the, support, of, his, brother, the, emperor, charles, v, on, 10, november, 1526, john, z, polya, was, proclaimed, king, by, a, diet, at, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, elected, in, the, parliament, by, the, untitled, lesser, nobility, gentry, nicolaus, olahus, secretary, of, louis, attached, himself, to, the, party, of, ferdinand, but, retained, his, position, with, his, sister, queen, dowager, mary, ferdinand, was, also, elected, king, of, hungary, dalmatia, croatia, slavonia, etc, by, the, higher, aristocracy, the, magnates, or, barons, and, the, hungarian, catholic, clergy, in, a, rump, diet, in, pozsony, bratislava, in, slovak, on, 17, december, 1526, accordingly, ferdinand, was, crowned, as, king, of, hungary, in, the, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, basilica, on, 3, november, 1527, the, croatian, nobles, unanimously, accepted, the, pozsony, election, of, ferdinand, i, receiving, him, as, their, king, in, the, 1527, election, in, cetin, and, confirming, the, succession, to, him, and, his, heirs, in, return, for, the, throne, king, ferdinand, promised, to, respect, the, historic, rights, freedoms, laws, and, customs, of, the, croats, when, they, united, with, the, hungarian, kingdom, and, to, defend, croatia, from, ottoman, invasion, brendan, simms, notes, that, the, reason, ferdinand, was, able, to, gain, this, sphere, of, power, was, charles, v, s, difficulties, in, coordinating, between, the, austrian, hungarian, fronts, and, his, mediterranean, fronts, in, the, face, of, the, ottoman, threat, as, well, as, in, his, german, burgundian, and, italian, theatres, of, war, against, german, protestant, princes, and, france, thus, the, defense, of, central, europe, was, subcontracted, to, ferdinand, as, well, as, many, responsibilities, involving, the, management, of, the, empire, charles, v, abdicated, as, archduke, of, austria, 1522, and, nine, years, after, that, he, had, the, german, princes, elect, ferdinand, as, king, of, the, romans, who, thus, became, his, designated, successor, this, had, profound, implications, for, state, formation, in, south, eastern, europe, ferdinand, rescued, bohemia, and, silesia, from, the, hungarian, wreckage, making, his, north, eastern, flank, more, secure, he, told, the, austrian, landtag, the, assembled, representatives, of, the, nobility, at, linz, in, 1530, that, the, turks, cannot, be, resisted, unless, the, kingdom, of, hungary, was, in, the, hands, of, an, archduke, of, austria, or, another, german, prince, after, some, hesitation, croatia, and, the, hungarian, rump, joined, the, habsburgs, in, both, cases, the, link, was, essentially, a, contractual, one, directly, linked, to, ferdinand, s, ability, to, provide, protection, against, the, turks, the, austrian, lands, were, in, miserable, economic, and, financial, conditions, but, ferdinand, was, forced, to, introduce, the, so, called, turkish, tax, t, rken, steuer, in, view, of, the, ottoman, threat, in, spite, of, the, huge, austrian, sacrifices, he, was, not, able, to, collect, enough, money, to, pay, for, the, expenses, of, the, defence, costs, of, austrian, lands, his, annual, revenues, only, allowed, him, to, hire, 5, 000, mercenaries, for, two, months, thus, ferdinand, asked, for, help, from, his, brother, emperor, charles, v, and, started, to, borrow, money, from, rich, bankers, like, the, fugger, family, ferdinand, defeated, z, polya, at, the, battle, of, tarcal, in, september, 1527, and, again, in, the, battle, of, szina, in, march, 1528, z, polya, fled, the, country, and, applied, to, sultan, suleiman, the, magnificent, for, support, making, hungary, an, ottoman, vassal, state, this, led, to, the, most, dangerous, moment, of, ferdinand, s, career, in, 1529, when, suleiman, took, advantage, of, this, hungarian, support, for, a, massive, but, ultimately, unsuccessful, assault, on, ferdinand, s, capital, the, siege, of, vienna, which, sent, ferdinand, to, refuge, in, bohemia, a, further, ottoman, invasion, was, repelled, in, 1532, see, siege, of, g, ns, in, that, year, ferdinand, made, peace, with, the, ottomans, splitting, hungary, into, a, habsburg, sector, in, the, west, royal, hungary, and, john, z, polya, s, domain, in, the, east, eastern, hungarian, kingdom, the, latter, effectively, a, vassal, state, of, the, ottoman, empire, together, with, the, formation, of, the, schmalkaldic, league, in, 1531, this, struggle, with, the, ottomans, caused, ferdinand, to, grant, the, nuremberg, religious, peace, as, long, as, he, hoped, for, a, favorable, response, from, his, humiliating, overtures, to, suleiman, ferdinand, was, not, inclined, to, grant, the, peace, which, the, protestants, demanded, at, the, diet, of, regensburg, which, met, in, april, 1532, but, as, the, army, of, suleiman, drew, nearer, he, yielded, and, on, 23, july, 1532, the, peace, was, concluded, at, nuremberg, where, the, final, deliberations, took, place, those, who, had, up, to, this, time, joined, the, reformation, obtained, religious, liberty, until, the, meeting, of, a, council, and, in, a, separate, compact, all, proceedings, in, matters, of, religion, pending, before, the, imperial, chamber, court, were, temporarily, paused, in, 1538, in, the, treaty, of, nagyv, rad, ferdinand, induced, the, childless, z, polya, to, name, him, as, his, successor, but, in, 1540, just, before, his, death, z, polya, had, a, son, john, ii, sigismund, who, was, promptly, elected, king, by, the, diet, ferdinand, invaded, hungary, but, the, regent, frater, george, martinuzzi, bishop, of, v, rad, called, on, the, ottomans, for, protection, suleiman, marched, into, hungary, see, siege, of, buda, 1541, and, not, only, drove, ferdinand, out, of, central, hungary, he, forced, ferdinand, to, agree, to, pay, tribute, for, his, lands, in, western, hungary, john, ii, sigismund, was, also, supported, by, king, sigismund, i, of, poland, his, mother, s, father, but, in, 1543, sigismund, made, a, treaty, with, the, habsburgs, and, poland, became, neutral, prince, sigismund, augustus, married, archduchess, elisabeth, of, austria, ferdinand, s, daughter, suleiman, had, allocated, transylvania, and, eastern, royal, hungary, to, john, ii, sigismund, which, became, the, eastern, hungarian, kingdom, reigned, over, by, his, mother, isabella, jagiellon, with, martinuzzi, as, the, real, power, but, isabella, s, hostile, intrigues, and, threats, from, the, ottomans, led, martinuzzi, to, switch, round, in, 1549, he, agreed, to, support, ferdinand, s, claim, and, imperial, armies, marched, into, transylvania, in, the, treaty, of, weissenburg, 1551, isabella, agreed, on, behalf, of, john, ii, sigismund, to, abdicate, as, king, of, hungary, and, to, hand, over, the, holy, crown, of, hungary, and, regalia, thus, royal, hungary, and, transylvania, went, to, ferdinand, who, agreed, to, recognise, john, ii, sigismund, as, vassal, prince, of, transylvania, and, betrothed, one, of, his, daughters, to, him, meanwhile, martinuzzi, attempted, to, keep, the, ottomans, happy, even, after, they, responded, by, sending, troops, ferdinand, s, general, castaldo, suspected, martinuzzi, of, treason, and, with, ferdinand, s, approval, had, him, killed, since, martinuzzi, was, by, this, time, an, archbishop, and, cardinal, this, was, a, shocking, act, and, pope, julius, iii, excommunicated, castaldo, and, ferdinand, ferdinand, sent, the, pope, a, long, accusation, of, treason, against, martinuzzi, in, 87, articles, supported, by, 116, witnesses, the, pope, exonerated, ferdinand, and, lifted, the, excommunications, in, 1555, the, war, in, hungary, continued, ferdinand, was, unable, to, keep, the, ottomans, out, of, hungary, in, 1554, ferdinand, sent, ogier, ghiselin, de, busbecq, to, constantinople, to, discuss, a, border, treaty, with, suleiman, but, he, could, achieve, nothing, in, 1556, the, diet, returned, john, ii, sigismund, to, the, eastern, hungarian, throne, where, he, remained, until, 1570, de, busbecq, returned, to, constantinople, in, 1556, and, succeeded, on, his, second, try, the, austrian, branch, of, habsburg, monarchs, needed, the, economic, power, of, hungary, for, the, ottoman, wars, during, the, ottoman, wars, the, territory, of, the, former, kingdom, of, hungary, shrank, by, around, seventy, percent, despite, these, enormous, territorial, and, demographic, losses, the, smaller, heavily, war, torn, royal, hungary, had, remained, economically, more, important, to, the, habsburg, rulers, than, austria, or, kingdom, of, bohemia, even, at, the, end, of, the, 16th, century, out, of, all, his, countries, the, depleted, kingdom, of, hungary, was, at, that, time, ferdinand, s, largest, source, of, revenue, when, he, took, control, of, the, bohemian, lands, in, the, 1520s, their, religious, situation, was, complex, its, german, population, was, composed, of, catholics, and, lutherans, some, czechs, were, receptive, to, lutheranism, but, most, of, them, adhered, to, utraquist, hussitism, while, a, minority, of, them, adhered, to, roman, catholicism, a, significant, number, of, utraquists, favoured, an, alliance, with, the, protestants, at, first, ferdinand, accepted, this, situation, and, he, gave, considerable, freedom, to, the, bohemian, estates, in, the, 1540s, the, situation, changed, in, germany, while, most, protestant, princes, had, hitherto, favored, negotiation, with, the, emperor, and, while, many, had, supported, him, in, his, wars, they, became, increasingly, confrontational, during, this, decade, some, of, them, even, went, to, war, against, the, emperor, and, many, bohemian, german, or, czech, protestants, or, utraquists, sympathized, with, them, ferdinand, and, his, son, maximilian, participated, in, the, victorious, campaign, of, charles, v, against, the, german, protestants, in, 1547, the, same, year, he, also, defeated, a, protestant, revolt, in, bohemia, where, the, estates, and, a, large, part, of, the, nobility, had, denied, him, support, in, the, german, campaign, this, allowed, him, to, increase, his, power, in, this, realm, he, centralized, his, administration, revoked, many, urban, privileges, and, confiscated, properties, ferdinand, also, sought, to, strengthen, the, position, of, the, catholic, church, in, the, bohemian, lands, and, favoured, the, installation, of, the, jesuits, there, in, the, 1550s, ferdinand, managed, to, win, some, key, victories, on, the, imperial, scene, unlike, his, brother, he, opposed, albert, alcibiades, margrave, of, brandenburg, kulmbach, and, participated, in, his, defeat, this, defeat, along, with, his, german, ways, made, ferdinand, more, popular, than, the, emperor, among, protestant, princes, this, allowed, him, to, play, a, critical, role, in, the, settlement, of, the, religious, issue, in, the, empire, after, decades, of, religious, and, political, unrest, in, the, german, states, charles, v, ordered, a, general, diet, in, augsburg, at, which, the, various, states, would, discuss, the, religious, problem, and, its, solution, charles, himself, did, not, attend, and, delegated, authority, to, his, brother, ferdinand, to, act, and, settle, disputes, of, territory, religion, and, local, power, at, the, conference, which, opened, on, 5, february, ferdinand, cajoled, persuaded, and, threatened, the, various, representatives, into, agreement, on, three, important, principles, promulgated, on, 25, september, after, 1555, the, peace, of, augsburg, became, the, legitimating, legal, document, governing, the, co, existence, of, the, lutheran, and, catholic, faiths, in, the, german, lands, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, it, served, to, ameliorate, many, of, the, tensions, between, followers, of, the, old, faith, catholicism, and, the, followers, of, luther, but, it, had, two, fundamental, flaws, first, ferdinand, had, rushed, the, article, on, reservatum, ecclesiasticum, through, the, debate, it, had, not, undergone, the, scrutiny, and, discussion, that, attended, the, widespread, acceptance, and, support, of, cuius, regio, eius, religio, consequently, its, wording, did, not, cover, all, or, even, most, potential, legal, scenarios, the, declaratio, ferdinandei, was, not, debated, in, plenary, session, at, all, using, his, authority, to, act, and, settle, ferdinand, had, added, it, at, the, last, minute, responding, to, lobbying, by, princely, families, and, knights, while, these, specific, failings, came, back, to, haunt, the, empire, in, subsequent, decades, perhaps, the, greatest, weakness, of, the, peace, of, augsburg, was, its, failure, to, take, into, account, the, growing, diversity, of, religious, expression, emerging, in, the, so, called, evangelical, and, reformed, traditions, other, confessions, had, acquired, popular, if, not, legal, legitimacy, in, the, intervening, decades, and, by, 1555, the, reforms, proposed, by, luther, were, no, longer, the, only, possibilities, of, religious, expression, anabaptists, such, as, the, frisian, menno, simons, 1492, 1559, and, his, followers, the, followers, of, john, calvin, who, were, particularly, strong, in, the, southwest, and, the, northwest, and, the, followers, of, huldrych, zwingli, were, excluded, from, considerations, and, protections, under, the, peace, of, augsburg, according, to, the, augsburg, agreement, their, religious, beliefs, remained, heretical, in, 1556, amid, great, pomp, and, leaning, on, the, shoulder, of, one, of, his, favourites, the, 24, year, old, william, the, silent, charles, gave, away, his, lands, and, his, offices, the, spanish, empire, which, included, spain, the, habsburg, netherlands, kingdom, of, naples, duchy, of, milan, and, spain, s, possessions, in, the, americas, went, to, his, son, philip, ferdinand, became, suo, jure, monarch, in, austria, and, succeeded, charles, as, holy, roman, emperor, this, course, of, events, had, been, guaranteed, already, on, 5, january, 1531, when, ferdinand, had, been, elected, the, king, of, the, romans, and, so, the, legitimate, successor, of, the, reigning, emperor, charles, s, choices, were, appropriate, philip, was, culturally, spanish, he, was, born, in, valladolid, and, raised, in, the, spanish, court, his, native, tongue, was, spanish, and, he, preferred, to, live, in, spain, ferdinand, was, familiar, with, and, to, the, other, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, although, he, too, had, been, born, in, spain, he, had, administered, his, brother, s, affairs, in, the, empire, since, 1531, some, historians, maintain, ferdinand, had, also, been, touched, by, the, reformed, philosophies, and, was, probably, the, closest, the, holy, roman, empire, ever, came, to, a, protestant, emperor, he, remained, nominally, a, catholic, throughout, his, life, although, reportedly, he, refused, last, rites, on, his, deathbed, other, historians, maintain, he, was, as, catholic, as, his, brother, but, tended, to, see, religion, as, outside, the, political, sphere, charles, abdication, had, far, reaching, consequences, in, imperial, diplomatic, relations, with, france, and, the, netherlands, particularly, in, his, allotment, of, the, spanish, kingdom, to, philip, in, france, the, kings, and, their, ministers, grew, increasingly, uneasy, about, habsburg, encirclement, and, sought, allies, against, habsburg, hegemony, from, among, the, border, german, territories, and, even, from, some, of, the, protestant, kings, in, the, netherlands, philip, s, ascension, in, spain, raised, particular, problems, for, the, sake, of, harmony, order, and, prosperity, charles, had, not, blocked, the, reformation, and, had, tolerated, a, high, level, of, local, autonomy, an, ardent, catholic, and, rigidly, autocratic, prince, philip, pursued, an, aggressive, political, economic, and, religious, policy, toward, the, dutch, resulting, in, a, dutch, rebellion, shortly, after, he, became, king, philip, s, militant, response, meant, the, occupation, of, much, of, the, upper, provinces, by, troops, of, or, hired, by, habsburg, spain, and, the, constant, ebb, and, flow, of, spanish, men, and, provisions, on, the, so, called, spanish, road, from, northern, italy, through, the, franche, comt, to, and, from, flanders, charles, abdicated, as, emperor, in, august, 1556, in, favor, of, his, brother, ferdinand, given, the, settlement, of, 1521, and, the, election, of, 1531, ferdinand, became, holy, roman, emperor, and, suo, jure, archduke, of, austria, due, to, lengthy, debate, and, bureaucratic, procedure, the, imperial, diet, did, not, accept, the, imperial, succession, until, 3, may, 1558, the, pope, refused, to, recognize, ferdinand, as, emperor, until, 1559, when, peace, was, reached, between, france, and, the, habsburgs, during, his, reign, the, council, of, trent, came, to, an, end, ferdinand, organized, an, imperial, election, in, 1562, in, order, to, secure, the, succession, of, his, son, maximilian, ii, venetian, ambassadors, to, ferdinand, recall, in, their, relazioni, the, emperor, s, pragmatism, and, his, ability, to, speak, multiple, languages, several, issues, of, the, council, of, trent, were, solved, after, a, compromise, was, personally, reached, between, emperor, ferdinand, and, morone, the, papal, legate, an, important, invention, of, ferdinand, was, the, hofkriegsrat, aulic, war, council, officially, established, in, 1556, to, coordinate, military, affairs, in, all, habsburg, lands, inside, and, outside, the, holy, roman, empire, together, with, the, reichshofkanzlei, established, in, 1559, merging, the, imperial, and, austrian, chancelleries, thus, also, dealing, with, affairs, of, both, imperial, and, habsburg, lands, and, the, hofkammer, the, finance, chamber, which, received, imperial, taxes, from, the, reichspfennig, meister, it, formed, the, core, of, the, habsburg, government, in, vienna, the, reichshofrat, was, revived, to, deal, with, affairs, concerning, imperial, prerogatives, in, 1556, an, ordinance, was, issued, to, ensure, imperial, and, dynastic, affairs, were, managed, separately, by, two, groups, of, officials, from, the, same, institution, though, in, his, time, the, influence, of, the, estates, in, these, institutions, were, limited, for, each, l, nder, group, regiments, or, governments, and, treasury, offices, were, created, unlike, maximilian, i, and, charles, v, ferdinand, i, was, not, a, nomadic, ruler, in, 1533, he, moved, his, residence, to, vienna, and, spent, most, of, his, time, there, after, experiencing, the, turkish, siege, of, 1529, ferdinand, worked, hard, to, make, vienna, an, impregnable, fortress, after, his, 1558, accession, vienna, became, the, imperial, capital, since, 1542, charles, v, and, ferdinand, had, been, able, to, collect, the, common, penny, tax, or, t, rkenhilfe, turkish, aid, designed, to, protect, the, empire, against, the, ottomans, or, france, but, as, hungary, unlike, bohemia, was, not, part, of, the, empire, the, imperial, aid, for, hungary, depended, on, political, factors, the, obligation, was, only, in, effect, if, vienna, or, the, empire, was, threatened, the, western, part, of, hungary, over, which, ferdinand, had, dominion, became, known, as, royal, hungary, as, the, ruler, of, austria, bohemia, and, royal, hungary, ferdinand, adopted, a, policy, of, centralisation, and, in, common, with, other, monarchs, of, the, time, the, construction, of, an, absolute, monarchy, in, 1527, soon, after, ascending, the, throne, he, published, a, constitution, for, his, hereditary, domains, hofstaatsordnung, and, established, austrian, style, institutions, in, pressburg, for, hungary, in, prague, for, bohemia, and, in, breslau, for, silesia, ferdinand, was, able, to, introduce, more, uniform, governments, for, his, realms, and, also, strengthen, his, control, over, finance, in, bohemia, which, provided, him, with, half, of, his, revenue, the, governments, basically, remained, independent, of, each, other, though, an, austrian, could, make, a, career, in, bohemian, administration, but, usually, only, after, naturalization, except, for, some, royal, prot, g, s, such, as, florian, griespeck, while, it, was, virtually, unheard, of, in, contrast, with, the, future, for, a, bohemian, to, gain, advancement, in, the, austrian, government, an, elected, king, himself, he, gradually, nudged, the, monarchy, towards, becoming, hereditary, which, would, finally, succeed, under, ferdinand, ii, holy, roman, emperor, in, 1547, the, bohemian, estates, rebelled, against, ferdinand, after, he, had, ordered, the, bohemian, army, to, move, against, the, german, protestants, after, suppressing, the, revolt, he, retaliated, by, limiting, the, privileges, of, bohemian, cities, and, inserting, a, new, bureaucracy, of, royal, officials, to, control, urban, authorities, ferdinand, was, a, supporter, of, the, counter, reformation, and, helped, lead, the, catholic, response, against, what, he, saw, as, the, heretical, tide, of, protestantism, for, example, in, 1551, he, invited, the, jesuits, to, vienna, and, in, 1556, to, prague, finally, in, 1561, ferdinand, revived, the, archdiocese, of, prague, which, had, been, previously, liquidated, due, to, the, success, of, the, protestants, after, the, ottoman, invasion, of, hungary, the, traditional, hungarian, coronation, city, sz, kesfeh, rv, r, came, under, ottoman, occupation, thus, in, 1536, the, hungarian, diet, decided, that, a, new, place, for, coronation, of, the, king, as, well, as, a, meeting, place, for, the, diet, itself, would, be, set, in, pressburg, ferdinand, proposed, that, the, hungarian, and, bohemian, diets, should, convene, and, hold, debates, together, with, the, austrian, estates, but, all, parties, refused, such, an, innovation, in, hungary, the, monarchy, remained, elective, until, 1627, with, habsburgs, female, inheritance, rights, being, acknowledged, in, 1723, although, the, kings, that, followed, ferdinand, would, always, be, habsburgs, a, rudimentary, union, between, austria, hungary, and, bohemia, was, formed, though, on, the, basis, of, common, legal, status, ferdinand, had, an, interest, in, keeping, bohemia, separate, from, imperial, jurisdiction, and, making, the, connection, between, bohemia, and, the, empire, looser, bohemia, did, not, have, to, pay, taxes, to, the, empire, as, he, gained, the, rights, of, an, imperial, prince, elector, as, king, of, bohemia, he, was, able, to, give, bohemia, as, well, as, associated, territories, such, as, upper, and, lower, lusatia, silesia, and, moravia, the, same, privileged, status, as, austria, therefore, affirming, his, superior, position, in, the, empire, in, december, 1562, ferdinand, had, archduke, maximilian, his, eldest, son, elected, king, of, the, romans, this, was, followed, with, succession, in, bohemia, and, in, 1563, the, crown, of, hungary, ferdinand, died, in, vienna, in, 1564, and, is, buried, in, st, vitus, cathedral, in, prague, after, his, death, maximilian, ascended, unchallenged, ferdinand, s, legacy, ultimately, proved, enduring, though, lacking, resources, he, managed, to, defend, his, land, against, the, ottomans, with, limited, support, from, his, brother, and, even, secured, a, part, of, hungary, that, would, later, provide, the, basis, for, the, conquest, of, the, whole, kingdom, by, the, habsburgs, in, his, own, possessions, he, built, a, tax, system, that, though, imperfect, would, continue, to, be, used, by, his, successors, his, handling, of, the, protestant, reformation, proved, more, flexible, and, more, effective, than, that, of, his, brother, and, he, played, a, key, part, in, the, settlement, of, 1555, which, started, an, era, of, peace, in, germany, his, statesmanship, overall, was, cautious, and, effective, on, the, other, hand, when, he, engaged, in, more, audacious, endeavours, like, his, offensives, against, buda, and, pest, it, often, ended, in, failure, fichtner, remarks, that, ferdinand, was, a, mediocre, military, commander, thus, the, many, difficulties, in, dealing, with, the, ottomans, in, hungary, but, an, energetic, and, very, imaginative, administrator, who, produced, a, framework, for, his, empire, that, endured, into, the, eighteenth, century, the, core, included, a, court, council, privy, council, central, treasury, and, a, body, for, military, affairs, with, the, written, business, conducted, by, a, common, chancery, in, his, time, and, in, practice, bohemia, and, hungary, resisted, cooperating, with, the, structure, but, the, german, territories, widely, imitated, it, ferdinand, was, also, a, patron, of, the, arts, he, embellished, vienna, and, prague, the, university, of, vienna, was, reorganized, he, also, called, jesuits, to, the, capital, city, attracted, architects, and, scholars, from, italy, and, the, low, countries, to, create, an, intellectual, milieu, surrounding, the, court, he, promoted, scholarly, interest, in, oriental, languages, the, humanists, he, invited, had, a, major, influence, on, his, son, maximilian, he, was, particularly, fond, of, music, and, hunting, while, not, a, gifted, commander, he, was, interested, in, military, matters, and, participated, in, several, campaigns, during, his, reign, he, was, the, last, king, of, germany, crowned, in, aachen, german, czech,
