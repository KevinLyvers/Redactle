carl, philipp, gottfried, or, gottlieb, von, clausewitz, german, pronunciation, 1, july, 1780, 16, november, 1831, was, a, prussian, general, and, military, theorist, who, stressed, the, moral, in, modern, terms, meaning, psychological, and, political, aspects, of, waging, war, his, most, notable, work, vom, kriege, on, war, though, unfinished, at, his, death, is, considered, a, seminal, treatise, on, military, strategy, and, science, clausewitz, stressed, the, multiplex, interaction, of, diverse, factors, in, war, noting, how, unexpected, developments, unfolding, under, the, fog, of, war, i, e, in, the, face, of, incomplete, dubious, and, often, erroneous, information, and, great, fear, doubt, and, excitement, call, for, rapid, decisions, by, alert, commanders, he, saw, history, as, a, vital, check, on, erudite, abstractions, that, did, not, accord, with, experience, in, contrast, to, the, early, work, of, antoine, henri, jomini, he, argued, that, war, could, not, be, quantified, or, reduced, to, mapwork, geometry, and, graphs, clausewitz, had, many, aphorisms, of, which, one, of, the, most, famous, is, war, is, the, continuation, of, policy, with, other, means, 87, clausewitz, s, christian, names, are, sometimes, given, in, non, german, sources, as, karl, carl, philipp, gottlieb, or, carl, maria, he, spelled, his, own, given, name, with, a, c, in, order, to, identify, with, the, classical, western, tradition, writers, who, use, karl, are, often, seeking, to, emphasize, their, german, rather, than, european, identity, carl, philipp, gottfried, appears, on, clausewitz, s, tombstone, nonetheless, sources, such, as, military, historian, peter, paret, and, encyclop, dia, britannica, continue, to, use, gottlieb, instead, of, gottfried, clausewitz, was, born, on, 1, july, 1780, in, burg, bei, magdeburg, in, the, prussian, duchy, of, magdeburg, as, the, fourth, and, youngest, son, of, a, family, that, made, claims, to, a, noble, status, which, carl, accepted, clausewitz, s, family, claimed, descent, from, the, barons, of, clausewitz, in, upper, silesia, though, scholars, question, the, connection, his, grandfather, the, son, of, a, lutheran, pastor, had, been, a, professor, of, theology, clausewitz, s, father, once, a, lieutenant, in, the, army, of, frederick, the, great, king, of, prussia, held, a, minor, post, in, the, prussian,

with, his, prince, in, france, from, 1807, to, 1808, returning, to, prussia, he, assisted, in, the, reform, of, the, prussian, army, and, state, johann, gottlieb, fichte, wrote, on, machiavelli, as, an, author, and, passages, from, his, writings, in, june, 1807, ber, machiavell, als, schriftsteller, und, stellen, aus, seinen, schriften, carl, clausewitz, wrote, an, interesting, and, anonymous, letter, to, fichte, 1809, about, his, book, on, machiavelli, the, letter, was, published, in, fichte, s, verstreute, kleine, schriften, 157, 166, for, an, english, translation, of, the, letter, see, carl, von, clausewitz, historical, and, political, writings, edited, by, peter, paret, and, d, moran, 1992, on, 10, december, 1810, he, married, the, socially, prominent, countess, marie, von, br, hl,

s, political, literary, and, intellectual, lite, marie, was, well, educated, and, politically, well, connected, she, played, an, important, role, in, her, husband, s, career, progress, and, intellectual, evolution, she, also, edited, published, and, introduced, his, collected, works, opposed, to, prussia, s, enforced, alliance, with, napoleon, clausewitz, left, the, prussian, army, and, served, in, the, imperial, russian, army, from, 1812, to, 1813, during, the, russian, campaign, taking, part, in, the, battle, of, borodino, 1812, like, many, prussian, officers, serving, in, russia, he, joined, the, russian, german, legion, in, 1813, in, the, service, of, the, russian, empire, clausewitz, helped, negotiate, the, convention, of, tauroggen, 1812, which, prepared, the, way, for, the, coalition, of, prussia, russia, and, the, united, kingdom, that, ultimately, defeated, napoleon, and, his, allies, in, 1815, the, russian, german, legion, became, integrated, into, the, prussian, army, and, clausewitz, re, entered, prussian, service, as, a, colonel, he, was, soon, appointed, chief, of, staff, of, johann, von, thielmann, s, iii, corps, in, that, capacity, he, served, at, the, battle, of, ligny, and, the, battle, of, wavre, during, the, waterloo, campaign, in, 1815, an, army, led, personally, by, napoleon, defeated, the, prussians, at, ligny, south, of, mont, saint, jean, and, the, village, of, waterloo, on, 16, june, 1815, but, they, withdrew, in, good, order, napoleon, s, failure, to, destroy, the, prussian, forces, led, to, his, defeat, a, few, days, later, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, 18, june, 1815, when, the, prussian, forces, arrived, on, his, right, flank, late, in, the, afternoon, to, support, the, anglo, dutch, belgian, forces, pressing, his, front, napoleon, had, convinced, his, troops, that, the, field, grey, uniforms, were, those, of, marshal, grouchy, s, grenadiers, clausewitz, s, unit, fought, heavily, outnumbered, at, wavre, 18, 19, june, 1815, preventing, large, reinforcements, from, reaching, napoleon, at, waterloo, after, the, war, clausewitz, served, as, the, director, of, the, kriegsakademie, where, he, served, until, 1830, in, that, year, he, returned, to, active, duty, with, the, army, soon, afterward, the, outbreak, of, several, revolutions, around, europe, and, a, crisis, in, poland, appeared, to, presage, another, major, european, war, clausewitz, was, appointed, chief, of, staff, of, the, only, army, prussia, was, able, to, mobilise, in, this, emergency, which, was, sent, to, the, polish, border, its, commander, gneisenau, died, of, cholera, august, 1831, and, clausewitz, took, command, of, the, prussian, army, s, efforts, to, construct, a, cordon, sanitaire, to, contain, the, great, cholera, outbreak, the, first, time, cholera, had, appeared, in, modern, heartland, europe, causing, a, continent, wide, panic, clausewitz, himself, died, of, the, same, disease, shortly, afterwards, on, 16, november, 1831, his, widow, edited, published, and, wrote, the, introduction, to, his, magnum, opus, on, the, philosophy, of, war, in, 1832, he, had, started, working, on, the, text, in, 1816, but, had, not, completed, it, she, wrote, the, preface, for, on, war, and, had, published, most, of, his, collected, works, by, 1835, she, died, in, january, 1836, clausewitz, was, a, professional, combat, soldier, and, a, staff, officer, who, was, involved, in, numerous, military, campaigns, but, he, is, famous, primarily, as, a, military, theorist, interested, in, the, examination, of, war, utilising, the, campaigns, of, frederick, the, great, and, napoleon, as, frames, of, reference, for, his, work, he, wrote, a, careful, systematic, philosophical, examination, of, war, in, all, its, aspects, the, result, was, his, principal, book, on, war, a, major, work, on, the, philosophy, of, war, it, was, unfinished, when, clausewitz, died, and, contains, material, written, at, different, stages, in, his, intellectual, evolution, producing, some, significant, contradictions, between, different, sections, the, sequence, and, precise, character, of, that, evolution, is, a, source, of, much, debate, as, to, the, exact, meaning, behind, some, seemingly, contradictory, observations, in, discussions, pertinent, to, the, tactical, operational, and, strategic, levels, of, war, for, example, though, many, of, these, apparent, contradictions, are, simply, the, result, of, his, dialectical, method, clausewitz, constantly, sought, to, revise, the, text, particularly, between, 1827, and, his, departure, on, his, last, field, assignments, to, include, more, material, on, people, s, war, and, forms, of, war, other, than, high, intensity, warfare, between, states, but, relatively, little, of, this, material, was, included, in, the, book, soldiers, before, this, time, had, written, treatises, on, various, military, subjects, but, none, had, undertaken, a, great, philosophical, examination, of, war, on, the, scale, of, those, written, by, clausewitz, and, leo, tolstoy, both, of, whom, were, inspired, by, the, events, of, the, napoleonic, era, clausewitz, s, work, is, still, studied, today, demonstrating, its, continued, relevance, more, than, sixteen, major, english, language, books, that, focused, specifically, on, his, work, were, published, between, 2005, and, 2014, whereas, his, 19th, century, rival, jomini, has, faded, from, influence, the, historian, lynn, montross, said, that, this, outcome, may, be, explained, by, the, fact, that, jomini, produced, a, system, of, war, clausewitz, a, philosophy, the, one, has, been, outdated, by, new, weapons, the, other, still, influences, the, strategy, behind, those, weapons, jomini, did, not, attempt, to, define, war, but, clausewitz, did, providing, and, dialectically, comparing, a, number, of, definitions, the, first, is, his, dialectical, thesis, war, is, thus, an, act, of, force, to, compel, our, enemy, to, do, our, will, the, second, often, treated, as, clausewitz, s, bottom, line, is, in, fact, merely, his, dialectical, antithesis, war, is, merely, the, continuation, of, policy, with, other, means, the, synthesis, of, his, dialectical, examination, of, the, nature, of, war, is, his, famous, trinity, saying, that, war, is, a, fascinating, trinity, composed, of, primordial, violence, hatred, and, enmity, which, are, to, be, regarded, as, a, blind, natural, force, the, play, of, chance, and, probability, within, which, the, creative, spirit, is, free, to, roam, and, its, element, of, subordination, as, an, instrument, of, policy, which, makes, it, subject, to, pure, reason, christopher, bassford, says, the, best, shorthand, for, clausewitz, s, trinity, should, be, something, like, violent, emotion, chance, rational, calculation, however, it, is, frequently, presented, as, people, army, government, a, misunderstanding, based, on, a, later, paragraph, in, the, same, section, this, misrepresentation, was, popularised, by, u, s, army, colonel, harry, summers, vietnam, era, interpretation, facilitated, by, weaknesses, in, the, 1976, howard, paret, translation, the, degree, to, which, clausewitz, managed, to, revise, his, manuscript, to, reflect, that, synthesis, is, the, subject, of, much, debate, his, final, reference, to, war, and, politik, however, goes, beyond, his, widely, quoted, antithesis, war, is, simply, the, continuation, of, political, intercourse, with, the, addition, of, other, means, we, deliberately, use, the, phrase, with, the, addition, of, other, means, because, we, also, want, to, make, it, clear, that, war, in, itself, does, not, suspend, political, intercourse, or, change, it, into, something, entirely, different, in, essentials, that, intercourse, continues, irrespective, of, the, means, it, employs, the, main, lines, along, which, military, events, progress, and, to, which, they, are, restricted, are, political, lines, that, continue, throughout, the, war, into, the, subsequent, peace, a, prince, or, general, who, knows, exactly, how, to, organise, his, war, according, to, his, object, and, means, who, does, neither, too, little, nor, too, much, gives, by, that, the, greatest, proof, of, his, genius, but, the, effects, of, this, talent, are, exhibited, not, so, much, by, the, invention, of, new, modes, of, action, which, might, strike, the, eye, immediately, as, in, the, successful, final, result, of, the, whole, it, is, the, exact, fulfilment, of, silent, suppositions, it, is, the, noiseless, harmony, of, the, whole, action, which, we, should, admire, and, which, only, makes, itself, known, in, the, total, result, clausewitz, introduced, systematic, philosophical, contemplation, into, western, military, thinking, with, powerful, implications, not, only, for, historical, and, analytical, writing, but, also, for, practical, policy, military, instruction, and, operational, planning, he, relied, on, his, own, experiences, contemporary, writings, about, napoleon, and, on, deep, historical, research, his, historiographical, approach, is, evident, in, his, first, extended, study, written, when, he, was, 25, of, the, thirty, years, war, he, rejects, the, enlightenment, s, view, of, the, war, as, a, chaotic, muddle, and, instead, explains, its, drawn, out, operations, by, the, economy, and, technology, of, the, age, the, social, characteristics, of, the, troops, and, the, commanders, politics, and, psychology, in, on, war, clausewitz, sees, all, wars, as, the, sum, of, decisions, actions, and, reactions, in, an, uncertain, and, dangerous, context, and, also, as, a, socio, political, phenomenon, he, also, stressed, the, complex, nature, of, war, which, encompasses, both, the, socio, political, and, the, operational, and, stresses, the, primacy, of, state, policy, one, should, be, careful, not, to, limit, his, observations, on, war, to, war, between, states, however, as, he, certainly, discusses, other, kinds, of, protagonists, viii, the, word, strategy, had, only, recently, come, into, usage, in, modern, europe, and, clausewitz, s, definition, is, quite, narrow, the, use, of, engagements, for, the, object, of, war, which, many, today, would, call, the, operational, level, of, war, clausewitz, conceived, of, war, as, a, political, social, and, military, phenomenon, which, might, depending, on, circumstances, involve, the, entire, population, of, a, political, entity, at, war, in, any, case, clausewitz, saw, military, force, as, an, instrument, that, states, and, other, political, actors, use, to, pursue, the, ends, of, their, policy, in, a, dialectic, between, opposing, wills, each, with, the, aim, of, imposing, his, policies, and, will, upon, his, enemy, clausewitz, s, emphasis, on, the, inherent, superiority, of, the, defense, suggests, that, habitual, aggressors, are, likely, to, end, up, as, failures, the, inherent, superiority, of, the, defense, obviously, does, not, mean, that, the, defender, will, always, win, however, there, are, other, asymmetries, to, be, considered, he, was, interested, in, co, operation, between, the, regular, army, and, militia, or, partisan, forces, or, citizen, soldiers, as, one, possible, sometimes, the, only, method, of, defense, in, the, circumstances, of, the, wars, of, the, french, revolution, and, those, with, napoleon, which, were, energised, by, a, rising, spirit, of, nationalism, he, emphasised, the, need, for, states, to, involve, their, entire, populations, in, the, conduct, of, war, this, point, is, especially, important, as, these, wars, demonstrated, that, such, energies, could, be, of, decisive, importance, and, for, a, time, led, to, a, democratisation, of, the, armed, forces, much, as, universal, suffrage, democratised, politics, while, clausewitz, was, intensely, aware, of, the, value, of, intelligence, at, all, levels, he, was, also, very, skeptical, of, the, accuracy, of, much, military, intelligence, many, intelligence, reports, in, war, are, contradictory, even, more, are, false, and, most, are, uncertain, in, short, most, intelligence, is, false, vol, i, p, 38, this, circumstance, is, generally, described, as, part, of, the, fog, of, war, such, skeptical, comments, apply, only, to, intelligence, at, the, tactical, and, operational, levels, at, the, strategic, and, political, levels, he, constantly, stressed, the, requirement, for, the, best, possible, understanding, of, what, today, would, be, called, strategic, and, political, intelligence, his, conclusions, were, influenced, by, his, experiences, in, the, prussian, army, which, was, often, in, an, intelligence, fog, due, partly, to, the, superior, abilities, of, napoleon, s, system, but, even, more, simply, to, the, nature, of, war, clausewitz, acknowledges, that, friction, creates, enormous, difficulties, for, the, realization, of, any, plan, and, the, fog, of, war, hinders, commanders, from, knowing, what, is, happening, it, is, precisely, in, the, context, of, this, challenge, that, he, develops, the, concept, of, military, genius, german, der, kriegerische, genius, evidenced, above, all, in, the, execution, of, operations, military, genius, is, not, simply, a, matter, of, intellect, but, a, combination, of, qualities, of, intellect, experience, personality, and, temperament, and, there, are, many, possible, such, combinations, that, create, a, very, highly, developed, mental, aptitude, for, the, waging, of, war, key, ideas, discussed, in, on, war, include, clausewitz, used, a, dialectical, method, to, construct, his, argument, leading, to, frequent, misinterpretation, of, his, ideas, british, military, theorist, b, h, liddell, hart, contends, that, the, enthusiastic, acceptance, by, the, prussian, military, establishment, especially, moltke, the, elder, a, former, student, of, clausewitz, of, what, they, believed, to, be, clausewitz, s, ideas, and, the, subsequent, widespread, adoption, of, the, prussian, military, system, worldwide, had, a, deleterious, effect, on, military, theory, and, practice, due, to, their, egregious, misinterpretation, of, his, ideas, as, so, often, happens, clausewitz, s, disciples, carried, his, teaching, to, an, extreme, which, their, master, had, not, intended, theory, of, war, was, expounded, in, a, way, too, abstract, and, involved, for, ordinary, soldier, minds, essentially, concrete, to, follow, the, course, of, his, argument, which, often, turned, back, from, the, direction, in, which, it, was, apparently, leading, impressed, yet, befogged, they, grasped, at, his, vivid, leading, phrases, seeing, only, their, surface, meaning, and, missing, the, deeper, current, of, his, thought, as, described, by, christopher, bassford, then, professor, of, strategy, at, the, national, war, college, of, the, united, states, one, of, the, main, sources, of, confusion, about, clausewitz, s, approach, lies, in, his, dialectical, method, of, presentation, for, example, clausewitz, s, famous, line, that, war, is, the, continuation, of, policy, with, other, means, der, krieg, ist, eine, blo, e, fortsetzung, der, politik, mit, anderen, mitteln, while, accurate, as, far, as, it, goes, was, not, intended, as, a, statement, of, fact, it, is, the, antithesis, in, a, dialectical, argument, whose, thesis, is, the, point, made, earlier, in, the, analysis, that, war, is, nothing, but, a, duel, on, a, larger, scale, his, synthesis, which, resolves, the, deficiencies, of, these, two, bold, statements, says, that, war, is, neither, nothing, but, an, act, of, brute, force, nor, merely, a, rational, act, of, politics, or, policy, this, synthesis, lies, in, his, fascinating, trinity, a, dynamic, inherently, unstable, interaction, of, the, forces, of, violent, emotion, chance, and, rational, calculation, another, example, of, this, confusion, is, the, idea, that, clausewitz, was, a, proponent, of, total, war, as, used, in, the, third, reich, s, propaganda, in, the, 1940s, in, fact, clausewitz, never, used, the, term, total, war, rather, he, discussed, absolute, war, a, concept, which, evolved, into, the, much, more, abstract, notion, of, ideal, war, discussed, at, the, very, beginning, of, vom, kriege, the, purely, logical, result, of, the, forces, underlying, a, pure, platonic, ideal, of, war, in, what, he, called, a, logical, fantasy, war, cannot, be, waged, in, a, limited, way, the, rules, of, competition, will, force, participants, to, use, all, means, at, their, disposal, to, achieve, victory, but, in, the, real, world, he, said, such, rigid, logic, is, unrealistic, and, dangerous, as, a, practical, matter, the, military, objectives, in, real, war, that, support, political, objectives, generally, fall, into, two, broad, types, limited, aims, or, the, effective, disarming, of, the, enemy, to, render, politically, helpless, or, militarily, impotent, thus, the, complete, defeat, of, the, enemy, may, not, be, necessary, desirable, or, even, possible, in, modern, times, the, reconstruction, of, clausewitzian, theory, has, been, a, matter, of, much, dispute, one, analysis, was, that, of, panagiotis, kondylis, a, greek, writer, and, philosopher, who, opposed, the, interpretations, of, raymond, aron, in, penser, la, guerre, clausewitz, and, other, liberal, writers, according, to, aron, clausewitz, was, one, of, the, first, writers, to, condemn, the, militarism, of, the, prussian, general, staff, and, its, war, proneness, based, on, clausewitz, s, argument, that, war, is, a, continuation, of, policy, by, other, means, in, theory, of, war, kondylis, claims, that, this, is, inconsistent, with, clausewitzian, thought, he, claims, that, clausewitz, was, morally, indifferent, to, war, though, this, probably, reflects, a, lack, of, familiarity, with, personal, letters, from, clausewitz, which, demonstrate, an, acute, awareness, of, war, s, tragic, aspects, and, that, his, advice, regarding, politics, dominance, over, the, conduct, of, war, has, nothing, to, do, with, pacifist, ideas, other, notable, writers, who, have, studied, clausewitz, s, texts, and, translated, them, into, english, are, historians, peter, paret, of, the, institute, for, advanced, study, and, sir, michael, howard, howard, and, paret, edited, the, most, widely, used, edition, of, on, war, princeton, university, press, 1976, 1984, and, have, produced, comparative, studies, of, clausewitz, and, other, theorists, such, as, tolstoy, bernard, brodie, s, a, guide, to, the, reading, of, on, war, in, the, 1976, princeton, translation, expressed, his, interpretations, of, the, prussian, s, theories, and, provided, students, with, an, influential, synopsis, of, this, vital, work, the, 1873, translation, by, colonel, james, john, graham, was, heavily, and, controversially, edited, by, the, philosopher, musician, and, game, theorist, anatol, rapoport, the, british, military, historian, john, keegan, attacked, clausewitz, s, theory, in, his, book, a, history, of, warfare, keegan, argued, that, clausewitz, assumed, the, existence, of, states, yet, war, antedates, the, state, diplomacy, and, strategy, by, many, millennia, clausewitz, died, without, completing, vom, kriege, but, despite, this, his, ideas, have, been, widely, influential, in, military, theory, and, have, had, a, strong, influence, on, german, military, thought, specifically, later, prussian, and, german, generals, such, as, helmuth, graf, von, moltke, were, clearly, influenced, by, clausewitz, moltke, s, widely, quoted, statement, that, no, operational, plan, extends, with, high, certainty, beyond, the, first, encounter, with, the, main, enemy, force, is, a, classic, reflection, of, clausewitz, s, insistence, on, the, roles, of, chance, friction, fog, uncertainty, and, interactivity, in, war, 20, 21, clausewitz, s, influence, spread, to, british, thinking, as, well, though, at, first, more, as, a, historian, and, analyst, than, as, a, theorist, see, for, example, wellington, s, extended, essay, discussing, clausewitz, s, study, of, the, campaign, of, 1815, wellington, s, only, serious, written, discussion, of, the, battle, which, was, widely, discussed, in, 19th, century, britain, clausewitz, s, broader, thinking, came, to, the, fore, following, britain, s, military, embarrassments, in, the, boer, war, 1899, 1902, one, example, of, a, heavy, clausewitzian, influence, in, that, era, is, spenser, wilkinson, journalist, the, first, chichele, professor, of, military, history, at, oxford, university, and, perhaps, the, most, prominent, military, analyst, in, britain, from, c, 1885, until, well, into, the, interwar, period, another, is, naval, historian, julian, corbett, 1854, 1922, whose, work, reflected, a, deep, if, idiosyncratic, adherence, to, clausewitz, s, concepts, and, frequently, an, emphasis, on, clausewitz, s, ideas, about, limited, objectives, and, the, inherent, strengths, of, the, defensive, form, of, war, corbett, s, practical, strategic, views, were, often, in, prominent, public, conflict, with, wilkinson, s, see, for, example, wilkinson, s, article, strategy, at, sea, the, morning, post, 12, february, 1912, following, the, first, world, war, however, the, influential, british, military, commentator, b, h, liddell, hart, in, the, 1920s, erroneously, attributed, to, him, the, doctrine, of, total, war, that, during, the, first, world, war, had, been, embraced, by, many, european, general, staffs, and, emulated, by, the, british, more, recent, scholars, typically, see, that, war, as, so, confused, in, terms, of, political, rationale, that, it, in, fact, contradicts, much, of, on, war, that, view, assumes, however, a, set, of, values, as, to, what, constitutes, rational, political, objectives, in, this, case, values, not, shaped, by, the, fervid, social, darwinism, that, was, rife, in, 1914, europe, one, of, the, most, influential, british, clausewitzians, today, is, colin, s, gray, historian, hew, strachan, like, wilkinson, also, the, chichele, professor, of, military, history, at, oxford, university, since, 2001, has, been, an, energetic, proponent, of, the, study, of, clausewitz, but, his, own, views, on, clausewitz, s, ideas, are, somewhat, ambivalent, with, some, interesting, exceptions, e, g, john, mcauley, palmer, robert, m, johnston, hoffman, nickerson, clausewitz, had, little, influence, on, american, military, thought, before, 1945, other, than, via, british, writers, though, generals, eisenhower, and, patton, were, avid, readers, of, english, translations, he, did, influence, karl, marx, friedrich, engels, vladimir, lenin, leon, trotsky, 233, 260, v, nguy, n, gi, p, ferdinand, foch, and, mao, zedong, and, thus, the, communist, soviet, and, chinese, traditions, as, lenin, emphasized, the, inevitability, of, wars, among, capitalist, states, in, the, age, of, imperialism, and, presented, the, armed, struggle, of, the, working, class, as, the, only, path, toward, the, eventual, elimination, of, war, because, lenin, was, an, admirer, of, clausewitz, and, called, him, one, of, the, great, military, writers, his, influence, on, the, red, army, was, immense, the, russian, historian, a, n, mertsalov, commented, that, it, was, an, irony, of, fate, that, the, view, in, the, ussr, was, that, it, was, lenin, who, shaped, the, attitude, towards, clausewitz, and, that, lenin, s, dictum, that, war, is, a, continuation, of, politics, is, taken, from, the, work, of, this, anti, humanist, anti, revolutionary, the, american, mathematician, anatol, rapoport, wrote, in, 1968, that, clausewitz, as, interpreted, by, lenin, formed, the, basis, of, all, soviet, military, thinking, since, 1917, and, quoted, the, remarks, by, marshal, v, d, sokolovsky, in, describing, the, essence, of, war, marxism, leninism, takes, as, its, point, of, departure, the, premise, that, war, is, not, an, aim, in, itself, but, rather, a, tool, of, politics, in, his, remarks, on, clausewitz, s, on, war, lenin, stressed, that, politics, is, the, reason, and, war, is, only, the, tool, not, the, other, way, around, consequently, it, remains, only, to, subordinate, the, military, point, of, view, to, the, political, 37, henry, a, kissinger, however, described, lenin, s, approach, as, being, that, politics, is, a, continuation, of, war, by, other, means, thus, turning, clausewitz, s, argument, on, its, head, 198, rapoport, argued, that, as, for, lenin, s, approval, of, clausewitz, it, probably, stems, from, his, obsession, with, the, struggle, for, power, the, whole, marxist, conception, of, history, is, that, of, successive, struggles, for, power, primarily, between, social, classes, this, was, constantly, applied, by, lenin, in, a, variety, of, contexts, thus, the, entire, history, of, philosophy, appears, in, lenin, s, writings, as, a, vast, struggle, between, idealism, and, materialism, the, fate, of, the, socialist, movement, was, to, be, decided, by, a, struggle, between, the, revolutionists, and, the, reformers, clausewitz, s, acceptance, of, the, struggle, for, power, as, the, essence, of, international, politics, must, have, impressed, lenin, as, starkly, realistic, 37, 38, clausewitz, directly, influenced, mao, zedong, who, read, on, war, in, 1938, and, organised, a, seminar, on, clausewitz, for, the, party, leadership, in, yan, an, thus, the, clausewitzian, content, in, many, of, mao, s, writings, is, not, merely, a, regurgitation, of, lenin, but, reflects, mao, s, own, study, the, idea, that, war, involves, inherent, friction, that, distorts, to, a, greater, or, lesser, degree, all, prior, arrangements, has, become, common, currency, in, fields, such, as, business, strategy, and, sport, the, phrase, fog, of, war, derives, from, clausewitz, s, stress, on, how, confused, warfare, can, seem, while, one, is, immersed, within, it, the, term, center, of, gravity, used, in, a, military, context, derives, from, clausewitz, s, usage, which, he, took, from, newtonian, mechanics, in, u, s, military, doctrine, center, of, gravity, refers, to, the, basis, of, an, opponent, s, power, at, the, operational, strategic, or, political, level, though, this, is, only, one, aspect, of, clausewitz, s, use, of, the, term, the, deterrence, strategy, of, the, united, states, in, the, 1950s, was, closely, inspired, by, president, dwight, eisenhower, s, reading, of, clausewitz, as, a, young, officer, in, the, 1920s, eisenhower, was, greatly, impressed, by, clausewitz, s, example, of, a, theoretical, idealized, absolute, war, in, vom, kriege, as, a, way, of, demonstrating, how, absurd, it, would, be, to, attempt, such, a, strategy, in, practice, for, eisenhower, the, age, of, nuclear, weapons, had, made, what, was, for, clausewitz, in, the, early, 19th, century, only, a, theoretical, vision, an, all, too, real, possibility, in, the, mid, 20th, century, from, eisenhower, s, viewpoint, the, best, deterrent, to, war, was, to, show, the, world, just, how, appalling, and, horrific, a, nuclear, absolute, war, would, be, if, it, should, ever, occur, hence, a, series, of, much, publicized, nuclear, tests, in, the, pacific, giving, first, priority, in, the, defense, budget, to, nuclear, weapons, and, to, their, delivery, systems, over, conventional, weapons, and, making, repeated, statements, in, public, that, the, united, states, was, able, and, willing, at, all, times, to, use, nuclear, weapons, in, this, way, through, the, massive, retaliation, doctrine, and, the, closely, related, foreign, policy, concept, of, brinkmanship, eisenhower, hoped, to, hold, out, a, credible, vision, of, clausewitzian, nuclear, absolute, war, in, order, to, deter, the, soviet, union, and, or, china, from, ever, risking, a, war, or, even, conditions, that, might, lead, to, a, war, with, the, united, states, philanthropists, may, easily, imagine, there, is, a, skillful, method, of, disarming, and, overcoming, an, enemy, without, causing, great, bloodshed, and, that, this, is, the, proper, tendency, of, the, art, of, war, however, plausible, this, may, appear, still, it, is, an, error, which, must, be, extirpated, for, in, such, dangerous, things, as, war, the, errors, which, proceed, from, a, spirit, of, benevolence, are, just, the, worst, as, the, use, of, physical, power, to, the, utmost, extent, by, no, means, excludes, the, co, operation, of, the, intelligence, it, follows, that, he, who, uses, force, unsparingly, without, reference, to, the, quantity, of, bloodshed, must, obtain, a, superiority, if, his, adversary, does, not, act, likewise, by, such, means, the, former, dictates, the, law, to, the, latter, and, both, proceed, to, extremities, to, which, the, only, limitations, are, those, imposed, by, the, amount, of, counteracting, force, on, each, side, after, 1970, some, theorists, claimed, that, nuclear, proliferation, made, clausewitzian, concepts, obsolete, after, the, 20th, century, period, in, which, they, dominated, the, world, john, e, sheppard, jr, argues, that, by, developing, nuclear, weapons, state, based, conventional, armies, simultaneously, both, perfected, their, original, purpose, to, destroy, a, mirror, image, of, themselves, and, made, themselves, obsolete, no, two, powers, have, used, nuclear, weapons, against, each, other, instead, using, diplomacy, conventional, means, or, proxy, wars, to, settle, disputes, if, such, a, conflict, did, occur, presumably, both, combatants, would, be, annihilated, heavily, influenced, by, the, war, in, vietnam, and, by, antipathy, to, american, strategist, henry, kissinger, the, american, biologist, musician, and, game, theorist, anatol, rapoport, argued, in, 1968, that, a, clausewitzian, view, of, war, was, not, only, obsolete, in, the, age, of, nuclear, weapons, but, also, highly, dangerous, as, it, promoted, a, zero, sum, paradigm, to, international, relations, and, a, dissolution, of, rationality, amongst, decision, makers, 73, 77, the, end, of, the, 20th, century, and, the, beginning, of, the, 21st, century, have, seen, many, instances, of, state, armies, attempting, to, suppress, insurgencies, and, terrorism, and, engaging, in, other, forms, of, asymmetrical, warfare, clausewitz, did, not, focus, solely, on, wars, between, countries, with, well, defined, armies, the, era, of, the, french, revolution, and, napoleon, was, full, of, revolutions, rebellions, and, violence, by, non, state, actors, witness, the, wars, in, the, french, vend, e, and, in, spain, clausewitz, wrote, a, series, of, lectures, on, small, war, and, studied, the, rebellion, in, the, vend, e, 1793, 1796, and, the, tyrolean, uprising, of, 1809, in, his, famous, bekenntnisdenkschrift, of, 1812, he, called, for, a, spanish, war, in, germany, and, laid, out, a, comprehensive, guerrilla, strategy, to, be, waged, against, napoleon, in, on, war, he, included, a, famous, chapter, on, the, people, in, arms, one, prominent, critic, of, clausewitz, is, the, israeli, military, historian, martin, van, creveld, in, his, 1991, book, the, transformation, of, war, creveld, argued, that, clausewitz, s, famous, trinity, of, people, army, and, government, was, an, obsolete, socio, political, construct, based, on, the, state, which, was, rapidly, passing, from, the, scene, as, the, key, player, in, war, and, that, he, creveld, had, constructed, a, new, non, trinitarian, model, for, modern, warfare, creveld, s, work, has, had, great, influence, daniel, moran, replied, the, most, egregious, misrepresentation, of, clausewitz, s, famous, metaphor, must, be, that, of, martin, van, creveld, who, has, declared, clausewitz, to, be, an, apostle, of, trinitarian, war, by, which, he, means, incomprehensibly, a, war, of, state, against, state, and, army, against, army, from, which, the, influence, of, the, people, is, entirely, excluded, christopher, bassford, went, further, noting, that, one, need, only, read, the, paragraph, in, which, clausewitz, defined, his, trinity, to, see, that, the, words, people, army, and, government, appear, nowhere, at, all, in, the, list, of, the, trinity, s, components, creveld, s, and, keegan, s, assault, on, clausewitz, s, trinity, is, not, only, a, classic, blow, into, the, air, i, e, an, assault, on, a, position, clausewitz, doesn, t, occupy, it, is, also, a, pointless, attack, on, a, concept, that, is, quite, useful, in, its, own, right, in, any, case, their, failure, to, read, the, actual, wording, of, the, theory, they, so, vociferously, attack, and, to, grasp, its, deep, relevance, to, the, phenomena, they, describe, is, hard, to, credit, some, have, gone, further, and, suggested, that, clausewitz, s, best, known, aphorism, that, war, is, a, continuation, of, policy, with, other, means, is, not, only, irrelevant, today, but, also, inapplicable, historically, for, an, opposing, view, see, the, sixteen, essays, presented, in, clausewitz, in, the, twenty, first, century, edited, by, hew, strachan, and, andreas, herberg, rothe, in, military, academies, schools, and, universities, worldwide, clausewitz, s, vom, kriege, is, often, usually, in, translation, mandatory, reading, some, theorists, of, management, look, to, clausewitz, just, as, some, look, to, sun, tzu, to, bolster, ideas, on, the, concept, of, leadership, informational, notes, citations
