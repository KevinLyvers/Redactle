thomas, robert, malthus, frs, m, l, s, 13, 14, february, 1766, 29, december, 1834, was, an, english, economist, cleric, and, scholar, influential, in, the, fields, of, political, economy, and, demography, in, his, 1798, book, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, malthus, observed, that, an, increase, in, a, nation, s, food, production, improved, the, well, being, of, the, population, but, the, improvement, was, temporary, because, it, led, to, population, growth, which, in, turn, restored, the, original, per, capita, production, level, in, other, words, humans, had, a, propensity, to, use, abundance, for, population, growth, rather, than, for, maintaining, a, high, standard, of, living, a, view, and, stance, that, has, become, known, as, the, malthusian, trap, or, the, malthusian, spectre, populations, had, a, tendency, to, grow, until, the, lower, class, suffered, hardship, want, and, greater, susceptibility, to, war, famine, and, disease, a, pessimistic, view, that, is, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, malthusian, catastrophe, malthus, wrote, in, opposition, to, the, popular, view, in, 18th, century, europe, that, saw, society, as, improving, and, in, principle, as, perfectible, malthus, considered, population, growth, as, inevitable, whenever, conditions, improved, thereby, precluding, real, progress, towards, a, utopian, society, the, power, of, population, is, indefinitely, greater, than, the, power, in, the, earth, to, produce, subsistence, for, man, as, an, anglican, cleric, he, saw, this, situation, as, divinely, imposed, to, teach, virtuous, behavior, malthus, wrote, that, the, increase, of, population, is, necessarily, limited, by, subsistence, population, does, invariably, increase, when, the, means, of, subsistence, increase, and, the, superior, power, of, population, repress, by, moral, restraint, vice, and, misery, malthus, criticised, the, poor, laws, for, leading, to, inflation, rather, than, improving, the, well, being, of, the, poor, he, supported, taxes, on, grain, imports, the, corn, laws, his, views, became, influential, and, controversial, across, economic, political, social, and, scientific, thought, pioneers, of, evolutionary, biology, read, him, notably, charles, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, malthus, s, failure, to, predict, the, industrial, revolution, was, a, frequent, criticism, of, his, theories, malthus, laid, the, theoretical, foundation, of, the, conventional, wisdom, that, has, dominated, the, debate, both, scientifically, and, ideologically, on, global, hunger, and, famines, for, almost, two, centuries, he, remains, a, much, debated, writer, thomas, robert, malthus, was, the, sixth, of, seven, children, of, daniel, malthus, and, henrietta, catherine, daughter, of, daniel, graham, apothecary, to, kings, george, ii, and, george, iii, and, granddaughter, of, thomas, graham, apothecary, to, kings, george, i, and, george, ii, henrietta, was, depicted, alongside, her, siblings, in, william, hogarth, s, painting, the, graham, children, 1742, malthus, was, born, at, the, rookery, a, small, elegant, mansion, at, westcott, near, dorking, in, surrey, which, his, father, had, bought, at, that, time, called, chertgate, farm, and, converted, into, a, gentleman, s, seat, the, family, sold, it, in, 1768, and, moved, to, a, less, extensive, establishment, at, albury, not, far, from, guildford, malthus, had, a, cleft, lip, and, palate, which, affected, his, speech, such, birth, defects, had, occurred, in, previous, generations, of, his, family, his, friend, the, social, theorist, harriet, martineau, who, was, hard, of, hearing, nevertheless, stated, that, due, to, his, sonorous, voice, he, was, the, only, person, she, could, hear, well, without, her, ear, trumpet, william, petersen, and, john, maynard, keynes, describe, daniel, malthus, as, a, gentleman, of, good, family, and, independent, means, a, friend, of, david, hume, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, daniel, malthus, was, son, of, sydenham, malthus, who, was, a, clerk, of, chancery, and, director, of, the, south, sea, company, he, was, also, proprietor, of, several, landed, properties, in, the, home, counties, and, cambridgeshire, sydenham, malthus, s, father, daniel, had, been, apothecary, to, king, william, and, later, to, queen, anne, daniel, s, father, rev, robert, malthus, was, appointed, vicar, of, northolt, middlesex, now, west, london, under, the, regicide, cromwell, but, evicted, at, the, restoration, he, was, described, as, an, ancient, divine, a, man, of, strong, reason, and, mighty, in, the, scriptures, of, great, eloquence, and, fervour, though, defective, in, elocution, due, to, a, very, great, impediment, in, his, utterance, which, has, been, concluded, to, be, likely, to, have, been, a, cleft, palate, the, young, malthus, received, his, education, at, the, warrington, academy, from, 1782, where, he, was, taught, by, gilbert, wakefield, warrington, was, a, dissenting, academy, which, closed, in, 1783, malthus, continued, for, a, period, to, be, tutored, by, wakefield, at, the, latter, s, home, in, bramcote, nottinghamshire, malthus, entered, jesus, college, cambridge, in, 1784, while, there, he, took, prizes, in, english, declamation, latin, and, greek, and, graduated, with, honours, ninth, wrangler, in, mathematics, his, tutor, was, william, frend, he, took, the, ma, degree, in, 1791, and, was, elected, a, fellow, of, jesus, college, two, years, later, in, 1789, he, took, orders, in, the, church, of, england, and, became, a, curate, at, oakwood, chapel, also, okewood, in, the, parish, of, wotton, surrey, malthus, came, to, prominence, for, his, 1798, publication, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, he, wrote, the, original, text, in, reaction, to, the, optimism, of, his, father, and, his, father, s, associates, notably, jean, jacques, rousseau, regarding, the, future, improvement, of, society, he, also, constructed, his, case, as, a, specific, response, to, writings, of, william, godwin, 1756, 1836, and, of, the, marquis, de, condorcet, 1743, 1794, his, assertions, evoked, questions, and, criticism, and, between, 1798, and, 1826, he, published, six, more, versions, of, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, updating, each, edition, to, incorporate, new, material, to, address, criticism, and, to, convey, changes, in, his, own, perspectives, on, the, subject, the, malthusian, controversy, to, which, the, essay, gave, rise, in, the, decades, following, its, publication, tended, to, focus, attention, on, the, birth, rate, and, marriage, rates, the, neo, malthusian, controversy, comprising, related, debates, of, many, years, later, has, seen, a, similar, central, role, assigned, to, the, numbers, of, children, born, the, goal, of, malthusian, theory, is, to, explain, how, population, and, food, production, expand, with, the, latter, experiencing, arithmetic, growth, and, the, former, experiencing, exponential, growth, the, controversy, however, concerns, the, relevance, of, malthusian, theory, in, the, present, world, this, hypothesis, is, inapplicable, in, a, number, of, ways, first, the, hypothesis, is, rendered, irrelevant, due, to, a, disregard, for, technological, advancement, this, is, because, food, production, has, increased, as, a, result, of, technological, advancements, such, as, genetically, modified, organisms, gmos, second, the, mathematical, model, employed, to, formulate, the, hypothesis, is, incorrect, since, it, was, constrained, to, england, s, specific, situation, other, findings, such, as, food, production, exceeding, population, increase, may, be, borne, out, if, the, modeling, could, employ, wide, locations, like, australia, the, malthusian, hypothesis, is, also, limited, by, social, change, about, family, size, as, individuals, tend, to, prefer, a, manageable, family, owing, to, economic, restrictions, food, production, can, also, outpace, population, expansion, due, to, the, industrial, revolution, another, limitation, of, this, theory, is, the, belief, that, overall, income, is, a, key, factor, of, population, health, implying, that, wealthy, countries, will, have, various, solutions, for, their, rapidly, rising, populations, an, expanding, population, can, be, considered, as, an, increase, of, available, human, capacity, for, increasing, food, production, the, static, aspect, of, the, malthusian, hypothesis, which, is, based, on, the, rule, of, decreasing, returns, limits, its, applicability, finally, malthusian, theory, s, failure, to, determine, whether, birth, rates, match, death, rates, hampered, its, application, because, it, was, possible, that, the, population, was, not, rising, as, fast, as, food, production, due, to, the, presence, of, deaths, in, 1799, malthus, made, a, european, tour, with, william, otter, a, close, college, friend, travelling, part, of, the, way, with, edward, daniel, clarke, and, john, marten, cripps, visiting, germany, scandinavia, and, russia, malthus, used, the, tour, to, gather, population, data, otter, later, wrote, a, memoir, of, malthus, for, the, second, 1836, edition, of, his, principles, of, political, economy, during, the, peace, of, amiens, of, 1802, he, travelled, to, france, and, switzerland, in, a, party, that, included, his, relation, and, future, wife, harriet, in, 1803, he, became, rector, of, walesby, lincolnshire, in, 1805, malthus, became, professor, of, history, and, political, economy, at, the, east, india, company, college, in, hertfordshire, his, students, affectionately, referred, to, him, as, pop, population, or, web, toe, malthus, near, the, end, of, 1817, the, proposed, appointment, of, graves, champney, haughton, to, the, college, was, made, a, pretext, by, randle, jackson, and, joseph, hume, to, launch, an, attempt, to, close, it, down, malthus, wrote, a, pamphlet, defending, the, college, which, was, reprieved, by, the, east, india, company, within, the, same, year, 1817, in, 1818, malthus, became, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, during, the, 1820s, a, setpiece, intellectual, discussion, took, place, among, the, exponents, of, political, economy, often, called, the, malthus, ricardo, debate, after, its, leading, figures, malthus, and, theorist, of, free, trade, david, ricardo, both, of, whom, had, written, books, with, the, title, principles, of, political, economy, under, examination, were, the, nature, and, methods, of, political, economy, itself, while, it, was, simultaneously, under, attack, from, others, the, roots, of, the, debate, were, in, the, previous, decade, in, the, nature, of, rent, 1815, malthus, had, dealt, with, economic, rent, a, major, concept, in, classical, economics, ricardo, defined, a, theory, of, rent, in, his, principles, of, political, economy, and, taxation, 1817, he, regarded, rent, as, value, in, excess, of, real, production, something, caused, by, ownership, rather, than, by, free, trade, rent, therefore, represented, a, kind, of, negative, money, that, landlords, could, pull, out, of, the, production, of, the, land, by, means, of, its, scarcity, contrary, to, this, concept, malthus, proposed, rent, to, be, a, kind, of, economic, surplus, the, debate, developed, over, the, economic, concept, of, a, general, glut, and, the, possibility, of, failure, of, say, s, law, malthus, laid, importance, on, economic, development, and, the, persistence, of, disequilibrium, the, context, was, the, post, war, depression, malthus, had, a, supporter, in, william, blake, in, denying, that, capital, accumulation, saving, was, always, good, in, such, circumstances, and, john, stuart, mill, attacked, blake, on, the, fringes, of, the, debate, ricardo, corresponded, with, malthus, from, 1817, about, his, principles, he, was, drawn, into, considering, political, economy, in, a, less, restricted, sense, which, might, be, adapted, to, legislation, and, its, multiple, objectives, by, the, thought, of, malthus, in, principles, of, political, economy, 1820, and, elsewhere, malthus, addressed, the, tension, amounting, to, conflict, he, saw, between, a, narrow, view, of, political, economy, and, the, broader, moral, and, political, plane, leslie, stephen, wrote, if, malthus, and, ricardo, differed, it, was, a, difference, of, men, who, accepted, the, same, first, principles, they, both, professed, to, interpret, adam, smith, as, the, true, prophet, and, represented, different, shades, of, opinion, rather, than, diverging, sects, it, is, now, considered, that, the, different, purposes, seen, by, malthus, and, ricardo, for, political, economy, affected, their, technical, discussion, and, contributed, to, the, lack, of, compatible, definitions, for, example, jean, baptiste, say, used, a, definition, of, production, based, on, goods, and, services, and, so, queried, the, restriction, of, malthus, to, goods, alone, in, terms, of, public, policy, malthus, was, a, supporter, of, the, protectionist, corn, laws, from, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, he, emerged, as, the, only, economist, of, note, to, support, duties, on, imported, grain, by, encouraging, domestic, production, malthus, argued, the, corn, laws, would, guarantee, british, self, sufficiency, in, food, malthus, was, a, founding, member, in, 1821, of, the, political, economy, club, where, john, cazenove, tended, to, be, his, ally, against, ricardo, and, mill, he, was, elected, in, the, beginning, of, 1824, as, one, of, the, ten, royal, associates, of, the, royal, society, of, literature, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, fellows, of, the, statistical, society, founded, in, march, 1834, in, 1827, he, gave, evidence, to, a, committee, of, the, house, of, commons, on, emigration, in, 1827, he, published, definitions, in, political, economy, the, first, chapter, put, forth, rules, for, the, definition, and, application, of, terms, in, political, economy, in, chapter, 10, the, penultimate, chapter, he, presented, 60, numbered, paragraphs, putting, forth, terms, and, their, definitions, that, he, proposed, should, be, used, in, discussing, political, economy, following, those, rules, this, collection, of, terms, and, definitions, is, remarkable, for, two, reasons, first, malthus, was, the, first, economist, to, explicitly, organize, define, and, publish, his, terms, as, a, coherent, glossary, of, defined, terms, and, second, his, definitions, were, for, the, most, part, well, formed, definitional, statements, between, these, chapters, he, criticised, several, contemporary, economists, jean, baptiste, say, david, ricardo, james, mill, john, ramsay, mcculloch, and, samuel, bailey, for, sloppiness, in, choosing, attaching, meaning, to, and, using, their, technical, terms, mcculloch, was, the, editor, of, the, scotsman, of, edinburgh, and, replied, cuttingly, in, a, review, printed, on, the, front, page, of, his, newspaper, in, march, 1827, he, implied, that, malthus, wanted, to, dictate, terms, and, theories, to, other, economists, mcculloch, clearly, felt, his, ox, gored, and, his, review, of, definitions, is, largely, a, bitter, defence, of, his, own, principles, of, political, economy, and, his, counter, attack, does, little, credit, to, his, reputation, being, largely, personal, derogation, of, malthus, the, purpose, of, malthus, s, definitions, was, terminological, clarity, and, malthus, discussed, appropriate, terms, their, definitions, and, their, use, by, himself, and, his, contemporaries, this, motivation, of, malthus, s, work, was, disregarded, by, mcculloch, who, responded, that, there, was, nothing, to, be, gained, by, carping, at, definitions, and, quibbling, about, the, meaning, to, be, attached, to, words, given, that, statement, it, is, not, surprising, that, mcculloch, s, review, failed, to, address, the, rules, of, chapter, 1, and, did, not, discuss, the, definitions, of, chapter, 10, he, also, barely, mentioned, malthus, s, critiques, of, other, writers, in, spite, of, this, and, in, the, wake, of, mcculloch, s, scathing, review, the, reputation, of, malthus, as, economist, dropped, away, for, the, rest, of, his, life, on, the, other, hand, malthus, did, have, supporters, including, thomas, chalmers, some, of, the, oriel, noetics, richard, jones, and, william, whewell, from, cambridge, malthus, died, suddenly, of, heart, disease, on, 23, december, 1834, at, his, father, in, law, s, house, he, was, buried, in, bath, abbey, his, portrait, and, descriptions, by, contemporaries, present, him, as, tall, and, good, looking, but, with, a, cleft, lip, and, palate, on, 13, march, 1804, thomas, malthus, married, harriet, eckersall, the, eldest, daughter, of, his, first, cousins, john, and, catherine, eckersall, who, lived, near, bath, harriet, became, well, known, at, haileybury, college, for, hosting, gatherings, of, notable, scientists, eleven, years, younger, than, thomas, she, survived, him, by, thirty, years, remarrying, after, his, death, the, couple, had, a, son, henry, and, two, daughters, emily, and, lucille, henry, the, eldest, became, vicar, of, effingham, surrey, in, 1835, and, of, donnington, sussex, in, 1837, he, married, sofia, otter, 1807, 1889, daughter, of, bishop, william, otter, and, died, in, august, 1882, aged, 76, emily, the, middle, child, died, in, 1885, outliving, her, parents, and, siblings, lucille, the, youngest, died, unmarried, and, childless, in, 1825, at, age, 17, malthus, argued, in, his, essay, 1798, that, population, growth, generally, expanded, in, times, and, in, regions, of, plenty, until, the, size, of, the, population, relative, to, the, primary, resources, caused, distress, yet, in, all, societies, even, those, that, are, most, vicious, the, tendency, to, a, virtuous, attachment, is, so, strong, that, there, is, a, constant, effort, towards, an, increase, of, population, this, constant, effort, as, constantly, tends, to, subject, the, lower, classes, of, the, society, to, distress, and, to, prevent, any, great, permanent, amelioration, of, their, condition, malthus, argued, that, two, types, of, checks, hold, population, within, resource, limits, positive, checks, which, raise, the, death, rate, and, preventive, ones, which, lower, the, birth, rate, the, positive, checks, include, hunger, disease, and, war, the, preventive, checks, birth, control, postponement, of, marriage, and, celibacy, the, rapid, increase, in, the, global, population, of, the, past, century, exemplifies, malthus, s, predicted, population, patterns, it, also, appears, to, describe, socio, demographic, dynamics, of, complex, pre, industrial, societies, these, findings, are, the, basis, for, neo, malthusian, modern, mathematical, models, of, long, term, historical, dynamics, malthus, wrote, that, in, a, period, of, resource, abundance, a, population, could, double, in, 25, years, however, the, margin, of, abundance, could, not, be, sustained, as, population, grew, leading, to, checks, on, population, growth, if, the, subsistence, for, man, that, the, earth, affords, was, to, be, increased, every, twenty, five, years, by, a, quantity, equal, to, what, the, whole, world, at, present, produces, this, would, allow, the, power, of, production, in, the, earth, to, be, absolutely, unlimited, and, its, ratio, of, increase, much, greater, than, we, can, conceive, that, any, possible, exertions, of, mankind, could, make, it, yet, still, the, power, of, population, being, a, power, of, a, superior, order, the, increase, of, the, human, species, can, only, be, kept, commensurate, to, the, increase, of, the, means, of, subsistence, by, the, constant, operation, of, the, strong, law, of, necessity, acting, as, a, check, upon, the, greater, power, in, later, editions, of, his, essay, malthus, clarified, his, view, that, if, society, relied, on, human, misery, to, limit, population, growth, then, sources, of, misery, e, g, hunger, disease, and, war, would, inevitably, afflict, society, as, would, volatile, economic, cycles, on, the, other, hand, preventive, checks, to, population, that, limited, birthrates, such, as, later, marriages, could, ensure, a, higher, standard, of, living, for, all, while, also, increasing, economic, stability, regarding, possibilities, for, freeing, man, from, these, limits, malthus, argued, against, a, variety, of, imaginable, solutions, such, as, the, notion, that, agricultural, improvements, could, expand, without, limit, of, the, relationship, between, population, and, economics, malthus, wrote, that, when, the, population, of, laborers, grows, faster, than, the, production, of, food, real, wages, fall, because, the, growing, population, causes, the, cost, of, living, i, e, the, cost, of, food, to, go, up, difficulties, of, raising, a, family, eventually, reduce, the, rate, of, population, growth, until, the, falling, population, again, leads, to, higher, real, wages, in, the, second, and, subsequent, editions, malthus, put, more, emphasis, on, moral, restraint, as, the, best, means, of, easing, the, poverty, of, the, lower, classes, in, this, work, his, first, published, pamphlet, malthus, argues, against, the, notion, prevailing, in, his, locale, that, the, greed, of, intermediaries, caused, the, high, price, of, provisions, instead, malthus, says, that, the, high, price, stems, from, the, poor, laws, which, increase, the, parish, allowances, in, proportion, to, the, price, of, corn, thus, given, a, limited, supply, the, poor, laws, force, up, the, price, of, daily, necessities, however, he, concludes, by, saying, that, in, time, of, scarcity, such, poor, laws, by, raising, the, price, of, corn, more, evenly, actually, produce, a, beneficial, effect, although, government, in, britain, had, regulated, the, prices, of, grain, the, corn, laws, originated, in, 1815, at, the, end, of, the, napoleonic, wars, that, year, parliament, passed, legislation, banning, the, importation, of, foreign, corn, into, britain, until, domestic, corn, cost, 80, shillings, per, quarter, the, high, price, caused, the, cost, of, food, to, increase, and, caused, distress, among, the, working, classes, in, the, towns, it, led, to, serious, rioting, in, london, and, to, the, peterloo, massacre, in, manchester, in, 1819, in, this, pamphlet, printed, during, the, parliamentary, discussion, malthus, tentatively, supported, the, free, traders, he, argued, that, given, the, increasing, cost, of, growing, british, corn, advantages, accrued, from, supplementing, it, from, cheaper, foreign, sources, in, 1820, malthus, published, principles, of, political, economy, a, second, edition, was, posthumously, published, in, 1836, malthus, intended, this, work, to, rival, ricardo, s, principles, 1817, it, and, his, 1827, definitions, in, political, economy, defended, sismondi, s, views, on, general, glut, rather, than, say, s, law, which, in, effect, states, there, can, be, no, general, glut, malthus, developed, the, theory, of, demand, supply, mismatches, that, he, called, gluts, discounted, at, the, time, this, theory, foreshadowed, later, work, by, an, admirer, john, maynard, keynes, the, vast, bulk, of, continuing, commentary, on, malthus, however, extends, and, expands, on, the, malthusian, controversy, of, the, early, 19th, century, in, ireland, where, writing, to, ricardo, in, 1817, malthus, proposed, that, to, give, full, effect, to, the, natural, resources, of, the, country, a, great, part, of, the, population, should, be, swept, from, the, soil, into, large, manufacturing, and, commercial, towns, a, comparatively, early, contribution, was, observations, on, the, population, and, resources, of, ireland, 1821, by, the, polymath, and, physician, whitely, stokes, finding, fault, in, malthus, s, calculations, and, juxtapositions, the, possible, increase, of, man, in, america, measured, against, the, probable, increase, in, production, in, great, britain, and, insisting, upon, the, advantages, mankind, derives, from, improved, industry, improved, conveyance, improvements, in, morals, government, and, religion, stokes, argued, that, ireland, s, difficulty, lay, not, in, her, numbers, but, in, indifferent, government, the, epitaph, of, malthus, in, bath, abbey, reads, sacred, to, the, memory, of, the, rev, thomas, robert, malthus, long, known, to, the, lettered, world, by, his, admirable, writings, on, the, social, branches, of, political, economy, particularly, by, his, essay, on, population, one, of, the, best, men, and, truest, philosophers, of, any, age, or, country, raised, by, native, dignity, of, mind, above, the, misrepresentations, of, the, ignorant, and, the, neglect, of, the, great, he, lived, a, serene, and, happy, life, devoted, to, the, pursuit, and, communication, of, truth, supported, by, a, calm, but, firm, conviction, of, the, usefulness, of, his, labors, content, with, the, approbation, of, the, wise, and, good, his, writings, will, be, a, lasting, monument, of, the, extent, and, correctness, of, his, understanding, the, spotless, integrity, of, his, principles, the, equity, and, candour, of, his, nature, his, sweetness, of, temper, urbanity, of, manners, and, tenderness, of, heart, his, benevolence, and, his, piety, are, the, still, dearer, recollections, of, his, family, and, friends, born, 14, february, 1766, died, 29, december, 1834
