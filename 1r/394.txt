bridge, which, probably, saved, his, life, and, those, of, his, companions, he, arrived, in, paris, in, 1813, largely, unaware, of, the, general, fiasco, that, the, retreat, had, become, stendhal, became, known, during, the, russian, campaign, for, keeping, his, wits, about, him, and, maintaining, his, sang, froid, and, clear, headedness, he, also, maintained, his, daily, routine, shaving,

days, is, set, in, italy, which, he, considered, a, more, sincere, and, passionate, country, than, restoration, france, an, aside, in, that, novel, referring, to, a, character, who, contemplates, suicide, after, being, jilted, speaks, about, his, attitude, towards, his, home, country, to, make, this, course, of, action, clear, to, my, french, readers, i, must, explain, that, in, italy, a, country, very, far, away, from, us, people, are, still, driven, to, despair, by, love, stendhal, identified, with, the, nascent, liberalism, and, his, sojourn, in, italy, convinced, him, that, romanticism, was, essentially, the, literary, counterpart, of, liberalism, in, politics, when, stendhal, was, appointed, to, a, consular, post, in, trieste, in, 1830, metternich, refused, his, exequatur, on, account, of, stendhal, s, liberalism, and, anti, clericalism, stendhal, was, a, dandy, and, wit, about, town, in, paris, as, well, as, an, obsessive, womaniser, his, genuine, empathy, towards, women, is, evident, in, his, books, simone, de, beauvoir, spoke, highly, of, him, in, the, second, sex, she, credited, him, for, perceiving, a, woman, as, just, a, woman, and, simply, a, human, being, citing, stendhal, s, rebellious, heroines, she, maintained, that, he, was, a, feminist, writer, one, of, his, early, works, is, on, love, a, rational, analysis, of, romantic, passion, that, was, based, on, his, unrequited, love, for, mathilde, countess, dembowska, whom, he, met, while, living, at, milan, later, he, would, also, suffer, restlessness, in, spirit, when, one, of, his, childhood, friends, victorine, got, married, in, a, letter, to, pauline, he, described, her, as, the, woman, of, his, dreams, and, wrote, that, he, would, have, discovered, happiness, if, he, became, her, husband, this, fusion, of, and, tension, between, clear, headed, analysis, and, romantic, feeling, is, typical, of, stendhal, s, great, novels, he, could, be, considered, a, romantic, realist, stendhal, suffered, miserable, physical, disabilities, in, his, final, years, as, he, continued, to, produce, some, of, his, most, famous, work, he, contracted, syphilis, in, december, 1808, as, he, noted, in, his, journal, he, was, taking, iodide, of, potassium, and, quicksilver, to, treat, his, sexual, disease, resulting, in, swollen, armpits, difficulty, swallowing, pains, in, his, shrunken, testicles, sleeplessness, giddiness, roaring, in, the, ears, racing, pulse, and, tremors, so, bad, he, could, scarcely, hold, a, fork, or, a, pen, modern, medicine, has, shown, that, his, health, problems, were, more, attributable, to, his, treatment, than, to, his, syphilis, he, is, said, to, have, sought, the, best, treatment, in, paris, vienna, and, rome, stendhal, died, on, 23, march, 1842, a, few, hours, after, collapsing, with, a, seizure, in, the, street, in, paris, he, is, interred, in, the, cimeti, re, de, montmartre, before, settling, on, the, pen, name, stendhal, he, published, under, many, pen, names, including, louis, alexandre, bombet, and, anastasius, serpi, re, the, only, book, that, stendhal, published, under, his, own, name, was, the, history, of, painting, 1817, from, the, publication, of, rome, naples, florence, september, 1817, onwards, he, published, his, works, under, the, pseudonym, m, de, stendhal, officier, de, cavalerie, he, borrowed, this, pen, name, from, the, german, city, of, stendal, birthplace, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, an, art, historian, and, archaeologist, famous, at, the, time, however, it, is, not, clear, whether, he, chose, the, name, in, honour, of, winckelmann, or, simply, knew, the, place, as, a, centre, of, communications, between, berlin, and, hanover, stendhal, added, an, additional, h, to, make, the, germanic, pronunciation, more, clear, stendhal, used, many, aliases, in, his, autobiographical, writings, and, correspondence, and, often, assigned, pseudonyms, to, friends, some, of, whom, adopted, the, names, for, themselves, stendhal, used, more, than, a, hundred, pseudonyms, which, were, astonishingly, diverse, some, he, used, no, more, than, once, while, others, he, returned, to, throughout, his, life, dominique, and, salviati, served, as, intimate, pet, names, he, coins, comic, names, that, make, him, even, more, bourgeois, than, he, really, is, cotonnet, bombet, chamier, 80, he, uses, many, ridiculous, names, don, phlegm, giorgio, vasari, william, crocodile, poverino, baron, de, cutendre, one, of, his, correspondents, prosper, m, rim, e, said, he, never, wrote, a, letter, without, signing, a, false, name, stendhal, s, journal, and, autobiographical, writings, include, many, comments, on, masks, and, the, pleasures, of, feeling, alive, in, many, versions, look, upon, life, as, a, masked, ball, is, the, advice, that, stendhal, gives, himself, in, his, diary, for, 1814, 85, in, memoirs, of, an, egotist, he, writes, will, i, be, believed, if, i, say, i, d, wear, a, mask, with, pleasure, and, be, delighted, to, change, my, name, for, me, the, supreme, happiness, would, be, to, change, into, a, lanky, blonde, german, and, to, walk, about, like, that, in, paris, contemporary, readers, did, not, fully, appreciate, stendhal, s, realistic, style, during, the, romantic, period, in, which, he, lived, he, was, not, fully, appreciated, until, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, he, dedicated, his, writing, to, the, happy, few, in, english, in, the, original, this, can, be, interpreted, as, a, reference, to, canto, 11, of, lord, byron, s, don, juan, which, refers, to, the, thousand, happy, few, who, enjoy, high, society, or, to, the, we, few, we, happy, few, we, band, of, brothers, line, of, william, shakespeare, s, henry, v, but, stendhal, s, use, more, likely, refers, to, the, vicar, of, wakefield, by, oliver, goldsmith, parts, of, which, he, had, memorized, in, the, course, of, teaching, himself, english, in, the, vicar, of, wakefield, the, happy, few, refers, ironically, to, the, small, number, of, people, who, read, the, title, character, s, obscure, and, pedantic, treatise, on, monogamy, as, a, literary, critic, such, as, in, racine, and, shakespeare, stendhal, championed, the, romantic, aesthetic, by, unfavorably, comparing, the, rules, and, strictures, of, jean, racine, s, classicism, to, the, freer, verse, and, settings, of, shakespeare, and, supporting, the, writing, of, plays, in, prose, according, to, the, literary, theorist, kornelije, kvas, in, his, novel, the, red, and, the, black, stendhal, refers, to, a, novel, as, a, mirror, being, carried, in, a, basket, the, metaphor, of, the, realistic, novel, as, a, mirror, of, contemporary, reality, accessible, to, the, narrator, has, certain, limitations, which, the, artist, is, aware, of, a, valuable, realistic, work, exceeds, the, platonic, meaning, of, art, as, a, copy, of, reality, a, mirror, does, not, reflect, reality, in, its, entirety, nor, is, the, artist, s, aim, to, document, it, fully, in, the, red, and, the, black, the, writer, emphasizes, the, significance, of, selection, when, it, comes, to, describing, reality, with, a, view, to, realizing, the, cognitive, function, of, a, work, of, art, achieved, through, the, categories, of, unity, coherence, and, typicality, stendhal, was, an, admirer, of, napoleon, and, his, novel, le, rouge, et, le, noir, is, considered, his, literary, tribute, to, the, emperor, today, stendhal, s, works, attract, attention, for, their, irony, and, psychological, and, historical, dimensions, stendhal, was, an, avid, fan, of, music, particularly, the, works, of, the, composers, domenico, cimarosa, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, and, gioacchino, rossini, he, wrote, a, biography, of, rossini, vie, de, rossini, 1824, now, more, valued, for, its, wide, ranging, musical, criticism, than, for, its, historical, content, he, also, idealized, aristocracy, noting, its, antiegalitarianism, but, appreciating, how, it, is, liberal, in, its, love, of, liberty, in, his, works, stendhal, reprised, excerpts, appropriated, from, giuseppe, carpani, th, ophile, fr, d, ric, winckler, sismondi, and, others, stendhal, s, brief, memoir, souvenirs, d, gotisme, memoirs, of, an, egotist, was, published, posthumously, in, 1892, also, published, was, a, more, extended, autobiographical, work, thinly, disguised, as, the, life, of, henry, brulard, his, other, works, include, short, stories, journalism, travel, books, a, roman, journal, a, famous, collection, of, essays, on, italian, painting, and, biographies, of, several, prominent, figures, of, his, time, including, napoleon, haydn, mozart, rossini, and, metastasio, in, stendhal, s, 1822, classic, on, love, he, describes, or, compares, the, birth, of, love, in, which, the, love, object, is, crystallized, in, the, mind, as, being, a, process, similar, or, analogous, to, a, trip, to, rome, in, the, analogy, the, city, of, bologna, represents, indifference, and, rome, represents, perfect, love, when, we, are, in, bologna, we, are, entirely, indifferent, we, are, not, concerned, to, admire, in, any, particular, way, the, person, with, whom, we, shall, perhaps, one, day, be, madly, in, love, even, less, is, our, imagination, inclined, to, overrate, their, worth, in, a, word, in, bologna, crystallization, has, not, yet, begun, when, the, journey, begins, love, departs, one, leaves, bologna, climbs, the, apennines, and, takes, the, road, to, rome, the, departure, according, to, stendhal, has, nothing, to, do, with, one, s, will, it, is, an, instinctive, moment, this, transformative, process, actuates, in, terms, of, four, steps, along, a, journey, this, journey, or, crystallization, process, shown, above, was, detailed, by, stendhal, on, the, back, of, a, playing, card, while, speaking, to, madame, gherardi, during, his, trip, to, the, salzburg, salt, mine, hippolyte, taine, considered, the, psychological, portraits, of, stendhal, s, characters, to, be, real, because, they, are, complex, many, sided, particular, and, original, like, living, human, beings, mile, zola, concurred, with, taine, s, assessment, of, stendhal, s, skills, as, a, psychologist, and, although, emphatic, in, his, praise, of, stendhal, s, psychological, accuracy, and, rejection, of, convention, he, deplored, the, various, implausibilities, of, the, novels, and, stendhal, s, clear, authorial, intervention, the, german, philosopher, friedrich, nietzsche, refers, to, stendhal, as, france, s, last, great, psychologist, in, beyond, good, and, evil, 1886, he, also, mentions, stendhal, in, the, twilight, of, the, idols, 1889, during, a, discussion, of, dostoevsky, as, a, psychologist, saying, that, encountering, dostoevsky, was, the, most, beautiful, accident, of, my, life, more, so, than, even, my, discovery, of, stendhal, ford, madox, ford, in, the, english, novel, asserts, that, to, diderot, and, stendhal, the, novel, owes, its, next, great, step, forward, at, that, point, it, became, suddenly, evident, that, the, novel, as, such, was, capable, of, being, regarded, as, a, means, of, profoundly, serious, and, many, sided, discussion, and, therefore, as, a, medium, of, profoundly, serious, investigation, into, the, human, case, erich, auerbach, considers, modern, serious, realism, to, have, begun, with, stendhal, and, balzac, in, mimesis, he, remarks, of, a, scene, in, the, red, and, the, black, that, it, would, be, almost, incomprehensible, without, a, most, accurate, and, detailed, knowledge, of, the, political, situation, the, social, stratification, and, the, economic, circumstances, of, a, perfectly, definite, historical, moment, namely, that, in, which, france, found, itself, just, before, the, july, revolution, in, auerbach, s, view, in, stendhal, s, novels, characters, attitudes, and, relationships, of, the, dramatis, person, then, are, very, closely, connected, with, contemporary, historical, circumstances, contemporary, political, and, social, conditions, are, woven, into, the, action, in, a, manner, more, detailed, and, more, real, than, had, been, exhibited, in, any, earlier, novel, and, indeed, in, any, works, of, literary, art, except, those, expressly, purporting, to, be, politico, satirical, tracts, simone, de, beauvoir, uses, stendhal, as, an, example, of, a, feminist, author, in, the, second, sex, de, beauvoir, writes, stendhal, never, describes, his, heroines, as, a, function, of, his, heroes, he, provides, them, with, their, own, destinies, she, furthermore, points, out, that, it, is, remarkable, that, stendhal, is, both, so, profoundly, romantic, and, so, decidedly, feminist, feminists, are, usually, rational, minds, that, adopt, a, universal, point, of, view, in, all, things, but, it, is, not, only, in, the, name, of, freedom, in, general, but, also, in, the, name, of, individual, happiness, that, stendhal, calls, for, women, s, emancipation, yet, beauvoir, criticises, stendhal, for, although, wanting, a, woman, to, be, his, equal, her, only, destiny, he, envisions, for, her, remains, a, man, even, stendhal, s, autobiographical, works, such, as, the, life, of, henry, brulard, or, memoirs, of, an, egotist, are, far, more, closely, essentially, and, concretely, connected, with, the, politics, sociology, and, economics, of, the, period, than, are, for, example, the, corresponding, works, of, rousseau, or, goethe, one, feels, that, the, great, events, of, contemporary, history, affected, stendhal, much, more, directly, than, they, did, the, other, two, rousseau, did, not, live, to, see, them, and, goethe, had, managed, to, keep, aloof, from, them, auerbach, goes, on, to, say, we, may, ask, ourselves, how, it, came, about, that, modern, consciousness, of, reality, began, to, find, literary, form, for, the, first, time, precisely, in, henri, beyle, of, grenoble, beyle, stendhal, was, a, man, of, keen, intelligence, quick, and, alive, mentally, independent, and, courageous, but, not, quite, a, great, figure, his, ideas, are, often, forceful, and, inspired, but, they, are, erratic, arbitrarily, advanced, and, despite, all, their, show, of, boldness, lacking, in, inward, certainty, and, continuity, there, is, something, unsettled, about, his, whole, nature, his, fluctuation, between, realistic, candor, in, general, and, silly, mystification, in, particulars, between, cold, self, control, rapturous, abandonment, to, sensual, pleasures, and, insecure, and, sometimes, sentimental, vaingloriousness, is, not, always, easy, to, put, up, with, his, literary, style, is, very, impressive, and, unmistakably, original, but, it, is, short, winded, not, uniformly, successful, and, only, seldom, wholly, takes, possession, of, and, fixes, the, subject, but, such, as, he, was, he, offered, himself, to, the, moment, circumstances, seized, him, tossed, him, about, and, laid, upon, him, a, unique, and, unexpected, destiny, they, formed, him, so, that, he, was, compelled, to, come, to, terms, with, reality, in, a, way, which, no, one, had, done, before, him, vladimir, nabokov, was, dismissive, of, stendhal, in, strong, opinions, calling, him, that, pet, of, all, those, who, like, their, french, plain, in, the, notes, to, his, translation, of, eugene, onegin, he, asserts, that, le, rouge, et, le, noir, is, much, overrated, and, that, stendhal, has, a, paltry, style, in, pnin, nabokov, wrote, satirically, literary, departments, still, labored, under, the, impression, that, stendhal, galsworthy, dreiser, and, mann, were, great, writers, michael, dirda, considers, stendhal, the, greatest, all, round, french, writer, author, of, two, of, the, top, 20, french, novels, author, of, a, highly, original, autobiography, vie, de, henry, brulard, a, superb, travel, writer, and, as, inimitable, a, presence, on, the, page, as, any, writer, you, ll, ever, meet, in, 1817, stendhal, was, reportedly, overcome, by, the, cultural, richness, of, florence, he, encountered, when, he, first, visited, the, tuscan, city, as, he, described, in, his, book, naples, and, florence, a, journey, from, milan, to, reggio, as, i, emerged, from, the, porch, of, santa, croce, i, was, seized, with, a, fierce, palpitation, of, the, heart, that, same, symptom, which, in, berlin, is, referred, to, as, an, attack, of, the, nerves, the, well, spring, of, life, was, dried, up, within, me, and, i, walked, in, constant, fear, of, falling, to, the, ground, the, condition, was, diagnosed, and, named, in, 1979, by, italian, psychiatrist, graziella, magherini, who, had, noticed, similar, psychosomatic, conditions, racing, heart, beat, nausea, and, dizziness, amongst, first, time, visitors, to, the, city, in, homage, to, stendhal, trenitalia, named, their, overnight, train, service, from, paris, to, venice, the, stendhal, express, though, there, is, no, physical, distress, connected, to, it, category
