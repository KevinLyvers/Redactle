grace, brewster, hopper, n, e, murray, december, 9, 1906, january, 1, 1992, was, an, american, computer, scientist, mathematician, and, united, states, navy, rear, admiral, she, was, a, pioneer, of, computer, programming, hopper, was, the, first, to, devise, the, theory, of, machine, independent, programming, languages, and, used, this, theory, to, develop, the, flow, matic, programming, language, and, cobol, an, early, high, level, programming, language, still, in, use, today, she, was, also, one, of, the, first, programmers, on, the, harvard, mark, i, computer, she, is, credited, with, writing, the, first, computer, manual, a, manual, of, operation, for, the, automatic, sequence, controlled, calculator, before, joining, the, navy, hopper, earned, a, ph, d, in, both, mathematics, and, mathematical, physics, from, yale, university, and, was, a, professor, of, mathematics, at, vassar, college, she, left, her, position, at, vassar, to, join, the, united, states, navy, reserve, during, world, war, ii, hopper, began, her, computing, career, in, 1944, as, a, member, of, the, harvard, mark, i, team, led, by, howard, h, aiken, in, 1949, she, joined, the, eckert, mauchly, computer, corporation, and, was, part, of, the, team, that, developed, the, univac, i, computer, at, eckert, mauchly, she, managed, the, development, of, one, of, the, first, cobol, compilers, she, believed, that, programming, should, be, simplified, with, an, english, based, computer, programming, language, her, compiler, converted, english, terms, into, machine, code, understood, by, computers, by, 1952, hopper, had, finished, her, program, linker, originally, called, a, compiler, which, was, written, for, the, a, 0, system, in, 1954, eckert, mauchly, chose, hopper, to, lead, their, department, for, automatic, programming, and, she, led, the, release, of, some, of, the, first, compiled, languages, like, flow, matic, in, 1959, she, participated, in, the, codasyl, consortium, helping, to, create, a, machine, independent, programming, language, called, cobol, language, which, was, based, on, english, words, hopper, promoted, the, use, of, the, language, throughout, the, 60s, the, u, s, navy, arleigh, burke, class, guided, missile, destroyer, uss, hopper, was, named, for, her, as, was, the, cray, xe6, hopper, supercomputer, at, nersc, and, nvidia, superchip, grace, hopper, during, her, lifetime, hopper, was, awarded, 40, honorary, degrees, from, universities, across, the, world, a, college, at, yale, university, was, renamed, in, her, honor, in, 1991, she, received, the, national, medal, of, technology, on, november, 22, 2016, she, was, posthumously, awarded, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, by, president, barack, obama, in, 2024, the, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, ieee, dedicated, a, marker, in, honor, of, grace, hopper, at, the, university, of, pennsylvania, for, her, role, in, inventing, the, a, 0, compiler, during, her, time, as, a, lecturer, in, the, school, of, engineering, citing, her, inspirational, impact, on, young, engineers, grace, brewster, murray, was, born, in, new, york, city, she, was, the, eldest, of, three, children, her, parents, walter, fletcher, murray, and, mary, campbell, van, horne, were, of, scottish, and, dutch, descent, and, attended, west, end, collegiate, church, her, great, grandfather, alexander, wilson, russell, an, admiral, in, the, us, navy, fought, in, the, battle, of, mobile, bay, during, the, civil, war, 2, 3, grace, was, very, curious, as, a, child, this, was, a, lifelong, trait, at, the, age, of, seven, she, decided, to, determine, how, an, alarm, clock, worked, and, dismantled, seven, alarm, clocks, before, her, mother, realized, what, she, was, doing, she, was, then, limited, to, one, clock, later, in, life, she, was, known, for, keeping, a, clock, that, ran, backward, she, explained, humans, are, allergic, to, change, they, love, to, say, we, ve, always, done, it, this, way, i, try, to, fight, that, that, s, why, i, have, a, clock, on, my, wall, that, runs, counterclockwise, for, her, preparatory, school, education, she, attended, the, hartridge, school, in, plainfield, new, jersey, grace, was, initially, rejected, for, early, admission, to, vassar, college, at, age, 16, because, her, test, scores, in, latin, were, too, low, but, she, was, admitted, the, next, year, she, graduated, phi, beta, kappa, from, vassar, in, 1928, with, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, mathematics, and, physics, and, earned, her, master, s, degree, at, yale, university, in, 1930, in, 1930, grace, murray, married, new, york, university, professor, vincent, foster, hopper, 1906, 1976, they, divorced, in, 1945, she, did, not, marry, again, and, retained, his, surname, in, 1934, hopper, earned, a, ph, d, in, mathematics, from, yale, under, the, direction, of, ystein, ore, her, dissertation, new, types, of, irreducibility, criteria, was, published, that, same, year, she, began, teaching, mathematics, at, vassar, in, 1931, and, was, promoted, to, associate, professor, in, 1941, hopper, tried, to, be, commissioned, in, the, navy, early, in, world, war, ii, however, she, was, turned, down, at, age, 34, she, was, too, old, to, enlist, and, her, weight, to, height, ratio, was, too, low, she, was, also, denied, on, the, basis, that, her, job, as, a, mathematician, and, mathematics, professor, at, vassar, college, was, valuable, to, the, war, effort, during, the, war, in, 1943, hopper, obtained, a, leave, of, absence, from, vassar, and, was, sworn, into, the, united, states, navy, reserve, she, was, one, of, many, women, who, volunteered, to, serve, in, the, waves, she, had, to, get, an, exemption, to, be, commissioned, she, was, 15, pounds, 6, 8, kg, below, the, navy, minimum, weight, of, 120, pounds, 54, kg, she, reported, in, december, and, trained, at, the, naval, reserve, midshipmen, s, school, at, smith, college, in, northampton, massachusetts, hopper, graduated, first, in, her, class, in, 1944, and, was, assigned, to, the, bureau, of, ships, computation, project, at, harvard, university, as, a, lieutenant, junior, grade, she, served, on, the, mark, i, computer, programming, staff, headed, by, howard, h, aiken, hopper, and, aiken, co, authored, three, papers, on, the, mark, i, also, known, as, the, automatic, sequence, controlled, calculator, hopper, s, request, to, transfer, to, the, regular, navy, at, the, end, of, the, war, was, declined, due, to, her, advanced, age, of, 38, she, continued, to, serve, in, the, navy, reserve, hopper, remained, at, the, harvard, computation, lab, until, 1949, turning, down, a, full, professorship, at, vassar, in, favor, of, working, as, a, research, fellow, under, a, navy, contract, at, harvard, in, 1949, hopper, became, an, employee, of, the, eckert, mauchly, computer, corporation, as, a, senior, mathematician, and, joined, the, team, developing, the, univac, i, hopper, also, served, as, univac, director, of, automatic, programming, development, for, remington, rand, the, univac, was, the, first, known, large, scale, electronic, computer, to, be, on, the, market, in, 1950, and, was, more, competitive, at, processing, information, than, the, mark, i, when, hopper, recommended, the, development, of, a, new, programming, language, that, would, use, entirely, english, words, she, was, told, very, quickly, that, couldn, t, do, this, because, computers, didn, t, understand, english, still, she, persisted, it, s, much, easier, for, most, people, to, write, an, english, statement, than, it, is, to, use, symbols, she, explained, so, i, decided, data, processors, ought, to, be, able, to, write, their, programs, in, english, and, the, computers, would, translate, them, into, machine, code, her, idea, was, not, accepted, for, three, years, in, the, meantime, she, published, her, first, paper, on, the, subject, compilers, in, 1952, in, the, early, 1950s, the, company, was, taken, over, by, the, remington, rand, corporation, and, it, was, while, she, was, working, for, them, that, her, original, compiler, work, was, done, the, program, was, known, as, the, a, compiler, and, its, first, version, was, a, 0, 11, in, 1952, she, had, an, operational, link, loader, which, at, the, time, was, referred, to, as, a, compiler, she, later, said, that, nobody, believed, that, and, that, she, had, a, running, compiler, and, nobody, would, touch, it, they, told, me, computers, could, only, do, arithmetic, in, 1954, hopper, was, named, the, company, s, first, director, of, automatic, programming, beginning, in, 1954, hopper, s, work, was, influenced, by, the, laning, and, zierler, system, which, was, the, first, compiler, to, accept, algebraic, notation, as, input, her, department, released, some, of, the, first, compiler, based, programming, languages, including, math, matic, and, flow, matic, hopper, said, that, her, compiler, a, 0, translated, mathematical, notation, into, machine, code, manipulating, symbols, was, fine, for, mathematicians, but, it, was, no, good, for, data, processors, who, were, not, symbol, manipulators, very, few, people, are, really, symbol, manipulators, if, they, are, they, become, professional, mathematicians, not, data, processors, it, s, much, easier, for, most, people, to, write, an, english, statement, than, it, is, to, use, symbols, so, i, decided, data, processors, ought, to, be, able, to, write, their, programs, in, english, and, the, computers, would, translate, them, into, machine, code, that, was, the, beginning, of, cobol, a, computer, language, for, data, processors, i, could, say, subtract, income, tax, from, pay, instead, of, trying, to, write, that, in, octal, code, or, using, all, kinds, of, symbols, cobol, is, the, major, language, used, today, in, data, processing, in, the, spring, of, 1959, computer, experts, from, industry, and, government, were, brought, together, in, a, two, day, conference, known, as, the, conference, on, data, systems, languages, codasyl, hopper, served, as, a, technical, consultant, to, the, committee, and, many, of, her, former, employees, served, on, the, short, term, committee, that, defined, the, new, language, cobol, an, acronym, for, co, mmon, b, usiness, o, riented, l, anguage, the, new, language, extended, hopper, s, flow, matic, language, with, some, ideas, from, the, ibm, equivalent, comtran, hopper, s, belief, that, programs, should, be, written, in, a, language, that, was, close, to, english, rather, than, in, machine, code, or, in, languages, close, to, machine, code, such, as, assembly, languages, was, captured, in, the, new, business, language, and, cobol, went, on, to, be, the, most, ubiquitous, business, language, to, date, among, the, members, of, the, committee, that, worked, on, cobol, was, mount, holyoke, college, alumna, jean, e, sammet, from, 1967, to, 1977, hopper, served, as, the, director, of, the, navy, programming, languages, group, in, the, navy, s, office, of, information, systems, planning, and, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, captain, in, 1973, she, developed, validation, software, for, cobol, and, its, compiler, as, part, of, a, cobol, standardization, program, for, the, entire, navy, in, the, 1970s, hopper, advocated, for, the, defense, department, to, replace, large, centralized, systems, with, networks, of, small, distributed, computers, any, user, on, any, computer, node, could, access, common, databases, on, the, network, 119, she, developed, the, implementation, of, standards, for, testing, computer, systems, and, components, most, significantly, for, early, programming, languages, such, as, fortran, and, cobol, the, navy, tests, for, conformance, to, these, standards, led, to, significant, convergence, among, the, programming, language, dialects, of, the, major, computer, vendors, in, the, 1980s, these, tests, and, their, official, administration, were, assumed, by, the, national, bureau, of, standards, nbs, known, today, as, the, national, institute, of, standards, and, technology, nist, in, accordance, with, navy, attrition, regulations, hopper, retired, from, the, naval, reserve, with, the, rank, of, commander, at, age, 60, at, the, end, of, 1966, she, was, recalled, to, active, duty, in, august, 1967, for, a, six, month, period, that, turned, into, an, indefinite, assignment, she, again, retired, in, 1971, but, was, again, asked, to, return, to, active, duty, in, 1972, she, was, promoted, to, captain, in, 1973, by, admiral, elmo, r, zumwalt, jr, after, republican, representative, philip, crane, saw, her, on, a, march, 1983, segment, of, 60, minutes, he, championed, a, joint, resolution, to, promote, hopper, to, commodore, on, the, retired, list, the, resolution, was, referred, to, but, not, reported, out, of, the, senate, armed, services, committee, hopper, was, instead, promoted, to, commodore, on, december, 15, 1983, via, the, appointments, clause, by, president, ronald, reagan, she, remained, on, active, duty, for, several, years, beyond, mandatory, retirement, by, special, approval, of, congress, effective, november, 8, 1985, the, rank, of, commodore, was, renamed, rear, admiral, lower, half, and, hopper, became, one, of, the, navy, s, few, female, admirals, after, a, career, that, spanned, more, than, 42, years, hopper, retired, from, the, navy, on, august, 14, 1986, at, the, time, she, was, the, oldest, serving, member, of, the, navy, at, a, celebration, held, in, boston, on, the, uss, constitution, to, commemorate, her, retirement, hopper, was, awarded, the, defense, distinguished, service, medal, the, highest, non, combat, decoration, awarded, by, the, department, of, defense, at, the, time, of, her, retirement, she, was, the, oldest, active, duty, commissioned, officer, in, the, united, states, navy, 79, years, eight, months, and, five, days, and, had, her, retirement, ceremony, aboard, the, oldest, commissioned, ship, in, the, united, states, navy, 188, years, 9, months, 23, days, after, her, retirement, from, the, navy, hopper, was, hired, as, a, senior, consultant, to, digital, equipment, corporation, dec, hopper, was, initially, offered, a, position, by, rita, yavinsky, but, she, insisted, on, going, through, the, typical, formal, interview, process, she, then, proposed, in, jest, that, she, would, be, willing, to, accept, a, position, which, made, her, available, on, alternating, thursdays, exhibited, at, their, museum, of, computing, as, a, pioneer, in, exchange, for, a, generous, salary, and, unlimited, expense, account, instead, she, was, hired, as, a, full, time, principal, corporate, consulting, engineer, a, tech, track, svp, equivalent, in, this, position, hopper, represented, the, company, at, industry, forums, serving, on, various, industry, committees, along, with, other, obligations, she, retained, that, position, until, her, death, at, age, 85, in, 1992, at, dec, hopper, served, primarily, as, a, goodwill, ambassador, she, lectured, widely, about, the, early, days, of, computing, her, career, and, on, efforts, that, computer, vendors, could, take, to, make, life, easier, for, their, users, she, visited, most, of, digital, s, engineering, facilities, where, she, generally, received, a, standing, ovation, at, the, conclusion, of, her, remarks, although, no, longer, a, serving, officer, she, always, wore, her, navy, full, dress, uniform, to, these, lectures, contrary, to, u, s, department, of, defense, policy, in, 2016, hopper, received, the, presidential, medal, of, freedom, the, nation, s, highest, civilian, honor, in, recognition, of, her, remarkable, contributions, to, the, field, of, computer, science, the, most, important, thing, i, ve, accomplished, other, than, building, the, compiler, she, said, is, training, young, people, they, come, to, me, you, know, and, say, do, you, think, we, can, do, this, i, say, try, it, and, i, back, em, up, they, need, that, i, keep, track, of, them, as, they, get, older, and, i, stir, em, up, at, intervals, so, they, don, t, forget, to, take, chances, throughout, much, of, her, later, career, hopper, was, much, in, demand, as, a, speaker, at, various, computer, related, events, she, was, well, known, for, her, lively, and, irreverent, speaking, style, as, well, as, a, rich, treasury, of, early, war, stories, she, also, received, the, nickname, grandma, cobol, while, hopper, was, working, on, a, mark, ii, computer, at, harvard, university, in, 1947, her, associates, discovered, a, moth, that, was, stuck, in, a, relay, and, impeding, the, operation, of, the, computer, upon, extraction, the, insect, was, affixed, to, a, log, sheet, for, that, day, with, the, notation, first, actual, case, of, bug, being, found, while, neither, she, nor, her, crew, members, mentioned, the, exact, phrase, debugging, in, their, log, entries, the, case, is, held, as, a, historical, instance, of, debugging, a, computer, and, hopper, is, credited, with, popularizing, the, term, in, computing, for, many, decades, the, term, bug, for, a, malfunction, had, been, in, use, in, several, fields, before, being, applied, to, computers, the, remains, of, the, moth, can, be, found, taped, into, the, group, s, log, book, at, the, smithsonian, institution, s, national, museum, of, american, history, in, washington, d, c, hopper, became, known, for, her, nanoseconds, visual, aid, people, such, as, generals, and, admirals, used, to, ask, her, why, satellite, communication, took, so, long, she, started, handing, out, pieces, of, wire, that, were, just, under, one, foot, long, 11, 8, inches, 30, cm, the, distance, that, light, travels, in, one, nanosecond, she, gave, these, pieces, of, wire, the, metonym, nanoseconds, she, was, careful, to, tell, her, audience, that, the, length, of, her, nanoseconds, was, actually, the, maximum, distance, the, signals, would, travel, in, a, vacuum, and, that, signals, would, travel, more, slowly, through, the, actual, wires, that, were, her, teaching, aids, later, she, used, the, same, pieces, of, wire, to, illustrate, why, computers, had, to, be, small, to, be, fast, at, many, of, her, talks, and, visits, she, handed, out, nanoseconds, to, everyone, in, the, audience, contrasting, them, with, a, coil, of, wire, 984, feet, 300, meters, long, representing, a, microsecond, later, while, giving, these, lectures, while, working, for, dec, she, passed, out, packets, of, pepper, calling, the, individual, grains, of, ground, pepper, picoseconds, jay, elliot, described, hopper, as, appearing, to, be, all, navy, but, when, you, reach, inside, you, find, a, pirate, dying, to, be, released, on, new, year, s, day, 1992, hopper, died, in, her, sleep, of, natural, causes, at, her, home, in, arlington, county, virginia, she, was, 85, years, of, age, she, was, interred, with, full, military, honors, in, arlington, national, cemetery, her, legacy, was, an, inspiring, factor, in, the, creation, of, the, grace, hopper, celebration, of, women, in, computing, held, yearly, this, conference, is, designed, to, bring, the, research, and, career, interests, of, women, in, computing, to, the, forefront
