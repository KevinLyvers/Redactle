brothers, to, give, the, elephant, and, the, necklace, to, him, which, both, his, brothers, denied, saying, that, these, gifts, were, given, by, their, dear, father, so, why, should, they, part, from, them, ajatashatru, sent, the, request, thrice, but, got, the, same, reply, all, three, times, this, greatly, annoyed, him, so, he, sent, his, men, to, arrest, them, meanwhile, halla, and, the,

his, own, share, and, most, of, diamonds, were, carried, away, by, the, lichhavis, over, time, finally, ajatashatru, became, annoyed, and, decided, to, do, something, about, it, since, he, thought, that, it, might, be, almost, impossible, to, fight, against, the, whole, confederacy, of, vaishali, he, decided, instead, to, uproot, the, powerful, vajjis, and, exterminate, them, he, sent, his, chief, minister, vassakara, to, the, buddha, to, ask, him, why, the, vaishali, should, be, so, invincible, to, which, buddha, gave, seven, reasons, including, that, the, vajjis, are, always, punctual, to, meetings, their, disciplined, behavior, their, respect, for, elders, respect, for, women, that, they, do, not, marry, their, daughters, forcefully, that, they, give, spiritual, protection, to, the, arhats, and, finally, the, main, reason, was, the, chaityas, altar, which, was, inside, the, town, thus, with, the, help, of, his, chief, minister, vassakara, ajatashatru, managed, to, split, the, vajjis, and, also, broke, the, chaityas, inside, during, this, battle, ajatashatru, used, a, scythed, chariot, featuring, a, swinging, mace, and, blades, on, both, sides, and, attacked, the,
