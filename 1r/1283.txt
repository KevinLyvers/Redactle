william, pitt, 28, may, 1759, 23, january, 1806, was, a, british, statesman, the, youngest, and, last, prime, minister, of, great, britain, from, 1783, until, the, acts, of, union, 1800, and, then, first, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, from, january, 1801, he, left, office, in, march, 1801, but, served, as, prime, minister, again, from, 1804, until, his, death, in, 1806, he, was, also, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, for, all, of, his, time, as, prime, minister, he, is, known, as, pitt, the, younger, to, distinguish, him, from, his, father, william, pitt, the, elder, who, had, also, previously, served, as, prime, minister, pitt, s, prime, ministerial, tenure, which, came, during, the, reign, of, king, george, iii, was, dominated, by, major, political, events, in, europe, including, the, french, revolution, and, the, napoleonic, wars, pitt, although, often, referred, to, as, a, tory, or, new, tory, called, himself, an, independent, whig, and, was, generally, opposed, to, the, development, of, a, strict, partisan, political, system, pitt, was, regarded, as, an, outstanding, administrator, who, worked, for, efficiency, and, reform, bringing, in, a, new, generation, of, competent, administrators, he, increased, taxes, to, pay, for, the, great, war, against, france, and, cracked, down, on, radicalism, to, counter, the, threat, of, irish, support, for, france, he, engineered, the, acts, of, union, 1800, and, tried, but, failed, to, secure, catholic, emancipation, as, part, of, the, union, he, created, the, new, toryism, which, revived, the, tory, party, and, enabled, it, to, stay, in, power, for, the, next, quarter, century, the, historian, asa, briggs, argues, that, his, personality, did, not, endear, itself, to, the, british, mind, for, pitt, was, too, solitary, and, too, colourless, and, too, often, exuded, an, attitude, of, superiority, his, greatness, came, in, the, war, with, france, pitt, reacted, to, become, what, lord, minto, called, the, atlas, of, our, reeling, globe, william, wilberforce, said, for, personal, purity, disinterestedness, and, love, of, this, country, i, have, never, known, his, equal, historian, charles, petrie, concludes, that, he, was, one, of, the, greatest, prime, ministers, if, on, no, other, ground, than, that, he, enabled, the, country, to, pass, from, the, old, order, to, the, new, without, any, violent, upheaval, he, understood, the, new, britain, for, this, he, is, ranked, highly, amongst, all, british, prime, ministers, in, multiple, surveys, pitt, served, as, prime, minister, for, a, total, of, eighteen, years, 343, days, making, him, the, second, longest, serving, british, prime, minister, of, all, time, after, robert, walpole, william, pitt, the, second, son, of, william, pitt, 1st, earl, of, chatham, was, born, on, 28, may, 1759, at, hayes, place, in, the, village, of, hayes, kent, he, was, from, a, political, family, on, both, sides, as, his, mother, hester, grenville, was, sister, of, former, prime, minister, george, grenville, according, to, biographer, john, ehrman, pitt, exhibited, the, brilliance, and, dynamism, of, his, father, s, line, and, the, determined, methodical, nature, of, the, grenvilles, suffering, from, occasional, poor, health, as, a, boy, he, was, educated, at, home, by, the, reverend, edward, wilson, an, intelligent, child, pitt, quickly, became, proficient, in, latin, and, greek, he, was, admitted, to, pembroke, college, cambridge, on, 26, april, 1773, a, month, before, turning, fourteen, going, up, to, cambridge, in, october, 1773, he, studied, political, philosophy, classics, mathematics, trigonometry, chemistry, and, history, at, cambridge, pitt, was, tutored, by, george, pretyman, who, became, a, close, personal, friend, pitt, later, appointed, pretyman, bishop, of, lincoln, then, winchester, and, drew, upon, his, advice, throughout, his, political, career, while, at, cambridge, he, befriended, the, young, william, wilberforce, who, became, a, lifelong, friend, and, political, ally, in, parliament, pitt, tended, to, socialise, only, with, fellow, students, and, others, already, known, to, him, rarely, venturing, outside, the, university, grounds, yet, he, was, described, as, charming, and, friendly, according, to, wilberforce, pitt, had, an, exceptional, wit, along, with, an, endearingly, gentle, sense, of, humour, no, man, ever, indulged, more, freely, or, happily, in, that, playful, facetiousness, which, gratifies, all, without, wounding, any, in, 1776, pitt, plagued, by, poor, health, took, advantage, of, a, little, used, privilege, available, only, to, the, sons, of, noblemen, and, chose, to, graduate, without, having, to, pass, examinations, pitt, s, father, was, said, to, have, insisted, that, his, son, spontaneously, translate, passages, of, classical, literature, orally, into, english, and, declaim, impromptu, upon, unfamiliar, topics, in, an, effort, to, develop, his, oratorical, skills, pitt, s, father, who, had, by, then, been, raised, to, the, peerage, as, earl, of, chatham, died, in, 1778, as, the, younger, son, pitt, received, only, a, small, inheritance, he, acquired, his, legal, education, at, lincoln, s, inn, and, was, called, to, the, bar, in, the, summer, of, 1780, during, the, general, elections, of, september, 1780, at, the, age, of, 21, pitt, contested, the, university, of, cambridge, seat, but, lost, still, intent, on, entering, parliament, pitt, secured, the, patronage, of, james, lowther, later, 1st, earl, lowther, with, the, help, of, his, university, friend, charles, manners, 4th, duke, of, rutland, lowther, effectively, controlled, the, pocket, borough, of, appleby, a, by, election, in, that, constituency, sent, pitt, to, the, house, of, commons, in, january, 1781, pitt, s, entry, into, parliament, is, somewhat, ironic, as, he, later, railed, against, the, very, same, pocket, and, rotten, boroughs, that, had, given, him, his, seat, in, parliament, the, youthful, pitt, cast, aside, his, tendency, to, be, withdrawn, in, public, emerging, as, a, noted, debater, right, from, his, maiden, speech, pitt, originally, aligned, himself, with, prominent, whigs, such, as, charles, james, fox, with, the, whigs, pitt, denounced, the, continuation, of, the, american, war, of, independence, as, his, father, strongly, had, instead, he, proposed, that, the, prime, minister, lord, north, make, peace, with, the, rebellious, american, colonies, pitt, also, supported, parliamentary, reform, measures, including, a, proposal, that, would, have, checked, electoral, corruption, he, renewed, his, friendship, with, william, wilberforce, now, mp, for, hull, with, whom, he, frequently, met, in, the, gallery, of, the, house, of, commons, after, lord, north, s, ministry, collapsed, in, 1782, the, whig, charles, watson, wentworth, 2nd, marquess, of, rockingham, was, appointed, prime, minister, pitt, was, offered, the, minor, post, of, vice, treasurer, of, ireland, but, he, refused, considering, the, post, overly, subordinate, lord, rockingham, died, only, three, months, after, coming, to, power, he, was, succeeded, by, another, whig, william, petty, 2nd, earl, of, shelburne, many, whigs, who, had, formed, a, part, of, the, rockingham, ministry, including, fox, now, refused, to, serve, under, lord, shelburne, the, new, prime, minister, pitt, however, was, comfortable, with, shelburne, and, thus, joined, his, government, he, was, appointed, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, fox, who, became, pitt, s, lifelong, political, rival, then, joined, a, coalition, with, lord, north, with, whom, he, collaborated, to, bring, about, the, defeat, of, the, shelburne, administration, when, lord, shelburne, resigned, in, 1783, king, george, iii, who, despised, fox, offered, to, appoint, pitt, to, the, office, of, prime, minister, but, pitt, wisely, declined, for, he, knew, he, would, be, incapable, of, securing, the, support, of, the, house, of, commons, the, fox, north, coalition, rose, to, power, in, a, government, nominally, headed, by, william, cavendish, bentinck, 3rd, duke, of, portland, pitt, who, had, been, stripped, of, his, post, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, joined, the, opposition, he, raised, the, issue, of, parliamentary, reform, in, order, to, strain, the, uneasy, fox, north, coalition, which, included, both, supporters, and, detractors, of, reform, he, did, not, advocate, an, expansion, of, the, electoral, franchise, but, he, did, seek, to, address, bribery, and, rotten, boroughs, though, his, proposal, failed, many, reformers, in, parliament, came, to, regard, him, as, their, leader, instead, of, charles, james, fox, losing, the, war, and, the, thirteen, colonies, was, a, shock, to, the, british, system, the, war, revealed, the, limitations, of, britain, s, fiscal, military, state, when, it, had, powerful, enemies, and, no, allies, depended, on, extended, and, vulnerable, transatlantic, lines, of, communication, and, was, faced, for, the, first, time, since, the, 17th, century, by, both, protestant, and, catholic, foes, the, defeat, heightened, dissension, and, escalated, political, antagonism, to, the, king, s, ministers, inside, parliament, the, primary, concern, changed, from, fears, of, an, over, mighty, monarch, to, the, issues, of, representation, parliamentary, reform, and, government, retrenchment, reformers, sought, to, destroy, what, they, saw, as, widespread, institutional, corruption, the, result, was, a, crisis, from, 1776, to, 1783, the, peace, in, 1783, left, france, financially, prostrate, while, the, british, economy, boomed, due, to, the, return, of, american, business, that, crisis, ended, in, 1784, as, a, result, of, the, king, s, shrewdness, in, outwitting, fox, and, renewed, confidence, in, the, system, engendered, by, the, leadership, of, pitt, historians, conclude, that, the, loss, of, the, american, colonies, enabled, britain, to, deal, with, the, french, revolution, with, more, unity, and, organisation, than, would, otherwise, have, been, the, case, britain, turned, towards, asia, the, pacific, and, later, africa, with, subsequent, exploration, leading, to, the, rise, of, the, second, british, empire, the, fox, north, coalition, fell, in, december, 1783, after, fox, had, introduced, edmund, burke, s, bill, to, reform, the, east, india, company, to, gain, the, patronage, he, so, greatly, lacked, while, the, king, refused, to, support, him, fox, stated, the, bill, was, necessary, to, save, the, company, from, bankruptcy, pitt, responded, that, necessity, is, the, plea, for, every, infringement, of, human, freedom, it, is, the, argument, of, tyrants, it, is, the, creed, of, slaves, the, king, was, opposed, to, the, bill, when, it, passed, in, the, house, of, commons, he, secured, its, defeat, in, the, house, of, lords, by, threatening, to, regard, anyone, who, voted, for, it, as, his, enemy, following, the, bill, s, failure, in, the, upper, house, george, iii, dismissed, the, coalition, government, and, finally, entrusted, the, premiership, to, william, pitt, after, having, offered, the, position, to, him, three, times, previously, a, constitutional, crisis, arose, when, the, king, dismissed, the, fox, north, coalition, government, and, named, pitt, to, replace, it, though, faced, with, a, hostile, majority, in, parliament, pitt, was, able, to, solidify, his, position, within, a, few, months, some, historians, argue, that, his, success, was, inevitable, given, the, decisive, importance, of, monarchical, power, others, argue, that, the, king, gambled, on, pitt, and, that, both, would, have, failed, but, for, a, run, of, good, fortune, pitt, at, the, age, of, 24, became, great, britain, s, youngest, prime, minister, ever, the, contemporary, satire, the, rolliad, ridiculed, him, for, his, youth, above, the, rest, majestically, great, behold, the, infant, atlas, of, the, state, the, matchless, miracle, of, modern, days, in, whom, britannia, to, the, world, displays, a, sight, to, make, surrounding, nations, stare, a, kingdom, trusted, to, a, school, boy, s, care, many, saw, pitt, as, a, stop, gap, appointment, until, some, more, senior, statesman, took, on, the, role, however, although, it, was, widely, predicted, that, the, new, mince, pie, administration, would, not, outlast, the, christmas, season, it, survived, for, seventeen, years, so, as, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, opposition, pitt, offered, charles, james, fox, and, his, allies, posts, in, the, cabinet, pitt, s, refusal, to, include, lord, north, however, thwarted, his, efforts, the, new, government, was, immediately, on, the, defensive, and, in, january, 1784, was, defeated, on, a, motion, of, no, confidence, pitt, however, took, the, unprecedented, step, of, refusing, to, resign, despite, this, defeat, he, retained, the, support, of, the, king, who, would, not, entrust, the, reins, of, power, to, the, fox, north, coalition, he, also, received, the, support, of, the, house, of, lords, which, passed, supportive, motions, and, many, messages, of, support, from, the, country, at, large, in, the, form, of, petitions, approving, of, his, appointment, which, influenced, some, members, to, switch, their, support, to, pitt, at, the, same, time, he, was, granted, the, freedom, of, the, city, of, london, when, he, returned, from, the, ceremony, to, mark, this, men, of, the, city, pulled, pitt, s, coach, home, themselves, as, a, sign, of, respect, when, passing, a, whig, club, the, coach, came, under, attack, from, a, group, of, men, who, tried, to, assault, pitt, when, news, of, this, spread, it, was, assumed, fox, and, his, associates, had, tried, to, bring, down, pitt, by, any, means, pitt, gained, great, popularity, with, the, public, at, large, as, honest, billy, who, was, seen, as, a, refreshing, change, from, the, dishonesty, corruption, and, lack, of, principles, widely, associated, with, both, fox, and, north, despite, a, series, of, defeats, in, the, house, of, commons, pitt, defiantly, remained, in, office, watching, the, coalition, s, majority, shrink, as, some, members, of, parliament, left, the, opposition, to, abstain, in, march, 1784, parliament, was, dissolved, and, a, general, election, ensued, an, electoral, defeat, for, the, government, was, out, of, the, question, because, pitt, enjoyed, the, support, of, king, george, iii, patronage, and, bribes, paid, by, the, treasury, were, normally, expected, to, be, enough, to, secure, the, government, a, comfortable, majority, in, the, house, of, commons, but, on, this, occasion, the, government, reaped, much, popular, support, as, well, in, most, popular, constituencies, the, election, was, fought, between, candidates, clearly, representing, either, pitt, or, fox, and, north, early, returns, showed, a, massive, swing, to, pitt, with, the, result, that, many, opposition, members, who, still, had, not, faced, election, either, defected, stood, down, or, made, deals, with, their, opponents, to, avoid, expensive, defeats, a, notable, exception, came, in, fox, s, own, constituency, of, westminster, which, contained, one, of, the, largest, electorates, in, the, country, in, a, contest, estimated, to, have, cost, a, quarter, of, the, total, spending, in, the, entire, country, fox, bitterly, fought, against, two, pittite, candidates, to, secure, one, of, the, two, seats, for, the, constituency, great, legal, wranglings, ensued, including, the, examination, of, every, single, vote, cast, which, dragged, on, for, more, than, a, year, meanwhile, fox, sat, for, the, scottish, pocket, borough, of, tain, burghs, many, saw, the, dragging, out, of, the, result, as, being, unduly, vindictive, on, the, part, of, pitt, and, eventually, the, examinations, were, abandoned, with, fox, declared, elected, elsewhere, pitt, won, a, personal, triumph, when, he, was, elected, a, member, for, the, university, of, cambridge, a, constituency, he, had, long, coveted, and, which, he, would, continue, to, represent, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, in, domestic, politics, pitt, concerned, himself, with, the, cause, of, parliamentary, reform, in, 1785, he, introduced, a, bill, to, remove, the, representation, of, thirty, six, rotten, boroughs, and, to, extend, in, a, small, way, the, electoral, franchise, to, more, individuals, pitt, s, support, for, the, bill, however, was, not, strong, enough, to, prevent, its, defeat, in, the, house, of, commons, the, bill, of, 1785, was, the, last, parliamentary, reform, proposal, introduced, by, pitt, to, british, legislators, his, administration, secure, pitt, could, begin, to, enact, his, agenda, his, first, major, piece, of, legislation, as, prime, minister, was, the, india, act, 1784, which, re, organised, the, british, east, india, company, and, kept, a, watch, over, corruption, the, india, act, created, a, new, board, of, control, to, oversee, the, affairs, of, the, east, india, company, it, differed, from, fox, s, failed, india, bill, 1783, and, specified, that, the, board, would, be, appointed, by, the, king, pitt, was, appointed, along, with, lord, sydney, who, was, appointed, president, the, act, centralised, british, rule, in, india, by, reducing, the, power, of, the, governors, of, bombay, and, madras, and, by, increasing, that, of, governor, general, charles, cornwallis, further, augmentations, and, clarifications, of, the, governor, general, s, authority, were, made, in, 1786, presumably, by, lord, sydney, and, presumably, as, a, result, of, the, company, s, setting, up, of, penang, with, their, own, superintendent, governor, captain, francis, light, in, 1786, convicts, were, originally, transported, to, the, thirteen, colonies, in, north, america, but, after, the, american, war, of, independence, ended, in, 1783, the, newly, formed, united, states, refused, to, accept, further, convicts, pitt, s, government, took, the, decision, to, settle, what, is, now, australia, and, found, the, penal, colony, in, august, 1786, the, first, fleet, of, 11, vessels, carried, over, a, thousand, settlers, including, 778, convicts, the, colony, of, new, south, wales, was, formally, proclaimed, by, governor, arthur, phillip, on, 7, february, 1788, at, sydney, another, important, domestic, issue, with, which, pitt, had, to, concern, himself, was, the, national, debt, which, had, doubled, to, 243, million, during, the, american, war, every, year, a, third, of, the, budget, of, 24, million, went, to, pay, interest, pitt, sought, to, reduce, the, national, debt, by, imposing, new, taxes, in, 1786, he, instituted, a, sinking, fund, so, that, 1, million, a, year, was, added, to, a, fund, so, that, it, could, accumulate, interest, eventually, the, money, in, the, fund, was, to, be, used, to, pay, off, the, national, debt, by, 1792, the, debt, had, fallen, to, 170, million, pitt, always, paid, careful, attention, to, financial, issues, a, fifth, of, britain, s, imports, were, smuggled, in, without, paying, taxes, he, made, it, easier, for, honest, merchants, to, import, goods, by, lowering, tariffs, on, easily, smuggled, items, such, as, tea, wine, spirits, and, tobacco, this, policy, raised, customs, revenues, by, nearly, 2, million, a, year, in, 1797, pitt, was, forced, to, protect, the, kingdom, s, gold, reserves, by, preventing, individuals, from, exchanging, banknotes, for, gold, great, britain, would, continue, to, use, paper, money, for, over, two, decades, pitt, also, introduced, great, britain, s, first, ever, income, tax, the, new, tax, helped, offset, losses, in, indirect, tax, revenue, which, had, been, caused, by, a, decline, in, trade, pitt, sought, european, alliances, to, restrict, french, influence, forming, the, triple, alliance, with, prussia, and, holland, in, 1788, during, the, nootka, sound, controversy, in, 1790, pitt, took, advantage, of, the, alliance, to, force, spain, to, give, up, its, claim, to, exclusive, control, over, the, western, coast, of, north, and, south, america, the, alliance, however, failed, to, produce, any, other, important, benefits, for, great, britain, pitt, was, alarmed, at, russian, expansion, in, the, 1780s, at, the, expense, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, relations, between, russia, and, britain, were, disturbed, during, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1787, 1792, by, pitt, s, subscription, to, the, view, of, the, prussian, government, that, the, triple, alliance, could, not, with, impunity, allow, the, balance, of, power, in, eastern, europe, to, be, disturbed, in, peace, talks, with, the, ottomans, russia, refused, to, return, the, key, ochakov, fortress, pitt, wanted, to, threaten, military, retaliation, however, russia, s, ambassador, semyon, vorontsov, organised, pitt, s, enemies, and, launched, a, public, opinion, campaign, pitt, had, become, alarmed, at, the, opposition, to, his, russian, policy, in, parliament, burke, and, fox, both, uttering, powerful, speeches, against, the, restoration, of, ochakov, to, the, turks, pitt, won, the, vote, so, narrowly, that, he, gave, up, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, and, its, attendant, wars, temporarily, united, britain, and, russia, in, an, ideological, alliance, against, french, republicanism, in, 1788, pitt, faced, a, major, crisis, when, the, king, fell, victim, to, a, mysterious, illness, a, form, of, mental, disorder, that, incapacitated, him, if, the, sovereign, was, incapable, of, fulfilling, his, constitutional, duties, parliament, would, need, to, appoint, a, regent, to, rule, in, his, place, all, factions, agreed, that, the, only, viable, candidate, was, the, king, s, eldest, son, and, heir, apparent, george, prince, of, wales, the, prince, however, was, a, supporter, of, charles, james, fox, had, the, prince, come, to, power, he, would, almost, surely, have, dismissed, pitt, he, did, not, have, such, an, opportunity, however, as, parliament, spent, months, debating, legal, technicalities, relating, to, the, regency, fortunately, for, pitt, the, king, recovered, in, february, 1789, just, after, a, regency, bill, had, been, introduced, and, passed, in, the, house, of, commons, the, general, elections, of, 1790, resulted, in, a, majority, for, the, government, and, pitt, continued, as, prime, minister, in, 1791, he, proceeded, to, address, one, of, the, problems, facing, the, growing, british, empire, the, future, of, british, canada, by, the, constitutional, act, of, 1791, the, province, of, quebec, was, divided, into, two, separate, provinces, the, predominantly, french, lower, canada, and, the, predominantly, english, upper, canada, in, august, 1792, coincident, with, the, capture, of, louis, xvi, by, the, french, revolutionaries, george, iii, appointed, pitt, as, lord, warden, of, the, cinque, ports, a, position, whose, incumbent, was, responsible, for, the, coastal, defences, of, the, realm, the, king, had, in, 1791, offered, him, a, knighthood, of, the, garter, but, he, suggested, the, honour, go, to, his, elder, brother, the, second, earl, of, chatham, an, early, favourable, response, to, the, french, revolution, encouraged, many, in, great, britain, to, reopen, the, issue, of, parliamentary, reform, which, had, been, dormant, since, pitt, s, reform, bill, was, defeated, in, 1785, the, reformers, however, were, quickly, labelled, as, radicals, and, associates, of, the, french, revolutionaries, subsequently, in, 1794, pitt, s, administration, tried, three, of, them, for, treason, but, lost, parliament, began, to, enact, repressive, legislation, in, order, to, silence, the, reformers, individuals, who, published, seditious, material, were, punished, and, in, 1794, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, was, suspended, other, repressive, measures, included, the, seditious, meetings, act, 1795, which, restricted, the, right, of, individuals, to, assemble, publicly, and, the, combination, acts, which, restricted, the, formation, of, societies, or, organisations, that, favoured, political, reforms, problems, manning, the, royal, navy, also, led, to, pitt, to, introduce, the, quota, system, in, 1795, in, addition, to, the, existing, system, of, impressment, the, war, with, france, was, extremely, expensive, straining, great, britain, s, finances, unlike, in, the, latter, stages, of, the, napoleonic, wars, at, this, point, britain, had, only, a, very, small, standing, army, and, thus, contributed, to, the, war, effort, mainly, through, sea, power, and, by, supplying, funds, to, other, coalition, members, facing, france, throughout, the, 1790s, the, war, against, france, was, presented, as, an, ideological, struggle, between, french, republicanism, vs, british, monarchism, with, the, british, government, seeking, to, mobilise, public, opinion, in, support, of, the, war, the, pitt, government, waged, a, vigorous, propaganda, campaign, contrasting, the, ordered, society, of, britain, dominated, by, the, aristocracy, and, the, gentry, vs, the, anarchy, of, the, french, revolution, and, always, sought, to, associate, british, radicals, with, the, revolution, in, france, though, the, pitt, government, did, drastically, reduce, civil, liberties, and, created, a, nationwide, spy, network, with, ordinary, people, being, encouraged, to, denounce, any, radicals, that, might, be, in, their, midst, the, historian, eric, j, evans, argued, the, picture, of, pitt, s, reign, of, terror, as, portrayed, by, the, marxist, historian, e, p, thompson, is, incorrect, stating, there, is, much, evidence, of, a, popular, conservative, movement, that, rallied, in, defence, of, king, and, country, evans, wrote, that, there, were, about, 200, prosecutions, of, radicals, suspected, of, sympathy, with, the, french, revolution, in, british, courts, in, the, 1790s, which, was, much, less, than, the, prosecutions, of, suspected, jacobites, after, the, rebellions, of, 1715, and, 1745, however, the, spy, network, maintained, by, the, government, was, efficient, in, jane, austen, s, novel, northanger, abbey, which, was, written, in, the, 1790s, but, not, published, until, 1817, one, of, the, characters, remarks, that, it, is, not, possible, for, a, family, to, keep, secrets, in, these, modern, times, when, spies, for, the, government, were, lurking, everywhere, this, comment, captures, well, the, tense, paranoid, atmosphere, of, the, 1790s, when, people, were, being, encouraged, to, report, radicals, to, the, authorities, in, 1793, pitt, decided, to, take, advantage, of, the, haitian, revolution, to, seize, st, domingue, the, richest, french, colony, in, the, world, believing, this, would, strike, a, great, blow, at, france, while, bringing, st, domingue, into, the, british, empire, and, ensuring, that, the, slaves, in, the, british, west, indies, would, not, be, inspired, to, revolt, likewise, many, of, those, who, owned, slave, plantations, in, the, british, west, indies, had, been, greatly, alarmed, by, the, revolution, which, began, in, 1791, and, they, were, strongly, pressing, pitt, to, restore, slavery, in, st, domingue, lest, their, own, slaves, be, inspired, to, seek, freedom, henry, dundas, 1st, viscount, melville, who, was, pitt, s, secretary, of, state, for, war, instructed, sir, adam, williamson, the, lieutenant, governor, of, jamaica, to, sign, an, agreement, with, representatives, of, the, french, colonists, that, promised, to, restore, the, ancien, regime, slavery, and, discrimination, against, mixed, race, colonists, a, move, that, drew, criticism, from, abolitionists, william, wilberforce, and, thomas, clarkson, the, british, landed, in, st, domingue, on, 20, september, 1793, stating, they, had, come, to, protect, the, white, population, from, the, blacks, and, were, able, to, seize, some, coastal, enclaves, the, fact, that, the, british, had, come, to, restore, slavery, in, st, domingue, inspired, ferocious, resistance, from, the, haitians, who, had, no, desire, to, be, forced, into, chains, again, the, heavy, death, toll, caused, by, yellow, fever, the, much, dreaded, black, vomit, made, conquering, st, domingue, impossible, but, an, undeterred, pitt, launched, what, he, called, the, great, push, in, 1795, sending, out, an, even, larger, british, expedition, in, november, 1795, some, 218, ships, left, portsmouth, for, st, domingue, after, the, failure, of, the, quiberon, expedition, earlier, in, 1795, when, the, british, landed, a, force, of, french, royalists, on, the, coast, of, france, who, were, annihilated, by, the, forces, of, the, republic, pitt, had, decided, it, was, crucial, for, britain, to, have, st, domingue, no, matter, what, the, cost, in, lives, and, money, to, improve, britain, s, negotiating, hand, when, it, came, time, to, make, peace, with, the, french, republic, the, british, historian, michael, duffy, argued, that, since, pitt, committed, far, more, manpower, and, money, to, the, caribbean, expeditions, especially, the, one, to, st, domingue, than, he, ever, did, to, europe, in, the, years, 1793, 1798, it, is, proper, to, view, the, west, indies, as, britain, s, main, theatre, of, war, and, europe, as, more, of, a, sideshow, by, 1795, 50, of, the, british, army, was, deployed, in, the, west, indies, with, the, largest, contingent, in, st, domingue, whereas, the, rest, of, the, british, army, was, divided, among, britain, europe, india, and, north, america, as, the, british, death, toll, largely, caused, by, yellow, fever, continued, to, climb, pitt, was, criticised, in, the, house, of, commons, several, mps, suggested, it, might, be, better, to, abandon, the, expedition, but, pitt, insisted, that, britain, had, given, its, word, of, honour, that, it, would, protect, the, french, planters, from, their, former, slaves, and, the, expedition, to, st, domingue, could, not, be, abandoned, the, british, attempt, to, conquer, st, domingue, in, 1793, ended, in, disaster, the, british, pulled, out, on, 31, august, 1798, after, having, spent, 4, million, pounds, roughly, 500, million, in, 2023, and, having, lost, about, 100, 000, men, dead, or, crippled, for, life, mostly, from, disease, over, the, preceding, five, years, the, british, historian, sir, john, william, fortescue, wrote, that, pitt, and, his, cabinet, had, tried, to, destroy, french, power, in, these, pestilent, islands, only, to, discover, when, it, was, too, late, that, they, practically, destroyed, the, british, army, fortescue, concluded, that, pitt, s, attempt, to, add, st, domingue, to, the, british, empire, had, killed, off, most, of, the, british, army, cost, the, british, treasury, a, fortune, and, weakened, british, influence, in, europe, making, british, power, fettered, numbered, and, paralysed, all, for, nothing, in, may, 1798, the, long, simmering, unrest, in, ireland, exploded, into, outright, rebellion, with, the, united, irishmen, society, launching, a, revolt, to, win, independence, for, ireland, pitt, took, an, extremely, repressive, approach, to, the, united, irishmen, with, the, crown, executing, about, 1, 500, united, irishmen, after, the, revolt, the, revolt, of, 1798, destroyed, pitt, s, faith, in, the, governing, competence, of, the, dublin, parliament, dominated, by, protestant, ascendancy, families, thinking, a, less, sectarian, and, more, conciliatory, approach, would, have, avoided, the, uprising, pitt, sought, an, act, of, union, that, would, make, ireland, an, official, part, of, the, united, kingdom, and, end, the, irish, question, the, french, expeditions, to, ireland, in, 1796, and, 1798, to, support, the, united, irishmen, were, regarded, by, pitt, as, near, misses, that, might, have, provided, an, irish, base, for, french, attacks, on, britain, thus, making, the, irish, question, a, national, security, matter, as, the, dublin, parliament, did, not, wish, to, disband, pitt, made, generous, use, of, what, would, now, be, called, pork, barrel, politics, to, bribe, irish, mps, to, vote, for, the, act, of, union, throughout, the, 1790s, the, popularity, of, the, society, of, united, irishmen, grew, influenced, by, the, american, and, french, revolutions, this, movement, demanded, independence, and, republicanism, for, ireland, the, united, irishmen, society, was, very, anti, clerical, being, equally, opposed, to, the, superstitions, promoted, by, both, the, church, of, england, and, the, roman, catholic, church, which, caused, the, latter, to, support, the, crown, realising, that, the, catholic, church, was, an, ally, in, the, struggle, against, the, french, revolution, pitt, had, tried, fruitlessly, to, persuade, the, dublin, parliament, to, loosen, the, anti, catholic, laws, to, keep, things, quiet, in, ireland, pitt, s, efforts, to, soften, the, anti, catholic, laws, failed, in, the, face, of, determined, resistance, from, the, families, of, the, protestant, ascendancy, in, ireland, who, forced, pitt, to, recall, earl, fitzwilliam, as, chief, secretary, for, ireland, in, 1795, when, the, latter, had, indicated, he, would, support, a, bill, for, catholic, relief, in, much, of, rural, ireland, law, and, order, had, broken, down, as, an, economic, crisis, further, impoverished, the, already, poor, irish, peasantry, and, a, sectarian, war, with, many, atrocities, on, both, sides, had, begun, in, 1793, between, catholic, defenders, versus, protestant, peep, o, day, boys, a, section, of, the, peep, o, day, boys, who, had, renamed, themselves, the, loyal, orange, order, in, september, 1795, were, fanatically, committed, to, upholding, protestant, supremacy, in, ireland, at, almost, any, cost, in, december, 1796, a, french, invasion, of, ireland, led, by, general, lazare, hoche, scheduled, to, coordinate, with, a, rising, of, the, united, irishmen, was, only, thwarted, by, bad, weather, to, crush, the, united, irishmen, pitt, sent, general, lake, to, ulster, in, 1797, to, call, out, protestant, irish, militiamen, and, organised, an, intelligence, network, of, spies, and, informers, in, april, 1797, the, mutiny, of, the, entire, spithead, fleet, shook, the, government, sailors, demanded, a, pay, increase, to, match, inflation, this, mutiny, occurred, at, the, same, moment, that, the, franco, dutch, alliance, were, preparing, an, invasion, of, britain, to, regain, control, of, the, fleet, pitt, agreed, to, navy, pay, increases, and, had, george, iii, pardon, the, mutineers, by, contrast, the, more, political, floating, republic, naval, mutiny, at, the, nore, in, june, 1797, led, by, richard, parker, was, handled, more, repressively, pitt, refused, to, negotiate, with, parker, whom, he, wanted, to, see, hanged, as, a, mutineer, in, response, to, the, 1797, mutinies, pitt, passed, the, incitement, to, mutiny, act, 1797, making, it, unlawful, to, advocate, breaking, oaths, to, the, crown, in, 1798, he, passed, the, defence, of, the, realm, act, which, further, restricted, civil, liberties, despite, pitt, s, efforts, the, french, continued, to, defeat, the, first, coalition, which, collapsed, in, 1798, a, second, coalition, consisting, of, great, britain, austria, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, was, formed, but, it, too, failed, to, overcome, the, french, the, fall, of, the, second, coalition, with, the, defeat, of, the, austrians, at, the, battle, of, marengo, 14, june, 1800, and, at, the, battle, of, hohenlinden, 3, december, 1800, left, great, britain, facing, france, alone, following, the, acts, of, union, 1800, pitt, sought, to, inaugurate, the, new, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, by, granting, concessions, to, roman, catholics, who, formed, a, 75, majority, of, the, population, in, ireland, by, abolishing, various, political, restrictions, under, which, they, suffered, the, king, was, strongly, opposed, to, catholic, emancipation, he, argued, that, to, grant, additional, liberty, would, violate, his, coronation, oath, in, which, he, had, promised, to, protect, the, established, church, of, england, pitt, unable, to, change, the, king, s, strong, views, resigned, on, 16, february, 1801, so, as, to, allow, henry, addington, his, political, friend, to, form, a, new, administration, at, about, the, same, time, however, the, king, suffered, a, renewed, bout, of, madness, with, the, consequence, that, addington, could, not, receive, his, formal, appointment, though, he, had, resigned, pitt, temporarily, continued, to, discharge, his, duties, on, 18, february, 1801, he, brought, forward, the, annual, budget, power, was, transferred, from, pitt, to, addington, on, 14, march, when, the, king, recovered, shortly, after, leaving, office, pitt, supported, the, new, administration, under, addington, but, with, little, enthusiasm, he, frequently, absented, himself, from, parliament, preferring, to, remain, in, his, lord, warden, s, residence, of, walmer, castle, before, 1802, usually, spending, an, annual, late, summer, holiday, there, and, later, often, present, from, the, spring, until, the, autumn, from, the, castle, he, helped, organise, a, local, volunteer, corps, in, anticipation, of, a, french, invasion, acted, as, colonel, of, a, battalion, raised, by, trinity, house, he, was, also, a, master, of, trinity, house, and, encouraged, the, construction, of, martello, towers, and, the, royal, military, canal, in, romney, marsh, he, rented, land, abutting, the, castle, to, farm, on, which, to, lay, out, trees, and, walks, his, niece, lady, hester, stanhope, designed, and, managed, the, gardens, and, acted, as, his, hostess, the, treaty, of, amiens, in, 1802, between, france, and, britain, marked, the, end, of, the, french, revolutionary, wars, everyone, expected, it, to, be, only, a, short, truce, by, 1803, war, had, broken, out, again, with, france, under, napoleon, bonaparte, although, addington, had, previously, invited, him, to, join, the, cabinet, pitt, preferred, to, join, the, opposition, becoming, increasingly, critical, of, the, government, s, policies, addington, unable, to, face, the, combined, opposition, of, pitt, and, fox, saw, his, majority, gradually, evaporate, and, resigned, in, late, april, 1804, pitt, finally, returned, to, the, premiership, on, 10, may, 1804, he, had, originally, planned, to, form, a, broad, coalition, government, with, both, the, tories, and, whigs, under, one, government, but, pitt, faced, the, opposition, of, george, iii, to, the, inclusion, of, fox, due, to, the, king, s, dislike, moreover, many, of, pitt, s, former, supporters, including, the, allies, of, addington, joined, the, opposition, thus, pitt, s, second, ministry, was, considerably, weaker, than, his, first, nevertheless, pitt, formed, a, second, government, which, consisted, of, largely, tory, members, with, some, former, ministers, of, the, previous, ministry, these, include, lord, eldon, as, lord, chancellor, former, foreign, secretary, lord, hawkesbury, as, home, secretary, lord, harrowby, as, foreign, secretary, former, prime, ministers, duke, of, portland, and, addington, as, lord, privy, seal, and, lord, president, of, the, council, with, pitt, s, prominent, allies, the, viscount, melville, and, lord, castlereagh, as, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, and, secretary, of, state, for, the, colonies, respectively, by, the, time, pitt, became, prime, minister, in, 1804, the, war, in, europe, had, been, escalating, for, sometime, since, the, peace, of, amiens, in, 1801, and, in, 1803, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, began, pitt, s, new, government, resumed, the, war, effort, yet, again, to, confront, the, french, and, to, defeat, napoleon, pitt, had, initially, allied, britain, with, austria, prussia, and, russia, and, now, renewed, the, alliance, with, austria, prussia, and, russia, against, napoleonic, france, and, its, allies, the, british, government, began, placing, pressure, on, the, french, emperor, napoleon, i, by, imposing, sanctions, putting, up, a, blockade, across, the, english, channel, and, undermining, french, naval, activities, pitt, s, efforts, proved, a, success, and, thanks, to, his, efforts, the, united, kingdom, joined, the, third, coalition, an, alliance, that, included, austria, russia, and, sweden, in, october, 1805, the, british, admiral, horatio, nelson, 1st, viscount, nelson, won, a, crushing, victory, in, the, battle, of, trafalgar, ensuring, british, naval, supremacy, for, the, remainder, of, the, war, at, the, annual, lord, mayor, s, banquet, toasting, him, as, the, saviour, of, europe, pitt, responded, in, a, few, words, that, became, the, most, famous, speech, of, his, life, nevertheless, the, coalition, collapsed, having, suffered, significant, defeats, at, the, battle, of, ulm, october, 1805, and, the, battle, of, austerlitz, december, 1805, after, hearing, the, news, of, austerlitz, pitt, referred, to, a, map, of, europe, roll, up, that, map, it, will, not, be, wanted, these, ten, years, pitt, was, an, expert, in, finance, and, served, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, critical, to, his, success, in, confronting, napoleon, was, using, britain, s, superior, economic, resources, he, was, able, to, mobilise, the, nation, s, industrial, and, financial, resources, and, apply, them, to, defeating, france, with, a, population, of, 16, million, the, united, kingdom, was, barely, half, the, size, of, france, which, had, a, population, of, 30, million, in, terms, of, soldiers, however, the, french, numerical, advantage, was, offset, by, british, subsidies, that, paid, for, a, large, proportion, of, the, austrian, and, russian, soldiers, peaking, at, about, 450, 000, in, 1813, britain, used, its, economic, power, to, expand, the, royal, navy, doubling, the, number, of, frigates, and, increasing, the, number, of, the, larger, ships, of, the, line, by, 50, while, increasing, the, roster, of, sailors, from, 15, 000, to, 133, 000, in, eight, years, after, the, war, began, in, 1793, the, british, national, output, remained, strong, and, the, well, organised, business, sector, channelled, products, into, what, the, military, needed, france, meanwhile, saw, its, navy, shrink, by, more, than, half, the, system, of, smuggling, finished, products, into, the, continent, undermined, french, efforts, to, ruin, the, british, economy, by, cutting, off, markets, by, 1814, the, budget, that, pitt, in, his, last, years, had, largely, shaped, had, expanded, to, 66, million, including, 10, million, for, the, navy, 40, million, for, the, army, 10, million, for, the, allies, and, 38, million, as, interest, on, the, national, debt, the, national, debt, soared, to, 679, million, more, than, double, the, gdp, it, was, willingly, supported, by, hundreds, of, thousands, of, investors, and, tax, payers, despite, the, higher, taxes, on, land, and, a, new, income, tax, the, whole, cost, of, the, war, came, to, 831, million, the, french, financial, system, was, inadequate, and, napoleon, s, forces, had, to, rely, in, part, on, requisitions, from, conquered, lands, the, setbacks, took, a, toll, on, pitt, s, health, he, had, long, suffered, from, poor, health, beginning, in, childhood, and, was, plagued, with, gout, and, biliousness, which, was, worsened, by, a, fondness, for, port, that, began, when, he, was, advised, to, consume, it, to, deal, with, his, chronic, ill, health, on, 23, january, 1806, pitt, died, at, bowling, green, house, on, putney, heath, probably, from, peptic, ulceration, of, his, stomach, or, duodenum, he, was, unmarried, and, left, no, children, pitt, s, debts, amounted, to, 40, 000, equivalent, to, 4, 100, 000, in, 2023, when, he, died, but, parliament, agreed, to, pay, them, on, his, behalf, a, motion, was, made, to, honour, him, with, a, public, funeral, and, a, monument, it, passed, despite, some, opposition, pitt, s, body, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, on, 22, february, having, lain, in, state, for, two, days, in, the, palace, of, westminster, pitt, was, succeeded, as, prime, minister, by, his, first, cousin, william, grenville, 1st, baron, grenville, who, headed, the, ministry, of, all, the, talents, a, coalition, which, included, charles, james, fox, pitt, became, known, as, a, three, bottle, man, in, reference, to, his, heavy, consumption, of, port, wine, each, of, these, bottles, would, be, around, 350, millilitres, 12, us, fl, oz, in, volume, at, one, point, rumours, emerged, of, an, intended, marriage, to, eleanor, eden, to, whom, pitt, had, grown, close, pitt, broke, off, the, potential, marriage, in, 1797, writing, to, her, father, lord, auckland, i, am, compelled, to, say, that, i, find, the, obstacles, to, it, decisive, and, insurmountable, of, his, social, relationships, biographer, william, hague, writes, pitt, was, happiest, among, his, cambridge, companions, or, family, he, had, no, social, ambitions, and, it, was, rare, for, him, to, set, out, to, make, a, friend, the, talented, collaborators, of, his, first, 18, months, in, office, beresford, wyvil, and, twining, passed, in, and, out, of, his, mind, along, with, their, areas, of, expertise, pitt, s, lack, of, interest, in, enlarging, his, social, circle, meant, that, it, did, not, grow, to, encompass, any, women, outside, his, own, family, a, fact, that, produced, a, good, deal, of, rumour, from, late, 1784, a, series, of, satirical, verses, appeared, in, the, morning, herald, drawing, attention, to, pitt, s, lack, of, knowledge, of, women, tis, true, indeed, we, oft, abuse, him, because, he, bends, to, no, man, but, slander, s, self, dares, not, accuse, him, of, stiffness, to, a, woman, others, made, snide, references, to, pitt, s, friendship, with, tom, steele, secretary, to, the, treasury, at, the, height, of, the, constitutional, crisis, in, 1784, sheridan, had, compared, pitt, to, james, i, s, favourite, the, duke, of, buckingham, a, clear, reference, to, homosexuality, socially, pitt, preferred, the, company, of, young, men, and, would, continue, to, do, so, into, his, thirties, and, forties, it, may, be, that, pitt, had, homosexual, leanings, but, suppressed, any, urge, to, act, on, them, for, the, sake, of, his, ambitions, he, could, be, charming, to, women, but, it, seems, certain, that, he, rejected, intimacy, whenever, it, was, proffered, and, would, do, so, publicly, at, a, later, date, in, practical, terms, it, appears, that, pitt, was, essentially, asexual, throughout, his, life, william, pitt, the, younger, was, a, prime, minister, who, consolidated, the, powers, of, his, office, though, he, was, sometimes, opposed, by, members, of, his, cabinet, he, helped, define, the, role, of, the, prime, minister, as, the, supervisor, and, co, ordinator, of, the, various, government, departments, after, his, death, the, conservatives, embraced, him, as, a, great, patriotic, hero, one, of, pitt, s, accomplishments, was, a, rehabilitation, of, the, nation, s, finances, after, the, american, war, of, independence, pitt, made, changes, to, the, tax, system, in, order, to, improve, its, capture, of, revenue, which, helped, manage, the, mounting, national, debt, some, of, pitt, s, domestic, plans, were, not, successful, he, failed, to, secure, parliamentary, reform, emancipation, or, the, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, although, this, last, took, place, with, the, slave, trade, act, 1807, the, year, after, his, death, the, 1792, slave, trade, bill, passed, the, house, of, commons, mangled, and, mutilated, by, the, modifications, and, amendments, of, pitt, it, lay, for, years, in, the, house, of, lords, biographer, william, hague, considers, the, unfinished, abolition, of, the, slave, trade, to, be, pitt, s, greatest, failure, he, notes, that, by, the, end, of, pitt, s, career, conditions, were, in, place, that, would, have, allowed, a, skillful, attempt, to, pass, an, abolition, bill, to, succeed, partly, because, of, the, long, campaigning, pitt, had, encouraged, with, his, friend, william, wilberforce, hague, goes, on, to, note, that, the, failure, was, likely, due, to, pitt, being, a, spent, force, by, the, time, favourable, conditions, had, arisen, in, hague, s, opinion, pitt, s, long, premiership, tested, the, natural, limits, of, how, long, it, is, possible, to, be, at, the, top, from, 1783, to, 1792, he, faced, each, fresh, challenge, with, brilliance, from, 1793, he, showed, determination, but, sometimes, faltered, and, from, 1804, he, was, worn, down, by, the, combination, of, a, narrow, majority, and, war, historian, marie, peters, has, compared, his, strengths, and, weaknesses, with, his, father, william, pitt, is, depicted, in, several, films, and, television, programs, note, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, was, named, for, his, father, william, pitt, 1st, earl, of, chatham
