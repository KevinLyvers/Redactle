management, of, all, economic, production, the, process, did, not, go, smoothly, and, it, led, to, food, shortages, and, revolts, at, the, 10th, plenum, of, the, communist, party, 27, 29, october, 1956, gi, p, stood, in, front, of, the, assembled, delegates, and, said, cadres, in, carrying, out, their, antifeudal, task, created, contradictions, in, the, tasks, of, land, reform, and, the, revolution, in, some, areas, treating, them, as, if, they, were, separate, activities, we, indiscriminately, attacked, all, families, owning, land, many, thousands, were, executed, we, saw, enemies, everywhere, and, resorted, to, widespread, violence, and, terror, in, some, places, in, our, efforts, to, implement, land, reform, we, failed, to, respect, religious, freedoms, and, the, right, to, worship, we, placed, too, much, emphasis, on, class, origins, rather, than, political, attitudes, there, were, grave, errors, the, departure, of, the, french, and, the, partition, of, vietnam, meant, that, the, hanoi, government, only, controlled, the, north, part, of, the, country, in, south, vietnam, there, were, still, several, thousand, guerillas, known, as, viet, cong, fighting, against, the, government, in, saigon, the, party, plenum, in, 1957, ordered, changes, to, the, structure, of, their, units, and, gi, p, was, put, in, charge, of, implementing, them, and, building, their, strength, to, form, a, solid, basis, for, an, insurrection, in, the, south, the, 1959, plenum, decided, that, the, time, for, escalating, the, armed, struggle, in, the, south, was, right, and, in, july, that, year, gi, p, ordered, the, opening, up, of, the, ho, chi, minh, trail, to, improve, supply, lines, to, viet, cong, units, gi, p, remained, commander, in, chief, of, the, people, s, army, of, vietnam, throughout, the, war, against, south, vietnam, and, its, allies, the, united, states, australia, thailand, south, korea, and, the, philippines, he, oversaw, the, expansion, of, the, pavn, from, a, small, self, defense, force, into, a, large, conventional, army, equipped, by, its, communist, allies, with, considerable, amounts, of, relatively, sophisticated, weaponry, although, that, did, not, usually, match, the, weaponry, of, the, americans, gi, p, opposed, the, implementation, of, the, t, t, offensive, of, 1968, considering, focus, on, guerrilla, tactics, in, the, south, to, be, more, effective, the, best, evidence, suggests, that, when, it, became, obvious, that, l, du, n, and, v, n, ti, n, d, ng, were, going, to, conduct, it, anyway, he, left, vietnam, for, medical, treatment, in, hungary, and, did, not, return, until, after, the, offensive, had, begun, although, their, attempt, to, spark, a, general, uprising, against, the, southern, government, failed, disastrously, it, was, a, significant, political, victory, through, convincing, american, politicians, and, the, public, that, their, commitment, to, south, vietnam, could, not, be, open, ended, gi, p, later, argued, that, the, t, t, offensive, was, not, a, purely, military, strategy, but, part, of, a, general, strategy, an, integrated, one, at, once, military, political, and, diplomatic, peace, negotiations, between, representatives, from, the, united, states, south, vietnam, north, vietnam, and, the, viet, cong, began, in, paris, in, january, 1969, president, richard, nixon, like, president, lyndon, b, johnson, before, him, was, convinced, that, a, u, s, withdrawal, was, necessary, but, four, years, passed, before, the, last, american, troops, departed, in, october, 1972, the, negotiators, came, close, to, agreeing, to, a, formula, to, end, the, conflict, the, proposal, was, that, the, remaining, u, s, troops, would, withdraw, from, south, vietnam, in, exchange, for, a, cease, fire, and, the, return, of, american, prisoners, held, by, h, n, i, it, was, also, agreed, that, the, governments, in, north, and, south, vietnam, would, remain, in, power, and, reunification, would, be, carried, out, step, by, step, through, peaceful, means, although, the, north, s, nguy, n, hu, offensive, during, the, spring, of, 1972, was, beaten, back, with, high, casualties, the, proposal, did, not, require, them, to, leave, the, south, pavn, would, thus, be, able, to, maintain, a, foothold, in, south, vietnam, from, which, to, launch, future, offensives, in, an, effort, to, put, pressure, on, both, north, and, south, vietnam, during, the, negotiations, president, nixon, ordered, a, series, of, air, raids, on, hanoi, and, haiphong, codenamed, operation, linebacker, ii, the, operation, ended, on, 29, december, 1972, after, 12, days, with, 42, u, s, casualties, and, over, 1, 600, north, vietnamese, killed, north, vietnam, then, agreed, to, sign, the, paris, peace, accords, that, had, been, proposed, in, october, although, with, added, conditions, favorable, to, both, the, u, s, and, to, north, vietnam, south, vietnam, objected, but, had, little, choice, but, to, accept, it, the, last, u, s, combat, troops, had, left, in, august, 1972, the, remaining, u, s, military, personnel, except, for, the, staff, of, the, defense, attache, s, office, and, the, us, embassy, s, marine, guards, completed, their, withdrawal, in, march, 1973, despite, the, agreement, there, was, no, end, in, fighting, south, vietnamese, attempts, to, regain, communist, controlled, territory, inspired, their, opponents, to, change, strategy, communist, leaders, met, in, hanoi, in, march, for, a, series, of, meetings, to, plan, for, a, massive, offensive, against, the, south, in, june, 1973, the, u, s, congress, passed, the, case, church, amendment, which, prohibited, any, further, u, s, military, involvement, and, the, pavn, supply, routes, could, operate, normally, without, any, fear, of, u, s, bombing, the, standard, view, of, this, period, is, that, after, ho, chi, minh, s, death, in, september, 1969, gi, p, lost, a, power, struggle, in, 1972, shortly, after, the, failed, easter, offensive, where, he, was, blamed, by, the, politburo, for, the, offensive, s, failure, gi, p, was, recalled, to, hanoi, where, he, was, replaced, as, field, commander, of, the, pavn, and, from, then, on, watched, subsequent, events, from, the, sidelines, with, the, glory, of, victory, in, 1975, going, to, the, chief, of, the, general, staff, general, v, n, ti, n, d, ng, gi, p, s, contribution, to, the, 1975, victory, is, largely, ignored, by, official, vietnamese, accounts, soon, after, the, fall, of, saigon, the, socialist, republic, of, vietnam, was, established, in, the, new, government, gi, p, was, made, deputy, prime, minister, in, july, 1976, in, december, 1978, he, oversaw, the, successful, cambodian, vietnamese, war, which, drove, the, khmer, rouge, from, power, and, ended, the, cambodian, genocide, in, retaliation, cambodia, s, ally, china, responded, by, invading, the, cao, bang, province, of, vietnam, in, january, 1979, and, once, again, gi, p, was, in, overall, responsibility, for, the, response, which, drove, the, chinese, out, after, a, month, he, finally, retired, from, his, post, at, the, defense, ministry, in, 1981, and, retired, from, the, politburo, in, 1982, he, remained, on, the, central, committee, and, deputy, prime, minister, until, he, retired, in, 1991, gi, p, wrote, extensively, on, military, theory, and, strategy, his, works, include, big, victory, great, task, people, s, army, people, s, war, i, n, bi, n, ph, and, we, will, win, in, 1995, former, u, s, secretary, of, defense, robert, mcnamara, met, gi, p, to, ask, what, happened, on, 4, august, 1964, in, the, second, gulf, of, tonkin, incident, absolutely, nothing, gi, p, replied, gi, p, said, that, the, attack, on, 4, august, 1964, had, been, imaginary, the, final, evidence, that, there, had, not, been, any, vietnamese, attack, against, u, s, ships, on, the, night, of, 4, august, 1964, was, provided, by, the, release, of, a, slightly, sanitized, version, in, a, 1998, interview, william, westmoreland, criticized, the, battlefield, prowess, of, gi, p, stating, by, his, own, admission, by, early, 1969, i, think, he, had, lost, what, a, half, million, soldiers, he, reported, this, now, such, a, disregard, for, human, life, may, make, a, formidable, adversary, but, it, does, not, make, a, military, genius, an, american, commander, losing, men, like, that, would, hardly, have, lasted, more, than, a, few, weeks, american, historian, derek, frisby, criticized, westmoreland, s, view, which, he, said, reflected, a, failure, in, understanding, gi, p, s, core, philosophy, of, revolutionary, war, according, to, frisby, giap, understood, that, protracted, warfare, would, cost, many, lives, but, that, did, not, always, translate, into, winning, or, losing, the, war, in, the, final, analysis, giap, won, the, war, despite, losing, many, battles, and, as, long, as, the, army, survived, to, fight, another, day, the, idea, of, vietnam, lived, in, the, hearts, of, the, people, who, would, support, it, and, that, is, the, essence, of, revolutionary, war, nixon, s, secretary, of, state, henry, kissinger, said, we, fought, a, military, war, our, opponents, fought, a, political, one, we, sought, physical, attrition, our, opponents, aimed, for, our, psychological, exhaustion, in, the, process, we, lost, sight, of, one, of, the, cardinal, maxims, of, guerrilla, war, the, guerrilla, wins, if, he, does, not, lose, the, conventional, army, loses, if, it, does, not, win, the, north, vietnamese, used, their, armed, forces, the, way, a, bull, fighter, uses, his, cape, to, keep, us, lunging, in, areas, of, marginal, political, importance, compared, to, other, north, vietnamese, leaders, who, favored, an, all, out, quick, offensive, in, the, south, to, bring, victory, in, a, short, period, like, l, du, n, gi, p, was, relatively, cautious, and, he, believed, in, a, more, protracted, military, struggle, which, would, not, be, as, costly, in, manpower, however, he, was, willing, to, spend, the, lives, of, his, soldiers, with, what, american, commanders, would, regard, as, reckless, abandon, if, that, was, what, it, took, to, win, the, war, gi, p, explained, to, american, journalist, stanley, karnow, in, 1990, we, were, not, strong, enough, to, drive, out, a, half, million, american, troops, that, wasn, t, our, aim, our, intention, was, to, break, the, will, of, the, american, government, to, continue, the, war, westmoreland, was, wrong, to, expect, that, his, superior, firepower, would, grind, us, down, if, we, had, focused, on, the, balance, of, forces, we, would, have, been, defeated, in, two, hours, we, were, waging, a, people, s, war, america, s, sophisticated, arms, electronic, devices, and, all, the, rest, were, to, no, avail, in, the, end, in, war, there, are, two, factors, human, beings, and, weapons, ultimately, though, human, beings, are, the, decisive, factor, after, the, conclusion, of, the, vietnam, war, gi, p, extensively, wrote, about, his, military, strategy, the, subsequent, passage, from, one, of, his, books, explains, his, method, of, defeating, a, powerful, foreign, enemy, the, war, of, liberation, is, a, protracted, war, and, a, hard, war, in, which, we, must, rely, mainly, on, ourselves, for, we, are, strong, politically, but, weak, materially, while, the, enemy, is, very, weak, politically, but, stronger, materially, guerrilla, warfare, is, a, means, of, fighting, a, revolutionary, war, that, relies, on, the, heroic, spirit, to, triumph, over, modern, weapons, it, is, the, means, whereby, the, people, of, a, weak, badly, equipped, country, can, stand, up, against, an, aggressive, army, possessing, better, equipment, and, techniques, the, correct, tactics, for, a, protracted, revolutionary, war, are, to, wage, guerrilla, warfare, to, advance, from, guerrilla, warfare, to, regular, warfare, and, then, closely, combine, these, two, forms, of, war, to, develop, from, guerrilla, to, mobile, and, then, to, siege, warfare, accumulate, a, thousand, small, victories, to, turn, into, one, great, success, in, 2009, gi, p, became, a, prominent, critic, of, bauxite, mining, in, vietnam, following, government, plans, to, open, large, areas, of, the, central, highlands, to, the, practice, gi, p, supported, a, 1980s, study, in, which, experts, advised, against, mining, that, damaged, the, environment, and, national, security, on, 4, october, 2013, the, communist, party, of, vietnam, and, government, officials, announced, that, v, nguy, n, gi, p, had, died, aged, 102, at, 18, 09, local, time, at, central, military, hospital, 108, in, hanoi, he, was, given, a, state, funeral, on, 12, 13, october, and, his, body, was, laid, in, state, at, the, national, morgue, in, hanoi, until, his, burial, in, his, home, province, of, qu, ng, b, nh, after, his, death, several, cities, in, vietnam, renamed, some, of, their, most, prominent, streets, after, him
