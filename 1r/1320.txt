suicide, from, which, yohannes, was, rewarded, in, ammunition, and, artillery, he, regarded, islam, as, a, hindrance, to, the, stability, of, the, state, and, worked, to, strengthen, christian, dominance, in, ethiopia, its, estimated, that, he, had, converted, 550, 000, oromos, and, jebertis, to, christianity, in, foreign, policy, he, had, disagreements, and, military, conflicts, with, both, isma, il, pasha, of, the, khedivate, of, egypt, and, muhammad, ahmad, during, the, latter, s, mahdist, war, on, the, side, of, his, father, mercha, wolde, kidan, yohannes, descended, from, the, ruling, family, of, tembien, where, both, his, father, and, grandfather, bore, the, traditional, title, of, um, tembien, while, his, mother, silas, dimtsu, was, a, daughter, of, balg, da, demtsu, of, enderta, and, tabotu, woldu, of, agame, hence, a, niece, of, sabagadis, woldu, he, thus, descended, from, the, ruling, families, of, tembien, agame, and, enderta, yohannes, solomonic, lineage, is, through, his, paternal, grandmother, woizero, workewoha, kalekristoss, of, adwa, the, granddaughter, of, ras, mikael, sehul, and, his, wife, aster, iyasu, daughter, of, empress, mentewab, and, melmal, iyasu, who, was, a, solomonic, prince, and, nephew, of, emperor, bakaffa, therefore, yohannes, is, descendent, from, the, gondar, branch, of, the, solomonic, dynasty, the, story, of, the, first, half, of, his, life, is, poorly, documented, even, the, date, of, his, birth, is, uncertain, various, sources, place, it, between, 1831, and, 1837, the, available, sources, merely, indicate, that, he, was, the, youngest, of, his, siblings, that, he, had, a, seriously, ailing, childhood, that, he, received, some, church, education, and, that, he, was, initiated, to, manhood, after, killing, some, wild, animals, lions, and, or, elephants, for, trophies, the, first, mention, of, his, appearance, in, the, political, arena, comes, up, in, connection, with, his, visit, to, the, imperial, court, of,

ka, a, rebelled, against, the, rule, of, tewodros, what, prompted, his, rebellion, is, not, well, established, often, two, explanations, which, are, not, essentially, contradictory, are, forwarded, by, the, sources, the, first, is, related, to, his, dissatisfaction, with, the, rank, and, function, given, to, him, by, the, sovereign, while, the, second, interprets, his, rebellion, as, a, response, to, the, appeal, of, abun, salama, who, in, 1867, wrote, from, prison, to, many, notables, condemning, his, perceived, injustices, of, tewodros, in, any, case, for, some, time, he, together, with, his, followers, retired, to, the, eastern, lowlands, and, found, refuge, among, the, afar, from, which, ethnic, group, he, married, a, muslim, after, she, had, been, baptized, with, the, name, tebaba, sellasie, returning, to, the, highlands, he, raised, more, men, and, began, his, military, campaign, in, the, years, 1864, 1867, he, consecutively, defeated, um, seraye, gebre, mikael, d, jazma, barya, u, gebre, sadeq, of, adwa, and, d, jazma, tekle, giyorgis, qalos, of, shire, barya, u, transferred, his, allegiance, to, ka, a, whom, he, served, faithfully, until, he, was, killed, in, a, battle, some, ten, years, later, tekle, giyorgis, who, had, killed, ka, a, s, mother, silass, fell, in, battle, and, ka, a, subsequently, assumed, his, title, of, d, jazma, ka, a, then, formed, an, alliance, with, wag, um, gobez, gebre, medhin, of, lasta, against, tewodros, and, began, to, harass, the, imperial, representatives, on, both, sides, of, the, mareb, river, he, defeated, the, governors, of, selewa, and, kilte, awulaelo, in, hamasien, d, jazma, haylu, tewolde, medhen, who, contemplated, resistance, was, confined, and, replaced, with, d, jazma, later, ras, woldemichael, solomon, who, had, actively, participated, in, ka, a, s, military, campaign, against, the, imperial, officials, in, tigray, the, imperial, ambitions, of, behaile, selassie, are, consolidated, towards, the, end, of, the, reign, of, tewodros, ii, as, early, as, 1867, he, presented, himself, during, a, correspondence, with, the, british, as, ruler, of, ethiopia, during, the, same, year, a, diplomatic, dispute, between, tewodros, and, the, british, government, led, the, expedition, to, abyssinia, in, order, to, free, the, european, captives, imprisoned, there, by, tewodros, from, february, 1868, yohannes, came, into, contact, with, british, officers, including, the, commander, of, the, expedition, sir, robert, napier, who, sends, major, james, augustus, grant, a, british, explorer, to, meet, the, ruler, of, tigray, yohannes, is, then, perceived, by, james, as, a, weak, and, easily, manipulated, man, aspiring, to, become, a, great, leader, of, the, ethiopian, empire, after, three, hearings, yohannes, officially, agrees, to, help, napier, this, then, facilitates, the, provisioning, of, the, troops, by, installing, markets, near, the, main, camp, sites, yohannes, assures, the, british, that, he, will, help, them, with, all, power, yohannes, undertakes, to, protect, the, supply, routes, from, the, coast, to, magdala, and, to, repress, those, who, disturb, the, telegraph, in, return, yohannes, asked, napier, during, a, meeting, on, february, 28, 1868, for, the, participation, of, british, forces, in, his, fight, against, wagshum, gobeze, napier, refused, but, maintained, the, possibility, after, the, campaign, of, military, assistance, which, yohannes, and, his, 10, 000, men, greatly, needed, on, april, 10, 1868, the, expeditionary, force, arrived, at, the, foot, of, magdala, and, three, days, later, after, refusing, to, surrender, to, the, british, the, n, gus, n, g, st, tewodros, ii, committed, suicide, napier, s, victory, and, the, ease, with, which, the, expedition, reached, magdala, was, made, possible, by, yohannes, the, british, officers, themselves, admit, that, they, were, lucky, to, have, obtained, the, cooperation, of, the, leader, of, tigray, a, report, written, by, one, of, the, british, officers, stating, that, the, british, army, could, not, have, reached, magdala, during, this, season, without, having, received, the, help, of, the, chiefs, and, the, people, of, the, country, in, return, for, the, help, that, yohannes, provided, the, british, he, received, military, equipment, estimated, at, 500, 000, pounds, sterling, including, six, mortars, six, howitzers, approximately, 900, muskets, and, rifles, ammunition, powder, and, 585, 480, primers, percussion, this, armament, is, added, to, the, already, important, arsenal, of, yohannes, after, the, magdala, expedition, the, british, disengaged, completely, and, yohannes, offers, of, cooperation, were, rejected, or, ignored, even, after, his, seizure, of, imperial, power, he, failed, to, arouse, the, interest, of, the, british, nevertheless, the, napier, expedition, had, an, impact, on, the, struggle, for, power, in, addition, to, military, equipment, a, british, instructor, john, c, kirkham, agrees, to, stay, in, ethiopia, to, train, the, troops, of, yohannes, he, is, responsible, for, training, the, troops, of, yohannes, and, preparing, them, for, the, use, of, modern, weapons, received, from, the, british, according, to, the, historian, bahru, zewde, the, combination, of, new, weapons, and, the, training, provided, by, john, kirkham, determined, the, fight, against, tekle, giyorgis, following, the, death, of, tewodros, gobeze, gebre, medhin, had, himself, crowned, as, n, gus, n, g, st, tekle, giyorgis, ii, he, successfully, suppressed, rebellions, of, ras, wolde, maryam, of, begemender, and, fares, ali, of, yejju, yohannes, however, refused, to, acknowledge, the, new, metropolitan, abun, atnatyos, sent, from, alexandria, in, june, 1869, and, kept, him, in, his, dominion, however, tekle, giyorgis, is, not, fooled, and, he, quickly, understands, yohannes, intentions, although, having, a, much, larger, army, in, numbers, tekle, giyorgis, does, not, have, the, modern, weapons, which, yohannes, have, in, addition, to, that, his, troops, include, many, soldiers, from, tigray, and, he, fears, their, change, of, camp, in, favor, of, yohannes, thus, tekle, giyorgis, seeks, the, collaboration, of, menelik, in, order, to, consolidate, a, purely, numerical, advantage, however, the, negus, of, shewa, refuses, to, join, in, the, fight, preferring, to, see, the, two, great, warlords, confront, each, other, and, tire, each, other, finally, on, 11, july, 1871, tekle, giyorgis, confronted, ka, a, in, the, battle, of, adwa, but, was, defeated, and, confined, to, enda, abba, selma, tembien, where, he, would, die, two, years, later, the, principle, of, yohannes, s, internal, policy, was, to, continue, the, legacy, of, tewodros, ii, by, trying, to, unite, ethiopia, to, ensure, the, realization, of, this, policy, he, toured, each, region, and, meeting, appointed, governors, usually, from, the, local, nobility, regardless, of, their, former, attitudes, toward, him, as, long, as, they, submitted, and, expressed, to, him, their, unflinching, loyalty, he, thus, managed, as, the, contemporary, english, vice, consul, put, it, to, hold, the, scales, of, justice, with, a, firm, and, even, hand, it, was, in, 1884, the, boast, of, king, yohannes, that, a, child, could, pass, through, his, dominions, unharmed, in, the, first, six, years, of, his, reign, he, succeeded, in, achieving, the, unity, of, the, predominantly, christian, provinces, including, wag, and, lasta, semien, and, begemder, sayint, gojjam, wollo, and, shewa, he, crowned, menelik, king, of, shewa, in, 1878, and, tekle, haymanot, king, of, gojjam, and, kaffa, in, 1881, and, encouraged, them, to, expand, their, empire, to, the, south, east, and, west, however, this, advice, created, rivalry, between, the, two, regional, kings, which, came, to, a, climax, in, the, battle, of, embabo, in, june, 1882, yohannes, reprimanded, both, of, them, for, fighting, without, his, permission, punished, them, by, taking, away, a, province, from, the, jurisdiction, of, each, of, them, and, defined, the, direction, of, territories, to, be, conquered, by, each, of, the, two, kings, when, yohannes, was, crowned, emperor, he, established, his, capital, in, debre, tabor, which, was, his, seat, for, a, decade, before, he, shifted, the, capital, in, 1881, to, mekelle, but, he, still, retained, debre, tabor, as, his, primary, residence, yohannes, inherited, the, empire, encumbered, with, three, religious, questions, which, provoked, him, to, seek, a, solution, the, internal, dissensions, of, the, ethiopian, orthodox, tewahedo, church, eoc, islam, and, christian, foreign, missionary, activities, he, regarded, all, of, them, as, menaces, to, the, unity, and, stability, of, the, state, by, 1878, yohannes, was, ready, to, tackle, the, problems, by, summoning, a, council, at, boru, meda, wollo, most, of, the, high, dignitaries, and, notables, of, ethiopia, were, present, at, the, council, the, leading, theologians, of, the, three, major, disputing, groups, of, the, eoc, karra, predominant, in, the, north, s, gga, or, ost, l, d, t, prevalent, in, begemeder, and, shewa, and, q, bat, based, in, gojjam, and, lasta, tried, to, defend, their, respective, doctrines, yohannes, readily, accepted, corrections, made, by, a, notable, on, procedural, matters, apparently, he, had, a, long, prepared, plan, for, the, council, as, he, had, a, letter, from, the, patriarch, of, alexandria, read, out, at, the, end, of, the, disputation, which, endorsed, the, imperial, tenet, the, policy, transcended, yohannes, s, reign, though, there, were, indications, that, the, suppressed, tenets, had, by, no, means, been, eradicated, yohannes, was, known, to, harbor, deep, resentment, towards, islam, a, sudanese, official, was, reported, stating, yohannes, is, the, most, hateful, of, the, abyssinians, towards, islam, someone, who, knew, him, told, me, that, if, he, saw, a, muslim, in, the, morning, it, would, depress, him, so, that, he, would, immediately, take, the, cross, which, he, worships, and, put, it, over, his, face, during, the, council, at, boru, meda, he, summoned, the, major, oromo, chiefs, of, wollo, according, to, an, ethiopian, chronicler, yohannes, told, them, we, are, your, apostles, all, this, used, to, be, christian, land, until, gragn, ruined, and, misled, it, now, let, all, whether, muslim, or, galla, believe, in, the, name, of, jesus, christ, if, you, wish, to, live, in, peace, and, preserve, your, belongings, become, christians, it, is, estimated, that, by, 1880, some, 50, 000, jebertis, tigrinya, speaking, muslims, and, 500, 000, oromos, had, been, forced, to, convert, to, christianity, from, islam, throughout, his, reign, yohannes, was, embroiled, in, military, struggles, on, his, northern, frontiers, first, was, from, khedive, isma, il, pasha, of, egypt, who, sought, to, bring, the, entire, nile, river, basin, under, his, rule, the, egyptians, flirted, with, encouraging, menelik, of, shewa, against, the, king, but, earned, menelik, s, enmity, by, marching, from, the, port, of, zeila, and, occupying, the, city, state, of, harar, on, 11, october, 1875, both, menelik, and, yohannes, had, regarded, harar, as, a, renegade, province, of, ethiopia, and, egyptian, seizure, of, the, emirate, was, not, welcomed, to, either, of, them, the, egyptians, then, marched, into, northern, ethiopia, from, their, coastal, possessions, around, the, port, of, massawa, yohannes, pleaded, with, the, british, to, stop, their, egyptian, allies, and, even, withdrew, from, his, own, territory, in, order, to, show, the, europeans, that, he, was, the, wronged, party, and, that, the, khedive, was, the, aggressor, however, yohannes, soon, realized, that, the, europeans, would, not, stop, the, khedive, of, egypt, and, so, he, gathered, up, his, armies, and, marched, to, meet, the, egyptian, force, the, two, armies, met, at, gundet, also, called, guda, gude, on, the, morning, of, 16, november, 1875, the, egyptians, were, tricked, into, marching, into, a, narrow, and, steep, valley, and, were, wiped, out, by, ethiopian, gunners, surrounding, the, valley, from, the, surrounding, mountains, virtually, the, entire, egyptian, force, along, with, its, many, officers, of, european, and, north, american, background, were, killed, news, of, this, huge, defeat, was, suppressed, in, egypt, for, fear, that, it, would, undermine, the, government, of, the, khedive, a, new, egyptian, force, was, assembled, and, sent, to, avenge, the, defeat, at, gundet, the, egyptians, were, defeated, again, at, the, battle, of, gura, 7, 9, march, 1876, where, the, ethiopians, were, led, again, by, the, emperor, and, his, loyal, general, the, capable, and, future, ras, alula, engida, this, victory, was, followed, by, menelik, s, submission, to, yohannes, on, 20, march, 1878, and, in, return, yohannes, recognized, menelik, s, hereditary, right, to, the, title, of, king, negus, of, shewa, and, re, crowned, him, on, 26, march, yohannes, took, this, opportunity, to, tie, the, shewan, king, more, closely, to, him, by, arranging, for, menelik, s, daughter, zewditu, the, future, empress, of, ethiopia, in, her, own, right, to, be, married, to, his, own, son, and, heir, ras, araya, selassie, victor, of, the, egyptian, ethiopian, war, and, undisputed, neguse, negest, in, 1878, yohannes, was, at, the, high, point, of, his, reign, see, ethiopian, aristocratic, and, court, titles, emperor, yohannes, also, convened, a, general, council, of, the, ethiopian, church, at, boru, meda, later, in, 1878, which, brought, an, end, to, the, ongoing, theological, dispute, in, the, local, church, christians, muslims, and, pagans, were, given, respectively, two, three, and, five, years, to, conform, to, the, council, s, decisions, non, christians, were, forbidden, from, participating, in, the, government, unless, they, converted, and, were, baptized, the, muslims, were, given, three, months, while, the, pagans, had, to, become, christians, immediately, having, concluded, that, wollo, was, worth, a, mass, as, harold, marcus, wryly, puts, it, his, retainer, ras, mohammed, of, wollo, became, disobedient, of, the, tax, rules, which, he, and, the, entire, wollo, refused, to, pay, tax, to, the, government, in, which, emperor, yohannes, had, discovered, ras, mohammed, was, conspiring, with, the, turks, the, ottoman, empire, because, of, his, muslim, affiliation, ras, mohammed, was, brought, to, emperor, yohannes, and, was, confronted, of, his, conspiracy, in, helping, the, muslim, colonizer, and, to, bring, down, the, judeo, christian, empire, ras, mohammed, was, siding, with, muslim, affiliates, of, turkey, after, meeting, with, king, yohannes, and, in, learning, that, if, he, were, to, assist, the, turks, in, the, end, he, and, the, rest, of, ethiopia, would, become, a, slave, to, the, arab, muslim, world, ras, mohammed, then, chose, to, become, a, christian, to, later, inherit, a, christian, name, later, negus, mikael, of, wollo, the, emperor, stood, as, his, godfather, at, his, baptism, the, new, convert, was, given, menelik, of, shewa, s, other, daughter, shewarega, menelik, as, his, wife, yohannes, went, one, step, further, and, pressured, menelik, to, expel, all, of, the, roman, catholic, missionaries, from, shewa, however, this, time, instead, of, a, single, archbishop, he, requested, that, patriarch, cyril, send, four, to, serve, the, large, number, of, christians, in, ethiopia, who, arrived, in, 1881, they, were, led, by, abuna, petros, as, archbishop, abuna, matewos, for, shewa, abuna, luqas, for, gojjam, and, abuna, markos, for, gondar, abuna, markos, died, shortly, after, arriving, so, his, diocese, was, included, with, that, of, abuna, atnatewos, it, was, the, first, time, that, the, coptic, patriarch, of, alexandria, had, appointed, four, bishops, for, ethiopia, when, muhammad, ahmad, proclaimed, himself, the, mahdi, a, prophesied, islamic, leader, who, would, precede, the, day, of, judgement, and, incited, turkish, sudan, into, a, long, and, violent, revolt, his, followers, successfully, drove, part, of, the, egyptian, garrisons, out, of, sudan, and, isolated, the, rest, at, suakin, and, at, various, posts, in, the, south, yohannes, agreed, to, british, requests, to, allow, these, egyptian, soldiers, to, evacuate, through, his, lands, with, the, understanding, that, the, british, empire, would, then, support, his, claims, on, important, ports, like, massawa, on, the, red, sea, to, import, weapons, and, ammunition, in, the, event, that, egypt, was, forced, to, withdraw, from, them, this, was, formalized, in, a, treaty, signed, with, the, british, at, adwa, known, as, the, hewett, treaty, according, to, the, treaty, the, ethiopians, would, allow, the, egyptians, to, safely, evacuate, out, of, certain, cities, such, as, kassala, which, aggravated, the, mahdists, even, more, ras, alula, engida, defeated, an, invading, mahdist, army, at, the, battle, of, kufit, on, 23, september, 1885, about, the, same, time, italy, took, control, of, the, port, of, massawa, frustrating, ethiopian, hopes, and, angering, yohannes, yohannes, attempted, to, work, out, some, kind, of, understanding, with, the, italians, so, he, could, turn, his, attention, to, the, more, pressing, problem, of, the, mahdists, although, ras, alula, took, it, upon, himself, to, attack, italian, units, that, were, on, both, sides, of, the, ill, defined, frontier, between, the, two, powers, domestic, problems, increased, when, the, neguses, of, both, gojjam, and, shewa, rebelled, against, yohannes, and, the, emperor, had, to, turn, his, attention, from, the, encroaching, italians, to, deal, with, his, rebellious, vassals, yohannes, brutally, crushed, the, gojjame, rebellion, but, before, he, could, turn, his, attention, to, shewa, news, arrived, that, the, mahdist, forces, had, sacked, gondar, and, burned, its, holy, churches, he, marched, north, from, gojjam, to, confront, the, armies, of, the, mahdi, yohannes, was, killed, by, the, mahdits, at, the, battle, of, gallabat, that, took, place, on, 9, 10, march, 1889, in, metemma, near, the, sudanese, border, evidence, suggests, that, emperor, yohannes, had, acted, rashly, and, had, made, himself, vulnerable, going, beyond, enemy, lines, in, a, range, of, enemy, shots, as, victory, was, going, to, his, side, mortally, wounded, from, a, gunshot, he, had, been, carried, to, his, tent, where, he, announced, that, his, nephew, ras, mengesha, was, actually, his, natural, son, and, named, him, his, heir, his, elder, son, ras, araya, selassie, had, died, a, few, years, earlier, he, died, hours, later, although, the, ethiopian, army, had, almost, annihilated, their, opponents, in, this, battle, hearing, that, their, ruler, had, been, slain, shattered, their, morale, and, they, were, scattered, by, the, nearly, beaten, sudanese, army, yohannes, s, body, was, carried, back, to, tigray, guarded, by, a, small, party, who, were, overtaken, by, the, mahdist, troops, of, zeki, tummal, near, the, atbara, river, who, captured, the, sovereign, s, body, augustus, b, wylde, who, claimed, to, have, heard, the, story, from, a, priest, who, managed, to, escape, the, slaughter, wrote, how, yohannes, uncle, ras, araya, stood, beside, the, body, of, his, dead, master, with, a, few, of, his, soldiers, and, the, bravest, of, the, king, s, servants, who, had, lost, their, all, and, had, no, more, prospects, to, live, for, according, to, wylde, as, he, saw, death, come, ras, areya, announced, that, he, was, now, old, and, done, for, that, his, time, had, come, and, it, was, useless, at, his, age, to, serve, another, master, that, he, knew, little, about, and, it, was, better, to, die, like, a, man, fighting, unbelievers, than, like, a, mule, in, a, stable, the, mahdists, brought, the, emperor, s, body, back, to, their, capital, at, omdurman, where, the, head, was, put, on, a, pike, and, paraded, through, the, streets, on, 2, may, of, the, same, year, 1889, emperor, menelik, signed, then, the, treaty, of, wuchale, with, the, italians, which, later, on, led, to, the, battle, of, adwa, although, a, group, of, tigrean, nobles, led, by, ras, alula, attempted, to, promote, the, claim, of, ras, mengesha, yohannes, the, natural, son, of, yohannes, as, emperor, many, of, the, dead, monarch, s, other, relatives, on, both,

ii, the, death, of, yohannes, reduced, the, influence, of, tigrayans, in, the, ethiopian, government, and, opened, the, way, for, italians, to, occupy, more, districts, previously, held, by, tigrayan, nobles, the, seizures, made, by, the, italians, at, this, time, ultimately, resulted, in, the, creation, of, the, colony, of, eritrea, and, the, defeat, of, italy, at, the, battle, of, adwa, at, the, hands, of, emperor, menelik, ii, the, tigrean, nobility, retained, influence, at, the, imperial, court, of, menelik, and, his, successors, although, not, at, the, level, they, enjoyed, under,

two, lines, of, descent, from, yohannes, iv, one, legitimate, and, one, natural, the, legitimate, line, is, through, his, elder, son, ras, araya, selassie, yohannes, araya, selassie, yohannes, was,

selassie, gugsa, s, relationship, with, emperor, haile, selassie, deteriorated, and, in, 1936, dejazmatch, haile, selassie, became, the, first, high, ranking, ethiopian, nobleman, to, defect, to, the, italians, when, the, fascist, forces, invaded, ethiopia, the, people, of, mekelle, ransacked, his, house, when, this, news, was, revealed, he, was, elevated, to, the, title, of, ras, by, the, king, of, italy, however, following, the, liberation, of, ethiopia, in, 1941, haile, selassie, gugsa, was, placed, under, house, arrest, and, regarded, as, a, traitor, emperor, haile, selassie, refused, to,

1974, following, the, fall, of, the, monarchy, he, died, shortly, thereafter, there, are, other, descendants, of, emperor, yohannes, iv, in, this, legitimate, line, but, because, of, the, wartime, actions, of, dejazmatch, haile, selassie, gugsa, this, branch, of, the, family, fell, into, disfavor, at, the, imperial, court, and, lost, its, position, and, influence, the, second, natural, line, is, through, ras, mengesha, yohannes, and, is, the, better, known, line, although, ras, mengesha, yohannes, ended, his, days, under, house, arrest, for, his, repeated, rebelling, against, emperor, menelik, ii, ras, mengesha, s, son, ras, seyoum, mengesha, first, became, governor, of, western, tigray, and, following, the, treason, of, his, cousin, dejazmatch, haile, selassie, gugsa, became,

ras, seyoum, mengesha, was, killed, during, the, abortive, coup, by, the, imperial, bodyguard, in, 1960, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ras, mengesha, seyoum, who, served, as, governor, and,

chronicle, of, yohannes, introduction, yohannes, undoubtedly, had, his, weaknesses, they, were, not, his, own, making, but, rather, imposed, on, him, either, by, external, pressure, or, inherited, by, his, deep, seated, values, and, traditional, norms, during, the, eighteen, years, of, his, reign, he, was, preoccupied, with, defending, his, country, against, external, aggressions, perpetrated, by, the, egyptians, the, italians, and, the, mahdists, yohannes, succeeded, to, a, large, extent, in, pacifying, the, country, and, expanding, the, empire, by, the, device, of, power, sharing, and, accommodation, guiding, principles, of, his, administration, were, patience, tolerance, and, forgiveness, as, well, as, a, tendency, to, preserve, the, status, quo, above, all, his, concerns, were, focused, on, promoting, peace, rather, than, his, own, personal, or, dynastic, gain, the, way, he, shared, his, authority, with, menelik, and, tekle, haymanot, eventually, resulted, in, undermining, his, own, authority, but, it, contributed, greatly, to, accelerating, the, process, of, reunification, of, the, ethiopian, empire, by, preserving, the, status, quo, in, the, regional, administration, the, uncertainty, and, fear, which, were, prevalent, under, previous, reigns, due, to, constant, changes, were, reduced, the, self, confidence, and, charitable, attitude, he, displayed, toward, his, vanquished, enemies, and, rivals, earned, him, the, high, esteem, of, his, subjects, early, in, his, career, after, he, defeated, and, seized, dejazmatch, gabre, mikael, of, seraye, who, was, responsible, for, the, death, of, his, own, mother, woizero, silas, dimtsu, not, only, did, he, forgive, him, but, within, a, year, gabre, mikael, was, reinstated, as, councilor, and, appeared, as, one, of, the, important, dignitaries, during, the, mission, of, major, grant, to, adwa, in, february, 1868, subsequently, gabre, mikael, s, son, dejazmach, birru, also, held, important, posts, ras, adal, of, gojjam, after, he, killed, his, own, cousin, ras, desta, tedla, gualu, the, newly, appointed, governor, by, yohannes, and, submitted, to, yohannes, and, asked, for, forgiveness, not, only, was, he, forgiven, but, he, was, given, the, command, over, gojjam, and, eventually, elevated, as, king, of, gojjam, and, keffa, under, the, name, of, tekle, haymanot, king, menelik, s, ambition, to, seize, the, imperial, crown, was, clearly, evident, since, his, escape, from, m, qdal, and, return, to, shoa, in, 1865, the, submission, of, menelik, to, yohannes, was, not, effected, until, 1878, after, yohannes, gained, substantial, advantage, over, his, rivals, in, terms, of, quality, and, quantity, of, firearms, as, a, result, of, the, booty, gathered, in, his, successive, victories, over, the, egyptian, army, at, gundet, and, gurae, in, 1875, and, 1876, respectively, this, advantage, remained, on, yohannes, s, side, throughout, his, reign, despite, repeated, pressure, from, his, advisers, on, two, occasions, in, 1878, at, the, time, of, menelik, s, submission, and, in, 1881, after, his, two, vassal, kings, menelik, and, tekl, haymanot, fought, against, each, other, at, embabo, to, remove, menelik, and, replace, him, if, need, be, by, one, of, his, cousins, such, as, meshesha, seifu, yohannes, refused, to, yield, on, grounds, that, he, was, not, going, to, destroy, an, effective, power, which, menelik, diligently, built, up, for, the, sake, of, eliminating, a, possible, threat, to, himself, finally, yohannes, heard, that, both, his, vassal, kings, have, defected, and, during, his, campaign, in, gojjam, tekle, haymant, confessed, that, they, had, concluded, an, agreement, to, help, one, another, and, rebel, against, the, authority, of, the, emperor, at, this, juncture, the, temptation, was, great, to, cross, the, abbay, river, blue, nile, to, showan, territory, and, eliminate, the, internal, threat, yohannes, s, priority, however, was, to, avert, the, external, threat, and, he, decided, to, face, the, mahdists, who, had, penetrated, twice, as, far, as, gonder, and, burnt, the, churches, pillaged, the, country, and, enslaved, people, throughout, his, reign, yohannes, demonstrated, selfless, devotion, to, the, defense, of, the, territorial, integrity, of, ethiopian, empire, against, successive, waves, of, external, aggression, by, egyptians, italians, and, mahdists, sudan, he, also, strove, within, the, parameters, of, what, was, possible, in, his, day, to, promote, the, welfare, of, his, people, his, devotion, to, his, country, and, people, culminated, in, the, supreme, sacrifice, of, his, life, at, the, border, of, his, empire, in, the, battle, of, metemma, his, imperial, majesty, john, iv, conquering, lion, of,
