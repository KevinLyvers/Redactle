an, ambush, his, conquests, for, the, most, part, were, not, consolidated, into, a, functioning, empire, while, his, failure, to, establish, a, stable, succession, led, to, a, fratricidal, feud,

the, kievan, rus, with, a, name, of, slavic, origin, as, opposed, to, his, predecessors, whose, names, had, old, norse, forms, some, scholars, see, the, name, of, sviatoslav, composed, of, the, slavic, roots, for, holy, and, glory, as, an, artificial, derivation, combining, the, names, of, his, predecessors, oleg, and, rurik, but, modern, researchers, question, the, possibility, of, such, a, translation, of, names, from, one, language, to, another, sveinald, or, sveneld, is, identical, to, sviatoslav, as, the, norse, rendition, of, the, slavic, name, the, 10th, century, eastern, roman, emperor, constantine, vii, s, greek, language, work, de, administrando, imperio, on, the, governance, of, the, empire, records, his, name, as, sfendostlabos, almost, nothing, is, known, about,

in, kiev, until, sviatoslav, reached, maturity, ca, 963, sviatoslav, was, tutored, by, a, varangian, named, asmud, the, tradition, of, employing, varangian, tutors, for, the, sons, of, ruling, princes, survived, well, into, the, 11th, century, sviatoslav, appears, to, have, had, little, patience, for, administration, his, life, was, spent, with, his, druzhina, roughly, company, in, permanent, warfare, against, neighboring, states, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, he, carried, neither, wagons, nor, kettles, on, his, expeditions, and, he, boiled, no, meat, rather, cutting, off, small, strips, of, horseflesh, game, or, beef, to, eat, after, roasting, it, on, the, coals, nor, did, he, have, a, tent, rather, spreading, out, a, horse, blanket, under, him, and, setting, his, saddle, under, his, head, and, all, his, retinue, did, likewise, sviatoslav, s, appearance, has, been, described, very, clearly, by, leo, the, deacon, who, himself, attended, the, meeting, of, sviatoslav, with, john, i, tzimiskes, following, deacon, s, memories, sviatoslav, was, a, bright, eyed, man, of, average, height, but, of, stalwart, build, much, more, sturdy, than, tzimiskes, he, had, a, bald, head, and, a, wispy, beard, and, wore, a, bushy, mustache, and, a, sidelock, as, a, sign, of, his, nobility, he, preferred, to, dress, in, white, and, it, was, noted, that, his, garments, were, much, cleaner, than, those, of, his, men, although, he, had, a, lot, in, common, with, his, warriors, he, wore, a, single, large, gold, earring, bearing, a, carbuncle, and, two, pearls, sviatoslav, s, mother, olga, converted, to, orthodox, christianity, at, the, court, of, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, porphyrogenitus, in, 957, sviatoslav, remained, a, pagan, all, of, his, life, in, the, treaty, of, 971, between, sviatoslav, and, the, byzantine, emperor, john, i, tzimiskes, the, rus, swore, by, the, gods, perun, and, veles, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, he, believed, that, his, warriors, druzhina, would, lose, respect, for, him, and, mock, him, if, he, became, a, christian, the, allegiance, of, his, warriors, was, of, paramount, importance, in, his, conquest, of, an, empire, that, stretched, from, the, volga, to, the, danube, very, little, is, known, of, sviatoslav, s, family, life, it, is, possible, that, he, was, not, the, only, or, the, eldest, son, of, his, parents, the, rus, byzantine, treaty, of, 945, mentions, a, certain, predslava, volodislav, s, wife, as, the, noblest, of, the, rus, women, after, olga, the, fact, that, predslava, was, oleg, s, mother, is, presented, by, vasily, tatishchev, he, also, speculated, that, predslava, came, from, the, hungarian, nobility, george, vernadsky, was, among, many, historians, to, speculate, that, volodislav, was, igor, s, eldest, son, and, heir, who, died, at, some, point, during, olga, s, regency, another, chronicle, relates, that, oleg, 977, was, the, eldest, son, of, igor, at, the, time, of, igor, s, death, sviatoslav, was, still, a, child, and, he, was, raised, by, his, mother, or, under, her, instructions, her, influence, however, did, not, extend, to, his, religious, observance, sviatoslav, had, several, children, but, the, origin, of, his, wives, is, not, specified, in, the, chronicle, by, his, wives, he, had, yaropolk, and, oleg, by, malusha, a, woman, of, indeterminate, origins, sviatoslav, had, vladimir, who, would, ultimately, break, with, his, father, s, paganism, and, convert, rus, to, christianity, john, skylitzes, reported, that, vladimir, had, a, brother, named, sfengus, whether, this, sfengus, was, a, son, of, sviatoslav, a, son, of, malusha, by, a, prior, or, subsequent, husband, or, an, unrelated, rus, nobleman, is, unclear, children, predslava, malusha, shortly, after, his, accession, to, the, throne, sviatoslav, began, campaigning, to, expand, rus, control, over, the, volga, valley, and, the, pontic, steppe, region, his, greatest, success, was, the, conquest, of, khazaria, which, for, centuries, had, been, one, of, the, strongest, states, of, eastern, europe, the, sources, are, not, clear, about, the, roots, of, the, conflict, between, khazaria, and, rus, so, several, possibilities, have, been, suggested, the, rus, had, an, interest, in, removing, the, khazar, hold, on, the, volga, trade, route, because, the, khazars, collected, duties, from, the, goods, transported, by, the, volga, historians, have, suggested, that, the, byzantine, empire, may, have, incited, the, rus, against, the, khazars, who, fell, out, with, the, byzantines, after, the, persecutions, of, the, jews, in, the, reign, of, romanus, i, lecapenus, sviatoslav, began, by, rallying, the, east, slavic, vassal, tribes, of, the, khazars, to, his, cause, those, who, would, not, join, him, such, as, the, vyatichs, were, attacked, and, forced, to, pay, tribute, to, the, kievan, rus, rather, than, to, the, khazars, according, to, a, legend, recorded, in, the, primary, chronicle, sviatoslav, sent, a, message, to, the, vyatich, rulers, consisting, of, a, single, phrase, i, want, to, come, at, you, old, east, slavic, khochiu, na, vy, iti, this, phrase, is, used, in, modern, russian, and, ukrainian, usually, misquoted, as, idu, na, vy, to, denote, an, unequivocal, declaration, of, one, s, intentions, proceeding, by, the, oka, and, volga, rivers, he, attacked, volga, bulgaria, he, employed, oghuz, and, pecheneg, mercenaries, in, this, campaign, perhaps, to, counter, the, superior, cavalry, of, the, khazars, and, bulgars, sviatoslav, destroyed, the, khazar, city, of, sarkel, around, 965, possibly, sacking, but, not, occupying, the, khazar, city, of, kerch, on, the, crimea, as, well, at, sarkel, he, established, a, rus, settlement, called, belaya, vyezha, the, white, tower, or, the, white, fortress, the, east, slavic, translation, for, sarkel, he, subsequently, destroyed, the, khazar, capital, of, atil, a, visitor, to, atil, wrote, soon, after, sviatoslav, s, campaign, the, rus, attacked, and, no, grape, or, raisin, remained, not, a, leaf, on, a, branch, the, exact, chronology, of, his, khazar, campaign, is, uncertain, and, disputed, for, example, mikhail, artamonov, and, david, christian, proposed, that, the, sack, of, sarkel, came, after, the, destruction, of, atil, although, ibn, haukal, reports, the, sack, of, samandar, by, sviatoslav, the, rus, leader, did, not, bother, to, occupy, the, khazar, heartlands, north, of, the, caucasus, mountains, permanently, on, his, way, back, to, kiev, sviatoslav, chose, to, strike, against, the, ossetians, and, force, them, into, subservience, therefore, khazar, successor, statelets, continued, their, precarious, existence, in, the, region, the, destruction, of, khazar, imperial, power, paved, the, way, for, kievan, rus, to, dominate, north, south, trade, routes, through, the, steppe, and, across, the, black, sea, routes, that, formerly, had, been, a, major, source, of, revenue, for, the, khazars, moreover, sviatoslav, s, campaigns, led, to, increased, slavic, settlement, in, the, region, of, the, saltovo, mayaki, culture, greatly, changing, the, demographics, and, culture, of, the, transitional, area, between, the, forest, and, the, steppe, the, annihilation, of, khazaria, was, undertaken, against, the, background, of, the, rus, byzantine, alliance, concluded, in, the, wake, of, igor, s, byzantine, campaign, in, 944, close, military, ties, between, the, rus, and, byzantium, are, illustrated, by, the, fact, reported, by, john, skylitzes, that, a, rus, detachment, accompanied, byzantine, emperor, nikephoros, phokas, in, his, victorious, naval, expedition, to, crete, in, 967, or, 968, nikephoros, sent, his, agent, kalokyros, to, persuade, sviatoslav, to, assist, the, byzantines, in, a, war, against, bulgaria, sviatoslav, was, paid, 15, 000, pounds, of, gold, and, set, sail, with, an, army, of, 60, 000, men, including, thousands, of, pecheneg, mercenaries, sviatoslav, defeated, the, bulgarian, ruler, boris, ii, and, proceeded, to, occupy, the, whole, of, northern, bulgaria, meanwhile, the, byzantines, bribed, the, pechenegs, to, attack, and, besiege, kiev, where, olga, stayed, with, sviatoslav, s, son, vladimir, the, siege, was, relieved, by, the, druzhina, of, pretich, and, immediately, following, the, pecheneg, retreat, olga, sent, a, reproachful, letter, to, sviatoslav, he, promptly, returned, and, defeated, the, pechenegs, who, continued, to, threaten, kiev, sviatoslav, refused, to, turn, his, balkan, conquests, over, to, the, byzantines, and, the, parties, fell, out, as, a, result, to, the, chagrin, of, his, boyars, and, his, mother, who, died, within, three, days, after, learning, about, his, decision, sviatoslav, decided, to, move, his, capital, to, pereyaslavets, in, the, mouth, of, the, danube, due, to, the, great, potential, of, that, location, as, a, commercial, hub, in, the, primary, chronicle, record, for, 969, sviatoslav, explains, that, it, is, to, pereyaslavets, the, centre, of, his, lands, all, the, riches, flow, gold, silks, wine, and, various, fruits, from, greece, silver, and, horses, from, hungary, and, bohemia, and, from, rus, furs, wax, honey, and, slaves, in, summer, 969, sviatoslav, left, rus, again, dividing, his, dominion, into, three, parts, each, under, a, nominal, rule, of, one, of, his, sons, at, the, head, of, an, army, that, included, pecheneg, and, magyar, auxiliary, troops, he, invaded, bulgaria, again, devastating, thrace, capturing, the, city, of, philippopolis, and, massacring, its, inhabitants, nikephoros, responded, by, repairing, the, defenses, of, constantinople, and, raising, new, squadrons, of, armored, cavalry, in, the, midst, of, his, preparations, nikephoros, was, overthrown, and, killed, by, john, tzimiskes, who, thus, became, the, new, byzantine, emperor, john, tzimiskes, first, attempted, to, persuade, sviatoslav, to, leave, bulgaria, but, he, was, unsuccessful, challenging, byzantine, authority, sviatoslav, crossed, the, danube, and, laid, siege, to, adrianople, causing, panic, in, the, streets, of, constantinople, in, summer, 970, later, that, year, the, byzantines, launched, a, counteroffensive, being, occupied, with, suppressing, a, revolt, brought, by, bardas, phokas, in, asia, minor, john, tzimiskes, sent, his, commander, in, chief, bardas, skleros, who, defeated, the, coalition, of, rus, pechenegs, magyars, and, bulgarians, in, the, battle, of, arcadiopolis, meanwhile, john, having, quelled, the, revolt, of, bardas, phokas, came, to, the, balkans, with, a, large, army, and, promoting, himself, as, the, liberator, of, bulgaria, from, sviatoslav, penetrated, the, impracticable, mountain, passes, and, shortly, thereafter, captured, marcianopolis, where, the, rus, were, holding, a, number, of, bulgar, princes, hostage, sviatoslav, retreated, to, dorostolon, which, the, byzantine, armies, besieged, for, sixty, five, days, cut, off, and, surrounded, sviatoslav, came, to, terms, with, john, and, agreed, to, abandon, the, balkans, renounce, his, claims, to, the, southern, crimea, and, return, west, of, the, dnieper, river, in, return, the, byzantine, emperor, supplied, the, rus, with, food, and, safe, passage, home, sviatoslav, and, his, men, set, sail, and, landed, on, berezan, island, at, the, mouth, of, the, dnieper, where, they, made, camp, for, the, winter, several, months, later, according, to, the, primary, chronicle, their, camp, was, devastated, by, famine, so, that, even, a, horse, s, head, could, not, be, bought, for, less, than, a, half, grivna, while, sviatoslav, s, campaign, brought, no, tangible, results, for, the, rus, it, weakened, the, bulgarian, state, and, left, it, vulnerable, to, the, attacks, of, basil, the, bulgar, slayer, four, decades, later, fearing, that, the, peace, with, sviatoslav, would, not, endure, the, byzantine, emperor, induced, the, pecheneg, khan, kurya, to, kill, sviatoslav, before, he, reached, kiev, this, was, in, line, with, the, policy, outlined, by, constantine, vii, porphyrogenitus, in, de, administrando, imperio, of, fomenting, strife, between, the, rus, and, the, pechenegs, according, to, the, slavic, chronicle, sveneld, attempted, to, warn, sviatoslav, to, avoid, the, dnieper, rapids, but, the, prince, slighted, his, wise, advice, and, was, ambushed, and, slain, by, the, pechenegs, when, he, tried, to, cross, the, cataracts, near, khortytsia, early, in, 972, the, primary,

parallels, with, sviatoslav, s, push, towards, constantinople, russia, s, southward, expansion, and, the, imperialistic, ventures, of, catherine, ii, in, the, balkans, seemed, to, have, been, legitimized, by, sviatoslav, s, campaigns, eight, centuries, earlier, among, the, works, created, during, the, war, was, yakov, knyazhnin, s, tragedy, olga, 1772, the, russian, playwright, chose, to,
