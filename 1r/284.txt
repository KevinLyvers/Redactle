when, he, was, 15, he, attended, trinity, college, dublin, in, 1682, financed, by, godwin, s, son, willoughby, the, four, year, course, followed, a, curriculum, largely, set, in, the, middle, ages,

argue, both, sides, of, any, argument, or, topic, swift, was, an, above, average, student, but, not, exceptional, and, received, his, b, a, in, 1686, by, special, grace, swift, was, studying, for, his, master, s, degree, when, political, troubles, in, ireland, surrounding, the, glorious, revolution, forced, him, to, leave, for, england, in, 1688, where, his, mother, helped, him, get, a, position, as, secretary, and, personal, assistant, of, sir, william, temple, at, moor, park, farnham, temple, was, an, english, diplomat, who, had, arranged, the, triple, alliance, of, 1668, he, had, retired, from, public, service, to, his, country, estate, to, tend, his, gardens, and, write, his, memoirs, gaining, his, employer, s, confidence, swift, was, often, trusted, with, matters, of, great, importance, within, three, years, of, their, acquaintance, temple, introduced, his, secretary, to, william, iii, and, sent, him, to, london, to, urge, the, king, to, consent, to, a, bill, for, triennial, parliaments, swift, took, up, his, residence, at, moor, park, where, he, met, esther, johnson, then, eight, years, old, the, daughter, of, an, impoverished, widow, who, acted, as, companion, to, temple, s, sister, lady, giffard, swift, was, her, tutor, and, mentor, giving, her, the, nickname, stella, and, the, two, maintained, a, close, but, ambiguous, relationship, for, the, rest, of, esther, s, life, in, 1690, swift, left, temple, for, ireland, because, of, his, health, but, returned, to, moor, park, the, following, year, the, illness, consisted, of, fits, of, vertigo, or, giddiness, now, believed, to, be, m, ni, re, s, disease, and, it, continued, to, plague, him, throughout, his, life, during, this, second, stay, with, temple, swift, received, his, m, a, from, hart, hall, oxford, in, 1692, he, then, left, moor, park, apparently, despairing, of, gaining, a, better, position, through, temple, s, patronage, in, order, to, become, an, ordained, priest, in, the, established, church, of, ireland, he, was, appointed, to, the, prebend, of, kilroot, in, the, diocese, of, connor, in, 1694, with, his, parish, located, at, kilroot, near, carrickfergus, in, county, antrim, swift, appears, to, have, been, miserable, in, his, new, position, being, isolated, in, a, small, remote, community, far, from, the, centres, of, power, and, influence, while, at, kilroot, however, he, may, well, have, become, romantically, involved, with, jane, waring, whom, he, called, varina, the, sister, of, an, old, college, friend, a, letter, from, him, survives, offering, to, remain, if, she, would, marry, him, and, promising, to, leave, and, never, return, to, ireland, if, she, refused, she, presumably, refused, because, swift, left, his, post, and, returned, to, england, and, temple, s, service, at, moor, park, in, 1696, and, he, remained, there, until, temple, s, death, there, he, was, employed, in, helping, to, prepare, temple, s, memoirs, and, correspondence, for, publication, during, this, time, swift, wrote, the, battle, of, the, books, a, satire, responding, to, critics, of, temple, s, essay, upon, ancient, and, modern, learning, 1690, though, battle, was, not, published, until, 1704, temple, died, on, 27, january, 1699, swift, normally, a, harsh, judge, of, human, nature, said, that, all, that, was, good, and, amiable, in, mankind, had, died, with, temple, he, stayed, on, briefly, in, england, to, complete, editing, temple, s, memoirs, and, perhaps, in, the, hope, that, recognition, of, his, work, might, earn, him, a, suitable, position, in, england, his, work, made, enemies, among, some, of, temple, s, family, and, friends, in, particular, temple, s, formidable, sister, martha, lady, giffard, who, objected, to, indiscretions, included, in, the, memoirs, moreover, she, noted, that, swift, had, borrowed, from, her, own, biography, an, accusation, that, swift, denied, swift, s, next, move, was, to, approach, king, william, directly, based, on, his, imagined, connection, through, temple, and, a, belief, that, he, had, been, promised, a, position, this, failed, so, miserably, that, he, accepted, the, lesser, post, of, secretary, and, chaplain, to, the, earl, of, berkeley, one, of, the, lords, justice, of, ireland, however, when, he, reached, ireland, he, found, that, the, secretaryship, had, already, been, given, to, another, he, soon, obtained, the, living, of, laracor, agher, and, rathbeggan, and, the, prebend, of, dunlavin, in, st, patrick, s, cathedral, dublin, swift, ministered, to, a, congregation, of, about, 15, at, laracor, which, was, just, over, four, and, a, half, miles, 7, 2, km, from, summerhill, county, meath, and, twenty, miles, 32, km, from, dublin, he, had, abundant, leisure, for, cultivating, his, garden, making, a, canal, after, the, dutch, fashion, of, moor, park, planting, willows, and, rebuilding, the, vicarage, as, chaplain, to, lord, berkeley, he, spent, much, of, his, time, in, dublin, and, travelled, to, london, frequently, over, the, next, ten, years, in, 1701, he, anonymously, published, the, political, pamphlet, a, discourse, on, the, contests, and, dissentions, in, athens, and, rome, swift, resided, in, trim, county, meath, after, 1700, he, wrote, many, of, his, works, during, this, period, in, february, 1702, swift, received, his, doctor, of, divinity, degree, from, trinity, college, dublin, that, spring, he, travelled, to, england, and, then, returned, to, ireland, in, october, accompanied, by, esther, johnson, now, 20, and, his, friend, rebecca, dingley, another, member, of, william, temple, s, household, there, is, a, great, mystery, and, controversy, over, swift, s, relationship, with, esther, johnson, nicknamed, stella, many, notably, his, close, friend, thomas, sheridan, believed, that, they, were, secretly, married, in, 1716, others, like, swift, s, housekeeper, mrs, brent, and, rebecca, dingley, who, lived, with, stella, all, through, her, years, in, ireland, dismissed, the, story, as, absurd, swift, certainly, did, not, wish, her, to, marry, anyone, else, in, 1704, when, their, mutual, friend, william, tisdall, informed, swift, that, he, intended, to, propose, to, stella, swift, wrote, to, him, to, dissuade, him, from, the, idea, although, the, tone, of, the, letter, was, courteous, swift, privately, expressed, his, disgust, for, tisdall, as, an, interloper, and, they, were, estranged, for, many, years, during, his, visits, to, england, in, these, years, swift, published, a, tale, of, a, tub, and, the, battle, of, the, books, 1704, and, began, to, gain, a, reputation, as, a, writer, this, led, to, close, lifelong, friendships, with, alexander, pope, john, gay, and, john, arbuthnot, forming, the, core, of, the, martinus, scriblerus, club, founded, in, 1713, swift, became, increasingly, active, politically, in, these, years, swift, supported, the, glorious, revolution, and, early, in, his, life, belonged, to, the, whigs, as, a, member, of, the, anglican, church, he, feared, a, return, of, the, catholic, monarchy, and, papist, absolutism, from, 1707, to, 1709, and, again, in, 1710, swift, was, in, london, unsuccessfully, urging, upon, the, whig, administration, of, lord, godolphin, the, claims, of, the, irish, clergy, to, the, first, fruits, and, twentieths, queen, anne, s, bounty, which, brought, in, about, 2, 500, a, year, already, granted, to, their, brethren, in, england, he, found, the, opposition, tory, leadership, more, sympathetic, to, his, cause, and, when, they, came, to, power, in, 1710, he, was, recruited, to, support, their, cause, as, editor, of, the, examiner, in, 1711, swift, published, the, political, pamphlet, the, conduct, of, the, allies, attacking, the, whig, government, for, its, inability, to, end, the, prolonged, war, with, france, the, incoming, tory, government, conducted, secret, and, illegal, negotiations, with, france, resulting, in, the, treaty, of, utrecht, 1713, ending, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, swift, was, part, of, the, inner, circle, of, the, tory, government, and, often, acted, as, mediator, between, henry, st, john, viscount, bolingbroke, the, secretary, of, state, for, foreign, affairs, 1710, 15, and, robert, harley, earl, of, oxford, lord, treasurer, and, prime, minister, 1711, 14, swift, recorded, his, experiences, and, thoughts, during, this, difficult, time, in, a, long, series, of, letters, to, esther, johnson, collected, and, published, after, his, death, as, a, journal, to, stella, the, animosity, between, the, two, tory, leaders, eventually, led, to, the, dismissal, of, harley, in, 1714, with, the, death, of, queen, anne, and, the, accession, of, george, i, that, year, the, whigs, returned, to, power, and, the, tory, leaders, were, tried, for, treason, for, conducting, secret, negotiations, with, france, swift, has, been, described, by, scholars, as, a, whig, in, politics, and, tory, in, religion, and, swift, related, his, own, views, in, similar, terms, stating, that, as, a, lover, of, liberty, i, found, myself, to, be, what, they, called, a, whig, in, politics, but, as, to, religion, i, confessed, myself, to, be, an, high, churchman, in, his, thoughts, on, religion, fearing, the, intense, partisan, strife, waged, over, religious, belief, in, seventeenth, century, england, swift, wrote, that, every, man, as, a, member, of, the, commonwealth, ought, to, be, content, with, the, possession, of, his, own, opinion, in, private, however, it, should, be, borne, in, mind, that, during, swift, s, time, period, terms, like, whig, and, tory, both, encompassed, a, wide, array, of, opinions, and, factions, and, neither, term, aligns, with, a, modern, political, party, or, modern, political, alignments, also, during, these, years, in, london, swift, became, acquainted, with, the, vanhomrigh, family, dutch, merchants, who, had, settled, in, ireland, then, moved, to, london, and, became, involved, with, one, of, the, daughters, esther, swift, furnished, esther, with, the, nickname, vanessa, derived, by, adding, essa, a, pet, form, of, esther, to, the, van, of, her, surname, vanhomrigh, and, she, features, as, one, of, the, main, characters, in, his, poem, cadenus, and, vanessa, the, poem, and, their, correspondence, suggest, that, esther, was, infatuated, with, swift, and, that, he, may, have, reciprocated, her, affections, only, to, regret, this, and, then, try, to, break, off, the, relationship, esther, followed, swift, to, ireland, in, 1714, and, settled, at, her, old, family, home, celbridge, abbey, their, uneasy, relationship, continued, for, some, years, then, there, appears, to, have, been, a, confrontation, possibly, involving, esther, johnson, esther, vanhomrigh, died, in, 1723, at, the, age, of, 35, having, destroyed, the, will, she, had, made, in, swift, s, favour, another, lady, with, whom, he, had, a, close, but, less, intense, relationship, was, anne, long, a, toast, of, the, kit, cat, club, before, the, fall, of, the, tory, government, swift, hoped, that, his, services, would, be, rewarded, with, a, church, appointment, in, england, however, queen, anne, appeared, to, have, taken, a, dislike, to, swift, and, thwarted, these, efforts, her, dislike, has, been, attributed, to, a, tale, of, a, tub, which, she, thought, blasphemous, compounded, by, the, windsor, prophecy, where, swift, with, a, surprising, lack, of, tact, advised, the, queen, on, which, of, her, bedchamber, ladies, she, should, and, should, not, trust, the, best, position, his, friends, could, secure, for, him, was, the, deanery, of, st, patrick, s, this, was, not, in, the, queen, s, gift, and, anne, who, could, be, a, bitter, enemy, made, it, clear, that, swift, would, not, have, received, the, preferment, if, she, could, have, prevented, it, with, the, return, of, the, whigs, swift, s, best, move, was, to, leave, england, and, he, returned, to, ireland, in, disappointment, a, virtual, exile, to, live, like, a, rat, in, a, hole, once, in, ireland, however, swift, began, to, turn, his, pamphleteering, skills, in, support, of, irish, causes, producing, some, of, his, most, memorable, works, proposal, for, universal, use, of, irish, manufacture, 1720, drapier, s, letters, 1724, and, a, modest, proposal, 1729, earning, him, the, status, of, an, irish, patriot, this, new, role, was, unwelcome, to, the, government, which, made, clumsy, attempts, to, silence, him, his, printer, edward, waters, was, convicted, of, seditious, libel, in, 1720, but, four, years, later, a, grand, jury, refused, to, find, that, the, drapier, s, letters, which, though, written, under, a, pseudonym, were, universally, known, to, be, swift, s, work, were, seditious, swift, responded, with, an, attack, on, the, irish, judiciary, almost, unparalleled, in, its, ferocity, his, principal, target, being, the, vile, and, profligate, villain, william, whitshed, lord, chief, justice, of, ireland, also, during, these, years, he, began, writing, his, masterpiece, travels, into, several, remote, nations, of, the, world, in, four, parts, by, lemuel, gulliver, first, a, surgeon, and, then, a, captain, of, several, ships, better, known, as, gulliver, s, travels, much, of, the, material, reflects, his, political, experiences, of, the, preceding, decade, for, instance, the, episode, in, which, the, giant, gulliver, puts, out, the, lilliputian, palace, fire, by, urinating, on, it, can, be, seen, as, a, metaphor, for, the, tories, illegal, peace, treaty, having, done, a, good, thing, in, an, unfortunate, manner, in, 1726, he, paid, a, long, deferred, visit, to, london, taking, with, him, the, manuscript, of, gulliver, s, travels, during, his, visit, he, stayed, with, his, old, friends, alexander, pope, john, arbuthnot, and, john, gay, who, helped, him, arrange, for, the, anonymous, publication, of, his, book, first, published, in, november, 1726, it, was, an, immediate, hit, with, a, total, of, three, printings, that, year, and, another, in, early, 1727, french, german, and, dutch, translations, appeared, in, 1727, and, pirated, copies, were, printed, in, ireland, swift, returned, to, england, one, more, time, in, 1727, and, stayed, once, again, with, alexander, pope, the, visit, was, cut, short, when, swift, received, word, that, esther, johnson, was, dying, and, rushed, back, home, to, be, with, her, on, 28, january, 1728, johnson, died, swift, had, prayed, at, her, bedside, even, composing, prayers, for, her, comfort, swift, could, not, bear, to, be, present, at, the, end, but, on, the, night, of, her, death, he, began, to, write, his, the, death, of, mrs, johnson, he, was, too, ill, to, attend, the, funeral, at, st, patrick, s, many, years, later, a, lock, of, hair, assumed, to, be, johnson, s, was, found, in, his, desk, wrapped, in, a, paper, bearing, the, words, only, a, woman, s, hair, death, became, a, frequent, feature, of, swift, s, life, from, this, point, in, 1731, he, wrote, verses, on, the, death, of, dr, swift, his, own, obituary, published, in, 1739, in, 1732, his, good, friend, and, collaborator, john, gay, died, in, 1735, john, arbuthnot, another, friend, from, his, days, in, london, died, in, 1738, swift, began, to, show, signs, of, illness, and, in, 1742, he, may, have, suffered, a, stroke, losing, the, ability, to, speak, and, realising, his, worst, fears, of, becoming, mentally, disabled, i, shall, be, like, that, tree, he, once, said, i, shall, die, at, the, top, he, became, increasingly, quarrelsome, and, long, standing, friendships, like, that, with, thomas, sheridan, ended, without, sufficient, cause, to, protect, him, from, unscrupulous, hangers, ons, who, had, begun, to, prey, on, the, great, man, his, closest, companions, had, him, declared, of, unsound, mind, and, memory, however, it, was, long, believed, by, many, that, swift, was, actually, insane, at, this, point, in, his, book, literature, and, western, man, author, j, b, priestley, even, cites, the, final, chapters, of, gulliver, s, travels, as, proof, of, swift, s, approaching, insanity, bewley, attributes, his, decline, to, terminal, dementia, in, part, viii, of, his, series, the, story, of, civilization, will, durant, describes, the, final, years, of, swift, s, life, as, such, definite, symptoms, of, madness, appeared, in, 1738, in, 1741, guardians, were, appointed, to, take, care, of, his, affairs, and, watch, lest, in, his, outbursts, of, violence, he, should, do, himself, harm, in, 1742, he, suffered, great, pain, from, the, inflammation, of, his, left, eye, which, swelled, to, the, size, of, an, egg, five, attendants, had, to, restrain, him, from, tearing, out, his, eye, he, went, a, whole, year, without, uttering, a, word, in, 1744, alexander, pope, died, then, on, 19, october, 1745, swift, at, nearly, 78, died, after, being, laid, out, in, public, view, for, the, people, of, dublin, to, pay, their, last, respects, he, was, buried, in, his, own, cathedral, by, esther, johnson, s, side, in, accordance, with, his, wishes, the, bulk, of, his, fortune, 12, 000, was, left, to, found, a, hospital, for, the, mentally, ill, originally, known, as, st, patrick, s, hospital, for, imbeciles, which, opened, in, 1757, and, which, still, exists,

poetically, translated, it, from, the, latin, as, british, politician, michael, foot, was, a, great, admirer, of, swift, and, wrote, about, him, extensively, in, debts, of, honour, he, cites, with, approbation, a, theory, propounded, by, denis, johnston, that, offers, an, explanation, of, swift, s, behaviour, towards, stella, and, vanessa, pointing, to, contradictions, in, the, received, information, about, swift, s, origins, and, parentage, johnston, postulates, that, swift, s, real, father, was, sir, william, temple, s, father, sir, john, temple, who, was, master, of, the, rolls, in, dublin, at, the, time, it, is, widely, thought, that, stella, was, sir, william, temple, s, illegitimate, daughter, so, swift, was, sir, william, s, brother, and, stella, s, uncle, marriage, or, close, relations, between, swift, and, stella, would, therefore, have, been, incest, an, unthinkable, prospect, it, follows, that, swift, could, not, have, married, vanessa, either, without, stella, appearing, to, be, a, cast, off, mistress, which, he, would, not, contemplate, johnston, s, theory, is, expounded, fully, in, his, book, in, search, of, swift, he, is, also, cited, in, the, dictionary, of, irish, biography, and, the, theory, is, presented, without, attribution, in, the, concise, cambridge, history, of, english, literature, swift, was, a, prolific, writer, the,

pages, long, one, edition, of, his, correspondence, david, woolley, ed, p, lang, 1999, fills, three, volumes, swift, s, first, major, prose, work, a, tale, of, a, tub, demonstrates, many, of, the, themes, and, stylistic, techniques, he, would, employ, in, his, later, work, it, is, at, once, wildly, playful, and, funny, while, being, pointed, and, harshly, critical, of, its, targets, in, its,
