donald, ervin, knuth, k, n, u, k, nooth, born, january, 10, 1938, is, an, american, computer, scientist, and, mathematician, he, is, a, professor, emeritus, at, stanford, university, he, is, the, 1974, recipient, of, the, acm, turing, award, informally, considered, the, nobel, prize, of, computer, science, knuth, has, been, called, the, father, of, the, analysis, of, algorithms, knuth, is, the, author, of, the, multi, volume, work, the, art, of, computer, programming, he, contributed, to, the, development, of, the, rigorous, analysis, of, the, computational, complexity, of, algorithms, and, systematized, formal, mathematical, techniques, for, it, in, the, process, he, also, popularized, the, asymptotic, notation, in, addition, to, fundamental, contributions, in, several, branches, of, theoretical, computer, science, knuth, is, the, creator, of, the, tex, computer, typesetting, system, the, related, metafont, font, definition, language, and, rendering, system, and, the, computer, modern, family, of, typefaces, as, a, writer, and, scholar, knuth, created, the, web, and, cweb, computer, programming, systems, designed, to, encourage, and, facilitate, literate, programming, and, designed, the, mix, mmix, instruction, set, architectures, he, strongly, opposes, the, granting, of, software, patents, and, has, expressed, his, opinion, to, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, and, european, patent, organisation, donald, knuth, was, born, in, milwaukee, wisconsin, to, ervin, henry, knuth, and, louise, marie, bohning, he, describes, his, heritage, as, midwestern, lutheran, german, 66, his, father, owned, a, small, printing, business, and, taught, bookkeeping, while, a, student, at, milwaukee, lutheran, high, school, knuth, thought, of, ingenious, ways, to, solve, problems, for, example, in, eighth, grade, he, entered, a, contest, to, find, the, number, of, words, that, the, letters, in, ziegler, s, giant, bar, could, be, rearranged, to, create, the, judges, had, identified, 2, 500, such, words, with, time, gained, away, from, school, due, to, a, fake, stomachache, knuth, used, an, unabridged, dictionary, and, determined, whether, each, dictionary, entry, could, be, formed, using, the, letters, in, the, phrase, using, this, algorithm, he, identified, over, 4, 500, words, winning, the, contest, 3, as, prizes, the, school, received, a, new, television, and, enough, candy, bars, for, all, of, his, schoolmates, to, eat, knuth, received, a, scholarship, in, physics, to, the, case, institute, of, technology, now, part, of, case, western, reserve, university, in, cleveland, ohio, enrolling, in, 1956, he, also, joined, the, beta, nu, chapter, of, the, theta, chi, fraternity, while, studying, physics, at, case, knuth, was, introduced, to, the, ibm, 650, an, early, commercial, computer, after, reading, the, computer, s, manual, knuth, decided, to, rewrite, the, assembly, and, compiler, code, for, the, machine, used, in, his, school, because, he, believed, he, could, do, it, better, in, 1958, knuth, created, a, program, to, help, his, school, s, basketball, team, win, its, games, he, assigned, values, to, players, in, order, to, gauge, their, probability, of, scoring, points, a, novel, approach, that, newsweek, and, cbs, evening, news, later, reported, on, knuth, was, one, of, the, founding, editors, of, the, case, institute, s, engineering, and, science, review, which, won, a, national, award, as, best, technical, magazine, in, 1959, he, then, switched, from, physics, to, mathematics, and, received, two, degrees, from, case, in, 1960, his, bachelor, of, science, and, simultaneously, a, master, of, science, by, a, special, award, of, the, faculty, who, considered, his, work, exceptionally, outstanding, in, 1963, with, mathematician, marshall, hall, as, his, adviser, he, earned, a, phd, in, mathematics, from, the, california, institute, of, technology, with, a, thesis, titled, finite, semifields, and, projective, planes, in, 1963, after, receiving, his, phd, knuth, joined, caltech, s, faculty, as, an, assistant, professor, knuth, accepted, a, commission, to, write, a, book, on, computer, programming, language, compilers, while, working, on, this, project, he, decided, that, he, could, not, adequately, treat, the, topic, without, first, developing, a, fundamental, theory, of, computer, programming, which, became, the, art, of, computer, programming, he, originally, planned, to, publish, this, as, a, single, book, but, as, he, developed, his, outline, for, the, book, he, concluded, that, he, required, six, volumes, and, then, seven, to, thoroughly, cover, the, subject, he, published, the, first, volume, in, 1968, just, before, publishing, the, first, volume, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, knuth, left, caltech, to, accept, employment, with, the, institute, for, defense, analyses, communications, research, division, then, situated, on, the, princeton, campus, which, was, performing, mathematical, research, in, cryptography, to, support, the, national, security, agency, in, 1967, knuth, attended, a, society, for, industrial, and, applied, mathematics, conference, and, someone, asked, what, he, did, at, the, time, computer, science, was, partitioned, into, numerical, analysis, artificial, intelligence, and, programming, languages, based, on, his, study, and, the, art, of, computer, programming, book, knuth, decided, the, next, time, someone, asked, he, would, say, analysis, of, algorithms, in, 1969, knuth, left, his, position, at, princeton, to, join, the, stanford, university, faculty, where, he, became, fletcher, jones, professor, of, computer, science, in, 1977, he, became, professor, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, in, 1990, and, has, been, emeritus, since, 1993, knuth, is, a, writer, as, well, as, a, computer, scientist, the, best, way, to, communicate, from, one, human, being, to, another, is, through, story, in, the, 1970s, knuth, called, computer, science, a, totally, new, field, with, no, real, identity, and, the, standard, of, available, publications, was, not, that, high, a, lot, of, the, papers, coming, out, were, quite, simply, wrong, so, one, of, my, motivations, was, to, put, straight, a, story, that, had, been, very, badly, told, from, 1972, to, 1973, knuth, spent, a, year, at, the, university, of, oslo, among, people, such, as, ole, johan, dahl, this, is, where, he, had, originally, intended, to, write, the, seventh, volume, in, his, book, series, which, was, to, deal, with, programming, languages, but, knuth, had, finished, only, the, first, two, volumes, when, he, came, to, oslo, and, thus, spent, the, year, on, the, third, volume, next, to, teaching, the, third, volume, came, out, just, after, knuth, returned, to, stanford, in, 1973, by, 2011, volume, 4a, had, been, published, concrete, mathematics, a, foundation, for, computer, science, 2nd, ed, which, originated, with, an, expansion, of, the, mathematical, preliminaries, section, of, volume, 1, of, taocp, was, published, in, 1994, in, april, 2020, knuth, said, he, anticipated, that, volume, 4, will, have, at, least, parts, a, through, f, volume, 4b, was, published, in, october, 2022, knuth, is, also, the, author, of, surreal, numbers, a, mathematical, novelette, on, john, conway, s, set, theory, construction, of, an, alternate, system, of, numbers, instead, of, simply, explaining, the, subject, the, book, seeks, to, show, the, development, of, the, mathematics, knuth, wanted, the, book, to, prepare, students, for, doing, original, creative, research, in, 1995, knuth, wrote, the, foreword, to, the, book, a, b, by, marko, petkov, ek, herbert, wilf, and, doron, zeilberger, he, also, occasionally, contributes, language, puzzles, to, word, ways, the, journal, of, recreational, linguistics, knuth, has, delved, into, recreational, mathematics, he, contributed, articles, to, the, journal, of, recreational, mathematics, beginning, in, the, 1960s, and, was, acknowledged, as, a, major, contributor, in, joseph, madachy, s, mathematics, on, vacation, knuth, also, appears, in, a, number, of, numberphile, and, computerphile, videos, on, youtube, where, he, discusses, topics, from, writing, surreal, numbers, to, why, he, does, not, use, email, in, addition, to, his, writings, on, computer, science, knuth, a, lutheran, is, also, the, author, of, 3, 16, bible, texts, illuminated, in, which, he, examines, the, bible, by, a, process, of, systematic, sampling, namely, an, analysis, of, chapter, 3, verse, 16, of, each, book, each, verse, is, accompanied, by, a, rendering, in, calligraphic, art, contributed, by, a, group, of, calligraphers, led, by, hermann, zapf, knuth, was, invited, to, give, a, set, of, lectures, at, mit, on, the, views, on, religion, and, computer, science, behind, his, 3, 16, project, resulting, in, another, book, things, a, computer, scientist, rarely, talks, about, where, he, published, the, lectures, god, and, computer, science, knuth, strongly, opposes, granting, software, patents, to, trivial, solutions, that, should, be, obvious, but, has, expressed, more, nuanced, views, for, nontrivial, solutions, such, as, the, interior, point, method, of, linear, programming, he, has, expressed, his, disagreement, directly, to, both, the, united, states, patent, and, trademark, office, and, european, patent, organisation, in, the, 1970s, the, publishers, of, taocp, abandoned, monotype, in, favor, of, phototypesetting, knuth, became, so, frustrated, with, the, inability, of, the, latter, system, to, approach, the, quality, of, the, previous, volumes, which, were, typeset, using, the, older, system, that, he, took, time, out, to, work, on, digital, typesetting, and, created, tex, and, metafont, while, developing, tex, knuth, created, a, new, methodology, of, programming, which, he, called, literate, programming, because, he, believed, that, programmers, should, think, of, programs, as, works, of, literature, instead, of, imagining, that, our, main, task, is, to, instruct, a, computer, what, to, do, let, us, concentrate, rather, on, explaining, to, human, beings, what, we, want, a, computer, to, do, knuth, embodied, the, idea, of, literate, programming, in, the, web, system, the, same, web, source, is, used, to, weave, a, tex, file, and, to, tangle, a, pascal, source, file, these, in, their, turn, produce, a, readable, description, of, the, program, and, an, executable, binary, respectively, a, later, iteration, of, the, system, cweb, replaces, pascal, with, c, c, and, java, knuth, used, web, to, program, tex, and, metafont, and, published, both, programs, as, books, both, originally, published, the, same, year, tex, the, program, 1986, and, metafont, the, program, 1986, around, the, same, time, latex, the, now, widely, adopted, macro, package, based, on, tex, was, first, developed, by, leslie, lamport, who, later, published, its, first, user, manual, in, 1986, donald, knuth, married, nancy, jill, carter, on, 24, june, 1961, while, he, was, a, graduate, student, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, they, have, two, children, john, martin, knuth, and, jennifer, sierra, knuth, knuth, gives, informal, lectures, a, few, times, a, year, at, stanford, university, which, he, calls, computer, musings, he, was, a, visiting, professor, at, the, oxford, university, department, of, computer, science, in, the, united, kingdom, until, 2017, and, an, honorary, fellow, of, magdalen, college, knuth, is, an, organist, and, a, composer, he, and, his, father, served, as, organists, for, lutheran, congregations, knuth, and, his, wife, have, a, 16, rank, organ, in, their, home, in, 2016, he, completed, a, piece, for, organ, fantasia, apocalyptica, which, he, calls, a, translation, of, the, greek, text, of, the, revelation, of, saint, john, the, divine, into, music, it, was, premi, red, in, sweden, on, january, 10, 2018, knuth, s, chinese, name, is, gao, dena, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, g, o, d, n, he, was, given, this, name, in, 1977, by, frances, yao, shortly, before, making, a, three, week, trip, to, china, in, the, 1980, chinese, translation, of, volume, 1, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, pinyin, j, su, nj, ch, ngx, sh, j, y, sh, knuth, explains, that, he, embraced, his, chinese, name, because, he, wanted, to, be, known, by, the, growing, numbers, of, computer, programmers, in, china, at, the, time, in, 1989, his, chinese, name, was, placed, atop, the, journal, of, computer, science, and, technology, s, header, which, knuth, says, makes, me, feel, close, to, all, chinese, people, although, i, cannot, speak, your, language, in, 2006, knuth, was, diagnosed, with, prostate, cancer, he, underwent, surgery, in, december, that, year, and, said, a, little, bit, of, radiation, therapy, as, a, precaution, but, the, prognosis, looks, pretty, good, in, his, video, autobiography, knuth, used, to, pay, a, finder, s, fee, of, 2, 56, for, any, typographical, errors, or, mistakes, discovered, in, his, books, because, 256, pennies, is, one, hexadecimal, dollar, and, 0, 32, for, valuable, suggestions, according, to, an, article, in, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, s, technology, review, these, knuth, reward, checks, are, among, computerdom, s, most, prized, trophies, knuth, had, to, stop, sending, real, checks, in, 2008, due, to, bank, fraud, and, now, gives, each, error, finder, a, certificate, of, deposit, from, a, publicly, listed, balance, in, his, fictitious, bank, of, san, serriffe, he, once, warned, a, correspondent, beware, of, bugs, in, the, above, code, i, have, only, proved, it, correct, not, tried, it, knuth, published, his, first, scientific, article, in, a, school, magazine, in, 1957, under, the, title, the, potrzebie, system, of, weights, and, measures, in, it, he, defined, the, fundamental, unit, of, length, as, the, thickness, of, mad, no, 26, and, named, the, fundamental, unit, of, force, whatmeworry, mad, published, the, article, in, issue, no, 33, june, 1957, to, demonstrate, the, concept, of, recursion, knuth, intentionally, referred, circular, definition, and, definition, circular, to, each, other, in, the, index, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, volume, 1, the, preface, of, concrete, mathematics, has, the, following, paragraph, when, dek, taught, concrete, mathematics, at, stanford, for, the, first, time, he, explained, the, somewhat, strange, title, by, saying, that, it, was, his, attempt, to, teach, a, math, course, that, was, hard, instead, of, soft, he, announced, that, contrary, to, the, expectations, of, his, colleagues, he, was, not, going, to, teach, the, theory, of, aggregates, nor, stone, s, embedding, theorem, nor, even, the, stone, ech, compactification, several, students, from, the, civil, engineering, department, got, up, and, quietly, left, the, room, at, the, tug, 2010, conference, knuth, announced, a, satirical, xml, based, successor, to, tex, titled, itex, pronounced, performed, with, a, bell, ringing, which, would, support, features, such, as, arbitrarily, scaled, irrational, units, 3d, printing, input, from, seismographs, and, heart, monitors, animation, and, stereophonic, sound, in, 1971, knuth, received, the, first, acm, grace, murray, hopper, award, he, has, received, various, other, awards, including, the, turing, award, the, national, medal, of, science, the, john, von, neumann, medal, and, the, kyoto, prize, knuth, was, elected, a, distinguished, fellow, of, the, british, computer, society, dfbcs, in, 1980, in, recognition, of, his, contributions, to, the, field, of, computer, science, in, 1990, he, was, awarded, the, one, of, a, kind, academic, title, professor, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, the, title, has, since, been, revised, to, professor, emeritus, of, the, art, of, computer, programming, knuth, was, elected, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1975, he, was, also, elected, a, member, of, the, national, academy, of, engineering, in, 1981, for, organizing, vast, subject, areas, of, computer, science, so, that, they, are, accessible, to, all, segments, of, the, computing, community, in, 1992, he, became, an, associate, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, also, that, year, he, retired, from, regular, research, and, teaching, at, stanford, university, in, order, to, finish, the, art, of, computer, programming, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 2003, knuth, was, elected, as, a, fellow, first, class, of, fellows, of, the, society, for, industrial, and, applied, mathematics, in, 2009, for, his, outstanding, contributions, to, mathematics, he, is, a, member, of, the, norwegian, academy, of, science, and, letters, in, 2012, he, became, a, fellow, of, the, american, mathematical, society, and, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, other, awards, and, honors, include, a, short, list, of, his,
