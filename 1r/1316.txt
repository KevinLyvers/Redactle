in, early, 1958, these, would, be, organised, around, ten, constituencies, each, electing, three, members, of, the, council, one, indigenous, african, one, european, and, one, south, asian, this, would, end, the, concentration, of, political, representation, entirely, with, the, european, minority, but, still, meant, that, the, three, ethnic, blocs, would, receive, equal, representation, despite, the, fact, that, indigenous, africans, made, up, over, 98, of, the, country, s, population, for, this, reason, most, of, tanu, s, leadership, believed, that, it, should, boycott, the, election, nyerere, disagreed, in, his, view, tanu, should, participate, and, seek, to, secure, the, majority, of, the, indigenous, african, representatives, to, advance, their, political, leverage, if, they, abstained, he, argued, the, utp, would, win, the, elections, tanu, would, be, forced, to, operate, entirely, outside, of, government, and, it, would, delay, the, process, of, attaining, independence, at, a, january, 1958, conference, in, tabora, nyerere, convinced, tanu, to, take, part, in, these, elections, which, took, place, over, the, course, of, 1958, and, 1959, tanu, won,

for, the, formation, of, an, east, african, federation, he, suggested, that, tanganyika, could, delay, its, attainment, of, independence, from, the, british, empire, until, neighbouring, kenya, and, uganda, were, able, to, do, the, same, in, his, view, it, would, be, much, easier, for, the, three, countries, to, unite, at, the, same, point, as, independence, than, after, it, for, beyond, that, point, their, respective, governments, might, feel, that, they, were, losing, sovereignty, through, unification, many, senior, tanu, members, opposed, the, idea, of, delaying, tanganyikan, independence, the, party, had, been, growing, and, as, of, 1960, had, over, a, million, members, in, the, august, 1960, general, election, tanu, won, 70, of, the, 71, available, seats, as, tanu, s,

tanganyika, would, retain, the, british, queen, elizabeth, ii, as, its, head, of, state, for, a, year, before, becoming, a, republic, in, may, tanganyika, achieved, self, governance, one, of, nyerere, s, first, acts, as, prime, minister, was, to, stop, the, supply, of, tanganyikan, labourers, to, south, african, gold, mines, although, this, resulted, in, a, loss, of, around, 500, 000, a, year, for, tanganyika, nyerere, regarded, it, as, a, necessary, act, in, expressing, opposition, to, the, apartheid, system, of, white, minority, rule, and, racial, segregation, implemented, in, south, africa, on, 9, december, 1961, tanganyika, gained, independence, an, event, marked, by, a, ceremony, at, national, stadium, a, law, was, soon, presented, to, the, assembly, that, would, restrict, citizenship, to, indigenous, africans, nyerere, spoke, out, against, the, bill, comparing, its, racialism, to, the, ideas, of, adolf, hitler, and, hendrik, verwoerd, and, threatened, to, resign, if, it, passed,

the, country, was, created, to, encourage, young, people, to, engage, in, public, works, and, paramilitary, training, in, february, 1962, the, government, announced, its, desire, to, convert, the, pervasive, system, of, freehold, land, ownership, into, a, leasehold, system, the, latter, of, which, was, deemed, to, be, a, better, reflection, of, traditional, indigenous, ideas, about, communal, land, ownership, nyerere, wrote, an, article, ujamaa, familyhood, in, which, he, explained, and, praised, this, policy, in, this, article, he, expressed, many, of, his, ideas, about, african, socialism, for, nyerere, ujamaa, could, provide, a, national, ethic, that, was, distinct, from, the, colonial, era, and, would, help, to, cement, tanganyika, s, independent, course, amid, the, cold, war, six, months, after, independence, the, government, abolished, the, jobs, and, salaries, of, hereditary, chiefs, whose, positions, conflicted, with, government, officials, and, who, were, often, regarded, as, too, close, to, the, colonial, authorities, the, government, also, pursued, the, africanization, of, the, civil, service, giving, severance, pay, to, several, hundred, white, british, civil, servants, and, appointing, indigenous, africans, in, their, place, many, of, whom, were, insufficiently, trained, nyerere, acknowledged, that, such, affirmative, action, was, discriminatory, towards, white, and, asian, citizens, but, argued, that, it, was, temporarily, necessary, to, redress, the, imbalance, caused, by, colonialism, by, the, end, of, 1963, about, half, of, senior, and, middle, grade, posts, in, the, civil, service, were, held, by, indigenous, africans, you, go, through, two, stages, in, these, colonial, countries, one, is, when, midnight, comes, the, clock, strikes, and, you, are, independent, fine, but, then, begins, a, whole, process, of, changing, conditions, and, changing, people, i, had, been, talking, to, the, people, telling, them, that, the, second, process, would, not, be, easy, but, one, thing, must, change, after, midnight, the, attitudes, of, the, colonial, people, their, way, of, treating, africans, as, nothing, this, must, change, after, midnight, the, colonized, are, now, the, rulers, and, the, man, in, the, street, must, see, this, if, they, have, been, spitting, in, his, face, now, it, must, stop, after, midnight, this, cannot, take, twenty, years, we, had, to, drive, this, lesson, home, julius, nyerere, on, the, deportation, of, white, british, individuals, accused, of, racism, over, the, following, year, several, britons, accused, of, racism, were, deported, concerns, were, raised, about, the, lack, of, due, process, nyerere, defended, the, deportations, stating, for, many, years, we, africans, have, suffered, humiliations, in, our, own, country, we, are, not, going, to, suffer, them, now, after, the, safari, hotel, in, arusha, was, accused, of, insulting, guinean, president, ahmed, s, kou, tour, on, the, latter, s, june, 1963, state, visit, the, government, closed, it, when, the, white, dominated, dar, es, salaam, club, refused, admission, to, 69, tanu, members, the, government, dissolved, the, club, and, appropriated, its, assets, nyerere, avoided, becoming, personally, embroiled, in, these, controversies, which, brought, accusations, of, government, hypersensitivity, from, some, foreign, media, opposition, to, tanu, s, rule, formalised, into, two, small, political, parties, the, senior, trade, unionist, christopher, s, k, tumbo, founded, the, people, s, democratic, party, while, zuberi, mtemvu, formed, the, african, national, congress, which, wanted, a, more, racialist, anti, colonial, stance, the, government, thought, itself, vulnerable, and, in, 1962, introduced, a, law, banning, workers, strikes, and, the, preventative, detention, law, through, which, it, could, detain, without, trial, individuals, deemed, a, threat, to, national, security, nyerere, defended, this, measure, pointing, to, similar, laws, in, the, united, kingdom, and, india, and, stating, that, the, government, needed, it, as, a, safeguard, given, the, weak, state, of, both, the, police, and, army, he, expressed, the, hope, that, the, government, would, never, have, to, use, it, and, noted, that, they, were, aware, how, it, could, be, a, convenient, tool, in, the, hands, of, an, unscrupulous, government, the, government, drew, up, plans, to, create, a, new, constitution, which, would, convert, tanganyika, from, a, monarchy, with, the, queen, of, tanganyika, as, its, head, of, state, into, a, republic, with, an, elected, president, as, head, of, state, this, president, would, be, elected, by, the, population, and, they, would, then, appoint, a, vice, president, who, would, preside, over, the, national, assembly, tanganyika, s, parliament, biographer, william, edgett, smith, later, noted, that, it, was, a, foregone, conclusion, that, nyerere, would, be, selected, as, tanu, s, candidate, for, president, in, the, november, presidential, election, he, secured, 98, 1, of, the, vote, defeating, mtemvu, after, the, election, nyerere, announced, that, tanu, s, national, executive, committee, had, voted, to, ask, the, party, s, national, conference, to, widen, membership, to, all, tanganyikans, during, the, anti, colonial, struggle, only, indigenous, africans, had, been, permitted, to, join, but, nyerere, now, stated, that, it, should, welcome, white, and, asian, members, he, also, stipulated, that, complete, political, amnesty, should, be, granted, to, anyone, expelled, from, the, party, since, 1954, allowing, them, to, rejoin, in, early, 1963, amir, jamal, an, asian, tanganyikan, became, the, party, s, first, non, indigenous, member, the, white, derek, bryceson, became, its, second, nyerere, welcomed, asians, and, europeans, into, the, cabinet, to, counter, potential, racial, resentment, from, these, minorities, nyerere, saw, it, as, importance, to, build, a, national, consciousness, that, transcended, ethnic, and, religious, lines, on, 9, december, 1962, a, year, after, independence, tanganyika, became, a, republic, nyerere, moved, into, the, state, house, in, dar, es, salaam, the, former, official, residence, of, british, governors, nyerere, disliked, life, in, the, building, but, remained, there, until, 1966, nyerere, appointed, kawawa, his, vice, president, in, 1963, he, put, his, name, forward, to, be, rector, of, edinburgh, university, vowing, to, travel, to, scotland, whenever, needed, the, position, instead, went, to, the, actor, james, robertson, justice, he, made, official, visits, to, west, germany, the, united, states, canada, algeria, scandinavia, guinea, and, nigeria, in, the, u, s, he, met, president, john, f, kennedy, and, although, they, personally, liked, each, other, he, failed, to, convince, kennedy, to, toughen, his, stance, on, apartheid, south, africa, the, early, years, of, nyerere, s, presidency, were, preoccupied, largely, by, african, affairs, in, february, 1963, he, attended, the, afro, asian, solidarity, conference, in, moshi, where, he, cited, the, recent, congolese, situation, as, an, example, of, the, neo, colonialism, describing, it, as, part, of, a, second, scramble, for, africa, in, may, he, attended, the, founding, session, of, the, organisation, for, african, unity, oau, at, addis, ababa, in, ethiopia, there, echoing, his, previous, message, stating, that, the, real, humiliating, truth, is, that, africa, is, not, free, and, therefore, it, is, africa, which, should, take, the, necessary, collective, measures, to, free, africa, he, hosted, the, oau, s, liberation, committee, in, dar, es, salaam, and, provided, weapons, and, support, to, anti, colonial, movements, active, in, southern, africa, nyerere, endorsed, the, pan, africanist, idea, of, unifying, africa, as, a, single, state, although, he, disagreed, with, the, ghanaian, president, kwame, nkrumah, s, view, that, this, could, be, achieved, quickly, instead, nyerere, stressed, the, idea, of, forming, regional, confederations, as, short, term, steps, towards, the, eventual, unification, of, the, continent, pursuing, these, ideals, in, june, 1963, nyerere, met, with, kenyan, president, jomo, kenyatta, and, ugandan, president, milton, obote, in, nairobi, where, they, agreed, to, unite, their, respective, countries, into, a, single, east, african, federation, by, the, end, of, the, year, this, however, never, materialised, in, december, 1963, nyerere, lamented, that, this, failure, was, the, major, disappointment, of, the, year, instead, the, east, african, community, was, launched, in, 1967, to, facilitate, some, cooperation, between, the, three, countries, later, nyerere, saw, his, inability, to, establish, an, east, african, federation, as, the, biggest, failure, of, his, career, nyerere, was, concerned, by, developments, in, zanzibar, a, pair, of, islands, off, of, tanganyika, s, coast, he, noted, that, it, was, very, vulnerable, to, outside, influences, which, could, in, turn, impact, tanganyika, nyerere, was, keen, to, keep, cold, war, conflicts, between, the, u, s, and, soviet, union, out, of, eastern, africa, zanzibar, secured, independence, from, the, british, empire, in, 1963, and, in, january, 1964, the, zanzibar, revolution, took, place, in, which, the, arab, sultan, jamshid, bin, abdullah, was, overthrown, and, replaced, by, a, government, consisting, largely, of, indigenous, africans, nyerere, was, taken, by, surprise, by, the, revolution, like, kenya, and, uganda, he, quickly, recognised, the, new, government, although, allowed, the, deposed, sultan, to, land, in, tanganyika, and, from, there, fly, to, london, at, the, request, of, the, new, zanzibar, government, he, sent, 300, policemen, to, the, island, to, help, restore, order, in, january, 1964, nyerere, ended, affirmative, action, hiring, for, the, civil, service, believing, the, colonial, imbalance, to, have, been, redressed, he, stated, it, would, be, wrong, for, us, to, continue, to, distinguish, between, tanganyikan, citizens, on, any, grounds, other, than, those, of, character, and, ability, to, do, specific, tasks, many, trade, unionists, denounced, the, discontinuation, of, the, policy, and, it, proved, the, catalyst, for, an, army, mutiny, on, 20, january, a, small, group, of, soldiers, in, the, first, battalion, calling, themselves, the, army, night, freedom, fighters, launched, an, uprising, demanding, the, dismissal, of, their, white, officers, and, a, pay, rise, the, mutineers, left, the, colito, barracks, and, entered, dar, es, salaam, where, they, seized, the, state, house, nyerere, narrowly, escaped, hiding, in, a, roman, catholic, mission, for, two, days, the, mutineers, captured, senior, government, figure, oscar, kambona, forcing, him, to, dismiss, all, white, officers, and, appoint, the, indigenous, elisha, kavana, as, head, of, the, tanganyika, rifles, the, second, battalion, based, in, tabora, also, mutineed, with, kambona, acceding, to, their, demands, to, appoint, the, indigenous, mrisho, sarakikya, as, their, battalion, leader, having, agreed, to, many, of, their, demands, kambona, convinced, the, first, battalion, mutineers, to, return, to, their, barracks, similar, yet, smaller, mutinies, broke, out, in, kenya, and, uganda, with, the, governments, of, both, calling, for, british, military, assistance, in, suppressing, the, uprisings, the, whole, week, has, been, one, of, most, grievous, shame, for, our, nation, it, will, take, months, and, even, years, to, erase, from, the, mind, of, the, world, what, it, has, heard, about, these, events, this, week, julius, nyerere, on, the, army, mutiny, on, 22, january, nyerere, came, out, of, hiding, the, next, day, he, gave, a, press, conference, stating, that, tanganyika, s, reputation, had, been, damaged, by, the, mutiny, and, that, he, would, not, call, for, military, assistance, from, the, uk, two, days, later, he, requested, british, military, assistance, which, was, granted, on, 25, january, 60, british, royal, marines, were, helicoptered, into, the, city, where, they, landed, next, to, the, colito, barracks, the, mutineers, soon, surrendered, in, the, wake, of, the, mutiny, nyerere, disbanded, the, first, battalion, and, dismissed, hundreds, of, soldiers, from, the, second, battalion, concerned, about, dissent, more, broadly, he, discharged, about, ten, percent, of, the, 5000, strong, police, force, and, oversaw, the, arrest, of, around, 550, people, under, the, preventative, detention, act, although, most, were, swiftly, released, he, denounced, the, ringleaders, of, the, mutiny, for, trying, to, intimidate, our, nation, at, the, point, of, a, gun, and, fourteen, of, them, were, given, sentences, of, between, five, and, fifteen, years, imprisonment, as, the, british, marines, left, he, brought, in, the, nigerian, army, s, third, battalion, to, keep, order, nyerere, attributed, the, mutiny, to, the, fact, that, his, government, had, failed, to, do, enough, to, change, the, army, since, colonial, times, we, changed, the, uniforms, a, bit, we, commissioned, a, few, africans, but, at, the, top, they, were, still, solidly, british, you, could, never, consider, it, an, army, of, the, people, acknowledging, some, of, the, mutineers, demands, he, appointed, sarakikya, as, the, new, commander, of, the, army, and, raised, troop, wages, after, the, mutiny, nyerere, s, government, became, increasingly, focused, on, security, placing, tanu, personnel, into, the, army, as, well, as, state, owned, industry, to, entrench, party, control, throughout, the, country, following, the, zanzibari, revolution, abeid, karume, declared, himself, president, of, a, one, party, state, and, began, redistributing, arab, owned, land, among, black, african, peasants, hundreds, of, arabs, and, indians, left, as, did, most, of, the, island, s, british, community, western, powers, were, reluctant, to, recognise, karume, s, government, whereas, the, soviet, union, eastern, bloc, and, people, s, republic, of, china, quickly, did, so, and, offered, the, country, aid, nyerere, was, angry, at, this, western, response, as, well, as, the, wider, western, failure, to, appreciate, why, black, zanzibaris, had, revolted, in, the, first, place, in, april, he, visited, karume, the, following, day, they, announced, the, political, unification, of, tanganyika, and, zanzibar, nyerere, dismissed, suggestions, that, this, had, anything, to, do, with, cold, war, power, struggles, presenting, it, as, a, response, to, pan, africanist, ideology, unity, in, our, continent, does, not, have, to, come, via, moscow, or, washington, later, biographer, william, edgett, smith, however, suggested, that, a, key, reason, for, nyerere, s, desire, for, unification, was, to, prevent, zanzibar, falling, into, a, cold, war, proxy, conflict, akin, to, those, then, raging, in, congo, and, vietnam, an, interim, constitution, for, the, united, republic, of, tanganyika, and, zanzibar, presented, nyerere, as, the, country, s, president, with, karume, as, its, first, vice, president, and, rashidi, kawawa, as, its, second, vice, president, in, august, the, government, launched, a, competition, to, find, a, new, name, for, the, country, two, months, later, it, announced, that, the, winning, proposal, was, united, republic, of, tanzania, there, was, no, immediate, change, to, the, structure, of, the, zanzibari, government, karume, and, his, revolutionary, council, remained, in, charge, and, there, was, no, merging, of, tanu, and, the, afro, shirazi, party, there, would, be, no, local, or, parliamentary, elections, on, the, island, for, many, years, zanzibaris, made, up, only, 350, 000, out, of, tanzania, s, total, population, of, 13, million, although, from, 1967, they, were, given, seven, of, the, 22, cabinet, positions, and, directly, appointed, 40, of, the, country, s, 183, members, of, parliament, nyerere, explained, this, disproportionately, high, representation, by, stressing, the, need, for, sensitivity, to, the, islanders, national, pride, in, 1965, he, stated, that, the, zanzibaris, are, a, proud, people, no, one, has, ever, intended, that, they, should, become, simply, the, republic, s, eighteenth, region, karume, was, erratic, and, unpredictable, he, was, a, source, of, repeated, embarrassment, to, nyerere, who, tolerated, him, for, the, sake, of, tanzanian, unity, in, one, instance, in, august, 1969, zanzibari, authorities, arrested, 14, men, whom, they, accused, of, plotting, a, coup, mainland, authorities, had, assisted, in, the, arrests, but, contrary, to, nyerere, s, intentions, the, arrested, men, were, tried, in, secret, and, four, of, them, secretly, executed, nyerere, was, further, embarrassed, by, the, habit, of, karume, and, other, zanzibari, revolutionary, council, members, for, pressuring, arab, girls, into, marriage, and, then, arresting, their, relatives, to, ensure, compliance, as, a, result, of, rising, international, prices, in, cloves, karume, amassed, 30, million, in, foreign, exchange, reserves, which, he, kept, from, the, central, tanzanian, government, in, april, 1972, karume, was, assassinated, by, four, gunmen, in, the, september, 1965, general, election, a, presidential, vote, took, place, across, tanzania, although, parliamentary, elections, occurred, only, on, the, mainland, and, not, on, zanzibar, although, the, one, party, state, meant, that, only, tanu, candidates, could, stand, the, party, s, national, executive, selected, multiple, candidates, for, all, but, six, seats, providing, some, democratic, choice, for, voters, two, ministers, six, junior, ministers, and, nine, backbenchers, lost, their, seats, and, were, replaced, both, derek, bryceson, and, amur, jamal, the, two, non, indigenous, cabinet, members, were, re, elected, over, black, opponents, nyerere, stood, unopposed, in, the, presidential, election, although, the, ballot, allowed, space, to, vote, against, his, candidacy, ultimately, he, secured, nearly, 97, support, tanzania, experienced, rapid, population, growth, the, december, 1967, census, revealed, a, 35, population, increase, since, 1957, this, rising, number, of, children, made, the, government, s, desire, for, universal, primary, education, more, difficult, to, achieve, observing, that, a, small, sector, of, the, population, were, able, to, attain, a, high, level, of, education, he, grew, concerned, that, they, would, form, an, elitist, group, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, people, in, 1964, he, stated, that, some, of, our, citizens, still, have, large, amounts, of, money, spent, on, their, education, while, others, have, none, those, who, receive, that, privilege, therefore, have, a, duty, to, repay, the, sacrifice, which, others, have, made, in, 1965, it, was, made, mandatory, for, all, secondary, school, graduates, to, perform, two, years, of, service, in, the, jkt, in, october, 1966, around, 400, university, students, marched, to, state, house, to, protest, this, nyerere, spoke, to, the, crowd, in, defence, of, the, measure, and, agreed, to, reduce, government, salaries, including, his, own, that, year, nyerere, ceased, using, state, house, as, his, permanent, residence, moving, into, a, newly, built, private, home, on, the, seafront, at, msasani, although, western, powers, urged, nyerere, not, to, accept, support, from,

the, congolese, government, of, moise, tshombe, which, nyerere, like, many, african, nationalists, despised, explaining, this, antipathy, to, tshombe, he, said, try, to, imagine, a, jew, who, recruits, ex, nazis, to, go, to, israel, and, assist, him, in, his, power, struggle, how, would, the, jews, take, it, relations, with, the, u, s, reached, their, worst, point, in, january, 1965, when, nyerere, expelled, two, members, of, the, u, s, embassy, for, subversive, activities, evidence, was, not, publicly, produced, to, demonstrate, their, guilt, the, u, s, responded, by, expelling, a,

this, declaration, affirmed, the, government, s, commitment, to, building, a, democratic, socialist, state, and, stressed, the, development, of, an, ethos, of, self, reliance, in, nyerere, s, view, true, independence, was, not, possible, while, the, country, remained, dependent, on, gifts, and, loans, from, other, nations, it, stipulated, that, renewed, emphasis, should, be, placed, on, developing, the, peasant, agricultural, economy, to, ensure, greater, self, sufficiency, even, if, this, meant, slower, economic, growth, after, this, point, the, concept, of, socialism, became, central, to, the, government, s, policy, formation, to, promote, the, arusha, declaration, groups, of, tanu, supporters, marched, through, the, countryside, to, raise, awareness, in, october, nyerere, accompanied, one, such, eight, day, march, which, covered, 138, miles, in, his, native, mara, district, the, day, after, the, declaration, the, government, announced, the, nationalisation, of, all, tanzanian, banks, with, compensation, provided, to, their, owners, over, the, following, days, it, announced, plans, to, nationalise, various, insurance, companies, import, export, firms, mills, and, sisal, estates, as, well, as, the, purchase, of, majority, interest, in, seven, other, firms, including, those, producing, cement, cigarettes, beer, and, shoes, some, foreign, specialists, were, employed, to, run, these, nationalised, industries, until, sufficient, numbers, of, tanzanians, had, been, trained, to, take, over, the, country, s, civil, service, nevertheless, had, little, experience, with, economic, planning, and, eventually, foreign, companies, had, to, be, brought, in, to, administer, several, nationalised, industries, a, year, after, these, initial, nationalisations, nyerere, praised, the, tanzanian, asians, for, their, role, in, ensuring, the, successful, running, of, the, nationalised, banks, stating, these, people, deserve, the, gratitude, of, our, country, nyerere, followed, his, declaration, with, a, series, of, additional, policy, papers, covering, such, areas, as, foreign, policy, and, rural, development, education, for, self, reliance, stressed, that, schools, should, place, a, new, emphasis, on, teaching, agricultural, skills, another, socialism, and, rural, development, outlined, a, three, step, process, for, creating, ujamaa, co, operative, villages, the, first, step, was, to, convince, farmers, to, move, into, a, single, village, with, their, crops, planted, nearby, the, second, was, to, establish, communal, plots, where, these, farmers, would, experiment, working, collectively, the, third, was, to, establish, a, communal, farm, nyerere, had, been, inspired, by, the, example, of, the, ruvuma, development, association, rda, an, agricultural, commune, formed, in, 1962, and, believed, its, example, could, be, followed, throughout, tanzania, by, the, end, of, 1970, there, were, reportedly, a, thousand, villages, in, tanzania, referring, to, themselves, as, ujamaa, the, peasants, brought, into, these, new, villages, often, lacked, the, self, reliant, enthusiasm, of, the, rda, members, despite, nyerere, s, hopes, villagization, rarely, improved, agricultural, production, the, arusha, declaration, was, a, turning, point, in, tanzanian, history, and, a, widely, influential, speech, in, africa, the, speech, defined, the, terms, of, political, debate, in, tanzania, and, was, initially, widely, popular, in, the, country, but, there, were, also, voices, of, dissent, historian, paul, bjerk, the, arusha, declaration, announced, the, introduction, of, a, code, of, conduct, for, tanu, and, government, leaders, to, adhere, to, this, forbade, them, from, owning, shares, or, holding, directorates, in, private, companies, receiving, more, than, one, salary, or, owning, any, houses, that, they, rented, to, others, nyerere, saw, this, as, necessary, to, stem, the, growth, of, corruption, in, tanzania, he, was, aware, of, how, this, problem, had, become, endemic, in, some, african, countries, like, nigeria, and, ghana, and, regarded, it, as, a, threat, to, his, vision, of, african, freedom, to, ensure, his, own, compliance, with, these, measures, nyerere, sold, his, house, in, magomeni, and, his, wife, donated, her, poultry, farm, in, mji, mwema, to, the, local, co, operative, village, in, 1969, nyerere, sponsored, a, bill, to, provide, gratuities, for, ministers, and, regional, and, area, commissioners, which, could, be, used, as, a, retirement, income, for, them, the, tanzanian, parliament, did, not, pass, the, bill, into, law, the, first, time, that, it, had, rejected, legislation, backed, by, nyerere, the, majority, of, parliamentarians, argued, that, its, granting, of, additional, funds, to, said, officials, broke, the, spirit, of, the, arusha, declaration, nyerere, decided, not, to, push, the, issue, conceding, that, parliament, had, valid, concerns, although, the, arusha, declaration, was, domestically, popular, some, politicians, spoke, against, it, in, october, 1969, a, group, of, army, officers, and, former, politicians, including, former, head, of, the, national, women, s, organisation, bibi, titi, mohammad, and, former, labour, minister, michael, kamaliza, were, arrested, accused, of, plotting, to, kill, nyerere, and, overthrow, the, government,

to, encourage, new, leadership, although, at, the, same, time, had, a, desire, to, remain, in, place, to, oversee, the, implementation, of, his, ideas, in, the, 1970, election, nyerere, again, stood, unopposed, securing, 97, support, for, him, to, serve, another, five, year, term, again, parliamentary, elections, took, place, on, the, mainland, but, not, in, zanzibar, in, the, early, 1970s, nyerere, s, government, accelerated, the, villagization, process, they, hoped, that, doing, so, would, improve, agricultural, productivity, allowing, the, country, to, export, more, and, thus, funding, the, development, of, light, industry, so, that, tanzania, would, be, able, to, produce, more, consumer, goods, and, rely, less, on, imports, increasingly, farmers, who, refused, to, join, the, communal, villages, were, regarded, as, opponents, of, tanu, police, began, to, round, up, farmers, and, forced, them, to, move, into, the, villages, 13, million, people, were, eventually, registered, to, 7000, villages, as, a, result, rural, production, was, severely, disrupted, according, to, a, 1978, government, survey, none, of, the, villages, had, achieved, the, official, targets, for, agricultural, productivity, many, villages, were, left, reliant, on, famine, relief, in, contrast, to, the, government, s, intentions, food, imports, rose, dramatically, and, inflation, accelerated, overall, import, levels, tripled, during, the, 1970s, while, exports, only, doubled, the, entire, process, also, damaged, nyerere, s, reputation, with, the, rural, population, the, villagization, process, had, greater, success, in, ensuring, wider, public, access, to, social, services, nyerere, s, government, pursued, the, rapid, expansion, of, healthcare, during, the, 1970s, the, number, of, health, centres, more, than, doubled, reaching, 239, while, the, number, of, rural, dispensaries, nearby, doubled, reaching, 2, 600, education, was, also, expanded, and, by, 1978, 80, of, tanzania, s, children, were, in, school, by, 1980, tanzania, was, one, of, the, few, african, countries, that, had, almost, eliminated, illiteracy, throughout, the, 1970s, bribery, and, embezzlement, also, became, increasingly, common, in, tanzania, a, parliamentary, enquiry, found, that, government, losses, from, theft, and, corruption, rose, from, 10, million, shillings, in, 1975, to, nearly, 70, million, shillings, in, 1977, in, early, 1971, the, national, assembly, passed, a, measure, authorising, the, nationalisation, of, all, commercial, buildings, apartments, and, houses, worth, more, than, 100, 000, tanzanian, shillings, unless, the, owner, resided, in, them, this, measure, was, designed, to, stop, the, real, estate, profiteering, that, had, grown, across, much, of, post, independence, africa, the, measure, further, depleted, the, wealth, of, the, tanzanian, asian, community, which, had, invested, much, in, property, accumulation, in, ensuing, months, nearly, 15, 000, asians, left, the, country, various, media, outlets, began, complaining, increasingly, of, kulaks, and, parasites, fuelling, racial, tensions, around, asian, shopkeepers, many, roman, catholics, were, angered, when, the, government, nationalised, catholic, schools, and, made, them, non, denominational, nyerere, s, government, established, a, ministry, of, national, culture, and, youth, through, which, to, encourage, the, growth, of, a, distinctly, tanzanian, culture, through, organisations, it, established, such, as, radio, tanzania, dar, es, salaam, and, the, baraza, la, muzikila, taifa, music, council, the, government, exerted, considerable, control, over, the, development, of, popular, culture, in, the, country, juxtaposing, idealised, rural, lifestyles, against, urban, lifestyles, which, were, labelled, decadent, nyerere, s, government, launched, its, operation, vijana, in, october, 1968, this, targeted, forms, of, culture, considered, decadent, including, soul, music, beauty, contests, and, films, and, magazines, considered, to, be, of, an, inappropriate, nature, in, 1973, the, government, banned, most, foreign, music, from, being, played, on, national, radio, programmes, nyerere, believed, that, homosexuality, was, alien, to, africa, and, thus, tanzania, did, not, need, to, legislate, against, the, discrimination, of, homosexuals, freedom, of, speech, was, such, that, government, policy, was, criticised, within, tanu, in, parliament, and, in, the, press, however, those, regarded, as, political, subversives, were, still, detained, without, trial, often, in, poor, conditions, nyerere, rarely, initiated, such, detentions, personally, although, had, the, final, say, on, all, such, arrests, amnesty, international, estimated, that, in, 1977, there, were, a, thousand, people, detained, under, the, preventative, detention, act, although, this, had, declined, to, under, 100, by, 1981, in, june, 1976, kambona, resigned, from, the, government, ostensibly, for, health, reasons, and, relocated, to, london, he, then, claimed, to, have, been, the, victim, of, a, plot, to, overthrow, nyerere, orchestrated, by, a, group, opposed, to, the, arusha, declaration, nyerere, was, angered, by, these, statements, and, asked, kambona, to, return, it, was, revealed, that, kambona, had, taken, at, least, 100, 000, of, public, funds, with, him, to, britain, in, absentia, he, was, charged, with, treason, by, 1977, kambona, had, turned, against, nyerere, accusing, the, latter, of, being, a, dictator, over, the, following, years, various, mps, were, expelled, for, corruption, and, other, crimes, they, claimed, however, that, they, were, being, expelled, for, dissenting, from, nyerere, s, positions, by, the, mid, 1970s, there, was, much, speculation, that, nyerere, would, resign, tanu, again, nominated, him, for, the, presidency, in, 1975, but, in, his, speech, he, warned, against, repeatedly, electing, the, same, person, he, spoke, of, the, zanaki, concept, of, kung, atuka, which, meant, the, leaders, passing, on, control, to, a, younger, generation, he, also, proposed, that, having, tanu, govern, the, mainland, and, asp, govern, zanzibar, contravened, the, concept, of, a, one, party, state, and, called, for, their, merger, this, took, place, in, 1977, when, they, formed, chama, cha, mapinduzi, ccm, party, of, the, revolution, the, new, constitution, ensured, the, de, jure, nature, of, the, tanzanian, one, party, state, nyerere, began, promoting, jumbe, as, his, potential, successor, in, 1972, karume, was, assassinated, his, removal, from, power, in, zanzibar, was, a, relief, for, nyerere, karume, was, succeeded, by, aboud, jumbe, who, had, a, better, relationship, with, nyerere, in, early, 1978,

ordered, the, university, to, expel, 350, protesters, including, one, of, nyerere, s, sons, in, the, late, 1970s, several, members, of, the, military, began, organising, a, coup, although, this, was, exposed, before, it, could, occur, and, the, suspects, were, imprisoned, in, 1977, nyerere, made, his, second, state, visit, to, the, u, s, where, president, jimmy, carter, hailed, him, as, a, senior, statesman, whose, integrity, is, unquestioned, in, atlanta, nyerere, met, with, african, american, civil, rights, activist, coretta, scott, king, and, accompanied, her, to, the, grave, of, her,

foreign, policy, victory, for, nyerere, in, january, 1971, president, obote, of, uganda, was, overthrown, by, a, military, coup, led, by, idi, amin, nyerere, refused, to, recognise, the, legitimacy, of, amin, s, administration, and, offered, obote, refuge, in, tanzania, shortly, after, the, coup, nyerere, announced, the, formation, of, a, people, s, militia, a, type, of, home, guard, to, improve, tanzania, s, national, security, he, also, allowed, exiled, ugandans, to, set, up, rebel, bases, in, tanzania, in, 1971, uganda, bombed, the, kagera, saw, mill, in, tanzania, in, response, to, nyerere, s, support, for, obote, when, amin, expelled, all, 50, 000, ugandan, asians, from, his, country, in, 1972, nyerere, denounced, the, act, as, racist, one, boatload, of, ugandan, asian, refugees, attempted, to, land, in, tanzania, although, nyerere, s, government, refused, to, permit, them, concerned, that, it, would, stoke, domestic, racial, tensions, having, been, informed, of, an, alleged, plot, by, amin, to, overthrow, him, nyerere, decided, to, allow, obote, s, followers, to, launch, an, operation, to, overthrow, the, ugandan, government, in, september, 1972, obote, loyalists, invaded, uganda, from, tanzania, but, were, routed, by, amin, s, security, forces, ugandan, forces, retaliated, by, bombing, the, tanzanian, border, towns, of, bukoba, and, mwanza, nyerere, rejected, his, generals, urges, to, respond, with, force, and, agreed, to, somali, mediation, which, resulted, in, the, signing, of, a, peace, agreement, between, uganda, and, tanzania, nevertheless, relations, between, nyerere, and, amin, remained, tense, the, tanzanian, president, allowed, ugandan, rebels, to, continue, to, operate, in, tanzania, though, he, urged, them, to, keep, a, low, profile, in, 1977, the, east, african, community, that, tanzania, had, formed, with, kenya, and, uganda, formally, collapsed, in, october, 1978, uganda, invaded, tanzania, annexing, the, kagera, salient, nyerere, decided, that, tanzania, s, response, should, be, not, only, to, push, the, uganda, army, back, into, uganda, but, to, invade, the, latter, and, overthrow, amin, to, achieve, this, he, mobilized, tens, of, thousands, of, civilian, soldiers, to, aid, the, regular, army, in, january, 1979, three, tanzanian, battalions, pushed, into, uganda, and, levelled, mutukula, slaughtering, many, of, the, civilians, living, there, nyerere, was, appalled, and, ordered, measures, to, ensure, the, tanzanians, would, not, attack, civilian, targets, in, future, nyerere, also, lobbied, foreign, ambassadors, to, cut, off, supplies, of, oil, and, weapons, to, uganda, over, following, months, the, tanzanian, army, pushed, further, into, uganda, after, they, took, control, of, kampala, amin, and, many, of, his, followers, fled, into, exile, during, the, war, nyerere, had, been, planning, for, how, to, establish, a, post, amin, government, in, uganda, although, obote, retained, a, level, of, popularity, in, uganda, many, other, exiles, warned, him, not, to, restore, obote, to, the, presidency, noting, that, he, had, alienated, too, many, sectors, of, society, nyerere, accepted, this, advice, and, when, organising, a, march, 1979, conference, for, exile, groups, in, moshi, convinced, obote, not, to, attend, the, conference, decided, that, it, would, back, yusuf, lule, as, an, interim, replacement, after, amin, s, ouster, lule, was, declared, president, but, was, soon, removed, from, office, and, replaced, by, godfrey, binaisa, binaisa, too, was, only, in, power, for, a, brief, time, and, the, 1980, general, election, resulted, in, obote, once, again, becoming, leader, nyerere, withdrew, most, of, the, tanzanian, army, leaving, only, a, small, training, contingent, although, uganda, entered, a, cycle, of, civil, wars, until, 1986, the, war, cost, tanzania, approximately, us, 500, million, further, damaging, its, fragile, economy, there, were, widespread, shortages, of, consumer, goods, that, encouraged, a, growth, of, hoarding, and, smuggling, while, many, returning, soldiers, resorted, to, criminality, tanzania, s, finance, minister, edwin, mtei, entered, negotiations, with, the, international, monetary, fund, imf, and, in, early, 1979, came, to, an, agreement, that, the, country, would, receive, debt, relief, in, exchange, for, a, program, of, austerity, measures, including, parastatal, restricting, wage, freezes, raising, interest, rates, and, relaxing, import, controls, when, mtei, brought, the, deal, to, nyerere, the, latter, rejected, it, seeing, it, as, a, rejection, of, his, socialist, message, mtei, then, resigned, nyerere, viewed, the, imf, as, a, neocolonial, tool, which, imposed, policies, on, poorer, countries, that, benefitted, their, wealthier, counterparts, in, the, 1980, tanzanian, general, election, nyerere, again, stood, as, ccm, s, candidate, for, the, presidency, he, took, an, active, role, in, trying, to, find, a, successor, one, of, his, favourites, was, the, zanzibari, seif, sharif, hamad, whom, nyerere, brought, into, the, ccm, s, central, committee, his, relationship, with, jumbe, became, strained, and, he, encouraged, the, latter, to, resign, by, 1985, ali, hassan, mwinyi, a, zanzibari, muslim, had, arisen, as, the, most, prominent, candidate, as, nyerere, s, successor, and, nyerere, ultimately, agreed, to, support, his, candidature, nyerere, stood, down, as, president, with, mwinyi, replacing, him, at, the, 1985, general, election, in, doing, so, nyerere, according, to, a, b, assensoh, was, one, of, the, few, african, leaders, to, have, voluntarily, gracefully, and, honourably, bowed, out, of, governance, this, brought, him, much, respect, internationally, nyerere, remained, chair, of, ccm, until, 1990, and, from, this, position, became, a, vocal, critic, of, mwinyi, s, policies, mwinyi, wanted, to, pursue, economic, liberalisation, removing, some, of, nyerere, s, favourites, from, the, cabinets, who, opposed, his, reforms, these, reforms, led, to, inflation, and, devaluation, of, currency, destroying, the, savings, of, many, tanzanians, nyerere, saw, these, reforms, as, an, abandonment, of, his, socialist, ideals, in, july, 1987, nyerere, returned, to, the, university, of, edinburgh, to, attend, a, conference, on, the, making, of, constitutions, and, the, development, of, national, identity, where, he, gave, the, opening, address, on, post, independence, africa, he, was, invited, to, chair, an, international, committee, on, the, economic, problems, facing, the, global, south, where, he, worked, alongside, the, future, indian, prime, minister, manmohan, singh, in, august, 1990, nyerere, stepped, down, as, the, chair, of, ccm, before, stepping, down, as, ccm, chair, he, advocated, tanzania, s, transition, into, a, multi, party, democracy, he, believed, that, the, ccm, had, become, too, hidebound, and, corrupt, and, that, competition, with, other, parties, would, force, it, to, improve, his, belief, in, reform, was, influenced, by, his, observation, of, what, had, occurred, in, other, socialist, states, the, eastern, bloc, had, collapsed, mikhail, gorbachev, had, pursued, perestroika, and, glasnost, in, the, soviet, union, and, deng, xiaoping, had, overseen, economic, reform, in, china, nyerere, stated, we, cannot, remain, an, island, we, must, manage, our, own, change, don, t, wait, to, be, pushed, mwinyi, then, established, the, nyalali, commission, to, examine, the, question, of, a, transition, to, a, multi, party, system, it, concluded, that, although, most, tanzanians, wanted, to, retain, the, one, party, system, tanzania, would, benefit, from, competing, parties, rival, parties, like, chadema, the, civic, united, front, and, nccr, mageuzi, appeared, although, ccm, remained, dominant, freedom, of, speech, was, also, expanded, with, a, range, of, new, newspapers, appearing, the, nyalali, commission, had, also, recommended, a, transition, to, a, three, government, federation, with, independent, state, governments, for, both, zanzibar, and, the, mainland, in, addition, to, the, unified, federal, government, this, was, designed, to, placate, calls, for, zanzibari, autonomy, although, nyerere, opposed, it, he, argued, that, there, was, no, evidence, it, would, improve, government, and, that, it, would, waste, tax, payer, s, money, in, 1992, the, zanzibari, government, joined, the, organisation, of, the, islamic, conference, something, nyerere, criticised, arguing, that, foreign, affairs, was, a, federal, issue, and, should, not, be, delegated, to, the, zanzibari, state, in, 1993, 55, mainland, parliamentarians, called, for, the, establishment, of, a, mainland, regional, government, which, nyerere, attacked, in, a, pamphlet, the, following, year, in, 1995, he, gave, the, nyufa, speech, in, which, he, warned, of, cracks, in, the, tanzanian, state, caused, by, corruption, separatism, and, tribalism, he, expressed, concerns, about, growing, mainland, chauvinism, as, a, response, to, zanzibari, separatism, and, argued, that, it, would, develop, into, tribal, resentments, and, rivalries, these, concerns, were, influenced, by, the, recent, events, of, the, rwandan, genocide, during, which, members, of, rwanda, s, hutu, majority, had, turned, on, its, tutsi, minority, privately, he, remained, involved, in, ccm, politics, and, lobbied, to, ensure, that, benjamin, mkapa, succeeded, mwinyi, as, its, leader, he, campaigned, in, support, of, the, ccm, candidates, in, tanzania, s, 1995, presidential, election, mkapa, won, the, election, but, there, were, charges, of, electoral, fraud, in, coastal, regions, in, a, speech, at, the, ccm, general, assembly, nyerere, indicated, that, he, intended, to, pull, out, from, politics, altogether, nyerere, remained, active, in, international, affairs, attending, the, 1994, pan, african, congress, held, in, the, ugandan, city, of, kampala, in, 1997, he, gave, a, speech, marking, the, fortieth, anniversary, of, ghanaian, independence, in, which, he, expressed, renewed, support, for, pan, african, ideals, and, warning, against, a, return, to, the, tribe, across, the, continent, he, pointed, to, the, example, of, growing, european, unity, within, the, european, union, as, a, model, for, african, states, to, imitate, in, the, late, 1990s, he, also, reflected, on, his, presidency, noting, that, although, he, made, mistakes, particularly, in, prematurely, pursuing, nationalisation, he, stood, by, the, principles, of, the, arusha, declaration, after, the, 1995, elections, the, united, nations, asked, nyerere, to, step, in, as, a, mediator, to, help, end, the, burundian, civil, war, in, 1996, the, mwalimu, nyerere, foundation, was, established, though, which, the, negotiations, could, take, place, it, was, modelled, on, the, u, s, carter, center, that, year, he, oversaw, two, negotiation, sessions, between, competing, factions, in, mwanza, with, additional, sessions, in, arusha, in, 1998, and, 1999, nyerere, was, adamant, that, a, resolution, for, peace, should, arise, from, a, regional, initiative, rather, than, one, brought, forth, by, the, western, powers, he, insisted, on, a, process, of, inclusivity, with, even, the, smallest, political, groups, being, invited, to, take, part, in, the, negotiation, process, and, also, emphasised, the, construction, of, civilian, political, institutions, as, key, to, a, lasting, peace, in, burundi, the, negotiations, would, continue, until, nyerere, s, death, at, which, his, role, was, taken, on, by, former, president, of, south, africa, nelson, mandela, in, 1997, he, made, his, final, visit, to, edinburgh, delivering, the, lothian, european, lecture, and, teaching, seminars, at, the, university, s, centre, of, african, studies, the, government, and, army, contributed, funds, to, build, nyerere, a, house, in, his, home, village, it, was, finished, in, 1999, although, he, only, spent, two, weeks, there, prior, to, his, death, by, 1998, nyerere, was, aware, that, he, had, terminal, leukaemia, but, kept, this, from, the, public, in, september, 1999, he, travelled, to, england, for, medical, care, being, hospitalised, in, st, thomas, hospital, london, there, in, early, october, he, had, a, major, stroke, and, was, placed, in, intensive, care, he, died, on, 14, october, 1999, with, his, wife, and, six, of, his, children, at, his, bedside, benjamin, mkapa, tanzanian, president, at, the, time, announced, nyerere, s, death, on, national, television, and, also, proclaimed, a, 30, day, mourning, period, nyerere, was, honoured, by, tanzanian, state, radio, playing, funeral, music, while, video, footage, of, him, were, broadcast, on, television, a, requiem, mass, was, then, held, at, westminster, cathedral, on, 16, october, his, body, was, then, flown, back, to, tanzania, where, it, was, carried, past, crowds, in, dar, es, salaam, and, taken, to, his, coastal, home, there, another, requiem, mass, was, held, at, st, joseph, s, cathedral, a, funeral, was, then, held, at, the, national, stadium, in, which, hundreds, passed, by, the, body, as, it, lay, in, state, finally, the, body, was, flown, to, butiama, and, buried, nyerere, s, ideology, a, form, of, african, socialism, is, known, as, ujamaa, although, attaining, some, of, his, early, ideas, from, african, association, contemporaries, in, tanganyika, many, of, nyerere, s, political, beliefs, were, developed, while, he, was, studying, in, edinburgh, he, noted, that, he, evolved, the, whole, of, my, political, philosophy, while, i, was, there, in, the, city, he, was, influenced, by, texts, produced, within, the, traditions, of, classical, liberalism, and, fabian, socialism, as, well, as, by, his, reading, of, adam, smith, and, john, stuart, mill, both, of, whom, he, had, studied, as, a, student, for, much, of, his, life, he, was, a, prolific, writer, and, speaker, leaving, much, material, behind, espousing, his, ideology, the, political, economist, issa, g, shivji, noted, that, although, nyerere, was, a, great, man, of, principle, but, that, when, in, power, at, times, pragmatism, even, machiavellism, overshadowed, his, avowed, principles, as, a, result, shivji, argued, nyerere, exhibited, a, great, ability, and, talent, to, rationalise, his, political, actions, with, an, astute, exposition, of, principles, nyerere, was, an, african, nationalist, he, despised, colonialism, and, felt, duty, bound, to, oppose, the, colonial, state, in, tanganyika, in, campaigning, against, colonialism, nyerere, acknowledged, that, he, was, inspired, by, the, principles, behind, both, the, american, revolution, and, the, french, revolution, he, was, also, influenced, by, the, indian, independence, movement, which, successfully, resulted, in, the, creation, of, an, indian, republic, in, 1947, just, before, nyerere, studied, in, britain, nyerere, insisted, that, the, situation, in, tanganyika, was, such, that, non, violent, protest, was, possible, and, should, be, pursued, stating, i, m, non, violent, in, the, sense, of, mohandas, gandhi, i, feel, violence, is, an, evil, with, which, one, cannot, become, associated, unless, it, is, absolutely, necessary, after, becoming, leader, of, his, county, he, became, a, prominent, supporter, of, anti, colonial, movements, in, southern, africa, providing, said, groups, with, material, diplomatic, and, moral, support, although, opposing, european, colonialism, nyerere, was, not, antagonistic, towards, white, europeans, from, his, experiences, he, was, aware, that, they, were, not, all, colonialists, and, racists, prior, to, independence, he, insisted, on, a, non, racialist, front, against, colonialism, challenging, those, african, nationalists, who, wanted, to, deny, equal, rights, to, east, africa, s, european, and, asian, minorities, in, a, 1951, essay, written, in, edinburgh, he, proposed, that, we, must, build, up, a, society, in, which, we, shall, belong, to, east, africa, and, not, to, our, racial, groups, we, appeal, to, all, thinking, europeans, and, indians, to, regard, themselves, as, ordinary, citizens, of, tanganyika, we, are, all, tanganyikans, and, we, are, all, east, africans, he, argued, that, racial, equality, should, be, upheld, on, an, individual, basis, with, individuals, being, legally, protected, against, racial, discrimination, rather, than, being, enshrined, in, government, with, certain, parliamentary, seats, reserved, for, different, racial, groups, this, involvement, in, multi, racial, politics, differed, from, the, approaches, adopted, by, many, other, african, nationalists, in, tanganyika, when, in, power, nyerere, ensured, that, his, government, and, close, associates, reflected, a, cross, section, of, east, african, society, including, black, africans, indians, arabs, and, europeans, as, well, as, practitioners, of, christianity, islam, hinduism, and, african, traditional, religion, nyerere, was, also, a, pan, africanist, he, nevertheless, saw, a, tension, between, his, governance, of, a, nation, state, and, his, pan, africanist, values, referring, to, this, as, dilemma, of, the, pan, africanist, in, a, 1964, address, nyerere, emphasised, the, idea, of, democracy, as, a, principle, he, described, democracy, as, government, by, the, people, ideally, it, is, a, form, of, government, whereby, the, people, all, the, people, settle, their, affairs, through, free, discussion, this, is, a, definition, close, to, that, generated, by, the, clergyman, theodore, parker, whose, influence, he, acknowledged, it, was, also, influenced, by, forms, of, localised, decision, making, found, in, various, indigenous, african, societies, with, nyerere, stating, that, discussing, an, issue, till, everyone, agreed, was, the, very, essence, of, traditional, african, democracy, he, absorbed, the, values, of, liberal, democracy, but, focused, attention, on, how, to, africanize, democracy, he, emphasized, that, post, colonial, african, states, were, in, a, very, different, situation, to, western, countries, and, thus, required, a, different, governance, structure, specifically, he, favoured, a, representative, democratic, system, within, a, one, party, state, he, opposed, the, formation, of, different, parties, and, other, political, organisations, with, differing, objectives, in, tanzania, deeming, them, disruptive, to, his, idea, of, the, harmonious, society, and, fearing, their, ability, to, further, destabilise, the, fragile, state, he, criticised, the, de, facto, two, party, system, he, had, observed, in, britain, describing, it, as, foot, ball, politics, in, his, words, where, there, is, one, party, and, that, party, is, identified, with, the, nation, as, a, whole, the, foundations, of, democracy, are, firmer, than, they, can, ever, be, when, you, have, two, or, more, parties, each, representing, only, a, section, of, the, community, he, repeatedly, wrote, arguments, on, these, ideas, often, aimed, at, western, liberals, following, the, 1965, parliamentary, election, in, which, different, candidates, from, the, same, party, competed, for, most, seats, nyerere, noted, i, don, t, blame, westerners, for, being, sceptical, the, only, democracies, they, have, known, have, been, multi, party, systems, and, the, only, one, party, systems, they, have, seen, have, been, non, democratic, but, a, multiplicity, of, parties, does, not, guarantee, democracy, for, nyerere, it, was, the, preservation, of, political, and, civil, liberties, rather, than, the, presence, of, multiple, parties, that, ensured, democracy, he, believed, that, freedom, of, speech, was, possible, in, a, one, party, state, however, his, opposition, to, the, formation, of, competing, political, groups, led, critics, to, argue, that, there, were, anti, democratic, implications, to, his, thought, nyerere, was, keen, to, associate, himself, with, the, idea, of, freedom, titling, his, three, major, compilations, of, speeches, and, writings, freedom, and, unity, freedom, and, socialism, and, freedom, and, development, his, conception, of, freedom, was, strongly, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, german, philosopher, immanuel, kant, like, kant, nyerere, believed, that, the, purpose, of, the, state, was, to, promote, liberty, and, the, freedom, of, the, individual, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a, world, constituent, assembly, convened, to, draft, and, adopt, the, constitution, for, the, federation, of, earth, at, the, heart, and, centre, of, nyerere, s, political, values, was, an, affirmation, of, the, fundamental, equality, of, all, humankind, and, a, commitment, to, the, building, of, social, economic, and, political, institutions, which, would, reflect, and, ensure, this, equality, pratt, 2000, nyerere, was, a, socialist, with, his, views, on, socialism, intertwined, with, his, ideas, on, democracy, he, promoted, african, socialism, from, at, least, july, 1943, when, he, wrote, an, article, referring, to, the, concept, in, the, tanganyika, standard, newspaper, where, he, learned, the, term, is, not, clear, for, it, would, not, become, widely, used, until, the, 1960s, nyerere, saw, socialism, not, as, an, alien, idea, to, africa, but, as, something, that, reflected, traditional, african, lifestyles, in, his, view, a, socialist, attitude, of, mind, was, already, present, in, traditional, african, society, in, his, words, from, 1962, we, in, africa, have, no, more, need, of, being, converted, to, socialism, than, we, have, of, being, taught, democracy, both, are, rooted, in, our, past, in, the, traditional, society, which, produced, us, he, presented, the, traditional, african, village, as, well, as, the, ancient, greek, city, state, as, the, model, for, the, idealised, society, molony, described, nyerere, as, having, produced, romanticised, accounts, of, idyllic, village, life, in, traditional, society, describing, his, as, a, misty, eyed, view, of, this, african, past, nyerere, s, ideas, about, socialism, owed, little, to, either, european, social, democracy, or, marxism, he, detested, the, marxist, idea, of, class, struggle, although, he, quoted, from, karl, marx, s, capital, when, speaking, to, certain, audiences, he, was, critical, of, the, idea, of, scientific, socialism, promoted, by, marxists, like, marx, and, vladimir, lenin, he, expressed, the, view, that, marxist, ideas, about, the, construction, of, a, socialist, society, from, a, capitalist, one, through, the, efforts, of, a, revolutionary, urban, proletariat, class, were, not, applicable, to, post, colonial, africa, where, there, was, little, or, no, capitalism, or, proletariat, and, where, in, nyerere, s, view, traditional, society, was, not, stratified, into, competing, economic, classes, in, most, of, africa, nyerere, said, we, have, to, begin, our, socialism, from, tribal, communalism, and, a, colonial, legacy, which, did, not, build, much, capitalism, he, was, also, critical, of, the, utopian, socialism, promoted, by, figures, like, henri, de, saint, simon, and, robert, owen, seeing, their, ideas, as, largely, irrelevant, to, the, tanzanian, situation, in, his, view, these, european, socialist, writers, had, not, produced, ideas, suited, to, the, african, context, because, they, had, not, considered, the, history, of, colonial, domination, which, africa, had, experienced, the, only, way, to, defeat, our, present, poverty, is, to, accept, the, fact, that, it, exists, to, live, as, poor, people, and, to, spend, every, cent, that, we, have, surplus, to, our, basic, needs, on, the, things, which, will, make, us, richer, healthier, and, more, educated, in, the, future, julius, nyerere, nyerere, firmly, believed, in, egalitarianism, and, in, creating, a, society, of, equals, referring, to, his, desire, for, a, classless, society, in, his, view, the, equality, of, ujamaa, must, come, from, the, individual, s, commitment, to, a, just, society, in, which, all, talents, and, abilities, were, used, to, the, full, he, desired, a, society, in, which, the, interests, of, the, individual, and, society, were, identical, and, thought, this, could, be, achieved, because, individuals, ultimately, wanted, to, promote, the, common, good, he, believed, it, important, to, balance, the, rights, of, the, individual, with, their, duty, to, society, expressing, the, view, that, western, countries, placed, too, much, of, an, emphasis, on, individual, rights, he, regarded, what, he, saw, as, the, ensuing, self, centred, materialism, as, repulsive, to, determine, what, balance, to, strike, between, the, freedom, of, the, individual, and, their, responsibilities, to, society, he, turned, to, the, ideas, of, genevan, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, his, ideas, on, societal, collectivity, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, work, of, the, social, anthropologist, ralph, piddington, under, whom, nyerere, studied, at, edinburgh, it, was, nyerere, s, belief, that, africa, would, resolve, the, tension, between, the, individual, and, society, a, balance, which, other, continents, had, failed, to, achieve, nyerere, detested, elitism, and, sought, to, reflect, that, attitude, in, the, manner, in, which, he, conducted, himself, as, president, he, was, cautious, to, prevent, the, replacement, of, the, colonial, elite, with, an, indigenous, elite, and, to, this, end, insisted, that, the, most, educated, sectors, of, the, tanzanian, population, should, remain, fully, integrated, with, society, as, a, whole, he, criticised, the, existence, of, aristocracy, and, the, british, monarchy, he, endorsed, the, equality, of, the, sexes, stating, that, it, is, essential, that, our, women, live, on, terms, of, full, equality, with, their, fellow, citizens, who, are, men, he, remained, dedicated, to, a, belief, in, the, rule, of, law, he, stressed, the, need, for, hard, work, nyerere, appealed, to, the, idea, of, tradition, when, trying, to, convince, tanzanians, of, his, ideas, he, stated, that, tanzania, could, only, be, developed, through, the, religion, of, socialism, and, self, reliance, he, reiterated, the, ideas, of, freedom, equality, and, unity, as, being, central, to, his, concept, of, african, socialism, socialism, is, concerned, with, man, s, life, in, this, society, a, man, s, relationship, with, god, is, a, personal, matter, for, him, and, him, alone, his, beliefs, about, the, hereafter, are, his, own, affair, julius, nyerere, on, socialism, and, religion, nyerere, s, belief, in, socialism, was, retained, after, his, socialist, reforms, failed, to, generate, economic, growth, he, stated, that, they, keep, saying, you, ve, failed, but, what, is, wrong, with, urging, people, to, pull, together, did, christianity, fail, because, the, world, is, not, all, christian, much, of, nyerere, s, political, ideology, was, inspired, by, his, christian, belief, although, he, stipulated, the, view, that, one, did, not, have, to, be, a, christian, to, be, a, socialist, there, is, not, the, slightest, necessity, for, people, to, study, metaphysics, and, decide, whether, there, is, one, god, many, gods, or, no, god, before, they, can, be, socialist, what, matters, in, socialism, and, to, socialists, is, that, you, should, care, about, a, particular, kind, of, social, relationship, on, this, earth, why, you, care, is, your, own, affair, elsewhere, he, declared, that, socialism, is, secular, trevor, huddleston, thought, that, nyerere, could, be, considered, both, a, christian, humanist, and, a, christian, socialist, in, his, speeches, and, writings, nyerere, frequently, quoted, from, the, bible, and, in, a, 1970, address, to, the, headquarters, of, the, maryknoll, mission, he, argued, that, the, roman, catholic, church, must, involve, itself, in, the, rebellion, against, those, social, structures, and, economic, organizations, which, condemn, men, to, poverty, humiliation, and, degradation, warning, that, if, it, failed, to, do, so, then, it, would, lose, relevance, and, the, christian, religion, will, degenerate, into, a, series, of, superstitions, accepted, by, the, fearful, despite, his, personal, religious, commitments, he, espoused, freedom, of, religion, and, the, right, for, individuals, to, change, their, religious, adherence, those, who, knew, nyerere, in, edinburgh, recall, him, as, not, the, usual, type, a, very, decent, fellow, of, a, very, independent, turn, of, mind, a, delightful, person, a, student, with, a, clearly, evident, awareness, of, opportunity, to, learn, a, quiet, likeable, young, man, of, integrity, and, a, quiet, unassuming, person, who, drew, no, attention, to, himself, in, the, way, some, students, do, biographer, thomas, molony, smith, described, nyerere, as, a, slight, wiry, man, with, a, high, forehead, and, a, toothbrush, moustache, he, was, described, as, an, eloquent, speaker, and, a, skilled, debater, with, bjerk, describing, him, as, having, a, scholar, s, mind, according, to, molony, articulated, his, sometimes, complex, ideas, in, a, simple, and, logical, style, of, speechwriting, nyerere, was, a, modest, man, who, was, shy, regarding, the, personality, cult, that, followers, established, around, him, in, rejecting, the, personality, cult, he, for, instance, rejected, ideas, that, statues, be, built, to, him, in, a, 1963, memorandum, he, called, on, colleagues, to, help, him, in, stamping, out, the, disease, of, pomposity, in, tanzanian, society, as, president, he, for, instance, did, not, like, to, be, referred, to, as, either, your, excellency, or, dr, nyerere, most, staff, members, referred, to, him, as, mzee, a, swahili, word, meaning, old, man, smith, noted, that, nyerere, had, a, respect, for, spartan, living, and, an, abhorrence, of, luxury, in, his, later, years, he, always, travelled, by, economy, class, bjerk, described, to, nyerere, as, giving, meandering, speeches, spiced, with, barbed, humor, assessing, his, early, life, molony, described, nyerere, as, down, to, earth, principled, and, had, a, strong, sense, of, fairness, he, was, modest, and, unpretentious, in, contrast, to, a, good, number, of, his, contemporaries, at, tabora, boys, he, was, neither, arrogant, nor, conceited, in, focusing, heavily, on, his, studies, some, regarded, him, as, a, touch, precocious, or, even, as, a, swot, or, a, bore, in, addition, molony, noted, nyerere, could, be, manipulative, at, times, increasingly, shrewd, with, experience, and, always, tenacious, bjerk, noted, that, nyerere, delighted, in, wry, irony, and, wore, his, emotions, on, his, sleeve, his, joy, anger, and, sadness, often, poured, out, into, public, view, huddleston, recalled, conversations, with, nyerere, as, being, exciting, and, stimulating, with, the, tanzanian, leader, focusing, on, world, issues, rather, than, talking, about, himself, in, huddleston, s, view, nyerere, was, a, great, human, being, who, has, always, treasured, his, human, ness, his, humanity, if, you, like, more, deeply, than, his, office, for, huddleston, nyerere, displayed, much, humility, a, trait, that, was, rare, indeed, among, politicians, and, statesmen, molony, noted, that, in, edinburgh, nyerere, was, quiet, and, fairly, unremarkable, and, therefore, forgettable, an, unobtrusive, and, quietly, competitive, young, man, who, kept, his, ambitions, to, himself, nyerere, s, secretary, joseph, namata, said, that, the, leader, jokes, about, everything, and, can, shout, if, he, is, angry, when, planners, suggested, infrastructure,

corrupt, i, think, he, is, a, good, man, molony, suggested, that, there, was, a, very, shrewd, side, to, his, character, in, that, he, was, capable, of, playing, to, his, audience, by, portraying, himself, as, the, betrayed, righteous, figure, employing, melodrama, and, even, extortion, to, get, what, he, wanted, the, style, of, suit, that, nyerere, wore, was, widely, imitated, in, tanzania, which, led, to, it, being, known, as, a, tanzanian, suit, many, european, and, american, observers, believed, it, similar, to, a, mao, suit, and, interpreted, it, as, evidence, for, nyerere, s,

in, the, early, mornings, and, while, in, edinburgh, enjoyed, spending, time, sitting, quietly, in, church, there, is, some, evidence, that, while, in, scotland, he, considered, ordination, as, a,

of, people, in, tanzania, and, elsewhere, especially, in, other, parts, of, africa, but, it, is, also, a, legacy, that, has, drawn, mixed, reactions, from, many, other, people, depending, on, how, they, saw, him, as, a, leader, and, the, kind, of, policies, he, pursued, godfrey, mwakikagile, 2006, within, tanzania, nyerere, has, been, termed, the, father, of, the, nation, and, was, also, known,

mwakikagile, stated, that, it, was, nyerere, s, ideals, of, equality, and, social, justice, which, sustained, tanzania, and, earned, it, a, reputation, as, one, of, the, most, stable, and, peaceful, countries, in, africa, and, one, of, the, most, united, a, rare, feat, on, this, turbulent, continent, for, mwakikagile, nyerere, was, one, of, the, world, s, most, influential, leaders, of, the, twentieth, century, nyerere, was, remembered, in, african, nationalist, history, as, an, uncompromising, socialist, molony, stated, that, nyerere, s, contribution, to, socialism, was, to, make, it, african, and, in, his, eyes, at, least, to, bring, traditional, communal, societies, into, the, modern, world, according, to, the, historian, w, o, maloba, through, his, writing, nyerere, became, one, of, the, most, respected, contributors, to, the, expanding, literature, on, african, socialism, smith, noted, that, through, his, regular, tours, of, tanzania, nyerere, has, probably, spoken, directly, to, as, large, a, percentage, of, his, countrymen, as, any, head, of, state, on, earth, in, pratt, s, view, nyerere, had, been, a, leader, of, unquestionable, integrity, who, whatever, his, policy, errors, was, profoundly, committed, to, the, welfare, of, his, people, bjerk, characterised, him, as, being, neither, saint, nor, tyrant, nyerere, was, a, politician, who, kept, his, integrity, and, vision, in, a, harsh, and, changing, world, bjerk, added, that, nyerere, was, a, brilliant, intellectual, but, some, of, his, policies, seem, disastrously, misguided, to, us, today, bjerk, noted, that, nyerere, stabilized, his, government, and, kept, the, country, at, peace, something, not, achieved, by, most, of, tanzania, s, neighbours, richard, turnbull, the, last, british, governor, of, tanganyika, described, nyerere, as, having, a, tremendous, adherence, to, principle, and, exhibiting, rather, a, gandhian, streak, the, scholar, of, education, j, roger, carter, noted, that, nyerere, s, peaceful, withdrawal, from, the, leadership, suggests, a, leader, of, unusual, quality, and, a, national, spirit, largely, of, his, own, creation, of, some, maturity, the, russian, historian, nikolai, kosukhin, described, nyerere, as, a, leader, of, a, charismatic, type, symbolizing, the, ideals, and, expectations, of, the, people, in, this, manner, comparing, him, to, gandhi, nkrumah, sun, yat, sen, and, senghor, for, kosukhin, nyerere, was, a, recognized, standard, bearer, of, the, struggle, for, african, liberation, and, a, tireless, champion, of, the, idea, of, equitable, economic, relations, between, the, rich, north, and, the, developing, south, in, this, way, kosukhin, thought, nyerere, belongs, not, only, to, tanzania, and, africa, but, also, to, all, mankind, in, mwakikagile, s, view, nyerere, epitomized, the, best, among, the, founding, fathers, of, independence, african, states, citing, him, alongside, such, big, men, as, kenyatta, nkrumah, sekou, toure, patrice, lumumba, and, modibo, keita, bureaucrats, from, tanu, subsequently, established, a, cult, of, personality, around, nyerere, by, the, time, he, died, he, was, increasingly,

beatifying, nyerere, hoping, to, have, him, recognised, as, a, saint, a, delegation, from, the, vatican, arrived, in, tanzania, to, investigate, these, calls, in, january, 2005, although, his, ujamaa, ideals, were, largely, abandoned, by, the, governments, that, succeeded, him, the, historian, sidney, j, lemelle, argued, that, these, values, could, be, identified, in, the, later, tanzanian, hip, hop, and, rap, scene, at, his, death, western, commentators, repeatedly, claimed, that, nyerere, had, served, his, people, poorly, as, president, many, western, governments, and, economists, used, nyerere, s, tanzania, as, an, example, of, why, to, ensure, economic, growth, post, colonial, african, states, should, embrace, limited, state, regulation, and, a, market, economy, linked, in, with, the, international, capitalist, economy, bjerk, noted, that, although, nyerere, was, an, advocate, for, democracy, his, pursuit, of, a, democracy, adapted, to, east, african, society, led, to, him, forming, a, one, party, state, that, regularly, violated, democratic, values, he, thought, that, few, would, deny, that, nyerere, became, a, dictator, although, noted, that, he, maintained, his, authority, without, mass, violence, unlike, many, other, dictatorial, leaders, in, africa, in, 2007, the, politician, ismail, jussa, said, of, nyerere, he, wanted, to, preserve, power, maybe, he, did, not, kill, people, as, other, dictators, but, by, suppressing, dissent, he, was, not, different, to, any, other, dictator, shivji, disagreed, stating, that, to, be, sure, nyerere, was, not, a, dictator, although, described, the, policies, which, nyerere, enacted, as, being, authoritarian, it, is, said, that, nyerere, was, great, master, of, a, masonic, lodge, besides, his, support, to, frelimo, when, the, latter, processed, and, imprisoned, mozambican, politicians, who, were, in, opposition, to, it, and, who, were, later, killed, arises, criticism, in, mozambique, today, after, his, death, nyerere, received, far, less, attention, than, other, contemporary, african, leaders, like, kenyatta, nkrumah, and, mandela, much, of, the, literature, published, about, him, has, been, un, critical, and, hagiographic, ignoring, elements, of, his, life, that, might, not, be, considered, flattering, also, often, omitted, from, accounts, of, his, life, are, the, more, ruthless, elements, of, his, rule, especially, the, imprisonment, of, some, political, dissenters, in, 2009, his, life, was, portrayed, in, a, south, african, production, by, imruh, bakari, for, m, net, titled, the, legacy, of, julius, kambarage, nyerere, the, university, of, edinburgh, nyerere, s, alma, mater, also, honours, him, in, various, ways, ten, years, after, his, death, it, put, up, a, plaque, in, his,
