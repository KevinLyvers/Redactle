a, member, of, the, american, antiquarian, society, in, 1880, schliemann, s, first, interest, of, a, classical, nature, seems, to, have, been, the, location, of, troy, at, the, time, he, began, excavating, in, turkey, the, site, commonly, believed, to, be, troy, was, at, p, narba, a, hilltop, at, the, south, end, of, the, trojan, plain, the, site, had, been, previously, excavated, by, english, amateur, archaeologist, and, local, expert, frank, calvert, schliemann, performed, soundings, at, p, narba, but, was, disappointed, by, his, findings, it, was, calvert, who, identified, hissarlik, as, troy, and, suggested, schliemann, dig, there, on, land, owned, by, calvert, s, family, schliemann, was, at, first, skeptical, about, the, identification, of, hissarlik, with, troy, but, was, persuaded, by, calvert, in, 1870, schliemann, began, digging, a, trench, at, hissarlik, and, by, 1873, had, discovered, nine, buried, cities, schliemann, found, pure, copper, and, metal, molds, as, well, as, a, lot, of, other, metal, tools, cutlery, shields, and, vases, which, were, found, at, around, 28, to, 29, 1, 2, feet, deep, at, the, site, the, day, before, digging, was, to, stop, on, 15, june, 1873, was, the, day, he, discovered, gold, which, he, took, to, be, priam, s, treasure, trove, 36, 39, 131, 153, 163, 213, recent, research, has, confirmed, several, settlements, on, the, site, spanning, 3, 600, years, the, layer, that, schliemann, referred, to, as, the, burnt, city, and, believed, to, be, troy, is, now, thought, to, be, from, 3, 000, to, 2, 000, bce, too, early, to, be, the, location, of, the, trojan, war, as, homer, describes, it, he, later, wrote, that, he, had, seen, the, gold, glinting, in, the, dirt, and, dismissed, the, workmen, so, that, he, and, sophia, could, excavate, it, themselves, they, removed, it, in, her, shawl, however, schliemann, s, oft, repeated, story, of, the, treasure, s, being, carried, by, sophia, in, her, shawl, was, untrue, schliemann, later, admitted, fabricating, it, at, the, time, of, the, discovery, sophia, was, in, fact, with, her, family, in, athens, following, the, death, of, her, father, schliemann, smuggled, the, treasure, out, of, the, ottoman, empire, into, greece, the, ottoman, empire, sued, schliemann, in, a, greek, court, and, schliemann, was, forced, to, pay, a, 10, 000, gold, franc, indemnity,

in, 1994, the, museum, admitted, the, collection, was, in, their, possession, in, 1876, he, began, digging, at, mycenae, under, the, supervision, of, panagiotis, stamatakis, a, greek, archaeologist, attached, to, the, excavation, as, a, condition, of, schliemann, s, permit, there, he, discovered, the, shaft, graves, with, their, skeletons, and, more, regal, gold, including, the, so, called, mask, of, agamemnon, these, findings, were, published, in, mycenae, in, 1878, 57, 58, 226, 252, 385, although, he, had, received, permission, in, 1876, to, continue, excavation, schliemann, did, not, reopen, the, dig, site, at, troy, until, 1878, 1879, after, another, excavation, in, ithaca, designed, to, locate, a, site, mentioned, in, the, odyssey, emile, burnouf, and, rudolf, virchow, joined,

separated, from, his, wife, and, children, he, spent, a, month, studying, at, the, sorbonne, in, 1866, while, moving, his, assets, from, st, petersburg, to, paris, to, invest, in, real, estate, he, asked, his, wife, to, join, him, but, she, refused, schliemann, threatened, to, divorce, ekaterina, twice, before, doing, so, in, 1869, he, bought, property, and, settled, in, indianapolis, for, about, three, months, to, take, advantage, of, indiana, s, liberal, divorce, laws, although, he, obtained, the, divorce, by, lying, about, his, residency, in, the, u, s, and, his, intention, to, remain, in, the, state, he, moved, to, athens, as, soon, as, an, indiana, court, granted, him, the, divorce, and, married, again, two, months, later, a, former, teacher, and, athenian, friend, theokletos, vimpos, the, archbishop, of, mantineia, and, kynouria, helped, schliemann, find, someone, enthusiastic, about, homer, and, about, a, rebirth, of, my, beloved, greece, with, a, greek, name, and, a, soul, impassioned, for, learning, the, archbishop, suggested, the, 17, years, old, sophia, engastromenos, daughter, of, his, cousin, they, were, married, by, the, archbishop, on, 23,

travelled, to, halle, where, his, chronic, ear, infection, was, operated, upon, on, november, 13, the, doctors, deemed, the, operation, a, success, but, his, inner, ear, became, painfully, inflamed, ignoring, his, doctors, advice, he, left, the, hospital, and, travelled, to, leipzig, berlin, and, paris, from, the, last, he, planned, to, return, to, athens, in, time, for, christmas, but, his, ear, condition, became, even, worse, too, sick, to, make, the, boat, ride, from, naples, to, greece, schliemann, remained, in, naples, but, managed, to, make, a, journey, to, the, ruins, of, pompeii, on, christmas, day, 1890, he, collapsed, into, a, coma, he, died, in, a, naples, hotel, room, the, following, day, the, cause, of, death, was, cholesteatoma, his, corpse, was, then, transported, by, friends, to, the, first, cemetery, in, athens, it, was, interred, in, a, mausoleum, shaped, like, a, temple, erected, in, ancient, greek, style, designed, by, ernst, ziller, in, the, form, of, an, amphiprostyle, temple, on, top, of, a, tall, base, the, frieze, circling, the, outside, of, the, mausoleum, shows, schliemann, conducting, the, excavations, at, mycenae, and, other, sites, schliemann, s, magnificent, residence, in, the, city, centre, of, athens, the, iliou, melathron, palace, of, ilium, today, houses, the, numismatic, museum, of, athens, along, with, sir, arthur, evans, schliemann, was, a, pioneer, in, the, study, of, the, aegean, civilization, in, the, bronze, age, the, two, men, knew, of, each, other, evans, having, visited, schliemann, s, sites, schliemann, had, planned, to, excavate, at, knossos, but, died, before, fulfilling, that, dream, evans, bought, the, site, and, stepped, in, to, take, charge, of, the, project, which, was, then, still, in, its, infancy, further, excavation, of, the, troy, site, by, others, indicated, that, the, level, schliemann, named, the, troy, of, the, iliad, was, inaccurate, although, they, retain, the, names, given, by, schliemann, in, a, 1998, article, for, the, classical, world, d, f, easton, wrote, that, schliemann, was, not, very, good, at, separating, fact, from, interpretation, and, claimed, that, even, in, 1872, frank, calvert, could, see, from, the, pottery, that, troy, ii, had, to, be, hundreds, of, years, too, early, to, be, the, troy, of, the, trojan, war, a, point, finally, proven, by, the, discovery, of, mycenaean, pottery, in, troy, vi, in, 1890, king, priam, s, treasure, was, found, in, the, troy, ii, level, that, of, the, early, bronze, age, long, before, priam, s, city, of, troy, vi, or, troy, viia, in, the, prosperous, and, elaborate, mycenaean, age, moreover, the, finds, were, unique, the, elaborate, gold, artifacts, do, not, appear, to, belong, to, the, early, bronze, age, his, excavations, were, condemned, by, later, archaeologists, as, having, destroyed, the, main, layers, of, the, real, troy, kenneth, w, harl, in, the, teaching, company, s, great, ancient, civilizations, of, asia, minor, lecture, series, sarcastically, claimed, that, schliemann, s, excavations, were, carried, out, with, such, rough, methods, that, he, did, to, troy, what, the, greeks, could, not, do, in, their, times, destroying, and, levelling, down, the, entire, city, walls, to, the, ground, in, 1972, professor, william, calder, of, the, university, of, colorado, speaking, at, a, commemoration, of, schliemann, s, birthday, claimed, that, he, had, uncovered, several, possible, problems, in, schliemann, s, work, other, investigators, followed, such, as, professor, david, traill, of, the, university, of, california, a, 2004, article, of, the, national, geographic, society, called, into, question, schliemann, s, qualifications, his, motives, and, his, methods, in, northwestern, turkey, heinrich, schliemann, excavated, the, site, believed, to, be, troy, in, 1870, schliemann, was, a, german, adventurer, and, con, man, who, took, sole, credit, for, the, discovery, even, though, he, was, digging, at, the, site, called, hisarlik, at, the, behest, of, british, archaeologist, frank, calvert, eager, to, find, the, legendary, treasures, of, troy, schliemann, blasted, his, way, down, to, the, second, city, where, he, found, what, he, believed, were, the, jewels, that, once, belonged, to, helen, as, it, turns, out, the, jewels, were, a, thousand, years, older, than, the, time, described, in, homer, s, epic, a, 2005, article, presented, similar, criticisms, when, reporting, on, a, speech, by, university, of, pennsylvania, scholar, c, brian, rose, german, archaeologist, heinrich, schliemann, was, the, first, to, explore, the, mound, of, troy, in, the, 1870s, unfortunately, he, had, had, no, formal, education, in, archaeology, and, dug, an, enormous, trench, which, we, still, call, the, schliemann, trench, according, to, rose, because, in, the, process, schliemann, destroyed, a, phenomenal, amount, of, material, only, much, later, in, his, career, would, he, accept, the, fact, that, the, treasure, had, been, found, at, a, layer, one, thousand, years, removed, from, the, battle, between, the, greeks, and, trojans, and, thus, that, it, could, not, have, been, the, treasure, of, king, priam, schliemann, may, not, have, discovered, the, truth, but, the, publicity, stunt, worked, making, schliemann, and, the, site, famous, and, igniting, the, field, of, homeric, studies, in, the, late, 19th, century, during, this, period, he, was, criticized, and, ridiculed, of, claims, to, fathering, an, offspring, with, a, local, assyrian, girl, sparking, infidelity, and, adultery, which, schliemann, did, not, confirm, or, deny, schliemann, s, methods, have, been, described, as, savage, and, brutal, he, plowed, through, layers, of, soil, and, everything, in, them, without, proper, record, keeping, no, mapping, of, finds, few, descriptions, of, discoveries, his, rough, excavation, conclusory, interpretation, and, appropriation, of, artifacts, were, criticised, by, contemporary, antiquarians, among, them, spyridon, comnos, and, stephen, salisbury, iii, the, fame, of, his, discoveries, overshadowed, such, criticism, through, most, of, the, twentieth, century, such, that, carl, blegen, excused, his, recklessness, although, there, were, some, regrettable, blunders, those, criticisms, are, largely, colored, by, a, comparison, with, modern, techniques, of, digging, but, it, is, only, fair, to, remember, that, before, 1876, very, few, persons, if, anyone, yet, really, knew, how, excavations, should, properly, be, conducted, there, was, no, science, of, archaeological, investigation, and, there, was, probably, no, other, digger, who, was, better, than, schliemann, in, actual, field, work, in, 1874, schliemann, also, initiated, and, sponsored, the, removal, of, medieval, edifices, from, the, acropolis, of, athens, including, the, great, frankish, tower, despite, considerable, opposition, including, from, king, george, i, of, the, hellenes, schliemann, saw, the, project, through, the, eminent, historian, of, frankish, greece, william, miller, later, denounced, this, as, an, act, of, vandalism, unworthy, of, any, people, imbued, with, a, sense, of, the, continuity, of, history, and, pedantic, barbarism, in, his, excavations, at, troy, schliemann, found, many, swastikas, adorned, on, pottery, and, consulted, with, aryan, nationalist, mile, louis, burnouf, to, identify, the, symbol, claiming, that, the, symbol, was, connected, with, the, aryans, burnouf, adopted, and, popularised, the, swastika, as, a, symbol, of, aryan, nationalism
