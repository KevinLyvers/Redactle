sadistic, governess, ellen, mary, paraman, whose, tyranny, in, the, nursery, stimulated, his, combative, qualities, and, encouraged, the, obsessional, side, of, his, nature, paraman, used, to, beat, him, and, periodically, forced, him, to, parade, through, the, village, wearing, a, conical, hat, bearing, the, words, liar, sneak, and, coward, curzon, later, noted, no, children, well, born, and,

rice, and, edward, grey, spring, rice, contributed, alongside, john, william, mackail, to, the, composition, of, a, famous, sardonic, doggerel, about, curzon, that, was, published, as, part, of, the, balliol, masque, about, which, curzon, wrote, in, later, life, never, has, more, harm, been, done, to, one, single, individual, than, that, accursed, doggerel, has, done, to, me, it, read, when, spring, rice, was, assigned, to, the, british, embassy, to, the, united, states, in, 1894, 1895, he, was, suspected, by, curzon, of, trying, to, prevent, curzon, s, engagement, to, the, american, mary, leiter, whom, curzon, nevertheless, married, spring, rice, assumed, for, a, certainty, like, many, of, curzon, s, other, friends, that, curzon, would, inevitably, become, foreign, secretary, he, wrote, to, curzon, in, 1891, when, you, are, secretary, of, state, for, foreign, affairs, i, hope, you, will, restore, the, vanished, glory, of, england, lead, the, european, concert, decide, the, fate, of, nations, and, give, me, three, months, leave, instead, of, two, old, texts, state, that, he, spent, few, months, in, a, cottage, in, dehradun, india, though, exact, records, are, not, available, there, is, a, road, named, after, him, there, probably, near, his, erstwhile, cottage, during, his, youth, years, curzon, regularly, attended, debates, at, the, house, of, commons, curzon, became, assistant, private, secretary, to, the, marquess, of, salisbury, in, 1885, and, in, 1886, entered, parliament, as, member, for, southport, in, south, west, lancashire, his, maiden, speech, which, was, chiefly, an, attack, on, home, rule, and, irish, nationalism, was, regarded, in, much, the, same, way, as, his, oratory, at, the, oxford, union, brilliant, and, eloquent, but, also, presumptuous, and, rather, too, self, assured, subsequent, performances, in, the, commons, often, dealing, with, ireland, or, reform, of, the, house, of, lords, which, he, supported, received, similar, verdicts, he, was, under, secretary, of, state, for, india, in, 1891, 1892, and, under, secretary, of, state, for, foreign, affairs, in, 1895, 1898, in, the, meantime, curzon, had, travelled, around, the, world, russia, and, central, asia, 1888, 1889, persia, september, 1889, january, 1890, siam, french, indochina, china, korea, and, japan, 1892, and, a, daring, foray, into, afghanistan, and, the, pamirs, 1894, 1895, he, published, several, books, describing, central, and, eastern, asia, and, related, foreign, policy, issues, a, bold, and, compulsive, traveller, driven, by, orientalism, he, was, awarded, the, patron, s, medal, of, the, royal, geographical, society, for, his, exploration, of, the, source, of, the, amu, darya, oxus, his, journeys, allowed, him, to, study, the, problems, of, asia, and, their, implications, for, british, india, while, reinforcing, his, pride, in, his, nation, and, her, imperial, mission, curzon, believed, russia, to, be, the, most, likely, threat, to, british, india, britain, s, most, valuable, possession, from, the, 19th, century, through, the, early, 20th, century, in, 1879, russia, had, begun, construction, of, the, transcaspian, railway, along, the, silk, road, officially, solely, to, enforce, local, control, the, line, starts, from, the, city, of, kyzyl, su, formerly, krasnovodsk, nowadays, turkmenbashi, on, the, caspian, sea, travels, southeast, along, the, karakum, desert, through, ashgabat, continues, along, the, kopet, dagh, mountains, until, it, reaches, tejen, curzon, dedicated, an, entire, chapter, in, his, book, russia, in, central, asia, to, discussing, the, perceived, threat, to, british, control, of, india, this, railway, connected, russia, with, the, most, wealthy, and, influential, cities, in, central, asia, at, the, time, including, the, persian, khorasan, province, and, would, allow, the, rapid, deployment, of, russian, supplies, and, troops, into, the, area, curzon, also, believed, that, the, resulting, greater, economic, interdependence, between, russia, and, central, asia, would, be, damaging, to, british, interests, persia, and, the, persian, question, written, in, 1892, has, been, considered, curzon, s, magnum, opus, and, can, be, seen, as, a, sequel, to, russia, in, central, asia, curzon, was, commissioned, by, the, times, to, write, several, articles, on, the, persian, political, environment, but, while, there, he, decided, to, write, a, book, on, the, country, as, whole, this, two, volume, work, covers, persia, s, history, and, governmental, structure, as, well, as, graphics, maps, and, pictures, some, taken, by, curzon, himself, curzon, was, aided, by, general, albert, houtum, schindler, and, the, royal, geographical, society, rgs, both, of, which, helped, him, gain, access, to, material, to, which, as, a, foreigner, he, would, not, have, been, entitled, to, have, access, general, schindler, provided, curzon, with, information, regarding, persia, s, geography, and, resources, as, well, as, serving, as, an, unofficial, editor, curzon, was, appalled, by, his, government, s, apathy, towards, persia, as, a, valuable, defensive, buffer, to, india, from, russian, encroachment, years, later, curzon, would, lament, that, persia, has, alternatively, advanced, and, receded, in, the, estimation, of, british, statesmen, occupying, now, a, position, of, extravagant, prominence, anon, one, of, unmerited, obscurity, on, 22, april, 1895, curzon, married, mary, victoria, leiter, the, eldest, daughter, and, co, heiress, of, levi, leiter, an, american, millionaire, of, swiss, descent, who, co, founded, the, chicago, department, store, field, leiter, later, marshall, field, initially, he, had, just, married, her, for, her, wealth, so, he, could, save, his, estate, but, he, developed, feelings, for, her, mary, had, a, long, and, nearly, fatal, illness, near, the, end, of, summer, 1904, from, which, she, never, really, recovered, falling, ill, again, in, july, 1906, she, died, on, the, 18th, of, that, month, in, her, husband, s, arms, at, the, age, of, 36, it, was, the, greatest, personal, loss, of, his, life, she, was, buried, in, the, church, at, kedleston, where, curzon, designed, his, memorial, for, her, a, gothic, chapel, added, to, the, north, side, of, the, nave, although, he, was, neither, a, devout, nor, a, conventional, churchman, curzon, retained, a, simple, religious, faith, in, later, years, he, sometimes, said, that, he, was, not, afraid, of, death, because, it, would, enable, him, to, join, mary, in, heaven, they, had, three, daughters, during, a, firm, and, happy, marriage, mary, irene, who, inherited, her, father, s, barony, of, ravensdale, and, was, created, a, life, peer, in, her, own, right, cynthia, blanche, who, became, the, first, wife, of, the, fascist, politician, sir, oswald, mosley, and, alexandra, naldera, baba, curzon, s, youngest, daughter, she, married, edward, fruity, metcalfe, the, best, friend, best, man, and, equerry, of, edward, viii, mosley, exercised, a, strange, fascination, for, the, curzon, women, irene, had, a, brief, romance, with, him, before, either, were, married, baba, became, his, mistress, and, curzon, s, second, wife, grace, had, a, long, affair, with, him, curzon, in, 1901, had, famously, said, as, long, as, we, rule, india, we, are, the, greatest, power, in, the, world, if, we, lose, it, we, shall, drop, straightaway, to, a, third, rate, power, in, january, 1899, curzon, was, appointed, as, viceroy, of, india, he, was, created, a, baron, in, the, peerage, of, ireland, as, baron, curzon, of, kedleston, in, the, county, of, derby, on, his, appointment, the, title, was, curzon, of, kedleston, rather, than, simply, curzon, because, his, kinsmen, the, earls, howe, were, already, viscounts, and, barons, curzon, as, viceroy, he, was, ex, officio, grand, master, of, the, order, of, the, indian, empire, and, order, of, the, star, of, india, this, peerage, was, created, in, the, peerage, of, ireland, the, last, so, created, so, that, he, would, be, free, until, his, father, s, death, to, re, enter, the, house, of, commons, on, his, return, to, britain, reaching, india, shortly, after, the, suppression, of, the, frontier, risings, of, 1897, 98, he, paid, special, attention, to, the, independent, tribes, of, the, north, west, frontier, inaugurated, a, new, province, called, the, north, west, frontier, province, and, pursued, a, policy, of, forceful, control, mingled, with, conciliation, in, response, to, what, he, called, a, number, of, murderous, attacks, upon, englishmen, and, europeans, curzon, advocated, at, the, quetta, durbar, extremely, draconian, punishments, which, he, believed, would, stop, what, he, viewed, as, such, especially, abominable, crimes, in, his, own, private, correspondence, curzon, pondered, is, it, possible, under, the, law, to, flog, these, horrible, scoundrels, before, we, execute, them, supposing, we, remove, them, for, execution, to, another, and, distant, jail, could, we, flog, them, in, the, first, jail, before, removal, i, believe, that, if, we, could, postpone, the, execution, for, a, few, weeks, and, give, the, criminal, a, few, good, public, floggings, or, even, one, were, more, not, possible, it, would, act, as, a, real, deterrent, but, i, have, a, suspicion, that, british, law, does, not, smile, upon, anything, so, eminently, practical, the, only, major, armed, outbreak, on, this, frontier, during, the, period, of, his, administration, was, the, mahsud, waziri, campaign, of, 1901, in, the, context, of, the, great, game, between, the, british, and, russian, empires, for, control, of, central, asia, he, held, deep, mistrust, of, russian, intentions, this, led, him, to, encourage, british, trade, in, persia, and, he, paid, a, visit, to, the, persian, gulf, in, 1903, curzon, argued, for, an, exclusive, british, presence, in, the, gulf, a, policy, originally, proposed, by, john, malcolm, the, british, government, was, already, making, agreements, with, local, sheiks, tribal, leaders, along, the, persian, gulf, coast, to, this, end, curzon, had, convinced, his, government, to, establish, britain, as, the, unofficial, protector, of, kuwait, with, the, anglo, kuwaiti, agreement, of, 1899, the, lansdowne, declaration, in, 1903, stated, that, the, british, would, counter, any, other, european, power, s, attempt, to, establish, a, military, presence, in, the, gulf, only, four, years, later, this, position, was, abandoned, and, the, persian, gulf, declared, a, neutral, zone, in, the, anglo, russian, convention, of, 1907, prompted, in, part, by, the, high, economic, cost, of, defending, india, from, russian, advances, at, the, end, of, 1903, curzon, sent, a, british, expedition, to, tibet, under, francis, younghusband, ostensibly, to, forestall, a, russian, advance, after, bloody, conflicts, with, tibet, s, poorly, armed, defenders, the, mission, penetrated, to, lhasa, where, the, treaty, of, lhasa, was, signed, in, september, 1904, during, his, tenure, curzon, undertook, the, restoration, of, the, taj, mahal, and, expressed, satisfaction, that, he, had, done, so, curzon, was, influenced, by, hindu, philosophy, and, quoted, india, has, left, a, deeper, mark, upon, the, history, the, philosophy, and, the, religion, of, mankind, than, any, other, terrestrial, unit, in, the, universe, within, india, curzon, appointed, a, number, of, commissions, to, inquire, into, education, irrigation, police, and, other, branches, of, administration, on, whose, reports, legislation, was, based, during, his, second, term, of, office, as, viceroy, reappointed, governor, general, in, august, 1904, he, presided, over, the, 1905, partition, of, bengal, in, lion, and, the, tiger, the, rise, and, fall, of, the, british, raj, 1600, 1947, denis, judd, wrote, curzon, had, hoped, to, bind, india, permanently, to, the, raj, ironically, his, partition, of, bengal, and, the, bitter, controversy, that, followed, did, much, to, revitalize, congress, curzon, typically, had, dismissed, the, congress, in, 1900, as, tottering, to, its, fall, but, he, left, india, with, congress, more, active, and, effective, than, at, any, time, in, its, history, curzon, was, determined, to, address, the, british, maltreatment, of, indians, in, particular, he, incurred, the, displeasure, of, many, in, the, european, community, in, india, by, pressing, for, severe, punishment, for, europeans, who, had, attacked, indians, on, two, occasions, he, imposed, collective, punishment, on, british, army, units, which, had, attacked, indians, when, soldiers, of, the, west, kent, regiment, raped, a, burmese, woman, he, had, the, whole, regiment, exiled, to, aden, without, leave, he, later, imposed, similar, punishment, on, the, 9th, queen, s, royal, lancers, for, the, murder, of, an, indian, cook, mahatma, gandhi, lauded, curzon, as, the, first, viceroy, to, express, sympathy, for, indentured, indian, labourers, and, question, why, the, system, should, continue, curzon, was, especially, concerned, with, the, treatment, of, indian, emigrants, to, the, transvaal, and, natal, after, learning, about, the, realities, of, labour, conditions, for, indentured, indians, he, deemed, it, impossible, to, defend, the, system, in, its, current, state, and, committed, to, a, stance, of, reform, in, 1900, curzon, wrote, an, appeal, to, the, permanent, under, secretary, for, india, calling, for, indentured, labourers, to, be, treated, better, given, their, contribution, to, colonial, defences, although, this, did, not, prompt, immediate, change, on, 14, may, 1903, he, wrote, a, lengthy, despatch, to, the, india, office, demanding, full, discretion, to, withdraw, from, the, system, of, indentured, labour, if, they, would, not, concede, to, the, proper, treatment, of, indian, workers, he, continued, to, champion, this, cause, throughout, his, time, as, viceroy, curzon, proposed, the, partition, of, bengal, and, put, it, into, effect, on, 16, october, 1905, creating, the, new, province, of, eastern, bengal, and, assam, behind, this, incident, his, excuse, was, that, the, area, of, bengal, was, too, large, and, it, was, difficult, for, the, british, to, administer, efficiently, but, actually, his, intention, was, to, divide, bengalis, into, religious, and, territorial, grounds, to, weaken, the, growing, nationalism, in, bengal, he, said, partition, of, bengal, is, a, settled, fact, and, what, is, settled, cannot, be, unsettled, huge, protest, swadeshi, movement, was, seen, from, every, corner, of, bengal, and, on, 1911, this, so, called, settled, fact, became, unsettled, by, lord, hardinge, it, was, done, in, response, to, the, swadeshi, movement, s, riots, in, protest, against, the, policy, but, the, partition, animated, the, muslims, to, form, their, own, national, organization, along, communal, lines, curzon, took, an, active, interest, in, military, matters, and, in, 1901, he, founded, the, imperial, cadet, corps, or, icc, the, icc, was, a, corps, d, elite, designed, to, give, indian, princes, and, aristocrats, military, training, after, which, a, few, would, be, given, officer, commissions, in, the, indian, army, but, these, commissions, were, special, commissions, which, did, not, empower, their, holders, to, command, any, troops, predictably, this, was, a, major, stumbling, block, to, the, icc, s, success, as, it, caused, much, resentment, among, former, cadets, though, the, icc, closed, in, 1914, it, was, a, crucial, stage, in, the, drive, to, indianise, the, indian, army, s, officer, corps, which, was, haltingly, begun, in, 1917, military, organisation, proved, to, be, the, final, issue, faced, by, curzon, in, india, it, often, involved, petty, issues, that, had, much, to, do, with, clashes, of, personality, curzon, once, wrote, on, a, document, i, rise, from, the, perusal, of, these, papers, filled, with, the, sense, of, the, ineptitude, of, my, military, advisers, and, once, wrote, to, the, commander, in, chief, india, herbert, kitchener, 1st, earl, kitchener, advising, him, that, signing, himself, kitchener, of, khartoum, took, up, too, much, time, and, space, which, kitchener, thought, petty, curzon, simply, signed, himself, curzon, as, if, he, were, a, hereditary, peer, although, he, later, took, to, signing, himself, curzon, of, kedleston, a, difference, of, opinion, with, kitchener, regarding, the, status, of, the, military, member, of, the, viceroy, s, executive, council, who, controlled, army, supply, and, logistics, which, kitchener, wanted, under, his, own, control, led, to, a, controversy, in, which, curzon, failed, to, obtain, the, support, of, the, home, government, he, resigned, in, august, 1905, and, returned, to, england, a, major, famine, coincided, with, curzon, s, time, as, viceroy, in, which, 1, to, 4, 5, million, people, died, curzon, implemented, a, variety, of, measures, including, opening, up, famine, relief, works, that, fed, between, 3, and, 5, million, reducing, taxes, and, spending, vast, amounts, of, money, on, irrigation, works, in, late, victorian, holocausts, the, historian, mike, davis, criticised, curzon, for, cutting, back, rations, and, raising, relief, eligibility, at, the, time, curzon, stated, that, any, government, which, imperiled, the, financial, position, of, india, in, the, interests, of, prodigal, philanthropy, would, be, open, to, serious, criticism, but, any, government, which, by, indiscriminate, alms, giving, weakened, the, fibre, and, demoralized, the, self, reliance, of, the, population, would, be, guilty, of, a, public, crime, arthur, balfour, s, refusal, to, recommend, an, earldom, for, curzon, in, 1905, was, repeated, by, sir, henry, campbell, bannerman, the, liberal, prime, minister, who, formed, his, government, the, day, after, curzon, returned, to, england, in, deference, to, the, wishes, of, the, king, and, the, advice, of, his, doctors, curzon, did, not, stand, in, the, general, election, of, 1906, and, thus, found, himself, excluded, from, public, life, for, the, first, time, in, twenty, years, it, was, at, this, time, the, nadir, of, his, career, that, mary, died, after, the, death, of, lord, goschen, in, 1907, the, post, of, chancellor, of, oxford, university, fell, vacant, curzon, was, elected, as, chancellor, of, oxford, after, by, 1, 001, votes, to, 440, against, lord, rosebery, he, proved, to, be, an, active, chancellor, threw, himself, so, energetically, into, the, cause, of, university, reform, that, critics, complained, he, was, ruling, oxford, like, an, indian, province, in, 1908, curzon, was, elected, an, irish, representative, peer, and, thus, relinquished, any, idea, of, returning, to, the, house, of, commons, in, 1909, 1910, he, took, an, active, part, in, opposing, the, liberal,

appointed, commander, in, chief, of, british, forces, in, france, at, his, headquarters, in, france, haig, was, impressed, by, curzon, s, brains, and, decisiveness, and, considered, that, he, had, mellowed, since, his, days, as, viceroy, major, general, haig, had, been, inspector, general, of, cavalry, india, at, the, time, and, had, lost, his, old, pompous, ways, curzon, served, in, lloyd,

october, 1917, curzon, objected, in, vain, to, plans, to, redeploy, two, divisions, to, palestine, with, a, view, to, advancing, into, syria, and, knocking, the, ottoman, empire, out, of, the, war, altogether, curzon, s, commitment, wavered, somewhat, as, the, losses, of, the, third, battle, of, ypres, mounted, in, the, summer, of, 1917, the, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, cigs, general, william, robertson, sent, haig, a, biting, description, of, the, members, of, the, war, cabinet, who, he, said, were, all, frightened, of, lloyd, george, he, described, curzon, as, a, gasbag, during, the, crisis, of, february, 1918, curzon, was, one, of, the, few, members, of, the, government, to, support, robertson, threatening, in, vain, to, resign, if, he, were, removed, despite, his, opposition, to, women, s, suffrage, he, had, been, co, president, of, the, national, league, for, opposing, woman, suffrage, the, house, of, lords, voted, conclusively, in, its, favour, after, a, long, affair, with, the, romantic, novelist, elinor, glyn, curzon, married, the, former, grace, elvina, hinds, in, january, 1917, she, was, the, wealthy, alabama, born, widow, of, alfredo, huberto,

engagement, and, read, about, it, in, the, morning, newspapers, grace, had, three, children, from, her, first, marriage, two, sons, alfred, and, hubert, and, a, daughter, grace, lucille, alfred, and, hubert, as, curzon, s, step, sons, grew, up, within, his, influential, circle, curzon, had, three, daughters, from, his, first, marriage, but, he, and, grace, despite, fertility, related, operations, and, several, miscarriages, did, not, have, any, children, together, which, put, a, strain, on, their, marriage, letters, written, between, them, in, the, early, 1920s, imply, that, they, still, lived, together, and, remained, devoted, to, each, other, in, 1923, curzon, was, passed, over, for, the, office, of, prime, minister, partly, on, the, advice, of, arthur, balfour, who, joked, that, curzon, has, lost, the, hope, of, glory, but, he, still, possesses, the, means, of, grace, a, humorous, allusion, to, the, well, known, general, thanksgiving, prayer, of, the, church, of, england, which, thanks, god, for, the, means, of, grace, and, for, the, hope, of, glory, in, 1917, curzon, bought, bodiam, castle, in, east, sussex, a, 14th, century, building, that, had, been, gutted, during, the, english, civil, war, he, restored, it, extensively, and, then, bequeathed, it, to, the, national, trust, from, 1915, he, also, rented, montacute, house, as, a, residence, for, himself, and, elinor, glyn, curzon, did, not, have, david, lloyd, george, s, support, curzon, and, lloyd, george, had, disliked, one, another, since, the, 1911, parliament, crisis, the, prime, minister, thought, him, overly, pompous, and, self, important, and, it, was, said, that, he, used, him, as, if, he, were, using, a, rolls, royce, to, deliver, a, parcel, to, the, station, lloyd, george, said, much, later, that, winston, churchill, treated, his, ministers, in, a, way, that, lloyd, george, would, never, have, treated, his, they, were, all, men, of, substance, well, except, curzon, multiple, drafts, of, resignation, letters, written, at, this, time, were, found, upon, curzon, s, death, despite, their, antagonism, the, two, were, often, in, agreement, on, government, policy, lloyd, george, needed, the, wealth, of, knowledge, curzon, possessed, so, was, both, his, biggest, critic, and, simultaneously, his, largest, supporter, likewise, curzon, was, grateful, for, the, leeway, he, was, allowed, by, lloyd, george, when, it, came, to, handling, affairs, in, the, middle, east, other, cabinet, ministers, also, respected, his, vast, knowledge, of, central, asia, but, disliked, his, arrogance, and, often, blunt, criticism, believing, that, the, foreign, secretary, should, be, non, partisan, he, would, objectively, present, all, the, information, on, a, subject, to, the, cabinet, as, if, placing, faith, in, his, colleagues, to, reach, the, appropriate, decision, conversely, curzon, would, take, personally, and, respond, aggressively, to, any, criticism, it, has, been, suggested, that, curzon, s, defensiveness, reflected, institutional, insecurity, by, the, foreign, office, as, a, whole, during, the, 1920s, the, foreign, office, was, often, a, passive, participant, in, decisions, which, were, mainly, reactive, and, dominated, by, the, prime, minister, the, creation, of, the, job, of, colonial, secretary, the, cabinet, office, and, the, league, of, nations, added, to, the, foreign, office, s, insecurity, after, nine, months, as, acting, secretary, while, balfour, was, at, the, paris, peace, conference, curzon, was, appointed, foreign, secretary, in, october, 1919, he, gave, his, name, to, the, british, government, s, proposed, soviet, polish, boundary, the, curzon, line, of, december, 1919, although, during, the, subsequent, polish, soviet, war, poland, conquered, territory, in, the, east, after, world, war, ii, poland, was, shifted, westwards, leaving, the, border, between, poland, and, its, eastern, neighbours, today, approximately, at, the, curzon, line, curzon, was, largely, responsible, for, the, peace, day, ceremonies, on, 19, july, 1919, these, included, the, plaster, cenotaph, designed, by, the, noted, architect, sir, edwin, lutyens, for, the, allied, victory, parade, in, london, it, was, so, successful, that, it, was, reproduced, in, stone, and, still, stands, in, 1918, during, world, war, i, as, britain, occupied, mesopotamia, curzon, tried, to, convince, the, indian, government, to, reconsider, his, scheme, for, persia, to, be, a, buffer, against, russian, advances, british, and, indian, troops, were, in, persia, protecting, the, oilfields, at, abadan, and, watching, the, afghan, frontier, curzon, believed, that, british, economic, and, military, aid, sent, via, india, could, prop, up, the, persian, government, and, make, her, a, british, client, state, the, anglo, persian, agreement, of, august, 1919, was, never, ratified, and, the, british, government, rejected, the, plan, as, russia, had, the, geographical, advantage, and, the, defensive, benefits, would, not, justify, the, high, economic, cost, small, british, forces, had, twice, occupied, baku, on, the, caspian, in, 1918, while, an, entire, british, division, had, occupied, batum, on, the, black, sea, supervising, german, and, turkish, withdrawal, against, curzon, s, wishes, but, on, the, advice, of, sir, george, milne, the, commander, on, the, spot, the, cigs, sir, henry, wilson, who, wanted, to, concentrate, troops, in, britain, ireland, india, and, egypt, and, of, churchill, secretary, of, state, for, war, the, british, withdrew, from, baku, the, small, british, naval, presence, was, also, withdrawn, from, the, caspian, sea, at, the, end, of, august, 1919, leaving, only, three, battalions, at, batum, in, january, 1920, curzon, insisted, that, british, troops, remain, in, batum, against, the, wishes, of, wilson, and, the, prime, minister, in, february, while, curzon, was, on, holiday, wilson, persuaded, the, cabinet, to, allow, withdrawal, but, curzon, had, the, decision, reversed, on, his, return, although, to, curzon, s, fury, he, thought, it, abuse, of, authority, wilson, gave, milne, permission, to, withdraw, if, he, deemed, it, necessary, at, cabinet, on, 5, may, 1920, curzon, by, a, long, winded, jaw, in, wilson, s, description, argued, for, a, stay, in, batum, after, a, british, garrison, at, enzeli, on, the, persian, caspian, coast, was, taken, prisoner, by, bolshevik, forces, on, 19, may, 1920, lloyd, george, finally, insisted, on, a, withdrawal, from, batum, early, in, june, 1920, for, the, rest, of, 1920, curzon, supported, by, milner, colonial, secretary, argued, that, britain, should, retain, control, of, persia, when, wilson, asked, 15, july, 1920, to, pull, troops, out, of, persia, to, put, down, the, rebellions, in, iraq, and, ireland, lloyd, george, blocked, the, move, saying, that, curzon, would, not, stand, it, in, the, end, financial, retrenchment, forced, a, british, withdrawal, from, persia, in, the, spring, of, 1921, curzon, worked, on, several, middle, eastern, problems, he, designed, the, treaty, of, s, vres, august, 10, 1920, between, the, victorious, allies, and, the, ottoman, empire, the, treaty, obliged, turkey, to, renounce, all, rights, over, arab, asia, and, north, africa, but, a, new, government, in, turkey, under, kemal, atat, rk, rejected, the, treaty, the, greeks, invaded, turkey, curzon, tried, and, failed, to, induce, the, greeks, to, accept, a, compromise, on, the, status, of, smyrna, and, failed, to, force, the, turks, to, renounce, their, nationalist, program, lloyd, george, tried, to, use, force, at, chanak, but, lost, support, and, was, forced, to, step, down, as, prime, minister, curzon, remained, as, foreign, secretary, and, helped, tie, down, loose, ends, in, the, middle, east, at, the, peace, conference, at, lausanne, curzon, helped, to, negotiate, egyptian, independence, agreed, in, 1922, and, the, division, of, the, british, mandate, of, palestine, despite, the, strong, disagreement, he, held, with, the, policy, of, his, predecessor, arthur, balfour, and, helped, create, the, emirate, of, transjordan, for, faisal, s, brother, which, may, also, have, delayed, the, problems, there, according, to, sir, david, gilmour, curzon, was, the, only, senior, figure, in, the, british, government, at, the, time, who, foresaw, that, its, policy, would, lead, to, decades, of, arab, jewish, hostility, during, the, irish, war, of, independence, but, before, the, introduction, of, martial, law, in, december, 1920, curzon, suggested, the, indian, solution, of, blockading, villages, and, imposing, collective, fines, for, attacks, on, the, police, and, army, in, 1921, curzon, was, created, earl, of, kedleston, in, the, county, of, derby, and, marquess, curzon, of, kedleston, in, 1922, he, was, the, chief, negotiator, for, the, allies, of, the, treaty, of, lausanne, which, officially, ended, the, war, with, the, ottoman, empire, and, defined, the, borders, of, turkey, curzon, defended, the, geopolitical, talent, of, eyre, crowe, who, served, as, permanent, under, secretary, at, the, foreign, office, from, 1920, until, his, death, in, 1925, unlike, many, leading, conservative, members, of, lloyd, george, s, coalition, cabinet, curzon, ceased, to, support, lloyd, george, over, the, chanak, crisis, and, had, just, resigned, when, conservative, backbenchers, voted, at, the, carlton, club, meeting, to, end, the, coalition, in, october, 1922, curzon, was, thus, able, to, remain, foreign, secretary, when, bonar, law, formed, a, purely, conservative, ministry, in, 1922, 23, curzon, had, to, negotiate, with, france, after, french, troops, occupied, the, ruhr, to, enforce, the, payment, of, german, reparations, he, described, the, french, prime, minister, and, former, president, raymond, poincar, as, a, horrid, little, man, curzon, had, expansive, ambitions, and, was, not, much, happier, with, bonar, law, whose, foreign, policy, was, based, on, retrenchment, and, withdrawal, than, he, had, been, with, lloyd, george, curzon, provided, invaluable, insight, into, the, middle, east, and, was, instrumental, in, shaping, british, foreign, policy, in, that, region, on, bonar, law, s, retirement, as, prime, minister, in, may, 1923, curzon, was, passed, over, in, favour, of, stanley, baldwin, despite, his, eagerness, for, the, job, this, decision, was, taken, on, the, private, advice, of, leading, members, of, the, party, including, former, prime, minister, arthur, balfour, balfour, advised, the, monarch, that, in, a, democratic, age, it, was, inappropriate, for, the, prime, minister, to, be, a, member, of, the, house, of, lords, especially, when, the, labour, party, which, had, few, peers, had, become, the, main, opposition, party, in, the, commons, in, private, balfour, admitted, that, he, was, prejudiced, against, curzon, whose, character, was, objectionable, to, some, george, v, shared, this, prejudice, a, letter, purporting, to, detail, the, opinions, of, bonar, law, but, actually, written, by, baldwin, sympathisers, was, delivered, to, the, king, s, private, secretary, lord, stamfordham, though, it, is, unclear, how, much, impact, this, had, in, the, outcome, curzon, felt, he, was, cheated, because, j, c, c, davidson, to, whom, baldwin, was, loyal, and, sir, charles, waterhouse, falsely, claimed, to, stamfordham, that, law, had, recommended, that, george, v, appoint, stanley, baldwin, not, curzon, as, his, successor, harry, bennett, says, curzon, s, arrogance, and, unpopularity, probably, prevented, him, from, becoming, prime, minister, despite, his, brilliance, great, capacity, for, work, and, accomplishments, winston, churchill, one, of, curzon, s, main, rivals, accurately, contended, that, curzon, sow, gratitude, and, resentment, along, his, path, with, equally, lavish, hands, even, contemporaries, who, envied, curzon, such, as, baldwin, conceded, that, curzon, was, in, the, words, of, his, biographer, leonard, mosley, a, devoted, and, indefatigable, public, servant, dedicated, to, the, idea, of, empire, curzon, summoned, by, stamfordham, rushed, to, london, assuming, he, was, to, be, appointed, he, burst, into, tears, when, told, the, truth, he, later, ridiculed, baldwin, as, a, man, of, the, utmost, insignificance, although, he, served, under, baldwin, and, proposed, him, for, the, leadership, of, the, conservative, party, curzon, remained, foreign, secretary, under, baldwin, until, the, government, fell, in, january, 1924, when, baldwin, formed, a, new, government, in, november, 1924, he, appointed, curzon, lord, president, of, the, council, curzon, s, rejection, was, a, turning, point, in, the, nation, s, political, history, henceforth, by, convention, peers, were, deemed, to, be, barred, from, being, leaders, of, major, political, parties, and, from, becoming, prime, minister, in, an, age, of, democracy, it, was, no, longer, acceptable, for, the, prime, minister, to, be, based, in, an, unelected, and, largely, powerless, chamber, in, march, 1925, curzon, suffered, a, severe, haemorrhage, of, the, bladder, surgery, was, unsuccessful, and, he, died, in, london, on, 20, march, 1925, at, the, age, of, 66, his, coffin, made, from, the, same, tree, at, kedleston, that, had, encased, his, first, wife, mary, was, taken, to, westminster, abbey, and, from, there, to, his, ancestral, home, in, derbyshire, where, he, was, interred, beside, mary, in, the, family, vault, at, all, saints, church, on, 26, march, in, his, will, proven, on, 22, july, curzon, bequeathed, his, estate, to, his, wife, and, his, brother, francis, his, estate, was, valued, for, probate, at, 343, 279, 10s, 4d, roughly, equivalent, to, 25, million, in, 2023, upon, his, death, the, barony, earldom, and, marquessate, of, curzon, of, kedleston, and, the, earldom, of, kedleston, became, extinct, while, the, viscountcy, and, barony, of, scarsdale, were, inherited, by, a, nephew, the, barony, of, ravensdale, was, inherited, by, his, eldest, daughter, mary, and, is, today, held, by, his, second, daughter, cynthia, s, great, grandson, daniel, mosley, 4th, baron, ravensdale, there, is, a, blue, plaque, on, the, house, in, london, where, curzon, lived, and, died, no, 1, carlton, house, terrace, westminster, on, his, appointment, as, viceroy, of, india, in, 1898, he, was, created, baron, curzon, of, kedleston, in, the, county, of, derby, this, title, was, created, in, the, peerage, of, ireland, to, enable, him, to, potentially, return, to, the, house, of, commons, as, irish, peers, did, not, have, an, automatic, right, to, sit, in, the, house, of, lords, his, was, the, last, title, to, be, created, in, the, peerage, of, ireland, in, 1908, he, was, elected, a, representative, of, the, irish, peerage, in, the, british, house, of, lords, from, which, it, followed, that, he, would, be, a, member, of, the, house, of, lords, until, death, indeed, his, irish, representative, peerage, would, continue, even, if, as, proved, to, be, the, case, he, later, received, a, united, kingdom, peerage, entitling, him, to, a, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, in, his, own, right, in, 1911, he, was, created, earl, curzon, of, kedleston, viscount, scarsdale, and, baron, ravensdale, all, of, these, titles, were, in, the, peerage, of, the, united, kingdom, upon, his, father, s, death, in, 1916, he, also, became, 5th, baron, scarsdale, in, the, peerage, of, great, britain, the, title, had, been, created, in, 1761, in, the, 1921, birthday, honours, he, was, created, marquess, curzon, of, kedleston, the, title, became, extinct, upon, his, death, in, 1925, as, he, was, survived, by, three, daughters, and, no, sons, few, statesmen, have, experienced, such, changes, in, fortune, in, both, their, public, and, their, personal, lives, david, gilmour, concludes, curzon, s, career, was, an, almost, unparalleled, blend, of, triumph, and, disappointment, although, he, was, the, last, and, in, many, ways, the, greatest, of, victorian, viceroys, his, term, of, office, ended, in, resignation, empty, of, recognition, and, barren, of, reward, he, was, unable, to, assert, himself, fully, as, foreign, secretary, until, the, last, weeks, of, lloyd, george, s, premiership, and, finally, after, he, had, restored, his, reputation, at, lausanne, his, last, ambition, was, thwarted, by, george, v, critics, generally, agreed, that, curzon, never, reached, the, heights, that, his, youthful, talents, had, seemed, destined, to, reach, this, sense, of, opportunities, missed, was, summed, up, by, winston, churchill, in, his, book, great, contemporaries, 1937, the, morning, had, been, golden, the, noontide, was, bronze, and, the, evening, lead, but, all, were, polished, until, it, shone, after, its, fashion, churchill, also, wrote, there, was, certainly, something, lacking, in, curzon, it, was, certainly, not, information, nor, application, nor, power, of, speech, nor, attractiveness, of, manner, and, appearance, everything, was, in, his, equipment, you, could, unpack, his, knapsack, and, take, an, inventory, item, by, item, nothing, on, the, list, was, missing, yet, somehow, or, other, the, total, was, incomplete, his, cabinet, colleague, david, lindsay, 27th, earl, of, crawford, provided, a, withering, personal, judgment, in, his, diary, i, never, knew, a, man, less, loved, by, his, colleagues, and, more, hated, by, his, subordinates, never, a, man, so, bereft, of, conscience, of, charity, or, of, gratitude, on, the, other, hand, the, combination, of, power, of, industry, and, of, ambition, with, a, mean, personality, is, almost, without, parallel, i, never, attended, a, funeral, ceremony, at, which, the, congregation, was, so, dry, eyed, the, first, leader, of, independent, india, jawaharlal, nehru, paid, curzon, a, surprising, tribute, referring, to, the, fact, that, curzon, as, viceroy, exhibited, real, love, of, indian, culture, and, ordered, a, restoration, project, for, several, historic, monuments, including, the, taj, mahal, after, every, other, viceroy, has, been, forgotten, curzon, will, be, remembered, because, he, restored, all, that, was, beautiful, in, india, by, special, remainders, although, he, had, no, son, two, of, curzon, s, peerages, survive, to, the, present, day, his, barony, of, ravensdale, went, first, to, his, eldest, daughter, irene, curzon, 2nd, baroness,
