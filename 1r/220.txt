titus, maccius, plautus, p, l, t, s, plaw, t, s, c, 254, 184, bc, was, a, roman, playwright, of, the, old, latin, period, his, comedies, are, the, earliest, latin, literary, works, to, have, survived, in, their, entirety, he, wrote, palliata, comoedia, the, genre, devised, by, livius, andronicus, the, innovator, of, latin, literature, the, word, plautine, p, l, t, a, n, plaw, tyne, refers, to, both, plautus, s, own, works, and, works, similar, to, or, influenced, by, his, not, much, is, known, about, titus, maccius, plautus, s, early, life, it, is, believed, that, he, was, born, in, sarsina, a, small, town, in, emilia, romagna, in, northern, italy, around, 254, bc, according, to, morris, marples, plautus, worked, as, a, stage, carpenter, or, scene, shifter, in, his, early, years, it, is, from, this, work, perhaps, that, his, love, of, the, theater, originated, his, acting, talent, was, eventually, discovered, and, he, adopted, the, nomen, maccius, from, maccus, a, clownish, stock, character, in, atellan, farce, and, agnomen, plautus, trampled, flat, usually, in, reference, to, flat, footed, but, sometimes, intending, flat, eared, like, the, ears, of, a, hound, tradition, holds, that, he, made, enough, money, to, go, into, the, nautical, business, but, that, the, venture, collapsed, he, is, then, said, to, have, worked, as, a, manual, laborer, and, to, have, studied, greek, drama, particularly, the, new, comedy, of, menander, in, his, leisure, his, studies, allowed, him, to, produce, his, plays, which, were, released, between, c, 205, and, 184, bc, plautus, attained, such, popularity, that, his, name, alone, became, a, hallmark, of, theatrical, success, plautus, s, comedies, are, mostly, adapted, from, greek, models, for, a, roman, audience, and, are, often, based, directly, on, the, works, of, the, greek, playwrights, he, reworked, the, greek, texts, to, give, them, a, flavour, that, would, appeal, to, the, local, roman, audiences, they, are, the, earliest, surviving, intact, works, in, latin, literature, plautus, s, epitaph, read, postquam, est, mortem, aptus, plautus, comoedia, luget, scaena, deserta, dein, risus, ludus, iocusque, et, numeri, innumeri, simul, omnes, conlacrimarunt, since, plautus, is, dead, comedy, mourns, the, stage, is, deserted, then, laughter, jest, and, wit, and, all, melody, s, countless, numbers, wept, together, only, the, titles, and, various, fragments, of, these, plays, have, survived, the, oldest, manuscript, of, plautus, is, a, palimpsest, known, as, the, ambrosian, palimpsest, a, since, it, is, kept, in, the, ambrosian, library, in, milan, it, is, thought, to, date, to, the, 5th, century, but, it, was, not, discovered, until, 1815, this, manuscript, is, only, partly, legible, since, the, parchment, was, cleaned, and, a, copy, of, the, books, of, kings, and, chronicles, was, written, on, top, parts, of, the, text, are, completely, missing, for, example, nothing, survives, of, amphitruo, asinaria, aulularia, or, of, the, first, 475, lines, of, bacchides, and, other, parts, are, barely, legible, the, most, legible, parts, of, a, are, found, in, the, plays, persa, poenulus, pseudolus, and, stichus, despite, its, fragmentary, state, this, palimpsest, has, proved, very, valuable, in, correcting, the, errors, of, p, a, second, manuscript, tradition, is, represented, by, manuscripts, of, the, palatine, family, so, called, because, two, of, its, most, important, manuscripts, were, once, kept, in, the, library, of, the, elector, palatine, in, heidelberg, in, germany, the, archetype, of, this, family, is, now, lost, but, it, can, be, reconstructed, from, various, later, manuscripts, some, of, them, containing, either, only, the, first, half, or, the, second, half, of, the, plays, the, most, important, manuscript, of, this, group, is, b, of, the, 10th, or, early, 11th, century, now, kept, in, the, vatican, library, manuscripts, c, and, d, also, belong, to, this, family, the, lost, original, p, from, which, all, these, manuscripts, were, copied, is, ascribed, by, lindsay, to, the, 8th, or, 9th, century, because, of, certain, errors, which, both, a, and, the, p, family, have, in, common, it, is, thought, that, they, are, not, completely, independent, but, are, both, copies, of, a, single, manuscript, dating, to, perhaps, the, 4th, or, 5th, century, ad, at, some, stage, the, plays, in, the, p, family, were, divided, into, two, halves, one, containing, amphitruo, to, epidicus, omitting, bacchides, and, the, other, containing, bacchides, and, menaechmi, to, truculentus, the, first, eight, plays, are, found, in, b, and, the, first, three, and, part, of, captivi, are, found, in, d, the, last, twelve, plays, are, found, in, b, c, and, d, in, addition, there, was, once, a, fragmentary, manuscript, called, the, codex, turnebi, t, which, was, used, by, a, french, scholar, called, turn, be, in, the, 16th, century, although, this, manuscript, is, now, lost, some, readings, from, it, were, preserved, by, turn, be, himself, and, others, were, recorded, in, the, margins, of, a, 16th, century, edition, discovered, by, lindsay, in, the, bodleian, library, in, oxford, there, are, certain, indications, for, example, small, gaps, in, the, text, where, there, appears, to, have, been, in, a, hole, or, lacuna, in, the, parchment, that, the, original, p, manuscript, was, copied, from, an, earlier, manuscript, with, 19, 20, or, 21, lines, to, the, page, in, other, words, it, was, a, book, very, similar, to, a, which, has, 19, lines, to, the, page, and, probably, it, was, about, the, same, age, however, the, order, of, plays, in, a, is, slightly, different, from, that, in, the, p, family, of, manuscripts, the, headings, at, the, top, of, the, scenes, in, a, containing, character, names, which, were, written, in, red, ink, have, been, totally, washed, away, and, those, in, the, p, family, seem, to, be, based, on, guesswork, and, so, were, also, probably, missing, in, an, ancestor, of, the, lost, p, codex, for, this, reason, the, names, of, some, of, the, minor, characters, are, not, known, the, historical, context, within, which, plautus, wrote, can, be, seen, to, some, extent, in, his, comments, on, contemporary, events, and, persons, plautus, was, a, popular, comedic, playwright, while, roman, theatre, was, still, in, its, infancy, and, still, largely, undeveloped, at, the, same, time, the, roman, republic, was, expanding, in, power, and, influence, plautus, was, sometimes, accused, of, teaching, the, public, indifference, and, mockery, of, the, gods, any, character, in, his, plays, could, be, compared, to, a, god, whether, to, honour, a, character, or, to, mock, him, these, references, were, demeaning, to, the, gods, these, references, to, the, gods, include, a, character, comparing, a, mortal, woman, to, a, god, or, saying, he, would, rather, be, loved, by, a, woman, than, by, the, gods, pyrgopolynices, from, miles, gloriosus, vs, 1265, in, bragging, about, his, long, life, says, he, was, born, one, day, later, than, jupiter, in, curculio, phaedrome, says, i, am, a, god, when, he, first, meets, with, planesium, in, pseudolus, jupiter, is, compared, to, ballio, the, pimp, it, is, not, uncommon, too, for, a, character, to, scorn, the, gods, as, seen, in, poenulus, and, rudens, however, when, a, character, scorns, a, god, it, is, usually, a, character, of, low, standing, such, as, a, pimp, plautus, perhaps, does, this, to, demoralize, the, characters, soldiers, often, bring, ridicule, among, the, gods, young, men, meant, to, represent, the, upper, social, class, often, belittle, the, gods, in, their, remarks, parasites, pimps, and, courtesans, often, praise, the, gods, with, scant, ceremony, tolliver, argues, that, drama, both, reflects, and, foreshadows, social, change, it, is, likely, that, there, was, already, much, skepticism, about, the, gods, in, plautus, era, plautus, did, not, make, up, or, encourage, irreverence, to, the, gods, but, reflected, ideas, of, his, time, the, state, controlled, stage, productions, and, plautus, plays, would, have, been, banned, had, they, been, too, risqu, the, second, punic, war, occurred, from, 218, to, 201, bc, its, central, event, was, hannibal, s, invasion, of, italy, m, leigh, has, devoted, an, extensive, chapter, about, plautus, and, hannibal, in, his, 2004, book, comedy, and, the, rise, of, rome, he, says, that, the, plays, themselves, contain, occasional, references, to, the, fact, that, the, state, is, at, arms, one, good, example, is, a, piece, of, verse, from, the, miles, gloriosus, the, composition, date, of, which, is, not, clear, but, which, is, often, placed, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, a, f, west, believes, that, this, is, inserted, commentary, on, the, second, punic, war, in, his, article, on, a, patriotic, passage, in, the, miles, gloriosus, of, plautus, he, states, that, the, war, engrossed, the, romans, more, than, all, other, public, interests, combined, the, passage, seems, intended, to, rile, up, the, audience, beginning, with, hostis, tibi, adesse, or, the, foe, is, near, at, hand, at, the, time, the, general, scipio, africanus, wanted, to, confront, hannibal, a, plan, strongly, favored, by, the, plebs, plautus, apparently, pushes, for, the, plan, to, be, approved, by, the, senate, working, his, audience, up, with, the, thought, of, an, enemy, in, close, proximity, and, a, call, to, outmaneuver, him, therefore, it, is, reasonable, to, say, that, plautus, according, to, p, b, harvey, was, willing, to, insert, highly, specific, allusions, comprehensible, to, the, audience, m, leigh, writes, in, his, chapter, on, plautus, and, hannibal, that, the, plautus, who, emerges, from, this, investigation, is, one, whose, comedies, persistently, touch, the, rawest, nerves, in, the, audience, for, whom, he, writes, later, coming, off, the, heels, of, the, conflict, with, hannibal, rome, was, preparing, to, embark, on, another, military, mission, this, time, in, greece, while, they, would, eventually, move, on, philip, v, in, the, second, macedonian, war, there, was, considerable, debate, beforehand, about, the, course, rome, should, take, in, this, conflict, but, starting, this, war, would, not, be, an, easy, task, considering, those, recent, struggles, with, carthage, many, romans, were, too, tired, of, conflict, to, think, of, embarking, on, another, campaign, as, w, m, owens, writes, in, his, article, plautus, stichus, and, the, political, crisis, of, 200, b, c, there, is, evidence, that, antiwar, feeling, ran, deep, and, persisted, even, after, the, war, was, approved, owens, contends, that, plautus, was, attempting, to, match, the, complex, mood, of, the, roman, audience, riding, the, victory, of, the, second, punic, war, but, facing, the, beginning, of, a, new, conflict, for, instance, the, characters, of, the, dutiful, daughters, and, their, father, seem, obsessed, over, the, idea, of, officium, the, duty, one, has, to, do, what, is, right, their, speech, is, littered, with, words, such, as, pietas, and, aequus, and, they, struggle, to, make, their, father, fulfill, his, proper, role, the, stock, parasite, in, this, play, gelasimus, has, a, patron, client, relationship, with, this, family, and, offers, to, do, any, job, in, order, to, make, ends, meet, owens, puts, forward, that, plautus, is, portraying, the, economic, hardship, many, roman, citizens, were, experiencing, due, to, the, cost, of, war, with, the, repetition, of, responsibility, to, the, desperation, of, the, lower, class, plautus, establishes, himself, firmly, on, the, side, of, the, average, roman, citizen, while, he, makes, no, specific, reference, to, the, possible, war, with, greece, or, the, previous, war, that, might, be, too, dangerous, he, does, seem, to, push, the, message, that, the, government, should, take, care, of, its, own, people, before, attempting, any, other, military, actions, greek, new, comedy, greatly, differs, from, those, plays, of, aristophanes, the, most, notable, difference, according, to, dana, f, sutton, is, that, new, comedy, in, comparison, to, old, comedy, is, devoid, of, a, serious, political, social, or, intellectual, content, and, could, be, performed, in, any, number, of, social, and, political, settings, without, risk, of, giving, offense, the, risk, taking, for, which, aristophanes, is, known, is, noticeably, lacking, in, the, new, comedy, plays, of, menander, instead, there, is, much, more, of, a, focus, on, the, home, and, the, family, unit, something, that, the, romans, including, plautus, could, easily, understand, and, adopt, for, themselves, later, in, history, one, main, theme, of, greek, new, comedy, is, the, father, son, relationship, for, example, in, menander, s, dis, exapaton, there, is, a, focus, on, the, betrayal, between, age, groups, and, friends, the, father, son, relationship, is, very, strong, and, the, son, remains, loyal, to, the, father, the, relationship, is, always, a, focus, even, if, it, s, not, the, focus, of, every, action, taken, by, the, main, characters, in, plautus, on, the, other, hand, the, focus, is, still, on, the, relationship, between, father, and, son, but, we, see, betrayal, between, the, two, men, that, wasn, t, seen, in, menander, there, is, a, focus, on, the, proper, conduct, between, a, father, and, son, that, apparently, was, so, important, to, roman, society, at, the, time, of, plautus, this, becomes, the, main, difference, and, also, similarity, between, menander, and, plautus, they, both, address, situations, that, tend, to, develop, in, the, bosom, of, the, family, both, authors, through, their, plays, reflect, a, patriarchal, society, in, which, the, father, son, relationship, is, essential, to, proper, function, and, development, of, the, household, it, is, no, longer, a, political, statement, as, in, old, comedy, but, a, statement, about, household, relations, and, proper, behavior, between, a, father, and, his, son, but, the, attitudes, on, these, relationships, seem, much, different, a, reflection, of, how, the, worlds, of, menander, and, plautus, differed, there, are, differences, not, just, in, how, the, father, son, relationship, is, presented, but, also, in, the, way, in, which, menander, and, plautus, write, their, poetry, william, s, anderson, discusses, the, believability, of, menander, versus, the, believability, of, plautus, and, in, essence, says, that, plautus, plays, are, much, less, believable, than, those, plays, of, menander, because, they, seem, to, be, such, a, farce, in, comparison, he, addresses, them, as, a, reflection, of, menander, with, some, of, plautus, own, contributions, anderson, argues, there, is, unevenness, in, the, poetry, of, plautus, that, results, in, incredulity, and, refusal, of, sympathy, of, the, audience, the, poetry, of, menander, and, plautus, is, best, juxtaposed, in, their, prologues, robert, b, lloyd, makes, the, point, that, albeit, the, two, prologues, introduce, plays, whose, plots, are, of, essentially, different, types, they, are, almost, identical, in, form, he, goes, on, to, address, the, specific, style, of, plautus, that, differs, so, greatly, from, menander, he, says, that, the, verbosity, of, the, plautine, prologues, has, often, been, commented, upon, and, generally, excused, by, the, necessity, of, the, roman, playwright, to, win, his, audience, however, in, both, menander, and, plautus, word, play, is, essential, to, their, comedy, plautus, might, seem, more, verbose, but, where, he, lacks, in, physical, comedy, he, makes, up, for, it, with, words, alliteration, and, paronomasia, punning, see, also, jokes, and, wordplay, below, plautus, is, well, known, for, his, devotion, to, puns, especially, when, it, comes, to, the, names, of, his, characters, in, miles, gloriosus, for, instance, the, female, concubine, s, name, philocomasium, translates, to, lover, of, a, good, party, which, is, quite, apt, when, we, learn, about, the, tricks, and, wild, ways, of, this, prostitute, plautus, characters, many, of, which, seem, to, crop, up, in, quite, a, few, of, his, plays, also, came, from, greek, stock, though, they, too, received, some, plautine, innovations, indeed, since, plautus, was, adapting, these, plays, it, would, be, difficult, not, to, have, the, same, kinds, of, characters, roles, such, as, slaves, concubines, soldiers, and, old, men, by, working, with, the, characters, that, were, already, there, but, injecting, his, own, creativity, as, j, c, b, lowe, wrote, in, his, article, aspects, of, plautus, originality, in, the, asinaria, plautus, could, substantially, modify, the, characterization, and, thus, the, whole, emphasis, of, a, play, one, of, the, best, examples, of, this, method, is, the, plautine, slave, a, form, that, plays, a, major, role, in, quite, a, few, of, plautus, works, the, clever, slave, in, particular, is, a, very, strong, character, he, not, only, provides, exposition, and, humor, but, also, often, drives, the, plot, in, plautus, plays, c, stace, argues, that, plautus, took, the, stock, slave, character, from, new, comedy, in, greece, and, altered, it, for, his, own, purposes, in, new, comedy, he, writes, the, slave, is, often, not, much, more, than, a, comedic, turn, with, the, added, purpose, perhaps, of, exposition, this, shows, that, there, was, precedent, for, this, slave, archetype, and, obviously, some, of, its, old, role, continues, in, plautus, the, expository, monologues, for, instance, however, because, plautus, found, humor, in, slaves, tricking, their, masters, or, comparing, themselves, to, great, heroes, he, took, the, character, a, step, further, and, created, something, distinct, of, the, approximate, 270, proper, names, in, the, surviving, plays, of, plautus, about, 250, names, are, greek, william, m, seaman, proposes, that, these, greek, names, would, have, delivered, a, comic, punch, to, the, audience, because, of, its, basic, understanding, of, the, greek, language, this, previous, understanding, of, greek, language, seaman, suggests, comes, from, the, experience, of, roman, soldiers, during, the, first, and, second, punic, wars, not, only, did, men, billeted, in, greek, areas, have, opportunity, to, learn, sufficient, greek, for, the, purpose, of, everyday, conversation, but, they, were, also, able, to, see, plays, in, the, foreign, tongue, having, an, audience, with, knowledge, of, the, greek, language, whether, limited, or, more, expanded, allowed, plautus, more, freedom, to, use, greek, references, and, words, also, by, using, his, many, greek, references, and, showing, that, his, plays, were, originally, greek, it, is, possible, that, plautus, was, in, a, way, a, teacher, of, greek, literature, myth, art, and, philosophy, so, too, was, he, teaching, something, of, the, nature, of, greek, words, to, people, who, like, himself, had, recently, come, into, closer, contact, with, that, foreign, tongue, and, all, its, riches, at, the, time, of, plautus, rome, was, expanding, and, having, much, success, in, greece, w, s, anderson, has, commented, that, plautus, is, using, and, abusing, greek, comedy, to, imply, the, superiority, of, rome, in, all, its, crude, vitality, over, the, greek, world, which, was, now, the, political, dependent, of, rome, whose, effete, comic, plots, helped, explain, why, the, greeks, proved, inadequate, in, the, real, world, of, the, third, and, second, centuries, in, which, the, romans, exercised, mastery, plautus, was, known, for, the, use, of, greek, style, in, his, plays, as, part, of, the, tradition, of, the, variation, on, a, theme, this, has, been, a, point, of, contention, among, modern, scholars, one, argument, states, that, plautus, writes, with, originality, and, creativity, the, other, that, plautus, is, a, copycat, of, greek, new, comedy, and, that, he, makes, no, original, contribution, to, playwriting, a, single, reading, of, the, miles, gloriosus, leaves, the, reader, with, the, notion, that, the, names, place, and, play, are, all, greek, but, one, must, look, beyond, these, superficial, interpretations, w, s, anderson, would, steer, any, reader, away, from, the, idea, that, plautus, plays, are, somehow, not, his, own, or, at, least, only, his, interpretation, anderson, says, that, plautus, homogenizes, all, the, plays, as, vehicles, for, his, special, exploitation, against, the, spirit, of, the, greek, original, he, engineers, events, at, the, end, or, alter, the, situation, to, fit, his, expectations, anderson, s, vehement, reaction, to, the, co, opting, of, greek, plays, by, plautus, seems, to, suggest, that, they, are, in, no, way, like, their, originals, were, it, seems, more, likely, that, plautus, was, just, experimenting, putting, roman, ideas, in, greek, forms, one, idea, that, is, important, to, recognize, is, that, of, contaminatio, which, refers, to, the, mixing, of, elements, of, two, or, more, source, plays, plautus, it, seems, is, quite, open, to, this, method, of, adaptation, and, quite, a, few, of, his, plots, seem, stitched, together, from, different, stories, one, excellent, example, is, his, bacchides, and, its, supposed, greek, predecessor, menander, s, dis, exapaton, the, original, greek, title, translates, as, the, man, deceiving, twice, yet, the, plautine, version, has, three, tricks, v, castellani, commented, that, plautus, attack, on, the, genre, whose, material, he, pirated, was, as, already, stated, fourfold, he, deconstructed, many, of, the, greek, plays, finely, constructed, plots, he, reduced, some, exaggerated, others, of, the, nicely, drawn, characters, of, menander, and, of, menander, s, contemporaries, and, followers, into, caricatures, he, substituted, for, or, superimposed, upon, the, elegant, humor, of, his, models, his, own, more, vigorous, more, simply, ridiculous, foolery, in, action, in, statement, even, in, language, by, exploring, ideas, about, roman, loyalty, greek, deceit, and, differences, in, ethnicity, plautus, in, a, sense, surpassed, his, model, he, was, not, content, to, rest, solely, on, a, loyal, adaptation, that, while, amusing, was, not, new, or, engaging, for, rome, plautus, took, what, he, found, but, again, made, sure, to, expand, subtract, and, modify, he, seems, to, have, followed, the, same, path, that, horace, did, though, horace, is, much, later, in, that, he, is, putting, roman, ideas, in, greek, forms, he, not, only, imitated, the, greeks, but, in, fact, distorted, cut, up, and, transformed, the, plays, into, something, entirely, roman, in, essence, it, is, greek, theater, colonized, by, rome, and, its, playwrights, in, ancient, greece, during, the, time, of, new, comedy, from, which, plautus, drew, so, much, of, his, inspiration, there, were, permanent, theaters, that, catered, to, the, audience, as, well, as, the, actor, the, greatest, playwrights, of, the, day, had, quality, facilities, in, which, to, present, their, work, and, in, a, general, sense, there, was, always, enough, public, support, to, keep, the, theater, running, and, successful, however, this, was, not, the, case, in, rome, during, the, time, of, the, republic, when, plautus, wrote, his, plays, while, there, was, public, support, for, theater, and, people, came, to, enjoy, tragedy, and, comedy, alike, no, permanent, theater, existed, in, rome, until, pompey, dedicated, one, in, 55, bc, in, the, campus, martius, the, lack, of, a, permanent, space, was, a, key, factor, in, roman, theater, and, plautine, stagecraft, in, their, introduction, to, the, miles, gloriosus, hammond, mack, and, moskalew, say, that, the, romans, were, acquainted, with, the, greek, stone, theater, but, because, they, believed, drama, to, be, a, demoralizing, influence, they, had, a, strong, aversion, to, the, erection, of, permanent, theaters, this, worry, rings, true, when, considering, the, subject, matter, of, plautus, plays, the, unreal, becomes, reality, on, stage, in, his, work, t, j, moore, notes, that, all, distinction, between, the, play, production, and, real, life, has, been, obliterated, a, place, where, social, norms, were, upended, was, inherently, suspect, the, aristocracy, was, afraid, of, the, power, of, the, theater, it, was, merely, by, their, good, graces, and, unlimited, resources, that, a, temporary, stage, would, have, been, built, during, specific, festivals, roman, drama, specifically, plautine, comedy, was, acted, out, on, stage, during, the, ludi, or, festival, games, in, his, discussion, of, the, importance, of, the, ludi, megalenses, in, early, roman, theater, john, arthur, hanson, says, that, this, particular, festival, provided, more, days, for, dramatic, representations, than, any, of, the, other, regular, festivals, and, it, is, in, connection, with, these, ludi, that, the, most, definite, and, secure, literary, evidence, for, the, site, of, scenic, games, has, come, down, to, us, because, the, ludi, were, religious, in, nature, it, was, appropriate, for, the, romans, to, set, up, this, temporary, stage, close, to, the, temple, of, the, deity, being, celebrated, s, m, goldberg, notes, that, ludi, were, generally, held, within, the, precinct, of, the, particular, god, being, honored, t, j, moore, notes, that, seating, in, the, temporary, theaters, where, plautus, plays, were, first, performed, was, often, insufficient, for, all, those, who, wished, to, see, the, play, that, the, primary, criterion, for, determining, who, was, to, stand, and, who, could, sit, was, social, status, this, is, not, to, say, that, the, lower, classes, did, not, see, the, plays, but, they, probably, had, to, stand, while, watching, plays, were, performed, in, public, for, the, public, with, the, most, prominent, members, of, the, society, in, the, forefront, the, wooden, stages, on, which, plautus, plays, appeared, were, shallow, and, long, with, three, openings, in, respect, to, the, scene, house, the, stages, were, significantly, smaller, than, any, greek, structure, familiar, to, modern, scholars, because, theater, was, not, a, priority, during, plautus, time, the, structures, were, built, and, dismantled, within, a, day, even, more, practically, they, were, dismantled, quickly, due, to, their, potential, as, fire, hazards, often, the, geography, of, the, stage, and, more, importantly, the, play, matched, the, geography, of, the, city, so, that, the, audience, would, be, well, oriented, to, the, locale, of, the, play, moore, says, that, references, to, roman, locales, must, have, been, stunning, for, they, are, not, merely, references, to, things, roman, but, the, most, blatant, possible, reminders, that, the, production, occurs, in, the, city, of, rome, so, plautus, seems, to, have, choreographed, his, plays, somewhat, true, to, life, to, do, this, he, needed, his, characters, to, exit, and, enter, to, or, from, whatever, area, their, social, standing, would, befit, two, scholars, v, j, rosivach, and, n, e, andrews, have, made, interesting, observations, about, stagecraft, in, plautus, v, j, rosivach, writes, about, identifying, the, side, of, the, stage, with, both, social, status, and, geography, he, says, that, for, example, the, house, of, the, medicus, lies, offstage, to, the, right, it, would, be, in, the, forum, or, thereabouts, that, one, would, expect, to, find, a, medicus, moreover, he, says, that, characters, that, oppose, one, another, always, have, to, exit, in, opposite, directions, in, a, slightly, different, vein, n, e, andrews, discusses, the, spatial, semantics, of, plautus, she, has, observed, that, even, the, different, spaces, of, the, stage, are, thematically, charged, she, states, plautus, casina, employs, these, conventional, tragic, correlations, between, male, outside, and, female, inside, but, then, inverts, them, in, order, to, establish, an, even, more, complex, relationship, among, genre, gender, and, dramatic, space, in, the, casina, the, struggle, for, control, between, men, and, women, is, articulated, by, characters, efforts, to, control, stage, movement, into, and, out, of, the, house, andrews, makes, note, of, the, fact, that, power, struggle, in, the, casina, is, evident, in, the, verbal, comings, and, goings, the, words, of, action, and, the, way, that, they, are, said, are, important, to, stagecraft, the, words, denoting, direction, or, action, such, as, abeo, i, go, off, transeo, i, go, over, fores, crepuerunt, the, doors, creak, or, intus, inside, which, signal, any, character, s, departure, or, entrance, are, standard, in, the, dialogue, of, plautus, plays, these, verbs, of, motion, or, phrases, can, be, taken, as, plautine, stage, directions, since, no, overt, stage, directions, are, apparent, often, though, in, these, interchanges, of, characters, there, occurs, the, need, to, move, on, to, the, next, act, plautus, then, might, use, what, is, known, as, a, cover, monologue, about, this, s, m, goldberg, notes, that, it, marks, the, passage, of, time, less, by, its, length, than, by, its, direct, and, immediate, address, to, the, audience, and, by, its, switch, from, senarii, in, the, dialogue, to, iambic, septenarii, the, resulting, shift, of, mood, distracts, and, distorts, our, sense, of, passing, time, the, small, stages, had, a, significant, effect, on, the, stagecraft, of, ancient, roman, theater, because, of, this, limited, space, there, was, also, limited, movement, greek, theater, allowed, for, grand, gestures, and, extensive, action, to, reach, the, audience, members, who, were, in, the, very, back, of, the, theater, however, the, romans, would, have, had, to, depend, more, on, their, voices, than, large, physicality, there, was, not, an, orchestra, available, as, there, was, for, the, greeks, and, this, is, reflected, in, the, notable, lack, of, a, chorus, in, roman, drama, the, replacement, character, that, acts, as, the, chorus, would, in, greek, drama, is, often, called, the, prologue, goldberg, says, that, these, changes, fostered, a, different, relationship, between, actors, and, the, space, in, which, they, performed, and, also, between, them, and, their, audiences, actors, were, thrust, into, much, closer, audience, interaction, because, of, this, a, certain, acting, style, became, required, that, is, more, familiar, to, modern, audiences, because, they, would, have, been, in, such, close, proximity, to, the, actors, ancient, roman, audiences, would, have, wanted, attention, and, direct, acknowledgement, from, the, actors, because, there, was, no, orchestra, there, was, no, space, separating, the, audience, from, the, stage, the, audience, could, stand, directly, in, front, of, the, elevated, wooden, platform, this, gave, them, the, opportunity, to, look, at, the, actors, from, a, much, different, perspective, they, would, have, seen, every, detail, of, the, actor, and, heard, every, word, he, said, the, audience, member, would, have, wanted, that, actor, to, speak, directly, to, them, it, was, a, part, of, the, thrill, of, the, performance, as, it, is, to, this, day, plautus, range, of, characters, was, created, through, his, use, of, various, techniques, but, probably, the, most, important, is, his, use, of, stock, characters, and, situations, in, his, various, plays, he, incorporates, the, same, stock, characters, constantly, especially, when, the, character, type, is, amusing, to, the, audience, as, walter, juniper, wrote, everything, including, artistic, characterization, and, consistency, of, characterization, were, sacrificed, to, humor, and, character, portrayal, remained, only, where, it, was, necessary, for, the, success, of, the, plot, and, humor, to, have, a, persona, who, stayed, in, character, and, where, the, persona, by, his, portrayal, contributed, to, humor, for, example, in, miles, gloriosus, the, titular, braggart, soldier, pyrgopolynices, only, shows, his, vain, and, immodest, side, in, the, first, act, while, the, parasite, artotrogus, exaggerates, pyrgopolynices, achievements, creating, more, and, more, ludicrous, claims, that, pyrgopolynices, agrees, to, without, question, these, two, are, perfect, examples, of, the, stock, characters, of, the, pompous, soldier, and, the, desperate, parasite, that, appeared, in, plautine, comedies, in, disposing, of, highly, complex, individuals, plautus, was, supplying, his, audience, with, what, it, wanted, since, the, audience, to, whose, tastes, plautus, catered, was, not, interested, in, the, character, play, but, instead, wanted, the, broad, and, accessible, humor, offered, by, stock, set, ups, the, humor, plautus, offered, such, as, puns, word, plays, distortions, of, meaning, or, other, forms, of, verbal, humor, he, usually, puts, them, in, the, mouths, of, characters, belonging, to, the, lower, social, ranks, to, whose, language, and, position, these, varieties, of, humorous, technique, are, most, suitable, matched, well, with, the, stable, of, characters, in, his, article, the, intriguing, slave, in, greek, comedy, philip, harsh, gives, evidence, to, show, that, the, clever, slave, is, not, an, invention, of, plautus, while, previous, critics, such, as, a, w, gomme, believed, that, the, slave, was, truly, comic, character, the, devisor, of, ingenious, schemes, the, controller, of, events, the, commanding, officer, of, his, young, master, and, friends, is, a, creation, of, latin, comedy, and, that, greek, dramatists, such, as, menander, did, not, use, slaves, in, such, a, way, that, plautus, later, did, harsh, refutes, these, beliefs, by, giving, concrete, examples, of, instances, where, a, clever, slave, appeared, in, greek, comedy, for, instance, in, the, works, of, athenaeus, alciphron, and, lucian, there, are, deceptions, that, involve, the, aid, of, a, slave, and, in, menander, s, dis, exapaton, there, was, an, elaborate, deception, executed, by, a, clever, slave, that, plautus, mirrors, in, his, bacchides, evidence, of, clever, slaves, also, appears, in, menander, s, thalis, hypobolimaios, and, from, the, papyrus, fragment, of, his, perinthia, harsh, acknowledges, that, gomme, s, statement, was, probably, made, before, the, discovery, of, many, of, the, papyri, that, we, now, have, while, it, was, not, necessarily, a, roman, invention, plautus, did, develop, his, own, style, of, depicting, the, clever, slave, with, larger, more, active, roles, more, verbal, exaggeration, and, exuberance, the, slave, was, moved, by, plautus, further, into, the, front, of, the, action, because, of, the, inversion, of, order, created, by, a, devious, or, witty, slave, this, stock, character, was, perfect, for, achieving, a, humorous, response, and, the, traits, of, the, character, worked, well, for, driving, the, plot, forward, another, important, plautine, stock, character, discussed, by, k, c, ryder, is, the, senex, amator, a, senex, amator, is, classified, as, an, old, man, who, contracts, a, passion, for, a, young, girl, and, who, in, varying, degrees, attempts, to, satisfy, this, passion, in, plautus, these, men, are, demaenetus, asinaria, philoxenus, and, nicobulus, bacchides, demipho, cistellaria, lysidamus, casina, demipho, mercator, and, antipho, stichus, periplectomenos, miles, gloriosus, and, daemones, rudens, are, regarded, as, senes, lepidi, because, they, usually, keep, their, feelings, within, a, respectable, limit, all, of, these, characters, have, the, same, goal, to, be, with, a, younger, woman, but, all, go, about, it, in, different, ways, as, plautus, could, not, be, too, redundant, with, his, characters, despite, their, already, obvious, similarities, what, they, have, in, common, is, the, ridicule, with, which, their, attempts, are, viewed, the, imagery, that, suggests, that, they, are, motivated, largely, by, animal, passion, the, childish, behavior, and, the, reversion, to, the, love, language, of, their, youth, in, examining, the, female, role, designations, of, plautus, s, plays, z, m, packman, found, that, they, are, not, as, stable, as, their, male, counterparts, a, senex, will, usually, remain, a, senex, for, the, duration, of, the, play, but, designations, like, matrona, mulier, or, uxor, at, times, seem, interchangeable, most, free, adult, women, married, or, widowed, appear, in, scene, headings, as, mulier, simply, translated, as, woman, but, in, plautus, stichus, the, two, young, women, are, referred, to, as, sorores, later, mulieres, and, then, matronae, all, of, which, have, different, meanings, and, connotations, although, there, are, these, discrepancies, packman, tries, to, give, a, pattern, to, the, female, role, designations, of, plautus, mulier, is, typically, given, to, a, woman, of, citizen, class, and, of, marriageable, age, or, who, has, already, been, married, unmarried, citizen, class, girls, regardless, of, sexual, experience, were, designated, virgo, ancilla, was, the, term, used, for, female, household, slaves, with, anus, reserved, for, the, elderly, household, slaves, a, young, woman, who, is, unwed, due, to, social, status, is, usually, referred, to, as, meretrix, or, courtesan, a, lena, or, adoptive, mother, may, be, a, woman, who, owns, these, girls, like, packman, george, duckworth, uses, the, scene, headings, in, the, manuscripts, to, support, his, theory, about, unnamed, plautine, characters, there, are, approximately, 220, characters, in, the, 20, plays, of, plautus, thirty, are, unnamed, in, both, the, scene, headings, and, the, text, and, there, are, about, nine, characters, who, are, named, in, the, ancient, text, but, not, in, any, modern, one, this, means, that, about, 18, of, the, total, number, of, characters, in, plautus, are, nameless, most, of, the, very, important, characters, have, names, while, most, of, the, unnamed, characters, are, of, less, importance, however, there, are, some, abnormalities, the, main, character, in, casina, is, not, mentioned, by, name, anywhere, in, the, text, in, other, instances, plautus, will, give, a, name, to, a, character, that, only, has, a, few, words, or, lines, one, explanation, is, that, some, of, the, names, have, been, lost, over, the, years, and, for, the, most, part, major, characters, do, have, names, plautus, wrote, in, a, colloquial, style, far, from, the, codified, form, of, latin, that, is, found, in, ovid, or, virgil, this, colloquial, style, is, the, everyday, speech, that, plautus, would, have, been, familiar, with, yet, that, means, that, most, students, of, latin, are, unfamiliar, with, it, adding, to, the, unfamiliarity, of, plautine, language, is, the, inconsistency, of, the, irregularities, that, occur, in, the, texts, in, one, of, his, studies, a, w, hodgman, noted, that, the, statements, that, one, meets, with, that, this, or, that, form, is, common, or, regular, in, plautus, are, frequently, misleading, or, even, incorrect, and, are, usually, unsatisfying, i, have, gained, an, increasing, respect, for, the, manuscript, tradition, a, growing, belief, that, the, irregularities, are, after, all, in, a, certain, sense, regular, the, whole, system, of, inflexion, and, i, suspect, of, syntax, also, and, of, versification, was, less, fixed, and, stable, in, plautus, time, than, it, became, later, the, diction, of, plautus, who, used, the, colloquial, speech, of, his, own, day, is, distinctive, and, non, standard, from, the, point, of, view, of, the, later, classical, period, m, hammond, a, h, mack, and, w, moskalew, have, noted, in, the, introduction, to, their, edition, of, the, miles, gloriosus, that, plautus, was, free, from, convention, sought, to, reproduce, the, easy, tone, of, daily, speech, rather, than, the, formal, regularity, of, oratory, or, poetry, hence, many, of, the, irregularities, which, have, troubled, scribes, and, scholars, perhaps, merely, reflect, the, everyday, usages, of, the, careless, and, untrained, tongues, which, plautus, heard, about, him, looking, at, the, overall, use, of, archaic, forms, in, plautus, one, notes, that, they, commonly, occur, in, promises, agreements, threats, prologues, or, speeches, plautus, s, archaic, forms, are, metrically, convenient, but, may, also, have, had, a, stylistic, effect, on, his, original, audience, these, forms, are, frequent, and, of, too, great, a, number, for, a, complete, list, here, but, some, of, the, most, noteworthy, features, which, from, the, classical, perspective, will, be, considered, irregular, or, obsolete, are, these, are, the, most, common, linguistic, peculiarities, from, the, later, perspective, in, the, plays, of, plautus, some, of, them, being, also, found, in, terence, and, noting, them, helps, in, the, reading, of, his, works, and, gives, insight, into, early, roman, language, and, interaction, there, are, certain, ways, in, which, plautus, expressed, himself, in, his, plays, and, these, individual, means, of, expression, give, a, certain, flair, to, his, style, of, writing, the, means, of, expression, are, not, always, specific, to, the, writer, i, e, idiosyncratic, yet, they, are, characteristic, of, the, writer, two, examples, of, these, characteristic, means, of, expression, are, the, use, of, proverbs, and, the, use, of, greek, language, in, the, plays, of, plautus, plautus, employed, the, use, of, proverbs, in, many, of, his, plays, proverbs, would, address, a, certain, genre, such, as, law, religion, medicine, trades, crafts, and, seafaring, plautus, proverbs, and, proverbial, expressions, number, into, the, hundreds, they, sometimes, appear, alone, or, interwoven, within, a, speech, the, most, common, appearance, of, proverbs, in, plautus, appears, to, be, at, the, end, of, a, soliloquy, plautus, does, this, for, dramatic, effect, to, emphasize, a, point, further, interwoven, into, the, plays, of, plautus, and, just, as, common, as, the, use, of, proverbs, is, the, use, of, greek, within, the, texts, of, the, plays, j, n, hough, suggests, that, plautus, s, use, of, greek, is, for, artistic, purposes, and, not, simply, because, a, latin, phrase, will, not, fit, the, meter, greek, words, are, used, when, describing, foods, oils, perfumes, etc, this, is, similar, to, the, use, of, french, terms, in, the, english, language, such, as, gar, on, or, rendezvous, these, words, give, the, language, a, french, flair, just, as, greek, did, to, the, latin, speaking, romans, slaves, or, characters, of, low, standing, speak, much, of, the, greek, one, possible, explanation, for, this, is, that, many, roman, slaves, were, foreigners, of, greek, origin, plautus, would, sometimes, incorporate, passages, in, other, languages, as, well, in, places, where, it, would, suit, his, characters, a, noteworthy, example, is, the, use, of, two, prayers, in, punic, in, poenulus, spoken, by, the, carthaginian, elder, hanno, which, are, significant, to, semitic, linguistics, because, they, preserve, the, carthaginian, pronunciation, of, the, vowels, unlike, greek, plautus, most, probably, did, not, speak, punic, himself, nor, was, the, audience, likely, to, understand, it, the, text, of, the, prayers, themselves, was, probably, provided, by, a, carthaginian, informant, and, plautus, incorporated, it, to, emphasize, the, authenticity, and, foreignness, of, hanno, s, character, plautus, also, used, more, technical, means, of, expression, in, his, plays, one, tool, that, plautus, used, for, the, expression, of, his, servus, callidus, stock, character, was, alliteration, alliteration, is, the, repetition, of, sounds, in, a, sentence, or, clause, those, sounds, usually, come, at, the, beginning, of, words, in, the, miles, gloriosus, the, servus, callidus, is, palaestrio, as, he, speaks, with, the, character, periplectomenus, he, uses, a, significant, amount, of, alliteration, in, order, to, assert, his, cleverness, and, therefore, his, authority, plautus, uses, phrases, such, as, falsiloquom, falsicum, falsiiurium, mg, l, 191, these, words, express, the, deep, and, respectable, knowledge, that, palaestrio, has, of, the, latin, language, alliteration, can, also, happen, at, the, endings, of, words, as, well, for, example, palaestrio, says, linguam, perfidiam, malitiam, atque, audaciam, confidentiam, confirmitatem, fraudulentiam, mg, ll, 188, 9, also, used, as, seen, above, is, the, technique, of, assonance, which, is, the, repetition, of, similar, sounding, syllables, plautus, comedies, abound, in, puns, and, word, play, which, is, an, important, component, of, his, poetry, one, well, known, instance, in, the, miles, gloriosus, is, sceledre, scelus, some, examples, stand, in, the, text, in, order, to, accentuate, and, emphasize, whatever, is, being, said, and, others, to, elevate, the, artistry, of, the, language, but, a, great, number, are, made, for, jokes, especially, riddle, jokes, which, feature, a, knock, knock, who, s, there, pattern, plautus, is, especially, fond, of, making, up, and, changing, the, meaning, of, words, as, shakespeare, does, later, further, emphasizing, and, elevating, the, artistry, of, the, language, of, the, plays, of, plautus, is, the, use, of, meter, which, simply, put, is, the, rhythm, of, the, play, there, seems, to, be, great, debate, over, whether, plautus, found, favour, in, strong, word, accent, or, verse, ictus, stress, plautus, did, not, follow, the, meter, of, the, greek, originals, that, he, adapted, for, the, roman, audience, plautus, used, a, great, number, of, meters, but, most, frequently, he, used, the, iambic, senarius, and, the, trochaic, septenarius, g, b, conte, has, noted, that, plautus, favours, the, use, of, cantica, instead, of, greek, meters, the, servus, callidus, functions, as, the, exposition, in, many, of, plautus, plays, according, to, c, stace, slaves, in, plautus, account, for, almost, twice, as, much, monologue, as, any, other, character, this, is, a, significant, statistic, most, of, the, monologues, being, as, they, are, for, purposes, of, humor, moralizing, or, exposition, of, some, kind, we, can, now, begin, to, see, the, true, nature, of, the, slave, s, importance, because, humor, vulgarity, and, incongruity, are, so, much, a, part, of, the, plautine, comedies, the, slave, becomes, the, essential, tool, to, connect, the, audience, to, the, joke, through, his, monologue, and, direct, connection, to, the, audience, he, is, then, not, only, a, source, for, exposition, and, understanding, but, connection, specifically, connection, to, the, humor, of, the, play, the, playfulness, of, the, play, the, servus, callidus, is, a, character, that, as, mccarthy, says, draws, the, complete, attention, of, the, audience, and, according, to, c, stace, despite, his, lies, and, abuse, claims, our, complete, sympathy, he, does, this, according, to, some, scholarship, using, monologue, the, imperative, mood, and, alliteration, all, of, which, are, specific, and, effective, linguistic, tools, in, both, writing, and, speaking, the, specific, type, of, monologue, or, soliloquy, in, which, a, plautine, slave, engages, is, the, prologue, as, opposed, to, simple, exposition, according, to, n, w, slater, these, prologues, have, a, far, more, important, function, than, merely, to, provide, information, another, way, in, which, the, servus, callidus, asserts, his, power, over, the, play, specifically, the, other, characters, in, the, play, is, through, his, use, of, the, imperative, mood, this, type, of, language, is, used, according, to, e, segal, for, the, forceful, inversion, the, reduction, of, the, master, to, an, abject, position, of, supplication, the, master, as, suppliant, is, thus, an, extremely, important, feature, of, the, plautine, comic, finale, the, imperative, mood, is, therefore, used, in, the, complete, role, reversal, of, the, normal, relationship, between, slave, and, master, and, those, who, enjoy, authority, and, respect, in, the, ordinary, roman, world, are, unseated, ridiculed, while, the, lowliest, members, of, society, mount, to, their, pedestals, the, humble, are, in, fact, exalted, meat, is, the, most, commonly, mentioned, foodstuff, in, the, plays, of, plautus, and, where, a, specific, meat, is, mentioned, it, is, most, commonly, pork, followed, by, fish, intellectual, and, academic, critics, have, often, judged, plautus, s, work, as, crude, yet, his, influence, on, later, literature, is, impressive, especially, on, two, literary, giants, shakespeare, and, moli, re, playwrights, throughout, history, have, looked, to, plautus, for, character, plot, humor, and, other, elements, of, comedy, his, influence, ranges, from, similarities, in, idea, to, full, literal, translations, woven, into, plays, the, playwright, s, apparent, familiarity, with, the, absurdity, of, humanity, and, both, the, comedy, and, tragedy, that, stem, from, this, absurdity, have, inspired, succeeding, playwrights, centuries, after, his, death, the, most, famous, of, these, successors, is, shakespeare, plautus, had, a, major, influence, on, his, early, comedies, plautus, was, apparently, read, in, the, 9th, century, his, form, was, too, complex, to, be, fully, understood, however, and, as, indicated, by, the, terentius, et, delusor, it, was, unknown, at, the, time, if, plautus, was, writing, in, prose, or, verse, w, b, sedgwick, has, provided, a, record, of, the, amphitruo, perennially, one, of, plautus, most, famous, works, it, was, the, most, popular, plautine, play, in, the, middle, ages, and, publicly, performed, at, the, renaissance, it, was, the, first, plautine, play, to, be, translated, into, english, the, influence, of, plautus, s, plays, was, felt, in, the, early, 16th, century, limited, records, suggest, that, the, first, known, university, production, of, plautus, in, england, was, of, miles, gloriosus, at, oxford, in, 1522, 3, the, magnum, jornale, of, queens, college, contains, a, reference, to, a, comoedia, plauti, in, either, 1522, or, 1523, this, fits, directly, with, comments, made, in, the, poems, of, leland, about, the, date, of, the, production, the, next, production, of, miles, gloriosus, that, is, known, from, limited, records, was, given, by, the, westminster, school, in, 1564, other, records, also, tell, us, about, performances, of, the, menaechmi, from, our, knowledge, performances, were, given, in, the, house, of, cardinal, wolsey, by, boys, of, st, paul, s, school, as, early, as, 1527, shakespeare, borrowed, from, plautus, as, plautus, borrowed, from, his, greek, models, according, to, c, l, barber, shakespeare, feeds, elizabethan, life, into, the, mill, of, roman, farce, life, realized, with, his, distinctively, generous, creativity, very, different, from, plautus, tough, narrow, resinous, genius, the, plautine, and, shakespearean, plays, that, most, parallel, each, other, are, respectively, the, menaechmi, and, the, comedy, of, errors, according, to, marples, shakespeare, drew, directly, from, plautus, parallels, in, plot, in, incident, and, in, character, and, was, undeniably, influenced, by, the, classical, playwright, s, work, h, a, watt, stresses, the, importance, of, recognizing, the, fact, that, the, two, plays, were, written, under, conditions, entirely, different, and, served, audiences, as, remote, as, the, poles, the, differences, between, the, menaechmi, and, the, comedy, of, errors, are, clear, in, the, menaechmi, plautus, uses, only, one, set, of, twins, twin, brothers, shakespeare, on, the, other, hand, uses, two, sets, of, twins, which, according, to, william, connolly, dilutes, the, force, of, situations, one, suggestion, is, that, shakespeare, got, this, idea, from, plautus, amphitruo, in, which, both, twin, masters, and, twin, slaves, appear, it, can, be, noted, that, the, doubling, is, a, stock, situation, of, elizabethan, comedy, on, the, fusion, between, elizabethan, and, plautine, techniques, t, w, baldwin, writes, errors, does, not, have, the, miniature, unity, of, menaechmi, which, is, characteristic, of, classic, structure, for, comedy, baldwin, notes, that, shakespeare, covers, a, much, greater, area, in, the, structure, of, the, play, than, plautus, does, shakespeare, was, writing, for, an, audience, whose, minds, weren, t, restricted, to, house, and, home, but, looked, toward, the, greater, world, beyond, and, the, role, that, they, might, play, in, that, world, another, difference, between, the, audiences, of, shakespeare, and, plautus, is, that, shakespeare, s, audience, was, christian, at, the, end, of, errors, the, world, of, the, play, is, returned, to, normal, when, a, christian, abbess, interferes, with, the, feuding, menaechmi, on, the, other, hand, is, almost, completely, lacking, in, a, supernatural, dimension, a, character, in, plautus, play, would, never, blame, an, inconvenient, situation, on, witchcraft, something, that, is, quite, common, in, shakespeare, the, relationship, between, a, master, and, a, clever, servant, is, also, a, common, element, in, elizabethan, comedy, shakespeare, often, includes, foils, for, his, characters, to, have, one, set, off, the, other, in, elizabethan, romantic, comedy, it, is, common, for, the, plays, to, end, with, multiple, marriages, and, couplings, of, pairs, this, is, something, that, is, not, seen, in, plautine, comedy, in, the, comedy, of, errors, aegeon, and, aemilia, are, separated, antipholus, and, adriana, are, at, odds, and, antipholus, and, luciana, have, not, yet, met, at, the, end, all, the, couples, are, happily, together, by, writing, his, comedies, in, a, combination, of, elizabethan, and, plautine, styles, shakespeare, helps, to, create, his, own, brand, of, comedy, one, that, uses, both, styles, also, shakespeare, uses, the, same, kind, of, opening, monologue, so, common, in, plautus, plays, he, even, uses, a, villain, in, the, comedy, of, errors, of, the, same, type, as, the, one, in, menaechmi, switching, the, character, from, a, doctor, to, a, teacher, but, keeping, the, character, a, shrewd, educated, man, watt, also, notes, that, some, of, these, elements, appear, in, many, of, his, works, such, as, twelfth, night, or, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, and, had, a, deep, impact, on, shakespeare, s, writing, later, playwrights, also, borrowed, plautus, stock, characters, one, of, the, most, important, echoes, of, plautus, is, the, stock, character, of, the, parasite, the, best, example, of, this, is, falstaff, shakespeare, s, portly, and, cowardly, knight, as, j, w, draper, notes, the, gluttonous, falstaff, shares, many, characteristics, with, a, parasite, such, as, artotrogus, from, miles, gloriosus, both, characters, seem, fixated, on, food, and, where, their, next, meal, is, coming, from, but, they, also, rely, on, flattery, in, order, to, gain, these, gifts, and, both, characters, are, willing, to, bury, their, patrons, in, empty, praise, draper, notes, that, falstaff, is, also, something, of, a, boastful, military, man, but, says, falstaff, is, so, complex, a, character, that, he, may, well, be, in, effect, a, combination, of, interlocking, types, as, well, as, appearing, in, shakespearean, comedy, the, plautine, parasite, appears, in, one, of, the, first, english, comedies, in, ralph, roister, doister, the, character, of, matthew, merrygreeke, follows, in, the, tradition, of, both, plautine, parasite, and, plautine, slave, as, he, both, searches, and, grovels, for, food, and, also, attempts, to, achieve, his, master, s, desires, indeed, the, play, itself, is, often, seen, as, borrowing, heavily, from, or, even, being, based, on, the, plautine, comedy, miles, gloriosus, h, w, cole, discusses, the, influence, of, plautus, and, terence, on, the, stonyhurst, pageants, the, stonyhurst, pageants, are, manuscripts, of, old, testament, plays, that, were, probably, composed, after, 1609, in, lancashire, cole, focuses, on, plautus, influence, on, the, particular, pageant, of, naaman, the, playwright, of, this, pageant, breaks, away, from, the, traditional, style, of, religious, medieval, drama, and, relies, heavily, on, the, works, of, plautus, overall, the, playwright, cross, references, eighteen, of, the, twenty, surviving, plays, of, plautus, and, five, of, the, six, extant, plays, by, terence, it, is, clear, that, the, author, of, the, stonyhurst, pageant, of, naaman, had, a, great, knowledge, of, plautus, and, was, significantly, influenced, by, this, there, is, evidence, of, plautine, imitation, in, edwardes, damon, and, pythias, and, heywood, s, silver, age, as, well, as, in, shakespeare, s, errors, heywood, sometimes, translated, whole, passages, of, plautus, by, being, translated, as, well, as, imitated, plautus, was, a, major, influence, on, comedy, of, the, elizabethan, era, in, terms, of, plot, or, perhaps, more, accurately, plot, device, plautus, served, as, a, source, of, inspiration, and, also, provided, the, possibility, of, adaptation, for, later, playwrights, the, many, deceits, that, plautus, layered, his, plays, with, giving, the, audience, the, feeling, of, a, genre, bordering, on, farce, appear, in, much, of, the, comedy, written, by, shakespeare, and, moli, re, for, instance, the, clever, slave, has, important, roles, in, both, l, avare, and, l, etourdi, two, plays, by, moli, re, and, in, both, drives, the, plot, and, creates, the, ruse, just, like, palaestrio, in, miles, gloriosus, these, similar, characters, set, up, the, same, kind, of, deceptions, in, which, many, of, plautus, plays, find, their, driving, force, which, is, not, a, simple, coincidence, 20th, century, musicals, based, on, plautus, include, a, funny, thing, happened, on, the, way, to, the, forum, larry, gelbart, and, burt, shevelove, book, stephen,
