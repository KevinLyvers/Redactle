part, of, the, cotswolds, near, stroud, visitors, were, shocked, by, orwell, s, appearance, and, concerned, by, the, shortcomings, and, ineffectiveness, of, the, treatment, friends, were, worried, about, his, finances, but, by, now, he, was, comparatively, well, off, he, was, writing, to, many, of, his, friends, including, jacintha, buddicom, who, had, rediscovered, him, and, in, march, 1949, was, visited, by, celia, kirwan, kirwan, had, just, started, working, for, a, foreign, office, unit, the, information, research, department, ird, set, up, by, the, labour, government, to, publish,

of, nineteen, eighty, four, sonia, took, charge, of, orwell, s, affairs, and, attended, him, diligently, in, the, hospital, friends, of, orwell, stated, that, brownell, helped, him, through, the, painful, last, months, of, his, life, and, according, to, anthony, powell, cheered, orwell, up, greatly, however, others, have, argued, that, she, may, have, been, attracted, to, him, primarily, because, of, his, fame, in, september, 1949, orwell, invited, his, accountant, jack, harrison, to, visit, him, at, the, hospital, and, harrison, claimed, that, orwell, then, asked, him, to, become, director, of, gop, ltd, and, to, manage, the, company, but, there, was, no, independent, witness, orwell, s, wedding, took, place, in, the, hospital, room, on, 13, october, 1949, with, david, astor, as, best, man, further, meetings, were, held, with, his, accountant, at, which, harrison, and, mr, and, mrs, blair, were, confirmed, as, directors, of, the, company, orwell, s, health, was, in, decline, again, by, christmas, jack, harrison, visited, later, and, claimed, that, orwell, gave, him, 25, of, the, company, early, on, the, morning, of, 21, january, an, artery, burst, in, orwell, s, lungs, killing, him, at, the, age, of, 46, orwell, had, requested, to, be, buried, in, accordance, with, the, anglican, rite, in, the, graveyard, of, the, closest, church, to, wherever, he, happened, to, die, the, graveyards, in, central, london, had, no, space, and, so, in, an, effort, to, ensure, his, last, wishes, could, be, fulfilled, his, widow, appealed, to, his, friends, to, see, whether, any, of, them, knew, of, a, church, with, space, in, its, graveyard, david, astor, arranged, for, orwell, to, be, interred, in, the, churchyard, of, all, saints, in, sutton, courtenay, the, funeral, was, organised, by, anthony, powell, and, malcom, muggeridge, powell, chose, the, hymns, all, people, that, on, earth, do, dwell, guide, me, o, thou, great, redeemer, and, ten, thousand, times, ten, thousand, orwell, s, adopted, son, richard, horatio, blair, was, brought, up, by, orwell, s, sister, avril, his, legal, guardian, and, her, husband, bill, dunn, in, 1979, sonia, brownell, brought, a, high, court, action, against, harrison, when, he, declared, an, intention, to, subdivide, his, 25, per, cent, share, of, the, company, between, his, three, children, for, sonia, the, consequence, of, this, manoeuvre, would, have, made, getting, overall, control, of, the, company, three, times, more, difficult, she, was, considered, to, have, a, strong, case, but, was, becoming, increasingly, ill, and, eventually, was, persuaded, to, settle, out, of, court, on, 2, november, 1980, she, died, on, 11, december, 1980, aged, 62, during, most, of, his, career, orwell, was, best, known, for, his, journalism, in, essays, reviews, columns, in, newspapers, and, magazines, and, in, his, books, of, reportage, down, and, out, in, paris, and, london, describing, a, period, of, poverty, in, these, cities, the, road, to, wigan, pier, describing, the, living, conditions, of, the, poor, in, northern, england, and, class, division, generally, and, homage, to, catalonia, according, to, irving, howe, orwell, was, the, best, english, essayist, since, hazlitt, perhaps, since, dr, johnson, modern, readers, are, more, often, introduced, to, orwell, as, a, novelist, particularly, through, his, enormously, successful, animal, farm, and, nineteen, eighty, four, the, former, is, often, thought, to, reflect, degeneration, in, the, soviet, union, after, the, russian, revolution, and, the, rise, of, stalinism, the, latter, life, under, totalitarian, rule, in, 1984, nineteen, eighty, four, and, ray, bradbury, s, fahrenheit, 451, were, honoured, with, the, prometheus, award, for, their, contributions, to, dystopian, literature, in, 2011, he, received, it, again, for, animal, farm, in, 2003, nineteen, eighty, four, was, listed, at, number, 8, and, animal, farm, at, number, 46, on, the, bbc, s, the, big, read, poll, in, 2021, readers, of, the, new, york, times, book, review, rated, nineteen, eighty, four, third, in, a, list, of, the, best, books, of, the, past, 125, years, in, an, autobiographical, piece, that, orwell, sent, to, the, editors, of, twentieth, century, authors, in, 1940, he, wrote, the, writers, i, care, about, most, and, never, grow, tired, of, are, shakespeare, swift, fielding, dickens, charles, reade, flaubert, and, among, modern, writers, james, joyce, t, s, eliot, and, d, h, lawrence, but, i, believe, the, modern, writer, who, has, influenced, me, most, is, w, somerset, maugham, whom, i, admire, immensely, for, his, power, of, telling, a, story, straightforwardly, and, without, frills, elsewhere, orwell, strongly, praised, the, works, of, jack, london, especially, his, book, the, road, orwell, s, investigation, of, poverty, in, the, road, to, wigan, pier, strongly, resembles, that, of, jack, london, s, the, people, of, the, abyss, in, which, the, american, journalist, disguises, himself, as, an, out, of, work, sailor, to, investigate, the, lives, of, the, poor, in, london, in, his, essay, politics, vs, literature, an, examination, of, gulliver, s, travels, 1946, orwell, wrote, if, i, had, to, make, a, list, of, six, books, which, were, to, be, preserved, when, all, others, were, destroyed, i, would, certainly, put, gulliver, s, travels, among, them, on, h, g, wells, he, wrote, the, minds, of, all, of, us, and, therefore, the, physical, world, would, be, perceptibly, different, if, wells, had, never, existed, orwell, was, an, admirer, of, arthur, koestler, and, became, a, close, friend, during, the, three, years, that, koestler, and, his, wife, mamain, spent, at, the, cottage, of, bwlch, ocyn, in, the, vale, of, ffestiniog, orwell, reviewed, koestler, s, darkness, at, noon, for, the, new, statesman, in, 1941, saying, brilliant, as, this, book, is, as, a, novel, and, a, piece, of, brilliant, literature, it, is, probably, most, valuable, as, an, interpretation, of, the, moscow, confessions, by, someone, with, an, inner, knowledge, of, totalitarian, methods, what, was, frightening, about, these, trials, was, not, the, fact, that, they, happened, for, obviously, such, things, are, necessary, in, a, totalitarian, society, but, the, eagerness, of, western, intellectuals, to, justify, them, other, writers, orwell, admired, included, ralph, waldo, emerson, george, gissing, graham, greene, herman, melville, henry, miller, tobias, smollett, mark, twain, joseph, conrad, and, yevgeny, zamyatin, he, was, both, an, admirer, and, a, critic, of, rudyard, kipling, praising, kipling, as, a, gifted, writer, and, a, good, bad, poet, whose, work, is, spurious, and, morally, insensitive, and, aesthetically, disgusting, but, undeniably, seductive, and, able, to, speak, to, certain, aspects, of, reality, more, effectively, than, more, enlightened, authors, he, had, a, similarly, ambivalent, attitude, to, g, k, chesterton, whom, he, regarded, as, a, writer, of, considerable, talent, who, had, chosen, to, devote, himself, to, roman, catholic, propaganda, and, to, evelyn, waugh, who, was, he, wrote, about, as, good, a, novelist, as, one, can, be, i, e, as, novelists, go, today, while, holding, untenable, opinions, throughout, his, life, orwell, continually, supported, himself, as, a, book, reviewer, his, reviews, are, well, known, and, have, had, an, influence, on, literary, criticism, he, wrote, in, the, conclusion, to, his, 1940, essay, on, charles, dickens, when, one, reads, any, strongly, individual, piece, of, writing, one, has, the, impression, of, seeing, a, face, somewhere, behind, the, page, it, is, not, necessarily, the, actual, face, of, the, writer, i, feel, this, very, strongly, with, swift, with, defoe, with, fielding, stendhal, thackeray, flaubert, though, in, several, cases, i, do, not, know, what, these, people, looked, like, and, do, not, want, to, know, what, one, sees, is, the, face, that, the, writer, ought, to, have, well, in, the, case, of, dickens, i, see, a, face, that, is, not, quite, the, face, of, dickens, s, photographs, though, it, resembles, it, it, is, the, face, of, a, man, of, about, forty, with, a, small, beard, and, a, high, colour, he, is, laughing, with, a, touch, of, anger, in, his, laughter, but, no, triumph, no, malignity, it, is, the, face, of, a, man, who, is, always, fighting, against, something, but, who, fights, in, the, open, and, is, not, frightened, the, face, of, a, man, who, is, generously, angry, in, other, words, of, a, nineteenth, century, liberal, a, free, intelligence, a, type, hated, with, equal, hatred, by, all, the, smelly, little, orthodoxies, which, are, now, contending, for, our, souls, george, woodcock, suggested, that, the, last, two, sentences, also, describe, orwell, orwell, wrote, a, critique, of, george, bernard, shaw, s, play, arms, and, the, man, he, considered, this, shaw, s, best, play, and, the, most, likely, to, remain, socially, relevant, his, 1945, essay, in, defence, of, p, g, wodehouse, argues, that, his, broadcasts, from, germany, during, the, war, did, not, really, make, him, a, traitor, he, accused, the, ministry, of, information, of, exaggerating, wodehouse, s, actions, for, propaganda, purposes, in, 1946, the, british, council, commissioned, orwell, to, write, an, essay, on, british, food, as, part, of, a, drive, to, promote, british, relations, abroad, in, his, essay, titled, british, cookery, orwell, described, the, british, diet, as, a, simple, rather, heavy, perhaps, slightly, barbarous, diet, and, where, hot, drinks, are, acceptable, at, most, hours, of, the, day, he, wrote, that, high, tea, in, the, united, kingdom, consisted, of, a, variety, of, savoury, and, sweet, dishes, but, no, tea, would, be, considered, a, good, one, if, it, did, not, include, at, least, one, kind, of, cake, before, adding, as, well, as, cakes, biscuits, are, much, eaten, at, tea, time, orwell, included, his, own, recipe, for, marmalade, a, popular, british, spread, on, toast, however, the, british, council, declined, to, publish, the, essay, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, too, problematic, to, write, about, food, at, the, time, of, strict, rationing, in, the, uk, following, the, war, in, 2019, the, essay, was, discovered, in, the, british, council, s, archives, along, with, the, rejection, letter, the, british, council, issued, an, official, apology, to, orwell, over, the, rejection, of, the, commissioned, essay, publishing, the, original, essay, along, with, the, rejection, letter, arthur, koestler, said, that, orwell, s, uncompromising, intellectual, honesty, made, him, appear, almost, inhuman, at, times, ben, wattenberg, stated, orwell, s, writing, pierced, intellectual, hypocrisy, wherever, he, found, it, according, to, historian, piers, brendon, orwell, was, the, saint, of, common, decency, who, would, in, earlier, days, said, his, bbc, boss, rushbrook, williams, have, been, either, canonised, or, burnt, at, the, stake, raymond, williams, in, politics, and, letters, interviews, with, new, left, review, describes, orwell, as, a, successful, impersonation, of, a, plain, man, who, bumps, into, experience, in, an, unmediated, way, and, tells, the, truth, about, it, christopher, norris, declared, that, orwell, s, homespun, empiricist, outlook, his, assumption, that, the, truth, was, just, there, to, be, told, in, a, straightforward, common, sense, way, now, seems, not, merely, na, ve, but, culpably, self, deluding, the, american, scholar, scott, lucas, has, described, orwell, as, an, enemy, of, the, left, john, newsinger, has, argued, that, lucas, could, only, do, this, by, portraying, all, of, orwell, s, attacks, on, stalinism, as, if, they, were, attacks, on, socialism, despite, orwell, s, continued, insistence, that, they, were, not, orwell, s, work, has, taken, a, prominent, place, in, the, school, literature, curriculum, in, england, with, animal, farm, a, regular, examination, topic, at, the, end, of, secondary, education, gcse, and,

historian, john, rodden, stated, john, podhoretz, did, claim, that, if, orwell, were, alive, today, he, d, be, standing, with, the, neo, conservatives, and, against, the, left, and, the, question, arises, to, what, extent, can, you, even, begin, to, predict, the, political, positions, of, somebody, who, s, been, dead, three, decades, and, more, by, that, time, john, rodden, points, out, the, undeniable, conservative, features, in, the, orwell, physiognomy, and, remarks, on, how, to, some, extent, orwell, facilitated, the, kinds, of, uses, and, abuses, by, the, right, that, his, name, has, been, put, to, in, other, ways, there, has, been, the, politics, of, selective, quotation, rodden, refers, to, the, essay, why, i, write, in, which, orwell, refers, to, the, spanish, civil, war, as,

goes, on, to, explain, how, during, the, mccarthy, era, the, introduction, to, the, signet, edition, of, animal, farm, makes, use, of, selective, quotation, if, the, book, itself, animal, farm, had, left, any, doubt, of, the, matter, orwell, dispelled, it, in, his, essay, why, i, write, every, line, of, serious, work, that, i, ve, written, since, 1936, has, been, written, directly, or, indirectly, against, totalitarianism, dot, dot, dot, dot, the, politics, of, ellipsis, for, democratic, socialism, is, vaporized, just, like, winston, smith, did, it, at, the, ministry, of, truth,

was, his, struggle, to, turn, himself, into, a, writer, one, which, led, through, long, periods, of, poverty, failure, and, humiliation, and, about, which, he, has, written, almost, nothing, directly, the, sweat, and, agony, was, less, in, the, slum, life, than, in, the, effort, to, turn, the, experience, into, literature, conversely, historian, isaac, deutscher, was, far, more, critical, of, orwell, from, a, marxist, perspective, and, characterised, him, as, a, simple, minded, anarchist, deutscher, argued, that, orwell, had, struggled, to, comprehend, the, dialectical, philosophy, of, marxism, demonstrated, personal, ambivalence, towards, other, strands, of, socialism, and, his, works, such, as, nineteen, eighty, four, had, been, appropriated, for, the, purpose, of, anti, communist, cold, war, propaganda, in, his, essay, politics, and, the, english, language, 1946, orwell, wrote, about, the, importance, of, precise, and, clear, language, arguing, that, vague, writing, can, be, used, as, a, powerful, tool, of, political, manipulation, in, that, essay, orwell, provides, six, rules, for, writers, orwell, worked, as, a, journalist, at, the, observer, for, seven, years, and, its, editor, david, astor, gave, a, copy, of, this, celebrated, essay, to, every, new, recruit, in, 2003, literary, editor, at, the, newspaper, robert, mccrum, wrote, even, now, it, is, quoted, in, our, style, book, journalist, jonathan, heawood, noted, orwell, s, criticism, of, slovenly, language, is, still, taken, very, seriously, andrew, n, rubin, argues, that, orwell, claimed, that, we, should, be, attentive, to, how, the, use, of, language, has, limited, our, capacity, for, critical, thought, just, as, we, should, be, equally, concerned, with, the, ways, in, which, dominant, modes, of, thinking, have, reshaped, the, very, language, that, we, use, the, adjective, orwellian, connotes, an, attitude, and, a, policy, of, control, by, propaganda, surveillance, misinformation, denial,

buddicoms, i, do, not, think, he, needed, any, other, friends, beyond, the, schoolfriend, he, occasionally, and, appreciatively, referred, to, as, cc, she, could, not, recall, him, having, schoolfriends, to, stay, and, exchange, visits, as, her, brother, prosper, often, did, in, holidays, cyril, connolly, provides, an, account, of, blair, as, a, child, in, enemies, of, promise, years, later, blair, mordantly, recalled, his, prep, school, in, the, essay, such, such, were, the, joys, claiming, among, other, things, that, he, was, made, to, study, like, a, dog, to, earn, a, scholarship, jacintha, buddicom, repudiated, orwell, s, schoolboy, misery, described, in, the, essay, stating, that, he, was, a, specially, happy, child, she, noted, that, he, did, not, like, his, name, because, it, reminded, him, of, a, book, he, greatly, disliked, eric, or, little, by, little, a, victorian, boys, school, story, connolly, remarked, of, him, as, a, schoolboy, the, remarkable, thing, about, orwell, was, that, alone, among, the, boys, he, was, an, intellectual, and, not, a, parrot, for, he, thought, for, himself, at, eton, john, vaughan, wilkes, his, former, headmaster, s, son, at, st, cyprians, recalled, that, he, was, extremely, argumentative, about, anything, and, criticising, the, masters, and, criticising, the, other, boys, we, enjoyed, arguing, with, him, he, would, generally, win, the, arguments, or, think, he, had, anyhow, blair, liked, to, carry, out, practical, jokes, buddicom, recalls, him, swinging, from, the, luggage, rack, in, a, railway, carriage, like, an, orangutan, to, frighten, a, woman, passenger, out, of, the, compartment, at, eton, he, played, tricks, on, john, crace, his, housemaster, among, which, was, to, enter, a, spoof, advertisement, in, a, college, magazine, implying, pederasty, gow, his, tutor, said, he, made, himself, as, big, a, nuisance, as, he, could, and, was, a, very, unattractive, boy, later, blair, was, expelled, from, the, crammer, at, southwold, for, sending, a, dead, rat, as, a, birthday, present, to, the, town, surveyor, blair, had, an, interest, in, natural, history, which, stemmed, from, his, childhood, in, letters, from, school, he, wrote, about, caterpillars, and, butterflies, and, buddicom, recalls, his, keen, interest, in, ornithology, he, also, enjoyed, fishing, and, shooting, rabbits, and, conducting, experiments, as, in, cooking, a, hedgehog, or, shooting, down, a, jackdaw, from, the, eton, roof, to, dissect, it, his, zeal, for, scientific, experiments, extended, to, explosives, again, buddicom, recalls, a, cook, giving, notice, because, of, the, noise, later, in, southwold, his, sister, avril, recalled, him, blowing, up, the, garden, when, teaching, he, enthused, his, students, with, his, nature, rambles, both, at, southwold, and, at, hayes, his, adult, diaries, are, permeated, with, his, observations, on, nature, buddicom, and, blair, lost, touch, shortly, after, he, went, to, burma, and, she, became, unsympathetic, towards, him, she, wrote, that, it, was, because, of, the, letters, he, wrote, complaining, about, his, life, but, an, addendum, to, eric, us, by, venables, reveals, that, he, may, have, lost, her, sympathy, through, an, incident, which, could, be, categorised, as, attempted, rape, where, she, ran, home, with, a, torn, skirt, and, a, bruised, hip, mabel, fierz, who, later, became, blair, s, confidante, said, he, used, to, say, the, one, thing, he, wished, in, this, world, was, that, he, d, been, attractive, to, women, he, liked, women, and, had, many, girlfriends, i, think, in, burma, he, had, a, girl, in, southwold, and, another, girl, in, london, he, was, rather, a, womaniser, yet, he, was, afraid, he, wasn, t, attractive, brenda, salkield, southwold, preferred, friendship, to, any, deeper, relationship, and, maintained, a, correspondence, with, blair, for, many, years, particularly, as, a, sounding, board, for, his, ideas, she, wrote, he, was, a, great, letter, writer, endless, letters, and, i, mean, when, he, wrote, you, a, letter, he, wrote, pages, his, correspondence, with, eleanor, jacques, london, was, more, prosaic, dwelling, on, a, closer, relationship, and, referring, to, past, rendezvous, or, planning, future, ones, in, london, and, burnham, beeches, when, orwell, was, in, the, sanatorium, in, kent, his, wife, eileen, s, friend, lydia, jackson, visited, he, invited, her, for, a, walk, and, out, of, sight, an, awkward, situation, arose, jackson, was, to, be, the, most, critical, of, orwell, s, marriage, to, eileen, but, their, later, correspondence, hints, at, a, complicity, at, the, time, eileen, was, more, concerned, about, orwell, s, closeness, to, brenda, salkield, orwell, had, an, affair, with, his, secretary, at, tribune, which, caused, eileen, much, distress, and, others, have, been, mooted, in, a, letter, to, ann, popham, he, wrote, i, was, sometimes, unfaithful, to, eileen, and, i, also, treated, her, badly, and, i, think, she, treated, me, badly, too, at, times, but, it, was, a, real, marriage, in, the, sense, that, we, had, been, through, awful, struggles, together, and, she, understood, all, about, my, work, etc, similarly, he, suggested, to, celia, kirwan, that, they, had, both, been, unfaithful, there, are, several, testaments, that, it, was, a, well, matched, and, happy, marriage, in, june, 1944, orwell, and, eileen, adopted, a, three, week, old, boy, they, named, richard, horatio, according, to, richard, orwell, was, a, wonderful, father, who, gave, him, devoted, if, rather, rugged, attention, and, a, great, degree, of, freedom, orwell, was, very, lonely, after, eileen, s, death, in, 1945, and, was, desperate, for, a, wife, both, as, companion, for, himself, and, as, mother, for, richard, he, proposed, marriage, to, four, women, including, celia, kirwan, and, eventually, sonia, brownell, accepted, orwell, had, met, her, when, she, was, assistant, to, cyril, connolly, at, horizon, literary, magazine, they, were, married, on, 13, october, 1949, only, three, months, before, orwell, s, death, some, maintain, that, sonia, was, the, model, for, julia, in, nineteen, eighty, four, orwell, was, noted, for, very, close, and, enduring, friendships, with, a, few, friends, but, these, were, generally, people, with, a, similar, background, or, with, a, similar, level, of, literary, ability, ungregarious, he, was, out, of, place, in, a, crowd, and, his, discomfort, was, exacerbated, when, he, was, outside, his, own, class, though, representing, himself, as, a, spokesman, for, the, common, man, he, often, appeared, out, of, place, with, real, working, people, his, brother, in, law, humphrey, dakin, a, hail, fellow, well, met, type, who, took, him, to, a, local, pub, in, leeds, said, that, he, was, told, by, the, landlord, don, t, bring, that, bugger, in, here, again, adrian, fierz, commented, he, wasn, t, interested, in, racing, or, greyhounds, or, pub, crawling, or, shove, ha, penny, he, just, did, not, have, much, in, common, with, people, who, did, not, share, his, intellectual, interests, awkwardness, attended, many, of, his, encounters, with, working, class, representatives, as, with, pollitt, and, mcnair, but, his, courtesy, and, good, manners, were, often, commented, on, jack, common, observed, on, meeting, him, for, the, first, time, right, away, manners, and, more, than, manners, breeding, showed, through, in, his, tramping, days, he, did, domestic, work, for, a, time, his, extreme, politeness, was, recalled, by, a, member, of, the, family, he, worked, for, she, declared, that, the, family, referred, to, him, as, laurel, after, the, film, comedian, with, his, gangling, figure, and, awkwardness, orwell, s, friends, often, saw, him, as, a, figure, of, fun, geoffrey, gorer, commented, he, was, awfully, likely, to, knock, things, off, tables, trip, over, things, i, mean, he, was, a, gangling, physically, badly, co, ordinated, young, man, i, think, his, feeling, that, even, the, inanimate, world, was, against, him, at, the, bbc, in, the, 1940s, everybody, would, pull, his, leg, and, spender, described, him, as, having, real, entertainment, value, like, as, i, say, watching, a, charlie, chaplin, movie, a, friend, of, eileen, s, reminisced, about, her, tolerance, and, humour, often, at, orwell, s, expense, one, biography, of, orwell, accused, him, of, having, had, an, authoritarian, streak, one, of, his, former, pupils, recalled, being, beaten, so, hard, he, could, not, sit, down, for, a, week, when, sharing, a, flat, with, orwell, heppenstall, came, home, late, one, night, in, an, advanced, stage, of, loud, inebriation, the, upshot, was, that, heppenstall, ended, up, with, a, bloody, nose, and, was, locked, in, a, room, when, he, complained, orwell, hit, him, across, the, legs, with, a, shooting, stick, and, heppenstall, then, had, to, defend, himself, with, a, chair, years, later, after, orwell, s, death, heppenstall, wrote, a, dramatic, account, of, the, incident, called, the, shooting, stick, orwell, got, on, well, with, young, people, the, pupil, he, beat, considered, him, the, best, of, teachers, and, the, young, recruits, in, barcelona, tried, to, drink, him, under, the, table, without, success, in, the, wake, of, his, most, famous, works, he, attracted, many, uncritical, hangers, on, but, many, others, who, sought, him, found, him, aloof, and, even, dull, with, his, soft, voice, he, was, sometimes, shouted, down, or, excluded, from, discussions, at, this, time, he, was, severely, ill, it, was, wartime, or, the, austerity, period, after, it, during, the, war, his, wife, suffered, from, depression, and, after, her, death, he, was, lonely, and, unhappy, in, addition, to, that, he, always, lived, frugally, and, seemed, unable, to, care, for, himself, properly, as, a, result, of, all, this, people, found, his, circumstances, bleak, some, like, michael, ayrton, called, him, gloomy, george, but, others, developed, the, idea, that, he, was, an, english, secular, saint, orwell, was, a, heavy, smoker, who, rolled, his, own, cigarettes, from, strong, shag, tobacco, despite, his, bronchial, condition, his, penchant, for, the, rugged, life, often, took, him, to, cold, and, damp, situations, described, by, the, economist, as, perhaps, the, 20th, century, s, best, chronicler, of, english, culture, orwell, considered, fish, and, chips, football, the, pub, strong, tea, cut, price, chocolate, the, movies, and, radio, among, the, chief, comforts, for, the, working, class, he, advocated, a, patriotic, defence, of, a, british, way, of, life, that, could, not, be, trusted, to, intellectuals, or, by, implication, the, state, we, are, a, nation, of, flower, lovers, but, also, a, nation, of, stamp, collectors, pigeon, fanciers, amateur, carpenters, coupon, snippers, darts, players, crossword, puzzle, fans, all, the, culture, that, is, most,

liberty, of, the, individual, is, still, believed, in, almost, as, in, the, nineteenth, century, but, this, has, nothing, to, do, with, economic, liberty, the, right, to, exploit, others, for, profit, it, is, the, liberty, to, have, a, home, of, your, own, to, do, what, you, like, in, your, spare, time, to, choose, your, own, amusements, instead, of, having, them, chosen, for, you, from, above, by, putting, the, tea, in, first, and, stirring, as, one, pours, one, can, exactly, regulate, the, amount, of, milk, whereas, one, is, likely, to, put, in, too, much, milk, if, one, does, it, the, other, way, round, one, of, orwell, s, eleven, rules, for, making, tea, from, his, essay, a, nice, cup, of, tea, which, appeared, in, the, london, evening, standard, 12, january, 1946, orwell, enjoyed, strong, tea, he, had, fortnum, mason, s, tea, brought, to, him, in, catalonia, his, 1946, essay, a, nice, cup, of, tea, appeared, in, the, london, evening, standard, article, on, how, to, make, tea, he, appreciated, english, beer, taken, regularly, and, moderately, despised, drinkers, of, lager, and, wrote, about, an, imagined, ideal, british, pub, in, his, 1946, evening, standard, article, the, moon, under, water, not, as, particular, about, food, he, enjoyed, the, wartime, victory, pie, and, extolled, canteen, food, at, the, bbc, he, preferred, traditional, english, dishes, such, as, roast, beef, and, kippers, his, dress, sense, was, unpredictable, and, usually, casual, in, southwold, he, had, the, best, cloth, from, the, local, tailor, but, was, equally, happy, in, his, tramping, outfit, his, attire, in, the, spanish, civil, war, along, with, his, size, 12, boots, was, a, source, of, amusement, david, astor, described, him, as, looking, like, a, prep, school, master, while, according, to, the, special, branch, dossier, orwell, s, tendency, to, dress, in, bohemian, fashion, revealed, that, the, author, was, a, communist, orwell, s, confusing, approach, to, matters, of, social, decorum, on, the, one, hand, expecting, a, working, class, guest, to, dress, for, dinner, and, on, the, other, slurping, tea, out, of, a, saucer, at, the, bbc, canteen, helped, stoke, his, reputation, as, an, english, eccentric, orwell, was, an, atheist, who, identified, himself, with, the, humanist, outlook, on, life, despite, this, and, despite, his, criticisms, of, both, religious, doctrine, and, religious, organisations, he, nevertheless, regularly, participated, in, the, social, and, civic, life, of, the, church, including, by, attending, church, of, england, holy, communion, acknowledging, this, contradiction, he, once, said, it, seems, rather, mean, to, go, to, hc, when, one, doesn, t, believe, but, i, have, passed, myself, off, for, pious, there, is, nothing, for, it, but, to, keep, up, with, the, deception, he, had, two, anglican, marriages, and, left, instructions, for, an, anglican, funeral, orwell, was, also, well, read, in, biblical, literature, and, could, quote, lengthy, passages, from, the, book, of, common, prayer, from, memory, his, extensive, knowledge, of, the, bible, came, coupled, with, unsparing, criticism, of, its, philosophy, and, as, an, adult, he, could, not, bring, himself, to, believe, in, its, tenets, he, said, in, part, v, of, his, essay, such, such, were, the, joys, that, till, about, the, age, of, fourteen, i, believed, in, god, and, believed, that, the, accounts, given, of, him, were, true, but, i, was, well, aware, that, i, did, not, love, him, orwell, directly, contrasted, christianity, with, secular, humanism, in, his, essay, lear, tolstoy, and, the, fool, finding, the, latter, philosophy, more, palatable, and, less, self, interested, literary, critic, james, wood, wrote, that, in, the, struggle, as, he, saw, it, between, christianity, and, humanism, orwell, was, on, the, humanist, side, of, course, orwell, s, writing, was, often, explicitly, critical, of, religion, and, christianity, in, particular, he, found, the, church, to, be, a, selfish, church, of, the, landed, gentry, with, its, establishment, out, of, touch, with, the, majority, of, its, communicants, and, altogether, a, pernicious, influence, on, public, life, his, contradictory, and, sometimes, ambiguous, views, about, the, social, benefits, of, religious, affiliation, mirrored, the, dichotomies, between, his, public, and, private, lives, stephen, ingle, wrote, that, it, was, as, if, the, writer, george, orwell, vaunted, his, unbelief, while, eric, blair, the, individual, retained, a, deeply, ingrained, religiosity, orwell, liked, to, provoke, arguments, by, challenging, the, status, quo, but, he, was, also, a, traditionalist, with, a, love, of, old, english, values, he, criticised, and, satirised, from, the, inside, the, various, social, milieux, in, which, he, found, himself, in, his, adelphi, days, he, described, himself, as, a, tory, anarchist, of, colonialism, in, burmese, days, he, portrays, the, english, colonists, as, a, dull, decent, people, cherishing, and, fortifying, their, dullness, behind, a, quarter, of, a, million, bayonets, writing, for, le, progr, s, civique, orwell, described, the, british, colonial, government, in, burma, and, india, the, government, of, all, the, indian, provinces, under, the, control, of, the, british, empire, is, of, necessity, despotic, because, only, the, threat, of, force, can, subdue, a, population, of, several, million, subjects, but, this, despotism, is, latent, it, hides, behind, a, mask, of, democracy, care, is, taken, to, avoid, technical, and, industrial, training, this, rule, observed, throughout, india, aims, to, stop, india, from, becoming, an, industrial, country, capable, of, competing, with, england, foreign, competition, is, prevented, by, an, insuperable, barrier, of, prohibitive, customs, tariffs, and, so, the, english, factory, owners, with, nothing, to, fear, control, the, markets, absolutely, and, reap, exorbitant, profits, the, spanish, civil, war, played, the, most, important, part, in, defining, orwell, s, socialism, he, wrote, to, cyril, connolly, from, barcelona, on, 8, june, 1937, i, have, seen, wonderful, things, and, at, last, really, believe, in, socialism, which, i, never, did, before, having, witnessed, anarcho, syndicalist, communities, and, the, subsequent, brutal, suppression, of, the, anarcho, syndicalists, anti, stalin, communist, parties, and, revolutionaries, by, the, soviet, union, backed, communists, orwell, returned, from, catalonia, a, staunch, anti, stalinist, and, joined, the, british, independent, labour, party, in, part, 2, of, the, road, to, wigan, pier, published, by, the, left, book, club, orwell, stated, that, a, real, socialist, is, one, who, wishes, not, merely, conceives, it, as, desirable, but, actively, wishes, to, see, tyranny, overthrown, orwell, stated, in, why, i, write, 1946, every, line, of, serious, work, that, i, have, written, since, 1936, has, been, written, directly, or, indirectly, against, totalitarianism, and, for, democratic, socialism, as, i, understand, it, orwell, s, conception, of, socialism, was, of, a, planned, economy, alongside, democracy, orwell, was, a, proponent, of, a, federal, socialist, europe, a, position, outlined, in, his, 1947, essay, toward, european, unity, which, first, appeared, in, partisan, review, according, to, biographer, john, newsinger, the, other, crucial, dimension, to, orwell, s, socialism, was, his, recognition, that, the, soviet, union, was, not, socialist, unlike, many, on, the, left, instead, of, abandoning, socialism, once, he, discovered, the, full, horror, of, stalinist, rule, in, the, soviet, union, orwell, abandoned, the, soviet, union, and, instead, remained, a, socialist, indeed, he, became, more, committed, to, the, socialist, cause, than, ever, orwell, was, opposed, to, rearmament, against, nazi, germany, and, at, the, time, of, the, munich, agreement, he, signed, a, manifesto, entitled, if, war, comes, we, shall, resist, but, he, changed, his, view, after, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, and, the, outbreak, of, the, war, he, left, the, ilp, because, of, its, opposition, to, the, war, and, adopted, a, political, position, of, revolutionary, patriotism, on, 21, march, 1940, he, wrote, a, review, of, adolf, hitler, s, mein, kampf, for, the, new, english, weekly, in, which, he, analysed, the, dictator, s, psychology, asking, how, was, it, that, he, was, able, to, put, monstrous, vision, across, orwell, tried, to, understand, why, hitler, was, worshipped, by, the, german, people, the, situation, in, germany, with, its, seven, million, unemployed, was, obviously, favourable, for, demagogues, but, hitler, could, not, have, succeeded, against, his, many, rivals, if, it, had, not, been, for, the, attraction, of, his, own, personality, which, one, can, feel, even, in, the, clumsy, writing, of, mein, kampf, and, which, is, no, doubt, overwhelming, when, one, hears, his, speeches, the, fact, is, that, there, is, something, deeply, appealing, about, him, the, initial, personal, cause, of, his, grievance, against, the, universe, can, only, be, guessed, at, but, at, any, rate, the, grievance, is, here, he, is, the, martyr, the, victim, prometheus, chained, to, the, rock, the, self, sacrificing, hero, who, fights, single, handed, against, impossible, odds, if, he, were, killing, a, mouse, he, would, know, how, to, make, it, seem, like, a, dragon, in, december, 1940, he, wrote, in, tribune, the, labour, left, s, weekly, we, are, in, a, strange, period, of, history, in, which, a, revolutionary, has, to, be, a, patriot, and, a, patriot, has, to, be, a, revolutionary, during, the, war, orwell, was, highly, critical, of, the, popular, idea, that, an, anglo, soviet, alliance, would, be, the, basis, of, a, post, war, world, of, peace, and, prosperity, in, his, reply, dated, 15, november, 1943, to, an, invitation, from, the, duchess, of, atholl, to, speak, for, the, british, league, for, european, freedom, he, stated, that, he, could, not, associate, himself, with, an, essentially, conservative, body, that, claimed, to, defend, democracy, in, europe, but, had, nothing, to, say, about, british, imperialism, his, closing, paragraph, stated, i, belong, to, the, left, and, must, work, inside, it, much, as, i, hate, russian, totalitarianism, and, its, poisonous, influence, in, this, country, orwell, joined, the, staff, of, tribune, magazine, as, literary, editor, and, from, then, until, his, death, was, a, left, wing, though, hardly, orthodox, labour, supporting, democratic, socialist, on, 1, september, 1944, writing, about, the, warsaw, uprising, orwell, expressed, in, tribune, his, hostility, against, the, influence, of, the, alliance, with, the, ussr, over, the, allies, do, remember, that, dishonesty, and, cowardice, always, have, to, be, paid, for, do, not, imagine, that, for, years, on, end, you, can, make, yourself, the, boot, licking, propagandist, of, the, sovietic, regime, or, any, other, regime, and, then, suddenly, return, to, honesty, and, reason, once, a, whore, always, a, whore, according, to, newsinger, although, orwell, was, always, critical, of, the, 1945, 51, labour, government, s, moderation, his, support, for, it, began, to, pull, him, to, the, right, politically, this,
