charles, robert, darwin, frs, frgs, fls, fzs, jp, d, r, w, n, dar, win, 12, february, 1809, 19, april, 1882, was, an, english, naturalist, geologist, and, biologist, widely, known, for, his, contributions, to, evolutionary, biology, his, proposition, that, all, species, of, life, have, descended, from, a, common, ancestor, is, now, generally, accepted, and, considered, a, fundamental, scientific, concept, in, a, joint, publication, with, alfred, russel, wallace, he, introduced, his, scientific, theory, that, this, branching, pattern, of, evolution, resulted, from, a, process, he, called, natural, selection, in, which, the, struggle, for, existence, has, a, similar, effect, to, the, artificial, selection, involved, in, selective, breeding, darwin, has, been, described, as, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, human, history, and, was, honoured, by, burial, in, westminster, abbey, darwin, s, early, interest, in, nature, led, him, to, neglect, his, medical, education, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, instead, he, helped, to, investigate, marine, invertebrates, his, studies, at, the, university, of, cambridge, s, christ, s, college, from, 1828, to, 1831, encouraged, his, passion, for, natural, science, however, it, was, his, five, year, voyage, on, hms, beagle, from, 1831, to, 1836, that, truly, established, darwin, as, an, eminent, geologist, the, observations, and, theories, he, developed, during, his, voyage, supported, charles, lyell, s, concept, of, gradual, geological, change, publication, of, his, journal, of, the, voyage, made, darwin, famous, as, a, popular, author, puzzled, by, the, geographical, distribution, of, wildlife, and, fossils, he, collected, on, the, voyage, darwin, began, detailed, investigations, and, in, 1838, devised, his, theory, of, natural, selection, although, he, discussed, his, ideas, with, several, naturalists, he, needed, time, for, extensive, research, and, his, geological, work, had, priority, he, was, writing, up, his, theory, in, 1858, when, alfred, russel, wallace, sent, him, an, essay, that, described, the, same, idea, prompting, the, immediate, joint, submission, of, both, their, theories, to, the, linnean, society, of, london, darwin, s, work, established, evolutionary, descent, with, modification, as, the, dominant, scientific, explanation, of, natural, diversification, in, 1871, he, examined, human, evolution, and, sexual, selection, in, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, followed, by, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, 1872, his, research, on, plants, was, published, in, a, series, of, books, and, in, his, final, book, the, formation, of, vegetable, mould, through, the, actions, of, worms, 1881, he, examined, earthworms, and, their, effect, on, soil, darwin, published, his, theory, of, evolution, with, compelling, evidence, in, his, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, by, the, 1870s, the, scientific, community, and, a, majority, of, the, educated, public, had, accepted, evolution, as, a, fact, however, many, initially, favored, competing, explanations, that, gave, only, a, minor, role, to, natural, selection, and, it, was, not, until, the, emergence, of, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, from, the, 1930s, to, the, 1950s, that, a, broad, consensus, developed, in, which, natural, selection, was, the, basic, mechanism, of, evolution, darwin, s, scientific, discovery, is, the, unifying, theory, of, the, life, sciences, explaining, the, diversity, of, life, darwin, was, born, in, shrewsbury, shropshire, on, 12, february, 1809, at, his, family, s, home, the, mount, he, was, the, fifth, of, six, children, of, wealthy, society, doctor, and, financier, robert, darwin, and, susannah, darwin, n, e, wedgwood, his, grandfathers, erasmus, darwin, and, josiah, wedgwood, were, both, prominent, abolitionists, erasmus, darwin, had, praised, general, concepts, of, evolution, and, common, descent, in, his, zoonomia, 1794, a, poetic, fantasy, of, gradual, creation, including, undeveloped, ideas, anticipating, concepts, his, grandson, expanded, both, families, were, largely, unitarian, though, the, wedgwoods, were, adopting, anglicanism, robert, darwin, a, freethinker, had, baby, charles, baptised, in, november, 1809, in, the, anglican, st, chad, s, church, shrewsbury, but, charles, and, his, siblings, attended, the, local, unitarian, church, with, their, mother, the, eight, year, old, charles, already, had, a, taste, for, natural, history, and, collecting, when, he, joined, the, day, school, run, by, its, preacher, in, 1817, that, july, his, mother, died, from, september, 1818, he, joined, his, older, brother, erasmus, in, attending, the, nearby, anglican, shrewsbury, school, as, a, boarder, darwin, spent, the, summer, of, 1825, as, an, apprentice, doctor, helping, his, father, treat, the, poor, of, shropshire, before, going, to, the, well, regarded, university, of, edinburgh, medical, school, with, his, brother, erasmus, in, october, 1825, darwin, found, lectures, dull, and, surgery, distressing, so, he, neglected, his, studies, he, learned, taxidermy, in, around, 40, daily, hour, long, sessions, from, john, edmonstone, a, freed, black, slave, who, had, accompanied, charles, waterton, in, the, south, american, rainforest, in, darwin, s, second, year, at, the, university, he, joined, the, plinian, society, a, student, natural, history, group, featuring, lively, debates, in, which, radical, democratic, students, with, materialistic, views, challenged, orthodox, religious, concepts, of, science, he, assisted, robert, edmond, grant, s, investigations, of, the, anatomy, and, life, cycle, of, marine, invertebrates, in, the, firth, of, forth, and, on, 27, march, 1827, presented, at, the, plinian, his, own, discovery, that, black, spores, found, in, oyster, shells, were, the, eggs, of, a, skate, leech, one, day, grant, praised, lamarck, s, evolutionary, ideas, darwin, was, astonished, by, grant, s, audacity, but, had, recently, read, similar, ideas, in, his, grandfather, erasmus, journals, darwin, was, rather, bored, by, robert, jameson, s, natural, history, course, which, covered, geology, including, the, debate, between, neptunism, and, plutonism, he, learned, the, classification, of, plants, and, assisted, with, work, on, the, collections, of, the, university, museum, one, of, the, largest, museums, in, europe, at, the, time, darwin, s, neglect, of, medical, studies, annoyed, his, father, who, sent, him, to, christ, s, college, cambridge, in, january, 1828, to, study, for, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, as, the, first, step, towards, becoming, an, anglican, country, parson, darwin, was, unqualified, for, cambridge, s, tripos, exams, and, was, required, instead, to, join, the, ordinary, degree, course, he, preferred, riding, and, shooting, to, studying, during, the, first, few, months, of, darwin, s, enrolment, at, christ, s, college, his, second, cousin, william, darwin, fox, was, still, studying, there, fox, impressed, him, with, his, butterfly, collection, introducing, darwin, to, entomology, and, influencing, him, to, pursue, beetle, collecting, he, did, this, zealously, and, had, some, of, his, finds, published, in, james, francis, stephens, illustrations, of, british, entomology, 1829, 1932, through, fox, darwin, became, a, close, friend, and, follower, of, botany, professor, john, stevens, henslow, he, met, other, leading, parson, naturalists, who, saw, scientific, work, as, religious, natural, theology, becoming, known, to, these, dons, as, the, man, who, walks, with, henslow, when, his, own, exams, drew, near, darwin, applied, himself, to, his, studies, and, was, delighted, by, the, language, and, logic, of, william, paley, s, evidences, of, christianity, 1795, in, his, final, examination, in, january, 1831, darwin, did, well, coming, tenth, out, of, 178, candidates, for, the, ordinary, degree, darwin, had, to, stay, at, cambridge, until, june, 1831, he, studied, paley, s, natural, theology, or, evidences, of, the, existence, and, attributes, of, the, deity, first, published, in, 1802, which, made, an, argument, for, divine, design, in, nature, explaining, adaptation, as, god, acting, through, laws, of, nature, he, read, john, herschel, s, new, book, preliminary, discourse, on, the, study, of, natural, philosophy, 1831, which, described, the, highest, aim, of, natural, philosophy, as, understanding, such, laws, through, inductive, reasoning, based, on, observation, and, alexander, von, humboldt, s, personal, narrative, of, scientific, travels, in, 1799, 1804, inspired, with, a, burning, zeal, to, contribute, darwin, planned, to, visit, tenerife, with, some, classmates, after, graduation, to, study, natural, history, in, the, tropics, in, preparation, he, joined, adam, sedgwick, s, geology, course, then, on, 4, august, travelled, with, him, to, spend, a, fortnight, mapping, strata, in, wales, after, leaving, sedgwick, in, wales, darwin, spent, a, few, days, with, student, friends, at, barmouth, he, returned, home, on, 29, august, to, find, a, letter, from, henslow, proposing, him, as, a, suitable, if, unfinished, naturalist, for, a, self, funded, supernumerary, place, on, hms, beagle, with, captain, robert, fitzroy, a, position, for, a, gentleman, rather, than, a, mere, collector, the, ship, was, to, leave, in, four, weeks, on, an, expedition, to, chart, the, coastline, of, south, america, robert, darwin, objected, to, his, son, s, planned, two, year, voyage, regarding, it, as, a, waste, of, time, but, was, persuaded, by, his, brother, in, law, josiah, wedgwood, ii, to, agree, to, and, fund, his, son, s, participation, darwin, took, care, to, remain, in, a, private, capacity, to, retain, control, over, his, collection, intending, it, for, a, major, scientific, institution, after, delays, the, voyage, began, on, 27, december, 1831, it, lasted, almost, five, years, as, fitzroy, had, intended, darwin, spent, most, of, that, time, on, land, investigating, geology, and, making, natural, history, collections, while, hms, beagle, surveyed, and, charted, coasts, he, kept, careful, notes, of, his, observations, and, theoretical, speculations, and, at, intervals, during, the, voyage, his, specimens, were, sent, to, cambridge, together, with, letters, including, a, copy, of, his, journal, for, his, family, he, had, some, expertise, in, geology, beetle, collecting, and, dissecting, marine, invertebrates, but, in, all, other, areas, was, a, novice, and, ably, collected, specimens, for, expert, appraisal, despite, suffering, badly, from, seasickness, darwin, wrote, copious, notes, while, on, board, the, ship, most, of, his, zoology, notes, are, about, marine, invertebrates, starting, with, plankton, collected, during, a, calm, spell, on, their, first, stop, ashore, at, st, jago, in, cape, verde, darwin, found, that, a, white, band, high, in, the, volcanic, rock, cliffs, included, seashells, fitzroy, had, given, him, the, first, volume, of, charles, lyell, s, principles, of, geology, which, set, out, uniformitarian, concepts, of, land, slowly, rising, or, falling, over, immense, periods, and, darwin, saw, things, lyell, s, way, theorising, and, thinking, of, writing, a, book, on, geology, when, they, reached, brazil, darwin, was, delighted, by, the, tropical, forest, but, detested, the, sight, of, slavery, there, and, disputed, this, issue, with, fitzroy, the, survey, continued, to, the, south, in, patagonia, they, stopped, at, bah, a, blanca, and, in, cliffs, near, punta, alta, darwin, made, a, major, find, of, fossil, bones, of, huge, extinct, mammals, beside, modern, seashells, indicating, recent, extinction, with, no, signs, of, change, in, climate, or, catastrophe, he, found, bony, plates, like, a, giant, version, of, the, armour, on, local, armadillos, from, a, jaw, and, tooth, he, identified, the, gigantic, megatherium, then, from, cuvier, s, description, thought, the, armour, was, from, this, animal, the, finds, were, shipped, to, england, and, scientists, found, the, fossils, of, great, interest, in, patagonia, darwin, came, to, wrongly, believe, the, territory, was, devoid, of, reptiles, on, rides, with, gauchos, into, the, interior, to, explore, geology, and, collect, more, fossils, darwin, gained, social, political, and, anthropological, insights, into, both, native, and, colonial, people, at, a, time, of, revolution, and, learnt, that, two, types, of, rhea, had, separate, but, overlapping, territories, further, south, he, saw, stepped, plains, of, shingle, and, seashells, as, raised, beaches, at, a, series, of, elevations, he, read, lyell, s, second, volume, and, accepted, its, view, of, centres, of, creation, of, species, but, his, discoveries, and, theorising, challenged, lyell, s, ideas, of, smooth, continuity, and, of, extinction, of, species, three, fuegians, on, board, who, had, been, seized, during, the, first, beagle, voyage, then, given, christian, education, in, england, were, returning, with, a, missionary, darwin, found, them, friendly, and, civilised, yet, at, tierra, del, fuego, he, met, miserable, degraded, savages, as, different, as, wild, from, domesticated, animals, he, remained, convinced, that, despite, this, diversity, all, humans, were, interrelated, with, a, shared, origin, and, potential, for, improvement, towards, civilisation, unlike, his, scientist, friends, he, now, thought, there, was, no, unbridgeable, gap, between, humans, and, animals, a, year, on, the, mission, had, been, abandoned, the, fuegian, they, had, named, jemmy, button, lived, like, the, other, natives, had, a, wife, and, had, no, wish, to, return, to, england, darwin, experienced, an, earthquake, in, chile, in, 1835, and, saw, signs, that, the, land, had, just, been, raised, including, mussel, beds, stranded, above, high, tide, high, in, the, andes, he, saw, seashells, and, several, fossil, trees, that, had, grown, on, a, sand, beach, he, theorised, that, as, the, land, rose, oceanic, islands, sank, and, coral, reefs, round, them, grew, to, form, atolls, on, the, geologically, new, gal, pagos, islands, darwin, looked, for, evidence, attaching, wildlife, to, an, older, centre, of, creation, and, found, mockingbirds, allied, to, those, in, chile, but, differing, from, island, to, island, he, heard, that, slight, variations, in, the, shape, of, tortoise, shells, showed, which, island, they, came, from, but, failed, to, collect, them, even, after, eating, tortoises, taken, on, board, as, food, in, australia, the, marsupial, rat, kangaroo, and, the, platypus, seemed, so, unusual, that, darwin, thought, it, was, almost, as, though, two, distinct, creators, had, been, at, work, he, found, the, aborigines, good, humoured, pleasant, their, numbers, depleted, by, european, settlement, fitzroy, investigated, how, the, atolls, of, the, cocos, keeling, islands, had, formed, and, the, survey, supported, darwin, s, theorising, fitzroy, began, writing, the, official, narrative, of, the, beagle, voyages, and, after, reading, darwin, s, diary, he, proposed, incorporating, it, into, the, account, darwin, s, journal, was, eventually, rewritten, as, a, separate, third, volume, on, geology, and, natural, history, in, cape, town, south, africa, darwin, and, fitzroy, met, john, herschel, who, had, recently, written, to, lyell, praising, his, uniformitarianism, as, opening, bold, speculation, on, that, mystery, of, mysteries, the, replacement, of, extinct, species, by, others, as, a, natural, in, contradistinction, to, a, miraculous, process, when, organising, his, notes, as, the, ship, sailed, home, darwin, wrote, that, if, his, growing, suspicions, about, the, mockingbirds, the, tortoises, and, the, falkland, islands, fox, were, correct, such, facts, undermine, the, stability, of, species, then, cautiously, added, would, before, undermine, he, later, wrote, that, such, facts, seemed, to, me, to, throw, some, light, on, the, origin, of, species, without, telling, darwin, extracts, from, his, letters, to, henslow, had, been, read, to, scientific, societies, printed, as, a, pamphlet, for, private, distribution, among, members, of, the, cambridge, philosophical, society, and, reported, in, magazines, including, the, athenaeum, darwin, first, heard, of, this, at, cape, town, and, at, ascension, island, read, of, sedgwick, s, prediction, that, darwin, will, have, a, great, name, among, the, naturalists, of, europe, on, 2, october, 1836, beagle, anchored, at, falmouth, cornwall, darwin, promptly, made, the, long, coach, journey, to, shrewsbury, to, visit, his, home, and, see, relatives, he, then, hurried, to, cambridge, to, see, henslow, who, advised, him, on, finding, available, naturalists, to, catalogue, darwin, s, animal, collections, and, to, take, on, the, botanical, specimens, darwin, s, father, organised, investments, enabling, his, son, to, be, a, self, funded, gentleman, scientist, and, an, excited, darwin, went, around, the, london, institutions, being, f, ted, and, seeking, experts, to, describe, the, collections, british, zoologists, at, the, time, had, a, huge, backlog, of, work, due, to, natural, history, collecting, being, encouraged, throughout, the, british, empire, and, there, was, a, danger, of, specimens, just, being, left, in, storage, charles, lyell, eagerly, met, darwin, for, the, first, time, on, 29, october, and, soon, introduced, him, to, the, up, and, coming, anatomist, richard, owen, who, had, the, facilities, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, to, work, on, the, fossil, bones, collected, by, darwin, owen, s, surprising, results, included, other, gigantic, extinct, ground, sloths, as, well, as, the, megatherium, darwin, had, identified, a, near, complete, skeleton, of, the, unknown, scelidotherium, and, a, hippopotamus, sized, rodent, like, skull, named, toxodon, resembling, a, giant, capybara, the, armour, fragments, were, actually, from, glyptodon, a, huge, armadillo, like, creature, as, darwin, had, initially, thought, these, extinct, creatures, were, related, to, living, species, in, south, america, in, mid, december, darwin, took, lodgings, in, cambridge, to, arrange, expert, classification, of, his, collections, and, prepare, his, own, research, for, publication, questions, of, how, to, combine, his, diary, into, the, narrative, were, resolved, at, the, end, of, the, month, when, fitzroy, accepted, broderip, s, advice, to, make, it, a, separate, volume, and, darwin, began, work, on, his, journal, and, remarks, darwin, s, first, paper, showed, that, the, south, american, landmass, was, slowly, rising, and, with, lyell, s, enthusiastic, backing, he, read, it, to, the, geological, society, of, london, on, 4, january, 1837, on, the, same, day, he, presented, his, mammal, and, bird, specimens, to, the, zoological, society, the, ornithologist, john, gould, soon, announced, that, the, gal, pagos, birds, that, darwin, had, thought, a, mixture, of, blackbirds, gros, beaks, and, finches, were, in, fact, twelve, separate, species, of, finches, on, 17, february, darwin, was, elected, to, the, council, of, the, geological, society, and, lyell, s, presidential, address, presented, owen, s, findings, on, darwin, s, fossils, stressing, geographical, continuity, of, species, as, supporting, his, uniformitarian, ideas, early, in, march, darwin, moved, to, london, to, be, near, this, work, joining, lyell, s, social, circle, of, scientists, and, experts, such, as, charles, babbage, who, described, god, as, a, programmer, of, laws, darwin, stayed, with, his, freethinking, brother, erasmus, part, of, this, whig, circle, and, a, close, friend, of, the, writer, harriet, martineau, who, promoted, the, malthusianism, that, underpinned, the, controversial, whig, poor, law, reforms, to, stop, welfare, from, causing, overpopulation, and, more, poverty, as, a, unitarian, she, welcomed, the, radical, implications, of, transmutation, of, species, promoted, by, grant, and, younger, surgeons, influenced, by, geoffroy, transmutation, was, anathema, to, anglicans, defending, social, order, but, reputable, scientists, openly, discussed, the, subject, and, there, was, wide, interest, in, john, herschel, s, letter, praising, lyell, s, approach, as, a, way, to, find, a, natural, cause, of, the, origin, of, new, species, gould, met, darwin, and, told, him, that, the, gal, pagos, mockingbirds, from, different, islands, were, separate, species, not, just, varieties, and, what, darwin, had, thought, was, a, wren, was, in, the, finch, group, darwin, had, not, labelled, the, finches, by, island, but, from, the, notes, of, others, on, the, ship, including, fitzroy, he, allocated, species, to, islands, the, two, rheas, were, distinct, species, and, on, 14, march, darwin, announced, how, their, distribution, changed, going, southwards, by, mid, march, 1837, barely, six, months, after, his, return, to, england, darwin, was, speculating, in, his, red, notebook, on, the, possibility, that, one, species, does, change, into, another, to, explain, the, geographical, distribution, of, living, species, such, as, the, rheas, and, extinct, ones, such, as, the, strange, extinct, mammal, macrauchenia, which, resembled, a, giant, guanaco, a, llama, relative, around, mid, july, he, recorded, in, his, b, notebook, his, thoughts, on, lifespan, and, variation, across, generations, explaining, the, variations, he, had, observed, in, gal, pagos, tortoises, mockingbirds, and, rheas, he, sketched, branching, descent, and, then, a, genealogical, branching, of, a, single, evolutionary, tree, in, which, it, is, absurd, to, talk, of, one, animal, being, higher, than, another, thereby, discarding, lamarck, s, idea, of, independent, lineages, progressing, to, higher, forms, while, developing, this, intensive, study, of, transmutation, darwin, became, mired, in, more, work, still, rewriting, his, journal, he, took, on, editing, and, publishing, the, expert, reports, on, his, collections, and, with, henslow, s, help, obtained, a, treasury, grant, of, 1, 000, to, sponsor, this, multi, volume, zoology, of, the, voyage, of, h, m, s, beagle, a, sum, equivalent, to, about, 115, 000, in, 2021, he, stretched, the, funding, to, include, his, planned, books, on, geology, and, agreed, to, unrealistic, dates, with, the, publisher, as, the, victorian, era, began, darwin, pressed, on, with, writing, his, journal, and, in, august, 1837, began, correcting, printer, s, proofs, as, darwin, worked, under, pressure, his, health, suffered, on, 20, september, he, had, an, uncomfortable, palpitation, of, the, heart, so, his, doctors, urged, him, to, knock, off, all, work, and, live, in, the, country, for, a, few, weeks, after, visiting, shrewsbury, he, joined, his, wedgwood, relatives, at, maer, hall, staffordshire, but, found, them, too, eager, for, tales, of, his, travels, to, give, him, much, rest, his, charming, intelligent, and, cultured, cousin, emma, wedgwood, nine, months, older, than, darwin, was, nursing, his, invalid, aunt, his, uncle, josiah, pointed, out, an, area, of, ground, where, cinders, had, disappeared, under, loam, and, suggested, that, this, might, have, been, the, work, of, earthworms, inspiring, a, new, important, theory, on, their, role, in, soil, formation, which, darwin, presented, at, the, geological, society, on, 1, november, 1837, his, journal, was, printed, and, ready, for, publication, by, the, end, of, february, 1838, as, was, the, first, volume, of, the, narrative, but, fitzroy, was, still, working, hard, to, finish, his, own, volume, william, whewell, pushed, darwin, to, take, on, the, duties, of, secretary, of, the, geological, society, after, initially, declining, the, work, he, accepted, the, post, in, march, 1838, despite, the, grind, of, writing, and, editing, the, beagle, reports, darwin, made, remarkable, progress, on, transmutation, taking, every, opportunity, to, question, expert, naturalists, and, unconventionally, people, with, practical, experience, in, selective, breeding, such, as, farmers, and, pigeon, fanciers, over, time, his, research, drew, on, information, from, his, relatives, and, children, the, family, butler, neighbours, colonists, and, former, shipmates, he, included, mankind, in, his, speculations, from, the, outset, and, on, seeing, an, orangutan, in, the, zoo, on, 28, march, 1838, noted, its, childlike, behaviour, the, strain, took, a, toll, and, by, june, he, was, being, laid, up, for, days, on, end, with, stomach, problems, headaches, and, heart, symptoms, for, the, rest, of, his, life, he, was, repeatedly, incapacitated, with, episodes, of, stomach, pains, vomiting, severe, boils, palpitations, trembling, and, other, symptoms, particularly, during, times, of, stress, such, as, attending, meetings, or, making, social, visits, the, cause, of, darwin, s, illness, remained, unknown, and, attempts, at, treatment, had, only, ephemeral, success, on, 23, june, he, took, a, break, and, went, geologising, in, scotland, he, visited, glen, roy, in, glorious, weather, to, see, the, parallel, roads, cut, into, the, hillsides, at, three, heights, he, later, published, his, view, that, these, were, marine, raised, beaches, but, then, had, to, accept, that, they, were, shorelines, of, a, proglacial, lake, fully, recuperated, he, returned, to, shrewsbury, in, july, 1838, used, to, jotting, down, daily, notes, on, animal, breeding, he, scrawled, rambling, thoughts, about, marriage, career, and, prospects, on, two, scraps, of, paper, one, with, columns, headed, marry, and, not, marry, advantages, under, marry, included, constant, companion, and, a, friend, in, old, age, better, than, a, dog, anyhow, against, points, such, as, less, money, for, books, and, terrible, loss, of, time, having, decided, in, favour, of, marriage, he, discussed, it, with, his, father, then, went, to, visit, his, cousin, emma, on, 29, july, at, this, time, he, did, not, get, around, to, proposing, but, against, his, father, s, advice, he, mentioned, his, ideas, on, transmutation, he, married, emma, on, 29, january, 1839, and, they, were, the, parents, of, ten, children, seven, of, whom, survived, to, adulthood, continuing, his, research, in, london, darwin, s, wide, reading, now, included, the, sixth, edition, of, malthus, s, an, essay, on, the, principle, of, population, on, 28, september, 1838, he, noted, its, assertion, that, human, population, when, unchecked, goes, on, doubling, itself, every, twenty, five, years, or, increases, in, a, geometrical, ratio, a, geometric, progression, so, that, population, soon, exceeds, food, supply, in, what, is, known, as, a, malthusian, catastrophe, darwin, was, well, prepared, to, compare, this, to, augustin, de, candolle, s, warring, of, the, species, of, plants, and, the, struggle, for, existence, among, wildlife, explaining, how, numbers, of, a, species, kept, roughly, stable, as, species, always, breed, beyond, available, resources, favourable, variations, would, make, organisms, better, at, surviving, and, passing, the, variations, on, to, their, offspring, while, unfavourable, variations, would, be, lost, he, wrote, that, the, final, cause, of, all, this, wedging, must, be, to, sort, out, proper, structure, adapt, it, to, changes, so, that, one, may, say, there, is, a, force, like, a, hundred, thousand, wedges, trying, force, into, every, kind, of, adapted, structure, into, the, gaps, of, in, the, economy, of, nature, or, rather, forming, gaps, by, thrusting, out, weaker, ones, this, would, result, in, the, formation, of, new, species, as, he, later, wrote, in, his, autobiography, in, october, 1838, that, is, fifteen, months, after, i, had, begun, my, systematic, enquiry, i, happened, to, read, for, amusement, malthus, on, population, and, being, well, prepared, to, appreciate, the, struggle, for, existence, which, everywhere, goes, on, from, long, continued, observation, of, the, habits, of, animals, and, plants, it, at, once, struck, me, that, under, these, circumstances, favourable, variations, would, tend, to, be, preserved, and, unfavourable, ones, to, be, destroyed, the, result, of, this, would, be, the, formation, of, new, species, here, then, i, had, at, last, got, a, theory, by, which, to, work, by, mid, december, darwin, saw, a, similarity, between, farmers, picking, the, best, stock, in, selective, breeding, and, a, malthusian, nature, selecting, from, chance, variants, so, that, every, part, of, newly, acquired, structure, is, fully, practical, and, perfected, thinking, this, comparison, a, beautiful, part, of, my, theory, he, later, called, his, theory, natural, selection, an, analogy, with, what, he, termed, the, artificial, selection, of, selective, breeding, on, 11, november, he, returned, to, maer, and, proposed, to, emma, once, more, telling, her, his, ideas, she, accepted, then, in, exchanges, of, loving, letters, she, showed, how, she, valued, his, openness, in, sharing, their, differences, while, expressing, her, strong, unitarian, beliefs, and, concerns, that, his, honest, doubts, might, separate, them, in, the, afterlife, while, he, was, house, hunting, in, london, bouts, of, illness, continued, and, emma, wrote, urging, him, to, get, some, rest, almost, prophetically, remarking, so, don, t, be, ill, any, more, my, dear, charley, till, i, can, be, with, you, to, nurse, you, he, found, what, they, called, macaw, cottage, because, of, its, gaudy, interiors, in, gower, street, then, moved, his, museum, in, over, christmas, on, 24, january, 1839, darwin, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, on, 29, january, darwin, and, emma, wedgwood, were, married, at, maer, in, an, anglican, ceremony, arranged, to, suit, the, unitarians, then, immediately, caught, the, train, to, london, and, their, new, home, darwin, now, had, the, framework, of, his, theory, of, natural, selection, by, which, to, work, as, his, prime, hobby, his, research, included, extensive, experimental, selective, breeding, of, plants, and, animals, finding, evidence, that, species, were, not, fixed, and, investigating, many, detailed, ideas, to, refine, and, substantiate, his, theory, for, fifteen, years, this, work, was, in, the, background, to, his, main, occupation, of, writing, on, geology, and, publishing, expert, reports, on, the, beagle, collections, in, particular, the, barnacles, the, impetus, of, darwin, s, barnacle, research, came, from, a, collection, of, a, barnacle, colony, from, chile, in, 1835, which, he, dubbed, mr, arthrobalanus, his, confusion, over, the, relationship, of, this, species, cryptophialus, minutus, to, other, barnacles, caused, him, to, fixate, on, the, systematics, of, the, taxa, he, wrote, his, first, examination, of, the, species, in, 1846, but, did, not, formally, describe, it, until, 1854, fitzroy, s, long, delayed, narrative, was, published, in, may, 1839, darwin, s, journal, and, remarks, got, good, reviews, as, the, third, volume, and, on, 15, august, it, was, published, on, its, own, early, in, 1842, darwin, wrote, about, his, ideas, to, charles, lyell, who, noted, that, his, ally, denies, seeing, a, beginning, to, each, crop, of, species, darwin, s, book, the, structure, and, distribution, of, coral, reefs, on, his, theory, of, atoll, formation, was, published, in, may, 1842, after, more, than, three, years, of, work, and, he, then, wrote, his, first, pencil, sketch, of, his, theory, of, natural, selection, to, escape, the, pressures, of, london, the, family, moved, to, rural, down, house, in, kent, in, september, on, 11, january, 1844, darwin, mentioned, his, theorising, to, the, botanist, joseph, dalton, hooker, writing, with, melodramatic, humour, it, is, like, confessing, a, murder, hooker, replied, there, may, in, my, opinion, have, been, a, series, of, productions, on, different, spots, also, a, gradual, change, of, species, i, shall, be, delighted, to, hear, how, you, think, that, this, change, may, have, taken, place, as, no, presently, conceived, opinions, satisfy, me, on, the, subject, by, july, darwin, had, expanded, his, sketch, into, a, 230, page, essay, to, be, expanded, with, his, research, results, if, he, died, prematurely, in, november, the, anonymously, published, sensational, best, seller, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, brought, wide, interest, in, transmutation, darwin, scorned, its, amateurish, geology, and, zoology, but, carefully, reviewed, his, own, arguments, controversy, erupted, and, it, continued, to, sell, well, despite, contemptuous, dismissal, by, scientists, darwin, completed, his, third, geological, book, in, 1846, he, now, renewed, a, fascination, and, expertise, in, marine, invertebrates, dating, back, to, his, student, days, with, grant, by, dissecting, and, classifying, the, barnacles, he, had, collected, on, the, voyage, enjoying, observing, beautiful, structures, and, thinking, about, comparisons, with, allied, structures, in, 1847, hooker, read, the, essay, and, sent, notes, that, provided, darwin, with, the, calm, critical, feedback, that, he, needed, but, would, not, commit, himself, and, questioned, darwin, s, opposition, to, continuing, acts, of, creation, in, an, attempt, to, improve, his, chronic, ill, health, darwin, went, in, 1849, to, dr, james, gully, s, malvern, spa, and, was, surprised, to, find, some, benefit, from, hydrotherapy, then, in, 1851, his, treasured, daughter, annie, fell, ill, reawakening, his, fears, that, his, illness, might, be, hereditary, she, died, the, same, year, after, a, long, series, of, crises, in, eight, years, of, work, on, barnacles, darwin, s, theory, helped, him, to, find, homologies, showing, that, slightly, changed, body, parts, served, different, functions, to, meet, new, conditions, and, in, some, genera, he, found, minute, males, parasitic, on, hermaphrodites, showing, an, intermediate, stage, in, evolution, of, distinct, sexes, in, 1853, it, earned, him, the, royal, society, s, royal, medal, and, it, made, his, reputation, as, a, biologist, upon, the, conclusion, of, his, research, darwin, declared, i, hate, a, barnacle, as, no, man, ever, did, before, in, 1854, he, became, a, fellow, of, the, linnean, society, of, london, gaining, postal, access, to, its, library, he, began, a, major, reassessment, of, his, theory, of, species, and, in, november, realised, that, divergence, in, the, character, of, descendants, could, be, explained, by, them, becoming, adapted, to, diversified, places, in, the, economy, of, nature, by, the, start, of, 1856, darwin, was, investigating, whether, eggs, and, seeds, could, survive, travel, across, seawater, to, spread, species, across, oceans, hooker, increasingly, doubted, the, traditional, view, that, species, were, fixed, but, their, young, friend, thomas, henry, huxley, was, still, firmly, against, the, transmutation, of, species, lyell, was, intrigued, by, darwin, s, speculations, without, realising, their, extent, when, he, read, a, paper, by, alfred, russel, wallace, on, the, law, which, has, regulated, the, introduction, of, new, species, he, saw, similarities, with, darwin, s, thoughts, and, urged, him, to, publish, to, establish, precedence, though, darwin, saw, no, threat, on, 14, may, 1856, he, began, writing, a, short, paper, finding, answers, to, difficult, questions, held, him, up, repeatedly, and, he, expanded, his, plans, to, a, big, book, on, species, titled, natural, selection, which, was, to, include, his, note, on, man, he, continued, his, research, obtaining, information, and, specimens, from, naturalists, worldwide, including, wallace, who, was, working, in, borneo, in, mid, 1857, he, added, a, section, heading, theory, applied, to, races, of, man, but, did, not, add, text, on, this, topic, on, 5, september, 1857, darwin, sent, the, american, botanist, asa, gray, a, detailed, outline, of, his, ideas, including, an, abstract, of, natural, selection, which, omitted, human, origins, and, sexual, selection, in, december, darwin, received, a, letter, from, wallace, asking, if, the, book, would, examine, human, origins, he, responded, that, he, would, avoid, that, subject, so, surrounded, with, prejudices, while, encouraging, wallace, s, theorising, and, adding, that, i, go, much, further, than, you, darwin, s, book, was, only, partly, written, when, on, 18, june, 1858, he, received, a, paper, from, wallace, describing, natural, selection, shocked, that, he, had, been, forestalled, darwin, sent, it, on, that, day, to, lyell, as, requested, by, wallace, and, although, wallace, had, not, asked, for, publication, darwin, suggested, he, would, send, it, to, any, journal, that, wallace, chose, his, family, was, in, crisis, with, children, in, the, village, dying, of, scarlet, fever, and, he, put, matters, in, the, hands, of, his, friends, after, some, discussion, with, no, reliable, way, of, involving, wallace, lyell, and, hooker, decided, on, a, joint, presentation, at, the, linnean, society, on, 1, july, of, on, the, tendency, of, species, to, form, varieties, and, on, the, perpetuation, of, varieties, and, species, by, natural, means, of, selection, on, the, evening, of, 28, june, darwin, s, baby, son, died, of, scarlet, fever, after, almost, a, week, of, severe, illness, and, he, was, too, distraught, to, attend, there, was, little, immediate, attention, to, this, announcement, of, the, theory, the, president, of, the, linnean, society, remarked, in, may, 1859, that, the, year, had, not, been, marked, by, any, revolutionary, discoveries, only, one, review, rankled, enough, for, darwin, to, recall, it, later, professor, samuel, haughton, of, dublin, claimed, that, all, that, was, new, in, them, was, false, and, what, was, true, was, old, darwin, struggled, for, thirteen, months, to, produce, an, abstract, of, his, big, book, suffering, from, ill, health, but, getting, constant, encouragement, from, his, scientific, friends, lyell, arranged, to, have, it, published, by, john, murray, on, the, origin, of, species, proved, unexpectedly, popular, with, the, entire, stock, of, 1, 250, copies, oversubscribed, when, it, went, on, sale, to, booksellers, on, 22, november, 1859, in, the, book, darwin, set, out, one, long, argument, of, detailed, observations, inferences, and, consideration, of, anticipated, objections, in, making, the, case, for, common, descent, he, included, evidence, of, homologies, between, humans, and, other, mammals, having, outlined, sexual, selection, he, hinted, that, it, could, explain, differences, between, human, races, he, avoided, explicit, discussion, of, human, origins, but, implied, the, significance, of, his, work, with, the, sentence, light, will, be, thrown, on, the, origin, of, man, and, his, history, his, theory, is, simply, stated, in, the, introduction, as, many, more, individuals, of, each, species, are, born, than, can, possibly, survive, and, as, consequently, there, is, a, frequently, recurring, struggle, for, existence, it, follows, that, any, being, if, it, vary, however, slightly, in, any, manner, profitable, to, itself, under, the, complex, and, sometimes, varying, conditions, of, life, will, have, a, better, chance, of, surviving, and, thus, be, naturally, selected, from, the, strong, principle, of, inheritance, any, selected, variety, will, tend, to, propagate, its, new, and, modified, form, at, the, end, of, the, book, he, concluded, that, there, is, grandeur, in, this, view, of, life, with, its, several, powers, having, been, originally, breathed, into, a, few, forms, or, into, one, and, that, whilst, this, planet, has, gone, cycling, on, according, to, the, fixed, law, of, gravity, from, so, simple, a, beginning, endless, forms, most, beautiful, and, most, wonderful, have, been, and, are, being, evolved, the, last, word, was, the, only, variant, of, evolved, in, the, first, five, editions, of, the, book, evolutionism, at, that, time, was, associated, with, other, concepts, most, commonly, with, embryological, development, darwin, first, used, the, word, evolution, in, the, descent, of, man, in, 1871, before, adding, it, in, 1872, to, the, 6th, edition, of, the, origin, of, species, the, book, aroused, international, interest, with, less, controversy, than, had, greeted, the, popular, and, less, scientific, vestiges, of, the, natural, history, of, creation, though, darwin, s, illness, kept, him, away, from, the, public, debates, he, eagerly, scrutinised, the, scientific, response, commenting, on, press, cuttings, reviews, articles, satires, and, caricatures, and, corresponded, on, it, with, colleagues, worldwide, the, book, did, not, explicitly, discuss, human, origins, but, included, a, number, of, hints, about, the, animal, ancestry, of, humans, from, which, the, inference, could, be, made, the, first, review, asked, if, a, monkey, has, become, a, man, what, may, not, a, man, become, it, said, this, should, be, left, to, theologians, as, being, too, dangerous, for, ordinary, readers, amongst, early, favourable, responses, huxley, s, reviews, swiped, at, richard, owen, leader, of, the, scientific, establishment, which, huxley, was, trying, to, overthrow, in, april, owen, s, review, attacked, darwin, s, friends, and, condescendingly, dismissed, his, ideas, angering, darwin, but, owen, and, others, began, to, promote, ideas, of, supernaturally, guided, evolution, patrick, matthew, drew, attention, to, his, 1831, book, which, had, a, brief, appendix, suggesting, a, concept, of, natural, selection, leading, to, new, species, but, he, had, not, developed, the, idea, the, church, of, england, s, response, was, mixed, darwin, s, old, cambridge, tutors, sedgwick, and, henslow, dismissed, the, ideas, but, liberal, clergymen, interpreted, natural, selection, as, an, instrument, of, god, s, design, with, the, cleric, charles, kingsley, seeing, it, as, just, as, noble, a, conception, of, deity, in, 1860, the, publication, of, essays, and, reviews, by, seven, liberal, anglican, theologians, diverted, clerical, attention, from, darwin, its, ideas, including, higher, criticism, were, attacked, by, church, authorities, as, heresy, in, it, baden, powell, argued, that, miracles, broke, god, s, laws, so, belief, in, them, was, atheistic, and, praised, mr, darwin, s, masterly, volume, the, grand, principle, of, the, self, evolving, powers, of, nature, asa, gray, discussed, teleology, with, darwin, who, imported, and, distributed, gray, s, pamphlet, on, theistic, evolution, natural, selection, is, not, inconsistent, with, natural, theology, the, most, famous, confrontation, was, at, the, public, 1860, oxford, evolution, debate, during, a, meeting, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, where, the, bishop, of, oxford, samuel, wilberforce, though, not, opposed, to, transmutation, of, species, argued, against, darwin, s, explanation, and, human, descent, from, apes, joseph, hooker, argued, strongly, for, darwin, and, thomas, huxley, s, legendary, retort, that, he, would, rather, be, descended, from, an, ape, than, a, man, who, misused, his, gifts, came, to, symbolise, a, triumph, of, science, over, religion, even, darwin, s, close, friends, gray, hooker, huxley, and, lyell, still, expressed, various, reservations, but, gave, strong, support, as, did, many, others, particularly, younger, naturalists, gray, and, lyell, sought, reconciliation, with, faith, while, huxley, portrayed, a, polarisation, between, religion, and, science, he, campaigned, pugnaciously, against, the, authority, of, the, clergy, in, education, aiming, to, overturn, the, dominance, of, clergymen, and, aristocratic, amateurs, under, owen, in, favour, of, a, new, generation, of, professional, scientists, owen, s, claim, that, brain, anatomy, proved, humans, to, be, a, separate, biological, order, from, apes, was, shown, to, be, false, by, huxley, in, a, long, running, dispute, parodied, by, kingsley, as, the, great, hippocampus, question, and, discredited, owen, in, response, to, objections, that, the, origin, of, life, was, unexplained, darwin, pointed, to, acceptance, of, newton, s, law, even, though, the, cause, of, gravity, was, unknown, despite, criticisms, and, reservations, related, to, this, topic, he, nevertheless, proposed, a, prescient, idea, in, an, 1871, letter, to, hooker, in, which, he, suggested, the, origin, of, life, may, have, occurred, in, a, warm, little, pond, darwinism, became, a, movement, covering, a, wide, range, of, evolutionary, ideas, in, 1863, lyell, s, geological, evidences, of, the, antiquity, of, man, popularised, prehistory, though, his, caution, on, evolution, disappointed, darwin, weeks, later, huxley, s, evidence, as, to, man, s, place, in, nature, showed, that, anatomically, humans, are, apes, then, the, naturalist, on, the, river, amazons, by, henry, walter, bates, provided, empirical, evidence, of, natural, selection, lobbying, brought, darwin, britain, s, highest, scientific, honour, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, awarded, on, 3, november, 1864, that, day, huxley, held, the, first, meeting, of, what, became, the, influential, x, club, devoted, to, science, pure, and, free, untrammelled, by, religious, dogmas, by, the, end, of, the, decade, most, scientists, agreed, that, evolution, occurred, but, only, a, minority, supported, darwin, s, view, that, the, chief, mechanism, was, natural, selection, the, origin, of, species, was, translated, into, many, languages, becoming, a, staple, scientific, text, attracting, thoughtful, attention, from, all, walks, of, life, including, the, working, men, who, flocked, to, huxley, s, lectures, darwin, s, theory, resonated, with, various, movements, at, the, time, and, became, a, key, fixture, of, popular, culture, cartoonists, parodied, animal, ancestry, in, an, old, tradition, of, showing, humans, with, animal, traits, and, in, britain, these, droll, images, served, to, popularise, darwin, s, theory, in, an, unthreatening, way, while, ill, in, 1862, darwin, began, growing, a, beard, and, when, he, reappeared, in, public, in, 1866, caricatures, of, him, as, an, ape, helped, to, identify, all, forms, of, evolutionism, with, darwinism, despite, repeated, bouts, of, illness, during, the, last, twenty, two, years, of, his, life, darwin, s, work, continued, having, published, on, the, origin, of, species, as, an, abstract, of, his, theory, he, pressed, on, with, experiments, research, and, writing, of, his, big, book, he, covered, human, descent, from, earlier, animals, including, the, evolution, of, society, and, of, mental, abilities, as, well, as, explaining, decorative, beauty, in, wildlife, and, diversifying, into, innovative, plant, studies, enquiries, about, insect, pollination, led, in, 1861, to, novel, studies, of, wild, orchids, showing, adaptation, of, their, flowers, to, attract, specific, moths, to, each, species, and, ensure, cross, fertilisation, in, 1862, fertilisation, of, orchids, gave, his, first, detailed, demonstration, of, the, power, of, natural, selection, to, explain, complex, ecological, relationships, making, testable, predictions, as, his, health, declined, he, lay, on, his, sickbed, in, a, room, filled, with, inventive, experiments, to, trace, the, movements, of, climbing, plants, admiring, visitors, included, ernst, haeckel, a, zealous, proponent, of, darwinism, incorporating, lamarckism, and, goethe, s, idealism, wallace, remained, supportive, though, he, increasingly, turned, to, spiritualism, darwin, s, book, the, variation, of, animals, and, plants, under, domestication, 1868, was, the, first, part, of, his, planned, big, book, and, included, his, unsuccessful, hypothesis, of, pangenesis, attempting, to, explain, heredity, it, sold, briskly, at, first, despite, its, size, and, was, translated, into, many, languages, he, wrote, most, of, a, second, part, on, natural, selection, but, it, remained, unpublished, in, his, lifetime, lyell, had, already, popularised, human, prehistory, and, huxley, had, shown, that, anatomically, humans, are, apes, with, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, published, in, 1871, darwin, set, out, evidence, from, numerous, sources, that, humans, are, animals, showing, continuity, of, physical, and, mental, attributes, and, presented, sexual, selection, to, explain, impractical, animal, features, such, as, the, peacock, s, plumage, as, well, as, human, evolution, of, culture, differences, between, sexes, and, physical, and, cultural, racial, classification, while, emphasizing, that, humans, are, all, one, species, according, to, an, editorial, in, nature, journal, although, charles, darwin, opposed, slavery, and, proposed, that, humans, have, a, common, ancestor, he, also, advocated, a, hierarchy, of, races, with, white, people, higher, than, others, his, research, using, images, was, expanded, in, his, 1872, book, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, one, of, the, first, books, to, feature, printed, photographs, which, discussed, the, evolution, of, human, psychology, and, its, continuity, with, the, behaviour, of, animals, both, books, proved, very, popular, and, darwin, was, impressed, by, the, general, assent, with, which, his, views, had, been, received, remarking, that, everybody, is, talking, about, it, without, being, shocked, his, conclusion, was, that, man, with, all, his, noble, qualities, with, sympathy, which, feels, for, the, most, debased, with, benevolence, which, extends, not, only, to, other, men, but, to, the, humblest, living, creature, with, his, god, like, intellect, which, has, penetrated, into, the, movements, and, constitution, of, the, solar, system, with, all, these, exalted, powers, man, still, bears, in, his, bodily, frame, the, indelible, stamp, of, his, lowly, origin, his, evolution, related, experiments, and, investigations, led, to, books, on, insectivorous, plants, the, effects, of, cross, and, self, fertilisation, in, the, vegetable, kingdom, different, forms, of, flowers, on, plants, of, the, same, species, and, the, power, of, movement, in, plants, he, continued, to, collect, information, and, exchange, views, from, scientific, correspondents, all, over, the, world, including, mary, treat, whom, he, encouraged, to, persevere, in, her, scientific, work, he, was, the, first, person, to, recognize, the, significance, of, carnivory, in, plants, his, botanical, work, was, interpreted, and, popularised, by, various, writers, including, grant, allen, and, h, g, wells, and, helped, transform, plant, science, in, the, late, 19th, century, and, early, 20th, century, in, 1882, he, was, diagnosed, with, what, was, called, angina, pectoris, which, then, meant,

about, his, life, long, health, issues, he, died, at, down, house, on, 19, april, 1882, his, last, words, were, to, his, family, telling, emma, i, am, not, the, least, afraid, of, death, remember, what, a, good, wife, you, have, been, to, me, tell, all, my, children, to, remember, how, good, they, have, been, to, me, while, she, rested, he, repeatedly, told, henrietta, and, francis, it, s, almost, worthwhile, to, be, sick, to, be, nursed, by, you, he, had, expected, to, be, buried, in, st, mary, s, churchyard, at, downe, but, at, the, request, of, darwin, s, colleagues, after, public, and, parliamentary, petitioning, william, spottiswoode, president, of, the, royal, society, arranged, for, darwin, to, be, honoured, by, burial, in, westminster, abbey, close, to, john, herschel, and, isaac, newton, the, funeral, held, on, wednesday, 26, april, was, attended, by, thousands, of, people, including, family, friends, scientists, philosophers, and, dignitaries, as, alfred, russel, wallace, put, it, darwin, had, wrought, a, greater, revolution, in, human, thought, within, a, quarter, of, a, century, than, any, man, of, our, time, or, perhaps, any, time, having, given, us, a, new, conception, of, the, world, of, life, and, a, theory, which, is, itself, a, powerful, instrument, of, research, has, shown, us, how, to, combine, into, one, consistent, whole, the, facts, accumulated, by, all, the, separate, classes, of, workers, and, has, thereby, revolutionised, the, whole, study, of, nature, most, scientists, were, now, convinced, of, evolution, as, descent, with, modification, though, few, agreed, with, darwin, that, natural, selection, has, been, the, main, but, not, the, exclusive, means, of, modification, during, the, eclipse, of, darwinism, scientists, explored, alternative, mechanisms, then, ronald, fisher, incorporated, mendelian, genetics, in, the, genetical, theory, of, natural, selection, leading, to, population, genetics, and, the, modern, evolutionary, synthesis, which, continues, to, develop, scientific, discoveries, have, confirmed, and, validated, darwin, s, key, insights, geographical, features, given, his, name, include, darwin, sound, and, mount, darwin, both, named, while, he, was, on, the, beagle, voyage, and, darwin, harbour, named, by, his, former, shipmates, on, its, next, voyage, which, eventually, became, the, location, of, darwin, the, capital, city, of, australia, s, northern, territory, darwin, s, name, was, given, formally, or, informally, to, numerous, plants, and, animals, including, many, he, had, collected, on, the, voyage, the, linnean, society, of, london, began, awards, of, the, darwin, wallace, medal, in, 1908, to, mark, fifty, years, from, the, joint, reading, on, 1, july, 1858, of,

distinguished, as, an, astronomer, botanist, and, civil, engineer, respectively, all, three, were, knighted, another, son, leonard, went, on, to, be, a, soldier, politician, economist, eugenicist, and, mentor, of, the, statistician, and, evolutionary, biologist, ronald, fisher, darwin, s, family, tradition, was, nonconformist, unitarianism, while, his, father, and, grandfather, were, freethinkers, and, his, baptism, and, boarding, school, were, church, of, england, when, going, to, cambridge, to, become, an, anglican, clergyman, he, did, not, in, the, least, doubt, the, strict, and, literal, truth, of, every, word, in, the, bible, he, learned, john, herschel, s, science, which, like, william, paley, s, natural, theology, sought, explanations, in, laws, of, nature, rather, than, miracles, and, saw, adaptation, of, species, as, evidence, of, design, on, board, hms, beagle, darwin, was, quite, orthodox, and, would, quote, the, bible, as, an, authority, on, morality, he, looked, for, centres, of, creation, to, explain, distribution, and, suggested, that, the, very, similar, antlions, found, in, australia, and, england, were, evidence, of, a, divine, hand, upon, his, return, he, expressed, a, critical, view, of, the, bible, s, historical, accuracy, and, questioned, the, basis, for, considering, one, religion, more, valid, than, another, in, the, next, few, years, while, intensively, speculating, on, geology, and, the, transmutation, of, species, he, gave, much, thought, to, religion, and, openly, discussed, this, with, his, wife, emma, whose, beliefs, similarly, came, from, intensive, study, and, questioning, the, theodicy, of, paley, and, thomas, malthus, vindicated, evils, such, as, starvation, as, a, result, of, a, benevolent, creator, s, laws, which, had, an, overall, good, effect, to, darwin, natural, selection, produced, the, good, of, adaptation, but, removed, the, need, for, design, and, he, could, not, see, the, work, of, an, omnipotent, deity, in, all, the, pain, and, suffering, such, as, the, ichneumon, wasp, paralysing, caterpillars, as, live, food, for, its, eggs, though, he, thought, of, religion, as, a, tribal, survival, strategy, darwin, was, reluctant, to, give, up, the, idea, of, god, as, an, ultimate, lawgiver, he, was, increasingly, troubled, by, the, problem, of, evil, darwin, remained, close, friends, with, the, vicar, of, downe, john, brodie, innes, and, continued, to, play, a, leading, part, in, the, parish, work, of, the, church, but, from, c, 1849, would, go, for, a, walk, on, sundays, while, his, family, attended, church, he, considered, it, absurd, to, doubt, that, a, man, might, be, an, ardent, theist, and, an, evolutionist, and, though, reticent, about, his, religious, views, in, 1879, he, wrote, that, i, have, never, been, an, atheist, in, the, sense, of, denying, the, existence, of, a, god, i, think, that, generally, an, agnostic, would, be, the, most, correct, description, of, my, state, of, mind, the, lady, hope, story, published, in, 1915, claimed, that, darwin, had, reverted, to, christianity, on, his, sickbed, the, claims, were, repudiated, by, darwin, s, children, and, have, been, dismissed, as, false, by, historians, darwin, s, views, on, social, and, political, issues, reflected, his, time, and, social, position, he, grew, up, in, a, family, of, whig, reformers, who, like, his, uncle, josiah, wedgwood, supported, electoral, reform, and, the, emancipation, of, slaves, darwin, was, passionately, opposed, to, slavery, while, seeing, no, problem, with, the, working, conditions, of, english, factory, workers, or, servants, taking, taxidermy, lessons, in, 1826, from, the, freed, slave, john, edmonstone, whom, darwin, long, recalled, as, a, very, pleasant, and, intelligent, man, reinforced, his, belief, that, black, people, shared, the, same, feelings, and, could, be, as, intelligent, as, people, of, other, races, he, took, the, same, attitude, to, native, people, he, met, on, the, beagle, voyage, though, commonplace, in, britain, at, the, time, silliman, and, bachman, noticed, the, contrast, with, slave, owning, america, around, twenty, years, later, racism, became, a, feature, of, british, society, but, darwin, remained, strongly, against, slavery, against, ranking, the, so, called, races, of, man, as, distinct, species, and, against, ill, treatment, of, native, people, darwin, s, interaction, with, yaghans, fuegians, such, as, jemmy, button, during, the, second, voyage, of, hms, beagle, had, a, profound, impact, on, his, view, of, indigenous, peoples, at, his, arrival, in, tierra, del, fuego, he, made, a, colourful, description, of, fuegian, savages, this, view, changed, as, he, came, to, know, yaghan, people, more, in, detail, by, studying, the, yaghans, darwin, concluded, that, a, number, of, basic, emotions, by, different, human, groups, were, the, same, and, that, mental, capabilities, were, roughly, the, same, as, for, europeans, while, interested, in, yaghan, culture, darwin, failed, to, appreciate, their, deep, ecological, knowledge, and, elaborate, cosmology, until, the, 1850s, when, he, inspected, a, dictionary, of, yaghan, detailing, 32, 000, words, he, saw, that, european, colonisation, would, often, lead, to, the, extinction, of, native, civilisations, and, tr, to, integrate, colonialism, into, an, evolutionary, history, of, civilization, analogous, to, natural, history, darwin, s, view, of, women, was, that, men, s, eminence, over, them, was, the, outcome, of, sexual, selection, a, view, disputed, by, antoinette, brown, blackwell, in, her, 1875, book, the, sexes, throughout, nature, darwin, was, intrigued, by, his, half, cousin, francis, galton, s, argument, introduced, in, 1865, that, statistical, analysis, of, heredity, showed, that, moral, and, mental, human, traits, could, be, inherited, and, principles, of, animal, breeding, could, apply, to, humans, in, the, descent, of, man, darwin, noted, that, aiding, the, weak, to, survive, and, have, families, could, lose, the, benefits, of, natural, selection, but, cautioned, that, withholding, such, aid, would, endanger, the, instinct, of, sympathy, the, noblest, part, of, our, nature, and, factors, such, as, education, could, be, more, important, when, galton, suggested, that, publishing, research, could, encourage, intermarriage, within, a, caste, of, those, who, are, naturally, gifted, darwin, foresaw, practical, difficulties, and, thought, it, the, sole, feasible, yet, i, fear, utopian, plan, of, procedure, in, improving, the, human, race, preferring, to, simply, publicise, the, importance, of, inheritance, and, leave, decisions, to, individuals, francis, galton, named, this, field, of, study, eugenics, in, 1883, after, darwin, s, death, and, his, theories, were, cited, to, promote, eugenic, policies, darwin, s, fame, and, popularity, led, to, his, name, being, associated, with, ideas, and, movements, that, at, times, had, only, an, indirect, relation, to, his, writings, and, sometimes, went, directly, against, his, express, comments, thomas, malthus, had, argued, that, population, growth, beyond, resources, was, ordained, by, god, to, get, humans, to, work, productively, and, show, restraint, in, getting, families, this, was, used, in, the, 1830s, to, justify, workhouses, and, laissez, faire, economics, evolution, was, by, then, seen, as, having, social, implications, and, herbert, spencer, s, 1851, book, social, statics, based, ideas, of, human, freedom, and, individual, liberties, on, his, lamarckian, evolutionary, theory, soon, after, the, origin, was, published, in, 1859, critics, derided, his, description, of, a, struggle, for, existence, as, a, malthusian, justification, for, the, english, industrial, capitalism, of, the, time, the, term, darwinism, was, used, for, the, evolutionary, ideas, of, others, including, spencer, s, survival, of, the, fittest, as, free, market, progress, and, ernst, haeckel, s, polygenistic, ideas, of, human, development, writers, used, natural, selection, to, argue, for, various, often, contradictory, ideologies, such, as, laissez, faire, dog, eat, dog, capitalism, colonialism, and, imperialism, however, darwin, s, holistic, view, of, nature, included, dependence, of, one, being, on, another, thus, pacifists, socialists, liberal, social, reformers, and, anarchists, such, as, peter, kropotkin, stressed, the, value, of, co, operation, over, struggle, within, a, species, darwin, himself, insisted, that, social, policy, should, not, simply, be, guided, by, concepts, of, struggle, and, selection, in, nature, after, the, 1880s, a, eugenics, movement, developed, on, ideas, of, biological, inheritance, and, for, scientific, justification, of, their, ideas, appealed, to, some, concepts, of, darwinism, in, britain, most, shared, darwin, s, cautious, views, on, voluntary, improvement, and, sought, to, encourage, those, with, good, traits, in, positive, eugenics, during, the, eclipse, of, darwinism, a, scientific, foundation, for, eugenics, was, provided, by, mendelian, genetics, negative, eugenics, to, remove, the, feebleminded, were, popular, in, america, canada, and, australia, and, eugenics, in, the, united, states, introduced, compulsory, sterilisation, laws, followed, by, several, other, countries, subsequently, nazi, eugenics, brought, the, field, into, disrepute, the, term, social, darwinism, was, used, infrequently, from, around, the, 1890s, but, became, popular, as, a, derogatory, term, in, the, 1940s, when, used, by, richard, hofstadter, to, attack, the, laissez, faire, conservatism, of, those, like, william, graham, sumner, who, opposed, reform, and, socialism, since, then, it, has, been, used, as, a, term, of, abuse, by, those, opposed, to, what, they, think, are, the, moral, consequences, of, evolution, darwin, was, a, prolific, writer, even, without, the, publication, of, his, works, on, evolution, he, would, have, had, a, considerable, reputation, as, the, author, of, the, voyage, of, the, beagle, as, a, geologist, who, had, published, extensively, on, south, america, and, had, solved, the, puzzle, of, the, formation, of, coral, atolls, and, as, a, biologist, who, had, published, the, definitive, work, on, barnacles, while, on, the, origin, of, species, dominates, perceptions, of, his, work, the, descent, of, man, and, the, expression, of, the, emotions, in, man, and, animals, had, considerable, impact, and, his, books, on, plants, including, the, power, of, movement, in, plants, were, innovative, studies, of, great, importance, as, was, his, final, work, on, the, formation, of, vegetable, mould, through, the, action, of, worms, i, robert, fitzroy, was, to, become, known, after, the, voyage, for, biblical, literalism, but, at, this, time, he, had, considerable, interest, in, lyell, s, ideas, and, they, met, before, the, voyage, when, lyell, asked, for, observations, to, be, made, in, south, america, fitzroy, s, diary, during, the, ascent, of, the, river, santa, cruz, in, patagonia, recorded, his, opinion, that, the, plains, were, raised, beaches, but, on, return, newly, married, to, a, very, religious, lady, he, recanted, these, ideas, browne, 1995, pp, 186, 414, ii, in, the, section, morphology, of, chapter, xiii, of, on, the, origin, of, species, darwin, commented, on, homologous, bone, patterns, between, humans, and, other, mammals, writing, what, can, be, more, curious, than, that, the, hand, of, a, man, formed, for, grasping, that, of, a, mole, for, digging, the, leg, of, the, horse, the, paddle, of, the, porpoise, and, the, wing, of, the, bat, should, all, be, constructed, on, the, same, pattern, and, should, include, the, same, bones, in, the, same, relative, positions, and, in, the, concluding, chapter, the, framework, of, bones, being, the, same, in, the, hand, of, a, man, wing, of, a, bat, fin, of, the, porpoise, and, leg, of, the, horse, at, once, explain, themselves, on, the, theory, of, descent, with, slow, and, slight, successive, modifications, iii, 1, 2, 3, in, on, the, origin, of, species, darwin, mentioned, human, origins, in, his, concluding, remark, that, in, the, distant, future, i, see, open, fields, for, far, more, important, researches, psychology, will, be, based, on, a, new, foundation, that, of, the, necessary, acquirement, of, each, mental, power, and, capacity, by, gradation, light, will, be, thrown, on, the, origin, of, man, and, his, history, in, chapter, vi, difficulties, on, theory, he, referred, to, sexual, selection, i, might, have, adduced, for, this, same, purpose, the, differences, between, the, races, of, man, which, are, so, strongly, marked, i, may, add, that, some, little, light, can, apparently, be, thrown, on, the, origin, of, these, differences, chiefly, through, sexual, selection, of, a, particular, kind, but, without, here, entering, on, copious, details, my, reasoning, would, appear, frivolous, in, the, descent, of, man, of, 1871, darwin, discussed, the, first, passage, during, many, years, i, collected, notes, on, the, origin, or, descent, of, man, without, any, intention, of, publishing, on, the, subject, but, rather, with, the, determination, not, to, publish, as, i, thought, that, i, should, thus, only, add, to, the, prejudices, against, my, views, it, seemed, to, me, sufficient, to, indicate, in, the, first, edition, of, my, origin, of, species, that, by, this, work, light, would, be, thrown, on, the, origin, of, man, and, his, history, and, this, implies, that, man, must, be, included, with, other, organic, beings, in, any, general, conclusion, respecting, his, manner, of, appearance, on, this, earth, in, a, preface, to, the, 1874, second, edition, he, added, a, reference, to, the, second, point, it, has, been, said, by, several, critics, that, when, i, found, that, many, details, of, structure, in, man, could, not, be, explained, through, natural, selection, i, invented, sexual, selection, i, gave, however, a, tolerably, clear, sketch, of, this, principle, in, the, first, edition, of, the, origin, of, species, and, i, there, stated, that, it, was, applicable, to, man, iv, see, for, example, willa, volume, 4, charlotte, perkins, gilman, and, the, feminization, of, education, by, deborah, m, de, simone, gilman, shared, many, basic, educational, ideas, with, the, generation, of, thinkers, who, matured, during, the, period, of, intellectual, chaos, caused, by, darwin, s, origin, of, the, species, marked, by, the, belief, that, individuals, can, direct, human, and, social, evolution, many, progressives, came, to, view, education, as, the, panacea, for, advancing, social, progress, and, for, solving, such, problems, as, urbanisation, poverty, or, immigration, v, see, for, example, the, song, a, lady, fair, of, lineage, high, from, gilbert, and, sullivan, s, princess, ida, which, describes, the, descent, of, man, but, not, woman, from, apes, vi, darwin, s, belief, that, black, people, had, the, same, essential, humanity, as, europeans, and, had, many, mental, similarities, was, reinforced, by, the, lessons, he, had, from, john, edmonstone, in, 1826, early, in, the, beagle, voyage, darwin, nearly, lost, his, position, on, the, ship, when, he, criticised, fitzroy, s, defence, and, praise, of, slavery, darwin, 1958, p, 74, he, wrote, home, about, how, steadily, the, general, feeling, as, shown, at, elections, has, been, rising, against, slavery, what, a, proud, thing, for, england, if, she, is, the, first, european, nation, which, utterly, abolishes, it, i, was, told, before, leaving, england, that, after, living, in, slave, countries, all, my, opinions, would, be, altered, the, only, alteration, i, am, aware, of, is, forming, a, much, higher, estimate, of, the, negro, character, darwin, 1887, p, 246, regarding, fuegians, he, could, not, have, believed, how, wide, was, the, difference, between, savage, and, civilized, man, it, is, greater, than, between, a, wild, and, domesticated, animal, inasmuch, as, in, man, there, is, a, greater, power, of, improvement, but, he, knew, and, liked, civilised, fuegians, like, jemmy, button, it, seems, yet, wonderful, to, me, when, i, think, over, all, his, many, good, qualities, that, he, should, have, been, of, the, same, race, and, doubtless, partaken, of, the, same, character, with, the, miserable, degraded, savages, whom, we, first, met, here, darwin, 1845, pp, 205, 207, 208, in, the, descent, of, man, he, mentioned, the, similarity, of, fuegians, and, edmonstone, s, minds, to, europeans, when, arguing, against, ranking, the, so, called, races, of, man, as, distinct, species, he, rejected, the, ill, treatment, of, native, people, and, for, example, wrote, of, massacres, of, patagonian, men, women, and, children, every, one, here, is, fully, convinced, that, this, is, the, most, just, war, because, it, is, against, barbarians, who, would, believe, in, this, age, that, such, atrocities, could, be, committed, in, a, christian, civilized, country, darwin, 1845, p, 102,
