underpinned, his, adoption, of, its, approach, and, methods, to, revolutionise, the, quality, of, his, pottery, his, unique, glazes, began, to, distinguish, his, wares, from, anything, else, on, the, market, by, 1763, he, was, receiving, orders, from, the, highest, ranking, people, including, queen, charlotte, wedgwood, convinced, her, to, let, him, name, the, line, of, pottery, she, had,

globe, he, first, opened, a, warehouse, at, charles, street, mayfair, in, london, as, early, as, 1765, and, it, soon, became, an, integral, part, of, his, sales, organization, in, two, years, his, trade, had, outgrown, his, rooms, in, grosvenor, square, in, 1767, wedgwood, and, bentley, drew, up, an, agreement, to, divide, decorative, wares, between, them, the, domestic, wares, being, sold, on, wedgwood, s, behalf, a, special, display, room, was, built, to, beguile, the, fashionable, company, wedgwood, s, in, fact, had, become, one, of, the, most, fashionable, meeting, places, in, london, his, workers, had, to, work, day, and, night, to, satisfy, the, demand, and, the, crowds, of, visitors, showed, no, sign, of, abating, the, proliferating, decoration, the, exuberant, colours, and, the, universal, gilding, of, rococo, were, banished, the, splendours, of, baroque, became, distasteful, the, intricacies, of, chinoiserie, lost, their, favour, the, demand, was, for, purity, simplicity, and, antiquity, to, encourage, this, outward, spread, of, fashion, and, to, speed, it, on, its, way, wedgwood, set, up, warehouses, and, showrooms, at, bath, liverpool, and, dublin, in, addition, to, his, showrooms, at, etruria, and, in, westminster, great, care, was, taken, in, timing, the, openings, and, new, goods, were, held, back, to, increase, their, effect, the, most, important, of, wedgwood, s, early, achievements, in, vase, production, was, the, perfection, of, the, black, stoneware, body, which, he, called, basalt, this, body, could, imitate, the, colour, and, shapes, of, etruscan, or, greek, vases, which, were, being, excavated, in, italy, in, 1769, vases, was, all, the, cry, in, london, he, opened, a, new, factory, called, etruria, north, of, stoke, wedgwood, became, what, he, wished, to, be, vase, maker, general, to, the, universe, around, 1771, he, started, to, experiment, with, jasperware, but, he, did, not, advertise, this, new, product, for, a, couple, of, years, sir, george, strickland, 6th, baronet, was, asked, for, advice, on, getting, models, from, rome, gilding, was, to, prove, unpopular, and, around, 1772, wedgwood, reduced, the, amount, of, offensive, gilding, in, response, to, suggestions, from, sir, william, hamilton, when, english, society, found, the, uncompromisingly, naked, figure, of, the, classics, too, warm, for, their, taste, and, the, ardor, of, the, greek, gods, too, readily, apparent, wedgwood, was, quick, to, cloak, their, pagan, immodesty, gowns, for, the, girls, and, fig, leaves, for, the, gods, were, usually, sufficient, just, as, he, felt, that, his, flowerpots, would, sell, more, if, they, were, called, duchess, of, devonshire, flowerpots, his, creamware, more, if, called, queensware, so, he, longed, for, brown, james, wyatt, and, the, brothers, adam, to, lead, the, architect, in, the, use, of, his, chimneypieces, and, for, george, stubbs, to, lead, the, way, in, the, use, of, wedgwood, plaques, wedgwood, hoped, to, monopolise, the, aristocratic, market, and, thus, win, for, his, wares, a, special, social, cachet, that, would, filter, to, all, classes, of, society, wedgwood, fully, realised, the, value, of, such, a, lead, and, made, the, most, of, it, by, giving, his, pottery, the, name, of, its, patron, queensware, royal, pattern, russian, pattern, bedford, oxford, and, chetwynd, vases, for, instance, whether, they, owned, the, original, or, merely, possessed, a, wedgwood, copy, mattered, little, to, wedgwood, s, customers, in, 1773, they, published, the, first, ornamental, catalogue, an, illustrated, catalogue, of, shapes, a, plaque, in, wedgwood, s, blue, pottery, style, marking, the, site, of, his, london, showrooms, between, 1774, and, 1795, in, wedgwood,
