interest, in, the, sport, and, higher, revenues, for, many, tennis, venues, rising, revenues, led, to, exploding, prize, money, when, federer, first, won, the, australian, open, in, 2004, he, earned, 985, 000, when, he, won, in, 2018, the, prize, had, increased, to, aud, 4, million, federer, s, versatility, has, been, described, by, jimmy, connors, as, follows, in, an, era, of, specialists, you, re, either, a, clay, court, specialist, a, grass, court, specialist, or, a, hard, court, specialist, or, you, re, roger, federer, an, elite, athlete, federer, was, an, all, court, all, around, player, known, for, his, speed, fluid, style, of, play, and, exceptional, shot, making, federer, mainly, played, from, the, baseline, but, was, also, comfortable, at, the, net, being, one, of, the, best, volleyers, in, the, game, he, had, a, powerful, accurate, smash, very, effectively, performed, rare, elements, of, professional, tennis, such, as, the, backhand, smash, and, skyhook, half, volley, jump, smash, slam, dunk, and, an, aggressive, serve, return, known, affectionately, as, sabr, sneak, attack, by, roger, a, half, volley, attack, on, an, opponent, s, second, serve, the, writer, david, foster, wallace, compared, the, brute, force, of, federer, s, forehand, motion, with, that, of, a, great, liquid, whip, while, john, mcenroe, referred, to, federer, s, forehand, as, the, greatest, shot, in, our, sport, federer, played, with, a, single, handed, backhand, which, gave, him, great, variety, he, employed, the, slice, occasionally, using, it, to, lure, his, opponent, to, the, net, and, deliver, a, passing, shot, federer, could, also, fire, topspin, winners, and, possessed, a, flick, backhand, with, which, he, could, generate, pace, with, his, wrist, the, flick, backhand, was, usually, used, to, pass, opponents, who, came, to, the, net, he, averaged, 90, of, service, games, won, throughout, his, career, often, coming, up, victorious, in, clutch, or, pressure, service, games, his, serve, was, difficult, to, read, as, he, always, used, a, similar, ball, toss, regardless, of, what, type, of, serve, he, was, going, to, hit, and, where, he, aimed, to, hit, it, he, was, often, able, to, produce, big, serves, on, key, points, in, a, match, his, first, serve, averaged, about, 200, km, h, 125, mph, but, he, was, capable, of, serving, at, 220, km, h, 137, mph, federer, was, also, accomplished, at, serve, and, volleying, and, employed, this, tactic, frequently, in, his, early, career, later, in, his, career, federer, added, the, drop, shot, to, his, arsenal, and, could, perform, a, well, disguised, drop, shot, off, both, wings, he, sometimes, used, a, between, the, legs, shot, which, is, colloquially, referred, to, as, a, tweener, or, hotdog, his, most, notable, use, of, the, tweener, was, in, the, semifinals, of, the, 2009, us, open, against, novak, djokovic, bringing, him, triple, match, point, federer, is, one, of, the, top, players, who, successfully, employed, the, squash, shot, after, stefan, edberg, joined, his, coaching, team, at, the, start, of, the, 2014, season, federer, played, a, more, offensive, game, attacking, the, net, more, often, and, improving, his, volleys, in, the, lead, up, to, the, 2015, us, open, federer, successfully, added, a, new, unique, shot, to, his, arsenal, called, sabr, sneak, attack, by, roger, in, which, he, charged, forward, to, receive, a, second, serve, and, his, a, return, on, the, service, line, with, the, switch, to, a, bigger, 97, inch, racket, from, a, 90, inch, racquet, federer, gained, easier, serving, and, better, defense, on, both, wings, with, fewer, shanks, however, he, experienced, diminished, control, and, power, on, his, forehand, slice, backhand, and, dropshot, federer, was, noted, for, his, cool, demeanor, and, emotional, control, on, the, court, most, of, his, professional, game, has, been, characterized, by, a, lack, of, outbursts, or, emotional, frustration, at, errors, giving, him, an, advantage, over, less, controlled, opponents, in, 2016, federer, declared, i, don, t, get, the, anxiety, during, a, match, so, much, anymore, you, know, to, throw, racquets, to, toss, balls, out, of, the, court, scream, and, stuff, i, almost, laugh, about, it, a, little, bit, today, when, an, opponent, does, it, but, that, s, something, for, me, that, s, not, a, problem, anymore, originally, lacking, self, control, as, a, junior, he, transformed, his, on, court, demeanor, to, become, well, liked, for, his, graciousness, despite, clearly, possessing, talent, from, a, young, age, federer, tended, to, allow, his, emotions, to, get, the, best, of, him, causing, his, game, to, falter, on, some, occasions, this, emotional, state, escalated, into, counter, productive, actions, such, as, racket, abuse, rarely, a, day, went, by, when, he, would, not, throw, his, racquet, against, the, fence, in, his, search, to, play, the, perfect, game, federer, later, confessed, to, having, been, a, hot, head, at, a, young, age, as, he, often, erupted, if, he, hit, a, dumb, shot, despite, this, fragile, temperament, federer, still, impressed, his, then, coach, adolf, kacovsky, who, said, that, during, defeats, he, never, gave, up, and, was, willing, to, learn, from, his, mistakes, afterwards, by, the, time, he, became, professional, federer, had, learned, to, temper, his, emotions, but, still, he, struggled, to, adapt, to, the, work, ethic, and, compromising, mindset, needed, to, be, a, competitive, professional, player, in, 2007, rod, laver, described, him, as, follows, one, thing, is, for, sure, he, s, the, best, player, of, his, time, and, one, of, the, most, admirable, champions, on, the, planet, that, s, certainly, something, worth, crowing, over, the, beauty, is, roger, federer, won, t, from, ages, 8, to, 10, federer, received, group, and, individual, training, from, veteran, czech, coach, adolf, kacovsky, reflecting, on, federer, kacovsky, said, the, private, lessons, which, were, partly, funded, by, the, club, roger, was, a, quick, learner, when, you, wanted, to, teach, him, something, new, he, was, able, to, pick, it, up, after, three, or, four, tries, while, others, in, the, group, needed, weeks, at, age, 10, federer, began, working, with, peter, carter, between, the, ages, of, 10, and, 14, federer, spent, more, time, with, carter, than, with, his, own, family, working, daily, on, all, aspects, of, his, game, building, on, the, work, done, earlier, by, kacovsky, carter, helped, perfect, federer, s, technique, along, with, teaching, him, the, strategy, and, psychology, required, to, play, the, game, to, a, high, level, federer, has, credited, carter, for, his, entire, technique, and, coolness, in, 1999, when, federer, decided, to, play, full, time, on, the, atp, tour, he, chose, peter, lundgren, rather, than, carter, as, his, traveling, coach, and, they, worked, together, until, the, end, of, 2003, before, eventually, splitting, on, 1, august, 2002, carter, died, in, a, car, crash, in, south, africa, according, to, his, autobiography, when, federer, learned, of, carter, s, death, he, was, never, so, upset, in, his, life, while, an, australian, newspaper, reported, when, federer, heard, the, news, he, left, his, hotel, and, ran, through, the, streets, bawling, and, hysterical, about, carter, s, funeral, federer, stated, any, defeat, in, tennis, is, nothing, compared, to, such, a, moment, his, death, had, a, deep, impact, on, federer, who, would, even, call, it, a, wake, up, call, before, winning, his, first, major, in, the, following, year, wimbledon, which, he, dedicated, to, carter, federer, s, playing, style, has, been, greatly, influenced, by, his, coaches, over, the, years, for, instance, he, has, credited, his, infamous, sabr, technique, to, his, coach, severin, l, thi, who, encouraged, him, to, develop, it, and, use, it, in, big, matches, his, other,
