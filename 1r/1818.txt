karl, theodor, wilhelm, weierstrass, v, a, r, s, t, r, s, t, r, s, german, weierstra, 31, october, 1815, 19, february, 1897, was, a, german, mathematician, often, cited, as, the, father, of, modern, analysis, despite, leaving, university, without, a, degree, he, studied, mathematics, and, trained, as, a, school, teacher, eventually, teaching, mathematics, physics, botany, and, gymnastics, he, later, received, an, honorary, doctorate, and, became, professor, of, mathematics, in, berlin, among, many, other, contributions, weierstrass, formalized, the, definition, of, the, continuity, of, a, function, and, complex, analysis, proved, the, intermediate, value, theorem, and, the, bolzano, weierstrass, theorem, and, used, the, latter, to, study, the, properties, of, continuous, functions, on, closed, bounded, intervals, weierstrass, was, born, into, a, roman, catholic, family, in, ostenfelde, a, village, near, ennigerloh, in, the, province, of, westphalia, weierstrass, was, the, son, of, wilhelm, weierstrass, a, government, official, and, theodora, vonderforst, both, of, whom, were, catholic, rhinelanders, his, interest, in, mathematics, began, while, he, was, a, gymnasium, student, at, the, theodorianum, in, paderborn, he, was, sent, to, the, university, of, bonn, upon, graduation, to, prepare, for, a, government, position, because, his, studies, were, to, be, in, the, fields, of, law, economics, and, finance, he, was, immediately, in, conflict, with, his, hopes, to, study, mathematics, he, resolved, the, conflict, by, paying, little, heed, to, his, planned, course, of, study, but, continuing, private, study, in, mathematics, the, outcome, was, that, he, left, the, university, without, a, degree, he, then, studied, mathematics, at, the, m, nster, academy, which, was, even, then, famous, for, mathematics, and, his, father, was, able, to, obtain, a, place, for, him, in, a, teacher, training, school, in, m, nster, later, he, was, certified, as, a, teacher, in, that, city, during, this, period, of, study, weierstrass, attended, the, lectures, of, christoph, gudermann, and, became, interested, in, elliptic, functions, in, 1843, he, taught, in, deutsch, krone, in, west, prussia, and, from, 1848, he, taught, at, the, lyceum, hosianum, in, braunsberg, besides, mathematics, he, also, taught, physics, botany, and, gymnastics, weierstrass, may, have, had, an, illegitimate, child, named, franz, with, the, widow, of, his, friend, carl, wilhelm, borchardt, after, 1850, weierstrass, suffered, from, a, long, period, of, illness, but, was, able, to, publish, mathematical, articles, that, brought, him, fame, and, distinction, the, university, of, k, nigsberg, conferred, an, honorary, doctor, s, degree, on, him, on, 31, march, 1854, in, 1856, he, took, a, chair, at, the, gewerbeinstitut, in, berlin, an, institute, to, educate, technical, workers, which, would, later, merge, with, the, bauakademie, to, form, the, technische, hochschule, in, charlottenburg, now, technische, universit, t, berlin, in, 1864, he, became, professor, at, the, friedrich, wilhelms, universit, t, berlin, which, later, became, the, humboldt, universit, t, zu, berlin, in, 1870, at, the, age, of, fifty, five, weierstrass, met, sofia, kovalevsky, whom, he, tutored, privately, after, failing, to, secure, her, admission, to, the, university, they, had, a, fruitful, intellectual, and, kindly, personal, relationship, that, far, transcended, the, usual, teacher, student, relationship, he, mentored, her, for, four, years, and, regarded, her, as, his, best, student, helping, to, secure, a, doctorate, for, her, from, heidelberg, university, without, the, need, for, an, oral, thesis, defense, he, was, immobile, for, the, last, three, years, of, his, life, and, died, in, berlin, from, pneumonia, from, 1870, until, her, death, in, 1891, kovalevsky, corresponded, with, weierstrass, upon, learning, of, her, death, he, burned, her, letters, about, 150, of, his, letters, to, her, have, been, preserved, professor, reinhard, b, lling, discovered, the, draft, of, the, letter, she, wrote, to, weierstrass, when, she, arrived, in, stockholm, in, 1883, upon, her, appointment, as, privatdocent, at, stockholm, university, weierstrass, was, interested, in, the, soundness, of, calculus, and, at, the, time, there, were, somewhat, ambiguous, definitions, of, the, foundations, of, calculus, so, that, important, theorems, could, not, be, proven, with, sufficient, rigour, although, bolzano, had, developed, a, reasonably, rigorous, definition, of, a, limit, as, early, as, 1817, and, possibly, even, earlier, his, work, remained, unknown, to, most, of, the, mathematical, community, until, years, later, and, many, mathematicians, had, only, vague, definitions, of, limits, and, continuity, of, functions, the, basic, idea, behind, delta, epsilon, proofs, is, arguably, first, found, in, the, works, of, cauchy, in, the, 1820s, cauchy, did, not, clearly, distinguish, between, continuity, and, uniform, continuity, on, an, interval, notably, in, his, 1821, cours, d, analyse, cauchy, argued, that, the, pointwise, limit, of, pointwise, continuous, functions, was, itself, pointwise, continuous, a, statement, that, is, false, in, general, the, correct, statement, is, rather, that, the, uniform, limit, of, continuous, functions, is, continuous, also, the, uniform, limit, of, uniformly, continuous, functions, is, uniformly, continuous, this, required, the, concept, of, uniform, convergence, which, was, first, observed, by, weierstrass, s, advisor, christoph, gudermann, in, an, 1838, paper, where, gudermann, noted, the, phenomenon, but, did, not, define, it, or, elaborate, on, it, weierstrass, saw, the, importance, of, the, concept, and, both, formalized, it, and, applied, it, widely, throughout, the, foundations, of, calculus, the, formal, definition, of, continuity, of, a, function, as, formulated, by, weierstrass, is, as, follows, f, x, displaystyle, displaystyle, f, x, is, continuous, at, x, x, 0, displaystyle, displaystyle, x, x, 0, if, 0, 0, displaystyle, displaystyle, forall, varepsilon, 0, exists, delta, 0, such, that, for, every, x, displaystyle, x, in, the, domain, of, f, displaystyle, f, x, x, 0, f, x, f, x, 0, displaystyle, displaystyle, x, x, 0, delta, rightarrow, f, x, f, x, 0, varepsilon, in, simple, english, f, x, displaystyle, displaystyle, f, x, is, continuous, at, a, point, x, x, 0, displaystyle, displaystyle, x, x, 0, if, for, each, x, displaystyle, x, close, enough, to, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, the, function, value, f, x, displaystyle, f, x, is, very, close, to, f, x, 0, displaystyle, f, x, 0, where, the, close, enough, restriction, typically, depends, on, the, desired, closeness, of, f, x, 0, displaystyle, f, x, 0, to, f, x, displaystyle, f, x, using, this, definition, he, proved, the, intermediate, value, theorem, he, also, proved, the, bolzano, weierstrass, theorem, and, used, it, to, study, the, properties, of, continuous, functions, on, closed, and, bounded, intervals, weierstrass, also, made, advances, in, the, field, of, calculus, of, variations, using, the, apparatus, of, analysis, that, he, helped, to, develop, weierstrass, was, able, to, give, a, complete, reformulation, of, the, theory, that, paved, the, way, for, the, modern, study, of, the, calculus, of, variations, among, several, axioms, weierstrass, established, a, necessary, condition, for, the, existence, of, strong, extrema, of, variational, problems, he, also, helped, devise, the, weierstrass, erdmann, condition, which, gives, sufficient, conditions, for, an, extremal, to, have, a, corner, along, a, given, extremum, and, allows, one, to, find, a, minimizing, curve, for, a, given, integral, the, lunar, crater, weierstrass, and, the, asteroid, 14100, weierstrass, are, named, after, him, also, there, is, the, weierstrass, institute, for, applied, analysis, and, stochastics, in, berlin
