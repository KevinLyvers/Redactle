cesare, another, of, his, relatives, the, beautiful, and, rich, charlotte, d, albret, whom, cesare, married, at, blois, on, 13, may, 1499, the, marriage, produced, a, complete, volta, facie, in, pope, alexander, he, became, an, open, partisan, of, the, french, and, venice, and, accepted, their, goal, the, destruction, of, the, sforza, hold, on, milan, on, 14, july, cardinal, ascanio, sforza, della, rovere, s, sworn, enemy, fled, rome, with, all, his, property, and, friends, meanwhile, the, french, army, crossed, the, alps, and, captured, alessandria, in, piedmont, on, 1, september, 1499, lodovico, il, moro, fled, milan, and, on, 6, september, the, city, surrendered, to, the, french, cardinal, giuliano, was, in, the, king, s, entourage, when, he, entered, milan, on, 6, october, pope, alexander, then, turned, his, attention, stimulated, by, the, venetians, to, the, threat, of, the, ottoman, turks, in, the, autumn, of, 1499, he, called, for, a, crusade, and, sought, aid, and, money, from, all, christendom, the, rulers, of, europe, paid, little, attention, but, to, show, his, sincerity, alexander, imposed, a, tithe, on, all, the, residents, of, the, papal, states, and, a, tithe, on, the, clergy, of, the, entire, world, a, list, of, cardinals, and, their, incomes, drawn, up, for, the, occasion, shows, that, cardinal, della, rovere, was, the, second, richest, cardinal, with, an, annual, income, of, 20, 000, ducats, another, break, in, relations, between, pope, alexander, and, cardinal, giuliano, came, at, the, end, of, 1501, or, the, beginning, of, 1502, when, giuliano, was, transferred, from, the, bishopric, of, bologna, to, the, diocese, of, vercelli, on, 21, june, 1502, pope, alexander, sent, his, secretary, francesco, troche, trochia, and, cardinal, amanieu, d, albret, brother, in, law, of, cesare, borgia, to, savona, to, seize, cardinal, della, rovere, by, stealth, and, bring, him, back, to, rome, as, quickly, as, possible, and, turn, him, over, to, the,

february, he, died, there, poisoned, on, the, orders, of, alexander, vi, a, veteran, of, the, sacred, college, della, rovere, had, won, influence, for, the, election, of, pope, pius, iii, with, the, help, of, florentine, ruler, lorenzo, de, medici, in, spite, of, a, violent, temper, della, rovere, succeeded, by, dexterous, diplomacy, in, winning, the, support, of, cesare, borgia, whom, he, won, over, by, his, promise, of, money, and, continued, papal, backing, for, borgia, policies, in, the, romagna, this, election, was, in, ludwig, von, pastor, s, view, certainly, achieved, by, means, of, bribery, with, money, but, also, with, promises, giuliano, whom, the, popular, voice, seemed, to, indicate, as, the, only, possible, pope, was, as, unscrupulous, as, any, of, his, colleagues, in, the, means, which, he, employed, where, promises, and, persuasions, were, unavailing, he, did, not, hesitate, to, have, recourse, to, bribery, indeed, his, election, on, 1, november, 1503, took, only, a, few, hours, and, the, only, two, votes, he, did, not, receive, were, his, own, and, the, one, of, georges, d, amboise, his, most, vigorous, opponent, and, the, favourite, of, the, french, monarchy, in, the, end, as, in, all, papal, elections, the, vote, is, made, unanimous, after, the, leading, candidate, has, achieved, the, required, number, of, votes, for, election, giuliano, della, rovere, took, the, name, julius, only, used, by, a, single, fourth, century, predecessor, julius, i, and, was, pope, for, nine, years, from, 1503, to, 1513, from, the, beginning, julius, ii, set, out, to, defeat, the, various, powers, that, challenged, his, temporal, authority, in, a, series, of, complicated, stratagems, he, first, succeeded, in, rendering, it, impossible, for, the, borgias, to, retain, their, power, over, the, papal, states, indeed, on, the, day, of, his, election, he, issued, a, damnatio, memoriae, declaring, i, will, not, live, in, the, same, rooms, as, the, borgias, lived, he, desecrated, the, holy, church, as, none, before, he, usurped, the, papal, power, by, the, devil, s, aid, and, i, forbid, under, the, pain, of, excommunication, anyone, to, speak, or, think, of, borgia, again, his, name, and, memory, must, be, forgotten, it, must, be, crossed, out, of, every, document, and, memorial, his, reign, must, be, obliterated, all, paintings, made, of, the, borgias, or, for, them, must, be, covered, over, with, black, crepe, all, the, tombs, of, the, borgias, must, be, opened, and, their, bodies, sent, back, to, where, they, belong, to, spain, others, indicate, that, his, decision, was, taken, on, 26, november, 1507, not, in, 1503, the, borgia, apartments, were, turned, to, other, uses, the, sala, de, papi, was, redecorated, by, two, pupils, of, raphael, by, order, of, pope, leo, x, the, rooms, were, used, to, accommodate, emperor, charles, v, on, his, visit, to, the, vatican, after, the, sack, of, rome, 1527, and, subsequently, they, became, the, residence, of, the, cardinal, nephew, and, then, the, cardinal, secretary, of, state, julius, used, his, influence, to, reconcile, two, powerful, roman, families, the, orsini, and, colonna, decrees, were, made, in, the, interests, of, the, roman, nobility, in, whose, shoes, the, new, pope, now, stepped, being, thus, secure, in, rome, and, the, surrounding, country, he, set, himself, the, task, to, expel, the, republic, of, venice, from, faenza, rimini, and, the, other, towns, and, fortresses, of, italy, which, it, occupied, after, the, death, of, pope, alexander, in, 1504, finding, it, impossible, to, succeed, with, the, doge, of, venice, by, remonstrance, he, brought, about, a, union, of, the, conflicting, interests, of, france, and, the, holy, roman, empire, and, sacrificed, temporarily, to, some, extent, the, independence, of, italy, to, conclude, with, them, an, offensive, and, defensive, alliance, against, venice, the, combination, was, however, at, first, little, more, than, nominal, and, was, not, immediately, effective, in, compelling, the, venetians, to, deliver, up, more, than, a, few, unimportant, places, in, the, romagna, with, a, campaign, in, 1506, he, personally, led, an, army, to, perugia, and, bologna, freeing, the, two, papal, cities, from, their, despots, gian, paolo, baglioni, and, giovanni, ii, bentivoglio, in, december, 1503, julius, issued, a, dispensation, allowing, the, future, henry, viii, of, england, to, marry, catherine, of, aragon, catherine, had, previously, been, briefly, married, to, henry, s, older, brother, prince, arthur, who, had, died, but, henry, later, argued, that, she, had, remained, a, virgin, for, the, five, months, of, the, marriage, some, twenty, years, later, when, henry, was, attempting, to, wed, anne, boleyn, since, his, son, by, catherine, of, aragon, survived, only, a, few, days, and, two, of, her, sons, were, stillborn, and, therefore, he, had, no, male, heir, he, sought, to, have, his, marriage, annulled, claiming, that, the, dispensation, of, pope, julius, should, never, have, been, issued, the, retraction, of, the, dispensation, was, refused, by, pope, clement, vii, the, bull, entitled, ea, quae, pro, bono, pacis, issued, on, 24, january, 1506, confirmed, papal, approval, of, the, mare, clausum, policy, being, pursued, by, spain, and, portugal, amid, their, explorations, and, approved, the, changes, of, the, 1494, treaty, of, tordesillas, to, previous, papal, bulls, in, the, same, year, julius, ii, founded, the, swiss, guard, to, provide, a, constant, corps, of, soldiers, to, protect, the, pope, as, part, of, the, renaissance, program, of, reestablishing, the, glory, of, antiquity, for, the, christian, capital, rome, julius, ii, took, considerable, effort, to, present, himself, as, a, sort, of, emperor, pope, capable, of, leading, a, latin, christian, empire, on, palm, sunday, 1507, julius, ii, entered, rome, both, as, a, second, julius, caesar, heir, to, the, majesty, of, rome, s, imperial, glory, and, in, the, likeness, of, christ, whose, vicar, the, pope, was, and, who, in, that, capacity, governed, the, universal, roman, church, julius, who, modeled, himself, after, his, namesake, caesar, would, personally, lead, his, army, across, the, italian, peninsula, under, the, imperial, war, cry, drive, out, the, barbarians, yet, despite, the, imperial, rhetoric, the, campaigns, were, highly, localized, perugia, voluntarily, surrendered, in, march, 1507, to, direct, control, as, it, had, always, been, within, the, papal, states, it, was, in, these, endeavors, he, had, enlisted, french, mercenaries, urbino, s, magnificent, ducal, palace, was, infiltrated, by, french, soldiers, in, the, pay, of, the, margrave, of, mantua, the, montefeltro, conspiracy, against, his, loyal, cousins, earned, the, occupying, armies, the, pope, s, undying, hatred, julius, relied, upon, guidobaldo, s, help, to, raise, his, nephew, and, heir, francesco, maria, della, rovere, the, intricate, web, of, nepotism, helped, secure, the, italian, papacy, moreover, the, pope, s, interest, in, urbino, was, widely, known, in, the, french, court, julius, left, a, spy, at, the, urbino, palace, possibly, galeotto, franciotti, della, rovere, cardinal, of, san, pietro, to, watch, the, mantua, stables, in, total, secret, the, secular, progress, of, the, papal, curia, was, growing, in, authority, and, significance, in, rome, the, pope, watched, from, his, private, chapel, to, see, how, his, court, behaved, this, was, an, age, of, renaissance, conspiracy, in, addition, to, an, active, military, policy, the, new, pope, personally, led, troops, into, battle, on, at, least, two, occasions, the, first, to, expel, giovanni, bentivoglio, from, bologna, 17, august, 1506, 23, march, 1507, which, was, achieved, successfully, with, the, assistance, of, the, duchy, of, urbino, the, second, was, an, attempt, to, recover, the, duchy, of, ferrara, for, the, papal, states, 1, september, 1510, 29, june, 1512, in, 1508, julius, was, fortuitously, able, to, form, the, league, of, cambrai, with, king, louis, xii, of, france, maximilian, i, holy, roman, emperor, proclaimed, without, coronation, as, emperor, by, pope, julius, ii, at, trent, in, 1508, and, king, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, the, league, fought, against, the, republic, of, venice, among, other, things, julius, wanted, possession, of, venetian, romagna, emperor, maximilian, i, wanted, friuli, and, veneto, louis, xii, wanted, cremona, and, ferdinand, ii, desired, the, apulian, ports, this, war, was, a, conflict, in, what, was, collectively, known, as, the, italian, wars, in, the, spring, of, 1509, the, republic, of, venice, was, placed, under, an, interdict, by, julius, in, may, 1509, julius, sent, troops, to, fight, against, the, venetians, who, had, occupied, parts, of, the, romagna, winning, back, the, papal, states, in, the, decisive, battle, of, agnadello, near, cremona, during, the, war, of, the, holy, league, alliances, kept, changing, in, 1510, venice, and, france, switched, places, and, by, 1513, venice, had, joined, france, the, achievements, of, the, league, soon, outstripped, the, primary, intention, of, julius, in, one, single, battle, the, battle, of, agnadello, on, 14, may, 1509, the, dominion, of, venice, in, italy, was, practically, lost, to, the, pope, neither, the, king, of, france, nor, the, holy, roman, emperor, was, satisfied, with, merely, effecting, the, purposes, of, the, pope, the, latter, found, it, necessary, to, enter, into, an, arrangement, with, the, venetians, to, defend, himself, from, those, who, immediately, before, had, been, his, allies, the, venetians, on, making, humble, submission, were, absolved, at, the, beginning, of, 1510, and, shortly, afterward, france, was, placed, under, papal, interdict, attempts, to, cause, a, rupture, between, france, and, england, proved, unsuccessful, on, the, other, hand, at, a, synod, convened, by, louis, at, tours, in, september, 1510, the, french, bishops, withdrew, from, papal, obedience, and, resolved, with, the, emperor, s, co, operation, to, seek, dethronement, of, the, pope, with, some, courage, julius, marched, his, army, to, bologna, and, then, against, the, french, to, mirandola, in, november, 1511, a, council, met, at, pisa, called, by, rebel, cardinals, with, support, from, the, french, king, and, the, empire, they, demanded, the, deposition, of, julius, ii, he, refused, to, shave, showing, utter, contempt, for, the, hated, french, occupation, per, vendicarsi, et, diceva, anco, fuora, scazato, el, re, ludovico, franza, d, italia, whereupon, julius, entered, into, another, holy, league, of, 1511, in, alliance, with, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, and, the, venetians, he, conspired, against, the, gallican, liberties, in, a, short, time, both, henry, viii, of, england, 1509, 47, and, maximilian, i, joined, the, holy, league, of, 1511, against, france, ferdinand, of, aragon, now, recognized, naples, as, a, papal, fief, invested, in, 1511, and, therefore, julius, ii, now, regarded, france, as, the, main, foreign, power, in, the, italian, peninsula, hostile, to, papal, interests, louis, xii, defeated, the, alliance, at, battle, of, ravenna, on, 11, april, 1512, when, a, desperate, battle, felled, over, 20, 000, men, in, a, bloodbath, the, pope, commanded, his, protege, a, newly, released, young, cardinal, medici, to, re, take, florence, with, a, spanish, army, the, rescue, of, the, city, on, 1, september, 1512, saved, rome, from, another, invasion, ousting, piero, soderini, and, returning, the, dynastic, rule, of, the, medici, julius, had, seemingly, restored, fortuna, or, control, by, exercising, his, manly, vertu, just, as, machiavelli, wrote, this, re, asserted, a, strong, relation, between, florence, and, rome, a, lasting, legacy, of, julius, ii, yet, machiavelli, and, his, methods, would, not, outlast, julius, papacy, julius, hired, swiss, mercenaries, to, fight, against, the, french, in, milan, in, may, 1512, causing, the, french, army, to, withdraw, across, the, alps, into, savoy, the, papacy, gained, control, of, parma, and, piacenza, in, central, italy, with, the, french, out, of, italy, and, spain, recognizing, naples, as, a, papal, fief, a, congress, was, held, in, mantua, by, julius, ii, to, declare, the, liberation, of, the, peninsula, nevertheless, although, julius, had, centralized, and, expanded, the, papal, states, he, was, far, from, realizing, his, dream, of, an, independent, italian, kingdom, italy, was, not, at, peace, either, the, french, were, preparing, new, campaigns, to, reconquer, milan, and, julius, ii, confessed, to, a, venetian, ambassador, a, plan, to, invest, his, counselor, luigi, d, aragona, with, the, kingdom, of, naples, in, order, to, end, spanish, presence, in, the, south, in, fact, after, the, death, of, julius, war, would, resume, and, the, treaties, of, noyon, and, brussels, in, 1516, would, again, divide, much, of, italy, between, french, and, spanish, influence, in, may, 1512, a, general, or, ecumenical, council, the, fifth, council, of, the, lateran, was, held, in, rome, according, to, an, oath, taken, on, his, election, to, observe, the, electoral, capitulations, of, the, conclave, of, october, 1503, julius, had, sworn, to, summon, a, general, council, but, it, had, been, delayed, he, affirmed, because, of, the, occupation, of, italy, by, his, enemies, the, real, stimulus, came, from, a, false, council, which, took, place, in, 1511, later, called, the, conciliabulum, pisanum, inspired, by, louis, xii, and, maximilian, i, as, a, tactic, to, weaken, julius, threatening, to, depose, him, julius, reply, was, the, issuing, of, the, bull, non, sini, gravi, of, 18, july, 1511, which, fixed, the, date, of, 19, april, 1512, for, the, opening, of, his, own, council, the, council, actually, convened, on, 3, may, 1512, and, paris, de, grassis, reports, that, the, crowd, at, the, basilica, was, estimated, at, 50, 000, it, held, its, first, working, session, on, 10, may, in, the, third, plenary, session, on, 3, december, 1512, julius, attended, though, ill, but, he, wanted, to, witness, and, receive, the, formal, adhesion, of, emperor, maximilian, to, the, lateran, council, and, his, repudiation, of, the, conciliabulum, pisanum, this, was, one, of, julius, great, triumphs, the, pope, was, again, in, attendance, at, the, fourth, session, on, 10, december, this, time, to, hear, the, accrediting, of, the, venetian, ambassador, as, the, serene, republic, s, representative, at, the, council, he, then, had, the, letter, of, king, louis, xi, of, 27, november, 1461, in, which, he, announced, the, revocation, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, read, out, to, the, assembly, and, demanded, that, all, persons, who, accepted, the, pragmatic, sanction, appear, before, the, council, within, sixty, days, to, justify, their, conduct, this, was, directed, against, the, current, french, king, louis, xii, the, fifth, session, was, held, on, 16, february, but, pope, julius, was, too, ill, to, attend, cardinal, raffaele, riario, the, dean, of, the, college, of, cardinals, and, bishop, of, ostia, presided, the, bishop, of, como, scaramuccia, trivulzio, then, read, from, the, pulpit, a, papal, bull, si, summus, rerum, dated, that, very, day, and, containing, within, its, text, the, complete, bull, of, 14, january, 1505, cum, tam, divino, the, bull, was, submitted, to, the, council, fathers, for, their, consideration, and, ratification, julius, wanted, to, remind, everyone, of, his, legislation, on, papal, conclaves, in, particular, against, simony, and, to, fix, his, regulations, firmly, in, canon, law, so, that, they, could, not, be, dispensed, or, ignored, julius, was, fully, aware, that, his, death, was, imminent, and, wished, to, establish, a, major, reform, in, his, final, days, though, he, had, been, a, witness, to, a, good, deal, of, simony, at, papal, conclaves, and, had, been, a, practitioner, himself, he, was, determined, to, stamp, out, this, abuse, the, reading, of, the, bull, cum, tam, divino, became, a, regular, feature, of, the, first, day, of, every, conclave, on, the, vigil, of, pentecost, in, may, 1512, pope, julius, aware, that, he, was, seriously, ill, and, that, his, health, was, failing, despite, comments, on, the, part, of, some, cardinals, about, how, well, he, looked, remarked, to, paris, de, grassis, they, are, flattering, me, i, know, better, my, strength, diminishes, from, day, to, day, and, i, cannot, live, much, longer, therefore, i, beg, you, not, to, expect, me, at, vespers, or, at, mass, from, henceforth, nonetheless, he, continued, his, restless, activities, including, masses, visits, to, churches, and, audiences, on, the, morning, of, 24, june, paris, found, the, pope, to, be, very, weak, on, christmas, eve, julius, ordered, paris, to, summon, the, college, of, cardinals, and, the, sacristan, of, the, apostolic, palace, since, he, was, so, ill, that, he, did, not, expect, to, be, able, to, stay, alive, very, long, from, then, until, 6, january, he, was, confined, to, bed, and, most, of, the, time, with, a, fever, he, had, lost, his, appetite, but, the, doctors, were, unable, to, diagnose, his, languor, on, 4, february, he, had, an, extensive, conversation, with, paris, concerning, the, arrangements, for, his, funeral, pope, julius, was, reported, to, be, seriously, ill, in, a, dispatch, received, in, venice, on, 10, february, 1513, he, received, holy, communion, and, was, granted, the, plenary, indulgence, on, the, morning, of, 19, february, according, to, the, venetian, ambassador, on, the, 20th, according, to, paris, de, grassis, he, received, holy, communion, from, the, hands, of, cardinal, raffaele, riario, the, camerlengo, he, died, of, a, fever, in, the, night, of, 20, 21, february, 1513, on, the, evening, of, 21, february, paris, de, grassis, conducted, the, funeral, of, julius, ii, even, though, the, canons, of, the, vatican, basilica, and, the, beneficiati, refused, to, cooperate, the, body, was, placed, for, a, time, at, the, altar, of, saint, andrew, in, the, basilica, and, was, then, carried, by, the, imperial, ambassador, the, papal, datary, and, two, of, paris, assistants, to, the, altar, of, the, chapel, of, pope, sixtus, where, the, vicar, of, the, vatican, basilica, performed, the, final, absolution, at, the, third, hour, of, the, evening, the, body, was, laid, in, a, sepulcher, between, the, altar, and, the, wall, of, the, tribune, despite, the, fact, that, the, so, called, tomb, of, pope, julius, ii, by, michelangelo, is, in, san, pietro, in, vincoli, in, rome, julius, is, in, fact, buried, in, st, peter, s, basilica, michelangelo, s, tomb, was, not, completed, until, 1545, and, represents, a, much, abbreviated, version, of, the, planned, original, which, was, initially, intended, for, the, new, st, peter, s, basilica, his, remains, lay, alongside, his, uncle, pope, sixtus, iv, but, were, later, desecrated, during, the, sack, of, rome, in, 1527, today, both, men, lie, in, st, peter, s, basilica, on, the, floor, in, front, of, the, monument, to, pope, clement, x, a, simple, marble, tombstone, marks, the, site, julius, ii, was, succeeded, by, pope, leo, x, in, 1484, cardinal, giuliano, della, rovere, had, begun, negotiations, to, persuade, marquis, francesco, gonzaga, of, mantua, to, allow, andrea, mantegna, to, come, to, rome, which, finally, bore, fruit, in, 1488, mantegna, was, given, the, commission, to, decorate, the, chapel, of, the, belvedere, for, pope, innocent, viii, on, which, he, spent, two, years, beyond, julius, ii, s, political, and, military, achievements, he, enjoys, a, title, to, honor, in, his, patronage, of, art, architecture, and, literature, he, did, much, to, improve, and, beautify, the, city, early, in, his, papacy, julius, decided, to, revive, the, plan, for, replacing, the, dilapidated, constantinian, basilica, of, st, peter, s, the, idea, was, not, his, but, originally, that, of, pope, nicholas, v, who, had, commissioned, designs, from, bernardo, rossellino, other, more, pressing, problems, distracted, the, attention, of, nicholas, and, subsequent, popes, but, julius, was, not, the, sort, of, person, to, be, distracted, once, he, had, settled, on, an, idea, in, this, case, for, the, greatest, building, on, earth, for, the, glory, of, saint, peter, and, himself, in, the, competition, for, a, building, plan, the, design, of, rossellino, was, immediately, rejected, as, being, out, of, date, a, second, design, was, submitted, by, giuliano, da, sangallo, an, old, friend, of, julius, who, had, worked, on, several, projects, for, him, before, including, the, palazzo, at, s, pietro, in, vincoli, and, who, had, left, rome, with, julius, when, he, fled, the, wrath, of, alexander, vi, in, 1495, through, cardinal, della, rovere, sangallo, had, presented, charles, viii, a, plan, for, a, palace, and, in, 1496, he, had, made, a, tour, of, the, architectural, monuments, of, provence,

historians, julius, was, manly, and, virile, an, energetic, man, of, action, whose, courage, saved, the, papacy, there, was, a, sense, that, war, caused, him, serious, illness, exhaustion, and,

the, celebrated, portrait, by, raphael, the, artist, whom, he, first, met, in, 1509, however, the, pope, only, wore, his, beard, from, 27, june, 1511, to, march, 1512, as, a, sign, of, mourning, at,

freedom, although, raphael, s, original, was, lost, it, was, thought, to, relate, closely, to, the, personal, iconography, of, stanza, della, segnatura, commissioned, by, pope, julius, himself, the, lateran, council, that, formed, the, holy, league, marked, a, high, point, in, his, personal, success, saved, by, an, allegory, to, the, expulsion, of, heliodorus, the, french, gone, julius,

sexual, reputation, survived, julius, and, the, accusation, continued, to, be, made, without, reservation, by, protestant, opponents, in, their, polemics, against, papism, and, catholic, decadence,
