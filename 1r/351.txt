sardonic, humor, his, ability, to, draw, caricatures, was, matched, only, by, his, ability, to, pin, someone, down, with, a, well, aimed, epigram, in, the, boarding, school, lermontov, proved, an, exceptional, student, he, excelled, at, the, 1828, examinations, he, recited, a, zhukovsky, poem, performed, a, violin, tude, and, won, the, first, prize, for, his, literary, essay, in, april, 1830,

by, vissarion, belinsky, nikolai, stankevich, and, alexander, hertzen, instead, he, drifted, towards, an, aristocracic, clique, but, even, this, cream, of, the, moscow, s, golden, youth, detested, the, young, man, for, being, too, aloof, while, still, giving, him, credit, for, having, charisma, everyone, could, see, that, lermontov, was, obnoxious, rough, and, daring, and, yet, there, was, something, alluring, in, his, firm, moroseness, fellow, student, wistengof, admitted, attending, lectures, faithfully, lermontov, would, often, read, a, book, in, the, corner, of, the, auditorium, and, never, took, part, in, student, life, making, exceptions, only, for, incidents, involving, grand, scale, trouble, making, he, took, an, active, part, in, the, notorious, 1831, malov, scandal, when, a, jeering, mob, drove, the, unpopular, professor, out, of, the, auditorium, but, wasn, t, formally, reprimanded, unlike, hertzen, who, found, himself, incarcerated, a, year, into, his, university, studies, the, final, tragic, act, of, the, family, discord, played, itself, out, deeply, affected, by, his, son, s, alienation, yuri, lermontov, left, arsenieva, s, house, for, good, only, to, die, a, short, time, later, of, consumption, his, father, s, death, under, such, circumstances, was, a, terrible, loss, for, mikhail, and, is, reflected, in, his, poems, forgive, me, will, we, meet, again, and, the, terrible, fate, of, father, and, son, for, some, time, he, seriously, considered, suicide, tellingly, each, of, his, early, dramas, menschen, und, leidenschaften, 1830, and, a, strange, man, 1831, ends, with, a, protagonist, killing, himself, all, the, while, judging, by, his, diaries, lermontov, maintained, a, keen, interest, in, european, politics, some, of, his,

later, lermontov, often, visited, us, and, talked, of, all, sort, of, things, personal, social, and, political, i, have, to, say, we, hardly, understood, each, other, we, were, unpleasantly, surprised, by, the, chaotic, nature, of, his, views, which, were, rather, vague, he, appeared, to, be, a, low, brow, realist, unwilling, to, let, his, imagination, fly, which, was, strange, considering, how, high, his, poetry, soared, on, its, mighty, wings, he, mocked, some, of, the, government, s, reforms, the, ones, we, couldn, t, even, dream, of, in, our, poor, youth, certain, essays, promoting, the, most, progressive, european, ideas, which, we, were, so, enthusiastic, about, for, who, could, have, ever, thought, it, possible, for, such, things, to, be, published, in, russia, left, him, cold, when, approached, with, a, straightforward, question, he, either, kept, silent, or, tried, to, get, away, with, some, sarcastic, remark, the, more, we, knew, him, the, more, difficult, it, was, for, us, to, take, him, seriously, there, was, a, spark, of, original, thought, in, him, but, he, was, still, very, young, lermontov, s, journey, to, nizhny, took, four, months, he, visited, yelizavetgrad, then, stayed, in, moscow, and, saint, petersburg, to, enjoy, himself, at, dancing, parties, and, to, revel, in, his, immense, popularity, lermontov, s, deportation, to, the, caucasus, has, made, a, lot, of, fuss, and, turned, him, into, a, victim, which, did, a, lot, to, whip, up, his, fame, as, a, poet, people, consumed, his, caucasian, poems, greedily, on, return, he, was, met, with, enormous, warmth, in, the, capital, and, hailed, as, heir, to, pushkin, wrote, poet, andrey, muravyov, warmly, welcomed, at, the, houses, of, karamzin, alexandra, smirnova,

less, than, two, months, time, though, arsenyeva, ensured, his, transfer, to, the, petersburg, based, hussars, guard, regiment, at, this, point, in, petersburg, lermontov, started, working, on, a, hero, of, our, time, a, novel, which, later, earned, him, recognition, as, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, russian, prose, in, january, 1839, andrey, krayevsky, now, at, the, helm, of, otechestvennye, zapiski, invited, lermontov, to, become, a, regular, contributor, the, magazine, published, two, parts, of, the, novel, bela, and, the, fatalist, in, issues, 2, and, 4, respectively, the, rest, of, it, appeared, in, print, during, 1840, and, earned, the, author, widespread, acclaim, the, partially, autobiographical, story, describing, prophetically, a, duel, like, the, one, in, which, he, would, eventually, lose, his, life, consisted, of, five, closely, linked, tales, revolving, around, a, single, character, a, disenchanted, bored, and, doomed, young, nobleman, later, it, came, to, be, considered, a, pioneering, classic, of, russian, psychological, realism, shallow, pleasures, offered, by, saint, petersburg, s, high, society, had, started, to, wear, lermontov, down, his, bad, temper, growing, even, worse, what, an, extravagant, man, he, is, looks, like, he, s, heading, for, the, imminent, catastrophe, insolent, to, a, fault, dying, of, boredom, getting, vexed, by, his, own, frivolousness, but, having, no, will, to, break, free, from, these, surroundings, a, strange, kind, of, man, wrote, alexandra, smirnova, the, lady, in, waiting, and, saint, petersburg, fashionable, salon, hostess, lermontov, s, popularity, at, the, salons, of, princess, sofija, shcherbatova, and, of, countess, emilie, musin, pushkina, caused, a, lot, of, ill, feeling, among, men, vying, for, attention, of, these, two, most, popular, petersburg, society, girls, of, the, time, in, early, 1840, lermontov, insulted, one, of, these, men, ernest, de, barante, the, son, of, the, french, ambassador, in, the, presence, of, shcherbatova, de, barante, issued, a, challenge, the, duel, took, place, almost, at, the, exact, spot, where, pushkin, had, received, his, fatal, wound, by, tchernaya, retchka, lermontov, found, himself, slightly, injured, then, arrested, and, jailed, his, visitors, in, jail, included, vissarion, belinsky, an, avid, admirer, of, lermontov, s, poetry, who, like, many, continued, to, have, problems, with, making, sense, of, his, dual, personality, and, incongruous, difficult, character, due, to, the, patronage, of, the, guard, s, commander, grand, duke, mikhail, pavlovich, lermontov, received, only, a, mild, punishment, the, grand, duke, chose, to, interpret, the, de, barante, incident, as, a, feat, for, a, russian, officer, who, came, up, to, champion, the, honour, of, the, russian, army, with, the, tsar, s, initial, demand, for, three, months, imprisonment, dropped, lermontov, went, back, to, exile, in, the, caucasus, to, the, tengin,

it, made, its, way, as, a, final, entry, into, lermontov, s, first, book, of, verse, published, by, ilya, glazunov, co, in, october, 1840, and, became, one, of, his, best, loved, short, poems, in, early, may, 1840, lermontov, left, saint, petersburg, but, arrived, at, stavropol, only, on, 10, june, having, spent, a, whole, month, in, moscow, visiting, among, other, people, nikolai, gogol, to, whom, he, recited, his, then, new, poem, mtsyri, on, arrival, lermontov, re, joined, the, army, as, part, of, general, galafeyev, s, fighting, unit, on, the, left, flank, of, the, caucasian, front, the, left, flank, had, the, mission, of, disarming, the, chechen, fighters, led, by, imam, shamil, and, of, protecting, the, newly, formed, russian, cossack, settlement, between, the, kuban, and, laba, rivers, in, early, july, the, regiment, entered, chechnya, and, went, into, action, lermontov, according, to, the, official, report, has, been, charged, with, the, commandment, of, a, cossack, troopers, unit, whose, duty, it, was, to, head, into, the, enemy, first, he, became, immensely, popular, with, his, men, whom, regular, army, officers, referred, to, as, the, international, gang, of, reckless, thugs, among, officers, lermontov, had, his, admirers, and, detractors, generals, pavel, grabbe, and, apollon, galafeyev, both, praised, the, young, man, for, his, reckless, bravery, according, to, baron, rossilyon, though, lermontov, was, an, unpleasant, and, scornful, man, always, eager, to, seem, special, he, boasted, his, bravery, the, one, thing, one, was, not, supposed, to, be, that, proud, of, in, the, caucasus, where, bravery, was, business, as, usual, he, led, the, gang, of, dirty, thugs, who, without, ever, using, firearms, charged, chechen, auls, led, partisan, wars, and, were, calling, themselves, the, lermontov, army, in, july, 1840, the, russian, army, got, involved, in, a, fierce, battle, at, the, gekha, forest, there, lermontov, distinguished, himself, in, hand, to, hand, combat, at, the, battle, of, the, valerik, river, 11, july, 1840, the, basis, for, his, poem, valerik, lermontov, s, duty, was, to, lead, our, forefront, storm, troopers, and, inform, the, headquarters, of, the, advancement, which, in, itself, was, perilous, since, the, enemy, was, everywhere, around, in, the, forest, and, in, the, bushes, but, this, officer, defying, danger, did, an, excellent, job, he, showed, great, courage, and, was, always, amongst, those, who, d, break, into, the, enemy, lines, first, general, galafeyev, informed, general, grabbe, on, 8, october, 1840, in, early, 1841, arsenyeva, received, permission, from, the, minister, of, defense, count, kleinmichel, for, lermontov, to, visit, saint, petersburg, those, three, or, four, months, he, spent, in, the, capital, were, i, think, the, happiest, time, of, his, life, received, quite, ecstatically, by, the, high, society, each, morning, he, produced, some, beautiful, verse, and, hasted, to, recite, it, to, us, in, the, evening, in, this, warm, atmosphere, good, humour, awoke, in, him, again, he, was, always, coming, up, with, new, jokes, and, pranks, making, us, all, laugh, for, hours, on, end, yevdokiya, rostopchina, remembered, by, the, time, both, a, hero, of, our, time, and, poems, by, m, y, lermontov, had, been, published, lermontov, according, to, skabichevsky, started, to, treat, his, poetic, mission, seriously, looking, for, an, early, retirement, that, would, have, enabled, him, to, start, a, literary, career, he, was, making, plans, for, his, own, literary, journal, which, wouldn, t, follow, european, trends, unlike, in, lermontov, s, view, otechestvennye, zapiski, i, ve, learnt, a, lot, from, easterners, and, i, am, eager, to, delve, deeper, into, the, depth, of, an, eastern, mindset, which, remains, a, mystery, not, only, to, us, but, to, an, easterner, himself, the, east, is, a, bottomless, well, of, revelations, lermontov, was, telling, krayevsky, it, soon, became, clear, that, for, an, early, retirement, there, was, no, hope, besides, despite, general, grabbe, s, insistence, lermontov, s, name, had, been, dropped, from, the, list, of, officers, eligible, for, awards, in, february, 1841, an, incident, at, a, ball, launched, by, countess, alexandra, vorontsova, dashkova, when, lermontov, involuntarily, snubbed, the, tsar, s, two, daughters, caused, concern, among, the, imperial, family, and, in, the, high, military, ranks, it, transpired, that, upon, his, arrival, in, february, lermontov, had, failed, to, report, to, his, commanding, officer, as, was, required, going, instead, to, a, ball, a, grievous, breach, for, someone, serving, under, condition, of, punishment, in, april, count, kleinmichel, issued, an, order, for, him, to, leave, the, city, in, 24, hours, and, join, his, regiment, in, the, caucasus, lermontov, approached, a, seer, the, same, gypsy, woman, who, d, predicted, pushkin, s, death, from, a, white, man, s, hand, and, asked, if, the, time, would, ever, come, when, he, d, be, allowed, to, retire, you, will, get, your, retirement, but, of, such, a, kind, after, which, you, won, t, ask, for, more, she, responded, which, made, lermontov, laugh, heartily, after, visiting, moscow, where, he, produced, no, fewer, than, eight, poetic, pieces, of, invective, aimed, at, benckendorff, on, 9, may, 1841, lermontov, arrived, to, stavropol, introduced, himself, to, general, grabbe, and, asked, for, permission, to, stay, in, the, town, then, on, a, whim, he, changed, his, course, found, himself, in, pyatigorsk, and, sent, his, seniors, a, letter, informing, them, of, his, having, fallen, ill, the, regiment, s, special, commission, recommended, him, treatment, at, mineralnye, vody, in, the, caucasian, mineral, waters, region, what, he, did, instead, was, embark, upon, the, several, weeks, spree, in, the, mornings, he, was, writing, but, the, more, he, worked, the, more, need, he, felt, to, unwind, in, the, evenings, skabichevsky, wrote, i, feel, i, m, left, with, very, little, of, my, life, the, poet, confessed, to, his, friend, a, merinsky, on, 8, july, a, week, before, his, death, in, pyatigorsk, lermontov, enjoyed, himself, feeding, on, his, notoriety, of, a, social, misfit, his, fame, as, a, poet, second, only, to, pushkin, and, his, success, with, a, hero, of, our, time, meanwhile, in, the, same, salons, his, cadet, school, friend, nikolai, martynov, dressed, as, a, native, circassian, wore, a, long, sword, affected, the, manners, of, a, romantic, hero, not, unlike, lermontov, s, grushnitsky, character, lermontov, teased, martynov, mercilessly, until, the, latter, couldn, t, stand, it, anymore, on, 25, july, 1841, martynov, challenged, his, offender, to, a, duel, the, fight, took, place, two, days, later, at, the, foot, of, mashuk, mountain, lermontov, allegedly, made, it, known, that, he, was, going, to, shoot, into, the, air, martynov, was, the, first, to, shoot, and, he, aimed, straight, into, the, heart, killing, his, opponent, on, the, spot, on, 30, july, lermontov, was, buried, without, military, honours, thousands, of, people, attended, the, ceremony, in, january, 1842, the, tsar, issued, an, order, allowing, the, coffin, to, be, transported, to, tarkhany, where, lermontov, was, laid, to, rest, at, the, family, cemetery, upon, receiving, the, news, his, grandmother, elizaveta, arsenyeva, suffered, a, minor, stroke, she, died, in, 1845, many, of, lermontov, s, verses, were, discovered, posthumously, in, his, notebooks, mikhail, lermontov, was, a, romantic, who, seemed, to, be, continuously, struggling, with, strong, passions, not, much, is, known, about, his, private, life, though, in, verses, dedicated, to, loved, ones, his, emotional, strife, seems, to, have, been, exaggerated, while, rumours, concerning, his, real, life, adventures, were, unreliable, and, occasionally, misguided, lermontov, fell, in, love, for, the, first, time, in, 1825, while, at, the, caucasus, a, girl, of, nine, being, the, object, of, his, desires, five, years, later, he, wrote, about, it, with, great, seriousness, seeing, this, early, awakening, of, romantic, feelings, as, a, sign, of, his, own, exclusiveness, so, early, in, life, at, ten, oh, this, mystery, this, paradise, lost, it, will, be, tormenting, my, mind, till, the, very, grave, sometimes, i, feel, funny, about, it, and, am, ready, to, laugh, at, this, first, love, of, mine, but, more, often, i, d, rather, cry, the, 15, year, old, wrote, in, a, diary, some, people, like, byron, think, early, love, is, akin, to, the, soul, prone, to, fine, arts, but, i, suppose, this, is, the, sign, of, soul, that, s, got, much, music, in, it, added, the, young, man, for, whom, the, english, poet, was, an, idol, at, sixteen, lermontov, fell, in, love, with, yekaterina, sushkova, 1812, 1868, a, friend, of, his, cousin, sasha, vereshchagina, whom, he, often, visited, in, srednikovo, village, yekaterina, failed, to, take, her, suitor, seriously, and, in, her, notes, described, him, thus, at, sashenka, s, i, often, met, her, cousin, a, clumsy, bow, legged, boy, of, 16, or, 17, with, reddened, eyes, which, were, clever, and, expressive, nevertheless, who, had, a, turned, up, nose, and, caustic, sneer, everybody, was, calling, him, just, michel, and, so, did, i, never, caring, about, his, second, name, assigned, to, be, my, errand, boy, he, was, carrying, my, hat, umbrella, and, gloves, leaving, them, behind, from, time, to, time, both, sashenka, and, i, while, giving, him, credit, for, his, intelligence, still, treated, him, like, a, baby, which, drove, him, mad, trying, to, be, perceived, as, a, serious, young, man, he, recited, pushkin, and, lamartine, and, never, parted, with, a, huge, volume, of, byron, several, 1830, 31, poems, by, lermontov, were, dedicated, to, sushkova, among, them, nishchy, the, beggar, man, and, blagodaryu, zovi, nadezhdu, snovidenyem, thank, you, to, call, the, hope, a, dream, in, 1830, lermontov, met, natalya, ivanova, 1813, 1875, daughter, of, a, moscow, playwright, fyodor, ivanov, and, had, an, affair, with, her, but, little, is, known, about, it, or, why, it, ended, judging, by, thirty, or, so, poems, addressed, to, n, f, i, she, chose, a, man, who, was, older, and, richer, much, to, the, distress, of, young, lermontov, who, took, this, as, a, betrayal, while, in, the, university, 16, year, old, lermontov, passionately, fell, in, love, with, another, cousin, of, his, varvara, lopukhina, also, sixteen, at, the, time, the, passion, was, said, to, be, reciprocal, but, pressed, by, her, family, varvara, went, on, to, marry, nikolai, bakhmetyev, a, wealthy, 37, year, old, aristocrat, lermontov, was, astounded, and, heartbroken, having, graduated, the, saint, petersburg, cadet, school, lermontov, embarked, upon, the, easy, going, lifestyle, of, a, reckless, young, hussar, as, he, imagined, it, should, be, mikhail, having, found, himself, the, very, soul, of, the, high, society, liked, to, entertain, himself, by, driving, young, women, mad, feigning, love, for, several, days, just, in, order, to, upset, matches, his, friend, and, flatmate, alexey, stolypin, wrote, in, december, 1834, lermontov, met, his, old, sweetheart, yekaterina, sushkova, at, a, ball, in, saint, petersburg, and, decided, to, have, a, revenge, first, he, seduced, then, after, a, while, dropped, her, making, the, story, public, relating, the, incident, in, a, letter, to, cousin, sasha, vereshchagina, he, blatantly, boasted, about, his, newly, found, reputation, of, a, don, juan, which, he, s, been, apparently, craving, for, i, happened, to, hear, several, of, lermontov, s, victims, complaining, about, his, treacherous, ways, and, couldn, t, restrict, myself, from, openly, laughing, at, the, comic, finales, he, used, to, invent, for, his, vile, casanova, feats, obviously, sympathetic, yevdokiya, rostopchina, recalled, by, 1840, lermontov, had, sickened, of, his, own, reputation, of, a, womanizer, and, a, cruel, heartbreaker, hunting, for, victims, at, balls, and, parties, and, leaving, them, behind, devastated, some, of, the, stories, were, myth, like, the, one, concerning, the, french, author, ad, le, hommaire, de, hell, well, publicised, at, the, time, and, related, at, some, length, by, skabichevsky, it, was, proved, later, to, have, never, happened, lermontov, s, love, for, lopukhina, bakhmetyeva, proved, to, be, the, only, deep, and, lasting, feeling, of, his, life, his, unfinished, drama, princess, ligovskaya, was, inspired, by, it, as, well, as, two, characters, in, a, hero, of, our, time, princess, mary, and, vera, in, his, 1982, biography, john, garrard, wrote, the, symbolic, relationship, between, love, and, suffering, is, of, course, a, favorite, romantic, paradox, but, for, lermontov, it, was, much, more, than, a, literary, device, he, was, unlucky, in, love, and, believed, he, always, would, be, fate, had, ordained, it, in, his, lifetime, mikhail, lermontov, published, only, one, slender, collection, of, poems, 1840, three, volumes, much, mutilated, by, censorship, were, published, a, year, after, his, death, in, 1841, yet, his, legacy, more, than, 30, large, poems, and, 600, minor, ones, a, novel, and, 5, dramas, was, immense, for, an, author, whose, literary, career, lasted, just, six, years, inspired, by, lord, byron, lermontov, started, to, write, poetry, at, the, age, of, 13, his, late, 1820s, poems, like, the, corsair, oleg, two, brothers, as, well, as, napoleon, 1830, borrowed, somewhat, from, pushkin, but, invariably, featured, a, byronic, hero, an, outcast, and, an, avenger, standing, firm, and, aloof, against, the, world, in, the, early, 1830s, lermontov, s, poetry, grew, more, introspective, and, intimate, even, diary, like, with, dates, often, serving, for, titles, but, even, his, love, lyric, addressed, to, yekaterina, sushkova, or, natalya, ivanova, could, not, be, relied, upon, as, autobiographical, driven, by, fantasies, it, dealt, with, passions, greatly, hypertrophied, protagonists, posing, high, and, mighty, in, the, center, of, the, universe, misunderstood, or, ignored, in, 1831, lermontov, s, poetry, the, reed, mermaid, the, wish, started, to, get, less, confessional, more, ballad, like, the, young, author, having, found, taste, for, plots, and, structures, was, trying, consciously, to, rein, in, his, emotional, urge, and, master, the, art, of, storytelling, critic, and, literature, historian, d, s, mirsky, regards, the, angel, 1831, as, the, first, of, lermontov, s, truly, great, poems, calling, it, arguably, the, finest, romantic, verse, ever, written, in, russian, at, least, two, other, poems, of, that, period, the, sail, and, the, hussar, were, later, rated, among, his, best, in, 1832, lermontov, tried, his, hand, at, prose, for, the, first, time, the, unfinished, novel, vadim, telling, the, story, of, the, 1773, 1775, yemelyan, pugachev, led, peasant, uprising, was, stylistically, flawed, and, short, on, ideas, yet, free, of, romantic, pathos, and, featuring, well, crafted, characters, as, well, as, scenes, from, peasant, life, it, marked, an, important, turn, for, the, author, now, evidently, intrigued, more, by, history, and, folklore, than, by, his, own, dreams, two, branches, of, lermontov, s, early, 1830s, poetry, one, dealing, with, the, russian, middle, age, history, another, with, the, caucasus, couldn, t, differ, more, the, former, were, stern, and, stark, featured, a, dark, reserved, hero, the, last, son, of, freedom, its, straightforward, storyline, developing, fast, the, latter, rich, with, ethnographical, side, issues, and, lavish, in, colourful, imagery, boasted, flamboyant, characters, ismail, bey, 1832, even, as, a, moscow, university, s, boarding, school, student, lermontov, was, a, socially, aware, young, man, his, the, turk, s, lament, 1829, expressed, strong, anti, establishment, feelings, this, place, where, a, man, suffers, from, slavery, and, chains, my, friend, this, is, my, fatherland, the, july, 15, 1830, poem, greeted, the, july, revolution, while, the, last, son, of, freedom, was, a, paean, to, obviously, idealized, novgorod, republic, but, lermontov, a, fiery, tribune, has, never, become, a, political, poet, full, of, inner, turmoil, and, anger, his, protagonists, were, riotous, but, never, rational, or, promoting, any, particular, ideology, the, cadet, school, seemed, to, have, stymied, in, lermontov, all, interests, except, one, for, wanton, debauchery, his, pornographic, and, occasionally, sadistic, cavalry, junkers, poems, which, circulated, in, manuscripts, marred, his, subsequent, reputation, so, much, so, that, admission, of, familiarity, with, lermontov, s, poetry, was, not, permissible, for, any, young, upper, class, woman, for, a, good, part, of, the, 19th, century, lermontov, churned, out, for, his, pals, whole, poems, in, improvisational, manner, dealing, with, things, which, were, apparently, part, of, their, barrack, and, camp, lifestyle, those, poems, which, i, ve, never, read, for, they, weren, t, intended, for, women, bear, all, the, mark, of, the, author, s, brilliant, fiery, temperament, as, people, who, ve, read, them, attest, yevdokiya, rostopchina,

times, the, author, tried, desperately, to, publish, it, close, to, french, melodrama, and, influenced, by, victor, hugo, and, alexander, dumas, but, also, owing, a, lot, to, shakespeare, griboyedov, and, pushkin, masquerade, featured, another, hero, whose, want, was, to, throw, a, gauntlet, to, the, unsympathetic, society, and, then, get, tired, of, his, own, conflicting, nature, but, was, interesting, mostly, for, its, realistic, sketches, of, the, high, society, life, which, lermontov, was, getting, more, and, more, critical, of, lermontov, s, fascination, with, byron, has, never, waned, having, made, the, english, pessimism, a, brand, of, his, own, he, s, imparted, it, a, strong, national, favour, to, produce, the, very, special, russian, spleen, which, has, been, there, always, in, the, russian, soul, devoid, of, cold, skepticism, or, icy, irony, lermontov, s, poetry, is, full, instead, of, typically, russian, contempt, for, life, and, material, values, this, mix, of, deep, melancholy, on, the, one, hand, and, wild, urge, for, freedom, on, the, other, could, be, found, only, in, russian, folk, songs, biographer, skabichevsky, wrote, in, 1836, 1838, lermontov,

banned, then, published, in, 1837, due, to, vasily, zhukovsky, s, efforts, was, unique, for, its, unexpected, authenticity, lermontov, who, haven, t, got, a, single, academic, source, to, rely, upon, entered, the, realm, of, folklore, as, a, real, master, and, totally, merged, with, its, spirit, according, to, belinsky, lermontov, s, cossack, lullaby, went, the, whole, round, from, the, original, folklore, source, to, literature, and, from, literature, to, living, folklore, for, one, and, a, half, centuries, people, have, performed, these, literary, lullabies, in, real, lulling, situations, according, to, valentin, golovin, death, of, the, poet, 1837, arguably, the, strongest, political, declaration, of, its, time, its, last, two, lines, and, all, of, your, black, blood, won, t, be, enough, to, expiate, the, poet, s, pure, blood, construed, by, some, as, a, direct, call, for, violence, made, lermontov, not, just, famous, but, almost, worshipped, as, a, true, heir, to, pushkin, more, introspective, but, no, less, subversive, was, his, the, thought, 1838, an, answer, to, kondraty, ryleyev, s, the, citizen, 1824, damning, the, lost, generation, of, servile, slaves, otherwise, lermontov, s, short, poems, range, from, indignantly, patriotic, pieces, like, fatherland, to, the, pantheistic, glorification, of, living, nature, e, g, alone, i, set, out, on, the, road, some, saw, lermontov, s, early, verse, as, puerile, since, despite, his, dexterous, command, of, the, language, it, usually, appeals, more, to, adolescents, than, to, adults, later, poems, like, the, poet, 1838, don, t, believe, yourself, 1839, and, so, dull, so, sad, 1840, expressed, skepticism, as, to, the, meaning, of, poetry, and, life, itself, on, the, other, hand, for, lermontov, the, late, 1830s, was, a, period, of, transition, drawn, more, to, russian, forests, and, fields, rather, than, caucasian, ranges, he, achieved, moments, of, transcendental, solemnity, and, clear, vision, of, heaven, and, earth, merged, into, one, in, poems, like, the, branch, of, palestine, the, prayer, and, when, yellowish, fields, get, ruffled, both, his, patriotic, and, pantheistic, poems, had, an, enormous, influence, on, later, russian, literature, boris, pasternak, for, instance, dedicated, his, 1917, poetic, collection, of, signal, importance, to, the, memory, of, lermontov, s, demon, this, long, poem, started, as, early, as, 1829, and, finished, some, ten, years, after, told, the, story, of, a, fallen, angel, admitting, defeat, in, the, moment, of, his, victory, over, tamara, a, georgian, maid, of, mountains, having, read, by, censors, as, the, celebration, of, carnal, passions, of, the, eternal, spirit, of, atheism, it, remained, banned, for, years, and, was, published, for, the, first, time, in, 1856, in, berlin, turning, arguably, the, most, popular, unpublished, russian, poem, of, the, mid, 19th, century, even, mirsky, who, ridiculed, demon, as, the, least, convincing, satan, in, the, history, of, the, world, poetry, called, him, an, operatic, character, and, fitting, perfectly, into, the, concept, of, anton, rubinstein, s, lush, opera, also, banned, by, censors, who, deemed, it, sacrilegious, had, to, admit, the, poem, had, magic, enough, to, inspire, mikhail, vrubel, for, his, series, of, unforgettable, images, another, 1839, poem, investigating, the, deeper, reasons, for, the, author, s, metaphysical, discontent, with, society, and, himself, was, the, novice, or, mtsyri, in, georgian, the, harrowing, story, of, a, dying, young, monk, who, d,

imprisons, it, both, poems, are, beautifully, stylized, and, written, in, fine, mellifluous, verse, which, belinsky, found, intoxicating, by, the, late, 1830s, lermontov, became, so, disgusted, with, his, own, early, infatuation, with, romanticism, as, to, ridicule, it, in, tambov, treasurer, s, wife, 1838, a, close, relative, to, pushkin, s, count, nulin, performed, in, stomping, yevgeny, onegin,

valerik, defined, by, mirsky, as, a, missing, link, between, the, copper, rider, and, the, war, and, peace, battle, scenes, that, are, seen, by, critics, as, the, two, peaks, of, lermontov, s, realism, this, newly, found, clarity, of, vision, allowed, him, to, handle, a, romantic, theme, with, pushkin, s, laconic, precision, most, impressively, in, the, fugitive, tellingly, while, pushkin, whose, poem, tazit, s, plotline, was, here, used, saw, the, european, influence, as, a, healthy, alternative, to, the, patriarchal, ways, of, caucasian, natives, lermontov, tended, to, idealize, the, local, communities, centuries, proven, customs, their, morality, codex, and, the, will, to, fight, for, freedom, and, independence, to, the, bitter, end, lermontov, had, a, peculiar, method, of, circulating, ideas, images, and, even, passages, trying, them, again, and, again, through, the, years, in, different, settings, until, each, would, find, itself, a, proper, place, as, if, he, could, see, in, his, imagination, his, future, works, but, was, receiving, them, in, small, fragments, even, in, memory, of, a, i, odoyevsky, 1839, the, central, episode, is, in, effect, the, slightly, re,

grushnitsky, who, move, side, by, side, towards, a, tragic, finale, as, if, driven, by, destiny, itself, proved, to, be, lermontov, s, magnum, opus, vissarion, belinsky, praised, it, as, a, masterpiece, but, vladimir, nabokov, who, translated, the, novel, into, english, was, not, so, sure, about, the, language, the, english, reader, should, be, aware, that, lermontov, s, prose, style, in, russian, is, inelegant, it, is, dry, and, drab, it, is, the, tool, of, an, energetic, incredibly, gifted, bitterly, honest, but, definitely, inexperienced, young, man, his, russian, is, at, times, almost, as, crude, as, stendhal, s, in, french, his, similes, and, metaphors, are, utterly, commonplace, his, hackneyed, epithets, are, only, redeemed, by, occasionally, being, incorrectly, used, repetition, of, words, in, descriptive, sentences, irritates, the, purist, he, wrote, d, s, mirsky, thought, differently, the, perfection, of, lermontov, s, style, and, narrative, manner, can, be, appreciated, only, by, those, who, really, know, russian, who, feel, fine, imponderable, shades, of, words, and, know, what, has, been, left, out, as, well, as, what, has, been, put, in, lermontov, s, prose, is, the, best, russian, prose, ever, written, if, we, judge, by, the, standards, of, perfection, and, not, by, those, of, wealth, it, is, transparent, for, it, is, absolutely, adequate, to, the, context, and, neither, overlaps, it, nor, is, overlapped, by, it, he, maintained, in, russia, a, hero, of, our, time, seems, to, have, never, lost, its, relevance, the, title, itself, became, a, token, phrase, explaining, dilemmas, haunting, this, country, s, intelligentsia, and, lermontov, s, reputation, as, an, heir, to, pushkin, there, is, seldom, doubted, his, foreign, biographers, though, tend, to, see, a, more, complicated, and, controversial, picture, according, to, lewis, bagby, he, led, such, a, wild, romantic, life, fulfilled, so, many, of, the, byronic, features, individualism, isolation, from, high, society, social, critic, and, misfit, and, lived, and, died, so, furiously, that, it, is, difficult, not, to, confuse, these, manifestations, of, identity, with, his, authentic, self, who, lermontov, had, become, or, who, he, was, becoming, is, unclear, lermontov, like, many, a, romantic, hero, once, closely, examined, remains, as, open, and, unfinished, as,
