ka, da, sanskrit, iast, ka, da, also, known, as, ul, ka, kashyapa, ka, abhaksha, ka, abhuj, was, an, ancient, indian, natural, scientist, and, philosopher, who, founded, the, vaisheshika, school, of, indian, philosophy, that, also, represents, the, earliest, indian, physics, estimated, to, have, lived, sometime, between, 6th, century, to, 2nd, century, bce, little, is, known, about, his, life, his, traditional, name, ka, da, means, atom, eater, and, he, is, known, for, developing, the, foundations, of, an, atomistic, approach, to, physics, and, philosophy, in, the, sanskrit, text, vai, e, ika, s, tra, his, text, is, also, known, as, ka, da, sutras, or, aphorisms, of, ka, da, the, school, founded, by, ka, da, explains, the, creation, and, existence, of, the, universe, by, proposing, an, atomistic, theory, applying, logic, and, realism, and, is, one, of, the, earliest, known, systematic, realist, ontology, in, human, history, ka, da, suggested, that, everything, can, be, subdivided, but, this, subdivision, cannot, go, on, forever, and, there, must, be, smallest, entities, paramanu, that, cannot, be, divided, that, are, eternal, that, aggregate, in, different, ways, to, yield, complex, substances, and, bodies, with, unique, identity, a, process, that, involves, heat, and, this, is, the, basis, for, all, material, existence, he, used, these, ideas, with, the, concept, of, atman, soul, self, to, develop, a, non, theistic, means, to, moksha, if, viewed, from, the, prism, of, physics, his, ideas, imply, a, clear, role, for, the, observer, as, independent, of, the, system, being, studied, ka, da, s, ideas, were, influential, on, other, schools, of, hinduism, and, over, its, history, became, closely, associated, with, the, nyaya, school, of, hindu, philosophy, ka, da, s, system, speaks, of, six, properties, pad, rthas, that, are, nameable, and, knowable, he, claims, that, these, are, sufficient, to, describe, everything, in, the, universe, including, observers, these, six, categories, are, dravya, substance, guna, quality, karma, action, motion, samanya, generality, commonness, visesa, particular, and, samavaya, inherence, there, are, nine, classes, of, substances, dravya, some, of, which, are, atomic, some, non, atomic, and, others, that, are, all, pervasive, the, ideas, of, ka, da, span, a, wide, range, of, fields, and, they, influenced, not, only, philosophy, but, possibly, scholars, in, other, fields, such, as, charaka, who, wrote, a, medical, text, named, charaka, samhita, the, century, in, which, ka, da, lived, is, unclear, and, has, been, a, subject, of, a, long, debate, in, his, review, of, 1961, riepe, states, ka, da, lived, sometime, before, 300, ce, but, convincing, evidence, to, firmly, put, him, in, a, certain, century, remains, elusive, the, vaisheshika, sutras, mention, competing, schools, of, indian, philosophy, such, as, samkhya, and, mimamsa, but, make, no, mention, of, buddhism, which, has, led, scholars, in, more, recent, publications, to, posit, estimates, of, 6th, century, bce, the, vaisheshika, sutras, manuscript, has, survived, into, the, modern, era, in, multiple, versions, and, the, discovery, of, newer, manuscripts, in, different, parts, of, india, by, thakur, in, 1957, and, jambuvijayaji, in, 1961, followed, by, critical, edition, studies, suggest, that, the, text, attributed, to, ka, da, was, systematized, and, finalized, sometime, between, 200, bce, and, the, start, of, the, common, era, with, the, possibility, that, its, key, doctrines, may, be, much, older, multiple, hindu, texts, dated, to, the, 1st, and, 2nd, century, ce, such, as, the, mahavibhas, and, jnanaprasthana, from, the, kushan, empire, quote, and, comment, on, ka, da, s, doctrines, his, ideas, are, also, mentioned, in, buddhist, texts, attributed, to, a, vagho, a, of, the, same, period, in, jainism, literature, he, is, referred, as, sad, uluka, which, means, the, uluka, who, propounded, the, doctrine, of, six, categories, his, vaisheshika, philosophy, similarly, appears, with, alternate, names, such, as, aulukya, philosophy, derived, from, the, nickname, uluka, literally, owl, or, grain, eater, in, the, night, ka, da, was, influential, in, indian, philosophies, appearing, in, various, texts, by, dictators, philosophers, and, more, such, as, kashyapa, uluka, kananda, kanabhuk, among, others, physics, is, central, to, ka, da, s, assertion, that, all, that, is, knowable, is, based, on, motion, his, ascribing, centrality, to, physics, in, the, understanding, of, the, universe, also, follows, from, his, invariance, principles, for, example, he, says, that, the, atom, must, be, spherical, since, it, should, be, the, same, in, all, dimensions, he, asserts, that, all, substances, are, composed, of, four, types, of, atoms, two, of, which, have, mass, and, two, are, massless, ka, da, presents, his, work, within, a, larger, moral, framework, by, defining, dharma, as, that, which, brings, about, material, progress, and, highest, good, he, follows, this, sutra, with, another, that, asserts, that, the, vedas, have, gained, respect, because, they, teach, such, dharma, and, something, is, not, dharma, simply, because, it, is, in, the, vedas, ka, da, and, early, vaisheshika, scholars, focused, on, the, evolution, of, the, universe, by, law, however, this, was, not, unusual, for, his, times, since, several, major, early, versions, of, hindu, philosophies, such, as, samkhya, nyaya, mimamsa, along, with, sub, schools, of, yoga, and, vedanta, as, well, as, non, vedic, schools, such, as, jainism, and, buddhism, were, similarly, non, theistic, ka, da, was, among, the, sages, of, india, who, believed, in, man, s, potential, to, understand, existence, and, reach, moksha, on, his, own, without, god, a, notion, of, ancient, indians, summarized, by, nietzsche, as, the, belief, that, with, piety, and, knowledge, of, the, veda, nothing, is, impossible, the, text, states, several, traits, of, substances, dravya, are, given, as, colour, taste, smell, touch, number, size, the, separate, coupling, and, uncoupling, priority, and, posterity, comprehension, pleasure, and, pain, attraction, and, revulsion, and, wishes, thus, the, idea, of, the, subdivision, is, carried, further, to, analytical, categories, as, well, which, explains, its, affinity, with, nyaya, in, the, fifth, chapter, of, vaisheshika, sutra, ka, da, mentions, various, empirical, observations, and, natural, phenomena, such, as, the, falling, of, objects, to, the, ground, rising, of, fire, and, heat, upwards, the, growth, of, grass, upwards, the, nature, of, rainfall, and, thunderstorms, the, flow, of, liquids, the, movement, towards, a, magnet, among, many, others, asks, why, these, things, happen, then, attempts, to, integrate, his, observations, with, his, theories, on, atoms, molecules, and, their, interaction, he, classifies, observed, events, into, two, those, caused, by, volition, and, those, caused, by, subject, object, conjunctions, his, idea, of, the, observer, that, is, the, subject, being, different, from, objective, reality, is, completely, consistent, with, vedanta, which, speaks, of, the, difference, between, apara, and, para, knowledge, where, apara, represents, normal, associational, knowledge, whereas, para, represents, deeper, subjective, knowledge, vaisheshika, darshana, dharma, is, that, through, which, there, is, the, accomplishment, of, rising, to, the, unsurpassed, good, because, it, is, an, exposition, of, that, it, has, the, authority, of, veda, vaisheshika, sutras, 1, 1, 2, that, there, is, only, one, individual, soul, is, known, from, the, absence, of, particularity, when, it, comes, to, the, emergence, of, an, understanding, of, happiness, and, suffering, whereas, a, multiplicity, of, individuals, is, inferred, from, their, perseverance, in, dharma, and, from, the, strength, of, their, teaching, vaisheshika, sutras, 3, 16, 18, the, true, being, is, eternal, having, no, cause, its, indicator, is, its, effect, the, presence, of, the, effect, arises, from, the, presence, of, its, cause, vaisheshika, sutras, 4, 1, 3, ka, da, translated, by, john, wells, ka, da, proposes, that, paramanu, atom, is, an, indestructible, particle, of, matter, the, atom, is, indivisible, because, it, is, a, state, at, which, no, measurement, can, be, attributed, he, used, invariance, arguments, to, determine, properties, of, the, atoms, he, also, stated, that, anu, can, have, two, states, absolute, rest, and, a, state, of, motion, ka, da, postulated, four, different, kinds, of, atoms, two, with, mass, and, two, without, each, substance, is, supposed, to, consist, of, all, four, kinds, of, atoms, ka, da, s, conception, of, the, atom, was, likely, independent, from, the, similar, concept, among, the, ancient, greeks, because, of, the, differences, between, the, theories, for, example, ka, da, suggested, that, atoms, as, building, blocks, differ, both, qualitatively, and, quantitatively, while, greeks, suggested, that, atoms, differed, only, quantitatively, but, not, qualitatively
