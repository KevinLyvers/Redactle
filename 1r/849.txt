false, cultural, representations, in, western, eastern, relations, the, thesis, of, orientalism, proposes, the, existence, of, a, subtle, and, persistent, eurocentric, prejudice, against, arabo, islamic, peoples, and, their, culture, which, originates, from, western, culture, s, long, tradition, of, false, romanticized, images, of, asia, in, general, and, the, middle, east, in, particular, said, wrote, that, such, cultural, representations, have, served, as, implicit, justifications, for, the, colonial, and, imperial, ambitions, of, the, european, powers, and, of, the, u, s, likewise, said, denounced, the, political, and, the, cultural, malpractices, of, the, r, gimes, of, the, ruling, arab, lites, who, he, felt, internalized, the, false, and, romanticized, representations, of, arabic, culture, that, were, created, by, anglo, american, orientalists, orientalism, proposed, that, much, western, study, of, islamic, civilization, was, political, intellectualism, meant, for, the, self, affirmation, of, european, identity, rather, than, objective, academic, study, thus, the, academic, field, of, oriental, studies, functioned, as, a, practical, method, of, cultural, discrimination, and, imperialist, domination, that, is, to, say, the, western, orientalist, knows, more, about, the, orient, than, do, the, orientals, 12, western, art, orientalism, continues, has, misrepresented, the, orient, with, stereotypes, since, antiquity, as, in, the, tragedy, the, persians, 472, bce, by, aeschylus, where, the, greek, protagonist, falls, because, he, misperceived, the, true, nature, of, the, orient, 56, 57, the, european, political, domination, of, asia, has, biased, even, the, most, outwardly, objective, western, texts, about, the, orient, to, a, degree, unrecognized, by, the, western, scholars, who, appropriated, for, themselves, the, production, of, cultural, knowledge, the, academic, work, of, studying, exploring, and, interpreting, the, languages, histories, and, peoples, of, asia, therefore, orientalist, scholarship, implies, that, the, colonial, subaltern, the, colonised, people, were, incapable, of, thinking, acting, or, speaking, for, themselves, thus, are, incapable, of, writing, their, own, national, histories, in, such, imperial, circumstances, the, orientalist, scholars, of, the, west, wrote, the, history, of, the, orient, and, so, constructed, the, modern, cultural, identities, of, asia, from, the, perspective, that, the, west, is, the, cultural, standard, to, emulate, the, norm, from, which, the, exotic, and, inscrutable, orientals, deviate, 38, 41, orientalism, provoked, much, professional, and, personal, criticism, for, said, among, academics, traditional, orientalists, such, as, albert, hourani, robert, graham, irwin, nikki, keddie, bernard, lewis, and, kanan, makiya, suffered, negative, consequences, because, orientalism, affected, public, perception, of, their, intellectual, integrity, and, the, quality, of, their, orientalist, scholarship, the, historian, keddie, said, that, said, s, critical, work, about, the, field, of, orientalism, had, caused, in, their, academic, disciplines, some, unfortunate, consequences, i, think, that, there, has, been, a, tendency, in, the, middle, east, field, to, adopt, the, word, orientalism, as, a, generalized, swear, word, essentially, referring, to, people, who, take, the, wrong, position, on, the, arab, israeli, dispute, or, to, people, who, are, judged, too, conservative, it, has, nothing, to, do, with, whether, they, are, good, or, not, good, in, their, disciplines, so, orientalism, for, many, people, is, a, word, that, substitutes, for, thought, and, enables, people, to, dismiss, certain, scholars, and, their, works, i, think, that, is, too, bad, it, may, not, have, been, what, edward, sa, d, meant, at, all, but, the, term, has, become, a, kind, of, slogan, in, orientalism, said, described, bernard, lewis, the, anglo, american, orientalist, as, a, perfect, exemplification, establishment, orientalist, purports, to, be, objective, liberal, scholarship, but, is, in, reality, very, close, to, being, propaganda, against, his, subject, material, 315, lewis, responded, with, a, harsh, critique, of, orientalism, accusing, said, of, politicizing, the, scientific, study, of, the, middle, east, and, arabic, studies, in, particular, neglecting, to, critique, the, scholarly, findings, of, the, orientalists, and, giving, free, rein, to, his, biases, said, retorted, that, in, the, muslim, discovery, of, europe, 1982, lewis, responded, to, his, thesis, with, the, claim, that, the, western, quest, for, knowledge, about, other, societies, was, unique, in, its, display, of, disinterested, curiosity, which, muslims, did, not, reciprocate, towards, europe, lewis, was, saying, that, knowledge, about, europe, the, only, acceptable, criterion, for, true, knowledge, the, appearance, of, academic, impartiality, was, part, of, lewis, s, role, as, an, academic, authority, for, zealous, anti, islamic, anti, arab, zionist, and, cold, war, crusades, 315, moreover, in, the, afterword, to, the, 1995, edition, of, the, book, said, replied, to, lewis, s, criticisms, of, the, first, edition, of, orientalism, 1978, 329, 54, in, the, academy, orientalism, became, a, foundational, text, of, the, field, of, post, colonial, studies, for, what, the, british, intellectual, terry, eagleton, said, is, the, book, s, central, truth, that, demeaning, images, of, the, east, and, imperialist, incursions, into, its, terrain, have, historically, gone, hand, in, hand, both, said, s, supporters, and, his, critics, acknowledge, the, transformative, influence, of, orientalism, upon, scholarship, in, the, humanities, critics, say, that, the, thesis, is, an, intellectually, limiting, influence, upon, scholars, whilst, supporters, say, that, the, thesis, is, intellectually, liberating, the, fields, of, post, colonial, and, cultural, studies, attempt, to, explain, the, post, colonial, world, its, peoples, and, their, discontents, for, which, the, techniques, of, investigation, and, efficacy, in, orientalism, proved, especially, applicable, in, middle, eastern, studies, as, such, the, investigation, and, analysis, said, applied, in, orientalism, proved, especially, practical, in, literary, criticism, and, cultural, studies, such, as, the, post, colonial, histories, of, india, by, gyan, prakash, nicholas, dirks, and, ronald, inden, modern, cambodia, by, simon, springer, and, the, literary, theories, of, homi, k, bhabha, gayatri, chakravorty, spivak, and, hamid, dabashi, iran, a, people, interrupted, 2007, in, eastern, europe, milica, baki, hayden, developed, the, concept, of, nesting, orientalisms, 1992, derived, from, the, ideas, of, the, historian, larry, wolff, inventing, eastern, europe, the, map, of, civilization, on, the, mind, of, the, enlightenment, 1994, and, said, s, ideas, in, orientalism, 1978, the, bulgarian, historian, maria, todorova, imagining, the, balkans, 1997, presented, the, ethnologic, concept, of, nesting, balkanisms, ethnologia, balkanica, 1997, which, is, derived, from, milica, baki, hayden, s, concept, of, nesting, orientalisms, in, the, impact, of, biblical, orientalism, in, late, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, century, palestine, 2014, the, historian, lorenzo, kamel, presented, the, concept, of, biblical, orientalism, with, an, historical, analysis, of, the, simplifications, of, the, complex, local, palestinian, reality, which, occurred, from, the, 1830s, until, the, early, 20th, century, kamel, said, that, the, selective, usage, and, simplification, of, religion, in, approaching, the, place, known, as, the, holy, land, created, a, view, that, as, a, place, the, holy, land, has, no, human, history, other, than, as, the, place, where, bible, stories, occurred, rather, than, as, palestine, a, country, inhabited, by, many, peoples, the, post, colonial, discourse, presented, in, orientalism, also, influenced, post, colonial, theology, and, post, colonial, biblical, criticism, by, which, method, the, analytical, reader, approaches, a, scripture, from, the, perspective, of, a, colonial, reader, another, book, in, this, area, is, postcolonial, theory, 1998, by, leela, gandhi, explains, post, colonialism, in, terms, of, how, it, can, be, applied, to, the, wider, philosophical, and, intellectual, context, of, history, in, 1967, consequent, to, the, six, day, war, said, became, a, public, intellectual, when, he, acted, politically, to, counter, the, stereotyped, misrepresentations, factual, historical, cultural, with, which, american, news, media, explained, the, arab, israeli, conflict, reportage, divorced, from, the, historical, realities, of, the, middle, east, in, general, and, from, israel, and, the, palestinian, territories, in, particular, to, address, explain, and, correct, such, perceived, orientalism, said, published, the, arab, portrayed, 1968, a, descriptive, essay, about, images, of, the, arab, that, are, meant, to, evade, specific, discussion, of, the, historical, and, cultural, realities, of, the, peoples, represented, in, the, middle, east, featured, in, journalism, print, photograph, television, and, some, types, of, scholarship, specialist, journals, in, the, essay, zionism, from, the, standpoint, of, its, victims, 1979, said, argued, in, favour, of, the, political, legitimacy, and, philosophical, authenticity, of, the, claims, and, right, to, a, jewish, homeland, while, also, asserting, the, simultaneously, inherent, right, of, national, self, determination, for, the, palestinian, people, he, also, characterized, israel, s, founding, as, it, happened, the, displacement, of, the, palestinian, arabs, that, accompanied, it, and, the, subjugation, of, the, palestinians, in, the, israeli, occupied, territories, as, a, manifestation, of, western, style, imperialism, his, books, on, this, topic, include, the, question, of, palestine, 1979, the, politics, of, dispossession, 1994, and, the, end, of, the, peace, process, 2000, during, a, lecture, conference, at, the, university, of, washington, in, 2003, said, affirmed, that, israeli, jews, had, grounds, for, a, territorial, claim, to, palestine, or, the, land, of, israel, but, maintained, that, it, was, not, the, only, claim, or, the, main, claim, vis, vis, all, of, the, other, ethnic, groups, including, jews, and, arabs, who, have, inhabited, the, region, throughout, human, history, halleran, professor, said, do, the, zionists, have, any, historical, claim, to, the, lands, of, israel, said, of, course, but, i, would, not, say, that, the, jewish, claim, or, the, zionist, claim, is, the, only, claim, or, the, main, claim, i, say, that, it, is, a, claim, among, many, others, certainly, the, arabs, have, a, much, greater, claim, because, they, have, had, a, longer, history, of, inhabitance, of, actual, residence, in, palestine, than, the, jews, did, if, you, look, at, the, history, of, palestine, there, s, been, some, quite, interesting, work, done, by, biblical, archaeologists, you, ll, see, that, the, period, of, actual, israelite, as, it, was, called, in, the, old, testament, dominance, in, palestine, amounts, to, about, 200, to, 250, years, but, there, were, moabites, there, were, jebusites, there, were, canaanites, there, were, philistines, there, were, many, other, people, in, palestine, at, the, time, and, before, and, after, and, to, isolate, one, of, them, and, say, that, s, the, real, owner, of, the, land, i, mean, that, is, that, is, fundamentalism, because, the, only, way, you, can, back, it, up, is, say, well, god, gave, it, to, us, so, i, think, the, people, who, have, a, history, of, residence, in, palestine, for, a, certain, amount, of, time, including, jews, yes, and, of, course, the, arabs, have, a, claim, but, this, is, very, important, i, don, t, think, any, claim, nobody, has, a, claim, that, overrides, all, the, others, and, entitles, that, person, with, that, so, called, claim, to, drive, people, out, said, s, argument, against, the, religious, zionism, traditionally, espoused, by, jewish, fundamentalists, i, e, citing, god, to, project, the, jewish, israeli, claim, as, superior, to, the, arab, palestinian, claim, asserted, that, such, justifications, were, inherently, irrational, because, they, would, among, other, factors, enable, christians, and, muslims, of, all, ethnic, and, cultural, backgrounds, to, lay, superseding, territorial, claims, to, palestine, on, the, basis, of, their, faith, from, 1977, until, 1991, said, was, an, independent, member, of, the, palestinian, national, council, pnc, in, 1988, he, was, a, proponent, of, the, two, state, solution, to, the, israeli, palestinian, conflict, and, voted, for, the, establishment, of, the, state, of, palestine, at, a, meeting, of, the, pnc, in, algiers, in, 1993, said, quit, his, membership, in, the, palestinian, national, council, to, protest, the, internal, politics, that, led, to, the, signing, of, the, oslo, accords, declaration, of, principles, on, interim, self, government, arrangements, 1993, which, he, thought, had, unacceptable, terms, and, because, the, terms, had, been, rejected, by, the, madrid, conference, of, 1991, said, disliked, the, oslo, accords, for, not, producing, an, independent, state, of, palestine, and, because, they, were, politically, inferior, to, a, plan, that, yasir, arafat, had, rejected, a, plan, said, had, presented, to, arafat, on, behalf, of, the, u, s, government, in, the, late, 1970s, especially, troublesome, to, said, was, his, belief, that, yasir, arafat, had, betrayed, the, right, of, return, of, the, palestinian, refugees, to, their, houses, and, properties, in, the, green, line, territories, of, pre, 1967, israel, and, that, arafat, ignored, the, growing, political, threat, of, the, israeli, settlements, in, the, occupied, territories, that, had, been, established, since, the, conquest, of, palestine, in, 1967, in, 1995, in, response, to, said, s, political, criticisms, the, palestinian, authority, pa, banned, the, sale, of, said, s, books, however, the, pa, lifted, the, book, ban, when, said, publicly, praised, yasir, arafat, for, rejecting, prime, minister, ehud, barak, s, offers,

three, thousand, years, 1994, by, israel, shahak, about, jewish, fundamentalism, which, presents, the, cultural, proposition, that, israel, s, mistreatment, of, the, palestinians, is, rooted, in, a, judaic, requirement, of, permission, for, jews, to, commit, crimes, including, murder, against, gentiles, non, jews, in, his, foreword, said, said, that, jewish, history, jewish, religion, is, nothing, less, than, a, concise, history, of, classic, and, modern, judaism, insofar, as, these, are, relevant, to, the, understanding, of, modern, israel, and, praised, the, historian, shahak, for, describing, contemporary, israel, as, a, nation, subsumed, in, a, judeo, nazi, cultural, ambiance, that, allowed, the, dehumanization, of, the, palestinian, other, in, all, my, works, i, remained, fundamentally, critical, of, a, gloating, and, uncritical, nationalism, my, view, of, palestine, remains, the, same, today, i, expressed, all, sorts, of, reservations, about, the, insouciant, nativism, and, militant, militarism, of, the, nationalist, consensus, i, suggested, instead, a, critical, look, at, the, arab, environment, palestinian, history, and, the, israeli, realities, with, the, explicit, conclusion, that, only, a, negotiated, settlement, between, the, two, communities, of, suffering, arab, and, jewish, would, provide, respite, from, the, unending, war, in, 1998, said,
