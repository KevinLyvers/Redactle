ireland, and, sister, of, kings, charles, ii, and, james, ii, and, vii, eight, days, before, william, was, born, his, father, died, of, smallpox, thus, william, was, the, sovereign, prince, of, orange, from, the, moment, of, his, birth, immediately, a, conflict, arose, between, his, mother, and, his, paternal, grandmother, amalia, of, solms, braunfels, over, the, name, to, be, given, to, the, infant, mary, wanted, to, name, him, charles, after, her, brother, but, her, mother, in, law, insisted, on, giving, him, the, name, william, willem, to, bolster, his, prospects, of, becoming, stadtholder, william, ii, had, intended, to, appoint, his, wife, as, their, son, s, guardian, in, his, will, however, the, document, remained, unsigned, at, william, ii, s, death, and, was, therefore, void, on, 13, august, 1651, the, hoge, raad, van, holland, en, zeeland, supreme, court, ruled, that, guardianship, would, be, shared, between, his, mother, his, grandmother, and, frederick, william, elector, of, brandenburg, husband, of, his, paternal, aunt, louise, henriette, william, s, mother, showed, little, personal, interest, in, her, son, sometimes, being, absent, for, years, and, had, always, deliberately, kept, herself, apart, from, dutch, society, william, s, education, was, first, laid, in, the, hands, of, several, dutch, governesses, some, of, english, descent, including, walburg, howard, and, the, scottish, noblewoman, lady, anna, mackenzie, from, april, 1656, the, prince, received, daily, instruction, in, the, reformed, religion, from, the, calvinist, preacher, cornelis, trigland, a, follower, of, the, contra, remonstrant, theologian, gisbertus, voetius, the, ideal, education, for, william, was, described, in, discours, sur, la, nourriture, de, s, h, monseigneur, le, prince, d, orange, a, short, treatise, perhaps, by, one, of, william, s, tutors, constantijn, huygens, in, these, lessons, the, prince, was, taught, that, he, was, predestined, to, become, an, instrument, of, divine, providence, fulfilling, the, historical, destiny, of, the, house, of, orange, nassau, william, was, seen, despite, his, youth, as, the, leader, of, the, orangist, party, heir, to, the, stadholderships, of, several, provinces, and, the, office, of, captain, general, of, the, union, see, politics, and, government, of, the, dutch, republic, he, was, viewed, as, the, leader, of, the, nation, in, its, independence, movement, and, its, protector, from, foreign, threats, this, was, in, the, tradition, of, the, princes, of, orange, before, him, his, great, grandfather, william, the, silent, his, grand, uncle, maurice, his, grandfather, frederick, henry, and, his, father, william, ii, from, early, 1659, william, spent, seven, years, at, the, university, of, leiden, for, a, formal, education, under, the, guidance, of, ethics, professor, hendrik, bornius, though, never, officially, enrolling, as, a, student, while, residing, in, the, prinsenhof, at, delft, william, had, a, small, personal, retinue, including, hans, willem, bentinck, and, a, new, governor, frederick, nassau, de, zuylenstein, who, as, an, illegitimate, son, of, stadtholder, frederick, henry, of, orange, was, his, paternal, uncle, grand, pensionary, johan, de, witt, and, his, uncle, cornelis, de, graeff, pushed, the, states, of, holland, to, take, charge, of, william, s, education, and, ensure, that, he, would, acquire, the, skills, to, serve, in, a, future, though, undetermined, state, function, the, states, acted, on, 25, september, 1660, around, this, time, the, young, prince, played, with, de, graeff, s, sons, pieter, and, jacob, de, graeff, in, the, park, of, the, country, house, in, soestdijk, in, 1674, wilhelm, bought, the, estate, from, jacob, de, graeff, which, was, later, converted, into, soestdijk, palace, this, first, involvement, of, the, authorities, did, not, last, long, on, 23, december, 1660, when, william, was, ten, years, old, his, mother, died, of, smallpox, at, whitehall, palace, london, while, visiting, her, brother, the, recently, restored, king, charles, ii, in, her, will, mary, requested, that, charles, look, after, william, s, interests, and, charles, now, demanded, that, the, states, of, holland, end, their, interference, to, appease, charles, they, complied, on, 30, september, 1661, that, year, zuylenstein, began, to, work, for, charles, and, induced, william, to, write, letters, to, his, uncle, asking, him, to, help, william, become, stadtholder, someday, after, his, mother, s, death, william, s, education, and, guardianship, became, a, point, of, contention, between, his, dynasty, s, supporters, and, the, advocates, of, a, more, republican, netherlands, the, dutch, authorities, did, their, best, at, first, to, ignore, these, intrigues, but, in, the, second, anglo, dutch, war, one, of, charles, s, peace, conditions, was, the, improvement, of, the, position, of, his, nephew, as, a, countermeasure, in, 1666, when, william, was, sixteen, the, states, officially, made, him, a, ward, of, the, government, or, a, child, of, state, all, pro, english, courtiers, including, zuylenstein, were, removed, from, william, s, company, william, begged, de, witt, to, allow, zuylenstein, to, stay, but, he, refused, de, witt, the, leading, politician, of, the, republic, took, william, s, education, into, his, own, hands, instructing, him, weekly, in, state, matters, and, joining, him, for, regular, games, of, real, tennis, after, the, death, of, william, s, father, most, provinces, had, left, the, office, of, stadtholder, vacant, at, the, demand, of, oliver, cromwell, the, treaty, of, westminster, which, ended, the, first, anglo, dutch, war, had, a, secret, annexe, that, required, the, act, of, seclusion, which, forbade, the, province, of, holland, from, appointing, a, member, of, the, house, of, orange, as, stadtholder, after, the, english, restoration, the, act, of, seclusion, which, had, not, remained, a, secret, for, long, was, declared, void, as, the, english, commonwealth, with, which, the, treaty, had, been, concluded, no, longer, existed, in, 1660, william, s, mother, mary, and, grandmother, amalia, tried, to, persuade, several, provincial, states, to, designate, william, as, their, future, stadtholder, but, they, all, initially, refused, in, 1667, as, william, iii, approached, the, age, of, 18, the, orangist, party, again, attempted, to, bring, him, to, power, by, securing, for, him, the, offices, of, stadtholder, and, captain, general, to, prevent, the, restoration, of, the, influence, of, the, house, of, orange, de, witt, the, leader, of, the, states, party, allowed, the, pensionary, of, haarlem, gaspar, fagel, to, induce, the, states, of, holland, to, issue, the, perpetual, edict, the, edict, supported, by, the, important, amsterdam, politicians, andries, de, graeff, and, gillis, valckenier, declared, that, the, captain, general, or, admiral, general, of, the, netherlands, could, not, serve, as, stadtholder, in, any, province, even, so, william, s, supporters, sought, ways, to, enhance, his, prestige, and, on, 19, september, 1668, the, states, of, zeeland, appointed, him, as, first, noble, to, receive, this, honour, william, had, to, escape, the, attention, of, his, state, tutors, and, travel, secretly, to, middelburg, a, month, later, amalia, allowed, william, to, manage, his, own, household, and, declared, him, to, be, of, majority, age, the, province, of, holland, the, centre, of, anti, orangism, abolished, the, office, of, stadtholder, and, four, other, provinces, followed, suit, in, march, 1670, establishing, the, so, called, harmony, de, witt, demanded, an, oath, from, each, holland, regent, city, council, member, to, uphold, the, edict, all, but, one, complied, william, saw, all, this, as, a, defeat, but, the, arrangement, was, a, compromise, de, witt, would, have, preferred, to, ignore, the, prince, completely, but, now, his, eventual, rise, to, the, office, of, supreme, army, commander, was, implicit, de, witt, further, conceded, that, william, would, be, admitted, as, a, member, of, the, raad, van, state, the, council, of, state, then, the, generality, organ, administering, the, defence, budget, william, was, introduced, to, the, council, on, 31, may, 1670, with, full, voting, rights, despite, de, witt, s, attempts, to, limit, his, role, to, that, of, an, advisor, in, november, 1670, william, obtained, permission, to, travel, to, england, to, urge, charles, to, pay, back, at, least, a, part, of, the, 2, 797, 859, guilder, debt, the, house, of, stuart, owed, the, house, of, orange, charles, was, unable, to, pay, but, william, agreed, to, reduce, the, amount, owed, to, 1, 800, 000, guilders, charles, found, his, nephew, to, be, a, dedicated, calvinist, and, patriotic, dutchman, and, reconsidered, his, desire, to, show, him, the, secret, treaty, of, dover, with, france, directed, at, destroying, the, dutch, republic, and, installing, william, as, sovereign, of, a, dutch, rump, state, in, addition, to, differing, political, outlooks, william, found, that, his, lifestyle, differed, from, his, uncles, charles, and, james, who, were, more, concerned, with, drinking, gambling, and, cavorting, with, mistresses, the, following, year, the, republic, s, security, deteriorated, quickly, as, an, anglo, french, attack, became, imminent, in, view, of, the, threat, the, states, of, gelderland, wanted, william, to, be, appointed, captain, general, of, the, dutch, states, army, as, soon, as, possible, despite, his, youth, and, inexperience, on, 15, december, 1671, the, states, of, utrecht, made, this, their, official, policy, on, 19, january, 1672, the, states, of, holland, made, a, counterproposal, to, appoint, william, for, just, a, single, campaign, the, prince, refused, this, and, on, 25, february, a, compromise, was, reached, an, appointment, by, the, states, general, for, one, summer, followed, by, a, permanent, appointment, on, his, 22nd, birthday, meanwhile, william, had, written, a, secret, letter, to, charles, in, january, 1672, asking, his, uncle, to, exploit, the, situation, by, exerting, pressure, on, the, states, to, appoint, william, stadtholder, in, return, william, would, ally, the, republic, with, england, and, serve, charles, s, interests, as, much, as, his, honour, and, the, loyalty, due, to, this, state, allowed, charles, took, no, action, on, the, proposal, and, continued, his, war, plans, with, his, french, ally, for, the, dutch, republic, 1672, proved, calamitous, it, became, known, as, the, rampjaar, disaster, year, because, in, the, franco, dutch, war, and, the, third, anglo, dutch, war, the, netherlands, was, invaded, by, france, and, its, allies, england, m, nster, and, cologne, although, the, anglo, french, fleet, was, disabled, by, the, battle, of, solebay, in, june, the, french, army, quickly, overran, the, provinces, of, gelderland, and, utrecht, on, 14, june, william, withdrew, with, the, remnants, of, his, field, army, into, holland, where, the, states, had, ordered, the, flooding, of, the, dutch, waterline, on, 8, june, louis, xiv, of, france, believing, the, war, was, over, began, negotiations, to, extract, as, large, a, sum, of, money, from, the, dutch, as, possible, the, presence, of, a, large, french, army, in, the, heart, of, the, republic, caused, a, general, panic, and, the, people, turned, against, de, witt, and, his, allies, on, 4, july, the, states, of, holland, appointed, william, stadtholder, and, he, took, the, oath, five, days, later, the, next, day, a, special, envoy, from, charles, ii, lord, arlington, met, william, in, nieuwerbrug, and, presented, a, proposal, from, charles, in, return, for, william, s, capitulation, to, england, and, france, charles, would, make, william, sovereign, prince, of, holland, instead, of, stadtholder, a, mere, civil, servant, when, william, refused, arlington, threatened, that, william, would, witness, the, end, of, the, republic, s, existence, william, answered, famously, there, is, one, way, to, avoid, this, to, die, defending, it, in, the, last, ditch, on, 7, july, the, inundations, were, complete, and, the, further, advance, of, the, french, army, was, effectively, blocked, on, 16, july, zeeland, offered, the, stadtholdership, to, william, johan, de, witt, had, been, unable, to, function, as, grand, pensionary, after, being, wounded, by, an, attempt, on, his, life, on, 21, june, on, 15, august, william, published, a, letter, from, charles, in, which, the, english, king, stated, that, he, had, made, war, because, of, the, aggression, of, the, de, witt, faction, the, people, thus, incited, de, witt, and, his, brother, cornelis, were, brutally, murdered, by, an, orangist, civil, militia, in, the, hague, on, 20, august, subsequently, william, replaced, many, of, the, dutch, regents, with, his, followers, though, william, s, complicity, in, the, lynching, has, never, been, proved, and, some, 19th, century, dutch, historians, have, made, an, effort, to, disprove, that, he, was, an, accessory, he, thwarted, attempts, to, prosecute, the, ringleaders, and, even, rewarded, some, like, hendrik, verhoeff, with, money, and, others, like, johan, van, banchem, and, johan, kievit, with, high, offices, this, damaged, his, reputation, in, the, same, fashion, as, his, later, actions, at, glencoe, william, continued, to, fight, against, the, invaders, from, england, and, france, allying, himself, with, spain, brandenburg, and, emperor, leopold, i, in, november, 1672, he, took, his, army, to, maastricht, to, threaten, the, french, supply, lines, in, september, 1673, the, dutch, situation, further, improved, the, resolute, defence, by, john, maurice, of, nassau, siegen, and, hans, willem, van, aylva, in, the, north, of, the, dutch, republic, finally, forced, the, troops, of, m, nster, and, cologne, to, withdraw, while, william, crossed, the, dutch, waterline, and, recaptured, naarden, in, november, a, 30, 000, strong, dutch, spanish, army, under, william, s, command, marched, into, the, lands, of, the, bishops, of, m, nster, and, cologne, the, dutch, troops, took, revenge, and, carried, out, many, atrocities, together, with, 35, 000, imperial, troops, they, then, captured, bonn, an, important, magazine, in, the, long, logistical, lines, between, france, and, the, dutch, republic, the, french, position, in, the, netherlands, became, untenable, and, louis, was, forced, to, evacuate, french, troops, this, deeply, shocked, louis, and, he, retreated, to, saint, germain, where, no, one, except, a, few, intimates, were, allowed, to, disturb, him, the, next, year, only, grave, and, maastricht, remained, in, french, hands, fagel, now, proposed, to, treat, the, liberated, provinces, of, utrecht, gelderland, and, overijssel, as, conquered, territory, generality, lands, as, punishment, for, their, quick, surrender, to, the, enemy, william, refused, but, obtained, a, special, mandate, from, the, states, general, to, appoint, all, delegates, in, the, states, of, these, provinces, anew, william, s, followers, in, the, states, of, utrecht, on, 26, april, 1674, appointed, him, hereditary, stadtholder, on, 30, january, 1675, the, states, of, gelderland, offered, him, the, titles, of, duke, of, guelders, and, count, of, zutphen, the, negative, reactions, to, this, from, zeeland, and, the, city, of, amsterdam, made, william, ultimately, decide, to, decline, these, honours, he, was, instead, appointed, stadtholder, of, gelderland, and, overijssel, baruch, spinoza, s, warning, in, his, political, treatise, of, 1677, of, the, need, to, organize, the, state, so, that, the, citizens, maintain, control, over, the, sovereign, was, an, influential, expression, of, this, unease, with, the, concentration, of, power, in, one, person, meanwhile, the, front, of, the, war, against, france, had, shifted, to, the, spanish, netherlands, in, 1674, allied, forces, in, the, netherlands, were, numerically, superior, to, the, french, army, under, cond, which, was, based, along, the, pi, ton, river, near, charleroi, william, took, the, offensive, and, sought, to, bring, on, a, battle, by, outflanking, the, french, positions, but, the, broken, ground, forced, him, to, divide, his, army, into, three, separate, columns, at, seneffe, cond, led, a, cavalry, attack, against, the, allied, vanguard, and, by, midday, on, 11, august, had, halted, their, advance, against, the, advice, of, his, subordinates, he, then, ordered, a, series, of, frontal, assaults, which, led, to, very, heavy, casualties, on, both, sides, with, no, concrete, result, william, and, the, dutch, blamed, the, imperial, commander, de, souches, and, after, a, failed, attempt, to, capture, oudenaarde, largely, due, to, obstructionism, from, de, souches, he, was, relieved, of, command, frustrated, william, joined, the, army, under, rabenhaupt, with, 10, 000, troops, instead, of, campaigning, further, in, the, spanish, netherlands, he, assumed, command, of, operations, at, grave, which, had, been, besieged, since, 28, june, grave, surrendered, on, 27, october, the, dutch, were, split, by, internal, disputes, the, powerful, amsterdam, mercantile, body, was, anxious, to, end, an, expensive, war, once, their, commercial, interests, were, secured, while, william, saw, france, as, a, long, term, threat, that, had, to, be, defeated, this, conflict, increased, once, ending, the, war, became, a, distinct, possibility, when, grave, was, captured, in, october, 1674, leaving, only, maastricht, on, both, sides, the, last, years, of, the, war, saw, minimal, return, for, their, investment, of, men, and, money, the, french, were, preparing, a, major, offensive, however, at, the, end, of, 1676, intended, to, capture, valenciennes, cambrai, and, saint, omer, in, the, spanish, netherlands, louis, believed, this, would, deprive, the, dutch, regents, of, the, courage, to, continue, the, war, any, longer, in, this, however, he, was, mistaken, the, impending, french, offensive, actually, led, to, an, intensification, of, dutch, spanish, cooperation, still, the, french, offensive, of, 1677, was, a, success, the, spaniards, found, it, difficult, to, raise, enough, troops, due, to, financial, constraints, and, the, allies, were, defeated, in, the, battle, of, cassel, this, meant, that, they, could, not, prevent, the, cities, from, falling, into, french, hands, the, french, then, took, a, defensive, posture, afraid, that, more, success, would, force, england, to, intervene, on, the, side, of, the, allies, the, peace, talks, that, began, at, nijmegen, in, 1676, were, given, a, greater, sense, of, urgency, in, november, 1677, when, william, married, his, cousin, mary, charles, ii, of, england, s, niece, an, anglo, dutch, defensive, alliance, followed, in, march, 1678, although, english, troops, did, not, arrive, in, significant, numbers, until, late, may, louis, seized, this, opportunity, to, improve, his, negotiating, position, and, captured, ypres, and, ghent, in, early, march, before, signing, a, peace, treaty, with, the, dutch, on, 10, august, the, battle, of, saint, denis, was, fought, three, days, later, on, 13, august, when, a, combined, dutch, spanish, force, under, william, attacked, the, french, army, under, luxembourg, luxembourg, withdrew, and, william, thus, ensured, mons, would, remain, in, spanish, hands, on, 19, august, spain, and, france, agreed, an, armistice, followed, by, a, formal, peace, treaty, on, 17, september, the, war, had, seen, the, rebirth, of, the, dutch, states, army, as, one, of, the, most, disciplined, and, best, trained, european, armed, forces, this, had, not, been, enough, to, keep, france, from, making, conquests, in, the, spanish, netherlands, which, william, and, the, regents, blamed, mainly, on, the, spaniards, the, dutch, expected, the, once, powerful, spanish, empire, to, have, more, military, strength, during, the, war, with, france, william, tried, to, improve, his, position, by, marrying, in, 1677, his, first, cousin, mary, elder, surviving, daughter, of, the, duke, of, york, later, king, james, ii, of, england, james, vii, of, scotland, mary, was, eleven, years, his, junior, and, he, anticipated, resistance, to, a, stuart, match, from, the, amsterdam, merchants, who, had, disliked, his, mother, another, mary, stuart, but, william, believed, that, marrying, mary, would, increase, his, chances, of, succeeding, to, charles, s, kingdoms, and, would, draw, england, s, monarch, away, from, his, pro, french, policies, james, was, not, inclined, to, consent, but, charles, ii, pressured, his, brother, to, agree, charles, wanted, to, use, the, possibility, of, marriage, to, gain, leverage, in, negotiations, relating, to, the, war, but, william, insisted, that, the, two, issues, be, decided, separately, charles, relented, and, bishop, henry, compton, married, the, couple, on, 4, november, 1677, mary, became, pregnant, soon, after, the, marriage, but, miscarried, after, a, further, illness, later, in, 1678, she, never, conceived, again, throughout, william, and, mary, s, marriage, william, had, only, one, reputed, mistress, elizabeth, villiers, in, contrast, to, the, many, mistresses, his, uncles, openly, kept, by, 1678, louis, xiv, sought, peace, with, the, dutch, republic, even, so, tensions, remained, william, remained, suspicious, of, louis, thinking, that, the, french, king, desired, universal, kingship, over, europe, louis, described, william, as, my, mortal, enemy, and, saw, him, as, an, obnoxious, warmonger, france, s, annexations, in, the, southern, netherlands, and, germany, the, r, union, policy, and, the, revocation, of, the, edict, of, nantes, in, 1685, caused, a, surge, of, huguenot, refugees, to, the, republic, this, led, william, iii, to, join, various, anti, french, alliances, such, as, the, association, league, and, ultimately, the, league, of, augsburg, an, anti, french, coalition, that, also, included, the, holy, roman, empire, sweden, spain, and, several, german, states, in, 1686, after, his, marriage, in, november, 1677, william, became, a, strong, candidate, for, the, english, throne, should, his, father, in, law, and, uncle, james, be, excluded, because, of, his, catholicism, during, the, crisis, concerning, the, exclusion, bill, in, 1680, charles, at, first, invited, william, to, come, to, england, to, bolster, the, king, s, position, against, the, exclusionists, then, withdrew, his, invitation, after, which, lord, sunderland, also, tried, unsuccessfully, to, bring, william, over, but, now, to, put, pressure, on, charles, nevertheless, william, secretly, induced, the, states, general, to, send, charles, the, insinuation, a, plea, beseeching, the, king, to, prevent, any, catholics, from, succeeding, him, without, explicitly, naming, james, after, receiving, indignant, reactions, from, charles, and, james, william, denied, any, involvement, in, 1685, when, james, ii, succeeded, charles, william, at, first, attempted, a, conciliatory, approach, at, the, same, time, trying, not, to, offend, the, protestants, in, england, william, ever, looking, for, ways, to, diminish, the, power, of, france, hoped, that, james, would, join, the, league, of, augsburg, but, by, 1687, it, became, clear, that, james, would, not, join, the, anti, french, alliance, relations, worsened, between, william, and, james, thereafter, in, november, james, s, second, wife, mary, of, modena, was, announced, to, be, pregnant, that, month, to, gain, the, favour, of, english, protestants, william, wrote, an, open, letter, to, the, english, people, in, which, he, disapproved, of, james, s, pro, roman, catholic, policy, of, religious, toleration, seeing, him, as, a, friend, and, often, having, maintained, secret, contacts, with, him, for, years, many, english, politicians, began, to, urge, an, armed, invasion, of, england, william, at, first, opposed, the, prospect, of, invasion, but, most, historians, now, agree, that, he, began, to, assemble, an, expeditionary, force, in, april, 1688, as, it, became, increasingly, clear, that, france, would, remain, occupied, by, campaigns, in, germany, and, italy, and, thus, unable, to, mount, an, attack, while, william, s, troops, would, be, occupied, in, britain, believing, that, the, english, people, would, not, react, well, to, a, foreign, invader, he, demanded, in, a, letter, to, rear, admiral, arthur, herbert, that, the, most, eminent, english, protestants, first, invite, him, to, invade, in, june, mary, of, modena, after, a, string, of, miscarriages, gave, birth, to, a, son, james, francis, edward, stuart, who, displaced, william, s, protestant, wife, to, become, first, in, the, line, of, succession, and, raised, the, prospect, of, an, ongoing, catholic, monarchy, public, anger, also, increased, because, of, the, trial, of, seven, bishops, who, had, publicly, opposed, james, s, declaration, of, indulgence, granting, religious, liberty, to, his, subjects, a, policy, which, appeared, to, threaten, the, establishment, of, the, anglican, church, on, 30, june, 1688, the, same, day, the, bishops, were, acquitted, a, group, of, political, figures, known, afterward, as, the, immortal, seven, sent, william, a, formal, invitation, william, s, intentions, to, invade, were, public, knowledge, by, september, 1688, with, a, dutch, army, william, landed, at, brixham, in, southwest, england, on, 5, november, 1688, he, came, ashore, from, the, ship, den, briel, proclaiming, the, liberties, of, england, and, the, protestant, religion, i, will, maintain, william, s, fleet, was, vastly, larger, than, the, spanish, armada, 100, years, earlier, approximately, consisting, of, 463, ships, with, 40, 000, men, on, board, including, 9, 500, sailors, 11, 000, foot, soldiers, 4, 000, cavalry, and, 5, 000, english, and, huguenot, volunteers, james, s, support, began, to, dissolve, almost, immediately, upon, william, s, arrival, protestant, officers, defected, from, the, english, army, the, most, notable, of, whom, was, lord, churchill, of, eyemouth, james, s, most, able, commander, and, influential, noblemen, across, the, country, declared, their, support, for, the, invader, james, at, first, attempted, to, resist, william, but, saw, that, his, efforts, would, prove, futile, he, sent, representatives, to, negotiate, with, william, but, secretly, attempted, to, flee, on, 11, december, throwing, the, great, seal, into, the, thames, on, his, way, he, was, discovered, and, brought, back, to, london, by, a, group, of, fishermen, he, was, allowed, to, leave, for, france, in, a, second, escape, attempt, on, 23, december, william, permitted, james, to, leave, the, country, not, wanting, to, make, him, a, martyr, for, the, roman, catholic, cause, it, was, in, his, interests, for, james, to, be, perceived, as, having, left, the, country, of, his, own, accord, rather, than, having, been, forced, or, frightened, into, fleeing, william, is, the, last, person, to, successfully, invade, england, by, force, of, arms, william, summoned, a, convention, parliament, in, england, which, met, on, 22, january, 1689, to, discuss, the, appropriate, course, of, action, following, james, s, flight, william, felt, insecure, about, his, position, though, his, wife, preceded, him, in, the, line, of, succession, to, the, throne, he, wished, to, reign, as, king, in, his, own, right, rather, than, as, a, mere, consort, the, only, precedent, for, a, joint, monarchy, in, england, dated, from, the, 16th, century, when, queen, mary, i, married, philip, of, spain, philip, remained, king, only, during, his, wife, s, lifetime, and, restrictions, were, placed, on, his, power, william, on, the, other, hand, demanded, that, he, remain, as, king, even, after, his, wife, s, death, when, the, majority, of, tory, lords, proposed, to, acclaim, her, as, sole, ruler, william, threatened, to, leave, the, country, immediately, furthermore, she, remaining, loyal, to, her, husband, refused, the, house, of, commons, with, a, whig, majority, quickly, resolved, that, the, throne, was, vacant, and, that, it, was, safer, if, the, ruler, were, protestant, there, were, more, tories, in, the, house, of, lords, which, would, not, initially, agree, but, after, william, refused, to, be, a, regent, or, to, agree, to, remain, king, only, in, his, wife, s, lifetime, there, were, negotiations, between, the, two, houses, and, the, lords, agreed, by, a, narrow, majority, that, the, throne, was, vacant, on, 13, february, 1689, parliament, passed, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, in, which, it, deemed, that, james, by, attempting, to, flee, had, abdicated, the, government, of, the, realm, thereby, leaving, the, throne, vacant, the, crown, was, not, offered, to, james, s, infant, son, who, would, have, been, the, heir, apparent, under, normal, circumstances, but, to, william, and, mary, as, joint, sovereigns, it, was, however, provided, that, the, sole, and, full, exercise, of, the, regal, power, be, only, in, and, executed, by, the, said, prince, of, orange, in, the, names, of, the, said, prince, and, princess, during, their, joint, lives, william, and, mary, were, crowned, together, at, westminster, abbey, on, 11, april, 1689, by, the, bishop, of, london, henry, compton, normally, the, coronation, is, performed, by, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, but, the, archbishop, at, the, time, william, sancroft, refused, to, recognise, james, s, removal, william, also, summoned, a, convention, of, the, estates, of, scotland, which, met, on, 14, march, 1689, he, sent, it, a, conciliatory, letter, while, james, sent, haughty, uncompromising, orders, swaying, a, majority, in, favour, of, william, on, 11, april, the, day, of, the, english, coronation, the, convention, finally, declared, that, james, was, no, longer, king, of, scotland, william, and, mary, were, offered, the, scottish, crown, they, accepted, on, 11, may, william, encouraged, the, passage, of, the, toleration, act, 1689, which, guaranteed, religious, toleration, to, protestant, nonconformists, it, did, not, however, extend, toleration, as, far, as, he, wished, still, restricting, the, religious, liberty, of, roman, catholics, non, trinitarians, and, those, of, non, christian, faiths, in, december, 1689, one, of, the, most, important, constitutional, documents, in, english, history, the, bill, of, rights, was, passed, the, act, which, restated, and, confirmed, many, provisions, of, the, earlier, declaration, of, right, established, restrictions, on, the, royal, prerogative, it, provided, amongst, other, things, that, the, sovereign, could, not, suspend, laws, passed, by, parliament, levy, taxes, without, parliamentary, consent, infringe, the, right, to, petition, raise, a, standing, army, during, peacetime, without, parliamentary, consent, deny, the, right, to, bear, arms, to, protestant, subjects, unduly, interfere, with, parliamentary, elections, punish, members, of, either, house, of, parliament, for, anything, said, during, debates, require, excessive, bail, or, inflict, cruel, and, unusual, punishments, william, was, opposed, to, the, imposition, of, such, constraints, but, he, chose, not, to, engage, in, a, conflict, with, parliament, and, agreed, to, abide, by, the, statute, the, bill, of, rights, also, settled, the, question, of, succession, to, the, crown, after, the, death, of, either, william, or, mary, the, other, would, continue, to, reign, next, in, the, line, of, succession, was, mary, ii, s, sister, anne, and, her, issue, followed, by, any, children, william, might, have, had, by, a, subsequent, marriage, roman, catholics, as, well, as, those, who, married, catholics, were, excluded, although, most, in, britain, accepted, william, and, mary, as, sovereigns, a, significant, minority, refused, to, acknowledge, their, claim, to, the, throne, instead, believing, in, the, divine, right, of, kings, which, held, that, the, monarch, s, authority, derived, directly, from, god, rather, than, being, delegated, to, the, monarch, by, parliament, over, the, next, 57, years, jacobites, pressed, for, restoration, of, james, and, his, heirs, nonjurors, in, england, and, scotland, including, over, 400, clergy, and, several, bishops, of, the, church, of, england, and, scottish, episcopal, church, as, well, as, numerous, laymen, refused, to, take, oaths, of, allegiance, to, william, ireland, was, controlled, by, roman, catholics, loyal, to, james, and, franco, irish, jacobites, arrived, from, france, with, french, forces, in, march, 1689, to, join, the, war, in, ireland, and, contest, protestant, resistance, at, the, siege, of, derry, william, sent, his, navy, to, the, city, in, july, and, his, army, landed, in, august, after, progress, stalled, william, personally, intervened, to, lead, his, armies, to, victory, over, james, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, on, 1, july, 1690, after, which, james, fled, back, to, france, upon, william, s, return, to, england, his, close, friend, dutch, general, godert, de, ginkell, who, had, accompanied, william, to, ireland, and, had, commanded, a, body, of, dutch, cavalry, at, the, battle, of, the, boyne, was, named, commander, in, chief, of, william, s, forces, in, ireland, and, entrusted, with, further, conduct, of, the, war, there, ginkell, took, command, in, ireland, in, the, spring, of, 1691, and, following, the, battle, of, aughrim, succeeded, in, capturing, both, galway, and, limerick, thereby, effectively, suppressing, the, jacobite, forces, in, ireland, within, a, few, more, months, after, difficult, negotiations, a, capitulation, was, signed, on, 3, october, 1691, the, treaty, of, limerick, thus, concluded, the, williamite, pacification, of, ireland, and, for, his, services, the, dutch, general, received, the, formal, thanks, of, the, house, of, commons, and, was, awarded, the, title, of, earl, of, athlone, by, the, king, a, series, of, jacobite, risings, also, took, place, in, scotland, where, viscount, dundee, raised, highland, forces, and, won, a, victory, on, 27, july, 1689, at, the, battle, of, killiecrankie, but, he, died, in, the, fight, and, a, month, later, scottish, cameronian, forces, subdued, the, rising, at, the, battle, of, dunkeld, william, offered, scottish, clans, that, had, taken, part, in, the, rising, a, pardon, provided, that, they, signed, allegiance, by, a, deadline, and, his, government, in, scotland, punished, a, delay, with, the, 1692, massacre, of, glencoe, which, became, infamous, in, jacobite, propaganda, as, william, had, countersigned, the, orders, bowing, to, public, opinion, william, dismissed, those, responsible, for, the, massacre, though, they, still, remained, in, his, favour, in, the, words, of, the, historian, john, dalberg, acton, one, became, a, colonel, another, a, knight, a, third, a, peer, and, a, fourth, an, earl, william, s, reputation, in, scotland, suffered, further, damage, when, he, refused, english, assistance, to, the, darien, scheme, a, scottish, colony, 1698, 1700, that, failed, disastrously, although, the, whigs, were, william, s, strongest, supporters, he, initially, favoured, a, policy, of, balance, between, the, whigs, and, tories, the, marquess, of, halifax, a, man, known, for, his, ability, to, chart, a, moderate, political, course, gained, william, s, confidence, early, in, his, reign, the, whigs, a, majority, in, parliament, had, expected, to, dominate, the, government, and, were, disappointed, that, william, denied, them, this, chance, this, balanced, approach, to, governance, did, not, last, beyond, 1690, as, the, conflicting, factions, made, it, impossible, for, the, government, to, pursue, effective, policy, and, william, called, for, new, elections, early, that, year, after, the, parliamentary, elections, of, 1690, william, began, to, favour, the, tories, led, by, danby, and, nottingham, while, the, tories, favoured, preserving, the, king, s, prerogatives, william, found, them, unaccommodating, when, he, asked, parliament, to, support, his, continuing, war, with, france, as, a, result, william, began, to, prefer, the, whig, faction, known, as, the, junto, the, whig, government, was, responsible, for, the, creation, of, the, bank, of, england, following, the, example, of, the, bank, of, amsterdam, william, s, decision, to, grant, the, royal, charter, in, 1694, to, the, bank, of, england, a, private, institution, owned, by, bankers, is, his, most, relevant, economic, legacy, it, laid, the, financial, foundation, of, the, english, takeover, of, the, central, role, of, the, dutch, republic, and, bank, of, amsterdam, in, global, commerce, in, the, 18th, century, william, dissolved, parliament, in, 1695, and, the, new, parliament, that, assembled, that, year, was, led, by, the, whigs, the, following, year, parliament, passed, a, colonial, trade, bill, william, continued, to, absent, himself, from, britain, for, extended, periods, during, his, nine, years, war, 1688, 1697, against, france, leaving, each, spring, and, returning, to, england, each, autumn, england, joined, the, league, of, augsburg, which, then, became, known, as, the, grand, alliance, whilst, william, was, away, fighting, his, wife, mary, ii, governed, the, realm, but, acted, on, his, advice, each, time, he, returned, to, england, mary, gave, up, her, power, to, him, without, reservation, an, arrangement, that, lasted, for, the, rest, of, mary, s, life, after, the, anglo, dutch, fleet, defeated, a, french, fleet, at, la, hogue, in, 1692, the, allies, controlled, the, seas, for, the, rest, of, the, conflict, and, the, treaty, of, limerick, 1691, pacified, ireland, at, the, same, time, the, grand, alliance, fared, poorly, in, europe, as, william, lost, namur, in, the, spanish, netherlands, in, 1692, a, surprise, attack, on, the, french, under, the, command, of, the, duke, of, luxembourg, at, steenkerke, was, repulsed, and, the, french, defeated, the, allies, at, the, battle, of, landen, in, 1693, however, william, managed, to, inflict, such, damage, on, the, french, in, these, battles, that, further, major, french, offensives, were, ruled, out, the, following, year, the, allies, possessed, the, numerical, upper, hand, in, the, low, countries, this, enabled, william, to, recapture, huy, in, 1694, a, year, later, the, allies, achieved, their, grand, success, and, recaptured, namur, from, the, french, the, fortress, was, considered, one, of, the, strongest, fortresses, in, europe, and, the, conquest, was, a, major, blow, to, louis, xiv, s, reputation, william, s, rule, led, to, rapid, inflation, in, england, which, caused, widespread, hunger, from, 1693, onwards, the, nine, years, war, damaged, english, maritime, trade, and, led, to, a, doubling, in, taxation, these, factors, coupled, with, government, mismanagement, caused, a, currency, crisis, 1695, 1697, and, a, run, on, the, recently, created, bank, of, england, mary, ii, died, of, smallpox, on, 28, december, 1694, aged, only, 32, leaving, william, iii, to, rule, alone, william, deeply, mourned, his, wife, s, death, despite, his, conversion, to, anglicanism, william, s, popularity, in, england, plummeted, during, his, reign, as, a, sole, monarch, during, the, 1690s, rumours, grew, of, william, s, alleged, homosexual, inclinations, and, led, to, the, publication, of, many, satirical, pamphlets, by, his, jacobite, detractors, he, did, have, several, close, male, associates, including, two, dutch, courtiers, to, whom, he, granted, english, titles, hans, willem, bentinck, became, earl, of, portland, and, arnold, joost, van, keppel, was, created, earl, of, albemarle, these, relationships, with, male, friends, and, his, apparent, lack, of, mistresses, led, william, s, enemies, to, suggest, that, he, might, prefer, homosexual, relationships, william, s, modern, biographers, disagree, on, the, veracity, of, these, allegations, some, believe, there, may, have, been, truth, to, the, rumours, while, others, affirm, that, they, were, no, more, than, figments, of, his, enemies, imaginations, as, it, was, common, for, someone, childless, like, william, to, adopt, or, evince, paternal, affections, for, a, younger, man, whatever, the, case, bentinck, s, closeness, to, william, did, arouse, jealousies, at, the, royal, court, william, s, young, prot, g, keppel, aroused, more, gossip, and, suspicion, being, 20, years, william, s, junior, strikingly, handsome, and, having, risen, from, the, post, of, a, royal, page, to, an, earldom, with, some, ease, portland, wrote, to, william, in, 1697, that, the, kindness, which, your, majesty, has, for, a, young, man, and, the, way, in, which, you, seem, to, authorise, his, liberties, make, the, world, say, things, i, am, ashamed, to, hear, this, he, said, was, tarnishing, a, reputation, which, has, never, before, been, subject, to, such, accusations, william, tersely, dismissed, these, suggestions, however, saying, it, seems, to, me, very, extraordinary, that, it, should, be, impossible, to, have, esteem, and, regard, for, a, young, man, without, it, being, criminal, in, 1696, the, dutch, territory, of, drenthe, made, william, its, stadtholder, in, the, same, year, jacobites, plotted, to, assassinate, william, in, an, attempt, to, restore, james, to, the, english, throne, the, plan, failed, and, support, for, william, surged, parliament, passed, a, bill, of, attainder, against, the, ringleader, john, fenwick, and, he, was, beheaded, in, 1697, in, accordance, with, the, treaty, of, rijswijk, 20, september, 1697, which, ended, the, nine, years, war, king, louis, xiv, recognised, william, iii, as, king, of, england, and, undertook, to, give, no, further, assistance, to, james, ii, thus, deprived, of, french, dynastic, backing, after, 1697, jacobites, posed, no, further, serious, threats, during, william, s, reign, as, his, life, drew, towards, its, conclusion, william, like, many, other, contemporary, european, rulers, felt, concern, over, the, question, of, succession, to, the, throne, of, spain, which, brought, with, it, vast, territories, in, italy, the, low, countries, and, the, new, world, charles, ii, of, spain, was, an, invalid, with, no, prospect, of, having, children, some, of, his, closest, relatives, included, louis, xiv, of, france, and, leopold, i, holy, roman, emperor, william, sought, to, prevent, the, spanish, inheritance, from, going, to, either, monarch, for, he, feared, that, such, a, calamity, would, upset, the, balance, of, power, william, and, louis, agreed, to, the, first, partition, treaty, 1698, which, provided, for, the, division, of, the, spanish, empire, joseph, ferdinand, electoral, prince, of, bavaria, would, obtain, spain, while, france, and, the, holy, roman, emperor, would, divide, the, remaining, territories, between, them, charles, ii, accepted, the, nomination, of, joseph, ferdinand, as, his, heir, and, war, appeared, to, be, averted, when, however, joseph, ferdinand, died, of, smallpox, in, february, 1699, the, issue, re, opened, in, 1700, william, and, louis, agreed, to, the, second, partition, treaty, also, called, the, treaty, of, london, under, which, the, territories, in, italy, would, pass, to, a, son, of, the, king, of, france, and, the, other, spanish, territories, would, be, inherited, by, a, son, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, this, arrangement, infuriated, both, the, spanish, who, still, sought, to, prevent, the, dissolution, of, their, empire, and, the, holy, roman, emperor, who, regarded, the, italian, territories, as, much, more, useful, than, the, other, lands, unexpectedly, charles, ii, of, spain, interfered, as, he, lay, dying, in, late, 1700, unilaterally, he, willed, all, spanish, territories, to, philip, duke, of, anjou, a, grandson, of, louis, xiv, the, french, conveniently, ignored, the, second, partition, treaty, and, claimed, the, entire, spanish, inheritance, furthermore, louis, alienated, william, iii, by, recognising, james, francis, edward, stuart, the, son, of, the, former, king, james, ii, who, died, in, september, 1701, as, de, jure, king, of, england, the, subsequent, conflict, known, as, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, broke, out, in, july, 1701, and, continued, until, 1713, 1714, another, royal, inheritance, apart, from, that, of, spain, also, concerned, william, his, marriage, with, mary, had, not, produced, any, children, and, he, did, not, seem, likely, to, remarry, mary, s, sister, anne, had, borne, numerous, children, all, of, whom, died, during, childhood, the, death, of, her, last, surviving, child, prince, william, duke, of, gloucester, in, 1700, left, her, as, the, only, individual, in, the, line, of, succession, established, by, the, bill, of, rights, as, the, complete, exhaustion, of, the, defined, line, of, succession, would, have, encouraged, a, restoration, of, james, ii, s, line, the, english, parliament, passed, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, which, provided, that, if, anne, died, without, surviving, issue, and, william, failed, to, have, surviving, issue, by, any, subsequent, marriage, the, crown, would, pass, to, a, distant, relative, sophia, electress, of, hanover, a, granddaughter, of, james, i, and, to, her, protestant, heirs, the, act, debarred, roman, catholics, from, the, throne, thereby, excluding, the, candidacy, of, several, dozen, people, more, closely, related, to, mary, and, anne, than, sophia, the, act, extended, to, england, and, ireland, but, not, to, scotland, whose, estates, had, not, been, consulted, before, the, selection, of, sophia, in, 1702, william, died, of, pneumonia, a, complication, from, a, broken, collarbone, following, a, fall, from, his, horse, sorrel, it, was, rumoured, that, the, horse, had, been, confiscated, from, sir, john, fenwick, one, of, the, jacobites, who, had, conspired, against, william, because, his, horse, had, stumbled, into, a, mole, s, burrow, many, jacobites, toasted, the, little, gentleman, in, the, black, velvet, waistcoat, years, later, winston, churchill, in, his, a, history, of, the, english, speaking, peoples, stated, that, the, fall, opened, the, door, to, a, troop, of, lurking, foes, william, was, buried, in, westminster, abbey, alongside, his, wife, his, sister, in, law, and, cousin, anne, became, queen, regnant, of, england, scotland, and, ireland, william, s, death, meant, that, he, would, remain, the, only, member, of, the, dutch, house, of, orange, to, reign, over, england, members, of, this, house, had, served, as, stadtholder, of, holland, and, the, majority, of, the, other, provinces, of, the, dutch, republic, since, the, time, of, william, the, silent, william, i, the, five, provinces, of, which, william, iii, was, stadtholder, holland, zeeland, utrecht, gelderland, and, overijssel, all, suspended, the, office, after, his, death, thus, he, was, the, last, patrilineal, descendant, of, william, i, to, be, named, stadtholder, for, the, majority, of, the, provinces, under, william, iii, s, will, john, william, friso, stood, to, inherit, the, principality, of, orange, as, well, as, several, lordships, in, the, netherlands, he, was, william, s, closest, agnatic, relative, as, well, as, grandson, of, william, s, aunt, henriette, catherine, however, frederick, i, of, prussia, also, claimed, the, principality, as, the, senior, cognatic, heir, his, mother, louise, henriette, being, henriette, catherine, s, older, sister, under, the, treaty, of, utrecht, 1713, frederick, i, s, successor, frederick, william, i, of, prussia, ceded, his, territorial, claim, to, louis, xiv, keeping, only, a, claim, to, the, title, friso, s, posthumous, son, william, iv, succeeded, to, the, title, at, his, birth, in, 1711, in, the, treaty, of, partition, 1732, william, iv, agreed, to, share, the, title, prince, of, orange, with, frederick, william, he, was, a, great, man, an, enemy, of, france, to, which, he, did, a, great, deal, of, harm, but, we, owe, him, our, esteem, william, s, primary, achievement, was, to, contain, france, when, it, was, in, a, position, to, impose, its, will, across, much, of, europe, his, life, s, aim, was, largely, to, oppose, louis, xiv, of, france, this, effort, continued, after, his, death, during, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, another, important, consequence, of, william, s, reign, in, england, involved, the, ending, of, a, bitter, conflict, between, crown, and, parliament, that, had, lasted, since, the, accession, of, the, first, english, monarch, of, the, house, of, stuart, james, i, in, 1603, the, conflict, over, royal, and, parliamentary, power, had, led, to, the, english, civil, war, during, the, 1640s, and, the, glorious, revolution, of, 1688, during, william, s, reign, however, the, conflict, was, settled, in, parliament, s, favour, by, the, bill, of, rights, 1689, the, triennial, act, 1694, and, the, act, of, settlement, 1701, the, historical, verdict, on, william, s, qualities, as, an, army, commander, is, mixed, many, contemporaries, agreed, that, he, was, a, great, field, commander, even, his, enemies, spoke, highly, of, him, the, marquis, de, quincy, for, example, wrote, that, it, was, due, to, william, s, insight, and, personal, courage, that, the, allies, held, out, at, the, battle, of, seneffe, while, he, also, praises, how, william, led, his, troops, to, safety, during, the, battles, of, steenkerque, and, landen, still, william, has, been, blamed, by, french, and, british, historians, for, his, impatience, and, recklessness, and, for, treating, lightly, his, life, and, the, lives, of, his, soldiers, british, historian, john, childs, acknowledges, william, s, great, qualities, but, feels, that, he, fell, short, as, a, field, commander, because, by, often, throwing, himself, into, the, fray, he, no, longer, had, the, complete, oversight, william, commanded, several, field, battles, battle, of, seneffe, 1674, battle, of, cassel, 1677, battle, of, saint, denis, 1678, battle, of, the, boyne, 1690, battle, of, steenkerque, 1692, and, the, battle, of, landen, while, most, of, these, were, defeats, it, would, be, wrong, to, place, the, responsibility, solely, on, him, he, was, up, against, a, strong, uniformly, organised, army, with, a, coalition, army, many, of, the, coalition, troops, were, not, as, practised, and, disciplined, as, the, dutch, troops, and, it, took, time, to, incorporate, them, into, the, dutch, system, william, did, not, attach, much, value, to, traditional, victory, signs, either, he, considered, himself, a, winner, if, he, managed, to, inflate, french, losses, to, the, point, where, french, offensive, plans, had, to, be, abandoned, the, battles, he, fought, were, almost, all, ones, of, attrition, that, the, allies, also, suffered, many, casualties, he, took, for, granted, the, dutch, army, organisation, was, prepared, for, that, and, from, 1689, so, was, england, s, william, endowed, the, college, of, william, and, mary, in, present, day, williamsburg,

princeton, university, think, that, the, town, of, princeton, new, jersey, and, hence, the, university, were, named, in, his, honour, this, is, probably, untrue, although, nassau, hall, the, college,
