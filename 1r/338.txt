to, follow, in, apollo, s, footsteps, and, his, choice, of, exile, over, resistance, were, a, source, of, lifelong, guilt, for, conrad, because, of, the, father, s, attempts, at, farming, and, his,

physicians, supposed, that, fresh, air, and, physical, work, would, harden, him, his, uncle, hoped, that, well, defined, duties, and, the, rigors, of, work, would, teach, him, discipline, since, he, showed, little, inclination, to, study, it, was, essential, that, he, learn, a, trade, his, uncle, thought, he, could, work, as, a, sailor, cum, businessman, who, would, combine, maritime, skills,

writer, he, disliked, all, restrictions, at, home, at, school, or, in, the, living, room, he, would, sprawl, unceremoniously, he, suffer, from, severe, headaches, and, nervous, attacks, conrad, had, been, at, the, establishment, for, just, over, a, year, when, in, september, 1874, for, uncertain, reasons, his, uncle, removed, him, from, school, in, lw, w, and, took, him, back, to, krak, w, on, 13, october, 1874, bobrowski, sent, the, sixteen, year, old, to, marseilles, france, for, conrad, s, planned, merchant, marine, career, on, french, merchant, ships, providing, him, with, a, monthly, stipend, of, 150, francs, though, conrad, had, not, completed, secondary, school, his, accomplishments, included, fluency, in, french, with, a, correct, accent, some, knowledge, of, latin, german, and, greek, probably, a, good, knowledge, of, history, some, geography, and, probably, already, an, interest, in, physics, he, was, well, read, particularly, in, polish, romantic, literature, he, belonged, to, the, second, generation, in, his, family, that, had, had, to, earn, a, living, outside, the, family, estates, they, were, born, and, reared, partly, in, the, milieu, of, the, working, intelligentsia, a, social, class, that, was, starting, to, play, an, important, role, in, central, and, eastern, europe, he, had, absorbed, enough, of, the, history, culture, and, literature, of, his, native, land, to, be, able, eventually, to, develop, a, distinctive, world, view, and, make, unique, contributions, to, the, literature, of, his, adoptive, britain, tensions, that, originated, in, his, childhood, in, poland, and, increasing, in, his, adulthood, abroad, contributed, to, conrad, s, greatest, literary, achievements, zdzis, aw, najder, himself, an, emigrant, from, poland, observed, living, away, from, one, s, natural, environment, family, friends, social, group, language, even, if, it, results, from, a, conscious, decision, usually, gives, rise, to, internal, tensions, because, it, tends, to, make, people, less, sure, of, themselves, more, vulnerable, less, certain, of, their, position, and, value, the, polish, szlachta, and, intelligentsia, were, social, strata, in, which, reputation, was, felt, very, important, for, a, feeling, of, self, worth, men, strove, to, find, confirmation, of, their, self, regard, in, the, eyes, of, others, such, a, psychological, heritage, forms, both, a, spur, to, ambition, and, a, source, of, constant, stress, especially, if, the, idea, of, s, public, duty, some, critics, have, suggested, that, when, conrad, left, poland, he, wanted, to, break, once, and, for, all, with, his, polish, past, in, refutation, of, this, najder, quotes, from, conrad, s, 14, august, 1883, letter, to, family, friend, stefan, buszczy, ski, written, nine, years, after, conrad, had, left, poland, i, always, remember, what, you, said, when, i, was, leaving, remember, you, said, wherever, you, may, sail, you, are, sailing, towards, poland, that, i, have, never, forgotten, and, never, will, forget, in, marseilles, conrad, had, an, intense, social, life, often, stretching, his, budget, a, trace, of, these, years, can, be, found, in, the, northern, corsica, town, of, luri, where, there, is, a, plaque, to, a, corsican, merchant, seaman, dominique, cervoni, whom, conrad, befriended, cervoni, became, the, inspiration, for, some, of, conrad, s, characters, such, as, the, title, character, of, the, 1904, novel, nostromo, conrad, visited, corsica, with, his, wife, in, 1921, partly, in, search, of, connections, with, his, long, dead, friend, and, fellow, merchant, seaman, in, late, 1877, conrad, s, maritime, career, was, interrupted, by, the, refusal, of, the, russian, consul, to, provide, documents, needed, for, him, to, continue, his, service, as, a, result, conrad, fell, into, debt, and, in, march, 1878, he, attempted, suicide, he, survived, and, received, further, financial, aid, from, his, uncle, allowing, him, to, resume, his, normal, life, after, nearly, four, years, in, france, and, on, french, ships, conrad, joined, the, british, merchant, marine, enlisting, in, april, 1878, he, had, most, likely, started, learning, english, shortly, before, for, the, next, fifteen, years, he, served, under, the, red, ensign, he, worked, on, a, variety, of, ships, as, crew, member, steward, apprentice, able, seaman, and, then, as, third, second, and, first, mate, until, eventually, achieving, captain, s, rank, during, the, 19, years, from, the, time, that, conrad, had, left, krak, w, in, october, 1874, until, he, signed, off, the, adowa, in, january, 1894, he, had, worked, in, ships, including, long, periods, in, port, for, 10, years, and, almost, 8, months, he, had, spent, just, over, 8, years, at, sea, 9, months, of, it, as, a, passenger, his, sole, captaincy, took, place, in, 1888, 89, when, he, commanded, the, barque, otago, from, sydney, to, mauritius, during, a, brief, call, in, india, in, 1885, 86, 28, year, old, conrad, sent, five, letters, to, joseph, spiridion, a, pole, eight, years, his, senior, whom, he, had, befriended, at, cardiff, in, june, 1885, just, before, sailing, for, singapore, in, the, clipper, ship, tilkhurst, these, letters, are, conrad, s, first, preserved, texts, in, english, his, english, is, generally, correct, but, stiff, to, the, point, of, artificiality, many, fragments, suggest, that, his, thoughts, ran, along, the, lines, of, polish, syntax, and, phraseology, more, importantly, the, letters, show, a, marked, change, in, views, from, those, implied, in, his, earlier, correspondence, of, 1881, 83, he, had, abandoned, hope, for, the, future, and, the, conceit, of, sailing, toward, poland, and, his, panslavic, ideas, he, was, left, with, a, painful, sense, of, the, hopelessness, of, the, polish, question, and, an, acceptance, of, england, as, a, possible, refuge, while, he, often, adjusted, his, statements, to, accord, to, some, extent, with, the, views, of, his, addressees, the, theme, of, hopelessness, concerning, the, prospects, for, polish, independence, often, occurs, authentically, in, his, correspondence, and, works, before, 1914, the, year, 1890, marked, conrad, s, first, return, to, poland, where, he, would, visit, his, uncle, and, other, relatives, and, acquaintances, this, visit, took, place, while, he, was, waiting, to, proceed, to, the, congo, free, state, having, been, hired, by, albert, thys, deputy, director, of, the, soci, t, anonyme, belge, pour, le, commerce, du, haut, congo, conrad, s, association, with, the, belgian, company, on, the, congo, river, would, inspire, his, novella, heart, of, darkness, during, this, 1890, period, in, the, congo, conrad, befriended, roger, casement, who, was, also, working, for, thys, operating, a, trading, and, transport, station, in, matadi, in, 1903, as, british, consul, to, boma, casement, was, commissioned, to, investigate, abuses, in, the, congo, and, later, in, amazonian, peru, and, was, knighted, in, 1911, for, his, advocacy, of, human, rights, casement, later, became, active, in, irish, republicanism, after, leaving, the, british, consular, service, conrad, left, africa, at, the, end, of, december, 1890, arriving, in, brussels, by, late, january, of, the, following, year, he, rejoined, the, british, merchant, marines, as, first, mate, in, november, when, he, left, london, on, 25, october, 1892, aboard, the, passenger, clipper, ship, torrens, one, of, the, passengers, was, william, henry, jacques, a, consumptive, cambridge, university, graduate, who, died, less, than, a, year, later, on, 19, september, 1893, according, to, conrad, s, a, personal, record, jacques, was, the, first, reader, of, the, still, unfinished, manuscript, of, conrad, s, almayer, s, folly, jacques, encouraged, conrad, to, continue, writing, the, novel, conrad, completed, his, last, long, distance, voyage, as, a, seaman, on, 26, july, 1893, when, the, torrens, docked, at, london, and, j, conrad, korzemowin, per, the, certificate, of, discharge, debarked, when, the, torrens, had, left, adelaide, on, 13, march, 1893, the, passengers, had, included, two, young, englishmen, returning, from, australia, and, new, zealand, 25, year, old, lawyer, and, future, novelist, john, galsworthy, and, edward, lancelot, sanderson, who, was, going, to, help, his, father, run, a, boys, preparatory, school, at, elstree, they, were, probably, the, first, englishmen, and, non, sailors, with, whom, conrad, struck, up, a, friendship, and, he, would, remain, in, touch, with, both, in, one, of, galsworthy, s, first, literary, attempts, the, doldrums, 1895, 96, the, protagonist, first, mate, armand, is, modelled, after, conrad, at, cape, town, where, the, torrens, remained, from, 17, to, 19, may, galsworthy, left, the, ship, to, look, at, the, local, mines, sanderson, continued, his, voyage, and, seems, to, have, been, the, first, to, develop, closer, ties, with, conrad, later, that, year, conrad, would, visit, his, relatives, in, poland, and, ukraine, once, again, in, the, autumn, of, 1889, conrad, began, writing, his, first, novel, almayer, s, folly, he, son, of, a, writer, praised, by, his, uncle, for, the, beautiful, style, of, his, letters, the, man, who, from, the, very, first, page, showed, a, serious, professional, approach, to, his, work, presented, his, start, on, almayer, s, folly, as, a, casual, and, non, binding, incident, et, he, must, have, felt, a, pronounced, need, to, write, every, page, right, from, th, first, one, testifies, that, writing, was, not, something, he, took, up, for, amusement, or, to, pass, time, just, the, contrary, it, was, a, serious, undertaking, supported, by, careful, diligent, reading, of, the, masters, and, aimed, at, shaping, his, own, attitude, to, art, and, to, reality, e, do, not, know, the, sources, of, his, artistic, impulses, and, creative, gifts, conrad, s, later, letters, to, literary, friends, show, the, attention, that, he, devoted, to, analysis, of, style, to, individual, words, and, expressions, to, the, emotional, tone, of, phrases, to, the, atmosphere, created, by, language, in, this, conrad, in, his, own, way, followed, the, example, of, gustave, flaubert, notorious, for, searching, days, on, end, for, le, mot, juste, for, the, right, word, to, render, the, essence, of, the, matter, najder, opined, riting, in, a, foreign, language, admits, a, greater, temerity, in, tackling, personally, sensitive, problems, for, it, leaves, uncommitted, the, most, spontaneous, deeper, reaches, of, the, psyche, and, allows, a, greater, distance, in, treating, matters, we, would, hardly, dare, approach, in, the, language, of, our, childhood, as, a, rule, it, is, easier, both, to, swear, and, to, analyze, dispassionately, in, an, acquired, language, in, 1894, aged, 36, conrad, reluctantly, gave, up, the, sea, partly, because, of, poor, health, partly, due, to, unavailability, of, ships, and, partly, because, he, had, become, so, fascinated, with, writing, that, he, had, decided, on, a, literary, career, almayer, s, folly, set, on, the, east, coast, of, borneo, was, published, in, 1895, its, appearance, marked, his, first, use, of, the, pen, name, joseph, conrad, konrad, was, of, course, the, third, of, his, polish, given, names, but, his, use, of, it, in, the, anglicised, version, conrad, may, also, have, been, an, homage, to, the, polish, romantic, poet, adam, mickiewicz, s, patriotic, narrative, poem, konrad, wallenrod, edward, garnett, a, young, publisher, s, reader, and, literary, critic, who, would, play, one, of, the, chief, supporting, roles, in, conrad, s, literary, career, had, like, unwin, s, first, reader, of, almayer, s, folly, wilfrid, hugh, chesson, been, impressed, by, the, manuscript, but, garnett, had, been, uncertain, whether, the, english, was, good, enough, for, publication, garnett, had, shown, the, novel, to, his, wife, constance, garnett, later, a, translator, of, russian, literature, she, had, thought, conrad, s, foreignness, a, positive, merit, while, conrad, had, only, limited, personal, acquaintance, with, the, peoples, of, maritime, southeast, asia, the, region, looms, large, in, his, early, work, according, to, najder, conrad, the, exile, and, wanderer, was, aware, of, a, difficulty, that, he, confessed, more, than, once, the, lack, of, a, common, cultural, background, with, his, anglophone, readers, meant, he, could, not, compete, with, english, language, authors, writing, about, the, english, speaking, world, at, the, same, time, the, choice, of, a, non, english, colonial, setting, freed, him, from, an, embarrassing, division, of, loyalty, almayer, s, folly, and, later, an, outpost, of, progress, 1897, set, in, a, congo, exploited, by, king, leopold, ii, of, belgium, and, heart, of, darkness, 1899, likewise, set, in, the, congo, contain, bitter, reflections, on, colonialism, the, malay, states, came, theoretically, under, the, suzerainty, of, the, dutch, government, conrad, did, not, write, about, the, area, s, british, dependencies, which, he, never, visited, he, was, apparently, intrigued, by, struggles, aimed, at, preserving, national, independence, the, prolific, and, destructive, richness, of, tropical, nature, and, the, dreariness, of, human, life, within, it, accorded, well, with, the, pessimistic, mood, of, his, early, works, almayer, s, folly, together, with, its, successor, an, outcast, of, the, islands, 1896, laid, the, foundation, for, conrad, s, reputation, as, a, romantic, teller, of, exotic, tales, a, misunderstanding, of, his, purpose, that, was, to, frustrate, him, for, the, rest, of, his, career, almost, all, of, conrad, s, writings, were, first, published, in, newspapers, and, magazines, influential, reviews, like, the, fortnightly, review, and, the, north, american, review, avant, garde, publications, like, the, savoy, new, review, and, the, english, review, popular, short, fiction, magazines, like, the, saturday, evening, post, and, harper, s, magazine, women, s, journals, like, the, pictorial, review, and, romance, mass, circulation, dailies, like, the, daily, mail, and, the, new, york, herald, and, illustrated, newspapers, like, the, illustrated, london, news, and, the, illustrated, buffalo, express, he, also, wrote, for, the, outlook, an, imperialist, weekly, magazine, between, 1898, and, 1906, financial, success, long, eluded, conrad, who, often, requested, advances, from, magazine, and, book, publishers, and, loans, from, acquaintances, such, as, john, galsworthy, eventually, a, government, grant, civil, list, pension, of, 100, per, annum, awarded, on, 9, august, 1910, somewhat, relieved, his, financial, worries, and, in, time, collectors, began, purchasing, his, manuscripts, though, his, talent, was, early, on, recognised, by, english, intellectuals, popular, success, eluded, him, until, the, 1913, publication, of, chance, which, is, often, considered, one, of, his, weaker, novels, conrad, was, a, reserved, man, wary, of, showing, emotion, he, scorned, sentimentality, his, manner, of, portraying, emotion, in, his, books, was, full, of, restraint, scepticism, and, irony, in, the, words, of, his, uncle, bobrowski, as, a, young, man, conrad, was, extremely, sensitive, conceited, reserved, and, in, addition, excitable, in, short, all, the, defects, of, the, na, cz, family, conrad, suffered, throughout, life, from, ill, health, physical, and, mental, a, newspaper, review, of, a, conrad, biography, suggested, that, the, book, could, have, been, subtitled, thirty, years, of, debt, gout, depression, and, angst, in, 1891, he, was, hospitalised, for, several, months, suffering, from, gout, neuralgic, pains, in, his, right, arm, and, recurrent, attacks, of, malaria, he, also, complained, of, swollen, hands, which, made, writing, difficult, taking, his, uncle, tadeusz, bobrowski, s, advice, he, convalesced, at, a, spa, in, switzerland, conrad, had, a, phobia, of, dentistry, neglecting, his, teeth, until, they, had, to, be, extracted, in, one, letter, he, remarked, that, every, novel, he, had, written, had, cost, him, a, tooth, conrad, s, physical, afflictions, were, if, anything, less, vexatious, than, his, mental, ones, in, his, letters, he, often, described, symptoms, of, depression, the, evidence, writes, najder, is, so, strong, that, it, is, nearly, impossible, to, doubt, it, in, march, 1878, at, the, end,

had, fallen, into, debt, bobrowski, described, his, subsequent, study, of, his, nephew, in, an, extensive, letter, to, stefan, buszczy, ski, his, own, ideological, opponent, and, a, friend, of, conrad, s, late, father, apollo, to, what, extent, the, suicide, attempt, had, been, made, in, earnest, likely, will, never, be, known, but, it, is, suggestive, of, a, situational, depression, in, 1888, during, a, stop, over, on, mauritius, in, the, indian, ocean, conrad, developed, a, couple, of, romantic, interests, one, of, these, would, be, described, in, his, 1910, story, a, smile, of, fortune, which, contains, autobiographical, elements, e, g, one, of, the, characters, is, the, same, chief, mate, burns, who, appears, in, the, shadow, line, the, narrator, a, young, captain, flirts,

louis, at, the, time, there, was, a, 17, year, old, alice, shaw, whose, father, a, shipping, agent, owned, the, only, rose, garden, in, town, more, is, known, about, conrad, s, other, more, open,

the, inhabitants, were, descendants, of, the, original, french, colonists, and, conrad, s, excellent, french, and, perfect, manners, opened, all, local, salons, to, him, he, became, a, frequent, guest, at, the, schmidts, where, he, often, met, the, misses, renouf, a, couple, of, days, before, leaving, port, louis, conrad, asked, one, of, the, renouf, brothers, for, the, hand, of, his, 26, year, old, sister, eugenie, she, was, already, however, engaged, to, marry, her, pharmacist, cousin, after, the, rebuff, conrad, did, not, pay, a, farewell, visit, but, sent, a, polite, letter, to, gabriel, renouf, saying, he, would, never, return, to, mauritius, and, adding, that, on, the, day, of, the, wedding, his, thoughts, would, be, with, them, on, 24, march, 1896, conrad, married, an, englishwoman, jessie, george, the, couple, had, two, sons, borys, and, john, the, elder, borys, proved, a, disappointment, in, scholarship, and, integrity, jessie, was, an, unsophisticated, working, class, girl, sixteen, years, younger, than, conrad, to, his, friends, she, was, an, inexplicable, choice, of, wife, and, the, subject, of, some, rather, disparaging, and, unkind, remarks, see, lady, ottoline, morrell, s, opinion, of, jessie, in, impressions, however, according, to, other, biographers, such, as, frederick, karl, jessie, provided, what, conrad, needed, namely, a, straightforward, devoted, quite, competent, companion, similarly, jones, remarks, that, despite, whatever, difficulties, the, marriage, endured, there, can, be, no, doubt, that, the, relationship, sustained, conrad, s, career, as, a, writer, which, might, have, been, much, less, successful, without, her, the, couple, rented, a, long, series, of, successive, homes, mostly, in, the, english, countryside, conrad, who, suffered, frequent, depressions, made, great, efforts, to, change, his, mood, the, most, important, step, was, to, move, into, another, house, his, frequent, changes, of, home, were, usually, signs, of, a, search, for, psychological, regeneration, between, 1910, and, 1919, conrad, s, home, was, capel, house, in, orlestone, kent, which, was, rented, to, him, by, lord, and, lady, oliver, it, was, here, that, he, wrote, the, rescue, victory, and, the, arrow, of, gold, except, for, several, vacations, in, france, and, italy, a, 1914, vacation, in, his, native, poland, and, a, 1923, visit, to, the, united, states, conrad, lived, the, rest, of, his, life, in, england, the, 1914, vacation, with, his, wife, and, sons, in, poland, at, the, urging, of, j, zef, retinger, coincided, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, on, 28, july, 1914, the, day, war, broke, out, between, austro, hungary, and, serbia, conrad, and, the, retingers, arrived, in, krak, w, then, in, the, austro, hungarian, empire, where, conrad, visited, childhood, haunts, as, the, city, lay, only, a, few, miles, from, the, russian, border, there, was, a, risk, of, being, stranded, in, a, battle, zone, with, wife, jessie, and, younger, son, john, ill, conrad, decided, to, take, refuge, in, the, mountain, resort, town, of, zakopane, they, left, krak, w, on, 2, august, a, few, days, after, arrival, in, zakopane, they, moved, to, the, konstantyn, wka, pension, operated, by, conrad, s, cousin, aniela, zag, rska, it, had, been, frequented, by, celebrities, including, the, statesman, j, zef, pi, sudski, and, conrad, s, acquaintance, the, young, concert, pianist, artur, rubinstein, zag, rska, introduced, conrad, to, polish, writers, intellectuals, and, artists, who, had, also, taken, refuge, in, zakopane, including, novelist, stefan, eromski, and, tadeusz, nalepi, ski, a, writer, friend, of, anthropologist, bronis, aw, malinowski, conrad, aroused, interest, among, the, poles, as, a, famous, writer, and, an, exotic, compatriot, from, abroad, he, charmed, new, acquaintances, especially, women, however, marie, curie, s, physician, sister, bronis, awa, d, uska, wife, of, fellow, physician, and, eminent, socialist, activist, kazimierz, d, uski, openly, berated, conrad, for, having, used, his, great, talent, for, purposes, other, than, bettering, the, future, of, his, native, land, but, thirty, two, year, old, aniela, zag, rska, daughter, of, the, pension, keeper, conrad, s, niece, who, would, translate, his, works, into, polish, in, 1923, 39, idolised, him, kept, him, company, and, provided, him, with, books, he, particularly, delighted, in, the, stories, and, novels, of, the, ten, years, older, recently, deceased, boles, aw, prus, who, also, had, visited, zakopane, read, everything, by, his, fellow, victim, of, poland, s, 1863, uprising, my, beloved, prus, that, he, could, get, his, hands, on, and, pronounced, him, better, than, dickens, a, favourite, english, novelist, of, conrad, s, conrad, who, was, noted, by, his, polish, acquaintances, to, still, be, fluent, in, his, native, tongue, participated, in, their, impassioned, political, discussions, he, declared, presciently, as, j, zef, pi, sudski, had, earlier, in, 1914, in, paris, that, in, the, war, for, poland, to, regain, independence, russia, must, be, beaten, by, the, central, powers, the, austro, hungarian, and, german, empires, and, the, central, powers, must, in, turn, be, beaten, by, france, and, britain, after, many, travails, and, vicissitudes, at, the, beginning, of, november, 1914, conrad, managed, to, bring, his, family, back, to, england, on, his, return, he, was, determined, to, work, on, swaying, british, opinion, in, favour, of, restoring, poland, s, sovereignty, jessie, conrad, would, later, write, in, her, memoirs, i, understood, my, husband, so, much, better, after, those, months, in, poland, so, many, characteristics, that, had, been, strange, and, unfathomable, to, me, before, took, as, it, were, their, right, proportions, i, understood, that, his, temperament, was, that, of, his, countrymen, biographer, zdzis, aw, najder, wrote, conrad, was, passionately, concerned, with, politics, is, confirmed, by, several, of, his, works, starting, with, almayer, s, folly, nostromo, revealed, his, concern, with, these, matters, more, fully, it, was, of, course, a, concern, quite, natural, for, someone, from, a, country, where, politics, was, a, matter, not, only, of, everyday, existence, but, also, of, life, and, death, moreover, conrad, himself, came, from, a, social, class, that, claimed, exclusive, responsibility, for, state, affairs, and, from, a, very, politically, active, family, norman, douglas, sums, it, up, conrad, was, first, and, foremost, a, pole, and, like, many, poles, a, politician, and, moralist, malgr, lui, these, are, his, fundamentals, conrad, see, political, problems, in, terms, of, a, continuous, struggle, between, law, and, violence, anarchy, and, order, freedom, and, autocracy, material, interests, and, the, noble, idealism, of, individuals, was, conrad, s, historical, awareness, his, polish, experience, endowed, him, with, the, perception, exceptional, in, the, western, european, literature, of, his, time, of, how, winding, and, constantly, changing, were, the, front, lines, in, these, struggles, the, most, extensive, and, ambitious, political, statement, that, conrad, ever, made, was, his, 1905, essay, autocracy, and, war, whose, starting, point, was, the, russo, japanese, war, he, finished, the, article, a, month, before, the, battle, of, tsushima, strait, the, essay, begins, with, a, statement, about, russia, s, incurable, weakness, and, ends, with, warnings, against, prussia, the, dangerous, aggressor, in, a, future, european, war, for, russia, he, predicted, a, violent, outburst, in, the, near, future, but, russia, s, lack, of, democratic, traditions, and, the, backwardness, of, her, masses, made, it, impossible, for, the, revolution, to, have, a, salutary, effect, conrad, regarded, the, formation, of, a, representative, government, in, russia, as, unfeasible, and, foresaw, a, transition, from, autocracy, to, dictatorship, he, saw, western, europe, as, torn, by, antagonisms, engendered, by, economic, rivalry, and, commercial, selfishness, in, vain, might, a, russian, revolution, seek, advice, or, help, from, a, materialistic, and, egoistic, western, europe, that, armed, itself, in, preparation, for, wars, far, more, brutal, than, those, of, the, past, conrad, s, distrust, of, democracy, sprang, from, his, doubts, whether, the, propagation, of, democracy, as, an, aim, in, itself, could, solve, any, problems, he, thought, that, in, view, of, the, weakness, of, human, nature, and, of, the, criminal, character, of, society, democracy, offered, boundless, opportunities, for, demagogues, and, charlatans, conrad, kept, his, distance, from, partisan, politics, and, never, voted, in, british, national, elections, he, accused, social, democrats, of, his, time, of, acting, to, weaken, the, national, sentiment, the, preservation, of, which, concern, of, attempting, to, dissolve, national, identities, in, an, impersonal, melting, pot, i, look, at, the, future, from, the, depth, of, a, very, black, past, and, i, find, that, nothing, is, left, for, me, except, fidelity, to, a, cause, lost, to, an, idea, without, future, it, was, conrad, s, hopeless, fidelity, to, the, memory, of, poland, that, prevented, him, from, believing, in, the, idea, of, international, fraternity, which, he, considered, under, the, circumstances, just, a, verbal, exercise, he, resented, some, socialists, talk, of, freedom, and, world, brotherhood, while, keeping, silent, about, his, own, partitioned, and, oppressed, poland, before, that, in, the, early, 1880s, letters, to, conrad, from, his, uncle, tadeusz, show, conrad, apparently, having, hoped, for, an, improvement, in, poland, s, situation, not, through, a, liberation, movement, but, by, establishing, an, alliance, with, neighbouring, slavic, nations, this, had, been, accompanied, by, a, faith, in, the, panslavic, ideology, surprising, najder, writes, in, a, man, who, was, later, to, emphasize, his, hostility, towards, russia, a, conviction, that, poland, s, civilization, and, historic, traditions, would, her, play, a, leading, role, in, the, panslavic, community, doubts, about, poland, s, chances, of, becoming, a, fully, sovereign, nation, state, conrad, s, alienation, from, partisan, politics, went, together, with, an, abiding, sense, of, the, thinking, man, s, burden, imposed, by, his, personality, as, described, in, an, 1894, letter, by, conrad, to, a, relative, by, marriage, and, fellow, author, marguerite, poradowska, n, e, gachet, and, cousin, of, vincent, van, gogh, s, physician, paul, gachet, of, brussels, we, must, drag, the, chain, and, ball, of, our, personality, to, the, end, this, is, the, price, one, pays, for, the, infernal, and, divine, privilege, of, thought, so, in, this, life, it, is, only, the, chosen, who, are, convicts, a, glorious, band, which, understands, and, groans, but, which, treads, the, earth, amidst, a, multitude, of, phantoms, with, maniacal, gestures, and, idiotic, grimaces, which, would, you, rather, be, idiot, or, convict, conrad, wrote, h, g, wells, that, the, latter, s, 1901, book, anticipations, an, ambitious, attempt, to, predict, major, social, trends, seems, to, presuppose, a, sort, of, select, circle, to, which, you, address, yourself, leaving, the, rest, of, the, world, outside, the, pale, you, do, not, take, sufficient, account, of, human, imbecility, which, is, cunning, and, perfidious, in, a, 23, october, 1922, letter, to, mathematician, philosopher, bertrand, russell, in, response, to, the, latter, s, book, the, problem, of, china, which, advocated, socialist, reforms, and, an, oligarchy, of, sages, who, would, reshape, chinese, society, conrad, explained, his, own, distrust, of, political, panaceas, i, have, never, in, any, man, s, book, or, talk, anything, to, stand, up, against, my, deep, seated, sense, of, fatality, governing, this, man, inhabited, world, the, only, remedy, for, chinamen, and, for, the, rest, of, us, is, change, of, hearts, but, looking, at, the, history, of, the, last, 2000, years, there, is, not, much, reason, to, expect, even, if, man, has, taken, to, flying, a, great, uplift, no, doubt, but, no, great, change, leo, robson, writes, conrad, adopted, a, broader, ironic, stance, a, sort, of, blanket, incredulity, defined, by, a, character, in, under, western, eyes, as, the, negation, of, all, faith, devotion, and, action, through, control, of, tone, and, narrative, detail, conrad, exposes, what, he, considered, to, be, the, na, vet, of, movements, like, anarchism, and, socialism, and, the, self, serving, logic, of, such, historical, but, naturalized, phenomena, as, capitalism, piracy, with, good, pr, rationalism, an, elaborate, defense, against, our, innate, irrationality, and, imperialism, a, grandiose, front, for, old, school, rape, and, pillage, to, be, ironic, is, to, be, awake, and, alert, to, the, prevailing, somnolence, in, nostromo, the, journalist, martin, decoud, ridicul, the, idea, that, people, believe, themselves, to, be, influencing, the, fate, of, the, universe, h, g, wells, recalled, conrad, s, astonishment, that, i, could, take, social, and, political, issues, seriously, but, writes, robson, conrad, is, no, moral, nihilist, if, irony, exists, to, suggest, that, there, s, more, to, things, than, meets, the, eye, conrad, further, insists, that, when, we, pay, close, enough, attention, the, more, can, be, endless, he, doesn, t, reject, what, marlow, calls, the, haggard, utilitarian, lies, of, our, civilisation, in, favor, of, nothing, he, rejects, them, in, favor, of, something, some, saving, truth, some, exorcism, against, the, ghost, of, doubt, an, intimation, of, a, deeper, order, one, not, easily, reduced, to, words, authentic, self, aware, emotion, feeling, that, doesn, t, call, itself, theory, or, wisdom, becomes, a, kind, of, standard, bearer, with, impressions, or, sensations, the, nearest, you, get, to, solid, proof, in, an, august, 1901, letter, to, the, editor, of, the, new, york, times, saturday, book, review, conrad, wrote, egoism, which, is, the, moving, force, of, the, world, and, altruism, which, is, its, morality, these, two, contradictory, instincts, of, which, one, is, so, plain, and, the, other, so, mysterious, cannot, serve, us, unless, in, the, incomprehensible, alliance, of, their, irreconcilable, antagonism, on, 3, august, 1924, conrad, died, at, his, house, oswalds, in, bishopsbourne, kent, england, probably, of, a, heart, attack, he, was, interred, at, canterbury, cemetery, canterbury, under, a, misspelled, version, of, his, original, polish, name, as, joseph, teador, conrad, korzeniowski, inscribed, on, his, gravestone, are, the, lines, from, edmund, spenser, s, the, faerie, queene, which, he, had, chosen, as, the, epigraph, to, his, last, complete, novel, the, rover, sleep, after, toyle, port, after, stormie, seas, ease, after, warre, death, after, life, doth, greatly, please, conrad, s, modest, funeral, took, place, amid, great, crowds, his, old, friend, edward, garnett, recalled, bitterly, to, those, who, attended, conrad, s, funeral, in, canterbury, during, the, cricket, festival, of, 1924, and, drove, through, the, crowded, streets, festooned, with, flags, there, was, something, symbolical, in, england, s, hospitality, and, in, the, crowd, s, ignorance, of, even, the, existence, of, this, great, writer, a, few, old, friends, acquaintances, and, pressmen, stood, by, his, grave, another, old, friend, of, conrad, s, cunninghame, graham, wrote, garnett, aubry, was, saying, to, me, that, had, anatole, france, died, all, paris, would, have, been, at, his, funeral, conrad, s, wife, jessie, died, twelve, years, later, on, 6, december, 1936, and, was, interred, with, him, in, 1996, his, grave, was, designated, a, grade, ii, listed, structure, despite, the, opinions, even, of, some, who, knew, conrad, personally, such, as, fellow, novelist, henry, james, conrad, even, when, only, writing, elegantly, crafted, letters, to, his, uncle, and, acquaintances, was, always, at, heart, a, writer, who, sailed, rather, than, a, sailor, who, wrote, he, used, his, sailing, experiences, as, a, backdrop, for, many, of, his, works, but, he, also, produced, works, of, similar, world, view, without, the, nautical, motifs, the, failure, of, many, critics, to, appreciate, this, caused, him, much, frustration, he, wrote, more, often, about, life, at, sea, and, in, exotic, parts, than, about, life, on, british, land, because, unlike, for, example, his, friend, john, galsworthy, author, of, the, forsyte, saga, he, knew, little, about, everyday, domestic, relations, in, britain, when, conrad, s, the, mirror, of, the, sea, was, published, in, 1906, to, critical, acclaim, he, wrote, to, his, french, translator, the, critics, have, been, vigorously, swinging, the, censer, to, me, behind, the, concert, of, flattery, i, can, hear, something, like, a, whisper, keep, to, the, open, sea, don, t, land, they, want, to, banish, me, to, the, middle, of, the, ocean, writing, to, his, friend, richard, curle, conrad, remarked, that, the, public, mind, fastens, on, externals, such, as, his, sea, life, oblivious, to, how, authors, transform, their, material, from, particular, to, general, and, appeal, to, universal, emotions, by, the, temperamental, handling, of, personal, experience, nevertheless, conrad, found, much, sympathetic, readership, especially, in, the, united, states, h, l, mencken, was, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, influential, american, readers, to, recognise, how, conrad, conjured, up, the, general, out, of, the, particular, f, scott, fitzgerald, writing, to, mencken, complained, about, having, been, omitted, from, a, list, of, conrad, imitators, since, fitzgerald, dozens, of, other, american, writers, have, acknowledged, their, debts, to, conrad, including, william, faulkner, william, burroughs, saul, bellow, philip, roth, joan, didion, and, thomas, pynchon, an, october, 1923, visitor, to, oswalds, conrad, s, home, at, the, time, cyril, clemens, a, cousin, of, mark, twain, quoted, conrad, as, saying, in, everything, i, have, written, there, is, always, one, invariable, intention, and, that, is, to, capture, the, reader, s, attention, conrad, the, artist, famously, aspired, in, the, words, of, his, preface, to, the, nigger, of, the, narcissus, 1897, by, the, power, of, the, written, word, to, make, you, hear, to, make, you, feel, before, all, to, make, you, see, that, and, no, more, and, it, is, everything, if, i, succeed, you, shall, find, there, according, to, your, deserts, encouragement, consolation, fear, charm, all, you, demand, and, perhaps, also, that, glimpse, of, truth, for, which, you, have, forgotten, to, ask, writing, in, what, to, the, visual, arts, was, the, age, of, impressionism, and, what, to, music, was, the, age, of, impressionist, music, conrad, showed, himself, in, many, of, his, works, a, prose, poet, of, the, highest, order, for, instance, in, the, evocative, patna, and, courtroom, scenes, of, lord, jim, in, the, scenes, of, the, melancholy, mad, elephant, and, the, french, gunboat, firing, into, a, continent, in, heart, of, darkness, in, the, doubled, protagonists, of, the, secret, sharer, and, in, the, verbal, and, conceptual, resonances, of, nostromo, and, the, nigger, of, the, narcissus, conrad, used, his, own, memories, as, literary, material, so, often, that, readers, are, tempted, to, treat, his, life, and, work, as, a, single, whole, his, view, of, the, world, or, elements, of, it, is, often, described, by, citing, at, once, both, his, private, and, public, statements, passages, from, his, letters, and, citations, from, his, books, najder, warns, that, this, approach, produces, an, incoherent, and, misleading, picture, an, uncritical, linking, of, the, two, spheres, literature, and, private, life, distorts, each, conrad, used, his, own, experiences, as, raw, material, but, the, finished, product, should, not, be, confused, with, the, experiences, themselves, many, of, conrad, s, characters, were, inspired, by, actual, persons, he, had, met, including, in, his, first, novel, almayer, s, folly, completed, 1894, william, charles, olmeijer, the, spelling, of, whose, surname, conrad, probably, altered, to, almayer, inadvertently, the, historic, trader, olmeijer, whom, conrad, encountered, on, his, four, short, visits, to, berau, in, borneo, subsequently, haunted, conrad, s, imagination, conrad, often, borrowed, the, authentic, names, of, actual, individuals, e, g, captain, mcwhirr, typhoon, captain, beard, and, mr, mahon, youth, captain, lingard, almayer, s, folly, and, elsewhere, and, captain, ellis, the, shadow, line, conrad, writes, j, i, m, stewart, appears, to, have, attached, some, mysterious, significance, to, such, links, with, actuality, equally, curious, is, a, great, deal, of, namelessness, in, conrad, requiring, some, minor, virtuosity, to, maintain, thus, we, never, learn, the, surname, of, the, protagonist, of, lord, jim, conrad, also, preserves, in, the, nigger, of, the, narcissus, the, authentic, name, of, the, ship, the, narcissus, in, which, he, sailed, in, 1884, apart, from, conrad, s, own, experiences, a, number, of, episodes, in, his, fiction, were, suggested, by, past, or, contemporary, publicly, known, events, or, literary, works, the, first, half, of, the, 1900, novel, lord, jim, the, patna, episode, was, inspired, by, the, real, life, 1880, story, of, the, ss, jeddah, the, second, part, to, some, extent, by, the, life, of, james, brooke, the, first, white, rajah, of, sarawak, the, 1901, short, story, amy, foster, was, inspired, partly, by, an, anecdote, in, ford, madox, ford, s, the, cinque, ports, 1900, wherein, a, shipwrecked, sailor, from, a, german, merchant, ship, unable, to, communicate, in, english, and, driven, away, by, the, local, country, people, finally, found, shelter, in, a, pigsty, in, nostromo, completed, 1904, the, theft, of, a, massive, consignment, of, silver, was, suggested, to, conrad, by, a, story, he, had, heard, in, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, later, read, about, in, a, volume, picked, up, outside, a, second, hand, bookshop, the, novel, s, political, strand, according, to, maya, jasanoff, is, related, to, the, creation, of, the, panama, canal, in, january, 1903, she, writes, just, as, conrad, started, writing, nostromo, the, us, and, colombian, secretaries, of, state, signed, a, treaty, granting, the, united, states, a, one, hundred, year, renewable, lease, on, a, six, mile, strip, flanking, the, canal, while, the, papers, murmured, about, revolution, in, colombia, conrad, opened, a, fresh, section, of, nostromo, with, hints, of, dissent, in, costaguana, his, fictional, south, american, country, he, plotted, a, revolution, in, the, costaguanan, fictional, port, of, sulaco, that, mirrored, the, real, life, secessionist, movement, brewing, in, panama, when, conrad, finished, the, novel, on, 1, september, 1904, writes, jasanoff, he, left, sulaco, in, the, condition, of, panama, as, panama, had, gotten, its, independence, instantly, recognized, by, the,

was, keenly, conscious, of, tragedy, in, the, world, and, in, his, works, in, 1898, at, the, start, of, his, writing, career, he, had, written, to, his, scottish, writer, politician, friend, cunninghame, graham, what, makes, mankind, tragic, is, not, that, they, are, the, victims, of, nature, it, is, that, they, are, conscious, of, it, s, soon, as, you, know, of, your, slavery, the, pain, the, anger, the, strife, the, tragedy, begins, but, in, 1922, near, the, end, of, his, life, and, career, when, another, scottish, friend, richard, curle, sent, conrad, proofs, of, two, articles, he, had, written, about, conrad, the, latter, objected, to, being, characterised, as, a, gloomy, and, tragic, writer, that, reputation, has, deprived, me, of, innumerable, readers, i, absolutely, object, to, being, called, a, tragedian, conrad, claimed, that, he, never, kept, a, diary, and, never, owned, a, notebook, john, galsworthy, who, knew, him, well, described, this, as, a, statement, which, surprised, no, one, who, knew, the, resources, of, his, memory, and, the, brooding, nature, of, his, creative, spirit, nevertheless, after, conrad, s, death, richard, curle, published, a, heavily, modified, version, of, conrad, s, diaries, describing, his, experiences, in, the, congo, in, 1978, a, more, complete, version, was, published, as, the, congo, diary, and, other, uncollected, pieces, the, first, accurate, transcription, was, published, in, robert, hampson, s, penguin, edition, of, heart, of, darkness, in, 1995, hampson, s, transcription, and, annotations, were, reprinted, in, the, penguin, edition, of, 2007, unlike, many, authors, who, make, it, a, point, not, to, discuss, work, in, progress, conrad, often, did, discuss, his, current, work, and, even, showed, it, to, select, friends, and, fellow, authors, such, as, edward, garnett, and, sometimes, modified, it, in, the, light, of, their, critiques, and, suggestions, edward, said, was, struck, by, the, sheer, quantity, of, conrad, s, correspondence, with, friends, and, fellow, writers, by, 1966, it, amount, to, eight, published, volumes, said, comments, t, seemed, to, me, that, if, conrad, wrote, of, himself, of, the, problem, of, self, definition, with, such, sustained, urgency, some, of, what, he, wrote, must, have, had, meaning, for, his, fiction, t, difficult, to, believe, that, a, man, would, be, so, uneconomical, as, to, pour, himself, out, in, letter, after, letter, and, then, not, use, and, reformulate, his, insights, and, discoveries, in, his, fiction, said, found, especially, close, parallels, between, conrad, s, letters, and, his, shorter, fiction, conrad, believed, that, artistic, distinction, was, more, tellingly, demonstrated, in, a, shorter, rather, than, a, longer, work, he, believed, that, his, life, was, like, a, series, of, short, episodes, because, he, was, himself, so, many, different, people, he, was, a, pole, and, an, englishman, a, sailor, and, a, writer, another, scholar, najder, wrote, throughout, almost, his, entire, life, conrad, was, an, outsider, and, felt, himself, to, be, one, an, outsider, in, exile, an, outsider, during, his, visits, to, his, family, in, the, ukraine, an, outsider, because, of, his, experiences, and, bereavement, in, and, lw, w, an, outsider, in, marseilles, an, outsider, nationally, and, culturally, on, british, ships, an, outsider, as, an, english, writer, conrad, called, himself, to, graham, a, bloody, foreigner, at, the, same, time, e, regarded, the, national, spirit, as, the, only, truly, permanent, and, reliable, element, of, communal, life, conrad, borrowed, from, other, polish, and, french, language, authors, to, an, extent, sometimes, skirting, plagiarism, when, the, polish, translation, of, his, 1915, novel, victory, appeared, in, 1931, readers, noted, striking, similarities, to, stefan, eromski, s, kitschy, novel, the, history, of, a, sin, dzieje, grzechu, 1908, including, their, endings, comparative, literature, scholar, yves, hervouet, has, demonstrated, in, the, text, of, victory, a, whole, mosaic, of, influences, borrowings, similarities, and, allusions, he, further, lists, hundreds, of, concrete, borrowings, from, other, mostly, french, authors, in, nearly, all, of, conrad, s, works, from, almayer, s, folly, 1895, to, his, unfinished, suspense, conrad, seems, to, have, used, eminent, writers, texts, as, raw, material, of, the, same, kind, as, the, content, of, his, own, memory, materials, borrowed, from, other, authors, often, functioned, as, allusions, moreover, he, had, a, phenomenal, memory, for, texts, and, remembered, details, but, it, was, not, a, memory, strictly, categorized, according, to, sources, marshalled, into, homogeneous, entities, it, was, rather, an, enormous, receptacle, of, images, and, pieces, from, which, he, would, draw, continues, najder, e, can, never, be, accused, of, outright, plagiarism, even, when, lifting, sentences, and, scenes, conrad, changed, their, character, inserted, them, within, novel, structures, he, did, not, imitate, but, as, hervouet, says, continued, his, masters, he, was, right, in, saying, i, don, t, resemble, anybody, ian, watt, put, it, succinctly, in, a, sense, conrad, is, the, least, derivative, of, writers, he, wrote, very, little, that, could, possibly, be, mistaken, for, the, work, of, anyone, else, conrad, s, acquaintance, george, bernard, shaw, says, it, well, man, can, no, more, be, completely, original, than, a, tree, can, grow, out, of, air, conrad, like, other, artists, faced, constraints, arising, from, the, need, to, propitiate, his, audience, and, confirm, their, own, favourable, self, regard, this, may, account, for, his, describing, the, admirable, crew, of, the, judea, in, his, 1898, story, youth, as, liverpool, hard, cases, whereas, the, crew, of, the, judea, s, actual, 1882, prototype, the, palestine, had, included, not, a, single, liverpudlian, and, half, the, crew, had, been, non, britons, and, for, conrad, s, transforming, the, real, life, 1880, criminally, negligent, british, captain, j, l, clark, of, the, ss, jeddah, in, his, 1900, novel, lord, jim, into, the, captain, of, the, fictitious, patna, a, sort, of, renegade, new, south, wales, german, so, monstrous, in, physical, appearance, as, to, suggest, a, trained, baby, elephant, similarly, in, his, letters, conrad, during, most, of, his, literary, career, struggling, for, sheer, financial, survival, often, adjusted, his, views, to, the, predilections, of, his, correspondents, historians, have, also, noted, that, conrad, s, works, which, were, set, in, european, colonies, and, intended, to, critique, the, effects, of, colonialism, were, set, in, dutch, and, belgian, colonies, instead, of, the, british, empire, the, singularity, of, the, universe, depicted, in, conrad, s, novels, especially, compared, to, those, of, near, contemporaries, like, his, friend, and, frequent, benefactor, john, galsworthy, is, such, as, to, open, him, to, criticism, similar, to, that, later, applied, to, graham, greene, but, where, greeneland, has, been, characterised, as, a, recurring, and, recognisable, atmosphere, independent, of, setting, conrad, is, at, pains, to, create, a, sense, of, place, be, it, aboard, ship, or, in, a, remote, village, often, he, chose, to, have, his, characters, play, out, their, destinies, in, isolated, or, confined, circumstances, in, the, view, of, evelyn, waugh, and, kingsley, amis, it, was, not, until, the, first, volumes, of, anthony, powell, s, sequence, a, dance, to, the, music, of, time, were, published, in, the, 1950s, that, an, english, novelist, achieved, the, same, command, of, atmosphere, and, precision, of, language, with, consistency, a, view, supported, by, later, critics, like, a, n, wilson, powell, acknowledged, his, debt, to, conrad, leo, gurko, too, remarks, as, one, of, conrad, s, special, qualities, his, abnormal, awareness, of, place, an, awareness, magnified, to, almost, a, new, dimension, in, art, an, ecological, dimension, defining, the, relationship, between, earth, and, man, t, e, lawrence, one, of, many, writers, whom, conrad, befriended, offered, some, perceptive, observations, about, conrad, s, writing, he, s, absolutely, the, most, haunting, thing, in, prose, that, ever, was, i, wish, i, knew, how, every, paragraph, he, writes, they, are, all, paragraphs, he, seldom, writes, a, single, sentence, goes, on, sounding, in, waves, like, the, note, of, a, tenor, bell, after, it, stops, it, s, not, built, in, the, rhythm, of, ordinary, prose, but, on, something, existing, only, in, his, head, and, as, he, can, never, say, what, it, is, he, wants, to, say, all, his, things, end, in, a, kind, of, hunger, a, suggestion, of, something, he, can, t, say, or, do, or, think, so, his, books, always, look, bigger, than, they, are, he, s, as, much, a, giant, of, the, subjective, as, kipling, is, of, the, objective, do, they, hate, one, another, the, irish, novelist, poet, critic, colm, t, ib, n, captures, something, similar, joseph, conrad, s, heroes, were, often, alone, and, close, to, hostility, and, danger, sometimes, when, conrad, s, imagination, was, at, its, most, fertile, and, his, command, of, english, at, its, most, precise, the, danger, came, darkly, from, within, the, self, at, other, times, however, it, came, from, what, could, not, be, named, conrad, sought, then, to, evoke, rather, than, delineate, using, something, close, to, the, language, of, prayer, while, his, imagination, was, content, at, times, with, the, tiny, vivid, perfectly, observed, detail, it, was, also, nourished, by, the, need, to, suggest, and, symbolize, like, a, poet, he, often, left, the, space, in, between, strangely, alluringly, vacant, his, own, vague, terms, words, like, ineffable, infinite, mysterious, unknowable, were, as, close, as, he, could, come, to, a, sense, of, our, fate, in, the, world, or, the, essence, of, the, universe, a, sense, that, reached, beyond, the, time, he, described, and, beyond, his, characters, circumstances, this, idea, of, beyond, satisfied, something, in, his, imagination, he, worked, as, though, between, the, intricate, systems, of, a, ship, and, the, vague, horizon, of, a, vast, sea, this, irreconcilable, distance, between, what, was, precise, and, what, was, shimmering, made, him, much, more, than, a, novelist, of, adventure, a, chronicler, of, the, issues, that, haunted, his, time, or, a, writer, who, dramatized, moral, questions, this, left, him, open, to, interpretation, and, indeed, to, attack, in, a, letter, of, 14, december, 1897, to, his, scottish, friend, robert, bontine, cunninghame, graham, conrad, wrote, that, science, tells, us, understand, that, thou, art, nothing, less, than, a, shadow, more, insignificant, than, a, drop, of, water, in, the, ocean, more, fleeting, than, the, illusion, of, a, dream, in, a, letter, of, 20, december, 1897, to, cunninghame, graham, conrad, metaphorically, described, the, universe, as, a, huge, machine, it, evolved, itself, i, am, severely, scientific, out, of, a, chaos, of, scraps, of, iron, and, behold, it, knits, i, am, horrified, at, the, horrible, work, and, stand, appalled, i, feel, it, ought, to, embroider, but, it, goes, on, knitting, you, come, and, say, this, is, all, right, it, s, only, a, question, of, the, right, kind, of, oil, let, us, use, this, for, instance, celestial, oil, and, the, machine, shall, embroider, a, most, beautiful, design, in, purple, and, gold, will, it, alas, no, you, cannot, by, any, special, lubrication, make, embroidery, with, a, knitting, machine, and, the, most, withering, thought, is, that, the, infamous, thing, has, made, itself, made, itself, without, thought, without, conscience, without, foresight, without, eyes, without, heart, it, is, a, tragic, accident, and, it, has, happened, you, can, t, interfere, with, it, the, last, drop, of, bitterness, is, in, the, suspicion, that, you, can, t, even, smash, it, in, virtue, of, that, truth, one, and, immortal, which, lurks, in, the, force, that, made, it, spring, into, existence, it, is, what, it, is, and, it, is, indestructible, it, knits, us, in, and, it, knits, us, out, it, has, knitted, time, space, pain, death, corruption, despair, and, all, the, illusions, and, nothing, matters, conrad, wrote, cunninghame, graham, on, 31, january, 1898, faith, is, a, myth, and, beliefs, shift, like, mists, on, the, shore, thoughts, vanish, words, once, pronounced, die, and, the, memory, of, yesterday, is, as, shadowy, as, the, hope, of, to, morrow, in, this, world, as, i, have, known, it, we, are, made, to, suffer, without, the, shadow, of, a, reason, of, a, cause, or, of, guilt, there, is, no, morality, no, knowledge, and, no, hope, there, is, only, the, consciousness, of, ourselves, which, drives, us, about, a, world, that, is, always, but, a, vain, and, fleeting, appearance, a, moment, a, twinkling, of, an, eye, and, nothing, remains, but, a, clod, of, mud, of, cold, mud, of, dead, mud, cast, into, black, space, rolling, around, an, extinguished, sun, nothing, neither, thought, nor, sound, nor, soul, nothing, leo, robson, suggests, that, what, really, learned, as, a, sailor, was, not, something, empirical, an, assembly, of, places, and, events, but, the, vindication, of, a, perspective, he, had, developed, in, childhood, an, impartial, unillusioned, view, of, the, world, as, a, place, of, mystery, and, contingency, horror, and, splendor, where, as, he, put, it, in, a, letter, to, the, london, times, the, only, indisputable, truth, is, our, ignorance, according, to, robson, treatment, of, knowledge, as, contingent, and, provisional, commands, a, range, of, comparisons, from, rashomon, to, richard, rorty, reference, points, for, conrad, s, fragmentary, method, include, picasso, and, t, s, eliot, who, took, the, epigraph, of, the, hollow, men, from, heart, of, darkness, even, henry, james, s, late, period, that, other, harbinger, of, the, modernist, novel, had, not, yet, begun, when, conrad, invented, marlow, and, james, s, earlier, experiments, in, perspective, the, spoils, of, poynton, what, maisie, knew, don, t, go, nearly, as, far, as, lord, jim, conrad, spoke, his, native, polish, and, the, french, language, fluently, from, childhood, and, only, acquired, english, in, his, twenties, he, would, probably, have, spoken, some, ukrainian, as, a, child, he, certainly, had, to, have, some, knowledge, of, german, and, russian, his, son, borys, records, that, though, conrad, had, insisted, that, he, spoke, only, a, few, words, of, german, when, they, reached, the, austrian, frontier, in, the, family, s, attempt, to, leave, poland, in, 1914, conrad, spoke, german, at, considerable, length, and, extreme, fluency, russia, prussia, and, austria, had, divided, up, poland, among, them, and, he, was, officially, a, russian, subject, until, his, naturalization, as, a, british, subject, as, a, result, up, to, this, point, his, official, documents, were, in, russian, his, knowledge, of, russian, was, good, enough, that, his, uncle, tadeusz, bobrowski, wrote, him, 22, may, 1893, advising, that, when, conrad, came, to, visit, he, should, telegraph, for, horses, but, in, russian, for, orat, w, doesn, t, receive, or, accept, messages, in, an, alien, language, conrad, chose, however, to, write, his, fiction, in, english, he, says, in, his, preface, to, a, personal, record, that, writing, in, english, was, for, him, natural, and, that, the, idea, of, his, having, made, a, deliberate, choice, between, english, and, french, as, some, had, suggested, was, in, error, he, explained, that, though, he, had, been, familiar, with, french, from, childhood, i, would, have, been, afraid, to, attempt, expression, in, a, language, so, perfectly, crystallized, in, 1915, as, jo, davidson, sculpted, his, bust, conrad, answered, his, question, ah, to, write, french, you, have, to, know, it, english, is, so, plastic, if, you, haven, t, got, a, word, you, need, you, can, make, it, but, to, write, french, you, have, to, be, an, artist, like, anatole, france, these, statements, as, so, often, in, conrad, s, autobiographical, writings, are, subtly, disingenuous, in, 1897, conrad, was, visited, by, a, fellow, pole, the, philosopher, wincenty, lutos, awski, who, asked, conrad, why, don, t, you, write, in, polish, lutos, awski, recalled, conrad, explaining, i, value, our, beautiful, polish, literature, too, much, to, bring, into, it, my, clumsy, efforts, but, for, the, english, my, gifts, are, sufficient, and, secure, my, daily, bread, conrad, wrote, in, a, personal, record, that, english, was, the, speech, of, my, secret, choice, of, my, future, of, long, friendships, of, the, deepest, affections, of, hours, of, toil, and, hours, of, ease, and, of, solitary, hours, too, of, books, read, of, thoughts, pursued, of, remembered, emotions, of, my, very, dreams, in, 1878, conrad, s, four, year, experience, in, the, french, merchant, marine, had, been, cut, short, when, the, french, discovered, he, did, not, have, a, permit, from, the, imperial, russian, consul, to, sail, with, the, french, this, and, some, typically, disastrous, conradian, investments, had, left, him, destitute, and, had, precipitated, a, suicide, attempt, with, the, concurrence, of, his, mentor, uncle, tadeusz, bobrowski, who, had, been, summoned, to, marseilles, conrad, decided, to, seek, employment, with, the, british, merchant, marine, which, did, not, require, russia, s, permission, thus, began, conrad, s, sixteen, years, seafarer, s, acquaintance, with, the, british, and, with, the, english, language, had, conrad, remained, in, the, francophone, sphere, or, had, he, returned, to, poland, the, son, of, the, polish, poet, playwright, and, translator, apollo, korzeniowski, from, childhood, exposed, to, polish, and, foreign, literature, and, ambitious, to, himself, become, a, writer, he, might, have, ended, up, writing, in, french, or, polish, instead, of, english, certainly, his, uncle, tadeusz, thought, conrad, might, write, in, polish, in, an, 1881, letter, he, advised, his, 23, year, old, nephew, as, thank, god, you, do, not, forget, your, polish, and, your, writing, is, not, bad, i, repeat, what, i, have, written, and, said, before, you, would, do, well, to, write, for, w, drowiec, in, warsaw, we, have, few, travelers, and, even, fewer, genuine, correspondents, the, words, of, an, eyewitness, would, be, of, great, interest, and, in, time, would, bring, you, money, it, would, be, an, exercise, in, your, native, tongue, that, thread, which, binds, you, to, your, country, and, countrymen, and, finally, a, tribute, to, the, memory, of, your, father, who, always, wanted, to, and, did, serve, his, country, by, his, pen, in, the, opinion, of, some, biographers, conrad, s, third, language, english, remained, under, the, influence, of, his, first, two, languages, polish, and, french, this, makes, his, english, seem, unusual, najder, writes, that, e, was, a, man, of, three, cultures, polish, french, and, english, brought, up, in, a, polish, family, and, cultural, environment, he, learned, french, as, a, child, and, at, the, age, of, less, than, seventeen, went, to, france, to, serve, four, years, in, the, french, merchant, marine, at, school, he, must, have, learned, german, but, french, remained, the, language, he, spoke, with, greatest, fluency, and, no, foreign, accent, until, the, end, of, his, life, he, was, well, versed, in, french, history, and, literature, and, french, novelists, were, his, artistic, models, but, he, wrote, all, his, books, in, english, the, tongue, he, started, to, learn, at, the, age, of, twenty, he, was, thus, an, english, writer, who, grew, up, in, other, linguistic, and, cultural, environments, his, work, can, be, seen, as, located, in, the, borderland, of, auto, translation, inevitably, for, a, trilingual, polish, french, english, speaker, conrad, s, writings, occasionally, show, linguistic, spillover, franglais, or, poglish, the, inadvertent, use, of, french, or, polish, vocabulary, grammar, or, syntax, in, his, english, writings, in, one, instance, najder, used, several, slips, in, vocabulary, typical, for, conrad, gallicisms, and, grammar, usually, polonisms, as, part, of, internal, evidence, against, conrad, s, sometime, literary, collaborator, ford, madox, ford, s, claim, to, have, written, a, certain, instalment, of, conrad, s, novel, nostromo, for, publication, in, t, p, s, weekly, on, behalf, of, an, ill, conrad, the, impracticality, of, working, with, a, language, which, has, long, ceased, to, be, one, s, principal, language, of, daily, use, is, illustrated, by, conrad, s, 1921, attempt, at, translating, into, english, the, polish, physicist, columnist, story, writer, and, comedy, writer, bruno, winawer, s, short, play, the, book, of, job, najder, writes, he, language, is, easy, colloquial, slightly, individualized, particularly, herup, and, a, snobbish, jew, bolo, bendziner, have, their, characteristic, ways, of, speaking, conrad, who, had, had, little, contact, with, everyday, spoken, polish, simplified, the, dialogue, left, out, herup, s, scientific, expressions, and, missed, many, amusing, nuances, the, action, in, the, original, is, quite, clearly, set, in, contemporary, warsaw, somewhere, between, elegant, society, and, the, demimonde, this, specific, cultural, setting, is, lost, in, the, translation, conrad, left, out, many, accents, of, topical, satire, in, the, presentation, of, the, dramatis, personae, and, ignored, not, only, the, ungrammatical, speech, which, might, have, escaped, him, of, some, characters, but, even, the, jewishness, of, two, of, them, bolo, and, mosan, as, a, practical, matter, by, the, time, conrad, set, about, writing, fiction, he, had, little, choice, but, to, write, in, english, poles, who, accused, conrad, of, cultural, apostasy, because, he, wrote, in, english, instead, of, polish, missed, the, point, as, do, anglophones, who, see, in, conrad, s, default, choice, of, english, as, his, artistic, medium, a, testimonial, to, some, sort, of, innate, superiority, of, the, english, language, according, to, conrad, s, close, friend, and, literary, assistant, richard, curle, the, fact, of, conrad, writing, in, english, was, obviously, misleading, because, conrad, is, no, more, completely, english, in, his, art, than, he, is, in, his, nationality, conrad, according, to, curle, could, never, have, written, in, any, other, language, save, the, english, language, for, he, would, have, been, dumb, in, any, other, language, but, the, english, conrad, always, retained, a, strong, emotional, attachment, to, his, native, language, he, asked, his, visiting, polish, niece, karola, zag, rska, will, you, forgive, me, that, my, sons, don, t, speak, polish, in, june, 1924, shortly, before, his, death, he, apparently, expressed, a, desire, that, his, son, john, marry, a, polish, girl, and, learn, polish, and, toyed, with, the, idea, of, returning, for, good, to, now, independent, poland, conrad, bridled, at, being, referred, to, as, a, russian, or, slavonic, writer, the, only, russian, writer, he, admired, was, ivan, turgenev, the, critics, he, wrote, an, acquaintance, on, 31, january, 1924, six, months, before, his, death, detected, in, me, a, new, note, and, as, just, when, i, began, to, write, they, had, discovered, the, existence, of, russian, authors, they, stuck, that, label, on, me, under, the, name, of, slavonism, what, i, venture, to, say, is, that, it, would, have, been, more, just, to, charge, me, at, most, with, polonism, however, though, conrad, protested, that, dostoyevsky, was, too, russian, for, me, and, that, russian, literature, generally, was, repugnant, to, me, hereditarily, and, individually, under, western, eyes, is, viewed, as, conrad, s, response, to, the, themes, explored, in, dostoyevsky, s, crime, and, punishment, conrad, had, an, awareness, that, in, any, language, individual, expressions, words, phrases, sentences, are, fraught, with, connotations, he, once, wrote, no, english, word, has, clean, edges, all, expressions, he, thought, carried, so, many, connotations, as, to, be, little, more, than, instruments, for, exciting, blurred, emotions, this, might, help, elucidate, the, impressionistic, quality, of, many, passages, in, his, writings, it, also, explains, why, he, chose, to, write, his, literary, works, not, in, polish, or, french, but, in, english, with, which, for, decades, he, had, had, the, greatest, contact, in, 1975, the, nigerian, writer, chinua, achebe, published, an, essay, an, image, of, africa, racism, in, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, which, provoked, controversy, by, calling, conrad, a, thoroughgoing, racist, achebe, s, view, was, that, heart, of, darkness, cannot, be, considered, a, great, work, of, art, because, it, is, a, novel, which, celebrates, dehumanisation, which, depersonalises, a, portion, of, the, human, race, referring, to, conrad, as, a, talented, tormented, man, achebe, notes, that, conrad, via, the, protagonist, charles, marlow, reduces, and, degrades, africans, to, limbs, ankles, glistening, white, eyeballs, etc, while, simultaneously, and, fearfully, suspecting, a, common, kinship, between, himself, and, these, natives, leading, marlow, to, sneer, the, word, ugly, achebe, also, cited, conrad, s, description, of, an, encounter, with, an, african, a, certain, enormous, buck, nigger, encountered, in, haiti, fixed, my, conception, of, blind, furious, unreasoning, rage, as, manifested, in, the, human, animal, to, the, end, of, my, days, achebe, s, essay, a, landmark, in, postcolonial, discourse, provoked, debate, and, the, questions, it, raised, have, been, addressed, in, most, subsequent, literary, criticism, of, conrad, achebe, s, critics, argue, that, he, fails, to, distinguish, marlow, s, view, from, conrad, s, which, results, in, very, clumsy, interpretations, of, the, novella, in, their, view, conrad, portrays, africans, sympathetically, and, their, plight, tragically, and, refers, sarcastically, to, and, condemns, outright, the, supposedly, noble, aims, of, european, colonists, thereby, demonstrating, his, skepticism, about, the, moral, superiority, of, white, men, ending, a, passage, that, describes, the, condition, of, chained, emaciated, slaves, the, novelist, remarks, after, all, i, also, was, a, part, of, the, great, cause, of, these, high, and, just, proceedings, some, observers, assert, that, conrad, whose, native, country, had, been, conquered, by, imperial, powers, empathised, by, default, with, other, subjugated, peoples, jeffrey, meyers, notes, that, conrad, like, his, acquaintance, roger, casement, was, one, of, the, first, men, to, question, the, western, notion, of, progress, a, dominant, idea, in, europe, from, the, renaissance, to, the, great, war, to, attack, the, hypocritical, justification, of, colonialism, and, to, reveal, the, savage, degradation, of, the, white, man, in, africa, likewise, e, d, morel, who, led, international, opposition, to, king, leopold, ii, s, rule, in, the, congo, saw, conrad, s, heart, of, darkness, as, a, condemnation, of, colonial, brutality, and, referred, to, the, novella, as, the, most, powerful, thing, written, on, the, subject, more, recently, nidesh, lawtoo, complicated, the, race, debate, by, showing, that, conrad, s, images, of, frenzy, depict, rituals, of, possession, trance, that, are, equally, central, to, achebe, s, things, fall, apart, conrad, scholar, peter, firchow, writes, that, nowhere, in, the, novel, does, conrad, or, any, of, his, narrators, personified, or, otherwise, claim, superiority, on, the, part, of, europeans, on, the, grounds, of, alleged, genetic, or, biological, difference, if, conrad, or, his, novel, is, racist, it, is, only, in, a, weak, sense, since, heart, of, darkness, acknowledges, racial, distinctions, but, does, not, suggest, an, essential, superiority, of, any, group, achebe, s, reading, of, heart, of, darkness, can, be, and, has, been, challenged, by, a, reading, of, conrad, s, other, african, story, an, outpost, of, progress, which, has, an, omniscient, narrator, rather, than, the, embodied, narrator, marlow, some, younger, scholars, such, as, masood, ashraf, raja, have, also, suggested, that, if, we, read, conrad, beyond, heart, of, darkness, especially, his, malay, novels, racism, can, be, further, complicated, by, foregrounding, conrad, s, positive, representation, of, muslims, in, 1998, h, s, zins, wrote, in, pula, botswana, journal, of, african, studies, conrad, made, english, literature, more, mature, and, reflective, because, he, called, attention, to, the, sheer, horror, of, political, realities, overlooked, by, english, citizens, and, politicians, the, case, of, poland, his, oppressed, homeland, was, one, such, issue, the, colonial, exploitation, of, africans, was, another, his, condemnation, of, imperialism, and, colonialism, combined, with, sympathy, for, its, persecuted, and, suffering, victims, was, drawn, from, his, polish, background, his, own, personal, sufferings, and, the, experience, of, a, persecuted, people, living, under, foreign, occupation, personal, memories, created, in, him, a, great, sensitivity, for, human, degradation, and, a, sense, of, moral, responsibility, adam, hochschild, makes, a, similar, point, what, gave, such, a, rare, ability, to, see, the, arrogance, and, theft, at, the, heart, of, imperialism, much, of, it, surely, had, to, do, with, the, fact, that, he, himself, as, a, pole, knew, what, it, was, like, to, live, in, conquered, territory, or, the, first, few, years, of, his, life, tens, of, millions, of, peasants, in, the, russian, empire, were, the, equivalent, of, slave, laborers, serfs, conrad, s, poet, father, apollo, korzeniowski, was, a, polish, nationalist, and, an, opponent, of, serfdom, boy, grew, up, among, exiled, prison, veterans, talk, of, serfdom, and, the, news, of, relatives, killed, in, uprisings, was, ready, to, distrust, imperial, conquerors, who, claimed, they, had, the, right, to, rule, other, peoples, conrad, s, experience, in, the, belgian, run, congo, made, him, one, of, the, fiercest, critics, of, the, white, man, s, mission, it, was, also, writes, najder, conrad, s, most, daring, and, last, attempt, to, become, a, homo, socialis, a, cog, in, the, mechanism, of, society, by, accepting, the, job, in, the, trading, company, he, joined, for, once, in, his, life, an, organized, large, scale, group, activity, on, land, it, is, not, accidental, that, the, congo, expedition, remained, an, isolated, event, in, conrad, s, life, until, his, death, he, remained, a, recluse, in, the, social, sense, and, never, became, involved, with, any, institution, or, clearly, defined, group, of, people, conrad, was, a, russian, subject, having, been, born, in, the, russian, part, of, what, had, once, been, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, after, his, father, s, death, conrad, s, uncle, bobrowski, had, attempted, to, secure, austrian, citizenship, for, him, to, no, avail, probably, because, conrad, had, not, received, permission, from, russian, authorities, to, remain, abroad, permanently, and, had, not, been, released, from, being, a, russian, subject, conrad, could, not, return, to, the, russian, empire, he, would, have, been, liable, to, many, years, of, military, service, and, as, the, son, of, political, exiles, to, harassment, in, a, letter, of, 9, august, 1877, conrad, s, uncle, bobrowski, broached, two, important, subjects, the, desirability, of, conrad, s, naturalisation, abroad, tantamount, to, release, from, being, a, russian, subject, and, conrad, s, plans, to, join, the, british, merchant, marine, o, you, speak, english, i, never, wished, you, to, become, naturalized, in, france, mainly, because, of, the, compulsory, military, service, i, thought, however, of, your, getting, naturalized, in, switzerland, in, his, next, letter, bobrowski, supported, conrad, s, idea, of, seeking, citizenship, of, the, united, states, or, of, one, of, the, more, important, southern, republics, eventually, conrad, would, make, his, home, in, england, on, 2, july, 1886, he, applied, for, british, nationality, which, was, granted, on, 19, august, 1886, yet, in, spite, of, having, become, a, subject, of, queen, victoria, conrad, had, not, ceased, to, be, a, subject, of, tsar, alexander, iii, to, achieve, his, freedom, from, that, subjection, he, had, to, make, many, visits, to, the, russian, embassy, in, london, and, politely, reiterate, his, request, he, would, later, recall, the, embassy, s, home, at, belgrave, square, in, his, novel, the, secret, agent, finally, on, 2, april, 1889, the, russian, ministry, of, home, affairs, released, the, son, of, a, polish, man, of, letters, captain, of, the, british, merchant, marine, from, the, status, of,

official, history, of, the, oriental, hotel, where, he, never, in, fact, stayed, lodging, aboard, his, ship, the, otago, along, with, that, of, a, less, well, behaved, guest, somerset, maugham, who,

closely, in, his, footsteps, sometimes, requesting, the, same, room, and, perpetuating, myths, that, have, no, basis, in, fact, no, caribbean, resort, is, yet, known, to, have, claimed, conrad, s, patronage, although, he, is, believed, to, have, stayed, at, a, fort, de, france, pension, upon, arrival, in, martinique, on, his, first, voyage, in, 1875, when, he, travelled, as, a, passenger, on, the, mont, blanc, in, april, 2013, a, monument, to, conrad, was, unveiled, in, the, russian, town, of, vologda, where, he, and, his, parents, lived, in, exile, in, 1862, 63, the, monument, was, removed, with, unclear, explanation, in, june, 2016, conrad, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, writers, in, the, english, language, after, the, publication, of, chance, in, 1913, he, was, the, subject, of, more, discussion, and, praise, than, any, other, english, writer, of, the, time, he, had, a, genius, for, companionship, and, his, circle, of, friends, which, he, had, begun, assembling, even, prior, to, his, first, publications, included, authors, and, other, leading, lights, in, the, arts, such, as, henry, james, robert, bontine, cunninghame, graham, john, galsworthy, galsworthy, s,

conrad, s, growing, renown, and, prestige, among, writers, and, critics, in, continental, europe, fostered, his, hopes, for, a, nobel, prize, in, literature, it, was, apparently, the, french, and, swedes, not, the, english, who, favoured, conrad, s, candidacy, in, april, 1924, conrad, who, possessed, a, hereditary, polish, status, of, nobility, and, coat, of, arms, na, cz, declined, a, non, hereditary, british, knighthood, offered, by, labour, party, prime, minister, ramsay, macdonald, conrad, kept, a, distance, from, official, structures, he, never, voted, in, british, national, elections, and, seems, to, have, been, averse, to, public, honours, generally, he, had, already, refused, honorary, degrees, from, cambridge, durham, edinburgh, liverpool, and, yale, universities, in, the, polish, people, s, republic, translations, of, conrad, s, works, were, openly, published, except, for, under, western, eyes, which, in, the, 1980s, was, published, as, an, underground, bibu, a, conrad, s, narrative, style, and, anti, heroic, characters, have, influenced, many, authors, including, t, s, eliot, maria, d, browska, f, scott, fitzgerald, william, faulkner, gerald, basil, edwards,

portrait, of, conrad, aged, about, 46, was, drawn, by, the, historian, and, poet, henry, newbolt, who, met, him, about, 1903, one, thing, struck, me, at, once, the, extraordinary, difference, between, his, expression, in, profile, and, when, looked, at, full, face, hile, the, profile, was, aquiline, and, commanding, in, the, front, view, the, broad, brow, wide, apart, eyes, and, full, lips, produced, the, effect, of, an, intellectual, calm, and, even, at, times, of, a, dreaming, philosophy, then, s, we, sat, in, our, little, half, circle, round, the, fire, and, talked, on, anything, and, everything, i, saw, a, third, conrad, emerge, an, artistic, self, sensitive, and, restless, to, the, last, degree, the, more, he, talked, the, more, quickly, he, consumed, his, cigarettes, and, presently, when, i, asked, him, why, he, was, leaving, london, after, only, two, days, he, replied, that, the, crowd, in, the, streets, terrified, him, terrified, by, that, dull, stream, of, obliterated, faces, he, leaned, forward, with, both, hands, raised, and, clenched, yes, terrified, i, see, their, personalities, all, leaping, out, at, me, like, tigers, he, acted, the, tiger, well, enough, almost, to, terrify, his, hearers, but, the, moment, after, he, was, talking, again, wisely, and, soberly, as, if, he, were, an, average, englishman, with, not, an, irritable, nerve, in, his, body, on, 12, october, 1912, american, music, critic, james, huneker, visited, conrad, and, later, recalled, being, received, by, a, man, of, the, world, neither, sailor, nor, novelist, just, a, simple, mannered, gentleman, whose, welcome, was, sincere, whose, glance, was, veiled, at, times, far, away, whose, ways, were, french, polish, anything, but, literary, bluff, or, english, after, respective, separate, visits, to, conrad, in, august, and, september, 1913, two, british, aristocrats, the, socialite, lady, ottoline, morrell, and, the, mathematician, and, philosopher, bertrand, russell, who, were, lovers, at, the, time, recorded, their, impressions, of, the, novelist, in, her, diary, morrell, wrote, i, found, conrad, himself, standing, at, the, door, of, the, house, ready, to, receive, me, appearance, was, really, that, of, a, polish, nobleman, his, manner, was, perfect, almost, too, elaborate, so, nervous, and, sympathetic, that, every, fibre, of, him, seemed, electric, he, talked, english, with, a, strong, accent, as, if, he, tasted, his, words, in, his, mouth, before, pronouncing, them, but, he, talked, extremely, well, though, he, had, always, the, talk, and, manner, of, a, foreigner, he, was, dressed, very, carefully, in, a, blue, double, breasted, jacket, he, talked, apparently, with, great, freedom, about, his, life, more, ease, and, freedom, indeed, than, an, englishman, would, have, allowed, himself, he, spoke, of, the, horrors, of, the, congo, from, the, moral, and, physical, shock, of, which, he, said, he, had, never, recovered, seemed, a, nice, and, good, looking, fat, creature, an, excellent, cook, a, good, and, reposeful, mattress, for, this, hypersensitive, nerve, wracked, man, who, did, not, ask, from, his, wife, high, intelligence, only, an, assuagement, of, life, s, vibrations, he, made, me, feel, so, natural, and, very, much, myself, that, i, was, almost, afraid, of, losing, the, thrill, and, wonder, of, being, there, although, i, was, vibrating, with, intense, excitement, inside, his, eyes, under, their, pent, house, lids, revealed, the, suffering, and, the, intensity, of, his, experiences, when, he, spoke, of, his, work, there, came, over, them, a, sort, of, misty, sensuous, dreamy, look, but, they, seemed, to, hold, deep, down, the, ghosts, of, old, adventures, and, experiences, once, or, twice, there, was, something, in, them, one, almost, suspected, of, being, wicked, but, then, i, believe, whatever, strange, wickedness, would, tempt, this, super, subtle, pole, he, would, be, held, in, restraint, by, an, equally, delicate, sense, of, honour, in, his, talk, he, led, me, along, many, paths, of, his, life, but, i, felt, that, he, did, not, wish, to, explore, the, jungle, of, emotions, that, lay, dense, on, either, side, and, that, his, apparent, frankness, had, a, great, reserve, a, month, later, bertrand, russell, visited, conrad, at, capel, house, in, orlestone, and, the, same, day, on, the, train, wrote, down, his, impressions, it, was, wonderful, i, loved, him, i, think, he, liked, me, he, talked, a, great, deal, about, his, work, life, aims, about, other, writers, then, we, went, for, a, little, walk, somehow, grew, very, intimate, i, plucked, up, courage, to, tell, him, what, i, find, in, his, work, the, boring, down, into, things, to, get, to, the, very, bottom, below, the, apparent, facts, he, seemed, to, feel, i, had, understood, him, then, i, stopped, we, just, looked, into, each, other, s, eyes, for, some, time, then, he, said, he, had, grown, to, wish, he, could, live, on, the, surface, and, write, differently, that, he, had, grown, frightened, his, eyes, at, the, moment, expressed, the, inward, pain, terror, that, one, feels, him, always, fighting, then, he,
