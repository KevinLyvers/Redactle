emily, elizabeth, dickinson, december, 10, 1830, may, 15, 1886, was, an, american, poet, little, known, during, her, life, she, has, since, been, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, important, figures, in, american, poetry, dickinson, was, born, in, amherst, massachusetts, into, a, prominent, family, with, strong, ties, to, its, community, after, studying, at, the, amherst, academy, for, seven, years, in, her, youth, she, briefly, attended, the, mount, holyoke, female, seminary, before, returning, to, her, family, s, home, in, amherst, evidence, suggests, that, dickinson, lived, much, of, her, life, in, isolation, considered, an, eccentric, by, locals, she, developed, a, penchant, for, white, clothing, and, was, known, for, her, reluctance, to, greet, guests, or, later, in, life, even, to, leave, her, bedroom, dickinson, never, married, and, most, of, her, friendships, were, based, entirely, upon, correspondence, although, dickinson, was, a, prolific, writer, her, only, publications, during, her, lifetime, were, 10, of, her, nearly, 1, 800, poems, and, one, letter, the, poems, published, then, were, usually, edited, significantly, to, fit, conventional, poetic, rules, her, poems, were, unique, for, her, era, they, contain, short, lines, typically, lack, titles, and, often, use, slant, rhyme, as, well, as, unconventional, capitalization, and, punctuation, many, of, her, poems, deal, with, themes, of, death, and, immortality, two, recurring, topics, in, letters, to, her, friends, aesthetics, society, nature, and, spirituality, although, dickinson, s, acquaintances, were, most, likely, aware, of, her, writing, it, was, not, until, after, she, died, in, 1886, when, lavinia, dickinson, s, younger, sister, discovered, her, cache, of, poems, that, her, work, became, public, her, first, published, collection, of, poetry, was, made, in, 1890, by, her, personal, acquaintances, thomas, wentworth, higginson, and, mabel, loomis, todd, though, they, heavily, edited, the, content, a, complete, collection, of, her, poetry, first, became, available, in, 1955, when, scholar, thomas, h, johnson, published, the, poems, of, emily, dickinson, in, 1998, the, new, york, times, reported, on, a, study, in, which, infrared, technology, revealed, that, certain, poems, of, dickinson, s, had, been, deliberately, censored, to, exclude, the, name, susan, at, least, eleven, of, dickinson, s, poems, were, dedicated, to, her, sister, in, law, susan, huntington, gilbert, dickinson, and, all, the, dedications, were, later, obliterated, presumably, by, todd, this, censorship, serves, to, obscure, the, nature, of, emily, and, susan, s, relationship, which, many, scholars, have, interpreted, as, romantic, emily, elizabeth, dickinson, was, born, at, the, family, s, homestead, in, amherst, massachusetts, on, december, 10, 1830, into, a, prominent, but, not, wealthy, family, her, father, edward, dickinson, was, a, lawyer, in, amherst, and, a, trustee,

family, including, his, grandson, the, organist, and, composer, clarence, dickinson, by, all, accounts, young, dickinson, was, a, well, behaved, girl, on, an, extended, visit, to, monson, when, she, was, two, dickinson, s, aunt, lavinia, described, her, as, perfectly, well, and, contented, she, is, a, very, good, child, and, but, little, trouble, dickinson, s, aunt, also, noted, the, girl, s, affinity, for, music, and, her, particular, talent, for, the, piano, which, she, called, the, moosic, dickinson, attended, primary, school, in, a, two, story, building, on, pleasant, street, her, education, was, ambitiously, classical, for, a, victorian, girl, wanting, his, children, to, be, well, educated, her, father, followed, their, progress, even, while, away, on, business, when, dickinson, was, seven, he, wrote, home, reminding, his, children, to, keep, school, and, learn, so, as, to, tell, me, when, i, come, home, how, many, new, things, you, have, learned, while, dickinson, consistently, described, her, father, warmly, her, correspondence, suggests, that, her, mother, was, regularly, cold, and, aloof, in, a, letter, to, a, confidante, dickinson, wrote, she, always, ran, home, to, awe, when, a, child, if, anything, befell, me, she, was, an, awful, mother, but, i, liked, her, better, than, none, on, september, 7, 1840, dickinson, and, her, sister, lavinia, started, together, at, amherst, academy, a, former, boys, school, that, had, opened, to, female, students, just, two, years, earlier, at, about, the, same, time, her, father, purchased, a, house, on, north, pleasant, street, dickinson, s, brother, austin, later, described, this, large, new, home, as, the, mansion, over, which, he, and, dickinson, presided, as, lord, and, lady, while, their, parents, were, absent, the, house, overlooked, amherst, s, burial, ground, described, by, one, local, minister, as, treeless, and, forbidding, they, shut, me, up, in, prose, as, when, a, little, girl, they, put, me, in, the, closet, because, they, liked, me, still, still, could, themself, have, peeped, and, seen, my, brain, go, round, they, might, as, wise, have, lodged, a, bird, for, treason, in, the, pound, emily, dickinson, c, 1862, dickinson, spent, seven, years, at, the, academy, taking, classes, in, english, and, classical, literature, latin, botany, geology, history, mental, philosophy, and, arithmetic, daniel, taggart, fiske, the, school, s, principal, at, the, time, would, later, recall, that, dickinson, was, very, bright, and, an, excellent, scholar, of, exemplary, deportment, faithful, in, all, school, duties, although, she, took, a, few, terms, off, due, to, illness, the, longest, of, which, was, in, 1845, 1846, when, she, was, enrolled, for, only, eleven, weeks, she, enjoyed, her, strenuous, studies, writing, to, a, friend, that, the, academy, was, a, very, fine, school, dickinson, was, troubled, from, a, young, age, by, the, deepening, menace, of, death, especially, the, deaths, of, those, who, were, close, to, her, when, sophia, holland, her, second, cousin, and, a, close, friend, grew, ill, from, typhus, and, died, in, april, 1844, dickinson, was, traumatized, recalling, the, incident, two, years, later, she, wrote, that, it, seemed, to, me, i, should, die, too, if, i, could, not, be, permitted, to, watch, over, her, or, even, look, at, her, face, she, became, so, melancholic, that, her, parents, sent, her, to, stay, with, family, in, boston, to, recover, with, her, health, and, spirits, restored, she, soon, returned, to, amherst, academy, to, continue, her, studies, during, this, period, she, met, people, who, were, to, become, lifelong, friends, and, correspondents, such, as, abiah, root, abby, wood, jane, humphrey, and, susan, huntington, gilbert, who, later, married, dickinson, s, brother, austin, in, 1845, a, religious, revival, took, place, in, amherst, resulting, in, 46, confessions, of, faith, among, dickinson, s, peers, dickinson, wrote, to, a, friend, the, following, year, i, never, enjoyed, such, perfect, peace, and, happiness, as, the, short, time, in, which, i, felt, i, had, found, my, savior, she, went, on, to, say, it, was, her, greatest, pleasure, to, commune, alone, with, the, great, god, to, feel, that, he, would, listen, to, my, prayers, the, experience, did, not, last, dickinson, never, made, a, formal, declaration, of, faith, and, attended, services, regularly, for, only, a, few, years, after, her, church, going, ended, about, 1852, she, wrote, a, poem, opening, some, keep, the, sabbath, going, to, church, i, keep, it, staying, at, home, during, the, last, year, of, her, stay, at, the, academy, dickinson, became, friendly, with, leonard, humphrey, its, popular, new, young, principal, after, finishing, her, final, term, at, the, academy, on, august, 10, 1847, dickinson, began, attending, mary, lyon, s, mount, holyoke, female, seminary, which, later, became, mount, holyoke, college, in, south, hadley, about, ten, miles, 16, km, from, amherst, she, stayed, at, the, seminary, for, only, ten, months, although, she, liked, the, girls, at, mount, holyoke, dickinson, made, no, lasting, friendships, there, the, explanations, for, her, brief, stay, at, mount, holyoke, differ, considerably, either, she, was, in, poor, health, her, father, wanted, to, have, her, at, home, she, rebelled, against, the, evangelical, fervor, present, at, the, school, she, disliked, the, discipline, minded, teachers, or, she, was, simply, homesick, whatever, the, reasons, for, leaving, mount, holyoke, her, brother, austin, appeared, on, march, 25, 1848, to, bring, home, at, all, events, back, in, amherst, dickinson, occupied, her, time, with, household, activities, she, took, up, baking, for, the, family, and, enjoyed, attending, local, events, and, activities, in, the, budding, college, town, when, she, was, eighteen, dickinson, s, family, befriended, a, young, attorney, by, the, name, of, benjamin, franklin, newton, according, to, a, letter, written, by, dickinson, after, newton, s, death, he, had, been, with, my, father, two, years, before, going, to, worcester, in, pursuing, his, studies, and, was, much, in, our, family, although, their, relationship, was, probably, not, romantic, newton, was, a, formative, influence, and, would, become, the, second, in, a, series, of, older, men, after, humphrey, that, dickinson, referred, to, variously, as, her, tutor, preceptor, or, master, newton, likely, introduced, her, to, the, writings, of, william, wordsworth, and, his, gift, to, her, of, ralph, waldo, emerson, s, first, book, of, collected, poems, had, a, liberating, effect, she, wrote, later, that, he, whose, name, my, father, s, law, student, taught, me, has, touched, the, secret, spring, newton, held, her, in, high, regard, believing, in, and, recognizing, her, as, a, poet, when, he, was, dying, of, tuberculosis, he, wrote, to, her, saying, he, would, like, to, live, until, she, achieved, the, greatness, he, foresaw, biographers, believe, that, dickinson, s, statement, of, 1862, when, a, little, girl, i, had, a, friend, who, taught, me, immortality, but, venturing, too, near, himself, he, never, returned, refers, to, newton, dickinson, was, familiar, with, not, only, the, bible, but, also, contemporary, popular, literature, she, was, probably, influenced, by, lydia, maria, child, s, letters, from, new, york, another, gift, from, newton, after, reading, it, she, gushed, this, then, is, a, book, and, there, are, more, of, them, her, brother, smuggled, a, copy, of, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, s, kavanagh, into, the, house, for, her, because, her, father, might, disapprove, and, a, friend, lent, her, charlotte, bront, s, jane, eyre, in, late, 1849, jane, eyre, s, influence, cannot, be, measured, but, when, dickinson, acquired, her, first, and, only, dog, a, newfoundland, she, named, him, carlo, after, the, character, st, john, rivers, dog, william, shakespeare, was, also, a, potent, influence, in, her, life, referring, to, his, plays, she, wrote, to, one, friend, why, clasp, any, hand, but, this, and, to, another, why, is, any, other, book, needed, in, early, 1850, dickinson, wrote, amherst, is, alive, with, fun, this, winter, oh, a, very, great, town, this, is, her, high, spirits, soon, turned, to, melancholy, after, another, death, the, amherst, academy, principal, leonard, humphrey, died, suddenly, of, brain, congestion, at, age, 25, two, years, after, his, death, she, revealed, to, her, friend, abiah, root, the, extent, of, her, sadness, some, of, my, friends, are, gone, and, some, of, my, friends, are, sleeping, sleeping, the, churchyard, sleep, the, hour, of, evening, is, sad, it, was, once, my, study, hour, my, master, has, gone, to, rest, and, the, open, leaf, of, the, book, and, the, scholar, at, school, alone, make, the, tears, come, and, i, cannot, brush, them, away, i, would, not, if, i, could, for, they, are, the, only, tribute, i, can, pay, the, departed, humphrey, during, the, 1850s, dickinson, s, strongest, and, most, affectionate, relationship, was, with, her, sister, in, law, susan, gilbert, dickinson, eventually, sent, her, over, three, hundred, letters, more, than, to, any, other, correspondent, over, the, course, of, their, relationship, susan, was, supportive, of, the, poet, playing, the, role, of, most, beloved, friend, influence, muse, and, adviser, whose, editorial, suggestions, dickinson, sometimes, followed, in, an, 1882, letter, to, susan, dickinson, said, with, the, exception, of, shakespeare, you, have, told, me, of, more, knowledge, than, any, one, living, the, importance, of, dickinson, s, relationship, with, susan, gilbert, has, widely, been, overlooked, due, to, a, point, of, view, first, promoted, by, mabel, loomis, todd, who, was, involved, for, many, years, in, a, relationship, with, austin, dickinson, and, who, diminished, gilbert, s, role, in, dickinson, s, life, due, to, her, own, poor, relationship, with, her, lover, s, wife, however, the, notion, of, a, cruel, susan, as, promoted, by, her, romantic, rival, has, been, questioned, most, especially, by, dickinson, s, nieces, and, nephews, susan, and, austin, s, surviving, children, with, whom, dickinson, was, close, many, scholars, interpret, the, relationship, between, emily, and, susan, as, a, romantic, one, in, the, emily, dickinson, journal, lena, koski, wrote, dickinson, s, letters, to, gilbert, express, strong, homoerotic, feelings, she, quotes, from, many, of, their, letters, including, one, from, 1852, in, which, dickinson, proclaims, susie, will, you, indeed, come, home, next, saturday, and, be, my, own, again, and, kiss, me, as, you, used, to, i, hope, for, you, so, much, and, feel, so, eager, for, you, feel, that, i, cannot, wait, feel, that, now, i, must, have, you, that, the, expectation, once, more, to, see, your, face, again, makes, me, feel, hot, and, feverish, and, my, heart, beats, so, fast, my, darling, so, near, i, seem, to, you, that, i, disdain, this, pen, and, wait, for, a, warmer, language, the, relationship, between, emily, and, susan, is, portrayed, in, the, film, wild, nights, with, emily, and, explored, in, the, tv, series, dickinson, susan, gilbert, married, austin, in, 1856, after, a, four, year, courtship, though, their, marriage, was, not, a, happy, one, edward, dickinson, built, a, house, for, austin, which, gilbert, named, the, evergreens, a, stand, of, which, was, located, on, the, west, side, of, the, homestead, until, 1855, dickinson, had, not, strayed, far, from, amherst, that, spring, accompanied, by, her, mother, and, sister, she, took, one, of, her, longest, and, farthest, trips, away, from, home, first, they, spent, three, weeks, in, washington, where, her, father, was, representing, massachusetts, in, congress, after, which, they, would, travel, to, philadelphia, for, two, weeks, to, visit, family, while, in, philadelphia, she, met, charles, wadsworth, a, famous, minister, of, the, arch, street, presbyterian, church, with, whom, she, forged, a, strong, friendship, that, lasted, until, he, died, in, 1882, despite, seeing, him, only, twice, after, 1855, he, moved, to, san, francisco, in, 1862, she, variously, referred, to, him, as, my, philadelphia, my, clergyman, my, dearest, earthly, friend, and, my, shepherd, from, little, girl, hood, from, the, mid, 1850s, dickinson, s, mother, became, effectively, bedridden, with, various, chronic, illnesses, until, she, died, in, 1882, writing, to, a, friend, in, the, summer, of, 1858, dickinson, said, she, would, visit, if, she, could, leave, home, or, mother, i, do, not, go, out, at, all, lest, father, will, come, and, miss, me, or, miss, some, little, act, which, i, might, forget, should, i, run, away, mother, is, much, as, usual, i, know, not, what, to, hope, of, her, as, her, mother, continued, to, decline, dickinson, s, domestic, responsibilities, weighed, more, heavily, upon, her, and, she, confined, herself, within, the, homestead, forty, years, later, lavinia, said, that, because, their, mother, was, chronically, ill, one, of, the, daughters, had, to, remain, always, with, her, dickinson, took, this, role, as, her, own, and, finding, the, life, with, her, books, and, nature, so, congenial, continued, to, live, it, withdrawing, more, and, more, from, the, outside, world, dickinson, began, in, the, summer, of, 1858, what, would, be, her, lasting, legacy, reviewing, poems, she, had, written, previously, she, began, making, clean, copies, of, her, work, assembling, carefully, pieced, together, manuscript, books, the, forty, fascicles, she, created, from, 1858, through, 1865, eventually, held, nearly, eight, hundred, poems, no, one, was, aware, of, the, existence, of, these, books, until, after, her, death, in, the, late, 1850s, the, dickinsons, befriended, samuel, bowles, the, owner, and, editor, in, chief, of, the, springfield, republican, and, his, wife, mary, they, visited, the, dickinsons, regularly, for, years, to, come, during, this, time, dickinson, sent, him, over, three, dozen, letters, and, nearly, fifty, poems, their, friendship, brought, out, some, of, her, most, intense, writing, and, bowles, published, a, few, of, her, poems, in, his, journal, it, was, from, 1858, to, 1861, that, dickinson, is, believed, to, have, written, a, trio, of, letters, that, have, been, called, the, master, letters, these, three, letters, drafted, to, an, unknown, man, simply, referred, to, as, master, continue, to, be, the, subject, of, speculation, and, contention, amongst, scholars, hope, is, the, thing, with, feathers, that, perches, in, the, soul, and, sings, the, tune, without, the, words, and, never, stops, at, all, and, sweetest, in, the, gale, is, heard, and, sore, must, be, the, storm, that, could, abash, the, little, bird, that, kept, so, many, warm, i, ve, heard, it, in, the, chillest, land, and, on, the, strangest, sea, yet, never, in, extremity, it, asked, a, crumb, of, me, emily, dickinson, c, 1861, dickinson, also, became, friends, with, springfield, republican, assistant, editor, j, g, holland, and, his, wife, and, frequently, corresponded, with, them, she, was, a, guest, at, their, springfield, home, on, numerous, occasions, dickinson, sent, more, than, ninety, letters, to, the, hollands, between, 1853, and, 1886, in, which, she, shares, the, details, of, life, that, one, would, impart, to, a, close, family, member, the, status, of, the, garden, the, health, and, activities, of, members, of, the, household, references, to, recently, read, books, emily, was, a, poet, influenced, by, transcendentalism, and, dark, romanticism, and, her, work, bridged, the, gap, to, realism, of, the, ten, poems, published, in, dickinson, s, lifetime, the, springfield, republican, published, five, all, unsigned, with, sam, bowles, and, josiah, holland, as, editors, between, 1852, and, 1866, some, scholars, believe, that, bowles, promoted, her, the, most, dickinson, wrote, letters, and, sent, her, poems, to, both, men, later, as, editor, of, scribner, s, monthly, beginning, in, 1870, holland, told, dickinson, s, childhood, friend, emily, fowler, ford, that, he, had, some, poems, of, under, consideration, for, publication, but, they, really, are, not, suitable, they, are, too, ethereal, the, first, half, of, the, 1860s, after, she, had, largely, withdrawn, from, social, life, proved, to, be, dickinson, s, most, productive, writing, period, modern, scholars, and, researchers, are, divided, as, to, the, cause, for, dickinson, s, withdrawal, and, extreme, seclusion, while, she, was, diagnosed, as, having, nervous, prostration, by, a, physician, during, her, lifetime, some, today, believe, she, may, have, suffered, from, illnesses, as, various, as, agoraphobia, and, epilepsy, julie, brown, writing, in, writers, on, the, spectrum, 2010, argues, that, dickinson, had, autism, spectrum, disorder, asd, but, this, is, generally, regarded, as, being, more, speculation, than, a, retrospective, diagnosis, and, although, the, theory, has, been, echoed, on, the, internet, especially, it, has, not, been, advanced, by, dickinson, scholars, in, april, 1862, thomas, wentworth, higginson, a, literary, critic, radical, abolitionist, and, ex, minister, wrote, a, lead, piece, for, the, atlantic, monthly, titled, letter, to, a, young, contributor, higginson, s, essay, in, which, he, urged, aspiring, writers, to, charge, your, style, with, life, contained, practical, advice, for, those, wishing, to, break, into, print, dickinson, s, decision, to, contact, higginson, suggests, that, by, 1862, she, was, contemplating, publication, and, that, it, may, have, become, increasingly, difficult, to, write, poetry, without, an, audience, seeking, literary, guidance, that, no, one, close, to, her, could, provide, dickinson, sent, him, a, letter, which, read, in, full, mr, higginson, are, you, too, deeply, occupied, to, say, if, my, verse, is, alive, the, mind, is, so, near, itself, it, cannot, see, distinctly, and, i, have, none, to, ask, should, you, think, it, breathed, and, had, you, the, leisure, to, tell, me, i, should, feel, quick, gratitude, if, i, make, the, mistake, that, you, dared, to, tell, me, would, give, me, sincerer, honor, toward, you, i, enclose, my, name, asking, you, if, you, please, sir, to, tell, me, what, is, true, that, you, will, not, betray, me, it, is, needless, to, ask, since, honor, is, it, s, own, pawn, this, highly, nuanced, and, largely, theatrical, letter, was, unsigned, but, she, had, included, her, name, on, a, card, and, enclosed, it, in, an, envelope, along, with, four, of, her, poems, he, praised, her, work, but, suggested, that, she, delay, publishing, until, she, had, written, longer, being, unaware, she, had, already, appeared, in, print, she, assured, him, that, publishing, was, as, foreign, to, her, as, firmament, to, fin, but, also, proposed, that, if, fame, belonged, to, me, i, could, not, escape, her, dickinson, delighted, in, dramatic, self, characterization, and, mystery, in, her, letters, to, higginson, she, said, of, herself, i, am, small, like, the, wren, and, my, hair, is, bold, like, the, chestnut, bur, and, my, eyes, like, the, sherry, in, the, glass, that, the, guest, leaves, she, stressed, her, solitary, nature, saying, her, only, real, companions, were, the, hills, the, sundown, and, her, dog, carlo, she, also, mentioned, that, whereas, her, mother, did, not, care, for, thought, her, father, bought, her, books, but, begged, her, not, to, read, them, because, he, fears, they, joggle, the, mind, dickinson, valued, his, advice, going, from, calling, him, mr, higginson, to, dear, friend, as, well, as, signing, her, letters, your, gnome, and, your, scholar, his, interest, in, her, work, certainly, provided, great, moral, support, many, years, later, dickinson, told, higginson, that, he, had, saved, her, life, in, 1862, they, corresponded, until, her, death, but, her, difficulty, in, expressing, her, literary, needs, and, a, reluctance, to, enter, into, a, cooperative, exchange, left, higginson, nonplussed, he, did, not, press, her, to, publish, in, subsequent, correspondence, dickinson, s, own, ambivalence, on, the, matter, militated, against, the, likelihood, of, publication, literary, critic, edmund, wilson, in, his, review, of, civil, war, literature, surmised, that, with, encouragement, she, would, certainly, have, published, in, direct, opposition, to, the, immense, productivity, that, she, displayed, in, the, early, 1860s, dickinson, wrote, fewer, poems, in, 1866, beset, with, personal, loss, as, well, as, loss, of, domestic, help, dickinson, may, have, been, too, overcome, to, keep, up, her, previous, level, of, writing, carlo, died, during, this, time, after, having, provided, sixteen, years, of, companionship, dickinson, never, owned, another, dog, although, the, household, servant, of, nine, years,

began, to, change, she, did, not, leave, the, homestead, unless, it, was, absolutely, necessary, and, as, early, as, 1867, she, began, to, talk, to, visitors, from, the, other, side, of, a, door, rather, than, speaking, to, them, face, to, face, she, acquired, local, notoriety, she, was, rarely, seen, and, when, she, was, she, was, usually, clothed, in, white, dickinson, s, one, surviving, article, of, clothing, is, a, white, cotton, dress, possibly, sewn, circa, 1878, 1882, few, of, the, locals, who, exchanged, messages, with, dickinson, during, her, last, fifteen, years, ever, saw, her, in, person, austin, and, his, family, began, to, protect, dickinson, s, privacy, deciding, that, she, was, not, to, be, a, subject, of, discussion, with, outsiders, despite, her, physical, seclusion, dickinson, was, socially, active, and, expressive, through, what, makes, up, two, thirds, of, her, surviving, notes, and, letters, when, visitors, came, to, either, the, homestead, or, the, evergreens, she, would, often, leave, or, send, over, small, gifts, of, poems, or, flowers, dickinson, also, had, a, good, rapport, with, the, children, in, her, life, mattie, dickinson, the, second, child, of, austin, and, susan, later, said, that, aunt, emily, stood, for, indulgence, macgregor, mac, jenkins, the, son, of, family, friends, who, later, wrote, a, short, article, in, 1891, called,

they, could, formally, meet, for, the, first, time, she, declined, writing, could, it, please, your, convenience, to, come, so, far, as, amherst, i, should, be, very, glad, but, i, do, not, cross, my, father, s, ground, to, any, house, or, town, it, was, not, until, he, came, to, amherst, in, 1870, that, they, met, later, he, referred, to, her, in, the, most, detailed, and, vivid, physical, account, of, her, on, record, as, a, little, plain, woman, with, two, smooth, bands, of, reddish, hair, in, a, very, plain, exquisitely, clean, white, piqu, a, blue, net, worsted, shawl, he, also,

tended, the, garden, at, homestead, during, her, lifetime, she, assembled, a, collection, of, pressed, plants, in, a, sixty, six, page, leather, bound, herbarium, it, contained, 424, pressed, flower, specimens, that, she, collected, classified, and, labeled, using, the, linnaean, system, the, homestead, garden, was, well, known, and, admired, locally, in, its, time, it, has, not, survived, but, efforts, to, revive, it, have, begun, dickinson, kept, no, garden, notebooks, or, plant, lists, but, a, clear, impression, can, be, formed, from, the, letters, and, recollections, of, friends, and,

her, friends, bunches, of, flowers, with, verses, attached, but, they, valued, the, posy, more, than, the, poetry, on, june, 16, 1874, while, in, boston, edward, dickinson, suffered, a, stroke, and, died, when, the, simple, funeral, was, held, in, the, homestead, s, entrance, hall, dickinson, stayed, in, her, room, with, the, door, cracked, open, neither, did, she, attend, the, memorial, service,

claimed, that, only, essential, changes, were, made, the, poems, were, extensively, edited, to, match, punctuation, and, capitalization, to, late, 19th, century, standards, with, occasional,

completely, new, three, volume, set, edited, by, thomas, h, johnson, forming, the, basis, of, later, dickinson, scholarship, johnson, s, variorum, brought, all, of, dickinson, s, known, poems, together, for, the, first, time, johnson, s, goal, was, to, present, the, poems, very, nearly, as, dickinson, had, left, them, in, her, manuscripts, they, were, untitled, only, numbered, in, an, approximate, chronological, sequence, strewn, with, dashes, and, irregularly, capitalized, and, often, extremely, elliptical, in, their, language, three, years, later, johnson, edited, and, published, along, with, theodora, ward, a, complete, collection, of, dickinson, s, letters, also, presented, in, three, volumes, in, 1981, the, manuscript, books, of, emily, dickinson, was, published, using,

2001, that, the, consequences, of, the, poet, s, failure, to, disseminate, her, work, in, a, faithful, and, orderly, manner, are, still, very, much, with, us, dickinson, s, poems, generally, fall, into, three, distinct, periods, the, works, in, each, period, having, certain, general, characters, in, common, the, extensive, use, of, dashes, and, unconventional, capitalization, in, dickinson, s, manuscripts, and, the, idiosyncratic, vocabulary, and, imagery, combine, to, create, a, body, of, work, that, is, far, more, various, in, its, styles, and, forms, than, is, commonly, supposed, dickinson, avoids, pentameter, opting, more, generally, for, trimeter, tetrameter, and, less, often, dimeter, sometimes, her, use, of, these, meters, is, regular, but, oftentimes, it, is, irregular, the, regular, form, that, she, most, often, employs, is, the, ballad, stanza, a, traditional, form, that, is, divided, into, quatrains, using, tetrameter, for, the, first, and, third, lines, and, trimeter, for, the, second, and, fourth, while, rhyming, the, second, and, fourth, lines, abcb, though, dickinson, often, uses, perfect, rhymes, for, lines, two, and, four, she, also, makes, frequent, use, of, slant, rhyme, in, some, of, her, poems, she, varies, the, meter, from, the, traditional, ballad, stanza, by, using, trimeter, for, lines, one, two, and, four, while, using, tetrameter, for, only, line, three, since, many, of, her, poems, were, written, in, traditional, ballad, stanzas, with, abcb, rhyme, schemes, some, of, these, poems, can, be, sung, to, fit, the, melodies, of, popular, folk, songs, and, hymns, that, also, use, the, common, meter, employing, alternating, lines, of, iambic, tetrameter, and, iambic, trimeter, dickinson, scholar, and, poet, anthony, hecht, finds, resonances, in, dickinson, s, poetry, not, only, with, hymns, and, song, forms, but, also, with, psalms, and, riddles, citing, the, following, example, who, is, the, east, the, yellow, man, who, may, be, purple, if, he, can, that, carries, in, the, sun, who, is, the, west, the, purple, man, who, may, be, yellow, if, he, can, that, lets, him, out, again, late, 20th, century, scholars, are, deeply,

the, increasingly, close, focus, on, dickinson, s, structures, and, syntax, has, come, a, growing, appreciation, that, they, are, aesthetically, based, although, johnson, s, landmark, 1955, edition, of, poems, was, relatively, unaltered, from, the, original, later, scholars, critiqued, it, for, deviating, from, the, style, and, layout, of, dickinson, s, manuscripts, meaningful, distinctions, these, scholars, assert, can, be, drawn, from, varying, lengths, and, angles, of, dash, and, differing, arrangements, of, text, on, the, page, several, volumes, have, attempted, to, render, dickinson,

left, no, formal, statement, of, her, aesthetic, intentions, and, because, of, the, variety, of, her, themes, her, work, does, not, fit, conveniently, into, any, genre, she, has, been, regarded, alongside, emerson, whose, poems, dickinson, admired, as, a, transcendentalist, however, farr, disagrees, with, this, analysis, saying, that, dickinson, s, relentlessly, measuring, mind, deflates,

actions, and, emotions, she, associates, some, flowers, like, gentians, and, anemones, with, youth, and, humility, others, with, prudence, and, insight, her, poems, were, often, sent, to, friends, with, accompanying, letters, and, nosegays, farr, notes, that, one, of, dickinson, s, earlier, poems, written, about, 1859, appears, to, conflate, her, poetry, itself, with, the, posies, my, nosegays,

her, life, she, lived, within, them, often, this, intensely, private, place, is, referred, to, as, the, undiscovered, continent, and, the, landscape, of, the, spirit, and, embellished, with, nature,

poetry, received, mixed, reviews, after, it, was, first, published, in, 1890, higginson, himself, stated, in, his, preface, to, the, first, edition, of, dickinson, s, published, work, that, the, poetry, s, quality, is, that, of, extraordinary, grasp, and, insight, albeit, without, the, proper, control, and, chastening, that, the, experience, of, publishing, during, her, lifetime, might, have, conferred, his, judgment, that, her, opus, was, incomplete, and, unsatisfactory, would, be, echoed, in, the, essays, of, the, new, critics, in, the, 1930s, maurice, thompson, who, was, literary, editor, of, the, independent, for, twelve, years, noted, in, 1891, that, her, poetry, had, a, strange, mixture, of, rare, individuality, and, originality, some, critics, hailed, dickinson, s, effort, but, disapproved, of, her, unusual, non, traditional, style, andrew, lang, a, british, writer, dismissed, dickinson, s, work, stating, that, if, poetry, is, to, exist, at, all, it, really, must, have, form, and, grammar, and, must, rhyme, when, it, professes, to, rhyme, the, wisdom, of, the, ages, and, the, nature, of, man, insist, on, so, much, thomas, bailey, aldrich, a, poet, and, novelist, equally, dismissed, dickinson, s, poetic, technique, in, the, atlantic, monthly, in, january, 1892, it, is, plain, that, miss, dickinson, possessed, an, extremely, unconventional, and, grotesque, fancy, she, was, deeply, tinged, by, the, mysticism, of, blake, and, strongly, influenced, by, the, mannerism, of, emerson, but, the, incoherence, and, formlessness, of, her, versicles, are, fatal,

grammar, critical, attention, to, dickinson, s, poetry, was, meager, from, 1897, to, the, early, 1920s, by, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, interest, in, her, poetry, became, broader, in, scope, and, some, critics, began, to, consider, dickinson, as, essentially, modern, rather, than, seeing, dickinson, s, poetic, styling, as, a, result, of, a, lack, of, knowledge, or, skill, modern, critics, believed, the, irregularities, were, consciously, artistic, in, a, 1915, essay, elizabeth, shepley, sergeant, called, the, poet, s, inspiration, daring, and, named, her, one, of, the, rarest, flowers, the, sterner, new, england, land, ever, bore, with, the, growing, popularity, of, modernist, poetry, in, the, 1920s, dickinson, s, failure, to, conform, to, 19th, century, poetic, form, was, no, longer, surprising, nor, distasteful, to, new, generations, of, readers, dickinson, was, suddenly, referred, to, by, various, critics, as, a, great, woman, poet, and, a, cult, following, began, to, form, in, the, 1930s, a, number, of, the, new, critics, among, them, r, p, blackmur, allen, tate, cleanth, brooks, and, yvor, winters, appraised, the, significance, of, dickinson, s, poetry, as, critic, roland, hagenb, chle, pointed, out, their, affirmative, and, prohibitive, tenets, turned, out, to, be, of, special, relevance, to, dickinson, scholarship, blackmur, in, an, attempt, to, focus, and, clarify, the, major, claims, for, and, against, the, poet, s, greatness, wrote, in, a, landmark, 1937, critical, essay, she, was, a, private, poet, who, wrote, as, indefatigably, as, some, women, cook, or, knit, her, gift, for, words, and, the, cultural, predicament, of, her, time, drove, her, to, poetry, instead, of, antimacassars, she, came, at, the, right, time, for, one, kind, of, poetry, the, poetry, of, sophisticated, eccentric, vision, the, second, wave, of, feminism, created, greater, cultural, sympathy, for, her, as, a, female, poet, in, the, first, collection, of, critical, essays, on, dickinson, from, a, feminist, perspective, she, is, heralded, as, the, greatest, woman, poet, in, the, english, language, biographers, and, theorists, of, the, past, tended, to, separate, dickinson, s, roles, as, a, woman, and, a, poet, for, example, george, whicher, wrote, in, his, 1952, book, this, was, a, poet, a, critical, biography, of, emily, dickinson, perhaps, as, a, poet, could, find, the, fulfillment, she, had, missed, as, a, woman, feminist, criticism, on, the, other, hand, declares, that, there, is, a, necessary, and, powerful, conjunction, between, dickinson, being, a, woman, and, a, poet, adrienne, rich, theorized, in, vesuvius, at, home, the, power, of, emily, dickinson, 1976, that, dickinson, s, identity, as, a, woman, poet, brought, her, power, chose, her, seclusion, knowing, she, was, exceptional, and, knowing, what, she, needed, she, carefully, selected, her, society, and, controlled, the, disposal, of, her, time, neither, eccentric, nor, quaint, she, was, determined, to, survive, to, use, her, powers, to, practice, necessary, economics, some, scholars, question, the, poet, s, sexuality, theorizing, that, the, numerous, letters, and, poems, that, were, dedicated, to, susan, gilbert, dickinson, indicate, a, lesbian, romance, and, speculating, about, how, this, may, have, influenced, her, poetry, critics, such, as, john, cody, lillian, faderman, vivian, r, pollak, paula, bennett, judith, farr, ellen, louise, hart, and, martha, nell, smith, have, argued, that, susan, was, the, central, erotic, relationship, in, dickinson, s, life, in, the, early, 20th, century, martha, dickinson, bianchi, and, millicent, todd, bingham, kept, the, achievement, of, emily, dickinson, alive, bianchi, promoted, dickinson, s, poetic, achievement, bianchi, inherited, the, evergreens, as, well, as, the, copyright, for, her, aunt, s, poetry, from, her, parents, publishing, works, such, as, emily, dickinson, face, to, face, and, letters, of, emily, dickinson, which, stoked, public, curiosity, about, her, aunt, bianchi, s, books, perpetrated, legends, about, her, aunt, in, the, context, of, family, tradition, personal, recollection, and, correspondence, in, contrast, millicent, todd, bingham, s, took, a, more, objective, and, realistic, approach, to, the, poet, emily, dickinson, is, now, considered, a, powerful, and, persistent, figure, in, american, culture, although, much, of, the, early, reception, concentrated, on, dickinson, s, eccentric, and, secluded, nature, she, has, become, widely, acknowledged, as, an, innovative, proto, modernist, poet, as, early, as, 1891, william, dean, howells, wrote, that, if, nothing, else, had, come, out, of, our, life, but, this, strange, poetry, we, should, feel, that, in, the, work, of, emily, dickinson, america, or, new, england, rather, had, made, a, distinctive, addition, to, the, literature, of, the, world, and, could, not, be, left, out, of, any, record, of, it, critic,
