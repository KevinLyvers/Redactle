treason, a, different, camp, supported, and, encouraged, brandt, s, neue, ostpolitik, as, aiming, at, change, through, rapprochement, wandel, durch, ann, herung, encouraging, change, through, a, policy, of, engagement, with, the, communist, eastern, bloc, rather, than, trying, to, isolate, these, countries, diplomatically, and, commercially, brandt, s, supporters, claim, that, the, policy, did, help, to, break, down, the, eastern, bloc, s, siege, mentality, and, also, helped, to, increase, its, awareness, of, the, contradictions, in, its, brand, of, socialism, communism, which, together, with, other, events, eventually, led, to, the, downfall, of, eastern, european, communism, brandt, s, predecessor, as, chancellor, kurt, georg, kiesinger, had, been, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, and, was, a, more, old, fashioned, conservative, liberal, intellectual, brandt, having, fought, the, nazis, and, having, faced, down, communist, eastern, germany, during, several, crises,

cabinet, brandt, helped, to, gain, further, international, approval, for, western, germany, and, he, laid, the, foundation, stones, for, his, future, neue, ostpolitik, there, was, a, wide, public, opinion, gap, between, kiesinger, and, brandt, in, the, west, german, polls, both, men, had, come, to, their, own, terms, with, the, new, baby, boomer, lifestyles, kiesinger, considered, them, to, be, a, shameful, crowd, of, long, haired, drop, outs, who, needed, a, bath, and, someone, to, discipline, them, on, the, other, hand, brandt, needed, a, while, to, get, into, contact, with, and, to, earn, credibility, among, the, ausserparlamentarische, opposition, apo, the, extra, parliamentary, opposition, the, students, questioned, west, german, society, in, general, seeking, social, legal, and, political, reforms, the, unrest, led, to, a, renaissance, of, right, wing, parties, in, some, of, the, bundeslands, german, states, under, the, bundesrepublik, parliaments, brandt, however, represented, a, figure, of, change, and, he, followed, a, course, of, social, legal, and, political, reforms, in, 1969, brandt, gained, a, small, majority, by, forming, a, coalition, with, the, fdp, in, his, first, speech, before, the, bundestag, as, the, chancellor, brandt, set, forth, his, political, course, of, reforms, ending, the, speech, with, his, famous, words, wir, wollen, mehr, demokratie, wagen, literally, let, s, dare, more, democracy, or, more, figuratively, we, want, to, take, a, chance, on, more, democracy, this, speech, made, brandt, as, well, as, the, social, democratic, party, popular, among, most, of, the, students, and, other, young, west, german, baby, boomers, who, dreamed, of, a, country, that, would, be, more, open, and, more, colorful, than, the, frugal, and, still, somewhat, authoritarian, bundesrepublik, that, had, been, built, after, world, war, ii, however, brandt, s, neue, ostpolitik, lost, him, a, large, part, of, the, german, refugee,

on, three, days, later, in, the, event, this, motion, passed, cdu, leader, rainer, barzel, would, have, replaced, brandt, as, chancellor, on, paper, the, opposition, now, had, 250, votes, just, one, over, the, 249, needed, to, oust, brandt, even, brandt, himself, believed, he, was, finished, and, a, number, of, unions, went, on, strike, in, anticipation, of, brandt, s, expected, defeat, on, the, floor, of, the, bundestag, to, everyone, s, surprise, the, motion, failed, barzel, got, only, 247, votes, out, of, 260, votes, cast, two, short, of, what, he, needed, to, become, chancellor, there, were, also, 10, votes, against, the, motion, and, three, invalid, ballots, most, spd, and, fdp, deputies, abstained, which, had, the, same, effect, as, voting, for, brandt, though, brandt, remained, chancellor, he, had, lost, his, majority, subsequent, initiatives, in, parliament, most, notably, on, the, budget, failed, because, of, this, stalemate, the, bundestag, was, dissolved, and, new, elections, were, called, during, the, 1972, campaign, many, popular, west, german, artists, intellectuals, writers, actors, and, professors, supported, brandt, and, the, spd, among, them, were, g, nter, grass, walter, jens, and, even, the, soccer, player, paul, breitner, brandt, s, ostpolitik, as, well, as, his, reformist, domestic, policies, were, popular, with, parts, of, the, young, generation, and, he, led, the, spd, to, its, best, ever, federal, election, result, in, late, 1972, however, the, willy, wahl, brandt, s, landslide, win, was, the, beginning, of, the, end, and, brandt, s, role, in, government, started, to, decline, many, of, his, reforms, met, with, resistance, from, state, governments, dominated, by, cdu, csu, the, spirit, of, reformist, optimism, was, cut, short, by, the, 1973, oil, crisis, and, the, major, public, services, strike, 1974, which, gave, germany, s, trade, unions, led, by, heinz, kluncker, a, big, wage, increase, but, reduced, brandt, s, financial, leeway, for, further, reforms, brandt, was, said, to, be, more, a, dreamer, than, a, manager, and, was, personally, haunted, by, depression, to, counter, any, notions, about, being, sympathetic, to, communism, or, soft, on, left, wing, extremists, brandt, implemented, tough, legislation, that, barred, radicals, from, public, service, radikalenerlass, around, 1973, west, german, security, organizations, received, information, that, one, of, brandt, s, personal, assistants, g, nter, guillaume, was, a, spy, for, the, east, german, intelligence, services, brandt, was, asked, to, continue, working, as, usual, and, he, agreed, to, do, so, even, taking, a, private, vacation, with, guillaume, guillaume, was, arrested, on, 24, april, 1974, and, many, blamed, brandt, for, having, a, communist, spy, in, his, inner, circle, brandt, resigned, from, his, position, as, chancellor, on, 6, may, 1974, but, he, remained, a, member, of, the, bundestag, and, chairman, of, the, social, democrats, until, 1987, this, espionage, affair, is, widely, considered, to, have, been, just, the, trigger, for, brandt, s, resignation, not, the, fundamental, cause, as, brandt, himself, later, said, i, was, exhausted, for, reasons, which, had, nothing, to, do, with, the, affair, going, on, at, the, time, brandt, was, dogged, by, scandals, about, serial, adultery, and, reportedly, also, struggled, with, alcohol, and, depression, there, was, also, the, economic, fallout, on, west, germany, of, the, 1973, oil, crisis, which, may, seem, to, have, given, enough, stress, to, finish, off, brandt, as, the, chancellor, guillaume, had, been, an, espionage, agent, for, east, germany, who, was, supervised, by, markus, wolf, the, head, of, the, main, directorate, for, reconnaissance, hauptverwaltung, aufkl, rung, or, hva, the, foreign, intelligence, service, of, the, east, german, ministry, for, state, security, wolf, stated, after, the, reunification, that, the, resignation, of, brandt, had, never, been, intended, and, that, the, planting, and, handling, of, guillaume, had, been, one, of, the, biggest, mistakes, of, the, east, german, secret, services, brandt, was, succeeded, as, the, chancellor, of, the, bundesrepublik, by, his, fellow, social, democrat, helmut, schmidt, for, the, rest, of, his, life, brandt, remained, suspicious, that, his, fellow, social, democrat, and, longtime, rival, herbert, wehner, had, been, scheming, for, brandt, s, downfall, however, there, is, scant, evidence, to, corroborate, this, suspicion, after, his, term, as, the, chancellor, brandt, retained, his, seat, in, the, bundestag, and, he, remained, the, chairman, of, the, social, democratic, party, through, 1987, beginning, in, 1987, brandt, stepped, down, to, become, the, honorary, chairman, of, the, party, brandt, was, also, a, member, of, the, european, parliament, from, 1979, to, 1983, for, sixteen, years, 1976, 92, brandt, was, the, president, of, the, socialist, international, during, that, period, the, number, of, socialist, international, s, mainly, european, member, parties, grew, until, there, were, more, than, a, hundred, socialist, social, democratic, and, labour, political, parties, around, the, world, for, the, first, seven, years, this, growth, in, si, membership, had, been, prompted, by, the, efforts, of, the, socialist, international, s, secretary, general, the, swede, bernt, carlsson, however, in, early, 1983, a, dispute, arose, about, what, carlsson, perceived, as, the, si, president, s, authoritarian, approach, carlsson, then, rebuked, brandt, saying, this, is, a, socialist, international, not, a, german, international, next, against, some, vocal, opposition, brandt, decided, to, move, the, next, socialist, international, congress, from, sydney, australia, to, portugal, following, this, si, congress, in, april, 1983, brandt, retaliated, against, carlsson, by, forcing, him, to, step, down, from, his, position, however, the, austrian, chancellor, bruno, kreisky, argued, on, behalf, of, brandt, it, is, a, question, of, whether, it, is, better, to, be, pure, or, to, have, greater, numbers, carlsson, was, succeeded, by, the, finn, pentti, v, n, nen, as, secretary, general, of, the, socialist, international, during, brandt, s, presidency, the, si, developed, activities, and, dialogue, on, a, number, of, international, issues, this, concerned, the, east, west, conflict, and, arms, race, on, which, the, si, held, high, level, consultations, with, the, leaderships, of, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, and, on, afghanistan, after, 1979, the, si, met, with, president, jimmy, carter, and, vice, presidents, walter, mondale, and, george, bush, and, with, the, cpsu, secretaries, general, leonid, brezhnev, and, mikhail, gorbachev, and, soviet, head, of, state, andrei, gromyko, the, si, also, developed, active, contacts, to, promote, dialogue, concerning, regional, conflicts, those, included, the, middle, east, where, they, helped, to, build, contacts, between, israel, and, the, plo, and, also, in, southern, africa, and, central, america, in, 1977, brandt, was, appointed, as, the, chairman, of, the, independent, commission, for, international, developmental, issues, this, produced, a, report, in, 1980, which, called, for, drastic, changes, in, the, global, attitude, towards, development, in, the, third, world, this, became, known, as, the, brandt, report, in, october, 1979, brandt, met, with, the, east, german, dissident, rudolf, bahro, who, had, written, the, alternative, bahro, and, his, supporters, were, attacked, by, the, east, german, state, security, organization, stasi, headed, by, erich, mielke, for, his, writings, which, had, laid, the, theoretical, foundation, of, a, left, wing, opposition, to, the, ruling, sed, party, and, its, dependent, allies, and, which, promoted, new, and, changed, parties, all, of, this, is, now, described, as, change, from, within, brandt, had, asked, for, bahro, s, release, and, brandt, welcomed, bahro, s, theories, which, advanced, the, debate, within, his, own, social, democratic, party, on, 11, september, 1988, brandt, described, the, hope, for, german, reunification, as, a, delusion, in, late, 1989, brandt, became, one, of, the, first, leftwing, leaders, in, west, germany, to, publicly, favor, a, quick, reunification, of, germany, instead, of, some, sort, of, two, state, federation, or, other, kind, of, interim, arrangement, brandt, s, public, statement, now, grows, together, what,
