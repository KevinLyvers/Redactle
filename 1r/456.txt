preferred, the, more, idealistic, charles, francis, adams, sr, a, loyal, brown, man, alerted, the, governor, of, this, betrayal, and, governor, brown, and, his, cousin, francis, preston, blair, sped, to, cincinnati, to, rally, their, supporters, to, greeley, while, in, cincinnati, he, met, fellow, reformist, newspapermen, samuel, bowles, murat, halstead, horace, white, and, alexander, mcclure, he, also, met, greeley, s, assistant, and, campaign, manager, whitelaw, reid, who, would, become, pulitzer, s, journalistic, adversary, however, greeley, s, campaign, was, ultimately, a, disaster, and, the, new, party, collapsed, leaving, schurz, and, pulitzer, politically, homeless, in, 1874, pulitzer, promoted, a, reform, movement, christened, the, people, s, party, which, united, the, grange, with, dissident, republicans, however, pulitzer, was, disappointed, with, the, party, s, tepid, stances, on, the, issues, and, mediocre, ticket, led, by, gentleman, farmer, william, gentry, he, returned, to, st, louis, and, endorsed, the, democratic, ticket, pulitzer, s, own, views, were, in, line, with, democratic, orthodoxy, on, low, tariffs, and, limited, federal, powers, his, prior, opposition, to, the, democrats, was, out, of, disgust, for, slavery, and, the, confederate, rebellion, pulitzer, campaigned, for, the, democratic, ticket, throughout, the, state, and, published, a,

louis, arguing, successfully, for, true, home, rule, for, the, city, in, 1876, pulitzer, by, now, completely, disillusioned, with, the, corruption, of, the, republicans, and, their, nomination, of, rutherford, b, hayes, gave, nearly, 70, speeches, in, favor, of, democratic, candidate, samuel, j, tilden, throughout, the, country, schurz, who, saw, hayes, as, a, reformer, with, integrity, returned, to, the, republican, fold, in, his, speeches, pulitzer, denounced, schurz, and, urged, reconciliation, between, north, and, south, while, on, his, speaking, tour, pulitzer, also, wrote, dispatches, to, the, new, york, sun, on, behalf, of, the, samuel, tilden, 1876, presidential, campaign, after, tilden, s, narrow, defeat, under, dubious, circumstances, pulitzer, became, disillusioned, with, his, candidate, s, indecision, and, timid, response, he, would, oppose, tilden, s, 1880, run, for, the, democratic, nomination, pulitzer, returned, to, st, louis, to, practice, law, and, search, for, future, opportunities, in, news, on, his, thirtieth, birthday, pulitzer, s, home, at, the, old, southern, hotel, burned, to, the, ground, likely, destroying, most, of, his,

and, dispatch, soon, renamed, the, post, dispatch, on, december, 12, with, his, own, paper, pulitzer, developed, his, role, as, a, champion, of, the, common, man, featuring, expos, s, and, a, hard, hitting, populist, approach, the, paper, was, considered, a, leader, in, the, field, of, sensational, journalism, the, circulation, of, the, post, dispatch, steadily, rose, during, pulitzer, s, early, tenure, aided, by, the, collapse, of, the, city, s, other, daily, english, language, paper, the, star, at, the, time, of, merger, the, post, and, dispatch, had, a, combined, circulation, of, under, 4, 000, by, the, end, of, 1879, circulation, was, up, to, 4, 984, and, pulitzer, doubled, the, size, of, the, paper, to, eight, pages, by, the, end, of, 1880, circulation, was, up, to, 8, 740, circulation, rose, dramatically, to, 12, 000, by, march, 1881, and, to, 22, 300, by, september, 1882, pulitzer, bought, two, new, presses, and, increased, staff, pay, to, the, highest, in, the, city, though, he, also, crushed, an, attempt, to, unionize, pulitzer, s, primary, political, rival, at, this, time, was, bourbon, democrat, william, hyde, publisher, of, the, misleadingly, named, missouri, republican, pulitzer, s, much, smaller, paper, won, a, series, of, early, political, skirmishes, over, hyde, first, george, vest, was, elected, to, the, senate, in, 1879, with, pulitzer, s, backing, over, bourbon, samuel, glover, next, pulitzer, secured, election, for, an, anti, tilden, delegation, including, himself, to, the, 1880, democratic, national, convention, over, hyde, s, objection, though, pulitzer, could, not, convince, horatio, seymour, his, preferred, candidate, to, run, the, democrats, did, not, renominate, tilden, in, march, 1882, the, two, men, even, came, to, physical, blows, on, olive, street, but, were, separated, by, a, crowd, before, either, was, injured, in, 1880, pulitzer, made, a, second, run, for, public, office, this, time, for, united, states, representative, from, missouri, s, second, district, however, he, was, resoundingly, defeated, for, the, democratic, nomination, tantamount, to, victory, in, heavily, democratic, st, louis, by, bourbon, thomas, allen, 4, 254, to, 709, when, thomas, allen, died, during, his, first, term, pulitzer, s, post, dispatch, strongly, opposed, the, republican, s, endorsed, candidate, james, broadhead, an, attorney, working, for, the, railroad, magnate, jay, gould, the, election, became, heated, and, post, dispatch, managing, editor, john, cockerill, called, broadhead, s, law, partner, alonzo,

sensation, and, turned, many, conservative, democrats, vehemently, against, pulitzer, and, the, post, dispatch, after, a, grand, jury, inquest, cockerill, was, never, put, on, trial, pulitzer, replaced, him, with, john, dillon, former, owner, of, the, post, and, unlike, pulitzer, and, cockerill, a, well, respected, conservative, native, of, the, city, however, the, incident, permanently, damaged, pulitzer, s, reputation, in, the, city, and, he, began, to, seek, opportunities, elsewhere, in, april, 1883, the, pulitzer, family, traveled, to, new, york, ostensibly, to, start, a, european, vacation, but, actually, so, that, joseph, could, make, an, offer, to, jay, gould, for, ownership, of, the, morning, new, york, world, gould, had, acquired, the, newspaper, as, a, throw, in, in, one, of, his, railroad, deals, and, it, had, been, losing, about, 40, 000, a, year, possibly, because, of, the, stigma, the, unpopular, gould, s, ownership, brought, in, return, for, the, paper, gould, asked, pulitzer, for, a, sum, well, over, a, half, million, dollars, as, well, as, the, retention, of, the, world, s, staff, and, building, after, some, frustration, at, this, demand, and, disagreement, with, his, brother, albert, pulitzer, was, prepared, to, give, up, at, the, urging, of, his, wife, kate, however, he, returned, to, negotiations, with, gould, they, agreed, to, a, sale, for, 346, 000, with, pulitzer, retaining, full, freedom, in, the, selection, of, staff, the, pulitzers, moved, to, new, york, full, time, leasing, a, home, in, gramercy, park, the, world, immediately, gained, 6, 000, readers, in, its, first, two, weeks, under, pulitzer, and, had, more, than, doubled, its, circulation, to, 39, 000, within, three, months, as, he, had, in, st, louis, pulitzer, emphasized, sensational, stories, human, interest, crime, disasters, and, scandal, under, pulitzer, s, leadership, circulation, grew, from, 15, 000, to, 600, 000, making, the, world, the, largest, newspaper, in, the, country, pulitzer, emphasized, broad, appeal, through, short, provocative, headlines, and, sentences, the, world, s, self, described, style, was, brief, breezy, and, briggity, his, world, featured, illustrations, advertising, and, a, culture, of, consumption, for, working, men, crusades, for, reform, and, entertainment, news, were, two, main, staples, for, the, world, pulitzer, explained, that, the, american, people, want, something, terse, forcible, picturesque, striking, something, that, will, arrest, their, attention, enlist, their, sympathy, arouse, their, indignation, stimulate, their, imagination, convince, their, reason, awaken, their, conscience, in, 1887, he, recruited, the, famous, investigative, journalist, nellie, bly, pulitzer, also, constructed, the, new,

campaign, for, cleveland, and, against, republican, james, g, blaine, may, have, been, pivotal, in, securing, the, presidency, for, cleveland, who, won, new, york, s, decisive, votes, by, just, 0, 1, the, campaign, also, boosted, the, world, s, circulation, dramatically, by, election, day, it, averaged, about, 110, 000, copies, per, day, and, its, election, day, special, ran, 223, 680, copies,

elected, to, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, from, new, york, s, ninth, district, as, a, democrat, and, entered, office, on, march, 4, 1885, though, inundated, with, office, seekers, hoping, for, appointment, by, president, elect, cleveland, pulitzer, recommended, only, the, appointments, of, charles, gibson, for, minister, to, berlin, and, pallen, as, consul, general, in, london, but,
