ab, m, s, j, bir, ibn, ayy, n, arabic, variously, called, al, f, al, azd, al, k, f, or, al, s, died, c, 806, 816, is, the, purported, author, of, a, large, number, of, works, in, arabic, often, called, the, jabirian, corpus, the, c, 215, treatises, that, survive, today, mainly, deal, with, alchemy, and, chemistry, magic, and, shi, ite, religious, philosophy, however, the, original, scope, of, the, corpus, was, vast, covering, a, wide, range, of, topics, ranging, from, cosmology, astronomy, and, astrology, over, medicine, pharmacology, zoology, and, botany, to, metaphysics, logic, and, grammar, the, works, attributed, to, jabir, which, are, tentatively, dated, to, c, 850, c, 950, contain, the, oldest, known, systematic, classification, of, chemical, substances, and, the, oldest, known, instructions, for, deriving, an, inorganic, compound, sal, ammoniac, or, ammonium, chloride, from, organic, substances, such, as, plants, blood, and, hair, by, chemical, means, his, works, also, contain, one, of, the, earliest, known, versions, of, the, sulfur, mercury, theory, of, metals, a, mineralogical, theory, that, would, remain, dominant, until, the, 18th, century, a, significant, part, of, jabir, s, writings, deal, with, a, philosophical, theory, known, as, the, science, of, the, balance, arabic, ilm, al, m, z, n, which, was, aimed, at, reducing, all, phenomena, including, material, substances, and, their, elements, to, a, system, of, measures, and, quantitative, proportions, the, jabirian, works, also, contain, some, of, the, earliest, preserved, shi, ite, imamological, doctrines, which, jabir, presented, as, deriving, from, his, purported, master, the, shi, ite, imam, ja, far, al, diq, died, 765, as, early, as, the, 10th, century, the, identity, and, exact, corpus, of, works, of, jabir, was, in, dispute, in, islamic, scholarly, circles, the, authorship, of, all, these, works, by, a, single, figure, and, even, the, existence, of, a, historical, jabir, are, also, doubted, by, modern, scholars, instead, jabir, ibn, hayyan, is, generally, thought, to, have, been, a, pseudonym, used, by, an, anonymous, school, of, shi, ite, alchemists, writing, in, the, late, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, some, arabic, jabirian, works, e, g, the, great, book, of, mercy, and, the, book, of, seventy, were, translated, into, latin, under, the, latinized, name, geber, and, in, 13th, century, europe, an, anonymous, writer, usually, referred, to, as, pseudo, geber, started, to, produce, alchemical, and, metallurgical, writings, under, this, name, it, is, not, clear, whether, jabir, ibn, hayyan, ever, existed, as, a, historical, person, he, is, purported, to, have, lived, in, the, 8th, century, and, to, have, been, a, disciple, of, the, shi, ite, imam, ja, far, al, diq, died, 765, however, he, is, not, mentioned, in, any, historical, source, before, c, 900, and, the, first, known, author, to, write, about, jabir, from, a, biographical, point, of, view, was, the, baghdadi, bibliographer, ibn, al, nad, m, c, 932, 995, in, his, fihrist, the, book, catalogue, written, in, 987, ibn, al, nad, m, compiled, a, list, of, jabir, s, works, adding, a, short, notice, on, the, various, claims, that, were, then, circulating, about, jabir, already, in, ibn, al, nad, m, s, time, there, were, some, people, who, explicitly, asserted, that, jabir, had, never, existed, although, ibn, al, nad, m, himself, disagreed, with, this, claim, jabir, was, often, ignored, by, later, medieval, islamic, biographers, and, historians, but, even, early, shi, ite, biographers, such, as, a, mad, al, barq, died, c, 893, ab, amr, al, kashsh, first, half, of, the, 10th, century, a, mad, ibn, al, al, naj, sh, 983, 1058, and, ab, ja, far, al, s, 995, 1067, who, wrote, long, volumes, on, the, companions, of, the, shi, ite, imams, including, the, many, companions, of, ja, far, al, diq, did, not, mention, jabir, at, all, apart, from, outright, denying, his, existence, there, were, also, some, who, already, in, ibn, al, nad, m, s, time, questioned, whether, the, writings, attributed, to, jabir, were, really, written, by, him, the, authenticity, of, these, writings, was, expressly, denied, by, the, baghdadi, philosopher, ab, sulaym, n, al, sijist, n, c, 912, 985, and, his, pupil, ab, ayy, n, al, taw, d, c, 932, 1023, though, this, may, have, been, related, to, the, hostility, of, both, these, thinkers, to, alchemy, in, general, modern, scholarly, analysis, has, tended, to, confirm, the, inauthenticity, of, the, writings, attributed, to, jabir, much, of, the, philosophical, terminology, used, in, the, jabirian, treatises, was, only, coined, around, the, middle, of, the, 9th, century, and, some, of, the, greek, philosophical, texts, cited, in, the, jabirian, writings, are, known, to, have, been, translated, into, arabic, towards, the, end, of, the, 9th, century, moreover, an, important, part, of, the, corpus, deals, with, early, shi, ite, religious, philosophy, that, is, elsewhere, only, attested, in, late, 9th, century, and, early, 10th, century, sources, as, a, result, the, dating, of, the, jabirian, corpus, to, c, 850, 950, has, been, widely, accepted, in, modern, scholarship, however, it, has, also, been, noted, that, many, jabirian, treatises, show, clear, signs, of, having, been, redacted, multiple, times, and, the, writings, as, we, now, have, them, may, well, have, been, based, on, an, earlier, 8th, century, core, despite, the, obscurity, involved, it, is, not, impossible, that, some, of, these, writings, in, their, earliest, form, were, written, by, a, real, jabir, ibn, hayyan, in, any, case, it, is, clear, that, jabir, s, name, was, used, as, a, pseudonym, by, one, or, more, anonymous, shi, ite, alchemists, writing, in, the, late, 9th, and, early, 10th, centuries, who, also, redacted, the, corpus, as, we, now, know, it, jabir, was, generally, known, by, the, kunya, ab, m, s, father, of, m, s, or, sometimes, ab, abd, all, h, father, of, abd, all, h, and, by, the, nisba, s, attributive, names, al, f, al, azd, al, k, f, or, al, s, his, grandfather, s, name, is, mentioned, by, ibn, al, nadim, as, abd, all, h, if, the, attribution, of, the, name, al, azd, to, jabir, is, authentic, this, would, point, to, his, affiliation, with, the, southern, arabian, yemenite, tribe, of, the, azd, however, it, is, not, clear, whether, jabir, was, an, arab, belonging, to, the, azd, tribe, or, a, non, arab, muslim, client, mawl, of, the, azd, if, he, was, a, non, arab, muslim, client, of, the, azd, he, is, most, likely, to, have, been, persian, given, his, ties, with, eastern, iran, his, nisba, al, s, also, points, to, tus, a, city, in, khurasan, according, to, ibn, al, nad, m, jabir, hailed, from, khurasan, eastern, iran, but, spent, most, of, his, life, in, kufa, iraq, both, regions, where, the, azd, tribe, was, well, settled, various, late, reports, put, his, date, of, death, between, 806, 190, ah, and, 816, 200, ah, given, the, lack, of, independent, biographical, sources, most, of, the, biographical, information, about, jabir, can, be, traced, back, to, the, jabirian, writings, themselves, there, are, references, throughout, the, jabirian, corpus, to, the, shi, ite, imam, ja, far, al, diq, died, 765, whom, jabir, generally, calls, my, master, arabic, sayyid, and, whom, he, represents, as, the, original, source, of, all, his, knowledge, in, one, work, jabir, is, also, represented, as, an, associate, of, the, bactrian, vizier, family, of, the, barmakids, whereas, ibn, al, nad, m, reports, that, some, claimed, jabir, to, have, been, especially, devoted, to, ja, far, ibn, ya, y, al, barmak, 767, 803, the, abbasid, vizier, of, one, thousand, and, one, nights, fame, jabir, s, links, with, the, abbasids, were, stressed, even, more, by, later, tradition, which, turned, him, into, a, favorite, of, the, abbasid, caliph, h, r, n, al, rash, d, c, 763, 809, also, appearing, in, one, thousand, and, one, nights, for, whom, jabir, would, have, composed, a, treatise, on, alchemy, and, who, is, supposed, to, have, commanded, the, translation, of, greek, works, into, arabic, on, jabir, s, instigation, given, jabir, s, purported, ties, with, both, the, shi, ite, imam, ja, far, al, diq, and, the, barmakid, family, who, served, the, abbasids, as, viziers, or, with, the, abbasid, caliphs, themselves, it, has, sometimes, been, thought, plausible, that, ayy, n, al, a, r, hayyan, the, druggist, a, proto, shi, ite, activist, who, was, fighting, for, the, abbasid, cause, in, the, early, 8th, century, may, have, been, jabir, s, father, jabir, s, name, ibn, hayyan, literally, means, the, son, of, hayyan, although, there, is, no, direct, evidence, supporting, this, hypothesis, it, fits, very, well, in, the, historical, context, and, it, allows, one, to, think, of, jabir, however, obscure, as, a, historical, figure, because, ayy, n, al, a, r, was, supposedly, executed, not, long, after, 721, the, hypothesis, even, made, it, possible, to, estimate, jabir, s, date, of, birth, at, c, 721, however, it, has, recently, been, argued, that, ayy, n, al, a, r, probably, lived, at, least, until, c, 744, and, that, as, a, client, mawl, of, the, nakha, tribe, he, is, highly, unlikely, to, have, been, the, father, of, jabir, who, is, supposed, to, have, been, a, client, member, of, the, azd, there, are, about, 600, arabic, works, attributed, to, jabir, ibn, hayyan, that, are, known, by, name, approximately, 215, of, which, are, still, extant, today, though, some, of, these, are, full, length, works, e, g, the, great, book, on, specific, properties, most, of, them, are, relatively, short, treatises, and, belong, to, larger, collections, the, one, hundred, and, twelve, books, the, five, hundred, books, etc, in, which, they, function, rather, more, like, chapters, when, the, individual, chapters, of, some, full, length, works, are, counted, as, separate, treatises, too, the, total, length, of, the, corpus, may, be, estimated, at, 3000, treatises, chapters, the, overwhelming, majority, of, jabirian, treatises, that, are, still, extant, today, deal, with, alchemy, or, chemistry, though, these, may, also, contain, religious, speculations, and, discuss, a, wide, range, of, other, topics, ranging, from, cosmology, to, grammar, nevertheless, there, are, also, a, few, extant, treatises, which, deal, with, magic, i, e, the, science, of, talismans, ilm, al, ilasm, t, a, form, of, theurgy, and, the, science, of, specific, properties, ilm, al, khaw, the, science, dealing, with, the, hidden, powers, of, mineral, vegetable, and, animal, substances, and, with, their, practical, applications, in, medical, and, various, other, pursuits, other, writings, dealing, with, a, great, variety, of, subjects, were, also, attributed, to, jabir, this, includes, such, subjects, as, engineering, medicine, pharmacology, zoology, botany, logic, metaphysics, mathematics, astronomy, and, astrology, but, almost, all, of, these, are, lost, today, note, that, paul, kraus, who, first, catalogued, the, jabirian, writings, and, whose, numbering, is, followed, here, conceived, of, his, division, of, jabir, s, alchemical, writings, kr, nos, 5, 1149, as, roughly, chronological, in, order, among, the, surviving, jabirian, treatises, there, are, also, a, number, of, relatively, independent, treatises, dealing, with, the, science, of, talismans, ilm, al, ilasm, t, a, form, of, theurgy, and, with, the, science, of, specific, properties, ilm, al, khaw, i, e, the, science, dealing, with, the, hidden, powers, of, mineral, vegetable, and, animal, substances, and, with, their, practical, applications, in, medical, and, various, other, pursuits, these, are, writings, on, a, wide, variety, of, other, topics, were, also, attributed, to, jabir, most, of, these, are, lost, see, below, except, for, although, a, significant, number, of, the, jabirian, treatises, on, alchemy, and, magic, do, survive, many, of, them, are, also, lost, apart, from, two, surviving, treatises, see, immediately, above, jabir, s, many, writings, on, other, topics, are, all, lost, the, jabirian, writings, contain, a, number, of, references, to, greco, egyptian, alchemists, such, as, pseudo, democritus, fl, c, 60, mary, the, jewess, fl, c, 0, 300, agathodaemon, fl, c, 300, and, zosimos, of, panopolis, fl, c, 300, as, well, as, to, legendary, figures, such, as, hermes, trismegistus, and, ostanes, and, to, scriptural, figures, such, as, moses, and, jesus, to, whom, a, number, of, alchemical, writings, were, also, ascribed, however, these, references, may, have, been, meant, as, an, appeal, to, ancient, authority, rather, than, as, an, acknowledgement, of, any, intellectual, borrowing, and, in, any, case, jabirian, alchemy, was, very, different, from, what, is, found, in, the, extant, greek, alchemical, treatises, it, was, much, more, systematic, and, coherent, it, made, much, less, use, of, allegory, and, symbols, and, a, much, more, important, place, was, occupied, by, philosophical, speculations, and, their, application, to, laboratory, experiments, furthermore, whereas, greek, alchemical, texts, had, been, almost, exclusively, focused, on, the, use, of, mineral, substances, i, e, on, inorganic, chemistry, jabirian, alchemy, pioneered, the, use, of, vegetable, and, animal, substances, and, so, represented, an, innovative, shift, towards, organic, chemistry, nevertheless, there, are, some, important, theoretical, similarities, between, jabirian, alchemy, and, contemporary, byzantine, alchemy, and, even, though, the, jabirian, authors, do, not, seem, to, have, known, byzantine, works, that, are, extant, today, such, as, the, alchemical, works, attributed, to, the, neoplatonic, philosophers, olympiodorus, c, 495, 570, and, stephanus, of, alexandria, fl, c, 580, 640, it, seems, that, they, were, at, least, partly, drawing, on, a, parallel, tradition, of, theoretical, and, philosophical, alchemy, in, any, case, the, writings, actually, used, by, the, jabirian, authors, appear, to, have, mainly, consisted, of, alchemical, works, falsely, attributed, to, ancient, philosophers, like, socrates, plato, and, apollonius, of, tyana, only, some, of, which, are, still, extant, today, and, whose, philosophical, content, still, needs, to, be, determined, one, of, the, innovations, in, jabirian, alchemy, was, the, addition, of, sal, ammoniac, ammonium, chloride, to, the, category, of, chemical, substances, known, as, spirits, i, e, strongly, volatile, substances, this, included, both, naturally, occurring, sal, ammoniac, and, synthetic, ammonium, chloride, as, produced, from, organic, substances, and, so, the, addition, of, sal, ammoniac, to, the, list, of, spirits, is, likely, a, product, of, the, new, focus, on, organic, chemistry, since, the, word, for, sal, ammoniac, used, in, the, jabirian, corpus, no, der, is, iranian, in, origin, it, has, been, suggested, that, the, direct, precursors, of, jabirian, alchemy, may, have, been, active, in, the, hellenizing, and, syriacizing, schools, of, the, sassanid, empire, according, to, aristotelian, physics, each, element, is, composed, of, two, qualities, fire, is, hot, and, dry, earth, is, cold, and, dry, water, is, cold, and, moist, and, air, is, hot, and, moist, in, the, jabirian, corpus, these, qualities, came, to, be, called, natures, arabic, ab, i, and, elements, are, said, to, be, composed, of, these, natures, plus, an, underlying, substance, jawhar, in, metals, two, of, these, natures, were, interior, and, two, were, exterior, for, example, lead, was, predominantly, cold, and, dry, and, gold, was, predominantly, hot, and, moist, thus, jabir, theorized, by, rearranging, the, natures, of, one, metal, a, different, metal, would, result, like, zosimos, jabir, believed, this, would, require, a, catalyst, an, al, iksir, the, elusive, elixir, that, would, make, this, transformation, possible, which, in, european, alchemy, became, known, as, the, philosopher, s, stone, the, sulfur, mercury, theory, of, metals, though, first, attested, in, pseudo, apollonius, of, tyana, s, the, secret, of, creation, sirr, al, khal, qa, late, 8th, or, early, 9th, century, but, largely, based, on, older, sources, was, also, adopted, by, the, jabirian, authors, according, to, the, jabirian, version, of, this, theory, metals, form, in, the, earth, through, the, mixing, of, sulfur, and, mercury, depending, on, the, quality, of, the, sulfur, different, metals, are, formed, with, gold, being, formed, by, the, most, subtle, and, well, balanced, sulfur, this, theory, which, is, ultimately, based, on, ancient, meteorological, speculations, such, as, those, found, in, aristotle, s, meteorology, formed, the, basis, of, all, theories, of, metallic, composition, until, the, 18th, century, note, that, some, other, latin, works, attributed, to, jabir, geber, summa, perfectionis, de, inventione, veritatis, de, investigatione, perfectionis, liber, fornacum, testamentum, geberi, and, alchemia, geberi, are, widely, considered, to, be, pseudepigraphs, which, though, largely, drawing, on, arabic, sources, were, originally, written, by, latin, authors, in, the, 13th, 14th, centuries, see, pseudo, geber, see, moureau, 2020, p, 112, cf, forster, 2018
