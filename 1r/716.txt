had, three, children, the, first, died, in, infancy, the, second, born, 10, october, 1861, was, fridtjof, wedel, jarlsberg, nansen, store, fr, en, s, rural, surroundings, shaped, the, nature, of, nansen, s, childhood, in, the, short, summers, the, main, activities, were, swimming, and, fishing, while, in, the, autumn, the, chief, pastime, was, hunting, for, game, in, the, forests, the, long, winter, months, were, devoted, mainly, to, skiing, which, nansen, began, to, practice, at, the, age, of, two, on, improvised, skis, at, the, age, of, 10, he, defied, his, parents, and, attempted, the, ski, jump, at, the, nearby, huseby, installation, this, exploit, had, near, disastrous, consequences, as, on, landing, the, skis, dug, deep, into, the, snow, pitching, the, boy, forward, i, head, first, described, a, fine, arc, in, the, air, hen, i, came, down, again, i, bored, into, the, snow, up, to, my, waist, the, boys, thought, i, had, broken, my, neck, but, as, soon, as, they, saw, there, was, life, in, me, a, shout, of, mocking, laughter, went, up, nansen, s, enthusiasm, for, skiing, was, undiminished, though, as, he, records, his, efforts, were, overshadowed, by, those, of, the, skiers, from, the, mountainous, region, of, telemark, where, a, new, style, of, skiing, was, being, developed, i, saw, this, was, the, only, way, wrote, nansen, later, at, school, nansen, worked, adequately, without, showing, any, particular, aptitude, studies, took, second, place, to, sports, or, to, expeditions, into, the, forests, where, he, would, live, like, robinson, crusoe, for, weeks, at, a, time, through, such, experiences, nansen, developed, a, marked, degree, of, self, reliance, he, became, an, accomplished, skier, and, a, highly, proficient, skater, life, was, disrupted, when, in, the, summer, of, 1877, adelaide, nansen, died, suddenly, distressed, baldur, nansen, sold, the, store, fr, en, property, and, moved, with, his, two, sons, to, christiania, nansen, s, sporting, prowess, continued, to, develop, at, 18, he, broke, the, world, one, mile, 1, 6, km, skating, record, and, in, the, following, year, won, the, national, cross, country, skiing, championship, a, feat, he, would, repeat, on, 11, subsequent, occasions, in, 1880, nansen, passed, his, university, entrance, examination, the, examen, artium, he, decided, to, study, zoology, claiming, later, that, he, chose, the, subject, because, he, thought, it, offered, the, chance, of, a, life, in, the, open, air, he, began, his, studies, at, the, royal, frederick, university, in, christiania, early, in, 1881, early, in, 1882, nansen, took, the, first, fatal, step, that, led, me, astray, from, the, quiet, life, of, science, professor, robert, collett, of, the, university, s, zoology, department, proposed, that, nansen, take, a, sea, voyage, to, study, arctic, zoology, at, first, hand, nansen, was, enthusiastic, and, made, arrangements, through, a, recent, acquaintance, captain, axel, krefting, commander, of, the, sealer, viking, the, voyage, began, on, 11, march, 1882, and, extended, over, the, following, five, months, in, the, weeks, before, sealing, started, nansen, was, able, to, concentrate, on, scientific, studies, from, water, samples, he, showed, that, contrary, to, previous, assumption, sea, ice, forms, on, the, surface, of, the, water, rather, than, below, his, readings, also, demonstrated, that, the, gulf, stream, flows, beneath, a, cold, layer, of, surface, water, through, the, spring, and, early, summer, viking, roamed, between, greenland, and, spitsbergen, in, search, of, seal, herds, nansen, became, an, expert, marksman, and, on, one, day, proudly, recorded, that, his, team, had, shot, 200, seals, in, july, viking, became, trapped, in, the, ice, close, to, an, unexplored, section, of, the, greenland, coast, nansen, longed, to, go, ashore, but, this, was, impossible, however, he, began, to, develop, the, idea, that, the, greenland, icecap, might, be, explored, or, even, crossed, on, 17, july, the, ship, broke, free, from, the, ice, and, early, in, august, was, back, in, norwegian, waters, nansen, did, not, resume, formal, studies, at, the, university, instead, on, collett, s, recommendation, he, accepted, a, post, as, curator, in, the, zoological, department, of, the, bergen, museum, he, was, to, spend, the, next, six, years, of, his, life, there, apart, from, a, six, month, sabbatical, tour, of, europe, working, and, studying, with, leading, figures, such, as, gerhard, armauer, hansen, the, discoverer, of, the, leprosy, bacillus, and, daniel, cornelius, danielssen, the, museum, s, director, who, had, turned, it, from, a, backwater, collection, into, a, centre, of, scientific, research, and, education, nansen, s, chosen, area, of, study, was, the, then, relatively, unexplored, field, of, neuroanatomy, specifically, the, central, nervous, system, of, lower, marine, creatures, before, leaving, for, his, sabbatical, in, february, 1886, he, published, a, paper, summarising, his, research, to, date, in, which, he, stated, that, anastomoses, or, unions, between, the, different, ganglion, cells, could, not, be, demonstrated, with, certainty, this, unorthodox, view, was, confirmed, by, the, simultaneous, research, of, the, embryologist, wilhelm, his, and, the, psychiatrist, august, forel, nansen, is, considered, the, first, norwegian, defender, of, the, neuron, theory, originally, proposed, by, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, his, subsequent, paper, the, structure, and, combination, of, histological, elements, of, the, central, nervous, system, published, in, 1887, became, his, doctoral, thesis, the, idea, of, an, expedition, across, the, greenland, icecap, grew, in, nansen, s, mind, throughout, his, bergen, years, in, 1887, after, the, submission, of, his, doctoral, thesis, he, finally, began, organising, this, project, before, then, the, two, most, significant, penetrations, of, the, greenland, interior, had, been, those, of, adolf, erik, nordenski, ld, in, 1883, and, robert, peary, in, 1886, both, had, set, out, from, disko, bay, on, the, western, coast, and, had, travelled, about, 160, kilometres, 100, mi, eastward, before, turning, back, by, contrast, nansen, proposed, to, travel, from, east, to, west, ending, rather, than, beginning, his, trek, at, disko, bay, a, party, setting, out, from, the, inhabited, west, coast, would, he, reasoned, have, to, make, a, return, trip, as, no, ship, could, be, certain, of, reaching, the, dangerous, east, coast, and, picking, them, up, by, starting, from, the, east, assuming, that, a, landing, could, be, made, there, nansen, s, would, be, a, one, way, journey, towards, a, populated, area, the, party, would, have, no, line, of, retreat, to, a, safe, base, the, only, way, to, go, would, be, forward, a, situation, that, fitted, nansen, s, philosophy, completely, nansen, rejected, the, complex, organisation, and, heavy, manpower, of, other, arctic, ventures, and, instead, planned, his, expedition, for, a, small, party, of, six, supplies, would, be, manhauled, on, specially, designed, lightweight, sledges, much, of, the, equipment, including, sleeping, bags, clothing, and, cooking, stoves, also, needed, to, be, designed, from, scratch, these, plans, received, a, generally, poor, reception, in, the, press, one, critic, had, no, doubt, that, if, scheme, be, attempted, in, its, present, form, the, chances, are, ten, to, one, that, he, will, uselessly, throw, his, own, and, perhaps, others, lives, away, the, norwegian, parliament, refused, to, provide, financial, support, believing, that, such, a, potentially, risky, undertaking, should, not, be, encouraged, the, project, was, eventually, launched, with, a, donation, from, a, danish, businessman, augustin, gam, l, the, rest, came, mainly, from, small, contributions, from, nansen, s, countrymen, through, a, fundraising, effort, organised, by, students, at, the, university, despite, the, adverse, publicity, nansen, received, numerous, applications, from, would, be, adventurers, he, wanted, expert, skiers, and, attempted, to, recruit, from, the, skiers, of, the, telemark, region, but, his, approaches, were, rebuffed, nordenski, ld, had, advised, nansen, that, sami, people, from, finnmark, in, the, far, north, of, norway, were, expert, snow, travellers, so, nansen, recruited, a, pair, samuel, balto, and, ole, nielsen, ravna, the, remaining, places, went, to, otto, sverdrup, a, former, sea, captain, who, had, more, recently, worked, as, a, forester, oluf, christian, dietrichson, an, army, officer, and, kristian, kristiansen, an, acquaintance, of, sverdrup, s, all, had, experience, of, outdoor, life, in, extreme, conditions, and, were, experienced, skiers, just, before, the, party, s, departure, nansen, attended, a, formal, examination, at, the, university, which, had, agreed, to, receive, his, doctoral, thesis, in, accordance, with, custom, he, was, required, to, defend, his, work, before, appointed, examiners, acting, as, devil, s, advocates, he, left, before, knowing, the, outcome, of, this, process, the, sealer, jason, picked, up, nansen, s, party, on, 3, june, 1888, from, the, icelandic, port, of, safj, r, ur, they, sighted, the, greenland, coast, a, week, later, but, thick, pack, ice, hindered, progress, with, the, coast, still, 20, kilometres, 12, mi, away, nansen, decided, to, launch, the, small, boats, they, were, within, sight, of, sermilik, fjord, on, 17, july, nansen, believed, it, would, offer, a, route, up, the, icecap, the, expedition, left, jason, in, good, spirits, and, with, the, highest, hopes, of, a, fortunate, result, days, of, extreme, frustration, followed, as, they, drifted, south, weather, and, sea, conditions, prevented, them, from, reaching, the, shore, they, spent, most, time, camping, on, the, ice, itself, it, was, too, dangerous, to, launch, the, boats, by, 29, july, they, found, themselves, 380, kilometres, 240, mi, south, of, the, point, where, they, left, the, ship, that, day, they, finally, reached, land, but, were, too, far, south, to, begin, the, crossing, nansen, ordered, the, team, back, into, the, boats, after, a, brief, rest, and, to, begin, rowing, north, the, party, battled, northward, along, the, coast, through, the, ice, floes, for, the, next, 12, days, they, encountered, a, large, inuit, encampment, on, the, first, day, near, cape, steen, bille, occasional, contacts, with, the, nomadic, native, population, continued, as, the, journey, progressed, the, party, reached, umivik, bay, on, 11, august, after, covering, 200, kilometres, 120, mi, nansen, decided, they, needed, to, begin, the, crossing, although, they, were, still, far, south, of, his, intended, starting, place, the, season, was, becoming, too, advanced, after, they, landed, at, umivik, they, spent, the, next, four, days, preparing, for, their, journey, they, set, out, on, the, evening, of, 15, august, heading, north, west, towards, christianhaab, on, the, western, shore, of, disko, bay, 600, kilometres, 370, mi, away, over, the, next, few, days, the, party, struggled, to, ascend, the, inland, ice, had, a, treacherous, surface, with, many, hidden, crevasses, and, the, weather, was, bad, progress, stopped, for, three, days, because, of, violent, storms, and, continuous, rain, one, time, the, last, ship, was, due, to, leave, christianhaab, by, mid, september, they, would, not, be, able, to, reach, it, in, time, nansen, concluded, on, 26, august, he, ordered, a, change, of, course, due, west, towards, godthaab, a, shorter, journey, by, at, least, 150, kilometres, 93, mi, the, rest, of, the, party, according, to, nansen, hailed, the, change, of, plan, with, acclamation, they, continued, climbing, until, 11, september, and, reached, a, height, of, 2, 719, metres, 8, 921, ft, above, sea, level, temperatures, on, the, summit, of, the, icecap, dropped, to, 45, c, 49, f, at, night, from, then, on, the, downward, slope, made, travelling, easier, yet, the, terrain, was, rugged, and, the, weather, remained, hostile, progress, was, slow, fresh, snowfalls, made, dragging, the, sledges, like, pulling, them, through, sand, on, 26, september, they, battled, their, way, down, the, edge, of, a, fjord, westward, towards, godthaab, sverdrup, constructed, a, makeshift, boat, out, of, parts, of, the, sledges, willows, and, their, tent, three, days, later, nansen, and, sverdrup, began, the, last, stage, of, the, journey, rowing, down, the, fjord, on, 3, october, they, reached, godthaab, where, the, danish, town, representative, greeted, them, he, first, informed, nansen, that, he, had, secured, his, doctorate, a, matter, that, could, not, have, been, more, remote, from, thoughts, at, that, moment, the, team, accomplished, their, crossing, in, 49, days, throughout, the, journey, they, maintained, meteorological, and, geographical, and, other, records, relating, to, the, previously, unexplored, interior, the, rest, of, the, team, arrived, in, godthaab, on, 12, october, nansen, soon, learned, no, ship, was, likely, to, call, at, godthaab, until, the, following, spring, still, they, were, able, to, send, letters, back, to, norway, via, a, boat, leaving, ivigtut, at, the, end, of, october, he, and, his, party, spent, the, next, seven, months, in, greenland, on, 15, april, 1889, the, danish, ship, hvidbj, rnen, finally, entered, the, harbour, nansen, recorded, it, was, not, without, sorrow, that, we, left, this, place, and, these, people, among, whom, we, had, enjoyed, ourselves, so, well, hvidbj, rnen, reached, copenhagen, on, 21, may, 1889, news, of, the, crossing, had, preceded, its, arrival, and, nansen, and, his, companions, were, feted, as, heroes, this, welcome, however, was, dwarfed, by, the, reception, in, christiania, a, week, later, when, crowds, of, between, thirty, and, forty, thousand, a, third, of, the, city, s, population, thronged, the, streets, as, the, party, made, its, way, to, the, first, of, a, series, of, receptions, the, interest, and, enthusiasm, generated, by, the, expedition, s, achievement, led, directly, to, the, formation, that, year, of, the, norwegian, geographical, society, nansen, accepted, the, position, of, curator, of, the, royal, frederick, university, s, zoology, collection, a, post, which, carried, a, salary, but, involved, no, duties, the, university, was, satisfied, by, the, association, with, the, explorer, s, name, nansen, s, main, task, in, the, following, weeks, was, writing, his, account, of, the, expedition, but, he, found, time, late, in, june, to, visit, london, where, he, met, the, prince, of, wales, the, future, edward, vii, and, addressed, a, meeting, of, the, royal, geographical, society, rgs, the, rgs, president, sir, mountstuart, elphinstone, grant, duff, said, that, nansen, had, claimed, the, foremost, place, amongst, northern, travellers, and, later, awarded, him, the, society, s, prestigious, patron, s, medal, this, was, one, of, many, honours, nansen, received, from, institutions, all, over, europe, he, was, invited, by, a, group, of, australians, to, lead, an, expedition, to, antarctica, but, declined, believing, that, norway, s, interests, would, be, better, served, by, a, north, pole, conquest, on, 11, august, 1889, nansen, announced, his, engagement, to, eva, sars, celebrated, mezzo, soprano, singer, a, pioneer, of, women, s, skiing, and, the, daughter, of, michael, sars, a, theologian, and, zoology, professor, who, had, died, when, eva, was, 11, years, old, the, couple, had, met, some, years, previously, at, the, skiing, resort, of, frognerseteren, where, nansen, recalled, seeing, two, feet, sticking, out, of, the, snow, eva, was, three, years, older, than, nansen, and, despite, the, evidence, of, this, first, meeting, was, an, accomplished, skier, she, was, also, a, celebrated, classical, singer, who, had, been, coached, in, berlin, by, d, sir, e, art, t, one, time, paramour, of, tchaikovsky, the, engagement, surprised, many, since, nansen, had, previously, expressed, himself, forcefully, against, the, institution, of, marriage, otto, sverdrup, assumed, he, had, read, the, message, wrongly, the, wedding, took, place, on, 6, september, 1889, less, than, a, month, after, the, engagement, nansen, first, began, to, consider, the, possibility, of, reaching, the, north, pole, after, reading, meteorologist, henrik, mohn, s, theory, on, transpolar, drift, in, 1884, artefacts, found, on, the, coast, of, greenland, were, identified, to, have, come, from, the, jeannette, expedition, in, june, 1881, uss, jeannette, was, crushed, and, sunk, off, the, siberian, coast, the, opposite, side, of, the, arctic, ocean, mohn, surmised, the, location, of, the, artefacts, indicated, the, existence, of, an, ocean, current, from, east, to, west, all, the, way, across, the, polar, sea, and, possibly, over, the, pole, itself, the, idea, remained, fixated, in, nansen, s, mind, for, the, next, couple, of, years, he, developed, a, detailed, plan, for, a, polar, venture, after, his, triumphant, return, from, greenland, he, made, his, idea, public, in, february, 1890, at, a, meeting, of, the, newly, formed, norwegian, geographical, society, previous, expeditions, he, argued, approached, the, north, pole, from, the, west, and, failed, because, they, were, working, against, the, prevailing, east, west, current, the, secret, was, to, work, with, the, current, a, workable, plan, would, require, a, sturdy, and, manoeuvrable, small, ship, capable, of, carrying, fuel, and, provisions, for, twelve, men, for, five, years, this, ship, would, enter, the, ice, pack, close, to, the, approximate, location, of, jeannette, s, sinking, drifting, west, with, the, current, towards, the, pole, and, beyond, it, eventually, reaching, the, sea, between, greenland, and, spitsbergen, experienced, polar, explorers, were, dismissive, adolphus, greely, called, the, idea, an, illogical, scheme, of, self, destruction, equally, dismissive, were, sir, allen, young, a, veteran, of, the, searches, for, franklin, s, lost, expedition, and, sir, joseph, dalton, hooker, who, had, sailed, to, the, antarctic, on, the, ross, expedition, nansen, still, managed, to, secure, a, grant, from, the, norwegian, parliament, after, an, impassioned, speech, additional, funding, was, secured, through, a, national, appeal, for, private, donations, nansen, chose, the, norwegian, naval, engineer, colin, archer, to, design, and, build, a, ship, archer, designed, an, extraordinarily, sturdy, vessel, with, an, intricate, system, of, crossbeams, and, braces, of, the, toughest, oak, timbers, its, rounded, hull, was, designed, to, push, the, ship, upwards, when, beset, by, pack, ice, speed, and, manoeuvrability, were, to, be, secondary, to, its, ability, as, a, safe, and, warm, shelter, during, their, predicted, confinement, the, length, to, beam, ratio, 39, metre, long, 128, ft, and, 11, metre, wide, 36, ft, gave, it, a, stubby, appearance, justified, by, archer, a, ship, that, is, built, with, exclusive, regard, to, its, suitability, for, object, must, differ, essentially, from, any, known, vessel, it, was, christened, fram, and, launched, on, 6, october, 1892, nansen, selected, a, party, of, twelve, from, thousands, of, applicants, otto, sverdrup, who, took, part, in, nansen, s, earlier, greenland, expedition, was, appointed, as, the, expedition, s, second, in, command, competition, was, so, fierce, that, army, lieutenant, and, dog, driving, expert, hjalmar, johansen, signed, on, as, ship, s, stoker, the, only, position, still, available, fram, left, christiania, on, 24, june, 1893, cheered, on, by, thousands, of, well, wishers, after, a, slow, journey, around, the, coast, the, final, port, of, call, was, vard, in, the, far, north, east, of, norway, fram, left, vard, on, 21, july, following, the, north, east, passage, route, pioneered, by, nordenski, ld, in, 1878, 1879, along, the, northern, coast, of, siberia, progress, was, impeded, by, fog, and, ice, conditions, in, the, mainly, uncharted, seas, the, crew, also, experienced, the, dead, water, phenomenon, where, a, ship, s, forward, progress, is, impeded, by, friction, caused, by, a, layer, of, fresh, water, lying, on, top, of, heavier, salt, water, nevertheless, cape, chelyuskin, the, most, northerly, point, of, the, eurasian, continental, mass, was, passed, on, 10, september, heavy, pack, ice, was, sighted, ten, days, later, at, around, latitude, 78, n, as, fram, approached, the, area, in, which, uss, jeannette, was, crushed, nansen, followed, the, line, of, the, pack, northwards, to, a, position, recorded, as, 78, 49, n, 132, 53, e, 78, 817, n, 132, 883, e, 78, 817, 132, 883, before, ordering, engines, stopped, and, the, rudder, raised, from, this, point, fram, s, drift, began, the, first, weeks, in, the, ice, were, frustrating, as, the, drift, moved, unpredictably, sometimes, north, sometimes, south, by, 19, november, fram, s, latitude, was, south, of, that, at, which, she, had, entered, the, ice, only, after, the, turn, of, the, year, in, january, 1894, did, the, northerly, direction, become, generally, settled, the, 80, n, mark, was, finally, passed, on, 22, march, nansen, calculated, that, at, this, rate, it, might, take, the, ship, five, years, to, reach, the, pole, as, the, ship, s, northerly, progress, continued, at, a, rate, rarely, above, a, kilometre, and, a, half, per, day, nansen, began, privately, to, consider, a, new, plan, a, dog, sledge, journey, towards, the, pole, with, this, in, mind, he, began, to, practice, dog, driving, making, many, experimental, journeys, over, the, ice, in, november, nansen, announced, his, plan, when, the, ship, passed, latitude, 83, n, he, and, hjalmar, johansen, would, leave, the, ship, with, the, dogs, and, make, for, the, pole, while, fram, under, sverdrup, continued, its, drift, until, it, emerged, from, the, ice, in, the, north, atlantic, after, reaching, the, pole, nansen, and, johansen, would, make, for, the, nearest, known, land, the, recently, discovered, and, sketchily, mapped, franz, josef, land, they, would, then, cross, to, spitzbergen, where, they, would, find, a, ship, to, take, them, home, the, crew, spent, the, rest, of, the, winter, of, 1894, preparing, clothing, and, equipment, for, the, forthcoming, sledge, journey, kayaks, were, built, to, be, carried, on, the, sledges, until, needed, for, the, crossing, of, open, water, preparations, were, interrupted, early, in, january, when, violent, tremors, shook, the, ship, the, crew, disembarked, fearing, the, vessel, would, be, crushed, but, fram, proved, herself, equal, to, the, danger, on, 8, january, 1895, the, ship, s, position, was, 83, 34, n, above, greely, s, previous, record, of, 83, 24, n, with, the, ship, s, latitude, at, 84, 4, n, and, after, two, false, starts, nansen, and, johansen, began, their, journey, on, 14, march, 1895, nansen, allowed, 50, days, to, cover, the, 356, nautical, miles, 660, km, 410, mi, to, the, pole, an, average, daily, journey, of, seven, nautical, miles, 13, km, 8, mi, after, a, week, of, travel, a, sextant, observation, indicated, they, averaged, nine, nautical, miles, 17, km, 10, mi, per, day, which, put, them, ahead, of, schedule, however, uneven, surfaces, made, skiing, more, difficult, and, their, speeds, slowed, they, also, realised, they, were, marching, against, a, southerly, drift, and, that, distances, travelled, did, not, necessarily, equate, to, distance, progressed, on, 3, april, nansen, began, to, doubt, whether, the, pole, was, attainable, unless, their, speed, improved, their, food, would, not, last, them, to, the, pole, and, back, to, franz, josef, land, he, confided, in, his, diary, i, have, become, more, and, more, convinced, we, ought, to, turn, before, time, four, days, later, after, making, camp, he, observed, the, way, ahead, was, a, veritable, chaos, of, iceblocks, stretching, as, far, as, the, horizon, nansen, recorded, their, latitude, as, 86, 13, 6, n, almost, three, degrees, beyond, the, previous, record, and, decided, to, turn, around, and, head, back, south, at, first, nansen, and, johansen, made, good, progress, south, but, suffered, a, serious, setback, on, 13, april, when, in, his, eagerness, to, break, camp, they, had, forgotten, to, wind, their, chronometers, which, made, it, impossible, to, calculate, their, longitude, and, accurately, navigate, to, franz, josef, land, they, restarted, the, watches, based, on, nansen, s, guess, they, were, at, 86, e, from, then, on, they, were, uncertain, of, their, true, position, the, tracks, of, an, arctic, fox, were, observed, towards, the, end, of, april, it, was, the, first, trace, of, a, living, creature, other, than, their, dogs, since, they, left, fram, they, soon, saw, bear, tracks, and, by, the, end, of, may, saw, evidence, of, nearby, seals, gulls, and, whales, on, 31, may, nansen, calculated, they, were, only, 50, nautical, miles, 93, km, 58, mi, from, cape, fligely, franz, josef, land, s, northernmost, point, travel, conditions, worsened, as, increasingly, warmer, weather, caused, the, ice, to, break, up, on, 22, june, the, pair, decided, to, rest, on, a, stable, ice, floe, while, they, repaired, their, equipment, and, gathered, strength, for, the, next, stage, of, their, journey, they, remained, on, the, floe, for, a, month, the, day, after, leaving, this, camp, nansen, recorded, at, last, the, marvel, has, come, to, pass, land, land, and, after, we, had, almost, given, up, our, belief, in, it, whether, this, still, distant, land, was, franz, josef, land, or, a, new, discovery, they, did, not, know, they, had, only, a, rough, sketch, map, to, guide, them, the, edge, of, the, pack, ice, was, reached, on, 6, august, and, they, shot, the, last, of, their, dogs, the, weakest, of, which, they, killed, regularly, to, feed, the, others, since, 24, april, the, two, kayaks, were, lashed, together, a, sail, was, raised, and, they, made, for, the, land, it, soon, became, clear, this, land, was, part, of, an, archipelago, as, they, moved, southwards, nansen, tentatively, identified, a, headland, as, cape, felder, on, the, western, edge, of, franz, josef, land, towards, the, end, of, august, as, the, weather, grew, colder, and, travel, became, increasingly, difficult, nansen, decided, to, camp, for, the, winter, in, a, sheltered, cove, with, stones, and, moss, for, building, materials, the, pair, erected, a, hut, which, was, to, be, their, home, for, the, next, eight, months, with, ready, supplies, of, bear, walrus, and, seal, to, keep, their, larder, stocked, their, principal, enemy, was, not, hunger, but, inactivity, after, muted, christmas, and, new, year, celebrations, in, slowly, improving, weather, they, began, to, prepare, to, leave, their, refuge, but, it, was, 19, may, 1896, before, they, were, able, to, resume, their, journey, on, 17, june, during, a, stop, for, repairs, after, the, kayaks, had, been, attacked, by, a, walrus, nansen, thought, he, heard, a, dog, barking, as, well, as, human, voices, he, went, to, investigate, and, a, few, minutes, later, saw, the, figure, of, a, man, approaching, it, was, the, british, explorer, frederick, jackson, who, was, leading, an, expedition, to, franz, josef, land, and, was, camped, at, cape, flora, on, nearby, northbrook, island, the, two, were, equally, astonished, by, their, encounter, after, some, awkward, hesitation, jackson, asked, you, are, nansen, aren, t, you, and, received, the, reply, yes, i, am, nansen, johansen, was, picked, up, and, the, pair, were, taken, to, cape, flora, where, during, the, following, weeks, they, recuperated, from, their, ordeal, nansen, later, wrote, that, he, could, still, scarcely, grasp, their, sudden, change, of, fortune, had, it, not, been, for, the, walrus, attack, that, caused, the, delay, the, two, parties, might, have, been, unaware, of, each, other, s, existence, on, 7, august, nansen, and, johansen, boarded, jackson, s, supply, ship, windward, and, sailed, for, vard, where, they, arrived, on, the, 13th, they, were, greeted, by, hans, mohn, the, originator, of, the, polar, drift, theory, who, was, in, the, town, by, chance, the, world, was, quickly, informed, by, telegram, of, nansen, s, safe, return, but, as, yet, there, was, no, news, of, fram, taking, the, weekly, mail, steamer, south, nansen, and, johansen, reached, hammerfest, on, 18, august, where, they, learned, that, fram, had, been, sighted, she, had, emerged, from, the, ice, north, and, west, of, spitsbergen, as, nansen, had, predicted, and, was, now, on, her, way, to, troms, she, had, not, passed, over, the, pole, nor, exceeded, nansen, s, northern, mark, without, delay, nansen, and, johansen, sailed, for, troms, where, they, were, reunited, with, their, comrades, the, homeward, voyage, to, christiania, was, a, series, of, triumphant, receptions, at, every, port, on, 9, september, fram, was, escorted, into, christiania, s, harbour, and, welcomed, by, the, largest, crowds, the, city, had, ever, seen, the, crew, were, received, by, king, oscar, and, nansen, reunited, with, family, remained, at, the, palace, for, several, days, as, special, guests, tributes, arrived, from, all, over, the, world, typical, was, that, from, the, british, mountaineer, edward, whymper, who, wrote, that, nansen, had, made, almost, as, great, an, advance, as, has, been, accomplished, by, all, other, voyages, in, the, nineteenth, century, put, together, nansen, s, first, task, on, his, return, was, to, write, his, account, of, the, voyage, this, he, did, remarkably, quickly, producing, 300, 000, words, of, norwegian, text, by, november, 1896, the, english, translation, titled, farthest, north, was, ready, in, january, 1897, the, book, was, an, instant, success, and, secured, nansen, s, long, term, financial, future, nansen, included, without, comment, the, one, significant, adverse, criticism, of, his, conduct, that, of, greely, who, had, written, in, harper, s, weekly, on, nansen, s, decision, to, leave, fram, and, strike, for, the, pole, it, passes, comprehension, how, nansen, could, have, thus, deviated, from, the, most, sacred, duty, devolving, on, the, commander, of, a, naval, expedition, during, the, 20, years, following, his, return, from, the, arctic, nansen, devoted, most, of, his, energies, to, scientific, work, in, 1897, he, accepted, a, professorship, in, zoology, at, the, royal, frederick, university, which, gave, him, a, base, from, which, he, could, tackle, the, major, task, of, editing, the, reports, of, the, scientific, results, of, the, fram, expedition, this, was, a, much, more, arduous, task, than, writing, the, expedition, narrative, the, results, were, eventually, published, in, six, volumes, and, according, to, a, later, polar, scientist, robert, rudmose, brown, were, to, arctic, oceanography, what, the, challenger, expedition, results, had, been, to, the, oceanography, of, other, oceans, in, 1900, nansen, became, director, of, the, christiania, based, international, laboratory, for, north, sea, research, and, helped, found, the, international, council, for, the, exploration, of, the, sea, through, his, connection, with, the, latter, body, in, the, summer, of, 1900, nansen, embarked, on, his, first, visit, to, arctic, waters, since, the, fram, expedition, a, cruise, to, iceland, and, jan, mayen, land, on, the, oceanographic, research, vessel, michael, sars, named, after, eva, s, father, shortly, after, his, return, he, learned, that, his, farthest, north, record, had, been, passed, by, members, of, the, duke, of, the, abruzzi, s, italian, expedition, they, had, reached, 86, 34, n, on, 24, april, 1900, in, an, attempt, to, reach, the, north, pole, from, franz, josef, land, nansen, received, the, news, philosophically, what, is, the, value, of, having, goals, for, their, own, sake, they, all, vanish, it, is, merely, a, question, of, time, nansen, was, now, considered, an, oracle, by, all, would, be, explorers, of, the, north, and, south, polar, regions, abruzzi, had, consulted, him, as, had, the, belgian, adrien, de, gerlache, each, of, whom, took, expeditions, to, the, antarctic, although, nansen, refused, to, meet, his, own, countryman, and, fellow, explorer, carsten, borchgrevink, whom, he, considered, a, fraud, he, gave, advice, to, robert, falcon, scott, on, polar, equipment, and, transport, prior, to, the, 1901, 04, discovery, expedition, at, one, point, nansen, seriously, considered, leading, a, south, pole, expedition, himself, and, asked, colin, archer, to, design, two, ships, however, these, plans, remained, on, the, drawing, board, by, 1901, nansen, s, family, had, expanded, considerably, a, daughter, liv, had, been, born, just, before, fram, set, out, a, son, k, re, was, born, in, 1897, followed, by, a, daughter, irmelin, in, 1900, and, a, second, son, odd, in, 1901, the, family, home, which, nansen, had, built, in, 1891, from, the, profits, of, his, greenland, expedition, book, was, now, too, small, nansen, acquired, a, plot, of, land, in, the, lysaker, district, and, built, substantially, to, his, own, design, a, large, and, imposing, house, which, combined, some, of, the, characteristics, of, an, english, manor, house, with, features, from, the, italian, renaissance, the, house, was, ready, for, occupation, by, april, 1902, nansen, called, it, polh, gda, in, english, polar, heights, and, it, remained, his, home, for, the, rest, of, his, life, a, fifth, and, final, child, son, asmund, was, born, at, polh, gda, in, 1903, the, union, between, norway, and, sweden, imposed, by, the, great, powers, in, 1814, had, been, under, considerable, strain, through, the, 1890s, the, chief, issue, in, question, being, norway, s, rights, to, its, own, consular, service, nansen, although, not, by, inclination, a, politician, had, spoken, out, on, the, issue, on, several, occasions, in, defence, of, norway, s, interests, as, of, 1898, nansen, was, among, the, contributors, of, ringeren, an, anti, union, magazine, established, by, sigurd, ibsen, it, seemed, early, in, the, 20th, century, that, agreement, between, the, two, countries, might, be, possible, but, hopes, were, dashed, when, negotiations, broke, down, in, february, 1905, the, norwegian, government, fell, and, was, replaced, by, one, led, by, christian, michelsen, whose, programme, was, one, of, separation, from, sweden, in, february, and, march, nansen, published, a, series, of, newspaper, articles, which, placed, him, firmly, in, the, separatist, camp, the, new, prime, minister, wanted, nansen, in, the, cabinet, but, nansen, had, no, political, ambitions, however, at, michelsen, s, request, he, went, to, berlin, and, then, to, london, where, in, a, letter, to, the, times, he, presented, norway, s, legal, case, for, a, separate, consular, service, to, the, english, speaking, world, on, 17, may, 1905, norway, s, constitution, day, nansen, addressed, a, large, crowd, in, christiania, saying, now, have, all, ways, of, retreat, been, closed, now, remains, only, one, path, the, way, forward, perhaps, through, difficulties, and, hardships, but, forward, for, our, country, to, a, free, norway, he, also, wrote, a, book, norway, and, the, union, with, sweden, to, promote, norway, s, case, abroad, on, 23, may, the, storting, passed, the, consulate, act, establishing, a, separate, consular, service, king, oscar, refused, his, assent, on, 27, may, the, norwegian, cabinet, resigned, but, the, king, would, not, recognise, this, step, on, 7, june, the, storting, unilaterally, announced, that, the, union, with, sweden, was, dissolved, in, a, tense, situation, the, swedish, government, agreed, to, norway, s, request, that, the, dissolution, should, be, put, to, a, referendum, of, the, norwegian, people, this, was, held, on, 13, august, 1905, and, resulted, in, an, overwhelming, vote, for, independence, at, which, point, king, oscar, relinquished, the, crown, of, norway, while, retaining, the, swedish, throne, a, second, referendum, held, in, november, determined, that, the, new, independent, state, should, be, a, monarchy, rather, than, a, republic, in, anticipation, of, this, michelsen, s, government, had, been, considering, the, suitability, of, various, princes, as, candidates, for, the, norwegian, throne, faced, with, king, oscar, s, refusal, to, allow, anyone, from, his, own, house, of, bernadotte, to, accept, the, crown, the, favoured, choice, was, prince, charles, of, denmark, in, july, 1905, michelsen, sent, nansen, to, copenhagen, on, a, secret, mission, to, persuade, charles, to, accept, the, norwegian, throne, nansen, was, successful, shortly, after, the, second, referendum, charles, was, proclaimed, king, taking, the, name, haakon, vii, he, and, his, wife, the, british, princess, maud, were, crowned, in, the, nidaros, cathedral, in, trondheim, on, 22, june, 1906, in, april, 1906, nansen, was, appointed, norway, s, first, minister, in, london, his, main, task, was, to, work, with, representatives, of, the, major, european, powers, on, an, integrity, treaty, which, would, guarantee, norway, s, position, nansen, was, popular, in, england, and, got, on, well, with, king, edward, though, he, found, court, functions, and, diplomatic, duties, disagreeable, frivolous, and, boring, was, his, description, however, he, was, able, to, pursue, his, geographical, and, scientific, interests, through, contacts, with, the, royal, geographical, society, and, other, learned, bodies, the, treaty, was, signed, on, 2, november, 1907, and, nansen, considered, his, task, complete, resisting, the, pleas, of, among, others, king, edward, that, he, should, remain, in, london, on, 15, november, nansen, resigned, his, post, a, few, weeks, later, still, in, england, as, the, king, s, guest, at, sandringham, nansen, received, word, that, eva, was, seriously, ill, with, pneumonia, on, 8, december, he, set, out, for, home, but, before, he, reached, polh, gda, he, learned, from, a, telegram, that, eva, had, died, after, a, period, of, mourning, nansen, returned, to, london, he, had, been, persuaded, by, his, government, to, rescind, his, resignation, until, after, king, edward, s, state, visit, to, norway, in, april, 1908, his, formal, retirement, from, the, diplomatic, service, was, dated, 1, may, 1908, the, same, day, on, which, his, university, professorship, was, changed, from, zoology, to, oceanography, this, new, designation, reflected, the, general, character, of, nansen, s, more, recent, scientific, interests, in, 1905, he, had, supplied, the, swedish, physicist, walfrid, ekman, with, the, data, which, established, the, principle, in, oceanography, known, as, the, ekman, spiral, based, on, nansen, s, observations, of, ocean, currents, recorded, during, the, fram, expedition, ekman, concluded, that, the, effect, of, wind, on, the, sea, s, surface, produced, currents, which, formed, something, like, a, spiral, staircase, down, towards, the, depths, in, 1909, nansen, combined, with, bj, rn, helland, hansen, to, publish, an, academic, paper, the, norwegian, sea, its, physical, oceanography, based, on, the, michael, sars, voyage, of, 1900, nansen, had, by, now, retired, from, polar, exploration, the, decisive, step, being, his, release, of, fram, to, fellow, norwegian, roald, amundsen, who, was, planning, a, north, pole, expedition, when, amundsen, made, his, controversial, change, of, plan, and, set, out, for, the, south, pole, nansen, stood, by, him, between, 1910, and, 1914, nansen, participated, in, several, oceanographic, voyages, in, 1910, aboard, the, norwegian, naval, vessel, fridtjof, he, carried, out, researches, in, the, northern, atlantic, and, in, 1912, he, took, his, own, yacht, veslem, y, to, bear, island, and, spitsbergen, the, main, objective, of, the, veslem, y, cruise, was, the, investigation, of, salinity, in, the, north, polar, basin, one, of, nansen, s, lasting, contributions, to, oceanography, was, his, work, designing, instruments, and, equipment, the, nansen, bottle, for, taking, deep, water, samples, remained, in, use, into, the, 21st, century, in, a, version, updated, by, shale, niskin, at, the, request, of, the, royal, geographical, society, nansen, began, work, on, a, study, of, arctic, discoveries, which, developed, into, a, two, volume, history, of, the, exploration, of, the, northern, regions, up, to, the, beginning, of, the, 16th, century, this, was, published, in, 1911, as, nord, i, t, keheimen, in, northern, mists, that, year, he, renewed, an, acquaintance, with, kathleen, scott, wife, of, robert, falcon, scott, whose, terra, nova, expedition, had, sailed, for, antarctica, in, 1910, biographer, roland, huntford, has, claimed, that, nansen, and, kathleen, scott, had, a, brief, affair, louisa, young, in, her, biography, of, lady, scott, rejects, the, claim, many, women, were, attracted, to, nansen, and, he, had, a, reputation, as, a, womaniser, his, personal, life, was, troubled, around, this, time, in, january, 1913, he, received, news, of, the, suicide, of, hjalmar, johansen, who, had, returned, in, disgrace, from, amundsen, s, successful, south, pole, expedition, in, march, 1913, nansen, s, youngest, son, asmund, died, after, a, long, illness, in, the, summer, of, 1913, nansen, travelled, to, the, kara, sea, by, the, invitation, of, jonas, lied, as, part, of, a, delegation, investigating, a, possible, trade, route, between, western, europe, and, the, siberian, interior, the, party, then, took, a, steamer, up, the, yenisei, river, to, krasnoyarsk, and, travelled, on, the, trans, siberian, railway, to, vladivostok, before, turning, for, home, nansen, published, a, report, from, the, trip, in, through, siberia, the, life, and, culture, of, the, russian, peoples, aroused, in, nansen, an, interest, and, sympathy, he, would, carry, through, to, his, later, life, immediately, before, the, first, world, war, nansen, joined, helland, hansen, in, an, oceanographical, cruise, in, eastern, atlantic, waters, on, the, outbreak, of, war, in, 1914, norway, declared, its, neutrality, alongside, sweden, and, denmark, nansen, was, appointed, as, the, president, of, the, norwegian, union, of, defence, but, had, few, official, duties, and, continued, with, his, professional, work, as, far, as, circumstances, permitted, as, the, war, progressed, the, loss, of, norway, s, overseas, trade, led, to, acute, shortages, of, food, in, the, country, which, became, critical, in, april, 1917, when, the, united, states, entered, the, war, and, placed, extra, restrictions, on, international, trade, nansen, was, dispatched, to, washington, by, the, norwegian, government, after, months, of, discussion, he, secured, food, and, other, supplies, in, return, for, the, introduction, of, a, rationing, system, when, his, government, hesitated, over, the, deal, he, signed, the, agreement, on, his, own, initiative, within, a, few, months, of, the, war, s, end, in, november, 1918, a, draft, agreement, had, been, accepted, by, the, paris, peace, conference, to, create, a, league, of, nations, as, a, means, of, resolving, disputes, between, nations, by, peaceful, means, the, foundation, of, the, league, at, this, time, was, providential, as, far, as, nansen, was, concerned, giving, him, a, new, outlet, for, his, restless, energy, he, became, president, of, the, norwegian, league, of, nations, society, and, although, the, scandinavian, nations, with, their, traditions, of, neutrality, initially, held, themselves, aloof, his, advocacy, helped, to, ensure, that, norway, became, a, full, member, of, the, league, in, 1920, and, he, became, one, of, its, three, delegates, to, the, league, s, general, assembly, in, april, 1920, at, the, league, s, request, nansen, began, organising, the, repatriation, of, around, half, a, million, prisoners, of, war, stranded, in, various, parts, of, the, world, of, these, 300, 000, were, in, russia, which, gripped, by, revolution, and, civil, war, had, little, interest, in, their, fate, nansen, was, able, to, report, to, the, assembly, in, november, 1920, that, around, 200, 000, men, had, been, returned, to, their, homes, never, in, my, life, he, said, have, i, been, brought, into, touch, with, so, formidable, an, amount, of, suffering, nansen, continued, this, work, for, a, further, two, years, until, in, his, final, report, to, the, assembly, in, 1922, he, was, able, to, state, that, 427, 886, prisoners, had, been, repatriated, to, around, 30, different, countries, in, paying, tribute, to, his, work, the, responsible, committee, recorded, that, the, story, of, his, efforts, would, contain, tales, of, heroic, endeavour, worthy, of, those, in, the, accounts, of, the, crossing, of, greenland, and, the, great, arctic, voyage, the, nansen, mission, is, the, colloquial, term, used, by, inhabitants, of, former, soviet, socialist, republics, to, describe, the, series, of, humanitarian, initiatives, undertaken, by, the, international, committee, of, the, red, cross, and, headed, by, fridtjof, nansen, this, international, effort, included, the, involvement, of, the, swiss, swedish, dutch, danish, norwegian, and, german, branches, of, the, red, cross, the, swiss, and, italian, children, s, aids, the, seventh, day, adventist, society, as, well, as, many, other, organisations, the, mobilisation, effort, began, in, august, 1921, and, the, first, programmes, in, russia, began, soon, after, with, the, signing, of, an, agreement, of, assistance, between, nansen, and, georgy, chicherin, which, provided, aid, to, mitigate, starvation, in, russia, and, ukraine, even, before, this, work, was, complete, nansen, was, involved, in, a, further, humanitarian, effort, on, 1, september, 1921, prompted, by, the, british, delegate, philip, noel, baker, he, accepted, the, post, of, the, league, s, high, commissioner, for, refugees, his, main, brief, was, the, resettlement, of, around, two, million, russian, refugees, displaced, by, the, upheavals, of, the, russian, revolution, at, the, same, time, he, tried, to, tackle, the, urgent, problem, of, famine, in, russia, following, a, widespread, failure, of, crops, around, 30, million, people, were, threatened, with, starvation, and, death, despite, nansen, s, pleas, on, behalf, of, the, starving, russia, s, revolutionary, government, was, feared, and, distrusted, internationally, and, the, league, was, reluctant, to, come, to, its, peoples, aid, nansen, had, to, rely, largely, on, fundraising, from, private, organisations, and, his, efforts, met, with, limited, success, later, he, was, to, express, himself, bitterly, on, the, matter, there, was, in, various, transatlantic, countries, such, an, abundance, of, maize, that, the, farmers, had, to, burn, it, as, fuel, in, their, railway, engines, at, the, same, time, the, ships, in, europe, were, idle, for, there, were, no, cargoes, simultaneously, there, were, thousands, nay, millions, of, unemployed, all, this, while, thirty, million, people, in, the, volga, region, not, far, away, and, easily, reached, by, our, ships, were, allowed, to, starve, and, die, the, politicians, of, the, world, at, large, except, in, the, united, states, were, trying, to, find, an, excuse, for, doing, nothing, on, the, pretext, that, it, was, the, russians, own, fault, a, result, of, the, bolshevik, system, a, major, problem, impeding, nansen, s, work, on, behalf, of, refugees, was, that, most, of, them, lacked, documentary, proof, of, identity, or, nationality, without, legal, status, in, their, country, of, refuge, their, lack, of, papers, meant, they, were, unable, to, go, anywhere, else, to, overcome, this, nansen, devised, a, document, that, became, known, as, the, nansen, passport, a, form, of, identity, for, stateless, persons, that, was, in, time, recognised, by, more, than, 50, governments, and, which, allowed, refugees, to, cross, borders, legally, although, the, passport, was, created, initially, for, refugees, from, russia, it, was, extended, to, cover, other, groups, while, attending, the, conference, of, lausanne, in, november, 1922, nansen, learned, that, he, had, been, awarded, the, nobel, peace, prize, for, 1922, the, citation, referred, to, his, work, for, the, repatriation, of, the, prisoners, of, war, his, work, for, the, russian, refugees, his, work, to, bring, succour, to, the, millions, of, russians, afflicted, by, famine, and, finally, his, present, work, for, the, refugees, in, asia, minor, and, thrace, nansen, donated, the, prize, money, to, international, relief, efforts, after, the, greco, turkish, war, of, 1919, 1922, nansen, travelled, to, constantinople, to, negotiate, the, resettlement, of, hundreds, of, thousands, of, refugees, mainly, ethnic, greeks, who, had, fled, from, turkey, after, the, defeat, of, the, greek, army, the, impoverished, greek, state, was, unable, to, take, them, in, and, so, nansen, devised, a, scheme, for, a, population, exchange, whereby, half, a, million, turks, in, greece, were, returned, to, turkey, with, full, financial, compensation, while, further, loans, facilitated, the, absorption, of, the, refugee, greeks, into, their, homeland, despite, some, controversy, over, the, principle, of, a, population, exchange, the, plan, was, implemented, successfully, over, a, period, of, several, years, from, 1925, onwards, nansen, devoted, much, time, trying, to, help, armenian, refugees, victims, of, armenian, genocide, at, the, hands, of, the, ottoman, empire, during, the, first, world, war, and, further, ill, treatment, thereafter, his, goal, was, the, establishment, of, a, national, home, for, these, refugees, within, the, borders, of, soviet, armenia, his, main, assistant, in, this, endeavour, was, vidkun, quisling, the, future, nazi, collaborator, and, head, of, a, norwegian, puppet, government, during, the, second, world, war, after, visiting, the, region, nansen, presented, the, assembly, with, a, modest, plan, for, the, irrigation, of, 360, square, kilometres, 140, sq, mi, on, which, 15, 000, refugees, could, be, settled, the, plan, ultimately, failed, because, even, with, nansen, s, unremitting, advocacy, the, money, to, finance, the, scheme, was, not, forthcoming, despite, this, failure, his, reputation, among, the, armenian, people, remains, high, nansen, wrote, armenia, and, the, near, east, 1923, wherein, he, describes, the, plight, of, the, armenians, in, the, wake, of, losing, its, independence, to, the, soviet, union, the, book, was, translated, into, many, languages, after, his, visit, to, armenia, nansen, wrote, two, additional, books, across, armenia, 1927, and, through, the, caucasus, to, the, volga, 1930, within, the, league, s, assembly, nansen, spoke, out, on, many, issues, besides, those, related, to, refugees, he, believed, that, the, assembly, gave, the, smaller, countries, such, as, norway, a, unique, opportunity, for, speaking, in, the, councils, of, the, world, he, believed, that, the, extent, of, the, league, s, success, in, reducing, armaments, would, be, the, greatest, test, of, its, credibility, he, was, a, signatory, to, the, slavery, convention, of, 25, september, 1926, which, sought, to, outlaw, the, use, of, forced, labour, he, supported, a, settlement, of, the, post, war, reparations, issue, and, championed, germany, s, membership, of, the, league, which, was, granted, in, september, 1926, after, intensive, preparatory, work, by, nansen, on, 17, january, 1919, nansen, married, sigrun, munthe, a, long, time, friend, with, whom, he, had, had, a, love, affair, in, 1905, while, eva, was, still, alive, the, marriage, was, resented, by, the, nansen, children, and, proved, unhappy, an, acquaintance, writing, of, them, in, the, 1920s, said, nansen, appeared, unbearably, miserable, and, sigrun, steeped, in, hate, nansen, s, league, of, nations, commitments, through, the, 1920s, meant, that, he, was, mostly, absent, from, norway, and, was, able, to, devote, little, time, to, scientific, work, nevertheless, he, continued, to, publish, occasional, papers, he, entertained, the, hope, that, he, might, travel, to, the, north, pole, by, airship, but, could, not, raise, sufficient, funding, in, any, event, he, was, forestalled, in, this, ambition, by, amundsen, who, flew, over, the, pole, in, umberto, nobile, s, airship, norge, in, may, 1926, two, years, later, nansen, broadcast, a, memorial, oration, to, amundsen, who, had, disappeared, in, the, arctic, while, organising, a, rescue, party, for, nobile, whose, airship, had, crashed, during, a, second, polar, voyage, nansen, said, of, amundsen, he, found, an, unknown, grave, under, the, clear, sky, of, the, icy, world, with, the, whirring, of, the, wings, of, eternity, through, space, in, 1926, nansen, was, elected, rector, of, the, university, of, st, andrews, in, scotland, the, first, foreigner, to, hold, this, largely, honorary, position, he, used, the, occasion, of, his, inaugural, address, to, review, his, life, and, philosophy, and, to, deliver, a, call, to, the, youth, of, the, next, generation, he, ended, we, all, have, a, land, of, beyond, to, seek, in, our, life, what, more, can, we, ask, our, part, is, to, find, the, trail, that, leads, to, it, a, long, trail, a, hard, trail, maybe, but, the, call, comes, to, us, and, we, have, to, go, rooted, deep, in, the, nature, of, every, one, of, us, is, the, spirit, of, adventure, the, call, of, the, wild, vibrating, under, all, our, actions, making, life, deeper, and, higher, and, nobler, nansen, largely, avoided, involvement, in, domestic, norwegian, politics, but, in, 1924, he, was, persuaded, by, the, long, retired, former, prime, minister, christian, michelsen, to, take, part, in, a, new, anti, communist, political, grouping, the, fatherland, league, there, were, fears, in, norway, that, should, the, marxist, oriented, labour, party, gain, power, it, would, introduce, a, revolutionary, programme, at, the, inaugural, rally, of, the, league, in, oslo, as, christiania, had, now, been, renamed, nansen, declared, to, talk, of, the, right, of, revolution, in, a, society, with, full, civil, liberty, universal, suffrage, equal, treatment, for, everyone, idiotic, nonsense, following, continued, turmoil, between, the, centre, right, parties, there, was, even, an, independent, petition, in, 1926, gaining, some, momentum, that, proposed, for, nansen, to, head, a, centre, right, national, unity, government, on, a, balanced, budget, program, an, idea, he, did, not, reject, he, was, the, headline, speaker, at, the, single, largest, fatherland, league, rally, with, 15, 000, attendees, in, t, nsberg, in, 1928, in, 1929, he, went, on, his, final, tour, for, the, league, on, the, ship, stella, polaris, holding, speeches, from, bergen, to, hammerfest, in, between, his, various, duties, and, responsibilities, nansen, had, continued, to, take, skiing, holidays, when, he, could, in, february, 1930, aged, 68, he, took, a, short, break, in, the, mountains, with, two, old, friends, who, noted, that, nansen, was, slower, than, usual, and, appeared, to, tire, easily, on, his, return, to, oslo, he, was, laid, up, for, several, months, with, influenza, and, later, phlebitis, and, was, visited, on, his, sickbed, by, king, haakon, vii, nansen, was, a, close, friend, of, a, clergyman, named,

and, thereafter, nansen, received, honours, and, recognition, from, many, countries, among, the, many, tributes, paid, to, him, subsequently, was, that, of, lord, robert, cecil, a, fellow, league, of, nations, delegate, who, spoke, of, the, range, of, nansen, s, work, done, with, no, regard, for, his, own, interests, or, health, every, good, cause, had, his, support, he, was, a, fearless, peacemaker, a, friend, of, justice, an, advocate, always, for, the, weak, and, suffering, nansen, was, a, pioneer, and, innovator, in, many, fields, as, a, young, man, he, embraced, the, revolution, in, skiing, methods, that, transformed, it, from, a, means, of, winter, travel, to, a, universal, sport, and, quickly, became, one, of, norway, s, leading, skiers, he, was, later, able, to, apply, this, expertise, to, the, problems, of, polar, travel, in, both, his, greenland, and, his, fram, expeditions, he, invented, the, nansen, sledge, with, broad, ski, like, runners, the, nansen, cooker,

replaced, by, layers, of, lightweight, material, in, science, nansen, is, recognised, both, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, neurology, and, as, a, significant, contributor, to, early,

refugees, from, the, european, dictatorships, during, the, 1930s, nevertheless, it, secured, the, agreement, of, 14, countries, including, a, reluctant, great, britain, to, the, refugee, convention,
