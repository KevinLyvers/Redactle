installments, that, they, published, in, book, form, the, audience, for, these, serialized, novels, was, largely, made, up, of, middle, class, women, and, james, struggled, to, fashion, serious,

french, poets, and, novelists, 1878, hawthorne, 1879, and, several, shorter, works, of, fiction, in, 1878, daisy, miller, established, his, fame, on, both, sides, of, the, atlantic, it, drew, notice, perhaps, mostly, because, it, depicted, a, woman, whose, behavior, is, outside, the, social, norms, of, europe, he, also, began, his, first, masterpiece, the, portrait, of, a, lady, which, appeared, in, 1881, in, 1877, he, first, visited, wenlock, abbey, in, shropshire, home, of, his, friend, charles, milnes, gaskell, whom, he, had, met, through, henry, adams, he, was, much, inspired, by, the, darkly, romantic, abbey, and, the, surrounding, countryside, which, feature, in, his, essay, abbeys, and, castles, in, particular, the, gloomy, monastic, fishponds, behind, the, abbey, are, said, to, have, inspired, the, lake, in, the, turn, of, the, screw, while, living, in, london, james, continued, to, follow, the, careers, of, the, french, realists, mile, zola, in, particular, their,

his, father, emerson, an, old, family, friend, died, in, 1882, his, brother, wilkie, and, friend, turgenev, both, died, in, 1883, in, 1884, james, made, another, visit, to, paris, where, he, met,

published, the, bostonians, and, the, princess, casamassima, both, influenced, by, the, french, writers, that, he, had, studied, assiduously, critical, reaction, and, sales, were, poor, he, wrote, to, howells, that, the, books, had, hurt, his, career, rather, than, helped, because, they, had, reduced, the, desire, and, demand, for, my, productions, to, zero, during, this, time, he, became, friends, with, robert, louis, stevenson, john, singer, sargent, edmund, gosse, george, du, maurier, paul, bourget, and, constance, fenimore, woolson, his, third, novel, from, the, 1880s, was, the, tragic, muse, although, he, was, following, the, precepts, of, zola, in, his, novels, of, the, 80s, their, tone, and, attitude, are, closer, to, the, fiction, of, alphonse, daudet, the, lack, of, critical, and, financial, success, for, his, novels, during, this, period, led, him, to, try, writing, for, the, theatre, his, dramatic, works, and, his, experiences, with, theatre, are, discussed, below, in, the, last, quarter, of, 1889, for, pure, and, copious, lucre, he, started, translating, port, tarascon, the, third, volume, of, daudet, s, adventures, of, tartarin, de, tarascon, serialized, in, harper, s, monthly, from, june, 1890, this, translation, praised, as, clever, by, the, spectator, was, published, in, january, 1891, by, sampson, low, marston, searle, rivington, after, the, stage, failure, of, guy, domville, in, 1895, james, was, near, despair, and, thoughts, of, death, plagued, him, his, depression, was, compounded, by, the, deaths, of, those, closest, to, him, including, his, sister, alice, in, 1892, his, friend, wolcott, balestier, in, 1891, and, stevenson, and, fenimore, woolson, in, 1894, the, sudden, death, of, fenimore, woolson, in, january, 1894, and, the, speculations, of, suicide, surrounding, her, death, were, particularly, painful, for, him, leon, edel, wrote, that, the, reverberations, from, fenimore, woolson, s, death, were, such, that, we, can, read, a, strong, element, of, guilt, and, bewilderment, in, his, letters, and, even, more, in, those, extraordinary, tales, of, the, next, half, dozen, years, the, altar, of, the, dead, and, the, beast, in, the, jungle, the, years, spent, on, dramatic, works, were, not, entirely, a, loss, as, he, moved, into, the, last, phase, of, his, career, he, found, ways, to, adapt, dramatic, techniques, into, the, novel, form, in, the, late, 1880s, and, throughout, the, 1890s, james, made, several, trips, through, europe, he, spent, a, long, stay, in, italy, in, 1887, in, 1888, he, published, the,

suggestions, that, he, should, marry, and, after, settling, in, london, proclaimed, himself, a, bachelor, f, w, dupee, in, several, volumes, on, the, james, family, originated, the, theory, that, he, had, been, in, love, with, his, cousin, mary, minnie, temple, but, that, a, neurotic, fear, of, sex, kept, him, from, admitting, such, affections, james, s, invalidism, was, itself, the, symptom, of, some, fear, of, or, scruple, against, sexual, love, on, his, part, dupee, used, an, episode, from, james, s, memoir, a, small, boy, and, others, recounting, a, dream, of, a, napoleonic, image, in, the, louvre, to, exemplify, james, s, romanticism, about, europe, a, napoleonic, fantasy, into, which, he, fled, between, 1953, and, 1972, leon, edel, wrote, a, major, five, volume, biography, of, james, which, used, unpublished, letters, and, documents, after, edel, gained, the, permission, of, james, s, family, edel, s, portrayal, of, james, included, the, suggestion, he, was, celibate, a, view, first, propounded, by, critic, saul, rosenzweig, in, 1943, in, 1996, sheldon, m, novick, published, henry, james, the, young, master, followed, by, henry, james, the, mature, master, 2007, the, first, book, caused, something, of, an, uproar, in, jamesian, circles, as, it, challenged, the, previous, received, notion, of, celibacy, a, once, familiar, paradigm, in, biographies, of, homosexuals, when, direct, evidence, was, nonexistent, novick, also, criticized, edel, for, following, the, discounted, freudian, interpretation, of, homosexuality, as, a, kind, of, failure, the, difference, of, opinion, erupted, in, a, series, of, exchanges, between, edel, and, later, fred, kaplan, filling, in, for, edel, and, novick, which, were, published, by, the, online, magazine, slate, with, novick, arguing, that, even, the, suggestion, of, celibacy, went, against, james, s, own, injunction, live, not, fantasize, a, letter, james, wrote, in, old, age, to, hugh, walpole, has, been, cited, as, an, explicit, statement, of, this, walpole, confessed, to, him, of, indulging, in, high, jinks, and, james, wrote, a, reply, endorsing, it, we, must, know, as, much, as, possible, in, our, beautiful, art, yours, mine, what, we, are, talking, about, the, only, way, to, know, it, is, to, have, lived, loved, cursed, floundered, enjoyed, suffered, i, don, t, think, i, regret, a, single, excess, of, my, responsive, youth, the, interpretation, of, james, as, living, a, less, austere, emotional, life, has, been, subsequently, explored, by, other, scholars, the, often, intense, politics, of, jamesian, scholarship, has, also, been, the, subject, of, studies, author, colm, t, ib, n, has, said, that, eve, kosofsky, sedgwick, s, epistemology, of, the, closet, made, a, landmark, difference, to, jamesian, scholarship, by, arguing, that, he, be, read, as, a, homosexual, writer, whose, desire, to, keep, his, sexuality, a, secret, shaped, his, layered, style, and, dramatic, artistry, according, to, t, ib, n, such, a, reading, removed, james, from, the, realm, of, dead, white, males, who, wrote, about, posh, people, he, became, our, contemporary, james, s, letters, to, expatriate, american, sculptor, hendrik, christian, andersen, have, attracted, particular, attention, james, met, the, 27, year, old, andersen, in, rome, in, 1899, when, james, was, 56, and, wrote, letters, to, andersen, that, are, intensely, emotional, i, hold, you, dearest, boy, in, my, innermost, love, count, on, your, feeling, me, in, every, throb, of, your, soul, in, a, letter, of, 6, may, 1904, to, his, brother, william, james, referred, to, himself, as, always, your, hopelessly, celibate, even, though, sexagenarian, henry, how, accurate, that, description, might, have, been, is, the, subject, of, contention, among, james, s, biographers, but, the, letters, to, andersen, were, occasionally, quasierotic, i, put, my, dear, boy, my, arm, around, you, feel, the, pulsation, thereby, as, it, were, of, our, excellent, future, your, admirable, endowment, his, numerous, letters, to, the, many, young, homosexual, men, among, his, close, male, friends, are, more, forthcoming, to, his, homosexual, friend, howard, sturgis, james, could, write, i, repeat, almost, to, indiscretion, that, i, could, live, with, you, meanwhile, i, can, only, try, to, live, without, you, in, another, letter, sturgis, following, a, long, visit, james, refers, jocularly, to, their, happy, little, congress, of, two, in, letters, to, hugh, walpole, he, pursues, convoluted, jokes, and, puns, about, their, relationship, referring, to, himself, as, an, elephant, who, paws, you, oh, so, benevolently, and, winds, about, walpole, his, well, meaning, old, trunk, his, letters, to, walter, berry, printed, by, the, black, sun, press, have, long, been, celebrated, for, their, lightly, veiled, eroticism, however, james, corresponded, in, equally, extravagant, language, with, his, many, female, friends, writing, for, example, to, fellow, novelist, lucy, clifford, dearest, lucy, what, shall, i, say, when, i, love, you, so, very, very, much, and, see, you, nine, times, for, once, that, i, see, others, therefore, i, think, that, if, you, want, it, made, clear, to, the, meanest, intelligence, i, love, you, more, than, i, love, others, to, his, new, york, friend, mary, cadwalader, rawle, jones, dearest, mary, cadwalader, i, yearn, over, you, but, i, yearn, in, vain, your, long, silence, really, breaks, my, heart, mystifies, depresses, almost, alarms, me, to, the, point, even, of, making, me, wonder, if,

intimes, hours, those, telephonic, matin, es, as, the, most, romantic, of, his, life, his, long, friendship, with, american, novelist, constance, fenimore, woolson, in, whose, house, he, lived, for, a, number, of, weeks, in, italy, in, 1887, and, his, shock, and, grief, over, her, suicide, in, 1894, are, discussed, in, detail, in, edel, s, biography, and, play, a, central, role, in, a, study, by, lyndall, gordon, edel, conjectured, that, woolson, was, in, love, with, james, and, killed, herself, in, part, because, of, his, coldness, but, woolson, s, biographers, have, objected, to, edel, s, account, james, is, one, of, the, major, figures, of, trans, atlantic, literature, his, works, frequently, juxtapose, characters, from, the, old, world, europe, embodying, a, feudal, civilisation, that, is, beautiful, often, corrupt, and, alluring, and, from, the, new, world, united, states, where, people, are, often, brash, open, and, assertive, and, embody, the, virtues, of, the, new, american, society, particularly, personal, freedom, and, a, more, exacting, moral, character, james, explores, this, clash, of, personalities, and, cultures, in, stories, of, personal, relationships, in, which, power, is, exercised, well, or, badly, his, protagonists, were, often, young, american, women, facing, oppression, or, abuse, and, as, his, secretary, theodora, bosanquet, remarked, in, her, monograph, henry, james, at, work, when, he, walked, out, of, the, refuge, of, his, study, and, into, the, world, and, looked, around, him, he, saw, a, place, of, torment, where, creatures, of, prey, perpetually, thrust, their, claws, into, the, quivering, flesh, of, doomed, defenseless, children, of, light, his, novels, are, a, repeated, exposure, of, this, wickedness, a, reiterated, and, passionate, plea, for, the, fullest, freedom, of, development, unimperiled, by, reckless, and, barbarous, stupidity, philip, guedalla, jokingly, described, three, phases, in, the, development, of, james, s, prose, james, i, james, ii, and, the, old, pretender, and, observers, do, often, group, his, works, of, fiction, into, three, periods, in, his, apprentice, years, culminating, with, the, masterwork, the, portrait, of, a, lady, his, style, was, simple, and, direct, by, the, standards, of, victorian, magazine, writing, and, he, experimented, widely, with, forms, and, methods, generally, narrating, from, a, conventionally, omniscient, point, of, view, plots, generally, concern, romance, except, for, the, three, big, novels, of, social, commentary, that, conclude, this, period, in, the, second, period, as, noted, above, he, abandoned, the, serialized, novel, and, from, 1890, to, about, 1897, he, wrote, short, stories, and, plays, finally, in, his, third, and, last, period, he, returned, to, the, long, serialised, novel, beginning, in, the, second, period, but, most, noticeably, in, the, third, he, increasingly, abandoned, direct, statement, in, favour, of, frequent, double, negatives, and, complex, descriptive, imagery, single, paragraphs, began, to, run, for, page, after, page, in, which, an, initial, noun, would, be, succeeded, by, pronouns, surrounded, by, clouds, of, adjectives, and, prepositional, clauses, far, from, their, original, referents, and, verbs, would, be, deferred, and, then, preceded, by, a, series, of, adverbs, the, overall, effect, could, be, a, vivid, evocation, of, a, scene, as, perceived, by, a, sensitive, observer, it, has, been, debated, whether, this, change, of, style, was, engendered, by, james, s, shifting, from, writing, to, dictating, to, a, typist, a, change, made, during, the, composition, of, what, maisie, knew, in, its, intense, focus, on, the, consciousness, of, his, major, characters, james, s, later, work, foreshadows, extensive, developments, in, 20th, century, fiction, indeed, he, might, have, influenced, stream, of, consciousness, writers, such, as, virginia, woolf, who, not, only, read, some, of, his, novels, but, also, wrote, essays, about, them, both, contemporary, and, modern, readers, have, found, the, late, style, difficult, and, unnecessary, his, friend, edith, wharton, who, admired, him, greatly, said, that, some, passages, in, his, work, were, all, but, incomprehensible, james, was, harshly, portrayed, by, h, g, wells, as, a, hippopotamus, laboriously, attempting, to, pick, up, a, pea, that, had, got, into, a, corner, of, its, cage, the, late, james, style, was, ably, parodied, by, max, beerbohm, in, the, mote, in, the, middle, distance, more, important, for, his, work, overall, may, have, been, his, position, as, an, expatriate, and, in, other, ways, an, outsider, living, in, europe, while, he, came, from, middle, class, and, provincial, beginnings, seen, from, the, perspective, of, european, polite, society, he, worked, very, hard, to, gain, access, to, all, levels, of, society, and, the, settings, of, his, fiction, range, from, working, class, to, aristocratic, and, often, describe, the, efforts, of, middle, class, americans, to, make, their, way, in, european, capitals, he, confessed, he, got, some, of, his, best, story, ideas, from, gossip, at, the, dinner, table, or, at, country, house, weekends, he, worked, for, a, living, however, and, lacked, the, experiences, of, select, schools, university, and, army, service, the, common, bonds, of, masculine, society, he, was, furthermore, a, man, whose, tastes, and, interests, were, according, to, the, prevailing, standards, of, victorian, era, anglo, american, culture, rather, feminine, and, who, was, shadowed, by, the, cloud, of, prejudice, that, then, and, later, accompanied, suspicions, of, his, homosexuality, edmund, wilson, compared, james, s, objectivity, to, shakespeare, s, one, would, be, in, a, position, to, appreciate, james, better, if, one, compared, him, with, the, dramatists, of, the, seventeenth, century, racine, and, moli, re, whom, he, resembles, in, form, as, well, as, in, point, of, view, and, even, shakespeare, when, allowances, are, made, for, the, most, extreme, differences, in, subject, and, form, these, poets, are, not, like, dickens, and, hardy, writers, of, melodrama, either, humorous, or, pessimistic, nor, secretaries, of, society, like, balzac, nor, prophets, like, tolstoy, they, are, occupied, simply, with, the, presentation, of, conflicts, of, moral, character, which, they, do, not, concern, themselves, about, softening, or, averting, they, do, not, indict, society, for, these, situations, they, regard, them, as, universal, and, inevitable, they, do, not, even, blame, god, for, allowing, them, they, accept, them, as, the, conditions, of, life, many, of, james, s, stories, may, also, be, seen, as, psychological, thought, experiments, about, selection, in, his, preface, to, the, new, york, edition, of, the, american, james, describes, the, development, of, the, story, in, his, mind, as, exactly, such, the, situation, of, an, american, some, robust, but, insidiously, beguiled, and, betrayed, some, cruelly, wronged, compatriot, with, the, focus, of, the, story, being, on, the, response, of, this, wronged, man, the, portrait, of, a, lady, may, be, an, experiment, to, see, what, happens, when, an, idealistic, young, woman, suddenly, becomes, very, rich, in, many, of, his, tales, characters, seem, to, exemplify, alternative, futures, and, possibilities, as, most, markedly, in, the, jolly, corner, in, which, the, protagonist, and, a, ghost, doppelganger, live, alternative, american, and, european, lives, and, in, others, like, the, ambassadors, an, older, james, seems, fondly, to, regard, his, own, younger, self, facing, a, crucial, moment, the, first, period, of, james, s, fiction, usually, considered, to, have, culminated, in, the, portrait, of, a, lady, concentrated, on, the, contrast, between, europe, and, america, the, style, of, these, novels, is, generally, straightforward, and, though, personally, characteristic, well, within, the, norms, of, 19th, century, fiction, roderick, hudson, 1875, is, a, k, nstlerroman, that, traces, the, development, of, the, title, character, an, extremely, talented, sculptor, although, the, book, shows, some, signs, of, immaturity, this, was, james, s, first, serious, attempt, at, a, full, length, novel, it, has, attracted, favourable, comment, due, to, the, vivid, realisation, of, the, three, major, characters, roderick, hudson, superbly, gifted, but, unstable, and, unreliable, rowland, mallet, roderick, s, limited, but, much, more, mature, friend, and, patron, and, christina, light, one, of, james, s, most, enchanting, and, maddening, femmes, fatales, the, pair, of, hudson, and, mallet, has, been, seen, as, representing, the, two, sides, of, james, s, own, nature, the, wildly, imaginative, artist, and, the, brooding, conscientious, mentor, in, the, portrait, of, a, lady, 1881, james, concluded, the, first, phase, of, his, career, with, a, novel, that, remains, his, most, popular, piece, of, long, fiction, the, story, is, of, a, spirited, young, american, woman, isabel, archer, who, affronts, her, destiny, and, finds, it, overwhelming, she, inherits, a, large, amount, of, money, and, subsequently, becomes, the, victim, of, machiavellian, scheming, by, two, american, expatriates, the, narrative, is, set, mainly, in, europe, especially, in, england, and, italy, generally, regarded, as, the, masterpiece, of, his, early, phase, the, portrait, of, a, lady, is, described, as, a, psychological, novel, exploring, the, minds, of, his, characters, and, almost, a, work, of, social, science, exploring, the, differences, between, europeans, and, americans, the, old, and, the, new, worlds, the, second, period, of, james, s, career, which, extends, from, the, publication, of, the, portrait, of, a, lady, through, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, features, less, popular, novels, including, the, princess, casamassima, published, serially, in, the, atlantic, monthly, in, 1885, 1886, and, the, bostonians, published, serially, in, the, century, during, the, same, period, this, period, also, featured, james, s, celebrated, gothic, novella, the, turn, of, the, screw, 1898, the, third, period, of, james, s, career, reached, its, most, significant, achievement, in, three, novels, published, just, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, the, wings, of, the, dove, 1902, the, ambassadors, 1903, and, the, golden, bowl, 1904, critic, f, o, matthiessen, called, this, trilogy, james, s, major, phase, and, these, novels, have, certainly, received, intense, critical, study, the, second, written, of, the, books, the, wings, of, the, dove, was, the, first, published, because, it, was, not, serialized, this, novel, tells, the, story, of, milly, theale, an, american, heiress, stricken, with, a, serious, disease, and, her, impact, on, the, people, around, her, some, of, these, people, befriend, milly, with, honourable, motives, while, others, are, more, self, interested, james, stated, in, his, autobiographical, books, that, milly, was, based, on, minny, temple, his, beloved, cousin, who, died, at, an, early, age, of, tuberculosis, he, said, that, he, attempted, in, the, novel, to, wrap, her, memory, in, the, beauty, and, dignity, of, art, james, was, particularly, interested, in, what, he, called, the, beautiful, and, blest, nouvelle, or, the, longer, form, of, short, narrative, still, he, produced, a, number, of, very, short, stories, in, which, he, achieved, notable, compression, of, sometimes, complex, subjects, the, following, narratives, are, representative, of, james, s, achievement, in, the, shorter, forms, of, fiction, at, several, points, in, his, career, james, wrote, plays, beginning, with, one, act, plays, written, for, periodicals, in, 1869, and, 1871, and, a, dramatisation, of, his, popular, novella, daisy, miller, in, 1882, from, 1890, to, 1892, having, received, a, bequest, that, freed, him, from, magazine, publication, he, made, a, strenuous, effort, to, succeed, on, the, london, stage, writing, a, half, dozen, plays, of, which, only, one, a, dramatisation, of, his, novel, the, american, was, produced, this, play, was, performed, for, several, years, by, a, touring, repertory, company, and, had, a, respectable, run, in, london, but, did, not, earn, very, much, money, for, james, his, other, plays, written, at, this, time, were, not, produced, in, 1893, however, he, responded, to, a, request, from, actor, manager, george, alexander, for, a, serious, play, for, the, opening, of, his, renovated, st, james, s, theatre, and, wrote, a, long, drama, guy, domville, which, alexander, produced, a, noisy, uproar, arose, on, the, opening, night, 5, january, 1895, with, hissing, from, the, gallery, when, james, took, his, bow, after, the, final, curtain, and, the, author, was, upset, the, play, received, moderately, good, reviews, and, had, a, modest, run, of, four, weeks, before, being, taken, off, to, make, way, for, oscar, wilde, s, the, importance, of, being, earnest, which, alexander, thought, would, have, better, prospects, for, the, coming, season, after, the, stresses, and, disappointment, of, these, efforts, james, insisted, that, he, would, write, no, more, for, the, theatre, but, within, weeks, had, agreed, to, write, a, curtain, raiser, for, ellen, terry, this, became, the, one, act, summersoft, which, he, later, rewrote, into, a, short, story, covering, end, and, then, expanded, into, a, full, length, play, the, high, bid, which, had, a, brief, run, in, london, in, 1907, when, james, made, another, concerted, effort, to, write, for, the, stage, he, wrote, three, new, plays, two, of, which, were, in, production, when, the, death, of, edward, vii, on, 6, may, 1910, plunged, london, into, mourning, and, theatres, closed, discouraged, by, failing, health, and, the, stresses, of, theatrical, work, james, did, not, renew, his, efforts, in, the, theatre, but, recycled, his, plays, as, successful, novels, the, outcry, was, a, best, seller, in, the, united, states, when, it, was, published, in, 1911, during, 1890, 1893, when, he, was, most, engaged, with, the, theatre, james, wrote, a, good, deal, of, theatrical, criticism, and, assisted, elizabeth, robins, and, others, in, translating, and, producing, henrik, ibsen, for, the, first, time, in, london, leon, edel, argued, in, his, psychoanalytic, biography, that, james, was, traumatised, by, the, opening, night, uproar, that, greeted, guy, domville, and, that, it, plunged, him, into, a, prolonged, depression, the, successful, later, novels, in, edel, s, view, were, the, result, of, a, kind, of, self, analysis, expressed, in, fiction, which, partly, freed, him, from, his, fears, other, biographers, and, scholars, have, not, accepted, this, account, with, the, more, common, view, being, that, of, f, o, matthiessen, who, wrote, instead, of, being, crushed, by, the, collapse, of, his, hopes, he, felt, a, resurgence, of, new, energy, beyond, his, fiction, james, was, one, of, the, more, important, literary, critics, in, the, history, of, the, novel, in, his, classic, essay, the, art, of, fiction, 1884, he, argued, against, rigid, prescriptions, on, the, novelist, s, choice, of, subject, and, method, of, treatment, he, maintained, that, the, widest, possible, freedom, in, content, and, approach, would, help, ensure, narrative, fiction, s, continued, vitality, james, wrote, many, critical, articles, on, other, novelists, typical, is, his, book, length, study, of, nathaniel, hawthorne, which, has, been, the, subject, of, critical, debate, richard, brodhead, has, suggested, that, the, study, was, emblematic, of, james, s, struggle, with, hawthorne, s, influence, and, constituted, an, effort, to, place, the, elder, writer, at, a, disadvantage, gordon, fraser, meanwhile, has, suggested, that, the, study, was, part, of, a, more, commercial, effort, by, james, to, introduce, himself, to, british, readers, as, hawthorne, s, natural, successor, when, james, assembled, the, new, york, edition, of, his, fiction, in, his, final, years, he, wrote, a, series, of, prefaces, that, subjected, his, own, work, to, searching, occasionally, harsh, criticism, at, 22, james, wrote, the, noble, school, of, fiction, for, the, nation, s, first, issue, in, 1865, he, wrote, in, all, over, 200, essays, and, book, art, and, theatre, reviews, for, the, magazine, for, most, of, his, life, james, harboured, ambitions, for, success, as, a, playwright, he, converted, his, novel, the, american, into, a, play, that, enjoyed, modest, returns, in, the, early, 1890s, in, all, he, wrote, about, a, dozen, plays, most, of, which, went, unproduced, his, costume, drama, guy, domville, failed, disastrously, on, its, opening, night, in, 1895, james, then, largely, abandoned, his, efforts, to, conquer, the, stage, and, returned, to, his, fiction, in, his, notebooks, he, maintained, that, his, theatrical, experiment, benefited, his, novels, and, tales, by, helping, him, dramatise, his, characters, thoughts, and, emotions, james, produced, a, small, amount, of, theatrical, criticism, including, appreciations, of, henrik, ibsen, with, his, wide, ranging, artistic, interests, james, occasionally, wrote, on, the, visual, arts, he, wrote, a, favourable, assessment, of, fellow, expatriate, john, singer, sargent, a, painter, whose, critical, status, has, improved, markedly, since, the, mid, twentieth, century, james, also, wrote, sometimes, charming, sometimes, brooding, articles, about, various, places, where, he, visited, and, lived, his, books, of, travel, writing, include, italian, hours, an, example, of, the, charming, approach, and, the, american, scene, on, the, brooding, side, james, was, one, of, the, great, letter, writers, of, any, era, more, than, 10, 000, of, his, personal, letters, are, extant, and, over, 3, 000, have, been, published, in, a, large, number, of, collections, a, complete, edition, of, james, s, letters, began, publication, in, 2006, edited, by, pierre, walker, and, greg, zacharias, as, of, 2014, eight, volumes, have, been, published, covering, from, 1855, to, 1880, james, s, correspondents, included, contemporaries, such, as, robert, louis, stevenson, edith, wharton, and, joseph, conrad, along, with, many, others, in, his, wide, circle, of, friends, and, acquaintances, the, content, of, the, letters, range, from, trivialities, to, serious, discussions, of, artistic, social, and, personal, issues, very, late, in, life, james, began, a, series, of, autobiographical, works, a, small, boy, and, others, notes, of, a, son, and, brother, and, the, unfinished, the, middle, years, these, books, portray, the, development, of, a, classic, observer, who, was, passionately, interested, in, artistic, creation, but, was, somewhat, reticent, about, participating, fully, in, the, life, around, him, james, s, work, has, remained, steadily, popular, with, the, limited, audience, of, educated, readers, to, whom, he, spoke, during, his, lifetime, and, has, remained, firmly, in, the, canon, but, after, his, death, some, american, critics, such, as, van, wyck, brooks, expressed, hostility, towards, james, for, his, long, expatriation, and, eventual, naturalisation, as, a, british, subject, other, critics, such, as, e, m, forster, complained, about, what, they, saw, as, james, s, squeamishness, in, the, treatment, of, sex, and, other, possibly, controversial, material, or, dismissed, his, late, style, as, difficult, and, obscure, relying, heavily, on, extremely, long, sentences, and, excessively, latinate, language, even, in, his, lifetime, explains, scholar, hazel, hutchinson, james, had, a, reputation, as, a, difficult, writer, for, clever, readers, oscar, wilde, criticised, him, for, writing, fiction, as, if, it, were, a, painful, duty, vernon, parrington, composing, a, canon, of, american, literature, condemned, james, for, having, cut, himself, off, from, america, jorge, luis, borges, wrote, about, him, despite, the, scruples, and, delicate, complexities, of, james, his, work, suffers, from, a, major, defect, the, absence, of, life, and, virginia, woolf, writing, to, lytton, strachey, asked, please, tell, me, what, you, find, in, henry, james, we, have, his, works, here, and, i, read, and, i, can, t, find, anything, but, faintly, tinged, rose, water, urbane, and, sleek, but, vulgar, and, pale, as, walter, lamb, is, there, really, any, sense, in, it, novelist, w, somerset, maugham, wrote, he, did, not, know, the, english, as, an, englishman, instinctively, knows, them, and, so, his, english, characters, never, to, my, mind, quite, ring, true, and, argued, the, great, novelists, even, in, seclusion, have, lived, life, passionately, henry, james, was, content, to, observe, it, from, a, window, maugham, nevertheless, wrote, the, fact, remains, that, those, last, novels, of, his, notwithstanding, their, unreality, make, all, other, novels, except, the, very, best, unreadable, colm, t, ib, n, observed, that, james, never, really, wrote, about, the, english, very, well, his, english, characters, don, t, work, for, me, despite, these, criticisms, james, is, now, valued, for, his, psychological, and, moral, realism, his, masterful, creation, of, character, his, low, key, but, playful, humour, and, his, assured, command, of, the, language, in, his, 1983, book, the, novels, of, henry, james, edward, wagenknecht, offers, an, assessment, that, echoes, theodora, bosanquet, s, to, be, completely, great, henry, james, wrote, in, an, early, review, a, work,

have, no, opinions, stands, foursquare, in, the, great, christian, humanistic, and, democratic, tradition, the, men, and, women, who, at, the, height, of, world, war, ii, raided, the, secondhand, shops, for, his, out, of, print, books, knew, what, they, were, about, for, no, writer, ever, raised, a, braver, banner, to, which, all, who, love, freedom, might, adhere, william, dean, howells, saw, james, as, a, representative, of, a, new, realist, school, of, literary, art, which, broke, with, the, english, romantic, tradition, epitomised, by, the, works, of, charles, dickens, and, william, thackeray, howells, wrote, that, realism, found, its, chief, exemplar, in, mr, james, a, novelist, he, is, not, after, the, old, fashion, or, after, any, fashion, but, his, own, f, r, leavis, championed, henry, james, as, a, novelist, of, established, pre, eminence, in, the, great, tradition, 1948, asserting, that, the, portrait, of, a, lady, and, the, bostonians, were, the, two, most, brilliant, novels, in, the, language, james, is, now, prized, as, a, master, of, point, of, view, who, moved, literary, fiction, forward, by, insisting, in, showing, not, telling, his, stories, to,
