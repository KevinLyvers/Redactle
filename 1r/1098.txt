unscrupulously, on, peasants, lands, and, bribed, the, officials, to, transfer, the, burden, of, taxation, to, the, poor, to, prevent, such, abuse, he, instituted, two, systems, yellow, records, and, fish, scale, records, they, served, both, to, secure, the, government, s, income, from, land, taxes, and, to, affirm, that, peasants, would, not, lose, their, lands, however, the, reforms, did, not,

elders, were, also, obliged, to, keep, surveillance, on, the, community, report, criminal, activities, and, ensure, that, the, residents, are, fully, committed, to, agricultural, work, the, yuan, dynasty, zhuse, huji, system, was, continued, and, the, households, were, categorized, into, different, types, the, most, basic, types, namely, civilian, households, military, households, craftsmen, households, and, salt, worker, households, defined, the, family, s, form, of, corv, e, labor, military, households, for, example, accounted, for, around, one, sixth, of, the, total, population, at, the, beginning, of, the, yongle, era, and, each, was, required, to, provide, an, adult, man, as, soldier, and, at, least, one, more, person, to, work, in, support, roles, in, the, military, the, military, craftsmen, and, salt, worker, households, were, hereditary, and, converting, into, civilian, households, was, impossible, except, in, a, few, very, rare, situations, a, family, may, simultaneously, belong, in, one, of, the, minor, categories, e, g, physician, households, and, scholar, households, according, to, their, occupation, in, addition, to, the, aforementioned, good, households, discriminatory, types, also, existed, such, as, entertainer, households, travelers, were, required, to, carry, a, luyin, a, permit, issued, by, the, local, government, and, their, neighbors, were, required, to, have, knowledge, of, their, itinerary, unauthorized, domestic, migration, was, banned, and, offenders, were, exiled, the, policy, was, strictly, enforced, during, the, hongwu, era, zhu, yuanzhang, passed, a, law, on, mandatory, hairstyle, on, 24, september, 1392, mandating, that, all, males, grow, their, hair, long, and, making, it, illegal, for, them, to, shave, part, of, their, foreheads, while, leaving, strands, of, hair, which, was, the, mongol, hairstyle, the, penalty, for, both, the, barber, and, the, person, who, was, shaved, and, his, sons, was, castration, if, they, cut, their, hair, and, their, families, were, to, be, sent, to, the, borders, for, exile, this, helped, eradicated, partially, shaved, mongol, hairstyles, and, enforced, long, han, hairstyle, the, hongwu, emperor, realized, that, the, northern, yuan, still, posed, a, threat, to, the, ming, even, though, they, had, been, driven, away, after, the, collapse, of, the, yuan, he, decided, to, reassess, the, orthodox, confucian, view, that, the, military, class, was, inferior, to, that, of, the, scholar, bureaucracy, he, kept, a, powerful, army, which, in, 1384, he, reorganized, using, a, model, known, as, the, weisuo, system, simplified, chinese, traditional, chinese, lit, guard, battalion, each, military, unit, consisted, of, 5, 600, men, divided, into, five, battalions, and, ten, companies, by, 1393, the, total, number, of, weisuo, troops, had, reached, 1, 200, 000, soldiers, were, also, assigned, land, on, which, to, grow, crops, whilst, their, positions, were, made, hereditary, this, type, of, system, can, be, traced, back, to, the, fubing, system, chinese, of, the, sui, and, tang, dynasties, training, was, conducted, within, local, military, districts, in, times, of, war, troops, were, mobilized, from, all, over, the, empire, on, the, orders, of, the, ministry, of, war, and, commanders, were, appointed, to, lead, them, to, battle, after, the, war, the, army, was, disbanded, into, smaller, groups, and, sent, back, to, their, respective, districts, while, the, commanders, had, to, return, their, authority, to, the, state, this, system, helped, to, prevent, military, leaders, from, having, too, much, power, the, military, was, under, the, control, of, a, civilian, official, for, large, campaigns, instead, of, a, military, general, hongwu, attempted, and, largely, succeeded, in, the, consolidation, of, control, over, all, aspects, of, government, so, that, no, other, group, could, gain, enough, power, to, overthrow, him, he, also, buttressed, the, country, s, defense, against, the, mongols, he, increasingly, concentrated, power, in, his, own, hands, he, abolished, the, chancellor, s, post, which, had, been, head, of, the, main, central, administrative, body, under, past, dynasties, by, suppressing, a, plot, for, which, he, had, blamed, his, chancellor, hu, weiyong, many, argue, that, hongwu, because, of, his, wish, to, concentrate, absolute, authority, in, his, own, hands, removed, the, only, insurance, against, incompetent, emperors, however, hongwu, could, not, govern, the, sprawling, ming, empire, all, by, himself, and, had, to, create, the, new, institution, of, the, grand, secretary, this, cabinet, like, organisation, progressively, took, on, the, powers, of, the, abolished, prime, minister, becoming, just, as, powerful, in, time, ray, huang, argued, that, grand, secretaries, outwardly, powerless, could, exercise, considerable, positive, influence, from, behind, the, throne, because, of, their, prestige, and, the, public, trust, which, they, enjoyed, they, could, act, as, intermediaries, between, the, emperor, and, the, ministerial, officials, and, thus, provide, a, stabilising, force, in, the, court, in, hongwu, s, elimination, of, the, traditional, offices, of, grand, councilor, the, primary, impetus, was, hu, weiyong, s, alleged, attempt, to, usurp, the, throne, hu, was, the, senior, grand, councilor, and, a, capable, administrator, however, over, the, years, the, magnitude, of, his, powers, as, well, as, involvement, in, several, political, scandals, eroded, the, paranoid, emperor, s, trust, in, him, finally, in, 1380, hongwu, had, hu, and, his, entire, family, arrested, and, executed, on, charges, of, treason, using, this, as, an, opportunity, to, purge, his, government, the, emperor, also, ordered, the, execution, of, countless, other, officials, as, well, as, their, families, for, associating, with, hu, the, purge, lasted, over, a, decade, and, resulted, in, more, than, 30, 000, executions, in, 1390, even, li, shanchang, one, of, the, closest, old, friends, of, the, emperor, who, was, rewarded, as, the, biggest, contributor, to, the, founding, of, the, ming, empire, was, executed, along, with, over, 70, members, of, his, extended, family, a, year, after, his, death, a, deputy, in, the, board, of, works, made, a, submission, to, the, emperor, appealing, li, s, innocence, arguing, that, since, li, was, already, at, the, apex, of, honour, wealth, and, power, the, accusation, that, he, wanted, to, help, someone, else, usurp, the, throne, was, clearly, ridiculous, hongwu, was, unable, to, refute, the, accusations, and, finally, ended, the, purge, shortly, afterwards, hongwu, also, noted, the, destructive, role, of, court, eunuchs, under, the, previous, dynasties, he, drastically, reduced, their, numbers, forbidding, them, to, handle, documents, insisting, that, they, remain, illiterate, and, executing, those, who, commented, on, state, affairs, the, emperor, had, a, strong, aversion, to, the, eunuchs, epitomized, by, a, tablet, in, his, palace, stipulating, eunuchs, must, have, nothing, to, do, with, the, administration, this, aversion, to, eunuchs, did, not, long, continue, among, his, successors, as, the, hongwu, and, jianwen, emperors, harsh, treatment, of, eunuchs, allowed, the, yongle, emperor, to, employ, them, as, a, power, base, during, his, coup, in, addition, to, hongwu, s, aversion, to, eunuchs, he, never, consented, to, any, of, his, consort, kin, becoming, court, officials, this, policy, was, fairly, well, maintained, by, later, emperors, and, no, serious, trouble, was, caused, by, the, empresses, or, their, families, the, embroidered, uniform, guard, was, transformed, into, a, secret, police, organization, during, the, hongwu, era, it, was, given, the, authority, to, overrule, judicial, proceedings, in, prosecutions, with, full, autonomy, in, arresting, interrogating, and, punishing, anyone, including, nobles, and, the, emperor, s, relatives, in, 1393, jiang, huan, the, chief, of, the, guard, accused, general, lan, yu, of, plotting, rebellion, 15, 000, people, were, executed, in, familial, extermination, during, the, subsequent, purges, according, to, hongwu, through, the, repeated, purges, and, the, elimination, of, the, historical, posts, hongwu, fundamentally, altered, the, centuries, old, government, structure, of, china, greatly, increasing, the, emperor, s, absolutism, the, legal, code, drawn, up, in, the, time, of, hongwu, was, considered, one, of, the, great, achievements, of, the, era, the, history, of, ming, mentioned, that, as, early, as, 1364, the, monarchy, had, started, to, draft, a, code, of, laws, this, code, was, known, as, da, ming, l, code, of, the, great, ming, the, emperor, devoted, much, time, to, the, project, and, instructed, his, ministers, that, the, code, should, be, comprehensive, and, intelligible, so, as, not, to, allow, any, official, to, exploit, loopholes, in, the, code, by, deliberately, misinterpreting, it, the, ming, code, laid, much, emphasis, on, family, relations, the, code, was, a, great, improvement, on, the, code, of, the, tang, dynasty, in, regards, to, the, treatment, of, slaves, under, the, tang, code, slaves, were, treated, as, a, species, of, domestic, animal, if, they, were, killed, by, a, free, citizen, the, law, imposed, no, sanction, on, the, killer, under, the, ming, dynasty, the, law, protected, both, slaves, and, free, citizens, later, during, his, reign, however, the, code, of, the, great, ming, was, set, aside, in, favor, of, the, far, harsher, legal, system, documented, in, da, gao, great, announcements, compared, to, the, da, ming, l, the, penalties, for, almost, all, crimes, were, drastically, increased, with, more, than, 1, 000, crimes, eligible, for, capital, punishment, much, of, the, da, gao, was, dedicated, to, the, government,
