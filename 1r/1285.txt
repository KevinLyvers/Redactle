catherine, de, medici, italian, caterina, de, medici, pronounced, french, catherine, de, m, dicis, pronounced, 13, april, 1519, 5, january, 1589, was, an, italian, florentine, noblewoman, born, into, the, medici, family, she, was, queen, of, france, from, 1547, to, 1559, by, marriage, to, king, henry, ii, and, the, mother, of, french, kings, francis, ii, charles, ix, and, henry, iii, the, years, during, which, her, sons, reigned, have, been, called, the, age, of, catherine, de, medici, since, she, had, extensive, albeit, at, times, varying, influence, on, the, political, life, of, france, catherine, was, born, in, florence, to, lorenzo, de, medici, duke, of, urbino, and, madeleine, de, la, tour, d, auvergne, in, 1533, at, the, age, of, 14, catherine, married, henry, the, second, son, of, king, francis, i, and, queen, claude, of, france, who, would, become, dauphin, of, france, upon, the, death, of, his, elder, brother, francis, in, 1536, catherine, s, marriage, was, arranged, by, her, first, cousin, twice, removed, pope, clement, vii, during, his, reign, henry, excluded, catherine, from, state, affairs, instead, showering, favours, on, his, chief, mistress, diane, de, poitiers, who, wielded, much, influence, over, him, henry, s, sudden, accidental, death, in, 1559, thrust, catherine, into, the, political, arena, as, mother, of, the, frail, 15, year, old, francis, ii, when, francis, ii, died, in, 1560, she, became, regent, on, behalf, of, her, 10, year, old, son, charles, ix, and, thus, gained, sweeping, powers, after, charles, died, in, 1574, catherine, played, a, key, role, in, the, reign, of, her, third, son, henry, iii, he, dispensed, with, her, advice, only, in, the, last, months, of, her, life, but, outlived, her, by, just, seven, months, catherine, s, three, sons, reigned, in, an, age, of, almost, constant, civil, and, religious, war, in, france, the, problems, facing, the, monarchy, were, complex, and, daunting, however, catherine, kept, the, monarchy, and, state, institutions, functioning, if, at, a, minimal, level, at, first, catherine, compromised, and, made, concessions, to, the, rebelling, calvinist, protestants, known, as, huguenots, however, she, failed, to, fully, grasp, the, theological, issues, that, drove, their, movement, later, she, resorted, in, frustration, and, anger, to, hardline, policies, against, them, in, return, she, was, blamed, for, the, persecutions, carried, out, under, her, sons, rules, in, particular, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, of, 1572, during, which, thousands, of, huguenots, were, killed, in, france, some, historians, have, excused, catherine, from, blame, for, the, worst, decisions, of, the, crown, but, evidence, for, her, ruthlessness, can, be, found, in, her, letters, in, practice, her, authority, was, limited, by, the, effects, of, the, civil, wars, and, she, suffers, in, comparison, to, what, might, have, been, had, her, husband, the, king, lived, to, take, responsibility, or, stabilise, the, country, therefore, her, policies, may, be, seen, as, desperate, measures, to, keep, the, house, of, valois, on, the, throne, at, all, costs, and, her, patronage, of, the, arts, as, an, attempt, to, glorify, a, monarchy, whose, prestige, was, in, steep, decline, without, catherine, it, is, unlikely, that, her, sons, would, have, remained, in, power, catherine, has, been, called, the, most, important, woman, in, europe, in, the, 16th, century, catherine, de, medici, was, born, caterina, maria, romula, de, medici, on, 13, april, 1519, in, florence, republic,

the, year, before, at, amboise, as, part, of, the, alliance, between, king, francis, i, of, france, and, lorenzo, s, uncle, pope, leo, x, against, the, holy, roman, emperor, maximilian, i, according, to, a, contemporary, chronicler, when, catherine, was, born, her, parents, were, as, pleased, as, if, it, had, been, a, boy, within, a, month, of, catherine, s, birth, both, her, parents, were, dead, madeleine, died, on, 28, april, of, puerperal, fever, and, lorenzo, died, on, 4, may, king, francis, wanted, catherine, to, be, raised, at, the, french, court, but, pope, leo, refused, claiming, he, wanted, her, to, marry, ippolito, de, medici, leo, made, catherine, duchess, of, urbino, but, annexed, most, of, the, duchy, of, urbino, to, the, papal, states, permitting, florence, to, keep, only, the, fortress, of, san, leo, it, was, only, after, leo, s, death, in, 1521, that, his, successor, adrian, vi, restored, the, duchy, to, its, rightful, owner, francesco, maria, i, della, rovere, catherine, was, first, cared, for, by, her, paternal, grandmother, alfonsina, orsini, after, alfonsina, s, death, in, 1520, catherine, joined, her, cousins, and, was, raised, by, her, aunt, clarice, de, medici, the, death, of, pope, leo, in, 1521, briefly, interrupted, medici, power, until, cardinal, giulio, de, medici, was, elected, pope, clement, vii, in, 1523, clement, housed, catherine, in, the, palazzo, medici, riccardi, in, florence, where, she, lived, in, state, the, florentine, people, called, her, duchessina, the, little, duchess, in, deference, to, her, unrecognised, claim, to, the, duchy, of, urbino, in, 1527, the, medici, were, overthrown, in, florence, by, a, faction, opposed, to, the, regime, of, clement, s, representative, cardinal, silvio, passerini, and, catherine, was, taken, hostage, and, placed, in, a, series, of, convents, the, final, one, the, santissima, annuziata, delle, murate, was, her, home, for, three, years, mark, strage, described, these, years, as, the, happiest, of, her, entire, life, clement, had, no, choice, but, to, crown, charles, of, austria, as, holy, roman, emperor, in, return, for, his, help, in, retaking, the, city, in, october, 1529, charles, s, troops, laid, siege, to, florence, as, the, siege, dragged, on, voices, called, for, catherine, to, be, killed, and, exposed, naked, and, chained, to, the, city, walls, some, even, suggested, that, she, be, handed, over, to, the, troops, to, be, raped, the, city, finally, surrendered, on, 12, august, 1530, clement, summoned, catherine, from, her, beloved, convent, to, join, him, in, rome, where, he, greeted, her, with, open, arms, and, tears, in, his, eyes, then, he, set, about, the, business, of, finding, her, a, husband, on, her, visit, to, rome, the, venetian, envoy, described, catherine, as, small, of, stature, and, thin, and, without, delicate, features, but, having, the, protruding, eyes, peculiar, to, the, medici, family, suitors, however, lined, up, for, her, hand, including, james, v, of, scotland, who, sent, the, duke, of, albany, to, clement, to, conclude, a, marriage, in, april, and, november, 1530, when, francis, i, of, france, proposed, his, second, son, henry, duke, of, orl, ans, in, early, 1533, clement, jumped, at, the, offer, henry, was, a, prize, catch, for, catherine, who, despite, her, wealth, was, of, common, origin, the, wedding, a, grand, affair, marked, by, extravagant, display, and, gift, giving, took, place, in, the, glise, saint, ferr, ol, les, augustins, in, marseille, on, 28, october, 1533, prince, henry, danced, and, jousted, for, catherine, the, fourteen, year, old, couple, left, their, wedding, ball, at, midnight, to, perform, their, nuptial, duties, henry, arrived, in, the, bedroom, with, king, francis, who, is, said, to, have, stayed, until, the, marriage, was, consummated, he, noted, that, each, had, shown, valour, in, the, joust, clement, visited, the, newlyweds, in, bed, the, next, morning, and, added, his, blessings, to, the, night, s, proceedings, catherine, saw, little, of, her, husband, in, their, first, year, of, marriage, but, the, ladies, of, the, court, impressed, with, her, intelligence, and, keenness, to, please, treated, her, well, however, the, death, of, her, uncle, clement, on, 25, september, 1534, undermined, catherine, s, standing, in, the, french, court, the, next, pope, alessandro, farnese, was, elected, on, 13, october, and, took, the, title, paul, iii, as, a, farnese, he, felt, no, obligation, to, keep, clement, s, promises, broke, the, alliance, with, francis, and, refused, to, continue, paying, her, huge, dowry, king, francis, lamented, the, girl, has, come, to, me, stark, naked, prince, henry, showed, no, interest, in, catherine, as, a, wife, instead, he, openly, took, mistresses, for, the, first, ten, years, of, the, marriage, the, royal, couple, failed, to, produce, any, children, together, in, 1537, he, had, a, brief, affair, with, philippa, duci, who, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, whom, he, publicly, acknowledged, this, proved, that, henry, was, fertile, and, added, to, the, pressure, on, catherine, to, produce, a, child, in, 1536, henry, s, older, brother, francis, caught, a, chill, after, a, game, of, tennis, contracted, a, fever, and, died, shortly, after, leaving, henry, the, heir, suspicions, of, poison, abounded, from, catherine, to, emperor, charles, v, sebastiano, de, montecuccoli, confessed, under, torture, to, poisoning, the, dauphin, as, dauphine, catherine, was, expected, to, provide, a, future, heir, to, the, throne, according, to, the, court, chronicler, brant, me, many, people, advised, the, king, and, the, dauphin, to, repudiate, her, since, it, was, necessary, to, continue, the, line, of, france, divorce, was, discussed, in, desperation, catherine, tried, every, known, trick, for, getting, pregnant, such, as, placing, cow, dung, and, ground, stags, antlers, on, her, source, of, life, and, drinking, mule, s, urine, on, 19, january, 1544, she, at, last, gave, birth, to, a, son, named, after, king, francis, after, becoming, pregnant, once, catherine, had, no, trouble, doing, so, again, she, may, have, owed, her, change, of, fortune, to, the, physician, jean, fernel, who, may, have, noticed, slight, abnormalities, in, the, couple, s, sexual, organs, and, advised, them, how, to, solve, the, problem, however, he, denied, ever, providing, such, advice, catherine, quickly, conceived, again, and, on, 2, april, 1545, she, bore, a, daughter, elisabeth, she, went, on, to, bear, henry, a, further, eight, children, seven, of, whom, survived, infancy, including, the, future, charles, ix, born, 27, june, 1550, the, future, henry, iii, born, 19, september, 1551, and, francis, duke, of, anjou, born, 18, march, 1555, claude, born, 12, november, 1547, and, margaret, born, 14, may, 1553, the, long, term, future, of, the, valois, dynasty, which, had, ruled, france, since, the, 14th, century, seemed, assured, however, catherine, s, ability, to, bear, children, failed, to, improve, her, marriage, about, 1538, at, the, age, of, 19, henry, had, taken, as, his, mistress, the, 38, year, old, diane, de, poitiers, whom, he, adored, for, the, rest, of, his, life, even, so, he, respected, catherine, s, status, as, his, consort, when, king, francis, i, died, on, 31, march, 1547, catherine, became, queen, consort, of, france, she, was, crowned, in, the, basilica, of, saint, denis, on, 10, june, 1549, henry, allowed, catherine, almost, no, political, influence, as, queen, although, she, sometimes, acted, as, regent, during, his, absences, from, france, her, formal, powers, were, strictly, nominal, henry, even, gave, the, ch, teau, of, chenonceau, which, catherine, had, wanted, for, herself, to, his, mistress, diane, de, poitiers, instead, who, took, her, place, at, the, center, of, power, dispensing, patronage, and, accepting, favors, the, imperial, ambassador, reported, that, in, the, presence, of, guests, henry, would, sit, on, diane, s, lap, and, play, the, guitar, chat, about, politics, or, fondle, her, breasts, diane, never, regarded, catherine, as, a, threat, she, even, encouraged, the, king, to, spend, more, time, with, catherine, and, sire, more, children, in, 1556, catherine, nearly, died, giving, birth, to, twin, daughters, jeanne, and, victoire, surgeons, saved, her, life, by, breaking, the, legs, of, jeanne, who, died, in, her, womb, the, surviving, daughter, victoire, died, seven, weeks, later, because, their, birth, very, nearly, cost, catherine, her, life, the, king, s, physician, advised, the, king, that, there, should, be, no, more, children, therefore, henry, ii, stopped, visiting, his, wife, s, bedroom, and, spent, all, his, time, with, his, longtime, mistress, diane, de, poitiers, catherine, had, no, more, children, henry, s, reign, enabled, the, rise, of, the, guise, brothers, charles, who, became, a, cardinal, and, henry, s, boyhood, friend, francis, both, of, whom, became, duke, of, guise, their, sister, mary, of, guise, had, married, james, v, of, scotland, in, 1538, and, was, the, mother, of, mary, queen, of, scots, at, the, age, of, five, and, a, half, mary, was, brought, to, the, french, court, where, she, was, promised, to, the, dauphin, francis, catherine, brought, her, up, with, her, own, children, at, the, french, court, while, mary, of, guise, governed, scotland, as, her, daughter, s, regent, on, 3, 4, april, 1559, henry, signed, the, peace, of, cateau, cambr, sis, with, the, holy, roman, empire, and, england, ending, a, long, period, of, italian, wars, the, treaty, was, sealed, by, the, betrothal, of, catherine, s, teenage, daughter, elisabeth, aged, 13, to, philip, ii, of, spain, their, proxy, wedding, was, celebrated, in, paris, on, 22, june, 1559, as, part, of, the, celebrations, a, jousting, tournament, was, held, on, 30, june, 1559, king, henry, took, part, in, the, jousting, sporting, diane, s, black, and, white, colours, he, defeated, the, dukes, of, guise, and, nemours, but, the, young, gabriel, comte, de, montgomery, knocked, him, half, out, of, the, saddle, henry, insisted, on, riding, against, montgomery, again, and, this, time, montgomery, s, lance, shattered, in, the, king, s, face, henry, reeled, out, of, the, clash, his, face, pouring, blood, with, splinters, of, a, good, bigness, sticking, out, of, his, eye, and, head, catherine, diane, and, prince, francis, all, fainted, henry, was, carried, to, the, ch, teau, de, tournelles, where, five, splinters, of, wood, were, extracted, from, his, head, one, of, which, had, pierced, his, eye, and, brain, catherine, stayed, by, his, bedside, but, diane, kept, away, for, fear, in, the, words, of, a, chronicler, of, being, expelled, by, the, queen, for, the, next, ten, days, henry, s, state, fluctuated, at, times, he, even, felt, well, enough, to, dictate, letters, and, listen, to, music, slowly, however, he, lost, his, sight, speech, and, reason, and, on, 10, july, 1559, he, died, aged, 40, from, that, day, catherine, took, a, broken, lance, as, her, emblem, inscribed, with, the, words, lacrymae, hinc, hinc, dolor, from, this, come, my, tears, and, my, pain, and, wore, black, mourning, in, memory, of, henry, francis, ii, became, king, at, the, age, of, fifteen, in, what, has, been, called, a, coup, d, tat, the, cardinal, of, lorraine, and, the, duke, of, guise, whose, niece, mary, queen, of, scots, had, married, francis, ii, the, year, before, seized, power, the, day, after, henry, ii, s, death, and, quickly, moved, themselves, into, the, louvre, palace, with, the, young, couple, the, english, ambassador, reported, a, few, days, later, that, the, house, of, guise, ruleth, and, doth, all, about, the, french, king, for, the, moment, catherine, worked, with, the, guises, out, of, necessity, she, was, not, strictly, entitled, to, a, role, in, francis, s, government, because, he, was, deemed, old, enough, to, rule, for, himself, nevertheless, all, his, official, acts, began, with, the, words, this, being, the, good, pleasure, of, the, queen, my, lady, mother, and, i, also, approving, of, every, opinion, that, she, holdeth, am, content, and, command, that, catherine, did, not, hesitate, to, exploit, her, new, authority, one, of, her, first, acts, was, to, force, diane, de, poitiers, to, hand, over, the, crown, jewels, and, return, the, ch, teau, de, chenonceau, to, the, crown, she, later, did, her, best, to, efface, or, outdo, diane, s, building, work, there, the, guise, brothers, set, about, persecuting, the, protestants, with, zeal, catherine, adopted, a, moderate, stance, and, spoke, against, the, guise, persecutions, though, she, had, no, particular, sympathy, for, the, huguenots, whose, beliefs, she, never, shared, the, protestants, looked, for, leadership, first, to, antoine, de, bourbon, king, of, navarre, the, first, prince, of, the, blood, and, then, with, more, success, to, his, brother, louis, de, bourbon, prince, of, cond, who, backed, a, plot, to, overthrow, the, guises, by, force, when, the, guises, heard, of, the, plot, they, moved, the, court, to, the, fortified, ch, teau, of, amboise, the, duke, of, guise, launched, an, attack, into, the, woods, around, the, ch, teau, his, troops, surprised, the, rebels, and, killed, many, of, them, on, the, spot, including, the, commander, la, renaudie, others, they, drowned, in, the, river, or, strung, up, around, the, battlements, while, catherine, and, the, court, watched, in, june, 1560, michel, de, l, h, pital, was, appointed, chancellor, of, france, he, sought, the, support, of, france, s, constitutional, bodies, and, worked, closely, with, catherine, to, defend, the, law, in, the, face, of, the, growing, anarchy, neither, saw, the, need, to, punish, protestants, who, worshipped, in, private, and, did, not, take, up, arms, on, 20, august, 1560, catherine, and, the, chancellor, advocated, this, policy, to, an, assembly, of, notables, at, fontainebleau, historians, regard, the, occasion, as, an, early, example, of, catherine, s, statesmanship, meanwhile, cond, raised, an, army, and, in, autumn, 1560, began, attacking, towns, in, the, south, catherine, ordered, him, to, court, and, had, him, imprisoned, as, soon, as, he, arrived, he, was, tried, in, november, found, guilty, of, offences, against, the, crown, and, sentenced, to, death, his, life, was, saved, by, the, illness, and, death, of, the, king, as, a, result, of, an, infection, or, an, abscess, in, his, ear, when, catherine, realized, francis, was, going, to, die, she, made, a, pact, with, antoine, de, bourbon, by, which, he, would, renounce, his, right, to, the, regency, of, the, future, king, charles, ix, in, return, for, the, release, of, his, brother, cond, as, a, result, when, francis, died, on, 5, december, 1560, the, privy, council, appointed, catherine, as, governor, of, france, gouvernante, de, france, with, sweeping, powers, she, wrote, to, her, daughter, elisabeth, my, principal, aim, is, to, have, the, honour, of, god, before, my, eyes, in, all, things, and, to, preserve, my, authority, not, for, myself, but, for, the, conservation, of, this, kingdom, and, for, the, good, of, all, your, brothers, charles, ix, was, ten, years, old, at, the, time, of, his, royal, consecration, during, which, he, cried, at, first, catherine, kept, him, very, close, to, her, and, even, slept, in, his, chamber, she, presided, over, his, council, decided, policy, and, controlled, state, business, and, patronage, however, she, was, never, in, a, position, to, control, the, country, as, a, whole, which, was, on, the, brink, of, civil, war, in, many, parts, of, france, the, rule, of, nobles, held, sway, rather, than, that, of, the, crown, the, challenges, catherine, faced, were, complex, and, in, some, ways, difficult, for, her, to, comprehend, as, a, foreigner, she, summoned, church, leaders, from, both, sides, to, attempt, to, solve, their, doctrinal, differences, despite, her, optimism, the, resulting, colloquy, of, poissy, ended, in, failure, on, 13, october, 1561, dissolving, itself, without, her, permission, catherine, failed, because, she, saw, the, religious, divide, only, in, political, terms, in, the, words, of, historian, r, j, knecht, she, underestimated, the, strength, of, religious, conviction, imagining, that, all, would, be, well, if, only, she, could, get, the, party, leaders, to, agree, in, january, 1562, catherine, issued, the, tolerant, edict, of, saint, germain, in, a, further, attempt, to, build, bridges, with, the, protestants, on, 1, march, 1562, however, in, an, incident, known, as, the, massacre, of, vassy, the, duke, of, guise, and, his, men, attacked, worshipping, huguenots, in, a, barn, at, vassy, killing, 74, and, wounding, 104, guise, who, called, the, massacre, a, regrettable, accident, was, cheered, as, a, hero, in, the, streets, of, paris, while, the, huguenots, called, for, revenge, the, massacre, lit, the, fuse, that, sparked, the, french, wars, of, religion, for, the, next, thirty, years, france, found, itself, in, a, state, of, either, civil, war, or, armed, truce, within, a, month, louis, de, bourbon, prince, of, cond, and, admiral, gaspard, de, coligny, had, raised, an, army, of, 1, 800, they, formed, an, alliance, with, england, and, seized, town, after, town, in, france, catherine, met, coligny, but, he, refused, to, back, down, she, therefore, told, him, since, you, rely, on, your, forces, we, will, show, you, ours, the, royal, army, struck, back, quickly, and, laid, siege, to, huguenot, held, rouen, catherine, visited, the, deathbed, of, antoine, de, bourbon, king, of, navarre, after, he, was, fatally, wounded, by, an, arquebus, shot, catherine, insisted, on, visiting, the, field, herself, and, when, warned, of, the, dangers, laughed, my, courage, is, as, great, as, yours, the, catholics, took, rouen, but, their, triumph, was, short, lived, on, 18, february, 1563, a, spy, called, poltrot, de, m, r, fired, an, arquebus, into, the, back, of, the, duke, of, guise, at, the, siege, of, orl, ans, the, murder, triggered, an, aristocratic, blood, feud, that, complicated, the, french, civil, wars, for, years, to, come, catherine, however, was, delighted, with, the, death, of, her, ally, if, monsieur, de, guise, had, perished, sooner, she, told, the, venetian, ambassador, peace, would, have, been, achieved, more, quickly, on, 19, march, 1563, the, edict, of, amboise, also, known, as, the, edict, of, pacification, ended, the, war, catherine, now, rallied, both, huguenot, and, catholic, forces, to, retake, le, havre, from, the, english, on, 17, august, 1563, charles, ix, was, declared, of, age, at, the, parlement, of, rouen, but, he, was, never, able, to, rule, on, his, own, and, showed, little, interest, in, government, catherine, decided, to, launch, a, drive, to, enforce, the, edict, of, amboise, and, revive, loyalty, to, the, crown, to, this, end, she, set, out, with, charles, and, the, court, on, a, progress, around, france, that, lasted, from, january, 1564, until, may, 1565, catherine, held, talks, with, jeanne, d, albret, the, protestant, queen, regnant, of, navarre, and, the, wife, of, antoine, de, bourbon, at, m, con, and, n, rac, she, also, met, her, daughter, elisabeth, at, bayonne, near, the, spanish, border, amidst, lavish, court, festivities, philip, ii, excused, himself, from, the, occasion, he, sent, the, duke, of, alba, to, tell, catherine, to, scrap, the, edict, of, amboise, and, to, find, punitive, solutions, to, the, problem, of, heresy, in, 1566, through, the, ambassador, to, the, ottoman, empire, guillaume, de, grandchamp, de, grantrie, and, because, of, a, long, standing, franco, ottoman, alliance, charles, and, catherine, proposed, to, the, ottoman,

habsburg, this, plan, also, had, the, added, advantage, of, removing, the, huguenots, from, france, but, it, failed, to, interest, the, ottomans, on, 27, september, 1567, in, a, swoop, known, as, the, surprise, of, meaux, huguenot, forces, attempted, to, ambush, the, king, triggering, renewed, civil, war, taken, unawares, the, court, fled, to, paris, in, disarray, the, war, was, ended, by, the, peace, of, longjumeau, of, 22, 23, march, 1568, but, civil, unrest, and, bloodshed, continued, the, surprise, of, meaux, marked, a, turning, point, in, catherine, s, policy, towards, the, huguenots, from, that, moment, she, abandoned, compromise, for, a, policy, of, repression, she, told, the, venetian, ambassador, in, june, 1568, that, all, one, could, expect, from, huguenots, was, deceit, and, she, praised, the, duke, of, alba, s, reign, of, terror, in, the, netherlands, where, calvinists, and, rebels, were, put, to, death, in, the, thousands, the, huguenots, retreated, to, the, fortified,

of, us, jeanne, wrote, to, catherine, rather, than, abandon, our, god, and, our, religion, catherine, called, jeanne, whose, decision, to, rebel, posed, a, dynastic, threat, to, the, valois, the, most, shameless, woman, in, the, world, nevertheless, the, peace, of, saint, germain, en, laye, signed, on, 8, august, 1570, because, the, royal, army, ran, out, of, cash, conceded, wider, toleration, to, the, huguenots, than, ever, before, catherine, looked, to, further, valois, interests, by, grand, dynastic, marriages, in, 1570, charles, ix, married, elisabeth, of, austria, daughter, of, maximilian, ii, holy, roman, emperor, catherine, was, also, eager, for, a, match, between, one, of, her, two, youngest, sons, and, elizabeth, i, of, england, after, catherine, s, daughter, elisabeth, died, in, childbirth, in, 1568, she, had, touted, her, youngest, daughter, margaret, as, a, bride, for, philip, ii, of, spain, now, she, sought, a, marriage, between, margaret, and, henry, iii, of, navarre, jeanne, s, son, with, the, aim, of, uniting, valois, and, bourbon, interests, margaret, however, was, secretly, involved, with, henry, of, guise, the, son, of, the, late, duke, of, guise, when, catherine, found, this, out, she, had, her, daughter, brought, from, her, bed, catherine, and, the, king, then, beat, her, ripping, her, nightclothes, and, pulling, out, handfuls, of, her, hair, catherine, pressed, jeanne, d, albret, to, attend, court, writing, that, she, wanted, to, see, jeanne, s, children, she, promised, not, to, harm, them, jeanne, replied, pardon, me, if, reading, that, i, want, to, laugh, because, you, want, to, relieve, me, of, a, fear, that, i, ve, never, had, i, ve, never, thought, that, as, they, say, you, eat, little, children, when, jeanne, did, come, to, court, catherine, pressured, her, hard, playing, on, jeanne, s, hopes, for, her, beloved, son, jeanne, finally, agreed, to, the, marriage, between, her, son, and, margaret, so, long, as, henry, could, remain, a, huguenot, when, jeanne, arrived, in, paris, to, buy, clothes, for, the, wedding, she, was, taken, ill, and, died, on, 9, june, 1572, aged, forty, three, huguenot, writers, later, accused, catherine, of, murdering, her, with, poisoned, gloves, the, wedding, took, place, on, 18, august, 1572, at, notre, dame, paris, three, days, later, admiral, coligny, was, walking, back, to, his, rooms, from, the, louvre, when, a, shot, rang, out, from, a, house, and, wounded, him, in, the, hand, and, arm, a, smoking, arquebus, was, discovered, in, a, window, but, the, culprit, had, made, his,

from, his, elbow, and, amputated, a, damaged, finger, with, a, pair, of, scissors, catherine, who, was, said, to, have, received, the, news, without, emotion, made, a, tearful, visit, to, coligny, and, promised, to, punish, his, attacker, many, historians, have, blamed, catherine, for, the, attack, on, coligny, others, point, to, the, guise, family, or, a, spanish, papal, plot, to, end, coligny, s, influence, on, the, king, whatever, the, truth, the, bloodbath, that, followed, was, soon, beyond, the, control, of, catherine, or, any, other, leader, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, which, began, two, days, later, has, stained, catherine, s, reputation, ever, since, there, is, reason, to, believe, she, was, party, to, the, decision, when, on, 23, august, charles, ix, is, said, to, have, ordered, then, kill, them, all, kill, them, all, historians, have, suggested, that, catherine, and, her, advisers, expected, a, huguenot, uprising, to, avenge, the, attack, on, coligny, they, chose, therefore, to, strike, first, and, wipe, out, the, huguenot, leaders, while, they, were, still, in, paris, after, the, wedding, the, slaughter, in, paris, lasted, for, almost, a, week, it, spread, to, many, parts, of, france, where, it, persisted, into, the, autumn, in, the, words, of, historian, jules, michelet, st, bartholomew, was, not, a, day, but, a, season, on, 29, september, when, navarre, knelt, before, the, altar, as, a, roman, catholic, having, converted, to, avoid, being, killed, catherine, turned, to, the, ambassadors, and, laughed, from, this, time, dates, the, legend, of, the, wicked, italian, queen, huguenot, writers, branded, catherine, a, scheming, italian, who, had, acted, on, machiavelli, s, principles, to, kill, all, enemies, in, one, blow, two, years, later, catherine, faced, a, new, crisis, with, the, death, of, charles, ix, at, the, age, of, twenty, three, his, dying, words, were, oh, my, mother, the, day, before, he, died, he, named, catherine, regent, since, his, brother, and, heir, henry, the, duke, of, anjou, was, in, the, polish, lithuanian, commonwealth, where, he, had, been, elected, king, the, year, before, however, three, months, after, his, coronation, at, wawel, cathedral, henry, abandoned, that, throne, and, returned, to, france, in, order, to, become, king, of, france, catherine, wrote, to, henry, of, charles, ix, s, death, i, am, grief, stricken, to, have, witnessed, such, a, scene, and, the, love, which, he, showed, me, at, the, end, my, only, consolation, is, to, see, you, here, soon, as, your, kingdom, requires, and, in, good, health, for, if, i, were, to, lose, you, i, would, have, myself, buried, alive, with, you, henry, was, catherine, s, favourite, son, unlike, his, brothers, he, came, to, the, throne, as, a, grown, man, he, was, also, healthier, though, he, suffered, from, weak, lungs, and, constant, fatigue, his, interest, in, the, tasks, of, government, however, proved, fitful, he, depended, on, catherine, and, her, team, of, secretaries, until, the, last, few, weeks, of, her, life, he, often, hid, from, state, affairs, immersing, himself, in, acts, of, piety, such, as, pilgrimages, and, flagellation, henry, married, louise, de, lorraine, vaud, mont, in, february, 1575, two, days, after, his, coronation, his, choice, thwarted, catherine, s, plans, for, a, political, marriage, to, a, foreign, princess, rumours, of, henry, s, inability, to, produce, children, were, by, that, time, in, wide, circulation, the, papal, nuncio, salviati, observed, it, is, only, with, difficulty, that, we, can, imagine, there, will, be, offspring, physicians, and, those, who, know, him, well, say, that, he, has, an, extremely, weak, constitution, and, will, not, live, long, as, time, passed, and, the, likelihood, of, children, from, the, marriage, receded, catherine, s, youngest, son, francis, duke, of, alen, on, known, as, monsieur, played, upon, his, role, as, heir, to, the, throne, repeatedly, exploiting, the, anarchy, of, the, civil, wars, which, were, by, now, as, much, about, noble, power, struggles, as, religion, catherine, did, all, in, her, power, to, bring, francis, back, into, the, fold, on, one, occasion, in, march, 1578, she, lectured, him, for, six, hours, about, his, dangerously, subversive, behaviour, in, 1576, in, a, move, that, endangered, henry, s, throne, francis, allied, with, the, protestant, princes, against, the, crown, on, 6, may, 1576, catherine, gave, in, to, almost, all, huguenot, demands, in, the, edict, of, beaulieu, the, treaty, became, known, as, the, peace, of, monsieur, because, it, was, thought, that, francis, had, forced, it, on, the, crown, francis, died, of, consumption, in, june, 1584, after, a, disastrous, intervention, in, the, low, countries, during, which, his, army, had, been, massacred, catherine, wrote, the, next, day, i, am, so, wretched, to, live, long, enough, to, see, so, many, people, die, before, me, although, i, realize, that, god, s, will, must, be, obeyed, that, he, owns, everything, and, that, he, lends, us, only, for, as, long, as, he, likes, the, children, whom, he, gives, us, the, death, of, her, youngest, son, was, a, calamity, for, catherine, s, dynastic, dreams, under, salic, law, by, which, only, males, could, ascend, the, throne, the, huguenot, henry, of, navarre, now, became, heir, presumptive, to, the, french, crown, catherine, had, at, least, taken, the, precaution, of, marrying, margaret, her, youngest, daughter, to, navarre, margaret, however, became, almost, as, much, of, a, thorn, in, catherine, s, side, as, francis, and, in, 1582, she, returned, to, the, french, court, without, her, husband, catherine, was, heard, yelling, at, her, for, taking, lovers, catherine, sent, pomponne, de, belli, vre, to, navarre, to, arrange, margaret, s, return, in, 1585, margaret, fled, navarre, again, she, retreated, to, her, property, at, agen, and, begged, her, mother, for, money, catherine, sent, her, only, enough, to, put, food, on, her, table, moving, on, to, the, fortress, of, carlat, margaret, took, a, lover, called, d, aubiac, catherine, asked, henry, to, act, before, margaret, brought, shame, on, them, again, in, october, 1586, therefore, he, had, margaret, locked, up, in, the, ch, teau, d, usson, d, aubiac, was, executed, though, not, despite, catherine, s, wish, in, front, of, margaret, catherine, cut, margaret, out, of, her, will, and, never, saw, her, again, catherine, was, unable, to, control, henry, in, the, way, she, had,

to, head, off, war, in, 1578, she, took, on, the, task, of, pacifying, the, south, at, the, age, of, fifty, nine, she, embarked, on, an, eighteen, month, journey, around, the, south, of, france, to, meet, huguenot, leaders, face, to, face, her, efforts, won, catherine, new, respect, from, the, french, people, on, her, return, to, paris, in, 1579, she, was, greeted, outside, the, city, by, the, parlement, and, crowds, the, venetian, ambassador, gerolamo, lipomanno, wrote, she, is, an, indefatigable, princess, born, to, tame, and, govern, a, people, as, unruly, as, the, french, they, now, recognize, her, merits, her, concern, for, unity, and, are, sorry, not, to, have, appreciated, her, sooner, she, was, under, no, illusions, however, on, 25, november, 1579, she, wrote, to, the, king, you, are, on, the, eve, of, a, general, revolt, anyone, who, tells, you, differently, is, a, liar, many, leading, roman, catholics, were, appalled, by, catherine, s, attempts, to, appease, the, huguenots, after, the, edict, of, beaulieu, they, had, started, forming, local, leagues, to, protect, their, religion, the, death, of, the, heir, to, the, throne, in, 1584, prompted, the, duke, of,

the, king, especially, about, your, person, there, is, so, much, treachery, about, that, i, die, of, fear, henry, was, unable, to, fight, the, catholics, and, the, protestants, at, once, both, of, whom, had, stronger, armies, than, his, own, in, the, treaty, of, nemours, signed, on, 7, july, 1585, he, was, forced, to, give, in, to, all, the, league, s, demands, even, that, he, pay, its, troops,

children, on, her, arms, and, two, families, of, france, who, were, thinking, of, grasping, the, crown, our, own, and, the, guises, was, she, not, compelled, to, play, strange, parts, to, deceive, first, one, and, then, the, other, in, order, to, guard, as, she, did, her, sons, who, successively, reigned, through, the, wise, conduct, of, that, shrewd, woman, i, am, surprised, that, she, never, did, worse, catherine, believed, in, the, humanist, ideal, of, the, learned, renaissance, prince, whose, authority, depended, on, letters, as, well, as, arms, she, was, inspired, by, the, example, of, her, father, in, law, king, francis, i, of, france, who, had, hosted, the, leading, artists, of, europe, at, his, court, and, by, her, medici, ancestors, in, an, age, of, civil, war, and, declining, respect, for, the, monarchy, she, sought, to, bolster, royal, prestige, through, lavish, cultural, display, once, in, control, of, the, royal, purse, she, launched, a, programme, of, artistic, patronage, that, lasted, for, three, decades, during, this, time, she, presided, over, a, distinctive, late, french, renaissance, culture, in, all, branches, of, the, arts, an, inventory, drawn, up, at, the, h, tel, de, la, reine, after, catherine, s, death, shows, her, to, have, been, a, keen, collector, listed, works, of, art, included, tapestries, hand, drawn, maps, sculptures, rich, fabrics, ebony, furniture, inlaid, with, ivory, sets, of, china, and, limoges, pottery, there, were, also, hundreds, of, portraits, for, which, a, vogue, had, developed, during, catherine, s, lifetime, many, portraits, in, her, collection, were, by, jean, clouet, 1480, 1541, and, his, son, fran, ois, clouet, c, 1510, 1572, fran, ois, clouet, drew, and, painted, portraits, of, all, catherine, s, family, and, of, many, members, of, the, court, after, catherine, s, death, a, decline, in, the, quality, of, french, portraiture, set, in, by, 1610, the, school, patronised, by, the, late, valois, court, and, brought, to, its, pinnacle, by, fran, ois, clouet, had, all, but, died, out, beyond, portraiture, little, is, known, about, the, painting, at, catherine, de, medici, s, court, in, the, last, two, decades, of, her, life, only, two, painters, stand, out, as, recognisable, personalities, jean, cousin, the, younger, c, 1522, c, 1594, few, of, whose, works, survive, and, antoine, caron, c, 1521, 1599, who, became, catherine, s, official, painter, after, working, at, fontainebleau, under, primaticcio, caron, s, vivid, mannerism, with, its, love, of, ceremonial, and, its, preoccupation, with, massacres, reflects, the, neurotic, atmosphere, of, the, french, court, during, the, wars, of, religion, many, of, caron, s, paintings, such, as, those, of, the, triumphs, of, the, seasons, are, of, allegorical, subjects, that, echo, the, festivities, for, which, catherine, s, court, was, famous, his, designs, for, the, valois, tapestries, celebrate, the, f, tes, picnics, and, mock, battles, of, the, magnificent, entertainments, hosted, by, catherine, they, depict, events, held, at, fontainebleau, in, 1564, at, bayonne, in, 1565, for, the, summit, meeting, with, the, spanish, court, and, at, the, tuileries, in, 1573, for, the, visit, of, the, polish, ambassadors, who, presented, the, polish, crown, to, catherine, s, son, henry, of, anjou, the, musical, shows, in, particular, allowed, catherine, to, express, her, creative, gifts, they, were, usually, dedicated, to, the, ideal, of, peace, in, the, realm, and, based, on, mythological, themes, to, create, the, necessary, dramas, music, and, scenic, effects, for, these, events, catherine, employed, the, leading, artists, and, architects, of, the, day, historian, frances, yates, has, called, her, a, great, creative, artist, in, festivals, catherine, gradually, introduced, changes, to, the, traditional, entertainments, for, example, she, increased, the, prominence, of, dance, in, the, shows, that, climaxed, each, series, of, entertainments, a, distinctive, new, art, form, the, ballet, de, cour, emerged, from, these, creative, advances, owing, to, its, synthesis, of, dance, music, verse, and, setting, the, production, of, the, ballet, comique, de, la, reine, in, 1581, is, regarded, by, scholars, as, the, first, authentic, ballet, catherine, de, medici, s, great, love, among, the, arts, was, architecture, as, the, daughter, of, the, medici, suggests, french, art, historian, jean, pierre, babelon, she, was, driven, by, a, passion, to, build, and, a, desire, to, leave, great, achievements, behind, her, when, she, died, after, henry, ii, s, death, catherine, set, out, to, immortalise, her, husband, s, memory, and, to, enhance, the, grandeur, of, the, valois, monarchy, through, a, series, of, costly, building, projects, these, included, work, on, the, ch, teau, de, montceaux, ch, teau, de, saint, maur, and, chenonceau, catherine, built, two, new, palaces, in, paris, the, tuileries, and, the, h, tel, de, la, reine, she, was, closely, involved, in, the, planning, and, supervising, of, all, her, architectural, schemes, catherine, had, emblems, of, her, love, and, grief, carved, into, the, stonework, of, her, buildings, poets, lauded, her, as, the, new, artemisia, after, artemisia, ii, of, caria, who, built, the, mausoleum, at, halicarnassus, as, a, tomb, for, her, dead, husband, as, the, centrepiece, of, an, ambitious, new, chapel, she, commissioned, a, magnificent, tomb, for, henry, at, the, basilica, of, saint, denis, it, was, designed, by, francesco, primaticcio, 1504, 1570, with, sculpture, by, germain, pilon, 1528, 1590, art, historian, henri, zerner, has, called, this, monument, the, last, and, most, brilliant, of, the, royal, tombs, of, the, renaissance, catherine, also, commissioned, germain, pilon, to, carve, the, marble, sculpture, that, contains, henry, ii, s, heart, a, poem, by, ronsard, engraved, on, its, base, tells, the, reader, not, to, wonder, that, so, small, a, vase, can, hold, so, large, a, heart, since, henry, s, real, heart, resides, in, catherine, s, breast, although, catherine, spent, ruinous, sums, on, the, arts, most, of, her, patronage, left, no, permanent, legacy, the, end, of, the, valois, dynasty, so, soon, after, her, death, brought, a, change, in, priorities, the, legend, that, de, medici, introduced, a, long, list, of, foods, techniques, and, utensils, from, italy, to, france, is, discredited, by, food, historians, barbara, ketcham, wheaton, and, stephen, mennell, provided, the, definitive, arguments, against, these, claims, they, point, out, that, catherine, s, father, in, law, king, francis, i, and, the, flower, of, the, french, aristocracy, had, dined, at, some, of, italy, s, most, lite, tables, during, the, king, s, italian, campaigns, and, that, an, earlier, generation, had, done, so, during, king, charles, viii, s, invasion, of, 1494, that, a, vast, italian, entourage, had, visited, france, for, the, wedding, of, catherine, de, medici, s, father, to, her, french, born, mother, and, that, she, had, little, influence, at, court, until, her, husband, s, death, because, he, was, so, besotted, by, his, mistress, diane, de, poitiers, in, fact, a, large, population, of, italians, bankers, silk, weavers, philosophers, musicians, and, artists, including, leonardo, da, vinci, had, emigrated, to, france, to, promote, the, burgeoning, renaissance, nevertheless, popular, culture, frequently, attributes, italian, culinary, influence, and, forks, in, france, to, catherine, the, earliest, known, reference, to, catherine, as, the, popularizer, of, italian, culinary, innovation, is, the, entry, for, cuisine, in, diderot, and, d, alembert, s, encyclop, die, published, in, 1754, which, describes, haute, cuisine, as, decadent, and, effeminate, and, explains, that, fussy, sauces, and, fancy, fricassees, arrived, in, france, via, that, crowd, of, corrupt, italians, who, served, at, the, court, of, catherine, de, medici, catherine, de, medici, has, been, labelled, by, wiccan, gerald, gardner, a, sinister, queen, noted, for, her, interest, in, the, occult, arts, catherine, and, henry, s, inability, to, produce, an, heir, for, the, first, ten, years, of, their, marriage, gave, rise, to, suspicion, of, witchcraft, labouvie, suggested, that, women, s, power, was, believed, to, be, the, ability, to, create, and, sustain, life, whilst, witches, were, believed, to, have, the, opposite, power, that, of, attacking, health, life, and, fertility, an, infertile, woman, and, in, particular, an, infertile, queen, was, therefore, regarded, as, unnatural, and, a, small, step, from, supernatural, essentially, however, there, exists, no, concrete, proof, that, she, took, part, in, the, occult, and, it, is, now, believed, that, catherine, s, trouble, in, providing, an, heir, was, in, fact, due, to, henry, ii, s, penile, deformity, catherine, herself, had, been, educated, by, cosimo, ruggeri, in, astrology, and, astronomy, which, were, closely, linked, in, her, day, and, were, an, academic, rather, than, a, satanic, activity, although, his, general, background, and, favourite, status, suggests, there, was, more, to, it, than, that, it, has, been, suggested, that, catherine, educated, her, son, henry, iii, in, the, dark, arts, and, that, the, two, devoted, themselves, to, sorceries, that, were, scandals, of, the, age, as, a, result, some, more, extreme, authors, believe, catherine, to, be, the, creator, of, the, black, mass, a, satanic, inversion, of, the, traditional, catholic, mass, although, there, is, little, to, prove, this, aside, from, jean, bodin, s, account, in, his, book, de, la, d, monomanie, des, sorciers, nevertheless, catherine, was, never, formally, accused, or, prosecuted, despite, the, fact, that, her, reign, experienced, the, greatest, number, of, prosecutions, for, witchcraft, in, italy, this, lends, some, weight, to, the, suggestion, that, people, were, labelled, witches, simply, because, they, did, not, act, the, way, a, woman, would, have, been, expected, to, act, or, simply, to, suit, personal, or, political, agendas, this, may, be, particularly, true, for, catherine, as, an, italian, woman, ruling, in, france, several, historians, argue, that, she, was, disliked, by, her, french, subjects, who, labelled, her, the, italian, woman, in, any, event, the, rumours, have, made, a, mark, on, catherine, s, reputation, over, time, and, there, are, now, many, dramaticised, works, about, her, involvement, in, the, occult, catherine, de, medici, married, henry, duke, of, orl, ans, the, future, henry, ii, of, france, in, marseille, on, 28, october, 1533, she, gave, birth, to, ten, children, of, whom, four, sons, and, three, daughters, survived, to, marriageable, age, three, of, her, sons, became, kings, of, france, while, two, of, her, daughters, married, kings, and, one, married, a, duke, catherine, outlived, all, her, children, except, henry, iii, who, died, seven, months, after, her, and, margaret, who, inherited, her, robust, health, victoire, and, jeanne, were, twin, daughters, born, in, 1556, jeanne, was, stillborn, due, to, surgeons, breaking, her, legs, to, save, her, mother, s, life, victoire, survived, dying, less, than, two, months, later, according, to, the, diplomat, simon, renard, the, birth, nearly, killed, catherine, and, the, royal, couple, were, advised, by, the, king, s, physician, to, have, no, further, children
