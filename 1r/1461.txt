through, colonising, territories, to, the, east, goebbels, was, horrified, by, hitler, s, characterisation, of, socialism, as, a, jewish, creation, and, his, assertion, that, a, nazi, government, would, not, expropriate, private, property, he, wrote, in, his, diary, i, no, longer, fully, believe, in, hitler, that, s, the, terrible, thing, my, inner, support, has, been, taken, away, after,

bolshevism, or, national, socialism, lenin, or, hitler, in, which, he, asserted, that, communism, or, marxism, could, not, save, the, german, people, but, he, believed, it, would, cause, a, socialist, nationalist, state, to, arise, in, russia, in, 1926, goebbels, published, a, pamphlet, titled, nazi, sozi, which, attempted, to, explain, how, national, socialism, differed, from, marxism, in, hopes,

i, love, him, he, has, thought, through, everything, such, a, sparkling, mind, can, be, my, leader, i, bow, to, the, greater, one, the, political, genius, he, later, wrote, adolf, hitler, i, love, you, because, you, are, both, great, and, simple, at, the, same, time, what, one, calls, a, genius, as, a, result, of, the, bamberg, and, munich, meetings, the, national, socialist, working, association, was, disbanded, strasser, s, new, draft, of, the, party, programme, was, discarded, the, original, national, socialist, program, of, 1920, was, retained, unchanged, and, hitler, s,

for, the, following, year, s, event, goebbels, was, involved, in, the, planning, for, the, first, time, he, and, hitler, arranged, for, the, rally, to, be, filmed, receiving, praise, for, doing, well, at, these, events, led, goebbels, to, shape, his, political, ideas, to, match, hitler, s, and, to, admire, and, idolise, him, even, more, goebbels, was, first, offered, the, position, of, party, gauleiter, for, the, berlin, section, in, august, 1926, he, travelled, to, berlin, in, mid, september, and, by, the, middle, of, october, accepted, the, position, thus, hitler, s, plan, to, divide, and, dissolve, the, northwestern, gauleiters, group, that, goebbels, had, served, in, under, strasser, was, successful, hitler, gave, goebbels, great, authority, over, the, area, allowing, him, to, determine, the, course, for, organisation, and, leadership, for, the, gau, goebbels, was, given, control, over, the, local, sturmabteilung, sa, and, schutzstaffel, ss, and, answered, only, to, hitler, the, party, membership, numbered, about, 1, 000, when, goebbels, arrived, and, he, reduced, it, to, a, core, of, 600, of, the, most, active, and, promising, members, to, raise, money, he, instituted, membership, fees, and, began, charging, admission, to, party, meetings, aware, of, the, value, of, publicity, both, positive, and, negative, he, deliberately, provoked, beer, hall, battles, and, street, brawls, including, violent, attacks, on, the, communist, party, of, germany, kpd, goebbels, adapted, recent, developments, in, commercial, advertising, to, the, political, sphere, including, the, use, of, catchy, slogans, and, subliminal, cues, his, new, ideas, for, poster, design, included, using, large, type, red, ink, and, cryptic, headers, that, encouraged, the, reader, to, examine, the, fine, print, to, determine, the, meaning, like, hitler, goebbels, practised, his, public, speaking, skills, in, front, of, a, mirror, meetings, were, preceded, by, ceremonial, marches, and, singing, and, the, venues, were, decorated, with, party, banners, his, entrance, almost, always, late, was, timed, for, maximum, emotional, impact, goebbels, usually, meticulously, planned, his, speeches, ahead, of, time, using, pre, planned, and, choreographed, inflection, and, gestures, but, he, was, also, able, to, improvise, and, adapt, his, presentation, to, make, a, good, connection, with, his, audience, he, used, loudspeakers, decorative, flames, uniforms, and, marches, to, attract, attention, to, speeches, goebbels, tactic, of, using, provocation, to, bring, attention, to, the, nazi, party, along, with, violence, at, the, public, party, meetings, and, demonstrations, led, the, berlin, police, to, ban, the, nazi, party, from, the, city, on, 5, may, 1927, violent, incidents, continued, including, young, nazis, randomly, attacking, jews, in, the, streets, goebbels, was, subjected, to, a, public, speaking, ban, until, the, end, of, october, during, this, period, he, founded, the, newspaper, der, angriff, the, attack, as, a, propaganda, vehicle, for, the, berlin, area, where, few, supported, the, party, it, was, a, modern, style, newspaper, with, an, aggressive, tone, 126, libel, suits, were, pending, against, goebbels, at, one, point, to, his, disappointment, circulation, was, initially, only, 2, 000, material, in, the, paper, was, highly, anti, communist, and, antisemitic, among, the, paper, s, favourite, targets, was, the, jewish, deputy, chief, of, the, berlin, police, bernhard, wei, goebbels, gave, him, the, derogatory, nickname, isidore, and, subjected, him, to, a, relentless, campaign, of, jew, baiting, in, the, hope, of, provoking, a, crackdown, he, could, then, exploit, goebbels, continued, to, try, to, break, into, the, literary, world, with, a, revised, version, of, his, book, michael, finally, being, published, and, the, unsuccessful, production, of, two, of, his, plays, der, wanderer, and, die, saat, the, seed, the, latter, was, his, final, attempt, at, playwriting, during, this, period, in, berlin, he, had, relationships, with, many, women, including, his, old, flame, anka, stalherm, who, was, now, married, and, had, a, small, child, he, was, quick, to, fall, in, love, but, easily, tired, of, a, relationship, and, moved, on, to, someone, new, he, worried, too, about, how, a, committed, personal, relationship, might, interfere, with, his, career, the, ban, on, the, nazi, party, was, lifted, before, the, reichstag, elections, on, 20, may, 1928, the, nazi, party, lost, nearly, 100, 000, voters, and, earned, only, 2, 6, per, cent, of, the, vote, nationwide, results, in, berlin, were, even, worse, where, they, attained, only, 1, 4, per, cent, of, the, vote, goebbels, was, one, of, the, first, 12, nazi, party, members, to, gain, election, to, the, reichstag, this, gave, him, immunity, from, prosecution, for, a, long, list, of, outstanding, charges, including, a, three, week, jail, sentence, he, received, in, april, for, insulting, the, deputy, police, chief, wei, the, reichstag, changed, the, immunity, regulations, in, february, 1931, and, goebbels, was, forced, to, pay, fines, for, libellous, material, he, had, placed, in, der, angriff, over, the, course, of, the, previous, year, goebbels, continued, to, be, elected, to, the, reichstag, at, every, subsequent, election, during, the, weimar, and, nazi, regimes, in, his, newspaper, berliner, arbeiterzeitung, berlin, workers, newspaper, gregor, strasser, was, highly, critical, of, goebbels, failure, to, attract, the, urban, vote, however, the, party, as, a, whole, did, much, better, in, rural, areas, attracting, as, much, as, 18, per, cent, of, the, vote, in, some, regions, this, was, partly, because, hitler, had, publicly, stated, just, prior, to, the, election, that, point, 17, of, the, party, programme, which, mandated, the, expropriation, of, land, without, compensation, would, apply, only, to, jewish, speculators, and, not, private, landholders, after, the, election, the, party, refocused, their, efforts, to, try, to, attract, still, more, votes, in, the, agricultural, sector, in, may, shortly, after, the, election, hitler, considered, appointing, goebbels, as, party, propaganda, chief, but, he, hesitated, as, he, worried, that, the, removal, of, gregor, strasser, from, the, post, would, lead, to, a, split, in, the, party, goebbels, considered, himself, well, suited, to, the, position, and, began, to, formulate, ideas, about, how, propaganda, could, be, used, in, schools, and, the, media, by, 1930, berlin, was, the, party, s, second, strongest, base, of, support, after, munich, that, year, the, violence, between, the, nazis, and, communists, led, to, local, sa, troop, leader, horst, wessel, being, shot, by, two, members, of, the, kpd, he, later, died, in, hospital, exploiting, wessel, s, death, goebbels, turned, him, into, a, martyr, for, the, nazi, movement, he, officially, declared, wessel, s, march, die, fahne, hoch, raise, the, flag, renamed, as, the, horst, wessel, lied, to, be, the, nazi, party, anthem, the, great, depression, greatly, impacted, germany, and, by, 1930, there, was, a, dramatic, increase, in, unemployment, during, this, time, the, strasser, brothers, started, publishing, a, new, daily, newspaper, in, berlin, the, nationaler, sozialist, like, their, other, publications, it, conveyed, the, brothers, own, brand, of, nazism, including, nationalism, anti, capitalism, social, reform, and, anti, westernism, goebbels, complained, vehemently, about, the, rival, strasser, newspapers, to, hitler, and, admitted, that, their, success, was, causing, his, own, berlin, newspapers, to, be, pushed, to, the, wall, in, late, april, 1930, hitler, publicly, and, firmly, announced, his, opposition, to, gregor, strasser, and, appointed, goebbels, to, replace, him, as, reich, leader, of, nazi, party, propaganda, one, of, goebbels, first, acts, was, to, ban, the, evening, edition, of, the, nationaler, sozialist, goebbels, was, also, given, control, of, other, nazi, papers, across, the, country, including, the, party, s, national, newspaper, the, v, lkischer,

to, the, german, economy, he, proposed, a, new, german, society, based, on, race, and, national, unity, the, resulting, success, took, even, hitler, and, goebbels, by, surprise, the, party, received,

receive, like, other, nazi, party, officials, goebbels, had, to, deal, with, hitler, s, leadership, style, of, giving, contradictory, orders, to, his, subordinates, while, placing, them, into, positions, where, their, duties, and, responsibilities, overlapped, in, this, way, hitler, fostered, distrust, competition, and, infighting, among, his, subordinates, to, consolidate, and, maximise, his, own, power, the, nazi, party, took, advantage, of, the, reichstag, fire, of, 27, february, 1933, with, hindenburg, passing, the, reichstag, fire, decree, the, following, day, at, hitler, s, urging, this, was, the, first, of, several, pieces, of, legislation, that, dismantled, democracy, in, germany, and, put, a, totalitarian, dictatorship, headed, by, hitler, in, its, place, on, 5, march, yet, another, reichstag, election, took, place, the, last, to, be, held, before, the, defeat, of, the, nazis, at, the, end, of, the, second, world, war, while, the, nazi, party, increased,

films, and, film, censorship, art, music, and, theatre, and, protection, against, counter, propaganda, both, foreign, and, domestic, goebbels, s, style, of, leadership, was, tempestuous, and, unpredictable, he, would, suddenly, change, direction, and, shift, his, support, between, senior, associates, he, was, a, difficult, boss, and, liked, to, berate, his, staff, in, public, goebbels, was, successful, at, his, job, however, life, wrote, in, 1938, that, ersonally, he, likes, nobody, is, liked, by, nobody, and, runs, the, most, efficient, nazi, department, john, gunther, wrote, in, 1940, that, goebbels, is, the, cleverest, of, all, the, nazis, but, could, not, succeed, hitler, because, everybody, hates, him, the, reich, film, chamber, which, all, members, of, the, film, industry, were, required, to, join, was, created, in, june, 1933, goebbels, promoted, the, development, of, films, with, a, nazi, slant, and, ones, that, contained, subliminal, or, overt, propaganda, messages, under, the, auspices, of, the, reichskulturkammer, reich, chamber, of, culture, created, in, september, goebbels, added, additional, sub, chambers, for, the, fields, of, broadcasting, fine, arts, literature, music, the, press, and, the, theatre, as, in, the, film, industry, anyone, wishing, to, pursue, a, career, in, these, fields, had, to, be, a, member, of, the, corresponding, chamber, in, this, way, anyone, whose, views, were, contrary, to, the, regime, could, be, excluded, from, working, in, their, chosen, field, and, thus, silenced, in, addition, journalists, now, considered, employees, of, the, state, were, required, to, prove, aryan, descent, back, to, the, year, 1800, and, if, married, the, same, requirement, applied, to, the, spouse, members, of, any, chamber, were, not, allowed, to, leave, the, country, for, their, work, without, prior, permission, of, their, chamber, a, committee, was, established, to, censor, books, and, works, could, not, be, re, published, unless, they, were, on, the, list, of, approved, works, similar, regulations, applied, to, other, fine, arts, and, entertainment, even, cabaret, performances, were, censored, many, german, artists, and, intellectuals, left, germany, in, the, pre, war, years, rather, than, work, under, these, restrictions, goebbels, was, particularly, interested, in, controlling, the, radio, which, was, then, still, a, fairly, new, mass, medium, sometimes, under, protest, from, individual, states, particularly, prussia, headed, by, g, ring, goebbels, gained, control, of, radio, stations, nationwide, and, placed, them, under, the, reichs, rundfunk, gesellschaft, german, national, broadcasting, corporation, in, july, 1934, manufacturers, were, urged, by, goebbels, to, produce, inexpensive, home, receivers, called, volksempf, nger, people, s, receiver, and, by, 1938, nearly, ten, million, sets, had, been, sold, loudspeakers, were, placed, in, public, areas, factories, and, schools, so, that, important, party, broadcasts, would, be, heard, live, by, nearly, all, germans, on, 2, september, 1939, the, day, after, the, start, of, the, war, goebbels, and, the, council, of, ministers, proclaimed, it, illegal, to, listen, to, foreign, radio, stations, disseminating, news, from, foreign, broadcasts, could, result, in, the, death, penalty, albert, speer, hitler, s, architect, and, later, minister, for, armaments, and, war, production, later, said, the, regime, made, the, complete, use, of, all, technical, means, for, domination, of, its, own, country, through, technical, devices, like, the, radio, and, loudspeaker, 80, million, people, were, deprived, of, independent, thought, a, major, focus, of, nazi, propaganda, was, hitler, himself, who, was, glorified, as, a, heroic, and, infallible, leader, and, became, the, focus, of, a, cult, of, personality, much, of, this, was, spontaneous, but, some, was, stage, managed, as, part, of, goebbels, propaganda, work, adulation, of, hitler, was, the, focus, of, the, 1934, nuremberg, rally, where, his, moves, were, carefully, choreographed, the, rally, was, the, subject, of, the, film, triumph, of, the, will, one, of, several, nazi, propaganda, films, directed, by, leni, riefenstahl, it, won, the, gold, medal, at, the, 1935, venice, film, festival, at, the, 1935, nazi, party, congress, rally, at, nuremberg, goebbels, declared, that, bolshevism, is, the, declaration, of, war, by, jewish, led, international, subhumans, against, culture, itself, goebbels, was, involved, in, planning, the, staging, of, the, 1936, summer, olympics, held, in, berlin, it, was, around, this, time, that, he, met, and, started, having, an, affair, with, the, actress, l, da, baarov, whom, he, continued, to, see, until, 1938, a, major, project, in, 1937, was, the, degenerate, art, exhibition, organised, by, goebbels, which, ran, in, munich, from, july, to, november, the, exhibition, proved, wildly, popular, attracting, over, two, million, visitors, a, degenerate, music, exhibition, took, place, the, following, year, meanwhile, goebbels, was, disappointed, by, the, lack, of, quality, in, the, national, socialist, artwork, films, and, literature, in, 1933, hitler, signed, the, reichskonkordat, reich, concordat, a, treaty, with, the, vatican, that, required, the, regime, to, honour, the, independence, of, catholic, institutions, and, prohibited, clergy, from, involvement, in, politics, however, the, regime, continued, to, target, the, christian, churches, to, weaken, their, influence, throughout, 1935, and, 1936, hundreds, of, clergy, and, nuns, were, arrested, often, on, trumped, up, charges, of, currency, smuggling, or, sexual, offences, goebbels, widely, publicised, the, trials, in, his, propaganda, campaigns, showing, the, cases, in, the, worst, possible, light, restrictions, were, placed, on, public, meetings, and, catholic, publications, faced, censorship, catholic, schools, were, required, to, reduce, religious, instruction, and, crucifixes, were, removed, from, state, buildings, hitler, often, vacillated, on, whether, or, not, the, kirchenkampf, church, struggle, should, be, a, priority, but, his, frequent, inflammatory, comments, on, the, issue, were, enough, to, convince, goebbels, to, intensify, his, work, on, the, issue, in, february, 1937, he, stated, he, wanted, to, eliminate, the, protestant, church, in, response, to, the, persecution, pope, pius, xi, had, the, mit, brennender, sorge, with, burning, concern, encyclical, smuggled, into, germany, for, passion, sunday, 1937, and, read, from, every, pulpit, it, denounced, the, systematic, hostility, of, the, regime, toward, the, church, in, response, goebbels, renewed, the, regime, s, crackdown, and, propaganda, against, catholics, his, speech, of, 28, may, in, berlin, in, front, of, 20, 000, party, members, which, was, also, broadcast, on, the, radio, attacked, the, catholic, church, as, morally, corrupt, as, a, result, of, the, propaganda, campaign, enrolment, in, denominational, schools, dropped, sharply, and, by, 1939, all, such, schools, were, disbanded, or, converted, to, public, facilities, harassment, and, threats, of, imprisonment, led, the, clergy, to, be, much, more, cautious, in, their, criticism, of, the, regime, partly, out, of, foreign, policy, concerns, hitler, ordered, a, scaling, back, of, the, church, struggle, by, the, end, of, july, 1937, goebbels, was, antisemitic, from, a, young, age, after, joining, the, nazi, party, and, meeting, hitler, his, antisemitism, grew, and, became, more, radical, he, began, to, see, the, jews, as, a, destructive, force, with, a, negative, impact, on, german, society, in, 1930, he, criticised, italian, fascist, dictator, benito, mussolini, for, his, relative, lack, of, hostility, towards, jews, stating, that, mussolini, appears, to, have, not, recognized, the, jewish, question, after, the, nazis, seized, control, he, repeatedly, urged, hitler, to, take, action, against, the, jews, despite, his, extreme, antisemitism, goebbels, spoke, of, the, rubbish, of, race, materialism, and, of, the, unnecessity, of, biological, racism, for, the, nazi, ideology, he, also, described, himmler, s, ideology, as, in, many, regards, mad, and, thought, alfred, rosenberg, s, racial, theories, were, ridiculous, the, nazi, party, s, goal, was, to, remove, jews, from, german, cultural, and, economic, life, and, eventually, to, remove, them, from, the, country, altogether, in, addition, to, his, propaganda, efforts, goebbels, actively, promoted, the, persecution, of, the, jews, through, pogroms, legislation, and, other, actions, discriminatory, measures, he, instituted, in, berlin, in, the, early, years, of, the, regime, included, bans, against, their, using, public, transport, and, requiring, that, jewish, shops, be, marked, as, such, in, november, 1938, the, german, diplomat, ernst, vom, rath, was, killed, in, paris, by, the, young, jewish, man, herschel, grynszpan, in, response, goebbels, arranged, for, inflammatory, antisemitic, material, to, be, released, by, the, press, and, the, result, was, the, start, of, a, pogrom, jews, were, attacked, and, synagogues, destroyed, all, over, germany, the, situation, was, further, inflamed, by, a, speech, goebbels, gave, at, a, party, meeting, on, the, night, of, 8, november, where, he, obliquely, called, for, party, members, to, incite, further, violence, against, jews, while, making, it, appear, to, be, a, spontaneous, series, of, acts, by, the, german, people, at, least, a, hundred, jews, were, killed, several, hundred, synagogues, were, damaged, or, destroyed, and, thousands, of, jewish, shops, were, vandalised, in, an, event, called, kristallnacht, night, of, broken, glass, around, 30, 000, jewish, men, were, sent, to, concentration, camps, the, destruction, stopped, after, a, conference, held, on, 12, november, where, g, ring, pointed, out, that, the, destruction, of, jewish, property, was, in, effect, the, destruction, of, german, property, since, the, intention, was, that, it, would, all, eventually, be, confiscated, goebbels, continued, his, intensive, antisemitic, propaganda, campaign, that, culminated, in, hitler, s, 30, january, 1939, reichstag, speech, which, goebbels, helped, to, write, if, international, finance, jewry, in, and, outside, europe, should, succeed, in, plunging, the, nations, once, more, into, a, world, war, then, the, result, will, not, be, the, bolshevization, of, the, earth, and, thereby, the, victory, of, jewry, but, the, annihilation, of, the, jewish, race, in, europe, while, goebbels, had, been, pressing, for, expulsion, of, the, berlin, jews, since, 1935, there, were, still, 62, 000, living, in, the, city, in, 1940, part, of, the, delay, in, their, deportation, was, that, they, were, needed, as, workers, in, the, armaments, industry, deportations, of, german, jews, began, in, october, 1941, with, the, first, transport, from, berlin, leaving, on, 18, october, some, jews, were, shot, immediately, on, arrival, in, destinations, such, as, riga, and, kaunas, in, preparation, for, the, deportations, goebbels, ordered, that, all, german, jews, wear, an, identifying, yellow, badge, as, of, 5, september, 1941, on, 6, march, 1942, goebbels, received, a, copy, of, the, minutes, of, the, wannsee, conference, which, indicated, indirectly, that, the, jewish, population, of, europe, was, to, be, sent, to, extermination, camps, in, occupied, areas, of, poland, and, killed, his, diary, entries, of, the, period, show, that, he, was, well, aware, of, the, fate, of, the, jews, in, general, it, can, probably, be, established, that, 60, per, cent, of, them, will, have, to, be, liquidated, while, only, 40, per, cent, can, be, put, to, work, a, judgment, is, being, carried, out, on, the, jews, which, is, barbaric, but, thoroughly, deserved, he, wrote, on, 27, march, 1942, goebbels, had, frequent, discussions, with, hitler, about, the, fate, of, the, jews, a, subject, they, discussed, almost, every, time, they, met, he, was, aware, throughout, that, the, jews, were, being, exterminated, and, completely, supported, this, decision, he, was, one, of, the, few, top, nazi, officials, to, do, so, publicly, as, early, as, february, 1933, hitler, announced, that, rearmament, must, be, undertaken, albeit, clandestinely, at, first, as, to, do, so, was, in, violation, of, the, versailles, treaty, a, year, later, he, told, his, military, leaders, that, 1942, was, the, target, date, for, going, to, war, in, the, east, goebbels, was, one, of, the, most, enthusiastic, supporters, of, hitler, aggressively, pursuing, germany, s, expansionist, policies, sooner, rather, than, later, at, the, time, of, the, reoccupation, of, the, rhineland, in, 1936, goebbels, summed, up, his, general, attitude, in, his, diary, ow, is, the, time, for, action, fortune, favors, the, brave, he, who, dares, nothing, wins, nothing, in, the, lead, up, to, the, sudetenland, crisis, in, 1938, goebbels, took, the, initiative, time, and, again, to, use, propaganda, to, whip, up, sympathy, for, the, sudeten, germans, while, campaigning, against, the, czech, government, still, goebbels, was, well, aware, there, was, a, growing, war, panic, in, germany, and, so, by, july, had, the, press, conduct, propaganda, efforts, at, a, lower, level, of, intensity, after, the, western, powers, acceded, to, hitler, s, demands, concerning, czechoslovakia, in, 1938, goebbels, soon, redirected, his, propaganda, machine, against, poland, from, may, onwards, he, orchestrated, a, campaign, against, poland, fabricating, stories, about, atrocities, against, ethnic, germans, in, danzig, and, other, cities, even, so, he, was, unable, to, persuade, the, majority, of, germans, to, welcome, the, prospect, of, war, he, privately, held, doubts, about, the, wisdom, of, risking, a, protracted, war, against, britain, and, france, by, attacking, poland, after, the, invasion, of, poland, in, september, 1939, goebbels, used, his, propaganda, ministry, and, the, reich, chambers, to, control, access, to, information, domestically, to, his, chagrin, his, rival, joachim, von, ribbentrop, the, minister, for, foreign, affairs, continually, challenged, goebbels, jurisdiction, over, the, dissemination, of, international, propaganda, hitler, declined, to, make, a, firm, ruling, on, the, subject, so, the, two, men, remained, rivals, for, the, remainder, of, the, nazi, era, goebbels, did, not, participate, in, the, military, decision, making, process, nor, was, he, made, privy, to, diplomatic, negotiations, until, after, the, fact, the, propaganda, ministry, took, over, the, broadcasting, facilities, of, conquered, countries, immediately, after, surrender, and, began, broadcasting, prepared, material, using, the, existing, announcers, as, a, way, to, gain, the, trust, of, the, citizens, most, aspects, of, the, media, both, domestically, and, in, the, conquered, countries, were, controlled, by, goebbels, and, his, department, the, german, home, service, the, armed, forces, programme, and, the, german, european, service, were, all, rigorously, controlled, in, everything, from, the, information, they, were, permitted, to, disseminate, to, the, music, they, were, allowed, to, play, party, rallies, speeches, and, demonstrations, continued, speeches, were, broadcast, on, the, radio, and, short, propaganda, films, were, exhibited, using, 1, 500, mobile, film, vans, hitler, made, fewer, public, appearances, and, broadcasts, as, the, war, progressed, so, goebbels, increasingly, became, the, voice, of, the, nazi, regime, for, the, german, people, from, may, 1940, he, wrote, frequent, editorials, that, were, published, in, das, reich, which, were, later, read, aloud, over, the, radio, he, found, films, to, be, his, most, effective, propaganda, medium, after, radio, at, his, insistence, initially, half, the, films, made, in, wartime, germany, were, propaganda, films, particularly, on, antisemitism, and, war, propaganda, films, recounting, both, historical, wars, and, current, exploits, of, the, wehrmacht, goebbels, became, preoccupied, with, morale, and, the, efforts, of, the, people, on, the, home, front, he, believed, that, the, more, the, people, at, home, were, involved, in, the, war, effort, the, better, their, morale, would, be, for, example, he, initiated, a, programme, for, the, collection, of, winter, clothing, and, ski, equipment, for, troops, on, the, eastern, front, at, the, same, time, goebbels, implemented, changes, to, have, more, entertaining, material, in, radio, and, film, produced, for, the, public, decreeing, in, late, 1942, that, 20, per, cent, of, the, films, should, be, propaganda, and, 80, per, cent, light, entertainment, as, gauleiter, of, berlin, goebbels, dealt, with, increasingly, serious, shortages, of, necessities, such, as, food, and, clothing, as, well, as, the, need, to, ration, beer, and, tobacco, which, were, important, for, morale, hitler, suggested, watering, the, beer, and, degrading, the, quality, of, the, cigarettes, so, that, more, could, be, produced, but, goebbels, refused, saying, the, cigarettes, were, already, of, such, low, quality, that, it, was, impossible, to, make, them, any, worse, through, his, propaganda, campaigns, he, worked, hard, to, maintain, an, appropriate, level, of, morale, among, the, public, about, the, military, situation, neither, too, optimistic, nor, too, grim, the, series, of, military, setbacks, the, germans, suffered, in, this, period, the, thousand, bomber, raid, on, cologne, may, 1942, the, allied, victory, at, the, second, battle, of, el, alamein, november, 1942, and, especially, the, catastrophic, defeat, at, the, battle, of, stalingrad, february, 1943, were, difficult, matters, to, present, to, the, german, public, who, were, increasingly, weary, of, the, war, and, sceptical, that, it, could, be, won, on, 16, november, 1942, goebbels, like, all, gauleiters, was, appointed, the, reich, defense, commissioner, for, his, gau, this, enabled, him, to, issue, direct, instructions, to, authorities, within, his, jurisdiction, in, matters, concerning, the, civilian, war, effort, on, 15, january, 1943, hitler, appointed, goebbels, as, head, of, the, newly, created, air, raid, damage, committee, which, meant, goebbels, was, nominally, in, charge, of, nationwide, civil, air, defences, and, shelters, as, well, as, the, assessment, and, repair, of, damaged, buildings, in, actuality, the, defence, of, areas, other, than, berlin, remained, in, the, hands, of, the, local, gauleiters, and, his, main, tasks, were, limited, to, providing, immediate, aid, to, the, affected, civilians, and, using, propaganda, to, improve, their, morale, by, early, 1943, the, war, produced, a, labour, crisis, for, the, regime, hitler, created, a, three, man, committee, with, representatives, of, the, state, the, army, and, the, party, in, an, attempt, to, centralise, control, of, the, war, economy, the, committee, members, were, hans, lammers, head, of, the, reich, chancellery, field, marshal, wilhelm, keitel, chief, of, the, oberkommando, der, wehrmacht, armed, forces, high, command, okw, and, martin, bormann, who, controlled, the, party, the, committee, was, intended, to, independently, propose, measures, regardless, of, the, wishes, of, various, ministries, with, hitler, reserving, most, final, decisions, to, himself, the, committee, soon, known, as, the, dreierausschu, committee, of, three, met, eleven, times, between, january, and, august, 1943, however, they, ran, up, against, resistance, from, hitler, s, cabinet, ministers, who, headed, deeply, entrenched, spheres, of, influence, and, were, excluded, from, the, committee, seeing, it, as, a, threat, to, their, power, goebbels, g, ring, and, speer, worked, together, to, bring, it, down, the, result, was, that, nothing, changed, and, the, committee, of, three, declined, into, irrelevance, by, september, 1943, partly, in, response, to, being, excluded, from, the, committee, of, three, goebbels, pressured, hitler, to, introduce, measures, that, would, produce, total, war, including, closing, businesses, not, essential, to, the, war, effort, conscripting, women, into, the, labour, force, and, enlisting, men, in, previously, exempt, occupations, into, the, wehrmacht, some, of, these, measures, were, implemented, in, an, edict, of, 13, january, but, to, goebbels, dismay, g, ring, demanded, that, his, favourite, restaurants, in, berlin, should, remain, open, and, lammers, successfully, lobbied, hitler, to, have, women, with, children, exempted, from, conscription, even, if, they, had, child, care, available, after, receiving, an, enthusiastic, response, to, his, speech, of, 30, january, 1943, on, the, topic, goebbels, believed, he, had, the, support, of, the, german, people, in, his, call, for, total, war, his, next, speech, the, sportpalast, speech, of, 18, february, 1943, was, a, passionate, demand, for, his, audience, to, commit, to, total, war, which, he, presented, as, the, only, way, to, stop, the, bolshevik, onslaught, and, save, the, german, people, from, destruction, the, speech, also, had, a, strong, antisemitic, element, and, hinted, at, the, extermination, of, the, jewish, people, that, was, already, underway, the, speech, was, presented, live, on, radio, and, was, filmed, as, well, during, the, live, version, of, the, speech, goebbels, accidentally, begins, to, mention, the, extermination, of, the, jews, this, is, omitted, in, the, published, text, of, the, speech, goebbels, efforts, had, little, impact, for, the, time, being, because, hitler, who, in, principle, was, in, favour, of, total, war, was, not, prepared, to, implement, changes, over, the, objections, of, his, ministers, the, discovery, around, this, time, of, a, mass, grave, of, polish, officers, that, had, been, killed, by, the, red, army, in, the, 1940, katyn, massacre, was, made, use, of, by, goebbels, in, his, propaganda, in, an, attempt, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, soviets, and, the, other, western, allies, after, the, allied, invasion, of, sicily, july, 1943, and, the, strategic, soviet, victory, in, the, battle, of, kursk, july, august, 1943, goebbels, began, to, recognise, that, the, war, could, no, longer, be, won, following, the, allied, invasion, of, italy, and, the, fall, of, mussolini, in, september, he, raised, with, hitler, the, possibility, of, a, separate, peace, either, with, the, soviets, or, with, britain, hitler, rejected, both, of, these, proposals, as, germany, s, military, and, economic, situation, grew, steadily, worse, on, 25, august, 1943, reichsf, hrer, ss, heinrich, himmler, took, over, the, post, of, interior, minister, replacing, wilhelm, frick, intensive, air, raids, on, berlin, and, other, cities, took, the, lives, of, thousands, of, people, in, december, 1943, hitler, asked, goebbels, to, take, on, the, job, of, stadtpr, sident, city, president, of, berlin, and, goebbels, agreed, to, this, as, a, means, of, obtaining, more, direct, control, over, the, municipal, authorities, though, hitler, delayed, the, formal, appointment, for, several, months, goebbels, took, over, direct, administrative, control, of, the, city, when, he, was, formally, named, stadtpr, sident, on, 7, april, 1944, thus, uniting, under, his, control, the, city, s, most, powerful, party, and, governmental, offices, as, air, raids, on, berlin, continued, g, ring, s, luftwaffe, attempted, to, retaliate, with, air, raids, on, london, in, early, 1944, but, they, no, longer, had, sufficient, aircraft, to, make, much, of, an, impact, while, goebbels, propaganda, in, this, period, indicated, that, a, huge, retaliation, was, in, the, offing, the, v, 1, flying, bombs, launched, on, british, targets, beginning, in, mid, june, 1944, had, little, effect, with, only, around, 20, per, cent, reaching, their, intended, targets, to, boost, morale, goebbels, continued, to, publish, propaganda, to, the, effect, that, further, improvements, to, these, weapons, would, have, a, decisive, impact, on, the, outcome, of, the, war, meanwhile, in, the, normandy, landings, of, 6, june, 1944, the, allies, successfully, gained, a, foothold, in, france, throughout, july, 1944, goebbels, and, speer, continued, to, press, hitler, to, bring, the, economy, to, a, total, war, footing, the, 20, july, plot, where, hitler, was, almost, killed, by, a, bomb, at, his, field, headquarters, in, east, prussia, played, into, the, hands, of, those, who, had, been, pushing, for, change, bormann, goebbels, himmler, and, speer, over, the, objections, of, g, ring, goebbels, was, appointed, on, 23, july, as, reich, plenipotentiary, for, total, war, charged, with, maximising, the, manpower, for, the, wehrmacht, and, the, armaments, industry, at, the, expense, of, sectors, of, the, economy, not, critical, to, the, war, effort, through, these, efforts, he, was, able, to, free, up, an, additional, half, a, million, men, for, military, service, however, as, many, of, these, new, recruits, came, from, the, armaments, industry, the, move, put, him, in, conflict, with, armaments, minister, speer, untrained, workers, from, elsewhere, were, not, readily, absorbed, into, the, armaments, industry, and, likewise, the, new, wehrmacht, recruits, waited, in, barracks, for, their, turn, to, be, trained, hitler, ordered, a, nationwide, militia, of, men, previously, considered, unsuitable, for, military, service, the, volkssturm, people, s, storm, to, be, formed, on, 25, september, 1944, it, was, launched, on, 18, october, in, his, capacity, as, gauleiter, and, reich, defense, commissioner, goebbels, was, named, f, hrer, des, deutschen, volkssturms, im, gau, gro, berlin, on, 25, september, 1944, and, he, administered, the, oath, of, allegiance, to, the, assembled, berlin, volkssturm, troops, on, 12, november, goebbels, recorded, in, his, diary, that, 100, 000, recruits, were, sworn, in, from, his, gau, alone, however, the, men, mostly, age, 45, to, 60, received, only, rudimentary, training, and, many, were, not, properly, armed, goebbels, notion, that, these, men, could, effectively, serve, on, the, front, lines, against, soviet, tanks, and, artillery, was, unrealistic, at, best, the, programme, was, deeply, unpopular, goebbels, realised, that, his, influence, would, diminish, in, wartime, he, suffered, a, series, of, setbacks, as, propaganda, became, less, important, compared, to, warfare, the, war, economy, and, the, allied, bombing, of, german, cities, historian, michael, balfour, states, that, from, 1942, onward, goebbels, lost, control, over, nazi, policy, toward, the, press, and, over, the, handling, of, news, in, general, rival, agencies, expanded, the, foreign, ministry, took, charge, of, propaganda, outside, germany, the, military, set, up, its, own, propaganda, division, providing, daily, reports, on, the, progress, of, the, war, and, the, conditions, of, the, armed, forces, the, nazi, party, also, generated, and, distributed, its, own, propaganda, during, the, war, goebbels, was, still, influential, when, he, had, the, opportunity, to, meet, with, hitler, who, became, less, available, as, he, moved, his, headquarters, closer, to, the, military, front, lines, they, were, together, perhaps, one, day, a, month, furthermore, hitler, rarely, gave, speeches, or, rallies, of, the, sort, that, had, dominated, propaganda, in, the, 1930s, after, hitler, returned, to, berlin, in, 1945, goebbels, ministry, was, destroyed, by, an, allied, air, raid, on, 13, march, and, goebbels, had, great, difficulty, disseminating, propaganda, in, april, 1945, he, finally, bested, the, rival, agencies, and, took, full, charge, of, propaganda, but, by, then, the, soviet, red, army, had, already, entered, berlin, goebbels, was, an, astute, observer, of, the, war, and, historians, have, exhaustively, mined, his, diary, for, insights, on, how, the, nazi, leadership, tried, to, maintain, public, morale, in, the, last, months, of, the, war, goebbels, speeches, and, articles, took, on, an, increasingly, apocalyptic, tone, by, the, beginning, of, 1945, with, the, soviets, on, the, oder, river, and, the, western, allies, preparing, to, cross, the, rhine, river, he, could, no, longer, disguise, the, inevitability, of, german, defeat, berlin, had, little, in, the, way, of, fortifications, or, artillery, and, even, volkssturm, units, were, in, short, supply, as, almost, everything, and, everyone, had, been, sent, to, the, front, goebbels, noted, in, his, diary, on, 21, january, that, millions, of, germans, were, fleeing, westward, he, tentatively, discussed, with, hitler, the, issue, of, making, peace, overtures, to, the, western, allies, but, hitler, again, refused, privately, goebbels, was, conflicted, at, pushing, the, case, with, hitler, since, he, did, not, want, to, lose, hitler, s, confidence, when, other, nazi, leaders, urged, hitler, to, leave, berlin, and, establish, a, new, centre, of, resistance, in, the, national, redoubt, in, bavaria, goebbels, opposed, this, arguing, for, a, heroic, last, stand, in, berlin, his, family, except, for, magda, s, son, harald, who, had, served, in, the, luftwaffe, and, been, captured, by, the, allies, moved, into, their, house, in, berlin, to, await, the, end, he, and, magda, may, have, discussed, suicide, and, the, fate, of, their, young, children, in, a, long, meeting, on, the, night, of, 27, january, he, knew, how, the, outside, world, would, view, the, criminal, acts, committed, by, the, regime, and, had, no, desire, to, subject, himself, to, the, debacle, of, a, trial, he, burned, his, private, papers, on, the, night, of, 18, april, goebbels, knew, how, to, play, on, hitler, s, fantasies, encouraging, him, to, see, the, hand, of, providence, in, the, death, of, united, states, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, on, 12, april, whether, hitler, really, saw, this, event, as, a, turning, point, as, goebbels, proclaimed, is, not, known, by, this, time, goebbels, had, gained, the, position, he, had, wanted, so, long, at, hitler, s, side, g, ring, was, utterly, discredited, although, he, was, not, stripped, of, his, offices, until, 23, april, himmler, whose, appointment, as, commander, of, army, group, vistula, had, led, to, disaster, on, the, oder, was, also, in, disgrace, with, hitler, most, of, hitler, s, inner, circle, including, g, ring, himmler, ribbentrop, and, speer, prepared, to, leave, berlin, immediately, after, hitler, s, birthday, celebration, on, 20, april, even, bormann, was, not, anxious, to, meet, his, end, at, hitler, s, side, on, 22, april, hitler, announced, that, he, would, stay, in, berlin, until, the, end, and, then, shoot, himself, goebbels, moved, with, his, family, into, the, vorbunker, connected, to, the, lower, f, hrerbunker, under, the, reich, chancellery, garden, in, central, berlin, that, same, day, he, told, vice, admiral, hans, erich, voss, that, he, would, not, entertain, the, idea, of, either, surrender, or, escape, on, 23, april, goebbels, made, the, following, proclamation, to, the, people, of, berlin, i, call, on, you, to, fight, for, your, city, fight, with, everything, you, have, got, for, the, sake, of, your, wives, and, your, children, your, mothers, and, your, parents, your, arms, are, defending, everything, we, have, ever, held, dear, and, all, the, generations, that, will, come, after, us, be, proud, and, courageous, be, inventive, and, cunning, your, gauleiter, is, amongst, you, he, and, his, colleagues, will, remain, in, your, midst, his, wife, and, children, are, here, as, well, he, who, once, captured, the, city, with, 200, men, will, now, use, every, means, to, galvanize, the, defence, of, the, capital, the, battle, for, berlin, must, become, the, signal, for, the, whole, nation, to, rise, up, in, battle, after, midnight, on, 29, april, with, the, soviets, advancing, ever, closer, to, the, bunker, complex, hitler, married, eva, braun, in, a, small, civil, ceremony, in, the, f, hrerbunker, afterward, he, hosted, a, modest, wedding, breakfast, hitler, then, took, secretary, traudl, junge, to, another, room, and, dictated, his, last, will, and, testament, goebbels, and, bormann, were, two, of, the, witnesses, in, his, last, will, and, testament, hitler, named, no, successor, as, f, hrer, or, leader, of, the, nazi, party, instead, he, appointed, goebbels, as, reich, chancellor, grand, admiral, karl, d, nitz, who, was, at, flensburg, near, the, danish, border, as, reich, president, and, bormann, as, party, minister, goebbels, wrote, a, postscript, to, the, will, stating, that, he, would, categorically, refuse, to, obey, hitler, s, order, to, leave, berlin, as, he, put, it, the, first, time, in, my, life, that, he, had, not, complied, with, hitler, s, orders, he, felt, compelled, to, remain, with, hitler, for, reasons, of, humanity, and, personal, loyalty, his, wife, and, children, would, stay, as, well, they, would, end, their, lives, side, by, side, with, the, f, hrer, in, the, mid, afternoon, of, 30, april, adolf, hitler, shot, himself, goebbels, was, depressed, and, said, he, would, walk, around, the, chancellery, garden, until, he, was, killed, by, the, russian, shelling, voss, later, recounted, goebbels, as, saying, it, is, a, great, pity, that, such, a, man, is, not, with, us, any, longer, but, there, is, nothing, to, be, done, for, us, everything, is, lost, now, and, the, only, way, out, left, for, us, is, the, one, hitler, chose, i, shall, follow, his, example, on, 1, may, goebbels, carried, out, his, sole, official, act, as, chancellor, he, dictated, a, letter, to, general, vasily, chuikov, and, ordered, german, general, hans, krebs, to, deliver, it, under, a, white, flag, chuikov, as, commander, of, the, soviet, 8th, guards, army, commanded, the, soviet, forces, in, central, berlin, goebbels, letter, informed, chuikov, of, hitler, s, death, and, requested, a, ceasefire, after, this, was, rejected, goebbels, decided, that, further, efforts, were, futile, later, on, 1, may, voss, saw, goebbels, for, the, last, time, while, saying, goodbye, i, asked, goebbels, to, join, us, but, he, replied, the, captain, must, not, leave, his, sinking, ship, i, have, thought, about, it, all, and, decided, to, stay, here, i, have, nowhere, to, go, because, with, little, children, i, will, not, be, able, to, make, it, especially, with, a, leg, like, mine, on, the, evening, of, 1, may, goebbels, arranged, for, an, ss, dentist, helmut, kunz, to, inject, his, six, children, with, morphine, so, that, when, they, were, unconscious, an, ampule, of, a, cyanide, compound, could, be, then, crushed, in, each, of, their, mouths, according, to, kunz, s, later, testimony, he, gave, the, children, morphine, injections, but, magda, goebbels, and, ss, obersturmbannf, hrer, ludwig, stumpfegger, hitler, s, personal, doctor, administered, the, cyanide, at, around, 20, 30, goebbels, and, magda, left, the, bunker, and, walked, up, to, the, garden, of, the, chancellery, where, they, killed, themselves, there, are, several, different, accounts, of, this, event, one, is, that, they, each, bit, on, a, cyanide, ampule, near, where, hitler, had, been, buried, and, were, given, a, coup, de, gr, ce, immediately, afterward, goebbels, ss, adjutant, g, nther, schw, germann, testified, in, 1948, that, they, walked, ahead, of,
