pierre, curie, k, j, r, i, kure, ee, french, 15, may, 1859, 19, april, 1906, was, a, french, physicist, a, pioneer, in, crystallography, magnetism, piezoelectricity, and, radioactivity, in, 1903, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, his, wife, marie, sk, odowska, curie, and, henri, becquerel, in, recognition, of, the, extraordinary, services, they, have, rendered, by, their, joint, researches, on, the, radiation, phenomena, discovered, by, professor, henri, becquerel, with, their, win, the, curies, became, the, first, married, couple, to, win, the, nobel, prize, launching, the, curie, family, legacy, of, five, nobel, prizes, born, in, paris, on, 15, may, 1859, pierre, curie, was, the, son, of, eug, ne, curie, 1827, 1910, a, doctor, of, french, huguenot, protestant, origin, from, alsace, and, sophie, claire, curie, n, e, depouilly, 1832, 1897, he, was, educated, by, his, father, and, in, his, early, teens, showed, a, strong, aptitude, for, mathematics, and, geometry, when, he, was, 16, he, earned, his, bachelor, of, science, in, mathematics, by, the, age, of, 18, he, earned, his, license, in, physical, sciences, from, the, faculty, of, sciences, at, the, sorbonne, also, known, as, the, university, of, paris, he, did, not, proceed, immediately, to, a, doctorate, due, to, lack, of, money, instead, he, worked, as, a, laboratory, instructor, when, pierre, curie, was, preparing, for, his, bachelor, of, science, degree, he, worked, in, the, laboratory, of, jean, gustave, bourbouze, in, the, faculty, of, science, in, 1895, he, went, on, to, receive, his, doctorate, at, the, university, of, paris, the, submission, material, for, his, doctorate, consisted, of, his, research, over, magnetism, after, obtaining, his, doctorate, he, became, professor, of, physics, and, in, 1900, he, became, professor, in, the, faculty, of, sciences, in, 1880, pierre, and, his, older, brother, paul, jacques, 1856, 1941, demonstrated, that, an, electric, potential, was, generated, when, crystals, were, compressed, i, e, piezoelectricity, to, aid, this, work, they, invented, the, piezoelectric, quartz, electrometer, the, following, year, they, demonstrated, the, reverse, effect, that, crystals, could, be, made, to, deform, when, subject, to, an, electric, field, almost, all, digital, electronic, circuits, now, rely, on, this, in, the, form, of, crystal, oscillators, in, subsequent, work, on, magnetism, pierre, curie, defined, the, curie, scale, this, work, also, involved, delicate, equipment, balances, electrometers, etc, pierre, curie, was, introduced, to, maria, sk, odowska, by, their, friend, physicist, j, zef, wierusz, kowalski, curie, took, her, into, his, laboratory, as, his, student, his, admiration, for, her, grew, when, he, realized, that, she, would, not, inhibit, his, research, he, began, to, regard, sk, odowska, as, his, muse, she, refused, his, initial, proposal, but, finally, agreed, to, marry, him, on, 26, july, 1895, it, would, be, a, beautiful, thing, a, thing, i, dare, not, hope, if, we, could, spend, our, life, near, each, other, hypnotized, by, our, dreams, your, patriotic, dream, our, humanitarian, dream, and, our, scientific, dream, 117, the, curies, had, a, happy, affectionate, marriage, and, they, were, known, for, their, devotion, to, each, other, before, his, famous, doctoral, studies, on, magnetism, he, designed, and, perfected, an, extremely, sensitive, torsion, balance, for, measuring, magnetic, coefficients, variations, on, this, equipment, were, commonly, used, by, future, workers, in, that, area, pierre, curie, studied, ferromagnetism, paramagnetism, and, diamagnetism, for, his, doctoral, thesis, and, discovered, the, effect, of, temperature, on, paramagnetism, which, is, now, known, as, curie, s, law, the, material, constant, in, curie, s, law, is, known, as, the, curie, constant, he, also, discovered, that, ferromagnetic, substances, exhibited, a, critical, temperature, transition, above, which, the, substances, lost, their, ferromagnetic, behavior, this, is, now, known, as, the, curie, temperature, the, curie, temperature, is, used, to, study, plate, tectonics, treat, hypothermia, measure, caffeine, and, to, understand, extraterrestrial, magnetic, fields, the, curie, is, a, unit, of, measurement, 3, 7, 10, 10, decays, per, second, or, 37, gigabecquerels, used, to, describe, the, intensity, of, a, sample, of, radioactive, material, and, was, named, after, marie, and, pierre, curie, by, the, radiology, congress, in, 1910, pierre, curie, formulated, what, is, now, known, as, the, curie, dissymmetry, principle, a, physical, effect, cannot, have, a, dissymmetry, absent, from, its, efficient, cause, for, example, a, random, mixture, of, sand, in, zero, gravity, has, no, dissymmetry, it, is, isotropic, introduce, a, gravitational, field, and, there, is, a, dissymmetry, because, of, the, direction, of, the, field, then, the, sand, grains, can, self, sort, with, the, density, increasing, with, depth, but, this, new, arrangement, with, the, directional, arrangement, of, sand, grains, actually, reflects, the, dissymmetry, of, the, gravitational, field, that, causes, the, separation, curie, worked, with, his, wife, in, isolating, polonium, and, radium, they, were, the, first, to, use, the, term, radioactivity, and, were, pioneers, in, its, study, their, work, including, marie, curie, s, celebrated, doctoral, work, made, use, of, a, sensitive, piezoelectric, electrometer, constructed, by, pierre, and, his, brother, jacques, curie, pierre, curie, s, 26, december, 1898, publication, with, his, wife, and, m, g, b, mont, for, their, discovery, of, radium, and, polonium, was, honored, by, a, citation, for, chemical, breakthrough, award, from, the, division, of, history, of, chemistry, of, the, american, chemical, society, presented, to, the, espci, paristech, officially, the, cole, sup, rieure, de, physique, et, de, chimie, industrielles, de, la, ville, de, paris, in, 2015, in, 1903, to, honor, the, curies, work, the, royal, society, of, london, invited, pierre, to, present, their, research, marie, curie, was, not, permitted, to, give, the, lecture, so, lord, kelvin, sat, beside, her, while, pierre, spoke, on, their, research, after, this, lord, kelvin, held, a, luncheon, for, pierre, while, in, london, pierre, and, marie, were, awarded, the, davy, medal, of, the, royal, society, of, london, in, the, same, year, pierre, and, marie, curie, as, well, as, henri, becquerel, were, awarded, a, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, their, research, of, radioactivity, curie, and, one, of, his, students, albert, laborde, made, the, first, discovery, of, nuclear, energy, by, identifying, the, continuous, emission, of, heat, from, radium, particles, curie, also, investigated, the, radiation, emissions, of, radioactive, substances, and, through, the, use, of, magnetic, fields, was, able, to, show, that, some, of, the, emissions, were, positively, charged, some, were, negative, and, some, were, neutral, these, correspond, to, alpha, beta, and, gamma, radiation, in, the, late, nineteenth, century, pierre, curie, was, investigating, the, mysteries, of, ordinary, magnetism, when, he, became, aware, of, the, spiritualist, experiments, of, other, european, scientists, such, as, charles, richet, and, camille, flammarion, pierre, curie, initially, thought, the, systematic, investigation, into, the, paranormal, could, help, with, some, unanswered, questions, about, magnetism, 65, he, wrote, to, marie, then, his, fianc, e, i, must, admit, that, those, spiritual, phenomena, intensely, interest, me, i, think, they, are, questions, that, deal, with, physics, 66, pierre, curie, s, notebooks, from, this, period, show, he, read, many, books, on, spiritualism, 68, he, did, not, attend, s, ances, such, as, those, of, eusapia, palladino, in, paris, in, june, 1905, 238, as, a, mere, spectator, and, his, goal, certainly, was, not, to, communicate, with, spirits, he, saw, the, s, ances, as, scientific, experiments, tried, to, monitor, different, parameters, and, took, detailed, notes, of, every, observation, 247, despite, studying, spiritualism, curie, was, an, atheist, pierre, curie, s, grandfather, paul, curie, 1799, 1853, a, doctor, of, medicine, was, a, committed, malthusian, humanist, and, married, augustine, hofer, daughter, of, jean, hofer, and, great, granddaughter, of, jean, henri, dollfus, great, industrialists, from, mulhouse, in, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, the, first, part, of, the, 19th, century, through, this, paternal, grandmother, pierre, curie, is, also, a, direct, descendant, of, the, basel, scientist, and, mathematician, jean, bernoulli, 1667, 1748, as, is, pierre, gilles, de, gennes, winner, of, the, 1991, nobel, prize, in, physics, pierre, and, marie, curie, s, daughter, ir, ne, and, their, son, in, law, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, were, also, physicists, involved, in, the, study, of, radioactivity, and, each, also, received, nobel, prizes, for, their, work, the, curies, other, daughter, ve, wrote, a, noted, biography, of, her, mother, she, was, the, only, member, of, the, curie, family, to, not, become, a, physicist, ve, married, henry, richardson, labouisse, jr, who, received, a, nobel, peace, prize, on, behalf, of, unicef, in, 1965, pierre, and, marie, curie, s, granddaughter, h, l, ne, langevin, joliot, is, a, professor, of, nuclear, physics, at, the, university, of, paris, and, their, grandson, pierre, joliot, who, was, named, after, pierre, curie, is, a, noted, biochemist, pierre, curie, died, in, a, street, collision, in, paris, on, 19, april, 1906, crossing, the, busy, rue, dauphine, in, the, rain, at, the, quai, de, conti, he, slipped, and, fell, under, a, heavy, horse, drawn, cart, one, of, the, wheels, ran, over, his, head, fracturing, his, skull, and, killing, him, instantly, both, the, curies, experienced, radium, burns, both, accidentally, and, voluntarily, and, were, exposed, to, extensive, doses, of, radiation, while, conducting, their, research, they, experienced, radiation, sickness, and, marie, curie, died, from, radiation, induced, aplastic, anemia, in, 1934, even, now, all, their, papers, from, the, 1890s, even, her, cookbooks, are, too, dangerous, to, touch, their, laboratory, books, are, kept, in, special, lead, boxes, and, people, who, want, to, see, them, have, to, wear, protective, clothing, most, of, these, items, can, be, found, at, biblioth, que, nationale, de, france, had, pierre, curie, not, been, killed, in, an, accident, as, he, was, he, would, most, likely, have, eventually, died, of, the, effects, of, radiation, as, did, his, wife, their, daughter, ir, ne, and, her, husband, fr, d, ric, joliot, in, april, 1995, pierre, and, marie, curie, were, moved, from, their, original, resting, place, a, family, cemetery, and, enshrined, in, the, crypt, of, the, panth, on, in, paris
