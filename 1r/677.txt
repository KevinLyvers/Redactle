worked, at, a, lumber, and, coal, business, before, joining, t, mellon, sons, as, a, full, time, employee, in, 1873, that, same, year, the, panic, of, 1873, devastated, the, local, and, national, economy, wiping, out, a, portion, of, the, mellon, fortune, with, andrew, taking, a, leading, role, at, t, mellon, sons, the, bank, quickly, recovered, and, by, late, 1874, the, bank, s, deposits, had, reached, the, level, they, had, been, at, before, the, onset, of, the, panic, mellon, s, role, at, t, mellon, sons, continued, to, grow, after, 1873, and, in, 1876, he, was, given, power, of, attorney, to, direct, the, operations, of, the, bank, that, same, year, thomas, introduced, his, son, to, henry, clay, frick, a, customer, of, the, bank, who, would, become, one, of, mellons, s,

assets, to, andrew, despite, the, large, sums, entrusted, to, andrew, the, businesses, he, ran, were, still, fairly, small, in, the, 1890s, t, mellon, sons, employed, seven, individuals, in, 1895, in,

became, a, director, of, the, company, in, 1891, and, he, and, richard, played, a, major, role, in, the, establishment, of, aluminum, factories, in, new, kensington, pennsylvania, and, niagara, falls, new, york, the, company, would, emerge, as, one, of, the, most, profitable, ventures, invested, in, by, the, mellons, and, in, 1907, it, was, renamed, alcoa, moving, into, the, petroleum, industry, the, mellon, family, also, established, the, crescent, oil, company, the, crescent, pipeline, company, and, the, bear, creek, refinery, by, 1894, the, mellon, family, s, vertically, integrated, companies, produced, ten, percent, of, the, oil, exported, by, the, united, states, partly, due, to, the, difficult, economic, conditions, caused, by, the, onset, of, the, panic, of, 1893, in, 1895, the, mellons, sold, their, oil, interests, to, standard, oil, at, roughly, the, same, time, they, were, selling, their, oil, concerns, andrew, and, richard, invested, in, the, carborundum, company, a,

causing, the, johnstown, flood, which, killed, 2, 000, people, and, destroyed, 1, 600, homes, in, the, aftermath, of, the, flood, knox, led, a, legal, defense, that, successfully, argued, that, the, club, bore, no, legal, responsibility, for, the, flood, mellon, did, not, publicly, comment, on, the, flood, though, he, did, donate, 1, 000, to, a, relief, fund, by, the, late, 1890s, mellon, had, amassed, a, substantial, fortune, but, his, wealth, paled, in, comparison, to, that, of, better, known, business, leaders, such, as, john, d, rockefeller, in, the, late, 1890s, the, union, trust, company, emerged, for, the, first, time, as, one, of, mellon, s, most, important, and, profitable, holdings, after, mellon, broadened, the, company, s, activities, to, include, commercial, banking, with, an, infusion, of, capital, from, union, trust, mellon, underwrote, the, capitalization, of, national, glass, and, several, other, companies, he, also, became, a, co, owner, of, the, mcclintic,

the, production, of, nails, and, barbed, wire, though, frick, had, fallen, out, with, steel, magnate, and, long, time, business, partner, andrew, carnegie, mellon, received, carnegie, s, consent, to, venture, into, the, steel, industry, responding, to, the, growing, emphasis, on, naval, power, in, the, aftermath, of, the, spanish, american, war, mellon, and, frick, also, became, major, shareholders, in, the, new, york, shipbuilding, corporation, in, 1902, mellon, reorganized, t, mellon, sons, as, the, mellon, national, bank, a, federally, chartered, national, bank, andrew, mellon, richard, mellon, and, frick, drew, up, a, new, business, arrangement, in, which, the, three, of, them, jointly, controlled, the, union, trust, company, which, in, turn, controlled, mellon, national, bank, they, also, established, union, savings, bank, which, accepted, deposits, by, mail, and, the, mellon, banks, flourished, in, the, first, years, of, the, 20th, century, while, mellon, s, financial, empire, prospered, his, investments, in, other, areas, including, pittsburgh, s, streetcar, network, the, union, steel, company, which, was, bought, out, by, u, s, steel, and, the, carborundum, company, also, paid, off, handsomely, another, successful, mellon, investment, the, standard, steel, car, company, was, created, in, partnership, with, three, former, u, s, steel, executives, as, part, of, the, texas, oil, boom, the, mellons, also, helped, j, m, guffey, establish, the, guffey, company, the, mellons, later, removed, guffey, as, the, head, of, his, company, and, in, 1907, they, reorganized, the, guffey, company, as, gulf, oil, and, installed, william, larimer, mellon, sr, a, son, of, andrew, mellon, s, older, brother, james, ross, mellon, as, the, head, of, gulf, oil, the, success, of, mellon, s, financial, empire, and, his, varied, investments, made, him, according, to, biographer, david, cannadine, the, single, most, significant, individual, in, the, economic, life, and, progress, of, western, pennsylvania, in, the, first, decade, of, the, 20th, century, the, panic, of, 1907, devastated, several, companies, based, in, pittsburgh, ending, a, period, of, strong, growth, some, of, mellon, s, investments, experienced, a, sustained, down, period, after, 1907, but, most, experienced, a, quick, recovery, mellon, also, became, an, investor, in, george, westinghouse, s, westinghouse, electric, corporation, after, he, helped, prevent, the, company, from, going, into, bankruptcy, by, the, end, of, 1913, mellon, national, bank, held, more, money, in, deposits, than, any, other, bank, in, pittsburgh, and, the, farmer, s, deposit, national, bank, which, held, the, second, largest, amount, of, deposits, was, controlled, by, mellon, s, union, trust, company, in, 1914, mellon, became, a, co, owner, of, koppers, which, produced, a, more, sophisticated, coking, oven, than, the, one, that, had, earlier, been, pioneered, by, frick, he, also, served, as, a, director, of, various, other, companies, including, the, pennsylvania, railroad, and, the, american, locomotive, company, mellon, was, deeply, involved, in, the, financing, of, world, war, i, as, the, union, trust, company, and, other, mellon, institutions, provided, millions, of, dollars, in, loans, to, the, united, kingdom, and, france, and, mellon, himself, invested, in, liberty, bonds, in, 1887, frick, andrew, and, richard, mellon, jointly, purchased, old, overholt, a, whiskey, distillery, located, in, west, overton, pennsylvania, at, the, time, old, overholt, was, one, of, the, largest, and, most, respected, whiskey, producers, in, the, country, in, 1907, as, prohibition, became, more, popular, across, the, country, frick, and, mellon, removed, their, names, from, the, distilling, license, but, retained, ownership, in, the, company, it, is, believed, that, mellon, s, connections, in, the, treasury, department, are, what, allowed, the, company, to, secure, a, medicinal, permit, during, prohibition, this, permit, allowed, overholt, to, sell, existing, whiskey, stocks, to, druggists, for, medicinal, use, when, frick, died, in, december, 1919, he, left, his, share, to, mellon, in, 1925, under, pressure, from, prohibitionists, mellon, sold, his, share, of, the, company, to, a, new, york, grocer, like, his, father, mellon, consistently, supported, the, republican, party, and, he, frequently, donated, to, state, and, local, party, leaders, through, state, party, boss, matthew, quay, mellon, influenced, legislators, to, place, high, tariffs, on, aluminum, products, in, the, mckinley, tariff, of, 1890, during, the, early, 20th, century, mellon, was, dismayed, by, the, rise, of, progressivism, and, the, antitrust, actions, pursued, by, the, presidential, administrations, of, theodore, roosevelt, william, howard, taft, and, woodrow, wilson, he, especially, opposed, the, taft, administration, s, investigations, into, alcoa, which, in, 1912, signed, a, consent, decree, rather, than, going, to, trial, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, he, provided, financial, support, to, henry, cabot, lodge, and, other, republicans, in, their, successful, campaign, to, prevent, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, mellon, attended, the, 1920, republican, national, convention, as, a, nominal, supporter, of, pennsylvania, governor, william, cameron, sproul, mellon, hoped, senator, philander, knox, would, win, the, nomination, but, the, convention, chose, senator, warren, g, harding, of, ohio, as, the, party, s, presidential, nominee, mellon, strongly, approved, of, the, party, s, conservative, platform, and, he, served, as, a, key, fundraiser, for, harding, during, the, presidential, campaign, following, harding, s, victory, in, the, 1920, presidential, election, harding, considered, various, candidates, for, secretary, of, the, treasury, including, frank, lowden, john, w, weeks, charles, dawes, and, at, the, urging, of, senator, knox, andrew, mellon, by, 1920, mellon, was, little, known, outside, of, banking, circles, but, his, potential, appointment, to, the, cabinet, received, strong, support, from, bankers, and, pennsylvania, republican, leaders, like, knox, senator, boies, penrose, and, governor, sproul, mellon, was, reluctant, to, enter, public, life, due, to, concerns, about, privacy, and, a, belief, that, his, ownership, of, various, businesses, including, old, overholt, distillery, would, be, a, political, liability, but, mellon, also, wanted, to, retire, from, active, participation, in, business, and, he, saw, a, cabinet, position, as, a, prestigious, capstone, to, his, career, mellon, agreed, to, accept, appointment, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, in, february, 1921, and, his, nomination, was, quickly, confirmed, by, the, united, states, senate, though, mellon, s, supporters, believed, that, he, was, highly, qualified, to, address, the, economic, issues, facing, the, country, critics, of, the, harding, administration, saw, the, mellon, appointment, as, a, sign, that, harding, would, reseat, the, power, of, special, privileged, interests, the, powers, of, avarice, and, greed, the, powers, that, seek, self, aggrandizement, at, the, expense, of, the, general, public, harding, paired, the, nomination, of, mellon, with, that, of, secretary, of, commerce, herbert, hoover, who, was, distrusted, by, many, of, the, same, senate, republicans, who, favored, mellon, s, candidacy, before, joining, the, cabinet, mellon, sold, his, banking, stock, to, his, brother, richard, but, he, continued, to, hold, his, non, banking, stock, through, richard, and, other, business, associates, mellon, continued, to, be, involved, with, the, major, decisions, of, the, mellon, business, empire, during, his, time, in, public, service, and, he, occasionally, lobbied, congressmen, on, behalf, of, his, businesses, his, fortune, continued, to, grow, and, at, one, point, in, the, 1920s, he, paid, more, in, federal, income, tax, than, any, other, individual, save, john, rockefeller, and, henry, ford, as, treasury, secretary, mellon, focused, on, balancing, the, budget, and, paying, off, world, war, i, debts, in, the, midst, of, the, depression, of, 1920, 21, he, was, largely, unconcerned, with, international, affairs, and, economic, matters, such, as, the, unemployment, rate, to, mellon, s, chagrin, his, department, was, charged, with, enforcing, prohibition, he, did, not, believe, in, teetotaling, himself, and, viewed, the, law, as, unenforceable, aside, from, balancing, the, budget, mellon, s, top, priority, was, an, overhaul, of, the, federal, tax, code, the, income, tax, had, become, a, major, part, of, the, federal, government, s, revenue, system, with, the, passage, of, the, revenue, act, of, 1913, and, federal, taxation, on, income, had, increased, during, world, war, i, to, provide, funding, for, the, war, effort, according, to, m, susan, murnane, major, reforms, to, the, federal, income, tax, in, the, aftermath, of, world, war, i, were, inevitable, but, the, exact, nature, of, the, tax, system, in, the, 1920s, was, debated, by, conservatives, and, progressives, within, the, republican, party, unlike, the, progressives, in, his, party, mellon, rejected, the, redistributive, nature, of, the, taxation, system, that, had, been, left, in, place, by, the, wilson, administration, owing, in, part, to, the, high, debts, left, over, from, the, war, mellon, did, not, join, with, some, conservatives, in, the, party, who, favored, the, virtual, abolition, of, the, income, tax, in, favor, of, high, tariff, rates, excise, taxes, a, national, sales, tax, or, some, combination, thereof, mellon, instead, advocated, the, retention, of, a, progressive, income, tax, that, would, serve, as, an, important, but, not, primary, source, of, revenue, for, the, federal, government, his, so, called, scientific, taxation, was, designed, to, maximize, federal, revenue, while, minimizing, the, impact, on, business, and, industry, the, central, tenet, of, mellon, s, tax, plan, was, a, reduction, of, the, surtax, a, progressive, tax, that, affected, only, high, income, earners, mellon, argued, that, such, a, reduction, would, minimize, tax, avoidance, and, would, not, affect, federal, revenue, because, it, would, lead, to, greater, economic, growth, he, hoped, that, tax, reform, would, encourage, high, earners, to, move, their, savings, from, tax, exempt, state, and, municipal, bonds, to, taxable, higher, yield, industrial, stocks, though, much, of, the, tax, plan, that, he, proposed, had, been, developed, by, former, wilson, administration, officials, russell, cornell, leffingwell, and, seymour, parker, gilbert, the, press, generally, referred, to, it, as, the, mellon, plan, the, revenue, act, of, 1918, had, set, a, top, marginal, income, tax, rate, of, 73, and, a, corporate, tax, of, approximately, 10, due, in, part, to, the, size, of, the, u, s, public, debt, which, had, grown, from, 1, billion, before, the, war, to, 24, billion, in, 1921, the, provisions, of, the, revenue, act, of, 1918, remained, in, place, when, harding, took, office, in, 1921, the, treasury, department, and, the, house, ways, and, means, committee, jointly, prepared, a, bill, setting, the, top, marginal, rate, at, the, level, advocated, by, mellon, but, opposition, in, the, senate, from, progressives, like, senator, robert, m, la, follette, limited, the, size, of, the, tax, cuts, in, november, 1921, congress, passed, and, harding, signed, the, revenue, act, of, 1921, which, raised, personal, tax, exemptions, and, lowered, the, top, marginal, tax, rate, to, 58, because, it, differed, from, his, original, proposals, mellon, was, displeased, by, the, bill, he, also, strongly, disapproved, of, a, bonus, bill, passed, by, congress, that, would, provide, for, additional, compensation, to, veterans, of, world, war, i, partly, because, he, feared, it, would, interfere, with, his, plans, to, reduce, debt, and, taxes, with, mellon, s, support, harding, vetoed, the, bill, and, congress, failed, to, override, the, veto, as, the, economy, recovered, from, recession, and, began, to, experience, the, prosperity, of, the, roaring, twenties, mellon, emerged, as, one, of, the, most, renowned, figures, in, the, harding, administration, one, admiring, congressman, referred, to, mellon, as, the, greatest, secretary, of, the, treasury, since, alexander, hamilton, harding, died, after, suffering, a, stroke, in, august, 1923, and, he, was, succeeded, by, vice, president, calvin, coolidge, mellon, enjoyed, closer, relations, with, president, coolidge, than, he, had, with, president, harding, and, coolidge, and, mellon, shared, similar, views, on, most, major, issues, including, the, necessity, for, further, tax, cuts, william, allen, white, a, contemporary, journalist, stated, that, so, completely, did, andrew, mellon, dominate, the, white, house, in, the, days, when, the, coolidge, administration, was, at, its, zenith, that, it, would, be, fair, to, call, the, administration, the, reign, of, coolidge, and, mellon, coolidge, mellon, business, organizations, and, administration, allies, conducted, a, publicity, campaign, designed, to, convince, wavering, congressmen, to, support, mellon, s, tax, plan, their, efforts, were, opposed, by, the, coalition, of, democrats, and, progressive, republicans, that, exercised, effective, control, over, the, 68th, congress, in, february, 1924, the, house, ways, and, means, committee, approved, of, a, bill, based, on, mellon, s, plan, but, an, alliance, of, progressive, republicans, and, democrats, engineered, passage, of, an, alternative, tax, bill, written, by, democrat, john, nance, garner, garner, s, plan, also, reduced, income, taxes, but, set, the, top, marginal, tax, rate, at, 46, rather, than, mellon, s, preferred, 33, in, june, 1924, coolidge, signed, the, revenue, act, of, 1924, which, contained, the, income, tax, rates, of, garner, s, bill, and, also, increased, the, estate, tax, coolidge, signed, the, bill, but, simultaneously, called, for, further, tax, cuts, congress, also, rejected, mellon, s, proposed, constitutional, amendment, that, would, have, barred, the, issuance, of, tax, exempt, securities, and, over, coolidge, s, veto, authorized, a, bonus, to, world, war, i, veterans, mellon, did, however, win, one, legislative, victory, as, he, convinced, congress, to, create, the, board, of, tax, appeals, to, adjudicate, disputes, between, taxpayers, and, the, government, mellon, had, originally, planned, to, retire, after, one, presidential, term, but, decided, to, remain, in, the, cabinet, in, the, hope, of, presiding, over, the, full, enactment, of, his, taxation, proposals, in, the, 1924, presidential, election, the, republicans, campaigned, on, further, tax, cuts, while, both, the, democrats, and, third, party, candidate, robert, la, follette, denounced, mellon, s, tax, proposals, as, a, device, to, relieve, multi, millionaires, at, the, expense, of, other, taxpayers, buoyed, by, the, strong, economy, and, overcoming, the, scandals, of, the, harding, years, coolidge, won, re, election, by, a, decisive, margin, coolidge, saw, his, victory, as, a, mandate, to, pursue, his, favored, economic, policies, including, further, tax, cuts, when, congress, reconvened, after, the, 1924, elections, it, immediately, began, working, on, another, bill, designed, to, lower, tax, rates, on, the, highest, earners, in, february, 1926, coolidge, signed, the, revenue, act, of, 1926, which, reduced, the, top, marginal, rate, to, 25, mellon, was, extremely, pleased, by, the, passage, of, the, act, because, unlike, the, revenue, act, of, 1921, and, the, revenue, act, of, 1924, the, revenue, act, of, 1926, closely, reflected, mellon, s, proposals, in, addition, to, cutting, tax, rates, on, top, earners, the, act, also, raised, the, personal, exemption, for, federal, income, taxes, abolished, the, gift, tax, reduced, the, estate, tax, rate, and, repealed, a, provision, that, had, required, the, public, disclosure, of, federal, income, tax, returns, meanwhile, the, booming, economy, fostered, a, 400, million, budget, surplus, in, 1926, and, the, country, s, national, debt, dropped, from, 24, billion, in, early, 1921, to, 19, 6, billion, at, the, end, of, fiscal, year, 1926, government, revenues, increased, considerably, under, mellon, s, plan, largely, collected, from, higher, income, earners, with, his, top, priority, of, tax, reform, accomplished, mellon, increasingly, turned, over, management, of, the, treasury, department, to, his, deputy, ogden, l, mills, after, the, 1926, elections, mellon, and, mills, sought, to, cut, the, corporate, tax, and, fully, repeal, the, estate, tax, the, revenue, act, of, 1928, did, indeed, cut, the, corporate, tax, but, the, estate, tax, was, left, unchanged, mellon, also, focused, on, the, construction, of, new, federal, buildings, and, his, efforts, led, to, the, construction, of, several, buildings, in, the, federal, triangle, in, 1928, mellon, stated, that, in, no, other, nation, and, at, no, other, time, in, the, history, of, the, world, have, so, many, people, enjoyed, such, a, high, degree, of, prosperity, or, maintained, a, standard, of, living, comparable, to, that, which, prevails, throughout, this, country, today, responsibility, for, foreign, relations, lay, with, the, state, department, rather, than, the, treasury, department, and, benjamin, strong, jr, and, other, central, bankers, took, the, lead, with, regard, to, international, monetary, policy, but, mellon, nonetheless, exercised, some, influence, in, foreign, affairs, he, strongly, opposed, the, cancellation, of, european, debts, from, world, war, i, but, recognized, that, britain, and, other, countries, would, be, unable, to, pay, those, debts, without, a, renegotiation, of, terms, in, 1923, mellon, and, british, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, stanley, baldwin, negotiated, an, agreement, in, which, britain, promised, to, pay, off, the, debts, over, a, 62, year, period, after, the, adoption, of, the, dawes, plan, mellon, reached, debt, settlements, with, several, other, european, countries, after, protracted, negotiations, the, united, states, and, france, agreed, to, the, mellon, berenger, agreement, which, reduced, france, s, debt, and, set, terms, for, repayment, coolidge, surprised, many, observers, by, announcing, that, he, would, not, seek, another, term, in, august, 1927, the, decision, left, hoover, as, the, presumed, front, runner, for, the, 1928, presidential, election, but, many, conservatives, within, the, party, opposed, hoover, s, candidacy, the, conservative, resistance, to, hoover, centered, around, mellon, who, controlled, pennsylvania, s, delegation, at, the, 1928, republican, national, convention, and, was, influential, with, republicans, throughout, the, country, though, they, had, maintained, an, amicable, relationship, in, public, mellon, privately, distrusted, hoover, resented, hoover, s, engagement, in, the, affairs, of, other, cabinet, departments, and, feared, that, a, president, hoover, would, move, away, from, mellon, s, tax, policies, several, republicans, urged, mellon, to, run, for, president, but, mellon, believed, that, he, was, too, old, to, seek, the, presidency, mellon, attempted, to, convince, coolidge, or, charles, evans, hughes, to, run, but, neither, heeded, his, appeals, in, the, months, before, the, 1928, republican, convention, mellon, maintained, his, neutrality, in, the, presidential, race, but, with, no, compelling, alternative, republican, candidate, willing, to, run, mellon, finally, threw, his, support, behind, hoover, with, mellon, s, backing, hoover, won, the, republican, nomination, on, the, first, ballot, of, the, convention, and, he, went, on, to, defeat, al, smith, in, the, 1928, presidential, election, defying, widespread, expectations, that, he, would, retire, mellon, chose, to, stay, on, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, along, with, secretary, of, agriculture, james, wilson, and, secretary, of, labor, james, j, davis, mellon, is, one, of, only, three, cabinet, members, to, serve, in, the, same, post, under, three, consecutive, presidents, secretary, mellon, had, helped, persuade, the, federal, reserve, board, to, lower, interest, rates, in, 1921, and, 1924, lower, interest, rates, contributed, to, a, booming, economy, but, they, also, encouraged, stock, market, speculation, in, 1928, responding, to, increasing, fears, of, the, dangers, of, speculation, and, a, booming, stock, market, the, federal, reserve, board, began, raising, interest, rates, mellon, favored, another, interest, rate, increase, in, 1929, and, in, august, 1929, the, federal, reserve, board, raised, the, discount, rate, to, six, percent, the, higher, rate, failed, to, curb, speculation, and, the, activity, on, the, stock, market, continued, to, grow, in, october, 1929, the, new, york, stock, exchange, suffered, the, worst, crash, in, its, history, in, what, was, called, black, tuesday, as, the, vast, majority, of, americans, did, not, own, shares, in, the, stock, market, the, crash, did, not, immediately, have, disastrous, effects, on, the, u, s, economy, as, a, whole, mellon, had, little, sympathy, for, the, speculators, who, lost, their, money, and, he, was, philosophically, opposed, to, an, interventionist, economic, policy, designed, to, address, the, stock, market, crash, nonetheless, mellon, immediately, began, calling, for, cuts, to, the, discount, rate, which, would, reach, two, percent, in, mid, 1930, and, successfully, urged, congress, to, pass, a, bill, providing, for, temporary, across, the, board, tax, cuts, mellon, supported, the, idea, of, asset, liquidation, to, balance, budgets, even, if, it, meant, shutting, down, entire, industries, by, mid, 1930, many, including, mellon, believed, that, the, economy, had, already, experienced, the, worst, effects, of, the, stock, market, crash, he, did, not, object, to, the, smoot, hawley, tariff, act, which, raised, tariff, rates, to, one, of, the, highest, levels, in, u, s, history, despite, the, optimism, of, hoover, and, mellon, in, late, 1930, the, economy, went, into, a, deep, slump, as, gross, national, product, declined, dramatically, and, numerous, workers, lost, their, jobs, while, numerous, banks, failed, democrats, won, control, of, congress, in, the, 1930, mid, term, elections, as, the, economy, declined, so, did, mellon, s, popularity, which, was, further, damaged, by, his, opposition, to, another, bonus, bill, for, veterans, in, mid, 1931, the, country, entered, a, deep, depression, and, at, hoover, s, request, mellon, negotiated, a, moratorium, on, german, debt, repayments, after, mellon, returned, to, the, united, states, in, august, 1931, he, was, confronted, by, another, series, of, bank, failures, among, the, banks, that, failed, was, the, bank, of, pittsburgh, the, lone, remaining, major, pittsburgh, bank, not, controlled, by, the, mellon, family, again, following, hoover, s, lead, mellon, presided, over, the, creation, of, the, national, credit, association, a, voluntary, initiative, among, the, larger, banks, that, was, designed, to, assist, failing, institutions, as, the, national, credit, association, proved, to, be, ineffective, at, stemming, the, tide, of, bank, failures, congress, and, the, hoover, administration, established, the, reconstruction, finance, corporation, to, provide, federal, loans, to, banks, with, the, unemployment, rate, approaching, twenty, percent, mellon, became, one, of, the, most, loathed, leaders, in, the, united, states, second, only, to, hoover, himself, facing, this, unprecedented, economic, catastrophe, mellon, urged, hoover, to, refrain, from, using, the, government, to, intervene, in, the, depression, mellon, believed, that, economic, recessions, such, as, those, that, had, occurred, in, 1873, and, 1907, were, a, necessary, part, of, the, business, cycle, because, they, purged, the, economy, in, his, memoirs, hoover, wrote, that, mellon, advised, him, to, liquidate, labor, liquidate, stocks, liquidate, the, farmers, liquidate, real, estate, purge, the, rottenness, out, of, the, system, high, costs, of, living, and, high, living, will, come, down, enterprising, people, will, pick, up, the, wrecks, from, less, competent, people, facing, a, large, deficit, mellon, and, mills, called, for, a, return, to, the, tax, rates, set, by, the, revenue, act, of, 1924, and, also, sought, new, taxes, on, automobiles, gasoline, and, other, items, congress, responded, by, passing, the, revenue, act, of, 1932, which, included, many, of, the, treasury, department, s, proposals, in, early, 1932, congressman, wright, patman, of, texas, initiated, impeachment, proceedings, against, mellon, contending, that, mellon, had, violated, numerous, federal, laws, designed, to, prevent, conflicts, of, interest, though, mellon, had, defeated, similar, investigations, in, the, past, his, falling, popularity, left, him, unable, to, effectively, counter, patman, s, charges, hoover, removed, mellon, from, washington, by, offering, him, the, position, of, ambassador, to, the, united, kingdom, mellon, accepted, the, post, and, mills, replaced, his, former, boss, as, secretary, of, the, treasury, mellon, arrived, in, britain, in, april, 1932, receiving, a, friendly, reception, from, a, country, he, had, often, visited, over, the, previous, thirty, years, from, his, post, he, watched, the, collapse, of, the, international, economic, order, including, the, debt, accords, that, he, had, helped, negotiate, he, also, convinced, the, british, to, allow, gulf, oil, to, operate, in, kuwait, a, british, protectorate, in, the, oil, rich, region, of, the, persian, gulf, defying, mellon, s, expectations, hoover, was, defeated, by, franklin, d, roosevelt, in, the, 1932, presidential, election, mellon, left, office, when, hoover, s, term, ended, in, march, 1933, returning, to, private, life, after, twelve, years, of, government, service, knox, and, penrose, both, died, in, 1921, leaving, a, power, vacuum, in, pennsylvania, republican, politics, along, with, his, nephew, william, larimer, mellon, mellon, became, an, influential, player, in, pennsylvania, politics, and, their, support, helped, ensure, the, elections, of, senator, david, a, reed, and, senator, george, w, pepper, in, 1922, mellon, was, unable, to, assert, the, same, level, of, control, that, boies, penrose, had, had, over, state, politics, and, his, leadership, of, the, state, party, was, challenged, by, william, scott, vare, of, philadelphia, and, progressive, leader, gifford, pinchot, who, won, the, 1922, pennsylvania, gubernatorial, election, nonetheless, mellon, would, continue, to, exert, an, important, influence, on, pennsylvania, politics, throughout, the, 1920s, especially, in, senatorial, elections, and, in, allegheny, county, mellon, s, influence, over, state, politics, waned, in, the, early, 1930s, as, the, progressive, allies, of, governor, pinchot, took, control, of, the, state, republican, party, numerous, financial, institutions, failed, in, the, months, prior, to, roosevelt, s, inauguration, but, mellon, national, bank, the, union, trust, company, and, another, mellon, banking, operation, mellbank, corporation, were, all, able, to, avoid, closure, mellon, strongly, opposed, roosevelt, s, new, deal, policies, especially, the, 1933, banking, act, which, required, separation, between, commercial, and, investment, banking, mellon, believed, that, the, various, new, deal, policies, including, social, security, and, unemployment, insurance, undermined, the, free, market, system, that, had, produced, one, of, the, largest, economies, in, the, world, aside, from, banking, reform, other, new, deal, policies, including, regulations, on, utilities, and, coal, mines, and, laws, designed, to, promote, labor, unions, also, affected, mellon, s, business, empire, additionally, the, revenue, act, of, 1934, and, the, revenue, act, of, 1935, rescinded, many, of, mellon, s, tax, policies, and, contained, other, provisions, that, were, designed, to, increase, taxation, on, top, earners, and, corporations, even, after, leaving, office, mellon, continued, to, be, vilified, by, many, in, the, public, and, in, 1933, harvey, o, connor, published, a, popular, and, unfavorable, biography, mellon, s, millions, democrats, won, effective, control, of, allegheny, county, in, the, 1933, elections, and, the, following, year, democrat, joseph, f, guffey, won, pennsylvania, s, senate, election, and, george, howard, earle, iii, won, the, state, s, gubernatorial, election, mellon, endured, numerous, attacks, during, these, campaigns, and, his, unpopularity, in, pittsburgh, led, him, to, spend, most, of, his, final, years, in, washington, rather, than, his, home, town, in, the, 1930s, the, roosevelt, administration, conducted, several, high, profile, tax, evasion, prosecutions, against, individuals, such, as, thomas, w, lamont, and, jimmy, walker, in, response, to, accusations, levied, by, republican, congressman, louis, thomas, mcfadden, of, pennsylvania, in, early, 1933, attorney, general, homer, cummings, began, an, inquiry, into, mellon, s, tax, history, between, february, 1935, and, may, 1936, the, board, of, tax, appeals, heard, a, widely, covered, case, in, which, the, federal, government, accused, mellon, of, tax, fraud, during, the, proceedings, mellon, divulged, numerous, details, of, his, business, career, that, had, previously, been, unknown, to, the, public, mellon, was, diagnosed, with, cancer, in, november, 1936, his, health, declined, in, 1937, and, he, died, on, august, 26, 1937, newspapers, across, the, country, took, note, of, his, death, secretary, of, the, treasury, henry, morgenthau, jr, stated, that, mellon, had, lived, through, an, epoch, in, the, economic, history, of, the, nation, and, his, passing, takes, one, of, the, most, important, industrial, and, financial, figures, of, our, time, months, after, mellon, s, death, the, board, of, tax, appeals, handed, down, a, ruling, exonerating, mellon, of, all, tax, fraud, charges, in, the, early, 1880s, mellon, had, a, serious, relationship, with, fannie, larimer, jones, but, he, broke, off, the, relationship, after, learning, that, she, was, suffering, from, tuberculosis, after, this, experience, mellon, refrained, from, courting, women, for, several, years, in, 1898, while, traveling, with, frick, and, frick, s, wife, to, europe, mellon, met, nora, mcmullen, a, nineteen, year, old, englishwoman, of, ulster, scots, ancestry, mellon, visited, mcmullen, s, home, of, hertford, castle, in, 1898, and, 1899, and, after, a, period, of, courtship, the, couple, married, in, 1900, nora, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, ailsa, in, 1901, nora, disliked, living, in, pittsburgh, and, she, was, unhappy, in, her, marriage, by, the, end, of, 1903, she, had, begun, an, affair, with, alfred, george, curphey, who, would, also, later, be, involved, with, the, wife, of, george, vivian, 4th, baron, vivian, mellon, and, nora, eventually, reconciled, and, in, 1907, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, paul, the, reconciliation, proved, short, lived, as, nora, took, up, with, curphey, again, in, 1908, and, requested, a, divorce, the, following, year, to, avoid, a, public, scandal, andrew, reluctantly, agreed, to, a, separation, in, 1909, seeking, to, hold, divorce, proceedings, privately, before, a, judge, rather, than, publicly, before, a, jury, in, 1911, mellon, convinced, the, pennsylvania, legislature, to, amend, a, law, that, had, required, a, jury, trial, in, divorce, proceedings, in, response, nora, attacked, mellon, in, the, press, and, the, divorce, proceedings, were, widely, covered, by, the, media, in, 1912, mellon, and, nora, finally, agreed, on, a, divorce, settlement, largely, on, mellon, s, terms, mellon, did, not, remarry, nora,
