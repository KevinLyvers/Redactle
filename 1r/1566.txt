schools, that, specialized, in, religious, studies, only, and, sought, to, demonstrate, that, local, schools, that, held, regular, academic, classes, as, well, as, classes, in, religion, were, more, beneficial, to, their, pupils, than, religious, schools, with, lopsided, curricula, at, this, time, qutb, developed, his, bent, against, the, imams, and, their, traditional, approach, to, education,

criticism, of, western, civilization, as, instead, of, liberating, man, as, the, post, enlightenment, narrative, claimed, he, believed, that, western, modernity, enmeshed, people, in, spiritually, numbing, networks, of, control, and, discipline, and, that, rather, than, building, caring, communities, it, cultivated, attitudes, of, selfish, individualism, qutb, regarded, carrel, as, a, rare, sort, of, western, thinker, one, who, understood, that, his, civilization, depreciated, humanity, by, honouring, the, machine, over, the, spirit, and, soul, al, nafs, wa, al, ruh, he, saw, carrel, s,

never, able, to, find, a, woman, of, sufficient, moral, purity, and, discretion, and, had, to, reconcile, himself, to, bachelorhood, it, was, clear, from, his, childhood, that, qutb, valued, education, playing, the, part, of, a, teacher, to, the, women, in, his, village, syed, qutb, from, a, young, age, would, save, up, his, money, for, a, man, called, amsaalih, who, used, to, sell, books, around, the, local, villages, he, would, have, a, big, collection, of, books, and, another, small, collection, specifically, for, syed, qutb, if, syed, never, had, the, money, he, would, tell, him, that, i, don, t, have, the, money, now, so, let, me, borrow, it, and, i, ll, give, it, you, next, time, you, come, around, and, amsaalih, would, let, him, do, that, at, the, age, of, 12, he, had, his, own, library, collection, of, 25, books, even, though, books, were, really, expensive, during, that, time, he, would, imitate, the, scholars, by, reading, the, books, and, then, give, lectures, to, the, rest, of, the, village, if, any, women, needed, any, information, they, would, wait, till, syed, qutb, came, back, from, school, and, ask, him, to, share, the, knowledge, he, had, to, them, in, many, occasions, he, would, be, shy, because, he, was, a, young, man, but, in, some, occasions, he, would, go, and, teach, the, knowledge, he, had, to, the, people, who, asked, him, time, in, the, united, states, pursuing, further, studies, in, educational, administration, cemented, some, of, qutb, s, views, over, two, years, he, worked, and, studied, at, wilson, teachers, college, in,

even, though, more, and, more, conservative, he, still, was, western, in, so, many, ways, his, dress, his, love, of, classical, music, and, hollywood, movies, he, had, read, in, translation, the, works, of, charles, darwin, and, albert, einstein, lord, byron, and, percy, bysshe, shelley, and, had, immersed, himself, in, french, literature, especially, victor, hugo, on, his, return, to, egypt, qutb, in, 1951, published, the, america, that, i, have, seen, where, he, became, explicitly, critical, of, things, he, had, observed, in, the, united, states, eventually, encapsulating, the, west, more, generally, its, materialism, individual, freedoms, economic, system, poor, haircuts, superficiality, in, conversations, and, friendships, restrictions, on, divorce, enthusiasm, for, sports, lack, of, artistic, feeling, animal, like, mixing, of, the, genders, which, went, on, even, in, churches, and, strong, support, for, the, new, israeli, state, hisham, sabrin, noted, that, as, a, brown, person, in, greeley, colorado, in, the, late, 1940s, studying, english, he, came, across, much, prejudice, he, was, appalled, by, what, he, perceived, as, loose, sexual, openness, of, american, men, and, women, a, far, cry, from, his, home, of, musha, asyut, this, american, experience, was, for, him, a, fine, tuning, of, his, islamic, identity, he, himself, tells, us, on, his, boat, trip, over, should, i, travel, to, america, and, become, flimsy, and, ordinary, like, those, who, are, satisfied, with, idle, talk, and, sleep, or, should, i, distinguish, myself, with, values, and, spirit, is, there, other, than, islam, that, i, should, be, steadfast, to, in, its, character, and, hold, on, to, its, instructions, in, this, life, amidst, deviant, chaos, and, the, endless, means, of, satisfying, animalistic, desires, pleasures, and, awful, sins, i, wanted, to, be, the, latter, man, qutb, noted, with, disapproval, the, openly, displayed, sexuality, of, american, women, the, american, girl, is, well, acquainted, with, her, body, s, seductive, capacity, she, knows, it, lies, in, the, face, and, in, expressive, eyes, and, thirsty, lips, she, knows, seductiveness, lies, in, the, round, breasts, the, full, buttocks, and, in, the, shapely, thighs, sleek, legs, and, she, shows, all, this, and, does, not, hide, it, he, also, commented, on, the, american, taste, in, arts, the, american, is, primitive, in, his, artistic, taste, both, in, what, he, enjoys, as, art, and, in, his, own, artistic, works, jazz, music, is, his, music, of, choice, this, is, that, music, that, the, negroes, invented, to, satisfy, their, primitive, inclinations, as, well, as, their, desire, to, be, noisy, on, the, one, hand, and, to, excite, bestial, tendencies, on, the, other, the, american, s, intoxication, in, jazz, music, does, not, reach, its, full, completion, until, the, music, is, accompanied, by, singing, that, is, just, as, coarse, and, obnoxious, as, the, music, itself, meanwhile, the, noise, of, the, instruments, and, the, voices, mounts, and, it, rings, in, the, ears, to, an, unbearable, degree, the, agitation, of, the, multitude, increases, and, the, voices, of, approval, mount, and, their, palms, ring, out, in, vehement, continuous, applause, that, all, but, deafens, the, ears, qutb, concluded, that, major, aspects, of, american, life, were, primitive, and, shocking, he, saw, americans, as, numb, to, faith, in, religion, faith, in, art, and, faith, in, spiritual, values, altogether, his, experience, in, the, united, states, formed, in, part, the, impetus, for, his, rejection, of, western, values, and, his, move, towards, islamism, upon, returning, to, egypt, resigning, from, the, civil, service, he, joined, the, muslim, brotherhood, in, the, early, 1950s, and, became, editor, in, chief, of, the, brothers, weekly, al, ikhwan, al, muslimin, and, later, head, of, its, propaganda, section, as, well, as, an, appointed, member, of, the, working, committee, and, of, its, guidance, council, the, highest, branch, in, the, organization, in, july, 1952, egypt, s, pro, western, government, was, overthrown, by, the, nationalist, free, officers, movement, headed, by, gamal, abdel, nasser, both, qutb, and, the, muslim, brotherhood, welcomed, the, coup, d, tat, against, the, monarchist, government, which, they, saw, as, un, islamic, and, subservient, to, the, british, empire, and, enjoyed, a, close, relationship, with, the, movement, prior, to, and, immediately, following, the, coup, nasser, would, go, to, the, house, of, syed, qutb, and, ask, him, for, ideas, about, the, revolution, many, members, of, the, brotherhood, expected, nasser, to, establish, an, islamic, government, however, the, co, operation, between, the, brotherhood, and, free, officers, which, marked, the, revolution, s, success, soon, soured, as, it, became, clear, the, secular, nationalist, ideology, of, nasserism, was, incompatible, with, the, islamism, of, the, brotherhood, nasser, had, secretly, set, up, an, organisation, that, would, sufficiently, oppose, the, muslim, brotherhood, once, he, came, to, power, this, organisation, was, called, tahreer, liberation, in, arabic, it, was, well, known, that, the, brotherhood, were, made, popular, by, their, extensive, social, programs, in, egypt, and, nasser, wanted, to, be, ready, once, he, had, taken, over, at, this, time, qutb, did, not, realize, nasser, s, alternate, plans, and, would, continue, to, meet, with, him, sometimes, for, 12, hours, a, day, to, discuss, a, post, monarchical, egypt, once, qutb, realized, that, nasser, had, taken, advantage, of, the, secrecy, between, the, free, officers, and, the, brotherhood, he, promptly, quit, nasser, then, tried, to, persuade, qutb, by, offering, him, any, position, he, wanted, in, egypt, except, its, kingship, saying, we, will, give, you, whatever, position, you, want, in, the, government, whether, it, s, the, ministry, of, education, ministry, of, arts, etc, qutb, refused, every, offer, having, understood, the, reality, of, nasser, s, plans, upset, that, nasser, would, not, enforce, a, government, based, on, islamic, ideology, qutb, and, other, brotherhood, members, allegedly, plotted, to, assassinate, him, in, 1954, the, alleged, attempt, was, foiled, and, qutb, was, jailed, soon, afterwards, the, egyptian, government, used, the, incident, to, justify, a, crackdown, on, various, members, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, for, their, vocal, opposition, towards, the, nasser, administration, during, his, first, three, years, in, prison, conditions, were, bad, and, qutb, was, tortured, in, later, years, he, was, allowed, more, mobility, including, the, opportunity, to, write, this, period, saw, the, composition, of, his, two, most, important, works, a, commentary, of, the, qur, an, fi, zilal, al, qur, an, in, the, shade, of, the, qur, an, and, a, manifesto, of, political, islam, called, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, milestones, these, works, represent, the, final, form, of, qutb, s, thought, encompassing, his, radically, anti, secular, and, anti, western, claims, based, on, his, interpretations, of, the, qur, an, islamic, history, and, the, social, and, political, problems, of, egypt, the, school, of, thought, he, inspired, has, become, known, as, qutbism, qutb, was, let, out, of, prison, in, may, 1964, at, the, behest, of, the, president, of, iraq, abdul, salam, arif, for, only, 8, months, before, being, rearrested, on, august, 9, 1965, he, was, accused, of, plotting, to, overthrow, the, state, and, subjected, to, what, some, consider, a, show, trial, many, of, the, charges, placed, against, qutb, in, court, were, taken, directly, from, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, and, he, adamantly, supported, his, written, statements, the, trial, culminated, in, a, death, sentence, for, qutb, and, six, other, members, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, he, was, sentenced, to, death, for, his, part, in, the, conspiracy, to, assassinate, the, president, and, other, egyptian, officials, and, personalities, though, he, was, not, the, instigator, or, leader, of, the, actual, plot, on, 29, august, 1966, he, was, executed, by, hanging, qutb, held, that, belief, in, matters, that, cannot, be, seen, or, are, imperceptible, was, an, important, sign, of, man, s, ability, to, accept, knowledge, from, fields, outside, of, science, the, concept, of, the, imperceptible, is, a, decisive, factor, in, distinguishing, man, from, animal, materialist, thinking, ancient, as, well, as, modern, has, tended, to, drag, man, back, to, an, irrational, existence, with, no, room, for, the, spiritual, where, everything, is, determined, by, sensory, means, alone, what, is, peddled, as, progressive, thought, is, no, more, than, dismal, regression, simultaneously, he, rejected, magical, beliefs, asserted, by, traditional, interpretations, of, islamic, narratives, such, as, rejecting, the, tradition, that, surah, al, falaq, was, meant, to, be, sent, down, to, break, a, curse, beginning, from, 1948, qutb, s, ideological, orientation, would, radically, shift, to, an, islamist, worldview, when, he, penned, his, first, islamist, treatise, al, ad, la, qutb, would, later, denounce, the, literary, works, he, published, during, the, 1940s, as, un, islamic, different, theories, have, been, advanced, as, to, why, qutb, turned, away, from, his, secularist, tendencies, towards, islamic, sharia, one, common, explanation, is, that, the, conditions, he, witnessed, in, prison, from, 1954, to, 1964, including, the, torture, and, murder, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, members, convinced, him, that, only, a, government, bound, by, islamic, law, could, prevent, such, abuses, another, is, that, qutb, s, experiences, in, america, as, a, darker, skinned, person, and, the, insufficiently, anti, western, policies, of, nasser, demonstrated, to, him, the, powerful, and, dangerous, allure, of, jahiliyyah, pre, islamic, ignorance, a, threat, unimaginable, in, qutb, s, estimation, to, the, secular, mind, in, the, opening, of, his, book, milestones, he, presents, the, following, views, it, is, necessary, for, the, new, leadership, to, preserve, and, develop, the, material, fruits, of, the, creative, genius, of, europe, and, also, to, provide, mankind, with, such, high, ideals, and, values, as, have, so, far, remained, undiscovered, by, mankind, and, which, will, also, acquaint, humanity, with, a, way, of, life, which, is, harmonious, with, human, nature, which, is, positive, and, constructive, and, which, is, practicable, democracy, in, the, west, has, become, infertile, to, such, an, extent, that, it, is, borrowing, from, the, systems, of, the, eastern, bloc, especially, in, the, economic, system, under, the, name, of, socialism, it, is, the, same, with, the, eastern, bloc, its, social, theories, foremost, among, which, is, marxism, in, the, beginning, attracted, not, only, a, large, number, of, people, from, the, east, but, also, from, the, west, as, it, was, a, way, of, life, based, on, a, creed, but, now, marxism, is, defeated, on, the, plane, of, thought, and, if, it, is, stated, that, not, a, single, nation, in, the, world, is, truly, marxist, it, will, not, be, an, exaggeration, on, the, whole, this, theory, conflicts, with, man, s, nature, and, its, needs, this, ideology, prospers, only, in, a, degenerate, society, or, in, a, society, which, has, become, cowed, as, a, result, of, some, form, of, prolonged, dictatorship, but, now, even, under, these, circumstances, its, materialistic, economic, system, is, failing, although, this, was, the, only, foundation, on, which, its, structure, was, based, russia, which, is, the, leader, of, the, communist, countries, is, itself, suffering, from, shortages, of, food, although, during, the, times, of, the, tsars, russia, used, to, produce, surplus, food, it, now, has, to, import, food, from, abroad, and, has, to, sell, its, reserves, of, gold, for, this, purpose, the, main, reason, for, this, is, the, failure, of, the, system, of, collective, farming, or, one, can, say, the, failure, of, a, system, which, is, against, human, nature, these, experiences, would, prompt, qutb, to, adopt, a, radical, stance, of, excommunicating, the, muslim, governments, as, well, as, their, supporters, out, of, the, pale, of, islam, these, revolutionary, ideas, published, through, his, 1960s, prison, writings, in, the, shade, of, the, qur, an, and, its, spin, off, milestones, would, lay, the, ideological, foundations, of, future, jihadist, movements, in, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, qutb, argues, that, anything, non, islamic, was, evil, and, corrupt, and, that, following, sharia, as, a, complete, system, extending, into, all, aspects, of, life, would, bring, every, kind, of, benefit, to, humanity, from, personal, and, social, peace, to, the, treasures, of, the, universe, qutb, s, experiences, as, an, egyptian, muslim, his, village, childhood, professional, career, and, activism, in, the, muslim, brotherhood, left, an, indelible, mark, on, his, theoretical, and, religious, works, even, qutb, s, early, secular, writing, shows, evidence, of, his, later, themes, for, example, qutb, s, autobiography, of, his, childhood, tifl, min, al, qarya, a, child, from, the, village, makes, little, mention, of, islam, or, political, theory, and, is, typically, classified, as, a, secular, literary, work, however, it, is, replete, with, references, to, village, mysticism, superstition, the, qur, an, and, incidences, of, injustice, qutb, s, later, work, developed, along, similar, themes, dealing, with, qur, anic, exegesis, social, justice, and, political, islam, qutb, s, career, as, a, writer, also, heavily, influenced, his, philosophy, in, al, taswiir, al, fanni, fil, quran, artistic, representation, in, the, qur, an, qutb, developed, a, literary, appreciation, of, the, qur, an, and, a, complementary, methodology, for, interpreting, the, text, his, hermeneutics, were, applied, in, his, extensive, commentary, on, the, qur, an, fi, zilal, al, qur, an, which, served, as, the, foundation, for, the, declarations, of, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, late, in, his, life, qutb, synthesized, his, personal, experiences, and, intellectual, development, in, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, a, religious, and, political, manifesto, for, what, he, believed, was, a, true, islamic, system, it, was, also, in, this, text, that, qutb, condemned, muslim, governments, such, as, abdul, nasser, s, regime, in, egypt, as, secular, with, their, legitimacy, based, on, human, and, thus, corrupt, rather, than, divine, authority, this, work, more, than, any, other, established, qutb, as, one, of, the, premier, islamists, of, the, 20th, century, and, perhaps, the, foremost, proponent, of, islamist, thought, in, that, era, qutb, denounced, secularism, as, an, inherently, oppressive, system, since, it, sabotaged, freedom, of, religion, by, constraining, all, religious, practice, to, the, private, realm, whereas, an, islamic, state, would, grant, full, religious, freedom, to, muslims, by, implementing, islamic, laws, publicly, while, delegating, non, muslim, faiths, to, the, private, realm, qutb, dissatisfied, with, the, condition, of, contemporary, islam, identified, its, benighted, state, as, having, two, principal, causes, the, first, was, that, many, muslims, were, forsaking, their, faith, in, the, qur, an, failing, to, enforce, sharia, law, this, had, led, to, the, virulent, spread, of, a, secular, culture, within, muslim, societies, which, with, the, assistance, of, the, innate, and, centuries, long, western, hatred, towards, islam, was, a, second, important, cause, of, the, straying, of, many, muslims, from, the, right, path, qutb, asserted, that, the, islamic, world, had, sunk, into, a, state, of, jahiliyyah, this, led, qutb, to, advocate, in, his, book, milestones, that, the, general, masses, weren, t, muslims, and, that, a, revolutionary, islamic, vanguard, should, return, the, ignorant, people, back, to, what, he, considered, as, pristine, islam, indeed, people, are, not, muslims, as, they, proclaim, to, be, as, long, as, they, live, the, life, of, jahiliyyah, if, someone, wishes, to, deceive, himself, or, to, deceive, others, by, believing, that, islam, can, be, brought, in, line, with, this, jahiliyyah, it, is, up, to, him, but, whether, this, deception, is, for, others, it, cannot, change, anything, of, the, actual, reality, this, is, not, islam, and, they, are, not, muslims, today, the, task, of, the, call, is, to, return, these, ignorant, people, to, islam, and, make, them, into, muslims, all, over, again, according, to, an, anonymous, work, the, lives, of, hassan, elbanna, syed, qutb, available, on, scribd, qutb, was, inspired, to, abandon, his, secular, world, view, for, islam, by, how, allah, prevented, the, ship, he, was, traveling, in, to, america, from, sinking, into, the, ocean, his, journey, started, when, he, studied, the, qur, an, in, a, literal, way, and, he, slowly, began, to, understand, the, principles, lined, in, the, religion, then, something, happened, to, him, in, america, to, remove, his, doubts, he, says, that, while, he, was, going, to, america, he, was, on, the, boat, ferry, and, he, saw, the, way, the, boat, he, was, travelling, in, was, rocking, in, the, huge, sea, all, under, the, control, of, allah, without, it, sinking, or, capsizing, at, that, point, he, realized, the, power, of, allah, he, said, iman, belief, entered, into, his, heart, due, to, this, his, second, scenario, was, in, san, francisco, when, he, went, on, top, of, a, mountain, and, he, could, see, the, whole, of, creation, in, front, of, him, and, he, realized, the, beauty, and, harmony, that, existed, amongst, the, creation, as, a, whole, he, said, that, the, sweetness, of, iman, hit, him, political, militant, islam, portal, qutb, s, mature, political, views, always, centered, on, islam, islam, as, a, complete, system, of, morality, justice, and, governance, whose, sharia, laws, and, principles, should, be, the, sole, basis, of, governance, and, everything, else, in, life, though, his, interpretation, of, it, varied, qutb, s, political, philosophy, has, been, described, as, an, attempt, to, instantiate, a, complex, and, multilayer, eschatological, vision, partly, grounded, in, the, counter, hegemonic, re, articulation, of, the, traditional, ideal, of, islamic, universalism, following, the, 1952, coup, he, espoused, a, just, dictatorship, that, would, grant, political, liberties, to, the, virtuous, alone, later, he, wrote, that, rule, by, sharia, law, would, require, essentially, no, government, at, all, in, an, earlier, work, qutb, described, military, jihad, as, defensive, islam, s, campaign, to, protect, itself, while, later, he, believed, jihad, must, be, offensive, on, the, issue, of, islamic, governance, qutb, differed, with, many, modernist, and, reformist, muslims, who, claimed, that, democracy, was, islamic, because, the, quranic, institution, of, shura, supported, elections, and, democracy, qutb, pointed, out, that, the, shura, chapter, of, the, qur, an, was, revealed, during, the, mekkan, period, and, therefore, it, does, not, deal, with, the, problem, of, government, it, makes, no, reference, to, elections, and, calls, only, for, the, ruler, to, consult, some, of, the, ruled, as, a, particular, case, of, the, general, rule, of, shura, qutb, also, opposed, the, then, popular, ideology, of, arab, nationalism, having, become, disillusioned, with, the, 1952, nasser, revolution, after, having, been, exposed, to, the, regime, s, practices, of, arbitrary, arrest, torture, and, deadly, violence, during, his, imprisonment, in, the, introduction, to, his, influential, 1964, theological, and, political, manifesto, ma, lim, f, a, ar, q, sayyid, qutb, declared, mankind, today, is, on, the, brink, of, a, precipice, not, because, of, the, danger, of, complete, annihilation, which, is, hanging, over, its, head, this, being, just, a, symptom, and, not, the, real, disease, but, because, humanity, is, devoid, of, those, vital, values, which, are, necessary, not, only, for, its, healthy, development, but, also, for, its, real, progress, even, the, western, world, realises, that, western, civilization, is, unable, to, present, any, healthy, values, for, the, guidance, of, mankind, it, is, the, same, with, the, eastern, bloc, its, social, theories, foremost, among, which, is, marxism, is, defeated, on, the, plane, of, thought, it, is, essential, for, mankind, to, have, new, leadership, at, this, crucial, and, bewildering, juncture, the, turn, of, islam, and, the, muslim, community, has, arrived, the, turn, of, islam, qutb, s, intense, dislike, of, the, west, and, ethnic, nationalism, notwithstanding, a, number, of, authors, believe, he, was, influenced, by, european, fascism, roxanne, l, euben, aziz, al, azmeh, khaled, abou, el, fadl, qutb, was, a, staunch, antisemite, influenced, by, islamists, like, rashid, rida, qutb, embraced, anti, semitic, conspiracy, theories, and, believed, in, the, existence, of, global, jewish, conspiracies, in, 1950, he, published, a, book, our, struggle, against, the, jews, which, forms, a, central, part, of, today, s, islamist, antisemitism, blaming, the, jews, for, advocating, secularising, reforms, in, the, ottoman, empire, and, inciting, various, turmoils, that, resulted, in, its, dissolution, qutb, wrote, a, jew, was, behind, the, incitement, of, various, kinds, of, tribal, arrogance, in, the, last, caliphate, the, fomenting, of, revolutions, which, began, with, the, removal, of, the, shari, ah, from, the, legislation, and, substituting, for, it, the, constitution, during, the, period, of, the, sultan, abdul, hamid, ii, and, the, hero, ataturk, s, ending, of, the, caliphate, then, behind, the, subsequent, war, declared, against, the, first, signs, of, islamic, revival, from, every, place, on, the, face, of, the, earth, stood, the, jews, qutb, felt, strongly, that, the, world, was, meant, to, serve, man, if, understood, properly, he, wrote, islam, teaches, that, god, created, the, physical, world, and, all, its, forces, for, man, s, own, use, and, benefit, man, is, specifically, taught, and, directed, to, study, the, world, around, him, discover, its, potential, and, utilize, all, his, environment, for, his, own, good, and, the, good, of, his, fellow, humans, any, harm, that, man, suffers, at, the, hands, of, nature, is, a, result, only, of, his, ignorance, or, lack, of, understanding, of, it, and, of, the, laws, governing, it, the, more, man, learns, about, nature, the, more, peaceful, and, harmonious, his, relationship, with, nature, and, the, environment, hence, the, notion, of, conquering, nature, can, readily, be, seen, as, cynical, and, negative, it, is, alien, to, islamic, perceptions, and, betrays, a, shameless, ignorance, of, the, spirit, in, which, the, world, has, been, created, and, the, divine, wisdom, that, underlies, it, this, exposure, to, abuse, of, power, crucially, contributed, to, the, ideas, in, qutb, s, prison, written, islamic, manifesto, ma, alim, fi, l, tariq, where, he, advocated, a, political, system, that, is, the, opposite, of, dictatorship, the, sharia, god, s, rule, on, earth, qutb, believed, that, there, are, only, two, kinds, of, societies, islamic, and, jahili, according, to, qutb, all, the, existing, muslim, societies, are, also, jahili, societies, since, they, relegated, the, legislative, attribute, of, god, to, others, he, further, wrote, the, muslim, community, has, long, ago, vanished, from, existence, and, from, observation, and, the, leadership, of, mankind, has, long, since, passed, to, other, ideologies, and, other, nations, other, concepts, and, other, systems, qutb, argued, qutb, emphasized, that, this, struggle, would, be, anything, but, easy, true, islam, would, transform, every, aspect, of, society, eliminating, everything, non, muslim, true, muslims, could, look, forward, to, lives, of, poverty, difficulty, frustration, torment, and, sacrifice, jahili, ersatz, muslims, jews, and, westerners, would, all, fight, and, conspire, against, islam, and, the, elimination, of, jahiliyyah, qutb, s, revolutionary, claims, of, the, islamic, world, being, upon, jahiliyya, and, absence, of, pure, islam, in, the, modern, era, set, him, apart, from, his, islamist, predecessors, for, mainstream, islamist, ideologues, like, hasan, al, banna, abul, a, la, mawdudi, and, abul, hasan, ali, nadwi, both, society, and, state, were, islamic, despite, the, influence, of, jahili, culture, of, the, west, although, his, work, has, motivated, and, mobilized, some, muslims, qutb, also, has, critics, following, the, publication, of, milestones, and, the, aborted, plot, against, the, nasser, government, mainstream, muslims, took, issue, with, qutb, s, contention, that, physical, power, and, jihad, had, to, be, used, to, overthrow, governments, attack, societies, and, the, institutions, and, traditions, of, the, muslim, but, according, to, qutb, jahili, world, the, ulama, of, al, azhar, university, school, took, the, unusual, step, following, his, death, of, putting, sayyid, qutb, on, their, index, of, heresy, declaring, him, a, deviant, munharif, moderate, muslims, on, the, other, hand, questioned, his, understanding, of, sharia, i, e, that, it, is, not, only, perfect, and, complete, but, completely, accessible, to, people, and, thus, the, solution, to, any, of, their, problems, also, criticized, is, his, dismissal, of, not, only, all, non, muslim, culture, but, many, centuries, of, muslim, learning, culture, and, beauty, following, the, first, four, caliphs, as, un, islamic, and, thus, worthless, conservative, criticism, went, further, condemning, qutb, s, islamist, reformist, ideas, proposed, in, his, earlier, works, in, the, 1950s, such, as, social, justice, in, islam, like, social, justice, and, redistributive, economics, banning, of, slavery, as, western, and, bid, ah, or, innovative, innovations, to, islam, being, forbidden, they, have, accused, qutb, of, amateur, scholarship, overuse, of, ijtihad, innovation, in, ijma, which, qutb, felt, should, not, be, limited, to, scholars, but, should, be, conducted, by, all, muslims, declaring, unlawful, what, allah, has, made, lawful, assorted, mistakes, in, aqeedah, belief, and, manhaj, methodology, qutb, has, also, come, under, fire, from, the, moderate, factions, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, represented, by, scholars, such, as, yusuf, al, qaradwi, who, staunchly, critiqued, qutb, s, ideas, on, jahiliyya, as, takfiri, extremism, in, spite, of, opposition, from, its, moderate, factions, the, mainstream, of, muslim, brotherhood, that, adheres, to, hassan, al, banna, s, school, of, thought, continues, to, extoll, qutb, as, al, shahid, al, hayy, the, living, martyr, the, muslim, brotherhood, also, has, militant, qutbist, factions, under, its, umbrella, that, continues, to, popularise, qutb, s, works, like, milestones, that, inspire, revolutionary, action, although, the, establishment, banni, factions, favour, gradualist, approach, to, establish, islamic, states, through, mainstream, political, participation, they, also, strongly, defend, qutb, s, legacy, to, shore, up, support, from, their, conservative, base, this, has, also, been, described, as, an, implicit, strategy, of, covert, support, to, the, qutbist, project, of, immediate, jihad, bi, l, sayf, jihad, through, the, sword, against, contemporary, regimes, while, muslim, brotherhood, focuses, on, long, term, islamization, strategy, through, education, mobilization, and, execution, despite, internal, tensions, within, the, group, qutbist, ideologues, continue, to, exert, inordinate, influence, in, various, echelons, of, the, muslim, brotherhood, and, have, become, a, vehicle, for, popularising, qutb, s, jihadist, ideas, amongst, the, masses, saudi, arabian, islamic, scholar, hamud, ibn, uqla, ash, shu, aybi, the, leader, of, the, shu, aybi, school, wrote, an, influential, treatise, a, word, of, truth, on, sayyid, qutb, in, defending, sayyid, qutb, from, his, theological, opponents, praising, qutb, as, a, mujaddid, ibn, uqla, accused, qutb, s, opponents, of, having, double, standards, in, their, criticism, he, extolled, qutb, as, a, martyr, who, upheld, tawhid, and, defended, sharia, in, the, face, of, tyrants, the, treatise, would, become, popular, amongst, contemporary, salafi, jihadist, movements, defending, qutb, ibn, uqla, wrote, sayyid, may, god, have, mercy, upon, him, was, considered, in, his, era, as, a, science, amongst, the, knowledge, of, the, people, who, s, curriculum, was, to, fight, the, oppressors, and, declare, them, as, disbelievers, he, was, also, one, of, the, unique, preachers, who, called, on, people, to, worship, their, lord, and, who, preached, the, unification, of, all, laws, to, none, other, than, allah, he, did, not, bow, down, under, the, enemies, of, allah, and, his, prophet, like, jamal, abdel, nasser, and, his, likes, no, one, was, happier, by, his, death, than, those, the, targeting, of, sayyid, qutb, may, god, have, mercy, upon, him, wasn, t, just, due, to, his, personality, the, goal, of, his, stabbing, wasn, t, his, downfall, what, still, worries, his, enemies, and, their, followers, is,

previous, critique, of, sayyid, qutb, stating, yes, sayyid, qutb, must, be, refuted, but, with, composure, and, dispassionately, but, that, does, not, mean, that, we, must, show, him, hostility, or, forget, that, he, has, certain, merits, the, important, thing, is, that, he, is, a, muslim, and, an, islamic, writer, who, was, killed, for, the, sake, of, da, wa, and, that, those, who, killed, him, are, the, enemies, of, god, alongside, notable, islamists, like, abul, a, la, mawdudi, hasan, al, banna, and, ruhollah, khomeini, sayyid, qutb, is, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, muslim, thinkers, or, activists, of, the, modern, era, not, only, for, his, ideas, but, also, for, what, many, see, as, his, martyr, s, death, qutb, has, been, designated, as, shaheed, or, martyr, to, fellow,

rahman, shukri, mustafa, etc, according, to, authors, daniel, benjamin, and, steven, simon, it, was, sayyid, qutb, who, fused, together, the, core, elements, of, modern, islamism, the, kharijites,

relating, to, faith, while, his, main, goal, in, writing, the, book, in, the, shade, of, the, qur, an, was, to, restore, the, centrality, of, faith, in, the, consciousness, and, imagination, of, muslims, and, to, kindle, a, cognitive, revolution, that, would, bring, about, a, political, and, social, process, that, will, lead, to, the, renewal, of, the, islamic, tradition, qutb, s, theoretical, work, on, islamic, advocacy, social, justice, and, education, has, left, a, significant, mark, not, only, on, the, muslim, brotherhood, but, also, muslim, scholars, from, all,
