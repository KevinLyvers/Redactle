francis, harry, compton, crick, om, frs, 8, june, 1916, 28, july, 2004, was, an, english, molecular, biologist, biophysicist, and, neuroscientist, he, james, watson, rosalind, franklin, and, maurice, wilkins, played, crucial, roles, in, deciphering, the, helical, structure, of, the, dna, molecule, crick, and, watson, s, paper, in, nature, in, 1953, laid, the, groundwork, for, understanding, dna, structure, and, functions, together, with, maurice, wilkins, they, were, jointly, awarded, the, 1962, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, for, their, discoveries, concerning, the, molecular, structure, of, nucleic, acids, and, its, significance, for, information, transfer, in, living, material, crick, was, an, important, theoretical, molecular, biologist, and, played, a, crucial, role, in, research, related, to, revealing, the, helical, structure, of, dna, he, is, widely, known, for, the, use, of, the, term, central, dogma, to, summarise, the, idea, that, once, information, is, transferred, from, nucleic, acids, dna, or, rna, to, proteins, it, cannot, flow, back, to, nucleic, acids, in, other, words, the, final, step, in, the, flow, of, information, from, nucleic, acids, to, proteins, is, irreversible, during, the, remainder, of, his, career, he, held, the, post, of, j, w, kieckhefer, distinguished, research, professor, at, the, salk, institute, for, biological, studies, in, la, jolla, california, his, later, research, centered, on, theoretical, neurobiology, and, attempts, to, advance, the, scientific, study, of, human, consciousness, he, remained, in, this, post, until, his, death, he, was, editing, a, manuscript, on, his, death, bed, a, scientist, until, the, bitter, end, according, to, christof, koch, crick, was, the, first, son, of, harry, crick, and, annie, elizabeth, crick, n, e, wilkins, he, was, born, on, 8, june, 1916, and, raised, in, weston, favell, then, a, small, village, near, the, english, town, of, northampton, in, which, crick, s, father, and, uncle, ran, the, family, s, boot, and, shoe, factory, his, grandfather, walter, drawbridge, crick, an, amateur, naturalist, wrote, a, survey, of, local, foraminifera, single, celled, protists, with, shells, corresponded, with, charles, darwin, and, had, two, gastropods, snails, or, slugs, named, after, him, at, an, early, age, francis, was, attracted, to, science, and, what, he, could, learn, about, it, from, books, as, a, child, he, was, taken, to, church, by, his, parents, but, by, about, age, 12, he, said, he, did, not, want, to, go, any, more, as, he, preferred, a, scientific, search, for, answers, over, religious, belief, walter, crick, his, uncle, lived, in, a, small, house, on, the, south, side, of, abington, avenue, he, had, a, shed, at, the, bottom, of, his, little, garden, where, he, taught, crick, to, blow, glass, do, chemical, experiments, and, to, make, photographic, prints, when, he, was, eight, or, nine, he, transferred, to, the, most, junior, form, of, the, northampton, grammar, school, on, the, billing, road, this, was, about, 1, 25, mi, 2, km, from, his, home, so, he, could, walk, there, and, back, by, park, avenue, south, and, abington, park, crescent, but, he, more, often, went, by, bus, or, later, by, bicycle, the, teaching, in, the, higher, forms, was, satisfactory, but, not, as, stimulating, after, the, age, of, 14, he, was, educated, at, mill, hill, school, in, london, on, a, scholarship, where, he, studied, mathematics, physics, and, chemistry, with, his, best, friend, john, shilston, he, shared, the, walter, knox, prize, for, chemistry, on, mill, hill, school, s, foundation, day, friday, 7, july, 1933, he, declared, that, his, success, was, founded, on, the, quality, of, teaching, he, received, whilst, a, pupil, at, mill, hill, crick, studied, at, university, college, london, ucl, a, constituent, college, of, the, university, of, london, and, earned, a, bachelor, of, science, degree, awarded, by, the, university, of, london, in, 1937, crick, began, a, phd, at, ucl, but, was, interrupted, by, world, war, ii, he, later, became, a, phd, student, and, honorary, fellow, of, gonville, and, caius, college, cambridge, and, mainly, worked, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, and, the, medical, research, council, mrc, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, in, cambridge, he, was, also, an, honorary, fellow, of, churchill, college, cambridge, and, of, university, college, london, crick, began, a, phd, research, project, on, measuring, the, viscosity, of, water, at, high, temperatures, which, he, later, described, as, the, dullest, problem, imaginable, in, the, laboratory, of, physicist, edward, neville, da, costa, andrade, at, university, college, london, but, with, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, particular, an, incident, during, the, battle, of, britain, when, a, bomb, fell, through, the, roof, of, the, laboratory, and, destroyed, his, experimental, apparatus, crick, was, deflected, from, a, possible, career, in, physics, during, his, second, year, as, a, phd, student, however, he, was, awarded, the, carey, foster, research, prize, a, great, honour, he, did, postdoctoral, work, at, the, brooklyn, collegiate, and, polytechnic, institute, now, part, of, the, new, york, university, tandon, school, of, engineering, during, world, war, ii, he, worked, for, the, admiralty, research, laboratory, from, which, many, notable, scientists, emerged, including, david, bates, robert, boyd, thomas, gaskell, george, deacon, john, gunn, harrie, massey, and, nevill, mott, he, worked, on, the, design, of, magnetic, and, acoustic, mines, and, was, instrumental, in, designing, a, new, mine, that, was, effective, against, german, minesweepers, in, 1947, aged, 31, crick, began, studying, biology, and, became, part, of, an, important, migration, of, physical, scientists, into, biology, research, this, migration, was, made, possible, by, the, newly, won, influence, of, physicists, such, as, sir, john, randall, who, had, helped, win, the, war, with, inventions, such, as, radar, crick, had, to, adjust, from, the, elegance, and, deep, simplicity, of, physics, to, the, elaborate, chemical, mechanisms, that, natural, selection, had, evolved, over, billions, of, years, he, described, this, transition, as, almost, as, if, one, had, to, be, born, again, according, to, crick, the, experience, of, learning, physics, had, taught, him, something, important, hubris, and, the, conviction, that, since, physics, was, already, a, success, great, advances, should, also, be, possible, in, other, sciences, such, as, biology, crick, felt, that, this, attitude, encouraged, him, to, be, more, daring, than, typical, biologists, who, tended, to, concern, themselves, with, the, daunting, problems, of, biology, and, not, the, past, successes, of, physics, for, the, better, part, of, two, years, crick, worked, on, the, physical, properties, of, cytoplasm, at, cambridge, s, strangeways, research, laboratory, headed, by, honor, bridget, fell, with, a, medical, research, council, studentship, until, he, joined, max, perutz, and, john, kendrew, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, the, cavendish, laboratory, at, cambridge, was, under, the, general, direction, of, sir, lawrence, bragg, who, had, won, the, nobel, prize, in, 1915, at, the, age, of, 25, bragg, was, influential, in, the, effort, to, beat, a, leading, american, chemist, linus, pauling, to, the, discovery, of, dna, s, structure, after, having, been, pipped, at, the, post, by, pauling, s, success, in, determining, the, alpha, helix, structure, of, proteins, at, the, same, time, bragg, s, cavendish, laboratory, was, also, effectively, competing, with, king, s, college, london, whose, biophysics, department, was, under, the, direction, of, randall, randall, had, refused, crick, s, application, to, work, at, king, s, college, francis, crick, and, maurice, wilkins, of, king, s, college, were, personal, friends, which, influenced, subsequent, scientific, events, as, much, as, the, close, friendship, between, crick, and, james, watson, crick, and, wilkins, first, met, at, king, s, college, and, not, as, erroneously, recorded, by, two, authors, at, the, admiralty, during, world, war, ii, crick, married, twice, and, fathered, three, children, his, brother, anthony, born, in, 1918, predeceased, him, in, 1966, spouses, children, crick, died, of, colon, cancer, on, the, morning, of, 28, july, 2004, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, ucsd, thornton, hospital, in, la, jolla, he, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, scattered, into, the, pacific, ocean, a, public, memorial, was, held, on, 27, september, 2004, at, the, salk, institute, la, jolla, near, san, diego, california, guest, speakers, included, james, watson, sydney, brenner, alex, rich, seymour, benzer, aaron, klug, christof, koch, pat, churchland, vilayanur, ramachandran, tomaso, poggio, leslie, orgel, terry, sejnowski, his, son, michael, crick, and, his, younger, daughter, jacqueline, nichols, a, private, memorial, for, family, and, colleagues, was, held, on, 3, august, 2004, crick, s, nobel, prize, medal, and, diploma, from, the, nobel, committee, was, sold, at, auction, in, june, 2013, for, 2, 270, 000, it, was, bought, by, jack, wang, the, ceo, of, chinese, medical, company, biomobie, 20, of, the, sale, price, of, the, medal, was, donated, to, the, francis, crick, institute, in, london, crick, was, interested, in, two, fundamental, unsolved, problems, of, biology, how, molecules, make, the, transition, from, the, non, living, to, the, living, and, how, the, brain, makes, a, conscious, mind, he, realised, that, his, background, made, him, more, qualified, for, research, on, the, first, topic, and, the, field, of, biophysics, it, was, at, this, time, of, crick, s, transition, from, physics, to, biology, that, he, was, influenced, by, both, linus, pauling, and, erwin, schr, dinger, it, was, clear, in, theory, that, covalent, bonds, in, biological, molecules, could, provide, the, structural, stability, needed, to, hold, genetic, information, in, cells, it, only, remained, as, an, exercise, of, experimental, biology, to, discover, exactly, which, molecule, was, the, genetic, molecule, in, crick, s, view, charles, darwin, s, theory, of, evolution, by, natural, selection, gregor, mendel, s, genetics, and, knowledge, of, the, molecular, basis, of, genetics, when, combined, revealed, the, secret, of, life, crick, had, the, very, optimistic, view, that, life, would, very, soon, be, created, in, a, test, tube, however, some, people, such, as, fellow, researcher, and, colleague, esther, lederberg, thought, that, crick, was, unduly, optimistic, it, was, clear, that, some, macromolecule, such, as, a, protein, was, likely, to, be, the, genetic, molecule, however, it, was, well, known, that, proteins, are, structural, and, functional, macromolecules, some, of, which, carry, out, enzymatic, reactions, of, cells, in, the, 1940s, some, evidence, had, been, found, pointing, to, another, macromolecule, dna, the, other, major, component, of, chromosomes, as, a, candidate, genetic, molecule, in, the, 1944, avery, macleod, mccarty, experiment, oswald, avery, and, his, collaborators, showed, that, a, heritable, phenotypic, difference, could, be, caused, in, bacteria, by, providing, them, with, a, particular, dna, molecule, however, other, evidence, was, interpreted, as, suggesting, that, dna, was, structurally, uninteresting, and, possibly, just, a, molecular, scaffold, for, the, apparently, more, interesting, protein, molecules, crick, was, in, the, right, place, in, the, right, frame, of, mind, at, the, right, time, 1949, to, join, max, perutz, s, project, at, the, university, of, cambridge, and, he, began, to, work, on, the, x, ray, crystallography, of, proteins, x, ray, crystallography, theoretically, offered, the, opportunity, to, reveal, the, molecular, structure, of, large, molecules, like, proteins, and, dna, but, there, were, serious, technical, problems, then, preventing, x, ray, crystallography, from, being, applicable, to, such, large, molecules, crick, taught, himself, the, mathematical, theory, of, x, ray, crystallography, during, the, period, of, crick, s, study, of, x, ray, diffraction, researchers, in, the, cambridge, lab, were, attempting, to, determine, the, most, stable, helical, conformation, of, amino, acid, chains, in, proteins, the, alpha, helix, linus, pauling, was, the, first, to, identify, the, 3, 6, amino, acids, per, helix, turn, ratio, of, the, alpha, helix, crick, was, witness, to, the, kinds, of, errors, that, his, co, workers, made, in, their, failed, attempts, to, make, a, correct, molecular, model, of, the, alpha, helix, these, turned, out, to, be, important, lessons, that, could, be, applied, in, the, future, to, the, helical, structure, of, dna, for, example, he, learned, the, importance, of, the, structural, rigidity, that, double, bonds, confer, on, molecular, structures, which, is, relevant, both, to, peptide, bonds, in, proteins, and, the, structure, of, nucleotides, in, dna, in, 1951, and, 1952, together, with, william, cochran, and, vladimir, vand, crick, assisted, in, the, development, of, a, mathematical, theory, of, x, ray, diffraction, by, a, helical, molecule, this, theoretical, result, matched, well, with, x, ray, data, for, proteins, that, contain, sequences, of, amino, acids, in, the, alpha, helix, conformation, helical, diffraction, theory, turned, out, to, also, be, useful, for, understanding, the, structure, of, dna, late, in, 1951, crick, started, working, with, james, watson, at, cavendish, laboratory, at, the, university, of, cambridge, england, using, photo, 51, the, x, ray, diffraction, results, of, rosalind, franklin, and, her, graduate, student, raymond, gosling, of, king, s, college, london, given, to, them, by, gosling, and, franklin, s, colleague, wilkins, watson, and, crick, together, developed, a, model, for, a, helical, structure, of, dna, which, they, published, in, 1953, for, this, and, subsequent, work, they, were, jointly, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1962, with, wilkins, when, watson, came, to, cambridge, crick, was, a, 35, year, old, graduate, student, due, to, his, work, during, wwii, and, watson, was, only, 23, but, had, already, obtained, a, phd, they, shared, an, interest, in, the, fundamental, problem, of, learning, how, genetic, information, might, be, stored, in, molecular, form, watson, and, crick, talked, endlessly, about, dna, and, the, idea, that, it, might, be, possible, to, guess, a, good, molecular, model, of, its, structure, a, key, piece, of, experimentally, derived, information, came, from, x, ray, diffraction, images, that, had, been, obtained, by, wilkins, franklin, and, gosling, in, november, 1951, wilkins, came, to, cambridge, and, shared, his, data, with, watson, and, crick, alexander, stokes, another, expert, in, helical, diffraction, theory, and, wilkins, both, at, king, s, college, had, reached, the, conclusion, that, x, ray, diffraction, data, for, dna, indicated, that, the, molecule, had, a, helical, structure, but, franklin, vehemently, disputed, this, conclusion, stimulated, by, their, discussions, with, wilkins, and, what, watson, learned, by, attending, a, talk, given, by, franklin, about, her, work, on, dna, crick, and, watson, produced, and, showed, off, an, erroneous, first, model, of, dna, their, hurry, to, produce, a, model, of, dna, structure, was, driven, in, part, by, the, knowledge, that, they, were, competing, against, linus, pauling, given, pauling, s, recent, success, in, discovering, the, alpha, helix, they, feared, that, pauling, might, also, be, the, first, to, determine, the, structure, of, dna, many, have, speculated, about, what, might, have, happened, had, pauling, been, able, to, travel, to, britain, as, planned, in, may, 1952, as, it, was, his, political, activities, caused, his, travel, to, be, restricted, by, the, united, states, government, and, he, did, not, visit, the, uk, until, later, at, which, point, he, met, none, of, the, dna, researchers, in, england, at, any, rate, he, was, preoccupied, with, proteins, at, the, time, not, dna, watson, and, crick, were, not, officially, working, on, dna, crick, was, writing, his, phd, thesis, watson, also, had, other, work, such, as, trying, to, obtain, crystals, of, myoglobin, for, x, ray, diffraction, experiments, in, 1952, watson, performed, x, ray, diffraction, on, tobacco, mosaic, virus, and, found, results, indicating, that, it, had, helical, structure, having, failed, once, watson, and, crick, were, now, somewhat, reluctant, to, try, again, and, for, a, while, they, were, forbidden, to, make, further, efforts, to, find, a, molecular, model, of, dna, of, great, importance, to, the, model, building, effort, of, watson, and, crick, was, rosalind, franklin, s, understanding, of, basic, chemistry, which, indicated, that, the, hydrophilic, phosphate, containing, backbones, of, the, nucleotide, chains, of, dna, should, be, positioned, so, as, to, interact, with, water, molecules, on, the, outside, of, the, molecule, while, the, hydrophobic, bases, should, be, packed, into, the, core, franklin, shared, this, chemical, knowledge, with, watson, and, crick, when, she, pointed, out, to, them, that, their, first, model, from, 1951, with, the, phosphates, inside, was, obviously, wrong, crick, described, what, he, saw, as, the, failure, of, wilkins, and, franklin, to, cooperate, and, work, towards, finding, a, molecular, model, of, dna, as, a, major, reason, why, he, and, watson, eventually, made, a, second, attempt, to, do, so, they, asked, for, and, received, permission, to, do, so, from, both, william, lawrence, bragg, and, wilkins, to, construct, their, model, of, dna, watson, and, crick, made, use, of, information, from, unpublished, x, ray, diffraction, images, of, franklin, s, shown, at, meetings, and, freely, shared, by, wilkins, including, preliminary, accounts, of, franklin, s, results, photographs, of, the, x, ray, images, that, were, included, in, a, written, progress, report, for, the, king, s, college, laboratory, of, sir, john, randall, from, late, 1952, it, is, a, matter, of, debate, whether, watson, and, crick, should, have, had, access, to, franklin, s, results, without, her, knowledge, or, permission, and, before, she, had, a, chance, to, formally, publish, the, results, of, her, detailed, analysis, of, her, x, ray, diffraction, data, which, were, included, in, the, progress, report, however, watson, and, crick, found, fault, in, her, steadfast, assertion, that, according, to, her, data, a, helical, structure, was, not, the, only, possible, shape, for, dna, so, they, had, a, dilemma, in, an, effort, to, clarify, this, issue, max, ferdinand, perutz, later, published, what, had, been, in, the, progress, report, and, suggested, that, nothing, was, in, the, report, that, franklin, herself, had, not, said, in, her, talk, attended, by, watson, in, late, 1951, perutz, explained, that, the, report, was, to, a, medical, research, council, mrc, committee, that, had, been, created, to, establish, contact, between, the, different, groups, of, people, working, for, the, council, randall, s, and, perutz, s, laboratories, were, both, funded, by, the, mrc, it, is, also, not, clear, how, important, franklin, s, unpublished, results, from, the, progress, report, actually, were, for, the, model, building, done, by, watson, and, crick, after, the, first, crude, x, ray, diffraction, images, of, dna, were, collected, in, the, 1930s, william, astbury, had, talked, about, stacks, of, nucleotides, spaced, at, 3, 4, angstr, m, 0, 34, nanometre, intervals, in, dna, a, citation, to, astbury, s, earlier, x, ray, diffraction, work, was, one, of, only, eight, references, in, franklin, s, first, paper, on, dna, analysis, of, astbury, s, published, dna, results, and, the, better, x, ray, diffraction, images, collected, by, wilkins, and, franklin, revealed, the, helical, nature, of, dna, it, was, possible, to, predict, the, number, of, bases, stacked, within, a, single, turn, of, the, dna, helix, 10, per, turn, a, full, turn, of, the, helix, is, 27, angstr, ms, in, the, compact, a, form, 34, angstr, ms, in, the, wetter, b, form, wilkins, shared, this, information, about, the, b, form, of, dna, with, crick, and, watson, crick, did, not, see, franklin, s, b, form, x, ray, images, photo, 51, until, after, the, dna, double, helix, model, was, published, one, of, the, few, references, cited, by, watson, and, crick, when, they, published, their, model, of, dna, was, to, a, published, article, that, included, sven, furberg, s, dna, model, that, had, the, bases, on, the, inside, thus, the, watson, and, crick, model, was, not, the, first, bases, in, model, to, be, proposed, furberg, s, results, had, also, provided, the, correct, orientation, of, the, dna, sugars, with, respect, to, the, bases, during, their, model, building, crick, and, watson, learned, that, an, antiparallel, orientation, of, the, two, nucleotide, chain, backbones, worked, best, to, orient, the, base, pairs, in, the, centre, of, a, double, helix, crick, s, access, to, franklin, s, progress, report, of, late, 1952, is, what, made, crick, confident, that, dna, was, a, double, helix, with, antiparallel, chains, but, there, were, other, chains, of, reasoning, and, sources, of, information, that, also, led, to, these, conclusions, as, a, result, of, leaving, king, s, college, for, birkbeck, college, franklin, was, asked, by, john, randall, to, give, up, her, work, on, dna, when, it, became, clear, to, wilkins, and, the, supervisors, of, watson, and, crick, that, franklin, was, going, to, the, new, job, and, that, linus, pauling, was, working, on, the, structure, of, dna, they, were, willing, to, share, franklin, s, data, with, watson, and, crick, in, the, hope, that, they, could, find, a, good, model, of, dna, before, pauling, was, able, franklin, s, x, ray, diffraction, data, for, dna, and, her, systematic, analysis, of, dna, s, structural, features, were, useful, to, watson, and, crick, in, guiding, them, towards, a, correct, molecular, model, the, key, problem, for, watson, and, crick, which, could, not, be, resolved, by, the, data, from, king, s, college, was, to, guess, how, the, nucleotide, bases, pack, into, the, core, of, the, dna, double, helix, another, key, to, finding, the, correct, structure, of, dna, was, the, so, called, chargaff, ratios, experimentally, determined, ratios, of, the, nucleotide, subunits, of, dna, the, amount, of, guanine, is, equal, to, cytosine, and, the, amount, of, adenine, is, equal, to, thymine, a, visit, by, erwin, chargaff, to, england, in, 1952, reinforced, the, salience, of, this, important, fact, for, watson, and, crick, the, significance, of, these, ratios, for, the, structure, of, dna, were, not, recognised, until, watson, persisting, in, building, structural, models, realised, that, a, t, and, c, g, pairs, are, structurally, similar, in, particular, the, length, of, each, base, pair, is, the, same, chargaff, had, also, pointed, out, to, watson, that, in, the, aqueous, saline, environment, of, the, cell, the, predominant, tautomers, of, the, pyrimidine, c, and, t, bases, would, be, the, amine, and, keto, configurations, of, cytosine, and, thymine, rather, than, the, imino, and, enol, forms, that, crick, and, watson, had, assumed, they, consulted, jerry, donohue, who, confirmed, the, most, likely, structures, of, the, nucleotide, bases, the, base, pairs, are, held, together, by, hydrogen, bonds, the, same, non, covalent, interaction, that, stabilise, the, protein, helix, the, correct, structures, were, essential, for, the, positioning, of, the, hydrogen, bonds, these, insights, led, watson, to, deduce, the, true, biological, relationships, of, the, a, t, and, c, g, pairs, after, the, discovery, of, the, hydrogen, bonded, a, t, and, c, g, pairs, watson, and, crick, soon, had, their, anti, parallel, double, helical, model, of, dna, with, the, hydrogen, bonds, at, the, core, of, the, helix, providing, a, way, to, unzip, the, two, complementary, strands, for, easy, replication, the, last, key, requirement, for, a, likely, model, of, the, genetic, molecule, as, important, as, crick, s, contributions, to, the, discovery, of, the, double, helical, dna, model, were, he, stated, that, without, the, chance, to, collaborate, with, watson, he, would, not, have, found, the, structure, by, himself, crick, did, tentatively, attempt, to, perform, some, experiments, on, nucleotide, base, pairing, but, he, was, more, of, a, theoretical, biologist, than, an, experimental, biologist, there, was, another, near, discovery, of, the, base, pairing, rules, in, early, 1952, crick, had, started, to, think, about, interactions, between, the, bases, he, asked, john, griffith, to, try, to, calculate, attractive, interactions, between, the, dna, bases, from, chemical, principles, and, quantum, mechanics, griffith, s, best, guess, was, that, a, t, and, g, c, were, attractive, pairs, at, that, time, crick, was, not, aware, of, chargaff, s, rules, and, he, made, little, of, griffith, s, calculations, although, it, did, start, him, thinking, about, complementary, replication, identification, of, the, correct, base, pairing, rules, a, t, g, c, was, achieved, by, watson, playing, with, cardboard, cut, out, models, of, the, nucleotide, bases, much, in, the, manner, that, linus, pauling, had, discovered, the, protein, alpha, helix, a, few, years, earlier, the, watson, and, crick, discovery, of, the, dna, double, helix, structure, was, made, possible, by, their, willingness, to, combine, theory, modelling, and, experimental, results, albeit, mostly, done, by, others, to, achieve, their, goal, the, dna, double, helix, structure, proposed, by, watson, and, crick, was, based, upon, watson, crick, bonds, between, the, four, bases, most, frequently, found, in, dna, a, c, t, g, and, rna, a, c, u, g, however, later, research, showed, that, triple, stranded, quadruple, stranded, and, other, more, complex, dna, molecular, structures, required, hoogsteen, base, pairing, the, entire, field, of, synthetic, biology, began, with, work, by, researchers, such, as, erik, t, kool, in, which, bases, other, than, a, c, t, and, g, are, used, in, a, synthetic, dna, in, addition, to, synthetic, dna, there, are, also, attempts, to, construct, synthetic, codons, synthetic, endonucleases, synthetic, proteins, and, synthetic, zinc, fingers, using, synthetic, dna, instead, of, there, being, 4, 3, codons, if, there, are, n, new, bases, there, could, be, as, many, as, n, 3, codons, research, is, currently, being, done, to, see, if, codons, can, be, expanded, to, more, than, 3, bases, these, new, codons, can, code, for, new, amino, acids, these, synthetic, molecules, can, be, used, not, only, in, medicine, but, in, creation, of, new, materials, the, discovery, was, made, on, 28, february, 1953, the, first, watson, crick, paper, appeared, in, nature, on, 25, april, 1953, sir, lawrence, bragg, the, director, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, where, watson, and, crick, worked, gave, a, talk, at, guy, s, hospital, medical, school, in, london, on, thursday, 14, may, 1953, which, resulted, in, an, article, by, ritchie, calder, in, the, news, chronicle, of, london, on, friday, 15, may, 1953, entitled, why, you, are, you, nearer, secret, of, life, the, news, reached, readers, of, the, new, york, times, the, next, day, victor, k, mcelheny, in, researching, his, biography, watson, and, dna, making, a, scientific, revolution, found, a, clipping, of, a, six, paragraph, new, york, times, article, written, from, london, and, dated, 16, may, 1953, with, the, headline, form, of, life, unit, in, cell, is, scanned, the, article, ran, in, an, early, edition, and, was, then, pulled, to, make, space, for, news, deemed, more, important, the, new, york, times, subsequently, ran, a, longer, article, on, 12, june, 1953, the, university, s, undergraduate, newspaper, varsity, also, ran, its, own, short, article, on, the, discovery, on, saturday, 30, may, 1953, bragg, s, original, announcement, of, the, discovery, at, a, solvay, conference, on, proteins, in, belgium, on, 8, april, 1953, went, unreported, by, the, british, press, in, a, seven, page, handwritten, letter, to, his, son, at, a, british, boarding, school, on, 19, march, 1953, crick, explained, his, discovery, beginning, the, letter, my, dear, michael, jim, watson, and, i, have, probably, made, a, most, important, discovery, the, letter, was, put, up, for, auction, at, christie, s, new, york, on, 10, april, 2013, with, an, estimate, of, 1, to, 2, million, eventually, selling, for, 6, 059, 750, the, largest, amount, ever, paid, for, a, letter, at, auction, sydney, brenner, jack, dunitz, dorothy, hodgkin, leslie, orgel, and, beryl, m, oughton, were, some, of, the, first, people, in, april, 1953, to, see, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, constructed, by, crick, and, watson, at, the, time, they, were, working, at, oxford, university, s, chemistry, department, all, were, impressed, by, the, new, dna, model, especially, brenner, who, subsequently, worked, with, crick, at, cambridge, in, the, cavendish, laboratory, and, the, new, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, according, to, the, late, dr, beryl, oughton, later, rimmer, they, all, travelled, together, in, two, cars, once, dorothy, hodgkin, announced, to, them, that, they, were, off, to, cambridge, to, see, the, model, of, the, structure, of, dna, orgel, also, later, worked, with, crick, at, the, salk, institute, for, biological, studies, crick, was, often, described, as, very, talkative, with, watson, in, the, double, helix, implying, lack, of, modesty, his, personality, combined, with, his, scientific, accomplishments, produced, many, opportunities, for, crick, to, stimulate, reactions, from, others, both, inside, and, outside, the, scientific, world, which, was, the, centre, of, his, intellectual, and, professional, life, crick, spoke, rapidly, and, rather, loudly, and, had, an, infectious, and, reverberating, laugh, and, a, lively, sense, of, humour, one, colleague, from, the, salk, institute, described, him, as, a, brainstorming, intellectual, powerhouse, with, a, mischievous, smile, francis, was, never, mean, spirited, just, incisive, he, detected, microscopic, flaws, in, logic, in, a, room, full, of, smart, scientists, francis, continually, re, earned, his, position, as, the, heavyweight, champ, soon, after, crick, s, death, there, have, been, allegations, about, him, having, used, lsd, when, he, came, to, the, idea, of, the, helix, structure, of, the, dna, while, he, almost, certainly, did, use, lsd, it, is, unlikely, that, he, did, so, as, early, as, 1953, in, 1954, at, the, age, of, 37, crick, completed, his, phd, thesis, x, ray, diffraction, polypeptides, and, proteins, and, received, his, degree, crick, then, worked, in, the, laboratory, of, david, harker, at, brooklyn, polytechnic, institute, where, he, continued, to, develop, his, skills, in, the, analysis, of, x, ray, diffraction, data, for, proteins, working, primarily, on, ribonuclease, and, the, mechanisms, of, protein, synthesis, david, harker, the, american, x, ray, crystallographer, was, described, as, the, john, wayne, of, crystallography, by, vittorio, luzzati, a, crystallographer, at, the, centre, for, molecular, genetics, in, gif, sur, yvette, near, paris, who, had, worked, with, rosalind, franklin, after, the, discovery, of, the, double, helix, model, of, dna, crick, s, interests, quickly, turned, to, the, biological, implications, of, the, structure, in, 1953, watson, and, crick, published, another, article, in, nature, which, stated, it, therefore, seems, likely, that, the, precise, sequence, of, the, bases, is, the, code, that, carries, the, genetical, information, in, 1956, crick, and, watson, speculated, on, the, structure, of, small, viruses, they, suggested, that, spherical, viruses, such, as, tomato, bushy, stunt, virus, had, icosahedral, symmetry, and, were, made, from, 60, identical, subunits, after, his, short, time, in, new, york, crick, returned, to, cambridge, where, he, worked, until, 1976, at, which, time, he, moved, to, california, crick, engaged, in, several, x, ray, diffraction, collaborations, such, as, one, with, alexander, rich, on, the, structure, of, collagen, however, crick, was, quickly, drifting, away, from, continued, work, related, to, his, expertise, in, the, interpretation, of, x, ray, diffraction, patterns, of, proteins, george, gamow, established, a, group, of, scientists, interested, in, the, role, of, rna, as, an, intermediary, between, dna, as, the, genetic, storage, molecule, in, the, nucleus, of, cells, and, the, synthesis, of, proteins, in, the, cytoplasm, the, rna, tie, club, it, was, clear, to, crick, that, there, had, to, be, a, code, by, which, a, short, sequence, of, nucleotides, would, specify, a, particular, amino, acid, in, a, newly, synthesised, protein, in, 1956, crick, wrote, an, informal, paper, about, the, genetic, coding, problem, for, the, small, group, of, scientists, in, gamow, s, rna, group, in, this, article, crick, reviewed, the, evidence, supporting, the, idea, that, there, was, a, common, set, of, about, 20, amino, acids, used, to, synthesise, proteins, crick, proposed, that, there, was, a, corresponding, set, of, small, adaptor, molecules, that, would, hydrogen, bond, to, short, sequences, of, a, nucleic, acid, and, also, link, to, one, of, the, amino, acids, he, also, explored, the, many, theoretical, possibilities, by, which, short, nucleic, acid, sequences, might, code, for, the, 20, amino, acids, during, the, mid, to, late, 1950s, crick, was, very, much, intellectually, engaged, in, sorting, out, the, mystery, of, how, proteins, are, synthesised, by, 1958, crick, s, thinking, had, matured, and, he, could, list, in, an, orderly, way, all, of, the, key, features, of, the, protein, synthesis, process, the, adaptor, molecules, were, eventually, shown, to, be, trnas, and, the, catalytic, ribonucleic, protein, complexes, became, known, as, ribosomes, an, important, step, was, the, realisation, by, crick, and, brenner, on, 15, april, 1960, during, a, conversation, with, fran, ois, jacob, that, messenger, rna, was, not, the, same, thing, as, ribosomal, rna, later, that, summer, brenner, jacob, and, matthew, meselson, conducted, an, experiment, which, was, the, first, to, prove, the, existence, of, messenger, rna, none, of, this, however, answered, the, fundamental, theoretical, question, of, the, exact, nature, of, the, genetic, code, in, his, 1958, article, crick, speculated, as, had, others, that, a, triplet, of, nucleotides, could, code, for, an, amino, acid, such, a, code, might, be, degenerate, with, 4, 4, 4, 64, possible, triplets, of, the, four, nucleotide, subunits, while, there, were, only, 20, amino, acids, some, amino, acids, might, have, multiple, triplet, codes, crick, also, explored, other, codes, in, which, for, various, reasons, only, some, of, the, triplets, were, used, magically, producing, just, the, 20, needed, combinations, experimental, results, were, needed, theory, alone, could, not, decide, the, nature, of, the, code, crick, also, used, the, term, central, dogma, to, summarise, an, idea, that, implies, that, genetic, information, flow, between, macromolecules, would, be, essentially, one, way, some, critics, thought, that, by, using, the, word, dogma, crick, was, implying, that, this, was, a, rule, that, could, not, be, questioned, but, all, he, really, meant, was, that, it, was, a, compelling, idea, without, much, solid, evidence, to, support, it, in, his, thinking, about, the, biological, processes, linking, dna, genes, to, proteins, crick, made, explicit, the, distinction, between, the, materials, involved, the, energy, required, and, the, information, flow, crick, was, focused, on, this, third, component, information, and, it, became, the, organising, principle, of, what, became, known, as, molecular, biology, crick, had, by, this, time, become, a, highly, influential, theoretical, molecular, biologist, proof, that, the, genetic, code, is, a, degenerate, triplet, code, finally, came, from, genetics, experiments, some, of, which, were, performed, by, crick, the, details, of, the, code, came, mostly, from, work, by, marshall, nirenberg, and, others, who, synthesized, synthetic, rna, molecules, and, used, them, as, templates, for, in, vitro, protein, synthesis, nirenberg, first, announced, his, results, to, a, small, audience, in, moscow, at, a, 1961, conference, crick, s, reaction, was, to, invite, nirenberg, to, deliver, his, talk, to, a, larger, audience, watson, and, crick, s, use, of, dna, x, ray, diffraction, data, collected, by, franklin, and, wilkins, has, generated, an, enduring, controversy, it, arose, from, the, fact, that, some, of, franklin, s, unpublished, data, were, used, without, her, knowledge, or, consent, by, watson, and, crick, in, their, construction, of, the, double, helix, model, of, dna, of, the, four, dna, researchers, only, franklin, had, a, degree, in, chemistry, wilkins, and, crick, had, backgrounds, in, physics, watson, in, biology, prior, to, publication, of, the, double, helix, structure, watson, and, crick, had, little, direct, interaction, with, franklin, herself, they, were, however, aware, of, her, work, more, aware, than, she, herself, realised, watson, was, present, at, a, lecture, given, in, november, 1951, where, franklin, presented, the, two, forms, of, the, molecule, type, a, and, type, b, and, discussed, the, position, of, the, phosphate, units, on, the, external, part, of, the, molecule, in, january, 1953, watson, was, shown, an, x, ray, photograph, of, b, dna, called, photograph, 51, by, wilkins, wilkins, had, been, given, photograph, 51, by, rosalind, franklin, s, phd, student, raymond, gosling, wilkins, and, gosling, had, worked, together, in, the, medical, research, council, s, mrc, biophysics, unit, before, director, john, randall, appointed, franklin, to, take, over, both, dna, diffraction, work, and, guidance, of, gosling, s, thesis, it, appears, that, randall, did, not, communicate, effectively, with, them, about, franklin, s, appointment, contributing, to, confusion, and, friction, between, wilkins, and, franklin, in, the, middle, of, february, 1953, crick, s, thesis, advisor, max, perutz, gave, crick, a, copy, of, a, report, written, for, a, medical, research, council, biophysics, committee, visit, to, king, s, in, december, 1952, containing, data, from, the, king, s, group, including, some, of, franklin, s, crystallographic, calculations, franklin, was, unaware, that, photograph, 51, and, other, information, had, been, shared, with, crick, and, watson, she, wrote, a, series, of, three, draft, manuscripts, two, of, which, included, a, double, helical, dna, backbone, her, two, manuscripts, on, form, a, dna, reached, acta, crystallographica, in, copenhagen, on, march, 6, 1953, one, day, before, crick, and, watson, had, completed, their, model, the, x, ray, diffraction, images, collected, by, gosling, and, franklin, provided, the, best, evidence, for, the, helical, nature, of, dna, before, this, both, linus, pauling, watson, and, crick, had, generated, erroneous, models, with, the, chains, inside, and, the, bases, pointing, outwards, her, experimental, results, provided, estimates, of, the, water, content, of, dna, crystals, and, these, results, were, most, consistent, with, the, three, sugar, phosphate, backbones, being, on, the, outside, of, the, molecule, franklin, s, x, ray, photograph, showed, that, the, backbones, had, to, be, on, the, outside, although, she, at, first, insisted, vehemently, that, her, data, did, not, force, one, to, conclude, that, dna, has, a, helical, structure, in, the, drafts, she, submitted, in, 1953, she, argues, for, a, double, helical, dna, backbone, building, on, her, manuscripts, she, discovered, that, form, a, dna, had, antiparallel, backbones, which, supported, the, double, helical, structure, of, dna, she, did, this, through, identification, of, the, space, group, for, dna, crystals, this, would, go, to, help, watson, and, crick, decide, to, look, for, dna, models, with, two, antiparallel, polynucleotide, strands, in, summary, watson, and, crick, had, three, sources, for, franklin, s, unpublished, data, 1, her, 1951, seminar, attended, by, watson, 2, discussions, with, wilkins, who, worked, in, the, same, laboratory, with, franklin, 3, a, research, progress, report, that, was, intended, to, promote, coordination, of, medical, research, council, supported, laboratories, watson, crick, wilkins, and, franklin, all, worked, in, mrc, laboratories, crick, and, watson, felt, that, they, had, benefited, from, collaborating, with, wilkins, they, offered, him, a, co, authorship, on, the, article, that, first, described, the, double, helix, structure, of, dna, wilkins, turned, down, the, offer, a, fact, that, may, have, led, to, the, terse, character, of, the, acknowledgement, of, experimental, work, done, at, king, s, college, in, the, eventual, published, paper, rather, than, make, any, of, the, dna, researchers, at, king, s, college, co, authors, on, the, watson, and, crick, double, helix, article, the, solution, that, was, arrived, at, was, to, publish, two, additional, papers, from, king, s, college, along, with, the, helix, paper, brenda, maddox, suggests, that, because, of, the, importance, of, her, experimental, results, in, watson, and, crick, s, model, building, and, theoretical, analysis, franklin, should, have, had, her, name, on, the, original, watson, and, crick, paper, in, nature, franklin, and, gosling, submitted, their, own, joint, second, paper, to, nature, at, the, same, time, as, wilkins, stokes, and, wilson, submitted, theirs, i, e, the, third, paper, on, dna, watson, s, portrayal, of, franklin, in, the, double, helix, was, negative, and, gave, the, appearance, that, she, was, wilkins, assistant, and, was, unable, to, interpret, her, own, dna, data, however, according, to, nathaniel, comfort, a, historian, of, medicine, at, johns, hopkins, university, franklin, s, colleague, aaron, klug, believed, that, franklin, was, two, steps, away, from, the, double, helix, after, completing, an, analysis, of, her, lab, notebook, klug, stated, that, she, surely, would, have, had, it, the, x, ray, diffraction, images, collected, by, franklin, provided, the, best, evidence, for, the, helical, nature, of, dna, while, franklin, s, experimental, work, proved, important, to, crick, and, watson, s, development, of, a, correct, model, she, herself, could, not, realize, it, at, the, time, when, she, left, king, s, college, director, sir, john, randall, insisted, that, all, dna, work, belonged, exclusively, to, king, s, and, ordered, franklin, to, not, even, think, about, it, because, of, this, the, scientific, community, did, not, understand, the, depth, of, franklin, s, contributions, franklin, subsequently, did, superb, work, in, j, d, bernal, s, lab, at, birkbeck, college, with, the, tobacco, mosaic, virus, which, also, extended, ideas, on, helical, construction, crick, occasionally, expressed, his, views, on, eugenics, usually, in, private, letters, for, example, crick, advocated, a, form, of, positive, eugenics, in, which, wealthy, parents, would, be, encouraged, to, have, more, children, he, once, remarked, in, the, long, run, it, is, unavoidable, that, society, will, begin, to, worry, about, the, character, of, the, next, generation, it, is, not, a, subject, at, the, moment, which, we, can, tackle, easily, because, people, have, so, many, religious, beliefs, and, until, we, have, a, more, uniform, view, of, ourselves, i, think, it, would, be, risky, to, try, and, do, anything, in, the, way, of, eugenics, i, would, be, astonished, if, in, the, next, 100, or, 200, years, society, did, not, come, round, to, the, view, that, they, would, have, to, try, to, improve, the, next, generation, in, some, extent, or, one, way, or, another, biologist, nancy, hopkins, says, when, she, was, an, undergraduate, in, the, 1960s, crick, put, his, hands, on, her, breasts, during, a, lab, visit, she, described, the, incident, before, i, could, rise, and, shake, hands, he, had, zoomed, across, the, room, stood, behind, me, put, his, hands, on, my, breasts, and, said, what, are, you, working, on, crick, referred, to, himself, as, a, humanist, which, he, defined, as, the, belief, that, human, problems, can, and, must, be, faced, in, terms, of, human, moral, and, intellectual, resources, without, invoking, supernatural, authority, he, publicly, called, for, humanism, to, replace, religion, as, a, guiding, force, for, humanity, writing, the, human, dilemma, is, hardly, new, we, find, ourselves, through, no, wish, of, our, own, on, this, slowly, revolving, planet, in, an, obscure, corner, of, a, vast, universe, our, questioning, intelligence, will, not, let, us, live, in, cow, like, content, with, our, lot, we, have, a, deep, need, to, know, why, we, are, here, what, is, the, world, made, of, more, important, what, are, we, made, of, in, the, past, religion, answered, these, questions, often, in, considerable, detail, now, we, know, that, almost, all, these, answers, are, highly, likely, to, be, nonsense, having, sprung, from, man, s, ignorance, and, his, enormous, capacity, for, self, deception, the, simple, fables, of, the, religions, of, the, world, have, come, to, seem, like, tales, told, to, children, even, understood, symbolically, they, are, often, perverse, if, not, rather, unpleasant, humanists, then, live, in, a, mysterious, exciting, and, intellectually, expanding, world, which, once, glimpsed, makes, the, old, worlds, of, the, religions, seem, fake, cosy, and, stale, crick, was, especially, critical, of, christianity, i, do, not, respect, christian, beliefs, i, think, they, are, ridiculous, if, we, could, get, rid, of, them, we, could, more, easily, get, down, to, the, serious, problem, of, trying, to, find, out, what, the, world, is, all, about, crick, once, joked, christianity, may, be, ok, between, consenting, adults, in, private, but, should, not, be, taught, to, young, children, in, his, book, of, molecules, and, men, crick, expressed, his, views, on, the, relationship, between, science, and, religion, after, suggesting, that, it, would, become, possible, for, a, computer, to, be, programmed, so, as, to, have, a, soul, he, wondered, at, what, point, during, biological, evolution, did, the, first, organism, have, a, soul, at, what, moment, does, a, baby, get, a, soul, crick, stated, his, view, that, the, idea, of, a, non, material, soul, that, could, enter, a, body, and, then, persist, after, death, is, just, that, an, imagined, idea, for, crick, the, mind, is, a, product, of, physical, brain, activity, and, the, brain, had, evolved, by, natural, means, over, millions, of, years, he, felt, that, it, was, important, that, evolution, by, natural, selection, be, taught, in, schools, and, that, it, was, regrettable, that, english, schools, had, compulsory, religious, instruction, he, also, considered, that, a, new, scientific, world, view, was, rapidly, being, established, and, predicted, that, once, the, detailed, workings, of, the, brain, were, eventually, revealed, erroneous, christian, concepts, about, the, nature, of, humans, and, the, world, would, no, longer, be, tenable, traditional, conceptions, of, the, soul, would, be, replaced, by, a, new, understanding, of, the, physical, basis, of, mind, he, was, sceptical, of, organised, religion, referring, to, himself, as, a, sceptic, and, an, agnostic, with, a, strong, inclination, towards, atheism, in, 1960, crick, accepted, an, honorary, fellowship, at, churchill, college, cambridge, one, factor, being, that, the, new, college, did, not, have, a, chapel, some, time, later, a, large, donation, was, made, to, establish, a, chapel, and, the, college, council, decided, to, accept, it, crick, resigned, his, fellowship, in, protest, in, october, 1969, crick, participated, in, a, celebration, of, the, 100th, year, of, the, journal, nature, in, which, he, attempted, to, make, some, predictions, about, what, the, next, 30, years, would, hold, for, molecular, biology, his, speculations, were, later, published, in, nature, near, the, end, of, the, article, crick, briefly, mentioned, the, search, for, life, on, other, planets, but, he, held, little, hope, that, extraterrestrial, life, would, be, found, by, the, year, 2000, he, also, discussed, what, he, described, as, a, possible, new, direction, for, research, what, he, called, biochemical, theology, crick, wrote, so, many, people, pray, that, one, finds, it, hard, to, believe, that, they, do, not, get, some, satisfaction, from, it, crick, suggested, that, it, might, be, possible, to, find, chemical, changes, in, the, brain, that, were, molecular, correlates, of, the, act, of, prayer, he, speculated, that, there, might, be, a, detectable, change, in, the, level, of, some, neurotransmitter, or, neurohormone, when, people, pray, he, might, have, been, imagining, substances, such, as, dopamine, that, are, released, by, the, brain, under, certain, conditions, and, produce, rewarding, sensations, crick, s, suggestion, that, there, might, someday, be, a, new, science, of, biochemical, theology, seems, to, have, been, realised, under, an, alternative, name, there, is, now, the, new, field, of, neurotheology, crick, s, view, of, the, relationship, between, science, and, religion, continued, to, play, a, role, in, his, work, as, he, made, the, transition, from, molecular, biology, research, into, theoretical, neuroscience, crick, asked, in, 1998, and, if, some, of, the, bible, is, manifestly, wrong, why, should, any, of, the, rest, of, it, be, accepted, automatically, and, what, would, be, more, important, than, to, find, our, true, place, in, the, universe, by, removing, one, by, one, these, unfortunate, vestiges, of, earlier, beliefs, in, 2003, he, was, one, of, 22, nobel, laureates, who, signed, the, humanist, manifesto, crick, was, a, firm, critic, of, young, earth, creationism, in, the, 1987, united, states, supreme, court, case, edwards, v, aguillard, crick, joined, a, group, of, other, nobel, laureates, who, advised, creation, science, simply, has, no, place, in, the, public, school, science, classroom, crick, was, also, an, advocate, for, the, establishment, of, darwin, day, as, a, british, national, holiday, during, the, 1960s, crick, became, concerned, with, the, origins, of, the, genetic, code, in, 1966, crick, took, the, place, of, leslie, orgel, at, a, meeting, where, orgel, was, to, talk, about, the, origin, of, life, crick, speculated, about, possible, stages, by, which, an, initially, simple, code, with, a, few, amino, acid, types, might, have, evolved, into, the, more, complex, code, used, by, existing, organisms, at, that, time, proteins, were, thought, to, be, the, only, kind, of, enzyme, and, ribozymes, had, not, yet, been, identified, many, molecular, biologists, were, puzzled, by, the, problem, of, the, origin, of, a, protein, replicating, system, that, is, as, complex, as, that, which, exists, in, organisms, currently, inhabiting, earth, in, the, early, 1970s, crick, and, orgel, further, speculated, about, the, possibility, that, the, production, of, living, systems, from, molecules, may, have, been, a, very, rare, event, in, the, universe, but, once, it, had, developed, it, could, be, spread, by, intelligent, life, forms, using, space, travel, technology, a, process, they, called, directed, panspermia, in, a, retrospective, article, crick, and, orgel, noted, that, they, had, been, unduly, pessimistic, about, the, chances, of, abiogenesis, on, earth, when, they, had, assumed, that, some, kind, of, self, replicating, protein, system, was, the, molecular, origin, of, life, in, 1976, crick, addressed, the, origin, of, protein, synthesis, in, a, paper, with, sydney, brenner, aaron, klug, and, george, pieczenik, in, this, paper, they, speculate, that, code, constraints, on, nucleotide, sequences, allow, protein, synthesis, without, the, need, for, a, ribosome, it, however, requires, a, five, base, binding, between, the, mrna, and, trna, with, a, flip, of, the, anti, codon, creating, a, triplet, coding, even, though, it, is, a, five, base, physical, interaction, thomas, h, jukes, pointed, out, that, the, code, constraints, on, the, mrna, sequence, required, for, this, translation, mechanism, is, still, preserved, crick, s, period, at, cambridge, was, the, pinnacle, of, his, long, scientific, career, but, he, left, cambridge, in, 1977, after, 30, years, having, been, offered, and, having, refused, the, mastership, of, gonville, and, caius, james, watson, claimed, at, a, cambridge, conference, marking, the, 50th, anniversary, of, the, discovery, of, the, structure, of, dna, in, 2003, now, perhaps, it, s, a, pretty, well, kept, secret, that, one, of, the, most, uninspiring, acts, of, the, university, of, cambridge, over, this, past, century, was, to, turn, down, francis, crick, when, he, applied, to, be, the, professor, of, genetics, in, 1958, now, there, may, have, been, a, series, of, arguments, which, led, them, to, reject, francis, it, was, really, saying, don, t, push, us, to, the, frontier, the, apparently, pretty, well, kept, secret, had, already, been, recorded, in, soraya, de, chadarevian, s, designs, for, life, molecular, biology, after, world, war, ii, published, by, cambridge, university, press, in, 2002, his, major, contribution, to, molecular, biology, in, cambridge, is, well, documented, in, the, history, of, the, university, of, cambridge, volume, 4, 1870, to, 1990, which, was, published, by, cup, in, 1992, according, to, the, university, of, cambridge, s, genetics, department, official, website, the, electors, of, the, professorship, could, not, reach, consensus, prompting, the, intervention, of, then, university, vice, chancellor, lord, adrian, lord, adrian, first, offered, the, professorship, to, a, compromise, candidate, guido, pontecorvo, who, refused, and, is, said, to, have, offered, it, then, to, crick, who, also, refused, in, 1976, crick, took, a, sabbatical, year, at, the, salk, institute, for, biological, studies, in, la, jolla, california, crick, had, been, a, nonresident, fellow, of, the, institute, since, 1960, crick, wrote, i, felt, at, home, in, southern, california, after, the, sabbatical, crick, left, cambridge, to, continue, working, at, the, salk, institute, he, was, also, an, adjunct, professor, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, he, taught, himself, neuroanatomy, and, studied, many, other, areas, of, neuroscience, research, it, took, him, several, years, to, disengage, from, molecular, biology, because, exciting, discoveries, continued, to, be, made, including, the, discovery, of, alternative, splicing, and, the, discovery, of, restriction, enzymes, which, helped, make, possible, genetic, engineering, eventually, in, the, 1980s, crick, was, able, to, devote, his, full, attention, to, his, other, interest, consciousness, his, autobiographical, book, what, mad, pursuit, a, personal, view, of, scientific, discovery, includes, a, description, of, why, he, left, molecular, biology, and, switched, to, neuroscience, upon, taking, up, work, in, theoretical, neuroscience, crick, was, struck, by, several, things, crick, hoped, he, might, aid, progress, in, neuroscience, by, promoting, constructive, interactions, between, specialists, from, the, many, different, subdisciplines, concerned, with, consciousness, he, also, collaborated, with, neurophilosophers, such, as, patricia, churchland, in, 1983, as, a, result, of, their, studies, of, computer, models, of, neural, networks, crick, and, mitchison, proposed, that, the, function, of, rem, sleep, and, dreaming, is, to, remove, certain, modes, of, interactions, in, networks, of, cells, in, the, mammalian, cerebral, cortex, they, called, this, hypothetical, process, reverse, learning, or, unlearning, in, the, final, phase, of, his, career, crick, established, a, collaboration, with, christof, koch, that, led, to, publication, of, a, series, of, articles, on, consciousness, during, the, period, spanning, from, 1990, to, 2005, crick, made, the, strategic, decision, to, focus, his, theoretical, investigation, of, consciousness, on, how, the, brain, generates, visual, awareness, within, a, few, hundred, milliseconds, of, viewing, a, scene, crick, and, koch, proposed, that, consciousness, seems, so, mysterious, because, it, involves, very, short, term, memory, processes, that, are, as, yet, poorly, understood, in, his, book, the, astonishing, hypothesis, crick, described, how, neurobiology, had, reached, a, mature, enough, stage, so, that, consciousness, could, be, the, subject, of, a, unified, effort, to, study, it, at, the, molecular, cellular, and, behavioural, levels, crick, was, sceptical, about, the, value, of, computational, models, of, mental, function, that, are, not, based, on, details, about, brain, structure, and, function, crick, was, aware, that, research, on, consciousness, was, a, difficult, task, as, he, wrote, to, martynas, y, as, in, april, 1996, i, don, t, think, we, shall, fully, understand, consciousness, by, the, end, of, this, century, but, it, s, possible, we, can, get, a, glimpse, of, the, answer, by, then, whether, it, will, all, fall, into, place, as, molecular, biology, did, without, a, vital, force, or, whether, we, need, a, radical, formulation, only, time, will, tell, best, wishes, yours, francis, p, s, by, the, way, i, ve, not, been, knighted, in, addition, to, his, third, share, of, the, 1962, nobel, prize, for, physiology, or, medicine, he, received, many, awards, and, honours, including, the, royal, and, copley, medals, of, the, royal, society, 1972, and, 1975, and, also, the, order, of, merit, on, 27, november, 1991, he, refused, an, offer, of, a, cbe, in, 1963, but, was, often, referred, to, in, error, as, sir, francis, crick, and, even, on, occasions, as, lord, crick, he, was, elected, an, embo, member, in, 1964, the, award, of, nobel, prizes, to, john, kendrew, and, max, perutz, and, to, crick, watson, and, wilkins, was, satirised, in, a, short, sketch, in, the, bbc, tv, programme, that, was, the, week, that, was, with, the, nobel, prizes, being, referred, to, as, the, alfred, nobel, peace, pools, he, was, an, elected, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, 1962, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, 1969, and, the, american, philosophical, society, 1972, the, francis, crick, medal, and, lecture, was, established, in, 2003, following, an, endowment, by, his, former, colleague, sydney, brenner, joint, winner, of, the, 2002, nobel, prize, in, physiology, and, medicine, the, lecture, is, delivered, annually, in, any, field, of, biological, sciences, with, preference, given, to, the, areas, in, which, francis, crick, himself, worked, importantly, the, lectureship, is, aimed, at, younger, scientists, ideally, under, 40, or, whose, career, progression, corresponds, to, this, age, as, of, 2019, crick, lectures, have, been, delivered, by, julie, ahringer, dario, alessi, ewan, birney, simon, boulton, jason, chin, simon, fisher, matthew, hurles, gilean, mcvean, duncan, odom, geraint, rees, sarah, teichmann, m, madan, babu, and, daniel, wolpert, the, francis, crick, institute, is, a, 660, million, biomedical, research, centre, located, in, north, london, united, kingdom, the, francis, crick, institute, is, a, partnership, between, cancer, research, uk, imperial, college, london, king, s, college, london, the, medical, research, council, university, college, london, ucl, and, the, wellcome, trust, completed, in, 2016, it, is, the, largest, centre, for, biomedical, research, and, innovation, in, europe, the, university, of, cambridge, graduate, school, of, biological, medical, and, veterinary, sciences, hosts, the, francis, crick, graduate, lectures, the, first, two, lectures, were, by, john, gurdon, and, tim, hunt, crick, papers, audio, and, video, files, about, his, work,
