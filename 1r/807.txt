until, 1890, he, is, also, known, for, his, theories, of, geographical, sectionalism, during, recent, years, historians, and, academics, have, argued, frequently, over, turner, s, work, however, all,

adams, turner, did, not, publish, extensively, his, influence, came, from, tersely, expressed, interpretive, theories, in, his, articles, which, influenced, his, hundreds, of, disciples, two, theories, in, particular, were, influential, the, frontier, thesis, and, the, sectional, hypothesis, although, he, published, little, he, had, an, encyclopedic, knowledge, of, american, history, earning, a, reputation, by, 1910, as, one, of, the, two, or, three, most, influential, historians, in, the, country, he, proved, adept, at, promoting, his, ideas, and, his, students, for, whom, he, obtained, jobs, in, major, universities, including, merle, curti, and, marcus, lee, hansen, he, circulated, copies, of, his, essays, and, lectures, to, important, scholars, and, literary, people, published, extensively, in, magazines, recycled, favorite, material, attaining, the, largest, possible, audience, for, major, concepts, and, wielded, considerable, influence, within, the, american, historical, association, as, an, officer, and, advisor, for, the, american, historical, review, his, emphasis, on, the, importance, of, the, frontier, in, shaping, american, character, influenced, the, interpretation, found, in, thousands, of, scholarly, histories, by, the, time, turner, died, in, 1932, 60, of, the, major, history, departments, in, the, u, s, were, teaching, courses, in, frontier, history, compatible, with, turner, s, theories, annoyed, by, the, university, regents, who, demanded, less, research, and, more, teaching, and, state, service, turner, sought, an, environment, that, would, permit, him, to, do, more, research, declining, offers, from, the, university, of, california, he, accepted, an, offer, from, harvard, university, in, 1910, and, remained, a, professor, there, until, 1922, being, succeeded, in, 1924, by, arthur, m, schlesinger, sr, in, 1907, turner, was, elected, a, member, of, the, american, antiquarian, society, and, in, 1911, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, turner, was, never, comfortable, at, harvard, when, he, retired, in, 1922, he, became, a, visiting, scholar, at, the, huntington, library, in, los, angeles, where, his, note, cards, and, files, continued, to, accumulate, although, few, monographs, got, published, his, the, frontier, in, american, history, 1920, was, a, collection, of, older, essays, as, a, professor, of, history, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, from, 1890, to, 1910, and, harvard, from, 1910, to, 1922, turner, trained, scores, of, disciples, who, in, turn, dominated, american, history, programs, throughout, the, country, his, model, of, sectionalism, as, a, composite, of, social, forces, such, as, ethnicity, and, land, ownership, encouraged, historians, to, use, social, history, to, analyze, social, economic, and, political, developments, of, american, history, at, the, american, historical, association, he, collaborated, with, j, franklin, jameson, on, numerous, major, projects, turner, s, theories, became, unfashionable, during, the, 1960s, as, critics, complained, that, he, neglected, regionalism, they, complained, that, he, claimed, too, much, egalitarianism, and, democracy, for, a, frontier, that, was, restrictive, for, women, and, minorities, after, turner, s, death, his, former, colleague, isaiah, bowman, had, this, to, say, of, his, work, turner, s, ideas, were, curiously, wanting, in, evidence, from, field, studies, he, represents, a, type, of, historian, who, rests, his, case, on, documents, and, general, impression, rather, than, a, scientist, who, goes, out, for, to, see, his, ideas, were, never, forgotten, indeed, they, influenced, the, new, field, of, environmental, history, turner, gave, a, strong, impetus, to, quantitative, methods, and, scholars, using, new, statistical, techniques, and, data, sets, have, for, example, confirmed, many, of, turner, s, suggestions, about, population, movements, turner, believed, that, because, of, his, own, biases, and, the, amount, of, conflicting, historical, evidence, that, any, one, method, of, historical, interpretation, would, be, insufficient, that, an, interdisciplinary, method, was, the, most, accurate, way, to, analyze, history, turner, s, frontier, thesis, was, developed, in, a, scholarly, paper, of, 1893, the, significance, of, the, frontier, in, american, history, read, before, the, american, historical, association, in, chicago, during, the, world, s, columbian, exposition, chicago, world, s, fair, he, believed, the, spirit, and, success, of, the, united, states, was, associated, directly, with, the, country, s, westward, expansion, turner, expounded, an, evolutionary, model, he, had, been, influenced, by, work, with, geologists, at, wisconsin, the, west, not, the, east, was, where, distinctively, american, characteristics, emerged, the, creation, of, the, unique, american, identity, occurred, at, the, juncture, between, the, civilization, of, settlement, and, the, savagery, of, wilderness, this, produced, a, new, type, of, citizen, one, with, the, power, to, tame, the, wild, and, one, upon, whom, the, wild, had, conferred, strength, and, individuality, as, each, generation, of, pioneers, relocated, 50, to, 100, miles, west, they, abandoned, useless, european, practices, institutions, and, ideas, and, instead, found, new, solutions, to, new, problems, created, by, their, new, environment, over, multiple, generations, the, frontier, produced, characteristics, of, informality, violence, crudeness, democracy, and, initiative, that, the, world, recognized, as, american, turner, ignored, gender, and, he, did, not, emphasize, class, historians, of, the, 1960s, and, later, stressed, that, race, class, and, gender, were, major, influencers, of, history, the, new, generation, stresses, gender, ethnicity, professional, categorization, and, the, contrasting, victor, and, victim, legacies, of, manifest, destiny, and, colonial, expansion, most, professional, historians, operating, within, the, au, courant, postmodern, paradigm, now, criticize, turner, s, frontier, thesis, and, the, theme, of, american, exceptionalism, the, disunity, of, the, concept, of, the, west, and, the, similarity, of, american, expansion, to, european, colonialism, and, imperialism, during, the, 19th, century, and, the, lack, of, complete, egalitarianism, even, on, the, frontier, revealed, the, limits, of, turnerian, and, exceptionalist, paradigms, turner, s, sectionalism, essays, are, collected, in, the, significance, of, sections, in, american, history, which, won, the, pulitzer, prize, in, history, in, 1933, turner, s, sectionalism, thesis, had, almost, as, much, influence, among, historians, as, his, frontier, thesis, but, never, became, widely, known, to, the, general, public, as, did, the, frontier, thesis, he, argued, that, different, ethnocultural, groups, had, distinct, settlement, patterns, and, this, revealed, itself, in, politics, economics, and, society, turner, s, ideas, influenced, many, types, of, historiography, concerning, the, history, of, religion, for, example, boles, 1993, notes, that, william, warren, sweet, at, the, university, of, chicago, divinity, school, argued, that, churches, adapted, to, the, characteristics, of, the, frontier, creating, new, denominations, such, as, the, lds, church, the, church, of, christ, the, disciples, of, christ, and, the, cumberland, presbyterians, the, frontier, they, argued, created, uniquely, american, institutions, such, as, revivals, camp, meetings, and, itinerant, preaching, this, opinion, dominated, religious, historiography, for, decades, moos, 2002, says, that, the, 1910s, to, 1940s, black, filmmaker, and, novelist, oscar, micheaux, incorporated, turner, s, frontier, thesis, into, his, work, micheaux, promoted, the, west, as, a, place, where, blacks, could, transcend, race, and, earn, economic, success, through, diligent, work, and, perseverance, citing, turner, s, frontier, thesis, friedrich, ratzel, believed, that, the, german, campaign, to, colonize, german, south, west, africa, could, serve, to, harden, the, german, character, slatta, 2001, maintains, that, the, widespread, popularization, of, turner, s, frontier, thesis, influenced, popular, histories, motion, pictures, and, novels, which, characterize, the, west, in, terms, of, individualism, frontier, violence, and, rough, justice, disneyland, s, frontierland, of, the, late, 20th, century, represented, the, myth, of, rugged, individualism, that, celebrated, what, was, perceived, to, be, the, american, heritage, the, public, has, ignored, academic, historians, david, j, weber, for, example, anti, turnerian, models, largely, because, they, conflict, with, and, often, destroy, the, legends, of, western, heritage, however, the, work, of, historians, during, the, 1980s, 1990s, some, of, whom, sought, to, discredit, turner, s, conception, of, the, frontier, and, others, who, have, sought, to, spare, the, concept, while, presenting, a, more, balanced, and, nuanced, version, of, it, have, done, much, to, place, western, myths, in, context, the, frederick, jackson, turner, award, is, given, annually, by, the, organization, of, american, historians, for, an, author, s, first, scholarly, book, on, american, history, turner, s, former, home, in, madison, wisconsin, is, located, in, what, is, now, the, langdon, street, historic, district, in, 2009, he, was, inducted, into, the, hall, of, great, westerners, of, the, national, cowboy, western, heritage, museum, turner, married, caroline, mae, sherwood, in, chicago, in, november, 1889, they, had, three, children, only, one, survived, childhood, dorothy, kinsley, turner, later, main, was, the, mother, of, the, historian, jackson, turner, main, 1917, 2003, a, scholar, of, revolutionary, america, who, married, a, fellow, scholar, frederick, jackson, turner, died, in, 1932, in, pasadena, california, where, he, had, been, a, research, associate, at, the, huntington, library
