gustav, mahler, german, 7, july, 1860, 18, may, 1911, was, an, austro, bohemian, romantic, composer, and, one, of, the, leading, conductors, of, his, generation, as, a, composer, he, acted, as, a, bridge, between, the, 19th, century, austro, german, tradition, and, the, modernism, of, the, early, 20th, century, while, in, his, lifetime, his, status, as, a, conductor, was, established, beyond, question, his, own, music, gained, wide, popularity, only, after, periods, of, relative, neglect, which, included, a, ban, on, its, performance, in, much, of, europe, during, the, nazi, era, after, 1945, his, compositions, were, rediscovered, by, a, new, generation, of, listeners, mahler, then, became, one, of, the, most, frequently, performed, and, recorded, of, all, composers, a, position, he, has, sustained, into, the, 21st, century, born, in, bohemia, then, part, of, the, austrian, empire, to, jewish, parents, of, humble, origins, the, german, speaking, mahler, displayed, his, musical, gifts, at, an, early, age, after, graduating, from, the, vienna, conservatory, in, 1878, he, held, a, succession, of, conducting, posts, of, rising, importance, in, the, opera, houses, of, europe, culminating, in, his, appointment, in, 1897, as, director, of, the, vienna, court, opera, hofoper, during, his, ten, years, in, vienna, mahler, who, had, converted, to, catholicism, to, secure, the, post, experienced, regular, opposition, and, hostility, from, the, anti, semitic, press, nevertheless, his, innovative, productions, and, insistence, on, the, highest, performance, standards, ensured, his, reputation, as, one, of, the, greatest, of, opera, conductors, particularly, as, an, interpreter, of, the, stage, works, of, wagner, mozart, and, tchaikovsky, late, in, his, life, he, was, briefly, director, of, new, york, s, metropolitan, opera, and, the, new, york, philharmonic, mahler, s, uvre, is, relatively, limited, for, much, of, his, life, composing, was, necessarily, a, part, time, activity, while, he, earned, his, living, as, a, conductor, aside, from, early, works, such, as, a, movement, from, a, piano, quartet, composed, when, he, was, a, student, in, vienna, mahler, s, works, are, generally, designed, for, large, orchestral, forces, symphonic, choruses, and, operatic, soloists, these, works, were, frequently, controversial, when, first, performed, and, several, were, slow, to, receive, critical, and, popular, approval, exceptions, included, his, second, symphony, and, the, triumphant, premiere, of, his, eighth, symphony, in, 1910, some, of, mahler, s, immediate, musical, successors, included, the, composers, of, the, second, viennese, school, notably, arnold, schoenberg, alban, berg, and, anton, webern, dmitri, shostakovich, and, benjamin, britten, are, among, later, 20th, century, composers, who, admired, and, were, influenced, by, mahler, the, international, gustav, mahler, society, was, established, in, 1955, to, honour, the, composer, s, life, and, achievements, the, mahler, family, came, from, eastern, bohemia, now, in, the, czech, republic, and, were, of, humble, circumstances, the, composer, s, grandmother, had, been, a, street, pedlar, bohemia, was, then, part, of, the, austrian, empire, the, mahler, family, belonged, to, a, german, speaking, minority, among, bohemians, and, was, also, jewish, from, this, background, the, future, composer, developed, early, on, a, permanent, sense, of, exile, always, an, intruder, never, welcomed, the, pedlar, s, son, bernhard, mahler, the, composer, s, father, elevated, himself, to, the, ranks, of, the, petite, bourgeoisie, by, becoming, a, coachman, and, later, an, innkeeper, he, bought, a, modest, house, in, the, village, of, kali, t, german, kalischt, and, in, 1857, married, marie, herrmann, the, 19, year, old, daughter, of, a, local, soap, manufacturer, in, the, following, year, marie, gave, birth, to, the, first, of, the, couple, s, 14, children, a, son, named, isidor, who, died, in, infancy, two, years, later, on, 7, july, 1860, their, second, son, gustav, was, born, in, december, 1860, bernhard, mahler, moved, with, his, wife, and, infant, son, to, the, city, of, jihlava, german, iglau, where, bernhard, built, up, a, successful, distillery, and, tavern, business, the, family, grew, rapidly, but, of, the, 12, children, born, to, the, family, in, the, city, only, six, survived, infancy, jihlava, was, then, a, thriving, commercial, city, of, 20, 000, people, in, which, gustav, was, introduced, to, music, through, the, street, songs, of, the, day, through, dance, tunes, folk, melodies, and, the, trumpet, calls, and, marches, of, the, local, military, band, all, of, these, elements, would, later, contribute, to, his, mature, musical, vocabulary, when, he, was, four, years, old, gustav, discovered, his, grandparents, piano, and, took, to, it, immediately, he, developed, his, performing, skills, sufficiently, to, be, considered, a, local, wunderkind, and, gave, his, first, public, performance, at, the, town, theatre, when, he, was, ten, years, old, although, gustav, loved, making, music, his, school, reports, from, the, jihlava, gymnasium, portrayed, him, as, absent, minded, and, unreliable, in, academic, work, in, 1871, in, the, hope, of, improving, the, boy, s, results, his, father, sent, him, to, the, new, town, gymnasium, in, prague, but, gustav, was, unhappy, there, and, soon, returned, to, jihlava, on, 13, april, 1875, he, suffered, a, bitter, personal, loss, when, his, younger, brother, ernst, b, 18, march, 1862, died, after, a, long, illness, mahler, sought, to, express, his, feelings, in, music, with, the, help, of, a, friend, josef, steiner, he, began, work, on, an, opera, herzog, ernst, von, schwaben, duke, ernest, of, swabia, as, a, memorial, to, his, lost, brother, neither, the, music, nor, the, libretto, of, this, work, has, survived, bernhard, mahler, supported, his, son, s, ambitions, for, a, music, career, and, agreed, that, the, boy, should, try, for, a, place, at, the, vienna, conservatory, the, young, mahler, was, auditioned, by, the, renowned, pianist, julius, epstein, and, accepted, for, 1875, 76, he, made, good, progress, in, his, piano, studies, with, epstein, and, won, prizes, at, the, end, of, each, of, his, first, two, years, for, his, final, year, 1877, 78, he, concentrated, on, composition, and, harmony, under, robert, fuchs, and, franz, krenn, few, of, mahler, s, student, compositions, have, survived, most, were, abandoned, when, he, became, dissatisfied, with, them, he, destroyed, a, symphonic, movement, prepared, for, an, end, of, term, competition, after, its, scornful, rejection, by, the, autocratic, director, joseph, hellmesberger, on, the, grounds, of, copying, errors, mahler, may, have, gained, his, first, conducting, experience, with, the, conservatory, s, student, orchestra, in, rehearsals, and, performances, although, it, appears, that, his, main, role, in, this, orchestra, was, as, a, percussionist, among, mahler, s, fellow, students, at, the, conservatory, was, the, future, song, composer, hugo, wolf, with, whom, he, formed, a, close, friendship, wolf, was, unable, to, submit, to, the, strict, disciplines, of, the, conservatory, and, was, expelled, mahler, while, sometimes, rebellious, avoided, the, same, fate, only, by, writing, a, penitent, letter, to, hellmesberger, he, attended, occasional, lectures, by, anton, bruckner, and, though, never, formally, his, pupil, was, influenced, by, him, on, 16, december, 1877, he, attended, the, disastrous, premiere, of, bruckner, s, third, symphony, at, which, the, composer, was, shouted, down, and, most, of, the, audience, walked, out, mahler, and, other, sympathetic, students, later, prepared, a, piano, version, of, the, symphony, which, they, presented, to, bruckner, along, with, many, music, students, of, his, generation, mahler, fell, under, the, spell, of, richard, wagner, though, his, chief, interest, was, the, sound, of, the, music, rather, than, the, staging, it, is, not, known, whether, he, saw, any, of, wagner, s, operas, during, his, student, years, mahler, left, the, conservatory, in, 1878, with, a, diploma, but, without, the, silver, medal, given, for, outstanding, achievement, he, then, enrolled, in, the, university, of, vienna, he, had, at, his, father, s, insistence, sat, and, with, difficulty, passed, the, matura, a, highly, demanding, final, exam, at, a, gymnasium, which, was, a, precondition, for, university, studies, and, followed, courses, which, reflected, his, developing, interests, in, literature, and, philosophy, after, leaving, the, university, in, 1879, mahler, made, some, money, as, a, piano, teacher, continued, to, compose, and, in, 1880, finished, a, dramatic, cantata, das, klagende, lied, the, song, of, lamentation, this, his, first, substantial, composition, shows, traces, of, wagnerian, and, brucknerian, influences, yet, includes, many, musical, elements, which, musicologist, deryck, cooke, describes, as, pure, mahler, its, first, performance, was, delayed, until, 1901, when, it, was, presented, in, a, revised, shortened, form, mahler, developed, interests, in, german, philosophy, and, was, introduced, by, his, friend, siegfried, lipiner, to, the, works, of, arthur, schopenhauer, friedrich, nietzsche, gustav, fechner, and, hermann, lotze, these, thinkers, continued, to, influence, mahler, and, his, music, long, after, his, student, days, were, over, mahler, s, biographer, jonathan, carr, says, that, the, composer, s, head, was, not, only, full, of, the, sound, of, bohemian, bands, trumpet, calls, and, marches, bruckner, chorales, and, schubert, sonatas, it, was, also, throbbing, with, the, problems, of, philosophy, and, metaphysics, he, had, thrashed, out, above, all, with, lipiner, from, june, to, august, 1880, mahler, took, his, first, professional, conducting, job, in, a, small, wooden, theatre, in, the, spa, town, of, bad, hall, south, of, linz, the, repertory, was, exclusively, operetta, it, was, in, carr, s, words, a, dismal, little, job, which, mahler, accepted, only, after, julius, epstein, told, him, he, would, soon, work, his, way, up, in, 1881, he, was, engaged, for, six, months, september, to, april, at, the, landestheater, in, laibach, now, ljubljana, in, slovenia, where, the, small, but, resourceful, company, was, prepared, to, attempt, more, ambitious, works, here, mahler, conducted, his, first, full, scale, opera, verdi, s, il, trovatore, one, of, 10, operas, and, a, number, of, operettas, that, he, presented, during, his, time, in, laibach, after, completing, this, engagement, mahler, returned, to, vienna, and, worked, part, time, as, chorus, master, at, the, vienna, carltheater, from, the, beginning, of, january, 1883, mahler, became, conductor, at, the, royal, municipal, theatre, in, olm, tz, now, olomouc, in, moravia, he, later, wrote, from, the, moment, i, crossed, the, threshold, of, the, olm, tz, theatre, i, felt, like, one, awaiting, the, wrath, of, god, despite, poor, relations, with, the, orchestra, mahler, brought, nine, operas, to, the, theatre, including, bizet, s, carmen, and, won, over, the, press, that, had, initially, been, sceptical, of, him, after, a, week, s, trial, at, the, royal, theatre, in, the, hessian, town, of, kassel, mahler, became, the, theatre, s, musical, and, choral, director, from, august, 1883, the, title, concealed, the, reality, that, mahler, was, subordinate, to, the, theatre, s, kapellmeister, wilhelm, treiber, who, disliked, him, and, vice, versa, and, set, out, to, make, his, life, miserable, despite, the, unpleasant, atmosphere, mahler, had, moments, of, success, at, kassel, he, directed, a, performance, of, his, favourite, opera, weber, s, der, freisch, tz, and, 25, other, operas, on, 23, june, 1884, he, conducted, his, own, incidental, music, to, joseph, victor, von, scheffel, s, play, der, trompeter, von, s, ckingen, the, trumpeter, of, s, ckingen, the, first, professional, public, performance, of, a, mahler, work, an, ardent, but, ultimately, unfulfilled, love, affair, with, soprano, johanna, richter, led, mahler, to, write, a, series, of, love, poems, which, became, the, text, of, his, song, cycle, lieder, eines, fahrenden, gesellen, songs, of, a, wayfarer, in, january, 1884, the, distinguished, conductor, hans, von, b, low, brought, the, meiningen, court, orchestra, to, kassel, and, gave, two, concerts, hoping, to, escape, from, his, job, in, the, theatre, mahler, unsuccessfully, sought, a, post, as, b, low, s, permanent, assistant, however, in, the, following, year, his, efforts, to, find, new, employment, resulted, in, a, six, year, contract, with, the, prestigious, leipzig, opera, to, begin, in, august, 1886, unwilling, to, remain, in, kassel, for, another, year, mahler, resigned, on, 22, june, 1885, and, applied, for, and, through, good, fortune, was, offered, a, standby, appointment, as, conductor, at, the, royal, neues, deutsches, theater, in, prague, by, the, theatre, s, newly, appointed, director, the, famous, angelo, neumann, in, prague, the, emergence, of, the, czech, national, revival, had, increased, the, popularity, and, importance, of, the, new, czech, national, theatre, and, had, led, to, a, downturn, in, the, neues, deutsches, theater, s, fortunes, mahler, s, task, was, to, help, arrest, this, decline, by, offering, high, quality, productions, of, german, opera, he, enjoyed, early, success, presenting, works, by, mozart, and, wagner, composers, with, whom, he, would, be, particularly, associated, for, the, rest, of, his, career, but, his, individualistic, and, increasingly, autocratic, conducting, style, led, to, friction, and, a, falling, out, with, his, more, experienced, fellow, conductor, ludwig, slansky, during, his, 12, months, in, prague, he, conducted, 68, performances, of, 14, operas, 12, titles, were, new, in, his, repertory, and, he, also, performed, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, by, the, end, of, the, season, in, july, 1886, mahler, left, prague, to, take, up, his, post, at, the, neues, stadttheater, in, leipzig, where, rivalry, with, his, senior, colleague, arthur, nikisch, began, almost, at, once, this, conflict, was, primarily, over, how, the, two, should, share, conducting, duties, for, the, theatre, s, new, production, of, wagner, s, ring, cycle, nikisch, s, illness, from, february, to, april, 1887, meant, that, mahler, took, charge, of, the, whole, cycle, except, g, tterd, mmerung, and, scored, a, resounding, public, success, this, did, not, however, win, him, popularity, with, the, orchestra, who, resented, his, dictatorial, manner, and, heavy, rehearsal, schedules, in, leipzig, mahler, befriended, captain, carl, von, weber, 1849, 1897, grandson, of, the, composer, and, agreed, to, prepare, a, performing, version, of, carl, maria, von, weber, s, unfinished, opera, die, drei, pintos, the, three, pintos, mahler, transcribed, and, orchestrated, the, existing, musical, sketches, used, parts, of, other, weber, works, and, added, some, composition, of, his, own, the, premiere, at, the, stadttheater, on, 20, january, 1888, was, an, important, occasion, at, which, several, heads, of, various, german, opera, houses, were, present, the, russian, composer, tchaikovsky, attended, the, third, performance, on, 29, january, the, work, was, well, received, its, success, did, much, to, raise, mahler, s, public, profile, and, brought, him, financial, rewards, mahler, s, involvement, with, the, weber, family, was, complicated, by, mahler, s, alleged, romantic, attachment, to, carl, von, weber, s, wife, marion, mathilde, 1857, 1931, which, though, intense, on, both, sides, so, it, was, rumoured, by, for, example, english, composer, ethel, smyth, ultimately, came, to, nothing, in, february, and, march, 1888, mahler, sketched, and, completed, his, first, symphony, then, in, five, movements, at, around, the, same, time, mahler, discovered, the, german, folk, poem, collection, des, knaben, wunderhorn, the, youth, s, magic, horn, which, would, dominate, much, of, his, compositional, output, for, the, following, 12, years, on, 17, may, 1888, mahler, suddenly, resigned, his, leipzig, position, after, a, dispute, with, the, stadttheater, s, chief, stage, manager, albert, goldberg, however, mahler, had, secretly, been, invited, by, angelo, neumann, in, prague, and, accepted, the, offer, to, conduct, the, premiere, there, of, his, die, drei, pintos, and, later, also, a, production, of, der, barbier, von, bagdad, by, peter, cornelius, this, short, stay, july, to, september, ended, unhappily, with, mahler, s, dismissal, following, his, outburst, during, a, rehearsal, however, through, the, efforts, of, an, old, viennese, friend, guido, adler, and, cellist, david, popper, mahler, s, name, went, forward, as, a, potential, director, of, the, royal, hungarian, opera, in, budapest, he, was, interviewed, made, a, good, impression, and, was, offered, and, accepted, with, some, reluctance, the, post, from, 1, october, 1888, in, the, early, years, of, mahler, s, conducting, career, composing, was, a, spare, time, activity, between, his, laibach, and, olm, tz, appointments, he, worked, on, settings, of, verses, by, richard, leander, and, tirso, de, molina, later, collected, as, volume, i, of, lieder, und, ges, nge, songs, and, airs, mahler, s, first, orchestral, song, cycle, lieder, eines, fahrenden, gesellen, composed, at, kassel, was, based, on, his, own, verses, although, the, first, poem, wenn, mein, schatz, hochzeit, macht, when, my, love, becomes, a, bride, closely, follows, the, text, of, a, wunderhorn, poem, the, melodies, for, the, second, and, fourth, songs, of, the, cycle, were, incorporated, into, the, first, symphony, which, mahler, finished, in, 1888, at, the, height, of, his, relationship, with, marion, von, weber, the, intensity, of, mahler, s, feelings, is, reflected, in, the, music, which, originally, was, written, as, a, five, movement, symphonic, poem, with, a, descriptive, programme, one, of, these, movements, the, blumine, later, discarded, was, based, on, a, passage, from, his, earlier, work, der, trompeter, von, s, ckingen, after, completing, the, symphony, mahler, composed, a, 20, minute, symphonic, poem, totenfeier, funeral, rites, which, later, became, the, first, movement, of, his, second, symphony, there, has, been, frequent, speculation, about, lost, or, destroyed, works, from, mahler, s, early, years, the, dutch, conductor, willem, mengelberg, believed, that, the, first, symphony, was, too, mature, to, be, a, first, symphonic, work, and, must, have, had, predecessors, in, 1938, mengelberg, revealed, the, existence, of, the, so, called, dresden, archive, a, series, of, manuscripts, in, the, possession, of, the, widowed, marion, von, weber, according, to, the, mahler, historian, donald, mitchell, it, was, highly, likely, that, important, mahler, manuscripts, of, early, symphonic, works, had, been, held, in, dresden, this, archive, if, it, existed, was, almost, certainly, destroyed, in, the, bombing, of, dresden, in, 1945, on, arriving, in, budapest, in, october, 1888, mahler, encountered, a, cultural, conflict, between, conservative, hungarian, nationalists, who, favoured, a, policy, of, magyarisation, and, progressives, who, wanted, to, maintain, and, develop, the, country, s, austro, german, cultural, traditions, in, the, opera, house, a, dominant, conservative, caucus, led, by, the, music, director, s, ndor, erkel, had, maintained, a, limited, repertory, of, historical, and, folklore, opera, by, the, time, that, mahler, began, his, duties, the, progressive, camp, had, gained, ascendancy, following, the, appointment, of, the, liberal, minded, ferenc, von, beniczky, as, intendant, aware, of, the, delicate, situation, mahler, moved, cautiously, he, delayed, his, first, appearance, on, the, conductor, s, stand, until, january, 1889, when, he, conducted, hungarian, language, performances, of, wagner, s, das, rheingold, and, die, walk, re, to, initial, public, acclaim, however, his, early, successes, faded, when, plans, to, stage, the, remainder, of, the, ring, cycle, and, other, german, operas, were, frustrated, by, a, renascent, conservative, faction, which, favoured, a, more, traditional, hungarian, programme, in, search, of, non, german, operas, to, extend, the, repertory, mahler, visited, in, spring, 1890, italy, where, among, the, works, he, discovered, was, mascagni, s, recent, sensation, cavalleria, rusticana, budapest, premiere, on, 26, december, 1890, on, 18, february, 1889, bernhard, mahler, died, this, was, followed, later, in, the, year, by, the, deaths, both, of, mahler, s, sister, leopoldine, 27, september, and, his, mother, 11, october, from, october, 1889, mahler, took, charge, of, his, four, younger, brothers, and, sisters, alois, otto, justine, and, emma, they, were, installed, in, a, rented, flat, in, vienna, mahler, himself, suffered, poor, health, with, attacks, of, haemorrhoids, and, migraine, and, a, recurrent, septic, throat, shortly, after, these, family, and, health, setbacks, the, premiere, of, the, first, symphony, in, budapest, on, 20, november, 1889, was, a, disappointment, the, critic, august, beer, s, lengthy, newspaper, review, indicates, that, enthusiasm, after, the, early, movements, degenerated, into, audible, opposition, after, the, finale, mahler, was, particularly, distressed, by, the, negative, comments, from, his, vienna, conservatory, contemporary, viktor, von, herzfeld, who, had, remarked, that, mahler, like, many, conductors, before, him, had, proved, not, to, be, a, composer, in, 1891, hungary, s, move, to, the, political, right, was, reflected, in, the, opera, house, when, beniczky, on, 1, february, was, replaced, as, intendant, by, count, g, za, zichy, a, conservative, aristocrat, determined, to, assume, artistic, control, over, mahler, s, head, however, mahler, had, foreseen, that, and, had, secretly, been, negotiating, with, bernhard, pollini, the, director, of, the, stadttheater, hamburg, since, summer, and, autumn, of, 1890, and, a, contract, was, finally, signed, in, secrecy, on, 15, january, 1891, mahler, more, or, less, forced, himself, to, be, sacked, from, his, budapest, post, and, he, succeeded, on, 14, march, 1891, by, his, departure, he, received, a, large, sum, of, indemnity, one, of, his, final, budapest, triumphs, was, a, performance, of, mozart, s, don, giovanni, 16, september, 1890, which, won, him, praise, from, brahms, who, was, present, at, the, performances, on, 16, december, 1890, during, his, budapest, years, mahler, s, compositional, output, had, been, limited, to, a, few, songs, from, the, wunderhorn, song, settings, that, became, volumes, ii, and, iii, of, lieder, und, ges, nge, and, amendments, to, the, first, symphony, mahler, s, hamburg, post, was, as, chief, conductor, subordinate, to, the, director, bernhard, pohl, known, as, pollini, who, retained, overall, artistic, control, pollini, was, prepared, to, give, mahler, considerable, leeway, if, the, conductor, could, provide, commercial, as, well, as, artistic, success, this, mahler, did, in, his, first, season, when, he, conducted, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, for, the, first, time, and, gave, acclaimed, performances, of, the, same, composer, s, tannh, user, and, siegfried, another, triumph, was, the, german, premiere, of, tchaikovsky, s, eugene, onegin, in, the, presence, of, the, composer, who, called, mahler, s, conducting, astounding, and, later, asserted, in, a, letter, that, he, believed, mahler, was, positively, a, genius, mahler, s, demanding, rehearsal, schedules, led, to, predictable, resentment, from, the, singers, and, orchestra, in, whom, according, to, music, writer, peter, franklin, the, conductor, inspired, hatred, and, respect, in, almost, equal, measure, he, found, support, however, from, hans, von, b, low, who, was, in, hamburg, as, director, of, the, city, s, subscription, concerts, b, low, who, had, spurned, mahler, s, approaches, in, kassel, had, come, to, admire, the, younger, man, s, conducting, style, and, on, b, low, s, death, in, 1894, mahler, took, over, the, direction, of, the, concerts, in, the, summer, of, 1892, mahler, took, the, hamburg, singers, to, london, to, participate, in, an, eight, week, season, of, german, opera, his, only, visit, to, britain, his, conducting, of, tristan, enthralled, the, young, composer, ralph, vaughan, williams, who, staggered, home, in, a, daze, and, could, not, sleep, for, two, nights, however, mahler, refused, further, such, invitations, as, he, was, anxious, to, reserve, his, summers, for, composing, in, 1893, he, acquired, a, retreat, at, steinbach, on, the, banks, of, lake, attersee, in, upper, austria, and, established, a, pattern, that, persisted, for, the, rest, of, his, life, summers, would, henceforth, be, dedicated, to, composition, at, steinbach, or, its, successor, retreats, now, firmly, under, the, influence, of, the, wunderhorn, folk, poem, collection, mahler, produced, a, stream, of, song, settings, at, steinbach, and, composed, his, second, and, third, symphonies, there, performances, of, mahler, works, were, still, comparatively, rare, he, had, not, composed, very, much, on, 27, october, 1893, at, hamburg, s, konzerthaus, ludwig, mahler, conducted, a, revised, version, of, his, first, symphony, still, in, its, original, five, movement, form, it, was, presented, as, a, tondichtung, tone, poem, under, the, descriptive, name, titan, this, concert, also, introduced, six, recent, wunderhorn, settings, mahler, achieved, his, first, relative, success, as, a, composer, when, the, second, symphony, was, well, received, on, its, premiere, in, berlin, under, his, own, baton, on, 13, december, 1895, mahler, s, conducting, assistant, bruno, walter, who, was, present, said, that, one, may, date, rise, to, fame, as, a, composer, from, that, day, that, same, year, mahler, s, private, life, had, been, disrupted, by, the, suicide, of, his, younger, brother, otto, on, 6, february, at, the, stadttheater, mahler, s, repertory, consisted, of, 66, operas, of, which, 36, titles, were, new, to, him, during, his, six, years, in, hamburg, he, conducted, 744, performances, including, the, debuts, of, verdi, s, falstaff, humperdinck, s, h, nsel, und, gretel, and, works, by, smetana, however, he, was, forced, to, resign, his, post, with, the, subscription, concerts, after, poor, financial, returns, and, an, ill, received, interpretation, of, his, re, scored, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, already, at, an, early, age, mahler, had, made, it, clear, that, his, ultimate, goal, was, an, appointment, in, vienna, and, from, 1895, onward, was, manoeuvring, with, the, help, of, influential, friends, to, secure, the, directorship, of, the, vienna, hofoper, he, overcame, the, bar, that, existed, against, the, appointment, of, a, jew, to, this, post, by, what, may, have, been, a, pragmatic, conversion, to, catholicism, in, february, 1897, despite, this, event, mahler, has, been, described, as, a, lifelong, agnostic, as, he, waited, for, the, emperor, s, confirmation, of, his, directorship, mahler, shared, duties, as, a, resident, conductor, with, joseph, hellmesberger, jr, son, of, the, former, conservatory, director, and, hans, richter, an, internationally, renowned, interpreter, of, wagner, and, the, conductor, of, the, original, ring, cycle, at, bayreuth, in, 1876, director, wilhelm, jahn, had, not, consulted, richter, about, mahler, s, appointment, mahler, sensitive, to, the, situation, wrote, richter, a, complimentary, letter, expressing, unswerving, admiration, for, the, older, conductor, subsequently, the, two, were, rarely, in, agreement, but, kept, their, divisions, private, vienna, the, imperial, habsburg, capital, had, recently, elected, an, anti, semitic, conservative, mayor, karl, lueger, who, had, once, proclaimed, i, myself, decide, who, is, a, jew, and, who, isn, t, in, such, a, volatile, political, atmosphere, mahler, needed, an, early, demonstration, of, his, german, cultural, credentials, he, made, his, initial, mark, in, may, 1897, with, much, praised, performances, of, wagner, s, lohengrin, and, mozart, s, die, zauberfl, te, shortly, after, the, zauberfl, te, triumph, mahler, was, forced, to, take, sick, leave, for, several, weeks, during, which, he, was, nursed, by, his, sister, justine, and, his, long, time, companion, the, viola, player, natalie, bauer, lechner, mahler, returned, to, vienna, in, late, july, to, prepare, for, vienna, s, first, uncut, version, of, the, ring, cycle, this, performance, took, place, on, 24, 27, august, attracting, critical, praise, and, public, enthusiasm, mahler, s, friend, hugo, wolf, told, bauer, lechner, that, for, the, first, time, i, have, heard, the, ring, as, i, have, always, dreamed, of, hearing, it, while, reading, the, score, on, 8, october, mahler, was, formally, appointed, to, succeed, jahn, as, the, hofoper, s, director, his, first, production, in, his, new, office, was, smetana, s, czech, nationalist, opera, dalibor, with, a, reconstituted, finale, that, left, the, hero, dalibor, alive, this, production, caused, anger, among, the, more, extreme, viennese, german, nationalists, who, accused, mahler, of, fraternising, with, the, anti, dynastic, inferior, czech, nation, the, austrian, author, stefan, zweig, in, his, memoirs, the, world, of, yesterday, 1942, described, mahler, s, appointment, as, an, example, of, the, viennese, public, s, general, distrust, of, young, artists, once, when, an, amazing, exception, occurred, and, gustav, mahler, was, named, director, of, the, court, opera, at, thirty, eight, years, old, a, frightened, murmur, and, astonishment, ran, through, vienna, because, someone, had, entrusted, the, highest, institute, of, art, to, such, a, young, person, this, suspicion, that, all, young, people, were, not, very, reliable, ran, through, all, circles, at, that, time, zweig, also, wrote, that, to, have, seen, gustav, mahler, on, the, street, was, an, event, that, one, would, proudly, report, to, his, comrades, the, next, morning, as, it, if, were, a, personal, triumph, during, mahler, s, tenure, a, total, of, 33, new, operas, were, introduced, to, the, hofoper, a, further, 55, were, new, or, totally, revamped, productions, however, a, proposal, to, stage, richard, strauss, s, controversial, opera, salome, in, 1905, was, rejected, by, the, viennese, censors, early, in, 1902, mahler, met, alfred, roller, an, artist, and, designer, associated, with, the, vienna, secession, movement, a, year, later, mahler, appointed, him, chief, stage, designer, to, the, hofoper, where, roller, s, debut, was, a, new, production, of, tristan, und, isolde, the, collaboration, between, mahler, and, roller, created, more, than, 20, celebrated, productions, of, among, other, operas, beethoven, s, fidelio, gluck, s, iphig, nie, en, aulide, and, mozart, s, le, nozze, di, figaro, in, the, figaro, production, mahler, offended, some, purists, by, adding, and, composing, a, short, recitative, scene, to, act, iii, in, spite, of, numerous, theatrical, triumphs, mahler, s, vienna, years, were, rarely, smooth, his, battles, with, singers, and, the, house, administration, continued, on, and, off, for, the, whole, of, his, tenure, while, mahler, s, methods, improved, standards, his, histrionic, and, dictatorial, conducting, style, was, resented, by, orchestra, members, and, singers, alike, in, december, 1903, mahler, faced, a, revolt, by, stagehands, whose, demands, for, better, conditions, he, rejected, in, the, belief, that, extremists, were, manipulating, his, staff, the, anti, semitic, elements, in, viennese, society, long, opposed, to, mahler, s, appointment, continued, to, attack, him, relentlessly, and, in, 1907, instituted, a, press, campaign, designed, to, drive, him, out, by, that, time, he, was, at, odds, with, the, opera, house, s, administration, over, the, amount, of, time, he, was, spending, on, his, own, music, and, was, preparing, to, leave, in, may, 1907, he, began, discussions, with, heinrich, conried, director, of, the, new, york, metropolitan, opera, and, on, 21, june, signed, a, contract, on, very, favourable, terms, for, four, seasons, conducting, in, new, york, at, the, end, of, the, summer, he, submitted, his, resignation, to, the, hofoper, and, on, 15, october, 1907, conducted, fidelio, his, 645th, and, final, performance, there, during, his, ten, years, in, vienna, mahler, had, brought, new, life, to, the, opera, house, and, cleared, its, debts, but, had, won, few, friends, it, was, said, that, he, treated, his, musicians, in, the, way, a, lion, tamer, treated, his, animals, his, departing, message, to, the, company, which, he, pinned, to, a, notice, board, was, later, torn, down, and, scattered, over, the, floor, after, conducting, the, hofoper, orchestra, in, a, farewell, concert, performance, of, his, second, symphony, on, 24, november, mahler, left, vienna, for, new, york, in, early, december, when, richter, resigned, as, head, of, the, vienna, philharmonic, subscription, concerts, in, september, 1898, the, concerts, committee, had, unanimously, chosen, mahler, as, his, successor, the, appointment, was, not, universally, welcomed, the, anti, semitic, press, wondered, if, as, a, non, german, mahler, would, be, capable, of, defending, german, music, attendances, rose, sharply, in, mahler, s, first, season, but, members, of, the, orchestra, were, particularly, resentful, of, his, habit, of, re, scoring, acknowledged, masterpieces, and, of, his, scheduling, of, extra, rehearsals, for, works, with, which, they, were, thoroughly, familiar, an, attempt, by, the, orchestra, to, have, richter, reinstated, for, the, 1899, season, failed, because, richter, was, not, interested, mahler, s, position, was, weakened, when, in, 1900, he, took, the, orchestra, to, paris, to, play, at, the, exposition, universelle, the, paris, concerts, were, poorly, attended, and, lost, money, mahler, had, to, borrow, the, orchestra, s, fare, home, from, the, rothschilds, in, april, 1901, dogged, by, a, recurrence, of, ill, health, and, wearied, by, more, complaints, from, the, orchestra, mahler, relinquished, the, philharmonic, concerts, conductorship, in, his, three, seasons, he, had, performed, around, 80, different, works, which, included, pieces, by, relatively, unknown, composers, such, as, hermann, goetz, wilhelm, kienzl, and, the, italian, lorenzo, perosi, the, demands, of, his, twin, appointments, in, vienna, initially, absorbed, all, mahler, s, time, and, energy, but, by, 1899, he, had, resumed, composing, the, remaining, vienna, years, were, to, prove, particularly, fruitful, while, working, on, some, of, the, last, of, his, des, knaben, wunderhorn, settings, he, started, his, fourth, symphony, which, he, completed, in, 1900, by, this, time, he, had, abandoned, the, composing, hut, at, steinbach, and, had, acquired, another, at, maiernigg, on, the, shores, of, the, w, rthersee, in, carinthia, where, he, later, built, a, villa, in, this, new, venue, mahler, embarked, upon, what, is, generally, considered, as, his, middle, or, post, wunderhorn, compositional, period, between, 1901, and, 1904, he, wrote, ten, settings, of, poems, by, friedrich, r, ckert, five, of, which, were, collected, as, r, ckert, lieder, the, other, five, formed, the, song, cycle, kindertotenlieder, songs, on, the, death, of, children, the, trilogy, of, orchestral, symphonies, the, fifth, the, sixth, and, the, seventh, were, composed, at, maiernigg, between, 1901, and, 1905, and, the, eighth, symphony, written, there, in, 1906, in, eight, weeks, of, furious, activity, within, this, same, period, mahler, s, works, began, to, be, performed, with, increasing, frequency, in, april, 1899, he, conducted, the, viennese, premiere, of, his, second, symphony, 17, february, 1901, saw, the, first, public, performance, of, his, early, work, das, klagende, lied, in, a, revised, two, part, form, later, that, year, in, november, mahler, conducted, the, premiere, of, his, fourth, symphony, in, munich, and, was, on, the, rostrum, for, the, first, complete, performance, of, the, third, symphony, at, the, allgemeiner, deutscher, musikverein, festival, at, krefeld, on, 9, june, 1902, mahler, first, nights, now, became, increasingly, frequent, musical, events, he, conducted, the, first, performances, of, the, fifth, and, sixth, symphonies, at, cologne, and, essen, respectively, in, 1904, and, 1906, four, of, the, r, ckert, lieder, and, kindertotenlieder, were, introduced, in, vienna, on, 29, january, 1905, during, his, second, season, in, vienna, mahler, acquired, a, spacious, modern, apartment, on, the, auenbruggergasse, and, built, a, summer, villa, on, land, he, had, acquired, next, to, his, new, composing, studio, at, maiernigg, in, november, 1901, he, met, alma, schindler, the, stepdaughter, of, painter, carl, moll, at, a, social, gathering, that, included, the, theatre, director, max, burckhard, alma, was, not, initially, keen, to, meet, mahler, on, account, of, the, scandals, about, him, and, every, young, woman, who, aspired, to, sing, in, opera, the, two, engaged, in, a, lively, disagreement, about, a, ballet, by, alexander, von, zemlinsky, alma, was, one, of, zemlinsky, s, pupils, but, agreed, to, meet, at, the, hofoper, the, following, day, this, meeting, led, to, a, rapid, courtship, mahler, and, alma, were, married, at, a, private, ceremony, on, 9, march, 1902, alma, was, by, then, pregnant, with, her, first, child, a, daughter, maria, anna, who, was, born, on, 3, november, 1902, a, second, daughter, anna, was, born, in, 1904, friends, of, the, couple, were, surprised, by, the, marriage, and, dubious, of, its, wisdom, burckhard, called, mahler, that, rachitic, degenerate, jew, unworthy, for, such, a, good, looking, girl, of, good, family, on, the, other, hand, mahler, s, family, considered, alma, to, be, flirtatious, unreliable, and, too, fond, of, seeing, young, men, fall, for, her, charms, mahler, was, by, nature, moody, and, authoritarian, natalie, bauer, lechner, his, earlier, partner, said, that, living, with, him, was, like, being, on, a, boat, that, is, ceaselessly, rocked, to, and, fro, by, the, waves, alma, soon, became, resentful, because, of, mahler, s, insistence, that, there, could, only, be, one, composer, in, the, family, and, that, she, had, given, up, her, music, studies, to, accommodate, him, the, role, of, composer, the, worker, s, role, falls, to, me, yours, is, that, of, a, loving, companion, and, understanding, partner, i, m, asking, a, very, great, deal, and, i, can, and, may, do, so, because, i, know, what, i, have, to, give, and, will, give, in, exchange, she, wrote, in, her, diary, how, hard, it, is, to, be, so, mercilessly, deprived, of, things, closest, to, one, s, heart, mahler, s, requirement, that, their, married, life, be, organized, around, his, creative, activities, imposed, strains, and, precipitated, rebellion, on, alma, s, part, the, marriage, was, nevertheless, marked, at, times, by, expressions, of, considerable, passion, particularly, from, mahler, in, the, summer, of, 1907, mahler, exhausted, from, the, effects, of, the, campaign, against, him, in, vienna, took, his, family, to, maiernigg, soon, after, their, arrival, both, daughters, fell, ill, with, scarlet, fever, and, diphtheria, anna, recovered, but, after, a, fortnight, s, struggle, maria, died, on, 12, july, immediately, following, this, devastating, loss, mahler, learned, that, his, heart, was, defective, a, diagnosis, subsequently, confirmed, by, a, vienna, specialist, who, ordered, a, curtailment, of, all, forms, of, vigorous, exercise, the, extent, to, which, mahler, s, condition, disabled, him, is, unclear, alma, wrote, of, it, as, a, virtual, death, sentence, though, mahler, himself, in, a, letter, written, to, her, on, 30, august, 1907, said, that, he, would, be, able, to, live, a, normal, life, apart, from, avoiding, over, fatigue, the, illness, was, however, a, further, depressing, factor, mahler, and, his, family, left, maiernigg, and, spent, the, rest, of, the, summer, at, schluderbach, at, the, end, of, the, summer, the, villa, at, maiernigg, was, closed, and, never, revisited, mahler, made, his, new, york, debut, at, the, metropolitan, opera, on, 1, january, 1908, when, he, conducted, wagner, s, tristan, und, isolde, in, a, busy, first, season, mahler, s, performances, were, widely, praised, especially, his, fidelio, on, 20, march, 1908, in, which, he, insisted, on, using, replicas, that, were, at, the, time, being, made, of, alfred, roller, s, vienna, sets, on, his, return, to, austria, for, the, summer, of, 1908, mahler, established, himself, in, the, third, and, last, of, his, composing, studios, in, the, pine, forests, close, to, toblach, in, tyrol, here, using, a, text, by, hans, bethge, based, on, ancient, chinese, poems, he, composed, das, lied, von, der, erde, the, song, of, the, earth, despite, the, symphonic, nature, of, the, work, mahler, refused, to, number, it, hoping, thereby, to, escape, the, curse, of, the, ninth, symphony, that, he, believed, had, affected, fellow, composers, beethoven, schubert, and, bruckner, on, 19, september, 1908, the, premiere, of, the, seventh, symphony, in, prague, was, deemed, by, alma, mahler, a, critical, rather, than, a, popular, success, for, its, 1908, 09, season, the, metropolitan, management, brought, in, the, italian, conductor, arturo, toscanini, to, share, duties, with, mahler, who, made, only, 19, appearances, in, the, entire, season, one, of, these, was, a, much, praised, performance, of, smetana, s, the, bartered, bride, on, 19, february, 1909, in, the, early, part, of, the, season, mahler, conducted, three, concerts, with, the, new, york, symphony, orchestra, this, renewed, experience, of, orchestral, conducting, inspired, him, to, resign, his, position, with, the, opera, house, and, accept, the, conductorship, of, the, re, formed, new, york, philharmonic, he, continued, to, make, occasional, guest, appearances, at, the, met, his, last, performance, being, tchaikovsky, s, the, queen, of, spades, on, 5, march, 1910, back, in, europe, for, the, summer, of, 1909, mahler, worked, on, his, ninth, symphony, and, made, a, conducting, tour, of, the, netherlands, the, 1909, 10, new, york, philharmonic, season, was, long, and, taxing, mahler, rehearsed, and, conducted, 46, concerts, but, his, programmes, were, often, too, demanding, for, popular, tastes, his, own, first, symphony, given, its, american, debut, on, 16, december, 1909, was, one, of, the, pieces, that, failed, with, critics, and, public, and, the, season, ended, with, heavy, financial, losses, the, highlight, of, mahler, s, 1910, summer, was, the, first, performance, of, the, eighth, symphony, at, munich, on, 12, september, the, last, of, his, works, to, be, premiered, in, his, lifetime, the, occasion, was, a, triumph, easily, mahler, s, biggest, lifetime, success, according, to, carr, but, it, was, overshadowed, by, the, composer, s, discovery, before, the, event, that, alma, had, begun, an, affair, with, the, young, architect, walter, gropius, greatly, distressed, mahler, sought, advice, from, sigmund, freud, and, appeared, to, gain, some, comfort, from, his, meeting, with, the, psychoanalyst, one, of, freud, s, observations, was, that, much, damage, had, been, done, by, mahler, s, insisting, that, alma, give, up, her, composing, mahler, accepted, this, and, started, to, positively, encourage, her, to, write, music, even, editing, orchestrating, and, promoting, some, of, her, works, alma, agreed, to, remain, with, mahler, although, the, relationship, with, gropius, continued, surreptitiously, in, a, gesture, of, love, mahler, dedicated, his, eighth, symphony, to, her, in, spite, of, the, emotional, distractions, during, the, summer, of, 1910, mahler, worked, on, his, tenth, symphony, completing, the, adagio, and, drafting, four, more, movements, he, and, alma, returned, to, new, york, in, late, october, 1910, where, mahler, threw, himself, into, a, busy, philharmonic, season, of, concerts, and, tours, around, christmas, 1910, he, began, suffering, from, a, sore, throat, which, persisted, on, 21, february, 1911, with, a, temperature, of, 40, c, 104, f, mahler, insisted, on, fulfilling, an, engagement, at, carnegie, hall, with, a, program, of, mainly, new, italian, music, including, the, world, premiere, of, busoni, s, berceuse, l, giaque, this, was, mahler, s, last, concert, after, weeks, confined, to, bed, he, was, diagnosed, with, bacterial, endocarditis, a, disease, to, which, people, with, defective, heart, valves, were, particularly, prone, and, which, could, be, fatal, mahler, did, not, give, up, hope, he, talked, of, resuming, the, concert, season, and, took, a, keen, interest, when, one, of, alma, s, compositions, was, sung, at, a, public, recital, by, the, soprano, frances, alda, on, 3, march, on, 8, april, the, mahler, family, and, a, permanent, nurse, left, new, york, on, board, ss, amerika, bound, for, europe, they, reached, paris, ten, days, later, where, mahler, entered, a, clinic, at, neuilly, but, there, was, no, improvement, on, 11, may, he, was, taken, by, train, to, the, l, w, sanatorium, in, vienna, where, he, developed, pneumonia, and, slipped, into, a, coma, hundreds, had, come, to, the, sanitorium, during, this, brief, period, to, show, their, admiration, for, the, great, composer, after, receiving, treatments, of, radium, to, reduce, swelling, on, his, legs, and, morphine, for, his, general, ailments, he, died, on, 18, may, on, 22, may, 1911, mahler, was, buried, in, the, grinzing, cemetery, as, he, had, requested, next, to, his, daughter, maria, his, tombstone, was, inscribed, only, with, his, name, because, any, who, come, to, look, for, me, will, know, who, i, was, and, the, rest, don, t, need, to, know, alma, on, doctors, orders, was, absent, but, among, the, mourners, at, a, relatively, pomp, free, funeral, were, arnold, schoenberg, whose, wreath, described, mahler, as, the, holy, gustav, mahler, bruno, walter, alfred, roller, the, secessionist, painter, gustav, klimt, and, representatives, from, many, of, the, great, european, opera, houses, the, new, york, times, reporting, mahler, s, death, called, him, one, of, the, towering, musical, figures, of, his, day, but, discussed, his, symphonies, mainly, in, terms, of, their, duration, incidentally, exaggerating, the, length, of, the, second, symphony, to, two, hours, and, forty, minutes, in, london, the, times, obituary, said, his, conducting, was, more, accomplished, than, that, of, any, man, save, richter, and, that, his, symphonies, were, undoubtedly, interesting, in, their, union, of, modern, orchestral, richness, with, a, melodic, simplicity, that, often, approached, banality, though, it, was, too, early, to, judge, their, ultimate, worth, alma, mahler, survived, her, husband, by, more, than, 50, years, dying, in, 1964, she, married, walter, gropius, in, 1915, divorced, him, five, years, later, and, married, the, writer, franz, werfel, in, 1929, in, 1940, she, published, a, memoir, of, her, years, with, mahler, entitled, gustav, mahler, memories, and, letters, this, account, was, criticised, by, later, biographers, as, incomplete, selective, and, self, serving, and, for, providing, a, distorted, picture, of, mahler, s, life, the, composer, s, daughter, anna, mahler, became, a, well, known, sculptor, she, died, in, 1988, the, international, gustav, mahler, society, was, founded, in, 1955, in, vienna, with, bruno, walter, as, its, first, president, and, alma, mahler, as, an, honorary, member, the, society, aims, to, create, a, complete, critical, edition, of, mahler, s, works, and, to, commemorate, all, aspects, of, the, composer, s, life, deryck, cooke, and, other, analysts, have, divided, mahler, s, composing, life, into, three, distinct, phases, a, long, first, period, extending, from, das, klagende, lied, in, 1880, to, the, end, of, the, wunderhorn, phase, in, 1901, a, middle, period, of, more, concentrated, composition, ending, with, mahler, s, departure, for, new, york, in, 1907, and, a, brief, late, period, of, elegiac, works, before, his, death, in, 1911, the, main, works, of, the, first, period, are, the, first, four, symphonies, the, lieder, eines, fahrenden, gesellen, song, cycle, and, various, song, collections, in, which, the, wunderhorn, songs, predominate, in, this, period, songs, and, symphonies, are, closely, related, and, the, symphonic, works, are, programmatic, mahler, initially, gave, the, first, three, symphonies, full, descriptive, programmes, all, of, which, he, later, repudiated, he, devised, but, did, not, publish, titles, for, each, of, the, movements, for, the, fourth, symphony, from, these, titles, the, german, music, critic, paul, bekker, conjectured, a, programme, in, which, death, appears, in, the, scherzo, in, the, friendly, legendary, guise, of, the, fiddler, tempting, his, flock, to, follow, him, out, of, this, world, the, middle, period, comprises, a, triptych, of, purely, instrumental, symphonies, the, fifth, sixth, and, seventh, the, r, ckert, songs, and, the, kindertotenlieder, two, final, wunderhorn, settings, and, in, some, reckonings, mahler, s, last, great, affirmative, statement, the, choral, eighth, symphony, cooke, believes, that, the, eighth, stands, on, its, own, between, the, middle, and, final, periods, mahler, had, by, now, abandoned, all, explicit, programmes, and, descriptive, titles, he, wanted, to, write, absolute, music, that, spoke, for, itself, cooke, refers, to, a, new, granite, like, hardness, of, orchestration, in, the, middle, period, symphonies, while, the, songs, have, lost, most, of, their, folk, character, and, cease, to, fertilise, the, symphonies, as, explicitly, as, before, the, three, works, of, the, brief, final, period, das, lied, von, der, erde, the, ninth, and, incomplete, tenth, symphonies, are, expressions, of, personal, experience, as, mahler, faced, death, each, of, the, pieces, ends, quietly, signifying, that, aspiration, has, now, given, way, to, resignation, cooke, considers, these, works, to, be, a, loving, rather, than, a, bitter, farewell, to, life, the, composer, alban, berg, called, the, ninth, the, most, marvellous, thing, that, mahler, ever, wrote, none, of, these, final, works, were, performed, in, mahler, s, lifetime, mahler, was, a, late, romantic, part, of, an, ideal, that, placed, austro, german, classical, music, on, a, higher, plane, than, other, types, through, its, supposed, possession, of, particular, spiritual, and, philosophical, significance, he, was, one, of, the, last, major, composers, of, a, line, which, includes, among, others, beethoven, schubert, liszt, wagner, bruckner, and, brahms, from, these, antecedents, mahler, drew, many, of, the, features, that, were, to, characterise, his, music, thus, from, beethoven, s, ninth, symphony, came, the, idea, of, using, soloists, and, a, choir, within, the, symphonic, genre, from, beethoven, liszt, and, from, a, different, musical, tradition, berlioz, came, the, concept, of, writing, music, with, an, inherent, narrative, or, programme, and, of, breaking, away, from, the, traditional, four, movement, symphony, format, the, examples, of, wagner, and, bruckner, encouraged, mahler, to, extend, the, scale, of, his, symphonic, works, well, beyond, the, previously, accepted, standards, to, embrace, an, entire, world, of, feeling, early, critics, maintained, that, mahler, s, adoption, of, many, different, styles, to, suit, different, expressions, of, feeling, meant, that, he, lacked, a, style, of, his, own, cooke, on, the, other, hand, asserts, that, mahler, redeemed, any, borrowings, by, imprinting, his, personality, on, practically, every, note, to, produce, music, of, outstanding, originality, the, music, critic, harold, schonberg, sees, the, essence, of, mahler, s, music, in, the, theme, of, struggle, in, the, tradition, of, beethoven, however, according, to, schonberg, beethoven, s, struggles, were, those, of, an, indomitable, and, triumphant, hero, whereas, mahler, s, are, those, of, a, psychic, weakling, a, complaining, adolescent, who, enjoyed, his, misery, wanting, the, whole, world, to, see, how, he, was, suffering, yet, schonberg, concedes, most, of, the, symphonies, contain, sections, in, which, mahler, the, deep, thinker, is, transcended, by, the, splendour, of, mahler, the, musician, except, for, his, juvenilia, little, of, which, has, survived, mahler, composed, only, in, the, media, of, song, and, symphony, with, a, close, and, complex, interrelationship, between, the, two, donald, mitchell, writes, that, this, interaction, is, the, backcloth, against, which, all, mahler, s, music, can, be, considered, the, initial, connection, between, song, and, symphony, occurs, with, the, song, cycle, lieder, eines, fahrenden, gesellen, and, the, first, symphony, although, this, early, evidence, of, cross, fertilisation, is, important, it, is, during, mahler, s, extended, wunderhorn, phase, in, which, his, second, third, and, fourth, symphonies, were, written, that, the, song, and, symphony, genres, are, consistently, intermingled, themes, from, the, wunderhorn, song, das, himmlische, leben, the, heavenly, life, composed, in, 1892, became, a, key, element, in, the, third, symphony, completed, in, 1896, the, song, itself, forms, the, finale, to, the, fourth, 1900, and, its, melody, is, central, to, the, whole, composition, for, the, second, symphony, written, between, 1888, and, 1894, mahler, worked, simultaneously, on, the, wunderhorn, song, des, antonius, von, padua, fischpredigt, the, sermon, of, st, anthony, of, padua, to, the, fishes, and, on, the, scherzo, based, on, it, which, became, the, symphony, s, third, movement, another, wunderhorn, setting, from, 1892, urlicht, primal, light, is, used, as, the, second, symphony, s, fourth, penultimate, movement, in, mahler, s, middle, and, late, periods, the, song, symphony, relationship, is, less, direct, however, musicologist, donald, mitchell, notes, specific, relationships, between, the, middle, period, songs, and, their, contemporaneous, symphonies, the, second, kindertotenlieder, song, and, the, adagietto, from, the, fifth, symphony, the, last, kindertotenlieder, song, and, the, sixth, symphony, finale, mahler, s, last, work, employing, vocal, and, orchestral, forces, das, lied, von, der, erde, is, subtitled, a, symphony, mitchell, categorises, it, as, a, song, and, symphony, the, union, of, song, and, symphonic, form, in, mahler, s, music, is, in, cooke, s, view, organic, his, songs, flower, naturally, into, symphonic, movements, being, already, symphonic, in, cast, to, sibelius, mahler, expressed, the, belief, that, the, symphony, must, be, like, the, world, it, must, embrace, everything, true, to, this, belief, mahler, drew, material, from, many, sources, into, his, songs, and, symphonic, works, bird, calls, and, cow, bells, to, evoke, nature, and, the, countryside, bugle, fanfares, street, melodies, and, country, dances, to, summon, the, lost, world, of, his, childhood, life, s, struggles, are, represented, in, contrasting, moods, the, yearning, for, fulfilment, by, soaring, melodies, and, chromatic, harmony, suffering, and, despair, by, discord, distortion, and, grotesquerie, amid, all, this, is, mahler, s, particular, hallmark, the, constant, intrusion, of, banality, and, absurdity, into, moments, of, deep, seriousness, typified, in, the, second, movement, of, the, fifth, symphony, when, a, trivial, popular, tune, suddenly, cuts, into, a, solemn, funeral, march, the, trite, melody, soon, changes, its, character, and, in, due, course, re, emerges, as, one, of, the, majestic, brucknerian, chorales, which, mahler, uses, to, signify, hope, and, the, resolution, of, conflict, mahler, himself, recognised, the, idiosyncrasies, in, his, work, calling, the, scherzo, in, the, third, symphony, the, most, farcical, and, at, the, same, time, the, most, tragic, piece, that, ever, existed, it, is, as, though, all, nature, is, making, faces, and, sticking, out, its, tongue, the, range, of, musical, moods, cooke, maintains, comes, from, mahler, s, amazing, orchestration, which, in, the, writer, s, view, defies, analysis, it, speaks, for, itself, franklin, lists, specific, features, which, are, basic, to, mahler, s, style, extremes, of, volume, the, use, of, off, stage, ensembles, unconventional, arrangement, of, orchestral, forces, and, frequent, recourse, to, popular, music, and, dance, forms, such, as, the, l, ndler, and, the, waltz, musicologist, vladim, r, karbusick, maintains, that, the, composer, s, jewish, roots, had, lasting, effects, on, his, creative, output, he, pinpoints, the, central, part, of, the, third, movement, of, the, first, symphony, as, the, most, characteristically, yiddish, music, in, mahler, s, work, the, czech, composer, journalist, max, brod, has, also, identified, jewish, tunes, and, rhythms, in, mahler, s, music, a, technical, device, much, used, by, mahler, is, that, of, progressive, tonality, which, deryck, cooke, describes, as, the, procedure, of, resolving, a, symphonic, conflict, in, a, different, key, from, that, in, which, it, was, stated, and, which, is, often, used, to, symbolise, the, gradual, ascendancy, of, a, certain, value, by, progress, from, one, key, to, another, over, the, whole, course, of, a, symphony, this, technique, was, also, used, by, mahler, s, danish, contemporary, carl, nielsen, mahler, first, employed, the, device, in, an, early, song, erinnerung, memory, and, thereafter, used, it, freely, in, his, symphonies, for, example, the, predominant, key, of, the, first, symphony, is, d, major, at, the, beginning, of, the, finale, the, conflict, movement, the, key, switches, to, f, minor, and, only, after, a, lengthy, battle, gets, back, to, d, near, the, end, the, second, symphony, begins, in, c, minor, and, ends, in, e, flat, the, movements, of, the, fifth, symphony, progress, successively, from, c, sharp, minor, to, a, minor, then, d, major, f, major, and, finally, to, d, major, the, sixth, symphony, unusually, for, mahler, begins, and, ends, in, the, same, key, a, minor, signifying, that, in, this, case, the, conflict, is, unresolved, mahler, s, friend, guido, adler, calculated, that, at, the, time, of, the, composer, s, death, in, 1911, there, had, been, more, than, 260, performances, of, the, symphonies, in, europe, russia, and, america, the, fourth, symphony, with, 61, performances, given, most, frequently, adler, did, not, enumerate, performances, of, the, songs, in, his, lifetime, mahler, s, works, and, their, performances, attracted, wide, interest, but, rarely, unqualified, approval, for, years, after, its, 1889, premiere, critics, and, public, struggled, to, understand, the, first, symphony, described, by, one, critic, after, an, 1898, dresden, performance, as, the, dullest, work, the, new, epoch, has, produced, the, second, symphony, was, received, more, positively, one, critic, calling, it, the, most, masterly, work, of, its, kind, since, mendelssohn, such, generous, praise, was, rare, particularly, after, mahler, s, accession, to, the, vienna, hofoper, directorship, his, many, enemies, in, the, city, used, the, anti, semitic, and, conservative, press, to, denigrate, almost, every, performance, of, a, mahler, work, thus, the, third, symphony, a, success, in, krefeld, in, 1902, was, treated, in, vienna, with, critical, scorn, anyone, who, has, committed, such, a, deed, deserves, a, couple, of, years, in, prison, a, mix, of, enthusiasm, consternation, and, critical, contempt, became, the, normal, response, to, new, mahler, symphonies, although, the, songs, were, better, received, after, his, fourth, and, fifth, symphonies, failed, to, gain, general, public, approval, mahler, was, convinced, that, his, sixth, would, finally, succeed, however, its, reception, was, dominated, by, satirical, comments, on, mahler, s, unconventional, percussion, effects, the, use, of, a, wooden, mallet, birch, rods, and, a, huge, square, bass, drum, viennese, critic, heinrich, reinhardt, dismissed, the, symphony, as, brass, lots, of, brass, incredibly, much, brass, even, more, brass, nothing, but, brass, the, one, unalloyed, performance, triumph, within, mahler, s, lifetime, was, the, premiere, of, the, eighth, symphony, in, munich, on, 12, september, 1910, advertised, by, its, promoters, as, the, symphony, of, a, thousand, at, its, conclusion, applause, and, celebrations, reportedly, lasted, for, half, an, hour, performances, of, mahler, s, works, became, less, frequent, after, his, death, in, the, netherlands, the, advocacy, of, willem, mengelberg, ensured, that, mahler, remained, popular, there, and, mengelberg, s, engagement, with, the, new, york, philharmonic, from, 1922, to, 1928, brought, mahler, regularly, to, american, audiences, however, much, american, critical, reaction, in, the, 1920s, was, negative, despite, a, spirited, effort, by, the, young, composer, aaron, copland, to, present, mahler, as, a, progressive, 30, years, ahead, of, his, time, and, infinitely, more, inventive, than, richard, strauss, earlier, in, 1916, leopold, stokowski, had, given, the, american, premieres, of, the, eighth, symphony, and, das, lied, von, der, erde, in, philadelphia, the, eighth, was, a, sensationally, successful, performance, that, was, immediately, taken, to, new, york, where, it, scored, a, further, triumph, an, early, proponent, of, mahler, s, work, in, britain, was, adrian, boult, who, as, conductor, of, the, city, of, birmingham, orchestra, performed, the, fourth, symphony, in, 1926, and, das, lied, von, der, erde, in, 1930, the, hall, orchestra, brought, das, lied, and, the, ninth, symphony, to, manchester, in, 1931, sir, henry, wood, staged, the, eighth, in, london, in, 1930, and, again, in, 1938, when, the, young, benjamin, britten, found, the, performance, execrable, but, was, nevertheless, impressed, by, the, music, british, critics, during, this, period, largely, treated, mahler, with, condescension, and, faint, praise, thus, dyneley, hussey, writing, in, 1934, thought, the, children, s, songs, were, delightful, but, that, the, symphonies, should, be, let, go, composer, conductor, julius, harrison, described, mahler, s, symphonies, as, interesting, at, times, but, laboriously, put, together, and, as, lacking, creative, spark, bernard, shaw, reported, that, the, younger, generation, of, the, 1930s, found, mahler, and, bruckner, expensively, second, class, before, mahler, s, music, was, banned, as, degenerate, during, the, nazi, era, the, symphonies, and, songs, were, played, in, the, concert, halls, of, germany, and, austria, often, conducted, by, bruno, walter, or, mahler, s, younger, assistant, otto, klemperer, and, also, by, willem, mengelberg, in, austria, mahler, s, work, experienced, a, brief, renaissance, between, 1934, and, 1938, a, period, known, today, as, austrofascism, when, the, authoritarian, regime, with, the, help, of, alma, mahler, and, bruno, walter, who, were, both, on, friendly, terms, with, the, new, chancellor, kurt, schuschnigg, sought, to, make, mahler, into, a, national, icon, with, a, status, comparable, to, that, of, wagner, in, germany, mahler, s, music, was, performed, during, the, nazi, era, in, berlin, in, early, 1941, and, in, amsterdam, during, the, german, occupation, of, the, netherlands, by, jewish, orchestras, and, for, jewish, audiences, alone, works, performed, included, the, second, symphony, berlin, the, first, and, fourth, symphonies, and, the, songs, of, a, wayfarer, amsterdam, according, to, american, composer, david, schiff, his, compatriot, leonard, bernstein, used, to, imply, that, he, had, single, handedly, rescued, mahler, from, oblivion, in, 1960, after, 50, years, of, neglect, schiff, points, out, that, such, neglect, was, only, relative, far, less, than, the, incomplete, disregard, of, bach, in, the, years, after, his, death, although, bernstein, gave, the, mahler, revival, further, impetus, it, was, well, under, way, before, 1960, sustained, by, conductors, such, as, stokowski, dimitri, mitropoulos, and, john, barbirolli, and, by, the, long, time, mahler, advocate, aaron, copland, mahler, himself, predicted, his, place, in, history, once, commenting, would, that, i, could, perform, my, symphonies, for, the, first, time, 50, years, after, my, death, deryck, cooke, argues, that, mahler, s, popularity, escalated, when, a, new, postwar, generation, of, music, lovers, arose, untainted, by, the, dated, polemics, of, anti, romanticism, which, had, affected, mahler, s, reputation, in, the, inter, war, years, in, this, more, liberated, age, enthusiasm, for, mahler, expanded, even, into, places, spain, france, italy, which, had, long, been, resistant, to, him, jonathan, carr, s, simpler, explanation, for, the, 1950s, mahler, revival, is, that, it, was, the, long, playing, record, rather, than, the, zeitgeist, which, made, a, comprehensive, breakthrough, possible, mahler, s, work, became, accessible, and, repeatable, in, the, home, in, the, years, following, his, centenary, in, 1960, mahler, rapidly, became, one, of, the, most, performed, and, most, recorded, of, all, composers, and, has, largely, remained, thus, in, britain, and, elsewhere, carr, notes, the, extent, of, mahler, performances, and, recordings, has, replaced, a, relative, famine, with, a, glut, bringing, problems, of, over, familiarity, harold, schonberg, comments, that, it, is, hard, to, think, of, a, composer, who, arouses, equal, loyalty, adding, that, a, response, of, anything, short, of, rapture, to, the, mahler, symphonies, will, bring, long, letters, of, furious, denunciation, in, a, letter, to, alma, dated, 16, february, 1902, mahler, wrote, with, reference, to, richard, strauss, my, day, will, come, when, his, is, ended, if, only, i, might, live, to, see, it, with, you, at, my, side, carr, observes, that, mahler, could, conceivably, have, lived, to, see, his, day, his, near, contemporary, richard, strauss, survived, until, 1949, while, sibelius, just, five, years, younger, than, mahler, lived, until, 1957, donald, mitchell, writes, that, mahler, s, influence, on, succeeding, generations, of, composers, is, a, complete, subject, in, itself, mahler, s, first, disciples, included, arnold, schoenberg, and, his, pupils, alban, berg, and, anton, webern, who, together, founded, the, second, viennese, school, mahler, s, music, influenced, the, trio, s, move, from, progressive, tonalism, to, atonality, music, without, a, key, although, mahler, rejected, atonality, he, became, a, fierce, defender, of, the, bold, originality, of, schoenberg, s, work, at, the, premiere, of, the, latter, s, first, string, quartet, in, february, 1907, mahler, reportedly, was, held, back, from, physically, attacking, the, hecklers, schoenberg, s, serenade, op, 24, 1923, berg, s, three, pieces, for, orchestra, 1915, and, webern, s, six, pieces, 1928, all, carry, echoes, of, mahler, s, seventh, symphony, mahler, has, also, influenced, the, film, scores, of, john, williams, and, other, hollywood, composers, among, other, composers, whose, work, carries, the, influence, of, mahler, mitchell, lists, america, s, aaron, copland, the, german, song, and, stage, composer, kurt, weill, italy, s, luciano, berio, russia, s, dmitri, shostakovich, and, england, s, benjamin, britten, the, american, composers, leonard, bernstein, and, samuel, barber, were, also, influenced, by, mahler, s, work, in, a, 1989, interview, the, pianist, conductor, vladimir, ashkenazy, said, that, the, connection, between, mahler, and, shostakovich, was, very, strong, and, obvious, their, music, represented, the, individual, versus, the, vices, of, the, world, mitchell, highlights, britten, s, marvellously, keen, spare, and, independent, writing, for, the, wind, in, the, first, movement, of, the, cello, symphony, of, 1963, clearly, belongs, to, that, order, of, dazzling, transparency, and, instrumental, emancipation, which, mahler, did, so, much, to, establish, mitchell, concludes, with, the, statement, even, were, his, own, music, not, to, survive, mahler, would, still, enjoy, a, substantial, immortality, in, the, music, of, these, pre, eminent, successors, who, have, embraced, his, art, and, assimilated, his, techniques, a, 2016, bbc, music, magazine, survey, of, 151, conductors, ranked, three, of, his,
