states, in, its, expositive, part, the, world, knows, that, the, land, of, upper, peru, has, been, in, the, american, continent, the, altar, where, the, free, people, shed, the, first, blood, and, the, land, where, the, last, of, the, tyrants, tombs, finally, lays, today, the, upper, peruvian, departments, protest, in, the, face, of, the, whole, earth, its, irrevocable, resolution, to, be, governed, by, themselves, through, a, decree, it, was, determined, that, the, new, state, in, upper, peru, would, carry, the, name, of, rep, blica, bol, var, in, honor, of, the, liberator, who, was, designated, as, father, of, the, republic, and, supreme, chief, of, state, bol, var, thanked, them, for, these, honors, but, declined, the, presidency, of, the, republic, a, duty, he, gave, instead, to, the, victor, of, ayacucho, grand, marshal, sucre, who, would, later, be, sworn, in, the, same, day, as, the, first, president, of, bolivia, after, some, time, the, subject, of, the, name, of, the, young, nation, arose, again, and, a, potos, an, deputy, named, manuel, mart, n, cruz, offered, a, solution, suggesting, that, in, the, same, manner, which, from, romulus, comes, rome, from, bol, var, ought, to, come, the, new, nation, of, bolivia, if, from, romulus, rome, from, bol, var, it, is, bolivia, when, bol, var, got, the, news, of, the, decision, he, felt, flattered, by, the, young, nation, but, until, then, he, had, not, willingly, accepted, upper, peru, s, independence, because, he, was, worried, about, its, future, due, to, bolivia, s, location, in, the, center, of, south, america, according, to, bol, var, this, would, create, a, nation, that, would, face, many, future, wars, bol, var, wished, that, bolivia, would, become, part, of, another, nation, preferably, peru, given, the, fact, that, it, had, been, part, of, viceroyalty, of, peru, for, centuries, or, argentina, since, during, the, last, decades, of, colonial, domain, it, had, been, part, of, viceroyalty, of, the, r, o, de, la, plata, but, what, deeply, convinced, him, otherwise, was, the, attitude, of, the, people, on, 18, august, upon, his, arrival, to, la, paz, there, was, a, demonstration, of, popular, rejoicing, the, same, scene, repeated, when, the, liberator, arrived, to, oruro, then, to, potos, and, finally, to, chuquisaca, where, he, met, his, lieutenant, of, many, years, once, more, such, a, fervent, demonstration, by, the, people, touched, bol, var, who, called, the, new, nation, his, predilect, daughter, and, was, called, by, the, peoples, of, the, new, republic, their, favorite, son, after, the, foundation, of, bolivia, he, became, also, the, commander, in, chief, of, the, armed, forces, of, bolivia, which, he, created, the, following, day, on, the, basis, of, the, guerrilla, forces, and, active, patriot, armies, stationed, at, the, time, of, the, declaration, he, gave, the, young, republic, its, first, constitution, in, 1828, in, the, battle, of, tarqui, fought, on, 27, february, 1829, heavily, outnumbered, two, to, one, sucre, defeated, a, peruvian, invasion, force, led, by, third, president, and, general, of, peru, jos, de, la, mar, whose, intentions, had, been, to, annex, guayaquil, and, the, rest, of, ecuador, to, peru, when, a, strong, movement, arose, against, bol, var, his, followers, and, the, bolivian, constitution, in, 1828, sucre, resigned, sucre, was, killed, on, 4, june, 1830, general, juan, jos, flores, wanted, to, separate, the, southern, departments, quito, guayaquil, and, azuay, called, the, district, of, ecuador, from, the, gran, colombia, so, as, to, form, an, independent, country, and, become, its, first, president, general, flores, believed, that, if, antonio, jos, de, sucre, arrived, in, quito, from, bogot, he, could, thwart, his, plans, since, sucre, was, very, popular, due, to, his, reputation, as, a, hero, and, leader, in, the, battles, of, pichincha, tarqui, and, ayacucho, general, juan, jos, flores, put, himself, in, contact, with, the, anti, bol, var, and, anti, sucre, leader, brigadier, general, and, the, commanding, general, of, cauca, jos, mar, a, obando, who, was, not, present, at, sucre, s, death, but, who, delegated, this, criminal, act, to, the, venezuelan, colonel, apolinar, morillo, commander, juan, gregorio, sarria, who, later, confessed, he, had, been, paid, by, obando, jos, erazo, a, highway, bandit, and, guerrilla, fighter, and, three, peons, as, accomplices, the, plan, was, to, ambush, jos, antonio, de, sucre, on, the, morning, of, june, 4, 1830, in, the, cold, and, bleak, forested, district, of, berruecos, along, a, narrow, path, that, was, perennially, covered, with, fog, the, five, assassins, were, hiding, behind, trees, along, the, part, of, the, trail, known, as, la, jacoba, waiting, for, sucre, s, party, which, would, be, passing, the, area, single, file, sucre, s, retinue, comprised, seven, persons, two, muleteers, with, the, baggage, two, sergeants, one, being, the, marshal, s, orderly, a, representative, to, the, congress, from, cuenca, and, his, servant, and, finally, sucre, himself, when, sucre, approached, la, jacoba, he, was, struck, by, three, bullets, two, inflicting, superficial, wounds, to, his, head, and, one, piercing, his, heart, he, fell, from, his, horse, which, had, been, shot, in, the, neck, and, died, almost, instantly, his, body, remained, there, for, twenty, four, hours, as, his, companions, fearful, of, a, similar, fate, had, fled, in, panic, later, juan, gregorio, sarria, and, colonel, apolinar, morillo, confessed, that, it, was, obando, who, had, convinced, them, to, assassinate, sucre, commander, juan, gregorio, sarria, also, confessed, that, obando, had, paid, him, to, kill, sucre, since, there, were, anti, bol, var, politicians, and, officers, in, bogot, that, wanted, to, see, both, bol, var, and, sucre, eliminated, the, ringleader, of, the, anti, bol, var, faction, in, bogot, was, francisco, de, paula, santander, who, had, previously, given, a, military, position, to, obando, and, remained, his, associate, santander, also, been, implicated, without, direct, proof, as, a, conspirator, in, the, attempt, to, assassinate, bol, var, on, september, 25, 1828, following, a, quick, military, trial, in, which, he, was, sentenced, to, death, santander, was, granted, leniency, via, the, council, of, ministers, and, despite, having, reservations, bol, var, commuted, santander, s, sentence, and, exiled, him, instead, until, his, return, to, new, granada, in, 1832, the, three, peons, who, were, part, of, the, sucre, assassination, party, were, poisoned, by, apolinar, morillo, to, prevent, them, from, testifying, about, sucre, s, murder, in, the, end, colonel, apolinar, morillo, was, convicted, and, shot, in, the, main, square, of, bogot, for, the, murder, of, sucre, on, 30, november, 1842, and, jos, erazo, died, in, prison, that, same, year, jos, maria, obando, was, granted, immunity, due, to, the, fact, that, he, was, too, powerful, in, the, cauca, department, the, following, day, sucre, s, orderly, a, sergeant, named, lorenzo, caicedo, with, some, help, from, others, buried, the, body, and, marked, the, makeshift, grave, with, a, cross, formed, of, branches, when, the, widow, received, news, of, the, assassination, she, promptly, brought, sucre, s, remains, from, berruecos, to, quito, where, they, were, interred, in, secret, in, the, oratory, of, the, chapel, of, el, dean, on, one, of, her, haciendas, subsequently, she, had, the, remains, transferred, also, in, secret, to, the, carmen, bajo, convent, in, quito, where, they, were, placed, facing, the, main, altar, of, the, church, seventy, years, later, in, april, 1900, sucre, s, remains, were, discovered, and, their, authenticity, scrupulously, verified, transferred, to, the, quito, cathedral, on, 4, june, 1900, in, a, sumptuous, parade, led, by, the, executive, and, his, ministers, the, high, dignitaries, of, the, church, and, the, diplomatic, corps, at, the, time, the, government, ordered, the, building, of, a, crypt, but, it, was, not, inaugurated, until, thirty, two, years, later, on, 4, august, 1932, this, mausoleum, consisted, of, a, nine, ton, monolith, of, granite, from, the, quarries, of, the, pichincha, volcano, its, cover, on, which, a, cross, is, carved, in, high, relief, was, so, heavy, that, thirty, persons, were, required, to, move, it, into, place, according, to, the, 19, december, 1830, gaceta, de, colombia, issue, no, 495, a, power, hungry, ambitious, general, obando, paid, an, assassin, to, kill, sucre, by, falsely, informing, the, assassin, that, sucre, was, a, traitor, and, had, to, be, stopped, because, sucre, s, intentions, were, to, go, to, quito, and, separate, the, department, of, cauca, and, the, three, southern, departments, of, colombia, and, unite, them, with, peru, in, reality, sucre, a, prot, g, of, bol, var, was, going, to, quito, to, stop, the, separation, of, the, district, of, ecuador, from, the, gran, colombia, and, to, retire, as, soon, as, possible, in, quito, to, live, a, quiet, life, with, his, wife, some, have, argued, that, sucre, was, ordered, assassinated, by, general, obando, so, as, to, leave, no, clear, successor, to, bol, var, in, the, gran, colombia, before, his, death, bol, var, believed, sucre, to, be, the, only, man, who, could, have, reunited, the, gran, colombia, however, bol, var, s, generals, and, the, majority, of, the, politicians, running, the, separate, departments, of, the, gran, colombia, had, other, selfish, and, ambitious, plans, sucre, represented, according, to, historian, tom, s, polanco, alc, ntara, the, indispensable, complement, to, sim, n, bol, var, upon, hearing, the, news, of, sucre, s, death, bol, var, said, se, ha, derramado, dios, excelso, la, sangre, del, inocente, abel, the, blood, of, the, innocent, abel, has, been, spilled, oh, most, high, god, bol, var, later, wrote, gaceta, de, colombia, 4, july, 1830, if, he, had, breathed, his, spirit, upon, the, theater, of, victory, with, his, last, breath, he, would, have, given, thanks, to, heaven, for, having, given, him, a, glorious, death, but, cowardly, murdered, in, a, dark, mountain, he, leaves, his, fatherland, the, duty, of, prosecuting, this, crime, and, of, adopting, measures, that, will, curb, new, scandals, and, the, repetition, of, scenes, as, lamentable, and, painful, as, this, sucre, is, buried, in, the, cathedral, of, quito, ecuador, as, he, had, said, i, want, my, bones, to, be, forever, in, quito, where, his, wife, mariana, de, carcel, n, y, larrea, marquise, of, solanda, was, from
