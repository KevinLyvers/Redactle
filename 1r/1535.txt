slave, uprising, against, the, roman, republic, historical, accounts, of, his, life, come, primarily, from, plutarch, and, appian, who, wrote, more, than, a, century, after, his, death, plutarch, s, life, of, crassus, and, appian, s, civil, wars, provide, the, most, comprehensive, details, of, the, slave, revolt, despite, being, a, significant, figure, in, roman, history, no, contemporary, sources, exist, and, all, accounts, were, by, those, not, directly, involved, significantly, later, and, without, perspectives, from, slaves, or, eyewitnesses, little, is, known, about, him, beyond, the, events, of, the, war, and, surviving, accounts, are, contradictory, all, sources, agree, he, was, a, former, gladiator, and, accomplished, military, leader, spartacus, is, described, as, a, thracian, by, birth, possibly, from, the, maedi, tribe, before, his, enslavement, and, role, as, a, gladiator, he, had, served, as, a, soldier, with, the, romans, his, revolt, began, in, 73, bc, when, he, along, with, about, 70, other, gladiators, escaped, a, gladiatorial, school, near, capua, despite, their, small, numbers, initially, spartacus, s, forces, were, able, to, defeat, several, roman, military, units, swelling, their, ranks, to, an, estimated, 70, 000, enslaved, people, and, others, spartacus, proved, himself, a, capable, tactician, despite, the, lack, of, formal, military, training, among, his, followers, which, included, a, diverse, mix, of, individuals, the, rebellion, posed, a, significant, challenge, to, roman, authority, prompting, a, series, of, military, campaigns, against, it, ultimately, marcus, licinius, crassus, was, tasked, with, suppressing, the, revolt, despite, initial, successes, and, attempts, to, negotiate, and, escape, to, sicily, spartacus, s, forces, were, defeated, in, 71, bc, spartacus, was, presumed, killed, in, the, final, battle, although, his, body, was, never, found, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, saw, the, crucifixion, of, 6, 000, surviving, rebels, along, the, appian, way, spartacus, s, motives, remain, a, subject, of, debate, with, some, sources, suggesting, he, aimed, to, escape, italy, while, others, hint, at, broader, social, reform, goals, his, legacy, has, endured, inspiring, cultural, works, and, becoming, a, symbol, for, resistance, and, revolutionary, movements, influencing, figures, like, karl, marx, and, being, likened, to, the, black, spartacus, toussaint, louverture, the, rebellion, interpreted, as, an, example, of, oppressed, people, fighting, for, their, freedom, against, a, slave, owning, oligarchy, has, been, featured, in, literature, television, and, film, the, philosopher, voltaire, described, the, third, servile, war, as, the, only, just, war, in, history, although, this, interpretation, is, not, specifically, contradicted, by, classical, historians, no, historical, account, mentions, that, the, goal, was, to, end, slavery, in, the, republic, there, are, two, main, sources, on, spartacus, both, of, which, were, written, a, century, or, more, after, his, death, plutarch, of, chaeronea, 46, ad, 119, ad, and, appian, of, alexandria, 95, ad, ad, 165, the, specific, works, are, life, of, crassus, early, second, century, ad, by, plutarch, and, civil, wars, early, to, mid, second, century, ad, by, appian, out, of, all, surviving, sources, on, spartacus, none, were, written, by, eyewitnesses, and, are, all, later, reconstructions, nor, were, the, sources, written, by, slaves, or, former, slaves, and, the, earliest, source, was, at, least, a, generation, after, the, war, the, greek, essayist, plutarch, describes, spartacus, as, a, thracian, of, nomadic, stock, in, a, possible, reference, to, the, maedi, tribe, appian, says, he, was, a, thracian, by, birth, who, had, once, served, as, a, soldier, with, the, romans, but, had, since, been, a, prisoner, and, sold, for, a, gladiator, florus, described, him, as, one, who, from, a, thracian, mercenary, had, become, a, roman, soldier, that, had, deserted, and, became, enslaved, and, afterward, from, consideration, of, his, strength, a, gladiator, the, authors, refer, to, the, thracian, tribe, of, the, maedi, which, occupied, the, area, on, the, southwestern, fringes, of, thrace, along, its, border, with, the, roman, province, of, macedonia, present, day, south, western, bulgaria, plutarch, also, writes, that, spartacus, s, wife, a, prophetess, of, the, maedi, tribe, was, enslaved, with, him, the, name, spartacus, is, otherwise, manifested, in, the, black, sea, region, five, out, of, twenty, kings, of, the, thracian, spartocid, dynasty, of, the, cimmerian, bosporus, and, pontus, are, known, to, have, borne, it, and, a, thracian, sparta, spardacus, or, sparadokos, father, of, seuthes, i, of, the, odrysae, is, also, known, one, modern, author, estimates, that, spartacus, was, c, 30, years, old, at, the, time, he, started, his, revolt, which, would, put, his, birth, year, c, 103, bc, according, to, the, differing, sources, and, their, interpretation, spartacus, was, a, captive, taken, by, the, legions, spartacus, was, trained, at, the, gladiatorial, school, ludus, near, capua, belonging, to, lentulus, batiatus, he, was, a, heavyweight, gladiator, called, a, murmillo, these, fighters, carried, a, large, oblong, shield, scutum, and, used, a, sword, with, a, broad, straight, blade, gladius, about, 18, inches, long, in, 73, bc, spartacus, was, among, a, group, of, gladiators, plotting, an, escape, about, 70, slaves, were, part, of, the, plot, though, few, in, number, they, seized, kitchen, utensils, fought, their, way, free, from, the, school, and, seized, several, wagons, of, gladiatorial, weapons, and, armour, the, escaped, slaves, defeated, soldiers, sent, after, them, plundered, the, region, surrounding, capua, recruited, many, other, slaves, into, their, ranks, and, eventually, retired, to, a, more, defensible, position, on, mount, vesuvius, once, free, the, escaped, gladiators, chose, spartacus, and, two, gallic, slaves, crixus, and, oenomaus, as, their, leaders, although, roman, authors, assumed, that, the, escaped, slaves, were, a, homogeneous, group, with, spartacus, as, their, leader, they, may, have, projected, their, own, hierarchical, view, of, military, leadership, onto, the, spontaneous, organization, reducing, other, slave, leaders, to, subordinate, positions, in, their, accounts, the, response, of, the, romans, was, hampered, by, the, absence, of, the, roman, legions, which, were, engaged, in, fighting, a, revolt, in, hispania, and, the, third, mithridatic, war, furthermore, the, romans, considered, the, rebellion, more, of, a, policing, matter, than, a, war, rome, dispatched, militia, under, the, command, of, the, praetor, gaius, claudius, glaber, who, besieged, spartacus, and, his, camp, on, mount, vesuvius, hoping, that, starvation, would, force, spartacus, to, surrender, they, were, taken, by, surprise, when, spartacus, used, ropes, made, from, vines, to, climb, down, the, steep, side, of, the, volcano, with, his, men, and, attacked, the, unfortified, roman, camp, in, the, rear, killing, most, of, the, militia, the, rebels, also, defeated, a, second, expedition, against, them, nearly, capturing, the, praetor, commander, killing, his, lieutenants, and, seizing, the, military, equipment, due, to, these, successes, more, and, more, slaves, flocked, to, the, spartacan, forces, as, did, many, of, the, herdsmen, and, shepherds, of, the, region, swelling, their, ranks, to, some, 70, 000, at, its, height, spartacus, s, army, included, many, different, peoples, including, celts, gauls, and, others, due, to, the, previous, social, war, 91, 87, bc, some, of, spartacus, s, ranks, were, legion, veterans, of, the, slaves, that, joined, spartacus, ranks, many, were, from, the, countryside, rural, slaves, lived, a, life, that, better, prepared, them, to, fight, in, spartacus, s, army, in, contrast, urban, slaves, were, more, used, to, city, life, and, were, considered, privileged, and, lazy, in, these, altercations, spartacus, proved, to, be, an, excellent, tactician, suggesting, that, he, may, have, had, previous, military, experience, though, the, rebels, lacked, military, training, they, displayed, skilful, use, of, available, local, materials, and, unusual, tactics, against, the, disciplined, roman, armies, they, spent, the, winter, of, 73, 72, bc, training, arming, and, equipping, their, new, recruits, and, expanding, their, raiding, territory, to, include, the, towns, of, nola, nuceria, thurii, and, metapontum, the, distance, between, these, locations, and, the, subsequent, events, indicate, that, the, slaves, operated, in, two, groups, commanded, by, spartacus, and, crixus, in, the, spring, of, 72, bc, the, rebels, left, their, winter, encampments, and, began, to, move, northward, at, the, same, time, the, roman, senate, alarmed, by, the, defeat, of, the, praetorian, forces, dispatched, a, pair, of, consular, legions, under, the, command, of, lucius, gellius, and, gnaeus, cornelius, lentulus, clodianus, the, two, legions, were, initially, successful, defeating, a, group, of, 30, 000, rebels, commanded, by, crixus, near, mount, garganus, but, then, were, defeated, by, spartacus, these, defeats, are, depicted, in, divergent, ways, by, the, two, most, comprehensive, extant, histories, of, the, war, by, appian, and, plutarch, alarmed, at, the, continued, threat, posed, by, the, slaves, the, senate, charged, marcus, licinius, crassus, the, wealthiest, man, in, rome, and, the, only, volunteer, for, the, position, with, ending, the, rebellion, crassus, was, put, in, charge, of, eight, legions, numbering, upwards, of, 40, 000, trained, roman, soldiers, he, treated, these, with, harsh, discipline, reviving, the, punishment, of, decimation, in, which, one, tenth, of, his, men, were, slain, to, make, them, more, afraid, of, him, than, their, enemy, when, spartacus, and, his, followers, who, for, unclear, reasons, had, retreated, to, the, south, of, italy, moved, northward, again, in, early, 71, bc, crassus, deployed, six, of, his, legions, on, the, borders, of, the, region, and, detached, his, legate, mummius, with, two, legions, to, maneuver, behind, spartacus, though, ordered, not, to, engage, the, rebels, mummius, attacked, at, a, seemingly, opportune, moment, but, was, routed, after, this, crassus, s, legions, were, victorious, in, several, engagements, forcing, spartacus, farther, south, through, lucania, as, crassus, gained, the, upper, hand, by, the, end, of, 71, bc, spartacus, was, encamped, in, rhegium, reggio, calabria, near, the, strait, of, messina, according, to, plutarch, spartacus, made, a, bargain, with, cilician, pirates, to, transport, him, and, some, 2, 000, of, his, men, to, sicily, where, he, intended, to, incite, a, slave, revolt, and, gather, reinforcements, however, he, was, betrayed, by, the, pirates, who, took, payment, and, then, abandoned, the, rebels, minor, sources, mention, that, there, were, some, attempts, at, raft, and, shipbuilding, by, the, rebels, as, a, means, to, escape, but, that, crassus, took, unspecified, measures, to, ensure, the, rebels, could, not, cross, to, sicily, and, their, efforts, were, abandoned, spartacus, s, forces, then, retreated, toward, rhegium, crassus, s, legions, followed, and, upon, arrival, built, fortifications, across, the, isthmus, at, rhegium, despite, harassing, raids, from, the, rebels, the, rebels, were, now, under, siege, and, cut, off, from, their, supplies, at, this, time, the, legions, of, pompey, returned, from, hispania, and, were, ordered, by, the, senate, to, head, south, to, aid, crassus, crassus, feared, that, pompey, s, involvement, would, deprive, him, of, credit, for, defeating, spartacus, himself, hearing, of, pompey, s, involvement, spartacus, tried, to, make, a, truce, with, crassus, when, crassus, refused, spartacus, and, his, army, broke, through, the, roman, fortifications, and, headed, to, brundusium, with, crassus, s, legions, in, pursuit, when, the, legions, managed, to, catch, a, portion, of, the, rebels, separated, from, the, main, army, discipline, among, spartacus, s, forces, broke, down, as, small, groups, independently, attacked, the, oncoming, legions, spartacus, now, turned, his, forces, around, and, brought, his, entire, strength, to, bear, on, the, legions, in, a, last, stand, in, which, the, rebels, were, routed, completely, with, the, vast, majority, of, them, being, killed, on, the, battlefield, the, final, battle, that, saw, the, assumed, defeat, of, spartacus, in, 71, bc, took, place, on, the, present, territory, of, senerchia, on, the, right, bank, of, the, river, sele, in, the, area, that, includes, the, border, with, oliveto, citra, up, to, those, of, calabritto, near, the, village, of, quaglietta, in, the, high, sele, valley, which, at, that, time, was, part, of, lucania, in, this, area, since, 1899, there, have, been, finds, of, armour, and, swords, of, the, roman, era, plutarch, appian, and, florus, all, claim, that, spartacus, died, during, the, battle, but, appian, also, reports, that, his, body, was, never, found, six, thousand, survivors, of, the, revolt, captured, by, the, legions, of, crassus, were, crucified, lining, the, appian, way, from, rome, to, capua, a, distance, of, more, than, 100, miles, classical, historians, were, divided, as, to, the, motives, of, spartacus, none, of, spartacus, s, actions, overtly, suggest, that, he, aimed, at, reforming, roman, society, or, abolishing, slavery, plutarch, writes, that, spartacus, wished, to, escape, north, into, cisalpine, gaul, and, disperse, his, men, back, to, their, homes, if, escaping, the, italian, peninsula, was, indeed, his, goal, it, is, not, clear, why, spartacus, turned, south, after, defeating, the, legions, commanded, by, the, consuls, lucius, publicola, and, gnaeus, clodianus, which, left, his, force, a, clear, passage, over, the, alps, appian, and, florus, write, that, he, intended, to, march, on, rome, itself, appian, also, states, that, he, later, abandoned, that, goal, which, might, have, been, no, more, than, a, reflection, of, roman, fears, based, on, the, events, in, late, 73, bc, and, early, 72, bc, which, suggest, independently, operating, groups, of, escaped, slaves, and, a, statement, by, plutarch, it, appears, that, some, of, the, escaped, slaves, preferred, to, plunder, italy, rather, than, escape, over, the, alps, toussaint, louverture, a, leader, of, the, slave, revolt, that, led, to, the, independence, of, haiti, has, been, called, the, black, spartacus, adam, weishaupt, founder, of, the, bavarian, illuminati, often, referred, to, himself, as, spartacus, within, written, correspondences, in, modern, times, spartacus, became, a, hero, and, icon, for, communists, and, socialists, karl, marx, listed, spartacus, as, one, of, his, heroes, and, described, him, as, the, most, splendid, fellow, in, the, whole, of, ancient, history, and, a, great, general, noble, character, real, representative, of, the, ancient, proletariat, spartacus, has, been, a, great, inspiration, to, left, wing, revolutionaries, most, notably, the, german,
