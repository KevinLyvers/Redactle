initially, blocked, by, the, soviet, leadership, which, mistrusted, the, special, east, west, german, relationship, particularly, efforts, to, expand, east, germany, s, limited, independence, in, the, realm, of, foreign, policy, in, the, late, 1980s, soviet, leader, mikhail, gorbachev, introduced, glasnost, and, perestroika, reforms, to, liberalise, the, socialist, planned, economy, frictions,

reportedly, telling, gorbachev, we, have, done, our, perestroika, we, have, nothing, to, restructure, gorbachev, grew, to, dislike, honecker, and, by, 1988, was, lumping, him, in, with, bulgaria, s, todor, zhivkov, czechoslovakia, s, gust, v, hus, k, and, romania, s, nicolae, ceau, escu, as, a, gang, of, four, a, group, of, inflexible, hardliners, unwilling, to, make, reforms, according, to, white, house, experts, philip, zelikow, and, condoleezza, rice, gorbachev, looked, to, communist, leaders, in, eastern, europe, to, follow, his, example, of, perestroika, and, glasnost, they, argue, western, analysts, according, to, zelikow, and, rice, believed, in, 1989, that, communism, was, still, secure, in, east, germany, honecker, felt, betrayed, by, gorbachev, in, his, german, policy, and, ensured, that, official, texts, of, the, soviet, union, especially, those, concerning, perestroika, could, no, longer, be, published, or, sold, in, east, germany, one, month, after, the, 1989, polish, legislative, election, in, which, lech, wa, sa, and, the, solidarity, citizens, committee, unexpectedly, won, 99, out, of, 100, votes, at, the, warsaw, pact, summit, on, 7, 8, july, 1989, in,

statement, prescribed, that, its, signees, henceforth, developed, their, own, political, line, strategy, and, tactics, without, external, intervention, this, called, into, question, the, soviet, guarantee, of, existence, for, the, communist, states, in, europe, already, in, may, 1989, hungary, had, begun, dismantling, its, border, with, austria, creating, the, first, gap, in, the, so, called, iron, curtain, through, which, later, several, thousand, east, germans, quickly, fled, in, hopes, of, reaching, west, germany, by, way, of, austria, but, with, the, mass, exodus, at, the, pan, european, picnic, in, august, 1989, which, was, based, on, an, idea, by, otto, von, habsburg, to, test, gorbachev, s, reaction, to, the, opening, of, the, border, the, subsequent, hesitant, behaviour, of, the, socialist, unity, party, of, east, germany, and, the, non, intervention, of, the, soviet, union, opened, the, floodgates, thus, the, united, front, of, the, eastern, bloc, was, broken, the, reaction, to, this, from, erich, honecker, in, the, daily, mirror, of, august, 19, 1989, was, too, late, and, showed, the, current, loss, of, power, habsburg, distributed, leaflets, far, into, poland, on, which, the, east, german, holidaymakers, were, invited, to, a, picnic, when, they, came, to, the, picnic, they, were, given, gifts, food, and, deutsche, mark, and, then, they, were, persuaded, to, come, to, the, west, later, after, his, fall, honecker, said, of, otto, von, habsburg, in, connection, with, the, summer, of, 1989, that, this, habsburg, drove, the, nail, into, my, coffin, now, tens, of, thousands, of, media, informed, east, germans, made, their, way, to, hungary, which, was, no, longer, ready, to, keep, its, borders, completely, closed, or, to, oblige, its, border, troops, to, use, force, of, arms, a, 1969, treaty, required, the, hungarian, government, to, send, the, east, germans, back, home, however, starting, on, 11, september, 1989, the, hungarians, let, them, pass, into, austria, telling, their, outraged, east, german, counterparts, that, they, were, refugees, and, that, international, treaties, on, refugees, took, precedence, at, the, time, honecker, was, sidelined, through, illness, leaving, his, colleagues, unable, to, act, decisively, he, had, been, taken, ill, with, biliary, colic, during, the, warsaw, pact, summit, he, was, shortly, afterwards, flown, home, to, east, berlin, after, an, initial, stabilisation, in, his, health, he, underwent, surgery, on, 18, august, 1989, to, remove, his, inflamed, gallbladder, and, due, to, a, perforation, part, of, his, colon, according, to, the, urologist, peter, althaus, the, surgeons, left, a, suspected, carcinogenic, nodule, in, honecker, s, right, kidney, due, to, his, weak, condition, and, also, failed, to, inform, the, patient, of, the, suspected, cancer, other, sources, say, the, tumour, was, simply, undetected, as, a, result, of, this, operation, honecker, was, away, from, his, office, until, late, september, 1989, back, in, office, honecker, had, to, contend, with, the, rising, number, and, strength, of, demonstrations, across, east, germany, that, had, first, been, sparked, by, reports, in, the, west, german, media, of, fraudulent, results, in, local, elections, on, 7, may, 1989, the, same, results, he, had, labelled, a, convincing, reflection, of, the, populace, s, faith, in, his, leadership, he, also, had, to, deal, with, a, new, refugee, problem, several, thousand, east, germans, tried, to, go, to, west, germany, by, way, of, czechoslovakia, only, to, have, that, government, bar, them, from, passing, several, thousands, of, them, headed, straight, for, the, west, german, embassy, in, prague, and, demanded, safe, passage, to, west, germany, with, some, reluctance, honecker, allowed, them, to, go, but, forced, them, to, go, back, through, east, germany, on, sealed, trains, and, stripped, them, of, their, east, german, citizenship, several, members, of, the, sed, politb, ro, realised, this, was, a, serious, blunder, and, made, plans, to, get, rid, of, him, as, unrest, visibly, grew, large, numbers, began, fleeing, the, country, through, the, west, german, embassies, in, prague, and, budapest, as, well, as, over, the, borders, of, the, socialist, brother, states, each, month, saw, tens, of, thousands, more, exit, on, 3, october, 1989, east, germany, closed, its, borders, to, its, eastern, neighbours, and, prevented, visa, free, travel, to, czechoslovakia, a, day, later, these, measures, were, also, extended, to, travel, to, bulgaria, and, romania, east, germany, was, now, not, only, behind, the, iron, curtain, to, the, west, but, also, cordoned, off, from, most, other, eastern, bloc, states, on, 6, 7, october, 1989, the, national, celebrations, of, the, 40th, anniversary, of, the, east, german, state, took, place, with, gorbachev, in, attendance, to, the, surprise, of, honecker, and, the, other, sed, leaders, in, attendance, several, hundred, members, of, the, free, german, youth, reckoned, as, the, future, vanguard, of, the, party, and, nation, began, chanting, gorby, help, us, gorby, save, us, in, a, private, conversation, between, the, two, leaders, honecker, praised, the, success, of, the, country, but, gorbachev, knew, that, in, reality, it, faced, bankruptcy, east, germany, had, already, accepted, billions, of, dollars, in, loans, from, west, germany, during, the, decade, as, it, sought, to, stabilise, its, economy, attempting, to, make, honecker, accept, a, need, for, reforms, gorbachev, warned, honecker, that, he, who, is, too, late, is, punished, by, life, yet, honecker, maintained, that, we, will, solve, our, problems, ourselves, with, socialist, means, protests, outside, the, reception, at, the, palace, of, the, republic, led, to, hundreds, of, arrests, in, which, many, were, brutally, beaten, by, soldiers, and, police, being, able, to, have, an, apartment, a, job, clothes, to, put, on, something, to, eat, and, not, having, to, sleep, under, bridges, that, was, already, for, erich, honecker, socialism, as, the, reform, movement, spread, throughout,

monday, nights, across, the, country, in, response, an, elite, paratroop, unit, was, dispatched, to, leipzig, almost, certainly, on, honecker, s, orders, since, he, was, commander, in, chief, of, the, army, a, bloodbath, was, averted, only, when, local, party, officials, themselves, ordered, the, troops, to, pull, back, in, the, following, week, honecker, faced, a, torrent, of, criticism, this, gave, his, politburo, comrades, the, impetus, they, needed, to, replace, him, after, a, crisis, meeting, of, the, politburo, on, 10, 11, october, 1989, honecker, s, planned, state, visit, to, denmark, was, cancelled, and, despite, his, resistance, at, the, insistence, of, the, regime, s, number, two, man, egon, krenz, a, public, statement, was, issued, that, called, for, suggestions, for, attractive, socialism, over, the, following, days, krenz, worked, to, secure, himself, the, support, of, the, military, and, the, stasi, and, arranged, a, meeting, between, gorbachev, and, politburo,

is, the, release, of, comrade, erich, honecker, as, general, secretary, and, the, election, of, comrade, egon, krenz, in, his, place, honecker, reportedly, calmly, responded, well, then, i, open, the, debate, all, those, present, then, spoke, in, turn, but, none, in, favour, of, honecker, g, nter, schabowski, even, extended, the, dismissal, of, honecker, to, also, include, his, posts, in, the, state, council, and, as, chairman, of, the, national, defence, council, while, childhood, friend, g, nter, mittag, moved, away, from, honecker, mielke, hollering, and, pounding, the, conference, room, table, with, his, fist, pointed, at, honecker, and, blamed, him, for, almost, all, the, country, s, current, ills, and, threatened, to, publish, compromising, information, that, he, possessed, if, honecker, refused, to, resign, a, zdf, documentary, on, the, matter, claims, this, information, was, contained, in, a, large, red, briefcase, found, in, mielke, s, possession, in, 1990, after, three, hours, the, politburo, voted, to, remove, honecker, in, accordance, with, longstanding, practice, honecker, voted, for, his, own, removal, when, the, public, announcement, was, made, it, was, branded, as, a, voluntary, decision, on, honecker, s, part, ostensibly, due, to, health, reasons, krenz, was, unanimously, elected, as, his, successor, as, general, secretary, three, weeks, after, honecker, s,

gave, the, order, to, fire, on, escapees, at, the, inner, german, border, in, 1961, and, had, repeatedly, reiterated, that, command, most, specifically, in, 1974, however, this, warrant, was, not, enforceable, because, honecker, lay, under, the, protection, of, soviet, authorities, in, beelitz, on, 13, march, 1991, the, honeckers, fled, germany, from, the, soviet, controlled, sperenberg, airfield, to, moscow, on, a, military, jet, with, the, aid, of, soviet, hardliners, the, german, chancellery, had, only, been, informed, by, soviet, diplomats, about, the, honeckers, flight, to, moscow, one, hour, in, advance, it, limited, its, response, to, a, public, protest, claiming, the, existence, of, an, arrest, warrant, meant, the, soviet, union, was, breaching, international, law, by, admitting, honecker, the, initial, soviet, reaction, was, that, honecker, was, now, too, ill, to, travel, and, was, receiving, medical, treatment, after, a, deterioration, of, his, health, he, underwent, further, surgery, the, following, month, on, 11, december, 1991, the, honeckers, sought, refuge, in, the, chilean, embassy, in, moscow, while, also, applying, for, political, asylum, in,

rule, east, germany, had, granted, many, chileans, exile, following, the, military, coup, of, 1973, by, augusto, pinochet, in, addition, his, daughter, sonja, was, married, to, a, chilean, chilean,

where, she, initially, stayed, with, her, daughter, sonja, honecker, s, lawyers, unsuccessfully, appealed, for, him, to, be, released, from, detention, in, the, period, leading, up, to, his, trial, on, 12, may, 1992, while, under, protection, in, the, chilean, embassy, in, moscow, honecker, along, with, several, co, defendants, including, erich, mielke, willi, stoph, heinz, kessler, fritz, streletz, and, hans, albrecht, were, accused, in, a, 783, page, indictment, of, taking, part, in, the, collective, manslaughter, of, 68, people, as, they, attempted, to, flee, east, germany, it, was, alleged, that, honecker, in, his, role, as, chairman, of, the, national, defence, council, had, both, given, the, decisive, order, in, 1961, for, the, construction, of, the, berlin, wall, and, also, at, subsequent, meetings, ordered, the, extensive, expansion, of, the, border, fortifications, around, west, berlin, and, the, barriers, to, the, west, so, as, to, make, any, passing, impossible, in, addition, specifically, at, a, may, 1974, sitting, of, the, national, defence, council, he, had, stated, that, the, development, of, the, border, must, continue, that, lines, of, fire, were, warranted, along, the, whole, border, and, as, prior, the, use, of, firearms, was, essential, comrades, who, have, successfully, used, their, firearms, to, be, praised, honecker, in, his, role, of, chairman, of, the, party, was, responsible, for, the, deaths, of, many, more, than, the, 68, mentioned, above, as, of, 22, april, 2015, well, over, 1, 000, deaths, have, been, discovered, mainly, through, secret, east, german, documentation, it, is, still, not, known, for, sure, how, many, people, died, on, the, inner, german, border, or, who, they, were, as, the, east, german, state, treated, such, information, as, a, closely, guarded, secret, but, numbers, have, risen, steadily, since, unification, as, evidence, has, been, gathered, from, east, german, records, current, unofficial, estimates, put, the, figure, at, up, to, 1, 100, people, the, charges, were, approved, by, the, berlin, district, court, on, 19, october, 1992, at, the, opening, of, the, trial, on, the, same, day, it, was, decided, that, the, hearing, of, 56, charges, would, be, postponed, and, the, remaining, twelve, cases, would, be, the, subject, of, the, trial, to, begin, on, 12, november, 1992, the, question, of, under, which, laws, the, former, east, german, leader, could, be, tried, was, highly, controversial, and, in, the, view, of, many, jurists, the, process, had, an, uncertain, outcome, during, his, 70, minute, long, statement, to, the, court, on, 3, december, 1992, honecker, said, that, he, had, political, responsibility, for, the, building, of, the, berlin, wall, and, subsequent, deaths, at, the, borders, but, claimed, he, was, without, juridical, legal, or, moral, guilt, he, blamed, the, escalation, of, the, cold, war, for, the, building, of, the, berlin, wall, saying, the, decision, had, not, been, taken, solely, by, the, east, german, leadership, but, all, the, warsaw, pact, countries, that, had, collectively, concluded, in, 1961, that, a, third, world, war, with, millions, dead, would, be, unavoidable, without, this, action, he, quoted, several, west, german, politicians, who, had, opined, that, the, wall, had, indeed, reduced, and, stabilised, the, two, factions, he, stated, that, he, had, always, regretted, every, death, both, from, a, human, point, of, view, and, due, to, the, political, damage, they, caused, making, reference, to, past, trials, in, germany, against, communists, and, socialists, such, as, karl, marx, and, august, bebel, he, claimed, that, the, legal, process, against, him, was, politically, motivated, and, a, show, trial, against, communism, he, stated, that, no, court, lying, in, the, territory, of, west, germany, had, the, legal, right, to, place, him, his, co, defendants, or, any, east, german, citizen, on, trial, and, that, the, portrayal, of, east, germany, as, an, unrechtsstaat, was, contradictory, to, its, recognition, by, over, one, hundred, other, states, and, the, un, security, council, furthermore, he, questioned, how, a, german, court, could, now, legally, judge, his, political, decisions, in, the, light, of, the, lack, of, legal, action, taken, over, various, military, operations, that, had, been, carried, out, by, western, countries, with, either, overt, support, or, absence, of, condemnation, from, west, germany, he, dismissed, public, criticism, of, the, stasi, arguing, that, journalists, in, western, countries, were, praised, for, denouncing, others, while, accepting, political, responsibility, for, the, deaths, at, the, wall, he, believed, he, was, free, of, any, legal, or, moral, guilt, and, thought, that, east, germany, would, go, down, in, history, as, a, sign, that, socialism, is, possible, and, is, better, than, capitalism, by, the, time, of, the, proceedings, honecker, was, already, seriously, ill, a, new, ct, scan, in, august, 1992, had, confirmed, an, ultrasound, examination, made, in, moscow, and, the, existence, of, a, malignant, tumour, in, the, right, lobe, of, his, liver, based, on, these, findings, and, additional, medical, testimonies, honecker, s, lawyers, requested, that, the, legal, proceedings, as, far, as, they, were, aimed, against, their, client, be, abandoned, and, the, arrest, warrant, against, him, withdrawn, the, cases, against, both, mielke, and, stoph, had, already, been, postponed, due, to, their, ill, health, arguing, that, his, life, expectancy, was, estimated, to, be, three, to, six, months, while, the, legal, process, was, forecast, to, take, at, least, two, years, his, lawyers, questioned, whether, it, was, humane, to, try, a, dying, man, their, application, was, rejected, on, 21, december, 1992, when, the, court, concluded, that, given, the, seriousness, of, the, charges, no, obstacle, to, the, proceedings, existed, honecker, lodged, a, constitutional, complaint, to, the, recently, created, constitutional, court, of, the, state, of, berlin, stating, that, the, decision, to, proceed, violated, his, fundamental, right, to, human, dignity, which, was, an, overriding, principle, in, the, constitution, of, berlin, above, even, the, state, penal, system, and, criminal, justice, on, 12, january, 1993, honecker, s, complaint, was, upheld, and, the, berlin, district, court, therefore, abandoned, the, case, and, withdrew, their, arrest, warrant, an, application, for, a, new, arrest, warrant, was, rejected, on, 13, january, the, court, also, refused, to, commence, with, the, trial, related, to, the, indictment, of, 12, november, 1992, and, withdrew, the, second, arrest, warrant, related, to, these, charges, after, a, total, of, 169, days, honecker, was, released, from, custody, drawing, protests, both, from, victims, of, the, east, german, regime, as, well, as, german, political, figures, honecker, flew, via, brazil, to, santiago, chile, to, reunite, with, his, wife, and, his, daughter, sonja, who, lived, there, with, her, son, roberto, upon, his, arrival, he, was, greeted, by, the, leaders, of, the, chilean, communist, and, socialist, parties, in, contrast, his, co, defendants, heinz, kessler, fritz, streletz, and, hans, albrecht, were, sentenced, on, 16, september, 1993, to, imprisonment, of, between, four, and, seven, and, a, half, years, on, 13, april, 1993, a, final, attempt, to, separate, and, continue, the, trial, against, honecker, in, his, absence, was, discontinued, four, days, later, on, the, 66th, birthday, of, his, wife, margot, he, gave, a, final, public, speech, ending, with, the, words, socialism, is, the, opposite, of, what, we, have, now, in, germany, for, that, i, would, like, to, say, that, our, beautiful, memories, of, the, german, democratic, republic, are, testimony, of, a, new, and, just, society, and, we, want, to, always, remain, loyal, to, these, things, honecker, died, on, 29, may, 1994, of, liver, cancer, at, the, age, of, 81, in, a, terraced, house, in, the, la, reina, district, of, santiago, his, funeral,
