edward, iii, 13, november, 1312, 21, june, 1377, also, known, as, edward, of, windsor, before, his, accession, was, king, of, england, from, january, 1327, until, his, death, in, 1377, he, is, noted, for, his, military, success, and, for, restoring, royal, authority, after, the, disastrous, and, unorthodox, reign, of, his, father, edward, ii, edward, iii, transformed, the, kingdom, of, england, into, one, of, the, most, formidable, military, powers, in, europe, his, fifty, year, reign, is, one, of, the, longest, in, english, history, and, saw, vital, developments, in, legislation, and, government, in, particular, the, evolution, of, the, english, parliament, as, well, as, the, ravages, of, the, black, death, he, outlived, his, eldest, son, edward, the, black, prince, and, was, succeeded, by, his, grandson, richard, ii, edward, was, crowned, at, age, fourteen, after, his, father, was, deposed, by, his, mother, isabella, of, france, and, her, lover, roger, mortimer, at, the, age, of, seventeen, he, led, a, successful, coup, d, tat, against, mortimer, the, de, facto, ruler, of, england, and, began, his, personal, reign, after, a, successful, campaign, in, scotland, he, declared, himself, rightful, heir, to, the, french, throne, starting, the, hundred, years, war, 1337, 1453, following, some, initial, setbacks, this, first, phase, of, the, war, went, exceptionally, well, for, england, and, would, become, known, as, the, edwardian, war, victories, at, cr, cy, and, poitiers, in, 1356, led, to, the, highly, favourable, treaty, of, br, tigny, in, which, england, made, territorial, gains, and, edward, renounced, his, claim, to, the, french, throne, edward, s, later, years, were, marked, by, foreign, policy, failure, and, domestic, strife, largely, as, a, result, of, his, decreasing, activity, and, poor, health, edward, was, temperamental, and, thought, himself, capable, of, feats, such, as, healing, by, the, royal, touch, as, some, prior, english, kings, did, he, was, also, capable, of, unusual, clemency, he, was, in, many, ways, a, conventional, medieval, king, whose, main, interest, was, warfare, but, he, also, had, a, broad, range, of, non, military, interests, admired, in, his, own, time, and, for, centuries, after, he, was, later, denounced, as, an, irresponsible, adventurer, by, whig, historians, but, modern, historians, credit, him, with, significant, achievements, king, edward, ii, of, england, had, court, favourites, who, were, unpopular, with, his, nobility, such, as, piers, gaveston, and, hugh, despenser, the, younger, gaveston, was, killed, during, a, noble, rebellion, against, edward, in, 1312, while, despenser, was, hated, by, the, english, nobility, edward, was, also, unpopular, with, the, common, people, due, to, his, repeated, demands, that, they, provide, unpaid, military, service, in, scotland, none, of, his, campaigns, there, were, successful, and, this, led, to, a, further, decline, in, his, popularity, particularly, with, the, nobility, his, image, was, damaged, again, in, 1322, when, he, executed, his, cousin, thomas, earl, of, lancaster, and, confiscated, the, lancaster, estates, historian, chris, given, wilson, wrote, that, by, 1325, the, nobility, believed, that, no, landholder, could, feel, safe, under, the, regime, this, distrust, of, edward, was, shared, by, his, wife, isabella, of, france, who, believed, despenser, responsible, for, poisoning, the, king, s, mind, against, her, in, september, 1324, queen, isabella, was, publicly, humiliated, when, the, government, declared, her, an, enemy, alien, and, the, king, repossessed, her, estates, probably, at, the, urging, of, despenser, edward, also, disbanded, her, retinue, edward, had, already, been, threatened, with, deposition, on, two, previous, occasions, in, 1310, and, 1321, historians, agree, that, hostility, towards, edward, was, universal, w, h, dunham, and, c, t, wood, ascribed, this, to, edward, s, cruelty, and, personal, faults, suggesting, that, very, few, not, even, his, half, brothers, or, his, son, seemed, to, care, about, the, wretched, man, and, that, none, would, fight, for, him, a, contemporary, chronicler, described, edward, as, rex, inutilis, or, a, useless, king, edward, was, born, at, windsor, castle, on, 13, november, 1312, and, was, described, in, a, contemporary, prophecy, as, the, boar, that, would, come, out, of, windsor, the, reign, of, his, father, edward, ii, was, a, particularly, problematic, period, of, english, history, the, king, had, alienated, several, english, nobles, and, scottish, allies, by, abandoning, his, father, s, war, with, scotland, soon, after, his, accession, and, continued, to, lose, battles, against, the, scots, intermittently, also, controversial, was, the, king, s, patronage, of, a, small, group, of, royal, favourites, rather, than, his, nobility, generally, this, says, the, historian, michael, prestwich, unbalanced, the, whole, system, of, royal, patronage, however, the, birth, of, a, male, heir, in, 1312, the, future, edward, iii, soon, improved, edward, ii, s, relations, with, the, french, and, a, moderate, element, within, the, nobility, temporarily, quelled, baronial, opposition, the, young, prince, was, created, earl, of, chester, at, only, twelve, days, old, and, by, january, the, following, year, had, been, provided, with, an, entire, household, an, early, influence, on, prince, edward, was, the, bishop, of, durham, richard, de, bury, one, of, the, century, s, major, bibliophiles, originally, a, tutor, he, appears, to, have, become, a, mentor, to, the, king, under, bury, s, tutelage, edward, learned, to, write, and, to, read, french, and, latin, he, would, have, had, access, to, famous, contemporary, works, such, as, vegetius, s, de, re, militari, which, had, been, translated, into, anglo, norman, as, well, as, the, mirror, for, princes, and, various, psalters, and, religious, texts, since, the, norman, conquest, had, united, the, duchy, of, normandy, and, its, french, estates, with, those, of, the, crown, and, the, land, of, england, english, kings, had, held, several, territories, including, poitou, aquitaine, normandy, anjou, and, maine, and, these, holdings, at, one, point, covering, more, of, france, than, that, held, by, the, french, king, had, frequently, led, to, conflict, in, 1325, edward, ii, was, faced, with, a, demand, from, his, brother, in, law, charles, iv, of, france, to, perform, homage, for, the, english, duchy, of, aquitaine, the, king, was, reluctant, to, leave, the, country, as, discontent, was, once, again, brewing, domestically, particularly, over, his, relationship, with, the, favourite, hugh, despenser, the, younger, instead, he, had, his, son, edward, created, duke, of, aquitaine, in, his, place, and, sent, him, to, france, to, perform, the, homage, the, young, edward, was, accompanied, by, his, mother, isabella, who, was, king, charles, s, sister, and, was, meant, to, negotiate, a, peace, treaty, with, the, french, while, in, france, isabella, conspired, with, the, exiled, roger, mortimer, to, have, edward, ii, deposed, to, build, up, diplomatic, and, military, support, for, the, venture, isabella, had, her, son, engaged, to, the, twelve, year, old, philippa, of, hainault, an, invasion, of, england, was, launched, and, edward, ii, s, forces, deserted, him, completely, isabella, and, mortimer, summoned, a, parliament, and, the, king, was, forced, to, relinquish, the, throne, to, his, son, who, was, proclaimed, king, in, london, on, 25, january, 1327, the, new, king, was, crowned, as, edward, iii, at, westminster, abbey, on, 1, february, at, the, age, of, 14, one, of, edward, s, first, acts, de, facto, mortimer, s, was, to, lead, another, campaign, to, scotland, in, july, 1327, it, was, not, long, before, the, new, reign, also, met, with, other, problems, caused, by, the, central, position, of, mortimer, at, court, who, was, now, the, de, facto, ruler, of, england, mortimer, used, his, position, to, acquire, noble, estates, and, titles, and, his, unpopularity, grew, with, the, humiliating, defeat, by, the, scots, at, the, battle, of, stanhope, park, in, the, county, of, durham, and, the, ensuing, treaty, of, edinburgh, northampton, agreed, with, the, scots, in, 1328, the, young, king, also, came, into, conflict, with, his, guardian, mortimer, knew, his, position, in, relation, to, the, king, was, precarious, and, subjected, edward, to, disrespect, the, king, married, philippa, of, hainault, at, york, minster, on, 24, january, 1328, and, the, birth, of, their, first, child, edward, of, woodstock, on, 15, june, 1330, only, increased, tension, with, mortimer, eventually, the, king, decided, to, take, direct, action, against, mortimer, although, up, until, now, edward, had, kept, a, low, profile, it, is, likely, that, he, increasingly, suspected, that, mortimer, s, behaviour, could, endanger, edward, s, own, life, as, the, former, s, position, became, more, unpopular, this, was, exacerbated, by, his, execution, of, edward, s, uncle, edmund, earl, of, kent, contemporary, chroniclers, suspected, too, that, mortimer, had, designs, on, the, throne, and, it, is, likely, that, it, was, these, rumours, that, encouraged, edward, to, act, against, him, and, his, mother, who, supposedly, maintained, a, close, relationship, with, mortimer, aided, by, his, close, companion, william, montagu, 3rd, baron, montagu, and, a, small, number, of, other, trusted, men, edward, took, mortimer, by, surprise, and, captured, him, at, nottingham, castle, on, 19, october, 1330, mortimer, was, executed, and, edward, s, personal, reign, began, the, historian, mark, ormrod, argued, that, at, this, point, edward, had, had, little, instruction, in, the, art, of, kingship, and, although, he, had, received, several, books, on, the, subject, on, his, betrothal, to, phillipa, it, is, extremely, doubtful, that, he, read, or, comprehended, these, works, his, reign, continues, ormrod, was, to, be, guided, by, his, practical, rather, than, theoretical, experience, edward, iii, was, not, content, with, the, peace, agreement, made, in, his, name, but, the, renewal, of, the, war, with, scotland, originated, in, private, rather, than, royal, initiative, a, group, of, english, magnates, known, as, the, disinherited, who, had, lost, land, in, scotland, by, the, peace, accord, staged, an, invasion, of, scotland, and, won, a, great, victory, at, the, battle, of, dupplin, moor, in, 1332, they, attempted, to, install, edward, balliol, as, king, of, scotland, in, place, of, the, infant, david, ii, but, balliol, was, soon, expelled, and, was, forced, to, seek, the, help, of, edward, iii, the, english, king, responded, by, laying, siege, to, the, important, border, town, of, berwick, and, defeated, a, large, relieving, army, at, the, battle, of, halidon, hill, even, while, under, threat, from, foreign, raids, however, berwick, was, taken, after, the, besieged, scots, set, fire, to, the, town, forcing, them, to, treat, at, one, point, edward, s, queen, was, under, siege, in, bamburgh, castle, but, this, was, too, late, to, save, the, scots, campaign, he, reinstated, balliol, on, the, throne, and, received, a, substantial, amount, of, land, in, southern, scotland, these, victories, proved, hard, to, sustain, as, forces, loyal, to, david, ii, gradually, regained, control, of, the, country, a, scottish, uprising, in, 1344, required, the, raising, of, another, army, and, a, supporting, navy, edward, having, repaired, roxburgh, castle, launched, a, number, of, ineffective, strikes, against, the, scots, in, 1338, edward, agreed, a, truce, with, the, scots, one, reason, for, the, change, of, strategy, towards, scotland, was, a, growing, concern, for, the, relationship, between, england, and, france, as, long, as, scotland, and, france, were, in, an, alliance, the, english, were, faced, with, the, prospect, of, fighting, a, war, on, two, fronts, the, french, carried, out, raids, on, english, coastal, towns, leading, to, rumours, in, england, of, a, full, scale, french, invasion, when, edward, took, power, he, found, his, family, in, complete, disarray, says, ormrod, his, nobility, was, divided, into, factions, after, the, troublesome, reign, of, his, father, and, was, weakened, by, line, failure, among, many, families, while, the, lesser, baronage, was, less, affected, by, political, misadventure, as, their, seniors, they, were, also, weaker, due, to, their, rights, being, more, insubstantive, edward, had, to, pacify, two, noble, parties, one, which, had, been, against, his, father, from, the, beginning, and, another, which, had, opposed, mortimer, s, and, isabella, s, minority, regime, james, bothwell, argues, that, while, he, managed, to, reconcile, the, sides, bloodlessly, and, with, minimum, acrimony, it, was, insufficient, to, leave, him, secure, on, his, own, he, lanced, the, opposition, but, had, not, turned, them, into, a, loyalist, cadre, only, the, earls, of, arundel, oxford, and, warwick, could, be, counted, on, as, loyalists, to, counter, the, limited, loyalty, among, the, aristocrats, following, the, march, 1337, parliament, edward, created, a, duke, and, eight, new, earls, he, also, summoned, 61, new, men, to, the, lords, with, lesser, titles, usually, by, writ, of, summons, over, the, rest, of, his, reign, these, creations, although, expensive, received, very, little, ill, will, among, the, extant, aristocracy, including, the, royal, family, the, 1337, creations, were, hugh, de, audley, to, the, earldom, of, gloucester, william, de, bohun, to, that, of, northampton, william, de, clinton, to, huntingdon, henry, of, grosmont, to, lancaster, william, de, montagu, to, salisbury, and, robert, de, ufford, to, suffolk, of, these, bohun, clinton, montagu, and, ufford, had, played, leading, roles, in, edward, s, coup, against, mortimer, they, were, likewise, the, greatest, beneficiaries, in, terms, of, grants, and, estates, another, common, denominator, was, that, most, of, them, had, also, been, trusted, companions, of, edward, before, the, coup, ufford, for, example, jousted, with, him, and, attended, him, in, his, homage, before, philip, vi, of, france, while, montagu, had, been, his, closest, supporter, and, had, run, secret, diplomatic, missions, to, the, pope, for, him, before, the, coup, james, bothwell, has, noted, that, while, these, men, may, have, been, less, well, off, before, they, were, promoted, they, were, not, less, experienced, either, politically, or, militarily, these, promotions, were, especially, important, to, edward, because, it, had, been, from, among, the, earls, that, his, father, had, created, so, many, bitter, enemies, and, therefore, that, was, the, demography, that, edward, wanted, to, reorganise, in, his, favour, these, promotions, reinforced, his, own, and, the, crown, s, position, and, with, war, approaching, he, created, six, new, recruitment, conduits, from, the, regions, directly, to, the, royal, army, for, the, earls, themselves, the, prospect, was, not, so, positive, due, to, the, parlous, state, of, the, royal, finances, most, of, them, did, not, receive, a, minimum, of, 1000, marks, a, year, that, was, promised, to, them, to, uphold, their, new, estate, all, except, gloucester, had, to, be, satisfied, with, irregular, grants, of, land, to, boost, their, incomes, but, these, would, often, not, be, available, until, the, incumbent, died, and, they, escheated, to, the, king, in, 1337, philip, vi, of, france, confiscated, the, english, king, s, duchy, of, aquitaine, and, the, county, of, ponthieu, instead, of, seeking, a, peaceful, resolution, to, the, conflict, by, paying, homage, to, the, french, king, as, his, father, had, done, edward, responded, by, laying, claim, to, the, french, crown, as, the, grandson, of, philip, iv, of, france, the, french, rejected, this, based, on, the, precedents, for, agnatic, succession, set, in, 1316, and, 1322, and, upheld, the, rights, of, philip, iv, s, nephew, philip, vi, leading, to, tensions, that, caused, the, hundred, years, war, in, the, early, stages, of, the, war, edward, s, strategy, was, to, build, alliances, with, other, continental, rulers, in, 1338, louis, iv, holy, roman, emperor, named, edward, vicar, general, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, promised, his, support, as, late, as, 1373, the, anglo, portuguese, treaty, of, 1373, established, an, anglo, portuguese, alliance, these, measures, produced, few, results, the, only, major, military, victory, during, this, phase, of, the, war, was, the, english, naval, victory, at, sluys, on, 24, june, 1340, which, secured, control, of, the, english, channel, this, victory, decimated, a, superior, french, fleet, and, lowered, the, threat, of, a, french, invasion, of, england, which, increased, english, desires, to, attack, france, this, situation, lasted, less, than, a, year, edward, was, unlikely, to, have, been, happy, with, this, victory, due, to, his, continuing, financial, problems, the, english, also, captured, 166, french, merchantmen, they, had, been, raiding, the, south, coast, of, england, for, several, years, and, were, unpopular, amongst, english, sailors, up, to, 16, 000, french, sailors, were, killed, and, french, captain, nicolas, b, huchet, who, could, otherwise, have, expected, to, be, ransomed, was, hanged, from, his, own, yardarm, edward, saw, god, s, hand, in, his, triumph, and, a, triumphal, coin, was, struck, in, commemoration, showing, edward, in, a, ship, probably, meant, to, be, b, huchet, s, own, and, the, king, s, gained, a, reputation, as, a, naval, warrior, meanwhile, the, fiscal, pressure, on, the, kingdom, caused, by, edward, s, expensive, alliances, led, to, discontent, at, home, the, regency, council, at, home, was, frustrated, by, the, mounting, national, debt, while, the, king, and, his, commanders, on, the, continent, were, angered, by, the, failure, of, the, government, in, england, to, provide, sufficient, funds, to, deal, with, the, situation, edward, himself, returned, to, england, arriving, in, london, unannounced, on, 30, november, 1340, finding, the, affairs, of, the, realm, in, disorder, he, purged, the, royal, administration, of, a, great, number, of, ministers, and, judges, these, measures, did, not, bring, domestic, stability, and, a, stand, off, ensued, between, the, king, and, john, de, stratford, archbishop, of, canterbury, during, which, stratford, s, relatives, robert, stratford, bishop, of, chichester, and, henry, de, stratford, were, temporarily, stripped, of, title, and, imprisoned, respectively, stratford, claimed, that, edward, had, violated, the, laws, of, the, land, by, arresting, royal, officers, a, certain, level, of, conciliation, was, reached, at, the, parliament, of, april, 1341, here, edward, was, forced, to, accept, severe, limitations, to, his, financial, and, administrative, freedom, in, return, for, a, grant, of, taxation, yet, in, october, the, same, year, edward, repudiated, this, statute, and, archbishop, stratford, was, politically, ostracised, the, extraordinary, circumstances, of, the, april, parliament, had, forced, the, king, into, submission, but, under, normal, circumstances, the, powers, of, the, king, in, medieval, england, were, virtually, unlimited, a, fact, that, edward, was, able, to, exploit, historian, nicholas, rodger, called, edward, iii, s, claim, to, be, the, sovereign, of, the, seas, into, question, arguing, there, was, hardly, any, royal, navy, before, the, reign, of, henry, v, 1413, 1422, despite, rodger, s, view, king, john, had, already, developed, a, royal, fleet, of, galleys, and, had, attempted, to, establish, an, administration, for, these, ships, and, others, which, were, arrested, privately, owned, ships, pulled, into, royal, national, service, henry, iii, his, successor, continued, this, work, notwithstanding, the, fact, that, he, along, with, his, predecessor, had, hoped, to, develop, a, strong, and, efficient, naval, administration, their, endeavours, produced, one, that, was, informal, and, mostly, ad, hoc, a, formal, naval, administration, emerged, during, edward, s, reign, comprising, lay, administrators, and, led, by, william, de, clewre, matthew, de, torksey, and, john, de, haytfield, successively, bearing, the, title, of, clerk, of, the, king, s, ships, robert, de, crull, was, the, last, to, fill, this, position, during, edward, iii, s, reign, and, would, have, the, longest, tenure, in, this, position, it, was, during, his, tenure, that, edward, s, naval, administration, would, become, a, base, for, what, evolved, during, the, reigns, of, successors, such, as, henry, viii, s, council, of, marine, and, navy, board, and, charles, i, s, board, of, admiralty, rodger, also, argues, that, for, much, of, the, fourteenth, century, the, french, had, the, upper, hand, apart, from, sluys, in, 1340, and, perhaps, off, winchelsea, in, 1350, yet, the, french, never, invaded, england, and, king, john, ii, of, france, died, in, captivity, in, england, there, was, a, need, for, an, english, navy, to, play, a, role, in, this, and, to, handle, other, matters, such, as, the, insurrection, of, the, anglo, irish, lords, and, acts, of, piracy, edward, s, military, command, structure, began, with, himself, at, the, centre, and, then, members, of, the, court, acted, as, his, generals, this, included, the, king, s, family, and, edward, utilised, the, martial, capabilities, of, his, sons, particularly, his, eldest, son, edward, the, black, prince, this, was, not, only, pragmatic, in, that, they, were, all, good, warriors, but, had, the, added, propaganda, value, of, demonstrating, the, hereditary, nature, of, edward, s, claim, to, the, french, throne, however, command, was, not, always, the, prerogative, of, the, nobility, knights, banneret, knights, able, to, lead, other, knights, were, also, favoured, as, leaders, of, armies, or, divisions, as, they, were, also, already, close, to, the, king, being, part, of, his, household, and, bodyguard, they, bore, particular, responsibilities, during, king, edward, s, chevauch, es, which, often, required, the, main, army, to, split, into, smaller, forces, each, requiring, its, own, captain, this, sometimes, led, to, dissension, for, example, in, the, 1369, loire, campaign, the, earl, of, pembroke, shared, command, with, sir, john, chandos, although, the, latter, was, appointed, seneschal, of, france, by, the, black, prince, pembroke, refused, to, work, beneath, him, on, account, of, his, superior, social, status, ultimately, though, the, task, of, raising, the, armies, that, they, would, lead, fell, to, both, the, aristocracy, could, raise, the, largest, number, of, tenants, and, retainers, after, the, king, but, it, was, the, lower, men, who, acted, as, recruiting, sergeants, in, the, regions, unlike, during, his, father, s, or, great, grandfather, s, campaigns, in, scotland, the, feudal, levy, whereby, military, service, was, provided, for, free, in, exchange, for, land, rights, by, the, outbreak, of, the, hundred, years, war, it, had, become, the, norm, for, men, of, all, ranks, to, be, paid, for, their, service, from, the, king, in, return, the, crown, shouldered, the, responsibility, for, paying, for, the, bulk, of, equipment, the, military, historian, andrew, ayton, has, described, this, transition, as, amounting, to, a, military, revolution, and, one, spearheaded, by, the, king, himself, by, the, early, 1340s, it, was, clear, that, edward, s, policy, of, alliances, was, too, costly, and, yielded, too, few, results, the, following, years, saw, more, direct, involvement, by, english, armies, including, in, the, breton, war, of, succession, but, these, interventions, also, proved, fruitless, at, first, edward, defaulted, on, florentine, loans, of, 1, 365, 000, florins, resulting, in, the, ruin, of, the, lenders, a, change, came, in, july, 1346, when, edward, staged, a, major, offensive, sailing, for, normandy, with, a, force, of, 15, 000, men, his, army, sacked, the, city, of, caen, and, marched, across, northern, france, to, meet, up, with, flemish, forces, in, flanders, it, was, not, edward, s, initial, intention, to, engage, the, french, army, but, at, cr, cy, just, north, of, the, somme, he, found, favourable, terrain, and, decided, to, fight, a, pursuing, army, led, by, philip, vi, on, 26, august, the, english, army, defeated, a, far, larger, french, army, in, the, battle, of, cr, cy, shortly, after, this, on, 17, october, an, english, army, defeated, and, captured, king, david, ii, of, scotland, at, the, battle, of, neville, s, cross, with, his, northern, borders, secured, edward, felt, free, to, continue, his, major, offensive, against, france, laying, siege, to, the, town, of, calais, the, operation, was, the, greatest, english, venture, of, the, hundred, years, war, involving, an, army, of, 32, 000, men, the, siege, started, on, 4, september, 1346, and, lasted, until, the, town, surrendered, on, 3, august, 1347, after, the, fall, of, calais, factors, outside, of, edward, s, control, forced, him, to, wind, down, the, war, effort, in, 1348, the, black, death, struck, england, with, full, force, killing, a, third, or, more, of, the, country, s, population, this, loss, of, manpower, led, to, a, shortage, of, farm, labour, and, a, corresponding, rise, in, wages, the, great, landowners, struggled, with, the, shortage, of, manpower, and, the, resulting, inflation, in, labour, cost, to, curb, the, rise, in, wages, the, king, and, parliament, responded, with, the, ordinance, of, labourers, in, 1349, followed, by, the, statute, of, labourers, in, 1351, these, attempts, to, regulate, wages, could, not, succeed, in, the, long, run, but, in, the, short, term, they, were, enforced, with, great, vigour, all, in, all, the, plague, did, not, lead, to, a, full, scale, breakdown, of, government, and, society, and, recovery, was, remarkably, swift, this, was, to, a, large, extent, thanks, to, the, competent, leadership, of, royal, administrators, such, as, treasurer, william, edington, and, chief, justice, william, de, shareshull, it, was, not, until, the, mid, 1350s, that, military, operations, on, the, continent, were, resumed, on, a, large, scale, in, 1356, edward, s, eldest, son, edward, prince, of, wales, won, an, important, victory, in, the, battle, of, poitiers, the, greatly, outnumbered, english, forces, not, only, routed, the, french, but, captured, the, french, king, john, ii, and, his, youngest, son, philip, after, a, succession, of, victories, the, english, held, great, possessions, in, france, the, french, king, was, in, english, custody, and, the, french, central, government, had, almost, totally, collapsed, there, has, been, a, historical, debate, as, to, whether, edward, s, claim, to, the, french, crown, originally, was, genuine, or, if, it, was, simply, a, political, ploy, meant, to, put, pressure, on, the, french, government, regardless, of, the, original, intent, the, stated, claim, now, seemed, to, be, within, reach, yet, a, campaign, in, 1359, meant, to, complete, the, undertaking, was, inconclusive, in, 1360, therefore, edward, accepted, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, whereby, he, renounced, his, claims, to, the, french, throne, but, secured, his, extended, french, possessions, in, full, sovereignty, edward, kept, his, subjects, fully, informed, of, political, and, military, developments, abroad, by, a, large, number, of, regular, reports, from, himself, and, his, captains, to, various, outlets, including, convocation, the, city, of, london, and, the, archbishops, that, while, the, scholar, a, e, prince, acknowledged, that, taken, singularly, these, reports, may, not, represent, a, cohesive, public, relations, within, government, they, do, perhaps, indicate, as, a, whole, the, existence, of, a, simple, propaganda, organization, with, which, the, king, boosted, domestic, morale, these, then, ended, up, as, part, of, popular, chronicles, either, verbatim, or, in, part, whether, newsletters, or, public, letters, the, middle, years, of, edward, s, reign, were, a, period, of, significant, legislative, activity, perhaps, the, best, known, piece, of, legislation, was, the, statute, of, labourers, of, 1351, which, addressed, the, labour, shortage, problem, caused, by, the, black, death, the, statute, fixed, wages, at, their, pre, plague, level, and, checked, peasant, mobility, by, asserting, that, lords, had, the, first, claim, on, their, men, s, services, in, spite, of, concerted, efforts, to, uphold, the, statute, it, eventually, failed, due, to, competition, among, landowners, for, labour, the, law, has, been, described, as, an, attempt, to, legislate, against, the, law, of, supply, and, demand, which, made, it, doomed, to, fail, nevertheless, the, labour, shortage, had, created, a, community, of, interest, between, the, smaller, landowners, of, the, house, of, commons, and, the, greater, landowners, of, the, house, of, lords, the, resulting, measures, angered, the, peasants, leading, to, the, peasants, revolt, of, 1381, the, reign, of, edward, iii, coincided, with, the, so, called, babylonian, captivity, of, the, papacy, at, avignon, during, the, wars, with, france, opposition, emerged, in, england, against, perceived, injustices, by, a, papacy, largely, controlled, by, the, french, crown, papal, taxation, of, the, english, church, was, suspected, to, be, financing, the, nation, s, enemies, while, the, practice, of, provisions, the, pope, s, providing, benefices, for, clerics, caused, resentment, in, the, english, population, the, statutes, of, provisors, and, praemunire, of, 1350, and, 1353, respectively, aimed, to, amend, this, by, banning, papal, benefices, as, well, as, limiting, the, power, of, the, papal, court, over, english, subjects, the, statutes, did, not, sever, the, ties, between, the, king, and, the, pope, who, were, equally, dependent, upon, each, other, other, legislation, of, importance, includes, the, treason, act, 1351, it, was, precisely, the, harmony, of, the, reign, that, allowed, a, consensus, on, the, definition, of, this, controversial, crime, yet, the, most, significant, legal, reform, was, probably, that, concerning, the, justices, of, the, peace, this, institution, began, before, the, reign, of, edward, iii, but, by, 1350, the, justices, had, been, given, the, power, not, only, to, investigate, crimes, and, make, arrests, but, also, to, try, cases, including, those, of, felony, with, this, an, enduring, fixture, in, the, administration, of, local, english, justice, had, been, created, parliament, as, a, representative, institution, was, already, well, established, by, the, time, of, edward, iii, but, the, reign, was, nevertheless, central, to, its, development, during, this, period, membership, in, the, english, baronage, formerly, a, somewhat, indistinct, group, became, restricted, to, those, who, received, a, personal, summons, to, parliament, this, happened, as, parliament, gradually, developed, into, a, bicameral, institution, composed, of, a, house, of, lords, and, a, house, of, commons, yet, it, was, not, in, the, lords, but, in, the, commons, that, the, greatest, changes, took, place, with, the, expanding, political, role, of, the, commons, informative, is, the, good, parliament, where, the, commons, for, the, first, time, albeit, with, noble, support, were, responsible, for, precipitating, a, political, crisis, in, the, process, both, the, procedure, of, impeachment, and, the, office, of, the, speaker, were, created, even, though, the, political, gains, were, of, only, temporary, duration, this, parliament, represented, a, watershed, in, english, political, history, the, political, influence, of, the, commons, originally, lay, in, their, right, to, grant, taxes, the, financial, demands, of, the, hundred, years, war, were, enormous, and, the, king, and, his, ministers, tried, different, methods, of, covering, the, expenses, edward, had, a, steady, income, from, crown, lands, and, could, also, take, up, substantial, loans, from, italian, and, domestic, financiers, to, finance, warfare, he, had, to, resort, to, taxation, of, his, subjects, taxation, took, two, primary, forms, levy, and, customs, the, levy, was, a, grant, of, a, proportion, of, all, moveable, property, normally, a, tenth, for, towns, and, a, fifteenth, for, farmland, this, could, produce, large, sums, of, money, but, each, such, levy, had, to, be, approved, by, parliament, and, the, king, had, to, prove, the, necessity, the, customs, therefore, provided, a, welcome, supplement, as, a, steady, and, reliable, source, of, income, an, ancient, duty, on, the, export, of, wool, had, existed, since, 1275, edward, i, had, tried, to, introduce, an, additional, duty, on, wool, but, this, unpopular, maltolt, or, unjust, exaction, was, soon, abandoned, then, from, 1336, onwards, a, series, of, schemes, aimed, at, increasing, royal, revenues, from, wool, export, were, introduced, after, some, initial, problems, and, discontent, it, was, agreed, through, the, statute, of, the, staple, of, 1353, that, the, new, customs, should, be, approved, by, parliament, though, in, reality, they, became, permanent, through, the, steady, taxation, of, edward, iii, s, reign, parliament, and, in, particular, the, commons, gained, political, influence, a, consensus, emerged, that, in, order, for, a, tax, to, be, just, the, king, had, to, prove, its, necessity, it, had, to, be, granted, by, the, community, of, the, realm, and, it, had, to, be, to, the, benefit, of, that, community, in, addition, to, imposing, taxes, parliament, would, also, present, petitions, for, redress, of, grievances, to, the, king, most, often, concerning, misgovernment, by, royal, officials, this, way, the, system, was, beneficial, for, both, parties, through, this, process, the, commons, and, the, community, they, represented, became, increasingly, politically, aware, and, the, foundation, was, laid, for, the, particular, english, brand, of, constitutional, monarchy, it, became, the, norm, for, the, king, s, ministers, to, argue, his, case, before, parliament, the, commons, to, grant, the, king, the, tax, he, requested, and, then, the, king, s, concessions, to, parliament, would, be, announced, at, its, end, the, king, occasionally, attempted, to, avoid, resorting, to, parliament, to, raise, taxes, such, as, in, 1338, when, he, attempted, a, forced, loan, on, wool, this, soon, collapsed, in, the, words, of, e, b, fryde, it, was, a, lamentable, failure, and, once, again, edward, had, to, return, to, parliament, edward, also, attempted, to, reinforce, what, he, believed, to, be, his, ancient, rights, such, as, the, return, of, all, goods, and, chattels, of, felons, to, the, crown, and, scutage, as, well, as, new, proposals, such, as, that, debts, should, be, repaid, to, the, crown, in, one, payment, rather, than, incrementally, all, these, schemes, collapsed, however, the, latter, because, the, lords, claimed, that, such, a, method, of, taxation, infringed, upon, their, traditional, rights, according, to, fryde, one, of, edward, s, most, onerous, and, wasteful, liabilities, came, in, february, 1339, when, he, effectively, pawned, the, great, crown, of, england, to, the, archbishop, of, trier, for, which, the, king, promised, repayment, of, 16, 650, edward, met, his, creditors, in, ghent, in, 1340, but, unable, to, immediately, satisfy, their, demands, notes, bertie, wilkinson, pretending, that, he, wanted, to, take, a, walk, he, secretly, rode, away, central, to, edward, iii, s, policy, was, reliance, on, the, higher, nobility, for, purposes, of, war, and, administration, while, edward, ii, had, regularly, been, in, conflict, with, a, great, portion, of, his, peerage, his, son, successfully, created, a, spirit, of, camaraderie, between, himself, and, his, greatest, subjects, both, edward, i, and, edward, ii, had, been, limited, in, their, policy, towards, the, nobility, allowing, the, creation, of, few, new, peerages, during, the, sixty, years, preceding, edward, iii, s, reign, edward, iii, reversed, this, trend, when, in, 1337, as, a, preparation, for, the, imminent, war, he, created, six, new, earls, on, the, same, day, at, the, same, time, edward, expanded, the, ranks, of, the, peerage, upwards, by, introducing, the, new, title, of, duke, for, close, relatives, of, the, king, creating, the, first, three, dukedoms, of, england, cornwall, lancaster, and, clarence, his, eldest, son, edward, the, black, prince, was, created, duke, of, cornwall, the, first, english, duke, in, 1337, in, 1351, the, earl, of, lancaster, was, elevated, to, the, duke, of, lancaster, in, 1362, the, second, son, of, king, edward, iii, lionel, of, antwerp, was, made, the, first, duke, of, clarence, furthermore, edward, bolstered, the, sense, of, community, within, this, group, by, the, creation, of, a, new, order, of, chivalry, in, january, 1344, a, great, feast, was, held, in, windsor, castle, to, which, large, numbers, were, invited, not, just, the, lords, but, the, city, of, london, also, sent, a, contingent, the, first, night, saw, a, feast, at, which, all, the, attending, ladies, with, only, two, knights, among, them, dined, while, the, other, men, ate, in, their, tents, this, was, followed, by, jousting, over, the, next, three, days, where, edward, not, because, of, his, kingly, rank, but, because, of, his, great, exertions, iterates, adam, murimuth, in, his, chronicle, was, deemed, champion, this, was, followed, by, the, king, s, announcement, of, the, founding, of, the, round, table, of, king, arthur, to, which, certain, lords, took, an, oath, the, first, meeting, of, the, new, chapter, was, arranged, for, the, following, whitsun, nothing, however, was, to, come, of, the, project, as, murimuth, comments, this, work, was, later, stopped, for, various, reasons, instead, around, four, years, later, edward, founded, order, of, the, garter, probably, in, 1348, the, new, order, carried, connotations, from, the, legend, by, the, circular, shape, of, the, garter, edward, s, wartime, experiences, during, the, cr, cy, campaign, 1346, 7, seem, to, have, been, a, determining, factor, in, his, abandonment, of, the, round, table, project, it, has, been, argued, that, the, total, warfare, tactics, employed, by, the, english, at, cr, cy, in, 1346, were, contrary, to, arthurian, ideals, and, made, arthur, a, problematic, paradigm, for, edward, especially, at, the, time, of, the, institution, of, the, garter, there, are, no, formal, references, to, king, arthur, and, the, round, table, in, the, surviving, early, fifteenth, century, copies, of, the, statutes, of, the, garter, but, the, garter, feast, of, 1358, did, involve, a, round, table, game, thus, there, was, some, overlap, between, the, projected, round, table, fellowship, and, the, actualized, order, of, the, garter, polydore, vergil, tells, of, how, the, young, joan, of, kent, allegedly, the, king, s, favourite, at, the, time, accidentally, dropped, her, garter, at, a, ball, at, calais, edward, responded, to, the, ensuing, ridicule, of, the, crowd, by, tying, the, garter, around, his, own, knee, with, the, words, honi, soit, qui, mal, y, pense, shame, on, him, who, thinks, ill, of, it, this, reinforcement, of, the, aristocracy, and, the, emerging, sense, of, national, identity, must, be, seen, in, conjunction, with, the, war, in, france, just, as, the, war, with, scotland, had, done, the, fear, of, a, french, invasion, helped, strengthen, a, sense, of, national, unity, and, nationalise, the, aristocracy, that, had, been, largely, anglo, norman, since, the, norman, conquest, since, the, time, of, edward, i, popular, myth, suggested, that, the, french, planned, to, extinguish, the, english, language, and, as, his, grandfather, had, done, edward, iii, made, the, most, of, this, scare, as, a, result, the, english, language, experienced, a, strong, revival, in, 1362, a, statute, of, pleading, ordered, english, to, be, used, in, law, courts, and, the, year, after, parliament, was, for, the, first, time, opened, in, english, at, the, same, time, the, vernacular, saw, a, revival, as, a, literary, language, through, the, works, of, william, langland, john, gower, and, especially, the, canterbury, tales, by, geoffrey, chaucer, yet, the, extent, of, this, anglicisation, must, not, be, exaggerated, the, statute, of, 1362, was, in, fact, written, in, the, french, language, and, had, little, immediate, effect, and, parliament, was, opened, in, that, language, as, late, as, 1377, the, order, of, the, garter, though, a, distinctly, english, institution, included, also, foreign, members, such, as, john, iv, duke, of, brittany, and, robert, of, namur, while, edward, s, early, reign, had, been, energetic, and, successful, his, later, years, were, marked, by, inertia, military, failure, and, political, strife, the, day, to, day, affairs, of, the, state, had, less, appeal, to, edward, than, military, campaigning, so, during, the, 1360s, edward, increasingly, relied, on, the, help, of, his, subordinates, in, particular, william, wykeham, a, relative, upstart, wykeham, was, made, keeper, of, the, privy, seal, in, 1363, and, chancellor, in, 1367, though, due, to, political, difficulties, connected, with, his, inexperience, the, parliament, forced, him, to, resign, the, chancellorship, in, 1371, compounding, edward, s, difficulties, were, the, deaths, of, his, most, trusted, men, some, from, the, 1361, 62, recurrence, of, the, plague, william, montagu, 1st, earl, of, salisbury, edward, s, companion, in, the, 1330, coup, died, as, early, as, 1344, william, de, clinton, 1st, earl, of, huntingdon, who, had, also, been, with, edward, at, nottingham, died, in, 1354, one, of, the, earls, created, in, 1337, william, de, bohun, 1st, earl, of, northampton, died, in, 1360, and, the, next, year, henry, of, grosmont, duke, of, lancaster, perhaps, the, greatest, of, edward, s, captains, succumbed, to, what, was, probably, plague, their, deaths, left, the, majority, of, the, magnates, younger, and, more, naturally, aligned, to, the, princes, than, to, the, king, himself, increasingly, edward, began, to, rely, on, his, sons, for, the, leadership, of, military, operations, the, king, s, second, son, lionel, of, antwerp, attempted, to, subdue, by, force, the, largely, autonomous, anglo, irish, lords, in, ireland, the, venture, failed, and, the, only, lasting, mark, he, left, was, the, suppressive, statutes, of, kilkenny, in, 1366, in, france, meanwhile, the, decade, following, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, was, one, of, relative, tranquillity, but, on, 8, april, 1364, john, ii, died, in, captivity, in, england, after, unsuccessfully, trying, to, raise, his, own, ransom, at, home, he, was, followed, by, the, vigorous, charles, v, who, enlisted, the, help, of, the, capable, bertrand, du, guesclin, constable, of, france, in, 1369, the, french, war, started, anew, and, edward, s, son, john, of, gaunt, was, given, the, responsibility, of, a, military, campaign, the, effort, failed, and, with, the, treaty, of, bruges, in, 1375, the, great, english, possessions, in, france, were, reduced, to, only, the, coastal, towns, of, calais, bordeaux, and, bayonne, alice, perrers, was, originally, one, of, philippa, s, household, ladies, having, been, appointed, by, 1359, within, five, years, by, which, time, she, would, have, been, 18, and, after, the, death, of, her, husband, she, is, speculated, to, have, become, the, lover, of, the, elderly, king, she, maintained, an, active, business, life, outside, her, career, in, the, royal, household, particularly, as, a, moneylender, while, also, making, the, most, out, of, her, royal, connections, accepted, gifts, from, courtiers, and, those, wishing, to, further, their, causes, with, the, king, edward, presented, her, with, gifts, including, land, manors, and, jewels, and, in, 1371, these, included, those, of, the, now, dead, philippa, alice, in, what, may, have, been, an, attempt, to, keep, her, new, estates, after, the, king, s, death, tied, them, up, in, a, series, of, enfeoffments, this, meant, that, legally, they, ceased, to, be, royal, gifts, which, could, be, resumed, to, the, crown, but, hers, to, receive, from, her, feoffees, when, she, chose, these, gifts, included, 50, manors, in, 25, counties, and, 20, 000, in, jewels, the, contemporary, chronicler, thomas, walsingham, saw, her, as, a, low, born, woman, who, through, her, own, ambition, made, a, fortune, from, the, besotted, king, and, this, was, the, popular, view, presented, to, the, good, parliament, of, 1376, in, which, she, was, also, accused, of, taking, 2000, to, 3000, pounds, in, gold, and, silver, per, annum, from, the, royal, treasury, another, contemporary, the, anonimalle, chronicler, complained, that, this, was, all, without, any, notable, profit, and, in, great, damage, to, our, lord, the, king, and, argued, that, alice, be, removed, from, the, king, s, circle, even, though, he, was, still, living, albeit, known, to, be, dying, modern, historians, have, credited, her, with, more, agency, than, merely, using, womanly, wiles, to, get, her, own, way, noting, her, head, for, business, and, the, law, bothwell, also, notes, that, she, probably, recognised, the, precariousness, of, her, own, position, after, the, king, had, died, which, it, was, obvious, to, all, in, the, 1370s, was, imminent, and, intended, much, of, her, wealth, to, provide, for, her, two, daughters, whose, lives, would, be, even, more, precarious, in, the, following, reign, she, was, correct, in, her, surmise, by, the, time, the, good, parliament, met, edward, was, too, weak, but, to, acquiesce, in, her, banishment, this, did, not, however, last, very, long, she, had, returned, to, his, inner, circle, later, that, year, and, remained, there, until, his, death, however, in, 1378, her, previous, fears, resurfaced, and, this, time, put, on, trial, before, parliament, in, the, first, year, of, richard, ii, s, reign, she, was, found, guilty, and, sentenced, to, be, exiled, further, her, property, was, forfeited, to, the, crown, military, failure, abroad, and, the, associated, fiscal, pressure, of, constant, campaigns, led, to, political, discontent, in, england, finance, was, a, particular, grievance, although, it, was, rarely, raised, as, an, issue, before, 1371, after, that, time, complaints, about, the, royal, household, s, expenditure, were, frequent, the, problems, came, to, a, head, in, the, parliament, of, 1376, the, so, called, good, parliament, the, parliament, was, called, to, grant, taxation, but, the, house, of, commons, took, the, opportunity, to, address, specific, grievances, in, particular, criticism, was, directed, at, some, of, the, king, s, closest, advisors, lord, chamberlain, william, latimer, 4th, baron, latimer, and, steward, of, the, household, john, neville, 3rd, baron, neville, de, raby, were, dismissed, from, their, positions, edward, iii, s, mistress, alice, perrers, who, was, seen, to, hold, far, too, much, power, over, the, ageing, king, was, banished, from, court, yet, the, real, adversary, of, the, commons, supported, by, powerful, men, such, as, wykeham, and, edmund, mortimer, 3rd, earl, of, march, was, john, of, gaunt, both, the, king, and, edward, of, woodstock, were, by, this, time, incapacitated, by, illness, leaving, gaunt, in, virtual, control, of, government, gaunt, was, forced, to, give, in, to, the, demands, of, parliament, but, at, its, next, convocation, in, 1377, most, of, the, achievements, of, the, good, parliament, were, reversed, edward, iii, did, not, have, much, to, do, with, any, of, this, after, around, 1375, he, played, a, limited, role, in, the, government, of, the, realm, around, 29, september, 1376, he, fell, ill, with, a, large, abscess, after, a, brief, period, of, recovery, in, february, 1377, the, king, died, of, a, stroke, at, sheen, on, 21, june, edward, iii, was, succeeded, by, his, ten, year, old, grandson, king, richard, ii, son, of, edward, of, woodstock, since, woodstock, himself, had, died, on, 8, june, 1376, in, 1376, edward, had, signed, letters, patent, on, the, order, of, succession, to, the, crown, citing, in, second, position, his, third, son, john, of, gaunt, but, ignoring, philippa, daughter, of, his, second, son, lionel, of, antwerp, duke, of, clarence, philippa, s, exclusion, contrasted, with, a, decision, by, edward, i, in, 1290, which, had, recognized, the, right, of, women, to, inherit, the, crown, and, to, pass, it, on, to, their, descendants, the, order, of, succession, determined, in, 1376, led, the, house, of, lancaster, to, the, throne, in, 1399, john, of, gaunt, was, duke, of, lancaster, whereas, the, rule, decided, by, edward, i, would, have, favoured, philippa, s, descendants, among, them, the, house, of, york, beginning, with, richard, of, york, her, great, grandson, the, large, number, of, cousins, that, were, created, is, sometimes, argued, to, have, laid, the, foundations, for, the, wars, of, the, roses, in, the, fifteenth, century, edward, iii, and, his, wife, philippa, had, eight, sons, and, five, daughters, born, over, a, 25, year, period, this, was, considered, a, success, by, contemporaries, and, a, sign, of, god, s, favour, edward, understood, the, importance, of, a, strong, and, united, royal, family, argues, ormrod, it, allowed, him, through, their, marriages, to, make, alliances, within, his, own, aristocracy, and, also, with, continental, dynasties, however, the, latter, policy, gradually, fell, apart, with, the, gradual, loss, of, england, s, european, possessions, towards, the, end, of, the, century, for, example, he, organised, the, marriage, of, his, sister, eleanor, of, woodstock, to, the, count, of, guelders, as, part, of, a, pro, netherlandish, anti, french, policy, in, 1332, yet, when, the, coalition, collapsed, in, 1340, the, fact, that, he, had, only, lost, her, in, that, particular, marriage, market, was, a, positive, from, around, this, time, says, ormrod, the, hundred, years, war, became, a, family, enterprise, the, edward, the, black, prince, commanded, a, force, at, cr, cy, and, ten, years, later, his, younger, brothers, lionel, john, and, edmund, had, joined, the, war, however, while, his, sons, were, fighting, in, france, they, could, not, be, procreating, the, royal, line, by, 1358, only, lionel, had, married, and, provided, edward, with, a, grandchild, by, the, mid, 1360s, his, family, had, furthered, his, continental, policy, both, diplomatically, and, militarily, sufficiently, that, he, allowed, his, son, edward, and, his, daughter, isabella, to, do, that, rarest, of, things, in, the, middle, ages, marry, for, love, neither, the, former, s, match, with, joan, of, kent, and, the, latter, s, to, enguerrand, vii, de, coucy, were, particularly, advantageous, to, the, king, the, first, was, a, clandestine, marriage, while, de, courcy, was, a, french, hostage, ormrod, concludes, that, by, 1376, edward, iii, s, greatest, misfortune, was, that, he, lived, long, enough, to, witness, the, complete, collapse, of, elaborate, dynastic, plan, by, 1377, the, king, s, family, had, been, depleted, his, territories, reduced, his, diplomacy, wrecked, and, his, own, control, of, affairs, nullified, a, fourth, son, thomas, of, windsor, is, also, sometimes, posited, as, being, born, in, 1347, and, dying, the, following, year, however, the, historian, kathryn, warner, has, suggested, that, as, william, of, woodstock, was, also, born, and, died, the, same, year, and, combined, with, the, paucity, of, material, evidence, it, is, likely, that, this, thomas, is, a, composite, she, argues, that, the, entire, existence, of, thomas, of, windsor, in, some, modern, books, and, websites, appears, to, be, based, on, the, spurious, story, by, two, chroniclers, that, philippa, was, heavily, pregnant, when, she, interceded, for, the, calais, burghers, in, early, august, 1347, she, also, notes, that, for, william, who, also, died, young, there, is, much, evidence, for, his, existence, including, his, funeral, or, tomb, or, for, the, queen, s, purification, after, his, birth, or, for, any, kind, of, celebration, held, to, mark, the, birth, of, another, royal, child, the, medievalist, nicholas, orme, has, noted, that, medieval, chroniclers, were, particularly, accurate, when, it, came, to, recording, royal, births, the, geneticist, adam, rutherford, has, calculated, edward, had, over, 300, great, great, grandchildren, and, therefore, over, 20, 000, descendants, by, 1600, thus, by, the, 21st, century, it, is, virtually, impossible, that, a, person, with, a, predominantly, british, ancestry, is, not, descended, from, edward, iii, as, they, would, have, around, 32, 000, ancestors, from, 1600, conversely, rutherford, has, calculated, that, statistically, the, odds, on, a, 20th, century, british, person, not, being, descended, from, edward, iii, is, 0, 995, 32, 768, 4, 64, 10, 72, mark, ormrod, has, noted, that, in, this, period, politics, was, often, dictated, by, the, personality, and, character, of, the, king, however, it, was, also, understood, that, not, only, should, a, king, rule, well, and, wisely, but, that, he, should, be, seen, to, do, so, ormrod, argues, that, while, he, did, not, begin, his, reign, with, these, skills, unlike, many, of, his, fellow, plantagenet, kings, he, acquired, them, his, collection, of, chronicles, indicates, an, interest, in, history, even, to, the, extent, that, on, occasion, he, consulted, their, authors, he, may, have, been, particularly, keen, to, emulate, henry, ii, and, edward, i, whose, own, martial, prowess, and, success, would, have, resonated, with, him, his, tastes, were, conventional, ormrod, says, and, j, r, lander, also, has, argued, that, this, is, reflected, in, his, hobbies, unlike, his, father, s, passion, for, manual, work, including, carpentry, thatching, and, rowing, edward, iii, shared, to, the, full, the, conventional, tastes, and, pleasure, of, the, aristocracy, with, his, principal, interest, being, architecture, this, conservativism, is, also, reflected, in, his, religious, views, which, expressed, as, they, were, through, the, patronage, of, friaries, and, visiting, of, shrines, demonstrate, a, conventional, religion, this, is, also, reflected, in, his, almsgiving, while, ancestors, such, as, henry, iii, had, often, been, haphazard, and, exuberant, in, the, amounts, they, gave, and, when, they, did, so, edward, iii, maintained, a, regular, 366, meals, a, week, to, be, provided, for, the, poor, with, another, 25, to, be, distributed, during, the, four, main, feasts, however, alongside, his, conventionality, ran, a, populist, streak, and, ormrod, has, described, him, as, a, natural, showman, particularly, in, his, alacrity, to, heal, those, suffering, from, scrofula, by, his, royal, touch, in, less, than, two, years, between, 1338, and, 1340, he, touched, for, scrofula, in, both, england, and, while, campaigning, in, france, another, 355, occurred, between, november, 1340, and, the, same, month, the, following, year, he, was, generous, to, the, point, of, extravagance, in, an, alternative, view, norman, cantor, has, described, edward, as, an, avaricious, and, sadistic, thug, from, what, is, known, of, edward, s, character, he, could, be, impulsive, and, temperamental, as, was, seen, by, his, actions, against, stratford, and, the, ministers, in, 1340, 41, other, escapades, were, not, just, impulsive, but, dangerous, such, as, in, 1349, when, he, sailed, to, calais, with, only, a, small, bodyguard, at, the, same, time, he, was, well, known, for, his, clemency, mortimer, s, grandson, was, not, only, absolved, he, came, to, play, an, important, part, in, the, french, wars, and, was, eventually, made, a, knight, of, the, garter, his, favourite, pursuit, was, the, art, of, war, and, in, this, he, conformed, to, the, medieval, notion, of, good, kingship, as, a, warrior, he, was, so, successful, that, one, modern, military, historian, has, described, him, as, the, greatest, general, in, english, history, he, seems, to, have, been, unusually, devoted, to, queen, philippa, much, has, been, made, of, edward, s, sexual, licentiousness, but, there, is, no, evidence, of, any, infidelity, on, his, part, before, alice, perrers, became, his, lover, and, by, that, time, the, queen, was, already, terminally, ill, this, devotion, extended, to, the, rest, of, the, family, as, well, in, contrast, to, many, of, his, predecessors, edward, never, experienced, opposition, from, any, of, his, five, adult, sons, edward, iii, argues, the, scholar, michael, a, r, graves, left, a, dual, legacy, these, were, the, large, brood, of, children, and, grandchildren, he, left, and, his, claim, to, the, french, throne, in, the, first, instance, his, endowment, of, his, sons, as, dukes, of, clarence, lancaster, and, york, allowed, them, to, create, their, own, dynasties, which, were, both, part, of, the, royal, family, and, the, aristocracy, which, following, henry, bolingbroke, s, usurpation, of, edward, s, grandson, richard, ii, bedevilled, the, lancastrian, dynasty, secondly, while, the, resumption, of, edward, s, claims, and, war, in, france, was, initially, successful, contemporaries, compared, henry, v, s, decisive, victory, at, agincourt, with, edward, s, at, cr, cy, and, poitiers, when, the, tide, turned, against, the, english, in, france, the, dynasty, was, also, weakened, indeed, war, in, france, was, problematic, for, the, house, of, york, as, well, as, lancaster, edward, iv, was, probably, consciously, following, in, his, namesake, s, footsteps, when, he, invaded, france, in, 1475, even, if, the, subsequent, treaty, of, picquigny, was, wholly, unintended, edward, iv, s, reign, looked, back, on, that, of, edward, iii, with, its, martial, and, administrative, progress, as, something, to, model, their, own, on, argues, morgan, edward, iv, s, own, household, books, summarise, the, approach, as, we, take, to, bylde, upon, a, more, perfit, new, house, and, indeed, many, of, their, grants, and, warrants, contain, a, final, clause, that, whatever, was, under, discussion, should, be, as, they, were, in, edward, iii, s, final, year, even, the, final, destruction, of, the, plantagenets, at, bosworth, in, 1485, failed, to, impinge, on, edward, iii, s, posthumous, image, he, was, also, the, most, recent, king, henry, vii, could, lay, claim, of, descent, from, edward, iii, enjoyed, unprecedented, popularity, in, his, own, lifetime, and, even, the, troubles, of, his, later, reign, were, never, blamed, directly, on, the, king, himself, his, contemporary, jean, froissart, wrote, in, his, chronicles, his, like, had, not, been, seen, since, the, days, of, king, arthur, d, a, l, morgan, has, drawn, attention, to, the, continuing, popularity, of, edward, into, the, next, century, observing, that, by, 1500, edward, iii, was, well, into, his, stride, as, the, greatest, king, ever, to, have, ruled, england, quoting, the, great, chronicle, of, london, on, henry, vii, who, if, not, for, his, avarice, mygth, have, been, pereless, of, alle, princis, that, regnyd, ovyr, england, syne, the, tyme, of, edwardthe, thyrd, this, view, persisted, for, a, while, but, with, time, edward, s, image, changed, the, whig, historians, of, a, later, age, preferred, constitutional, reform, to, foreign, conquest, and, accused, edward, of, ignoring, his, responsibilities, to, his, own, nation, bishop, stubbs, in, his, the, constitutional, history, of, england, states, edward, iii, was, not, a, statesman, though, he, possessed, some, qualifications, which, might, have, made, him, a, successful, one, he, was, a, warrior, ambitious, unscrupulous, selfish, extravagant, and, ostentatious, his, obligations, as, a, king, sat, very, lightly, on, him, he, felt, himself, bound, by, no, special, duty, either, to, maintain, the, theory, of, royal, supremacy, or, to, follow, a, policy, which, would, benefit, his, people, like, richard, i, he, valued, england, primarily, as, a, source, of, supplies, this, view, has, been, challenged, through, most, of, the, 20th, century, and, ormrod, has, observed, that, no, modern, reader, could, seriously, accept, all, these, compliments, at, face, value, although, also, that, in, their, efforts, to, counter, the, prevailing, hagiography, early, 20th, century, historians, were, more, critical, edward, iii, is, now, often, seen, as, a, rather, second, rate, ruler, stubborn, and, selfish, in, his, foreign, ambitions, weak, and, yielding, in, his, domestic, policies, he, lacked, the, forcefulness, of, henry, ii, the, statesmanship, of, edward, i, the, charisma, of, henry, v, or, the, application, of, henry, vii, he, was, prepared, to, accept, short, term, compromises, and, to, ignore, the, wider, implications, of, his, actions, later, scholarship, suggests, ormrod, tended, to, be, rather, kinder, in, a, 1960, article, may, mckisack, points, out, the, teleological, nature, of, stubbs, judgement, a, medieval, king, could, not, be, expected, to, work, towards, some, future, ideal, of, a, parliamentary, monarchy, as, if, it, were, good, in, itself, rather, his, role, was, a, pragmatic, one, to, maintain, order, and, solve, problems, as, they, arose, at, this, edward, excelled, edward, had, also, been, accused, of, endowing, his, younger, sons, too, liberally, and, thereby, promoting, dynastic, strife, culminating, in, the, wars, of, the, roses, this, claim, was, rejected, by, k, b, mcfarlane, who, argued, that, this, was, not, only, the, common, policy, of, the, age, but, also, the, best, later, biographers, of, edward, such, as, mark, ormrod, and, ian, mortimer, have, followed, this, historiographical, trend, the, older, negative, view, has, not, completely, disappeared, cantor, has, argued, that, edward, was, a, destructive, and, merciless, force, ormrod, argues, that, in, overturning, the, stubbsian, paradigm, historians, may, have, gone, too, far, in, the, opposite, direction, not, taking, into, account, the, problems, he, had, to, solve, and, the, number, of, different, factions, he, had, to, accommodate, to, get, things, done, chris, given, wilson, and, michael, prestwich, in, their, introduction, to, the, proceedings, of, the, 1999, centre, for, medieval, studies, conference, at, the, university, of, york, summarise, modern, consensus, as, being, effectively, that, he, was, overall, a, strong, king, a, just, king, and, a, good, warrior, and, strategist, basically, a, good, king, for, the, time, this, they, argue, is, the, most, important, point, regarding, modern, scholarship, on, edward, iii, not, necessarily, to, overturn, previous, consensus, but, to, look, at, all, aspects, of, a, multi, faceted, king, and, examine, how, he, achieved, this, success, modern, historians, are, also, more, distant, than, contemporaries, in, their, view, of, the, king, s, fecundity, being, a, sign, of, success, more, often, it, is, seen, as, a, liability, as, each, mouth, had, to, be, paid, for, draining, limited, resources, further, it, may, have, led, to, later, partisanship, between, the, crown, and, its, cadet, branches, edward, s, grandson, the, young, richard, ii, faced, political, and, economic, problems, many, resulting, from, the, black, death, including, the, peasants, revolt, that, broke, out, across, the, south, of, england, in, 1381, over, the, coming, decades, richard, and, groups, of, nobles, vied, for, power, and, control, of, policy, towards, france, until, henry, of, bolingbroke, seized, the, throne, with, the, support, of, parliament, in, 1399, ruling, as, henry, iv, he, exercised, power, through, a, royal, council, and, parliament, while, attempting, to, enforce, political, and, religious, conformity, his, son, henry, v, reinvigorated, the, war, with, france, and, came, close, to, achieving, strategic, success, shortly, before, his, death, in, 1422, henry, vi, became, king, at, the, age, of, only, nine, months, and, both, the, english, political, system, and, the, military, situation, in, france, began, to, unravel, a, sequence, of, bloody, civil, wars, later, termed, the, wars, of, the, roses, erupted, in, 1455, spurred, on, by, an, economic, crisis, and, a, widespread, perception, of, poor, government, the, idea, that, edward, iii, was, to, blame, for, the, later, 15th, century, wars, of, the, roses, was, prevalent, as, late, as, the, 19th, century, but, came, to, be, challenged, in, the, 20th
