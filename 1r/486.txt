attributed, to, typhoid, fever, but, believed, by, some, historians, to, be, syphilis, appreciation, of, schubert, s, music, while, he, was, alive, was, limited, to, a, relatively, small, circle, of, admirers, in, vienna, but, interest, in, his, work, increased, greatly, in, the, decades, following, his, death, felix, mendelssohn, robert, schumann, franz, liszt, johannes, brahms, and, other, 19th, century, composers, discovered, and, championed, his, works, today, schubert, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, composers, in, the, history, of, western, classical, music, and, his, music, continues, to, be, widely, performed, franz, peter, schubert, was, born, in, himmelpfortgrund, now, a, part, of, alsergrund, vienna, archduchy, of, austria, on, 31, january, 1797, and, baptized, in, the, catholic, church, the, following, day, he, was, the, twelfth, child, of, franz, theodor, florian, schubert, 1763, 1830, and, maria, elisabeth, katharina, vietz, 1756, 1812, schubert, s, immediate, ancestors, came, originally, from, the, province, of, zuckmantel, in, austrian, silesia, his, father, the, son, of, a, moravian, peasant, was, a, well, known, parish, schoolmaster, and, his, school, in, lichtental, in, vienna, s, ninth, district, had, numerous, students, in, attendance, he, came, to, vienna, from, zukmantel, in, 1784, and, was, appointed, schoolmaster, two, years, later, his, mother, was, the, daughter, of, a, silesian, master, locksmith, and, had, been, a, housemaid, for, a, viennese, family, before, marriage, of, franz, theodor, and, elisabeth, s, fourteen, children, one, of, them, illegitimate, born, in, 1783, nine, died, in, infancy, at, the, age, of, five, schubert, began, to, receive, regular, lessons, from, his, father, and, a, year, later, he, was, enrolled, at, his, father, s, school, although, it, is, not, known, exactly, when, he, received, his, first, musical, instruction, he, was, given, piano, lessons, by, his, brother, ignaz, but, they, lasted, for, a, very, short, time, as, schubert, excelled, him, within, a, few, months, ignaz, later, recalled, i, was, amazed, when, franz, told, me, a, few, months, after, we, began, that, he, had, no, need, of, any, further, instruction, from, me, and, that, for, the, future, he, would, make, his, own, way, and, in, truth, his, progress, in, a, short, period, was, so, great, that, i, was, forced, to, acknowledge, in, him, a, master, who, had, completely, distanced, and, outstripped, me, and, whom, i, despaired, of, overtaking, his, father, gave, him, his, first, violin, lessons, when, he, was, eight, years, old, training, him, to, the, point, where, he, could, play, easy, duets, proficiently, soon, after, schubert, was, given, his, first, lessons, outside, the, family, by, michael, holzer, organist, and, choirmaster, of, the, local, parish, church, in, lichtental, holzer, would, often, assure, schubert, s, father, with, tears, in, his, eyes, that, he, had, never, had, such, a, pupil, as, schubert, and, the, lessons, may, have, largely, consisted, of, conversations, and, expressions, of, admiration, holzer, gave, the, young, schubert, instruction, in, piano, and, organ, as, well, as, in, figured, bass, according, to, holzer, however, he, did, not, give, him, any, real, instruction, as, schubert, would, already, know, anything, that, he, tried, to, teach, him, rather, he, looked, upon, schubert, with, astonishment, and, silence, the, boy, seemed, to, gain, more, from, an, acquaintance, with, a, friendly, apprentice, joiner, who, took, him, to, a, neighbouring, pianoforte, warehouse, where, schubert, could, practise, on, better, instruments, he, also, played, viola, in, the, family, string, quartet, with, his, brothers, ferdinand, and, ignaz, on, first, and, second, violin, and, his, father, on, the, cello, schubert, wrote, his, earliest, string, quartets, for, this, ensemble, young, schubert, first, came, to, the, attention, of, antonio, salieri, then, vienna, s, leading, musical, authority, in, 1804, when, his, vocal, talent, was, recognized, in, november, 1808, he, became, a, pupil, at, the, stadtkonvikt, imperial, seminary, through, a, choir, scholarship, at, the, stadtkonvikt, he, was, introduced, to, the, overtures, and, symphonies, of, mozart, the, symphonies, of, joseph, haydn, and, his, younger, brother, michael, haydn, and, the, overtures, and, symphonies, of, beethoven, a, composer, for, whom, he, developed, admiration, his, exposure, to, these, and, other, works, combined, with, occasional, visits, to, the, opera, laid, the, foundation, for, a, broader, musical, education, one, important, musical, influence, came, from, the, songs, by, johann, rudolf, zumsteeg, an, important, composer, of, lieder, the, precocious, young, student, wanted, to, modernize, zumsteeg, s, songs, as, reported, by, joseph, von, spaun, schubert, s, friend, schubert, s, friendship, with, spaun, began, at, the, stadtkonvikt, and, lasted, throughout, his, short, life, in, those, early, days, the, financially, well, off, spaun, furnished, the, impoverished, schubert, with, much, of, his, manuscript, paper, in, the, meantime, schubert, s, talent, began, to, show, in, his, compositions, salieri, decided, to, start, training, him, privately, in, music, theory, and, composition, according, to, ferdinand, the, boy, s, first, composition, for, piano, was, a, fantasy, for, four, hands, his, first, song, klagegesang, der, hagar, was, written, a, year, later, schubert, was, occasionally, permitted, to, lead, the, stadtkonvikt, s, orchestra, the, first, orchestra, he, wrote, for, he, devoted, much, of, the, rest, of, his, time, at, the, stadtkonvikt, to, composing, chamber, music, several, songs, piano, pieces, and, more, ambitiously, liturgical, choral, works, in, the, form, of, a, salve, regina, d, 27, a, kyrie, d, 31, in, addition, to, the, unfinished, octet, for, winds, d, 72, said, to, commemorate, the, 1812, death, of, his, mother, the, cantata, wer, ist, gro, for, male, voices, and, orchestra, d, 110, for, his, father, s, birthday, in, 1813, and, his, first, symphony, d, 82, at, the, end, of, 1813, schubert, left, the, stadtkonvikt, and, returned, home, for, teacher, training, at, the, st, anna, normal, hauptschule, in, 1814, he, entered, his, father, s, school, as, the, teacher, of, the, youngest, pupils, for, over, two, years, young, schubert, endured, severe, drudgery, however, he, found, compensatory, interests, during, this, time, for, example, schubert, continued, to, take, private, lessons, in, composition, from, salieri, who, provided, him, with, more, technical, training, than, any, of, his, other, teachers, until, they, parted, ways, in, 1817, in, 1814, schubert, met, a, young, soprano, named, therese, grob, daughter, of, a, local, silk, manufacturer, and, wrote, several, of, his, liturgical, works, including, a, salve, regina, and, a, tantum, ergo, for, her, she, was, also, a, soloist, in, the, premiere, of, his, mass, no, 1, d, 105, in, september, 1814, schubert, wanted, to, marry, her, but, was, hindered, by, the, harsh, marriage, consent, law, of, 1815, requiring, an, aspiring, bridegroom, to, show, he, had, the, means, to, support, a, family, in, november, 1816, after, failing, to, gain, a, musical, post, in, laibach, now, ljubljana, slovenia, schubert, sent, ms, grob, s, brother, heinrich, a, collection, of, songs, which, was, retained, by, the, family, into, the, twentieth, century, one, of, schubert, s, most, prolific, years, was, 1815, he, composed, over, 20, 000, bars, of, music, more, than, half, of, which, were, for, orchestra, including, nine, church, works, although, he, was, an, agnostic, a, symphony, and, about, 140, lieder, in, that, year, he, was, also, introduced, to, anselm, h, ttenbrenner, and, franz, von, schober, who, would, become, his, lifelong, friends, another, friend, johann, mayrhofer, was, introduced, to, him, by, spaun, in, 1815, throughout, 1815, schubert, lived, at, home, with, his, father, he, continued, to, teach, at, the, school, and, give, private, musical, instruction, earning, enough, money, for, his, basic, needs, including, clothing, manuscript, paper, pens, and, ink, but, with, little, to, no, money, left, over, for, luxuries, spaun, was, well, aware, that, schubert, was, discontented, with, his, life, at, the, schoolhouse, and, was, concerned, for, schubert, s, development, intellectually, and, musically, in, may, 1816, spaun, moved, from, his, apartment, in, landskrongasse, in, the, inner, city, to, a, new, home, in, the, landstra, e, suburb, one, of, the, first, things, he, did, after, he, settled, into, the, new, home, was, to, invite, schubert, to, spend, a, few, days, with, him, this, was, probably, schubert, s, first, visit, away, from, home, or, school, schubert, s, unhappiness, during, his, years, as, a, schoolteacher, possibly, showed, early, signs, of, depression, and, it, is, virtually, certain, that, schubert, suffered, from, cyclothymia, throughout, his, life, in, 1989, the, musicologist, maynard, solomon, suggested, that, schubert, was, erotically, attracted, to, men, a, thesis, that, has, been, heatedly, debated, the, musicologist, and, schubert, expert, rita, steblin, has, said, that, he, was, chasing, women, the, theory, of, schubert, s, sexuality, or, schubert, as, other, has, continued, to, influence, current, scholarship, biographer, lorraine, byrne, bodley, is, sceptical, of, solomon, s, outing, of, schubert, saying, this, misunderstands, the, passionate, homosocial, friendships, of, 19th, century, europe, significant, changes, occurred, in, schubert, s, life, in, 1816, when, schober, a, student, from, an, affluent, family, invited, him, to, lodge, at, his, mother, s, house, the, proposal, was, particularly, opportune, for, schubert, had, just, made, the, unsuccessful, application, for, the, post, of, kapellmeister, at, laibach, and, he, had, also, decided, not, to, resume, teaching, duties, at, his, father, s, school, by, the, end, of, the, year, he, became, a, guest, in, schober, s, lodgings, for, a, time, he, attempted, to, increase, the, household, resources, by, giving, music, lessons, but, they, were, soon, abandoned, and, he, devoted, himself, to, composition, i, compose, every, morning, and, when, one, piece, is, done, i, begin, another, during, this, year, he, focused, on, orchestral, and, choral, works, although, he, also, continued, to, write, lieder, much, of, this, work, was, unpublished, but, manuscripts, and, copies, circulated, among, friends, and, admirers, in, early, 1817, schober, introduced, schubert, to, johann, michael, vogl, a, prominent, baritone, twenty, years, schubert, s, senior, vogl, for, whom, schubert, went, on, to, write, a, great, many, songs, became, one, of, schubert, s, main, proponents, in, viennese, musical, circles, schubert, also, met, joseph, h, ttenbrenner, brother, of, anselm, who, also, played, a, role, in, promoting, his, music, these, and, an, increasing, circle, of, friends, and, musicians, became, responsible, for, promoting, collecting, and, after, his, death, preserving, his, work, heinrich, ansch, tz, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, schubert, was, an, active, member, of, the, 1817, 1818, unsinnsgesellschaft, nonsenses, society, and, various, scholars, agree, with, this, in, late, 1817, schubert, s, father, gained, a, new, position, at, a, school, in, rossau, not, far, from, lichtental, schubert, rejoined, his, father, and, reluctantly, took, up, teaching, duties, there, in, early, 1818, he, applied, for, membership, in, the, prestigious, gesellschaft, der, musikfreunde, intending, to, gain, admission, as, an, accompanist, but, also, so, that, his, music, especially, the, songs, could, be, performed, in, the, evening, concerts, he, was, rejected, on, the, basis, that, he, was, no, amateur, although, he, had, been, employed, as, a, schoolteacher, at, the, time, and, there, were, professional, musicians, already, among, the, society, s, membership, however, he, began, to, gain, more, notice, in, the, press, and, the, first, public, performance, of, a, secular, work, an, overture, performed, in, february, 1818, received, praise, from, the, press, in, vienna, and, abroad, schubert, spent, the, summer, of, 1818, as, a, music, teacher, to, the, family, of, count, johann, karl, esterh, zy, at, their, ch, teau, in, zsel, z, now, eliezovce, slovakia, the, pay, was, relatively, good, and, his, duties, teaching, piano, and, singing, to, the, two, daughters, marie, and, caroline, were, relatively, light, allowing, him, to, compose, happily, schubert, may, have, written, his, marches, militaire, in, d, major, d, 733, no, 1, for, marie, and, caroline, in, addition, to, other, piano, duets, on, his, return, from, zsel, z, he, took, up, residence, with, his, friend, mayrhofer, during, the, early, 1820s, schubert, was, part, of, a, close, knit, circle, of, artists, and, students, who, had, social, gatherings, together, that, became, known, as, schubertiads, many, of, them, took, place, in, ignaz, von, sonnleithner, s, large, apartment, in, the, gundelhof, brandst, tte, 5, vienna, the, tight, circle, of, friends, with, which, schubert, surrounded, himself, was, dealt, a, blow, in, early, 1820, schubert, and, four, of, his, friends, were, arrested, by, the, austrian, police, who, in, the, aftermath, of, the, french, revolution, and, napoleonic, wars, were, on, their, guard, against, revolutionary, activities, and, suspicious, of, any, gathering, of, youth, or, students, one, of, schubert, s, friends, johann, senn, was, put, on, trial, imprisoned, for, over, a, year, and, then, permanently, forbidden, to, enter, vienna, the, other, four, including, schubert, were, severely, reprimanded, in, part, for, inveighing, against, with, insulting, and, opprobrious, language, while, schubert, never, saw, senn, again, he, did, set, some, of, his, poems, selige, welt, d, 743, and, schwanengesang, d, 744, to, music, the, incident, may, have, played, a, role, in, a, falling, out, with, mayrhofer, with, whom, he, was, living, at, the, time, schubert, who, was, only, a, little, more, than, five, feet, tall, was, nicknamed, schwammerl, by, his, friends, which, gibbs, describes, as, translating, to, tubby, or, little, mushroom, schwamm, is, mushroom, in, the, austrian, and, bavarian, dialects, of, german, the, ending, erl, makes, it, a, diminutive, gibbs, also, claims, he, may, have, occasionally, drunk, to, excess, noting, that, references, to, schubert, s, heavy, drinking, come, not, only, in, later, accounts, but, also, in, documents, dating, from, his, lifetime, schubert, s, compositions, of, 1819, and, 1820, show, a, marked, advance, in, development, and, maturity, of, style, he, began, the, ultimately, unfinished, oratorio, lazarus, d, 689, in, february, 1820, this, was, later, followed, by, the, hymn, der, 23, psalm, d, 706, the, octet, gesang, der, geister, ber, den, wassern, d, 714, the, quartettsatz, in, c, minor, d, 703, the, wanderer, fantasy, in, c, major, for, piano, d, 760, and, additional, smaller, works, in, 1820, two, of, schubert, s, operas, were, staged, die, zwillingsbr, der, d, 647, appeared, at, the, theater, am, k, rntnertor, on, 14, june, and, die, zauberharfe, d, 644, appeared, at, the, theater, an, der, wien, on, 21, august, hitherto, his, larger, compositions, apart, from, his, masses, had, been, restricted, to, the, amateur, orchestra, at, the, gundelhof, brandst, tte, 5, vienna, a, society, which, grew, out, of, the, quartet, parties, at, his, home, now, he, began, to, assume, a, more, prominent, position, addressing, a, wider, public, publishers, however, remained, distant, with, anton, diabelli, hesitantly, agreeing, to, print, some, of, his, works, on, commission, the, first, seven, opus, numbers, all, songs, appeared, on, these, terms, then, the, commission, ceased, and, he, began, to, receive, parsimonious, royalties, the, situation, improved, somewhat, in, march, 1821, when, vogl, performed, the, song, erlk, nig, d, 328, at, a, concert, that, was, extremely, well, received, that, month, schubert, composed, a, variation, on, a, waltz, by, diabelli, d, 718, being, one, of, the, fifty, composers, who, contributed, to, the, vaterl, ndischer, k, nstlerverein, publication, the, production, of, the, two, operas, turned, schubert, s, attention, more, firmly, than, ever, in, the, direction, of, the, stage, where, for, a, variety, of, reasons, he, was, almost, completely, unsuccessful, all, in, all, he, embarked, on, twenty, stage, projects, each, of, them, failures, that, were, quickly, forgotten, in, 1822, alfonso, und, estrella, was, rejected, partly, owing, to, its, libretto, written, by, schubert, s, friend, franz, von, schober, in, 1823, fierrabras, d, 796, was, rejected, domenico, barbaia, impresario, for, the, court, theatres, largely, lost, interest, in, new, german, opera, due, to, the, popularity, of, rossini, and, the, italian, operatic, style, and, the, failure, of, carl, maria, von, weber, s, euryanthe, die, verschworenen, the, conspirators, d, 787, was, prohibited, by, the, censor, apparently, because, of, its, title, and, the, play, rosamunde, f, rstin, von, zypern, for, which, schubert, had, written, incidental, music, d, 797, was, withdrawn, after, two, nights, due, to, the, play, s, poor, quality, despite, his, operatic, failures, schubert, s, reputation, was, growing, steadily, on, other, fronts, in, 1821, the, gesellschaft, der, musikfreunde, finally, accepted, him, as, a, performing, member, and, the, number, of, performances, of, his, music, grew, remarkably, these, performances, helped, schubert, s, reputation, grow, rapidly, among, the, members, of, the, gesellschaft, and, established, his, name, some, of, the, members, of, the, gesellschaft, most, notably, ignaz, von, sonnleithner, and, his, son, leopold, von, sonnleithner, had, a, sizeable, influence, on, the, affairs, of, the, society, and, as, a, result, of, that, and, of, schubert, s, growing, reputation, his, works, were, included, in, three, major, concerts, of, the, gesellschaft, in, 1821, in, april, one, of, his, male, voice, quartets, was, performed, and, in, november, his, overture, in, e, minor, d, 648, received, its, first, public, performance, at, a, different, concert, on, the, same, day, as, the, premiere, of, the, overture, his, song, der, wanderer, d, 489, was, performed, in, 1822, schubert, made, the, acquaintance, of, both, weber, and, beethoven, but, little, came, of, it, in, either, case, however, beethoven, is, said, to, have, acknowledged, the, younger, man, s, gifts, on, a, few, occasions, on, his, deathbed, beethoven, is, said, to, have, looked, into, some, of, the, younger, man, s, works, and, exclaimed, truly, the, spark, of, divine, genius, resides, in, this, schubert, beethoven, also, reportedly, predicted, that, schubert, would, make, a, great, sensation, in, the, world, and, regretted, that, he, had, not, been, more, familiar, with, him, earlier, he, wished, to, see, his, operas, and, works, for, piano, but, his, severe, illness, prevented, him, from, doing, so, despite, his, preoccupation, with, the, stage, and, subsequent, official, duties, schubert, wrote, a, significant, amount, of, music, during, these, years, he, completed, the, mass, in, a, flat, major, d, 678, in, 1822, and, later, that, year, embarked, suddenly, on, a, work, which, more, decisively, than, almost, any, other, in, those, years, showed, his, maturing, personal, vision, the, symphony, in, b, minor, known, as, the, unfinished, symphony, d, 759, the, reason, he, left, it, unfinished, after, writing, two, movements, and, sketches, some, way, into, a, third, continues, to, be, discussed, and, written, about, and, it, is, also, remarkable, that, he, did, not, mention, it, to, any, of, his, friends, even, though, as, brian, newbould, notes, he, must, have, felt, thrilled, by, what, he, was, achieving, in, 1823, schubert, wrote, his, first, large, scale, song, cycle, die, sch, ne, m, llerin, d, 795, setting, poems, by, wilhelm, m, ller, this, series, together, with, the, later, cycle, winterreise, d, 911, also, setting, texts, of, m, ller, in, 1827, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, pinnacles, of, lieder, he, also, composed, the, song, du, bist, die, ruh, you, are, rest, and, peace, d, 776, during, this, year, also, in, that, year, symptoms, of, syphilis, first, appeared, in, 1824, he, wrote, the, variations, in, e, minor, for, flute, and, piano, trockne, blumen, a, song, from, the, cycle, die, sch, ne, m, llerin, and, several, string, quartets, he, also, wrote, the, sonata, in, a, minor, for, arpeggione, and, piano, d, 821, at, the, time, when, there, was, a, minor, craze, over, that, instrument, in, the, spring, of, that, year, he, wrote, the, octet, in, f, major, d, 803, a, sketch, for, a, grand, symphony, and, in, the, summer, went, back, to, zseliz, there, he, became, attracted, to, hungarian, musical, idiom, and, wrote, the, divertissement, la, hongroise, in, g, minor, for, piano, duet, d, 818, and, the, string, quartet, in, a, minor, rosamunde, d, 804, it, has, been, said, that, he, held, a, hopeless, passion, for, his, pupil, the, countess, caroline, esterh, zy, but, the, only, work, that, bears, a,

friend, eduard, von, bauernfeld, penned, the, following, verse, which, appears, to, reference, schubert, s, unrequited, sentiments, in, love, with, a, countess, of, youthful, grace, a, pupil, of, galt, s, in, desperate, case, young, schubert, surrenders, himself, to, another, and, fain, would, avoid, such, affectionate, pother, the, setbacks, of, previous, years, were, compensated, by, the, prosperity, and, happiness, of, 1825, publication, had, been, moving, more, rapidly, the, stress, of, poverty, was, for, a, time, lightened, and, in, the, summer, he, had, a, pleasant, holiday, in, upper, austria, where, he, was, welcomed, with, enthusiasm, it, was, during, this, tour, that, he, produced, the, seven, song, cycle, fr, ulein, am, see, based, on, walter, scott, s, the, lady, of, the, lake, and, including, ellens, gesang, iii, hymn, to, the, virgin, d, 839, op, 52, no, 6, the, lyrics, of, adam, storck, s, german, translation, of, the, scott, poem, are, now, frequently, replaced, by, the, full, text, of, the, traditional, roman, catholic, prayer, hail, mary, ave, maria, in, latin, but, for, which, the, schubert, melody, is, not, an, original, setting, the, original, only, opens, with, the, greeting, ave, maria, which, also, recurs, only, in, the, refrain, in, 1825, schubert, also, wrote, the, piano, sonata, in, a, minor, d, 845, first, published, as, op, 42, and, began, the, symphony, in, c, major, great, c, major, d, 944, which, was, completed, the, following, year, from, 1826, to, 1828, schubert, resided, continuously, in, vienna, except, for, a, brief, visit, to, graz, austria, in, 1827, in, 1826, he, dedicated, a, symphony, d, 944, that, later, came, to, be, known, as, the, great, c, major, to, the, gesellschaft, der, musikfreunde, and, received, an, honorarium, in, return, the, string, quartet, no, 14, in, d, minor, d, 810, with, the, variations, on, death, and, the, maiden, was, written, during, the, winter, of, 1825, 1826, and, first, played, on, 25, january, 1826, later, in, the, year, came, the, string, quartet, no, 15, in, g, major, d, 887, first, published, as, op, 161, the, rondo, in, b, minor, for, violin, and, piano, d, 895, rondeau, brillant, and, the, piano, sonata, in, g, major, d, 894, first, published, as, fantasie, in, g, op, 78, he, also, produced, in, 1826, three, shakespearian, songs, of, which, st, ndchen, d, 889, and, an, sylvia, d, 891, were, allegedly, written, on, the, same, day, the, former, at, a, tavern, where, he, broke, his, afternoon, s, walk, the, latter, on, his, return, to, his, lodging, in, the, evening, the, works, of, his, last, two, years, reveal, a, composer, entering, a, new, professional, and, compositional, stage, although, parts, of, schubert, s, personality, were, influenced, by, his, friends, he, nurtured, an, intensely, personal, dimension, in, solitude, it, was, out, of, this, dimension, that, he, wrote, his, greatest, music, the, death, of, beethoven, affected, schubert, deeply, and, may, have, motivated, schubert, to, reach, new, artistic, peaks, in, 1827, schubert, wrote, the, song, cycle, winterreise, d, 911, the, fantasy, in, c, major, for, violin, and, piano, d, 934, first, published, as, op, post, 159, the, impromptus, for, piano, and, the, two, piano, trios, the, first, in, b, flat, major, d, 898, and, the, second, in, e, flat, major, d, 929, in,

the, string, quintet, in, c, major, d, 956, the, second, benedictus, to, the, mass, in, c, major, d, 961, the, three, final, piano, sonatas, d, 958, d, 959, and, d, 960, and, the, collection, 13, lieder, nach, gedichten, von, rellstab, und, heine, for, voice, and, piano, also, known, as, schwanengesang, swan, song, d, 957, this, collection, which, includes, settings, of, words, by, heinrich, heine, ludwig, rellstab, and, johann, gabriel, seidl, is, not, a, true, song, cycle, like, die, sch, ne, m, llerin, or, winterreise, the, great, c, major, symphony, is, dated, 1828, but, schubert, scholars, believe, that, this, symphony, was, largely, written, in, 1825, 1826, being, referred, to, while, he, was, on, holiday, at, gastein, in, 1825, that, work, once, considered, lost, is, now, generally, seen, as, an, early, stage, of, his, c, major, symphony, and, was, revised, for, prospective, performance, in, 1828, the, orchestra, of, the, gesellschaft, reportedly, read, through, the, symphony, at, a, rehearsal, but, never, scheduled, a, public, performance, of, it, the, reasons, continue, to, be, unknown, although, the, difficulty, of, the, symphony, is, a, possible, explanation, in, the, last, weeks, of, his, life, he, began, to, sketch, three, movements, for, a, new, symphony, in, d, major, d, 936a, in, this, work, he, anticipates, mahler, s, use, of, folksong, like, harmonics, and, bare, soundscapes, schubert, expressed, the, wish, were, he, to, survive, his, final, illness, to, further, develop, his, knowledge, of, harmony, and, counterpoint, and, had, actually, made, appointments, for, lessons, with, the, counterpoint, master, simon, sechter, on, 26, march, 1828, the, anniversary, of, beethoven, s, death, schubert, gave, for, the, only, time, in, his, career, a, public, concert, of, his, own, works, the, concert, was, a, success, popularly, and, financially, although, it, was, overshadowed, by, niccol, paganini, s, first, appearances, in, vienna, shortly, after, in, the, midst, of, this, creative, activity, his, health, deteriorated, by, the, late, 1820s, schubert, s, health, was, failing, and, he, confided, to, some, friends, that, he, feared, that, he, was, near, death, in, the, late, summer, of, 1828, he, saw, the, physician, ernst, rinna, who, may, have, confirmed, schubert, s, suspicions, that, he, was, ill, beyond, cure, and, likely, to, die, soon, some, of, his, symptoms, matched, those, of, mercury, poisoning, mercury, was, then, a, common, treatment, for, syphilis, again, suggesting, that, schubert, suffered, from, it, at, the, beginning, of, november, he, again, fell, ill, experiencing, headaches, fever, swollen, joints, and, vomiting, he, was, generally, unable, to, retain, solid, food, and, his, condition, worsened, five, days, before, schubert, s, death, his, friend, the, violinist, karl, holz, and, his, string, quartet, visited, to, play, for, him, the, last, musical, work, he, had, wished, to, hear, was, beethoven, s, string, quartet, no, 14, in, c, sharp, minor, op, 131, holz, commented, the, king, of, harmony, has, sent, the, king, of, song, a, friendly, bidding, to, the, crossing, schubert, died, in, vienna, aged, 31, on, 19, november, 1828, at, the, apartment, of, his, brother, ferdinand, the, cause, of, his, death, was, officially, diagnosed, as, typhoid, fever, though, other, theories, have, been, proposed, including, the, tertiary, stage, of, syphilis, although, there, are, accounts, by, his, friends, that, indirectly, imply, that, he, had, contracted, syphilis, earlier, the, symptoms, of, his, final, illness, do, not, correspond, with, tertiary, syphilis, six, weeks, before, his, death, he, walked, 42, miles, in, three, days, ruling, out, musculoskeletal, syphilis, in, the, month, of, his, death, he, composed, his, last, work, der, hirt, auf, dem, felsen, making, neurosyphilis, unlikely, and, meningovascular, syphilis, is, unlikely, because, it, presents, a, progressive, stroke, like, picture, and, schubert, had, no, neurological, manifestation, until, his, final, delirium, which, started, only, two, days, before, his, death, lastly, his, final, illness, was, characterized, by, gastrointestinal, symptoms, namely, vomiting, these, issues, all, led, robert, l, rold, to, argue, that, although, he, believed, schubert, had, syphilis, the, fatal, final, illness, was, a, gastrointestinal, one, such, as, salmonella, or, indeed, typhoid, fever, rold, also, pointed, out, that, when, schubert, was, in, his, final, illness, his, close, friend, schober, avoided, visiting, him, out, of, fear, of, contagion, yet, schober, had, known, of, his, earlier, possible, syphilis, and, had, never, avoided, schubert, in, the, past, eva, m, cybulska, goes, further, and, says, that, schubert, s, syphilis, is, a, conjecture, his, multi, system, signs, and, symptoms, she, says, could, point, at, a, number, of, different, illness, such, as, leukaemia, anaemia, or, hashimoto, s, thyroiditis, and, that, many, tell, tale, signs, of, syphilis, chancre, mucous, plaques, rash, on, the, thorax, pupil, abnormality, dysgraphia, were, absent, she, argues, that, the, syphilis, diagnosis, originated, with, schubert, s, biographer, otto, deutsch, in, 1907, based, on, the, aforementioned, indirect, references, by, his, friends, and, uncritically, repeated, ever, since, schubert, was, buried, at, his, own, request, near, the, grave, of, beethoven, whom, he, had, admired, all, his, life, in, the, village, cemetery, of, w, hring, on, the, edge, of, the, vienna, woods, a, year, earlier, he, had, served, as, a, torchbearer, at, beethoven, s, funeral, in, 1872, a, memorial, to, franz, schubert, was, erected, in, vienna, s, stadtpark, in, 1888, both, schubert, s, and, beethoven, s, graves, were, moved, to, the, zentralfriedhof, where, they, are, next, to, the, later, graves, of, johann, strauss, ii, and, johannes, brahms, anton, bruckner, was, present, at, both, exhumations, and, he, reached, into, both, coffins, and, held, the, revered, skulls, in, his, hands, the, cemetery, in, w, hring, was, converted, into, a, park, in, 1925, called, the, schubert, park, and, his, former, grave, site, was, marked, by, a, bust, his, epitaph, written, by, his, friend, the, poet, franz, grillparzer, reads, die, tonkunst, begrub, hier, einen, reichen, besitz, aber, noch, viel, sch, nere, hoffnungen, the, art, of, music, has, here, interred, a, precious, treasure, but, yet, far, fairer, hopes, schubert, was, remarkably, prolific, writing, over, 1, 500, works, in, his, short, career, his, compositional, style, progressed, rapidly, throughout, his, life, the, largest, number, of, his, compositions, are, songs, for, solo, voice, and, piano, roughly, 630, schubert, also, composed, a, considerable, number, of, secular, works, for, two, or, more, voices, namely, part, songs, choruses, and, cantatas, he, completed, eight, orchestral, overtures, and, seven, complete, symphonies, in, addition, to, fragments, of, six, others, while, he, composed, no, concertos, he, did, write, three, concertante, works, for, violin, and, orchestra, schubert, wrote, a, large, body, of, music, for, solo, piano, including, eleven, incontrovertibly, completed, sonatas, and, at, least, eleven, more, in, varying, states, of, completion, numerous, miscellaneous, works, and, many, short, dances, in, addition, to, producing, a, large, set, of, works, for, piano, four, hands, he, also, wrote, over, fifty, chamber, works, including, some, fragmentary, works, schubert, s, sacred, output, includes, seven, masses, one, oratorio, and, one, requiem, among, other, mass, movements, and, numerous, smaller, compositions, he, completed, only, eleven, of, his, twenty, stage, works, in, july, 1947, the, austrian, composer, ernst, krenek, discussed, schubert, s, style, abashedly, admitting, that, he, had, at, first, shared, the, wide, spread, opinion, that, schubert, was, a, lucky, inventor, of, pleasing, tunes, lacking, the, dramatic, power, and, searching, intelligence, which, distinguished, such, real, masters, as, j, s, bach, or, beethoven, krenek, wrote, that, he, reached, a, completely, different, assessment, after, a, close, study, of, schubert, s, pieces, at, the, urging, of, his, friend, and, fellow, composer, eduard, erdmann, krenek, pointed, to, the, piano, sonatas, as, giving, ample, evidence, that, was, much, more, than, an, easy, going, tune, smith, who, did, not, know, and, did, not, care, about, the, craft, of, composition, each, sonata, then, in, print, according, to, krenek, exhibited, a, great, wealth, of, technical, finesse, and, revealed, schubert, as, far, from, satisfied, with, pouring, his, charming, ideas, into, conventional, moulds, on, the, contrary, he, was, a, thinking, artist, with, a, keen, appetite, for, experimentation, that, appetite, for, experimentation, manifests, itself, repeatedly, in, schubert, s, output, in, a, wide, variety, of, forms, and, genres, including, opera, liturgical, music, chamber, and, solo, piano, music, and, symphonic, works, perhaps, most, familiarly, his, adventurousness, is, reflected, in, his, notably, original, sense, of, modulation, for, example, the, second, movement, of, the, string, quintet, d, 956, which, is, in, e, major, features, a, central, section, in, the, distant, key, of, f, minor, it, also, appears, in, unusual, choices, of, instrumentation, as, in, the, sonata, in, a, minor, for, arpeggione, and, piano, d, 821, or, the, unconventional, scoring, of, the, trout, quintet, d, 667, for, piano, violin, viola, cello, and, double, bass, whereas, conventional, piano, quintets, are, scored, for, piano, and, string, quartet, although, schubert, was, clearly, influenced, by, the, classical, sonata, forms, of, beethoven, haydn, and, mozart, his, formal, structures, and, his, developments, tend, to, give, the, impression, more, of, melodic, development, than, of, harmonic, drama, this, combination, of, classical, form, and, long, breathed, romantic, melody, sometimes, lends, them, a, discursive, style, his, great, c, major, symphony, was, described, by, robert, schumann, as, running, to, heavenly, lengths, it, was, in, the, genre, of, the, lied, that, schubert, made, his, most, indelible, mark, leon, plantinga, remarks, that, in, his, more, than, six, hundred, lieder, he, explored, and, expanded, the, potentialities, of, the, genre, as, no, composer, before, him, prior, to, schubert, s, influence, lieder, tended, toward, a, strophic, syllabic, treatment, of, text, evoking, the, folksong, qualities, engendered, by, the, stirrings, of, romantic, nationalism, among, schubert, s, treatments, of, the, poetry, of, goethe, his, settings, of, gretchen, am, spinnrade, d, 118, and, der, erlk, nig, d, 328, are, particularly, striking, for, their, dramatic, content, forward, looking, uses, of, harmony, and, use, of, eloquent, pictorial, keyboard, figurations, such, as, the, depiction, of, the, spinning, wheel, and, treadle, in, the, piano, in, gretchen, and, the, furious, and, ceaseless, gallop, in, erlk, nig, he, composed, music, using, the, poems, of, myriad, poets, with, goethe, mayrhofer, and, schiller, the, most, frequent, and, others, including, heinrich, heine, friedrich, r, ckert, and, joseph, freiherr, von, eichendorff, of, particular, note, are, his, two, song, cycles, on, the, poems, of, wilhelm, m, ller, die, sch, ne, m, llerin, and, winterreise, which, helped, to, establish, the, genre, and, its, potential, for, musical, poetic, and, almost, operatic, dramatic, narrative, his, last, collection, of, songs, published, in, 1828, after, his, death, schwanengesang, is, also, an, innovative, contribution, to, german, lieder, literature, as, it, features, poems, by, different, poets, namely, ludwig, rellstab, heine, and, johann, gabriel, seidl, the, wiener, theaterzeitung, writing, about, winterreise, at, the, time, commented, that, it, was, a, work, that, none, can, sing, or, hear, without, being, deeply, moved, anton, n, dvo, k, wrote, in, 1894, that, schubert, whom, he, considered, one, of, the, truly, great, composers, was, clearly, influential, on, shorter, works, especially, lieder, and, shorter, piano, works, the, tendency, of, the, romantic, school, has, been, toward, short, forms, and, although, weber, helped, to, show, the, way, to, schubert, belongs, the, chief, credit, of, originating, the, short, models, of, piano, forte, pieces, which, the, romantic, school, has, preferably, cultivated, schubert, created, a, new, epoch, with, the, lied, all, other, songwriters, have, followed, in, his, footsteps, when, schubert, died, he, had, around, 100, opus, numbers, published, mainly, songs, chamber, music, and, smaller, piano, compositions, publication, of, smaller, pieces, continued, including, opus, numbers, up, to, 173, in, the, 1860s, 50, instalments, with, songs, published, by, diabelli, and, dozens, of, first, publications, peters, but, the, manuscripts, of, many, of, the, longer, works, whose, existence, was, not, widely, known, remained, hidden, in, cabinets, and, file, boxes, of, schubert, s, family, friends, and, publishers, even, some, of, schubert, s, friends, were, unaware, of, the, full, scope, of, what, he, wrote, and, for, many, years, he, was, primarily, recognized, as, the, prince, of, song, although, there, was, recognition, of, some, of, his, larger, scale, efforts, in, 1838, robert, schumann, on, a, visit, to, vienna, found, the, dusty, manuscript, of, the, c, major, symphony, d, 944, and, took, it, back, to, leipzig, where, it, was, performed, by, felix, mendelssohn, and, celebrated, in, the, neue, zeitschrift, an, important, step, towards, the, recovery, of, the, neglected, works, was, the, journey, to, vienna, which, the, music, historian, george, grove, and, the, composer, arthur, sullivan, made, in, october, 1867, the, travellers, unearthed, the, manuscripts, of, six, of, the, symphonies, parts, of, the, incidental, music, to, rosamunde, the, mass, no, 1, in, f, major, d, 105, and, the, operas, des, teufels, lustschloss, d, 84, fernardo, d, 220, der, vierj, hrige, posten, d, 190, and, die, freunde, von, salamanka, d, 326, and, several, other, unnamed, works, with, these, discoveries, grove, and, sullivan, were, able, to, inform, the, public, of, the, existence, of, these, works, in, addition, they, were, able, to, copy, the, fourth, and, sixth, symphonies, the, rosamunde, incidental, music, and, the, overture, to, die, freunde, von, salamanka, this, led, to, more, widespread, public, interest, in, schubert, s, work, from, 1884, to, 1897, breitkopf, h, rtel, published, franz, schubert, s, works, a, critical, edition, including, a, contribution, made, among, others, by, johannes, brahms, editor, of, the, first, series, containing, eight, symphonies, the, publication, of, the, neue, schubert, ausgabe, by, b, renreiter, started, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, since, relatively, few, of, schubert, s, works, were, published, in, his, lifetime, only, a, small, number, of, them, have, opus, numbers, assigned, and, even, in, those, cases, the, sequence, of, the, numbers, does, not, give, a, good, indication, of, the, order, of, composition, austrian, musicologist, otto, erich, deutsch, 1883, 1967, is, known, for, compiling, the, first, comprehensive, catalogue, of, schubert, s, works, this, was, first, published, in, english, in, 1951, schubert, thematic, catalogue, and, subsequently, revised, for, a, new, edition, in, german, in, 1978, franz, schubert, thematisches, verzeichnis, seiner, werke, in, chronologischer, folge, franz, schubert, thematic, catalogue, of, his, works, in, chronological, order, confusion, arose, quite, early, over, the, numbering, of, schubert, s, late, symphonies, schubert, s, last, completed, symphony, the, great, c, major, d, 944, was, assigned, the, numbers, 7, 8, 9, and, 10, depending, on, publication, similarly, the, unfinished, d, 759, has, been, indicated, with, the, numbers, 7, 8, and, 9, the, order, usually, followed, for, these, late, symphonies, by, english, language, sources, is, an, even, broader, confusion, arose, over, the, numbering, of, the, piano, sonatas, with, numbering, systems, ranging, from, 15, to, 23, sonatas, among, pianos, schubert, had, access, to, were, a, benignus, seidner, piano, now, displayed, at, the, schubert, geburtshaus, in, vienna, and, an, anton, walter, sohn, piano, today, in, the, collection, of, the, vienna, kunsthistorisches, museum, schubert, was, also, familiar, with, instruments, by, viennese, piano, builder, conrad, graf, a, feeling, of, regret, for, the, loss, of, potential, masterpieces, caused, by, schubert, s, early, death, at, age, 31, was, expressed, in, the, epitaph, on, his, large, tombstone, written, by, grillparzer, here, music, has, buried, a, treasure, but, even, fairer, hopes, some, prominent, musicians, share, a, similar, view, including, the, pianist, radu, lupu, who, said, is, the, composer, for, whom, i, am, really, most, sorry, that, he, died, so, young, just, before, he, died, when, he, wrote, his, beautiful, two, cello, string, quintet, in, c, he, said, very, modestly, that, he, was, trying, to, learn, a, little, more, about, counterpoint, and, he, was, perfectly, right, we, ll, never, know, in, what, direction, he, was, going, or, would, have, gone, however, others, have, expressed, disagreement, with, this, early, view, for, instance, robert, schumann, said, it, is, pointless, to, guess, at, what, more, might, have, achieved, he, did, enough, and, let, them, be, honoured, who, have, striven, and, accomplished, as, he, did, and, the, pianist, andr, s, schiff, said, that, schubert, lived, a, very, short, life, but, it, was, a, very, concentrated, life, in, 31, years, he, lived, more, than, other, people, would, live, in, 100, years, and, it, is, needless, to, speculate, what, could, he, have, written, had, he, lived, another, 50, years, it, s, irrelevant, just, like, with, mozart, these, are, the, two, natural, geniuses, of, music, the, wiener, schubertbund, one, of, vienna, s, leading, choral, societies, was, founded, in, 1863, whilst, the, gr, nderzeit, was, taking, place, the, schubertbund, quickly, became, a, rallying, point, for, schoolteachers, and, other, members, of, the, viennese, middle, class, who, felt, increasingly, embattled, during, the, gr, nderzeit, and, the, aftermath, of, the, panic, of, 1873, in, 1872, the, dedication, of, the, schubert, denkmal, a, gift, to, the, city, from, vienna, s,
