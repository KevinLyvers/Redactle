to, harriet, poynton, 1780, 1809, in, early, 1820, the, family, moved, to, a, house, named, griff, house, between, nuneaton, and, bedworth, the, young, evans, was, a, voracious, reader, and, obviously, intelligent, because, she, was, not, considered, physically, beautiful, evans, was, not, thought, to, have, much, chance, of, marriage, and, this, coupled, with, her, intelligence, led, her, father, to, invest, in, an, education, not, often, afforded, to, women, from, ages, five, to, nine, she, boarded, with, her, sister, chrissey, at, miss, latham, s, school, in, attleborough, from,

taught, by, the, evangelical, maria, lewis, to, whom, her, earliest, surviving, letters, are, addressed, in, the, religious, atmosphere, of, the, misses, franklin, s, school, evans, was, exposed, to, a, quiet, disciplined, belief, opposed, to, evangelicalism, after, age, sixteen, evans, had, little, formal, education, thanks, to, her, father, s, important, role, on, the, estate, she, was, allowed, access, to, the, library, of, arbury, hall, which, greatly, aided, her, self, education, and, breadth, of, learning, her, classical, education, left, its, mark, christopher, stray, has, observed, that, george, eliot, s, novels, draw, heavily, on, greek, literature, only, one, of, her, books, can, be, printed, correctly, without, the, use, of, a, greek, typeface, and, her, themes, are, often, influenced, by, greek, tragedy, her, frequent, visits, to, the, estate, also, allowed, her, to, contrast, the, wealth, in, which, the, local, landowner, lived, with, the, lives, of, the, often, much, poorer, people, on, the, estate, and, different, lives, lived, in, parallel, would, reappear, in, many, of, her, works, the, other, important, early, influence, in, her, life, was, religion, she, was, brought, up, within, a, low, church, anglican, family, but, at, that, time, the, midlands, was, an, area, with, a, growing, number, of, religious, dissenters, in, 1836, her, mother, died, and, evans, then, 16, returned, home, to, act, as, housekeeper, though, she, continued, to, correspond, with, her, tutor, maria, lewis, when, she, was, 21, her, brother, isaac, married, and, took, over, the, family, home, so, evans, and, her, father, moved, to, foleshill, near, coventry, the, closeness, to, coventry, society, brought, new, influences, most, notably, those, of, charles, and, cara, bray, charles, bray, had, become, rich, as, a, ribbon, manufacturer, and, had, used, his, wealth, in, the, building, of, schools, and, in, other, philanthropic, causes, evans, who, had, been, struggling, with, religious, doubts, for, some, time, became, intimate, friends, with, the, radical, free, thinking, brays, who, had, a, casual, view, of, marital, obligations, and, the, brays, rosehill, home, was, a, haven, for, people, who, held, and, debated, radical, views, the, people, whom, the, young, woman, met, at, the, brays, house, included, robert, owen, herbert, spencer, harriet, martineau, and, ralph, waldo, emerson, through, this, society, evans, was, introduced, to, more, liberal, and, agnostic, theologies, and, to, writers, such, as, david, strauss, and, ludwig, feuerbach, who, cast, doubt, on, the, literal, truth, of, biblical, texts, in, fact, her, first, major, literary, work, was, an, english, translation, of, strauss, s, das, leben, jesu, kritisch, bearbeitet, as, the, life, of, jesus, critically, examined, 1846, which, she, completed, after, it, had, been, left, incomplete, by, elizabeth, rufa, brabant, another, member, of, the, rosehill, circle, the, strauss, book, had, caused, a, sensation, in, germany, by, arguing, that, the, miracles, in, the, new, testament, were, mythical, additions, with, little, basis, in, fact, evans, s, translation, had, a, similar, effect, in, england, with, the, earl, of, shaftesbury, calling, her, translation, the, most, pestilential, book, ever, vomited, out, of, the, jaws, of, hell, later, she, translated, feuerbach, s, the, essence, of, christianity, 1854, the, ideas, in, these, books, would, have, an, effect, on, her, own, fiction, as, a, product, of, their, friendship, bray, published, some, of, evans, s, own, earliest, writing, such, as, reviews, in, his, newspaper, the, coventry, herald, and, observer, as, evans, began, to, question, her, own, religious, faith, her, father, threatened, to, throw, her, out, of, the, house, but, his, threat, was, not, carried, out, instead, she, respectfully, attended, church, and, continued, to, keep, house, for, him, until, his, death, in, 1849, when, she, was, 30, five, days, after, her, father, s, funeral, she, travelled, to, switzerland, with, the, brays, she, decided, to, stay, on, in, geneva, alone, living, first, on, the, lake, at, plongeon, near, the, present, day, united, nations, buildings, and, then, on, the, second, floor, of, a, house, owned, by, her, friends, fran, ois, and, juliet, d, albert, durade, on, the, rue, de, chanoines, now, the, rue, de, la, pelisserie, she, commented, happily, that, one, feels, in, a, downy, nest, high, up, in, a, good, old, tree, her, stay, is, commemorated, by, a, plaque, on, the, building, while, residing, there, she, read, avidly, and, took, long, walks, in, the, beautiful, swiss, countryside, which, was, a, great, inspiration, to, her, fran, ois, durade, painted, her, portrait, there, as, well, on, her, return, to, england, the, following, year, 1850, she, moved, to, london, with, the, intent, of, becoming, a, writer, and, she, began, referring, to, herself, as, marian, evans, she, stayed, at, the, house, of, john, chapman, the, radical, publisher, whom, she, had, met, earlier, at, rosehill, and, who, had, published, her, strauss, translation, she, then, joined, chapman, s, m, nage, trois, along, with, his, wife, and, mistress, chapman, had, recently, purchased, the, campaigning, left, wing, journal, the, westminster, review, evans, became, its, assistant, editor, in, 1851, after, joining, just, a, year, earlier, evans, s, writings, for, the, paper, were, comments, on, her, views, of, society, and, the, victorian, way, of, thinking, she, was, sympathetic, to, the, lower, classes, and, criticised, organised, religion, throughout, her, articles, and, reviews, and, commented, on, contemporary, ideas, of, the, time, much, of, this, was, drawn, from, her, own, experiences, and, knowledge, and, she, used, this, to, critique, other, ideas, and, organisations, this, led, to, her, writing, being, viewed, as, authentic, and, wise, but, not, too, obviously, opinionated, evans, also, focused, on, the, business, side, of, the, review, with, attempts, to, change, its, layout, and, design, although, chapman, was, officially, the, editor, it, was, evans, who, did, most, of, the, work, of, producing, the, journal, contributing, many, essays, and, reviews, beginning, with, the, january, 1852, issue, and, continuing, until, the, end, of, her, employment, at, the, review, in, the, first, half, of, 1854, eliot, sympathized, with, the, 1848, revolutions, throughout, continental, europe, and, even, hoped, that, the, italians, would, chase, the, odious, austrians, out, of, lombardy, and, that, decayed, monarchs, would, be, pensioned, off, although, she, believed, a, gradual, reformist, approach, to, social, problems, was, best, for, england, in, 1850, 51, evans, attended, classes, in, mathematics, at, the, ladies, college, in, bedford, square, later, known, as, bedford, college, london, the, philosopher, and, critic, george, henry, lewes, 1817, 1878, met, evans, in, 1851, and, by, 1854, they, had, decided, to, live, together, lewes, was, already, married, to, agnes, jervis, although, in, an, open, marriage, in, addition, to, the, three, children, they, had, together, agnes, also, had, four, children, by, thornton, leigh, hunt, in, july, 1854, lewes, and, evans, travelled, to, weimar, and, berlin, together, for, the, purpose, of, research, before, going, to, germany, evans, continued, her, theological, work, with, a, translation, of, feuerbach, s, the, essence, of, christianity, and, while, abroad, she, wrote, essays, and, worked, on, her, translation, of, baruch, spinoza, s, ethics, which, she, completed, in, 1856, but, which, was, not, published, in, her, lifetime, because, the, prospective, publisher, refused, to, pay, the, requested, 75, in, 1981, eliot, s, translation, of, spinoza, s, ethics, was, finally, published, by, thomas, deegan, and, was, determined, to, be, in, the, public, domain, in, 2018, and, published, by, the, george, eliot, archive, it, has, been, re, published, in, 2020, by, princeton, university, press, the, trip, to, germany, also, served, as, a, honeymoon, for, evans, and, lewes, who, subsequently, considered, themselves, married, evans, began, to, refer, to, lewes, as, her, husband, and, to, sign, her, name, as, mary, ann, evans, lewes, legally, changing, her, name, to, mary, ann, evans, lewes, after, his, death, the, refusal, to, conceal, the, relationship, was, contrary, to, the, social, conventions, of, the, time, and, attracted, considerable, disapproval, while, continuing, to, contribute, pieces, to, the, westminster, review, evans, resolved, to, become, a, novelist, and, set, out, a, pertinent, manifesto, in, one, of, her, last, essays, for, the, review, silly, novels, by, lady, novelists, 1856, the, essay, criticised, the, trivial, and, ridiculous, plots, of, contemporary, fiction, written, by, women, in, other, essays, she, praised, the, realism, of, novels, that, were, being, written, in, europe, at, the, time, an, emphasis, on, realistic, storytelling, confirmed, in, her, own, subsequent, fiction, she, also, adopted, a, nom, de, plume, george, eliot, as, she, explained, to, her, biographer, j, w, cross, george, was, lewes, s, forename, and, eliot, was, a, good, mouth, filling, easily, pronounced, word, although, female, authors, were, published, under, their, own, names, during, her, lifetime, she, wanted, to, escape, the, stereotype, of, women, s, writing, being, limited, to, lighthearted, romances, or, other, lighter, fare, not, to, be, taken, very, seriously, she, also, wanted, to, have, her, fiction, judged, separately, from, her, already, extensive, and, widely, known, work, as, a, translator, editor, and, critic, another, factor, in, her, use, of, a, pen, name, may, have, been, a, desire, to, shield, her, private, life, from, public, scrutiny, thus, avoiding, the, scandal, that, would, have, arisen, because, of, her, relationship, with, lewes, who, was, married, in, 1857, when, she, was, 37, years, of, age, the, sad, fortunes, of, the, reverend, amos, barton, the, first, of, the, three, stories, included, in, scenes, of, clerical, life, and, the, first, work, of, george, eliot, was, published, in, blackwood, s, magazine, the, scenes, published, as, a, 2, volume, book, in, 1858, was, well, received, and, was, widely, believed, to, have, been, written, by, a, country, parson, or, perhaps, the, wife, of, a, parson, eliot, was, profoundly, influenced, by, the, works, of, thomas, carlyle, as, early, as, 1841, she, referred, to, him, as, a, grand, favourite, of, mine, and, references, to, him, abound, in, her, letters, from, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, according, to, university, of, victoria, professor, lisa, surridge, carlyle, stimulated, eliot, s, interest, in, german, thought, encouraged, her, turn, from, christian, orthodoxy, and, shaped, her, ideas, on, work, duty, sympathy, and, the, evolution, of, the, self, these, themes, made, their, way, into, evans, s, first, complete, novel, adam, bede, 1859, it, was, an, instant, success, and, prompted, yet, more, intense, curiosity, as, to, the, author, s, identity, there, was, even, a, pretender, to, the, authorship, one, joseph, liggins, this, public, interest, subsequently, led, to, marian, evans, lewes, s, acknowledgment, that, it, was, she, who, stood, behind, the, pseudonym, george, eliot, adam, bede, is, known, for, embracing, a, realist, aesthetic, inspired, by, dutch, visual, art, the, revelations, about, eliot, s, private, life, surprised, and, shocked, many, of, her, admiring, readers, but, this, did, not, affect, her, popularity, as, a, novelist, her, relationship, with, lewes, afforded, her, the, encouragement, and, stability, she, needed, to, write, fiction, but, it, would, be, some, time, before, the, couple, were, accepted, into, polite, society, acceptance, was, finally, confirmed, in, 1877, when, they, were, introduced, to, princess, louise, the, daughter, of, queen, victoria, the, queen, herself, was, an, avid, reader, of, all, of, eliot, s, novels, and, was, so, impressed, with, adam, bede, that, she, commissioned, the, artist, edward, henry, corbould, to, paint, scenes, from, the, book, when, the, american, civil, war, broke, out, in, 1861, eliot, expressed, sympathy, for, the, union, cause, something, which, historians, have, attributed, to, her, abolitionist, sympathies, in, 1868, she, supported, philosopher, richard, congreve, s, protests, against, governmental, policies, in, ireland, and, had, a, positive, view, of, the, growing, movement, in, support, of, irish, home, rule, she, was, influenced, by, the, writings, of, john, stuart, mill, and, read, all, of, his, major, works, as, they, were, published, in, mill, s, the, subjection, of, women, 1869, she, judged, the, second, chapter, excoriating, the, laws, which, oppress, married, women, excellent, she, was, supportive, of, mill, s, parliamentary, run, but, believed, that, the, electorate, was, unlikely, to, vote, for, a, philosopher, and, was, surprised, when, he, won, while, mill, served, in, parliament, she, expressed, her, agreement, with, his, efforts, on, behalf, of, female, suffrage, being, inclined, to, hope, for, much, good, from, the, serious, presentation, of, women, s, claims, before, parliament, in, a, letter, to, john, morley, she, declared, her, support, for, plans, which, held, out, reasonable, promise, of, tending, to, establish, as, far, as, possible, an, equivalence, of, advantage, for, the, two, sexes, as, to, education, and, the, possibilities, of, free, development, and, dismissed, appeals, to, nature, in, explaining, women, s, lower, status, in, 1870, she, responded, enthusiastically, to, lady, amberley, s, feminist, lecture, on, the, claims, of, women, for, education, occupations, equality, in, marriage, and, child, custody, however, it, would, not, be, correct, to, assume, that, the, female, protagonists, of, her, works, can, be, considered, feminist, with, the, sole, exception, perhaps, of, romola, de, bardi, who, resolutely, rejects, the, state, and, church, obligations, of, her, time, after, the, success, of, adam, bede, eliot, continued, to, write, popular, novels, for, the, next, fifteen, years, within, a, year, of, completing, adam, bede, she, finished, the, mill, on, the, floss, dedicating, the, manuscript, to, my, beloved, husband, george, henry, lewes, i, give, this, ms, of, my, third, book, written, in, the, sixth, year, of, our, life, together, at, holly, lodge, south, field, wandsworth, and, finished, 21, march, 1860, silas, marner, 1861, and, romola, 1863, soon, followed, and, later, felix, holt, the, radical, 1866, and, her, most, acclaimed, novel, middlemarch, 1871, 1872, her, last, novel, was, daniel, deronda, published, in, 1876, after, which, she, and, lewes, moved, to, witley, surrey, by, this, time, lewes, s, health, was, failing, and, he, died, two, years, later, on, 30, november, 1878, eliot, spent, the, next, six, months, editing, lewes, s, final, work, life, and, mind, for, publication, and, found, solace, and, companionship, with, longtime, friend, and, financial, adviser, john, walter, cross, a, scottish, commission, agent, 20, years, her, junior, whose, mother, had, recently, died, on, 16, may, 1880, eighteen, months, after, lewes, death, eliot, married, john, walter, cross, 1840, 1924, and, again, changed, her, name, this, time, to, mary, ann, cross, while, the, marriage, courted, some, controversy, due, to, the, 21, year, age, differences, it, pleased, her, brother, isaac, that, she, was, married, in, this, relationship, he, had, broken, off, relations, with, her, when, she, had, begun, to, live, with, lewes, and, now, sent, congratulations, while, the, couple, were, honeymooning, in, venice, cross, in, a, suicide, attempt, jumped, from, the, hotel, balcony, into, the, grand, canal, he, survived, and, the, newlyweds, returned, to, england, they, moved, to, a, new, house, in, chelsea, but, eliot, fell, ill, with, a, throat, infection, this, coupled, with, the, kidney, disease, with, which, she, had, been, afflicted, for, several, years, led, to, her, death, on, 22, december, 1880, at, the, age, of, 61, due, to, her, denial, of, the, christian, faith, and, her, relationship, with, lewes, eliot, was, not, buried, in, westminster, abbey, she, was, instead, interred, in, highgate, cemetery, east, highgate, london, in, the, area, reserved, for, political, and, religious, dissenters, and, agnostics, beside, the, love, of, her, life, george, henry, lewes, the, graves, of, karl, marx, and, her, friend, herbert, spencer, are, nearby, in, 1980, on, the, centenary, of, her, death, a, memorial, stone, was, established, for, her, in, the, poets, corner, between, w, h, auden, and, dylan, thomas, with, a, quote, from, scenes, of, clerical, life, the, first, condition, of, human, goodness, is, something, to, love, the, second, something, to, reverence, george, eliot, was, considered, by, contemporaries, to, be, a, physically, unattractive, woman, she, herself, knew, this, and, made, jokes, about, her, appearance, in, letters, to, friends, yet, somehow, the, force, of, her, personality, overcame, her, ugliness, this, was, noted, by, numerous, acquaintances, of, his, first, meeting, with, her, on, 9, may, 1869, henry, james, wrote, to, begin, with, she, is, magnificently, ugly, deliciously, hideous, she, has, a, low, forehead, a, dull, grey, eye, a, vast, pendulous, nose, a, huge, mouth, full, of, uneven, teeth, a, chin, jawbone, qui, n, en, finissent, pas, now, in, this, vast, ugliness, resides, a, most, powerful, beauty, which, in, a, very, few, minutes, steals, forth, charms, the, mind, so, that, you, end, as, i, ended, in, falling, in, love, with, her, she, spelled, her, name, differently, at, different, times, mary, anne, was, the, spelling, used, by, her, father, for, the, baptismal, record, and, she, uses, this, spelling, in, her, earliest, letters, within, her, family, however, it, was, spelled, mary, ann, by, 1852, she, had, changed, to, marian, but, she, reverted, to, mary, ann, in, 1880, after, she, married, john, cross, her, memorial, stone, reads, here, lies, the, body, of, george, eliot, mary, ann, cross, several, landmarks, in, her, birthplace, of, nuneaton, are, named, in, her, honour, these, include, the, george, eliot, academy, middlemarch, junior, school, george, eliot, hospital, formerly,

small, town, persecution, felix, holt, the, radical, and, the, legend, of, jubal, were, overtly, political, and, political, crisis, is, at, the, heart, of, middlemarch, in, which, she, presents, the, stories, of, a, number, of, inhabitants, of, a, small, english, town, on, the, eve, of, the, reform, bill, of, 1832, the, novel, is, notable, for, its, deep, psychological, insight, and, sophisticated, character, portraits, the, roots, of, her, realist, philosophy, can, be, found, in, her, review, of, john, ruskin, s, modern, painters, in, westminster, review, in, 1856, eliot, also, express, proto, zionist, ideas, in, daniel, deronda, readers, in, the, victorian, era, praised, her, novels, for, their, depictions, of, rural, society, much, of, the, material, for, her, prose, was, drawn, from, her, own, experience, she, shared, with, wordsworth, the, belief, that, there, was, much, value, and, beauty, to, be, found, in, the, mundane, details, of, ordinary, country, life, eliot, did, not, however, confine, herself, to, stories, of, the, english, countryside, romola, an, historical, novel, set, in, late, fifteenth, century, florence, was, based, on, the, life, of, the, italian, priest, girolamo, savonarola, in, the, spanish, gypsy, eliot, made, a, foray, into, verse, but, her, poetry, s, initial, popularity, has, not, endured, working, as, a, translator, eliot, was, exposed, to, german, texts, of, religious, social, and, moral, philosophy, such, as, david, friedrich, strauss, s, life, of, jesus, and, feuerbach, s, the, essence, of, christianity, also, important, was, her, translation, from, latin, of, jewish, dutch, philosopher, spinoza, s, ethics, elements, from, these, works, show, up, in, her, fiction, much, of, which, is, written, with, her, trademark, sense, of, agnostic, humanism, according, to, clare, carlisle, who, published, a, new, biography, on, george, eliot, in, 2023, the, overdue, publication, of, spinoza, s, ethics, was, a, real, shame, because, it, could, have, provided, some, illuminating, cues, for, understanding, the, more, mature, works, of, the, writer, she, had, taken, particular, notice, of, feuerbach, s, conception, of,
