was, one, of, the, principal, figures, of, the, period, known, as, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, born, in, kilkea, county, kildare, ireland, shackleton, and, his, anglo, irish, family, moved, to, sydenham, in, suburban, south, london, when, he, was, ten, shackleton, s, first, experience, of, the, polar, regions, was, as, third, officer, on, captain, robert, falcon, scott, s, discovery, expedition, of, 1901, 1904, from, which, he, was, sent, home, early, on, health, grounds, after, he, and, his, companions, scott, and, edward, adrian, wilson, set, a, new, southern, record, by, marching, to, latitude, 82, s, during, the, nimrod, expedition, of, 1907, 1909, he, and, three, companions, established, a, new, record, farthest, south, latitude, of, 88, 23, s, only, 97, geographical, miles, 112, statute, miles, or, 180, kilometres, from, the, south, pole, the, largest, advance, to, the, pole, in, exploration, history, also, members, of, his, team, climbed, mount, erebus, the, most, active, antarctic, volcano, on, returning, home, shackleton, was, knighted, for, his, achievements, by, king, edward, vii, after, the, race, to, the, south, pole, ended, in, december, 1911, with, roald, amundsen, s, conquest, shackleton, turned, his, attention, to, the, crossing, of, antarctica, from, sea, to, sea, via, the, pole, to, this, end, he, made, preparations, for, what, became, the, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, of, 1914, 1917, the, expedition, was, struck, by, disaster, when, its, ship, endurance, became, trapped, in, pack, ice, and, finally, sank, in, the, weddell, sea, off, antarctica, on, 21, november, 1915, the, crew, escaped, by, camping, on, the, sea, ice, until, it, disintegrated, then, by, launching, the, lifeboats, to, reach, elephant, island, and, ultimately, the, south, atlantic, island, of, south, georgia, enduring, a, stormy, ocean, voyage, of, 720, nautical, miles, 1, 330, km, 830, mi, in, shackleton, s, most, famous, exploit, he, returned, to, the, antarctic, with, the, shackleton, rowett, expedition, in, 1921, but, died, of, a, heart, attack, while, his, ship, was, moored, in, south, georgia, at, his, wife, s, request, he, remained, on, the, island, and, was, buried, in, grytviken, cemetery, the, wreck, of, endurance, was, discovered, just, over, a, century, after, shackleton, s, death, away, from, his, expeditions, shackleton, s, life, was, generally, restless, and, unfulfilled, in, his, search, for, rapid, pathways, to, wealth, and, security, he, launched, business, ventures, which, failed, to, prosper, and, he, died, heavily, in, debt, upon, his, death, he, was, lauded, in, the, press, but, was, thereafter, largely, forgotten, while, the, heroic, reputation, of, his, rival, scott, was, sustained, for, many, decades, later, in, the, 20th, century, shackleton, was, rediscovered, and, he, became, a, role, model, for, leadership, in, extreme, circumstances, in, his, 1956, address, to, the, british, science, association, one, of, shackleton, s, contemporaries, sir, raymond, priestley, said, scott, for, scientific, method, amundsen, for, speed, and, efficiency, but, when, disaster, strikes, and, all, hope, is, gone, get, down, on, your, knees, and, pray, for, shackleton, paraphrasing, what, apsley, cherry, garrard, had, written, in, a, preface, to, his, 1922, memoir, the, worst, journey, in, the, world, in, 2002, shackleton, was, voted, eleventh, in, a, bbc, poll, of, the, 100, greatest, britons, shackleton, was, born, on, 15, february, 1874, in, kilkea, county, kildare, ireland, his, father, henry, shackleton, tried, to, enter, the, british, army, but, his, poor, health, prevented, him, from, doing, so, instead, he, became, a, farmer, and, settled, in, kilkea, the, shackleton, family, are, of, english, origin, specifically, from, west, yorkshire, shackleton, s, father, was, descended, from, abraham, shackleton, an, english, quaker, who, moved, to, ireland, in, 1726, and, started, a, school, in, ballitore, county, kildare, shackleton, s, mother, henrietta, letitia, sophia, gavan, was, descended, from, the, fitzmaurice, family, ernest, was, the, second, of, ten, children, and, the, first, of, two, sons, the, second, frank, achieved, notoriety, as, a, suspect, later, exonerated, in, the, 1907, theft, of, the, so, called, irish, crown, jewels, which, have, never, been, recovered, in, 1880, when, ernest, was, six, his, father, gave, up, his, life, as, a, landowner, to, study, medicine, at, trinity, college, dublin, moving, his, family, to, the, city, four, years, later, they, left, ireland, and, moved, to, sydenham, in, suburban, london, this, was, partly, in, search, of, better, professional, prospects, for, the, newly, qualified, doctor, but, another, factor, may, have, been, unease, about, the, family, s, anglo, irish, ancestry, following, the, 1882, assassination, by, irish, nationalists, of, lord, frederick, cavendish, the, british, chief, secretary, for, ireland, however, shackleton, took, lifelong, pride, in, his, irish, roots, and, frequently, declared, that, he, was, an, irishman, from, early, childhood, shackleton, was, a, voracious, reader, a, pursuit, which, sparked, in, him, a, passion, for, adventure, he, was, schooled, by, a, governess, until, the, age, of, eleven, when, he, began, at, fir, lodge, preparatory, school, in, west, hill, dulwich, in, southeast, london, at, the, age, of, thirteen, he, entered, dulwich, college, as, a, youngster, shackleton, did, not, particularly, distinguish, himself, as, a, scholar, and, was, said, to, be, bored, by, his, studies, he, was, quoted, later, as, saying, i, never, learned, much, geography, at, school, literature, too, consisted, in, the, dissection, the, parsing, the, analysing, of, certain, passages, from, our, great, poets, and, prose, writers, teachers, should, be, very, careful, not, to, spoil, taste, for, poetry, for, all, time, by, making, it, a, task, and, an, imposition, in, his, final, term, at, the, school, he, was, still, able, to, achieve, fifth, place, in, his, class, of, thirty, one, shackleton, s, restlessness, at, school, was, such, that, he, was, allowed, to, leave, at, sixteen, and, go, to, sea, one, option, was, a, royal, navy, officer, cadetship, in, the, britannia, at, dartmouth, but, this, was, too, expensive, and, shackleton, passed, the, upper, age, limit, of, fourteen, and, a, half, in, 1888, alternatives, were, the, mercantile, marine, cadet, ships, worcester, and, conway, or, an, apprenticeship, before, the, mast, on, a, sailing, vessel, this, third, option, was, chosen, his, father, was, able, to, secure, him, a, berth, with, the, north, western, shipping, company, aboard, the, square, rigged, sailing, ship, hoghton, tower, over, the, next, four, years, at, sea, shackleton, learned, his, trade, and, visited, many, parts, of, the, world, forming, a, variety, of, acquaintances, and, learning, to, associate, with, people, from, many, different, walks, of, life, in, august, 1894, he, passed, his, examination, for, second, mate, and, accepted, a, post, as, third, officer, on, a, tramp, steamer, of, the, welsh, shire, line, two, years, later, he, had, obtained, his, first, mate, s, ticket, and, in, 1898, he, was, certified, as, a, master, mariner, qualifying, him, to, command, a, british, ship, anywhere, in, the, world, in, 1898, he, joined, union, castle, line, the, regular, mail, and, passenger, carrier, between, britain, and, south, africa, one, of, his, shipmates, recorded, that, shackleton, was, a, departure, from, our, usual, type, of, young, officer, content, with, his, own, company, though, not, aloof, spouting, lines, from, keats, or, browning, a, mixture, of, sensitivity, and, aggression, but, not, unsympathetic, following, the, outbreak, of, the, boer, war, in, 1899, shackleton, transferred, to, the, troopship, tintagel, castle, where, in, march, 1900, he, met, cedric, longstaff, an, army, lieutenant, whose, father, llewellyn, w, longstaff, was, the, main, financial, backer, of, the, british, national, antarctic, expedition, then, being, organised, in, london, shackleton, used, his, acquaintance, with, the, son, to, obtain, an, interview, with, longstaff, senior, with, a, view, to, obtaining, a, place, on, the, expedition, impressed, by, shackleton, s, keenness, longstaff, recommended, him, to, sir, clements, markham, the, expedition, s, overlord, making, it, clear, that, he, wanted, shackleton, accepted, on, 17, february, 1901, his, appointment, as, third, officer, to, the, expedition, s, ship, discovery, was, confirmed, on, 4, june, he, was, commissioned, into, the, royal, navy, with, the, rank, of, sub, lieutenant, in, the, royal, naval, reserve, although, officially, on, leave, from, union, castle, this, was, in, fact, the, end, of, shackleton, s, merchant, navy, service, the, british, national, antarctic, expedition, known, as, the, discovery, expedition, after, the, ship, discovery, was, the, brainchild, of, sir, clements, markham, president, of, the, royal, geographical, society, and, had, been, many, years, in, preparation, led, by, robert, falcon, scott, a, royal, navy, torpedo, lieutenant, lately, promoted, commander, the, expedition, had, objectives, that, included, scientific, and, geographical, discovery, although, discovery, was, not, a, royal, navy, unit, scott, required, the, crew, officers, and, scientific, staff, to, submit, to, the, conditions, of, the, naval, discipline, act, meaning, that, the, ship, and, expedition, were, run, on, royal, navy, lines, shackleton, accepted, this, approach, even, though, his, own, background, and, instincts, favoured, a, different, more, informal, style, of, leadership, his, particular, duties, were, listed, as, in, charge, of, sea, water, analysis, ward, room, caterer, in, charge, of, the, holds, stores, and, provisions, he, also, arranges, the, entertainments, discovery, departed, from, london, s, east, india, docks, on, 31, july, 1901, arriving, at, the, antarctic, coast, via, madeira, cape, town, and, new, zealand, on, 9, january, 1902, after, landing, shackleton, took, part, in, an, experimental, balloon, flight, on, 4, february, he, also, participated, with, the, scientists, edward, a, wilson, and, hartley, t, ferrar, in, the, first, sledging, trip, from, the, expedition, s, winter, quarters, in, mcmurdo, sound, a, journey, which, established, a, safe, route, on, to, the, great, ice, barrier, confined, to, the, iced, in, discovery, throughout, the, antarctic, winter, of, 1902, shackleton, edited, the, expedition, s, magazine, the, south, polar, times, a, regular, publication, that, kept, everyone, onboard, entertained, according, to, steward, clarence, hare, shackleton, was, the, most, popular, of, the, officers, among, the, crew, being, a, good, mixer, though, claims, that, this, represented, an, unofficial, rivalry, to, scott, s, leadership, are, unsupported, scott, chose, shackleton, to, accompany, wilson, and, himself, on, the, expedition, s, southern, journey, a, march, southwards, to, achieve, the, highest, possible, latitude, in, the, direction, of, the, south, pole, this, was, not, a, serious, attempt, on, the, pole, although, the, attainment, of, a, high, latitude, was, of, great, importance, to, scott, and, the, inclusion, of, shackleton, indicated, a, high, degree, of, personal, trust, the, party, set, out, on, 2, november, 1902, scott, later, wrote, that, the, march, was, a, combination, of, success, and, failure, they, reached, a, record, farthest, south, latitude, of, 82, 17, s, beating, the, previous, record, established, in, 1900, by, carsten, borchgrevink, the, journey, was, marred, by, the, poor, performance, of, the, dogs, who, rapidly, fell, sick, after, their, food, had, become, tainted, all, 22, dogs, died, during, the, march, the, three, men, all, suffered, at, times, from, snow, blindness, frostbite, and, ultimately, scurvy, on, the, return, journey, shackleton, had, by, his, own, admission, broken, down, and, could, no, longer, carry, out, his, share, of, the, work, he, later, denied, scott, s, claim, in, the, voyage, of, the, discovery, that, he, had, been, carried, on, the, sledge, he, was, in, a, severely, weakened, condition, wilson, s, diary, entry, for, 14, january, 1903, reads, shackleton, has, been, anything, but, up, to, the, mark, and, today, he, is, decidedly, worse, very, short, winded, and, coughing, constantly, with, more, serious, symptoms, which, need, not, be, detailed, here, but, which, are, of, no, small, consequence, a, hundred, and, sixty, miles, from, the, ship, and, full, loads, to, pull, all, the, way, the, party, finally, arrived, back, at, the, ship, on, 3, february, 1903, after, a, medical, examination, that, proved, inconclusive, scott, decided, to, send, shackleton, home, on, the, relief, ship, morning, which, had, arrived, in, mcmurdo, sound, in, january, scott, wrote, he, ought, not, to, risk, further, hardships, in, his, present, state, of, health, there, is, conjecture, that, scott, s, motive, for, removing, him, was, resentment, of, shackleton, s, popularity, and, that, ill, health, was, used, as, an, excuse, to, get, rid, of, him, years, after, the, deaths, of, scott, wilson, and, shackleton, the, expedition, s, second, in, command, albert, armitage, claimed, that, there, had, been, a, falling, out, on, the, southern, journey, and, that, scott, had, told, the, ship, s, doctor, that, he, does, not, go, back, sick, he, will, go, back, in, disgrace, there, is, no, corroboration, of, armitage, s, story, shackleton, and, scott, remained, on, friendly, terms, at, least, until, the, publication, of, scott, s, account, of, the, southern, journey, in, the, voyage, of, the, discovery, while, in, public, they, appeared, mutually, respectful, and, cordial, according, to, biographer, roland, huntford, shackleton, s, attitude, to, scott, turned, to, smouldering, scorn, and, dislike, salvage, of, wounded, pride, required, a, return, to, the, antarctic, and, an, attempt, to, outdo, scott, after, a, period, of, convalescence, in, new, zealand, shackleton, returned, to, england, via, san, francisco, and, new, york, as, the, first, significant, person, to, return, from, the, antarctic, he, found, that, he, was, in, demand, in, particular, the, admiralty, wished, to, consult, him, about, its, further, proposals, for, the, rescue, of, discovery, with, sir, clements, markham, s, blessing, he, accepted, a, temporary, post, assisting, the, outfitting, of, the, terra, nova, for, the, second, discovery, relief, operation, but, turned, down, the, offer, to, sail, with, her, as, chief, officer, he, also, assisted, in, the, equipping, of, the, argentine, uruguay, which, was, being, fitted, out, for, the, relief, of, the, stranded, swedish, antarctic, expedition, under, otto, nordenskj, ld, in, search, of, more, permanent, employment, in, 1903, shackleton, applied, for, a, regular, commission, in, the, royal, navy, via, the, back, door, route, of, the, supplementary, list, despite, the, sponsorship, of, markham, and, william, huggins, the, president, of, the, royal, society, his, application, was, unsuccessful, because, the, list, was, closed, the, admiralty, suggested, that, he, could, be, promoted, to, lieutenant, in, the, royal, naval, reserve, if, he, qualified, but, he, chose, to, resign, his, rnr, commission, the, following, year, instead, he, became, a, journalist, working, for, the, royal, magazine, but, he, found, this, unsatisfactory, he, was, then, offered, and, accepted, the, secretaryship, of, the, royal, scottish, geographical, society, rsgs, a, post, which, he, took, up, on, 11, january, 1904, three, months, later, on, 9, april, he, married, emily, dorman, with, whom, he, had, three, children, raymond, cecily, and, edward, himself, an, explorer, and, later, a, politician, in, 1905, shackleton, became, a, shareholder, in, a, speculative, company, that, aimed, to, make, a, fortune, transporting, russian, troops, home, from, the, far, east, despite, his, assurances, to, emily, that, we, are, practically, sure, of, the, contract, nothing, came, of, this, scheme, he, also, ventured, into, politics, unsuccessfully, standing, in, the, 1906, general, election, as, the, liberal, unionist, party, s, candidate, for, dundee, constituency, in, opposition, to, irish, home, rule, in, the, meantime, he, had, taken, a, job, with, wealthy, clydeside, industrialist, william, beardmore, later, lord, invernairn, with, a, roving, commission, which, involved, interviewing, prospective, clients, and, entertaining, beardmore, s, business, friends, he, was, by, this, time, making, no, secret, of, his, ambition, to, return, to, antarctica, at, the, head, of, his, own, expedition, beardmore, was, sufficiently, impressed, with, shackleton, to, offer, financial, support, but, other, donations, proved, hard, to, come, by, nevertheless, in, february, 1907, shackleton, presented, to, the, royal, geographical, society, his, plans, for, an, antarctic, expedition, the, details, of, which, under, the, name, british, antarctic, expedition, were, published, in, the, rgs, newsletter, geographical, journal, the, aim, was, the, conquest, of, both, the, geographical, south, pole, and, the, south, magnetic, pole, he, then, worked, hard, to, persuade, others, of, his, wealthy, friends, and, acquaintances, to, contribute, including, sir, philip, lee, brocklehurst, who, subscribed, 2, 000, equivalent, to, 267, 244, in, 2023, to, secure, a, place, on, the, expedition, author, campbell, mackellar, and, guinness, baron, lord, iveagh, whose, contribution, was, secured, less, than, two, weeks, before, the, departure, of, the, expedition, ship, nimrod, on, 4, august, 1907, shackleton, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, royal, victorian, order, 4th, class, mvo, the, present, day, grade, of, lieutenant, on, 7, august, 1907, the, nimrod, set, sail, from, england, for, the, start, of, the, british, antarctic, expedition, reaching, new, zealand, at, the, end, of, november, after, some, final, preparations, the, expedition, set, off, from, lyttelton, harbour, on, 1, january, 1908, heading, for, the, antarctic, shackleton, had, originally, planned, to, use, the, old, discovery, base, in, mcmurdo, sound, to, launch, his, attempts, on, the, south, pole, and, south, magnetic, pole, but, before, leaving, england, he, had, been, pressured, into, giving, scott, an, undertaking, not, to, base, himself, in, the, mcmurdo, area, which, scott, was, claiming, as, his, own, field, of, work, shackleton, reluctantly, agreed, to, seek, out, winter, quarters, at, either, the, barrier, inlet, which, he, had, briefly, visited, in, 1902, on, discovery, or, king, edward, vii, land, to, conserve, coal, the, ship, was, towed, 1, 650, miles, 2, 655, km, by, the, steamer, koonya, to, the, antarctic, ice, after, shackleton, had, persuaded, the, new, zealand, government, and, the, union, steamship, company, to, share, the, cost, in, accordance, with, shackleton, s, promise, to, scott, the, ship, headed, for, the, eastern, sector, of, the, great, ice, barrier, arriving, there, on, 21, january, 1908, they, discovered, that, the, barrier, inlet, had, expanded, to, form, a, large, bay, containing, hundreds, of, whales, and, they, immediately, christened, it, the, bay, of, whales, the, ice, conditions, were, found, to, be, unstable, making, it, impossible, to, establish, a, safe, base, at, the, barrier, inlet, and, an, extended, search, for, an, anchorage, at, king, edward, vii, land, proved, equally, futile, shackleton, was, forced, to, break, the, undertaking, he, had, made, to, scott, and, the, nimrod, set, sail, for, mcmurdo, sound, according, to, second, officer, arthur, harbord, this, decision, was, dictated, by, common, sense, in, view, of, the, difficulties, of, ice, pressure, coal, shortage, and, the, lack, of, any, alternative, base, known, to, be, close, at, hand, the, ship, arrived, at, mcmurdo, sound, on, 29, january, but, was, stopped, by, ice, 16, miles, 26, km, north, of, discovery, s, old, base, at, hut, point, after, considerable, weather, delays, a, base, was, eventually, established, at, cape, royds, about, 24, miles, 39, km, north, of, hut, point, the, party, was, in, high, spirits, despite, the, difficult, conditions, shackleton, s, ability, to, bond, with, his, crew, kept, the, party, happy, and, focused, on, 29, october, 1908, shackleton, and, three, companions, frank, wild, eric, marshall, and, jameson, adams, set, off, on, the, great, southern, journey, as, wild, called, it, on, 9, january, 1909, they, reached, a, new, farthest, south, latitude, of, 88, 23, s, a, point, 112, miles, 180, km, from, the, pole, en, route, the, south, pole, party, discovered, the, beardmore, glacier, named, after, shackleton, s, patron, and, the, four, men, became, the, first, persons, to, see, and, travel, on, the, south, polar, plateau, their, return, journey, to, mcmurdo, sound, was, a, race, to, avoid, starvation, and, they, were, restricted, to, half, rations, for, much, of, the, duration, at, one, point, shackleton, gave, his, one, biscuit, allotted, for, the, day, to, the, ailing, frank, wild, who, wrote, in, his, diary, all, the, money, that, was, ever, minted, would, not, have, bought, that, biscuit, and, the, remembrance, of, that, sacrifice, will, never, leave, me, the, party, arrived, back, at, hut, point, just, in, time, to, catch, the, ship, the, other, main, accomplishments, of, the, british, antarctic, expedition, included, the, first, ascent, of, mount, erebus, and, the, discovery, of, the, approximate, location, of, the, south, magnetic, pole, attained, by, edgeworth, david, douglas, mawson, and, alistair, mackay, on, 16, january, 1909, shackleton, returned, to, the, united, kingdom, as, a, hero, and, soon, afterwards, published, his, account, of, the, expedition, the, heart, of, the, antarctic, his, wife, emily, later, recorded, the, only, comment, he, made, to, me, about, not, reaching, the, pole, was, a, live, donkey, is, better, than, a, dead, lion, isn, t, it, and, i, said, yes, darling, as, far, as, i, am, concerned, and, we, left, it, at, that, in, 1910, shackleton, made, a, series, of, three, recordings, using, an, edison, phonograph, in, which, he, briefly, described, the, expedition, in, 2010, several, mostly, intact, cases, of, whisky, and, brandy, that, had, been, left, behind, in, 1909, were, recovered, for, analysis, by, a, distilling, company, a, revival, of, the, vintage, formula, for, the, particular, brands, found, was, offered, for, sale, with, a, portion, of, the, proceeds, donated, to, the, new, zealand, antarctic, heritage, trust, which, had, discovered, the, lost, spirits, on, shackleton, s, return, home, public, honours, were, quickly, forthcoming, he, was, received, by, king, edward, vii, on, 10, july, 1909, and, raised, to, a, commander, of, the, royal, victorian, order, he, received, a, knighthood, in, the, king, s, birthday, honours, list, in, november, becoming, sir, ernest, shackleton, the, rgs, awarded, him, a, gold, medal, a, proposal, to, present, him, with, a, smaller, medal, than, that, earlier, awarded, to, captain, scott, was, not, acted, on, each, member, of, the, nimrod, expedition, shore, party, received, a, silver, polar, medal, on, 23, november, shackleton, himself, receiving, a, clasp, to, attach, to, his, earlier, medal, he, was, also, appointed, a, younger, brother, of, trinity, house, a, significant, honour, for, british, mariners, besides, the, official, honours, bestowed, on, shackleton, his, antarctic, feats, were, greeted, in, britain, with, great, enthusiasm, proposing, a, toast, to, shackleton, at, a, lunch, given, in, his, honour, by, the, royal, societies, club, lord, halsbury, a, former, lord, chancellor, said, when, one, remembers, what, he, had, gone, through, one, does, not, believe, in, the, supposed, degeneration, of, the, british, race, one, does, not, believe, that, we, have, lost, all, sense, of, admiration, for, courage, endurance, the, heroism, was, also, claimed, by, ireland, the, dublin, evening, telegraph, s, headline, read, south, pole, almost, reached, by, an, irishman, while, the, dublin, express, spoke, of, the, qualities, which, were, his, heritage, as, an, irishman, shackleton, s, fellow, polar, explorers, expressed, their, admiration, roald, amundsen, wrote, in, a, letter, to, rgs, secretary, john, scott, keltie, that, the, english, nation, has, by, this, deed, of, shackleton, s, won, a, victory, which, never, can, be, surpassed, fridtjof, nansen, sent, an, effusive, private, letter, to, shackleton, s, wife, praising, the, unique, expedition, which, has, been, such, a, complete, success, in, every, respect, the, reality, was, that, the, expedition, had, left, shackleton, deeply, in, debt, unable, to, meet, the, financial, guarantees, he, had, given, to, backers, despite, his, efforts, it, required, government, action, in, the, form, of, a, grant, of, 20, 000, equivalent, to, 2, 578, 822, in, 2023, to, clear, the, most, pressing, obligations, and, it, is, likely, that, many, of, his, debts, were, written, off, in, the, period, immediately, after, his, return, shackleton, engaged, in, a, strenuous, schedule, of, public, appearances, lectures, and, social, engagements, he, then, sought, to, cash, in, on, his, celebrity, by, making, a, fortune, in, the, world, of, business, among, the, ventures, that, he, hoped, to, promote, were, a, tobacco, company, a, scheme, for, selling, special, postage, stamps, to, collectors, overprinted, king, edward, vii, land, based, on, his, appointment, as, antarctic, postmaster, by, the, new, zealand, authorities, and, the, development, of, a, hungarian, mining, concession, he, had, acquired, near, the, city, of, nagybanya, now, part, of, romania, as, none, of, these, enterprises, prospered, shackleton, s, main, source, of, income, was, his, earnings, from, lecture, tours, he, still, harboured, thoughts, of, returning, south, even, though, in, september, 1910, having, recently, moved, with, his, family, to, sheringham, in, norfolk, he, wrote, to, emily, i, am, never, again, going, south, and, i, have, thought, it, all, out, and, my, place, is, at, home, now, he, had, been, in, discussions, with, douglas, mawson, about, a, scientific, expedition, to, the, antarctic, coast, between, cape, adare, and, gaussberg, and, had, written, to, the, rgs, about, this, in, february, 1910, any, future, resumption, by, shackleton, of, his, quest, for, the, south, pole, depended, on, the, results, of, scott, s, terra, nova, expedition, which, had, sailed, from, cardiff, on, 15, june, 1910, by, early, 1912, the, world, was, aware, that, the, pole, had, been, conquered, by, the, norwegian, roald, amundsen, but, the, fate, of, scott, s, expedition, was, not, then, known, shackleton, s, mind, turned, to, a, project, that, had, been, announced, and, then, abandoned, by, the, british, explorer, william, speirs, bruce, for, a, continental, crossing, via, the, south, pole, starting, from, a, landing, point, in, the, weddell, sea, and, ending, in, mcmurdo, sound, bruce, had, failed, to, acquire, financial, backing, and, was, happy, for, shackleton, to, adopt, his, plans, which, were, similar, to, those, being, followed, by, the, german, explorer, wilhelm, filchner, who, had, left, bremerhaven, in, may, 1911, in, december, 1912, the, news, arrived, from, south, georgia, that, filchner, s, expedition, had, failed, in, shackleton, s, own, words, the, transcontinental, journey, was, the, one, great, main, object, of, antarctic, journeyings, remaining, and, now, open, to, him, in, december, 1913, shackleton, published, details, of, his, new, expedition, grandly, titled, the, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, there, is, a, legend, that, shackleton, posted, an, advertisement, emphasising, the, hardship, and, danger, of, the, planned, voyage, so, that, he, could, better, narrow, down, the, selection, of, candidates, for, his, expedition, but, no, record, of, any, such, advertisement, has, survived, and, its, existence, is, considered, doubtful, two, ships, were, to, be, employed, endurance, would, carry, the, main, party, into, the, weddell, sea, aiming, for, vahsel, bay, from, where, a, team, of, six, led, by, shackleton, would, begin, the, crossing, of, the, continent, meanwhile, a, second, ship, the, aurora, would, take, a, supporting, party, under, captain, aeneas, mackintosh, to, mcmurdo, sound, on, the, far, side, of, the, continent, this, party, would, be, tasked, with, laying, supply, depots, across, the, great, ice, barrier, as, far, as, the, beardmore, glacier, the, depots, holding, the, food, and, fuel, required, to, enable, shackleton, s, party, to, complete, their, journey, of, 1, 800, miles, 2, 900, km, across, the, continent, shackleton, employed, his, considerable, fund, raising, skills, to, support, the, expedition, which, was, financed, largely, by, private, donations, although, the, british, government, gave, 10, 000, equivalent, to, 1, 212, 201, in, 2023, scottish, jute, magnate, sir, james, caird, donated, 24, 000, midlands, industrialist, frank, dudley, docker, gave, 10, 000, and, tobacco, heiress, janet, stancomb, wills, gave, an, undisclosed, but, reportedly, generous, sum, there, was, considerable, public, interest, shackleton, received, more, than, 5, 000, applications, to, join, his, expedition, at, times, his, interviewing, and, selection, methods, seemed, eccentric, believing, that, character, and, temperament, were, as, important, as, technical, ability, his, questions, were, unconventional, physicist, reginald, james, was, asked, if, he, could, sing, others, were, accepted, on, sight, because, shackleton, liked, the, look, of, them, or, after, the, briefest, of, interrogations, he, loosened, some, of, the, traditional, hierarchies, to, promote, camaraderie, such, as, distributing, the, ship, s, chores, equally, among, officers, scientists, and, able, seamen, he, made, a, point, of, socialising, with, his, crew, members, every, evening, after, dinner, leading, sing, alongs, jokes, and, games, he, finally, selected, a, crew, of, fifty, six, shared, equally, twenty, eight, men, on, each, ship, despite, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, on, 3, august, 1914, endurance, was, directed, by, the, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, winston, churchill, to, proceed, and, left, british, waters, on, 8, august, shackleton, delayed, his, own, departure, until, 27, september, meeting, the, ship, in, buenos, aires, on, setting, sail, for, south, georgia, at, the, end, of, october, he, sent, a, cablegram, to, the, daily, chronicle, conveying, the, patriotic, message, we, hope, in, our, small, way, to, add, victories, in, science, and, discovery, to, that, certain, victory, which, our, nation, will, achieve, in, the, cause, of, honor, and, liberty, while, shackleton, led, the, expedition, captain, frank, worsley, commanded, the, endurance, and, captain, aeneas, mackintosh, the, aurora, on, the, endurance, the, second, in, command, was, the, experienced, explorer, frank, wild, and, the, first, officer, was, lionel, greenstreet, the, meteorologist, was, leonard, hussey, who, was, also, an, able, banjo, player, surgeon, james, mcilroy, was, head, of, the, scientific, staff, which, included, geologist, james, wordie, alexander, macklin, was, the, second, of, the, two, surgeons, also, in, charge, of, keeping, the, 70, dogs, healthy, tom, crean, was, in, more, immediate, charge, as, head, dog, handler, other, crew, included, navigator, hubert, hudson, physicist, reginald, james, a, carpenter, harry, mcnish, and, a, biologist, named, robert, clark, of, later, independent, fame, was, the, expedition, s, official, photographer, frank, hurley, known, on, this, mission, for, his, perilous, shots, perce, blackborow, was, a, nineteen, year, old, welsh, sailor, who, had, stowed, away, on, the, ship, after, being, refused, a, job, although, angered, by, this, shackleton, realised, it, was, too, late, to, turn, back, by, the, time, the, situation, was, discovered, so, blackborow, was, allowed, to, join, the, crew, and, assigned, to, the, ship, s, galley, there, was, a, male, cat, onboard, named, mrs, chippy, that, belonged, to, the, carpenter, harry, mcnish, mrs, chippy, was, shot, when, the, endurance, sank, due, to, the, belief, that, he, would, not, have, survived, the, ordeal, that, followed, endurance, departed, from, south, georgia, for, the, weddell, sea, on, 5, december, 1914, heading, for, vahsel, bay, as, the, ship, moved, southward, navigating, in, ice, she, encountered, first, year, ice, which, slowed, progress, deep, in, the, weddell, sea, conditions, gradually, grew, worse, until, on, 19, january, 1915, endurance, became, frozen, fast, in, an, ice, floe, on, 24, february, realising, that, they, would, be, trapped, until, the, following, spring, shackleton, ordered, the, abandonment, of, the, ship, s, routine, and, her, conversion, to, a, winter, station, endurance, drifted, slowly, northward, with, the, ice, through, the, following, months, when, spring, arrived, in, september, the, breaking, of, the, ice, and, its, later, movements, put, extreme, pressure, on, the, ship, s, hull, shackleton, had, been, hoping, that, the, ship, when, released, from, the, ice, could, work, her, way, back, towards, vahsel, bay, but, his, hopes, were, dashed, on, 24, october, when, water, began, pouring, in, after, a, few, days, with, the, position, at, 69, 5, s, 51, 30, w, he, gave, the, order, to, abandon, ship, saying, she, s, going, down, and, men, provisions, and, equipment, were, transferred, to, camps, on, the, ice, on, 21, november, 1915, the, wreck, of, endurance, finally, slipped, beneath, the, surface, for, almost, two, months, shackleton, and, his, party, camped, on, a, large, flat, floe, hoping, that, it, would, drift, towards, paulet, island, approximately, 250, miles, 402, km, away, where, it, was, known, that, stores, were, cached, after, failed, attempts, to, march, across, the, ice, to, this, island, shackleton, decided, to, set, up, another, more, permanent, camp, patience, camp, on, another, floe, and, trust, to, the, drift, of, the, ice, to, take, them, towards, a, safe, landing, by, 17, march, their, ice, camp, was, within, 60, miles, 97, km, of, paulet, island, however, separated, by, impassable, ice, they, were, unable, to, reach, it, on, 9, april, their, ice, floe, broke, into, two, and, shackleton, ordered, the, crew, into, the, lifeboats, and, to, head, for, the, nearest, land, after, five, harrowing, days, at, sea, the, exhausted, men, landed, their, three, lifeboats, at, elephant, island, 346, miles, 557, km, from, where, the, endurance, had, sunk, this, was, the, first, time, they, had, set, foot, on, solid, ground, for, 497, days, shackleton, s, concern, for, his, men, was, such, that, he, gave, his, mittens, to, photographer, frank, hurley, who, had, lost, his, own, mittens, during, the, boat, journey, shackleton, suffered, frostbitten, fingers, as, a, result, elephant, island, was, an, inhospitable, place, far, from, any, shipping, routes, rescue, by, means, of, a, chance, discovery, was, very, unlikely, so, shackleton, decided, to, risk, an, open, boat, journey, to, the, south, georgia, whaling, stations, where, he, knew, help, would, be, available, the, strongest, of, the, tiny, 20, foot, 6, 1, m, lifeboats, christened, james, caird, after, the, expedition, s, chief, sponsor, was, chosen, for, the, trip, ship, s, carpenter, harry, mcnish, made, various, improvements, which, included, raising, the, sides, strengthening, the, keel, building, a, makeshift, deck, of, wood, and, canvas, and, sealing, the, work, with, oil, paint, and, seal, blood, shackleton, chose, five, companions, for, the, journey, the, ship, s, captain, frank, worsley, who, would, be, responsible, for, navigation, tom, crean, who, had, begged, to, go, two, strong, sailors, in, john, vincent, and, timothy, mccarthy, and, mcnish, the, carpenter, had, earlier, clashed, with, shackleton, when, the, party, was, stranded, on, the, ice, but, while, not, forgetting, his, earlier, insubordination, shackleton, recognised, mcnish, s, value, for, this, particular, job, shackleton, insisted, on, packing, only, enough, supplies, to, last, for, four, weeks, knowing, that, if, they, failed, to, reach, south, georgia, within, that, time, the, boat, and, its, crew, would, be, lost, the, james, caird, was, launched, on, 24, april, 1916, during, the, next, fifteen, days, it, sailed, through, the, waters, of, the, southern, ocean, at, the, mercy, of, the, stormy, seas, and, in, peril, of, capsizing, thanks, to, worsley, s, navigational, skills, the, cliffs, of, south, georgia, came, into, sight, on, 8, may, but, hurricane, force, winds, prevented, any, possibility, of, landing, the, party, was, forced, to, ride, out, the, storm, offshore, in, continual, danger, of, being, dashed, against, the, rocks, they, later, learned, that, the, same, storm, had, sunk, a, 500, ton, steamer, bound, for, south, georgia, from, buenos, aires, the, next, day, they, were, able, to, land, on, the, unoccupied, southern, shore, and, a, period, of, rest, and, recuperation, followed, rather, than, risking, another, sea, journey, to, reach, the, whaling, stations, on, the, northern, coast, shackleton, decided, to, attempt, a, land, crossing, of, the, island, although, it, is, likely, that, norwegian, whalers, had, already, crossed, the, island, at, other, points, on, ski, no, one, had, previously, attempted, this, particular, route, for, their, journey, the, men, were, only, equipped, with, boots, they, had, adapted, for, climbing, by, pushing, screws, into, the, soles, a, carpenter, s, adze, and, 50, feet, 15, m, of, rope, leaving, mcnish, vincent, and, mccarthy, at, the, landing, point, on, south, georgia, shackleton, travelled, with, worsley, and, crean, over, 32, miles, 51, km, of, dangerous, mountainous, terrain, for, 36, hours, reaching, the, whaling, station, at, stromness, on, 20, may, the, next, successful, crossing, of, south, georgia, was, in, october, 1955, by, the, british, explorer, duncan, carse, who, travelled, much, of, the, same, route, as, shackleton, s, party, in, tribute, to, their, achievement, he, wrote, i, do, not, know, how, they, did, it, except, that, they, had, to, three, men, of, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, with, 50, feet, of, rope, between, them, and, a, carpenter, s, adze, shackleton, immediately, sent, a, boat, to, pick, up, the, three, men, from, the, other, side, of, south, georgia, island, while, he, set, to, work, organising, the, rescue, of, those, left, behind, on, elephant, island, his, first, three, attempts, were, foiled, by, sea, ice, which, blocked, the, approaches, to, the, island, he, appealed, to, the, chilean, government, and, was, offered, the, use, of, the, yelcho, a, small, seagoing, tug, from, the, chilean, navy, yelcho, commanded, by, captain, luis, pardo, and, the, british, whaler, southern, sky, reached, elephant, island, on, 30, august, 1916, at, which, point, the, men, had, been, isolated, there, for, four, and, a, half, months, shackleton, quickly, evacuated, all, 22, men, the, party, was, taken, on, yelcho, first, to, punta, arenas, and, after, some, days, to, valpara, so, in, chile, where, crowds, warmly, welcomed, them, back, to, civilisation, at, the, same, time, the, endurance, suffered, these, perils, the, aurora, the, expedition, supporting, component, also, suffered, misfortune, the, remaining, men, of, the, ross, sea, party, had, been, stranded, at, cape, evans, in, mcmurdo, sound, when, the, aurora, was, blown, from, its, anchorage, and, driven, out, to, sea, unable, to, return, after, a, drift, of, many, months, the, ship, had, returned, to, new, zealand, shackleton, travelled, there, to, join, aurora, and, sailed, with, her, to, rescue, the, ross, sea, party, which, despite, many, hardships, had, successfully, completed, its, depot, laying, mission, however, three, lives, had, been, lost, including, that, of, its, commander, aeneas, mackintosh, europe, was, in, the, midst, of, the, first, world, war, when, shackleton, returned, to, england, in, may, 1917, suffering, from, a, heart, condition, made, worse, by, the, fatigue, of, his, arduous, journeys, and, too, old, to, be, conscripted, he, nevertheless, volunteered, for, the, british, army, he, repeatedly, requested, posting, to, the, front, in, france, and, was, by, now, drinking, heavily, in, october, 1917, shackleton, was, sent, to, buenos, aires, to, boost, british, propaganda, in, south, america, unqualified, as, a, diplomat, he, was, unsuccessful, in, persuading, argentina, and, chile, to, enter, the, war, on, the, allied, side, and, he, returned, home, in, april, 1918, he, was, then, briefly, involved, in, a, mission, to, spitzbergen, to, establish, a, british, presence, there, under, the, guise, of, a, mining, operation, on, the, way, he, was, taken, ill, in, troms, possibly, with, a, heart, attack, he, was, then, appointed, to, a, military, expedition, to, murmansk, which, obliged, him, to, return, home, again, before, departing, for, northern, russia, shackleton, was, specially, appointed, a, temporary, major, on, 22, july, 1918, from, october, 1918, he, served, with, the, north, russia, expeditionary, force, in, the, russian, civil, war, under, the, command, of, major, general, edmund, ironside, with, the, role, of, advising, on, the, equipment, and, training, of, british, forces, in, arctic, conditions, for, his, valuable, services, rendered, in, connection, with, military, operations, in, north, russia, shackleton, was, appointed, an, officer, of, the, order, of, the, british, empire, in, the, 1919, king, s, birthday, honours, and, he, was, also, mentioned, in, despatches, by, general, ironside, returning, to, england, in, early, march, 1919, he, was, full, of, plans, for, the, economic, development, of, northern, russia, in, the, midst, of, seeking, capital, his, plans, foundered, when, northern, russia, fell, to, bolshevik, control, shackleton, was, finally, discharged, from, the, army, in, october, 1919, retaining, his, rank, of, major, shackleton, returned, to, the, lecture, circuit, and, in, december, 1919, he, published, his, own, account, of, the, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, titled, south, in, 1920, tired, of, public, speaking, he, began, to, consider, the, possibility, of, a, last, expedition, he, thought, seriously, of, going, to, the, beaufort, sea, area, of, the, arctic, a, largely, unexplored, region, and, raised, some, interest, in, this, idea, from, the, canadian, government, with, funds, supplied, by, former, schoolfriend, john, quiller, rowett, shackleton, acquired, a, 125, ton, norwegian, sealer, named, foca, i, which, he, renamed, quest, the, plan, changed, the, destination, became, the, antarctic, and, the, project, was, defined, by, shackleton, as, an, oceanographic, and, sub, antarctic, expedition, the, goals, of, the, venture, were, imprecise, but, a, circumnavigation, of, the, antarctic, continent, and, investigation, of, some, lost, sub, antarctic, islands, such, as, tuanaki, were, mentioned, as, objectives, rowett, agreed, to, finance, the, entire, expedition, which, became, known, as, the, shackleton, rowett, expedition, on, 16, september, 1921, shackleton, recorded, a, farewell, address, on, a, sound, on, film, system, created, by, harry, grindell, matthews, who, claimed, it, was, the, first, talking, picture, ever, made, the, expedition, left, england, on, 24, september, 1921, although, some, of, shackleton, s, former, crew, members, had, not, received, all, of, their, pay, from, the, endurance, expedition, many, of, them, signed, on, with, their, erstwhile, boss, when, the, party, arrived, in, rio, de, janeiro, shackleton, suffered, a, suspected, heart, attack, he, refused, to, have, a, proper, medical, examination, and, quest, continued, south, arriving, at, south, georgia, on, 4, january, 1922, in, the, early, hours, of, the, next, morning, shackleton, summoned, to, his, cabin, the, expedition, s, physician, alexander, macklin, complaining, of, back, pains, and, other, discomfort, according, to, macklin, s, own, account, he, told, shackleton, that, he, had, been, overdoing, things, and, should, try, to, lead, a, more, regular, life, to, which, shackleton, answered, you, are, always, wanting, me, to, give, up, things, what, is, it, i, ought, to, give, up, macklin, replied, chiefly, alcohol, boss, a, few, moments, later, at, 2, 50, a, m, on, 5, january, 1922, shackleton, suffered, a, fatal, heart, attack, after, carrying, out, the, post, mortem, macklin, concluded, that, the, cause, of, death, was, atheroma, of, the, coronary, arteries, exacerbated, by, overstrain, during, a, period, of, debility, contemporary, study, of, diaries, kept, by, eric, marshall, medical, officer, to, the, 1907, 1909, expedition, suggests, that, shackleton, suffered, from, an, atrial, septal, defect, hole, in, the, heart, a, congenital, heart, defect, which, may, have, been, a, cause, of, his, health, problems, leonard, hussey, a, veteran, of, the, imperial, trans, antarctic, expedition, offered, to, accompany, shackleton, s, body, back, to, britain, but, while, he, was, in, montevideo, en, route, to, england, a, message, was, received, from, emily, shackleton, asking, that, her, husband, be, buried, in, south, georgia, hussey, returned, to, south, georgia, with, the, body, on, the, steamer, woodville, and, on, 5, march, 1922, shackleton, was, buried, in, the, grytviken, cemetery, after, a, short, service, in, the, lutheran, church, with, edward, binnie, officiating, macklin, wrote, in, his, diary, i, think, this, is, as, the, boss, would, have, had, it, himself, standing, lonely, on, an, island, far, from, civilization, surrounded, by, a, stormy, tempestuous, sea, and, in, the, vicinity, of, one, of, his, greatest, exploits, shackleton, s, will, was, proven, in, london, on, 12, may, 1922, he, died, heavily, in, debt, his, small, estate, consisting, of, personal, effects, to, the, value, of, 556, equivalent, to, 38, 349, in, 2023, lady, shackleton, died, in, 1936, having, survived, her, husband, by, fourteen, years, on, 27, november, 2011, the, ashes, of, frank, wild, were, interred, on, the, right, hand, side, of, shackleton, s, gravesite, in, grytviken, the, inscription, on, the, rough, hewn, granite, block, set, to, mark, the, spot, reads, frank, wild, 1873, 1939, shackleton, s, right, hand, man, in, june, 2024, wreck, hunters, found, quest, the, vessel, on, which, shackleton, made, his, final, voyage, she, was, found, on, the, seafloor, off, the, coast, of, newfoundland, canada, by, a, team, led, by, the, royal, canadian, geographical, society, rcgs, the, ship, was, found, intact, lying, at, a, depth, of, 390, metres, 1, 280, ft, before, the, return, of, shackleton, s, body, to, south, georgia, there, was, a, memorial, service, held, for, him, with, full, military, honours, at, holy, trinity, church, montevideo, and, a, service, was, held, on, 2, march, 1922, at, st, paul, s, cathedral, london, at, which, king, george, v, and, other, members, of, the, royal, family, were, represented, within, a, year, the, first, biography, was, published, the, life, of, sir, ernest, shackleton, by, hugh, robert, mill, as, well, as, being, a, tribute, to, the, explorer, this, book, was, a, practical, effort, to, assist, his, family, shackleton, had, died, some, 40, 000, in, debt, equivalent, to, 2, 758, 944, in, 2023, a, further, initiative, was, the, formation, of, a, shackleton, memorial, fund, which, was, used, to, assist, with, his, children, s, education, and, the, support, of, his, mother, shackleton, s, death, marked, the, end, of, the, heroic, age, of, antarctic, exploration, a, period, of, discovery, characterised, by, journeys, of, geographical, and, scientific, exploration, in, a, largely, unknown, continent, without, any, of, the, benefits, of, modern, travel, methods, or, radio, communication, none, of, his, voyages, achieved, its, primary, objective, and, over, the, ensuing, decades, his, status, as, a, polar, hero, was, generally, outshone, by, that, of, scott, whose, polar, party, had, by, 1925, been, commemorated, on, more, than, 30, monuments, in, britain, alone, including, stained, glass,
