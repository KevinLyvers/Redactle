alan, mathison, turing, obe, frs, tj, r, 23, june, 1912, 7, june, 1954, was, an, english, mathematician, computer, scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and, theoretical, biologist, he, was, highly, influential, in, the, development, of, theoretical, computer, science, providing, a, formalisation, of, the, concepts, of, algorithm, and, computation, with, the, turing, machine, which, can, be, considered, a, model, of, a, general, purpose, computer, turing, is, widely, considered, to, be, the, father, of, theoretical, computer, science, born, in, london, turing, was, raised, in, southern, england, he, graduated, from, king, s, college, cambridge, and, in, 1938, earned, a, doctorate, degree, from, princeton, university, during, world, war, ii, turing, worked, for, the, government, code, and, cypher, school, at, bletchley, park, britain, s, codebreaking, centre, that, produced, ultra, intelligence, he, led, hut, 8, the, section, responsible, for, german, naval, cryptanalysis, turing, devised, techniques, for, speeding, the, breaking, of, german, ciphers, including, improvements, to, the, pre, war, polish, bomba, method, an, electromechanical, machine, that, could, find, settings, for, the, enigma, machine, he, played, a, crucial, role, in, cracking, intercepted, messages, that, enabled, the, allies, to, defeat, the, axis, powers, in, many, crucial, engagements, including, the, battle, of, the, atlantic, after, the, war, turing, worked, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, where, he, designed, the, automatic, computing, engine, one, of, the, first, designs, for, a, stored, program, computer, in, 1948, turing, joined, max, newman, s, computing, machine, laboratory, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, where, he, helped, develop, the, manchester, computers, and, became, interested, in, mathematical, biology, turing, wrote, on, the, chemical, basis, of, morphogenesis, and, predicted, oscillating, chemical, reactions, such, as, the, belousov, zhabotinsky, reaction, first, observed, in, the, 1960s, despite, these, accomplishments, he, was, never, fully, recognised, during, his, lifetime, because, much, of, his, work, was, covered, by, the, official, secrets, act, in, 1952, turing, was, prosecuted, for, homosexual, acts, he, accepted, hormone, treatment, a, procedure, commonly, referred, to, as, chemical, castration, as, an, alternative, to, prison, turing, died, on, 7, june, 1954, aged, 41, from, cyanide, poisoning, an, inquest, determined, his, death, as, suicide, but, the, evidence, is, also, consistent, with, accidental, poisoning, following, a, campaign, in, 2009, british, prime, minister, gordon, brown, made, an, official, public, apology, for, the, appalling, way, was, treated, queen, elizabeth, ii, granted, a, pardon, in, 2013, the, term, alan, turing, law, is, used, informally, to, refer, to, a, 2017, law, in, the, uk, that, retroactively, pardoned, men, cautioned, or, convicted, under, historical, legislation, that, outlawed, homosexual, acts, turing, left, an, extensive, legacy, in, mathematics, and, computing, which, today, is, recognised, more, widely, with, statues, and, many, things, named, after, him, including, an, annual, award, for, computing, innovation, his, portrait, appears, on, the, bank, of, england, 50, note, first, released, on, 23, june, 2021, to, coincide, with, his, birthday, the, audience, vote, in, a, 2019, bbc, series, named, turing, the, greatest, person, of, the, 20th, century, turing, was, born, in, maida, vale, london, while, his, father, julius, mathison, turing, was, on, leave, from, his, position, with, the, indian, civil, service, ics, of, the, british, raj, government, at, chatrapur, then, in, the, madras, presidency, and, presently, in, odisha, state, in, india, turing, s, father, was, the, son, of, a, clergyman, the, rev, john, robert, turing, from, a, scottish, family, of, merchants, that, had, been, based, in, the, netherlands, and, included, a, baronet, turing, s, mother, julius, s, wife, was, ethel, sara, turing, n, e, stoney, daughter, of, edward, waller, stoney, chief, engineer, of, the, madras, railways, the, stoneys, were, a, protestant, anglo, irish, gentry, family, from, both, county, tipperary, and, county, longford, while, ethel, herself, had, spent, much, of, her, childhood, in, county, clare, julius, and, ethel, married, on, 1, october, 1907, at, the, church, of, ireland, st, bartholomew, s, church, on, clyde, road, in, ballsbridge, dublin, julius, s, work, with, the, ics, brought, the, family, to, british, india, where, his, grandfather, had, been, a, general, in, the, bengal, army, however, both, julius, and, ethel, wanted, their, children, to, be, brought, up, in, britain, so, they, moved, to, maida, vale, london, where, alan, turing, was, born, on, 23, june, 1912, as, recorded, by, a, blue, plaque, on, the, outside, of, the, house, of, his, birth, later, the, colonnade, hotel, turing, had, an, elder, brother, john, ferrier, turing, father, of, sir, john, dermot, turing, 12th, baronet, of, the, turing, baronets, turing, s, father, s, civil, service, commission, was, still, active, during, turing, s, childhood, years, and, his, parents, travelled, between, hastings, in, the, united, kingdom, and, india, leaving, their, two, sons, to, stay, with, a, retired, army, couple, at, hastings, turing, stayed, at, baston, lodge, upper, maze, hill, st, leonards, on, sea, now, marked, with, a, blue, plaque, the, plaque, was, unveiled, on, 23, june, 2012, the, centenary, of, turing, s, birth, very, early, in, life, turing, s, parents, purchased, a, house, in, guildford, in, 1927, and, turing, lived, there, during, school, holidays, the, location, is, also, marked, with, a, blue, plaque, turing, s, parents, enrolled, him, at, st, michael, s, a, primary, school, at, 20, charles, road, st, leonards, on, sea, from, the, age, of, six, to, nine, the, headmistress, recognised, his, talent, noting, that, she, had, clever, boys, and, hardworking, boys, but, alan, is, a, genius, between, january, 1922, and, 1926, turing, was, educated, at, hazelhurst, preparatory, school, an, independent, school, in, the, village, of, frant, in, sussex, now, east, sussex, in, 1926, at, the, age, of, 13, he, went, on, to, sherborne, school, an, independent, boarding, school, in, the, market, town, of, sherborne, in, dorset, where, he, boarded, at, westcott, house, the, first, day, of, term, coincided, with, the, 1926, general, strike, in, britain, but, turing, was, so, determined, to, attend, that, he, rode, his, bicycle, unaccompanied, 60, miles, 97, km, from, southampton, to, sherborne, stopping, overnight, at, an, inn, turing, s, natural, inclination, towards, mathematics, and, science, did, not, earn, him, respect, from, some, of, the, teachers, at, sherborne, whose, definition, of, education, placed, more, emphasis, on, the, classics, his, headmaster, wrote, to, his, parents, i, hope, he, will, not, fall, between, two, stools, if, he, is, to, stay, at, public, school, he, must, aim, at, becoming, educated, if, he, is, to, be, solely, a, scientific, specialist, he, is, wasting, his, time, at, a, public, school, despite, this, turing, continued, to, show, remarkable, ability, in, the, studies, he, loved, solving, advanced, problems, in, 1927, without, having, studied, even, elementary, calculus, in, 1928, aged, 16, turing, encountered, albert, einstein, s, work, not, only, did, he, grasp, it, but, it, is, possible, that, he, managed, to, deduce, einstein, s, questioning, of, newton, s, laws, of, motion, from, a, text, in, which, this, was, never, made, explicit, at, sherborne, turing, formed, a, significant, friendship, with, fellow, pupil, christopher, collan, morcom, 13, july, 1911, 13, february, 1930, who, has, been, described, as, turing, s, first, love, their, relationship, provided, inspiration, in, turing, s, future, endeavours, but, it, was, cut, short, by, morcom, s, death, in, february, 1930, from, complications, of, bovine, tuberculosis, contracted, after, drinking, infected, cow, s, milk, some, years, previously, the, event, caused, turing, great, sorrow, he, coped, with, his, grief, by, working, that, much, harder, on, the, topics, of, science, and, mathematics, that, he, had, shared, with, morcom, in, a, letter, to, morcom, s, mother, frances, isobel, morcom, n, e, swan, turing, wrote, i, am, sure, i, could, not, have, found, anywhere, another, companion, so, brilliant, and, yet, so, charming, and, unconceited, i, regarded, my, interest, in, my, work, and, in, such, things, as, astronomy, to, which, he, introduced, me, as, something, to, be, shared, with, him, and, i, think, he, felt, a, little, the, same, about, me, i, know, i, must, put, as, much, energy, if, not, as, much, interest, into, my, work, as, if, he, were, alive, because, that, is, what, he, would, like, me, to, do, turing, s, relationship, with, morcom, s, mother, continued, long, after, morcom, s, death, with, her, sending, gifts, to, turing, and, him, sending, letters, typically, on, morcom, s, birthday, a, day, before, the, third, anniversary, of, morcom, s, death, 13, february, 1933, he, wrote, to, mrs, morcom, i, expect, you, will, be, thinking, of, chris, when, this, reaches, you, i, shall, too, and, this, letter, is, just, to, tell, you, that, i, shall, be, thinking, of, chris, and, of, you, tomorrow, i, am, sure, that, he, is, as, happy, now, as, he, was, when, he, was, here, your, affectionate, alan, some, have, speculated, that, morcom, s, death, was, the, cause, of, turing, s, atheism, and, materialism, apparently, at, this, point, in, his, life, he, still, believed, in, such, concepts, as, a, spirit, independent, of, the, body, and, surviving, death, in, a, later, letter, also, written, to, morcom, s, mother, turing, wrote, personally, i, believe, that, spirit, is, really, eternally, connected, with, matter, but, certainly, not, by, the, same, kind, of, body, as, regards, the, actual, connection, between, spirit, and, body, i, consider, that, the, body, can, hold, on, to, a, spirit, whilst, the, body, is, alive, and, awake, the, two, are, firmly, connected, when, the, body, is, asleep, i, cannot, guess, what, happens, but, when, the, body, dies, the, mechanism, of, the, body, holding, the, spirit, is, gone, and, the, spirit, finds, a, new, body, sooner, or, later, perhaps, immediately, after, graduating, from, sherborne, turing, applied, for, several, cambridge, colleges, scholarships, including, trinity, and, king, s, eventually, earning, an, 80, per, annum, scholarship, equivalent, to, about, 4, 300, as, of, 2023, to, study, at, the, latter, there, turing, studied, the, undergraduate, course, in, schedule, b, that, is, a, three, year, parts, i, and, ii, of, the, mathematical, tripos, with, extra, courses, at, the, end, of, the, third, year, as, part, iii, only, emerged, as, a, separate, degree, in, 1934, from, february, 1931, to, november, 1934, at, king, s, college, cambridge, where, he, was, awarded, first, class, honours, in, mathematics, his, dissertation, on, the, gaussian, error, function, written, during, his, senior, year, and, delivered, in, november, 1934, with, a, deadline, date, of, 6, december, proved, a, version, of, the, central, limit, theorem, it, was, finally, accepted, on, 16, march, 1935, by, spring, of, that, same, year, turing, started, his, master, s, course, part, iii, which, he, completed, in, 1937, and, at, the, same, time, he, published, his, first, paper, a, one, page, article, called, equivalence, of, left, and, right, almost, periodicity, sent, on, 23, april, featured, in, the, tenth, volume, of, the, journal, of, the, london, mathematical, society, later, that, year, turing, was, elected, a, fellow, of, king, s, college, on, the, strength, of, his, dissertation, where, he, served, as, a, lecturer, however, and, unknown, to, turing, this, version, of, the, theorem, he, proved, in, his, paper, had, already, been, proven, in, 1922, by, jarl, waldemar, lindeberg, despite, this, the, committee, found, turing, s, methods, original, and, so, regarded, the, work, worthy, of, consideration, for, the, fellowship, abram, besicovitch, s, report, for, the, committee, went, so, far, as, to, say, that, if, turing, s, work, had, been, published, before, lindeberg, s, it, would, have, been, an, important, event, in, the, mathematical, literature, of, that, year, between, the, springs, of, 1935, and, 1936, at, the, same, time, as, church, turing, worked, on, the, decidability, of, problems, starting, from, g, del, s, incompleteness, theorems, in, mid, april, 1936, turing, sent, max, newman, the, first, draft, typescript, of, his, investigations, that, same, month, alonzo, church, published, his, an, unsolvable, problem, of, elementary, number, theory, with, similar, conclusions, to, turing, s, then, yet, unpublished, work, finally, on, 28, may, of, that, year, he, finished, and, delivered, his, 36, page, paper, for, publication, called, on, computable, numbers, with, an, application, to, the, entscheidungsproblem, it, was, published, in, the, proceedings, of, the, london, mathematical, society, journal, in, two, parts, the, first, on, 30, november, and, the, second, on, 23, december, in, this, paper, turing, reformulated, kurt, g, del, s, 1931, results, on, the, limits, of, proof, and, computation, replacing, g, del, s, universal, arithmetic, based, formal, language, with, the, formal, and, simple, hypothetical, devices, that, became, known, as, turing, machines, the, entscheidungsproblem, decision, problem, was, originally, posed, by, german, mathematician, david, hilbert, in, 1928, turing, proved, that, his, universal, computing, machine, would, be, capable, of, performing, any, conceivable, mathematical, computation, if, it, were, representable, as, an, algorithm, he, went, on, to, prove, that, there, was, no, solution, to, the, decision, problem, by, first, showing, that, the, halting, problem, for, turing, machines, is, undecidable, it, is, not, possible, to, decide, algorithmically, whether, a, turing, machine, will, ever, halt, this, paper, has, been, called, easily, the, most, influential, math, paper, in, history, although, turing, s, proof, was, published, shortly, after, alonzo, church, s, equivalent, proof, using, his, lambda, calculus, turing, s, approach, is, considerably, more, accessible, and, intuitive, than, church, s, it, also, included, a, notion, of, a, universal, machine, now, known, as, a, universal, turing, machine, with, the, idea, that, such, a, machine, could, perform, the, tasks, of, any, other, computation, machine, as, indeed, could, church, s, lambda, calculus, according, to, the, church, turing, thesis, turing, machines, and, the, lambda, calculus, are, capable, of, computing, anything, that, is, computable, john, von, neumann, acknowledged, that, the, central, concept, of, the, modern, computer, was, due, to, turing, s, paper, to, this, day, turing, machines, are, a, central, object, of, study, in, theory, of, computation, from, september, 1936, to, july, 1938, turing, spent, most, of, his, time, studying, under, church, at, princeton, university, in, the, second, year, as, a, jane, eliza, procter, visiting, fellow, in, addition, to, his, purely, mathematical, work, he, studied, cryptology, and, also, built, three, of, four, stages, of, an, electro, mechanical, binary, multiplier, in, june, 1938, he, obtained, his, phd, from, the, department, of, mathematics, at, princeton, his, dissertation, systems, of, logic, based, on, ordinals, introduced, the, concept, of, ordinal, logic, and, the, notion, of, relative, computing, in, which, turing, machines, are, augmented, with, so, called, oracles, allowing, the, study, of, problems, that, cannot, be, solved, by, turing, machines, john, von, neumann, wanted, to, hire, him, as, his, postdoctoral, assistant, but, he, went, back, to, the, united, kingdom, when, turing, returned, to, cambridge, he, attended, lectures, given, in, 1939, by, ludwig, wittgenstein, about, the, foundations, of, mathematics, the, lectures, have, been, reconstructed, verbatim, including, interjections, from, turing, and, other, students, from, students, notes, turing, and, wittgenstein, argued, and, disagreed, with, turing, defending, formalism, and, wittgenstein, propounding, his, view, that, mathematics, does, not, discover, any, absolute, truths, but, rather, invents, them, during, the, second, world, war, turing, was, a, leading, participant, in, the, breaking, of, german, ciphers, at, bletchley, park, the, historian, and, wartime, codebreaker, asa, briggs, has, said, you, needed, exceptional, talent, you, needed, genius, at, bletchley, and, turing, s, was, that, genius, from, september, 1938, turing, worked, part, time, with, the, government, code, and, cypher, school, gc, cs, the, british, codebreaking, organisation, he, concentrated, on, cryptanalysis, of, the, enigma, cipher, machine, used, by, nazi, germany, together, with, dilly, knox, a, senior, gc, cs, codebreaker, soon, after, the, july, 1939, meeting, near, warsaw, at, which, the, polish, cipher, bureau, gave, the, british, and, french, details, of, the, wiring, of, enigma, machine, s, rotors, and, their, method, of, decrypting, enigma, machine, s, messages, turing, and, knox, developed, a, broader, solution, the, polish, method, relied, on, an, insecure, indicator, procedure, that, the, germans, were, likely, to, change, which, they, in, fact, did, in, may, 1940, turing, s, approach, was, more, general, using, crib, based, decryption, for, which, he, produced, the, functional, specification, of, the, bombe, an, improvement, on, the, polish, bomba, on, 4, september, 1939, the, day, after, the, uk, declared, war, on, germany, turing, reported, to, bletchley, park, the, wartime, station, of, gc, cs, like, all, others, who, came, to, bletchley, he, was, required, to, sign, the, official, secrets, act, in, which, he, agreed, not, to, disclose, anything, about, his, work, at, bletchley, with, severe, legal, penalties, for, violating, the, act, specifying, the, bombe, was, the, first, of, five, major, cryptanalytical, advances, that, turing, made, during, the, war, the, others, were, deducing, the, indicator, procedure, used, by, the, german, navy, developing, a, statistical, procedure, dubbed, banburismus, for, making, much, more, efficient, use, of, the, bombes, developing, a, procedure, dubbed, turingery, for, working, out, the, cam, settings, of, the, wheels, of, the, lorenz, sz, 40, 42, tunny, cipher, machine, and, towards, the, end, of, the, war, the, development, of, a, portable, secure, voice, scrambler, at, hanslope, park, that, was, codenamed, delilah, by, using, statistical, techniques, to, optimise, the, trial, of, different, possibilities, in, the, code, breaking, process, turing, made, an, innovative, contribution, to, the, subject, he, wrote, two, papers, discussing, mathematical, approaches, titled, the, applications, of, probability, to, cryptography, and, paper, on, statistics, of, repetitions, which, were, of, such, value, to, gc, cs, and, its, successor, gchq, that, they, were, not, released, to, the, uk, national, archives, until, april, 2012, shortly, before, the, centenary, of, his, birth, a, gchq, mathematician, who, identified, himself, only, as, richard, said, at, the, time, that, the, fact, that, the, contents, had, been, restricted, under, the, official, secrets, act, for, some, 70, years, demonstrated, their, importance, and, their, relevance, to, post, war, cryptanalysis, said, the, fact, that, the, contents, had, been, restricted, shows, what, a, tremendous, importance, it, has, in, the, foundations, of, our, subject, the, papers, detailed, using, mathematical, analysis, to, try, and, determine, which, are, the, more, likely, settings, so, that, they, can, be, tried, as, quickly, as, possible, richard, said, that, gchq, had, now, squeezed, the, juice, out, of, the, two, papers, and, was, happy, for, them, to, be, released, into, the, public, domain, turing, had, a, reputation, for, eccentricity, at, bletchley, park, he, was, known, to, his, colleagues, as, prof, and, his, treatise, on, enigma, was, known, as, the, prof, s, book, according, to, historian, ronald, lewin, jack, good, a, cryptanalyst, who, worked, with, turing, said, of, his, colleague, in, the, first, week, of, june, each, year, he, would, get, a, bad, attack, of, hay, fever, and, he, would, cycle, to, the, office, wearing, a, service, gas, mask, to, keep, the, pollen, off, his, bicycle, had, a, fault, the, chain, would, come, off, at, regular, intervals, instead, of, having, it, mended, he, would, count, the, number, of, times, the, pedals, went, round, and, would, get, off, the, bicycle, in, time, to, adjust, the, chain, by, hand, another, of, his, eccentricities, is, that, he, chained, his, mug, to, the, radiator, pipes, to, prevent, it, being, stolen, peter, hilton, recounted, his, experience, working, with, turing, in, hut, 8, in, his, reminiscences, of, bletchley, park, from, a, century, of, mathematics, in, america, it, is, a, rare, experience, to, meet, an, authentic, genius, those, of, us, privileged, to, inhabit, the, world, of, scholarship, are, familiar, with, the, intellectual, stimulation, furnished, by, talented, colleagues, we, can, admire, the, ideas, they, share, with, us, and, are, usually, able, to, understand, their, source, we, may, even, often, believe, that, we, ourselves, could, have, created, such, concepts, and, originated, such, thoughts, however, the, experience, of, sharing, the, intellectual, life, of, a, genius, is, entirely, different, one, realizes, that, one, is, in, the, presence, of, an, intelligence, a, sensibility, of, such, profundity, and, originality, that, one, is, filled, with, wonder, and, excitement, alan, turing, was, such, a, genius, and, those, like, myself, who, had, the, astonishing, and, unexpected, opportunity, created, by, the, strange, exigencies, of, the, second, world, war, to, be, able, to, count, turing, as, colleague, and, friend, will, never, forget, that, experience, nor, can, we, ever, lose, its, immense, benefit, to, us, hilton, echoed, similar, thoughts, in, the, nova, pbs, documentary, decoding, nazi, secrets, while, working, at, bletchley, turing, who, was, a, talented, long, distance, runner, occasionally, ran, the, 40, miles, 64, km, to, london, when, he, was, needed, for, meetings, and, he, was, capable, of, world, class, marathon, standards, turing, tried, out, for, the, 1948, british, olympic, team, but, he, was, hampered, by, an, injury, his, tryout, time, for, the, marathon, was, only, 11, minutes, slower, than, british, silver, medallist, thomas, richards, olympic, race, time, of, 2, hours, 35, minutes, he, was, walton, athletic, club, s, best, runner, a, fact, discovered, when, he, passed, the, group, while, running, alone, when, asked, why, he, ran, so, hard, in, training, he, replied, i, have, such, a, stressful, job, that, the, only, way, i, can, get, it, out, of, my, mind, is, by, running, hard, it, s, the, only, way, i, can, get, some, release, due, to, the, problems, of, counterfactual, history, it, is, hard, to, estimate, the, precise, effect, ultra, intelligence, had, on, the, war, however, official, war, historian, harry, hinsley, estimated, that, this, work, shortened, the, war, in, europe, by, more, than, two, years, and, saved, over, 14, million, lives, at, the, end, of, the, war, a, memo, was, sent, to, all, those, who, had, worked, at, bletchley, park, reminding, them, that, the, code, of, silence, dictated, by, the, official, secrets, act, did, not, end, with, the, war, but, would, continue, indefinitely, thus, even, though, turing, was, appointed, an, officer, of, the, order, of, the, british, empire, obe, in, 1946, by, king, george, vi, for, his, wartime, services, his, work, remained, secret, for, many, years, within, weeks, of, arriving, at, bletchley, park, turing, had, specified, an, electromechanical, machine, called, the, bombe, which, could, break, enigma, more, effectively, than, the, polish, bomba, kryptologiczna, from, which, its, name, was, derived, the, bombe, with, an, enhancement, suggested, by, mathematician, gordon, welchman, became, one, of, the, primary, tools, and, the, major, automated, one, used, to, attack, enigma, enciphered, messages, the, bombe, searched, for, possible, correct, settings, used, for, an, enigma, message, i, e, rotor, order, rotor, settings, and, plugboard, settings, using, a, suitable, crib, a, fragment, of, probable, plaintext, for, each, possible, setting, of, the, rotors, which, had, on, the, order, of, 10, 19, states, or, 10, 22, states, for, the, four, rotor, u, boat, variant, the, bombe, performed, a, chain, of, logical, deductions, based, on, the, crib, implemented, electromechanically, the, bombe, detected, when, a, contradiction, had, occurred, and, ruled, out, that, setting, moving, on, to, the, next, most, of, the, possible, settings, would, cause, contradictions, and, be, discarded, leaving, only, a, few, to, be, investigated, in, detail, a, contradiction, would, occur, when, an, enciphered, letter, would, be, turned, back, into, the, same, plaintext, letter, which, was, impossible, with, the, enigma, the, first, bombe, was, installed, on, 18, march, 1940, by, late, 1941, turing, and, his, fellow, cryptanalysts, gordon, welchman, hugh, alexander, and, stuart, milner, barry, were, frustrated, building, on, the, work, of, the, poles, they, had, set, up, a, good, working, system, for, decrypting, enigma, signals, but, their, limited, staff, and, bombes, meant, they, could, not, translate, all, the, signals, in, the, summer, they, had, considerable, success, and, shipping, losses, had, fallen, to, under, 100, 000, tons, a, month, however, they, badly, needed, more, resources, to, keep, abreast, of, german, adjustments, they, had, tried, to, get, more, people, and, fund, more, bombes, through, the, proper, channels, but, had, failed, on, 28, october, they, wrote, directly, to, winston, churchill, explaining, their, difficulties, with, turing, as, the, first, named, they, emphasised, how, small, their, need, was, compared, with, the, vast, expenditure, of, men, and, money, by, the, forces, and, compared, with, the, level, of, assistance, they, could, offer, to, the, forces, as, andrew, hodges, biographer, of, turing, later, wrote, this, letter, had, an, electric, effect, churchill, wrote, a, memo, to, general, ismay, which, read, action, this, day, make, sure, they, have, all, they, want, on, extreme, priority, and, report, to, me, that, this, has, been, done, on, 18, november, the, chief, of, the, secret, service, reported, that, every, possible, measure, was, being, taken, the, cryptographers, at, bletchley, park, did, not, know, of, the, prime, minister, s, response, but, as, milner, barry, recalled, all, that, we, did, notice, was, that, almost, from, that, day, the, rough, ways, began, miraculously, to, be, made, smooth, more, than, two, hundred, bombes, were, in, operation, by, the, end, of, the, war, turing, decided, to, tackle, the, particularly, difficult, problem, of, cracking, the, german, naval, use, of, enigma, because, no, one, else, was, doing, anything, about, it, and, i, could, have, it, to, myself, in, december, 1939, turing, solved, the, essential, part, of, the, naval, indicator, system, which, was, more, complex, than, the, indicator, systems, used, by, the, other, services, that, same, night, he, also, conceived, of, the, idea, of, banburismus, a, sequential, statistical, technique, what, abraham, wald, later, called, sequential, analysis, to, assist, in, breaking, the, naval, enigma, though, i, was, not, sure, that, it, would, work, in, practice, and, was, not, in, fact, sure, until, some, days, had, actually, broken, for, this, he, invented, a, measure, of, weight, of, evidence, that, he, called, the, ban, banburismus, could, rule, out, certain, sequences, of, the, enigma, rotors, substantially, reducing, the, time, needed, to, test, settings, on, the, bombes, later, this, sequential, process, of, accumulating, sufficient, weight, of, evidence, using, decibans, one, tenth, of, a, ban, was, used, in, cryptanalysis, of, the, lorenz, cipher, turing, travelled, to, the, united, states, in, november, 1942, and, worked, with, us, navy, cryptanalysts, on, the, naval, enigma, and, bombe, construction, in, washington, he, also, visited, their, computing, machine, laboratory, in, dayton, ohio, turing, s, reaction, to, the, american, bombe, design, was, far, from, enthusiastic, the, american, bombe, programme, was, to, produce, 336, bombes, one, for, each, wheel, order, i, used, to, smile, inwardly, at, the, conception, of, bombe, hut, routine, implied, by, this, programme, but, thought, that, no, particular, purpose, would, be, served, by, pointing, out, that, we, would, not, really, use, them, in, that, way, their, test, of, commutators, can, hardly, be, considered, conclusive, as, they, were, not, testing, for, the, bounce, with, electronic, stop, finding, devices, nobody, seems, to, be, told, about, rods, or, offiziers, or, banburismus, unless, they, are, really, going, to, do, something, about, it, during, this, trip, he, also, assisted, at, bell, labs, with, the, development, of, secure, speech, devices, he, returned, to, bletchley, park, in, march, 1943, during, his, absence, hugh, alexander, had, officially, assumed, the, position, of, head, of, hut, 8, although, alexander, had, been, de, facto, head, for, some, time, turing, having, little, interest, in, the, day, to, day, running, of, the, section, turing, became, a, general, consultant, for, cryptanalysis, at, bletchley, park, alexander, wrote, of, turing, s, contribution, there, should, be, no, question, in, anyone, s, mind, that, turing, s, work, was, the, biggest, factor, in, hut, 8, s, success, in, the, early, days, he, was, the, only, cryptographer, who, thought, the, problem, worth, tackling, and, not, only, was, he, primarily, responsible, for, the, main, theoretical, work, within, the, hut, but, he, also, shared, with, welchman, and, keen, the, chief, credit, for, the, invention, of, the, bombe, it, is, always, difficult, to, say, that, anyone, is, absolutely, indispensable, but, if, anyone, was, indispensable, to, hut, 8, it, was, turing, the, pioneer, s, work, always, tends, to, be, forgotten, when, experience, and, routine, later, make, everything, seem, easy, and, many, of, us, in, hut, 8, felt, that, the, magnitude, of, turing, s, contribution, was, never, fully, realised, by, the, outside, world, in, july, 1942, turing, devised, a, technique, termed, turingery, or, jokingly, turingismus, for, use, against, the, lorenz, cipher, messages, produced, by, the, germans, new, geheimschreiber, secret, writer, machine, this, was, a, teleprinter, rotor, cipher, attachment, codenamed, tunny, at, bletchley, park, turingery, was, a, method, of, wheel, breaking, i, e, a, procedure, for, working, out, the, cam, settings, of, tunny, s, wheels, he, also, introduced, the, tunny, team, to, tommy, flowers, who, under, the, guidance, of, max, newman, went, on, to, build, the, colossus, computer, the, world, s, first, programmable, digital, electronic, computer, which, replaced, a, simpler, prior, machine, the, heath, robinson, and, whose, superior, speed, allowed, the, statistical, decryption, techniques, to, be, applied, usefully, to, the, messages, some, have, mistakenly, said, that, turing, was, a, key, figure, in, the, design, of, the, colossus, computer, turingery, and, the, statistical, approach, of, banburismus, undoubtedly, fed, into, the, thinking, about, cryptanalysis, of, the, lorenz, cipher, but, he, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, colossus, development, following, his, work, at, bell, labs, in, the, us, turing, pursued, the, idea, of, electronic, enciphering, of, speech, in, the, telephone, system, in, the, latter, part, of, the, war, he, moved, to, work, for, the, secret, service, s, radio, security, service, later, hmgcc, at, hanslope, park, at, the, park, he, further, developed, his, knowledge, of, electronics, with, the, assistance, of, reme, officer, donald, bayley, together, they, undertook, the, design, and, construction, of, a, portable, secure, voice, communications, machine, codenamed, delilah, the, machine, was, intended, for, different, applications, but, it, lacked, the, capability, for, use, with, long, distance, radio, transmissions, in, any, case, delilah, was, completed, too, late, to, be, used, during, the, war, though, the, system, worked, fully, with, turing, demonstrating, it, to, officials, by, encrypting, and, decrypting, a, recording, of, a, winston, churchill, speech, delilah, was, not, adopted, for, use, turing, also, consulted, with, bell, labs, on, the, development, of, sigsaly, a, secure, voice, system, that, was, used, in, the, later, years, of, the, war, between, 1945, and, 1947, turing, lived, in, hampton, london, while, he, worked, on, the, design, of, the, ace, automatic, computing, engine, at, the, national, physical, laboratory, npl, he, presented, a, paper, on, 19, february, 1946, which, was, the, first, detailed, design, of, a, stored, program, computer, von, neumann, s, incomplete, first, draft, of, a, report, on, the, edvac, had, predated, turing, s, paper, but, it, was, much, less, detailed, and, according, to, john, r, womersley, superintendent, of, the, npl, mathematics, division, it, contains, a, number, of, ideas, which, are, dr, turing, s, own, although, ace, was, a, feasible, design, the, effect, of, the, official, secrets, act, surrounding, the, wartime, work, at, bletchley, park, made, it, impossible, for, turing, to, explain, the, basis, of, his, analysis, of, how, a, computer, installation, involving, human, operators, would, work, this, led, to, delays, in, starting, the, project, and, he, became, disillusioned, in, late, 1947, he, returned, to, cambridge, for, a, sabbatical, year, during, which, he, produced, a, seminal, work, on, intelligent, machinery, that, was, not, published, in, his, lifetime, while, he, was, at, cambridge, the, pilot, ace, was, being, built, in, his, absence, it, executed, its, first, program, on, 10, may, 1950, and, a, number, of, later, computers, around, the, world, owe, much, to, it, including, the, english, electric, deuce, and, the, american, bendix, g, 15, the, full, version, of, turing, s, ace, was, not, built, until, after, his, death, according, to, the, memoirs, of, the, german, computer, pioneer, heinz, billing, from, the, max, planck, institute, for, physics, published, by, genscher, d, sseldorf, there, was, a, meeting, between, turing, and, konrad, zuse, it, took, place, in, g, ttingen, in, 1947, the, interrogation, had, the, form, of, a, colloquium, participants, were, womersley, turing, porter, from, england, and, a, few, german, researchers, like, zuse, walther, and, billing, for, more, details, see, herbert, bruderer, konrad, zuse, und, die, schweiz, in, 1948, turing, was, appointed, reader, in, the, mathematics, department, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, a, year, later, he, became, deputy, director, of, the, computing, machine, laboratory, where, he, worked, on, software, for, one, of, the, earliest, stored, program, computers, the, manchester, mark, 1, turing, wrote, the, first, version, of, the, programmer, s, manual, for, this, machine, and, was, recruited, by, ferranti, as, a, consultant, in, the, development, of, their, commercialised, machine, the, ferranti, mark, 1, he, continued, to, be, paid, consultancy, fees, by, ferranti, until, his, death, during, this, time, he, continued, to, do, more, abstract, work, in, mathematics, and, in, computing, machinery, and, intelligence, mind, october, 1950, turing, addressed, the, problem, of, artificial, intelligence, and, proposed, an, experiment, that, became, known, as, the, turing, test, an, attempt, to, define, a, standard, for, a, machine, to, be, called, intelligent, the, idea, was, that, a, computer, could, be, said, to, think, if, a, human, interrogator, could, not, tell, it, apart, through, conversation, from, a, human, being, in, the, paper, turing, suggested, that, rather, than, building, a, program, to, simulate, the, adult, mind, it, would, be, better, to, produce, a, simpler, one, to, simulate, a, child, s, mind, and, then, to, subject, it, to, a, course, of, education, a, reversed, form, of, the, turing, test, is, widely, used, on, the, internet, the, captcha, test, is, intended, to, determine, whether, the, user, is, a, human, or, a, computer, in, 1948, turing, working, with, his, former, undergraduate, colleague, d, g, champernowne, began, writing, a, chess, program, for, a, computer, that, did, not, yet, exist, by, 1950, the, program, was, completed, and, dubbed, the, turochamp, in, 1952, he, tried, to, implement, it, on, a, ferranti, mark, 1, but, lacking, enough, power, the, computer, was, unable, to, execute, the, program, instead, turing, ran, the, program, by, flipping, through, the, pages, of, the, algorithm, and, carrying, out, its, instructions, on, a, chessboard, taking, about, half, an, hour, per, move, the, game, was, recorded, according, to, garry, kasparov, turing, s, program, played, a, recognizable, game, of, chess, the, program, lost, to, turing, s, colleague, alick, glennie, although, it, is, said, that, it, won, a, game, against, champernowne, s, wife, isabel, his, turing, test, was, a, significant, characteristically, provocative, and, lasting, contribution, to, the, debate, regarding, artificial, intelligence, which, continues, after, more, than, half, a, century, when, turing, was, 39, years, old, in, 1951, he, turned, to, mathematical, biology, finally, publishing, his, masterpiece, the, chemical, basis, of, morphogenesis, in, january, 1952, he, was, interested, in, morphogenesis, the, development, of, patterns, and, shapes, in, biological, organisms, he, suggested, that, a, system, of, chemicals, reacting, with, each, other, and, diffusing, across, space, termed, a, reaction, diffusion, system, could, account, for, the, main, phenomena, of, morphogenesis, he, used, systems, of, partial, differential, equations, to, model, catalytic, chemical, reactions, for, example, if, a, catalyst, a, is, required, for, a, certain, chemical, reaction, to, take, place, and, if, the, reaction, produced, more, of, the, catalyst, a, then, we, say, that, the, reaction, is, autocatalytic, and, there, is, positive, feedback, that, can, be, modelled, by, nonlinear, differential, equations, turing, discovered, that, patterns, could, be, created, if, the, chemical, reaction, not, only, produced, catalyst, a, but, also, produced, an, inhibitor, b, that, slowed, down, the, production, of, a, if, a, and, b, then, diffused, through, the, container, at, different, rates, then, you, could, have, some, regions, where, a, dominated, and, some, where, b, did, to, calculate, the, extent, of, this, turing, would, have, needed, a, powerful, computer, but, these, were, not, so, freely, available, in, 1951, so, he, had, to, use, linear, approximations, to, solve, the, equations, by, hand, these, calculations, gave, the, right, qualitative, results, and, produced, for, example, a, uniform, mixture, that, oddly, enough, had, regularly, spaced, fixed, red, spots, the, russian, biochemist, boris, belousov, had, performed, experiments, with, similar, results, but, could, not, get, his, papers, published, because, of, the, contemporary, prejudice, that, any, such, thing, violated, the, second, law, of, thermodynamics, belousov, was, not, aware, of, turing, s, paper, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, although, published, before, the, structure, and, role, of, dna, was, understood, turing, s, work, on, morphogenesis, remains, relevant, today, and, is, considered, a, seminal, piece, of, work, in, mathematical, biology, one, of, the, early, applications, of, turing, s, paper, was, the, work, by, james, murray, explaining, spots, and, stripes, on, the, fur, of, cats, large, and, small, further, research, in, the, area, suggests, that, turing, s, work, can, partially, explain, the, growth, of, feathers, hair, follicles, the, branching, pattern, of, lungs, and, even, the, left, right, asymmetry, that, puts, the, heart, on, the, left, side, of, the, chest, in, 2012, sheth, et, al, found, that, in, mice, removal, of, hox, genes, causes, an, increase, in, the, number, of, digits, without, an, increase, in, the, overall, size, of, the, limb, suggesting, that, hox, genes, control, digit, formation, by, tuning, the, wavelength, of, a, turing, type, mechanism, later, papers, were, not, available, until, collected, works, of, a, m, turing, was, published, in, 1992, a, study, conducted, in, 2023, confirmed, turing, s, mathematical, model, hypothesis, presented, by, the, american, physical, society, the, experiment, involved, growing, chia, seeds, in, even, layers, within, trays, later, adjusting, the, available, moisture, researchers, experimentally, tweaked, the, factors, which, appear, in, the, turing, equations, and, as, a, result, patterns, resembling, those, seen, in, natural, environments, emerged, this, is, believed, to, be, the, first, time, that, experiments, with, living, vegetation, have, verified, turing, s, mathematical, insight, in, the, 1940s, turing, became, worried, about, losing, his, savings, in, the, event, of, a, german, invasion, in, order, to, protect, it, he, bought, two, silver, bars, weighing, 3, 200, oz, 90, kg, and, worth, 250, in, 2022, 8, 000, adjusted, for, inflation, 48, 000, at, spot, price, and, buried, them, in, a, wood, near, bletchley, park, upon, returning, to, dig, them, up, turing, found, that, he, was, unable, to, break, his, own, code, describing, where, exactly, he, had, hidden, them, this, along, with, the, fact, that, the, area, had, been, renovated, meant, that, he, never, regained, the, silver, in, 1941, turing, proposed, marriage, to, hut, 8, colleague, joan, clarke, a, fellow, mathematician, and, cryptanalyst, but, their, engagement, was, short, lived, after, admitting, his, homosexuality, to, his, fianc, e, who, was, reportedly, unfazed, by, the, revelation, turing, decided, that, he, could, not, go, through, with, the, marriage, in, january, 1952, turing, was, 39, when, he, met, arnold, murray, a, 19, year, old, unemployed, man, the, two, agreed, to, meet, again, and, in, 1952, began, an, intimate, relationship, just, before, christmas, turing, was, walking, along, manchester, s, oxford, road, when, he, met, murray, just, outside, the, regal, cinema, and, invited, him, to, lunch, on, 23, january, turing, s, house, was, burgled, murray, told, turing, that, he, and, the, burglar, were, acquainted, and, turing, reported, the, crime, to, the, police, during, the, investigation, he, acknowledged, a, sexual, relationship, with, murray, homosexual, acts, were, criminal, offences, in, the, united, kingdom, at, that, time, and, both, men, were, charged, with, gross, indecency, under, section, 11, of, the, criminal, law, amendment, act, 1885, initial, committal, proceedings, for, the, trial, were, held, on, 27, february, during, which, turing, s, solicitor, reserved, his, defence, i, e, did, not, argue, or, provide, evidence, against, the, allegations, the, proceedings, were, held, at, the, sessions, house, in, knutsford, turing, was, later, convinced, by, the, advice, of, his, brother, and, his, own, solicitor, and, he, entered, a, plea, of, guilty, the, case, regina, v, turing, and, murray, was, brought, to, trial, on, 31, march, 1952, turing, was, convicted, and, given, a, choice, between, imprisonment, and, probation, his, probation, would, be, conditional, on, his, agreement, to, undergo, hormonal, physical, changes, designed, to, reduce, libido, known, as, chemical, castration, he, accepted, the, option, of, injections, of, what, was, then, called, stilboestrol, now, known, as, diethylstilbestrol, or, des, a, synthetic, oestrogen, this, feminization, of, his, body, was, continued, for, the, course, of, one, year, the, treatment, rendered, turing, impotent, and, caused, breast, tissue, to, form, in, a, letter, turing, wrote, that, no, doubt, i, shall, emerge, from, it, all, a, different, man, but, quite, who, i, ve, not, found, out, murray, was, given, a, conditional, discharge, turing, s, conviction, led, to, the, removal, of, his, security, clearance, and, barred, him, from, continuing, with, his, cryptographic, consultancy, for, the, government, communications, headquarters, gchq, the, british, signals, intelligence, agency, that, had, evolved, from, gc, cs, in, 1946, though, he, kept, his, academic, job, his, trial, took, place, only, months, after, the, defection, to, the, soviet, union, of, guy, burgess, and, donald, maclean, in, summer, 1951, after, which, the, foreign, office, started, to, consider, anyone, known, to, be, homosexual, as, a, potential, security, risk, turing, was, denied, entry, into, the, united, states, after, his, conviction, in, 1952, but, was, free, to, visit, other, european, countries, in, the, summer, of, 1952, he, visited, norway, which, was, more, tolerant, of, homosexuals, among, the, various, men, he, met, there, was, one, named, kjell, carlson, kjell, intended, to, visit, turing, in, the, uk, but, the, authorities, intercepted, kjell, s, postcard, detailing, his, travel, arrangements, and, were, able, to, intercept, and, deport, him, before, the, two, could, meet, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, turing, started, consulting, a, psychiatrist, dr, franz, greenbaum, with, whom, he, got, on, well, and, who, subsequently, became, a, family, friend, on, 8, june, 1954, at, his, house, at, 43, adlington, road, wilmslow, turing, s, housekeeper, found, him, dead, a, post, mortem, was, held, that, evening, which, determined, that, he, had, died, the, previous, day, at, age, 41, with, cyanide, poisoning, cited, as, the, cause, of, death, when, his, body, was, discovered, an, apple, lay, half, eaten, beside, his, bed, and, although, the, apple, was, not, tested, for, cyanide, it, was, speculated, that, this, was, the, means, by, which, turing, had, consumed, a, fatal, dose, turing, s, brother, john, identified, the, body, the, following, day, and, took, the, advice, given, by, dr, greenbaum, to, accept, the, verdict, of, the, inquest, as, there, was, little, prospect, of, establishing, that, the, death, was, accidental, the, inquest, was, held, the, following, day, which, determined, the, cause, of, death, to, be, suicide, turing, s, remains, were, cremated, at, woking, crematorium, just, two, days, later, on, 12, june, 1954, with, just, three, people, attending, and, his, ashes, were, scattered, in, the, gardens, of, the, crematorium, just, as, his, father, s, had, been, turing, s, mother, was, on, holiday, in, italy, at, the, time, of, his, death, and, returned, home, after, the, inquest, she, never, accepted, the, verdict, of, suicide, philosopher, jack, copeland, has, questioned, various, aspects, of, the, coroner, s, historical, verdict, he, suggested, an, alternative, explanation, for, the, cause, of, turing, s, death, the, accidental, inhalation, of, cyanide, fumes, from, an, apparatus, used, to, electroplate, gold, onto, spoons, the, potassium, cyanide, was, used, to, dissolve, the, gold, turing, had, such, an, apparatus, set, up, in, his, tiny, spare, room, copeland, noted, that, the, autopsy, findings, were, more, consistent, with, inhalation, than, with, ingestion, of, the, poison, turing, also, habitually, ate, an, apple, before, going, to, bed, and, it, was, not, unusual, for, the, apple, to, be, discarded, half, eaten, furthermore, turing, had, reportedly, borne, his, legal, setbacks, and, hormone, treatment, which, had, been, discontinued, a, year, previously, with, good, humour, and, had, shown, no, sign, of, despondency, before, his, death, he, even, set, down, a, list, of, tasks, that, he, intended, to, complete, upon, returning, to, his, office, after, the, holiday, weekend, turing, s, mother, believed, that, the, ingestion, was, accidental, resulting, from, her, son, s, careless, storage, of, laboratory, chemicals, turing, s, biographer, andrew, hodges, theorised, that, turing, deliberately, left, the, nature, of, his, death, ambiguous, in, order, to, shield, his, mother, from, the, knowledge, that, he, had, killed, himself, doubts, on, the, suicide, thesis, have, been, also, cast, by, john, w, dawson, jr, who, in, his, review, of, hodges, book, recalls, turing, s, vulnerable, position, in, the, cold, war, political, climate, and, points, out, that, turing, was, found, dead, by, a, maid, who, discovered, him, lying, neatly, in, his, bed, hardly, what, one, would, expect, of, a, man, fighting, for, life, against, the, suffocation, induced, by, cyanide, poisoning, turing, had, given, no, hint, of, suicidal, inclinations, to, his, friends, and, had, made, no, effort, to, put, his, affairs, in, order, hodges, and, a, later, biographer, david, leavitt, have, both, speculated, that, turing, was, re, enacting, a, scene, from, the, walt, disney, film, snow, white, and, the, seven, dwarfs, 1937, his, favourite, fairy, tale, both, men, noted, that, in, leavitt, s, words, he, took, an, especially, keen, pleasure, in, the, scene, where, the, wicked, queen, immerses, her, apple, in, the, poisonous, brew, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, turing, s, belief, in, fortune, telling, may, have, caused, his, depressed, mood, as, a, youth, turing, had, been, told, by, a, fortune, teller, that, he, would, be, a, genius, in, mid, may, 1954, shortly, before, his, death, turing, again, decided, to, consult, a, fortune, teller, during, a, day, trip, to, st, annes, on, sea, with, the, greenbaum, family, according, to, the, greenbaums, daughter, barbara, but, it, was, a, lovely, sunny, day, and, alan, was, in, a, cheerful, mood, and, off, we, went, then, he, thought, it, would, be, a, good, idea, to, go, to, the, pleasure, beach, at, blackpool, we, found, a, fortune, teller, s, tent, and, alan, said, he, d, like, to, go, in, so, we, waited, around, for, him, to, come, back, and, this, sunny, cheerful, visage, had, shrunk, into, a, pale, shaking, horror, stricken, face, something, had, happened, we, don, t, know, what, the, fortune, teller, said, but, he, obviously, was, deeply, unhappy, i, think, that, was, probably, the, last, time, we, saw, him, before, we, heard, of, his, suicide, in, august, 2009, british, programmer, john, graham, cumming, started, a, petition, urging, the, british, government, to, apologise, for, turing, s, prosecution, as, a, homosexual, the, petition, received, more, than, 30, 000, signatures, the, prime, minister, gordon, brown, acknowledged, the, petition, releasing, a, statement, on, 10, september, 2009, apologising, and, describing, the, treatment, of, turing, as, appalling, thousands, of, people, have, come, together, to, demand, justice, for, alan, turing, and, recognition, of, the, appalling, way, he, was, treated, while, turing, was, dealt, with, under, the, law, of, the, time, and, we, can, t, put, the, clock, back, his, treatment, was, of, course, utterly, unfair, and, i, am, pleased, to, have, the, chance, to, say, how, deeply, sorry, i, and, we, all, are, for, what, happened, to, him, so, on, behalf, of, the, british, government, and, all, those, who, live, freely, thanks, to, alan, s, work, i, am, very, proud, to, say, we, re, sorry, you, deserved, so, much, better, in, december, 2011, william, jones, and, his, member, of, parliament, john, leech, created, an, e, petition, requesting, that, the, british, government, pardon, turing, for, his, conviction, of, gross, indecency, we, ask, the, hm, government, to, grant, a, pardon, to, alan, turing, for, the, conviction, of, gross, indecency, in, 1952, he, was, convicted, of, gross, indecency, with, another, man, and, was, forced, to, undergo, so, called, organo, therapy, chemical, castration, two, years, later, he, killed, himself, with, cyanide, aged, just, 41, alan, turing, was, driven, to, a, terrible, despair, and, early, death, by, the, nation, he, d, done, so, much, to, save, this, remains, a, shame, on, the, british, government, and, british, history, a, pardon, can, go, some, way, to, healing, this, damage, it, may, act, as, an, apology, to, many, of, the, other, gay, men, not, as, well, known, as, alan, turing, who, were, subjected, to, these, laws, the, petition, gathered, over, 37, 000, signatures, and, was, submitted, to, parliament, by, the, manchester, mp, john, leech, but, the, request, was, discouraged, by, justice, minister, lord, mcnally, who, said, a, posthumous, pardon, was, not, considered, appropriate, as, alan, turing, was, properly, convicted, of, what, at, the, time, was, a, criminal, offence, he, would, have, known, that, his, offence, was, against, the, law, and, that, he, would, be, prosecuted, it, is, tragic, that, alan, turing, was, convicted, of, an, offence, that, now, seems, both, cruel, and, absurd, particularly, poignant, given, his, outstanding, contribution, to, the, war, effort, however, the, law, at, the, time, required, a, prosecution, and, as, such, long, standing, policy, has, been, to, accept, that, such, convictions, took, place, and, rather, than, trying, to, alter, the, historical, context, and, to, put, right, what, cannot, be, put, right, ensure, instead, that, we, never, again, return, to, those, times, john, leech, the, mp, for, manchester, withington, 2005, 15, submitted, several, bills, to, parliament, and, led, a, high, profile, campaign, to, secure, the, pardon, leech, made, the, case, in, the, house, of, commons, that, turing, s, contribution, to, the, war, made, him, a, national, hero, and, that, it, was, ultimately, just, embarrassing, that, the, conviction, still, stood, leech, continued, to, take, the, bill, through, parliament, and, campaigned, for, several, years, gaining, the, public, support, of, numerous, leading, scientists, including, stephen, hawking, at, the, british, premiere, of, a, film, based, on, turing, s, life, the, imitation, game, the, producers, thanked, leech, for, bringing, the, topic, to, public, attention, and, securing, turing, s, pardon, leech, is, now, regularly, described, as, the, architect, of, turing, s, pardon, and, subsequently, the, alan, turing, law, which, went, on, to, secure, pardons, for, 75, 000, other, men, and, women, convicted, of, similar, crimes, on, 26, july, 2012, a, bill, was, introduced, in, the, house, of, lords, to, grant, a, statutory, pardon, to, turing, for, offences, under, section, 11, of, the, criminal, law, amendment, act,

astronomer, royal, lord, rees, president, of, the, royal, society, sir, paul, nurse, lady, trumpington, who, worked, for, turing, during, the, war, and, lord, sharkey, the, bill, s, sponsor, called, on, prime, minister, david, cameron, to, act, on, the, pardon, request, the, government, indicated, it, would, support, the, bill, and, it, passed, its, third, reading, in, the, house, of, lords, in, october, at, the, bill, s, second, reading, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 29, november, 2013, conservative, mp, christopher, chope, objected, to, the, bill, delaying, its, passage, the, bill, was, due, to, return, to, the, house, of, commons, on, 28, february, 2014, but, before, the, bill, could, be, debated, in, the, house, of, commons, the, government, elected, to, proceed, under, the, royal, prerogative, of, mercy, on, 24, december, 2013, queen, elizabeth, ii, signed, a, pardon, for, turing, s, conviction, for, gross, indecency, with, immediate, effect, announcing, the, pardon, lord, chancellor, chris, grayling, said, turing, deserved, to, be, remembered, and, recognised, for, his, fantastic, contribution, to, the, war, effort, and, not, for, his, later, criminal, conviction, the, queen, officially, pronounced, turing, pardoned, in, august, 2014, the, queen, s, action, is, only, the, fourth, royal, pardon, granted, since, the, conclusion, of, the, second, world, war, pardons,

to, turing, s, conviction, in, september, 2016, the, government, announced, its, intention, to, expand, this, retroactive, exoneration, to, other, men, convicted, of, similar, historical, indecency, offences, in, what, was, described, as, an, alan, turing, law, the, alan, turing, law, is, now, an, informal, term, for, the, law, in, the, united, kingdom, contained, in, the, policing, and, crime, act, 2017, which, serves, as, an, amnesty, law, to, retroactively, pardon, men, who, were, cautioned, or, convicted, under, historical, legislation, that, outlawed, homosexual, acts, the, law, applies, in, england, and, wales, on, 19, july, 2023, following, an, apology, to, lgbt, veterans, from, the, uk, government, defence, secretary, ben, wallace, suggested, turing, should, be, honoured, with, a, permanent, statue, on, the, fourth, plinth, of, trafalgar, square, describing, turing, as, probably, the, greatest, war, hero, in, my, book, of, the, second, world, war, achievements, shortened, the, war, saved, thousands, of, lives, helped, defeat, the, nazis, and, his, story, is, a, sad, story, of, a, society, and, how, it, treated, him
