leader, fidel, castro, whose, committees, for, the, defence, of, the, revolution, had, been, created, as, a, form, of, revolutionary, vigilance, a, point, of, contention, regarding, sankara, s, rule, is, the, way, he, handled, the, mossi, ethnic, group, the, mossi, are, the, largest, ethnic, group, in, burkina, faso, and, they, adhere, to, a, strict, traditional, hierarchical, social, systems, at,
