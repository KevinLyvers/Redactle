other, works, see, transactionalism, while, each, of, these, works, focuses, on, one, particular, philosophical, theme, dewey, included, his, major, themes, in, experience, and, nature, however, dissatisfied, with, the, response, to, the, first, 1925, edition, for, the, second, 1929, edition, he, rewrote, the, first, chapter, and, added, a, preface, in, which, he, stated, that, the, book, presented, what, was, later, called, a, new, kuhnian, paradigm, i, have, not, striven, in, this, volume, for, a, reconciliation, between, the, new, and, the, old, and, he, asserts, kuhnian, incommensurability, to, many, the, associating, of, the, two, words, will, seem, like, talking, of, a, round, square, but, i, know, of, no, route, by, which, dialectical, argument, can, answer, such, objections, they, arise, from, association, with, words, and, cannot, be, dealt, with, argumentatively, the, following, can, be, interpreted, now, as, describing, a, kuhnian, conversion, process, one, can, only, hope, in, the, course, of, the, whole, discussion, to, disclose, the, meanings, which, are, attached, to, experience, and, nature, and, thus, insensibly, produce, if, one, is, fortunate, a, change, in, the, significations, previously, attached, to, them, reflecting, his, immense, influence, on, 20th, century, thought, hilda, neatby, wrote, dewey, has, been, to, our, age, what, aristotle, was, to, the, later, middle, ages, not, a, philosopher, but, the, philosopher, in, 1919, dewey, and, his, wife, traveled, to, japan, on, sabbatical, leave, though, dewey, and, his, wife, were, well, received, by, the, people, of, japan, during, this, trip, dewey, was, also, critical, of, the, nation, s, governing, system, and, claimed, that, the, nation, s, path, towards, democracy, was, ambitious, but, weak, in, many, respects, in, which, her, competitors, are, strong, he, also, warned, that, the, real, test, has, not, yet, come, but, if, the, nominally, democratic, world, should, go, back, on, the, professions, so, profusely, uttered, during, war, days, the, shock, will, be, enormous, and, bureaucracy, and, militarism, might, come, back, during, his, trip, to, japan, dewey, was, invited, by, peking, university, to, visit, china, probably, at, the, behest, of, his, former, students, hu, shih, and, chiang, monlin, dewey, and, his, wife, alice, arrived, in, shanghai, on, april, 30, 1919, just, days, before, student, demonstrators, took, to, the, streets, of, peking, to, protest, the, decision, of, the, allies, in, paris, to, cede, the, german, held, territories, in, shandong, province, to, japan, their, demonstrations, on, may, fourth, excited, and, energized, dewey, and, he, ended, up, staying, in, china, for, two, years, leaving, in, july, 1921, in, these, two, years, dewey, gave, nearly, 200, lectures, to, chinese, audiences, and, wrote, nearly, monthly, articles, for, americans, in, the, new, republic, and, other, magazines, well, aware, of, both, japanese, expansionism, into, china, and, the, attraction, of, bolshevism, to, some, chinese, dewey, advocated, that, americans, support, china, s, transformation, and, that, chinese, base, this, transformation, in, education, and, social, reforms, not, revolution, hundreds, and, sometimes, thousands, of, people, attended, the, lectures, which, were, interpreted, by, hu, shih, for, these, audiences, dewey, represented, mr, democracy, and, mr, science, the, two, personifications, which, they, thought, of, representing, modern, values, and, hailed, him, as, the, american, confucius, his, lectures, were, lost, at, the, time, but, have, been, rediscovered, and, published, in, 2015, zhixin, su, states, dewey, urged, the, chinese, to, not, import, any, western, educational, model, he, recommended, to, educators, such, as, tao, xingzhi, that, they, use, pragmatism, to, devise, their, own, model, school, system, at, the, national, level, however, the, national, government, was, weak, and, the, provinces, largely, controlled, by, warlords, so, his, suggestions, were, praised, at, the, national, level, but, not, implemented, however, there, were, a, few, implementations, locally, dewey, s, ideas, did, have, influence, in, hong, kong, and, in, taiwan, after, the, nationalist, government, fled, there, in, most, of, china, confucian, scholars, controlled, the, local, educational, system, before, 1949, and, they, simply, ignored, dewey, and, western, ideas, in, marxist, and, maoist, china, dewey, s, ideas, were, systematically, denounced, dewey, and, his, daughter, jane, went, to, south, africa, in, july, 1934, at, the, invitation, of, the, world, conference, of, new, education, fellowship, in, cape, town, and, johannesburg, where, he, delivered, several, talks, the, conference, was, opened, by, the, south, african, minister, of, education, jan, hofmeyr, and, deputy, prime, minister, jan, smuts, other, speakers, at, the, conference, included, max, eiselen, and, hendrik, verwoerd, who, later, became, prime, minister, of, the, nationalist, government, that, introduced, apartheid, dewey, s, expenses, were, paid, by, the, carnegie, foundation, he, also, traveled, to, durban, pretoria, and, victoria, falls, in, what, was, then, southern, rhodesia, now, zimbabwe, and, looked, at, schools, talked, to, pupils, and, gave, lectures, to, the, administrators, and, teachers, in, august, 1934, dewey, accepted, an, honorary, degree, from, the, university, of, the, witwatersrand, the, white, only, governments, rejected, dewey, s, ideas, as, too, secular, however, black, people, and, their, white, supporters, were, more, receptive, dewey, married, alice, chipman, in, 1886, shortly, after, chipman, graduated, with, her, ph, d, from, the, university, of, michigan, the, two, had, six, children, frederick, archibald, dewey, evelyn, riggs, dewey, morris, who, died, young, gordon, chipman, dewey, lucy, alice, chipman, dewey, and, jane,

mexico, city, in, 1926, she, died, from, cerebral, thrombosis, on, july, 13, 1927, dewey, married, estelle, roberta, lowitz, grant, a, longtime, friend, and, companion, for, several, years, before, their, marriage, on, december, 11, 1946, at, roberta, s, behest, the, couple, adopted, two, siblings, lewis, changed, to, john, jr, and, shirley, dewey, s, interests, and, writings, included, many, topics, and, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, a, substantial, part, of, his, published, output, consisted, of, commentary, on, current, domestic, and, international, politics, and, public, statements, on, behalf, of, many, causes, he, is, probably, the, only, philosopher, in, this, encyclopedia, to, have, published, both, on, the, treaty, of, versailles, and, on, the, value, of, displaying, art, in, post, offices, in, 1917, dewey, met, f, m, alexander, in, new, york, city, and, later, wrote, introductions, to, alexander, s, man, s, supreme, inheritance, 1918, constructive, conscious, control, of, the, individual, 1923, and, the, use, of, the, self, 1932, alexander, s, influence, is, referenced, in, human, nature, and, conduct, and, experience, and, nature, as, well, as, his, contacts, with, people, mentioned, elsewhere, in, the, article, he, also, maintained, correspondence, with, henri, bergson, william, m, brown, martin, buber, george, s, counts, william, rainey, harper, sidney, hook, and, george, santayana, john, dewey, died, of, pneumonia, on, june, 1, 1952, at, his, home, in, new, york, city, after, years, of, ill, health, and, was, cremated, the, next, day, at, the, university, of, michigan, dewey, published, his, first, two, books, psychology, 1887, and, leibniz, s, new, essays, concerning, the, human, understanding, 1888, both, of, which, expressed, dewey, s, early, commitment, to, british, neo, hegelianism, in, psychology, dewey, attempted, a, synthesis, between, idealism, and, experimental, science, while, still, professor, of, philosophy, at, michigan, dewey, and, his, junior, colleagues, james, hayden, tufts, and, george, herbert, mead, together, with, his, student, james, rowland, angell, all, influenced, strongly, by, the, recent, publication, of, william, james, principles, of, psychology, 1890, began, to, reformulate, psychology, emphasizing, the, social, environment, on, the, activity, of, mind, and, behavior, rather, than, the, physiological, psychology, of, wilhelm, wundt, and, his, followers, by, 1894, dewey, had, joined, tufts, with, whom, he, later, wrote, ethics, 1908, at, the, recently, founded, university, of, chicago, and, invited, mead, and, angell, to, follow, him, the, four, men, forming, the, basis, of, the, so, called, chicago, group, of, psychology, their, new, style, of, psychology, later, dubbed, functional, psychology, had, a, practical, emphasis, on, action, and, application, in, dewey, s, article, the, reflex, arc, concept, in, psychology, which, appeared, in, psychological, review, in, 1896, he, reasons, against, the, traditional, stimulus, response, understanding, of, the, reflex, arc, in, favor, of, a, circular, account, in, which, what, serves, as, stimulus, and, what, as, response, depends, on, how, one, considers, the, situation, and, defends, the, unitary, nature, of, the, sensory, motor, circuit, while, he, does, not, deny, the, existence, of, stimulus, sensation, and, response, he, disagreed, that, they, were, separate, juxtaposed, events, happening, like, links, in, a, chain, he, developed, the, idea, that, there, is, a, coordination, by, which, the, stimulation, is, enriched, by, the, results, of, previous, experiences, the, response, is, modulated, by, sensorial, experience, dewey, was, elected, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1899, dewey, also, expressed, interest, in, work, in, the, psychology, of, visual, perception, performed, by, dartmouth, research, professor, adelbert, ames, jr, he, had, great, trouble, with, listening, however, because, it, is, known, dewey, could, not, distinguish, musical, pitches, in, other, words, was, an, amusic, dewey, s, educational, theories, were, presented, in, my, pedagogic, creed, 1897, the, primary, education, fetich, 1898, the, school, and, society, 1900, the, child, and, the, curriculum, 1902, democracy, and, education, 1916, schools, of, to, morrow, archived, may, 6, 2018, at, the, wayback, machine, 1915, with, evelyn, dewey, and, experience, and, education, 1938, several, themes, recur, throughout, these, writings, dewey, continually, argues, that, education, and, learning, are, social, and, interactive, processes, and, thus, the, school, itself, is, a, social, institution, through, which, social, reform, can, and, should, take, place, in, addition, he, believed, that, students, thrive, in, an, environment, where, they, are, allowed, to, experience, and, interact, with, the, curriculum, and, all, students, should, have, the, opportunity, to, take, part, in, their, own, learning, the, ideas, of, democracy, and, social, reform, are, continually, discussed, in, dewey, s, writings, on, education, dewey, makes, a, strong, case, for, the, importance, of, education, not, only, as, a, place, to, gain, content, knowledge, but, also, as, a, place, to, learn, how, to, live, in, his, eyes, the, purpose, of, education, should, not, revolve, around, the, acquisition, of, a, pre, determined, set, of, skills, but, rather, the, realization, of, one, s, full, potential, and, the, ability, to, use, those, skills, for, the, greater, good, he, notes, that, to, prepare, him, for, the, future, life, means, to, give, him, command, of, himself, it, means, so, to, train, him, that, he, will, have, the, full, and, ready, use, of, all, his, capacities, my, pedagogic, creed, dewey, 1897, in, addition, to, helping, students, realize, their, full, potential, dewey, goes, on, to, acknowledge, that, education, and, schooling, are, instrumental, in, creating, social, change, and, reform, he, notes, that, education, is, a, regulation, of, the, process, of, coming, to, share, in, the, social, consciousness, and, that, the, adjustment, of, individual, activity, on, the, basis, of, this, social, consciousness, is, the, only, sure, method, of, social, reconstruction, in, addition, to, his, ideas, regarding, what, education, is, and, what, effect, it, should, have, on, society, dewey, also, had, specific, notions, regarding, how, education, should, take, place, within, the, classroom, in, the, child, and, the, curriculum, 1902, dewey, discusses, two, major, conflicting, schools, of, thought, regarding, educational, pedagogy, the, first, is, centered, on, the, curriculum, and, focuses, almost, solely, on, the, subject, matter, to, be, taught, dewey, argues, that, the, major, flaw, in, this, methodology, is, the, inactivity, of, the, student, within, this, particular, framework, the, child, is, simply, the, immature, being, who, is, to, be, matured, he, is, the, superficial, being, who, is, to, be, deepened, 1902, p, 13, he, argues, that, in, order, for, education, to, be, most, effective, content, must, be, presented, in, a, way, that, allows, the, student, to, relate, the, information, to, prior, experiences, thus, deepening, the, connection, with, this, new, knowledge, at, the, same, time, dewey, was, alarmed, by, many, of, the, child, centered, excesses, of, educational, school, pedagogues, who, claimed, to, be, his, followers, and, he, argued, that, too, much, reliance, on, the, child, could, be, equally, detrimental, to, the, learning, process, in, this, second, school, of, thought, we, must, take, our, stand, with, the, child, and, our, departure, from, him, it, is, he, and, not, the, subject, matter, which, determines, both, quality, and, quantity, of, learning, dewey, 1902, pp, 13, 14, according, to, dewey, the, potential, flaw, in, this, line, of, thinking, is, that, it, minimizes, the, importance, of, the, content, as, well, as, the, role, of, the, teacher, in, order, to, rectify, this, dilemma, dewey, advocated, an, educational, structure, that, strikes, a, balance, between, delivering, knowledge, while, also, taking, into, account, the, interests, and, experiences, of, the, student, he, notes, that, the, child, and, the, curriculum, are, simply, two, limits, which, define, a, single, process, just, as, two, points, define, a, straight, line, so, the, present, standpoint, of, the, child, and, the, facts, and, truths, of, studies, define, instruction, dewey, 1902, p, 16, it, is, through, this, reasoning, that, dewey, became, one, of, the, most, famous, proponents, of, hands, on, learning, or, experiential, education, which, is, related, to, but, not, synonymous, with, experiential, learning, he, argued, that, if, knowledge, comes, from, the, impressions, made, upon, us, by, natural, objects, it, is, impossible, to, procure, knowledge, without, the, use, of, objects, which, impress, the, mind, dewey, 1916, 2009, pp, 217, 18, dewey, s, ideas, went, on, to, influence, many, other, influential, experiential, models, and, advocates, problem, based, learning, pbl, for, example, a, method, used, widely, in, education, today, incorporates, dewey, s, ideas, pertaining, to, learning, through, active, inquiry, dewey, not, only, re, imagined, the, way, that, the, learning, process, should, take, place, but, also, the, role, that, the, teacher, should, play, within, that, process, throughout, the, history, of, american, schooling, education, s, purpose, has, been, to, train, students, for, work, by, providing, the, student, with, a, limited, set, of, skills, and, information, to, do, a, particular, job, the, works, of, john, dewey, provide, the, most, prolific, examples, of, how, this, limited, vocational, view, of, education, has, been, applied, to, both, the, k, 12, public, education, system, and, to, the, teacher, training, schools, that, attempted, to, quickly, produce, proficient, and, practical, teachers, with, a, limited, set, of, instructional, and, discipline, specific, skills, needed, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, employer, and, demands, of, the, workforce, in, the, school, and, society, dewey, 1899, and, democracy, of, education, dewey, 1916, dewey, claims, that, rather, than, preparing, citizens, for, ethical, participation, in, society, schools, cultivate, passive, pupils, via, insistence, upon, mastery, of, facts, and, disciplining, of, bodies, rather, than, preparing, students, to, be, reflective, autonomous, and, ethical, beings, capable, of, arriving, at, social, truths, through, critical, and, intersubjective, discourse, schools, prepare, students, for, docile, compliance, with, authoritarian, work, and, political, structures, discourage, the, pursuit, of, individual, and, communal, inquiry, and, perceive, higher, learning, as, a, monopoly, of, the, institution, of, education, dewey, 1899, 1916, for, dewey, and, his, philosophical, followers, education, stifles, individual, autonomy, when, learners, are, taught, that, knowledge, is, transmitted, in, one, direction, from, the, expert, to, the, learner, dewey, not, only, re, imagined, the, way, that, the, learning, process, should, take, place, but, also, the, role, that, the, teacher, should, play, within, that, process, for, dewey, the, thing, needful, is, improvement, of, education, not, simply, by, turning, out, teachers, who, can, do, better, the, things, that, are, not, necessary, to, do, but, rather, by, changing, the, conception, of, what, constitutes, education, dewey, 1904, p, 18, dewey, s, qualifications, for, teaching, a, natural, love, for, working, with, young, children, a, natural, propensity, to, inquire, about, the, subjects, methods, and, other, social, issues, related, to, the, profession, and, a, desire, to, share, this, acquired, knowledge, with, others, are, not, a, set, of, outwardly, displayed, mechanical, skills, rather, they, may, be, viewed, as, internalized, principles, or, habits, which, work, automatically, unconsciously, dewey, 1904, p, 15, turning, to, dewey, s, essays, and, public, addresses, regarding, the, teaching, profession, followed, by, his, analysis, of, the, teacher, as, a, person, and, a, professional, as, well, as, his, beliefs, regarding, the, responsibilities, of, teacher, education, programs, to, cultivate, the, attributes, addressed, teacher, educators, can, begin, to, reimagine, the, successful, classroom, teacher, dewey, envisioned, for, many, education, s, purpose, is, to, train, students, for, work, by, providing, the, student, with, a, limited, set, of, skills, and, information, to, do, a, particular, job, as, dewey, notes, this, limited, vocational, view, is, also, applied, to, teacher, training, schools, who, attempt, to, quickly, produce, proficient, and, practical, teachers, with, a, limited, set, of, instructional, and, discipline, skills, needed, to, meet, the, needs, of, the, employer, and, demands, of, the, workforce, dewey, 1904, for, dewey, the, school, and, the, classroom, teacher, as, a, workforce, and, provider, of, social, service, have, a, unique, responsibility, to, produce, psychological, and, social, goods, that, will, lead, to, both, present, and, future, social, progress, as, dewey, notes, the, business, of, the, teacher, is, to, produce, a, higher, standard, of, intelligence, in, the, community, and, the, object, of, the, public, school, system, is, to, make, as, large, as, possible, the, number, of, those, who, possess, this, intelligence, skill, the, ability, to, act, wisely, and, effectively, in, a, great, variety, of, occupations, and, situations, is, a, sign, and, a, criterion, of, the, degree, of, civilization, that, a, society, has, reached, it, is, the, business, of, teachers, to, help, in, producing, the, many, kinds, of, skills, needed, in, contemporary, life, if, teachers, are, up, to, their, work, they, also, aid, in, the, production, of, character, dewey, tap, 2010, pp, 241, 42, according, to, dewey, the, emphasis, is, placed, on, producing, these, attributes, in, children, for, use, in, their, contemporary, life, because, it, is, impossible, to, foretell, definitely, just, what, civilization, will, be, twenty, years, from, now, dewey, mpc, 2010, p, 25, however, although, dewey, is, steadfast, in, his, beliefs, that, education, serves, an, immediate, purpose, dewey, drt, 2010, dewey, mpc, 2010, dewey, ttp, 2010, he, is, not, ignorant, of, the, impact, imparting, these, qualities, of, intelligence, skill, and, character, on, young, children, in, their, present, life, will, have, on, the, future, society, while, addressing, the, state, of, educative, and, economic, affairs, during, a, 1935, radio, broadcast, dewey, linked, the, ensuing, economic, depression, to, a, lack, of, sufficient, production, of, intelligence, skill, and, character, dewey, tap, 2010, p, 242, of, the, nation, s, workforce, as, dewey, notes, there, is, a, lack, of, these, goods, in, the, present, society, and, teachers, have, a, responsibility, to, create, them, in, their, students, who, we, can, assume, will, grow, into, the, adults, who, will, ultimately, go, on, to, participate, in, whatever, industrial, or, economic, civilization, awaits, them, according, to, dewey, the, profession, of, the, classroom, teacher, is, to, produce, the, intelligence, skill, and, character, within, each, student, so, that, the, democratic, community, is, composed, of, citizens, who, can, think, do, and, act, intelligently, and, morally, dewey, believed, that, successful, classroom, teacher, possesses, a, passion, for, knowledge, and, intellectual, curiosity, in, the, materials, and, methods, they, teach, for, dewey, this, propensity, is, an, inherent, curiosity, and, love, for, learning, that, differs, from, one, s, ability, to, acquire, recite, and, reproduce, textbook, knowledge, no, one, according, to, dewey, can, be, really, successful, in, performing, the, duties, and, meeting, these, demands, who, does, not, retain, intellectual, curiosity, intact, throughout, entire, career, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 34, according, to, dewey, it, is, not, that, the, teacher, ought, to, strive, to, be, a, high, class, scholar, in, all, the, subjects, he, or, she, has, to, teach, rather, a, teacher, ought, to, have, an, unusual, love, and, aptitude, in, some, one, subject, history, mathematics, literature, science, a, fine, art, or, whatever, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 35, the, classroom, teacher, does, not, have, to, be, a, scholar, in, all, subjects, rather, genuine, love, in, one, will, elicit, a, feel, for, genuine, information, and, insight, in, all, subjects, taught, in, addition, to, this, propensity, for, study, into, the, subjects, taught, the, classroom, teacher, is, possessed, by, a, recognition, of, the, responsibility, for, the, constant, study, of, school, room, work, the, constant, study, of, children, of, methods, of, subject, matter, in, its, various, adaptations, to, pupils, dewey, pst, 2010, p, 37, for, dewey, this, desire, for, the, lifelong, pursuit, of, learning, is, inherent, in, other, professions, e, g, the, architectural, legal, and, medical, fields, dewey, 1904, dewey, pst, 2010, and, has, particular, importance, for, the, field, of, teaching, as, dewey, notes, this, further, study, is, not, a, sideline, but, something, which, fits, directly, into, the, demands, and, opportunities, of, the, vocation, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 34, according, to, dewey, this, propensity, and, passion, for, intellectual, growth, in, the, profession, must, be, accompanied, by, a, natural, desire, to, communicate, one, s, knowledge, with, others, there, are, scholars, who, have, in, a, marked, degree, but, who, lack, enthusiasm, for, imparting, it, to, the, natural, born, teacher, learning, is, incomplete, unless, it, is, shared, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 35, for, dewey, it, is, not, enough, for, the, classroom, teacher, to, be, a, lifelong, learner, of, the, techniques, and, subject, matter, of, education, she, must, aspire, to, share, what, she, knows, with, others, in, her, learning, community, the, best, indicator, of, teacher, quality, according, to, dewey, is, the, ability, to, watch, and, respond, to, the, movement, of, the, mind, with, keen, awareness, of, the, signs, and, quality, of, the, responses, his, or, her, students, exhibit, with, regard, to, the, subject, matter, presented, dewey, apt, 2010, dewey, 1904, as, dewey, notes, i, have, often, been, asked, how, it, was, that, some, teachers, who, have, never, studied, the, art, of, teaching, are, still, extraordinarily, good, teachers, the, explanation, is, simple, they, have, a, quick, sure, and, unflagging, sympathy, with, the, operations, and, process, of, the, minds, they, are, in, contact, with, their, own, minds, move, in, harmony, with, those, of, others, appreciating, their, difficulties, entering, into, their, problems, sharing, their, intellectual, victories, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 36, such, a, teacher, is, genuinely, aware, of, the, complexities, of, this, mind, to, mind, transfer, and, she, has, the, intellectual, fortitude, to, identify, the, successes, and, failures, of, this, process, as, well, as, how, to, appropriately, reproduce, or, correct, it, in, the, future, as, a, result, of, the, direct, influence, teachers, have, in, shaping, the, mental, moral, and, spiritual, lives, of, children, during, their, most, formative, years, dewey, holds, the, profession, of, teaching, in, high, esteem, often, equating, its, social, value, to, that, of, the, ministry, and, to, parenting, dewey, apt, 2010, dewey, drt, 2010, dewey, mpc, 2010, dewey, pst, 2010, dewey, ttc, 2010, dewey, ttp, 2010, perhaps, the, most, important, attributes, according, to, dewey, are, those, personal, inherent, qualities, that, the, teacher, brings, to, the, classroom, as, dewey, notes, no, amount, of, learning, or, even, of, acquired, pedagogical, skill, makes, up, for, the, deficiency, dewey, tls, p, 25, of, the, personal, traits, needed, to, be, most, successful, in, the, profession, according, to, dewey, the, successful, classroom, teacher, occupies, an, indispensable, passion, for, promoting, the, intellectual, growth, of, young, children, in, addition, they, know, that, their, career, in, comparison, to, other, professions, entails, stressful, situations, long, hours, and, limited, financial, reward, all, of, which, have, the, potential, to, overcome, their, genuine, love, and, sympathy, for, their, students, for, dewey, one, of, the, most, depressing, phases, of, the, vocation, is, the, number, of, careworn, teachers, one, sees, with, anxiety, depicted, on, the, lines, of, their, faces, reflected, in, their, strained, high, pitched, voices, and, sharp, manners, while, contact, with, the, young, is, a, privilege, for, some, temperaments, it, is, a, tax, on, others, and, a, tax, which, they, do, not, bear, up, under, very, well, and, in, some, schools, there, are, too, many, pupils, to, a, teacher, too, many, subjects, to, teach, and, adjustments, to, pupils, are, made, in, a, mechanical, rather, than, a, human, way, human, nature, reacts, against, such, unnatural, conditions, dewey, apt, 2010, p, 35, it, is, essential, according, to, dewey, that, the, classroom, teacher, has, the, mental, propensity, to, overcome, the, demands, and, stressors, placed, on, them, because, the, students, can, sense, when, their, teacher, is, not, genuinely, invested, in, promoting, their, learning, dewey, pst, 2010, such, negative, demeanors, according, to, dewey, prevent, children, from, pursuing, their, own, propensities, for, learning, and, intellectual, growth, it, can, therefore, be, assumed, that, if, teachers, want, their, students, to, engage, with, the, educational, process, and, employ, their, natural, curiosities, for, knowledge, teachers, must, be, aware, of, how, their, reactions, to, young, children, and, the, stresses, of, teaching, influence, this, process, dewey, s, passions, for, teaching, a, natural, love, for, working, with, young, children, a, natural, propensity, to, inquire, about, the, subjects, methods, and, other, social, issues, related, to, the, profession, and, a, desire, to, share, this, acquired, knowledge, with, others, are, not, a, set, of, outwardly, displayed, mechanical, skills, rather, they, may, be, viewed, as, internalized, principles, or, habits, which, work, automatically, unconsciously, dewey, 1904, p, 15, according, to, dewey, teacher, education, programs, must, turn, away, from, focusing, on, producing, proficient, practitioners, because, such, practical, skills, related, to, instruction, and, discipline, e, g, creating, and, delivering, lesson, plans, classroom, management, implementation, of, an, assortment, of, content, specific, methods, can, be, learned, over, time, during, their, everyday, schoolwork, with, their, students, dewey, pst, 2010, as, dewey, notes, the, teacher, who, leaves, the, professional, school, with, power, in, managing, a, class, of, children, may, appear, to, superior, advantage, the, first, day, the, first, week, the, first, month, or, even, the, first, year, as, compared, with, some, other, teacher, who, has, a, much, more, vital, command, of, the, psychology, logic, and, ethics, of, development, but, later, progress, may, consist, only, in, perfecting, and, refining, skill, already, possessed, such, persons, seem, to, know, how, to, teach, but, they, are, not, students, of, teaching, even, though, they, go, on, studying, books, of, pedagogy, reading, teachers, journals, attending, teachers, institutes, etc, yet, the, root, of, the, matter, is, not, in, them, unless, they, continue, to, be, students, of, subject, matter, and, students, of, mind, activity, unless, a, teacher, is, such, a, student, he, may, continue, to, improve, in, the, mechanics, of, school, management, but, he, cannot, grow, as, a, teacher, an, inspirer, and, director, of, soul, life, dewey, 1904, p, 15, for, dewey, teacher, education, should, focus, not, on, producing, persons, who, know, how, to, teach, as, soon, as, they, leave, the, program, rather, teacher, education, should, be, concerned, with, producing, professional, students, of, education, who, have, the, propensity, to, inquire, about, the, subjects, they, teach, the, methods, used, and, the, activity, of, the, mind, as, it, gives, and, receives, knowledge, according, to, dewey, such, a, student, is, not, superficially, engaging, with, these, materials, rather, the, professional, student, of, education, has, a, genuine, passion, to, inquire, about, the, subjects, of, education, knowing, that, doing, so, ultimately, leads, to, acquisitions, of, the, skills, related, to, teaching, such, students, of, education, aspire, for, the, intellectual, growth, within, the, profession, that, can, only, be, achieved, by, immersing, oneself, in, the, lifelong, pursuit, of, the, intelligence, skills, and, character, dewey, linked, to, the, profession, as, dewey, notes, other, professional, fields, such, as, law, and, medicine, cultivate, a, professional, spirit, in, their, fields, to, constantly, study, their, work, their, methods, of, their, work, and, a, perpetual, need, for, intellectual, growth, and, concern, for, issues, related, to, their, profession, teacher, education, as, a, profession, has, these, same, obligations, dewey, 1904, dewey, pst, 2010, as, dewey, notes, an, intellectual, responsibility, has, got, to, be, distributed, to, every, human, being, who, is, concerned, in, carrying, out, the, work, in, question, and, to, attempt, to, concentrate, intellectual, responsibility, for, a, work, that, has, to, be, done, with, their, brains, and, their, hearts, by, hundreds, or, thousands, of, people, in, a, dozen, or, so, at, the, top, no, matter, how, wise, and, skillful, they, are, is, not, to, concentrate, responsibility, it, is, to, diffuse, irresponsibility, dewey, pst, 2010, p, 39, for, dewey, the, professional, spirit, of, teacher, education, requires, of, its, students, a, constant, study, of, school, room, work, constant, study, of, children, of, methods, of, subject, matter, in, its, various, adaptations, to, pupils, such, study, will, lead, to, professional, enlightenment, with, regard, to, the, daily, operations, of, classroom, teaching, as, well, as, his, very, active, and, direct, involvement, in, setting, up, educational, institutions, such, as, the, university, of, chicago, laboratory, schools, 1896, and, the, new, school, for, social, research, 1919, many, of, dewey, s, ideas, influenced, the, founding, of, bennington, college, and, goddard, college, in, vermont, where, he, served, on, the, board, of, trustees, dewey, s, works, and, philosophy, also, held, great, influence, in, the, creation, of, the, short, lived, black, mountain, college, in, north, carolina, an, experimental, college, focused, on, interdisciplinary, study, and, whose, faculty, included, buckminster, fuller, willem, de, kooning, charles, olson, franz, kline, robert, duncan, robert, creeley, and, paul, goodman, among, others, black, mountain, college, was, the, locus, of, the, black, mountain, poets, a, group, of, avant, garde, poets, closely, linked, with, the, beat, generation, and, the, san, francisco, renaissance, dewey, s, definition, of, public, as, described, in, the, public, and, its, problems, has, profound, implications, for, the, significance, of, journalism, in, society, as, suggested, by, the, title, of, the, book, his, concern, was, of, the, transactional, relationship, between, publics, and, problems, also, implicit, in, its, name, public, journalism, seeks, to, orient, communication, away, from, elite, corporate, hegemony, toward, a, civic, public, sphere, the, public, of, public, journalists, is, dewey, s, public, dewey, gives, a, concrete, definition, to, the, formation, of, a, public, publics, are, spontaneous, groups, of, citizens, who, share, the, indirect, effects, of, a, particular, action, anyone, affected, by, the, indirect, consequences, of, a, specific, action, will, automatically, share, a, common, interest, in, controlling, those, consequences, i, e, solving, a, common, problem, since, every, action, generates, unintended, consequences, publics, continuously, emerge, overlap, and, disintegrate, in, the, public, and, its, problems, dewey, presents, a, rebuttal, to, walter, lippmann, s, treatise, on, the, role, of, journalism, in, democracy, lippmann, s, model, was, a, basic, transmission, model, in, which, journalists, took, information, given, to, them, by, experts, and, elites, repackaged, that, information, in, simple, terms, and, transmitted, the, information, to, the, public, whose, role, was, to, react, emotionally, to, the, news, in, his, model, lippmann, supposed, that, the, public, was, incapable, of, thought, or, action, and, that, all, thought, and, action, should, be, left, to, the, experts, and, elites, dewey, refutes, this, model, by, assuming, that, politics, is, the, work, and, duty, of, each, individual, in, the, course, of, his, daily, routine, the, knowledge, needed, to, be, involved, in, politics, in, this, model, was, to, be, generated, by, the, interaction, of, citizens, elites, experts, through, the, mediation, and, facilitation, of, journalism, in, this, model, not, just, the, government, is, accountable, but, the, citizens, experts, and, other, actors, as, well, dewey, also, said, that, journalism, should, conform, to, this, ideal, by, changing, its, emphasis, from, actions, or, happenings, choosing, a, winner, of, a, given, situation, to, alternatives, choices, consequences, and, conditions, in, order, to, foster, conversation, and, improve, the, generation, of, knowledge, journalism, would, not, just, produce, a, static, product, that, told, what, had, already, happened, but, the, news, would, be, in, a, constant, state, of, evolution, as, the, public, added, value, by, generating, knowledge, the, audience, would, end, to, be, replaced, by, citizens, and, collaborators, who, would, essentially, be, users, doing, more, with, the, news, than, simply, reading, it, concerning, his, effort, to, change, journalism, he, wrote, in, the, public, and, its, problems, till, the, great, society, is, converted, in, to, a, great, community, the, public, will, remain, in, eclipse, communication, can, alone, create, a, great, community, dewey, p, 142, dewey, believed, that, communication, creates, a, great, community, and, citizens, who, participate, actively, with, public, life, contribute, to, that, community, the, clear, consciousness, of, a, communal, life, in, all, its, implications, constitutes, the, idea, of, democracy, the, public, and, its, problems, p, 149, this, great, community, can, only, occur, with, free, and, full, intercommunication, p, 211, communication, can, be, understood, as, journalism, dewey, sees, paradox, in, contemporary, logical, theory, proximate, subject, matter, garners, general, agreement, and, advancement, while, the, ultimate, subject, matter, of, logic, generates, unremitting, controversy, in, other, words, he, challenges, confident, logicians, to, answer, the, question, of, the, truth, of, logical, operators, do, they, function, merely, as, abstractions, e, g, pure, mathematics, or, do, they, connect, in, some, essential, way, with, their, objects, and, therefore, alter, or, bring, them, to, light, logical, positivism, also, figured, in, dewey, s, thought, about, the, movement, he, wrote, that, it, eschews, the, use, of, propositions, and, terms, substituting, sentences, and, words, general, theory, of, propositions, in, logic, the, theory, of, inquiry, he, welcomes, this, changing, of, referents, in, as, far, as, it, fixes, attention, upon, the, symbolic, structure, and, content, of, propositions, however, he, registers, a, small, complaint, against, the, use, of, sentence, and, words, in, that, without, careful, interpretation, the, act, or, process, of, transposition, narrows, unduly, the, scope, of, symbols, and, language, since, it, is, not, customary, to, treat, gestures, and, diagrams, maps, blueprints, etc, as, words, or, sentences, in, other, words, sentences, and, words, considered, in, isolation, do, not, disclose, intent, which, may, be, inferred, or, adjudged, only, by, means, of, context, yet, dewey, was, not, entirely, opposed, to, modern, logical, trends, indeed, the, deficiencies, in, traditional, logic, he, expressed, hope, for, the, trends, to, solve, occupies, the, whole, first, part, of, same, book, concerning, traditional, logic, he, states, there, aristotelian, logic, which, still, passes, current, nominally, is, a, logic, based, upon, the, idea, that, qualitative, objects, are, existential, in, the, fullest, sense, to, retain, logical, principles, based, on, this, conception, along, with, the, acceptance, of, theories, of, existence, and, knowledge, based, on, an, opposite, conception, is, not, to, say, the, least, conductive, to, clearness, a, consideration, that, has, a, good, deal, to, do, with, existing, dualism, between, traditional, and, the, newer, relational, logics, louis, menand, argues, in, the, metaphysical, club, that, jane, addams, had, been, critical, of, dewey, s, emphasis, on, antagonism, in, the, context, of, a, discussion, of, the, pullman, strike, of, 1894, in, a, later, letter, to, his, wife, dewey, confessed, that, addams, argument, was, the, most, magnificent, exhibition, of, intellectual, moral, faith, i, ever, saw, she, converted, me, internally, but, not, really, i, fear, when, you, think, that, miss, addams, does, not, think, this, as, a, philosophy, but, believes, it, in, all, her, senses, muscles, great, god, he, added, i, can, see, that, i, have, always, been, interpreting, the, dialectic, wrong, end, up, the, unity, as, the, reconciliation, of, opposites, instead, of, the, opposites, as, the, unity, in, its, growth, and, thus, translated, the, physical, tension, into, a, moral, thing, i, don, t, know, as, i, give, the, reality, of, this, at, all, it, seems, so, natural, commonplace, now, but, i, never, had, anything, take, hold, of, me, so, in, a, letter, to, addams, clearly, influenced, by, his, conversation, with, her, dewey, wrote, not, only, is, actual, antagonizing, bad, but, the, assumption, that, there, is, or, may, be, antagonism, is, bad, art, as, experience, 1934, is, dewey, s, major, writing, on, aesthetics, it, is, in, accordance, with, his, place, in, the, pragmatist, tradition, that, emphasizes, community, a, study, of, the, individual, art, object, as, embedded, in, and, inextricable, from, the, experiences, of, a, local, culture, in, the, original, illustrated, edition, dewey, drew, on, the, modern, art, and, world, cultures, collection, assembled, by, albert, c, barnes, at, the, barnes, foundation, whose, own, ideas, on, the, application, of, art, to, one, s, way, of, life, was, influenced, by, dewey, s, writing, dewey, made, art, through, writing, poetry, but, he, considered, himself, deeply, unmusical, one, of, his, students, described, dewey, as, allergic, to, music, barnes, was, particularly, influenced, by, democracy, and, education, 1916, and, then, attended, dewey, s, seminar, on, political, philosophy, at, columbia, university, in, the, fall, semester, of, 1918, dewey, founded, the, university, of, chicago, laboratory, school, supported, educational, organizations, and, supported, settlement, houses, especially, jane, addams, hull, house, john, dewey, and, jane, addams, influenced, each, other, s, expansive, theory, of, democracy, through, his, work, at, the, hull, house, serving, on, its, first, board, of, trustees, dewey, was, not, only, an, activist, for, the, cause, but, also, a, partner, working, to, serve, the, large, immigrant, community, of, chicago, and, women, s, suffrage, dewey, experienced, the, lack, of, children, s, education, while, contributing, in, the, classroom, at, the, hull, house, there, he, also, experienced, the, lack, of, education, and, skills, of, immigrant, women, stengel, argues, addams, is, unquestionably, a, maker, of, democratic, community, and, pragmatic, education, dewey, is, just, as, unquestionably, a, reflector, through, her, work, at, hull, house, addams, discerned, the, shape, of, democracy, as, a, mode, of, associated, living, and, uncovered, the, outlines, of, an, experimental, approach, to, knowledge, and, understanding, dewey, analyzed, and, classified, the, social, psychological, and, educational, processes, addams, lived, his, leading, views, on, democracy, included, first, dewey, believed, that, democracy, is, an, ethical, ideal, rather, than, merely, a, political, arrangement, second, he, considered, participation, not, representation, the, essence, of, democracy, third, he, insisted, on, the, harmony, between, democracy, and, the, scientific, method, ever, expanding, and, self, critical, communities, of, inquiry, operating, on, pragmatic, principles, and, constantly, revising, their, beliefs, in, light, of, new, evidence, provided, dewey, with, a, model, for, democratic, decision, making, finally, dewey, called, for, extending, democracy, conceived, as, an, ethical, project, from, politics, to, industry, and, society, this, helped, to, shape, his, understanding, of, human, action, and, the, unity, of, human, experience, dewey, believed, that, a, woman, s, place, in, society, was, determined, by, her, environment, and, not, just, her, biology, on, women, he, says, you, think, too, much, of, women, in, terms, of, sex, think, of, them, as, human, individuals, for, a, while, dropping, out, the, sex, qualification, and, you, won, t, be, so, sure, of, some, of, your, generalizations, about, what, they, should, and, shouldn, t, do, john, dewey, s, support, helped, to, increase, the, support, and, popularity, of, jane, addams, hull, house, and, other, settlement, houses, as, well, with, growing, support, involvement, of, the, community, grew, as, well, as, the, support, for, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, as, commonly, argued, by, dewey, s, greatest, critics, he, was, not, able, to, come, up, with, strategies, in, order, to, fulfill, his, ideas, that, would, lead, to, a, successful, democracy, educational, system, and, a, successful, women, s, suffrage, movement, while, knowing, that, traditional, beliefs, customs, and, practices, needed, to, be, examined, in, order, to, find, out, what, worked, and, what, needed, improved, upon, it, was, never, done, in, a, systematic, way, dewey, became, increasingly, aware, of, the, obstacles, presented, by, entrenched, power, and, alert, to, the, intricacy, of, the, problems, facing, modern, cultures, with, the, complex, of, society, at, the, time, dewey, was, criticized, for, his, lack, of, effort, in, fixing, the, problems, with, respect, to, technological, developments, in, a, democracy, persons, do, not, become, a, society, by, living, in, physical, proximity, any, more, than, a, man, ceases, to, be, socially, influenced, by, being, so, many, feet, or, miles, removed, from, others, his, work, on, democracy, influenced, b, r, ambedkar, one, of, his, students, who, later, served, as, a, law, and, justice, minister, of, india, historians, have, examined, his, religious, beliefs, biographer, steven, clark, rockefeller, traced, dewey, s, democratic, convictions, to, his, childhood, attendance, at, the, congregational, church, with, its, strong, proclamation, of, social, ideals, and, the, social, gospel, historian, edward, a, white, suggested, in, science, and, religion, in, american, thought, 1952, that, dewey, s, work, led, to, the, 20th, century, rift, between, religion, and, science, dewey, went, through, an, evangelical, development, as, a, child, as, an, adult, he, was, negative, or, at, most, neutral, about, theology, in, education, he, instead, took, a, meliorist, position, with, the, goal, of, scientific, humanism, and, educational, and, social, reform, without, recourse, to, religion, as, an, atheist, and, a, secular, humanist, in, his, later, life, dewey, participated, with, a, variety, of, humanistic, activities, from, the, 1930s, into, the, 1950s, which, included, sitting, on, the, advisory, board, of, charles, francis, potter, s, first, humanist, society, of, new, york, 1929, being, one, of, the, original, 34, signatories, of, the, first, humanist, manifesto, 1933, and, being, elected, an, honorary, member, of, the, humanist, press, association, 1936, his, opinion, of, humanism, is, summarized, in, his, own, words, from, an, article, titled, what, humanism, means, to, me, published, in, the, june, 1930, edition, of, thinker, 2, what, humanism, means, to, me, is, an, expansion, not, a, contraction, of, human, life, an, expansion, in, which, nature, and, the, science, of, nature, are, made, the, willing, servants, of, human, good, dewey, sometimes, referred, to, his, philosophy, as, instrumentalism, rather, than, pragmatism, and, would, have, recognized, the, similarity, of, these, two, schools, to, the, newer, school, named, consequentialism, in, some, phrases, introducing, a, book, he, wrote, later, in, life, meant, to, help, forestay, a, wandering, kind, of, criticism, of, the, work, based, on, the, controversies, due, to, the, differences, in, the, schools, that, he, sometimes, invoked, he, defined, at, the, same, time, with, precise, brevity, the, criterion, of, validity, common, to, these, three, schools, which, lack, agreed, upon, definitions, but, in, the, proper, interpretation, of, pragmatic, namely, the, function, of, consequences, as, necessary, tests, of, the, validity, of, propositions, provided, these, consequences, are, operationally, instituted, and, are, such, as, to, resolve, the, specific, problem, evoking, the, operations, the, text, that, follows, is, thoroughly, pragmatic, his, concern, for, precise, definition, led, him, to, detailed, analysis, of, careless, word, usage, reported, in, knowing, and, the, known, in, 1949, dewey, also, regularly, refers, and, discusses, the, definitions, of, pragmatism, used, by, other, philosophers, within, the, movement, such, as, charles, pierce, and, william, james, when, trying, to, pin, down, his, own, definitions, in, his, essays, in, experimental, logic, regarding, pierce, he, writes, mr, pierce, explained, that, he, took, the, term, pragmatic, from, kant, in, order, to, denote, empirical, consequences, following, this, statement, he, also, introduces, james, usage, of, the, term, pragmatism, when, he, writes, what, is, important, is, that, the, consequences, should, be, specific, when, he, said, that, general, notions, must, cash, in, he, meant, of, course, that, they, must, be, translatable, into, verifiable, specific, things, the, terminology, problem, in, the, fields, of, epistemology, and, logic, is, partially, due, according, to, dewey, and, bentley, to, inefficient, and, imprecise, use, of, words, and, concepts, that, reflect, three, historic, levels, of, organization, and, presentation, in, the, order, of, chronological, appearance, these, are, a, series, of, characterizations, of, transactions, indicate, the, wide, range, of, considerations, involved, while, dewey, was, at, the, university, of, chicago, his, letters, to, his, wife, alice, and, his, colleague, jane, addams, reveal, that, he, closely, followed, the, 1894, pullman, strike, in, which, the, employees, of, the, pullman, palace, car, factory, in, chicago, decided, to, go, on, strike, after, industrialist, george, pullman, refused, to, lower, rents, in, his, company, town, after, cutting, his, workers, wages, by, nearly, 30, percent, on, may, 11, 1894, the, strike, became, official, later, gaining, the, support, of, the, members, of, the, american, railway, union, whose, leader, eugene, v, debs, called, for, a, nationwide, boycott, of, all, trains, including, pullman, sleeping, cars, considering, most, trains, had, pullman, cars, the, main, 24, lines, out, of, chicago, were, halted, and, the, mail, was, stopped, as, the, workers, destroyed, trains, all, over, the, united, states, president, grover, cleveland, used, the, mail, as, a, justification, to, send, in, the, national, guard, and, aru, leader, eugene, debs, was, arrested, dewey, wrote, to, alice, the, only, wonder, is, that, when, the, higher, classes, damn, them, take, such, views, there, aren, t, more, downright, socialists, hat, a, representative, journal, of, the, upper, classes, damn, them, again, can, take, the, attitude, of, that, harper, s, weekly, referring, to, headlines, such, as, monopoly, and, repress, the, rebellion, which, claimed, in, dewey, s, words, to, support, the, sensational, belief, that, debs, was, a, criminal, inspiring, hate, and, violence, in, the, equally, criminal, working, classes, he, concluded, it, shows, what, it, is, to, be, a, higher, class, and, i, fear, chicago, univ, is, a, capitalistic, institution, that, is, it, too, belongs, to, the, higher, classes, dewey, was, an, advocate, of, us, participation, in, the, first, world, war, for, this, he, was, criticised, by, randolph, bourne, a, former, student, whose, essay, twilight, of, idols, was, published, in, the, literary, journal, seven, arts, in, october, 1917, bourne, criticised, dewey, s, instrumental, pragmatist, philosophy, as, a, major, advocate, of, academic, freedom,
