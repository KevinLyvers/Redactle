carrying, dr, banda, at, chileka, airport, banda, finally, made, a, showing, on, 6, july, 1958, after, an, absence, of, about, 42, years, in, august, at, nkata, bay, he, was, acclaimed, as, the, leader, of, the, congress, he, soon, began, touring, the, country, speaking, against, the, central, african, federation, also, known, as, the, federation, of, rhodesia, and, nyasaland, and, urging, its, citizens, to, become, members, of, the, party, allegedly, he, was, so, out, of, practice, in, his, native, chichewa, that, he, needed, an, interpreter, a, role, which, was, apparently, performed, by, john, msonthi, and, later, by, john, tembo, who, remained, close, to, him, for, most, of, his, career, he, was, received, enthusiastically, wherever, he, spoke, and, resistance, to, imperialism, among, the, malawians, became, increasingly, common, by, february, 1959, the, situation, had, become, serious, enough, that, rhodesian, troops, were, flown, in, to, help, keep, order, and, a, state, of, emergency, was, declared, on, 3, march, banda, along, with, hundreds, of, other, africans, was, arrested, in, the, course, of, operation, sunrise, he, was, imprisoned, in, gwelo, now, gweru, in,

released, from, prison, in, august, 1959, the, mood, in, britain, meanwhile, had, long, been, moving, towards, decolonisation, due, to, pressure, from, its, colonies, banda, was, released, from, prison, in, april, 1960, and, was, almost, immediately, invited, to, london, for, talks, aimed, at, bringing, about, independence, elections, were, held, in, august, 1961, while, banda, was, technically, nominated, as, minister, of, land, natural, resources, and, local, government, he, became, de, facto, prime, minister, of, nyasaland, a, title, granted, to, him, formally, on, 1, february, 1963, he, and, his, fellow, mcp, ministers, quickly, expanded, secondary, education, reformed, the, so, called, native, courts, ended, certain, colonial, agricultural, tariffs, and, made, other, reforms, in, december, 1962, r, a, butler, british, secretary, of, state, for, african, affairs, essentially, agreed, to, end, the, federation, it, was, banda, himself, who, chose, the, name, malawi, for, the, former, nyasaland, he, had, seen, it, on, an, old, french, map, as, the, name, of, a, lake, maravi, in, the, land, of, the, bororos, and, liked, the, sound, and, appearance, of, the, word, as, malawi, on, 6, july, 1964, exactly, six, years, after, banda, s, return, to, the, country, nyasaland, gained, independence, and, renamed, itself, malawi, barely, a, month, after, independence, malawi, suffered, the, cabinet, crisis, of, 1964, banda, had, already, been, accused, of, autocratic, tendencies, several, of, banda, s, ministers, presented, him, with, proposals, designed, to, limit, his, powers, banda, responded, by, dismissing, four, of, the, ministers, other, ministers, resigned, in, sympathy, the, dissidents, fled, the, country, malawi, adopted, a, new, constitution, on, 6, july, 1966, in, which, the, country, was, declared, a, republic, banda, was, elected, the, country, s, first, president, for, a, five, year, term, he, was, the, only, candidate, the, new, document, granted, banda, wide, executive, and, legislative, powers, and, also, formally, made, the, mcp, the, only, legal, party, however, the, country, had, already, been, a, de, facto, one, party, state, since, independence, the, new, constitution, effectively, turned, banda, s, presidency, into, a, legal, dictatorship, in, 1970, a, congress, of, the, mcp, declared, banda, its, president, for, life, in, 1971, the, legislature, declared, banda, president, for, life, of, malawi, as, well, for, the, next, quarter, century, his, full, title, was, his, excellency, the, life, president, of, the, republic, of, malawi, ngwazi, dr, h, kamazu, banda, the, title, ngwazi, means, saviour, or, conqueror, in, chichewa, banda, was, mostly, viewed, externally, as, a, benign, albeit, eccentric, leader, an, image, fostered, by, his, english, style, three, piece, suits, matching, handkerchiefs, walking, stick, and, fly, whisk, in, june, 1967, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, doctorate, by, the, university, of, massachusetts, with, the, encomium, pediatrician, to, his, infant, nation, however, this, image, masked, a, regime, that, was, rigidly, authoritarian, even, by, african, standards, of, the, time, while, the, constitution, nominally, guaranteed, all, manner, of, civil, liberties, his, government, paid, little, attention, to, them, in, practice, banda, himself, bluntly, summed, up, his, approach, to, ruling, the, country, by, saying, everything, is, my, business, everything, anything, i, say, is, law, literally, law, within, malawi, views, on, him, ranged, from, cult, like, devotion, to, fear, in, 1983, three, ministers, dick, matenje, twaibu, sangala, aaron, gadama, and, member, of, parliament, david, chiwanga, died, in, what, was, labelled, officially, as, a, traffic, accident, banda, had, invited, an, internal, debate, on, pending, multiparty, democracy, in, malawi, during, a, cabinet, meeting, the, three, ministers, had, voiced, support, for, the, multiparty, idea, effectively, challenging, banda, s, claim, to, life, presidency, angered, banda, promptly, dissolved, cabinet, and, announced, that, parliament, would, meet, immediately, at, the, end, of, that, sitting, of, parliament, everyone, in, the, chambers, was, effectively, stripped, of, their, political, status, the, three, men, were, then, rounded, up, at, the, zomba, parliament, buildings, for, questioning, chiwanga, happened, on, them, being, tortured, in, a, back, room, and, had, to, be, silenced, too, the, four, were, later, bundled, into, matenje, s, peugeot, 604, and, driven, to, thambani, in, mwanza, district, west, of, blantyre, where, the, accident, was, staged, sources, reported, that, their, car, had, overturned, while, the, men, had, been, attempting, to, escape, into, neighbouring, mozambique, later, it, was, found, out, they, had, been, killed, by, having, tent, pins, hammered, into, their, heads, banda, ordered, a, night, burial, and, mandated, that, the, caskets, not, be, opened, for, a, last, viewing, during, banda, s, presidency, malawi, initially, refused, to, establish, diplomatic, relations, with, any, of, the, communist, governments, of, eastern, europe, or, asia, however, relations, were, later, established, with, kim, il, sung, s, north, korea, in, 1982, and, with, nicolae, ceau, escu, s, romania, and, enver, hoxha, s, albania, in, 1985, banda, was, one, of, the, few, african, leaders, to, support, the, united, states, in, the, vietnam, war, a, position, he, adopted, in, part, due, to, his, hatred, of, communism, while, many, southern, african, nations, traded, with, apartheid, era, south, africa, out, of, economic, necessity, malawi, was, the, only, african, nation, that, recognised, south, africa, and, established, diplomatic, relations, with, it, including, a, trade, treaty, which, angered, other, african, leaders, they, threatened, to, expel, malawi, from, the, organization, of, african, unity, until, banda, left, power, banda, responded, by, accusing, other, african, countries, of, hypocrisy, saying, in, a, public, speech, to, his, parliament, there, is, no, terror, cassius, in, your, threats, julius, caesar, he, told, them, to, concentrate, on, convincing, the, south, african, government, that, apartheid, was, unnecessary, furthermore, he, added, that, practice, disunity, not, unity, while, posing, as, the, liberators, of, africa, while, they, play, in, the, orchestra, of, pan, africanism, their, own, romes, are, burning, banda, was, the, only, african, ruler, to, establish, diplomatic, ties, with, south, africa, during, apartheid, as, well, as, the, portuguese, regime, in, mozambique, after, the, cabinet, crisis, in, 1964, banda, became, increasingly, isolated, in, african, politics, on, the, other, hand, his, antipathy, for, roy, welensky, and, what, he, denounced, as, the, stupid, federation, was, a, smokescreen, he, used, to, reject, the, proposed, bangula, hydro, electric, dam, proposed, to, be, bigger, than, the, gezira, dam, in, khartoum, that, welensky, s, federation, had, sought, and, obtained, funding, for, from, the, british, government, banda, went, on, to, blame, everything, including, snails, likely, to, cause, widespread, bilharzia, to, abort, the, project, in, turn, the, british, denied, banda, the, funding, and, budgetary, support, he, needed, to, build, his, pet, dream, of, a, new, capital, city, at, lilongwe, in, his, home, region, hence, he, turned, to, south, africa, itself, playing, geo, political, games, in, the, region, which, gave, him, a, soft, loan, of, 300, million, rand, the, quid, pro, quo, was, that, banda, had, to, support, south, africa, s, apartheid, policies, among, fellow, african, leaders, hence, on, one, occasion, he, paid, a, state, visit, to, south, africa, where, he, met, his, south, african, counterparts, at, stellenbosch, banda, once, noted, that, it, is, only, contact, like, this, that, can, reveal, to, your, people, that, there, are, civilized, people, other, than, white, banda, s, staunch, anticommunism, also, influenced, his, decision, to, seek, warm, relations, with, south, africa, after, the, apartheid, era, ended, and, the, anc, came, to, dominate, south, african, politics, during, the, 1990s, relations, between, malawi, and, south, africa, threatened, to, take, a, downward, turn, but, a, malawian, task, force, spearheaded, by, malawian, diplomatic, envoys, to, south, africa, including, sp, kachipande, and, representatives, in, malawi, including, former, diplomat, mr, phiri, arranged, for, a, meeting, between, the, two, governments, which, resulted, in, nelson, mandela, s, first, official, visit, to, malawi, as, president, of, the, anc, in, the, early, 1990s, he, met, with, john, tembo, and, the, president, the, relations, between, the, two, governments, continued, to, be, cordial, after, it, was, revealed, that, banda, was, secretly, helping, the, anc, during, the, apartheid, era, the, malawi, government, and, south, african, government, continued, diplomatic, relations, banda, s, involvement, in, mozambique, dated, back, to, portuguese, colonial, days, in, mozambique, when, banda, supported, the, portuguese, colonial, government, and, guerrilla, forces, that, worked, for, it, following, independence, in, malawi, banda, strengthened, his, relationship, with, the, portuguese, colonial, government, by, appointing, jorge, jardim, as, malawi, s, honorary, consul, in, mozambique, in, september, 1964, he, also, worked, against, liberation, front, of, mozambique, frelimo, forces, in, malawi, in, continued, support, of, the, portuguese, colonial, forces, the, organization, of, african, unity, had, designated, malawi, as, one, of, the, frontline, states, to, help, independence, movements, in, mozambique, by, the, 1980s, banda, supported, both, the, government, and, the, guerrilla, movement, during, the, mozambique, civil, war, he, successfully, gave, the, malawi, army, and, malawi, young, pioneers, opposing, missions, in, mozambique, from, 1987, to, 1992, he, had, the, malawi, army, support, the, mozambican, government, controlled, by, frelimo, after, the, country, s, independence, in, 1975, to, defend, malawi, s, interests, in, mozambique, this, was, done, formally, through, an, agreement, in, 1984, with, samora, machel, simultaneously, banda, used, the, myp, as, couriers, and, active, supporters, of, the, mozambican, national, resistance, renamo, which, had, been, fighting, against, machel, s, government, since, the, late, 1970s, malawi, was, used, to, channel, foreign, aid, from, south, africa, s, apartheid, government, machel, issued, a, dossier, to, frontline, states, with, evidence, that, banda, was, still, supporting, the, insurgents, in, spite, of, the, 1984, agreement, to, stop, by, september, 1986, machel, robert, mugabe, and, kenneth, kaunda, visited, banda, to, persuade, him, to, stop, supporting, renamo, machel, s, successor, joaquim, chissano, continued, to, complain, of, malawi, s, lack, of, willingness, to, stop, supporting, renamo, banda, however, was, trying, to, keep, malawian, interests, in, the, port, of, nacala, in, mozambique, and, did, not, want, to, rely, on, tanzania, and, south, africa, ports, for, its, imports, and, exports, due, to, the, expense, mozambique, and, malawi, came, to, an, agreement, to, place, troops, from, both, countries, in, nayuchi, near, the, port, incidents, of, malawi, army, members, being, killed, over, the, course, of, four, years, angered, the, army, because, myp, members, were, involved, with, the, insurgents, essentially, pitting, the, two, against, each, other, the, end, of, the, cold, war, sounded, the, death, knell, for, banda, s, naked, autocracy, western, leaders, and, international, aid, donors, no, longer, had, any, use, for, authoritarian, anti, communist, regimes, in, the, third, world, all, of, which, came, under, mounting, pressure, to, democratize, donors, told, banda, that, he, had, to, implement, reforms, aimed, at, making, his, government, transparent, and, accountable, to, the, people, and, the, international, community, as, a, condition, for, further, aid, the, british, government, also, stopped, their, financial, support, in, march, 1992, catholic, bishops, in, malawi, issued, a, lenten, pastoral, letter, that, criticized, banda, and, his, government, students, of, the, university, of, malawi, at, chancellor, college, and, the, polytechnic, joined, protests, and, demonstrations, to, support, the, bishops, forcing, authorities, to, close, the, campuses, in, april, 1992, chakufwa, chihana, a, labour, unionist, openly, called, for, a, national, referendum,
