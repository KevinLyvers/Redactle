ghiy, th, al, d, n, ab, al, fat, umar, ibn, ibr, h, m, n, s, b, r, 18, may, 1048, 4, december, 1131, commonly, known, as, omar, khayyam, persian, was, a, persian, polymath, known, for, his, contributions, to, mathematics, astronomy, philosophy, and, poetry, 94, he, was, born, in, nishapur, the, initial, capital, of, the, seljuk, empire, and, lived, during, the, period, of, the, seljuk, dynasty, around, the, time, of, the, first, crusade, as, a, mathematician, he, is, most, notable, for, his, work, on, the, classification, and, solution, of, cubic, equations, where, he, provided, a, geometric, formulation, based, on, the, intersection, of, conics, he, also, contributed, to, a, deeper, understanding, of, euclid, s, parallel, axiom, 284, as, an, astronomer, he, calculated, the, duration, of, the, solar, year, with, remarkable, precision, and, accuracy, and, designed, the, jalali, calendar, a, solar, calendar, with, a, very, precise, 33, year, intercalation, cycle, 659, which, provided, the, basis, for, the, persian, calendar, that, is, still, in, use, after, nearly, a, millennium, there, is, a, tradition, of, attributing, poetry, to, omar, khayyam, written, in, the, form, of, quatrains, rub, iy, t, this, poetry, became, widely, known, to, the, english, reading, world, in, a, translation, by, edward, fitzgerald, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, 1859, which, enjoyed, great, success, in, the, orientalism, of, the, fin, de, si, cle, omar, khayyam, was, born, in, nishapur, a, metropolis, in, khorasan, province, of, persian, stock, in, 1048, in, medieval, persian, texts, he, is, usually, simply, called, omar, khayyam, 658, although, open, to, doubt, it, has, often, been, assumed, that, his, forebears, followed, the, trade, of, tent, making, since, khayyam, means, tent, maker, in, arabic, 30, the, historian, bayhaqi, who, was, personally, acquainted, with, khayyam, provides, the, full, details, of, his, horoscope, he, was, gemini, the, sun, and, mercury, being, in, the, ascendant, 471, 172, 175, no, 66, this, was, used, by, modern, scholars, to, establish, his, date, of, birth, as, 18, may, 1048, 658, khayyam, s, boyhood, was, spent, in, nishapur, 659, a, leading, metropolis, under, the, great, seljuq, empire, 15, which, had, earlier, been, a, major, center, of, the, zoroastrian, religion, 68, his, full, name, as, it, appears, in, arabic, sources, was, abu, l, fath, omar, ibn, ibrahim, al, khayyam, his, gifts, were, recognized, by, his, early, tutors, who, sent, him, to, study, under, imam, muwaffaq, nishaburi, the, greatest, teacher, of, the, khorasan, region, who, tutored, the, children, of, the, highest, nobility, and, khayyam, developed, a, firm, friendship, with, him, through, the, years, 20, khayyam, might, have, met, and, studied, with, bahmanyar, a, disciple, of, avicenna, 20, 21, after, studying, science, philosophy, mathematics, and, astronomy, at, nishapur, about, the, year, 1068, he, traveled, to, the, province, of, bukhara, where, he, frequented, the, renowned, library, of, the, ark, in, about, 1070, he, moved, to, samarkand, where, he, started, to, compose, his, famous, treatise, on, algebra, under, the, patronage, of, abu, tahir, abd, al, rahman, ibn, alaq, the, governor, and, chief, judge, of, the, city, 4330b, khayyam, was, kindly, received, by, the, karakhanid, ruler, shams, al, mulk, nasr, who, according, to, bayhaqi, would, show, him, the, greatest, honour, so, much, so, that, he, would, seat, beside, him, on, his, throne, 34, 47, in, 1073, 4, peace, was, concluded, with, sultan, malik, shah, i, who, had, made, incursions, into, karakhanid, dominions, khayyam, entered, the, service, of, malik, shah, in, 1074, when, he, was, invited, by, the, grand, vizier, nizam, al, mulk, to, meet, malik, shah, in, the, city, of, marv, khayyam, was, subsequently, commissioned, to, set, up, an, observatory, in, isfahan, and, lead, a, group, of, scientists, in, carrying, out, precise, astronomical, observations, aimed, at, the, revision, of, the, persian, calendar, the, undertaking, probably, began, with, the, opening, of, the, observatory, in, 1074, and, ended, in, 1079, 28, 29, when, omar, khayyam, and, his, colleagues, concluded, their, measurements, of, the, length, of, the, year, reporting, it, as, 365, 24219858156, days, given, that, the, length, of, the, year, is, changing, in, the, sixth, decimal, place, over, a, person, s, lifetime, this, is, outstandingly, accurate, for, comparison, the, length, of, the, year, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, was, 365, 242196, days, while, today, it, is, 365, 242190, days, after, the, death, of, malik, shah, and, his, vizier, murdered, it, is, thought, by, the, ismaili, order, of, assassins, khayyam, fell, from, favor, at, court, and, as, a, result, he, soon, set, out, on, his, pilgrimage, to, mecca, a, possible, ulterior, motive, for, his, pilgrimage, reported, by, al, qifti, was, a, public, demonstration, of, his, faith, with, a, view, to, allaying, suspicions, of, skepticism, and, confuting, the, allegations, of, unorthodoxy, including, possible, sympathy, or, adherence, to, zoroastrianism, levelled, at, him, by, a, hostile, clergy, 29, 29, he, was, then, invited, by, the, new, sultan, sanjar, to, marv, possibly, to, work, as, a, court, astrologer, he, was, later, allowed, to, return, to, nishapur, owing, to, his, declining, health, upon, his, return, he, seems, to, have, lived, the, life, of, a, recluse, 99, omar, khayyam, died, at, the, age, of, 83, in, his, hometown, of, nishapur, on, 4, december, 1131, and, he, is, buried, in, what, is, now, the, mausoleum, of, omar, khayyam, one, of, his, disciples, nizami, aruzi, relates, the, story, that, sometime, during, 1112, 3, khayyam, was, in, balkh, in, the, company, of, isfizari, one, of, the, scientists, who, had, collaborated, with, him, on, the, jalali, calendar, when, he, made, a, prophecy, that, my, tomb, shall, be, in, a, spot, where, the, north, wind, may, scatter, roses, over, it, 36, four, years, after, his, death, aruzi, located, his, tomb, in, a, cemetery, in, a, then, large, and, well, known, quarter, of, nishapur, on, the, road, to, marv, as, it, had, been, foreseen, by, khayyam, aruzi, found, the, tomb, situated, at, the, foot, of, a, garden, wall, over, which, pear, trees, and, peach, trees, had, thrust, their, heads, and, dropped, their, flowers, so, that, his, tombstone, was, hidden, beneath, them, 37, khayyam, was, famous, during, his, life, as, a, mathematician, his, surviving, mathematical, works, include, i, commentary, on, the, difficulties, concerning, the, postulates, of, euclid, s, elements, ris, la, f, shar, m, ashkal, min, mu, dar, t, kit, b, uql, dis, completed, in, december, 1077, 832a, 1, 324b, ii, treatise, on, the, division, of, a, quadrant, of, a, circle, ris, lah, f, qismah, rub, al, d, irah, undated, but, completed, prior, to, the, treatise, on, algebra, 831b, 2, and, iii, treatise, on, algebra, ris, lah, fi, al, jabr, wa, l, muq, bala, 831b, 832a, 3, most, likely, completed, in, 1079, 281, he, furthermore, wrote, a, treatise, on, the, binomial, theorem, and, extracting, the, n, th, root, of, natural, numbers, which, has, been, lost, 197, 832a, 4, 325b, 326b, part, of, khayyam, s, commentary, on, the, difficulties, concerning, the, postulates, of, euclid, s, elements, deals, with, the, parallel, axiom, 282, the, treatise, of, khayyam, can, be, considered, the, first, treatment, of, the, axiom, not, based, on, petitio, principii, but, on, a, more, intuitive, postulate, khayyam, refutes, the, previous, attempts, by, other, mathematicians, to, prove, the, proposition, mainly, on, grounds, that, each, of, them, had, postulated, something, that, was, by, no, means, easier, to, admit, than, the, fifth, postulate, itself, 1, 326b, 327b, 75, drawing, upon, aristotle, s, views, he, rejects, the, usage, of, movement, in, geometry, and, therefore, dismisses, the, different, attempt, by, ibn, al, haytham, 64, 65, 270, unsatisfied, with, the, failure, of, mathematicians, to, prove, euclid, s, statement, from, his, other, postulates, khayyam, tried, to, connect, the, axiom, with, the, fourth, postulate, which, states, that, all, right, angles, are, equal, to, one, another, 282, khayyam, was, the, first, to, consider, the, three, distinct, cases, of, acute, obtuse, and, right, angle, for, the, summit, angles, of, a, khayyam, saccheri, quadrilateral, 283, after, proving, a, number, of, theorems, about, them, he, showed, that, postulate, v, follows, from, the, right, angle, hypothesis, and, refuted, the, obtuse, and, acute, cases, as, self, contradictory, 270, 133, his, elaborate, attempt, to, prove, the, parallel, postulate, was, significant, for, the, further, development, of, geometry, as, it, clearly, shows, the, possibility, of, non, euclidean, geometries, the, hypotheses, of, acute, obtuse, and, right, angles, are, now, known, to, lead, respectively, to, the, non, euclidean, hyperbolic, geometry, of, gauss, bolyai, lobachevsky, to, that, of, riemannian, geometry, and, to, euclidean, geometry, tusi, s, commentaries, on, khayyam, s, treatment, of, parallels, made, its, way, to, europe, john, wallis, professor, of, geometry, at, oxford, translated, tusi, s, commentary, into, latin, jesuit, geometer, girolamo, saccheri, whose, work, euclides, ab, omni, naevo, vindicatus, 1733, is, generally, considered, the, first, step, in, the, eventual, development, of, non, euclidean, geometry, was, familiar, with, the, work, of, wallis, the, american, historian, of, mathematics, david, eugene, smith, mentions, that, saccheri, used, the, same, lemma, as, the, one, of, tusi, even, lettering, the, figure, in, precisely, the, same, way, and, using, the, lemma, for, the, same, purpose, he, further, says, that, tusi, distinctly, states, that, it, is, due, to, omar, khayyam, and, from, the, text, it, seems, clear, that, the, latter, was, his, inspirer, 195, 104, this, treatise, on, euclid, contains, another, contribution, dealing, with, the, theory, of, proportions, and, with, the, compounding, of, ratios, khayyam, discusses, the, relationship, between, the, concept, of, ratio, and, the, concept, of, number, and, explicitly, raises, various, theoretical, difficulties, in, particular, he, contributes, to, the, theoretical, study, of, the, concept, of, irrational, number, displeased, with, euclid, s, definition, of, equal, ratios, he, redefined, the, concept, of, a, number, by, the, use, of, a, continued, fraction, as, the, means, of, expressing, a, ratio, youschkevitch, and, rosenfeld, argue, that, by, placing, irrational, quantities, and, numbers, on, the, same, operational, scale, began, a, true, revolution, in, the, doctrine, of, number, 327b, likewise, it, was, noted, by, d, j, struik, that, omar, was, on, the, road, to, that, extension, of, the, number, concept, which, leads, to, the, notion, of, the, real, number, 284, rashed, and, vahabzadeh, 2000, have, argued, that, because, of, his, thoroughgoing, geometrical, approach, to, algebraic, equations, khayyam, can, be, considered, the, precursor, of, descartes, in, the, invention, of, analytic, geometry, 248, in, the, treatise, on, the, division, of, a, quadrant, of, a, circle, khayyam, applied, algebra, to, geometry, in, this, work, he, devoted, himself, mainly, to, investigating, whether, it, is, possible, to, divide, a, circular, quadrant, into, two, parts, such, that, the, line, segments, projected, from, the, dividing, point, to, the, perpendicular, diameters, of, the, circle, form, a, specific, ratio, his, solution, in, turn, employed, several, curve, constructions, that, led, to, equations, containing, cubic, and, quadratic, terms, 248, khayyam, seems, to, have, been, the, first, to, conceive, a, general, theory, of, cubic, equations, and, the, first, to, geometrically, solve, every, type, of, cubic, equation, so, far, as, positive, roots, are, concerned, the, treatise, on, algebra, contains, his, work, on, cubic, equations, 9, it, is, divided, into, three, parts, i, equations, which, can, be, solved, with, compass, and, straight, edge, ii, equations, which, can, be, solved, by, means, of, conic, sections, and, iii, equations, which, involve, the, inverse, of, the, unknown, 3, khayyam, produced, an, exhaustive, list, of, all, possible, equations, involving, lines, squares, and, cubes, 43, he, considered, three, binomial, equations, nine, trinomial, equations, and, seven, tetranomial, equations, 281, for, the, first, and, second, degree, polynomials, he, provided, numerical, solutions, by, geometric, construction, he, concluded, that, there, are, fourteen, different, types, of, cubics, that, cannot, be, reduced, to, an, equation, of, a, lesser, degree, 831b, 328a, 49, for, these, he, could, not, accomplish, the, construction, of, his, unknown, segment, with, compass, and, straight, edge, he, proceeded, to, present, geometric, solutions, to, all, types, of, cubic, equations, using, the, properties, of, conic, sections, 281, 157, the, prerequisite, lemmas, for, khayyam, s, geometrical, proof, include, euclid, vi, prop, 13, and, apollonius, ii, prop, 12, 155, the, positive, root, of, a, cubic, equation, was, determined, as, the, abscissa, of, a, point, of, intersection, of, two, conics, for, instance, the, intersection, of, two, parabolas, or, the, intersection, of, a, parabola, and, a, circle, etc, 141, however, he, acknowledged, that, the, arithmetic, problem, of, these, cubics, was, still, unsolved, adding, that, possibly, someone, else, will, come, to, know, it, after, us, 158, this, task, remained, open, until, the, sixteenth, century, where, an, algebraic, solution, of, the, cubic, equation, was, found, in, its, generality, by, cardano, del, ferro, and, tartaglia, in, renaissance, italy, 282, whoever, thinks, algebra, is, a, trick, in, obtaining, unknowns, has, thought, it, in, vain, no, attention, should, be, paid, to, the, fact, that, algebra, and, geometry, are, different, in, appearance, algebras, are, geometric, facts, which, are, proved, by, propositions, five, and, six, of, book, two, of, elements, omar, khayyam, in, effect, khayyam, s, work, is, an, effort, to, unify, algebra, and, geometry, 241, this, particular, geometric, solution, of, cubic, equations, was, further, investigated, by, m, hachtroudi, and, extended, to, solving, fourth, degree, equations, although, similar, methods, had, appeared, sporadically, since, menaechmus, and, further, developed, by, the, 10th, century, mathematician, abu, al, jud, 29, 110, khayyam, s, work, can, be, considered, the, first, systematic, study, and, the, first, exact, method, of, solving, cubic, equations, 92, the, mathematician, woepcke, 1851, who, offered, translations, of, khayyam, s, algebra, into, french, praised, him, for, his, power, of, generalization, and, his, rigorously, systematic, procedure, 10, from, the, indians, one, has, methods, for, obtaining, square, and, cube, roots, methods, based, on, knowledge, of, individual, cases, namely, the, knowledge, of, the, squares, of, the, nine, digits, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 2, etc, and, their, respective, products, i, e, 2, 3, etc, we, have, written, a, treatise, on, the, proof, of, the, validity, of, those, methods, and, that, they, satisfy, the, conditions, in, addition, we, have, increased, their, types, namely, in, the, form, of, the, determination, of, the, fourth, fifth, sixth, roots, up, to, any, desired, degree, no, one, preceded, us, in, this, and, those, proofs, are, purely, arithmetic, founded, on, the, arithmetic, of, the, elements, omar, khayyam, treatise, on, algebra, in, his, algebraic, treatise, khayyam, alludes, to, a, book, he, had, written, on, the, extraction, of, the, n, displaystyle, n, th, root, of, natural, numbers, using, a, law, he, had, discovered, which, did, not, depend, on, geometric, figures, this, book, was, most, likely, titled, the, difficulties, of, arithmetic, mushkil, t, al, is, b, 832a, 4, and, is, not, extant, 325b, based, on, the, context, some, historians, of, mathematics, such, as, d, j, struik, believe, that, omar, must, have, known, the, formula, for, the, expansion, of, the, binomial, a, b, n, displaystyle, a, b, n, where, n, is, a, positive, integer, 282, the, case, of, power, 2, is, explicitly, stated, in, euclid, s, elements, and, the, case, of, at, most, power, 3, had, been, established, by, indian, mathematicians, khayyam, was, the, mathematician, who, noticed, the, importance, of, a, general, binomial, theorem, the, argument, supporting, the, claim, that, khayyam, had, a, general, binomial, theorem, is, based, on, his, ability, to, extract, roots, one, of, khayyam, s, predecessors, al, karaji, had, already, discovered, the, triangular, arrangement, of, the, coefficients, of, binomial, expansions, that, europeans, later, came, to, know, as, pascal, s, triangle, 60, khayyam, popularized, this, triangular, array, in, iran, so, that, it, is, now, known, as, omar, khayyam, s, triangle, in, 1074, 5, omar, khayyam, was, commissioned, by, sultan, malik, shah, to, build, an, observatory, at, isfahan, and, reform, the, persian, calendar, there, was, a, panel, of, eight, scholars, working, under, the, direction, of, khayyam, to, make, large, scale, astronomical, observations, and, revise, the, astronomical, tables, 141, recalibrating, the, calendar, fixed, the, first, day, of, the, year, at, the, exact, moment, of, the, passing, of, the, sun, s, center, across, vernal, equinox, this, marks, the, beginning, of, spring, or, nowr, z, a, day, in, which, the, sun, enters, the, first, degree, of, aries, before, noon, 10, 11, the, resultant, calendar, was, named, in, malik, shah, s, honor, as, the, jal, l, calendar, and, was, inaugurated, on, 15, march, 1079, 269, the, observatory, itself, was, disused, after, the, death, of, malik, shah, in, 1092, 659, the, jal, l, calendar, was, a, true, solar, calendar, where, the, duration, of, each, month, is, equal, to, the, time, of, the, passage, of, the, sun, across, the, corresponding, sign, of, the, zodiac, the, calendar, reform, introduced, a, unique, 33, year, intercalation, cycle, as, indicated, by, the, works, of, khazini, khayyam, s, group, implemented, an, intercalation, system, based, on, quadrennial, and, quinquennial, leap, years, therefore, the, calendar, consisted, of, 25, ordinary, years, that, included, 365, days, and, 8, leap, years, that, included, 366, days, 13, the, calendar, remained, in, use, across, greater, iran, from, the, 11th, to, the, 20th, centuries, in, 1911, the, jalali, calendar, became, the, official, national, calendar, of, qajar, iran, in, 1925, this, calendar, was, simplified, and, the, names, of, the, months, were, modernized, resulting, in, the, modern, iranian, calendar, the, jalali, calendar, is, more, accurate, than, the, gregorian, calendar, of, 1582, 659, with, an, error, of, one, day, accumulating, over, 5, 000, years, compared, to, one, day, every, 3, 330, years, in, the, gregorian, calendar, 200, moritz, cantor, considered, it, the, most, perfect, calendar, ever, devised, 101, one, of, his, pupils, nizami, aruzi, of, samarcand, relates, that, khayyam, apparently, did, not, have, a, belief, in, astrology, and, divination, i, did, not, observe, that, he, scil, omar, khayyam, had, any, great, belief, in, astrological, predictions, nor, have, i, seen, or, heard, of, any, of, the, great, who, had, such, belief, 11, while, working, for, sultan, sanjar, as, an, astrologer, he, was, asked, to, predict, the, weather, a, job, that, he, apparently, did, not, do, well, 30, george, saliba, explains, that, the, term, ilm, al, nuj, m, used, in, various, sources, in, which, references, to, khayyam, s, life, and, work, could, be, found, has, sometimes, been, incorrectly, translated, to, mean, astrology, he, adds, from, at, least, the, middle, of, the, tenth, century, according, to, farabi, s, enumeration, of, the, sciences, that, this, science, ilm, al, nuj, m, was, already, split, into, two, parts, one, dealing, with, astrology, and, the, other, with, theoretical, mathematical, astronomy, 224, khayyam, has, a, short, treatise, devoted, to, archimedes, principle, in, full, title, on, the, deception, of, knowing, the, two, quantities, of, gold, and, silver, in, a, compound, made, of, the, two, for, a, compound, of, gold, adulterated, with, silver, he, describes, a, method, to, measure, more, exactly, the, weight, per, capacity, of, each, element, it, involves, weighing, the, compound, both, in, air, and, in, water, since, weights, are, easier, to, measure, exactly, than, volumes, by, repeating, the, same, with, both, gold, and, silver, one, finds, exactly, how, much, heavier, than, water, gold, silver, and, the, compound, were, this, treatise, was, extensively, examined, by, eilhard, wiedemann, who, believed, that, khayyam, s, solution, was, more, accurate, and, sophisticated, than, that, of, khazini, and, al, nayrizi, who, also, dealt, with, the, subject, elsewhere, 198, another, short, treatise, is, concerned, with, music, theory, in, which, he, discusses, the, connection, between, music, and, arithmetic, khayyam, s, contribution, was, in, providing, a, systematic, classification, of, musical, scales, and, discussing, the, mathematical, relationship, among, notes, minor, major, and, tetrachords, 198, the, earliest, allusion, to, omar, khayyam, s, poetry, is, from, the, historian, imad, ad, din, al, isfahani, a, younger, contemporary, of, khayyam, who, explicitly, identifies, him, as, both, a, poet, and, a, scientist, kharidat, al, qasr, 1174, 49, 35, one, of, the, earliest, specimens, of, omar, khayyam, s, rubiyat, is, from, fakhr, al, din, razi, in, his, work, al, tanbih, ala, ba, d, asrar, al, maw, dat, fi, l, qur, an, c, 1160, he, quotes, one, of, his, poems, corresponding, to, quatrain, lxii, of, fitzgerald, s, first, edition, daya, in, his, writings, mir, d, al, ibad, c, 1230, quotes, two, quatrains, one, of, which, is, the, same, as, the, one, already, reported, by, razi, an, additional, quatrain, is, quoted, by, the, historian, juvayni, tarikh, i, jahangushay, c, 1226, 1283, 36, 37, 92, in, 1340, jajarmi, includes, thirteen, quatrains, of, khayyam, in, his, work, containing, an, anthology, of, the, works, of, famous, persian, poets, mu, nis, al, ahr, r, two, of, which, have, hitherto, been, known, from, the, older, sources, 434, a, comparatively, late, manuscript, is, the, bodleian, ms, ouseley, 140, written, in, shiraz, in, 1460, which, contains, 158, quatrains, on, 47, folia, the, manuscript, belonged, to, william, ouseley, 1767, 1842, and, was, purchased, by, the, bodleian, library, in, 1844, there, are, occasional, quotes, of, verses, attributed, to, khayyam, in, texts, attributed, to, authors, of, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, but, these, are, of, doubtful, authenticity, so, that, skeptical, scholars, point, out, that, the, entire, tradition, may, be, pseudepigraphic, 11, hans, heinrich, schaeder, in, 1934, commented, that, the, name, of, omar, khayyam, is, to, be, struck, out, from, the, history, of, persian, literature, due, to, the, lack, of, any, material, that, could, confidently, be, attributed, to, him, de, blois, presents, a, bibliography, of, the, manuscript, tradition, concluding, pessimistically, that, the, situation, has, not, changed, significantly, since, schaeder, s, time, 307, five, of, the, quatrains, later, attributed, to, omar, khayyam, are, found, as, early, as, 30, years, after, his, death, quoted, in, sindbad, nameh, while, this, establishes, that, these, specific, verses, were, in, circulation, in, omar, s, time, or, shortly, later, it, does, not, imply, that, the, verses, must, be, his, de, blois, concludes, that, at, the, least, the, process, of, attributing, poetry, to, omar, khayyam, appears, to, have, begun, already, in, the, 13th, century, 305, edward, granville, browne, 1906, notes, the, difficulty, of, disentangling, authentic, from, spurious, quatrains, while, it, is, certain, that, khayyam, wrote, many, quatrains, it, is, hardly, possible, save, in, a, few, exceptional, cases, to, assert, positively, that, he, wrote, any, of, those, ascribed, to, him, 663, in, addition, to, the, persian, quatrains, there, are, twenty, five, arabic, poems, attributed, to, khayyam, which, are, attested, by, historians, such, as, al, isfahani, shahrazuri, nuzhat, al, arwah, c, 1201, 1211, qifti, t, rikh, al, hukam, 1255, and, hamdallah, mustawfi, tarikh, i, guzida, 1339, 39, boyle, emphasized, that, there, are, a, number, of, other, persian, scholars, who, occasionally, wrote, quatrains, including, avicenna, ghazali, and, tusi, they, conclude, that, it, is, also, possible, that, for, khayyam, poetry, was, an, amusement, of, his, leisure, hours, these, brief, poems, seem, often, to, have, been, the, work, of, scholars, and, scientists, who, composed, them, perhaps, in, moments, of, relaxation, to, edify, or, amuse, the, inner, circle, of, their, disciples, 662, the, poetry, attributed, to, omar, khayyam, has, contributed, greatly, to, his, popular, fame, in, the, modern, period, as, a, direct, result, of, the, extreme, popularity, of, the, translation, of, such, verses, into, english, by, edward, fitzgerald, 1859, fitzgerald, s, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, contains, loose, translations, of, quatrains, from, the, bodleian, manuscript, it, enjoyed, such, success, in, the, fin, de, si, cle, period, that, a, bibliography, compiled, in, 1929, listed, more, than, 300, separate, editions, and, many, more, have, been, published, since, 312, khayyam, considered, himself, intellectually, to, be, a, student, of, avicenna, 474, according, to, al, bayhaqi, he, was, reading, the, metaphysics, in, avicenna, s, the, book, of, healing, before, he, died, 661, there, are, six, philosophical, papers, believed, to, have, been, written, by, khayyam, one, of, them, on, existence, fi, l, wuj, d, was, written, originally, in, persian, and, deals, with, the, subject, of, existence, and, its, relationship, to, universals, another, paper, titled, the, necessity, of, contradiction, in, the, world, determinism, and, subsistence, darurat, al, tad, d, fi, l, lam, wa, l, jabr, wa, l, baq, is, written, in, arabic, and, deals, with, free, will, and, determinism, 475, the, titles, of, his, other, works, are, on, being, and, necessity, ris, lah, f, l, kawn, wa, l, takl, f, the, treatise, on, transcendence, in, existence, al, ris, lah, al, ul, fi, l, wuj, d, on, the, knowledge, of, the, universal, principles, of, existence, ris, lah, dar, ilm, kulliy, t, i, wuj, d, and, abridgement, concerning, natural, phenomena, mukhtasar, fi, l, tabi, iyy, t, khayyam, himself, once, said, 431, we, are, the, victims, of, an, age, when, men, of, science, are, discredited, and, only, a, few, remain, who, are, capable, of, engaging, in, scientific, research, our, philosophers, spend, all, their, time, in, mixing, true, with, false, and, are, interested, in, nothing, but, outward, show, such, little, learning, as, they, have, they, extend, on, material, ends, when, they, see, a, man, sincere, and, unremitting, in, his, search, for, the, truth, one, who, will, have, nothing, to, do, with, falsehood, and, pretence, they, mock, and, despise, him, a, literal, reading, of, khayyam, s, quatrains, leads, to, the, interpretation, of, his, philosophic, attitude, toward, life, as, a, combination, of, pessimism, nihilism, epicureanism, fatalism, and, agnosticism, 6, this, view, is, taken, by, iranologists, such, as, arthur, christensen, hans, heinrich, schaeder, john, andrew, boyle, edward, denison, ross, 365, edward, henry, whinfield, 40, and, george, sarton, 18, conversely, the, khayyamic, quatrains, have, also, been, described, as, mystical, sufi, poetry, in, addition, to, his, persian, quatrains, j, c, e, bowen, mentions, that, khayyam, s, arabic, poems, also, express, a, pessimistic, viewpoint, which, is, entirely, consonant, with, the, outlook, of, the, deeply, thoughtful, rationalist, philosopher, that, khayyam, is, known, historically, to, have, been, 69, edward, fitzgerald, emphasized, the, religious, skepticism, he, found, in, khayyam, in, his, preface, to, the, rub, iy, t, he, claimed, that, he, was, hated, and, dreaded, by, the, sufis, and, denied, any, pretense, at, divine, allegory, his, wine, is, the, veritable, juice, of, the, grape, his, tavern, where, it, was, to, be, had, his, saki, the, flesh, and, blood, that, poured, it, out, for, him, 62, sadegh, hedayat, is, one, of, the, most, notable, proponents, of, khayyam, s, philosophy, as, agnostic, skepticism, and, according, to, jan, rypka, 1934, he, even, considered, khayyam, an, atheist, hedayat, 1923, states, that, while, khayyam, believes, in, the, transmutation, and, transformation, of, the, human, body, he, does, not, believe, in, a, separate, soul, if, we, are, lucky, our, bodily, particles, would, be, used, in, the, making, of, a, jug, of, wine, 138, omar, khayyam, s, poetry, has, been, cited, in, the, context, of, new, atheism, such, as, in, the, portable, atheist, by, christopher, hitchens, 7, al, qifti, c, 1172, 1248, appears, to, confirm, this, view, of, khayyam, s, philosophy, 663, in, his, work, the, history, of, learned, men, he, reports, that, khayyam, s, poems, were, only, outwardly, in, the, sufi, style, but, were, written, with, an, anti, religious, agenda, 365, he, also, mentions, that, he, was, at, one, point, indicted, for, impiety, but, went, on, a, pilgrimage, to, prove, he, was, pious, 29, the, report, has, it, that, upon, returning, to, his, native, city, he, concealed, his, deepest, convictions, and, practised, a, strictly, religious, life, going, morning, and, evening, to, the, place, of, worship, 355, khayyam, on, the, koran, quote, 84, the, koran, well, come, put, me, to, the, test, lovely, old, book, in, hideous, error, drest, believe, me, i, can, quote, the, koran, too, the, unbeliever, knows, his, koran, best, and, do, you, think, that, unto, such, as, you, a, maggot, minded, starved, fanatic, crew, god, gave, the, secret, and, denied, it, me, well, well, what, matters, it, believe, that, too, look, not, above, there, is, no, answer, there, pray, not, for, no, one, listens, to, your, prayer, near, is, as, near, to, god, as, any, far, and, here, is, just, the, same, deceit, as, there, men, talk, of, heaven, there, is, no, heaven, but, here, men, talk, of, hell, there, is, no, hell, but, here, men, of, hereafters, talk, and, future, lives, o, love, there, is, no, other, life, but, here, an, account, of, him, written, in, the, thirteenth, century, shows, him, as, versed, in, all, the, wisdom, of, the, greeks, and, as, wont, to, insist, on, the, necessity, of, studying, science, on, greek, lines, of, his, prose, works, two, which, were, stand, authority, dealt, respectively, with, precious, stones, and, climatology, beyond, question, the, poet, astronomer, was, undevout, and, his, astronomy, doubtless, helped, to, make, him, so, one, contemporary, writes, i, did, not, observe, that, he, had, any, great, belief, in, astrological, predictions, nor, have, i, seen, or, heard, of, any, of, the, great, scientists, who, had, such, belief, he, gave, his, adherence, to, no, religious, sect, agnosticism, not, faith, is, the, keynote, of, his, works, among, the, sects, he, saw, everywhere, strife, and, hatred, in, which, he, could, have, no, part, 263, vol, 1, persian, novelist, sadegh, hedayat, says, khayy, m, from, his, youth, to, his, death, remained, a, materialist, pessimist, agnostic, khayyam, looked, at, all, religions, questions, with, a, skeptical, eye, continues, hedayat, and, hated, the, fanaticism, narrow, mindedness, and, the, spirit, of, vengeance, of, the, mullas, the, so, called, religious, scholars, 13, in, the, context, of, a, piece, entitled, on, the, knowledge, of, the, principles, of, existence, khayyam, endorses, the, sufi, path, 8, csillik, suggests, the, possibility, that, omar, khayyam, could, see, in, sufism, an, ally, against, orthodox, religiosity, 75, other, commentators, do, not, accept, that, khayyam, s, poetry, has, an, anti, religious, agenda, and, interpret, his, references, to, wine, and, drunkenness, in, the, conventional, metaphorical, sense, common, in, sufism, the, french, translator, j, b, nicolas, held, that, khayyam, s, constant, exhortations, to, drink, wine, should, not, be, taken, literally, but, should, be, regarded, rather, in, the, light, of, sufi, thought, where, rapturous, intoxication, by, wine, is, to, be, understood, as, a, metaphor, for, the, enlightened, state, or, divine, rapture, of, baqaa, the, view, of, omar, khayyam, as, a, sufi, was, defended, by, bjerregaard, 3, idries, shah, 165, 166, and, dougan, who, attributes, the, reputation, of, hedonism, to, the, failings, of, fitzgerald, s, translation, arguing, that, khayyam, s, poetry, is, to, be, understood, as, deeply, esoteric, on, the, other, hand, iranian, experts, such, as, mohammad, ali, foroughi, and, mojtaba, minovi, rejected, the, hypothesis, that, omar, khayyam, was, a, sufi, 72, foroughi, stated, that, khayyam, s, ideas, may, have, been, consistent, with, that, of, sufis, at, times, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, he, was, formally, a, sufi, aminrazavi, states, that, sufi, interpretation, of, khayyam, is, possible, only, by, reading, into, his, rub, yy, t, extensively, and, by, stretching, the, content, to, fit, the, classical, sufi, doctrine, 128, furthermore, boyle, emphasizes, that, khayyam, was, intensely, disliked, by, a, number, of, celebrated, sufi, mystics, who, belonged, to, the, same, century, this, includes, shams, tabrizi, spiritual, guide, of, rumi, 58, najm, al, din, daya, who, described, omar, khayyam, as, an, unhappy, philosopher, atheist, and, materialist, 71, and, attar, who, regarded, him, not, as, a, fellow, mystic, but, a, free, thinking, scientist, who, awaited, punishments, hereafter, 663, 664, seyyed, hossein, nasr, argues, that, it, is, reductive, to, use, a, literal, interpretation, of, his, verses, many, of, which, are, of, uncertain, authenticity, to, begin, with, to, establish, omar, khayyam, s, philosophy, instead, he, adduces, khayyam, s, interpretive, translation, of, avicenna, s, treatise, discourse, on, unity, al, khutbat, al, tawh, d, where, he, expresses, orthodox, views, on, divine, unity, in, agreement, with, the, author, ch, 9, 165, 183, the, prose, works, believed, to, be, khayyam, s, are, written, in, the, peripatetic, style, and, are, explicitly, theistic, dealing, with, subjects, such, as, the, existence, of, god, and, theodicy, 160, as, noted, by, bowen, these, works, indicate, his, involvement, in, the, problems, of, metaphysics, rather, than, in, the, subtleties, of, sufism, 71, as, evidence, of, khayyam, s, faith, and, or, conformity, to, islamic, customs, aminrazavi, mentions, that, in, his, treatises, he, offers, salutations, and, prayers, praising, god, and, muhammad, in, most, biographical, extracts, he, is, referred, to, with, religious, honorifics, such, as, im, m, the, patron, of, faith, gh, y, th, al, d, n, and, the, evidence, of, truth, hujjat, al, haqq, he, also, notes, that, biographers, who, praise, his, religiosity, generally, avoid, making, reference, to, his, poetry, while, the, ones, who, mention, his, poetry, often, do, not, praise, his, religious, character, 48, for, instance, al, bayhaqi, s, account, which, antedates, by, some, years, other, biographical, notices, speaks, of, omar, as, a, very, pious, man, who, professed, orthodox, views, down, to, his, last, hour, 174, on, the, basis, of, all, the, existing, textual, and, biographical, evidence, the, question, remains, somewhat, open, 11, and, as, a, result, khayyam, has, received, sharply, conflicting, appreciations, and, criticisms, 350, the, various, biographical, extracts, referring, to, omar, khayyam, describe, him, as, unequalled, in, scientific, knowledge, and, achievement, during, his, time, many, called, him, by, the, epithet, king, of, the, wise, arabic, 436, 141, shahrazuri, d, 1300, esteems, him, highly, as, a, mathematician, and, claims, that, he, may, be, regarded, as, the, successor, of, avicenna, in, the, various, branches, of, philosophic, learning, 352, al, qifti, d, 1248, even, though, disagreeing, with, his, views, concedes, he, was, unrivalled, in, his, knowledge, of, natural, philosophy, and, astronomy, 355, despite, being, hailed, as, a, poet, by, a, number, of, biographers, according, to, richard, n, frye, it, is, still, possible, to, argue, that, khayyam, s, status, as, a, poet, of, the, first, rank, is, a, comparatively, late, development, 663, thomas, hyde, was, the, first, european, to, call, attention, to, khayyam, and, to, translate, one, of, his, quatrains, into, latin, historia, religionis, veterum, persarum, eorumque, magorum, 1700, 525, western, interest, in, persia, grew, with, the, orientalism, movement, in, the, 19th, century, joseph, von, hammer, purgstall, 1774, 1856, translated, some, of, khayyam, s, poems, into, german, in, 1818, and, gore, ouseley, 1770, 1844, into, english, in, 1846, but, khayyam, remained, relatively, unknown, in, the, west, until, after, the, publication, of, edward, fitzgerald, s, rubaiyat, of, omar, khayyam, in, 1859, fitzgerald, s, work, at, first, was, unsuccessful, but, was, popularised, by, whitley, stokes, from, 1861, onward, and, the, work, came, to, be, greatly, admired, by, the, pre, raphaelites, in, 1872, fitzgerald, had, a, third, edition, printed, which, increased, interest, in, the, work, in, america, by, the, 1880s, the, book, was, extremely, well, known, throughout, the, english, speaking, world, to, the, extent, of, the, formation, of, numerous, omar, khayyam, clubs, and, a, fin, de, si, cle, cult, of, the, rubaiyat, 202, khayyam, s, poems, have, been, translated, into, many, languages, many, of, the, more, recent, ones, are, more, literal, than, that, of, fitzgerald, fitzgerald, s, translation, was, a, factor, in, rekindling, interest, in, khayyam, as, a, poet, even, in, his, native, iran, 55, 72, sadegh, hedayat, in, his, songs, of, khayyam, taranehha, ye, khayyam, 1934, reintroduced, khayyam, s, poetic, legacy, to, modern, iran, under, the, pahlavi, dynasty, a, new, monument, of, white, marble, designed, by, the, architect, houshang, seyhoun, was, erected, over, his, tomb, a, statue, by, abolhassan, sadighi, was, erected, in, laleh, park, tehran, in, the, 1960s, and, a, bust, by, the, same, sculptor, was, placed, near, khayyam, s, mausoleum, in, nishapur, in, 2009, the, state, of, iran, donated, a, pavilion, to, the, united, nations, office, in, vienna, inaugurated, at, vienna, international, center, in, 2016, three, statues, of, khayyam, were, unveiled, one, at, the, university, of, oklahoma, one, in, nishapur, and, one, in, florence, italy, over, 150, composers, have, used, the, rubaiyat, as, their, source, of, inspiration, the, earliest, such, composer, was, liza, lehmann, fitzgerald, rendered, khayyam, s, name, as, tentmaker, and, the, anglicized, name, of, omar, the, tentmaker, resonated, in, english, speaking, popular, culture, for, a, while, thus, nathan, haskell, dole, published, a, novel, called, omar, the, tentmaker, a, romance, of, old, persia, in, 1898, omar, the, tentmaker, of, naishapur, is, a, historical, novel, by, john, smith, clarke, published, in, 1910, omar, the, tentmaker, is, also, the, title, of, a, 1914, play, by, richard, walton, tully, in, an, oriental, setting, adapted, as, a, silent, film, in, 1922, us, general, omar, bradley, was, given, the, nickname, omar, the, tent, maker, in, world, war, ii, 13, the, diverse, talents, and, intellectual, pursuits, of, khayyam, captivated, many, ottoman, and, turkish, writers, throughout, history, scholars, often, viewed, khayyam, as, a, means, to, enhance, their, own, poetic, prowess, and, intellectual, depth, drawing, inspiration, and, recognition, from, his, writings, for, many, muslim, reformers, khayam, s, verses, provided, a, counterpoint, to, the, conservative, norms, prevalent, in, islamic, societies, allowing, room, for, independent, thought, and, a, libertine, lifestyle, figures, like, abdullah, cevdet, r, za, tevfik, and, yahya, kemal, utilized, khayyam, s, themes, to, justify, their, progressive, ideologies, or, to, celebrate, liberal, aspects, of, their, lives, portraying, him, as, a, cultural, political, and, intellectual, role, model, who, demonstrated, islam, s, compatibility, with, modern, conventions, similarly, turkish, leftist, poets, and, intellectuals, including, n, z, m, hikmet, sabahattin, ey, bo, lu, a, kadir, and, g, k, e, appropriated, khayyam, to, champion, their, socialist, worldview, imbuing, his, voice, with, a, humanistic, tone, in, the, vernacular, khayyam, s, resurgence, in, spoken, turkish, since, the, 1980s, has, transformed, him, into, a, poet, of, the, people, with, numerous, books, and, translations, revitalizing, his, historical, significance, conversely, scholars, like, d, ni, tevfik, and, g, lp, narl, advocated, for, source, criticism, and, the, identification, of, authentic, quatrains, to, discern, the, genuine, khayyam, amidst, historical, perceptions, of, his, sociocultural, image, the, quatrain, by, omar, khayyam, known, as, the, moving, finger, in, the, form, of, its, translation, by, the, english, poet, edward, fitzgerald, is, one, of, the, most,
