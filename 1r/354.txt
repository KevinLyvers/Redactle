considered, by, many, to, be, the, central, representative, of, romanticism, in, russian, literature, although, he, was, not, unequivocally, known, as, a, romantic, russian, critics, have, traditionally, argued, that, his, works, represent, a, path, from, neoclassicism, through, romanticism, to, realism, an, alternative, assessment, suggests, that, he, had, an, ability, to, entertain, contrarities, which, may, seem, romantic, in, origin, but, are, ultimately, subversive, of, all, fixed, points, of, view, all, single, outlooks, including, the, romantic, and, that, he, is, simultaneously, romantic, and, not, romantic, pushkin, is, usually, credited, with, developing, russian, literature, he, is, seen, as, having, originated, the, highly, nuanced, level, of, language, which, characterizes, russian, literature, after, him, and, he, is, also, credited, with, substantially, augmenting, the, russian, lexicon, whenever, he, found, gaps, in, the, russian, vocabulary, he, devised, calques, his, rich, vocabulary, and, highly, sensitive, style, are, the, foundation, for, modern, russian, literature, his, accomplishments, set, new, records, for, development, of, the,

literary, process, of, the, 19th, century, he, introduced, russia, to, all, the, european, literary, genres, as, well, as, a, great, number, of, west, european, writers, he, brought, natural, speech, and, foreign, influences, to, create, modern, poetic, russian, though, his, life, was, brief, he, left, examples, of, nearly, every, literary, genre, of, his, day, lyric, poetry, narrative, poetry, the, novel, the, short, story, the, drama, the, critical, essay, and, even, the, personal, letter, according, to, vladimir, nabokov, pushkin, s, idiom, combined, all, the, contemporaneous, elements, of, russian, with, all, he, had, learned, from, derzhavin, zhukovsky, batyushkov, karamzin, and, krylov, his, work, as, a, critic, and, as, a, journalist, marked, the, birth, of, russian, magazine, culture, which, included, him, devising, and, contributing, heavily, to, one, of, the, most, influential, literary, magazines, of, the, 19th, century, the, sovremennik, the, contemporary, or, pushkin, inspired, the, folk, tales, and, genre, pieces, of, other, authors, leskov, yesenin, and, gorky, his, use, of, russian, formed, the, basis, of, the, style, of, novelists, ivan, turgenev, ivan, goncharov, and, leo, tolstoy, as, well, as, that, of, subsequent, lyric, poets, such, as, mikhail, lermontov, pushkin, was, analysed, by, nikolai, gogol, his, successor, and, pupil, and, the, great, russian, critic, vissarion, belinsky, who, produced, the, fullest, and, deepest, critical, study, of, pushkin, s, work, which, still, retains, much, of, its, relevance, in, the, centennial, year, of, pushkin, s, death, a, mass, renaming, of, existing, streets, in, his, honour, occurred, in, the, entire, soviet, union, prior, to, 2022, pushkin, was, the, third, most, common, historical, figure, represented, in, ukraine, s, streetscapes, but, his, monuments, were, removed, and, streets, that, were, named, in, his, honour, have, been, renamed, as, a, result, of, the, russian, invasion, of, ukraine, these, pushkin, monuments, and, any, toponymy, named, after, him, are, now, illegal, in, ukraine, because, according, to, the, law, that, forbids, their, existence, they, are, dedicated, to,
