shot, a, hitchcock, film, is, an, organism, with, the, whole, implied, in, every, detail, and, every, detail, related, to, the, whole, hitchcock, s, film, production, career, evolved, from, small, scale, silent, films, to, financially, significant, sound, films, hitchcock, remarked, that, he, was, influenced, by, early, filmmakers, george, m, li, s, d, w, griffith, and, alice, guy, blach, his, silent, films, between, 1925, and, 1929, were, in, the, crime, and, suspense, genres, but, also, included, melodramas, and, comedies, whilst, visual, storytelling, was, pertinent, during, the, silent, era, even, after, the, arrival, of, sound, hitchcock, still, relied, on, visuals, in, cinema, he, referred, to, this, emphasis, on, visual, storytelling, as, pure, cinema, in, britain, he, honed, his, craft, so, that, by, the, time, he, moved, to, hollywood, the, director, had, perfected, his, style, and, camera, techniques, hitchcock, later, said, that, his, british, work, was, the, sensation, of,

reviewers, criticised, hitchcock, s, films, for, being, unoriginal, and, conceited, raymond, durgnat, opined, that, hitchcock, s, films, were, carefully, and, intelligently, constructed, but, thought, they, can, be, shallow, and, rarely, present, a, coherent, worldview, earning, the, title, master, of, suspense, the, director, experimented, with, ways, to, generate, tension, in, his, work, he,

during, filming, of, north, by, northwest, hitchcock, explained, his, reasons, for, recreating, the, set, of, mount, rushmore, the, audience, responds, in, proportion, to, how, realistic, you, make, it, one, of, the, dramatic, reasons, for, this, type, of, photography, is, to, get, it, looking, so, natural, that, the, audience, gets, involved, and, believes, for, the, time, being, what, s, going, on, up, there, on, the, screen, in, a, 1963, interview, with, italian, journalist, oriana, fallaci, hitchcock, was, asked, how, in, spite, of, appearing, to, be, a, pleasant, innocuous, man, he, seemed, to, enjoy, making, films, involving, suspense, and, terrifying, crime, he, responded, i, m, english, the, english, use, a, lot, of, imagination, with, their, crimes, i, don, t, get, such, a, kick, out, of, anything, as, much, as, out, of, imagining, a, crime, when, i, m, writing, a, story, and, i, come, to, a, crime, i, think, happily, now, wouldn, t, it, be, nice, to, have, him, die, like, this, and, then, even, more, happily, i, think, at, this, point, people, will, start, yelling, it, must, be, because, i, spent, three, years, studying, with, the, jesuits, they, used, to, terrify, me, to, death, with, everything, and, now, i, m, getting, my, own, back, by, terrifying, other, people, hitchcock, s, films, from, the, silent, to, the, sound, era, contained, a, number, of, recurring, themes, that, he, is, famous, for, his, films, explored, audience, as, a, voyeur, notably, in, rear, window, marnie, and, psycho, he, understood, that, human, beings, enjoy, voyeuristic,

innocent, protagonist, is, accused, of, a, crime, and, is, pursued, by, police, in, most, cases, it, is, an, ordinary, everyday, person, who, finds, themselves, in, a, dangerous, situation, hitchcock, told, truffaut, that, s, because, the, theme, of, the, innocent, man, being, accused, i, feel, provides, the, audience, with, a, greater, sense, of, danger, it, s, easier, for, them, to, identify, with, him, than, with, a, guilty, man, on, the, run, one, of, his, constant, themes, was, the, struggle, of, a, personality, torn, between, order, and, chaos, known, as, the, notion, of, double, which, is, a, comparison, or, contrast, between, two, characters, or, objects, the, double, representing, a, dark, or, evil, side, according, to, robin, wood, hitchcock, retained, a, feeling, of, ambivalence, towards, homosexuality, despite, working, with, gay, actors, throughout, his, career, donald, spoto, suggests, that, hitchcock, s, sexually, repressive, childhood, may, have, contributed, to, his, exploration, of, deviancy, during, the, 1950s, the, motion, picture, production, code, prohibited, direct, references, to, homosexuality, but, the, director, was, known, for, his, subtle, references, and, pushing, the, boundaries, of, the, censors, moreover, shadow, of, a, doubt, has, a, double, incest, theme, through, the, storyline, expressed, implicitly, through, images, author, jane, sloan, argues, that, hitchcock, was, drawn, to, both, conventional, and, unconventional, sexual, expression, in, his, work, and, the, theme, of, marriage, was, usually, presented, in, a, bleak, and, skeptical, manner, it, was, also, not, until, after, his, mother, s, death, in, 1942, that, hitchcock, portrayed, motherly, figures, as, notorious, monster, mothers, the, espionage, backdrop, and, murders, committed, by, characters, with, psychopathic, tendencies, were, common, themes, too, in, hitchcock, s, depiction, of, villains, and, murderers, they, were, usually, charming, and, friendly, forcing, viewers, to, identify, with, them, the, director, s, strict, childhood, and, jesuit, education, may, have, led, to, his, distrust, of, authority, figures, such, as, policemen, and, politicians, a, theme, which, he, has, explored, also, he, used, the, macguffin, the, use, of, an, object, person, or, event, to, keep, the, plot, moving, along, even, if, it, was, non, essential, to, the, story, hitchcock, appears, briefly, in, most, of, his, own, films, for, example, he, is, seen, struggling, to, get, a, double, bass, onto, a, train, strangers, on, a, train, walking, dogs, out, of, a, pet, shop, the, birds, fixing, a, neighbour, s, clock, rear, window, as, a, shadow, family, plot, sitting, at, a, table, in, a, photograph, dial, m, for, murder, and, riding, a, bus, north, by,

mulvey, introduced, the, idea, of, the, male, gaze, the, view, of, the, spectator, in, hitchcock, s, films, she, argued, is, that, of, the, heterosexual, male, protagonist, the, female, characters, in, his, films, reflected, the, same, qualities, over, and, over, again, roger, ebert, wrote, in, 1996, they, were, blonde, they, were, icy, and, remote, they, were, imprisoned, in, costumes, that,

of, control, you, get, the, range, whether, you, do, little, acting, a, lot, of, acting, in, a, given, scene, you, know, exactly, where, you, re, going, and, these, were, the, first, things, that, she, had, to, know, emotion, comes, later, and, the, control, of, the, voice, comes, later, but, within, herself, she, had, to, learn, authority, first, and, foremost, because, out, of, authority,

lombard, brought, three, cows, onto, the, set, wearing, the, name, tags, of, lombard, robert, montgomery, and, gene, raymond, the, stars, of, the, film, to, surprise, him, in, an, episode, of, the, dick, cavett, show, originally, broadcast, on, 8, june, 1972, dick, cavett, stated, as, fact, that, hitchcock, had, once, called, actors, cattle, hitchcock, responded, by, saying, that, at, one, time, he, had, been, accused, of, calling, actors, cattle, i, said, that, i, would, never, say, such, an, unfeeling, rude, thing, about, actors, at, all, what, i, probably, said, was, that, all, actors, should, be, treated, like, cattle, in, a, nice, way, of, course, he, then, described, carole, lombard, s, joke, with, a, smile, hitchcock, believed, that, actors, should, concentrate, on, their, performances, and, leave, work, on, script, and, character, to, the, directors, and, screenwriters, he, told, bryan, forbes, in, 1967, i, remember, discussing, with, a, method, actor, how, he, was, taught, and, so, forth, he, said, we, re, taught, using, improvisation, we, are, given, an, idea, and, then, we, are, turned, loose, to, develop, in, any, way, we, want, to, i, said, that, s, not, acting, that, s, writing, recalling, their, experiences, on, lifeboat, for, charles, chandler, author, of, it, s, only, a, movie, alfred, hitchcock, a, personal, biography, walter, slezak, said, that, hitchcock, knew, more, about, how, to, help, an, actor, than, any, director, i, ever, worked, with, and, hume, cronyn, dismissed, the, idea, that, hitchcock, was, not, concerned, with, his, actors, as, utterly, fallacious, describing, at, length, the, process, of, rehearsing, and, filming, lifeboat, critics, observed, that, despite, his, reputation, as, a, man, who, disliked, actors, actors, who, worked, with, him, often, gave, brilliant, performances, he, used, the, same, actors, in, many, of, his, films, cary, grant, and, james, stewart, both, worked, with, hitchcock, four, times, and, ingrid, bergman, and, grace, kelly, three, james, mason, said, that, hitchcock, regarded, actors, as, animated, props, for, hitchcock, the, actors, were, part, of, the, film, s, setting, he, told, fran, ois, truffaut, the, chief, requisite, for, an, actor, is, the, ability, to, do, nothing, well, which, is, by, no, means, as, easy, as, it, sounds, he, should, be, willing, to, be, used, and, wholly, integrated, into, the, picture, by, the, director, and, the, camera, he, must, allow, the, camera, to, determine, the, proper, emphasis, and, the, most, effective, dramatic, highlights, hitchcock, planned, his, scripts, in, detail, with, his, writers, in, writing, with, hitchcock, 2001, steven, derosa, noted, that, hitchcock, supervised, them, through, every, draft, asking, that, they, tell, the, story, visually, hitchcock, told, roger, ebert, in, 1969, once, the, screenplay, is, finished, i, d, just, as, soon, not, make, the, film, at, all, all, the, fun, is, over, i, have, a, strongly, visual, mind, i, visualize, a, picture, right, down, to, the, final, cuts, i, write, all, this, out, in, the, greatest, detail, in, the, script, and, then, i, don, t, look, at, the, script, while, i, m, shooting, i, know, it, off, by, heart, just, as, an, orchestra, conductor, needs, not, look, at, the, score, it, s, melancholy, to, shoot, a, picture, when, you, finish, the, script, the, film, is, perfect, but, in, shooting, it, you, lose, perhaps, 40, per, cent, of, your, original, conception, hitchcock, s, films, were, extensively, storyboarded, to, the, finest, detail, he, was, reported, to, have, never, even, bothered, looking, through, the, viewfinder, since, he, did, not, need, to, although, in, publicity, photos, he, was, shown, doing, so, he, also, used, this, as, an, excuse, to, never, have, to, change, his, films, from, his, initial, vision, if, a, studio, asked, him, to, change, a, film, he, would, claim, that, it, was, already, shot, in, a, single, way, and, that, there, were, no, alternative, takes, to, consider, this, view, of, hitchcock, as, a, director, who, relied, more, on, pre, production, than, on, the, actual, production, itself, has, been, challenged, by, bill, krohn, the, american, correspondent, of, french, film, magazine, cahiers, du, cin, ma, in, his, book, hitchcock, at, work, after, investigating, script, revisions, notes, to, other, production, personnel, written, by, or, to, hitchcock, and, other, production, material, krohn, observed, that, hitchcock, s, work, often, deviated, from, how, the, screenplay, was, written, or, how, the, film, was, originally, envisioned, he, noted, that, the, myth, of, storyboards, in, relation, to, hitchcock, often, regurgitated, by, generations, of, commentators, on, his, films, was, to, a, great, degree, perpetuated, by, hitchcock, himself, or, the, publicity, arm, of, the, studios, for, example, the, celebrated, crop, spraying, sequence, of, north, by, northwest, was, not, storyboarded, at, all, after, the, scene, was, filmed, the, publicity, department, asked, hitchcock, to, make, storyboards, to, promote, the, film, and, hitchcock, in, turn, hired, an, artist, to, match, the, scenes, in, detail, even, when, storyboards, were, made, scenes, that, were, shot, differed, from, them, significantly, krohn, s, analysis, of, the, production, of, hitchcock, classics, like, notorious, reveals, that, hitchcock, was, flexible, enough, to, change, a, film, s, conception, during, its, production, another, example, krohn, notes, is, the, american, remake, of, the, man, who, knew, too, much, whose, shooting, schedule, commenced, without, a, finished, script, and, moreover, went, over, schedule, something, that, as, krohn, notes, was, not, an, uncommon, occurrence, on, many, of, hitchcock, s, films, including, strangers, on, a, train, and, topaz, while, hitchcock, did, do, a, great, deal, of, preparation, for, all, his, films, he, was, fully, cognisant, that, the, actual, film, making, process, often, deviated, from, the, best, laid, plans, and, was, flexible, to, adapt, to, the, changes, and, needs, of, production, as, his, films, were, not, free, from, the, normal, hassles, faced, and, common, routines, used, during, many, other, film, productions, krohn, s, work, also, sheds, light, on, hitchcock, s, practice, of, generally, shooting, in, chronological, order, which, he, notes, sent, many, films, over, budget, and, over, schedule, and, more, importantly, differed, from, the, standard, operating, procedure, of, hollywood, in, the, studio, system, era, equally, important, is, hitchcock, s, tendency, to, shoot, alternative, takes, of, scenes, this, differed, from, coverage, in, that, the, films, were, not, necessarily, shot, from, varying, angles, so, as, to, give, the, editor, options, to, shape, the, film, how, they, chose, often, under, the, producer, s, aegis, rather, they, represented, hitchcock, s, tendency, to, give, himself, options, in, the, editing, room, where, he, would, provide, advice, to, his, editors, after, viewing, a, rough, cut, of, the, work, according, to, krohn, this, and, a, great, deal, of, other, information, revealed, through, his, research, of, hitchcock, s, personal, papers, script, revisions, and, the, like, refute, the, notion, of, hitchcock, as, a, director, who, was, always, in, control, of, his, films, whose, vision, of, his, films, did, not, change, during, production, which, krohn, notes, has, remained, the, central, long, standing, myth, of, alfred, hitchcock, both, his, fastidiousness, and, attention, to, detail, also, found, their, way, into, each, film, poster, for, his, films, hitchcock, preferred, to, work, with, the, best, talent, of, his, day, film, poster, designers, such, as, bill, gold, and, saul, bass, who, would, produce, posters, that, accurately, represented, his, films, hitchcock, was, inducted, into, the, hollywood, walk, of, fame, on, 8,
