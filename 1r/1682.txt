antoine, laurent, de, lavoisier, l, v, w, z, i, e, l, vwah, zee, ay, french, 26, august, 1743, 8, may, 1794, also, antoine, lavoisier, after, the, french, revolution, was, a, french, nobleman, and, chemist, who, was, central, to, the, 18th, century, chemical, revolution, and, who, had, a, large, influence, on, both, the, history, of, chemistry, and, the, history, of, biology, it, is, generally, accepted, that, lavoisier, s, great, accomplishments, in, chemistry, stem, largely, from, his, changing, the, science, from, a, qualitative, to, a, quantitative, one, lavoisier, is, most, noted, for, his, discovery, of, the, role, oxygen, plays, in, combustion, he, named, oxygen, 1778, recognizing, it, as, an, element, and, also, recognized, hydrogen, as, an, element, 1783, opposing, the, phlogiston, theory, lavoisier, helped, construct, the, metric, system, wrote, the, first, extensive, list, of, elements, and, helped, to, reform, chemical, nomenclature, he, predicted, the, existence, of, silicon, 1787, and, discovered, that, although, matter, may, change, its, form, or, shape, its, mass, always, remains, the, same, his, wife, and, laboratory, assistant, marie, anne, paulze, lavoisier, became, a, renowned, chemist, in, her, own, right, lavoisier, was, a, powerful, member, of, a, number, of, aristocratic, councils, and, an, administrator, of, the, ferme, g, n, rale, the, ferme, g, n, rale, was, one, of, the, most, hated, components, of, the, ancien, r, gime, because, of, the, profits, it, took, at, the, expense, of, the, state, the, secrecy, of, the, terms, of, its, contracts, and, the, violence, of, its, armed, agents, all, of, these, political, and, economic, activities, enabled, him, to, fund, his, scientific, research, at, the, height, of, the, french, revolution, he, was, charged, with, tax, fraud, and, selling, adulterated, tobacco, and, was, guillotined, despite, appeals, to, spare, his, life, in, recognition, of, his, contributions, to, science, a, year, and, a, half, later, he, was, exonerated, by, the, french, government, antoine, laurent, lavoisier, was, born, to, a, wealthy, family, of, the, nobility, in, paris, on, 26, august, 1743, the, son, of, an, attorney, at, the, parlement, of, paris, he, inherited, a, large, fortune, at, the, age, of, five, upon, the, death, of, his, mother, lavoisier, began, his, schooling, at, the, coll, ge, des, quatre, nations, university, of, paris, also, known, as, the, coll, ge, mazarin, in, paris, in, 1754, at, the, age, of, 11, in, his, last, two, years, 1760, 1761, at, the, school, his, scientific, interests, were, aroused, and, he, studied, chemistry, botany, astronomy, and, mathematics, in, the, philosophy, class, he, came, under, the, tutelage, of, abb, nicolas, louis, de, lacaille, a, distinguished, mathematician, and, observational, astronomer, who, imbued, the, young, lavoisier, with, an, interest, in, meteorological, observation, an, enthusiasm, which, never, left, him, lavoisier, entered, the, school, of, law, where, he, received, a, bachelor, s, degree, in, 1763, and, a, licentiate, in, 1764, lavoisier, received, a, law, degree, and, was, admitted, to, the, bar, but, never, practiced, as, a, lawyer, however, he, continued, his, scientific, education, in, his, spare, time, lavoisier, s, education, was, filled, with, the, ideals, of, the, french, enlightenment, of, the, time, and, he, was, fascinated, by, pierre, macquer, s, dictionary, of, chemistry, he, attended, lectures, in, the, natural, sciences, lavoisier, s, devotion, and, passion, for, chemistry, were, largely, influenced, by, tienne, condillac, a, prominent, french, scholar, of, the, 18th, century, his, first, chemical, publication, appeared, in, 1764, from, 1763, to, 1767, he, studied, geology, under, jean, tienne, guettard, in, collaboration, with, guettard, lavoisier, worked, on, a, geological, survey, of, alsace, lorraine, in, june, 1767, in, 1764, he, read, his, first, paper, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, france, s, most, elite, scientific, society, on, the, chemical, and, physical, properties, of, gypsum, hydrated, calcium, sulfate, and, in, 1766, he, was, awarded, a, gold, medal, by, the, king, for, an, essay, on, the, problems, of, urban, street, lighting, in, 1768, lavoisier, received, a, provisional, appointment, to, the, academy, of, sciences, in, 1769, he, worked, on, the, first, geological, map, of, france, while, lavoisier, is, commonly, known, for, his, contributions, to, the, sciences, he, also, dedicated, a, significant, portion, of, his, fortune, and, work, toward, benefitting, the, public, lavoisier, was, a, humanitarian, he, cared, deeply, about, the, people, in, his, country, and, often, concerned, himself, with, improving, the, livelihood, of, the, population, by, agriculture, industry, and, the, sciences, the, first, instance, of, this, occurred, in, 1765, when, he, submitted, an, essay, on, improving, urban, street, lighting, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, three, years, later, in, 1768, he, focused, on, a, new, project, to, design, an, aqueduct, the, goal, was, to, bring, water, from, the, river, yvette, into, paris, so, that, the, citizens, could, have, clean, drinking, water, but, since, the, construction, never, commenced, he, instead, turned, his, focus, to, purifying, the, water, from, the, seine, this, was, the, project, that, interested, lavoisier, in, the, chemistry, of, water, and, public, sanitation, duties, additionally, he, was, interested, in, air, quality, and, spent, some, time, studying, the, health, risks, associated, with, gunpowder, s, effect, on, the, air, in, 1772, he, performed, a, study, on, how, to, reconstruct, the, h, tel, dieu, hospital, after, it, had, been, damaged, by, fire, in, a, way, that, would, allow, proper, ventilation, and, clean, air, throughout, at, the, time, the, prisons, in, paris, were, known, to, be, largely, unlivable, and, the, prisoners, treatment, inhumane, lavoisier, took, part, in, investigations, in, 1780, and, again, in, 1791, on, the, hygiene, in, prisons, and, had, made, suggestions, to, improve, living, conditions, suggestions, which, were, largely, ignored, once, a, part, of, the, academy, lavoisier, also, held, his, own, competitions, to, push, the, direction, of, research, towards, bettering, the, public, and, his, own, work, lavoisier, had, a, vision, of, public, education, having, roots, in, scientific, sociability, and, philanthropy, lavoisier, gained, a, vast, majority, of, his, income, through, buying, stock, in, the, general, farm, which, allowed, him, to, work, on, science, full, time, live, comfortably, and, allowed, him, to, contribute, financially, to, better, the, community, it, would, also, contribute, to, his, demise, during, the, reign, of, terror, many, years, later, it, was, very, difficult, to, secure, public, funding, for, the, sciences, at, the, time, and, additionally, not, very, financially, profitable, for, the, average, scientist, so, lavoisier, used, his, wealth, to, open, a, very, expensive, and, sophisticated, laboratory, in, france, so, that, aspiring, scientists, could, study, without, the, barriers, of, securing, funding, for, their, research, he, also, pushed, for, public, education, in, the, sciences, he, founded, two, organizations, lyc, e, and, mus, e, des, arts, et, m, tiers, which, were, created, to, serve, as, educational, tools, for, the, public, funded, by, the, wealthy, and, noble, the, lyc, e, regularly, taught, courses, to, the, public, beginning, in, 1793, at, the, age, of, 26, around, the, time, he, was, elected, to, the, academy, of, sciences, lavoisier, bought, a, share, in, the, ferme, g, n, rale, a, tax, farming, financial, company, which, advanced, the, estimated, tax, revenue, to, the, royal, government, in, return, for, the, right, to, collect, the, taxes, on, behalf, of, the, ferme, g, n, rale, lavoisier, commissioned, the, building, of, a, wall, around, paris, so, that, customs, duties, could, be, collected, from, those, transporting, goods, into, and, out, of, the, city, his, participation, in, the, collection, of, its, taxes, did, not, help, his, reputation, when, the, reign, of, terror, began, in, france, as, taxes, and, poor, government, reform, were, the, primary, motivators, during, the, french, revolution, lavoisier, consolidated, his, social, and, economic, position, when, in, 1771, at, age, 28, he, married, marie, anne, pierrette, paulze, the, 13, year, old, daughter, of, a, senior, member, of, the, ferme, g, n, rale, she, was, to, play, an, important, part, in, lavoisier, s, scientific, career, notably, she, translated, english, documents, for, him, including, richard, kirwan, s, essay, on, phlogiston, and, joseph, priestley, s, research, in, addition, she, assisted, him, in, the, laboratory, and, created, many, sketches, and, carved, engravings, of, the, laboratory, instruments, used, by, lavoisier, and, his, colleagues, for, their, scientific, works, madame, lavoisier, edited, and, published, antoine, s, memoirs, whether, any, english, translations, of, those, memoirs, have, survived, is, unknown, as, of, today, and, hosted, parties, at, which, eminent, scientists, discussed, ideas, and, problems, related, to, chemistry, a, portrait, of, antoine, and, marie, anne, lavoisier, was, painted, by, the, famed, artist, jacques, louis, david, completed, in, 1788, on, the, eve, of, the, revolution, the, painting, was, denied, a, customary, public, display, at, the, paris, salon, for, fear, that, it, might, inflame, anti, aristocratic, passions, for, three, years, following, his, entry, into, the, ferme, g, n, rale, lavoisier, s, scientific, activity, diminished, somewhat, for, much, of, his, time, was, taken, up, with, official, ferme, g, n, rale, business, he, did, however, present, one, important, memoir, to, the, academy, of, sciences, during, this, period, on, the, supposed, conversion, of, water, into, earth, by, evaporation, by, a, very, precise, quantitative, experiment, lavoisier, showed, that, the, earthy, sediment, produced, after, long, continued, reflux, heating, of, water, in, a, glass, vessel, was, not, due, to, a, conversion, of, the, water, into, earth, but, rather, to, the, gradual, disintegration, of, the, inside, of, the, glass, vessel, produced, by, the, boiling, water, he, also, attempted, to, introduce, reforms, in, the, french, monetary, and, taxation, system, to, help, the, peasants, the, farmers, general, held, a, monopoly, of, the, production, import, and, sale, of, tobacco, in, france, and, the, taxes, they, levied, on, tobacco, brought, revenues, of, 30, million, livres, a, year, this, revenue, began, to, fall, because, of, a, growing, black, market, in, tobacco, that, was, smuggled, and, adulterated, most, commonly, with, ash, and, water, lavoisier, devised, a, method, of, checking, whether, ash, had, been, mixed, in, with, tobacco, when, a, spirit, of, vitriol, aqua, fortis, or, some, other, acid, solution, is, poured, on, ash, there, is, an, immediate, very, intense, effervescent, reaction, accompanied, by, an, easily, detected, noise, lavoisier, also, noticed, that, the, addition, of, a, small, amount, of, ash, improved, the, flavour, of, tobacco, of, one, vendor, selling, adulterated, goods, he, wrote, his, tobacco, enjoys, a, very, good, reputation, in, the, province, the, very, small, proportion, of, ash, that, is, added, gives, it, a, particularly, pungent, flavour, that, consumers, look, for, perhaps, the, farm, could, gain, some, advantage, by, adding, a, bit, of, this, liquid, mixture, when, the, tobacco, is, fabricated, lavoisier, also, found, that, while, adding, a, lot, of, water, to, bulk, the, tobacco, up, would, cause, it, to, ferment, and, smell, bad, the, addition, of, a, very, small, amount, improved, the, product, thereafter, the, factories, of, the, farmers, general, added, as, he, recommended, a, consistent, 6, 3, of, water, by, volume, to, the, tobacco, they, processed, to, allow, for, this, addition, the, farmers, general, delivered, to, retailers, seventeen, ounces, of, tobacco, while, only, charging, for, sixteen, to, ensure, that, only, these, authorised, amounts, were, added, and, to, exclude, the, black, market, lavoisier, saw, to, it, that, a, watertight, system, of, checks, accounts, supervision, and, testing, made, it, very, difficult, for, retailers, to, source, contraband, tobacco, or, to, improve, their, profits, by, bulking, it, up, he, was, energetic, and, rigorous, in, implementing, this, and, the, systems, he, introduced, were, deeply, unpopular, with, the, tobacco, retailers, across, the, country, this, unpopularity, was, to, have, consequences, for, him, during, the, french, revolution, lavoisier, urged, the, establishment, of, a, royal, commission, on, agriculture, he, then, served, as, its, secretary, and, spent, considerable, sums, of, his, own, money, in, order, to, improve, the, agricultural, yields, in, the, sologne, an, area, where, farmland, was, of, poor, quality, the, humidity, of, the, region, often, led, to, a, blight, of, the, rye, harvest, causing, outbreaks, of, ergotism, among, the, population, in, 1788, lavoisier, presented, a, report, to, the, commission, detailing, ten, years, of, efforts, on, his, experimental, farm, to, introduce, new, crops, and, types, of, livestock, his, conclusion, was, that, despite, the, possibilities, of, agricultural, reforms, the, tax, system, left, tenant, farmers, with, so, little, that, it, was, unrealistic, to, expect, them, to, change, their, traditional, practices, lavoisier, s, researches, on, combustion, were, carried, out, in, the, midst, of, a, very, busy, schedule, of, public, and, private, duties, especially, in, connection, with, the, ferme, g, n, rale, there, were, also, innumerable, reports, for, and, committees, of, the, academy, of, sciences, to, investigate, specific, problems, on, order, of, the, royal, government, lavoisier, whose, organizing, skills, were, outstanding, frequently, landed, the, task, of, writing, up, such, official, reports, in, 1775, he, was, made, one, of, four, commissioners, of, gunpowder, appointed, to, replace, a, private, company, similar, to, the, ferme, g, n, rale, which, had, proved, unsatisfactory, in, supplying, france, with, its, munitions, requirements, as, a, result, of, his, efforts, both, the, quantity, and, quality, of, french, gunpowder, greatly, improved, and, it, became, a, source, of, revenue, for, the, government, his, appointment, to, the, gunpowder, commission, brought, one, great, benefit, to, lavoisier, s, scientific, career, as, well, as, a, commissioner, he, enjoyed, both, a, house, and, a, laboratory, in, the, royal, arsenal, here, he, lived, and, worked, between, 1775, and, 1792, lavoisier, was, a, formative, influence, in, the, formation, of, the, du, pont, gunpowder, business, because, he, trained, leuth, re, ir, n, e, du, pont, its, founder, on, gunpowder, making, in, france, the, latter, said, that, the, du, pont, gunpowder, mills, would, never, have, been, started, but, for, his, kindness, to, me, 40, in, june, 1791, lavoisier, made, a, loan, of, 71, 000, livres, to, pierre, samuel, du, pont, de, nemours, to, buy, a, printing, works, so, that, du, pont, could, publish, a, newspaper, la, correspondance, patriotique, the, plan, was, for, this, to, include, both, reports, of, debates, in, the, national, constituent, assembly, as, well, as, papers, from, the, academy, of, sciences, the, revolution, quickly, disrupted, the, elder, du, pont, s, first, newspaper, but, his, son, e, i, du, pont, soon, launched, le, republicain, and, published, lavoisier, s, latest, chemistry, texts, 15, lavoisier, also, chaired, the, commission, set, up, to, establish, a, uniform, system, of, weights, and, measures, which, in, march, 1791, recommended, the, adoption, of, the, metric, system, the, new, system, of, weights, and, measures, was, adopted, by, the, convention, on, 1, august, 1793, lavoisier, was, one, of, the, 27, farmers, general, who, by, order, of, the, convention, were, all, to, be, detained, although, temporarily, going, into, hiding, on, 30, november, 1793, he, handed, himself, into, the, port, royal, convent, for, questioning, he, claimed, he, had, not, operated, on, this, commission, for, many, years, having, instead, devoted, himself, to, science, lavoisier, himself, was, removed, from, the, commission, on, weights, and, measures, on, 23, december, 1793, together, with, mathematician, pierre, simon, laplace, and, several, other, members, for, political, reasons, one, of, his, last, major, works, was, a, proposal, to, the, national, convention, for, the, reform, of, french, education, he, also, intervened, on, behalf, of, a, number, of, foreign, born, scientists, including, mathematician, joseph, louis, lagrange, helping, to, exempt, them, from, a, mandate, stripping, all, foreigners, of, possessions, and, freedom, as, the, french, revolution, gained, momentum, attacks, mounted, on, the, deeply, unpopular, ferme, g, n, rale, and, it, was, eventually, abolished, in, march, 1791, in, 1792, lavoisier, was, forced, to, resign, from, his, post, on, the, gunpowder, commission, and, to, move, from, his, house, and, laboratory, at, the, royal, arsenal, on, 8, august, 1793, all, the, learned, societies, including, the, academy, of, sciences, were, suppressed, at, the, request, of, abb, gr, goire, on, 24, november, 1793, the, arrest, of, all, the, former, tax, farmers, was, ordered, lavoisier, and, the, other, farmers, general, faced, nine, accusations, of, defrauding, the, state, of, money, owed, to, it, and, of, adding, water, to, tobacco, before, selling, it, lavoisier, drafted, their, defense, refuting, the, financial, accusations, reminding, the, court, of, how, they, had, maintained, a, consistently, high, quality, of, tobacco, the, court, however, was, inclined, to, believe, that, by, condemning, them, and, seizing, the, goods, of, the, farmers, general, it, would, recover, huge, sums, for, the, state, lavoisier, was, convicted, and, guillotined, on, 8, may, 1794, in, paris, at, the, age, of, 50, along, with, his, 27, co, defendants, according, to, popular, legend, the, appeal, to, spare, his, life, in, order, that, he, could, continue, his, experiments, was, cut, short, by, the, judge, coffinhal, la, r, publique, n, a, pas, besoin, de, savants, ni, de, chimistes, le, cours, de, la, justice, ne, peut, tre, suspendu, the, republic, needs, neither, scholars, nor, chemists, the, course, of, justice, cannot, be, delayed, the, judge, coffinhal, himself, would, be, executed, less, than, three, months, later, in, the, wake, of, the, thermidorian, reaction, lavoisier, s, importance, to, science, was, expressed, by, lagrange, who, lamented, the, beheading, by, saying, il, ne, leur, a, fallu, qu, un, moment, pour, faire, tomber, cette, t, te, et, cent, ann, es, peut, tre, ne, suffiront, pas, pour, en, reproduire, une, semblable, it, took, them, only, an, instant, to, cut, off, this, head, and, one, hundred, years, might, not, suffice, to, reproduce, its, like, a, year, and, a, half, after, his, execution, lavoisier, was, completely, exonerated, by, the, french, government, during, the, white, terror, his, belongings, were, delivered, to, his, widow, a, brief, note, was, included, reading, to, the, widow, of, lavoisier, who, was, falsely, convicted, an, apocryphal, story, exists, regarding, lavoisier, s, execution, in, which, the, scientist, blinked, his, eyes, to, demonstrate, that, the, head, retained, some, consciousness, after, being, severed, some, variants, of, the, story, include, joseph, louis, lagrange, as, being, the, scientist, to, observe, and, record, lavoisier, s, blinking, this, story, was, not, recorded, in, contemporary, accounts, of, lavoisier, s, death, and, the, execution, site, was, too, removed, from, the, public, for, lagrange, to, have, viewed, lavoisier, s, alleged, experiment, the, story, likely, originated, in, a, 1990s, discovery, channel, documentary, about, guillotines, and, then, subsequently, spread, online, becoming, what, one, source, describes, as, an, urban, legend, contrary, to, prevailing, thought, at, the, time, lavoisier, theorized, that, common, air, or, one, of, its, components, combines, with, substances, when, they, are, burned, he, demonstrated, this, through, experiment, during, late, 1772, lavoisier, turned, his, attention, to, the, phenomenon, of, combustion, the, topic, on, which, he, was, to, make, his, most, significant, contribution, to, science, he, reported, the, results, of, his, first, experiments, on, combustion, in, a, note, to, the, academy, on, 20, october, in, which, he, reported, that, when, phosphorus, burned, it, combined, with, a, large, quantity, of, air, to, produce, acid, spirit, of, phosphorus, and, that, the, phosphorus, increased, in, weight, on, burning, in, a, second, sealed, note, deposited, with, the, academy, a, few, weeks, later, 1, november, lavoisier, extended, his, observations, and, conclusions, to, the, burning, of, sulfur, and, went, on, to, add, that, what, is, observed, in, the, combustion, of, sulfur, and, phosphorus, may, well, take, place, in, the, case, of, all, substances, that, gain, in, weight, by, combustion, and, calcination, and, i, am, persuaded, that, the, increase, in, weight, of, metallic, calces, is, due, to, the, same, cause, during, 1773, lavoisier, determined, to, review, thoroughly, the, literature, on, air, particularly, fixed, air, and, to, repeat, many, of, the, experiments, of, other, workers, in, the, field, he, published, an, account, of, this, review, in, 1774, in, a, book, entitled, opuscules, physiques, et, chimiques, physical, and, chemical, essays, in, the, course, of, this, review, he, made, his, first, full, study, of, the, work, of, joseph, black, the, scottish, chemist, who, had, carried, out, a, series, of, classic, quantitative, experiments, on, the, mild, and, caustic, alkalies, black, had, shown, that, the, difference, between, a, mild, alkali, for, example, chalk, caco, 3, and, the, caustic, form, for, example, quicklime, cao, lay, in, the, fact, that, the, former, contained, fixed, air, not, common, air, fixed, in, the, chalk, but, a, distinct, chemical, species, now, understood, to, be, carbon, dioxide, co, 2, which, was, a, constituent, of, the, atmosphere, lavoisier, recognized, that, black, s, fixed, air, was, identical, with, the, air, evolved, when, metal, calces, were, reduced, with, charcoal, and, even, suggested, that, the, air, which, combined, with, metals, on, calcination, and, increased, the, weight, might, be, black, s, fixed, air, that, is, co, 2, in, the, spring, of, 1774, lavoisier, carried, out, experiments, on, the, calcination, of, tin, and, lead, in, sealed, vessels, the, results, of, which, conclusively, confirmed, that, the, increase, in, weight, of, metals, in, combustion, was, due, to, combination, with, air, but, the, question, remained, about, whether, it, was, in, combination, with, common, atmospheric, air, or, with, only, a, part, of, atmospheric, air, in, october, the, english, chemist, joseph, priestley, visited, paris, where, he, met, lavoisier, and, told, him, of, the, air, which, he, had, produced, by, heating, the, red, calx, of, mercury, with, a, burning, glass, and, which, had, supported, combustion, with, extreme, vigor, priestley, at, this, time, was, unsure, of, the, nature, of, this, gas, but, he, felt, that, it, was, an, especially, pure, form, of, common, air, lavoisier, carried, out, his, own, research, on, this, peculiar, substance, the, result, was, his, memoir, on, the, nature, of, the, principle, which, combines, with, metals, during, their, calcination, and, increases, their, weight, read, to, the, academy, on, 26, april, 1775, commonly, referred, to, as, the, easter, memoir, in, the, original, memoir, lavoisier, showed, that, the, mercury, calx, was, a, true, metallic, calx, in, that, it, could, be, reduced, with, charcoal, giving, off, black, s, fixed, air, in, the, process, when, reduced, without, charcoal, it, gave, off, an, air, which, supported, respiration, and, combustion, in, an, enhanced, way, he, concluded, that, this, was, just, a, pure, form, of, common, air, and, that, it, was, the, air, itself, undivided, without, alteration, without, decomposition, which, combined, with, metals, on, calcination, after, returning, from, paris, priestley, took, up, once, again, his, investigation, of, the, air, from, mercury, calx, his, results, now, showed, that, this, air, was, not, just, an, especially, pure, form, of, common, air, but, was, five, or, six, times, better, than, common, air, for, the, purpose, of, respiration, inflammation, and, every, other, use, of, common, air, he, called, the, air, dephlogisticated, air, as, he, thought, it, was, common, air, deprived, of, its, phlogiston, since, it, was, therefore, in, a, state, to, absorb, a, much, greater, quantity, of, phlogiston, given, off, by, burning, bodies, and, respiring, animals, the, greatly, enhanced, combustion, of, substances, and, the, greater, ease, of, breathing, in, this, air, were, explained, lavoisier, s, researches, included, some, of, the, first, truly, quantitative, chemical, experiments, he, carefully, weighed, the, reactants, and, products, of, a, chemical, reaction, in, a, sealed, glass, vessel, so, that, no, gases, could, escape, which, was, a, crucial, step, in, the, advancement, of, chemistry, in, 1774, he, showed, that, although, matter, can, change, its, state, in, a, chemical, reaction, the, total, mass, of, matter, is, the, same, at, the, end, as, at, the, beginning, of, every, chemical, change, thus, for, instance, if, a, piece, of, wood, is, burned, to, ashes, the, total, mass, remains, unchanged, if, gaseous, reactants, and, products, are, included, lavoisier, s, experiments, supported, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, in, france, it, is, taught, as, lavoisier, s, law, and, is, paraphrased, from, a, statement, in, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, nothing, is, lost, nothing, is, created, everything, is, transformed, mikhail, lomonosov, 1711, 1765, had, previously, expressed, similar, ideas, in, 1748, and, proved, them, in, experiments, others, whose, ideas, pre, date, the, work, of, lavoisier, include, jean, rey, 1583, 1645, joseph, black, 1728, 1799, and, henry, cavendish, 1731, 1810, lavoisier, together, with, louis, bernard, guyton, de, morveau, claude, louis, berthollet, and, antoine, fran, ois, de, fourcroy, submitted, a, new, program, for, the, reforms, of, chemical, nomenclature, to, the, academy, in, 1787, for, there, was, virtually, no, rational, system, of, chemical, nomenclature, at, this, time, this, work, titled, m, thode, de, nomenclature, chimique, method, of, chemical, nomenclature, 1787, introduced, a, new, system, which, was, tied, inextricably, to, lavoisier, s, new, oxygen, theory, of, chemistry, the, classical, elements, of, earth, air, fire, and, water, were, discarded, and, instead, some, 33, substances, which, could, not, be, decomposed, into, simpler, substances, by, any, known, chemical, means, were, provisionally, listed, as, elements, the, elements, included, light, caloric, matter, of, heat, the, principles, of, oxygen, hydrogen, and, azote, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, the, yet, unknown, radicals, of, muriatic, acid, hydrochloric, acid, boric, acid, and, fluoric, acid, 17, metals, 5, earths, mainly, oxides, of, yet, unknown, metals, such, as, magnesia, baria, and, strontia, three, alkalies, potash, soda, and, ammonia, and, the, radicals, of, 19, organic, acids, the, acids, regarded, in, the, new, system, as, compounds, of, various, elements, with, oxygen, were, given, names, which, indicated, the, element, involved, together, with, the, degree, of, oxygenation, of, that, element, for, example, sulfuric, and, sulfurous, acids, phosphoric, and, phosphorous, acids, nitric, and, nitrous, acids, the, ic, termination, indicating, acids, with, a, higher, proportion, of, oxygen, than, those, with, the, ous, ending, similarly, salts, of, the, ic, acids, were, given, the, terminal, letters, ate, as, in, copper, sulfate, whereas, the, salts, of, the, ous, acids, terminated, with, the, suffix, ite, as, in, copper, sulfite, the, total, effect, of, the, new, nomenclature, can, be, gauged, by, comparing, the, new, name, copper, sulfate, with, the, old, term, vitriol, of, venus, lavoisier, s, new, nomenclature, spread, throughout, europe, and, to, the, united, states, and, became, common, use, in, the, field, of, chemistry, this, marked, the, beginning, of, the, anti, phlogistic, approach, to, the, field, lavoisier, is, commonly, cited, as, a, central, contributor, to, the, chemical, revolution, his, precise, measurements, and, meticulous, keeping, of, balance, sheets, throughout, his, experiment, were, vital, to, the, widespread, acceptance, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, his, introduction, of, new, terminology, a, binomial, system, modeled, after, that, of, linnaeus, also, helps, to, mark, the, dramatic, changes, in, the, field, which, are, referred, to, generally, as, the, chemical, revolution, lavoisier, encountered, much, opposition, in, trying, to, change, the, field, especially, from, british, phlogistic, scientists, joseph, priestley, richard, kirwan, james, keir, and, william, nicholson, among, others, argued, that, quantification, of, substances, did, not, imply, conservation, of, mass, rather, than, reporting, factual, evidence, opposition, claimed, lavoisier, was, misinterpreting, the, implications, of, his, research, one, of, lavoisier, s, allies, jean, baptiste, biot, wrote, of, lavoisier, s, methodology, one, felt, the, necessity, of, linking, accuracy, in, experiments, to, rigor, of, reasoning, his, opposition, argued, that, precision, in, experimentation, did, not, imply, precision, in, inferences, and, reasoning, despite, opposition, lavoisier, continued, to, use, precise, instrumentation, to, convince, other, chemists, of, his, conclusions, often, results, to, five, to, eight, decimal, places, nicholson, who, estimated, that, only, three, of, these, decimal, places, were, meaningful, stated, if, it, be, denied, that, these, results, are, pretended, to, be, true, in, the, last, figures, i, must, beg, leave, to, observe, that, these, long, rows, of, figures, which, in, some, instances, extend, to, a, thousand, times, the, nicety, of, experiment, serve, only, to, exhibit, a, parade, which, true, science, has, no, need, of, and, more, than, this, that, when, the, real, degree, of, accuracy, in, experiments, is, thus, hidden, from, our, contemplation, we, are, somewhat, disposed, to, doubt, whether, the, exactitude, scrupuleuse, of, the, experiments, be, indeed, such, as, to, render, the, proofs, de, l, ordre, demonstratif, the, official, version, of, lavoisier, s, easter, memoir, appeared, in, 1778, in, the, intervening, period, lavoisier, had, ample, time, to, repeat, some, of, priestley, s, latest, experiments, and, perform, some, new, ones, of, his, own, in, addition, to, studying, priestley, s, dephlogisticated, air, he, studied, more, thoroughly, the, residual, air, after, metals, had, been, calcined, he, showed, that, this, residual, air, supported, neither, combustion, nor, respiration, and, that, approximately, five, volumes, of, this, air, added, to, one, volume, of, the, dephlogisticated, air, gave, common, atmospheric, air, common, air, was, then, a, mixture, of, two, distinct, chemical, species, with, quite, different, properties, thus, when, the, revised, version, of, the, easter, memoir, was, published, in, 1778, lavoisier, no, longer, stated, that, the, principle, which, combined, with, metals, on, calcination, was, just, common, air, but, nothing, else, than, the, healthiest, and, purest, part, of, the, air, or, the, eminently, respirable, part, of, the, air, the, same, year, he, coined, the, name, oxygen, for, this, constituent, of, the, air, from, the, greek, words, meaning, acid, former, he, was, struck, by, the, fact, that, the, combustion, products, of, such, nonmetals, as, sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and, nitrogen, were, acidic, he, held, that, all, acids, contained, oxygen, and, that, oxygen, was, therefore, the, acidifying, principle, lavoisier, s, chemical, research, between, 1772, and, 1778, was, largely, concerned, with, developing, his, own, new, theory, of, combustion, in, 1783, he, read, to, the, academy, his, paper, entitled, r, flexions, sur, le, phlogistique, reflections, on, phlogiston, a, full, scale, attack, on, the, current, phlogiston, theory, of, combustion, that, year, lavoisier, also, began, a, series, of, experiments, on, the, composition, of, water, which, were, to, prove, an, important, capstone, to, his, combustion, theory, and, win, many, converts, to, it, many, investigators, had, been, experimenting, with, the, combination, of, henry, cavendish, s, inflammable, air, now, known, as, hydrogen, with, dephlogisticated, air, air, in, the, process, of, combustion, now, known, to, be, oxygen, by, electrically, sparking, mixtures, of, the, gases, all, of, the, researchers, noted, cavendish, s, production, of, pure, water, by, burning, hydrogen, in, oxygen, but, they, interpreted, the, reaction, in, varying, ways, within, the, framework, of, phlogiston, theory, lavoisier, learned, of, cavendish, s, experiment, in, june, 1783, via, charles, blagden, before, the, results, were, published, in, 1784, and, immediately, recognized, water, as, the, oxide, of, a, hydroelectric, gas, in, cooperation, with, laplace, lavoisier, synthesized, water, by, burning, jets, of, hydrogen, and, oxygen, in, a, bell, jar, over, mercury, the, quantitative, results, were, good, enough, to, support, the, contention, that, water, was, not, an, element, as, had, been, thought, for, over, 2, 000, years, but, a, compound, of, two, gases, hydrogen, and, oxygen, the, interpretation, of, water, as, a, compound, explained, the, inflammable, air, generated, from, dissolving, metals, in, acids, hydrogen, produced, when, water, decomposes, and, the, reduction, of, calces, by, inflammable, air, a, combination, of, gas, from, calx, with, oxygen, to, form, water, despite, these, experiments, lavoisier, s, antiphlogistic, approach, remained, unaccepted, by, many, other, chemists, lavoisier, labored, to, provide, definitive, proof, of, the, composition, of, water, attempting, to, use, this, in, support, of, his, theory, working, with, jean, baptiste, meusnier, lavoisier, passed, water, through, a, red, hot, iron, gun, barrel, allowing, the, oxygen, to, form, an, oxide, with, the, iron, and, the, hydrogen, to, emerge, from, the, end, of, the, pipe, he, submitted, his, findings, of, the, composition, of, water, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, in, april, 1784, reporting, his, figures, to, eight, decimal, places, opposition, responded, to, this, further, experimentation, by, stating, that, lavoisier, continued, to, draw, the, incorrect, conclusions, and, that, his, experiment, demonstrated, the, displacement, of, phlogiston, from, iron, by, the, combination, of, water, with, the, metal, lavoisier, developed, a, new, apparatus, which, used, a, pneumatic, trough, a, set, of, balances, a, thermometer, and, a, barometer, all, calibrated, carefully, thirty, savants, were, invited, to, witness, the, decomposition, and, synthesis, of, water, using, this, apparatus, convincing, many, who, attended, of, the, correctness, of, lavoisier, s, theories, this, demonstration, established, water, as, a, compound, of, oxygen, and, hydrogen, with, great, certainty, for, those, who, viewed, it, the, dissemination, of, the, experiment, however, proved, subpar, as, it, lacked, the, details, to, properly, display, the, amount, of, precision, taken, in, the, measurements, the, paper, ended, with, a, hasty, statement, that, the, experiment, was, more, than, sufficient, to, lay, hold, of, the, certainty, of, the, proposition, of, the, composition, of, water, and, stated, that, the, methods, used, in, the, experiment, would, unite, chemistry, with, the, other, physical, sciences, and, advance, discoveries, lavoisier, employed, the, new, nomenclature, in, his, trait, l, mentaire, de, chimie, elementary, treatise, on, chemistry, published, in, 1789, this, work, represents, the, synthesis, of, lavoisier, s, contribution, to, chemistry, and, can, be, considered, the, first, modern, textbook, on, the, subject, the, core, of, the, work, was, the, oxygen, theory, and, the, work, became, a, most, effective, vehicle, for, the, transmission, of, the, new, doctrines, it, presented, a, unified, view, of, new, theories, of, chemistry, contained, a, clear, statement, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, mass, and, denied, the, existence, of, phlogiston, this, text, clarified, the, concept, of, an, element, as, a, substance, that, could, not, be, broken, down, by, any, known, method, of, chemical, analysis, and, presented, lavoisier, s, theory, of, the, formation, of, chemical, compounds, from, elements, it, remains, a, classic, in, the, history, of, science, while, many, leading, chemists, of, the, time, refused, to, accept, lavoisier, s, new, ideas, demand, for, trait, l, mentaire, as, a, textbook, in, edinburgh, was, sufficient, to, merit, translation, into, english, within, about, a, year, of, its, french, publication, in, any, event, the, trait, l, mentaire, was, sufficiently, sound, to, convince, the, next, generation, the, relationship, between, combustion, and, respiration, had, long, been, recognized, from, the, essential, role, which, air, played, in, both, processes, lavoisier, was, almost, obliged, therefore, to, extend, his, new, theory, of, combustion, to, include, the, area, of, respiration, physiology, his, first, memoirs, on, this, topic, were, read, to, the, academy, of, sciences, in, 1777, but, his, most, significant, contribution, to, this, field, was, made, in, the, winter, of, 1782, 1783, in, association, with, laplace, the, result, of, this, work, was, published, in, a, memoir, on, heat, lavoisier, and, laplace, designed, an, ice, calorimeter, apparatus, for, measuring, the, amount, of, heat, given, off, during, combustion, or, respiration, the, outer, shell, of, the, calorimeter, was, packed, with, snow, which, melted, to, maintain, a, constant, temperature, of, 0, c, around, an, inner, shell, filled, with, ice, by, measuring, the, quantity, of, carbon, dioxide, and, heat, produced, by, confining, a, live, guinea, pig, in, this, apparatus, and, by, comparing, the, amount, of, heat, produced, when, sufficient, carbon, was, burned, in, the, ice, calorimeter, to, produce, the, same, amount, of, carbon, dioxide, as, that, which, the, guinea, pig, exhaled, they, concluded, that, respiration, was, in, fact, a, slow, combustion, process, lavoisier, stated, la, respiration, est, donc, une, combustion, that, is, respiratory, gas, exchange, is, a, combustion, like, that, of, a, candle, burning, this, continuous, slow, combustion, which, they, supposed, took, place, in, the, lungs, enabled, the, living, animal, to, maintain, its, body, temperature, above, that, of, its, surroundings, thus, accounting, for, the, puzzling, phenomenon, of, animal, heat, lavoisier, continued, these, respiration, experiments, in, 1789, 1790, in, cooperation, with, armand, seguin, they, designed, an, ambitious, set, of, experiments, to, study, the, whole, process, of, body, metabolism, and, respiration, using, seguin, as, a, human, guinea, pig, in, the, experiments, their, work, was, only, partially, completed, and, published, because, of, the, revolution, s, disruption, but, lavoisier, s, pioneering, work, in, this, field, inspired, similar, research, on, physiological, processes, for, generations, lavoisier, s, fundamental, contributions, to, chemistry, were, a, result, of, a, conscious, effort, to, fit, all, experiments, into, the, framework, of, a, single, theory, he, established, the, consistent, use, of, the, chemical, balance, used, oxygen, to, overthrow, the, phlogiston, theory, and, developed, a, new, system, of, chemical, nomenclature, which, held, that, oxygen, was, an, essential, constituent, of, all, acids, which, later, turned, out, to, be, erroneous, lavoisier, also, did, early, research, in, physical, chemistry, and, thermodynamics, in, joint, experiments, with, laplace, they, used, a, calorimeter, to, estimate, the, heat, evolved, per, unit, of, carbon, dioxide, produced, eventually, finding, the, same, ratio, for, a, flame, and, animals, indicating, that, animals, produced, energy, by, a, type, of, combustion, reaction, lavoisier, also, contributed, to, early, ideas, on, composition, and, chemical, changes, by, stating, the, radical, theory, believing, that, radicals, which, function, as, a, single, group, in, a, chemical, process, combine, with, oxygen, in, reactions, he, also, introduced, the, possibility, of, allotropy, in, chemical, elements, when, he, discovered, that, diamond, is, a, crystalline, form, of, carbon, he, was, also, responsible, for, the, construction, of, the, gasometer, an, expensive, instrument, he, used, at, his, demonstrations, while, he, used, his, gasometer, exclusively, for, these, he, also, created, smaller, cheaper, more, practical, gasometers, that, worked, with, a, sufficient, degree, of, precision, that, more, chemists, could, recreate, overall, his, contributions, are, considered, the, most, important, in, advancing, chemistry, to, the, level, reached, in, physics, and, mathematics, during, the, 18th, century, following, his, death, a, collection, comprising, most, of, his, scientific, manuscripts, and, instruments, was, established, by, his, relatives, at, the, ch, teau, de, la, cani, re, in, puy, de, d, me, mount, lavoisier, in, new, zealand, s, paparoa, range, was, named, after, him, in, 1970, by, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, during, his, lifetime, lavoisier, was, awarded, a, gold, medal, by, the, king, of, france, for, his, work, on, urban, street, lighting, 1766, and, was, appointed, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, 1768, he, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1775, lavoisier, s, work, was, recognized, as, an, international, historic, chemical, landmark, by, the, american, chemical, society, acad, mie, des, sciences, de, l, institut, de, france, and, the, soci, t, chimique, de, france, in, 1999,
