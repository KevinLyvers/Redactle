which, co, starred, rock, hudson, and, james, dean, 158, 165, its, filming, in, marfa, texas, was, a, difficult, experience, for, taylor, as, she, clashed, with, stevens, who, wanted, to, break, her, will, to, make, her, easier, to, direct, and, was, often, ill, resulting, in, delays, 158, 165, to, further, complicate, the, production, dean, died, in, a, car, accident, only, days, after,

three, weeks, later, 195, 203, she, later, said, that, in, a, way, became, maggie, and, that, acting, was, the, only, time, i, could, function, in, the, weeks, after, todd, s, death, during, the,

media, as, the, union, of, america, s, sweethearts, 203, 210, the, affair, and, fisher, s, subsequent, divorce, changed, taylor, s, public, image, from, a, grieving, widow, to, a, homewrecker, mgm,
