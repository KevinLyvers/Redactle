marina, or, malintzin, c, 1500, c, 1529, more, popularly, known, as, la, malinche, a, nahua, woman, from, the, mexican, gulf, coast, became, known, for, contributing, to, the, spanish, conquest, of, the, aztec, empire, 1519, 1521, by, acting, as, an, interpreter, advisor, and, intermediary, for, the, spanish, conquistador, hern, n, cort, s, she, was, one, of, 20, enslaved, women, given, to, the, spaniards, in, 1519, by, the, natives, of, tabasco, cort, s, chose, her, as, a, consort, and, she, later, gave, birth, to, his, first, son, mart, n, one, of, the, first, mestizos, people, of, mixed, european, and, indigenous, american, ancestry, in, new, spain, la, malinche, s, reputation, has, shifted, over, the, centuries, as, various, peoples, evaluate, her, role, against, their, own, societies, changing, social, and, political, perspectives, especially, after, the, mexican, war, of, independence, which, led, to, mexico, s, independence, from, spain, in, 1821, dramas, novels, and, paintings, portrayed, her, as, an, evil, or, scheming, temptress, in, mexico, today, la, malinche, remains, a, powerful, icon, understood, in, various, and, often, conflicting, aspects, as, the, embodiment, of, treachery, the, quintessential, victim, or, the, symbolic, mother, of, the, new, mexican, people, the, term, malinchista, refers, to, a, disloyal, compatriot, especially, in, mexico, malinche, is, known, by, many, names, though, her, birth, name, is, unknown, the, nahua, called, her, malintzin, derived, from, malina, a, nahuatl, rendering, of, her, spanish, name, and, the, honorific, suffix, tzin, according, to, historian, camilla, townsend, the, vocative, suffix, e, is, sometimes, added, at, the, end, of, the, name, giving, the, form, malintzine, which, would, be, shortened, to, malintze, and, heard, by, the, spaniards, as, malinche, another, possibility, is, that, the, spaniards, simply, did, not, hear, the, whispered, n, of, the, name, malintzin, the, title, tenepal, was, often, assumed, to, be, part, of, her, name, in, the, annotation, made, by, nahua, historian, chimalpahin, on, his, copy, of, g, mara, s, biography, of, cort, s, malintzin, tenepal, is, used, repeatedly, about, malinche, according, to, linguist, and, historian, frances, karttunen, tenepal, is, probably, derived, from, the, nahuatl, root, tene, which, means, lip, possessor, one, who, speaks, vigorously, or, one, who, has, a, facility, with, words, and, postposition, pal, which, means, through, historian, james, lockhart, however, suggests, that, tenepal, might, be, derived, from, tenenepil, somebody, s, tongue, in, any, case, malintzin, tenepal, appears, to, have, been, a, literal, translation, of, spanish, do, a, marina, la, lengua, with, la, lengua, the, interpreter, literally, meaning, the, tongue, being, her, spanish, sobriquet, malinche, was, baptized, in, the, roman, catholic, church, and, given, the, christian, name, marina, often, preceded, by, the, honorific, do, a, since, at, least, the, 19th, century, she, was, believed, to, have, originally, been, named, malinalli, nahuatl, for, grass, after, the, day, sign, on, which, she, was, supposedly, born, accordingly, marina, was, chosen, as, her, baptismal, name, because, of, its, phonetic, similarity, modern, historians, have, rejected, such, mythic, suggestions, noting, that, the, nahua, associate, the, day, sign, malinalli, with, bad, or, evil, connotations, and, they, are, known, to, avoid, using, such, day, signs, as, personal, names, moreover, there, would, be, little, reason, for, the, spaniards, to, ask, the, natives, what, their, names, were, before, they, were, christened, with, new, names, after, catholic, saints, malinche, s, birthdate, is, unknown, but, it, is, estimated, to, be, around, 1500, and, likely, no, later, than, 1505, she, was, born, in, an, altepetl, that, was, either, a, part, of, or, a, tributary, of, a, mesoamerican, state, whose, center, was, located, on, the, bank, of, the, coatzacoalcos, river, to, the, east, of, the, aztec, empire, records, disagree, about, the, exact, name, of, the, altepetl, where, she, was, born, in, three, unrelated, legal, proceedings, that, occurred, not, long, after, her, death, various, witnesses, who, claimed, to, have, known, her, personally, including, her, daughter, said, that, she, was, born, in, olutla, the, probanza, of, her, grandson, also, mentioned, olutla, as, her, birthplace, her, daughter, added, that, the, altepetl, of, olutla, was, related, to, tetiquipaque, although, the, nature, of, this, relationship, is, unclear, in, the, florentine, codex, malinche, s, homeland, is, mentioned, as, teticpac, which, is, most, likely, the, singular, form, of, tetiquipaque, g, mara, writes, that, she, came, from, uiluta, presumably, a, variant, of, olutla, he, departs, from, other, sources, by, writing, that, it, was, in, the, region, of, jalisco, d, az, on, the, other, hand, gives, painalla, as, her, birthplace, her, family, is, reported, to, have, been, of, noble, background, g, mara, writes, that, her, father, was, related, to, a, local, ruler, while, d, az, recounts, that, her, parents, were, rulers, townsend, notes, that, while, olutla, at, the, time, probably, had, a, popoluca, speaking, majority, the, ruling, elite, which, malinche, supposedly, belonged, to, would, have, been, nahuatl, speaking, another, hint, that, supports, her, noble, origin, is, her, apparent, ability, to, understand, the, courtly, language, of, tecpillahtolli, lordly, speech, a, nahuatl, register, that, is, significantly, different, from, the, commoner, s, speech, and, has, to, be, learned, the, fact, that, she, was, often, referred, to, as, a, do, a, at, the, time, a, term, in, spain, not, commonly, used, when, referring, to, someone, outside, of, the, aristocracy, indicates, that, she, was, viewed, as, a, noblewoman, but, she, may, have, been, given, this, honorific, by, the, spanish, because, of, recognition, of, her, important, role, in, the, conquest, malinche, was, probably, between, the, ages, of, 8, and, 12, when, she, was, either, sold, or, kidnapped, into, slavery, d, az, wrote, that, after, her, father, s, death, she, was, given, away, to, merchants, by, her, mother, and, stepfather, so, that, their, son, malinche, s, halfbrother, would, have, the, rights, of, an, heir, scholars, historians, and, literary, critics, alike, have, cast, doubt, upon, d, az, s, account, of, her, origin, in, large, part, due, to, his, strong, emphasis, on, catholicism, throughout, his, narration, of, the, events, in, particular, historian, sonia, rose, de, fuggle, analyzes, d, az, s, over, reliance, on, polysyndeton, which, mimics, the, sentence, structure, of, many, biblical, stories, as, well, as, his, overarching, portrayal, of, malinche, as, an, ideal, christian, woman, but, townsend, believes, that, it, was, likely, that, some, of, her, people, were, complicit, in, trafficking, her, regardless, of, the, reason, malinche, was, taken, to, xicalango, a, major, port, city, in, the, region, she, was, later, purchased, by, a, group, of, chontal, maya, who, brought, her, to, the, town, of, potonch, n, it, was, here, that, malinche, started, to, learn, the, chontal, maya, language, and, perhaps, also, yucatec, maya, her, acquisition, of, the, language, later, enabled, her, to, communicate, with, jer, nimo, de, aguilar, another, interpreter, for, cortes, who, also, spoke, yucatec, maya, as, well, as, his, native, spanish, motecu, oma, was, told, how, the, spaniards, were, bringing, along, with, them, a, mexica, indian, woman, called, marina, a, citizen, of, the, settlement, of, teticpac, on, the, shore, of, the, north, sea, who, served, as, interpreter, and, said, in, the, mexican, language, everything, that, captain, don, hernando, cort, s, told, her, to, report, from, the, emissaries, to, moctezuma, florentine, codex, book, xii, chapter, ix, early, in, his, expedition, to, mexico, cort, s, was, confronted, by, the, maya, at, potonch, n, in, the, ensuing, battle, the, mayas, suffered, significant, loss, of, lives, and, asked, for, peace, in, the, following, days, they, presented, the, spaniards, with, gifts, of, food, and, gold, as, well, as, twenty, enslaved, women, including, malinche, the, women, were, baptized, and, distributed, among, cort, s, s, men, who, expected, to, use, them, as, servants, and, sexual, objects, malinche, was, given, to, alonso, hern, ndez, puertocarrero, one, of, cort, s, captains, he, was, a, first, cousin, to, the, count, of, cort, s, s, hometown, medell, n, malinche, s, language, skills, were, discovered, when, the, spaniards, encountered, the, nahuatl, speaking, people, at, san, juan, de, ul, a, moctezuma, s, emissaries, had, come, to, inspect, the, peoples, but, aguilar, could, not, understand, them, historian, g, mara, wrote, that, when, cort, s, realized, that, malinche, could, talk, with, the, emissaries, he, promised, her, more, than, liberty, if, she, would, help, him, find, and, communicate, with, moctezuma, cort, s, took, malinche, from, puertocarrero, he, was, later, given, another, indigenous, woman, before, he, returned, to, spain, aided, by, aguilar, and, malinche, cort, s, talked, with, moctezuma, s, emissaries, the, emissaries, also, brought, artists, to, make, paintings, of, malinche, cort, s, and, the, rest, of, the, group, as, well, as, their, ships, and, weapons, to, be, sent, as, records, for, moctezuma, d, az, later, said, that, the, nahua, addressed, cort, s, as, malinche, they, took, her, as, a, point, of, reference, for, the, group, from, then, on, malinche, worked, with, aguilar, to, bridge, communication, between, the, spaniards, and, the, nahua, cort, s, would, speak, spanish, with, aguilar, who, translated, into, yucatec, maya, for, malinche, who, in, turn, translated, into, nahuatl, before, reversing, the, process, the, translation, chain, grew, even, longer, when, after, the, emissaries, left, the, spaniards, met, the, totonac, whose, language, was, not, understood, by, either, malinche, or, aguilar, there, malinche, asked, for, nahuatl, interpreters, karttunen, remarks, that, it, is, a, wonder, any, communication, was, accomplished, at, all, for, cort, s, spanish, words, had, to, be, translated, into, maya, nahuatl, and, totonac, before, reaching, the, locals, whose, answers, went, back, through, the, same, chain, meeting, with, the, totonac, was, how, the, spaniards, first, learned, of, opponents, to, moctezuma, after, founding, the, town, of, villa, rica, de, la, vera, cruz, to, be, freed, from, the, legal, restriction, of, what, was, supposed, to, be, an, exploratory, mission, the, spaniards, stayed, for, two, months, in, a, nearby, totonac, settlement, they, secured, a, formal, alliance, with, the, totonac, and, prepared, for, a, march, toward, tenochtitlan, the, first, major, polity, that, they, encountered, on, the, way, to, tenochtitlan, was, tlaxcala, although, the, tlaxcaltec, were, initially, hostile, to, the, spaniards, and, their, allies, they, later, permitted, the, spaniards, to, enter, the, city, the, tlaxcalans, negotiated, an, alliance, with, the, spaniards, through, malinche, and, aguilar, later, tlaxcalan, visual, records, of, this, meeting, feature, malinche, as, a, prominent, figure, she, appears, to, bridge, communication, between, the, two, sides, as, the, tlaxcalan, presented, the, spaniards, with, gifts, of, food, and, noblewomen, to, cement, the, alliance, after, several, days, in, tlaxcala, cort, s, continued, the, journey, to, tenochtitlan, by, the, way, of, cholula, by, then, he, was, accompanied, by, a, large, number, of, tlaxcalan, soldiers, the, spaniards, were, received, at, cholula, and, housed, for, several, days, the, explorers, claimed, that, the, cholulans, stopped, giving, them, food, dug, secret, pits, built, a, barricade, around, the, city, and, hid, a, large, aztec, army, in, the, outskirts, to, prepare, for, an, attack, against, the, spaniards, somehow, the, europeans, learned, of, this, and, in, a, preemptive, strike, assembled, and, massacred, the, cholulans, later, accounts, claimed, that, malinche, had, uncovered, the, plot, according, to, d, az, she, was, approached, by, a, cholulan, noblewoman, who, promised, her, a, marriage, to, the, woman, s, son, if, she, were, to, switch, sides, pretending, to, go, along, with, the, suggestion, malinche, was, told, about, the, plot, and, later, reported, all, the, details, to, cort, s, in, later, centuries, this, story, has, often, been, cited, as, an, example, of, malinche, s, betrayal, of, her, people, but, modern, historians, such, as, hassig, and, townsend, have, suggested, that, malinche, s, heroic, discovery, of, the, purported, plot, was, likely, already, a, fabricated, story, intended, to, provide, cort, s, with, political, justification, for, his, actions, to, distant, spanish, authorities, in, particular, hassig, suggests, that, cort, s, seeking, stronger, native, alliances, leading, to, the, invasion, of, tenochtitlan, worked, with, the, tlaxcalans, to, coordinate, the, massacre, cholula, had, supported, tlaxcala, before, joining, the, aztec, empire, one, or, two, years, prior, and, losing, them, as, an, ally, had, been, a, severe, blow, to, the, tlaxcalans, their, state, was, now, completely, encircled, by, the, aztecs, hassig, and, other, historians, assert, that, tlaxcalans, considered, the, attack, on, the, cholulans, as, a, litmus, test, of, the, spanish, commitment, to, them, the, combined, forces, reached, tenochtitlan, in, early, november, 1519, where, they, were, met, by, moctezuma, on, a, causeway, leading, to, the, city, malinche, was, in, the, middle, of, this, event, translating, the, conversation, between, cort, s, and, moctezuma, gomara, writes, that, moctezuma, was, speaking, through, malinche, and, aguilar, although, other, records, indicate, that, malinche, was, already, translating, directly, as, she, had, quickly, learned, some, spanish, herself, moctezuma, s, flowery, speech, delivered, through, malinche, at, the, meeting, has, been, claimed, by, the, spaniards, to, represent, a, submission, but, this, interpretation, is, not, followed, by, modern, historians, the, deferential, nature, of, the, speech, can, be, explained, by, moctezuma, s, usage, of, tecpillahtolli, a, nahuatl, register, known, for, its, indirection, and, complex, set, of, reverential, affixes, despite, malinche, s, apparent, ability, to, understand, tecpillahtolli, it, is, possible, that, some, nuances, were, lost, in, translation, the, spaniards, deliberately, or, not, may, have, misinterpreted, moctezuma, s, words, tenochtitl, n, fell, in, late, 1521, and, marina, s, son, by, cortes, mart, n, cort, s, was, born, in, 1522, during, this, time, malinche, or, marina, stayed, in, a, house, cort, s, built, for, her, in, the, town, of, coyoac, n, eight, miles, south, of, tenochtitl, n, the, aztec, capital, city, was, being, redeveloped, to, serve, as, spanish, controlled, mexico, city, cort, s, took, marina, to, help, quell, a, rebellion, in, honduras, in, 1524, 1526, when, she, again, served, as, interpreter, she, may, have, known, mayan, languages, beyond, chontal, and, yucatec, while, in, the, mountain, town, of, orizaba, in, central, mexico, she, married, juan, jaramillo, a, spanish, hidalgo, some, contemporary, scholars, have, estimated, that, she, died, less, than, a, decade, after, the, conquest, of, mexico, tenochtitlan, at, some, point, before, february, 1529, she, was, survived, by, her, son, don, mart, n, who, would, be, raised, primarily, by, his, father, s, family, and, a, daughter, do, a, mar, a, who, would, be, raised, by, jaramillo, and, his, second, wife, do, a, beatriz, de, andrada, although, mart, n, was, cort, s, s, first, born, son, and, eventual, heir, his, relation, to, marina, was, poorly, documented, by, prominent, spanish, historians, such, as, francisco, l, pez, de, g, mara, he, never, referred, to, marina, by, name, even, in, her, work, as, cort, s, s, translator, even, during, marina, s, lifetime, she, spent, little, time, with, mart, n, but, many, scholars, and, historians, have, marked, her, multiracial, child, with, cort, s, as, the, symbolic, beginning, of, the, large, mestizo, population, that, developed, in, mesoamerica, for, the, conquistadores, having, a, reliable, interpreter, was, important, enough, but, there, is, evidence, that, marina, s, role, and, influence, were, larger, still, bernal, d, az, del, castillo, a, soldier, who, as, an, old, man, produced, the, most, comprehensive, of, the, eye, witness, accounts, the, historia, verdadera, de, la, conquista, de, la, nueva, espa, a, true, story, of, the, conquest, of, new, spain, speaks, repeatedly, and, reverentially, of, the, great, lady, do, a, marina, always, using, the, honorific, title, do, a, without, the, help, of, do, a, marina, he, writes, we, would, not, have, understood, the, language, of, new, spain, and, mexico, rodr, guez, de, oca, a, another, conquistador, relates, cort, s, assertion, that, after, god, marina, was, the, main, reason, for, his, success, the, evidence, from, indigenous, sources, is, even, more, interesting, both, in, the, commentaries, about, her, role, and, in, her, prominence, in, the, codex, drawings, made, of, conquest, events, although, to, some, marina, may, be, known, as, a, traitor, she, was, not, viewed, as, such, by, all, the, tlaxcalan, in, some, depictions, they, portrayed, her, as, larger, than, life, sometimes, larger, than, cort, s, in, rich, clothing, and, an, alliance, is, shown, between, her, and, the, tlaxcalan, instead, of, them, and, the, spaniards, they, respected, and, trusted, her, and, portrayed, her, in, this, light, generations, after, the, spanish, conquest, in, the, lienzo, de, tlaxcala, history, of, tlaxcala, for, example, not, only, is, cort, s, rarely, portrayed, without, marina, poised, by, his, side, but, she, is, shown, at, times, on, her, own, seemingly, directing, events, as, an, independent, authority, if, she, had, been, trained, for, court, life, as, in, d, az, s, account, her, relationship, with, cort, s, may, have, followed, the, familiar, pattern, of, marriage, among, native, elite, classes, the, role, of, the, nahua, wife, acquired, through, an, alliance, would, have, been, to, assist, her, husband, achieve, his, military, and, diplomatic, objectives, today, s, historians, give, great, credit, to, marina, s, diplomatic, skills, with, some, almost, tempted, to, think, of, her, as, the, real, conqueror, of, mexico, old, conquistadors, on, various, occasions, recalled, that, one, of, her, greatest, skills, had, been, her, ability, to, convince, other, natives, of, what, she, could, perceive, that, it, was, useless, in, the, long, run, to, stand, against, spanish, metal, arms, and, spanish, ships, in, contrast, to, earlier, parts, of, d, az, del, castillo, s, account, after, marina, began, assisting, cort, s, the, spanish, were, forced, into, combat, on, one, more, occasion, had, la, malinche, not, been, part, of, the, conquest, of, mexico, for, her, language, skills, communication, between, the, spanish, and, the, indigenous, peoples, would, have, been, much, harder, la, malinche, knew, how, to, speak, in, different, registers, and, tones, among, certain, indigenous, tribes, and, classes, of, people, for, the, nahua, audiences, she, spoke, rhetorically, formally, and, high, handedly, this, shift, into, formality, gave, the, nahua, the, impression, that, she, was, a, noblewoman, who, knew, what, she, was, talking, about, malinche, s, image, has, become, a, mythical, archetype, that, hispanic, american, artists, have, represented, in, various, forms, of, art, her, figure, permeates, historical, cultural, and, social, dimensions, of, hispanic, american, cultures, in, modern, times, and, several, genres, she, is, compared, with, the, la, llorona, folklore, story, of, the, woman, weeping, for, lost, children, and, the, mexican, soldaderas, women, who, fought, beside, men, during, the, mexican, revolution, for, their, brave, actions, la, malinche, s, legacy, is, one, of, myth, mixed, with, legend, and, the, opposing, opinions, of, the, mexican, people, about, the, legendary, woman, some, see, her, as, a, founding, figure, of, the, mexican, nation, while, others, continue, to, see, her, as, a, traitor, as, may, be, assumed, from, a, legend, that, she, had, a, twin, sister, who, went, north, and, from, the, pejorative, nickname, la, chingada, associated, with, her, twin, feminist, interventions, into, the, figure, of, malinche, began, in, the, 1960s, the, work, of, rosario, castellanos, was, particularly, significant, chicanas, began, to, refer, to, her, as, a, mother, as, they, adopted, her, as, symbolism, for, duality, and, complex, identity, castellanos, s, subsequent, poem, la, mallinche, recast, her, not, as, a, traitor, but, as, a, victim, mexican, feminists, defended, malinche, as, a, woman, caught, between, cultures, forced, to, make, complex, decisions, who, ultimately, served, as, a, mother, of, a, new, race, today, in, mexican, spanish, the, words, malinchismo, and, malinchista, are, used, to, denounce, mexicans, who, are, perceived, as, denying, their, cultural, heritage, by, preferring, foreign, cultural, expressions, some, historians, believe, that, la, malinche, saved, her, people, from, the, aztecs, who, held, a, hegemony, throughout, the, territory, and, demanded, tribute, from, its, inhabitants, some, mexicans, also, credit, her, with, having, brought, christianity, to, the, new, world, from, europe, and, for, having, influenced, cort, s, to, be, more, humane, than, he, would, otherwise, have, been, it, is, argued, however, that, without, her, help, cort, s, would, not, have, been, successful, in, conquering, the, aztecs, as, quickly, giving, the, aztec, people, enough, time, to, adapt, to, new, technology, and, methods, of, warfare, from, that, viewpoint, she, is, seen, as, one, who, betrayed, the, indigenous, people, by, siding, with, the, spaniards, recently, several, feminist, latinas, have, decried, such, categorization, as, scapegoating, president, jos, l, pez, portillo, commissioned, a, sculpture, of, cort, s, do, a, marina, and, their, son, mart, n, which, was, placed, in, front, of, cort, s, house, in, the, coyoac, n, section, of, mexico, city, once, l, pez, portillo, left, office, the, sculpture, was, removed, to, an, obscure, park, in, the, capital
