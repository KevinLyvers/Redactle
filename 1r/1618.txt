niels, henrik, david, bohr, danish, 7, october, 1885, 18, november, 1962, was, a, danish, physicist, who, made, foundational, contributions, to, understanding, atomic, structure, and, quantum, theory, for, which, he, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1922, bohr, was, also, a, philosopher, and, a, promoter, of, scientific, research, bohr, developed, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, in, which, he, proposed, that, energy, levels, of, electrons, are, discrete, and, that, the, electrons, revolve, in, stable, orbits, around, the, atomic, nucleus, but, can, jump, from, one, energy, level, or, orbit, to, another, although, the, bohr, model, has, been, supplanted, by, other, models, its, underlying, principles, remain, valid, he, conceived, the, principle, of, complementarity, that, items, could, be, separately, analysed, in, terms, of, contradictory, properties, like, behaving, as, a, wave, or, a, stream, of, particles, the, notion, of, complementarity, dominated, bohr, s, thinking, in, both, science, and, philosophy, bohr, founded, the, institute, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, now, known, as, the, niels, bohr, institute, which, opened, in, 1920, bohr, mentored, and, collaborated, with, physicists, including, hans, kramers, oskar, klein, george, de, hevesy, and, werner, heisenberg, he, predicted, the, properties, of, a, new, zirconium, like, element, which, was, named, hafnium, after, the, latin, name, for, copenhagen, where, it, was, discovered, later, the, synthetic, element, bohrium, was, named, after, him, during, the, 1930s, bohr, helped, refugees, from, nazism, after, denmark, was, occupied, by, the, germans, he, met, with, heisenberg, who, had, become, the, head, of, the, german, nuclear, weapon, project, in, september, 1943, word, reached, bohr, that, he, was, about, to, be, arrested, by, the, germans, so, he, fled, to, sweden, from, there, he, was, flown, to, britain, where, he, joined, the, british, tube, alloys, nuclear, weapons, project, and, was, part, of, the, british, mission, to, the, manhattan, project, after, the, war, bohr, called, for, international, cooperation, on, nuclear, energy, he, was, involved, with, the, establishment, of, cern, and, the, research, establishment, ris, of, the, danish, atomic, energy, commission, and, became, the, first, chairman, of, the, nordic, institute, for, theoretical, physics, in, 1957, niels, henrik, david, bohr, was, born, in, copenhagen, denmark, on, 7, october, 1885, the, second, of, three, children, of, christian, bohr, a, professor, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, and, his, wife, ellen, n, e, adler, who, came, from, a, wealthy, jewish, banking, family, he, had, an, elder, sister, jenny, and, a, younger, brother, harald, jenny, became, a, teacher, while, harald, became, a, mathematician, and, footballer, who, played, for, the, danish, national, team, at, the, 1908, summer, olympics, in, london, niels, was, a, passionate, footballer, as, well, and, the, two, brothers, played, several, matches, for, the, copenhagen, based, akademisk, boldklub, academic, football, club, with, niels, as, goalkeeper, bohr, was, educated, at, gammelholm, latin, school, starting, when, he, was, seven, in, 1903, bohr, enrolled, as, an, undergraduate, at, copenhagen, university, his, major, was, physics, which, he, studied, under, professor, christian, christiansen, the, university, s, only, professor, of, physics, at, that, time, he, also, studied, astronomy, and, mathematics, under, professor, thorvald, thiele, and, philosophy, under, professor, harald, h, ffding, a, friend, of, his, father, in, 1905, a, gold, medal, competition, was, sponsored, by, the, royal, danish, academy, of, sciences, and, letters, to, investigate, a, method, for, measuring, the, surface, tension, of, liquids, that, had, been, proposed, by, lord, rayleigh, in, 1879, this, involved, measuring, the, frequency, of, oscillation, of, the, radius, of, a, water, jet, bohr, conducted, a, series, of, experiments, using, his, father, s, laboratory, in, the, university, the, university, itself, had, no, physics, laboratory, to, complete, his, experiments, he, had, to, make, his, own, glassware, creating, test, tubes, with, the, required, elliptical, cross, sections, he, went, beyond, the, original, task, incorporating, improvements, into, both, rayleigh, s, theory, and, his, method, by, taking, into, account, the, viscosity, of, the, water, and, by, working, with, finite, amplitudes, instead, of, just, infinitesimal, ones, his, essay, which, he, submitted, at, the, last, minute, won, the, prize, he, later, submitted, an, improved, version, of, the, paper, to, the, royal, society, in, london, for, publication, in, the, philosophical, transactions, of, the, royal, society, harald, became, the, first, of, the, two, bohr, brothers, to, earn, a, master, s, degree, which, he, earned, for, mathematics, in, april, 1909, niels, took, another, nine, months, to, earn, his, on, the, electron, theory, of, metals, a, topic, assigned, by, his, supervisor, christiansen, bohr, subsequently, elaborated, his, master, s, thesis, into, his, much, larger, doctor, of, philosophy, thesis, he, surveyed, the, literature, on, the, subject, settling, on, a, model, postulated, by, paul, drude, and, elaborated, by, hendrik, lorentz, in, which, the, electrons, in, a, metal, are, considered, to, behave, like, a, gas, bohr, extended, lorentz, s, model, but, was, still, unable, to, account, for, phenomena, like, the, hall, effect, and, concluded, that, electron, theory, could, not, fully, explain, the, magnetic, properties, of, metals, the, thesis, was, accepted, in, april, 1911, and, bohr, conducted, his, formal, defence, on, 13, may, harald, had, received, his, doctorate, the, previous, year, bohr, s, thesis, was, groundbreaking, but, attracted, little, interest, outside, scandinavia, because, it, was, written, in, danish, a, copenhagen, university, requirement, at, the, time, in, 1921, the, dutch, physicist, hendrika, johanna, van, leeuwen, would, independently, derive, a, theorem, in, bohr, s, thesis, that, is, today, known, as, the, bohr, van, leeuwen, theorem, in, 1910, bohr, met, margrethe, n, rlund, the, sister, of, the, mathematician, niels, erik, n, rlund, bohr, resigned, his, membership, in, the, church, of, denmark, on, 16, april, 1912, and, he, and, margrethe, were, married, in, a, civil, ceremony, at, the, town, hall, in, slagelse, on, 1, august, years, later, his, brother, harald, similarly, left, the, church, before, getting, married, bohr, and, margrethe, had, six, sons, the, oldest, christian, died, in, a, boating, accident, in, 1934, and, another, harald, was, severely, mentally, disabled, he, was, placed, in, an, institution, away, from, his, family, s, home, at, the, age, of, four, and, died, from, childhood, meningitis, six, years, later, aage, bohr, became, a, successful, physicist, and, in, 1975, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, like, his, father, a, son, of, aage, vilhelm, a, bohr, is, a, scientist, affiliated, with, the, university, of, copenhagen, and, the, national, institute, on, aging, in, the, u, s, hans, became, a, physician, erik, a, chemical, engineer, and, ernest, a, lawyer, like, his, uncle, harald, ernest, bohr, became, an, olympic, athlete, playing, field, hockey, for, denmark, at, the, 1948, summer, olympics, in, london, in, september, 1911, bohr, supported, by, a, fellowship, from, the, carlsberg, foundation, travelled, to, england, where, most, of, the, theoretical, work, on, the, structure, of, atoms, and, molecules, was, being, done, he, met, j, j, thomson, of, the, cavendish, laboratory, and, trinity, college, cambridge, he, attended, lectures, on, electromagnetism, given, by, james, jeans, and, joseph, larmor, and, did, some, research, on, cathode, rays, but, failed, to, impress, thomson, he, had, more, success, with, younger, physicists, like, the, australian, william, lawrence, bragg, and, new, zealand, s, ernest, rutherford, whose, 1911, small, central, nucleus, rutherford, model, of, the, atom, had, challenged, thomson, s, 1904, plum, pudding, model, bohr, received, an, invitation, from, rutherford, to, conduct, post, doctoral, work, at, victoria, university, of, manchester, where, bohr, met, george, de, hevesy, and, charles, galton, darwin, whom, bohr, referred, to, as, the, grandson, of, the, real, darwin, bohr, returned, to, denmark, in, july, 1912, for, his, wedding, and, travelled, around, england, and, scotland, on, his, honeymoon, on, his, return, he, became, a, privatdocent, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, giving, lectures, on, thermodynamics, martin, knudsen, put, bohr, s, name, forward, for, a, docent, which, was, approved, in, july, 1913, and, bohr, then, began, teaching, medical, students, his, three, papers, which, later, became, famous, as, the, trilogy, were, published, in, philosophical, magazine, in, july, september, and, november, of, that, year, he, adapted, rutherford, s, nuclear, structure, to, max, planck, s, quantum, theory, and, so, created, his, bohr, model, of, the, atom, planetary, models, of, atoms, were, not, new, but, bohr, s, treatment, was, taking, the, 1912, paper, by, darwin, on, the, role, of, electrons, in, the, interaction, of, alpha, particles, with, a, nucleus, as, his, starting, point, he, advanced, the, theory, of, electrons, travelling, in, orbits, of, quantized, stationary, states, around, the, atom, s, nucleus, in, order, to, stabilize, the, atom, but, it, wasn, t, until, his, 1921, paper, that, he, showed, that, the, chemical, properties, of, each, element, were, largely, determined, by, the, number, of, electrons, in, the, outer, orbits, of, its, atoms, he, introduced, the, idea, that, an, electron, could, drop, from, a, higher, energy, orbit, to, a, lower, one, in, the, process, emitting, a, quantum, of, discrete, energy, this, became, a, basis, for, what, is, now, known, as, the, old, quantum, theory, in, 1885, johann, balmer, had, come, up, with, his, balmer, series, to, describe, the, visible, spectral, lines, of, a, hydrogen, atom, where, is, the, wavelength, of, the, absorbed, or, emitted, light, and, r, h, is, the, rydberg, constant, balmer, s, formula, was, corroborated, by, the, discovery, of, additional, spectral, lines, but, for, thirty, years, no, one, could, explain, why, it, worked, in, the, first, paper, of, his, trilogy, bohr, was, able, to, derive, it, from, his, model, where, m, e, is, the, electron, s, mass, e, is, its, charge, h, is, the, planck, constant, and, z, is, the, atom, s, atomic, number, 1, for, hydrogen, the, model, s, first, hurdle, was, the, pickering, series, lines, that, did, not, fit, balmer, s, formula, when, challenged, on, this, by, alfred, fowler, bohr, replied, that, they, were, caused, by, ionised, helium, helium, atoms, with, only, one, electron, the, bohr, model, was, found, to, work, for, such, ions, many, older, physicists, like, thomson, rayleigh, and, hendrik, lorentz, did, not, like, the, trilogy, but, the, younger, generation, including, rutherford, david, hilbert, albert, einstein, enrico, fermi, max, born, and, arnold, sommerfeld, saw, it, as, a, breakthrough, the, trilogy, s, acceptance, was, entirely, due, to, its, ability, to, explain, phenomena, that, stymied, other, models, and, to, predict, results, that, were, subsequently, verified, by, experiments, today, the, bohr, model, of, the, atom, has, been, superseded, but, is, still, the, best, known, model, of, the, atom, as, it, often, appears, in, high, school, physics, and, chemistry, texts, bohr, did, not, enjoy, teaching, medical, students, he, later, admitted, that, he, was, not, a, good, lecturer, because, he, needed, a, balance, between, clarity, and, truth, between, klarheit, und, wahrheit, he, decided, to, return, to, manchester, where, rutherford, had, offered, him, a, job, as, a, reader, in, place, of, darwin, whose, tenure, had, expired, bohr, accepted, he, took, a, leave, of, absence, from, the, university, of, copenhagen, which, he, started, by, taking, a, holiday, in, tyrol, with, his, brother, harald, and, aunt, hanna, adler, there, he, visited, the, university, of, g, ttingen, and, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, where, he, met, sommerfeld, and, conducted, seminars, on, the, trilogy, the, first, world, war, broke, out, while, they, were, in, tyrol, greatly, complicating, the, trip, back, to, denmark, and, bohr, s, subsequent, voyage, with, margrethe, to, england, where, he, arrived, in, october, 1914, they, stayed, until, july, 1916, by, which, time, he, had, been, appointed, to, the, chair, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, a, position, created, especially, for, him, his, docentship, was, abolished, at, the, same, time, so, he, still, had, to, teach, physics, to, medical, students, new, professors, were, formally, introduced, to, king, christian, x, who, expressed, his, delight, at, meeting, such, a, famous, football, player, in, april, 1917, bohr, began, a, campaign, to, establish, an, institute, of, theoretical, physics, he, gained, the, support, of, the, danish, government, and, the, carlsberg, foundation, and, sizeable, contributions, were, also, made, by, industry, and, private, donors, many, of, them, jewish, legislation, establishing, the, institute, was, passed, in, november, 1918, now, known, as, the, niels, bohr, institute, it, opened, on, 3, march, 1921, with, bohr, as, its, director, his, family, moved, into, an, apartment, on, the, first, floor, bohr, s, institute, served, as, a, focal, point, for, researchers, into, quantum, mechanics, and, related, subjects, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, when, most, of, the, world, s, best, known, theoretical, physicists, spent, some, time, in, his, company, early, arrivals, included, hans, kramers, from, the, netherlands, oskar, klein, from, sweden, george, de, hevesy, from, hungary, wojciech, rubinowicz, from, poland, and, svein, rosseland, from, norway, bohr, became, widely, appreciated, as, their, congenial, host, and, eminent, colleague, klein, and, rosseland, produced, the, institute, s, first, publication, even, before, it, opened, the, bohr, model, worked, well, for, hydrogen, and, ionized, single, electron, helium, which, impressed, einstein, but, could, not, explain, more, complex, elements, by, 1919, bohr, was, moving, away, from, the, idea, that, electrons, orbited, the, nucleus, and, developed, heuristics, to, describe, them, the, rare, earth, elements, posed, a, particular, classification, problem, for, chemists, because, they, were, so, chemically, similar, an, important, development, came, in, 1924, with, wolfgang, pauli, s, discovery, of, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, which, put, bohr, s, models, on, a, firm, theoretical, footing, bohr, was, then, able, to, declare, that, the, as, yet, undiscovered, element, 72, was, not, a, rare, earth, element, but, an, element, with, chemical, properties, similar, to, those, of, zirconium, elements, had, been, predicted, and, discovered, since, 1871, by, chemical, properties, and, bohr, was, immediately, challenged, by, the, french, chemist, georges, urbain, who, claimed, to, have, discovered, a, rare, earth, element, 72, which, he, called, celtium, at, the, institute, in, copenhagen, dirk, coster, and, george, de, hevesy, took, up, the, challenge, of, proving, bohr, right, and, urbain, wrong, starting, with, a, clear, idea, of, the, chemical, properties, of, the, unknown, element, greatly, simplified, the, search, process, they, went, through, samples, from, copenhagen, s, museum, of, mineralogy, looking, for, a, zirconium, like, element, and, soon, found, it, the, element, which, they, named, hafnium, hafnia, being, the, latin, name, for, copenhagen, turned, out, to, be, more, common, than, gold, in, 1922, bohr, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, services, in, the, investigation, of, the, structure, of, atoms, and, of, the, radiation, emanating, from, them, the, award, thus, recognized, both, the, trilogy, and, his, early, leading, work, in, the, emerging, field, of, quantum, mechanics, for, his, nobel, lecture, bohr, gave, his, audience, a, comprehensive, survey, of, what, was, then, known, about, the, structure, of, the, atom, including, the, correspondence, principle, which, he, had, formulated, this, states, that, the, behavior, of, systems, described, by, quantum, theory, reproduces, classical, physics, in, the, limit, of, large, quantum, numbers, the, discovery, of, compton, scattering, by, arthur, holly, compton, in, 1923, convinced, most, physicists, that, light, was, composed, of, photons, and, that, energy, and, momentum, were, conserved, in, collisions, between, electrons, and, photons, in, 1924, bohr, kramers, and, john, c, slater, an, american, physicist, working, at, the, institute, in, copenhagen, proposed, the, bohr, kramers, slater, theory, bks, it, was, more, of, a, program, than, a, full, physical, theory, as, the, ideas, it, developed, were, not, worked, out, quantitatively, the, bks, theory, became, the, final, attempt, at, understanding, the, interaction, of, matter, and, electromagnetic, radiation, on, the, basis, of, the, old, quantum, theory, in, which, quantum, phenomena, were, treated, by, imposing, quantum, restrictions, on, a, classical, wave, description, of, the, electromagnetic, field, modelling, atomic, behaviour, under, incident, electromagnetic, radiation, using, virtual, oscillators, at, the, absorption, and, emission, frequencies, rather, than, the, different, apparent, frequencies, of, the, bohr, orbits, led, max, born, werner, heisenberg, and, kramers, to, explore, different, mathematical, models, they, led, to, the, development, of, matrix, mechanics, the, first, form, of, modern, quantum, mechanics, the, bks, theory, also, generated, discussion, of, and, renewed, attention, to, difficulties, in, the, foundations, of, the, old, quantum, theory, the, most, provocative, element, of, bks, that, momentum, and, energy, would, not, necessarily, be, conserved, in, each, interaction, but, only, statistically, was, soon, shown, to, be, in, conflict, with, experiments, conducted, by, walther, bothe, and, hans, geiger, in, light, of, these, results, bohr, informed, darwin, that, there, is, nothing, else, to, do, than, to, give, our, revolutionary, efforts, as, honourable, a, funeral, as, possible, the, introduction, of, spin, by, george, uhlenbeck, and, samuel, goudsmit, in, november, 1925, was, a, milestone, the, next, month, bohr, travelled, to, leiden, to, attend, celebrations, of, the, 50th, anniversary, of, hendrick, lorentz, receiving, his, doctorate, when, his, train, stopped, in, hamburg, he, was, met, by, wolfgang, pauli, and, otto, stern, who, asked, for, his, opinion, of, the, spin, theory, bohr, pointed, out, that, he, had, concerns, about, the, interaction, between, electrons, and, magnetic, fields, when, he, arrived, in, leiden, paul, ehrenfest, and, albert, einstein, informed, bohr, that, einstein, had, resolved, this, problem, using, relativity, bohr, then, had, uhlenbeck, and, goudsmit, incorporate, this, into, their, paper, thus, when, he, met, werner, heisenberg, and, pascual, jordan, in, g, ttingen, on, the, way, back, he, had, become, in, his, own, words, a, prophet, of, the, electron, magnet, gospel, heisenberg, first, came, to, copenhagen, in, 1924, then, returned, to, g, ttingen, in, june, 1925, shortly, thereafter, developing, the, mathematical, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, when, he, showed, his, results, to, max, born, in, g, ttingen, born, realised, that, they, could, best, be, expressed, using, matrices, this, work, attracted, the, attention, of, the, british, physicist, paul, dirac, who, came, to, copenhagen, for, six, months, in, september, 1926, austrian, physicist, erwin, schr, dinger, also, visited, in, 1926, his, attempt, at, explaining, quantum, physics, in, classical, terms, using, wave, mechanics, impressed, bohr, who, believed, it, contributed, so, much, to, mathematical, clarity, and, simplicity, that, it, represents, a, gigantic, advance, over, all, previous, forms, of, quantum, mechanics, when, kramers, left, the, institute, in, 1926, to, take, up, a, chair, as, professor, of, theoretical, physics, at, the, utrecht, university, bohr, arranged, for, heisenberg, to, return, and, take, kramers, s, place, as, a, lektor, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, heisenberg, worked, in, copenhagen, as, a, university, lecturer, and, assistant, to, bohr, from, 1926, to, 1927, bohr, became, convinced, that, light, behaved, like, both, waves, and, particles, and, in, 1927, experiments, confirmed, the, de, broglie, hypothesis, that, matter, like, electrons, also, behaved, like, waves, he, conceived, the, philosophical, principle, of, complementarity, that, items, could, have, apparently, mutually, exclusive, properties, such, as, being, a, wave, or, a, stream, of, particles, depending, on, the, experimental, framework, he, felt, that, it, was, not, fully, understood, by, professional, philosophers, in, february, 1927, heisenberg, developed, the, first, version, of, the, uncertainty, principle, presenting, it, using, a, thought, experiment, where, an, electron, was, observed, through, a, gamma, ray, microscope, bohr, was, dissatisfied, with, heisenberg, s, argument, since, it, required, only, that, a, measurement, disturb, properties, that, already, existed, rather, than, the, more, radical, idea, that, the, electron, s, properties, could, not, be, discussed, at, all, apart, from, the, context, they, were, measured, in, in, a, paper, presented, at, the, volta, conference, at, como, in, september, 1927, bohr, emphasized, that, heisenberg, s, uncertainty, relations, could, be, derived, from, classical, considerations, about, the, resolving, power, of, optical, instruments, understanding, the, true, meaning, of, complementarity, would, bohr, believed, require, closer, investigation, einstein, preferred, the, determinism, of, classical, physics, over, the, probabilistic, new, quantum, physics, to, which, he, himself, had, contributed, philosophical, issues, that, arose, from, the, novel, aspects, of, quantum, mechanics, became, widely, celebrated, subjects, of, discussion, einstein, and, bohr, had, good, natured, arguments, over, such, issues, throughout, their, lives, in, 1914, carl, jacobsen, the, heir, to, carlsberg, breweries, bequeathed, his, mansion, the, carlsberg, honorary, residence, currently, known, as, carlsberg, academy, to, be, used, for, life, by, the, dane, who, had, made, the, most, prominent, contribution, to, science, literature, or, the, arts, as, an, honorary, residence, danish, resbolig, harald, h, ffding, had, been, the, first, occupant, and, upon, his, death, in, july, 1931, the, royal, danish, academy, of, sciences, and, letters, gave, bohr, occupancy, he, and, his, family, moved, there, in, 1932, he, was, elected, president, of, the, academy, on, 17, march, 1939, by, 1929, the, phenomenon, of, beta, decay, prompted, bohr, to, again, suggest, that, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, be, abandoned, but, enrico, fermi, s, hypothetical, neutrino, and, the, subsequent, 1932, discovery, of, the, neutron, provided, another, explanation, this, prompted, bohr, to, create, a, new, theory, of, the, compound, nucleus, in, 1936, which, explained, how, neutrons, could, be, captured, by, the, nucleus, in, this, model, the, nucleus, could, be, deformed, like, a, drop, of, liquid, he, worked, on, this, with, a, new, collaborator, the, danish, physicist, fritz, kalckar, who, died, suddenly, in, 1938, the, discovery, of, nuclear, fission, by, otto, hahn, in, december, 1938, and, its, theoretical, explanation, by, lise, meitner, generated, intense, interest, among, physicists, bohr, brought, the, news, to, the, united, states, where, he, opened, the, fifth, washington, conference, on, theoretical, physics, with, fermi, on, 26, january, 1939, when, bohr, told, george, placzek, that, this, resolved, all, the, mysteries, of, transuranic, elements, placzek, told, him, that, one, remained, the, neutron, capture, energies, of, uranium, did, not, match, those, of, its, decay, bohr, thought, about, it, for, a, few, minutes, and, then, announced, to, placzek, l, on, rosenfeld, and, john, wheeler, that, i, have, understood, everything, based, on, his, liquid, drop, model, of, the, nucleus, bohr, concluded, that, it, was, the, uranium, 235, isotope, and, not, the, more, abundant, uranium, 238, that, was, primarily, responsible, for, fission, with, thermal, neutrons, in, april, 1940, john, r, dunning, demonstrated, that, bohr, was, correct, in, the, meantime, bohr, and, wheeler, developed, a, theoretical, treatment, which, they, published, in, a, september, 1939, paper, on, the, mechanism, of, nuclear, fission, heisenberg, said, of, bohr, that, he, was, primarily, a, philosopher, not, a, physicist, bohr, read, the, 19th, century, danish, christian, existentialist, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, richard, rhodes, argued, in, the, making, of, the, atomic, bomb, that, bohr, was, influenced, by, kierkegaard, through, h, ffding, in, 1909, bohr, sent, his, brother, kierkegaard, s, stages, on, life, s, way, as, a, birthday, gift, in, the, enclosed, letter, bohr, wrote, it, is, the, only, thing, i, have, to, send, home, but, i, do, not, believe, that, it, would, be, very, easy, to, find, anything, better, i, even, think, it, is, one, of, the, most, delightful, things, i, have, ever, read, bohr, enjoyed, kierkegaard, s, language, and, literary, style, but, mentioned, that, he, had, some, disagreement, with, kierkegaard, s, philosophy, some, of, bohr, s, biographers, suggested, that, this, disagreement, stemmed, from, kierkegaard, s, advocacy, of, christianity, while, bohr, was, an, atheist, there, has, been, some, dispute, over, the, extent, to, which, kierkegaard, influenced, bohr, s, philosophy, and, science, david, favrholdt, argued, that, kierkegaard, had, minimal, influence, over, bohr, s, work, taking, bohr, s, statement, about, disagreeing, with, kierkegaard, at, face, value, while, jan, faye, argued, that, one, can, disagree, with, the, content, of, a, theory, while, accepting, its, general, premises, and, structure, there, has, been, much, subsequent, debate, and, discussion, about, bohr, s, views, and, philosophy, of, quantum, mechanics, regarding, his, ontological, interpretation, of, the, quantum, world, bohr, has, been, seen, as, an, anti, realist, an, instrumentalist, a, phenomenological, realist, or, some, other, kind, of, realist, furthermore, though, some, have, seen, bohr, as, being, a, subjectivist, or, a, positivist, most, philosophers, agree, that, this, is, a, misunderstanding, of, bohr, as, he, never, argued, for, verificationism, or, for, the, idea, that, the, subject, had, a, direct, impact, on, the, outcome, of, a, measurement, bohr, has, often, been, quoted, saying, that, there, is, no, quantum, world, but, only, an, abstract, quantum, physical, description, this, was, not, publicly, said, by, bohr, but, rather, a, private, statement, attributed, to, bohr, by, aage, petersen, in, a, reminiscence, after, his, death, n, david, mermin, recalled, victor, weisskopf, declaring, that, bohr, wouldn, t, have, said, anything, of, the, sort, and, exclaiming, shame, on, aage, petersen, for, putting, those, ridiculous, words, in, bohr, s, mouth, numerous, scholars, have, argued, that, the, philosophy, of, immanuel, kant, had, a, strong, influence, on, bohr, like, kant, bohr, thought, distinguishing, between, the, subject, s, experience, and, the, object, was, an, important, condition, for, attaining, knowledge, this, can, only, be, done, through, the, use, of, causal, and, spatial, temporal, concepts, to, describe, the, subject, s, experience, thus, according, to, jan, faye, bohr, thought, that, it, is, because, of, classical, concepts, like, space, position, time, causation, and, momentum, that, one, can, talk, about, objects, and, their, objective, existence, bohr, held, that, basic, concepts, like, time, are, built, in, to, our, ordinary, language, and, that, the, concepts, of, classical, physics, are, merely, a, refinement, of, them, therefore, for, bohr, classical, concepts, need, to, be, used, to, describe, experiments, that, deal, with, the, quantum, world, bohr, writes, he, account, of, all, evidence, must, be, expressed, in, classical, terms, the, argument, is, simply, that, by, the, word, experiment, we, refer, to, a, situation, where, we, can, tell, to, others, what, we, have, done, and, what, we, have, learned, and, that, therefore, the, account, of, the, experimental, arrangement, and, of, the, results, of, the, observations, must, be, expressed, in, unambiguous, language, with, suitable, application, of, the, terminology, of, classical, physics, aphk, p, 39, according, to, faye, there, are, various, explanations, for, why, bohr, believed, that, classical, concepts, were, necessary, for, describing, quantum, phenomena, faye, groups, explanations, into, five, frameworks, empiricism, i, e, logical, positivism, kantianism, or, neo, kantian, models, of, epistemology, pragmatism, which, focus, on, how, human, beings, experientially, interact, with, atomic, systems, according, to, their, needs, and, interests, darwinianism, i, e, we, are, adapted, to, use, classical, type, concepts, which, l, on, rosenfeld, said, that, we, evolved, to, use, and, experimentalism, which, focuses, strictly, on, the, function, and, outcome, of, experiments, that, thus, must, be, described, classically, these, explanations, are, not, mutually, exclusive, and, at, times, bohr, seems, to, emphasize, some, of, these, aspects, while, at, other, times, he, focuses, on, other, elements, according, to, faye, bohr, thought, of, the, atom, as, real, atoms, are, neither, heuristic, nor, logical, constructions, however, according, to, faye, he, did, not, believe, that, the, quantum, mechanical, formalism, was, true, in, the, sense, that, it, gave, us, a, literal, pictorial, rather, than, a, symbolic, representation, of, the, quantum, world, therefore, bohr, s, theory, of, complementarity, is, first, and, foremost, a, semantic, and, epistemological, reading, of, quantum, mechanics, that, carries, certain, ontological, implications, as, faye, explains, bohr, s, indefinability, thesis, is, that, he, truth, conditions, of, sentences, ascribing, a, certain, kinematic, or, dynamic, value, to, an, atomic, object, are, dependent, on, the, apparatus, involved, in, such, a, way, that, these, truth, conditions, have, to, include, reference, to, the, experimental, setup, as, well, as, the, actual, outcome, of, the, experiment, faye, notes, that, bohr, s, interpretation, makes, no, reference, to, a, collapse, of, the, wave, function, during, measurements, and, indeed, he, never, mentioned, this, idea, instead, bohr, accepted, the, born, statistical, interpretation, because, he, believed, that, the, function, has, only, a, symbolic, meaning, and, does, not, represent, anything, real, since, for, bohr, the, function, is, not, a, literal, pictorial, representation, of, reality, there, can, be, no, real, collapse, of, the, wavefunction, a, much, debated, point, in, recent, literature, is, what, bohr, believed, about, atoms, and, their, reality, and, whether, they, are, something, else, than, what, they, seem, to, be, some, like, henry, folse, argue, that, bohr, saw, a, distinction, between, observed, phenomena, and, a, transcendental, reality, jan, faye, disagrees, with, this, position, and, holds, that, for, bohr, the, quantum, formalism, and, complementarity, was, the, only, thing, we, could, say, about, the, quantum, world, and, that, there, is, no, further, evidence, in, bohr, s, writings, indicating, that, bohr, would, attribute, intrinsic, and, measurement, independent, state, properties, to, atomic, objects, in, addition, to, the, classical, ones, being, manifested, in, measurement, the, rise, of, nazism, in, germany, prompted, many, scholars, to, flee, their, countries, either, because, they, were, jewish, or, because, they, were, political, opponents, of, the, nazi, regime, in, 1933, the, rockefeller, foundation, created, a, fund, to, help, support, refugee, academics, and, bohr, discussed, this, programme, with, the, president, of, the, rockefeller, foundation, max, mason, in, may, 1933, during, a, visit, to, the, united, states, bohr, offered, the, refugees, temporary, jobs, at, the, institute, provided, them, with, financial, support, arranged, for, them, to, be, awarded, fellowships, from, the, rockefeller, foundation, and, ultimately, found, them, places, at, institutions, around, the, world, those, that, he, helped, included, guido, beck, felix, bloch, james, franck, george, de, hevesy, otto, frisch, hilde, levi, lise, meitner, george, placzek, eugene, rabinowitch, stefan, rozental, erich, ernst, schneider, edward, teller, arthur, von, hippel, and, victor, weisskopf, in, april, 1940, early, in, the, second, world, war, nazi, germany, invaded, and, occupied, denmark, to, prevent, the, germans, from, discovering, max, von, laue, s, and, james, franck, s, gold, nobel, medals, bohr, had, de, hevesy, dissolve, them, in, aqua, regia, in, this, form, they, were, stored, on, a, shelf, at, the, institute, until, after, the, war, when, the, gold, was, precipitated, and, the, medals, re, struck, by, the, nobel, foundation, bohr, s, own, medal, had, been, donated, to, an, auction, to, the, finnish, relief, fund, and, was, auctioned, off, in, march, 1940, along, with, the, medal, of, august, krogh, the, buyer, later, donated, the, two, medals, to, the, danish, historical, museum, in, frederiksborg, castle, where, they, are, still, kept, although, bohr, s, medal, temporarily, went, to, space, with, andreas, mogensen, on, iss, expedition, 70, in, 2023, 2024, bohr, kept, the, institute, running, but, all, the, foreign, scholars, departed, bohr, was, aware, of, the, possibility, of, using, uranium, 235, to, construct, an, atomic, bomb, referring, to, it, in, lectures, in, britain, and, denmark, shortly, before, and, after, the, war, started, but, he, did, not, believe, that, it, was, technically, feasible, to, extract, a, sufficient, quantity, of, uranium, 235, in, september, 1941, heisenberg, who, had, become, head, of, the, german, nuclear, energy, project, visited, bohr, in, copenhagen, during, this, meeting, the, two, men, took, a, private, moment, outside, the, content, of, which, has, caused, much, speculation, as, both, gave, differing, accounts, according, to, heisenberg, he, began, to, address, nuclear, energy, morality, and, the, war, to, which, bohr, seems, to, have, reacted, by, terminating, the, conversation, abruptly, while, not, giving, heisenberg, hints, about, his, own, opinions, ivan, supek, one, of, heisenberg, s, students, and, friends, claimed, that, the, main, subject, of, the, meeting, was, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, who, had, proposed, trying, to, persuade, bohr, to, mediate, peace, between, britain, and, germany, in, 1957, heisenberg, wrote, to, robert, jungk, who, was, then, working, on, the, book, brighter, than, a, thousand, suns, a, personal, history, of, the, atomic, scientists, heisenberg, explained, that, he, had, visited, copenhagen, to, communicate, to, bohr, the, views, of, several, german, scientists, that, production, of, a, nuclear, weapon, was, possible, with, great, efforts, and, this, raised, enormous, responsibilities, on, the, world, s, scientists, on, both, sides, when, bohr, saw, jungk, s, depiction, in, the, danish, translation, of, the, book, he, drafted, but, never, sent, a, letter, to, heisenberg, stating, that, he, deeply, disagreed, with, heisenberg, s, account, of, the, meeting, that, he, recalled, heisenberg, s, visit, as, being, to, encourage, cooperation, with, the, inevitably, victorious, nazis, and, that, he, was, shocked, that, germany, was, pursuing, nuclear, weapons, under, heisenberg, s, leadership, michael, frayn, s, 1998, play, copenhagen, explores, what, might, have, happened, at, the, 1941, meeting, between, heisenberg, and, bohr, a, television, film, version, of, the, play, by, the, bbc, was, first, screened, on, 26, september, 2002, with, stephen, rea, as, bohr, with, the, subsequent, release, of, bohr, s, letters, the, play, has, been, criticised, by, historians, as, being, a, grotesque, oversimplification, and, perversion, of, the, actual, moral, balance, due, to, adopting, a, pro, heisenberg, perspective, the, same, meeting, had, previously, been, dramatised, by, the, bbc, s, horizon, science, documentary, series, in, 1992, with, anthony, bate, as, bohr, and, philip, anthony, as, heisenberg, the, meeting, is, also, dramatized, in, the, norwegian, danish, british, miniseries, the, heavy, water, war, in, september, 1943, word, reached, bohr, and, his, brother, harald, that, the, nazis, considered, their, family, to, be, jewish, since, their, mother, was, jewish, and, that, they, were, therefore, in, danger, of, being, arrested, the, danish, resistance, helped, bohr, and, his, wife, escape, by, sea, to, sweden, on, 29, september, the, next, day, bohr, persuaded, king, gustaf, v, of, sweden, to, make, public, sweden, s, willingness, to, provide, asylum, to, jewish, refugees, on, 2, october, 1943, swedish, radio, broadcast, that, sweden, was, ready, to, offer, asylum, and, the, mass, rescue, of, the, danish, jews, by, their, countrymen, followed, swiftly, thereafter, some, historians, claim, that, bohr, s, actions, led, directly, to, the, mass, rescue, while, others, say, that, though, bohr, did, all, that, he, could, for, his, countrymen, his, actions, were, not, a, decisive, influence, on, the, wider, events, eventually, over, 7, 000, danish, jews, escaped, to, sweden, when, the, news, of, bohr, s, escape, reached, britain, lord, cherwell, sent, a, telegram, to, bohr, asking, him, to, come, to, britain, bohr, arrived, in, scotland, on, 6, october, in, a, de, havilland, mosquito, operated, by, the, british, overseas, airways, corporation, boac, the, mosquitos, were, unarmed, high, speed, bomber, aircraft, that, had, been, converted, to, carry, small, valuable, cargoes, or, important, passengers, by, flying, at, high, speed, and, high, altitude, they, could, cross, german, occupied, norway, and, yet, avoid, german, fighters, bohr, equipped, with, parachute, flying, suit, and, oxygen, mask, spent, the, three, hour, flight, lying, on, a, mattress, in, the, aircraft, s, bomb, bay, during, the, flight, bohr, did, not, wear, his, flying, helmet, as, it, was, too, small, and, consequently, did, not, hear, the, pilot, s, intercom, instruction, to, turn, on, his, oxygen, supply, when, the, aircraft, climbed, to, high, altitude, to, overfly, norway, he, passed, out, from, oxygen, starvation, and, only, revived, when, the, aircraft, descended, to, lower, altitude, over, the, north, sea, bohr, s, son, aage, followed, his, father, to, britain, on, another, flight, a, week, later, and, became, his, personal, assistant, bohr, was, warmly, received, by, james, chadwick, and, sir, john, anderson, but, for, security, reasons, bohr, was, kept, out, of, sight, he, was, given, an, apartment, at, st, james, s, palace, and, an, office, with, the, british, tube, alloys, nuclear, weapons, development, team, bohr, was, astonished, at, the, amount, of, progress, that, had, been, made, chadwick, arranged, for, bohr, to, visit, the, united, states, as, a, tube, alloys, consultant, with, aage, as, his, assistant, on, 8, december, 1943, bohr, arrived, in, washington, d, c, where, he, met, with, the, director, of, the, manhattan, project, brigadier, general, leslie, r, groves, jr, he, visited, einstein, and, pauli, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, and, went, to, los, alamos, in, new, mexico, where, the, nuclear, weapons, were, being, designed, for, security, reasons, he, went, under, the, name, of, nicholas, baker, in, the, united, states, while, aage, became, james, baker, in, may, 1944, the, danish, resistance, newspaper, de, frie, danske, reported, that, they, had, learned, that, the, famous, son, of, denmark, professor, niels, bohr, in, october, the, previous, year, had, fled, his, country, via, sweden, to, london, and, from, there, travelled, to, moscow, from, where, he, could, be, assumed, to, support, the, war, effort, bohr, did, not, remain, at, los, alamos, but, paid, a, series, of, extended, visits, over, the, course, of, the, next, two, years, robert, oppenheimer, credited, bohr, with, acting, as, a, scientific, father, figure, to, the, younger, men, most, notably, richard, feynman, bohr, is, quoted, as, saying, they, didn, t, need, my, help, in, making, the, atom, bomb, oppenheimer, gave, bohr, credit, for, an, important, contribution, to, the, work, on, modulated, neutron, initiators, this, device, remained, a, stubborn, puzzle, oppenheimer, noted, but, in, early, february, 1945, niels, bohr, clarified, what, had, to, be, done, bohr, recognised, early, that, nuclear, weapons, would, change, international, relations, in, april, 1944, he, received, a, letter, from, peter, kapitza, written, some, months, before, when, bohr, was, in, sweden, inviting, him, to, come, to, the, soviet, union, the, letter, convinced, bohr, that, the, soviets, were, aware, of, the, anglo, american, project, and, would, strive, to, catch, up, he, sent, kapitza, a, non, committal, response, which, he, showed, to, the, authorities, in, britain, before, posting, bohr, met, churchill, on, 16, may, 1944, but, found, that, we, did, not, speak, the, same, language, churchill, disagreed, with, the, idea, of, openness, towards, the, russians, to, the, point, that, he, wrote, in, a, letter, it, seems, to, me, bohr, ought, to, be, confined, or, at, any, rate, made, to, see, that, he, is, very, near, the, edge, of, mortal, crimes, oppenheimer, suggested, that, bohr, visit, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, to, convince, him, that, the, manhattan, project, should, be, shared, with, the, soviets, in, the, hope, of, speeding, up, its, results, bohr, s, friend, supreme, court, justice, felix, frankfurter, informed, president, roosevelt, about, bohr, s, opinions, and, a, meeting, between, them, took, place, on, 26, august, 1944, roosevelt, suggested, that, bohr, return, to, the, united, kingdom, to, try, to, win, british, approval, when, churchill, and, roosevelt, met, at, hyde, park, on, 19, september, 1944, they, rejected, the, idea, of, informing, the, world, about, the, project, and, the, aide, m, moire, of, their, conversation, contained, a, rider, that, enquiries, should, be, made, regarding, the, activities, of, professor, bohr, and, steps, taken, to, ensure, that, he, is, responsible, for, no, leakage, of, information, particularly, to, the, russians, in, june, 1950, bohr, addressed, an, open, letter, to, the, united, nations, calling, for, international, cooperation, on, nuclear, energy, in, the, 1950s, after, the, soviet, union, s, first, nuclear, weapon, test, the, international, atomic, energy, agency, was, created, along, the, lines, of, bohr, s, suggestion, in, 1957, he, received, the, first, ever, atoms, for, peace, award, following, the, ending, of, the, war, bohr, returned, to, copenhagen, on, 25, august, 1945, and, was, re, elected, president, of, the, royal, danish, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, on, 21, september, at, a, memorial, meeting, of, the, academy, on, 17, october, 1947, for, king, christian, x, who, had, died, in, april, the, new, king, frederik, ix, announced, that, he, was, conferring, the, order, of, the, elephant, on, bohr, this, award, was, normally, awarded, only, to, royalty, and, heads, of, state, but, the, king, said, that, it, honoured, not, just, bohr, personally, but, danish, science, bohr, designed, his, own, coat, of, arms, which, featured, a, taijitu, symbol, of, yin, and, yang, and, a, motto, in, latin, contraria, sunt, complementa, opposites, are, complementary, the, second, world, war, demonstrated, that, science, and, physics, in, particular, now, required, considerable, financial, and, material, resources, to, avoid, a, brain, drain, to, the, united, states, twelve, european, countries, banded, together, to, create, cern, a, research, organisation, along, the, lines, of, the, national, laboratories, in, the, united, states, designed, to, undertake, big, science, projects, beyond, the, resources, of, any, one, of, them, alone, questions, soon, arose, regarding, the, best, location, for, the, facilities, bohr, and, kramers, felt, that, the, institute, in, copenhagen, would, be, the, ideal, site, pierre, auger, who, organised, the, preliminary, discussions, disagreed, he, felt, that, both, bohr, and, his, institute, were, past, their, prime, and, that, bohr, s, presence, would, overshadow, others, after, a, long, debate, bohr, pledged, his, support, to, cern, in, february, 1952, and, geneva, was, chosen, as, the, site, in, october, the, cern, theory, group, was, based, in, copenhagen, until, their, new, accommodation, in, geneva, was, ready, in, 1957, victor, weisskopf, who, later, became, the, director, general, of, cern, summed, up, bohr, s, role, saying, that, there, were, other, personalities, who, started, and, conceived, the, idea, of, cern, the, enthusiasm, and, ideas, of, the, other, people, would, not, have, been, enough, however, if, a, man, of, his, stature, had, not, supported, it, meanwhile, scandinavian, countries, formed, the, nordic, institute, for, theoretical, physics, in, 1957, with, bohr, as, its, chairman, he, was, also, involved, with, the, founding, of, the, research, establishment, ris, of, the, danish, atomic, energy, commission, and, served, as, its, first, chairman, from, february, 1956, bohr, died, of, heart, failure, at, his, home, in, carlsberg, on, 18, november, 1962, he, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, were, buried, in, the, family, plot, in, the, assistens, cemetery, in, the, n, rrebro, section, of, copenhagen, along, with, those, of, his, parents, his, brother, harald, and, his, son, christian, years, later, his, wife, s, ashes, were, also, interred, there, on, 7, october, 1965, on, what, would, have, been, his, 80th, birthday, the, institute, for, theoretical, physics, at, the, university, of, copenhagen, was, officially, renamed, to, what, it, had, been, called, unofficially, for, many, years, the, niels, bohr, institute, bohr, received, numerous, honours, and, accolades, in, addition, to, the, nobel, prize, he, received, the, hughes, medal, in, 1921, the, matteucci, medal, in, 1923, the, franklin, medal, in, 1926, the, copley, medal, in, 1938, the, order, of, the, elephant, in, 1947, the, atoms, for, peace, award, in, 1957, and, the, sonning, prize, in, 1961, he, became, foreign, member, of, the, finnish, society, of, sciences, an, letters, in, 1922, and, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1923, an, international, member, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1925, a, member, of, the, royal, society, in, 1926, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1940, and, an, international, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1945, the, bohr, model, s, semicentennial, was, commemorated, in, denmark, on, 21, november, 1963, with, a, postage, stamp, depicting, bohr, the, hydrogen, atom, and, the, formula, for, the, difference, of, any, two, hydrogen, energy, levels, h, 2, 1, displaystyle, h, nu, epsilon, 2, epsilon, 1, several, other, countries, have, also, issued, postage, stamps, depicting, bohr, in, 1997, the, danish, national, bank, began, circulating, the, 500, krone, banknote, with, the, portrait, of, bohr, smoking, a, pipe, on, 7, october, 2012, in, celebration, of, niels, bohr, s, 127th, birthday, a, google, doodle, depicting, the, bohr, model, of, the, hydrogen, atom, appeared, on, google, s, home, page, an, asteroid, 3948, bohr, was, named, after, him, as, was, the, bohr, lunar, crater, and, bohrium, the, chemical, element, with, atomic, number, 107
