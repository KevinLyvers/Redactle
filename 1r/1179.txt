of, canon, law, and, leo, ix, enthusiastically, introduced, their, ideas, to, rome, he, prohibited, simony, the, sale, of, church, offices, and, promoted, clerical, celibacy, imperial, control, of, church, affairs, was, in, the, long, run, incompatible, with, the, reformist, idea, of, liberty, of, the, church, which, claimed, that, ecclesiastic, institutions, could, only, be, subject, to, the,

relatives, but, sooner, or, later, they, had, no, choice, but, to, fill, vacant, duchies, because, they, depended, on, the, most, powerful, aristocrats, support, henry, iii, came, into, conflict, with, influential, dukes, towards, the, end, of, his, life, godfrey, the, bearded, duke, of, upper, lotharingia, married, a, wealthy, widow, margravine, beatrice, of, tuscany, without, the, emperor,

them, with, swabian, soldiers, like, his, father, henry, spent, more, time, in, saxony, than, in, other, parts, of, germany, and, the, accommodation, of, his, retinue, was, the, saxons, irksome, duty, the, thuringians, were, also, outraged, that, henry, supported, archbishop, siegfried, of, mainz, s, claim, to, collect, tithes, from, them, although, most, thuringians, had, been, exempted, from, the, church, tax, for, centuries, the, margrave, of, lower, lusatia, dedi, i, was, the, first, saxon, lord, to, rebel, he, claimed, benefices, that, his, wife, s, former, husband, otto, i, margrave, of, meissen, had, held, but, henry, refused, him, in, 1069, dedi, approached, the, thuringians, for, help, but, after, henry, s, promise, to, confirm, their, exemption, from, tithes, the, thuringians, joined, the, royal, army, henry, invaded, dedi, s, domains, and, forced, him, to, surrender, otto, of, nordheim, held, vast, estates, in, saxony, after, a, nobleman, egeno, accused, him, of, plotting, against, henry, s, life, otto, was, summoned, to, purge, himself, of, that, charge, in, single, combat, early, in, august, 1070, the, contemporary, historian, bruno, the, saxon, stated, that, henry, had, paid, egeno, to, accuse, otto, but, his, account, is, biased, fearing, his, case, would, not, be, judged, fairly, otto, disobeyed, the, summons, and, fled, from, bavaria, to, saxony, he, was,

henry, to, release, otto, of, nordheim, in, may, 1072, but, magnus, of, saxony, remained, imprisoned, before, long, adalbert, died, and, henry, seized, his, treasury, an, early, example, of, the, application, of, the, jus, spolii, by, a, german, monarch, henry, started, appointing, low, ranking, men, to, royal, offices, in, the, whole, kingdom, and, this, practice, outraged, the, german, aristocrats, rudolf, of, rheinfelden, and, berthold, of, z, hringen, returned, to, their, duchies, from, the, royal, court, and, rumours, accusing, them, of, plotting, against, the, king, spread, in, germany, rudolf, appealed, to, agnes, of, poitou, asking, her, to, reconcile, him, with, her, son, agnes, who, had, moved, to, rome, in, 1065, returned, to, germany, and, mediated, a, reconciliation, in, july, 1072, it, proved, temporary, because, henry, did, not, dismiss, his, advisors, agnes, shared, the, dukes, negative, views, of, henry, s, advisors, and, persuaded, pope, alexander, to, excommunicate, at, least, five, of, them, in, february, 1073, though, henry, did, not, sever, ties, with, them, appointments, to, the, highest, church, offices, remained, crucial, elements, of, henry, s, authority, the, practice, enabled, him, to, demand, benefices, for, his, supporters, from, the, wealthy, bishops, and, abbots, but, the, reformist, clergy, condemned, it, as, simony, when, henry, appointed, a, milanese, nobleman, gotofredo, to, the, archbishopric, of, milan, in, 1070, pope, alexander, ii, excommunicated, the, new, archbishop, henry, obtained, gotofredo, s, consecration, however, which, brought, him, into, a, prolonged, conflict, with, the, holy, see, the, bishopric, of, constance, became, another, source, of, conflict, in, 1070, after, the, local, clerics, appealed, to, the, holy, see, to, prevent, the, installation, of, henry, s, candidate, charles, of, magdeburg, to, the, episcopal, see, henry, denied, charles, had, bribed, him, but, he, publicly, admitted, at, a, synod, that, his, advisors, may, have, received, money, from, charles, pope, alexander, ii, decided, to, investigate, and, summoned, all, german, bishops, who, had, been, accused, of, simony, or, corruption, to, rome, but, he, died, in, two, months, the, romans, proclaimed, hildebrand, as, his, successor, on, 22, april, 1073, hildebrand, who, assumed, the, name, gregory, vii, did, not, seek, confirmation, from, henry, he, did, not, challenge, henry, s, prerogatives, but, he, was, convinced, a, monarch, who, had, regular, contacts, with, excommunicated, people, could, not, intervene, in, church, affairs, he, regarded, lay, investiture, as, the, principal, barrier, to, completing, the, reform, of, the, church, and, challenged, royal, appointments, taking, advantage, of, individual, complaints, against, german, prelates, henry, s, italian, chancellor, bishop, gregory, of, vercelli, and, an, assembly, of, the, german, bishops, urged, the, king, to, declare, gregory, s, election, invalid, because, he, had, been, proclaimed, pope, by, the, romans, instead, of, being, elected, by, the, cardinals, the, german, dukes, and, godfrey, the, bearded, s, influential, widow, beatrice, of, tuscany, convinced, henry, that, he, should, cooperate, with, the, pope, boles, aw, ii, duke, of, poland, invaded, bohemia, in, early, 1073, and, henry, decided, to, launch, a, punitive, action, against, him, he, ordered, the, saxon, aristocrats, to, assemble, at, goslar, where, on, 29, june, they, asked, henry, to, redress, their, grievances, henry, made, no, concessions, and, withdrew,

the, saxons, grievances, but, he, was, determined, to, crush, the, revolt, a, month, later, henry, s, servant, regenger, informed, rudolf, and, berthold, that, henry, was, planning, to, murder, them, regenger, was, ready, to, prove, his, words, in, a, judicial, duel, but, he, died, unexpectedly, in, january, 1074, his, statements, however, deepened, the, conflict, between, the, king, and, the, two, dukes, henry, who, had, just, recovered, from, an, illness, moved, to, worms, the, local, bishop, adalbert, denied, his, entry, but, the, townspeople, rose, up, against, the, bishop, and, surrendered, worms, to, henry, a, grateful, henry, exempted, the, burghers, from, customs, duties, emphasising, their, loyalty, in, a, time, when, all, the, princes, of, the, realm, were, raging, against, him, liemar, archbishop, of, bremen, udo, archbishop, of, trier, and, eight, bishops, came, to, visit, henry, in, worms, in, early, 1074, their, retainers, and, the, worms, militia, joined,

local, bishop, william, i, was, the, only, prelate, willing, to, excommunicate, the, pope, henry, wanted, to, demonstrate, that, the, pope, s, denial, of, the, monarchs, role, in, the, administration,

conrad, captured, but, he, escaped, to, milan, according, to, bernold, of, constance, henry, tried, to, commit, suicide, after, his, son, s, rebellion, though, bernold, probably, invented, this,

scholars, have, regarded, her, statements, as, an, effective, propaganda, tool, against, henry, likely, fabricated, by, matilda, s, advisors, the, pope, departed, from, piacenza, to, france, in, triumph, but, the, teenage, welf, the, fat, left, his, middle, aged, wife, around, the, same, time, the, separation, of, matilda, and, her, husband, came, as, a, severe, blow, to, the, pope, because,

authority, was, quickly, waning, his, son, took, advantage, of, frederick, of, b, ren, s, death, to, take, control, of, swabia, leopold, iii, margrave, of, austria, and, bo, ivoj, ii, duke, of, bohemia, deserted, the, emperor, at, regensburg, in, late, september, though, bo, ivoj, soon, repented, his, betrayal, and, supported, henry, s, flight, from, regensburg, to, saxony, his, brother, in, law, count, wiprecht, of, groitzsch, accompanied, henry, as, far, as, mainz, in, late, october, already, in, despair, henry, sent, a, letter, to, his, son, asking, him, not, to, persist, in, his, desire, to, depose, him, from, the, kingship, the, younger, henry, wanted, no, compromise, henry, moved, from, mainz, to, hammerstein, and, then, to, cologne, he, decided, to, return, to, mainz, because, he, wanted, to, defend, himself, at, the, german, princes, assembly, his, son, had, convoked, the, younger, henry, met, with, his, father, at, koblenz, on, 21, december, henry, dismissed, his, retinue, because, his, son, promised, a, safe, conduct, to, mainz, instead, he, was, captured, and, brought, to, the, castle, of, b, ckelheim, where, he, was, forced, to, cede, the, royal, insignia, to, his, son, the, burghers, of, mainz, remained, loyal, to, henry, so, his, son, summoned, the, german, princes, instead, to, an, assembly, at, ingelheim, henry, was, allowed, to, attend, the, meeting, but, it, was, dominated, by, his, enemies, having, no, other, choice, he, abdicated, in, his, son, s, favour, on, 31, december, later, he, said, he, resigned, only, because, of, his, fears, of, imminent, murder, or, execution, henry, was, staying, in, ingelheim, after, his, abdication, but, his, supporters, warned, him, his, son, had, decided, to, imprison, or, execute, him, in, early, february, 1106, he, fled, to, cologne, where, he, was, received, by, the, townspeople, with, great, respect, he, declined, all, ceremonies, demonstrating, that, he, was, doing, penance, for, his, sins, his, loyal, supporter, othbert, bishop, of, li, ge, made, peace, with, henry, of, limburg, to, secure, the, duke, s, support, henry, joined, them, at, li, ge, and, mediated, a, reconciliation, between, henry, of, limburg, and, albert, iii, count, of, namur, robert, ii, of, flanders, also, promised, him, assistance, henry, addressed, a, letter, to, hugh, of, cluny, offering, to, accept, all, his, terms, in, return, for, an, absolution, he, also, wrote, letters, to, his, son, the, german, princes, and, king, philip, i, of, france, all, of, them, show, he, was, determined, to, regain, his, throne, henry, v, invaded, lorraine, but, his, father, s, supporters, routed, his, army, at, vis, on, 22, march, 1106, henry, of, limburg, and, the, burghers, of, cologne, and, li, ge, jointly, persuaded, the, elderly, henry, to, resume, the, office, of, emperor, henry, v, laid, siege, to, cologne, early, in, july, but, had, to, withdraw, from, the, well, fortified, town, three, or, four, weeks, later, the, deposed, emperor, sent, letters, to, the, german, princes, accusing, his, son, of, treachery, and, hypocrisy, he, fell, unexpectedly, ill, and, died, in, li, ge, on, 7, august, on, his, deathbed, he, asked, his, son, to, pardon, his, supporters, and, to, have, him, buried, next, to, his, ancestors, in, speyer, cathedral, bishop, othbert, buried, henry, in, li, ge, cathedral, but, the, excommunicated, emperor, s, body, could, not, rest, in, a, consecrated, place, eight, days, later, his, corpse, was, unearthed, and, buried, in, an, unconsecrated, chapel, near, li, ge, on, 24, august, his, son, ordered, a, new, exhumation, because, he, wanted, to, execute, henry, s, last, will, the, townspeople, of, li, ge, tried, to, prevent, the, transfer, of, henry, s, corpse, but, it, was, carried, in, a, sarcophagus, to, speyer, the, sarcophagus, was, placed, in, an, unconsecrated, chapel, of, the, speyer, cathedral, on, 3, september, five, years, later, pope, paschal, ii, granted, permission, to, the, younger, henry, to, bury, his, father, as, he, had, requested, henry, iv, was, buried, next, to, henry, iii, in, the, cathedral, on, 7, august, 1111, henry, s, conflicts, with, his, subjects, both, sons, his, wives, and, with, the, popes, gave, rise, to, a, rich, polemical, literature, during, his, lifetime, both, his, supporters, and, his, opponents, based, their, portraits, of, henry, on, two, early, medieval, works, the, twelve, abuses, contained, a, discussion, about, legitimate, kingship, while, isidore, of, seville, s, etymologiae, contrasted, kingship, with, tyranny, consequently, polemical, literature, tended, to, provide, a, list, of, the, characteristics, of, either, good, or, wicked, rulers, when, portraying, henry, for, instance, in, the, 1080s, the, song, of, the, saxon, war, praised, him, as, a, king, second, to, none, in, his, piety, who, defended, the, widows, and, the, poor, and, gave, laws, to, the, lawless, saxons, the, vita, heinrici, iv, imperatoris, an, anonymous, biography, completed, in, the, early, 1110s, described, him, as, a, vigorous, and, warlike, monarch, who, employed, learned, officials, and, enjoyed, conversations, about, spiritual, themes, and, the, liberal, arts, in, contrast, lambert, of, hersfeld, stated, henry, had, inherited, a, peaceful, realm, but, he, rendered, it, filthy, despicable, bloodstained, a, prey, to, internal, conflicts, lambert, also, emphasised, that, henry, destroyed, and, robbed, churches, and, put, freemen, into, servitude, rumours, of, henry, s, immorality, established, his, bad, reputation, for, centuries, the, saxons, were, the, first, to, accuse, him, of, debauchery, and, demanded, he, dismiss, the, swarm, of, concubines, with, whom, he, slept, polemical, writings, spreading, in, germany, after, 1085, accused, henry, of, incest, and, pederasty, also, claiming, that, he, had, fathered, illegitimate, children, isidore, of, seville, listed, immoral, sexual, practices, among, the, tyrants, characteristics, consequently, as, robinson, emphasises, allegations, of, henry, s, alleged, sexual, misconduct, provided, his, opponents, with, a, useful, polemical, weapon, henry, was, not, a, successful, military, commander, primarily, because, he, did, not, avoid, pitched, battles, in, contrast, with, most, 11th, century, military, leaders, he, could, likely, adopt, this, high, risk, strategy, because, he, often, mustered, his, troops, from, among, merchants, and, peasants, who, were, regarded, as, expendable, he, lost, most, of, his, major, battles, his, sole, victory, at, homburg, was, primarily, attributed, to, rudolf, of, rheinfelden, by, their, contemporaries, on, the, other, hand, henry, s, adaptability, and, openness, to, compromise, and, his, preference, for, dilatory, tactics, enabled, him, to, survive, most, crises, of, his, reign, henry, s, penitential, walk, to, canossa, developed, into, a, powerful, metaphor, catholic, clerics, were, the, first, to, adopt, it, regarding, it, as, the, symbol, of, the, triumph, of, the, holy, see, over, an, immoral, monarch, for, 19th, century, protestant, german, nationalists, the, gang, nach, canossa, road, to, canossa, symbolized, the, humiliation, of, germany, by, a, haughty, pope, otto, von, bismarck, proudly, declared, before, the, reichstag, that, don, t, worry, we, are, not, going, to, canossa, neither, physically, nor, spiritually, during, his, campaign, against, political, catholicism, on, 14, may, 1872, historians, have, adopted, more, sophisticated, approaches, they, emphasize, that, penance, and, reconciliation, were, integral, parts, of, medieval, life, so, an, anointed, king, s, excommunication, was, more, disturbing, for, henry, s, contemporaries, than, his, act, of, penance, at, canossa, henry, as, schutz, concludes, cleverly, maneuvered, the, pope, into, a, position, in, which, he, had, to, absolve, him, but, gregory, vii, reduced, him, from, vicar, of, christ, to, being, a, mere, layman, henry, s, death, did, not, put, an, end, to, the, investiture, controversy, a, renowned, french, lawyer, bishop, ivo, of, chartres, and, his, pupil, hugh, of, fleury, had, paved, the, road, to, a, compromise, already, in, henry, s, lifetime, they, actually, adopted, an, old, view, condemned, by, reformist, clerics, making, a, distinction, between, the, secular, possessions, and, properties, of, bishoprics, and, abbeys, temporalities, and, the, ecclesiastical, authority, and, sacramental, powers, of, the, bishops, and, abbots, spiritualities, in, 1122, henry, v, and, pope, calixtus, ii, included, a, similar, distinction, in, their, concordat, of, worms, whereby, the, emperor, renounced, the, right, to, install, the, prelates, in, their, ecclesiastical, offices, with, ring, and, staff, in, return, for, the, right, to, invest, them, with, their, secular, possessions, using, the, sceptre, however, the, german, monarchs, right, to, acquire, a, dead, prelate, s, treasury, introduced, by, henry, remained, an, important, source, of, wealth, especially, during, the, reigns, of, frederick, barbarossa, and, henry, vi, in, the, second, half, of, the, 12th, century, henry, s, first, wife, bertha, of, savoy, was, a, year, younger, than, he, until, 5, august, 1068, henry, regularly, mentioned, her, as, consort, of, our, kingdom, and, our, marriage, bed, in, his, diplomas, her, disappearance, from, the, diplomas, was, the, sign, of, a, growing, disaffection, henry, sought, a, divorce, at, a, general, assembly, in, june, 1069, stating, their, marriage, had, not, been, consummated, the, assembled, german, aristocrats, referred, his, request, to, a, synod, which, passed, the, matter, to, the, holy, see, in, early, october, pope, alexander, ii, made, it, clear, henry, would, only, be, crowned, emperor, if, he, abandoned, his, plan, henry, obeyed, and, bertha, was, again, mentioned, regularly, in, his, diplomas, from, 26, october, 1069, she, died, on, 27, december, 1087, bertha, gave, birth, to, five, children, but, two, of, them, adelaide, and, henry, died, in, infancy, her, surviving, children, were, the, morkinskinna, the, earliest, icelandic, chronicle, of, the, norwegian, kings, refers, to, a, daughter, of, an, emperor, who, must, have, been, identical, with, henry, for, chronological, reasons, called, mathilde, according, to, this, source, magnus, iii, of, norway, exchanged, messages, with, her, and, also, composed, a, stanza, for, her, other, primary, sources, do, not, list, mathilde, among, henry, s, children, henry, s, second, wife, eupraxia, known, as, adelaide, in, germany, was, born, around, 1068, she, was, the, daughter, of, vsevolod, i, grand, prince, of, kiev, but, it, was, not, her, connection, to, kievan, rus, but, her, first, marriage, to, henry, of, stade, margrave, of, the, nordmark, that, made, her, an, ideal, spouse, for, henry, after, her, husband, died, in, 1087, henry, of, stade, had, been, a, wealthy, saxon, aristocrat, and, his, widow, s, marriage, to, henry, contributed, to, his, reconciliation, with, the, saxons, henry, and, eupraxia, were, engaged, in, 1088, in, contrast, with, bertha, eupraxia, was, mentioned, in, only, one, of, her, husband, s, diplomas, showing, that, she, never, gained, henry, s, confidence, after, the, scandalous, end, of, their, marriage, she, returned, to, kiev, where, she, died, on, 10, july, 1109, gunhilda, s, daughter, by, emperor, henry, iii, beatrix, is, not, displayed, she, was, abbess, of, quedlinburg, and, gandersheim, until, her, death, in, 1061
