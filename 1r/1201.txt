ture, and, sila, by, many, historians, however, stephan, b, hnen, has, argued, that, they, should, be, interpreted, as, nisba, s, referring, to, ancestry, from, futa, toro, or, silla, in, the, senegal, valley, and, favors, the, possibility, that, his, ancestors, originally, came, from, futa, toro, after, going, on, the, hajj, in, 1497, 1498, he, also, became, known, as, askia, al, hajj, muhammad, in, modern, songhai, he, is, known, as, mamar, kassey, mamar, is, a, form, of, the, name, muhammad, and, kassey, is, a, matronymic, the, theory, that, askia, muhammad, s, family, originated, in, futa, toro, is, controversial, and, has, been, generally, rejected, by, the, songhai, people, themselves, especially, by, muhammad, s, modern, descendants, who, see, in, it, a, challenge, to, their, ethnicity, his, exact, surname, has, not, been, definitively, determined, and, no, toucouleur, or, soninke, oral, source, claim, him, as, one, of, their, own, the, tarikh, al, fattash, uses,

because, the, post, of, general, was, only, given, to, a, member, of, the, royal, family, and, ethnic, songhai, patrilineally, the, theory, that, he, is, an, ethnic, songhai, through, both, his,
