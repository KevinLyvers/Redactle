went, on, to, become, one, of, the, most, venerated, intellectual, figures, in, islamic, history, who, has, had, a, profound, influence, affecting, almost, every, area, of, the, traditionalist, perspective, within, sunni, islam, one, of, the, foremost, classical, proponents, of, relying, on, scriptural, sources, as, the, basis, for, sunni, islamic, law, and, way, of, life, ibn, hanbal, compiled, one, of, the, most, significant, sunni, hadith, collections, al, musnad, which, has, continued, to, exercise, considerable, influence, on, the, field, of, hadith, studies, up, to, the, present, time, having, studied, jurisprudence, and, hadith, under, many, teachers, during, his, youth, ibn, hanbal, became, famous, in, his, later, life, for, the, crucial, role, he, played, in, the, mihna, instituted, by, the, abbasid, caliph, al, ma, mun, toward, the, end, of, his, reign, in, which, the, ruler, gave, official, state, support, to, the, mu, tazili, doctrine, of, the, quran, being, created, a, view, that, contradicted, the, orthodox, position, of, the, quran, being, the, eternal, uncreated, word, of, god, living, in, poverty, throughout, his, lifetime, working, as, a, baker, and, suffering, physical, persecution, under, the, caliphs, for, his, unflinching, adherence, to, the, traditional, doctrine, ibn, hanbal, s, fortitude, in, this, particular, event, only, bolstered, his, resounding, reputation, in, the, annals, of, sunni, history, ibn, hanbal, later, came, to, be, venerated, as, an, exemplary, figure, in, all, traditional, schools, of, sunni, thought, both, by, the, exoteric, scholars, and, ascetic, sufis, with, the, latter, often, designating, him, as, a, saint, in, their, hagiographies, the, 12th, century, jurist, and, theologian, ibn, al, jawzi, relates, he, was, the, foremost, in, collecting, the, prophetic, way, and, adhering, to, it, he, was, further, praised, by, the, 14th, century, historian, and, traditionist, al, dhahabi, who, referred, to, ibn, hanbal, as, the, true, shaykh, of, islam, and, imam, of, the, muslims, in, his, time, the, traditionist, and, proof, of, the, religion, in, the, modern, era, ibn, hanbal, s, name, has, become, controversial, in, certain, quarters, of, the, islamic, world, as, the, hanbali, reform, movement, known, as, wahhabism, has, cited, him, as, a, principal, influence, along, with, the, 13th, century, hanbali, reformer, ibn, taymiyya, however, it, has, been, argued, by, certain, scholars, that, ibn, hanbal, s, own, beliefs, actually, played, no, real, part, in, the, establishment, of, the, central, doctrines, of, wahhabism, as, there, is, evidence, according, to, the, same, authors, the, older, hanbali, authorities, had, doctrinal, concerns, very, different, from, those, of, the, wahhabis, due, to, medieval, hanbali, literature, being, rich, in, references, to, saints, grave, visitation, miracles, and, relics, in, this, connection, scholars, have, cited, ibn, hanbal, s, own, support, for, the, use, of, relics, as, one, of, several, important, points, on, which, the, theologian, s, positions, diverged, from, those, adhering, to, wahhabism, other, scholars, maintain, he, was, the, distant, progenitor, of, wahhabism, who, also, immensely, inspired, the, similar, conservative, reform, movement, of, salafism, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, was, born, in, the, month, of, rabi, al, awwal, in, the, year, 164, ah, november, 780, ce, this, was, mentioned, by, his, son, abdullah, abdullah, reported, i, heard, my, father, say, i, was, born, in, the, month, of, rabi, al, awwal, in, the, year, 164, ah, ibn, hanbal, s, family, was, originally, from, basra, and, belonged, to, the, arab, banu, dhuhl, tribe, his, father, was, an, officer, in, the, abbasid, army, in, khorasan, and, later, settled, with, his, family, in, baghdad, historians, differ, about, his, place, of, birth, some, say, he, was, said, that, he, was, born, in, merv, located, in, mary, turkmenistan, today, where, his, father, and, grandfather, had, also, previously, worked, while, according, to, others, he, was, born, in, baghdad, after, his, mother, came, pregnant, with, him, from, the, city, of, merv, where, his, father, was, the, latter, opinion, is, the, most, accepted, one, ibn, hanbal, lost, his, father, when, he, was, a, young, child, his, father, died, young, at, the, age, of, thirty, only, then, his, mother, raised, him, under, the, care, of, those, who, remained, from, his, father, s, family, his, father, had, left, him, a, property, in, baghdad, in, which, he, lived, and, another, which, yielded, him, a, small, rental, income, sufficient, for, his, living, the, reports, are, conflicting, about, whether, it, was, large, or, small, ibn, kathir, mentioned, its, amount, saying, his, income, from, his, property, was, seventeen, dirhams, each, month, which, he, spent, on, his, family, and, he, was, content, with, that, seeking, the, mercy, of, allah, patiently, and, seeking, reward, it, is, also, narrated, that, a, man, asked, imam, ahmad, about, the, property, he, was, using, on, which, he, made, a, house, on, he, replied, this, is, something, i, inherited, from, my, father, if, a, man, comes, to, me, and, confirms, that, this, is, his, i, will, get, rid, of, it, and, give, it, to, him, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, did, not, marry, until, he, reached, the, age, of, forty, it, is, said, that, this, was, because, he, was, busy, with, knowledge, or, because, he, traveled, a, lot, and, was, away, from, his, country, for, a, long, time, when, he, reached, the, age, of, forty, and, became, closer, to, settling, down, than, before, and, he, thought, about, marriage, ibn, al, jawzi, said, about, this, he, may, god, be, pleased, with, him, was, very, keen, on, knowledge, he, traveled, far, in, search, of, it, and, spend, a, long, time, on, obtaining, it, he, did, not, occupy, himself, with, earning, or, marriage, until, he, achieved, what, he, wanted, from, it, his, first, wife, was, abbasah, bintul, fadl, an, arab, girl, from, the, suburbs, of, baghdad, and, she, lived, with, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, for, thirty, years, or, twenty, years, according, to, some, reports, and, bore, him, their, son, salih, and, hence, her, she, was, known, by, her, title, ummu, salih, lit, mother, of, salih, ibn, hanbal, remarked, about, her, in, the, 30, or, 20, years, we, were, together, we, never, had, a, disagreement, after, her, demise, ahmad, married, his, second, wife, ummu, abdillah, rayhana, bintu, uma, known, simply, as, rayhana, and, she, bore, him, one, son, abdullah, she, known, for, having, only, one, eye, and, ibn, hanbal, married, her, because, he, was, impressed, by, her, religious, commitment, reports, suggest, that, they, were, together, for, seven, years, he, also, had, a, concubine, named, husn, who, bore, him, a, female, girl, zainab, then, twins, al, hasan, and, al, hussein, who, died, after, their, birth, then, she, bore, al, hasan, and, muhammad, and, then, she, bored, him, saeed, among, his, sons, salih, and, abdullah, excelled, in, jurisprudence, while, saeed, later, became, the, judge, of, kufa, ibn, hanbal, studied, extensively, in, baghdad, and, later, traveled, to, further, his, education, he, started, learning, jurisprudence, under, the, celebrated, judge, of, hanafi, jurisprudence, abu, yusuf, who, was, the, student, and, companion, of, abu, hanifa, after, completing, his, studies, with, him, ibn, hanbal, began, traveling, throughout, arabia, to, collect, narrations, of, muhammad, ibn, al, jawzi, stated, ibn, hanbal, had, 414, traditionists, whom, he, narrated, from, with, this, knowledge, he, became, a, leading, authority, in, the, field, leaving, behind, an, immense, encyclopedia, of, narrations, al, musnad, after, several, years, of, travel, he, returned, to, baghdad, to, study, islamic, law, under, al, shafi, i, with, whom, he, formed, a, close, bond, with, ibn, hanbal, became, a, judge, in, his, old, age, through, his, students, the, hanbali, school, of, jurisprudence, was, established, which, is, now, most, dominant, in, saudi, arabia, and, qatar, unlike, the, other, three, schools, hanafi, maliki, and, shafi, i, the, hanbali, school, remained, largely, athari, in, its, theology, in, addition, to, his, scholastic, enterprises, ibn, hanbal, was, a, soldier, in, the, war, frontiers, and, performed, pilgrimage, five, times, in, his, life, twice, on, foot, ibn, hanbal, is, known, to, have, been, called, before, the, mihna, of, the, abbasid, caliph, al, ma, mun, who, wanted, to, assert, his, religious, authority, by, pressuring, scholars, to, adopt, the, mu, tazili, doctrine, of, the, quran, being, created, rather, than, uncreated, according, to, sunni, tradition, ibn, hanbal, was, one, of, the, foremost, scholars, in, resisting, the, caliph, s, interference, and, his, imposed, doctrine, ibn, hanbal, s, stance, led, to, the, hanbali, school, establishing, itself, firmly, as, not, only, a, school, of, jurisprudence, but, theology, as, well, because, of, ibn, hanbal, s, refusal, to, accept, the, mu, tazili, doctrine, he, was, imprisoned, in, baghdad, throughout, the, reign, of, al, ma, mun, in, an, incident, during, the, rule, of, al, ma, mun, s, successor, al, mu, tasim, ibn, hanbal, was, flogged, to, unconsciousness, however, this, caused, great, upheaval, in, baghdad, and, forced, al, mu, tasim, to, release, him, after, al, mu, tasim, s, death, al, wathiq, became, caliph, and, continued, his, predecessors, policies, of, enforcing, the, mu, tazili, doctrine, and, in, this, pursuit, banished, ibn, hanbal, from, baghdad, it, was, only, after, al, wathiq, s, death, and, the, ascent, of, his, brother, al, mutawakkil, who, was, much, more, tolerating, of, the, traditional, sunni, beliefs, that, ibn, hanbal, was, welcomed, back, to, baghdad, his, appearance, according, to, siyar, a, lam, al, nubala, is, ibn, dharih, al, ukbari, said, i, requested, to, see, ahmad, bin, hanbal, so, i, greeted, him, and, he, was, an, old, man, who, dyed, his, hair, he, was, tall, and, extremely, dark, muhammad, bin, abbas, an, nahwi, said, i, saw, ahmad, bin, hanbal, with, a, handsome, face, well, formed, and, he, dyed, his, hair, with, henna, that, was, not, too, dark, he, had, black, hairs, in, his, beard, and, i, saw, his, clothes, extremely, white, when, i, saw, him, he, was, wearing, a, turban, and, an, izar, abd, al, malik, al, maymuni, said, i, do, not, know, that, i, have, ever, seen, anyone, who, wore, cleaner, clothes, was, more, attentive, to, trimming, his, moustache, and, grooming, the, hair, on, his, head, and, body, or, wore, purer, and, whiter, garments, than, ahmad, bin, hanbal, he, died, due, to, being, severely, ill, his, son, salih, describes, his, illness, as, on, the, first, day, of, the, month, of, rabi, al, awwal, in, the, year, two, hundred, and, forty, one, my, father, had, a, fever, on, wednesday, night, i, went, to, him, on, wednesday, while, he, was, feverish, and, breathing, heavily, i, had, known, his, illness, and, i, used, to, nurse, him, when, he, was, sick, i, said, to, him, o, father, how, did, you, break, your, fast, last, night, he, said, with, water, and, broad, beans, then, he, wanted, to, get, up, so, he, said, take, my, hand, so, i, took, his, hand, when, he, went, to, the, toilet, his, legs, weakened, until, he, leaned, on, me, other, than, doctors, all, were, muslims, a, doctor, called, abd, al, rahman, prescribed, for, him, a, gourd, that, was, roasted, and, its, water, given, to, drink, this, was, on, tuesday, and, he, died, on, friday, ibn, hanbal, died, on, friday, 2, august, 855, 12, rabi, al, awwal, 241, ah, at, the, age, of, 74, 75, in, baghdad, historians, relate, his, funeral, was, attended, by, 800, 000, men, and, 60, 000, women, and, 20, 000, christians, and, jews, converted, to, islam, on, that, day, his, grave, is, located, in, the, premises, of, the, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, mosque, in, al, rusafa, district, ibn, hanbal, s, principal, doctrine, is, what, later, came, to, be, known, as, traditionalist, thought, which, emphasized, the, acceptance, of, only, the, quran, and, hadith, as, the, foundations, of, orthodox, belief, he, did, however, believe, that, it, was, only, a, select, few, who, were, properly, authorized, to, interpret, the, sacred, texts, ibn, hanbal, understood, the, perfect, definition, of, god, to, be, that, given, in, the, quran, whence, he, held, that, proper, belief, in, god, constituted, believing, in, the, description, which, god, had, given, of, himself, in, the, islamic, scripture, to, begin, with, ibn, hanbal, asserted, that, god, was, both, unique, and, absolute, and, absolutely, incomparable, to, anything, in, the, world, of, his, creatures, as, for, the, various, divine, attributes, ibn, hanbal, believed, that, all, the, regular, attributes, of, god, such, as, hearing, sight, speech, omnipotence, will, wisdom, the, vision, by, the, believers, on, the, day, of, resurrection, etc, were, to, be, literally, affirmed, as, realities, aqq, as, for, those, attributes, called, ambiguous, mutas, h, bih, such, as, those, which, spoke, of, god, s, hand, face, throne, and, omnipresence, vision, by, the, believers, on, the, day, of, resurrection, etc, they, were, to, be, understood, in, the, same, manner, ibn, hanbal, treated, those, verses, in, the, scriptures, with, apparently, anthropomorphic, descriptions, as, muhkamat, clear, verses, admitting, to, only, a, literal, meaning, furthermore, ibn, hanbal, rejected, the, negative, theology, ta, l, of, the, jahmiyya, and, their, particular, allegorizing, exegesis, ta, w, l, of, the, quran, and, of, tradition, and, no, less, emphatically, criticized, the, anthropomorphism, tas, h, b, h, of, the, mus, h, abbiha, amongst, whom, he, included, in, the, scope, of, his, polemics, the, jahmiyya, as, unconscious, anthropomorphists, ibn, hanbal, was, also, a, critic, of, overt, and, unnecessary, speculation, in, matters, of, theology, he, believed, that, it, was, fair, to, worship, god, without, the, mode, of, the, theologoumena, bil, kayf, and, felt, it, was, wise, to, leave, to, god, the, understanding, of, his, own, mystery, thus, ibn, hanbal, became, a, strong, proponent, of, the, bi, l, kayfa, formula, this, mediating, principle, allowed, the, traditionalists, to, deny, ta, wil, figurative, interpretations, of, the, apparently, anthropomorphic, texts, while, concomitantly, affirming, the, doctrine, of, the, incorporeal, transcendent, deity, although, he, argued, for, literalist, meanings, of, the, qur, anic, and, prophetic, statements, about, god, ibn, hanbal, was, not, a, fideist, and, was, willing, to, engage, in, hermeneutical, exercises, the, rise, of, imam, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, and, the, ashab, al, hadith, whose, cause, he, championed, during, the, mihna, would, mark, the, stage, for, the, empowerment, and, centering, of, corporealist, ideas, in, the, sunnite, orthodoxy, ibn, hanbal, also, recognized, divine, form, al, rah, as, a, true, attribute, of, god, he, disagreed, with, those, speculative, theologians, who, interpreted, the, divine, form, as, something, that, represents, pseudo, divinities, such, as, the, sun, moon, stars, etc, for, ibn, hanbal, to, deny, that, god, truly, has, a, form, is, kufr, disbelief, he, also, believed, that, god, created, adam, according, to, his, form, censuring, those, who, alleged, that, this, was, referring, to, the, form, of, adam, ibn, hanbal, asserted, he, who, says, that, allah, created, adam, according, to, the, form, of, adam, he, is, a, jahmi, disbeliever, which, form, did, adam, have, before, he, created, him, one, of, ibn, hanbal, s, most, famous, contributions, to, sunni, thought, was, the, considerable, role, he, played, in, bolstering, the, orthodox, doctrine, of, the, quran, being, the, uncreated, word, of, god, kal, m, all, h, g, h, ayr, mak, h, l, by, quran, ibn, hanbal, understood, not, just, an, abstract, idea, but, the, quran, with, its, letters, words, expressions, and, ideas, the, quran, in, all, its, living, reality, whose, nature, in, itself, according, to, ibn, hanbal, eluded, human, comprehension, ibn, hanbal, favoured, independent, reasoning, ijtihad, and, rejected, blind, following, taqlid, his, staunch, condemnation, of, taqlid, is, reported, in, the, treatise, fath, al, majid, by, hanbali, judge, abd, al, rahman, ibn, hasan, 1782, 1868, comparing, taqlid, to, polytheism, shirk, ibn, hanbal, states, i, am, amazed, at, those, people, who, know, that, a, chain, of, narration, is, authentic, and, yet, in, spite, of, this, they, follow, the, opinion, of, sufyan, for, god, says, and, let, those, who, oppose, the, messenger, s, commandment, beware, lest, some, fitna, should, befall, them, or, a, painful, torment, be, inflicted, on, them, do, you, know, what, that, fitna, is, that, fitna, is, shirk, maybe, the, rejection, of, some, of, his, words, would, cause, one, to, doubt, and, deviate, in, his, heart, and, thereby, be, destroyed, it, is, narrated, by, ab, bakr, al, marwaz, in, his, mansak, that, ibn, hanbal, preferred, one, to, make, tawassul, or, intercession, through, muhammad, in, every, supplication, with, the, wording, o, god, i, am, turning, to, thee, with, thy, prophet, the, prophet, of, mercy, o, muhammad, i, am, turning, with, you, to, my, lord, for, the, fulfillment, of, my, need, this, report, is, repeated, in, many, later, hanbali, works, in, the, context, of, personal, supplication, as, an, issue, of, jurisprudence, ibn, qudamah, for, example, recommends, it, for, the, obtainment, of, need, in, his, wasiyya, in, the, same, way, ibn, taymiyyah, cites, the, hanbali, fatwa, on, the, desirability, of, muhammad, s, intercession, in, every, personal, supplication, in, his, q, ida, fil, tawassul, wal, wasi, la, where, he, attributes, it, to, im, m, ahmad, and, a, group, of, the, pious, ancestors, from, the, mansak, of, al, marwaz, as, his, source, as, there, exist, historical, sources, indicating, patently, mystical, elements, in, his, personal, piety, and, documented, evidence, of, his, amiable, interactions, with, numerous, early, sufi, saints, including, maruf, karkhi, it, is, recognized, that, ibn, hanbal, s, relationship, with, many, of, the, sufis, was, one, of, mutual, respect, and, admiration, qadi, abu, ya, la, reports, in, his, tabaqat, used, to, greatly, respect, the, s, f, s, and, show, them, kindness, and, generosity, he, was, asked, about, them, and, was, told, that, they, sat, in, mosques, constantly, to, which, he, replied, knowledge, made, them, sit, furthermore, it, is, in, ibn, hanbal, s, musnad, that, we, find, most, of, the, hadith, reports, concerning, the, abdal, forty, major, saints, whose, number, would, remain, constant, one, always, being, replaced, by, some, other, on, his, death, and, whose, key, role, in, the, traditional, sufi, conception, of, the, celestial, hierarchy, would, be, detailed, by, later, mystics, such, as, hujwiri, and, ibn, arabi, it, has, been, reported, that, ibn, hanbal, explicitly, identified, maruf, karkhi, as, one, of, the, abdal, saying, he, is, one, of, the, substitute, saints, and, his, supplication, is, answered, of, the, same, sufi, ibn, hanbal, later, asked, rhetorically, is, religious, knowledge, anything, else, than, what, maruf, has, achieved, additionally, there, are, accounts, of, ibn, hanbal, extolling, the, early, ascetic, saint, bishr, the, barefoot, and, his, sister, as, two, exceptional, devotees, of, god, and, of, his, sending, people, with, mystical, questions, to, bishr, for, guidance, it, is, also, recorded, that, ibn, hanbal, said, with, regard, to, the, early, sufis, i, do, not, know, of, any, people, better, than, them, moreover, there, are, accounts, of, ibn, hanbal, s, son, s, lih, being, exhorted, by, his, father, to, go, and, study, under, the, sufis, according, to, one, tradition, s, lih, said, my, father, would, send, for, me, whenever, a, self, denier, or, ascetic, z, hid, aw, mutaqashshif, visited, him, so, i, could, look, at, him, he, loved, for, me, to, become, like, this, as, for, the, sufis, reception, of, ibn, hanbal, it, is, evident, that, he, was, held, in, high, regard, by, all, the, major, sufis, of, the, classical, and, medieval, periods, and, later, sufi, chroniclers, often, designated, the, jurist, as, a, saint, in, their, hagiographies, praising, him, both, for, his, legal, work, and, for, his, appreciation, of, sufi, doctrine, hujwiri, for, example, wrote, of, him, he, was, distinguished, by, devoutness, and, piety, sufis, of, all, orders, regard, him, as, blessed, he, associated, with, great, shaykhs, such, as, dhul, nun, of, egypt, bishr, al, hafi, sari, al, saqati, maruf, karkhi, and, others, his, miracles, were, manifest, and, his, intelligence, sound, he, had, a, firm, belief, in, the, principles, of, religion, and, his, creed, was, approved, by, all, the, both, non, hanbali, and, hanbali, sufi, hagiographers, such, as, hujwiri, and, ibn, al, jawzi, respectively, also, alluded, to, ibn, hanbal, s, own, gifts, as, a, miracle, worker, and, of, the, blessedness, of, his, grave, for, example, ibn, hanbal, s, own, body, was, traditionally, held, to, have, been, blessed, with, the, miracle, of, incorruptibility, with, ibn, al, jawzi, relating, when, the, prophet, s, descendant, ab, ja, far, ibn, ab, m, s, was, buried, next, to, him, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, s, tomb, was, exposed, his, corpse, had, not, putrified, and, the, shroud, was, still, whole, and, undecayed, although, there, is, a, perception, that, ibn, hanbal, or, his, school, were, somehow, adverse, to, sufism, scholars, such, as, eric, geoffrey, have, asserted, that, this, opinion, is, more, partial, than, objective, for, there, is, no, proof, that, the, hanbali, school, sufism, in, itself, any, more, than, any, other, school, and, it, is, evident, that, during, the, first, centuries, some, major, sufis, followed, the, hanbalite, school, of, law, by, the, twelfth, century, the, relationship, between, hanbalism, and, sufism, was, so, close, that, one, of, the, most, prominent, hanbali, jurists, abdul, qadir, jilani, was, also, simultaneously, the, most, famous, sufi, of, his, era, and, the, tariqa, that, he, founded, the, qadiriyya, has, continued, to, remain, one, of, the, most, widespread, sufi, orders, up, until, the, present, day, even, later, hanbali, authors, who, were, famous, for, criticizing, some, of, the, deviances, of, certain, heterodox, sufi, orders, of, their, day, such, as, ibn, qudamah, ibn, al, jawzi, and, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, all, belonged, to, abdul, qadir, jilani, s, order, themselves, and, never, condemned, sufism, outright, as, has, been, noted, by, scholars, it, is, evident, that, ibn, hanbal, believed, in, the, power, of, relics, and, supported, the, seeking, of, blessing, through, them, in, religious, veneration, indeed, several, accounts, of, ibn, hanbal, s, life, relate, that, he, often, carried, a, purse, in, his, sleeve, containing, hairs, from, the, prophet, furthermore, ibn, al, jawzi, relates, a, tradition, narrated, by, ibn, hanbal, s, son, abdullah, ibn, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, who, recalled, his, father, s, devotion, towards, relics, thus, i, saw, my, father, take, one, of, the, prophet, s, hairs, place, it, over, his, mouth, and, kiss, it, i, may, have, seen, him, place, it, over, his, eyes, and, dip, it, in, water, and, then, drink, the, water, for, a, cure, in, the, same, way, ibn, hanbal, also, drunk, from, muhammad, s, bowl, technically, a, second, class, relic, in, order, to, seek, blessings, from, it, and, considered, touching, and, kissing, the, sacred, minbar, of, muhammad, for, blessings, a, permissible, and, pious, act, ibn, hanbal, later, ordered, that, he, be, buried, with, muhammad, s, hairs, he, possessed, one, on, each, eye, and, a, third, on, his, tongue, sufi, scholar, gibril, haddad, reports, from, al, dhahabi, that, ibn, hanbal, used, to, seek, blessings, from, the, relics, of, the, prophet, citing, the, aforementioned, report, of, ibn, hanbal, s, devotion, towards, muhammad, s, hair, al, dhahab, then, goes, onto, staunchly, criticize, whoever, finds, fault, with, the, practices, of, tabarruk, or, seeking, blessings, from, holy, relics, saying, where, is, the, quibbling, critic, of, im, m, ahmad, now, it, is, also, authentically, established, that, abd, all, h, asked, his, father, about, those, who, touch, the, pommel, of, muhammad, s, pulpit, and, touch, the, wall, of, his, room, and, he, said, i, do, not, see, any, harm, in, it, may, god, protect, us, and, you, from, the, opinion, of, the, dissenters, and, from, innovations, when, asked, by, his, son, abdullah, about, the, legitimacy, of, touching, and, kissing, muhammad, s, grave, in, medina, ibn, hanbal, is, said, to, have, approved, of, both, these, acts, as, being, permissible, according, to, sacred, law, according, to, hanbali, scholar, najm, al, din, tufi, d, 716, a, h, 1316, c, e, ahmad, ibn, hanbal, did, not, formulate, a, legal, theory, since, his, entire, concern, was, with, hadith, and, its, collection, more, than, a, century, after, ahmad, s, death, hanbali, legalism, would, emerge, as, a, distinct, school, due, to, the, efforts, of, jurists, like, abu, bakr, al, athram, d, 261, a, h, 874, c, e, harb, al, kirmani, d, 280, a, h, 893, c, e, abd, allah, ibn, ahmad, d, 290, a, h, 903, c, e, abu, bakr, al, khallal, d, 311, a, h, 923, c, e, etc, who, compiled, ahmad, s, various, legal, verdicts, ibn, hanbal, also, had, a, strict, criterion, for, ijtihad, or, independent, reasoning, in, matters, of, law, by, muftis, and, the, ulema, one, story, narrates, that, ibn, hanbal, was, asked, by, zakariyy, ibn, ya, y, al, ar, r, about, how, many, memorized, ad, ths, are, sufficient, for, someone, to, be, a, mufti, according, to, the, narrative, zakariyy, asked, are, one, hundred, thousand, sufficient, to, which, ibn, hanbal, responded, in, the, negative, with, zakariyy, asking, if, two, hundred, thousand, were, to, which, he, received, the, same, response, from, the, jurist, thus, zakariyy, kept, increasing, the, number, until, at, five, hundred, thousand, ibn, hanbal, said, i, hope, that, that, should, be, sufficient, as, a, result, it, has, been, argued, that, ibn, hanbal, disapproved, of, independent, reasoning, by, those, muftis, who, were, not, absolute, masters, in, law, and, jurisprudence, ibn, hanbal, narrated, from, mu, ammad, ibn, ya, y, al, qa, n, that, the, latter, said, if, someone, were, to, follow, every, rukh, a, that, is, in, the, ad, th, he, would, become, a, transgressor, f, siq, it, is, believed, that, he, quoted, this, on, account, of, the, vast, number, of, forged, traditions, of, muhammad, ibn, hanbal, appears, to, have, been, a, formidable, opponent, of, private, interpretation, and, actually, held, that, it, was, only, the, religious, scholars, who, were, qualified, to, properly, interpret, the, holy, texts, one, of, the, creeds, attributed, to, ibn, hanbal, opens, with, praise, be, to, god, who, in, every, age, and, interval, between, prophets, fatra, elevated, learned, men, possessing, excellent, qualities, who, call, upon, him, who, goes, astray, to, return, to, the, right, way, it, has, been, pointed, out, that, this, particular, creed, explicitly, opposes, the, use, of, personal, judgement, ra, y, of, jurisprudence, ibn, hanbal, was, praised, both, in, his, own, life, and, afterwards, for, his, serene, acceptance, of, juridicial, divergences, among, the, various, schools, of, islamic, law, according, to, later, notable, scholars, of, the, hanbali, school, like, ibn, aqil, and, ibn, taymiyyah, ibn, hanbal, considered, every, madhhab, correct, and, abhorred, that, a, jurist, insist, people, follow, his, even, if, he, considered, them, wrong, and, even, if, the, truth, is, one, in, any, given, matter, as, such, when, ibn, hanbal, s, student, ish, q, ibn, bahl, l, al, anb, r, had, compiled, a, book, on, juridicial, differences, which, he, had, named, the, core, of, divergence, lub, b, al, ikhtil, f, ibn, hanbal, advised, him, to, name, the, work, the, book, of, leeway, kit, b, al, sa, a, instead, the, following, books, are, found, in, ibn, al, nadim, s, fihrist, ibn, hanbal, has, been, extensively, praised, for, both, his, work, in, the, field, of, prophetic, tradition, hadith, jurisprudence, and, his, defense, of, orthodox, sunni, theology, abdul, qadir, gilani, stated, that, a, muslim, could, not, truly, be, a, wali, of, allah, except, that, they, were, upon, ibn, hanbal, s, creed, despite, praise, from, his, contemporaries, as, well, yahya, ibn, ma, in, noted, that, ibn, hanbal, never, boasted, about, his, achievements, there, have, some, alleged, views, that, his, juristic, views, were, not, always, accepted, qur, anic, exegete, muhammad, ibn, jarir, al, tabari, who, at, one, time, had, sought, to, study, under, ibn, hanbal, later, stated, that, he, did, not, consider, ibn, hanbal, a, jurist, and, gave, his, views, in, the, field, no, weight, describing, him, as, an, expert, in, prophetic, tradition, only, however, this, must, be, seen, in, context, of, its, time, as, ibn, hanbal, s, school, was, still, at, its, infancy, and, not, followed, by, so, many, people, yet, compared, to, the, other, schools, and, the, students, had, conflict, with, al, tabari, s, school, consider, how, the, masa, il, of, imam, ahmad, i, e, the, first, written, compilation, of, ibn, hanbal, s, question, and, answers, was, written, by, abu, bakr, al, khallal, who, lived, around, the, same, time, as, al, tabari, and, the, first, written, compilation, of, ibn, hanbal, s, fiqh, was, al, khiraqi, who, also, lived, around, that, same, time, the, more, systematic, teaching, of, ibn, hanbal, s, jurisprudence, in, education, facilities, only, occurred, after, that, point, likewise, some, consider, how, the, andalusian, scholar, ibn, abd, al, barr, did, not, include, ibn, hanbal, or, his, views, in, his, book, the, hand, picked, excellent, merits, of, the, three, great, jurisprudent, im, ms, about, the, main, representatives, of, sunni, jurisprudence, however, ibn, abd, al, barr, actually, has, praised, ibn, hanbal, s, jurisprudence, by, saying, he, is, very, powerful, in, the, fiqh, of, the, madhab, of, the, ahl, al, hadith, and, he, is, the, imam, of, the, ulama, of, ahl, al, hadith, be, that, as, it, may, the, vast, majority, of, other, scholars, do, recognize, ibn, hanbal, s, prowess, as, a, master, jurist, worthy, of, one, whose, methodology, became, foundation, for, its, own, school, of, jurisprudence, imam, shafi, i, said, among, many, other, praises, ahmad, is, an, imam, in, eight, fields, he, is, an, imam, in, hadith, jurisprudence, al, qur, an, al, lughah, al, sunnah, al, zuhd, al, warak, and, al, faqr, al, dhahabi, one, of, the, most, major, islamic, biographers, notes, in, his, masterpiece, siyar, a, lam, nubala, that, ibn, hanbal, s, status, in, jurisprudence, is, alike, al, layth, ibn, sa, d, malik, ibn, anas, al, shafi, i, and, abu, yusuf, muhammad, abu, zahra, a, contemporary, hanafi, scholar, wrote, a, book, titled, ibn, hanbal, hayatuhu, wa, asruhu, ara, uhu, wa, fiqhuh, and, there, he, mentioned, the, heavy, praises, of, various, other, classical, scholars, towards, ibn, hanbal, and, his, school, of, jurisprudence, it, is, reported, that, ibn, hanbal, has, reached, the, title, of, al, hafidh, of, hadith, according, to, jamal, al, din, al, mizzi, classification, as, the, title, bestowment, were, approved, by, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, that, ibn, hanbal, has, memorized, at, least, 750, 000, hadith, during, his, life, more, than, muhammad, al, bukhari, and, muslim, ibn, al, hajjaj, who, each, memorized, 300, 000, hadith, and, abu, dawud, al, sijistani, who, memorized, 500, 000, hadith, abu, zur, ah, mentions, that, ibn, hanbal, has, memorized, 1, 000, 000, hadith, 700, 000, among, them, are, related, to, jurisprudence, while, according, to, the, classification, from, marfu, hadith, of, ibn, abbas, which, recorded, by, al, tabarani, ibn, hanbal, has, reached, the, rank, of, amir, al, mu, minin, al, hadith, a, rank, that, only, reached, by, very, few, hadith, scholars, in, history, such, as, malik, ibn, anas, yahya, ibn, ma, in, hammad, ibn, salamah, ibn, al, mubarak, and, al, suyuti, ibn, hanbal, s, musnad, is, not, however, ranked, among, the, kutub, al, sittah, the, six, big, collections, of, hadith
