referred, to, as, the, forgotten, citizen, or, neglected, citizen, by, declaring, remember, that, people, do, not, start, at, the, age, of, twenty, at, ten, or, at, six, but, at, birth, in, your, efforts, at, solving, problems, do, not, forget, that, children, and, young, people, make, up, a, vast, population, a, population, without, rights, which, is, being, crucified, on, school, benches, everywhere, which, for, all, that, we, talk, about, democracy, freedom, and, human, rights, is, enslaved, by, a, school, order, by, intellectual, rules, which, we, impose, on, it, we, define, the, rules, which, are, to, be, learnt, how, they, should, be, learnt, and, at, what, age, the, child, population, is, the, only, population, without, rights, the, child, is, the, neglected, citizen, think, of, this, and, fear, the, revenge, of, this, populace, for, it, is, his, soul, that, we, are, suffocating, it, is, the, lively, powers, of, the, mind, that, we, are, oppressing, powers, which, cannot, be, destroyed, without, killing, the, individual, powers, which, tend, either, towards, violence, or, destruction, or, slip, away, into, the, realm, of, sickness, as, dr, stern, has, so, well,

montessori, s, theory, and, philosophy, of, education, were, initially, heavily, influenced, by, the, work, of, jean, marc, gaspard, itard, douard, s, guin, friedrich, fr, bel, and, johann, heinrich, pestalozzi, all, of, whom, emphasized, sensory, exploration, and, manipulatives, montessori, s, first, work, with, children, with, learning, difficulties, at, the, orthophrenic, school, in, 1900, 1901, used, the, methods, of, itard, and, s, guin, training, children, in, physical, activities, such, as, walking, and, the, use, of, a, spoon, training, their, senses, by, exposure, to, sights, smells, and, tactile, experiences, and, introducing, letters, in, tactile, form, these, activities, developed, into, the, montessori, sensorial, materials, montessori, considered, her, work, in, the, orthophrenic, school, and, her, subsequent, psychological, studies, and, research, work, in, elementary, schools, as, scientific, pedagogy, a, concept, current, in, the, study, of, education, at, the, time, she, called, for, not, just, observation, and, measurement, of, students, but, for, the, development, of, new, methods, which, would, transform, them, scientific, education, therefore, was, that, which, while, based, on, science, modified, and, improved, the, individual, further, education, itself, should, be, transformed, by, science, the, new, methods, if, they, were, run, on, scientific, lines, ought, to, change, completely, both, the, school, and, its, methods, ought, to, give, rise, to, a, new, form, of, education, working, with, non, disabled, children, in, the, casa, dei, bambini, in, 1907, montessori, began, to, develop, her, own, pedagogy, the, essential, elements, of, her, educational, theory, emerged, from, this, work, described, in, the, montessori, method, in, 1912, and, in, the, discovery, of, the, child, in, 1948, her, method, was, founded, on, the, observation, of, children, at, liberty, to, act, freely, in, an, environment, prepared, to, meet, their, needs, montessori, came, to, the, conclusion, that, the, children, s, spontaneous, activity, in, this, environment, revealed, an, internal, program, of, development, and, that, the, appropriate, role, of, the, educator, was, to, remove, obstacles, to, this, natural, development, and, provide, opportunities, for, it, to, proceed, and, flourish, accordingly, the, schoolroom, was, equipped, with, child, sized, furnishings, practical, life, activities, such, as, sweeping, and, washing, tables, and, teaching, material, that, montessori, had, developed, herself, children, were, given, the, freedom, to, choose, and, carry, out, their, own, activities, at, their, own, pace, and, following, their, own, inclinations, in, these, conditions, montessori, made, a, number, of, observations, which, became, the, foundation, of, her, work, first, she, observed, great, concentration, in, the, children, and, spontaneous, repetition, of, chosen, activities, she, also, observed, a, strong, tendency, in, the, children, to, order, their, own, environment, straightening, tables, and, shelves, and, ordering, materials, as, children, chose, some, activities, over, others, montessori, refined, the, materials, she, offered, to, them, over, time, the, children, began, to, exhibit, what, she, called, spontaneous, discipline, montessori, continued, to, develop, her, pedagogy, and, her, model, of, human, development, as, she, expanded, her, work, and, extended, it, to, older, children, she, saw, human, behavior, as, guided, by, universal, innate, characteristics, in, human, psychology, which, her, son, and, collaborator, mario, m, montessori, sr, identified, as, human, tendencies, in, 1957, in, addition, she, observed, four, distinct, periods, or, planes, in,

modes, and, developmental, imperatives, active, in, each, of, these, planes, and, called, for, educational, approaches, specific, to, each, period, over, the, course, of, her, lifetime, montessori,
