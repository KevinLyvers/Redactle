john, dalton, frs, d, l, t, n, 5, or, 6, september, 1766, 27, july, 1844, was, an, english, chemist, physicist, and, meteorologist, he, introduced, the, atomic, theory, into, chemistry, he, also, researched, colour, blindness, as, a, result, the, umbrella, term, for, red, green, congenital, colour, blindness, disorders, is, daltonism, in, several, languages, john, dalton, was, born, on, 5, or, 6, september, 1766, into, a, quaker, family, in, eaglesfield, near, cockermouth, in, cumberland, england, his, father, was, a, weaver, he, received, his, early, education, from, his, father, and, from, quaker, john, fletcher, who, ran, a, private, school, in, the, nearby, village, of, pardshaw, hall, dalton, s, family, was, too, poor, to, support, him, for, long, and, he, began, to, earn, his, living, from, the, age, of, ten, in, the, service, of, wealthy, local, quaker, elihu, robinson, when, he, was, 15, dalton, joined, his, older, brother, jonathan, in, running, a, quaker, school, in, kendal, westmorland, about, 45, miles, 72, km, from, his, home, around, the, age, of, 23, dalton, may, have, considered, studying, law, or, medicine, but, his, relatives, did, not, encourage, him, perhaps, because, being, a, dissenter, he, was, barred, from, attending, english, universities, he, acquired, much, scientific, knowledge, from, informal, instruction, by, john, gough, a, blind, philosopher, who, was, gifted, in, the, sciences, and, arts, at, 27, he, was, appointed, teacher, of, mathematics, and, natural, philosophy, at, the, manchester, academy, in, manchester, a, dissenting, academy, the, lineal, predecessor, following, a, number, of, changes, of, location, of, harris, manchester, college, oxford, he, remained, for, seven, years, until, the, college, s, worsening, financial, situation, led, to, his, resignation, dalton, began, a, new, career, as, a, private, tutor, in, the, same, two, subjects, dalton, s, early, life, was, influenced, by, a, prominent, quaker, elihu, robinson, a, competent, meteorologist, and, instrument, maker, from, eaglesfield, cumberland, who, interested, him, in, problems, of, mathematics, and, meteorology, during, his, years, in, kendal, dalton, contributed, solutions, to, problems, and, answered, questions, on, various, subjects, in, the, ladies, diary, and, the, gentleman, s, diary, in, 1787, at, age, 21, he, began, his, meteorological, diary, in, which, during, the, succeeding, 57, years, he, entered, more, than, 200, 000, observations, he, rediscovered, george, hadley, s, theory, of, atmospheric, circulation, now, known, as, the, hadley, cell, around, this, time, in, 1793, dalton, s, first, publication, meteorological, observations, and, essays, contained, the, seeds, of, several, of, his, later, discoveries, but, despite, the, originality, of, his, treatment, little, attention, was, paid, to, them, by, other, scholars, a, second, work, by, dalton, elements, of, english, grammar, or, a, new, system, of, grammatical, instruction, for, the, use, of, schools, and, academies, was, published, in, 1801, after, leaving, the, lake, district, dalton, returned, annually, to, spend, his, holidays, studying, meteorology, something, which, involved, a, lot, of, hill, walking, until, the, advent, of, aeroplanes, and, weather, balloons, the, only, way, to, make, measurements, of, temperature, and, humidity, at, altitude, was, to, climb, a, mountain, dalton, estimated, the, height, using, a, barometer, the, ordnance, survey, did, not, publish, maps, for, the, lake, district, until, the, 1860s, before, then, dalton, was, one, of, the, few, authorities, on, the, heights, of, the, region, s, mountains, he, was, often, accompanied, by, jonathan, otley, who, also, made, a, study, of, the, heights, of, the, local, peaks, using, dalton, s, figures, as, a, comparison, to, check, his, work, otley, published, his, information, in, his, map, of, 1818, otley, became, both, an, assistant, and, a, friend, to, dalton, in, 1794, shortly, after, his, arrival, in, manchester, dalton, was, elected, a, member, of, the, manchester, literary, and, philosophical, society, the, lit, phil, and, a, few, weeks, later, he, communicated, his, first, paper, on, extraordinary, facts, relating, to, the, vision, of, colours, in, which, he, postulated, that, shortage, in, colour, perception, was, caused, by, discoloration, of, the, liquid, medium, of, the, eyeball, as, both, he, and, his, brother, were, colour, blind, he, recognised, that, the, condition, must, be, hereditary, although, dalton, s, theory, was, later, disproven, his, early, research, into, colour, vision, deficiency, was, recognized, after, his, lifetime, examination, of, his, preserved, eyeball, in, 1995, demonstrated, that, dalton, had, deuteranopia, a, type, of, congenital, red, green, color, blindness, in, which, the, gene, for, medium, wavelength, sensitive, green, photopsins, is, missing, individuals, with, this, form, of, colour, blindness, see, every, colour, as, mapped, to, blue, yellow, or, gray, or, as, dalton, wrote, in, his, seminal, paper, that, part, of, the, image, which, others, call, red, appears, to, me, little, more, than, a, shade, or, defect, of, light, after, that, the, orange, yellow, and, green, seem, one, colour, which, descends, pretty, uniformly, from, an, intense, to, a, rare, yellow, making, what, i, should, call, different, shades, of, yellow, in, 1800, dalton, became, secretary, of, the, manchester, literary, and, philosophical, society, and, in, the, following, year, he, presented, an, important, series, of, lectures, entitled, experimental, essays, on, the, constitution, of, mixed, gases, the, pressure, of, steam, and, other, vapours, at, different, temperatures, in, a, vacuum, and, in, air, on, evaporation, and, on, the, thermal, expansion, of, gases, the, four, essays, presented, between, 2, and, 30, october, 1801, were, published, in, the, memoirs, of, the, literary, and, philosophical, society, of, manchester, in, 1802, the, second, essay, opens, with, the, remark, there, can, scarcely, be, a, doubt, entertained, respecting, the, reducibility, of, all, elastic, fluids, of, whatever, kind, into, liquids, and, we, ought, not, to, despair, of, effecting, it, in, low, temperatures, and, by, strong, pressures, exerted, upon, the, unmixed, gases, further, after, describing, experiments, to, ascertain, the, pressure, of, steam, at, various, points, between, 0, and, 100, c, 32, and, 212, f, dalton, concluded, from, observations, of, the, vapour, pressure, of, six, different, liquids, that, the, variation, of, vapour, pressure, for, all, liquids, is, equivalent, for, the, same, variation, of, temperature, reckoning, from, vapour, of, any, given, pressure, in, the, fourth, essay, he, remarks, i, see, no, sufficient, reason, why, we, may, not, conclude, that, all, elastic, fluids, under, the, same, pressure, expand, equally, by, heat, and, that, for, any, given, expansion, of, mercury, the, corresponding, expansion, of, air, is, proportionally, something, less, the, higher, the, temperature, it, seems, therefore, that, general, laws, respecting, the, absolute, quantity, and, the, nature, of, heat, are, more, likely, to, be, derived, from, elastic, fluids, than, from, other, substances, he, enunciated, gay, lussac, s, law, published, in, 1802, by, joseph, louis, gay, lussac, gay, lussac, credited, the, discovery, to, unpublished, work, from, the, 1780s, by, jacques, charles, in, the, two, or, three, years, following, the, lectures, dalton, published, several, papers, on, similar, topics, on, the, absorption, of, gases, by, water, and, other, liquids, read, as, a, lecture, on, 21, october, 1803, first, published, in, 1805, contained, his, law, of, partial, pressures, now, known, as, dalton, s, law, arguably, the, most, important, of, all, dalton, s, investigations, are, concerned, with, the, atomic, theory, in, chemistry, while, his, name, is, inseparably, associated, with, this, theory, the, origin, of, dalton, s, atomic, theory, is, not, fully, understood, the, theory, may, have, been, suggested, to, him, either, by, researches, on, ethylene, olefiant, gas, and, methane, carburetted, hydrogen, or, by, analysis, of, nitrous, oxide, protoxide, of, azote, and, nitrogen, dioxide, deutoxide, of, azote, both, views, resting, on, the, authority, of, thomas, thomson, from, 1814, to, 1819, irish, chemist, william, higgins, claimed, that, dalton, had, plagiarised, his, ideas, but, higgins, theory, did, not, address, relative, atomic, mass, recent, evidence, suggests, that, dalton, s, development, of, thought, may, have, been, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, another, irish, chemist, bryan, higgins, who, was, william, s, uncle, bryan, believed, that, an, atom, was, a, heavy, central, particle, surrounded, by, an, atmosphere, of, caloric, the, supposed, substance, of, heat, at, the, time, the, size, of, the, atom, was, determined, by, the, diameter, of, the, caloric, atmosphere, based, on, the, evidence, dalton, was, aware, of, bryan, s, theory, and, adopted, very, similar, ideas, and, language, but, he, never, acknowledged, bryan, s, anticipation, of, his, caloric, model, however, the, essential, novelty, of, dalton, s, atomic, theory, is, that, he, provided, a, method, of, calculating, relative, atomic, weights, for, the, chemical, elements, which, provides, the, means, for, the, assignment, of, molecular, formulas, for, all, chemical, substances, neither, bryan, nor, william, higgins, did, this, and, dalton, s, priority, for, that, crucial, innovation, is, uncontested, a, study, of, dalton, s, laboratory, notebooks, discovered, in, the, rooms, of, the, manchester, literary, and, philosophical, society, concluded, that, so, far, from, dalton, being, led, by, his, search, for, an, explanation, of, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, to, the, idea, that, chemical, combination, consists, in, the, interaction, of, atoms, of, definite, and, characteristic, weight, the, idea, of, atoms, arose, in, his, mind, as, a, purely, physical, concept, forced, on, him, by, study, of, the, physical, properties, of, the, atmosphere, and, other, gases, the, first, published, indications, of, this, idea, are, to, be, found, at, the, end, of, his, paper, on, the, absorption, of, gases, by, water, and, other, liquids, already, mentioned, there, he, says, why, does, not, water, admit, its, bulk, of, every, kind, of, gas, alike, this, question, i, have, duly, considered, and, though, i, am, not, able, to, satisfy, myself, completely, i, am, nearly, persuaded, that, the, circumstance, depends, on, the, weight, and, number, of, the, ultimate, particles, of, the, several, gases, he, then, proposes, relative, weights, for, the, atoms, of, a, few, elements, without, going, into, further, detail, however, a, recent, study, of, dalton, s, laboratory, notebook, entries, concludes, he, developed, the, chemical, atomic, theory, in, 1803, to, reconcile, henry, cavendish, s, and, antoine, lavoisier, s, analytical, data, on, the, composition, of, nitric, acid, not, to, explain, the, solubility, of, gases, in, water, the, main, points, of, dalton, s, atomic, theory, as, it, eventually, developed, are, in, his, first, extended, published, discussion, of, the, atomic, theory, 1808, dalton, proposed, an, additional, and, controversial, rule, of, greatest, simplicity, this, rule, could, not, be, independently, confirmed, but, some, such, assumption, was, necessary, in, order, to, propose, formulas, for, a, few, simple, molecules, upon, which, the, calculation, of, atomic, weights, depended, this, rule, dictated, that, if, the, atoms, of, two, different, elements, were, known, to, form, only, a, single, compound, like, hydrogen, and, oxygen, forming, water, or, hydrogen, and, nitrogen, forming, ammonia, the, molecules, of, that, compound, shall, be, assumed, to, consist, of, one, atom, of, each, element, for, elements, that, combined, in, multiple, ratios, such, as, the, then, known, two, oxides, of, carbon, or, the, three, oxides, of, nitrogen, their, combinations, were, assumed, to, be, the, simplest, ones, possible, for, example, if, two, such, combinations, are, known, one, must, consist, of, an, atom, of, each, element, and, the, other, must, consist, of, one, atom, of, one, element, and, two, atoms, of, the, other, this, was, merely, an, assumption, derived, from, faith, in, the, simplicity, of, nature, no, evidence, was, then, available, to, scientists, to, deduce, how, many, atoms, of, each, element, combine, to, form, molecules, but, this, or, some, other, such, rule, was, absolutely, necessary, to, any, incipient, theory, since, one, needed, an, assumed, molecular, formula, in, order, to, calculate, relative, atomic, weights, dalton, s, rule, of, greatest, simplicity, caused, him, to, assume, that, the, formula, for, water, was, oh, and, ammonia, was, nh, quite, different, from, our, modern, understanding, h, 2, o, nh, 3, on, the, other, hand, his, simplicity, rule, led, him, to, propose, the, correct, modern, formulas, for, the, two, oxides, of, carbon, co, and, co, 2, despite, the, uncertainty, at, the, heart, of, dalton, s, atomic, theory, the, principles, of, the, theory, survived, dalton, published, his, first, table, of, relative, atomic, weights, containing, six, elements, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, carbon, sulfur, and, phosphorus, relative, to, the, weight, of, an, atom, of, hydrogen, conventionally, taken, as, 1, since, these, were, only, relative, weights, they, do, not, have, a, unit, of, weight, attached, to, them, dalton, provided, no, indication, in, this, paper, how, he, had, arrived, at, these, numbers, but, in, his, laboratory, notebook, dated, 6, september, 1803, is, a, list, in, which, he, set, out, the, relative, weights, of, the, atoms, of, a, number, of, elements, derived, from, analysis, of, water, ammonia, carbon, dioxide, etc, by, chemists, of, the, time, the, extension, of, this, idea, to, substances, in, general, necessarily, led, him, to, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, and, the, comparison, with, experiment, brilliantly, confirmed, his, deduction, in, the, paper, on, the, proportion, of, the, several, gases, in, the, atmosphere, read, by, him, in, november, 1802, the, law, of, multiple, proportions, appears, to, be, anticipated, in, the, words, the, elements, of, oxygen, may, combine, with, a, certain, portion, of, nitrous, gas, or, with, twice, that, portion, but, with, no, intermediate, quantity, but, there, is, reason, to, suspect, that, this, sentence, may, have, been, added, some, time, after, the, reading, of, the, paper, which, was, not, published, until, 1805, compounds, were, listed, as, binary, ternary, quaternary, etc, molecules, composed, of, two, three, four, etc, atoms, in, the, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, depending, on, the, number, of, atoms, a, compound, had, in, its, simplest, empirical, form, dalton, hypothesised, the, structure, of, compounds, can, be, represented, in, whole, number, ratios, so, one, atom, of, element, x, combining, with, one, atom, of, element, y, is, a, binary, compound, furthermore, one, atom, of, element, x, combining, with, two, atoms, of, element, y, or, vice, versa, is, a, ternary, compound, many, of, the, first, compounds, listed, in, the, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, correspond, to, modern, views, although, many, others, do, not, dalton, used, his, own, symbols, to, visually, represent, the, atomic, structure, of, compounds, they, were, depicted, in, the, new, system, of, chemical, philosophy, where, he, listed, 21, elements, and, 17, simple, molecules, dalton, published, papers, on, such, diverse, topics, as, rain, and, dew, and, the, origin, of, springs, hydrosphere, on, heat, the, colour, of, the, sky, steam, and, the, reflection, and, refraction, of, light, and, on, the, grammatical, subjects, of, the, auxiliary, verbs, and, participles, of, the, english, language, as, an, investigator, dalton, was, often, content, with, rough, and, inaccurate, instruments, even, though, better, ones, were, obtainable, sir, humphry, davy, described, him, as, a, very, coarse, experimenter, who, almost, always, found, the, results, he, required, trusting, to, his, head, rather, than, his, hands, on, the, other, hand, historians, who, have, replicated, some, of, his, crucial, experiments, have, confirmed, dalton, s, skill, and, precision, in, the, preface, to, the, second, part, of, volume, i, of, his, new, system, he, says, he, had, so, often, been, misled, by, taking, for, granted, the, results, of, others, that, he, determined, to, write, as, little, as, possible, but, what, i, can, attest, by, my, own, experience, but, this, independence, he, carried, so, far, that, it, sometimes, resembled, lack, of, receptivity, thus, he, distrusted, and, probably, never, fully, accepted, gay, lussac, s, conclusions, as, to, the, combining, volumes, of, gases, he, held, unconventional, views, on, chlorine, even, after, its, elementary, character, had, been, settled, by, davy, he, persisted, in, using, the, atomic, weights, he, himself, had, adopted, even, when, they, had, been, superseded, by, the, more, accurate, determinations, of, other, chemists, he, always, objected, to, the, chemical, notation, devised, by, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, although, most, thought, that, it, was, much, simpler, and, more, convenient, than, his, own, cumbersome, system, of, circular, symbols, for, rees, s, cyclop, dia, dalton, contributed, articles, on, chemistry, and, meteorology, but, the, topics, are, not, known, he, contributed, 117, memoirs, of, the, literary, and, philosophical, society, of, manchester, from, 1817, until, his, death, in, 1844, while, president, of, that, organisation, of, these, the, earlier, are, the, most, important, in, one, of, them, read, in, 1814, he, explains, the, principles, of, volumetric, analysis, in, which, he, was, one, of, the, earliest, researchers, in, 1840, a, paper, on, phosphates, and, arsenates, often, regarded, as, a, weaker, work, was, refused, by, the, royal, society, and, he, was, so, incensed, that, he, published, it, himself, he, took, the, same, course, soon, afterwards, with, four, other, papers, two, of, which, on, the, quantity, of, acids, bases, and, salts, in, different, varieties, of, salts, and, on, a, new, and, easy, method, of, analysing, sugar, contain, his, discovery, regarded, by, him, as, second, in, importance, only, to, atomic, theory, that, certain, anhydrates, when, dissolved, in, water, cause, no, increase, in, its, volume, his, inference, being, that, the, salt, enters, into, the, pores, of, the, water, even, before, he, had, propounded, the, atomic, theory, dalton, had, attained, a, considerable, scientific, reputation, in, 1803, he, was, chosen, to, give, a, series, of, lectures, on, natural, philosophy, at, the, royal, institution, in, london, and, he, delivered, another, series, of, lectures, there, in, 1809, 1810, some, witnesses, reported, that, he, was, deficient, in, the, qualities, that, make, an, attractive, lecturer, being, harsh, and, indistinct, in, voice, ineffective, in, the, treatment, of, his, subject, and, singularly, wanting, in, the, language, and, power, of, illustration, in, 1810, sir, humphry, davy, asked, him, to, offer, himself, as, a, candidate, for, the, fellowship, of, the, royal, society, but, dalton, declined, possibly, for, financial, reasons, in, 1822, he, was, proposed, without, his, knowledge, and, on, election, paid, the, usual, fee, six, years, previously, he, had, been, made, a, corresponding, member, of, the, french, acad, mie, des, sciences, and, in, 1830, he, was, elected, as, one, of, its, eight, foreign, associates, in, place, of, davy, in, 1833, earl, grey, s, government, conferred, on, him, a, pension, of, 150, raised, in, 1836, to, 300, equivalent, to, 17, 981, and, 35, 672, in, 2023, respectively, dalton, was, elected, a, foreign, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1834, a, young, james, prescott, joule, who, later, studied, and, published, 1843, on, the, nature, of, heat, and, its, relationship, to, mechanical, work, was, a, pupil, of, dalton, in, his, last, years, dalton, never, married, and, had, only, a, few, close, friends, as, a, quaker, he, lived, a, modest, and, unassuming, personal, life, for, the, 26, years, prior, to, his, death, dalton, lived, in, a, room, in, the, home, of, the, rev, w, johns, a, published, botanist, and, his, wife, in, george, street, manchester, dalton, and, johns, died, in, the, same, year, 1844, dalton, s, daily, round, of, laboratory, work, and, tutoring, in, manchester, was, broken, only, by, annual, excursions, to, the, lake, district, and, occasional, visits, to, london, in, 1822, he, paid, a, short, visit, to, paris, where, he, met, many, distinguished, resident, men, of, science, he, attended, several, of, the, earlier, meetings, of, the, british, association, at, york, oxford, dublin, and, bristol, dalton, suffered, a, minor, stroke, in, 1837, and, a, second, in, 1838, left, him, with, a, speech, impairment, although, he, remained, able, to, perform, experiments, in, may, 1844, he, had, another, stroke, on, 26, july, while, his, hand, was, trembling, he, recorded, his, last, meteorological, observation, on, 27, july, in, manchester, dalton, fell, from, his, bed, and, was, found, dead, by, his, attendant, dalton, was, accorded, a, civic, funeral, with, full, honours, his, body, lay, in, state, in, manchester, town, hall, for, four, days, and, more, than, 40, 000, people, filed, past, his, coffin, the, funeral, procession, included, representatives, of, the, city, s, major, civic, commercial, and, scientific, bodies, he, was, buried, in, manchester, in, ardwick, cemetery, the, cemetery, is, now, a, playing, field, but, pictures, of, the, original, grave, may, be, found, in, published, materials
