archimedes, of, syracuse, r, k, m, i, d, i, z, ar, kim, ee, deez, c, 287, c, 212, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, mathematician, physicist, engineer, astronomer, and, inventor, from, the, ancient, city, of, syracuse, in, sicily, although, few, details, of, his, life, are, known, he, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, leading, scientists, in, classical, antiquity, considered, the, greatest, mathematician, of, ancient, history, and, one, of, the, greatest, of, all, time, archimedes, anticipated, modern, calculus, and, analysis, by, applying, the, concept, of, the, infinitely, small, and, the, method, of, exhaustion, to, derive, and, rigorously, prove, a, range, of, geometrical, theorems, these, include, the, area, of, a, circle, the, surface, area, and, volume, of, a, sphere, the, area, of, an, ellipse, the, area, under, a, parabola, the, volume, of, a, segment, of, a, paraboloid, of, revolution, the, volume, of, a, segment, of, a, hyperboloid, of, revolution, and, the, area, of, a, spiral, archimedes, other, mathematical, achievements, include, deriving, an, approximation, of, pi, defining, and, investigating, the, archimedean, spiral, and, devising, a, system, using, exponentiation, for, expressing, very, large, numbers, he, was, also, one, of, the, first, to, apply, mathematics, to, physical, phenomena, working, on, statics, and, hydrostatics, archimedes, achievements, in, this, area, include, a, proof, of, the, law, of, the, lever, the, widespread, use, of, the, concept, of, center, of, gravity, and, the, enunciation, of, the, law, of, buoyancy, known, as, archimedes, principle, he, is, also, credited, with, designing, innovative, machines, such, as, his, screw, pump, compound, pulleys, and, defensive, war, machines, to, protect, his, native, syracuse, from, invasion, archimedes, died, during, the, siege, of, syracuse, when, he, was, killed, by, a, roman, soldier, despite, orders, that, he, should, not, be, harmed, cicero, describes, visiting, archimedes, tomb, which, was, surmounted, by, a, sphere, and, a, cylinder, that, archimedes, requested, be, placed, there, to, represent, his, mathematical, discoveries, unlike, his, inventions, archimedes, mathematical, writings, were, little, known, in, antiquity, mathematicians, from, alexandria, read, and, quoted, him, but, the, first, comprehensive, compilation, was, not, made, until, c, 530, ad, by, isidore, of, miletus, in, byzantine, constantinople, while, commentaries, on, the, works, of, archimedes, by, eutocius, in, the, 6th, century, opened, them, to, wider, readership, for, the, first, time, the, relatively, few, copies, of, archimedes, written, work, that, survived, through, the, middle, ages, were, an, influential, source, of, ideas, for, scientists, during, the, renaissance, and, again, in, the, 17th, century, while, the, discovery, in, 1906, of, previously, lost, works, by, archimedes, in, the, archimedes, palimpsest, has, provided, new, insights, into, how, he, obtained, mathematical, results, archimedes, was, born, c, 287, bc, in, the, seaport, city, of, syracuse, sicily, at, that, time, a, self, governing, colony, in, magna, graecia, the, date, of, birth, is, based, on, a, statement, by, the, byzantine, greek, scholar, john, tzetzes, that, archimedes, lived, for, 75, years, before, his, death, in, 212, bc, in, the, sand, reckoner, archimedes, gives, his, father, s, name, as, phidias, an, astronomer, about, whom, nothing, else, is, known, a, biography, of, archimedes, was, written, by, his, friend, heracleides, but, this, work, has, been, lost, leaving, the, details, of, his, life, obscure, it, is, unknown, for, instance, whether, he, ever, married, or, had, children, or, if, he, ever, visited, alexandria, egypt, during, his, youth, from, his, surviving, written, works, it, is, clear, that, he, maintained, collegial, relations, with, scholars, based, there, including, his, friend, conon, of, samos, and, the, head, librarian, eratosthenes, of, cyrene, the, standard, versions, of, archimedes, life, were, written, long, after, his, death, by, greek, and, roman, historians, the, earliest, reference, to, archimedes, occurs, in, the, histories, by, polybius, c, 200, 118, bc, written, about, 70, years, after, his, death, it, sheds, little, light, on, archimedes, as, a, person, and, focuses, on, the, war, machines, that, he, is, said, to, have, built, in, order, to, defend, the, city, from, the, romans, polybius, remarks, how, during, the, second, punic, war, syracuse, switched, allegiances, from, rome, to, carthage, resulting, in, a, military, campaign, under, the, command, of, marcus, claudius, marcellus, and, appius, claudius, pulcher, who, besieged, the, city, from, 213, to, 212, bc, he, notes, that, the, romans, underestimated, syracuse, s, defenses, and, mentions, several, machines, archimedes, designed, including, improved, catapults, crane, like, machines, that, could, be, swung, around, in, an, arc, and, other, stone, throwers, although, the, romans, ultimately, captured, the, city, they, suffered, considerable, losses, due, to, archimedes, inventiveness, cicero, 106, 43, bc, mentions, archimedes, in, some, of, his, works, while, serving, as, a, quaestor, in, sicily, cicero, found, what, was, presumed, to, be, archimedes, tomb, near, the, agrigentine, gate, in, syracuse, in, a, neglected, condition, and, overgrown, with, bushes, cicero, had, the, tomb, cleaned, up, and, was, able, to, see, the, carving, and, read, some, of, the, verses, that, had, been, added, as, an, inscription, the, tomb, carried, a, sculpture, illustrating, archimedes, favorite, mathematical, proof, that, the, volume, and, surface, area, of, the, sphere, are, two, thirds, that, of, an, enclosing, cylinder, including, its, bases, he, also, mentions, that, marcellus, brought, to, rome, two, planetariums, archimedes, built, the, roman, historian, livy, 59, bc, 17, ad, retells, polybius, s, story, of, the, capture, of, syracuse, and, archimedes, role, in, it, plutarch, 45, 119, ad, wrote, in, his, parallel, lives, that, archimedes, was, related, to, king, hiero, ii, the, ruler, of, syracuse, although, cicero, suggests, he, was, of, humble, origin, plutarch, also, provides, at, least, two, accounts, on, how, archimedes, died, after, the, city, was, taken, according, to, the, most, popular, account, archimedes, was, contemplating, a, mathematical, diagram, when, the, city, was, captured, a, roman, soldier, commanded, him, to, come, and, meet, marcellus, but, he, declined, saying, that, he, had, to, finish, working, on, the, problem, this, enraged, the, soldier, who, killed, archimedes, with, his, sword, another, story, has, archimedes, carrying, mathematical, instruments, before, being, killed, because, a, soldier, thought, they, were, valuable, items, marcellus, was, reportedly, angered, by, archimedes, death, as, he, considered, him, a, valuable, scientific, asset, he, called, archimedes, a, geometrical, briareus, and, had, ordered, that, he, should, not, be, harmed, the, last, words, attributed, to, archimedes, are, do, not, disturb, my, circles, latin, noli, turbare, circulos, meos, katharevousa, greek, a, reference, to, the, mathematical, drawing, that, he, was, supposedly, studying, when, disturbed, by, the, roman, soldier, there, is, no, reliable, evidence, that, archimedes, uttered, these, words, and, they, do, not, appear, in, plutarch, s, account, a, similar, quotation, is, found, in, the, work, of, valerius, maximus, fl, 30, ad, who, wrote, in, memorable, doings, and, sayings, sed, protecto, manibus, puluere, noli, inquit, obsecro, istum, disturbare, but, protecting, the, dust, with, his, hands, said, i, beg, of, you, do, not, disturb, this, the, most, widely, known, anecdote, about, archimedes, tells, of, how, he, invented, a, method, for, determining, the, volume, of, an, object, with, an, irregular, shape, according, to, vitruvius, a, crown, for, a, temple, had, been, made, for, king, hiero, ii, of, syracuse, who, supplied, the, pure, gold, to, be, used, the, crown, was, likely, made, in, the, shape, of, a, votive, wreath, archimedes, was, asked, to, determine, whether, some, silver, had, been, substituted, by, the, goldsmith, without, damaging, the, crown, so, he, could, not, melt, it, down, into, a, regularly, shaped, body, in, order, to, calculate, its, density, in, this, account, archimedes, noticed, while, taking, a, bath, that, the, level, of, the, water, in, the, tub, rose, as, he, got, in, and, realized, that, this, effect, could, be, used, to, determine, the, golden, crown, s, volume, archimedes, was, so, excited, by, this, discovery, that, he, took, to, the, streets, naked, having, forgotten, to, dress, crying, eureka, greek, he, r, ka, lit, i, have, found, for, practical, purposes, water, is, incompressible, so, the, submerged, crown, would, displace, an, amount, of, water, equal, to, its, own, volume, by, dividing, the, mass, of, the, crown, by, the, volume, of, water, displaced, its, density, could, be, obtained, if, cheaper, and, less, dense, metals, had, been, added, the, density, would, be, lower, than, that, of, gold, archimedes, found, that, this, is, what, had, happened, proving, that, silver, had, been, mixed, in, the, story, of, the, golden, crown, does, not, appear, anywhere, in, archimedes, known, works, the, practicality, of, the, method, described, has, been, called, into, question, due, to, the, extreme, accuracy, that, would, be, required, to, measure, water, displacement, archimedes, may, have, instead, sought, a, solution, that, applied, the, hydrostatics, principle, known, as, archimedes, principle, found, in, his, treatise, on, floating, bodies, a, body, immersed, in, a, fluid, experiences, a, buoyant, force, equal, to, the, weight, of, the, fluid, it, displaces, using, this, principle, it, would, have, been, possible, to, compare, the, density, of, the, crown, to, that, of, pure, gold, by, balancing, it, on, a, scale, with, a, pure, gold, reference, sample, of, the, same, weight, then, immersing, the, apparatus, in, water, the, difference, in, density, between, the, two, samples, would, cause, the, scale, to, tip, accordingly, galileo, galilei, who, invented, a, hydrostatic, balance, in, 1586, inspired, by, archimedes, work, considered, it, probable, that, this, method, is, the, same, that, archimedes, followed, since, besides, being, very, accurate, it, is, based, on, demonstrations, found, by, archimedes, himself, while, archimedes, did, not, invent, the, lever, he, gave, a, mathematical, proof, of, the, principle, involved, in, his, work, on, the, equilibrium, of, planes, earlier, descriptions, of, the, principle, of, the, lever, are, found, in, a, work, by, euclid, and, in, the, mechanical, problems, belonging, to, the, peripatetic, school, of, the, followers, of, aristotle, the, authorship, of, which, has, been, attributed, by, some, to, archytas, there, are, several, often, conflicting, reports, regarding, archimedes, feats, using, the, lever, to, lift, very, heavy, objects, plutarch, describes, how, archimedes, designed, block, and, tackle, pulley, systems, allowing, sailors, to, use, the, principle, of, leverage, to, lift, objects, that, would, otherwise, have, been, too, heavy, to, move, according, to, pappus, of, alexandria, archimedes, work, on, levers, and, his, understanding, of, mechanical, advantage, caused, him, to, remark, give, me, a, place, to, stand, on, and, i, will, move, the, earth, greek, olympiodorus, later, attributed, the, same, boast, to, archimedes, invention, of, the, baroulkos, a, kind, of, windlass, rather, than, the, lever, a, large, part, of, archimedes, work, in, engineering, probably, arose, from, fulfilling, the, needs, of, his, home, city, of, syracuse, athenaeus, of, naucratis, quotes, a, certain, moschion, in, a, description, on, how, king, hiero, ii, commissioned, the, design, of, a, huge, ship, the, syracusia, which, could, be, used, for, luxury, travel, carrying, supplies, and, as, a, display, of, naval, power, the, syracusia, is, said, to, have, been, the, largest, ship, built, in, classical, antiquity, and, according, to, moschion, s, account, it, was, launched, by, archimedes, the, ship, presumably, was, capable, of, carrying, 600, people, and, included, garden, decorations, a, gymnasium, and, a, temple, dedicated, to, the, goddess, aphrodite, among, its, facilities, the, account, also, mentions, that, in, order, to, remove, any, potential, water, leaking, through, the, hull, a, device, with, a, revolving, screw, shaped, blade, inside, a, cylinder, was, designed, by, archimedes, archimedes, screw, was, turned, by, hand, and, could, also, be, used, to, transfer, water, from, a, low, lying, body, of, water, into, irrigation, canals, the, screw, is, still, in, use, today, for, pumping, liquids, and, granulated, solids, such, as, coal, and, grain, described, by, vitruvius, archimedes, device, may, have, been, an, improvement, on, a, screw, pump, that, was, used, to, irrigate, the, hanging, gardens, of, babylon, the, world, s, first, seagoing, steamship, with, a, screw, propeller, was, the, ss, archimedes, which, was, launched, in, 1839, and, named, in, honor, of, archimedes, and, his, work, on, the, screw, archimedes, is, said, to, have, designed, a, claw, as, a, weapon, to, defend, the, city, of, syracuse, also, known, as, the, ship, shaker, the, claw, consisted, of, a, crane, like, arm, from, which, a, large, metal, grappling, hook, was, suspended, when, the, claw, was, dropped, onto, an, attacking, ship, the, arm, would, swing, upwards, lifting, the, ship, out, of, the, water, and, possibly, sinking, it, there, have, been, modern, experiments, to, test, the, feasibility, of, the, claw, and, in, 2005, a, television, documentary, entitled, superweapons, of, the, ancient, world, built, a, version, of, the, claw, and, concluded, that, it, was, a, workable, device, archimedes, has, also, been, credited, with, improving, the, power, and, accuracy, of, the, catapult, and, with, inventing, the, odometer, during, the, first, punic, war, the, odometer, was, described, as, a, cart, with, a, gear, mechanism, that, dropped, a, ball, into, a, container, after, each, mile, traveled, as, legend, has, it, archimedes, arranged, mirrors, as, a, parabolic, reflector, to, burn, ships, attacking, syracuse, using, focused, sunlight, while, there, is, no, extant, contemporary, evidence, of, this, feat, and, modern, scholars, believe, it, did, not, happen, archimedes, may, have, written, a, work, on, mirrors, entitled, catoptrica, and, lucian, and, galen, writing, in, the, second, century, ad, mentioned, that, during, the, siege, of, syracuse, archimedes, had, burned, enemy, ships, nearly, four, hundred, years, later, anthemius, despite, skepticism, tried, to, reconstruct, archimedes, hypothetical, reflector, geometry, the, purported, device, sometimes, called, archimedes, heat, ray, has, been, the, subject, of, an, ongoing, debate, about, its, credibility, since, the, renaissance, ren, descartes, rejected, it, as, false, while, modern, researchers, have, attempted, to, recreate, the, effect, using, only, the, means, that, would, have, been, available, to, archimedes, mostly, with, negative, results, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, large, array, of, highly, polished, bronze, or, copper, shields, acting, as, mirrors, could, have, been, employed, to, focus, sunlight, onto, a, ship, but, the, overall, effect, would, have, been, blinding, dazzling, or, distracting, the, crew, of, the, ship, rather, than, fire, using, modern, materials, and, larger, scale, sunlight, concentrating, solar, furnaces, can, reach, very, high, temperatures, and, are, sometimes, used, for, generating, electricity, archimedes, discusses, astronomical, measurements, of, the, earth, sun, and, moon, as, well, as, aristarchus, heliocentric, model, of, the, universe, in, the, sand, reckoner, without, the, use, of, either, trigonometry, or, a, table, of, chords, archimedes, determines, the, sun, s, apparent, diameter, by, first, describing, the, procedure, and, instrument, used, to, make, observations, a, straight, rod, with, pegs, or, grooves, applying, correction, factors, to, these, measurements, and, finally, giving, the, result, in, the, form, of, upper, and, lower, bounds, to, account, for, observational, error, ptolemy, quoting, hipparchus, also, references, archimedes, solstice, observations, in, the, almagest, this, would, make, archimedes, the, first, known, greek, to, have, recorded, multiple, solstice, dates, and, times, in, successive, years, cicero, s, de, re, publica, portrays, a, fictional, conversation, taking, place, in, 129, bc, after, the, capture, of, syracuse, in, the, second, punic, war, marcellus, is, said, to, have, taken, back, to, rome, two, mechanisms, which, were, constructed, by, archimedes, and, which, showed, the, motion, of, the, sun, moon, and, five, planets, cicero, also, mentions, similar, mechanisms, designed, by, thales, of, miletus, and, eudoxus, of, cnidus, the, dialogue, says, that, marcellus, kept, one, of, the, devices, as, his, only, personal, loot, from, syracuse, and, donated, the, other, to, the, temple, of, virtue, in, rome, marcellus, s, mechanism, was, demonstrated, according, to, cicero, by, gaius, sulpicius, gallus, to, lucius, furius, philus, who, described, it, thus, hanc, sphaeram, gallus, cum, moveret, fiebat, ut, soli, luna, totidem, conversionibus, in, aere, illo, quot, diebus, in, ipso, caelo, succederet, ex, quo, et, in, caelo, sphaera, solis, fieret, eadem, illa, defectio, et, incideret, luna, tum, in, eam, metam, quae, esset, umbra, terrae, cum, sol, e, regione, when, gallus, moved, the, globe, it, happened, that, the, moon, followed, the, sun, by, as, many, turns, on, that, bronze, contrivance, as, in, the, sky, itself, from, which, also, in, the, sky, the, sun, s, globe, became, to, have, that, same, eclipse, and, the, moon, came, then, to, that, position, which, was, its, shadow, on, the, earth, when, the, sun, was, in, line, this, is, a, description, of, a, small, planetarium, pappus, of, alexandria, reports, on, a, now, lost, treatise, by, archimedes, dealing, with, the, construction, of, these, mechanisms, entitled, on, sphere, making, modern, research, in, this, area, has, been, focused, on, the, antikythera, mechanism, another, device, built, c, 100, bc, probably, designed, with, a, similar, purpose, constructing, mechanisms, of, this, kind, would, have, required, a, sophisticated, knowledge, of, differential, gearing, this, was, once, thought, to, have, been, beyond, the, range, of, the, technology, available, in, ancient, times, but, the, discovery, of, the, antikythera, mechanism, in, 1902, has, confirmed, that, devices, of, this, kind, were, known, to, the, ancient, greeks, while, he, is, often, regarded, as, a, designer, of, mechanical, devices, archimedes, also, made, contributions, to, the, field, of, mathematics, plutarch, wrote, that, archimedes, placed, his, whole, affection, and, ambition, in, those, purer, speculations, where, there, can, be, no, reference, to, the, vulgar, needs, of, life, though, some, scholars, believe, this, may, be, a, mischaracterization, archimedes, was, able, to, use, indivisibles, a, precursor, to, infinitesimals, in, a, way, that, is, similar, to, modern, integral, calculus, through, proof, by, contradiction, reductio, ad, absurdum, he, could, give, answers, to, problems, to, an, arbitrary, degree, of, accuracy, while, specifying, the, limits, within, which, the, answer, lay, this, technique, is, known, as, the, method, of, exhaustion, and, he, employed, it, to, approximate, the, areas, of, figures, and, the, value, of, in, measurement, of, a, circle, he, did, this, by, drawing, a, larger, regular, hexagon, outside, a, circle, then, a, smaller, regular, hexagon, inside, the, circle, and, progressively, doubling, the, number, of, sides, of, each, regular, polygon, calculating, the, length, of, a, side, of, each, polygon, at, each, step, as, the, number, of, sides, increases, it, becomes, a, more, accurate, approximation, of, a, circle, after, four, such, steps, when, the, polygons, had, 96, sides, each, he, was, able, to, determine, that, the, value, of, lay, between, 3, 1, 7, approx, 3, 1429, and, 3, 10, 71, approx, 3, 1408, consistent, with, its, actual, value, of, approximately, 3, 1416, he, also, proved, that, the, area, of, a, circle, was, equal, to, multiplied, by, the, square, of, the, radius, of, the, circle, r, 2, textstyle, pi, r, 2, in, on, the, sphere, and, cylinder, archimedes, postulates, that, any, magnitude, when, added, to, itself, enough, times, will, exceed, any, given, magnitude, today, this, is, known, as, the, archimedean, property, of, real, numbers, archimedes, gives, the, value, of, the, square, root, of, 3, as, lying, between, 265, 153, approximately, 1, 7320261, and, 1351, 780, approximately, 1, 7320512, in, measurement, of, a, circle, the, actual, value, is, approximately, 1, 7320508, making, this, a, very, accurate, estimate, he, introduced, this, result, without, offering, any, explanation, of, how, he, had, obtained, it, this, aspect, of, the, work, of, archimedes, caused, john, wallis, to, remark, that, he, was, as, it, were, of, set, purpose, to, have, covered, up, the, traces, of, his, investigation, as, if, he, had, grudged, posterity, the, secret, of, his, method, of, inquiry, while, he, wished, to, extort, from, them, assent, to, his, results, it, is, possible, that, he, used, an, iterative, procedure, to, calculate, these, values, in, quadrature, of, the, parabola, archimedes, proved, that, the, area, enclosed, by, a, parabola, and, a, straight, line, is, 4, 3, times, the, area, of, a, corresponding, inscribed, triangle, as, shown, in, the, figure, at, right, he, expressed, the, solution, to, the, problem, as, an, infinite, geometric, series, with, the, common, ratio, 1, 4, if, the, first, term, in, this, series, is, the, area, of, the, triangle, then, the, second, is, the, sum, of, the, areas, of, two, triangles, whose, bases, are, the, two, smaller, secant, lines, and, whose, third, vertex, is, where, the, line, that, is, parallel, to, the, parabola, s, axis, and, that, passes, through, the, midpoint, of, the, base, intersects, the, parabola, and, so, on, this, proof, uses, a, variation, of, the, series, 1, 4, 1, 16, 1, 64, 1, 256, which, sums, to, 1, 3, in, the, sand, reckoner, archimedes, set, out, to, calculate, a, number, that, was, greater, than, the, grains, of, sand, needed, to, fill, the, universe, in, doing, so, he, challenged, the, notion, that, the, number, of, grains, of, sand, was, too, large, to, be, counted, he, wrote, there, are, some, king, gelo, who, think, that, the, number, of, the, sand, is, infinite, in, multitude, and, i, mean, by, the, sand, not, only, that, which, exists, about, syracuse, and, the, rest, of, sicily, but, also, that, which, is, found, in, every, region, whether, inhabited, or, uninhabited, to, solve, the, problem, archimedes, devised, a, system, of, counting, based, on, the, myriad, the, word, itself, derives, from, the, greek, murias, for, the, number, 10, 000, he, proposed, a, number, system, using, powers, of, a, myriad, of, myriads, 100, million, i, e, 10, 000, x, 10, 000, and, concluded, that, the, number, of, grains, of, sand, required, to, fill, the, universe, would, be, 8, vigintillion, or, 8, 10, 63, the, works, of, archimedes, were, written, in, doric, greek, the, dialect, of, ancient, syracuse, many, written, works, by, archimedes, have, not, survived, or, are, only, extant, in, heavily, edited, fragments, at, least, seven, of, his, treatises, are, known, to, have, existed, due, to, references, made, by, other, authors, pappus, of, alexandria, mentions, on, sphere, making, and, another, work, on, polyhedra, while, theon, of, alexandria, quotes, a, remark, about, refraction, from, the, now, lost, catoptrica, archimedes, made, his, work, known, through, correspondence, with, the, mathematicians, in, alexandria, the, writings, of, archimedes, were, first, collected, by, the, byzantine, greek, architect, isidore, of, miletus, c, 530, ad, while, commentaries, on, the, works, of, archimedes, written, by, eutocius, in, the, sixth, century, ad, helped, to, bring, his, work, a, wider, audience, archimedes, work, was, translated, into, arabic, by, th, bit, ibn, qurra, 836, 901, ad, and, into, latin, via, arabic, by, gerard, of, cremona, c, 1114, 1187, direct, greek, to, latin, translations, were, later, done, by, william, of, moerbeke, c, 1215, 1286, and, iacobus, cremonensis, c, 1400, 1453, during, the, renaissance, the, editio, princeps, first, edition, was, published, in, basel, in, 1544, by, johann, herwagen, with, the, works, of, archimedes, in, greek, and, latin, the, following, are, ordered, chronologically, based, on, new, terminological, and, historical, criteria, set, by, knorr, 1978, and, sato, 1986, this, is, a, short, work, consisting, of, three, propositions, it, is, written, in, the, form, of, a, correspondence, with, dositheus, of, pelusium, who, was, a, student, of, conon, of, samos, in, proposition, ii, archimedes, gives, an, approximation, of, the, value, of, pi, showing, that, it, is, greater, than, 223, 71, 3, 1408, and, less, than, 22, 7, 3, 1428, in, this, treatise, also, known, as, psammites, archimedes, finds, a, number, that, is, greater, than, the, grains, of, sand, needed, to, fill, the, universe, this, book, mentions, the, heliocentric, theory, of, the, solar, system, proposed, by, aristarchus, of, samos, as, well, as, contemporary, ideas, about, the, size, of, the, earth, and, the, distance, between, various, celestial, bodies, by, using, a, system, of, numbers, based, on, powers, of, the, myriad, archimedes, concludes, that, the, number, of, grains, of, sand, required, to, fill, the, universe, is, 8, 10, 63, in, modern, notation, the, introductory, letter, states, that, archimedes, father, was, an, astronomer, named, phidias, the, sand, reckoner, is, the, only, surviving, work, in, which, archimedes, discusses, his, views, on, astronomy, there, are, two, books, to, on, the, equilibrium, of, planes, the, first, contains, seven, postulates, and, fifteen, propositions, while, the, second, book, contains, ten, propositions, in, the, first, book, archimedes, proves, the, law, of, the, lever, which, states, that, magnitudes, are, in, equilibrium, at, distances, reciprocally, proportional, to, their, weights, archimedes, uses, the, principles, derived, to, calculate, the, areas, and, centers, of, gravity, of, various, geometric, figures, including, triangles, parallelograms, and, parabolas, in, this, work, of, 24, propositions, addressed, to, dositheus, archimedes, proves, by, two, methods, that, the, area, enclosed, by, a, parabola, and, a, straight, line, is, 4, 3, the, area, of, a, triangle, with, equal, base, and, height, he, achieves, this, in, one, of, his, proofs, by, calculating, the, value, of, a, geometric, series, that, sums, to, infinity, with, the, ratio, 1, 4, in, this, two, volume, treatise, addressed, to, dositheus, archimedes, obtains, the, result, of, which, he, was, most, proud, namely, the, relationship, between, a, sphere, and, a, circumscribed, cylinder, of, the, same, height, and, diameter, the, volume, is, 4, 3, r, 3, for, the, sphere, and, 2, r, 3, for, the, cylinder, the, surface, area, is, 4, r, 2, for, the, sphere, and, 6, r, 2, for, the, cylinder, including, its, two, bases, where, r, is, the, radius, of, the, sphere, and, cylinder, this, work, of, 28, propositions, is, also, addressed, to, dositheus, the, treatise, defines, what, is, now, called, the, archimedean, spiral, it, is, the, locus, of, points, corresponding, to, the, locations, over, time, of, a, point, moving, away, from, a, fixed, point, with, a, constant, speed, along, a, line, which, rotates, with, constant, angular, velocity, equivalently, in, modern, polar, coordinates, r, it, can, be, described, by, the, equation, r, a, b, displaystyle, r, a, b, theta, with, real, numbers, a, and, b, this, is, an, early, example, of, a, mechanical, curve, a, curve, traced, by, a, moving, point, considered, by, a, greek, mathematician, this, is, a, work, in, 32, propositions, addressed, to, dositheus, in, this, treatise, archimedes, calculates, the, areas, and, volumes, of, sections, of, cones, spheres, and, paraboloids, there, are, two, books, of, on, floating, bodies, in, the, first, book, archimedes, spells, out, the, law, of, equilibrium, of, fluids, and, proves, that, water, will, adopt, a, spherical, form, around, a, center, of, gravity, this, may, have, been, an, attempt, at, explaining, the, theory, of, contemporary, greek, astronomers, such, as, eratosthenes, that, the, earth, is, round, the, fluids, described, by, archimedes, are, not, self, gravitating, since, he, assumes, the, existence, of, a, point, towards, which, all, things, fall, in, order, to, derive, the, spherical, shape, archimedes, principle, of, buoyancy, is, given, in, this, work, stated, as, follows, any, body, wholly, or, partially, immersed, in, fluid, experiences, an, upthrust, equal, to, but, opposite, in, direction, to, the, weight, of, the, fluid, displaced, in, the, second, part, he, calculates, the, equilibrium, positions, of, sections, of, paraboloids, this, was, probably, an, idealization, of, the, shapes, of, ships, hulls, some, of, his, sections, float, with, the, base, under, water, and, the, summit, above, water, similar, to, the, way, that, icebergs, float, also, known, as, loculus, of, archimedes, or, archimedes, box, this, is, a, dissection, puzzle, similar, to, a, tangram, and, the, treatise, describing, it, was, found, in, more, complete, form, in, the, archimedes, palimpsest, archimedes, calculates, the, areas, of, the, 14, pieces, which, can, be, assembled, to, form, a, square, reviel, netz, of, stanford, university, argued, in, 2003, that, archimedes, was, attempting, to, determine, how, many, ways, the, pieces, could, be, assembled, into, the, shape, of, a, square, netz, calculates, that, the, pieces, can, be, made, into, a, square, 17, 152, ways, the, number, of, arrangements, is, 536, when, solutions, that, are, equivalent, by, rotation, and, reflection, are, excluded, the, puzzle, represents, an, example, of, an, early, problem, in, combinatorics, the, origin, of, the, puzzle, s, name, is, unclear, and, it, has, been, suggested, that, it, is, taken, from, the, ancient, greek, word, for, throat, or, gullet, stomachos, ausonius, calls, the, puzzle, ostomachion, a, greek, compound, word, formed, from, the, roots, of, osteon, bone, and, mach, fight, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, discovered, this, work, in, a, greek, manuscript, consisting, of, a, 44, line, poem, in, the, herzog, august, library, in, wolfenb, ttel, germany, in, 1773, it, is, addressed, to, eratosthenes, and, the, mathematicians, in, alexandria, archimedes, challenges, them, to, count, the, numbers, of, cattle, in, the, herd, of, the, sun, by, solving, a, number, of, simultaneous, diophantine, equations, there, is, a, more, difficult, version, of, the, problem, in, which, some, of, the, answers, are, required, to, be, square, numbers, a, amthor, first, solved, this, version, of, the, problem, in, 1880, and, the, answer, is, a, very, large, number, approximately, 7, 760271, 10, 206, 544, this, treatise, was, thought, lost, until, the, discovery, of, the, archimedes, palimpsest, in, 1906, in, this, work, archimedes, uses, indivisibles, and, shows, how, breaking, up, a, figure, into, an, infinite, number, of, infinitely, small, parts, can, be, used, to, determine, its, area, or, volume, he, may, have, considered, this, method, lacking, in, formal, rigor, so, he, also, used, the, method, of, exhaustion, to, derive, the, results, as, with, the, cattle, problem, the, method, of, mechanical, theorems, was, written, in, the, form, of, a, letter, to, eratosthenes, in, alexandria, archimedes, book, of, lemmas, or, liber, assumptorum, is, a, treatise, with, 15, propositions, on, the, nature, of, circles, the, earliest, known, copy, of, the, text, is, in, arabic, t, l, heath, and, marshall, clagett, argued, that, it, cannot, have, been, written, by, archimedes, in, its, current, form, since, it, quotes, archimedes, suggesting, modification, by, another, author, the, lemmas, may, be, based, on, an, earlier, work, by, archimedes, that, is, now, lost, it, has, also, been, claimed, that, the, formula, for, calculating, the, area, of, a, triangle, from, the, length, of, its, sides, was, known, to, archimedes, though, its, first, appearance, is, in, the, work, of, heron, of, alexandria, in, the, 1st, century, ad, other, questionable, attributions, to, archimedes, work, include, the, latin, poem, carmen, de, ponderibus, et, mensuris, 4th, or, 5th, century, which, describes, the, use, of, a, hydrostatic, balance, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, crown, and, the, 12th, century, text, mappae, clavicula, which, contains, instructions, on, how, to, perform, assaying, of, metals, by, calculating, their, specific, gravities, the, foremost, document, containing, archimedes, work, is, the, archimedes, palimpsest, in, 1906, the, danish, professor, johan, ludvig, heiberg, visited, constantinople, to, examine, a, 174, page, goatskin, parchment, of, prayers, written, in, the, 13th, century, after, reading, a, short, transcription, published, seven, years, earlier, by, papadopoulos, kerameus, he, confirmed, that, it, was, indeed, a, palimpsest, a, document, with, text, that, had, been, written, over, an, erased, older, work, palimpsests, were, created, by, scraping, the, ink, from, existing, works, and, reusing, them, a, common, practice, in, the, middle, ages, as, vellum, was, expensive, the, older, works, in, the, palimpsest, were, identified, by, scholars, as, 10th, century, copies, of, previously, lost, treatises, by, archimedes, the, parchment, spent, hundreds, of, years, in, a, monastery, library, in, constantinople, before, being, sold, to, a, private, collector, in, the, 1920s, on, 29, october, 1998, it, was, sold, at, auction, to, an, anonymous, buyer, for, a, total, of, 2, 2, million, the, palimpsest, holds, seven, treatises, including, the, only, surviving, copy, of, on, floating, bodies, in, the, original, greek, it, is, the, only, known, source, of, the, method, of, mechanical, theorems, referred, to, by, suidas, and, thought, to, have, been, lost, forever, stomachion, was, also, discovered, in, the, palimpsest, with, a, more, complete, analysis, of, the, puzzle, than, had, been, found, in, previous, texts, the, palimpsest, was, stored, at, the, walters, art, museum, in, baltimore, maryland, where, it, was, subjected, to, a, range, of, modern, tests, including, the, use, of, ultraviolet, and, x, ray, light, to, read, the, overwritten, text, it, has, since, returned, to, its, anonymous, owner, the, treatises, in, the, archimedes, palimpsest, include, sometimes, called, the, father, of, mathematics, and, mathematical, physics, archimedes, had, a, wide, influence, on, mathematics, and, science, historians, of, science, and, mathematics, almost, universally, agree, that, archimedes, was, the, finest, mathematician, from, antiquity, eric, temple, bell, for, instance, wrote, any, list, of, the, three, greatest, mathematicians, of, all, history, would, include, the, name, of, archimedes, the, other, two, usually, associated, with, him, are, newton, and, gauss, some, considering, the, relative, wealth, or, poverty, of, mathematics, and, physical, science, in, the, respective, ages, in, which, these, giants, lived, and, estimating, their, achievements, against, the, background, of, their, times, would, put, archimedes, first, likewise, alfred, north, whitehead, and, george, f, simmons, said, of, archimedes, in, the, year, 1500, europe, knew, less, than, archimedes, who, died, in, the, year, 212, bc, if, we, consider, what, all, other, men, accomplished, in, mathematics, and, physics, on, every, continent, and, in, every, civilization, from, the, beginning, of, time, down, to, the, seventeenth, century, in, western, europe, the, achievements, of, archimedes, outweighs, it, all, he, was, a, great, civilization, all, by, himself, reviel, netz, suppes, professor, in, greek, mathematics, and, astronomy, at, stanford, university, and, an, expert, in, archimedes, notes, and, so, since, archimedes, led, more, than, anyone, else, to, the, formation, of, the, calculus, and, since, he, was, the, pioneer, of, the, application, of, mathematics, to, the, physical, world, it, turns, out, that, western, science, is, but, a, series, of, footnotes, to, archimedes, thus, it, turns, out, that, archimedes, is, the, most, important, scientist, who, ever, lived, leonardo, da, vinci, repeatedly, expressed, admiration, for, archimedes, and, attributed, his, invention, architonnerre, to, archimedes, galileo, called, him, superhuman, and, my, master, while, huygens, said, i, think, archimedes, is, comparable, to, no, one, consciously, emulating, him, in, his, early, work, leibniz, said, he, who, understands, archimedes, and, apollonius, will, admire, less, the, achievements, of, the, foremost, men, of, later, times, gauss, s, heroes, were, archimedes, and, newton, and, moritz, cantor, who, studied, under, gauss, in, the, university, of, g, ttingen, reported, that, he, once, remarked, in, conversation, that, there, had, been, only, three, epoch, making, mathematicians, archimedes, newton, and, eisenstein, the, inventor, nikola, tesla, praised, him, saying, archimedes, was, my, ideal, i, admired, the, works, of, artists, but, to, my, mind, they, were, only, shadows, and, semblances, the, inventor, i, thought, gives, to, the, world, creations, which, are, palpable, which, live, and, work, there, is, a, crater, on, the, moon, named, archimedes, 29, 42, n, 4, 00, w, 29, 7, n, 4, 0, w, 29, 7, 4, 0, in, his, honor, as, well, as, a, lunar, mountain, range, the, montes, archimedes, 25, 18, n, 4, 36, w, 25, 3, n, 4, 6, w, 25, 3, 4, 6, the, fields, medal, for, outstanding, achievement, in, mathematics, carries, a, portrait, of, archimedes, along, with, a, carving, illustrating, his, proof, on, the, sphere, and, the, cylinder, the, inscription, around, the, head, of, archimedes, is, a, quote, attributed, to, 1st, century, ad, poet, manilius, which, reads, in, latin, transire, suum, pectus, mundoque, potiri, rise, above, oneself, and, grasp, the, world, archimedes, has, appeared, on, postage, stamps, issued, by, east, germany, 1973, greece, 1983, italy, 1983, nicaragua, 1971, san, marino, 1982, and, spain, 1963, the, exclamation, of, eureka, attributed, to, archimedes, is, the, state, motto, of, california, in, this, instance, the, word, refers, to, the, discovery, of, gold, near, sutter, s, mill, in, 1848, which, sparked, the, california, gold, rush, father, of, mathematical, physics, james, h, williams,
