alfred, reginald, radcliffe, brown, fba, born, alfred, reginald, brown, 1881, 1955, was, an, english, social, anthropologist, who, helped, further, develop, the, theory, of, structural, functionalism, he, conducted, fieldwork, in, the, andaman, islands, and, western, australia, which, became, the, basis, of, his, later, books, he, held, academic, appointments, at, universities, in, cape, town, sydney, chicago, and, oxford, and, sought, to, use, model, the, field, of, anthopology, after, the, natural, sciences, alfred, reginald, radcliffe, brown, was, born, alfred, reginald, brown, in, sparkbrook, birmingham, england, the, second, son, of, alfred, brown, d, 1886, a, manufacturer, s, clerk, and, his, wife, hannah, n, e, radcliffe, he, later, changed, his, last, name, by, deed, poll, to, radcliffe, brown, radcliffe, being, his, mother, s, maiden, name, he, was, educated, at, king, edward, s, school, birmingham, and, trinity, college, cambridge, b, a, 1905, m, a, 1909, graduating, with, first, class, honours, in, the, moral, sciences, tripos, at, trinity, college, he, was, elected, anthony, wilkin, student, in, 1906, and, 1909, while, still, a, student, he, earned, the, nickname, anarchy, brown, for, his, close, interest, in, the, writings, of, the, anarcho, communist, and, scientist, peter, kropotkin, he, studied, psychology, under, w, h, r, rivers, who, with, a, c, haddon, led, him, toward, social, anthropology, under, the, latter, s, influence, he, travelled, to, the, andaman, islands, 1906, 1908, and, western, australia, 1910, 1912, with, biologist, and, writer, e, l, grant, watson, and, australian, writer, daisy, bates, to, conduct, fieldwork, into, the, workings, of, the, societies, there, his, time, in, the, andaman, islands, and, western, australia, were, the, basis, of, his, later, books, the, andaman, islanders, 1922, and, the, social, organization, of, australian, tribes, 1930, at, the, 1914, meeting, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, melbourne, bates, accused, him, of, plagiarising, her, work, based, on, an, unpublished, manuscript, she, had, sent, him, for, comment, before, departing, for, western, australia, brown, married, winifred, marie, lyon, in, cambridge, they, had, one, daughter, mary, cynthia, lyon, radcliffe, the, couple, became, estranged, by, about, 1926, they, may, have, divorced, in, 1938, sources, disagree, on, whether, a, divorce, was, completed, in, 1916, brown, became, a, director, of, education, in, tonga, in, 1921, he, moved, to, cape, town, to, become, professor, of, social, anthropology, founding, the, school, of, african, life, further, university, appointments, were, university, of, cape, town, 1921, 25, university, of, sydney, 1925, 31, and, university, of, chicago, 1931, 37, among, his, most, prominent, students, during, his, years, at, the, university, of, chicago, were, sol, tax, and, fred, eggan, while, at, the, university, of, sydney, he, was, a, cultivator, of, the, arts, and, championed, edward, de, vere, 17th, earl, of, oxford, as, the, author, of, the, works, attributed, to, shakespeare, fearing, that, depression, may, lead, to, financial, collapse, radcliffe, brown, departed, in, 1931, to, fill, a, chair, at, the, university, of, chicago, leaving, his, successors, to, solicit, rockefeller, grants, and, government, funds, to, save, the, sydney, department, after, these, various, far, flung, appointments, he, returned, to, england, in, 1937, to, take, up, an, appointment, to, the, first, chair, in, social, anthropology, at, oxford, university, in, 1937, he, held, this, post, until, his, retirement, in, 1946, survived, by, his, daughter, he, died, in, london, in, 1955, at, the, age, of, 74, while, radcliffe, brown, founded, the, institute, of, social, and, cultural, anthropology, at, oxford, according, to, rodney, needham, his, absence, from, the, institute, during, the, war, years, prevented, his, theories, and, approach, from, having, a, major, influence, on, oxford, anthropology, radcliffe, brown, was, influenced, by, his, tutor, w, w, rouse, ball, to, study, a, moral, science, psychology, philosophical, subjects, and, economics, instead, of, a, natural, science, which, he, originally, wanted, to, pick, during, his, time, at, cambridge, professors, haddon, and, rivers, encouraged, him, to, study, anthropology, and, discover, his, interests, in, the, field, haddon, led, him, towards, the, comparative, method, in, specific, societies, in, anthropology, classification, and, morphology, inductive, generalization, and, to, sympathize, with, durkheim, s, approaches, rivers, inspired, radcliffe, in, psychology, to, approach, anthropology, with, many, different, qualities, of, mind, he, has, been, described, as, the, classic, to, bronis, aw, malinowski, s, romantic, radcliffe, brown, brought, french, sociology, namely, mile, durkheim, to, british, anthropology, constructing, a, rigorous, battery, of, concepts, to, frame, ethnography, durkheim, inspired, radcliffe, brown, throughout, the, entirety, of, his, profession, in, anthropology, one, of, radcliffe, brown, s, goals, was, to, transform, anthropology, into, a, real, science, based, on, the, natural, sciences, he, demonstrated, these, ideologies, in, his, book, published, in, 1957, a, natural, science, of, society, in, 1906, one, of, alfred, s, primary, focuses, in, the, field, was, kinship, and, familial, relations, of, western, australians, within, these, communities, he, uncovered, distinct, social, organizations, that, proved, adaptation, and, fusion, were, essential, in, keeping, the, system, functioning, the, term, structural, functionalism, would, later, be, used, to, describe, the, idea, that, the, life, of, a, society, may, be, viewed, as, an, active, system, of, functionally, consistent, interdependent, elements, radcliffe, brown, has, often, been, associated, with, functionalism, and, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, founder, of, structural, functionalism, structural, functionalism, which, can, be, traced, back, to, famous, sociologist, mile, durkheim, is, the, social, theory, that, assumes, societal, institution, e, g, government, school, systems, family, structures, etc, play, a, role, in, its, success, through, the, two, different, group, dynamics, mechanical, solidarity, a, sentimental, attraction, of, social, units, or, groups, that, perform, the, same, or, similar, functions, organic, solidarity, which, is, relies, on, interdependence, based, on, differentiated, functions, and, specialization, a, society, creates, a, web, that, allows, a, cohesive, existence, of, heterogenous, groups, alfred, built, off, of, these, principles, believing, that, studying, social, structures, like, kinship, ties, would, be, evidence, enough, for, understanding, how, social, structures, affect, the, maintenance, of, a, society, stating, human, beings, are, connected, by, a, complex, network, of, social, relations, i, use, the, term, social, structure, to, denote, this, network, of, actually, existing, relations, on, social, structure, 190, he, also, clarifies, that, we, may, define, it, as, a, condition, in, which, all, parts, of, the, system, work, together, with, a, sufficient, degree, of, harmony, or, internal, consistency, i, e, without, producing, persistent, conflicts, which, can, neither, be, resolved, nor, regulated, on, the, concept, of, function, in, social, science, 181, nonetheless, radcliffe, brown, vehemently, denied, being, a, functionalist, and, carefully, distinguished, his, concept, of, function, from, that, of, malinowski, who, openly, advocated, functionalism, while, malinowski, s, functionalism, claimed, that, social, practices, could, be, directly, explained, by, their, ability, to, satisfy, basic, biological, needs, radcliffe, brown, rejected, this, as, baseless, instead, influenced, by, the, process, philosophy, of, alfred, north, whitehead, he, claimed, that, the, fundamental, units, of, anthropology, were, processes, of, human, life, and, interaction, because, these, are, by, definition, characterized, by, constant, flux, what, calls, for, explanation, is, the, occurrence, of, stability, why, radcliffe, brown, asked, would, some, patterns, of, social, practices, repeat, themselves, and, even, seem, to, become, fixed, he, reasoned, that, this, would, at, least, require, that, other, practices, must, not, conflict, with, them, too, much, and, that, in, some, cases, it, may, be, that, practices, grow, to, support, each, other, a, notion, he, called, coadaptation, deriving, from, the, biological, term, functional, analysis, then, was, just, the, attempt, to, explain, stability, by, discovering, how, practices, fit, together, to, sustain, that, stability, the, function, of, practice, was, just, its, role, in, sustaining, the, overall, social, structure, insofar, as, there, was, a, stable, social, structure, radcliffe, brown, 1957, while, l, vi, strauss, 1958, claimed, that, social, structure, and, the, social, relations, that, are, its, constituents, are, theoretical, constructions, used, to, model, social, life, radcliffe, brown, only, half, agreed, in, addition, to, identifying, abstract, relationships, between, social, structures, radcliffe, brown, argued, for, the, importance, of, the, notion, of, a, total, social, structure, which, is, the, sum, total, of, social, relations, in, a, given, social, unit, of, analysis, during, a, given, period, the, identification, of, functions, of, social, practices, was, supposed, to, be, relative, to, this, total, social, structure, l, vi, strauss, saw, social, structure, as, a, model, within, his, research, radcliffe, brown, focused, on, so, called, primitive, societies, he, believed, kinship, played, a, large, role, in, these, societies, and, that, patrilineages, clans, tribes, and, units, all, relate, to, kinship, rules, in, society, and, are, essential, in, political, organization, radcliffe, brown, claimed, that, all, research, on, social, structure, is, based, on, observations, what, anthropologists, see, and, hear, about, individual, peoples, radcliffe, brown, also, argued, that, the, study, of, social, structure, encompassed, culture, therefore, there, is, no, need, for, a, separate, field, dedicated, to, culture, a, major, view, in, the, study, of, tribal, societies, had, been, that, all, societies, follow, a, unilineal, path, evolutionism, and, that, therefore, primitive, societies, could, be, understood, as, earlier, stages, along, that, path, conversely, modern, societies, contained, vestiges, of, older, forms, another, view, was, that, social, practices, tend, to, develop, only, once, and, that, therefore, commonalities, and, differences, between, societies, could, be, explained, by, a, historical, reconstruction, of, the, interaction, between, societies, diffusionism, according, to, both, of, these, views, the, proper, way, to, explain, differences, between, tribal, societies, and, modern, ones, was, historical, reconstruction, radcliffe, brown, rejected, both, of, these, views, because, of, the, untestable, nature, of, historical, reconstructions, instead, he, argued, for, the, use, of, the, comparative, method, to, find, regularities, in, human, societies, and, thereby, build, up, a, genuinely, scientific, knowledge, of, social, life, to, that, end, radcliffe, brown, argued, for, a, natural, science, of, society, he, claimed, that, there, was, an, independent, role, for, social, anthropology, here, separate, from, psychology, though, not, in, conflict, with, it, this, was, because, psychology, was, to, be, the, study, of, individual, mental, processes, while, social, anthropology, was, to, study, processes, of, interaction, between, people, social, relations, thus, he, argued, for, a, principled, ontological, distinction, between, psychology, and, social, anthropology, in, the, same, way, as, one, might, try, to, make, a, principled, distinction, between, physics, and, biology, moreover, he, claimed, that, existing, social, scientific, disciplines, with, the, possible, exception, of, linguistics, were, arbitrary, once, our, knowledge, of, society, is, sufficient, he, argued, we, will, be, able, to, form, subdisciplines, of, anthropology, centred, around, relatively, isolated, parts, of, the, social, structure, but, without, extensive, scientific, knowledge, it, is, impossible, to, know, where, these, boundaries, should, be, drawn, radcliffe, brown, carried, out, extensive, fieldwork, in, the, andaman, islands, australia, and, elsewhere, on, the, basis, of, this, research, he, contributed, extensively, to, the, anthropological, ideas, on, kinship, and, criticised, l, vi, strauss, s, alliance, theory, he, also, produced, structural, analyses, of, myths, including, on, the, basis, of, the, concept, of, binary, distinctions, and, dialectical, opposition, an, idea, later, echoed, by, l, vi, strauss, according, to, radcliffe, brown, the, function, of, religion, is, to, install, a, sense, of, dependence, on, fear, and, other, emotional, strain, on, the, human, body, into, a, society, therefore, a, major, function, of, religion, is, to, affirm, and, strengthen, sentiments, necessary, for, a, society, to, continue, this, idea, was, developed, in, radcliffe, browns, book, the, adaman, islanders, free, press, 1963, radcliffe, brown, was, often, criticised, for, failing, to, consider, the, effect, of, historical, changes, in, the, societies, he, studied, in, particular, changes, brought, about, by, colonialism, nevertheless, he, is, now, considered, along, with, bronis, aw, malinowski, as, one, of, the, fathers, of, modern, social, anthropology, many, critics, also, believe, that, in, radcliffe, brown, s, theory, of, structural, functionalism, there, is, an, error, arising, from, the, assumption, that, one, s, abstraction, of, a, social, situation, reflects, social, reality, in, all, details, therefore, all, analysis, is, done, on, the, basis, of, imagination
