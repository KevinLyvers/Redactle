victory, against, carthage, in, the, second, punic, war, often, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, military, commanders, and, strategists, of, all, time, his, greatest, military, achievement, was, the, defeat, of, hannibal, at, the, battle, of, zama, in, 202, bc, this, victory, in, africa, earned, him, the, honorific, epithet, africanus, literally, meaning, the, african, but, meant, to, be, understood, as, a, conqueror, of, africa, scipio, s, conquest, of, carthaginian, iberia, culminated, in, the, battle, of, ilipa, in, 206, bc, against, hannibal, s, brother, mago, barca, although, considered, a, hero, by, the, roman, people, primarily, for, his, victories, against, carthage, scipio, had, many, opponents, especially, cato, the, elder, who, hated, him, deeply, in, 187, bc, he, was, tried, in, a, show, trial, alongside, his, brother, for, bribes, they, supposedly, received, from, the, seleucid, king, antiochos, iii, during, the, roman, seleucid, war, disillusioned, by, the, ingratitude, of, his, peers, scipio, left, rome, and, retired, from, public, life, at, his, villa, in, liternum, scipio, africanus, was, born, as, publius, cornelius, scipio, in, 236, bc, to, his, then, homonymous, father, and, pomponia, into, the, family, of, the, cornelii, scipiones, his, family, was, one, of, the, major, still, extant, patrician, families, and, had, held, multiple, consulships, within, living, memory, his, great, grandfather, lucius, cornelius, scipio, barbatus, and, grandfather, lucius, cornelius, scipio, had, both, been, consuls, and, censors, his, father, had, held, the, consulship, of, 218, bc, his, uncle, was, consul, in, 222, bc, and, his, mother, s, brothers, manius, pomponius, matho, and, marcus, pomponius, matho, were, both, consuls, in, 233, and, 231, respectively, the, second, punic, war, started, in, the, spring, of, 218, bc, when, the, roman, ultimatum, to, carthage, demanding, that, hannibal, withdraw, from, saguntum, in, spain, was, rejected, scipio, s, father, was, consul, that, year, and, the, younger, scipio, joined, him, in, the, campaign, to, stop, hannibal, s, march, on, italy, in, a, short, cavalry, engagement, between, scipio, s, father, and, hannibal, at, the, river, ticinus, near, modern, pavia, polybius, claims, that, the, son, saved, his, father, s, life, after, the, father, was, encircled, by, enemy, horsemen, other, sources, however, credit, an, unnamed, ligurian, slave, two, years, later, in, 216, bc, scipio, served, as, military, tribune, he, survived, the, disastrous, battle, of, cannae, his, father, in, law, the, consul, lucius, aemilius, paullus, was, there, slain, and, after, the, battle, rallied, survivors, at, canusium, according, to, livy, when, he, heard, that, lucius, caecilius, metellus, and, other, young, nobles, were, discussing, a, plan, to, abandon, the, republic, and, go, overseas, to, serve, as, mercenaries, scipio, stormed, into, the, meeting, and, forced, all, of, them, at, sword, point, to, swear, to, jupiter, and, the, capitoline, triad, that, they, would, never, abandon, rome, this, story, is, probably, a, late, invention, as, it, does, not, appear, in, polybius, the, next, year, in, 213, bc, he, was, elected, curule, aedile, and, served, with, his, cousin, marcus, cornelius, cethegus, his, candidacy, was, opposed, by, one, of, the, plebeian, tribunes, on, the, grounds, that, he, had, not, yet, reached, the, minimum, age, but, the, voters, expressed, such, enthusiastic, support, for, scipio, that, the, tribune, desisted, from, the, start, of, the, war, through, to, 211, bc, scipio, s, father, publius, cornelius, scipio, and, uncle, gnaeus, cornelius, scipio, calvus, were, in, command, of, rome, s, armies, in, spain, they, made, some, headway, when, the, carthaginians, were, forced, to, withdraw, a, considerable, portion, of, their, forces, to, handle, a, revolt, by, syphax, of, numidia, through, the, seven, years, from, 218, the, brothers, had, successfully, extended, roman, control, deep, into, carthaginian, territory, however, disaster, struck, in, 211, bc, when, the, brothers, divided, their, forces, to, attack, three, separate, carthaginian, armies, and, were, defeated, in, detail, the, brothers, fell, in, separate, battles, against, the, carthaginians, who, were, led, by, hasdrubal, barca, mago, barca, and, hasdrubal, gisco, the, two, barcas, were, hannibal, s, brothers, initially, gaius, claudius, nero, who, was, praetor, in, 212, bc, was, sent, to, contain, the, situation, but, in, 210, bc, the, assembly, elected, scipio, to, take, command, modern, scholars, dismiss, the, livian, narrative, of, senatorial, indecision, and, have, instead, suggested, that, the, senate, chose, scipio, but, forced, a, popular, vote, to, legitimise, an, irregular, command, giving, scipio, command, was, an, extraordinary, act, as, he, at, this, point, had, never, held, a, praetorship, or, consulship, but, was, regardless, granted, imperium, pro, consule, taking, command, on, his, arrival, to, spain, in, the, early, autumn, he, was, the, first, person, to, have, been, given, proconsular, imperium, without, having, held, consular, office, he, went, to, spain, with, some, 10, 000, reinforcements, and, was, joined, by, another, commander, marcus, junius, silanus, who, was, dispatched, pro, praetore, and, soon, assumed, command, of, nero, s, army, seeking, to, defeat, the, three, carthaginian, armies, in, detail, the, next, year, 209, bc, saw, scipio, s, first, major, campaign, he, besieged, carthago, nova, modern, cartagena, which, was, a, major, carthaginian, logistics, hub, and, of, substantial, strategic, importance, in, the, battle, he, captured, the, city, by, sending, a, wading, party, across, the, lagoon, to, the, city, s, north, when, it, reached, low, tide, he, told, the, troops, that, he, had, a, vision, in, which, the, god, neptune, had, promised, aid, this, alleged, vision, played, a, role, in, the, rapid, development, of, a, scipionic, legend, around, him, and, his, family, storming, the, city, rapidly, and, with, little, ability, to, tell, combatants, and, civilians, apart, scipio, ordered, his, men, to, massacre, all, they, encountered, and, pillage, any, structures, polybius, viewed, the, massacre, as, intended, to, terrorise, the, spanish, population, into, rapidly, surrendering, and, included, an, anecdote, of, romans, being, so, thorough, as, to, cut, even, the, dogs, and, other, animals, in, half, he, then, forced, the, surrender, of, mago, in, the, citadel, and, rapidly, switched, his, tune, sparing, the, remaining, citizens, and, only, enslaving, the, town, s, non, citizens, he, then, took, the, three, hundred, spanish, hostages, into, his, custody, giving, them, gifts, guaranteeing, their, safety, and, that, of, their, families, and, promising, them, freedom, if, their, respective, communities, would, ally, with, rome, after, the, battle, several, spanish, tribes, defected, to, the, romans, the, next, year, 208, bc, scipio, fought, hasdrubal, north, of, the, river, baetis, near, baecula, while, scipio, was, victorious, the, battle, was, indecisive, and, hasdrubal, escaped, north, with, most, of, his, army, across, the, pyrenees, for, italy, hasdrubal, and, his, army, reached, italy, in, 207, where, they, were, eventually, defeated, in, the, battle, of, the, metaurus, with, the, army, destroyed, and, hasdrubal, slain, the, following, year, hasdrubal, was, replaced, by, a, certain, hanno, who, was, captured, by, junius, silanus, in, celtiberia, following, the, army, under, hasdrubal, son, of, gisgo, which, retreated, to, gades, modern, c, diz, scipio, s, brother, took, orongis, modern, ja, n, before, a, decisive, victory, in, 206, bc, at, the, battle, of, ilipa, north, of, modern, seville, forced, the, carthaginians, to, withdraw, from, the, peninsula, in, mopping, up, operations, scipio, captured, ilourgeia, and, castulo, inflicting, severe, punishment, on, the, former, for, having, killed, refugees, from, his, army, other, roman, commanders, captured, other, towns, in, spain, including, astapa, whose, inhabitants, committed, mass, suicide, after, a, quickly, suppressed, revolt, by, spanish, tribes, when, false, rumours, of, scipio, s, death, from, illness, spread, he, crossed, into, africa, to, solicit, the, support, of, syphax, and, thence, into, western, hispania, to, meet, massinissa, for, the, same, purpose, syphax, pledged, loyalty, but, eventually, joined, with, the, carthaginians, massinissa, however, joined, with, the, romans, with, a, small, contingent, when, syphax, expelled, him, the, kingdom, of, massylii, meanwhile, gades, surrendered, to, the, romans, some, time, c, 206, bc, scipio, also, founded, the, town, of, italica, located, about, 9, km, northwest, of, seville, which, later, became, the, birthplace, of, the, emperors, trajan, hadrian, and, theodosius, i, with, a, general, victory, across, the, peninsula, scipio, then, returned, to, rome, to, stand, for, the, consulship, of, 205, bc, leaving, lucius, cornelius, lentulus, and, lucius, manlius, acidinus, in, command, he, returned, to, rome, late, in, the, year, according, to, livy, he, was, denied, a, triumph, on, the, grounds, that, he, was, privatus, that, is, sine, magistratu, and, had, never, been, elected, to, a, magistracy, with, imperium, scipio, was, elected, unanimously, to, the, consulship, of, 205, bc, amid, much, enthusiasm, he, was, 31, and, still, technically, too, young, to, be, consul, when, he, entered, into, office, he, demanded, that, the, senate, assign, him, the, province, of, africa, and, threatened, to, take, the, matter, to, the, popular, assemblies, if, it, refused, to, do, so, despite, fierce, opposition, from, the, princeps, senatus, quintus, fabius, maximus, verrucosus, the, senate, bowed, to, his, pressure, and, he, received, sicily, with, permission, to, cross, into, africa, if, he, wished, fabius, opposition, may, have, been, related, to, jealousy, of, scipio, s, popularity, but, also, was, likely, informed, by, the, failed, african, campaign, c, 255, bc, under, marcus, atilius, regulus, during, the, first, punic, war, which, saw, the, carthaginians, war, efforts, renewed, the, senate, regardless, assigned, scipio, no, additional, soldiers, leading, him, to, recruit, an, army, of, volunteers, livy, reports, that, from, his, clients, and, supporters, in, italy, he, mustered, some, 30, warships, and, 7, 000, men, he, spent, most, of, his, consulship, preparing, his, troops, in, sicily, for, the, invasion, of, africa, he, captured, locri, on, the, toe, of, italy, that, year, and, left, one, pleminius, in, command, there, after, pleminius, assumed, command, he, robbed, the, city, s, temple, and, tortured, and, killed, two, military, tribunes, for, these, crimes, the, senate, had, pleminius, placed, under, arrest, scipio, was, also, implicated, but, was, cleared, the, next, year, his, imperium, was, prorogued, into, 205, bc, and, in, that, year, he, crossed, with, his, men, into, africa, and, besieged, utica, before, withdrawing, and, pretending, in, the, winter, to, negotiate, with, the, carthaginians, during, those, pretended, negotiations, scipio, mapped, out, the, enemy, camps, and, launched, a, night, attack, that, was, successful, in, destroying, them, and, killing, a, large, number, of, the, enemy, the, armies, then, fought, in, the, battle, of, the, great, plains, some, time, early, in, the, new, year, his, imperium, was, prorogued, until, the, war, s, completion, and, after, capturing, syphax, of, numidia, restored, massinissa, to, the, kingdom, the, carthaginians, reacted, to, the, defeat, by, recalling, their, generals, hannibal, and, mago, from, italy, and, launching, their, fleet, against, scipio, s, to, cut, off, their, supply, lines, scipio, was, forced, into, a, naval, battle, near, utica, but, was, able, to, avert, disaster, losing, only, some, sixty, transport, ships, another, set, of, peace, negotiations, occurred, with, the, carthaginians, eventually, agreeing, to, abandon, all, territorial, claims, in, the, mediterranean, and, beyond, limit, her, rights, to, expand, in, africa, recognize, massinissa, s, kingdom, give, up, all, but, twenty, of, her, ships, and, pay, a, war, indemnity, however, during, the, negotiations, the, carthaginians, suffering, from, starvation, attacked, a, roman, food, convoy, leading, to, protests, to, be, sent, and, envoys, exchanged, amid, further, attempts, to, remove, him, from, command, one, of, the, consuls, of, 203, bc, gnaeus, servilius, caepio, attempted, to, substitute, himself, for, scipio, to, claim, credit, for, the, final, blow, against, carthage, the, consuls, of, 202, bc, coveted, the, african, command, for, the, same, reason, scipio, refused, peace, terms, at, a, parley, with, hannibal, in, 202, bc, with, the, support, of, masinissa, s, numidian, cavalry, the, battle, of, zama, was, fought, shortly, after, the, romans, won, and, carthage, then, again, sued, for, peace, in, the, new, year, 201, bc, scipio, remained, in, africa, to, conclude, negotiations, which, saw, carthage, s, territory, kept, to, the, status, quo, ante, bellum, carthage, restore, to, the, romans, all, captured, goods, and, persons, carthaginian, disarmament, of, all, but, ten, triremes, and, carthage, needing, to, ask, for, roman, permission, to, make, any, war, massinissa, s, territory, in, numidia, was, to, be, confirmed, and, a, war, indemnity, of, 10, 000, talents, was, to, be, paid, over, the, next, fifty, years, although, the, consul, of, 201, bc, gnaeus, cornelius, lentulus, attempted, to, oppose, the, peace, so, that, he, could, continue, the, war, in, scipio, s, place, the, peace, terms, were, ratified, by, the, assembly, in, rome, bringing, the, war, to, a, final, close, on, his, return, scipio, celebrated, a, triumph, over, hannibal, the, carthaginians, and, syphax, there, he, took, the, agnomen, africanus, the, african, for, his, victories, by, this, point, scipio, s, career, reached, far, beyond, his, peers, even, though, he, was, only, in, his, early, thirties, on, his, return, he, deposited, some, 123, 000, pounds, of, silver, into, the, roman, treasury, and, distributed, 400, asses, each, to, his, soldiers, his, popularity, among, the, plebs, was, also, astonishing, the, scipionic, legend, which, in, later, forms, depicted, him, a, son, of, jupiter, and, heralded, great, political, success, this, success, however, turned, many, roman, aristocrats, into, his, enemies, largely, to, oppose, his, further, aggrandisement, or, out, of, jealousy, even, during, his, consulship, he, had, been, opposed, by, fabius, maximus, and, others, especially, after, stories, circulated, of, his, being, saluted, as, king, and, god, in, spain, his, intended, role, in, roman, politics, however, remained, traditional, in, the, year, 199, bc, scipio, was, elected, censor, with, publius, aelius, paetus, as, his, colleague, their, censorship, was, largely, unremarkable, but, saw, scipio, named, as, princeps, senatus, a, title, which, he, retained, for, the, next, two, lustra, after, this, point, the, classicist, howard, hayes, scullard, believed, that, scipio, s, political, position, entered, an, eclipse, this, is, disputed, after, the, required, ten, years, between, consulships, had, elapsed, scipio, secured, election, to, the, consulship, of, 194, bc, during, his, second, consulship, he, wanted, to, succeed, titus, quinctius, flamininus, in, greece, and, advocated, for, a, stronger, roman, presence, in, the, aegean, to, guard, against, antiochus, iii, but, was, unsuccessful, he, instead, fought, the, boii, and, ligurians, in, northern, italy, against, whom, the, romans, had, been, continuously, campaigning, since, 201, bc, scipio, let, his, co, consul, tiberius, sempronius, longus, take, the, leading, role, in, the, fighting, and, returned, to, rome, to, hold, the, consular, elections, in, 193, bc, scipio, is, said, to, have, taken, part, in, two, embassies, the, first, was, to, africa, where, he, was, one, of, three, sent, to, arbitrate, a, boundary, dispute, between, carthage, and, masinissa, the, commission, left, the, matter, undecided, possibly, on, purpose, the, second, embassy, is, said, to, have, been, to, asia, and, on, the, basis, of, travel, time, could, not, have, happened, during, the, alleged, embassy, scipio, is, apocryphally, said, to, have, discussed, the, best, generals, with, hannibal, at, ephesus, in, 192, bc, rome, declared, war, on, antiochus, who, after, a, cold, war, with, the, romans, starting, from, the, close, of, the, second, macedonian, war, through, to, 193, bc, had, invaded, greece, antiochus, initial, push, into, greece, was, met, with, little, enthusiasm, by, the, locals, who, were, well, treated, in, a, peaceful, and, largely, open, interstate, system, in, the, aftermath, of, the, roman, proclamation, of, greek, freedom, it, did, not, help, that, the, cities, that, he, did, take, had, to, be, taken, by, force, the, consul, of, 191, bc, manius, acilius, glabrio, arrived, in, the, spring, and, promptly, defeated, antiochus, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, antiochus, lost, the, battle, and, was, forced, back, across, the, aegean, to, ephesus, within, six, months, of, the, war, s, start, the, consul, of, 190, bc, was, scipio, africanus, brother, lucius, cornelius, scipio, who, was, assigned, by, the, senate, to, greece, with, permission, to, cross, into, asia, he, appointed, his, older, brother, scipio, africanus, as, one, of, his, legates, while, en, route, roman, armies, and, fleets, quickly, overwhelmed, antiochus, defences, forcing, him, to, retreat, from, the, hellespont, and, abydos, by, october, 190, bc, when, the, scipios, arrived, the, romans, had, an, army, in, asia, minor, antiochus, offered, terms, a, war, indemnity, to, cover, half, the, cost, of, the, war, and, abandonment, of, his, claims, to, smyrna, lapsacus, alexandria, troas, and, other, towns, but, the, scipiones, rejected, the, offer, based, on, the, roman, war, aim, of, reshaping, to, their, benefit, the, aegean, balance, of, power, they, responded, by, demanding, antiochus, cede, all, territory, to, the, taurus, mountains, and, pay, an, indemnity, covering, the, entire, cost, of, the, war, the, demands, were, so, extreme, he, immediately, broke, off, negotiations, late, in, the, year, around, mid, december, antiochus, forces, engaged, the, romans, at, magnesia, even, though, they, outnumbered, the, romans, and, allies, by, at, least, two, to, one, antiochus, army, of, some, 60, 000, men, was, routed, shortly, before, magnesia, antiochus, offered, scipio, africanus, a, bribe, to, secure, favourable, peace, terms, which, africanus, rejected, at, the, battle, itself, he, claimed, illness, but, was, selected, to, present, the, roman, peace, terms, regardless, the, credit, for, the, victory, accrued, to, his, brother, and, commander, lucius, the, peace, terms, presented, at, sardis, were, largely, the, roman, demands, prior, to, the, battle, antiochus, would, cede, all, territory, outside, the, taurus, line, eventually, determined, to, be, from, cape, sarpedon, in, cilicia, through, to, the, river, tanais, pay, a, war, indemnity, of, 15, 000, talents, to, rome, with, a, separate, 400, talents, to, eumenes, all, exiles, and, enemies, of, rome, would, be, handed, over, including, hannibal, along, with, twenty, hostages, including, antiochus, youngest, son, the, 190s, bc, saw, a, re, emergence, of, attempts, by, the, aristocratic, elite, to, put, limits, on, individual, ambitions, the, return, of, the, scipiones, to, rome, saw, claims, over, lucius, scipio, s, triumph, disputed, critics, thought, the, scipiones, had, been, fighting, a, weak, enemy, and, that, the, war, had, actually, truly, been, won, a, year, earlier, at, thermopylae, his, triumph, however, was, approved, regardless, lucius, attempt, to, secure, from, the, senate, a, prorogation, to, oversee, the, settlement, of, asia, also, was, rejected, no, exception, would, be, made, to, the, general, post, hannibalic, war, rule, against, promagistrates, lucius, scipio, adopted, the, cognomen, asiagenes, and, at, his, triumph, brought, some, 137, 420, pounds, of, silver, 224, 000, tetradrachms, 140, 000, gold, coins, 234, gold, crowns, 1231, ivory, tusks, and, more, into, the, city, his, soldiers, were, granted, bonuses, of, 25, denarii, each, with, more, to, officers, and, cavalry, these, enormous, amounts, of, plunder, triggered, moral, panic, at, rome, about, the, possible, diversion, of, those, funds, to, extravagant, private, use, these, troubles, related, to, the, broader, matter, of, charting, the, boundaries, of, power, that, magistrates, could, exercise, abroad, especially, in, relation, of, monies, obtained, in, war, a, confusing, mess, of, stories, related, to, the, scipiones, legal, troubles, are, recorded, in, the, ancient, sources, scipio, asiagenes, was, in, fact, indicted, he, was, not, alone, his, successor, in, asia, gnaeus, manlius, vulso, also, was, brought, up, on, charges, regardless, the, trial, forced, a, full, accounting, of, cash, paid, by, antiochus, to, manlius, and, asiagenes, after, asiagenes, was, fined, either, by, a, special, court, or, by, tribunician, legislation, he, refused, to, pay, the, fine, claiming, poverty, and, was, only, saved, from, prison, when, one, of, the, plebeian, tribunes, usually, identified, as, tiberius, sempronius, gracchus, interceded, africanus, was, around, the, same, time, challenged, in, the, senate, a, senator, demanded, that, he, produce, his, account, books, for, the, antiochene, campaign, and, account, for, the, monies, allotted, to, pay, his, troops, he, responded, with, indignation, and, declared, that, he, owed, no, reckoning, securing, the, account, books, from, his, brother, he, waved, them, before, the, senators, and, then, tore, them, up, asking, the, rhetorical, question, as, to, how, the, senate, could, be, concerned, with, a, mere, 3, 000, talents, when, he, had, brought, 15, 000, into, the, treasury, by, conquering, spain, africa, and, asia, one, story, given, by, valerius, antias, indicates, that, one, of, the, tribunes, at, the, urging, of, cato, the, elder, brought, charges, against, scipio, africanus, alleging, bribery, and, theft, antias, then, has, scipio, respond, with, a, rousing, oration, detailing, his, services, to, the, republic, and, noting, that, the, day, is, the, anniversary, of, the, battle, of, zama, at, this, notice, he, then, leads, an, impromptu, procession, to, sacrifice, at, the, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, amid, thunderous, applause, leaving, the, prosecutors, embarrassed, this, story, however, generates, little, confidence, the, legal, troubles, proved, little, trouble, for, the, scipiones, as, evidence, by, asiagenes, lavish, games, in, 186, and, vigorous, campaign, for, the, censorship, of, 184, he, was, unsuccessful, friends, of, the, scipiones, continued, to, win, consular, elections, scipio, himself, retired, to, liternum, the, idea, that, he, retired, in, semi, exile, or, ignominy, is, pure, romance, scipio, retired, to, his, country, seat, at, liternum, on, the, coast, of, campania, where, he, died, there, are, multiple, dates, reported, for, his, death, polybius, and, rutilius, who, both, lived, shortly, after, his, death, report, that, he, died, in, 183, bc, the, later, historian, valerius, antias, reported, that, he, died, in, 187, bc, livy, arguing, against, both, dates, in, his, history, believed, scipio, died, c, 185, bc, rejecting, both, dates, with, the, argument, that, if, scipio, lived, to, 183, he, would, be, noted, as, princeps, senatus, and, that, scipio, had, to, have, lived, to, 185, bc, to, have, been, prosecuted, by, the, naevius, who, was, tribune, in, that, year, however, most, modern, sources, such, as, the, oxford, classical, dictionary, prefer, 183, bc, it, is, not, clear, where, scipio, africanus, was, buried, there, are, three, main, possibilities, the, first, is, the, tomb, of, the, scipios, in, rome, nothing, survives, in, the, literary, record, documenting, his, burial, there, however, the, second, is, his, villa, at, liternum, it, was, later, owned, by, seneca, the, younger, who, in, a, letter, expressed, his, belief, that, an, altar, there, was, africanus, tomb, the, third, is, the, pyramidal, meta, romuli, which, was, ahistorically, dubbed, the, sepulcrum, scipionis, during, the, renaissance, scipio, married, aemilia, tertia, daughter, of, the, consul, lucius, aemilius, paullus, who, fell, at, cannae, she, was, also, the, sister, of, another, consul, lucius, aemilius, paullus, macedonicus, scipio, s, marriage, was, fruitful, they, had, three, sons, they, also, had, two, daughters, both, were, named, cornelia, the, elder, married, publius, cornelius, scipio, nasica, corculum, the, younger, cornelia, married, tiberius, sempronius, gracchus, and, became, mother, to, the, gracchi, brothers, tiberius, gracchus, and, gaius, gracchus, none, of, his, sons, had, legitimate, issue, however, his, son, publius, adopted, the, son, of, lucius, aemilius, paullus, macedonicus, who, became, known, as, scipio, aemilianus, scipio, s, only, descendants, living, through, the, late, republican, period, were, the, descendants, of, his, two, daughters, his, younger, daughter, s, last, surviving, child, sempronia, wife, and, then, widow, of, scipio, aemilianus, his, adoptive, grandson, was, alive, as, late, as, 102, bc, scipio, was, a, man, of, great, intellect, and, culture, who, could, speak, and, read, greek, wrote, his, own, memoirs, in, greek, and, became, also, noted, for, his, introduction, of, the, clean, shaven, face, fashion, among, the, romans, according, to, the, example, of, alexander, the, great, instead, of, wearing, the, beard, this, man, s, fashion, lasted, until, the, time, of, emperor, hadrian, r, 117, 138, then, was, revived, by, constantine, the, great, r, 306, 337, and, lasted, until, the, reign, of, emperor, phocas, r, 602, 610, who, again, introduced, the, wearing, of, the, beard, among, roman, emperors, he, also, enjoyed, the, reputation, of, being, a, graceful, orator, the, secret, of, his, sway, being, his, deep, self, confidence, and, radiant, sense, of, fairness, to, his, political, opponents, he, was, often, harsh, and, arrogant, but, towards, others, singularly, gracious, and, sympathetic, his, graecophile, lifestyle, and, his, unconventional, way, of, wearing, the, roman, toga, raised, much, opposition, among, some, senators, of, rome, led, by, cato, the, elder, who, felt, that, greek, influence, was, destroying, roman, culture, cato, as, a, loyalist, of, fabius, maximus, had, been, sent, out, as, quaestor, to, scipio, in, sicily, circa, 204, bc, to, investigate, charges, of, military, indiscipline, corruption, and, other, offence, against, scipio, none, of, those, charges, was, found, true, by, the, tribunes, of, the, plebs, accompanying, cato, it, may, or, may, not, be, significant, that, years, later, as, censor, cato, degraded, scipio, s, brother, scipio, asiaticus, from, the, senate, it, is, certainly, true, that, some, romans, of, the, day, viewed, cato, as, a, representative, of, the, old, romans, and, scipio, and, his, like, as, graecophiles, he, often, visited, the, temple, of, jupiter, and, made, offerings, there, there, was, a, belief, that, he, was, a, special, favourite, of, heaven, and, actually, communicated, with, the, gods, it, is, quite, possible, that, he, himself, honestly, shared, this, belief, however, the, strength, of, this, belief, is, evident, even, a, generation, later, when, his, adopted, grandson, publius, aemilianus, scipio, was, elected, to, the, consulship, from, the, office, of, tribune, his, rise, was, spectacular, and, letters, survive, from, soldiers, under, his, command, in, hispania, show, that, they, believed, that, he, possessed, the, same, abilities, as, his, grandfather, the, elder, scipio, was, a, spiritual, man, as, well, as, a, soldier, and, statesman, and, was, a, priest, of, mars, the, ability, which, he, is, supposed, to, have, possessed, is, called, by, the, old, name, second, sight, and, he, is, supposed, to, have, had, prescient, dreams, in, which, he, saw, the, future, livy, describes, this, belief, as, it, was, perceived, then, without, offering, his, opinion, as, to, its, veracity, polybius, made, a, case, that, scipio, s, successes, resulted, from, good, planning, rational, thinking, and, intelligence, which, he, said, was, a, higher, sign, of, the, gods, favour, than, prophetic, dreams, polybius, suggested, that, people, had, only, said, that, scipio, had, supernatural, powers, because, they, had, not, appreciated, the, natural, mental, gifts, which, facilitated, scipio, s, achievements, the, roman, historian, valerius, maximus, writing, in, the, first, century, ad, alleged, that, scipio, africanus, had, a, weakness, for, beautiful, women, and, knowing, this, some, of, his, soldiers, presented, him, with, a, beautiful, young, woman, captured, in, new, carthage, the, woman, turned, out, to, be, the, fianc, e, of, an, important, iberian, chieftain, and, scipio, chose, to, act, as, a, general, and, not, an, ordinary, soldier, in, restoring, her, virtue, and, ransom, intact, to, her, fianc, this, episode, was, frequently, depicted, by, painters, of, the, renaissance, and, early, modern, era, as, the, continence, of, scipio, according, to, valerius, maximus, scipio, had, a, relationship, from, c, 191, bc, with, one, of, his, own, serving, girls, which, his, wife, magnanimously, overlooked, the, affair, if, it, lasted, from, circa, 191, bc, to, scipio, s, death, 183, bc, might, have, resulted, in, issue, not, mentioned, what, is, mentioned, is, that, the, girl, was, freed, by, aemilia, paulla, after, scipio, s, death, and, married, to, one, of, his, freedmen, this, account, is, only, found, in, valerius, maximus, memorable, deeds, and, sayings, 6, 7, 1, 3, l, writing, in, the, first, century, ad, some, decades, after, livy, valerius, maximus, is, hostile, to, scipio, africanus, in, other, matters, such, as, his, frequent, visits, to, the, temple, of, jupiter, capitolinus, which, maximus, saw, as, fake, religion, scipio, is, said, to, have, written, his, memoirs, in, greek, but, those, are, lost, perhaps, destroyed, along, with, the, history, written, by, his, elder, son, and, namesake, adoptive, father, of, scipio, aemilianus, and, his, life, by, plutarch, as, a, result, contemporary, accounts, of, his, life, particularly, his, childhood, and, youth, are, virtually, non, existent, even, plutarch, s, account, of, scipio, s, life, written, much, later, has, been, lost, what, remains, are, accounts, of, his, doings, in, polybius, livy, s, histories, which, say, little, about, his, private, life, supplemented, with, the, surviving, histories, of, appian, and, cassius, dio, and, the, odd, anecdote, in, valerius, maximus, of, these, polybius, was, the, closest, to, scipio, africanus, in, age, and, in, connections, but, his, narrative, may, be, biased, by, his, friendship, with, scipio, s, close, relatives, and, that, the, primary, source, of, his, information, about, africanus, came, from, one, of, his, best, friends, gaius, laelius, scipio, is, considered, by, many, to, be, one, of, rome, s, greatest, generals, skillful, alike, in, strategy, and, in, tactics, he, had, also, the, faculty, of, inspiring, his, soldiers, with, confidence, livy, reports, that, as, a, roman, commissioner, to, ephesus, following, the, defeat, of, antiochus, iii, on, meeting, the, exiled, hannibal, scipio, took, the, opportunity, to, ask, hannibal, s, opinion, of, the, greatest, commander, to, which, hannibal, named, alexander, the, great, as, the, first, and, pyrrhus, as, the, second, livy, continues, on, scipio, s, again, asking, him, whom, he, regarded, as, the, third, hannibal, without, any, hesitation, replied, myself, scipio, smiled, and, asked, what, would, you, say, if, you, had, vanquished, me, in, that, case, replied, hannibal, i, should, say, that, i, surpassed, alexander, and, pyrrhus, and, all, other, commanders, in, the, world, scipio, was, delighted, with, the, turn, which, the, speaker, had, with, true, carthaginian, adroitness, given, to, his, answer, and, the, unexpected, flattery, it, conveyed, because, hannibal, had, set, him, apart, from, the, ordinary, run, of, military, captains, as, an, incomparable, commander, metellus, scipio, a, descendant, of, scipio, commanded, legions, against, julius, caesar, in, africa, until, his, defeat, at, the, battle, of, thapsus, in, 49, bc, popular, superstition, was, that, only, a, scipio, could, win, a, battle, in, africa, so, julius, caesar, assigned, a, distant, relative, of, metellus, to, his, staff, in, order, to, say, that, he, too, had, a, scipio, fighting, for, him, scipio, was, the, first, roman, general, to, expand, roman, territories, outside, italy, and, islands, around, the, italian, mainland, he, conquered, the, carthaginian, territory, of, iberia, for, rome, although, the, two, iberian, provinces, were, not, fully, pacified, for, a, couple, of, centuries, his, defeat, of, hannibal, at, zama, paved, the, way, for, carthage, s, eventual, destruction, in, 146, bc, his, interest, in, a, graecophile, lifestyle, had, tremendous, influence, on, the, roman, elite, more, than, a, century, later, even, the, conservative, cato, uticensis, great, grandson, of, the, elder, cato, espoused, greek, philosophy, scipio, did, not, introduce, greek, ideas, or, art, to, the, romans, but, his, ardent, support, for, the, greek, way, of, life, coupled, with, his, own, charisma, had, its, inevitable, impact, less, beneficially, the, scipios, may, have, led, the, way, in, the, inevitable, chasm, that, grew, up, between, the, roman, elite, and, the, roman, masses, in, terms, of, the, way, the, elite, was, educated, and, lived, and, in, the, amount, of, wealth, they, possessed, scipio, supported, land, distribution, for, his, veterans, in, a, tradition, harking, back, to, the, earliest, days, of, the, republic, yet, his, actions, were, seen, as, somewhat, radical, by, conservatives, in, being, a, successful, general, who, demanded, lands, for, his, soldiers, scipio, may, have, led, the, way, for, later, generals, such, as, gaius, marius, and, julius, caesar, unlike, marius, or, caesar, however, he, did, not, seek, to, use, his, charisma, and, reputation, to, weaken, the, republic, the, true, measure, of, scipio, s, character, in, this, regard, can, perhaps, be, seen, by, his, behaviour, shortly, after, returning, in, triumph, from, africa, to, a, grateful, rome, scipio, refused, to, accept, demands, for, him, to, become, perpetual, consul, and, dictator, for, his, self, restraint, in, putting, the, good, of, the, republic, ahead, of, his, own, gain, scipio, was, praised, by, livy, for, showing, uncommon, greatness, of, mind, an, example, conspicuously, not, emulated, by, marius, sulla, or, caesar, the, relatives, of, scipio, continued, to, dominate, the, republic, for, a, couple, of, generations, this, domination, came, to, an, end, in, the, tumults, between, the, gracchi, brothers, who, were, his, grandsons, and, their, other, relatives, in, the, period, from, 133, to, 122, bc, the, gracchi, brothers, championed, land, redistribution, in, order, to, boost, the, ranks, of, potential, roman, soldiers, as, roman, soldiers, needed, to, own, land, to, be, enfranchised, for, service, in, the, legions, and, the, number, of, roman, land, owners, was, withering, they, were, lynched, by, their, relatives, who, disapproved, of, their, methods, and, perhaps, had, economic, reasons, to, fear, the, land, redistribution, after, the, fall, of, the, gracchi, the, house, of, caecilius, became, more, prominent, however, the, scipiones, maintained, their, aristocratic, lustre, providing, the, consular, general, who, unsuccessfully, prevented, sulla, s, second, march, on, rome, and, metellus, scipio, whose, daughter, was, the, last, wife, of, pompey, the, great, and, who, took, over, command, in, the, civil, war, against, julius, caesar, after, the, death, of, pompey, the, granddaughter, of, gaius, gracchus, fulvia, was, also, unusually, prominent, for, a, roman, woman, in, the, affairs, of, the, late, republic, marrying, publius, clodius, gaius, curio, and, mark, antony, in, turn, at, a, later, date, some, roman, emperors, claimed, descent, from, scipio, africanus, scipio, appears, or, is, mentioned, in, passing, in, cicero, s, de, republica, and, de, amicitia, and, in, silius, italicus, punica, cicero, was, mentored, by, prominent, romans, whose, ancestors, had, been, associated, with, scipio, as, a, roman, hero, scipio, appears, in, book, vi, of, the, aeneid, where, he, is, shown, to, aeneas, in, a, vision, in, the, underworld, scipio, figures, prominently, in, livy, s, ab, urbe, condita, libri, and, is, named, as, an, example, of, a,

in, paradiso, cantos, vi, and, xxvii, scipio, is, the, hero, of, petrarch, s, latin, epic, africa, the, continence, of, scipio, was, a, stock, motif, in, exemplary, literature, and, art, as, was, the, dream, of, scipio, portraying, his, allegorical, choice, between, virtue, and, luxury, the, continence, of, scipio, depicting, his, clemency, and, sexual, restraint, after, the, fall, of, carthago, nova, was, an, even, more, popular, subject, versions, of, the, subject, were, painted, by, many, artists, from, the, renaissance, through, to, the, 19th, century, including, andrea, mantegna, and,
