by, isis, ta, hemdjert, usermaatre, meryamun, ramesses, iii, was, the, second, pharaoh, of, the, twentieth, dynasty, in, ancient, egypt, some, scholars, date, his, reign, from, 26, march, 1186, to, 15, april, 1155, bc, and, he, is, considered, the, last, pharaoh, of, the, new, kingdom, to, have, wielded, substantial, power, his, long, reign, saw, the, decline, of, egyptian, political, and, economic, power, linked, to, a, series, of, invasions, and, internal, economic, problems, that, also, plagued, pharaohs, before, him, this, coincided, with, a, decline, in, the, cultural, sphere, of, ancient, egypt, however, his, successful, defense, was, able, to, slow, down, the, decline, although, it, still, meant, that, his, successors, would, have, a, weaker, military, he, has, also, been, described, as, a, warrior, pharaoh, due, to, his, strong, military, strategies, he, led, the, way, by, defeating, the, invaders, known, as, the, sea, peoples, who, had, caused, destruction, in, other, civilizations, and, empires, he, was, able, to, save, egypt, from, collapsing, at, the, time, when, many, other, empires, fell, during, the, late, bronze, age, however, the, damage, of, the, invasions, took, a, toll, on, egypt, rameses, iii, constructed, one, of, the, largest, mortuary, temples, of, western, thebes, now, called, medinet, habu, he, was, assassinated, in, the, harem, conspiracy, led, by, his, secondary, wife, tiye, and, her, eldest, son, pentawere, this, would, ultimately, cause, a, succession, crisis, which, would, further, accelerate, the, decline, of, ancient, egypt, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, and, designated, successor, ramesses, iv, although, many, of, his, other, sons, would, rule, later, ramesses, also, written, ramses, and, rameses, two, main, names, transliterate, as, wsr, m, t, r, mry, mn, r, ms, s, wnw, they, are, normally, realised, as, usermaatre, meryamun, rameses, heqaiunu, meaning, the, ma, at, of, ra, is, strong, beloved, of, amun, born, of, ra, ruler, of, heliopolis, ramesses, iii, was, the, son, of, setnakhte, and, tiy, merenese, who, wrote, her, name, in, a, cartouche, ramesses, iii, is, believed, to, have, reigned, from, march, 1186, to, april, 1155, bc, this, is, based, on, his, known, accession, date, of, i, shemu, day, 26, and, his, death, on, year, 32, iii, shemu, day, 15, some, scholars, estimate, a, reign, of, 31, years, 1, month, and, 19, days, alternative, dates, for, his, reign, are, 1187, 1156, bc, in, a, description, of, his, coronation, from, medinet, habu, four, doves, were, said, to, be, dispatched, to, the, four, corners, of, the, horizon, to, confirm, that, the, living, horus, ramses, iii, is, still, in, possession, of, his, throne, that, the, order, of, maat, prevails, in, the, cosmos, and, society, during, his, long, tenure, in, the, midst, of, the, surrounding, political, chaos, of, the, late, bronze, age, collapse, egypt, was, beset, by, foreign, invaders, including, the, so, called, sea, peoples, and, the, libyans, and, experienced, the, beginnings, of, increasing, economic, difficulties, and, internal, strife, which, would, eventually, lead, to, the, collapse, of, the, twentieth, dynasty, in, year, 8, of, his, reign, the, sea, peoples, including, peleset, denyen, shardana, meshwesh, of, the, sea, and, tjekker, invaded, egypt, by, land, and, sea, ramesses, iii, defeated, them, in, two, great, land, and, sea, battles, first, he, defeated, them, on, land, in, the, battle, of, djahy, on, the, egyptian, empire, s, easternmost, frontier, in, djahy, or, modern, day, southern, lebanon, the, second, one, was, the, battle, of, the, delta, in, which, ramesses, enticed, the, sea, peoples, and, their, ships, into, the, mouth, of, the, nile, where, he, had, assembled, a, fleet, in, ambush, although, the, egyptians, had, a, reputation, as, poor, seamen, they, fought, tenaciously, rameses, lined, the, shores, with, ranks, of, archers, who, kept, up, a, continuous, volley, of, arrows, into, the, enemy, ships, when, they, attempted, to, land, on, the, banks, of, the, nile, then, the, egyptian, navy, attacked, using, grappling, hooks, to, haul, in, the, enemy, ships, in, the, brutal, hand, to, hand, fighting, which, ensued, the, sea, peoples, were, utterly, defeated, the, harris, papyrus, states, as, for, those, who, reached, my, frontier, their, seed, is, not, their, heart, and, their, soul, are, finished, forever, and, ever, as, for, those, who, came, forward, together, on, the, seas, the, full, flame, was, in, front, of, them, at, the, nile, mouths, while, a, stockade, of, lances, surrounded, them, on, the, shore, prostrated, on, the, beach, slain, and, made, into, heaps, from, head, to, tail, ramesses, iii, incorporated, the, sea, peoples, as, subject, peoples, and, settled, them, in, southern, canaan, their, presence, in, canaan, may, have, contributed, to, the, formation, of, new, states, in, this, region, such, as, philistia, after, the, collapse, of, the, egyptian, empire, in, asia, during, the, reign, of, ramses, iii, egyptian, presence, in, the, levant, is, still, attested, as, far, as, byblos, and, he, may, have, campaigned, further, north, into, syria, ramesses, iii, was, also, compelled, to, fight, invading, libyan, tribesmen, in, two, major, campaigns, in, egypt, s, western, delta, in, his, year, 5, and, year, 11, respectively, by, the, early, 12th, century, egypt, claimed, overlordship, of, cyrenaican, tribes, at, one, point, a, ruler, chosen, by, egypt, was, set, up, briefly, over, the, combined, tribes, of, meshwesh, libu, and, soped, the, heavy, cost, of, these, battles, slowly, exhausted, egypt, s, treasury, and, contributed, to, the, gradual, decline, of, the, egyptian, empire, in, asia, the, severity, of, these, difficulties, is, stressed, by, the, fact, that, the, first, known, labour, strike, in, recorded, history, occurred, during, year, 29, of, ramesses, iii, s, reign, when, the, food, rations, for, the, favoured, and, elite, royal, tomb, builders, and, artisans, in, the, village, of, set, maat, her, imenty, waset, now, known, as, deir, el, medina, could, not, be, provisioned, something, in, the, air, possibly, the, hekla, 3, eruption, prevented, much, sunlight, from, reaching, the, ground, and, also, arrested, global, tree, growth, for, almost, two, full, decades, until, 1140, bc, the, result, in, egypt, was, a, substantial, increase, in, grain, prices, under, the, later, reigns, of, ramesses, vi, vii, whereas, the, prices, for, fowl, and, slaves, remained, constant, thus, the, cooldown, affected, ramesses, iii, s, final, years, and, impaired, his, ability, to, provide, a, constant, supply, of, grain, rations, to, the, workmen, of, the, deir, el, medina, community, these, difficult, realities, are, completely, ignored, in, ramesses, official, monuments, many, of, which, seek, to, emulate, those, of, his, famous, predecessor, ramesses, ii, and, which, present, an, image, of, continuity, and, stability, he, built, important, additions, to, the, temples, at, luxor, and, karnak, and, his, funerary, temple, and, administrative, complex, at, medinet, habu, is, amongst, the, largest, and, best, preserved, in, egypt, however, the, uncertainty, of, ramesses, times, is, apparent, from, the, massive, fortifications, which, were, built, to, enclose, the, latter, no, temple, in, the, heart, of, egypt, prior, to, ramesses, reign, had, ever, needed, to, be, protected, in, such, a, manner, thanks, to, the, discovery, of, papyrus, trial, transcripts, dated, to, ramesses, iii, it, is, now, known, that, there, was, a, plot, against, his, life, as, a, result, of, a, royal, harem, conspiracy, during, a, celebration, at, medinet, habu, on, day, 15, of, month, 2, of, shemu, 1155, bce, the, conspiracy, was, instigated, by, tiye, one, of, his, three, known, wives, the, others, being, tyti, and, iset, ta, hemdjert, over, whose, son, would, inherit, the, throne, tyti, s, son, ramesses, amenherkhepshef, the, future, ramesses, iv, was, the, eldest, and, the, successor, chosen, by, ramesses, iii, in, preference, to, tiye, s, son, pentaweret, the, trial, documents, show, that, many, individuals, were, implicated, in, the, plot, chief, among, them, were, queen, tiye, and, her, son, pentaweret, ramesses, chief, of, the, chamber, pebekkamen, seven, royal, butlers, a, respectable, state, office, two, treasury, overseers, two, army, standard, bearers, two, royal, scribes, and, a, herald, there, is, little, doubt, that, all, of, the, main, conspirators, were, executed, some, of, the, condemned, were, given, the, option, of, committing, suicide, possibly, by, poison, rather, than, being, put, to, death, according, to, the, surviving, trial, transcripts, a, total, of, three, separate, trials, were, started, while, 38, people, were, sentenced, to, death, the, tombs, of, tiye, and, her, son, pentaweret, were, robbed, and, their, names, erased, to, prevent, them, from, enjoying, an, afterlife, the, egyptians, did, such, a, thorough, job, of, this, that, the, only, references, to, them, are, the, trial, documents, and, what, remains, of, their, tombs, some, of, the, accused, harem, women, tried, to, seduce, the, members, of, the, judiciary, who, tried, them, but, were, caught, in, the, act, judges, who, were, involved, were, severely, punished, ramesses, iv, the, king, s, designated, successor, assumed, the, throne, upon, his, death, rather, than, pentaweret, who, was, intended, to, be, the, main, beneficiary, of, the, palace, conspiracy, moreover, ramesses, iii, died, in, his, 32nd, year, before, the, summaries, of, the, sentences, were, composed, but, the, same, year, that, the, trial, documents, record, the, trial, and, execution, of, the, conspirators, although, it, was, long, believed, that, ramesses, iii, s, body, showed, no, obvious, wounds, an, examination, of, the, mummy, by, a, german, forensic, team, televised, in, the, documentary, ramesses, mummy, king, mystery, on, the, science, channel, in, 2011, showed, excessive, bandages, around, the, neck, a, subsequent, ct, scan, that, was, done, in, egypt, by, ashraf, selim, and, sahar, saleem, professors, of, radiology, at, cairo, university, revealed, that, beneath, the, bandages, was, a, deep, knife, wound, across, the, throat, deep, enough, to, reach, the, vertebrae, according, to, the, documentary, narrator, it, was, a, wound, no, one, could, have, survived, the, ct, scan, revealed, that, his, throat, was, cut, to, the, bone, severing, the, trachea, esophagus, and, blood, vessels, which, would, have, been, rapidly, fatal, the, december, 2012, issue, of, the, british, medical, journal, quoted, the, conclusion, of, the, study, of, the, team, of, researchers, led, by, zahi, hawass, the, former, head, of, the, egyptian, supreme, council, of, antiquity, and, his, egyptian, team, as, well, as, albert, zink, from, the, institute, for, mummies, and, the, iceman, of, eurac, research, in, bolzano, italy, which, stated, that, conspirators, murdered, ramesses, iii, by, cutting, his, throat, zink, observed, in, an, interview, that, the, cut, is, very, deep, and, quite, large, it, really, goes, down, almost, down, to, the, bone, spine, it, must, have, been, a, lethal, injury, a, subsequent, study, of, the, ct, scan, of, the, mummy, of, ramesses, iii, s, body, by, sahar, saleem, revealed, that, the, left, big, toe, was, likely, chopped, by, a, heavy, sharp, object, like, an, ax, there, were, no, signs, of, bone, healing, so, this, injury, must, have, happened, shortly, before, death, the, embalmers, placed, a, prosthesis, like, object, made, of, linen, in, place, of, the, amputated, toe, the, embalmers, placed, six, amulets, around, both, feet, and, ankles, for, magical, healing, of, the, wound, for, the, life, after, this, additional, injury, of, the, foot, supports, the, assassination, of, the, pharaoh, likely, by, the, hands, of, multiple, assailants, using, different, weapons, before, this, discovery, it, had, been, speculated, that, ramesses, iii, had, been, killed, by, means, that, would, not, have, left, a, mark, on, the, body, among, the, conspirators, were, practitioners, of, magic, who, might, well, have, used, poison, some, had, put, forth, a, hypothesis, that, a, snakebite, from, a, viper, was, the, cause, of, the, king, s, death, his, mummy, includes, an, amulet, to, protect, ramesses, iii, in, the, afterlife, from, snakes, the, servant, in, charge, of, his, food, and, drink, were, also, among, the, listed, conspirators, but, there, were, also, other, conspirators, who, were, called, the, snake, and, the, lord, of, snakes, in, one, respect, the, conspirators, certainly, failed, the, crown, passed, to, the, king, s, designated, successor, ramesses, iv, ramesses, iii, may, have, been, doubtful, as, to, the, latter, s, chances, of, succeeding, him, given, that, in, the, great, harris, papyrus, he, implored, amun, to, ensure, his, son, s, rights, the, zink, unit, determined, that, the, mummy, of, an, unknown, man, buried, with, ramesses, was, because, of, the, proven, genetic, relationship, and, a, mummification, process, that, suggested, punishment, a, good, candidate, for, the, pharaoh, s, son, pentaweret, who, was, the, only, son, to, revolt, against, his, father, it, was, impossible, to, determine, his, cause, of, death, both, mummies, were, predicted, by, whit, athey, s, str, predictor, to, share, the, y, chromosomal, haplogroup, e1b1a, v38, and, 50, of, their, genetic, material, which, pointed, to, a, father, son, relationship, in, 2010, hawass, et, al, undertook, detailed, anthropological, radiological, and, genetic, studies, as, part, of, the, king, tutankhamun, family, project, the, objectives, included, attempting, to, determine, familial, relationships, among, 11, royal, mummies, of, the, new, kingdom, as, well, to, research, for, pathological, features, including, potential, inherited, disorders, and, infectious, diseases, in, 2012, hawass, et, al, undertook, an, anthropological, forensic, radiological, and, genetic, study, of, the, 20th, dynasty, mummies, of, ramesses, iii, and, an, unknown, man, which, were, found, together, in, 2022, s, o, y, keita, analysed, 8, short, tandem, loci, str, data, published, as, part, of, these, studies, by, hawass, et, al, using, an, algorithm, that, only, has, three, choices, eurasians, sub, saharan, africans, and, east, asians, using, these, three, options, keita, concluded, that, the, majority, of, the, samples, which, included, the, genetic, remains, of, rameses, iii, and, tutankhamun, had, a, population, affinity, with, sub, saharan, africans, in, one, affinity, analysis, however, keita, cautioned, that, this, does, not, mean, that, the, royal, mummies, lacked, other, affiliations, which, he, argued, had, been, obscured, in, typological, thinking, keita, further, added, that, different, data, and, algorithms, might, give, different, results, which, reflects, the, complexity, of, biological, heritage, and, the, associated, interpretation, the, great, harris, papyrus, or, papyrus, harris, i, which, was, commissioned, by, his, son, and, chosen, successor, ramesses, iv, chronicles, this, king, s, vast, donations, of, land, gold, statues, and, monumental, construction, to, egypt, s, various, temples, at, piramesse, heliopolis, memphis, athribis, hermopolis, this, abydos, coptos, el, kab, and, various, cities, in, nubia, it, also, records, that, the, king, dispatched, a, trading, expedition, to, the, land, of, punt, and, quarried, the, copper, mines, of, timna, in, southern, canaan, papyrus, harris, i, records, some, of, ramesses, iii, s, activities, i, sent, my, emissaries, to, the, land, of, atika, to, the, great, copper, mines, which, are, there, their, ships, carried, them, along, and, others, went, overland, on, their, donkeys, it, had, not, been, heard, of, since, the, king, their, mines, were, found, and, yielded, copper, which, was, loaded, by, tens, of, thousands, into, their, ships, they, being, sent, in, their, care, to, egypt, and, arriving, safely, p, harris, i, 78, 1, 4, ramesses, began, the, reconstruction, of, the, temple, of, khonsu, at, karnak, from, the, foundations, of, an, earlier, temple, of, amenhotep, iii, and, completed, the, temple, of, medinet, habu, around, his, year, 12, he, decorated, the, walls, of, his, medinet, habu, temple, with, scenes, of, his, naval, and, land, battles, against, the, sea, peoples, this, monument, stands, today, as, one, of, the, best, preserved, temples, of, the, new, kingdom, the, mummy, of, ramesses, iii, was, discovered, by, antiquarians, in, 1886, and, is, regarded, as, the, prototypical, egyptian, mummy, in, numerous, hollywood, movies, his, tomb, kv11, is, one, of, the, largest, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, in, 1980, james, harris, and, edward, f, wente, conducted, a, series, of, x, ray, examinations, on, new, kingdom, pharaohs, crania, and, skeletal, remains, which, included, the, mummified, remains, of, ramesses, iii, the, analysis, in, general, found, strong, similarities, between, the, new, kingdom, rulers, of, the, 19th, dynasty, and, 20th, dynasty, with, mesolithic, nubian, samples, the, authors, also, noted, affinities, with, modern, mediterranean, populations, of, levantine, origin, harris, and, wente, suggested, this, represented, admixture, as, the, rammessides, were, of, northern, origin, in, april, 2021, his, mummy, was, moved, from, the, museum, of, egyptian, antiquities, to, the, national, museum, of, egyptian, civilization, along, with, those, of, 17, other, kings, and, 4, queens, in, an, event, termed, the, pharaohs, golden, parade, there, is, uncertainty, regarding, the, exact, dates, of, the, reign, of, ramesses, iii, this, uncertainty, affects, the, dating, of, the, late, bronze, iron, age, transition, in, the, levant, this, transition, is, defined, by, the, appearance, of, mycenaean, lh, iiic, 1b, philistine, pottery, in, the, coastal, plain, of, palestine, generally, assumed, to, correspond, to, the, settlement, of, sea, peoples, there, at, the, 8th, year, of, ramesses, iii, radiocarbon, dates, and, other, external, evidence, permit, this, transition, to, be, as, late, as, 1100, bc, compared, to, the, conventional, dating, of, c, 1179, bc, some, scientists, have, tried, to, establish, a, chronological, point, for, this, pharaoh, s, reign, at, 1159, bc, based, on, a, 1999, dating, of, the, hekla, 3, eruption, of, the, hekla, volcano, in, iceland, since, contemporary, records, show, that, the, king, experienced, difficulties, provisioning, his, workmen, at, deir, el, medina, with, supplies, in, his, 29th, year, this, dating, of, hekla, 3, might, connect, his, 28th, or, 29th, regnal, year, to, c, 1159, bc, a, minor, discrepancy, of, one, year, is, possible, since, egypt, s, granaries, could, have, had, reserves, to, cope, with, at, least, a, single, bad, year, of, crop, harvests, following, the, onset, of, the, disaster, this, implies, that, the, king, s, reign, would, have, ended, just, three, to, four, years, later, around, 1156, or, 1155, bc, a, rival, date, of, 2900, bp, 950, bc, has, since, been, proposed, by, scientists, based, on, a, re, examination, of, the, volcanic, layer, given, that, no, egyptologist, dates, ramesses, iii, s, reign, to, as, late, as, 1000, bc, this, would, mean, that, the, hekla, 3, eruption, presumably, occurred, well, after, ramesses, iii, s, reign, a, 2002, study, using, high, precision, radiocarbon, dating, of, a, peat, deposit, containing,
