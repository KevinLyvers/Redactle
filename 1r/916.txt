the, forerunner, in, eastern, orthodoxy, and, oriental, orthodoxy, john, the, immerser, in, some, baptist, christian, traditions, saint, john, by, certain, catholic, churches, and, prophet, yahya, in, islam, he, is, sometimes, alternatively, referred, to, as, john, the, baptiser, john, is, mentioned, by, the, roman, jewish, historian, josephus, and, he, is, revered, as, a, major, religious, figure, in, christianity, islam, the, bah, faith, the, druze, faith, and, mandaeism, the, latter, in, which, he, is, considered, to, be, the, final, and, most, vital, prophet, he, is, considered, to, be, a, prophet, of, god, by, all, of, the, aforementioned, faiths, and, is, honoured, as, a, saint, in, many, christian, denominations, according, to, the, new, testament, john, anticipated, a, messianic, figure, greater, than, himself, in, the, gospels, he, is, portrayed, as, the, precursor, or, forerunner, of, jesus, according, to, the, gospel, of, matthew, jesus, himself, identifies, john, as, elijah, who, is, to, come, which, is, a, direct, reference, to, the, book, of, malachi, malachi, 4, 5, as, confirmed, by, the, angel, who, announced, john, s, birth, to, his, father, zechariah, according, to, the, gospel, of, luke, john, and, jesus, were, relatives, some, scholars, maintain, that, john, belonged, to, the, essenes, a, semi, ascetic, jewish, sect, who, expected, a, messiah, and, practised, ritual, baptism, john, used, baptism, as, the, central, symbol, or, sacrament, of, his, pre, messianic, movement, most, biblical, scholars, agree, that, john, baptized, jesus, and, several, new, testament, accounts, report, that, some, of, jesus, s, early, followers, had, previously, been, followers, of, john, according, to, the, new, testament, john, was, sentenced, to, death, and, subsequently, beheaded, by, herod, antipas, around, ad, 30, after, john, rebuked, him, for, divorcing, his, wife, phasaelis, and, then, unlawfully, wedding, herodias, the, wife, of, his, brother, herod, philip, i, josephus, also, mentions, john, in, the, antiquities, of, the, jews, and, states, that, he, was, executed, by, order, of, herod, antipas, in, the, fortress, at, machaerus, followers, of, john, existed, well, into, the, 2nd, century, ad, and, some, proclaimed, him, to, be, the, messiah, awaited, by, jews, in, modern, times, the, followers, of, john, the, baptist, are, the, mandaeans, an, ancient, ethnoreligious, group, who, believe, that, he, is, their, greatest, and, final, prophet, in, the, roman, martyrology, apart, from, jesus, and, the, virgin, mary, john, is, the, only, saint, whose, birth, and, death, are, both, commemorated, john, the, baptist, is, mentioned, in, all, four, canonical, gospels, and, the, non, canonical, gospel, of, the, nazarenes, the, synoptic, gospels, mark, matthew, and, luke, describe, john, baptising, jesus, in, the, gospel, of, john, this, is, inferred, by, many, to, be, referred, to, in, john, 1, 32, the, gospel, of, mark, introduces, john, as, a, fulfillment, of, a, prophecy, from, the, book, of, isaiah, in, fact, a, conflation, of, texts, from, isaiah, malachi, and, exodus, about, a, messenger, being, sent, ahead, and, a, voice, crying, out, in, the, wilderness, john, is, described, as, wearing, clothes, of, camel, s, hair, and, living, on, locusts, and, wild, honey, john, proclaims, baptism, of, repentance, for, the, forgiveness, of, sin, and, says, another, will, come, after, him, who, will, not, baptize, with, water, but, with, the, holy, spirit, jesus, comes, to, john, and, is, baptized, by, him, in, the, river, jordan, the, account, describes, how, as, he, emerges, from, the, water, jesus, sees, the, heavens, open, and, the, holy, spirit, descends, on, him, like, a, dove, and, he, hears, a, voice, from, heaven, that, says, you, are, my, son, the, beloved, with, you, i, am, well, pleased, later, in, the, gospel, there, is, an, account, of, john, s, death, it, is, introduced, by, an, incident, where, the, tetrarch, herod, antipas, hearing, stories, about, jesus, imagines, that, this, is, john, the, baptist, raised, from, the, dead, it, then, explains, that, john, had, rebuked, herod, for, marrying, herodias, the, ex, wife, of, his, brother, named, here, as, philip, herodias, demands, his, execution, but, herod, who, liked, to, listen, to, john, is, reluctant, to, do, so, because, he, fears, him, knowing, he, is, a, righteous, and, holy, man, the, account, then, describes, how, herodias, s, unnamed, daughter, dances, before, herod, who, is, pleased, and, offers, her, anything, she, asks, for, in, return, when, the, girl, asks, her, mother, what, she, should, request, she, is, told, to, demand, the, head, of, john, the, baptist, reluctantly, herod, orders, the, beheading, of, john, and, his, head, is, delivered, to, her, at, her, request, on, a, plate, john, s, disciples, take, the, body, away, and, bury, it, in, a, tomb, the, gospel, refers, to, antipas, as, king, and, the, ex, husband, of, herodias, is, named, as, philip, but, he, is, known, to, have, been, called, herod, although, the, wording, clearly, implies, the, girl, was, the, daughter, of, herodias, many, texts, describe, her, as, herod, s, daughter, herodias, since, these, texts, are, early, and, significant, and, the, reading, is, difficult, many, scholars, see, this, as, the, original, version, altered, in, later, versions, and, in, matthew, and, luke, josephus, says, that, herodias, had, a, daughter, by, the, name, of, salome, scholars, have, speculated, about, the, origins, of, the, story, since, it, shows, signs, of, having, been, composed, in, aramaic, which, mark, apparently, did, not, speak, he, is, likely, to, have, got, it, from, a, palestinian, source, there, are, a, variety, of, opinions, about, how, much, actual, historical, material, it, contains, especially, given, the, alleged, factual, errors, many, scholars, have, seen, the, story, of, john, arrested, executed, and, buried, in, a, tomb, as, a, conscious, foreshadowing, of, the, fate, of, jesus, the, gospel, of, matthew, account, begins, with, the, same, modified, quotation, from, isaiah, moving, the, malachi, and, exodus, material, to, later, in, the, text, where, it, is, quoted, by, jesus, the, description, of, john, is, possibly, taken, directly, from, mark, clothing, of, camel, s, hair, with, a, leather, belt, around, his, waist, and, his, food, was, locusts, and, wild, honey, along, with, the, proclamation, that, one, was, coming, who, would, baptize, with, the, holy, spirit, and, fire, the, book, of, matthew, next, has, jesus, coming, to, john, to, be, baptized, but, john, objects, because, he, is, not, worthy, because, jesus, is, the, one, that, brings, the, baptism, in, the, spirit, unlike, mark, matthew, describes, john, as, critical, of, pharisees, and, sadducees, and, as, preaching, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, at, hand, and, a, coming, judgment, matthew, shortens, the, account, of, the, beheading, of, john, and, adds, two, elements, that, herod, antipas, wants, john, dead, and, that, the, death, is, reported, to, jesus, by, his, disciples, matthew, s, approach, is, to, shift, the, focus, away, from, herod, and, onto, john, as, a, prototype, of, jesus, where, mark, has, herod, killing, john, reluctantly, and, at, herodias, insistence, matthew, describes, him, as, wanting, john, dead, the, gospel, of, luke, adds, an, account, of, john, s, infancy, introducing, him, as, the, miraculous, son, of, zechariah, an, old, priest, and, his, wife, elizabeth, who, was, past, menopause, and, therefore, unable, to, have, children, according, to, this, account, the, birth, of, john, was, foretold, by, the, angel, gabriel, to, zechariah, while, he, was, performing, his, functions, as, a, priest, in, the, temple, of, jerusalem, since, he, is, described, as, a, priest, of, the, course, of, abijah, and, elizabeth, as, one, of, the, daughters, of, aaron, this, would, make, john, a, descendant, of, aaron, on, both, his, father, s, and, mother, s, side, on, the, basis, of, this, account, the, catholic, as, well, as, the, anglican, and, lutheran, liturgical, calendars, placed, the, feast, of, the, nativity, of, john, the, baptist, on, 24, june, six, months, before, christmas, elizabeth, is, described, as, a, relative, of, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, in, luke, 1, 36, there, is, no, mention, of, a, family, relationship, between, john, and, jesus, in, the, other, gospels, and, raymond, e, brown, has, described, it, as, of, dubious, historicity, g, za, vermes, has, called, it, artificial, and, undoubtedly, luke, s, creation, the, many, similarities, between, the, gospel, of, luke, story, of, the, birth, of, john, and, the, old, testament, account, of, the, birth, of, samuel, suggest, that, luke, s, account, of, the, annunciation, and, birth, of, jesus, are, modeled, on, that, of, samuel, unique, to, the, gospel, of, luke, john, the, baptist, explicitly, teaches, charity, baptizes, tax, collectors, and, advises, soldiers, the, text, briefly, mentions, that, john, is, imprisoned, and, later, beheaded, by, herod, but, the, gospel, of, luke, lacks, the, story, of, a, step, daughter, dancing, for, herod, and, requesting, john, s, head, the, book, of, acts, portrays, some, disciples, of, john, becoming, followers, of, jesus, a, development, not, reported, by, the, gospels, except, for, the, early, case, of, andrew, simon, peter, s, brother, the, fourth, gospel, describes, john, the, baptist, as, a, man, sent, from, god, who, was, not, the, light, but, came, as, a, witness, to, bear, witness, to, the, light, so, that, through, him, everyone, might, believe, john, confirms, that, he, is, not, the, christ, nor, elijah, nor, the, prophet, when, asked, by, jewish, priests, and, pharisees, instead, he, described, himself, as, the, voice, of, one, crying, in, the, wilderness, upon, literary, analysis, it, is, clear, that, john, is, the, testifier, and, confessor, par, excellence, particularly, when, compared, to, figures, like, nicodemus, jesus, s, baptism, is, implied, but, not, depicted, unlike, the, other, gospels, it, is, john, himself, who, testifies, to, seeing, the, spirit, come, down, from, heaven, like, a, dove, and, rest, on, him, john, explicitly, announces, that, jesus, is, the, one, who, baptizes, with, the, holy, spirit, and, john, even, professes, a, belief, that, he, is, the, son, of, god, and, the, lamb, of, god, the, gospel, of, john, reports, that, jesus, disciples, were, baptizing, and, that, a, debate, broke, out, between, some, of, the, disciples, of, john, and, another, jew, about, purification, in, this, debate, john, argued, that, jesus, must, become, greater, while, he, john, must, become, less, the, gospel, of, john, then, points, out, that, jesus, disciples, were, baptizing, more, people, than, john, later, the, gospel, relates, that, jesus, regarded, john, as, a, burning, and, shining, lamp, and, you, were, willing, to, rejoice, for, a, while, in, his, light, all, four, gospels, start, jesus, ministry, in, association, with, the, appearance, of, john, the, baptist, simon, j, joseph, has, argued, that, the, gospel, demotes, the, historical, john, by, depicting, him, only, as, a, prophetic, forerunner, to, jesus, whereas, his, ministry, actually, complemented, jesus, although, the, gospel, of, mark, implies, that, the, arrival, of, john, the, baptist, is, the, fulfilment, of, a, prophecy, from, the, book, of, isaiah, the, words, quoted, i, will, send, my, messenger, ahead, of, you, who, will, prepare, your, way, a, voice, of, one, calling, in, the, wilderness, prepare, the, way, for, the, lord, make, straight, paths, for, him, are, actually, a, composite, of, texts, from, isaiah, malachi, and, the, book, of, exodus, matthew, and, luke, drop, the, first, part, of, the, reference, the, gospels, differ, on, the, details, of, the, baptism, in, mark, and, luke, jesus, himself, sees, the, heavens, open, and, hears, a, voice, address, him, personally, saying, you, are, my, dearly, loved, son, you, bring, me, great, joy, they, do, not, clarify, whether, others, saw, and, heard, these, things, although, other, incidents, where, the, voice, came, out, of, heaven, are, recorded, in, which, for, the, sake, of, the, crowds, it, was, heard, audibly, john, did, say, in, his, witness, that, he, did, see, the, spirit, coming, down, out, of, heaven, john, 12, 28, 30, john, 1, 32, in, matthew, the, voice, from, heaven, does, not, address, jesus, personally, saying, instead, this, is, my, beloved, son, in, whom, i, am, well, pleased, in, the, gospel, of, john, john, the, baptist, himself, sees, the, spirit, descend, as, a, dove, testifying, about, the, experience, as, evidence, of, jesus, s, status, john, s, knowledge, of, jesus, varies, across, gospels, in, the, gospel, of, mark, john, preaches, of, a, coming, leader, but, shows, no, signs, of, recognizing, that, jesus, is, this, leader, in, matthew, however, john, immediately, recognizes, jesus, and, john, questions, his, own, worthiness, to, baptize, jesus, in, both, matthew, and, luke, john, later, dispatches, disciples, to, question, jesus, about, his, status, asking, are, you, he, who, is, to, come, or, shall, we, look, for, another, in, luke, john, is, a, familial, relative, of, jesus, whose, birth, was, foretold, by, gabriel, in, the, gospel, of, john, john, the, baptist, himself, sees, the, spirit, descend, like, a, dove, and, he, explicitly, preaches, that, jesus, is, the, son, of, god, the, gospels, vary, in, their, depiction, of, john, s, relationship, to, elijah, matthew, and, mark, describe, john, s, attire, in, a, way, reminiscent, of, the, description, of, elijah, in, 2, kings, 1, 8, who, also, wore, a, garment, of, hair, and, a, leather, belt, in, matthew, jesus, explicitly, teaches, that, john, is, elijah, who, was, to, come, matthew, 11, 14, see, also, matthew, 17, 11, 13, many, christian, theologians, have, taken, this, to, mean, that, john, was, elijah, s, successor, in, the, gospel, of, john, john, the, baptist, explicitly, denies, being, elijah, in, the, annunciation, narrative, in, luke, an, angel, appears, to, zechariah, john, s, father, and, tells, him, that, john, will, turn, many, of, the, sons, of, israel, to, the, lord, their, god, and, that, he, will, go, forth, in, the, spirit, and, power, of, elijah, the, following, comparison, table, is, primarily, based, on, the, new, international, version, niv, english, translation, of, the, new, testament, the, account, of, flavius, josephus, in, antiquities, of, the, jews, was, translated, by, william, whiston, john, 10, 40, 42, an, account, of, john, the, baptist, is, found, in, all, extant, manuscripts, of, the, antiquities, of, the, jews, book, 18, chapter, 5, 2, by, flavius, josephus, 37, 100, now, some, of, the, jews, thought, that, the, destruction, of, herod, s, army, came, from, god, and, that, very, justly, as, a, punishment, of, what, he, did, against, john, that, was, called, the, baptist, for, herod, slew, him, who, was, a, good, man, and, commanded, the, jews, to, exercise, virtue, both, as, to, righteousness, towards, one, another, and, piety, towards, god, and, so, to, come, to, baptism, for, that, the, washing, would, be, acceptable, to, him, if, they, made, use, of, it, not, in, order, to, the, putting, away, of, some, sins, but, for, the, purification, of, the, body, supposing, still, that, the, soul, was, thoroughly, purified, beforehand, by, righteousness, now, when, others, came, in, crowds, about, him, for, they, were, very, greatly, moved, by, hearing, his, words, herod, who, feared, lest, the, great, influence, john, had, over, the, people, might, put, it, into, his, power, and, inclination, to, raise, a, rebellion, for, they, seemed, ready, to, do, any, thing, he, should, advise, thought, it, best, by, putting, him, to, death, to, prevent, any, mischief, he, might, cause, and, not, bring, himself, into, difficulties, by, sparing, a, man, who, might, make, him, repent, of, it, when, it, would, be, too, late, accordingly, he, was, sent, a, prisoner, out, of, herod, s, suspicious, temper, to, macherus, the, castle, i, before, mentioned, and, was, there, put, to, death, now, the, jews, had, an, opinion, that, the, destruction, of, this, army, was, sent, as, a, punishment, upon, herod, and, a, mark, of, god, s, displeasure, to, him, according, to, this, passage, the, execution, of, john, was, blamed, for, the, defeat, herod, suffered, some, have, claimed, that, this, passage, indicates, that, john, died, near, the, time, of, the, destruction, of, herod, s, army, in, ad, 36, however, in, a, different, passage, josephus, states, that, the, end, of, herod, s, marriage, with, aretas, s, daughter, after, which, john, was, killed, was, only, the, beginning, of, hostilities, between, herod, and, aretas, which, later, escalated, into, the, battle, biblical, scholar, john, dominic, crossan, differentiates, between, josephus, s, account, of, john, and, jesus, saying, john, had, a, monopoly, but, jesus, had, a, franchise, to, get, baptized, crossan, writes, a, person, went, only, to, john, to, stop, the, movement, one, only, needed, to, stop, john, therefore, his, movement, ended, with, his, death, jesus, invited, all, to, come, and, see, how, he, and, his, companions, had, already, accepted, the, government, of, god, entered, it, and, were, living, it, such, a, communal, praxis, was, not, just, for, himself, but, could, survive, without, him, unlike, john, s, movement, matthew, 14, 12, records, that, his, disciples, came, and, took, away, body, and, buried, it, theologian, joseph, benson, refers, to, a, belief, that, they, managed, to, do, so, because, it, seems, that, the, body, had, been, thrown, over, the, prison, walls, without, burial, probably, by, order, of, herodias, what, became, of, the, head, of, john, the, baptist, is, difficult, to, determine, ancient, historians, josephus, nicephorus, and, symeon, metaphrastes, assumed, that, herodias, had, it, buried, in, the, fortress, of, machaerus, an, eastern, orthodox, tradition, holds, that, after, buried, the, head, was, discovered, by, john, s, followers, and, was, taken, to, the, mount, of, olives, where, it, was, twice, buried, and, discovered, the, latter, events, giving, rise, to, the, orthodox, feast, of, the, first, and, second, finding, of, the, head, of, st, john, the, baptist, other, writers, say, that, it, was, interred, in, herod, s, palace, at, jerusalem, there, it, was, found, during, the, reign, of, constantine, and, thence, secretly, taken, to, emesa, modern, homs, in, syria, where, it, was, concealed, the, place, remaining, unknown, for, years, until, it, was, manifested, by, revelation, in, 452, an, event, celebrated, in, the, orthodox, church, as, the, third, finding, an, apocryphal, tradition, claims, that, after, john, s, death, his, mother, elizabeth, was, told, by, an, angel, to, bury, him, where, his, father, lay, she, was, then, led, by, the, angel, to, the, temple, in, which, john, s, father, was, killed, by, herod, i, at, which, point, a, voice, called, out, an, earthquake, rumbled, and, thunder, struck, and, the, altar, of, the, temple, opened, revealing, zechariah, s, body, elizabeth, then, buried, john, s, body, under, this, altar, two, catholic, churches, and, one, mosque, claim, to, have, the, head, of, john, the, baptist, the, umayyad, mosque, in, damascus, syria, the, church, of, san, silvestro, in, capite, in, rome, and, amiens, cathedral, in, france, the, french, king, would, have, had, it, brought, from, the, holy, land, after, the, fourth, crusade, a, fourth, claim, is, made, by, the, residenz, museum, in, munich, germany, which, keeps, a, reliquary, containing, what, the, wittelsbach, rulers, of, bavaria, believed, to, be, the, head, of, saint, john, according, to, the, christian, arab, ibn, butlan, the, church, of, cassian, in, antioch, held, the, right, arm, of, john, the, baptist, until, it, was, smuggled, to, chalcedon, and, later, to, constantinople, an, orthodox, christian, monastery, in, cetinje, montenegro, and, the, catholic, cathedral, of, siena, in, italy, both, claim, to, have, john, the, baptist, s, right, arm, and, hand, with, which, he, baptised, jesus, according, to, the, catholic, account, in, 1464, pope, pius, ii, donated, what, was, identified, as, the, right, arm, and, hand, of, john, the, baptist, to, the, siena, cathedral, the, donation, charter, identifies, the, relic, as, the, arm, of, blessed, john, the, baptist, and,

centuries, on, the, black, sea, island, of, sveti, ivan, saint, john, and, two, years, later, after, dna, and, radio, carbon, testing, proved, the, bones, belonged, to, a, middle, eastern, man, who, lived, in, the, 1st, century, ad, scientists, said, that, the, remains, could, conceivably, have, belonged, to, john, the, baptist, the, remains, found, in, a, reliquarium, are, presently, kept, in,

appears, on, the, official, coat, of, arms, one, legend, among, others, bases, the, etymology, of, the, town, s, place, name, on, halig, holy, and, fax, hair, claiming, that, a, relic, of, the, head, or, face, of, john, the, baptist, once, existed, in, the, town, the, gospels, describe, john, the, baptist, as, having, had, a, specific, role, ordained, by, god, as, forerunner, or, precursor, of, jesus, who, was, the, foretold, messiah, the, new, testament, gospels, speak, of, this, role, in, luke, 1, 17, the, role, of, john, is, referred, to, as, being, to, turn, the, hearts, of, the, fathers, to, the, children, and, the, disobedient, to, the, wisdom, of, the, just, to, make, ready, a, people, prepared, for, the, lord, in, luke, 1, 76, as, thou, shalt, go, before, the, face, of, the, lord, to, prepare, his, ways, and, in, luke, 1, 77, as, being, to, give, knowledge, of, salvation, unto, his, people, by, the, remission, of, their, sins, there, are, several, passages, within, the, old, testament, which, are, interpreted, by, christians, as, being, prophetic, of, john, the, baptist, in, this, role, these, include, a, passage, in, the, book, of, malachi, that, refers, to, a, prophet, who, would, prepare, the, way, of, the, lord, behold, i, will, send, my, messenger, and, he, shall, prepare, the, way, before, me, and, the, lord, whom, ye, seek, shall, suddenly, come, to, his, temple, even, the, messenger, of, the, covenant, whom, ye, delight, in, behold, he, shall, come, saith, the, l, ord, of, hosts, also, at, the, end, of, the, next, chapter, in, malachi, 4, 5, 6, it, says, behold, i, will, send, you, elijah, the, prophet, before, the, coming, of, the, great, and, dreadful, day, of, the, l, ord, and, he, shall, turn, the, heart, of, the, fathers, to, the, children, and, the, heart, of, the, children, to, their, fathers, lest, i, come, and, smite, the, earth, with, a, curse, the, jews, of, jesus, day, expected, elijah, to, come, before, the, messiah, indeed, some, present, day, jews, continue, to, await, elijah, s, coming, as, well, as, in, the, cup, of, elijah, the, prophet, in, the, passover, seder, this, is, why, the, disciples, ask, jesus, in, matthew, 17, 10, why, then, say, the, scribes, that, elias, must, first, come, the, disciples, are, then, told, by, jesus, that, elijah, came, in, the, person, of, john, the, baptist, jesus, replied, to, be, sure, elijah, comes, and, will, restore, all, things, but, i, tell, you, elijah, has, already, come, and, they, did, not, recognize, him, but, have, done, to, him, everything, they, wished, in, the, same, way, the, son, of, man, is, going, to, suffer, at, their, hands, then, the, disciples, understood, that, he, was, talking, to, them, about, john, the, baptist, these, passages, are, applied, to, john, in, the, synoptic, gospels, but, where, matthew, specifically, identifies, john, the, baptist, as, elijah, s, spiritual, successor, the, gospels, of, mark, and, luke, are, silent, on, the, matter, the, gospel, of, john, states, that, john, the, baptist, denied, that, he, was, elijah, now, this, was, john, s, testimony, when, the, jews, of, jerusalem, sent, priests, and, levites, to, ask, him, who, he, was, he, did, not, deny, but, confessed, freely, i, am, not, the, christ, they, asked, him, then, who, are, you, are, you, elijah, he, said, i, am, not, are, you, the, prophet, he, answered, no, many, scholars, believe, there, was, contact, between, the, early, church, in, the, apostolic, age, and, what, is, called, the, qumran, essene, community, the, dead, sea, scrolls, were, found, at, qumran, which, the, majority, of, historians, and, archaeologists, identify, as, an, essene, settlement, john, the, baptist, is, thought, to, have, been, either, an, essene, or, associated, with, the, community, at, khirbet, qumran, according, to, the, book, of, acts, paul, met, some, disciples, of, john, in, ephesus, the, catholic, church, commemorates, saint, john, the, baptist, on, two, feast, days, according, to, frederick, holweck, at, the, visitation, of, the, blessed, virgin, mary, to, his, mother, elizabeth, as, recounted, in, luke, 1, 39, 57, john, sensing, the, presence, of, his, jesus, upon, the, arrival, of, mary, leaped, in, the, womb, of, his, mother, he, was, then, cleansed, from, original, sin, and, filled, with, the, grace, of, god, in, her, treatise, of, prayer, saint, catherine, of, siena, includes, a, brief, altercation, with, the, devil, regarding, her, fight, due, to, the, devil, attempting, to, lure, her, with, vanity, and, flattery, speaking, in, the, first, person, catherine, responds, to, the, devil, with, the, following, words, humiliation, of, yourself, and, you, answered, the, devil, with, these, words, wretch, that, i, am, john, the, baptist, never, sinned, and, was, sanctified, in, his, mother, s, womb, and, i, have, committed, so, many, sins, the, eastern, catholic, churches, and, eastern, orthodox, faith, believe, that, john, was, the, last, of, the, old, testament, prophets, thus, serving, as, a, bridge, between, that, period, of, revelation, and, the, new, covenant, they, also, teach, that, following, his, death, john, descended, into, hades, and, there, once, more, preached, that, jesus, the, messiah, was, coming, so, he, was, the, forerunner, of, christ, in, death, as, he, had, been, in, life, eastern, catholic, and, orthodox, churches, will, often, have, an, icon, of, saint, john, the, baptist, in, a, place, of, honor, on, the, iconostasis, and, he, is, frequently, mentioned, during, the, divine, services, every, tuesday, throughout, the, year, is, dedicated, to, his, memory, the, eastern, orthodox, church, remembers, saint, john, the, forerunner, on, six, separate, feast, days, listed, here, in, order, in, which, they, occur, during, the, church, year, which, begins, on, 1, september, in, addition, to, the, above, 5, september, is, the, commemoration, of, zacharias, and, elizabeth, saint, john, s, parents, the, russian, orthodox, church, observes, 12, october, as, the, transfer, of, the, right, hand, of, the, forerunner, from, malta, to, gatchina, 1799, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, that, modern, revelation, confirms, the, biblical, account, of, john, and, also, makes, known, additional, events, in, his, ministry, according, to, this, belief, john, was, ordained, by, the, angel, of, god, when, he, was, eight, days, old, to, overthrow, the, kingdom, of, the, jews, and, to, prepare, a, people, for, the, lord, latter, day, saints, also, believe, that, he, was, baptized, while, yet, in, his, childhood, joseph, smith, said, let, us, come, into, new, testament, times, so, many, are, ever, praising, the, lord, and, his, apostles, we, will, commence, with, john, the, baptist, when, herod, s, edict, went, forth, to, destroy, the, young, children, john, was, about, six, months, older, than, jesus, and, came, under, this, hellish, edict, and, zecharias, caused, his, mother, to, take, him, into, the, mountains, where, he, was, raised, on, locusts, and, wild, honey, when, his, father, refused, to, disclose, his, hiding, place, and, being, the, officiating, high, priest, at, the, temple, that, year, was, slain, by, herod, s, order, between, the, porch, and, the, altar, as, jesus, said, the, church, of, jesus, christ, of, latter, day, saints, teaches, that, john, the, baptist, appeared, on, the, banks, of, the, susquehanna, river, near, harmony, township, susquehanna, county, pennsylvania, as, a, resurrected, being, to, joseph, smith, and, oliver, cowdery, on, 15, may, 1829, and, ordained, them, to, the, aaronic, priesthood, according, to, the, church, s, dispensational, view, of, religious, history, john, s, ministry, has, operated, in, three, dispensations, he, was, the, last, of, the, prophets, under, the, law, of, moses, he, was, the, first, of, the, new, testament, prophets, and, he, was, sent, to, restore, the, aaronic, priesthood, in, our, day, the, dispensation, of, the, fulness, of, times, latter, day, saints, believe, john, s, ministry, was, foretold, by, two, prophets, whose, teachings, are, included, in, the, book, of, mormon, lehi, and, his, son, nephi, the, unification, church, teaches, that, god, intended, john, to, help, jesus, during, his, public, ministry, in, judea, in, particular, john, should, have, done, everything, in, his, power, to, persuade, the, jewish, people, that, jesus, was, the, messiah, he, was, to, become, jesus, main, disciple, and, john, s, disciples, were, to, become, jesus, disciples, unfortunately, john, did, not, follow, jesus, and, continued, his, own, way, of, baptizing, people, moreover, john, also, denied, that, he, was, elijah, when, queried, by, several, jewish, leaders, contradicting, jesus, who, stated, john, is, elijah, who, was, to, come, many, jews, therefore, could, not, accept, jesus, as, the, messiah, because, john, denied, being, elijah, as, the, prophet, s, appearance, was, a, prerequisite, for, the, messiah, s, arrival, as, stated, in, malachi, 4, 5, according, to, the, unification, church, john, the, baptist, was, in, the, position, of, representing, elijah, s, physical, body, making, himself, identical, with, elijah, from, the, standpoint, of, their, mission, according, to, matthew, 11, 11, jesus, stated, there, has, not, risen, one, greater, than, john, the, baptist, however, in, referring, to, john, s, blocking, the, way, of, the, jews, understanding, of, him, as, the, messiah, jesus, said, yet, he, who, is, least, in, the, kingdom, of, heaven, is, greater, than, he, john, s, failure, to, follow, jesus, became, the, chief, obstacle, to, the, fulfillment, of, jesus, mission, among, the, early, judeo, christian, gnostics, the, ebionites, held, that, john, along, with, jesus, and, james, the, just, all, of, whom, they, revered, were, vegetarians, epiphanius, of, salamis, records, that, this, group, had, amended, their, gospel, of, matthew, known, today, as, the, gospel, of, the, ebionites, to, change, where, john, eats, locusts, to, read, honey, cakes, or, manna, john, the, baptist, or, yuhana, ma, bana, classical, mandaic, lit, john, the, baptizer, iuhana, ma, bana, is, considered, the, greatest, prophet, of, the, mandaeans, mandaeans, also, refer, to, him, as, yuhana, bar, zakria, john, son, of, zechariah, he, plays, a, large, part, in, their, religious, texts, such, as, the, ginza, rabba, and, the, mandaean, book, of, john, mandaeans, believe, that, they, descend, directly, from, john, s, original, disciples, but, they, do, not, believe, that, their, religion, began, with, john, tracing, their, beliefs, back, to, their, first, prophet, adam, 3, according, to, mandaeism, john, was, a, great, teacher, a, nasoraean, and, renewer, of, the, faith, 24, john, is, a, messenger, of, light, nhura, and, truth, kushta, who, possessed, the, power, of, healing, and, full, gnosis, manda, 48, mandaean, texts, make, it, abundantly, clear, that, early, mandaeans, were, extremely, loyal, to, john, and, viewed, him, as, a, prophetic, reformer, of, the, ancient, mandaean, israelite, tradition, 108, scholars, such, as, mark, lidzbarski, rudolf, mac, ch, ethel, s, drower, jorunn, j, buckley, and, inasi, g, nd, z, believe, that, the, mandaeans, likely, have, a, historical, connection, with, john, s, original, disciples, mandaeans, believe, that, john, was, married, with, his, wife, named, anhar, and, had, children, eni, bai, elizabeth, is, mentioned, as, the, mother, of, john, the, baptist, in, chapters, 18, 21, and, 32, of, the, mandaean, book, of, john, john, the, baptist, is, known, as, ya, y, ibn, zakariy, arabic, in, islam, and, is, honoured, as, a, prophet, he, is, believed, by, muslims, to, have, been, a, witness, to, the, word, of, god, and, a, prophet, who, would, herald, the, coming, of, jesus, his, father, zechariah, was, also, an, islamic, prophet, islamic, tradition, maintains, that, john, met, muhammad, on, the, night, of, the, mi, raj, along, with, jesus, in, the, second, heaven, john, s, story, was, also, told, to, the, abyssinian, king, during, the, muslim, refugees, migration, to, abyssinia, according, to, the, quran, john, was, one, on, whom, god, sent, peace, on, the, day, that, he, was, born, and, the, day, that, he, died, the, quran, claims, that, john, the, baptist, was, the, first, to, receive, this, name, quran, 19, 7, 10, but, since, the, name, yo, anan, occurs, many, times, before, john, the, baptist, this, verse, is, referring, either, to, islamic, scholar, consensus, that, ya, y, is, not, the, same, name, as, yo, anan, or, to, the, biblical, account, of, the, miraculous, naming, of, john, which, accounted, that, he, was, almost, named, zacharias, greek, after, his, father, s, name, as, no, one, in, the, lineage, of, his, father, zacharias, also, known, as, zechariah, had, been, named, john, yohanan, yoannes, before, him, in, the, quran, god, frequently, mentions, zechariah, s, continuous, praying, for, the, birth, of, a, son, zechariah, s, wife, mentioned, in, the, new, testament, as, elizabeth, was, barren, and, therefore, the, birth, of, a, child, seemed, impossible, as, a, gift, from, god, zechariah, or, zakariya, was, given, a, son, by, the, name, of, ya, ya, or, john, a, name, specially, chosen, for, this, child, alone, in, accordance, with, zechariah, s, prayer, god, made, john, and, jesus, who, according, to, exegesis, was, born, six, months, later, renew, the, message, of, god, which, had, been, corrupted, and, lost, by, the, israelites, as, the, quran, says, the, angels, announced, o, zachariah, indeed, we, give, you, the, good, news, of, the, birth, of, a, son, whose, name, will, be, john, a, name, we, have, not, given, to, anyone, before, he, wondered, my, lord, how, can, i, have, a, son, when, my, wife, is, barren, and, i, have, become, extremely, old, an, angel, replied, so, will, it, be, your, lord, says, it, is, easy, for, me, just, as, i, created, you, before, when, you, were, nothing, zachariah, said, my, lord, grant, me, a, sign, he, responded, your, sign, is, that, you, will, not, be, able, to, speak, to, people, for, three, nights, despite, being, healthy, john, was, exhorted, to, hold, fast, to, the, scripture, and, was, given, wisdom, by, god, while, still, a, child, he, was, pure, and, devout, and, walked, well, in, the, presence, of, god, he, was, dutiful, towards, his, parents, and, he, was, not, arrogant, or, rebellious, john, s, reading, and, understanding, of, the, scriptures, when, only, a, child, surpassed, even, that, of, the, greatest, scholars, of, the, time, muslim, exegesis, narrates, that, jesus, sent, john, out, with, twelve, disciples, who, preached, the, message, before, jesus, called, his, own, disciples, the, quran, says, it, was, later, said, o, john, hold, firmly, to, the, scriptures, and, we, granted, him, wisdom, while, he, was, still, a, child, john, was, a, classical, prophet, who, was, exalted, high, by, god, for, his, bold, denouncing, of, all, things, sinful, furthermore, the, quran, speaks, of, john, s, gentle, piety, and, love, and, his, humble, attitude, towards, life, for, which, he, was, granted, the, purity, of, life, as, well, as, purity, and, compassion, from, us, and, he, was, god, fearing, and, kind, to, his, parents, he, was, neither, arrogant, nor, disobedient, peace, be, upon, him, the, day, he, was, born, and, the, day, of, his, death, and, the, day, he, will, be, raised, back, to, life, john, is, also, honored, highly, in, sufism, as, well, as, islamic, mysticism, primarily, because, of, the, quran, s, description, of, john, s, chastity, and, kindness, sufis, have, frequently, applied, commentaries, on, the, passages, on, john, in, the, quran, primarily, concerning, the, god, given, gift, of, wisdom, which, he, acquired, in, youth, as, well, as, his, parallels, with, jesus, although, several, phrases, used, to, describe, john, and, jesus, are, virtually, identical, in, the, quran, the, manner, in, which, they, are, expressed, is, different, druze, tradition, honors, several, mentors, and, prophets, and, john, the, baptist, is, honored, as, a, prophet, druze, venerate, john, the, baptist, and, he, is, considered, a, central, figure, in, druzism, druze, like, some, christians, believe, that, elijah, al, khidr, came, back, as, john, the, baptist, since, they, believe, in, reincarnation, and, the, transmigration, of, the, soul, the, bah, faith, considers, john, to, have, been, a, prophet, of, god, who, like, all, other, prophets, was, sent, to, instill, the, knowledge, of, god, promote, unity, among, the, people, of, the, world, and, to, show, people, the, correct, way, to, live, there, are, numerous, quotations, in, the, writings, of, bah, u, ll, h, founder, of, the, bah, faith, mentioning, john, the, baptist, he, is, regarded, by, bah, s, as, a, lesser, prophet, bah, u, ll, h, claimed, that, his, forerunner, the, b, b, was, the, spiritual, return, of, john, the, baptist, in, his, letter, to, pope, pius, ix, bah, u, ll, h, wrote, o, followers, of, the, son, we, have, once, again, sent, john, unto, you, and, he, verily, hath, cried, out, in, the, wilderness, of, the, bay, n, o, peoples, of, the, world, cleanse, your, eyes, the, day, whereon, ye, can, behold, the, promised, one, and, attain, unto, him, hath, drawn, nigh, o, followers, of, the, gospel, prepare, the, way, the, day, of, the, advent, of, the, glorious, lord, is, at, hand, make, ready, to, enter, the, kingdom, thus, hath, it, been, ordained, by, god, he, who, causeth, the, dawn, to, break, john, is, believed, to, have, had, the, specific, role, of, foretelling, and, preparing, the, way, for, jesus, in, condemning, those, who, had, turned, aside, from, him, bah, u, ll, h, compared, them, to, the, followers, of, john, the, baptist, who, he, said, protested, against, him, who, was, the, spirit, jesus, saying, the, dispensation, of, john, hath, not, yet, ended, wherefore, hast, thou, come, bah, u, ll, h, believed, that, the, b, b, played, the, same, role, as, john, in, preparing, the, people, for, his, own, coming, as, such, bah, u, ll, h, refers, to, the, b, b, as, my, forerunner, the, forerunner, being, a, title, that, christians, reserve, for, john, the, baptist, however, bah, s, consider, the, b, b, to, be, a, greater, prophet, manifestation, of, god, and, thus, possessed, of, a, far, greater, station, than, john, the, baptist, scholars, studying, john, the, baptist, s, relationship, with, jesus, of, nazareth, have, commented, on, the, differences, in, their, respective, approaches, james, f, mcgrath, writes, in, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, the, mandaeans, received, significant, attention, from, new, testament, scholars, who, thought, that, their, high, view, of, john, the, baptist, might, mean, they, were, the, descendants, of, his, disciples, many, historians, think, that, jesus, of, nazareth, was, a, disciple, of, john, the, baptist, before, breaking, away, to, form, his, own, movement, and, i, am, inclined, to, agree, l, michael, white, says, john, the, baptist, should, be, thought, of, primarily, as, one, who, was, calling, for, a, return, to, an, intensely, jewish, piety, to, follow, the, way, of, the, lord, to, make, oneself, pure, to, be, right, with, god, and, it, seems, to, be, that, he, calls, for, baptism, as, a, sign, of, rededication, or, repurification, of, life, in, a, typically, jewish, way, before, god, john, dominic, crossan, sees, john, the, baptist, as, an, apocalyptic, eschatologist, whose, message, was, that, god, very, soon, imminently, any, moment, is, going, to, descend, to, eradicate, the, evil, of, this, world, in, a, sort, of, an, apocalyptic, consummation, when, jesus, says, john, is, the, greatest, person, ever, born, on, earth, but, the, least, in, the, kingdom, of, god, is, greater, than, john, it, means, jesus, is, changing, his, vision, of, god, and, the, kingdom, of, god, from, what, he, has, taken, from, john, for, crossan, jesus, is, an, ethical, eschatologist, that, sees, the, demand, that, god, is, making, on, us, not, us, on, god, so, much, as, god, on, us, to, do, something, about, the, evil, in, the, world, michael, h, crosby, o, f, m, cap, states, there, was, no, biblical, evidence, indicating, that, john, the, baptist, ever, became, a, disciple, of, jesus, he, believes, that, john, s, concept, of, what, a, messiah, should, be, was, in, contrast, to, how, jesus, presented, himself, and, kept, him, from, becoming, a, disciple, of, jesus, crosby, states, an, unbiased, reading, leaves, us, with, the, figure, of, john, the, baptist, as, a, reformist, jew, who, also, may, have, wanted, desperately, to, become, a, believer, but, was, unable, to, become, convinced, of, jesus, messiahship, crosby, considers, john, s, effectiveness, as, a, precursor, in, encouraging, others, to, follow, jesus, as, very, minimal, since, the, scriptures, record, only, two, of, his, own, followers, having, become, jesus, disciples, professor, candida, moss, noted, that, john, and, jesus, become, de, facto, competitors, in, the, ancient, religious, marketplace, even, after, baptizing, jesus, john, did, not, follow, jesus, but, maintained, a, separate, ministry, after, john, s, death, jesus, followers, had, to, differentiate, him, from, the, executed, prophet, countering, the, prevalent, idea, that, jesus, was, actually, john, raised, from, the, dead, moss, also, references, the, incident, in, matthew, 16, where, disciples, indicated, some, people, believed, jesus, was, john, the, baptist, pastor, robert, l, deffinbaugh, views, john, s, sending, two, of, his, disciples, to, ask, jesus, if, he, were, the, messiah, or, whether, another, should, be, sought, as, the, baptist, s, issuing, a, public, challenge, since, the, message, was, presented, to, jesus, while, he, was, with, a, gathered, crowd, deffinbaugh, suggests, that, john, might, have, been, looking, for, inauguration, of, the, kingdom, of, god, in, a, more, dramatic, way, than, what, jesus, was, presenting, as, john, had, previously, warned, that, the, messiah, would, come, with, fire, jesus, answered, by, indicating, his, miracle, works, and, teachings, which, themselves, gave, evidence, of, his, identity, the, blind, receive, sight, the, lame, walk, those, who, have, leprosy, are, cured, the, deaf, hear, the, dead, are, raised, and, the, good, news, is, preached, to, the, poor, harold, w, attridge, agrees, with, crossan, that, john, was, an, apocalyptic, preacher, attridge, says, most, contemporary, scholars, would, see, the, idea, of, john, as, the, forerunner, of, jesus, as, a, construct, developed, by, the, early, church, to, help, explain, the, relationship, between, the, two, for, the, early, church, it, would, have, been, something, of, an, embarrassment, to, say, that, jesus, who, was, in, their, minds, superior, to, john, the, baptist, had, been, baptized, by, him, and, thereby, proclaimed, some, sort, of, subordination, to, him, some, sort, of, disciple, relationship, to, him, barbara, thiering, questions, the, dating, of, the, dead, sea, scrolls, and, suggests, that, the, teacher, of, righteousness, leader, of, the, essenes, preached, coming, fiery, judgment, said, the, axe, is, laid, to, the, roots, of, the, tree, called, people, vipers, practiced, baptism, and, lived, in, the, wilderness, of, judea, due, to, these, reasons, she, believes, there, is, a, strong, possibility, that, the, teacher, of, righteousness, was, john, the, baptist, the, earliest, depictions, of, st, john, are, found, in, the, baptism, of, christ, one, of, the, earliest, scenes, from, the, life, of, christ, to, be, frequently, depicted, in, early, christian, art, and, john, s, tall, thin, even, gaunt, and, bearded, figure, is, already, established, by, the, 5th, century, only, he, and, jesus, are, consistently, shown, with, long, hair, from, early, christian, times, when, the, apostles, generally, have, trim, classical, cuts, in, fact, john, is, more, consistently, depicted, in, this, way, than, jesus, in, byzantine, and, later, eastern, orthodox, art, john, the, baptist, and, the, holy, virgin, mary, often, flank, jesus, on, either, side, the, composition, of, the, deesis, came, to, be, included, in, every, eastern, orthodox, church, as, remains, the, case, to, this, day, here, john, and, the, theotokos, mary, the, god, bearer, flank, a, christ, pantocrator, and, intercede, for, humanity, in, orthodox, icons, he, often, has, angel, s, wings, since, mark, 1, 2, describes,
