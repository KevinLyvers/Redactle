the, town, council, of, veracruz, prevented, him, from, moving, to, mexico, city, to, advance, his, career, since, the, late, 18th, century, bourbon, reforms, the, spanish, crown, had, favored, peninsular, born, spaniards, over, american, born, young, santa, anna, s, family, was, affected, by, the, growing, disgruntlement, of, creoles, whose, upward, mobility, was, thwarted, santa, anna, s, mother, favored, her, son, s, choice, of, a, military, career, supporting, his, desire, to, join, the, spanish, army, rather, than, be, a, shopkeeper, as, his, father, preferred, his, mother, s,

s, eastern, coast, had, important, ramifications, for, his, military, career, as, he, had, developed, immunity, from, yellow, fever, endemic, to, the, region, the, port, of, veracruz, and, environs, were, known, to, be, unhealthy, for, those, not, native, to, the, region, so, he, had, a, personal, strategic, advantage, against, military, officers, from, elsewhere, being, an, officer, in, a, time, of, war, was, a, way, that, a, provincial, middle, class, man, could, vault, from, obscurity, to, a, position, of, leadership, santa, anna, distinguished, himself, in, battle, a, path, that, led, him, to, a, national, political, career, santa, anna, s, provincial, origins, made, him, uncomfortable, in, the, halls, of, power, in, mexico, city, which, were, dominated, by, cliques, of, elite, men, and, thus, he, frequently, made, retreats, to, his, base, in, veracruz, he, cultivated, contact, with, ordinary, mexican, men, and, pursued, entertainments, such, as, cockfighting, over, his, career, santa, anna, was, a, populist, caudillo, a, strongman, wielding, both, military, and, political, power, similar, to, others, who, emerged, in, the, wake, of, spanish, american, wars, of, independence, santa, anna, s, early, military, career, during, the, mexican, war, of, independence, which, entailed, fighting, the, insurgency, before, switching, sides, against, the, crown, presaged, his, many, shifts, in, allegiance, during, his, later, political, career, in, june, 1810, the, 16, year, old, santa, anna, joined, the, fijo, de, veracruz, infantry, regiment, in, september, of, that, year, secular, cleric, miguel, hidalgo, y, costilla, sparked, a, spontaneous, mass, uprising, in, the, baj, o, mexico, s, rich, agricultural, area, although, some, creole, elites, had, chafed, as, their, upward, mobility, had, been, thwarted, by, the, bourbon, reforms, the, hidalgo, revolt, saw, most, creoles, favoring, continued, crown, rule, in, particular, santa, anna, s, family, saw, themselves, as, aligned, to, the, peninsular, elite, whom, they, served, and, were, in, turn, recognized, as, belonging, initially, santa, anna, like, most, creole, military, officers, fought, for, the, crown, against, the, mixed, raced, insurgents, for, independence, his, commanding, officer, was, colonel, jos, joaqu, n, de, arredondo, in, 1811, he, was, wounded, in, the, left, hand, by, an, arrow, while,

the, battle, of, medina, in, which, he, was, cited, for, bravery, santa, anna, was, promoted, quickly, he, became, a, second, lieutenant, in, february, 1812, and, first, lieutenant, before, the, end, of, that, year, during, the, initial, rebellion, the, young, officer, witnessed, arredondo, s, fierce, counterinsurgency, policy, of, mass, executions, the, early, fighting, against, the, rebels, gave, way, to, guerrilla, warfare, and, a, military, stalemate, when, royalist, officer, agust, n, de, iturbide, switched, sides, in, 1821, and, allied, with, insurgent, vicente, guerrero, fighting, for, independence, under, the, plan, of, iguala, santa, anna, also, joined, the, fight, for, independence, political, developments, in, spain, where, liberals, had, ousted, king, ferdinand, vii, and, began, implementing, the, spanish, liberal, constitution, of, 1812, made, many, elites, in, mexico, reconsider, their, options, iturbide, now, emperor, augustin, i, rewarded, santa, anna, with, the, command, of, the, vital, port, of, veracruz, the, gateway, from, the, gulf, of, mexico, to, the, rest, of, the, nation, and, site, of, a, customs, house, however, iturbide, subsequently, removed, santa, anna, from, the, post, prompting, santa, anna, to, rise, in, rebellion, in, december, 1822, against, iturbide, he, already, had, significant, power, in, his, home, region, of, veracruz, and, he, was, well, along, the, path, to, becoming, the, regional, caudillo, santa, anna, claimed, in, his, plan, of, veracruz, that, he, rebelled, because, iturbide, had, dissolved, the, constituent, congress, he, also, promised, to, support, free, trade, with, spain, an, important, principle, for, his, home, region, of, veracruz, although, santa, anna, s, initial, rebellion, was, important, iturbide, had, loyal, military, men, who, were, able, to, hold, their, own, against, the, rebels, in, veracruz, however, former, insurgent, leaders, guerrero, and, nicol, s, bravo, who, had, supported, iturbide, s, plan, de, iguala, returned, to, their, base, in, southern, mexico, and, raised, a, rebellion, against, iturbide, the, commander, of, imperial, forces, in, veracruz, who, had, fought, against, the, rebels, changed, sides, and, joined, the, rebels, the, new, coalition, proclaimed, the, plan, of, casa, mata, which, called, for, the, end, of, the, monarchy, restoration, of, the, constituent, congress, and, creation, of, a, republic, and, a, federal, system, no, longer, the, main, player, in, the, movement, against, iturbide, or, the, creation, of, new, political, arrangements, santa, anna, sought, to, regain, his, position, as, a, leader, and, marched, forces, to, tampico, then, to, san, luis, potos, proclaiming, his, role, as, the, protector, of, the, federation, representatives, from, san, luis, potos, and, other, north, central, regions, such, as, michoac, n, quer, taro, and, guanajuato, met, to, decide, their, own, position, towards, the, federation, santa, anna, pledged, his, military, forces, to, the, protection, of, these, key, areas, he, attempted, in, other, words, to, co, opt, the, movement, the, first, of, many, examples, in, his, long, career, where, he, placed, himself, as, the, head, of, a, generalized, movement, so, it, would, become, an, instrument, of, his, advancement, in, may, 1823, following, iturbide, s, abdication, as, emperor, in, march, santa, anna, was, sent, to, command, in, yucat, n, at, the, time, yucat, n, s, capital, of, m, rida, and, the, port, city, of, campeche, were, in, conflict, yucat, n, s, closest, trade, partner, was, cuba, a, spanish, colony, santa, anna, took, it, upon, himself, to, plan, a, landing, force, from, yucat, n, in, cuba, which, he, envisioned, would, result, in, cuban, colonists, welcoming, their, liberators, most, especially, himself, one, thousand, mexicans, were, already, on, ships, to, sail, to, cuba, when, word, came, that, the, spanish, were, reinforcing, their, colony, so, the, invasion, was, called, off, former, insurgent, general, guadalupe, victoria, a, liberal, federalist, became, the, first, president, of, the, mexican, republic, in, 1824, following, the, creation, of, the, constitution, of, 1824, victoria, came, to, the, presidency, with, little, factional, conflict, and, served, out, his, entire, four, year, term, however, the, election, of, 1828, was, quite, different, with, considerable, political, conflict, in, which, santa, anna, became, involved, even, before, the, election, there, was, unrest, in, mexico, with, some, conservatives, affiliated, with, the, scottish, rite, freemasons, plotting, rebellion, the, so, called, monta, o, rebellion, in, december, 1827, called, for, the, prohibition, of, secret, societies, implicitly, meaning, liberal, york, rite, freemasons, and, the, expulsion, of, u, s, diplomat, joel, roberts, poinsett, a, promoter, of, federal, republicanism, although, santa, anna, was, believed, to, be, a, supporter, of, the, scottish, rite, conservatives, and, santa, anna, was, himself, a, member, of, the, scottish, rite, in, the, monta, o, rebellion, he, eventually, threw, his, support, to, the, liberals, in, his, home, state, of, veracruz, the, governor, had, thrown, his, support, to, the, rebels, and, in, the, aftermath, of, the, rebellion, s, failure, santa, anna, as, vice, governor, stepped, into, the, governorship, in, the, 1828, election, santa, anna, supported, guerrero, who, was, a, candidate, for, the, presidency, another, important, liberal, lorenzo, de, zavala, also, supported, guerrero, however, conservative, manuel, g, mez, pedraza, won, the, indirect, elections, for, the, presidency, with, guerrero, coming, in, second, even, before, all, the, votes, had, been, counted, santa, anna, raised, a, rebellion, and, called, for, the, nullification, of, the, election, results, as, well, for, a, new, law, expelling, spanish, nationals, who, he, believed, to, have, been, in, league, with, the, conservatives, the, rebellion, initially, had, few, supporters, although, southern, mexican, leader, juan, lvarez, soon, santa, anna, while, zavala, under, threat, of, arrest, by, the, conservative, senate, fled, to, the, mountains, and, organized, his, own, rebellion, zavala, brought, the, fighting, into, mexico, city, with, his, supporters, seizing, an, armory, the, acordada, president, elect, g, mez, pedraza, resigned, and, soon, after, went, into, exile, clearing, the, way, for, guerrero, to, assume, office, santa, anna, gained, prominence, for, his, role, in, g, mez, pedraza, s, ouster, and, was, lauded, as, a, defender, of, federalism, and, democracy, in, 1829, spain, made, a, final, attempt, to, retake, mexico, invading, tampico, with, a, force, of, 2, 600, troops, santa, anna, marched, against, the, barradas, expedition, with, a, much, smaller, force, and, defeated, the, spaniards, many, of, whom, were, suffering, from, yellow, fever, the, defeat, of, the, spanish, army, not, only, firmly, established, santa, anna, as, a, national, hero, but, also, consolidated, the, independence, of, the, new, mexican, republic, from, this, point, forward, santa, anna, styled, himself, the, victor, of, tampico, and, the, savior, of, the, patria, his, main, act, of, self, promotion, was, to, call, himself, the, napoleon, of, the, west, three, months, later, in, december, 1829, vice, president, anastasio, bustamante, a, conservative, mounted, a, successful, coup, d, etat, against, president, guerrero, who, left, mexico, city, to, lead, a, counter, rebellion, in, the, south, guerrero, was, captured, and, executed, after, a, summary, trial, in, 1831, which, shocked, the, nation, in, 1832, santa, anna, seized, the, customs, revenues, from, veracruz, and, declared, himself, in, rebellion, against, bustamante, the, bloody, conflict, ended, with, santa, anna, forcing, the, resignation, of, bustamante, s, cabinet, and, an, agreement, was, brokered, for, new, elections, in, 1833, santa, anna, was, elected, president, on, 1, april, 1833, but, while, he, desired, the, title, he, was, not, interested, in, governing, according, to, mexican, historian, enrique, krauze, it, annoyed, him, and, bored, him, and, perhaps, frightened, him, a, biographer, of, santa, anna, describes, his, role, during, this, period, as, the, absentee, president, vice, president, valent, n, g, mez, far, as, took, over, the, responsibility, of, governing, the, nation, while, santa, anna, retired, to, manga, de, clavo, his, hacienda, in, veracruz, g, mez, far, as, was, a, moderate, but, he, had, a, radical, liberal, congress, with, which, to, contend, perhaps, a, reason, that, santa, anna, left, executive, power, to, him, mexico, was, faced, with, an, empty, treasury, and, an, 11, million, peso, debt, incurred, by, the, bustamante, government, g, mez, far, as, could, not, cut, back, on, the, bloated, expenditures, on, the, army, and, sought, other, revenues, taking, a, chapter, out, of, the, late, bourbon, reforms, he, targeted, the, roman, catholic, church, anticlericalism, was, a, tenet, of, mexican, liberalism, and, the, church, had, supported, bustamante, s, government, so, targeting, that, institution, was, a, logical, move, tithing, a, 10, tax, on, agricultural, production, was, abolished, as, a, legal, obligation, and, church, property, and, finances, were, seized, the, church, s, role, in, education, was, reduced, and, the, royal, and, pontifical, university, of, mexico, closed, all, this, caused, concern, among, mexican, conservatives, g, mez, far, as, sought, to, extend, these, reforms, to, the, frontier, province, of, alta, california, promoting, legislation, to, secularize, the, franciscan, missions, there, in, 1833, he, organized, the, h, jar, padr, s, colony, to, bolster, non, mission, civilian, settlement, as, well, as, defend, the, province, against, perceived, russian, colonial, ambitions, from, the, trading, post, at, fort, ross, however, for, liberal, intellectual, and, catholic, priest, jos, mar, a, luis, mora, selling, church, property, was, the, key, to, transforming, mexico, into, a, liberal, progressive, nation, of, small, landowners, sale, of, nonessential, church, property, would, bring, in, much, needed, revenue, to, the, treasury, the, army, was, also, targeted, for, reform, since, it, was, the, largest, single, expenditure, in, the, national, budget, on, santa, anna, s, suggestion, the, number, of, battalions, was, to, be, reduced, as, well, as, the, number, of, generals, and, brigadiers, the, government, soon, issued, a, law, the, ley, del, caso, which, called, for, the, arrest, of, 51, politicians, including, bustamante, for, holding, unpatriotic, beliefs, and, their, expulsion, from, the, country, g, mez, far, as, claimed, that, santa, anna, was, the, driving, force, for, the, law, which, evidence, seems, to, support, with, increasing, resistance, from, the, church, as, well, as, the, army, the, plan, of, cuernavaca, was, issued, likely, orchestrated, by, former, general, and, governor, of, the, federal, district, jos, mar, a, tornel, the, plan, called, for, repeal, of, the, ley, del, caso, discouraged, tolerance, of, the, influence, of, masonic, lodges, where, politics, was, pursued, in, secrecy, declared, void, the, laws, passed, by, congress, and, the, local, legislatures, in, favor, of, the, reforms, requested, the, protection, of, santa, anna, to, fulfill, the, plan, and, recognize, him, as, the, only, authority, removed, from, office, deputies, and, officials, who, carried, out, enforcement, of, the, reform, laws, and, decrees, and, provided, military, force, to, support, g, mez, far, as, in, implementing, the, plan, as, opinion, turned, against, the, reforms, santa, anna, was, persuaded, to, return, to, the, presidency, and, g, mez, far, as, resigned, this, set, the, stage, for, conservatives, to, reshape, mexico, s, government, from, a, federalist, republic, to, a, unitary, central, republic, for, conservatives, the, liberal, reform, of, g, mez, far, as, was, radical, and, threatened, the, power, of, the, elites, santa, anna, s, actions, in, allowing, this, first, reform, followed, by, a, more, sweeping, one, in, 1855, might, have, been, a, test, case, for, liberalism, at, this, point, santa, anna, was, a, liberal, by, giving, the, moderate, g, mez, far, as, responsibility, for, the, reforms, he, could, have, plausible, deniability, and, closely, monitor, the, reaction, to, a, comprehensive, attack, on, the, special, privileges, of, the, army, and, the, church, as, well, as, confiscation, of, church, wealth, enacted, by, congress, in, may, 1834, santa, anna, ordered, the, disarmament, of, the, civic, militia, and, urged, congress, to, abolish, the, controversial, ley, del, caso, on, 12, june, he, dissolved, congress, and, announced, his, decision, to, adopt, the, plan, of, cuernavaca, forming, a, new, catholic, centralist, and, conservative, government, santa, anna, brokered, a, deal, where, in, exchange, for, preserving, the, privileges, of, the, church, and, the, army, the, church, promised, a, monthly, donation, to, the, government, of, 30, 000, 40, 000, pesos, the, santanistas, succeeded, in, achieving, what, the, radicals, had, failed, to, do, forcing, the, church, to, assist, the, republic, s, daily, fiscal, needs, with, its, funds, and, properties, on, 4, january, 1835, santa, anna, returned, to, his, hacienda, placing, miguel, barrag, n, as, acting, president, he, soon, replaced, the, 1824, constitution, with, the, new, document, known, as, the, siete, leyes, the, seven, laws, santa, anna, did, not, involve, himself, with, the, conservative, effort, to, replace, the, federalist, constitution, with, a, unitary, central, government, seemingly, uneasy, with, their, political, path, although, he, has, been, blamed, for, the, change, to, centralism, he, was, not, actually, present, during, any, of, the, deliberations, that, led, to, the, abolition, of, the, federalist, charter, or, the, elaboration, of, the, 1836, constitution, several, states, openly, rebelled, against, the, changes, including, alta, california, nuevo, m, xico, tabasco, sonora, coahuila, y, tejas, san, luis, potos, quer, taro, durango, guanajuato, michoac, n, yucat, n, jalisco, nuevo, le, n, tamaulipas, and, zacatecas, several, of, these, states, formed, their, own, governments, the, republic, of, the, rio, grande, the, republic, of, yucat, n, and, the, republic, of, texas, their, fierce, resistance, was, possibly, fueled, by, santa, anna, s, reprisals, committed, against, his, defeated, enemies, the, new, york, post, editorialized, that, had, santa, anna, treated, the, vanquished, with, moderation, and, generosity, it, would, have, been, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, awaken, that, general, sympathy, for, the, people, of, texas, which, now, impels, so, many, adventurous, and, ardent, spirits, to, throng, to, the, aid, of, their, brethren, the, zacatecas, militia, the, largest, and, best, supplied, of, the, mexican, states, led, by, francisco, garc, a, salinas, was, well, armed, with, 753, caliber, british, brown, bess, muskets, and, baker, 61, rifles, but, after, two, hours, of, combat, on, 12, may, 1835, santa, anna, s, army, of, operations, defeated, the, zacatecan, militia, and, took, almost, 3, 000, prisoners, he, allowed, his, army, to, loot, zacatecas, city, for, forty, eight, hours, after, conquering, zacatecas, he, planned, to, move, on, to, coahuila, y, tejas, to, quell, the, rebellion, there, which, was, being, supported, by, settlers, from, the, united, states, in, 1835, santa, anna, repealed, the, mexican, constitution, which, ultimately, led, to, the, beginning, of, the, texas, revolution, his, reasoning, for, the, repeal, was, that, american, settlers, in, texas, were, not, paying, taxes, or, tariffs, claiming, they, were, not, recipients, of, any, services, provided, by, the, mexican, government, as, a, result, new, settlers, were, not, allowed, there, the, new, policy, was, a, response, to, the, u, s, attempts, to, purchase, texas, from, mexico, like, other, states, discontented, with, the, central, government, the, texas, department, of, the, mexican, state, of, coahuila, y, tejas, rebelled, in, late, 1835, and, declared, itself, independent, on, 2, march, 1836, the, northeastern, part, of, the, state, had, been, settled, by, numerous, american, immigrants, moses, austin, the, father, of, stephen, f, austin, had, his, party, accepted, by, spanish, authorities, in, exchange, for, defense, against, foreign, threats, however, mexico, had, declared, independence, from, spain, before, the, elder, austin, died, santa, anna, marched, north, to, bring, texas, back, under, mexican, control, by, a, brutal, show, of, force, his, expedition, posed, challenges, of, manpower, logistics, supply, and, strategy, far, beyond, what, he, was, prepared, for, and, it, ended, in, disaster, to, fund, organize, and, equip, his, army, santa, anna, relied, as, he, often, did, on, forcing, wealthy, men, to, loan, him, funds, he, recruited, hastily, sweeping, up, many, derelicts, and, ex, convicts, as, well, as, indians, who, could, not, understand, spanish, commands, having, expected, tropical, weather, santa, anna, s, army, suffered, from, cold, a, lack, of, proper, clothing, and, food, shortages, stretching, a, supply, line, far, longer, than, ever, before, there, were, not, enough, horses, mules, cattle, and, wagons, available, resulting, in, units, never, having, enough, food, fuel, or, feed, the, medical, facilities, were, minimal, and, poorly, supplied, morale, sank, as, soldiers, realized, there, were, not, enough, chaplains, to, properly, bury, their, bodies, hostile, indians, picked, off, stragglers, and, foragers, waterborne, sicknesses, spread, quickly, when, the, men, were, forced, to, drink, any, water, they, could, find, on, the, trail, the, officers, proved, to, be, mostly, incompetent, yet, the, highly, insulated, and, rigid, hierarchy, of, the, army, meant, that, santa, anna, was, kept, ignorant, of, these, problems, santa, anna, s, forces, killed, 189, texan, defenders, at, the, battle, of, the, alamo, on, 6, march, 1836, and, executed, more, than, 342, texan, prisoners, at, the, goliad, massacre, on, 27, march, 1836, however, his, forces, suffered, unexpectedly, heavy, casualties, in, an, 1874, letter, santa, anna, asserted, that, killing, the, defenders, of, alamo, was, his, only, option, stressing, that, texan, commander, william, b, travis, was, to, blame, for, the, degree, of, violence, during, the, battle, santa, anna, believed, that, travis, was, disrespectful, towards, him, and, that, if, he, had, spared, the, texans, it, would, have, allowed, sam, houston, to, establish, a, dominant, position, that, could, threaten, him, later, the, mexican, victory, at, the, alamo, bought, time, for, houston, and, his, texas, forces, during, the, siege, the, texian, navy, had, more, time, to, plunder, ports, along, the, gulf, of, mexico, and, the, texian, army, gained, more, experience, and, weaponry, despite, houston, s, lack, of, ability, to, maintain, strict, control, of, the, army, they, completely, routed, santa, anna, s, much, larger, army, at, the, battle, of, san, jacinto, on, 21, april, 1836, the, day, after, the, battle, a, small, texan, force, led, by, james, austin, sylvester, captured, santa, anna, near, a, marsh, the, general, had, hastily, dressed, himself, in, a, dead, mexican, dragoon, s, uniform, but, was, quickly, recognized, after, three, weeks, in, captivity, texas, president, david, g, burnet, and, santa, anna, signed, the, treaties, of, velasco, stating, that, in, his, official, character, as, chief, of, the, mexican, nation, he, acknowledged, the, full, entire, and, perfect, independence, of, the, republic, of, texas, in, exchange, burnet, and, the, texas, government, guaranteed, santa, anna, s, safety, and, transport, to, veracruz, meanwhile, in, mexico, city, a, new, government, declared, that, santa, anna, was, no, longer, president, and, that, the, treaties, were, null, and, void, while, santa, anna, was, held, captive, in, texas, poinsett, offered, a, harsh, assessment, of, his, situation, say, to, general, santa, anna, that, when, i, remember, how, ardent, an, advocate, he, was, of, liberty, ten, years, ago, i, have, no, sympathy, for, him, now, that, he, has, gotten, what, he, deserves, santa, anna, replied, say, to, mr, poinsett, that, it, is, very, true, that, i, threw, up, my, cap, for, liberty, with, great, ardor, and, perfect, sincerity, but, very, soon, found, the, folly, of, it, a, hundred, years, to, come, my, people, will, not, be, fit, for, liberty, they, do, not, know, what, it, is, unenlightened, as, they, are, and, under, the, influence, of, catholic, clergy, a, despotism, is, a, proper, government, for, them, but, there, is, no, reason, why, it, should, not, be, a, wise, and, virtuous, one, after, some, time, in, exile, and, after, meeting, u, s, president, andrew, jackson, in, 1837, santa, anna, was, allowed, to, return, to, mexico, he, was, transported, aboard, the, uss, pioneer, to, retire, to, his, hacienda, in, veracruz, there, he, wrote, a, manifesto, in, which, he, reflected, on, his, experiences, and, decision, making, in, texas, in, 1838, santa, anna, found, a, chance, for, redemption, from, the, loss, of, texas, after, mexico, rejected, demands, for, financial, compensation, for, losses, suffered, by, its, citizens, france, sent, forces, that, landed, in, veracruz, in, the, pastry, war, the, mexican, government, gave, santa, anna, control, of, the, army, and, ordered, him, to, defend, the, nation, by, any, means, necessary, santa, anna, engaged, the, french, at, veracruz, but, was, forced, to, retreat, after, a, failed, assault, sustaining, injuries, in, his, left, leg, and, hand, by, cannon, fire, his, shattered, ankle, required, amputation, of, much, of, his, leg, which, he, ordered, buried, with, full, military, honors, despite, mexico, s, final, capitulation, to, french, demands, santa, anna, used, his, war, service, and, visible, sacrifice, to, the, nation, to, re, enter, mexican, politics, soon, after, with, bustamante, s, presidency, descending, into, chaos, supporters, asked, santa, anna, to, take, control, of, the, provisional, government, santa, anna, was, made, president, for, the, fifth, time, taking, over, a, nation, with, an, empty, treasury, the, war, with, france, had, weakened, the, country, and, the, people, were, discontented, also, a, rebel, army, led, by, generals, jos, de, urrea, and, jos, antonio, mex, a, was, marching, towards, mexico, city, in, opposition, to, santa, anna, commanding, the, army, santa, anna, crushed, the, rebellion, in, puebla, santa, anna, ruled, in, a, more, dictatorial, fashion, than, during, his, first, administration, his, government, banned, anti, santanista, newspapers, and, jailed, dissidents, to, suppress, opposition, in, 1842, he, directed, a, military, expedition, into, texas, the, action, inflicted, numerous, casualties, with, no, political, gain, but, texans, began, to, be, persuaded, of, the, potential, benefits, of, annexation, by, the, more, powerful, u, s, following, the, 1842, elections, at, which, a, new, congress, was, elected, which, opposed, his, rule, santa, anna, attempted, to, restore, the, treasury, by, raising, taxes, several, mexican, states, stopped, dealing, with, the, central, government, in, response, and, yucat, n, and, laredo, declared, themselves, independent, republics, with, resentment, growing, santa, anna, stepped, down, and, fled, mexico, city, in, december, 1844, the, buried, leg, he, left, behind, in, the, capital, was, dug, up, by, a, mob, and, dragged, through, the, streets, until, nothing, was, left, of, it, fearing, for, his, life, santa, anna, tried, to, elude, capture, but, in, january, 1845, he, was, apprehended, by, a, group, of, native, americans, near, xico, they, turned, him, over, to, authorities, and, he, was, imprisoned, santa, anna, s, life, was, ultimately, spared, but, he, was, exiled, to, cuba, in, 1846, following, american, victories, at, palo, alto, and, resaca, de, la, palma, in, the, mexican, american, war, president, mariano, paredes, was, removed, from, office, with, the, new, government, seeking, to, reinstate, the, constitution, of, 1824, with, santa, anna, again, assuming, the, presidency, santa, anna, who, had, been, in, exile, for, only, a, year, returned, to, mexico, on, 6, august, 1846, two, days, after, paredes, ouster, he, wrote, to, the, new, government, stating, he, had, no, aspirations, to, the, presidency, but, would, eagerly, use, his, military, experience, in, the, new, conflict, with, the, u, s, u, s, president, james, k, polk, had, hoped, to, acquire, territory, in, the, north, by, purchase, or, force, but, the, mexican, government, was, not, willing, to, yield, in, a, gambit, to, change, the, dynamic, polk, sent, agents, to, secretly, meet, with, the, exiled, santa, anna, they, thought, they, had, extracted, a, promise, from, him, that, they, would, lift, a, blockade, of, the, mexican, coast, to, allow, him, to, return, and, that, he, would, broker, a, deal, once, back, in, mexico, at, the, head, of, an, army, however, santa, anna, reneged, on, the, deal, and, took, up, arms, against, the, u, s, invasion, with, no, path, now, for, a, quick, resolution, to, the, conflict, in, the, north, polk, authorized, an, invasion, to, take, mexico, city, redirecting, the, bulk, of, general, zachary, taylor, s, troops, to, general, winfield, scott, s, army, santa, anna, mobilized, troops, and, artillery, and, rapidly, marched, north, his, forces, outnumbered, taylor, s, but, his, troops, were, exhausted, ill, clothed, hungry, and, equipped, with, inferior, weapons, when, the, two, armies, clashed, at, the, battle, of, buena, vista, on, 22, 23, february, 1847, hard, fighting, over, two, days, brought, an, inconclusive, result, with, santa, anna, withdrawing, from, the, field, of, battle, overnight, just, as, complete, victory, was, at, hand, taking, war, trophies, such, as, cannons, and, battle, flags, as, evidence, of, his, victory, with, scott, s, army, landing, at, veracruz, santa, anna, s, home, ground, he, rapidly, moved, southward, to, engage, with, the, invaders, and, protect, the, capital, for, the, mexicans, it, would, have, been, better, if, scott, could, have, been, prevented, from, leaving, the, gulf, coast, but, they, could, not, prevent, scott, s, march, on, xalapa, santa, anna, set, defenses, at, cerro, gordo, u, s, forces, outflanked, him, and, against, strong, odds, defeated, his, army, with, that, battle, the, way, was, clear, for, scott, s, forces, to, advance, further, onto, mexico, city, santa, anna, s, aim, was, to, protect, the, capital, at, all, costs, and, waged, defensive, warfare, placing, strong, defenses, on, the, most, direct, road, into, the, city, at, el, pe, on, which, scott, then, avoided, battles, at, contreras, churubusco, and, molino, del, rey, were, lost, at, contreras, mexican, general, gabriel, valencia, an, old, political, and, military, rival, of, santa, anna, s, did, not, recognize, his, authority, as, supreme, commander, and, disobeyed, his, orders, as, to, where, his, troops, should, be, placed, valencia, s, army, of, the, north, was, routed, the, battle, for, mexico, city, and, the, battle, of, chapultepec, like, the, others, were, hard, fought, losses, and, american, forces, took, the, capital, despite, his, many, faults, as, a, tactician, and, his, overbearing, political, ambition, santa, anna, was, committed, to, fighting, to, the, bitter, end, his, actions, would, prolong, the, war, for, at, least, a, year, and, more, than, any, other, single, person, it, was, santa, anna, who, denied, polk, s, dream, of, a, short, war, perhaps, santa, anna, s, most, personal, and, ignominious, incident, in, the, war, was, the, capture, during, the, battle, of, cerro, gordo, of, his, prosthetic, cork, leg, which, remains, as, a, war, trophy, in, the, u, s, held, by, the, illinois, state, military, museum, but, no, longer, on, display, a, second, leg, a, peg, was, also, captured, by, the, 4th, illinois, and, was, reportedly, used, by, the, soldiers, as, a, baseball, bat, it, is, displayed, at, the, home, of, illinois, governor, richard, j, oglesby, who, served, in, the, regiment, in, decatur, santa, anna, had, a, replacement, leg, made, which, is, displayed, at, the, museo, nacional, de, historia, in, mexico, city, the, prosthetic, leg, later, played, a, role, in, international, politics, as, relations, between, the, u, s, and, mexico, warmed, during, the, run, up, to, world, war, ii, illinois, was, rumored, to, be, ready, to, return, the, prosthetic, to, mexico, and, in, 1942, a, bill, was, introduced, in, the, state, legislature, the, association, of, limb, manufacturers, wanted, to, be, part, of, the, repatriation, ceremonies, the, state, passed, a, non, binding, resolution, to, return, the, prosthetic, but, the, national, guard, denied, the, transfer, as, of, 2016, the, leg, still, resided, in, the, illinois, state, military, museum, in, springfield, following, mexico, s, defeat, in, 1848, santa, anna, went, into, exile, in, kingston, jamaica, two, years, later, he, moved, to, turbaco, in, new, granada, now, colombia, in, april, 1853, he, was, invited, to, return, to, mexico, by, conservatives, who, had, overthrown, a, weak, liberal, government, initiated, under, the, plan, de, hospicio, drawn, up, by, the, clerics, in, the, cathedral, chapter, of, guadalajara, usually, revolts, were, fomented, by, military, officers, this, one, was, fomented, by, churchmen, santa, anna, was, elected, president, on, 17, march, 1853, he, honored, his, promises, to, the, church, revoking, a, decree, denying, protection, for, the, fulfillment, of, monastic, vows, a, reform, promulgated, twenty, years, earlier, by, g, mez, far, as, the, jesuits, who, had, been, expelled, from, spanish, realms, by, the, crown, in, 1767, were, allowed, to, return, to, mexico, ostensibly, to, educate, poorer, classes, and, much, of, their, property, which, the, crown, had, confiscated, and, sold, was, restored, to, them, although, he, gave, himself, exalted, titles, santa, anna, s, situation, was, quite, vulnerable, he, declared, himself, dictator, for, life, with, the, title, most, serene, highness, his, full, title, in, this, final, period, of, power, was, hero, of, the, nation, general, of, division, grand, master, of, the, national, and, distinguished, order, of, guadalupe, grand, cross, of, the, royal, and, distinguished, spanish, order, of, carlos, iii, and, president, of, the, mexican, republic, the, reality, was, that, this, administration, was, no, more, successful, than, his, earlier, ones, dependent, on, loans, from, moneylenders, and, support, from, conservative, elites, the, church, and, the, army, a, major, miscalculation, was, santa, anna, s, sale, of, territory, to, the, u, s, in, what, became, known, as, the, gadsden, purchase, la, mesilla, the, land, in, northwest, mexico, that, the, u, s, wanted, was, much, easier, terrain, for, the, building, of, a, transcontinental, railway, in, the, u, s, the, purchase, money, for, the, land, was, supposedly, to, go, to, mexico, s, empty, treasury, santa, anna, was, unwilling, to, wait, until, the, final, transaction, went, through, and, the, boundary, line, established, wanting, access, to, the, money, immediately, he, bargained, with, american, bankers, to, get, immediate, cash, while, they, gained, the, right, to, the, revenue, when, the, sale, closed, santa, anna, s, short, sighted, deal, netted, the, mexican, government, only, 250, 000, against, credit, of, 650, 000, going, to, the, bankers, james, gadsden, thought, the, amount, was, likely, much, higher, a, group, of, liberals, including, alvarez, benito, ju, rez, and, ignacio, comonfort, overthrew, santa, anna, under, the, plan, of, ayutla, which, called, for, his, removal, from, office, he, went, into, exile, yet, again, in, 1855, santa, anna, married, twice, both, times, to, wealthy, young, women, at, neither, wedding, ceremony, did, he, appear, legally, empowering, his, future, father, in, law, to, serve, as, a, proxy, at, his, first, wedding, and, a, friend, at, his, second, one, assessment, of, the, two, marriages, is, that, they, were, arranged, marriages, of, convenience, bringing, considerable, wealth, to, santa, anna, and, that, his, lack, of, attendance, at, the, ceremonies, appears, to, confirm, that, he, was, purely, interested, in, the, financial, aspect, o, the, alliance, in, 1825, santa, anna, married, in, s, garc, a, the, daughter, of, wealthy, spanish, parents, in, veracruz, and, the, couple, had, four, children, mar, a, de, guadalupe, mar, a, del, carmen, manuel, and, antonio, l, pez, de, santa, anna, y, garc, a, by, 1825, santa, anna, had, distinguished, himself, as, a, military, man, joining, the, movement, for, independence, when, iturbide, lost, support, santa, anna, had, been, in, the, forefront, of, leaders, seeking, to, oust, him, although, his, family, was, of, modest, means, santa, anna, was, of, good, creole, lineage, the, garc, a, family, may, well, have, seen, a, match, between, their, young, daughter, and, the, up, and, coming, santa, anna, as, advantageous, in, s, dowry, allowed, santa, anna, to, purchase, the, first, of, his, haciendas, manga, de, clavo, in, veracruz, the, first, spanish, ambassador, to, mexico, and, his, wife, fanny, calder, n, de, la, barca, visited, with, in, s, at, manga, de, clavo, where, they, were, well, received, with, a, breakfast, banquet, calder, n, de, la, barca, observed, that, after, breakfast, the, se, ora, having, dispatched, an, officer, for, her, cigar, case, which, was, gold, with, a, diamond, latch, offered, me, a, cigar, which, i, having, declined, she, lighted, her, own, a, little, paper, cigarette, and, the, gentlemen, followed, her, good, example, two, months, after, the, death, of, his, wife, in, s, in, 1844, the, 50, year, old, santa, anna, married, 16, year, old, mar, a, de, los, dolores, de, tosta, the, couple, rarely, lived, together, de, tosta, resided, primarily, in, mexico, city, and, santa, anna, s, political, and, military, activities, took, him, around, the, country, they, had, no, children, leading, biographer, will, fowler, to, speculate, that, either, the, marriage, was, primarily, platonic, or, de, tosta, was, infertile, several, women, claimed, to, have, borne, santa, anna, natural, children, in, his, will, he, acknowledged, and, made, provisions, for, four, paula, mar, a, de, la, merced, petra, and, jos, l, pez, de, santa, anna, biographers, have, identified, three, more, pedro, l, pez, de, santa, anna, and, ngel, and, augustina, rosa, l, pez, de, santa, anna, from, 1855, to, 1874, santa, anna, lived, in, exile, in, cuba, the, united, states, colombia, and, saint, thomas, he, had, left, mexico, because, of, his, unpopularity, with, the, mexican, people, after, his, defeat, in, 1848, santa, anna, participated, in, gambling, and, businesses, with, the, hopes, that, he, would, become, rich, during, his, many, years, in, exile, he, was, a, passionate, fan, of, the, sport, of, cockfighting, he, had, many, roosters, that, he, entered, into, competitions, and, would, have, his, roosters, compete, with, cocks, from, all, over, the, world, in, the, 1850s, santa, anna, traveled, to, new, york, city, with, a, shipment, of, chicle, which, he, intended, to, sell, for, use, in, making, carriage, wheels, he, attempted, but, was, unsuccessful, in, convincing, u, s, wheel, manufacturers, that, this, substance, could, be, more, useful, in, tires, than, the, materials, they, were, originally, using, although, he, introduced, chewing, gum, to, the, u, s, santa, anna, did, not, make, any, money, from, the, product, thomas, adams, the, american, assigned, to, aid, santa, anna, while, he, was, in, the, u, s, experimented, with, chicle, in, an, attempt, to, use, it, as, a, substitute, for, rubber, he, bought, one, ton, of, the, substance, from, santa, anna, but, his, experiments, proved, unsuccessful, instead, adams, helped, to, found, the, chewing, gum, industry, with, a, product, that, he, called, chiclets, in, 1865, santa, anna, attempted, to, return, to, mexico, and, offer, his, services, during, the, french, invasion, seeking, once, again, to, play, the, role, as, the, country, s, defender, and, savior, only, to, be, refused, by, ju, rez, later, that, year, a, schooner, owned, by, gilbert, thompson, son, in, law, of, daniel, tompkins, brought, santa, anna, to, his, home, in, staten, island, where, he, tried, to, raise, money, for, an, army, to, return, and, take, over, mexico, city, in, 1874, santa, anna, took, advantage, of, a, general, amnesty, issued, by, president, sebasti, n, lerdo, de, tejada, and, returned, to, mexico, by, then, crippled, and, almost, blind, from, cataracts, he, died, at, his, home, in, mexico, city, on, 21, june, 1876, at, age, 82, santa, anna, was, buried, with, full, military, honors, in, a, glass, coffin, in, pante, n, del, tepeyac, cemetery, santa, anna, was, highly, controversial, at, the, time, and, ever, since, in, the, 2007, biography, by, will, fowler, he, was, depicted, as, a, liberal, a, republican, an, army, man, a, hero, a, revolutionary, a, regional, strongman, but, never, a, politician, he, presented, himself, as, a, mediator, who, was, both, anti, party, and, anti, politics, in, the, decades, when, the, new, country, of, mexico, was, wracked, by, factional, infighting, he, was, always, more, willing, to, lead, an, army, than, to, lead, his, country
