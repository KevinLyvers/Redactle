comic, strip, authored, by, one, of, the, paper, s, sport, columnists, which, told, the, story, of, two, boys, one, of, their, little, sisters, and, her, inflatable, rubber, pig, herg, was, unsatisfied, and, eager, to, write, and, draw, a, comic, strip, of, his, own, he, was, fascinated, by, new, techniques, in, the, medium, such, as, the, systematic, use, of, speech, bubbles, found, in, such, us, comics, as, george, mcmanus, bringing, up, father, george, herriman, s, krazy, kat, and, rudolph, dirks, s, the, katzenjammer, kids, copies, of, which, had, been, sent, to, him, from, mexico, by, the, paper, s, reporter, l, on, degrelle, stationed, there, to, report, on, the, cristero, war, herg, developed, a, character, named, tintin, as, a, belgian, boy, reporter, who, could, travel, the, world, with, his, fox, terrier, snowy, milou, in, the, original, french, basing, him, in, large, part, on, his, earlier, character, of, totor, and, also, on, his, own, brother, paul, degrelle, later, falsely, claimed, that, tintin, had, been, based, on, him, while, he, and, herg, fell, out, when, degrelle, used, one, of, his, designs, without, permission, they, settled, out, of, court, although, herg, wanted, to, send, his, character, to, the, united, states, wallez, instead, ordered, him, to, set, his, adventure, in, the, soviet, union, acting, as, a, work, of, anti,

serialisation, of, the, second, tintin, adventure, tintin, in, the, congo, designed, to, encourage, colonial, sentiment, towards, the, belgian, congo, authored, in, a, paternalistic, style, that, depicted, the, congolese, as, childlike, idiots, in, later, decades, it, would, be, accused, of, racism, however, at, the, time, it, was, un, controversial, and, popular, with, further, publicity, stunts, held, to, increase, sales, for, the, third, adventure, tintin, in, america, serialised, from, september, 1931, to, october, 1932, herg, finally, got, to, deal, with, a, scenario, of, his, own, choice, although, he, used, the, work, to, push, an, anti, capitalist, anti, consumerist, agenda, in, keeping, with, the, paper, s, ultra, conservative, ideology, although, the, adventures, of, tintin, had, been, serialised, in, the, french, catholic, c, urs, vaillants, brave, hearts, since, 1930, he, was, soon, receiving, syndication, requests, from, swiss, and, portuguese, newspapers, too, though, wealthier, than, most, belgians, at, his, age, and, despite, increasing, success, he, remained, an, unfazed, conservative, young, man, dedicated, to, his, work, herg, sought, work, elsewhere, too, creating, the, lovable, mr, mops, cartoon, for, the, bon, march, department, store, and, the, adventures, of, tim, the, squirrel, out, west, for, the, rival, l, innovation, department, store, at,

earlier, child, they, were, particularly, overprotective, of, her, greatly, admiring, wallez, whom, she, looked, up, to, as, a, father, figure, she, adopted, his, fascist, political, beliefs, she, was, appointed, editor, of, votre, vingti, me, madame, a, supplement, for, women, for, which, herg, sometimes, drew, the, cover, she, also, began, writing, articles, for, le, petit, vingti, me, using, the, pseudonym, tantine, the, first, 500, copies, of, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, soviets, were, numbered, and, signed, by, herg, using, tintin, s, signature, with, snowy, s, paw, print, being, drawn, next, to, it, by, kieckens, in, 1930, herg, escorted, her, home, from, work, almost, every, night, though, she, expressed, little, romantic, interest, in, him, at, the, time, instead, she, desired, an, older, or, more, mature, man, such, as, the, abb, himself, wallez, however, encouraged, the, two, to, enter, into, a, relationship, and, one, evening, at, the, taverne, du, palace, she, indicated, to, herg, that, she, would, be, interested, in, a, relationship, on, 20, july, 1932, herg, and, kieckens, were, married, although, neither, of, them, was, entirely, happy, with, the, union,

in, laeken, spending, their, honeymoon, in, vianden, luxembourg, the, couple, moved, into, an, apartment, in, the, rue, knapen, schaerbeek, in, november, 1932, herg, announced, that, the, following,

both, the, adventures, of, tintin, and, quick, and, flupke, in, book, form, to, which, herg, agreed, the, first, casterman, book, was, the, collected, volume, of, cigars, continuing, to, subsidise, his, comic, work, with, commercial, advertising, in, january, 1934, he, also, founded, the, atelier, herg, advertising, company, with, two, partners, but, it, was, liquidated, after, six, months, after, wallez, was, removed, from, the, paper, s, editorship, in, august, 1933, following, a, scandal, herg, became, despondent, in, march, 1934, he, tried, to, resign, but, was, encouraged, to, stay,

vingti, me, from, february, to, august, 1934, herg, serialised, popol, out, west, in, le, petit, vingti, me, a, story, using, animal, characters, that, was, a, development, of, the, earlier, tim, the, squirrel, comic, from, august, 1934, to, october, 1935, le, petit, vingti, me, serialised, tintin, s, next, adventure, the, blue, lotus, which, was, set, in, china, and, dealt, with, the, recent, japanese, invasion, of, manchuria, herg, had, been, greatly, influenced, in, the, production, of, the, work, by, his, friend, zhang, chongren, a, catholic, chinese, student, studying, at, brussels, acad, mie, royale, des, beaux, arts, to, whom, he, had, been, introduced, in, may, 1934, zhang, gave, him, lessons, in, taoist, philosophy, chinese, art, and, chinese, calligraphy, influencing, not, only, his, artistic, style, but, also, his, general, outlook, on, life, as, a, token, of, appreciation, herg, added, a, fictional, chang, chong, chen, to, the, blue, lotus, a, young, chinese, boy, who, meets, and, befriends, tintin, for, the, blue, lotus, herg, devoted, far, more, attention, to, accuracy, resulting, in, a, largely, realistic, portrayal, of, china, as, a, result, the, blue, lotus, has, been, widely, hailed, as, herg, s, first, masterpiece, and, a, benchmark, in, the, series, development, casterman, published, it, in, book, form, also, insisting, that, herg, include, colour, plates, in, both, the, volume, and, in, reprints, of, america, and, cigars, in, 1936, they, also, began, production, of, tintin, merchandise, something, herg, supported, having, ideas, of, an, entire, shop, devoted, to, the, adventures, of, tintin, something, that, would, come, to, fruition, 50, years, later, nevertheless, while, his, serialised, comics, proved, lucrative, the, collected, volumes, sold, less, well, something, herg, blamed, on, casterman, urging, them, to, do, more, to, market, his, books, herg, s, next, tintin, story, the, broken, ear, 1935, 1937, was, the, first, for, which, the, plot, synopsis, had, been, outlined, from, the, start, being, a, detective, story, that, took, tintin, to, south, america, it, introduced, the, character, of, general, alcazar, and, also, saw, herg, introduce, the, first, fictional, countries, into, the, series, san, theodoros, and, nuevo, rico, two, republics, based, largely, on, bolivia, and, paraguay, the, violent, elements, within, the, broken, ear, upset, the, publishers, of, c, urs, vaillants, who, asked, herg, to, create, a, more, child, appropriate, story, for, them, the, result, was, the, adventures, of, jo, zette, and, jocko, a, series, about, a, young, brother, and, sister, plus, their, pet, monkey, and, the, parents, the, series, began, with, the, secret, ray, which, was, serialised, in, c, urs, vaillants, and, then, le, petit, vingti, me, and, continued, with, the, stratoship, h, 22, and, finally, the, valley, of, the, cobras, herg, nevertheless, disliked, the, series, commenting, that, the, characters, bored, me, terribly, now, writing, three, series, simultaneously, herg, was, working, every, day, of, the, year, and, felt, stressed, the, next, tintin, adventure, was, the, black, island, 1937, 1938, which, saw, the, character, travel, to, britain, to, battle, counterfeiters, and, introduced, a, new, antagonist, the, german, dr, m, ller, herg, followed, this, with, king, ottokar, s, sceptre, 1938, 1939, in, which, tintin, saves, the, fictional, eastern, european, country, of, syldavia, from, being, invaded, by, its, expansionist, neighbour, borduria, the, event, was, an, anti, fascist, satire, of, nazi, germany, s, expansion, into, austria, and, czechoslovakia, in, may, 1939, herg, moved, to, a, new, house, in, watermael, boitsfort, although, following, the, german, invasion, of, poland, he, was, conscripted, into, the, belgian, army, and, temporarily, stationed, in, herenthout, demobbed, within, the, month, he, returned, to, brussels, and, adopted, a, more, explicit, anti, german, stance, when, beginning, his, next, tintin, adventure, land, of, black, gold, which, was, set, in, the, middle, east, and, featured, dr, m, ller, sabotaging, oil, lines, during, this, period, herg,

creating, the, mr, bellum, strip, to, argue, this, position, herg, was, invited, to, visit, china, by, chinese, nationalist, leader, chiang, kai, shek, who, had, enjoyed, the, blue, lotus, although, due, to, the, political, situation, in, europe, this, was, not, possible, he, was, re, mobilized, in, december, and, stationed, in, antwerp, from, where, he, continued, to, send, the, tintin, strip, to, le, petit, vingti, me, however, he, fell, ill, with, sinusitis, and, boils, and, was, declared, unfit, for, military, service, in, may, 1940, that, same, day, germany, invaded, belgium, le, vingti, me, si, cle, was, shut, down, part, way, through, the, serialisation, of, land, of, black, gold, it, is, certain, that, raymond, de, becker, sympathized, with, the, national, socialist, system, and, on, this, point, he, was, in, agreement, with, henri, de, man, i, admit, that, i, believed, myself, that, the, future, of, the, west, could, depend, on, the, new, order, for, many, people, democracy, had, proven, deceptive, and, the, new, order, brought, fresh, hope, in, catholic, circles, such, views, were, widely, held, given, everything, that, happened, it, was, naturally, a,

leopold, iii, of, the, belgians, surrendered, the, country, to, the, german, army, to, prevent, further, killing, a, move, that, herg, supported, he, followed, the, king, s, request, that, all, of, those, belgians, who, had, fled, the, country, return, arriving, back, in, brussels, on, 30, june, there, he, found, that, his, house, had, been, occupied, as, an, office, for, the, german, army, s, propagandastaffel, and, also, faced, financial, trouble, as, he, owed, back, taxes, yet, was, unable, to, access, his, financial, reserves, all, belgian, publications, were, now, under, the, control, of, the, german, occupying, force, who, refused, le, petit, vingti, me, permission, to, continue, publication, instead, herg, was, offered, employment, as, a, cartoonist, for, le, pays, r, el, by, its, editor, the, rexist, victor, matthys, but, herg, perceived, le, pays, r, el, as, an, explicitly, political, publication, and, thus, declined, the, position, instead, he, took, up, a, position, with, le, soir, belgium, s, largest, francophone, daily, newspaper, confiscated, from, its, original, owners, the, german, authorities, had, permitted, le, soir, to, be, re, opened, under, the, directorship, of, de, doncker, although, it, remained, firmly, under, nazi, control, supporting, the, german, war, effort, and, espousing, anti, semitism, after, joining, the, le, soir, team, on, 15, october, herg, was, involved, in, the, creation, of, a, children, s, supplement, soir, jeunesse, aided, by, jamin, and, jacques, van, melkebeke, he, relaunched, the, adventures, of, tintin, with, a, new, story, the, crab, with, the, golden, claws, in, which, tintin, pursued, drug, smugglers, in, north, africa, the, story, was, a, turning, point, in, the, series, for, its, introduction, of, captain, haddock, who, would, become, a, major, character, in, the, rest, of, the, adventures, this, story, like, the, subsequent, adventures, of, tintin, published, in, le, soir, would, reject, the, political, themes, present, in, earlier, stories, instead, remaining, firmly, neutral, herg, also, included, new, quick, flupke, gags, in, the, supplement, as, well, as, illustrations, for, serialised, stories, by, edgar, allan, poe, and, the, brothers, grimm, in, may, 1941, a, paper, shortage, led, to, the, soir, jeunesse, being, reduced, to, four, pages, with, the, length, of, the, tintin, strip, being, cut, by, two, thirds, several, weeks, later, the, supplement, disappeared, altogether, with, the, crab, with, the, golden, claws, being, moved, into, le, soir, itself, where, it, became, a, daily, strip, while, some, belgians, were, upset, that, herg, was, willing, to, work, for, a, newspaper, controlled, by, the, occupying, nazi, administration, he, was, heavily, enticed, by, the, size, of, le, soir, s, readership, which, reached, 600, 000, with, van, melkebeke, herg, put, together, two, tintin, plays, the, first, tintin, in, the, indies, appeared, at, brussels, theatre, des, galeries, in, april, 1941, while, the, second, mr, boullock, s, disappearance, was, performed, there, in, december, from, october, 1941, to, may, 1942, le, soir, serialised, herg, s, next, tintin, adventure, the, shooting, star, followed, by, publication, as, a, single, volume, by, casterman, in, keeping, with, le, soir, s, editorial, standpoint, the, shooting, star, espoused, an, anti, semitic, and, anti, american, attitude, with, the, antagonist, being, a, wealthy, jewish, american, businessman, it, would, thus, prove, particularly, controversial, in, the, post, war, period, although, herg, denied, any, malicious, anti, semitic, intention, casterman, felt, that, the, black, and, white, volumes, of, the, adventures, of, tintin, were, not, selling, as, well, as, colour, comic, books, and, thus, that, the, series, should, be, produced, in, colour, at, the, same, time, belgium, was, facing, a, paper, shortage, with, casterman, wishing, to, cut, down, the, volumes, from, 120, pages, in, length, to, 62, herg, was, initially, sceptical, but, ultimately, agreed, to, their, demands, in, february, 1942, for, these, new, editions, casterman, introduced, a, four, colour, system, although, herg, insisted, that, colour, should, remain, secondary, to, line, and, that, it, would, not, be, used, for, shading, to, cope, with, this, additional, workload, herg, approached, a, friend, whom, he, had, met, through, van, melkebeke, edgar, p, jacobs, to, aid, him, as, a, cartoonist, and, colourist, jacobs, could, only, work, on, the, project, part, time, and, so, in, march, 1942, herg, also, employed, a, woman, named, alice, devos, to, aid, him, in, july, 1942, herg, then, procured, an, agent, bernard, thi, ry, who, took, 40, of, his, commissions, their, working, relationship, would, be, strained, with, their, assistance, from, 1942, to, 1947, herg, adapted, most, of, his, previous, adventures, of, tintin, into, 62, page, colour, versions, herg, s, next, adventure, of, tintin, would, be, the, secret, of, the, unicorn, serialised, in, le, soir, from, june, 1942, he, had, collaborated, closely, with, van, melkebeke, on, this, project, who, had, introduced, many, elements, from, the, work, of, jules, verne, into, the, detective, story, in, which, tintin, and, haddock, searched, for, parchments, revealing, the, location, of, hidden, pirate, treasure, the, secret, of, the, unicorn, marked, the, first, half, of, a, story, arc, that, was, completed, in, red, rackham, s, treasure, serialised, in, le, soir, from, february, 1943, in, this, story, tintin, and, haddock, search, for, the, pirate, s, treasure, in, the, caribbean, with, the, character, of, professor, calculus, being, introduced, to, the, series, following, red, rackham, s, treasure, herg, drew, illustrations, for, a, serialised, story, titled, dupont, et, dupond, d, tectives, thomson, and, thompson, detectives, authored, by, the, newspaper, s, crime, editor, paul, kinnet, in, september, 1943, de, becker, was, removed, as, editor, of, le, soir, for, stating, that, although, the, nazis, were, motivated, by, undoubted, good, will, extremely, out, of, touch, with, reality, although, herg, was, close, to, de, becker, he, decided, to, remain, at, the, newspaper, which, came, under, the, editorship, of, max, hodeige, in, autumn, 1943, herg, had, decided, that, he, wanted, jacobs, to, collaborate, with, him, on, the, adventures, of, tintin, although, initially, hesitant, jacobs, eventually, agreed, adopting, the, paid, position, in, january, 1944, jacobs, and, herg, became, close, collaborators, and, greatly, influenced, each, other, while, together, they, developed, the, plot, for, the, next, adventure, of, tintin, the, seven, crystal, balls, which, began, serialisation, in, le, soir, in, december, 1943, as, the, allied, troops, liberated, brussels, from, german, occupation, le, soir, ceased, publication, on, 2, september, 1944, partway, through, its, serialisation, of, the, seven, crystal, balls, herg, was, arrested, on, 3, september, having, been, named, as, a, collaborator, in, a, resistance, document, known, as, the, gallery, of, traitors, this, would, be, the, first, of, four, incidents, in, which, herg, was, arrested, by, the, state, security, the, judiciary, police, the, belgian, national, movement, and, the, front, for, independence, respectively, during, the, course, of, which, he, spent, one, night, in, jail, on, 5, september, the, entire, staff, of, le, soir, were, fired, and, a, new, editorial, team, introduced, while, on, 8, september, the, supreme, headquarters, allied, expeditionary, force, shaef, issued, a, proclamation, announcing, that, any, journalist, who, had, helped, produce, a, newspaper, during, the, occupation, was, for, the, time, being, barred, from, practising, his, profession, blacklisted, herg, was, now, unemployed, further, he, was, publicly, lampooned, as, a, collaborator, by, a, newspaper, closely, associated, with, the, belgian, resistance, la, patrie, which, issued, a, satirical, strip, titled, the, adventures, of, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, nazis, the, period, witnessed, widespread, recriminations, against, accused, collaborators, with, military, courts, condemning, 30, 000, on, minor, charges, and, 25, 000, on, more, serious, charges, of, those, 5, 500, were, sentenced, to, life, imprisonment, or, capital, punishment, a, judiciary, inquiry, into, herg, s, case, was, launched, by, the, deputy, public, prosecutor, mr, vin, otte, although, in, his, report, he, urged, lenience, stating, that, i, am, inclined, to, close, the, case, i, believe, it, would, bring, ridicule, on, the, judicial, system, to, go, after, an, inoffensive, children, s, book, author, and, illustrator, on, the, other, hand, herg, worked, for, le, soir, during, the, war, and, his, illustrations, are, what, made, people, buy, the, newspaper, although, unable, to, work, for, the, press, herg, continued, to, re, draw, and, colour, the, older, adventures, of, tintin, for, publication, in, book, form, by, casterman, completing, the, second, version, of, tintin, in, the, congo, and, starting, on, king, ottokar, s, sceptre, casterman, supported, herg, throughout, his, ordeal, for, which, he, always, remained, grateful, attempting, to, circumvent, his, blacklisting, with, jacobs, he, began, producing, comics, under, the, anonymous, pseudonym, of, olav, but, upon, sending, them, to, publishers, found, none, who, would, accept, them, although, this, period, allowed, him, an, escape, from, the, pressure, of, daily, production, which, had, affected, most, of, his, working, life, he, also, had, to, deal, with, family, problems, his, brother, paul, returned, to, brussels, from, a, german, prisoner, of, war, camp, although, their, mother, had, become, highly, delusional, and, was, moved, to, a, psychiatric, hospital, i, worked, just, like, a, miner, a, tram, driver, or, baker, but, while, one, found, it, normal, for, an, engineer, to, operate, a, train, members, of, the, press, were, labelled, as, traitors, herg, in, october, 1945, herg, was, approached, by, raymond, leblanc, a, former, member, of, a, conservative, resistance, group, the, national, royalist, movement, and, his, associates, andr, sinave, and, albert, debaty, the, trio, were, planning, on, launching, a, weekly, magazine, for, children, and, leblanc, who, had, fond, childhood, memories, of, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, soviets, thought, herg, would, be, ideal, for, it, herg, agreed, and, leblanc, obtained, clearance, papers, for, him, allowing, him, to, work, concerned, about, the, judicial, investigation, into, herg, s, wartime, affiliations, leblanc, convinced, william, ugeux, a, leader, of, the, belgian, resistance, who, was, now, in, charge, of, censorship, and, certificates, of, good, citizenship, to, look, into, the, comic, creator, s, file, ugeux, concluded, that, herg, had, been, a, blunderer, rather, than, a, traitor, for, his, work, at, le, soir, the, decision, as, to, whether, herg, would, stand, trial, belonged, to, the, general, auditor, of, the, military, tribunal, walter, jean, ganshof, van, der, meersch, he, closed, the, case, on, 22, december, 1945, declaring, that, in, regard, to, the, particularly, inoffensive, character, of, the, drawings, published, by, remi, bringing, him, before, a, war, tribunal, would, be, inappropriate, and, risky, now, free, from, threat, of, prosecution, herg, continued, to, support, his, colleagues, at, le, soir, who, were, being, charged, as, collaborators, six, of, them, were, sentenced, to, death, and, others, to, lengthy, prison, sentences, among, those, sentenced, to, death, was, herg, s, friend, jamin, although, his, sentence, was, commuted, to, life, imprisonment, in, may, 1946, herg, was, issued, a, certificate, of, good, citizenship, which, became, largely, necessary, to, obtain, employment, in, post, war, belgium, celebrations, were, marred, by, his, mother, s, death, in, april, 1946, she, was, aged, 60, harry, thompson, has, described, this, post, war, period, as, the, greatest, upheaval, of, herg, s, life, herg, later, described, it, as, an, experience, of, absolute, intolerance, it, was, horrible, horrible, he, considered, the, post, war, trials, of, alleged, collaborators, a, great, injustice, inflicted, upon, many, innocent, people, and, never, forgave, belgian, society, for, the, way, that, he, had, been, treated, although, he, hid, this, from, his, public, persona, sinave, devised, the, idea, of, naming, their, new, magazine, tintin, believing, that, this, would, attract, a, wide, audience, the, dutch, language, edition, produced, for, release, in, belgium, s, flemish, north, was, titled, kuifje, after, the, character, s, dutch, language, name, adopting, the, slogan, of, the, newspaper, for, the, young, aged, 7, to, 77, the, magazine, also, used, a, logo, featuring, the, tintin, character, himself, the, capital, for, the, project, had, been, put, up, by, those, involved, as, executive, director, leblanc, provided, 50, while, its, managing, director, georges, lallemand, provided, 40, and, herg, its, artistic, director, provided, 10, herg, assembled, a, group, of, associates, to, aid, him, including, van, melkebeke, jacobs, paul, cuvelier, and, jacques, laudy, van, melkebeke, was, initially, appointed, editor, in, chief, although, he, was, arrested, for, having, worked, for, the, collaborationist, le, nouveau, journal, shortly, after, with, his, involvement, in, the, project, thus, being, kept, secret, so, as, to, avoid, further, controversy, van, melkebeke, continued, to, provide, work, for, the, magazine, under, pseudonyms, although, this, ceased, during, his, imprisonment, from, december, 1947, to, october, 1949, the, first, issue, of, tintin, magazine, was, published, on, 26, september, 1946, herg, was, assigned, to, produce, a, two, page, spread, each, week, and, began, by, concluding, the, seven, crystal, balls, before, embarking, on, its, successor, story, prisoners, of, the, sun, alongside, herg, s, adventures, of, tintin, the, magazine, also, included, laudy, s, the, legend, of, the, four, aymon, brothers, and, jacobs, the, secret, of, the, swordfish, the, first, in, his, new, blake, and, mortimer, series, while, the, magazine, was, in, competition, with, a, number, of, rivals, most, notably, spirou, famous, for, serialising, the, lucky, luke, and, buck, danny, comics, it, proved, an, immediate, success, with, 60, 000, copies, being, sold, in, three, days, of, its, release, its, publication, resulted, in, a, massive, boost, to, herg, s, book, sales, too, in, 1947, a, belgian, film, adaptation, of, the, crab, with, the, golden, claws, was, produced, and, believing, that, cinematic, adaptations, were, a, good, way, to, proceed, herg, contacted, disney, studios, in, the, united, states, they, declined, his, offer, to, adapt, the, adventures, of, tintin, for, the, silver, screen, in, may, 1947, the, artistic, collaboration, between, herg, and, jacobs, ended, after, an, argument, herg, had, been, jealous, of, the, immediate, success, of, jacobs, blake, and, mortimer, series, and, had, turned, down, jacobs, request, that, he, be, credited, as, co, creator, of, the, new, adventures, of, tintin, that, same, month, herg, broke, from, his, manager, thiery, after, discovering, that, the, latter, had, been, siphoning, off, money, for, himself, many, belgians, were, highly, critical, of, the, magazine, due, to, its, connections, with, herg, who, was, still, deemed, a, collaborator, and, traitor, by, many, la, soir, and, la, cit, publicly, criticised, the, decision, without, referring, to, him, by, name, while, le, quotidien, and, le, drapeau, rouge, specifically, singled, him, out, for, denunciation, herg, believed, that, the, children, s, author, jeanne, cappe, was, behind, many, of, these, accusations, and, threatened, her, with, a, lawsuit, unhappy, with, life, in, belgium, herg, made, plans, to, emigrate, to, argentina, a, nation, that, was, welcoming, many, europeans, who, had, supported, the, defeated, axis, powers, and, which, had, a, thriving, comic, book, scene, ultimately, he, changed, his, mind, for, reasons, that, have, remained, unknown, it, is, possible, that, he, was, unable, to, secure, any, promise, of, work, in, the, south, american, country, i, ve, just, discovered, that, tintin, is, no, longer, me, and, that, though, he, continued, to, live, it, is, through, a, sort, of, artificial, respiration, that, i, must, keep, up, constantly, and, that, is, exhausting, me, more, and, more, herg, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, 1947, in, may, herg, and, germaine, holidayed, near, to, gland, on, lake, geneva, switzerland, where, they, were, accompanied, by, a, friend, of, theirs, a, young, woman, named, rosane, during, the, holiday, herg, and, rosane, embarked, on, an, extra, marital, affair, he, felt, guilty, and, returned, to, brussels, in, june, privately, he, expressed, the, view, that, he, had, been, led, to, commit, such, an, act, which, he, viewed, as, immoral, through, the, influence, of, amoral, friends, with, whom, he, was, associating, hoping, to, reignite, the, passion, and, stability, of, his, marriage, he, arranged, to, return, to, switzerland, with, germaine, soon, after, here, they, argued, and, embarked, on, a, temporary, separation, remaining, in, switzerland, he, visited, king, leopold, iii, who, was, then, holidaying, in, pr, gny, before, briefly, returning, to, brussels, in, july, back, in, switzerland, he, embarked, on, an, affair, with, a, married, woman, although, again, informed, germaine, before, setting, off, to, spend, time, in, the, ardennes, in, august, the, couple, sought, to, reunite, by, holidaying, together, in, brittany, but, there, they, broke, up, again, and, herg, returned, to, his, lover, in, switzerland, in, september, he, finally, returned, to, brussels, but, he, then, spent, time, with, his, close, friend, marcel, dehaye, in, a, retreat, at, the, abbey, of, notre, dame, de, scourmont, that, month, he, revived, land, of, black, gold, the, adventure, of, tintin, that, had, been, interrupted, by, the, german, invasion, of, 1940, and, began, serialising, it, in, tintin, magazine, however, the, story, was, again, interrupted, this, time, for, 12, weeks, as, herg, took, a, further, unannounced, holiday, to, gland, greatly, annoying, many, of, his, colleagues, although, they, retained, respect, for, each, other, herg, s, repeated, absences, had, created, a, tense, situation, between, himself, and, leblanc, after, a, lengthy, search, leblanc, had, found, a, publisher, willing, to, produce, an, edition, of, tintin, magazine, in, france, georges, dargaud, s, le, lombard, which, began, production, of, a, french, edition, in, october, 1948, however, herg, was, unhappy, that, leblanc, had, appointed, andr, frenez, as, van, melkebeke, s, replacement, as, editor, in, chief, describing, frenez, as, a, cold, functionary, herg, was, stubborn, and, uncompromising, as, the, magazine, s, artistic, director, known, for, strongly, criticising, the, work, of, old, friends, like, pierre, ickx, if, he, felt, that, they, did, not, meet, his, exacting, standards, he, was, particularly, critical, of, the, work, of, two, of, the, newly, hired, staff, at, tintin, and, kuifje, jacques, martin, and, willy, vandersteen, encouraging, them, to, change, their, artistic, style, to, better, reflect, his, own, preferences, to, leblanc, he, expressed, the, concern, that, most, of, those, working, at, tintin, were, better, illustrators, than, storytellers, he, also, opined, that, tintin, was, not, keeping, up, with, the, times, and, what, he, perceived, as, the, increased, maturity, of, children, encouraging, the, magazine, to, better, reflect, current, events, and, scientific, developments, on, 6, april, 1950, herg, established, studios, herg, as, a, public, company, the, studios, were, based, in, his, avenue, delleur, house, in, brussels, with, herg, making, a, newly, purchased, country, house, in, c, roux, mousty, his, and, germaine, s, main, residence, the, studios, would, provide, both, personal, support, to, herg, and, technical, support, for, his, ongoing, work, the, studio, initially, had, only, three, employees, the, staff, would, increase, to, 15, all, of, whom, were, working, on, herg, s, projects, he, hired, bob, de, moor, as, his, primary, apprentice, at, the, studios, in, march, 1951, impressed, by, jacques, martin, s, work, on, the, golden, sphinx, herg, persuaded, martin, to, join, the, studios, in, january, 1954, martin, insisted, on, bringing, with, him, his, own, two, assistants, roger, leloup, and, michel, demarets, during, the, early, 1950s, a, number, of, those, convicted, for, collaborating, with, the, nazi, occupiers, were, freed, from, prison, sympathetic, to, their, plight, herg, lent, money, to, some, and, aided, others, in, getting, jobs, at, tintin, magazine, much, to, leblanc, s, annoyance, for, instance, as, well, as, lending, him, money, herg, used, his, connections, to, secure, raymond, de, becker, a, job, in, switzerland, as, a, book, shop, sales, inspector, he, also, hired, those, associated, with, collaboration, for, his, studios, his, new, colourist, josette, baujot, was, the, wife, of, a, recently, assassinated, member, of, the, walloon, legion, and, his, new, secretary, baudouin, van, der, branden, de, reeth, had, served, a, prison, sentence, for, working, at, le, nouveau, journal, during, the, occupation, herg, had, developed, the, idea, of, setting, an, adventure, of, tintin, on, the, moon, while, producing, prisoners, of, the, sun, he, began, serialisation, of, destination, moon, the, first, of, a, two, part, arc, followed, by, explorers, on, the, moon, in, tintin, magazine, in, march, 1950, in, september, 1950, herg, broke, off, the, story, feeling, the, need, for, a, break, from, work, having, fallen, back, into, clinical, depression, he, and, germaine, went, on, holiday, to, gland, before, returning, to, brussels, in, late, september, many, readers, sent, letters, to, tintin, asking, why, explorers, on, the, moon, was, no, longer, being, serialised, with, a, rumour, emerging, that, herg, had, died, explorers, of, the, moon, would, resume, after, an, eighteen, month, hiatus, returning, in, april, 1952, alongside, his, work, on, the, new, stories, herg, also, made, use, of, the, studios, in, revising, more, of, his, early, works, in, february, 1952, herg, was, involved, in, a, car, crash, in, which, germaine, s, leg, was, shattered, she, had, to, have, a, steel, rod, implanted, in, it, and, was, confined, to, a, wheelchair, for, several, months, their, relationship, was, further, strained, when, they, received, news, of, wallez, death, in, september, 1952, his, friendship, with, van, melkebeke, also, broke, apart, in, this, period, in, part, due, to, advice, gained, from, an, alleged, clairvoyant, bertje, janueneau, upon, whom, both, herg, and, germaine, were, increasingly, relying, for, guidance, in, january, 1955, a, young, woman, named, fanny, vlamynck, fr, was, hired, as, a, colourist, at, the, studios, herg, embarked, on, an, extramarital, affair, with, her, in, november, 1956, with, the, rest, of, the, studio, staff, soon, finding, out, germaine, grew, suspicious, of, her, husband, s, affections, for, fanny, but, was, also, experiencing, a, strong, romantic, attraction, to, her, ballroom, dance, partner, herg, and, germaine, went, on, a, cruise, for, the, former, s, 50th, birthday, in, may, 1957, during, which, they, visited, casablanca, rabat, palermo, and, rome, they, went, on, a, second, holiday, to, ostend, in, october, following, the, trip, to, ostend,

years, later, in, september, 1958, tintin, magazine, moved, its, headquarters, to, a, newly, constructed, building, near, the, gare, du, midi, herg, continued, to, feud, with, leblanc, over, the,

although, herg, soon, departed, to, sardinia, for, six, weeks, in, october, 1965, leblanc, appointed, the, cartoonist, greg, to, be, editor, in, chief, of, the, magazine, believing, him, capable, of, reforming, the, paper, to, remain, relevant, to, the, youth, of, the, day, by, this, point, tintin, magazine, was, at, its, commercial, peak, with, sales, of, 600, 000, a, week, although, herg, had, lost, much, of, his, interest, in, it, supported, by, his, studio, herg, produced, the, calculus, affair, in, 1954, 1956, and, the, red, sea, sharks, in, 1956, 1957, herg, s, book, sales, were,

radio, adaptations, of, the, adventures, of, tintin, were, produced, as, was, an, animated, cartoon, series, produced, by, belvision, studios, herg, s, adventures, of, tintin, two, live, action, films, were, also, produced, tintin, and, the, golden, fleece, 1961, and, tintin, and, the, blue, oranges, 1964, the, former, of, which, herg, had, been, closely, involved, with, developing, an, interest, in, modern, art, in, the, early, 1960s, herg, befriended, the, art, dealer, marcel, stal, owner, of, the, carrefour, gallery, in, brussels, he, was, a, particular, fan, of, the, work, of, constant, permeke, jakob, smits, lucio, fontana, and, jean, pierre, raynaurd, as, well, as, the, pop, art, movement, in, particular, the, work, of, roy, lichtenstein, he, built, up, his, own, personal, collection, which, consisted, of, both, modern, paintings, as, well, as, african, art, and, chinese, ceramics, in, 1962, herg, decided, he, wanted, to, paint, he, chose, louis, van, lint, one, of, the, most, respected, belgian, abstract, painters, at, the, time, whose, work, he, liked, a, lot, to, be, his, private, teacher, herg, took, up, painting, as, a, hobby, producing, abstract, art, works, which, were, influenced, by, the, styles, of, joan, mir, and, serge, poliakoff, he, showed, his, work, to, the, art, historian, l, o, van, puyvelde, who, was, the, chief, conservator, of, the, mus, es, des, beaux, arts, who, believed, that, they, showed, promise, but, that, herg, s, real, talent, lay, with, cartooning, herg, abandoned, painting, shortly, after, having, produced, 37, paintings, in, all, spending, less, time, on, new, adventures, of, tintin, from, june, to, december, 1965, tintin, magazine, serialised, a, redrawn, and, newly, coloured, version, of, the, black, island, prepared, by, staff, at, studios, herg, in, the, 1960s, herg, became, increasingly, annoyed, at, the, success, of, ren, goscinny, and, albert, uderzo, s, asterix, comic, book, series, which, various, commentators, had, described, as, eclipsing, the, adventures, of, tintin, as, the, foremost, comic, in, the, franco, belgian, tradition, hoping, to, imitate, the, success, of, the, recent, animated, films, asterix, the, gaul, 1967, and, asterix, and, cleopatra, 1968, herg, agreed, to, the, production, of, two, animated, belvision, films, based, on, the, adventures, of, tintin, the, first, tintin, and, the, temple, of, the, sun, 1969, was, based, on, pre, existing, comics, whereas, the, second, tintin, and, the, lake, of, sharks, 1972, was, an, original, story, written, by, greg, in, 1982, the, us, filmmaker, steven, spielberg, requested, the, film, rights, for, a, live, action, adaptation, of, one, of, the, adventures, of, tintin, a, prospect, that, excited, herg, but, the, project, never, came, to, fruition, at, the, time, in, a, wide, ranging, interview, with, the, journalist, numa, sadoul, in, october, 1971, herg, opened, up, about, many, of, the, problems, he, had, experienced, in, his, personal, life, sadoul, planned, to, publish, the, interview, as, a, book, but, herg, made, many, alterations, to, the, transcript, both, to, improve, its, prose, and, to, remove, sections, which, cast, him, in, a, negative, light, editors, at, casterman, then, removed, even, further, sections, particularly, those, in, which, herg, expressed, a, negative, view, of, catholicism, the, interview, was, published, as, tintin, et, moi, tintin, and, me, in, 1975, herg, followed, this, by, agreeing, to, be, the, subject, of, a, documentary, film, produced, by, henri, roane, moi, tintin, i, tintin, which, premiered, in, 1975, in, january, 1977, he, attended, an, early, comic, book, convention, at, angoul, me, where, he, was, widely, heralded, as, one, of, the, masters, of, the, discipline, to, mark, the, fiftieth, anniversary, of, the, adventures, of, tintin, in, 1979, a, celebratory, event, was, held, at, brussels, hilton, hotel, while, an, exhibit, on,

regain, contact, with, his, old, friend, zhang, chongren, with, whom, he, had, lost, contact, he, regularly, asked, any, chinese, people, that, he, met, if, they, knew, of, zhang, and, in, 1979, had, some, success, when, a, staff, member, in, a, brussels, chinese, restaurant, revealed, that, he, was, zhang, s, godson, herg, was, thus, able, to, re, establish, contact, with, his, old, friend, the, journalist, g, rard, valet, organised, for, zhang, to, visit, brussels, so, that, he, and, herg, could, be, re, united, the, event, took, place, in, march, 1981, and, was, heavily, publicised, herg, however, found, the, situation, difficult, disliking, the, press, attention, and, finding, that, he, and, zhang, had, grown, distant, during, the, intervening, years, in, june, 1970, herg, s, father,

private, person, being, described, by, biographer, harry, thompson, as, reserved, unostentatious, according, to, his, biographer, pierre, sterckx, herg, appeared, very, conventional, in, public, but, in, reality, was, extremely, erudite, with, an, insatiable, curiosity, constantly, on, the, watch, he, greatly, enjoyed, walking, in, the, countryside, gardening, and, art, collecting, and, he, was, a, fan, of, jazz, music, although, he, disliked, making, public, or, press, appearances, herg, insisted, on, personally, responding, to, all, fan, mail, received, which, took, up, a, considerable, part, of, his, time, he, stated, that, not, replying, to, children, s, letters, would, be, to, betray, their, dreams, friends, described, him, as, a, humorous, man, known, particularly, for, his, self, deprecating, jokes, colleagues, described, herg, as, egocentric, an, assessment, he, agreed, with, he, was, known, to, be, authoritarian, in, dealing, with, his, assistants, and, refused, to, share, credit, with, them, for, their, part, in, his, work, sterckx, noted, that, on, the, one, hand, he, could, be, distant, even, frosty, but, on, the, other, he, was, affectionate, throughout, his, first, marriage, he, had, a, number, of, affairs, with, other, women, he, had, no, children, having, been, rendered, sterile, by, radiation, treatment, but, in, the, 1950s, offered, to, adopt, his, brother, paul, s, two, children, denise, and, george, when, their, parents, were, experiencing, trouble, in, their, relationship, paul, declined, the, offer, with, denise, and, george, later, noting, that, they, had, no, great, affection, for, their, uncle, deeming, him, awkward, around, children, herg, was, raised, as, a, catholic, although, he, was, never, a, devout, practitioner, of, the, religion, his, adherence, to, catholicism, declined, in, later, life, as, he, developed, a, keen, interest, in, taoism, and, became, an, agnostic, he, was, a, fan, of, the, tao, te, ching, and, arnaud, desjardins, the, path, to, wisdom, as, well, as, fritjof, capra, s, the, tao, of, physics, and, the, work, of, jean, mile, charon, politically, herg, was, a, fervent, royalist, and, remained, so, throughout, his, life, also, believing, in, the, unity, of, belgium, in, his, early, life, herg, was, close, to, the, traditional, right, wing, of, belgian, society, with, sterckx, noting, that, through, his, work, he, was, plunged, into, rightist, even, extreme, right, wing, circles, according, to, harry, thompson, such, political, ideas, were, not, unusual, in, middle, class, circles, in, belgium, of, the, 1920s, and, early, 1930s, where, patriotism, catholicism, strict, morality, discipline, and, naivety, were, so, inextricably, bound, together, in, everyone, s, lives, that, right, wing, politics, were, an, almost, inevitable, by, product, it, was, a, world, view, shared, by, everyone, distinguished, principally, by, its, complete, ignorance, of, the, world, when, herg, took, responsibility, for, le, petit, vingti, me, he, followed, wallez, s, instruction, and, allowed, the, newspaper, to, contain, explicitly, pro, fascist, and, anti, semitic, sentiment, literary, critic, jean, marie, apostolid, s, noted, that, the, character, of, tintin, was, a, personification, of, the, new, youth, concept, which, was, promoted, by, the, european, far, right, under, wallez, s, guidance, the, early, adventures, of, tintin, contained, explicit, political, messages, for, its, young, readership, tintin, in, the, land, of, the, soviets, was, a, work, of, anti, socialist, propaganda, while, tintin, in, the, congo, was, designed, to, encourage, colonialist, sentiment, toward, the, belgian, congo, and, tintin, in, america, was, designed, as, a, work, of, anti, americanism, heavily, critical, of, capitalism, commercialism, and, industrialisation, in, contrast, to, herg, s, involvement, in, belgium, s, right, wing, sterckx, thought, the, cartoonist, to, have, been, a, liberal, and, independent, spirit, someone, who, was, the, very, opposite, of, a, conservative, a, reactionary, of, the, right, michael, farr, asserted, that, herg, had, an, acute, political, conscience, during, his, earlier, days, as, exemplified, by, his, condemnation, of, racism, in, the, united, states, evident, in, tintin, in, america, literary, critic, tom, mccarthy, went, further, remarking, that, tintin, in, america, represented, the, emergence, of, a, left, wing, counter, tendency, in, herg, s, work, that, rebelled, against, his, right, wing, milieu, and, which, was, particularly, critical, of, wealthy, capitalists, and, industrialists, this, was, furthered, in, the, blue, lotus, in, which, herg, rejected, his, classically, right, wing, ideas, to, embrace, an, anti, imperialist, stance, and, in, a, contemporary, quick, flupke, strip, in, which, he, lampooned, the, far, right, leaders, of, germany, and, italy, adolf, hitler, and, benito, mussolini, although, many, of, his, friends, and, colleagues, did, so, in, the, mid, 1930s, herg, did, not, join, the, far, right, rexist, party, later, asserting, that, he, had, always, had, an, aversion, to, it, and, commenting, that, to, throw, my, heart, and, soul, into, an, ideology, is, the, opposite, of, who, i, am, herg, faced, repeated, accusations, of, racism, due, to, his, portrayal, of, diverse, ethnic, groups, throughout, the, adventures, of, tintin, according, to, mccarthy, in, tintin, in, the, congo, herg, represented, the, congolese, as, good, at, heart, but, backwards, and, lazy, in, need, of, european, mastery, thompson, argued, that, herg, had, not, written, the, book, to, be, deliberately, racist, and, that, it, reflected, the, average, early, 20th, century, belgian, view, of, the, congolese, which, was, more, patronising, than, malevolent, the, book, provoked, no, controversy, at, the, time, coming, to, be, perceived, as, racist, only, in, the, latter, half, of, the, 20th, century, in, the, following, adventure, tintin, in, america, herg, depicted, members, of, the, blackfoot, tribe, of, native, americans, as, gullible, even, naive, though, it, was, nevertheless, broadly, sympathetic, to, their, culture, and, plight, depicting, their, oppression, at, the, hands, of, the, united, states, army, the, blue, lotus, received, both, criticism, for, depicting, the, japanese, as, militaristic, and, buck, toothed, and, praise, for, representing, a, less, stereotypical, vision, of, china, than, was, the, norm, in, europe, at, the, time, herg, has, also, been, accused, of, utilising, anti, semitic, stereotypes, despite, herg, s, protestations, that, the, character, of, rastapopoulos, was, greek, and, not, jewish, from, his, early, years, herg, was, openly, critical, of, racism, he, lambasted, the, pervasive, racism, of, u, s, society, in, a, prelude, comment, to, tintin, in, america, published, in, le, petit, vingti, me, on, 20, august, 1931, and, ridiculed, racist, attitudes, toward, the, chinese, in, the, blue, lotus, peeters, asserted, that, herg, was, no, more, racist, than, the, next, man, an, assessment, shared, by, farr, who, after, meeting, herg, in, the, 1980s, commented, that, you, couldn, t, have, met, someone, who, was, more, open, and, less, racist, in, contrast, laurence, grove, president, of, the, international, bande, dessin, e, society, opined, that, herg, adhered, to, prevailing, societal, trends, in, his, work, noting, when, it, was, fashionable, to, be, a, nazi, he, was, a, nazi, when, it, was, fashionable, to, be, a, colonial, racist, that, s, what, he, was, discussing, tintin, s, racist, elements, the, vietnamese, american, novelist, viet, thanh, nguyen, observed, that, herg, s, work, is, deeply, flawed, and, yet, riveting, narratively, and, aesthetically, i, have, forgotten, all, the, well, intentioned, moralistic, children, s, literature, that, i, have, read, but, i, haven, t, forgotten, herg, assouline, described, herg, as, the, personification, of, belgium, according, to, the, unesco, s, index, translationum, herg, is, the, ninth, most, often, translated, french, language, author, the, second, most, often, translated, belgian, author, after, georges, simenon, and, the, second, most, often, translated, french, language, comics, author, behind, ren, goscinny, he, also, had, an, asteroid, 1652, herg, within, the, main, belt, named, after, him, in, 1953, a, cartoon, version, of, herg, makes, a, number, of, cameo, appearances, in, the, 1990s, animated, television, series, the, adventures, of, tintin, an, animated, version, of, herg, also, makes, a, cameo, appearance, at, the, start, of, the, 2011, motion, capture, film, the, adventures, of, tintin, the, secret, of, the, unicorn, directed, by, steven, spielberg, and, produced, by, peter, jackson, where, he, is, depicted, as, a, street, cartoonist, drawing, a, portrait, of, tintin, in, the, style, of, the, comic, at, the, start, of, the, film, the, mus, e, herg, is, located, in, the, centre, of, louvain, la, neuve, a, city, to, the, south, of, brussels, this, location, was, originally, chosen, for, the, museum,

of, herg, 22, may, 2007, the, museum, s, first, stone, was, laid, the, museum, opened, its, doors, in, june, 2009, the, idea, of, a, museum, dedicated, to, the, work, of, herg, can, be, traced, back, to, the, end, of, the, 1970s, when, herg, was, still, alive, after, his, death, in, 1983, herg, s, widow, fanny, led, the, efforts, undertaken, at, first, by, the, herg, foundation, and, then, by, the, new, studios, herg, to, catalogue, and, choose, the, artwork, and, elements, that, would, become, part, of, the, museum, s, exhibitions, the, herg, museum, contains, eight, permanent, galleries,
