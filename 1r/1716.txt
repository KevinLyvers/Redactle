santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, spanish, 1, may, 1852, 17, october, 1934, was, a, spanish, neuroscientist, pathologist, and, histologist, specializing, in, neuroanatomy, and, the, central, nervous, system, he, and, camillo, golgi, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1906, ram, n, y, cajal, was, the, first, person, of, spanish, origin, to, win, a, scientific, nobel, prize, his, original, investigations, of, the, microscopic, structure, of, the, brain, made, him, a, pioneer, of, modern, neuroscience, hundreds, of, his, drawings, illustrating, the, arborizations, tree, growing, of, brain, cells, are, still, in, use, since, the, mid, 20th, century, for, educational, and, training, purposes, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, was, born, on, the, 1st, of, may, 1852, in, the, town, of, petilla, de, arag, n, navarre, spain, as, a, child, he, was, transferred, many, times, from, one, school, to, another, because, of, behavior, that, was, declared, poor, rebellious, and, showing, an, anti, authoritarian, attitude, an, extreme, example, of, his, precociousness, and, rebelliousness, at, the, age, of, eleven, is, his, 1863, imprisonment, for, destroying, his, neighbor, s, yard, gate, with, a, homemade, cannon, he, was, a, keen, painter, artist, and, gymnast, but, his, father, neither, appreciated, nor, encouraged, these, abilities, even, though, these, artistic, talents, would, contribute, to, his, success, later, in, life, his, father, apprenticed, him, to, a, shoemaker, and, barber, to, try, and, give, his, son, much, needed, discipline, and, stability, over, the, summer, of, 1868, his, father, took, him, to, graveyards, to, find, human, remains, for, anatomical, study, early, sketches, of, bones, moved, him, to, pursue, medical, studies, 207, ram, n, y, cajal, attended, the, medical, school, of, the, university, of, zaragoza, where, his, father, worked, as, an, anatomy, teacher, he, graduated, in, 1873, aged, 21, and, then, served, as, a, medical, officer, in, the, spanish, army, he, took, part, in, an, expedition, to, cuba, in, 1874, 1875, where, he, contracted, malaria, and, tuberculosis, to, aid, his, recovery, ram, n, y, cajal, spent, time, in, the, spa, town, panticosa, in, the, pyrenees, mountain, range, after, returning, to, spain, he, received, his, doctorate, in, medicine, in, madrid, in, 1877, two, years, later, he, became, director, of, the, anatomical, museum, at, the, university, of, zaragoza, and, married, silveria, fa, an, s, garc, a, with, whom, he, would, have, seven, daughters, and, five, sons, ram, n, y, cajal, worked, at, the, university, of, zaragoza, until, 1883, when, he, was, awarded, the, position, of, anatomy, professor, of, the, university, of, valencia, his, early, work, at, these, two, universities, focused, on, the, pathology, of, inflammation, the, microbiology, of, cholera, and, the, structure, of, epithelial, cells, and, tissues, in, 1887, ram, n, y, cajal, moved, to, barcelona, for, a, professorship, there, he, first, learned, about, golgi, s, method, a, cell, staining, method, which, uses, potassium, dichromate, and, silver, nitrate, to, randomly, stain, a, few, neurons, a, dark, black, color, while, leaving, the, surrounding, cells, transparent, this, method, which, he, improved, was, central, to, his, work, allowing, him, to, turn, his, attention, to, the, central, nervous, system, brain, and, spinal, cord, in, which, neurons, are, so, densely, intertwined, that, standard, microscopic, inspection, would, be, nearly, impossible, during, this, period, he, made, extensive, detailed, drawings, of, neural, material, covering, many, species, and, most, major, regions, of, the, brain, in, 1892, he, became, professor, at, madrid, in, 1899, he, became, director, of, the, instituto, nacional, de, higiene, translated, as, national, institute, of, hygiene, and, in, 1922, founder, of, the, laboratorio, de, investigaciones, biol, gicas, translated, as, laboratory, of, biological, investigations, later, renamed, to, instituto, cajal, or, cajal, institute, he, died, in, madrid, on, october, 17, 1934, at, the, age, of, 82, continuing, to, work, even, on, his, deathbed, in, 1877, the, 25, year, old, ram, n, y, cajal, joined, a, masonic, lodge, 156, john, brande, trend, wrote, in, 1965, that, ram, n, y, cajal, was, a, liberal, in, politics, an, evolutionist, in, philosophy, an, agnostic, in, religion, nonetheless, ram, n, y, cajal, used, the, term, soul, without, any, shame, he, was, said, to, later, have, regretted, having, left, organized, religion, 343, ultimately, he, became, convinced, of, a, belief, in, god, as, a, creator, as, stated, during, his, first, lecture, before, the, spanish, royal, academy, of, sciences, ram, n, y, cajal, made, several, major, contributions, to, neuroanatomy, he, discovered, the, axonal, growth, cone, and, demonstrated, experimentally, that, the, relationship, between, nerve, cells, was, not, continuous, or, a, single, system, as, per, then, extant, reticular, theory, but, rather, contiguous, there, were, gaps, between, neurons, this, provided, definitive, evidence, for, what, heinrich, waldeyer, would, name, neuron, theory, now, widely, considered, the, foundation, of, modern, neuroscience, he, is, also, considered, by, some, to, be, the, first, neuroscientist, since, in, 1894, he, stated, to, the, royal, society, of, london, the, ability, of, neurons, to, grow, in, an, adult, and, their, power, to, create, new, connections, can, explain, learning, this, statement, is, considered, to, be, the, origin, of, the, synaptic, theory, of, memory, he, was, an, advocate, of, the, existence, of, dendritic, spines, although, he, did, not, recognize, them, as, the, site, of, contact, from, presynaptic, cells, he, was, a, proponent, of, polarization, of, nerve, cell, function, and, his, student, rafael, lorente, de, n, would, continue, this, study, of, input, output, systems, into, cable, theory, and, some, of, the, earliest, circuit, analysis, of, neural, structures, by, producing, depictions, of, neural, structures, and, their, connectivity, and, providing, detailed, descriptions, of, cell, types, he, discovered, a, new, type, of, cell, which, was, subsequently, named, after, him, the, interstitial, cell, of, cajal, icc, this, cell, is, found, interleaved, among, neurons, embedded, within, the, smooth, muscles, lining, the, gut, serving, as, the, generator, and, pacemaker, of, the, slow, waves, of, contraction, which, move, material, along, the, gastrointestinal, tract, mediating, neurotransmission, from, motor, neurons, to, smooth, muscle, cells, in, his, 1894, croonian, lecture, ram, n, y, cajal, suggested, in, an, extended, metaphor, that, cortical, pyramidal, cells, may, become, more, elaborate, with, time, as, a, tree, grows, and, extends, its, branches, he, studied, some, psychological, phenomena, such, as, hypnotic, suggestion, to, alleviate, pain, which, he, used, to, help, his, wife, during, labor, a, book, he, had, written, on, these, topics, was, lost, during, the, spanish, civil, war, during, his, studies, on, the, optic, chiasma, cajal, developed, a, visual, map, based, theory, offering, an, evolutionary, explanation, for, the, decussation, of, nerve, fibres, and, the, chiasm, of, the, optic, tract, ram, n, y, cajal, received, many, prizes, distinctions, and, societal, memberships, during, his, scientific, career, including, honorary, doctorates, in, medicine, from, cambridge, university, and, w, rzburg, university, and, an, honorary, doctorate, in, philosophy, from, clark, university, the, most, famous, distinction, he, was, awarded, was, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, in, 1906, together, with, the, italian, scientist, camillo, golgi, in, recognition, of, their, work, on, the, structure, of, the, nervous, system, this, caused, some, controversy, because, golgi, a, staunch, supporter, of, reticular, theory, disagreed, with, ram, n, y, cajal, in, his, view, of, the, neuron, doctrine, before, ram, n, y, cajal, s, work, norwegian, scientist, fridtjof, nansen, had, established, the, contiguous, nature, of, nerve, cells, in, his, study, of, certain, marine, life, which, ram, n, y, cajal, failed, to, cite, ram, n, y, cajal, was, an, international, member, of, both, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, and, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1906, joaquin, sorolla, y, bastida, painted, cajal, s, official, portrait, celebrating, his, nobel, prize, win, cajal, posed, for, a, statue, that, was, created, by, the, sculptor, mariano, benlliure, and, was, installed, in, 1924, in, the, paraninfo, building, at, the, school, of, medicine, of, the, university, of, zaragoza, in, 1931, a, monument, was, unveiled, in, madrid, spain, this, full, body, statue, stands, 3, meters, around, 10, ft, high, on, a, narrow, pedestal, and, was, created, by,
