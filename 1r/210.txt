of, the, genre, begins, with, his, work, and, understanding, of, earlier, greek, tragedy, is, largely, based, on, inferences, made, from, reading, his, surviving, plays, according, to, aristotle, he, expanded, the, number, of, characters, in, the, theatre, and, allowed, conflict, among, them, formerly, characters, interacted, only, with, the, chorus, only, seven, of, aeschylus, s, estimated, 70, to, 90, plays, have, survived, there, is, a, long, standing, debate, regarding, the, authorship, of, one, of, them, prometheus, bound, with, some, scholars, arguing, that, it, may, be, the, work, of, his, son, euphorion, fragments, from, other, plays, have, survived, in, quotations, and, more, continue, to, be, discovered, on, egyptian, papyri, these, fragments, often, give, further, insights, into, aeschylus, work, he, was, likely, the, first, dramatist, to, present, plays, as, a, trilogy, his, oresteia, is, the, only, extant, ancient, example, at, least, one, of, his, plays, was, influenced, by, the, persians, second, invasion, of, greece, 480, 479, bc, this, work, the, persians, is, one, of, very, few, classical, greek, tragedies, concerned, with, contemporary, events, and, the, only, one, extant, the, significance, of, the, war, with, persia, was, so, great, to, aeschylus, and, the, greeks, that, his, epitaph, commemorates, his, participation, in, the, greek, victory, at, marathon, while, making, no, mention, of, his, success, as, a, playwright, aeschylus, was, born, around, 525, bc, in, eleusis, a, small, town, about, 27, kilometres, 17, mi, northwest, of, athens, in, the, fertile, valleys, of, western, attica, some, scholars, argue, that, the, date, of, aeschylus, s, birth, may, be, based, on, counting, back, 40, years, from, his, first, victory, in, the, great, dionysia, his, family, was, wealthy, and, well, established, his, father, euphorion, was, said, to, be, a, member, of, the, eupatridae, the, ancient, nobility, of, attica, but, this, might, be, a, fiction, invented, by, the, ancients, to, account, for, the, grandeur, of, aeschylus, plays, as, a, youth, aeschylus, worked, at, a, vineyard, until, according, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, geographer, pausanias, the, god, dionysus, visited, him, in, his, sleep, and, commanded, him, to, turn, his, attention, to, the, nascent, art, of, tragedy, as, soon, as, he, woke, he, began, to, write, a, tragedy, and, his, first, performance, took, place, in, 499, bc, when, he, was, 26, years, old, he, won, his, first, victory, at, the, dionysia, in, 484, bc, in, 510, bc, when, aeschylus, was, 15, years, old, cleomenes, i, expelled, the, sons, of, peisistratus, from, athens, and, cleisthenes, came, to, power, cleisthenes, reforms, included, a, system, of, registration, that, emphasized, the, importance, of, the, deme, over, family, tradition, in, the, last, decade, of, the, 6th, century, aeschylus, and, his, family, were, living, in, the, deme, of, eleusis, the, persian, wars, played, a, large, role, in, aeschylus, life, and, career, in, 490, bc, he, and, his, brother, cynegeirus, fought, to, defend, athens, against, the, invading, army, of, darius, i, of, persia, at, the, battle, of, marathon, the, athenians, emerged, triumphant, and, the, victory, was, celebrated, across, the, city, states, of, greece, cynegeirus, was, killed, while, trying, to, prevent, a, persian, ship, retreating, from, the, shore, for, which, his, countrymen, extolled, him, as, a, hero, in, 480, bc, aeschylus, was, called, into, military, service, again, together, with, his, younger, brother, ameinias, against, xerxes, i, s, invading, forces, at, the, battle, of, salamis, aeschylus, also, fought, at, the, battle, of, plataea, in, 479, bc, ion, of, chios, was, a, witness, for, aeschylus, war, record, and, his, contribution, in, salamis, salamis, holds, a, prominent, place, in, the, persians, his, oldest, surviving, play, which, was, performed, in, 472, bc, and, won, first, prize, at, the, dionysia, aeschylus, was, one, of, many, greeks, who, were, initiated, into, the, eleusinian, mysteries, an, ancient, cult, of, demeter, based, in, his, home, town, of, eleusis, according, to, aristotle, aeschylus, was, accused, of, asebeia, impiety, for, revealing, some, of, the, cult, s, secrets, on, stage, other, sources, claim, that, an, angry, mob, tried, to, kill, aeschylus, on, the, spot, but, he, fled, the, scene, heracleides, of, pontus, asserts, that, the, audience, tried, to, stone, aeschylus, aeschylus, took, refuge, at, the, altar, in, the, orchestra, of, the, theater, of, dionysus, he, pleaded, ignorance, at, his, trial, he, was, acquitted, with, the, jury, sympathetic, to, the, military, service, of, him, and, his, brothers, during, the, persian, wars, according, to, the, 2nd, century, ad, author, aelian, aeschylus, younger, brother, ameinias, helped, to, acquit, aeschylus, by, showing, the, jury, the, stump, of, the, hand, he, had, lost, at, salamis, where, he, was, voted, bravest, warrior, the, truth, is, that, the, award, for, bravery, at, salamis, went, not, to, aeschylus, brother, but, to, ameinias, of, pallene, aeschylus, travelled, to, sicily, once, or, twice, in, the, 470s, bc, having, been, invited, by, hiero, i, tyrant, of, syracuse, a, major, greek, city, on, the, eastern, side, of, the, island, he, produced, the, women, of, aetna, during, one, of, these, trips, in, honor, of, the, city, founded, by, hieron, and, restaged, his, persians, by, 473, bc, after, the, death, of, phrynichus, one, of, his, chief, rivals, aeschylus, was, the, yearly, favorite, in, the, dionysia, winning, first, prize, in, nearly, every, competition, in, 472, bc, aeschylus, staged, the, production, that, included, the, persians, with, pericles, serving, as, choregos, aeschylus, married, and, had, two, sons, euphorion, and, euaeon, both, of, whom, became, tragic, poets, euphorion, won, first, prize, in, 431, bc, in, competition, against, both, sophocles, and, euripides, a, nephew, of, aeschylus, philocles, his, sister, s, son, was, also, a, tragic, poet, and, won, first, prize, in, the, competition, against, sophocles, oedipus, rex, aeschylus, had, at, least, two, brothers, cynegeirus, and, ameinias, in, 458, bc, aeschylus, returned, to, sicily, for, the, last, time, visiting, the, city, of, gela, where, he, died, in, 456, or, 455, bc, valerius, maximus, wrote, that, he, was, killed, outside, the, city, by, a, tortoise, dropped, by, an, eagle, which, had, mistaken, his, head, for, a, rock, suitable, for, shattering, the, shell, and, killed, him, pliny, in, his, naturalis, histori, adds, that, aeschylus, had, been, staying, outdoors, to, avoid, a, prophecy, that, he, would, be, killed, by, a, falling, object, but, this, story, may, be, legendary, and, due, to, a, misunderstanding, of, the, iconography, on, aeschylus, tomb, aeschylus, work, was, so, respected, by, the, athenians, that, after, his, death, his, tragedies, were, the, only, ones, allowed, to, be, restaged, in, subsequent, competitions, his, sons, euphorion, and, eu, on, and, his, nephew, philocles, also, became, playwrights, the, inscription, on, aeschylus, gravestone, makes, no, mention, of, his, theatrical, renown, commemorating, only, his, military, achievements, beneath, this, stone, lies, aeschylus, son, of, euphorion, the, athenian, who, perished, in, the, wheat, bearing, land, of, gela, of, his, noble, prowess, the, grove, of, marathon, can, speak, and, the, long, haired, persian, knows, it, well, the, seeds, of, greek, drama, were, sown, in, religious, festivals, for, the, gods, chiefly, dionysus, the, god, of, wine, during, aeschylus, lifetime, dramatic, competitions, became, part, of, the, city, dionysia, held, in, spring, the, festival, opened, with, a, procession, which, was, followed, by, a, competition, of, boys, singing, dithyrambs, and, all, culminated, in, a, pair, of, dramatic, competitions, the, first, competition, aeschylus, would, have, participated, in, involved, three, playwrights, each, presenting, three, tragedies, and, one, satyr, play, a, second, competition, involving, five, comedic, playwrights, followed, and, the, winners, of, both, competitions, were, chosen, by, a, panel, of, judges, aeschylus, entered, many, of, these, competitions, and, various, ancient, sources, attribute, between, seventy, and, ninety, plays, to, him, only, seven, tragedies, attributed, to, him, have, survived, intact, the, persians, seven, against, thebes, the, suppliants, the, trilogy, known, as, the, oresteia, the, three, tragedies, agamemnon, the, libation, bearers, and, the, eumenides, and, prometheus, bound, whose, authorship, is, disputed, with, the, exception, of, this, last, play, the, success, of, which, is, uncertain, all, of, aeschylus, s, extant, tragedies, are, known, to, have, won, first, prize, at, the, city, dionysia, the, alexandrian, life, of, aeschylus, claims, that, he, won, the, first, prize, at, the, city, dionysia, thirteen, times, this, compares, favorably, with, sophocles, reported, eighteen, victories, with, a, substantially, larger, catalogue, an, estimated, 120, plays, and, dwarfs, the, five, victories, of, euripides, who, is, thought, to, have, written, roughly, 90, plays, one, hallmark, of, aeschylean, dramaturgy, appears, to, have, been, his, tendency, to, write, connected, trilogies, in, which, each, play, serves, as, a, chapter, in, a, continuous, dramatic, narrative, the, oresteia, is, the, only, extant, example, of, this, type, of, connected, trilogy, but, there, is, evidence, that, aeschylus, often, wrote, such, trilogies, the, satyr, plays, that, followed, his, tragic, trilogies, also, drew, from, myth, the, satyr, play, proteus, which, followed, the, oresteia, treated, the, story, of, menelaus, detour, in, egypt, on, his, way, home, from, the, trojan, war, it, is, assumed, based, on, the, evidence, provided, by, a, catalogue, of, aeschylean, play, titles, scholia, and, play, fragments, recorded, by, later, authors, that, three, other, extant, plays, of, his, were, components, of, connected, trilogies, seven, against, thebes, was, the, final, play, in, an, oedipus, trilogy, and, the, suppliants, and, prometheus, bound, were, each, the, first, play, in, a, danaid, trilogy, and, prometheus, trilogy, respectively, scholars, have, also, suggested, several, completely, lost, trilogies, based, on, known, play, titles, a, number, of, these, treated, myths, about, the, trojan, war, one, collectively, called, the, achilleis, comprised, myrmidons, nereids, and, phrygians, alternately, the, ransoming, of, hector, another, trilogy, apparently, recounted, the, entrance, of, the, trojan, ally, memnon, into, the, war, and, his, death, at, the, hands, of, achilles, memnon, and, the, weighing, of, souls, being, two, components, of, the, trilogy, the, award, of, the, arms, the, phrygian, women, and, the, salaminian, women, suggest, a, trilogy, about, the, madness, and, subsequent, suicide, of, the, greek, hero, ajax, aeschylus, seems, to, have, written, about, odysseus, return, to, ithaca, after, the, war, including, his, killing, of, his, wife, penelope, s, suitors, and, its, consequences, in, a, trilogy, consisting, of, the, soul, raisers, penelope, and, the, bone, gatherers, other, suggested, trilogies, touched, on, the, myth, of, jason, and, the, argonauts, arg, lemnian, women, hypsipyl, the, life, of, perseus, the, net, draggers, polydekt, s, phorkides, the, birth, and, exploits, of, dionysus, semele, bacchae, pentheus, and, the, aftermath, of, the, war, portrayed, in, seven, against, thebes, eleusinians, argives, or, argive, women, sons, of, the, seven, the, persians, persai, is, the, earliest, of, aeschylus, extant, plays, it, was, performed, in, 472, bc, it, was, based, on, aeschylus, own, experiences, specifically, the, battle, of, salamis, it, is, unique, among, surviving, greek, tragedies, in, that, it, describes, a, recent, historical, event, the, persians, focuses, on, the, popular, greek, theme, of, hubris, and, blames, persia, s, loss, on, the, pride, of, its, king, it, opens, with, the, arrival, of, a, messenger, in, susa, the, persian, capital, bearing, news, of, the, catastrophic, persian, defeat, at, salamis, to, atossa, the, mother, of, the, persian, king, xerxes, atossa, then, travels, to, the, tomb, of, darius, her, husband, where, his, ghost, appears, to, explain, the, cause, of, the, defeat, it, is, he, says, the, result, of, xerxes, hubris, in, building, a, bridge, across, the, hellespont, an, action, which, angered, the, gods, xerxes, appears, at, the, end, of, the, play, not, realizing, the, cause, of, his, defeat, and, the, play, closes, to, lamentations, by, xerxes, and, the, chorus, seven, against, thebes, hepta, epi, thebas, was, performed, in, 467, bc, it, has, the, contrasting, theme, of, the, interference, of, the, gods, in, human, affairs, another, theme, with, which, aeschylus, would, continually, involve, himself, makes, its, first, known, appearance, in, this, play, namely, that, the, polis, was, a, key, development, of, human, civilization, the, play, tells, the, story, of, eteocles, and, polynices, the, sons, of, the, shamed, king, of, thebes, oedipus, eteocles, and, polynices, agree, to, share, and, alternate, the, throne, of, the, city, after, the, first, year, eteocles, refuses, to, step, down, polynices, therefore, undertakes, war, the, pair, kill, each, other, in, single, combat, and, the, original, ending, of, the, play, consisted, of, lamentations, for, the, dead, brothers, but, a, new, ending, was, added, to, the, play, some, fifty, years, later, antigone, and, ismene, mourn, their, dead, brothers, a, messenger, enters, announcing, an, edict, prohibiting, the, burial, of, polynices, and, antigone, declares, her, intention, to, defy, this, edict, the, play, was, the, third, in, a, connected, oedipus, trilogy, the, first, two, plays, were, laius, and, oedipus, the, concluding, satyr, play, was, the, sphinx, aeschylus, continued, his, emphasis, on, the, polis, with, the, suppliants, hiketides, in, 463, bc, the, play, gives, tribute, to, the, democratic, undercurrents, which, were, running, through, athens, and, preceding, the, establishment, of, a, democratic, government, in, 461, the, danaids, 50, daughters, of, danaus, founder, of, argos, flee, a, forced, marriage, to, their, cousins, in, egypt, they, turn, to, king, pelasgus, of, argos, for, protection, but, pelasgus, refuses, until, the, people, of, argos, weigh, in, on, the, decision, a, distinctly, democratic, move, on, the, part, of, the, king, the, people, decide, that, the, danaids, deserve, protection, and, are, allowed, within, the, walls, of, argos, despite, egyptian, protests, a, danaid, trilogy, had, long, been, assumed, because, of, the, suppliants, cliffhanger, ending, this, was, confirmed, by, the, 1952, publication, of, oxyrhynchus, papyrus, 2256, fr, 3, the, constituent, plays, are, generally, agreed, to, be, the, suppliants, and, the, egyptians, and, the, danaids, a, plausible, reconstruction, of, the, trilogy, s, last, two, thirds, runs, thus, in, the, egyptians, the, argive, egyptian, war, threatened, in, the, first, play, has, transpired, king, pelasgus, was, killed, during, the, war, and, danaus, rules, argos, danaus, negotiates, a, settlement, with, aegyptus, a, condition, of, which, requires, his, 50, daughters, to, marry, the, 50, sons, of, aegyptus, danaus, secretly, informs, his, daughters, of, an, oracle, which, predicts, that, one, of, his, sons, in, law, would, kill, him, he, orders, the, danaids, to, murder, their, husbands, therefore, on, their, wedding, night, his, daughters, agree, the, danaids, would, open, the, day, after, the, wedding, it, is, revealed, that, 49, of, the, 50, danaids, killed, their, husbands, hypermnestra, did, not, kill, her, husband, lynceus, and, helped, him, escape, danaus, is, angered, by, his, daughter, s, disobedience, and, orders, her, imprisonment, and, possibly, execution, in, the, trilogy, s, climax, and, d, nouement, lynceus, reveals, himself, to, danaus, and, kills, him, thus, fulfilling, the, oracle, he, and, hypermnestra, will, establish, a, ruling, dynasty, in, argos, the, other, 49, danaids, are, absolved, of, their, murders, and, married, off, to, unspecified, argive, men, the, satyr, play, following, this, trilogy, was, titled, amymone, after, one, of, the, danaids, besides, a, few, missing, lines, the, oresteia, of, 458, bc, is, the, only, complete, trilogy, of, greek, plays, by, any, playwright, still, extant, of, proteus, the, satyr, play, which, followed, only, fragments, are, known, agamemnon, and, the, libation, bearers, choephoroi, and, the, eumenides, together, tell, the, violent, story, of, the, family, of, agamemnon, king, of, argos, aeschylus, begins, in, greece, describing, the, return, of, king, agamemnon, from, his, victory, in, the, trojan, war, from, the, perspective, of, the, townspeople, the, chorus, and, his, wife, clytemnestra, dark, foreshadowings, build, to, the, death, of, the, king, at, the, hands, of, his, wife, who, was, angry, that, their, daughter, iphigenia, was, killed, so, that, the, gods, would, restore, the, winds, and, allow, the, greek, fleet, to, sail, to, troy, clytemnestra, was, also, unhappy, that, agamemnon, kept, the, trojan, prophetess, cassandra, as, his, concubine, cassandra, foretells, the, murder, of, agamemnon, and, of, herself, to, the, assembled, townsfolk, who, are, horrified, she, then, enters, the, palace, knowing, that, she, cannot, avoid, her, fate, the, ending, of, the, play, includes, a, prediction, of, the, return, of, orestes, son, of, agamemnon, who, will, seek, to, avenge, his, father, the, libation, bearers, opens, with, orestes, arrival, at, agamemnon, s, tomb, from, exile, in, phocis, electra, meets, orestes, there, they, plan, revenge, against, clytemnestra, and, her, lover, aegisthus, clytemnestra, s, account, of, a, nightmare, in, which, she, gives, birth, to, a, snake, is, recounted, by, the, chorus, this, leads, her, to, order, her, daughter, electra, to, pour, libations, on, agamemnon, s, tomb, with, the, assistance, of, libation, bearers, in, hope, of, making, amends, orestes, enters, the, palace, pretending, to, bear, news, of, his, own, death, clytemnestra, calls, in, aegisthus, to, learn, the, news, orestes, kills, them, both, orestes, is, then, beset, by, the, furies, who, avenge, the, murders, of, kin, in, greek, mythology, the, third, play, addresses, the, question, of, orestes, guilt, the, furies, drive, orestes, from, argos, and, into, the, wilderness, he, makes, his, way, to, the, temple, of, apollo, and, begs, apollo, to, drive, the, furies, away, apollo, had, encouraged, orestes, to, kill, clytemnestra, so, he, bears, some, of, the, guilt, for, the, murder, apollo, sends, orestes, to, the, temple, of, athena, with, hermes, as, a, guide, the, furies, track, him, down, and, athena, steps, in, and, declares, that, a, trial, is, necessary, apollo, argues, orestes, case, and, after, the, judges, including, athena, deliver, a, tie, vote, athena, announces, that, orestes, is, acquitted, she, renames, the, furies, the, eumenides, the, good, spirited, or, kindly, ones, and, extols, the, importance, of, reason, in, the, development, of, laws, as, in, the, suppliants, the, ideals, of, a, democratic, athens, are, praised, prometheus, bound, is, attributed, to, aeschylus, by, ancient, authorities, since, the, late, 19th, century, however, scholars, have, increasingly, doubted, this, ascription, largely, on, stylistic, grounds, its, production, date, is, also, in, dispute, with, theories, ranging, from, the, 480s, bc, to, as, late, as, the, 410s, the, play, consists, mostly, of, static, dialogue, the, titan, prometheus, is, bound, to, a, rock, throughout, which, is, his, punishment, from, the, olympian, zeus, for, providing, fire, to, humans, the, god, hephaestus, and, the, titan, oceanus, and, the, chorus, of, oceanids, all, express, sympathy, for, prometheus, plight, prometheus, is, met, by, io, a, fellow, victim, of, zeus, cruelty, he, prophesies, her, future, travels, revealing, that, one, of, her, descendants, will, free, prometheus, the, play, closes, with, zeus, sending, prometheus, into, the, abyss, because, prometheus, will, not, tell, him, of, a, potential, marriage, which, could, prove, zeus, downfall, prometheus, bound, seems, to, have, been, the, first, play, in, a, trilogy, the, prometheia, in, the, second, play, prometheus, unbound, heracles, frees, prometheus, from, his, chains, and, kills, the, eagle, that, had, been, sent, daily, to, eat, prometheus, perpetually, regenerating, liver, then, believed, the, source, of, feeling, we, learn, that, zeus, has, released, the, other, titans, which, he, imprisoned, at, the, conclusion, of, the, titanomachy, perhaps, foreshadowing, his, eventual, reconciliation, with, prometheus, in, the, trilogy, s, conclusion, prometheus, the, fire, bringer, it, seems, that, the, titan, finally, warns, zeus, not, to, sleep, with, the, sea, nymph, thetis, for, she, is, fated, to, beget, a, son, greater, than, the, father, not, wishing, to, be, overthrown, zeus, marries, thetis, off, to, the, mortal, peleus, the, product, of, that, union, is, achilles, greek, hero, of, the, trojan, war, after, reconciling, with, prometheus, zeus, probably, inaugurates, a, festival, in, his, honor, at, athens, of, aeschylus, other, plays, only, titles, and, assorted, fragments, are, known, there, are, enough, fragments, along, with, comments, made, by, later, authors, and, scholiasts, to, produce, rough, synopses, for, some, plays, this, play, was, based, on, books, 9, and, 16, of, the, iliad, achilles, sits, in, silent, indignation, over, his, humiliation, at, agamemnon, s, hands, for, most, of, the, play, envoys, from, the, greek, army, attempt, to, reconcile, achilles, to, agamemnon, but, he, yields, only, to, patroclus, who, then, battles, the, trojans, in, achilles, armour, the, bravery, and, death, of, patroclus, are, reported, in, a, messenger, s, speech, which, is, followed, by, mourning, this, play, was, based, on, books, 18, and, 19, and, 22, of, the, iliad, it, follows, the, daughters, of, nereus, the, sea, god, who, lament, patroclus, death, a, messenger, tells, how, achilles, perhaps, reconciled, to, agamemnon, and, the, greeks, slew, hector, after, a, brief, discussion, with, hermes, achilles, sits, in, silent, mourning, over, patroclus, hermes, then, brings, in, king, priam, of, troy, who, wins, over, achilles, and, ransoms, his, son, s, body, in, a, spectacular, coup, de, th, tre, a, scale, is, brought, on, stage, and, hector, s, body, is, placed, in,

the, play, in, the, republic, plato, quotes, the, line, god, plants, a, fault, in, mortals, when, he, wills, to, destroy, a, house, utterly, these, are, the, remaining, 71, plays, ascribed, to, aeschylus, which, are, known, the, theatre, was, just, beginning, to, evolve, when, aeschylus, started, writing, for, it, earlier, playwrights, such, as, thespis, had, already, expanded, the, cast, to, include, an, actor, who, was, able, to, interact, with, the, chorus, aeschylus, added, a, second, actor, allowing, for, greater, dramatic, variety, while, the, chorus, played, a, less, important,
