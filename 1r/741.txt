theologian, poet, composer, and, musician, in, philosophy, he, is, celebrated, for, his, logical, solution, to, the, problem, of, universals, via, nominalism, and, conceptualism, and, his, pioneering,

chief, forerunner, of, modern, empiricism, in, history, and, popular, culture, he, is, best, known, for, his, passionate, and, tragic, love, affair, and, intense, philosophical, exchange, with, his, brilliant, student, and, eventual, wife, h, lo, se, d, argenteuil, he, was, a, defender, of, women, and, of, their, education, after, having, sent, h, lo, se, to, a, convent, in, brittany, to, protect, her, from, her, abusive, uncle, who, did, not, want, her, to, pursue, this, forbidden, love, he, was, castrated, by, men, sent, by, the, uncle, still, considering, herself, as, his, spouse, even, though, both, retired, to, monasteries, after, this, event, h, lo, se, publicly, defended, him, when, his, doctrine, was, condemned, by, pope, innocent, ii, and, abelard, considered, a, heretic,

limbo, and, his, introduction, of, the, moral, influence, theory, of, atonement, he, is, considered, alongside, augustine, of, hippo, to, be, the, most, significant, forerunner, of, the, modern, self, reflective, autobiographer, he, paved, the, way, and, set, the, tone, for, later, epistolary, novels, and, celebrity, tell, alls, with, his, publicly, distributed, letter, the, history, of, my, calamities, and, public, correspondence, in, law, abelard, stressed, that, because, the, subjective, intention, determines, the, moral, value, of, human, action, the, legal, consequence, of, an, action, is, related, to, the, person, who, commits, it, and, not, merely, to, the, action, with, this, doctrine, abelard, created, in, the, middle, ages, the, idea, of, the, individual, subject, central, to, modern, law, this, eventually, gave, to, school, of, notre, dame, de, paris, later, the, university, of, paris, a, recognition, for, its, expertise, in, the, area, of, law, and, later, led, to, the, creation, of, a, faculty, of, law, of, paris, abelard, originally, called, pierre, le, pallet, was, born, c, 1079, in, le, pallet, about, 10, miles, 16, km, east, of, nantes, in, the, duchy, of, brittany, the, eldest, son, of, a, minor, noble, french, family, as, a, boy, he, learned, quickly, his, father, a, knight, called, berenger, encouraged, abelard, to, study, the, liberal, arts, wherein, he, excelled, at, the, art, of, dialectic, a, branch, of, philosophy, instead, of, entering, a, military, career, as, his, father, had, done, abelard, became, an, academic, during, his, early, academic, pursuits, abelard, wandered, throughout, france, debating, and, learning, so, as, in, his, own, words, he, became, such, a, one, as, the, peripatetics, he, first, studied, in, the, loire, area, where, the, nominalist, roscellinus, of, compi, gne, who, had, been, accused, of, heresy, by, anselm, was, his, teacher, during, this, period, around, 1100, abelard, s, travels, brought, him, to, paris, around, this, time, he, changed, his, surname, to, abelard, sometimes, written, abailard, or, abaelardus, the, etymological, root, of, abelard, could, be, the, middle, french, abilite, ability, the, hebrew, name, abel, habal, breath, vanity, figure, in, genesis, the, english, apple, or, the, latin, ballare, to, dance, the, name, is, jokingly, referenced, as, relating, to, lard, as, in, excessive, fatty, learning, in, a, secondary, anecdote, referencing, adelard, of, bath, and, peter, abelard, and, in, which, they, are, confused, to, be, one, person, in, the, great, cathedral, school, of, notre, dame, de, paris, before, the, construction, of, the, current, cathedral, there, he, studied, under, paris, archdeacon, and, notre, dame, master, william, of, champeaux, later, bishop, of, chalons, a, disciple, of, anselm, of, laon, not, to, be, confused, with, saint, anselm, a, leading, proponent, of, philosophical, realism, retrospectively, abelard, portrays, william, as, having, turned, from, approval, to, hostility, when, abelard, proved, soon, able, to, defeat, his, master, in, argument, this, resulted, in, a, long, duel, that, eventually, ended, in, the, downfall, of, the, theory, of, realism, which, was, replaced, by, abelard, s, theory, of, conceptualism, nominalism, while, abelard, s, thought, was, closer, to, william, s, thought, than, this, account, might, suggest, william, thought, abelard, was, too, arrogant, it, was, during, this, time, that, abelard, would, provoke, quarrels, with, both, william, and, roscellinus, against, opposition, from, the, metropolitan, teacher, abelard, set, up, his, own, school, first, at, melun, a, favoured, royal, residence, then, around, 1102, 04, for, more, direct, competition, he, moved, to, corbeil, nearer, paris, his, teaching, was, notably, successful, but, the, stress, taxed, his, constitution, leading, to, a, nervous, breakdown, and, a, trip, home, to, brittany, for, several, years, of, recovery, on, his, return, after, 1108, he, found, william, lecturing, at, the, hermitage, of, saint, victor, just, outside, the, le, de, la, cit, and, there, they, once, again, became, rivals, with, abelard, challenging, william, over, his, theory, of, universals, abelard, was, once, more, victorious, and, abelard, was, almost, able, to, attain, the, position, of, master, at, notre, dame, for, a, short, time, however, william, was, able, to, prevent, abelard, from, lecturing, in, paris, abelard, accordingly, was, forced, to, resume, his, school, at, melun, which, he, was, then, able, to, move, from, c, 1110, 12, to, paris, itself, on, the, heights, of, montagne, sainte, genevi, ve, overlooking, notre, dame, from, his, success, in, dialectic, he, next, turned, to, theology, and, in, 1113, moved, to, laon, to, attend, the, lectures, of, anselm, on, biblical, exegesis, and, christian, doctrine, unimpressed, by, anselm, s, teaching, abelard, began, to, offer, his, own, lectures, on, the, book, of, ezekiel, anselm, forbade, him, to, continue, this, teaching, abelard, returned, to, paris, where, in, around, 1115, he, became, master, of, the, cathedral, school, of, notre, dame, and, a, canon, of, sens, the, cathedral, of, the, archdiocese, to, which, paris, belonged, abelard, is, considered, one, of, the, founders, of, the, secular, university, and, pre, renaissance, secular, philosophical, thought, abelard, argued, for, conceptualism, in, the, theory, of, universals, a, universal, is, a, quality, or, property, which, every, individual, member, of, a, class, of, things, must, possess, if, the, same, word, is, to, apply, to, all, the, things, in, that, class, blueness, for, example, is, a, universal, property, possessed, by, all, blue, objects, according, to, abelard, scholar, david, luscombe, abelard, logically, elaborated, an, independent, philosophy, of, language, he, stressed, that, language, itself, is, not, able, to, demonstrate, the, truth, of, things, res, that, lie, in, the, domain, of, physics, writing, with, the, influence, of, his, wife, heloise, he, stressed, that, subjective, intention, determines, the, moral, value, of, human, action, with, heloise, he, is, the, first, significant, philosopher, of, the, middle, ages, to, push, for, intentionalist, ethics, he, helped, establish, the, philosophical, authority, of, aristotle, which, became, firmly, established, in, the, half, century, after, his, death, it, was, at, this, time, that, aristotle, s, organon, first, became, available, and, gradually, all, of, aristotle, s, other, surviving, works, before, this, the, works, of, plato, formed, the, basis, of, support, for, philosophical, realism, abelard, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, twelfth, century, catholic, philosophers, arguing, that, god, and, the, universe, can, and, should, be, known, via, logic, as, well, as, via, the, emotions, he, should, not, be, read, as, a, heretic, as, his, charges, of, heresy, were, dropped, and, rescinded, by, the, church, after, his, death, but, rather, as, a, cutting, edge, philosopher, who, pushed, theology, and, philosophy, to, their, limits, he, is, described, as, the, keenest, thinker, and, boldest, theologian, of, the, 12th, century, and, as, the, greatest, logician, of, the, middle, ages, his, genius, was, evident, in, all, he, did, as, the, first, to, use, theology, in, its, modern, sense, he, championed, reason, in, matters, of, faith, and, seemed, larger, than, life, to, his, contemporaries, his, quick, wit, sharp, tongue, perfect, memory, and, boundless, arrogance, made, him, unbeatable, in, debate, the, force, of, his, personality, impressed, itself, vividly, on, all, with, whom, he, came, into, contact, regarding, the, un, baptized, who, die, in, infancy, abelard, in, commentaria, in, epistolam, pauli, ad, romanos, emphasized, the, goodness, of, god, and, interpreted, augustine, s, mildest, punishment, as, the, pain, of, loss, at, being, denied, the, beatific, vision, carentia, visionis, dei, without, hope, of, obtaining, it, but, with, no, additional, punishments, his, thought, contributed, to, the, forming, of, limbo, of, infants, theory, in, the, 12th, 13th, centuries, abelard, was, concerned, with, the, concept, of, intent, and, inner, life, developing, an, elementary, theory, of, cognition, in, his, tractabus, de, intellectibus, and, later, developing, the, concept, that, human, beings, speak, to, god, with, their, thoughts, he, was, one, of, the, developers, of, the, insanity, defense, writing, in, scito, te, ipsum, of, this, small, children, and, of, course, insane, people, are, untouched, lack, reason, nothing, is, counted, as, sin, for, them, he, spearheaded, the, idea, that, mental, illness, was, a, natural, condition, and, debunked, the, idea, that, the, devil, caused, insanity, a, point, of, view, which, thomas, f, graham, argues, abelard, was, unable, to, separate, himself, from, objectively, to, argue, more, subtly, because, of, his, own, mental, health, abelard, stressed, that, subjective, intention, determines, the, moral, value, of, human, action, and, therefore, that, the, legal, consequence, of, an, action, is, related, to, the, person, that, commits, it, and, not, merely, to, the, action, with, this, doctrine, abelard, created, in, the, middle, ages, the, idea, of, the, individual, subject, central, to, modern, law, this, gave, to, school, of, notre, dame, de, paris, later, the, university, of, paris, a, recognition, for, its, expertise, in, the, area, of, law, even, before, the, faculty, of, law, existed, and, the, school, even, recognized, as, an, universitas, and, even, though, abelard, was, a, logician, and, a, theologian, abelard, was, also, long, known, as, an, important, poet, and, composer, he, composed, some, celebrated, love, songs, for, h, lo, se, that, are, now, lost, and, which, have, not, been, identified, in, the, anonymous, repertoire, one, known, romantic, poem, possible, lyric, remains, dull, is, the, star, h, lo, se, praised, these, songs, in, a, letter, the, great, charm, and, sweetness, in, language, and, music, and, a, soft, attractiveness, of, the, melody, obliged, even, the, unlettered, his, education, in, music, was, based, in, his, childhood, learning, of, the, traditional, quadrivium, studied, at, the, time, by, almost, all, aspiring, medieval, scholars, abelard, composed, a, hymnbook, for, the, religious, community, that, h, lo, se, joined, this, hymnbook, written, after, 1130, differed, from, contemporary, hymnals, such, as, that, of, bernard, of, clairvaux, in, that, abelard, used, completely, new, and, homogeneous, material, the, songs, were, grouped, by, metre, which, meant, that, it, was, possible, to, use, comparatively, few, melodies, only, one, melody, from, this, hymnal, survives, o, quanta, qualia, abelard, also, wrote, six, biblical, planctus, laments, in, surviving, manuscripts, these, pieces, have, been, notated, in, diastematic, neumes, which, resist, reliable, transcription, only, planctus, vi, was, fixed, in, square, notation, planctus, as, genre, influenced, the, subsequent, development, of, the, lai, a, song, form, that, flourished, in, northern, europe, in, the, 13th, and, 14th, centuries, melodies, that, have, survived, have, been, praised, as, flexible, expressive, melodies, show, an, elegance, and, technical, adroitness, that, are, very, similar, to, the, qualities, that, have, been, long, admired, in, abelard, s, poetry, h, lo, se, d, argenteuil, lived, within, the, precincts, of, notre, dame, under, the, care, of, her, uncle, the, secular, canon, fulbert, she, was, famous, as, the, most, well, educated, and, intelligent, woman, in, paris, renowned, for, her, knowledge, of, classical, letters, including, not, only, latin, but, also, greek, and, hebrew, at, the, time, heloise, met, abelard, he, was, surrounded, by, crowds, supposedly, thousands, of, students, drawn, from, all, countries, by, the, fame, of, his, teaching, enriched, by, the, offerings, of, his, pupils, and, entertained, with, universal, admiration, he, came, to, think, of, himself, as, the, only, undefeated, philosopher, in, the, world, but, a, change, in, his, fortunes, was, at, hand, in, his, devotion, to, science, he, claimed, to, have, lived, a, very, straight, and, narrow, life, enlivened, only, by, philosophical, debate, now, at, the, height, of, his, fame, he, encountered, romance, upon, deciding, to, pursue, h, lo, se, abelard, sought, a, place, in, fulbert, s, house, and, by, 1115, or, 1116, began, an, affair, in, abelard, s, autobiography, he, describes, the, relationship, as, a, seduction, he, used, example, phrases, in, his, teaching, such, as, peter, loves, his, girl, and, he, wrote, popular, poems, and, songs, of, his, love, that, spread, throughout, the, country, heloise, s, letters, depict, a, relationship, of, equals, kindled, by, mutual, attraction, once, fulbert, found, out, he, separated, them, but, they, continued, to, meet, in, secret, h, lo, se, became, pregnant, and, was, sent, by, abelard, to, be, looked, after, by, his, family, in, brittany, where, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, whom, she, named, astrolabe, after, the, scientific, instrument, to, appease, fulbert, abelard, proposed, a, marriage, h, lo, se, initially, opposed, marriage, but, to, appease, her, worries, about, abelard, s, career, prospects, as, a, married, philosopher, the, couple, were, married, in, secret, at, this, time, clerical, celibacy, was, becoming, the, standard, at, higher, levels, in, the, church, orders, to, avoid, suspicion, of, involvement, with, abelard, heloise, continued, to, stay, at, her, uncle, s, house, when, fulbert, publicly, disclosed, the, marriage, h, lo, se, vehemently, denied, it, arousing, fulbert, s, wrath, and, abuse, abelard, sent, her, to, the, convent, at, argenteuil, where, she, had, been, brought, up, in, an, attempt, to, protect, her, from, her, uncle, h, lo, se, dressed, as, a, nun, and, shared, the, nuns, life, though, she, was, not, consecrated, fulbert, infuriated, that, heloise, had, been, taken, from, his, house, and, possibly, believing, that, abelard, had, disposed, of, her, at, argenteuil, in, order, to, be, rid, of, her, arranged, for, a, band, of, men, to, break, into, abelard, s, room, one, night, and, castrate, him, in, legal, retribution, for, this, vigilante, attack, members, of, the, band, were, punished, and, fulbert, scorned, by, the, public, took, temporary, leave, of, his, canon, duties, he, does, not, appear, again, in, the, paris, cartularies, for, several, years, in, shame, of, his, injuries, abelard, retired, permanently, as, a, notre, dame, canon, with, any, career, as, a, priest, or, ambitions, for, higher, office, in, the, church, shattered, by, his, loss, of, manhood, he, effectively, hid, himself, as, a, monk, at, the, monastery, of, st, denis, near, paris, avoiding, the, questions, of, his, horrified, public, roscellinus, and, fulk, of, deuil, ridiculed, and, belittled, abelard, for, being, castrated, upon, joining, the, monastery, at, st, denis, abelard, insisted, that, h, lo, se, take, vows, as, a, nun, she, had, few, other, options, at, the, time, h, lo, se, protested, her, separation, from, abelard, sending, numerous, letters, re, initiating, their, friendship, and, demanding, answers, to, theological, questions, concerning, her, new, vocation, shortly, after, the, birth, of, their, child, astrolabe, h, lo, se, and, abelard, were, both, cloistered, their, son, was, thus, brought, up, by, abelard, s, sister, dionysia, at, abelard, s, childhood, home, in, le, pallet, his, name, derives, from, the, astrolabe, a, persian, astronomical, instrument, said, to, elegantly, model, the, universe, and, which, was, popularized, in, france, by, adelard, of, bath, he, is, mentioned, in, abelard, s, poem, to, his, son, the, carmen, astralabium, and, by, abelard, s, protector, peter, the, venerable, of, cluny, who, wrote, to, h, loise, i, will, gladly, do, my, best, to, obtain, a, prebend, in, one, of, the, great, churches, for, your, astrolabe, who, is, also, ours, for, your, sake, petrus, astralabius, is, recorded, at, the, cathedral, of, nantes, in, 1150, and, the, same, name, appears, again, later, at, the, cistercian, abbey, at, hauterive, in, what, is, now, switzerland, given, the, extreme, eccentricity, of, the, name, it, is, almost, certain, that, these, references, are, to, the, same, person, astrolabe, is, recorded, in, the, paraclete, necrology, as, dying, on, 29, or, 30, october, year, unknown, appearing, as, petrus, astralabius, magistri, nostri, petri, filius, son, of, our, master, peter, in, his, early, forties, abelard, sought, to, bury, himself, as, a, monk, of, the, abbey, of, saint, denis, with, his, woes, out, of, sight, finding, no, respite, in, the, cloister, and, having, gradually, turned, again, to, study, he, gave, in, to, urgent, entreaties, and, reopened, his, school, at, an, unknown, priory, owned, by, the, monastery, his, lectures, now, framed, in, a, devotional, spirit, and, with, lectures, on, theology, as, well, as, his, previous, lectures, on, logic, were, once, again, heard, by, crowds, of, students, and, his, old, influence, seemed, to, have, returned, using, his, studies, of, the, bible, and, in, his, view, inconsistent, writings, of, the, leaders, of, the, church, as, his, basis, he, wrote, sic, et, non, yes, and, no, no, sooner, had, he, published, his, theological, lectures, the, theologia, summi, boni, than, his, adversaries, picked, up, on, his, rationalistic, interpretation, of, the, trinitarian, dogma, two, pupils, of, anselm, of, laon, alberich, of, reims, and, lotulf, of, lombardy, instigated, proceedings, against, abelard, charging, him, with, sabellianism, in, a, provincial, synod, held, at, soissons, in, 1121, through, irregular, procedures, they, obtained, an, official, condemnation, of, his, teaching, and, abelard, was, made, to, burn, a, copy, of, the, theologia, himself, he, was, then, sentenced, to, perpetual, confinement, in, a, monastery, other, than, his, own, but, it, seems, to, have, been, agreed, in, advance, that, this, sentence, would, be, revoked, almost, immediately, because, after, a, few, days, in, the, convent, of, st, medard, at, soissons, abelard, returned, to, st, denis, life, in, his, own, monastery, proved, no, more, congenial, than, before, for, this, abelard, himself, was, partly, responsible, since, at, least, the, ninth, century, the, legends, of, dionysius, the, areopagite, and, denis, of, paris, had, often, been, conflated, largely, due, to, hilduin, abbot, of, saint, denis, eager, to, promote, the, dignity, of, the, abbey, the, monastic, community, at, saint, denis, took, pride, in, this, supposed, connection, abelard, teasingly, pointed, out, a, possibility, that, the, founder, of, the, abbey, could, have, been, another, dionysius, who, is, mentioned, as, dionysius, of, corinth, by, eusebius, this, irritated, the, monks, so, much, that, eventually, abelard, was, allowed, to, leave, abelard, initially, lodged, at, st, ayoul, of, provins, where, the, prior, was, a, friend, then, after, the, death, of, abbot, adam, in, march, 1122, abelard, was, able, to, gain, permission, from, the, new, abbot, suger, to, live, in, whatever, solitary, place, he, wished, in, a, deserted, place, near, nogent, sur, seine, in, champagne, he, built, a, cabin, of, stubble, and, reeds, created, a, simple, oratory, dedicated, to, the, trinity, and, became, a, hermit, when, his, retreat, became, known, students, flocked, from, paris, and, covered, the, wilderness, around, him, with, their, tents, and, huts, he, began, to, teach, again, there, the, oratory, was, rebuilt, in, wood, and, stone, and, rededicated, as, the, oratory, of, the, paraclete, abelard, remained, at, the, paraclete, for, about, five, years, his, combination, of, the, teaching, of, secular, arts, with, his, profession, as, a, monk, was, heavily, criticized, by, other, men, of, religion, and, abelard, contemplated, flight, outside, christendom, altogether, abelard, therefore, decided, to, leave, and, find, another, refuge, accepting, sometime, between, 1126, and, 1128, an, invitation, to, preside, over, the, abbey, of, saint, gildas, de, rhuys, on, the, far, off, shore, of, lower, brittany, the, region, was, inhospitable, the, domain, a, prey, to, outlaws, the, house, itself, savage, and, disorderly, there, too, his, relations, with, the, community, deteriorated, lack, of, success, at, st, gildas, made, abelard, decide, to, take, up, public, teaching, again, although, he, remained, for, a, few, more, years, officially, abbot, of, st, gildas, it, is, not, entirely, certain, what, he, then, did, but, given, that, john, of, salisbury, heard, abelard, lecture, on, dialectic, in, 1136, it, is, presumed, that, he, returned, to, paris, and, resumed, teaching, on, the, montagne, sainte, genevi, ve, his, lectures, were, dominated, by, logic, at, least, until, 1136, when, he, produced, further, drafts, of, his, theologia, in, which, he, analyzed, the, sources, of, belief, in, the, trinity, and, praised, the, pagan, philosophers, of, classical, antiquity, for, their, virtues, and, for, their, discovery, by, the, use, of, reason, of, many, fundamental, aspects, of, christian, revelation, in, 1128, abbot, suger, claimed, that, the, convent, at, argenteuil, where, h, lo, se, was, prioress, belonged, to, his, abbey, of, st, denis, in, 1129, he, gained, possession, and, he, made, no, provision, for, the, nuns, when, abelard, heard, he, transferred, paraclete, and, its, lands, to, h, lo, se, and, her, remaining, nuns, making, her, abbess, he, provided, the, new, community, with, a, rule, and, with, a, justification, of, the, nun, s, way, of, life, in, this, he, emphasized, the, virtue, of, literary, study, he, also, provided, books, of, hymns, he, had, composed, and, in, the, early, 1130s, he, and, h, lo, se, composed, a, collection, of, their, own, love, letters, and, religious, correspondence, containing, amongst, other, notable, pieces, abelard, s, most, famous, letter, containing, his, autobiography, historia, calamitatum, the, history, of, my, calamities, this, moved, h, lo, se, to, write, her, first, letter, the, first, being, followed, by, the, two, other, letters, in, which, she, finally, accepted, the, part, of, resignation, which, now, as, a, brother, to, a, sister, abelard, commended, to, her, sometime, before, 1140, abelard, published, his, masterpiece, ethica, or, scito, te, ipsum, know, thyself, where, he, analyzes, the, idea, of, sin, and, that, actions, are, not, what, a, man, will, be, judged, for, but, intentions, during, this, period, he, also, wrote, dialogus, inter, philosophum, judaeum, et, christianum, dialogue, between, a, philosopher, a, jew, and, a, christian, and, also, expositio, in, epistolam, ad, romanos, a, commentary, on, st, paul, s, epistle, to, the, romans, where, he, expands, on, the, meaning, of, christ, s, life, it, is, not, clear, whether, abelard, stopped, teaching, after, 1136, or, whether, he, continued, with, all, except, his, lectures, on, logic, until, as, late, as, 1141, whatever, the, exact, timing, a, process, was, instigated, by, william, of, st, thierry, who, discovered, what, he, considered, to, be, heresies, in, some, of, abelard, s, teaching, in, spring, 1140, he, wrote, to, the, bishop, of, chartres, and, to, bernard, of, clairvaux, denouncing, them, another, less, distinguished, theologian, thomas, of, morigny, also, produced, at, the, same, time, a, list, of, abelard, s, supposed, heresies, perhaps, at, bernard, s, instigation, bernard, s, complaint, mainly, was, that, abelard, had, applied, logic, where, it, is, not, applicable, and, that, is, illogical, amid, pressure, from, bernard, abelard, challenged, bernard, either, to, withdraw, his, accusations, or, to, make, them, publicly, at, the, important, church, council, at, sens, planned, for, 2, june, 1141, in, so, doing, abelard, put, himself, into, the, position, of, the, wronged, party, and, forced, bernard, to, defend, himself, from, the, accusation, of, slander, bernard, avoided, this, trap, however, on, the, eve, of, the, council, he, called, a, private, meeting, of, the, assembled, bishops, and, persuaded, them, to, condemn, one, by, one, each, of, the, heretical, propositions, he, attributed, to, abelard, when, abelard, appeared, at, the, council, the, next, day, he, was, presented, with, a, list, of, condemned, propositions, imputed, to, him, unable, to, answer, to, these, propositions, abelard, left, the, assembly, appealed, to, the, pope, and, set, off, for, rome, hoping, that, the, pope, would, be, more, supportive, however, this, hope, was, unfounded, on, 16, july, 1141, pope, innocent, ii, issued, a, bull, excommunicating, abelard, and, his, followers, and, imposing, perpetual, silence, on, him, and, in, a, second, document, he, ordered, abelard, to, be, confined, in, a, monastery, and, his, books, to, be, burned, abelard, was, saved, from, this, sentence, however, by, peter, the, venerable, abbot, of, cluny, abelard, had, stopped, there, on, his, way, to, rome, before, the, papal, condemnation, had, reached, france, peter, persuaded, abelard, already, old, to, give, up, his, journey, and, stay, at, the, monastery, peter, managed, to, arrange, a, reconciliation, with, bernard, to, have, the, sentence, of, excommunication, lifted, and, to, persuade, innocent, that, it, was, enough, if, abelard, remained, under, the, aegis, of, cluny, abelard, suffered, at, least, two, nervous, collapses, the, first, around, 1104, 5, cited, as, due, to, the, stresses, of, too, much, study, in, his, words, not, long, afterward, though, my, health, broke, down, under, the, strain, of, too, much, study, and, i, had, to, return, home, to, brittany, i, was, away, from, france, for, several, years, bitterly, missed, his, second, documented, collapse, took, place, in, 1141, at, the, council, of, sens, where, he, was, accused, of, heresy, and, was, unable, to, speak, in, reply, in, the, words, of, geoffrey, of, auxerre, his, memory, became, very, confused, his, reason, blacked, out, and, his, interior, sense, forsook, him, medieval, understanding, of, mental, health, precedes, development, of, modern, psychiatric, diagnosis, no, diagnosis, besides, ill, health, was, applied, to, abelard, at, the, time, his, tendencies, towards, self, acclaim, grandiosity, paranoia, and, shame, are, suggestive, of, possible, latent, narcissism, despite, his, great, talents, and, fame, or, recently, conjectured, in, keeping, with, his, breakdowns, overwork, loquaciousness, and, belligerence, mood, related, mental, health, issues, such, as, mania, related, to, bipolar, disorder, at, the, time, some, of, these, characteristics, were, attributed, disparagingly, to, his, breton, heritage, his, difficult, indomitable, personality, and, overwork, abelard, spent, his, final, months, at, the, priory, of, st, marcel, near, chalon, sur, sa, ne, before, he, died, on, 21, april, 1142, he, is, said, to, have, uttered, the, last, words, i, don, t, know, before, expiring, he, died, from, a, fever, while, suffering, from, a, skin, disorder, possibly, mange, or, scurvy, heloise, and, peter, of, cluny, arranged, with, the, pope, after, abelard, s, death, to, clear, his, name, of, heresy, charges, abelard, was, first, buried, at, st, marcel, but, his, remains, were, soon, carried, off, secretly, to, the, paraclete, and, given, over, to, the, loving, care, of, h, lo, se, who, in, time, came, herself, to, rest, beside, them, in, 1163, the, bones, of, the, pair, were, moved, more, than, once, afterwards, but, they, were, preserved, even, through, the, vicissitudes, of, the, french, revolution, and, now, are, presumed, to, lie, in, the, well, known, tomb, in, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, eastern, paris, the, transfer, of, their, remains, there, in, 1817, is, considered, to, have, considerably, contributed, to, the, popularity, of, that, cemetery, at, the, time, still, far, outside, the, built, up, area, of, paris, by, tradition, lovers, or, lovelorn, singles, leave, letters, at, the, crypt, in, tribute, to, the, couple, or, in, hope, of, finding, true, love, this, second, burial, remains, disputed, the, oratory, of, the, paraclete, claims, abelard, and, h, lo, se, are, buried, there, and, that, what, exists, in, p, re, lachaise, is, merely, a, monument, or, cenotaph, according, to, p, re, lachaise, the, remains, of, both, lovers, were, transferred, from, the, oratory, in, the, early, 19th, century, and, reburied, in, the, famous, crypt, on, their, grounds, others, believe, that, while, abelard, is, buried, in, the, tomb, at, p, re, lachaise, helo, se, s, remains, are, elsewhere, novelist, and, abelard, scholar, george, moore, referred, to, abelard, as, the, first, protestant, prior, to, martin, luther, while, abelard, conflicted, with, the, church, to, the, point, of, later, cleared, heresy, charges, he, never, denied, his, catholic, faith, during, his, general, audience, on, 4, november, 2009, pope, benedict, xvi, talked, about, saint, bernard, of, clairvaux, and, peter, abelard, to, illustrate, differences, in, the, monastic, and, scholastic, approaches, to, theology, in, the, 12th, century, the, pope, recalled, that, theology, is, the, search, for, a, rational, understanding, if, possible, of, the, mysteries, of, christian, revelation, which, is, believed, through, faith, faith, that, seeks, intelligibility, fides, quaerens, intellectum, but, st, bernard, a, representative, of, monastic, theology, emphasized, faith, whereas, abelard, who, is, a, scholastic, stressed, understanding, through, reason, for, bernard, of, clairvaux, faith, is, based, on, the, testimony, of, scripture, and, on, the, teaching, of, the, fathers, of, the, church, thus, bernard, found, it, difficult, to, agree, with, abelard, and, in, a, more, general, way, with, those, who, would, subject, the, truths, of, faith, to, the, critical, examination, of, reason, an, examination, which, in, his, opinion, posed, a, grave, danger, intellectualism, the, relativizing, of, truth, and, the, questioning, of, the, truths, of, faith, themselves, theology, for, bernard, could, be, nourished, only, in, contemplative, prayer, by, the, affective, union, of, the, heart, and, mind, with, god, with, only, one, purpose, to, promote, the, living, intimate, experience, of, god, an, aid, to, loving, god, ever, more, and, ever, better, according, to, pope, benedict, xvi, an, excessive, use, of, philosophy, rendered, abelard, s, doctrine, of, the, trinity, fragile, and, thus, his, idea, of, god, in, the, field, of, morals, his, teaching, was, vague, as, he, insisted, on, considering, the, intention, of, the, subject, as, the, only, basis, for, describing, the, goodness, or, evil, of, moral, acts, thereby, ignoring, the, objective, meaning, and, moral, value, of, the, acts, resulting, in, a, dangerous, subjectivism, but, the, pope, recognized, the, great, achievements, of, abelard, who, made, a, decisive, contribution, to, the, development, of, scholastic, theology, which, eventually, expressed, itself, in, a, more, mature, and, fruitful, way, during, the, following, century, and, some, of, abelard, s, insights, should, not, be, underestimated, for, example, his, affirmation, that, non, christian, religious, traditions, already, contain, some, form, of, preparation, for, welcoming, christ, pope, benedict, xvi, concluded, that, bernard, s, theology, of, the, heart, and, abelard, s, theology, of, reason, represent, the, importance, of, healthy, theological, discussion, and, humble, obedience, to, the, authority, of, the, church, especially, when, the, questions, being, debated, have, not, been, defined, by, the, magisterium, both, st, bernard, and, abelard, always, recognized, without, any, hesitation, the, authority, of, the, magisterium, abelard, showed, humility, in, acknowledging, his, errors, and, bernard, exercised, great, benevolence, the, pope, emphasized, that, a, balance, should, exist, between, divine, principles, in, the, field, of, theology, which, principles, are, given, through, revelation, and, which, always, maintain, their, primary, importance, and, the, interpretative, principles, proposed, by, philosophy, that, is, by, reason, which, have, an, important, function, but, only, as, a, tool, when, the, balance, breaks, down, theological, reflection, runs, the, risk, of, becoming, marred, by, error, it, is, then, up, to, the, magisterium, to, exercise, the, needed, service, to, truth, for, which, it, is, responsible
