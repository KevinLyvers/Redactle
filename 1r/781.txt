as, one, of, the, most, influential, political, philosophers, of, the, 20th, century, in, 1990, will, kymlicka, wrote, in, his, introduction, to, the, field, that, it, is, generally, accepted, that, the, recent, rebirth, of, normative, political, philosophy, began, with, the, publication, of, john, rawls, s, a, theory, of, justice, in, 1971, rawls, s, theory, of, justice, as, fairness, recommends, equal, basic, liberties, equality, of, opportunity, and, facilitating, the, maximum, benefit, to, the, least, advantaged, members, of, society, in, any, case, where, inequalities, may, occur, rawls, s, argument, for, these, principles, of, social, justice, uses, a, thought, experiment, called, the, original, position, in, which, people, deliberately, select, what, kind, of, society, they, would, choose, to, live, in, if, they, did, not, know, which, social, position, they, would, personally, occupy, in, his, later, work, political, liberalism, 1993, rawls, turned, to, the, question, of, how, political, power, could, be, made, legitimate, given, reasonable, disagreement, about, the, nature, of, the, good, life, rawls, received, both, the, schock, prize, for, logic, and, philosophy, and, the, national, humanities, medal, in, 1999, the, latter, was, presented, by, president, bill, clinton, in, recognition, of, how, his, works, revived, the, disciplines, of, political, and, ethical, philosophy, with, his, argument, that, a, society, in, which, the, most, fortunate, help, the, least, fortunate, is, not, only, a, moral, society, but, a, logical, one, among, contemporary, political, philosophers, rawls, is, frequently, cited, by, the, courts, of, law, in, the, united, states, and, canada, and, referred, to, by, practicing, politicians, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, in, a, 2008, national, survey, of, political, theorists, based, on, 1, 086, responses, from, professors, at, accredited, four, year, colleges, and, universities, in,

that, same, year, he, moved, to, harvard, university, where, he, taught, for, almost, forty, years, and, where, he, trained, some, of, the, leading, contemporary, figures, in, moral, and, political, philosophy, including, sibyl, a, schwarzenbach, thomas, nagel, allan, gibbard, onora, o, neill, adrian, piper, arnold, davidson, elizabeth, s, anderson, christine, korsgaard, susan, neiman, claudia,

membership, by, milton, friedman, in, 1968, and, withdrew, from, the, society, three, years, later, just, before, his, a, theory, of, justice, was, published, rawls, rarely, gave, interviews, and, having, both, a, stutter, partially, caused, by, the, deaths, of, two, of, his, brothers, who, died, through, infections, contracted, from, rawls, and, a, bat, like, horror, of, the, limelight, did, not, become, a, public, intellectual, despite, his, fame, he, instead, remained, committed, mainly, to, his, academic, and, family, life, in, 1995, he, had, the, first, of, several, strokes, severely, impeding, his, ability, to, continue, to, work, he, was, nevertheless, able, to, complete, the, law, of, peoples, the, most, complete, statement, of, his, views, on, international, justice, and, published, in, 2001, shortly, before, his, death, justice, as, fairness, a, restatement, a, response, to, criticisms, of, a, theory, of, justice, rawls, died, from, heart, failure, at, his, home, in, lexington, massachusetts, on, november, 24, 2002, at, age, 81, he, was, buried, at, the, mount, auburn, cemetery, in, massachusetts, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, four, children, and, four, grandchildren, rawls, published, three, main, books, the, first, a, theory, of, justice, focused, on, distributive, justice, and, attempted, to, reconcile, the, competing, claims, of, the, values, of, freedom, and, equality, the, second, political, liberalism, addressed, the, question, of, how, citizens, divided, by, intractable, religious, and, philosophical, disagreements, could, come, to, endorse, a, constitutional, democratic, regime, the, third, the, law, of, peoples, focused, on, the, issue, of, global, justice, a, theory, of, justice, published, in, 1971, aimed, to, resolve, the, seemingly, competing, claims, of, freedom, and, equality, the, shape, rawls, s, resolution, took, however, was, not, that, of, a, balancing, act, that, compromised, or, weakened, the, moral, claim, of, one, value, compared, with, the, other, rather, his, intent, was, to, show, that, notions, of, freedom, and, equality, could, be, integrated, into, a, seamless, unity, he, called, justice, as, fairness, by, attempting, to, enhance, the, perspective, which, his, readers, should, take, when, thinking, about, justice, rawls, hoped, to, show, the, supposed, conflict, between, freedom, and, equality, to, be, illusory, rawls, s, a, theory, of, justice, 1971, includes, a, thought, experiment, he, called, the, original, position, the, intuition, motivating, its, employment, is, this, the, enterprise, of, political, philosophy, will, be, greatly, benefited, by, a, specification, of, the, correct, standpoint, a, person, should, take, in, their, thinking, about, justice, when, we, think, about, what, it, would, mean, for, a, just, state, of, affairs, to, obtain, between, persons, we, eliminate, certain, features, such, as, hair, or, eye, color, height, race, etc, and, fixate, upon, others, rawls, s, original, position, is, meant, to, encode, all, of, our, intuitions, about, which, features, are, relevant, and, which, irrelevant, for, the, purposes, of, deliberating, well, about, justice, the, original, position, is, rawls, s, hypothetical, scenario, in, which, a, group, of, persons, is, set, the, task, of, reaching, an, agreement, about, the, kind, of, political, and, economic, structure, they, want, for, a, society, which, they, will, then, occupy, each, individual, however, deliberates, behind, a, veil, of, ignorance, each, lacks, knowledge, for, example, of, their, gender, race, age, intelligence, wealth, skills, education, and, religion, the, only, thing, that, a, given, member, knows, about, themselves, is, that, they, are, in, possession, of, the, basic, capacities, necessary, to, fully, and, willfully, participate, in, an, enduring, system, of, mutual, cooperation, each, knows, they, can, be, a, member, of, the, society, rawls, posits, two, basic, capacities, that, the, individuals, would, know, themselves, to, possess, first, individuals, know, that, they, have, the, capacity, to, form, pursue, and, revise, a, conception, of, the, good, or, life, plan, exactly, what, sort, of, conception, of, the, good, this, is, however, the, individual, does, not, yet, know, it, may, be, for, example, religious, or, secular, but, at, the, start, the, individual, in, the, original, position, does, not, know, which, second, each, individual, understands, themselves, to, have, the, capacity, to, develop, a, sense, of, justice, and, a, generally, effective, desire, to, abide, by, it, knowing, only, these, two, features, of, themselves, the, group, will, deliberate, in, order, to, design, a, social, structure, during, which, each, person, will, seek, their, maximal, advantage, the, idea, is, that, proposals, that, we, would, ordinarily, think, of, as, unjust, such, as, that, black, people, or, women, should, not, be, allowed, to, hold, public, office, will, not, be, proposed, in, this, rawls, s, original, position, because, it, would, be, irrational, to, propose, them, the, reason, is, simple, one, does, not, know, whether, he, himself, would, be, a, woman, or, a, black, person, this, position, is, expressed, in, the, difference, principle, according, to, which, in, a, system, of, ignorance, about, one, s, status, one, would, strive, to, improve, the, position, of, the, worst, off, because, he, might, find, himself, in, that, position, rawls, develops, his, original, position, by, modeling, it, in, certain, respects, at, least, after, the, initial, situations, of, various, social, contract, thinkers, who, came, before, him, including, thomas, hobbes, john, locke, and, jean, jacques, rousseau, each, social, contractarian, constructs, their, initial, situation, somewhat, differently, having, in, mind, a, unique, political, morality, they, intend, the, thought, experiment, to, generate, iain, king, has, suggested, the, original, position, draws, on, rawls, s, experiences, in, post, war, japan, where, the, us, army, was, challenged, with, designing, new, social, and, political, authorities, for, the, country, while, imagining, away, all, that, had, gone, before, in, social, justice, processes, each, person, early, on, makes, decisions, about, which, features, of, persons, to, consider, and, which, to, ignore, rawls, s, aspiration, is, to, have, created, a, thought, experiment, whereby, a, version, of, that, process, is, carried, to, its, completion, illuminating, the, correct, standpoint, a, person, should, take, in, their, thinking, about, justice, if, he, has, succeeded, then, the, original, position, thought, experiment, may, function, as, a, full, specification, of, the, moral, standpoint, we, should, attempt, to, achieve, when, deliberating, about, social, justice, in, setting, out, his, theory, rawls, described, his, method, as, one, of, reflective, equilibrium, a, concept, which, has, since, been, used, in, other, areas, of, philosophy, reflective, equilibrium, is, achieved, by, mutually, adjusting, one, s, general, principles, and, one, s, considered, judgements, on, particular, cases, to, bring, the, two, into, line, with, one, another, rawls, derives, two, principles, of, justice, from, the, original, position, the, first, of, these, is, the, liberty, principle, which, establishes, equal, basic, liberties, for, all, citizens, basic, liberty, entails, the, familiar, in, the, liberal, tradition, freedoms, of, conscience, association, and, expression, as, well, as, democratic, rights, rawls, also, includes, a, personal, property, right, but, this, is, defended, in, terms, of, moral, capacities, and, self, respect, rather, than, an, appeal, to, a, natural, right, of, self, ownership, this, distinguishes, rawls, s, account, from, the, classical, liberalism, of, john, locke, and, the, libertarianism, of, robert, nozick, rawls, argues, that, a, second, principle, of, equality, would, be, agreed, upon, to, guarantee, liberties, that, represent, meaningful, options, for, all, in, society, and, ensure, distributive, justice, for, example, formal, guarantees, of, political, voice, and, freedom, of, assembly, are, of, little, real, worth, to, the, desperately, poor, and, marginalized, in, society, demanding, that, everyone, have, exactly, the, same, effective, opportunities, in, life, would, almost, certainly, offend, the, very, liberties, that, are, supposedly, being, equalized, nonetheless, we, would, want, to, ensure, at, least, the, fair, worth, of, our, liberties, wherever, one, ends, up, in, society, one, wants, life, to, be, worth, living, with, enough, effective, freedom, to, pursue, personal, goals, thus, participants, would, be, moved, to, affirm, a, two, part, second, principle, comprising, fair, equality, of, opportunity, and, the, famous, and, controversial, difference, principle, this, second, principle, ensures, that, those, with, comparable, talents, and, motivation, face, roughly, similar, life, chances, and, that, inequalities, in, society, work, to, the, benefit, of, the, least, advantaged, rawls, held, that, these, principles, of, justice, apply, to, the, basic, structure, of, fundamental, social, institutions, such, as, the, judiciary, the, economic, structure, and, the, political, constitution, a, qualification, that, has, been, the, source, of, some, controversy, and, constructive, debate, see, the, work, of, gerald, cohen, rawls, s, theory, of, justice, stakes, out, the, task, of, equalizing, the, distribution, of, primary, social, goods, to, those, least, advantaged, in, society, and, thus, may, be, seen, as, a, largely, political, answer, to, the, question, of, justice, with, matters, of, morality, somewhat, conflated, into, a, political, account, of, justice, and, just, institutions, relational, approaches, to, the, question, of, justice, by, contrast, seek, to, examine, the, connections, between, individuals, and, focuses, on, their, relations, in, societies, with, respect, to, how, these, relationships, are, established, and, configured, rawls, further, argued, that, these, principles, were, to, be, lexically, ordered, to, award, priority, to, basic, liberties, over, the, more, equality, oriented, demands, of, the, second, principle, this, has, also, been, a, topic, of, much, debate, among, moral, and, political, philosophers, finally, rawls, took, his, approach, as, applying, in, the, first, instance, to, what, he, called, a, well, ordered, society, designed, to, advance, the, good, of, its, members, and, effectively, regulated, by, a, public, conception, of, justice, in, this, respect, he, understood, justice, as, fairness, as, a, contribution, to, ideal, theory, the, determination, of, principles, that, characterize, a, well, ordered, society, under, favorable, circumstances, in, political, liberalism, 1993, rawls, turned, towards, the, question, of, political, legitimacy, in, the, context, of, intractable, philosophical, religious, and, moral, disagreement, amongst, citizens, regarding, the, human, good, such, disagreement, he, insisted, was, reasonable, the, result, of, the, free, exercise, of, human, rationality, under, the, conditions, of, open, enquiry, and, free, conscience, that, the, liberal, state, is, designed, to, safeguard, the, question, of, legitimacy, in, the, face, of, reasonable, disagreement, was, urgent, for, rawls, because, his, own, justification, of, justice, as, fairness, relied, upon, a, kantian, conception, of, the, human, good, that, can, be, reasonably, rejected, if, the, political, conception, offered, in, a, theory, of, justice, can, only, be, shown, to, be, good, by, invoking, a, controversial, conception, of, human, flourishing, it, is, unclear, how, a, liberal, state, ordered, according, to, it, could, possibly, be, legitimate, the, intuition, animating, this, seemingly, new, concern, is, actually, no, different, from, the, guiding, idea, of, a, theory, of, justice, namely, that, the, fundamental, charter, of, a, society, must, rely, only, on, principles, arguments, and, reasons, that, cannot, be, reasonably, rejected, by, the, citizens, whose, lives, will, be, limited, by, its, social, legal, and, political, circumscriptions, in, other, words, the, legitimacy, of, a, law, is, contingent, upon, its, justification, being, impossible, to, reasonably, reject, this, old, insight, took, on, a, new, shape, however, when, rawls, realized, that, its, application, must, extend, to, the, deep, justification, of, justice, as, fairness, itself, which, he, had, presented, in, terms, of, a, reasonably, rejectable, kantian, conception, of, human, flourishing, as, the, free, development, of, autonomous, moral, agency, the, core, of, political, liberalism, is, its, insistence, that, in, order, to, retain, its, legitimacy, the, liberal, state, must, commit, itself, to, the, ideal, of, public, reason, this, roughly, means, that, citizens, in, their, public, capacity, must, engage, one, another, only, in, terms, of, reasons, whose, status, as, reasons, is, shared, between, them, political, reasoning, then, is, to, proceed, purely, in, terms, of, public, reasons, for, example, a, supreme, court, justice, deliberating, on, whether, or, not, the, denial, to, homosexuals, of, the, ability, to, marry, constitutes, a, violation, of, the, 14th, amendment, s, equal, protection, clause, may, not, advert, to, his, religious, convictions, on, the, matter, but, he, may, take, into, account, the, argument, that, a, same, sex, household, provides, sub, optimal, conditions, for, a, child, s, development, this, is, because, reasons, based, upon, the, interpretation, of, sacred, text, are, non, public, their, force, as, reasons, relies, upon, faith, commitments, that, can, be, reasonably, rejected, whereas, reasons, that, rely, upon, the, value, of, providing, children, with, environments, in, which, they, may, develop, optimally, are, public, reasons, their, status, as, reasons, draws, upon, no, deep, controversial, conception, of, human, flourishing, rawls, held, that, the, duty, of, civility, the, duty, of, citizens, to, offer, one, another, reasons, that, are, mutually, understood, as, reasons, applies, within, what, he, called, the, public, political, forum, this, forum, extends, from, the, upper, reaches, of, government, for, example, the, supreme, legislative, and, judicial, bodies, of, the, society, all, the, way, down, to, the, deliberations, of, a, citizen, deciding, for, whom, to, vote, in, state, legislatures, or, how, to, vote, in, public, referendums, campaigning, politicians, should, also, he, believed, refrain, from, pandering, to, the, non, public, religious, or, moral, convictions, of, their, constituencies, the, ideal, of, public, reason, secures, the, dominance, of, the, public, political, values, freedom, equality, and, fairness, that, serve, as, the, foundation, of, the, liberal, state, but, what, about, the, justification, of, these, values, since, any, such, justification, would, necessarily, draw, upon, deep, religious, or, moral, metaphysical, commitments, which, would, be, reasonably, rejectable, rawls, held, that, the, public, political, values, may, only, be, justified, privately, by, individual, citizens, the, public, liberal, political, conception, and, its, attendant, values, may, and, will, be, affirmed, publicly, in, judicial, opinions, and, presidential, addresses, for, example, but, its, deep, justifications, will, not, the, task, of, justification, falls, to, what, rawls, called, the, reasonable, comprehensive, doctrines, and, the, citizens, who, subscribe, to, them, a, reasonable, catholic, will, justify, the, liberal, values, one, way, a, reasonable, muslim, another, and, a, reasonable, secular, citizen, yet, another, way, one, may, illustrate, rawls, s, idea, using, a, venn, diagram, the, public, political, values, will, be, the, shared, space, upon, which, overlap, numerous, reasonable, comprehensive, doctrines, rawls, s, account, of, stability, presented, in, a, theory, of, justice, is, a, detailed, portrait, of, the, compatibility, of, one, kantian, comprehensive, doctrine, with, justice, as, fairness, his, hope, is, that, similar, accounts, may, be, presented, for, many, other, comprehensive, doctrines, this, is, rawls, s, famous, notion, of, an, overlapping, consensus, such, a, consensus, would, necessarily, exclude, some, doctrines, namely, those, that, are, unreasonable, and, so, one, may, wonder, what, rawls, has, to, say, about, such, doctrines, an, unreasonable, comprehensive, doctrine, is, unreasonable, in, the, sense, that, it, is, incompatible, with, the, duty, of, civility, this, is, simply, another, way, of, saying, that, an, unreasonable, doctrine, is, incompatible, with, the, fundamental, political, values, a, liberal, theory, of, justice, is, designed, to, safeguard, freedom, equality, and, fairness, so, one, answer, to, the, question, of, what, rawls, has, to, say, about, such, doctrines, is, nothing, for, one, thing, the, liberal, state, cannot, justify, itself, to, individuals, such, as, religious, fundamentalists, who, hold, to, such, doctrines, because, any, such, justification, would, as, has, been, noted, proceed, in, terms, of, controversial, moral, or, religious, commitments, that, are, excluded, from, the, public, political, forum, but, more, importantly, the, goal, of, the, rawlsian, project, is, primarily, to, determine, whether, or, not, the, liberal, conception, of, political, legitimacy, is, internally, coherent, and, this, project, is, carried, out, by, the, specification, of, what, sorts, of, reasons, persons, committed, to, liberal, values, are, permitted, to, use, in, their, dialogue, deliberations, and, arguments, with, one, another, about, political, matters, the, rawlsian, project, has, this, goal, to, the, exclusion, of, concern, with, justifying, liberal, values, to, those, not, already, committed, or, at, least, open, to, them, rawls, s, concern, is, with, whether, or, not, the, idea, of, political, legitimacy, fleshed, out, in, terms, of, the, duty, of, civility, and, mutual, justification, can, serve, as, a, viable, form, of, public, discourse, in, the, face, of, the, religious, and, moral, pluralism, of, modern, democratic, society, not, with, justifying, this, conception, of, political, legitimacy, in, the, first, place, rawls, also, modified, the, principles, of, justice, as, follows, with, the, first, principle, having, priority, over, the, second, and, the, first, half, of, the, second, having, priority, over, the, latter, half, these, principles, are, subtly, modified, from, the, principles, in, theory, the, first, principle, now, reads, equal, claim, instead, of, equal, right, and, he, also, replaces, the, phrase, system, of, basic, liberties, with, a, fully, adequate, scheme, of, equal, basic, rights, and, liberties, the, two, parts, of, the, second, principle, are, also, switched, so, that, the, difference, principle, becomes, the, latter, of, the, three, although, there, were, passing, comments, on, international, affairs, in, a, theory, of, justice, it, was, not, until, late, in, his, career, that, rawls, formulated, a, comprehensive, theory, of, international, politics, with, the, publication, of, the, law, of, peoples, he, claimed, there, that, well, ordered, peoples, could, be, either, liberal, or, decent, rawls, s, basic, distinction, in, international, politics, is, that, his, preferred, emphasis, on, a, society, of, peoples, is, separate, from, the, more, conventional, and, historical, discussion, of, international, politics, as, based, on, relationships, between, states, rawls, argued, that, the, legitimacy, of, a, liberal, international, order, is, contingent, on, tolerating, decent, peoples, which, differ, from, liberal, peoples, among, other, ways, in, that, they, might, have, state, religions, and, deny, adherents, of, minority, faiths, the, right, to, hold, positions, of, power, within, the, state, and, might, organize, political, participation, via, consultation, hierarchies, rather, than, elections, however, no, well, ordered, peoples, may, violate, human, rights, or, behave, in, an, externally, aggressive, manner, peoples, that, fail, to, meet, the, criteria, of, liberal, or, decent, peoples, are, referred, to, as, outlaw, states, societies, burdened, by, unfavorable, conditions, or, benevolent, absolutisms, depending, on, their, particular, failings, such, peoples, do, not, have, the, right, to, mutual, respect, and, toleration, possessed, by, liberal, and, decent, peoples, rawls, s, views, on, global, distributive, justice, as, they, were, expressed, in, this, work, surprised, many, of, his, fellow, egalitarian, liberals, for, example, charles, beitz, had, previously, written, a, study, that, argued, for, the, application, of, rawls, s, difference, principles, globally, rawls, denied, that, his, principles, should, be, so, applied, partly, on, the, grounds, that, a, world, state, does, not, exist, and, would, not, be, stable, this, notion, has, been, challenged, as, a, comprehensive, system, of, global, governance, has, arisen, amongst, others, in, the, form, of, the, bretton, woods, system, that, serves, to, distribute, primary, social, goods, between, human, beings, it, has, thus, been, argued, that, a, cosmopolitan, application, of, the, theory, of, justice, as, fairness, is, the, more, reasonable, alternative, to, the, application, of, the, law, of, peoples, as, it, would, be, more, legitimate, towards, all, persons, over, whom, political, coercive, power, is, exercised, according, to, rawls, however, nation, states, unlike, citizens, were, self, sufficient, in, the, cooperative, enterprises, that, constitute, domestic, societies, although, rawls, recognized, that, aid, should, be, given, to, governments, which, are, unable, to, protect, human, rights, for, economic, reasons, he, claimed, that, the, purpose, for, this, aid, is, not, to, achieve, an, eventual, state, of, global, equality, but, rather, only, to, ensure, that, these, societies, could, maintain, liberal, or, decent, political, institutions, he, argued, among, other, things, that, continuing, to, give, aid, indefinitely, would, see, nations, with, industrious, populations, subsidize, those, with, idle, populations, and, would, create, a, moral, hazard, problem, where, governments, could, spend, irresponsibly, in, the, knowledge, that, they, will, be, bailed, out, by, those, nations, who, had, spent, responsibly, rawls, s, discussion, of, non, ideal, theory, on, the, other, hand, included, a, condemnation, of, bombing, civilians, and, of, the, american, bombing, of, german, and, japanese, cities, in, world, war, ii, as, well, as, discussions, of, immigration, and, nuclear, proliferation, he, also, detailed, here, the, ideal, of, the, statesman, a, political, leader, who, looks, to, the, next, generation, and, promotes, international, harmony, even, in, the, face, of, significant, domestic, pressure, to, act, otherwise, rawls, also, controversially, claimed, that, violations, of, human, rights, can, legitimize, military, intervention, in, the, violating, states, though, he, also, expressed, the, hope, that, such, societies, could, be, induced, to, reform, peacefully, by, the, good, example, of, liberal, and, decent, peoples, despite, the, exacting, academic, tone, of, rawls, s, writing, and, his, reclusive, personality, his, philosophical, work, has, exerted, an, enormous, impact, on, not, only, contemporary, moral, and, political, philosophy, but, also, public, political, discourse, during, the, student, protests, at, tiananmen, square, in, 1989, copies, of, a, theory, of, justice, were, brandished, by, protesters, in, the, face, of, government, officials, despite, being, approximately, 600, pages, long, over, 300, 000, copies, of, that, book, have, been, sold, stimulating, critical, responses, from, utilitarian, feminist, conservative, libertarian, catholic, communitarian, marxist, and, green, scholars, although, having, a, profound, influence, on, theories, of, distributive, justice, both, in, theory, and, in, practice, the, generally, anti, meritocratic, sentiment, of, rawls, s, thinking, has, not, been, widely, accepted, by, the, political, left, he, consistently, held, the, view, that, naturally, developed, skills, and, endowments, could, not, be, neatly, distinguished, from, inherited, ones, and, that, neither, could, be, used, to, justify, moral, desert, instead, he, held, the, view, that, individuals, could, legitimately, expect, entitlements, to, the, earning, of, income, or, development, of, abilities, based, on, institutional, arrangements, this, aspect, of, rawls, s, work, has, been, instrumental, in, the, development, of, such, ideas, as, luck, egalitarianism, and, unconditional, basic, income, which, have, themselves, been, criticized, the, strictly, egalitarian, quality, of, rawls, s, second, principle, of, justice, has, called, into, question, the, type, of, equality, that, fair, societies, ought, to, embody, in, a, 2008, national, survey, of, political, theorists, based, on, 1, 086, responses, from, professors, at, accredited, four, year, colleges, and, universities, in, the, united, states, rawls, was, voted, first, on, the, list, of, scholars, who, have, had, the, greatest, impact, on, political, theory, in, the, past, 20, years, charles, taylor, alasdair, macintyre, michael, sandel, and, michael, walzer, produced, a, range, of, critical, responses, contesting, the, universalist, basis, of, rawls, original, position, while, these, criticisms, which, emphasize, the, cultural, and, social, roots, of, normative, political, principles, are, typically, described, as, communitarian, critiques, of, rawlsian, liberalism, none, of, their, authors, identified, with, philosophical, communitarianism, in, his, later, works, rawls, attempted, to, reconcile, his, theory, of, justice, with, the, possibility, that, its, normative, foundations, may, not, be, universally, applicable, the, late, philosopher, g, a, cohen, along, with, political, scientist, jon, elster, and, john, roemer, used, rawls, s, writings, extensively, to, inaugurate, the, analytical, marxism, movement, in, the, 1980s, in, the, later, part, of, rawls, s, career, he, engaged, with, the, scholarly, work, of, j, rgen, habermas, see, habermas, rawls, debate, habermas, s, reading, of, rawls, led, to, an, appreciation, of, rawls, s, work, and, other, analytical, philosophers, by, the, frankfurt, school, of, critical, theory, and, many, of, habermas, s, own, students, and, associates, were, expected, to, be, familiar, with, rawls, by, the, late, 1980s, the, leibniz, prize, winning, political, philosopher, rainer, forst, was, advised, by, both, by, rawls, and, habermas, in, completing, his, phd, axel, honneth, fabian, freyenhagen, and, james, gordon, finlayson, have, also, drawn, on, rawls, s, work, in, comparison, to, habermas, philosopher, eva, kittay, has, extended, the, work, of, john, rawls, to, address, the, concerns, of, women, and, cognitively, disabled, people, john, rawls, is, featured, as, the, protagonist, of, a, theory, of, justice, the, musical, an, award, nominated, musical, comedy, which, premiered, at, oxford, in, 2013, and, was, revived, for, the, edinburgh, fringe, festival
