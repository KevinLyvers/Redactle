constantin, rezachevici, said, vlad, was, most, probably, buried, in, the, first, church, of, the, comana, monastery, which, had, been, established, by, vlad, and, was, near, the, battlefield, where, he, was, killed, vlad, had, two, wives, according, to, modern, specialists, his, first, wife, may, have, been, an, illegitimate, daughter, of, john, hunyadi, according, to, historian, alexandru,

vlad, s, brutal, acts, began, circulating, during, his, lifetime, after, his, arrest, courtiers, of, matthias, corvinus, promoted, their, spread, the, papal, legate, niccolo, modrussiense, had, already, written, about, such, stories, to, pope, pius, ii, in, 1462, two, years, later, the, pope, included, them, in, his, commentaries, meistersinger, michael, beheim, wrote, a, lengthy, poem, about, vlad, s, deeds, allegedly, based, on, his, conversation, with, a, catholic, monk, who, had, managed, to, escape, from, vlad, s, prison, the, poem, called, von, ainem, wutrich, der, heis, trakle, waida, von, der, walachei, story, of, a, despot, called, dracula, voievod, of, wallachia, was, performed, at, the, court, of, frederick, iii, holy, roman, emperor, in, wiener, neustadt, during, the, winter, of, 1463, according, to, one, of, beheim, s, stories, vlad, had, two, monks, impaled, to, assist, them, to, go, to, heaven, also, ordering, the, impalement, of, their, donkey, because, it, began, braying, after, its, masters, death, beheim, also, accused, vlad, of, duplicity, stating, that, vlad, had, promised, support, to, both, matthias, corvinus, and, mehmed, ii, but, did, not, keep, the, promise, in, 1475, gabriele, rangoni, bishop, of, eger, and, a, former, papal, legate, understood, that, vlad, had, been, imprisoned, because, of, his, cruelty, rangoni, also, recorded, the, rumour, that, while, in, prison, vlad, caught, rats, to, cut, them, up, into, pieces, or, stuck, them, on, small, pieces, of, wood, because, he, was, unable, to, forget, his, wickedness, antonio, bonfini, also, recorded, anecdotes, about, vlad, in, his, historia, pannonica, around, 1495, bonfini, wanted, to, justify, both, the, removal, and, the, restoration, of, vlad, by, matthias, he, described, vlad, as, a, man, of, unheard, cruelty, and, justice, bonfini, s, stories, about, vlad, were, repeated, in, sebastian, m, nster, s, cosmography, m, nster, also, recorded, vlad, s, reputation, for, tyrannical, justice, turkish, messengers, came, to, to, pay, respects, but, refused, to, take, off, their, turbans, according, to, their, ancient, custom, whereupon, he, strengthened, their, custom, by, nailing, their, turbans, to, their, heads, with, three, spikes, so, that, they, could, not, take, them, off, works, containing, the, stories, about, vlad, s, cruelty, were, published, in, low, german, in, the, holy, roman, empire, before, 1480, the, stories, were, allegedly, written, in, the, early, 1460s, because, they, describe, vlad, s, campaign, across, the, danube, in, early, 1462, but, they, do, not, refer, to, mehmed, ii, s, invasion, of, wallachia, in, june, of, the, same, year, they, provide, a, detailed, narration, of, the, conflicts, between, vlad, and, the, transylvanian, saxons, showing, that, they, originated, in, the, literary, minds, of, the, saxons, the, stories, about, vlad, s, plundering, raids, in, transylvania, were, clearly, based, on, an, eyewitness, account, because, they, contain, accurate, details, including, the, lists, of, the, churches, destroyed, by, vlad, and, the, dates, of, the, raids, they, describe, vlad, as, a, demented, psychopath, a, sadist, a, gruesome, murderer, a, masochist, worse, than, caligula, and, nero, however, the, stories, emphasizing, vlad, s, cruelty, are, to, be, treated, with, caution, because, his, brutal, acts, were, very, probably, exaggerated, or, even, invented, by, the, saxons, the, invention, of, movable, type, printing, contributed, to, the, popularity, of, the, stories, about, vlad, making, them, one, of, the, first, bestsellers, in, europe, to, enhance, sales, they, were, published, in, books, with, woodcuts, on, their, title, pages, that, depicted, horrific, scenes, for, instance, the, editions, published, in, nuremberg, in, 1499, and, in, strasbourg, in, 1500, depict, vlad, dining, at, a, table, surrounded, by, dead, or, dying, people, on, poles, had, a, big, copper, cauldron, built, and, put, a, lid, made, of, wood, with, holes, in, it, on, top, he, put, the, people, in, the, cauldron, and, put, their, heads, in, the, holes, and, fastened, them, there, then, he, filled, it, with, water, and, set, a, fire, under, it, and, let, the, people, cry, their, eyes, out, until, they, were, boiled, to, death, and, then, he, invented, frightening, terrible, unheard, of, tortures, he, ordered, that, women, be, impaled, together, with, their, suckling, babies, on, the, same, stake, the, babies, fought, for, their, lives, at, their, mother, s, breasts, until, they, died, then, he, had, the, women, s, breasts, cut, off, and, put, the, babies, inside, headfirst, thus, he, had, them, impaled, together, there, are, more, than, twenty, manuscripts, written, between, the, 15th, and, 18th, centuries, which, preserved, the, text, of, the, skazanie, o, drakule, voievode, the, tale, about, voivode, dracula, the, manuscripts, were, written, in, russian, but, they, copied, a, text, that, had, originally, been, recorded, in, a, south, slavic, language, because, they, contain, expressions, alien, to, the, russian, language, but, used, in, south, slavic, idioms, such, as, diavol, for, evil, the, original, text, was, written, in, buda, between, 1482, and, 1486, the, nineteen, anecdotes, in, the, skazanie, are, longer, than, the, german, stories, about, vlad, they, are, a, mixture, of, fact, and, fiction, according, to, historian, raymond, t, mcnally, almost, half, of, the, anecdotes, emphasize, like, the, german, stories, vlad, s, brutality, but, they, also, underline, that, his, cruelty, enabled, him, to, strengthen, the, central, government, in, wallachia, for, instance, the, skazanie, writes, of, a, golden, cup, that, nobody, dared, to, steal, at, a, fountain, because, vlad, hated, stealing, so, violently, that, anybody, who, caused, any, evil, or, robbery, did, not, live, long, thereby, promoting, public, order, and, the, german, story, about, vlad, s, campaign, against, ottoman, territory, underlined, his, cruel, acts, while, the, skazanie, emphasized, his, successful, diplomacy, calling, him, zlomudry, or, evil, wise, on, the, other, hand, the, skazanie, sharply, criticized, vlad, for, his, conversion, to, catholicism, attributing, his, death, to, this, apostasy, some, elements, of, the, anecdotes, were, later, added, to, russian, stories, about, ivan, the, terrible, of, russia, the, mass, murders, that, vlad, carried, out, indiscriminately, and, brutally, would, most, likely, amount, to, acts, of, genocide, and, war, crimes, by, current, standards, romanian, defense, minister, ioan, mircea, pa, cu, asserted, that, vlad, would, have, been, condemned, for, crimes, against, humanity, had, he, been, put, on, trial, at, nuremberg, the, cantacuzino, chronicle, was, the, first, romanian, historical, work, to, record, a, tale, about, vlad, the, impaler, narrating, the, impalement, of, the, old, boyars, of, t, rgovi, te, for, the, murder, of, his, brother, dan, the, chronicle, added, that, vlad, forced, the, young, boyars, and, their, wives, and, children, to, build, the, poenari, castle, the, legend, of, the, poenari, castle, was, mentioned, in, 1747, by, neofit, i, metropolitan, of, ungro, wallachia, who, complemented, it, with, the, story, of, me, terul, manole, who, allegedly, walled, in, his, bride, to, prevent, the, crumbling, of, the, walls, of, the, castle, during, the, building, project, in, the, early, 20th, century, constantin, r, dulescu, codin, a, teacher, in, muscel, county, where, the, castle, was, situated, published, a, local, legend, about, vlad, s, letter, of, grant, written, on, rabbit, skin, for, the, villagers, who, had, helped, him, to, escape, from, poenari, castle, to, transylvania, during, the, ottoman, invasion, of, wallachia, in, other, villages, of, the, region, the, donation, is, attributed, to, the, legendary, radu, negru, r, dulescu, codin, recorded, further, local, legends, some, of, which, are, also, known, from, the, german, and, slavic, stories, about, vlad, suggesting, that, the, latter, stories, preserved, oral, tradition, for, instance, the, tales, about, the, burning, of, the, lazy, the, poor, and, the, lame, at, vlad, s, order, and, the, execution, of, the, woman, who, had, made, her, husband, too, short, a, shirt, can, also, be, found, among, the, german, and, slavic, anecdotes, the, peasants, telling, the, tales, knew, that, vlad, s, sobriquet, was, connected, to, the, frequent, impalements, during, his, reign, but, they, said, only, such, cruel, acts, could, secure, public, order, in, wallachia, most, romanian, artists, have, regarded, vlad, as, a, just, ruler, and, a, realistic, tyrant, who, punished, criminals, and, executed, unpatriotic, boyars, to, strengthen, the, central, government, ion, budai, deleanu, wrote, the, first, romanian, epic, poem, focusing, on, him, deleanu, s, iganiada, gypsy, epic, which, was, published, only, in, 1875, almost, a, century, after, its, composition, presented, vlad, as, a, hero, fighting, against, the, boyars, ottomans, strigoi, or, vampires, and, other, evil, spirits, at, the, head, of, an, army, of, gypsies, and, angels, the, poet, dimitrie, bolintineanu, emphasized, vlad, s, triumphs, in, his, battles, of, the, romanians, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, he, regarded, vlad, as, a, reformer, whose, acts, of, violence, were, necessary, to, prevent, the, despotism, of, the, boyars, one, of, the, greatest, romanian, poets, mihai, eminescu, dedicated, a, historic, ballad, the, third, letter, to, the, valiant, princes, of, wallachia, including, vlad, he, urges, vlad, to, return, from, the, grave, and, to, annihilate, the, enemies, of, the, romanian, nation, you, must, come, o, dread, impaler, confound, them, to, your, care, split, them, in, two, partitions, here, the, fools, the, rascals, there, shove, them, into, two, enclosures, from, the, broad, daylight, enisle, em, then, set, fire, to, the, prison, and, the, lunatic, asylum, in, the, early, 1860s, the, painter, theodor, aman, depicted, the, meeting, of, vlad, and, the, ottoman, envoys, showing, the, envoys, fear, of, the, wallachian, ruler, since, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, romanian, historians, have, treated, vlad, as, one, of, the, greatest, romanian, rulers, emphasizing, his, fight, for, the, independence, of, the, romanian, lands, even, vlad, s, acts, of, cruelty, were, often, represented, as, rational, acts, serving, national, interest, alexandru, dimitrie, xenopol, was, one, of, the, first, historians, to, emphasize, that, vlad, could, only, stop, the, internal, fights, of, the, boyar, parties, through, his, acts, of, terror, constantin, c, giurescu, remarked, the, tortures, and, executions, which, ordered, were, not, out, of, caprice, but, always, had, a, reason, and, very, often, a, reason, of, state, ioan, bogdan, was, one, of, the, few, romanian, historians, who, did, not, accept, this, heroic, image, in, his, work, published, in, 1896, vlad, epe, and, the, german, and, russian, narratives, he, concluded, that, the, romanians, should, be, ashamed, of, vlad, instead, of, presenting, him, as, a, model, of, courage, and, patriotism, according, to, an, opinion, poll, conducted, in, 1999, 4, 1, of, the, participants, chose, vlad, the, impaler, as, one, of, the, most, important, historical, personalities, who, have, influenced, the, destiny, of, the, romanians, for, the, better, the, stories, about, vlad, made, him, the, best, known, medieval, ruler, of, the, romanian, lands, in, europe, however, bram, stoker, s, dracula, which, was, published, in, 1897, was, the, first, book, to, make, a, connection, between, dracula, and, vampirism, stoker, had, his, attention, drawn, to, the, blood, sucking, vampires, of, romanian, folklore, by, emily, gerard, s, article, about, transylvanian, superstitions, published, in, 1885, his, limited, knowledge, about, the, medieval, history, of, wallachia, came, from, william, wilkinson, s, book, entitled, account, of, the, principalities, of, wallachia, and, moldavia, with, political, observations, relative, to, them, published, in, 1820, stoker, apparently, did, not, know, much, about, vlad, the, impaler, certainly, not, enough, for, us, to, say, that, vlad, was, the, inspiration, for, count, dracula, according, to, elizabeth, miller, for, instance, stoker, wrote, that, dracula, had, been, of, sz, kely, origin, only, because, he, knew, about, both, attila, the, hun, s, destructive, campaigns, and, the, alleged, hunnic, origin, of, the, sz, kelys, stoker, s, main, source, wilkinson, who, accepted, the, reliability, of, the, german, stories, described, vlad, as, a, wicked, man, actually, stoker, s, working, papers, for, his, book, contain, no, references, to, the, historical, figure, the, name, of, the, character, being, named, in, all, drafts, but, the, later, ones, count, wampyr, consequently, stoker, borrowed, the, name, and, scraps, of, miscellaneous, information, about, the, history, of, wallachia, when, writing, his, book, about, count, dracula, pope, pius, ii, s, legate, niccol, modrussa, painted, the, only, extant, description, of, vlad, whom, he, had, met, in, buda, a, copy, of, vlad, s, portrait, has,
