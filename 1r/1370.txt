missouri, area, throughout, the, late, 1860s, and, early, 1870s, the, events, between, 1866, and, 1868, mark, a, historically, debated, period, of, sitting, bull, s, life, according, to, historian, stanley, vestal, who, conducted, interviews, with, surviving, hunkpapa, in, 1930, sitting, bull, was, made, supreme, chief, of, the, whole, sioux, nation, at, this, time, but, historians, and, ethnologists, later, refuted, this, since, lakota, society, was, highly, decentralized, lakota, bands, and, their, elders, made, individual, decisions, including, whether, or, not, to, wage, war, sitting, bull, s, band, of, hunkpapa, continued, to, attack, migrating, parties, and, forts, in, the, late, 1860s, in, 1871, the, northern, pacific, railway, conducted, a, survey, for, a, route, across, the, northern, plains, directly, through, hunkpapa, lands, it, encountered, stiff, lakota, resistance, the, same, railway, people, returned, the, following, year, accompanied, by, federal, troops, sitting, bull, and, the, hunkpapa, attacked, the, survey, party, which, was, forced, to, turn, back, in, 1873, the, military, accompaniment, for, the, surveyors, was, increased, again, but, sitting, bull, s, forces, resisted, the, survey, most, vigorously, the, panic, of, 1873, forced, the, northern, pacific, railway, s, backers, such, as, jay, cooke, into, bankruptcy, which, halted, construction, of, the, railroad, through, lakota, dakota, and, nakota, territory, after, the, 1848, discovery, of, gold, in, the, sierra, nevada, and, dramatic, gains, in, new, wealth, from, it, other, men, became, interested, in, the, potential, for, gold, mining, in, the, black, hills, in, 1874, lt, col, george, armstrong, custer, led, a, military, expedition, from, fort, abraham, lincoln, near, bismarck, to, explore, the, black, hills, for, gold, and, to, determine, a, suitable, location, for, a, military, fort, in, the, hills, custer, s, announcement, of, gold, in, the, black, hills, triggered, the, black, hills, gold, rush, tensions, increased, between, the, lakota, and, european, americans, seeking, to, move, into, the, black, hills, although, sitting, bull, did, not, attack, custer, s, expedition, in, 1874, the, u, s, government, was, increasingly, pressured, by, citizens, to, open, the, black, hills, to, mining, and, settlement, failing, in, an, attempt, to, negotiate, a, purchase, or, lease, of, the, hills, the, government, in, washington, had, to, find, a, way, around, the, promise, to, protect, the, sioux, in, their, land, as, specified, in, the, 1868, treaty, of, fort, laramie, it, was, alarmed, at, reports, of, sioux, depredations, some, of, which, were, encouraged, by, sitting, bull, in, november, 1875, president, ulysses, s, grant, ordered, all, sioux, bands, outside, the, great, sioux, reservation, to, move, onto, the, reservation, knowing, that, not, all, would, likely, comply, as, of, february, 1, 1876, the, interior, department, certified, as, hostile, those, bands, who, continued, to, live, off, the, reservation, this, certification, allowed, the, military, to, pursue, sitting, bull, and, other, lakota, bands, as, hostiles, based, on, tribal, oral, histories, historian, margot, liberty, theorizes, that, many, lakota, bands, allied, with, the, cheyenne, during, the, plains, wars, because, they, thought, the, other, nation, was, under, attack, by, the, u, s, given, this, connection, she, suggests, the, major, war, should, have, been, called, the, great, cheyenne, war, since, 1860, the, northern, cheyenne, had, led, several, battles, among, the, plains, indians, before, 1876, the, u, s, army, had, destroyed, seven, cheyenne, camps, more, than, those, of, any, other, nation, other, historians, such, as, robert, m, utley, and, jerome, greene, also, use, lakota, oral, testimony, but, they, have, concluded, that, the, lakota, coalition, of, which, sitting, bull, was, the, ostensible, head, was, the, primary, target, of, the, federal, government, s, pacification, campaign, during, the, period, 1868, 1876, sitting, bull, developed, into, one, of, the, most, important, native, american, political, leaders, after, the, treaty, of, fort, laramie, 1868, and, the, creation, of, the, great, sioux, reservation, many, traditional, sioux, warriors, such, as, red, cloud, of, the, oglala, and, spotted, tail, of, the, brul, moved, to, reside, permanently, on, the, reservations, they, were, largely, dependent, for, subsistence, on, the, u, s, indian, agencies, many, other, chiefs, including, members, of, sitting, bull, s, hunkpapa, band, such, as, gall, at, times, lived, temporarily, at, the, agencies, they, needed, the, supplies, at, a, time, when, white, encroachment, and, the, depletion, of, buffalo, herds, reduced, their, resources, and, challenged, native, american, independence, in, 1875, the, northern, cheyenne, hunkpapa, oglala, sans, arc, and, minneconjou, camped, together, for, a, sun, dance, with, both, the, cheyenne, medicine, man, white, bull, or, ice, and, sitting, bull, in, association, this, ceremonial, alliance, preceded, their, fighting, together, in, 1876, sitting, bull, had, a, major, revelation, at, the, climactic, moment, sitting, bull, intoned, the, great, spirit, has, given, our, enemies, to, us, we, are, to, destroy, them, we, do, not, know, who, they, are, they, may, be, soldiers, ice, too, observed, no, one, then, knew, who, the, enemy, were, of, what, tribe, they, were, soon, to, find, out, sitting, bull, s, refusal, to, adopt, any, dependence, on, the, u, s, government, meant, that, at, times, he, and, his, small, band, of, warriors, lived, isolated, on, the, plains, when, native, americans, were, threatened, by, the, united, states, numerous, members, from, various, sioux, bands, and, other, tribes, such, as, the, northern, cheyenne, came, to, sitting, bull, s, camp, his, reputation, for, strong, medicine, developed, as, he, continued, to, evade, the, european, americans, after, the, ultimatum, on, january, 1, 1876, when, the, u, s, army, began, to, track, down, as, hostiles, those, sioux, and, others, living, off, the, reservation, native, americans, gathered, at, sitting, bull, s, camp, he, took, an, active, role, in, encouraging, this, unity, camp, he, sent, scouts, to, the, reservations, to, recruit, warriors, and, told, the, hunkpapa, to, share, supplies, with, those, native, americans, who, joined, them, an, example, of, his, generosity, was, sitting, bull, s, provision, for, wooden, leg, s, northern, cheyenne, tribe, they, had, been, impoverished, by, captain, reynolds, march, 17, 1876, attack, and, fled, to, sitting, bull, s, camp, for, safety, over, the, course, of, the, first, half, of, 1876, sitting, bull, s, camp, continually, expanded, as, natives, joined, him, for, safety, in, numbers, his, leadership, had, attracted, warriors, and, families, creating, an, extensive, village, estimated, at, more, than, 10, 000, people, lt, col, custer, came, across, this, large, camp, on, june, 25, 1876, sitting, bull, did, not, take, a, direct, military, role, in, the, ensuing, battle, instead, he, acted, as, a, spiritual, leader, a, week, prior, to, the, attack, he, had, performed, the, sun, dance, in, which, he, fasted, and, sacrificed, over, 100, pieces, of, flesh, from, his, arms, on, june, 25, 1876, custer, s, scouts, discovered, sitting, bull, s, camp, along, the, little, big, horn, river, known, as, the, greasy, grass, river, to, the, lakota, after, being, ordered, to, attack, custer, s, 7th,

surrounding, and, laying, siege, to, the, other, two, battalions, led, by, reno, and, benteen, the, native, americans, victory, celebrations, were, short, lived, public, shock, and, outrage, at, custer, s, defeat, and, death, and, the, government, s, understanding, of, the, military, capability, of, the, remaining, sioux, led, the, department, of, war, to, assign, thousands, more, soldiers, to, the, area, over, the, next, year, the, new, american, military, forces, pursued, the, lakota, forcing, many, of, the, native, americans, to, surrender, sitting, bull, refused, to, do, so, and, in, may, 1877, led, his, band, across, the, border, into, the, north, west, territories, canada, he, remained, in, exile, for, four, years, near, wood, mountain, refusing, a, pardon, and, the, chance, to,

peace, with, the, blackfeet, nation, and, crowfoot, as, an, advocate, for, peace, himself, crowfoot, eagerly, accepted, the, tobacco, peace, offering, sitting, bull, was, so, impressed, by, crowfoot, that, he, named, one, of, his, sons, after, him, sitting, bull, and, his, people, stayed, in, canada, for, four, years, due, to, the, smaller, size, of, the, buffalo, herds, in, canada, sitting, bull, and, his, men, found, it, difficult, to, find, enough, food, to, feed, their, starving, people, sitting, bull, s, presence, in, the, country, led, to, increased, tensions, between, the, canadian, and, the, united, states, governments, before, sitting, bull, left, canada, he, may, have, visited, walsh, for, a, final, time, and, left, a, ceremonial, headdress, as, a, memento, hunger, and,
