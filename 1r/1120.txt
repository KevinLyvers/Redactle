reign, following, a, failed, invasion, of, iraq, in, 686, abd, al, malik, focused, on, securing, syria, before, making, further, attempts, to, conquer, the, greater, part, of, the, caliphate, from,

peaceful, and, prosperous, consolidation, of, power, in, a, significant, departure, from, his, predecessors, rule, over, the, caliphate, s, provinces, was, centralized, under, abd, al, malik, following, the, elimination, of, his, rivals, gradually, loyalist, arab, troops, from, syria, were, tasked, with, maintaining, order, in, the, provinces, as, dependence, on, less, reliable, local,

currency, in, place, of, byzantine, and, sasanian, coinage, and, the, establishment, of, arabic, as, the, language, of, the, bureaucracy, in, place, of, greek, and, persian, in, syria, and, iraq, respectively, his, muslim, upbringing, the, conflicts, with, external, and, local, christian, forces, and, rival, claimants, to, islamic, leadership, all, influenced, abd, al, malik, s, efforts, to, prescribe, a, distinctly, islamic, character, to, the, umayyad, state, another, manifestation, of, this, initiative, was, his, founding, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, the, earliest, archaeologically, attested, religious, monument, built, by, a, muslim, ruler, and, the, possessor, of, the, earliest, epigraphic, proclamations, of, islam, and, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, the, foundations, established, by, abd, al, malik, enabled, his, son, and, successor, al, walid, i, r, 705, 715, who, largely, maintained, his, father, s, policies, to, oversee, the, umayyad, caliphate, s,

before, they, embraced, islam, in, 630, not, long, after, the, quraysh, came, to, dominate, muslim, politics, abd, al, malik, belonged, to, the, first, generation, of, born, muslims, and, his, upbringing, in, medina, islam, s, political, center, at, the, time, was, generally, described, as, pious, and, rigorous, by, the, traditional, muslim, sources, he, took, a, deep, interest, in, islam, and, possibly, memorized, the, qur, an, abd, al, malik, s, father, was, a, senior, aide, of, their, umayyad, kinsman, caliph, uthman, r, 644, 656, in, 656, abd, al, malik, witnessed, uthman, s, assassination, in, medina, an, event, had, a, lasting, effect, on, him, and, contributed, to, his, distrust, of, the, townspeople, of, medina, according, to, the, historian, a, a, dixon, six, years, later, abd, al, malik, distinguished, himself, in, a, campaign, against, the, byzantines, as, commander, of, a, medinese, naval, unit, he, was, appointed, to, the, role, by, his, distant, cousin, caliph, mu, awiya, i, r, 661, 680, founder, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, afterward, he, returned, to, medina, where, he, operated, under, his, father, who, had, become, governor, of, the, city, as, the, k, tib, secretary, of, medina, s, d, w, n, bureaucracy, as, with, the, rest, of, the, umayyads, in, the, hejaz, abd, al, malik, lacked, close, ties, with, mu, awiya, who, ruled, from, his, power, base, in, damascus, in, syria, mu, awiya, belonged, to, the, sufyanid, line, of, the, umayyad, clan, while, abd, al, malik, belonged, to, the, larger, abu, al, as, line, when, a, revolt, broke, out, in, medina, in, 683, against, mu, awiya, s, son, and, successor, caliph, yazid, i, r, 680, 683, the, umayyads, including, abd, al, malik, were, expelled, from, the, city, the, revolt, was, part, of, the, wider, anti, umayyad, rebellion, that, became, known, as, the, second, muslim, civil, war, on, the, way, to, the, umayyad, capital, in, syria, abd, al, malik, encountered, the, army, of, muslim, ibn, uqba, who, had, been, sent, by, yazid, to, subdue, the, rebels, in, medina, he, provided, ibn, uqba, with, intelligence, about, medina, s, defenses, the, rebels, were, defeated, at, the, battle, of, al, harra, in, august, 683, but, the, army, withdrew, to, syria, after, yazid, s, death, later, that, year, the, deaths, of, yazid, and, his, successor, his, son, mu, awiya, ii, in, relatively, quick, succession, in, 683, 684, precipitated, a, leadership, vacuum, in, damascus, and, the, consequent, collapse, of, umayyad, authority, across, the, caliphate, most, provinces, declared, their, allegiance, to, the, rival, mecca, based, caliph, abd, allah, ibn, al, zubayr, in, parts, of, syria, older, established, arab, tribes, who, had, secured, a, privileged, position, in, the, umayyad, court, and, military, in, particular, the, banu, kalb, scrambled, to, preserve, umayyad, rule, marwan, and, his, family, including, abd, al, malik, had, since, relocated, to, syria, where, marwan, met, the, pro, umayyad, stalwart, ubayd, allah, ibn, ziyad, who, had, just, been, expelled, from, his, governorship, in, iraq, ibn, ziyad, persuaded, marwan, to, forward, his, candidacy, for, the, caliphate, during, a, summit, of, pro, umayyad, tribes, in, jabiya, hosted, by, the, kalbite, chieftain, ibn, bahdal, the, tribal, nobility, elected, marwan, as, caliph, and, the, latter, became, dependent, on, the, kalb, and, its, allies, who, collectively, became, known, as, the, yaman, in, reference, to, their, ostensibly, shared, south, arabian, yamani, roots, their, power, came, at, the, expense, of, the, qaysi, tribes, relative, newcomers, who, had, come, to, dominate, northern, syria, and, the, jazira, under, mu, awiya, i, and, had, defected, to, ibn, al, zubayr, the, qays, were, routed, by, marwan, and, his, yamani, backers, at, the, battle, of, marj, rahit, in, 684, leading, to, a, long, standing, blood, feud, and, rivalry, between, the, two, tribal, coalitions, abd, al, malik, did, not, participate, in, the, battle, on, religious, grounds, according, to, the, contemporary, poems, compiled, in, the, anthology, of, abu, tammam, d, 845, abd, al, malik, was, a, close, adviser, of, his, father, he, was, headquartered, in, damascus, and, became, its, deputy, governor, during, marwan, s, expedition, to, conquer, zubayrid, egypt, in, late, 684, upon, the, caliph, s, return, in, 685, he, held, a, council, in, sinnabra, where, he, appointed, abd, al, malik, governor, of, palestine, and, designated, him, as, his, chosen, successor, to, be, followed, by, abd, al, malik, s, brother, abd, al, aziz, this, designation, abrogated, the, succession, arrangements, reached, in, jabiya, which, stipulated, yazid, s, son, khalid, would, succeed, marwan, followed, by, another, umayyad, the, former, governor, of, medina, amr, ibn, sa, id, al, ashdaq, nonetheless, marwan, secured, the, oaths, of, allegiance, to, abd, al, malik, from, the, yamani, nobility, while, the, historian, gerald, hawting, notes, that, abd, al, malik, was, nominated, despite, his, relative, lack, of, political, experience, dixon, maintains, he, was, chosen, because, of, his, political, ability, and, his, knowledge, of, statecraft, and, provincial, administration, as, indicated, by, his, gradual, advance, in, holding, important, posts, from, an, early, age, marwan, died, in, april, 685, and, abd, al, malik, s, accession, as, caliph, was, peacefully, managed, by, the, yamani, nobles, he, was, proclaimed, caliph, in, jerusalem, according, to, a, report, by, the, 9th, century, historian, khalifa, ibn, khayyat, which, the, modern, historian, amikam, elad, considers, to, be, seemingly, reliable, at, the, time, of, his, accession, critical, posts, were, held, by, members, of, abd, al, malik, s, family, his, brother, muhammad, was, charged, with, suppressing, the, qaysi, tribes, while, abd, al, aziz, maintained, peace, and, stability, as, governor, of, egypt, until, his, death, in, 705, during, the, early, years, of, his, reign, abd, al, malik, heavily, relied, on, the, yamani, nobles, of, syria, including, ibn, bahdal, al, kalbi, and, rawh, ibn, zinba, al, judhami, who, played, key, roles, in, his, administration, the, latter, served, as, the, equivalent, to, the, chief, minister, or, waz, r, of, the, later, abbasid, caliphs, furthermore, a, yamani, always, headed, abd, al, malik, s, shur, a, elite, security, retinue, the, first, to, hold, the, post, was, yazid, ibn, abi, kabsha, al, saksaki, and, he, was, followed, by, another, yamani, ka, b, ibn, hamid, al, ansi, the, caliph, s, aras, personal, guard, was, typically, led, by, a, mawl, non, arab, muslim, freedman, plural, maw, l, and, staffed, by, maw, l, though, umayyad, rule, had, been, restored, in, syria, and, egypt, abd, al, malik, faced, several, challenges, to, his, authority, most, provinces, of, the, caliphate, continued, to, recognize, ibn, al, zubayr, while, the, qaysi, tribes, regrouped, under, zufar, ibn, al, harith, al, kilabi, and, resisted, umayyad, rule, in, the, jazira, from, al, qarqisiya, a, euphrates, river, fortress, strategically, located, at, the, crossroads, of, syria, and, iraq, re, establishing, umayyad, rule, across, the, caliphate, was, the, major, priority, of, abd, al, malik, his, initial, focus, was, the, reconquest, of, iraq, the, caliphate, s, wealthiest, province, iraq, was, also, home, to, a, large, population, of, arab, tribesmen, the, group, from, which, the, caliphate, derived, the, bulk, of, its, troops, in, contrast, egypt, which, provided, significant, income, to, the, treasury, possessed, a, small, arab, community, and, was, thus, a, meager, source, of, troops, the, demand, for, soldiers, was, pressing, for, the, umayyads, as, the, backbone, of, their, military, the, syrian, army, remained, fractured, along, yamani, and, qaysi, lines, though, the, roughly, 6, 000, yamani, soldiers, of, abd, al, malik, s, predecessor, were, able, to, consolidate, the, umayyad, position, in, syria, they, were, too, few, to, reassert, authority, throughout, the, caliphate, ibn, ziyad, a, key, figure, in, the, establishment, of, marwanid, power, set, about, enlarging, the, army, by, recruiting, widely, among, the, arab, tribes, including, those, which, nominally, belonged, to, the, qays, faction, ibn, ziyad, had, been, tasked, by, abd, al, malik, s, father, with, the, reconquest, of, iraq, at, the, time, iraq, and, its, dependencies, were, split, between, the, pro, alid, forces, of, al, mukhtar, al, thaqafi, in, kufa, and, the, forces, of, ibn, al, zubayr, s, brother, mus, ab, in, basra, in, august, 686, ibn, ziyad, s, 60, 000, strong, army, was, routed, at, the, battle, of, khazir, and, he, was, slain, alongside, most, of, his, deputy, commanders, at, the, hands, of, al, mukhtar, s, much, smaller, pro, alid, force, led, by, ibrahim, ibn, al, ashtar, the, decisive, defeat, and, the, loss, of, ibn, ziyad, represented, a, major, setback, to, abd, al, malik, s, ambitions, in, iraq, he, refrained, from, further, major, campaigns, in, the, province, for, the, next, five, years, during, which, mus, ab, defeated, and, killed, al, mukhtar, and, his, supporters, and, became, iraq, s, sole, ruler, abd, al, malik, shifted, his, focus, to, consolidating, control, of, syria, his, efforts, in, iraq, had, been, undermined, by, the, qaysi, yamani, schism, when, a, qaysi, general, in, ibn, ziyad, s, army, umayr, ibn, al, hubab, al, sulami, defected, with, his, men, mid, battle, to, join, zufar, s, rebellion, umayr, s, subsequent, campaign, against, the, large, christian, banu, taghlib, tribe, in, the, jazira, sparked, a, series, of, tit, for, tat, raids, and, further, deepened, arab, tribal, divisions, the, previously, neutral, taghlib, throwing, in, its, lot, with, the, yaman, and, the, umayyads, the, taghlib, killed, umayr, in, 689, and, delivered, his, head, to, abd, al, malik, along, syria, s, northern, frontier, the, byzantines, had, been, on, the, offensive, since, the, failure, of, the, first, arab, siege, of, constantinople, in, 678, in, 679, a, thirty, year, peace, treaty, was, concluded, obliging, the, umayyads, to, pay, an, annual, tribute, of, 3, 000, gold, coins, 50, horses, and, 50, slaves, and, withdraw, their, troops, from, the, forward, bases, they, had, occupied, on, the, byzantine, coast, the, outbreak, of, the, muslim, civil, war, allowed, the, byzantine, emperor, constantine, iv, r, 668, 685, to, extort, territorial, concessions, and, enormous, tribute, from, the, umayyads, in, 685, the, emperor, led, his, army, to, mopsuestia, in, cilicia, and, prepared, to, cross, the, border, into, syria, where, the, mardaites, an, indigenous, christian, group, were, already, causing, considerable, trouble, with, his, own, position, insecure, abd, al, malik, concluded, a, treaty, whereby, he, would, pay, a, tribute, of, 1, 000, gold, coins, a, horse, and, a, slave, for, every, day, of, the, year, under, justinian, ii, r, 685, 695, 705, 711, the, byzantines, became, more, aggressive, though, it, is, unclear, whether, they, intervened, directly, as, reported, by, the, 9th, century, muslim, historian, al, baladhuri, or, used, the, mardaites, to, mount, pressure, on, the, muslims, mardaite, depredations, extended, throughout, syria, as, far, south, as, mount, lebanon, and, the, galilee, uplands, these, raids, culminated, with, the, short, lived, byzantine, recapture, of, antioch, in, 688, the, setbacks, in, iraq, had, weakened, the, umayyads, and, when, a, new, treaty, was, concluded, in, 689, it, greatly, favored, the, byzantines, according, to, the, 9th, century, byzantine, chronicler, theophanes, the, confessor, the, treaty, repeated, the, tribute, obligations, of, 685, but, now, byzantium, and, the, umayyads, established, a, condominium, over, cyprus, armenia, and, caucasian, iberia, modern, georgia, the, revenue, from, which, was, to, be, shared, between, the, two, states, in, exchange, byzantium, undertook, to, resettle, the, mardaites, in, its, own, territory, the, 12th, century, syriac, chronicler, michael, the, syrian, however, mentions, that, armenia, and, adharbayjan, were, to, come, under, full, byzantine, control, in, reality, as, the, latter, regions, were, not, held, by, the, umayyads, at, this, point, the, agreement, probably, indicates, a, carte, blanche, by, abd, al, malik, to, the, byzantines, to, proceed, against, zubayrid, forces, there, this, arrangement, suited, both, sides, abd, al, malik, weakened, his, opponent, s, forces, and, secured, his, northern, frontier, and, the, byzantines, gained, territory, and, reduced, the, power, of, the, side, that, was, apparently, winning, the, muslim, civil, war, about, 12, 000, mardaites, were, indeed, resettled, in, byzantium, but, many, remained, behind, only, submitting, to, the, umayyads, in, the, reign, of, al, walid, i, r, 705, 715, their, presence, disrupted, umayyad, supply, lines, and, obliged, them, to, permanently, keep, troops, on, standby, to, guard, against, their, raids, the, byzantine, counteroffensive, represented, the, first, challenge, against, a, muslim, power, by, a, people, defeated, in, the, early, muslim, conquests, moreover, the, mardaite, raids, demonstrated, to, abd, al, malik, and, his, successors, that, the, state, could, no, longer, depend, on, the, quiescence, of, syria, s, christian, majority, which, until, then, had, largely, refrained, from, rebellion, the, modern, historian, khalid, yahya, blankinship, described, the, treaty, of, 689, as, an, onerous, and, completely, humiliating, pact, and, surmised, that, abd, al, malik, s, ability, to, pay, the, annual, tribute, in, addition, to, financing, his, own, wartime, army, relied, on, treasury, funds, accrued, during, the, campaigns, of, his, sufyanid, predecessors, and, revenues, from, egypt, in, 689, 90, abd, al, malik, used, the, respite, from, the, truce, to, initiate, a, campaign, against, the, zubayrids, of, iraq, but, was, forced, to, return, to, damascus, when, al, ashdaq, and, his, loyalists, abandoned, the, army, s, camp, and, seized, control, of, the, city, al, ashdaq, viewed, abd, al, malik, s, accession, as, a, violation, of, the, caliphal, succession, agreement, reached, in, jabiya, abd, al, malik, besieged, his, kinsman, for, sixteen, days, and, promised, him, safety, and, significant, political, concessions, if, he, relinquished, the, city, though, al, ashdaq, agreed, to, the, terms, and, surrendered, abd, al, malik, remained, distrustful, of, the, former, s, ambitions, and, executed, him, personally, zufar, s, control, of, al, qarqisiya, despite, earlier, attempts, to, dislodge, him, by, ibn, ziyad, in, 685, 86, and, the, caliph, s, governor, in, homs, aban, ibn, al, walid, ibn, uqba, in, 689, 90, remained, an, obstacle, to, the, caliph, s, ambitions, in, iraq, in, revenge, for, umayr, s, slaying, zufar, had, intensified, his, raids, and, inflicted, heavy, casualties, on, the, caliph, s, tribal, allies, in, the, jazira, abd, al, malik, resolved, to, command, the, siege, of, al, qarqisiya, in, person, in, the, summer, of, 691, and, ultimately, secured, the, defection, of, zufar, and, the, pro, zubayrid, qays, in, return, for, privileged, positions, in, the, umayyad, court, and, army, the, integration, of, the, qaysi, rebels, strongly, reinforced, the, syrian, army, and, umayyad, authority, was, restored, in, the, jazira, from, then, onward, abd, al, malik, and, his, immediate, successors, attempted, to, balance, the, interests, of, the, qays, and, yaman, in, the, umayyad, court, and, army, this, represented, a, break, from, the, preceding, seven, years, during, which, the, yaman, and, particularly, the, kalb, were, the, dominant, force, of, the, army, with, threats, in, syria, and, the, jazira, neutralized, abd, al, malik, was, free, to, focus, on, the, reconquest, of, iraq, while, mus, ab, had, been, bogged, down, fighting, kharijite, rebels, and, contending, with, disaffected, arab, tribesmen, in, basra, and, kufa, abd, al, malik, was, secretly, contacting, and, winning, over, these, same, arab, nobles, thus, by, the, time, abd, al, malik, led, the, syrian, army, into, iraq, in, 691, the, struggle, to, recapture, the, province, was, virtually, complete, command, of, the, army, was, held, by, members, of, his, family, his, brother, muhammad, leading, the, vanguard, and, yazid, i, s, sons, khalid, and, abd, allah, leading, the, right, and, left, wings, respectively, many, syrian, nobles, held, reservations, about, the, campaign, and, counseled, abd, al, malik, not, to, participate, in, person, nonetheless, the, caliph, was, at, the, head, of, the, army, when, it, camped, opposite, mus, ab, s, forces, at, maskin, along, the, dujayl, canal, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, maskin, most, of, mus, ab, s, forces, many, of, whom, were, resentful, at, the, heavy, toll, he, had, exacted, on, al, mukhtar, s, kufan, partisans, refused, to, fight, and, his, leading, commander, ibn, al, ashtar, fell, at, the, beginning, of, hostilities, abd, al, malik, invited, mus, ab, to, surrender, in, return, for, the, governorship, of, iraq, or, any, other, province, of, his, choice, but, the, latter, refused, and, was, killed, in, action, following, his, victory, abd, al, malik, received, the, allegiance, of, kufa, s, nobility, and, appointed, governors, to, the, caliphate, s, eastern, provinces, afterward, he, dispatched, a, 2, 000, strong, syrian, contingent, to, subdue, ibn, al, zubayr, in, the, hejaz, the, commander, of, the, expedition, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, had, risen, through, the, ranks, and, would, become, a, highly, competent, and, efficient, supporter, of, the, caliph, al, hajjaj, remained, encamped, for, several, months, in, ta, if, east, of, mecca, and, fought, numerous, skirmishes, with, zubayrid, loyalists, in, the, plain, of, arafat, abd, al, malik, sent, him, reinforcements, led, by, his, mawl, tariq, ibn, amr, who, had, earlier, captured, medina, from, its, zubayrid, governor, in, march, 692, al, hajjaj, besieged, ibn, al, zubayr, in, mecca, and, bombarded, the, ka, aba, the, holiest, sanctuary, in, islam, with, catapults, though, 10, 000, of, ibn, al, zubayr, s, supporters, including, his, sons, eventually, surrendered, and, received, pardons, ibn, al, zubayr, and, a, core, of, his, loyalists, held, out, in, the, ka, aba, and, were, killed, by, al, hajjaj, s, troops, in, september, or, october, ibn, al, zubayr, s, death, marked, the, end, of, the, civil, war, and, the, reunification, of, the, caliphate, under, abd, al, malik, in, a, panegyric, that, the, literary, historian, suzanne, stetkevych, asserts, was, intended, to, declare, and, legitimize, abd, al, malik, s, victory, the, caliph, s, christian, court, poet, al, akhtal, eulogized, him, on, the, eve, or, aftermath, of, ibn, al, zubayr, s, fall, as, follows, to, a, man, whose, gifts, do, not, elude, us, whom, god, has, made, victorious, so, let, him, in, his, victory, long, delight, he, who, wades, into, the, deep, of, battle, auspicious, his, augury, the, caliph, of, god, through, whom, men, pray, for, rain, when, his, soul, whispers, its, intention, to, him, it, sends, him, resolutely, forth, his, courage, and, his, caution, like, two, keen, blades, in, him, the, common, weal, resides, and, after, his, assurance, no, peril, can, seduce, him, from, his, pledge, al, akhtal, 640, 708, khaffat, al, qa, nu, the, tribe, has, departed, after, his, victory, abd, al, malik, aimed, to, reconcile, with, the, hejazi, elite, including, the, zubayrids, and, the, alids, the, umayyads, rivals, within, the, quraysh, he, relied, on, the, banu, makhzum, another, qurayshite, clan, as, his, intermediaries, in, view, of, the, umayyad, family, s, absence, in, the, region, due, to, their, exile, in, 683, nevertheless, he, remained, wary, of, the, hejazi, elite, s, ambitions, and, kept, a, vigilant, eye, on, them, through, his, various, governors, in, medina, the, first, of, these, was, al, hajjaj, who, was, also, appointed, governor, of, yemen, and, the, yamama, central, arabia, and, led, the, hajj, pilgrim, caravans, of, 693, and, 694, though, he, maintained, peace, in, the, hejaz, the, harshness, of, his, rule, led, to, numerous, complaints, from, its, residents, and, may, have, played, a, role, in, his, transfer, from, the, post, by, abd, al, malik, a, member, of, the, makhzum, and, abd, al, malik, s, father, in, law, hisham, ibn, isma, il, was, ultimately, appointed, during, his, tenure, in, 701, 706, he, was, also, known, for, brutalizing, medina, s, townspeople, despite, his, victory, the, control, and, governance, of, iraq, a, politically, turbulent, province, from, the, time, of, the, muslim, conquest, in, the, 630s, continued, to, pose, a, major, challenge, for, abd, al, malik, he, had, withdrawn, the, syrian, army, and, entrusted, to, the, iraqis, the, defense, of, basra, from, the, kharijite, threat, most, iraqis, had, become, weary, of, the, conflict, with, the, kharijites, which, had, brought, them, little, but, hardship, and, loss, according, to, gibb, those, from, kufa, in, particular, had, grown, accustomed, to, the, wealth, and, comfort, of, their, lives, at, home, and, their, reluctance, to, undertake, lengthy, campaigns, far, from, their, families, was, an, issue, that, previous, rulers, of, iraq, had, consistently, encountered, initially, the, caliph, appointed, his, brother, bishr, governor, of, kufa, and, another, kinsman, khalid, ibn, abdallah, to, basra, before, the, latter, too, was, put, under, bishr, s, jurisdiction, neither, governor, was, up, to, the, task, but, the, iraqis, eventually, defeated, the, najdiyya, kharijites, in, the, yamama, in, 692, 93, the, azariqa, kharijites, in, persia, were, more, difficult, to, rein, in, and, following, bishr, s, death, in, 694, the, iraqi, troops, deserted, the, field, against, them, at, ramhormoz, abd, al, malik, s, attempt, at, family, rule, in, iraq, had, proven, unsuccessful, and, he, installed, al, hajjaj, in, the, post, instead, in, 694, kufa, and, basra, were, combined, into, a, single, province, under, al, hajjaj, who, from, the, start, of, his, rule, displayed, a, strong, commitment, to, governing, iraq, effectively, against, the, azariqa, al, hajjaj, backed, al, muhallab, ibn, abi, sufra, al, azdi, a, zubayrid, holdover, with, long, experience, combating, the, kharijite, rebels, al, muhallab, finally, defeated, the, azariqa, in, 697, concurrently, a, kharijite, revolt, led, by, shabib, ibn, yazid, al, shaybani, flared, up, in, the, heart, of, iraq, resulting, in, the, rebel, takeover, of, al, mada, in, and, siege, of, kufa, al, hajjaj, responded, to, the, unwillingness, or, inability, of, the, war, weary, iraqis, to, face, the, kharijites, by, obtaining, from, abd, al, malik, syrian, reinforcements, led, by, sufyan, ibn, al, abrad, al, kalbi, a, more, disciplined, force, the, syrians, repelled, the, rebel, attack, on, kufa, and, killed, shabib, in, early, 697, by, 698, the, kharijite, revolts, had, been, stamped, out, abd, al, malik, attached, to, iraq, sistan, and, khurasan, thus, making, al, hajjaj, responsible, for, a, super, province, encompassing, the, eastern, half, of, the, caliphate, al, hajjaj, made, al, muhallab, deputy, governor, of, khurasan, a, post, he, held, until, his, death, in, 702, after, which, it, was, bequeathed, to, his, son, yazid, during, his, term, al, muhallab, recommenced, the, muslim, conquests, in, central, asia, though, the, campaign, reaped, few, territorial, gains, during, abd, al, malik, s, reign, upon, becoming, governor, al, hajjaj, immediately, threatened, with, death, any, iraqi, who, refused, to, participate, in, the, war, efforts, against, the, kharijites, in, an, effort, to, reduce, expenditure, he, had, lowered, the, iraqis, pay, to, less, than, that, of, their, syrian, counterparts, in, the, province, by, his, measures, al, hajjaj, appeared, almost, to, have, goaded, the, iraqis, into, rebellion, as, if, looking, for, an, excuse, to, break, them, according, to, the, historian, hugh, kennedy, indeed, conflict, with, the, muq, tila, arab, tribal, forces, who, formed, iraq, s, garrisons, came, to, a, head, beginning, in, 699, when, al, hajjaj, ordered, ibn, al, ash, ath, to, lead, an, expedition, against, zabulistan, ibn, al, ash, ath, and, his, commanders, were, wealthy, and, leading, noblemen, and, bristled, at, al, hajjaj, s, frequent, rebukes, and, demands, and, the, difficulties, of, the, campaign, in, response, ibn, al, ash, ath, and, his, army, revolted, in, sistan, marched, back, and, defeated, al, hajjaj, s, loyalists, in, tustar, in, 701, and, entered, kufa, soon, after, al, hajjaj, held, out, in, basra, with, his, banu, thaqif, kinsmen, and, syrian, loyalists, who, were, numerically, insufficient, to, counter, the, unified, iraqi, front, led, by, ibn, al, ash, ath, alarmed, at, events, abd, al, malik, offered, the, iraqis, a, pay, raise, equal, to, the, syrians, and, the, replacement, of, al, hajjaj, with, ibn, al, ash, ath, due, to, his, supporters, rejection, of, the, terms, ibn, al, ash, ath, refused, the, offer, and, al, hajjaj, took, the, initiative, routing, ibn, al, ash, ath, s, forces, at, the, battle, of, dayr, al, jamajim, in, april, many, of, the, iraqis, had, defected, after, promises, of, amnesty, if, they, disarmed, while, ibn, al, ash, ath, and, his, core, supporters, fled, to, zabulistan, where, they, were, dispersed, in, 702, the, suppression, of, the, revolt, marked, the, end, of, the, iraqi, muq, tila, as, a, military, force, and, the, beginning, of, syrian, military, domination, of, iraq, iraqi, internal, divisions, and, the, utilization, of, disciplined, syrian, forces, by, abd, al, malik, and, al, hajjaj, voided, the, iraqis, attempt, to, reassert, power, in, the, province, determined, to, prevent, further, rebellions, al, hajjaj, founded, a, permanent, syrian, garrison, in, wasit, situated, between, the, long, established, iraqi, garrisons, of, kufa, and, basra, and, instituted, a, more, rigorous, administration, in, the, province, power, thereafter, derived, from, the, syrian, troops, who, became, iraq, s, ruling, class, while, iraq, s, arab, nobility, religious, scholars, and, maw, l, were, their, virtual, subjects, furthermore, the, surplus, taxes, from, the, agriculturally, rich, sawad, lands, were, redirected, from, the, muq, tila, to, abd, al, malik, s, treasury, in, damascus, to, pay, the, syrian, troops, in, the, province, this, reflected, a, wider, campaign, by, the, caliph, to, institute, greater, control, over, the, caliphate, despite, the, ten, year, truce, of, 689, war, with, byzantium, resumed, following, abd, al, malik, s, victory, against, ibn, al, zubayr, in, 692, the, decision, to, resume, hostilities, was, taken, by, emperor, justinian, ii, ostensibly, because, of, his, refusal, to, accept, payment, of, the, tribute, in, the, muslim, currency, introduced, that, year, rather, than, the, byzantine, nomisma, see, below, this, is, reported, solely, by, theophanes, and, issues, of, chronology, make, this, suspect, not, all, modern, scholars, accept, its, veracity, the, real, casus, belli, according, to, both, theophanes, and, the, later, syriac, sources, was, justinian, s, attempt, to, enforce, his, exclusive, jurisdiction, over, cyprus, and, to, move, its, population, to, cyzicus, in, northwestern, anatolia, contrary, to, the, treaty, given, the, enormous, advantages, secured, by, the, treaty, for, byzantium, justinian, s, decision, has, been, criticized, by, byzantine, and, modern, historians, alike, however, the, historian, ralph, johannes, lilie, points, out, that, with, abd, al, malik, emerging, victorious, from, the, civil, war, justinian, may, have, felt, it, was, only, a, matter, of, time, until, the, caliph, broke, the, treaty, and, resolved, to, strike, first, before, abd, al, malik, could, consolidate, his, position, further, the, umayyads, decisively, defeated, the, byzantines, at, the, battle, of, sebastopolis, in, 692, and, parried, a, byzantine, counter, attack, in, 693, 94, in, the, direction, of, antioch, over, the, following, years, the, umayyads, launched, constant, raids, against, the, byzantine, territories, in, anatolia, and, armenia, led, by, the, caliph, s, brother, muhammad, and, his, sons, al, walid, abd, allah, and, maslama, laying, the, foundation, for, further, conquests, in, these, areas, under, abd, al, malik, s, successors, which, would, culminate, in, the, second, arab, siege, of, constantinople, in, 717, 718, the, military, defeats, inflicted, on, justinian, ii, contributed, to, the, downfall, of, the, emperor, and, his, heraclian, dynasty, in, 695, ushering, in, a, 22, year, period, of, instability, in, which, the, byzantine, throne, changed, hands, seven, times, in, violent, revolutions, further, aiding, the, arab, advance, in, 698, 99, emperor, tiberios, iii, r, 698, 705, secured, a, treaty, with, the, caliph, for, the, return, of, the, cypriots, both, those, moved, by, justinian, ii, as, well, as, those, subsequently, deported, by, the, arabs, to, syria, to, their, island, beginning, in, 700, abd, al, malik, s, brother, muhammad, subdued, armenia, in, a, series, of, campaigns, the, armenians, rebelled, in, 703, and, received, byzantine, aid, but, muhammad, defeated, them, and, sealed, the, failure, of, the, revolt, by, executing, the, rebel, princes, in, 705, as, a, result, armenia, was, annexed, into, the, caliphate, along, with, the, principalities, of, caucasian, albania, and, iberia, as, the, province, of, arminiya, meanwhile, in, north, africa, a, byzantine, berber, alliance, had, reconquered, ifriqiya, and, slain, its, governor, uqba, ibn, nafi, in, the, battle, of, vescera, in, 682, abd, al, malik, charged, uqba, s, deputy, zuhayr, ibn, qays, to, reassert, the, arab, position, in, 688, but, after, initial, gains, including, the, slaying, of, the, berber, ruler, kasila, at, the, battle, of, mams, zuhayr, was, driven, back, to, barqa, cyrenaica, by, kasila, s, partisans, and, slain, by, byzantine, naval, raiders, in, 695, abd, al, malik, dispatched, hassan, ibn, al, nu, man, with, a, 40, 000, strong, army, to, retake, ifriqiya, hassan, captured, byzantine, held, kairouan, carthage, and, bizerte, with, the, aid, of, naval, reinforcements, sent, by, emperor, leontios, r, 695, 698, the, byzantines, recaptured, carthage, by, 696, 97, after, the, byzantines, were, repelled, carthage, was, captured, and, destroyed, by, hassan, in, 698, signaling, the, final, irretrievable, end, of, roman, power, in, africa, according, to, kennedy, kairouan, was, firmly, secured, as, a, launchpad, for, later, conquests, while, the, port, town, of, tunis, was, founded, and, equipped, with, an, arsenal, on, the, orders, of, abd, al, malik, who, was, intent, on, establishing, a, strong, arab, fleet, hassan, continued, his, campaign, against, the, berbers, defeating, them, and, killing, their, leader, the, warrior, queen, al, kahina, between, 698, and, 703, afterward, hassan, was, dismissed, by, abd, al, aziz, and, replaced, by, musa, ibn, nusayr, who, went, on, to, lead, the, umayyad, conquests, of, western, north, africa, and, the, iberian, peninsula, during, the, reign, of, al, walid, the, last, years, of, abd, al, malik, s, reign, were, generally, characterized, by, the, sources, as, a, domestically, peaceful, and, prosperous, consolidation, of, power, the, blood, feuds, between, the, qays, and, yaman, which, persisted, despite, the, former, s, reconciliation, with, the, umayyads, in, 691, had, dissipated, toward, the, end, of, his, rule, dixon, credits, this, to, abd, al, malik, s, success, at, harnessing, tribal, feeling, to, the, interests, of, the, government, at, the, same, time, suppressing, its, violent, manifestations, the, remaining, principal, issue, faced, by, the, caliph, was, ensuring, the, succession, of, his, eldest, son, al, walid, in, place, of, the, designated, successor, abd, al, aziz, the, latter, consistently, refused, abd, al, malik, s, entreaties, to, step, down, from, the, line, of, succession, but, potential, conflict, was, avoided, when, abd, al, aziz, died, in, may, 705, he, was, promptly, replaced, as, governor, of, egypt, by, the, caliph, s, son, abd, allah, abd, al, malik, died, five, months, later, on, 9, october, the, cause, of, his, death, was, attributed, by, the, historian, al, asma, i, d, 828, to, the, plague, of, the, maidens, so, called, because, it, originated, with, the, young, women, of, basra, before, spreading, across, iraq, and, syria, he, was, buried, outside, of, the, bab, al, jabiya, gate, of, damascus, abd, al, malik, is, considered, the, most, celebrated, umayyad, caliph, by, the, historian, julius, wellhausen, his, reign, had, been, a, period, of, hard, won, successes, in, the, words, of, kennedy, the, 9th, century, historian, al, yaqubi, described, abd, al, malik, as, courageous, shrewd, and, sagacious, but, also, miserly, his, successor, al, walid, continued, his, father, s, policies, and, his, rule, likely, marked, the, peak, of, umayyad, power, and, prosperity, abd, al, malik, s, key, administrative, reforms, reunification, of, the, caliphate, and, suppression, of, all, active, domestic, opposition, enabled, the, major, territorial, expansion, of, the, caliphate, during, al, walid, s, reign, three, other, sons, of, abd, al, malik, sulayman, yazid, ii, and, hisham, would, rule, in, succession, until, 743, interrupted, only, by, the, rule, of, abd, al, aziz, s, son, umar, ii, r, 717, 720, with, the, exceptions, of, the, latter, and, marwan, ii, r, 744, 750, all, the, umayyad, caliphs, who, came, after, abd, al, malik, were, directly, descended, from, him, hence, the, references, to, him, as, the, father, of, kings, in, the, traditional, muslim, sources, the, umayyad, emirs, and, caliphs, who, ruled, in, the, iberian, peninsula, between, 756, and, 1031, were, also, his, direct, descendants, in, the, assessment, of, his, biographer, chase, f, robinson, mu, awiya, may, have, introduced, the, principle, of, dynastic, succession, into, the, ruling, tradition, of, early, islam, but, abd, al, malik, made, it, work, am, r, al, mu, min, n, commander, of, the, faithful, is, the, most, referenced, formal, title, of, abd, al, malik, in, coins, inscriptions, and, the, early, muslim, literary, tradition, he, is, also, referred, to, as, khal, fat, all, h, caliph, of, god, in, a, number, of, coins, minted, in, the, mid, 690s, correspondence, from, his, viceroy, al, hajjaj, ibn, yusuf, and, poetic, verses, by, his, contemporaries, al, akhtal, jarir, and, al, farazdaq, abd, al, malik, s, concentration, of, power, into, the, hands, of, his, family, was, unprecedented, at, one, point, his, brothers, or, sons, held, nearly, all, governorships, of, the, provinces, and, syria, s, districts, likewise, his, court, in, damascus, was, filled, with, far, more, umayyads, than, under, his, sufyanid, predecessors, a, result, of, the, clan, s, exile, to, the, city, from, medina, in, 683, he, maintained, close, ties, with, the, sufyanids, through, marital, relations, and, official, appointments, such, as, according, yazid, i, s, son, khalid, a, prominent, role, in, the, court, and, army, and, wedding, to, him, his, daughter, a, isha, abd, al, malik, also, married, khalid, s, sister, atika, who, became, his, favorite, and, most, influential, wife, after, his, victory, in, the, civil, war, abd, al, malik, embarked, on, a, far, reaching, campaign, to, consolidate, umayyad, rule, over, the, caliphate, the, collapse, of, umayyad, authority, precipitated, by, mu, awiya, i, s, death, made, it, apparent, to, abd, al, malik, that, the, decentralized, sufyanid, system, was, unsustainable, moreover, despite, the, defeat, of, his, muslim, rivals, his, dynasty, remained, domestically, and, externally, insecure, prompting, a, need, to, legitimize, its, existence, according, to, blankinship, abd, al, malik, s, solution, to, the, fractious, tribalism, which, defined, his, predecessors, caliphate, was, to, centralize, power, at, the, same, time, his, response, to, the, byzantine, christian, resurgence, and, the, criticism, of, muslim, religious, circles, which, dated, from, the, beginning, of, umayyad, rule, and, culminated, with, the, outbreak, of, the, civil, war, was, to, implement, islamization, measures, the, centralized, administration, he, established, became, the, prototype, of, later, medieval, muslim, states, in, kennedy, s, assessment, abd, al, malik, s, centralized, bureaucratic, empire, was, in, many, ways, an, impressive, achievement, but, the, political, economic, and, social, divisions, that, developed, within, the, islamic, community, during, his, reign, was, to, prove, something, of, a, difficult, inheritance, for, the, later, umayyads, according, to, wellhausen, government, evidently, became, more, technical, and, hierarchical, under, abd, al, malik, though, not, nearly, to, the, extent, of, the, later, abbasid, caliphs, as, opposed, to, the, freewheeling, governing, style, of, the, sufyanids, abd, al, malik, ruled, strictly, over, his, officials, and, kept, interactions, with, them, largely, formal, he, put, an, end, to, the, provinces, retention, of, the, lion, s, share, of, surplus, tax, revenues, as, had, been, the, case, under, the, sufyanids, and, had, them, redirected, to, the, caliphal, treasury, in, damascus, he, supported, al, hajjaj, s, policy, of, collecting, the, poll, tax, traditionally, imposed, on, the, caliphate, s, non, muslim, subjects, from, the, maw, l, of, iraq, and, instructed, abd, al, aziz, to, implement, this, measure, in, egypt, though, the, latter, allegedly, disregarded, the, order, abd, al, malik, may, have, inaugurated, several, high, ranking, offices, and, muslim, tradition, generally, credits, him, with, the, organization, of, the, bar, d, postal, service, whose, principal, purpose, was, to, efficiently, inform, the, caliph, of, developments, outside, of, damascus, he, built, and, repaired, roads, that, connected, damascus, with, palestine, and, linked, jerusalem, to, its, eastern, and, western, hinterlands, as, evidenced, by, seven, milestones, found, throughout, the, region, the, oldest, of, which, dates, to, may, 692, and, the, latest, to, september, 704, the, road, project, formed, part, of, abd, al, malik, s, centralization, drive, special, attention, being, paid, to, palestine, due, to, its, critical, position, as, a, transit, zone, between, syria, and, egypt, and, jerusalem, s, religious, centrality, to, the, caliph, a, major, component, of, abd, al, malik, s, centralization, and, islamization, measures, was, the, institution, of, an, islamic, currency, the, byzantine, gold, solidus, was, discontinued, in, syria, and, egypt, the, likely, impetus, being, the, byzantines, addition, of, an, image, of, christ, on, their, coins, in, 691, 92, which, violated, muslim, prohibitions, on, images, of, prophets, to, replace, the, byzantine, coins, he, introduced, an, islamic, gold, currency, the, dinar, in, 693, initially, the, new, coinage, contained, depictions, of, the, caliph, as, the, spiritual, leader, of, the, muslim, community, and, its, supreme, military, commander, this, image, proved, no, more, acceptable, to, muslim, officialdom, and, was, replaced, in, 696, or, 697, with, image, less, coinage, inscribed, with, qur, anic, quotes, and, other, muslim, religious, formulas, in, 698, 99, similar, changes, were, made, to, the, silver, dirhams, issued, by, the, muslims, in, the, former, sasanian, persian, lands, in, the, eastern, caliphate, depictions, of, the, sasanian, king, were, consequently, removed, from, the, coinage, though, abd, al, malik, s, new, dirham, retained, its, characteristically, sasanian, silver, fabric, and, wide, flan, shortly, after, the, overhaul, of, the, caliphate, s, currency, in, circa, 700, abd, al, malik, is, generally, credited, with, the, replacement, of, greek, with, arabic, as, the, language, of, the, d, w, n, in, syria, the, transition, was, carried, out, by, his, scribe, sulayman, ibn, sa, d, al, hajjaj, had, initiated, the, arabization, of, the, persian, d, w, n, in, iraq, three, years, before, though, the, official, language, was, changed, greek, and, persian, speaking, bureaucrats, who, were, versed, in, arabic, kept, their, posts, the, arabization, of, the, bureaucracy, and, currency, was, the, most, consequential, administrative, reform, undertaken, by, the, caliph, arabic, ultimately, became, the, sole, official, language, of, the, umayyad, state, but, the, transition, in, faraway, provinces, such, as, khurasan, did, not, occur, until, the, 740s, according, to, gibb, the, decree, was, the, first, step, towards, the, reorganization, and, unification, of, the, diverse, tax, systems, in, the, provinces, and, also, a, step, towards, a, more, definitely, muslim, administration, indeed, it, formed, an, important, part, of, the, islamization, measures, that, lent, the, umayyad, caliphate, a, more, ideological, and, programmatic, coloring, it, had, previously, lacked, according, to, blankinship, in, tandem, abd, al, malik, began, the, export, of, papyri, containing, the, muslim, statement, of, belief, in, greek, to, spread, islamic, teachings, in, the, byzantine, realm, this, was, a, further, testament, to, the, ideological, expansion, of, the, byzantine, muslim, struggle, the, increasingly, muslim, character, of, the, state, under, abd, al, malik, was, partly, a, reflection, of, islam, s, influence, in, the, lives, of, the, caliph, and, the, chief, enforcer, of, his, policies, al, hajjaj, both, of, whom, belonged, to, the, first, generation, of, rulers, born, and, raised, as, muslims, having, spent, most, of, their, lives, in, the, hejaz, the, theological, and, legal, center, of, islam, where, arabic, was, spoken, exclusively, and, administrative, offices, were, held, solely, by, arab, muslims, abd, al, malik, and, his, viceroy, only, understood, arabic, and, were, unfamiliar, with, the, syrian, and, greek, christian, and, persian, zoroastrian, officials, of, the, d, w, n, they, stood, in, stark, contrast, to, the, sufyanid, caliphs, and, their, governors, in, iraq, who, had, entered, these, regions, as, youths, and, whose, children, were, as, acquainted, with, the, native, majority, as, with, the, arab, muslim, newcomers, according, to, wellhausen, abd, al, malik, was, careful, not, to, offend, his, pious, subjects, in, the, careless, fashion, of, yazid, but, from, the, time, of, his, accession, he, subordinated, everything, to, policy, and, even, exposed, the, ka, ba, to, the, danger, of, destruction, despite, the, piety, of, his, upbringing, and, early, career, dixon, challenges, this, view, attributing, the, abbasid, era, muslim, sources, portrayal, of, abd, al, malik, s, transformation, in, character, after, his, accession, and, the, consequent, abandonment, of, his, piety, to, their, general, hostility, to, abd, al, malik, whom, they, variously, accused, of, being, a, mean, treacherous, and, blood, thirsty, person, dixon, nonetheless, concedes, that, the, caliph, disregarded, his, early, muslim, ideals, when, he, felt, political, circumstances, necessitated, it, abd, al, malik, shifted, away, from, his, predecessors, use, of, arab, tribal, masses, in, favor, of, an, organized, army, likewise, arab, noblemen, who, had, derived, their, power, solely, through, their, tribal, standing, and, personal, relations, with, a, caliph, were, gradually, replaced, with, military, men, who, had, risen, through, the, ranks, these, developments, have, been, partially, obscured, by, the, medieval, sources, due, to, their, continued, usage, of, arab, tribal, terminology, when, referencing, the, army, such, as, the, names, of, the, tribal, confederations, mudar, rabi, a, qays, and, yaman, according, to, hawting, these, do, not, represent, the, tribes, in, arms, utilized, by, earlier, caliphs, rather, they, denote, army, factions, whose, membership, was, often, but, not, exclusively, determined, by, tribal, origin, abd, al, malik, also, established, a, berber, dominated, private, militia, called, al, wa, iya, after, their, original, commander, the, caliph, s, mawl, al, waddah, which, helped, enforce, the, authority, of, umayyad, caliphs, through, the, reign, of, marwan, ii, under, abd, al, malik, loyalist, syrian, troops, began, to, be, deployed, throughout, the, caliphate, to, keep, order, which, came, largely, at, the, expense, of, the, tribal, nobility, of, iraq, the, latter, s, revolt, under, ibn, al, ash, ath, demonstrated, to, abd, al, malik, the, unreliability, of, the, iraqi, muq, tila, in, securing, the, central, government, s, interests, in, the, province, and, its, eastern, dependencies, it, was, following, the, revolt, s, suppression, that, the, military, became, primarily, composed, of, the, syrian, army, consecrating, this, transformation, was, a, fundamental, change, to, the, system, of, military, pay, whereby, salaries, were, restricted, to, those, in, active, service, this, marked, an, end, to, the, system, established, by, caliph, umar, r, 634, 644, which, paid, stipends, to, veterans, of, the, earlier, muslim, conquests, and, their, descendants, while, the, iraqi, tribal, nobility, viewed, the, stipends, as, their, traditional, right, al, hajjaj, viewed, them, as, a, handicap, restricting, his, and, abd, al, malik, s, executive, authority, and, financial, ability, to, reward, loyalists, in, the, army, stipends, were, similarly, stopped, to, the, inhabitants, of, the, hejaz, including, the, quraysh, thus, a, professional, army, was, established, during, abd, al, malik, s, reign, whose, salaries, derived, from, tax, proceeds, the, dependence, on, the, syrian, army, of, his, successors, especially, hisham, r, 724, 743, scattered, the, army, among, the, caliphate, s, multiple, and, isolated, war, fronts, most, of, them, distant, from, syria, the, growing, strain, and, heavy, losses, inflicted, on, the, syrians, by, the, caliphate, s, external, enemies, and, increasing, factional, divisions, within, the, army, contributed, to, the, weakening, and, downfall, of, umayyad, rule, in, 750, in, 685, 86, or, 688, abd, al, malik, began, planning, the, construction, of, the, dome, of, the, rock, in, jerusalem, its, dedication, inscription, mentions, the, year, 691, 92, which, most, scholars, agree, is, the, completion, date, of, the, building, it, is, the, earliest, archaeologically, attested, religious, structure, to, be, built, by, a, muslim, ruler, and, the, building, s, inscriptions, contain, the, earliest, epigraphic, proclamations, of, islam, and, of, muhammad, the, inscriptions, proved, to, be, a, milestone, as, afterward, they, became, a, common, feature, in, islamic, structures, and, almost, always, mention, muhammad, the, dome, of, the, rock, remains, a, unique, monument, of, islamic, culture, in, almost, all, respects, including, as, a, work, of, art, and, as, a, cultural, and, pious, document, according, to, historian, oleg, grabar, narratives, by, the, medieval, sources, about, abd, al, malik, s, motivations, in, building, the, dome, of, the, rock, vary, at, the, time, of, its, construction, the, caliph, was, engaged, in, war, with, christian, byzantium, and, its, syrian, christian, allies, on, the, one, hand, and, with, the, rival, caliph, ibn, al, zubayr, who, controlled, mecca, the, annual, destination, of, muslim, pilgrimage, on, the, other, hand, thus, one, series, of, explanations, was, that, abd, al, malik, intended, for, the, dome, of, the, rock, to, be, a, religious, monument, of, victory, over, the, christians, that, would, distinguish, islam, s, uniqueness, within, the, common, abrahamic, religious, setting, of, jerusalem, home, of, the, two, older, abrahamic, faiths, judaism, and, christianity, the, other, main, explanation, holds, that, abd, al, malik, in, the, heat, of, the, war, with, ibn, al, zubayr, sought, to, build, the, structure, to, divert, the, focus, of, the, muslims, in, his, realm, from, the, ka, aba, in, mecca, where, ibn, al, zubayr, would, publicly, condemn, the, umayyads, during, the, annual, pilgrimage, to, the, sanctuary, though, most, modern, historians, dismiss, the, latter, account, as, a, product, of, anti, umayyad, propaganda, in, the, traditional, muslim, sources, and, doubt, that, abd, al, malik, would, attempt, to, alter, the, sacred, muslim, requirement, of, fulfilling, the, pilgrimage, to, the, ka, aba, other, historians, concede, this, cannot, be, conclusively, dismissed, while, his, sons, commissioned, numerous, architectural, works, abd, al, malik, s, known, building, activities, were, limited, to, jerusalem, as, well, as, the, dome, of, the, rock, he, is, credited, with, constructing, the, adjacent, dome, of, the, chain, expanding, the, boundaries, of, the, temple, mount, haram, al, sharif, to, include, the, foundation, stone, around, which, the, dome, of, the, rock, was, built, and, building, two, gates, of, the, temple, mount, possibly, the, mercy, gate, and, the, prophet, s, gate, theophanes, possibly, conserving, an, original, syro, palestinian, melkite, source, reports, that, abd, al, malik, sought, to, remove, some, columns, from, a, christian, shrine, at, gethsemane, to, rebuild, the, ka, aba, but, he, was, dissuaded, by, his, christian, treasurer, sarjun, ibn, mansur, the, father, of, john, of, damascus, and, another, leading, christian, called, patrikios, from, palestine, who, successfully, petitioned, emperor, justinian, ii, to, supply, other, columns, instead, abd,
