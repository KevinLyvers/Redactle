narmer, ancient, egyptian, n, r, mr, may, mean, painful, catfish, stinging, catfish, harsh, catfish, or, fierce, catfish, fl, c, 3150, bc, was, an, ancient, egyptian, pharaoh, of, the, early, dynastic, period, whose, reign, began, at, a, date, estimated, to, fall, in, the, range, 3273, 2987, bc, he, was, the, successor, to, the, protodynastic, king, ka, many, scholars, consider, him, the, unifier, of, egypt, and, founder, of, the, first, dynasty, and, in, turn, the, first, king, of, a, unified, egypt, he, also, had, a, prominently, noticeable, presence, in, canaan, compared, to, his, predecessors, and, successors, neithhotep, is, thought, to, be, his, queen, consort, or, his, daughter, a, majority, of, egyptologists, believe, that, narmer, was, the, same, person, as, menes, although, highly, interrelated, the, questions, of, who, was, menes, and, who, unified, egypt, are, actually, two, separate, issues, narmer, is, often, credited, with, the, unification, of, egypt, by, means, of, the, conquest, of, lower, egypt, by, upper, egypt, menes, is, traditionally, considered, the, first, king, pharaoh, of, ancient, egypt, and, is, identified, by, the, majority, of, egyptologists, as, the, same, person, as, narmer, although, a, vigorous, debate, also, proposes, identification, with, hor, aha, narmer, s, successor, as, a, primary, alternative, the, issue, is, confusing, because, narmer, is, a, horus, name, while, menes, is, a, sedge, and, bee, name, personal, or, birth, name, all, of, the, king, lists, which, began, to, appear, in, the, new, kingdom, era, list, the, personal, names, of, the, kings, and, almost, all, begin, with, menes, or, begin, with, divine, and, or, semi, divine, rulers, with, menes, as, the, first, human, king, the, difficulty, is, aligning, the, contemporary, archaeological, evidence, which, lists, horus, names, with, the, king, lists, that, list, personal, names, two, documents, have, been, put, forward, as, proof, either, that, narmer, was, menes, or, alternatively, hor, aha, was, menes, the, first, is, the, naqada, label, found, at, the, site, of, naqada, in, the, tomb, of, queen, neithhotep, often, assumed, to, have, been, the, mother, of, horus, aha, the, label, shows, a, serekh, of, hor, aha, next, to, an, enclosure, inside, of, which, are, symbols, that, have, been, interpreted, by, some, scholars, as, the, name, menes, the, second, is, the, seal, impression, from, abydos, that, alternates, between, a, serekh, of, narmer, and, the, chessboard, symbol, mn, which, is, interpreted, as, an, abbreviation, of, menes, arguments, have, been, made, with, regard, to, each, of, these, documents, in, favour, of, narmer, or, hor, aha, being, menes, but, in, neither, case, is, the, argument, conclusive, the, second, document, the, seal, impression, from, abydos, shows, the, serekh, of, narmer, alternating, with, the, gameboard, sign, mn, together, with, its, phonetic, complement, the, n, sign, which, is, always, shown, when, the, full, name, of, menes, is, written, again, representing, the, name, menes, at, first, glance, this, would, seem, to, be, strong, evidence, that, narmer, was, menes, however, based, on, an, analysis, of, other, early, first, dynasty, seal, impressions, which, contain, the, name, of, one, or, more, princes, the, seal, impression, has, been, interpreted, by, other, scholars, as, showing, the, name, of, a, prince, of, narmer, named, menes, hence, menes, was, narmer, s, successor, hor, aha, and, thus, hor, aha, was, menes, this, was, refuted, by, cervell, autuori, 2005, pp, 42, 45, but, opinions, still, vary, and, the, seal, impression, cannot, be, said, to, definitively, support, either, theory, two, necropolis, sealings, found, in, 1985, and, 1991, in, abydos, umm, el, qa, ab, in, or, near, the, tombs, of, den, and, qa, a, show, narmer, as, the, first, king, on, each, list, followed, by, hor, aha, the, qa, a, sealing, lists, all, eight, of, the, kings, of, what, scholars, now, call, the, first, dynasty, in, the, correct, order, starting, with, narmer, these, necropolis, sealings, are, strong, evidence, that, narmer, was, the, first, king, of, the, first, dynasty, hence, the, same, person, as, menes, the, complete, spelling, of, narmer, s, name, consists, of, the, hieroglyphs, for, a, catfish, n, r, and, a, chisel, mr, hence, the, reading, narmer, using, the, rebus, principle, this, word, is, sometimes, translated, as, raging, catfish, however, there, is, no, consensus, on, this, reading, other, translations, of, the, adjective, before, catfish, include, angry, fighting, fierce, painful, furious, bad, evil, biting, menacing, and, stinging, some, scholars, have, taken, entirely, different, approaches, to, reading, the, name, that, do, not, include, catfish, in, the, name, at, all, but, these, approaches, have, not, been, generally, accepted, rather, than, incorporating, both, hieroglyphs, narmer, s, name, is, often, shown, in, an, abbreviated, form, with, just, the, catfish, symbol, sometimes, stylized, even, in, some, cases, represented, by, just, a, horizontal, line, this, simplified, spelling, appears, to, be, related, to, the, formality, of, the, context, in, every, case, that, a, serekh, is, shown, on, a, work, of, stone, or, an, official, seal, impression, it, has, both, symbols, but, in, most, cases, where, the, name, is, shown, on, a, piece, of, pottery, or, a, rock, inscription, just, the, catfish, or, a, simplified, version, of, it, appears, two, alternative, spellings, of, narmer, s, name, have, also, been, found, on, a, mud, sealing, from, tarkhan, the, symbol, for, the, j, bird, gardiner, sign, g47, duckling, has, been, added, to, the, two, symbols, for, narmer, within, the, serekh, this, has, been, interpreted, as, meaning, narmer, the, masculine, however, according, to, ilona, regulski, the, third, sign, the, bird, is, not, an, integral, part, of, the, royal, name, since, it, occurs, so, infrequently, godron, suggested, that, the, extra, sign, is, not, part, of, the, name, but, was, put, inside, the, serekh, for, compositional, convenience, in, addition, two, necropolis, seals, from, abydos, show, the, name, in, a, unique, way, while, the, chisel, is, shown, conventionally, where, the, catfish, would, be, expected, there, is, a, symbol, that, has, been, interpreted, by, several, scholars, as, an, animal, skin, according, to, dreyer, it, is, probably, a, catfish, with, a, bull, s, tail, similar, to, the, image, of, narmer, on, the, narmer, palette, in, which, he, is, shown, wearing, a, bull, s, tail, as, a, symbol, of, power, the, date, commonly, given, for, the, beginning, of, narmer, s, reign, is, c, 3100, bc, other, mainstream, estimates, using, both, the, historical, method, and, radiocarbon, dating, are, in, the, range, c, 3273, 2987, bc, the, famous, narmer, palette, discovered, by, james, e, quibell, in, the, 1897, 1898, season, at, hierakonpolis, shows, narmer, wearing, the, crown, of, upper, egypt, on, one, side, of, the, palette, and, the, crown, of, lower, egypt, on, the, other, side, giving, rise, to, the, theory, that, narmer, unified, the, two, lands, since, its, discovery, however, it, has, been, debated, whether, the, narmer, palette, represents, an, actual, historic, event, or, is, purely, symbolic, of, course, the, narmer, palette, could, represent, an, actual, historical, event, while, at, the, same, time, having, a, symbolic, significance, in, 1993, g, nter, dreyer, discovered, a, year, label, of, narmer, at, abydos, depicting, the, same, event, that, is, depicted, on, the, narmer, palette, in, the, first, dynasty, years, were, identified, by, the, name, of, the, king, and, an, important, event, that, occurred, in, that, year, a, year, label, was, typically, attached, to, a, container, of, goods, and, included, the, name, of, the, king, a, description, or, representation, of, the, event, that, identified, the, year, and, a, description, of, the, attached, goods, this, year, label, shows, that, the, narmer, palette, depicts, an, actual, historical, event, support, for, this, conclusion, in, addition, to, dreyer, includes, wilkinson, and, davies, friedman, although, this, interpretation, of, the, year, label, is, the, dominant, opinion, among, egyptologists, there, are, exceptions, including, baines, and, wengrow, archaeological, evidence, suggests, that, egypt, was, at, least, partially, unified, during, the, reigns, of, ka, and, iry, hor, narmer, s, immediate, predecessors, and, perhaps, as, early, as, scorpion, i, tax, collection, is, probably, documented, for, ka, and, iry, hor, the, evidence, for, a, role, for, scorpion, i, in, lower, egypt, comes, from, his, tomb, uj, in, abydos, upper, egypt, where, labels, were, found, identifying, goods, from, lower, egypt, these, are, not, tax, documents, however, so, they, are, probably, indications, of, trade, rather, than, subjugation, there, is, a, substantial, difference, in, the, quantity, and, distribution, of, inscriptions, with, the, names, of, those, earlier, kings, in, lower, egypt, and, canaan, which, was, reached, through, lower, egypt, compared, to, the, inscriptions, of, narmer, ka, s, inscriptions, have, been, found, in, three, sites, in, lower, egypt, and, one, in, canaan, iry, hor, inscriptions, have, also, been, found, in, two, sites, in, lower, egypt, and, one, in, canaan, this, must, be, compared, to, narmer, whose, serekhs, have, been, found, in, ten, sites, in, lower, egypt, and, nine, sites, in, canaan, see, discussion, in, tomb, and, artefacts, section, this, demonstrates, a, qualitative, difference, between, narmer, s, role, in, lower, egypt, compared, to, his, two, immediate, predecessors, there, is, no, evidence, in, lower, egypt, of, any, upper, egyptian, king, s, presence, before, iry, hor, the, archaeological, evidence, suggest, that, the, unification, began, before, narmer, but, was, completed, by, him, through, the, conquest, of, a, polity, in, the, north, west, delta, as, depicted, on, the, narmer, palette, the, importance, that, narmer, attached, to, his, unification, of, egypt, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, it, is, commemorated, not, only, on, the, narmer, palette, but, on, a, cylinder, seal, the, narmer, year, label, and, the, narmer, boxes, and, the, consequences, of, the, event, are, commemorated, on, the, narmer, macehead, the, importance, of, the, unification, to, ancient, egyptians, is, shown, by, the, fact, that, narmer, is, shown, as, the, first, king, on, the, two, necropolis, seals, and, under, the, name, menes, the, first, king, in, the, later, king, lists, although, there, is, archaeological, evidence, of, a, few, kings, before, narmer, none, of, them, are, mentioned, in, any, of, those, sources, it, can, be, accurately, said, that, from, the, point, of, view, of, ancient, egyptians, history, began, with, narmer, and, the, unification, of, egypt, and, that, everything, before, him, was, relegated, to, the, realm, of, myth, according, to, manetho, quoted, in, eusebius, fr, 7, a, menes, made, a, foreign, expedition, and, won, renown, if, this, is, correct, and, assuming, it, refers, to, narmer, it, was, undoubtedly, to, the, land, of, canaan, where, narmer, s, serekh, has, been, identified, at, nine, different, sites, an, egyptian, presence, in, canaan, predates, narmer, but, after, about, 200, years, of, active, presence, in, canaan, egyptian, presence, peaked, during, narmer, s, reign, and, quickly, declined, afterwards, the, relationship, between, egypt, and, canaan, began, around, the, end, of, the, fifth, millennium, and, apparently, came, to, an, end, sometime, during, the, second, dynasty, when, it, ceased, altogether, it, peaked, during, dynasty, 0, through, the, reign, of, narmer, dating, to, this, period, are, 33, egyptian, serekhs, found, in, canaan, among, which, 20, have, been, attributed, to, narmer, prior, to, narmer, only, one, serekh, of, ka, and, one, inscription, with, iry, hor, s, name, have, been, found, in, canaan, the, serekhs, earlier, than, iry, hor, are, either, generic, serekhs, that, do, not, refer, to, a, specific, king, or, are, for, kings, not, attested, in, abydos, indicative, of, the, decline, of, egyptian, presence, in, the, region, after, narmer, only, one, serekh, attributed, to, his, successor, hor, aha, has, been, found, in, canaan, even, this, one, example, is, questionable, wilkinson, does, not, believe, there, are, any, serekhs, of, hor, aha, outside, egypt, and, very, few, serekhs, of, kings, for, the, rest, of, the, first, two, dynasties, have, been, found, in, canaan, the, egyptian, presence, in, canaan, is, best, demonstrated, by, the, presence, of, pottery, made, from, egyptian, nile, clay, and, found, in, canaan, as, well, as, pottery, made, from, local, clay, but, in, the, egyptian, style, the, latter, suggests, the, existence, of, egyptian, colonies, rather, than, just, trade, the, nature, of, egypt, s, role, in, canaan, has, been, vigorously, debated, between, scholars, who, suggest, a, military, invasion, and, others, proposing, that, only, trade, and, colonization, were, involved, although, the, latter, has, gained, predominance, the, presence, of, fortifications, at, tell, es, sakan, dating, to, dynasty, 0, through, early, dynasty, 1, period, and, built, almost, entirely, using, an, egyptian, style, of, construction, demonstrate, that, there, must, have, also, been, some, kind, of, egyptian, military, presence, regardless, of, the, nature, of, egypt, s, presence, in, canaan, control, of, trade, to, and, through, canaan, was, important, to, ancient, egypt, narmer, probably, did, not, establish, egypt, s, initial, influence, in, canaan, by, a, military, invasion, but, a, military, campaign, by, narmer, to, re, assert, egyptian, authority, or, to, increase, its, sphere, of, influence, in, the, region, is, certainly, plausible, in, addition, to, the, quote, by, manetho, and, the, large, number, of, narmer, serekhs, found, in, canaan, a, recent, reconstruction, of, a, box, of, narmer, s, by, dreyer, may, have, commemorated, a, military, campaign, in, canaan, it, may, also, represent, just, the, presentation, of, tribute, to, narmer, by, canaanites, narmer, and, hor, aha, s, names, were, both, found, in, what, is, believed, to, be, neithhotep, s, tomb, which, led, egyptologists, to, conclude, that, she, was, narmer, s, queen, and, mother, of, hor, aha, neithhotep, s, name, means, neith, is, satisfied, this, suggests, that, she, was, a, princess, of, lower, egypt, based, on, the, fact, that, neith, is, the, patron, goddess, of, sais, in, the, western, delta, exactly, the, area, narmer, conquered, to, complete, the, unification, of, egypt, and, that, this, was, a, marriage, to, consolidate, the, two, regions, of, egypt, the, fact, that, her, tomb, is, in, naqada, in, upper, egypt, has, led, some, to, the, conclusion, that, she, was, a, descendant, of, the, predynastic, rulers, of, naqada, who, ruled, prior, to, its, incorporation, into, a, united, upper, egypt, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, the, narmer, macehead, commemorates, this, wedding, however, the, discovery, in, 2012, of, rock, inscriptions, in, sinai, by, pierre, tallet, raise, questions, about, whether, she, was, really, narmer, s, wife, neithhotep, is, probably, the, earliest, non, mythical, woman, in, history, whose, name, is, known, to, us, today, narmer, s, tomb, in, umm, el, qa, ab, near, abydos, in, upper, egypt, consists, of, two, joined, chambers, b17, and, b18, lined, in, mud, brick, although, both, mile, am, lineau, and, petrie, excavated, tombs, b17, and, b18, it, was, only, in, 1964, that, kaiser, identified, them, as, being, narmer, s, narmer, s, tomb, is, located, next, to, the, tombs, of, ka, who, likely, ruled, upper, egypt, just, before, narmer, and, hor, aha, who, was, his, immediate, successor, as, the, tomb, dates, back, more, than, 5, 000, years, and, has, been, pillaged, repeatedly, from, antiquity, to, modern, times, it, is, amazing, that, anything, useful, could, be, discovered, in, it, because, of, the, repeated, disturbances, in, umm, el, qa, ab, many, articles, of, narmer, s, were, found, in, other, graves, and, objects, of, other, kings, were, recovered, in, narmer, s, grave, however, flinders, petrie, during, the, period, 1899, 1903, and, starting, in, the, 1970s, the, german, archaeological, institute, dai, have, made, discoveries, of, the, greatest, importance, to, the, history, of, early, egypt, by, their, re, excavation, of, the, tombs, of, umm, el, qa, ab, despite, the, chaotic, condition, of, the, cemetery, inscriptions, on, both, wood, and, bone, seal, impressions, as, well, as, dozens, of, flint, arrowheads, were, found, petrie, says, with, dismay, that, hundreds, of, arrowheads, were, discovered, by, the, french, presumably, am, lineau, what, happened, to, them, is, not, clear, but, none, ended, up, in, the, cairo, museum, flint, knives, and, a, fragment, of, an, ebony, chair, leg, were, also, discovered, in, narmer, s, tomb, all, of, which, might, be, part, of, the, original, funerary, assemblage, the, flint, knives, and, fragment, of, a, chair, leg, were, not, included, in, any, of, petrie, s, publications, but, are, now, at, the, petrie, museum, of, egyptian, archaeology, university, college, london, registration, numbers, uc35679, uc52786, and, uc35682, according, to, dreyer, these, arrowheads, are, probably, from, the, tomb, of, djer, where, similar, arrowheads, were, found, it, is, likely, that, all, of, the, kings, of, ancient, egypt, buried, in, umm, el, qa, ab, had, funerary, enclosures, in, abydos, northern, cemetery, near, the, cultivation, line, these, were, characterized, by, large, mud, brick, walls, that, enclosed, space, in, which, funerary, ceremonies, are, believed, to, have, taken, place, eight, enclosures, have, been, excavated, two, of, which, have, not, been, definitely, identified, while, it, has, yet, to, be, confirmed, one, of, these, unidentified, funerary, enclosures, may, have, belonged, to, narmer, narmer, is, well, attested, throughout, egypt, southern, canaan, and, sinai, altogether, 98, inscriptions, at, 26, sites, at, abydos, and, hierakonpolis, narmer, s, name, appears, both, within, a, serekh, and, without, reference, to, a, serekh, at, every, other, site, except, coptos, narmer, s, name, appears, in, a, serekh, in, egypt, his, name, has, been, found, at, 17, sites, during, narmer, s, reign, egypt, had, an, active, economic, presence, in, southern, canaan, pottery, sherds, have, been, discovered, at, several, sites, both, from, pots, made, in, egypt, and, imported, to, canaan, and, others, made, in, the, egyptian, style, out, of, local, materials, twenty, serekhs, have, been, found, in, canaan, that, may, belong, to, narmer, but, seven, of, those, are, uncertain, or, controversial, these, serekhs, came, from, eight, different, sites, tel, arad, en, besor, ein, habesor, tell, es, sakan, nahal, tillah, halif, terrace, tel, erani, tel, gat, small, tel, malhata, tel, ma, ahaz, and, tel, lod, narmer, s, serekh, along, with, those, of, other, predynastic, and, early, dynastic, kings, has, been, found, at, the, wadi, ameyra, in, the, southern, sinai, where, inscriptions, commemorate, egyptian, mining, expeditions, to, the, area, first, recorded, at, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, an, important, series, of, rock, carvings, at, nag, el, hamdulab, near, aswan, was, rediscovered, in, 2009, and, its, importance, only, realized, then, among, the, many, inscriptions, tableau, 7a, shows, a, man, wearing, a, headdress, similar, to, the, white, crown, of, upper, egypt, and, carrying, a, scepter, he, is, followed, by, a, man, with, a, fan, he, is, then, preceded, by, two, men, with, standards, and, accompanied, by, a, dog, apart, from, the, dog, motif, this, scene, is, similar, to, scenes, on, the, scorpion, macehead, and, the, recto, of, the, narmer, palette, the, man, equipped, with, pharaonic, regalia, the, crown, and, scepter, can, clearly, be, identified, as, a, king, although, no, name, appears, in, the, tableau, darnell, attributes, it, to, narmer, based, on, the, iconography, and, suggests, that, it, might, represent, an, actual, visit, to, the, region, by, narmer, for, a, following, of, horus, ritual, in, an, interview, in, 2012, gatto, also, describes, the, king, in, the, inscription, as, narmer, however, hendricks, 2016, places, the, scene, slightly, before, narmer, based, in, part, on, the, uncharacteristic, absence, of, narmer, s, royal, name, in,
