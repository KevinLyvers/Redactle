sophocles, c, 497, 496, winter, 406, 405, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, tragedian, known, as, one, of, three, from, whom, at, least, one, play, has, survived, in, full, his, first, plays, were, written, later, than, or, contemporary, with, those, of, aeschylus, and, earlier, than, or, contemporary, with, those, of, euripides, sophocles, wrote, over, 120, plays, but, only, seven, have, survived, in, a, complete, form, ajax, antigone, women, of, trachis, oedipus, rex, electra, philoctetes, and, oedipus, at, colonus, for, almost, fifty, years, sophocles, was, the, most, celebrated, playwright, in, the, dramatic, competitions, of, the, city, state, of, athens, which, took, place, during, the, religious, festivals, of, the, lenaea, and, the, dionysia, he, competed, in, thirty, competitions, won, twenty, four, and, was, never, judged, lower, than, second, place, aeschylus, won, thirteen, competitions, and, was, sometimes, defeated, by, sophocles, euripides, won, four, the, most, famous, tragedies, of, sophocles, feature, oedipus, and, antigone, they, are, generally, known, as, the, theban, plays, though, each, was, part, of, a, different, tetralogy, the, other, members, of, which, are, now, lost, sophocles, influenced, the, development, of, drama, most, importantly, by, adding, a, third, actor, attributed, to, sophocles, by, aristotle, to, aeschylus, by, themistius, thereby, reducing, the, importance, of, the, chorus, in, the, presentation, of, the, plot, he, also, developed, his, characters, to, a, greater, extent, than, earlier, playwrights, sophocles, the, son, of, sophillus, was, a, wealthy, member, of, the, rural, deme, small, community, of, hippeios, colonus, in, attica, which, was, to, become, a, setting, for, one, of, his, plays, and, he, was, probably, born, there, a, few, years, before, the, battle, of, marathon, in, 490, bc, the, exact, year, is, unclear, but, 497, 6, is, most, likely, he, was, born, into, a, wealthy, family, his, father, was, an, armour, manufacturer, and, was, highly, educated, his, first, artistic, triumph, was, in, 468, bc, when, he, took, first, prize, in, the, dionysia, beating, the, reigning, master, of, athenian, drama, aeschylus, according, to, plutarch, the, victory, came, under, unusual, circumstances, instead, of, following, the, usual, custom, of, choosing, judges, by, lot, the, archon, asked, cimon, and, the, other, strategoi, present, to, decide, the, victor, of, the, contest, plutarch, further, contends, that, following, this, loss, aeschylus, soon, left, for, sicily, though, plutarch, says, that, this, was, sophocles, first, production, it, is, now, thought, that, his, first, production, was, probably, in, 470, bc, triptolemus, was, probably, one, of, the, plays, that, sophocles, presented, at, this, festival, in, 480, bc, sophocles, was, chosen, to, lead, the, paean, a, choral, chant, to, a, god, celebrating, the, greek, victory, over, the, persians, at, the, battle, of, salamis, early, in, his, career, the, politician, cimon, might, have, been, one, of, his, patrons, but, if, he, was, there, was, no, ill, will, borne, by, pericles, cimon, s, rival, when, cimon, was, ostracized, in, 461, bc, in, 443, 2, sophocles, served, as, one, of, the, hellenotamiai, or, treasurers, of, athena, helping, to, manage, the, finances, of, the, city, during, the, political, ascendancy, of, pericles, in, 441, bc, according, to, the, vita, sophoclis, he, was, elected, one, of, the, ten, generals, executive, officials, at, athens, as, a, junior, colleague, of, pericles, and, he, served, in, the, athenian, campaign, against, samos, he, was, supposed, to, have, been, elected, to, this, position, as, the, result, of, his, production, of, antigone, but, this, is, most, improbable, in, 420, bc, he, was, chosen, to, receive, the, image, of, asclepius, in, his, own, house, when, the, cult, was, being, introduced, to, athens, and, lacked, a, proper, place, for, this, he, was, given, the, posthumous, epithet, dexion, receiver, by, the, athenians, but, some, doubt, attaches, to, this, story, he, was, also, elected, in, 411, bc, one, of, the, commissioners, probouloi, who, responded, to, the, catastrophic, destruction, of, the, athenian, expeditionary, force, in, sicily, during, the, peloponnesian, war, sophocles, died, at, the, age, of, 90, or, 91, in, the, winter, of, 406, 5, bc, having, seen, within, his, lifetime, both, the, greek, triumph, in, the, persian, wars, and, the, bloodletting, of, the, peloponnesian, war, as, with, many, famous, men, in, classical, antiquity, his, death, inspired, a, number, of, apocryphal, stories, one, claimed, that, he, died, from, the, strain, of, trying, to, recite, a, long, sentence, from, his, antigone, without, pausing, to, take, a, breath, another, account, suggests, he, choked, while, eating, grapes, at, the, anthesteria, festival, in, athens, a, third, holds, that, he, died, of, happiness, after, winning, his, final, victory, at, the, city, dionysia, a, few, months, later, a, comic, poet, in, a, play, titled, the, muses, wrote, this, eulogy, blessed, is, sophocles, who, had, a, long, life, was, a, man, both, happy, and, talented, and, the, writer, of, many, good, tragedies, and, he, ended, his, life, well, without, suffering, any, misfortune, according, to, some, accounts, however, his, own, sons, tried, to, have, him, declared, incompetent, near, the, end, of, his, life, and, that, he, refuted, their, charge, in, court, by, reading, from, his, new, oedipus, at, colonus, one, of, his, sons, iophon, and, a, grandson, also, named, sophocles, son, of, ariston, also, became, playwrights, a, very, ancient, source, athenaeus, s, work, sophists, at, dinner, contains, references, to, sophocles, sexuality, in, that, work, a, character, named, myrtilus, claims, that, sophocles, was, partial, to, boys, in, the, same, way, that, euripides, was, partial, to, women, and, relates, an, anecdote, attributed, to, ion, of, chios, of, sophocles, flirting, with, a, serving, boy, at, a, symposium, do, you, want, me, to, enjoy, my, drink, then, hand, me, the, cup, nice, and, slow, and, take, it, back, nice, and, slow, too, he, also, says, that, hieronymus, of, rhodes, in, his, historical, notes, claims, that, sophocles, once, led, a, boy, outside, the, city, walls, for, sex, and, that, the, boy, snatched, sophocles, cloak, khlanis, leaving, his, own, child, sized, robe, for, sophocles, moreover, when, euripides, heard, about, this, it, was, much, discussed, he, mocked, the, disdainful, treatment, saying, that, he, had, himself, had, sex, with, the, boy, but, had, not, given, him, anything, more, than, his, usual, fee, or, but, that, nothing, had, been, taken, off, in, response, sophocles, composed, this, elegy, it, was, the, sun, euripides, and, not, a, boy, that, got, me, hot, and, stripped, me, naked, but, the, north, wind, was, with, you, when, you, were, kissing, a, courtesan, you, re, not, so, clever, if, you, arrest, eros, for, stealing, clothes, while, you, re, sowing, another, man, s, field, sophocles, is, known, for, innovations, in, dramatic, structure, deeper, development, of, characters, than, earlier, playwrights, and, if, it, was, not, aeschylus, the, addition, of, a, third, actor, which, further, reduced, the, role, of, the, chorus, and, increased, opportunities, for, development, and, conflict, aeschylus, who, dominated, athenian, playwriting, during, sophocles, early, career, adopted, the, third, actor, into, his, own, work, besides, the, third, actor, aristotle, credits, sophocles, with, the, introduction, of, skenographia, or, scenery, painting, but, this, too, is, attributed, elsewhere, to, someone, else, by, vitruvius, to, agatharchus, of, samos, after, aeschylus, died, in, 456, bc, sophocles, became, the, pre, eminent, playwright, in, athens, winning, competitions, at, eighteen, dionysia, and, six, lenaia, festivals, his, reputation, was, such, that, foreign, rulers, invited, him, to, attend, their, courts, but, unlike, aeschylus, who, died, in, sicily, or, euripides, who, spent, time, in, macedon, sophocles, never, accepted, any, of, these, invitations, aristotle, in, his, poetics, c, 335, bc, used, sophocles, oedipus, rex, as, an, example, of, the, highest, achievement, in, tragedy, only, two, of, the, seven, surviving, plays, can, be, dated, securely, philoctetes, to, 409, bc, and, oedipus, at, colonus, to, 401, bc, staged, after, his, death, by, his, grandson, of, the, others, electra, shows, stylistic, similarities, to, these, two, suggesting, that, it, was, probably, written, in, the, later, part, of, his, career, ajax, antigone, and, the, trachiniae, are, generally, thought, early, again, based, on, stylistic, elements, and, oedipus, rex, is, put, in, a, middle, period, most, of, sophocles, plays, show, an, undercurrent, of, early, fatalism, and, the, beginnings, of, socratic, logic, as, a, mainstay, for, the, long, tradition, of, greek, tragedy, the, theban, plays, comprise, three, plays, oedipus, rex, also, called, oedipus, tyrannus, or, oedipus, the, king, oedipus, at, colonus, and, antigone, all, three, concern, the, fate, of, thebes, during, and, after, the, reign, of, king, oedipus, they, have, often, been, published, under, a, single, cover, but, sophocles, wrote, them, for, separate, festival, competitions, many, years, apart, the, theban, plays, are, not, a, proper, trilogy, i, e, three, plays, presented, as, a, continuous, narrative, nor, an, intentional, series, they, contain, inconsistencies, sophocles, also, wrote, other, plays, pertaining, to, thebes, such, as, the, epigoni, but, only, fragments, have, survived, the, three, plays, involve, the, tale, of, oedipus, who, kills, his, father, and, marries, his, mother, not, knowing, they, are, his, parents, his, family, is, cursed, for, three, generations, in, oedipus, rex, oedipus, is, the, protagonist, his, infanticide, is, planned, by, his, parents, laius, and, jocasta, to, prevent, him, fulfilling, a, prophecy, but, the, servant, entrusted, with, the, infanticide, passes, the, infant, on, through, a, series, of, intermediaries, to, a, childless, couple, who, adopt, him, not, knowing, his, history, oedipus, eventually, learns, of, the, delphic, oracle, s, prophecy, of, him, that, he, would, kill, his, father, and, marry, his, mother, he, attempts, to, flee, his, fate, without, harming, those, he, knows, as, his, parents, at, this, point, he, does, not, know, that, he, is, adopted, oedipus, meets, a, man, at, a, crossroads, accompanied, by, servants, oedipus, and, the, man, fight, and, oedipus, kills, the, man, who, was, his, father, laius, although, neither, knew, at, the, time, he, becomes, the, ruler, of, thebes, after, solving, the, riddle, of, the, sphinx, and, in, the, process, marries, the, widowed, queen, his, mother, jocasta, thus, the, stage, is, set, for, horror, when, the, truth, comes, out, following, from, another, true, but, confusing, prophecy, from, delphi, jocasta, commits, suicide, oedipus, blinds, himself, and, leaves, thebes, at, the, end, of, the, play, order, is, restored, this, restoration, is, seen, when, creon, brother, of, jocasta, becomes, king, and, also, when, oedipus, before, going, off, to, exile, asks, creon, to, take, care, of, his, children, oedipus, s, children, will, always, bear, the, weight, of, shame, and, humiliation, because, of, their, father, s, actions, in, oedipus, at, colonus, the, banished, oedipus, and, his, daughter, antigone, arrive, at, the, town, of, colonus, where, they, encounter, theseus, king, of, athens, oedipus, dies, and, strife, begins, between, his, sons, polyneices, and, eteocles, they, fight, and, simultaneously, run, each, other, through, in, antigone, the, protagonist, is, oedipus, daughter, antigone, she, is, faced, with, the, choice, of, allowing, her, brother, polyneices, body, to, remain, unburied, outside, the, city, walls, exposed, to, the, ravages, of, wild, animals, or, to, bury, him, and, face, death, the, king, of, the, land, creon, has, forbidden, the, burial, of, polyneices, for, he, was, a, traitor, to, the, city, antigone, decides, to, bury, his, body, and, face, the, consequences, of, her, actions, creon, sentences, her, to, death, eventually, creon, is, persuaded, to, free, antigone, from, her, punishment, but, his, decision, comes, too, late, and, antigone, commits, suicide, her, suicide, triggers, the, suicide, of, two, others, close, to, king, creon, his, son, haemon, who, was, to, wed, antigone, and, his, wife, eurydice, who, commits, suicide, after, losing, her, only, surviving, son, the, plays, were, written, across, thirty, six, years, of, sophocles, career, and, were, not, composed, in, chronological, order, but, instead, were, written, in, the, order, antigone, oedipus, rex, and, oedipus, at, colonus, nor, were, they, composed, as, a, trilogy, a, group, of, plays, to, be, performed, together, but, are, the, remaining, parts, of, three, different, groups, of, plays, as, a, result, there, are, some, inconsistencies, notably, creon, is, the, undisputed, king, at, the, end, of, oedipus, rex, and, in, consultation, with, apollo, single, handedly, makes, the, decision, to, expel, oedipus, from, thebes, creon, is, also, instructed, to, look, after, oedipus, daughters, antigone, and, ismene, at, the, end, of, oedipus, rex, by, contrast, in, the, other, plays, there, is, some, struggle, with, oedipus, sons, eteocles, and, polynices, in, regard, to, the, succession, in, oedipus, at, colonus, sophocles, attempts, to, work, these, inconsistencies, into, a, coherent, whole, ismene, explains, that, in, light, of, their, tainted, family, lineage, her, brothers, were, at, first, willing, to, cede, the, throne, to, creon, nevertheless, they, eventually, decided, to, take, charge, of, the, monarchy, with, each, brother, disputing, the, other, s, right, to, succeed, in, addition, to, being, in, a, clearly, more, powerful, position, in, oedipus, at, colonus, eteocles, and, polynices, are, also, culpable, they, consent, l, 429, theodoridis, tr, to, their, father, s, going, to, exile, which, is, one, of, his, bitterest, charges, against, them, in, addition, to, the, three, theban, plays, there, are, four, surviving, plays, by, sophocles, ajax, women, of, trachis, electra, and, philoctetes, the, last, of, which, won, first, prize, in, 409, bc, ajax, focuses, on, the, proud, hero, of, the, trojan, war, telamonian, ajax, who, is, driven, to, treachery, and, eventually, suicide, ajax, becomes, gravely, upset, when, achilles, armor, is, presented, to, odysseus, instead, of, himself, despite, their, enmity, toward, him, odysseus, persuades, the, kings, menelaus, and, agamemnon, to, grant, ajax, a, proper, burial, the, women, of, trachis, named, for, the, trachinian, women, who, make, up, the, chorus, dramatizes, deianeira, s, accidentally, killing, heracles, after, he, had, completed, his, famous, twelve, labors, tricked, into, thinking, it, is, a, love, charm, deianeira, applies, poison, to, an, article, of, heracles, clothing, this, poisoned, robe, causes, heracles, to, die, an, excruciating, death, upon, learning, the, truth, deianeira, commits, suicide, electra, corresponds, roughly, to, the, plot, of, aeschylus, libation, bearers, it, details, how, electra, and, orestes, avenge, their, father, agamemnon, s, murder, by, clytemnestra, and, aegisthus, philoctetes, retells, the, story, of, philoctetes, an, archer, who, had, been, abandoned, on, lemnos, by, the, rest, of, the, greek, fleet, while, on, the, way, to, troy, after, learning, that, they, cannot, win, the, trojan, war, without, philoctetes, bow, the, greeks, send, odysseus, and, neoptolemus, to, retrieve, him, due, to, the, greeks, earlier, treachery, however, philoctetes, refuses, to, rejoin, the, army, it, is, only, heracles, deus, ex, machina, appearance, that, persuades, philoctetes, to, go, to, troy, although, more, than, 120, titles, of, plays, associated, with, sophocles, are, known, and, presented, below, little, is, known, of, the, precise, dating, of, most, of, them, philoctetes, is, known, to, have, been, written, in, 409, bc, and, oedipus, at, colonus, is, known, to, have, only, been, performed, in, 401, bc, posthumously, at, the, initiation, of, sophocles, grandson, the, convention, on, writing, plays, for, the, greek, festivals, was, to, submit, them, in, tetralogies, of, three, tragedies, along, with, one, satyr, play, along, with, the, unknown, dating, of, the, vast, majority, of, more, than, 120, plays, it, is, also, largely, unknown, how, the, plays, were, grouped, it, is, however, known, that, the, three, plays, referred, to, in, the, modern, era, as, the, theban, plays, were, never, performed, together, in, sophocles, own, lifetime, and, are, therefore, not, a, trilogy, which, they, are, sometimes, erroneously, seen, as, fragments, of, ichneutae, tracking, satyrs, were, discovered, in, egypt, in, 1907, these, amount, to, about, half, of, the, play, making, it, the, best, preserved, satyr, play, after, euripides, cyclops, which, survives, in, its, entirety, fragments, of, the, epigoni, were, discovered, in, april, 2005, by, classicists, at, oxford, university, with, the, help, of, infrared, technology, previously, used, for, satellite, imaging, the, tragedy, tells, the, story, of, the, second, siege, of, thebes, a, number, of, other, sophoclean, works, have, survived, only, in, fragments, including, there, is, a, passage, of, plutarch, s, tract, de, profectibus, in, virtute, 7, in, which, sophocles, discusses, his, own, growth, as, a, writer, a, likely, source, of, this, material, for, plutarch, was, the, epidemiae, of, ion, of, chios, a, book, that, recorded, many, conversations, of, sophocles, but, a, hellenistic, dialogue, about, tragedy, in, which, sophocles, appeared, as, a, character, is, also, plausible, the, former, is, a, likely, candidate, to, have, contained, sophocles, discourse, on, his, own, development, because, ion, was, a, friend, of, sophocles, and, the, book, is, known, to, have, been, used, by, plutarch, though, some, interpretations, of, plutarch, s, words, suggest, that, sophocles, says, that, he, imitated, aeschylus, the, translation, does, not, fit, grammatically, nor, does, the, interpretation, that, sophocles, said, that, he, was, making, fun, of, aeschylus, works, c, m, bowra, argues, for, the, following, translation, of, the, line, after, practising, to, the, full, the, bigness, of, aeschylus, then, the, painful, ingenuity, of, my, own, invention, now, in, the, third, stage, i, am, changing, to, the, kind, of, diction, which, is, most, expressive, of, character, and, best, here, sophocles, says, that, he, has, completed, a, stage, of, aeschylus, work, meaning, that, he, went, through, a, phase, of, imitating, aeschylus, style, but, is, finished, with, that, sophocles, opinion, of, aeschylus, was, mixed, he, certainly, respected, him, enough, to, imitate, his, work, early, on, in, his, career, but, he, had, reservations, about, aeschylus, style, and, thus, did, not, keep, his, imitation, up, sophocles, first, stage, in, which, he, imitated, aeschylus, is, marked, by, aeschylean, pomp, in, the, language, sophocles, second, stage, was, entirely, his, own, he, introduced, new, ways, of, evoking, feeling, out, of, an, audience, as, in, his, ajax, when, ajax, is, mocked, by, athene, then, the, stage, is, emptied, so, that, he, may, commit, suicide, alone, sophocles, mentions, a, third, stage, distinct, from, the, other, two, in, his, discussion, of, his, development, the, third, stage, pays, more, heed, to, diction, his, characters, spoke, in, a, way, that, was, more, natural, to, them, and, more, expressive, of, their, individual, character, feelings
