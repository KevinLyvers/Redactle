accepted, a, gift, made, to, the, graduate, school, campaign, subject, to, the, graduate, school, being, located, off, campus, wilson, became, disenchanted, with, his, job, as, princeton, university, president, due, to, the, resistance, to, his, recommendations, and, he, began, considering, a, run, for, political, office, prior, to, the, 1908, democratic, national, convention, wilson, dropped, hints, to, some, influential, players, in, the, democratic, party, of, his, interest, in, the, ticket, while, he, had, no, real, expectations, of, being, placed, on, it, wilson, left, instructions, that, he, should, not, be, offered, the, vice, presidential, nomination, party, regulars, considered, his, ideas, politically, and, geographically, detached, and, fanciful, but, the, seeds, of, interest, had, been, sown, in, 1956, mcgeorge, bundy, described, wilson, s, contribution, to, princeton, wilson, was, right, in, his, conviction, that, princeton, must, be, more, than, a, wonderfully, pleasant, and, decent, home, for, nice, young, men, it, has, been, more, ever, since, his, time, by, january, 1910, wilson, had, drawn, the, attention, of, james, smith, jr, and, george, brinton, mcclellan, harvey, two, leaders, of, new, jersey, s, democratic, party, as, a, potential, candidate, in, the, upcoming, gubernatorial, election, having, lost, the, last, five, gubernatorial, elections, new, jersey, democratic, leaders, decided, to, throw, their, support, behind, wilson, an, untested, and, unconventional, candidate, party, leaders, believed, that, wilson, s, academic, reputation, made, him, the, ideal, spokesman, against, trusts, and, corruption, but, they, also, hoped, his, inexperience, in, governing, would, make, him, easy, to, influence, wilson, agreed, to, accept, the, nomination, if, it, came, to, me, unsought, unanimously, and, without, pledges, to, anybody, about, anything, at, the, state, party, convention, the, bosses, marshaled, their, forces, and, won, the, nomination, for, wilson, on, october, 20, wilson, submitted, his, letter, of, resignation, to, princeton, university, wilson, s, campaign, focused, on, his, promise, to, be, independent, of, party, bosses, he, quickly, shed, his, professorial, style, for, more, emboldened, speechmaking, and, presented, himself, as, a, full, fledged, progressive, though, republican, william, howard, taft, had, carried, new, jersey, in, the, 1908, presidential, election, by, more, than, 82, 000, votes, wilson, soundly, defeated, republican, gubernatorial, nominee, vivian, m,

after, winning, the, election, wilson, appointed, joseph, patrick, tumulty, as, his, private, secretary, a, position, he, held, throughout, wilson, s, political, career, wilson, began, formulating, his, reformist, agenda, intending, to, ignore, the, demands, of, his, party, machinery, smith, asked, wilson, to, endorse, his, bid, for, the, u, s, senate, but, wilson, refused, and, instead, endorsed, smith, s, opponent, james, edgar, martine, who, had, won, the, democratic, primary, martine, s, victory, in, the, senate, election, helped, wilson, position, himself, as, an, independent, force, in, the, new, jersey, democratic, party, by, the, time, wilson, took, office, new, jersey, had, gained, a, reputation, for, public, corruption, the, state, was, known, as, the, mother, of, trusts, because, it, allowed, companies, like, standard, oil, to, escape, the, antitrust, laws, of, other, states, wilson, and, his, allies, quickly, won, passage, of, the, geran, bill, which, undercut, the, power, of, the, political, bosses, by, requiring, primaries, for, all, elective, offices, and, party, officials, a, corrupt, practices, law, and, a, workmen, s, compensation, statute, that, wilson, supported, won, passage, shortly, thereafter, for, his, success, in, passing, these, laws, during, the, first, months, of, his, gubernatorial, term, wilson, won, national, and, bipartisan, recognition, as, a, reformer, and, a, leader, of, the, progressive, movement, republicans, took, control, of, the, state, assembly, in, early, 1912, and, wilson, spent, much, of, the,

carried, out, shortly, before, leaving, office, wilson, signed, a, series, of, antitrust, laws, known, as, the, seven, sisters, as, well, as, another, law, that, removed, the, power, to, select, juries, from, local, sheriffs, wilson, became, a, prominent, 1912, presidential, contender, immediately, upon, his, election, as, governor, of, new, jersey, in, 1910, and, his, clashes, with, state, party, bosses, enhanced, his, reputation, with, the, rising, progressive, movement, in, addition, to, progressives, wilson, enjoyed, the, support, of, princeton, alumni, such, as, cyrus, mccormick, and, southerners, such, as, walter, hines, page, who, believed, that, wilson, s, status, as, a, transplanted, southerner, gave, him, broad, appeal, though, wilson, s, shift, to, the, left, won, the, admiration, of, many, it, also, created, enemies, such, as, george, brinton, mcclellan, harvey, a, former, wilson, supporter, who, had, close, ties, to, wall, street, in, july, 1911, wilson, brought, william, gibbs, mcadoo, and, colonel, edward, m, house, in, to, manage, the, campaign, prior, to, the, 1912, democratic, national, convention, wilson, made, a, special, effort, to, win, the, approval, of, three, time, democratic, presidential, nominee, william, jennings, bryan, whose, followers, had, largely, dominated, the, democratic, party, since, the, 1896, presidential, election, speaker, of, the, house, champ, clark, of, missouri, was, viewed, by, many, as, the, front, runner, for, the, nomination, while, house, majority, leader, oscar, underwood, of, alabama, also, loomed, as, a, challenger, clark, found, support, among, the, bryan, wing, of, the, party, while, underwood, appealed, to, the, conservative, bourbon, democrats, especially, in, the, south, in, the, 1912, democratic, party, presidential, primaries, clark, won, several, of, the, early, contests, but, wilson, finished, strong, with, victories, in, texas, the, northeast, and, the, midwest, on, the, first,

on, the, tenth, ballot, tammany, s, support, backfired, for, clark, as, bryan, announced, that, he, would, not, support, any, candidate, that, had, tammany, s, backing, and, clark, began, losing, delegates, on, subsequent, ballots, wilson, gained, the, support, of, roger, charles, sullivan, and, thomas, taggart, by, promising, the, vice, presidency, to, governor, thomas, r, marshall, of,

marshall, became, wilson, s, running, mate, in, the, 1912, general, election, wilson, faced, two, major, opponents, one, term, republican, incumbent, william, howard, taft, and, former, republican, president, theodore, roosevelt, who, ran, a, third, party, campaign, as, the, bull, moose, party, nominee, the, fourth, candidate, was, eugene, v, debs, of, the, socialist, party, roosevelt, had, broken, with, his, former, party, at, the, 1912, republican, national, convention, after, taft, narrowly, won, re, nomination, and, the, split, in, the, republican, party, made, democrats, hopeful, that, they, could, win, the, presidency, for, the, first, time, since, the, 1892, presidential, election, roosevelt, emerged, as, wilson, s, main, challenger, and, wilson, and, roosevelt, largely, campaigned, against, each, other, despite, sharing, similarly, progressive, platforms, that, called, for, an, interventionist, central, government, wilson, directed, campaign, finance, chairman, henry, morgenthau, not, to, accept, contributions, from, corporations, and, to, prioritize, smaller, donations, from, the, widest, possible, quarters, of, the, public, during, the, election, campaign, wilson, asserted, that, it, was, the, task, of, government, to, make, those, adjustments, of, life, which, will, put, every, man, in, a, position, to, claim, his, normal, rights, as, a, living, human, being, with, the, help, of, legal, scholar, louis, brandeis, he, developed, his, new, freedom, platform, focusing, especially, on, breaking, up, trusts, and, lowering, tariff, rates, brandeis, and, wilson, rejected, roosevelt, s, proposal, to, establish, a, powerful, bureaucracy, charged, with, regulating, large, corporations, instead, favoring, the, break, up, of, large, corporations, in, order, to, create, a, level, economic, playing, field, wilson, engaged, in, a, spirited, campaign, criss, crossing, the, country, to, deliver, numerous, speeches, ultimately, he, took, 42, percent, of, the, popular, vote, and, 435, of, the, 531, electoral, votes, roosevelt, won, most, of, the, remaining, electoral, votes, and, 27, 4, percent, of, the, popular, vote, one, of, the, strongest, third, party, performances, in, u, s, history, taft, won, 23, 2, percent, of, the, popular, vote, but, just, 8, electoral, votes, while, debs, won, 6, percent, of, the, popular, vote, in, the, concurrent, congressional, elections, democrats, retained, control, of, the, house, and, won, a, majority, in, the, senate, wilson, s, victory, made, him, the, first, southerner, to, win, a, presidential, election, since, the, civil, war, the, first, democratic, president, since, grover, cleveland, left, office, in, 1897, and, the, first, and, only, president, to, hold, a, ph, d, after, the, election, wilson, chose, william, jennings, bryan, as, secretary, of, state, and, bryan, offered, advice, on, the, remaining, members, of, wilson, s, cabinet, william, gibbs, mcadoo, a, prominent, wilson, supporter, who, married, wilson, s, daughter, in, 1914, became, secretary, of, the, treasury, and, james, clark, mcreynolds, who, had, successfully, prosecuted, several, prominent, antitrust, cases, was, chosen, as, attorney, general, publisher, josephus, daniels, a, party, loyalist, and, prominent, white, supremacist, from, north, carolina, was, chosen, to, be, secretary, of, the, navy, while, young, new, york, attorney, franklin, d, roosevelt, became, assistant, secretary, of, the, navy, wilson, s, chief, of, staff, secretary, was, joseph, patrick, tumulty, who, acted, as, a, political, buffer, and, intermediary, with, the, press, the, most, important, foreign, policy, adviser, and, confidant, was, colonel, edward, m, house, berg, writes, that, in, access, and, influence, outranked, everybody, in, wilson, s, cabinet, wilson, introduced, a, comprehensive, program, of, domestic, legislation, at, the, outset, of, his, administration, something, no, president, had, ever, done, before, he, announced, four, major, domestic, priorities, the, conservation, of, natural, resources, banking, reform, tariff, reduction, and, better, access, to, raw, materials, for, farmers, by, breaking, up, western, mining, trusts, wilson, introduced, these, proposals, in, april, 1913, in, a, speech, delivered, to, a, joint, session, of, congress, becoming, the, first, president, since, john, adams, to, address, congress, in, person, wilson, s, first, two, years, in, office, largely, focused, on, his, domestic, agenda, with, trouble, with, mexico, and, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, 1914, foreign, affairs, increasingly, dominated, his, presidency, democrats, had, long, seen, high, tariff, rates, as, equivalent, to, unfair, taxes, on, consumers, and, tariff, reduction, was, their, first, priority, he, argued, that, the, system, of, high, tariffs, cuts, us, off, from, our, proper, part, in, the, commerce, of, the, world, violates, the, just, principles, of, taxation, and, makes, the, government, a, facile, instrument, in, the, hands, of, private, interests, by, late, may, 1913, house, majority, leader, oscar, underwood, had, passed, a, bill, in, the, house, that, cut, the, average, tariff, rate, by, 10, percent, and, imposed, a, tax, on, personal, income, above, 4, 000, underwood, s, bill, represented, the, largest, downward, revision, of, the, tariff, since, the, civil, war, it, aggressively, cut, rates, for, raw, materials, goods, deemed, to, be, necessities, and, products, produced, domestically, by, trusts, but, it, retained, higher, tariff, rates, for, luxury, goods, nevertheless, the, passage, of, the, tariff, bill, in, the, senate, was, a, challenge, some, southern, and, western, democrats, wanted, the, continued, protection, of, their, wool, and, sugar, industries, and, democrats, had, a, narrower, majority, in, the, upper, house, wilson, met, extensively, with, democratic, senators, and, appealed, directly, to, the, people, through, the, press, after, weeks, of, hearings, and, debate, wilson, and, secretary, of, state, bryan, managed, to, unite, senate, democrats, behind, the, bill, the, senate, voted, 44, to, 37, in, favor, of, the, bill, with, only, one, democrat, voting, against, it, and, only, one, republican, voting, for, it, wilson, signed, the, revenue, act, of, 1913, called, the, underwood, tariff, into, law, on, october, 3, 1913, the, revenue, act, of, 1913, reduced, tariffs, and, replaced, the, lost, revenue, with, a, federal, income, tax, of, one, percent, on, incomes, above, 3, 000, affecting, the, richest, three, percent, of, the, population, the, policies, of, the, wilson, administration, had, a, durable, impact, on, the, composition, of, government, revenue, which, now, primarily, came, from, taxation, rather, than, tariffs, wilson, did, not, wait, to, complete, the, revenue, act, of, 1913, before, proceeding, to, the, next, item, on, his, agenda, banking, by, the, time, wilson, took, office, countries, like, britain, and, germany, had, established, government, run, central, banks, but, the, united, states, had, not, had, a, central, bank, since, the, bank, war, of, the, 1830s, in, the, aftermath, of, the, nationwide, financial, crisis, in, 1907, there, was, general, agreement, to, create, some, sort, of, central, banking, system, to, provide, a, more, elastic, currency, and, to, coordinate, responses, to, financial, panics, wilson, sought, a, middle, ground, between, progressives, such, as, bryan, and, conservative, republicans, like, nelson, aldrich, who, as, chairman, of, the, national, monetary, commission, had, put, forward, a, plan, for, a, central, bank, that, would, give, private, financial, interests, a, large, degree, of, control, over, the, monetary, system, wilson, declared, that, the, banking, system, must, be, public, not, private, must, be, vested, in, the, government, itself, so, that, the, banks, must, be, the, instruments, not, the, masters, of, business, democrats, crafted, a, compromise, plan, in, which, private, banks, would, control, twelve, regional, federal, reserve, banks, but, a, controlling, interest, in, the, system, was, placed, in, a, central, board, filled, with, presidential, appointees, wilson, convinced, democrats, on, the, left, that, the, new, plan, met, their, demands, finally, the, senate, voted, 54, 34, to, approve, the, federal, reserve, act, the, new, system, began, operations, in, 1915, and, it, played, a, key, role, in, financing, the, allied, and, american, war, efforts, in, world, war, i, having, passed, major, legislation, lowering, the, tariff, and, reforming, the, banking, structure, wilson, next, sought, antitrust, legislation, to, enhance, the, sherman, antitrust, act, of, 1890, the, sherman, antitrust, act, barred, any, contract, combination, or, conspiracy, in, restraint, of, trade, but, had, proved, ineffective, in, preventing, the, rise, of, large, business, combinations, known, as, trusts, an, elite, group, of, businessmen, dominated, the, boards, of, major, banks, and, railroads, and, they, used, their, power, to, prevent, competition, by, new, companies, with, wilson, s, support, congressman, henry, clayton, jr, introduced, a, bill, that, would, ban, several, anti, competitive, practices, such, as, discriminatory, pricing, tying, exclusive, dealing, and, interlocking, directorates, as, the, difficulty, of, banning, all, anti, competitive, practices, via, legislation, became, clear, wilson, came, to, back, legislation, that, would, create, a, new, agency, the, federal, trade, commission, ftc, to, investigate, antitrust, violations, and, enforce, antitrust, laws, independently, of, the, justice, department, with, bipartisan, support, congress, passed, the, federal, trade, commission, act, of, 1914, which, incorporated, wilson, s, ideas, regarding, the, ftc, one, month, after, signing, the, federal, trade, commission, act, of, 1914, wilson, signed, the, clayton, antitrust, act, of, 1914, which, built, on, the, sherman, act, by, defining, and, banning, several, anti, competitive, practices, wilson, thought, a, child, labor, law, would, probably, be, unconstitutional, but, reversed, himself, in, 1916, with, a, close, election, approaching, in, 1916, after, intense, campaigns, by, the, national, child, labor, committee, nclc, and, the, national, consumers, league, the, congress, passed, the, keating, owen, act, making, it, illegal, to, ship, goods, in, interstate, commerce, if, they, were, made, in, factories, employing, children, under, specified, ages, southern, democrats, were, opposed, but, did, not, filibuster, wilson, endorsed, the, bill, at, the, last, minute, under, pressure, from, party, leaders, who, stressed, how, popular, the, idea, was, especially, among, the, emerging, class, of, women, voters, he, told, democratic, congressmen, they, needed, to, pass, this, law, and, also, a, workman, s, compensation, law, to, satisfy, the, national, progressive, movement, and, to, win, the, 1916, election, against, a, reunited, gop, it, was, the, first, federal, child, labor, law, however, the, u, s, supreme, court, struck, down, the, law, in, hammer, v, dagenhart, 1918, congress, then, passed, a, law, taxing, businesses, that, used, child, labor, but, that, was, struck, down, by, the, supreme, court, in, bailey, v, drexel, furniture, 1923, child, labor, was, finally, ended, in, the, 1930s, he, approved, the, goal, of, upgrading, the, harsh, working, conditions, for, merchant, sailors, and, signed, lafollette, s, seamen, s, act, of, 1915, wilson, called, on, the, labor, department, to, mediate, conflicts, between, labor, and, management, in, 1914, wilson, dispatched, soldiers, to, help, bring, an, end, to, the, colorado, coalfield, war, one, of, the, deadliest, labor, disputes, in, american, history, in, 1916, he, pushed, congress, to, enact, the, eight, hour, work, day, for, railroad, workers, which, ended, a, major, strike, it, was, the, boldest, intervention, in, labor, relations, that, any, president, had, yet, attempted, wilson, disliked, the, excessive, government, involvement, in, the, federal, farm, loan, act, which, created, twelve, regional, banks, empowered, to, provide, low, interest, loans, to, farmers, nevertheless, he, needed, the, farm, vote, to, survive, the, upcoming, 1916, election, so, he, signed, it, wilson, embraced, the, long, standing, democratic, policy, against, owning, colonies, and, he, worked, for, the, gradual, autonomy, and, ultimate, independence, of, the, philippines, which, had, been, acquired, in, 1898, continuing, the, policy, of, his, predecessors, wilson, increased, self, governance, on, the, islands, by, granting, filipinos, greater, control, over, the, philippine, legislature, the, jones, act, of, 1916, committed, the, united, states, to, the, eventual, independence, of, the, philippines, and, granted, filipinos, further, autonomy, with, the, establishment, of, a, filipino, senate, and, house, of, representatives, replacing, the, american, run, philippine, commission, and, filipino, run, philippine, assembly, respectively, in, 1916, wilson, purchased, by, treaty, the, danish, west, indies, renamed, as, the, united, states, virgin, islands, immigration, from, europe, declined, significantly, once, world, war, i, began, and, wilson, paid, little, attention, to, the, issue, during, his, presidency, however, he, looked, favorably, upon, the, new, immigrants, from, southern, and, eastern, europe, and, twice, vetoed, laws, passed, by, congress, intended, to, restrict, their, entry, though, the, later, veto, was, overridden, wilson, nominated, three, men, to, the, united, states, supreme, court, all, of, whom, were, confirmed, by, the, u, s, senate, in, 1914, wilson, nominated, sitting, attorney, general, james, clark, mcreynolds, despite, his, credentials, as, an, ardent, trust, buster, mcreynolds, became, a, staple, of, the, court, s, conservative, bloc, until, his, retirement, in, 1941, according, to, berg, wilson, considered, appointing, mcreynolds, one, of, his, biggest, mistakes, in, office, in, 1916, wilson, nominated, louis, brandeis, to, the, court, setting, off, a, major, debate, in, the, senate, over, brandeis, s, progressive, ideology, and, his, religion, brandeis, was, the, first, jewish, nominee, to, the, supreme, court, ultimately, wilson, was, able, to, convince, senate, democrats, to, vote, to, confirm, brandeis, who, served, on, the, court, until, 1939, in, contrast, to, mcreynolds, brandeis, became, one, of, the, court, s, leading, progressive, voices, when, a, second, vacancy, arose, in, 1916, wilson, appointed, progressive, lawyer, john, hessin, clarke, clarke, was, confirmed, by, the, senate, and, served, on, the, court, until, retiring, in, 1922, wilson, sought, to, move, away, from, the, foreign, policy, of, his, predecessors, which, he, viewed, as, imperialistic, and, he, rejected, taft, s, dollar, diplomacy, nonetheless, he, frequently, intervened, in, latin, america, saying, in, 1913, i, am, going, to, teach, the, south, american, republics, to, elect, good, men, the, 1914, bryan, chamorro, treaty, converted, nicaragua, into, a, de, facto, protectorate, and, the, u, s, stationed, soldiers, there, throughout, wilson, s, presidency, the, wilson, administration, sent, troops, to, occupy, the, dominican, republic, and, intervene, in, haiti, and, wilson, also, authorized, military, interventions, in, cuba, panama, and, honduras, wilson, took, office, during, the, mexican, revolution, which, had, begun, in, 1911, after, liberals, overthrew, the, military, dictatorship, of, porfirio, d, az, shortly, before, wilson, took, office, conservatives, retook, power, through, a, coup, led, by, victoriano, huerta, wilson, rejected, the, legitimacy, of, huerta, s, government, of, butchers, and, demanded, mexico, hold, democratic, elections, after, huerta, arrested, u, s, navy, personnel, who, had, accidentally, landed, in, a, restricted, zone, near, the, northern, port, town, of, tampico, wilson, dispatched, the, navy, to, occupy, the, mexican, city, of, veracruz, a, strong, backlash, against, the, american, intervention, among, mexicans, of, all, political, affiliations, convinced, wilson, to, abandon, his, plans, to, expand, the, u, s, military, intervention, but, the, intervention, nonetheless, helped, convince, huerta, to, flee, from, the, country, a, group, led, by, venustiano, carranza, established, control, over, a, significant, proportion, of, mexico, and, wilson, recognized, carranza, s, government, in, october, 1915, carranza, continued, to, face, various, opponents, within, mexico, including, pancho, villa, whom, wilson, had, earlier, described, as, a, sort, of, robin, hood, in, early, 1916, pancho, villa, raided, the, village, of, columbus, new, mexico, killing, or, wounding, dozens, of, americans, and, causing, an, enormous, nationwide, american, demand, for, his, punishment, wilson, ordered, general, john, j, pershing, and, 4, 000, troops, across, the, border, to, capture, villa, by, april, pershing, s, forces, had, broken, up, and, dispersed, villa, s, bands, but, villa, remained, on, the, loose, and, pershing, continued, his, pursuit, deep, into, mexico, carranza, then, pivoted, against, the, americans, and, accused, them, of, a, punitive, invasion, leading, to, several, incidents, that, nearly, led, to, war, tensions, subsided, after, mexico, agreed, to, release, several, american, prisoners, and, bilateral, negotiations, began, under, the, auspices, of, the, mexican, american, joint, high, commission, eager, to, withdraw, from, mexico, due, to, tensions, in, europe, wilson, ordered, pershing, to, withdraw, and, the, last, american, soldiers, left, in, february, 1917, world, war, i, broke, out, in, july, 1914, pitting, the, central, powers, germany, austria, hungary, the, ottoman, empire, and, later, bulgaria, against, the, allied, powers, britain, france, russia, serbia, and, several, other, countries, the, war, fell, into, a, long, stalemate, with, very, high, casualties, on, the, western, front, in, france, both, sides, rejected, offers, by, wilson, and, the, house, to, mediate, an, end, to, the, conflict, from, 1914, until, early, 1917, wilson, s, primary, foreign, policy, objectives, were, to, keep, the, united, states, out, of, the, war, in, europe, and, to, broker, a, peace, agreement, he, insisted, that, all, u, s, government, actions, be, neutral, stating, that, americans, must, be, impartial, in, thought, as, well, as, in, action, must, put, a, curb, upon, our, sentiments, as, well, as, upon, every, transaction, that, might, be, construed, as, a, preference, of, one, party, to, the, struggle, before, another, as, a, neutral, power, the, u, s, insisted, on, its, right, to, trade, with, both, sides, however, the, powerful, british, royal, navy, imposed, a, blockade, of, germany, to, appease, washington, london, agreed, to, continue, purchasing, certain, major, american, commodities, such, as, cotton, at, pre, war, prices, and, in, the, event, an, american, merchant, vessel, was, caught, with, contraband, the, royal, navy, was, under, orders, to, buy, the, entire, cargo, and, release, the, vessel, wilson, passively, accepted, this, situation, in, response, to, the, british, blockade, germany, launched, a, submarine, campaign, against, merchant, vessels, in, the, seas, surrounding, the, british, isles, in, early, 1915, the, germans, sank, three, american, ships, wilson, took, the, view, based, on, some, reasonable, evidence, that, these, incidents, were, accidental, and, a, settlement, of, claims, could, be, postponed, until, the, end, of, the, war, in, may, 1915, a, german, submarine, torpedoed, the, british, ocean, liner, rms, lusitania, killing, 1, 198, passengers, including, 128, american, citizens, wilson, publicly, responded, by, saying, there, is, such, a, thing, as, a, man, being, too, proud, to, fight, there, is, such, a, thing, as, a, nation, being, so, right, that, it, does, not, need, to, convince, others, by, force, that, it, is, right, wilson, demanded, that, the, german, government, take, immediate, steps, to, prevent, the, recurrence, of, incidents, like, the, sinking, of, the, lusitania, in, response, bryan, who, believed, that, wilson, had, placed, the, defense, of, american, trade, rights, above, neutrality, resigned, from, the, cabinet, in, march, 1916, the, ss, sussex, an, unarmed, ferry, under, the, french, flag, was, torpedoed, in, the, english, channel, and, four, americans, were, counted, among, the, dead, wilson, extracted, from, germany, a, pledge, to, constrain, submarine, warfare, to, the, rules, of, cruiser, warfare, which, represented, a, major, diplomatic, concession, interventionists, led, by, theodore, roosevelt, wanted, war, with, germany, and, attacked, wilson, s, refusal, to, build, up, the, army, in, anticipation, of, war, after, the, sinking, of, the, lusitania, and, the, resignation, of, bryan, wilson, publicly, committed, himself, to, what, became, known, as, the, preparedness, movement, and, began, to, build, up, the, army, and, the, navy, in, june, 1916, congress, passed, the, national, defense, act, of, 1916, which, established, the, reserve, officers, training, corps, and, expanded, the, national, guard, later, in, the, year, congress, passed, the, naval, act, of, 1916, which, provided, for, a, major, expansion, of, the, navy, the, health, of, ellen, wilson, declined, after, her, husband, entered, office, and, doctors, diagnosed, her, with, bright, s, disease, in, july, 1914, she, died, on, august, 6, 1914, president, wilson, was, deeply, affected, by, the, loss, falling, into, depression, on, march, 18, 1915, wilson, met, edith, bolling, galt, at, a, white, house, tea, galt, was, a, widow, and, jeweler, who, was, also, from, the, south, after, several, meetings, wilson, fell, in, love, with, her, and, he, proposed, marriage, to, her, in, may, 1915, galt, initially, rebuffed, him, but, wilson, was, undeterred, and, continued, the, courtship, edith, gradually, warmed, to, the, relationship, and, they, became, engaged, in, september, 1915, they, were, married, on, december, 18, 1915, woodrow, wilson, joined, john, tyler, and, grover, cleveland, as, the, only, presidents, to, marry, while, in, office, wilson, was, renominated, at, the, 1916, democratic, national, convention, without, opposition, in, an, effort, to, win, progressive, voters, wilson, called, for, legislation, providing, for, an, eight, hour, day, and, six, day, workweek, health, and, safety, measures, the, prohibition, of, child, labor, and, safeguards, for, female, workers, he, also, favored, a, minimum, wage, for, all, work, performed, by, and, for, the, federal, government, the, democrats, also, campaigned, on, the, slogan, he, kept, us, out, of, war, and, warned, that, a, republican, victory, would, mean, war, with, germany, hoping, to, reunify, the, progressive, and, conservative, wings, of, the, party, the, 1916, republican, national, convention, nominated, supreme, court, justice, charles, evans, hughes, for, president, as, a, jurist, he, had, been, completely, out, of, politics, by, 1912, though, republicans, attacked, wilson, s, foreign, policy, on, various, grounds, domestic, affairs, generally, dominated, the, campaign, republicans, campaigned, against, wilson, s, new, freedom, policies, especially, tariff, reduction, the, new, income, taxes, and, the, adamson, act, which, they, derided, as, class, legislation, the, election, was, close, and, the, outcome, was, in, doubt, with, hughes, ahead, in, the, east, and, wilson, in, the, south, and, west, the, decision, came, down, to, california, on, november, 10, california, certified, that, wilson, had, won, the, state, by, 3, 806, votes, giving, him, a, majority, of, the, electoral, vote, nationally, wilson, won, 277, electoral, votes, and, 49, 2, percent, of, the, popular, vote, while, hughes, won, 254, electoral, votes, and, 46, 1, percent, of, the, popular, vote, wilson, was, able, to, win, by, picking, up, many, votes, that, had, gone, to, roosevelt, or, debs, in, 1912, he, swept, the, solid, south, and, won, all, but, a, handful, of, western, states, while, hughes, won, most, of, the, northeastern, and, midwestern, states, wilson, s, re, election, made, him, the, first, democrat, since, andrew, jackson, in, 1832, to, win, two, consecutive, terms, the, democrats, kept, control, of, congress, in, january, 1917, the, german, empire, initiated, a, new, policy, of, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, against, ships, in, the, seas, around, the, british, isles, german, leaders, knew, that, the, policy, would, likely, provoke, u, s, entrance, into, the, war, but, they, hoped, to, defeat, the, allied, powers, before, the, u, s, could, fully, mobilize, in, late, february, the, u, s, public, learned, of, the, zimmermann, telegram, a, secret, diplomatic, communication, in, which, germany, sought, to, convince, mexico, to, join, it, in, a, war, against, the, united, states, after, a, series, of, attacks, on, american, ships, wilson, held, a, cabinet, meeting, on, march, 20, all, cabinet, members, agreed, that, the, time, had, come, for, the, united, states, to, enter, the, war, the, cabinet, members, believed, that, germany, was, engaged, in, a, commercial, war, against, the, united, states, and, that, the, united, states, had, to, respond, with, a, formal, declaration, of, war, on, april, 2, 1917, wilson, addressed, the, u, s, congress, asking, for, a, declaration, of, war, against, germany, saying, that, germany, was, engaged, in, nothing, less, than, war, against,

increased, industrial, and, agricultural, production, he, stated, we, have, no, selfish, ends, to, serve, we, desire, no, conquest, no, dominion, no, material, compensation, for, the, sacrifices, we, shall, freely, make, we, are, but, one, of, the, champions, of, the, rights, of, mankind, we, shall, be, satisfied, when, those, rights, have, been, made, as, secure, as, the, faith, and, freedom, of, the, nations, can, make, them, the, declaration, of, war, by, the, united, states, against, germany, passed, congress, with, strong, bipartisan, majorities, on, april, 6, 1917, the, united, states,

some, resistance, to, conscription, and, to, the, commitment, of, american, soldiers, abroad, large, majorities, of, both, houses, of, congress, voted, to, impose, conscription, with, the, selective, service, act, of, 1917, seeking, to, avoid, the, draft, riots, of, the, civil, war, the, bill, established, local, draft, boards, that, were, charged, with, determining, who, should, be, drafted, by,

and, a, new, emphasis, on, the, convoy, system, wilson, sought, the, establishment, of, an, organized, common, peace, that, would, help, prevent, future, conflicts, in, this, goal, he, was, opposed, not, just, by, the, central, powers, but, also, the, other, allied, powers, who, to, various, degrees, sought, to, win, concessions, and, to, impose, a, punitive, peace, agreement, on, the, central, powers, on, january, 8, 1918, wilson, delivered, a, speech, known, as, the, fourteen, points, wherein, he, articulated, his, administration, s, long, term, war, objectives, wilson, called, for, the, establishment, of, an, association, of, nations, to, guarantee, the, independence, and, territorial, integrity, of, all, nations, a, league, of, nations, other, points, included, the, evacuation, of, occupied, territory, the, establishment, of, an, independent, poland, and, self, determination, for, the, peoples, of, austria, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, under, the, command, of, general, pershing, the, american, expeditionary, forces, first, arrived, in, france, in, mid, 1917, wilson, and, pershing, rejected, the, british, and, french, proposal, that, american, soldiers, integrate, into, existing, allied, units, giving, the, united, states, more, freedom, of, action, but, requiring, for, the, creation, of, new, organizations, and, supply, chains, russia, exited, the, war, after, signing, the, treaty, of, brest, litovsk, in, march, 1918, allowing, germany, to, shift, soldiers, from, the, eastern, front, of, the, war, hoping, to, break, allied, lines, before, american, soldiers, could, arrive, in, full, force, the, germans, launched, the, spring, offensive, on, the, western, front, both, sides, suffered, hundreds, of, thousands, of, casualties, as, the, germans, forced, back, the, british, and, french, but, germany, was, unable, to, capture, the, french, capital, of, paris, there, were, only, 175, 000, american, soldiers, in, europe, at, the, end, of, 1917, but, by, mid, 1918, 10, 000, americans, were, arriving, in, europe, per, day, with, american, forces, having, joined, in, the, fight, the, allies, defeated, germany, in, the, battle, of, belleau, wood, and, the, battle, of, ch, teau, thierry, beginning, in, august, the, allies, launched, the, hundred, days, offensive, pushing, back, the, exhausted, german, army, meanwhile, french, and, british, leaders, convinced, wilson, to, send, a, few, thousand, american, soldiers, to, join, the, allied, intervention, in, russia, which, was, in, the, midst, of, a, civil, war, between, the, communist, bolsheviks, and, the, white, movement, by, the, end, of, september, 1918, the, german, leadership, no, longer, believed, it, could, win, the, war, and, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, appointed, a, new, government, led, by, prince, maximilian, of, baden, baden, immediately, sought, an, armistice, with, wilson, with, the, fourteen, points, to, serve, as, the, basis, of, the, german, surrender, house, procured, agreement, to, the, armistice, from, france, and, britain, but, only, after, threatening, to, conclude, a, unilateral, armistice, without, them, germany, and, the, allied, powers, brought, an, end, to, the, fighting, with, the, signing, of, the, armistice, of, 11, november, 1918, austria, hungary, had, signed, the, armistice, of, villa, giusti, eight, days, earlier, while, the,

war, cabinet, met, weekly, with, wilson, because, he, was, heavily, focused, on, foreign, policy, during, world, war, i, wilson, delegated, a, large, degree, of, authority, over, the, home, front, to, his, subordinates, in, the, midst, of, the, war, the, federal, budget, soared, from, 1, billion, in, fiscal, year, 1916, to, 19, billion, in, fiscal, year, 1919, in, addition, to, spending, on, its, own, military, build, up, wall, street, in, 1914, 1916, and, the, treasury, in, 1917, 1918, provided, large, loans, to, the, allied, countries, thus, financing, the, war, effort, of, britain, and, france, seeking, to, avoid, the, high, levels, of, inflation, that, had, accompanied, the, heavy, borrowing, of, the, american, civil, war, the, wilson, administration, raised, taxes, during, the, war, the, war, revenue, act, of, 1917, and, the, revenue, act, of, 1918, raised, the, top, tax, rate, to, 77, percent, greatly, increased, the, number, of, americans, paying, the, income, tax, and, levied, an, excess, profits, tax, on, businesses, and, individuals, despite, these, tax, acts, the, united, states, was, forced, to, borrow, heavily, to, finance, the, war, effort, treasury, secretary, mcadoo, authorized, the, issuing, of, low, interest, war, bonds, and, to, attract, investors, made, interest, on, the, bonds, tax, free, the, bonds, proved, so, popular, among, investors, that, many, borrowed, money, in, order, to, buy, more, bonds, the, purchase, of, bonds, along, with, other, war, time, pressures, resulted, in, rising, inflation, though, this, inflation, was, partly, matched, by, rising, wages, and, profits, to, shape, public, opinion, wilson, in, 1917, established, the, first, modern, propaganda, office, the, committee, on, public, information, cpi, headed, by, george, creel, wilson, called, on, voters, in, the, 1918, off, year, elections, to, elect, democrats, as, an, endorsement, of, his, policies, however, the, republicans, won, over, alienated, german, americans, and, took, control, wilson, refused, to, coordinate, or, compromise, with, the, new, leaders, of, house, and, senate, senator, henry, cabot, lodge, became, his, nemesis, in, november, 1919, wilson, s, attorney, general, a, mitchell, palmer, began, to, target, anarchists, industrial, workers, of, the, world, members, and, other, antiwar, groups, in, what, became, known, as, the, palmer, raids, thousands, were, arrested, for, incitement, to, violence, espionage, or, sedition, wilson, by, that, point, was, incapacitated, and, was, not, told, what, was, happening, after, the, signing, of, the, armistice, wilson, traveled, to, europe, to, lead, the, american, delegation, to, the, paris, peace, conference, thereby, becoming, the, first, incumbent, president, to, travel, to, europe, although, republicans, now, controlled, congress, wilson, shut, them, out, senate, republicans, and, even, some, senate, democrats, complained, about, their, lack, of, representation, in, the, delegation, it, consisted, of, wilson, colonel, house, secretary, of, state, robert, lansing, general, tasker, h, bliss, and, diplomat, henry, white, who, was, the, only, republican, and, he, was, not, an, active, partisan, save, for, a, two, week, return, to, the, united, states, wilson, remained, in, europe, for, six, months, where, he, focused, on, reaching, a, peace, treaty, to, formally, end, the, war, wilson, british, prime, minister, david, lloyd, george, french, prime, minister, georges, clemenceau, and, italian, prime, minister, vittorio, emanuele, orlando, made, up, the, big, four, the, allied, leaders, with, the, most, influence, at, the, paris, peace, conference, wilson, had, an, illness, during, the, conference, and, some, experts, believe, the, spanish, flu, was, the, cause, unlike, other, allied, leaders, wilson, did, not, seek, territorial, gains, or, material, concessions, from, the, central, powers, his, chief, goal, was, the, establishment, of, the, league, of, nations, which, he, saw, as, the, keystone, of, the, whole, programme, wilson, himself, presided, over, the, committee, that, drafted, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, the, covenant, bound, members, to, respect, freedom, of, religion, treat, racial, minorities, fairly, and, peacefully, settle, disputes, through, organizations, like, the, permanent, court, of, international, justice, article, x, of, the, league, covenant, required, all, nations, to, defend, league, members, against, external, aggression, japan, proposed, that, the, conference, endorse, a, racial, equality, proposal, wilson, was, indifferent, to, the, issue, but, acceded, to, strong, opposition, from, britain, s, dominions, such, as, australia, and, south, africa, the, covenant, of, the, league, of, nations, was, incorporated, into, the, conference, s, treaty, of, versailles, which, ended, the, war, with, germany, and, into, other, peace, treaties, aside, from, the, establishment, the, league, of, nations, and, solidifying, a, lasting, world, peace, wilson, s, other, main, goal, at, the, paris, peace, conference, was, that, self, determination, be, the, primary, basis, used, for, drawing, new, international, borders, however, in, pursuit, of, his, league, of, nations, wilson, conceded, several, points, to, the, other, powers, present, at, the, conference, germany, was, required, to, permanently, cede, territory, pay, war, reparations, relinquish, all, of, her, overseas, colonies, and, dependencies, and, submit, to, military, occupation, in, the, rhineland, additionally, a, clause, in, the, treaty, specifically, named, germany, as, responsible, for, the, war, wilson, agreed, to, allowing, the, allied, european, powers, and, japan, to, essentially, expand, their, empires, by, establishing, de, facto, colonies, in, the, middle, east, africa, and, asia, out, the, former, german, and, ottoman, empires, these, territorial, awards, to, the, victorious, countries, were, thinly, disguised, as, league, of, nations, mandates, the, japanese, acquisition, of, german, interests, in, the, shandong, peninsula, of, china, proved, especially, unpopular, as, it, undercut, wilson, s, promise, of, self, government, wilson, s, hopes, for, achieving, self, determination, saw, some, success, when, the, conference, recognized, multiple, new, and, independent, states, created, in, eastern, europe, including, albania, czechoslovakia, poland, and, yugoslavia, the, conference, finished, negotiations, in, may, 1919, at, which, point, the, new, leaders, of, republican, germany, viewed, the, treaty, for, the, first, time, some, german, leaders, favored, repudiating, the, peace, due, to, the, harshness, of, the, terms, though, ultimately, germany, signed, the, treaty, on, june, 28, 1919, wilson, was, unable, to, convince, the, other, allied, powers, france, in, particular, to, temper, the, harshness, of, the, settlement, being, leveled, at, the, defeated, central, powers, especially, germany, for, his, efforts, towards, creating, a, lasting, world, peace, wilson, was, awarded, the, 1919, nobel, peace, prize, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, required, the, support, of, two, thirds, of, the, senate, a, difficult, proposition, given, that, republicans, held, a, narrow, majority, in, the, senate, after, the, 1918, u, s, elections, republicans, were, outraged, by, wilson, s, failure, to, discuss, the, war, or, its, aftermath, with, them, and, an, intensely, partisan, battle, developed, in, the, senate, republican, senator, henry, cabot, lodge, supported, a, version, of, the, treaty, that, required, wilson, to, compromise, wilson, refused, some, republicans, including, former, president, taft, and, former, secretary, of, state, elihu, root, favored, ratification, of, the, treaty, with, some, modifications, and, their, public, support, gave, wilson, some, chance, of, winning, the, treaty, s, ratification, the, debate, over, the, treaty, centered, around, a, debate, over, the, american, role, in, the, world, community, in, the, post, war, era, and, senators, fell, into, three, main, groups, the, first, group, consisting, of, most, democrats, favored, the, treaty, fourteen, senators, mostly, republicans, were, known, as, the, irreconcilables, as, they, completely, opposed, u, s, entrance, into, the, league, of, nations, some, of, these, irreconcilables, opposed, the, treaty, for, its, failure, to, emphasize, decolonization, and, disarmament, while, others, feared, surrendering, american, freedom, of, action, to, an, international, organization, the, remaining, group, of, senators, known, as, reservationists, accepted, the, idea, of, the, league, but, sought, varying, degrees, of, change, to, ensure, the, protection, of, american, sovereignty, and, the, right, of, congress, to, decide, on, going, to, war, article, x, of, the, league, covenant, which, sought, to, create, a, system, of, collective, security, by, requiring, league, members, to, protect, one, another, against, external, aggression, seemed, to, force, the, u, s, to, join, in, any, war, the, league, decided, upon, wilson, consistently, refused, to, compromise, partly, due, to, concerns, about, having, to, re, open, negotiations, with, the, other, treaty, signatories, when, lodge, was, on, the, verge, of, building, a, two, thirds, majority, to, ratify, the, treaty, with, ten, reservations, wilson, forced, his, supporters, to, vote, nay, on, march, 19, 1920, thereby, closing, the, issue, cooper, says, that, nearly, every, league, advocate, went, along, with, lodge, but, their, efforts, failed, solely, because, wilson, admittedly, rejected, all, reservations, proposed, in, the, senate, thomas, a, bailey, calls, wilson, s, action, the, supreme, act, of, infanticide, he, adds, the, treaty, was, slain, in, the, house, of, its, friends, rather, than, in, the, house, of, its, enemies, in, the, final, analysis, it, was, not, the, two, thirds, rule, or, the, irreconcilables, or, lodge, or, the, strong, and, mild, reservationists, but, wilson, and, his, docile, following, who, delivered, the, fatal, stab, to, bolster, public, support, for, ratification, wilson, barnstormed, the, western, states, but, he, returned, to, the, white, house, in, late, september, due, to, health, problems, on, october, 2, 1919, wilson, suffered, a, serious, stroke, leaving, him, paralyzed, on, his, left, side, and, with, only, partial, vision, in, the, right, eye, he, was, confined, to, bed, for, weeks, and, sequestered, from, everyone, except, his, wife, and, his, physician, cary, grayson, bert, e, park, a, neurosurgeon, who, examined, wilson, s, medical, records, after, his, death, writes, that, wilson, s, illness, affected, his, personality, in, various, ways, making, him, prone, to, disorders, of, emotion, impaired, impulse, control, and, defective, judgment, anxious, to, help, the, president, recover, tumulty, grayson, and, the, first, lady, determined, what, documents, the, president, read, and, who, was, allowed, to, communicate, with, him, for, her, influence, in, the, administration, some, have, described, edith, wilson, as, the, first, female, president, of, the, united, states, link, states, that, by, november, 1919, wilson, s, recovery, was, only, partial, at, best, his, mind, remained, relatively, clear, but, he, was, physically, enfeebled, and, the, disease, had, wrecked, his, emotional, constitution, and, aggravated, all, his, more, unfortunate, personal, traits, throughout, late, 1919, wilson, s, inner, circle, concealed, the, severity, of, his, health, issues, by, february, 1920, the, president, s, true, condition, was, publicly, known, many, expressed, qualms, about, wilson, s, fitness, for, the, presidency, at, a, time, when, the, league, fight, was, reaching, a, climax, and, domestic, issues, such, as, strikes, unemployment, inflation, and, the, threat, of, communism, were, ablaze, in, mid, march, 1920, lodge, and, his, republicans, formed, a, coalition, with, the, pro, treaty, democrats, to, pass, a, treaty, with, reservations, but, wilson, rejected, this, compromise, and, enough, democrats, followed, his, lead, to, defeat, ratification, no, one, close, to, wilson, was, willing, to, certify, as, required, by, the, constitution, his, inability, to, discharge, the, powers, and, duties, of, the, said, office, though, some, members, of, congress, encouraged, vice, president, marshall, to, assert, his, claim, to, the, presidency, marshall, never, attempted, to, replace, wilson, wilson, s, lengthy, period, of, incapacity, while, serving, as, president, was, nearly, unprecedented, of, the, previous, presidents, only, james, garfield, had, been, in, a, similar, situation, but, garfield, retained, greater, control, of, his, mental, faculties, and, faced, relatively, few, pressing, issues, when, the, war, ended, the, wilson, administration, dismantled, the, wartime, boards, and, regulatory, agencies, demobilization, was, chaotic, and, at, times, violent, four, million, soldiers, were, sent, home, with, little, money, and, few, benefits, in, 1919, strikes, in, major, industries, broke, out, disrupting, the, economy, the, country, experienced, further, turbulence, as, a, series, of, race, riots, broke, out, in, the, summer, of, 1919, in, 1920, the, economy, plunged, into, a, severe, economic, depression, unemployment, rose, to, 12, percent, and, the, price, of, agricultural, products, sharply, declined, following, the, bolshevik, revolution, in, russia, and, similar, revolutionary, attempts, in, germany, and, hungary, many, americans, feared, the, possibility, of, terrorism, in, the, united, states, such, concerns, were, inflamed, by, the, bombings, in, april, 1919, when, anarchists, mailed, 38, bombs, to, prominent, americans, one, person, was, killed, but, most, packages, were, intercepted, nine, more, mail, bombs, were, sent, in, june, injuring, several, people, fresh, fears, combined, with, a, patriotic, national, mood, sparking, the, first, red, scare, in, 1919, attorney, general, palmer, from, november, 1919, to, january, 1920, launched, the, palmer, raids, to, suppress, radical, organizations, over, 10, 000, people, were, arrested, and, 556, aliens, were, deported, including, emma, goldman, palmer, s, activities, met, resistance, from, the, courts, and, some, senior, administration, officials, no, one, told, wilson, what, palmer, was, doing, later, in, 1920, the, wall, street, bombing, on, september, 16, killed, 40, and, injured, hundreds, in, the, deadliest, terrorist, attack, on, american, soil, up, to, that, point, anarchists, took, credit, and, promised, more, violence, they, escaped, capture, prohibition, developed, as, an, unstoppable, reform, during, world, war, i, but, the, wilson, administration, played, only, a, minor, role, the, eighteenth, amendment, passed, congress, and, was, ratified, by, the, states, in, 1919, in, october, 1919, wilson, vetoed, the, volstead, act, legislation, designed, to, enforce, prohibition, but, his, veto, was, overridden, by, congress, wilson, opposed, women, s, suffrage, in, 1911, because, he, believed, women, lacked, the, public, experience, needed, to, be, good, voters, the, actual, evidence, of, how, women, voters, behaved, in, the, western, states, changed, his, mind, and, he, came, to, feel, they, could, indeed, be, good, voters, he, did, not, speak, publicly, on, the, issue, except, to, echo, the, democratic, party, position, that, suffrage, was, a, state, matter, primarily, because, of, strong, opposition, in, the, white, south, to, black, voting, rights, in, a, 1918, speech, before, congress, wilson, for, the, first, time, backed, a, national, right, to, vote, we, have, made, partners, of, the, women, in, this, war, shall, we, admit, them, only, to, a, partnership, of, suffering, and, sacrifice, and, toil, and, not, to, a, partnership, of, privilege, and, right, the, house, passed, a, constitutional, amendment, providing, for, women, s, suffrage, nationwide, but, this, stalled, in, the, senate, wilson, continually, pressured, the, senate, to, vote, for, the, amendment, telling, senators, that, its, ratification, was, vital, to, winning, the, war, the, senate, finally, approved, it, in, june, 1919, and, the, requisite, number, of, states, ratified, the, nineteenth, amendment, in, august, 1920, despite, his, medical, incapacity, wilson, wanted, to, run, for, a, third, term, while, the, 1920, democratic, national, convention, strongly, endorsed, wilson, s, policies, democratic, leaders, refused, nominating, instead, a, ticket, consisting, of, governor, james, m, cox, and, assistant, secretary, of, the, navy, franklin, d, roosevelt, the, republicans, centered, their, campaign, around, opposition, to, wilson, s, policies, with, senator, warren, g, harding, promising, a, return, to, normalcy, wilson, largely, stayed, out, of, the, campaign, although, he, endorsed, cox, and, continued, to, advocate, for, u, s, membership, in, the, league, of, nations, harding, won, the, election, in, a, landslide, capturing, over, 60, of, the, popular, vote, and, winning, every, state, outside, of, the, south, wilson, met, with, harding, for, tea, on, his, last, day, in, office, march, 3, 1921, due, to, his, health, wilson, was, unable, to, attend, the, inauguration, on, december, 10, 1920, wilson, was, awarded, the, 1919, nobel, peace, prize, for, his, role, as, founder, of, the, league, of, nations, wilson, became, the, second, sitting, united, states, president, after, theodore, roosevelt, to, become, a, nobel, peace, laureate, after, the, end, of, his, second, term, in, 1921, wilson, and, his, wife, moved, from, the, white, house, to, a, townhouse, in, the, kalorama, section, of, washington, d, c, he, continued, to, follow, politics, as, president, harding, and, the, republican, congress, repudiated, membership, in, the, league, of, nations, cut, taxes, and, raised, tariffs, in, 1921, wilson, opened, a, law, practice, with, former, secretary, of, state, bainbridge, colby, wilson, showed, up, the, first, day, but, never, returned, and, the, practice, was, closed, by, the, end, of, 1922, wilson, tried, writing, and, he, produced, a, few, short, essays, after, enormous, effort, they, marked, a, sad, finish, to, a, formerly, great, literary, career, he, declined, to, write, memoirs, but, frequently, met, with, ray, stannard, baker, who, wrote, a, three, volume, biography, of, wilson, that, was, published, in, 1922, in, august, 1923, wilson, attended, the, funeral, of, his, successor, warren, harding, on, november, 10, 1923, wilson, made, his, last, national, address, delivering, a, short, armistice, day, radio, speech, from, the, library, of, his, home, wilson, s, health, did, not, markedly, improve, after, leaving, office, declining, rapidly, in, january, 1924, he, died, on, february, 3, 1924, at, the, age, of, 67, the,

nation, s, capital, wilson, was, born, and, raised, in, the, u, s, south, by, parents, who, were, committed, supporters, of, both, slavery, and, the, confederacy, academically, wilson, was, an, apologist, for, slavery, and, the, redeemers, and, one, of, the, foremost, promoters, of, the, lost, cause, mythology, wilson, was, the, first, southerner, elected, president, since, zachary, taylor, in, 1848, and, the, only, former, subject, of, the, confederacy, wilson, s, election, was, celebrated, by, southern, segregationists, at, princeton, wilson, actively, dissuaded, the, admission, of, african, americans, as, students, several, historians, have, spotlighted, consistent, examples, in, the, public, record, of, wilson, s, overtly, racist, policies, and, the, inclusion, of, segregationists, in, his, cabinet, other, sources, say, wilson, defended, segregation, as, a, rational, scientific, policy, in, private, and, describe, him, as, a, man, who, loved, to, tell, racist, darky, jokes, about, black, americans, during, wilson, s, presidency, d, w, griffith, s, pro, ku, klux, klan, film, the, birth, of, a, nation, 1915, was, the, first, motion, picture, to, be, screened, in, the, white, house, though, he, was, not, initially, critical, of, the, movie, wilson, distanced, himself, from, it, as, public, backlash, mounted, and, eventually, released, a, statement, condemning, the, film, s, message, while, denying, he, had, been, aware, of, it, prior, to, the, screening, by, the, 1910s, african, americans, had, become, effectively, shut, out, of, elected, office, obtaining, an, executive, appointment, to, a, position, within, the, federal, bureaucracy, was, usually, the, only, option, for, african, american, statesmen, according, to, berg, wilson, continued, to, appoint, african, americans, to, positions, that, had, traditionally, been, filled, by, black, people, overcoming, opposition, from, many, southern, senators, oswald, garrison, villard, who, later, became, an, opponent, of, his, initially, thought, that, wilson, was, not, a, bigot, and, supported, progress, for, black, people, and, he, was, frustrated, by, southern, opposition, in, the, senate, to, which, wilson, capitulated, in, a, conversation, with, wilson, journalist, john, palmer, gavit, came, to, the, realization, that, opposition, to, those, views, would, certainly, precipitate, a, conflict, which, would, put, a, complete, stop, to, any, legislative, program, since, the, end, of, reconstruction, both, parties, recognized, certain, appointments, as, unofficially, reserved, for, qualified, african, americans, wilson, appointed, a, total, of, nine, african, americans, to, prominent, positions, in, the, federal, bureaucracy, eight, of, whom, were, republican, carry, overs, for, comparison, william, howard, taft, was, met, with, disdain, and, outrage, from, republicans, of, both, races, for, appointing, thirty, one, black, officeholders, a, record, low, for, a, republican, president, upon, taking, office, wilson, fired, all, but, two, of, the, seventeen, black, supervisors, in, the, federal, bureaucracy, appointed, by, taft, since, 1863, the, u, s, mission, to, haiti, and, santo, domingo, was, almost, always, led, by, an, african, american, diplomat, regardless, of, what, party, the, sitting, president, belonged, to, wilson, ended, this, half, century, old, tradition, but, continued, to, appoint, black, diplomats, like, george, washington, buckner, as, well, as, joseph, l, johnson, to, head, the, mission, to, liberia, since, the, end, of, reconstruction, the, federal, bureaucracy, had, been, possibly, the, only, career, path, where, african, americans, could, experience, some, measure, of, equality, and, was, the, life, blood, and, foundation, of, the, black, middle, class, wilson, s, administration, escalated, the, discriminatory, hiring, policies, and, segregation, of, government, offices, that, had, begun, under, theodore, roosevelt, and, continued, under, taft, in, wilson, s, first, month, in, office, postmaster, general, albert, s, burleson, urged, the, president, to, establish, segregated, government, offices, wilson, did, not, adopt, burleson, s, proposal, but, allowed, cabinet, secretaries, discretion, to, segregate, their, respective, departments, by, the, end, of, 1913, many, departments, including, the, navy, treasury, and, post, office, had, segregated, work, spaces, restrooms, and, cafeterias, many, agencies, used, segregation, as, a, pretext, to, adopt, a, whites, only, employment, policy, claiming, they, lacked, facilities, for, black, workers, in, these, instances, african, americans, employed, prior, to, the, wilson, administration, were, either, offered, early, retirement, transferred, or, simply, fired, wilson, did, at, the, suggest, of, oklahoma, senator, thomas, gore, nominate, a, black, democrat, from, muskogee, oklahoma, adam, e, patterson, for, the, position, of, register, of, the, treasury, in, july, 1913, but, patterson, withdrew, his, name, from, consideration, following, opposition, from, southern, democratic, senators, james, k, vardaman, and, benjamin, tillman, wilson, proceeded, to, nominate, gabe, e, parker, who, was, of, mixed, european, and, choctaw, descent, for, the, position, instead, and, did, not, nominate, any, other, black, people, for, federal, office, afterwards, racial, discrimination, in, federal, hiring, increased, further, when, after, 1914, the, united, states, civil, service, commission, instituted, a, new, policy, requiring, job, applicants, to, submit, a, personal, photo, with, their, application, as, a, federal, enclave, washington, d, c, had, long, offered, african, americans, greater, opportunities, for, employment, and, less, glaring, discrimination, in, 1919, black, veterans, returning, home, to, d, c, were, shocked, to, discover, jim, crow, laws, had, set, in, many, could, not, go, back, to, the, jobs, they, held, prior, to, the, war, or, even, enter, the, same, building, they, used, to, work, in, due, to, the, color, of, their, skin, booker, t, washington, described, the, situation, i, had, never, seen, the, colored, people, so, discouraged, and, bitter, as, they, are, at, the, present, time, while, segregation, had, been, present, in, the, army, prior, to, wilson, its, severity, increased, significantly, under, his, election, during, wilson, s, first, term, the, army, and, navy, refused, to, commission, new, black, officers, black, officers, already, serving, experienced, increased, discrimination, and, were, often, forced, out, or, discharged, on, dubious, grounds, following, the, entry, of, the, u, s, into, world, war, i, the, war, department, drafted, hundreds, of, thousands, of, black, people, into, the, army, and, draftees, were, paid, equally, regardless, of, race, commissioning, of, african, americans, officers, resumed, but, units, remained, segregated, and, most, all, black, units, were, led, by, white, officers, unlike, the, army, the, u, s, navy, was, never, formally, segregated, following, wilson, s, appointment, of, josephus, daniels, as, secretary, of, the, navy, a, system, of, jim, crow, was, swiftly, implemented, with, ships, training, facilities, restrooms, and, cafeterias, all, becoming, segregated, while, daniels, significantly, expanded, opportunities, for, advancement, and, training, available, to, white, sailors, by, the, time, the, u, s, entered, world, war, i, african, american, sailors, had, been, relegated, almost, entirely, to, mess, and, custodial, duties, often, assigned, to, act, as, servants, for, white, officers, in, response, to, the, demand, for, industrial, labor, the, great, migration, of, african, americans, out, of, the, south, surged, in, 1917, and, 1918, this, migration, sparked, race, riots, including, the, east, st, louis, riots, of, 1917, in, response, to, these, riots, but, only, after, much, public, outcry, wilson, asked, attorney, general, thomas, watt, gregory, if, the, federal, government, could, intervene, to, check, these, disgraceful, outrages, on, the, advice, of, gregory, wilson, did, not, take, direct, action, against, the, riots, in, 1918, wilson, spoke, out, against, lynching, in, the, united, states, stating, i, say, plainly, that, every, american, who, takes, part, in, the, action, of, mob, or, gives, it, any, sort, of, continence, is, no, true, son, of, this, great, democracy, but, its, betrayer, and, her, by, that, single, disloyalty, to, her, standards, of, law, and, of, rights, in, 1919, another, series, of, race, riots, occurred, in, chicago, omaha, and, two, dozen, other, major, cities, in, the, north, the, federal, government, did, not, become, involved, just, as, it, had, not, become, involved, previously, wilson, is, generally, ranked, by, historians, and, political, scientists, as, an, above, average, president, in, the, view, of, some, historians, wilson, more, than, any, of, his, predecessors, took, steps, towards, the, creation, of, a, strong, federal, government, that, would, protect, ordinary, citizens, against, the, overwhelming, power, of, large, corporations, he, is, generally, regarded, as, a, key, figure, in, the, establishment, of, modern, american, liberalism, and, a, strong, influence, on, future, presidents, such, as, franklin, d, roosevelt, and, lyndon, b, johnson, cooper, argues, that, in, terms, of, impact, and, ambition, only, the, new, deal, and, the, great, society, rival, the, domestic, accomplishments, of, wilson, s, presidency, many, of, wilson, s, accomplishments, including, the, federal, reserve, the, federal, trade, commission, the, graduated, income, tax, and, labor, laws, continued, to, influence, the, united, states, long, after, wilson, s, death, many, conservatives, have, attacked, wilson, for, his, role, in, expanding, the, federal, government, in, 2018, conservative, columnist, george, will, wrote, in, the, washington, post, that, theodore, roosevelt, and, wilson, were, the, progenitors, of, today, s, imperial, presidency, wilson, s, idealistic, foreign, policy, which, came, to, be, known, as, wilsonianism, also, cast, a, long, shadow, over, american, foreign, policy, and, wilson, s, league, of, nations, influenced, the, development, of, the, united, nations, saladin, ambar, writes, that, wilson, was, the, first, statesman, of, world, stature, to, speak, out, not, only, against, european, imperialism, but, against, the, newer, form, of, economic, domination, sometimes, described, as, informal, imperialism, notwithstanding, his, accomplishments, in, office, wilson, has, received, criticism, for, his, record, on, race, relations, and, civil, liberties, for, his, interventions, in, latin, america, and, for, his, failure, to, win, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, despite, his, southern, roots, and, record, at, princeton, wilson, became, the, first, democrat, to, receive, widespread, support, from, the, african, american, community, in, a, presidential, election, wilson, s, african, american, supporters, many, of, whom, had, crossed, party, lines, to, vote, for, him, in, 1912, found, themselves, bitterly, disappointed, by, the, wilson, presidency, his, decision, to, allow, the, imposition, of, jim, crow, within, the, federal, bureaucracy, in, particular, ross, kennedy, writes, that, wilson, s, support, of, segregation, complied, with, predominant, public, opinion, a, scott, berg, argues, wilson, accepted, segregation, as, part, of, a, policy, to, promote, racial, progress, by, shocking, the, social, system, as, little, as, possible, the, ultimate, result, of, this, policy, was, unprecedented, levels, of, segregation, within, the, federal, bureaucracy, and, far, fewer, opportunities, for, employment, and, promotion, being, open, to, african, americans, than, before, historian, kendrick, clements, argues, wilson, had, none, of, the, crude, vicious, racism, of, james, k, vardaman, or, benjamin, r, tillman, but, he, was, insensitive, to, african, american, feelings, and, aspirations, a, 2021, study, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, economics, found, that, wilson, s, segregation, of, the, civil, service, increased, the, black, white, earnings, gap, by, 3, 4, 6, 9, percentage, points, as, existing, black, civil, servants, were, driven, to, lower, paid, positions, black, civil, servants, who, were, exposed, to, wilson, s, segregationist, policies, experienced, a, relative, decline, in, home, ownership, rates, with, suggestive, evidence, of, lasting, adverse, effects, for, the, descendants, of, those, black, civil, servants, in, the, wake, of, the, charleston, church, shooting, some, individuals,
