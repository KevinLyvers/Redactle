johannes, kepler, k, p, l, r, german, 27, december, 1571, 15, november, 1630, was, a, german, astronomer, mathematician, astrologer, natural, philosopher, and, writer, on, music, he, is, a, key, figure, in, the, 17th, century, scientific, revolution, best, known, for, his, laws, of, planetary, motion, and, his, books, astronomia, nova, harmonice, mundi, and, epitome, astronomiae, copernicanae, influencing, among, others, isaac, newton, providing, one, of, the, foundations, for, his, theory, of, universal, gravitation, the, variety, and, impact, of, his, work, made, kepler, one, of, the, founders, and, fathers, of, modern, astronomy, the, scientific, method, natural, and, modern, science, he, has, been, described, as, the, father, of, science, fiction, for, his, novel, somnium, kepler, was, a, mathematics, teacher, at, a, seminary, school, in, graz, where, he, became, an, associate, of, prince, hans, ulrich, von, eggenberg, later, he, became, an, assistant, to, the, astronomer, tycho, brahe, in, prague, and, eventually, the, imperial, mathematician, to, emperor, rudolf, ii, and, his, two, successors, matthias, and, ferdinand, ii, he, also, taught, mathematics, in, linz, and, was, an, adviser, to, general, wallenstein, additionally, he, did, fundamental, work, in, the, field, of, optics, being, named, the, father, of, modern, optics, in, particular, for, his, astronomiae, pars, optica, he, also, invented, an, improved, version, of, the, refracting, telescope, the, keplerian, telescope, which, became, the, foundation, of, the, modern, refracting, telescope, while, also, improving, on, the, telescope, design, by, galileo, galilei, who, mentioned, kepler, s, discoveries, in, his, work, kepler, lived, in, an, era, when, there, was, no, clear, distinction, between, astronomy, and, astrology, but, there, was, a, strong, division, between, astronomy, a, branch, of, mathematics, within, the, liberal, arts, and, physics, a, branch, of, natural, philosophy, kepler, also, incorporated, religious, arguments, and, reasoning, into, his, work, motivated, by, the, religious, conviction, and, belief, that, god, had, created, the, world, according, to, an, intelligible, plan, that, is, accessible, through, the, natural, light, of, reason, kepler, described, his, new, astronomy, as, celestial, physics, as, an, excursion, into, aristotle, s, metaphysics, and, as, a, supplement, to, aristotle, s, on, the, heavens, transforming, the, ancient, tradition, of, physical, cosmology, by, treating, astronomy, as, part, of, a, universal, mathematical, physics, kepler, was, born, on, 27, december, 1571, in, the, free, imperial, city, of, weil, der, stadt, now, part, of, the, stuttgart, region, in, the, german, state, of, baden, w, rttemberg, his, grandfather, sebald, kepler, had, been, lord, mayor, of, the, city, by, the, time, johannes, was, born, the, kepler, family, fortune, was, in, decline, his, father, heinrich, kepler, earned, a, precarious, living, as, a, mercenary, and, he, left, the, family, when, johannes, was, five, years, old, he, was, believed, to, have, died, in, the, eighty, years, war, in, the, netherlands, his, mother, katharina, guldenmann, an, innkeeper, s, daughter, was, a, healer, and, herbalist, johannes, had, six, siblings, of, which, two, brothers, and, one, sister, survived, to, adulthood, born, prematurely, he, claimed, to, have, been, weak, and, sickly, as, a, child, nevertheless, he, often, impressed, travelers, at, his, grandfather, s, inn, with, his, phenomenal, mathematical, faculty, he, was, introduced, to, astronomy, at, an, early, age, and, developed, a, strong, passion, for, it, that, would, span, his, entire, life, at, age, six, he, observed, the, great, comet, of, 1577, writing, that, he, was, taken, by, mother, to, a, high, place, to, look, at, it, in, 1580, at, age, nine, he, observed, another, astronomical, event, a, lunar, eclipse, recording, that, he, remembered, being, called, outdoors, to, see, it, and, that, the, moon, appeared, quite, red, however, childhood, smallpox, left, him, with, weak, vision, and, crippled, hands, limiting, his, ability, in, the, observational, aspects, of, astronomy, in, 1589, after, moving, through, grammar, school, latin, school, and, seminary, at, maulbronn, kepler, attended, t, binger, stift, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, there, he, studied, philosophy, under, vitus, m, ller, and, theology, under, jacob, heerbrand, a, student, of, philipp, melanchthon, at, wittenberg, who, also, taught, michael, maestlin, while, he, was, a, student, until, he, became, chancellor, at, t, bingen, in, 1590, he, proved, himself, to, be, a, superb, mathematician, and, earned, a, reputation, as, a, skillful, astrologer, casting, horoscopes, for, fellow, students, under, the, instruction, of, michael, maestlin, t, bingen, s, professor, of, mathematics, from, 1583, to, 1631, he, learned, both, the, ptolemaic, system, and, the, copernican, system, of, planetary, motion, he, became, a, copernican, at, that, time, in, a, student, disputation, he, defended, heliocentrism, from, both, a, theoretical, and, theological, perspective, maintaining, that, the, sun, was, the, principal, source, of, motive, power, in, the, universe, despite, his, desire, to, become, a, minister, in, the, lutheran, church, he, was, denied, ordination, because, of, beliefs, contrary, to, the, formula, of, concord, near, the, end, of, his, studies, kepler, was, recommended, for, a, position, as, teacher, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, at, the, protestant, school, in, graz, he, accepted, the, position, in, april, 1594, at, the, age, of, 22, before, concluding, his, studies, at, t, bingen, kepler, accepted, an, offer, to, teach, mathematics, as, a, replacement, to, georg, stadius, at, the, protestant, school, in, graz, now, in, styria, austria, during, this, period, 1594, 1600, he, issued, many, official, calendars, and, prognostications, that, enhanced, his, reputation, as, an, astrologer, although, kepler, had, mixed, feelings, about, astrology, and, disparaged, many, customary, practices, of, astrologers, he, believed, deeply, in, a, connection, between, the, cosmos, and, the, individual, he, eventually, published, some, of, the, ideas, he, had, entertained, while, a, student, in, the, mysterium, cosmographicum, 1596, published, a, little, over, a, year, after, his, arrival, at, graz, in, december, 1595, kepler, was, introduced, to, barbara, m, ller, a, 23, year, old, widow, twice, over, with, a, young, daughter, regina, lorenz, and, he, began, courting, her, m, ller, an, heiress, to, the, estates, of, her, late, husbands, was, also, the, daughter, of, a, successful, mill, owner, her, father, jobst, initially, opposed, a, marriage, even, though, kepler, had, inherited, his, grandfather, s, nobility, kepler, s, poverty, made, him, an, unacceptable, match, jobst, relented, after, kepler, completed, work, on, mysterium, but, the, engagement, nearly, fell, apart, while, kepler, was, away, tending, to, the, details, of, publication, however, protestant, officials, who, had, helped, set, up, the, match, pressured, the, m, llers, to, honor, their, agreement, barbara, and, johannes, were, married, on, 27, april, 1597, in, the, first, years, of, their, marriage, the, keplers, had, two, children, heinrich, and, susanna, both, of, whom, died, in, infancy, in, 1602, they, had, a, daughter, susanna, in, 1604, a, son, friedrich, and, in, 1607, another, son, ludwig, following, the, publication, of, mysterium, and, with, the, blessing, of, the, graz, school, inspectors, kepler, began, an, ambitious, program, to, extend, and, elaborate, his, work, he, planned, four, additional, books, one, on, the, stationary, aspects, of, the, universe, the, sun, and, the, fixed, stars, one, on, the, planets, and, their, motions, one, on, the, physical, nature, of, planets, and, the, formation, of, geographical, features, focused, especially, on, earth, and, one, on, the, effects, of, the, heavens, on, the, earth, to, include, atmospheric, optics, meteorology, and, astrology, he, also, sought, the, opinions, of, many, of, the, astronomers, to, whom, he, had, sent, mysterium, among, them, reimarus, ursus, nicolaus, reimers, b, r, the, imperial, mathematician, to, rudolf, ii, and, a, bitter, rival, of, tycho, brahe, ursus, did, not, reply, directly, but, republished, kepler, s, flattering, letter, to, pursue, his, priority, dispute, over, what, is, now, called, the, tychonic, system, with, tycho, despite, this, black, mark, tycho, also, began, corresponding, with, kepler, starting, with, a, harsh, but, legitimate, critique, of, kepler, s, system, among, a, host, of, objections, tycho, took, issue, with, the, use, of, inaccurate, numerical, data, taken, from, copernicus, through, their, letters, tycho, and, kepler, discussed, a, broad, range, of, astronomical, problems, dwelling, on, lunar, phenomena, and, copernican, theory, particularly, its, theological, viability, but, without, the, significantly, more, accurate, data, of, tycho, s, observatory, kepler, had, no, way, to, address, many, of, these, issues, instead, he, turned, his, attention, to, chronology, and, harmony, the, numerological, relationships, among, music, mathematics, and, the, physical, world, and, their, astrological, consequences, by, assuming, the, earth, to, possess, a, soul, a, property, he, would, later, invoke, to, explain, how, the, sun, causes, the, motion, of, planets, he, established, a, speculative, system, connecting, astrological, aspects, and, astronomical, distances, to, weather, and, other, earthly, phenomena, by, 1599, however, he, again, felt, his, work, limited, by, the, inaccuracy, of, available, data, just, as, growing, religious, tension, was, also, threatening, his, continued, employment, in, graz, in, december, of, that, year, tycho, invited, kepler, to, visit, him, in, prague, on, 1, january, 1600, before, he, even, received, the, invitation, kepler, set, off, in, the, hopes, that, tycho, s, patronage, could, solve, his, philosophical, problems, as, well, as, his, social, and, financial, ones, on, 4, february, 1600, kepler, met, tycho, brahe, and, his, assistants, franz, tengnagel, and, longomontanus, at, ben, tky, nad, jizerou, 35, km, from, prague, the, site, where, tycho, s, new, observatory, was, being, constructed, over, the, next, two, months, he, stayed, as, a, guest, analyzing, some, of, tycho, s, observations, of, mars, tycho, guarded, his, data, closely, but, was, impressed, by, kepler, s, theoretical, ideas, and, soon, allowed, him, more, access, kepler, planned, to, test, his, theory, from, mysterium, cosmographicum, based, on, the, mars, data, but, he, estimated, that, the, work, would, take, up, to, two, years, since, he, was, not, allowed, to, simply, copy, the, data, for, his, own, use, with, the, help, of, johannes, jessenius, kepler, attempted, to, negotiate, a, more, formal, employment, arrangement, with, tycho, but, negotiations, broke, down, in, an, angry, argument, and, kepler, left, for, prague, on, 6, april, kepler, and, tycho, soon, reconciled, and, eventually, reached, an, agreement, on, salary, and, living, arrangements, and, in, june, kepler, returned, home, to, graz, to, collect, his, family, political, and, religious, difficulties, in, graz, dashed, his, hopes, of, returning, immediately, to, brahe, in, hopes, of, continuing, his, astronomical, studies, kepler, sought, an, appointment, as, a, mathematician, to, archduke, ferdinand, to, that, end, kepler, composed, an, essay, dedicated, to, ferdinand, in, which, he, proposed, a, force, based, theory, of, lunar, motion, in, terra, inest, virtus, quae, lunam, ciet, there, is, a, force, in, the, earth, which, causes, the, moon, to, move, though, the, essay, did, not, earn, him, a, place, in, ferdinand, s, court, it, did, detail, a, new, method, for, measuring, lunar, eclipses, which, he, applied, during, the, 10, july, eclipse, in, graz, these, observations, formed, the, basis, of, his, explorations, of, the, laws, of, optics, that, would, culminate, in, astronomiae, pars, optica, on, 2, august, 1600, after, refusing, to, convert, to, catholicism, kepler, and, his, family, were, banished, from, graz, several, months, later, kepler, returned, now, with, the, rest, of, his, household, to, prague, through, most, of, 1601, he, was, supported, directly, by, tycho, who, assigned, him, to, analyzing, planetary, observations, and, writing, a, tract, against, tycho, s, by, then, deceased, rival, ursus, in, september, tycho, secured, him, a, commission, as, a, collaborator, on, the, new, project, he, had, proposed, to, the, emperor, the, rudolphine, tables, that, should, replace, the, prutenic, tables, of, erasmus, reinhold, two, days, after, tycho, s, unexpected, death, on, 24, october, 1601, kepler, was, appointed, his, successor, as, the, imperial, mathematician, with, the, responsibility, to, complete, his, unfinished, work, the, next, 11, years, as, imperial, mathematician, would, be, the, most, productive, of, his, life, kepler, s, primary, obligation, as, imperial, mathematician, was, to, provide, astrological, advice, to, the, emperor, though, kepler, took, a, dim, view, of, the, attempts, of, contemporary, astrologers, to, precisely, predict, the, future, or, divine, specific, events, he, had, been, casting, well, received, detailed, horoscopes, for, friends, family, and, patrons, since, his, time, as, a, student, in, t, bingen, in, addition, to, horoscopes, for, allies, and, foreign, leaders, the, emperor, sought, kepler, s, advice, in, times, of, political, trouble, rudolf, was, actively, interested, in, the, work, of, many, of, his, court, scholars, including, numerous, alchemists, and, kept, up, with, kepler, s, work, in, physical, astronomy, as, well, officially, the, only, acceptable, religious, doctrines, in, prague, were, catholic, and, utraquist, but, kepler, s, position, in, the, imperial, court, allowed, him, to, practice, his, lutheran, faith, unhindered, the, emperor, nominally, provided, an, ample, income, for, his, family, but, the, difficulties, of, the, over, extended, imperial, treasury, meant, that, actually, getting, hold, of, enough, money, to, meet, financial, obligations, was, a, continual, struggle, partly, because, of, financial, troubles, his, life, at, home, with, barbara, was, unpleasant, marred, with, bickering, and, bouts, of, sickness, court, life, however, brought, kepler, into, contact, with, other, prominent, scholars, johannes, matth, us, wackher, von, wackhenfels, jost, b, rgi, david, fabricius, martin, bachazek, and, johannes, brengger, among, others, and, astronomical, work, proceeded, rapidly, in, october, 1604, a, bright, new, evening, star, sn, 1604, appeared, but, kepler, did, not, believe, the, rumors, until, he, saw, it, himself, kepler, began, systematically, observing, the, supernova, astrologically, the, end, of, 1603, marked, the, beginning, of, a, fiery, trigon, the, start, of, the, about, 800, year, cycle, of, great, conjunctions, astrologers, associated, the, two, previous, such, periods, with, the, rise, of, charlemagne, c, 800, years, earlier, and, the, birth, of, christ, c, 1600, years, earlier, and, thus, expected, events, of, great, portent, especially, regarding, the, emperor, it, was, in, this, context, as, the, imperial, mathematician, and, astrologer, to, the, emperor, that, kepler, described, the, new, star, two, years, later, in, his, de, stella, nova, in, it, kepler, addressed, the, star, s, astronomical, properties, while, taking, a, skeptical, approach, to, the, many, astrological, interpretations, then, circulating, he, noted, its, fading, luminosity, speculated, about, its, origin, and, used, the, lack, of, observed, parallax, to, argue, that, it, was, in, the, sphere, of, fixed, stars, further, undermining, the, doctrine, of, the, immutability, of, the, heavens, the, idea, accepted, since, aristotle, that, the, celestial, spheres, were, perfect, and, unchanging, the, birth, of, a, new, star, implied, the, variability, of, the, heavens, kepler, also, attached, an, appendix, where, he, discussed, the, recent, chronology, work, of, the, polish, historian, laurentius, suslyga, he, calculated, that, if, suslyga, was, correct, that, accepted, timelines, were, four, years, behind, then, the, star, of, bethlehem, analogous, to, the, present, new, star, would, have, coincided, with, the, first, great, conjunction, of, the, earlier, 800, year, cycle, over, the, following, years, kepler, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, begin, a, collaboration, with, italian, astronomer, giovanni, antonio, magini, and, dealt, with, chronology, especially, the, dating, of, events, in, the, life, of, jesus, around, 1611, kepler, circulated, a, manuscript, of, what, would, eventually, be, published, posthumously, as, somnium, part, of, the, purpose, of, somnium, was, to, describe, what, practicing, astronomy, would, be, like, from, the, perspective, of, another, planet, to, show, the, feasibility, of, a, non, geocentric, system, the, manuscript, which, disappeared, after, changing, hands, several, times, described, a, fantastic, trip, to, the, moon, it, was, part, allegory, part, autobiography, and, part, treatise, on, interplanetary, travel, and, is, sometimes, described, as, the, first, work, of, science, fiction, years, later, a, distorted, version, of, the, story, may, have, instigated, the, witchcraft, trial, against, his, mother, as, the, mother, of, the, narrator, consults, a, demon, to, learn, the, means, of, space, travel, following, her, eventual, acquittal, kepler, composed, 223, footnotes, to, the, story, several, times, longer, than, the, actual, text, which, explained, the, allegorical, aspects, as, well, as, the, considerable, scientific, content, particularly, regarding, lunar, geography, hidden, within, the, text, in, 1611, the, growing, political, religious, tension, in, prague, came, to, a, head, emperor, rudolf, whose, health, was, failing, was, forced, to, abdicate, as, king, of, bohemia, by, his, brother, matthias, both, sides, sought, kepler, s, astrological, advice, an, opportunity, he, used, to, deliver, conciliatory, political, advice, with, little, reference, to, the, stars, except, in, general, statements, to, discourage, drastic, action, however, it, was, clear, that, kepler, s, future, prospects, in, the, court, of, matthias, were, dim, also, in, that, year, barbara, kepler, contracted, hungarian, spotted, fever, then, began, having, seizures, as, barbara, was, recovering, kepler, s, three, children, all, fell, sick, with, smallpox, friedrich, 6, died, following, his, son, s, death, kepler, sent, letters, to, potential, patrons, in, w, rttemberg, and, padua, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, in, w, rttemberg, concerns, over, kepler, s, perceived, calvinist, heresies, in, violation, of, the, augsburg, confession, and, the, formula, of, concord, prevented, his, return, the, university, of, padua, on, the, recommendation, of, the, departing, galileo, sought, kepler, to, fill, the, mathematics, professorship, but, kepler, preferring, to, keep, his, family, in, german, territory, instead, travelled, to, austria, to, arrange, a, position, as, teacher, and, district, mathematician, in, linz, however, barbara, relapsed, into, illness, and, died, shortly, after, kepler, s, return, kepler, postponed, the, move, to, linz, and, remained, in, prague, until, rudolf, s, death, in, early, 1612, though, between, political, upheaval, religious, tension, and, family, tragedy, along, with, the, legal, dispute, over, his, wife, s, estate, kepler, could, do, no, research, instead, he, pieced, together, a, chronology, manuscript, eclogae, chronicae, from, correspondence, and, earlier, work, upon, succession, as, holy, roman, emperor, matthias, re, affirmed, kepler, s, position, and, salary, as, imperial, mathematician, but, allowed, him, to, move, to, linz, in, linz, kepler, s, primary, responsibilities, beyond, completing, the, rudolphine, tables, were, teaching, at, the, district, school, and, providing, astrological, and, astronomical, services, in, his, first, years, there, he, enjoyed, financial, security, and, religious, freedom, relative, to, his, life, in, prague, though, he, was, excluded, from, eucharist, by, his, lutheran, church, over, his, theological, scruples, it, was, also, during, his, time, in, linz, that, kepler, had, to, deal, with, the, accusation, and, ultimate, verdict, of, witchcraft, against, his, mother, katharina, in, the, protestant, town, of, leonberg, that, blow, happening, only, a, few, years, after, kepler, s, excommunication, is, not, seen, as, a, coincidence, but, as, a, symptom, of, the, full, fledged, assault, waged, by, the, lutherans, against, kepler, his, first, publication, in, linz, was, de, vero, anno, 1613, an, expanded, treatise, on, the, year, of, christ, s, birth, he, also, participated, in, deliberations, on, whether, to, introduce, pope, gregory, s, reformed, calendar, to, protestant, german, lands, on, 30, october, 1613, kepler, married, susanna, reuttinger, following, the, death, of, his, first, wife, barbara, kepler, had, considered, 11, different, matches, over, two, years, a, decision, process, formalized, later, as, the, marriage, problem, he, eventually, returned, to, reuttinger, the, fifth, match, who, he, wrote, won, me, over, with, love, humble, loyalty, economy, of, household, diligence, and, the, love, she, gave, the, stepchildren, the, first, three, children, of, this, marriage, margareta, regina, katharina, and, sebald, died, in, childhood, three, more, survived, into, adulthood, cordula, born, 1621, fridmar, born, 1623, and, hildebert, born, 1625, according, to, kepler, s, biographers, this, was, a, much, happier, marriage, than, his, first, on, 8, october, 1630, kepler, set, out, for, regensburg, hoping, to, collect, interest, on, work, he, had, done, previously, a, few, days, after, reaching, regensburg, kepler, became, sick, and, progressively, became, worse, on, 15, november, 1630, just, over, a, month, after, his, arrival, he, died, he, was, buried, in, a, protestant, churchyard, that, was, completely, destroyed, during, the, thirty, years, war, kepler, s, belief, that, god, created, the, cosmos, in, an, orderly, fashion, caused, him, to, attempt, to, determine, and, comprehend, the, laws, that, govern, the, natural, world, most, profoundly, in, astronomy, the, phrase, i, am, merely, thinking, god, s, thoughts, after, him, has, been, attributed, to, him, although, this, is, probably, a, capsulized, version, of, a, writing, from, his, hand, those, laws, are, within, the, grasp, of, the, human, mind, god, wanted, us, to, recognize, them, by, creating, us, after, his, own, image, so, that, we, could, share, in, his, own, thoughts, kepler, advocated, for, tolerance, among, christian, denominations, for, example, arguing, that, catholics, and, lutherans, should, be, able, to, take, communion, together, he, wrote, christ, the, lord, neither, was, nor, is, lutheran, nor, calvinist, nor, papist, kepler, s, first, major, astronomical, work, mysterium, cosmographicum, the, cosmographic, mystery, 1596, was, the, first, published, defense, of, the, copernican, system, kepler, claimed, to, have, had, an, epiphany, on, 19, july, 1595, while, teaching, in, graz, demonstrating, the, periodic, conjunction, of, saturn, and, jupiter, in, the, zodiac, he, realized, that, regular, polygons, bound, one, inscribed, and, one, circumscribed, circle, at, definite, ratios, which, he, reasoned, might, be, the, geometrical, basis, of, the, universe, after, failing, to, find, a, unique, arrangement, of, polygons, that, fit, known, astronomical, observations, even, with, extra, planets, added, to, the, system, kepler, began, experimenting, with, 3, dimensional, polyhedra, he, found, that, each, of, the, five, platonic, solids, could, be, inscribed, and, circumscribed, by, spherical, orbs, nesting, these, solids, each, encased, in, a, sphere, within, one, another, would, produce, six, layers, corresponding, to, the, six, known, planets, mercury, venus, earth, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, by, ordering, the, solids, selectively, octahedron, icosahedron, dodecahedron, tetrahedron, cube, kepler, found, that, the, spheres, could, be, placed, at, intervals, corresponding, to, the, relative, sizes, of, each, planet, s, path, assuming, the, planets, circle, the, sun, kepler, also, found, a, formula, relating, the, size, of, each, planet, s, orb, to, the, length, of, its, orbital, period, from, inner, to, outer, planets, the, ratio, of, increase, in, orbital, period, is, twice, the, difference, in, orb, radius, however, kepler, later, rejected, this, formula, because, it, was, not, precise, enough, kepler, thought, the, mysterium, had, revealed, god, s, geometrical, plan, for, the, universe, much, of, kepler, s, enthusiasm, for, the, copernican, system, stemmed, from, his, theological, convictions, about, the, connection, between, the, physical, and, the, spiritual, the, universe, itself, was, an, image, of, god, with, the, sun, corresponding, to, the, father, the, stellar, sphere, to, the, son, and, the, intervening, space, between, them, to, the, holy, spirit, his, first, manuscript, of, mysterium, contained, an, extensive, chapter, reconciling, heliocentrism, with, biblical, passages, that, seemed, to, support, geocentrism, with, the, support, of, his, mentor, michael, maestlin, kepler, received, permission, from, the, t, bingen, university, senate, to, publish, his, manuscript, pending, removal, of, the, bible, exegesis, and, the, addition, of, a, simpler, more, understandable, description, of, the, copernican, system, as, well, as, kepler, s, new, ideas, mysterium, was, published, late, in, 1596, and, kepler, received, his, copies, and, began, sending, them, to, prominent, astronomers, and, patrons, early, in, 1597, it, was, not, widely, read, but, it, established, kepler, s, reputation, as, a, highly, skilled, astronomer, the, effusive, dedication, to, powerful, patrons, as, well, as, to, the, men, who, controlled, his, position, in, graz, also, provided, a, crucial, doorway, into, the, patronage, system, in, 1621, kepler, published, an, expanded, second, edition, of, mysterium, half, as, long, again, as, the, first, detailing, in, footnotes, the, corrections, and, improvements, he, had, achieved, in, the, 25, years, since, its, first, publication, in, terms, of, impact, the, mysterium, can, be, seen, as, an, important, first, step, in, modernizing, the, theory, proposed, by, copernicus, in, his, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, while, copernicus, sought, to, advance, a, heliocentric, system, in, this, book, he, resorted, to, ptolemaic, devices, viz, epicycles, and, eccentric, circles, in, order, to, explain, the, change, in, planets, orbital, speed, and, also, continued, to, use, as, a, point, of, reference, the, center, of, the, earth, s, orbit, rather, than, that, of, the, sun, as, an, aid, to, calculation, and, in, order, not, to, confuse, the, reader, by, diverging, too, much, from, ptolemy, modern, astronomy, owes, much, to, mysterium, cosmographicum, despite, flaws, in, its, main, thesis, since, it, represents, the, first, step, in, cleansing, the, copernican, system, of, the, remnants, of, the, ptolemaic, theory, still, clinging, to, it, the, extended, line, of, research, that, culminated, in, astronomia, nova, a, new, astronomy, including, the, first, two, laws, of, planetary, motion, began, with, the, analysis, under, tycho, s, direction, of, the, orbit, of, mars, in, this, work, kepler, introduced, the, revolutionary, concept, of, planetary, orbit, a, path, of, a, planet, in, space, resulting, from, the, action, of, physical, causes, distinct, from, previously, held, notion, of, planetary, orb, a, spherical, shell, to, which, planet, is, attached, as, a, result, of, this, breakthrough, astronomical, phenomena, came, to, be, seen, as, being, governed, by, physical, laws, kepler, calculated, and, recalculated, various, approximations, of, mars, s, orbit, using, an, equant, the, mathematical, tool, that, copernicus, had, eliminated, with, his, system, eventually, creating, a, model, that, generally, agreed, with, tycho, s, observations, to, within, two, arcminutes, the, average, measurement, error, but, he, was, not, satisfied, with, the, complex, and, still, slightly, inaccurate, result, at, certain, points, the, model, differed, from, the, data, by, up, to, eight, arcminutes, the, wide, array, of, traditional, mathematical, astronomy, methods, having, failed, him, kepler, set, about, trying, to, fit, an, ovoid, orbit, to, the, data, in, kepler, s, religious, view, of, the, cosmos, the, sun, a, symbol, of, god, the, father, was, the, source, of, motive, force, in, the, solar, system, as, a, physical, basis, kepler, drew, by, analogy, on, william, gilbert, s, theory, of, the, magnetic, soul, of, the, earth, from, de, magnete, 1600, and, on, his, own, work, on, optics, kepler, supposed, that, the, motive, power, or, motive, species, radiated, by, the, sun, weakens, with, distance, causing, faster, or, slower, motion, as, planets, move, closer, or, farther, from, it, perhaps, this, assumption, entailed, a, mathematical, relationship, that, would, restore, astronomical, order, based, on, measurements, of, the, aphelion, and, perihelion, of, the, earth, and, mars, he, created, a, formula, in, which, a, planet, s, rate, of, motion, is, inversely, proportional, to, its, distance, from, the, sun, verifying, this, relationship, throughout, the, orbital, cycle, required, very, extensive, calculation, to, simplify, this, task, by, late, 1602, kepler, reformulated, the, proportion, in, terms, of, geometry, planets, sweep, out, equal, areas, in, equal, times, his, second, law, of, planetary, motion, he, then, set, about, calculating, the, entire, orbit, of, mars, using, the, geometrical, rate, law, and, assuming, an, egg, shaped, ovoid, orbit, after, approximately, 40, failed, attempts, in, late, 1604, he, at, last, hit, upon, the, idea, of, an, ellipse, which, he, had, previously, assumed, to, be, too, simple, a, solution, for, earlier, astronomers, to, have, overlooked, finding, that, an, elliptical, orbit, fit, the, mars, data, the, vicarious, hypothesis, kepler, immediately, concluded, that, all, planets, move, in, ellipses, with, the, sun, at, one, focus, his, first, law, of, planetary, motion, because, he, employed, no, calculating, assistants, he, did, not, extend, the, mathematical, analysis, beyond, mars, by, the, end, of, the, year, he, completed, the, manuscript, for, astronomia, nova, though, it, would, not, be, published, until, 1609, due, to, legal, disputes, over, the, use, of, tycho, s, observations, the, property, of, his, heirs, since, completing, the, astronomia, nova, kepler, had, intended, to, compose, an, astronomy, textbook, that, would, cover, all, the, fundamentals, of, heliocentric, astronomy, kepler, spent, the, next, several, years, working, on, what, would, become, epitome, astronomiae, copernicanae, epitome, of, copernican, astronomy, despite, its, title, which, merely, hints, at, heliocentrism, the, epitome, is, less, about, copernicus, s, work, and, more, about, kepler, s, own, astronomical, system, the, epitome, contained, all, three, laws, of, planetary, motion, and, attempted, to, explain, heavenly, motions, through, physical, causes, although, it, explicitly, extended, the, first, two, laws, of, planetary, motion, applied, to, mars, in, astronomia, nova, to, all, the, planets, as, well, as, the, moon, and, the, medicean, satellites, of, jupiter, it, did, not, explain, how, elliptical, orbits, could, be, derived, from, observational, data, originally, intended, as, an, introduction, for, the, uninitiated, kepler, sought, to, model, his, epitome, after, that, of, his, master, michael, maestlin, who, published, a, well, regarded, book, explaining, the, basics, of, geocentric, astronomy, to, non, experts, kepler, completed, the, first, of, three, volumes, consisting, of, books, i, iii, by, 1615, in, the, same, question, answer, format, of, maestlin, s, and, have, it, printed, in, 1617, however, the, banning, of, copernican, books, by, the, catholic, church, as, well, as, the, start, of, the, thirty, years, war, meant, that, publication, of, the, next, two, volumes, would, be, delayed, in, the, interim, and, to, avoid, being, subject, to, the, ban, kepler, switched, the, audience, of, the, epitome, from, beginners, to, that, of, expert, astronomers, and, mathematicians, as, the, arguments, became, more, and, more, sophisticated, and, required, advanced, mathematics, to, be, understood, the, second, volume, consisting, of, book, iv, was, published, in, 1620, followed, by, the, third, volume, consisting, of, books, v, vii, in, 1621, in, the, years, following, the, completion, of, astronomia, nova, most, of, kepler, s, research, was, focused, on, preparations, for, the, rudolphine, tables, and, a, comprehensive, set, of, ephemerides, specific, predictions, of, planet, and, star, positions, based, on, the, table, though, neither, would, be, completed, for, many, years, kepler, at, last, completed, the, rudolphine, tables, in, 1623, which, at, the, time, was, considered, his, major, work, however, due, to, the, publishing, requirements, of, the, emperor, and, negotiations, with, tycho, brahe, s, heir, it, would, not, be, printed, until, 1627, like, ptolemy, kepler, considered, astrology, as, the, counterpart, to, astronomy, and, as, being, of, equal, interest, and, value, however, in, the, following, years, the, two, subjects, drifted, apart, until, astrology, was, no, longer, practiced, among, professional, astronomers, sir, oliver, lodge, observed, that, kepler, was, somewhat, disdainful, of, astrology, in, his, own, day, as, he, was, continually, attacking, and, throwing, sarcasm, at, astrology, but, it, was, the, only, thing, for, which, people, would, pay, him, and, on, it, after, a, fashion, he, lived, nonetheless, kepler, spent, a, huge, amount, of, time, trying, to, restore, astrology, on, a, firmer, philosophical, footing, composing, numerous, astrological, calendars, more, than, 800, nativities, and, a, number, of, treaties, dealing, with, the, subject, of, astrology, proper, in, his, bid, to, become, imperial, astronomer, kepler, wrote, de, fundamentis, 1601, whose, full, title, can, be, translated, as, on, giving, astrology, sounder, foundations, as, a, short, foreword, to, one, of, his, yearly, almanacs, in, this, work, kepler, describes, the, effects, of, the, sun, moon, and, the, planets, in, terms, of, their, light, and, their, influences, upon, humors, finalizing, with, kepler, s, view, that, the, earth, possesses, a, soul, with, some, sense, of, geometry, stimulated, by, the, geometric, convergence, of, rays, formed, around, it, the, world, soul, is, sentient, but, not, conscious, as, a, shepherd, is, pleased, by, the, piping, of, a, flute, without, understanding, the, theory, of, musical, harmony, so, likewise, earth, responds, to, the, angles, and, aspects, made, by, the, heavens, but, not, in, a, conscious, manner, eclipses, are, important, as, omens, because, the, animal, faculty, of, the, earth, is, violently, disturbed, by, the, sudden, intermission, of, light, experiencing, something, like, emotion, and, persisting, in, it, for, some, time, kepler, surmises, that, the, earth, has, cycles, of, humors, as, living, animals, do, and, gives, for, an, example, that, the, highest, tides, of, the, sea, are, said, by, sailors, to, return, after, nineteen, years, around, the, same, days, of, the, year, this, may, refer, to, the, 18, 6, year, lunar, node, precession, cycle, kepler, advocates, searching, for, such, cycles, by, gathering, observations, over, a, period, of, many, years, and, so, far, this, observation, has, not, been, made, kepler, and, helisaeus, roeslin, engaged, in, a, series, of, published, attacks, and, counter, attacks, on, the, importance, of, astrology, after, the, supernova, of, 1604, around, the, same, time, physician, philip, feselius, published, a, work, dismissing, astrology, altogether, and, roeslin, s, work, in, particular, in, response, to, what, kepler, saw, as, the, excesses, of, astrology, on, the, one, hand, and, overzealous, rejection, of, it, on, the, other, kepler, prepared, tertius, interveniens, 1610, nominally, this, work, presented, to, the, common, patron, of, roeslin, and, feselius, was, a, neutral, mediation, between, the, feuding, scholars, the, titled, meaning, third, party, interventions, but, it, also, set, out, kepler, s, general, views, on, the, value, of, astrology, including, some, hypothesized, mechanisms, of, interaction, between, planets, and, individual, souls, while, kepler, considered, most, traditional, rules, and, methods, of, astrology, to, be, the, evil, smelling, dung, in, which, an, industrious, hen, scrapes, there, was, an, occasional, grain, seed, indeed, even, a, pearl, or, a, gold, nugget, to, be, found, by, the, conscientious, scientific, astrologer, kepler, was, convinced, that, the, geometrical, things, have, provided, the, creator, with, the, model, for, decorating, the, whole, world, in, harmonice, mundi, 1619, he, attempted, to, explain, the, proportions, of, the, natural, world, particularly, the, astronomical, and, astrological, aspects, in, terms, of, music, the, central, set, of, harmonies, was, the, musica, universalis, or, music, of, the, spheres, which, had, been, studied, by, pythagoras, ptolemy, and, others, before, kepler, in, fact, soon, after, publishing, harmonice, mundi, kepler, was, embroiled, in, a, priority, dispute, with, robert, fludd, who, had, recently, published, his, own, harmonic, theory, kepler, began, by, exploring, regular, polygons, and, regular, solids, including, the, figures, that, would, come, to, be, known, as, kepler, s, solids, from, there, he, extended, his, harmonic, analysis, to, music, meteorology, and, astrology, harmony, resulted, from, the, tones, made, by, the, souls, of, heavenly, bodies, and, in, the, case, of, astrology, the, interaction, between, those, tones, and, human, souls, in, the, final, portion, of, the, work, book, v, kepler, dealt, with, planetary, motions, especially, relationships, between, orbital, velocity, and, orbital, distance, from, the, sun, similar, relationships, had, been, used, by, other, astronomers, but, kepler, with, tycho, s, data, and, his, own, astronomical, theories, treated, them, much, more, precisely, and, attached, new, physical, significance, to, them, among, many, other, harmonies, kepler, articulated, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, third, law, of, planetary, motion, he, tried, many, combinations, until, he, discovered, that, approximately, the, square, of, the, periodic, times, are, to, each, other, as, the, cubes, of, the, mean, distances, although, he, gives, the, date, of, this, epiphany, 8, march, 1618, he, does, not, give, any, details, about, how, he, arrived, at, this, conclusion, however, the, wider, significance, for, planetary, dynamics, of, this, purely, kinematical, law, was, not, realized, until, the, 1660s, when, conjoined, with, christiaan, huygens, newly, discovered, law, of, centrifugal, force, it, enabled, isaac, newton, edmund, halley, and, perhaps, christopher, wren, and, robert, hooke, to, demonstrate, independently, that, the, presumed, gravitational, attraction, between, the, sun, and, its, planets, decreased, with, the, square, of, the, distance, between, them, this, refuted, the, traditional, assumption, of, scholastic, physics, that, the, power, of, gravitational, attraction, remained, constant, with, distance, whenever, it, applied, between, two, bodies, such, as, was, assumed, by, kepler, and, also, by, galileo, in, his, mistaken, universal, law, that, gravitational, fall, is, uniformly, accelerated, and, also, by, galileo, s, student, borrelli, in, his, 1666, celestial, mechanics, as, kepler, slowly, continued, analyzing, tycho, s, mars, observations, now, available, to, him, in, their, entirety, and, began, the, slow, process, of, tabulating, the, rudolphine, tables, kepler, also, picked, up, the, investigation, of, the, laws, of, optics, from, his, lunar, essay, of, 1600, both, lunar, and, solar, eclipses, presented, unexplained, phenomena, such, as, unexpected, shadow, sizes, the, red, color, of, a, total, lunar, eclipse, and, the, reportedly, unusual, light, surrounding, a, total, solar, eclipse, related, issues, of, atmospheric, refraction, applied, to, all, astronomical, observations, through, most, of, 1603, kepler, paused, his, other, work, to, focus, on, optical, theory, the, resulting, manuscript, presented, to, the, emperor, on, 1, january, 1604, was, published, as, astronomiae, pars, optica, the, optical, part, of, astronomy, in, it, kepler, described, the, inverse, square, law, governing, the, intensity, of, light, reflection, by, flat, and, curved, mirrors, and, principles, of, pinhole, cameras, as, well, as, the, astronomical, implications, of, optics, such, as, parallax, and, the, apparent, sizes, of, heavenly, bodies, he, also, extended, his, study, of, optics, to, the, human, eye, and, is, generally, considered, by, neuroscientists, to, be, the, first, to, recognize, that, images, are, projected, inverted, and, reversed, by, the, eye, s, lens, onto, the, retina, the, solution, to, this, dilemma, was, not, of, particular, importance, to, kepler, as, he, did, not, see, it, as, pertaining, to, optics, although, he, did, suggest, that, the, image, was, later, corrected, in, the, hollows, of, the, brain, due, to, the, activity, of, the, soul, today, astronomiae, pars, optica, is, generally, recognized, as, the, foundation, of, modern, optics, though, the, law, of, refraction, is, conspicuously, absent, with, respect, to, the, beginnings, of, projective, geometry, kepler, introduced, the, idea, of, continuous, change, of, a, mathematical, entity, in, this, work, he, argued, that, if, a, focus, of, a, conic, section, were, allowed, to, move, along, the, line, joining, the, foci, the, geometric, form, would, morph, or, degenerate, one, into, another, in, this, way, an, ellipse, becomes, a, parabola, when, a, focus, moves, toward, infinity, and, when, two, foci, of, an, ellipse, merge, into, one, another, a, circle, is, formed, as, the, foci, of, a, hyperbola, merge, into, one, another, the, hyperbola, becomes, a, pair, of, straight, lines, he, also, assumed, that, if, a, straight, line, is, extended, to, infinity, it, will, meet, itself, at, a, single, point, at, infinity, thus, having, the, properties, of, a, large, circle, in, the, first, months, of, 1610, galileo, galilei, using, his, powerful, new, telescope, discovered, four, satellites, orbiting, jupiter, upon, publishing, his, account, as, sidereus, nuncius, galileo, sought, the, opinion, of, kepler, in, part, to, bolster, the, credibility, of, his, observations, kepler, responded, enthusiastically, with, a, short, published, reply, dissertatio, cum, nuncio, sidereo, he, endorsed, galileo, s, observations, and, offered, a, range, of, speculations, about, the, meaning, and, implications, of, galileo, s, discoveries, and, telescopic, methods, for, astronomy, and, optics, as, well, as, cosmology, and, astrology, later, that, year, kepler, published, his, own, telescopic, observations, of, the, moons, in, narratio, de, jovis, satellitibus, providing, further, support, of, galileo, to, kepler, s, disappointment, however, galileo, never, published, his, reactions, if, any, to, astronomia, nova, kepler, also, started, a, theoretical, and, experimental, investigation, of, telescopic, lenses, using, a, telescope, borrowed, from, duke, ernest, of, cologne, the, resulting, manuscript, was, completed, in, september, 1610, and, published, as, dioptrice, in, 1611, in, it, kepler, set, out, the, theoretical, basis, of, double, convex, converging, lenses, and, double, concave, diverging, lenses, and, how, they, are, combined, to, produce, a, galilean, telescope, as, well, as, the, concepts, of, real, vs, virtual, images, upright, vs, inverted, images, and, the, effects, of, focal, length, on, magnification, and, reduction, he, also, described, an, improved, telescope, now, known, as, the, astronomical, or, keplerian, telescope, in, which, two, convex, lenses, can, produce, higher, magnification, than, galileo, s, combination, of, convex, and, concave, lenses, as, a, new, year, s, gift, that, year, 1611, he, also, composed, for, his, friend, and, some, time, patron, baron, wackher, von, wackhenfels, a, short, pamphlet, entitled, strena, seu, de, nive, sexangula, a, new, year, s, gift, of, hexagonal, snow, in, this, treatise, he, published, the, first, description, of, the, hexagonal, symmetry, of, snowflakes, and, extending, the, discussion, into, a, hypothetical, atomistic, physical, basis, for, the, symmetry, posed, what, later, became, known, as, the, kepler, conjecture, a, statement, about, the, most, efficient, arrangement, for, packing, spheres, kepler, wrote, the, influential, mathematical, treatise, nova, stereometria, doliorum, vinariorum, in, 1613, on, measuring, the, volume, of, containers, such, as, wine, barrels, which, was, published, in, 1615, kepler, also, contributed, to, the, development, of, infinitesimal, methods, and, numerical, analysis, including, iterative, approximations, infinitesimals, and, the, early, use, of, logarithms, and, transcendental, equations, kepler, s, work, on, calculating, volumes, of, shapes, and, on, finding, the, optimal, shape, of, a, wine, barrel, were, significant, steps, toward, the, development, of, calculus, simpson, s, rule, an, approximation, method, used, in, integral, calculus, is, known, in, german, as, keplersche, fassregel, kepler, s, barrel, rule, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, were, not, immediately, accepted, several, major, figures, such, as, galileo, and, ren, descartes, completely, ignored, kepler, s, astronomia, nova, many, astronomers, including, kepler, s, teacher, michael, maestlin, objected, to, kepler, s, introduction, of, physics, into, his, astronomy, some, adopted, compromise, positions, isma, l, bullialdus, accepted, elliptical, orbits, but, replaced, kepler, s, area, law, with, uniform, motion, in, respect, to, the, empty, focus, of, the, ellipse, while, seth, ward, used, an, elliptical, orbit, with, motions, defined, by, an, equant, several, astronomers, tested, kepler, s, theory, and, its, various, modifications, against, astronomical, observations, two, transits, of, venus, and, mercury, across, the, face, of, the, sun, provided, sensitive, tests, of, the, theory, under, circumstances, when, these, planets, could, not, normally, be, observed, in, the, case, of, the, transit, of, mercury, in, 1631, kepler, had, been, extremely, uncertain, of, the, parameters, for, mercury, and, advised, observers, to, look, for, the, transit, the, day, before, and, after, the, predicted, date, pierre, gassendi, observed, the, transit, on, the, date, predicted, a, confirmation, of, kepler, s, prediction, this, was, the, first, observation, of, a, transit, of, mercury, however, his, attempt, to, observe, the, transit, of, venus, just, one, month, later, was, unsuccessful, due, to, inaccuracies, in, the, rudolphine, tables, gassendi, did, not, realize, that, it, was, not, visible, from, most, of, europe, including, paris, jeremiah, horrocks, who, observed, the, 1639, venus, transit, had, used, his, own, observations, to, adjust, the, parameters, of, the, keplerian, model, predicted, the, transit, and, then, built, apparatus, to, observe, the, transit, he, remained, a, firm, advocate, of, the, keplerian, model, epitome, of, copernican, astronomy, was, read, by, astronomers, throughout, europe, and, following, kepler, s, death, it, was, the, main, vehicle, for, spreading, kepler, s, ideas, in, the, period, 1630, 1650, this, book, was, the, most, widely, used, astronomy, textbook, winning, many, converts, to, ellipse, based, astronomy, however, few, adopted, his, ideas, on, the, physical, basis, for, celestial, motions, in, the, late, 17th, century, a, number, of, physical, astronomy, theories, drawing, from, kepler, s, work, notably, those, of, giovanni, alfonso, borelli, and, robert, hooke, began, to, incorporate, attractive, forces, though, not, the, quasi, spiritual, motive, species, postulated, by, kepler, and, the, cartesian, concept, of, inertia, this, culminated, in, isaac, newton, s, principia, mathematica, 1687, in, which, newton, derived, kepler, s, laws, of, planetary, motion, from, a, force, based, theory, of, universal, gravitation, a, mathematical, challenge, later, known, as, solving, the, kepler, problem, beyond, his, role, in, the, historical, development, of, astronomy, and, natural, philosophy, kepler, has, loomed, large, in, the, philosophy, and, historiography, of, science, kepler, and, his, laws, of, motion, were, central, to, early, histories, of, astronomy, such, as, jean, tienne, montucla, s, 1758, histoire, des, math, matiques, and, jean, baptiste, delambre, s, 1821, histoire, de, l, astronomie, moderne, these, and, other, histories, written, from, an, enlightenment, perspective, treated, kepler, s, metaphysical, and, religious, arguments, with, skepticism, and, disapproval, but, later, romantic, era, natural, philosophers, viewed, these, elements, as, central, to, his, success, william, whewell, in, his, influential, history, of, the, inductive, sciences, of, 1837, found, kepler, to, be, the, archetype, of, the, inductive, scientific, genius, in, his, philosophy, of, the, inductive, sciences, of, 1840, whewell, held, kepler, up, as, the, embodiment, of, the, most, advanced, forms, of, scientific, method, similarly, ernst, friedrich, apelt, the, first, to, extensively, study, kepler, s, manuscripts, after, their, purchase, by, catherine, the, great, identified, kepler, as, a, key, to, the, revolution, of, the, sciences, apelt, who, saw, kepler, s, mathematics, aesthetic, sensibility, physical, ideas, and, theology, as, part, of, a, unified, system, of, thought, produced, the, first, extended, analysis, of, kepler, s, life, and, work, alexandre, koyr, s, work, on, kepler, was, after, apelt, the, first, major, milestone, in, historical, interpretations, of, kepler, s, cosmology, and, its, influence, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, koyr, and, a, number, of, others, in, the, first, generation, of, professional, historians, of, science, described, the, scientific, revolution, as, the, central, event, in, the, history, of, science, and, kepler, as, a, perhaps, the, central, figure, in, the, revolution, koyr, placed, kepler, s, theorization, rather, than, his, empirical, work, at, the, center, of, the, intellectual, transformation,

1998, 2014, kepler, has, acquired, a, popular, image, as, an, icon, of, scientific, modernity, and, a, man, before, his, time, science, popularizer, carl, sagan, described, him, as, the, first, astrophysicist, and, the, last, scientific, astrologer, the, debate, over, kepler, s, place, in, the, scientific, revolution, has, produced, a, wide, variety, of, philosophical, and, popular, treatments, one, of, the, most, influential, is, arthur, koestler, s, 1959, the, sleepwalkers, in, which, kepler, is, unambiguously, the, hero, morally, and, theologically, as, well, as,

however, the, credibility, of, this, is, proved, by, the, comparison, of, the, four, of, jupiter, and, jupiter, with, the, six, planets, and, the, sun, because, regarding, the, body, of, jupiter, whether, it, turns, around, its, axis, we, don, t, have, proofs, for, what, suffices, for, us, the, body, of, the, earth, and, especially, of, the, sun, certainly, but, reason, attests, that, just, as, it, is, clearly, among, the, six, planets, around, the, sun, so, also, it, is, among, the, four, of, jupiter, because, around, the, body, of, jupiter, any, that, can, go, farther, from, it, orbits, slower, and, even, that, is, not, in, the, same, proportion, but, greater, that, is, 3, 2, sescupla, of, the, proportion, of, each, of, the, distances, from, jupiter, which, is, clearly, the, very, as, the, six, planets, above, in, his, the, world, of, jupiter, mayr, presents, these, distances, from, jupiter, of, the, four, of, jupiter, 3, 5, 8, 13, or, 14, galileo, mayr, presents, their, time, periods, 1, day, 18, 1, 2, hours, 3, days, 13, 1, 3, hours, 7, days, 3, hours, 16, days, 18, hours, for, all, the, proportion, is, greater, than, double, thus, greater, than, of, the, distances, 3, 5, 8, 13, or, 14, although, less, than, of, the, squares, which, double, the, proportions, of, the, distances, namely, 9, 25, 64, 169, or, 196, just, as, 3, 2, is, also, greater, than, 1, but, less, than, 2
