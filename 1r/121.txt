expressive, line, and, thick, application, of, paint, inspired, avant, garde, artistic, groups, like, the, fauves, and, german, expressionists, in, the, early, 20th, century, van, gogh, s, work,

letters, a, few, appeared, in, 1906, and, 1913, the, majority, were, published, in, 1914, vincent, s, letters, are, eloquent, and, expressive, have, been, described, as, having, a, diary, like, intimacy, and, read, in, parts, like, autobiography, translator, arnold, pomerans, wrote, that, their, publication, adds, a, fresh, dimension, to, the, understanding, of, van, gogh, s, artistic,

long, as, i, can, keep, my, hand, in, the, flame, he, did, not, recall, the, event, well, but, later, assumed, that, his, uncle, had, blown, out, the, flame, kee, s, father, made, it, clear, that, her, refusal, should, be, heeded, and, that, the, two, would, not, marry, largely, because, of, van, gogh, s, inability, to, support, himself, mauve, took, van, gogh, on, as, a, student, and,

for, the, hague, in, january, 1882, mauve, introduced, him, to, painting, in, oil, and, lent, him, money, to, set, up, a, studio, within, a, month, van, gogh, and, mauve, fell, out, possibly, over, the, viability, of, drawing, from, plaster, casts, van, gogh, could, afford, to, hire, only, people, from, the, street, as, models, a, practice, of, which, mauve, seems, to, have, disapproved, in, june, van, gogh, suffered, a, bout, of, gonorrhoea, and, spent, three, weeks, in, hospital, soon, after, he, first, painted, in, oils, bought, with, money, borrowed, from, theo, he, liked, the, medium, and, he, spread, the, paint, liberally, scraping, from, the, canvas, and, working, back, with, the, brush, he, wrote, that, he, was, surprised, at, how, good, the, results, were, by, march,

discovered, the, details, of, their, relationship, he, put, pressure, on, his, son, to, abandon, sien, and, her, two, children, vincent, at, first, defied, him, and, considered, moving, the, family, out, of, the, city, but, in, late, 1883, he, left, sien, and, the, children, poverty, may, have, pushed, sien, back, into, prostitution, the, home, became, less, happy, and, van, gogh, may, have, felt, family, life, was, irreconcilable, with, his, artistic, development, sien, gave, her, daughter, to, her, mother, and, baby, willem, to, her, brother, willem, remembered, visiting, rotterdam, when, he, was, about, 12, when, an, uncle, tried, to, persuade, sien, to, marry, to, legitimise, the, child, he, believed, van, gogh, was, his, father, but, the, timing, of, his, birth, makes, this,

distinguished, his, later, work, there, was, interest, from, a, dealer, in, paris, early, in, 1885, theo, asked, vincent, if, he, had, paintings, ready, to, exhibit, in, may, van, gogh, responded, with, his, first, major, work, the, potato, eaters, and, a, series, of, peasant, character, studies, which, were, the, culmination, of, several, years, of, work, when, he, complained, that, theo, was, not, making, enough, effort, to, sell, his, paintings, in, paris, his, brother, responded, that, they, were, too, dark, and, not, in, keeping, with, the, bright, style, of, impressionism, in, august, his, work, was, publicly, exhibited, for, the, first, time, in, the, shop, windows, of, the, dealer, leurs, in, the, hague, one, of, his, young, peasant, sitters, became, pregnant, in, september,

teeth, became, loose, and, painful, in, antwerp, he, applied, himself, to, the, study, of, colour, theory, and, spent, time, in, museums, particularly, studying, the, work, of, peter, paul, rubens, and, broadened, his, palette, to, include, carmine, cobalt, blue, and, emerald, green, van, gogh, bought, japanese, ukiyo, e, woodcuts, in, the, docklands, later, incorporating, elements, of, their, style, into, the, background, of, some, of, his, paintings, he, was, drinking, heavily, again, and, was, hospitalised, between, february, and, march, 1886, when, he, was, possibly, also, treated, for, syphilis, after, his, recovery, despite, his, antipathy, towards, academic, teaching, he, took, the, higher, level, admission, exams, at, the, academy, of, fine, arts, in, antwerp, and, in, january,

at, the, antwerp, academy, on, 18, january, 1886, he, quickly, got, into, trouble, with, charles, verlat, the, director, of, the, academy, and, teacher, of, a, painting, class, because, of, his, unconventional, painting, style, van, gogh, had, also, clashed, with, the, instructor, of, the, drawing, class, franz, vinck, van, gogh, finally, started, to, attend, the, drawing, classes, after, antique, plaster, models, given, by, eug, ne, siberdt, soon, siberdt, and, van, gogh, came, into, conflict, when, the, latter, did, not, comply, with, siberdt, s, requirement, that, drawings, express, the, contour, and, concentrate, on, the, line, when, van, gogh, was, required, to, draw, the, venus, de, milo, during, a, drawing, class, he, produced, the, limbless, naked, torso, of, a, flemish, peasant, woman, siberdt, regarded, this, as, defiance, against, his, artistic, guidance, and, made, corrections, to, van, gogh, s, drawing, with, his, crayon, so, vigorously, that, he, tore, the, paper, van, gogh, then, flew, into, a, violent, rage, and, shouted, at, siberdt, you, clearly, do, not, know, what, a, young, woman, is, like, god, damn, it, a, woman, must, have, hips, buttocks, a, pelvis, in, which, she, can, carry, a, baby, according, to, some, accounts, this, was, the, last, time, van, gogh, attended, classes, at, the, academy, and, he, left, later, for, paris, on, 31, march, 1886, which, was, about, a, month, after, the, confrontation, with, siberdt, the, teachers, of, the, academy, decided, that, 17, students, including, van, gogh, had, to, repeat, a, year, the, story, that, van, gogh, was, expelled, from, the, academy, by, siberdt, is, therefore, unfounded, van, gogh, moved, to, paris, in, march, 1886, where, he, shared, theo, s, rue, laval, apartment, in,

woodblock, prints, and, had, used, them, to, decorate, the, walls, of, his, studio, while, in, paris, he, collected, hundreds, of, them, he, tried, his, hand, at, japonaiserie, tracing, a, figure, from, a, reproduction, on, the, cover, of, the, magazine, paris, illustre, the, courtesan, or, oiran, 1887, after, keisai, eisen, which, he, then, graphically, enlarged, in, a, painting, after, seeing, the, portrait, of, adolphe, monticelli, at, the, galerie, delareybarette, van, gogh, adopted, a, brighter, palette, and, a, bolder, attack, particularly, in, paintings, such, as, his, seascape, at, saintes, maries, 1888, two, years, later, vincent, and, theo, paid, for, the, publication, of, a, book, on, monticelli, paintings, and, vincent, bought, some, of, monticelli, s, works, to, add, to, his, collection, van, gogh, learned, about, fernand, cormon, s, atelier, from, theo, he, worked, at, the, studio, in, april, and, may, 1886, where, he, frequented, the, circle, of, the, australian, artist, john, russell, who, painted, his, portrait, in, 1886, van, gogh, also, met, fellow, students, mile, bernard, louis, anquetin, and, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, who, painted, a, portrait, of, him, in, pastel, they, met, at, julien, p, re, tanguy, s, paint, shop, which, was, at, that, time, the, only, place, where, paul, c, zanne, s, paintings, were, displayed, in, 1886, two, large, exhibitions, were, staged, there, showing, pointillism, and, neo, impressionism, for, the, first, time, and, bringing, attention, to, georges, seurat, and, paul, signac, theo, kept, a, stock, of, impressionist, paintings, in, his, gallery, on, boulevard, montmartre, but, van, gogh, was, slow, to, acknowledge, the, new, developments, in, art, conflicts, arose, between, the, brothers, at, the, end, of, 1886, theo, found, living, with, vincent, to, be, almost, unbearable, by, early, 1887, they, were, again, at, peace, and, vincent, had, moved, to, asni, res, a, northwestern, suburb, of, paris, where, he, got, to, know, signac, he, adopted, elements, of, pointillism, a, technique, in, which, a, multitude, of, small, coloured, dots, are, applied, to, the, canvas, so, that, when, seen, from, a, distance, they, create, an, optical, blend, of, hues, the, style, stresses, the, ability, of, complementary, colours, including, blue, and, orange, to, form, vibrant, contrasts, while, in, asni, res, van, gogh, painted, parks, restaurants, and, the, seine, including, bridges, across, the, seine, at, asni, res, in, november, 1887, theo, and, vincent, befriended, paul, gauguin, who, had, just, arrived, in, paris, towards, the, end, of, the, year, vincent, arranged, an, exhibition, alongside, bernard, anquetin, and, probably, toulouse, lautrec, at, the, grand, bouillon, restaurant, du, chalet, 43, avenue, de, clichy, montmartre, in, a, contemporary, account, bernard, wrote, that, the, exhibition, was, ahead, of, anything, else, in, paris, there, bernard, and, anquetin, sold, their, first, paintings, and, van, gogh, exchanged, work, with, gauguin, discussions, on, art, artists, and, their, social, situations, started, during, this, exhibition, continued, and, expanded, to, include, visitors, to, the, show, like, camille, pissarro, and, his, son, lucien, signac, and, seurat, in, february, 1888, feeling, worn, out, from, life, in, paris, van, gogh, left, having, painted, more, than, 200, paintings, during, his, two, years, there, hours, before, his, departure, accompanied, by, theo, he, paid, his, first, and, only, visit, to, seurat, in, his, studio, ill, from, drink, and, suffering, from, smoker, s, cough, in, february, 1888, van, gogh, sought, refuge, in, arles, he, seems, to, have, moved, with, thoughts, of, founding, an, art, colony, the, danish, artist, christian, mourier, petersen, was, his, companion, for, two, months, and, at, first, arles, appeared, exotic, to, van, gogh, in, a, letter, he, described, it, as, a, foreign, country, the, zouaves, the, brothels, the, adorable, little, arl, sienne, going, to, her, first, communion, the, priest, in, his, surplice, who, looks, like, a, dangerous, rhinoceros, the, people, drinking, absinthe, all, seem, to, me, creatures, from, another, world, the, time, in, arles, was, one, of, van, gogh, s, more, prolific, periods, he, completed, 200, paintings, and, more, than, 100, drawings, and, watercolors, he, was, energized, by, the, local, countryside, and, light, his, works, from, this, period, are, rich, in, yellow, ultramarine, and, mauve, they, include, harvests, wheat, fields, and, general, rural, landmarks, from, the, area, including, the, old, mill, 1888, one, of, seven, canvases, sent, to, pont, aven, on, 4, october, 1888, in, an, exchange, of, works, with, paul, gauguin, mile, bernard, charles, laval, and, others, in, march, 1888, vvan, gogh, created, landscapes, using, a, gridded, perspective, frame, and, three, of, those, works, were, shown, at, the, annual, exhibition, of, the, soci, t, des, artistes, ind, pendants, in, april, he, was, visited, by, the, american, artist, dodge, macknight, who, was, living, nearby, at, fontvieille, on, 1, may, 1888, van, gogh, signed, a, lease, for, four, rooms, in, the, yellow, house, the, house, at, 2, place, lamartine, cost, 15, francs, per, month, the, rooms, were, unfurnished, and, had, been, uninhabited, for, months, because, the, yellow, house, had, to, be, furnished, before, he, could, fully, move, in, van, gogh, moved, from, the, h, tel, carrel, to, the, caf, de, la, gare, on, 7, may, 1888, he, had, befriended, the, yellow, house, s, proprietors, joseph, and, marie, ginoux, and, was, able, to, use, it, as, a, studio, van, gogh, wanted, a, gallery, to, display, his, work, and, started, a, series, of, paintings, that, eventually, included, van, gogh, s, chair, 1888, bedroom, in, arles, 1888, the, night, caf, 1888, caf, terrace, at, night, september, 1888, starry, night, over, the, rhone, 1888, and, still, life, vase, with, twelve, sunflowers, 1888, all, intended, for, the, decoration, for, the, yellow, house, van, gogh, wrote, that, with, the, night, caf, he, tried, to, express, the, idea, that, the, caf, is, a, place, where, one, can, ruin, oneself, go, mad, or, commit, a, crime, when, he, visited, saintes, maries, de, la, mer, in, june, he, gave, lessons, to, a, zouave, second, lieutenant, paul, eug, ne, milliet, and, painted, boats, on, the, sea, and, the, village, macknight, introduced, van, gogh, to, eug, ne, boch, a, belgian, painter, who, sometimes, stayed, in, fontvieille, and, the, two, exchanged, visits, in, july, when, gauguin, agreed, to, visit, arles, in, 1888, van, gogh, hoped, for, friendship, and, to, realize, his, idea, of, an, artists, collective, van, gogh, prepared, for, gauguin, s, arrival, by, painting, four, versions, of, sunflowers, in, one, week, in, the, hope, of, living, in, a, studio, of, our, own, with, gauguin, he, wrote, in, a, letter, to, theo, i, d, like, to, do, a, decoration, for, the, studio, nothing, but, large, sunflowers, when, boch, visited, again, van, gogh, painted, a, portrait, of, him, as, well, as, the, study, the, poet, against, a, starry, sky, in, preparation, for, gauguin, s, visit, van, gogh, bought, two, beds, on, advice, from, the, station, s, postal, supervisor, joseph, roulin, whose, portrait, he, painted, on, 17, september, he, spent, his, first, night, in, the, still, sparsely, furnished, yellow, house, when, gauguin, consented, to, work, and, live, in, arles, with, him, van, gogh, started, to, work, on, the, d, coration, for, the, yellow, house, probably, the, most, ambitious, effort, he, ever, undertook, he, completed, two, chair, paintings, van, gogh, s, chair, and, gauguin, s, chair, after, much, pleading, from, van, gogh, gauguin, arrived, in, arles, on, 23, october, and, in, november, the, two, painted, together, gauguin, depicted, van, gogh, in, his, the, painter, of, sunflowers, van, gogh, painted, pictures, from, memory, following, gauguin, s, suggestion, among, these, imaginative, paintings, is, memory, of, the, garden, at, etten, their, first, joint, outdoor, venture, was, at, the, alyscamps, when, they, produced, the, pendants, les, alyscamps, the, single, painting, gauguin, completed, during, his, visit, was, his, portrait, of, van, gogh, van, gogh, and, gauguin, visited, montpellier, in, december, 1888, where, they, saw, works, by, courbet, and, delacroix, in, the, mus, e, fabre, their, relationship, began, to, deteriorate, van, gogh, admired, gauguin, and, wanted, to, be, treated, as, his, equal, but, gauguin, was, arrogant, and, domineering, which, frustrated, van, gogh, they, often, quarreled, van, gogh, increasingly, feared, that, gauguin, was, going, to, desert, him, and, the, situation, which, van, gogh, described, as, one, of, excessive, tension, rapidly, headed, towards, crisis, point, the, exact, sequence, that, led, to, the, mutilation, of, van, gogh, s, ear, is, not, known, gauguin, said, fifteen, years, later, that, the, night, followed, several, instances, of, physically, threatening, behaviour, their, relationship, was, complex, and, theo, may, have, owed, money, to, gauguin, who, suspected, the, brothers, were, exploiting, him, financially, it, seems, likely, that, vincent, realised, that, gauguin, was, planning, to, leave, the, following, days, saw, heavy, rain, leading, to, the, two, men, being, shut, in, the, yellow, house, gauguin, recalled, that, van, gogh, followed, him, after, he, left, for, a, walk, and, rushed, towards, me, an, open, razor, in, his, hand, this, account, is, uncorroborated, gauguin, was, almost, certainly, absent, from, the, yellow, house, that, night, most, likely, staying, in, a, hotel, after, an, altercation, on, the, evening, of, 23, december, 1888, van, gogh, returned, to, his, room, where, he, seemingly, heard, voices, and, either, wholly, or, in, part, severed, his, left, ear, with, a, razor, causing, severe, bleeding, he, bandaged, the, wound, wrapped, the, ear, in, paper, and, delivered, the, package, to, a, woman, at, a, brothel, van, gogh, and, gauguin, both, frequented, van, gogh, was, found, unconscious, the, next, morning, by, a, policeman, and, taken, to, hospital, where, he, was, treated, by, f, lix, rey, a, young, doctor, still, in, training, the, ear, was, brought, to, the, hospital, but, rey, did, not, attempt, to, reattach, it, as, too, much, time, had, passed, van, gogh, researcher, and, art, historian, bernadette, murphy, discovered, the, true, identity, of, the, woman, named, gabrielle, berlatier, who, died, in, arles, at, the, age, of, 80, in, 1952, and, whose, descendants, still, lived, as, of, 2020, just, outside, arles, gabrielle, known, in, her, youth, as, gaby, was, a, 17, year, old, cleaning, girl, at, the, brothel, and, other, local, establishments, at, the, time, van, gogh, presented, her, with, his, ear, van, gogh, had, no, recollection, of, the, event, suggesting, that, he, may, have, suffered, an, acute, mental, breakdown, the, hospital, diagnosis, was, acute, mania, with, generalised, delirium, and, within, a, few, days, the, local, police, ordered, that, he, be, placed, in, hospital, care, gauguin, immediately, notified, theo, who, on, 24, december, had, proposed, marriage, to, his, old, friend, andries, bonger, s, sister, johanna, that, evening, theo, rushed, to, the, station, to, board, a, night, train, to, arles, he, arrived, on, christmas, day, and, comforted, vincent, who, seemed, to, be, semi, lucid, that, evening, he, left, arles, for, the, return, trip, to, paris, during, the, first, days, of, his, treatment, van, gogh, repeatedly, and, unsuccessfully, asked, for, gauguin, who, asked, a, policeman, attending, the, case, to, be, kind, enough, monsieur, to, awaken, this, man, with, great, care, and, if, he, asks, for, me, tell, him, i, have, left, for, paris, the, sight, of, me, might, prove, fatal, for, him, gauguin, fled, arles, never, to, see, van, gogh, again, they, continued, to, correspond, and, in, 1890, gauguin, proposed, they, form, a, studio, in, antwerp, meanwhile, other, visitors, to, the, hospital, included, marie, ginoux, and, roulin, despite, a, pessimistic, diagnosis, van, gogh, recovered, and, returned, to, the, yellow, house, on, 7, january, 1889, he, spent, the, following, month, between, hospital, and, home, suffering, from, hallucinations, and, delusions, of, poisoning, in, march, the, police, closed, his, house,

twice, in, march, in, april, van, gogh, moved, into, rooms, owned, by, dr, rey, after, floods, damaged, paintings, in, his, own, home, two, months, later, he, left, arles, and, voluntarily, entered, an, asylum, in, saint, r, my, de, provence, around, this, time, he, wrote, sometimes, moods, of, indescribable, anguish, sometimes, moments, when, the, veil, of, time, and, fatality, of, circumstances, seemed, to, be, torn, apart, for, an, instant, van, gogh, gave, his, 1889, portrait, of, doctor, f, lix, rey, to, dr, rey, the, physician, was, not, fond, of, the, painting, and, used, it, to, repair, a, chicken, coop, then, gave, it, away, in, 2016, the, portrait, was, housed, at, the, pushkin, museum, of, fine, arts, and, estimated, to, be, worth, over, 50, million, van, gogh, entered, the, saint, paul, de, mausole, asylum, on, 8, may, 1889, accompanied, by, his, caregiver, fr, d, ric, salles, a, protestant, clergyman, saint, paul, was, a, former, monastery, in, saint, r,

he, used, as, a, studio, the, clinic, and, its, garden, became, the, main, subjects, of, his, paintings, he, made, several, studies, of, the, hospital, s, interiors, such, as, vestibule, of, the, asylum, and, saint, r, my, september, 1889, and, its, gardens, such, as, lilacs, may, 1889, some, of, his, works, from, this, time, are, characterised, by, swirls, such, as, the, starry, night, he, was, allowed, short, supervised, walks, during, which, time, he, painted, cypresses, and, olive, trees, including, valley, with, ploughman, seen, from, above, olive, trees, with, the, alpilles, in, the, background, 1889, cypresses, 1889, cornfield, with, cypresses, 1889, country, road, in, provence, by, night, 1890, in, september, 1889, he, produced, two, further, versions, of, bedroom, in, arles, and, the, gardener, limited, access, to, life, outside, the, clinic, resulted, in, a, shortage, of, subject, matter, van, gogh, instead, worked, on, interpretations, of, other, artist, s, paintings, such, as, millet, s, the, sower, and, noonday, rest, and, variations, on, his, own, earlier, work, van, gogh, was, an, admirer, of, the, realism, of, jules, breton, gustave, courbet, and,

and, april, 1890, van, gogh, suffered, a, severe, relapse, depressed, and, unable, to, bring, himself, to, write, he, was, still, able, to, paint, and, draw, a, little, during, this, time, and, he, later, wrote, to, theo, that, he, had, made, a, few, small, canvases, from, memory, reminisces, of, the, north, among, these, was, two, peasant, women, digging, in, a, snow, covered, field, at, sunset, hulsker, believes, that, this, small, group, of, paintings, formed, the, nucleus, of, many, drawings, and, study, sheets, depicting, landscapes, and, figures, that, van, gogh, worked, on, during, this, time, he, comments, that, this, short, period, was, the, only, time, that, van, gogh, s, illness, had, a, significant, effect, on, his, work, van, gogh, asked, his, mother, and, his, brother, to, send, him, drawings, and, rough, work, he, had, done, in, the, early, 1880s, so, he, could, work, on, new, paintings, from, his, old, sketches, belonging, to, this, period, is, sorrowing,

recommended, him, van, gogh, s, first, impression, was, that, gachet, was, iller, than, i, am, it, seemed, to, me, or, let, s, say, just, as, much, the, painter, charles, daubigny, moved, to, auvers, in, 1861, and, in, turn, drew, other, artists, there, including, camille, corot, and, honor, daumier, in, july, 1890, van, gogh, completed, two, paintings, of, daubigny, s, garden, one, of, which, is, likely, his, final, work, during, his, last, weeks, at, saint, r, my, his, thoughts, returned, to, memories, of, the, north, and, several, of, the, approximately, 70, oils, painted, during, as, many, days, in, auvers, sur, oise, are, reminiscent, of, northern, scenes, in, june, 1890, he, painted, several, portraits, of, his, doctor, including, portrait, of, dr, gachet, and, his, only, etching, in, each, the, emphasis, is, on, gachet, s, melancholic, disposition, there, are, other, paintings, which, are, probably, unfinished, including, thatched, cottages, by, a, hill, in, july, van, gogh, wrote, that, he, had, become, absorbed, in, the, immense, plain, against, the, hills, boundless, as, the, sea, delicate, yellow, he, had, first, become, captivated, by, the, fields, in, may, when, the, wheat, was, young, and, green, in, july, he, described, to, theo, vast, fields, of, wheat, under, turbulent, skies, he, wrote, that, they, represented, his, sadness, and, extreme, loneliness, and, that, the, canvases, will, tell, you, what, i, cannot, say, in, words, that, is, how, healthy, and, invigorating, i, find, the, countryside, wheatfield, with, crows, although, not, his, last, oil, work, is, from, july, 1890, and, hulsker, discusses, it, as, being, associated, with, melancholy, and, extreme, loneliness, hulsker, identifies, seven, oil, paintings, from, auvers, that, follow, the, completion, of, wheatfield, with, crows, hulsker, also, expressed, concern, about, the, number, of, paintings, attributed, to, van, gogh, from, the, period, on, 27, july, 1890, sunday, aged, 37, van, gogh, shot, himself, in, the, chest, with, a, revolver, the, shooting, may, have, taken, place, in, the, wheat, field, in, which, he, had, been, painting, or, in, a, local, barn, the, bullet, was, deflected, by, a, rib, and, passed, through, his, chest, without, doing, apparent, damage, to, internal, organs, possibly, stopped, by, his, spine, he, was, able, to, walk, back, to, the, auberge, ravoux, where, he, was, attended, to, by, two, doctors, one, of, them, dr, gachet, served, as, a, war, surgeon, in, 1870, and, had, extensive, knowledge, of, gunshots, vincent, was, possibly, attended, to, during, the, night, by, dr, gachet, s, son, paul, louis, gachet, and, the, innkeeper, arthur, ravoux, the, following, morning, theo, rushed, to, his, brother, s, side, finding, him, in, good, spirits, but, within, hours, vincent, s, health, began, to, fail, suffering, from, an, infection, resulting, from, the, wound, he, died, in, the, early, hours, of, tuesday, 29, july, according, to, theo, vincent, s, last, words, were, the, sadness, will, last, forever, van, gogh, was, buried, on, 30, july, in, the, municipal, cemetery, of, auvers, sur, oise, the, funeral, was, attended, by, theo, van, gogh, andries, bonger, charles, laval, lucien, pissarro, mile, bernard, julien, tanguy, and, paul, gachet, among, twenty, family, members, friends, and, locals, theo, suffered, from, syphilis, and, his, health, began, to, decline, further, after, his, brother, s, death, weak, and, unable, to, come, to, terms, with, vincent, s, absence, he, died, on, 25, january, 1891, at, den, dolder, and, was, buried, in, utrecht, in, 1914, johanna, van, gogh, bonger, had, theo, s, body, exhumed, and, moved, from, utrecht, to, be, re, buried, alongside, vincent, s, at, auvers, sur, oise, there, have, been, numerous, debates, as, to, the, nature, of, van, gogh, s, illness, and, its, effect, on, his, work, and, many, retrospective, diagnoses, have, been, proposed, the, consensus, is, that, van, gogh, had, an, episodic, condition, with, periods, of, normal, functioning, perry, was, the, first, to, suggest, bipolar, disorder, in, 1947, and, this, has, been, supported, by, the, psychiatrists, hemphill, and, blumer, biochemist, wilfred, arnold, has, countered, that, the, symptoms, are, more, consistent, with, acute, intermittent, porphyria, noting, that, the, popular, link, between, bipolar, disorder, and, creativity, might, be, spurious, temporal, lobe, epilepsy, with, bouts, of, depression, has, also, been, suggested, whatever, the, diagnosis, his, condition, was, likely, worsened, by, malnutrition, overwork, insomnia, and, alcohol, van, gogh, drew, and, painted, with, watercolours, while, at, school, but, only, a, few, examples, survive, and, the, authorship, of, some, has, been, challenged, when, he, took, up, art, as, an, adult, he, began, at, an, elementary, level, in, early, 1882, his, uncle, cornelis, marinus, owner, of, a, well, known, gallery, of, contemporary, art, in, amsterdam, asked, for, drawings, of, the, hague, van, gogh, s, work, did, not, live, up, to, expectations, marinus, offered, a, second, commission, specifying, the, subject, matter, in, detail, but, was, again, disappointed, with, the, result, van, gogh, persevered, he, experimented, with, lighting, in, his, studio, using, variable, shutters, and, different, drawing, materials, for, more, than, a, year, he, worked, on, single, figures, highly, elaborate, studies, in, black, and, white, which, at, the, time, gained, him, only, criticism, later, they, were, recognised, as, early, masterpieces, in, august, 1882, theo, gave, vincent, money, to, buy, materials, for, working, en, plein, air, vincent, wrote, that, he, could, now, go, on, painting, with, new, vigour, from, early, 1883, he, worked, on, multi, figure, compositions, he, had, some, of, them, photographed, but, when, his, brother, remarked, that, they, lacked, liveliness, and, freshness, he, destroyed, them, and, turned, to, oil, painting, van, gogh, turned, to, well, known, hague, school, artists, like, weissenbruch, and, blommers, and, he, received, technical, advice, from, them, as, well, as, from, painters, like, de, bock, and, van, der, weele, both, of, the, hague, school, s, second, generation, he, moved, to, nuenen, after, a, short, period, of, time, in, drenthe, and, began, work, on, several, large, paintings, but, destroyed, most, of, them, the, potato, eaters, and, its, companion, pieces, are, the, only, ones, to, have, survived, following, a, visit, to, the, rijksmuseum, van, gogh, wrote, of, his, admiration, for, the, quick, economical, brushwork, of, the, dutch, masters, especially, rembrandt, and, frans, hals, he, was, aware, many, of, his, faults, were, due, to, lack, of, experience, and, technical, expertise, so, in, november, 1885, he, travelled, to, antwerp, and, later, paris, to, learn, and, develop, his, skills, theo, criticised, the, potato, eaters, for, its, dark, palette, which, he, thought, unsuitable, for, a, modern, style, during, van, gogh, s, stay, in, paris, between, 1886, and, 1887, he, tried, to, master, a, new, lighter, palette, his, portrait, of, p, re, tanguy, 1887, shows, his, success, with, the, brighter, palette, and, is, evidence, of, an, evolving, personal, style, charles, blanc, s, treatise, on, colour, interested, him, greatly, and, led, him, to, work, with, complementary, colours, van, gogh, came, to, believe, that, the, effect, of, colour, went, beyond, the, descriptive, he, said, that, colour, expresses, something, in, itself, according, to, hughes, van, gogh, perceived, colour, as, having, a, psychological, and, moral, weight, as, exemplified, in, the, garish, reds, and, greens, of, the, night, caf, a, work, he, wanted, to, express, the, terrible, passions, of, humanity, yellow, meant, the, most, to, him, because, it, symbolised, emotional, truth, he, used, yellow, as, a, symbol, for, sunlight, life, and, god, van, gogh, strove, to, be, a, painter, of, rural, life, and, nature, during, his, first, summer, in, arles, he, used, his, new, palette, to, paint, landscapes, and, traditional, rural, life, his, belief, that, a, power, existed, behind, the, natural, led, him, to, try, to, capture, a, sense, of, that, power, or, the, essence, of, nature, in, his, art, sometimes, through, the, use, of, symbols, his, renditions, of, the, sower, at, first, copied, from, jean, fran, ois, millet, reflect, the, influence, of, thomas, carlyle, and, friedrich, nietzsche, s, thoughts, on, the, heroism, of, physical, labour, as, well, as, van, gogh, s, religious, beliefs, the, sower, as, christ, sowing, life, beneath, the, hot, sun, these, were, themes, and, motifs, he, returned, to, often, to, rework, and, develop, his, paintings, of, flowers, are, filled, with, symbolism, but, rather, than, use, traditional, christian, iconography, he, made, up, his, own, where, life, is, lived, under, the, sun, and, work, is, an, allegory, of, life, in, arles, having, gained, confidence, after, painting, spring, blossoms, and, learning, to, capture, bright, sunlight, he, was, ready, to, paint, the, sower, van, gogh, stayed, within, what, he, called, the, guise, of, reality, and, was, critical, of, overly, stylised, works, he, wrote, afterwards, that, the, abstraction, of, starry, night, had, gone, too, far, and, that, reality, had, receded, too, far, in, the, background, hughes, describes, it, as, a, moment, of, extreme, visionary, ecstasy, the, stars, are, in, a, great, whirl, reminiscent, of, hokusai, s, great, wave, the, movement, in, the, heaven, above, is, reflected, by, the, movement, of, the, cypress, on, the, earth, below, and, the, painter, s, vision, is, translated, into, a, thick, emphatic, plasma, of, paint, between, 1885, and, his, death, in, 1890, van, gogh, appears, to, have, been, building, an, oeuvre, a, collection, that, reflected, his, personal, vision, and, could, be, commercially, successful, he, was, influenced, by, blanc, s, definition, of, style, that, a, true, painting, required, optimal, use, of, colour, perspective, and, brushstrokes, van, gogh, applied, the, word, purposeful, to, paintings, he, thought, he, had, mastered, as, opposed, to, those, he, thought, of, as, studies, he, painted, many, series, of, studies, most, of, which, were, still, lifes, many, executed, as, colour, experiments, or, as, gifts, to, friends, the, work, in, arles, contributed, considerably, to, his, oeuvre, those, he, thought, the, most, important, from, that, time, were, the, sower, night, cafe, memory, of, the, garden, in, etten, and, starry, night, with, their, broad, brushstrokes, inventive, perspectives, colours, contours, and, designs, these, paintings, represent, the, style, he, sought, van, gogh, s, stylistic, developments, are, usually, linked, to, the, periods, he, spent, living, in, different, places, across, europe, he, was, inclined, to, immerse, himself, in, local, cultures, and, lighting, conditions, although, he, maintained, a, highly, individual, visual, outlook, throughout, his, evolution, as, an, artist, was, slow, and, he, was, aware, of, his, painterly, limitations, van, gogh, moved, home, often, perhaps, to, expose, himself, to, new, visual, stimuli, and, through, exposure, develop, his, technical, skill, art, historian, melissa, mcquillan, believes, the, moves, also, reflect, later, stylistic, changes, and, that, van, gogh, used, the, moves, to, avoid, conflict, and, as, a, coping, mechanism, for, when, the, idealistic, artist, was, faced, with, the, realities, of, his, then, current, situation, van, gogh, said, portraiture, was, his, greatest, interest, what, i, m, most, passionate, about, much, much, more, than, all, the, rest, in, my, profession, he, wrote, in, 1890, is, the, portrait, the, modern, portrait, it, is, the, only, thing, in, painting, that, moves, me, deeply, and, that, gives, me, a, sense, of, the, infinite, he, wrote, to, his, sister, that, he, wished, to, paint, portraits, that, would, endure, and, that, he, would, use, colour, to, capture, their, emotions, and, character, rather, than, aiming, for, photographic, realism, those, closest, to, van, gogh, are, mostly, absent, from, his, portraits, he, rarely, painted, theo, van, rappard, or, bernard, the, portraits, of, his, mother, were, from, photographs, van, gogh, painted, arles, postmaster, joseph, roulin, and, his, family, repeatedly, in, five, versions, of, la, berceuse, the, lullaby, van, gogh, painted, augustine, roulin, quietly, holding, a, rope, that, rocks, the, unseen, cradle, of, her, infant, daughter, van, gogh, had, planned, for, it, to, be, the, central, image, of, a, triptych, flanked, by, paintings, of, sunflowers, van, gogh, created, more, than, 43, self, portraits, between, 1885, and, 1889, they, were, usually, completed, in, series, such, as, those, painted, in, paris, in, mid, 1887, and, continued, until, shortly, before, his, death, generally, the, portraits, were, studies, created, during, periods, when, he, was, reluctant, to, mix, with, others, or, when, he, lacked, models, and, painted, himself, van, gogh, s, self, portraits, reflect, a, high, degree, of, self, scrutiny, often, they, were, intended, to, mark, important, periods, in, his, life, for, example, the, mid, 1887, paris, series, were, painted, at, the, point, where, he, became, aware, of, claude, monet, paul, c, zanne, and, signac, in, self, portrait, with, grey, felt, hat, heavy, strains, of, paint, spread, outwards, across, the, canvas, it, is, one, of, his, most, renowned, self, portraits, of, that, period, with, its, highly, organized, rhythmic, brushstrokes, and, the, novel, halo, derived, from, the, neo, impressionist, repertoire, was, what, van, gogh, himself, called, a, purposeful, canvas, they, contain, a, wide, array, of, physiognomical, representations, van, gogh, s, mental, and, physical, condition, is, usually, apparent, he, may, appear, unkempt, unshaven, or, with, a, neglected, beard, with, deeply, sunken, eyes, a, weak, jaw, or, having, lost, teeth, some, show, him, with, full, lips, a, long, face, or, prominent, skull, or, sharpened, alert, features, his, hair, is, sometimes, depicted, in, a, vibrant, reddish, hue, and, at, other, times, ash, colored, van, gogh, s, self, portraits, vary, stylistically, in, those, painted, after, december, 1888, the, strong, contrast, of, vivid, colors, highlight, the, haggard, pallor, of, his, skin, some, depict, the, artist, with, a, beard, others, without, he, can, be, seen, with, bandages, in, portraits, executed, just, after, he, mutilated, his, ear, in, only, a, few, does, he, depict, himself, as, a, painter, those, painted, in, saint, r, my, show, the, head, from, the, right, the, side, opposite, his, damaged, ear, as, he, painted, himself, reflected, in, his, mirror, van, gogh, painted, several, landscapes, with, flowers, including, roses, lilacs, irises, and, sunflowers, some, reflect, his, interests, in, the, language, of, colour, and, also, in, japanese, ukiyo, e, there, are, two, series, of, dying, sunflowers, the, first, was, painted, in, paris, in, 1887, and, shows, flowers, lying, on, the, ground, the, second, set, was, completed, a, year, later, in, arles, and, is, of, bouquets, in, a, vase, positioned, in, early, morning, light, both, are, built, from, thickly, layered, paintwork, which, according, to, the, london, national, gallery, evoke, the, texture, of, the, seed, heads, in, these, series, van, gogh, was, not, preoccupied, by, his, usual, interest, in, filling, his, paintings, with, subjectivity, and, emotion, rather, the, two, series, are, intended, to, display, his, technical, skill, and, working, methods, to, gauguin, who, was, about, to, visit, the, 1888, paintings, were, created, during, a, rare, period, of, optimism, for, the, artist, vincent, wrote, to, theo, in, august, 1888, i, m, painting, with, the, gusto, of, a, marseillais, eating, bouillabaisse, which, won, t, surprise, you, when, it, s, a, question, of, painting, large, sunflowers, if, i, carry, out, this, plan, there, ll, be, a, dozen, or, so, panels, the, whole, thing, will, therefore, be, a, symphony, in, blue, and, yellow, i, work, on, it, all, these, mornings, from, sunrise, because, the, flowers, wilt, quickly, and, it, s, a, matter, of, doing, the, whole, thing, in, one, go, the, sunflowers, were, painted, to, decorate, the, walls, in, anticipation, of, gauguin, s, visit, and, van, gogh, placed, individual, works, around, the, yellow, house, s, guest, room, in, arles, gauguin, was, deeply, impressed, and, later, acquired, two, of, the, paris, versions, after, gauguin, s, departure, van, gogh, imagined, the, two, major, versions, of, the, sunflowers, as, wings, of, the, berceuse, triptych, and, included, them, in, his, les, xx, in, brussels, exhibit, today, the, major, pieces, of, the, series, are, among, his, best, known, celebrated, for, the, sickly, connotations, of, the, colour, yellow, and, its, tie, in, with, the, yellow, house, the, expressionism, of, the, brush, strokes, and, their, contrast, against, often, dark, backgrounds, fifteen, canvases, depict, cypresses, a, tree, he, became, fascinated, with, in, arles, he, brought, life, to, the, trees, which, were, traditionally, seen, as, emblematic, of, death, the, series, of, cypresses, he, began, in, arles, featured, the, trees, in, the, distance, as, windbreaks, in, fields, when, he, was, at, saint, r, my, he, brought, them, to, the, foreground, vincent, wrote, to, theo, in, may, 1889, cypresses, still, preoccupy, me, i, should, like, to, do, something, with, them, like, my, canvases, of, sunflowers, he, went, on, to, say, they, are, beautiful, in, line, and, proportion, like, an, egyptian, obelisk, in, mid, 1889, and, at, his, sister, wil, s, request, van, gogh, painted, several, smaller, versions, of, wheat, field, with, cypresses, the, works, are, characterised, by, swirls, and, densely, painted, impasto, and, include, the, starry, night, in, which, cypresses, dominate, the, foreground, in, addition, to, this, other, notable, works, on, cypresses, include, cypresses, 1889, cypresses, with, two, figures, 1889, 90, and, road, with, cypress, and, star, 1890, during, the, last, six, or, seven, months, of, the, year, 1889, he, had, also, created, at, least, fifteen, paintings, of, olive, trees, a, subject, which, he, considered, as, demanding, and, compelling, among, these, works, are, olive, trees, with, the, alpilles, in, the, background, 1889, about, which, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, van, gogh, wrote, at, last, i, have, a, landscape, with, olives, while, in, saint, r, my, van, gogh, spent, time, outside, the, asylum, where, he, painted, trees, in, the, olive, groves, in, these, works, natural, life, is, rendered, as, gnarled, and, arthritic, as, if, a, personification, of, the, natural, world, which, are, according, to, hughes, filled, with, a, continuous, field, of, energy, of, which, nature, is, a, manifestation, the, flowering, orchards, also, the, orchards, in, blossom, are, among, the, first, groups, of, work, completed, after, van, gogh, s, arrival, in, arles, in, february, 1888, the, 14, paintings, are, optimistic, joyous, and, visually, expressive, of, the, burgeoning, spring, they, are, delicately, sensitive, and, unpopulated, he, painted, swiftly, and, although, he, brought, to, this, series, a, version, of, impressionism, a, strong, sense, of, personal, style, began, to, emerge, during, this, period, the, transience, of, the, blossoming, trees, and, the, passing, of, the, season, seemed, to, align, with, his, sense, of, impermanence, and, belief, in, a, new, beginning, in, arles, during, the, blossoming, of, the, trees, that, spring, he, found, a, world, of, motifs, that, could, not, have, been, more, japanese, vincent, wrote, to, theo, on, 21, april, 1888, that, he, had, 10, orchards, and, one, big, of, a, cherry, tree, which, i, ve, spoiled, during, this, period, van, gogh, mastered, the, use, of, light, by, subjugating, shadows, and, painting, the, trees, as, if, they, are, the, source, of, light, almost, in, a, sacred, manner, early, the, following, year, he, painted, another, smaller, group, of, orchards, including, view, of, arles, flowering, orchards, van, gogh, was, enthralled, by, the, landscape, and, vegetation, of, the, south, of, france, and, often, visited, the, farm, gardens, near, arles, in, the, vivid, light, of, the, mediterranean, climate, his, palette, significantly, brightened, van, gogh, made, several, painting, excursions, during, visits, to, the, landscape, around, arles, he, made, paintings, of, harvests, wheat, fields, and, other, rural, landmarks, of, the, area, including, the, old, mill, 1888, a, good, example, of, a, picturesque, structure, bordering, the, wheat, fields, beyond, at, various, points, van, gogh, painted, the, view, from, his, window, at, the, hague, antwerp, and, paris, these, works, culminated, in, the, wheat, field, series, which, depicted, the, view, from, his, cells, in, the, asylum, at, saint, r, my, many, of, the, late, paintings, are, sombre, but, essentially, optimistic, and, right, up, to, the, time, of, van, gogh, s, death, reflect, his, desire, to, return, to, lucid, mental, health, yet, some, of, his, final, works, reflect, his, deepening, concerns, writing, in, july, 1890, from, auvers, van, gogh, said, that, he, had, become, absorbed, in, the, immense, plain, against, the, hills, boundless, as, the, sea, delicate, yellow, van, gogh, was, captivated, by, the, fields, in, may, when, the, wheat, was, young, and, green, his, wheatfields, at, auvers, with, white, house, shows, a, more, subdued, palette, of, yellows, and, blues, which, creates, a, sense, of, idyllic, harmony, about, 10, july, 1890, van, gogh, wrote, to, theo, of, vast, fields, of, wheat, under, troubled, skies, wheatfield, with, crows, shows, the, artist, s, state, of, mind, in, his, final, days, hulsker, describes, the, work, as, a, doom, filled, painting, with, threatening, skies, and, ill, omened, crows, its, dark, palette, and, heavy, brushstrokes, convey, a, sense, of, menace, after, van, gogh, s, first, exhibitions, in, the, late, 1880s, his, reputation, grew, steadily, among, artists, art, critics, dealers, and, collectors, in, 1887, andr, antoine, hung, van,
