from, egypt, assassinated, uthman, amr, distanced, himself, from, their, cause, despite, previously, instigating, opposition, against, uthman, in, the, ensuing, first, fitna, amr, joined, mu, awiya,

as, ibn, wa, il, was, a, wealthy, landowner, from, the, banu, sahm, clan, of, the, quraysh, tribe, of, mecca, following, the, death, of, al, as, in, c, 622, amr, inherited, from, him, the, lucrative,

of, the, banu, fihr, and, a, half, sister, from, the, banu, abd, shams, amr, is, physically, described, in, the, traditional, sources, as, being, short, with, broad, shoulders, having, a, large, head, with, a, wide, forehead, and, wide, mouth, long, arms, and, a, long, beard, there, are, conflicting, reports, about, when, amr, embraced, islam, with, the, most, credible, version, placing, it, in, 629, 630, not, long, before, the, conquest, of, mecca, by, muhammad, according, to, this, account, he, converted, alongside, the, qurayshites, khalid, ibn, al, walid, and, uthman, ibn, talha, according, to, amr, s, own, testimony, transmitted, by, his, fourth, generation, descendant, amr, ibn, shu, ayb, he, converted, in, axum, in, the, presence, of, king, armah, najashi, and, met, muhammad, in, medina, upon, the, latter, s, return, from, the, battle, of, khaybar, in, 628, amr, conditioned, his, conversion, on, the, forgiveness, of, his, past, sins, and, an, active, part, in, affairs, according, to, a, report, cited, by, the, historian, ibn, asakir, d, 1176, indeed, in, october, 629, amr, was, tasked, by, muhammad, with, leading, the, raid, on, dhat, al, salasil, likely, located, in, the, northern, hejaz, western, arabia, a, lucrative, opportunity, for, amr, in, view, of, the, potential, war, spoils, the, purpose, of, the, raid, is, unclear, though, the, modern, historian, fred, donner, speculates, that, it, was, to, break, up, a, gathering, of, hostile, tribal, groups, possibly, backed, by, the, byzantine, empire, the, historian, ibn, hisham, d, 833, holds, that, amr, rallied, the, nomadic, arabs, in, the, region, to, make, war, on, syria, the, tribal, groups, targeted, in, the, raid, included, the, quda, a, in, general, and, the, bali, specifically, amr, s, paternal, grandmother, hailed, from, the, bali, and, this, may, have, motivated, his, appointment, to, the, command, by, muhammad, as, amr, was, instructed, to, recruit, tribesmen, from, the, bali, and, the, other, quda, a, tribes, of, balqayn, and, banu, udhra, following, the, raid, a, delegation, of, the, bali, embraced, islam, amr, further, consecrated, ties, with, the, tribe, by, marrying, a, bali, woman, with, whom, he, had, his, son, muhammad, muhammad, appointed, amr, as, the, governor, of, oman, and, he, remained, there, until, being, informed, of, muhammad, s, death, in, 632, amr, was, personally, chosen, by, muhammad, to, deliver, a, letter, calling, the, kings, of, oman, the, julanda, brothers, abd, and, jayfa, to, convert, to, islam, while, being, accompanied, by, sa, id, ibn, aws, al, ansari, historian, al, baladhuri, reports, that, on, their, departure, to, sohar, muhammad, said, to, them, if, these, people, of, oman, accept, the, witness, of, truth, and, pledge, obedience, to, allah, and, his, prophet, amr, will, be, the, commander, and, abu, zayd, will, officiate, in, prayer, propagate, islam, and, teach, the, qur, an, and, the, institutions, of, the, prophet, the, death, of, muhammad, prompted, several, arab, tribes, to, defect, from, the, nascent, medina, based, muslim, polity, in, the, ridda, wars, muhammad, s, successor, caliph, abu, bakr, r, 632, 634, appointed, amr, to, rein, in, the, apostate, quda, a, tribes, and, among, those, targeted, were, the, hejazi, branches, of, the, bali, amr, s, campaigns, which, were, supported, by, the, commander, shurahbil, ibn, hasana, succeeded, in, restoring, medina, s, authority, as, far, as, the, northern, frontier, with, syria, amr, was, one, of, four, commanders, dispatched, by, abu, bakr, to, conquer, syria, in, 633, the, focus, of, amr, s, campaign, was, palestine, to, which, he, had, been, appointed, governor, by, abu, bakr, before, his, departure, as, a, qurayshite, merchant, amr, was, likely, already, well, acquainted, with, the, routes, to, gaza, a, principle, terminal, for, meccan, caravans, he, took, the, coastal, route, of, the, hejaz, reaching, ayla, a, muslim, possession, since, 630, before, breaking, west, into, the, negev, desert, or, possibly, the, sinai, he, arrived, near, the, villages, of, dathin, and, badan, in, gaza, s, environs, where, he, entered, into, talks, with, gaza, s, byzantine, commander, after, the, negotiations, broke, down, amr, s, men, bested, the, byzantines, at, the, battle, of, dathin, on, 4, february, 634, and, set, up, headquarters, at, ghamr, al, arabat, in, the, middle, of, the, wadi, araba, most, accounts, hold, that, amr, s, army, was, 3, 000, strong, the, muhajirun, emigrants, from, mecca, to, medina, and, the, ansar, natives, of, medina, who, together, formed, the, core, of, the, earliest, muslim, converts, dominated, his, forces, according, to, al, waqidi, d, 823, while, the, 9th, century, historian, ibn, a, tham, holds, that, amr, s, army, consisted, of, 3, 300, qurayshite, and, allied, horsemen, 1, 700, horsemen, from, the, banu, sulaym, and, 200, from, the, yemenite, tribe, of, madh, hij, the, historian, philip, mayerson, considers, the, troop, figures, to, be, unquestionably, exaggerated, but, still, representing, the, largest, arab, fighting, force, to, have, ever, been, assembled, in, southern, palestine, and, the, sinai, until, then, amr, conquered, the, area, around, gaza, by, february, or, march, 634, and, proceeded, to, besiege, caesarea, the, capital, of, byzantine, palestine, in, july, he, soon, after, abandoned, the, siege, upon, the, approach, of, a, large, byzantine, army, after, being, reinforced, by, the, remainder, of, the, muslim, armies, in, syria, including, the, new, arrivals, commanded, by, khalid, ibn, al, walid, amr, with, overall, command, of, the, 20, 000, strong, muslim, forces, routed, the, byzantine, army, at, the, battle, of, ajnadayn, the, first, major, confrontation, between, the, muslims, and, byzantium, in, july, august, 634, amr, occupied, numerous, towns, in, palestine, including, bayt, jibrin, yibna, amwas, lydda, jaffa, nablus, and, sebastia, most, of, these, localities, surrendered, after, little, resistance, due, to, the, flight, of, byzantine, troops, consequently, there, is, scant, information, about, them, in, the, traditional, accounts, of, the, conquest, abu, bakr, s, successor, umar, r, 634, 644, appointed, or, confirmed, amr, as, the, commander, of, the, military, district, of, palestine, the, muslims, pursued, the, byzantine, army, northward, and, besieged, them, at, pella, for, four, months, amr, may, have, retained, overall, command, of, the, muslim, armies, until, this, point, though, other, accounts, assign, command, to, khalid, or, abu, ubayda, ibn, al, jarrah, in, any, case, the, muslims, landed, a, heavy, blow, against, the, byzantines, in, the, ensuing, battle, of, fahl, in, december, 634, or, january, 635, afterward, amr, and, shurahbil, may, have, been, sent, to, besiege, beisan, which, capitulated, after, minor, resistance, the, muslims, proceeded, to, besiege, damascus, where, the, remnants, of, the, byzantine, army, from, the, battles, of, ajnadayn, and, fahl, had, gathered, amr, was, positioned, at, the, bab, tuma, gate, the, muslim, commanders, having, each, been, assigned, to, block, one, of, the, city, s, entrances, by, august, september, 635, damascus, surrendered, to, the, muslims, amr, acquired, several, residences, within, the, city, in, response, to, the, series, of, defeats, the, byzantine, emperor, heraclius, r, 610, 641, led, a, large, army, in, person, to, confront, the, muslims, its, rout, at, the, battle, of, yarmouk, in, which, amr, played, a, key, role, by, confining, the, byzantines, between, the, banks, of, the, yarmouk, river, and, the, yarmouk, s, ravine, in, august, september, 636, paved, the, way, for, the, rest, of, syria, s, conquest, by, the, muslims, following, yarmouk, the, muslims, attempted, to, capture, jerusalem, where, amr, had, previously, sent, an, advance, force, abu, ubayda, led, the, siege, of, jerusalem, in, which, amr, participated, but, the, city, only, surrendered, after, caliph, umar, arrived, in, person, to, conclude, a, treaty, with, its, defenders, amr, was, one, of, the, witnesses, of, the, treaty, of, umar, from, jerusalem, amr, proceeded, to, besiege, and, capture, the, city, of, gaza, from, his, base, in, southern, palestine, amr, launched, the, conquest, of, byzantine, egypt, he, had, established, trading, interests, there, before, his, conversion, to, islam, making, him, aware, of, its, importance, in, international, trade, the, traditional, muslim, sources, generally, hold, that, amr, undertook, the, campaign, with, caliph, umar, s, reluctant, approval, though, a, number, of, accounts, hold, that, he, entered, the, region, without, umar, s, authorization, at, the, head, of, 4, 000, cavalries, and, with, no, siege, engines, amr, arrived, at, the, frontier, town, of, al, arish, along, the, northern, sinai, coastline, on, 12, december, 639, he, captured, the, strategic, mediterranean, port, city, of, pelusium, al, farama, following, a, month, long, siege, and, moved, against, bilbeis, which, also, fell, after, a, month, long, siege, amr, halted, his, campaign, before, the, fortified, byzantine, stronghold, of, babylon, at, the, head, of, the, nile, delta, and, requested, reinforcements, from, umar, the, latter, dispatched, al, zubayr, ibn, al, awwam, a, leading, qurayshite, companion, of, muhammad, with, a, 4, 000, strong, force, which, joined, amr, s, camp, in, june, 640, amr, retained, the, supreme, command, of, arab, forces, in, egypt, in, the, following, month, his, army, decisively, defeated, the, byzantines, at, the, battle, of, heliopolis, he, captured, memphis, soon, after, and, besieged, babylon, during, the, siege, amr, entered, truce, negotiations, with, the, alexandria, based, byzantine, governor, cyrus, emperor, heraclius, opposed, the, talks, and, recalled, cyrus, to, constantinople, though, strong, resistance, was, put, up, by, babylon, s, defenders, their, morale, was, sapped, after, news, of, heraclius, death, in, february, 641, amr, made, an, agreement, with, the, byzantine, garrison, allowing, their, peaceful, withdrawal, toward, the, provincial, capital, alexandria, on, 9, april, 641, amr, then, sent, his, lieutenants, to, conquer, different, parts, of, the, country, one, of, them, kharija, ibn, hudhafa, captured, the, fayyum, oasis, oxyrhynchus, bahnasa, hermopolis, el, ashmunein, and, akhmim, all, in, middle, egypt, and, an, unspecified, number, of, villages, in, upper, egypt, in, late, 641, amr, besieged, alexandria, it, fell, virtually, without, resistance, after, cyrus, who, had, since, been, restored, to, office, and, amr, finalized, a, treaty, in, babylon, guaranteeing, the, security, of, egypt, s, inhabitants, and, imposing, a, poll, tax, on, adult, males, the, date, of, the, city, s, surrender, was, likely, november, 642, taking, advantage, of, the, uncertain, political, situation, in, the, wake, of, umar, s, death, in, 644, and, the, meager, arab, military, presence, in, alexandria, emperor, constans, ii, r, 641, 668, dispatched, a, naval, expedition, led, by, a, certain, manuel, which, occupied, the, city, and, killed, most, of, its, arab, garrison, in, 645, alexandria, s, elite, and, most, of, the, inhabitants, assisted, the, byzantines, medieval, byzantine, coptic, and, to, a, lesser, extent, muslim, sources, indicate, the, city, was, not, firmly, in, arab, hands, during, the, preceding, three, years, byzantine, forces, pushed, deeper, into, the, nile, delta, but, amr, forced, them, back, at, the, battle, of, nikiou, he, besieged, and, captured, alexandria, in, the, summer, of, 646, most, of, the, byzantines, including, manuel, were, slain, many, of, its, inhabitants, were, killed, and, the, city, was, burned, until, amr, ordered, an, end, to, the, onslaught, afterward, muslim, rule, in, alexandria, was, gradually, solidified, in, contrast, to, the, disarray, of, the, byzantine, defense, the, muslim, forces, under, amr, s, command, were, unified, and, organized, amr, frequently, coordinated, with, caliph, umar, and, his, own, troops, for, all, major, military, decisions, according, to, the, historian, vassilios, christides, amr, cautiously, counterbalanced, the, superiority, in, numbers, and, equipment, of, the, byzantine, army, by, applying, skillful, military, tactics, and, despite, the, lack, of, definite, prepared, long, term, plans, the, arab, army, moved, with, great, flexibility, as, the, occasion, arose, in, the, absence, of, siege, engines, amr, oversaw, long, sieges, of, heavily, fortified, byzantine, positions, most, prominently, babylon, cut, supply, lines, and, engaged, in, long, wars, of, attrition, he, made, advantageous, use, out, of, the, nomads, in, his, ranks, who, were, seasoned, in, hit, and, run, tactics, and, his, settled, troops, who, were, generally, more, acquainted, with, siege, warfare, his, cavalry, dominated, army, moved, through, egypt, s, deserts, and, oases, with, relative, ease, moreover, political, circumstances, became, more, favorable, to, amr, with, the, death, of, the, hawkish, heraclius, and, his, short, term, replacement, with, the, more, pacifist, heraklonas, and, martina, after, the, surrender, of, alexandria, in, 642, amr, marched, his, army, westward, bypassing, the, fortified, byzantine, coastal, strongholds, of, paraetonium, marsa, matruh, appolonia, sozusa, marsa, soussa, and, ptolemais, tolmeita, capturing, barca, and, reaching, torca, in, cyrenaica, toward, the, end, of, the, year, amr, launched, a, second, cavalry, assault, targeting, tripoli, the, city, was, heavily, fortified, by, the, byzantines, and, contained, several, naval, vessels, in, its, harbor, due, to, his, lack, of, siege, engines, he, employed, the, lengthy, siege, tactic, used, in, the, egyptian, conquest, after, about, a, month, his, troops, entered, tripoli, through, a, vulnerable, point, in, its, walls, and, sacked, the, city, its, fall, which, entailed, the, evacuation, by, sea, of, the, byzantine, garrison, and, most, of, the, population, is, dated, to, 642, or, 643, 44, though, the, arab, hold, over, cyrenaica, and, zawila, to, the, far, south, remained, firm, for, decades, except, for, a, short, lived, byzantine, occupation, in, 690, tripoli, was, recaptured, by, the, byzantines, a, few, years, after, amr, s, entry, the, region, was, definitively, conquered, by, the, arabs, during, the, reign, of, caliph, abd, al, malik, r, 685, 705, amr, regulated, the, government, of, the, country, administration, of, justice, and, the, imposition, of, taxes, according, to, the, historian, a, j, wensinck, during, his, siege, of, babylon, amr, had, erected, an, encampment, near, the, fortress, he, originally, intended, for, alexandria, to, serve, as, the, arabs, capital, in, egypt, but, umar, rejected, this, on, the, basis, that, no, body, of, water, i, e, the, nile, should, separate, the, caliph, from, his, army, instead, following, alexandria, s, surrender, in, 641, or, 642, amr, made, his, encampment, near, babylon, the, permanent, garrison, town, mi, r, of, fustat, the, first, town, founded, by, the, arabs, in, egypt, its, location, along, the, eastern, bank, of, the, nile, river, and, at, the, head, of, the, nile, delta, and, edge, of, the, eastern, desert, strategically, positioned, it, to, dominate, the, upper, and, lower, halves, of, egypt, fustat, s, proximity, to, babylon, where, amr, also, established, an, arab, garrison, afforded, the, arab, settlers, a, convenient, means, to, employ, and, oversee, the, coptic, bureaucratic, officials, who, inhabited, babylon, and, proved, critical, to, running, the, day, to, day, affairs, of, the, arab, government, amr, had, the, original, tents, of, fustat, replaced, with, mud, brick, and, baked, brick, dwellings, documents, found, in, hermopolis, al, ashmunayn, dating, from, the, 640s, confirm, official, orders, to, forward, building, materials, to, babylon, to, construct, the, new, city, the, city, was, organized, into, allotments, over, an, area, stretching, 5, 6, kilometers, 3, 1, 3, 7, mi, along, the, nile, and, 1, 2, kilometers, 0, 62, 1, 24, mi, inland, to, the, east, the, allotments, were, distributed, among, the, components, of, amr, s, army, with, priority, given, to, the, quraysh, the, ansar, and, amr, s, personal, guard, the, ahl, al, r, ya, people, of, the, banner, which, included, several, bali, tribesmen, as, a, result, of, their, kinship, and, marital, ties, to, amr, an, opposing, theory, holds, that, amr, did, not, assign, the, plots, rather, the, tribes, staked, their, own, claims, and, amr, established, a, commission, to, resolve, the, ensuing, land, disputes, at, the, center, of, the, new, capital, amr, built, a, congregational, mosque, later, known, as, the, amr, ibn, al, as, mosque, the, original, structure, was, frequently, redesigned, and, expanded, between, its, foundation, and, its, final, form, in, 827, amr, had, his, own, dwelling, built, immediately, east, of, the, mosque, and, it, most, likely, served, as, his, government, headquarters, in, the, northwestern, part, of, alexandria, amr, built, a, hilltop, congregational, mosque, later, called, after, him, before, the, byzantine, occupation, of, 645, 46, after, which, he, built, a, second, called, the, mosque, of, mercy, neither, mosque, has, been, presently, identified, adjacent, to, the, congregational, mosque, amr, took, personal, ownership, of, a, fort, which, he, later, donated, for, government, use, this, part, of, the, city, became, the, administrative, and, social, core, of, arab, settlement, in, alexandria, accounts, vary, as, to, the, number, of, troops, amr, garrisoned, in, the, city, ranging, from, 1, 000, soldiers, from, the, azd, and, banu, fahm, tribes, to, a, quarter, of, the, army, which, was, replaced, on, a, rotational, basis, every, six, months, as, per, the, 641, treaty, with, cyrus, amr, imposed, a, poll, tax, of, two, gold, dinars, on, non, muslim, adult, males, he, imposed, other, measures, sanctioned, by, umar, that, entailed, the, inhabitants, regular, provision, of, wheat, honey, oil, and, vinegar, as, a, subsistence, allowance, for, the, arab, troops, he, had, these, goods, stored, in, a, distribution, warehouse, called, d, r, al, rizq, after, taking, a, census, of, the, muslims, he, further, ordered, that, each, muslim, be, annually, supplied, by, the, inhabitants, a, highly, embroidered, wool, robe, egyptian, robes, were, prized, by, the, arabs, a, burnous, a, turban, a, sirwal, trousers, and, shoes, in, a, greek, papyrus, dated,

egyptian, village, according, to, the, historian, martin, hinds, there, is, no, evidence, that, amr, did, anything, to, streamline, the, cumbersome, fiscal, system, taken, over, from, the, byzantines, rather, the, upheavals, of, conquest, can, only, have, made, the, system, more, open, to, abuse, than, ever, after, entering, alexandria, amr, invited, the, coptic, patriarch, benjamin, to, return, to, the, city, after, his, years, of, exile, under, cyrus, the, patriarch, maintained, close, ties, with, amr, and, restored, the, monasteries, of, wadi, al, natrun, including, the, saint, macarius, monastery, which, functions, until, the, present, day, according, to, the, historian, hugh, n, kennedy, benjamin, played, a, major, role, in, the, survival, of, the, coptic, church, through, the, transition, to, arab, rule, amr, acted, relatively, independent, as, governor, and, retained, much, of, the, surplus, tax, revenue, of, the, province, for, the, benefit, of, its, troops, despite, pressure, from, umar, to, forward, proceeds, to, medina, he, also, amassed, significant, personal, wealth, in, egypt, part, of, which, was, confiscated, by, muhammad, ibn, maslama, on, umar, s,

644, 656, initially, kept, amr, in, his, governorship, and, forged, marital, links, with, him, by, wedding, to, him, his, maternal, half, sister, umm, kulthum, bint, uqba, ibn, abi, mu, ayt, uthman, diluted, amr, s, power, in, 645, 46, by, transferring, fiscal, responsibilities, to, ibn, abi, sarh, his, own, relative, leaving, amr, in, charge, of, military, affairs, amr, and, ibn, sa, d, lodged, complaints, to, uthman, each, alleging, the, other, of, incompetence, prompting, uthman, to, dismiss, amr, entirely, and, replace, him, in, his, duties, with, ibn, sa, d, uthman, s, appointee, established, an, effective, fiscal, system, that, largely, preserved, its, byzantine, predecessor, ibn, sa, d, reduced, the, fiscal, privileges, of, egypt, s, original, arab, military, settlers, who, had, been, shown, favor, by, amr, and, secured, the, remittance, of, the, surplus, to, medina, this, led, to, the, consternation, of, the, arab, garrisons, and, the, native, officials, and, elite, all, of, whom, were, deprived, of, the, opportunities, for, self, enrichment, which, they, had, hitherto, enjoyed, according, to, hinds, open, opposition, to, ibn, sa, d, and, uthman, began, under, the, leadership, of, the, qurayshite, muhammad, ibn, abi, hudhayfa, in, 654, 55, upon, his, return, to, medina, amr, divorced, umm, kulthum, and, openly, criticized, uthman, the, caliph, and, amr, engaged, in, a, number, of, heated, public, exchanges, and, according, to, a, report, in, the, islamic, traditional, sources, amr, incited, muhammad, s, senior, companions, ali, al, zubayr, and, talha, ibn, ubayd, allah, as, well, as, the, hajj, pilgrims, in, mecca, against, uthman, he, lobbied, muhammad, s, wife, a, isha, for, support, and, the, latter, pressed, uthman, to, reappoint, amr, to, egypt, citing, its, garrisons, satisfaction, with, his, rule, in, a, sermon, at, the, mosque, in, medina, in, june, 656, and, a, letter, penned, to, the, muslim, leaders, in, syria, uthman, mentioned, that, he, had, intended, to, reappoint, amr, but, did, not, follow, through, as, a, result, of, the, latter, s, excessive, insult, according, to, the, historian, wilferd, madelung, the, insult, uthman, cited, was, likely, amr, s, public, reaction, to, the, caliph, s, statement, that, the, mutinous, egyptian, troops, who, had, arrived, in, medina, to, protest, the, caliph, s, policies, had, withdrawn, because, they, were, misinformed, fear, god, uthman, for, you, have, ridden, over, abysses, and, we, have, ridden, over, them, with, you, so, repent, to, god, that, we, may, repent, after, his, last, exchange, with, uthman, amr, retired, to, his, estate, in, southern, palestine, the, estate, was, called, ajlan, after, one, of, his, maw, l, non, arab, muslim, freedmen, and, was, located, in, the, vicinity, of, al, sab, which, had, conventionally, been, identified, with, modern, beersheba, but, more, likely, corresponds, with, bayt, jibrin, according, to, the, historian, michael, lecker, the, medieval, historians, al, baladhuri, d, 892, and, yaqut, al, hamawi, d, 1226, also, suggest, that, ajlan, was, located, in, the, area, of, bayt, jibrin, amr, had, likely, become, owner, of, the, estate, through, a, caliphal, grant, though, he, possibly, could, have, taken, possession, of, it, in, the, course, of, his, conquest, of, palestine, and, his, ownership, had, been, confirmed, by, the, caliphs, he, lived, on, the, estate, where, he, derived, agricultural, revenue, with, his, sons, muhammad, and, abd, allah, at, his, estate, amr, received, news, of, the, siege, of, uthman, s, house, and, the, caliph, s, subsequent, assassination, by, amr, s, egyptian, partisans, the, roughly, 400, 600, egyptian, mutineers, had, protested, uthman, s, fiscal, centralization, policies, in, medina, and, accused, him, of, favoring, his, relatives, over, the, early, muslim, converts, the, caliph, persuaded, them, to, withdraw, but, after, they, intercepted, a, letter, on, their, departure, ordering, ibn, abi, sarh, to, punish, them, they, turned, back, and, assaulted, uthman, in, his, home, in, an, anecdote, cited, by, al, baladhuri, amr, is, quoted, taking, partial, credit, for, uthman, s, killing, ali, succeeded, uthman, but, did, not, reappoint, amr, to, his, post, in, egypt, amr, was, one, of, a, number, of, figures, held, culpable, for, uthman, s, death, by, the, slain, caliph, s, clan, the, banu, umayya, umayyads, most, prominently, by, uthman, s, uterine, brother, and, amr, s, former, brother, in, law, al, walid, ibn, uqba, nonetheless, the, governor, of, syria, which, included, palestine, the, umayyad, mu, awiya, ibn, abi, sufyan, had, left, amr, on, his, estate, undisturbed, as, pressure, from, the, umayyads, increased, against, him, amr, distanced, himself, from, any, role, in, uthman, s, death, and, wrote, mu, awiya, to, execute, or, banish, the, participating, egyptian, troops, who, had, been, apprehended, when, they, passed, through, mu, awiya, s, jurisdiction, on, their, way, back, to, egypt, after, ali, s, victory, against, al, zubayr, talha, and, a, isha, at, the, battle, of, the, camel, in, iraq, mu, awiya, who, maintained, his, opposition, to, ali, became, the, focus, of, the, caliph, s, attention, mu, awiya, summoned, amr, to, discuss, an, alliance, against, ali, in, the, ensuing, negotiations, amr, pressed, mu, awiya, for, lifetime, possession, of, egypt, to, which, mu, awiya, ultimately, acceded, after, being, persuaded, by, his, brother, utba, ibn, abi, sufyan, the, public, agreement, composed, by, amr, s, mawl, wardan, and, made, in, jerusalem, secured, amr, s, allegiance, to, mu, awiya, in, return, for, the, latter, s, assistance, in, gaining, control, of, egypt, from, ali, s, governor, according, to, madelung, the, alliance, between, mu, awiya, and, amr, b, al, as, constituted, a, formidable, political, force, in, forging, the, alliance, mu, awiya, sought, to, benefit, from, amr, s, political, acumen, practical, battle, experience, and, sure, judgement, of, military, strategy, and, tactics, as, well, as, his, expertise, and, support, base, in, egypt, amr, became, mu, awiya, s, chief, adviser, to, secure, the, defense, of, his, syrian, realm, from, ali, s, loyalists, in, egypt, amr, counseled, mu, awiya, to, secure, the, support, of, the, judhamite, chief, in, palestine, natil, ibn, qays, by, ignoring, his, seizure, of, the, district, treasury, natil, subsequently, joined, mu, awiya, s, cause, amr, then, advised, mu, awiya, to, lead, the, syrian, army, in, person, against, ali, who, began, his, march, toward, syria, in, late, may, 657, when, ali, s, army, set, up, camp, around, siffin, south, of, the, euphrates, town, of, raqqa, in, early, june, mu, awiya, s, advance, guard, led, by, abu, al, a, war, refused, them, access, to, the, watering, places, under, their, control, after, ali, protested, amr, advised, mu, awiya, to, accept, their, request, as, preventing, access, to, water, might, rally, the, hitherto, demotivated, iraqis, to, a, determined, fight, against, the, syrians, mu, awiya, refused, and, the, iraqis, subsequently, defeated, the, syrians, led, by, amr, and, abu, al, a, war, in, a, skirmish, known, as, the, day, of, the, euphrates, as, head, of, the, syrian, cavalry, amr, held, the, overall, field, command, for, mu, awiya, s, forces, in, the, ensuing, weeks, long, battle, of, siffin, and, on, occasion, personally, participated, in, direct, combat, though, without, particular, distinction, at, one, point, in, the, battle, he, raised, a, black, fabric, given, to, him, by, muhammad, at, the, tip, of, his, spear, symbolizing, the, command, role, given, to, him, by, muhammad, as, the, iraqis, gained, the, battlefield, advantage, amr, proposed, to, mu, awiya, that, their, men, tie, leaves, from, the, qur, an, at, the, tips, of, their, lances, in, an, appeal, to, ali, s, men, to, settle, the, conflict, peacefully, it, served, as, a, successful, ruse, which, ended, the, fighting, as, the, battle, turned, in, ali, s, favor, and, sowed, uncertainty, in, ali, s, ranks, the, caliph, heeded, the, majority, will, in, his, army, to, settle, the, matter, diplomatically, an, arbitration, was, agreed, with, amr, representing, mu, awiya, and, abu, musa, al, ash, ari, representing, ali, amr, met, with, ali, once, and, the, two, exchanged, insults, but, ali, ultimately, agreed, to, amr, s, condition, that, he, omit, his, caliphal, title, amir, al, mu, minin, commander, of, the, faithful, from, the, preliminary, arbitration, document, drafted, on, 2, august, the, omission, effectively, placed, ali, and, mu, awiya, on, an, equal, political, footing, and, thereby, weakened, ali, s, leadership, position, over, the, muslim, polity, amr, and, abu, musa, likely, met, twice, at, dumat, al, jandal, and, then, adhruh, to, forge, an, agreement, at, dumat, al, jandal, amr, succeeded, in, gaining, abu, musa, s, recognition, that, uthman, was, wrongfully, killed, a, verdict, opposed, by, ali, and, which, strengthened, syrian, support, for, mu, awiya, who, had, taken, up, the, cause, of, revenge, for, the, death, of, his, kinsman, uthman, at, the, last, meeting, in, adhruh, the, office, of, the, caliphate, was, discussed, but, the, meeting, ended, in, violence, and, without, agreement, during, the, brawl, amr, was, physically, assaulted, by, a, kufan, partisan, of, ali, but, the, latter, was, fended, off, by, one, of, amr, s, sons, abu, musa, retired, to, mecca, while, amr, and, the, syrians, returned, to, mu, awiya, and, recognized, him, as, amir, al, mu, minin, before, formally, pledging, allegiance, to, him, in, april, may, 658, as, a, result, amr, was, among, those, invoked, in, a, ritual, curse, issued, by, ali, during, the, morning, prayers, and, became, the, subject, of, derision, among, the, kufan, core, of, ali, s, supporters, as, early, as, 656, 57, amr, and, mu, awiya, persuaded, ibn, abi, hudhayfa, who, had, seized, control, of, egypt, after, uthman, s, assassination, to, meet, them, in, al, arish, where, they, took, him, captive, in, a, ruse, amr, and, mu, awiya, did, not, advance, further, than, this, point, and, ibn, abi, hudhayfa, was, executed, ali, s, second, governor, in, egypt, qays, ibn, sa, d, was, dismissed, in, late, 657, due, to, concerns, that, he, would, defect, to, mu, awiya, and, his, next, appointee, malik, ibn, al, harith, died, in, qulzum, suez, on, his, way, to, the, province, malik, s, replacement, was, muhammad, ibn, abi, bakr, son, of, the, first, caliph, and, a, foster, son, of, ali, ibn, abi, bakr, burned, the, homes, and, arrested, the, families, of, pro, uthman, mutineers, from, the, fustat, garrison, led, by, mu, awiya, ibn, hudayj, and, maslama, ibn, mukhallad, the, latter, two, requested, intervention, by, mu, awiya, who, dispatched, amr, to, egypt, with, a, 4, 000, 6, 000, strong, army, despite, his, thirteen, year, absence, from, egypt, amr, nonetheless, mustered, the, support, of, egypt, s, original, arab, military, settlers, and, their, sons, in, july, august, 658, his, forces, defeated, ali, s, troops, at, the, battle, of, al, musannah, between, heliopolis, ain, shams, and, fustat, he, subsequently, captured, fustat, ibn, hudayj, pursued, and, captured, ibn, abi, bakr, and, had, him, executed, over, the, objections, of, amr, who, had, been, lobbied, by, ibn, abi, bakr, s, brother, abd, al, rahman, to, spare, his, life, as, per, his, agreement, with, mu, awiya, amr, was, installed, as, governor, of, egypt, for, life, and, ruled, as, a, virtual, partner, rather, than, a, subordinate, of, mu, awiya, who, had, become, caliph, after, ali, s, assassination, and, his, son, hasan, s, abdication, in, 661, on, 22, january, of, that, year, amr, escaped, an, assassination, attempt, by, the, kharijite, zadawayh, or, amr, ibn, bakr, who, killed, amr, s, stand, in,

680, 690, who, was, generally, critical, of, arab, rule, said, of, amr, that, he, had, no, mercy, on, the, egyptians, and, did, not, observe, the, covenant, they, had, made, with, him, but, also, says, of, him, that, he, exacted, the, taxes, which, had, been, determined, upon, but, he, took, none, of, the, property, of, the, churches, and, he, committed, no, act, of, spoliation, or, plunder,
