picasso, s, later, work, picasso, s, training, under, his, father, began, before, 1890, his, progress, can, be, traced, in, the, collection, of, early, works, now, held, by, the, museu, picasso, in,

large, composition, that, depicts, his, sister, lola, in, the, same, year, at, the, age, of, 14, he, painted, portrait, of, aunt, pepa, a, vigorous, and, dramatic, portrait, that, juan, eduardo, cirlot, has, called, without, a, doubt, one, of, the, greatest, in, the, whole, history, of, spanish, painting, in, 1897, his, realism, began, to, show, a, symbolist, influence, for, example, in, a, series, of, landscape, paintings, rendered, in, non, naturalistic, violet, and, green, tones, what, some, call, his, modernist, period, 1899, 1900, followed, his, exposure, to, the, work, of, rossetti, steinlen, toulouse, lautrec, and, edvard, munch, combined, with, his, admiration, for, favourite, old, masters, such, as, el, greco, led, picasso, to, a, personal, version, of, modernism, in, his, works, of, this, period, picasso, made, his, first, trip, to, paris, then, the, art, capital, of, europe, in, 1900, there, he, met, his, first, parisian, friend, journalist, and, poet, max, jacob, who, helped, picasso, learn, the, language, and, its, literature, soon, they, shared, an, apartment, max, slept, at, night, while, picasso, slept, during, the, day, and, worked, at, night, these, were, times, of, severe, poverty, cold, and, desperation, much, of, his, work, was, burned, to, keep, the, small, room, warm, during, the, first, five, months, of, 1901, picasso, lived, in, madrid, where, he, and, his, anarchist, friend, francisco, de, as, s, soler, founded, the, magazine, arte, joven, young, art, which, published, five, issues, soler, solicited, articles, and, picasso, illustrated, the, journal, mostly, contributing, grim, cartoons, depicting, and, sympathizing, with, the, state, of, the, poor, the, first, issue, was, published, on, 31, march, 1901, by, which, time, the, artist, had, started, to, sign, his, work, picasso, from, 1898, he, signed, his, works, as, pablo, ruiz, picasso, then, as, pablo, r, picasso, until, 1901, the, change, does, not, seem, to, imply, a, rejection, of, the, father, figure, rather, he, wanted, to, distinguish, himself, from, others, initiated, by, his, catalan, friends, who, habitually, called, him, by, his, maternal, surname, much, less, current, than, the, paternal, ruiz, picasso, s, blue, period, 1901, 1904, characterized, by, sombre, paintings, rendered, in, shades, of, blue, and, blue, green, only, occasionally, warmed, by, other, colours, began, either, in, spain, in, early, 1901, or, in, paris, in, the, second, half, of, the, year, many, paintings, of, gaunt, mothers, with, children, date, from, the, blue, period, during, which, picasso, divided, his, time, between, barcelona, and, paris, in, his, austere, use, of, colour, and, sometimes, doleful, subject, matter, prostitutes, and, beggars, are, frequent, subjects, picasso, was, influenced, by, a, trip, through, spain, and, by, the, suicide, of, his, friend, carles, casagemas, starting, in, autumn, of, 1901, he, painted, several, posthumous, portraits, of, casagemas, culminating, in, the, gloomy, allegorical, painting, la, vie, 1903, now, in, the, cleveland, museum, of, art, the, same, mood, pervades, the, well, known, etching, the, frugal, repast, 1904, which, depicts, a, blind, man, and, a, sighted, woman, both, emaciated, seated, at, a, nearly, bare, table, blindness, a, recurrent, theme, in, picasso, s, works, of, this, period, is, also, represented, in, the, blindman, s, meal, 1903, the, metropolitan, museum, of, art, and, in, the, portrait, of, celestina, 1903, other, blue, period, works, include, portrait, of, soler, and, portrait, of, suzanne, bloch, the, rose, period, 1904, 1906, is, characterized, by, a, lighter, tone, and, style, utilizing, orange, and, pink, colours, and, featuring, many, circus, people, acrobats, and, harlequins, known, in, france, as, saltimbanques, the, harlequin, a, comedic, character, usually, depicted, in, checkered, patterned, clothing, became, a, personal, symbol, for, picasso, picasso, met, fernande, olivier, a, bohemian, artist, who, became, his, mistress, in, paris, in, 1904, olivier, appears, in, many, of, his, rose, period, paintings, many, of, which, are, influenced, by, his, warm, relationship, with, her, in, addition, to, his, increased, exposure, to, french, painting, the, generally, upbeat, and, optimistic, mood, of, paintings, in, this, period, is, reminiscent, of, the, 1899, 1901, period, i, e, just, prior, to, the, blue, period, and, 1904, can, be, considered, a, transition, year, between, the, two, periods, by, 1905, picasso, became, a, favourite, of, american, art, collectors, leo, and, gertrude, stein, their, older, brother, michael, stein, and, his, wife, sarah, also, became, collectors, of, his, work, picasso, painted, a, portrait, of, gertrude, stein, and, one, of, her, nephew, allan, stein, gertrude, stein, became, picasso, s, principal, patron, acquiring, his, drawings, and, paintings, and, exhibiting, them, in, her, informal, salon, at, her, home, in, paris, at, one, of, her, gatherings, in, 1905, he, met, henri, matisse, who, was, to, become, a, lifelong, friend, and, rival, the, steins, introduced, him, to, claribel, cone, and, her, sister, etta, who, were, american, art, collectors, they, also, began, to, acquire, picasso, s, and, matisse, s, paintings, eventually, leo, stein, moved, to, italy, michael, and, sarah, stein, became, patrons, of, matisse, while, gertrude, stein, continued, to, collect, picassos, in, 1907, picasso, joined, an, art, gallery, that, had, recently, been, opened, in, paris, by, daniel, henry, kahnweiler, a, german, art, historian, and, art, collector, who, became, one, of, the, premier, french, art, dealers, of, the, 20th, century, he, was, among, the, first, champions, of, pablo, picasso, georges, braque, and, the, cubism, that, they, jointly, developed, kahnweiler, promoted, burgeoning, artists, such, as, andr, derain, kees, van, dongen, fernand, l, ger, juan, gris, maurice, de, vlaminck, and, several, others, who, had, come, from, all, over, the, globe, to, live, and, work, in, montparnasse, at, the, time, picasso, s, african, influenced, period, 1907, 1909, begins, with, his, painting, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, the, three, figures, on, the, left, were, inspired, by, iberian, sculpture, but, he, repainted, the, faces, of, the, two, figures, on, the, right, after, being, powerfully, impressed, by, african, artefacts, he, saw, in, june, 1907, in, the, ethnographic, museum, at, palais, du, trocad, ro, when, he, displayed, the, painting, to, acquaintances, in, his, studio, later, that, year, the, nearly, universal, reaction, was, shock, and, revulsion, matisse, angrily, dismissed, the, work, as, a, hoax, picasso, did, not, exhibit, les, demoiselles, publicly, until, 1916, other, works, from, this, period, include, nude, with, raised, arms, 1907, and, three, women, 1908, formal, ideas, developed, during, this, period, lead, directly, into, the, cubist, period, that, follows, analytic, cubism, 1909, 1912, is, a, style, of, painting, picasso, developed, with, georges, braque, using, monochrome, brownish, and, neutral, colours, both, artists, took, apart, objects, and, analyzed, them, in, terms, of, their, shapes, picasso, and, braque, s, paintings, at, this, time, share, many, similarities, in, paris, picasso, entertained, a, distinguished, coterie, of, friends, in, the, montmartre, and, montparnasse, quarters, including, andr, breton, poet, guillaume, apollinaire, writer, alfred, jarry, and, gertrude, stein, in, 1911, picasso, was, arrested, and, questioned, about, the, theft, of, the, mona, lisa, from, the, louvre, suspicion, for, the, crime, had, initially, fallen, upon, apollinaire, due, to, his, links, to, g, ry, pieret, an, artist, with, a, history, of, thefts, from, the, gallery, apollinaire, in, turn, implicated, his, close, friend, picasso, who, had, also, purchased, stolen, artworks, from, the, artist, in, the, past, afraid, of, a, conviction, that, could, result, in, his, deportation, to, spain, picasso, denied, having, ever, met, apollinaire, both, were, later, cleared, of, any, involvement, in, the, painting, s, disappearance, synthetic, cubism, 1912, 1919, was, a, further, development, of, the, genre, of, cubism, in, which, cut, paper, fragments, often, wallpaper, or, portions, of, newspaper, pages, were, pasted, into, compositions, marking, the, first, use, of, collage, in, fine, art, between, 1915, and, 1917, picasso, began, a, series, of, paintings, depicting, highly, geometric, and, minimalist, cubist, objects, consisting, of, either, a, pipe, a, guitar, or, a, glass, with, an, occasional, element, of, collage, hard, edged, square, cut, diamonds, notes, art, historian, john, richardson, these, gems, do, not, always, have, upside, or, downside, we, need, a, new, name, to, designate, them, wrote, picasso, to, gertrude, stein, the, term, crystal, cubism, was, later, used, as, a, result, of, visual, analogies, with, crystals, at, the, time, these, little, gems, may, have, been, produced, by, picasso, in, response, to, critics, who, had, claimed, his, defection, from, the, movement, through, his, experimentation, with, classicism, within, the, so, called, return, to, order, following, the, war, after, acquiring, some, fame, and, fortune, picasso, left, olivier, for, marcelle, humbert, also, known, as, eva, gouel, picasso, included, declarations, of, his, love, for, eva, in, many, cubist, works, picasso, was, devastated, by, her, premature, death, from, illness, at, the, age, of, 30, in, 1915, at, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, in, august, 1914, picasso, was, living, in, avignon, braque, and, derain, were, mobilized, and, apollinaire, joined, the, french, artillery, while, the, spaniard, juan, gris, remained, from, the, cubist, circle, during, the, war, picasso, was, able, to, continue, painting, uninterrupted, unlike, his, french, comrades, his, paintings, became, more, sombre, and, his, life, changed, with, dramatic, consequences, kahnweiler, s, contract, had, terminated, on, his, exile, from, france, at, this, point, picasso, s, work, would, be, taken, on, by, the, art, dealer, l, once, rosenberg, after, the, loss, of, eva, gouel, picasso, had, an, affair, with, gaby, lespinasse, during, the, spring, of, 1916, apollinaire, returned, from, the, front, wounded, they, renewed, their, friendship, but, picasso, began, to, frequent, new, social, circles, towards, the, end, of, world, war, i, picasso, became, involved, with, serge, diaghilev, s, ballets, russes, among, his, friends, during, this, period, were, jean, cocteau, jean, hugo, juan, gris, and, others, in, the, summer, of, 1918, picasso, married, olga, khokhlova, a, ballerina, with, sergei, diaghilev, s, troupe, for, whom, picasso, was, designing, a, ballet, erik, satie, s, parade, in, rome, they, spent, their, honeymoon, near, biarritz, in, the, villa, of, glamorous, chilean, art, patron, eugenia, err, zuriz, khokhlova, introduced, picasso, to, high, society, formal, dinner, parties, and, other, dimensions, of, the, life, of, the, rich, in, 1920s, paris, the, two, had, a, son, paulo, picasso, who, would, grow, up, to, be, a, motorcycle, racer, and, chauffeur, to, his, father, khokhlova, s, insistence, on, social, propriety, clashed, with, picasso, s, bohemian, tendencies, and, the, two, lived, in, a, state, of, constant, conflict, during, the, same, period, that, picasso, collaborated, with, diaghilev, s, troupe, he, and, igor, stravinsky, collaborated, on, pulcinella, in, 1920, picasso, took, the, opportunity, to, make, several, drawings, of, the, composer, in, 1927, picasso, met, 17, year, old, marie, th, r, se, walter, and, began, a, secret, affair, with, her, picasso, s, marriage, to, khokhlova, soon, ended, in, separation, rather, than, divorce, as, french, law, required, an, even, division, of, property, in, the, case, of, divorce, and, picasso, did, not, want, khokhlova, to, have, half, his, wealth, the, two, remained, legally, married, until, khokhlova, s, death, in, 1955, picasso, carried, on, a, long, standing, affair, with, marie, th, r, se, walter, and, fathered, a, daughter, with, her, named, maya, marie, th, r, se, lived, in, the, vain, hope, that, picasso, would, one, day, marry, her, and, hanged, herself, four, years, after, picasso, s, death, in, february, 1917, picasso, made, his, first, trip, to, italy, in, the, period, following, the, upheaval, of, world, war, i, picasso, produced, work, in, a, neoclassical, style, this, return, to, order, is, evident, in, the, work, of, many, european, artists, in, the, 1920s, including, andr, derain, giorgio, de, chirico, gino, severini, jean, metzinger, the, artists, of, the, new, objectivity, movement, and, of, the, novecento, italiano, movement, picasso, s, paintings, and, drawings, from, this, period, frequently, recall, the, work, of, raphael, and, ingres, in, 1925, the, surrealist, writer, and, poet, andr, breton, declared, picasso, as, one, of, ours, in, his, article, le, surr, alisme, et, la, peinture, published, in, r, volution, surr, aliste, les, demoiselles, was, reproduced, for, the, first, time, in, europe, in, the, same, issue, yet, picasso, exhibited, cubist, works, at, the, first, surrealist, group, exhibition, in, 1925, the, concept, of, psychic, automatism, in, its, pure, state, defined, in, the, manifeste, du, surr, alisme, never, appealed, to, him, entirely, he, did, at, the, time, develop, new, imagery, and, formal, syntax, for, expressing, himself, emotionally, releasing, the, violence, the, psychic, fears, and, the, eroticism, that, had, been, largely, contained, or, sublimated, since, 1909, writes, art, historian, melissa, mcquillan, although, this, transition, in, picasso, s, work, was, informed, by, cubism, for, its, spatial, relations, the, fusion, of, ritual, and, abandon, in, the, imagery, recalls, the, primitivism, of, the, demoiselles, and, the, elusive, psychological, resonances, of, his, symbolist, work, writes, mcquillan, surrealism, revived, picasso, s, attraction, to, primitivism, and, eroticism, during, the, 1930s, the, minotaur, replaced, the, harlequin, as, a, common, motif, in, his, work, his, use, of, the, minotaur, came, partly, from, his, contact, with, the, surrealists, who, often, used, it, as, their, symbol, and, it, appears, in, picasso, s, guernica, the, minotaur, and, picasso, s, mistress, marie, th, r, se, walter, are, heavily, featured, in, his, celebrated, vollard, suite, of, etchings, arguably, picasso, s, most, famous, work, is, his, depiction, of, the, german, bombing, of, guernica, during, the, spanish, civil, war, guernica, this, large, canvas, embodies, for, many, the, inhumanity, brutality, and, hopelessness, of, war, asked, to, explain, its, symbolism, picasso, said, it, isn, t, up, to, the, painter, to, define, the, symbols, otherwise, it, would, be, better, if, he, wrote, them, out, in, so, many, words, the, public, who, look, at, the, picture, must, interpret, the, symbols, as, they, understand, them, guernica, was, exhibited, in, july, 1937, at, the, spanish, pavilion, at, the, paris, international, exposition, and, then, became, the, centrepiece, of, an, exhibition, of, 118, works, by, picasso, matisse, braque, and, henri, laurens, that, toured, scandinavia, and, england, after, the, victory, of, francisco, franco, in, spain, the, painting, was, sent, to, the, united, states, to, raise, funds, and, support, for, spanish, refugees, until, 1981, it, was, entrusted, to, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, in, new, york, city, as, it, was, picasso, s, expressed, desire, that, the, painting, should, not, be, delivered, to, spain, until, liberty, and, democracy, had, been, established, in, the, country, before, guernica, picasso, had, never, addressed, political, themes, in, his, art, the, politicized, nature, of, the, work, is, largely, attributed, to, his, romantic, relationship, at, the, time, with, the, french, anti, fascist, activist, and, surrealist, photographer, dora, maar, in, addition, her, black, and, white, photographs, are, likely, to, have, influenced, the, black, and, white, scheme, of, guernica, in, stark, contrast, to, picasso, s, usual, colorful, paintings, maar, s, practice, of, photography, influenced, the, art, of, picasso, she, had, a, great, influence, on, his, work, said, antoine, romand, a, dora, maar, expert, she, contested, him, she, pushed, him, to, do, something, new, and, to, be, more, creative, politically, maar, had, exclusive, access, to, picasso, s, studio, to, observe, and, photograph, the, creation, of, guernica, at, picasso, s, request, maar, painted, parts, of, the, dying, horse, in, 1939, and, 1940, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, city, under, its, director, alfred, barr, a, picasso, enthusiast, held, a, major, retrospective, of, picasso, s, principal, works, until, that, time, this, exhibition, lionized, picasso, brought, into, full, public, view, in, america, the, scope, of, his, artistry, and, resulted, in, a, reinterpretation, of, his, work, by, contemporary, art, historians, and, scholars, according, to, jonathan, weinberg, given, the, extraordinary, quality, of, the, show, and, picasso, s, enormous, prestige, generally, heightened, by, the, political, impact, of, guernica, the, critics, were, surprisingly, ambivalent, picasso, s, multiplicity, of, styles, was, disturbing, to, one, journalist, another, described, him, as, wayward, and, even, malicious, alfred, frankenstein, s, review, in, artnews, concluded, that, picasso, was, both, charlatan, and, genius, during, world, war, ii, picasso, remained, in, paris, while, the, germans, occupied, the, city, picasso, s, artistic, style, did, not, fit,

sometimes, the, location, of, where, they, were, written, for, example, paris, 16, may, 1936, these, works, were, gustatory, erotic, and, at, times, scatological, as, were, his, two, full, length,

with, women, of, an, even, greater, age, disparity, than, his, and, gilot, s, while, still, involved, with, gilot, in, 1951, picasso, had, a, six, week, affair, with, genevi, ve, laporte, who, was, four, years, younger, than, gilot, by, his, 70s, many, paintings, ink, drawings, and, prints, have, as, their, theme, an, old, grotesque, dwarf, as, the, doting, lover, of, a, beautiful, young, model, jacqueline, roque, 1927, 1986, worked, at, the, madoura, pottery, in, vallauris, on, the, french, riviera, where, picasso, made, and, painted, ceramics, she, became, his, lover, and, then, his, second, wife, in, 1961, the, two, were, together, for, the, remainder, of, picasso, s, life, his, marriage, to, roque, was, also, a, means, of, revenge, against, gilot, with, picasso, s, encouragement, gilot, had, divorced, her, then, husband, luc, simon, with, the, plan, to, marry, picasso, to, secure, the, rights, of, her, children, as, picasso, s, legitimate, heirs, picasso, had,

he, was, an, international, celebrity, with, often, as, much, interest, in, his, personal, life, as, his, art, picasso, was, one, of, 250, sculptors, who, exhibited, in, the, 3rd, sculpture, international, held, at, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, in, mid, 1949, in, the, 1950s, picasso, s, style, changed, once, again, as, he, took, to, producing, reinterpretations, of, the, art, of, the, great, masters, he, made, a, series, of, works, based, on, vel, zquez, s, painting, of, las, meninas, he, also, based, paintings, on, works, by, goya, poussin, manet, courbet, and, delacroix, in,

public, sculpture, to, be, built, in, chicago, known, usually, as, the, chicago, picasso, he, approached, the, project, with, a, great, deal, of, enthusiasm, designing, a, sculpture, which, was, ambiguous, and, somewhat, controversial, picasso, said, the, figure, represented, the, head, of, an, afghan, hound, named, kabul, the, sculpture, one, of, the, most, recognizable, landmarks, in, downtown, chicago, was, unveiled, in, 1967, picasso, refused, to, be, paid, 100, 000, for, it, donating, it, to, the, people, of, the, city, picasso, s, final, works, were, a, mixture, of, styles, his, means, of, expression, in, constant, flux, until, the, end, of, his, life, devoting, his, full, energies, to, his, work, picasso, became, more, daring, his, works, more, colourful, and, expressive, and, from, 1968, to, 1971, he, produced, a, torrent, of, paintings, and, hundreds, of, copperplate, etchings, at, the, time, these, works, were, dismissed, by, most, as, pornographic, fantasies, of, an, impotent, old, man, or, the, slapdash, works, of, an, artist, who, was, past, his, prime, only, later, after, picasso, s, death, when, the, rest, of, the, art, world, had, moved, on, from, abstract, expressionism, did, the, critical, community, come, to, see, the, late, works, of, picasso, as, prefiguring, neo, expressionism, pablo, picasso, died, on, 8, april, 1973, in, mougins, france, from, pulmonary, edema, and, a, heart, attack, the, morning, after, he, and, his, wife, jacqueline, entertained, friends, for, dinner, he, was, interred, at, the, ch, teau, of,

from, the, catalan, independence, movement, during, his, youth, despite, expressing, general, support, and, being, friendly, with, activists, within, it, he, did, not, join, the, armed, forces, for, any, side, or, country, during, world, war, i, the, spanish, civil, war, or, world, war, ii, as, a, spanish, citizen, living, in, france, picasso, was, under, no, compulsion, to, fight, against, the, invading, germans, in, either, world, war, in, 1940, he, applied, for, french, citizenship, but, it, was, refused, on, the, grounds, of, his, extremist, ideas, evolving, towards, communism, this, information, was, not, revealed, until, 2003, at, the, start, of, the, spanish, civil, war, in, 1936, picasso, was, 54, years, of, age, soon, after, hostilities, began, the, republicans, appointed, him, director, of, the, prado, albeit, in, absentia, and, he, took, his, duties, very, seriously, according, to, john, richardson, supplying, the, funds, to, evacuate, the, museum, s, collection, to, geneva, the, war, provided, the, impetus, for, picasso, s, first, overtly, political, work, he, expressed, anger, and, condemnation, of, francisco, franco, and, fascists, in, the, dream, and, lie, of, franco, 1937, which, was, produced, specifically, for, propagandistic, and, fundraising, purposes, this, surreal, fusion, of, words, and, images, was, intended, to, be, sold, as, a, series, of, postcards, to, raise, funds, for, the, spanish, republican, cause, in, 1944, picasso, joined, the, french, communist, party, he, attended, the, 1948, world, congress, of, intellectuals, in, defense, of, peace, in, poland, and, in, 1950, received, the, stalin, peace, prize, from, the, soviet, government, a, portrait, of, joseph, stalin, made, by, picasso, in, 1953, drew, party, criticism, due, to, being, insufficiently, realistic, though, he, remained, a, loyal, member, of, the, communist, party, until, his, death, his, dealer, d, h, kahnweiler, a, socialist, termed, picasso, s, communism, sentimental, rather, than, political, saying, he, has, never, read, a, line, of, karl, marx, nor, of, engels, of, course, in, a, 1945, interview, with, jerome, seckler, picasso, stated, i, am, a, communist, and, my, painting, is, communist, painting, but, if, i, were, a, shoemaker, royalist, or, communist, or, anything, else, i, would, not, necessarily, hammer, my, shoes, in, a, special, way, to, show, my, politics, his, commitment, to, communism, common, among, continental, intellectuals, and, artists, at, the, time, has, long, been, the, subject, of, some, controversy, a, notable, demonstration, thereof, was, a, quote, by, salvador, dal, with, whom, picasso, had, a, rather, strained, relationship, picasso, es, pintor, yo, tambi, n, picasso, es, espa, ol, yo, tambi, n, picasso, es, comunista, yo, tampoco, picasso, is, a, painter, so, am, i, picasso, is, a, spaniard, so, am, i, picasso, is, a, communist, neither, am, i, in, the, late, 1940s, his, old, friend, surrealist, poet, andr, breton, who, was, a, trotskyist, and, anti, stalinist, was, more, blunt, refusing, to, shake, hands, with, picasso, he, told, him, i, don, t, approve, of, your, joining, the, communist, party, nor, with, the, stand, you, have, taken, concerning, the, purges, of, the, intellectuals, after, the, liberation, as, a, communist, picasso, opposed, the, intervention, of, the, united, nations, and, the, united, states, in, the, korean, war, and, depicted, it, in, massacre, in, korea, the, art, critic, kirsten, hoving, keen, wrote, that, it, was, inspired, by, reports, of, american, atrocities, and, considered, it, one, of, picasso, s, communist, works, on, 9, january, 1949, picasso, created, dove, a, black, and, white, lithograph, it, was, used, to, illustrate, a, poster, at, the, 1949, world, peace, council, and, became, an, iconographic, image, of, the, period, known, as, the, dove, of, peace, picasso, s, image, was, used, around, the, world, as, a, symbol, of, the, peace, congresses, and, communism, in, 1962, he, received, the, lenin, peace, prize, biographer, and, art, critic, john, berger, felt, his, talents, as, an, artist, were, wasted, by, the, communists, according, to, jean, cocteau, s, diaries, picasso, once, said, to, him, in, reference, to, the, communists, i, have, joined, a, family, and, like, all, families, it, s, full, of, shit, picasso, was, exceptionally, prolific, throughout, his, long, lifetime, at, his, death, there, were, more, than, 45, 000, unsold, works, in, his, estate, comprising, 1, 885, paintings, 1, 228, sculptures, 3, 222, ceramics, 7, 089, drawings, 150, sketchbooks, many, thousands, of, prints, and, numerous, tapestries, and, rugs, the, most, complete, but, not, exhaustive, catalogue, of, his, works, the, catalogue, raisonn, compiled, by, christian, zervos, lists, more, than, 16, 000, paintings, and, drawings, picasso, s, output, was, several, times, more, prolific, than, most, artists, of, his, era, by, at, least, one, account, american, artist, bob, ross, is, the, only, one, to, rival, picasso, s, volume, and, ross, s, artwork, was, designed, specifically, to, be, easily, mass, produced, quickly, the, medium, in, which, picasso, made, his, most, important, contribution, was, painting, in, his, paintings, picasso, used, colour, as, an, expressive, element, but, relied, on, drawing, rather, than, subtleties, of, colour, to, create, form, and, space, he, sometimes, added, sand, to, his, paint, to, vary, its, texture, a, nanoprobe, of, picasso, s, the, red, armchair, 1931, in, the, collection, of, the, art, institute, of, chicago, by, physicists, at, argonne, national, laboratory, in, 2012, confirmed, art, historians, belief, that, picasso, used, common, house, paint, in, many, of, his, paintings, much, of, his, painting, was, done, at, night, by, artificial, light, picasso, s, early, sculptures, were, carved, from, wood, or, modelled, in, wax, or, clay, but, from, 1909, to, 1928, picasso, abandoned, modelling, and, instead, made, sculptural, constructions, using, diverse, materials, an, example, is, guitar, 1912, a, relief, construction, made, of, sheet, metal, and, wire, that, jane, fluegel, terms, a, three, dimensional, planar, counterpart, of, cubist, painting, that, marks, a, revolutionary, departure, from, the, traditional, approaches, modeling, and, carving, from, the, beginning, of, his, career, picasso, displayed, an, interest, in, subject, matter, of, every, kind, and, demonstrated, a, great, stylistic, versatility, that, enabled, him, to, work, in, several, styles, at, once, for, example, his, paintings, of, 1917, included, the, pointillist, woman, with, a, mantilla, the, cubist, figure, in, an, armchair, and, the, naturalistic, harlequin, all, in, the, museu, picasso, barcelona, in, 1919, he, made, a, number, of, drawings, from, postcards, and, photographs, that, reflect, his, interest, in, the, stylistic, conventions, and, static, character, of, posed, photographs, in, 1921, he, simultaneously, painted, several, large, neoclassical, paintings, and, two, versions, of, the, cubist, composition, three, musicians, museum, of, modern, art, new, york, philadelphia, museum, of, art, in, an, interview, published, in, 1923, picasso, said, the, several, manners, i, have, used, in, my, art, must, not, be, considered, as, an, evolution, or, as, steps, towards, an, unknown, ideal, of, painting, if, the, subjects, i, have, wanted, to, express, have, suggested, different, ways, of, expression, i, have, never, hesitated, to, adopt, them, although, his, cubist, works, approach, abstraction, picasso, never, relinquished, the, objects, of, the, real, world, as, subject, matter, prominent, in, his, cubist, paintings, are, forms, easily, recognized, as, guitars, violins, and, bottles, when, picasso, depicted, complex, narrative, scenes, it, was, usually, in, prints, drawings, and, small, scale, works, guernica, 1937, is, one, of, his, few, large, narrative, paintings, picasso, painted, mostly, from, imagination, or, memory, according, to, william, rubin, picasso, could, only, make, great, art, from, subjects, that, truly, involved, him, unlike, matisse, picasso, had, eschewed, models, virtually, all, his, mature, life, preferring, to, paint, individuals, whose, lives, had, both, impinged, on, and, had, real, significance, for, his, own, the, art, critic, arthur, danto, said, picasso, s, work, constitutes, a, vast, pictorial, autobiography, that, provides, some, basis, for, the, popular, conception, that, picasso, invented, a, new, style, each, time, he, fell, in, love, with, a, new, woman, the, autobiographical, nature, of, picasso, s, art, is, reinforced, by, his, habit, of, dating, his, works, often, to, the, day, he, explained, i, want, to, leave, to, posterity, a, documentation, that, will, be, as, complete, as, possible, that, s, why, i, put, a, date, on, everything, i, do, picasso, s, influence, was, and, remains, immense, and, widely, acknowledged, by, his, admirers, and, detractors, alike, on, the, occasion, of, his, 1939, retrospective, at, moma, life, magazine, wrote, during, the, 25, years, he, has, dominated, modern, european, art, his, enemies, say, he, has, been, a, corrupting, influence, with, equal, violence, his, friends, say, he, is, the, greatest, artist, alive, picasso, was, the, first, artist, to, receive, a, special, honour, exhibition, at, the, grand, gallery, of, the, louvre, museum, in, paris, in, celebration, of, his, 90, years, in, 1998, robert, hughes, wrote, of, him, to, say, that, pablo, picasso, dominated, western, art, in, the, 20th, century, is, by, now, the, merest, commonplace, no, painter, or, sculptor, not, even, michelangelo, had, been, as, famous, as, this, in, his, own, lifetime, though, marcel, duchamp, that, cunning, old, fox, of, conceptual, irony, has, certainly, had, more, influence, on, nominally, vanguard, art, over, the, past, 30, years, than, picasso, the, spaniard, was, the, last, great, beneficiary, of, the, belief, that, the, language, of, painting, and, sculpture, really, mattered, to, people, other, than, their, devotees, at, the, time, of, picasso, s, death, many, of, his, paintings, were, in, his, possession, as, he, had, kept, off, the, art, market, what, he, did, not, need, to, sell, in, addition, picasso, had, a, considerable, collection, of, the, work, of, other, famous, artists, some, his, contemporaries, such, as, henri, matisse, with, whom, he, had, exchanged, works, since, picasso, left, no, will, his, death, duties, estate, tax, to, the, french, state, were, paid, in, the, form, of, his, works, and, others, from, his, collection, these, works, form, the, core, of, the, immense, and, representative, collection, of, the, mus, e, picasso, in, paris, in, 2003, relatives, of, picasso, inaugurated, a, museum, dedicated, to, him, in, his, birthplace, m, laga, spain, the, museo, picasso,

been, scrapped, due, to, the, fact, that, catherine, hutin, blay, jacqueline, picasso, s, daughter, and, the, city, council, had, failed, to, reach, an, agreement, in, the, 1996, movie, surviving,
