remark, about, his, bright, clothing, rich, friends, and, love, of, pleasures, his, displays, of, disillusionment, toward, the, world, that, surrounded, him, came, fairly, early, in, his, life, as, is, shown, in, the, story, of, the, beggar, in, this, account, he, was, selling, cloth, and, velvet, in, the, marketplace, on, behalf, of, his, father, when, a, beggar, came, to, him, and, asked, for,

he, took, this, to, mean, the, ruined, church, in, which, he, was, presently, praying, and, so, he, sold, some, cloth, from, his, father, s, store, to, assist, the, priest, there, when, the, priest, refused, to, accept, the, ill, gotten, gains, an, indignant, francis, threw, the, coins, on, the, floor, in, order, to, avoid, his, father, s, wrath, francis, hid, in, a, cave, near, san, damiano, for, about, a, month, when, he, returned, to, town, hungry, and, dirty, he, was, dragged, home, by, his, father, beaten, bound, and, locked, in, a, small, storeroom, freed, by, his, mother, during, bernardone, s, absence, francis, returned, at, once, to, san, damiano, where, he, found, shelter, with, the, officiating, priest, but, he, was, soon, cited, before, the, city, consuls, by, his, father, the, latter, not, content, with, having, recovered, the, scattered, gold, from, san, damiano, sought, also, to, force, his, son, to, forego, his, inheritance, by, way, of, restitution, in, the, midst, of, legal, proceedings, before, the, bishop, of, assisi, francis, renounced, his, father, and, his, patrimony, some, accounts, report, that, he, stripped, himself, naked, in, token, of, this, renunciation, and, the, bishop, covered, him, with, his, own, cloak, for, the, next, couple, of, months, francis, wandered, as, a, beggar, in, the, hills, behind, assisi, he, spent, some, time, at, a, neighbouring, monastery, working, as, a, scullion, he, then, went, to, gubbio, where, a, friend, gave, him, as, an, alms, the, cloak, girdle, and, staff, of, a, pilgrim, returning, to, assisi, he, traversed, the, city, begging, stones, for, the, restoration, of, st, damiano, these, he, carried, to, the, old, chapel, set, in, place, himself, and, so, at, length, rebuilt, it, over, the, course, of, two, years, he, embraced, the, life, of, a, penitent, during, which, he, restored, several, ruined, chapels, in, the, countryside, around, assisi, among, them, san, pietro, in, spina, in, the, area, of, san, petrignano, in, the, valley, about, a, kilometre, from, rivotorto, today, on, private, property, and, once, again, in, ruin, and, the, porziuncola, the, little, chapel, of, st, mary, of, the, angels, in, the, plain, just, below, the, town, this, later, became, his, favorite, abode, by, degrees, he, took, to, nursing, lepers, in, the, leper, colonies, near, assisi, one, morning, in, february, 1208, francis, was, taking, part, in, a, mass, in, the, chapel, of, st, mary, of, the, angels, near, which, he, had, by, then, built, himself, a, hut, the, gospel, of, the, day, was, the, commissioning, of, the, twelve, from, the, book, of, matthew, the, disciples, were, to, go, and, proclaim, that, the, kingdom, of, god, is, at, hand, francis, was, inspired, to, devote, himself, to, a, life, of, poverty, having, obtained, a, coarse, woollen, tunic, the, dress, then, worn, by, the, poorest, umbrian, peasants, he, tied, it, around, himself, with, a, knotted, rope, and, went, about, exhorting, the, people, of, the, countryside, to, penance, brotherly, love, and, peace, francis, s, preaching, to, ordinary, people, was, unusual, as, he, had, no, license, to, do, so, his, example, attracted, others, within, a, year, francis, had, eleven, followers, the, brothers, lived, a, simple, life, in, the, deserted, leper, colony, of, rivo, torto, near, assisi, they, spent, much, of, their, time, wandering, through, the, mountainous, districts, of, umbria, making, a, deep, impression, upon, their, hearers, by, their, earnest, exhortations, in, 1209, he, composed, a, simple, rule, for, his, followers, friars, the, regula, primitiva, or, primitive, rule, which, came, from, verses, in, the, bible, the, rule, was, to, follow, the, teachings, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, and, to, walk, in, his, footsteps, he, then, led, eleven, followers, to, rome, to, seek, permission, from, pope, innocent, iii, to, found, a, new, religious, order, upon, entry, to, rome, the, brothers, encountered, bishop, guido, of, assisi, who, had, in, his, company, giovanni, di, san, paolo, the, cardinal, bishop, of, sabina, the, cardinal, who, was, the, confessor, of, pope, innocent, iii, was, immediately, sympathetic, to, francis, and, agreed, to, represent, francis, to, the, pope, after, several, days, the, pope, agreed, to, admit, the, group, informally, adding, that, when, god, increased, the, group, in, grace, and, number, they, could, return, for, an, official, audience, the, group, was, tonsured, this, was, important, in, part, because, it, recognized, church, authority, and, prevented, his, following, from, accusations, of, heresy, as, had, happened, to, the, waldensians, decades, earlier, though, a, number, of, the, pope, s, counsellors, considered, the, mode, of, life, proposed, by, francis, to, be, unsafe, and, impractical, following, a, dream, in, which, he, saw, francis, holding, up, the, lateran, basilica, he, decided, to, endorse, francis, s, order, this, occurred, according, to, tradition, on, 16, april, 1210, and, constituted, the, official, founding, of, the, franciscan, order, the, group, then, the, lesser, brothers, order, of, friars, minor, also, known, as, the, franciscan, order, or, the, seraphic, order, were, centred, in, the, porziuncola, and, preached, first, in, umbria, before, expanding, throughout, italy, francis, was, later, ordained, a, deacon, but, not, a, priest, from, then, on, the, new, order, grew, quickly, hearing, francis, preaching, in, the, church, of, san, rufino, in, assisi, in, 1211, the, young, noblewoman, clare, of, assisi, sought, to, live, like, them, her, cousin, rufino, also, sought, to, join, on, the, night, of, palm, sunday, 28, march, 1212, clare, clandestinely, left, her, family, s, palace, francis, received, her, at, the, porziuncola, and, thereby, established, the, order, of, poor, clares, he, gave, clare, a, religious, habit, a, garment, similar, to, his, own, before, lodging, her, her, younger, sister, caterina, and, other, young, women, in, a, nearby, monastery, of, benedictine, nuns, until, he, could, provide, a, suitable, monastery, later, he, transferred, them, to, san, damiano, to, a, few, small, huts, or, cells, this, became, the, first, monastery, of, the, second, franciscan, order, now, known, as, poor, clares, for, those, who, could, not, leave, their, affairs, francis, later, formed, the, third, order, of, brothers, and, sisters, of, penance, a, fraternity, composed, of, either, laity, or, clergy, whose, members, neither, withdrew, from, the, world, nor, took, religious, vows, instead, they, observed, the, principles, of, franciscan, life, in, their, daily, lives, before, long, the, third, order, now, titled, the, secular, franciscan, order, grew, beyond, italy, determined, to, bring, the, gospel, to, all, peoples, and, let, god, convert, them, francis, sought, on, several, occasions, to, take, his, message, out, of, italy, in, approximately, 1211, a, captain, of, the, medrano, family, held, the, lordship, of, the, castle, and, town, of, agoncillo, situated, near, the, city, of, logro, o, in, the, region, of, la, rioja, spain, medrano, s, son, was, suffering, from, a, mysterious, and, untreatable, ailment, in, 1211, saint, francis, of, assisi, roamed, those, very, paths, of, agoncillo, in, a, saintly, manner, he, visited, medrano, s, agoncillo, castle, placed, his, mystical, hands, upon, the, ailing, medrano, boy, and, miraculously, healed, him, securing, the, medrano, lineage, in, agoncillo, as, a, result, the, medrano, family, are, distinguished, by, their, devotion, to, saint, francis, of, assisi, the, medrano, family, generously, donated, some, land, including, a, tower, situated, close, to, the, ebro, river, within, the, city, of, logro, o, as, a, gift, to, saint, francis, where, he, established, the, first, spanish, convent, of, his, order, there, unfortunately, despite, its, centuries, long, legacy, of, glory, and, sanctity, the, convent, met, its, demise, in, the, 19th, century, today, the, remnants, of, its, walls, still, remain, in, the, late, spring, of, 1212, he, set, out, for, jerusalem, but, was, shipwrecked, by, a, storm, on, the, dalmatian, coast, forcing, him, to, return, to, italy, on, 8, may, 1213, he, was, given, the, use, of, the, mountain, of, la, verna, alverna, as, a, gift, from, count, orlando, di, chiusi, who, described, it, as, eminently, suitable, for, whoever, wishes, to, do, penance, in, a, place, remote, from, mankind, the, mountain, would, become, one, of, his, favourite, retreats, for, prayer, in, the, same, year, francis, sailed, for, morocco, but, an, illness, forced, him, to, break, off, his, journey, while, in, spain, during, the, fifth, crusade, in, 1219, francis, went, to, egypt, where, a, crusader, army, had, been, encamped, for, over, a, year, besieging, the, walled, city, of, damietta, he, was, accompanied, by, friar, illuminatus, of, arce, and, hoped, to, convert, the, sultan, of, egypt, or, be, martyred, in, the, attempt, the, sultan, al, kamil, a, nephew, of, saladin, had, succeeded, his, father, as, sultan, of, egypt, in, 1218, and, was, encamped, upstream, of, damietta, a, bloody, and, futile, attack, on, the, city, was, launched, by, the, christians, on, 29, august, 1219, following, which, both, sides, agreed, to, a, ceasefire, that, lasted, four, weeks, probably, during, this, interlude, francis, and, his, companion, crossed, the, muslims, lines, and, were, brought, before, the, sultan, remaining, in, his, camp, for, a, few, days, reports, give, no, information, about, what, transpired, during, the, encounter, beyond, noting, that, the, sultan, received, francis, graciously, and, that, francis, preached, to, the, muslims, he, returned, unharmed, no, known, arab, sources, mention, the, visit, such, an, incident, is, alluded, to, in, a, scene, in, the, late, 13th, century, fresco, cycle, attributed, to, giotto, in, the, upper, basilica, at, assisi, according, to, some, late, sources, the, sultan, gave, francis, permission, to, visit, the, sacred, places, in, the, holy, land, and, even, to, preach, there, all, that, can, safely, be, asserted, is, that, francis, and, his, companion, left, the, crusader, camp, for, acre, from, where, they, embarked, for, italy, in, the, latter, half, of, 1220, drawing, on, a, 1267, sermon, by, bonaventure, later, sources, report, that, the, sultan, secretly, converted, or, accepted, a, death, bed, baptism, as, a, result, of, meeting, francis, whatever, transpired, as, a, result, of, francis, and, al, kamil, s, meeting, the, franciscans, have, maintained, a, presence, in, the, holy, land, almost, uninterruptedly, since, 1217, and, remain, there, today, see, custody, of, the, holy, land, they, received, concessions, from, the, mameluke, sultan, in, 1333, with, regard, to, certain, holy, places, in, jerusalem, and, bethlehem, and, so, far, as, concerns, the, catholic, church, jurisdictional, privileges, from, pope, clement, vi, in, 1342, the, growing, order, of, friars, was, divided, into, provinces, groups, were, sent, to, france, germany, hungary, and, spain, and, to, the, east, upon, receiving, a, report, of, the, martyrdom, of, five, brothers, in, morocco, francis, returned, to, italy, via, venice, cardinal, ugolino, di, conti, was, then, nominated, by, the, pope, as, the, protector, of, the, order, another, reason, for, francis, return, to, italy, was, that, the, franciscan, order, had, grown, at, an, unprecedented, rate, compared, to, previous, religious, orders, but, its, organizational, sophistication, had, not, kept, up, with, this, growth, and, had, little, more, to, govern, it, than, francis, example, and, simple, rule, to, address, this, problem, francis, prepared, a, new, and, more, detailed, rule, the, first, rule, or, rule, without, a, papal, bull, regula, prima, regula, non, bullata, which, again, asserted, devotion, to, poverty, and, the, apostolic, life, however, it, also, introduced, a, greater, institutional, structure, though, this, was, never, officially, endorsed, by, the, pope, on, 29, september, 1220, francis, handed, over, the, governance, of, the, order, to, brother, peter, catani, at, the, porziuncola, but, peter, died, only, five, months, later, brother, peter, was, succeeded, by, brother, elias, as, vicar, of, francis, two, years, later, francis, modified, the, first, rule, creating, the, second, rule, or, rule, with, a, bull, which, was, approved, by, pope, honorius, iii, on, 29, november, 1223, as, the, order, s, official, rule, it, called, on, the, friars, to, observe, the, holy, gospel, of, our, lord, jesus, christ, living, in, obedience, without, anything, of, our, own, and, in, chastity, in, addition, it, set, regulations, for, discipline, preaching, and, entering, the, order, once, the, rule, was, endorsed, by, the, pope, francis, withdrew, increasingly, from, external, affairs, during, 1221, and, 1222, he, crossed, italy, first, as, far, south, as, catania, in, sicily, and, afterwards, as, far, north, as, bologna, while, he, was, praying, on, the, mountain, of, verna, during, a, forty, day, fast, in, preparation, for, michaelmas, 29, september, francis, is, said, to, have, had, a, vision, on, or, about, 13, september, 1224, the, feast, of, the, exaltation, of, the, cross, as, a, result, of, which, he, received, the, stigmata, brother, leo, who, had, been, with, francis, at, the, time, left, a, clear, and, simple, account, of, the, event, the, first, definite, account, of, the, phenomenon, of, stigmata, suddenly, he, saw, a, vision, of, a, seraph, a, six, winged, angel, on, a, cross, this, angel, gave, him, the, gift, of, the, five, wounds, of, christ, suffering, from, these, stigmata, and, from, trachoma, francis, received, care, in, several, cities, siena, cortona, nocera, to, no, avail, he, began, to, go, blind, and, the, bishop, of, ostia, ordered, that, his, eyes, be, operated, on, which, meant, cauterizing, the, eyes, with, hot, irons, francis, claims, to, have, felt, nothing, at, all, when, this, was, done, in, the, end, he, was, brought, back, to, a, hut, next, to, the, porziuncola, here, he, spent, his, last, days, dictating, his, spiritual, testament, he, died, on, the, evening, of, saturday, 3, october, 1226, singing, psalm, 141, voce, mea, ad, dominum, on, 16, july, 1228, he, was, declared, a, saint, by, pope, gregory, ix, the, former, cardinal, ugolino, di, conti, a, friend, of, francis, and, cardinal, protector, of, the, order, the, next, day, the, pope, laid, the, foundation, stone, for, the, basilica, of, st, francis, in, assisi, francis, was, buried, on, 25, may, 1230, under, the, lower, basilica, but, his, tomb, was, soon, hidden, on, orders, of, brother, elias, in, order, to, protect, it, from, saracen, invaders, his, burial, place, remained, unknown, until, it, was, rediscovered, in, 1818, pasquale, belli, then, constructed, a, crypt, for, the, remains, in, the, lower, basilica, it, was, refashioned, between, 1927, and, 1930, into, its, present, form, by, ugo, tarchi, in, 1978, the, remains, of, francis, were, examined, and, confirmed, by, a, commission, of, scholars, appointed, by, pope, paul, vi, and, put, into, a, glass, urn, in, the, ancient, stone, tomb, in, 1935, dr, edward, frederick, hartung, concluded, that, francis, contracted, trachoma, while, in, egypt, and, died, of, quartan, malaria, this, data, was, published, in, the, annals, of, medical, history, francis, set, out, to, replicate, christ, and, literally, carry, out, his, work, this, is, important, in, understanding, francis, character, his, affinity, for, the, eucharist, and, his, respect, for, the, priests, who, carried, out, the, sacrament, he, preached, your, god, is, of, your, flesh, he, lives, in, your, nearest, neighbour, in, every, man, he, and, his, followers, celebrated, and, even, venerated, poverty, which, was, so, central, to, his, character, that, in, his, last, written, work, the, testament, he, said, that, absolute, personal, and, corporate, poverty, was, the, essential, lifestyle, for, the, members, of, his, order, he, believed, that, nature, itself, was, the, mirror, of, god, he, called, all, creatures, his, brothers, and, sisters, and, even, preached, to, the, birds, and, supposedly, persuaded, a, wolf, in, gubbio, to, stop, attacking, some, locals, if, they, agreed, to, feed, the, wolf, his, deep, sense, of, brotherhood, under, god, embraced, others, and, he, declared, that, he, considered, himself, no, friend, of, christ, if, he, did, not, cherish, those, for, whom, christ, died, francis, s, visit, to, egypt, and, attempted, rapprochement, with, the, muslim, world, had, far, reaching, consequences, long, past, his, own, death, since, after, the, fall, of, the, crusader, kingdom, it, would, be, the, franciscans, of, all, catholics, who, would, be, allowed, to, stay, on, in, the, holy, land, and, be, recognized, as, custodians, of, the, holy, land, on, behalf, of, the, catholic, church, at, greccio, near, assisi, around, 1220, francis, celebrated, christmas, by, setting, up, the, first, known, presepio, or, cr, che, nativity, scene, his, nativity, imagery, reflected, the, scene, in, traditional, paintings, he, used, real, animals, to, create, a, living, scene, so, that, the, worshipers, could, contemplate, the, birth, of, the, child, jesus, in, a, direct, way, making, use, of, the, senses, especially, sight, both, thomas, of, celano, and, bonaventure, biographers, of, francis, tell, how, he, used, only, a, straw, filled, manger, feeding, trough, set, between, a, real, ox, and, donkey, according, to, thomas, it, was, beautiful, in, its, simplicity, with, the, manger, acting, as, the, altar, for, the, christmas, mass, some, modern, commenters, and, animal, rights, writers, have, mistakenly, described, francis, as, a, vegetarian, historical, texts, show, that, he, did, eat, meat, and, his, earliest, biographers, do, not, mention, him, following, a, meatless, diet, francis, s, favourite, dish, was, shrimp, pie, francis, preached, the, christian, doctrine, that, the, world, was, created, good, and, beautiful, by, god, but, suffers, a, need, for, redemption, because, of, human, sin, as, someone, who, saw, god, reflected, in, nature, st, francis, was, a, great, lover, of, god, s, creation, in, the, canticle, of, the, sun, he, gives, god, thanks, for, brother, sun, sister, moon, brother, wind, water, fire, and, earth, all, of, which, he, sees, as, rendering, praise, to, god, many, of, the, stories, that, surround, the, life, of, francis, say, that, he, had, a, great, love, for, animals, and, the, environment, the, fioretti, little, flowers, is, a, collection, of, legends, and, folklore, that, sprang, up, after, his, death, one, account, describes, how, one, day, while, francis, was, travelling, with, some, companions, they, happened, upon, a, place, in, the, road, where, birds, filled, the, trees, on, either, side, francis, told, his, companions, to, wait, for, me, while, i, go, to, preach, to, my, sisters, the, birds, the, birds, surrounded, him, intrigued, by, the, power, of, his, voice, and, not, one, of, them, flew, away, he, is, often, portrayed, with, a,
