guillaume, de, machaut, french, old, french, also, machau, and, machault, c, 1300, april, 1377, was, a, french, composer, and, poet, who, was, the, central, figure, of, the, ars, nova, style, in, late, medieval, music, his, dominance, of, the, genre, is, such, that, modern, musicologists, use, his, death, to, separate, the, ars, nova, from, the, subsequent, ars, subtilior, movement, regarded, as, the, most, significant, french, composer, and, poet, of, the, 14th, century, he, is, often, seen, as, the, century, s, leading, european, composer, machaut, one, of, the, earliest, european, composers, on, whom, considerable, biographical, information, is, available, has, an, unprecedented, amount, of, surviving, music, in, part, due, to, his, own, involvement, in, his, manuscripts, creation, and, preservation, machaut, embodies, the, culmination, of, the, poet, composer, tradition, stretching, back, to, the, traditions, of, troubadour, and, trouv, re, his, poetry, was, greatly, admired, and, imitated, by, other, poets, including, geoffrey, chaucer, and, eustache, deschamps, well, into, the, 15th, century, machaut, composed, in, a, wide, range, of, styles, and, forms, and, was, crucial, in, developing, the, motet, and, secular, song, forms, particularly, the, lai, and, the, formes, fixes, rondeau, virelai, and, ballade, among, his, only, surviving, sacred, works, messe, de, nostre, dame, is, the, earliest, known, complete, setting, of, the, ordinary, of, the, mass, attributable, to, a, single, composer, other, notable, works, include, the, rondeaux, ma, fin, est, mon, commencement, and, rose, liz, printemps, verdure, as, well, as, the, virelai, douce, dame, jolie, guillaume, de, machaut, was, born, around, 1300, one, of, seven, children, and, educated, in, the, region, around, reims, his, surname, most, likely, derives, from, the, nearby, town, of, machault, 30, km, northeast, of, reims, in, the, ardennes, region, he, was, employed, as, secretary, to, john, i, count, of, luxembourg, and, king, of, bohemia, from, 1323, to, 1346, and, also, became, a, canon, 1337, he, often, accompanied, king, john, on, his, various, trips, many, of, them, military, expeditions, around, europe, including, prague, he, was, named, the, canon, of, verdun, in, 1330, arras, in, 1332, and, reims, in, 1337, by, 1340, machaut, was, living, in, reims, having, relinquished, his, other, canonic, posts, at, the, request, of, pope, benedict, xii, in, 1346, king, john, was, killed, fighting, at, the, battle, of, cr, cy, and, machaut, who, was, famous, and, much, in, demand, entered, the, service, of, various, other, aristocrats, and, rulers, including, king, john, s, daughter, bonne, who, died, of, the, black, death, in, 1349, her, sons, jean, de, berry, and, charles, later, charles, v, duke, of, normandy, and, others, such, as, charles, ii, of, navarre, machaut, survived, the, black, death, that, devastated, europe, and, spent, his, later, years, living, in, reims, composing, and, supervising, the, creation, of, his, complete, works, manuscripts, his, poem, le, voir, dit, probably, 1361, 1365, purports, to, recount, a, late, love, affair, with, a, 19, year, old, girl, p, ronne, d, armenti, res, although, the, accuracy, of, the, work, as, autobiography, is, contested, he, died, in, 1377, machaut, s, music, comprises, a, wide, variety, from, complex, masses, to, short, songs, and, despite, the, differences, of, genre, most, still, contain, typical, machaut, motifs, he, lived, after, the, flowering, of, both, the, secular, troubadour, and, trouv, re, song, movements, and, the, ars, antiqua, church, style, the, musicologist, gilbert, reaney, notes, that, before, composers, either, wrote, songs, or, church, music, machaut, did, both, though, it, could, be, said, that, he, neglected, the, area, of, liturgical, church, music, besides, his, mass, hoquetus, david, and, a, few, latin, motets, machaut, s, surviving, output, is, exclusively, secular, regardless, reaney, notes, that, his, unique, mastery, of, both, secular, and, sacred, western, music, is, only, precedented, by, the, work, of, adam, de, la, halle, the, lyrics, of, machaut, s, works, almost, always, dealt, with, courtly, love, a, few, works, exist, to, commemorate, a, particular, event, such, as, m18, bone, pastor, bone, pastor, bone, pastor, machaut, mostly, composed, in, five, genres, the, lai, the, virelai, the, motet, the, ballade, and, the, rondeau, in, these, genres, machaut, retained, the, basic, formes, fixes, but, often, utilized, creative, text, setting, and, cadences, for, example, most, rondeau, phrases, end, with, a, long, melisma, on, the, penultimate, syllable, however, a, few, of, machaut, s, rondeaux, such, as, r18, puis, qu, en, oubli, are, mostly, syllabic, in, treatment, machaut, s, motets, often, contain, sacred, texts, in, the, tenor, such, as, in, m12, corde, mesto, cantando, helas, pour, quoy, virent, libera, me, the, top, two, voices, in, these, three, part, compositions, in, contrast, sing, secular, french, texts, creating, interesting, concordances, between, the, sacred, and, secular, in, his, other, genres, though, he, does, not, utilize, sacred, texts, machaut, s, cyclic, setting, of, the, mass, identified, in, one, source, as, the, messe, de, nostre, dame, mass, of, our, lady, was, composed, in, the, early, 1360s, probably, for, rheims, cathedral, while, not, the, first, cyclic, mass, the, tournai, mass, is, earlier, it, was, the, first, by, a, single, composer, and, conceived, as, a, unit, machaut, was, probably, familiar, with, the, tournai, mass, since, machaut, s, mass, shares, many, stylistic, features, with, it, including, textless, interludes, whether, or, not, machaut, s, mass, is, indeed, cyclic, is, contested, after, lengthy, debate, musicologists, are, still, deeply, divided, however, there, is, a, consensus, that, this, mass, is, at, best, a, forerunner, to, the, later, 15th, century, cyclic, masses, by, the, likes, of, josquin, des, prez, machaut, s, mass, differs, from, these, in, the, following, ways, 1, he, does, not, hold, a, tonal, centre, throughout, the, entire, work, as, the, mass, uses, two, distinct, modes, one, for, the, kyrie, gloria, and, credo, another, for, sanctus, agnus, and, ite, missa, est, 2, there, is, no, extended, melodic, theme, that, clearly, runs, through, all, the, movements, and, the, mass, does, not, use, the, parody, technique, 3, there, is, considerable, evidence, that, this, mass, was, not, composed, in, one, creative, act, the, fact, that, the, movements, were, placed, together, does, not, mean, they, were, conceived, as, such, nevertheless, the, mass, can, be, said, to, be, stylistically, consistent, and, certainly, the, chosen, chants, are, all, celebrations, of, mary, the, mother, of, jesus, also, adding, weight, to, the, claim, that, the, mass, is, cyclic, is, the, possibility, that, the, piece, was, written, or, assembled, for, performance, at, a, specific, celebration, the, possibility, that, it, was, for, the, coronation, of, charles, v, which, was, once, widely, accepted, is, thought, unlikely, in, modern, scholarship, the, composer, s, intention, that, the, piece, be, performed, as, one, entire, mass, setting, makes, the, messe, de, nostre, dame, generally, considered, a, cyclic, composition, guillaume, de, machaut, s, lyric, output, comprises, around, 400, poems, including, 235, ballades, 76, rondeaux, 39, virelais, 24, lais, 10, complaintes, and, 7, chansons, royales, and, machaut, did, much, to, perfect, and, codify, these, fixed, forms, some, of, his, lyric, output, is, embedded, in, his, narrative, poems, or, dits, such, as, le, rem, de, de, fortune, the, cure, of, ill, fortune, which, includes, one, of, each, genre, of, lyric, poetry, and, le, voir, dit, a, true, story, but, most, are, included, in, a, separate, unordered, section, entitled, les, loanges, des, dames, that, the, majority, of, his, lyrics, are, not, set, to, music, in, manuscripts, music, and, non, music, sections, are, separate, suggests, that, he, normally, wrote, the, text, before, setting, some, to, music, other, than, his, latin, motets, of, a, religious, nature, and, some, poems, invoking, the, horrors, of, war, and, captivity, the, vast, majority, of, machaut, s, lyric, poems, reflect, the, conventions, of, courtly, love, and, involve, statements, of, service, to, a, lady, and, the, poet, s, pleasure, and, pains, in, technical, terms, machaut, was, a, master, of, elaborate, rhyme, schemes, and, this, concern, makes, him, a, precursor, to, the, grands, rh, toriqueurs, of, the, 15th, century, guillaume, de, machaut, s, narrative, output, is, dominated, by, the, dit, literally, spoken, i, e, a, poem, not, meant, to, be, sung, these, first, person, narrative, poems, all, but, one, are, written, in, octosyllabic, rhymed, couplets, like, the, romance, or, roman, of, the, same, period, follow, many, of, the, conventions, of, the, roman, de, la, rose, including, the, use, of, allegorical, dreams, songes, allegorical, characters, and, the, situation, of, the, narrator, lover, attempting, to, return, toward, or, satisfy, his, lady, machaut, is, also, the, author, of, a, poetic, chronicle, of, the, chivalric, deeds, of, peter, i, of, cyprus, the, prise, d, alexandrie, and, of, poetic, works, of, consolation, and, moral, philosophy, his, unusual, self, reflective, usage, of, himself, as, his, lyrical, persona, as, the, narrator, of, his, dits, yields, some, personal, philosophical, insights, as, well, at, the, end, of, his, life, machaut, wrote, a, poetic, treatise, on, his, craft, his, prologue, this, reflects, on, his, conception, of, the, organization, of, poetry, into, set, genres, and, rhyme, schemes, and, the, ordering, of, these, genres, into, distinct, sections, of, manuscripts, this, preoccupation, with, ordering, his, oeuvre, is, reflected, in, an, index, to, ms, a, entitled, vesci, l, ordonance, que, g, de, machaut, veut, qu, il, ait, en, son, livre, here, is, the, order, that, g, de, machaut, wants, his, book, to, have, the, poem, below, puis, qu, en, oubli, is, his, 18th, rondeau, puis, qu, en, oubli, sui, de, vous, dous, amis, vie, amoureuse, et, joie, a, dieu, commant, mar, vi, le, jour, que, m, amour, en, vous, mis, puis, qu, en, oubli, sui, de, vous, dous, amis, mais, ce, tenray, que, je, vous, ay, promis, c, est, que, ja, mais, n, aray, nul, autre, amant, puis, qu, en, oubli, sui, de, vous, dous, amis, vie, amoureuse, et, joie, a, dieu, commant, since, i, am, forgotten, by, you, sweet, friend, to, a, love, life, and, to, happiness, i, bid, goodbye, unlucky, was, the, day, i, put, my, love, in, you, since, i, am, forgotten, by, you, sweet, friend, yet, i, will, keep, what, i, have, promised, you, which, is, that, never, will, i, have, another, lover, since, i, am, forgotten, by, you, sweet, friend, to, a, love, life, and, to, happiness, i, bid, goodbye, when, he, died, in, 1377, other, composers, such, as, f, andrieu, wrote, elegies, lamenting, his, death, machaut, s, poetry, had, a, direct, effect, on, the, works, of, eustache, deschamps, jean, froissart, christine, de, pizan, ren, d, anjou, and, geoffrey, chaucer, among, many, others, there, exists, the, hypothetical, though, improbable, possibility, that, chaucer, and, machaut, could, have, met, when, chaucer, was, taken, prisoner, near, reims, in, 1359, or, in, calais, in, 1360, with, both, poets, on, official, business, for, the, ratification, of, the, treaty, of, br, tigny, machaut, with, his, patron, jean, de, berry, who, was, departing, for, england, and, chaucer, as, a, messenger, to, prince, lionel, according, to, food, historian, william, woys, weaver, fourteenth, century, nobles, at, the, french, speaking, lusignan, court, in, nicosia, cyprus, often, listened, to, narrations, of, machaut, s, prise, d, alexandrie, for, entertainment, during, royal, banquets, tales, like, machaut, s, about, heroic, crusader, figures, reinforced, the, self, image, that, lusignan, courtiers, cultivated, as, long, distance, claimants, to, jerusalem, see, clark, 2012, and, earp, 2011, for, extensive, bibliographies
