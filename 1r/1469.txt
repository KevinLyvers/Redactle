mood, of, the, masses, for, a, military, rebellion, the, diffusion, of, the, myth, about, an, alleged, communist, coup, d, tat, as, well, a, pretended, state, of, social, chaos, became, pretexts, for, a, coup, franco, himself, along, with, general, emilio, mola, had, stirred, an, anti, communist, campaign, in, morocco, on, 23, february, franco, was, sent, to, the, canary, islands, to, serve, as, the, islands, military, commander, an, appointment, perceived, by, him, as, a, destierro, banishment, meanwhile, a, conspiracy, led, by, general, mola, was, taking, shape, interested, in, the, parliamentary, immunity, granted, by, a, seat, at, the, cortes, franco, intended, to, stand, as, candidate, of, the, right, bloc, alongside, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, for, the, by, election, in, the, province, of, cuenca, programmed, for, 3, may, 1936, after, the, results, of, the, february, 1936, election, were, annulled, in, the, constituency, but, primo, de, rivera, refused, to, run, alongside, a, military, officer, franco, in, particular, and, franco, himself, ultimately, desisted, on, 26, april, one, day, before, the, decision, of, the, election, authority, by, that, time, psoe, politician, indalecio, prieto, had, already, deemed, franco, as, a, possible, caudillo, for, a, military, uprising, disenchantment, with, aza, a, s, rule, continued, to, grow, and, was, dramatically, voiced, by, miguel, de, unamuno, a, republican, and, one, of, spain, s, most, respected, intellectuals, who, in, june, 1936, told, a, reporter, who, published, his, statement, in, el, adelanto, that, president, manuel, aza, a, should, debiera, suicidarse, como, acto, patri, tico, commit, suicide, as, a, patriotic, act, in, june, 1936, franco, was, contacted, and, a, secret, meeting, was, held, within, la, esperanza, forest, on, tenerife, to, discuss, starting, a, military, coup, an, obelisk, which, has, subsequently, been, removed, commemorating, this, historic, meeting, was, erected, at, the, site, in, a, clearing, at, las, ra, ces, in, tenerife, outwardly, franco, maintained, an, ambiguous, attitude, until, nearly, july, on, 23, june, 1936, he, wrote, to, the, head, of, the, government, casares, quiroga, offering, to, quell, the, discontent, in, the, spanish, republican, army, but, received, no, reply, the, other, rebels, were, determined, to, go, ahead, con, paquito, o, sin, paquito, with, paquito, or, without, paquito, paquito, being, a, diminutive, of, paco, which, in, turn, is, short, for, francisco, as, it, was, put, by, jos, sanjurjo, the, honorary, leader, of, the, military, uprising, after, various, postponements, 18, july, was, fixed, as, the, date, of, the, uprising, the, situation, reached, a, point, of, no, return, and, as, presented, to, franco, by, mola, the, coup, was, unavoidable, and, he, had, to, choose, a, side, he, decided, to, join, the, rebels, and, was, given, the, task, of, commanding, the, army, of, africa, a, privately, owned, dh, 89, de, havilland, dragon, rapide, flown, by, two, british, pilots, cecil, bebb, and, hugh, pollard, was, chartered, in, england, on, 11, july, to, take, franco, to, africa, the, coup, underway, was, precipitated, by, the, assassination, of, the, right, wing, opposition, leader, calvo, sotelo, in, retaliation, for, the, murder, of, assault, guard, jos, castillo, which, had, been, committed, by, a, group, headed, by, a, civil, guard, and, composed, of, assault, guards, and, members, of, the, socialist, militias, on, 17, july, one, day, earlier, than, planned, the, army, of, africa, rebelled, detaining, their, commanders, on, 18, july, franco, published, a, manifesto, and, left, for, africa, where, he, arrived, the, next, day, to, take, command, a, week, later, the, rebels, who, soon, called, themselves, the, nationalists, controlled, a, third, of, spain, most, naval, units, remained, under, control, of, the, republican, loyalist, forces, which, left, franco, isolated, the, coup, had, failed, in, the, attempt, to, bring, a, swift, victory, but, the, spanish, civil, war, had, begun, franco, rose, to, power, during, the, spanish, civil, war, which, began, in, july, 1936, and, officially, ended, with, the, victory, of, his, nationalist, forces, in, april, 1939, although, it, is, impossible, to, calculate, precise, statistics, concerning, the, spanish, civil, war, and, its, aftermath, payne, writes, that, if, civilian, fatalities, above, the, norm, are, added, to, the, total, number, of, deaths, for, victims, of, violence, the, number, of, deaths, attributable, to, the, civil, war, would, reach, approximately, 344, 000, during, the, war, rape, torture, and, summary, executions, committed, by, soldiers, under, franco, s, command, were, used, as, a, means, of, retaliation, and, to, repress, political, dissent, the, war, was, marked, by, foreign, intervention, on, behalf, of, both, sides, franco, s, nationalists, were, supported, by, fascist, italy, which, sent, the, corpo, truppe, volontarie, and, by, nazi, germany, which, sent, the, condor, legion, italian, aircraft, stationed, on, majorca, bombed, barcelona, 13, times, dropping, 44, tons, of, bombs, aimed, at, civilians, these, attacks, were, requested, by, general, franco, as, retribution, against, the, catalan, population, similarly, both, italian, and, german, planes, bombed, the, basque, town, of, guernica, at, franco, s, request, the, republican, opposition, was, supported, by, communists, socialists, and, anarchists, within, spain, as, well, as, the, soviet, union, and, volunteers, who, fought, in, the, international, brigades, following, the, pronunciamiento, of, 18, july, 1936, franco, assumed, the, leadership, of, the, 30, 000, soldiers, of, the, spanish, army, of, africa, the, first, days, of, the, insurgency, were, marked, by, an, imperative, need, to, secure, control, over, the, spanish, moroccan, protectorate, on, one, side, franco, had, to, win, the, support, of, the, native, moroccan, population, and, their, nominal, authorities, and, on, the, other, he, had, to, ensure, his, control, over, the, army, his, method, was, the, summary, execution, of, some, 200, senior, officers, loyal, to, the, republic, one, of, them, his, own, cousin, his, loyal, bodyguard, was, shot, by, manuel, blanco, franco, s, first, problem, was, how, to, move, his, troops, to, the, iberian, peninsula, since, most, units, of, the, navy, had, remained, in, control, of, the, republic, and, were, blocking, the, strait, of, gibraltar, he, requested, help, from, benito, mussolini, who, responded, with, an, offer, of, arms, and, planes, in, germany, wilhelm, canaris, the, head, of, the, abwehr, military, intelligence, service, persuaded, hitler, to, support, the, nationalists, hitler, sent, 20, ju, 52, transport, aircraft, and, six, heinkel, biplane, fighters, on, the, condition, that, they, were, not, to, be, used, in, hostilities, unless, the, republicans, attacked, first, mussolini, sent, 12, savoia, marchetti, sm, 81, transport, bombers, and, a, few, fighter, aircraft, from, 20, july, onward, franco, was, able, with, this, small, squadron, of, aircraft, to, initiate, an, air, bridge, that, carried, 1, 500, soldiers, of, the, army, of, africa, to, seville, where, these, troops, helped, to, ensure, rebel, control, of, the, city, he, successfully, negotiated, with, germany, and, italy, for, more, military, support, and, above, all, for, more, aircraft, on, 25, july, aircraft, began, to, arrive, in, tetouan, and, on, 5, august, franco, was, able, to, break, the, blockade, successfully, deploying, a, convoy, of, fishing, boats, and, merchant, ships, carrying, some, 3, 000, soldiers, between, 29, july, and, 15, august, about, 15, 000, more, men, were, moved, on, 26, july, just, eight, days, after, the, revolt, had, started, foreign, allies, of, the, republican, government, convened, an, international, communist, conference, at,

international, immediately, started, to, organise, the, international, brigades, volunteer, military, units, which, included, the, garibaldi, brigade, from, italy, and, the, lincoln, battalion, from, the, united, states, the, international, brigades, were, usually, deployed, as, shock, troops, and, as, a, result, they, suffered, high, casualties, in, early, august, the, situation, in, western, andalucia, was, stable, enough, to, allow, franco, to, organise, a, column, some, 15, 000, men, at, its, height, under, the, command, of, then, lieutenant, colonel, juan, yag, e, which, would, march, through, extremadura, towards, madrid, on, 11, august, m, rida, was, taken, and, on, 15, august, badajoz, thus, joining, both, nationalist, controlled, areas, additionally, mussolini, ordered, a, voluntary, army, the, corpo, truppe, volontarie, ctv, of, fully, motorised, units, some, 12, 000, italians, to, seville, and, hitler, added, to, them, a, professional, squadron, from, the, luftwaffe, 2jg, 88, with, about, 24, planes, all, these, planes, had, the, nationalist, spanish, insignia, painted, on, them, but, were, flown, by, italian, and, german, nationals, the, backbone, of, franco, s, air, force, in, those, days, was, the, italian, sm, 79, and, sm, 81, bombers, the, biplane, fiat, cr, 32, fighter, and, the, german, junkers, ju, 52, cargo, bomber, and, the, heinkel, he, 51, biplane,

zar, of, toledo, which, was, achieved, on, 27, september, this, controversial, decision, gave, the, popular, front, time, to, strengthen, its, defences, in, madrid, and, hold, the, city, that, year, but, with, soviet, support, kennan, alleges, that, once, stalin, had, decided, to, assist, the, spanish, republicans, the, operation, was, put, in, place, with, remarkable, speed, and, energy, the, first, load, of, arms, and, tanks, arrived, as, early, as, 26, september, and, was, secretly, unloaded, at, night, advisers, accompanied, the, armaments, soviet, officers, were, in, effective, charge, of, military, operations, on, the, madrid, front, kennan, believes, that, this, operation, was, originally, conducted, in, good, faith, with, no, other, purpose, than, saving, the, republic, hitler, s, policy, for, spain, was, shrewd, and, pragmatic, the, minutes, of, a, conference, with, his, foreign, minister, and, army, chiefs, at, the, reich, chancellery, in, berlin, on, 10, november, 1937, summarised, his, views, on, foreign, policy, regarding, the, spanish, civil, war, on, the, other, hand, a, 100, percent, victory, for, franco, was, not, desirable, either, from, the, german, point, of, view, rather, were, we, interested, in, a, continuance, of, the, war, and, in, the, keeping, up, of, the, tension, in, the, mediterranean, hitler, distrusted, franco, according, to, the, comments, he, made, at, the, conference, he, wanted, the, war, to, continue, but, he, did, not, want, franco, to, achieve, total, victory, he, felt, that, with, franco, in, undisputed, control, of, spain, the, possibility, of, italy, intervening, further, or, of, its, continuing, to, occupy, the, balearic, islands, would, be, prevented, by, february, 1937, the, soviet, union, s, military, help, started, to, taper, off, to, be, replaced, by, limited, economic, aid, the, designated, leader, of, the, uprising, general, jos, sanjurjo, died, on, 20, july, 1936, in, a, plane, crash, in, the, nationalist, zone, political, life, ceased, initially, only, military, command, mattered, this, was, divided, into, regional, commands, emilio, mola, in, the, north, gonzalo, queipo, de, llano, in, seville, commanding, andalucia, franco, with, an, independent, command, and, miguel, cabanellas, in, zaragoza, commanding, aragon, the, spanish, army, of, morocco, was, itself, split, into, two, columns, one, commanded, by, general, juan, yag, e, and, the, other, commanded, by, colonel, jos, varela, from, 24, july, a, coordinating, junta, the, national, defence, junta, was, established, based, at, burgos, nominally, led, by, cabanellas, as, the, most, senior, general, it, initially, included, mola, three, other, generals, and, two, colonels, franco, was, later, added, in, early, august, on, 21, september, it, was, decided, that, franco, was, to, be, commander, in, chief, this, unified, command, was, opposed, only, by, cabanellas, and, after, some, discussion, with, no, more, than, a, lukewarm, agreement, from, queipo, de, llano, and, from, mola, also, head, of, government, he, was, doubtlessly, helped, to, this, primacy, by, the, fact, that, in, late, july, hitler, had, decided, that, all, of, germany, s, aid, to, the, nationalists, would, go, to, franco, mola, had, been, somewhat, discredited, as, the, main, planner, of, the, attempted, coup, that, had, now, degenerated, into, a, civil, war, and, was, strongly, identified, with, the, carlist, monarchists, and, not, at, all, with, the, falange, a, party, with, fascist, leanings, and, connections, phalanx, a, far, right, spanish, political, party, founded, by, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, nor, did, he, have, good, relations, with, germany, queipo, de, llano, and, cabanellas, had, both, previously, rebelled, against, the, dictatorship, of, general, miguel, primo, de, rivera, and, were, therefore, discredited, in, some, nationalist, circles, and, falangist, leader, jos, antonio, primo, de, rivera, was, in, prison, in, alicante, he, would, be, executed, a, few, months, later, the, desire, to, keep, a, place, open, for, him, prevented, any, other, falangist, leader, from, emerging, as, a, possible, head, of, state, franco, s, previous, aloofness, from, politics, meant, that, he, had, few, active, enemies, in, any, of, the, factions, that, needed, to, be, placated, and, he, had, also, cooperated, in, recent, months, with, both, germany, and, italy, on, 1, october, 1936, in, burgos, franco, was, publicly, proclaimed, as, general, simo, of, the, national, army, and, jefe, del, estado, head, of, state, when, mola, was, killed, in, another, air, accident, a, year, later, on, 2, june, 1937, which, some, believe, was, an, assassination, no, military, leader, was, left, from, those, who, had, organised, the, conspiracy, against, the, republic, between, 1933, and, 1935, franco, personally, guided, military, operations, from, this, time, until, the, end, of, the, war, franco, himself, was, not, a, strategic, genius, but, he, was, very, effective, at, organisation, administration, logistics, and, diplomacy, after, the, failed, assault, on, madrid, in, november, 1936, franco, settled, on, a, piecemeal, approach, to, winning, the, war, rather, than, bold, manoeuvring, as, with, his, decision, to, relieve, the, garrison, at, toledo, this, approach, has, been, subject, of, some, debate, some, of, his, decisions, such, as, in, june, 1938, when, he, preferred, to, advance, towards, valencia, instead, of, catalonia, remain, particularly, controversial, from, a, military, strategic, viewpoint, valencia, castellon, and, alicante, saw, the, last, republican, troops, defeated, by, franco, although, both, germany, and, italy, provided, military, support, to, franco, the, degree, of, influence, of, both, powers, on, his, direction, of, the, war, seems, to, have, been, very, limited, nevertheless, the, italian, troops, despite, not, always, being, effective, were, present, in, most, of, the, large, operations, in, large, numbers, germany, sent, insignificant, numbers, of, combat, personnel, to, spain, but, aided, the, nationalists, with, technical, instructors, and, modern, mat, riel, including, some, 200, tanks, and, 600, aircraft, which, helped, the, nationalist, air, force, dominate, the, skies, for, most, of, the, war, franco, s, direction, of, the, german, and, italian, forces, was, limited, particularly, in, the, direction, of, the, condor, legion, but, he, was, by, default, their, supreme, commander, and, they, declined, to, interfere, in, the, politics, of, the, nationalist, zone, for, reasons, of, prestige, it, was, decided, to, continue, assisting, franco, until, the, end, of, the, war, and, italian, and, german, troops, paraded, on, the, day, of, the, final, victory, in, madrid, the, nationalist, victory, could, be, accounted, for, by, various, factors, the, popular, front, government, had, reckless, policies, in, the, weeks, prior, to, the, war, where, it, ignored, potential, dangers, and, alienated, the, opposition, encouraging, more, people, to, join, the, rebellion, while, the, rebels, had, superior, military, cohesion, with, franco, providing, the, necessary, leadership, to, consolidate, power, and, unify, the, various, rightist, factions, his, foreign, diplomacy, secured, military, aid, from, italy, and, germany, and, by, some, accounts, helped, keep, britain, and, france, out, of, the, war, the, rebels, made, effective, use, of, a, smaller, navy, acquiring, the, most, powerful, ships, in, the, spanish, fleet, and, maintaining, a, functional, officer, corps, while, republican, sailors, had, assassinated, a, large, number, of, their, naval, officers, who, sided, with, the, rebels, in, 1936, as, at, cartagena, and, el, ferrol, the, nationalists, used, their, ships, aggressively, to, pursue, the, opposition, in, contrast, to, the, largely, passive, naval, strategy, of, the, republicans, not, only, did, the, nationalists, receive, more, foreign, aid, to, sustain, their, war, effort, but, there, is, evidence, that, they, made, more, efficient, use, of, such, aid, they, augmented, their, forces, with, arms, captured, from, the, republicans, and, successfully, integrated, over, half, of, republican, prisoners, of, war, into, the, nationalist, army, the, rebels, were, able, to, build, a, larger, air, force, and, make, more, effective, use, of, their, air, force, particularly, in, supporting, ground, operations, and, bombing, and, generally, enjoyed, air, superiority, from, mid, 1937, onwards, this, air, power, contributed, greatly, to, the, nationalist, victory, the, republicans, were, subject, to, disunity, and, infighting, and, were, hampered, by, the, destructive, consequences, of, the, revolution, in, the, republican, zone, mobilisation, was, impeded, the, republican, image, was, harmed, abroad, in, democracies, and, the, campaign, against, religion, aroused, overwhelming, and, unwavering, catholic, support, for, the, nationalists, on, 19, april, 1937, franco, and, serrano, s, er, with, the, acquiescence, of, generals, mola, and, quiepo, de, llano, forcibly, merged, the, ideologically, distinct, national, syndicalist, falange, and, the, carlist, monarchist, parties, into, one, party, under, his, rule, dubbed, falange, espa, ola, tradicionalista, y, de, las, juntas, de, ofensiva, nacional, sindicalista, fet, y, de, las, jons, which, became, the, only, legal, party, in, 1939, unlike, some, other, fascist, movements, the, falangists, had, developed, an, official, program, in, 1934, the, twenty, seven, points, in, 1937, franco, assumed, as, the, tentative, doctrine, of, his, regime, 26, out, of, the, original, 27, points, franco, made, himself, jefe, nacional, national, chief, of, the, new, fet, falange, espa, ola, tradicionalista, traditionalist, spanish, phalanx, with, a, secretary, political, junta, and, national, council, to, be, named, subsequently, by, himself, five, days, later, on, 24, april, the, raised, arm, salute, of, the, falange, was, made, the, official, salute, of, the, nationalist, regime, also, in, 1937, the, marcha, real, royal, march, was, restored, by, decree, as, the, national, anthem, in, the, nationalist, zone, it, was, opposed, by, the, falangists, who, associated, it, with, the, monarchy, and, boycotted, it, when, it, was, played, often, singing, their, own, anthem, cara, al, sol, facing, the, sun, instead, by, 1939, the, fascist, style, prevailed, with, ritual, rallying, calls, of, franco, franco, franco, franco, s, advisor, on, falangist, party, matters, ram, n, serrano, s, er, who, was, the, brother, in, law, of, his, wife, carmen, polo, and, a, group, of, serrano, s, er, s, followers, dominated, the, fet, jons, and, strove, to, increase, the, party, s, power, serrano, s, er, tried, to, move, the, party, in, a, more, fascist, direction, by, appointing, his, acolytes, to, important, positions, and, the, party, became, the, leading, political, organisation, in, francoist, spain, the, fet, jons, failed, to, establish, a, fascist, party, regime, however, and, was, relegated, to, subordinate, status, franco, placed, the, carlist, manuel, fal, cond, under, house, arrest, and, imprisoned, hundreds, of, old, falangists, the, so, called, old, shirts, camisas, viejas, including, the, party, leader, manuel, hedilla, to, help, secure, his, political, future, franco, also, appeased, the, carlists, by, exploiting, the, republicans, anti, clericalism, in, his, propaganda, in, particular, concerning, the, martyrs, of, the, war, while, the, republican, forces, presented, the, war, as, a, struggle, to, defend, the, republic, against, fascism, franco, depicted, himself, as, the, defender, of, catholic, spain, against, atheist, communism, by, early, 1939, only, madrid, see, history, of, madrid, and, a, few, other, areas, remained, under, control, of, the, government, forces, on, 27, february, chamberlain, s, britain, and, daladier, s, france, officially, recognised, the, franco, regime, on, 28, march, 1939, with, the, help, of, pro, franco, forces, inside, the, city, the, fifth, column, general, mola, had, mentioned, in, propaganda, broadcasts, in, 1936, madrid, fell, to, the, nationalists, the, next, day, valencia, which, had, held, out, under, the, guns, of, the, nationalists, for, close, to, two, years, also, surrendered, victory, was, proclaimed, on, 1, april, 1939, when, the, last, of, the, republican, forces, surrendered, on, the, same, day, franco, placed, his, sword, upon, the, altar, of, a, church, and, vowed, to, never, take, it, up, again, unless, spain, itself, was, threatened, with, invasion, although, germany, had, recognised, the, franco, government, franco, s, policy, towards, germany, was, extremely, cautious, until, spectacular, german, victories, at, the, beginning, of, the, second, world, war, an, early, indication, that, franco, was, going, to, keep, his, distance, from, germany, soon, proved, true, a, rumoured, state, visit, by, franco, to, germany, did, not, take, place, and, a, further, rumour, of, a, visit, by, goering, to, spain, after, he, had, enjoyed, a, cruise, in, the, western, mediterranean, again, did, not, materialise, instead, goering, had, to, return, to, berlin, during, the, civil, war, and, in, the, aftermath, a, period, known, as, the, white, terror, took, place, this, saw, mass, executions, of, republican, and, other, nationalist, enemies, standing, in, contrast, to, the, wartime, red, terror, historical, analysis, and, investigations, estimate, the, number, of, executions, by, the, franco, regime, during, this, time, to, be, between, 100, 000, and, 200, 000, dead, stanley, g, payne, says, the, total, number, of, all, kinds, of, executions, in, the, republican, zone, added, up, to, about, 56, 000, and, that, those, in, the, nationalist, zone, probably, amounted, to, at, least, 70, 000, with, an, additional, 28, 000, executions, after, the, war, ended, recent, searches, conducted, with, parallel, excavations, of, mass, graves, in, spain, by, the, association, for,

preston, 150, 000, wartime, civilian, executions, took, place, in, the, francoist, area, as, well, as, 50, 000, in, the, republican, area, in, addition, to, approximately, 20, 000, civilians, executed, by, the, franco, regime, after, the, end, of, the, war, according, to, helen, graham, the, spanish, working, classes, became, to, the, francoist, project, what, the, jews, were, to, the, german, volksgemeinschaft, according, to, gabriel, jackson, and, antony, beevor, the, number, of, victims, of, the, white, terror, executions, and, hunger, or, illness, in, prisons, between, 1939, and, 1943, was, 200, 000, beevor, reckons, franco, s, ensuing, white, terror, claimed, 200, 000, lives, the, red, terror, had, already, killed, 38, 000, julius, ruiz, concludes, that, although, the, figures, remain, disputed, a, minimum, of, 37, 843, executions, were, carried, out, in, the, republican, zone, with, a, maximum, of, 150, 000, executions, including, 50, 000, after, the, war, in, nationalist, spain, despite, the, end, of, the, war, spanish, guerrillas, exiled, in, france, and, known, as, the, maquis, continued, to, resist, franco, in, the, pyrenees, carrying, out, sabotage, and, robberies, against, the, francoist, regime, several, exiled, republicans, also, fought, in, the, french, resistance, against, the, german, occupation, in, vichy, france, during, world, war, ii, in, 1944, a, group, of, republican, veterans, from, the, french, resistance, invaded, the, val, d, aran, in, northwest, catalonia, but, were, quickly, defeated, the, activities, of, the, maquis, continued, well, into, the, 1950s, the, end, of, the, war, led, to, hundreds, of, thousands, of, exiles, mostly, to, france, but, also, to, mexico, chile, cuba, and, the, united, states, on, the, other, side, of, the, pyrenees, refugees, were, confined, in, internment, camps, in, france, such, as, camp, gurs, or, camp, vernet, where, 12, 000, republicans, were, housed, in, squalid, conditions, mostly, soldiers, from, the, durruti, division, the, 17, 000, refugees, housed, in, gurs, were, divided, into, four, categories, brigadists, pilots, gudaris, and, ordinary, spaniards, the, gudaris, basques, and, the, pilots, easily, found, local, backers, and, jobs, and, were, allowed, to, quit, the, camp, but, the, farmers, and, ordinary, people, who, could, not, find, relations, in, france, were, encouraged, by, the, french, government, in, agreement, with, the, francoist, government, to, return, to, spain, the, great, majority, did, so, and, were, turned, over, to, the, francoist, authorities, in, ir, n, from, there, they, were, transferred, to, the, miranda, de, ebro, camp, for, purification, according, to, the, law, of, political, responsibilities, after, the, proclamation, by, marshal, philippe, p, tain, of, the, vichy, france, regime, the, refugees, became, political, prisoners, and, the, french, police, attempted, to, round, up, those, who, had, been, liberated, from, the, camp, along, with, other, undesirables, they, were, sent, to, the, drancy, internment, camp, before, being, deported, to, nazi, germany, 5, 000, spaniards, thus, died, in, mauthausen, concentration, camp, the, chilean, poet, pablo, neruda, who, had, been, named, by, the, chilean, president, pedro, aguirre, cerda, special, consul, for, immigration, in, paris, was, given, responsibility, for, what, he, called, the, noblest, mission, i, have, ever, undertaken, shipping, more, than, 2, 000, spanish, refugees, who, had, been, housed, by, the, french, in, squalid, camps, to, chile, on, an, old, cargo, ship, the, winnipeg, in, september, 1939, world, war, ii, began, franco, had, received, important, support, from, adolf, hitler, and, benito, mussolini, during, the, spanish, civil, war, and, he, had, signed, the, anti, comintern, pact, he, made, pro, axis, speeches, while, offering, various, kinds, of, support, to, italy, and, germany, his, spokesman, antonio, tovar, commented, at, a, paris, conference, entitled, bolshevism, versus, europe, that, spain, aligned, itself, definitively, on, the, side, of, national, socialist, germany, and, fascist, italy, however, franco, was, reluctant, to, enter, the, war, due, to, spain, recovering, from, its, recent, civil, war, and, instead, pursued, a, policy, of, non, belligerence, on, 23, october, 1940, hitler, and, franco, met, in, hendaye, france, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, spain, s, entry, on, the, side, of, the, axis, franco, s, demands, including, large, supplies, of, food, and, fuel, as, well, as, spanish, control, of, gibraltar, and, french, north, africa, proved, too, much, for, hitler, at, the, time, hitler, did, not, want, to, risk, damaging, his, relations, with, the, new, vichy, french, government, an, oft, cited, remark, attributed, to, hitler, is, that, the, german, leader, said, that, he, would, rather, have, some, of, his, own, teeth, pulled, out, than, to, have, to, personally, deal, further, with, franco, some, historians, argue, that, franco, made, demands, he, knew, hitler, would, not, accede, to, in, order, to, stay, out, of, the, war, other, historians, argue, that, franco, as, the, leader, of, a, destroyed, and, bankrupt, country, in, chaos, following, a, brutal, three, year, civil, war, simply, had, little, to, offer, the, axis, and, that, the, spanish, armed, forces, were, not, ready, for, a, major, war, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, franco, decided, not, to, join, the, war, after, the, resources, he, requested, from, hitler, in, october, 1940, were, not, forthcoming, franco, allowed, spanish, soldiers, to, volunteer, to, fight, in, the, german, army, against, the, soviet, union, the, blue, division, but, forbade, spaniards, to, fight, in, the, west, against, the, democracies, franco, s, common, ground, with, hitler, was, particularly, weakened, by, hitler, s, attempts, to, manipulate, christianity, which, went, against, franco, s, fervent, commitment, to, defending, catholicism, contributing, to, the, disagreement, was, an, ongoing, dispute, over, german, mining, rights, in, spain, according, to, some, scholars, after, the, fall, of, france, in, june, 1940, spain, did, adopt, a, pro, axis, stance, for, example, german, and, italian, ships, and, u, boats, were, allowed, to, use, spanish, naval, facilities, before, returning, to, a, more, neutral, position, in, late, 1943, when, the, tide, of, the, war, had, turned, decisively, against, the, axis, powers, and, italy, had, changed, sides, franco, was, initially, keen, to, join, the, war, before, the, uk, could, be, defeated, in, the, winter, of, 1940, and, 1941, franco, toyed, with, the, idea, of, a, latin, bloc, formed, by, spain, portugal, vichy, france, the, vatican, and, italy, without, much, consequence, franco, had, cautiously, decided, to, enter, the, war, on, the, axis, side, in, june, 1940, and, to, prepare, his, people, for, war, an, anti, british, and, anti, french, campaign, was, launched, in, the, spanish, media, that, demanded, french, morocco, cameroon, and, gibraltar, on, 19, june, 1940, franco, pressed, along, a, message, to, hitler, saying, he, wanted, to, enter, the, war, but, hitler, was, annoyed, at, franco, s, demand, for, the, french, colony, of, cameroon, which, had, been, german, before, world, war, i, and, which, hitler, was, planning, on, taking, back, for, plan, z, franco, seriously, considered, blocking, allied, access, to, the, mediterranean, sea, by, invading, british, held, gibraltar, but, he, abandoned, the, idea, after, learning, that, the, plan, would, have, likely, failed, due, to, gibraltar, being, too, heavily, defended, in, addition, declaring, war, on, the, uk, and, its, allies, would, no, doubt, give, them, an, opportunity, to, capture, both, the, canary, islands, and, spanish, morocco, as, well, as, possibly, launch, an, invasion, of, mainland, spain, itself, franco, was, aware, that, his, air, force, would, be, quickly, defeated, if, going, into, action, against, the, royal, air, force, and, the, royal, navy, would, easily, be, able, to, destroy, spain, s, small, navy, and, blockade, the, entire, spanish, coast, to, prevent, imports, of, crucial, materials, such, as, oil, spain, depended, on, oil, imports, from, the, united, states, which, were, almost, certain, to, be, cut, off, if, spain, formally, joined, the, axis, franco, and, serrano, su, er, held, a, meeting, with, mussolini, and, ciano, in, bordighera, italy, on, 12, february, 1941, however, an, affected, mussolini, did, not, appear, to, be, interested, in, franco, s, help, due, to, the, defeats, his, forces, had, suffered, in, north, africa, and, the, balkans, and, he, even, told, franco, that, he, wished, he, could, find, any, way, to, leave, the, war, when, the, invasion, of, the, soviet, union, began, on, 22, june, 1941, franco, s, foreign, minister, ram, n, serrano, su, er, immediately, suggested, the, formation, of, a, unit, of, military, volunteers, to, join, the, invasion, volunteer, spanish, troops, the, divisi, n, azul, or, blue, division, fought, on, the, eastern, front, under, german, command, from, 1941, to, 1944, some, historians, have, argued, that, not, all, of, the, blue, division, were, true, volunteers, and, that, franco, expended, relatively, small, but, significant, resources, to, aid, the, axis, powers, battle, against, the, soviet, union, franco, was, initially, disliked, by, cuban, president, fulgencio, batista, who, during, world, war, ii, suggested, a, joint, u, s, latin, american, declaration, of, war, on, spain, to, overthrow, franco, s, regime, hitler, may, not, have, really, wanted, spain, to, join, the, war, as, he, needed, neutral, harbours, to, import, materials, from, countries, in, latin, america, and, elsewhere, he, felt, spain, would, be, a, burden, as, it, would, be, dependent, on, germany, for, help, by, 1941, vichy, french, forces, were, proving, their, effectiveness, in, north, africa, reducing, the, need, for, spanish, help, and, hitler, was, wary, about, opening, up, a, new, front, on, the, western, coast, of, europe, as, he, struggled, to, reinforce, the, italians, in, greece, and, yugoslavia, franco, signed, a, revised, anti, comintern, pact, on, 25, november, 1941, spain, continued, to, be, able, to, obtain, valuable, german, goods, including, military, equipment, as, part, of, payment, for, spanish, raw, materials, and, traded, wolfram, with, germany, until, august, 1944, when, the, germans, withdrew, from, the, spanish, frontier, spanish, neutrality, during, world, war, ii, was, publicly, acknowledged, by, leading, allied, statesmen, in, november, 1942, us, president, roosevelt, wrote, to, general, franco, your, nation, and, mine, are, friends, in, the, best, sense, of, the, word, in, may, 1944, winston, churchill, stated, in, the, house, of, commons, in, the, dark, days, of, the, war, the, attitude, of, the, spanish, government, in, not, giving, our, enemies, passage, through, spain, was, extremely, helpful, to, us, i, must, say, that, i, shall, always, consider, that, a, service, was, rendered, by, spain, not, only, to, the, united, kingdom, and, to, the, british, empire, and, commonwealth, but, to, the, cause, of, the, united, nations, according, to, the, personal, recollection, of, us, ambassador, to, spain, carlton, hayes, similar, gratitude, was, also, expressed, by, the, provisional, french, government, at, algiers, in, 1943, franco, placed, no, obstacles, to, britain, s, construction, of, a, large, air, base, extending, from, gibraltar, into, spanish, territorial, waters, and, welcomed, the, anglo, american, landings, in, north, africa, spain, did, not, intern, any, of, the, 1, 200, american, airmen, who, were, forced, to, land, in, the, country, but, gave, them, refuge, and, permitted, them, to, leave, after, the, war, the, spanish, government, tried, to, destroy, all, evidence, of, its, cooperation, with, the, axis, in, 2010, documents, were, discovered, showing, that, on, 13, may, 1941, franco, ordered, his, provincial, governors, to, compile, a, list, of, jews, while, he, negotiated, an, alliance, with, the, axis, powers, franco, supplied, reichsf, hrer, ss, heinrich, himmler, architect, of, the, nazis, final, solution, with, a, list, of, 6, 000, jews, in, spain, on, 14, june, 1940, spanish, forces, in, morocco, occupied, tangier, a, city, under, international, control, and, did, not, leave, until, the, war, s, end, in, 1945, after, the, war, franco, allowed, many, former, nazis, such, as, otto, skorzeny, and, l, on, degrelle, and, other, fascists, to, seek, political, asylum, in, spain, franco, had, a, controversial, association, with, jews, before, and, during, world, war, ii, he, made, antisemitic, remarks, in, a, speech, in, may, 1939, and, made, similar, remarks, on, at, least, six, occasions, during, world, war, ii, franco, believed, in, the, existence, of, a, jewish, masonic, bolshevik, conspiracy, and, he, deliberately, framed, the, spanish, civil, war, as, a, conflict, against, jews, and, bolsheviks, in, 2010, documents, were, discovered, showing, that, on, 13, may, 1941, franco, ordered, his, provincial, governors, to, compile, a, list, of, jews, while, he, negotiated, an, alliance, with, the, axis, powers, franco, supplied, reichsf, hrer, ss, heinrich, himmler, architect, of, the, nazis, final, solution, with, a, list, of, 6, 000, jews, in, spain, contrarily, according, to, anti, semitism, a, historical, encyclopedia, of, prejudice, and, persecution, 2005, preston, writes, that, in, the, post, war, years, a, myth, was, carefully, constructed, to, claim, that, franco, s, regime, had, saved, many, jews, from, extermination, as, a, means, to, deflect, foreign, criticism, away, from, allegations, of, active, collaboration, with, the, nazi, regime, as, early, as, 1943, the, ministry, of, foreign, affairs, concluded, that, the, allies, were, likely, to, win, the, war, jos, f, lix, de, lequerica, y, erquiza, became, foreign, minister, in, 1944, and, soon, developed, an, obsession, with, the, importance, of, the, jewish, card, in, relations, with, the, former, allied, powers, spain, provided, visas, for, thousands, of, french, jews, to, transit, spain, en, route, to, portugal, to, escape, the, nazis, spanish, diplomats, protected, about, 4, 000, jews, living, in, hungary, romania, bulgaria, czechoslovakia, and, austria, at, least, some, 20, 000, to, 30, 000, jews, were, allowed, to, pass, through, spain, in, the, first, half, of, the, war, jews, who, were, not, allowed, to, enter, spain, however, were, sent, to, the, miranda, de, ebro, concentration, camp, or, deported, to, france, in, january, 1943, after, the, german, embassy, in, spain, told, the, spanish, government, that, it, had, two, months, to, remove, its, jewish, citizens, from, western, europe, spain, severely, limited, visas, and, only, 800, jews, were, allowed, to, enter, the, country, after, the, war, franco, exaggerated, his, contributions, to, saving, jews, in, order, to, improve, spain, s, image, in, the, world, and, end, its, international, isolation, after, the, war, franco, did, not, recognise, israeli, statehood, and, maintained, strong, relations, with, the, arab, world, israel, expressed, disinterest, in, establishing, relations, although, there, were, some, informal, economic, ties, between, the, two, countries, in, the, later, years, of, franco, s, governance, in, the, aftermath, of, the, six, day, war, in, 1967, franco, s, spain, was, able, to, utilise, its, positive, relationship, with, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, and, the, arab, world, due, to, not, having, recognised, the, israeli, state, to, allow, 800, egyptian, jews, many, of, sephardic, ancestry, safe, passage, out, of, egypt, on, spanish, passports, this, was, undertaken, through, francoist, spain, s, ambassador, to, egypt, ngel, sagaz, zubelzu, on, the, understanding, that, emigrant, jews, would, not, immediately, emigrate, to, israel, and, that, they, would, not, publicly, use, the, case, as, political, propaganda, against, nasser, s, egypt, on, 16, december, 1968, the, spanish, government, formally, revoked, the, 1492, edict, of, expulsion, against, spain, s, jewish, population, franco, personally, and, many, in, the, government, openly, stated, that, they, believed, there, was, an, international, conspiracy, of, freemasons, and, communists, against, spain, sometimes, including, jews, or, judeo, masonry, as, part, of, this, while, under, the, leadership, of, francisco, franco, the, spanish, government, explicitly, endorsed, the, catholic, church, as, the, religion, of, the, nation, state, and, did, not, endorse, liberal, ideas, such, as, religious, pluralism, or, separation, of, church, and, state, found, in, the, republican, constitution, of, 1931, following, the, second, world, war, the, government, enacted, the, spanish, bill, of, rights, fuero, de, los, espa, oles, which, extended, the, right, to, private, worship, of, non, catholic, religions, including, judaism, though, it, did, not, permit, the, erection, of, religious, buildings, for, this, practice, and, did, not, allow, non, catholic, public, ceremonies, with, the, pivot, of, spain, s, foreign, policy, towards, the, united, states, during, the, cold, war, the, situation, changed, with, the, 1967, law, on, religious, freedom, which, granted, full, public, religious, rights, to, non, catholics, the, overthrow, of, catholicism, as, the, explicit, state, religion, of, spain, and, the, establishment, of, state, sponsored, religious, pluralism, would, be, realised, in, spain, in, 1978, with, the, new, constitution, of, spain, three, years, after, franco, s, death, franco, was, recognised, as, the, spanish, head, of, state, by, the, united, kingdom, france, and, argentina, in, february, 1939, already, proclaimed, general, simo, of, the, nationalists, and, jefe, del, estado, head, of, state, in, october, 1936, he, thereafter, assumed, the, official, title, of, su, excelencia, el, jefe, de, estado, his, excellency, the, head, of, state, he, was, also, referred, to, in, state, and, official, documents, as, caudillo, de, espa, a, the, leader, of, spain, and, sometimes, called, el, caudillo, de, la, ltima, cruzada, y, de, la, hispanidad, the, leader, of, the, last, crusade, and, of, the, hispanic, heritage, and, el, caudillo, de, la, guerra, de, liberaci, n, contra, el, comunismo, y, sus, c, mplices, the, leader, of, the, war, of, liberation, against, communism, and, its, accomplices, on, paper, franco, had, more, power, than, any, spanish, leader, before, or, since, for, the, first, four, years, after, taking, madrid, he, ruled, almost, exclusively, by, decree, the, law, of, the, head, of, state, passed, in, august, 1939, permanently, confided, all, governing, power, to, franco, he, was, not, required, to, even, consult, the, cabinet, for, most, legislation, or, decrees, according, to, payne, franco, possessed, far, more, day, to, day, power, than, hitler, or, stalin, possessed, at, the, respective, heights, of, their, power, he, noted, that, while, hitler, and, stalin, maintained, rubber, stamp, parliaments, this, was, not, the, case, in, spain, in, the, early, years, after, the, war, a, situation, that, nominally, made, franco, s, regime, the, most, purely, arbitrary, in, the, world, this, changed, in, 1942, when, franco, convened, a, parliament, known, as, the, cortes, espa, olas, it, was, elected, in, accordance, with, corporatist, principles, and, had, little, real, power, notably, it, had, no, control, over, government, spending, and, the, government, was, not, responsible, to, it, ministers, were, appointed, and, dismissed, by, franco, alone, on, 26, july, 1947, franco, proclaimed, spain, a, monarchy, but, did, not, designate, a, monarch, this, gesture, was, largely, done, to, appease, the, monarchists, in, the, movimiento, nacional, carlists, and, alfonsoists, franco, left, the, throne, vacant, proclaiming, himself, as, a, de, facto, regent, for, life, at, the, same, time, franco, appropriated, many, of, the, privileges, of, a, king, he, wore, the, uniform, of, a, captain, general, a, rank, traditionally, reserved, for, the, king, and, resided, in, el, pardo, palace, in, addition, he, began, walking, under, a, canopy, and, his, portrait, appeared, on, most, spanish, coins, and, postage, stamps, he, also, added, by, the, grace, of, god, a, phrase, usually, part, of, the, styles, of, monarchs, to, his, style, franco, initially, sought, support, from, various, groups, his, administration, marginalised, fascist, ideologues, in, favour, of, technocrats, many, of, whom, were, linked, with, opus, dei, who, promoted, economic, modernisation, franco, adopted, fascist, trappings, although, stanley, payne, argued, that, very, few, scholars, consider, him, to, be, a, core, fascist, regarding, the, regime, the, oxford, living, dictionary, uses, franco, s, regime, as, an, example, of, fascism, and, it, has, also, been, variously, presented, as, a, fascistized, dictatorship, or, a, semi, fascist, regime, francisco, cobo, romero, writes, that, besides, neutering, left, wing, advances, by, using, an, essentially, antiliberal, brand, of, ultranationalism, in, its, attempt, to, emulate, fascism, francoism, resorted, to, the, sacralization, and, mystification, of, the, motherland, raising, it, into, an, object, of, cult, and, coating, it, with, a, liturgic, divinization, of, its, leader, all, in, all, some, authors, have, pointed, at, a, purported, artificialness, and, failure, of, fet, jons, in, order, to, de, emphasise, the, fascist, weight, within, the, regime, whereas, others, have, embedded, those, perceived, features, of, weak, party, within, the, frame, of, a, particular, model, of, spanish, fascism, however, new, research, material, has, been, argued, to, underpin, the, fascist, subject, both, on, the, basis, of, the, existence, of, a, pervasive, and, fully, differentiated, fascist, falangist, political, culture, and, on, the, importance, of, the, civil, war, for, falangism, which, served, as, an, area, of, experience, of, violence, of, memory, as, well, as, for, the, generation, of, a, culture, of, victory, under, the, perspective, of, a, comparative, of, european, fascisms, javier, rodrigo, considers, the, francoist, regime, to, be, paradigmatic, for, three, reasons, for, being, the, only, authoritarian, european, regime, with, totalitarian, aspirations, for, being, the, regime, that, deployed, the, most, political, violence, in, times, of, rhetorical, peace, and, for, being, the, regime, deploying, the, most, effective, memoricidal, apparatus, with, the, end, of, world, war, ii, spain, suffered, from, the, consequences, of, its, isolation, from, the, international, economy, spain, was, excluded, from, the, marshall, plan, unlike, other, neutral, countries, in, europe, this, situation, ended, in, part, when, in, the, light, of, cold, war, tensions, and, of, spain, s, strategic, location, the, united, states, of, america, entered, into, a, trade, and, military, alliance, with, franco, this, historic, alliance, commenced, with, the, visit, of, us, president, dwight, eisenhower, to, spain, in, 1953, which, resulted, in, the, pact, of, madrid, spain, was, then, admitted, to, the, united, nations, in, 1955, american, military, facilities, in, spain, built, since, then, include, naval, station, rota, mor, n, air, base, and, torrej, n, air, base, according, to, preston, s, estimates, franco, s, forces, killed, about, 420, 000, spaniards, in, the, theatre, of, war, through, extrajudicial, killings, during, the, civil, war, and, in, state, executions, immediately, following, its, end, in, 1939, the, first, decade, of, franco, s, rule, following, its, end, saw, continued, repression, and, the, killing, of, an, undetermined, number, of, political, opponents, in, 1941, the, prison, population, of, spain, was, 233, 000, mostly, political, prisoners, according, to, antony, beevor, recent, research, in, more, than, half, of, spain, s, provinces, indicates, at, least, 35, 000, official, executions, in, the, country, after, the, war, suggesting, that, the, generally, accepted, figure, of, 35, 000, official, executions, is, low, accounting, for, unofficial, and, random, killings, and, those, who, died, during, the, war, from, execution, suicide, starvation, and, disease, in, prison, the, total, number, is, probably, closer, to, 200, 000, by, the, start, of, the,

andalucian, tradition, was, considered, part, of, a, larger, national, identity, all, cultural, activities, were, subject, to, censorship, and, many, such, as, the, sardana, the, national, dance, of, catalonia, were, plainly, forbidden, often, in, an, erratic, manner, this, cultural, policy, was, relaxed, over, time, most, notably, during, the, late, 1960s, and, early, 1970s, franco, also, used,

off, almost, all, international, trade, the, policy, had, devastating, effects, and, the, economy, stagnated, only, black, marketeers, could, enjoy, an, evident, affluence, on, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, a, combination, of, pressure, from, the, united, states, and, the, imf, managed, to, convince, the, regime, to, adopt, a, free, market, economy, many, of, the, old, guard, in, charge, of, the, economy, were, replaced, by, technocrats, technocrata, despite, some, initial, opposition, from, franco, the, regime, took, its, first, faltering, steps, toward, abandoning, its, pretensions, of, self, sufficiency, and, towards, a, transformation, of, spain, s, economic, system, pre, civil, war, industrial, production, levels, were, regained, in, the, early, 1950s, though, agricultural, output, remained, below, prewar, levels, until, 1958, the, years, from, 1951, to, 1956, were, marked, by, substantial, economic, progress, but, the, reforms, of, the, period, were, only, sporadically, implemented, and, they, were, not, well, coordinated, from, the, mid, 1950s, there, was, a, slow, but, steady, acceleration, in, economic, activity, but, the, relative, lack, of, growth, compared, to, the, rest, of, western, europe, eventually, forced, the, franco, regime, to, allow, the, introduction, of, liberal, economic, policies, in, the, late, 1950s, during, the, pre, stabilization, years, of, 1957, 1959, spanish, economic, planners, implemented, partial, measures, such, as, moderate, anti, inflationary, adjustments, and, incremental, moves, to, integrate, spain, into, the, global, economy, but, external, developments, and, a, worsening, domestic, economic, crisis, forced, them, to, adopt, more, sweeping, changes, a, reorganisation, of, the, council, of, ministers, in, early, 1957, had, brought, a, group, of, younger, men, most, of, whom, were, educated, in, economics, and, had, experience, to, the, key, ministries, the, process, of, integrating, the, country, into, the, world, economy, was, further, facilitated, by, the, reforms, of, the, 1959, stabilization, and, liberalization, plan, when, franco, replaced, his, ideological, ministers, with, the, apolitical, technocrats, the, regime, implemented, several, development, policies, that, included, deep, economic, reforms, after, a, recession, growth, took, off, from, 1959, creating, an, economic, boom, that, lasted, until, 1974, and, became, known, as, the, spanish, miracle, concurrent, with, the, absence, of, social, reforms, and, the, economic, power, shift, a, tide, of, mass, emigration, commenced, to, other, european, countries, and, to, a, lesser, extent, to, south, america, emigration, helped, the, regime, in, two, ways, the, country, got, rid, of, populations, it, would, not, have, been, able, to, keep, in, employment, and, the, emigrants, supplied, the, country, with, much, needed, monetary, remittances, during, the, 1960s, the, wealthy, classes, of, francoist, spain, experienced, further, increases, in, wealth, particularly, those, who, remained, politically, faithful, while, a, burgeoning, middle, class, became, visible, as, the, economic, miracle, progressed, international, firms, established, factories, in, spain, where, salaries, were, low, company, taxes, very, low, strikes, forbidden, and, workers, health, or, state, protections, almost, unheard, of, state, owned, firms, like, the, car, manufacturer, seat, truck, builder, pegaso, and, oil, refiner, inh, massively, expanded, production, furthermore, spain, was, virtually, a, new, mass, market, spain, became, the, second, fastest, growing, economy, in, the, world, between, 1959, and, 1973, just, behind, japan, by, the, time, of, franco, s, death, in, 1975, spain, still, lagged, behind, most, of, western, europe, but, the, gap, between, its, per, capita, gdp, and, that, of, the, leading, western, european, countries, had, narrowed, greatly, and, the, country, had, developed, a, large, industrialised, economy, in, the, late, 1960s, the, ageing, franco, decided, to, name, a, monarch, to, succeed, his, regency, but, the, simmering, tensions, between, the, carlists, and, the, alfonsoists, continued, in, 1969, franco, formally, nominated, as, his, heir, apparent, prince, juan, carlos, de, borb, n, who, had, been, educated, by, him, in, spain, with, the, new, title, of, prince, of, spain, suggested, by, laureano, l, pez, rod, to, avoid, a, confrontation, with, juan, carlos, s, father, juan, de, borb, n, the, count, of, barcelona, this, designation, came, as, a, surprise, to, the, carlist, pretender, to, the, throne, prince, xavier, of, bourbon, parma, as, well, as, to, don, juan, as, his, final, years, progressed, tensions, within, the, various, factions, of, the, movimiento,

from, various, health, problems, and, juan, carlos, took, over, as, acting, head, of, state, franco, recovered, and, on, 2, september, he, resumed, his, duties, as, head, of, state, a, year, later, he, fell, ill, again, afflicted, with, further, health, problems, including, a, long, battle, with, parkinson, s, disease, franco, s, last, public, appearance, was, on, 1, october, 1975, when, despite, his, gaunt, and, frail, appearance, he, gave, a, speech, to, crowds, from, the, balcony, at, the, royal, palace, of, madrid, warning, the, people, that, there, was, a, masonic, leftist, and, communist, conspiracy, against, spain, on, 30, october, 1975, he, fell, into, a, coma, and, was, put, on, life, support, franco, s, family, agreed, to, disconnect, the, life, support, machines,

the, high, altar, of, the, church, in, 1956, a, fact, unknown, to, the, spanish, people, until, almost, thirty, years, later, franco, was, the, only, person, interred, in, the, valley, who, did, not, die, during, the, civil, war, he, was, buried, a, few, metres, from, the, grave, of, the, falange, s, founder, jose, antonio, a, requiem, mass, and, a, military, parade, took, place, on, the, day, of,

an, authentic, national, hero, who, above, others, had, the, qualities, needed, to, wrest, spain, from, the, hands, of, the, visionaries, ideologues, marxists, and, nihilists, i, e, from, the, democratically, elected, government, of, the, country, conversely, critics, on, the, left, have, denounced, him, as, a, tyrant, responsible, for, thousands, of, deaths, in, years, long, political,
