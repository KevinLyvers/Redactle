wager, who, instilled, in, them, not, only, polite, manners, and, good, behaviour, but, also, liberal, social, and, philosophical, opinions, such, views, were, consistent, with, the, progressive, minded, tradition, of, both, sides, of, the, family, when, the, young, vaughan, williams, asked, his, mother, about, darwin, s, controversial, book, on, the, origin, of, species, she, answered, the, bible, says, that, god, made, the, world, in, six, days, great, uncle, charles, thinks, it, took, longer, but, we, need, not, worry, about, it, for, it, is, equally, wonderful, either, way, in, 1878, at, the, age, of, five, vaughan, williams, began, receiving, piano, lessons, from, his, aunt, sophy, wedgwood, he, displayed, signs, of, musical, talent, early, on, composing, his, first, piece, of, music, a, four, bar, piano, piece, called, the, robin, s, nest, in, the, same, year, he, did, not, greatly, like, the, piano, and, was, pleased, to, begin, violin, lessons, the, following, year, in,

field, house, preparatory, school, in, rottingdean, on, the, south, coast, of, england, forty, miles, 64, km, from, wotton, he, was, generally, happy, there, although, he, was, shocked, to, encounter, for, the, first, time, social, snobbery, and, political, conservatism, which, were, rife, among, his, fellow, pupils, from, there, he, moved, on, to, the, public, school, charterhouse, in, january, 1887, his, academic, and, sporting, achievements, there, were, satisfactory, and, the, school, encouraged, his, musical, development, in, 1888, he, organised, a, concert, in, the, school, hall, which, included, a, performance, of, his, g, major, piano, trio, now, lost, with, the, composer, as, violinist, while, at, charterhouse, vaughan, williams, found, that, religion, meant, less, and, less, to, him, and, for, a, while, he, was, an, atheist, this, softened, into, a, cheerful, agnosticism, and, he, continued, to, attend, church, regularly, to, avoid, upsetting, the, family, his, views, on, religion, did, not, affect, his, love, of, the, authorised, version, of, the, bible, the, beauty, of, which, in, the, words, of, his, widow, ursula, vaughan, williams, in, her, 1964, biography, of, the, composer, remained, one, of, his, essential, companions, through, life, in, this, as, in, many, other, things, in, his, life, he, was, according, to, his, biographer, michael, kennedy, that, extremely, english, product, the, natural, nonconformist, with, a, conservative, regard, for, the, best, tradition, in, july, 1890, vaughan, williams, left, charterhouse, and, in, september, he, was, enrolled, as, a, student, at, the, royal, college, of, music, rcm, london, after, a, compulsory, course, in, harmony, with, francis, edward, gladstone, professor, of, organ, counterpoint, and, harmony, he, studied, organ, with, walter, parratt, and, composition, with, hubert, parry, he, idolised, parry, and, recalled, in, his, musical, autobiography, 1950, parry, once, said, to, me, write, choral, music, as, befits, an, englishman, and, a, democrat, we, pupils, of, parry, have, if, we, have, been, wise, inherited, from, him, the, great, english, choral, tradition, which, tallis, passed, on, to, byrd, byrd, to, gibbons, gibbons, to, purcell, purcell, to, battishill, and, greene, and, they, in, their, turn, through, the, wesleys, to, parry, he, has, passed, on, the, torch, to, us, and, it, is, our, duty, to, keep, it, alight, vaughan, williams, s, family, would, have, preferred, him, to, have, remained, at, charterhouse, for, two, more, years, and, then, go, on, to, cambridge, university, they, were, not, convinced, that, he, was, talented, enough, to, pursue, a, musical, career, but, feeling, it, would, be, wrong, to, prevent, him, from, trying, they, had, allowed, him, to, go, to, the, rcm, nevertheless, a, university, education, was, expected, of, him, and, in, 1892, he, temporarily, left, the, rcm, and, entered, trinity, college, cambridge, where, he, spent, three, years, studying, music, and, history, among, those, with, whom, vaughan, williams, became, friendly, at, cambridge, were, the, philosophers, g, e, moore, and, bertrand, russell, the, historian, g, m, trevelyan, and, the, musician, hugh, allen, he, felt, intellectually, overshadowed, by, some, of, his, companions, but, he, learned, much, from, them, and, formed, lifelong, friendships, with, several, among, the, women, with, whom, he, mixed, socially, at, cambridge, was, adeline, fisher, the, daughter, of, herbert, fisher, an, old, friend, of, the, vaughan, williams, family, she, and, vaughan, williams, grew, close, and, in, june, 1897, after, he, had, left, cambridge, they, became, engaged, to, be, married, during, his, time, at, cambridge, vaughan, williams, continued, his, weekly, lessons, with, parry, and, studied, composition, with, charles, wood, and, organ, with, alan, gray, he, graduated, as, bachelor, of, music, in, 1894, and, bachelor, of, arts, the, following, year, after, leaving, the, university, he, returned, to, complete, his, training, at, the, rcm, parry, had, by, then, succeeded, sir, george, grove, as, director, of, the, college, and, vaughan, williams, s, new, professor, of, composition, was, charles, villiers, stanford, relations, between, teacher, and, student, were, stormy, but, affectionate, stanford, who, had, been, adventurous, in, his, younger, days, had, grown, deeply, conservative, he, clashed, vigorously, with, his, modern, minded, pupil, vaughan, williams, had, no, wish, to, follow, in, the, traditions, of, stanford, s, idols, brahms, and, wagner, and, he, stood, up, to, his, teacher, as, few, students, dared, to, do, beneath, stanford, s, severity, lay, a, recognition, of, vaughan, williams, s, talent, and, a, desire, to, help, the, young, man, correct, his, opaque, orchestration, and, extreme, predilection, for, modal, music, in, his, second, spell, at, the, rcm, 1895, 1896, vaughan, williams, got, to, know, a, fellow, student, gustav, holst, who, became, a, lifelong, friend, stanford, emphasised, the, need, for, his, students, to, be, self, critical, but, vaughan, williams, and, holst, became, and, remained, one, another, s, most, valued, critics, each, would, play, his, latest, composition, to, the, other, while, still, working, on, it, vaughan, williams, later, observed, what, one, really, learns, from, an, academy, or, college, is, not, so, much, from, one, s, official, teachers, as, from, one, s, fellow, students, every, subject, under, the, sun, from, the, lowest, note, of, the, double, bassoon, to, the, philosophy, of, jude, the, obscure, in, 1949, he, wrote, of, their, relationship, holst, declared, that, his, music, was, influenced, by, that, of, his, friend, the, converse, is, certainly, true, vaughan, williams, had, a, modest, private, income, which, in, his, early, career, he, supplemented, with, a, variety, of, musical, activities, although, the, organ, was, not, his, preferred, instrument, the, only, post, he, ever, held, for, an, annual, salary, was, as, a, church, organist, and, choirmaster, he, held, the, position, at, st, barnabas, in, the, inner, london, district, of, south, lambeth, from, 1895, to, 1899, for, a, salary, of, 50, a, year, he, disliked, the, job, but, working, closely, with, a, choir, was, valuable, experience, for, his, later, undertakings, in, october, 1897, adeline, and, vaughan, williams, were, married, they, honeymooned, for, several, months, in, berlin, where, he, studied, with, max, bruch, on, their, return, they, settled, in, london, originally, in, westminster, and, from, 1905, in, chelsea, there, were, no, children, of, the, marriage, in, 1899, vaughan, williams, passed, the, examination, for, the, degree, of, doctor, of, music, at, cambridge, the, title, was, formally, conferred, on, him, in, 1901, the, song, linden, lea, became, the, first, of, his, works, to, appear, in, print, published, in, the, magazine, the, vocalist, in, april, 1902, and, then, as, separate, sheet, music, in, addition, to, composition, he, occupied, himself, in, several, capacities, during, the, first, decade, of, the, century, he, wrote, articles, for, musical, journals, and, for, the, second, edition, of, grove, s, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, edited, the, first, volume, of, purcell, s, welcome, songs, for, the, purcell, society, and, was, for, a, while, involved, in, adult, education, in, the, university, extension, lectures, from, 1904, to, 1906, he, was, music, editor, of, a, new, hymn, book, the, english, hymnal, of, which, he, later, said, i, now, know, that, two, years, of, close, association, with, some, of, the, best, as, well, as, some, of, the, worst, tunes, in, the, world, was, a, better, musical, education, than, any, amount, of, sonatas, and, fugues, always, committed, to, music, making, for, the, whole, community, he, helped, found, the, amateur, leith, hill, musical, festival, in, 1905, and, was, appointed, its, principal, conductor, a, post, he, held, until, 1953, in, 1903, 1904, vaughan, williams, started, collecting, folk, songs, he, had, always, been, interested, in, them, and, now, followed, the, example, of, a, recent, generation, of, enthusiasts, such, as, cecil, sharp, and, lucy, broadwood, in, going, into, the, english, countryside, noting, down, and, transcribing, songs, traditionally, sung, in, various, locations, collections, of, the, songs, were, published, preserving, many, that, could, otherwise, have, vanished, as, oral, traditions, died, out, vaughan, williams, incorporated, some, into, his, own, compositions, and, more, generally, was, influenced, by, their, prevailing, modal, forms, this, together, with, his, love, of, tudor, and, stuart, music, helped, shape, his, compositional, style, for, the, rest, of, his, career, over, this, period, vaughan, williams, composed, steadily, producing, songs, choral, music, chamber, works, and, orchestral, pieces, gradually, finding, the, beginnings, of, his, mature, style, his, compositions, included, the, tone, poem, in, the, fen, country, 1904, and, the, norfolk, rhapsody, no, 1, 1906, he, remained, unsatisfied, with, his, technique, as, a, composer, after, unsuccessfully, seeking, lessons, from, sir, edward, elgar, he, contemplated, studying, with, vincent, d, indy, in, paris, instead, he, was, introduced, by, the, critic, and, musicologist, m, d, calvocoressi, to, maurice, ravel, a, more, modernist, less, dogmatic, musician, than, d, indy, ravel, took, few, pupils, and, was, known, as, a, demanding, taskmaster, for, those, he, agreed, to, teach, vaughan, williams, spent, three, months, in, paris, in, the, winter, of, 1907, 1908, working, with, him, four, or, five, times, each, week, there, is, little, documentation, of, vaughan, williams, s, time, with, ravel, the, musicologist, byron, adams, advises, caution, in, relying, on, vaughan, williams, s, recollections, in, the, musical, autobiography, written, forty, three, years, after, the, event, the, degree, to, which, the, french, composer, influenced, the, englishman, s, style, is, debated, ravel, declared, vaughan, williams, to, be, my, only, pupil, who, does, not, write, my, music, nevertheless, commentators, including, kennedy, adams, hugh, ottaway, and, alain, frogley, find, vaughan, williams, s, instrumental, textures, lighter, and, sharper, in, the, music, written, after, his, return, from, paris, such, as, the, string, quartet, in, g, minor, on, wenlock, edge, the, overture, to, the, wasps, and, a, sea, symphony, vaughan, williams, himself, said, that, ravel, had, helped, him, escape, from, the, heavy, contrapuntal, teutonic, manner, in, the, years, between, his, return, from, paris, in, 1908, and, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, vaughan, williams, increasingly, established, himself, as, a, figure, in, british, music, for, a, rising, composer, it, was, important, to, receive, performances, at, the, big, provincial, music, festivals, which, generated, publicity, and, royalties, in, 1910, his, music, featured, at, two, of, the, largest, and, most, prestigious, festivals, with, the, premieres, of, the, fantasia, on, a, theme, by, thomas, tallis, at, the, three, choirs, festival, in, gloucester, cathedral, in, september, and, a, sea, symphony, at, the, leeds, festival, the, following, month, the, leading, british, music, critics, of, the, time, j, a, fuller, maitland, of, the, times, and, samuel, langford, of, the, manchester, guardian, were, strong, in, their, praise, the, former, wrote, of, the, fantasia, the, work, is, wonderful, because, it, seems, to, lift, one, into, some, unknown, region, of, musical, thought, and, feeling, throughout, its, course, one, is, never, sure, whether, one, is, listening, to, something, very, old, or, very, new, langford, declared, that, the, symphony, definitely, places, a, new, figure, in, the, first, rank, of, our, english, composers, between, these, successes, and, the, start, of, war, vaughan, williams, s, largest, scale, work, was, the, first, version, of, a, london, symphony, 1914, in, the, same, year, he, wrote, the, lark, ascending, in, its, original, form, for, violin, and, piano, despite, his, age, he, was, approaching, forty, two, in, october, vaughan, williams, volunteered, for, military, service, on, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, august, joining, the, royal, army, medical, corps, as, a, private, he, served, as, a, stretcher, bearer, in, an, ambulance, crew, in, france, and, later, in, greece, frogley, writes, of, this, period, that, vaughan, williams, was, considerably, older, than, most, of, his, comrades, and, the, back, breaking, labour, of, dangerous, night, time, journeys, through, mud, and, rain, must, have, been, more, than, usually, punishing, the, war, left, its, emotional, mark, on, vaughan, williams, who, lost, many, comrades, and, friends, including, the, young, composer, george, butterworth, in, 1917, vaughan, williams, was, commissioned, as, a, lieutenant, in, the, royal, artillery, seeing, action, in, france, from, march, 1918, the, continual, noise, of, the, guns, damaged, his, hearing, and, led, to, deafness, in, his, later, years, after, the, armistice, in, 1918, he, served, as, director, of, music, for, the, british, first, army, until, demobilised, in, february, 1919, during, the, war, vaughan, williams, stopped, writing, music, and, after, returning, to, civilian, life, he, took, some, time, before, feeling, ready, to, compose, new, works, he, revised, some, earlier, pieces, and, turned, his, attention, to, other, musical, activities, in, 1919, he, accepted, an, invitation, from, hugh, allen, who, had, succeeded, parry, as, director, to, teach, composition, at, the, rcm, he, remained, on, the, faculty, of, the, college, for, the, next, twenty, years, in, 1921, he, succeeded, allen, as, conductor, of, the, bach, choir, london, it, was, not, until, 1922, that, he, produced, a, major, new, composition, a, pastoral, symphony, the, work, was, given, its, first, performance, in, london, in, may, conducted, by, adrian, boult, and, its, american, premiere, in, june, conducted, by, the, composer, throughout, the, 1920s, vaughan, williams, continued, to, compose, conduct, and, teach, kennedy, lists, forty, works, premiered, during, the, decade, including, the, mass, in, g, minor, 1922, the, ballet, old, king, cole, 1923, the, operas, hugh, the, drover, and, sir, john, in, love, 1924, and, 1928, the, suite, flos, campi, 1925, and, the, oratorio, sancta, civitas, 1925, during, the, decade, adeline, became, increasingly, immobilised, by, arthritis, and, the, numerous, stairs, in, their, london, house, finally, caused, the, vaughan, williamses, to, move, in, 1929, to, a, more, manageable, home, the, white, gates, dorking, where, they, lived, until, adeline, s, death, in, 1951, vaughan, williams, who, thought, of, himself, as, a, complete, londoner, was, sorry, to, leave, the, capital, but, his, wife, was, anxious, to, live, in, the, country, and, dorking, was, within, reasonably, convenient, reach, of, town, in, 1932, vaughan, williams, was, elected, president, of, the, english, folk, dance, and, song, society, from, september, to, december, of, that, year, he, was, in, the, us, as, a, visiting, lecturer, at, bryn, mawr, college, pennsylvania, the, texts, of, his, lectures, were, published, under, the, title, national, music, in, 1934, they, sum, up, his, artistic, and, social, credo, more, fully, than, anything, he, had, published, previously, and, remained, in, print, for, most, of, the, remainder, of, the, century, during, the, 1930s, vaughan, williams, came, to, be, regarded, as, a, leading, figure, in, british, music, particularly, after, the, deaths, of, elgar, delius, and, holst, in, 1934, holst, s, death, was, a, severe, personal, and, professional, blow, to, vaughan, williams, the, two, had, been, each, other, s, closest, friends, and, musical, advisers, since, their, college, days, after, holst, s, death, vaughan, williams, was, glad, of, the, advice, and, support, of, other, friends, including, boult, and, the, composer, gerald, finzi, but, his, relationship, with, holst, was, irreplaceable, in, some, of, vaughan, williams, s, music, of, the, 1930s, there, is, an, explicitly, dark, even, violent, tone, the, ballet, job, a, masque, for, dancing, 1930, and, the, fourth, symphony, 1935, surprised, the, public, and, critics, the, discordant, and, violent, tone, of, the, symphony, written, at, a, time, of, growing, international, tension, led, many, critics, to, suppose, the, symphony, to, be, programmatic, hubert, foss, dubbed, it, the, romantic, and, frank, howes, called, it, the, fascist, the, composer, dismissed, such, interpretations, and, insisted, that, the, work, was, absolute, music, with, no, programme, of, any, kind, nonetheless, some, of, those, close, to, him, including, foss, and, boult, remained, convinced, that, something, of, the, troubled, spirit, of, the, age, was, captured, in, the, work, as, the, decade, progressed, vaughan, williams, found, musical, inspiration, lacking, and, experienced, his, first, fallow, period, since, his, wartime, musical, silence, after, his, anti, war, cantata, dona, nobis, pacem, in, 1936, he, did, not, complete, another, work, of, substantial, length, until, late, in, 1941, when, the, first, version, of, the, fifth, symphony, was, completed, in, 1938, vaughan, williams, met, ursula, wood, 1911, 2007, the, wife, of, an, army, officer, captain, later, lieutenant, colonel, michael, forrester, wood, she, was, a, poet, and, had, approached, the, composer, with, a, proposed, scenario, for, a, ballet, despite, their, both, being, married, and, a, four, decade, age, gap, they, fell, in, love, almost, from, their, first, meeting, they, maintained, a, secret, love, affair, for, more, than, a, decade, ursula, became, the, composer, s, muse, helper, and, london, companion, and, later, helped, him, care, for, his, ailing, wife, whether, adeline, knew, or, suspected, that, ursula, and, vaughan, williams, were, lovers, is, uncertain, but, the, relations, between, the, two, women, were, of, warm, friendship, throughout, the, years, they, knew, each, other, the, composer, s, concern, for, his, first, wife, never, faltered, according, to, ursula, who, admitted, in, the, 1980s, that, she, had, been, jealous, of, adeline, whose, place, in, vaughan, williams, s, life, and, affections, was, unchallengeable, during, the, second, world, war, vaughan, williams, was, active, in, civilian, war, work, chairing, the, home, office, committee, for, the, release, of, interned, alien, musicians, helping, myra, hess, with, the, organisation, of, the, daily, national, gallery, concerts, serving, on, a, committee, for, refugees, from, nazi, oppression, and, on, the, council, for, the, encouragement, of, music, and, the, arts, cema, the, forerunner, of, the, arts, council, in, 1940, he, composed, his, first, film, score, for, the, propaganda, film, 49th, parallel, in, 1942, michael, wood, died, suddenly, of, heart, failure, at, adeline, s, behest, the, widowed, ursula, was, invited, to, stay, with, the, vaughan, williamses, in, dorking, and, thereafter, was, a, regular, visitor, there, sometimes, staying, for, weeks, at, a, time, the, critic, michael, white, suggests, that, adeline, appears, in, the, most, amicable, way, to, have, adopted, ursula, as, her, successor, ursula, recorded, that, during, air, raids, all, three, slept, in, the, same, room, in, adjacent, beds, holding, hands, for, comfort, in, 1943, vaughan, williams, conducted, the, premiere, of, his, fifth, symphony, at, the, proms, its, serene, tone, contrasted, with, the, stormy, fourth, and, led, some, commentators, to, think, it, a, symphonic, valediction, william, glock, wrote, that, it, was, like, the, work, of, a, distinguished, poet, who, has, nothing, very, new, to, say, but, says, it, in, exquisitely, flowing, language, the, music, vaughan, williams, wrote, for, the, bbc, to, celebrate, the, end, of, the, war, thanksgiving, for, victory, was, marked, by, what, the, critic, edward, lockspeiser, called, the, composer, s, characteristic, avoidance, of, any, suggestion, of, rhetorical, pompousness, any, suspicion, that, the, septuagenarian, composer, had, settled, into, benign, tranquillity, was, dispelled, by, his, sixth, symphony, 1948, described, by, the, critic, gwyn, parry, jones, as, one, of, the, most, disturbing, musical, statements, of, the, 20th, century, opening, with, a, primal, scream, plunging, the, listener, immediately, into, a, world, of, aggression, and, impending, chaos, coming, as, it, did, near, the, start, of, the, cold, war, many, critics, thought, its, pianissimo, last, movement, a, depiction, of, a, nuclear, scorched, wasteland, the, composer, was, dismissive, of, programmatic, theories, it, never, seems, to, occur, to,

activities, he, was, a, leading, figure, in, the, society, for, the, promotion, of, new, music, and, in, 1956, he, set, up, and, endowed, the, rvw, trust, to, support, young, composers, and, promote,

with, its, sombre, questing, tone, and, did, not, immediately, achieve, the, recognition, it, later, gained, having, been, in, excellent, health, vaughan, williams, died, suddenly, in, the, early, hours, of, 26, august, 1958, at, hanover, terrace, aged, 85, two, days, later, after, a, private, funeral, at, golders, green, he, was, cremated, on, 19, september, at, a, crowded, memorial, service, his, ashes, were, interred, near, the, burial, plots, of, purcell, and, stanford, in, the, north, choir, aisle, of, westminster, abbey, michael, kennedy, characterises, vaughan, williams, s, music, as, a, strongly, individual, blending, of, the, modal, harmonies, familiar, from, folk, song, with, the, french, influence, of, ravel, and, debussy, the, basis, of, his, work, is, melody, his, rhythms, in, kennedy, s, view, being, unsubtle, at, times, vaughan, williams, s, music, is, often, described, as, visionary, kennedy, cites, the, masque, job, and, the, fifth, and, ninth, symphonies, vaughan, williams, s, output, was, prolific, and, wide, ranging, for, the, voice, he, composed, songs, operas, and, choral, works, ranging, from, simpler, pieces, suitable, for, amateurs, to, demanding, works, for, professional, choruses, his, comparatively, few, chamber, works, are, not, among, his, better, known, compositions, some, of, his, finest, works, elude, conventional, categorisation, such, as, the, serenade, to, music, 1938, for, sixteen, solo, singers, and, orchestra, flos, campi, 1925, for, solo, viola, small, orchestra, and, small, chorus, and, his, most, important, chamber, work, in, howes, s, view, not, purely, instrumental, but, a, song, cycle, on, wenlock, edge, 1909, with, accompaniment, for, string, quartet, and, piano, in, 1955, the, authors, of, the, record, guide, edward, sackville, west, and, desmond, shawe, taylor, wrote, that, vaughan, williams, s, music, showed, an, exceptionally, strong, individual, voice, vaughan, williams, s, style, is, not, remarkable, for, grace, or, politeness, or, inventive, colour, but, expresses, a, consistent, vision, in, which, thought, and, feeling, and, their, equivalent, images, in, music, never, fall, below, a, certain, high, level, of, natural, distinction, they, commented, that, the, composer, s, vision, is, expressed, in, two, main, contrasting, moods, the, one, contemplative, and, trance, like, the, other, pugnacious, and, sinister, the, first, mood, generally, predominant, in, the, composer, s, output, was, more, popular, as, audiences, preferred, the, stained, glass, beauty, of, the, tallis, fantasia, the, direct, melodic, appeal, of, the, serenade, to, music, the, pastoral, poetry, of, the, lark, ascending, and, the, grave, serenity, of, the, fifth, symphony, by, contrast, as, in, the, ferocity, of, the, fourth, and, sixth, symphonies, and, the, concerto, for, two, pianos, in, his, grimmer, moods, vaughan, williams, can, be, as, frightening, as, sibelius, and, bart, k, it, is, as, a, symphonist, that, vaughan, williams, is, best, known, the, composer, and, academic, elliott, schwartz, wrote, 1964, it, may, be, said, with, truth, that, vaughan, williams, sibelius, and, prokofieff, are, the, symphonists, of, this, century, although, vaughan, williams, did, not, complete, the, first, of, them, until, he, was, thirty, eight, years, old, the, nine, symphonies, span, nearly, half, a, century, of, his, creative, life, in, his, 1964, analysis, of, the, nine, schwartz, found, it, striking, that, no, two, of, the, symphonies, are, alike, either, in, structure, or, in, mood, commentators, have, found, it, useful, to, consider, the, nine, in, three, groups, of, three, early, middle, and, late, the, first, three, symphonies, to, which, vaughan, williams, assigned, titles, rather, than, numbers, form, a, sub, group, within, the, nine, having, programmatic, elements, absent, from, the, later, six, a, sea, symphony, 1910, the, only, one, of, the, series, to, include, a, part, for, full, choir, differs, from, most, earlier, choral, symphonies, in, that, the, choir, sings, in, all, the, movements, the, extent, to, which, it, is, a, true, symphony, has, been, debated, in, a, 2013, study, alain, frogley, describes, it, as, a, hybrid, work, with, elements, of, symphony, oratorio, and, cantata, its, sheer, length, about, eighty, minutes, was, unprecedented, for, an, english, symphonic, work, and, within, its, thoroughly, tonal, construction, it, contains, harmonic, dissonances, that, pre, echo, the, early, works, of, stravinsky, which, were, soon, to, follow, a, london, symphony, 1911, 1913, which, the, composer, later, observed, might, more, accurately, be, called, a, symphony, by, a, londoner, is, for, the, most, part, not, overtly, pictorial, in, its, presentation, of, london, vaughan, williams, insisted, that, it, is, self, expressive, and, must, stand, or, fall, as, absolute, music, there, are, some, references, to, the, urban, soundscape, brief, impressions, of, street, music, with, the, sound, of, the, barrel, organ, mimicked, by, the, orchestra, the, characteristic, chant, of, the, lavender, seller, the, jingle, of, hansom, cabs, and, the, chimes, of, big, ben, played, by, harp, and, clarinet, but, commentators, have, heard, and, the, composer, never, denied, or, confirmed, some, social, comment, in, sinister, echoes, at, the, end, of, the, scherzo, and, an, orchestral, outburst, of, pain, and, despair, at, the, opening, of, the, finale, schwartz, comments, that, the, symphony, in, its, unified, presentation, of, widely, heterogeneous, elements, is, very, much, like, the, city, itself, vaughan, williams, said, in, his, later, years, that, this, was, his, favourite, of, the, symphonies, the, last, of, the, first, group, is, a, pastoral, symphony, 1921, the, first, three, movements, are, for, orchestra, alone, a, wordless, solo, soprano, or, tenor, voice, is, added, in, the, finale, despite, the, title, the, symphony, draws, little, on, the, folk, songs, beloved, of, the, composer, and, the, pastoral, landscape, evoked, is, not, a, tranquil, english, scene, but, the, french, countryside, ravaged, by, war, some, english, musicians, who, had, not, fought, in, the, first, world, war, misunderstood, the, work, and, heard, only, the, slow, tempi, and, quiet, tone, failing, to, notice, the, character, of, a, requiem, in, the, music, and, mistaking, the, piece, for, a, rustic, idyll, kennedy, comments, that, it, was, not, until, after, the, second, world, war, that, the, spectral, last, post, in, the, second, movement, and, the, girl, s, lamenting, voice, in, the, finale, were, widely, noticed, and, understood, the, middle, three, symphonies, are, purely, orchestral, and, generally, conventional, in, form, with, sonata, form, modified, in, places, specified, home, keys, and, four, movement, structure, the, orchestral, forces, required, are, not, large, by, the, standards, of, the, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, although, the, fourth, calls, for, an, augmented, woodwind, section, and, the, sixth, includes, a, part, for, tenor, saxophone, the, fourth, symphony, 1935, astonished, listeners, with, its, striking, dissonance, far, removed, from, the, prevailing, quiet, tone, of, the, previous, symphony, the, composer, firmly, contradicted, any, notions, that, the, work, was, programmatical, in, any, respect, and, kennedy, calls, attempts, to, give, the, work, a, meretricious, programme, a, poor, compliment, to, its, musical, vitality, and, self, sufficiency, the, fifth, symphony, 1943, was, in, complete, contrast, to, its, predecessor, vaughan, williams, had, been, working, on, and, off, for, many, years, on, his, operatic, version, of, bunyan, s, the, pilgrim, s, progress, fearing, wrongly, as, it, turned, out, that, the, opera, would, never, be, completed, vaughan, williams, reworked, some, of, the, music, already, written, for, it, into, a, new, symphony, despite, the, internal, tensions, caused, by, the, deliberate, conflict, of, modality, in, places, the, work, is, generally, serene, in, character, and, was, particularly, well, received, for, the, comfort, it, gave, at, a, time, of, all, out, war, neville, cardus, later, wrote, the, fifth, symphony, contains, the, most, benedictory, and, consoling, music, of, our, time, with, the, sixth, symphony, 1948, vaughan, williams, once, again, confounded, expectations, many, had, seen, the, fifth, composed, when, he, was, seventy, as, a, valedictory, work, and, the, turbulent, troubled, sixth, came, as, a, shock, after, violent, orchestral, clashes, in, the, first, movement, the, obsessive, ostinato, of, the, second, and, the, diabolic, scherzo, the, finale, perplexed, many, listeners, described, as, one, of, the, strangest, journeys, ever, undertaken, in, music, it, is, marked, pianissimo, throughout, its, 10, 12, minute, duration, the, seventh, symphony, the, sinfonia, antartica, 1952, a, by, product, of, the, composer, s, score, for, scott, of, the, antarctic, has, consistently, divided, critical, opinion, on, whether, it, can, be, properly, classed, as, a, symphony, alain, frogley, in, grove, argues, that, though, the, work, can, make, a, deep, impression, on, the, listener, it, is, neither, a, true, symphony, in, the, understood, sense, of, the, term, nor, a, tone, poem, and, is, consequently, the, least, successful, of, the, mature, symphonies, the, work, is, in, five, movements, with, wordless, vocal, lines, for, female, chorus, and, solo, soprano, in, the, first, and, last, movements, in, addition, to, large, woodwind, and, percussion, sections, the, score, features, a, prominent, part, for, wind, machine, the, eighth, symphony, 1956, in, d, minor, is, noticeably, different, from, its, seven, predecessors, by, virtue, of, its, brevity, and, despite, its, minor, key, its, general, light, heartedness, the, orchestra, is, smaller, than, for, most, of, the, symphonies, with, the, exception, of, the, percussion, section, which, is, particularly, large, with, as, vaughan, williams, put, it, all, the, phones, and, spiels, known, to, the, composer, the, work, was, enthusiastically, received, at, its, early, performances, and, has, remained, among, vaughan, williams, s, most, popular, works, the, final, symphony, the, ninth, was, completed, in, late, 1957, and, premiered, in, april, 1958, four, months, before, the, composer, s, death, it, is, scored, for, a, large, orchestra, including, three, saxophones, a, flugelhorn, and, an, enlarged, percussion, section, the, mood, is, more, sombre, than, that, of, the, eighth, grove, calls, its, mood, at, once, heroic, and, contemplative, defiant, and, wistfully, absorbed, the, work, received, an, ovation, at, its, premiere, but, at, first, the, critics, were, not, sure, what, to, make, of, it, and, it, took, some, years, for, it, to, be, generally, ranked, alongside, its, eight, predecessors, grove, lists, more, than, thirty, works, by, vaughan, williams, for, orchestra, or, band, over, and, above, the, symphonies, they, include, two, of, his, most, popular, works, the, fantasia, on, a, theme, by, thomas, tallis, 1910, revised, 1919, and, the, lark, ascending, originally, for, violin, and, piano, 1914, orchestrated, 1920, other, works, that, survive, in, the, repertoire, in, britain, are, the, norfolk, rhapsody, no, 1, 1905, 1906, the, wasps, aristophanic, suite, particularly, the, overture, 1909, the, english, folk, song, suite, 1923, and, the, fantasia, on, greensleeves, 1934, vaughan, williams, wrote, four, concertos, for, violin, 1925, piano, 1926, oboe, 1944, and, tuba, 1954, another, concertante, piece, is, his, romance, for, harmonica, strings, and, piano, 1951, none, of, these, works, has, rivalled, the, popularity, of, the, symphonies, or, the, short, orchestral, works, mentioned, above, bart, k, was, among, the, admirers, of, the, piano, concerto, written, for, and, championed, by, harriet, cohen, but, it, has, remained, in, the, words, of, the, critic, andrew, achenbach, a, neglected, masterpiece, in, addition, to, the, music, for, scott, of, the, antarctic, vaughan, williams, composed, incidental, music, for, eleven, other, films, from, 49th, parallel, 1941, to, the, vision, of, william, blake, 1957, by, comparison, with, his, output, in, other, genres, vaughan, williams, s, music, for, chamber, ensembles, and, solo, instruments, forms, a, small, part, of, his, oeuvre, grove, lists, twenty, four, pieces, under, the, heading, chamber, and, instrumental, three, are, early, unpublished, works, vaughan, williams, like, most, leading, british, 20th, century, composers, was, not, drawn, to, the, solo, piano, and, wrote, little, for, it, from, his, mature, years, there, survive, for, standard, chamber, groupings, two, string, quartets, 1908, 1909, revised, 1921, and, 1943, 1944, a, phantasy, string, quintet, 1912, and, a, sonata, for, violin, and, piano, 1954, the, first, quartet, was, written, soon, after, vaughan, williams, s, studies, in, paris, with, ravel, whose, influence, is, strongly, evident, in, 2002, the, magazine, gramophone, described, the, second, quartet, as, a, masterpiece, that, should, be, but, is, not, part, of, the, international, chamber, repertory, it, is, from, the, same, period, as, the, sixth, symphony, and, has, something, of, that, work, s, severity, and, anguish, the, quintet, 1912, was, written, two, years, after, the, success, of, the, tallis, fantasia, with, which, it, has, elements, in, common, both, in, terms, of, instrumental, layout, and, the, mood, of, rapt, contemplation, the, violin, sonata, has, made, little, impact, ursula, vaughan, williams, wrote, of, her, husband, s, love, of, literature, and, listed, some, of, his, favourite, writers, and, writings, from, skelton, and, chaucer, sidney, spenser, the, authorised, version, of, the, bible, the, madrigal, poets, the, anonymous, poets, to, shakespeare, inevitably, and, devotedly, on, to, herbert, and, his, contemporaries, milton, bunyan, and, shelley, tennyson, swinburne, both, rossettis, whitman, barnes, hardy, and, housman, in, addition, to, his, love, of, poetry, vaughan, williams, s, vocal, music, is, inspired, by, his, lifelong, belief, that, the, voice, can, be, made, the, medium, of, the, best, and, deepest, human, emotion, between, the, mid, 1890s, and, the, late, 1950s, vaughan, williams, set, more, than, eighty, poems, for, voice, and, piano, accompaniment, the, earliest, to, survive, is, a, cradle, song, to, coleridge, s, words, from, about, 1894, the, songs, include, many, that, have, entered, the, repertory, such, as, linden, lea, 1902, silent, noon, 1904, and, the, song, cycles, songs, of, travel, 1905, and, 1907, and, on, wenlock, edge, to, vaughan, williams, the, human, voice, was, the, oldest, and, greatest, of, musical, instruments, he, described, his, early, songs, as, more, or, less, simple, and, popular, in, character, and, the, musicologist, sophie, fuller, describes, this, simplicity, and, popularity, as, consistent, throughout, his, career, many, composers, of, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, centuries, wrote, sentimental, works, for, female, voice, by, contrast, songs, by, vaughan, williams, such, as, the, vagabond, from, songs, of, travel, to, words, by, robert, louis, stevenson, are, a, particularly, masculine, breath, of, fresh, air, fuller, virile, open, air, verses, kennedy, some, of, vaughan, williams, s, later, songs, are, less, well, known, fuller, singles, out, the, cycle, three, poems, by, walt, whitman, a, largely, dark, work, as, too, often, overlooked, by, singers, and, critics, for, some, of, his, songs, the, composer, expands, the, accompaniment, to, include, two, or, more, string, instruments, in, addition, to, the, piano, they, include, on, wenlock, edge, and, the, chaucer, cycle, merciless, beauty, 1921, judged, by, an, anonymous, contemporary, critic, as, surely, among, the, best, of, modern, english, songs, despite, his, agnosticism, vaughan, williams, composed, many, works, for, church, performance, his, two, best, known, hymn, tunes, both, from, c, 1905, are, down, ampney, to, the, words, come, down, o, love, divine, and, sine, nomine, for, all, the, saints, grove, lists, a, dozen, more, composed, between, 1905, and, 1935, other, church, works, include, a, magnificat, and, nunc, dimittis, 1925, the, mass, in, g, minor, 1920, 1921, a, te, deum, 1928, and, the, motets, o, clap, your, hands, 1920, lord, thou, hast, been, our, refuge, 1921, and, o, taste, and, see, 1953, first, performed, at, the, coronation, of, queen, elizabeth, ii, vaughan, williams, s, choral, works, for, concert, performance, include, settings, of, both, secular, and, religious, words, the, former, include, toward, the, unknown, region, to, words, by, whitman, composed, 1904, 1906, five, tudor, portraits, words, by, john, skelton, 1935, and, the, shakespearean, serenade, to, music, in, its, alternative, version, for, chorus, and, orchestra, 1938, choral, pieces, with, religious, words, include, the, oratorio, sancta, civitas, 1923, 1925, and, the, christmas, cantata, hodie, 1954, in, 1953, the, composer, said, that, of, his, choral, works, sancta, civitas, was, his, favourite, the, dona, nobis, pacem, an, impassioned, anti, war, cantata, 1936, is, a, combination, of, both, with, words, from, whitman, and, others, juxtaposed, with, extracts, from, the, latin, mass, anticipating, a, similar, mixture, of, sacred, and, secular, text, in, britten, s, war, requiem, twenty, five, years, later, vaughan, williams, was, wary, of, conventional, labels, his, best, known, ballet, is, described, on, the, title, page, as, a, masque, for, dancing, and, only, one, of, his, operatic, works, is, categorised, by, the, composer, simply, as, an, opera, for, some, of, his, theatre, pieces, that, could, be, classed, as, operas, or, ballets, he, preferred, the, terms, masque, romantic, extravaganza, play, set, to, music, or, morality, in, a, 2013, survey, of, vaughan, williams, s, stage, works, eric, saylor, writes, with, the, possible, exception, of, tchaikovsky, no, composer, s, operatic, career, was, less, emblematic, of, his, success, elsewhere, although, vaughan, williams, was, a, regular, opera, goer, enthusiastic, and, knowledgeable, about, works, by, operatic, masters, from, mozart, to, wagner, and, verdi, his, success, in, the, operatic, field, was, at, best, patchy, there, is, widespread, agreement, among, commentators, that, this, was, partly, due, to, the, composer, s, poor, choice, of, librettists, for, some, though, not, all, of, his, operas, another, problem, was, his, keenness, to, encourage, amateurs, and, student, groups, which, sometimes, led, to, the, staging, of, his, operas, with, less, than, professional, standards, a, further, factor, was, the, composer, s, expressed, preference, for, slow, long, tableaux, which, tended, to, reduce, dramatic, impact, although, he, believed, them, essential, as, music, takes, a, long, time, to, speak, much, longer, than, words, by, themselves, hugh, the, drover, or, love, in, the, stocks, completed, 1919, premiere, 1924, has, a, libretto, by, the, writer, and, theatre, critic, harold, child, which, was, described, by, the, stage, as, replete, with, folksy, cotswold, village, archetypes, in, the, view, of, the, critic, richard, traubner, the, piece, is, a, cross, between, traditional, ballad, opera, and, the, works, of, puccini, and, ravel, with, rhapsodic, results, the, score, uses, genuine, and, pastiche, folk, songs, but, ends, with, a, passionate, love, duet, that, traubner, considers, has, few, equals, in, english, opera, its, first, performance, was, by, students, at, the, royal, college, of, music, and, the, work, is, rarely, staged, by, major, professional, companies, old, king, cole, 1923, is, a, humorous, ballet, the, score, which, makes, liberal, use, of, folk, song, melodies, was, thought, by,

almost, symphonically, with, much, of, the, thematic, material, developed, from, the, brief, prelude, the, orchestration, is, subtle, and, foreshadows, the, ghostly, finale, of, the, sixth, symphony,

a, synthesis, of, vaughan, williams, s, stylistic, progress, over, the, years, from, the, pastoral, mediation, of, the, 1920s, to, the, angry, music, of, the, middle, symphonies, and, eventually, the,

longer, be, spoken, with, a, german, accent, and, from, it, he, forged, his, own, idiom, the, emancipation, he, achieved, thereby, was, so, complete, that, the, composers, of, succeeding, generations,
