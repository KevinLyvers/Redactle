judas, iscariot, d, u, d, s, s, k, r, i, t, biblical, greek, io, das, iskari, t, s, died, c, 30, c, 33, ad, was, according, to, christianity, s, four, canonical, gospels, a, first, century, jewish, man, who, became, a, disciple, and, one, of, the, original, twelve, apostles, of, jesus, christ, judas, betrayed, jesus, to, the, sanhedrin, in, the, garden, of, gethsemane, in, exchange, for, 30, pieces, of, silver, by, kissing, him, on, the, cheek, and, addressing, him, as, master, to, reveal, his, identity, in, the, darkness, to, the, crowd, who, had, come, to, arrest, him, in, modern, times, his, name, is, often, used, synonymously, with, betrayal, or, treason, the, gospel, of, mark, gives, no, motive, for, judas, s, betrayal, but, does, present, jesus, predicting, it, at, the, last, supper, an, event, also, described, in, all, the, other, gospels, the, gospel, of, matthew, 26, 15, states, that, judas, committed, the, betrayal, in, exchange, for, thirty, pieces, of, silver, the, gospel, of, luke, 22, 3, and, the, gospel, of, john, 13, 27, suggest, that, he, was, possessed, by, satan, according, to, matthew, 27, 1, 10, after, learning, that, jesus, was, to, be, crucified, judas, attempted, to, return, the, money, he, had, been, paid, for, his, betrayal, to, the, chief, priests, and, hanged, himself, the, priests, used, the, money, to, buy, a, field, to, bury, strangers, in, which, was, called, the, field, of, blood, because, it, had, been, bought, with, blood, money, the, book, of, acts, 1, 18, quotes, peter, as, saying, that, judas, used, the, money, to, buy, the, field, himself, and, he, headlong, burst, asunder, in, the, midst, and, all, his, bowels, gushed, out, his, place, among, the, twelve, apostles, was, later, filled, by, matthias, due, to, his, notorious, role, in, all, the, gospel, narratives, judas, remains, a, controversial, figure, in, christian, history, his, betrayal, is, seen, as, setting, in, motion, the, events, that, led, to, jesus, s, crucifixion, and, resurrection, which, according, to, traditional, christian, theology, brought, salvation, to, humanity, the, gnostic, gospel, of, judas, rejected, by, the, proto, orthodox, church, as, heretical, portrays, judas, s, actions, as, done, in, obedience, to, instructions, given, to, him, by, jesus, and, that, he, alone, amongst, the, disciples, knew, jesus, s, true, teachings, since, the, middle, ages, judas, has, sometimes, been, portrayed, as, a, personification, of, the, jewish, people, and, his, betrayal, has, been, used, to, justify, christian, antisemitism, although, judas, iscariot, s, historical, existence, is, generally, widely, accepted, among, secular, historians, this, relative, consensus, has, not, gone, entirely, unchallenged, the, earliest, possible, allusion, to, judas, comes, from, the, first, epistle, to, the, corinthians, 11, 23, 24, in, which, paul, the, apostle, does, not, mention, judas, by, name, but, uses, the, passive, voice, of, the, greek, word, parad, d, mi, which, most, bible, translations, render, as, was, betrayed, the, lord, jesus, on, the, night, when, he, was, betrayed, took, a, loaf, of, bread, nonetheless, some, biblical, scholars, argue, that, the, word, parad, d, mi, should, be, translated, as, was, handed, over, this, translation, could, still, refer, to, judas, but, it, could, also, instead, refer, to, god, metaphorically, handing, jesus, over, to, the, romans, in, his, book, antisemitism, and, modernity, 2006, the, jewish, scholar, hyam, maccoby, suggests, that, in, the, new, testament, the, name, judas, was, constructed, as, an, attack, on, the, judaeans, or, on, the, judaean, religious, establishment, held, responsible, for, executing, jesus, in, his, book, the, sins, of, scripture, 2009, john, shelby, spong, concurs, with, this, argument, insisting, the, whole, story, of, judas, has, the, feeling, of, being, contrived, the, act, of, betrayal, by, a, member, of, the, twelve, disciples, is, not, found, in, the, earliest, christian, writings, judas, is, first, placed, into, the, christian, story, by, the, gospel, of, mark, 3, 19, who, wrote, in, the, early, 70s, ad, most, scholars, reject, these, arguments, for, non, historicity, noting, that, there, is, nothing, in, the, gospels, to, associate, judas, with, judeans, except, his, name, which, was, an, extremely, common, one, for, jewish, men, during, the, first, century, and, that, numerous, other, figures, named, judas, are, mentioned, throughout, the, new, testament, none, of, whom, are, portrayed, negatively, positive, figures, named, judas, mentioned, in, the, new, testament, include, the, prophet, judas, barsabbas, acts, 15, 22, 33, jesus, s, brother, jude, mark, 6, 3, matt, 13, 55, jude, 1, and, the, apostle, judas, the, son, of, james, luke, 6, 14, 16, acts, 1, 13, john, 14, 22, the, name, judas, is, a, greek, rendering, of, the, hebrew, name, judah, y, e, h, d, h, hebrew, for, praise, or, praised, which, was, an, extremely, common, name, for, jewish, men, during, the, first, century, ad, due, to, the, renowned, hero, judas, maccabeus, consequently, numerous, other, figures, with, this, name, are, mentioned, throughout, the, new, testament, in, the, gospel, of, mark, 3, 13, 19, which, was, written, in, the, mid, 60s, or, early, 70s, ad, judas, iscariot, is, the, only, apostle, named, judas, matthew, 10, 2, 4, shares, this, portrayal, the, gospel, of, luke, 6, 12, 19, however, replaces, the, apostle, whom, mark, and, matthew, call, thaddeus, with, judas, son, of, james, peter, stanford, suggests, that, this, renaming, may, represent, an, effort, by, the, author, of, the, gospel, of, luke, to, create, a, good, judas, in, contrast, to, the, betrayer, judas, iscariot, judas, s, epithet, iscariot, or, which, distinguishes, him, from, the, other, people, named, judas, in, the, gospels, is, usually, thought, to, be, a, greek, rendering, of, the, hebrew, phrase, qr, y, t, meaning, the, man, from, kerioth, this, interpretation, is, supported, by, the, statement, in, the, gospel, of, john, 6, 71, that, judas, was, the, son, of, simon, iscariot, nonetheless, this, interpretation, of, the, name, is, not, fully, accepted, by, all, scholars, one, of, the, most, popular, alternative, explanations, holds, that, iscariot, skaryota, in, syriac, aramaic, per, the, peshitta, text, may, be, a, corruption, of, the, latin, word, sicarius, meaning, dagger, man, which, referred, to, a, member, of, the, sicarii, in, aramaic, a, group, of, jewish, rebels, who, were, known, for, assassinating, people, in, crowds, using, long, knives, hidden, under, their, cloaks, this, interpretation, is, problematic, however, because, there, is, nothing, in, the, gospels, to, associate, judas, with, the, sicarii, and, there, is, no, evidence, that, the, cadre, existed, during, the, 30s, ad, when, judas, was, alive, a, possibility, advanced, by, ernst, wilhelm, hengstenberg, is, that, iscariot, means, the, liar, or, the, false, one, from, the, hebrew, c, c, torrey, suggests, instead, the, aramaic, form, or, with, the, same, meaning, stanford, rejects, this, arguing, that, the, gospel, writers, follow, judas, s, name, with, the, statement, that, he, betrayed, jesus, so, it, would, be, redundant, for, them, to, call, him, the, false, one, before, immediately, stating, that, he, was, a, traitor, some, have, proposed, that, the, word, derives, from, an, aramaic, word, meaning, red, color, from, the, root, another, hypothesis, holds, that, the, word, derives, from, one, of, the, aramaic, roots, or, this, would, mean, to, deliver, based, on, the, septuagint, rendering, of, isaiah, 19, 4, a, theory, advanced, by, j, alfred, morin, the, epithet, could, also, be, associated, with, the, manner, of, judas, s, death, hanging, this, would, mean, iscariot, derives, from, a, kind, of, greek, aramaic, hybrid, iskarioutha, meaning, chokiness, or, constriction, this, might, indicate, that, the, epithet, was, applied, posthumously, by, the, remaining, disciples, but, joan, e, taylor, has, argued, that, it, was, a, descriptive, name, given, to, judas, by, jesus, since, other, disciples, such, as, simon, peter, cephas, kephas, rock, were, also, given, such, names, although, the, canonical, gospels, frequently, disagree, on, the, names, of, some, of, the, minor, apostles, all, four, of, them, list, judas, iscariot, as, one, of, them, the, synoptic, gospels, state, that, jesus, sent, out, the, twelve, including, judas, with, power, over, unclean, spirits, and, with, a, ministry, of, preaching, and, healing, judas, clearly, played, an, active, part, in, this, apostolic, ministry, alongside, the, other, eleven, however, in, the, gospel, of, john, judas, s, outlook, was, differentiated, many, of, jesus, s, disciples, abandoned, him, because, of, the, difficulty, of, accepting, his, teachings, and, jesus, asked, the, twelve, if, they, would, also, leave, him, simon, peter, spoke, for, the, twelve, lord, to, whom, shall, we, go, you, have, the, words, of, eternal, life, but, jesus, observed, then, that, despite, the, fact, that, he, himself, had, chosen, the, twelve, one, of, them, unnamed, by, jesus, but, identified, by, the, narrator, was, a, devil, who, would, betray, him, one, of, the, best, attested, and, most, reliable, statements, made, by, jesus, in, the, gospels, comes, from, the, gospel, of, matthew, 19, 28, in, which, jesus, tells, his, apostles, in, the, new, world, when, the, son, of, man, shall, sit, on, his, glorious, throne, you, will, also, sit, on, twelve, thrones, judging, the, twelve, tribes, of, israel, new, testament, scholar, bart, d, ehrman, concludes, this, is, not, a, tradition, that, was, likely, to, have, been, made, up, by, a, christian, later, after, jesus, s, death, since, one, of, these, twelve, had, abandoned, his, cause, and, betrayed, him, no, one, thought, that, judas, iscariot, would, be, seated, on, a, glorious, throne, in, the, kingdom, of, god, that, saying, therefore, appears, to, go, back, to, jesus, and, indicates, then, that, he, had, twelve, close, disciples, whom, he, predicted, would, reign, in, the, coming, kingdom, matthew, directly, states, that, judas, betrayed, jesus, for, a, bribe, of, thirty, pieces, of, silver, by, identifying, him, with, a, kiss, the, kiss, of, judas, to, arresting, soldiers, of, the, high, priest, caiaphas, who, then, turned, jesus, over, to, pontius, pilate, s, soldiers, mark, s, gospel, states, that, the, chief, priests, were, looking, for, a, way, to, arrest, jesus, they, decided, not, to, do, so, during, the, feast, since, they, were, afraid, that, people, would, riot, instead, they, chose, the, night, before, the, feast, to, arrest, him, according, to, luke, s, account, satan, entered, judas, at, this, time, according, to, the, account, in, the, gospel, of, john, judas, carried, the, disciples, money, bag, or, box, gl, ssokomon, but, the, gospel, of, john, makes, no, mention, of, the, thirty, pieces, of, silver, as, a, fee, for, betrayal, the, evangelist, comments, in, john, 12, 5, 6, that, judas, spoke, fine, words, about, giving, money, to, the, poor, but, the, reality, was, not, that, he, cared, for, the, poor, but, he, was, a, thief, and, had, the, money, box, and, he, used, to, take, what, was, put, in, it, however, in, john, 13, 27, 30, when, judas, left, the, gathering, of, jesus, and, his, disciples, with, betrayal, in, mind, some, thought, that, judas, might, have, been, leaving, to, buy, supplies, or, on, a, charitable, errand, ehrman, argues, that, judas, s, betrayal, is, about, as, historically, certain, as, anything, else, in, the, tradition, pointing, out, that, the, betrayal, is, independently, attested, in, the, gospel, of, mark, in, the, gospel, of, john, and, in, the, book, of, acts, ehrman, also, contends, that, it, is, highly, unlikely, that, early, christians, would, have, made, up, the, story, of, judas, s, betrayal, since, it, reflects, poorly, on, jesus, s, judgment, in, choosing, him, as, an, apostle, nonetheless, ehrman, argues, that, what, judas, actually, told, the, authorities, was, not, jesus, s, location, but, rather, jesus, s, secret, teaching, that, he, was, the, messiah, this, he, holds, explains, why, the, authorities, did, not, try, to, arrest, jesus, prior, to, judas, s, betrayal, john, p, meier, sums, up, the, historical, consensus, stating, we, only, know, two, basic, facts, about, 1, jesus, chose, him, as, one, of, the, twelve, and, 2, he, handed, over, jesus, to, the, jerusalem, authorities, thus, precipitating, jesus, s, execution, many, different, accounts, of, judas, s, death, have, survived, from, antiquity, both, within, and, outside, the, new, testament, matthew, 27, 1, 10, states, that, after, learning, that, jesus, was, to, be, crucified, judas, was, overcome, by, remorse, and, attempted, to, return, the, 30, pieces, of, silver, to, the, priests, but, they, would, not, accept, them, because, they, were, blood, money, so, he, threw, them, on, the, ground, and, left, afterwards, he, committed, suicide, by, hanging, himself, according, to, mosaic, law, deuteronomy, 21, 22, 23, the, priests, then, used, the, money, to, buy, a, potter, s, field, which, became, known, as, akeldama, khakel, dama, the, field, of, blood, because, it, had, been, bought, with, blood, money, acts, 1, 18, states, that, judas, used, the, money, to, buy, a, field, and, headlong, burst, asunder, in, the, midst, and, all, his, bowels, gushed, out, in, this, account, judas, s, death, is, apparently, by, accident, and, he, shows, no, signs, of, remorse, the, early, church, father, papias, of, hierapolis, records, in, his, expositions, of, the, sayings, of, the, lord, which, was, probably, written, around, 100, ad, that, judas, was, afflicted, by, god, s, wrath, his, body, became, so, enormously, bloated, that, he, could, not, pass, through, a, street, with, buildings, on, either, side, his, face, became, so, swollen, that, a, doctor, could, not, even, identify, the, location, of, his, eyes, using, an, optical, instrument, judas, s, genitals, became, enormously, swollen, and, oozed, with, pus, and, worms, finally, he, killed, himself, on, his, own, land, by, pouring, out, his, innards, onto, the, ground, which, stank, so, horribly, that, even, in, papias, s, own, time, a, century, later, people, still, could, not, pass, the, site, without, holding, their, noses, this, story, was, well, known, among, christians, in, antiquity, and, was, often, told, in, competition, with, the, two, conflicting, stories, from, the, new, testament, according, to, the, apocryphal, gospel, of, nicodemus, which, was, probably, written, in, the, fourth, century, ad, judas, was, overcome, with, remorse, and, went, home, to, tell, his, wife, who, was, roasting, a, chicken, on, a, spit, over, a, charcoal, fire, that, he, was, going, to, kill, himself, because, he, knew, jesus, would, rise, from, the, dead, and, when, he, did, he, would, punish, him, judas, s, wife, laughed, and, told, him, that, jesus, could, no, more, rise, from, the, dead, than, he, could, resurrect, the, chicken, she, was, cooking, immediately, the, chicken, was, restored, to, life, and, began, to, crow, judas, then, ran, away, and, hanged, himself, in, the, apocryphal, gospel, of, judas, judas, has, a, vision, of, the, disciples, stoning, and, persecuting, him, the, discrepancy, between, the, two, different, accounts, of, judas, s, death, in, matthew, 27, 1, 10, and, acts, 1, 18, has, proven, to, be, a, serious, challenge, to, those, who, support, the, idea, of, biblical, inerrancy, this, problem, was, one, of, the, points, leading, c, s, lewis, for, example, to, reject, the, view, that, every, statement, in, scripture, must, be, historical, truth, nonetheless, various, attempts, at, harmonization, have, been, suggested, generally, they, have, followed, literal, interpretations, such, as, that, of, augustine, of, hippo, which, suggest, that, these, simply, describe, different, aspects, of, the, same, event, that, judas, hanged, himself, in, the, field, and, the, rope, eventually, snapped, and, the, fall, burst, his, body, open, or, that, the, accounts, of, acts, and, matthew, refer, to, two, different, transactions, some, have, taken, the, descriptions, as, figurative, that, the, falling, prostrate, was, judas, in, anguish, and, the, bursting, out, of, the, bowels, is, pouring, out, emotion, modern, scholars, reject, these, approaches, arie, w, zwiep, states, neither, story, was, meant, to, be, read, in, light, of, the, other, and, the, integrity, of, both, stories, as, complete, narratives, in, themselves, is, seriously, disrespected, when, the, two, separate, stories, are, being, conflated, into, a, third, harmonized, version, david, a, reed, argues, that, the, matthew, account, is, a, midrashic, exposition, that, allows, the, author, to, present, the, event, as, a, fulfillment, of, prophetic, passages, from, the, old, testament, they, argue, that, the, author, adds, imaginative, details, such, as, the, thirty, pieces, of, silver, and, the, fact, that, judas, hangs, himself, to, an, earlier, tradition, about, judas, s, death, matthew, s, description, of, the, death, as, fulfilment, of, a, prophecy, spoken, through, jeremiah, the, prophet, has, caused, difficulties, since, it, does, not, clearly, correspond, to, any, known, version, of, the, book, of, jeremiah, but, does, appear, to, refer, to, a, story, from, the, book, of, zechariah, which, describes, the, return, of, a, payment, of, thirty, pieces, of, silver, even, writers, such, as, jerome, and, john, calvin, conclude, that, this, was, obviously, an, error, evangelical, theologian, james, r, white, has, suggested, the, misattribution, arises, from, a, supposed, jewish, practice, of, using, the, name, of, a, major, prophet, to, refer, to, the, whole, content, of, the, scroll, group, including, books, written, by, minor, prophets, placed, in, the, same, grouping, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, the, writer, may, also, have, had, a, passage, from, jeremiah, in, mind, such, as, chapters, 18, 1, 4, and, 19, 1, 13, which, refer, to, a, potter, s, jar, and, a, burial, place, and, chapter, 32, 6, 15, which, refers, to, a, burial, place, and, an, earthenware, jar, raymond, brown, suggests, the, most, plausible, is, that, matthew, 27, 9, 10, is, presenting, a, mixed, citation, with, words, taken, both, from, zechariah, and, jeremiah, and, he, refers, to, that, combination, by, one, name, jeremiah, 18, 9, concerns, a, potter, 18, 2, 19, 1, a, purchase, 19, 1, the, valley, of, hinnom, where, the, field, of, blood, is, traditionally, located, 19, 2, innocent, blood, 19, 4, and, the, renaming, of, a, place, for, burial, 19, 6, 11, and, jer, 32, 6, 5, tells, of, the, purchase, of, a, field, with, silver, classicist, glenn, w, most, suggests, that, judas, s, death, in, acts, can, be, interpreted, figuratively, writing, that, should, be, translated, as, saying, his, body, went, prone, rather, than, falling, headlong, and, the, spilling, of, the, entrails, is, meant, to, invoke, the, imagery, of, dead, snakes, and, their, burst, open, bellies, hence, luke, was, stating, that, judas, took, the, body, posture, of, a, snake, and, died, like, one, however, the, catholic, biblical, scholar, john, l, mckenzie, states, this, passage, probably, echoes, the, fate, of, the, wicked, in, the, deuterocanonical, book, wisdom, of, solomon, 4, 19, will, dash, them, speechless, to, the, ground, and, shake, them, from, the, foundations, they, will, be, left, utterly, dry, and, barren, and, they, will, suffer, anguish, and, the, memory, of, them, will, perish, there, are, several, explanations, as, to, why, judas, betrayed, jesus, in, the, earliest, account, in, the, gospel, of, mark, when, he, goes, to, the, chief, priests, to, betray, jesus, he, is, offered, money, as, a, reward, but, it, is, not, clear, that, money, is, his, motivation, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, account, on, the, other, hand, he, asks, what, they, will, pay, him, for, handing, jesus, over, in, the, gospel, of, luke, and, the, gospel, of, john, the, devil, enters, into, judas, causing, him, to, offer, to, betray, jesus, the, gospel, of, john, account, has, judas, complaining, that, money, has, been, spent, on, expensive, perfumes, to, anoint, jesus, which, could, have, been, spent, on, the, poor, but, adds, that, he, was, the, keeper, of, the, apostles, purse, and, used, to, steal, from, it, according, to, some, judas, thought, he, could, get, the, money, for, betraying, jesus, without, jesus, being, killed, as, he, would, escape, like, he, had, done, many, times, before, one, suggestion, has, been, that, judas, expected, jesus, to, overthrow, roman, rule, of, judea, in, this, view, judas, is, a, disillusioned, disciple, betraying, jesus, not, so, much, because, he, loved, money, but, because, he, loved, his, country, and, thought, jesus, had, failed, it, another, is, that, jesus, was, causing, unrest, likely, to, increase, tensions, with, the, roman, authorities, and, they, thought, he, should, be, restrained, until, after, the, passover, when, everyone, had, gone, back, home, and, the, commotion, had, died, down, the, gospels, suggest, that, jesus, foresaw, john, 6, 64, matthew, 26, 25, and, allowed, judas, s, betrayal, john, 13, 27, 28, one, explanation, is, that, jesus, allowed, the, betrayal, because, it, would, allow, god, s, plan, to, be, fulfilled, another, is, that, regardless, of, the, betrayal, jesus, was, ultimately, destined, for, crucifixion, in, april, 2006, a, coptic, papyrus, manuscript, titled, the, gospel, of, judas, from, 200, ad, was, translated, suggesting, that, jesus, told, judas, to, betray, him, although, some, scholars, question, the, translation, nevertheless, the, gospel, of, judas, is, an, apocryphal, gnostic, gospel, composed, in, the, 2nd, century, and, some, scholars, agree, that, it, contains, no, real, historical, information, judas, is, the, subject, of, philosophical, writings, origen, of, alexandria, in, his, commentary, on, john, s, gospel, reflects, on, judas, s, interactions, with, the, other, apostles, and, jesus, s, confidence, in, him, prior, to, his, betrayal, other, philosophical, reflections, on, judas, include, the, problem, of, natural, evil, by, bertrand, russell, and, three, versions, of, judas, a, short, story, by, jorge, luis, borges, they, allege, various, problematic, ideological, contradictions, with, the, discrepancy, between, judas, s, actions, and, his, eternal, punishment, bruce, reichenbach, argues, that, if, jesus, foresees, judas, s, betrayal, then, the, betrayal, is, not, an, act, of, free, will, and, therefore, should, not, be, punishable, conversely, it, is, argued, that, just, because, the, betrayal, was, foretold, it, does, not, prevent, judas, from, exercising, his, own, free, will, in, this, matter, other, scholars, argue, that, judas, acted, in, obedience, to, god, s, will, the, gospels, suggest, that, judas, is, apparently, bound, up, with, the, fulfillment, of, god, s, purposes, john, 13, 18, john, 17, 12, matthew, 26, 23, 25, luke, 22, 21, 22, matt, 27, 9, 10, acts, 1, 16, acts, 1, 20, yet, woe, is, upon, him, and, he, would, have, been, better, unborn, matthew, 26, 23, 25, the, difficulty, inherent, in, the, saying, is, its, paradox, if, judas, had, not, been, born, the, son, of, man, would, apparently, no, longer, do, as, it, is, written, of, him, the, consequence, of, this, apologetic, approach, is, that, judas, s, actions, come, to, be, seen, as, necessary, and, unavoidable, yet, leading, to, condemnation, another, explanation, is, that, judas, s, birth, and, betrayal, did, not, necessitate, the, only, way, the, son, of, man, could, have, suffered, and, been, crucified, the, earliest, churches, believed, as, it, is, written, of, him, to, be, prophetic, fulfilling, scriptures, such, as, that, of, the, suffering, servant, in, isaiah, 52, 53, and, the, righteous, one, in, psalm, 22, which, do, not, require, betrayal, at, least, by, judas, as, the, means, to, the, suffering, regardless, of, any, necessity, judas, is, held, responsible, for, his, act, mark, 14, 21, luke, 22, 22, matt, 26, 24, in, his, 1965, book, the, passover, plot, british, new, testament, scholar, hugh, j, schonfield, suggests, that, the, crucifixion, of, christ, was, a, conscious, re, enactment, of, biblical, prophecy, and, that, judas, acted, with, the, full, knowledge, and, consent, of, jesus, in, betraying, him, to, the, authorities, the, book, has, been, variously, described, as, factually, groundless, based, on, little, data, and, wild, suppositions, disturbing, and, tawdry, the, nature, of, judas, s, eternal, destination, has, been, a, matter, of, debate, within, christian, theology, some, have, argued, that, judas, was, damned, due, to, the, despair, which, caused, him, to, subsequently, commit, suicide, this, is, confirmed, in, cornelius, lapide, s, famous, commentary, in, which, he, writes, that, by, hanging, himself, judas, then, added, to, his, former, sin, the, further, sin, of, despair, it, was, not, a, more, heinous, sin, but, one, more, fatal, to, himself, as, thrusting, him, down, to, the, very, depths, of, hell, he, might, on, his, repentance, have, asked, and, surely, have, obtained, pardon, of, christ, but, like, cain, he, despaired, of, forgiveness, the, concept, that, judas, despaired, of, god, s, forgiveness, is, reiterated, by, rev, a, jones, in, his, contribution, to, a, mid, 20th, century, catholic, commentary, filled, with, remorse, not, true, repentance, because, empty, of, hope, sought, to, dissociate, himself, from, the, affair, before, committing, suicide, cf, matthew, 27, 3, 5, however, some, believed, that, judas, hanged, himself, thinking, to, precede, jesus, into, hades, and, there, to, plead, for, his, own, salvation, the, catholic, theologian, erasmus, believed, that, judas, was, free, to, change, his, intention, but, martin, luther, argued, in, rebuttal, that, judas, s, will, was, immutable, john, calvin, states, that, judas, was, predestined, to, damnation, but, writes, on, the, question, of, judas, s, guilt, surely, in, judas, s, betrayal, it, will, be, no, more, right, because, god, himself, willed, that, his, son, be, delivered, up, and, delivered, him, up, to, death, to, ascribe, the, guilt, of, the, crime, to, god, than, to, transfer, the, credit, for, redemption, to, judas, karl, daub, in, his, book, judas, ischariot, writes, that, judas, should, be, considered, an, incarnation, of, the, devil, for, whom, mercy, and, blessedness, are, alike, impossible, the, geneva, bible, contains, several, additional, notes, concerning, judas, iscariot, within, its, commentaries, in, the, gospel, of, matthew, after, the, sanhedrin, condemns, jesus, christ, to, death, are, added, the, comments, concerning, judas, late, repentance, brings, desperation, cf, mat, 27, 3, and, although, he, abhor, his, sins, yet, is, he, not, displeased, there, with, but, despairs, in, god, s, mercies, and, seeks, his, own, destruction, cf, mat, 27, 4, furthermore, within, acts, of, the, apostles, is, the, comment, perpetual, infamy, is, the, reward, of, all, such, as, by, unlawfully, gotten, goods, buy, anything, when, judas, purchased, the, field, of, blood, with, the, 30, pieces, of, silver, cf, acts, 1, 18, obviously, the, commentator, had, no, doubt, about, the, fate, of, judas, the, catholic, church, took, no, specific, view, concerning, the, damnation, of, judas, during, vatican, ii, speaking, in, generalities, that, council, stated, must, be, constantly, vigilant, so, that, we, may, not, be, ordered, to, go, into, the, eternal, fire, cf, mk, 25, 41, like, wicked, and, slothful, servants, cf, mk, 25, 26, into, the, exterior, darkness, where, there, will, be, the, weeping, and, the, gnashing, of, teeth, mt, 22, 13, and, 25, 30, the, vatican, only, proclaims, individuals, eternal, salvation, through, the, canon, of, saints, there, is, no, canon, of, the, damned, thus, there, is, a, school, of, thought, within, the, catholic, church, that, it, is, unknown, whether, judas, iscariot, is, in, hell, for, example, david, endres, writing, in, the, catholic, telegraph, cites, catechism, of, the, catholic, church, 597, for, the, inability, to, make, any, determination, whether, judas, is, in, hell, however, while, that, section, of, the, catechism, does, instruct, catholics, that, the, personal, sin, of, judas, is, unknown, but, to, god, that, statement, is, within, the, context, that, the, jewish, people, have, no, collective, responsibility, for, jesus, s, death, the, jews, should, not, be, spoken, of, as, rejected, or, accursed, as, if, this, followed, from, holy, scripture, this, seems, to, be, defining, a, different, doctrinal, point, i, e, the, relationship, of, catholics, with, jewish, people, rather, than, making, any, sort, of, decision, concerning, judas, s, particular, judgment, ludwig, ott, s, reference, book, fundamentals, of, catholic, dogma, identifies, judas, iscariot, as, an, example, of, a, person, receiving, punishment, as, a, particular, judgment, the, catechism, of, the, council, of, trent, which, mentions, judas, iscariot, several, times, wrote, that, he, possessed, motive, unworthy, when, he, entered, the, priesthood, and, was, thus, sentenced, to, eternal, perdition, furthermore, judas, is, given, as, an, example, of, a, sinner, that, will, despair, of, mercy, because, he, looked, on, god, as, an, avenger, of, crime, and, not, also, as, a, god, of, clemency, and, mercy, all, of, the, council, s, decrees, were, confirmed, by, pope, pius, iv, on, 28, january, 1564, thus, an, ecumenical, council, confirmed, by, the, magisterium, of, a, pope, affirmed, that, judas, iscariot, was, condemned, to, hell, the, council, of, trent, continued, the, tradition, of, the, early, church, fathers, such, as, pope, leo, i, had, not, thus, denied, his, omnipotence, he, would, have, obtained, his, mercy, and, pope, gregory, i, the, godless, betrayer, shutting, his, mind, to, all, these, things, turned, upon, himself, not, with, a, mind, to, repent, but, in, a, madness, of, self, destruction, even, in, the, act, of, dying, sinned, unto, the, increase, of, his, own, eternal, punishment, also, the, decree, of, justification, promulgated, during, session, vi, of, the, council, of, trent, states, in, cannon, 6, if, anyone, shall, say, that, it, is, not, in, the, power, of, man, to, make, his, ways, evil, but, that, god, produces, evil, as, well, as, the, good, works, not, only, by, permission, but, also, properly, and, of, himself, so, that, the, betrayal, of, judas, is, not, less, his, own, proper, work, than, the, vocation, of, paul, let, him, be, anathema, here, the, council, is, making, it, clear, that, judas, exercised, his, own, free, will, to, commit, the, betrayal, of, jesus, christ, rather, than, being, predestined, by, god, also, by, contrasting, the, actions, of, judas, to, those, of, paul, the, implication, is, that, judas, is, the, opposite, of, a, saint, i, e, damned, liturgical, institutions, are, part, of, the, expressions, of, sacred, tradition, of, the, catholic, church, within, the, 1962, roman, missal, for, the, tridentine, latin, mass, the, collect, for, holy, thursday, states, o, god, from, whom, judas, received, the, punishment, of, his, guilt, and, the, thief, the, reward, of, his, confession, our, lord, jesus, christ, gave, to, each, a, different, recompense, according, to, his, merits, in, his, commentary, on, the, liturgical, year, abbot, gueranger, o, s, b, states, that, the, collect, reminds, catholics, that, both, judas, and, the, good, thief, are, guilty, and, yet, the, one, is, condemned, the, other, pardoned, thus, the, tridentine, latin, mass, as, currently, celebrated, continues, to, foster, the, tradition, within, the, catholic, church, that, judas, was, punished, in, the, divine, comedy, of, dante, alighieri, judas, is, punished, for, all, eternity, in, the, ninth, circle, of, hell, in, it, he, is, devoured, by, lucifer, alongside, marcus, junius, brutus, and, gaius, cassius, longinus, leaders, of, the, group, of, senators, that, assassinated, julius, caesar, the, innermost, region, of, the, ninth, circle, is, reserved, for, traitors, of, masters, and, benefactors, and, is, named, judecca, after, judas, in, his, 1969, book, theologie, der, drei, tage, english, translation, mysterium, paschale, hans, urs, von, balthasar, emphasizes, that, jesus, was, not, betrayed, but, surrendered, and, delivered, up, by, himself, since, the, meaning, of, the, greek, word, used, by, the, new, testament, paradidonai, latin, tradere, is, unequivocally, handing, over, of, self, in, the, preface, to, the, second, edition, balthasar, takes, a, cue, from, revelation, 13, 8, vulgate, agni, qui, occisus, est, ab, origine, mundi, niv, the, lamb, who, was, slain, from, the, creation, of, the, world, to, extrapolate, the, idea, that, god, as, immanent, trinity, can, endure, and, conquer, godlessness, abandonment, and, death, in, an, eternal, super, kenosis, a, catholic, priest, richard, neuhaus, an, admitted, student, of, balthasar, argues, that, it, is, unknown, if, judas, is, in, hell, and, it, is, also, possible, that, hell, could, be, empty, however, french, monsignor, l, on, cristiani, considers, that, balthasar, and, neuhaus, are, merely, recycling, the, error, of, origenism, which, includes, denying, the, eternity, of, hell, by, a, general, rehabilitation, of, the, damned, including, apparently, satan, this, error, while, not, considered, a, formal, heresy, was, condemned, at, a, synod, in, 548, ad, which, was, subsequently, confirmed, by, pope, vigilius, judas, has, been, a, figure, of, great, interest, to, esoteric, groups, such, as, many, gnostic, sects, irenaeus, records, the, beliefs, of, one, gnostic, sect, the, cainites, who, believed, that, judas, was, an, instrument, of, the, sophia, divine, wisdom, thus, earning, the, hatred, of, the, demiurge, his, betrayal, of, jesus, thus, was, a, victory, over, the, materialist, world, the, cainites, later, split, into, two, groups, disagreeing, over, the, ultimate, significance, of, jesus, in, their, cosmology, the, syriac, infancy, gospel, borrows, from, some, of, the, different, versions, of, the, infancy, gospel, of, thomas, however, it, adds, many, of, its, own, tales, probably, from, local, legends, including, one, of, judas, this, pseudepigraphic, work, tells, how, judas, as, a, boy, was, possessed, by, satan, who, caused, him, to, bite, himself, or, anyone, else, present, in, one, of, these, attacks, judas, bit, the, young, jesus, in, the, side, and, by, touching, him, satan, was, exorcised, it, further, states, that, the, side, which, judas, supposedly, bit, was, the, same, side, that, was, pierced, by, the, holy, lance, at, the, crucifixion, during, the, 1970s, a, coptic, papyrus, codex, book, was, discovered, near, beni, masah, egypt, it, appeared, to, be, a, 3rd, or, 4th, century, ad, copy, of, a, 2nd, century, original, relating, a, series, of, conversations, in, which, jesus, and, judas, interact, and, discuss, the, nature, of, the, universe, from, a, gnostic, viewpoint, the, discovery, was, given, dramatic, international, exposure, in, april, 2006, when, the, us, national, geographic, magazine, published, a, feature, article, entitled, the, gospel, of, judas, with, images, of, the, fragile, codex, and, analytical, commentary, by, relevant, experts, and, interested, observers, but, not, a, comprehensive, translation, the, article, s, introduction, stated, an, ancient, text, lost, for, 1, 700, years, says, christ, s, betrayer, was, his, truest, disciple, the, article, points, to, some, evidence, that, the, original, document, was, extant, in, the, 2nd, century, around, a, d, 180, irenaeus, bishop, of, lyon, in, what, was, then, roman, gaul, wrote, a, massive, treatise, called, against, heresies, a, fictitious, history, which, they, style, the, gospel, of, judas, before, the, magazine, s, edition, was, circulated, other, news, media, gave, exposure, to, the, story, abridging, and, selectively, reporting, it, in, december, 2007, april, deconick, asserted, that, the, national, geographic, s, translation, is, badly, flawed, for, example, in, one, instance, the, national, geographic, transcription, refers, to, judas, as, a, daimon, which, the, society, s, experts, have, translated, as, spirit, however, the, universally, accepted, word, for, spirit, is, pneuma, in, gnostic, literature, daimon, is, always, taken, to, mean, demon, the, national, geographic, society, responded, that, virtually, all, issues, april, d, deconick, raises, about, translation, choices, are, addressed, in, footnotes, in, both, the, popular, and, critical, editions, in, a, later, review, of, the, issues, and, relevant, publications, critic, joan, acocella, questioned, whether, ulterior, intentions, had, not, begun, to, supersede, historical, analysis, e, g, whether, publication, of, the, gospel, of, judas, could, be, an, attempt, to, roll, back, ancient, anti, semitic, imputations, she, concluded, that, the, ongoing, clash, between, scriptural, fundamentalism, and, attempts, at, revision, were, childish, because, of, the, unreliability, of, the, sources, therefore, she, argued, people, interpret, and, cheat, the, answer, is, not, to, fix, the, bible, but, to, fix, ourselves, other, scholars, have, questioned, the, initial, translation, and, interpretation, of, the, gospel, of, judas, by, the, national, geographic, team, of, experts, according, to, medieval, copies, the, earliest, copies, from, the, 15th, century, of, the, gospel, of, barnabas, it, was, judas, not, jesus, who, was, crucified, on, the, cross, this, work, states, that, judas, s, appearance, was, transformed, to, that, of, jesus, when, the, former, out, of, betrayal, led, the, roman, soldiers, to, arrest, jesus, who, by, then, was, ascended, to, the, heavens, this, transformation, of, appearance, was, so, identical, that, the, masses, followers, of, christ, and, even, the, mother, of, jesus, mary, initially, thought, that, the, one, arrested, and, crucified, was, jesus, himself, the, gospel, then, mentions, that, after, three, days, since, burial, judas, s, body, was, stolen, from, his, grave, and, then, the, rumors, spread, of, jesus, being, risen, from, the, dead, when, jesus, was, informed, in, the, third, heaven, about, what, happened, he, prayed, to, god, to, be, sent, back, to, the, earth, and, descended, and, gathered, his, mother, disciples, and, followers, and, told, them, the, truth, of, what, happened, he, then, ascended, back, to, the, heavens, and, will, come, back, at, the, end, of, times, as, a, just, king, this, gospel, is, considered, by, the, majority, of, christians, to, be, late, and, pseudepigraphical, however, some, academics, suggest, that, it, may, contain, some, remnants, of, an, earlier, apocryphal, work, perhaps, gnostic, ebionite, or, diatessaronic, redacted, to, bring, it, more, in, line, with, islamic, doctrine, some, muslims, consider, the, surviving, versions, as, transmitting, a, suppressed, apostolic, original, some, islamic, organizations, cite, it, in, support, of, the, islamic, view, of, jesus, although, the, sanctification, of, the, instruments, of, the, passion, of, jesus, the, so, called, arma, christi, that, slowly, accrued, over, the, course, of, the, middle, ages, in, christian, symbolism, and, art, also, included, the, head, and, lips, of, judas, the, term, judas, has, entered, many, languages, as, a, synonym, for, betrayer, and, judas, has, become, the, archetype, of, the, traitor, in, western, art, and, literature, judas, is, given, some, role, in, virtually, all, literature, telling, the, passion, story, and, appears, in, numerous, modern, novels, and, movies, in, the, eastern, orthodox, hymns, of, holy, wednesday, the, wednesday, before, pascha, judas, is, contrasted, with, the, woman, who, anointed, jesus, with, expensive, perfume, and, washed, his, feet, with, her, tears, the, hymns, of, holy, wednesday, contrast, these, two, figures, encouraging, believers, to, avoid, the, example, of, the, fallen, disciple, and, instead, to, imitate, mary, s, example, of, repentance, also, wednesday, is, observed, as, a, day, of, fasting, from, meat, dairy, products, and, olive, oil, throughout, the, year, in, memory, of, the, betrayal, of, judas, the, prayers, of, preparation, for, receiving, the, eucharist, also, make, mention, of, judas, s, betrayal, i, will, not, reveal, your, mysteries, to, your, enemies, neither, like, judas, will, i, betray, you, with, a, kiss, but, like, the, thief, on, the, cross, i, will, confess, you, judas, iscariot, is, often, shown, with, red, hair, in, spanish, culture, and, by, william, shakespeare, the, practice, is, comparable, to, the, renaissance, portrayal, of, jews, with, red, hair, which, was, then, regarded, as, a, negative, trait, and, which, may, have, been, used, to, correlate, judas, iscariot, with, contemporary, jews, in, paintings, depicting, the, last, supper, judas, is, occasionally, depicted, with, a, dark, colored, halo, contrasting, with, the, lighter, halos, of, the, other, apostles, to, signify, his, former, status, as, an, apostle, more, commonly, however, he, is, the, only, one, at, the, table, without, one, some, church, stained, glass, windows, show, him, with, a, dark, halo, such, as, in, one, of, the, windows, of, the, church, of, st, john, the, baptist, yeovil
