lee, de, forest, august, 26, 1873, june, 30, 1961, was, an, american, inventor, electrical, engineer, and, an, early, pioneer, in, electronics, of, fundamental, importance, he, invented, the, first, practical, electronic, amplifier, the, three, element, audion, triode, vacuum, tube, in, 1906, this, helped, start, the, electronic, age, and, enabled, the, development, of, the, electronic, oscillator, these, made, radio, broadcasting, and, long, distance, telephone, lines, possible, and, led, to, the, development, of, talking, motion, pictures, among, countless, other, applications, he, had, over, 300, patents, worldwide, but, also, a, tumultuous, career, he, boasted, that, he, made, then, lost, four, fortunes, he, was, also, involved, in, several, major, patent, lawsuits, spent, a, substantial, part, of, his, income, on, legal, bills, and, was, even, tried, and, acquitted, for, mail, fraud, despite, this, he, was, recognised, for, his, pioneering, work, with, the, 1922, ieee, medal, of, honor, the, 1923, franklin, institute, elliott, cresson, medal, and, the, 1946, american, institute, of, electrical, engineers, edison, medal, lee, de, forest, was, born, in, 1873, in, council, bluffs, iowa, the, son, of, anna, margaret, n, e, robbins, and, henry, swift, deforest, he, was, a, direct, descendant, of, jess, de, forest, the, leader, of, a, group, of, walloon, huguenots, who, fled, europe, in, the, 17th, century, due, to, religious, persecution, de, forest, s, father, was, a, congregational, church, minister, who, hoped, his, son, would, also, become, a, pastor, in, 1879, the, elder, de, forest, became, president, of, the, american, missionary, association, s, talladega, college, in, talladega, alabama, a, school, open, to, all, of, either, sex, without, regard, to, sect, race, or, color, and, which, educated, primarily, african, americans, many, of, the, local, white, citizens, resented, the, school, and, its, mission, and, lee, spent, most, of, his, youth, in, talladega, isolated, from, the, white, community, with, several, close, friends, among, the, black, children, of, the, town, de, forest, prepared, for, college, by, attending, mount, hermon, boys, school, in, gill, massachusetts, for, two, years, beginning, in, 1891, in, 1893, he, enrolled, in, a, three, year, course, of, studies, at, yale, university, s, sheffield, scientific, school, in, new, haven, connecticut, on, a, 300, per, year, scholarship, that, had, been, established, for, relatives, of, david, de, forest, convinced, that, he, was, destined, to, become, a, famous, and, rich, inventor, and, perpetually, short, of, funds, he, sought, to, interest, companies, with, a, series, of, devices, and, puzzles, he, created, and, expectantly, submitted, essays, in, prize, competitions, all, with, little, success, after, completing, his, undergraduate, studies, in, september, 1896, de, forest, began, three, years, of, postgraduate, work, however, his, electrical, experiments, had, a, tendency, to, blow, fuses, causing, building, wide, blackouts, even, after, being, warned, to, be, more, careful, he, managed, to, douse, the, lights, during, an, important, lecture, by, professor, charles, s, hastings, who, responded, by, having, de, forest, expelled, from, sheffield, with, the, outbreak, of, the, spanish, american, war, in, 1898, de, forest, enrolled, in, the, connecticut, volunteer, militia, battery, as, a, bugler, but, the, war, ended, and, he, was, mustered, out, without, ever, leaving, the, state, he, then, completed, his, studies, at, yale, s, sloane, physics, laboratory, earning, a, doctorate, in, 1899, with, a, dissertation, on, the, reflection, of, hertzian, waves, from, the, ends, of, parallel, wires, supervised, by, theoretical, physicist, willard, gibbs, reflecting, his, pioneering, work, de, forest, has, sometimes, been, credited, as, the, father, of, radio, an, honorific, which, he, adopted, as, the, title, of, his, 1950, autobiography, in, the, late, 1800s, he, became, convinced, there, was, a, great, future, in, radiotelegraphic, communication, then, known, as, wireless, telegraphy, but, italian, guglielmo, marconi, who, received, his, first, patent, in, 1896, was, already, making, impressive, progress, in, both, europe, and, the, united, states, one, drawback, of, marconi, s, approach, was, his, use, of, a, coherer, as, a, receiver, which, while, providing, for, permanent, records, was, also, slow, after, each, received, morse, code, dot, or, dash, it, had, to, be, tapped, to, restore, operation, insensitive, and, not, very, reliable, de, forest, was, determined, to, devise, a, better, system, including, a, self, restoring, detector, that, could, receive, transmissions, by, ear, thus, making, it, capable, of, receiving, weaker, signals, and, also, allowing, faster, morse, code, sending, speeds, after, making, unsuccessful, inquiries, about, employment, with, nikola, tesla, and, marconi, de, forest, struck, out, on, his, own, his, first, job, after, leaving, yale, was, with, the, western, electric, company, s, telephone, lab, in, chicago, illinois, while, there, he, developed, his, first, receiver, which, was, based, on, findings, by, two, german, scientists, drs, a, neugschwender, and, emil, aschkinass, their, original, design, consisted, of, a, mirror, in, which, a, narrow, moistened, slit, had, been, cut, through, the, silvered, back, attaching, a, battery, and, telephone, receiver, they, could, hear, sound, changes, in, response, to, radio, signal, impulses, de, forest, along, with, ed, smythe, a, co, worker, who, provided, financial, and, technical, help, developed, variations, they, called, responders, a, series, of, short, term, positions, followed, including, three, unproductive, months, with, professor, warren, s, johnson, s, american, wireless, telegraph, company, in, milwaukee, wisconsin, and, work, as, an, assistant, editor, of, the, western, electrician, in, chicago, with, radio, research, his, main, priority, de, forest, next, took, a, night, teaching, position, at, the, lewis, institute, which, freed, him, to, conduct, experiments, at, the, armour, institute, by, 1900, using, a, spark, coil, transmitter, and, his, responder, receiver, de, forest, expanded, his, transmitting, range, to, about, seven, kilometers, four, miles, professor, clarence, freeman, of, the, armour, institute, became, interested, in, de, forest, s, work, and, developed, a, new, type, of, spark, transmitter, de, forest, soon, felt, that, smythe, and, freeman, were, holding, him, back, so, in, the, fall, of, 1901, he, made, the, bold, decision, to, go, to, new, york, to, compete, directly, with, marconi, in, transmitting, race, results, for, the, international, yacht, races, marconi, had, already, made, arrangements, to, provide, reports, for, the, associated, press, which, he, had, successfully, done, for, the, 1899, contest, de, forest, contracted, to, do, the, same, for, the, smaller, publishers, press, association, the, race, effort, turned, out, to, be, an, almost, total, failure, the, freeman, transmitter, broke, down, in, a, fit, of, rage, de, forest, threw, it, overboard, and, had, to, be, replaced, by, an, ordinary, spark, coil, even, worse, the, american, wireless, telephone, and, telegraph, company, which, claimed, its, ownership, of, amos, dolbear, s, 1886, patent, for, wireless, communication, meant, it, held, a, monopoly, for, all, wireless, communication, in, the, united, states, had, also, set, up, a, powerful, transmitter, none, of, these, companies, had, effective, tuning, for, their, transmitters, so, only, one, could, transmit, at, a, time, without, causing, mutual, interference, although, an, attempt, was, made, to, have, the, three, systems, avoid, conflicts, by, rotating, operations, over, five, minute, intervals, the, agreement, broke, down, resulting, in, chaos, as, the, simultaneous, transmissions, clashed, with, each, other, de, forest, ruefully, noted, that, under, these, conditions, the, only, successful, wireless, communication, was, done, by, visual, semaphore, wig, wag, flags, the, 1903, international, yacht, races, would, be, a, repeat, of, 1901, marconi, worked, for, the, associated, press, de, forest, for, the, publishers, press, association, and, the, unaffiliated, international, wireless, company, successor, to, 1901, s, american, wireless, telephone, and, telegraph, operated, a, high, powered, transmitter, that, was, used, primarily, to, drown, out, the, other, two, despite, this, setback, de, forest, remained, in, the, new, york, city, area, in, order, to, raise, interest, in, his, ideas, and, capital, to, replace, the, small, working, companies, that, had, been, formed, to, promote, his, work, thus, far, in, january, 1902, he, met, a, promoter, abraham, white, who, would, become, de, forest, s, main, sponsor, for, the, next, five, years, white, envisioned, bold, and, expansive, plans, that, enticed, the, inventor, however, he, was, also, dishonest, and, much, of, the, new, enterprise, would, be, built, on, wild, exaggeration, and, stock, fraud, to, back, de, forest, s, efforts, white, incorporated, the, american, deforest, wireless, telegraph, company, with, himself, as, the, company, s, president, and, de, forest, the, scientific, director, the, company, claimed, as, its, goal, the, development, of, world, wide, wireless, the, original, responder, receiver, also, known, as, the, goo, anti, coherer, proved, to, be, too, crude, to, be, commercialized, and, de, forest, struggled, to, develop, a, non, infringing, device, for, receiving, radio, signals, in, 1903, reginald, fessenden, demonstrated, an, electrolytic, detector, and, de, forest, developed, a, variation, which, he, called, the, spade, detector, claiming, it, did, not, infringe, on, fessenden, s, patents, fessenden, and, the, u, s, courts, did, not, agree, and, court, injunctions, enjoined, american, de, forest, from, using, the, device, meanwhile, white, set, in, motion, a, series, of, highly, visible, promotions, for, american, deforest, wireless, auto, no, 1, was, positioned, on, wall, street, to, send, stock, quotes, using, an, unmuffled, spark, transmitter, to, loudly, draw, the, attention, of, potential, investors, in, early, 1904, two, stations, were, established, at, wei, hai, wei, on, the, chinese, mainland, and, aboard, the, chinese, steamer, ss, haimun, which, allowed, war, correspondent, captain, lionel, james, of, the, times, of, london, to, report, on, the, brewing, russo, japanese, war, and, later, that, year, a, tower, with, deforest, arrayed, in, lights, was, erected, on, the, grounds, of, the, louisiana, purchase, exposition, in, saint, louis, missouri, where, the, company, won, a, gold, medal, for, its, radiotelegraph, demonstrations, marconi, withdrew, from, the, exposition, when, he, learned, de, forest, would, be, there, the, company, s, most, important, early, contract, was, the, construction, in, 1905, 1906, of, five, high, powered, radiotelegraph, stations, for, the, u, s, navy, located, in, panama, pensacola, and, key, west, florida, guantanamo, cuba, and, puerto, rico, it, also, installed, shore, stations, along, the, atlantic, coast, and, great, lakes, and, equipped, shipboard, stations, but, the, main, focus, was, selling, stock, at, ever, more, inflated, prices, spurred, by, the, construction, of, promotional, inland, stations, most, of, these, inland, stations, had, no, practical, use, and, were, abandoned, once, the, local, stock, sales, slowed, de, forest, eventually, came, into, conflict, with, his, company, s, management, his, main, complaint, was, the, limited, support, he, got, for, conducting, research, while, company, officials, were, upset, with, de, forest, s, inability, to, develop, a, practical, receiver, free, of, patent, infringement, this, problem, was, finally, resolved, with, the, invention, of, the, carborundum, crystal, detector, by, another, company, employee, general, henry, harrison, chase, dunwoody, on, november, 28, 1906, in, exchange, for, 1000, half, of, which, was, claimed, by, an, attorney, and, the, rights, to, some, early, audion, detector, patents, de, forest, turned, in, his, stock, and, resigned, from, the, company, that, bore, his, name, american, deforest, was, then, reorganized, as, the, united, wireless, telegraph, company, and, would, be, the, dominant, u, s, radio, communications, firm, albeit, propped, up, by, massive, stock, fraud, until, its, bankruptcy, in, 1912, de, forest, moved, quickly, to, re, establish, himself, as, an, independent, inventor, working, in, his, own, laboratory, in, the, parker, building, in, new, york, city, the, radio, telephone, company, was, incorporated, in, order, to, promote, his, inventions, with, james, dunlop, smith, a, former, american, deforest, salesman, as, president, and, de, forest, the, vice, president, de, forest, preferred, the, term, radio, which, up, to, now, had, been, primarily, used, in, europe, over, wireless, at, the, 1904, louisiana, purchase, exposition, valdemar, poulsen, had, presented, a, paper, on, an, arc, transmitter, which, unlike, the, discontinuous, pulses, produced, by, spark, transmitters, created, steady, continuous, wave, signals, that, could, be, used, for, amplitude, modulated, am, audio, transmissions, although, poulsen, had, patented, his, invention, de, forest, claimed, to, have, come, up, with, a, variation, that, allowed, him, to, avoid, infringing, on, poulsen, s, work, using, his, sparkless, arc, transmitter, de, forest, first, transmitted, audio, across, a, lab, room, on, december, 31, 1906, and, by, february, was, making, experimental, transmissions, including, music, produced, by, thaddeus, cahill, s, telharmonium, that, were, heard, throughout, the, city, on, july, 18, 1907, de, forest, made, the, first, ship, to, shore, transmissions, by, radiotelephone, race, reports, for, the, annual, inter, lakes, yachting, association, i, lya, regatta, held, on, lake, erie, which, were, sent, from, the, steam, yacht, thelma, to, his, assistant, frank, e, butler, located, in, the, fox, s, dock, pavilion, on, south, bass, island, de, forest, also, interested, the, u, s, navy, in, his, radiotelephone, which, placed, a, rush, order, to, have, 26, arc, sets, installed, for, its, great, white, fleet, around, the, world, voyage, that, began, in, late, 1907, however, at, the, conclusion, of, the, circumnavigation, the, sets, were, declared, to, be, too, unreliable, to, meet, the, navy, s, needs, and, removed, the, company, set, up, a, network, of, radiotelephone, stations, along, the, atlantic, coast, and, the, great, lakes, for, coastal, ship, navigation, however, the, installations, proved, unprofitable, and, by, 1911, the, parent, company, and, its, subsidiaries, were, on, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, de, forest, also, used, the, arc, transmitter, to, conduct, some, of, the, earliest, experimental, entertainment, radio, broadcasts, eugenia, farrar, sang, i, love, you, truly, in, an, unpublicized, test, from, his, laboratory, in, 1907, and, in, 1908, on, de, forest, s, paris, honeymoon, musical, selections, were, broadcast, from, the, eiffel, tower, as, a, part, of, demonstrations, of, the, arc, transmitter, in, early, 1909, in, what, may, have, been, the, first, public, speech, by, radio, de, forest, s, mother, in, law, harriot, stanton, blatch, made, a, broadcast, supporting, women, s, suffrage, more, ambitious, demonstrations, followed, a, series, of, tests, in, conjunction, with, the, metropolitan, opera, house, in, new, york, city, were, conducted, to, determine, whether, it, was, practical, to, broadcast, opera, performances, live, from, the, stage, tosca, was, performed, on, january, 12, 1910, and, the, next, day, s, test, included, italian, tenor, enrico, caruso, on, february, 24, the, manhattan, opera, company, s, mme, mariette, mazarin, sang, la, habanera, from, carmen, and, selections, from, the, controversial, elektra, over, a, transmitter, located, in, de, forest, s, lab, but, these, tests, showed, that, the, idea, was, not, yet, technically, feasible, and, de, forest, would, not, make, any, additional, entertainment, broadcasts, until, late, 1916, when, more, capable, vacuum, tube, equipment, became, available, de, forest, s, most, famous, invention, was, the, grid, audion, which, was, the, first, successful, three, element, triode, vacuum, tube, and, the, first, device, which, could, amplify, electrical, signals, he, traced, its, inspiration, to, 1900, when, experimenting, with, a, spark, gap, transmitter, he, briefly, thought, that, the, flickering, of, a, nearby, gas, flame, might, be, in, response, to, electromagnetic, pulses, with, further, tests, he, soon, determined, that, the, cause, of, the, flame, fluctuations, was, due, to, air, pressure, changes, produced, by, the, loud, sound, of, the, spark, still, he, was, intrigued, by, the, idea, that, properly, configured, it, might, be, possible, to, use, a, flame, or, something, similar, to, detect, radio, signals, after, determining, that, an, open, flame, was, too, susceptible, to, ambient, air, currents, de, forest, investigated, whether, ionized, gases, heated, and, enclosed, in, a, partially, evacuated, glass, tube, could, be, used, instead, in, 1905, to, 1906, he, developed, various, configurations, of, glass, tube, devices, which, he, gave, the, general, name, of, audions, the, first, audions, had, only, two, electrodes, and, on, october, 25, 1906, de, forest, filed, a, patent, for, the, diode, vacuum, tube, detector, that, was, granted, u, s, patent, number, 841387, on, january, 15, 1907, subsequently, a, third, control, electrode, was, added, originally, as, a, surrounding, metal, cylinder, or, a, wire, coiled, around, the, outside, of, the, glass, tube, none, of, these, initial, designs, worked, particularly, well, de, forest, gave, a, presentation, of, his, work, to, date, to, the, october, 26, 1906, new, york, meeting, of, the, american, institute, of, electrical, engineers, which, was, reprinted, in, two, parts, in, late, 1907, in, the, scientific, american, supplement, he, was, insistent, that, a, small, amount, of, residual, gas, was, necessary, for, the, tubes, to, operate, properly, however, he, also, admitted, that, i, have, arrived, as, yet, at, no, completely, satisfactory, theory, as, to, the, exact, means, by, which, the, high, frequency, oscillations, affect, so, markedly, the, behavior, of, an, ionized, gas, in, late, 1906, de, forest, made, a, breakthrough, when, he, reconfigured, the, control, electrode, moving, it, from, outside, the, tube, envelope, to, a, position, inside, the, tube, between, the, filament, and, the, plate, he, called, the, intermediate, electrode, a, grid, reportedly, due, to, its, similarity, to, the, gridiron, lines, on, american, football, playing, fields, experiments, conducted, with, his, assistant, john, v, l, hogan, convinced, him, that, he, had, discovered, an, important, new, radio, detector, he, quickly, prepared, a, patent, application, which, was, filed, on, january, 29, 1907, and, received, u, s, patent, 879, 532, on, february, 18, 1908, because, the, grid, control, audion, was, the, only, configuration, to, become, commercially, valuable, the, earlier, versions, were, forgotten, and, the, term, audion, later, became, synonymous, with, just, the, grid, type, it, later, also, became, known, as, the, triode, the, grid, audion, was, the, first, device, to, amplify, albeit, only, slightly, the, strength, of, received, radio, signals, however, to, many, observers, it, appeared, that, de, forest, had, done, nothing, more, than, add, the, grid, electrode, to, an, existing, detector, configuration, the, fleming, valve, which, also, consisted, of, a, filament, and, plate, enclosed, in, an, evacuated, glass, tube, de, forest, passionately, denied, the, similarly, of, the, two, devices, claiming, his, invention, was, a, relay, that, amplified, currents, while, the, fleming, valve, was, merely, a, rectifier, that, converted, alternating, current, to, direct, current, for, this, reason, de, forest, objected, to, his, audion, being, referred, to, as, a, valve, the, u, s, courts, were, not, convinced, and, ruled, that, the, grid, audion, did, in, fact, infringe, on, the, fleming, valve, patent, now, held, by, marconi, in, contrast, marconi, admitted, that, the, addition, of, the, third, electrode, was, a, patentable, improvement, and, the, two, sides, agreed, to, license, each, other, so, that, both, could, manufacture, three, electrode, tubes, in, the, united, states, de, forest, s, european, patents, had, lapsed, because, he, did, not, have, the, funds, needed, to, renew, them, because, of, its, limited, uses, and, the, great, variability, in, the, quality, of, individual, units, the, grid, audion, would, be, rarely, used, during, the, first, half, decade, after, its, invention, in, 1908, john, v, l, hogan, reported, that, the, audion, is, capable, of, being, developed, into, a, really, efficient, detector, but, in, its, present, forms, is, quite, unreliable, and, entirely, too, complex, to, be, properly, handled, by, the, usual, wireless, operator, in, may, 1910, the, radio, telephone, company, and, its, subsidiaries, were, reorganized, as, the, north, american, wireless, corporation, but, financial, difficulties, meant, that, the, company, s, activities, had, nearly, come, to, a, halt, de, forest, moved, to, san, francisco, california, and, in, early, 1911, took, a, research, job, at, the, federal, telegraph, company, which, produced, long, range, radiotelegraph, systems, using, high, powered, poulsen, arcs, one, of, de, forest, s, areas, of, research, at, federal, telegraph, was, improving, the, reception, of, signals, and, he, came, up, with, the, idea, of, strengthening, the, audio, frequency, output, from, a, grid, audion, by, feeding, it, into, a, second, tube, for, additional, amplification, he, called, this, a, cascade, amplifier, which, eventually, consisted, of, chaining, together, up, to, three, audions, at, this, time, the, american, telephone, and, telegraph, company, was, researching, ways, to, amplify, telephone, signals, to, provide, better, long, distance, service, and, it, was, recognized, that, de, forest, s, device, had, potential, as, a, telephone, line, repeater, in, mid, 1912, an, associate, john, stone, stone, contacted, at, t, to, arrange, for, de, forest, to, demonstrate, his, invention, it, was, found, that, de, forest, s, gassy, version, of, the, audion, could, not, handle, even, the, relatively, low, voltages, used, by, telephone, lines, owing, to, the, way, he, constructed, the, tubes, de, forest, s, audions, would, cease, to, operate, with, too, high, a, vacuum, however, careful, research, by, dr, harold, d, arnold, and, his, team, at, at, t, s, western, electric, subsidiary, determined, that, improving, the, tube, s, design, would, allow, it, to, be, more, fully, evacuated, and, the, high, vacuum, allowed, it, to, operate, at, telephone, line, voltages, with, these, changes, the, audion, evolved, into, a, modern, electron, discharge, vacuum, tube, using, electron, flows, rather, than, ions, dr, irving, langmuir, at, the, general, electric, corporation, made, similar, findings, and, both, he, and, arnold, attempted, to, patent, the, high, vacuum, construction, but, the, u, s, supreme, court, ruled, in, 1931, that, this, modification, could, not, be, patented, after, a, delay, of, ten, months, in, july, 1913, at, t, through, a, third, party, who, disguised, his, link, to, the, telephone, company, purchased, the, wire, rights, to, seven, audion, patents, for, 50, 000, de, forest, had, hoped, for, a, higher, payment, but, was, again, in, bad, financial, shape, and, was, unable, to, bargain, for, more, in, 1915, at, t, used, the, innovation, to, conduct, the, first, transcontinental, telephone, calls, in, conjunction, with, the, panama, pacific, international, exposition, at, san, francisco, radio, telephone, company, officials, had, engaged, in, some, of, the, same, stock, selling, excesses, that, had, taken, place, at, american, deforest, and, as, part, of, the, u, s, government, s, crackdown, on, stock, fraud, in, march, 1912, de, forest, plus, four, other, company, officials, were, arrested, and, charged, with, use, of, the, mails, to, defraud, their, trials, took, place, in, late, 1913, and, while, three, of, the, defendants, were, found, guilty, de, forest, was, acquitted, with, the, legal, problems, behind, him, de, forest, reorganized, his, company, as, the, deforest, radio, telephone, company, and, established, a, laboratory, at, 1391, sedgewick, avenue, in, the, highbridge, section, of, the, bronx, in, new, york, city, the, company, s, limited, finances, were, boosted, by, the, sale, in, october, 1914, of, the, commercial, audion, patent, rights, for, radio, signalling, to, at, t, for, 90, 000, with, de, forest, retaining, the, rights, for, sales, for, amateur, and, experimental, use, in, october, 1915, at, t, conducted, test, radio, transmissions, from, the, navy, s, station, in, arlington, virginia, that, were, heard, as, far, away, as, paris, and, hawaii, the, radio, telephone, company, began, selling, oscillion, power, tubes, to, amateurs, suitable, for, radio, transmissions, the, company, wanted, to, keep, a, tight, hold, on, the, tube, business, and, originally, maintained, a, policy, that, retailers, had, to, require, their, customers, to, return, a, worn, out, tube, before, they, could, get, a, replacement, this, style, of, business, encouraged, others, to, make, and, sell, unlicensed, vacuum, tubes, which, did, not, impose, a, return, policy, one, of, the, boldest, was, audio, tron, sales, company, founded, in, 1915, by, elmer, t, cunningham, of, san, francisco, whose, audio, tron, tubes, cost, less, but, were, of, equal, or, higher, quality, the, de, forest, company, sued, audio, tron, sales, eventually, settling, out, of, court, in, april, 1917, the, company, s, remaining, commercial, radio, patent, rights, were, sold, to, at, t, s, western, electric, subsidiary, for, 250, 000, during, world, war, i, the, radio, telephone, company, prospered, from, sales, of, radio, equipment, to, the, military, however, it, also, became, known, for, the, poor, quality, of, its, vacuum, tubes, especially, compared, to, those, produced, by, major, industrial, manufacturers, such, as, general, electric, and, western, electric, beginning, in, 1912, there, was, increased, investigation, of, vacuum, tube, capabilities, simultaneously, by, numerous, inventors, in, multiple, countries, who, identified, additional, important, uses, for, the, device, these, overlapping, discoveries, led, to, complicated, legal, disputes, over, priority, perhaps, the, most, bitter, being, one, in, the, united, states, between, de, forest, and, edwin, howard, armstrong, over, the, discovery, of, regeneration, also, known, as, the, feedback, circuit, and, by, de, forest, as, the, ultra, audion, beginning, in, 1913, armstrong, prepared, papers, and, gave, demonstrations, that, comprehensively, documented, how, to, employ, three, element, vacuum, tubes, in, circuits, that, amplified, signals, to, stronger, levels, than, previously, thought, possible, and, that, could, also, generate, high, power, oscillations, usable, for, radio, transmission, in, late, 1913, armstrong, applied, for, patents, covering, the, regenerative, circuit, and, on, october, 6, 1914, u, s, patent, 1, 113, 149, was, issued, for, his, discovery, u, s, patent, law, included, a, provision, for, challenging, grants, if, another, inventor, could, prove, prior, discovery, with, an, eye, to, increasing, the, value, of, the, patent, portfolio, that, would, be, sold, to, western, electric, in, 1917, beginning, in, 1915, de, forest, filed, a, series, of, patent, applications, that, largely, copied, armstrong, s, claims, in, the, hopes, of, having, the, priority, of, the, competing, applications, upheld, by, an, interference, hearing, at, the, patent, office, based, on, a, notebook, entry, recorded, at, the, time, de, forest, asserted, that, while, working, on, the, cascade, amplifier, he, had, stumbled, on, august, 6, 1912, across, the, feedback, principle, which, was, then, used, in, the, spring, of, 1913, to, operate, a, low, powered, transmitter, for, heterodyne, reception, of, federal, telegraph, arc, transmissions, however, there, was, also, strong, evidence, that, de, forest, was, unaware, of, the, full, significance, of, this, discovery, as, shown, by, his, lack, of, follow, up, and, continuing, misunderstanding, of, the, physics, involved, in, particular, it, appeared, that, he, was, unaware, of, the, potential, for, further, development, until, he, became, familiar, with, armstrong, s, research, de, forest, was, not, alone, in, the, interference, determination, the, patent, office, identified, four, competing, claimants, for, its, hearings, consisting, of, armstrong, de, forest, general, electric, s, langmuir, and, a, german, alexander, meissner, whose, application, would, be, seized, by, the, office, of, alien, property, custodian, during, world, war, i, the, subsequent, legal, proceedings, become, divided, between, two, groups, of, court, cases, the, first, court, action, began, in, january, 1920, when, armstrong, with, westinghouse, which, purchased, his, patent, sued, the, de, forest, company, in, district, court, for, infringement, of, patent, 1, 113, 149, on, may, 17, 1921, the, court, ruled, that, the, lack, of, awareness, and, understanding, on, de, forest, s, part, in, addition, to, the, fact, that, he, had, made, no, immediate, advances, beyond, his, initial, observation, made, implausible, his, attempt, to, prevail, as, inventor, however, a, second, series, of, court, cases, which, were, the, result, of, the, patent, office, interference, proceeding, had, a, different, outcome, the, interference, board, had, also, sided, with, armstrong, and, de, forest, appealed, its, decision, to, the, district, of, columbia, district, court, on, may, 8, 1924, that, court, concluded, that, the, evidence, beginning, with, the, 1912, notebook, entry, was, sufficient, to, establish, de, forest, s, priority, now, on, the, defensive, armstrong, s, side, tried, to, overturn, the, decision, but, these, efforts, which, twice, went, before, the, u, s, supreme, court, in, 1928, and, 1934, were, unsuccessful, this, judicial, ruling, meant, that, lee, de, forest, was, now, legally, recognized, in, the, united, states, as, the, inventor, of, regeneration, however, much, of, the, engineering, community, continued, to, consider, armstrong, to, be, the, actual, developer, with, de, forest, viewed, as, someone, who, skillfully, used, the, patent, system, to, get, credit, for, an, invention, to, which, he, had, barely, contributed, following, the, 1934, supreme, court, decision, armstrong, attempted, to, return, his, institute, of, radio, engineers, present, day, institute, of, electrical, and, electronics, engineers, medal, of, honor, which, had, been, awarded, to, him, in, 1917, in, recognition, of, his, work, and, publications, dealing, with, the, action, of, the, oscillating, and, non, oscillating, audion, but, the, organization, s, board, refused, to, let, him, stating, that, it, strongly, affirms, the, original, award, the, practical, effect, of, de, forest, s, victory, was, that, his, company, was, free, to, sell, products, that, used, regeneration, for, during, the, controversy, which, became, more, a, personal, feud, than, a, business, dispute, armstrong, tried, to, block, the, company, from, even, being, licensed, to, sell, equipment, under, his, patent, de, forest, regularly, responded, to, articles, which, he, thought, exaggerated, armstrong, s, contributions, with, animosity, that, continued, even, after, armstrong, s, 1954, suicide, following, the, publication, of, carl, dreher, s, e, h, armstrong, the, hero, as, inventor, in, the, august, 1956, harper, s, magazine, de, forest, wrote, the, author, describing, armstrong, as, exceedingly, arrogant, brow, beating, even, brutal, and, defending, the, supreme, court, decision, in, his, favor, in, the, summer, of, 1915, the, company, received, an, experimental, license, for, station, 2xg, located, at, its, highbridge, laboratory, in, late, 1916, de, forest, renewed, the, entertainment, broadcasts, he, had, suspended, in, 1910, now, using, the, superior, capabilities, of, vacuum, tube, equipment, 2xg, s, debut, program, aired, on, october, 26, 1916, as, part, of, an, arrangement, with, the, columbia, graphophone, company, to, promote, its, recordings, which, included, announcing, the, title, and, columbia, gramophone, company, with, each, playing, beginning, november, 1, the, highbridge, station, offered, a, nightly, schedule, featuring, the, columbia, recordings, these, broadcasts, were, also, used, to, advertise, the, products, of, the, deforest, radio, co, mostly, the, radio, parts, with, all, the, zeal, of, our, catalogue, and, price, list, until, comments, by, western, electric, engineers, caused, de, forest, enough, embarrassment, to, make, him, decide, to, eliminate, the, direct, advertising, the, station, also, made, the, first, audio, broadcast, of, election, reports, in, earlier, elections, stations, that, broadcast, results, had, used, morse, code, providing, news, of, the, november, 1916, wilson, hughes, presidential, election, the, new, york, american, installed, a, private, wire, and, bulletins, were, sent, out, every, hour, about, 2, 000, listeners, heard, the, star, spangled, banner, and, other, anthems, songs, and, hymns, with, the, entry, of, the, united, states, into, world, war, i, on, april, 6, 1917, all, civilian, radio, stations, were, ordered, to, shut, down, so, 2xg, was, silenced, for, the, duration, of, the, war, the, ban, on, civilian, stations, was, lifted, on, october, 1, 1919, and, 2xg, soon, renewed, operation, with, the, brunswick, balke, collender, company, now, supplying, the, phonograph, records, in, early, 1920, de, forest, moved, the, station, s, transmitter, from, the, bronx, to, manhattan, but, did, not, have, permission, to, do, so, so, district, radio, inspector, arthur, batcheller, ordered, the, station, off, the, air, de, forest, s, response, was, to, return, to, san, francisco, in, march, taking, 2xg, s, transmitter, with, him, a, new, station, 6xc, was, established, as, the, california, theater, station, which, de, forest, later, stated, was, the, first, radio, telephone, station, devoted, solely, to, broadcasting, to, the, public, later, that, year, a, de, forest, associate, clarence, c, s, thompson, established, radio, news, music, inc, in, order, to, lease, de, forest, radio, transmitters, to, newspapers, interested, in, setting, up, their, own, broadcasting, stations, in, august, 1920, the, detroit, news, began, operation, of, the, detroit, news, radiophone, initially, with, the, callsign, 8mk, which, later, became, broadcasting, station, wwj, in, 1921, de, forest, ended, most, of, his, radio, research, in, order, to, concentrate, on, developing, an, optical, sound, on, film, process, called, phonofilm, in, 1919, he, filed, the, first, patent, for, the, new, system, which, improved, upon, earlier, work, by, finnish, inventor, eric, tigerstedt, and, the, german, partnership, tri, ergon, phonofilm, recorded, the, electrical, waveforms, produced, by, a, microphone, photographically, onto, film, using, parallel, lines, of, variable, shades, of, gray, an, approach, known, as, variable, density, in, contrast, to, variable, area, systems, used, by, processes, such, as, rca, photophone, when, the, movie, film, was, projected, the, recorded, information, was, converted, back, into, sound, in, synchronization, with, the, picture, from, october, 1921, to, september, 1922, de, forest, lived, in, berlin, germany, meeting, the, tri, ergon, developers, german, inventors, josef, engl, 1893, 1942, hans, vogt, 1890, 1979, and, joseph, massolle, 1889, 1957, and, investigating, other, european, sound, film, systems, in, april, 1922, he, announced, that, he, would, soon, have, a, workable, sound, on, film, system, on, march, 12, 1923, he, demonstrated, phonofilm, to, the, press, this, was, followed, on, april, 12, 1923, by, a, private, demonstration, to, electrical, engineers, at, the, engineering, society, building, s, auditorium, at, 33, west, 39th, street, in, new, york, city, in, november, 1922, de, forest, established, the, de, forest, phonofilm, company, located, at, 314, east, 48th, street, in, new, york, city, but, none, of, the, hollywood, movie, studios, expressed, interest, in, his, invention, and, because, at, this, time, these, studios, controlled, all, the, major, theater, chains, this, meant, de, forest, was, limited, to, showing, his, experimental, films, in, independent, theaters, the, phonofilm, company, would, file, for, bankruptcy, in, september, 1926, after, recording, stage, performances, such, as, in, vaudeville, speeches, and, musical, acts, on, april, 15, 1923, de, forest, premiered, 18, phonofilm, short, films, at, the, independent, rivoli, theater, in, new, york, city, starting, in, may, 1924, max, and, dave, fleischer, used, the, phonofilm, process, for, their, song, car, tune, series, of, cartoons, featuring, the, follow, the, bouncing, ball, gimmick, however, de, forest, s, choice, of, primarily, filming, short, vaudeville, acts, instead, of, full, length, features, limited, the, appeal, of, phonofilm, to, hollywood, studios, de, forest, also, worked, with, freeman, harrison, owens, and, theodore, case, using, their, work, to, perfect, the, phonofilm, system, however, de, forest, had, a, falling, out, with, both, men, due, to, de, forest, s, continuing, misuse, of, theodore, case, s, inventions, and, failure, to, publicly, acknowledge, case, s, contributions, the, case, research, laboratory, proceeded, to, build, its, own, camera, that, camera, was, used, by, case, and, his, colleague, earl, sponable, to, record, calvin, coolidge, on, august, 11, 1924, which, was, one, of, the, films, shown, by, de, forest, and, claimed, by, him, to, be, the, product, of, his, inventions, believing, that, de, forest, was, more, concerned, with, his, own, fame, and, recognition, than, he, was, with, actually, creating, a, workable, system, of, sound, film, and, because, of, his, continuing, attempts, to, downplay, the, contributions, of, the, case, research, laboratory, in, the, creation, of, phonofilm, case, severed, his, ties, with, de, forest, in, the, fall, of, 1925, case, successfully, negotiated, an, agreement, to, use, his, patents, with, studio, head, william, fox, owner, of, fox, film, corporation, who, marketed, the, innovation, as, fox, movietone, warner, brothers, introduced, a, competing, method, for, sound, film, the, vitaphone, sound, on, disc, process, developed, by, western, electric, with, the, august, 6, 1926, release, of, the, john, barrymore, film, don, juan, in, 1927, and, 1928, hollywood, expanded, its, use, of, sound, on, film, systems, including, fox, movietone, and, rca, photophone, meanwhile, theater, chain, owner, isadore, schlesinger, purchased, the, uk, rights, to, phonofilm, and, released, short, films, of, british, music, hall, performers, from, september, 1926, to, may, 1929, almost, 200, phonofilm, shorts, were, made, and, many, are, preserved, in, the, collections, of, the, library, of, congress, and, the, british, film, institute, in, april, 1923, the, de, forest, radio, telephone, telegraph, company, which, manufactured, de, forest, s, audions, for, commercial, use, was, sold, to, a, group, headed, by, edward, jewett, of, jewett, paige, motors, which, expanded, the, company, s, factory, to, cope, with, rising, demand, for, radios, the, sale, also, bought, the, services, of, de, forest, who, was, focusing, his, attention, on, newer, innovations, de, forest, s, finances, were, badly, hurt, by, the, stock, market, crash, of, 1929, and, research, in, mechanical, television, proved, unprofitable, in, 1934, he, established, a, small, shop, to, produce, diathermy, machines, and, in, a, 1942, interview, still, hoped, to, make, at, least, one, more, great, invention, de, forest, was, a, vocal, critic, of, many, of, the, developments, in, the, entertainment, side, of, the, radio, industry, in, 1940, he, sent, an, open, letter, to, the, national, association, of, broadcasters, in, which, he, demanded, what, have, you, done, with, my, child, the, radio, broadcast, you, have, debased, this, child, dressed, him, in, rags, of, ragtime, tatters, of, jive, and, boogie, woogie, that, same, year, de, forest, and, early, tv, engineer, ulises, armand, sanabria, presented, the, concept, of, a, primitive, unmanned, combat, air, vehicle, using, a, television, camera, and, a, jam, resistant, radio, control, in, a, popular, mechanics, issue, in, 1950, his, autobiography, father, of, radio, was, published, although, it, sold, poorly, de, forest, was, the, guest, celebrity, on, the, may, 22, 1957, episode, of, the, television, show, this, is, your, life, where, he, was, introduced, as, the, father, of, radio, and, the, grandfather, of, television, he, suffered, a, severe, heart, attack, in, 1958, after, which, he, remained, mostly, bedridden, he, died, in, hollywood, on, june, 30, 1961, aged, 87, and, was, interred, in, san, fernando, mission, cemetery, in, los, angeles, california, de, forest, died, relatively, poor, with, just, 1, 250, in, his, bank, account, the, grid, audion, which, de, forest, called, my, greatest, invention, and, the, vacuum, tubes, developed, from, it, dominated, the, field, of, electronics, for, forty, years, making, possible, long, distance, telephone, service, radio, broadcasting, television, and, many, other, applications, it, could, also, be, used, as, an, electronic, switching, element, and, was, later, used, in, early, digital, electronics, including, the, first, electronic, computers, although, the, 1948, invention, of, the, transistor, would, lead, to, microchips, that, eventually, supplanted, vacuum, tube, technology, for, this, reason, de, forest, has, been, called, one, of, the, founders, of, the, electronic, age, according, to, donald, beaver, his, intense, desire, to, overcome, the, deficiencies, of, his, childhood, account, for, his, independence, self, reliance, and, inventiveness, he, displayed, a, strong, desire, to, achieve, to, conquer, hardship, and, to, devote, himself, to, a, career, of, invention, he, possessed, the, qualities, of, the, traditional, tinkerer, inventor, visionary, faith, self, confidence, perseverance, the, capacity, for, sustained, hard, work, de, forest, s, archives, were, donated, by, his, widow, to, the, perham, electronic, foundation, which, in, 1973, opened, the, foothills, electronics, museum, at, foothill, college, in, los, altos, hills, california, in, 1991, the, college, closed, the, museum, breaking, its, contract, the, foundation, won, a, lawsuit, and, was, awarded, 775, 000, the, holdings, were, placed, in, storage, for, twelve, years, before, being, acquired, in, 2003, by, history, san, jos, and, put, on, display, as, the, perham, collection, of, early, electronics, de, forest, was, married, four, times, with, the, first, three, marriages, ending, in, divorce, de, forest, was, a, conservative, republican, and, fervent, anti, communist, and, anti, fascist, in, 1932, in, the, midst, of, the, great, depression, he, voted, for, franklin, roosevelt, but, later, came, to, resent, him, calling, roosevelt, america, s, first, fascist, president, in, 1949, he, sent, letters, to, all, members, of, congress, urging, them, to, vote, against, socialized, medicine, federally, subsidized, housing, and, an, excess, profits, tax, in, 1952, he, wrote, to, the, newly, elected, vice, president, richard, nixon, urging, him, to, prosecute, with, renewed, vigor, your, valiant, fight, to, put, out, communism, from, every, branch, of, our, government, in, december, 1953, he, cancelled, his, subscription, to, the, nation, accusing, it, of, being, lousy, with, treason, crawling, with, communism, although, raised, in, a, strongly, religious, protestant, household, de, forest, later, became, an, agnostic, in, his, autobiography, he, wrote, that, in, the, summer, of, 1894, there, was, an, important, shift, in, his, beliefs, through, that, freshman, vacation, at, yale, i, became, more, of, a, philosopher, than, i, have, ever, since, and, thus, one, by, one, were, my, childhood, s, firm, religious, beliefs, altered, or, reluctantly, discarded, de, forest, was, given, to, expansive, predictions, many, of, which, were, not, borne, out, but, he, also, made, many, correct, predictions, including, microwave, communication, and, cooking, patent, images, in, tiff, format
