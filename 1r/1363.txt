a, lack, of, any, specific, recollection, of, a, romance, between, the, two, rutledge, died, on, august, 25, 1835, most, likely, of, typhoid, fever, lincoln, took, the, death, very, hard, saying, that, he, could, not, bear, the, idea, of, rain, falling, on, ann, s, grave, lincoln, sank, into, a, serious, episode, of, depression, and, this, gave, rise, to, speculation, that, he, had, been, in, love, with, her, in, the, early, 1830s, he, met, mary, owens, from, kentucky, late, in, 1836, lincoln, agreed, to, a, match, with, owens, if, she, returned, to, new, salem, owens, arrived, that,

irritated, when, lincoln, brought, his, children, to, the, law, office, their, father, it, seemed, was, often, too, absorbed, in, his, work, to, notice, his, children, s, behavior, herndon, recounted, i, have, felt, many, and, many, a, time, that, i, wanted, to, wring, their, little, necks, and, yet, out, of, respect, for, lincoln, i, kept, my, mouth, shut, lincoln, did, not, note, what, his,

as, a, captain, in, the, illinois, militia, during, the, black, hawk, war, when, lincoln, returned, home, from, the, war, he, planned, to, become, a, blacksmith, but, instead, formed, a, partnership, with, 21, year, old, william, berry, with, whom, he, purchased, a, new, salem, general, store, on, credit, because, a, license, was, required, to, sell, customers, beverages, berry, obtained, bartending, licenses, for, 7, each, for, lincoln, and, himself, and, in, 1833, the, lincoln, berry, general, store, became, a, tavern, as, well, as, licensed, bartenders, lincoln, and, berry, were, able, to, sell, spirits, including, liquor, for, 12, cents, a, pint, they, offered, a, wide, range, of, alcoholic, beverages, as, well, as, food, including, takeout, dinners, but, berry, became, an, alcoholic, was, often, too, drunk, to, work, and, lincoln, ended, up, running, the, store, by, himself, although, the, economy, was, booming, the, business, struggled, and, went, into, debt, causing, lincoln, to, sell, his, share, to, berry, in, his, first, campaign, speech, after, returning, from, his, military, service, lincoln, observed, a, supporter, in, the, crowd, under, attack, grabbed, the, assailant, by, his, neck, and, the, seat, of, his, trousers, and, tossed, him, in, the, campaign, lincoln, advocated, for, navigational, improvements, on, the, sangamon, river, he, could, draw,

were, elected, though, he, received, 277, of, the, 300, votes, cast, in, the, new, salem, precinct, lincoln, served, as, new, salem, s, postmaster, and, later, as, county, surveyor, but, continued, his, voracious, reading, and, decided, to, become, a, lawyer, rather, than, studying, in, the, office, of, an, established, attorney, as, was, the, custom, lincoln, borrowed, legal, texts, from, attorneys, john, todd, stuart, and, thomas, drummond, purchased, books, including, blackstone, s, commentaries, and, chitty, s, pleadings, and, read, law, on, his, own, he, later, said, of, his, legal, education, that, i, studied, with, nobody, lincoln, s, second, state, house, campaign, in, 1834, this, time, as, a, whig, was, a, success, over, a, powerful, whig, opponent, then, followed,

of, slavery, is, founded, on, both, injustice, and, bad, policy, but, the, promulgation, of, abolition, doctrines, tends, rather, to, increase, than, abate, its, evils, he, echoed, henry, clay, s,

be, its, author, and, finisher, said, lincoln, prior, to, that, on, april, 28, 1836, a, black, man, francis, mcintosh, was, burned, alive, in, st, louis, missouri, zann, gill, describes, how, these, two, murders, set, off, a, chain, reaction, that, ultimately, prompted, abraham, lincoln, to, run, for, president, true, to, his, record, lincoln, professed, to, friends, in, 1861, to, be, an, old, line, whig, a, disciple, of, henry, clay, their, party, favored, economic, modernization, in, banking, tariffs, to, fund, internal, improvements, including, railroads, and, urbanization, in, 1843, lincoln, sought, the, whig, nomination, for, illinois, s, 7th, district, seat, in, the, u, s, house, of, representatives, he, was, defeated, by, john, j, hardin, though, he, prevailed, with, the, party, in, limiting, hardin, to, one, term, lincoln, not, only, pulled, off, his, strategy, of, gaining, the, nomination, in, 1846, but, also, won, the, election, he, was, the, only, whig, in, the, illinois, delegation, but, as, dutiful, as, any, participated, in, almost, all, votes, and, made, speeches, that, toed, the, party, line, he, was, assigned, to, the, committee, on, post, office, and, post, roads, and, the, committee, on, expenditures, in, the, war, department, lincoln, teamed, with, joshua, r, giddings, on, a, bill, to, abolish, slavery, in, the, district, of, columbia, with, compensation, for, the, owners, enforcement, to, capture, fugitive, slaves, and, a, popular, vote, on, the, matter, he, dropped, the, bill, when, it, eluded, whig, support, on, foreign, and, military, policy, lincoln, spoke, against, the, mexican, american, war, which, he, imputed, president, james, k, polk, s, desire, for, military, glory, that, attractive, rainbow, that, rises, in, showers, of, blood, he, supported, the, wilmot, proviso, a, failed, proposal, to, ban, slavery, in, any, u, s, territory, won, from, mexico, lincoln, emphasized, his, opposition, to, polk, by, drafting, and, introducing, his, spot, resolutions, the, war, had, begun, with, a, killing, of, american, soldiers, by, mexican, cavalry, patrol, in, disputed, territory, and, polk, insisted, that, mexican, soldiers, had, invaded, our, territory, and, shed, the, blood, of, our, fellow, citizens, on, our, own, soil, lincoln, demanded, that, polk, show, congress, the, exact, spot, on, which, blood, had, been, shed, and, prove, that, the, spot, was, on, american, soil, the, resolution, was, ignored, in, both, congress, and, the, national, papers, and, it, cost, lincoln, political, support, in, his, district, one, illinois, newspaper, derisively, nicknamed, him, spotty, lincoln, lincoln, later, regretted, some, of, his, statements, especially, his, attack, on, presidential, war, making, powers, lincoln, had, pledged, in, 1846, to, serve, only, one, term, in, the, house, realizing, clay, was, unlikely, to, win, the, presidency, he, supported, general, zachary, taylor, for, the, whig, nomination, in, the, 1848, presidential, election, taylor, won, and, lincoln, hoped, in, vain, to, be, appointed, commissioner, of, the, united, states, general, land, office, the, administration, offered, to, appoint, him, secretary, or, governor, of, the, oregon, territory, as, consolation, this, distant, territory, was, a, democratic, stronghold, and, acceptance, of, the, post, would, have, disrupted, his, legal, and, political, career, in, illinois, so, he, declined, and, resumed, his, law, practice, in, his, springfield, practice, lincoln, handled, every, kind, of, business, that, could, come, before, a, prairie, lawyer, twice, a, year, he, appeared, for, 10, consecutive, weeks, in, county, seats, in, the, midstate, county, courts, this, continued, for, 16, years, lincoln, handled, transportation, cases, in, the, midst, of, the, nation, s, western, expansion, particularly, river, barge, conflicts, under, the, many, new, railroad, bridges, as, a, riverboat, man, lincoln, initially, favored, those, interests, but, ultimately, represented, whoever, hired, him, he, later, represented, a, bridge, company, against, a, riverboat, company, in, hurd, v, rock, island, bridge, company, a, landmark, case, involving, a, canal, boat, that, sank, after, hitting, a, bridge, in, 1849, he, received, a, patent, for, a, flotation, device, for, the, movement, of, boats, in, shallow, water, the, idea, was, never, commercialized, but, it, made, lincoln, the, only, president, to, hold, a, patent, lincoln, appeared, before, the, illinois, supreme, court, in, 175, cases, he, was, sole, counsel, in, 51, cases, of, which, 31, were, decided, in, his, favor, from, 1853, to, 1860, one, of, his, largest, clients, was, the, illinois, central, railroad, his, legal, reputation, gave, rise, to, the, nickname, honest, abe, in, an, 1858, criminal, trial, lincoln, represented, william, duff, armstrong, who, was, on, trial, for, the, murder, of, james, preston, metzker, the, case, is, famous, for, lincoln, s, use, of, a, fact, established, by, judicial, notice, to, challenge, the, credibility, of, an, eyewitness, after, an, opposing, witness, testified, to, seeing, the, crime, in, the, moonlight, lincoln, produced, a, farmers, almanac, showing, the, moon, was, at, a, low, angle, drastically, reducing, visibility, armstrong, was, acquitted, in, an, 1859, murder, case, leading, up, to, his, presidential, campaign, lincoln, elevated, his, profile, with, his, defense, of, simeon, quinn, peachy, harrison, who, was, a, third, cousin, harrison, was, also, the, grandson, of, lincoln, s, political, opponent, rev, peter, cartwright, harrison, was, charged, with, the, murder, of, greek, crafton, who, as, he, lay, dying, of, his, wounds, confessed, to, cartwright, that, he, had, provoked, harrison, lincoln, angrily, protested, the, judge, s, initial, decision, to, exclude, cartwright, s, testimony, about, the, confession, as, inadmissible, hearsay, lincoln, argued, that, the, testimony, involved, a, dying, declaration, and, was, not, subject, to, the, hearsay, rule, instead, of, holding, lincoln, in, contempt, of, court, as, expected, the, judge, a, democrat, reversed, his, ruling, and, admitted, the, testimony, into, evidence, resulting, in, harrison, s, acquittal, the, debate, over, the, status, of, slavery, in, the, territories, failed, to, alleviate, tensions, between, the, slave, holding, south, and, the, free, north, with, the, failure, of, the, compromise, of, 1850, a, legislative, package, designed, to, address, the, issue, in, his, 1852, eulogy, for, clay, lincoln, highlighted, the, latter, s, support, for, gradual, emancipation, and, opposition, to, both, extremes, on, the, slavery, issue, as, the, slavery, debate, in, the, nebraska, and, kansas, territories, became, particularly, acrimonious, illinois, senator, stephen, a, douglas, proposed, popular, sovereignty, as, a, compromise, the, measure, would, allow, the, electorate, of, each, territory, to, decide, the, status, of, slavery, the, legislation, alarmed, many, northerners, who, sought, to, prevent, the, spread, of, slavery, that, could, result, but, douglas, s, kansas, nebraska, act, narrowly, passed, congress, in, may, 1854, lincoln, did, not, comment, on, the, act, until, months, later, in, his, peoria, speech, of, october, 1854, lincoln, then, declared, his, opposition, to, slavery, which, he, repeated, en, route, to, the, presidency, he, said, the, kansas, act, had, a, declared, indifference, but, as, i, must, think, a, covert, real, zeal, for, the, spread, of, slavery, i, cannot, but, hate, it, i, hate, it, because, of, the, monstrous, injustice, of, slavery, itself, i, hate, it, because, it, deprives, our, republican, example, of, its, just, influence, in, the, world, lincoln, s, attacks, on, the, kansas, nebraska, act, marked, his, return, to, political, life, nationally, the, whigs, were, irreparably, split, by, the, kansas, nebraska, act, and, other, efforts, to, compromise, on, the, slavery, issue, reflecting, on, the, demise, of, his, party, lincoln, wrote, in, 1855, i, think, i, am, a, whig, but, others, say, there, are, no, whigs, and, that, i, am, an, abolitionist, i, do, no, more, than, oppose, the, extension, of, slavery, the, new, republican, party, was, formed, as, a, northern, party, dedicated, to, antislavery, drawing, from, the, antislavery, wing, of, the, whig, party, and, combining, free, soil, liberty, and, antislavery, democratic, party, members, lincoln, resisted, early, republican, entreaties, fearing, that, the, new, party, would, become, a, platform, for, extreme, abolitionists, lincoln, held, out, hope, for, rejuvenating, the, whigs, though, he, lamented, his, party, s, growing, closeness, with, the, nativist, know, nothing, movement, in, 1854, lincoln, was, elected, to, the, illinois, legislature, but, before, the, term, began, in, january, he, declined, to, take, his, seat, so, that, he, would, be, eligible, to, be, a, candidate, in, the, upcoming, u, s, senate, election, the, year, s, elections, showed, the, strong, opposition, to, the, kansas, nebraska, act, and, in, the, aftermath, lincoln, sought, election, to, the, u, s, senate, at, that, time, senators, were, elected, by, state, legislatures, after, leading, in, the, first, six, rounds, of, voting, he, was, unable, to, obtain, a, majority, lincoln, instructed, his, backers, to, vote, for, lyman, trumbull, trumbull, was, an, antislavery, democrat, and, had, received, few, votes, in, the, earlier, ballots, his, supporters, also, antislavery, democrats, had, vowed, not, to, support, any, whig, lincoln, s, decision, to, withdraw, enabled, his, whig, supporters, and, trumbull, s, antislavery, democrats, to, combine, and, defeat, the, mainstream, democratic, candidate, joel, aldrich, matteson, violent, political, confrontations, in, kansas, continued, and, opposition, to, the, kansas, nebraska, act, remained, strong, throughout, the, north, as, the, 1856, elections, approached, lincoln, joined, the, republicans, and, attended, the, bloomington, convention, which, formally, established, the, illinois, republican, party, the, convention, platform, endorsed, congress, s, right, to, regulate, slavery, in, the, territories, and, backed, the, admission, of, kansas, as, a, free, state, lincoln, gave, the, final, speech, of, the, convention, supporting, the, party, platform, and, called, for, the, preservation, of, the, union, at, the, june, 1856, republican, national, convention, though, lincoln, received, support, to, run, as, vice, president, john, c, fr, mont, and, william, dayton, were, on, the, ticket, which, lincoln, supported, throughout, illinois, the, democrats, nominated, former, secretary, of, state, james, buchanan, and, the, know, nothings, nominated, former, whig, president, millard, fillmore, buchanan, prevailed, while, republican, william, henry, bissell, won, election, as, governor, of, illinois, and, lincoln, became, a, leading, republican, in, illinois, dred, scott, was, a, slave, whose, master, took, him, from, a, slave, state, to, a, territory, that, was, free, as, a, result, of, the, missouri, compromise, after, scott, was, returned, to, the, slave, state, he, petitioned, a, federal, court, for, his, freedom, his, petition, was, denied, in, dred, scott, v, sandford, 1857, in, his, opinion, supreme, court, chief, justice, roger, b, taney, wrote, that, black, people, were, not, citizens, and, derived, no, rights, from, the, constitution, and, that, the, missouri, compromise, was, unconstitutional, for, infringing, upon, slave, owners, property, rights, while, many, democrats, hoped, that, dred, scott, would, end, the, dispute, over, slavery, in, the, territories, the, decision, sparked, further, outrage, in, the, north, lincoln, denounced, it, as, the, product, of, a, conspiracy, of, democrats, to, support, the, slave, power, he, argued, the, decision, was, at, variance, with, the, declaration, of, independence, he, said, that, while, the, founding, fathers, did, not, believe, all, men, equal, in, every, respect, they, believed, all, men, were, equal, in, certain, inalienable, rights, among, which, are, life, liberty, and, the, pursuit, of, happiness, in, 1858, douglas, was, up, for, re, election, in, the, u, s, senate, and, lincoln, hoped, to, defeat, him, many, in, the, party, felt, that, a, former, whig, should, be, nominated, in, 1858, and, lincoln, s, 1856, campaigning, and, support, of, trumbull, had, earned, him, a, favor, some, eastern, republicans, supported, douglas, for, his, opposition, to, the, lecompton, constitution, and, admission, of, kansas, as, a, slave, state, many, illinois, republicans, resented, this, eastern, interference, for, the, first, time, illinois, republicans, held, a, convention, to, agree, upon, a, senate, candidate, and, lincoln, won, the, nomination, with, little, opposition, lincoln, accepted, the, nomination, with, great, enthusiasm, and, zeal, after, his, nomination, he, delivered, his, house, divided, speech, with, the, biblical, reference, mark, 3, 25, a, house, divided, against, itself, cannot, stand, i, believe, this, government, cannot, endure, permanently, half, slave, and, half, free, i, do, not, expect, the, union, to, be, dissolved, i, do, not, expect, the, house, to, fall, but, i, do, expect, it, will, cease, to, be, divided, it, will, become, all, one, thing, or, all, the, other, the, speech, created, a, stark, image, of, the, danger, of, disunion, the, stage, was, then, set, for, the, election, of, the, illinois, legislature, which, would, in, turn, select, lincoln, or, douglas, when, informed, of, lincoln, s, nomination, douglas, stated, is, the, strong, man, of, the, party, and, if, i, beat, him, my, victory, will, be, hardly, won, the, senate, campaign, featured, seven, debates, between, lincoln, and, douglas, these, were, the, most, famous, political, debates, in, american, history, they, had, an, atmosphere, akin, to, a, prizefight, and, drew, crowds, in, the, thousands, the, principals, stood, in, stark, contrast, both, physically, and, politically, lincoln, warned, that, the, slave, power, was, threatening, the, values, of, republicanism, and, he, accused, douglas, of, distorting, the, founding, fathers, premise, that, all, men, are, created, equal, in, his, freeport, doctrine, douglas, argued, that, despite, the, dred, scott, decision, which, he, claimed, to, support, local, settlers, under, the, doctrine, of, popular, sovereignty, should, be, free, to, choose, whether, to, allow, slavery, within, their, territory, and, he, accused, lincoln, of, having, joined, the, abolitionists, lincoln, s, argument, assumed, a, moral, tone, as, he, claimed, that, douglas, represented, a, conspiracy, to, promote, slavery, douglas, s, argument, was, more, legal, in, nature, claiming, that, lincoln, was, defying, the, authority, of, the, u, s, supreme, court, as, exercised, in, the, dred, scott, decision, though, the, republican, legislative, candidates, won, more, popular, votes, the, democrats, won, more, seats, and, the, legislature, re, elected, douglas, however, lincoln, s, articulation, of, the, issues, had, given, him, a, national, political, presence, in, may, 1859, lincoln, purchased, the, illinois, staats, anzeiger, a, german, language, newspaper, that, was, consistently, supportive, most, of, the, state, s, 130, 000, german, americans, voted, for, democrats, but, the, german, language, paper, mobilized, republican, support, in, the, aftermath, of, the, 1858, election, newspapers, frequently, mentioned, lincoln, as, a, potential, republican, presidential, candidate, rivaled, by, william, h, seward, salmon, p, chase, edward, bates, and, simon, cameron, while, lincoln, was, popular, in, the, midwest, he, lacked, support, in, the, northeast, and, was, unsure, whether, to, seek, the, office, in, january, 1860, lincoln, told, a, group, of, political, allies, that, he, would, accept, the, presidential, nomination, if, offered, and, in, the, following, months, several, local, papers, endorsed, his, candidacy, over, the, coming, months, lincoln, was, tireless, making, nearly, fifty, speeches, along, the, campaign, trail, by, the, quality, and, simplicity, of, his, rhetoric, he, quickly, became, the, champion, of, the, republican, party, however, despite, his, overwhelming, support, in, the, midwestern, united, states, he, was, less, appreciated, in, the, east, horace, greeley, editor, of, the, new, york, tribune, at, that, time, wrote, up, an, unflattering, account, of, lincoln, s, compromising, position, on, slavery, and, his, reluctance, to, challenge, the, court, s, dred, scott, ruling, which, was, promptly, used, against, him, by, his, political, rivals, on, february, 27, 1860, powerful, new, york, republicans, invited, lincoln, to, give, a, speech, at, cooper, union, in, which, he, argued, that, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, had, little, use, for, popular, sovereignty, and, had, repeatedly, sought, to, restrict, slavery, he, insisted, that, morality, required, opposition, to, slavery, and, rejected, any, groping, for, some, middle, ground, between, the, right, and, the, wrong, many, in, the, audience, thought, he, appeared, awkward, and, even, ugly, but, lincoln, demonstrated, intellectual, leadership, which, brought, him, into, contention, journalist, noah, brooks, reported, no, man, ever, before, made, such, an, impression, on, his, first, appeal, to, a, new, york, audience, historian, david, herbert, donald, described, the, speech, as, a, superb, political, move, for, an, unannounced, presidential, aspirant, appearing, in, seward, s, home, state, sponsored, by, a, group, largely, loyal, to, chase, lincoln, shrewdly, made, no, reference, to, either, of, these, republican, rivals, for, the, nomination, in, response, to, an, inquiry, about, his, ambitions, lincoln, said, the, taste, is, in, my, mouth, a, little, on, may, 9, 10, 1860, the, illinois, republican, state, convention, was, held, in, decatur, lincoln, s, followers, organized, a, campaign, team, led, by, david, davis, norman, judd, leonard, swett, and, jesse, dubois, and, lincoln, received, his, first, endorsement, exploiting, his, embellished, frontier, legend, clearing, land, and, splitting, fence, rails, lincoln, s, supporters, adopted, the, label, of, the, rail, candidate, in, 1860, lincoln, described, himself, i, am, in, height, six, feet, four, inches, nearly, lean, in, flesh, weighing, on, an, average, one, hundred, and, eighty, pounds, dark, complexion, with, coarse, black, hair, and, gray, eyes, michael, martinez, wrote, about, the, effective, imaging, of, lincoln, by, his, campaign, at, times, he, was, presented, as, the, plain, talking, rail, splitter, and, at, other, times, he, was, honest, abe, unpolished, but, trustworthy, on, may, 18, at, the, republican, national, convention, in, chicago, lincoln, won, the, nomination, on, the, third, ballot, beating, candidates, such, as, seward, and, chase, a, former, democrat, hannibal, hamlin, of, maine, was, nominated, for, vice, president, to, balance, the, ticket, lincoln, s, success, depended, on, his, campaign, team, his, reputation, as, a, moderate, on, the, slavery, issue, and, his, strong, support, for, internal, improvements, and, the, tariff, pennsylvania, put, him, over, the, top, led, by, the, state, s, iron, interests, who, were, reassured, by, his, tariff, support, lincoln, s, managers, had, focused, on, this, delegation, while, honoring, lincoln, s, dictate, to, make, no, contracts, that, will, bind, me, as, the, slave, power, tightened, its, grip, on, the, national, government, most, republicans, agreed, with, lincoln, that, the, north, was, the, aggrieved, party, throughout, the, 1850s, lincoln, had, doubted, the, prospects, of, civil, war, and, his, supporters, rejected, claims, that, his, election, would, incite, secession, when, douglas, was, selected, as, the, candidate, of, the, northern, democrats, delegates, from, eleven, slave, states, walked, out, of, the, democratic, convention, they, opposed, douglas, s, position, on, popular, sovereignty, and, selected, incumbent, vice, president, john, c, breckinridge, as, their, candidate, a, group, of, former, whigs, and, know, nothings, formed, the, constitutional, union, party, and, nominated, john, bell, of, tennessee, lincoln, and, douglas, competed, for, votes, in, the, north, while, bell, and, breckinridge, primarily, found, support, in, the, south, before, the, republican, convention, the, lincoln, campaign, began, cultivating, a, nationwide, youth, organization, the, wide, awakes, which, it, used, to, generate, popular, support, throughout, the, country, to, spearhead, voter, registration, drives, thinking, that, new, voters, and, young, voters, tended, to, embrace, new, parties, people, of, the, northern, states, knew, the, southern, states, would, vote, against, lincoln, and, rallied, supporters, for, lincoln, as, douglas, and, the, other, candidates, campaigned, lincoln, gave, no, speeches, relying, on, the, enthusiasm, of, the, republican, party, the, party, did, the, leg, work, that, produced, majorities, across, the, north, and, produced, an, abundance, of, campaign, posters, leaflets, and, newspaper, editorials, republican, speakers, focused, first, on, the, party, platform, and, second, on, lincoln, s, life, story, emphasizing, his, childhood, poverty, the, goal, was, to, demonstrate, the, power, of, free, labor, which, allowed, a, common, farm, boy, to, work, his, way, to, the, top, by, his, own, efforts, the, republican, party, s, production, of, campaign, literature, dwarfed, the, combined, opposition, a, chicago, tribune, writer, produced, a, pamphlet, that, detailed, lincoln, s, life, and, sold, 100, 000, 200, 000, copies, though, he, did, not, give, public, appearances, many, sought, to, visit, him, and, write, him, in, the, runup, to, the, election, he, took, an, office, in, the, illinois, state, capitol, to, deal, with, the, influx, of, attention, he, also, hired, john, george, nicolay, as, his, personal, secretary, who, would, remain, in, that, role, during, the, presidency, on, november, 6, 1860, lincoln, was, elected, the, 16th, president, he, was, the, first, republican, president, and, his, victory, was, entirely, due, to, his, support, in, the, north, and, west, no, ballots, were, cast, for, him, in, 10, of, the, 15, southern, slave, states, and, he, won, only, two, of, 996, counties, in, all, the, southern, states, an, omen, of, the, impending, civil, war, lincoln, received, 1, 866, 452, votes, or, 39, 8, of, the, total, in, a, four, way, race, carrying, the, free, northern, states, as, well, as, california, and, oregon, his, victory, in, the, electoral, college, was, decisive, lincoln, had, 180, votes, to, 123, for, his, opponents, the, south, was, outraged, by, lincoln, s, election, and, in, response, secessionists, implemented, plans, to, leave, the, union, before, he, took, office, in, march, 1861, on, december, 20, 1860, south, carolina, took, the, lead, by, adopting, an, ordinance, of, secession, by, february, 1, 1861, florida, mississippi, alabama, georgia, louisiana, and, texas, followed, six, of, these, states, declared, themselves, to, be, a, sovereign, nation, the, confederate, states, of, america, and, adopted, a, constitution, the, upper, south, and, border, states, delaware, maryland, virginia, north, carolina, tennessee, kentucky, missouri, and, arkansas, initially, rejected, the, secessionist, appeal, president, buchanan, and, president, elect, lincoln, refused, to, recognize, the, confederacy, declaring, secession, illegal, the, confederacy, selected, jefferson, davis, as, its, provisional, president, on, february, 9, 1861, attempts, at, compromise, followed, but, lincoln, and, the, republicans, rejected, the, proposed, crittenden, compromise, as, contrary, to, the, party, s, platform, of, free, soil, in, the, territories, lincoln, said, i, will, suffer, death, before, i, consent, to, any, concession, or, compromise, which, looks, like, buying, the, privilege, to, take, possession, of, this, government, to, which, we, have, a, constitutional, right, lincoln, supported, the, corwin, amendment, to, the, constitution, which, passed, congress, and, was, awaiting, ratification, by, the, states, when, lincoln, took, office, that, doomed, amendment, would, have, protected, slavery, in, states, where, it, already, existed, on, march, 4, 1861, in, his, first, inaugural, address, lincoln, said, that, because, he, holds, such, a, provision, to, now, be, implied, constitutional, law, i, have, no, objection, to, its, being, made, express, and, irrevocable, a, few, weeks, before, the, war, lincoln, sent, a, letter, to, every, governor, informing, them, congress, had, passed, a, joint, resolution, to, amend, the, constitution, on, february, 11, 1861, lincoln, gave, a, particularly, emotional, farewell, address, upon, leaving, springfield, he, would, never, again, return, to, springfield, alive, lincoln, traveled, east, in, a, special, train, due, to, secessionist, plots, a, then, unprecedented, attention, to, security, was, given, to, him, and, his, train, en, route, to, his, inauguration, lincoln, addressed, crowds, and, legislatures, across, the, north, the, president, elect, evaded, suspected, assassins, in, baltimore, he, traveled, in, disguise, wearing, a, soft, felt, hat, instead, of, his, customary, stovepipe, hat, and, draping, an, overcoat, over, his, shoulders, while, hunching, slightly, to, conceal, his, height, his, friend, congressman, elihu, b, washburne, recognized, him, on, the, platform, upon, arrival, and, loudly, called, out, to, him, on, february, 23, 1861, he, arrived, in, washington, d, c, which, was, placed, under, substantial, military, guard, lincoln, directed, his, inaugural, address, to, the, south, proclaiming, once, again, that, he, had, no, inclination, to, abolish, slavery, in, the, southern, states, apprehension, seems, to, exist, among, the, people, of, the, southern, states, that, by, the, accession, of, a, republican, administration, their, property, and, their, peace, and, personal, security, are, to, be, endangered, there, has, never, been, any, reasonable, cause, for, such, apprehension, indeed, the, most, ample, evidence, to, the, contrary, has, all, the, while, existed, and, been, open, to, their, inspection, it, is, found, in, nearly, all, the, published, speeches, of, him, who, now, addresses, you, i, do, but, quote, from, one, of, those, speeches, when, i, declare, that, i, have, no, purpose, directly, or, indirectly, to, interfere, with, the, institution, of, slavery, in, the, states, where, it, exists, i, believe, i, have, no, lawful, right, to, do, so, and, i, have, no, inclination, to, do, so, lincoln, cited, his, plans, for, banning, the, expansion, of, slavery, as, the, key, source, of, conflict, between, north, and, south, stating, one, section, of, our, country, believes, slavery, is, right, and, ought, to, be, extended, while, the, other, believes, it, is, wrong, and, ought, not, to, be, extended, this, is, the, only, substantial, dispute, the, president, ended, his, address, with, an, appeal, to, the, people, of, the, south, we, are, not, enemies, but, friends, we, must, not, be, enemies, the, mystic, chords, of, memory, stretching, from, every, battlefield, and, patriot, grave, to, every, living, heart, and, hearthstone, all, over, this, broad, land, will, yet, swell, the, chorus, of, the, union, when, again, touched, as, surely, they, will, be, by, the, better, angels, of, our, nature, the, failure, of, the, peace, conference, of, 1861, signaled, that, legislative, compromise, was, impossible, by, march, 1861, no, leaders, of, the, insurrection, had, proposed, rejoining, the, union, on, any, terms, meanwhile, lincoln, and, the, republican, leadership, agreed, that, the, dismantling, of, the, union, could, not, be, tolerated, in, his, second, inaugural, address, lincoln, looked, back, on, the, situation, at, the, time, and, said, both, parties, deprecated, war, but, one, of, them, would, make, war, rather, than, let, the, nation, survive, and, the, other, would, accept, war, rather, than, let, it, perish, and, the, war, came, major, robert, anderson, commander, of, the, union, s, fort, sumter, in, charleston, south, carolina, sent, a, request, for, provisions, to, washington, and, lincoln, s, order, to, meet, that, request, was, seen, by, the, secessionists, as, an, act, of, war, on, april, 12, 1861, confederate, forces, fired, on, union, troops, at, fort, sumter, and, began, the, fight, historian, allan, nevins, argued, that, the, newly, inaugurated, lincoln, made, three, miscalculations, underestimating, the, gravity, of, the, crisis, exaggerating, the, strength, of, unionist, sentiment, in, the, south, and, overlooking, southern, unionist, opposition, to, an, invasion, william, tecumseh, sherman, talked, to, lincoln, during, inauguration, week, and, was, sadly, disappointed, at, his, failure, to, realize, that, the, country, was, sleeping, on, a, volcano, and, that, the, south, was, preparing, for, war, donald, concludes, his, repeated, efforts, to, avoid, collision, in, the, months, between, inauguration, and, the, firing, on, fort, sumter, showed, he, adhered, to, his, vow, not, to, be, the, first, to, shed, fraternal, blood, but, he, had, also, vowed, not, to, surrender, the, forts, the, only, resolution, of, these, contradictory, positions, was, for, the, confederates, to, fire, the, first, shot, they, did, just, that, on, april, 15, lincoln, called, on, the, states, to, send, a, total, of, 75, 000, volunteer, troops, to, recapture, forts, protect, washington, and, preserve, the, union, which, in, his, view, remained, intact, despite, the, seceding, states, this, call, forced, states, to, choose, sides, virginia, seceded, and, was, rewarded, with, the, designation, of, richmond, as, the, confederate, capital, despite, its, exposure, to, union, lines, north, carolina, tennessee, and, arkansas, followed, over, the, following, two, months, secession, sentiment, was, strong, in, missouri, and, maryland, but, did, not, prevail, kentucky, remained, neutral, the, fort, sumter, attack, rallied, americans, north, of, the, mason, dixon, line, to, defend, the, nation, as, states, sent, union, regiments, south, on, april, 19, baltimore, mobs, in, control, of, the, rail, links, attacked, union, troops, who, were, changing, trains, local, leaders, groups, later, burned, critical, rail, bridges, to, the, capital, and, the, army, responded, by, arresting, local, maryland, officials, lincoln, suspended, the, writ, of, habeas, corpus, in, an, effort, to, protect, the, troops, trying, to, reach, washington, john, merryman, one, maryland, official, hindering, the, u, s, troop, movements, petitioned, supreme, court, chief, justice, roger, b, taney, to, issue, a, writ, of, habeas, corpus, in, june, in, ex, parte, merryman, taney, not, ruling, on, behalf, of, the, supreme, court, issued, the, writ, believing, that, article, i, section, 9, of, the, constitution, authorized, only, congress, and, not, the, president, to, suspend, it, but, lincoln, invoked, nonacquiescence, and, persisted, with, the, policy, of, suspension, in, select, areas, lincoln, took, executive, control, of, the, war, and, shaped, the, union, military, strategy, he, responded, to, the, unprecedented, political, and, military, crisis, as, commander, in, chief, by, exercising, unprecedented, authority, he, expanded, his, war, powers, imposed, a, blockade, on, confederate, ports, disbursed, funds, before, appropriation, by, congress, suspended, habeas, corpus, and, arrested, and, imprisoned, thousands, of, suspected, confederate, sympathizers, lincoln, gained, the, support, of, congress, and, the, northern, public, for, these, actions, lincoln, also, had, to, reinforce, union, sympathies, in, the, border, slave, states, and, keep, the, war, from, becoming, an, international, conflict, it, was, clear, from, the, outset, that, bipartisan, support, was, essential, to, success, and, that, any, compromise, alienated, factions, on, both, sides, of, the, aisle, such, as, the, appointment, of, republicans, and, democrats, to, command, positions, copperheads, criticized, lincoln, for, refusing, to, compromise, on, slavery, the, radical, republicans, criticized, him, for, moving, too, slowly, in, abolishing, slavery, on, august, 6, 1861, lincoln, signed, the, confiscation, act, of, 1861, which, authorized, judicial, proceedings, to, confiscate, and, free, slaves, who, were, used, to, support, the, confederates, the, law, had, little, practical, effect, but, it, signaled, political, support, for, abolishing, slavery, in, august, 1861, general, john, c, fr, mont, the, 1856, republican, presidential, nominee, without, consulting, washington, issued, a, martial, edict, freeing, slaves, of, the, rebels, lincoln, canceled, the, proclamation, as, violating, the, confiscation, act, of, 1861, and, beyond, fr, mont, s, authority, to, issue, as, a, result, union, enlistments, from, maryland, kentucky, and, missouri, increased, by, over, 40, 000, internationally, lincoln, wanted, to, forestall, foreign, military, aid, to, the, confederacy, he, relied,

clear, perception, that, a, point, could, be, clinched, for, america, s, true, position, at, the, same, time, that, full, satisfaction, was, given, to, a, friendly, country, lincoln, painstakingly, monitored, the, telegraph, reports, coming, into, the, war, department, he, tracked, all, phases, of, the, effort, consulting, with, governors, and, selecting, generals, based, on, their, success, their, state, and, their, party, in, january, 1862, after, complaints, of, inefficiency, and, profiteering, in, the, war, department, lincoln, replaced, war, secretary, simon, cameron, with, edwin, stanton, stanton, centralized, the, war, department, s, activities, auditing, and, canceling, contracts, saving, the, federal, government, 17, 000, 000, stanton, was, a, staunch, unionist, pro, business, conservative, democrat, who, gravitated, toward, the, radical, republican, faction, he, worked, more, often, and, more, closely, with, lincoln, than, did, any, other, senior, official, stanton, and, lincoln, virtually, conducted, the, war, together, say, thomas, and, hyman, lincoln, s, war, strategy, had, two, priorities, ensuring, that, washington, was, well, defended, and, conducting, an, aggressive, war, effort, for, a, prompt, decisive, victory, twice, a, week, lincoln, met, with, his, cabinet, in, the, afternoon, occasionally, mary, prevailed, on, him, to, take, a, carriage, ride, concerned, that, he, was, working, too, hard, for, his, edification, lincoln, relied, upon, a, book, by, his, chief, of, staff, general, henry, halleck, entitled, elements, of, military, art, and, science, halleck, was, a, disciple, of, the, european, strategist, antoine, henri, jomini, lincoln, began, to, appreciate, the, critical, need, to, control, strategic, points, such, as, the, mississippi, river, lincoln, saw, the, importance, of, vicksburg, and, understood, the, necessity, of, defeating, the, enemy, s, army, rather, than, merely, capturing, territory, in, directing, the, union, s, war, strategy, lincoln, valued, the, advice, of, gen, winfield, scott, even, after, his, retirement, as, commanding, general, of, the, united, states, army, on, june, 23, 24, 1862, lincoln, made, an, unannounced, visit, to, west, point, where, he, spent, five, hours, consulting, with, scott, regarding, the, handling, of, the, civil, war, and, the, staffing, of, the, war, department, after, the, union, rout, at, bull, run, and, winfield, scott, s, retirement, lincoln, appointed, major, general, george, b, mcclellan, general, in, chief, mcclellan, then, took, months, to, plan, his, virginia, peninsula, campaign, mcclellan, s, slow, progress, frustrated, lincoln, as, did, his, position, that, no, troops, were, needed, to, defend, washington, mcclellan, in, turn, blamed, the, failure, of, the, campaign, on, lincoln, s, reservation, of, troops, for, the, capital, in, 1862, lincoln, removed, mcclellan, for, the, general, s, continued, inaction, he, elevated, henry, halleck, in, july, and, appointed, john, pope, as, head, of, the, new, army, of, virginia, pope, satisfied, lincoln, s, desire, to, advance, on, richmond, from, the, north, thereby, protecting, washington, from, counterattack, but, in, the, summer, of, 1862, pope, was, soundly, defeated, at, the, second, battle, of, bull, run, forcing, the, army, of, the, potomac, back, to, defend, washington, despite, his, dissatisfaction, with, mcclellan, s, failure, to, reinforce, pope, lincoln, restored, him, to, command, of, all, forces, around, washington, two, days, after, mcclellan, s, return, to, command, general, robert, e, lee, s, forces, crossed, the, potomac, river, into, maryland, leading, to, the, battle, of, antietam, that, battle, a, union, victory, was, among, the, bloodiest, in, american, history, it, facilitated, lincoln, s, emancipation, proclamation, in, january, mcclellan, then, resisted, the, president, s, demand, that, he, pursue, lee, s, withdrawing, army, while, general, don, carlos, buell, likewise, refused, orders, to, move, the, army, of, the, ohio, against, rebel, forces, in, eastern, tennessee, lincoln, replaced, buell, with, william, rosecrans, and, after, the, 1862, midterm, elections, he, replaced, mcclellan, with, ambrose, burnside, the, appointments, were, both, politically, neutral, and, adroit, on, lincoln, s, part, against, presidential, advice, burnside, launched, an, offensive, across, the, rappahannock, river, and, was, defeated, by, lee, at, fredericksburg, in, december, desertions, during, 1863, came, in, the, thousands, and, only, increased, after, fredericksburg, so, lincoln, replaced, burnside, with, joseph, hooker, in, the, 1862, midterm, elections, the, republicans, suffered, severe, losses, due, to, rising, inflation, high, taxes, rumors, of, corruption, suspension, of, habeas, corpus, military, draft, law, and, fears, that, freed, slaves, would, come, north, and, undermine, the, labor, market, the, emancipation, proclamation, gained, votes, for, republicans, in, rural, new, england, and, the, upper, midwest, but, cost, votes, in, the, irish, and, german, strongholds, and, in, the, lower, midwest, where, many, southerners, had, lived, for, generations, in, the, spring, of, 1863, lincoln, was, sufficiently, optimistic, about, upcoming, military, campaigns, to, think, the, end, of, the, war, could, be, near, the, plans, included, attacks, by, hooker, on, lee, north, of, richmond, rosecrans, on, chattanooga, grant, on, vicksburg, and, a, naval, assault, on, charleston, hooker, was, routed, by, lee, at, the, battle, of, chancellorsville, in, may, then, resigned, and, was, replaced, by, george, meade, meade, followed, lee, north, into, pennsylvania, and, beat, him, in, the, gettysburg, campaign, but, then, failed, to, follow, up, despite, lincoln, s, demands, at, the, same, time, grant, captured, vicksburg, and, gained, control, of, the, mississippi, river, splitting, the, far, western, rebel, states, the, federal, government, s, power, to, end, slavery, was, limited, by, the, constitution, which, before, 1865, was, understood, to, reserve, the, issue, to, the, individual, states, lincoln, believed, that, slavery, would, be, rendered, obsolete, if, its, expansion, into, new, territories, were, prevented, because, these, territories, would, be, admitted, to, the, union, as, free, states, and, free, states, would, come, to, outnumber, slave, states, he, sought, to, persuade, the, states, to, agree, to, compensation, for, emancipating, their, slaves, lincoln, rejected, major, general, john, c, fr, mont, s, august, 1861, emancipation, attempt, as, well, as, one, by, major, general, david, hunter, in, may, 1862, on, the, grounds, that, it, was, not, within, their, power, and, might, upset, loyal, border, states, enough, for, them, to, secede, in, june, 1862, congress, passed, an, act, banning, slavery, on, all, federal, territory, which, lincoln, signed, in, july, the, confiscation, act, of, 1862, was, enacted, providing, court, procedures, to, free, the, slaves, of, those, convicted, of, aiding, the, rebellion, lincoln, approved, the, bill, despite, his, belief, that, it, was, unconstitutional, he, felt, such, action, could, be, taken, only, within, the, war, powers, of, the, commander, in, chief, which, he, planned, to, exercise, on, july, 22, 1862, lincoln, reviewed, a, draft, of, the, emancipation, proclamation, with, his, cabinet, peace, democrats, copperheads, argued, that, emancipation, was, a, stumbling, block, to, peace, and, reunification, but, republican, editor, horace, greeley, of, the, new, york, tribune, in, his, public, letter, the, prayer, of, twenty, millions, implored, lincoln, to, embrace, emancipation, in, a, public, letter, of, august, 22, 1862, lincoln, replied, to, greeley, writing, that, while, he, personally, wished, all, men, could, be, free, his, first, obligation, as, president, was, to, preserve, the, union, my, paramount, object, in, this, struggle, is, to, save, the, union, and, is, not, either, to, save, or, to, destroy, slavery, if, i, could, save, the, union, without, freeing, any, slave, i, would, do, it, and, if, i, could, save, it, by, freeing, all, the, slaves, i, would, do, it, and, if, i, could, save, it, by, freeing, some, and, leaving, others, alone, i, would, also, do, that, what, i, do, about, slavery, and, the, colored, race, i, do, because, i, believe, it, helps, to, save, the, union, and, what, i, forbear, i, forbear, because, i, do, not, believe, it, would, help, to, save, the, union, i, have, here, stated, my, purpose, according, to, my, view, of, official, duty, and, i, intend, no, modification, of, my, oft, expressed, personal, wish, that, all, men, everywhere, could, be, free, when, lincoln, published, his, reply, to, greeley, he, had, already, decided, to, issue, the, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, and, therefore, had, already, chosen, the, third, option, he, mentioned, in, his, letter, to, greeley, to, free, some, of, the, slaves, namely, those, in, the, states, in, rebellion, some, scholars, therefore, believe, that, his, reply, to, greeley, was, disingenuous, and, was, intended, to, reassure, white, people, who, would, have, opposed, a, war, for, emancipation, that, emancipation, was, merely, a, means, to, preserve, the, union, on, september, 22, 1862, lincoln, issued, the, preliminary, emancipation, proclamation, which, announced, that, in, states, still, in, rebellion, on, january, 1, 1863, the, slaves, would, be, freed, he, spent, the, next, 100, days, between, september, 22, and, january, 1, preparing, the, army, and, the, nation, for, emancipation, while, democrats, rallied, their, voters, by, warning, of, the, threat, that, freed, slaves, posed, to, northern, whites, at, the, same, time, during, those, 100, days, lincoln, made, efforts, to, end, the, war, with, slavery, intact, suggesting, that, he, still, took, seriously, the, first, option, he, mentioned, in, his, letter, to, greeley, saving, the, union, without, freeing, any, slave, but, on, january, 1, 1863, keeping, his, word, lincoln, issued, the, emancipation, proclamation, freeing, the, slaves, in, 10, states, not, then, under, union, control, with, exemptions, specified, for, areas, under, such, control, lincoln, s, comment, on, signing, the, proclamation, was, i, never, in, my, life, felt, more, certain, that, i, was, doing, right, than, i, do, in, signing, this, paper, with, the, abolition, of, slavery, in, the, rebel, states, now, a, military, objective, union, armies, advancing, south, enable, thousands, of, slaves, to, escape, to, freedom, the, emancipation, proclamation, having, stated, that, freedmen, would, be, received, into, the, armed, service, of, the, united, states, enlisting, these, freedmen, became, official, policy, by, the, spring, of, 1863, lincoln, was, ready, to, recruit, black, troops, in, more, than, token, numbers, in, a, letter, to, tennessee, military, governor, andrew, johnson, encouraging, him, to, lead, the, way, in, raising, black, troops, lincoln, wrote, the, bare, sight, of, fifty, thousand, armed, and, drilled, black, soldiers, on, the, banks, of, the, mississippi, would, end, the, rebellion, at, once, by, the, end, of, 1863, at, lincoln, s, direction, general, lorenzo, thomas, had, enrolled, twenty, regiments, of, african, americans, from, the, mississippi, valley, lincoln, spoke, at, the, dedication, of, the, gettysburg, battlefield, cemetery, on, november, 19, 1863, in, 272, words, and, three, minutes, lincoln, asserted, that, the, nation, was, born, not, in, 1789, but, in, 1776, conceived, in, liberty, and, dedicated, to, the, proposition, that, all, men, are, created, equal, he, defined, the, war, as, dedicated, to, the, principles, of, liberty, and, equality, for, all, he, declared, that, the, deaths, of, so, many, brave, soldiers, would, not, be, in, vain, that, the, future, of, democracy, would, be, assured, and, that, government, of, the, people, by, the, people, for, the, people, shall, not, perish, from, the, earth, defying, his, prediction, that, the, world, will, little, note, nor, long, remember, what, we, say, here, the, address, became, the, most, quoted, speech, in, american, history, general, ulysses, grant, s, victories, at, the, battle, of, shiloh, and, in, the, vicksburg, campaign, impressed, lincoln, responding, to, criticism, of, grant, after, shiloh, lincoln, had, said, i, can, t, spare, this, man, he, fights, with, grant, in, command, lincoln, felt, the, union, army, could, advance, in, multiple, theaters, while, also, including, black, troops, meade, s, failure, to, capture, lee, s, army, after, gettysburg, and, the, continued, passivity, of, the, army, of, the, potomac, persuaded, lincoln, to, promote, grant, to, supreme, commander, grant, then, assumed, command, of, meade, s, army, lincoln, was, concerned, that, grant, might, be, considering, a, presidential, candidacy, in, 1864, he, arranged, for, an, intermediary, to, inquire, into, grant, s, political, intentions, and, once, assured, that, he, had, none, lincoln, promoted, grant, to, the, newly, revived, rank, of, lieutenant, general, a, rank, which, had, been, unoccupied, since, george, washington, authorization, for, such, a, promotion, with, the, advice, and, consent, of, the, senate, was, provided, by, a, new, bill, which, lincoln, signed, the, same, day, he, submitted, grant, s, name, to, the, senate, his, nomination, was, confirmed, by, the, senate, on, march, 2, 1864, grant, in, 1864, waged, the, bloody, overland, campaign, which, exacted, heavy, losses, on, both, sides, when, lincoln, asked, what, grant, s, plans, were, the, persistent, general, replied, i, propose, to, fight, it, out, on, this, line, if, it, takes, all, summer, grant, s, army, moved, steadily, south, lincoln, traveled, to, grant, s, headquarters, at, city, point, virginia, to, confer, with, grant, and, william, tecumseh, sherman, lincoln, reacted, to, union, losses, by, mobilizing, support, throughout, the, north, lincoln, authorized, grant, to, target, infrastructure, plantations, railroads, and, bridges, hoping, to, weaken, the, south, s, morale, and, fighting, ability, he, emphasized, defeat, of, the, confederate, armies, over, destruction, which, was, considerable, for, its, own, sake, lincoln, s, engagement, became, distinctly, personal, on, one, occasion, in, 1864, when, confederate, general, jubal, early, raided, washington, d, c, legend, has, it, that, while, lincoln, watched, from, an, exposed, position, union, captain, and, future, supreme, court, justice, oliver, wendell, holmes, jr, shouted, at, him, get, down, you, damn, fool, before, you, get, shot, but, this, story, is, commonly, regarded, as, apocryphal, as, grant, continued, to, weaken, lee, s, forces, efforts, to, discuss, peace, began, confederate, vice, president, stephens, led, a, group, meeting, with, lincoln, seward, and, others, at, hampton, roads, lincoln, refused, to, negotiate, with, the, confederacy, as, a, coequal, his, objective, to, end, the, fighting, was, not, realized, on, april, 1, 1865, grant, nearly, encircled, petersburg, in, a, siege, the, confederate, government, evacuated, richmond, and, lincoln, visited, the, conquered, capital, on, april, 9, lee, surrendered, to, grant, at, appomattox, officially, ending, the, war, lincoln, ran, for, reelection, in, 1864, while, uniting, the, main, republican, factions, along, with, war, democrats, edwin, m, stanton, and, andrew, johnson, lincoln, used, conversation, and, his, patronage, powers, greatly, expanded, from, peacetime, to, build, support, and, fend, off, the, radicals, efforts, to, replace, him, at, its, convention, the, republican, party, selected, johnson, as, his, running, mate, to, broaden, his, coalition, to, include, war, democrats, as, well, as, republicans, lincoln, ran, under, the, label, of, the, new, union, party, grant, s, bloody, stalemates, damaged, lincoln, s, re, election, prospects, and, many, republicans, feared, defeat, lincoln, confidentially, pledged, in, writing, that, if, he, should, lose, the, election, he, would, still, defeat, the, confederacy, before, turning, over, the, white, house, lincoln, did, not, show, the, pledge, to, his, cabinet, but, asked, them, to, sign, the, sealed, envelope, the, pledge, read, as, follows, this, morning, as, for, some, days, past, it, seems, exceedingly, probable, that, this, administration, will, not, be, re, elected, then, it, will, be, my, duty, to, so, co, operate, with, the, president, elect, as, to, save, the, union, between, the, election, and, the, inauguration, as, he, will, have, secured, his, election, on, such, ground, that, he, cannot, possibly, save, it, afterward, the, democratic, platform, followed, the, peace, wing, of, the, party, and, called, the, war, a, failure, but, their, candidate, mcclellan, supported, the, war, and, repudiated, the, platform, meanwhile, lincoln, emboldened, grant, with, more, troops, and, republican, party, support, sherman, s, capture, of, atlanta, in, september, and, david, farragut, s, capture, of, mobile, ended, defeatism, the, democratic, party, was, deeply, split, with, some, leaders, and, most, soldiers, openly, for, lincoln, the, national, union, party, was, united, by, lincoln, s, support, for, emancipation, state, republican, parties, stressed, the, perfidy, of, the, copperheads, on, november, 8, lincoln, carried, all, but, three, states, including, 78, percent, of, union, soldiers, on, march, 4, 1865, lincoln, delivered, his, second, inaugural, address, in, it, he, deemed, the, war, casualties, to, be, god, s, will, historian, mark, noll, places, the, speech, among, the, small, handful, of, semi, sacred, texts, by, which, americans, conceive, their, place, in, the, world, it, is, inscribed, in, the, lincoln, memorial, lincoln, said, fondly, do, we, hope, fervently, do, we, pray, that, this, mighty, scourge, of, war, may, speedily, pass, away, yet, if, god, wills, that, it, continue, until, all, the, wealth, piled, by, the, bond, man, s, two, hundred, and, fifty, years, of, unrequited, toil, shall, be, sunk, and, until, every, drop, of, blood, drawn, with, the, lash, shall, be, paid, by, another, drawn, with, the, sword, as, was, said, three, thousand, years, ago, so, still, it, must, be, said, the, judgments, of, the, lord, are, true, and, righteous, altogether, with, malice, toward, none, with, charity, for, all, with, firmness, in, the, right, as, god, gives, us, to, see, the, right, let, us, strive, on, to, finish, the, work, we, are, in, to, bind, up, the, nation, s, wounds, to, care, for, him, who, shall, have, borne, the, battle, and, for, his, widow, and, his, orphan, to, do, all, which, may, achieve, and, cherish, a, just, and, lasting, peace, among, ourselves, and, with, all, nations, among, those, present, for, this, speech, was, actor, john, wilkes, booth, who, on, april, 14, 1865, just, over, a, month, after, lincoln, s, second, inauguration, assassinated, him, reconstruction, preceded, the, war, s, end, as, lincoln, and, his, associates, considered, the, reintegration, of, the, nation, and, the, fates, of, confederate, leaders, and, freed, slaves, when, a, general, asked, lincoln, how, the, defeated, confederates, were, to, be, treated, lincoln, replied, let, em, up, easy, lincoln, was, determined, to, find, meaning, in, the, war, in, its, aftermath, and, did, not, want, to, continue, to, outcast, the, southern, states, his, main, goal, was, to, keep, the, union, together, so, he, proceeded, by, focusing, not, on, whom, to, blame, but, on, how, to, rebuild, the, nation, as, one, lincoln, led, the, moderates, in, reconstruction, policy, and, was, opposed, by, the, radicals, under, rep, thaddeus, stevens, sen, charles, sumner, and, sen, benjamin, wade, who, otherwise, remained, lincoln, s, allies, determined, to, reunite, the, nation, and, not, alienate, the, south, lincoln, urged, that, speedy, elections, under, generous, terms, be, held, his, amnesty, proclamation, of, december, 8, 1863, offered, pardons, to, those, who, had, not, held, a, confederate, civil, office, and, had, not, mistreated, union, prisoners, if, they, were, willing, to, sign, an, oath, of, allegiance, as, southern, states, fell, they, needed, leaders, while, their, administrations, were, restored, in, tennessee, and, arkansas, lincoln, respectively, appointed, johnson, and, frederick, steele, as, military, governors, in, louisiana, lincoln, ordered, general, nathaniel, p, banks, to, promote, a, plan, that, would, reestablish, statehood, when, 10, percent, of, the, voters, agreed, and, only, if, the, reconstructed, states, abolished, slavery, democratic, opponents, accused, lincoln, of, using, the, military, to, ensure, his, and, the, republicans, political, aspirations, the, radicals, denounced, his, policy, as, too, lenient, and, passed, their, own, plan, the, 1864, wade, davis, bill, which, lincoln, vetoed, the, radicals, retaliated, by, refusing, to, seat, elected, representatives, from, louisiana, arkansas, and, tennessee, lincoln, s, appointments, were, designed, to, harness, both, moderates, and, radicals, to, fill, chief, justice, taney, s, seat, on, the, supreme, court, he, named, the, radicals, choice, salmon, p, chase, whom, lincoln, believed, would, uphold, his, emancipation, and, paper, money, policies, after, implementing, the, emancipation, proclamation, lincoln, increased, pressure, on, congress, to, outlaw, slavery, throughout, the, nation, with, a, constitutional, amendment, he, declared, that, such, an, amendment, would, clinch, the, whole, subject, and, by, december, 1863, an, amendment, was, brought, to, congress, the, senate, passed, it, on, april, 8, 1864, but, the, first, vote, in, the, house, of, representatives, fell, short, of, the, required, two, thirds, majority, passage, became, part, of, lincoln, s, reelection, platform, and, after, his, successful, reelection, the, second, attempt, in, the, house, passed, on, january, 31, 1865, with, ratification, it, became, the, thirteenth, amendment, to, the, united, states, constitution, on, december, 6, 1865, lincoln, believed, the, federal, government, had, limited, responsibility, to, the, millions, of, freedmen, he, signed, senator, charles, sumner, s, freedmen, s, bureau, bill, that, set, up, a, temporary, federal, agency, designed, to, meet, the, immediate, needs, of, former, slaves, the, law, opened, land, for, a, lease, of, three, years, with, the, ability, to, purchase, title, for, the, freedmen, lincoln, announced, a, reconstruction, plan, that, involved, short, term, military, control, pending, readmission, under, the, control, of, southern, unionists, historians, agree, that, it, is, impossible, to, predict, how, reconstruction, would, have, proceeded, had, lincoln, lived, biographers, james, g, randall, and, richard, current, according, to, david, lincove, argue, that, it, is, likely, that, had, he, lived, lincoln, would, have, followed, a, policy, similar, to, johnson, s, that, he, would, have, clashed, with, congressional, radicals, that, he, would, have, produced, a, better, result, for, the, freedmen, than, occurred, and, that, his, political, skills, would, have, helped, him, avoid, johnson, s, mistakes, eric, foner, argues, that, unlike, sumner, and, other, radicals, lincoln, did, not, see, reconstruction, as, an, opportunity, for, a, sweeping, political, and, social, revolution, beyond, emancipation, he, had, long, made, clear, his, opposition, to, the, confiscation, and, redistribution, of, land, he, believed, as, most, republicans, did, in, april, 1865, that, voting, requirements, should, be, determined, by, the, states, he, assumed, that, political, control, in, the, south, would, pass, to, white, unionists, reluctant, secessionists, and, forward, looking, former, confederates, but, time, and, again, during, the, war, lincoln, after, initial, opposition, had, come, to, embrace, positions, first, advanced, by, abolitionists, and, radical, republicans, lincoln, undoubtedly, would, have, listened, carefully, to, the, outcry, for, further, protection, for, the, former, slaves, it, is, entirely, plausible, to, imagine, lincoln, and, congress, agreeing, on, a, reconstruction, policy, that, encompassed, federal, protection, for, basic, civil, rights, plus, limited, black, suffrage, along, the, lines, lincoln, proposed, just, before, his, death, lincoln, s, relationship, with, native, americans, started, before, he, was, born, with, their, killing, of, his, grandfather, in, front, of, his, sons, including, lincoln, s, father, thomas, lincoln, himself, served, as, a, captain, in,

the, area, now, known, as, yosemite, national, park, lincoln, s, philosophy, on, court, nominations, was, that, we, cannot, ask, a, man, what, he, will, do, and, if, we, should, and, he, should, answer, us, we, should, despise, him, for, it, therefore, we, must, take, a, man, whose, opinions, are, known, lincoln, made, five, appointments, to, the, supreme, court, noah, haynes, swayne, was, an, anti, slavery, lawyer, who, was, committed, to, the, union, samuel, freeman, miller, supported, lincoln, in, the, 1860, election, and, was, an, avowed, abolitionist, david, davis, was, lincoln, s,

most, diplomatic, issues, in, seward, s, portfolio, however, lincoln, did, select, some, top, diplomats, as, part, of, his, patronage, policy, he, also, closely, watched, the, handling, of, the, trent, affair, in, late, 1861, to, make, sure, the, situation, did, not, escalate, into, war, with, britain, seward, s, main, role, was, to, keep, britain, and, france, from, supporting, the, confederacy, he, was, successful, after, indicating, to, britain, and, france, that, the, union, would, declare, war, on, them, if, they, supported, the, south, john, wilkes, booth, was, a, well, known, actor, and, a, confederate, spy, from, maryland, though, he, never, joined, the, confederate, army, he, had, contacts, with, the, confederate, secret, service, after, attending, lincoln, s, last, public, address, on, april, 11, 1865, in, which, lincoln, stated, his, preference, that, the, franchise, be, conferred, on, some, black, men, specifically, on, the, very, intelligent, and, on, those, who, serve, our, cause, as, soldiers, booth, hatched, a, plot, to, assassinate, the, president, when, booth, learned, of, the, lincolns, intent, to, attend, a, play, with, general, grant, he, planned, to, assassinate, lincoln, and, grant, at, ford, s, theatre, lincoln, and, his, wife, attended, the, play, our, american, cousin, on, the, evening, of, april, 14, just, five, days, after, the, union, victory, at, the, battle, of, appomattox, courthouse, at, the, last, minute, grant, decided, to, go, to, new, jersey, to, visit, his, children, instead, of, attending, the, play, at, 10, 15,

the, street, to, petersen, house, after, remaining, in, a, coma, for, eight, hours, lincoln, died, at, 7, 22, in, the, morning, on, april, 15, stanton, saluted, and, said, now, he, belongs, to, the, ages, lincoln, s, body, was, placed, in, a, flag, wrapped, coffin, which, was, loaded, into, a, hearse, and, escorted, to, the, white, house, by, union, soldiers, president, johnson, was, sworn, in, later, that, same, day, two, weeks, later, booth, refusing, to, surrender, was, tracked, to, a, farm, in, virginia, he, was, mortally, shot, by, sergeant, boston, corbett, and, died, on, april, 26, secretary, of, war, stanton, had, issued, orders, that, booth, be, taken, alive, so, corbett, was, initially, arrested, to, be, court, martialed, after, a, brief, interview, stanton, declared, him, a, patriot, and, dismissed, the, charge, the, late, president, lay, in, state, first, in, the, east, room, of, the, white, house, and, then, in, the, capitol, rotunda, from, april, 19, to, 21, the, caskets, containing, lincoln, s, body, and, the, body, of, his, son, willie, traveled, for, three, weeks, on, the, lincoln, special, funeral, train, the, train, followed, a, circuitous, route, from, washington, d, c, to, springfield, illinois, stopping, at, many, cities, for, memorials, attended, by, hundreds, of, thousands, many, others, gathered, along, the, tracks, as, the, train, passed, with, bands, bonfires, and, hymn, singing, or, in, silent, grief, poet, walt, whitman, composed, when, lilacs, last, in, the, dooryard, bloom, d, to, eulogize, him, one, of, four, poems, he, wrote, about, lincoln, african, americans, were, especially, moved, they, had, lost, their, moses, in, a, larger, sense, the, reaction, was, in, response, to, the, deaths, of, so, many, men, in, the, war, historians, emphasized, the, widespread, shock, and, sorrow, but, noted, that, some, lincoln, haters, celebrated, his, death, lincoln, s, body, was, buried, at, oak, ridge, cemetery, in, springfield, and, now, lies, within, the, lincoln, tomb, as, a, young, man, lincoln, was, a, religious, skeptic, he, was, deeply, familiar, with, the, bible, quoting, and, praising, it, he, was, private, about, his, position, on, organized, religion, and, respected, the, beliefs, of, others, he, never, made, a, clear, profession, of, christian, beliefs, throughout, his, public, career, lincoln, often, quoted, scripture, his, three, most, famous, speeches, the, house, divided, speech, the, gettysburg, address, and, his, second, inaugural, all, contain, direct, allusions, to, providence, and, quote, from, scripture, in, the, 1840s, lincoln, subscribed, to, the, doctrine, of, necessity, a, belief, that, the, human, mind, was, controlled, by, a, higher, power, with, the, death, of, his, son, edward, in, 1850, he, more, frequently, expressed, a, dependence, on, god, he, never, joined, a, church, although, he, frequently, attended, first, presbyterian, church, with, his, wife, beginning, in, 1852, in, the, 1850s, lincoln, asserted, his, belief, in, providence, in, a, general, way, and, rarely, used, the, language, or, imagery, of, the, evangelicals, instead, he, regarded, the, republicanism, of, the, founding, fathers, with, an, almost, religious, reverence, the, death, of, his, son, willie, in, february, 1862, may, have, caused, him, to, look, toward, religion, for, solace, after, willie, s, death, he, questioned, the, divine, necessity, of, the, war, s, severity, he, wrote, at, this, time, that, god, could, have, either, saved, or, destroyed, the, union, without, a, human, contest, yet, the, contest, began, and, having, begun, he, could, give, the, final, victory, to, either, side, any, day, yet, the, contest, proceeds, lincoln, did, believe, in, an, all, powerful, god, that, shaped, events, and, by, 1865, was, expressing, that, belief, in, major, speeches, by, the, end, of, the, war, he, increasingly, appealed, to, the, almighty, for, solace, and, to, explain, events, writing, on, april, 4, 1864, to, a, newspaper, editor, in, kentucky, i, claim, not, to, have, controlled, events, but, confess, plainly, that, events, have, controlled, me, now, at, the, end, of, three, years, struggle, the, nation, s, condition, is, not, what, either, party, or, any, man, devised, or, expected, god, alone, can, claim, it, whither, it, is, tending, seems, plain, if, god, now, wills, the, removal, of, a, great, wrong, and, wills, also, that, we, of, the, north, as, well, as, you, of, the, south, shall, pay, fairly, for, our, complicity, in, that, wrong, impartial, history, will, find, therein, new, cause, to, attest, and, revere, the, justice, and, goodness, of, god, this, spirituality, can, best, be, seen, in, his, second, inaugural, address, considered, by, some, scholars, as, the, greatest, such, address, in, american, history, and, by, lincoln, himself, as, his, own, greatest, speech, or, one, of, them, at, the, very, least, lincoln, explains, therein, that, the, cause, purpose, and, result, of, the, war, was, god, s, will, lincoln, s, frequent, use, of, religious, imagery, and, language, toward, the, end, of, his, life, may, have, reflected, his, own, personal, beliefs, or, might, have, been, a, device, to, reach, his, audiences, who, were, mostly, evangelical, protestants, on, the, day, lincoln, was, assassinated, he, reportedly, told, his, wife, he, desired, to, visit, the, holy, land, lincoln, is, believed, to, have, had, depression, smallpox, and, malaria, he, took, blue, mass, pills, which, contained, mercury, to, treat, constipation, it, is, unknown, to, what, extent, this, may, have, resulted, in, mercury, poisoning, several, claims, have, been, made, that, lincoln, s, health, was, declining, before, the, assassination, these, are, often, based, on, photographs, of, lincoln, appearing, to, show, weight, loss, and, muscle, wasting, it, is, also, suspected, that, he, might, have, had, a, rare, genetic, disease, such, as, marfan, syndrome, or, multiple, endocrine, neoplasia, type, 2b, lincoln, s, redefinition, of, republican, values, has, been, stressed, by, historians, such, as, john, patrick, diggins, harry, v, jaffa, vernon, burton, eric, foner, and, herman, j, belz, lincoln, called, the, declaration, of, independence, which, emphasized, freedom, and, equality, for, all, the, sheet, anchor, of, republicanism, beginning, in, the, 1850s, he, did, this, at, a, time, when, the, constitution, which, tolerated, slavery, was, the, focus, of, most, political, discourse, diggins, notes, lincoln, presented, americans, a, theory, of, history, that, offers, a, profound, contribution, to, the, theory, and, destiny, of, republicanism, itself, in, the, 1860, cooper, union, speech, instead, of, focusing, on, the, legality, of, an, argument, he, focused, on, the, moral, basis, of, republicanism, his, position, on, war, was, founded, on, a, legal, argument, regarding, the, constitution, as, essentially, a, contract, among, the, states, and, all, parties, must, agree, to, pull, out, of, the, contract, furthermore, it, was, a, national, duty, to, ensure, the, republic, stands, in, every, state, many, soldiers, and, religious, leaders, from, the, north, though, felt, the, fight, for, liberty, and, freedom, of, slaves, was, ordained, by, their, moral, and, religious, beliefs, as, a, whig, activist, lincoln, was, a, spokesman, for, business, interests, favoring, high, tariffs, banks, infrastructure, improvements, and, railroads, in, opposition, to, jacksonian, democrats, lincoln, shared, the, sympathies, that, the, jacksonians, professed, for, the, common, man, but, he, disagreed, with, the, jacksonian, view, that, the, government, should, be, divorced, from, economic, enterprise, nevertheless, lincoln, admired, andrew, jackson, s, steeliness, as, well, as, his, patriotism, according, to, historian, sean, wilentz, just, as, the, republican, party, of, the, 1850s, absorbed, certain, elements, of, jacksonianism, so, lincoln, whose, whiggery, had, always, been, more, egalitarian, than, that, of, other, whigs, found, himself, absorbing, some, of, them, as, well, and, some, of, the, jacksonian, spirit, resided, inside, the, lincoln, white, house, william, c, harris, found, that, lincoln, s, reverence, for, the, founding, fathers, the, constitution, the, laws, under, it, and, the, preservation, of, the, republic, and, its, institutions, strengthened, his, conservatism, james, g, randall, emphasizes, his, tolerance, and, moderation, in, his, preference, for, orderly, progress, his, distrust, of, dangerous, agitation, and, his, reluctance, toward, ill, digested, schemes, of, reform, randall, concludes, that, he, was, conservative, in, his, complete, avoidance, of, that, type, of, so, called, radicalism, which, involved, abuse, of, the, south, hatred, for, the, slaveholder, thirst, for, vengeance, partisan, plotting, and, ungenerous, demands, that, southern, institutions, be, transformed, overnight, by, outsiders, in, lincoln, s, first, inaugural, address, he, explored, the, nature, of, democracy, he, denounced, secession, as, anarchy, and, he, explained, that, majority, rule, had, to, be, balanced, by, constitutional, restraints, he, said, a, majority, held, in, restraint, by, constitutional, checks, and, limitations, and, always, changing, easily, with, deliberate, changes, of, popular, opinions, and, sentiments, is, the, only, true, sovereign, of, a, free, people, the, successful, reunification, of, the, states, had, consequences, for, how, people, viewed, the, country, the, term, the, united, states, has, historically, been, used, sometimes, in, the, plural, these, united, states, and, other, times, in, the, singular, the, civil, war, was, a, significant, force, in, the, eventual, dominance, of, the, singular, usage, by, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, his, company, i, was, never, reminded, of, my, humble, origin, or, of, my, unpopular, color, in, surveys, of, u, s, scholars, ranking, presidents, conducted, since, 1948, the, top, three, presidents, are, generally, lincoln, washington, and, franklin, delano, roosevelt, although, the, order, varies, between, 1999, and, 2011, lincoln, john, f, kennedy, and, ronald, reagan, were, the, top, ranked, presidents, in, eight, public, opinion, surveys, according, to, gallup, a, 2004, study, found, that, scholars, in, the, fields, of, history, and, politics, ranked, lincoln, number, one, while, legal, scholars, placed, him, second, after, george, washington, lincoln, s, assassination, left, him, a, national, martyr, he, was, viewed, by, abolitionists, as, a, champion, of, human, liberty, republicans, linked, lincoln, s, name, to, their, party, many, though, not, all, in, the, south, considered, lincoln, as, a, man, of, outstanding, ability, historians, have, said, he, was, a, classical, liberal, in, the, 19th, century, sense, allen, c, guelzo, states, that, lincoln, was, a, classical, liberal, democrat, an, enemy, of, artificial, hierarchy, a, friend, to, trade, and, business, as, ennobling, and, enabling, and, an, american, counterpart, to, mill, cobden, and, bright, whose, portrait, lincoln, hung, in, his, white, house, office, sociologist, barry, schwartz, argues, that, lincoln, s, american, reputation, grew, slowly, from, the, late, 19th, century, until, the, progressive, era, 1900, 1920s, when, he, emerged, as, one, of, america, s, most, venerated, heroes, even, among, white, southerners, the, high, point, came, in, 1922, with, the, dedication, of, the, lincoln, memorial, on, the, national, mall, in, washington, d, c, union, nationalism, as, envisioned, by, lincoln, helped, lead, america, to, the, nationalism, of, theodore, roosevelt, woodrow, wilson, and, franklin, delano, roosevelt, in, the, new, deal, era, liberals, honored, lincoln, not, so, much, as, the, self, made, man, or, the, great, war, president, but, as, the, advocate, of, the, common, man, who, they, claimed, would, have, supported, the, welfare, state, schwartz, argues, that, in, the, 1930s, and, 1940s, the, memory, of, abraham, lincoln, was, practically, sacred, and, provided, the, nation, with, a, moral, symbol, inspiring, and, guiding, american, life, during, the, great, depression, he, argues, lincoln, served, as, a, means, for, seeing, the, world, s, disappointments, for, making, its, sufferings, not, so, much, explicable, as, meaningful, franklin, d, roosevelt, preparing, america, for, war, used, the, words, of, the, civil, war, president, to, clarify, the, threat, posed, by, germany, and, japan, americans, asked, what, would, lincoln, do, however, schwartz, also, finds, that, since, world, war, ii, lincoln, s, symbolic, power, has, lost, relevance, and, this, fading, hero, is, symptomatic, of, fading, confidence, in, national, greatness, he, suggested, that, postmodernism, and, multiculturalism, have, diluted, greatness, as, a, concept, in, the, cold, war, years, lincoln, s, image, shifted, to, a, symbol, of, freedom, who, brought, hope, to, those, oppressed, by, communist, regimes, he, had, long, been, known, as, the, great, emancipator, but, by, the, late, 1960s, some, african, american, intellectuals, led, by, lerone, bennett, jr, denied, that, lincoln, deserved, that, title, bennett, won, wide, attention, when, he, called, lincoln, a, white, supremacist, in, 1968, he, noted, that, lincoln, used, ethnic, slurs, and, told, jokes, that, ridiculed, blacks, bennett, argued, that, lincoln, opposed, social, equality, and, proposed, that, freed, slaves, voluntarily, move, to, another, country, the, emphasis, shifted, away, from, lincoln, the, emancipator, to, an, argument, that, blacks, had, freed, themselves, from, slavery, or, at, least, were, responsible, for, pressuring, the, government, to, emancipate, them, defenders, of, lincoln, retorted, that, he, was, a, moral, visionary, who, deftly, advanced, the, abolitionist, cause, as, fast, as, politically, possible, brian, dirck, stated, that, few, civil, war, scholars, take, bennett, or, thomas, dilorenzo, seriously, pointing, to, their, narrow, political, agendas, and, faulty, research, by, the, 1970s, lincoln, had, become, a, hero, to, political, conservatives, apart, from, neo, confederates, such, as, mel, bradford, who, denounced, his, treatment, of, the, white, south, for, his, intense, nationalism, his, support, for, business, his, insistence, on, stopping, the, spread, of, slavery, his, acting, on, lockean, and, burkean, principles, on, behalf, of, both, liberty, and, tradition, and, his, devotion, to, the, principles, of, the, founding, fathers, lincoln, became, a,
