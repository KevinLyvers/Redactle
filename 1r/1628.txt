paul, adrien, maurice, dirac, om, frs, d, r, k, 8, august, 1902, 20, october, 1984, was, an, english, mathematical, and, theoretical, physicist, who, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, founders, of, quantum, mechanics, dirac, laid, the, foundations, for, both, quantum, electrodynamics, and, quantum, field, theory, he, was, the, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, cambridge, a, professor, of, physics, at, florida, state, university, and, a, 1933, nobel, prize, in, physics, recipient, dirac, graduated, from, the, university, of, bristol, with, a, first, class, honours, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1921, and, a, first, class, honours, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, mathematics, in, 1923, dirac, then, graduated, from, the, university, of, cambridge, with, a, phd, in, physics, in, 1926, writing, the, first, ever, thesis, on, quantum, mechanics, dirac, made, fundamental, contributions, to, the, early, development, of, both, quantum, mechanics, and, quantum, electrodynamics, coining, the, latter, term, among, other, discoveries, he, formulated, the, dirac, equation, in, 1928, which, describes, the, behaviour, of, fermions, and, predicted, the, existence, of, antimatter, which, is, one, of, the, most, important, equations, in, physics, and, is, regarded, by, some, physicists, as, the, real, seed, of, modern, physics, he, wrote, a, famous, paper, in, 1931, which, further, predicted, the, existence, of, antimatter, dirac, shared, the, 1933, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, erwin, schr, dinger, for, the, discovery, of, new, productive, forms, of, atomic, theory, he, was, the, youngest, ever, theoretician, to, win, the, prize, until, t, d, lee, in, 1957, dirac, also, contributed, greatly, to, the, reconciliation, of, general, relativity, with, quantum, mechanics, his, 1930, monograph, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, is, one, of, the, most, influential, texts, on, quantum, mechanics, dirac, s, contributions, were, not, restricted, to, quantum, mechanics, he, contributed, to, the, tube, alloys, project, the, british, programme, to, research, and, construct, atomic, bombs, during, world, war, ii, dirac, made, fundamental, contributions, to, the, process, of, uranium, enrichment, and, the, gas, centrifuge, and, whose, work, was, deemed, to, be, probably, the, most, important, theoretical, result, in, centrifuge, technology, he, also, contributed, to, cosmology, putting, forth, his, large, numbers, hypothesis, dirac, also, anticipated, string, theory, well, before, its, inception, with, work, such, as, the, dirac, membrane, and, dirac, born, infeld, action, along, with, other, contributions, important, to, modern, day, string, and, gauge, theories, dirac, was, regarded, by, his, friends, and, colleagues, as, unusual, in, character, in, a, 1926, letter, to, paul, ehrenfest, albert, einstein, wrote, of, a, dirac, paper, i, am, toiling, over, dirac, this, balancing, on, the, dizzying, path, between, genius, and, madness, is, awful, in, another, letter, concerning, the, compton, effect, he, wrote, i, don, t, understand, the, details, of, dirac, at, all, in, 1987, abdus, salam, declared, that, dirac, was, undoubtedly, one, of, the, greatest, physicists, of, this, or, any, century, no, man, except, einstein, has, had, such, a, decisive, influence, in, so, short, a, time, on, the, course, of, physics, in, this, century, in, 1995, stephen, hawking, stated, that, dirac, has, done, more, than, anyone, this, century, with, the, exception, of, einstein, to, advance, physics, and, change, our, picture, of, the, universe, antonino, zichichi, asserted, that, dirac, had, a, greater, impact, on, modern, physics, than, einstein, while, stanley, deser, remarked, that, we, all, stand, on, dirac, s, shoulders, dirac, is, widely, considered, to, be, on, par, with, sir, isaac, newton, james, clerk, maxwell, and, einstein, paul, adrien, maurice, dirac, was, born, at, his, parents, home, in, bristol, england, on, 8, august, 1902, and, grew, up, in, the, bishopston, area, of, the, city, his, father, charles, adrien, ladislas, dirac, was, an, immigrant, from, saint, maurice, switzerland, of, french, descent, who, worked, in, bristol, as, a, french, teacher, his, mother, florence, hannah, dirac, n, e, holten, was, born, to, a, cornish, methodist, family, in, liskeard, cornwall, she, was, named, after, florence, nightingale, by, her, father, a, ship, s, captain, who, had, met, nightingale, while, he, was, a, soldier, during, the, crimean, war, his, mother, moved, to, bristol, as, a, young, woman, where, she, worked, as, a, librarian, at, the, bristol, central, library, despite, this, she, still, considered, her, identity, to, be, cornish, rather, than, english, paul, had, a, younger, sister, b, atrice, isabelle, marguerite, known, as, betty, and, an, older, brother, reginald, charles, f, lix, known, as, felix, who, died, by, suicide, in, march, 1925, dirac, later, recalled, my, parents, were, terribly, distressed, i, didn, t, know, they, cared, so, much, i, never, knew, that, parents, were, supposed, to, care, for, their, children, but, from, then, on, i, knew, charles, and, the, children, were, officially, swiss, nationals, until, they, became, naturalised, on, 22, october, 1919, dirac, s, father, was, strict, and, authoritarian, although, he, disapproved, of, corporal, punishment, dirac, had, a, strained, relationship, with, his, father, so, much, so, that, after, his, father, s, death, dirac, wrote, i, feel, much, freer, now, and, i, am, my, own, man, charles, forced, his, children, to, speak, to, him, only, in, french, so, that, they, might, learn, the, language, when, dirac, found, that, he, could, not, express, what, he, wanted, to, say, in, french, he, chose, to, remain, silent, dirac, was, educated, first, at, bishop, road, primary, school, and, then, at, the, all, boys, merchant, venturers, technical, college, later, cotham, school, where, his, father, was, a, french, teacher, the, school, was, an, institution, attached, to, the, university, of, bristol, which, shared, grounds, and, staff, it, emphasised, technical, subjects, like, bricklaying, shoemaking, and, metalwork, and, modern, languages, this, was, unusual, at, a, time, when, secondary, education, in, britain, was, still, dedicated, largely, to, the, classics, and, something, for, which, dirac, would, later, express, his, gratitude, dirac, studied, electrical, engineering, on, a, city, of, bristol, university, scholarship, at, the, university, of, bristol, s, engineering, faculty, which, was, co, located, with, the, merchant, venturers, technical, college, shortly, before, he, completed, his, degree, in, 1921, he, sat, for, the, entrance, examination, for, st, john, s, college, cambridge, he, passed, and, was, awarded, a, 70, scholarship, but, this, fell, short, of, the, amount, of, money, required, to, live, and, study, at, cambridge, despite, having, graduated, with, a, first, class, honours, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, electrical, engineering, the, economic, climate, of, the, post, war, depression, was, such, that, he, was, unable, to, find, work, as, an, engineer, instead, he, took, up, an, offer, to, study, for, a, bachelor, of, arts, degree, in, mathematics, at, the, university, of, bristol, free, of, charge, he, was, permitted, to, skip, the, first, year, of, the, course, owing, to, his, engineering, degree, under, the, influence, of, peter, fraser, whom, dirac, called, the, best, mathematics, teacher, he, had, the, most, interest, in, projective, geometry, and, began, applying, it, to, the, geometrical, version, of, relativity, minkowski, developed, in, 1923, dirac, graduated, once, again, with, first, class, honours, and, received, a, 140, scholarship, from, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, along, with, his, 70, scholarship, from, st, john, s, college, this, was, enough, to, live, at, cambridge, there, dirac, pursued, his, interests, in, the, theory, of, general, relativity, an, interest, he, had, gained, earlier, as, a, student, in, bristol, and, in, the, nascent, field, of, quantum, physics, under, the, supervision, of, ralph, fowler, from, 1925, to, 1928, he, held, an, 1851, research, fellowship, from, the, royal, commission, for, the, exhibition, of, 1851, he, completed, his, phd, in, june, 1926, with, the, first, thesis, on, quantum, mechanics, to, be, submitted, anywhere, he, then, continued, his, research, in, copenhagen, and, g, ttingen, in, the, spring, of, 1929, he, was, a, visiting, professor, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, madison, in, 1937, dirac, married, margit, wigner, a, sister, of, physicist, eugene, wigner, and, a, divorcee, dirac, raised, margit, s, two, children, judith, and, gabriel, as, if, they, were, his, own, paul, and, margit, dirac, also, had, two, daughters, together, mary, elizabeth, and, florence, monica, margit, known, as, manci, had, visited, her, brother, in, 1934, in, princeton, new, jersey, from, their, native, hungary, and, while, at, dinner, at, the, annex, restaurant, met, the, lonely, looking, man, at, the, next, table, this, account, from, a, korean, physicist, y, s, kim, who, met, and, was, influenced, by, dirac, also, says, it, is, quite, fortunate, for, the, physics, community, that, manci, took, good, care, of, our, respected, paul, a, m, dirac, dirac, published, eleven, papers, during, the, period, 1939, 46, dirac, was, able, to, maintain, his, normal, research, productivity, only, because, manci, was, in, charge, of, everything, else, dirac, was, known, among, his, colleagues, for, his, precise, and, taciturn, nature, his, colleagues, in, cambridge, jokingly, defined, a, unit, called, a, dirac, which, was, one, word, per, hour, when, niels, bohr, complained, that, he, did, not, know, how, to, finish, a, sentence, in, a, scientific, article, he, was, writing, dirac, replied, i, was, taught, at, school, never, to, start, a, sentence, without, knowing, the, end, of, it, he, criticised, the, physicist, j, robert, oppenheimer, s, interest, in, poetry, the, aim, of, science, is, to, make, difficult, things, understandable, in, a, simpler, way, the, aim, of, poetry, is, to, state, simple, things, in, an, incomprehensible, way, the, two, are, incompatible, dirac, himself, wrote, in, his, diary, during, his, postgraduate, years, that, he, concentrated, solely, on, his, research, and, stopped, only, on, sunday, when, he, took, long, strolls, alone, an, anecdote, recounted, in, a, review, of, the, 2009, biography, tells, of, werner, heisenberg, and, dirac, sailing, on, an, ocean, liner, to, a, conference, in, japan, in, august, 1929, both, still, in, their, twenties, and, unmarried, they, made, an, odd, couple, heisenberg, was, a, ladies, man, who, constantly, flirted, and, danced, while, dirac, an, edwardian, geek, as, biographer, graham, farmelo, puts, it, suffered, agonies, if, forced, into, any, kind, of, socializing, or, small, talk, why, do, you, dance, dirac, asked, his, companion, when, there, are, nice, girls, it, is, a, pleasure, heisenberg, replied, dirac, pondered, this, notion, then, blurted, out, but, heisenberg, how, do, you, know, beforehand, that, the, girls, are, nice, margit, dirac, told, both, george, gamow, and, anton, capri, in, the, 1960s, that, her, husband, had, said, to, a, house, visitor, allow, me, to, present, wigner, s, sister, who, is, now, my, wife, another, story, told, of, dirac, is, that, when, he, first, met, the, young, richard, feynman, at, a, conference, he, said, after, a, long, silence, i, have, an, equation, do, you, have, one, too, after, he, presented, a, lecture, at, a, conference, one, colleague, raised, his, hand, and, said, i, don, t, understand, the, equation, on, the, top, right, hand, corner, of, the, blackboard, after, a, long, silence, the, moderator, asked, dirac, if, he, wanted, to, answer, the, question, to, which, dirac, replied, that, was, not, a, question, it, was, a, comment, dirac, was, also, noted, for, his, personal, modesty, he, called, the, equation, for, the, time, evolution, of, a, quantum, mechanical, operator, which, he, was, the, first, to, write, down, the, heisenberg, equation, of, motion, most, physicists, speak, of, fermi, dirac, statistics, for, half, integer, spin, particles, and, bose, einstein, statistics, for, integer, spin, particles, while, lecturing, later, in, life, dirac, always, insisted, on, calling, the, former, fermi, statistics, he, referred, to, the, latter, as, bose, statistics, for, reasons, he, explained, of, symmetry, heisenberg, recollected, a, conversation, among, young, participants, at, the, 1927, solvay, conference, about, einstein, and, planck, s, views, on, religion, between, wolfgang, pauli, heisenberg, and, dirac, dirac, s, contribution, was, a, criticism, of, the, political, purpose, of, religion, which, bohr, regarded, as, quite, lucid, when, hearing, it, from, heisenberg, later, among, other, things, heisenberg, imagined, that, dirac, might, say, i, don, t, know, why, we, are, discussing, religion, if, we, are, honest, and, scientists, have, to, be, we, must, admit, that, religion, is, a, jumble, of, false, assertions, with, no, basis, in, reality, the, very, idea, of, god, is, a, product, of, the, human, imagination, it, is, quite, understandable, why, primitive, people, who, were, so, much, more, exposed, to, the, overpowering, forces, of, nature, than, we, are, today, should, have, personified, these, forces, in, fear, and, trembling, but, nowadays, when, we, understand, so, many, natural, processes, we, have, no, need, for, such, solutions, i, can, t, for, the, life, of, me, see, how, the, postulate, of, an, almighty, god, helps, us, in, any, way, what, i, do, see, is, that, this, assumption, leads, to, such, unproductive, questions, as, to, why, god, allows, so, much, misery, and, injustice, the, exploitation, of, the, poor, by, the, rich, and, all, the, other, horrors, he, might, have, prevented, if, religion, is, still, being, taught, it, is, by, no, means, because, its, ideas, still, convince, us, but, simply, because, some, of, us, want, to, keep, the, lower, classes, quiet, quiet, people, are, much, easier, to, govern, than, clamorous, and, dissatisfied, ones, they, are, also, much, easier, to, exploit, religion, is, a, kind, of, opium, that, allows, a, nation, to, lull, itself, into, wishful, dreams, and, so, forget, the, injustices, that, are, being, perpetrated, against, the, people, hence, the, close, alliance, between, those, two, great, political, forces, the, state, and, the, church, both, need, the, illusion, that, a, kindly, god, rewards, in, heaven, if, not, on, earth, all, those, who, have, not, risen, up, against, injustice, who, have, done, their, duty, quietly, and, uncomplainingly, that, is, precisely, why, the, honest, assertion, that, god, is, a, mere, product, of, the, human, imagination, is, branded, as, the, worst, of, all, mortal, sins, heisenberg, s, view, was, tolerant, pauli, raised, as, a, catholic, had, kept, silent, after, some, initial, remarks, but, when, finally, he, was, asked, for, his, opinion, said, well, our, friend, dirac, has, got, a, religion, and, its, guiding, principle, is, there, is, no, god, and, paul, dirac, is, his, prophet, everybody, including, dirac, burst, into, laughter, later, in, life, dirac, wrote, an, article, mentioning, god, that, appeared, in, the, may, 1963, edition, of, scientific, american, dirac, wrote, it, seems, to, be, one, of, the, fundamental, features, of, nature, that, fundamental, physical, laws, are, described, in, terms, of, a, mathematical, theory, of, great, beauty, and, power, needing, quite, a, high, standard, of, mathematics, for, one, to, understand, it, you, may, wonder, why, is, nature, constructed, along, these, lines, one, can, only, answer, that, our, present, knowledge, seems, to, show, that, nature, is, so, constructed, we, simply, have, to, accept, it, one, could, perhaps, describe, the, situation, by, saying, that, god, is, a, mathematician, of, a, very, high, order, and, he, used, very, advanced, mathematics, in, constructing, the, universe, our, feeble, attempts, at, mathematics, enable, us, to, understand, a, bit, of, the, universe, and, as, we, proceed, to, develop, higher, and, higher, mathematics, we, can, hope, to, understand, the, universe, better, in, 1971, at, a, conference, meeting, dirac, expressed, his, views, on, the, existence, of, god, dirac, explained, that, the, existence, of, god, could, be, justified, only, if, an, improbable, event, were, to, have, taken, place, in, the, past, it, could, be, that, it, is, extremely, difficult, to, start, life, it, might, be, that, it, is, so, difficult, to, start, a, life, that, it, has, happened, only, once, among, all, the, planets, let, us, consider, just, as, a, conjecture, that, the, chance, of, life, starting, when, we, have, got, suitable, physical, conditions, is, 10, 100, i, don, t, have, any, logical, reason, for, proposing, this, figure, i, just, want, you, to, consider, it, as, a, possibility, under, those, conditions, it, is, almost, certain, that, life, would, not, have, started, and, i, feel, that, under, those, conditions, it, will, be, necessary, to, assume, the, existence, of, a, god, to, start, off, life, i, would, like, therefore, to, set, up, this, connection, between, the, existence, of, a, god, and, the, physical, laws, if, physical, laws, are, such, that, to, start, off, life, involves, an, excessively, small, chance, so, that, it, will, not, be, reasonable, to, suppose, that, life, would, have, started, just, by, blind, chance, then, there, must, be, a, god, and, such, a, god, would, probably, be, showing, his, influence, in, the, quantum, jumps, which, are, taking, place, later, on, on, the, other, hand, if, life, can, start, very, easily, and, does, not, need, any, divine, influence, then, i, will, say, that, there, is, no, god, dirac, did, not, commit, himself, to, any, definite, view, but, he, described, the, possibilities, for, scientifically, answering, the, question, of, god, dirac, discovered, the, relativistic, equation, for, the, electron, which, now, bears, his, name, the, remarkable, notion, of, an, antiparticle, to, each, fermion, particle, e, g, the, positron, as, antiparticle, to, the, electron, stems, from, his, equation, he, was, the, first, to, develop, quantum, field, theory, which, underlies, all, theoretical, work, on, sub, atomic, or, elementary, particles, today, work, that, is, fundamental, to, our, understanding, of, the, forces, of, nature, he, proposed, and, investigated, the, concept, of, a, magnetic, monopole, an, object, not, yet, known, empirically, as, a, means, of, bringing, even, greater, symmetry, to, james, clerk, maxwell, s, equations, of, electromagnetism, he, is, credited, as, being, the, one, to, create, quantum, field, theory, alongside, creating, quantum, electrodynamics, and, coining, the, term, dirac, also, coined, the, terms, fermion, and, boson, throughout, his, career, dirac, was, motivated, by, the, principles, of, mathematical, beauty, with, peter, goddard, stating, that, dirac, cited, mathematical, beauty, as, the, ultimate, criterion, for, selecting, the, way, forward, in, theoretical, physics, dirac, was, recognised, for, being, mathematically, gifted, as, during, his, time, in, university, academics, had, affirmed, that, dirac, had, an, ability, of, the, highest, order, in, mathematical, physics, with, ebenezer, cunningham, stating, that, dirac, was, quite, the, most, original, student, i, have, met, in, the, subject, of, mathematical, physics, therefore, dirac, was, known, for, his, astounding, physical, intuition, combined, with, the, ability, to, invent, new, mathematics, to, create, new, physics, during, his, career, dirac, made, numerous, important, contributions, to, mathematical, subjects, including, the, dirac, delta, function, dirac, algebra, and, the, dirac, operator, dirac, s, first, step, into, a, new, quantum, theory, was, taken, late, in, september, 1925, ralph, fowler, his, research, supervisor, had, received, a, proof, copy, of, an, exploratory, paper, by, werner, heisenberg, in, the, framework, of, the, old, quantum, theory, of, bohr, and, sommerfeld, heisenberg, leaned, heavily, on, bohr, s, correspondence, principle, but, changed, the, equations, so, that, they, involved, directly, observable, quantities, leading, to, the, matrix, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, fowler, sent, heisenberg, s, paper, on, to, dirac, who, was, on, vacation, in, bristol, asking, him, to, look, into, this, paper, carefully, dirac, s, attention, was, drawn, to, a, mysterious, mathematical, relationship, at, first, sight, unintelligible, that, heisenberg, had, established, several, weeks, later, back, in, cambridge, dirac, suddenly, recognised, that, this, mathematical, form, had, the, same, structure, as, the, poisson, brackets, that, occur, in, the, classical, dynamics, of, particle, motion, at, the, time, his, memory, of, poisson, brackets, was, rather, vague, but, he, found, e, t, whittaker, s, analytical, dynamics, of, particles, and, rigid, bodies, illuminating, from, his, new, understanding, he, developed, a, quantum, theory, based, on, non, commuting, dynamical, variables, this, led, him, to, the, most, profound, and, significant, general, formulation, of, quantum, mechanics, to, date, his, novel, formulation, using, dirac, brackets, allowed, him, to, obtain, the, quantisation, rules, in, a, novel, and, more, illuminating, manner, for, this, work, published, in, 1926, dirac, received, a, phd, from, cambridge, this, formed, the, basis, for, fermi, dirac, statistics, that, applies, to, systems, consisting, of, many, identical, spin, 1, 2, particles, i, e, that, obey, the, pauli, exclusion, principle, e, g, electrons, in, solids, and, liquids, and, importantly, to, the, field, of, conduction, in, semi, conductors, dirac, was, famously, not, bothered, by, issues, of, interpretation, in, quantum, theory, in, fact, in, a, paper, published, in, a, book, in, his, honour, he, wrote, the, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, has, been, dealt, with, by, many, authors, and, i, do, not, want, to, discuss, it, here, i, want, to, deal, with, more, fundamental, things, however, in, 1964, he, wrote, a, short, article, about, the, interpretation, of, quantum, field, theory, when, based, on, the, heisenberg, picture, of, quantum, theory, his, primary, point, in, the, article, was, that, the, schr, dinger, model, does, not, work, for, this, purpose, in, 1928, building, on, 2, 2, spin, matrices, which, he, purported, to, have, discovered, independently, of, wolfgang, pauli, s, work, on, non, relativistic, spin, systems, dirac, told, abraham, pais, i, believe, i, got, these, independently, of, pauli, and, possibly, pauli, got, these, independently, of, me, he, proposed, the, dirac, equation, as, a, relativistic, equation, of, motion, for, the, wave, function, of, the, electron, this, work, led, dirac, to, predict, the, existence, of, the, positron, the, electron, s, antiparticle, which, he, interpreted, in, terms, of, what, came, to, be, called, the, dirac, sea, the, positron, was, observed, by, carl, anderson, in, 1932, dirac, s, equation, also, contributed, to, explaining, the, origin, of, quantum, spin, as, a, relativistic, phenomenon, the, necessity, of, fermions, matter, being, created, and, destroyed, in, enrico, fermi, s, 1934, theory, of, beta, decay, led, to, a, reinterpretation, of, dirac, s, equation, as, a, classical, field, equation, for, any, point, particle, of, spin, 2, itself, subject, to, quantisation, conditions, involving, anti, commutators, thus, reinterpreted, in, 1934, by, werner, heisenberg, as, a, quantum, field, equation, accurately, describing, all, elementary, matter, particles, today, quarks, and, leptons, this, dirac, field, equation, is, as, central, to, theoretical, physics, as, the, maxwell, yang, mills, and, einstein, field, equations, dirac, is, regarded, as, the, founder, of, quantum, electrodynamics, being, the, first, to, use, that, term, he, also, introduced, the, idea, of, vacuum, polarisation, in, the, early, 1930s, this, work, was, key, to, the, development, of, quantum, mechanics, by, the, next, generation, of, theorists, in, particular, schwinger, feynman, sin, itiro, tomonaga, and, dyson, in, their, formulation, of, quantum, electrodynamics, dirac, s, the, principles, of, quantum, mechanics, published, in, 1930, is, a, landmark, in, the, history, of, science, it, quickly, became, one, of, the, standard, textbooks, on, the, subject, and, is, still, used, today, in, that, book, dirac, incorporated, the, previous, work, of, werner, heisenberg, on, matrix, mechanics, and, of, erwin, schr, dinger, on, wave, mechanics, into, a, single, mathematical, formalism, that, associates, measurable, quantities, to, operators, acting, on, the, hilbert, space, of, vectors, that, describe, the, state, of, a, physical, system, the, book, also, introduced, the, dirac, delta, function, following, his, 1939, article, he, also, included, the, bra, ket, notation, in, the, third, edition, of, his, book, thereby, contributing, to, its, universal, use, nowadays, in, 1931, dirac, proposed, that, the, existence, of, a, single, magnetic, monopole, in, the, universe, would, suffice, to, explain, the, quantisation, of, electrical, charge, no, such, monopole, has, been, detected, despite, numerous, attempts, and, preliminary, claims, see, also, searches, for, magnetic, monopoles, dirac, quantised, the, gravitational, field, his, work, laid, the, foundations, for, canonical, quantum, gravity, in, his, 1959, lecture, at, the, lindau, meetings, dirac, discussed, why, gravitational, waves, have, physical, significance, dirac, predicted, gravitational, waves, would, have, well, defined, energy, density, in, 1964, dirac, reintroduced, the, term, graviton, in, a, number, of, lectures, in, 1959, noting, that, the, energy, of, the, gravitational, field, should, come, in, quanta, dirac, is, seen, as, having, anticipated, string, theory, with, his, work, on, the, dirac, membrane, and, dirac, born, infeld, action, both, of, which, he, proposed, in, a, 1962, paper, along, with, other, contributions, he, also, developed, a, general, theory, of, the, quantum, field, with, dynamical, constraints, which, forms, the, basis, of, the, gauge, theories, and, superstring, theories, of, today, shortly, after, wolfgang, pauli, proposed, his, pauli, exclusion, principle, that, two, electrons, cannot, occupy, the, same, quantum, energy, level, enrico, fermi, and, dirac, both, realized, the, principle, would, dramatically, alter, the, statistical, mechanics, of, electron, systems, this, work, became, the, basis, for, fermi, dirac, statistics, 488, dirac, wrote, an, influential, paper, in, 1933, regarding, the, lagrangian, in, quantum, mechanics, the, paper, served, as, the, basis, for, julian, schwinger, and, his, quantum, action, principle, and, laid, the, foundations, for, richard, feynman, s, development, of, a, completely, new, approach, to, quantum, mechanics, the, path, integral, formulation, in, a, 1963, paper, dirac, initiated, the, study, of, field, theory, on, anti, de, sitter, space, ads, the, paper, contains, the, mathematics, of, combining, special, relativity, with, the, quantum, mechanics, of, quarks, inside, hadrons, and, lays, the, foundations, of, two, mode, squeezed, states, that, are, essential, to, modern, quantum, optics, though, dirac, did, not, realize, it, at, the, time, dirac, previously, worked, on, ads, during, the, 1930s, publishing, a, paper, in, 1935, in, 1930, victor, weisskopf, and, eugene, wigner, published, their, famous, and, now, standard, calculation, of, spontaneous, radiation, emission, in, atomic, and, molecular, physics, remarkably, in, a, letter, to, niels, bohr, in, february, 1927, dirac, had, come, to, the, same, calculation, but, he, did, not, publish, it, in, 1938, dirac, renormalized, the, mass, in, the, theory, of, abraham, lorentz, electron, leading, to, the, abraham, lorentz, dirac, force, which, is, the, relativistic, classical, electron, model, however, this, model, has, solutions, that, suggest, force, increase, exponentially, with, time, fermi, s, golden, rule, the, formula, for, computing, quantum, transitions, in, time, dependent, systems, declared, a, golden, rule, by, enrico, fermi, was, derived, by, dirac, dirac, was, the, one, to, initiate, the, development, of, time, dependent, perturbation, theory, in, his, early, work, on, semi, classical, atoms, interacting, with, an, electromagnetic, field, dirac, with, werner, heisenberg, john, archibald, wheeler, richard, feynman, and, freeman, dyson, ultimately, developed, this, concept, into, an, invaluable, tool, for, modern, physics, used, in, the, calculation, of, the, properties, of, any, physical, system, and, a, wide, array, of, phenomena, dirac, was, the, lucasian, professor, of, mathematics, at, the, university, of, cambridge, from, 1932, to, 1969, he, conceived, the, helikon, vortex, isotope, separation, process, in, 1934, in, 1937, he, proposed, a, speculative, cosmological, model, based, on, the, large, numbers, hypothesis, during, world, war, ii, he, conducted, important, theoretical, work, on, uranium, enrichment, by, gas, centrifuge, he, introduced, the, separative, work, unit, swu, in, 1941, he, contributed, to, the, tube, alloys, project, the, british, programme, to, research, and, construct, atomic, bombs, during, world, war, ii, dirac, s, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, included, terms, with, infinite, self, energy, a, workaround, known, as, renormalisation, was, developed, but, dirac, never, accepted, this, i, must, say, that, i, am, very, dissatisfied, with, the, situation, he, said, in, 1975, because, this, so, called, good, theory, does, involve, neglecting, infinities, which, appear, in, its, equations, neglecting, them, in, an, arbitrary, way, this, is, just, not, sensible, mathematics, sensible, mathematics, involves, neglecting, a, quantity, when, it, is, small, not, neglecting, it, just, because, it, is, infinitely, great, and, you, do, not, want, it, his, refusal, to, accept, renormalisation, resulted, in, his, work, on, the, subject, moving, increasingly, out, of, the, mainstream, shin, ichir, tomonaga, schwinger, and, feynman, mastered, this, approach, producing, a, qed, with, unprecedented, accuracy, resulting, formal, recognition, by, an, award, of, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, the, 1950s, in, his, search, for, a, better, qed, paul, dirac, developed, the, hamiltonian, theory, of, constraints, based, on, lectures, that, he, delivered, at, the, 1949, international, mathematical, congress, in, canada, dirac, had, also, solved, the, problem, of, putting, the, schwinger, tomonaga, equation, into, the, schr, dinger, representation, and, given, explicit, expressions, for, the, scalar, meson, field, spin, zero, pion, or, pseudoscalar, meson, the, vector, meson, field, spin, one, rho, meson, and, the, electromagnetic, field, spin, one, massless, boson, photon, the, hamiltonian, of, constrained, systems, is, one, of, dirac, s, many, masterpieces, it, is, a, powerful, generalisation, of, hamiltonian, theory, that, remains, valid, for, curved, spacetime, the, equations, for, the, hamiltonian, involve, only, six, degrees, of, freedom, described, by, g, r, s, displaystyle, g, rs, p, r, s, displaystyle, p, rs, for, each, point, of, the, surface, on, which, the, state, is, considered, the, g, m, 0, displaystyle, g, m0, m, 0, 1, 2, 3, appear, in, the, theory, only, through, the, variables, g, r, 0, displaystyle, g, r0, g, 00, 1, 2, displaystyle, g, 00, 1, 2, which, occur, as, arbitrary, coefficients, in, the, equations, of, motion, there, are, four, constraints, or, weak, equations, for, each, point, of, the, surface, x, 0, displaystyle, x, 0, constant, three, of, them, h, r, displaystyle, h, r, form, the, four, vector, density, in, the, surface, the, fourth, h, l, displaystyle, h, l, is, a, 3, dimensional, scalar, density, in, the, surface, h, l, 0, h, r, 0, r, 1, 2, 3, in, the, late, 1950s, he, applied, the, hamiltonian, methods, he, had, developed, to, cast, einstein, s, general, relativity, in, hamiltonian, form, and, to, bring, to, a, technical, completion, the, quantisation, problem, of, gravitation, and, bring, it, also, closer, to, the, rest, of, physics, according, to, salam, and, dewitt, in, 1959, he, also, gave, an, invited, talk, on, energy, of, the, gravitational, field, at, the, new, york, meeting, of, the, american, physical, society, in, 1964, he, published, his, lectures, on, quantum, mechanics, london, academic, which, deals, with, constrained, dynamics, of, nonlinear, dynamical, systems, including, quantisation, of, curved, spacetime, he, also, published, a, paper, entitled, quantization, of, the, gravitational, field, in, the, 1967, ictp, iaea, trieste, symposium, on, contemporary, physics, the, 1963, 1964, lectures, dirac, gave, on, quantum, field, theory, at, yeshiva, university, were, published, in, 1966, as, the, belfer, graduate, school, of, science, monograph, series, number, 3, in, 1969, dirac, was, forced, to, retire, from, his, chair, at, cambridge, due, to, his, age, 67, before, his, retirement, he, was, offered, a, visiting, position, at, the, university, of, miami, in, coral, gables, florida, he, accepted, joining, its, newly, formed, center, for, theoretical, studies, in, september, 1970, he, also, accepted, a, visiting, professor, position, at, florida, state, university, in, tallahassee, florida, and, moved, his, family, to, tallahassee, he, accepted, a, position, at, fsu, as, a, full, professor, in, 1972, contemporary, accounts, of, his, time, in, tallahassee, describe, it, as, happy, except, that, he, apparently, found, the, summer, heat, oppressive, and, liked, to, escape, from, it, to, cambridge, he, would, walk, about, a, mile, to, work, each, day, and, was, fond, of, swimming, in, one, of, the, two, nearby, lakes, silver, lake, and, lost, lake, and, was, also, more, sociable, than, he, had, been, at, the, university, of, cambridge, where, he, mostly, worked, at, home, apart, from, giving, classes, and, seminars, at, florida, state, he, would, usually, eat, lunch, with, his, colleagues, before, taking, a, nap, dirac, published, over, 60, papers, at, fsu, during, those, last, twelve, years, of, his, life, including, a, short, book, on, general, relativity, his, last, paper, 1984, entitled, the, inadequacies, of, quantum, field, theory, contains, his, final, judgment, on, quantum, field, theory, these, rules, of, renormalisation, give, surprisingly, excessively, good, agreement, with, experiments, most, physicists, say, that, these, working, rules, are, therefore, correct, i, feel, that, is, not, an, adequate, reason, just, because, the, results, happen, to, be, in, agreement, with, observation, does, not, prove, that, one, s, theory, is, correct, the, paper, ends, with, the, words, i, have, spent, many, years, searching, for, a, hamiltonian, to, bring, into, the, theory, and, have, not, yet, found, it, i, shall, continue, to, work, on, it, as, long, as, i, can, and, other, people, i, hope, will, follow, along, such, lines, amongst, his, many, students, were, homi, j, bhabha, fred, hoyle, john, polkinghorne, and, freeman, dyson, polkinghorne, recalls, that, dirac, was, once, asked, what, was, his, fundamental, belief, he, strode, to, a, blackboard, and, wrote, that, the, laws, of, nature, should, be, expressed, in, beautiful, equations, dirac, shared, the, 1933, nobel, prize, for, physics, with, erwin, schr, dinger, for, the, discovery, of, new, productive, forms, of, atomic, theory, dirac, was, also, awarded, the, royal, medal, in, 1939, and, both, the, copley, medal, and, the, max, planck, medal, in, 1952, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1930, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1938, an, honorary, fellow, of, the, american, physical, society, in, 1948, a, member, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1949, a, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1950, and, an, honorary, fellow, of, the, institute, of, physics, london, in, 1971, he, received, the, inaugural, j, robert, oppenheimer, memorial, prize, in, 1969, dirac, became, a, member, of, the, order, of, merit, in, 1973, having, previously, turned, down, a, knighthood, as, he, did, not, want, to, be, addressed, by, his, first, name, in, 1984, dirac, died, in, tallahassee, florida, and, was, buried, at, tallahassee, s, roselawn, cemetery, dirac, s, childhood, home, in, bishopston, bristol, is, commemorated, with, a, blue, plaque, and, the, nearby, dirac, road, is, named, in, recognition, of, his, links, with, the, city, of, bristol, a, commemorative, stone, was, erected, in, a, garden, in, saint, maurice, switzerland, the, town, of, origin, of, his, father, s, family, on, 1, august, 1991, on, 13, november, 1995, a, commemorative, marker, made, from, burlington, green, slate, and, inscribed, with, the, dirac, equation, was, unveiled, in, westminster, abbey, the, dean, of, westminster, edward, carpenter, had, initially, refused, permission, for, the, memorial, thinking, dirac, to, be, anti, christian, but, was, eventually, over, a, five, year, period, persuaded, to, relent, the, influence, and, importance, of, dirac, s, work, have, increased, with, the, decades, and, physicists, use, daily, the, concepts, and, equations, that, he, developed, in, 1975, dirac, gave, a, series, of, five, lectures, at, the, university, of, new, south, wales, which, were, subsequently, published, as, a, book, directions, in, physics, 1978, he, donated, the, royalties, from, this, book, to, the, university, for, the, establishment, of, dirac, lecture, series, the, silver, dirac, medal, for, the, advancement, of, theoretical, physics, is, awarded, by, the, university, of, new, south, wales, to, commemorate, the, lecture, immediately, after, his, death, two, organisations, of,
