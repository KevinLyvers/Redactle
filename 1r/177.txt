a, parallel, experimental, effort, he, joined, his, avant, garde, peers, in, the, long, running, search, for, a, new, style, that, would, be, suitable, for, the, modern, industrial, age, the, weak, points, of, traditional, styles, had, been, under, attack, by, progressive, theorists, since, the, mid, nineteenth, century, primarily, for, the, contradictions, of, hiding, modern, construction, technology, with, a, facade, of, ornamented, traditional, styles, the, mounting, criticism, of, the, historical, styles, gained, substantial, cultural, credibility, after, world, war, i, a, disaster, widely, seen, as, a, failure, of, the, old, world, order, of, imperial, leadership, of, europe, the, aristocratic, classical, revival, styles, were, particularly, reviled, by, many, as, the, architectural, symbol, of, a, now, discredited, and, outmoded, social, system, progressive, thinkers, called, for, a, completely, new, architectural, design, process, guided, by, rational, problem, solving, and, an, exterior, expression, of, modern, materials, and, structure, rather, than, what, they, considered, the, superficial, application, of, classical, facades, while, continuing, his, traditional, neoclassical, design, practice, mies, began, to, develop, visionary, projects, that, though, mostly, unbuilt, rocketed, him, to, fame, as, an, architect, capable, of, giving, form, that, was, in, harmony, with, the, spirit, of, the, emerging, modern, society, boldly, abandoning, ornament, altogether, mies, made, a, dramatic, modernist, debut, in, 1921, with, his, stunning, competition, proposal, for, the, faceted, all, glass, friedrichstra, e, skyscraper, followed, by, a, taller, curved, version, in, 1922, named, the, glass, skyscraper, he, constructed, his, first, modernist, house, with, the, villa, wolf, in, 1926, in, guben, today, gubin, poland, for, erich, and, elisabeth, wolf, this, was, shortly, followed, by, haus, lange, and, haus, esters, in, 1928, he, continued, with, a, series, of, pioneering, projects, culminating, in, his, two, european, masterworks, the, temporary, german, pavilion, for, the, barcelona, exposition, often, called, the, barcelona, pavilion, in, 1929, a, 1986, reconstruction, is, now, built, on, the, original, site, and, the, elegant, villa, tugendhat, in, brno, czechoslovakia, completed, in, 1930, he, joined, the,

bauhaus, design, school, as, their, director, of, architecture, adopting, and, developing, their, functionalist, application, of, simple, geometric, forms, in, the, design, of, useful, objects, he, served, as, its, last, director, like, many, other, avant, garde, architects, of, the, day, mies, based, his, architectural, mission, and, principles, on, his, understanding, and, interpretation, of, ideas, developed, by, theorists, and, critics, who, pondered, the, declining, relevance, of, the, traditional, design, styles, he, selectively, adopted, theoretical, ideas, such, as, the, aesthetic, credos, of, russian, constructivism, with, their, ideology, of, efficient, sculptural, assembly, of, modern, industrial, materials, mies, found, appeal, in, the, use, of, simple, rectilinear, and, planar, forms, clean, lines, pure, use, of, color, and, the, extension, of, space, around, and, beyond, interior, walls, expounded, by, the, dutch, de, stijl, group, in, particular, the, layering, of, functional, sub, spaces, within, an, overall, space, and, the, distinct, articulation, of, parts, as, expressed, by, gerrit, rietveld, appealed, to, mies, as, households, in, the, middle, class, and, upper, class, could, increasingly, afford, household, appliances, modern, architects, like, mies, le, corbusier, walter, gropius, and, adolf, loos, rejected, decorative, architecture, and, became, drivers, of, a, modern, arts, and, crafts, movement, in, europe, mies, and, le, corbusier, later, acknowledged, the, lasting, impact, frank, lloyd, wright, s, wasmuth, portfolio, had, after, it, was,

it, to, an, abandoned, telephone, factory, in, berlin, in, april, 1933, the, school, was, raided, by, the, gestapo, and, in, july, of, that, year, because, the, nazis, had, made, the, continued, operation, of, the, school, untenable, mies, and, the, faculty, voted, to, close, the, bauhaus, some, of, mies, s, designs, found, favour, with, adolf, hitler, such, as, his, designs, for, autobahn, service, stations, 319, mies, and, gropius, both, joined, the, visual, arts, section, of, the, reich, culture, chamber, and, entered, early, nazi, architectural, competitions, with, designs, showing, structures, decorated, with, swastikas, 340, mies, s, design, for, a, reich, bank, building, in, berlin, was, one, of, six, to, receive, a, prize, although, it, was, rejected, by, hitler, mies, and,

because, it, resembled, a, glass, house, technological, limits, meant, that, mies, s, vision, for, a, skin, and, bones, architecture, where, the, steel, frame, was, exposed, internally, and,
