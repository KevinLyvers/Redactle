georg, simon, ohm, o, m, german, 16, march, 1789, 6, july, 1854, was, a, german, physicist, and, mathematician, as, a, school, teacher, ohm, began, his, research, with, the, new, electrochemical, cell, invented, by, italian, scientist, alessandro, volta, using, equipment, of, his, own, creation, ohm, found, that, there, is, a, direct, proportionality, between, the, potential, difference, voltage, applied, across, a, conductor, and, the, resultant, electric, current, this, relation, is, called, ohm, s, law, and, the, ohm, the, unit, of, electrical, resistance, is, named, after, him, georg, simon, ohm, was, born, into, a, protestant, family, in, erlangen, brandenburg, bayreuth, then, part, of, the, holy, roman, empire, son, to, locksmith, johann, wolfgang, ohm, and, maria, elizabeth, beck, daughter, of, a, tailor, in, erlangen, although, his, parents, had, not, been, formally, educated, ohm, s, father, was, a, respected, man, who, had, educated, himself, to, a, high, level, and, was, able, to, give, his, sons, an, excellent, education, through, his, own, teachings, of, the, seven, children, of, the, family, only, three, survived, to, adulthood, georg, simon, his, younger, brother, martin, who, later, became, a, well, known, mathematician, and, his, sister, elizabeth, barbara, his, mother, died, when, he, was, ten, from, early, childhood, georg, and, martin, were, taught, by, their, father, who, brought, them, to, a, high, standard, in, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and, philosophy, georg, simon, attended, erlangen, gymnasium, from, age, eleven, to, fifteen, where, he, received, little, in, the, area, of, scientific, training, which, sharply, contrasted, with, the, inspired, instruction, that, both, georg, and, martin, received, from, their, father, this, characteristic, made, the, ohms, bear, a, resemblance, to, the, bernoulli, family, as, noted, by, karl, christian, von, langsdorf, a, professor, at, the, university, of, erlangen, georg, ohm, s, father, concerned, that, his, son, was, wasting, his, educational, opportunity, sent, ohm, to, switzerland, there, in, september, 1806, ohm, accepted, a, position, as, a, mathematics, teacher, in, a, school, in, gottstadt, bei, nidau, karl, christian, von, langsdorf, left, the, university, of, erlangen, in, early, 1809, to, take, up, a, post, in, the, university, of, heidelberg, ohm, wanted, to, restart, his, mathematical, studies, with, langsdorf, in, heidelberg, langsdorf, however, advised, ohm, to, pursue, mathematical, studies, on, his, own, and, suggested, that, ohm, read, works, of, euler, laplace, and, lacroix, rather, reluctantly, ohm, took, his, advice, but, he, left, his, teaching, post, in, gottstatt, monastery, in, march, 1809, to, become, a, private, tutor, in, neuch, tel, for, two, years, he, carried, out, his, duties, as, a, tutor, while, he, followed, langsdorf, s, advice, and, continued, his, private, study, of, mathematics, then, in, april, 1811, he, returned, to, the, university, of, erlangen, ohm, s, own, studies, prepared, him, for, his, doctorate, which, he, received, from, the, university, of, erlangen, on, october, 25, 1811, he, immediately, joined, the, faculty, there, as, a, lecturer, in, mathematics, but, left, after, three, semesters, because, of, unpromising, prospects, he, could, not, survive, on, his, salary, as, a, lecturer, the, bavarian, government, offered, him, a, post, as, a, teacher, of, mathematics, and, physics, at, a, poor, quality, school, in, bamberg, which, ohm, accepted, in, january, 1813, unhappy, with, his, job, georg, began, writing, an, elementary, textbook, on, geometry, as, a, way, to, prove, his, abilities, that, school, was, closed, in, february, 1816, the, bavarian, government, then, sent, ohm, to, an, overcrowded, school, in, bamberg, to, help, out, with, the, teaching, of, mathematics, after, his, assignment, in, bamberg, ohm, sent, his, completed, manuscript, to, king, wilhelm, iii, of, prussia, the, king, was, satisfied, with, ohm, s, book, and, offered, ohm, a, position, at, the, jesuit, gymnasium, of, cologne, on, 11, september, 1817, this, school, had, a, reputation, for, good, science, education, and, ohm, was, required, to, teach, physics, in, addition, to, mathematics, the, physics, laboratory, was, well, equipped, allowing, ohm, to, begin, experiments, in, physics, as, the, son, of, a, locksmith, ohm, had, some, practical, experience, with, mechanical, devices, ohm, published, die, galvanische, kette, mathematisch, bearbeitet, the, galvanic, circuit, investigated, mathematically, in, 1827, ohm, s, college, did, not, appreciate, his, work, and, ohm, resigned, from, his, position, he, then, made, an, application, to, and, was, employed, by, the, polytechnic, school, of, nuremberg, ohm, arrived, at, the, polytechnic, school, of, nuremberg, in, 1833, and, in, 1852, he, became, a, professor, of, experimental, physics, at, the, university, of, munich, in, 1849, ohm, published, beitr, ge, zur, molecular, physik, molecular, physics, in, the, preface, of, this, work, he, stated, he, hoped, to, write, a, second, and, third, volume, and, if, god, gives, me, length, of, days, for, it, a, fourth, however, on, finding, that, an, original, discovery, recorded, in, it, was, being, anticipated, by, a, swedish, scientist, he, did, not, publish, it, stating, the, episode, has, given, a, fresh, and, deep, sense, for, my, mind, to, the, saying, man, proposes, and, god, disposes, the, project, that, gave, the, first, impetus, to, my, inquiry, has, been, dissipated, into, mist, and, a, new, one, undesigned, by, me, has, been, accomplished, in, its, place, ohm, died, in, munich, in, 1854, and, is, buried, in, the, alter, s, dfriedhof, a, collection, of, his, family, letters, would, be, compiled, in, a, german, book, which, shows, that, he, used, to, sign, some, of, his, letters, with, the, expression, gott, befohlen, g, s, ohm, meaning, commended, to, god, ohm, s, law, first, appeared, in, the, famous, book, die, galvanische, kette, mathematisch, bearbeitet, the, galvanic, circuit, investigated, mathematically, 1827, in, which, he, gave, his, complete, theory, of, electricity, in, this, work, he, stated, his, law, for, electromotive, force, acting, between, the, extremities, of, any, part, of, a, circuit, is, the, product, of, the, strength, of, the, current, and, the, resistance, of, that, part, of, the, circuit, the, book, begins, with, the, mathematical, background, necessary, for, an, understanding, of, the, rest, of, the, work, while, his, work, greatly, influenced, the, theory, and, applications, of, current, electricity, it, was, coldly, received, at, that, time, ohm, presents, his, theory, as, one, of, contiguous, action, a, theory, which, opposed, the, concept, of, action, at, a, distance, ohm, believed, that, the, communication, of, electricity, occurred, between, contiguous, particles, which, is, the, term, he, himself, used, the, paper, is, concerned, with, this, idea, and, in, particular, with, illustrating, the, differences, in, this, scientific, approach, of, ohm, s, and, the, approaches, of, joseph, fourier, and, claude, louis, navier, a, study, of, the, conceptual, framework, used, by, ohm, in, producing, ohm, s, law, has, been, presented, by, thomas, archibald, the, work, of, ohm, marked, the, early, beginning, of, the, subject, of, circuit, theory, although, this, did, not, become, an, important, field, until, the, end, of, the, century, ohm, s, acoustic, law, sometimes, called, the, acoustic, phase, law, or, simply, ohm, s, law, states, that, a, musical, sound, is, perceived, by, the, ear, as, a, set, of, a, number, of, constituent, pure, harmonic, tones, it, is, well, known, to, be, not, quite, true, his, first, paper, in, 1825, examined, the, decrease, in, the, electromagnetic, force, produced, by, a, wire, as, the, length, of, the, wire, increased, in, 1826, he, gave, a, description, of, conduction, in, circuits, modelled, on, fourier, s, study, of, heat, conduction, this, paper, continued, ohm, s, deduction, of, results, from, experimental, evidence, and, particularly, in, the, second, he, was, able, to, propose, laws, which, went, a, long, way, to, explaining, results, of, others, working, on, galvanic, electricity, the, most, important, was, his, pamphlet, published, in, berlin, in, 1827, with, the, title, die, galvanische, kette, mathematisch, bearbeitet, this, work, the, germ, of, which, had, appeared, during, the, two, preceding, years, in, the, journals, of, schweigger, and, poggendorff, has, exerted, an, important, influence, on, the, development, of, the, theory, and, applications, of, electric, current, ohm, s, name, has, been, incorporated, in, the, terminology, of, electrical, science, in, ohm, s, law, which, he, first, published, in, die, galvanische, kette, the, proportionality, of, current, and, voltage, in, a, resistor, and, adopted, as, the, si, unit, of, resistance, the, ohm, symbol, although, ohm, s, work, strongly, influenced, theory, at, first, it, was, received, with, little, enthusiasm, however, his, work, was, eventually, recognized, by, the, royal, society, with, its, award, of, the, copley, medal, in, 1841, he, became, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, in, 1842, and, in, 1845, he, became, a, full, member, of, the, bavarian, academy, of, sciences, and, humanities, at, some, extent, charles, wheatstone, drew, attention, to, the, definitions, which, ohm, had, introduced, in, the, field, of, physics
