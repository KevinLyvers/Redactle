sarah, elmira, royster, before, he, registered, at, the, university, of, virginia, in, february, 1826, to, study, ancient, and, modern, languages, the, university, was, in, its, infancy, established, on, the, ideals, of, its, founder, thomas, jefferson, it, had, strict, rules, against, gambling, horses, guns, tobacco, and, alcohol, but, these, rules, were, mostly, ignored, jefferson, enacted, a, system, of, student, self, government, allowing, students, to, choose, their, own, studies, make, their, own, arrangements, for, boarding, and, report, all, wrongdoing, to, the, faculty, the, unique,

harbor, for, five, dollars, a, month, however, that, same, year, his, first, book, was, published, a, 40, page, collection, of, poetry, titled, tamerlane, and, other, poems, attributed, only, to, a, bostonian, 50, copies, were, printed, and, the, book, received, virtually, no, attention, poe, s, regiment, was, posted, to, fort, moultrie, in, charleston, south, carolina, before, embarking, on,

early, poe, revealed, his, real, name, and, his, actual, circumstances, to, his, commanding, officer, lieutenant, howard, who, promised, to, allow, poe, to, be, honorably, discharged, if, he, reconciled, with, allan, poe, then, wrote, a, letter, to, allan, who, was, unsympathetic, and, spent, several, months, ignoring, poe, s, pleas, allan, may, not, have, written, to, poe, to, inform, him, of, his, foster, mother, s, illness, frances, allan, died, on, february, 28, 1829, poe, visited, the, day, after, her, burial, perhaps, softened, by, his, wife, s, death, allan, agreed, to, support, poe, s, desire, to, receive, an, appointment, to, the, united, states, military, academy, at, west, point, new, york, poe, was, finally, discharged, on, april, 15, 1829, after, securing, a, replacement, to, finish, his, enlistment, before, entering, west, point, he, moved, to, baltimore, where, he, stayed, with, his, widowed, aunt, maria, clemm, her, daughter, virginia, eliza, clemm, poe, s, first, cousin, his, brother, henry, and, his, invalid, grandmother, elizabeth, cairnes, poe, in, september, of, that, year, poe, received, the, very, first, words, of, encouragement, i, ever, remember, to, have, heard, in, a, review, of, his, poetry, by, influential, critic, john, neal, which, prompted, poe, to, dedicate, one, of, the, poems, to, neal, in, his, second, book, al, aaraaf, tamerlane, and, minor, poems, published, in, baltimore, in, 1829, poe, traveled, to, west, point, and, matriculated, as, a, cadet, on, july, 1, 1830, in, october, 1830, allan, married, his, second, wife, louisa, patterson, this, marriage, and, the, bitter, quarrels, with, poe, over, children, born, to, allan, out, of, extramarital, affairs, led, to, the, foster, father, finally, disowning, poe, poe, then, decided, to, leave, west, point, by, intentionally, getting, court, martialed, on, february, 8, 1831, he, was, tried, for, gross, neglect, of, duty, and, disobedience, of, orders, for, refusing, to, attend, formations, classes, and, church, knowing, he, would, be, found, guilty, poe, pleaded, not, guilty, to, the, charges, in, order, to, induce, dismissal, poe, left, for, new, york, in, february, 1831, and, then, released, a, third, volume, of, poems, simply, titled, poems, the, book, was, financed, with, help, from, his, fellow, cadets, at, west, point, some, of, whom, donated, as, much, as, 75, cents, to, the, cause, the, total, raised, was, approximately, 170, they, may, have, been, expecting, verses, similar, to, the, satirical, ones, poe, had, written, about, commanding, officers, in, the, past, the, book, was, printed, by, elam, bliss, of, new, york, labeled, as, second, edition, and, included, a, page, saying, to, the, u, s, corps, of, cadets, this, volume, is, respectfully, dedicated, it, once, again, reprinted, the, somewhat, lengthy, poems, tamerlane, and, al, araaf, while, also, including, six, previously, unpublished, poems, conspicuous, among, which, are, to, helen, and, the, city, in, the, sea, poe, returned, to, baltimore, and, to, his, aunt, brother, and, cousin, in, march, 1831, his, elder, brother, henry, had, been, seriously, ill, for, some, time, in, part, due, to, complications, resulting, from, alcoholism, and, he, died, on, august, 1, 1831, after, his, brother, s, death, poe, s, earnest, attempts, to, make, a, living, as, a, writer, were, mostly, unsuccessful, however, by, dint, of, stubborn, perseverance, he, was, eventually, enabled, to, earn, a, living, by, his, pen, alone, becoming, one, of, the, first, american, authors, to, do, so, his, efforts, were, initially, hampered, by, the, lack, of, an, international, copyright, law, american, publishers, often, chose, to, sell, unauthorized, copies, of, works, by, british, authors, rather, than, pay, for, new, work, written, by, americans, regardless, of, merit, the, initially, anemic, reception, of, edgar, allan, poe, s, work, may, also, have, been, influenced, by, the, panic, of, 1837, there, was, a, booming, growth, in, american, periodicals, around, this, time, fueled, in, part, by, new, technology, but, many, did, not, last, beyond, a, few, issues, publishers, often, refused, to, pay, their, writers, or, paid, them, much, later, than, they, promised, and, poe, repeatedly, resorted, to, humiliating, pleas, for, money, and, other, assistance, after, his, early, attempts, at, poetry, poe, turned, his, attention, to, prose, perhaps, based, on, john, neal, s, critiques, in, the, yankee, magazine, he, placed, a, few, stories, with, a, philadelphia, publication, and, began, work, on, his, only, drama, politian, the, baltimore, saturday, visiter, awarded, him, a, prize, in, october, 1833, for, his, often, overlooked, short, story, ms, found, in, a, bottle, the, tale, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, john, p, kennedy, a, baltimorean, of, considerable, means, who, helped, poe, place, some, of, his, other, stories, and, introduced, him, to, thomas, w, white, editor, of, the, southern, literary, messenger, in, richmond, in, 1835, poe, became, assistant, editor, of, the, southern, literary, messenger, but, white, discharged, him, within, a, few, weeks, allegedly, for, being, drunk, on, the, job, poe, then, returned, to, baltimore, where, he, obtained, a, license, to, marry, his, cousin, virginia, on, september, 22, 1835, though, it, is, unknown, if, they, were, actually, married, at, that, time, he, was, 26, and, she, was, only, 13, poe, was, reinstated, by, white, after, promising, to, improve, his, behavior, and, he, returned, to, richmond, with, virginia, and, her, mother, he, remained, at, the, messenger, until, january, 1837, during, this, period, poe, claimed, that, its, circulation, increased, from, 700, to, 3, 500, he, published, several, poems, and, many, book, reviews, critiques, essays, and, articles, as, well, as, a, few, stories, in, the, paper, on, may, 16, 1836, he, and, virginia, were, officially, married, at, a, presbyterian, wedding, ceremony, performed, by, amasa, converse, at, their, richmond, boarding, house, with, a, witness, falsely, attesting, clemm, s, age, as, 21, in, 1838, poe, relocated, to, philadelphia, where, he, lived, at, four, different, residences, between, 1838, and, 1844, one, of, which, at, 532, n, 7th, street, has, been, preserved, as, a, national, historic, landmark, that, same, year, poe, s, only, novel, the, narrative, of, arthur, gordon, pym, of, nantucket, was, published, and, widely, reviewed, in, the, summer, of, 1839, he, became, assistant, editor, of, burton, s, gentleman, s, magazine, he, published, numerous, articles, stories, and, reviews, enhancing, the, reputation, he, had, established, at, the, messenger, as, one, of, america, s, foremost, literary, critics, also, in, 1839, the, collection, tales, of, the, grotesque, and, arabesque, was, published, in, two, volumes, though, poe, received, little, remuneration, from, it, and, the, volumes, received, generally, mixed, reviews, in, june, 1840, poe, published, a, prospectus, announcing, his, intentions, to, start, his, own, journal, called, the, stylus, although, he, originally, intended, to, call, it, the, penn, since, it, would, have, been, based, in, philadelphia, he, bought, advertising, space, for, the, prospectus, in, the, june, 6, 1840, issue, of, philadelphia, s, saturday, evening, post, prospectus, of, the, penn, magazine, a, monthly, literary, journal, to, be, edited, and, published, in, the, city, of, philadelphia, by, edgar, a, poe, however, poe, died, before, the, journal, could, be, produced, poe, left, burton, s, after, a, year, and, found, a, position, as, writer, and, co, editor, at, graham, s, magazine, which, was, a, successful, monthly, publication, in, the, last, number, of, graham, s, for, 1841, poe, was, among, the, co, signatories, to, an, editorial, note, of, celebration, concerning, the, tremendous, success, the, magazine, had, achieved, in, the, past, year, perhaps, the, editors, of, no, magazine, either, in, america, or, in, europe, ever, sat, down, at, the, close, of, a, year, to, contemplate, the, progress, of, their, work, with, more, satisfaction, than, we, do, now, our, success, has, been, unexampled, almost, incredible, we, may, assert, without, fear, of, contradiction, that, no, periodical, ever, witnessed, the, same, increase, during, so, short, a, period, around, this, time, poe, attempted, to, secure, a, position, in, the, administration, of, john, tyler, claiming, that, he, was, a, member, of, the, whig, party, he, hoped, to, be, appointed, to, the, united, states, custom, house, in, philadelphia, with, help, from, president, tyler, s, son, robert, an, acquaintance, of, poe, s, friend, frederick, thomas, however, poe, failed, to, appear, for, a, meeting, with, thomas, to, discuss, the, appointment, in, mid, september, of, 1842, claiming, to, have, been, sick, though, thomas, believed, that, he, had, been, drunk, poe, was, promised, an, appointment, but, all, positions, were, eventually, filled, by, others, one, evening, in, january, 1842, virginia, showed, the, first, signs, of, consumption, or, tuberculosis, while, singing, and, playing, the, piano, which, poe, described, as, the, breaking, of, a, blood, vessel, in, her, throat, she, only, partially, recovered, and, poe, is, alleged, to, have, begun, to, drink, heavily, due, to, the, stress, he, suffered, as, a, result, of, her, illness, he, then, left, graham, s, and, attempted, to, find, a, new, position, for, a, time, again, angling, for, a, government, post, he, finally, decided, to, return, to, new, york, where, he, worked, briefly, at, the, evening, mirror, before, becoming, editor, of, the, broadway, journal, and, later, its, owner, there, poe, alienated, himself, from, other, writers, by, among, other, things, publicly, accusing, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, of, plagiarism, though, longfellow, never, responded, poe, later, emended, his, accusations, by, expressing, his, belief, that, many, writers, having, absorbed, ideas, from, others, in, the, past, often, confuse, the, source, of, their, ideas, with, their, original, thoughts, but, most, of, his, contemporaries, found, that, interpretation, incomprehensible, and, continued, to, be, antagonistic, towards, poe, on, january, 29, 1845, poe, s, poem, the, raven, appeared, in, the, evening, mirror, and, quickly, became, a, popular, sensation, it, made, poe, a, household, name, almost, instantly, though, at, the, time, he, was, paid, only, 9, equivalent, to, 294, in, 2023, for, its, publication, it, was, concurrently, published, in, the, american, review, a, whig, journal, under, the, pseudonym, quarles, the, broadway, journal, failed, in, 1846, and, poe, then, moved, to, a, cottage, in, fordham, new, york, in, the, bronx, that, home, now, known, as, the, edgar, allan, poe, cottage, was, relocated, in, later, years, to, a, park, near, the, southeast, corner, of, the, grand, concourse, and, kingsbridge, road, nearby, poe, befriended, the, jesuits, at, st, john, s, college, now, fordham, university, virginia, died, at, the, cottage, on, january, 30, 1847, biographers, and, critics, often, suggest, that, poe, s, frequent, theme, of, the, death, of, a, beautiful, woman, stems, from, the, repeated, loss, of, women, throughout, his, life, including, his, wife, however, as, poe, was, a, prolific, writer, before, virginia, s, death, others, have, suggested, that, this, explanation, of, his, work, is, an, oversimplification, poe, was, increasingly, unstable, after, his, wife, s, death, he, attempted, to, court, the, poet, sarah, helen, whitman, who, lived, in, providence, rhode, island, their, engagement, failed, purportedly, because, of, poe, s, drinking, and, erratic, behavior, there, is, also, strong, evidence, that, whitman, s, mother, intervened, and, did, much, to, derail, the, relationship, poe, then, returned, to, richmond, and, resumed, a, relationship, with, his, childhood, sweetheart, sarah, elmira, royster, on, october, 3, 1849, poe, was, found, semiconscious, in, baltimore, in, great, distress, and, in, need, of, immediate, assistance, according, to, joseph, w, walker, who, found, him, he, was, taken, to, washington, medical, college, where, he, died, on, sunday, october, 7, 1849, at, 5, 00, in, the, morning, poe, was, not, coherent, long, enough, to, explain, how, he, came, to, be, in, his, dire, condition, and, why, he, was, wearing, clothes, that, were, not, his, own, he, is, said, to, have, repeatedly, called, out, the, name, reynolds, on, the, night, before, his, death, though, it, is, unclear, to, whom, he, was, referring, his, attending, physician, said, that, poe, s, final, words, were, lord, help, my, poor, soul, all, of, the, relevant, medical, records, have, been, lost, including, poe, s, death, certificate, newspapers, at, the, time, reported, poe, s, death, as, congestion, of, the, brain, or, cerebral, inflammation, common, euphemisms, for, death, from, disreputable, causes, such, as, alcoholism, the, actual, cause, of, death, remains, a, mystery, speculation, has, included, delirium, tremens, heart, disease, epilepsy, syphilis, meningeal, inflammation, cholera, carbon, monoxide, poisoning, and, rabies, one, theory, dating, from, 1872, suggests, that, poe, s, death, resulted, from, cooping, a, form, of, electoral, fraud, in, which, citizens, were, forced, to, vote, for, a, particular, candidate, sometimes, leading, to, violence, and, even, murder, immediately, after, poe, s, death, his, literary, rival, rufus, wilmot, griswold, wrote, a, slanted, high, profile, obituary, under, a, pseudonym, filled, with, falsehoods, that, cast, poe, as, a, lunatic, and, which, described, him, as, a, person, who, walked, the, streets, in, madness, or, melancholy, with, lips, moving, in, indistinct, curses, or, with, eyes, upturned, in, passionate, prayers, never, for, himself, for, he, felt, or, professed, to, feel, that, he, was, already, damned, the, long, obituary, appeared, in, the, new, york, tribune, signed, ludwig, on, the, day, poe, was, buried, in, baltimore, it, was, further, published, throughout, the, country, the, obituary, began, edgar, allan, poe, is, dead, he, died, in, baltimore, the, day, before, yesterday, this, announcement, will, startle, many, but, few, will, be, grieved, by, it, ludwig, was, soon, identified, as, griswold, an, editor, critic, and, anthologist, who, had, borne, a, grudge, against, poe, since, 1842, griswold, somehow, became, poe, s, literary, executor, and, attempted, to, destroy, his, enemy, s, reputation, after, his, death, griswold, wrote, a, biographical, article, of, poe, called, memoir, of, the, author, which, he, included, in, an, 1850, volume, of, the, collected, works, there, he, depicted, poe, as, a, depraved, drunken, drug, addled, madman, including, some, of, poe, s, letters, as, evidence, many, of, his, claims, were, either, outright, lies, or, obvious, distortions, for, example, there, is, little, to, no, evidence, that, edgar, allan, poe, was, a, drug, addict, griswold, s, book, was, denounced, by, those, who, knew, poe, well, including, john, neal, who, published, an, article, defending, poe, and, attacking, griswold, as, a, rhadamanthus, who, is, not, to, be, bilked, of, his, fee, a, thimble, full, of, newspaper, notoriety, griswold, s, book, nevertheless, became, a, popularly, accepted, biographical, source, this, was, in, part, because, it, was, the, only, full, biography, available, and, was, widely, reprinted, and, in, part, because, readers, thrilled, at, the, thought, of, reading, works, by, an, evil, man, letters, that, griswold, presented, as, proof, were, later, revealed, as, forgeries, poe, s, best, known, fiction, works, have, been, labeled, as, gothic, horror, and, adhere, to, that, genre, s, general, propensity, to, appeal, to, the, public, s, taste, for, the, terrifying, or, psychologically, intimidating, his, most, recurrent, themes, seem, to, deal, with, death, the, physical, signs, indicating, death, the, nature, of, decomposition, the, popular, concerns, of, poe, s, day, about, premature, burial, the, reanimation, of, the, dead, are, all, at, length, explored, in, his, more, notable, works, many, of, his, writings, are, generally, considered, to, be, part, of, the, dark, romanticism, genre, which, is, said, to, be, a, literary, reaction, to, transcendentalism, which, poe, strongly, criticized, he, referred, to, followers, of, the, transcendental, movement, including, emerson, as, frog, pondians, after, the, pond, on, boston, common, and, ridiculed, their, writings, as, metaphor, run, mad, lapsing, into, obscurity, for, obscurity, s, sake, or, mysticism, for, mysticism, s, sake, however, poe, once, wrote, in, a, letter, to, thomas, holley, chivers, that, he, did, not, dislike, transcendentalists, only, the, pretenders, and, sophists, among, them, beyond, the, horror, stories, he, is, most, famous, for, poe, also, wrote, a, number, of, satires, humor, tales, and, hoaxes, he, was, a, master, of, sarcasm, for, comic, effect, he, often, used, irony, and, ludicrous, extravagance, in, a, deliberate, attempt, to, liberate, the, reader, from, cultural, and, literary, conformity, metzengerstein, is, the, first, story, that, poe, is, known, to, have, published, and, his, first, foray, into, horror, but, it, was, originally, intended, as, a, burlesque, satirizing, the, popular, genres, of, poe, s, time, poe, was, also, one, of, the, forerunners, of, american, science, fiction, responding, in, his, voluminous, writing, to, such, emerging, literary, trends, as, the, explorations, into, the, possibilities, of, hot, air, balloons, as, featured, in, such, works, as, the, balloon, hoax, much, of, poe, s, work, coincided, with, themes, that, readers, of, his, day, found, appealing, though, he, often, professed, to, abhor, the, tastes, of, the, majority, of, the, people, who, read, for, pleasure, in, his, time, in, his, critical, works, poe, investigated, and, wrote, about, many, of, the, pseudosciences, that, were, then, popular, with, the, majority, of, his, fellow, americans, they, included, but, were, not, limited, to, the, fields, of, astrology, cosmology, phrenology, and, physiognomy, poe, s, writings, often, reflect, the, literary, theories, he, introduced, in, his, prolific, critical, works, and, expounded, on, in, such, essays, as, the, poetic, principle, he, disliked, didacticism, and, imitation, masquerading, as, influence, believing, originality, to, be, the, highest, mark, of, genius, in, poe, s, conception, of, the, artist, s, life, the, attainment, of, the, concretization, of, beauty, should, be, the, ultimate, goal, that, which, is, unique, is, alone, of, value, works, with, obvious, meanings, he, wrote, cease, to, be, art, he, believed, that, any, work, worthy, of, being, praised, should, have, as, its, focus, a, single, specific, effect, that, which, does, not, tend, towards, the, effect, is, extraneous, in, his, view, every, serious, writer, must, carefully, calculate, each, sentiment, and, idea, in, his, or, her, work, to, ensure, that, it, strengthens, the, theme, of, the, piece, poe, describes, the, method, he, employed, while, composing, his, most, famous, poem, the, raven, in, an, essay, entitled, the, philosophy, of, composition, however, many, of, poe, s, critics, have, questioned, whether, the, method, enunciated, in, the, essay, was, formulated, before, the, poem, was, written, or, afterward, or, as, t, s, eliot, is, quoted, as, saying, it, is, difficult, for, us, to, read, that, essay, without, reflecting, that, if, poe, plotted, out, his, poem, with, such, calculation, he, might, have, taken, a, little, more, pains, over, it, the, result, hardly, does, credit, to, the, method, biographer, joseph, wood, krutch, described, the, essay, as, a, rather, highly, ingenious, exercise, in, the, art, of, rationalization, during, his, lifetime, poe, was, mostly, recognized, as, a, literary, critic, the, vast, majority, of, edgar, allan, poe, s, writings, are, nonfictional, contemporary, critic, james, russell, lowell, called, him, the, most, discriminating, philosophical, and, fearless, critic, upon, imaginative, works, who, has, written, in, america, suggesting, rhetorically, that, he, occasionally, used, prussic, acid, instead, of, ink, poe, s, often, caustic, reviews, earned, him, the, reputation, of, being, a, tomahawk, man, poe, s, idea, of, criticism, was, not, to, praise, prose, or, poetry, that, was, obviously, successful, and, therefore, could, speak, for, itself, but, to, draw, attention, to, what, was, not, successful, in, the, writings, of, even, those, he, highly, respected, his, aim, being, to, elevate, the, art, of, literature, as, a, whole, poe, felt, no, need, to, praise, what, was, already, so, obviously, praiseworthy, rather, he, attempted, to, point, out, the, imperfections, in, works, other, critics, considered, perfect, so, as, to, hasten, the, evolution, of, literature, and, in, particular, american, literature, a, so, called, favorite, target, of, poe, s, criticism, was, boston, s, acclaimed, poet, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, who, was, defended, by, his, friends, literary, and, otherwise, in, what, was, later, called, the, longfellow, war, poe, accused, longfellow, of, the, heresy, of, the, didactic, writing, poetry, that, was, preachy, derivative, and, thematically, plagiarized, poe, correctly, predicted, that, longfellow, s, reputation, and, style, of, poetry, would, decline, concluding, we, grant, him, high, qualities, but, deny, him, the, future, poe, became, known, as, the, creator, of, a, type, of, fiction, that, was, difficult, to, categorize, and, nearly, impossible, to, imitate, he, was, one, of, the, first, american, authors, of, the, 19th, century, to, become, more, popular, in, europe, than, in, the, united, states, poe, was, particularly, esteemed, in, france, in, part, due, to, early, translations, of, his, work, by, charles, baudelaire, baudelaire, s, translations, became, definitive, renditions, of, poe, s, work, in, continental, europe, poe, s, early, mystery, tales, featuring, the, detective, c, auguste, dupin, though, not, numerous, laid, the, groundwork, for, similar, characters, that, would, eventually, become, famous, throughout, the, world, sir, arthur, conan, doyle, said, each, is, a, root, from, which, a, whole, literature, has, developed, where, was, the, detective, story, until, poe, breathed, the, breath, of, life, into, it, the, mystery, writers, of, america, have, named, their, awards, for, excellence, in, the, mystery, genre, the, edgars, poe, s, work, also, influenced, writings, that, would, eventually, come, to, be, called, science, fiction, notably, the, works, of, jules, verne, who, wrote, a, sequel, to, poe, s, novel, the, narrative, of, arthur, gordon, pym, of, nantucket, called, an, antarctic, mystery, also, known, as, the, sphinx, of, the, ice, fields, and, as, the, author, h, g, wells, noted, pym, tells, what, a, very, intelligent, mind, could, imagine, about, the, south, polar, region, a, century, ago, in, 2013, the, guardian, cited, pym, as, one, of, the, greatest, novels, ever, written, in, the, english, language, and, noted, its, influence, on, later, authors, such, as, doyle, henry, james, b, traven, and, david, morrell, horror, author, and, historian, h, p, lovecraft, was, heavily, influenced, by, poe, s, horror, tales, dedicating, an, entire, section, of, his, long, essay, supernatural, horror, in, literature, to, his, influence, on, the, genre, in, his, letters, lovecraft, described, poe, as, his, god, of, fiction, lovecraft, s, earliest, stories, are, clearly, influenced, by, poe, at, the, mountains, of, madness, directly, quotes, him, lovecraft, made, extensive, use, of, poe, s, concept, of, the, unity, of, effect, in, his, fiction, alfred, hitchcock, once, said, it, s, because, i, liked, edgar, allan, poe, s, stories, so, much, that, i, began, to, make, suspense, films, many, references, to, poe, s, works, are, present, in, vladimir, nabokov, s, novels, other, writers, inspired, by, poe, s, poetry, and, fiction, include, but, are, not, limited, to, ray, bradbury, stephen, king, and, the, beat, generation, s, allen, ginsberg, poe, s, works, have, spawned, many, imitators, one, trend, among, poe, s, more, ardent, fans, has, been, the, tendency, to, employ, clairvoyants, or, psychics, to, channel, original, poems, from, poe, s, spirit, one, of, the, most, notable, of, these, manuscripts, was, by, lizzie, doten, who, published, poems, from, the, inner, life, in, 1863, in, which, she, claimed, to, have, received, new, compositions, by, poe, however, the, writings, appeared, to, be, simple, revisions, of, previously, published, poems, poe, has, also, received, criticism, this, is, partly, because, of, the, negative, perception, of, his, personal, character, and, its, influence, upon, his, reputation, william, butler, yeats, was, occasionally, critical, of, poe, and, once, called, him, vulgar, transcendentalist, ralph, waldo, emerson, reacted, to, the, raven, by, saying, i, see, nothing, in, it, and, derisively, referred, to, poe, as, the, jingle, man, aldous, huxley, wrote, that, poe, s, writing, falls, into, vulgarity, by, being, too, poetical, the, equivalent, of, wearing, a, diamond, ring, on, every, finger, it, is, believed, that, only, twelve, copies, have, survived, of, poe, s, first, book, tamerlane, and, other, poems, in, december, 2009, one, copy, sold, at, christie, s, auctioneers, in, new, york, city, for, 662, 500, a, record, price,

as, the, first, plausible, solution, to, olbers, paradox, poe, eschewed, the, scientific, method, in, eureka, and, instead, wrote, from, pure, intuition, for, this, reason, he, considered, it, a, work, of, art, not, science, but, insisted, that, it, was, still, true, and, considered, it, to, be, his, career, masterpiece, even, so, eureka, is, full, of, scientific, errors, in, particular, poe, s, suggestions, ignored, newtonian, principles, regarding, the, density, and, rotation, of, planets, poe, had, a, keen, interest, in, cryptography, he, had, placed, a, notice, of, his, abilities, in, the, philadelphia, paper, alexander, s, weekly, express, messenger, inviting, submissions, of, ciphers, which, he, proceeded, to, solve, in, july, 1841, poe, had, published, an, essay, called, a, few, words, on, secret, writing, in, graham, s, magazine, capitalizing, on, public, interest, in, the, topic, he, wrote, the, gold, bug, incorporating, ciphers, as, an, essential, part, of, the, story, poe, s, success, with, cryptography, relied, not, so, much, on, his, deep, knowledge, of, that, field, his, method, was, limited, to, the, simple, substitution, cryptogram, as, on, his, knowledge, of, the, magazine, and, newspaper, culture, his, keen, analytical, abilities, which, were, so, evident, in, his, detective, stories, allowed, him, to, see, that, the, general, public, was, largely, ignorant, of, the, methods, by, which, a, simple, substitution, cryptogram, can, be, solved, and, he, used, this, to, his, advantage, the, sensation, that, poe, created, with, his, cryptography, stunts, played, a, major, role, in, popularizing, cryptograms, in, newspapers, and, magazines, two, ciphers, he, published, in, 1841, under, the, name, w, b, tyler, were, not, solved, until, 1992, and, 2000, respectively, one, was, a, quote, from, joseph, addison, s, play, cato, the, other, is, probably, based, on, a, poem, by, hester, thrale, poe, had, an, influence, on, cryptography, beyond, increasing, public, interest, during, his, lifetime, william, friedman, america, s, foremost, cryptologist, was, heavily, influenced, by, poe, friedman, s, initial, interest, in, cryptography, came,
