joseph, ii, german, josef, benedikt, anton, michael, adam, english, joseph, benedict, anthony, michael, adam, 13, march, 1741, 20, february, 1790, was, holy, roman, emperor, from, 18, august, 1765, and, sole, ruler, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, from, 29, november, 1780, until, his, death, he, was, the, eldest, son, of, empress, maria, theresa, and, her, husband, emperor, francis, i, and, the, brother, of, marie, antoinette, leopold, ii, maria, carolina, of, austria, and, maria, amalia, duchess, of, parma, he, was, thus, the, first, ruler, in, the, austrian, dominions, of, the, union, of, the, houses, of, habsburg, and, lorraine, styled, habsburg, lorraine, joseph, was, a, proponent, of, enlightened, absolutism, however, his, commitment, to, secularizing, liberalizing, and, modernizing, reforms, resulted, in, significant, opposition, which, resulted, in, failure, to, fully, implement, his, programs, meanwhile, despite, making, some, territorial, gains, his, reckless, foreign, policy, badly, isolated, austria, he, has, been, ranked, with, catherine, the, great, of, russia, and, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, as, one, of, the, three, great, enlightenment, monarchs, false, but, influential, letters, depict, him, as, a, somewhat, more, radical, philosophe, than, he, probably, was, his, policies, are, now, known, as, josephinism, he, was, a, supporter, of, the, arts, particularly, of, composers, such, as, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, and, antonio, salieri, he, died, with, no, known, surviving, legitimate, offspring, and, was, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, leopold, ii, joseph, was, born, in, the, midst, of, the, early, upheavals, of, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, his, formal, education, was, provided, through, the, writings, of, david, hume, edward, gibbon, voltaire, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, the, encyclop, distes, and, by, the, example, of, his, contemporary, and, sometimes, rival, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, his, practical, training, was, conferred, by, government, officials, who, were, directed, to, instruct, him, in, the, mechanical, details, of, the, administration, of, the, numerous, states, composing, the, austrian, dominions, and, the, holy, roman, empire, joseph, married, princess, isabella, of, parma, in, october, 1760, a, union, fashioned, to, bolster, the, 1756, defensive, pact, between, france, and, austria, the, bride, s, mother, princess, louise, lisabeth, was, the, eldest, daughter, of, louis, xv, of, france, and, his, popular, wife, queen, marie, leczinska, isabella, s, father, was, philip, duke, of, parma, joseph, loved, his, bride, isabella, finding, her, both, stimulating, and, charming, and, she, sought, with, special, care, to, cultivate, his, favor, and, affection, isabella, also, found, a, best, friend, and, confidant, in, her, husband, s, sister, maria, christina, duchess, of, teschen, the, marriage, of, joseph, and, isabella, resulted, in, the, birth, of, a, daughter, maria, theresa, isabella, was, fearful, of, pregnancy, and, early, death, largely, a, result, of, the, early, loss, of, her, mother, her, own, pregnancy, proved, especially, difficult, as, she, suffered, symptoms, of, pain, illness, and, melancholy, both, during, and, afterward, though, joseph, attended, to, her, and, tried, to, comfort, her, she, remained, bedridden, for, six, weeks, after, their, daughter, s, birth, almost, immediately, on, the, back, of, their, newfound, parenthood, the, couple, then, endured, two, consecutive, miscarriages, an, ordeal, particularly, hard, on, isabella, followed, quickly, by, another, pregnancy, pregnancy, was, again, provoking, melancholy, fears, and, dread, in, isabella, in, november, 1763, while, six, months, pregnant, isabella, fell, ill, with, smallpox, and, went, into, premature, labor, resulting, in, the, birth, of, their, second, child, archduchess, maria, christina, who, died, shortly, after, being, born, progressively, ill, with, smallpox, and, strained, by, sudden, childbirth, and, tragedy, isabella, died, the, following, week, the, loss, of, his, beloved, wife, and, their, newborn, child, was, devastating, for, joseph, after, which, he, felt, keenly, reluctant, to, remarry, though, he, dearly, loved, his, daughter, and, remained, a, devoted, father, to, maria, theresa, for, political, reasons, and, under, constant, pressure, in, 1765, he, relented, and, married, his, second, cousin, princess, maria, josepha, of, bavaria, the, daughter, of, charles, vii, holy, roman, emperor, and, archduchess, maria, amalia, of, austria, this, marriage, proved, extremely, unhappy, albeit, brief, as, it, lasted, only, two, years, though, maria, josepha, loved, her, husband, she, felt, timid, and, inferior, in, his, company, lacking, common, interests, or, pleasures, the, relationship, offered, little, for, joseph, who, confessed, he, felt, no, love, nor, attraction, for, her, in, return, he, adapted, by, distancing, himself, from, his, wife, to, the, point, of, near, total, avoidance, seeing, her, only, at, meals, and, upon, retiring, to, bed, maria, josepha, in, turn, suffered, considerable, misery, in, finding, herself, locked, in, a, cold, loveless, union, four, months, after, the, second, anniversary, of, their, wedding, maria, josepha, grew, ill, and, died, from, smallpox, joseph, neither, visited, her, during, her, illness, nor, attended, her, funeral, though, he, later, expressed, regret, for, not, having, shown, her, more, kindness, respect, or, warmth, one, thing, the, union, did, provide, him, was, the, improved, possibility, of, laying, claim, to, a, portion, of, bavaria, though, this, would, ultimately, lead, to, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, joseph, never, remarried, in, 1770, joseph, s, only, surviving, child, the, seven, year, old, maria, theresa, became, ill, with, pleurisy, and, died, the, loss, of, his, daughter, was, deeply, traumatic, for, him, and, left, him, grief, stricken, and, scarred, lacking, children, joseph, ii, was, ultimately, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, who, became, leopold, ii, joseph, was, made, a, member, of, the, constituted, council, of, state, staatsrat, and, began, to, draw, up, minutes, for, his, mother, to, read, these, papers, contain, the, germs, of, his, later, policy, and, of, all, the, disasters, that, finally, overtook, him, he, was, a, friend, to, religious, toleration, anxious, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, church, to, relieve, the, peasantry, of, feudal, burdens, and, to, remove, restrictions, on, trade, and, knowledge, in, these, he, did, not, differ, from, frederick, or, his, own, brother, and, successor, leopold, ii, all, enlightened, rulers, of, the, 18th, century, he, tried, to, liberate, serfs, but, that, did, not, last, after, his, death, where, joseph, differed, from, great, contemporary, rulers, and, was, akin, to, the, jacobins, in, the, intensity, of, his, belief, in, the, power, of, the, state, when, directed, by, reason, as, an, absolutist, ruler, however, he, was, also, convinced, of, his, right, to, speak, for, the, state, uncontrolled, by, laws, and, of, the, wisdom, of, his, own, rule, he, had, also, inherited, from, his, mother, the, belief, of, the, house, of, austria, in, its, august, quality, and, its, claim, to, acquire, whatever, it, found, desirable, for, its, power, or, profit, he, was, unable, to, understand, that, his, philosophical, plans, for, the, moulding, of, humanity, could, meet, with, pardonable, opposition, joseph, was, documented, by, contemporaries, as, being, impressive, but, not, necessarily, likable, in, 1760, his, arranged, consort, the, well, educated, isabella, of, parma, was, handed, over, to, him, joseph, appears, to, have, been, completely, in, love, with, her, but, isabella, preferred, the, companionship, of, joseph, s, sister, marie, christine, of, austria, the, overweening, character, of, the, emperor, was, obvious, to, frederick, ii, of, prussia, who, after, their, first, interview, in, 1769, described, him, as, ambitious, and, as, capable, of, setting, the, world, on, fire, the, french, minister, vergennes, who, met, joseph, when, he, was, traveling, incognito, in, 1777, judged, him, to, be, ambitious, and, despotic, after, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1765, he, became, emperor, and, was, made, co, regent, by, his, mother, in, the, austrian, dominions, as, emperor, he, had, little, true, power, and, his, mother, had, resolved, that, neither, her, husband, nor, her, son, should, ever, deprive, her, of, sovereign, control, in, her, hereditary, dominions, joseph, by, threatening, to, resign, his, place, as, co, regent, could, induce, his, mother, to, abate, her, dislike, for, religious, toleration, he, could, and, did, place, a, great, strain, on, her, patience, and, temper, as, in, the, case, of, the, first, partition, of, poland, and, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, of, 1778, 1779, but, in, the, last, resort, the, empress, spoke, the, final, word, therefore, until, the, death, of, his, mother, in, 1780, joseph, was, never, quite, free, to, follow, his, own, instincts, during, these, years, joseph, traveled, much, he, met, frederick, the, great, privately, at, neisse, in, 1769, later, painted, in, the, meeting, of, frederick, ii, and, joseph, ii, in, neisse, in, 1769, and, again, at, m, hrisch, neustadt, in, 1770, the, two, rulers, initially, got, along, well, on, the, second, occasion, he, was, accompanied, by, prince, kaunitz, whose, conversation, with, frederick, may, be, said, to, mark, the, starting, point, of, the, first, partition, of, poland, to, this, and, to, every, other, measure, which, promised, to, extend, the, dominions, of, his, house, joseph, gave, hearty, approval, thus, when, frederick, fell, severely, ill, in, 1775, joseph, assembled, an, army, in, bohemia, which, in, the, event, of, frederick, s, death, was, to, advance, into, prussia, and, demand, silesia, a, territory, frederick, had, conquered, from, maria, theresa, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, however, frederick, recovered, and, thereafter, became, wary, and, mistrustful, of, joseph, joseph, was, also, eager, to, enforce, austria, s, claim, on, bavaria, upon, the, death, of, the, elector, maximilian, iii, in, 1777, in, april, of, that, year, he, paid, a, visit, to, his, sister, the, queen, of, france, marie, antoinette, of, austria, traveling, under, the, name, of, count, falkenstein, he, was, well, received, and, much, flattered, by, the, encyclopedists, but, his, observations, led, him, to, predict, the, approaching, downfall, of, the, french, monarchy, and, he, was, not, impressed, favorably, by, the, french, army, or, navy, in, 1778, he, commanded, the, troops, collected, to, oppose, frederick, who, supported, the, rival, claimant, to, bavaria, this, was, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, real, fighting, was, averted, by, the, unwillingness, of, frederick, to, embark, on, a, new, war, and, by, maria, theresa, s, determination, to, maintain, peace, however, the, war, cost, joseph, most, of, his, influence, over, the, other, german, princes, who, were, wary, of, his, potential, designs, on, their, lands, and, looked, to, frederick, as, their, protector, as, the, son, of, francis, i, joseph, succeeded, him, as, titular, duke, of, lorraine, and, bar, which, had, been, surrendered, to, france, on, his, father, s, marriage, and, titular, king, of, jerusalem, and, duke, of, calabria, as, a, proxy, for, the, kingdom, of, naples, the, death, of, maria, theresa, on, 29, november, 1780, left, joseph, free, to, pursue, his, own, policy, and, he, immediately, directed, his, government, on, a, new, course, attempting, to, realize, his, ideal, of, enlightened, despotism, acting, on, a, definite, system, for, the, good, of, all, he, undertook, the, spread, of, education, the, secularization, of, church, lands, the, reduction, of, the, religious, orders, and, the, clergy, in, general, to, complete, submission, to, the, lay, state, the, issue, of, the, patent, of, toleration, 1781, providing, limited, guarantee, of, freedom, of, worship, and, the, promotion, of, unity, by, the, compulsory, use, of, the, german, language, replacing, latin, or, in, some, instances, local, languages, everything, which, from, the, point, of, view, of, 18th, century, philosophy, the, age, of, enlightenment, appeared, reasonable, he, strove, for, administrative, unity, with, characteristic, haste, to, reach, results, without, preparation, joseph, carried, out, measures, of, the, emancipation, of, the, peasantry, which, his, mother, had, begun, and, abolished, serfdom, in, 1781, in, 1789, he, decreed, that, peasants, must, be, paid, in, cash, payments, rather, than, labor, obligations, these, policies, were, violently, rejected, by, the, nobility, clergy, merchants, and, the, peasants, since, their, barter, economy, lacked, money, joseph, also, abolished, the, death, penalty, in, 1787, a, reform, that, remained, until, 1795, after, the, outbreak, of, the, french, revolution, in, 1789, joseph, sought, to, help, the, family, of, his, estranged, sister, queen, marie, antoinette, of, france, and, her, husband, king, louis, xvi, joseph, kept, an, eye, on, the, development, of, the, revolution, and, became, actively, involved, in, the, planning, of, a, rescue, attempt, these, plans, failed, however, either, due, to, marie, antoinette, s, refusal, to, leave, her, children, behind, in, favor, of, a, faster, carriage, or, louis, xvi, s, reluctance, to, become, a, fugitive, king, joseph, died, in, 1790, making, negotiations, with, austria, about, possible, rescue, attempts, more, difficult, it, was, not, until, 21, june, 1791, that, an, attempt, was, made, with, the, help, of, count, fersen, a, swedish, general, who, had, been, favored, at, the, courts, of, both, marie, antoinette, and, joseph, the, attempt, failed, after, the, king, was, recognized, from, the, back, of, a, coin, marie, antoinette, became, increasingly, desperate, for, help, from, her, homeland, even, giving, french, military, secrets, to, austria, nevertheless, even, though, austria, was, at, war, with, france, at, the, time, it, refused, to, directly, help, the, by, now, completely, estranged, french, queen, when, maria, theresa, died, joseph, started, issuing, edicts, over, 6, 000, in, all, plus, 11, 000, new, laws, designed, to, regulate, and, reorder, every, aspect, of, the, empire, the, spirit, of, josephinism, was, benevolent, and, paternal, he, intended, to, make, his, people, happy, but, strictly, in, accordance, with, his, own, criteria, joseph, set, about, building, a, rationalized, centralized, and, uniform, government, for, his, diverse, lands, a, hierarchy, under, himself, as, a, supreme, autocrat, the, personnel, of, government, was, expected, to, be, imbued, with, the, same, dedicated, spirit, of, service, to, the, state, that, he, himself, had, it, was, recruited, without, favor, for, a, class, or, ethnic, origins, and, promotion, was, solely, by, merit, to, further, uniformity, the, emperor, made, german, the, compulsory, language, of, official, business, throughout, the, habsburg, monarchy, which, affected, especially, the, kingdom, of, hungary, the, diet, of, hungary, was, stripped, of, its, prerogatives, and, not, even, called, together, as, privy, finance, minister, count, karl, von, zinzendorf, 1739, 1813, introduced, a, uniform, system, of, accounting, for, state, revenues, expenditures, and, debts, of, the, territories, of, the, austrian, crown, austria, was, more, successful, than, france, in, meeting, regular, expenditures, and, in, gaining, credit, however, the, events, of, joseph, ii, s, last, years, also, suggest, that, the, government, was, financially, vulnerable, to, the, european, wars, that, ensued, after, 1792, the, emperor, also, attempted, to, simplify, the, administration, of, his, dominions, often, a, patchwork, of, states, united, in, personal, union, by, the, habsburg, monarch, as, an, example, in, 1786, he, abolished, the, separate, administration, of, the, duchy, of, mantua, merging, it, with, the, neighbouring, duchy, of, milan, local, opposition, to, the, change, forced, his, successor, leopold, ii, to, reverse, this, measure, and, restore, the, duchy, in, 1791, the, busy, joseph, inspired, a, complete, reform, of, the, legal, system, abolished, brutal, punishments, and, the, death, penalty, in, most, instances, and, imposed, the, principle, of, complete, equality, of, treatment, for, all, offenders, he, lightened, censorship, of, the, press, and, theatre, in, 1781, 1782, he, extended, full, legal, freedom, to, serfs, rentals, paid, by, peasants, were, to, be, regulated, by, officials, of, the, crown, and, taxes, were, levied, upon, all, income, derived, from, land, the, landlords, however, found, their, economic, position, threatened, and, eventually, reversed, the, policy, indeed, in, hungary, and, transylvania, the, resistance, of, the, magnates, was, such, that, joseph, had, to, content, himself, for, a, while, with, halfway, measures, of, the, five, million, hungarians, 40, 000, were, nobles, of, whom, 4, 000, were, magnates, who, owned, and, ruled, the, land, most, of, the, remainder, were, serfs, legally, tied, to, particular, estates, after, the, collapse, of, the, peasant, revolt, of, horea, 1784, 1785, in, which, over, a, hundred, nobles, were, killed, the, emperor, acted, his, imperial, patent, of, 1785, abolished, serfdom, but, did, not, give, the, peasants, ownership, of, the, land, or, freedom, from, dues, owed, to, the, landowning, nobles, it, did, give, them, personal, freedom, emancipation, of, the, peasants, from, the, kingdom, of, hungary, promoted, the, growth, of, a, new, class, of, taxable, landholders, but, it, did, not, abolish, the, deep, seated, ills, of, feudalism, and, the, exploitation, of, the, landless, squatters, feudalism, in, the, habsburg, monarchy, finally, ended, in, 1848, to, equalize, the, incidence, of, taxation, joseph, caused, an, appraisal, of, all, the, lands, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, to, be, made, so, that, he, might, impose, a, single, and, egalitarian, tax, on, land, the, goal, was, to, modernize, the, relationship, of, dependence, between, the, landowners, and, peasantry, relieve, some, of, the, tax, burden, on, the, peasantry, and, increase, state, revenues, joseph, looked, on, the, tax, and, land, reforms, as, being, interconnected, and, strove, to, implement, them, at, the, same, time, the, various, commissions, he, established, to, formulate, and, carry, out, the, reforms, met, resistance, among, the, nobility, the, peasantry, and, some, officials, most, of, the, reforms, were, abrogated, shortly, before, or, after, joseph, s, death, in, 1790, they, were, doomed, to, failure, from, the, start, because, they, tried, to, change, too, much, in, too, short, a, time, and, tried, to, radically, alter, the, traditional, customs, and, relationships, that, the, villagers, had, long, depended, upon, in, the, cities, the, new, economic, principles, of, the, enlightenment, called, for, the, destruction, of, the, autonomous, guilds, already, weakened, during, the, age, of, mercantilism, joseph, ii, s, tax, reforms, and, the, institution, of, katastralgemeinde, tax, districts, for, the, large, estates, served, this, purpose, and, new, factory, privileges, ended, guild, rights, while, customs, laws, aimed, at, economic, unity, physiocratic, influence, also, led, to, the, inclusion, of, agriculture, in, these, reforms, to, produce, a, literate, citizenry, elementary, education, was, made, compulsory, for, all, boys, and, girls, and, higher, education, on, practical, lines, was, offered, for, a, select, few, joseph, created, scholarships, for, talented, poor, students, and, allowed, the, establishment, of, schools, for, jews, and, other, religious, minorities, in, 1784, he, ordered, that, the, country, change, its, language, of, instruction, from, latin, to, german, a, highly, controversial, step, in, a, multilingual, empire, by, the, 18th, century, centralization, was, the, trend, in, medicine, because, more, and, better, educated, doctors, were, requesting, improved, facilities, cities, lacked, the, budgets, to, fund, local, hospitals, and, the, monarchy, wanted, to, end, costly, epidemics, and, quarantines, joseph, attempted, to, centralize, medical, care, in, vienna, through, the, construction, of, a, single, large, hospital, the, famous, allgemeines, krankenhaus, which, opened, in, 1784, centralization, worsened, sanitation, problems, causing, epidemics, and, a, 20, death, rate, in, the, new, hospital, the, city, nevertheless, became, preeminent, in, the, medical, field, in, the, next, century, joseph, s, policy, of, religious, toleration, was, the, most, aggressive, of, any, state, in, europe, probably, the, most, unpopular, of, all, his, reforms, was, his, attempted, modernization, of, the, highly, traditional, catholic, church, which, in, medieval, times, had, helped, establish, the, holy, roman, empire, beginning, with, charlemagne, calling, himself, the, guardian, of, catholicism, joseph, ii, struck, vigorously, at, papal, power, he, tried, to, make, the, catholic, church, in, his, territories, the, tool, of, the, state, independent, of, rome, clergymen, were, deprived, of, the, tithe, and, ordered, to, study, in, seminaries, under, government, supervision, while, bishops, had, to, take, a, formal, oath, of, loyalty, to, the, crown, he, financed, the, large, increase, in, bishoprics, parishes, and, secular, clergy, by, extensive, sales, of, monastic, lands, as, a, man, of, the, enlightenment, he, ridiculed, the, contemplative, monastic, orders, which, he, considered, unproductive, accordingly, he, suppressed, a, third, of, the, monasteries, over, 700, were, closed, and, reduced, the, number, of, monks, and, nuns, from, 65, 000, to, 27, 000, the, church, s, ecclesiastical, tribunals, were, abolished, and, marriage, was, defined, as, a, civil, contract, outside, the, jurisdiction, of, the, church, joseph, sharply, cut, the, number, of, holy, days, to, be, observed, in, the, habsburg, monarchy, and, ordered, ornamentation, in, churches, to, be, reduced, he, forcibly, simplified, the, manner, in, which, the, mass, the, central, catholic, act, of, worship, was, celebrated, opponents, of, the, reforms, blamed, them, for, revealing, protestant, tendencies, with, the, rise, of, enlightenment, rationalism, and, the, emergence, of, a, liberal, class, of, bourgeois, officials, anti, clericalism, emerged, and, persisted, while, the, traditional, catholics, were, energized, in, opposition, to, the, emperor, joseph, s, patent, of, toleration, in, 1781, was, a, major, shift, away, from, the, inquisitive, religious, policies, of, the, counter, reformation, that, were, previously, predominant, in, the, monarchy, limited, religious, freedom, of, worship, was, given, to, major, non, catholic, christian, sects, although, conversion, from, catholicism, was, still, restricted, this, was, followed, by, the, edict, of, tolerance, in, 1782, removing, many, restrictions, and, regulations, on, jews, the, secularization, decree, issued, on, 12, january, 1782, banned, several, monastic, orders, not, involved, in, teaching, or, healing, and, liquidated, 140, monasteries, home, to, 1484, monks, and, 190, nuns, the, banned, monastic, orders, jesuits, camaldolese, order, of, friars, minor, capuchin, carmelites, carthusians, poor, clares, order, of, saint, benedict, cistercians, dominican, order, order, of, preachers, franciscans, pauline, fathers, and, premonstratensians, and, their, wealth, was, taken, over, by, the, religious, fund, his, anticlerical, and, liberal, innovations, induced, pope, pius, vi, to, pay, him, a, visit, in, march, 1782, joseph, received, the, pope, politely, and, showed, himself, a, good, catholic, but, refused, to, be, influenced, on, the, other, hand, joseph, was, very, friendly, to, freemasonry, as, he, found, it, highly, compatible, with, his, own, enlightenment, philosophy, although, he, apparently, never, joined, a, lodge, himself, freemasonry, attracted, many, anticlericals, and, was, condemned, by, the, church, joseph, s, feelings, towards, religion, are, reflected, in, a, witticism, he, once, spoke, in, paris, while, being, given, a, tour, of, the, sorbonne, s, library, the, archivist, took, joseph, to, a, dark, room, containing, religious, documents, and, lamented, the, lack, of, light, which, prevented, joseph, from, being, able, to, read, them, joseph, put, the, man, at, rest, by, saying, ah, when, it, comes, to, theology, there, is, never, much, light, thus, joseph, was, undoubtedly, a, much, laxer, catholic, than, his, mother, in, 1789, he, issued, a, charter, of, religious, toleration, for, the, jews, of, galicia, a, region, with, a, large, yiddish, speaking, traditional, jewish, population, the, charter, abolished, communal, autonomy, whereby, the, jews, controlled, their, internal, affairs, it, promoted, germanization, and, the, wearing, of, non, jewish, clothing, the, habsburg, empire, also, had, a, policy, of, war, expansion, colonization, and, trade, as, well, as, exporting, intellectual, influences, while, opposing, prussia, and, turkey, austria, maintained, its, defensive, alliance, with, france, and, was, friendly, to, russia, though, trying, to, remove, the, danubian, principalities, from, russian, influence, mayer, argues, that, joseph, was, an, excessively, belligerent, expansionist, leader, who, sought, to, make, the, habsburg, monarchy, the, greatest, of, the, european, powers, his, main, goal, was, to, acquire, bavaria, if, necessary, in, exchange, for, the, austrian, netherlands, but, in, 1778, and, again, in, 1785, he, was, thwarted, by, king, frederick, ii, of, prussia, whom, he, feared, greatly, on, the, second, occasion, a, number, of, other, german, princes, wary, of, joseph, s, designs, on, their, lands, joined, frederick, s, side, joseph, s, travels, through, russia, in, 1780, included, a, visit, with, the, russian, empress, catherine, which, started, talks, that, would, later, lead, to, the, austro, russian, alliance, 1781, including, an, offensive, clause, to, be, used, against, the, ottomans, this, was, a, significant, diplomatic, development, as, it, neutralised, the, previous, russian, prussian, alliance, which, had, threatened, the, monarchy, into, peace, during, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, the, agreement, with, russia, would, later, lead, austria, into, the, expensive, and, largely, futile, austro, turkish, war, 1787, 1791, joseph, ii, travelled, with, only, a, few, servants, on, horseback, as, count, falkenstein, he, preferred, to, stop, at, a, regular, inn, forcing, catherine, ii, to, convert, a, wing, of, her, palace, cajoling, her, gardener, to, act, as, inn, keeper, joseph, s, participation, in, the, ottoman, war, was, reluctant, attributable, not, to, his, usual, acquisitiveness, but, rather, to, his, close, ties, to, russia, which, he, saw, as, the, necessary, price, to, be, paid, for, the, security, of, his, people, after, initial, defeats, the, austrians, won, a, string, of, victories, in, 1789, including, the, capture, of, belgrade, a, key, turkish, fortress, in, the, balkans, these, victories, however, would, not, amount, to, any, significant, gains, for, the, monarchy, under, the, threat, of, prussian, intervention, and, with, the, worrying, state, of, the, revolution, in, france, the, treaty, of, sistova, of, 1791, ended, the, war, with, only, token, gains, the, balkan, policy, of, both, maria, theresa, and, joseph, ii, reflected, the, cameralism, promoted, by, prince, kaunitz, stressing, consolidation, of, the, borderlands, by, reorganization, and, expansion, of, the, military, frontier, transylvania, was, incorporated, into, the, frontier, in, 1761, and, the, frontier, regiments, became, the, backbone, of, the, military, order, with, the, regimental, commander, exercising, military, and, civilian, power, populationistik, was, the, prevailing, theory, of, colonization, which, measured, prosperity, in, terms, of, labor, joseph, ii, also, stressed, economic, development, habsburg, influence, was, an, essential, factor, in, balkan, development, in, the, last, half, of, the, 18th, century, especially, for, the, serbs, and, croats, multiple, interferences, with, old, customs, began, to, produce, unrest, in, all, parts, of, his, dominions, meanwhile, joseph, threw, himself, into, a, succession, of, foreign, policies, all, aimed, at, aggrandizement, and, all, equally, calculated, to, offend, his, neighbors, all, taken, up, with, zeal, and, dropped, in, discouragement, he, endeavored, to, get, rid, of, the, barrier, treaty, which, debarred, his, flemish, subjects, from, the, navigation, of, the, scheldt, when, he, was, opposed, by, france, he, turned, to, other, schemes, of, alliance, with, the, russian, empire, for, the, partition, of, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, republic, of, venice, these, plans, also, had, to, be, given, up, in, the, face, of, the, opposition, of, neighbors, and, in, particular, of, france, then, joseph, resumed, his, attempts, to, obtain, bavaria, this, time, by, exchanging, it, for, the, austrian, netherlands, and, only, provoked, the, formation, of, the, f, rstenbund, organized, by, frederick, ii, of, prussia, nobility, throughout, his, empire, was, largely, opposed, to, his, policies, on, taxes, and, his, egalitarian, and, despotic, attitudes, in, the, austrian, netherlands, and, hungary, everyone, resented, the, way, he, tried, to, do, away, with, all, regional, government, and, to, subordinate, everything, to, his, own, personal, rule, in, vienna, the, ordinary, people, were, not, happy, they, loathed, the, emperor, s, interference, in, every, detail, of, their, daily, lives, as, it, seems, joseph, was, reforming, the, policies, of, the, habsburg, empire, based, on, his, own, criteria, and, personal, inclinations, rather, than, for, the, good, of, the, people, from, many, of, joseph, s, regulations, enforced, by, the, secret, police, it, looked, to, the, austrians, as, though, joseph, were, trying, to, reform, their, characters, as, well, as, their, institutions, only, a, few, weeks, before, joseph, s, death, the, director, of, the, imperial, police, reported, to, him, all, classes, and, even, those, who, have, the, greatest, respect, for, the, sovereign, are, discontented, and, indignant, in, lombardy, in, northern, italy, the, cautious, reforms, of, maria, theresa, enjoyed, support, from, local, reformers, joseph, ii, however, by, creating, a, powerful, imperial, officialdom, directed, from, vienna, undercut, the, dominant, position, of, the, milanese, principate, and, the, traditions, of, jurisdiction, and, administration, in, the, place, of, provincial, autonomy, he, established, an, unlimited, centralism, which, reduced, lombardy, politically, and, economically, to, a, fringe, area, of, the, empire, as, a, reaction, to, these, radical, changes, the, middle, class, reformers, shifted, away, from, cooperation, to, strong, resistance, from, this, basis, appeared, the, beginnings, of, the, later, lombard, liberalism, in, 1784, joseph, ii, attempted, to, make, german, an, official, language, in, hungary, after, he, had, renamed, the, burgtheater, in, vienna, the, german, national, theatre, in, 1776, ferenc, sz, ch, nyi, responded, by, convening, of, a, meeting, and, said, there, we, ll, see, whether, his, patriotism, also, passes, to, the, crown, julius, keglevi, responded, with, a, letter, in, german, to, joseph, ii, i, write, german, not, because, of, the, instruction, your, grace, but, because, i, have, to, do, with, a, german, citizen, the, german, citizen, joseph, ii, let, them, bring, the, holy, crown, of, hungary, to, vienna, where, he, gave, the, keys, of, the, chest, in, which, the, crown, was, locked, to, the, crown, guards, joseph, keglevi, and, miklos, n, dasdy, joseph, refrained, from, staging, a, coronation, that, later, resulted, in, him, earning, the, nickname, kalapos, kir, ly, king, with, a, hat, in, hungary, and, ferenc, sz, ch, nyi, pulled, out, of, politics, the, austrian, civil, code, also, called, joseph, s, civil, code, the, predecessor, of, the, civil, code,

occasion, the, people, held, a, mass, celebration, one, reason, for, his, refusal, to, be, crowned, with, the, holy, crown, of, hungary, might, have, been, that, alcuin, had, written, in, a, letter, to, charlemagne, in, 798, and, those, people, should, not, be, listened, to, who, keep, saying, the, voice, of, the, people, is, the, voice, of, god, since, the, riotousness, of, the, crowd, is, always, very, close, to, madness, by, 1790, rebellions, had, broken, out, in, protest, against, joseph, s, reforms, in, the, austrian, netherlands, the, brabant, revolution, and, hungary, and, his, other, dominions, were, restive, under, the, burdens, of, his, war, with, the, ottomans, his, empire, was, threatened, with, dissolution, and, he, was, forced, to, sacrifice, some, of, his, reform, projects, on, 30, january, 1790, he, formally, withdrew, all, his, reforms, in, hungary, except, for, three, the, patent, of, toleration, 1781, the, abolition, of, serfdom, 1785, and, one, improving, the, financial, situation, of, lower, ranking, priests, in, november, 1788, joseph, returned, to, vienna, with, ruined, health, and, was, left, abandoned, his, minister, kaunitz, refused, to, visit, his, sick, room, and, did, not, see, him, for, two, years, his, brother, leopold, remained, in, florence, at, last, joseph, worn, out, and, broken, hearted, recognized, that, his, servants, could, not, or, would, not, carry, out, his, plans, joseph, died, on, 20, february, 1790, he, is, buried, in, tomb, number, 42, in, the, imperial, crypt, in, vienna, he, asked, that, his, epitaph, read, here, lies, a, ruler, who, despite, his, best, intentions, was, unsuccessful, in, all, of, his, endeavors, hier, liegt, ein, f, rst, der, trotz, der, besten, meinung, keiner, seiner, pl, ne, durchsetzen, konnte, in, german, original, joseph, was, succeeded, by, his, brother, leopold, ii, biographer, derek, beales, ranked, joseph, ii, as, one, of, the, three, great, enlightenment, monarchs, with, catherine, the, great, of, russia, and, frederick, the, great, of, prussia, the, legacy, of, josephinism, would, live, on, through, the, austrian, enlightenment, to, an, extent, joseph, ii, s, enlightenment, beliefs, were, exaggerated, by, the, author, of, what, beales, called, the, false, constantinople, letters, long, considered, genuine, writings, of, joseph, ii, these, forged, works, have, erroneously, augmented, the, emperor, s, memory, for, centuries, these, legendary, quotations, have, created, a, larger, than, life, impression, of, joseph, ii, as, a, voltaire, and, diderot, like, philosophe, more, radical, than, he, probably, was, in, 1849, the, hungarian, declaration, of, independence, declared, that, joseph, ii, was, not, a, true, king, of, hungary, as, he, was, never, crowned, thus, any, act, from, his, reign, was, null, and, void, in, 1888, hungarian, historian, henrik, marczali, published, a, three, volume, study, of, joseph, the, first, important, modern, scholarly, work, on, his, reign, and, the, first, to, make, systematic, use, of, archival, research, marczali, was, jewish, and, a, product, of, the, bourgeois, liberal, school, of, historiography, in, hungary, and, he, portrayed, joseph, as, a, liberal, hero, the, russian, scholar, pavel, pavlovich, mitrofanov, published, a, thorough, biography, in, 1907, that, set, the, standard, for, a, century, after, it, was, translated, into, german, in, 1910, the, mitrofanov, interpretation, was, highly, damaging, to, joseph, he, was, not, a, populist, emperor, and, his, liberalism, was, a, myth, joseph, was, not, inspired, by, the, ideas, of, the, enlightenment, but, by, pure, power, politics, he, was, more, despot, than, his, mother, dogmatism, and, impatience, were, the, reasons, for, his, failures, p, g, m, dickson, noted, that, joseph, ii, rode, roughshod, over, age, old, aristocratic, privileges, liberties, and, prejudices, thereby, creating, for, himself, many, enemies, and, they, triumphed, in, the, end, joseph, s, attempt, to, reform, the, hungarian, lands, illustrates, the, weakness, of, absolutism, in, the, face, of, well, defended, feudal, liberties, behind, his, numerous, reforms, lay, a, comprehensive, program, influenced, by, the, doctrines, of, enlightened, absolutism, natural, law, mercantilism, and, physiocracy, with, a, goal, of, establishing, a, uniform, legal, framework, to, replace, heterogeneous, traditional, structures, the, reforms, were, guided, at, least, implicitly, by, the, principles, of, freedom, and, equality, and, were, based, on, a, conception, of, the, state, s, central, legislative, authority, joseph, s, accession, marks, a, major, break, since, the, preceding, reforms, under, maria, theresa, had, not, challenged, these, structures, but, there, was, no, similar, break, at, the, end, of, the, josephinian, era, the, reforms, initiated, by, joseph, ii, were, continued, to, varying, degrees, under, his, successor, leopold, and, later, successors, and, given, an, absolute, and, comprehensive, austrian, form, in, the, allgemeine, b, rgerliche, gesetzbuch, of, 1811, they, have, been, seen, as, providing, a, foundation, for, subsequent, reforms, extending, into, the, 20th, century, handled, by, much, better, politicians, than, joseph, ii, the, austrian, born, american, scholar, saul, k, padover, reached, a, wide, american, public, with, his, colorful, the, revolutionary, emperor, joseph, ii, of, austria, 1934, padover, celebrated, joseph, s, radicalism, saying, his, war, against, feudal, privileges, made, him, one, of, the, great, liberators, of, humanity, joseph, s, failures, were, attributed, to, his, impatience, and, lack, of, tact, and, his, unnecessary, military, adventures, but, despite, all, this, padover, claimed, the, emperor, was, the, greatest, of, all, enlightenment, monarchs, while, padover, depicted, a, sort, of, new, deal, democrat, nazi, historians, in, the, 1930s, made, joseph, a, precursor, of, adolf, hitler, a, new, era, of, historiography, began, in, the, 1960s, american, paul, bernard, rejected, the, german, national, radical, and, anticlerical, images, of, joseph, and, instead, emphasized, long, run, continuities, he, argued, that, joseph, s, reforms, were, well, suited, to, the, needs, of, the, day, many, failed, because, of, economic, backwardness, and, joseph, s, unfortunate, foreign, policy, british, historian, tim, blanning, stressed, profound, contradictions, inherent, in, his, policies, that, made, them, a, failure, for, example, joseph, encouraged, small, scale, peasant, holdings, thus, retarding, economic, modernization, that, only, the, large, estates, could, handle, french, historian, jean, berenger, concludes, that, despite, his, many, setbacks, joseph, s, reign, represented, a, decisive, phase, in, the, process, of, the, modernization, of, the, austrian, monarchy, the, failures, came, because, he, simply, wanted, to, do, too, much, too, fast, szabo, concludes, that, by, far, the, most, important, scholarship, on, joseph, is, by, derek, beales, appearing, over, three, decades, and, based, on, exhaustive, searches, in, many, archives, beales, looks, at, the, emperor, s, personality, with, its, arbitrary, behavior, and, mixture, of, affability, and, irascibility, beales, shows, that, joseph, genuinely, appreciated, mozart, s, music, and, greatly, admired, his, operas, like, most, other, scholars, beales, has, a, negative, view, of, joseph, s, foreign, policies, beales, finds, that, joseph, was, despotic, in, the, sense, of, transgressing, established, constitutions, and, rejecting, sound, advice, but, not, despotic, in, the, sense, of, any, gross, abuse, of, power, joseph, s, image, in, popular, memory, has, been, varied, after, his, death, there, were, many, monuments, to, him, built, by, the, central, government, across, his, lands, the, first, czechoslovak, republic, tore, down, the, monuments, when, it, became, independent, in, 1918, while, the, czechs, credited, joseph, ii, with, educational, reforms, religious, toleration, and, the, easing, of, censorship, they, condemned, his, policies, of, centralization, and, germanization, that, they, blamed, for, causing, a, decline, in, czech, culture, the, budapest, district, of, j, zsefv, ros, was, named, for, the, emperor, in, 1777, and, bears, this, name, up, to, the, present, like, many, of, the, enlightened, despots, of, his, time, joseph, was, a, lover, and, patron, of, the, arts, and, is, remembered, as, such, he, was, known, as, the, musical, king, and, steered, austrian, high, culture, towards, a, more, germanic, orientation, he, commissioned, the, german, language, opera, die, entf, hrung, aus, dem, serail, from, mozart, the, young, ludwig, van, beethoven, was, commissioned, to, write, a, funeral, cantata, for, him, but, it, was, not, performed, because, of, its, technical, difficulty, joseph, is, prominently, featured, in, peter, shaffer, s, play, amadeus, and, the, movie, based, upon, it, in, the, film, version, he, is, portrayed, by, actor, jeffrey, jones, as, a, well, meaning, but, somewhat, befuddled, monarch, of, limited, but, enthusiastic, musical, skill, easily, manipulated, by, salieri, however, shaffer, has, made, it, clear, his, play, is, fiction, in, many, respects, and, not, intended, to, portray, historical, reality, joseph, was, portrayed, by, danny, huston, in, the, 2006, film, marie, antoinette, joseph, also, converted, vienna, s, defensive, glacis, into, public, park, the, linienwall, defending, vienna, s, historic, center, were, surrounded, by, a, ditch, and, glacis, about, 500m, wide, which, were, kept, clear, of, vegetation, and, buildings, for, defensive, purposes, under, joseph, the, ditch, was, filled, and, carriage, drives, and, walkways, were, built, through, the, glacis, and, the, area, planted, with, ornamental, trees, and, provided, with, lanterns, and, benches, this, green, public, space, persisted, until, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, when, the, ringstrasse, and, its, associated, buildings, were, built, there
