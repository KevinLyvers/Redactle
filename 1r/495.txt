consensus, among, biographers, of, britten, is, that, his, father, was, a, loving, but, somewhat, stern, and, remote, parent, britten, according, to, his, sister, beth, got, on, well, with, him, and, shared, his, wry, sense, of, humour, dedication, to, work, and, capacity, for, taking, pains, edith, britten, was, a, talented, amateur, musician, and, secretary, of, the, lowestoft, musical, society, in, the, english, provinces, of, the, early, 20th, century, distinctions, of, social, class, were, taken, very, seriously, britten, described, his, family, as, very, ordinary, middle, class, but, there, were, aspects, of, the, brittens, that, were, not, ordinary, edith, s, father, was, illegitimate, and, her, mother, was, an, alcoholic, robert, britten, was, an, agnostic, and, refused, to, attend, church, on, sundays, music, was, the, principal, means, by, which, edith, britten, strove, to, maintain, the, family, s, social, standing, inviting, the, pillars, of, the, local, community, to, musical, soir, es, at, the, house, when, britten, was, three, months, old, he, contracted, pneumonia, and, nearly, died, the, illness, left, him, with, a, damaged, heart, and, doctors, warned, his, parents, that, he, would, probably, never, be, able, to, lead, a, normal, life, he, recovered, more, fully, than, expected, and, as, a, boy, was, a, keen, tennis, player, and, cricketer, to, his, mother, s, great, delight, he, was, an, outstandingly, musical, child, unlike, his, sisters, who, inherited, their, father, s, indifference, to, music, while, his, brother, robert, though, musically, talented, was, interested, only, in, ragtime, edith, gave, the, young, britten, his, first, lessons, in, piano, and, notation, he, made, his, first, attempts, at, composition, when, he, was, five, he, started, piano, lessons, when, he, was, seven, years, old, and, three, years, later, began, to, play, the, viola, he, was, one, of, the, last, composers, brought, up, on, exclusively, live, music, his, father, refused, to, have, a, gramophone, or, later, a, radio, in, the, house, when, he, was, seven, britten, was, sent, to, a, dame, school, run, by, the, misses, astle, the, younger, sister, ethel, gave, him, piano, lessons, in, later, life, he, said, that, he, remained, grateful, for, the, excellence, of, her, teaching, the, following, year, he, moved, on, to, a, prep, school, south, lodge, lowestoft, as, a, day, boy, the, headmaster, thomas, sewell, was, an, old, fashioned, disciplinarian, the, young, britten, was, outraged, at, the, severe, corporal, punishments, frequently, handed, out, and, later, he, said, that, his, lifelong, pacifism, probably, had, its, roots, in, his, reaction, to, the, regime, at, the, school, he, himself, rarely, fell, foul, of, sewell, a, mathematician, in, which, subject, britten, was, a, star, pupil, the, school, had, no, musical, tradition, and, britten, continued, to, study, the, piano, with, ethel, astle, from, the, age, of, ten, he, took, viola, lessons, from, a, friend, of, his, mother, audrey, alston, who, had, been, a, professional, player, before, her, marriage, in, his, spare, time, he, composed, prolifically, when, his, simple, symphony, based, on, these, juvenilia, was, recorded, in, 1956, britten, wrote, this, pen, portrait, of, his, young, self, for, the, sleeve, note, once, upon, a, time, there, was, a, prep, school, boy, he, was, quite, an, ordinary, little, boy, he, loved, cricket, only, quite, liked, football, although, he, kicked, a, pretty, corner, he, adored, mathematics, got, on, all, right, with, history, was, scared, by, latin, unseen, he, behaved, fairly, well, only, ragged, the, recognised, amount, so, that, his, contacts, with, the, cane, or, the, slipper, were, happily, rare, although, one, nocturnal, expedition, to, stalk, ghosts, left, its, marks, behind, he, worked, his, way, up, the, school, slowly, and, steadily, until, at, the, age, of, thirteen, he, reached, that, pinnacle, of, importance, and, grandeur, never, to, be, quite, equalled, in, later, days, the, head, of, the, sixth, head, prefect, and, victor, ludorum, but, there, was, one, curious, thing, about, this, boy, he, wrote, music, his, friends, bore, with, it, his, enemies, kicked, a, bit, but, not, for, long, he, was, quite, tough, the, staff, couldn, t, object, if, his, work, and, games, didn, t, suffer, he, wrote, lots, of, it, reams, and, reams, of, it, audrey, alston, encouraged, britten, to, go, to, symphony, concerts, in, norwich, at, one, of, these, during, the, triennial, norfolk, and, norwich, festival, in, october, 1924, he, heard, frank, bridge, s, orchestral, poem, the, sea, conducted, by, the, composer, it, was, the, first, substantial, piece, of, modern, music, he, had, ever, encountered, and, he, was, in, his, own, phrase, knocked, sideways, by, it, audrey, alston, was, a, friend, of, bridge, when, he, returned, to, norwich, for, the, next, festival, in, 1927, she, brought, her, not, quite, 14, year, old, pupil, to, meet, him, bridge, was, impressed, with, the, boy, and, after, they, had, gone, through, some, of, britten, s, compositions, together, he, invited, him, to, come, to, london, to, take, lessons, from, him, robert, britten, supported, by, thomas, sewell, doubted, the, wisdom, of, pursuing, a, composing, career, a, compromise, was, agreed, by, which, britten, would, as, planned, go, on, to, his, public, school, the, following, year, but, would, make, regular, day, trips, to, london, to, study, composition, with, bridge, and, piano, with, his, colleague, harold, samuel, bridge, impressed, on, britten, the, importance, of, scrupulous, attention, to, the, technical, craft, of, composing, and, the, maxim, that, you, should, find, yourself, and, be, true, to, what, you, found, the, earliest, substantial, works, britten, composed, while, studying, with, bridge, are, the, string, quartet, in, f, completed, in, april, 1928, and, the, quatre, chansons, fran, aises, a, song, cycle, for, high, voice, and, orchestra, authorities, differ, on, the, extent, of, bridge, s, influence, on, his, pupil, s, technique, humphrey, carpenter, and, michael, oliver, judge, that, britten, s, abilities, as, an, orchestrator, were, essentially, self, taught, donald, mitchell, considers, that, bridge, had, an, important, influence, on, the, cycle, in, september, 1928, britten, went, as, a, boarder, to, gresham, s, school, in, holt, norfolk, at, the, time, he, felt, unhappy, there, even, writing, in, his, diary, of, contemplating, suicide, or, running, away, he, hated, being, separated, from, his, family, most, particularly, from, his, mother, he, despised, the, music, master, and, he, was, shocked, at, the, prevalence, of, bullying, though, he, was, not, the, target, of, it, he, remained, there, for, two, years, and, in, 1930, he, won, a, composition, scholarship, at, the, royal, college, of, music, rcm, in, london, his, examiners, were, the, composers, john, ireland, and, ralph, vaughan, williams, and, the, college, s, harmony, and, counterpoint, teacher, s, p, waddington, britten, was, at, the, rcm, from, 1930, to, 1933, studying, composition, with, ireland, and, piano, with, arthur, benjamin, he, won, the, sullivan, prize, for, composition, the, cobbett, competition, for, chamber, music, and, was, twice, winner, of, the, ernest, farrar, prize, for, composition, despite, these, honours, he, was, not, greatly, impressed, by, the, establishment, he, found, his, fellow, students, amateurish, and, folksy, and, the, staff, inclined, to, suspect, technical, brilliance, of, being, superficial, and, insincere, another, ireland, pupil, the, composer, humphrey, searle, said, that, ireland, could, be, an, inspiring, teacher, to, those, on, his, own, wavelength, britten, was, not, and, learned, little, from, him, he, continued, to, study, privately, with, bridge, although, he, later, praised, ireland, for, nurs, me, very, gently, through, a, very, very, difficult, musical, adolescence, britten, also, used, his, time, in, london, to, attend, concerts, and, become, better, acquainted, with, the, music, of, stravinsky, shostakovich, and, most, particularly, mahler, he, intended, postgraduate, study, in, vienna, with, alban, berg, arnold, schoenberg, s, student, but, was, eventually, dissuaded, by, his, parents, on, the, advice, of, the, rcm, staff, the, first, of, britten, s, compositions, to, attract, wide, attention, were, composed, while, at, the, rcm, the, sinfonietta, op, 1, 1932, the, oboe, quartet, phantasy, op, 2, dedicated, to, l, on, goossens, who, played, the, first, performance, in, a, bbc, broadcast, on, 6, august, 1933, and, a, set, of, choral, variations, a, boy, was, born, written, in, 1933, for, the, bbc, singers, who, first, performed, it, the, following, year, in, this, same, period, he, wrote, friday, afternoons, a, collection, of, 12, songs, for, the, pupils, of, clive, house, school, prestatyn, where, his, brother, was, headmaster, in, february, 1935, at, bridge, s, instigation, britten, was, invited, to, a, job, interview, by, the, bbc, s, director, of, music, adrian, boult, and, his, assistant, edward, clark, britten, was, not, enthusiastic, about, the, prospect, of, working, full, time, in, the, bbc, music, department, and, was, relieved, when, what, came, out, of, the, interview, was, an, invitation, to, write, the, score, for, a, documentary, film, the, king, s, stamp, directed, by, alberto, cavalcanti, for, the, gpo, film, unit, britten, became, a, member, of, the, film, unit, s, small, group, of, regular, contributors, another, of, whom, was, w, h, auden, together, they, worked, on, the, documentary, films, coal, face, and, night, mail, in, 1935, they, also, collaborated, on, the, song, cycle, our, hunting, fathers, 1936, radical, both, in, politics, and, musical, treatment, and, subsequently, other, works, including, cabaret, songs, on, this, island, paul, bunyan, and, hymn, to, st, cecilia, auden, was, a, considerable, influence, on, britten, encouraging, him, to, widen, his, aesthetic, intellectual, and, political, horizons, and, also, to, come, to, terms, with, his, homosexuality, auden, was, as, david, matthews, puts, it, cheerfully, and, guiltlessly, promiscuous, britten, puritanical, and, conventional, by, nature, was, sexually, repressed, in, the, three, years, from, 1935, to, 1937, britten, wrote, nearly, 40, scores, for, the, theatre, cinema, and, radio, among, the, film, music, of, the, late, 1930s, matthews, singles, out, night, mail, and, love, from, a, stranger, 1937, from, the, theatre, music, he, selects, for, mention, the, ascent, of, f6, 1936, on, the, frontier, 1938, and, johnson, over, jordan, 1939, and, of, the, music, for, radio, king, arthur, 1937, and, the, sword, in, the, stone, 1939, in, 1937, there, were, two, events, of, huge, importance, in, britten, s, life, his, mother, died, and, he, met, the, tenor, peter, pears, although, britten, was, extraordinarily, devoted, to, his, mother, and, was, devastated, at, her, death, it, also, seems, to, have, been, something, of, a, liberation, for, him, only, after, that, did, he, begin, to, engage, in, emotional, relationships, with, people, his, own, age, or, younger, later, in, the, year, he, got, to, know, pears, while, they, were, both, helping, to, clear, out, the, country, cottage, of, a, mutual, friend, who, had, died, in, an, air, crash, pears, quickly, became, britten, s, musical, inspiration, and, close, though, for, the, moment, platonic, friend, britten, s, first, work, for, him, was, composed, within, weeks, of, their, meeting, a, setting, of, emily, bront, s, poem, a, thousand, gleaming, fires, for, tenor, and, strings, during, 1937, britten, composed, a, pacifist, march, to, words, by, ronald, duncan, for, the, peace, pledge, union, of, which, as, a, pacifist, he, had, become, an, active, member, the, work, was, not, a, success, and, was, soon, withdrawn, the, best, known, of, his, compositions, from, this, period, is, probably, variations, on, a, theme, of, frank, bridge, for, string, orchestra, described, by, matthews, as, the, first, of, britten, s, works, to, become, a, popular, classic, it, was, a, success, in, north, america, with, performances, in, toronto, new, york, boston, chicago, and, san, francisco, under, conductors, including, john, barbirolli, and, serge, koussevitzky, in, april, 1939, britten, and, pears, sailed, to, north, america, going, first, to, canada, and, then, to, new, york, they, had, several, reasons, for, leaving, england, including, the, difficult, position, of, pacifists, in, an, increasingly, bellicose, europe, the, success, that, frank, bridge, had, enjoyed, in, the, us, the, departure, of, auden, and, his, friend, christopher, isherwood, to, the, us, from, england, three, months, previously, hostile, or, belittling, reviews, of, britten, s, music, in, the, english, press, and, under, rehearsed, and, inadequate, performances, britten, and, pears, consummated, their, relationship, and, from, then, until, britten, s, death, they, were, partners, in, both, their, professional, and, personal, lives, when, the, second, world, war, began, britten, and, pears, turned, for, advice, to, the, british, embassy, in, washington, and, were, told, that, they, should, remain, in, the, us, as, artistic, ambassadors, pears, was, inclined, to, disregard, the, advice, and, go, back, to, england, britten, also, felt, the, urge, to, return, but, accepted, the, embassy, s, counsel, and, persuaded, pears, to, do, the, same, already, a, friend, of, the, composer, aaron, copland, britten, encountered, his, latest, works, billy, the, kid, and, an, outdoor, overture, both, of, which, influenced, his, own, music, in, 1940, britten, composed, seven, sonnets, of, michelangelo, the, first, of, many, song, cycles, for, pears, britten, s, orchestral, works, from, this, period, include, the, violin, concerto, and, sinfonia, da, requiem, in, 1941, britten, produced, his, first, music, drama, paul, bunyan, an, operetta, to, a, libretto, by, auden, while, in, the, us, britten, had, his, first, encounter, with, balinese, gamelan, music, through, transcriptions, for, piano, duo, made, by, the, canadian, composer, colin, mcphee, the, two, met, in, the, summer, of, 1939, and, subsequently, performed, a, number, of, mcphee, s, transcriptions, for, a, recording, this, musical, encounter, bore, fruit, in, several, balinese, inspired, works, later, in, britten, s, career, moving, to, the, us, did, not, relieve, britten, of, the, nuisance, of, hostile, criticism, although, olin, downes, the, doyen, of, new, york, music, critics, and, irving, kolodin, took, to, britten, s, music, virgil, thomson, was, as, the, music, scholar, suzanne, robinson, puts, it, consistently, severe, and, spiteful, thomson, described, les, illuminations, 1940, as, little, more, than, a, series, of, bromidic, and, facile, effects, pretentious, banal, and, utterly, disappointing, and, was, equally, unflattering, about, pears, s, voice, robinson, surmises, that, thomson, was, motivated, by, a, mixture, of, spite, national, pride, and, professional, jealousy, paul, bunyan, met, with, wholesale, critical, disapproval, and, the, sinfonia, da, requiem, already, rejected, by, its, japanese, sponsors, because, of, its, overtly, christian, nature, received, a, mixed, reception, when, barbirolli, and, the, new, york, philharmonic, premiered, it, in, march, 1941, the, reputation, of, the, work, was, much, enhanced, when, koussevitzky, took, it, up, shortly, afterwards, in, 1942, britten, read, the, work, of, the, poet, george, crabbe, for, the, first, time, the, borough, set, on, the, suffolk, coast, close, to, britten, s, homeland, awakened, in, him, such, longings, for, england, that, he, knew, he, must, return, he, also, knew, that, he, must, write, an, opera, based, on, crabbe, s, poem, about, the, fisherman, peter, grimes, before, britten, left, the, us, koussevitzky, always, generous, in, encouraging, new, talent, offered, him, a, 1, 000, commission, to, write, the, opera, britten, and, pears, returned, to, england, in, april, 1942, during, the, long, transatlantic, sea, crossing, britten, completed, the, choral, works, a, ceremony, of, carols, and, hymn, to, st, cecilia, the, latter, was, his, last, large, scale, collaboration, with, auden, britten, had, grown, away, from, him, and, auden, became, one, of, the, composer, s, so, called, corpses, former, intimates, from, whom, he, completely, cut, off, contact, once, they, had, outlived, their, usefulness, to, him, or, offended, him, in, some, way, having, arrived, in, britain, britten, and, pears, applied, for, recognition, as, conscientious, objectors, britten, was, initially, allowed, only, non, combatant, service, in, the, military, but, on, appeal, he, gained, unconditional, exemption, after, the, death, of, his, mother, in, 1937, he, had, used, money, she, bequeathed, him, to, buy, the, old, mill, in, snape, suffolk, which, became, his, country, home, he, spent, much, of, his, time, there, in, 1944, working, on, the, opera, peter, grimes, pears, joined, sadler, s, wells, opera, company, whose, artistic, director, the, singer, joan, cross, announced, her, intention, to, re, open, the, company, s, home, base, in, london, with, britten, s, opera, casting, herself, and, pears, in, the, leading, roles, there, were, complaints, from, company, members, about, supposed, favouritism, and, the, cacophony, of, britten, s, score, as, well, as, some, ill, suppressed, homophobic, remarks, peter, grimes, opened, in, june, 1945, and, was, hailed, by, public, and, critics, its, box, office, takings, matched, or, exceeded, those, for, la, boh, me, and, madame, butterfly, which, were, staged, during, the, same, season, the, opera, administrator, lord, harewood, called, it, the, first, genuinely, successful, british, opera, gilbert, and, sullivan, apart, since, purcell, dismayed, by, the, in, fighting, among, the, company, cross, britten, and, pears, severed, their, ties, with, sadler, s, wells, in, december, 1945, going, on, to, found, what, was, to, become, the, english, opera, group, a, month, after, the, opening, of, peter, grimes, britten, and, yehudi, menuhin, went, to, germany, to, give, recitals, to, concentration, camp, survivors, what, they, saw, at, belsen, most, of, all, so, shocked, britten, that, he, refused, to, talk, about, it, until, towards, the, end, of, his, life, when, he, told, pears, that, it, had, coloured, everything, he, had, written, since, colin, matthews, comments, that, the, next, two, works, britten, composed, after, his, return, the, song, cycle, the, holy, sonnets, of, john, donne, and, the, second, string, quartet, contrast, strongly, with, earlier, lighter, hearted, works, such, as, les, illuminations, britten, recovered, his, joie, de, vivre, for, the, young, person, s, guide, to, the, orchestra, 1945, written, for, an, educational, film, instruments, of, the, orchestra, directed, by, muir, mathieson, and, featuring, the, london, symphony, orchestra, conducted, by, malcolm, sargent, it, became, and, remained, his, most, often, played, and, popular, work, britten, s, next, opera, the, rape, of, lucretia, was, presented, at, the, first, post, war, glyndebourne, festival, in, 1946, it, was, then, taken, on, tour, to, provincial, cities, under, the, banner, of, the, glyndebourne, english, opera, company, an, uneasy, alliance, of, britten, and, his, associates, with, john, christie, the, autocratic, proprietor, of, glyndebourne, the, tour, lost, money, heavily, and, christie, announced, that, he, would, underwrite, no, more, tours, britten, and, his, associates, set, up, the, english, opera, group, the, librettist, eric, crozier, and, the, designer, john, piper, joined, britten, as, artistic, directors, the, group, s, express, purpose, was, to, produce, and, commission, new, english, operas, and, other, works, presenting, them, throughout, the, country, britten, wrote, the, comic, opera, albert, herring, for, the, group, in, 1947, while, on, tour, in, the, new, work, pears, came, up, with, the, idea, of, mounting, a, festival, in, the, small, suffolk, seaside, town, of, aldeburgh, where, britten, had, moved, from, snape, earlier, in, the, year, and, which, became, his, principal, place, of, residence, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, aldeburgh, festival, was, launched, in, june, 1948, with, britten, pears, and, crozier, directing, albert, herring, played, at, the, jubilee, hall, and, britten, s, new, cantata, for, tenor, chorus, and, orchestra, saint, nicolas, was, presented, in, the, parish, church, the, festival, was, an, immediate, success, and, became, an, annual, event, that, has, continued, into, the, 21st, century, new, works, by, britten, featured, in, almost, every, festival, until, his, death, in, 1976, including, the, premieres, of, his, operas, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, at, the, jubilee, hall, in, 1960, and, death, in, venice, at, snape, maltings, concert, hall, in, 1973, unlike, many, leading, english, composers, britten, was, not, known, as, a, teacher, but, in, 1949, he, accepted, his, only, private, pupil, arthur, oldham, who, studied, with, him, for, three, years, oldham, made, himself, useful, acting, as, musical, assistant, and, arranging, variations, on, a, theme, by, frank, bridge, for, full, orchestra, for, the, frederick, ashton, ballet, le, r, ve, de, l, onor, 1949, but, he, later, described, the, teacher, pupil, relationship, as, beneficial, five, per, cent, to, and, ninety, five, per, cent, to, me, throughout, the, 1950s, britten, continued, to, write, operas, billy, budd, 1951, was, well, received, at, its, covent, garden, premiere, and, was, regarded, by, reviewers, as, an, advance, on, peter, grimes, gloriana, 1953, written, to, mark, the, coronation, of, elizabeth, ii, had, a, cool, reception, at, the, gala, premiere, in, the, presence, of, the, queen, and, the, british, establishment, en, masse, the, downbeat, story, of, elizabeth, i, in, her, decline, and, britten, s, score, reportedly, thought, by, members, of, the, premiere, s, audience, too, modern, for, such, a, gala, did, not, overcome, what, matthews, calls, the, ingrained, philistinism, of, the, ruling, classes, although, gloriana, did, well, at, the, box, office, there, were, no, further, productions, in, britain, for, another, 13, years, it, was, later, recognised, as, one, of, britten, s, finer, operas, the, turn, of, the, screw, the, following, year, was, an, unqualified, success, together, with, peter, grimes, it, became, and, at, 2013, remained, one, of, the, two, most, frequently, performed, of, britten, s, operas, in, the, 1950s, the, fervently, anti, homosexual, home, secretary, sir, david, maxwell, fyfe, urged, the, police, to, enforce, the, victorian, laws, making, homosexual, acts, illegal, britten, and, pears, came, under, scrutiny, britten, was, visited, by, police, officers, in, 1953, and, was, so, perturbed, that, he, discussed, with, his, assistant, imogen, holst, the, possibility, that, pears, might, have, to, enter, a, sham, marriage, with, whom, is, unclear, in, the, end, nothing, was, done, an, increasingly, important, influence, on, britten, was, the, music, of, the, east, an, interest, that, was, fostered, by, a, tour, there, with, pears, in, 1956, when, britten, once, again, encountered, the, music, of, the, balinese, gamelan, and, saw, for, the, first, time, japanese, noh, plays, which, he, called, some, of, the, most, wonderful, drama, i, have, ever, seen, these, eastern, influences, were, seen, and, heard, in, the, ballet, the, prince, of, the, pagodas, 1957, and, later, in, two, of, the, three, semi, operatic, parables, for, church, performance, curlew, river, 1964, the, burning, fiery, furnace, 1966, and, the, prodigal, son, 1968, by, the, 1960s, the, aldeburgh, festival, was, outgrowing, its, customary, venues, and, plans, to, build, a, new, concert, hall, in, aldeburgh, were, not, progressing, when, redundant, victorian, maltings, buildings, in, the, village, of, snape, six, miles, inland, became, available, for, hire, britten, realised, that, the, largest, of, them, could, be, converted, into, a, concert, hall, and, opera, house, the, 830, seat, snape, maltings, hall, was, opened, by, the, queen, at, the, start, of, the, twentieth, aldeburgh, festival, on, 2, june, 1967, it, was, immediately, hailed, as, one, of, the, best, concert, halls, in, the, country, the, hall, was, destroyed, by, fire, in, 1969, but, britten, was, determined, that, it, would, be, rebuilt, in, time, for, the, following, year, s, festival, which, it, was, the, queen, again, attended, the, opening, performance, in, 1970, the, maltings, gave, the, festival, a, venue, that, could, comfortably, house, large, orchestral, works, and, operas, britten, conducted, the, first, performance, outside, russia, of, shostakovich, s, fourteenth, symphony, at, snape, in, 1970, shostakovich, a, friend, since, 1960, dedicated, the, symphony, to, britten, he, was, himself, the, dedicatee, of, the, prodigal, son, two, other, russian, musicians, who, were, close, to, britten, and, regularly, performed, at, the, festival, were, the, pianist, sviatoslav, richter, and, the, cellist, mstislav, rostropovich, britten, composed, his, cello, suites, cello, symphony, and, cello, sonata, for, rostropovich, who, premiered, them, at, the, aldeburgh, festival, one, of, the, best, known, of, britten, s, works, the, war, requiem, was, premiered, in, 1962, he, had, been, asked, four, years, earlier, to, write, a, work, for, the, consecration, of, the, new, coventry, cathedral, a, modernist, building, designed, by, basil, spence, the, old, cathedral, had, been, left, in, ruins, by, an, air, raid, on, the, city, in, 1940, in, which, hundreds, of, people, died, britten, decided, that, his, work, would, commemorate, the, dead, of, both, world, wars, in, a, large, scale, score, for, soloists, chorus, chamber, ensemble, and, orchestra, his, text, interspersed, the, traditional, requiem, mass, with, poems, by, wilfred, owen, matthews, writes, with, the, war, requiem, britten, reached, the, apex, of, his, reputation, it, was, almost, universally, hailed, as, a, masterpiece, shostakovich, told, rostropovich, that, he, believed, it, to, be, the, greatest, work, of, the, twentieth, century, in, 1967, the, bbc, commissioned, britten, to, write, an, opera, specially, for, television, owen, wingrave, was, based, like, the, turn, of, the, screw, on, a, ghost, story, by, henry, james, by, the, 1960s, britten, found, composition, much, slower, than, in, his, prolific, youth, he, told, the, 28, year, old, composer, nicholas, maw, get, as, much, done, now, as, you, can, because, it, gets, much, much, more, difficult, as, you, grow, older, he, did, not, complete, the, score, of, the, new, opera, until, august, 1970, owen, wingrave, was, first, broadcast, in, britain, in, may, 1971, when, it, was, also, televised, in, austria, belgium, denmark, france, germany, ireland, the, netherlands, norway, sweden, switzerland, the, us, and, yugoslavia, in, september, 1970, britten, asked, myfanwy, piper, who, had, adapted, the, two, henry, james, stories, for, him, to, turn, another, prose, story, into, a, libretto, this, was, thomas, mann, s, novella, death, in, venice, a, subject, he, had, been, considering, for, some, time, at, an, early, stage, in, composition, britten, was, told, by, his, doctors, that, a, heart, operation, was, essential, if, he, was, to, live, for, more, than, two, years, he, was, determined, to, finish, the, opera, and, worked, urgently, to, complete, it, before, going, into, hospital, for, surgery, his, long, term, colleague, colin, graham, wrote, perhaps, of, all, his, works, this, one, went, deepest, into, britten, s, own, soul, there, are, extraordinary, cross, currents, of, affinity, between, himself, his, own, state, of, health, and, mind, thomas, mann, aschenbach, mann, s, dying, protagonist, and, peter, pears, who, must, have, had, to, tear, himself, in, three, in, order, to, reconstitute, himself, as, the, principal, character, after, the, completion, of, the, opera, britten, went, into, the, national, heart, hospital, and, was, operated, on, in, may, 1973, to, replace, a, failing, heart, valve, the, replacement, was, successful, but, he, suffered, a, slight, stroke, affecting, his, right, hand, this, brought, his, career, as, a, performer, to, an, end, while, in, hospital, britten, became, friendly, with, a, senior, nursing, sister, rita, thomson, she, moved, to, aldeburgh, in, 1974, and, looked, after, him, until, his, death, britten, s, last, works, include, the, suite, on, english, folk, tunes, a, time, there, was, 1974, the, third, string, quartet, 1975, which, drew, on, material, from, death, in, venice, and, the, dramatic, cantata, phaedra, 1975, written, for, janet, baker, in, june, 1976, the, last, year, of, his, life, britten, accepted, a, life, peerage, the, first, composer, so, honoured, becoming, baron, britten, of, aldeburgh, in, the, county, of, suffolk, after, the, 1976, aldeburgh, festival, britten, and, pears, travelled, to, norway, where, britten, began, writing, praise, we, great, men, for, voices, and, orchestra, based, on, a, poem, by, edith, sitwell, he, returned, to, aldeburgh, in, august, and, wrote, welcome, ode, for, children, s, choir, and, orchestra, in, november, britten, realised, that, he, could, no, longer, compose, on, his, 63rd, birthday, 22, november, at, his, request, rita, thomson, organised, a, champagne, party, and, invited, his, friends, and, his, sisters, barbara, and, beth, to, say, their, goodbyes, to, the, dying, composer, when, rostropovich, made, his, farewell, visit, a, few, days, later, britten, gave, him, what, he, had, written, of, praise, we, great, men, i, heard, of, his, death, and, took, a, long, walk, in, total, silence, through, gently, falling, snow, across, a, frozen, lake, which, corresponded, exactly, to, the, inexpressible, sense, of, numbness, at, such, a, loss, the, world, is, colder, and, lonelier, without, the, presence, of, our, supreme, creator, of, music, peter, maxwell, davies, 1977, britten, died, of, congestive, heart, failure, on, 4, december, 1976, his, funeral, service, was, held, at, aldeburgh, parish, church, three, days, later, and, he, was, buried, in, its, churchyard, with, a, gravestone, carved, by, reynolds, stone, the, authorities, at, westminster, abbey, had, offered, burial, there, but, britten, had, made, it, clear, that, he, wished, his, grave, to, be, side, by, side, with, that, in, due, course, of, pears, a, memorial, service, was, held, at, the, abbey, on, 10, march, 1977, at, which, the, congregation, was, headed, by, queen, elizabeth, the, queen, mother, despite, his, large, number, of, works, on, christian, themes, britten, has, sometimes, been, thought, of, as, an, agnostic, pears, said, that, when, they, met, in, 1937, he, was, not, sure, whether, or, not, britten, would, have, described, himself, as, a, christian, in, the, 1960s, britten, called, himself, a, dedicated, christian, though, sympathetic, to, the, radical, views, propounded, by, the, bishop, of, woolwich, in, honest, to, god, politically, britten, was, on, the, left, he, told, pears, that, he, always, voted, either, liberal, or, labour, and, could, not, imagine, ever, voting, conservative, but, he, was, never, a, member, of, any, party, except, the, peace, pledge, union, physically, britten, was, never, robust, he, walked, and, swam, regularly, and, kept, himself, as, fit, as, he, could, but, in, his, 1992, biography, carpenter, mentions, 20, illnesses, a, few, of, them, minor, but, most, fairly, serious, suffered, over, the, years, by, britten, before, his, final, heart, complaint, developed, emotionally, according, to, some, commentators, britten, never, completely, grew, up, retaining, in, his, outlook, something, of, a, child, s, view, of, the, world, he, was, not, always, confident, that, he, was, the, genius, others, declared, him, to, be, and, though, he, was, hypercritical, of, his, own, works, he, was, acutely, even, aggressively, sensitive, to, criticism, from, anybody, else, britten, was, as, he, himself, acknowledged, notorious, for, dumping, friends, and, colleagues, who, either, offended, him, or, ceased, to, be, of, use, to, him, his, corpses, the, conductor, sir, charles, mackerras, believed, that, the, term, was, invented, by, lord, harewood, both, mackerras, and, harewood, joined, the, list, of, corpses, the, former, for, joking, that, the, number, of, boys, in, noye, s, fludde, must, have, been, a, delight, to, the, composer, and, the, latter, for, an, extramarital, affair, and, subsequent, divorce, from, lady, harewood, which, shocked, the, puritanical, britten, among, other, corpses, were, his, librettists, montagu, slater, and, eric, crozier, the, latter, said, in, 1949, he, has, sometimes, told, me, jokingly, that, one, day, i, would, join, the, ranks, of, his, corpses, and, i, have, always, recognized, that, any, ordinary, person, must, soon, outlive, his, usefulness, to, such, a, great, creative, artist, as, ben, dame, janet, baker, said, in, 1981, i, think, he, was, quite, entitled, to, take, what, he, wanted, from, others, he, did, not, want, to, hurt, anyone, but, the, task, in, hand, was, more, important, than, anything, or, anybody, matthews, feels, that, this, aspect, of, britten, has, been, exaggerated, and, he, observes, that, the, composer, sustained, many, deep, friendships, to, the, end, of, his, life, throughout, his, adult, life, britten, had, a, particular, rapport, with, children, and, enjoyed, close, friendships, with, several, boys, particularly, those, in, their, early, teens, the, first, such, friendship, was, with, piers, dunkerley, who, was, 13, years, old, in, 1934, when, britten, was, aged, 20, other, boys, britten, befriended, were, the, young, david, hemmings, and, michael, crawford, both, of, whom, sang, treble, roles, in, his, works, in, the, 1950s, hemmings, later, said, in, all, of, the, time, that, i, spent, with, him, he, never, abused, that, trust, and, crawford, wrote, i, cannot, say, enough, about, the, kindness, of, that, great, man, he, had, a, wonderful, patience, and, affinity, with, young, people, he, loved, music, and, loved, youngsters, caring, about, music, it, was, long, suspected, by, several, of, britten, s, close, associates, that, there, was, something, exceptional, about, his, attraction, to, teenage, boys, auden, referred, to, britten, s, attraction, to, thin, as, a, board, juveniles, to, the, sexless, and, innocent, and, pears, once, wrote, to, britten, remember, there, are, lovely, things, in, the, world, still, children, boys, sunshine, the, sea, mozart, you, and, me, in, public, the, matter, was, little, discussed, during, britten, s, lifetime, and, much, discussed, after, it, carpenter, s, 1992, biography, closely, examined, the, evidence, as, do, later, studies, of, britten, most, particularly, john, bridcut, s, britten, s, children, 2006, which, concentrates, on, britten, s, friendships, and, relationships, with, various, children, and, adolescents, some, commentators, have, continued, to, question, britten, s, conduct, sometimes, very, sharply, carpenter, and, bridcut, conclude, that, he, held, any, sexual, impulses, under, firm, control, and, kept, the, relationships, affectionate, including, bed, sharing, kissing, and, nude, bathing, but, strictly, platonic, a, more, recent, controversy, was, the, statement, in, a, 2013, biography, of, britten, by, paul, kildea, that, the, composer, s, heart, failure, was, due, to, undetected, syphilis, which, kildea, speculates, was, a, result, of, pears, s, promiscuity, while, the, two, were, living, in, new, york, in, response, britten, s, consultant, cardiologist, said, that, like, all, the, hospital, s, similar, cases, britten, was, routinely, screened, for, syphilis, before, the, operation, with, negative, results, he, described, as, complete, rubbish, kildea, s, allegation, that, the, surgeon, who, operated, on, britten, in, 1973, would, or, even, could, have, covered, up, a, syphilitic, condition, kildea, continued, to, maintain, when, all, the, composer, s, symptoms, are, considered, there, can, be, only, one, cause, in, the, times, richard, morrison, praised, the, rest, of, kildea, s, book, and, hoped, that, its, reputation, would, not, be, tarnished, by, one, sensational, speculation, some, second, hand, hearsay, presenting, unsubstantiated, gossip, as, fact, britten, s, early, musical, life, was, dominated, by, the, classical, masters, his, mother, s, ambition, was, for, him, to, become, the, fourth, b, after, bach, beethoven, and, brahms, britten, was, later, to, assert, that, his, initial, development, as, a, composer, was, stifled, by, reverence, for, these, masters, between, the, ages, of, thirteen, and, sixteen, i, knew, every, note, of, beethoven, and, brahms, i, remember, receiving, the, full, score, of, fidelio, for, my, fourteenth, birthday, but, i, think, in, a, sense, i, never, forgave, them, for, having, led, me, astray, in, my, own, particular, thinking, and, natural, inclinations, he, developed, a, particular, animosity, towards, brahms, whose, piano, music, he, had, once, held, in, great, esteem, in, 1952, he, confided, that, he, played, through, all, brahms, s, music, from, time, to, time, to, see, if, i, am, right, about, him, i, usually, find, that, i, underestimated, last, time, how, bad, it, was, through, his, association, with, frank, bridge, britten, s, musical, horizons, expanded, he, discovered, the, music, of, debussy, and, ravel, which, matthews, writes, gave, him, a, model, for, an, orchestral, sound, bridge, also, led, britten, to, the, music, of, schoenberg, and, berg, the, latter, s, death, in, 1935, affected, britten, deeply, a, letter, at, that, time, reveals, his, thoughts, on, the, contemporary, music, scene, the, real, musicians, are, so, few, far, between, aren, t, they, apart, from, the, bergs, stravinskys, schoenbergs, bridges, one, is, a, bit, stumped, for, names, isn, t, one, adding, as, an, afterthought, shostakovitch, perhaps, possibly, by, this, time, britten, had, developed, a, lasting, hostility, towards, the, english, pastoral, school, represented, by, vaughan, williams, and, ireland, whose, work, he, compared, unfavourably, with, the, brilliant, folk, song, arrangements, of, percy, grainger, grainger, became, the, inspiration, of, many, of, britten, s, later, folk, arrangements, britten, was, also, impressed, by, delius, and, thought, brigg, fair, delicious, when, he, heard, it, in, 1931, also, in, that, year, he, heard, stravinsky, s, the, rite, of, spring, which, he, found, bewildering, and, terrifying, yet, at, the, same, time, incredibly, marvellous, and, arresting, the, same, composer, s, symphony, of, psalms, and, petrushka, were, lauded, in, similar, terms, he, and, stravinsky, later, developed, a, mutual, antipathy, informed, by, jealousy, and, mistrust, besides, his, growing, attachments, to, the, works, of, 20th, century, masters, britten, along, with, his, contemporary, michael, tippett, was, devoted, to, the, english, music, of, the, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, centuries, in, particular, the, work, of, purcell, in, defining, his, mission, as, a, composer, of, opera, britten, wrote, one, of, my, chief, aims, is, to, try, to, restore, to, the, musical, setting, of, the, english, language, a, brilliance, freedom, and, vitality, that, have, been, curiously, rare, since, the, death, of, purcell, among, the, closest, of, britten, s, kindred, composer, spirits, even, more, so, than, purcell, was, mahler, whose, fourth, symphony, britten, heard, in, september, 1930, at, that, time, mahler, s, music, was, little, regarded, and, rarely, played, in, english, concert, halls, britten, later, wrote, of, how, the, scoring, of, this, work, impressed, him, entirely, clean, and, transparent, the, material, was, remarkable, and, the, melodic, shapes, highly, original, with, such, rhythmic, and, harmonic, tension, from, beginning, to, end, he, soon, discovered, other, mahler, works, in, particular, das, lied, von, der, erde, he, wrote, to, a, friend, about, the, concluding, abschied, of, das, lied, it, is, cruel, you, know, that, music, should, be, so, beautiful, apart, from, mahler, s, general, influence, on, britten, s, compositional, style, the, incorporation, by, britten, of, popular, tunes, as, for, example, in, death, in, venice, is, a, direct, inheritance, from, the, older, composer, the, britten, pears, foundation, considers, the, composer, s, operas, perhaps, the, most, substantial, and, important, part, of, his, compositional, legacy, britten, s, operas, are, firmly, established, in, the, international, repertoire, according, to, operabase, they, are, performed, worldwide, more, than, those, of, any, other, composer, born, in, the, 20th, century, and, only, puccini, and, richard, strauss, come, ahead, of, him, if, the, list, is, extended, to, all, operas, composed, after, 1900, the, early, operetta, paul, bunyan, stands, apart, from, britten, s, later, operatic, works, philip, brett, calls, it, a, patronizing, attempt, to, evoke, the, spirit, of, a, nation, not, his, own, by, w, h, auden, in, which, britten, was, a, somewhat, dazzled, accomplice, the, american, public, liked, it, but, the, critics, did, not, and, it, fell, into, neglect, until, interest, revived, near, the, end, of, the, composer, s, life, britten, s, subsequent, operas, range, from, large, scale, works, written, for, full, strength, opera, companies, to, chamber, operas, for, performance, by, small, touring, opera, ensembles, or, in, churches, and, schools, in, the, large, scale, category, are, peter, grimes, 1945, billy, budd, 1951, gloriana, 1953, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, 1960, and, death, in, venice, 1973, of, the, remaining, operas, the, rape, of, lucretia, 1946, albert, herring, 1947, the, little, sweep, 1949, and, the, turn, of, the, screw, 1954, were, written, for, small, opera, companies, noye, s, fludde, 1958, curlew, river, 1964, the, burning, fiery, furnace, 1966, and, the, prodigal, son, 1968, were, for, church, performance, and, had, their, premieres, at, st, bartholomew, s, church, orford, the, secular, the, golden, vanity, was, intended, to, be, performed, in, schools, owen, wingrave, written, for, television, was, first, presented, live, by, the, royal, opera, at, covent, garden, in, 1973, two, years, after, its, broadcast, premiere, music, critics, have, frequently, commented, on, the, recurring, theme, in, britten, s, operas, from, peter, grimes, onward, of, the, isolated, individual, at, odds, with, a, hostile, society, the, extent, to, which, this, reflected, britten, s, perception, of, himself, pacifist, and, homosexual, in, the, england, of, the, 1930s, 40s, and, 50s, is, debated, another, recurrent, theme, is, the, corruption, of, innocence, most, sharply, seen, in, the, turn, of, the, screw, over, the, 28, years, between, peter, grimes, and, death, in, venice, britten, s, musical, style, changed, as, he, introduced, elements, of, atonalism, though, remaining, essentially, a, tonal, composer, and, of, eastern, music, particularly, gamelan, sounds, but, also, eastern, harmonies, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, the, orchestral, scoring, varies, to, fit, the, nature, of, each, set, of, characters, the, bright, percussive, sounds, of, harps, keyboards, and, percussion, for, the, fairy, world, warm, strings, and, wind, for, the, pairs, of, lovers, and, lower, woodwind, and, brass, for, the, mechanicals, in, death, in, venice, britten, turns, tadzio, and, his, family, into, silent, dancers, accompanied, by, the, colourful, glittering, sounds, of, tuned, percussion, to, emphasize, their, remoteness, as, early, as, 1948, the, music, analyst, hans, keller, summarising, britten, s, impact, on, 20th, century, opera, to, that, date, compared, his, contribution, to, that, of, mozart, in, the, 18th, century, mozart, may, in, some, respects, be, regarded, as, a, founder, a, second, founder, of, opera, the, same, can, already, be, said, today, as, far, as, the, modern, british, perhaps, not, only, british, field, goes, of, britten, in, addition, to, his, own, original, operas, britten, together, with, imogen, holst, extensively, revised, purcell, s, dido, and, aeneas, 1951, and, the, fairy, queen, 1967, britten, s, purcell,

ostensibly, a, protest, against, fox, hunting, but, which, also, alludes, allegorically, to, the, contemporary, political, state, of, europe, the, work, has, never, been, popular, in, 1948, the, critic, colin, mason, lamented, its, neglect, and, called, it, one, of, britten, s, greatest, works, in, mason, s, view, the, cycle, is, as, exciting, as, les, illuminations, and, offers, many, interesting, and, enjoyable, foretastes, of, the, best, moments, of, his, later, works, the, first, of, britten, s, song, cycles, to, gain, widespread, popularity, was, les, illuminations, 1940, for,

finds, the, sensuality, of, the, verses, it, sets, though, in, its, structure, it, resembles, a, conventional, 19th, century, song, cycle, mason, draws, a, distinction, between, this, and, britten, s, earlier, cycles, because, here, each, song, is, self, contained, and, has, no, thematic, connection, with, any, of, the, others, the, serenade, for, tenor, horn, and, strings, 1943, sets, verses, by, a, variety, of, poets, all, on, the, theme, of, night, time, though, britten, described, the, cycle, as, not, important, stuff, but, quite, pleasant, i, think, it, was, immediately, greeted, as, a, masterpiece, and, together, with, peter, grimes, it, established, him, as, one, of, the, leading, composers, of, his, day, mason, calls, it, a, beautifully, unified, work, on, utterly, dissimilar, poems, held, together, by, the, most, superficial, but, most, effective, and, therefore, most, suitable, symphonic, method, some, of, the, music, is, pure, word, painting, some, of, it, mood, painting, of, the, subtlest, kind, two, years, later, after, witnessing, the, horrors, of, belsen, britten, composed, the, holy, sonnets, of, john, donne, a, work, whose, bleakness, was, not, matched, until, his, final, tenor, and, piano, cycle, a, quarter, of, a, century, later, britten, s, technique, in, this, cycle, ranges, from, atonality, in, the, first, song, to, firm, tonality, later, with,

poets, who, here, include, shakespeare, coleridge, keats, shelley, tennyson, and, wilfred, owen, the, whole, cycle, is, darker, in, tone, than, the, serenade, with, pre, echoes, of, the, war, requiem,

the, best, known, works, in, which, britten, set, poetry, was, the, war, requiem, 1962, it, intersperses, the, latin, requiem, mass, sung, by, soprano, and, chorus, with, settings, of, works, by, the,

paradisum, of, the, mass, matthews, describes, the, conclusion, of, the, work, as, a, great, wave, of, benediction, recalls, the, end, of, the, sinfonia, da, requiem, and, its, similar, ebbing, away, into, the, sea, that, symbolises, both, reconciliation, and, death, the, same, year, he, composed, a, hymn, of, st, columba, for, choir, and, organ, setting, a, poem, by, the, 6th, century, saint,

am, his, is, a, setting, of, francis, quarles, s, 17th, century, poem, a, divine, rapture, and, according, to, britten, was, modelled, on, purcell, s, divine, hymns, matthews, describes, it, as, one, of, the, composer, s, most, serene, works, which, ends, in, a, mood, of, untroubled, happiness, that, would, soon, become, rare, in, britten, s, music, the, second, canticle, was, written, in, 1952, between, billy, budd, and, gloriana, on, the, theme, of, abraham, s, obedience, to, divine, authority, in, the, proffered, sacrifice, of, his, son, isaac, canticle, iii, from, 1954, is, a, setting, of, edith, sitwell, s, wartime, poem, still, falls, the, rain, composed, just, after, the, turn, of, the, screw, with, which, it, is, structurally, and, stylistically, associated, the, twelve, note, cycle, in, the, first, five, bars, of, the, piano, part, of, the, canticle, introduced, a, feature, that, became, thereafter, a, regular, part, of, britten, s, compositional, technique, canticle, iv, the, journey, of, the, magi, premiered, in, 1971, is, based, on, t, s, eliot, s, poem, journey, of, the, magi, it, is, musically, close, to, the, burning, fiery, furnace, of, 1966, matthews, refers, to, it, as, a, companion, piece, to, the, earlier, work, the, final, canticle, was, another, eliot, setting, his, juvenile, poem, death, of, saint, narcissus, although, britten, had, little, idea, of, what, the, poem, was, about, the, musicologist, arnold, whittall, finds, the, text, almost, frighteningly, apt, for, a, composer, conscious, of, his, own, sickness, matthews, sees, narcissus, as, another, figure, from, magic, world, of, dreams, and, ideal, beauty, the, britten, scholar, donald, mitchell, has, written, it, is, easy, because, of, the, scope, stature, and, sheer, volume, of, the, operas, and, the, wealth, of, vocal, music, of, all, kinds, to, pay, insufficient, attention, to, the, many, works, britten, wrote, in, other, specifically, non, vocal, genres, maw, said, of, britten, he, is, one, of, the, 20th, century, s, great, orchestral, composers, his, orchestration, has, an, individuality, incisiveness, and, integration, with, the, musical, material, only, achieved, by, the, greatest, composers, among, britten, s, best, known, orchestral, works, are, the, variations, on, a, theme, of, frank, bridge, 1937, the, sinfonia, da, requiem, 1940, the, four, sea, interludes, 1945, and, the, young, person, s, guide, to, the, orchestra, 1945, the, variations, an, affectionate, tribute, to, britten, s, teacher, range, from, comic, parodies, of, italian, operatic, clich, s, and, viennese, waltzes, to, a, strutting, march, reflecting, the, rise, of, militarism, in, europe, and, a, mahlerian, funeral, march, the, piece, ends, with, an, exuberant, fugal, finale, the, sinfonia, moves, from, an, opening, lacrymosa, filled, with, fear, and, lamentation, to, a, fierce, dies, irae, and, then, to, a, final, requiem, aeternam, described, by, the, critic, herbert, glass, as, the, most, uneasy, eternal, rest, possible, mason, considers, the, sinfonia, a, failure, less, entertaining, than, usual, because, its, object, is, not, principally, to, entertain, but, to, express, symphonically, it, fails, because, it, is, neither, picturesquely, nor, formally, symphonic, the, sea, interludes, adapted, by, britten, from, the, full, score, of, peter, grimes, make, a, concert, suite, depicting, the, sea, and, the, borough, in, which, the, opera, is, set, the, character, of, the, music, is, strongly, contrasted, between, dawn, sunday, morning, moonlight, and, storm, the, commentator, howard, posner, observes, that, there, is, not, a, bar, in, the, interludes, no, matter, how, beautiful, that, is, free, of, foreboding, the, young, person, s, guide, based, on, a, theme, by, purcell, showcases, the, orchestra, s, individual, sections, and, groups, and, gained, widespread, popularity, from, the, outset, christopher, headington, calls, the, work, exuberant, and, uncomplicated, music, scored, with, clarity, and, vigour, fits, well, into, britten, s, oeuvre, david, matthews, calls, it, a, brilliant, educational, exercise, unlike, his, english, predecessors, such, as, elgar, and, vaughan, williams, and, composers, from, mainland, europe, whom, he, admired, including, mahler, and, shostakovich, britten, was, not, a, classical, symphonist, his, youthful, jeux, d, esprit, the, simple, symphony, 1934, is, in, conventional, symphonic, structure, observing, sonata, form, and, the, traditional, four, movement, pattern, but, of, his, mature, works, his, spring, symphony, 1949, is, more, a, song, cycle, than, a, true, symphony, and, the, concertante, cello, symphony, 1963, is, an, attempt, to, balance, the, traditional, concerto, and, symphony, during, its, four, movements, the, cello, symphony, moves, from, a, deeply, pessimistic, opening, to, a, finale, of, radiant, happiness, rare, for, britten, by, this, point, the, composer, considered, it, the, finest, thing, i, ve, written, the, piano, concerto, 1938, was, at, first, criticised, for, being, too, light, hearted, and, virtuoso, in, 1945, britten, revised, it, replacing, a, skittish, third, movement, with, a, more, sombre, passacaglia, that, in, matthews, s, view, gives, the, work, more, depth, and, makes, the, apparent, triumph, of, the, finale, more, ambivalent, the, violin, concerto, 1939, finished, in, the, first, weeks, of, the, world, war, has, virtuoso, elements, but, they, are, balanced, by, lyrical, and, elegiac, passages, undoubtedly, reflecting, britten, s, growing, concern, with, the, escalation, of, world, hostilities, neither, concerto, is, among, britten, s, most, popular, works, but, in, the, 21st, century, the, violin, concerto, which, is, technically, difficult, has, been, performed, more, frequently, than, before, both, in, the, concert, hall, and, on, record, and, has, enthusiastic, performers, and, advocates, notably, violinist, janine, jansen, britten, s, incidental, music, for, theatre, film, and, radio, much, of, it, unpublished, was, the, subject, of, an, essay, by, william, mann, published, in, 1952, in, the, first, detailed, critical, assessment, of, britten, s, music, to, that, date, of, these, pieces, the, music, for, a, radio, play, the, rescue, by, edward, sackville, west, is, praised, by, the, musicologist, lewis, foreman, as, of, such, stature, and, individual, character, as, to, be, worth, a, regular, place, alongside, other, dramatic, scores, mann, finds, in, this, score, pre, echoes, of, the, second, act, of, billy, budd, while, foreman, observes, that, britten, appears, to, have, made, passing, allusions, to, the, rescue, in, his, final, opera, death, in, venice, britten, s, close, friendship, with, rostropovich, inspired, the, cello, sonata, 1961, and, three, suites, for, solo, cello, 1964, 71, string, quartets, featured, throughout, britten, s, composing, career, from, a, student, work, in, 1928, to, his, third, string, quartet, 1975, the, second, quartet, from, 1945, was, written, in, homage, to, purcell, mason, considered, it, britten, s, most, important, instrumental, work, to, that, date, referring, to, this, work, keller, writes, of, the, ease, with, which, britten, relatively, early, in, his, compositional, career, solves, the, modern, sonata, problem, the, achievement, of, symmetry, and, unity, within, an, extended, ternary, circle, based, on, more, than, one, subject, keller, likens, the, innovatory, skill, of, the, quartet, to, that, of, walton, s, viola, concerto, the, third, quartet, was, britten, s, last, major, work, the, critic, colin, anderson, said, of, it, in, 2007, one, of, britten, s, greatest, achievements, one, with, interesting, allusions, to, bart, k, and, shostakovich, and, written, with, an, economy, that, opens, out, a, depth, of, emotion, that, can, be, quite, chilling, the, gemini, variations, 1965, for, flute, violin, and, piano, duet, were, based, on, a, theme, of, zolt, n, kod, ly, and, written, as, a, virtuoso, piece, for, the, 13, year, old, jeney, twins, musical, prodigies, whom, britten, had, met, in, budapest, in, the, previous, year, for, osian, ellis, britten, wrote, the, suite, for, harp, 1969, which, joan, chissell, in, the, times, described, as, a, little, masterpiece, of, concentrated, fancy, nocturnal, after, john, dowland, 1963, for, solo, guitar, was, written, for, julian, bream, and, has, been, praised, by, benjamin, dwyer, for, its, semantic, complexity, prolonged, musical, argument, and, philosophical, depth, britten, s, fellow, composers, had, divided, views, about, him, to, tippett, he, was, simply, the, most, musical, person, i, have, ever, met, with, an, incredible, technical, mastery, some, contemporaries, however, were, less, effusive, in, tippett, s, view, walton, and, others, were, convinced, that, britten, and, pears, were, leaders, of, a, homosexual, conspiracy, in, music, a, belief, tippett, dismisses, as, ridiculous, inspired, by, jealousy, of, britten, s, postwar, successes, leonard, bernstein, considered, britten, a, man, at, odds, with, the, world, and, said, of, his, music, f, you, hear, it, not, just, listen, to, it, superficially, you, become, aware, of, something, very, dark, the, tenor, robert, tear, who, was, closely, associated, with, britten, in, the, latter, part, of, the, composer, s, career, made, a, similar, point, there, was, a, great, huge, abyss, in, his, soul, he, got, into, the, valley, of, the, shadow, of, death, and, couldn, t, get, out, in, the, decade, after, britten, s, death, his, standing, as, a, composer, in, britain, was, to, some, extent, overshadowed, by, that, of, the, still, living, tippett, the, film, maker, tony, palmer, thought, that, tippett, s, temporary, ascendancy, might, have, been, a, question, of, the, two, composers, contrasting, personalities, tippett, had, more, warmth, and, had, made, fewer, enemies, in, any, event, this, was, a, short, lived, phenomenon, tippett, adherents, such, as, the, composer, robert, saxton, soon, rediscovered, their, enthusiasm, for, britten, whose, audience, steadily, increased, during, the, final, years, of, the, 20th, century, britten, has, had, few, imitators, brett, describes, him, as, inimitable, possessed, of, a, voice, and, sound, too, dangerous, to, imitate, nevertheless, after, his, death, britten, was, lauded, by, the, younger, generation, of, english, composers, to, whom, in, the, words, of, oliver, knussen, he, became, a, phenomenal, father, figure, brett, believes, that, he, affected, every, subsequent, british, composer, to, some, extent, he, is, a, key, figure, in, the, growth, of, british, musical, culture, in, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, and, his, effect, on, everything, from, opera, to, the, revitalization, of, music, education, is, hard, to, overestimate, whittall, believes, that, one, reason, for, britten, s, enduring, popularity, is, the, progressive, conservatism, of, his, music, he, generally, avoided, the, avant, garde, and, did, not, challenge, the, conventions, in, the, way, that, contemporaries, such, as, tippett, did, perhaps, says, brett, the, tide, that, swept, away, serialism, atonality, and, most, forms, of, musical, modernism, and, brought, in, neo, romanticism, minimalism, and, other, modes, of, expression, involved, with, tonality, carried, with, it, renewed, interest, in, composers, who, had, been, out, of, step, with, the, times, britten, defined, his, mission, as, a, composer, in, very, simple, terms, composers, should, aim, at, pleasing, people, today, as, seriously, as, we, can, britten, though, a, reluctant, conductor, and, a, nervous, pianist, was, greatly, sought, after, in, both, capacities, the, piano, accompanist, gerald, moore, wrote, in, his, memoirs, about, playing, at, all, the, main, music, festivals, except, for, aldeburgh, because, as, the, presiding, genius, there, is, the, greatest, accompanist, in, the, world, my, services, are, not, needed, britten, s, recital, partnership, with, pears, was, his, best, known, collaboration, but, he, also, accompanied, kathleen, ferrier, rostropovich, dietrich, fischer, dieskau, james, bowman, and, john, shirley, quirk, among, others, though, usually, too, nervous, to, play, piano, solos, britten, often, performed, piano, duets, with, clifford, curzon, or, richter, and, chamber, music, with, the, amadeus, quartet, the, composers, whose, works, other, than, his, own, he, most, often, played, were, mozart, and, schubert, the, latter, in, murray, perahia, s, view, was, britten, s, greatest, idol, as, a, boy, and, young, man, britten, had, intensely, admired, brahms, but, his, admiration, waned, to, nothing, and, brahms, seldom, featured, in, his, repertory, singers, and, players, admired, britten, s, conducting, and, david, webster, rated, it, highly, enough, to, offer, him, the, musical, directorship, of, the, covent, garden, opera, in, 1952, britten, declined, he, was, not, confident, of, his, ability, as, a, conductor, and, was, reluctant, to, spend, too, much, time, performing, rather, than, composing, as, a, conductor, britten, s, repertory, included, purcell, bach, haydn, mozart, and, schubert, and, occasional, less, characteristic, choices, including, schumann, s, scenes, from, goethe, s, faust, elgar, s, the, dream, of, gerontius, and, introduction, and, allegro, holst, s, egdon, heath, and, short, pieces, by, percy, grainger, britten, like, elgar, and, walton, before, him, was, signed, up, by, a, major, british, recording, company, and, performed, a, considerable, proportion, of, his, output, on, disc, for, the, decca, record, company, he, made, some, monaural, records, in, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, followed, with, the, enthusiastic, support, of, the, decca, producer, john, culshaw, by, numerous, stereophonic, versions, of, his, works, culshaw, wrote, the, happiest, hours, i, have, spent, in, any, studio, were, with, ben, for, the, basic, reason, that, it, did, not, seem, that, we, were, trying, to, make, records, or, video, tapes, we, were, just, trying, to, make, music, in, may, 1943, britten, made, his, debut, in, the, decca, studios, accompanying, sophie, wyss, in, five, of, his, arrangements, of, french, folk, songs, the, following, january, he, and, pears, recorded, together, in, britten, s, arrangements, of, british, folk, songs, and, the, following, day, in, duet, with, curzon, he, recorded, his,
