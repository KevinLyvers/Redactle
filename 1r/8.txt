as, he, knew, only, one, dance, step, the, complicated, peabody, but, he, knew, it, perfectly, this, was, enough, to, convince, the, producers, that, he, could, dance, and, he, copied, the, other, dancers, moves, and, added, them, to, his, repertoire, while, waiting, to, go, on, he, did, not, find, it, odd, to, play, a, woman, nor, was, he, embarrassed, he, later, recalled, how, he, was, able, to, shed, his, own, naturally, shy, persona, when, he, stepped, onto, the, stage, for, there, i, am, not, myself, i, am, not, that, fellow, jim, cagney, at, all, i, certainly, lost, all,

as, a, mountain, of, money, for, me, in, those, worrisome, days, in, deference, to, his, mother, s, concerns, he, got, a, job, as, a, brokerage, house, runner, this, did, not, stop, him, from, looking, for, more, stage, work, however, and, he, went, on, to, audition, successfully, for, a, chorus, part, in, the, william, b, friedlander, musical, pitter, patter, for, which, he, earned, 55, a, week, he, sent, 40, to, his, mother, each, week, so, strong, was, his, habit, of, holding, down, more, than, one, job, at, a, time, that, he, also, worked, as, a, dresser, for, one, of, the, leads, portered, the, casts, luggage, and, understudied, for, the, lead, among, the, chorus, line, performers, was, 20, year, old, frances, willard, billie, vernon, they, married, in, 1922, the, show, began,

berkeley, heights, new, jersey, pitter, patter, was, not, hugely, successful, but, it, did, well, enough, to, run, for, 32, weeks, making, it, possible, for, cagney, to, join, the, vaudeville, circuit, he, and, vernon, toured, separately, with, a, number, of, different, troupes, reuniting, as, vernon, and, nye, to, do, simple, comedy, routines, and, musical, numbers, nye, was, a, rearrangement, of, the, last, syllable, of, cagney, s, surname, one, of, the, troupes, cagney, joined, was, parker, rand, and, leach, taking, over, the, spot, vacated, when, archie, leach, who, later, changed, his, name, to, cary, grant, left, in, 1924, after, years, of, touring, and, struggling, to, make, money, cagney, and, vernon, moved, to, hawthorne, california, partly, for, cagney, to, meet,

the, studios, but, there, was, no, interest, eventually, they, borrowed, some, money, and, headed, back, to, new, york, via, chicago, and, milwaukee, enduring, failure, along, the, way, when, they,

with, drama, cagney, felt, that, he, only, got, the, role, because, his, hair, was, redder, than, that, of, alan, bunce, the, only, other, red, headed, performer, in, new, york, both, the, play, and, cagney, received, good, reviews, life, magazine, wrote, mr, cagney, in, a, less, spectacular, role, makes, a, few, minutes, silence, during, his, mock, trial, scene, something, that, many, a, more, established, actor, might, watch, with, profit, burns, mantle, wrote, that, it, contained, the, most, honest, acting, now, to, be, seen, in, new, york, following, the, four, month, run, of, outside, looking, in, the, cagneys, were, financially, secure, enough, for, cagney, to, return, to, vaudeville, over, the, next, few, years, achieving, various, success, during, this, period, he, met, george,

george, abbott, the, show, s, management, insisted, that, he, copy, broadway, lead, lee, tracy, s, performance, despite, cagney, s, discomfort, in, doing, so, but, the, day, before, the, show, sailed, for, england, they, decided, to, replace, him, this, was, a, devastating, turn, of, events, for, cagney, apart, from, the, logistical, difficulties, this, presented, the, couple, s, luggage, was, in, the, hold, of, the, ship, and, they, had, given, up, their, apartment, he, almost, quit, show, business, as, vernon, recalled, jimmy, said, that, it, was, all, over, he, made, up, his, mind, that, he, would, get, a, job, doing, something, else, the, cagneys, had, run, of, the, play, contracts, which, lasted, as, long, as, the, play, did, vernon, was, in, the, chorus, line, of, the, show, and, with, help, from, the, actors, equity, association, cagney, understudied, tracy, on, the, broadway, show, providing, them, with, a, desperately, needed, steady, income, cagney, also, established, a, dance, school, for, professionals, and, then, landed, a, part, in, the, play, women, go, on, forever, directed, by, john, cromwell, which, ran, for, four, months, by, the, end, of, the, run, cagney, was, exhausted, from, acting, and, running, the, dance, school, cagney, had, built, a, reputation, as, an, innovative, teacher, when, he, was, cast, as, the, lead, in, grand, street, follies, of, 1928, he, was, also, appointed, choreographer, the, show, received, rave, reviews, and, was, followed, by, grand, street, follies, of, 1929, these, roles, led, to, a, part, in, george, kelly, s, maggie, the, magnificent, a, play, the, critics, disliked, though, they, liked, cagney, s, performance, cagney, saw, this, role, and, women, go, on, forever, as, significant, because, of, the, talented, directors, he, met, he, learned, what, a, director, was, for, and, what, a, director, could, do, they, were, directors, who, could, play, all, the, parts, in, the, play, better, than, the, actors, cast, for, them, playing, opposite, cagney, in, maggie, the, magnificent, was, joan, blondell, who, starred, again, with, him, a, few, months, later, in, marie, baumer, s, new, play, penny, arcade, while, the, critics, panned, penny, arcade, they, praised, cagney, and, blondell, al, jolson, sensing, film, potential, bought, the, rights, for, 20, 000, he, then, sold, the, play, to, warner, bros, with, the, stipulation, that, they, cast, cagney, and, blondell, in, the, film, version, retitled, sinners, holiday, the, film, was, released, in, 1930, starring, grant, withers, and, evalyn, knapp, joan, blondell, recalled, that, when, they, were, casting, the, film, studio, head, jack, warner, believed, that, she, and, cagney, had, no, future, and, that, withers, and, knapp, were, destined, for, stardom, cagney, was, given, a, 500, a, week, three, week, contract, with, warner, bros, in, the, film, he, portrayed, harry, delano, a, tough, guy, who, becomes, a, killer, but, generates, sympathy, because, of, his, unfortunate, upbringing, this, role, of, the, sympathetic, bad, guy, was, to, become, a, recurring, character, type, for, cagney, throughout, his, career, during, filming, of, sinners, holiday, he, also, demonstrated, the, stubbornness, that, characterized, his, attitude, toward, the, work, he, later, recalled, an, argument, he, had, with, director, john, adolfi, about, a, line, there, was, a, line, in, the, show, where, i, was, supposed, to, be, crying, on, my, mother, s, breast, was, i, m, your, baby, ain, t, i, i, refused, to, say, it, adolfi, said, i, m, going, to, tell, zanuck, i, said, i, don, t, give, a, shit, what, you, tell, him, i, m, not, going, to, say, that, line, they, took, the, line, out, despite, this, outburst, the, studio, liked, him, and, before, his, three, week, contract, was, up, while, the, film, was, still, shooting, they, gave, cagney, a, three, week, extension, which, was, followed, by, a, full, seven, year, contract, at, 400, a, week, however, the, contract, allowed, warners, to, drop, him, at, the, end, of, any, 40, week, period, effectively, guaranteeing, him, only, 40, weeks, income, at, a, time, as, he, did, when, he, was, growing, up, cagney, shared, his, income, with, his, family, cagney, received, good, reviews, and, immediately, played, another, colorful, gangster, supporting, role, in, the, doorway, to, hell, 1930, starring, lew, ayres, the, film, was, a, financial, hit, and, helped, to, cement, cagney, s, growing, reputation, he, made, four, more, movies, before, his, breakthrough, role, warner, brothers, succession, of, gangster, movie, hits, in, particular, little, caesar, with, edward, g, robinson, culminated, in, the, 1931, film, the, public, enemy, due, to, the, strong, reviews, he, had, received, in, his, short, film, career, cagney, was, cast, as, nice, guy, matt, doyle, opposite, edward, woods, as, tom, powers, however, after, the, initial, rushes, the, actors, switched, roles, years, later, joan, blondell, recalled, that, a, few, days, into, the, filming, director, william, wellman, turned, to, cagney, and, said, now, you, re, the, lead, kid, jimmy, s, charisma, was, so, outstanding, she, added, the, film, cost, only, 151, 000, to, make, but, it, became, one, of, the, first, low, budget, films, to, gross, 1, million, cagney, received, widespread, praise, for, his, performance, the, new, york, herald, tribune, described, his, interpretation, as, the, most, ruthless, unsentimental, appraisal, of, the, meanness, of, a, petty, killer, the, cinema, has, yet, devised, he, received, top, billing, after, the, film, but, while, he, acknowledged, the, importance, of, the, role, to, his, career, he, always, disputed, the, suggestion, that, it, changed, the, way, heroes, and, leading, men, were, portrayed, he, cited, clark, gable, s, slapping, of, barbara, stanwyck, six, months, earlier, in, night, nurse, as, more, important, night, nurse, was, actually, released, three, months, after, the, public, enemy, gable, s, character, punched, stanwyck, s, knocking, the, nurse, unconscious, many, critics, view, the, scene, in, which, cagney, pushes, half, a, grapefruit, into, mae, clarke, s, face, as, one, of, the, most, famous, moments, in, movie, history, the, scene, itself, was, a, late, addition, and, the, origin, of, the, idea, is, a, matter, of, debate, producer, darryl, zanuck, claimed, he, thought, of, it, in, a, script, conference, wellman, said, the, idea, came, to, him, when, he, saw, the, grapefruit, on, the, table, during, the, shoot, and, writers, glasmon, and, bright, claimed, it, was, based, on, the, real, life, of, gangster, hymie, weiss, who, threw, an, omelette, into, his, girlfriend, s, face, joan, blondell, recalled, that, the, change, was, made, when, cagney, decided, the, omelette, wouldn, t, work, cagney, himself, usually, cited, the, writers, version, but, the, fruit, s, victim, clarke, agreed, that, it, was, wellman, s, idea, saying, i, m, sorry, i, ever, agreed, to, do, the, grapefruit, bit, i, never, dreamed, it, would, be, shown, in, the, movie, director, bill, wellman, thought, of, the, idea, suddenly, it, wasn, t, even, written, into, the, script, however, according, to, turner, classic, movies, tcm, the, grapefruit, scene, was, a, practical, joke, that, cagney, and, costar, mae, clarke, decided, to, play, on, the, crew, while, the, cameras, were, rolling, wellman, liked, it, so, much, that, he, left, it, in, tcm, also, notes, that, the, scene, made, clarke, s, ex, husband, lew, brice, very, happy, he, saw, the, film, repeatedly, just, to, see, that, scene, and, was, often, shushed, by, angry, patrons, when, his, delighted, laughter, got, too, loud, cagney, s, stubbornness, became, well, known, behind, the, scenes, especially, after, he, refused, to, join, in, a, 100, participation, free, charity, drive, pushed, by, douglas, fairbanks, jr, cagney, did, not, object, to, donating, money, to, charity, but, he, did, object, to, being, forced, to, give, already, he, had, acquired, the, nickname, the, professional, againster, warner, bros, was, quick, to, team, its, two, rising, gangster,

the, public, enemy, with, the, introduction, of, the, motion, picture, production, code, of, 1930, that, placed, limits, upon, on, screen, violence, warner, bros, allowed, cagney, a, change, of, pace, casting, him, in, the, comedy, blonde, crazy, again, opposite, blondell, the, public, enemy, was, an, enormous, box, office, success, and, cagney, began, to, compare, his, pay, with, that, of, his, peers, believing, that, his, contract, allowed, for, salary, adjustments, based, on, the, success, of, his, films, however, warner, bros, refused, to, allow, him, a, pay, raise, the, studio, heads, also, insisted, that, cagney, continue, promoting, their, films, even, those, in, which, he, did, not, appear, despite, his, opposition, cagney, returned, to, new, york, leaving, his, brother, bill,

money, for, his, successful, films, but, he, also, offered, to, take, a, smaller, salary, should, his, star, wane, warner, bros, refused, so, cagney, once, again, walked, out, he, held, out, for, 4000, a, week, the, same, salary, as, edward, g, robinson, douglas, fairbanks, jr, and, kay, francis, warner, bros, refused, to, cave, in, this, time, and, suspended, him, cagney, announced, that, he, would, do, his, next, three, pictures, for, free, if, they, canceled, the, five, years, remaining, on, his, contract, he, also, threatened, to, quit, hollywood, and, go, back, to, columbia, university, to, follow, his, brothers, into, medicine, after, six, months, of, suspension, frank, capra, brokered, a, deal, that, increased, cagney, s, salary, to, around, 3000, a, week, and, guaranteed, top, billing, and, no, more, than, four, films, a, year, having, learned, about, the, block, booking, studio, system, that, virtually, guaranteed, the, studios, huge, profits, cagney, was, determined, to, spread, the, wealth, he, regularly, sent, money, and, goods, to, old, friends, from, his, neighborhood, though, he, did, not, generally, make, this, known, his, insistence, on, no, more, than, four, films, a, year, was, based, on, his, having, witnessed, actors, even, teenagers, regularly, being, worked, 100, hours, a, week, to, turn, out, more, films, this, experience, was, an, integral, reason, for, his, involvement, in, forming, the, screen, actors, guild, in, 1933, cagney, returned, to, the, studio, and, made, hard, to, handle, 1933, this, was, followed, by, a, steady, stream, of, crowd, pleasing, films, including, the, highly, regarded, footlight, parade, which, gave, cagney, the, chance, to, return, to, his, song, and, dance, roots, the, film, includes, show, stopping, scenes, with, busby, berkeley, choreographed, routines, in, 1934, here, comes, the, navy, paired, him, with, pat, o, brien, for, the, first, of, nine, films, together, the, two, would, have, an, enduring, friendship, also, in, 1934, cagney, made, his, first, of, two, raucous, comedies, with, bette, davis, jimmy, the, gent, for, which, he, had, himself, heavily, made, up, with, thick, eyebrows, and, procured, an, odd, haircut, for, the, period, without, the, studio, s, permission, shaved, on, the, back, and, sides, cagney, initially, had, the, make, up, department, put, prominent, scars, on, the, back, of, his, head, for, a, close, up, but, the, studio, demanded, that, he, remove, them, cagney, s, and, davis, s, fast, paced, scenes, together, were, particularly, energetic, in, 1935, cagney, was, listed, as, one, of, the, top, ten, moneymakers, in, hollywood, for, the, first, time, and, was, cast, more, frequently, in, non, gangster, roles, he, played, a, lawyer, who, joins, the, fbi, in, g, men, and, he, also, took, on, his, first, and, only, shakespearean, role, as, top, billed, nick, bottom, in, a, midsummer, night, s, dream, alongside, joe, e, brown, as, francis, flute, and, mickey, rooney, as, puck, cagney, s, last, movie, in, 1935, was, ceiling, zero, his, third, film, with, pat, o, brien, o, brien, received, top, billing, which, was, a, clear, breach, of, cagney, s, contract, this, combined, with, the, fact, that, cagney, had, made, five, movies, in, 1934, again, against, his, contract, terms, caused, him, to, bring, legal, proceedings, against, warner, bros, for, breach, of, contract, the, dispute, dragged, on, for, several, months, cagney, received, calls, from, david, selznick, and, sam, goldwyn, but, neither, felt, in, a, position, to, offer, him, work, while, the, dispute, went, on, meanwhile, while, being, represented, by, his, brother, william, in, court, cagney, went, back, to, new, york, to, search, for, a, country, property, where, he, could, indulge, his, passion, for, farming, cagney, spent, most, of, the, next, year, on, his, farm, and, went, back, to, work, only, when, edward, l, alperson, from, grand, national, films, a, newly, established, independent, studio, approached, him, to, make, movies, for, 100, 000, a, film, and, 10, of, the, profits, cagney, made, two, films, for, grand, national, great, guy, and, something, to, sing, about, he, received, good, reviews, for, both, but, overall, the, production, quality, was, not, up, to, warner, bros, standards, and, the, films, did, not, do, well, a, third, film, dynamite, was, planned, but, grand, national, ran, out, of, money, cagney, also, became, involved, in, political, causes, and, in, 1936, agreed, to, sponsor, the, hollywood, anti, nazi, league, unknown, to, cagney, the, league, was, in, fact, a, front, organization, for, the, communist, international, comintern, which, sought, to, enlist, support, for, the, soviet, union, and, its, foreign, policies, the, courts, eventually, decided, the, warner, bros, lawsuit, in, cagney, s, favor, he, had, done, what, many, thought, unthinkable, taking, on, the, studios, and, winning, not, only, did, he, win, but, warner, bros, also, knew, that, he, was, still, their, foremost, box, office, draw, and, invited, him, back, for, a, five, year, 150, 000, a, film, deal, with, no, more, than, two, pictures, a, year, cagney, also, had, full, say, over, what, films, he, did, and, did, not, make, additionally, william, cagney, was, guaranteed, the, position, of, assistant, producer, for, the, movies, in, which, his, brother, starred, cagney, had, demonstrated, the, power, of, the, walkout, in, keeping, the, studios, to, their, word, he, later, explained, his, reasons, saying, i, walked, out, because, i, depended, on, the, studio, heads, to, keep, their, word, on, this, that, or, other, promise, and, when, the, promise, was, not, kept, my, only, recourse, was, to, deprive, them, of, my, services, cagney, himself, acknowledged, the, importance, of, the, walkout, for, other, actors, in, breaking, the, dominance, of, the, studio, system, normally, when, a, star, walked, out, the, time, he, or, she, was, absent, was, added, onto, the, end, of, an, already, long, contract, as, happened, with, olivia, de, havilland, and, bette, davis, cagney, however, walked, out, and, came, back, to, a, better, contract, many, in, hollywood, watched, the, case, closely, for, hints, of, how, future, contracts, might, be, handled, artistically, the, grand, national, experiment, was, a, success, for, cagney, who, was, able, to, move, away, from, his, traditional, warner, bros, tough, guy, roles, to, more, sympathetic, characters, how, far, he, could, have, experimented, and, developed, will, never, be, known, but, back, in, the, warner, fold, he, was, once, again, playing, tough, guys, cagney, s, two, films, of, 1938, boy, meets, girl, and, angels, with, dirty, faces, both, costarred, pat, o, brien, the, former, had, cagney, in, a, comedy, role, and, received, mixed, reviews, warner, bros, had, allowed, cagney, his, change, of, pace, but, was, keen, to, get, him, back, to, playing, tough, guys, which, was, more, lucrative, ironically, the, script, for, angels, was, one, that, cagney, had, hoped, to, do, while, with, grand, national, but, the, studio, had, been, unable, to, secure, funding, cagney, starred, as, rocky, sullivan, a, gangster, fresh, out, of, jail, and, looking, for, his, former, associate, played, by, humphrey, bogart, who, owes, him, money, while, revisiting, his, old, haunts, he, runs, into, his, old, friend, jerry, connolly, played, by, o, brien, who, is, now, a, priest, concerned, about, the, dead, end, kids, futures, particularly, as, they, idolize, rocky, after, a, messy, shootout, sullivan, is, eventually, captured, by, the, police, and, sentenced, to, death, in, the, electric, chair, connolly, pleads, with, rocky, to, turn, yellow, on, his, way, to, the, chair, so, the, kids, will, lose, their, admiration, for, him, and, hopefully, avoid, turning, to, crime, sullivan, refuses, but, on, his, way, to, his, execution, he, breaks, down, and, begs, for, his, life, it, is, unclear, whether, this, cowardice, is, real, or, just, feigned, for, the, kids, benefit, cagney, himself, refused, to, say, insisting, he, liked, the, ambiguity, the, film, is, regarded, by, many, as, one, of, cagney, s, finest, and, garnered, him, an, academy, award, for, best, actor, nomination, for, 1938, he, lost, to, spencer, tracy, in, boys, town, cagney, had, been, considered, for, the, role, but, lost, out, on, it, due, to, his, typecasting, he, also, lost, the, role, of, notre, dame, football, coach, knute, rockne, in, knute, rockne, all, american, to, his, friend, pat, o, brien, for, the, same, reason, cagney, did, however, win, that, year, s, new, york, film, critics, circle, award, for, best, actor, his, earlier, insistence, on, not, filming, with, live, ammunition, proved, to, be, a, good, decision, having, been, told, while, filming, angels, with, dirty, faces, that, he, would, be, doing, a, scene, with, real, machine, gun, bullets, a, common, practice, in, the, hollywood, of, the, time, cagney, refused, and, insisted, the, shots, be, added, afterwards, as, it, turned, out, a, ricocheting, bullet, passed, through, exactly, where, his, head, would, have, been, during, his, first, year, back, at, warner, bros, cagney, became, the, studio, s, highest, earner, making, 324, 000, he, starred, with, george, raft, in, the, smash, hit, each, dawn, i, die, an, extremely, entertaining, prison, movie, that, was, so, successful, at, the, box, office, that, it, prompted, the, studio, to, offer, raft, an, important, contract, in, the, wake, of, his, departure, from, paramount, in, addition, cagney, made, the, oklahoma, kid, a, memorable, western, with, humphrey, bogart, as, the, black, clad,

come, lately, at, this, time, cagney, heard, of, young, war, hero, audie, murphy, who, had, appeared, on, the, cover, of, life, magazine, cagney, thought, that, murphy, had, the, looks, to, be, a, movie, star, and, suggested, that, he, come, to, hollywood, cagney, felt, however, that, murphy, could, not, act, and, his, contract, was, loaned, out, and, then, sold, while, negotiating, the,

cagney, was, keen, to, begin, production, of, his, new, project, an, adaptation, of, william, saroyan, s, broadway, play, the, time, of, your, life, saroyan, himself, loved, the, film, but, it, was, a, commercial, disaster, costing, the, company, half, a, million, dollars, to, make, audiences, again, struggled, to, accept, cagney, in, a, nontough, guy, role, cagney, productions, was, in, serious, trouble, poor, returns, from, the, produced, films, and, a, legal, dispute, with, sam, goldwyn, studio, over, a, rental, agreement, forced, cagney, back, to, warner, bros, he, signed, a, distribution,

white, heat, is, one, of, his, most, memorable, cinema, had, changed, in, the, 10, years, since, walsh, last, directed, cagney, in, the, strawberry, blonde, and, the, actor, s, portrayal, of, gangsters, had, also, changed, unlike, tom, powers, in, the, public, enemy, jarrett, was, portrayed, as, a, raging, lunatic, with, few, if, any, sympathetic, qualities, in, the, 18, intervening, years, cagney, s, hair, had, begun, to, gray, and, he, developed, a, paunch, for, the, first, time, he, was, no, longer, a, dashing, romantic, commodity, in, precisely, the, same, way, he, obviously, was, before, and, this, was, reflected, in, his, performance, cagney, himself, had, the, idea, of, playing, jarrett, as, psychotic, he, later, stated, it, was, essentially, a, cheapie, one, two, three, four, kind, of, thing, so, i, suggested, we, make, him, nuts, it, was, agreed, so, we, put, in, all, those, fits, and, headaches, cagney, s, final, lines, in, the, film, made, it, ma, top, of, the, world, was, voted, the, 18th, greatest, movie, line, by, the, american, film, institute, likewise, jarrett, s, explosion, of, rage, in, prison, on, being, told, of, his, mother, s, death, is, widely, hailed, as, one, of, cagney, s, most, memorable, performances, some, of, the, extras, on, set, actually, became, terrified, of, the, actor, because, of, his, violent, portrayal, cagney, attributed, the, performance, to, his, father, s, alcoholic, rages, which, he, had, witnessed, as, a, child, as, well, as, someone, that, he, had, seen, on, a, visit, to, a, mental, hospital, homicidal, paranoiac, with, a, mother, fixation, warner, bros, publicity, description, of, cody, jarrett, in, white, heat, the, film, was, a, critical, success, though, some, critics, wondered, about, the, social, impact, of, a, character, that, they, saw, as, sympathetic, cagney, was, still, struggling, against, his, gangster, typecasting, he, said, to, a, journalist, it, s, what, the, people, want, me, to, do, some, day, though, i, d, like, to, make, another, movie, that, kids, could, go, and, see, however, warner, bros, perhaps, searching, for, another, yankee, doodle, dandy, assigned, cagney, a, musical, for, his, next, picture, 1950, s, the, west, point, story, with, doris, day, an, actress, he, admired, his, next, film, kiss, tomorrow, goodbye, was, another, gangster, movie, which, was, the, first, by, cagney, productions, since, its, acquisition, while, compared, unfavorably, to, white, heat, by, critics, it, was, fairly, successful, at, the, box, office, with, 500, 000, going, straight, to, cagney, productions, bankers, to, pay, off, their, losses, cagney, productions, was, not, a, great, success, however, and, in, 1953, after, william, cagney, produced, his, last, film, a, lion, is, in, the, streets, a, drama, loosely, based, on, flamboyant, politician, huey, long, the, company, came, to, an, end, cagney, s, next, notable, role, was, the, 1955, film, love, me, or, leave, me, his, third, with, doris, day, who, was, top, billed, above, cagney, for, this, picture, the, first, movie, for, which, he, d, accepted, second, billing, since, smart, money, in, 1931, cagney, played, martin, moe, the, gimp, snyder, a, lame, jewish, american, gangster, from, chicago, a, part, spencer, tracy, had, turned, down, cagney, described, the, script, as, that, extremely, rare, thing, the, perfect, script, when, the, film, was, released, snyder, reportedly, asked, how, cagney, had, so, accurately, copied, his, limp, but, cagney, himself, insisted, he, had, not, having, based, it, on, personal, observation, of, other, people, when, they, limped, what, i, did, was, very, simple, i, just, slapped, my, foot, down, as, i, turned, it, out, while, walking, that, s, all, his, performance, earned, him, another, best, actor, academy, award, nomination, 17, years, after, his, first, reviews, were, strong, and, the, film, is, considered, one, of, the, best, of, his, later, career, in, day, he, found, a, co, star, with, whom, he, could, build, a, rapport, such, as, he, had, had, with, blondell, at, the, start, of, his, career, day, herself, was, full, of, praise, for, cagney, stating, that, he, was, the, most, professional, actor, i, ve, ever, known, he, was, always, real, i, simply, forgot, we, were, making, a, picture, his, eyes, would, actually, fill, up, when, we, were, working, on, a, tender, scene, and, you, never, needed, drops, to, make, your, eyes, shine, when, jimmy, was, on, the, set, cagney, s, next, film, was, mister, roberts, directed, by, john, ford, and, slated, to, star, spencer, tracy, tracy, s, involvement, ensured, that, cagney, accepted, a, supporting, role, in, his, close, friend, s, movie, although, in, the, end, tracy, did, not, take, part, and, henry, fonda, played, the, titular, role, instead, cagney, enjoyed, working, with, the, film, s, superb, cast, despite, the, absence, of, tracy, major, film, star, william, powell, played, a, rare, supporting, role, as, doc, in, the, film, his, final, picture, before, retirement, from, a, stellar, career, that, had, spanned, 33, years, since, his, first, appearance, in, sherlock, holmes, with, john, barrymore, in, 1922, cagney, had, worked, with, ford, on, what, price, glory, three, years, earlier, and, they, had, gotten, along, fairly, well, however, as, soon, as, ford, had, met, cagney, at, the, airport, for, that, film, the, director, warned, him, that, they, would, eventually, tangle, asses, which, caught, cagney, by, surprise, he, later, said, i, would, have, kicked, his, brains, out, he, was, so, goddamned, mean, to, everybody, he, was, truly, a, nasty, old, man, the, next, day, cagney, was, slightly, late, on, set, incensing, ford, cagney, cut, short, his, imminent, tirade, saying, when, i, started, this, picture, you, said, that, we, would, tangle, asses, before, this, was, over, i, m, ready, now, are, you, ford, walked, away, and, they, had, no, more, problems, though, cagney, never, particularly, liked, ford, cagney, s, skill, at, noticing, tiny, details, in, other, actors, performances, became, apparent, during, the, shooting, of, mister, roberts, while, watching, the, kraft, music, hall, anthology, television, show, some, months, before, cagney, had, noticed, jack, lemmon, performing, left, handed, doing, practically, everything, with, his, left, hand, the, first, thing, that, cagney, asked, lemmon, when, they, met, was, if, he, was, still, using, his, left, hand, lemmon, was, shocked, he, had, done, it, on, a, whim, and, thought, no, one, else, had, noticed, he, said, of, his, co, star, his, powers, of, observation, must, be, absolutely, incredible, in, addition, to, the, fact, that, he, remembered, it, i, was, very, flattered, the, film, was, a, success, securing, three, oscar, nominations, including, best, picture, best, sound, recording, and, best, supporting, actor, for, lemmon, who, won, while, cagney, was, not, nominated, he, had, thoroughly, enjoyed, the, production, filming, on, midway, island, and, in, a, more, minor, role, meant, that, he, had, time, to, relax, and, engage, in, his, hobby, of, painting, he, also, drew, caricatures, of, the, cast, and, crew, in, 1955, cagney, replaced, spencer, tracy, on, the, western, film, tribute, to, a, bad, man, for, metro, goldwyn, mayer, he, received, praise, for, his, performance, and, the, studio, liked, his, work, enough, to, offer, him, these, wilder, years, with, barbara, stanwyck, the, two, stars, got, on, well, they, had, both, previously, worked, in, vaudeville, and, they, entertained, the, cast, and, crew, off, screen, by, singing, and, dancing, in, 1956, cagney, undertook, one, of, his, very, rare, television, roles, starring, in, robert, montgomery, s, soldiers, from, the, war, returning, this, was, a, favor, to, montgomery, who, needed, a, strong, fall, season, opener, to, stop, the, network, from, dropping, his, series, cagney, s, appearance, ensured, that, it, was, a, success, the, actor, made, it, clear, to, reporters, afterwards, that, television, was, not, his, medium, i, do, enough, work, in, movies, this, is, a, high, tension, business, i, have, tremendous, admiration, for, the, people, who, go, through, this, sort, of, thing, every, week, but, it, s, not, for, me, the, following, year, cagney, appeared, in, man, of, a, thousand, faces, in, which, he, played, a, fictionalized, version, of, lon, chaney, he, received, excellent, reviews, with, the, new, york, journal, american, rating, it, one, of, his, best, performances, and, the, film, made, for, universal, was, a, box, office, hit, cagney, s, skill, at, mimicry, combined, with, a, physical, similarity, to, chaney, helped, him, generate, empathy, for, his, character, later, in, 1957, cagney, ventured, behind, the, camera, for, the, first, and, only, time, to, direct, short, cut, to, hell, a, remake, of, the, 1941, alan, ladd, film, this, gun, for, hire, which, in, turn, was, based, on, the, graham, greene, novel, a, gun, for, sale, cagney, had, long, been, told, by, friends, that, he, would, make, an, excellent, director, so, when, he, was, approached, by, his, friend, producer, a, c, lyles, he, instinctively, said, yes, he, refused, all, offers, of, payment, saying, he, was, an, actor, not, a, director, the, film, was, low, budget, and, shot, quickly, as, cagney, recalled, we, shot, it, in, twenty, days, and, that, was, long, enough, for, me, i, find, directing, a, bore, i, have, no, desire, to, tell, other, people, their, business, in, 1959, cagney, played, a, labor, leader, in, what, proved, to, be, his, final, musical, never, steal, anything, small, which, featured, a, comical, song, and, dance, duet, with, cara, williams, who, played, his, girlfriend, for, cagney, s, next, film, he, traveled, to, ireland, for, shake, hands, with, the, devil, directed, by, michael, anderson, cagney, had, hoped, to, spend, some, time, tracing, his, irish, ancestry, but, time, constraints, and, poor, weather, meant, that, he, was, unable, to, do, so, the, overriding, message, of, violence, inevitably, leading, to, more, violence, attracted, cagney, to, the, role, of, an, irish, republican, army, commander, and, resulted, in, what, some, critics, would, regard, as, the, finest, performance, of, his, final, years, cagney, s, career, began, winding, down, and, he, made, only, one, film, in, 1960, the, critically, acclaimed, the, gallant, hours, in, which, he, played, admiral, william, f, bull, halsey, the, film, although, set, during, the, guadalcanal, campaign, in, the, pacific, theater, during, world, war, ii, was, not, a, war, film, but, instead, focused, on, the, impact, of, command, cagney, productions, which, shared, the, production, credit, with, robert, montgomery, s, company, made, a, brief, return, though, in, name, only, the, film, was, a, success, and, the, new, york, times, s, bosley, crowther, singled, its, star, out, for, praise, it, is, mr, cagney, s, performance, controlled, to, the, last, detail, that, gives, life, and, strong, heroic, stature, to, the, principal, figure, in, the, film, there, is, no, braggadocio, in, it, no, straining, for, bold, or, sharp, effects, it, is, one, of, the, quietest, most, reflective, subtlest, jobs, that, mr, cagney, has, ever, done, cagney, s, penultimate, film, was, a, comedy, he, was, hand, picked, by, billy, wilder, to, play, a, hard, driving, coca, cola, executive, in, the, film, one, two, three, cagney, had, concerns, with, the, script, remembering, back, 23, years, to, boy, meets, girl, in, which, scenes, were, reshot, to, try, to, make, them, funnier, by, speeding, up, the, pacing, with, the, opposite, effect, cagney, received, assurances, from, wilder, that, the, script, was, balanced, filming, did, not, go, well, though, with, one, scene, requiring, 50, takes, something, to, which, cagney, was, unaccustomed, in, fact, it, was, one, of, the, worst, experiences, of, his, long, career, cagney, noted, i, never, had, the, slightest, difficulty, with, a, fellow, actor, not, until, one, two, three, in, that, picture, horst, buchholz, tried, all, sorts, of, scene, stealing, didoes, i, came, close, to, knocking, him, on, his, ass, for, the, first, time, cagney, considered, walking, out, of, a, film, he, felt, he, had, worked, too, many, years, inside, studios, and, combined, with, a, visit, to, dachau, concentration, camp, during, filming, he, decided, that, he, had, had, enough, and, retired, afterward, one, of, the, few, positive, aspects, was, his, friendship, with, pamela, tiffin, to, whom, he, gave, acting, guidance, including, the, secret, that, he, had, learned, over, his, career, you, walk, in, plant, yourself, squarely, on, both, feet, look, the, other, fella, in, the, eye, and, tell, the, truth, cagney, remained, in, retirement, for, 20, years, conjuring, up, images, of, jack, l, warner, every, time, he, was, tempted, to, return, which, soon, dispelled, the, notion, after, he, had, turned, down, an, offer, to, play, alfred, doolittle, in, my, fair, lady, he, found, it, easier, to, rebuff, others, including, a, part, in, the, godfather, part, ii, he, made, few, public, appearances, preferring, to, spend, winters, in, los, angeles, and, summers, either, at, his, martha, s, vineyard, farm, or, at, verney, farms, in, new, york, when, in, new, york, billie, vernon, and, he, held, numerous, parties, at, the, silver, horn, restaurant, where, they, got, to, know, marge, zimmermann, the, proprietress, cagney, was, diagnosed, with, glaucoma, and, began, taking, eye, drops, but, continued, to, have, vision, problems, on, zimmermann, s, recommendation, he, visited, a, different, doctor, who, determined, that, glaucoma, had, been, a, misdiagnosis, and, that, cagney, was, actually, diabetic, zimmermann, then, took, it, upon, herself, to, look, after, cagney, preparing, his, meals, to, reduce, his, blood, triglycerides, which, had, reached, alarming, levels, such, was, her, success, that, by, the, time, cagney, made, a, rare, public, appearance, at, his, american, film, institute, life, achievement, award, ceremony, in, 1974, he, had, lost, 20, pounds, 9, 1, kg, and, his, vision, had, improved, charlton, heston, opened, the, ceremony, and, frank, sinatra, introduced, cagney, so, many, hollywood, stars, attended, said, to, be, more, than, for, any, event, in, history, that, one, columnist, wrote, at, the, time, that, a, bomb, in, the, dining, room, would, have, ended, the, movie, industry, in, his, acceptance, speech, cagney, lightly, chastised, the, impressionist, frank, gorshin, saying, oh, frankie, just, in, passing, i, never, said, mmmmmmmm, you, dirty, rat, what, i, actually, did, say, was, judy, judy, judy, a, joking, reference, to, a, similar, misquotation, attributed, to, cary, grant, i, think, he, s, some, kind, of, genius, his, instinct, it, s, just, unbelievable, i, could, just, stay, at, home, one, of, the, qualities, of, a, brilliant, actor, is, that, things, look, better, on, the, screen, than, the, set, jimmy, has, that, quality, director, milo, forman, while, at, coldwater, canyon, in, 1977, cagney, had, a, minor, stroke, after, he, spent, two, weeks, in, the, hospital, zimmermann, became, his, full, time, caregiver, traveling, with, billie, vernon, and, him, wherever, they, went, after, the, stroke, cagney, was, no, longer, able, to, undertake, many, of, his, favorite, pastimes, including, horseback, riding, and, dancing, and, as, he, became, more, depressed, he, even, gave, up, painting, encouraged, by, his, wife, and, zimmermann, cagney, accepted, an, offer, from, the, director, milo, forman, to, star, in, a, small, but, pivotal, role, in, the, film, ragtime, 1981, this, film, was, shot, mainly, at, shepperton, studios, in, surrey, england, and, on, his, arrival, at, southampton, aboard, the, queen, elizabeth, 2, cagney, was, mobbed, by, hundreds, of, fans, cunard, line, officials, who, were, responsible, for, security, at, the, dock, said, they, had, never, seen, anything, like, it, although, they, had, experienced, past, visits, by, marlon, brando, and, robert, redford, despite, the, fact, that, ragtime, was, his, first, film, in, 20, years, cagney, was, immediately, at, ease, flubbed, lines, and, miscues, were, committed, by, his, co, stars, often, simply, through, sheer, awe, howard, rollins, who, received, a, best, supporting, actor, oscar, nomination, for, his, performance, said, i, was, frightened, to, meet, mr, cagney, i, asked, him, how, to, die, in, front, of, the, camera, he, said, just, die, it, worked, who, would, know, more, about, dying, than, him, cagney, also, repeated, the, advice, he, had, given, to, pamela, tiffin, joan, leslie, and, lemmon, as, filming, progressed, cagney, s, sciatica, worsened, but, he, finished, the, nine, week, filming, and, reportedly, stayed, on, the, set, after, completing, his, scenes, to, help, the, other, actors, with, their, dialogue, cagney, s, frequent, co, star, pat, o, brien, appeared, with, him, on, the, british, chat, show, parkinson, in, the, early, 1980s, and, they, both, made, a, surprise, appearance, at, the, queen, mother, s, command, birthday, performance, at, the, london, palladium, in, 1980, his, appearance, onstage, prompted, the, queen, mother, to, rise, to, her, feet, the, only, time, she, did, so, during, the, whole, show, and, she, later, broke, protocol, to, go, backstage, to, speak, with, cagney, directly, cagney, made, a, rare, tv, appearance, in, the, lead, role, of, the, movie, terrible, joe, moran, in, 1984, this, was, his, last, role, cagney, s, health, was, fragile, and, more, strokes, had, confined, him, to, a, wheelchair, but, the, producers, worked, his, real, life, mobility, problem, into, the, story, they, also, decided, to, dub, his, impaired, speech, using, the, impersonator, rich, little, the, film, made, use, of, fight, clips, from, cagney, s, boxing, movie, winner, take, all, 1932, in, 1920, cagney, was, a, member, of, the, chorus, for, the, show, pitter, patter, where, he, met, frances, willard, billie, vernon, they, married, on, september, 28, 1922, and, the, marriage, lasted, until, his, death, in, 1986, frances, cagney, died, in,

willing, to, give, the, press, opportunities, for, photographs, he, generally, spent, his, personal, time, out, of, the, public, eye, cagney, s, son, died, from, a, heart, attack, on, january, 27, 1984, in, washington, d, c, two, years, before, his, father, s, death, james, iii, had, become, estranged, from, him, and, they, had, not, seen, or, talked, to, one, another, since, 1982, cagney, s, daughter, cathleen, was, also, estranged, from, her, father, during, the, final, years, of, his, life, she, died, on, august, 11, 2004, as, a, young, man, cagney, became, interested, in, farming, sparked, by, a, soil, conservation, lecture, he, had, attended, to, the, extent, that, during, his, first, walkout, from, warner, bros, he, helped, to, found, a, 100, acre, 0, 40, km, 2, farm, in, martha, s, vineyard, cagney, loved, that, no, paved, roads, surrounded, the, property, only, dirt, tracks, the, house, was, rather, run, down, and, ramshackle, and, billie, was, initially, reluctant, to, move, in, but, soon, came, to, love, the, place, as, well, after, being, inundated, by, movie, fans, cagney, sent, out, a, rumor, that, he, had, hired, a, gunman, for, security, the, ruse, proved, so, successful, that, when, spencer, tracy, came, to, visit, his, taxi, driver, refused, to, drive, up, to, the, house, saying, i, hear, they, shoot, tracy, had, to, go, the, rest, of, the, way, on, foot, in, 1955, having, shot, three, films, cagney, bought, a, 120, acre, 0, 49, km, 2, farm, in, stanfordville, dutchess, county, new, york, for, 100, 000, cagney, named, it, verney, farm, taking, the, first, syllable, from, billie, s, maiden, name, and, the, second, from, his, own, surname, he, turned, it, into, a, working, farm, selling, some, of, the, dairy, cattle, and, replacing, them, with, beef, cattle, he, expanded, it, over, the, years, to, 750, acres, 3, 0, km, 2, such, was, cagney, s, enthusiasm, for, agriculture, and, farming, that, his, diligence, and, efforts, were, rewarded, by, an, honorary, degree, from, florida, s, rollins, college, rather, than, just, turning, up, with, ava, gardner, on, my, arm, to, accept, his, honorary, degree, cagney, turned, the, tables, upon, the, college, s, faculty, by, writing, and, submitting, a, paper, on, soil, conservation, he, studied, judo, specifically, for, the, movie, blood, on, the, sun, in, 1945, and, then, continued, to, study, it, for, some, time, after, the, film, was, finished, his, use, of, actual, judo, throws, and, holds, in, the, movie, has, been, noted, as, the, first, appearance, of, eastern, martial, arts, in, western, film, cagney, was, born, in, 1899, prior, to, the, widespread, use, of, automobiles, and, loved, horses, from, childhood, as, a, child, he, often, sat, on, the, horses, of, local, deliverymen, and, rode, in, horse, drawn, streetcars, with, his, mother, as, an, adult, well, after, horses, were, replaced, by, automobiles, as, the, primary, mode, of, transportation, cagney, raised, horses, on, his, farms, specializing, in, morgans, a, breed, of, which, he, was, particularly, fond, cagney, was, a, keen, sailor, and, owned, boats, that, were, harbored, on, both, coasts, of, the, u, s, including, the, swift, of, ipswich, his, joy, in, sailing, however, did, not, protect, him, from, occasional, seasickness, becoming, ill, sometimes, on, a, calm, day, while, weathering, rougher, heavier, seas, at, other, times, cagney, greatly, enjoyed, painting, and, claimed, in, his, autobiography, that, he, might, have, been, happier, if, somewhat, poorer, as, a, painter, than, a, movie, star, the, renowned, painter, sergei, bongart, taught, cagney, in, his, later, life, and, owned, two, of, cagney, s, works, cagney, often, gave, away, his, work, but, refused, to, sell, his, paintings, considering, himself, an, amateur, he, signed, and, sold, only, one, painting, purchased, by, johnny, carson, to, benefit, a, charity, in, his, autobiography, cagney, said, that, as, a, young, man, he, had, no, political, views, since, he, was, more, concerned, with, from, where, his, next, meal, was, coming, however, the, emerging, labor, movement, of, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, soon, forced, him, to, take, sides, the, first, version, of, the, national, labor, relations, act, was, passed, in, 1935, and, growing, tensions, between, labor, and, management, fueled, the, movement, fanzines, in, the, 1930s, however, described, his, politics, as, radical, this, somewhat, exaggerated, view, was, enhanced, by, his, public, contractual, wranglings, with, warner, bros, at, the, time, his, joining, of, the, screen, actors, guild, in, 1933, and, his, involvement, in, the, revolt, against, the, so, called, merriam, tax, the, merriam, tax, was, an, underhanded, method, of, funnelling, studio, funds, to, politicians, during, the, 1934, californian, gubernatorial, campaign, the, studio, executives, would, tax, their, actors, automatically, taking, a, day, s, pay, from, their, biggest, earners, ultimately, sending, nearly, half, a, million, dollars, to, the, gubernatorial, campaign, of, frank, merriam, cagney, as, well, as, jean, harlow, publicly, refused, to, pay, and, cagney, even, threatened, that, if, the, studios, took, a, day, s, pay, for, merriam, s, campaign, he, would, give, a, week, s, pay, to, upton, sinclair, merriam, s, opponent, in, the, race, he, supported, political, activist, and, labor, leader, thomas, mooney, s, defense, fund, but, was, repelled, by, the, behavior, of, some, of, mooney, s, supporters, at, a, rally, around, the, same, time, he, gave, money, for, a, spanish, republican, army, ambulance, during, the, spanish, civil, war, which, he, put, down, to, being, a, soft, touch, this, donation, enhanced, his, liberal, reputation, he, also, became, involved, in, a, liberal, group, with, a, leftist, slant, along, with, ronald, reagan, however, when, he, and, reagan, saw, the, direction, in, which, the, group, was, heading, they, resigned, on, the, same, night, cagney, was, accused, of, being, a, communist, sympathizer, in, 1934, and, again, in, 1940, the, accusation, in, 1934, stemmed, from, a, letter, police, found, from, a, local, communist, official, that, alleged, that, cagney, would, bring, other, hollywood, stars, to, meetings, cagney, denied, this, and, lincoln, steffens, husband, of, the, letter, s, writer, backed, up, this, denial, asserting, that, the, accusation, stemmed, solely, from, cagney, s, donation, to, striking, cotton, workers, in, the, san, joaquin, valley, william, cagney, claimed, this, donation, was, the, root, of, the, charges, in, 1940, cagney, was, cleared, by, u, s, representative, martin, dies, jr, on, the, house, un, american, activities, committee, cagney, became, president, of, the,
