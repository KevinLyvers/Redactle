anaxandridas, ii, and, the, 17th, king, of, the, agiad, dynasty, a, spartan, royal, house, which, claimed, descent, from, the, mythical, demigod, heracles, leonidas, i, ascended, to, the, throne, in, c, 489, bc, succeeding, his, half, brother, king, cleomenes, i, he, ruled, jointly, along, with, king, leotychidas, until, his, death, in, 480, bc, when, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, pleistarchus, at, the, second, greco, persian, war, leonidas, led, the, allied, greek, forces, in, a, last, stand, at, the, battle, of, thermopylae, 480, bc, attempting, to, defend, the, pass, from, the, invading, persian, army, and, was, killed, early, during, the, third, and, last, day, of, the, battle, leonidas, entered, myth, as, a, hero, and, the, leader, of, the, 300, spartans, who, died, in, battle, at, thermopylae, while, the, greeks, lost, this, battle, they, were, able, to, expel, the, persian, invaders, in, the, following, year, according, to, herodotus, leonidas, mother, was, not, only, his, father, s, wife, but, also, his, father, s, niece, and, had, been, barren, for, so, long, that, the, ephors, the, five, annually, elected, administrators, of, the, spartan, constitution, tried, to, prevail, upon, king, anaxandridas, ii, to, set, her, aside, and, take, another, wife, anaxandridas, refused, claiming, his, wife, was, blameless, whereupon, the, ephors, agreed, to, allow, him, to, take, a, second, wife, without, setting, aside, his, first, this, second, wife, a, descendant, of, chilon, of, sparta, one, of, the, seven, sages, of, greece, promptly, bore, a, son, cleomenes, however, one, year, after, cleomenes, birth, anaxandridas, first, wife, also, gave, birth, to, a, son, dorieus, leonidas, was, the, second, son, of, anaxandridas, first, wife, and, either, the, elder, brother, or, twin, of, cleombrotus, leonidas, name, means, descendant, of, leon, and, he, was, named, after, his, grandfather, leon, of, sparta, the, doric, greek, suffix, with, corresponding, attic, form, mainly, means, descendant, of, but, literally, his, name, can, also, mean, son, of, a, lion, as, the, name, leon, means, lion, in, greek, king, anaxandridas, ii, died, in, c, 524, bc, and, cleomenes, succeeded, to, the, throne, sometime, between, then, and, 516, bc, dorieus, was, so, outraged, that, the, spartans, had, preferred, his, half, brother, over, himself, that, he, found, it, impossible, to, remain, in, sparta, he, made, one, unsuccessful, attempt, to, set, up, a, colony, in, africa, and, when, this, failed, sought, his, fortune, in, sicily, where, after, initial, successes, he, was, killed, leonidas, relationship, with, his, bitterly, antagonistic, elder, brothers, is, unknown, but, he, married, cleomenes, daughter, gorgo, sometime, before, coming, to, the, throne, in, 490, bc, leonidas, was, heir, to, the, agiad, throne, successor, of, cleomenes, i, and, a, full, citizen, homoios, at, the, time, of, the, battle, of, sepeia, against, argos, c, 494, bc, likewise, he, was, a, full, citizen, when, the, persians, sought, submission, from, sparta, and, met, with, vehement, rejection, in, 492, 491, bc, his, elder, half, brother, king, cleomenes, had, already, been, deposed, on, grounds, of, purported, insanity, and, had, fled, into, exile, when, athens, sought, assistance, against, the, first, persian, invasion, of, greece, that, ended, at, marathon, 490, bc, plutarch, wrote, when, someone, said, to, him, except, for, being, king, you, are, not, at, all, superior, to, us, leonidas, son, of, anaxandridas, and, brother, of, cleomenes, replied, but, were, i, not, better, than, you, i, should, not, be, king, the, product, of, the, agoge, leonidas, was, unlikely, to, have, been, referring, to, his, royal, blood, alone, but, rather, suggesting, that, like, his, brother, dorieus, he, had, proved, himself, superior, in, the, competitive, environment, of, spartan, training, and, society, thus, making, him, qualified, to, rule, leonidas, was, chosen, to, lead, the, combined, greek, forces, determined, to, resist, the, second, persian, invasion, of, greece, in, 481, bc, this, was, not, simply, a, tribute, to, sparta, s, military, prowess, the, probability, that, the, coalition, wanted, leonidas, personally, for, his, capability, as, a, military, leader, is, underlined, by, the, fact, that, just, two, years, after, his, death, the, coalition, preferred, athenian, leadership, to, the, leadership, of, either, leotychidas, or, leonidas, successor, as, regent, for, his, still, under, aged, son, pausanias, the, rejection, of, leotychidas, and, pausanias, was, not, a, reflection, on, spartan, arms, sparta, s, military, reputation, had, never, stood, in, higher, regard, nor, was, sparta, less, powerful, in, 478, bc, than, it, had, been, in, 481, bc, this, selection, of, leonidas, to, lead, the, defence, of, greece, against, xerxes, invasion, led, to, leonidas, death, in, the, battle, of, thermopylae, in, 480, bc, upon, receiving, a, request, from, the, confederated, greek, forces, to, aid, in, defending, greece, against, the, persian, invasion, sparta, consulted, the, oracle, at, delphi, the, oracle, is, said, to, have, made, the, following, prophecy, in, hexameter, verse, for, you, inhabitants, of, wide, wayed, sparta, either, your, great, and, glorious, city, must, be, wasted, by, persian, men, or, if, not, that, then, the, bound, of, lacedaemon, must, mourn, a, dead, king, from, heracles, line, the, might, of, bulls, or, lions, will, not, restrain, him, with, opposing, strength, for, he, has, the, might, of, zeus, i, declare, that, he, will, not, be, restrained, until, he, utterly, tears, apart, one, of, these, in, august, 480, bc, leonidas, marched, out, of, sparta, to, meet, xerxes, army, at, thermopylae, with, a, small, force, of, 1, 200, men, 900, helots, and, 300, spartan, hoplites, where, he, was, joined, by, forces, from, other, greek, city, states, who, put, themselves, under, his, command, to, form, an, army, of, 7, 000, strong, there, are, various, theories, on, why, leonidas, was, accompanied, by, such, a, small, force, of, hoplites, according, to, herodotus, the, spartans, sent, the, men, with, leonidas, on, ahead, so, that, the, rest, of, the, allies, would, see, them, and, march, with, no, fear, of, defeat, instead, of, siding, with, the, persians, like, the, others, if, they, learned, that, the, spartans, were, delaying, after, completing, their, festival, the, carneia, they, left, their, garrison, at, sparta, and, marched, in, full, force, towards, thermopylae, the, rest, of, the, allies, planned, to, do, likewise, for, the, olympiad, coincided, with, these, events, they, accordingly, sent, their, advance, guard, not, expecting, the, war, at, thermopylae, to, be, decided, so, quickly, many, modern, commentators, are, dissatisfied, with, this, explanation, and, point, to, the, fact, that, the, olympic, games, were, in, progress, or, impute, internal, dissent, and, intrigue, whatever, the, reason, sparta, s, own, contribution, was, just, 300, spartiates, accompanied, by, their, attendants, and, probably, perioikoi, auxiliaries, the, total, force, assembled, for, the, defence, of, the, pass, of, thermopylae, came, to, something, between, four, and, seven, thousand, greeks, they, faced, a, persian, army, who, had, invaded, from, the, north, of, greece, under, xerxes, i, herodotus, stated, that, this, army, consisted, of, over, two, million, men, modern, scholars, consider, this, to, be, an, exaggeration, and, give, estimates, ranging, from, 70, 000, to, 300, 000, xerxes, waited, four, days, to, attack, hoping, the, greeks, would, disperse, finally, on, the, fifth, day, the, persians, attacked, leonidas, and, the, greeks, repulsed, the, persians, frontal, attacks, during, the, fifth, and, sixth, days, killing, roughly, 10, 000, of, the, enemy, troops, the, persian, elite, unit, known, to, the, greeks, as, the, immortals, was, held, back, and, two, of, xerxes, brothers, abrocomes, and, hyperanthes, died, in, battle, on, the, seventh, day, august, 11, a, malian, greek, traitor, named, ephialtes, led, the, persian, general, hydarnes, by, a, mountain, track, to, the, rear, of, the, greeks, at, that, point, leonidas, sent, away, most, of, the, greek, troops, and, remained, in, the, pass, with, his, 300, spartans, 900, helots, 400, thebans, and, 700, thespians, the, thespians, stayed, entirely, of, their, own, will, declaring, that, they, would, not, abandon, leonidas, and, his, followers, their, leader, was, demophilus, son, of, diadromes, and, as, herodotus, writes, hence, they, lived, with, the, spartans, and, died, with, them, one, theory, provided, by, herodotus, is, that, leonidas, sent, away, the, remainder, of, his, men, because, he, cared, about, their, safety, the, king, would, have, thought, it, wise, to, preserve, those, greek, troops, for, future, battles, against, the, persians, but, he, knew, that, the, spartans, could, never, abandon, their, post, on, the, battlefield, the, soldiers, who, stayed, behind, were, to, protect, their, escape, against, the, persian, cavalry, herodotus, believed, that, leonidas, gave, the, order, because, he, perceived, the, allies, to, be, disheartened, and, unwilling, to, encounter, the, danger, to, which, his, own, mind, was, made, up, he, therefore, chose, to, dismiss, all, the, troops, except, the, thebans, thespians, and, helots, and, save, the, glory, for, the, spartans, of, the, small, greek, force, which, was, attacked, from, both, sides, all, were, killed, except, for, the, 400, thebans, who, surrendered, to, xerxes, without, a, fight, when, leonidas, was, killed, the, spartans, retrieved, his, body, after, driving, back, the, persians, four, times, herodotus, says, that, xerxes, orders, were, to, have, leonidas, head, cut, off, and, put, on, a, stake, and, his, body, crucified, this, was, considered, sacrilegious, a, hero, cult, of, leonidas, survived, in, sparta, until, the, antonine, era, 2nd, century, ad, leonideia, were, solemnities, celebrated, every, year, in, sparta, in, honour, of, leonidas, and, only, spartans, were, allowed, to, take, part, the, contest, was, held, opposite, the, theatre, at, sparta, where, there, were, the, two, sepulchral, monuments, of, pausanias, and, leonidas, a, bronze, statue, of, leonidas, was, erected, at, thermopylae, in, 1955, a, sign, under, the, statue, reads, simply, come, and, take, them, which, was, leonidas, laconic, reply, when, xerxes, offered, to, spare, the, lives, of, the, spartans, if, they, gave, up, their, arms, another, statue, also, with, the, inscription, was, erected, in, sparta, in, 1968, leonidas, was, the, name, of, an, epic, poem, written, by, richard, glover, which, originally, appeared, in, 1737, it, went, on, to, appear, in, four, other, editions, being, expanded, from, 9, books, to, 12, he, is, a, central, figure, in, steven, pressfield, s, novel, gates, of, fire, and, appears, as, the, protagonist, of, frank, miller, s, 1998, comic, book, series, 300, it, presents, a,
