flagstad, had, just, met, her, soon, to, be, second, husband, and, had, even, briefly, considered, giving, up, opera, altogether, then, in, the, summer, of, 1934, when, the, met, needed, a, replacement, for, frida, leider, flagstad, agreed, to, audition, for, conductor, artur, bodanzky, and, met, general, manager, giulio, gatti, casazza, in, st, moritz, in, august, 1934, and, she, was, engaged, immediately, upon, leaving, st, moritz, bodanzky, s, parting, words, for, flagstad, were, come, to, new, york, as, soon, as, you, know, these, roles, isolde, the, three, br, nnhildes, leonore, in, fidelio, and, the, marschallin, in, der, rosenkavalier, and, above, all, do, not, go, and, get, fat, your, slender, youthful, figure, is, not, the, least, reason, you, were, engaged, at, the, met, flagstad, became, a, pupil, of, vocal, coach, hermann, weigert, who, prepared, her, for, all, her, roles, with, the, company, her, debut, at, the, met, as, sieglinde, in, die, walk, re, on, the, afternoon, of, 2, february, 1935, created, a, sensation, though, it, was, not, planned, as, a, special, event, by, this, time, after, weeks, of, rehearsals, met, management, already, knew, what, they, had, but, they, nonetheless, decided, on, a, low, key, debut, flagstad, was, unknown, in, the, united, states, at, the, time, the, performance, was, however, broadcast, nationwide, on, the, met, s, weekly, syndicated, radio, program, and, the, first, inkling, of, the, deluge, of, critical, praise, to, come, was, given, when, intermission, host, and, former, met, star, geraldine, farrar, discarded, her, prepared, notes, overwhelmed, by, what, she, had, just, heard, and, breathlessly, announced, that, a, new, star, had, just, been, born, days, later, flagstad, sang, isolde, and, later, that, month, she, performed, br, nnhilde, in, die, walk, re, and, g, tterd, mmerung, for, the, first, time, before, the, end, of, the, season, flagstad, sang, elsa, in, lohengrin, elisabeth, in, tannh, user, and, her, first, kundry, in, parsifal, almost, overnight, she, had, established, herself, as, the, pre, eminent, wagnerian, soprano, of, the, era, according, to, most, critics, she, still, remains, the, supreme, wagnerian, dramatic, soprano, on, disc, by, virtue, of, her, unique, voice, it, has, been, said, that, she, saved, the, metropolitan, opera, from, looming, bankruptcy, her, performances, sometimes, three, or, four, a, week, in, her, early, days, at, the, met, quickly, sold, out, at, the, box, office, as, soon, as, they, went, on, sale, her, services, to, the, met, were, not, from, box, office, receipts, alone, her, nationwide, personal, appeals, to, radio, listeners, during, saturday, matinee, intermissions, brought, thousands, of, dollars, in, donations, to, the, met, s, coffers, fidelio, 1936, and, later, was, her, only, non, wagnerian, role, at, the, met, before, the, war, in, 1935, she, performed, all, three, br, nnhildes, in, the, san, francisco, opera, s, ring, cycle, in, 1937, she, first, appeared, at, the, chicago, city, opera, company, in, 1936, and, 1937, flagstad, performed, the, roles, of, isolde, br, nnhilde, and, senta, at, the, royal, opera, house, covent, garden, under, sir, thomas, beecham, fritz, reiner, and, wilhelm, furtw, ngler, arousing, as, much, enthusiasm, there, as, she, had, in, new, york, she, also, toured, australia, in, 1938, hollywood, also, tried, to, cash, in, on, flagstad, fever, after, her, sudden, popularity, in, the, us, in, the, mid, 1930s, with, her, many, appearances, on, nbc, radio, the, kraft, music, hall, with, bing, crosby, and, regular, appearances, on, cbs, s, the, ford, sunday, evening, hour, though, flagstad, was, not, interested, in, stardom, or, hollywood, contracts, per, se, she, did, make, trips, to, hollywood, during, the, late, 1930s, for, publicity, photo, shoots, public, appearances, concerts, at, the, hollywood, bowl, and, she, filmed, a, rendition, of, br, nnhilde, s, battle, cry, from, die, walk, re, for, the, hollywood, variety, show, anthology, the, big, broadcast, of, 1938, in, which, she, was, introduced, to, american, film, audiences, by, bob, hope, flagstad, and, sonja, henie, are, the, only, two, norwegians, to, have, their, own, stars, on, hollywood, s, walk, of, fame, her, career, at, the, met, however, was, not, without, its, ups, and, downs, flagstad, got, involved, in, a, long, running, feud, with, tenor, co, star, lauritz, melchior, after, melchior, took, offense, to, some, comments, flagstad, made, about, stupid, publicity, photos, during, a, game, of, bridge, in, flagstad, s, hotel, suite, while, the, two, were, on, tour, together, in, rochester, ny, present, during, the, infamous, bridge, game, were, flagstad, melchior, and, his, wife, and, edwin, mcarthur, afterwards, melchior, fanned, the, flames, further, by, insisting, that, there, be, no, solo, curtain, calls, for, flagstad, when, the, two, performed, together, audiences, had, no, clue, that, despite, the, marvelous, and, sometimes, historic, performances, the, two, never, said, a, word, to, each, other, off, stage, for, the, next, two, years, it, was, flagstad, s, husband, henry, johansen, who, finally, brought, the, two, together, to, make, peace, flagstad, also, feuded, with, the, met, s, general, manager, edward, johnson, after, conductor, artur, bodanzky, s, death, when, she, asked, to, be, conducted, for, a, few, performances, by, her, accompanist, edwin, mcarthur, rather, than, by, the, met, s, new, conductor, erich, leinsdorf, flagstad, had, wanted, this, for, mcarthur, whom, she, had, taken, under, her, wing, johnson, refused, and, would, not, hear, of, it, any, further, flagstad, did, get, her, way, though, she, went, over, johnson, s, head, and, discussed, the, matter, with, the, met, s, board, of, directors, particularly, david, sarnoff, rca, and, nbc, founder, and, chairman, it, was, sarnoff, who, made, the, arrangements, for, mcarthur, to, begin, conducting, met, productions, on, a, limited, basis, her, relationship, with, johnson, improved, however, just, before, flagstad, left, the, met, in, 1941, on, the, night, of, her, 100th, performance, of, isolde, she, received, 100, roses, courtesy, of, melchior, and, johnson, having, received, repeated, and, cryptic, cablegrams, from, her, husband, who, had, returned, to, norway, a, year, and, a, half, earlier, flagstad, was, forced, to, consider, leaving, the, united, states, in, 1941, though, dismissing, the, political, implications, of, the, departure, of, someone, of, her, fame, from, the, united, states, to, german, occupied, norway, it, was, nonetheless, a, difficult, decision, for, her, she, had, many, friends, colleagues, and, of, course, many, fans, all, over, the, us, even, more, importantly, her, 20, year, old, daughter, else, had, married, an, american, named, arthur, dusenberry, and, was, living, with, her, new, husband, on, a, dude, ranch, in, bozeman, montana, it, was, edwin, mcarthur, who, gave, the, bride, away, at, the, wedding, in, bozeman, a, year, earlier, nonetheless, against, the, best, advice, of, her, friends, and, colleagues, including, former, president, herbert, hoover, who, pleaded, with, her, to, stay, out, of, europe, she, returned, to, norway, via, lisbon, madrid, barcelona, marseille, and, berlin, in, april, 1941, though, during, the, war, she, performed, only, in, sweden, and, switzerland, countries, not, occupied, by, german, forces, this, fact, did, not, temper, the, storm, of, public, opinion, that, hurt, her, personally, and, professionally, for, the, next, several, years, her, husband, was, arrested, after, the, war, for, profiteering, during, the, occupation, that, involved, his, lumber, business, this, arrest, together, with, her, decision, to, remain, in, occupied, norway, made, her, unpopular, particularly, in, the, united, states, both, the, norwegian, ambassador, and, columnist, walter, winchell, spoke, out, against, her, in, 1948, she, performed, several, benefit, concerts, for, the, united, jewish, appeal, in, defense, of, flagstad, s, husband, henry, johansen, after, his, death, it, was, revealed, that, during, the, occupation, he, was, arrested, by, the, gestapo, and, held, for, eight, days, also, one, of, johansen, s, sons, by, his, first, marriage, henry, jr, had, been, a, member, of, the, norwegian, underground, throughout, the, war, flagstad, eventually, returned, to, the, metropolitan, opera, invited, by, its, new, general, manager, rudolf, bing, who, was, furiously, criticized, for, this, choice, the, greatest, soprano, of, this, century, must, sing, in, the, world, s, greatest, opera, house, he, replied, she, also, returned, to, covent, garden, following, its, reopening, in, 1947, a, rare, exception, the, opera, house, in, acute, financial, straits, following, the, war, time, closure, was, attempting, to, build, up, a, house, company, of, english, nationals, principally, singing, in, english, in, preference, to, expensive, guest, stars, in, four, consecutive, seasons, from, 1948, to, 1952, she, sang, in, all, her, regular, wagnerian, roles, including, kundry, and, sieglinde, she, toured, south, america, in, 1948, and, returned, to, san, francisco, in, 1949, and, finally, returned, to, the, met, in, the, 1950, 1951, season, although, she, was, aged, well, into, her, 50s, flagstad, showed, herself, still, in, remarkable, form, as, isolde, br, nnhilde, and, leonore, despite, the, great, fanfare, surrounding, her, return, to, the, met, in, early, 1951, and, her, success, in, resuming, her, roles, there, flagstad, decided, that, it, would, be, her, final, year, singing, wagner, on, the, stage, she, had, gained, quite, a, bit, of, weight, since, her, pre, war, years, at, the, met, when, she, sang, those, long, and, physically, demanding, roles, night, after, night, in, 1950, when, she, accepted, bing, s, invitation, she, felt, she, did, not, have, the, stamina, she, had, had, as, a, younger, woman, she, had, also, developed, an, arthritic, hip, in, mid, 1951, and, had, to, consult, doctors, in, new, york, this, further, made, the, operatic, stage, difficult, for, her, especially, when, singing, wagner, she, gave, her, farewell, operatic, performance, at, the, met, on, 1, april, 1952, not, as, br, nnhilde, or, isolde, but, in, the, title, role, of, gluck, s, alceste, a, role, she, had, learnt, in, the, war, years, in, norway, in, london, she, appeared, as, dido, another, recently, learnt, role, in, purcell, s, dido, and, aeneas, at, the, mermaid, theatre, to, celebrate, the, coronation, of, queen, elizabeth, 11, in, july, 1953, madam, flagstad, appeared, as, dido, in, bernard, miles, reconstructed, globe, theatre, which, was, erected, inside, the, royal, exchange, building, in, the, city, of, london, i, desmond, flanagan, and, another, lamda, student, bill, horsley, acted, as, stage, hands, for, the, production, and, actually, pushed, queen, dido, s, throne, on, to, and, off, the, stage, area, with, the, use, of, ropes, and, a, pole, the, portrayal, was, recorded, in, studio, and, issued, by, emi, in, january, 1953, see, recordings, her, last, operatic, appearance, was, as, dido, in, oslo, on, june, 5, 1953, she, was, a, guest, on, the, bbc, radio, show, desert, island, discs, on, 29, april, 1952, during, the, post, war, years, flagstad, was, also, responsible, for, the, world, premiere, of, richard, strauss, s, four, last, songs, strauss, had, written, the, pieces, during, his, exile, in, switzerland, following, the, war, like, flagstad, he, had, been, vilified, as, a, collaborator, with, the, nazis, he, intended, them, to, be, premiered, by, flagstad, though, not, because, he, had, her, voice, in, mind, the, songs, are, better, suited, to, the, lyric, soprano, voice, he, idealised, throughout, his, life, as, exemplified, by, elisabeth, schumann, and, ultimately, his, wife, pauline, de, ahna, strauss, moreover, had, heard, praise, for, flagstad, over, the, years, but, had, not, heard, her, sing, in, person, since, casting, her, as, the, soprano, soloist, in, the, 1933, bayreuth, festival, performance, of, the, beethoven, choral, symphony, it, was, rather, out, of, sympathy, for, her, difficulties, he, sent, flagstad, a, letter, accompanied, by, a, collection, of, his, own, works, which, he, desired, her, to, consider, adding, to, her, repertoire, and, requested, that, she, give, the, premiere, together, with, a, first, class, conductor, and, ensemble, of, these, four, new, orchestral, lieder, at, that, point, still, in, the, publication, process, flagstad, accepted, the, commission, although, strauss, did, not, live, to, see, the, premiere, as, a, conductor, she, chose, not, mcarthur, who, though, an, excellent, piano, accompanist, was, not, considered, a, first, class, orchestral, conductor, but, wilhelm, furtw, ngler, also, experiencing, the, repercussions, of, suspect, wartime, conduct, and, the, pair, chose, walter, legge, s, philharmonia, orchestra, with, which, they, both, worked, well, to, provide, the, accompaniment, by, the, time, of, the, premiere, on, 22, may, 1950, at, london, s, royal, albert, hall, flagstad, was, almost, 55, years, old, her, voice, by, this, point, was, darker, heavier, and, more, inflexible, than, when, she, had, sung, for, strauss, at, bayreuth, and, she, was, becoming, reluctant, to, venture, above, the, staff, as, would, be, notoriously, demonstrated, in, the, recording, of, tristan, und, isolde, two, years, later, the, strauss, songs, particularly, the, hesse, settings, were, thus, not, ideally, suited, to, her, resources, and, she, found, herself, tested, to, her, limits, fr, hling, indeed, gave, such, trouble, that, legge, in, promoting, the, concert, was, two, days, before, the, event, advertising, the, strauss, as, three, songs, with, orchestra, in, the, event, flagstad, rose, to, the, occasion, and, included, fr, hling, excluding, however, the, highest, note, and, the, close, of, im, abendrot, was, followed, by, a, respectful, silence, in, memory, of, strauss, the, concert, which, aside, from, the, strauss, songs, consisted, of, wagner, including, isolde, s, liebestod, and, br, nnhilde, s, immolation, received, favorable, reviews, recordings, of, flagstad, s, contributions, were, made, from, the, radio, broadcast, and, are, today, commercially, available, flagstad, added, september, beim, schlafengehen, and, im, abendrot, to, her, repertoire, and, recordings, technologically, superior, to, those, taken, at, the, premiere, exist, of, these, performed, in, concert, she, did, not, however, sing, fr, hling, again, after, her, retirement, from, the, stage, she, continued, to, give, concert, performances, and, record, first, for, emi, setting, down, her, definitive, account, of, isolde, in, the, first, commercially, released, account, of, tristan, und, isolde, and, then, for, decca, records, she, even, made, some, stereophonic, recordings, including, excerpts, from, wagner, s, operas, with, hans, knappertsbusch, and, sir, georg, solti, conducting, the, vienna, philharmonic, orchestra, in, 1958, she, sang, the, part, of, fricka, in, wagner, s, das, rheingold, the, first, instalment, in, solti, s, complete, stereophonic, set, of, the, ring, cycle, released, by, decca, on, lp, and, reel, to, reel, tape, she, also, spent, time, mentoring, young, singers, in, her, native, country, including, contralto, eva, gustavson, from, around, 1952, when, she, gave, her, met, farewell, until, her, death, 10, years, later, flagstad, s, health, steadily, deteriorated, she, was, in, and, out, of, hospitals, on, an, increasing, basis, both, in, the, number, and, the, length, of, her, stays, for, a, variety, of, ailments, she, even, joked, with, an, interviewer, in, 1958, that, oslo, hospital, had, become, her, home, away, from, home, from, 1958, to, 1960, flagstad, was, the, first, director, of, the, norwegian, national, opera, in, her, last, years, she, gave, many, benefit, concerts, throughout, norway, she, was, diagnosed, with, bone, marrow, cancer, in, 1960, and, died, of, the, disease, on, 7, december, 1962, at, her, request, she, was, buried, in, an, unmarked, grave, in, vestre, gravlund, cemetery, in, the, frogner, borough, of, oslo, the, largest, floral, arrangement, at, her, funeral, was, sent, by, lauritz, melchior, flagstad, sang, many, roles, especially, in, the, early, part, of, her, career, before, she, became, famous, as, a, wagnerian, dramatic, soprano, this, is, a, list, of, her, principal, ones, with, role, debut, dates, the, kirsten, flagstad, museum, in, hamar, norway, contains, a, private, collection, of, opera, artifacts, her, costumes, draw, special, attention, and, include, several, examples, on, loan, from, the, metropolitan, opera, archives, her, portrait, appeared, on, the, norwegian, 100, kroner, bill, and, on, the, tail, section, of, norwegian, air, shuttle, planes, that, voice, how, can, one, describe, it, wrote, opera, critic, harold, c, schonberg, in, his, new, york, times, obituary, of, flagstad, it, was, enormous, but, did, not, sound, enormous, because, it, was, never, pushed, or, out, of, placement, it, had, a, rather, cool, silvery, quality, and, was, handled, instrumentally, almost, as, though, a, huge, violin, was, emitting, legato, phrases, incredibly, flagstad, sang, the, role, of, isolde, 70, times, on, the, met, stage, from, 1935, to, 1941, making, tristan, und, isolde, one, of, the, greatest, box, office, attractions, in, metropolitan, opera, history, nine, of, those, performances, were, saturday, matinee, radio, broadcasts, of, her, many, recordings, the, complete, tristan, und, isolde, with, furtw, ngler, is, considered, the, finest, representation, of, her, interpretive, art, in, its, maturity, it, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, recordings, of, all, time, throughout, her, career, she, recorded, numerous, songs, by, grieg, and, others, and, these, are, evidence, of, a, voice, that, maintained, its, stable, beauty, during, her, many, years, in, the, limelight, a, comprehensive, survey, of, her, recordings, was, released, in, several, volumes, on, the, simax, label, her, pre, war, recordings, which, show, her, voice, in, its, freshest, brilliance, and, clarity, include, studio, recordings, of, wagner, arias, beethoven, arias, and, grieg, songs, as, well, as, duets, from, lohengrin, parsifal, and, tristan, und, isolde, with, lauritz, melchior, these, have, been, reissued, on, compact, disc, by, rca, victor, as, well, as, on, naxos, preiser, and, romophone, many, metropolitan, opera, broadcasts, also, survive, and, have, circulated, among, collectors, and, more, recently, on, cd, these, include, after, world, war, ii, many, important, studio, recordings, followed, including, perhaps, her, most, famous, operatic, recording, is, the, 1952, tristan, with, furtw, ngler, which, has, never, been, out, of, print, it, is, available, from, emi, and, naxos, among, others, because, she, was, aged, 57, she, was, unsure, of, her, capacity, to, reach, the, top, cs, in, act, ii, and, agreed, to, elisabeth, schwarzkopf, providing, her, voice, for, this, purpose, another, two, tristan, s, of, note, are, two, live, performances, from, london, on, 18, may, and, 2, june, 1936, with, lauritz, melchior, as, tristan, emanuel, list, as, marke, sabine, kalter, as, brang, ne, and, herbert, janssen, as, kurwenal, conducted, by, fritz, reiner, leading, the, london, philharmonic, orchestra, and, from, the, teatro, col, n, buenos, aires, on, 20,

of, particular, historical, significance, in, 1956, she, moved, to, decca, where, in, the, autumn, of, her, career, further, important, studio, recordings, followed, almost, to, the, end, of, her,
