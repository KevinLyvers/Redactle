experiences, in, the, spanish, civil, war, neruda, like, many, left, leaning, intellectuals, of, his, generation, came, to, admire, the, soviet, union, of, joseph, stalin, he, did, so, partly, due, to, the, role, it, played, in, defeating, nazi, germany, and, partly, because, of, an, idealistic, interpretation, of, marxist, doctrine, this, sentiment, is, echoed, in, poems, such, as, canto, a, stalingrado, song, to, stalingrad, 1942, and, nuevo, canto, de, amor, a, stalingrado, new, love, song, to, stalingrad, 1943, in, 1953, neruda, was, awarded, the, stalin, peace, prize, upon, stalin, s,

fervent, stalinism, eventually, drove, a, wedge, between, neruda, and, his, long, time, friend, mexican, poet, octavio, paz, who, commented, that, neruda, became, more, and, more, stalinist, while, i, became, less, and, less, enchanted, with, stalin, their, differences, came, to, a, head, after, the, nazi, soviet, ribbentrop, molotov, pact, of, 1939, when, they, almost, came, to, blows, in, an, argument, over, stalin, although, paz, still, considered, neruda, the, greatest, poet, of, his, generation, in, an, essay, on, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, he, wrote, that, when, he, thinks, of, neruda, and, other, famous, stalinist, writers, and, poets, i, feel, the, gooseflesh, that, i, get, from, reading, certain, passages, of, the, inferno, no, doubt, they, began, in, good, faith, but, insensibly, commitment, by, commitment, they, saw, themselves, becoming, entangled, in, a, mesh, of, lies, falsehoods, deceits, and, perjuries, until, they, lost, their, souls, on, 15, july, 1945, at, pacaembu, stadium, in, s, o, paulo, brazil, neruda, read, to, 100, 000, people, in, honor, of, the, communist, revolutionary, leader, lu, s, carlos, prestes, neruda, hailed, vladimir, lenin, as, the, great, genius, of, this, century, in, a, speech, he, gave, on, 5, june, 1946, neruda, also, paid, tribute, to, the, late, soviet, leader, mikhail, kalinin, whom, neruda, regarded, as, a, man, of, noble, life, the, great, constructor, of, the, future, and, a, comrade, in, arms, of, lenin, and, stalin, neruda, later, came, to, regret, his, fondness, for, the, soviet, union, explaining, that, in, those, days, stalin, seemed, to, us, the, conqueror, who, had, crushed, hitler, s, armies, of, a, subsequent, visit, to, china, in, 1957, neruda, wrote, what, has, estranged, me, from, the, chinese, revolutionary, process, has, not, been, mao, tse, tung, but, mao, tse, tungism, he, labeled, this, mao, tse, stalinism, as, the, repetition, of, a, cult, of, a, socialist, deity, despite, his, disillusionment, with, stalin, neruda, never, lost, his, fundamental, faith, in, communist, theory, and, remained, loyal, to, the, communist, party, anxious, not, to, provide, ammunition, to, his, ideological, enemies, he, would, later, refuse, publicly, to, condemn, the, soviet, repression, of, dissident, writers, like, boris, pasternak, and, joseph, brodsky, an, attitude, with, which, even, some, of, his, staunchest, admirers, disagreed, on, 4, march, 1945, neruda, was, elected, as, a, communist, senator, representing, the, northern, provinces, of, antofagasta, and, tarapac, in, the,

to, act, as, his, campaign, manager, gonz, lez, videla, was, supported, by, a, coalition, of, left, wing, parties, and, neruda, fervently, campaigned, on, his, behalf, however, once, in, office, gonz, lez, videla, turned, against, the, communist, party, and, enacted, the, ley, de, defensa, permanente, de, la, democracia, law, of, permanent, defense, of, the, democracy, the, breaking, point, for, senator, neruda, was, the, violent, repression, of, a, communist, led, miners, strike, in, lota, in, october, 1947, when, striking, workers, were, herded, into, island, military, prisons, and, a, concentration, camp, in, the, town, of, pisagua, neruda, s, criticism, of, gonz, lez, videla, culminated, in, a, dramatic, speech, in, the, chilean, senate, on, 6, january, 1948, which, became, known,

canto, para, bol, var, a, song, for, bol, var, prior, to, this, he, shared, his, sentiments, in, this, painful, and, victorious, hour, that, the, peoples, of, the, americas, are, living, my, poem, with, changes, in, location, can, be, understood, as, directed, towards, fidel, castro, because, in, the, struggles, for, freedom, the, destiny, of, a, man, always, emerges, to, instill, confidence, in, the, spirit, of, greatness, in, the, history, of, our, nations, during, the, late, 1960s, argentine, writer, jorge, luis, borges, was, asked, for, his, opinion, on, neruda, borges, stated, i, think, of, him, as, a, very, fine, poet, a, very, fine, poet, i, don, t, admire, him, as, a, man, i, think, of, him, as, a, very, mean, man, he, said, that, neruda, had, not, spoken, out, against,

m, against, them, so, i, felt, he, was, behaving, very, wisely, in, avoiding, a, meeting, that, would, have, been, quite, uncomfortable, for, both, of, us, a, few, weeks, after, his, yo, acuso, speech, in, 1948, finding, himself, threatened, with, arrest, neruda, went, into, hiding, he, and, his, wife, were, smuggled, from, house, to, house, hidden, by, supporters, and, admirers, for, the,

a, different, edition, of, 5, 000, copies, was, boldly, published, in, chile, by, the, outlawed, communist, party, based, on, a, manuscript, neruda, had, left, behind, in, mexico, he, was, granted, honorary, mexican, citizenship, neruda, s, 1952, stay, in, a, villa, owned, by, italian, historian, edwin, cerio, on, the, island, of, capri, was, fictionalized, in, antonio, skarmeta, s, 1985, novel, ardiente, paciencia, ardent, patience, later, known, as, el, cartero, de, neruda, or, neruda, s, postman, which, inspired, the, popular, film, il, postino, 1994, by, 1952, the, gonz, lez, videla, government, was, on, its, last, legs, weakened, by, corruption, scandals, the, chilean, socialist, party, was, in, the, process, of, nominating, salvador, allende, as, its, candidate, for, the, september, 1952, presidential, elections, and, was, keen, to, have, the, presence, of, neruda, by, now, chile, s, most, prominent, left, wing, literary, figure, to, support, the, campaign, neruda, returned, to, chile, in, august, of, that, year, and, rejoined, delia, del, carril, who, had, traveled, ahead, of, him, some, months, earlier, but, the, marriage, was, crumbling, del, carril, eventually, learned, of, his, affair, with, matilde, urrutia, and, he, sent, her, back, to, chile, in, 1955, she, convinced, the, chilean, officials, to, lift, his, arrest, allowing, urrutia, and, neruda, to, go, to, capri, italy, now, united, with, urrutia, neruda, would, aside, from, many, foreign, trips, and, a, stint, as, allende, s, ambassador, to, france, from, 1970, to, 1973, spend, the, rest, of, his, life, in, chile, by, this, time, neruda, enjoyed, worldwide, fame, as, a, poet, and, his, books, were, being, translated, into, virtually, all, the, major, languages, of, the, world, he, vigorously, denounced, the, united, states, during, the, cuban, missile, crisis, and, later, in, the, decade, repeatedly, condemned, the, u, s, for, its, involvement, in, the, vietnam, war, but, being, one, of, the, most, prestigious, and, outspoken, left, wing, intellectuals, alive, he, also, attracted, opposition, from, ideological, opponents, the, congress, for, cultural, freedom, an, anti, communist, organization, covertly, established, and, funded, by, the, u, s, central, intelligence, agency, adopted, neruda, as, one, of, its, primary, targets, and, launched, a, campaign, to, undermine, his, reputation, reviving, the, old, claim, that, he, had, been, an, accomplice, in, the, attack, on, leon, trotsky, in, mexico, city, in, 1940, the, campaign, became, more, intense, when, it, became, known, that, neruda, was, a, candidate, for, the, 1964, nobel, prize, which, was, eventually, awarded, to, jean, paul, sartre, who, rejected, it, in, 1966, neruda, was, invited, to, attend, an, international, pen, conference, in, new, york, city, officially, he, was, barred, from, entering, the, u, s, because, he, was, a, communist, but, the, conference, organizer, playwright, arthur, miller, eventually, prevailed, upon, the, johnson, administration, to, grant, neruda, a, visa, neruda, gave, readings, to, packed, halls, and, even, recorded, some, poems, for, the, library, of, congress, miller, later, opined, that, neruda, s, adherence, to, his, communist, ideals, of, the, 1930s, was, a, result, of, his, protracted, exclusion, from, bourgeois, society, due, to, the, presence, of, many, eastern, bloc, writers, mexican, writer, carlos, fuentes, later, wrote, that, the, pen, conference, marked, a, beginning, of, the, end, of, the, cold, war, upon, neruda, s, return, to, chile, he, stopped, in, peru, where, he, gave, readings, to, enthusiastic, crowds, in, lima, and, arequipa, and, was, received, by, president, fernando, bela, nde, terry, however, this, visit, also, prompted, an, unpleasant, backlash, because, the, peruvian, government, had, come, out, against, the, government, of, fidel, castro, in, cuba, july, 1966, saw, more, than, 100, cuban, intellectuals, retaliate, against, the, poet, by, signing, a, letter, that, charged, neruda, with, colluding, with, the, enemy, calling, him, an, example, of, the, tepid, pro, yankee, revisionism, then, prevalent, in, latin, america, the, affair, was, particularly, painful, for, neruda, because, of, his, previous, outspoken, support, for, the, cuban, revolution, and, he, never, visited, the, island, again, even, after, receiving, an, invitation, in, 1968, after, the, death, of, che, guevara, in, bolivia, in, 1967, neruda, wrote, several, articles, regretting, the, loss, of, a, great, hero, at, the, same, time, he, told, his, friend, aida, figueroa, not, to, cry, for, che, but, for, luis, emilio, recabarren, the, father, of, the, chilean, communist, movement, who, preached, a, pacifist, revolution, over, che, s, violent, ways, in, 1970, neruda, was, nominated, as, a, candidate, for, the, chilean, presidency, but, ended, up, giving, his, support, to, salvador, allende, who, later, won, the, election, and, was, inaugurated, in, 1970, as, chile, s, first, democratically, elected, socialist, head, of, state, shortly, thereafter, allende, appointed, neruda, the, chilean, ambassador, to, france, lasting, from, 1970, to, 1972, his, final, diplomatic, posting, during, his, stint, in, paris, neruda, helped, to, renegotiate, the, external, debt, of, chile, billions, owed, to, european, and, american, banks, but, within, months, of, his, arrival, in, paris, his, health, began, to, deteriorate, neruda, returned, to, chile, two, and, a, half, years, later, due, to, his, failing, health, in, 1971, neruda, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, a, decision, that, did, not, come, easily, because, some, of, the, committee, members, had, not, forgotten, neruda, s, past, praise, of, stalinist, dictatorship, but, his, swedish, translator, artur, lundkvist, did, his, best, to, ensure, the, chilean, received, the, prize, a, poet, neruda, stated, in, his, stockholm, speech, of, acceptance, of, the, nobel, prize, is, at, the, same, time, a, force, for, solidarity, and, for, solitude, the, following, year, neruda, was, awarded, the, prestigious, golden, wreath, award, at, the, struga, poetry, evenings, as, the, coup, d, tat, of, 1973, unfolded, neruda, was, diagnosed, with, prostate, cancer, the, military, coup, led, by, general, augusto, pinochet, saw, neruda, s, hopes, for, chile, destroyed, shortly, thereafter, during, a, search, of, the, house, and, grounds, at, isla, negra, by, chilean, armed, forces, at, which, neruda, was, reportedly, present, the, poet, famously, remarked, look, around, there, s, only, one, thing, of, danger, for, you, here, poetry, it, was, originally, reported, that, on, the, evening, of, 23, september, 1973, at, santiago, s,

proceso, published, an, interview, with, his, former, driver, manuel, araya, osorio, in, which, he, states, that, he, was, present, when, neruda, called, his, wife, and, warned, that, he, believed,

amidst, a, massive, police, presence, and, mourners, took, advantage, of, the, occasion, to, protest, against, the, new, regime, established, just, a, couple, of, weeks, before, neruda, s, house, was, broken, into, and, his, papers, and, books, taken, or, destroyed, in, 1974, his, memoirs, appeared, under, the, title, i, confess, i, have, lived, updated, to, the, last, days, of, the, poet, s, life,

exhumation, in, april, 2013, eduardo, contreras, a, chilean, lawyer, who, was, leading, the, push, for, a, full, investigation, commented, we, have, world, class, labs, from, india, switzerland, germany, the, us, sweden, they, have, all, offered, to, do, the, lab, work, for, free, the, pablo, neruda, foundation, fought, the, exhumation, on, the, grounds, that, araya, s, claims, were,

killings, of, general, carlos, prats, buenos, aires, 1974, and, ex, chancellor, orlando, letelier, washington, 1976, the, chilean, government, suggested, that, the, 2015, test, showed, it, was, highly, probable, that, a, third, party, was, responsible, for, his, death, test, results, were, released, on, 8, november, 2013, of, the, seven, month, investigation, by, a, 15, member, forensic, team, patricio, bustos, the, head, of, chile, s, medical, legal, service, stated, no, relevant, chemical, substances, have, been, found, that, could, be, linked, to, mr, neruda, s, death, at, the, time, however, carroza, said, that, he, was, waiting, for, the, results, of, the, last, scientific, tests, conducted, in, may, 2015, which, found, that, neruda, was, infected, with, the, staphylococcus, aureus, bacterium, which, can, be, highly, toxic, and, result, in, death, if, modified, a, team, of, 16, international, experts, led, by, spanish, forensic, specialist, aurelio, luna, from, the, university, of, murcia, announced, on, 20, october, 2017, that, from, analysis, of, the, data, we, cannot, accept, that, the, poet, had, been, in, an, imminent, situation, of, death, at, the, moment, of, entering, the, hospital, and, that, death, from, prostate, cancer, was, not, likely, at, the, moment, when, he, died, the, team, also, discovered, something, in, neruda, s, remains, that, could, possibly, be, a, laboratory, cultivated, bacterium, the, results, of, their, continuing, analysis, were, expected, in, 2018, his, cause, of, death, was, in, fact, listed, as, a, heart, attack, scientists, who, exhumed, neruda, s, body, in, 2013, also, supported, claims, that, he, was, suffering, from, prostate, cancer, when, he, died, in, 2023, a, team, from, mcmaster, university, and, the, university, of, copenhagen, confirmed, the, presence, of, the, clostridium, botulinum, bacteria, in, neruda, s, bloodstream, although, it, is, not, clear, if, this, contributed, to, his, death, mcmaster, researcher, debi, poinar, noted, that, if, neruda, had, died, of, botulism, he, would, ve, suffered, paralysis, or, septicemia, a, serious, blood, infection, the, bacteria, was, found, to, have, been, mainly, concentrated, in, one, of, neruda, s, molars, some, scientists, involved, in, the, testing, also, spoke, with, deutsche, welle, to, deny, the, family, s, claim, that, the, testing, confirmed, he, was, poisoned, despite, at, times, being, used, as, a, biological, weapon, the, bacteria, also, has, a, long, history, of, being, present, in, food, products, such, as, fruit, vegetables, seafood, and, canned, food, and, at, times, has, been, even, used, for, medical, treatment, john, austin, who, leads, the, botulism, reference, service, for, canada, also, told, deutsche, welle, that, the, mere, presence, of, c, botulinum, is, not, harmful, to, humans, and, that, it, the, harm, that, comes, from, it, is, the, toxins, it, produces, when, it, grows, austin, further, stated, the, bacteria, in, neruda, s, mouth, could, ve, even, expanded, after, he, died, as, it, is, common, for, bacteria, to, multiply, in, the, body, among, people, after, they, die, fabrizio, anniballi, another, botulism, expert, who, was, not, directly, involved, in, the, research, on, neruda, s, remains, further, noted, it, was, too, unlikely, that, the, injection, he, was, alleged, to, been, given, into, belly, gave, him, botulism, noting, that, it, was, also, claimed, he, died, a, mere, six, hours, it, happened, which, is, not, a, feasible, amount, of, time, to, trigger, botulism, debi, poinar, also, acknowledged, to, deutsche, welle, that, while, some, c, botulinum, was, found, in, neruda, s, bones, it, had, yet, to, be, discerned, whether, it, was, from, the, same, source, as, that, found, in, the, molar, in, november, 2018, the, cultural, committee, of, chile, s, lower, house, voted, in, favor, of, renaming, santiago, s, main, airport, after, neruda,

maid, in, 1929, in, ceylon, sri, lanka, several, feminist, groups, bolstered, by, a, growing, metoo, and, anti, femicide, movement, stated, that, neruda, should, not, be, honored, by, his, country,
