isidore, auguste, marie, fran, ois, xavier, comte, french, 19, january, 1798, 30, september, 1857, was, a, french, philosopher, mathematician, and, writer, who, formulated, the, doctrine, of, positivism, he, is, often, regarded, as, the, first, philosopher, of, science, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, comte, s, ideas, were, also, fundamental, to, the, development, of, sociology, with, him, inventing, the, very, term, and, treating, the, discipline, as, the, crowning, achievement, of, the, sciences, influenced, by, henri, de, saint, simon, comte, s, work, attempted, to, remedy, the, social, disorder, caused, by, the, french, revolution, which, he, believed, indicated, imminent, transition, to, a, new, form, of, society, he, sought, to, establish, a, new, social, doctrine, based, on, science, which, he, labelled, positivism, he, had, a, major, impact, on, 19th, century, thought, influencing, the, work, of, social, thinkers, such, as, john, stuart, mill, and, george, eliot, his, concept, of, sociologie, and, social, evolutionism, set, the, tone, for, early, social, theorists, and, anthropologists, such, as, harriet, martineau, and, herbert, spencer, evolving, into, modern, academic, sociology, presented, by, mile, durkheim, as, practical, and, objective, social, research, comte, s, social, theories, culminated, in, his, religion, of, humanity, which, presaged, the, development, of, non, theistic, religious, humanist, and, secular, humanist, organisations, in, the, 19th, century, he, may, also, have, coined, the, word, altruisme, altruism, auguste, comte, was, born, in, montpellier, h, rault, on, 19, january, 1798, at, the, time, under, the, rule, of, the, newly, founded, french, first, republic, after, attending, the, lyc, e, joffre, and, then, the, university, of, montpellier, comte, was, admitted, to, cole, polytechnique, in, paris, the, cole, polytechnique, was, notable, for, its, adherence, to, the, french, ideals, of, republicanism, and, progress, the, cole, closed, in, 1816, for, reorganization, and, comte, continued, his, studies, at, the, medical, school, at, montpellier, when, the, cole, polytechnique, reopened, he, did, not, request, readmission, following, his, return, to, montpellier, comte, soon, came, to, see, unbridgeable, differences, with, his, catholic, and, monarchist, family, and, set, off, again, for, paris, earning, money, by, small, jobs, comte, had, abandoned, catholicism, under, the, influence, of, his, first, teacher, and, protestant, pastor, daniel, encontre, in, august, 1817, he, found, an, apartment, at, 36, rue, bonaparte, in, paris, s, 6th, arrondissement, where, he, lived, until, 1822, and, later, that, year, he, became, a, student, and, secretary, to, henri, de, saint, simon, who, brought, comte, into, contact, with, intellectual, society, and, greatly, influenced, his, thought, therefrom, during, that, time, comte, published, his, first, essays, in, the, various, publications, headed, by, saint, simon, l, industrie, le, politique, and, l, organisateur, charles, dunoyer, and, charles, comte, s, le, censeur, europ, en, although, he, would, not, publish, under, his, own, name, until, 1819, s, la, s, paration, g, n, rale, entre, les, opinions, et, les, d, sirs, the, general, separation, of, opinions, and, desires, in, 1824, comte, left, saint, simon, again, because, of, unbridgeable, differences, comte, published, a, plan, de, travaux, scientifiques, n, cessaires, pour, r, organiser, la, soci, t, 1822, plan, of, scientific, studies, necessary, for, the, reorganization, of, society, but, he, failed, to, get, an, academic, post, his, day, to, day, life, depended, on, sponsors, and, financial, help, from, friends, debates, rage, as, to, how, much, comte, appropriated, the, work, of, saint, simon, comte, married, caroline, massin, in, 1825, in, 1826, he, was, taken, to, a, mental, health, hospital, but, left, without, being, cured, only, stabilized, by, french, alienist, jean, tienne, dominique, esquirol, so, that, he, could, work, again, on, his, plan, he, would, later, attempt, suicide, in, 1827, by, jumping, off, the, pont, des, arts, in, the, time, between, this, and, their, divorce, in, 1842, he, published, the, six, volumes, of, his, cours, comte, developed, a, close, friendship, with, john, stuart, mill, from, 1844, he, fell, deeply, in, love, with, the, catholic, clotilde, de, vaux, although, because, she, was, not, divorced, from, her, first, husband, their, love, was, never, consummated, after, her, death, in, 1846, this, love, became, quasi, religious, and, comte, working, closely, with, mill, who, was, refining, his, own, such, system, developed, a, new, religion, of, humanity, john, kells, ingram, an, adherent, of, comte, visited, him, in, paris, in, 1855, he, published, four, volumes, of, syst, me, de, politique, positive, 1851, 1854, his, final, work, the, first, volume, of, la, synth, se, subjective, the, subjective, synthesis, was, published, in, 1856, comte, died, in, paris, on, 5, september, 1857, from, stomach, cancer, and, was, buried, in, the, famous, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, surrounded, by, cenotaphs, in, memory, of, his, mother, rosalie, boyer, and, of, clotilde, de, vaux, his, apartment, from, 1841, to, 1857, is, now, conserved, as, the, maison, d, auguste, comte, and, is, located, at, 10, rue, monsieur, le, prince, in, paris, 6th, arrondissement, comte, first, described, the, epistemological, perspective, of, positivism, in, the, course, in, positive, philosophy, a, series, of, texts, published, between, 1830, and, 1842, these, texts, were, followed, by, the, 1848, work, a, general, view, of, positivism, published, in, english, in, 1865, the, first, 3, volumes, of, the, course, dealt, chiefly, with, the, physical, sciences, already, in, existence, mathematics, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, whereas, the, latter, two, emphasised, the, inevitable, coming, of, social, science, observing, the, circular, dependence, of, theory, and, observation, in, science, and, classifying, the, sciences, in, this, way, comte, may, be, regarded, as, the, first, philosopher, of, science, in, the, modern, sense, of, the, term, comte, was, also, the, first, to, distinguish, natural, philosophy, from, science, explicitly, for, him, the, physical, sciences, had, necessarily, to, arrive, first, before, humanity, could, adequately, channel, its, efforts, into, the, most, challenging, and, complex, queen, science, of, human, society, itself, his, work, view, of, positivism, would, therefore, set, out, to, define, in, more, detail, the, empirical, goals, of, the, sociological, method, comte, offered, an, account, of, social, evolution, proposing, that, society, undergoes, three, phases, in, its, quest, for, the, truth, according, to, a, general, law, of, three, stages, comte, s, stages, were, 1, the, theological, stage, 2, the, metaphysical, stage, and, 3, the, positive, stage, comte, s, law, of, three, stages, was, one, of, the, first, theories, of, social, evolutionism, he, once, wrote, it, is, evident, the, solar, system, is, badly, designed, the, other, universal, law, he, called, the, encyclopedic, law, by, combining, these, laws, comte, developed, a, systematic, and, hierarchical, classification, of, all, sciences, including, inorganic, physics, astronomy, earth, science, and, chemistry, and, organic, physics, biology, and, for, the, first, time, physique, sociale, later, renamed, sociologie, independently, from, emmanuel, joseph, siey, s, s, introduction, of, the, term, in, 1780, comte, re, invented, sociologie, and, introduced, the, term, as, a, neologism, in, 1838, comte, had, earlier, used, the, term, social, physics, but, that, term, had, been, appropriated, by, others, notably, by, adolphe, quetelet, the, most, important, thing, to, determine, was, the, natural, order, in, which, the, sciences, stand, not, how, they, can, be, made, to, stand, but, how, they, must, stand, irrespective, of, the, wishes, of, anyone, this, comte, accomplished, by, taking, as, the, criterion, of, the, position, of, each, the, degree, of, what, he, called, positivity, which, is, simply, the, degree, to, which, the, phenomena, can, be, exactly, determined, this, as, may, be, readily, seen, is, also, a, measure, of, their, relative, complexity, since, the, exactness, of, a, science, is, in, inverse, proportion, to, its, complexity, the, degree, of, exactness, or, positivity, is, moreover, that, to, which, it, can, be, subjected, to, mathematical, demonstration, and, therefore, mathematics, which, is, not, itself, a, concrete, science, is, the, general, gauge, by, which, the, position, of, every, science, is, to, be, determined, generalizing, thus, comte, found, that, there, were, five, great, groups, of, phenomena, of, equal, classificatory, value, but, of, successively, decreasing, positivity, to, these, he, gave, the, names, astronomy, physics, chemistry, biology, and, sociology, this, idea, of, a, special, science, not, the, humanities, not, metaphysics, for, the, social, was, prominent, in, the, 19th, century, and, not, unique, to, comte, it, has, recently, been, discovered, that, the, term, sociology, as, a, term, considered, coined, by, comte, had, already, been, introduced, in, 1780, albeit, with, a, different, meaning, by, the, french, essayist, emmanuel, joseph, siey, s, 1748, 1836, the, ambitious, or, many, would, say, grandiose, ways, that, comte, conceived, of, this, special, science, of, the, social, however, was, unique, comte, saw, this, new, science, sociology, as, the, last, and, greatest, of, all, sciences, one, which, would, include, all, other, sciences, and, integrate, and, relate, their, findings, into, a, cohesive, whole, it, has, to, be, pointed, out, however, that, he, noted, a, seventh, science, one, even, greater, than, sociology, namely, comte, considered, anthropology, or, true, science, of, man, the, last, gradation, in, the, grand, hierarchy, of, abstract, science, comte, s, explanation, of, the, positive, philosophy, introduced, the, important, relationship, between, theory, practice, and, human, understanding, of, the, world, on, page, 27, of, the, 1855, printing, of, harriet, martineau, s, translation, of, the, positive, philosophy, of, auguste, comte, we, see, his, observation, that, if, it, is, true, that, every, theory, must, be, based, upon, observed, facts, it, is, equally, true, that, facts, can, not, be, observed, without, the, guidance, of, some, theories, without, such, guidance, our, facts, would, be, desultory, and, fruitless, we, could, not, retain, them, for, the, most, part, we, could, not, even, perceive, them, comte, s, emphasis, on, the, interconnectedness, of, social, elements, was, a, forerunner, of, modern, functionalism, nevertheless, as, with, many, others, of, comte, s, time, certain, elements, of, his, work, are, now, viewed, as, eccentric, and, unscientific, and, his, grand, vision, of, sociology, as, the, centerpiece, of, all, the, sciences, has, not, come, to, fruition, his, emphasis, on, a, quantitative, mathematical, basis, for, decision, making, remains, with, us, today, it, is, a, foundation, of, the, modern, notion, of, positivism, modern, quantitative, statistical, analysis, and, business, decision, making, his, description, of, the, continuing, cyclical, relationship, between, theory, and, practice, is, seen, in, modern, business, systems, of, total, quality, management, tqm, and, continuous, quality, improvement, where, advocates, describe, a, continuous, cycle, of, theory, and, practice, through, the, four, part, cycle, of, plan, do, check, act, pdca, the, shewhart, cycle, despite, his, advocacy, of, quantitative, analysis, comte, saw, a, limit, in, its, ability, to, help, explain, social, phenomena, the, early, sociology, of, herbert, spencer, came, about, broadly, as, a, reaction, to, comte, writing, after, various, developments, in, evolutionary, biology, spencer, attempted, to, reformulate, the, discipline, in, what, we, might, now, describe, as, socially, darwinistic, terms, comte, s, fame, today, owes, in, part, to, mile, littr, who, founded, the, positivist, review, in, 1867, auguste, comte, did, not, create, the, idea, of, sociology, the, study, of, society, patterns, of, social, relationships, social, interaction, and, culture, but, instead, he, expanded, it, greatly, positivism, the, principle, of, conducting, sociology, through, empiricism, and, the, scientific, method, was, the, primary, way, that, comte, studied, sociology, he, split, sociology, into, two, different, areas, of, study, one, social, statics, how, society, holds, itself, together, and, two, social, dynamics, the, study, of, the, causes, of, societal, changes, he, saw, these, areas, as, parts, of, the, same, system, comte, compared, society, and, sociology, to, the, human, body, and, anatomy, comte, ascribed, the, functions, of, connection, and, boundaries, to, the, social, structures, of, language, religion, and, division, of, labor, through, language, everybody, in, society, both, past, and, present, can, communicate, with, each, other, religion, unites, society, under, a, common, belief, system, and, functions, in, harmony, under, a, system, finally, the, division, of, labor, allows, everyone, in, society, to, depend, upon, each, other, comte, is, often, disregarded, when, talking, about, utopia, however, he, made, many, contributions, to, utopian, literature, and, influenced, the, modern, day, debate, some, intellectuals, allude, to, the, fact, that, the, utopian, system, of, modern, life, served, as, a, catalyst, for, various, world, making, activities, during, the, nineteenth, and, early, twentieth, centuries, willson, m, 2019, in, this, utopian, project, comte, introduces, three, major, concepts, altruism, sociocracy, and, the, religion, of, humanity, in, the, 19th, century, comte, coined, altruism, as, a, theory, of, conduct, that, regards, the, good, of, others, as, the, end, of, moral, action, britannica, t, 2013, furthermore, comte, explains, sociocracy, as, the, governance, by, people, who, know, each, other, friends, or, allies, after, the, french, revolution, comte, was, looking, for, a, rational, basis, for, government, after, developing, the, positivism, philosophy, he, developed, sociocracy, to, the, scientific, method, of, the, government, in, later, years, comte, developed, the, religion, of, humanity, for, positivist, societies, to, fulfil, the, cohesive, function, once, held, by, traditional, worship, in, 1849, he, proposed, a, calendar, reform, called, the, positivist, calendar, for, close, associate, john, stuart, mill, it, was, possible, to, distinguish, between, a, good, comte, the, author, of, the, course, in, positive, philosophy, and, a, bad, comte, the, author, of, the, secular, religious, system, the, system, was, unsuccessful, but, met, with, the, publication, of, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, 1859, to, influence, the, proliferation, of, various, secular, humanist, organizations, in, the, 19th, century, especially, through, the, work, of, secularists, such, as, george, holyoake, and, richard, congreve, although, comte, s, english, followers, including, george, eliot, and, harriet, martineau, for, the, most, part, rejected, the, full, gloomy, panoply, of, his, system, they, liked, the, idea, of, a, religion, of, humanity, and, his, injunction, to, vivre, pour, autrui, live, for, others, from, which, comes, the, word, altruism, comte, was, agitated, by, the, fact, that, no, one, had, synthesized, physics, chemistry, and, biology, into, a, coherent, system, of, ideas, so, he, began, an, attempt, to, reasonably, deduce, facts, about, the, social, world, from, the, use, of, the, sciences, through, his, studies, he, concluded, that, the, growth, of, the, human, mind, progresses, in, stages, and, so, must, societies, he, claimed, the, history, of, society, could, be, divided, into, three, different, stages, theological, metaphysical, and, positive, the, law, of, three, stages, an, evolutionary, theory, describes, how, the, history, of, societies, is, split, into, three, sections, due, to, new, thoughts, on, philosophy, comte, believed, that, evolution, was, the, growth, of, the, human, mind, splitting, into, stages, and, evolving, through, these, stages, comte, concluded, that, society, acts, similarly, to, the, mind, the, law, is, this, that, each, of, our, leading, conceptions, each, branch, of, our, knowledge, passes, successively, through, three, different, theoretical, conditions, the, theological, or, fictitious, the, metaphysical, or, abstract, and, the, scientific, or, positive, the, law, of, three, stages, is, the, evolution, of, society, in, which, the, stages, have, already, occurred, or, are, currently, developing, the, reason, why, there, are, newly, developed, stages, after, a, certain, time, period, is, that, the, system, has, lost, its, power, and, is, preventing, the, progression, of, civilization, causing, complicated, situations, in, society, lenzer, 1975, pg, 10, the, only, way, to, escape, the, situation, is, for, people, within, the, civilized, nations, to, turn, towards, an, organic, new, social, system, comte, refers, to, kings, to, show, the, complications, of, re, establishment, in, society, kings, feel, the, need, to, reorganize, their, kingdom, but, many, fail, to, succeed, because, they, do, not, consider, that, the, progress, of, civilization, needs, reform, not, perceiving, that, there, is, nothing, more, perfect, than, inserting, a, new, more, harmonious, system, kings, fail, to, see, the, effectiveness, of, abandoning, old, systems, because, they, do, not, understand, the, nature, of, the, present, crisis, but, in, order, to, progress, there, need, to, be, the, necessary, consequences, that, come, with, it, which, is, caused, by, a, series, of, modifications, independent, of, the, human, will, to, which, all, classes, of, society, contributed, and, of, which, kings, themselves, have, often, been, the, first, agents, and, most, eager, promoters, the, people, themselves, have, the, ability, to, produce, a, new, system, this, pattern, is, shown, through, the, theological, stage, metaphysical, stage, and, positive, stage, the, law, of, three, stages, is, split, into, stages, much, like, how, the, human, mind, changes, from, stage, to, stage, the, three, stages, are, the, theological, stage, the, metaphysical, stage, and, the, positive, stage, also, known, as, the, law, of, three, stages, the, theological, stage, happened, before, the, 1300s, in, which, all, societies, lived, a, life, that, was, completely, theocentric, the, metaphysical, stage, was, when, the, society, seeks, universal, rights, and, freedom, with, the, third, and, final, stage, the, positive, stage, comte, takes, a, stand, on, the, question, how, should, the, relations, among, philosophy, of, science, history, of, science, and, sociology, of, science, be, seen, he, says, that, sociology, and, history, are, not, mutually, exclusive, but, that, history, is, the, method, of, sociology, thus, he, calls, sociology, the, final, science, this, positive, stage, was, to, solve, social, problems, and, forcing, these, social, problems, to, be, fixed, without, care, for, the, will, of, god, or, human, rights, comte, finds, that, these, stages, can, be, seen, across, different, societies, across, all, of, history, the, first, stage, the, theological, stage, relies, on, supernatural, or, religious, explanations, of, the, phenomena, of, human, behavior, because, the, human, mind, in, its, search, for, the, primary, and, final, causes, of, phenomena, explains, the, apparent, anomalies, in, the, universe, as, interventions, of, supernatural, agents, the, theological, stage, is, the, necessary, starting, point, of, human, intelligence, when, humans, turn, to, supernatural, agents, as, the, cause, of, all, phenomena, in, this, stage, humans, focus, on, discovering, absolute, knowledge, comte, disapproved, of, this, stage, because, it, turned, to, simple, explanation, humans, created, in, their, minds, that, all, phenomena, were, caused, by, supernatural, agents, rather, than, human, reason, and, experience, comte, refers, to, bacon, s, philosophy, that, there, can, be, no, real, knowledge, except, that, which, rests, upon, observed, facts, but, he, observes, that, the, primitive, mind, could, not, have, thought, that, way, because, it, would, have, only, created, a, vicious, circle, between, observations, and, theories, for, if, on, the, one, hand, every, positive, theory, must, necessarily, be, founded, upon, observations, it, is, on, the, other, hand, no, less, true, that, in, order, to, observe, our, mind, has, need, of, some, theory, or, other, because, the, human, mind, could, not, have, thought, in, that, way, in, the, origin, of, human, knowledge, comte, claims, that, humans, would, have, been, incapable, of, remembering, facts, and, would, not, have, escaped, the, circle, if, it, were, not, for, theological, conceptions, which, were, less, complicated, explanations, to, human, life, although, comte, disliked, this, stage, he, explains, that, theology, was, necessary, at, the, beginning, of, the, developing, primitive, mind, the, first, theological, state, is, the, necessary, starting, point, of, human, intelligence, the, human, mind, primarily, focuses, its, attention, on, the, inner, nature, of, beings, and, to, the, first, and, final, causes, of, all, phenomena, it, observes, ferre, 2, this, means, that, the, mind, is, looking, for, the, cause, and, effect, of, an, action, that, will, govern, the, social, world, therefore, it, represents, these, phenomena, as, being, produced, by, a, direct, and, continuous, action, of, more, or, less, numerous, supernatural, agents, whose, arbitrary, interventions, explain, all, the, apparent, anomalies, of, the, universe, ferre, 2, this, primary, subset, of, the, theological, state, is, known, as, fetishism, where, the, phenomena, must, be, caused, and, created, by, a, theological, supernatural, being, such, as, god, making, humans, view, every, event, in, the, universe, as, a, direct, will, from, these, supernatural, agents, some, people, believed, in, souls, or, spirits, that, possessed, inanimate, objects, and, practiced, animism, these, natural, spiritual, beings, who, possessed, souls, and, may, exist, apart, from, the, material, bodies, were, capable, of, interacting, with, humans, therefore, requiring, sacrifices, and, worship, to, please, the, agents, with, all, these, new, reasons, behind, phenomena, numerous, fetishisms, occur, needing, several, gods, to, continue, to, explain, events, people, begin, to, believe, that, every, object, or, event, has, a, unique, god, attached, to, it, this, belief, is, called, polytheism, the, mind, substituted, the, providential, action, of, a, single, being, for, the, varied, play, of, numerous, independent, gods, which, have, been, imagined, by, the, primitive, mind, these, gods, often, took, on, both, human, and, animal, resemblance, in, egypt, there, were, multiple, gods, with, animal, body, parts, such, as, ra, who, had, the, head, of, a, hawk, and, had, sun, associations, with, the, egyptians, the, polytheistic, greeks, had, several, gods, such, as, poseidon, who, controlled, the, sea, and, demeter, who, was, the, goddess, of, fertility, however, with, all, these, new, gods, governing, the, phenomena, of, society, the, brain, can, get, confused, with, the, numerous, gods, it, needs, to, remember, the, human, mind, eliminates, this, problem, by, believing, in, a, sub, stage, called, monotheism, rather, than, having, multiple, gods, there, is, simply, one, all, knowing, and, omnipotent, god, who, is, the, center, of, power, controlling, the, world, this, creates, harmony, with, the, universe, because, everything, is, under, one, ruler, this, leaves, no, confusion, of, how, to, act, or, who, is, the, superior, ruler, out, of, the, several, gods, seen, in, polytheism, the, theological, state, functions, well, as, the, first, state, of, the, mind, when, making, a, belief, about, an, event, because, it, creates, a, temporary, placeholder, for, the, cause, of, the, action, which, can, later, be, replaced, by, allowing, the, brain, to, think, of, the, reason, behind, phenomena, the, polytheistic, gods, are, fillers, that, can, be, replaced, by, monotheistic, gods, the, theological, stage, shows, how, the, primitive, mind, views, supernatural, phenomena, and, how, it, defines, and, sorts, the, causes, the, earliest, progress, of, the, human, mind, could, only, have, been, produced, by, the, theological, method, the, only, method, which, can, develop, spontaneously, it, alone, has, the, important, property, of, offering, us, a, provisional, theory, which, immediately, groups, the, first, facts, with, its, help, by, cultivating, our, capacity, for, observation, we, were, able, to, prepare, the, age, of, a, wholly, positive, philosophy, comte, 149, comte, believed, the, theological, stage, was, necessary, because, of, the, foundational, belief, that, man, s, earliest, philosophy, of, explanation, is, the, act, of, connecting, phenomena, around, him, to, his, own, actions, that, man, may, apply, the, study, of, external, nature, to, his, own, this, first, stage, is, necessary, to, remove, mankind, from, the, vicious, circle, in, which, it, was, confined, by, the, two, necessities, of, observing, first, in, order, to, form, conceptions, and, of, forming, theories, first, in, order, to, observe, additionally, the, theological, stage, is, able, to, organize, society, by, directing, the, first, social, organization, as, it, first, forms, a, system, of, common, opinions, and, by, forming, such, a, system, though, according, to, comte, it, could, not, last, this, stage, was, able, to, establish, an, intellectual, unity, that, made, an, impressive, political, system, the, theological, state, was, also, necessary, for, human, progress, on, account, that, it, creates, a, class, in, a, society, dedicated, to, speculative, activity, it, is, in, this, way, that, comte, sees, the, theological, stage, continue, to, exist, into, the, enlightenment, comte, momentarily, admires, the, theological, stage, for, its, remarkable, ability, to, enact, this, activity, amidst, a, time, when, it, was, argued, to, be, impractical, it, is, to, this, stage, that, the, human, mind, owes, the, first, effectual, separation, between, theory, and, practice, which, could, take, place, in, no, other, manner, other, than, through, the, institution, provided, by, the, theological, stage, the, theological, stage, is, the, stage, that, was, seen, primarily, among, the, civilizations, in, the, distant, past, having, been, used, before, the, 1300s, this, is, a, very, basic, view, of, the, world, with, little, to, no, involvement, in, the, world, of, science, and, a, world, of, illusions, and, delusions, as, freud, would, put, it, to, seek, the, nature, of, all, beings, mankind, puts, its, focus, on, sentiments, feelings, and, emotions, this, turned, mankind, towards, theology, and, the, creation, of, gods, to, answer, all, their, questions, the, theological, stage, is, broken, into, three, sections, the, second, stage, the, metaphysical, stage, is, merely, a, modification, of, the, first, because, a, supernatural, cause, is, replaced, by, an, abstract, entity, it, is, meant, to, be, a, transitional, stage, where, there, is, the, belief, that, abstract, forces, control, the, behavior, of, human, beings, because, it, is, a, transitional, stage, between, the, theological, stage, and, the, positive, stage, comte, deemed, it, the, least, important, of, the, three, stages, and, was, only, necessary, because, the, human, mind, cannot, make, the, jump, from, the, theological, to, the, positive, stage, on, its, own, the, metaphysical, stage, is, the, transitional, stage, because, theology, and, physics, are, so, profoundly, incompatible, and, their, conceptions, are, so, radically, opposed, in, character, human, intelligence, must, have, a, gradual, transition, other, than, this, comte, says, that, there, is, no, other, use, for, this, stage, although, it, is, the, least, important, stage, it, is, necessary, because, humans, could, not, handle, the, significant, change, in, thought, from, theological, to, positivity, the, metaphysical, stage, is, just, a, slight, modification, of, the, previous, stage, when, people, believed, in, the, abstract, forces, rather, than, the, supernatural, the, mind, begins, to, notice, the, facts, themselves, caused, by, the, emptiness, of, the, metaphysical, agents, through, over, subtle, qualification, that, all, right, minded, persons, considered, them, to, be, only, the, abstract, names, of, the, phenomena, in, question, the, mind, becomes, familiar, with, concepts, wanting, to, seek, more, and, therefore, is, prepared, to, move, into, the, positive, stage, in, understanding, comte, s, argument, it, is, important, to, note, that, comte, explains, the, theological, and, positive, stages, first, and, only, then, returns, to, explain, the, metaphysical, stage, his, rationale, in, this, decision, is, that, any, intermediate, state, can, be, judged, only, after, a, precise, analysis, of, two, extremes, only, upon, arrival, to, the, rational, positive, state, can, the, metaphysical, state, be, analyzed, serving, only, a, purpose, of, aiding, in, the, transition, from, the, theological, to, a, positive, state, furthermore, this, state, reconciles, for, a, time, the, radical, opposition, of, the, other, two, adapting, itself, to, the, gradual, decline, of, the, one, and, the, preparatory, rise, of, the, other, therefore, the, transition, between, the, two, states, is, almost, unperceivable, unlike, its, predecessor, and, successor, the, metaphysical, state, does, not, have, a, strong, intellectual, foundation, nor, social, power, for, a, political, organization, rather, it, simply, serves, to, guide, man, until, the, transition, from, imaginative, theological, state, to, rational, positive, state, is, complete, the, last, stage, the, positive, stage, is, when, the, mind, stops, searching, for, the, cause, of, phenomena, and, realizes, that, laws, exist, to, govern, human, behavior, and, that, this, stage, can, be, explained, rationally, with, the, use, of, reason, and, observation, both, of, which, are, used, to, study, the, social, world, this, stage, relies, on, science, rational, thought, and, empirical, laws, comte, believed, that, this, study, of, sociology, he, created, was, the, science, that, after, all, the, others, and, as, the, final, science, it, must, assume, the, task, of, coordinating, the, development, of, the, whole, of, knowledge, because, it, organized, all, of, human, behavior, the, final, most, evolved, stage, is, the, positivist, stage, the, stage, when, humans, give, up, on, discovering, absolute, truth, and, turn, towards, discovering, through, reasoning, and, observation, actual, laws, of, phenomena, humans, realize, that, laws, exist, and, that, the, world, can, be, rationally, explained, through, science, rational, thought, laws, and, observation, comte, was, a, positivist, believing, in, the, natural, rather, than, the, supernatural, and, so, he, claimed, that, his, time, period, the, 1800s, was, in, the, positivist, stage, he, believed, that, within, this, stage, there, is, a, hierarchy, of, sciences, mathematics, astronomy, terrestrial, physics, chemistry, and, physiology, mathematics, the, science, that, relates, to, the, measurement, of, magnitudes, is, the, most, perfect, science, of, all, and, is, applied, to, the, most, important, laws, of, the, universe, astronomy, is, the, most, simple, science, and, is, the, first, to, be, subjected, to, positive, theories, physics, is, less, satisfactory, than, astronomy, because, it, is, more, complex, having, less, pure, and, systemized, theories, physics, as, well, as, chemistry, are, the, general, laws, of, the, inorganic, world, and, are, harder, to, distinguish, physiology, completes, the, system, of, natural, sciences, and, is, the, most, important, of, all, sciences, because, it, is, the, only, solid, basis, of, the, social, reorganization, that, must, terminate, the, crisis, in, which, the, most, civilized, nations, have, found, themselves, this, stage, will, fix, the, problems, in, current, nations, allowing, progression, and, peace, it, is, through, observation, that, humanity, is, able, to, gather, knowledge, the, only, way, within, society, to, gather, evidence, and, build, upon, what, we, do, not, already, know, to, strengthen, society, is, to, observe, and, experience, our, situational, surroundings, in, the, positive, state, the, mind, stops, looking, for, causes, of, phenomena, and, limits, itself, strictly, to, laws, governing, them, likewise, absolute, notions, are, replaced, by, relative, ones, the, imperfection, of, humanity, is, not, a, result, of, the, way, we, think, rather, our, perspective, that, guides, the, way, we, think, comte, expresses, the, idea, that, we, have, to, open, our, eyes, to, different, ideas, and, ways, to, evaluate, our, surroundings, such, as, focusing, outside, of, the, simple, facts, and, abstract, ideas, but, instead, dive, into, the, supernatural, this, does, not, make, mean, that, what, is, around, us, is, not, critical, to, look, out, for, as, our, observations, are, critical, assets, to, our, thinking, the, things, that, are, lost, or, knowledge, that, is, in, the, past, are, still, relevant, to, recent, knowledge, it, is, what, is, before, our, time, that, guides, why, things, are, the, way, they, are, today, we, would, always, be, relying, on, our, own, facts, and, would, never, hypothesize, to, reveal, the, supernatural, if, we, do, not, observe, observing, strives, to, further, our, thinking, processes, according, to, comte, the, dead, govern, the, living, which, is, likely, a, reference, to, the, cumulative, nature, of, positivism, and, the, fact, that, our, current, world, is, shaped, by, the, actions, and, discoveries, of, those, who, came, before, us, as, this, is, true, the, observations, only, relevant, to, humanity, and, not, abstractly, related, to, humanity, are, distinct, and, seen, situationally, the, situation, leads, to, human, observation, as, a, reflection, of, the, tension, in, society, can, be, reviewed, overall, helping, to, enhance, knowledge, development, upon, our, observation, skills, our, thinking, shifts, as, thinkers, and, observers, we, switch, from, trying, to, identify, truth, and, turn, toward, the, rationality, and, reason, nature, brings, giving, us, the, ability, to, observe, this, distinct, switch, takes, on, the, transition, from, the, abstract, to, the, supernatural, comte, s, classification, of, the, sciences, was, based, upon, the, hypothesis, that, the, sciences, had, developed, from, the, understanding, of, simple, and, abstract, principles, to, the, understanding, of, complex, and, concrete, phenomena, instead, of, taking, what, we, believe, to, be, true, we, turn, it, around, to, use, the, phenomena, of, science, and, the, observation, of, natural, law, to, justify, what, we, believe, to, be, true, within, society, the, condensing, and, formulation, of, human, knowledge, is, what, comte, drives, us, toward, to, ultimately, build, the, strongest, society, possible, if, scientists, do, not, take, the, chance, to, research, why, a, certain, animal, species, are, going, distinct, and, their, facts, researched, by, those, in, the, past, are, no, longer, true, of, the, present, how, is, the, data, supposed, to, grow, how, are, we, to, gain, more, knowledge, these, facts, of, life, are, valuable, but, it, is, beyond, these, facts, that, comte, gestures, us, to, look, to, instead, of, the, culmination, of, facts, with, little, sufficiency, knowledge, altogether, takes, on, its, role, in, the, realm, of, science, in, connection, to, science, comte, relates, to, science, in, two, specific, fields, to, rebuild, the, construction, of, human, knowledge, as, science, is, broad, comte, reveals, this, scientific, classification, for, the, sake, of, thinking, and, the, future, organization, of, society, comte, divided, sociology, into, two, main, fields, or, branches, social, statistics, or, the, study, of, the, forces, that, hold, society, together, and, social, dynamics, or, the, study, of, the, causes, of, social, change, in, doing, this, society, is, reconstructed, by, reconstructing, human, thinking, and, observation, societal, operation, alters, the, attention, is, drawn, to, science, hypothesis, natural, law, and, supernatural, ideas, allows, sociology, to, be, divided, into, these, two, categories, by, combining, the, simple, facts, from, the, abstract, to, the, supernatural, and, switching, our, thinking, towards, hypothetical, observation, the, sciences, culminate, in, order, to, formulate, sociology, and, this, new, societal, division, every, social, system, aims, definitively, at, directing, all, special, forces, towards, a, general, result, for, the, exercise, of, a, general, and, combined, activity, is, the, essence, of, the, society, social, phenomena, comte, believed, can, be, transferred, into, laws, and, that, systemization, could, become, the, prime, guide, to, sociology, so, that, all, can, maintain, knowledge, to, continue, building, a, strong, intellectual, society, to, continue, building, a, strong, intellectual, society, comte, believed, the, building, or, reformation, requires, intricate, steps, to, achieve, success, first, the, new, society, must, be, created, after, the, old, society, is, destroyed, because, without, destruction, no, adequate, conception, could, be, formed, of, what, must, be, done, essentially, a, new, society, cannot, be, formed, if, it, is, constantly, hindered, by, the, ghost, of, its, past, on, the, same, terms, there, will, be, no, room, for, progress, if, the, new, society, continues, to, compare, itself, to, the, old, society, if, humanity, does, not, destroy, the, old, society, the, old, society, will, destroy, humanity, or, on, the, other, hand, if, one, destroys, the, old, society, without, ever, replacing, it, the, people, march, onwards, towards, total, anarchy, if, the, society, is, continuously, chipped, away, without, being, replaced, with, new, ideal, societal, structures, then, society, will, fall, deeper, back, into, its, old, faults, the, burdens, will, grow, deep, and, entangle, the, platforms, for, the, new, society, thus, prohibiting, progress, and, ultimately, fulfilling, the, cursed, seesaw, of, remodeling, and, destroying, society, hence, according, to, comte, to, design, a, successful, new, society, one, must, keep, the, balance, of, reconstruction, and, deconstruction, this, balance, allows, for, progress, to, continue, without, fault, auguste, comte, is, well, known, for, writing, in, his, book, the, positive, philosophy, that, people, would, never, learn, the, chemical, composition, of, the, stars, this, has, been, called, a, very, poor, prediction, regarding, human, limits, in, science, in, thirty, years, people, were, beginning, to, learn, the, composition, of, stars, through, spectroscopy, beyond, comte, s, substantive, theoretical, corpus, a, less, well, known, yet, interesting, aspect, of, his, work, is, his, reflections, upon, the, relation, between, self, and, knowledge, production, comte, was, troubled, by, the, problem, of, how, an, individual, that, is, the, product, of, actually, existing, society, could, produce, science, aimed, at, transforming, said, society, and, speaks, in, positive, polity, of, a, process, of, self, transformation, aimed, at, improving, himself, as, a, knowledge, producer, as, the, methodologist, audrey, alejandro, has, elaborated, these, considerations, by, comte, foreshadow, key, concerns, in, contemporary, social, science, regarding, the, importance, of, reflexivity, meaning, by, this, the, necessity, to, be, critically, aware, and, to, assess, the, ways, personal, dispositions, and, unconscious, discourses, shape, the, production, of, knowledge, moving, forward, alejandro, has, seen, in, comte, a, foundation, to, develop, a, reflexive, discourse, analysis, rda, framework, so, as, to, provide, social, scientists, with, applicable, tools, from, discourse, analysis, for, the, task, of, implementing, reflexivity, in, practice
