ambrose, of, milan, latin, aurelius, ambrosius, c, 339, 4, april, 397, venerated, as, saint, ambrose, was, a, theologian, and, statesman, who, served, as, bishop, of, milan, from, 374, to, 397, he, expressed, himself, prominently, as, a, public, figure, fiercely, promoting, roman, christianity, against, arianism, and, paganism, he, left, a, substantial, collection, of, writings, of, which, the, best, known, include, the, ethical, commentary, de, officiis, ministrorum, 377, 391, and, the, exegetical, exameron, 386, 390, his, preachings, his, actions, and, his, literary, works, in, addition, to, his, innovative, musical, hymnography, made, him, one, of, the, most, influential, ecclesiastical, figures, of, the, 4th, century, ambrose, was, serving, as, the, roman, governor, of, aemilia, liguria, in, milan, when, he, was, unexpectedly, made, bishop, of, milan, in, 374, by, popular, acclamation, as, bishop, he, took, a, firm, position, against, arianism, and, attempted, to, mediate, the, conflict, between, the, emperors, theodosius, i, and, magnus, maximus, tradition, credits, ambrose, with, developing, an, antiphonal, chant, known, as, ambrosian, chant, and, for, composing, the, te, deum, hymn, though, modern, scholars, now, reject, both, of, these, attributions, ambrose, s, authorship, on, at, least, four, hymns, including, the, well, known, veni, redemptor, gentium, is, secure, they, form, the, core, of, the, ambrosian, hymns, which, includes, others, that, are, sometimes, attributed, to, him, he, also, had, a, notable, influence, on, augustine, of, hippo, 354, 430, whom, he, helped, convert, to, christianity, western, christianity, identified, ambrose, as, one, of, its, four, traditional, doctors, of, the, church, he, is, considered, a, saint, by, the, catholic, church, eastern, orthodox, church, anglican, communion, and, various, lutheran, denominations, and, venerated, as, the, patron, saint, of, milan, and, beekeepers, legends, about, ambrose, had, spread, through, the, empire, long, before, his, biography, was, written, making, it, difficult, for, modern, historians, to, understand, his, true, character, and, fairly, place, his, behaviour, within, the, context, of, antiquity, most, agree, he, was, the, personification, of, his, era, this, would, make, ambrose, a, genuinely, spiritual, man, who, spoke, up, and, defended, his, faith, against, opponents, an, aristocrat, who, retained, many, of, the, attitudes, and, practices, of, a, roman, governor, and, also, an, ascetic, who, served, the, poor, ambrose, was, born, into, a, roman, christian, family, in, the, year, 339, ambrose, himself, wrote, that, he, was, 53, years, old, in, his, letter, number, 49, which, has, been, dated, to, 392, he, began, life, in, augusta, treverorum, modern, trier, the, capital, of, the, roman, province, of, gallia, belgica, in, what, was, then, northeastern, gaul, and, is, now, in, the, rhineland, palatinate, in, germany, scholars, disagree, on, who, exactly, his, father, was, his, father, is, sometimes, identified, with, aurelius, ambrosius, a, praetorian, prefect, of, gaul, but, some, scholars, identify, his, father, as, an, official, named, uranius, who, received, an, imperial, constitution, dated, 3, february, 339, addressed, in, a, brief, extract, from, one, of, the, three, emperors, ruling, in, 339, constantine, ii, constantius, ii, or, constans, in, the, codex, theodosianus, book, xi, 5, what, does, seem, certain, is, that, ambrose, was, born, in, trier, and, his, father, was, either, the, praetorian, prefect, or, part, of, his, administration, a, legend, about, ambrose, as, an, infant, recounts, that, a, swarm, of, bees, settled, on, his, face, while, he, lay, in, his, cradle, leaving, behind, a, drop, of, honey, his, father, is, said, to, have, considered, this, a, sign, of, his, future, eloquence, and, honeyed, tongue, bees, and, beehives, often, appear, in, the, saint, s, symbology, ambrose, s, mother, was, a, woman, of, intellect, and, piety, it, was, probable, that, she, was, a, member, of, the, roman, family, aurelii, symmachi, which, would, make, ambrose, a, cousin, of, the, orator, quintus, aurelius, symmachus, the, family, had, produced, one, martyr, the, virgin, soteris, in, its, history, ambrose, was, the, youngest, of, three, children, his, siblings, were, satyrus, the, subject, of, ambrose, s, de, excessu, fratris, satyri, and, marcellina, who, made, a, profession, of, virginity, sometime, between, 352, and, 355, pope, liberius, himself, conferred, the, veil, upon, her, both, ambrose, s, siblings, also, became, venerated, as, saints, sometime, early, in, the, life, of, ambrose, his, father, died, at, an, unknown, later, date, his, mother, fled, trier, with, her, three, children, and, the, family, moved, to, rome, there, ambrose, studied, literature, law, and, rhetoric, he, then, followed, in, his, father, s, footsteps, and, entered, public, service, praetorian, prefect, sextus, claudius, petronius, probus, first, gave, him, a, place, as, a, judicial, councillor, and, then, in, about, 372, made, him, governor, of, the, province, of, liguria, and, emilia, with, headquarters, in, milan, in, 374, the, bishop, of, milan, auxentius, an, arian, died, and, the, arians, challenged, the, succession, ambrose, went, to, the, church, where, the, election, was, to, take, place, to, prevent, an, uproar, which, seemed, probable, in, this, crisis, his, address, was, interrupted, by, a, call, ambrose, bishop, which, was, taken, up, by, the, whole, assembly, ambrose, though, known, to, be, nicene, christian, in, belief, was, considered, acceptable, to, arians, due, to, the, charity, he, had, shown, concerning, their, beliefs, at, first, he, energetically, refused, the, office, of, bishop, for, which, he, felt, he, was, in, no, way, prepared, ambrose, was, a, relatively, new, christian, who, was, not, yet, baptized, nor, formally, trained, in, theology, ambrose, fled, to, a, colleague, s, home, seeking, to, hide, upon, receiving, a, letter, from, the, emperor, gratian, praising, the, appropriateness, of, rome, appointing, individuals, worthy, of, holy, positions, ambrose, s, host, gave, him, up, within, a, week, he, was, baptized, ordained, and, duly, consecrated, as, the, new, bishop, of, milan, this, was, the, first, time, in, the, west, that, a, member, of, the, upper, class, of, high, officials, had, accepted, the, office, of, bishop, as, bishop, he, immediately, adopted, an, ascetic, lifestyle, apportioned, his, money, to, the, poor, donating, all, of, his, land, making, only, provision, for, his, sister, marcellina, this, raised, his, standing, even, further, it, was, his, popularity, with, the, people, that, gave, him, considerable, political, leverage, throughout, his, career, upon, the, unexpected, appointment, of, ambrose, to, the, episcopate, his, brother, satyrus, resigned, a, prefecture, in, order, to, move, to, milan, where, he, took, over, managing, the, diocese, s, temporal, affairs, arius, died, 336, was, a, christian, priest, who, around, the, year, 300, asserted, that, god, the, father, must, have, created, the, son, indicating, that, the, son, was, a, lesser, being, who, was, not, eternal, and, of, a, different, essence, than, god, the, father, this, christology, though, contrary, to, tradition, quickly, spread, through, egypt, libya, and, other, roman, provinces, bishops, engaged, in, the, dispute, and, the, people, divided, into, parties, sometimes, demonstrating, in, the, streets, in, support, of, one, side, or, the, other, arianism, appealed, to, many, high, level, leaders, and, clergy, in, both, the, western, and, eastern, empires, although, the, western, emperor, gratian, r, 367, 383, supported, orthodoxy, his, younger, half, brother, valentinian, ii, who, became, his, colleague, in, the, empire, in, 375, adhered, to, the, arian, creed, ambrose, sought, to, refute, arian, propositions, theologically, but, ambrose, did, not, sway, the, young, prince, s, position, in, the, east, emperor, theodosius, i, r, 379, 395, likewise, professed, the, nicene, creed, but, there, were, many, adherents, of, arianism, throughout, his, dominions, especially, among, the, higher, clergy, in, this, state, of, religious, ferment, two, leaders, of, the, arians, bishops, palladius, of, ratiaria, and, secundianus, of, singidunum, confident, of, numbers, prevailed, upon, gratian, to, call, a, general, council, from, all, parts, of, the, empire, this, request, appeared, so, equitable, that, gratian, complied, without, hesitation, however, ambrose, feared, the, consequences, and, prevailed, upon, the, emperor, to, have, the, matter, determined, by, a, council, of, the, western, bishops, accordingly, a, synod, composed, of, thirty, two, bishops, was, held, at, aquileia, in, the, year, 381, ambrose, was, elected, president, and, palladius, being, called, upon, to, defend, his, opinions, declined, a, vote, was, then, taken, and, palladius, and, his, associate, secundianus, were, deposed, from, their, episcopal, offices, ambrose, struggled, with, arianism, for, over, half, of, his, term, in, the, episcopate, ecclesiastical, unity, was, important, to, the, church, but, it, was, no, less, important, to, the, state, and, as, a, roman, ambrose, felt, strongly, about, that, conflict, over, heresies, loomed, large, in, an, age, of, religious, ferment, comparable, to, the, reformation, of, the, fourteenth, and, fifteenth, centuries, orthodox, christianity, was, determining, how, to, define, itself, as, it, faced, multiple, challenges, on, both, a, theological, and, a, practical, level, and, ambrose, exercised, crucial, influence, at, a, crucial, time, ambrose, had, good, relations, and, varying, levels, of, influence, with, the, roman, emperors, gratian, valentinian, ii, and, theodosius, i, but, exactly, how, much, influence, what, kind, of, influence, and, in, what, ways, when, has, been, debated, in, the, scholarship, of, the, late, twentieth, and, early, twenty, first, centuries, it, has, long, been, convention, to, see, gratian, and, ambrose, as, having, a, personal, friendship, putting, ambrose, in, the, dominant, role, of, spiritual, guide, but, modern, scholars, now, find, this, view, hard, to, support, from, the, sources, the, ancient, christian, historian, sozomen, c, 400, c, 450, is, the, only, ancient, source, that, shows, ambrose, and, gratian, together, in, any, personal, interaction, in, that, interaction, sozomen, relates, that, in, the, last, year, of, gratian, s, reign, ambrose, intruded, on, gratian, s, private, hunting, party, in, order, to, appeal, on, behalf, of, a, pagan, senator, sentenced, to, die, after, years, of, acquaintance, this, indicates, that, ambrose, could, not, take, for, granted, that, gratian, would, see, him, so, instead, ambrose, had, to, resort, to, such, manoeuvrings, to, make, his, appeal, gratian, was, personally, devout, long, before, meeting, ambrose, modern, scholarship, indicates, gratian, s, religious, policies, do, not, evidence, capitulation, to, ambrose, more, than, they, evidence, gratian, s, own, views, gratian, s, devotion, did, lead, ambrose, to, write, a, large, number, of, books, and, letters, of, theology, and, spiritual, commentary, dedicated, to, the, emperor, the, sheer, volume, of, these, writings, and, the, effusive, praise, they, contain, has, led, many, historians, to, conclude, that, gratian, was, dominated, by, ambrose, and, it, was, that, dominance, that, produced, gratian, s, anti, pagan, actions, mclynn, asserts, that, effusive, praises, were, common, in, everyone, s, correspondence, with, the, crown, he, adds, that, gratian, s, actions, were, determined, by, the, constraints, of, the, system, as, much, as, by, his, own, initiatives, or, ambrose, s, influence, mclynn, asserts, that, the, largest, influence, on, gratian, s, policy, was, the, profound, change, in, political, circumstances, produced, by, the, battle, of, adrianople, in, 378, gratian, had, become, involved, in, fighting, the, goths, the, previous, year, and, had, been, on, his, way, to, the, balkans, when, his, uncle, and, the, cream, of, the, eastern, army, were, destroyed, at, adrianople, gratian, withdrew, to, sirmium, and, set, up, his, court, there, several, rival, groups, including, the, arians, sought, to, secure, benefits, from, the, government, at, sirmium, in, an, arian, attempt, to, undermine, ambrose, whom, gratian, had, not, yet, met, gratian, was, warned, that, ambrose, s, faith, was, suspect, gratian, took, steps, to, investigate, by, writing, to, ambrose, and, asking, him, to, explain, his, faith, ambrose, and, gratian, first, met, after, this, in, 379, during, a, visit, to, milan, the, bishop, made, a, good, impression, on, gratian, and, his, court, which, was, pervasively, christian, and, aristocratic, much, like, ambrose, himself, the, emperor, returned, to, milan, in, 380, to, find, that, ambrose, had, complied, with, his, request, for, a, statement, of, his, faith, in, two, volumes, known, as, de, fide, a, statement, of, orthodoxy, and, of, ambrose, political, theology, as, well, as, a, polemic, against, the, arian, heresy, intended, for, public, discussion, the, emperor, had, not, asked, to, be, instructed, by, ambrose, and, in, de, fide, ambrose, states, this, clearly, nor, was, he, asked, to, refute, the, arians, he, was, asked, to, justify, his, own, position, but, in, the, end, he, did, all, three, it, seems, that, by, 382, ambrose, had, replaced, ausonius, to, become, a, major, influence, in, gratian, s, court, ambrose, had, not, yet, become, the, conscience, of, kings, he, would, in, the, later, 380s, but, he, did, speak, out, against, reinstating, the, altar, of, victory, in, 382, gratian, was, the, first, to, divert, public, financial, subsidies, that, had, previously, supported, rome, s, cults, before, that, year, contributions, in, support, of, the, ancient, customs, had, continued, unchallenged, by, the, state, the, childless, gratian, had, treated, his, younger, brother, valentinian, ii, like, a, son, ambrose, on, the, other, hand, had, incurred, the, lasting, enmity, of, valentinian, ii, s, mother, the, empress, justina, in, the, winter, of, 379, by, helping, to, appoint, a, nicene, bishop, in, sirmium, not, long, after, this, valentinian, ii, his, mother, and, the, court, left, sirmium, sirmium, had, come, under, theodosius, control, so, they, went, to, milan, which, was, ruled, by, gratian, in, 383, gratian, was, assassinated, at, lyon, in, gaul, france, by, magnus, maximus, valentinian, was, twelve, years, old, and, the, assassination, left, his, mother, justina, in, a, position, of, something, akin, to, a, regent, in, 385, or, 386, the, emperor, valentinian, ii, and, his, mother, justina, along, with, a, considerable, number, of, clergy, the, laity, and, the, military, professed, arianism, conflict, between, ambrose, and, justina, soon, followed, the, arians, demanded, that, valentinian, allocate, to, them, two, churches, in, milan, one, in, the, city, the, basilica, of, the, apostles, the, other, in, the, suburbs, st, victor, s, ambrose, refused, to, surrender, the, churches, he, answered, by, saying, that, what, belongs, to, god, is, outside, the, emperor, s, power, in, this, ambrose, called, on, an, ancient, roman, principle, a, temple, set, apart, to, a, god, became, the, property, of, that, god, ambrose, now, applied, this, ancient, legal, principle, to, the, christian, churches, seeing, the, bishop, as, a, divine, representative, as, guardian, of, his, god, s, property, subsequently, while, ambrose, was, performing, the, liturgy, of, the, hours, in, the, basilica, the, prefect, of, the, city, came, to, persuade, him, to, give, it, up, to, the, arians, ambrose, again, refused, certain, deans, officers, of, the, court, were, sent, to, take, possession, of, the, basilica, by, hanging, upon, it, imperial, escutcheons, instead, soldiers, from, the, ranks, the, emperor, had, placed, around, the, basilica, began, pouring, into, the, church, assuring, ambrose, of, their, fidelity, the, escutcheons, outside, the, church, were, removed, and, legend, says, the, children, tore, them, to, shreds, ambrose, refused, to, surrender, the, basilica, and, sent, sharp, answers, back, to, his, emperor, if, you, demand, my, person, i, am, ready, to, submit, carry, me, to, prison, or, to, death, i, will, not, resist, but, i, will, never, betray, the, church, of, christ, i, will, not, call, upon, the, people, to, succour, me, i, will, die, at, the, foot, of, the, altar, rather, than, desert, it, the, tumult, of, the, people, i, will, not, encourage, but, god, alone, can, appease, it, by, thursday, the, emperor, gave, in, bitterly, responding, soon, if, ambrose, gives, the, orders, you, will, be, sending, me, to, him, in, chains, in, 386, justina, and, valentinian, ii, received, the, arian, bishop, auxentius, the, younger, and, ambrose, was, again, ordered, to, hand, over, a, church, in, milan, for, arian, usage, ambrose, and, his, congregation, barricaded, themselves, inside, the, church, and, again, the, imperial, order, was, rescinded, there, was, an, attempted, kidnapping, and, another, attempt, to, arrest, him, and, to, force, him, to, leave, the, city, several, accusations, were, made, but, unlike, in, the, case, of, john, chrysostom, no, formal, charges, were, brought, the, emperor, certainly, had, the, power, to, do, so, and, probably, did, not, solely, because, of, ambrose, s, popularity, with, the, people, and, what, they, might, do, when, magnus, maximus, usurped, power, in, gaul, 383, and, was, considering, a, descent, upon, italy, valentinian, sent, ambrose, to, dissuade, him, and, the, embassy, was, successful, 384, a, second, later, embassy, was, unsuccessful, magnus, maximus, entered, italy, 386, 387, and, milan, was, taken, justina, and, her, son, fled, but, ambrose, remained, and, had, the, plate, of, the, church, melted, for, the, relief, of, the, poor, after, defeating, the, usurper, maximus, at, aquileia, in, 388, theodosius, handed, the, western, realm, back, to, the, young, valentinian, ii, the, seventeen, year, old, son, of, the, forceful, and, hardy, pannonian, general, valentinian, i, and, his, wife, the, arian, justina, furthermore, the, eastern, emperor, remained, in, italy, for, a, considerable, period, to, supervise, affairs, returning, to, constantinople, in, 391, and, leaving, behind, the, frankish, general, arbogast, to, keep, an, eye, on, the, young, emperor, by, may, of, the, following, year, arbogast, s, ward, was, dead, amidst, rumours, of, both, treachery, and, suicide, while, ambrose, was, writing, de, fide, theodosius, published, his, own, statement, of, faith, in, 381, in, an, edict, establishing, nicene, catholic, christianity, as, the, only, legitimate, version, of, the, christian, faith, there, is, unanimity, amongst, scholars, that, this, represents, the, emperor, s, own, beliefs, the, aftermath, of, the, death, 378, of, valens, emperor, in, the, east, from, 364, to, 378, had, left, many, questions, for, the, church, unresolved, and, theodosius, edict, can, be, seen, as, an, effort, to, begin, addressing, those, questions, theodosius, natural, generosity, was, tempered, by, his, pressing, need, to, establish, himself, and, to, publicly, assert, his, personal, piety, on, 28, february, 380, theodosius, issued, the, edict, of, thessalonica, a, decree, addressed, to, the, city, of, constantinople, determining, that, only, christians, who, did, not, support, arian, views, were, catholic, and, could, have, their, places, of, worship, officially, recognized, as, churches, the, edict, opposed, arianism, and, attempted, to, establish, unity, in, christianity, and, to, suppress, heresy, german, ancient, historian, karl, leo, noethlichs, writes, that, the, edict, of, thessalonica, was, neither, anti, pagan, nor, antisemitic, it, did, not, declare, christianity, to, be, the, official, religion, of, the, empire, and, it, gave, no, advantage, to, christians, over, other, faiths, liebeschuetz, and, hill, indicate, that, it, was, not, until, after, 388, during, theodosius, stay, in, milan, following, the, defeat, of, maximus, in, 388, that, theodosius, and, ambrose, first, met, after, the, massacre, of, thessalonica, in, 390, theodosius, made, an, act, of, public, penance, at, ambrose, s, behest, ambrose, was, away, from, court, during, the, events, at, thessalonica, but, after, being, informed, of, them, he, wrote, theodosius, a, letter, in, that, still, existing, letter, ambrose, presses, for, a, semi, public, demonstration, of, penitence, from, the, emperor, telling, him, that, as, his, bishop, he, will, not, give, theodosius, communion, until, it, is, done, wolf, liebeschuetz, says, theodosius, duly, complied, and, came, to, church, without, his, imperial, robes, until, christmas, when, ambrose, openly, admitted, him, to, communion, formerly, some, scholars, credited, ambrose, with, having, an, undue, influence, over, emperor, theodosius, i, from, this, period, forward, prompting, him, toward, major, anti, pagan, legislation, beginning, in, february, of, 391, however, this, interpretation, has, been, heavily, disputed, since, the, late, twentieth, century, mclynn, argues, that, theodosius, s, anti, pagan, legislation, was, too, limited, in, scope, for, it, to, be, of, interest, to, the, bishop, the, fabled, encounter, at, the, door, of, the, cathedral, in, milan, with, ambrose, as, the, mitred, prelate, braced, blocking, theodosius, from, entering, which, has, sometimes, been, seen, as, evidence, of, ambrose, dominance, over, theodosius, has, been, debunked, by, modern, historians, as, a, pious, fiction, there, was, no, encounter, at, the, church, door, the, story, is, a, product, of, the, imagination, of, theodoret, a, historian, of, the, fifth, century, who, wrote, of, the, events, of, 390, using, his, own, ideology, to, fill, the, gaps, in, the, historical, record, the, twenty, first, century, view, is, that, ambrose, was, not, a, power, behind, the, throne, the, two, men, did, not, meet, each, other, frequently, and, documents, that, reveal, the, relationship, between, the, two, are, less, about, personal, friendship, than, they, are, about, negotiations, between, two, formidable, leaders, of, the, powerful, institutions, they, represent, the, roman, state, and, the, italian, church, cameron, says, there, is, no, evidence, that, ambrose, was, a, significant, influence, on, the, emperor, for, centuries, after, his, death, theodosius, was, regarded, as, a, champion, of, christian, orthodoxy, who, decisively, stamped, out, paganism, this, view, was, recorded, by, theodoret, who, is, recognized, as, an, unreliable, historian, in, the, century, following, their, deaths, theodosius, s, predecessors, constantine, r, 306, 337, constantius, r, 337, 361, and, valens, had, all, been, semi, arians, therefore, it, fell, to, the, orthodox, theodosius, to, receive, from, christian, literary, tradition, most, of, the, credit, for, the, final, triumph, of, christianity, modern, scholars, see, this, as, an, interpretation, of, history, by, orthodox, christian, writers, more, than, as, a, representation, of, actual, history, the, view, of, a, pious, theodosius, submitting, meekly, to, the, authority, of, the, church, represented, by, ambrose, is, part, of, the, myth, that, evolved, within, a, generation, of, their, deaths, in, april, 393, arbogast, magister, militum, of, the, west, and, his, puppet, emperor, eugenius, marched, into, italy, to, consolidate, their, position, against, theodosius, i, and, his, son, honorius, now, appointed, augustus, to, govern, the, western, portion, of, the, empire, arbogast, and, eugenius, courted, ambrose, s, support, by, very, obliging, letters, but, before, they, arrived, at, milan, he, had, retired, to, bologna, where, he, assisted, at, the, translation, of, the, relics, of, saints, vitalis, and, agricola, from, there, he, went, to, florence, where, he, remained, until, eugenius, withdrew, from, milan, to, meet, theodosius, in, the, battle, of, the, frigidus, in, early, september, 394, soon, after, acquiring, the, undisputed, possession, of, the, roman, empire, theodosius, died, at, milan, in, 395, and, ambrose, gave, the, eulogy, two, years, later, 4, april, 397, ambrose, also, died, he, was, succeeded, as, bishop, of, milan, by, simplician, ambrose, s, body, may, still, be, viewed, in, the, church, of, saint, ambrogio, in, milan, where, it, has, been, continuously, venerated, along, with, the, bodies, identified, in, his, time, as, being, those, of, saints, gervase, and, protase, ambrose, is, remembered, in, the, calendar, of, the, roman, rite, of, the, catholic, church, on, 7, december, and, is, also, honoured, in, the, church, of, england, and, in, the, episcopal, church, on, 7, december, in, 1960, neil, b, mclynn, wrote, a, complex, study, of, ambrose, that, focused, on, his, politics, and, was, intended, to, demonstrate, that, ambrose, viewed, community, as, a, means, to, acquire, personal, political, power, subsequent, studies, of, how, ambrose, handled, his, episcopal, responsibilities, his, nicene, theology, and, his, dealings, with, the, arians, in, his, episcopate, his, pastoral, care, his, commitment, to, community, and, his, personal, asceticism, have, mitigated, this, view, all, of, ambrose, s, writings, are, works, of, advocacy, for, his, religion, and, even, his, political, views, and, actions, were, closely, related, to, his, religion, he, was, rarely, if, ever, concerned, about, simply, recording, what, had, happened, he, did, not, write, to, reveal, his, inner, thoughts, and, struggles, he, wrote, to, advocate, for, his, god, boniface, ramsey, writes, that, it, is, difficult, not, to, posit, a, deep, spirituality, in, a, man, who, wrote, on, the, mystical, meanings, of, the, song, of, songs, and, wrote, many, extraordinary, hymns, despite, an, abiding, spirituality, ambrose, had, a, generally, straightforward, manner, and, a, practical, rather, than, a, speculative, tendency, in, his, thinking, de, officiis, is, a, utilitarian, guide, for, his, clergy, in, their, daily, ministry, in, the, milanese, church, rather, than, an, intellectual, tour, de, force, christian, faith, in, the, third, century, developed, the, monastic, lifestyle, which, subsequently, spread, into, the, rest, of, roman, society, in, a, general, practice, of, virginity, voluntary, poverty, and, self, denial, for, religious, reasons, this, lifestyle, was, embraced, by, many, new, converts, including, ambrose, even, though, they, did, not, become, actual, monks, the, bishops, of, this, era, had, heavy, administrative, responsibilities, and, ambrose, was, also, sometimes, occupied, with, imperial, affairs, but, he, still, fulfilled, his, primary, responsibility, to, care, for, the, well, being, of, his, flock, he, preached, and, celebrated, the, eucharist, multiple, times, a, week, sometimes, daily, and, dealt, directly, with, the, needs, of, the, poor, as, well, as, widows, and, orphans, virgins, nuns, and, his, own, clergy, he, replied, to, letters, personally, practised, hospitality, and, made, himself, available, to, the, people, ambrose, had, the, ability, to, maintain, good, relationships, with, all, kinds, of, people, local, church, practices, varied, quite, a, bit, from, place, to, place, at, this, time, and, as, the, bishop, ambrose, could, have, required, that, everyone, adapt, to, his, way, of, doing, things, it, was, his, place, to, keep, the, churches, as, united, as, possible, in, both, ritual, and, belief, instead, he, respected, local, customs, adapting, himself, to, whatever, practices, prevailed, instructing, his, mother, to, do, the, same, as, bishop, ambrose, undertook, many, different, labours, in, an, effort, to, unite, people, and, provide, some, stability, during, a, period, of, religious, political, military, and, social, upheavals, and, transformations, brown, says, ambrose, had, the, makings, of, a, faction, fighter, while, he, got, along, well, with, most, people, ambrose, was, not, averse, to, conflict, and, even, opposed, emperors, with, a, fearlessness, born, of, self, confidence, and, a, clear, conscience, and, not, from, any, belief, he, would, not, suffer, for, his, decisions, having, begun, his, life, as, a, roman, aristocrat, and, a, governor, it, is, clear, that, ambrose, retained, the, attitudes, and, practices, of, roman, governance, even, after, becoming, a, bishop, his, acts, and, writings, show, he, was, quite, clear, about, the, limits, of, imperial, power, over, the, church, s, internal, affairs, including, doctrine, moral, teaching, and, governance, he, wrote, to, valentinian, in, matters, of, faith, bishops, are, the, judges, of, christian, emperors, not, emperors, of, bishops, epistle, 21, 4, he, also, famously, said, to, an, arian, bishop, chosen, by, the, emperor, the, emperor, is, in, the, church, not, over, the, church, sermon, against, auxentius, 36, ambrose, s, acts, and, writings, created, a, sort, of, model, which, was, to, remain, valid, in, the, latin, west, for, the, relations, of, the, church, and, the, christian, state, both, powers, stood, in, a, basically, positive, relationship, to, each, other, but, the, innermost, sphere, of, the, church, s, life, faith, the, moral, order, ecclesiastical, discipline, remained, withdrawn, from, the, state, s, influence, ambrose, was, also, well, aware, of, the, limits, of, his, power, at, the, height, of, his, career, as, a, venerable, respected, and, well, loved, bishop, in, 396, imperial, agents, marched, into, his, church, pushing, past, him, and, his, clergy, who, had, crowded, the, altar, to, protect, a, political, suspect, from, arrest, and, dragged, the, man, from, the, church, in, front, of, ambrose, who, could, do, nothing, to, stop, them, when, it, came, to, the, central, functions, of, the, roman, state, even, the, vivid, ambrose, was, a, lightweight, ambrose, is, recorded, on, occasions, as, taking, a, hostile, attitude, towards, jews, for, example, in, 388, when, the, emperor, theodosius, i, was, informed, that, a, crowd, of, christians, had, retaliated, against, the, local, jewish, community, by, destroying, the, synagogue, at, callinicum, on, the, euphrates, the, synagogue, most, probably, existed, within, the, fortified, town, to, serve, the, soldiers, stationed, there, and, theodosius, ordered, that, the, offenders, be, punished, and, that, the, synagogue, be, rebuilt, at, the, expense, of, the, bishop, ambrose, wrote, to, the, emperor, arguing, against, this, basing, his, argument, on, two, assertions, first, if, the, bishop, obeyed, the, order, it, would, be, a, betrayal, of, his, faith, and, second, if, the, bishop, instead, refused, to, obey, the, order, he, would, become, a, martyr, and, create, a, scandal, embarrassing, the, emperor, ambrose, referring, to, a, prior, incident, where, magnus, maximus, issued, an, edict, censuring, christians, in, rome, for, burning, down, a, jewish, synagogue, warned, theodosius, that, the, people, in, turn, exclaimed, the, emperor, has, become, a, jew, implying, that, theodosius, would, receive, the, same, lack, of, support, from, the, people, theodosius, rescinded, the, order, concerning, the, bishop, that, was, not, enough, for, ambrose, however, and, when, theodosius, next, visited, milan, ambrose, confronted, him, directly, in, an, effort, to, get, him, to, drop, the, entire, case, mclynn, argues, that, ambrose, failed, to, win, the, emperor, s, sympathy, and, was, mostly, excluded, from, his, counsels, thereafter, the, callinicum, affair, was, not, an, isolated, incident, generally, speaking, however, while, mclynn, says, it, makes, ambrose, look, like, a, bully, and, a, bigot, to, modern, eyes, scholars, also, agree, that, ambrose, s, attitudes, toward, the, jews, cannot, be, fairly, summarized, in, one, sentence, as, not, all, of, ambrose, s, attitudes, toward, jews, were, negative, for, example, ambrose, makes, extensive, and, appreciative, use, of, the, works, of, a, jew, philo, of, alexandria, in, his, own, writings, treating, philo, as, one, of, the, faithful, interpreters, of, the, scriptures, philo, was, an, educated, man, of, some, standing, and, a, prolific, writer, during, the, era, of, second, temple, judaism, forty, three, of, his, treatises, have, been, preserved, and, these, by, christians, rather, than, jews, philo, became, foundational, in, forming, the, christian, literary, view, on, the, six, days, of, creation, through, basil, s, hexaemeron, eusebius, the, cappadocian, fathers, and, didymus, the, blind, appropriated, material, from, philo, as, well, but, none, did, so, more, than, ambrose, as, a, result, of, these, extensive, references, philo, was, accepted, into, the, christian, tradition, as, an, honorary, church, father, in, fact, one, byzantine, catena, even, refers, to, him, as, bishop, philo, this, high, regard, for, philo, even, led, to, a, number, of, legends, of, his, conversion, to, christianity, although, this, assertion, stands, on, very, dubious, evidence, ambrose, also, used, josephus, maccabees, and, other, jewish, sources, for, his, writings, he, praises, some, individual, jews, ambrose, tended, to, write, negatively, of, all, non, nicenes, as, if, they, were, all, in, one, category, this, served, a, rhetorical, purpose, in, his, writing, and, should, be, considered, accordingly, modern, scholarship, indicates, that, paganism, was, a, lesser, concern, than, heresy, for, christians, in, the, fourth, and, fifth, centuries, including, ambrose, but, it, was, still, a, concern, writings, of, this, period, were, commonly, hostile, and, often, contemptuous, toward, paganism, which, christianity, saw, as, already, defeated, in, heaven, the, great, christian, writers, of, the, third, to, fifth, centuries, attempted, to, discredit, the, continuation, of, these, defeated, practices, by, searching, pagan, writings, particularly, those, of, varro, for, everything, that, could, be, regarded, by, christian, standards, as, repulsive, and, irreligious, ambrose, work, reflects, this, triumphalism, throughout, his, time, in, the, episcopate, ambrose, was, active, in, his, opposition, to, any, state, sponsorship, of, pagan, cults, when, gratian, ordered, the, altar, of, victory, to, be, removed, it, roused, the, aristocracy, of, rome, to, send, a, delegation, to, the, emperor, to, appeal, against, the, decision, but, pope, damasus, i, induced, christian, senators, to, petition, against, it, and, ambrose, blocked, the, delegates, from, obtaining, an, audience, with, the, emperor, under, valentinian, ii, an, effort, was, made, to, restore, the, altar, of, victory, to, its, ancient, station, in, the, hall, of, the, roman, senate, and, to, again, provide, support, for, the, seven, vestal, virgins, the, pagan, party, was, led, by, the, refined, senator, quintus, aurelius, symmachus, who, used, all, his, prodigious, skill, and, artistry, to, create, a, marvellous, document, full, of, the, maiestas, populi, romani, hans, lietzmann, writes, that, pagans, and, christians, alike, were, stirred, by, the, solemn, earnestness, of, an, admonition, which, called, all, men, of, goodwill, to, the, aid, of, a, glorious, history, to, render, all, worthy, honour, to, a, world, that, was, fading, away, then, ambrose, wrote, to, valentinian, asserting, that, the, emperor, was, a, soldier, of, god, not, simply, a, personal, believer, but, one, bound, by, his, position, to, serve, the, faith, under, no, circumstances, could, he, agree, to, something, that, would, promote, the, worship, of, idols, ambrose, held, up, the, example, of, valentinian, s, brother, gratian, reminding, valentinian, that, the, commandment, of, god, must, take, precedence, the, bishop, s, intervention, led, to, the, failure, of, symmachus, appeal, in, 389, ambrose, stepped, in, against, a, pagan, senatorial, delegation, who, wished, to, see, the, emperor, theodosius, i, although, theodosius, refused, their, requests, he, was, irritated, at, the, bishop, s, presumption, and, refused, to, see, him, for, several, days, later, ambrose, wrote, a, letter, to, the, emperor, eugenius, complaining, that, some, gifts, the, latter, had, bestowed, on, pagan, senators, could, be, used, for, funding, pagan, cults, ambrose, joins, augustine, jerome, and, gregory, the, great, as, one, of, the, latin, doctors, of, the, church, theologians, compare, him, with, hilary, who, they, claim, fell, short, of, ambrose, s, administrative, excellence, but, demonstrated, greater, theological, ability, he, succeeded, as, a, theologian, despite, his, juridical, training, and, his, comparatively, late, handling, of, biblical, and, doctrinal, subjects, ambrose, s, intense, episcopal, consciousness, furthered, the, growing, doctrine, of, the, church, and, its, sacerdotal, ministry, while, the, prevalent, asceticism, of, the, day, continuing, the, stoic, and, ciceronian, training, of, his, youth, enabled, him, to, promulgate, a, lofty, standard, of, christian, ethics, thus, we, have, the, de, officiis, ministrorum, de, viduis, de, virginitate, and, de, paenitentia, ambrose, displayed, a, kind, of, liturgical, flexibility, that, kept, in, mind, that, liturgy, was, a, tool, to, serve, people, in, worshiping, god, and, ought, not, to, become, a, rigid, entity, that, is, invariable, from, place, to, place, his, advice, to, augustine, of, hippo, on, this, point, was, to, follow, local, liturgical, custom, when, i, am, at, rome, i, fast, on, a, saturday, when, i, am, at, milan, i, do, not, follow, the, custom, of, the, church, where, you, are, thus, ambrose, refused, to, be, drawn, into, a, false, conflict, over, which, particular, local, church, had, the, right, liturgical, form, where, there, was, no, substantial, problem, his, advice, has, remained, in, the, english, language, as, the, saying, when, in, rome, do, as, the, romans, do, some, scholars, argue, that, ambrose, was, a, christian, universalist, it, has, been, noted, that, ambrose, s, theology, was, significantly, influenced, by, that, of, origen, and, didymus, the, blind, two, other, early, christian, universalists, one, quotation, cited, in, favour, of, this, belief, is, our, savior, has, appointed, two, kinds, of, resurrection, in, the, apocalypse, blessed, is, he, that, hath, part, in, the, first, resurrection, for, such, come, to, grace, without, the, judgment, as, for, those, who, do, not, come, to, the, first, but, are, reserved, unto, the, second, resurrection, these, shall, be, disciplined, until, their, appointed, times, between, the, first, and, the, second, resurrection, one, could, interpret, this, passage, as, being, another, example, of, the, christian, belief, in, a, general, resurrection, that, both, those, in, heaven, and, in, hell, undergo, a, bodily, resurrection, or, an, allusion, to, purgatory, that, some, destined, for, heaven, must, first, undergo, a, phase, of, purification, some, other, works, by, ambrose, could, potentially, be, seen, as, teaching, the, mainstream, view, of, salvation, for, example, the, jews, feared, to, believe, in, manhood, taken, up, into, god, and, therefore, have, lost, the, grace, of, redemption, because, they, reject, that, on, which, salvation, depends, this, could, be, interpreted, as, something, which, is, not, eschatological, but, rather, rhetorical, or, conditional, on, the, state, of, repentance, the, passage, most, often, cited, in, support, of, ambrose, supposed, belief, in, apokatastasis, is, his, commentary, on, 1, corinthians, 15, it, reads, a, unity, of, power, puts, aside, all, idea, of, a, degrading, subjection, his, giving, up, of, power, and, his, victory, as, conqueror, won, over, death, have, not, lessened, his, power, obedience, works, out, subjection, christ, has, taken, obedience, upon, himself, obedience, even, to, taking, on, him, our, flesh, the, cross, even, to, gaining, our, salvation, thus, where, the, work, lies, there, too, is, the, author, of, the, work, when, therefore, all, things, have, become, subject, to, christ, through, christ, s, obedience, so, that, all, bend, their, knees, in, his, name, then, he, himself, will, be, all, in, all, for, now, since, all, do, not, believe, all, do, not, seem, to, be, in, subjection, but, when, all, have, believed, and, done, the, will, of, god, then, christ, will, be, all, and, in, all, and, when, christ, is, all, and, in, all, then, will, god, be, all, and, in, all, for, the, father, abides, ever, in, the, son, how, then, is, he, shown, to, be, weak, who, redeemed, the, weak, other, scholars, interpret, ambrose, s, soteriology, to, be, in, agreement, with, jerome, of, stridon, and, the, anonymous, individuals, whom, augustine, criticized, in, his, treatise, on, faith, and, works, who, argued, that, while, the, unbelievers, would, experience, eternal, judgement, all, christians, who, have, believed, in, jesus, will, be, reunited, to, god, at, some, point, even, if, they, have, sinned, and, fallen, away, in, de, officiis, the, most, influential, of, his, surviving, works, and, one, of, the, most, important, texts, of, patristic, literature, he, reveals, his, views, connecting, justice, and, generosity, by, asserting, these, practices, are, of, mutual, benefit, to, the, participants, ambrose, draws, heavily, on, cicero, and, the, biblical, book, of, genesis, for, this, concept, of, mutual, inter, dependence, in, society, in, the, bishop, s, view, it, is, concern, for, one, another, s, interests, that, binds, society, together, ambrose, asserts, that, avarice, leads, to, a, breakdown, in, this, mutuality, therefore, avarice, leads, to, a, breakdown, in, society, itself, in, the, late, 380s, the, bishop, took, the, lead, in, opposing, the, greed, of, the, elite, landowners, in, milan, by, starting, a, series, of, pointed, sermons, directed, at, his, wealthy, constituents, on, the, need, for, the, rich, to, care, for, the, poor, some, scholars, have, suggested, ambrose, s, endeavours, to, lead, his, people, as, both, a, roman, and, a, christian, caused, him, to, strive, for, what, a, modern, context, would, describe, as, a, type, of, communism, or, socialism, he, was, not, just, interested, in, the, church, but, was, also, interested, in, the, condition, of, contemporary, italian, society, ambrose, considered, the, poor, not, a, distinct, group, of, outsiders, but, a, part, of, a, united, people, to, be, stood, with, in, solidarity, giving, to, the, poor, was, not, to, be, considered, an, act, of, generosity, towards, the, fringes, of, society, but, a, repayment, of, resources, that, god, had, originally, bestowed, on, everyone, equally, and, that, the, rich, had, usurped, he, defines, justice, as, providing, for, the, poor, whom, he, describes, as, our, brothers, and, sisters, because, they, share, our, common, humanity, the, theological, treatises, of, ambrose, of, milan, would, come, to, influence, popes, damasus, siricius, and, leo, xiii, central, to, ambrose, is, the, virginity, of, mary, and, her, role, as, mother, of, god, ambrose, viewed, celibacy, as, superior, to, marriage, and, saw, mary, as, the, model, of, virginity, ambrose, studied, theology, with, simplician, a, presbyter, of, rome, using, his, excellent, knowledge, of, greek, which, was, then, rare, in, the, west, ambrose, studied, the, old, testament, and, greek, authors, like, philo, origen, athanasius, and, basil, of, caesarea, with, whom, he, was, also, exchanging, letters, ambrose, became, a, famous, rhetorician, whom, augustine, came, to, hear, speak, augustine, wrote, in, his, confessions, that, faustus, the, manichean, rhetorician, was, a, more, impressive, speaker, but, the, content, of, ambrose, s, sermons, began, to, affect, augustine, s, faith, augustine, sought, guidance, from, ambrose, and, again, records, in, his, confessions, that, ambrose, was, too, busy, to, answer, his, questions, in, a, passage, of, augustine, s, confessions, in, which, augustine, wonders, why, he, could, not, share, his, burden, with, ambrose, he, comments, ambrose, himself, i, esteemed, a, happy, man, as, the, world, counted, happiness, because, great, personages, held, him, in, honour, only, his, celibacy, appeared, to, me, a, painful, burden, simplician, regularly, met, with, augustine, however, and, augustine, writes, of, simplician, s, fatherly, affection, for, him, it, was, simplician, who, introduced, augustine, to, christian, neoplatonism, it, is, commonly, understood, in, the, christian, tradition, that, ambrose, baptized, augustine, in, this, same, passage, of, augustine, s, confessions, is, an, anecdote, which, bears, on, the, history, of, reading, when, read, his, eyes, scanned, the, page, and, his, heart, sought, out, the, meaning, but, his, voice, was, silent, and, his, tongue, was, still, anyone, could, approach, him, freely, and, guests, were, not, commonly, announced, so, that, often, when, we, came, to, visit, him, we, found, him, reading, like, this, in, silence, for, he, never, read, aloud, this, is, a, celebrated, passage, in, modern, scholarly, discussion, the, practice, of, reading, to, oneself, without, vocalizing, the, text, was, less, common, in, antiquity, than, it, has, since, become, in, a, culture, that, set, a, high, value, on, oratory, and, public, performances, of, all, kinds, in, which, the, production, of, books, was, very, labour, intensive, the, majority, of, the, population, was, illiterate, and, where, those, with, the, leisure, to, enjoy, literary, works, also, had, slaves, to, read, for, them, written, texts, were, more, likely, to, be, seen, as, scripts, for, recitation, than, as, vehicles, of, silent, reflection, however, there, is, also, evidence, that, silent, reading, did, occur, in, antiquity, and, that, it, was, not, generally, regarded, as, unusual, ambrose, s, writings, extend, past, literature, and, into, music, where, he, was, an, important, innovator, in, early, christian, hymnography, his, contributions, include, the, successful, invention, of, christian, latin, hymnody, while, the, hymnologist, guido, maria, dreves, designated, him, to, be, the, father, of, church, hymnody, he, was, not, the, first, to, write, latin, hymns, the, bishop, hilary, of, poitiers, had, done, so, a, few, decades, before, however, the, hymns, of, hilary, are, thought, to, have, been, largely, inaccessible, because, of, their, complexity, and, length, only, fragments, of, hymns, from, hilary, s, liber, hymnorum, exist, making, those, of, ambrose, the, earliest, extant, complete, latin, hymns, the, assembling, of, ambrose, s, surviving, oeuvre, remains, controversial, the, almost, immediate, popularity, of, his, style, quickly, prompted, imitations, some, which, may, even, date, from, his, lifetime, there, are, four, hymns, for, which, ambrose, s, authorship, is, universally, accepted, as, they, are, attributed, to, him, by, augustine, each, of, these, hymns, has, eight, four, line, stanzas, and, is, written, in, strict, iambic, tetrameter, that, is, 4, 2, syllables, each, iamb, being, two, syllables, marked, by, dignified, simplicity, they, served, as, a, fruitful, model, for, later, times, scholars, such, as, the, theologian, brian, p, dunkle, have, argued, for, the, authenticity, of, as, many, as, thirteen, other, hymns, while, the, musicologist, james, mckinnon, contends, that, further, attributions, could, include, perhaps, some, ten, others, ambrose, is, traditionally, credited, but, not, actually, known, to, have, composed, any, of, the, repertory, of, ambrosian, chant, also, known, simply, as, antiphonal, chant, a, method, of, chanting, where, one, side, of, the, choir, alternately, responds, to, the, other, although, ambrosian, chant, was, named, in, his, honour, no, ambrosian, chant, melodies, can, be, attributed, to, ambrose, with, augustine, ambrose, was, traditionally, credited, with, composing, the, hymn, te, deum, since, the, hymnologist, guido, maria, dreves, in, 1893, however, scholars, have, dismissed, this, attribution, source, all, works, are, originally, in, latin, following, each, is, where, it, may, be, found, in, a, standard, compilation, of, ambrose, s, writings, his, first, work, was, probably, de, paradiso, 377, 378, most, have, approximate, dates, and, works, such, as, de, helia, et, ieiunio, 377, 391, expositio, evangelii, secundum, lucam, 377, 389, and, de, officiis, ministrorum, 377, 391, have, been, given, a, wide, variety, of, datings, by, scholars, his, best, known, work, is, probably, de, officiis, ministrorum, 377, 391, while, the, exameron, 386, 390, and, de, obitu, theodosii, 395, are, among, his, most, noted, works, in, matters, of, exegesis, he, is, like, hilary, an, alexandrian, in, dogma, he, follows, basil, of, caesarea, and, other, greek, authors, but, nevertheless, gives, a, distinctly, western, cast, to, the, speculations, of, which, he, treats, this, is, particularly, manifest, in, the, weightier, emphasis, which, he, lays, upon, human, sin, and, divine, grace, and, in, the, place, which, he, assigns, to, faith, in, the, individual, christian, life, there, has, been, debate, on, the, attribution, of, some, writings, for, example, de, mysteriis, is, usually, attributed, to, ambrose, while, the, related, de, sacramentis, is, written, in, a, different, style, with, some, silent, disagreements, so, there, is, less, consensus, over, its, author, this, latter, work, was, occasionally, identified, as, being, by, st, augustine, though, this, is, erroneous, the, history, of, the, editions, of, the, works, of, st, ambrose, is, a, long, one, erasmus, edited, them, in, four, tomes, at, basle, 1527, a, valuable, roman, edition, was, brought,
