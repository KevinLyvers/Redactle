the, emperor, gallus, anonymus, claimed, that, boles, aw, was, gloriously, raised, to, kingship, by, the, emperor, through, these, acts, but, the, emperor, s, acts, in, gniezno, only, symbolised, that, boles, aw, received, royal, prerogatives, including, the, control, of, the, church, in, his, realm, radim, gaudentius, was, installed, as, the, archbishop, of, the, newly, established, roman,

gallia, germania, and, sclavinia, as, doing, homage, to, the, emperor, who, sat, on, his, throne, historian, alexis, p, vlasto, writes, that, sclavinia, referred, to, poland, proving, that, it, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, christian, realms, subjected, to, the, holy, roman, empire, in, accordance, with, otto, iii, s, idea, of, renovatio, imperii, the, renewal, of, the, roman, empire, based, on, a, federal, concept, within, that, framework, poland, along, with, hungary, was, upgraded, to, an, eastern, foederatus, of, the, holy, roman, empire, according, to, historian, jerzy, strzelczyk, coins, struck, for, boles, aw, shortly, after, his, meeting, with, the, emperor, bore, the, inscription, gnezdun, civitas, showing, that, he, regarded, gniezno, as, his, capital, the, name, of, poland, was, also, recorded, on, the, same, coins, referring, to, the, princes, polonie, the, title, princeps, was, almost, exclusively, used, in, italy, around, that, time, suggesting, that, it, also, represented, the, emperor, s, idea, of, the, renewal, of, the, roman, empire, however, otto, s, premature, death, on, 23, january, 1002, put, an, end, to, his, ambitious, plans, the, contemporaneous, bruno, of, querfurt, stated, that, nobody, lamented, the, 22, year, old, emperor, s, death, with, greater, grief, than, boles, aw, in, 1000, boles, aw, issued, a, law, prohibiting, hunting, beavers, and, created, a, office, called, bobrowniczy, whose, task, was, to, enforce, prince, s, ordinances, three, candidates, were, competing, with, each, other, for, the, german, crown, after, otto, iii, s, death, one, of, them, duke, henry, iv, of, bavaria, promised, the, margraviate, of, meissen, to, boles, aw, in, exchange, for, his, assistance, against, eckard, i, margrave, of, meissen, who, was, the, most, powerful, contender, however, eckard, was, murdered, on, 30, april, 1002, which, enabled, henry, of, bavaria, to, defeat, his, last, opponent, herman, ii, duke, of, swabia, fearing, that, henry, ii, would, side, with, elements, in, the, german, church, hierarchy, which, were, unfavorable, towards, poland, and, taking, advantage, of, the, chaos, that, followed, margrave, eckard, s, death, and, henry, of, bavaria, s, conflict, with, henry, of, schweinfurt, boles, aw, invaded, lusatia, and, meissen, he, seized, margrave, gero, s, march, as, far, as, the, river, elbe, and, also, bautzen, strehla, and, meissen, at, the, end, of, july, he, participated, at, a, meeting, of, the, saxon, lords, where, henry, of, bavaria, who, had, meanwhile, been, crowned, king, of, germany, only, confirmed, boles, aw, s, possession, of, lusatia, and, granted, meissen, to, margrave, eckard, s, brother, gunzelin, and, strehla, to, eckard, s, oldest, son, herman, the, relationship, between, king, henry, and, boles, aw, became, tense, after, assassins, tried, to, murder, boles, aw, in, merseburg, because, he, accused, the, king, of, conspiracy, against, him, in, retaliation, he, seized, and, burned, strehla, and, took, the, inhabitants, of, the, town, into, captivity, duke, boleslaus, iii, of, bohemia, was, dethroned, and, the, bohemian, lords, made, vladivoj, who, had, earlier, fled, to, poland, duke, in, 1002, the, czech, historian, du, an, t, e, t, k, writes, that, vladivoj, seized, the, bohemian, throne, with, boles, aw, s, assistance, after, vladivoj, died, in, 1003, boles, aw, invaded, bohemia, and, restored, boleslaus, iii, who, had, many, bohemian, noblemen, murdered, the, bohemian, lords, who, survived, the, massacre, secretly, sent, representatives, to, boles, aw, asking, him, to, rescue, them, from, fear, of, the, future, according, to, thietmar, of, merseburg, boles, aw, invaded, bohemia, and, had, boleslaus, iii, blinded, he, entered, prague, in, march, 1003, where, the, bohemian, lords, proclaimed, him, duke, king, henry, sent, his, envoys, to, prague, demanding, that, boles, aw, take, an, oath, of, loyalty, and, pay, tribute, to, him, but, boles, aw, refused, to, obey, he, also, allied, himself, with, the, king, s, opponents, including, henry, of, schweinfurt, to, whom, he, sent, reinforcements, king, henry, defeated, henry, of, schweinfurt, forcing, him, to, flee, to, bohemia, in, august, 1003, boles, aw, invaded, the, margraviate, of, meissen, but, margrave, gunzelin, refused, to, surrender, his, capital, it, is, also, likely, that, polish, forces, took, control, of, moravia, and, the, northern, parts, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, present, day, mostly, slovakia, in, 1003, as, well, the, proper, conquest, date, of, the, hungarian, territories, is, 1003, or, 1015, and, this, area, stayed, a, part, of, poland, until, 1018, king, henry, allied, himself, with, the, pagan, lutici, and, broke, into, lusatia, in, february, 1004, but, heavy, snows, forced, him, to, withdraw, he, invaded, bohemia, in, august, 1004, taking, the, oldest, brother, of, the, blinded, boleslaus, iii, of, bohemia, jarom, r, with, him, the, bohemians, rose, up, in, open, rebellion, and, murdered, the, polish, garrisons, in, the, major, towns, boles, aw, left, prague, without, resistance, and, king, henry, made, jarom, r, duke, of, bohemia, on, 8, september, boles, aw, s, ally, sob, slav, died, in, this, campaign, during, the, next, part, of, the, offensive, king, henry, retook, meissen, and, in, 1005, his, army, advanced, as, far, into, poland, as, the, city, of, pozna, where, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, according, to, the, peace, treaty, boles, aw, lost, lusatia, and, meissen, and, likely, gave, up, his, claim, to, the, bohemian, throne, also, in, 1005, a, pagan, rebellion, in, pomerania, overturned, boles, aw, s, rule, and, resulted, in, the, destruction, of, the, newly, established, local, bishopric, in, 1007, after, learning, about, boles, aw, s, efforts, to, gain, allies, among, saxon, nobles, and, giving, refuge, to, the, deposed, duke, of, bohemia, old, ich, king, henry, denounced, the, peace, of, pozna, which, caused, boles, aw, s, attack, on, the, archbishopric, of, magdeburg, as, well, as, the, re, occupation, of, the, marches, of, lusatia, though, he, stopped, short, of, retaking, meissen, the, german, counter, offensive, began, three, years, later, previously, henry, was, occupied, with, rebellion, in, flanders, in, 1010, but, it, was, of, no, significant, consequence, in, 1012, another, ineffective, campaign, by, archbishop, walthard, of, magdeburg, was, launched, as, he, died, during, that, campaign, and, consequently, his, forces, returned, home, later, that, year, boles, aw, once, again, invaded, lusatia, boles, aw, s, forces, pillaged, and, burned, the, city, of, lubusz, lebus, in, 1013, a, peace, accord, was, signed, at, merseburg, as, part, of, the, treaty, boles, aw, paid, homage, to, king, henry, for, the, march, of, lusatia, including, the, town, of, bautzen, and, sorbian, meissen, as, fiefs, a, marriage, of, boles, aw, s, son, mieszko, with, richeza, of, lotharingia, daughter, of, the, count, palatine, ezzo, of, lotharingia, and, granddaughter, of, emperor, otto, ii, was, also, performed, during, the, brief, period, of, peace, on, the, western, frontier, that, followed, boles, aw, took, part, in, a, short, campaign, in, the, east, towards, the, kievan, rus, territories, in, 1014, boles, aw, sent, his, son, mieszko, to, bohemia, in, order, to, form, an, alliance, with, duke, oldrich, against, henry, by, then, crowned, emperor, oldrich, imprisoned, mieszko, and, turned, him, over, to, henry, who, however, released, him, in, a, gesture, of, good, will, after, being, pressured, by, saxon, nobles, boles, aw, nonetheless, refused, to, aid, the, emperor, militarily, in, his, italian, expedition, this, led, to, imperial, intervention, in, poland, and, so, in, 1015, a, war, erupted, once, again, the, war, started, out, well, for, the, emperor, as, he, was, able, to, defeat, the, polish, forces, at, the, battle, of, ciani, once, the, imperial, forces, crossed, the, river, oder, boles, aw, sent, a, detachment, of, moravian, knights, in, a, diversionary, attack, against, the, eastern, march, of, the, empire, soon, after, the, imperial, army, having, suffered, a, defeat, near, the, b, br, marshes, retreated, from, poland, without, any, permanent, gains, after, this, event, boles, aw, s, forces, took, the, initiative, margrave, gero, ii, of, meissen, was, defeated, and, killed, during, a, clash, with, the, polish, forces, in, late, 1015, in, 1015, and, 1017, boles, aw, i, attacked, the, eastern, march, and, was, defeated, twice, by, henry, the, strong, and, his, forces, later, that, year, boles, aw, s, son, mieszko, was, sent, to, plunder, meissen, his, attempt, at,

to, retreat, suffering, significant, losses, taking, advantage, of, the, involvement, of, czech, troops, boles, aw, ordered, his, son, to, invade, bohemia, where, mieszko, met, very, little,
