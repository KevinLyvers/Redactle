https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollonius_of_Perga
apollonius, of, perga, greek, apoll, nios, ho, perga, os, c, 240, bc, c, 190, bc, was, an, ancient, greek, geometer, and, astronomer, known, for, his, work, on, conic, sections, beginning, from, the, earlier, contributions, of, euclid, and, archimedes, on, the, topic, he, brought, them, to, the, state, prior, to, the, invention, of, analytic, geometry, his, definitions, of, the, terms, ellipse, parabola, and, hyperbola, are, the, ones, in, use, today, with, his, predecessors, euclid, and, archimedes, apollonius, is, generally, considered, among, the, greatest, mathematicians, of, antiquity, aside, from, geometry, apollonius, worked, on, numerous, other, topics, including, astronomy, most, of, this, work, has, not, survived, where, exceptions, are, typically, fragments, referenced, by, other, authors, like, pappus, of, alexandria, his, hypothesis, of, eccentric, orbits, to, explain, the, apparently, aberrant, motion, of, the, planets, commonly, believed, until, the, middle, ages, was, superseded, during, the, renaissance, the, apollonius, crater, on, the, moon, is, named, in, his, honor, despite, his, momentous, contributions, to, the, field, of, mathematics, scant, biographical, information, on, apollonius, remains, the, 6th, century, greek, commentator, eutocius, of, ascalon, writing, on, apollonius, conics, states, apollonius, the, geometrician, came, from, perga, in, pamphylia, in, the, times, of, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, so, records, herakleios, the, biographer, of, archimedes, from, this, passage, apollonius, can, be, approximately, dated, but, specific, birth, and, death, years, stated, by, modern, scholars, are, only, speculative, ptolemy, iii, euergetes, benefactor, was, third, greek, dynast, of, egypt, in, the, diadochi, succession, who, reigned, 246, 222, 221, bc, times, are, always, recorded, by, ruler, or, officiating, magistrate, so, apollonius, was, likely, born, after, 246, the, identity, of, herakleios, is, uncertain, perga, was, a, hellenized, city, in, pamphylia, anatolia, whose, ruins, yet, stand, it, was, a, center, of, hellenistic, culture, eutocius, appears, to, associate, perga, with, the, ptolemaic, dynasty, of, egypt, never, under, egypt, perga, in, 246, bc, belonged, to, the, seleucid, empire, an, independent, diadochi, state, ruled, by, the, seleucid, dynasty, during, the, last, half, of, the, 3rd, century, bc, perga, changed, hands, a, number, of, times, being, alternatively, under, the, seleucids, and, under, the, attalids, of, pergamon, to, the, north, someone, designated, of, perga, might, be, expected, to, have, lived, and, worked, there, to, the, contrary, if, apollonius, was, later, identified, with, perga, it, was, not, on, the, basis, of, his, residence, the, remaining, autobiographical, material, implies, that, he, lived, studied, and, wrote, in, alexandria, a, letter, by, the, greek, mathematician, and, astronomer, hypsicles, was, originally, part, of, the, supplement, taken, from, euclid, s, book, xiv, part, of, the, thirteen, books, of, euclid, s, elements, basilides, of, tyre, o, protarchus, when, he, came, to, alexandria, and, met, my, father, spent, the, greater, part, of, his, sojourn, with, him, on, account, of, the, bond, between, them, due, to, their, common, interest, in, mathematics, and, on, one, occasion, when, looking, into, the, tract, written, by, apollonius, about, the, comparison, of, the, dodecahedron, and, icosahedron, inscribed, in, one, and, the, same, sphere, that, is, to, say, on, the, question, what, ratio, they, bear, to, one, another, they, came, to, the, conclusion, that, apollonius, treatment, of, it, in, this, book, was, not, correct, accordingly, as, i, understood, from, my, father, they, proceeded, to, amend, and, rewrite, it, but, i, myself, afterwards, came, across, another, book, published, by, apollonius, containing, a, demonstration, of, the, matter, in, question, and, i, was, greatly, attracted, by, his, investigation, of, the, problem, now, the, book, published, by, apollonius, is, accessible, to, all, for, it, has, a, large, circulation, in, a, form, which, seems, to, have, been, the, result, of, later, careful, elaboration, some, autobiographical, material, can, be, found, in, the, surviving, prefaces, to, the, books, of, conics, these, are, letters, apollonius, addressed, to, influential, friends, asking, them, to, review, the, book, enclosed, with, the, letter, the, first, two, prefaces, are, addressed, to, eudemus, of, pergamon, eudemus, likely, was, or, became, the, head, of, the, research, center, of, the, museum, of, pergamon, a, city, known, for, its, books, and, parchment, industry, from, which, the, name, parchment, is, derived, research, in, greek, mathematical, institutions, which, followed, the, model, of, the, athenian, lycaeum, was, part, of, the, educational, effort, to, which, the, library, and, museum, were, adjunct, there, was, only, one, such, school, in, the, state, under, royal, patronage, books, were, rare, and, expensive, and, collecting, them, was, a, royal, obligation, apollonius, s, preface, to, book, i, tells, eudemus, that, the, first, four, books, were, concerned, with, the, development, of, elements, while, the, last, four, were, concerned, with, special, topics, apollonius, reminds, eudemus, that, conics, was, initially, requested, by, naucrates, a, geometer, and, house, guest, at, alexandria, otherwise, unknown, to, history, apollonius, provided, naucrates, the, first, draft, of, all, eight, books, but, he, refers, to, them, as, being, without, a, thorough, purgation, and, intended, to, verify, and, correct, the, books, releasing, each, one, as, it, was, completed, having, heard, this, plan, from, apollonius, himself, who, visited, pergamon, eudemus, insisted, apollonius, send, him, each, book, before, release, at, this, stage, apollonius, was, likely, still, a, young, geometer, who, according, to, pappus, stayed, at, alexandria, with, the, students, of, euclid, long, after, euclid, s, time, perhaps, the, final, stage, of, his, education, eudemus, may, have, been, a, mentor, from, appolonius, time, in, pergamon, there, is, a, gap, between, the, first, and, second, prefaces, apollonius, has, sent, his, son, also, named, apollonius, to, deliver, the, second, he, speaks, with, more, confidence, suggesting, that, eudemus, use, the, book, in, special, study, groups, apollonius, mentions, meeting, philonides, of, laodicea, a, geometer, whom, he, introduced, to, eudemus, in, ephesus, and, who, became, eudemus, student, philonides, lived, mainly, in, syria, during, the, 1st, half, of, the, 2nd, century, bc, whether, the, meeting, indicates, that, apollonius, now, lived, in, ephesus, is, unresolved, the, intellectual, community, of, the, mediterranean, was, cosmopolitan, and, scholars, in, this, golden, age, of, mathematics, sought, employment, internationally, visited, each, other, read, each, other, s, works, and, made, suggestions, recommended, students, and, communicated, via, some, sort, of, postal, service, surviving, letters, are, abundant, the, preface, to, book, iii, is, missing, and, during, the, interval, eudemus, died, says, apollonius, in, the, preface, to, book, iv, prefaces, to, books, iv, vii, are, more, formal, mere, summaries, omitting, personal, information, all, four, are, addressed, to, a, mysterious, attalus, a, choice, made, apollonius, says, because, of, your, earnest, desire, to, possess, my, works, presumably, attalus, was, important, to, be, sent, apollonius, manuscripts, one, theory, is, that, attalus, is, attalus, ii, philadelphus, 220, 138, bc, general, and, defender, of, pergamon, whose, brother, eumenes, ii, was, king, and, who, became, co, regent, after, his, brother, s, illness, in, 160, bc, and, acceded, to, the, throne, in, 158, bc, both, brothers, were, patrons, of, the, arts, expanding, the, library, into, international, magnificence, attalus, was, a, contemporary, of, philonides, and, apollonius, motive, is, consonant, with, attalus, book, collecting, initiative, in, preface, vii, apollonius, describes, book, viii, as, an, appendix, which, i, will, take, care, to, send, you, as, speedily, as, possible, there, is, no, record, that, it, was, ever, sent, and, apollonius, might, have, died, before, finishing, it, pappus, of, alexandria, however, provided, lemmas, for, it, so, it, must, have, been, in, circulation, in, some, form, apollonius, was, a, prolific, geometer, turning, out, a, large, number, of, works, only, one, survives, conics, of, its, eight, books, only, the, first, four, persist, as, untranslated, original, texts, of, apollonius, books, 5, 7, are, only, available, in, an, arabic, translation, by, th, bit, ibn, qurra, commissioned, by, the, ban, m, s, the, original, greek, is, lost, the, status, of, book, 8, is, unknown, a, first, draft, existed, but, whether, the, final, draft, was, ever, produced, is, not, known, a, reconstruction, of, it, by, edmond, halley, exists, in, latin, but, there, is, no, way, to, know, how, much, of, it, if, any, is, verisimilar, to, apollonius, the, greek, text, of, conics, uses, the, euclidean, arrangement, of, definitions, figures, and, their, parts, i, e, the, givens, followed, by, propositions, to, be, proved, books, i, vii, present, 387, propositions, this, type, of, arrangement, can, be, seen, in, any, modern, geometry, textbook, of, the, traditional, subject, matter, as, in, any, course, of, mathematics, the, material, is, very, dense, and, consideration, of, it, necessarily, slow, apollonius, had, a, plan, for, each, book, which, is, partly, described, in, the, prefaces, the, headings, or, pointers, to, the, plan, are, somewhat, in, deficit, apollonius, having, depended, more, on, the, logical, flow, of, the, topics, book, i, presents, 58, propositions, its, most, salient, content, is, all, the, basic, definitions, concerning, cones, and, conic, sections, these, definitions, are, not, exactly, the, same, as, the, modern, ones, of, the, same, words, etymologically, the, modern, words, derive, from, the, ancient, but, the, etymon, often, differs, in, meaning, from, its, reflex, a, conical, surface, is, generated, by, a, line, segment, rotated, about, a, bisector, point, such, that, the, end, points, trace, circles, each, in, its, own, plane, a, cone, one, branch, of, the, double, conical, surface, is, the, surface, with, the, point, apex, or, vertex, the, circle, base, and, the, axis, a, line, joining, vertex, and, center, of, base, a, section, latin, sectio, greek, tome, is, an, imaginary, cutting, of, a, cone, by, a, plane, the, greek, geometers, were, interested, in, laying, out, select, figures, from, their, inventory, in, various, applications, of, engineering, and, architecture, as, the, great, inventors, such, as, archimedes, were, accustomed, to, doing, a, demand, for, conic, sections, existed, then, and, exists, now, the, development, of, mathematical, characterization, had, moved, geometry, in, the, direction, of, greek, geometric, algebra, which, visually, features, such, algebraic, fundamentals, as, assigning, values, to, line, segments, as, variables, they, used, a, coordinate, system, intermediate, between, a, grid, of, measurements, and, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, the, theories, of, proportion, and, application, of, areas, allowed, the, development, of, visual, equations, see, below, under, methods, of, apollonius, the, application, of, areas, implicitly, asks, given, an, area, and, a, line, segment, does, this, area, apply, that, is, is, it, equal, to, the, square, on, the, segment, if, yes, an, applicability, parabole, has, been, established, apollonius, followed, euclid, in, asking, if, a, rectangle, on, the, abscissa, of, any, point, on, the, section, applies, to, the, square, of, the, ordinate, if, it, does, his, word, equation, is, the, equivalent, of, y, 2, k, x, textstyle, y, 2, kx, which, is, one, modern, form, of, the, equation, for, a, parabola, the, rectangle, has, sides, k, displaystyle, k, and, x, displaystyle, x, it, was, he, who, accordingly, named, the, figure, parabola, application, the, no, applicability, case, is, further, divided, into, two, possibilities, given, a, function, f, x, textstyle, f, x, such, that, in, the, applicability, case, y, 2, g, x, textstyle, y, 2, g, x, in, the, no, applicability, case, either, y, 2, g, x, textstyle, y, 2, g, x, or, y, 2, g, x, textstyle, y, 2, g, x, in, the, former, g, x, displaystyle, g, x, falls, short, of, y, 2, textstyle, y, 2, by, a, quantity, termed, the, ellipsis, deficit, in, the, latter, g, x, displaystyle, g, x, overshoots, by, a, quantity, termed, the, hyperbole, surfeit, applicability, could, be, achieved, by, adding, the, deficit, y, 2, f, x, g, x, d, textstyle, y, 2, f, x, g, x, d, or, subtracting, the, surfeit, g, x, s, displaystyle, g, x, s, the, figure, compensating, for, a, deficit, was, named, an, ellipse, for, a, surfeit, a, hyperbola, the, terms, of, the, modern, equation, depend, on, the, translation, and, rotation, of, the, figure, from, the, origin, but, the, general, equation, for, an, ellipse, can, be, placed, in, the, form, where, c, b, displaystyle, c, b, is, the, deficit, while, an, equation, for, the, hyperbola, becomes, where, c, b, displaystyle, c, b, is, the, surfeit, book, ii, contains, 53, propositions, apollonius, says, that, he, intended, to, cover, the, properties, having, to, do, with, the, diameters, and, axes, and, also, the, asymptotes, and, other, things, for, limits, of, possibility, his, definition, of, diameter, is, different, from, the, traditional, as, he, finds, it, necessary, to, refer, the, intended, recipient, of, the, letter, to, his, work, for, a, definition, the, elements, mentioned, are, those, that, specify, the, shape, and, generation, of, the, figures, tangents, are, covered, at, the, end, of, the, book, book, iii, contains, 56, propositions, apollonius, claims, original, discovery, for, theorems, of, use, for, the, construction, of, solid, loci, the, three, line, and, four, line, locus, the, locus, of, a, conic, section, is, the, section, the, three, line, locus, problem, as, stated, by, taliafero, s, appendix, to, book, iii, finds, the, locus, of, points, whose, distances, from, three, given, fixed, straight, lines, are, such, that, the, square, of, one, of, the, distances, is, always, in, a, constant, ratio, to, the, rectangle, contained, by, the, other, two, distances, this, is, the, proof, of, the, application, of, areas, resulting, in, the, parabola, the, four, line, problem, results, in, the, ellipse, and, hyperbola, analytic, geometry, derives, the, same, loci, from, simpler, criteria, supported, by, algebra, rather, than, geometry, for, which, descartes, was, highly, praised, he, supersedes, apollonius, in, his, methods, book, iv, contains, 57, propositions, the, first, sent, to, attalus, rather, than, to, eudemus, it, thus, represents, his, more, mature, geometric, thought, the, topic, is, rather, specialized, the, greatest, number, of, points, at, which, sections, of, a, cone, can, meet, one, another, or, meet, a, circumference, of, a, circle, nevertheless, he, speaks, with, enthusiasm, labeling, them, of, considerable, use, in, solving, problems, preface, 4, book, v, known, only, through, translation, from, the, arabic, contains, 77, propositions, the, most, of, any, book, they, cover, the, ellipse, 50, propositions, the, parabola, 22, and, the, hyperbola, 28, these, are, not, explicitly, the, topic, which, in, prefaces, i, and, v, apollonius, states, to, be, maximum, and, minimum, lines, these, terms, are, not, explained, in, contrast, to, book, i, book, v, contains, no, definitions, and, no, explanation, the, ambiguity, has, served, as, a, magnet, to, exegetes, of, apollonius, who, must, interpret, without, sure, knowledge, of, the, meaning, of, the, book, s, major, terms, until, recently, heath, s, view, prevailed, the, lines, are, to, be, treated, as, normals, to, the, sections, a, normal, in, this, case, is, the, perpendicular, to, a, curve, at, a, tangent, point, sometimes, called, the, foot, if, a, section, is, plotted, according, to, apollonius, coordinate, system, see, below, under, methods, of, apollonius, with, the, diameter, translated, by, heath, as, the, axis, on, the, x, axis, and, the, vertex, at, the, origin, on, the, left, the, phraseology, of, the, propositions, indicates, that, the, minima, maxima, are, to, be, found, between, the, section, and, the, axis, heath, is, led, into, his, view, by, consideration, of, a, fixed, point, p, on, the, section, serving, both, as, tangent, point, and, as, one, end, of, the, line, the, minimum, distance, between, p, and, some, point, g, on, the, axis, must, then, be, the, normal, from, p, in, modern, mathematics, normals, to, curves, are, known, for, being, the, location, of, the, center, of, curvature, of, that, small, part, of, the, curve, located, around, the, foot, the, distance, from, the, foot, to, the, center, is, the, radius, of, curvature, the, latter, is, the, radius, of, a, circle, but, for, other, than, circular, curves, the, small, arc, can, be, approximated, by, a, circular, arc, the, curvature, of, non, circular, curves, e, g, the, conic, sections, must, change, over, the, section, a, map, of, the, center, of, curvature, i, e, its, locus, as, the, foot, moves, over, the, section, is, termed, the, evolute, of, the, section, such, a, figure, the, edge, of, the, successive, positions, of, a, line, is, termed, an, envelope, today, heath, believed, that, in, book, v, we, are, seeing, apollonius, establish, the, logical, foundation, of, a, theory, of, normals, evolutes, and, envelopes, heath, s, was, accepted, as, the, authoritative, interpretation, of, book, v, for, the, entire, 20th, century, but, the, changing, of, the, century, brought, with, it, a, change, of, view, in, 2001, apollonius, scholars, fried, unguru, granting, all, due, respect, to, other, heath, chapters, balked, at, the, historicity, of, heath, s, analysis, of, book, v, asserting, that, he, reworks, the, original, to, make, it, more, congenial, to, a, modern, mathematician, this, is, the, kind, of, thing, that, makes, heath, s, work, of, dubious, value, for, the, historian, revealing, more, of, heath, s, mind, than, that, of, apollonius, some, of, his, arguments, are, in, summary, as, follows, there, is, no, mention, of, maxima, minima, being, per, se, normals, in, either, the, prefaces, or, the, books, proper, out, of, heath, s, selection, of, 50, propositions, said, to, cover, normals, only, 7, book, v, 27, 33, state, or, imply, maximum, minimum, lines, being, perpendicular, to, the, tangents, these, 7, fried, classifies, as, isolated, unrelated, to, the, main, propositions, of, the, book, they, do, not, in, any, way, imply, that, maxima, minima, in, general, are, normals, in, his, extensive, investigation, of, the, other, 43, propositions, fried, proves, that, many, cannot, be, fried, and, unguru, counter, by, portraying, apollonius, as, a, continuation, of, the, past, rather, than, a, foreshadowing, of, the, future, first, is, a, complete, philological, study, of, all, references, to, minimum, and, maximum, lines, which, uncovers, a, standard, phraseology, there, are, three, groups, of, 20, 25, propositions, each, the, first, group, contains, the, phrase, from, a, point, on, the, axis, to, the, section, which, is, exactly, the, opposite, of, a, hypothetical, from, a, point, on, the, section, to, the, axis, the, former, does, not, have, to, be, normal, to, anything, although, it, might, be, given, a, fixed, point, on, the, axis, of, all, the, lines, connecting, it, to, all, the, points, of, the, section, one, will, be, longest, maximum, and, one, shortest, minimum, other, phrases, are, in, a, section, drawn, from, a, section, cut, off, between, the, section, and, its, axis, cut, off, by, the, axis, all, referring, to, the, same, image, in, the, view, of, fried, and, unguru, the, topic, of, book, v, is, exactly, what, apollonius, says, it, is, maximum, and, minimum, lines, these, are, not, code, words, for, future, concepts, but, refer, to, ancient, concepts, then, in, use, the, authors, cite, euclid, elements, book, iii, which, concerns, itself, with, circles, and, maximum, and, minimum, distances, from, interior, points, to, the, circumference, without, admitting, to, any, specific, generality, they, use, terms, such, as, like, or, the, analog, of, they, are, known, for, innovating, the, term, neusis, like, a, neusis, construction, was, a, method, of, fitting, a, given, segment, between, two, given, curves, given, a, point, p, and, a, ruler, with, the, segment, marked, off, on, it, one, rotates, the, ruler, around, p, cutting, the, two, curves, until, the, segment, is, fitted, between, them, in, book, v, p, is, the, point, on, the, axis, rotating, a, ruler, around, it, one, discovers, the, distances, to, the, section, from, which, the, minimum, and, maximum, can, be, discerned, the, technique, is, not, applied, to, the, situation, so, it, is, not, neusis, the, authors, use, neusis, like, seeing, an, archetypal, similarity, to, the, ancient, method, book, vi, known, only, through, translation, from, the, arabic, contains, 33, propositions, the, least, of, any, book, it, also, has, large, lacunae, or, gaps, in, the, text, due, to, damage, or, corruption, in, the, previous, texts, the, topic, is, relatively, clear, and, uncontroversial, preface, 1, states, that, it, is, equal, and, similar, sections, of, cones, apollonius, extends, the, concepts, of, congruence, and, similarity, presented, by, euclid, for, more, elementary, figures, such, as, triangles, quadrilaterals, to, conic, sections, preface, 6, mentions, sections, and, segments, that, are, equal, and, unequal, as, well, as, similar, and, dissimilar, and, adds, some, constructional, information, book, vi, features, a, return, to, the, basic, definitions, at, the, front, of, the, book, equality, is, determined, by, an, application, of, areas, if, one, figure, that, is, a, section, or, a, segment, is, applied, to, another, halley, s, si, applicari, possit, altera, super, alteram, they, are, equal, halley, s, aequales, if, they, coincide, and, no, line, of, one, crosses, any, line, of, the, other, this, is, obviously, a, standard, of, congruence, following, euclid, book, i, common, notions, 4, and, things, coinciding, epharmazanta, with, one, another, are, equal, isa, coincidence, and, equality, overlap, but, they, are, not, the, same, the, application, of, areas, used, to, define, the, sections, depends, on, quantitative, equality, of, areas, but, they, can, belong, to, different, figures, between, instances, that, are, the, same, homos, being, equal, to, each, other, and, those, that, are, different, or, unequal, are, figures, that, are, same, ish, hom, oios, or, similar, they, are, neither, entirely, the, same, nor, different, but, share, aspects, that, are, the, same, and, do, not, share, aspects, that, are, different, intuitively, the, geometricians, had, scale, in, mind, e, g, a, map, is, similar, to, a, topographic, region, thus, figures, could, have, larger, or, smaller, versions, of, themselves, the, aspects, that, are, the, same, in, similar, figures, depend, on, the, figure, book, 6, of, euclid, s, elements, presents, similar, triangles, as, those, that, have, the, same, corresponding, angles, a, triangle, can, thus, have, miniatures, as, small, as, you, please, or, giant, versions, and, still, be, the, same, triangle, as, the, original, in, apollonius, definitions, at, the, beginning, of, book, vi, similar, right, cones, have, similar, axial, triangles, similar, sections, and, segments, of, sections, are, first, of, all, in, similar, cones, in, addition, for, every, abscissa, of, one, must, exist, an, abscissa, in, the, other, at, the, desired, scale, finally, abscissa, and, ordinate, of, one, must, be, matched, by, coordinates, of, the, same, ratio, of, ordinate, to, abscissa, as, the, other, the, total, effect, is, as, though, the, section, or, segment, were, moved, up, and, down, the, cone, to, achieve, a, different, scale, book, vii, also, a, translation, from, the, arabic, contains, 51, propositions, these, are, the, last, that, heath, considers, in, his, 1896, edition, in, preface, i, apollonius, does, not, mention, them, implying, that, at, the, time, of, the, first, draft, they, may, not, have, existed, in, sufficiently, coherent, form, to, describe, apollonius, uses, obscure, language, that, they, are, peri, dioristikon, theorematon, which, halley, translated, as, de, theorematis, ad, determinationem, pertinentibus, and, heath, as, theorems, involving, determinations, of, limits, this, is, the, language, of, definition, but, no, definitions, are, forthcoming, whether, the, reference, might, be, to, a, specific, kind, of, definition, is, a, consideration, but, to, date, nothing, credible, has, been, proposed, the, topic, of, book, vii, completed, toward, the, end, of, apollonius, life, and, career, is, stated, in, preface, vii, to, be, diameters, and, the, figures, described, upon, them, which, must, include, conjugate, diameters, as, he, relies, heavily, on, them, in, what, way, the, term, limits, or, determinations, might, apply, is, not, mentioned, diameters, and, their, conjugates, are, defined, in, book, i, definitions, 4, 6, not, every, diameter, has, a, conjugate, the, topography, of, a, diameter, greek, diametros, requires, a, regular, curved, figure, irregularly, shaped, areas, addressed, in, modern, times, are, not, in, the, ancient, game, plan, apollonius, has, in, mind, of, course, the, conic, sections, which, he, describes, in, often, convolute, language, a, curve, in, the, same, plane, is, a, circle, ellipse, or, parabola, while, two, curves, in, the, same, plane, is, a, hyperbola, a, chord, is, a, straight, line, whose, two, end, points, are, on, the, figure, i, e, it, cuts, the, figure, in, two, places, if, a, grid, of, parallel, chords, is, imposed, on, the, figure, then, the, diameter, is, defined, as, the, line, bisecting, all, the, chords, reaching, the, curve, itself, at, a, point, called, the, vertex, there, is, no, requirement, for, a, closed, figure, e, g, a, parabola, has, a, diameter, a, parabola, has, symmetry, in, one, dimension, if, you, imagine, it, folded, on, its, one, diameter, the, two, halves, are, congruent, or, fit, over, each, other, the, same, may, be, said, of, one, branch, of, a, hyperbola, conjugate, diameters, greek, suzugeis, diametroi, where, suzugeis, is, yoked, together, however, are, symmetric, in, two, dimensions, the, figures, to, which, they, apply, require, also, an, areal, center, greek, kentron, today, called, a, centroid, serving, as, a, center, of, symmetry, in, two, directions, these, figures, are, the, circle, ellipse, and, two, branched, hyperbola, there, is, only, one, centroid, which, must, not, be, confused, with, the, foci, a, diameter, is, a, chord, passing, through, the, centroid, which, always, bisects, it, for, the, circle, and, ellipse, let, a, grid, of, parallel, chords, be, superimposed, over, the, figure, such, that, the, longest, is, a, diameter, and, the, others, are, successively, shorter, until, the, last, is, not, a, chord, but, is, a, tangent, point, the, tangent, must, be, parallel, to, the, diameter, a, conjugate, diameter, bisects, the, chords, being, placed, between, the, centroid, and, the, tangent, point, moreover, both, diameters, are, conjugate, to, each, other, being, called, a, conjugate, pair, it, is, obvious, that, any, conjugate, pair, of, a, circle, are, perpendicular, to, each, other, but, in, an, ellipse, only, the, major, and, minor, axes, are, the, elongation, destroying, the, perpendicularity, in, all, other, cases, conjugates, are, defined, for, the, two, branches, of, a, hyperbola, resulting, from, the, cutting, of, a, double, cone, by, a, single, plane, they, are, called, conjugate, branches, they, have, the, same, diameter, its, centroid, bisects, the, segment, between, vertices, there, is, room, for, one, more, diameter, like, line, let, a, grid, of, lines, parallel, to, the, diameter, cut, both, branches, of, the, hyperbola, these, lines, are, chord, like, except, that, they, do, not, terminate, on, the, same, continuous, curve, a, conjugate, diameter, can, be, drawn, from, the, centroid, to, bisect, the, chord, like, lines, these, concepts, mainly, from, book, i, get, us, started, on, the, 51, propositions, of, book, vii, defining, in, detail, the, relationships, between, sections, diameters, and, conjugate, diameters, as, with, some, of, apollonius, other, specialized, topics, their, utility, today, compared, to, analytic, geometry, remains, to, be, seen, although, he, affirms, in, preface, vii, that, they, are, both, useful, and, innovative, i, e, he, takes, the, credit, for, them, the, early, printed, editions, began, for, the, most, part, in, the, 16th, century, at, that, time, in, europe, scholarly, books, were, expected, to, be, in, neo, latin, as, few, mathematical, manuscripts, were, written, in, latin, the, editors, of, the, early, printed, works, translated, from, greek, or, arabic, often, greek, and, latin, were, juxtaposed, with, the, greek, text, representing, either, the, original, or, an, editor, s, restoration, critical, commentary, of, the, time, was, typically, in, latin, earlier, commentaries, had, been, written, in, ancient, or, medieval, greek, or, arabic, only, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, did, editions, in, modern, languages, begin, to, appear, a, representative, list, of, early, printed, editions, is, given, below, the, difficulty, of, conics, made, an, intellectual, niche, for, later, commentators, each, presenting, apollonius, in, the, most, lucid, and, relevant, way, for, his, own, times, they, use, a, variety, of, methods, annotation, extensive, prefatory, material, different, formats, additional, drawings, superficial, reorganization, by, the, addition, of, capita, and, so, on, there, are, subtle, variations, in, interpretation, limited, material, about, conics, was, ever, written, in, english, because, european, mathematicians, of, the, 16th, 18th, century, including, english, mathematicians, such, as, edmund, halley, and, isaac, newton, preferred, neo, latin, in, later, centuries, geometry, was, re, established, using, coordinates, analytic, geometry, and, synthetic, methods, fell, out, of, favor, so, conics, direct, influence, on, mathematical, research, declined, presentations, written, entirely, in, native, english, begin, in, the, late, 19th, century, particularly, influential, is, thomas, heath, s, translation, treatise, on, conic, sections, his, extensive, prefatory, commentary, includes, such, items, as, a, lexicon, of, apollonian, geometric, terms, giving, the, greek, the, meanings, and, usage, commenting, that, the, apparently, portentious, bulk, of, the, treatise, has, deterred, many, from, attempting, to, make, its, acquaintance, he, promises, to, add, headings, changing, the, organization, superficially, and, to, clarify, the, text, with, modern, notation, his, work, thus, references, two, systems, of, organization, his, own, and, apollonius, parenthetically, cross, referenced, heath, was, active, in, the, late, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, passing, away, in, 1940, but, meanwhile, another, point, of, view, developed, st, john, s, college, annapolis, santa, fe, which, had, been, a, military, school, since, colonial, times, preceding, the, united, states, naval, academy, at, annapolis, maryland, to, which, it, is, adjacent, in, 1936, lost, its, accreditation, and, was, on, the, brink, of, bankruptcy, in, desperation, the, board, summoned, stringfellow, barr, and, scott, buchanan, from, the, university, of, chicago, where, they, had, been, developing, a, new, theoretical, program, for, instruction, of, the, classics, leaping, at, the, opportunity, in, 1937, they, instituted, the, new, program, at, st, john, s, later, dubbed, the, great, books, program, a, fixed, curriculum, that, would, teach, the, works, of, select, key, contributors, to, the, culture, of, western, civilization, at, st, john, s, apollonius, came, to, be, taught, as, himself, not, as, some, adjunct, to, analytic, geometry, the, tutor, of, apollonius, was, r, catesby, taliaferro, a, new, phd, in, 1937, from, the, university, of, virginia, he, tutored, until, 1942, and, then, later, for, one, year, in, 1948, supplying, the, english, translations, by, himself, translating, ptolemy, s, almagest, and, apollonius, conics, these, translations, became, part, of, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, s, great, books, of, the, western, world, series, only, books, i, iii, are, included, with, an, appendix, for, special, topics, a, translation, of, book, iv, of, the, conics, by, michael, n, fried, was, produced, in, 2002, unlike, heath, taliaferro, did, not, attempt, to, reorganize, apollonius, even, superficially, or, to, rewrite, him, his, translation, into, modern, english, follows, the, greek, fairly, closely, he, does, use, modern, geometric, notation, to, some, degree, contemporaneously, with, taliaferro, s, work, ivor, thomas, an, oxford, don, of, the, world, war, ii, era, was, taking, an, intense, interest, in, greek, mathematics, he, planned, a, compendium, of, selections, which, came, to, fruition, during, his, military, service, as, an, officer, in, the, royal, norfolk, regiment, after, the, war, it, found, a, home, in, the, loeb, classical, library, where, it, occupies, two, volumes, all, translated, by, thomas, with, the, greek, on, one, side, of, the, page, and, the, english, on, the, other, as, is, customary, for, the, loeb, series, thomas, work, has, served, as, a, handbook, for, the, golden, age, of, greek, mathematics, for, apollonius, he, only, includes, mainly, those, portions, of, book, i, that, define, the, sections, the, rest, of, apollonius, s, works, are, fragmentary, or, lost, many, of, the, lost, works, are, described, or, mentioned, by, commentators, in, addition, are, ideas, attributed, to, apollonius, by, other, authors, without, documentation, credible, or, not, they, are, hearsay, some, authors, identify, apollonius, as, the, author, of, certain, ideas, consequently, named, after, him, others, attempt, to, express, apollonius, in, modern, notation, or, phraseology, with, indeterminate, degrees, of, fidelity, edmond, halley, reconstructed, de, rationis, sectione, and, de, spatii, sectione, beyond, these, works, except, for, a, handful, of, fragments, documentation, that, might, in, any, way, be, interpreted, as, descending, from, apollonius, ends, besides, conics, pappus, mentions, other, treatises, of, apollonius, each, of, these, was, divided, into, two, books, and, with, the, data, the, porisms, and, surface, loci, of, euclid, and, the, conics, of, apollonius, were, according, to, pappus, included, in, the, body, of, the, ancient, analysis, descriptions, follow, of, the, six, works, mentioned, above, de, rationis, sectione, sought, to, resolve, a, simple, problem, given, two, straight, lines, and, a, point, in, each, draw, through, a, third, given, point, a, straight, line, cutting, the, two, fixed, lines, such, that, the, parts, intercepted, between, the, given, points, in, them, and, the, points, of, intersection, with, this, third, line, may, have, a, given, ratio, de, spatii, sectione, discussed, a, similar, problem, requiring, the, rectangle, contained, by, the, two, intercepts, to, be, equal, to, a, given, rectangle, in, the, late, 17th, century, edward, bernard, discovered, a, version, of, de, rationis, sectione, in, the, bodleian, library, although, he, began, a, translation, it, was, halley, who, finished, it, and, included, it, in, a, 1706, volume, with, his, restoration, of, de, spatii, sectione, de, sectione, determinata, deals, with, problems, in, a, manner, that, may, be, called, an, analytic, geometry, of, one, dimension, with, the, question, of, finding, points, on, a, line, that, were, in, a, ratio, to, the, others, the, specific, problems, are, given, two, three, or, four, points, on, a, straight, line, find, another, point, on, it, such, that, its, distances, from, the, given, points, satisfy, the, condition, that, the, square, on, one, or, the, rectangle, contained, by, two, has, a, given, ratio, either, 1, to, the, square, on, the, remaining, one, or, the, rectangle, contained, by, the, remaining, two, or, 2, to, the, rectangle, contained, by, the, remaining, one, and, another, given, straight, line, several, have, tried, to, restore, the, text, to, discover, apollonius, s, solution, among, them, snellius, willebrord, snell, leiden, 1698, alexander, anderson, of, aberdeen, in, the, supplement, to, his, apollonius, redivivus, paris, 1612, and, robert, simson, in, his, opera, quaedam, reliqua, glasgow, 1776, by, far, the, best, attempt, de, tactionibus, embraced, the, following, general, problem, given, three, things, points, straight, lines, or, circles, in, position, describe, a, circle, passing, through, the, given, points, and, touching, the, given, straight, lines, or, circles, the, most, difficult, and, historically, interesting, case, arises, when, the, three, given, things, are, circles, in, the, 16th, century, vieta, presented, this, problem, sometimes, known, as, the, apollonian, problem, to, adrianus, romanus, who, solved, it, with, a, hyperbola, vieta, thereupon, proposed, a, simpler, solution, eventually, leading, him, to, restore, the, whole, of, apollonius, s, treatise, in, the, small, work, apollonius, gallus, paris, 1600, the, history, of, the, problem, is, explored, in, fascinating, detail, in, the, preface, to, j, w, camerer, s, brief, apollonii, pergaei, quae, supersunt, ac, maxime, lemmata, pappi, in, hos, libras, cum, observationibus, c, gothae, 1795, 8vo, the, object, of, de, inclinationibus, was, to, demonstrate, how, a, straight, line, of, a, given, length, tending, towards, a, given, point, could, be, inserted, between, two, given, straight, or, circular, lines, though, marin, getaldi, and, hugo, d, omerique, geometrical, analysis, cadiz, 1698, attempted, restorations, the, best, is, by, samuel, horsley, 1770, de, locis, planis, is, a, collection, of, propositions, relating, to, loci, that, are, either, straight, lines, or, circles, since, pappus, gives, somewhat, full, particulars, of, its, propositions, this, text, has, also, seen, efforts, to, restore, it, not, only, by, p, fermat, oeuvres, i, 1891, pp, 3, 51, and, f, schooten, leiden, 1656, but, also, most, successfully, of, all, by, r, simson, glasgow, 1749, ancient, writers, refer, to, other, works, of, apollonius, that, are, no, longer, extant, the, equivalence, of, two, descriptions, of, planet, motions, one, using, eccentrics, and, another, deferent, and, epicycles, is, attributed, to, apollonius, ptolemy, describes, this, equivalence, in, the, almagest, according, to, heath, the, methods, of, apollonius, were, not, personal, to, him, whatever, influence, he, had, on, later, theorists, was, the, influence, of, geometry, not, of, his, own, innovation, of, technique, heath, says, as, a, preliminary, to, the, consideration, in, detail, of, the, methods, employed, in, the, conics, it, may, be, stated, generally, that, they, follow, steadily, the, accepted, principles, of, geometrical, investigation, which, found, their, definitive, expression, in, the, elements, of, euclid, when, referring, to, golden, age, geometers, modern, scholars, use, the, term, method, to, mean, the, visual, reconstructive, way, in, which, the, geometer, produces, a, result, equivalent, to, that, produced, by, algebra, today, as, a, simple, example, the, algebraic, method, to, compute, the, area, of, a, square, is, to, square, its, side, length, the, analogous, geometric, method, is, to, construct, a, visual, square, geometric, methods, in, the, golden, age, could, produce, most, of, the, results, of, elementary, algebra, heath, goes, on, to, use, the, term, geometrical, algebra, for, the, methods, of, the, entire, golden, age, the, term, had, been, defined, by, henry, burchard, fine, in, 1890, or, before, who, applied, it, to, la, g, om, trie, of, ren, descartes, the, first, full, blown, work, of, analytic, geometry, establishing, as, a, precondition, that, two, algebras, are, formally, identical, whose, fundamental, operations, are, formally, the, same, fine, says, that, descartes, work, is, not, mere, numerical, algebra, but, what, may, for, want, of, a, better, name, be, called, the, algebra, of, line, segments, its, symbolism, is, the, same, as, that, of, numerical, algebra, for, example, in, apollonius, a, line, segment, ab, the, line, between, point, a, and, point, b, is, also, the, numerical, length, of, the, segment, it, can, have, any, length, ab, therefore, becomes, the, same, as, an, algebraic, variable, such, as, x, the, unknown, to, which, any, value, might, be, assigned, e, g, x, 3, variables, are, defined, in, apollonius, by, such, word, statements, as, let, ab, be, the, distance, from, any, point, on, the, section, to, the, diameter, a, practice, that, continues, in, algebra, today, every, student, of, basic, algebra, must, learn, to, convert, word, problems, to, algebraic, variables, and, equations, to, which, the, rules, of, algebra, apply, in, solving, for, x, apollonius, had, no, such, rules, his, solutions, are, geometric, relationships, not, readily, amenable, to, pictorial, solutions, were, beyond, his, grasp, however, his, repertory, of, pictorial, solutions, came, from, a, pool, of, complex, geometric, solutions, generally, not, known, or, required, today, one, well, known, exception, is, the, indispensable, pythagorean, theorem, even, now, represented, by, a, right, triangle, with, squares, on, its, sides, illustrating, an, expression, such, as, a, 2, b, 2, c, 2, the, greek, geometers, called, those, terms, the, square, on, ab, etc, similarly, the, area, of, a, rectangle, formed, by, ab, and, cd, was, the, rectangle, on, ab, and, cd, these, concepts, gave, the, greek, geometers, algebraic, access, to, linear, functions, and, quadratic, functions, which, latter, the, conic, sections, are, they, contain, powers, of, 1, or, 2, respectively, apollonius, had, not, much, use, for, cubes, featured, in, solid, geometry, even, though, a, cone, is, a, solid, his, interest, was, in, conic, sections, which, are, plane, figures, powers, of, 4, and, up, were, beyond, visualization, requiring, a, degree, of, abstraction, not, available, in, geometry, but, ready, at, hand, in, algebra, all, ordinary, measurement, of, length, in, public, units, such, as, inches, using, standard, public, devices, such, as, a, ruler, implies, public, recognition, of, a, cartesian, grid, that, is, a, surface, divided, into, unit, squares, such, as, one, square, inch, and, a, space, divided, into, unit, cubes, such, as, one, cubic, inch, the, ancient, greek, units, of, measurement, had, provided, such, a, grid, to, greek, mathematicians, since, the, bronze, age, prior, to, apollonius, menaechmus, and, archimedes, had, already, started, locating, their, figures, on, an, implied, window, of, the, common, grid, by, referring, to, distances, conceived, to, be, measured, from, a, left, hand, vertical, line, marking, a, low, measure, and, a, bottom, horizontal, line, marking, a, low, measure, the, directions, being, rectilinear, or, perpendicular, to, one, another, these, edges, of, the, window, become, in, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, the, axes, one, specifies, the, rectilinear, distances, of, any, point, from, the, axes, as, the, coordinates, the, ancient, greeks, did, not, have, that, convention, they, simply, referred, to, distances, apollonius, does, have, a, standard, window, in, which, he, places, his, figures, vertical, measurement, is, from, a, horizontal, line, he, calls, the, diameter, the, word, is, the, same, in, greek, as, it, is, in, english, but, the, greek, is, somewhat, wider, in, its, comprehension, if, the, figure, of, the, conic, section, is, cut, by, a, grid, of, parallel, lines, the, diameter, bisects, all, the, line, segments, included, between, the, branches, of, the, figure, it, must, pass, through, the, vertex, koruphe, crown, a, diameter, thus, comprises, open, figures, such, as, a, parabola, as, well, as, closed, such, as, a, circle, there, is, no, specification, that, the, diameter, must, be, perpendicular, to, the, parallel, lines, but, apollonius, uses, only, rectilinear, ones, the, rectilinear, distance, from, a, point, on, the, section, to, the, diameter, is, termed, tetagmenos, in, greek, etymologically, simply, extended, as, it, is, only, ever, extended, down, kata, or, up, ana, the, translators, interpret, it, as, ordinate, in, that, case, the, diameter, becomes, the, x, axis, and, the, vertex, the, origin, the, y, axis, then, becomes, a, tangent, to, the, curve, at, the, vertex, the, abscissa, is, then, defined, as, the, segment, of, the, diameter, between, the, ordinate, and, the, vertex, using, his, version, of, a, coordinate, system, apollonius, manages, to, develop, in, pictorial, form, the, geometric, equivalents, of, the, equations, for, the, conic, sections, which, raises, the, question, of, whether, his, coordinate, system, can, be, considered, cartesian, there, are, some, differences, the, cartesian, system, is, to, be, regarded, as, universal, covering, all, figures, in, all, space, applied, before, any, calculation, is, done, it, has, four, quadrants, divided, by, the, two, crossed, axes, three, of, the, quadrants, include, negative, coordinates, meaning, directions, opposite, the, reference, axes, of, zero, apollonius, has, no, negative, numbers, does, not, explicitly, have, a, number, for, zero, and, does, not, develop, the, coordinate, system, independently, of, the, conic, sections, he, works, essentially, only, in, quadrant, 1, all, positive, coordinates, carl, boyer, a, modern, historian, of, mathematics, therefore, says, however, greek, geometric, algebra, did, not, provide, for, negative, magnitudes, moreover, the, coordinate, system, was, in, every, case, superimposed, a, posteriori, upon, a, given, curve, in, order, to, study, its, properties, apollonius, the, greatest, geometer, of, antiquity, failed, to, develop, analytic, geometry, nevertheless, according, to, boyer, apollonius, treatment, of, curves, is, in, some, ways, similar, to, the, modern, treatment, and, his, work, seems, to, anticipate, analytical, geometry, apollonius, occupies, some, sort, of, intermediate, niche, between, the, grid, system, of, conventional, measurement, and, the, fully, developed, cartesian, coordinate, system, of, analytic, geometry, in, reading, apollonius, one, must, take, care, not, to, assume, modern, meanings, for, his, terms, apollonius, uses, the, theory, of, proportions, as, expressed, in, euclid, s, elements, books, 5, and, 6, devised, by, eudoxus, of, cnidus, the, theory, is, intermediate, between, purely, graphic, methods, and, modern, number, theory, a, standard, decimal, number, system, is, lacking, as, is, a, standard, treatment, of, fractions, the, propositions, however, express, in, words, rules, for, manipulating, fractions, in, arithmetic, heath, proposes, that, they, stand, in, place, of, multiplication, and, division, by, the, term, magnitude, eudoxus, hoped, to, go, beyond, numbers, to, a, general, sense, of, size, a, meaning, it, still, retains, with, regard, to, the, figures, of, euclid, it, most, often, means, numbers, which, was, the, pythagorean, approach, pythagoras, believed, the, universe, could, be, characterized, by, quantities, which, belief, has, become, the, current, scientific, dogma, book, v, of, euclid, begins, by, insisting, that, a, magnitude, megethos, size, must, be, divisible, evenly, into, units, meros, part, a, magnitude, is, thus, a, multiple, of, units, they, do, not, have, to, be, standard, measurement, units, such, as, meters, or, feet, one, unit, can, be, any, designated, line, segment, there, follows, perhaps, the, most, useful, fundamental, definition, ever, devised, in, science, the, ratio, greek, logos, meaning, roughly, explanation, is, a, statement, of, relative, magnitude, given, two, magnitudes, say, of, segments, ab, and, cd, the, ratio, of, ab, to, cd, where, cd, is, considered, unit, is, the, number, of, cd, in, ab, for, example, 3, parts, of, 4, or, 60, parts, per, million, where, ppm, still, uses, the, parts, terminology, the, ratio, is, the, basis, of, the, modern, fraction, which, also, still, means, part, or, fragment, from, the, same, latin, root, as, fracture, the, ratio, is, the, basis, of, mathematical, prediction, in, the, logical, structure, called, a, proportion, greek, analogos, the, proportion, states, that, if, two, segments, ab, and, cd, have, the, same, ratio, as, two, others, ef, and, gh, then, ab, and, cd, are, proportional, to, ef, and, gh, or, as, would, be, said, in, euclid, ab, is, to, cd, as, ef, is, to, gh, algebra, reduces, this, general, concept, to, the, expression, ab, cd, ef, gh, given, any, three, of, the, terms, one, can, calculate, the, fourth, as, an, unknown, rearranging, the, above, equation, one, obtains, ab, cd, gh, ef, in, which, expressed, as, y, kx, the, cd, gh, is, known, as, the, constant, of, proportionality, the, greeks, had, little, difficulty, with, taking, multiples, greek, pollaplasiein, probably, by, successive, addition, apollonius, uses, ratios, almost, exclusively, of, line, segments, and, areas, which, are, designated, by, squares, and, rectangles, the, translators, have, undertaken, to, use, the, colon, notation, introduced, by, leibniz, in, acta, eruditorum, 1684, here, is, an, example, from, conics, book, i, on, proposition, 11
