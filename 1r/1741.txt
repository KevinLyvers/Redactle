john, bardeen, formemrs, b, r, d, i, n, may, 23, 1908, january, 30, 1991, was, an, american, physicist, and, electrical, engineer, he, is, the, only, person, to, be, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, twice, first, in, 1956, with, william, shockley, and, walter, brattain, for, the, invention, of, the, transistor, and, again, in, 1972, with, leon, n, cooper, and, john, robert, schrieffer, for, a, fundamental, theory, of, conventional, superconductivity, known, as, the, bcs, theory, the, transistor, revolutionized, the, electronics, industry, making, possible, the, development, of, almost, every, modern, electronic, device, from, telephones, to, computers, and, ushering, in, the, information, age, bardeen, s, developments, in, superconductivity, for, which, he, was, awarded, his, second, nobel, prize, are, used, in, nuclear, magnetic, resonance, spectroscopy, nmr, medical, magnetic, resonance, imaging, mri, and, superconducting, quantum, circuits, born, and, raised, in, wisconsin, bardeen, received, a, ph, d, in, physics, from, princeton, university, after, serving, in, world, war, ii, he, was, a, researcher, at, bell, labs, and, a, professor, at, the, university, of, illinois, in, 1990, bardeen, appeared, on, life, magazine, s, list, of, 100, most, influential, americans, of, the, century, bardeen, is, the, first, of, only, three, people, to, have, won, multiple, nobel, prizes, in, the, same, category, the, others, being, frederick, sanger, and, karl, barry, sharpless, in, chemistry, and, one, of, five, persons, with, two, nobel, prizes, bardeen, was, born, in, madison, wisconsin, on, may, 23, 1908, he, was, the, son, of, charles, bardeen, the, first, dean, of, the, university, of, wisconsin, medical, school, bardeen, attended, university, of, wisconsin, high, school, in, madison, he, graduated, from, the, school, in, 1923, at, age, 15, he, could, have, graduated, several, years, earlier, but, this, was, postponed, because, he, took, courses, at, another, high, school, and, because, of, his, mother, s, death, bardeen, entered, the, university, of, wisconsin, in, 1923, while, in, college, he, joined, the, zeta, psi, fraternity, he, raised, a, part, of, the, needed, membership, fees, by, playing, billiards, bardeen, was, initiated, as, a, member, of, tau, beta, pi, engineering, honor, society, not, wanting, to, be, an, academic, like, his, father, bardeen, chose, engineering, he, also, felt, that, engineering, had, good, job, prospects, bardeen, received, his, bachelor, of, science, degree, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1928, from, the, university, of, wisconsin, despite, taking, a, year, off, to, work, in, chicago, he, graduated, in, 1928, taking, all, the, graduate, courses, in, physics, and, mathematics, that, had, interested, him, bardeen, graduated, in, five, years, instead, of, the, usual, four, this, allowed, him, time, to, complete, his, master, s, thesis, supervised, by, leo, j, peters, he, received, his, master, of, science, degree, in, electrical, engineering, in, 1929, from, wisconsin, bardeen, furthered, his, studies, by, staying, on, at, wisconsin, but, he, eventually, went, to, work, for, gulf, research, laboratories, the, research, arm, of, the, gulf, oil, corporation, that, was, based, in, pittsburgh, from, 1930, to, 1933, bardeen, worked, there, on, the, development, of, methods, for, the, interpretation, of, magnetic, and, gravitational, surveys, he, worked, as, a, geophysicist, after, the, work, failed, to, keep, his, interest, he, applied, and, was, accepted, to, the, graduate, program, in, mathematics, at, princeton, university, as, a, graduate, student, bardeen, studied, mathematics, and, physics, under, physicist, eugene, wigner, he, wrote, his, thesis, on, a, problem, in, solid, state, physics, before, completing, his, thesis, he, was, offered, a, position, as, junior, fellow, of, the, society, of, fellows, at, harvard, university, in, 1935, he, spent, the, next, three, years, there, from, 1935, to, 1938, working, with, to, be, nobel, laureates, in, physics, john, hasbrouck, van, vleck, and, percy, williams, bridgman, on, problems, in, cohesion, and, electrical, conduction, in, metals, and, also, did, some, work, on, level, density, of, nuclei, he, received, his, ph, d, in, mathematical, physics, from, princeton, in, 1936, from, 1941, to, 1944, bardeen, headed, the, group, working, on, magnetic, mines, and, torpedoes, and, mine, and, torpedo, countermeasures, at, the, naval, ordnance, laboratory, during, this, period, his, wife, jane, gave, birth, to, a, son, bill, born, in, 1941, and, a, daughter, betsy, born, in, 1944, in, october, 1945, bardeen, began, work, at, bell, labs, as, a, member, of, a, solid, state, physics, group, led, by, william, shockley, and, chemist, stanley, morgan, other, personnel, working, in, the, group, were, walter, brattain, physicist, gerald, pearson, chemist, robert, gibney, electronics, expert, hilbert, moore, and, several, technicians, he, moved, his, family, to, summit, new, jersey, the, assignment, of, the, group, was, to, seek, a, solid, state, alternative, to, fragile, glass, vacuum, tube, amplifiers, their, first, attempts, were, based, on, shockley, s, ideas, about, using, an, external, electrical, field, on, a, semiconductor, to, affect, its, conductivity, these, experiments, mysteriously, failed, every, time, in, all, sorts, of, configurations, and, materials, the, group, was, at, a, standstill, until, bardeen, suggested, a, theory, that, invoked, surface, states, that, prevented, the, field, from, penetrating, the, semiconductor, the, group, changed, its, focus, to, study, these, surface, states, meeting, almost, daily, to, discuss, the, work, the, rapport, of, the, group, was, excellent, and, ideas, were, freely, exchanged, by, the, winter, of, 1946, they, had, enough, results, that, bardeen, submitted, a, paper, on, the, surface, states, to, physical, review, brattain, started, experiments, to, study, the, surface, states, through, observations, made, while, shining, a, bright, light, on, the, semiconductor, s, surface, this, led, to, several, more, papers, one, of, them, co, authored, with, shockley, which, estimated, the, density, of, the, surface, states, to, be, more, than, enough, to, account, for, their, failed, experiments, the, pace, of, the, work, picked, up, significantly, when, they, started, to, surround, point, contacts, between, the, semiconductor, and, the, conducting, wires, with, electrolytes, moore, built, a, circuit, that, allowed, them, to, vary, the, frequency, of, the, input, signal, easily, and, suggested, that, they, use, glycol, borate, gu, a, viscous, chemical, that, did, not, evaporate, finally, they, began, to, get, some, evidence, of, power, amplification, when, pearson, acting, on, a, suggestion, by, shockley, put, a, voltage, on, a, droplet, of, gu, placed, across, a, p, n, junction, on, december, 23, 1947, bardeen, and, brattain, were, working, without, shockley, when, they, succeeded, in, creating, a, point, contact, transistor, that, achieved, amplification, by, the, next, month, bell, labs, patent, attorneys, started, to, work, on, the, patent, applications, bell, labs, attorneys, soon, discovered, that, shockley, s, field, effect, principle, had, been, anticipated, and, patented, in, 1930, by, julius, lilienfeld, who, filed, his, mesfet, like, patent, in, canada, on, october, 22, 1925, shockley, publicly, took, the, lion, s, share, of, the, credit, for, the, invention, of, the, transistor, this, led, to, a, deterioration, of, bardeen, s, relationship, with, him, bell, labs, management, however, consistently, presented, all, three, inventors, as, a, team, shockley, eventually, infuriated, and, alienated, bardeen, and, brattain, essentially, blocking, the, two, from, working, on, the, junction, transistor, bardeen, began, pursuing, a, theory, for, superconductivity, and, left, bell, labs, in, 1951, brattain, refused, to, work, with, shockley, further, and, was, assigned, to, another, group, neither, bardeen, nor, brattain, had, much, to, do, with, the, development, of, the, transistor, beyond, the, first, year, after, its, invention, the, transistor, a, portmanteau, of, transconductance, and, resistor, was, 1, 50, the, size, of, the, vacuum, tubes, it, replaced, in, televisions, and, radios, used, far, less, power, was, far, more, reliable, and, it, allowed, electrical, devices, to, become, more, compact, by, 1951, bardeen, was, looking, for, a, new, job, fred, seitz, a, friend, of, bardeen, convinced, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, to, make, bardeen, an, offer, of, 10, 000, a, year, bardeen, accepted, the, offer, and, left, bell, labs, joining, the, engineering, and, physics, faculties, at, illinois, in, 1951, where, he, was, professor, of, electrical, engineering, and, of, physics, at, illinois, he, established, two, major, research, programs, one, in, the, electrical, engineering, department, and, one, in, the, physics, department, the, research, program, in, the, electrical, engineering, department, dealt, with, both, experimental, and, theoretical, aspects, of, semiconductors, and, the, research, program, in, the, physics, department, dealt, with, theoretical, aspects, of, macroscopic, quantum, systems, particularly, superconductivity, and, quantum, liquids, he, was, an, active, professor, at, illinois, from, 1951, to, 1975, and, then, became, professor, emeritus, in, his, later, life, bardeen, remained, active, in, academic, research, during, which, time, he, focused, on, understanding, the, flow, of, electrons, in, charge, density, waves, cdws, through, metallic, linear, chain, compounds, his, proposals, that, cdw, electron, transport, is, a, collective, quantum, phenomenon, see, macroscopic, quantum, phenomena, were, initially, greeted, with, skepticism, however, experiments, reported, in, 2012, show, oscillations, in, cdw, current, versus, magnetic, flux, through, tantalum, trisulfide, rings, similar, to, the, behavior, of, superconducting, quantum, interference, devices, see, squid, and, aharonov, bohm, effect, lending, credence, to, the, idea, that, collective, cdw, electron, transport, is, fundamentally, quantum, in, nature, see, quantum, mechanics, bardeen, continued, his, research, throughout, the, 1980s, and, published, articles, in, physical, review, letters, and, physics, today, less, than, a, year, before, he, died, a, collection, of, bardeen, s, personal, papers, are, held, by, the, university, of, illinois, archives, in, 1956, john, bardeen, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, william, shockley, of, semiconductor, laboratory, of, beckman, instruments, and, walter, brattain, of, bell, telephone, laboratories, for, their, researches, on, semiconductors, and, their, discovery, of, the, transistor, effect, at, the, nobel, prize, ceremony, in, stockholm, brattain, and, shockley, received, their, awards, that, night, from, king, gustaf, vi, adolf, bardeen, brought, only, one, of, his, three, children, to, the, nobel, prize, ceremony, king, gustav, chided, bardeen, because, of, this, and, bardeen, assured, the, king, that, the, next, time, he, would, bring, all, his, children, to, the, ceremony, he, kept, his, promise, in, 1957, bardeen, in, collaboration, with, leon, cooper, and, his, doctoral, student, john, robert, schrieffer, proposed, the, standard, theory, of, superconductivity, known, as, the, bcs, theory, named, for, their, initials, bardeen, became, interested, in, superconducting, tunnelling, in, the, summer, of, 1960, after, consulting, for, the, general, electric, research, laboratory, in, schenectady, new, york, where, he, learned, about, experiments, done, by, ivar, giaever, at, the, rensselaer, polytechnic, institute, which, suggested, that, electrons, from, a, normal, material, could, tunnel, into, a, superconducting, one, 222, 223, in, june, 8, 1962, brian, josephson, then, 23, submitted, to, physics, letters, his, prediction, of, a, super, current, flow, across, a, barrier, effect, which, later, became, known, as, the, josephson, effect, bardeen, challenged, josephson, s, theory, on, a, note, in, his, own, paper, received, ten, days, later, by, physical, review, letters, 222, 225, in, a, recent, note, josephson, uses, a, somewhat, similar, formulation, to, discuss, the, possibility, of, superfluid, flow, across, the, tunneling, region, in, which, no, quasi, particles, are, created, however, as, pointed, out, by, the, author, reference, 3, pairing, does, not, extend, into, the, barrier, so, that, there, can, be, no, such, superfluid, flow, the, matter, was, further, discussed, on, the, 8th, international, conference, on, low, temperature, physics, held, september, 16, to, 22, 1962, at, queen, mary, university, of, london, while, josephson, was, presenting, his, theory, bardeen, rose, to, describe, his, objections, after, an, intense, debate, both, men, were, unable, to, reach, a, common, understanding, and, at, points, josephson, repeatedly, asked, bardeen, did, you, calculate, it, no, i, did, 225, 226, in, 1963, experimental, evidence, and, further, theoretical, clarifications, were, discovered, supporting, the, josephson, effect, notably, in, a, paper, by, philip, w, anderson, and, john, rowell, from, bell, labs, after, this, bardeen, came, to, accept, josephson, s, theory, and, publicly, withdrew, his, previous, opposition, to, it, at, a, conference, held, in, august, 1963, bardeen, also, invited, josephson, as, a, postdoc, in, illinois, for, the, academic, year, of, 1965, 1966, and, later, nominated, josephson, and, giaever, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, which, they, received, in, 1973, 226, in, 1972, bardeen, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, leon, n, cooper, of, brown, university, and, john, robert, schrieffer, of, the, university, of, pennsylvania, for, their, jointly, developed, theory, of, superconductivity, usually, called, the, bcs, theory, this, was, bardeen, s, second, nobel, prize, in, physics, he, became, the, first, person, to, win, two, nobel, prizes, in, the, same, field, bardeen, brought, his, three, children, to, the, nobel, prize, ceremony, in, stockholm, bardeen, gave, much, of, his, nobel, prize, money, to, fund, the, fritz, london, memorial, lectures, at, duke, university, in, the, late, 1960s, bardeen, felt, that, cooper, and, schrieffer, deserved, the, nobel, prize, for, bcs, he, was, concerned, that, they, might, not, be, awarded, because, of, the, nobel, committee, s, reticence, to, award, the, same, person, twice, which, would, be, his, case, as, a, co, author, of, the, theory, bardeen, nominated, scientists, who, worked, on, superconducting, tunneling, effects, such, as, the, josephson, effect, for, the, prize, in, 1967, leo, esaki, ivar, giaever, and, brian, josephson, he, recognized, that, because, the, tunneling, developments, depended, on, superconductivity, it, would, increase, the, chances, that, bcs, itself, would, be, awarded, first, he, also, reasoned, that, the, nobel, committee, had, a, predilection, for, multinational, teams, which, was, the, case, for, his, tunneling, nominees, each, being, from, a, different, country, bardeen, renewed, the, nominations, in, 1971, 1972, when, bcs, received, the, prize, and, finally, 1973, when, tunneling, was, awarded, 230, 231, he, is, the, only, double, laureate, in, physics, and, one, of, three, double, laureates, of, the, same, prize, the, others, are, frederick, sanger, who, won, the, 1958, and, 1980, prizes, in, chemistry, and, karl, barry, sharpless, who, won, the, 2001, and, 2022, prizes, in, chemistry, in, addition, to, being, awarded, the, nobel, prize, twice, bardeen, has, numerous, other, awards, including, bardeen, was, also, an, important, adviser, to, xerox, corporation, though, quiet, by, nature, he, took, the, uncharacteristic, step, of, urging, xerox, executives, to, keep, their, california, research, center, xerox, parc, afloat, when, the, parent, company, was, suspicious, that, its, research, center, would, amount, to, little, bardeen, married, jane, maxwell, on, july, 18, 1938, while, at, princeton, he, met, jane, during, a, visit, to, his, old, friends, in, pittsburgh, bardeen, was, a, scientist, with, a, very, unassuming, personality, while, he, served, as, a, professor, for, almost, 40, years, at, the, university, of, illinois, he, was, best, remembered, by, neighbors, for, hosting, cookouts, where, he, would, prepare, food, for, his, friends, many, of, whom, were, unaware, of, his, accomplishments, at, the, university, he, would, always, ask, his, guests, if, they, liked, the, hamburger, bun, toasted, since, he, liked, his, that, way, he, enjoyed, playing, golf, and, going, on, picnics, with, his, family, lillian, hoddeson, said, that, because, he, differed, radically, from, the, popular, stereotype, of, genius, and, was, uninterested, in, appearing, other, than, ordinary, the, public, and, the, media, often, overlooked, him, when, bardeen, was, asked, about, his, beliefs, during, a, 1988, interview, he, responded, i, am, not, a, religious, person, and, so, do, not, think, about, it, very, much, however, he, has, also, said, i, feel, that, science, cannot, provide, an, answer, to, the, ultimate, questions, about, the, meaning, and, purpose, of, life, bardeen, did, believe, in, a, code, of, moral, values, and, behavior, john, bardeen, s, children, were, taken, to, church, by, his, wife, who, taught, sunday, school, and, was, a, church, elder, 168, 169, despite, this, he, and, his, wife, made, it, clear, that, they, did, not, have, faith, in, an, afterlife, and, other, religious, ideas, he, was, the, father, of, james, m, bardeen, william, a, bardeen, and, daughter, elizabeth, bardeen, died, of, heart, disease, at, age, 82, at, brigham, and, women, s, hospital, in, boston, massachusetts, on, january, 30, 1991, although, he, lived, in, champaign, urbana, he, had, come, to, boston, for, medical, consultation, bardeen, and, his, wife, jane, 1907, 1997, are, buried, in, forest, hill, cemetery, madison, wisconsin, they, were, survived, by, three, children, james, william, and, elizabeth, bardeen, greytak, and, six, grandchildren, near, the, end, of, this, decade, when, they, begin, enumerating, the, names, of, the, people, who, had, the, greatest, impact, on, the, 20th, century, the, name, of, john, bardeen, who, died, last, week, has, to, be, near, or, perhaps, even, arguably, at, the, top, of, the, list, mr, bardeen, shared, two, nobel, prizes, and, has, been, awarded, numerous, other, honors, but, what, greater, honor, can, there, be, when, each, of, us, can, look, all, around, us, and, everywhere, see, the, reminders, of, a, man, whose, genius, has, made, our, lives, longer, healthier, and, better, chicago, tribune, editorial, february, 3, 1991, in, honor, of, bardeen, the, engineering, quadrangle, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, is, named, the, bardeen, quad, also, in, honor, of, bardeen, sony, corporation, endowed, a, 3, million, john, bardeen, professorial, chair, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, beginning, in, 1990, sony, corporation, owed, much, of, its, success, to, commercializing, bardeen, s, transistors, in, portable, tvs, and, radios, and, had, worked, with, illinois, researchers, as, of, 2022, the, john, bardeen, professor, is, yurii, vlasov, at, the, time, of, bardeen, s, death, then, university, of, illinois, chancellor, morton, weir, said, it, is, a, rare, person, whose, work, changes, the, life, of, every, american, john, s, did, bardeen, was, honored, on, a, march, 6, 2008, united, states, postage, stamp, as, part, of, the, american, scientists, series, designed, by, artist, victor, stabin, the, 0, 41, stamp, was, unveiled, in, a, ceremony, at, the, university, of, illinois, his, citation, reads, theoretical, physicist, john, bardeen, 1908, 1991, shared, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, twice, in, 1956, as, co, inventor, of, the, transistor, and, in, 1972, for, the, explanation, of, superconductivity, the, transistor, paved, the, way, for, all, modern, electronics, from, computers, to, microchips, diverse, applications, of, superconductivity, include, infrared, sensors, and, medical, imaging, systems, the, other, scientists, on, the, american, scientists, sheet, include, biochemist, gerty, cori, chemist, linus, pauling, and, astronomer, edwin,
