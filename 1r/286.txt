a, lawyer, voltaire, pretending, to, work, in, paris, as, an, assistant, to, a, notary, spent, much, of, his, time, writing, poetry, when, his, father, found, out, he, sent, voltaire, to, study, law, this, time, in, caen, normandy, but, the, young, man, continued, to, write, producing, essays, and, historical, studies, voltaire, s, wit, made, him, popular, among, some, of, the, aristocratic,

scandalous, was, discovered, by, de, ch, teauneuf, and, voltaire, was, forced, to, return, to, france, by, the, end, of, the, year, most, of, voltaire, s, early, life, revolved, around, paris, from, early, on, voltaire, had, trouble, with, the, authorities, for, critiques, of, the, government, as, a, result, he, was, twice, sentenced, to, prison, and, once, to, temporary, exile, to, england, one, satirical, verse, in, which, voltaire, accused, the, r, gent, of, incest, with, his, daughter, resulted, in, an, eleven, month, imprisonment, in, the, bastille, the, com, die, fran, aise, had, agreed, in, january, 1717, to, stage, his, debut, play, dipe, and, it, opened, in, mid, november, 1718, seven, months, after, his, release, its, immediate, critical, and, financial, success, established, his, reputation, both, the, r, gent, and, king, george, i, of, great, britain, presented, voltaire, with, medals, as, a, mark, of, their, appreciation, voltaire, mainly, argued, for, religious, tolerance, and, freedom, of, thought, he, campaigned, to, eradicate, priestly, and, aristo, monarchical, authority, and, supported, a, constitutional, monarchy, that, protects, people, s, rights, arouet, adopted, the, name, voltaire, in, 1718, following, his, incarceration, at, the, bastille, its, origin, is, unclear, it, is, an, anagram, of, arovet, li, the, latinized, spelling, of, his, surname, arouet, and, the, initial, letters, of, le, jeune, the, young, according, to, a, family, tradition, among, the, descendants, of, his, sister, he, was, known, as, le, petit, volontaire, determined, little, thing, as, a, child, and, he, resurrected, a, variant, of, the, name, in, his, adult, life, the, name, also, reverses, the, syllables, of, airvault, his, family, s, home, town, in, the, poitou, region, richard, holmes, supports, the, anagrammatic, derivation, of, the, name, but, adds, that, a, writer, such, as, voltaire, would, have, intended, it, to, also, convey, connotations, of, speed, and, daring, these, come, from, associations, with, words, such, as, voltige, acrobatics, on, a, trapeze, or, horse, volte, face, a, spinning, about, to, face, one, s, enemies, and, volatile, originally, any, winged, creature, arouet, was, not, a, noble, name, fit, for, his, growing, reputation, especially, given, that, name, s, resonance, with, rouer, to, be, beaten, up, and, rou, a, d, bauch, in, a, letter, to, jean, baptiste, rousseau, in, march, 1719, voltaire, concludes, by, asking, that, if, rousseau, wishes, to, send, him, a, return, letter, he, do, so, by, addressing, it, to, monsieur, de, voltaire, a, postscript, explains, j, ai, t, si, malheureux, sous, le, nom, d, arouet, que, j, en, ai, pris, un, autre, surtout, pour, n, tre, plus, confondu, avec, le, po, te, roi, i, was, so, unhappy, under, the, name, of, arouet, that, i, have, taken, another, primarily, so, as, to, cease, to, be, confused, with, the, poet, roi, this, probably, refers, to, adenes, le, roi, and, the, oi, diphthong, was, then, pronounced, like, modern, ouai, so, the, similarity, to, arouet, is, clear, and, thus, it, could, well, have, been, part, of, his, rationale, voltaire, is, known, also, to, have, used, at, least, 178, separate, pen, names, during, his, lifetime, voltaire, s, next, play, art, mire, set, in, ancient, macedonia, opened, on, 15, february, 1720, it, was, a, flop, and,

voltaire, was, struck, and, impressed, by, the, openness, and, tolerance, of, dutch, society, on, his, return, to, france, he, secured, a, second, publisher, in, rouen, who, agreed, to, publish, la, henriade, clandestinely, after, voltaire, s, recovery, from, a, month, long, smallpox, infection, in, november, 1723, the, first, copies, were, smuggled, into, paris, and, distributed, while, the, poem, was, an, instant, success, voltaire, s, new, play, mariamne, was, a, failure, when, it, first, opened, in, march, 1724, heavily, reworked, it, opened, at, the, com, die, fran, aise, in, april,

constitutional, monarchy, in, contrast, to, french, absolutism, and, by, the, country, s, greater, freedom, of, speech, and, religion, he, was, influenced, by, the, writers, of, the, time, and, developed, an, interest, in, english, literature, especially, shakespeare, who, was, still, little, known, in, continental, europe, despite, pointing, out, shakespeare, s, deviations, from, neoclassical, standards, voltaire, saw, him, as, an, example, for, french, drama, which, though, more, polished, lacked, on, stage, action, later, however, as, shakespeare, s, influence, began, growing, in, france, voltaire, tried, to, set, a, contrary, example, with, his, own, plays, decrying, what, he, considered, shakespeare, s, barbarities, voltaire, may, have, been, present, at, the,

him, to, take, control, of, a, trust, fund, inherited, from, his, father, he, was, now, indisputably, rich, further, success, followed, in, 1732, with, his, play, za, re, which, when, published, in,

concerning, the, english, nation, london, 1733, in, 1734, they, were, published, in, rouen, as, lettres, philosophiques, causing, a, huge, scandal, published, without, approval, of, the, royal,

at, the, ch, teau, with, his, wife, and, her, lover, the, intellectual, paramours, collected, around, 21, 000, books, an, enormous, number, for, the, time, together, they, studied, these, books, and, performed, scientific, experiments, at, cirey, including, an, attempt, to, determine, the, nature, of, fire, having, learned, from, his, previous, brushes, with, the, authorities, voltaire, began, his, habit, of, avoiding, open, confrontation, with, the, authorities, and, denying, any, awkward, responsibility, he, continued, to, write, plays, such, as, m, rope, or, la, m, rope, fran, aise, and, began, his, long, researches, into, science, and, history, again, a, main, source, of, inspiration, for, voltaire, were, the, years, of, his, british, exile, during, which, he, had, been, strongly, influenced, by, newton, s, works, voltaire, strongly, believed, in, newton, s, theories, he, performed, experiments, in, optics, at, cirey, and, was, one, of, the, promulgators, of, the, famous,

french, which, remained, the, definitive, french, version, into, the, 21st, century, both, she, and, voltaire, were, also, curious, about, the, philosophy, of, gottfried, leibniz, a, contemporary, and, rival, of, newton, while, voltaire, remained, a, firm, newtonian, the, marquise, adopted, certain, aspects, of, leibniz, s, critiques, voltaire, s, own, book, elements, of, the, philosophy, of, newton, made, the, great, scientist, accessible, to, a, far, greater, public, and, the, marquise, wrote, a, celebratory, review, in, the, journal, des, savants, voltaire, s, work, was, instrumental, in, bringing, about, general, acceptance, of, newton, s, optical, and, gravitational, theories, in, france, in, contrast, to, the, theories, of, descartes, voltaire, and, the, marquise, also, studied, history, particularly, the, great, contributors, to, civilization, voltaire, s, second, essay, in, english, had, been, essay, upon, the, civil, wars, in, france, it, was, followed, by, la, henriade, an, epic, poem, on, the, french, king, henri, iv, glorifying, his, attempt, to, end, the, catholic, protestant, massacres, with, the, edict, of, nantes, which, established, religious, toleration, there, followed, a, historical, novel, on, king, charles, xii, of, sweden, these, along, with, his, letters, on, the, english, mark, the, beginning, of, voltaire, s, open, criticism, of, intolerance, and, established, religions, voltaire, and, the, marquise, also, explored, philosophy, particularly, metaphysical, questions, concerning, the, existence, of, god, and, the, soul, voltaire, and, the, marquise, analyzed, the, bible, and, concluded, that, much, of, its, content, was, dubious, voltaire, s, critical, views, on, religion, led, to, his, belief, in, separation, of, church, and, state, and, religious, freedom, ideas, that, he, had, formed, after, his, stay, in, england, in, august, 1736, frederick, the, great, then, crown, prince, of, prussia, and, a, great, admirer, of, voltaire, initiated, a, correspondence, with, him, that, december, voltaire, moved, to, holland, for, two, months, and, became, acquainted, with, the, scientists, herman, boerhaave, and, willem, s, gravesande, from, mid, 1739, to, mid, 1740, voltaire, lived, largely, in, brussels, at, first, with, the, marquise, who, was, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, pursue, a, 60, year, old, family, legal, case, regarding, the, ownership, of, two, estates, in, limburg, in, july, 1740, he, traveled, to, the, hague, on, behalf, of, frederick, in, an, attempt, to, dissuade, a, dubious, publisher, van, duren,

by, the, french, government, as, an, envoy, and, spy, to, gauge, frederick, s, military, intentions, in, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, though, deeply, committed, to, the, marquise, voltaire, by, 1744, found, life, at, her, ch, teau, confining, on, a, visit, to, paris, that, year, he, found, a, new, love, his, niece, at, first, his, attraction, to, marie, louise, mignot, was, clearly, sexual, as, evidenced, by, his, letters, to, her, only, discovered, in, 1957, much, later, they, lived, together, perhaps, platonically, and, remained, together, until, voltaire, s, death, meanwhile, the, marquise, also, took, a, lover, the, marquis, de, saint, lambert, after, the, death, of, the, marquise, in, childbirth, in, september, 1749, voltaire, briefly, returned, to, paris,

at, first, and, in, 1751, he, completed, microm, gas, a, piece, of, science, fiction, involving, ambassadors, from, another, planet, witnessing, the, follies, of, humankind, however, his, relationship, with, frederick, began, to, deteriorate, after, he, was, accused, of, theft, and, forgery, by, a, jewish, financier, abraham, hirschel, who, had, invested, in, saxon, government, bonds, on, behalf, of, voltaire, at, a, time, when, frederick, was, involved, in, sensitive, diplomatic, negotiations, with, saxony, he, encountered, other, difficulties, an, argument, with, maupertuis, the, president, of, the, berlin, academy, of, science, and, a, former, rival, for, milie, s, affections, provoked, voltaire, s, diatribe, du, docteur, akakia, diatribe, of, doctor, akakia, which, satirized, some, of, maupertuis, s, theories, and, his, persecutions, of, a, mutual, acquaintance, johann, samuel, k, nig, this, greatly, angered, frederick, who, ordered, all, copies, of, the, document, burned, on, 1, january, 1752, voltaire, offered, to, resign, as, chamberlain, and, return, his, insignia, of, the, order, of, merit, at, first, frederick, refused, until, eventually, permitting, voltaire, to, leave, in, march, on, a, slow, journey, back, to, france, voltaire, stayed, at, leipzig, and, gotha, for, a, month, each, and, kassel, for, two, weeks, arriving, at, frankfurt, on, 31, may, the, following, morning, he, was, detained, at, an, inn, by, frederick, s, agents, who, held, him, in, the, city, for, over, three, weeks, while, voltaire, and, frederick, argued, by, letter, over, the, return, of, a, satirical, book, of, poetry, frederick, had, lent, to, voltaire, marie, louise, joined, him, on, 9, june, she, and, her, uncle, only, left, frankfurt, in, july, after, she, had, defended, herself, from, the, unwanted, advances, of, one, of, frederick, s, agents, and, voltaire, s, luggage, had, been, ransacked, and, valuable, items, taken, voltaire, s, attempts, to, vilify, frederick, for, his, agents, actions, at, frankfurt, were, largely, unsuccessful, including, his, m, moires, pour, servir, la, vie, de, m, de, voltaire, published, posthumously, in, which, he, also, explicitly, made, mention, of, frederick, s, homosexuality, when, he, described, how, the, king, regularly, invited, pages, young, cadets, or, lieutenants, from, his, regiment, to, have, coffee, with, him, and, then, withdrew, with, the, favourite, for, a, quickie, however, the, correspondence, between, them, continued, and, though, they, never, met, in, person, again, after, the, seven, years, war, they, largely, reconciled, voltaire, s, slow, progress, toward, paris, continued, through, mainz, mannheim, strasbourg, and, colmar, but, in, january, 1754, louis, xv, banned, him, from, paris, and, he, turned, for, geneva, near, which, he, bought, a, large, estate, les, d, lices, in, early, 1755, though, he, was, received, openly, at, first, the, law, in, geneva, which, banned, theatrical, performances, and, the, publication, of, the, maid, of, orleans, against, his, will, soured, his, relationship, with, calvinist, genevans, in, late, 1758, he, bought, an, even, larger, estate, at, ferney, on, the, french, side, of, the, franco, swiss, border, the, town, would, adopt, his, name, calling, itself, ferney, voltaire, and, this, became, its, official, name, in, 1878, early, in, 1759, voltaire, completed, and, published, candide, ou, l, optimisme, candide, or, optimism, this, satire, on, leibniz, s, philosophy, of, optimistic, determinism, remains, voltaire, s, best, known, work, he, would, stay, in, ferney, for, most, of, the, remaining, 20, years, of, his, life, frequently, entertaining, distinguished, guests, such, as, james, boswell, who, recorded, their, conversations, in, his, journal, and, memoranda, adam, smith, giacomo, casanova, and, edward, gibbon, in, 1764, he, published, one, of, his, best, known, philosophical, works, the, dictionnaire, philosophique, a, series, of, articles, mainly, on, christian, history, and, dogmas, a, few, of, which, were, originally, written, in, berlin, from, 1762, as, an, unmatched, intellectual, celebrity, he, began, to, champion, unjustly, persecuted, individuals, most, famously, the, huguenot, merchant, jean, calas, calas, had, been, tortured, to, death, in, 1763, supposedly, because, he, had, murdered, his, eldest, son, for, wanting, to, convert, to, catholicism, his, possessions, were, confiscated, and, his, two, daughters, were, taken, from, his, widow, and, forced, into, catholic, convents, voltaire, seeing, this, as, a, clear, case, of, religious, persecution, managed, to, overturn, the, conviction, in, 1765, voltaire, was, initiated, into, freemasonry, a, little, over, a, month, before, his, death, on, 4, april, 1778, he, attended, la, loge, des, neuf, s, urs, in, paris, and, became, an, entered, apprentice, freemason, according, to, some, sources, benjamin, franklin, urged, voltaire, to, become, a, freemason, and, voltaire, agreed, perhaps, only, to, please, franklin, however, franklin, was, merely, a, visitor, at, the, time, voltaire, was, initiated, the, two, only, met, a, month, before, voltaire, s, death, and, their, interactions, with, each, other, were, brief, in, february, 1778, voltaire, returned, to, paris, for, the, first, time, in, over, 25, years, partly, to, see, the, opening, of, his, latest, tragedy, irene, the, five, day, journey, was, too, much, for, the, 83, year, old, and, he, believed, he, was, about, to, die, on, 28, february, writing, i, die, adoring, god, loving, my, friends, not, hating, my, enemies, and, detesting, superstition, however, he, recovered, and, in, march, he, saw, a, performance, of, irene, where, he, was, treated, by, the, audience, as, a, returning, hero, he, soon, became, ill, again, and, died, on, 30, may, 1778, the, accounts, of, his, deathbed, have, been, numerous, and, varying, and, it, has, not, been, possible, to, establish, the, details, of, what, precisely, occurred, his, enemies, related, that, he, repented, and, accepted, the, last, rites, from, a, catholic, priest, or, that, he, died, in, agony, of, body, and, soul, while, his, adherents, told, of, his, defiance, to, his, last, breath, according, to, one, story, of, his, last, words, when, the, priest, urged, him, to, renounce, satan, he, replied, this, is, no, time, to, make, new, enemies, because, of, his, well, known, criticism, of, the, church, which, he, had, refused, to, retract, before, his, death, voltaire, was, denied, a, christian, burial, in, paris, but, friends, and, relations, managed, to, bury, his, body, secretly, at, the, abbey, of, scelli, res, in, champagne, where, marie, louise, s, brother, was, abb, his, heart, and, brain, were, embalmed, separately, on, 11, july, 1791, the, national, assembly, of, france, regarding, voltaire, as, a, forerunner, of, the, french, revolution, had, his, remains, brought, back, to, paris, and, enshrined, in, the, panth, on, an, estimated, million, people, attended, the, procession, which, stretched, throughout, paris, there, was, an, elaborate, ceremony, including, music, composed, for, the, event, by, andr, gr, try, voltaire, had, an, enormous, influence, on, the, development, of, historiography, through, his, demonstration, of, fresh, new, ways, to, look, at, the, past, guillaume, de, syon, argues, voltaire, recast, historiography, in, both, factual, and, analytical, terms, not, only, did, he, reject, traditional, biographies, and, accounts, that, claim, the, work, of, supernatural, forces, but, he, went, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, earlier, historiography, was, rife, with, falsified, evidence, and, required, new, investigations, at, the, source, such, an, outlook, was, not, unique, in, that, the, scientific, spirit, that, 18th, century, intellectuals, perceived, themselves, as, invested, with, a, rationalistic, approach, was, key, to, rewriting, history, voltaire, s, best, known, histories, are, history, of, charles, xii, 1731, the, age, of, louis, xiv, 1751, and, his, essay, on, the, customs, and, the, spirit, of, the, nations, 1756, he, broke, from, the, tradition, of, narrating, diplomatic, and, military, events, and, emphasized, customs, social, history, and, achievements, in, the, arts, and, sciences, the, essay, on, customs, traced, the, progress, of, world, civilization, in, a, universal, context, rejecting, both, nationalism, and, the, traditional, christian, frame, of, reference, influenced, by, bossuet, s, discourse, on, universal, history, 1682, he, was, the, first, scholar, to, attempt, seriously, a, history, of, the, world, eliminating, theological, frameworks, and, emphasizing, economics, culture, and, political, history, he, treated, europe, as, a, whole, rather, than, a, collection, of, nations, he, was, the, first, to, emphasize, the, debt, of, medieval, culture, to, middle, eastern, civilization, but, otherwise, was, weak, on, the, middle, ages, although, he, repeatedly, warned, against, political, bias, on, the, part, of, the, historian, he, did, not, miss, many, opportunities, to, expose, the, intolerance, and, frauds, of, the, church, over, the, ages, voltaire, advised, scholars, that, anything, contradicting, the, normal, course, of, nature, was, not, to, be, believed, although, he, found, evil, in, the, historical, record, he, fervently, believed, reason, and, expanding, literacy, would, lead, to, progress, voltaire, explains, his, view, of, historiography, in, his, article, on, history, in, diderot, s, encyclop, die, one, demands, of, modern, historians, more, details, better, ascertained, facts, precise, dates, more, attention, to, customs, laws, mores, commerce, finance, agriculture, population, voltaire, s, histories, imposed, the, values, of, the, enlightenment, on, the, past, but, at, the, same, time, he, helped, free, historiography, from, antiquarianism, eurocentrism, religious, intolerance, and, a, concentration, on, great, men, diplomacy, and, warfare, yale, professor, peter, gay, says, voltaire, wrote, very, good, history, citing, his, scrupulous, concern, for, truths, careful, sifting, of, evidence, intelligent, selection, of, what, is, important, keen, sense, of, drama, and, grasp, of, the, fact, that, a, whole, civilization, is, a, unit, of, study, from, an, early, age, voltaire, displayed, a, talent, for, writing, verse, and, his, first, published, work, was, poetry, he, wrote, two, book, long, epic, poems, including, the, first, ever, written, in, french, the, henriade, and, later, the, maid, of, orleans, besides, many, other, smaller, pieces, the, henriade, was, written, in, imitation, of, virgil, using, the, alexandrine, couplet, reformed, and, rendered, monotonous, for, modern, readers, but, it, was, a, huge, success, in, the, 18th, and, early, 19th, century, with, sixty, five, editions, and, translations, into, several, languages, the, epic, poem, transformed, french, king, henry, iv, into, a, national, hero, for, his, attempts, at, instituting, tolerance, with, his, edict, of, nantes, la, pucelle, on, the, other, hand, is, a, burlesque, on, the, legend, of, joan, of, arc, many, of, voltaire, s, prose, works, and, romances, usually, composed, as, pamphlets, were, written, as, polemics, candide, attacks, the, passivity, inspired, by, leibniz, s, philosophy, of, optimism, through, the, character, pangloss, s, frequent, refrain, that, because, god, created, it, this, is, of, necessity, the, best, of, all, possible, worlds, l, homme, aux, quarante, ecus, the, man, of, forty, pieces, of, silver, addresses, social, and, political, ways, of, the, time, zadig, and, others, the, received, forms, of, moral, and, metaphysical, orthodoxy, and, some, were, written, to, deride, the, bible, in, these, works, voltaire, s, ironic, style, free, of, exaggeration, is, apparent, particularly, the, restraint, and, simplicity, of, the, verbal, treatment, candide, in, particular, is, the, best, example, of, his, style, voltaire, also, has, in, common, with, jonathan, swift, the, distinction, of, paving, the, way, for, science, fiction, s, philosophical, irony, particularly, in, his, microm, gas, and, the, vignette, plato, s, dream, 1756, in, general, his, criticism, and, miscellaneous, writing, show, a, similar, style, to, voltaire, s, other, works, almost, all, of, his, more, substantive, works, whether, in, verse, or, prose, are, preceded, by, prefaces, of, one, sort, or, another, which, are, models, of, his, caustic, yet, conversational, tone, in, a, vast, variety, of, nondescript, pamphlets, and, writings, he, displays, his, skills, at, journalism, in, pure, literary, criticism, his, principal, work, is, the, commentaire, sur, corneille, although, he, wrote, many, more, similar, works, sometimes, as, in, his, life, and, notices, of, moli, re, independently, and, sometimes, as, part, of, his, si, cles, voltaire, s, works, especially, his, private, letters, frequently, urge, the, reader, crasez, l, inf, me, or, crush, the, infamous, the, phrase, refers, to, contemporaneous, abuses, of, power, by, royal, and, religious, authorities, and, the, superstition, and, intolerance, fomented, by, the, clergy, he, had, seen, and, felt, these, effects, in, his, own, exiles, the, burnings, of, his, books, and, those, of, many, others, and, in, the, atrocious, persecution, of, jean, calas, and, fran, ois, jean, de, la, barre, he, stated, in, one, of, his, most, famous, quotes, that, superstition, sets, the, whole, world, in, flames, philosophy, quenches, them, la, superstition, met, le, monde, entier, en, flammes, la, philosophie, les, teint, the, most, oft, cited, voltaire, quotation, is, apocryphal, he, is, incorrectly, credited, with, writing, i, disapprove, of, what, you, say, but, i, will, defend, to, the, death, your, right, to, say, it, these, were, not, his, words, but, rather, those, of, evelyn, beatrice, hall, written, under, the, pseudonym, s, g, tallentyre, in, her, 1906, biographical, book, the, friends, of, voltaire, hall, intended, to, summarize, in, her, own, words, voltaire, s, attitude, towards, claude, adrien, helv, tius, and, his, controversial, book, de, l, esprit, but, her, first, person, expression, was, mistaken, for, an, actual, quotation, from, voltaire, her, interpretation, does, capture, the, spirit, of, voltaire, s, attitude, towards, helv, tius, it, had, been, said, hall, s, summary, was, inspired, by, a, quotation, found, in, a, 1770, voltaire, letter, to, an, abbot, le, riche, in, which, he, was, reported, to, have, said, i, detest, what, you, write, but, i, would, give, my, life, to, make, it, possible, for, you, to, continue, to, write, nevertheless, scholars, believe, there, must, have, again, been, misinterpretation, as, the, letter, does, not, seem, to, contain, any, such, quote, voltaire, s, first, major, philosophical, work, in, his, battle, against, l, inf, me, was, the, trait, sur, la, tol, rance, treatise, on, tolerance, exposing, the, calas, affair, along, with, the, tolerance, exercised, by, other, faiths, and, in, other, eras, for, example, by, the, jews, the, romans, the, greeks, and, the, chinese, then, in, his, dictionnaire, philosophique, containing, such, articles, as, abraham, genesis, church, council, he, wrote, about, what, he, perceived, as, the, human, origins, of, dogmas, and, beliefs, as, well, as, inhuman, behavior, of, religious, and, political, institutions, in, shedding, blood, over, the, quarrels, of, competing, sects, amongst, other, targets, voltaire, criticized, france, s, colonial, policy, in, north, america, dismissing, the, vast, territory, of, new, france, as, a, few, acres, of, snow, quelques, arpents, de, neige, voltaire, also, engaged, in, an, enormous, amount, of, private, correspondence, during, his, life, totalling, over, 20, 000, letters, theodore, besterman, s, collected, edition, of, these, letters, completed, only, in, 1964, fills, 102, volumes, one, historian, called, the, letters, a, feast, not, only, of, wit, and, eloquence, but, of, warm, friendship, humane, feeling, and, incisive, thought, in, voltaire, s, correspondence, with, catherine, the, great, he, derided, democracy, he, wrote, almost, nothing, great, has, ever, been, done, in, the, world, except, by, the, genius, and, firmness, of, a, single, man, combating, the, prejudices, of, the, multitude, like, other, key, enlightenment, thinkers, voltaire, was, a, deist, he, challenged, orthodoxy, by, asking, what, is, faith, is, it, to, believe, that, which, is, evident, no, it, is, perfectly, evident, to, my, mind, that, there, exists, a, necessary, eternal, supreme, and, intelligent, being, this, is, no, matter, of, faith, but, of, reason, in, a, 1763, essay, voltaire, supported, the, toleration, of, other, religions, and, ethnicities, it, does, not, require, great, art, or, magnificently, trained, eloquence, to, prove, that, christians, should, tolerate, each, other, i, however, am, going, further, i, say, that, we, should, regard, all, men, as, our, brothers, what, the, turk, my, brother, the, chinaman, my, brother, the, jew, the, siam, yes, without, doubt, are, we, not, all, children, of, the, same, father, and, creatures, of, the, same, god, in, one, of, his, many, denunciations, of, priests, of, every, religious, sect, voltaire, describes, them, as, those, who, rise, from, an, incestuous, bed, manufacture, a, hundred, versions, of, god, then, eat, and, drink, god, then, piss, and, shit, god, historians, have, described, voltaire, s, description, of, the, history, of, christianity, as, propagandistic, his, dictionnaire, philosophique, is, responsible, for, the, myth, that, the, early, church, had, fifty, gospels, before, settling, on, the, standard, canonical, four, as, well, as, propagating, the, myth, that, the, canon, of, the, new, testament, was, decided, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, voltaire, is, partially, responsible, for, the, misattribution, of, the, expression, credo, quia, absurdum, to, the, church, fathers, furthermore, despite, the, death, of, hypatia, being, the, result, of, finding, herself, in, the, crossfires, of, a, mob, likely, christian, during, a, political, feud, in, 4th, century, alexandria, voltaire, promoted, the, theory, that, she, was, stripped, naked, and, murdered, by, the, minions, of, the, bishop, cyril, of, alexandria, concluding, by, stating, that, when, one, finds, a, beautiful, woman, completely, naked, it, is, not, for, the, purpose, of, massacring, her, voltaire, meant, for, this, argument, to, bolster, one, of, his, anti, catholic, tracts, in, a, letter, to, frederick, the, great, dated, 5, january, 1767, he, wrote, about, christianity, la, n, tre, est, sans, contredit, la, plus, ridicule, la, plus, absurde, et, la, plus, sanguinaire, qui, ait, jamais, infect, le, monde, ours, is, assuredly, the, most, ridiculous, the, most, absurd, and, the, most, bloody, religion, which, has, ever, infected, this, world, your, majesty, will, do, the, human, race, an, eternal, service, by, extirpating, this, infamous, superstition, i, do, not, say, among, the, rabble, who, are, not, worthy, of, being, enlightened, and, who, are, apt, for, every, yoke, i, say, among, honest, people, among, men, who, think, among, those, who, wish, to, think, my, one, regret, in, dying, is, that, i, cannot, aid, you, in, this, noble, enterprise, the, finest, and, most, respectable, which, the, human, mind, can, point, out, in, la, bible, enfin, expliqu, e, he, expressed, the, following, attitude, to, lay, reading, of, the, bible, it, is, characteristic, of, fanatics, who, read, the, holy, scriptures, to, tell, themselves, god, killed, so, i, must, kill, abraham, lied, jacob, deceived, rachel, stole, so, i, must, steal, deceive, lie, but, wretch, you, are, neither, rachel, nor, jacob, nor, abraham, nor, god, you, are, just, a, mad, fool, and, the, popes, who, forbade, the, reading, of, the, bible, were, extremely, wise, voltaire, s, opinion, of, the, bible, was, mixed, although, influenced, by, socinian, works, such, as, the, bibliotheca, fratrum, polonorum, voltaire, s, skeptical, attitude, to, the, bible, separated, him, from, unitarian, theologians, like, fausto, sozzini, or, even, biblical, political, writers, like, john, locke, his, statements, on, religion, also, brought, down, on, him, the, fury, of, the, jesuits, and, in, particular, claude, adrien, nonnotte, this, did, not, hinder, his, religious, practice, though, it, did, win, for, him, a, bad, reputation, in, certain, religious, circles, the, deeply, christian, wolfgang, amadeus, mozart, wrote, to, his, father, the, year, of, voltaire, s, death, saying, the, arch, scoundrel, voltaire, has, finally, kicked, the, bucket, voltaire, was, later, deemed, to, influence, edward, gibbon, in, claiming, that, christianity, was, a, contributor, to, the, fall, of, the, roman, empire, in, his, book, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, as, christianity, advances, disasters, befall, the, empire, arts, science, literature, decay, barbarism, and, all, its, revolting, concomitants, are, made, to, seem, the, consequences, of, its, decisive, triumph, and, the, unwary, reader, is, conducted, with, matchless, dexterity, to, the, desired, conclusion, the, abominable, manicheism, of, candide, and, in, fact, of, all, the, productions, of, voltaire, s, historic, school, viz, that, instead, of, being, a, merciful, ameliorating, and, benignant, visitation, the, religion, of, christians, would, rather, seem, to, be, a, scourge, sent, on, man, by, the, author, of, all, evil, however, voltaire, also, acknowledged, the, self, sacrifice, of, christians, he, wrote, perhaps, there, is, nothing, greater, on, earth, than, the, sacrifice, of, youth, and, beauty, often, of, high, birth, made, by, the, gentle, sex, in, order, to, work, in, hospitals, for, the, relief, of, human, misery, the, sight, of, which, is, so, revolting, to, our, delicacy, peoples, separated, from, the, roman, religion, have, imitated, but, imperfectly, so, generous, a, charity, yet, according, to, daniel, rops, voltaire, s, hatred, of, religion, increased, with, the, passage, of, years, the, attack, launched, at, first, against, clericalism, and, theocracy, ended, in, a, furious, assault, upon, holy, scripture, the, dogmas, of, the, church, and, even, upon, the, person, of, jesus, christ, himself, who, depicted, now, as, a, degenerate, voltaire, s, reasoning, may, be, summed, up, in, his, well, known, saying, those, who, can, make, you, believe, absurdities, can, make, you, commit, atrocities, according, to, orthodox, rabbi, joseph, telushkin, the, most, significant, enlightenment, hostility, against, judaism, was, found, in, voltaire, 30, of, the, 118, articles, in, his, dictionnaire, philosophique, dealt, with, jews, or, judaism, describing, them, in, consistently, negative, ways, for, example, in, voltaire, s, a, philosophical, dictionary, he, wrote, of, jews, in, short, we, find, in, them, only, an, ignorant, and, barbarous, people, who, have, long, united, the, most, sordid, avarice, with, the, most, detestable, superstition, and, the, most, invincible, hatred, for, every, people, by, whom, they, are, tolerated, and, enriched, telushkin, states, that, voltaire, did, not, limit, his, attack, to, aspects, of, judaism, that, christianity, used, as, a, foundation, repeatedly, making, it, clear, that, he, despised, jews, on, the, other, hand, peter, gay, a, contemporary, authority, on, the, enlightenment, points, to, voltaire, s, remarks, for, instance, that, the, jews, were, more, tolerant, than, the, christians, in, the, trait, sur, la, tol, rance, and, surmises, that, voltaire, struck, at, the, jews, to, strike, at, christianity, whatever, anti, semitism, voltaire, may, have, felt, gay, suggests, derived, from, negative, personal, experience, arthur, hertzberg, a, conservative, rabbi, claims, that, gay, s, second, suggestion, is, untenable, as, voltaire, himself, denied, its, validity, when, he, remarked, that, he, had, forgotten, about, much, larger, bankruptcies, through, christians, however, bertram, schwarzbach, s, far, more, detailed, studies, of, voltaire, s, dealings, with, jewish, people, throughout, his, life, concluded, that, he, was, anti, biblical, not, anti, semitic, his, remarks, on, the, jews, and, their, superstitions, were, essentially, no, different, from, his, remarks, on, christians, voltaire, said, of, the, jews, that, they, have, surpassed, all, nations, in, impertinent, fables, in, bad, conduct, and, in, barbarism, you, deserve, to, be, punished, for, this, is, your, destiny, he, further, said, they, are, all, of, them, born, with, raging, fanaticism, in, their, hearts, just, as, the, bretons, and, the, germans, are, born, with, blond, hair, i, would, not, be, in, the, least, bit, surprised, if, these, people, would, not, some, day, become, deadly, to, the, human, race, some, authors, link, voltaire, s, anti, judaism, to, his, polygenism, according, to, joxe, azurmendi, this, anti, judaism, has, a, relative, importance, in, voltaire, s, philosophy, of, history, however, voltaire, s, anti, judaism, influenced, later, authors, like, ernest, renan, voltaire, did, have, a, jewish, friend, daniel, de, fonseca, whom, he, esteemed, highly, and, proclaimed, him, as, the, only, philosopher, perhaps, among, the, jews, of, his, time, voltaire, condemned, the, persecution, of, jews, on, several, occasions, including, in, henriade, and, he, never, advocated, violence, or, attacks, against, them, according, to, the, historian, will, durant, voltaire, praised, the, simplicity, sobriety, regularity, and, industry, of, jews, but, subsequently, became, strongly, anti, semitic, after, some, personal, financial, transactions, and, quarrels, with, jewish, financiers, in, his, essai, sur, les, moeurs, voltaire, denounced, the, ancient, hebrews, in, strong, language, the, anti, semitic, passages, in, voltaire, s, dictionnaire, philosophique, were, criticized, by, isaac, de, pinto, in, 1762, subsequently, voltaire, agreed, with, the, criticism, of, the, anti, semitic, passages, and, stated, that, de, pinto, s, letter, convinced, him, that, there, are, highly, intelligent, and, cultivated, people, among, the, jews, and, that, he, had, been, wrong, to, attribute, to, a, whole, nation, the, vices, of, some, individuals, he, also, promised, to, revise, the, objectionable, passages, for, forthcoming, editions, of, the, dictionnaire, philosophique, but, he, failed, to, do, so, voltaire, s, views, about, islam, were, generally, negative, and, he, found, its, holy, book, the, quran, to, be, ignorant, of, the, laws, of, physics, in, a, 1740, letter, to, frederick, the, great, voltaire, ascribes, to, muhammad, a, brutality, that, is, assuredly, nothing, any, man, can, excuse, and, suggests, that, his, following, stemmed, from, superstition, voltaire, continued, but, that, a, camel, merchant, should, stir, up, insurrection, in, his, village, that, in, league, with, some, miserable, followers, he, persuades, them, that, he, talks, with, the, angel, gabriel, that, he, boasts, of, having, been, carried, to, heaven, where, he, received, in, part, this, unintelligible, book, each, page, of, which, makes, common, sense, shudder, that, to, pay, homage, to, this, book, he, delivers, his, country, to, iron, and, flame, that, he, cuts, the, throats, of, fathers, and, kidnaps, daughters, that, he, gives, to, the, defeated, the, choice, of, his, religion, or, death, this, is, assuredly, nothing, any, man, can, excuse, at, least, if, he, was, not, born, a, turk, or, if, superstition, has, not, extinguished, all, natural, light, in, him, in, 1748, after, having, read, henri, de, boulainvilliers, and, george, sale, he, wrote, again, about, mohammed, and, islam, in, de, l, alcoran, et, de, mahomet, on, the, quran, and, on, mohammed, in, this, essay, voltaire, maintained, that, mohammed, was, a, sublime, charlatan, drawing, on, complementary, information, in, herbelot, s, oriental, library, voltaire, according, to, ren, pomeau, adjudged, the, quran, with, its, contradictions, absurdities, anachronisms, to, be, rhapsody, without, connection, without, order, and, without, art, thus, he, henceforward, conceded, that, if, his, book, was, bad, for, our, times, and, for, us, it, was, very, good, for, his, contemporaries, and, his, religion, even, more, so, it, must, be, admitted, that, he, removed, almost, all, of, asia, from, idolatry, and, that, it, was, difficult, for, such, a, simple, and, wise, religion, taught, by, a, man, who, was, constantly, victorious, could, hardly, fail, to, subjugate, a, portion, of, the, earth, he, considered, that, its, civil, laws, are, good, its, dogma, is, admirable, which, it, has, in, common, with, ours, but, that, his, means, are, shocking, deception, and, murder, in, his, essay, on, the, manners, and, spirit, of, nations, published, 1756, voltaire, deals, with, the, history, of, europe, before, charlemagne, to, the, dawn, of, the, age, of, louis, xiv, and, that, of, the, colonies, and, the, east, as, a, historian, he, devoted, several, chapters, to, islam, voltaire, highlighted, the, arabian, turkish, courts, and, conducts, here, he, called, mohammed, a, poet, and, stated, that, he, was, not, an, illiterate, as, a, legislator, he, changed, the, face, of, part, of, europe, one, half, of, asia, in, chapter, vi, voltaire, finds, similarities, between, arabs, and, ancient, hebrews, that, they, both, kept, running, to, battle, in, the, name, of, god, and, sharing, a, passion, for, the, spoils, of, war, voltaire, continues, that, it, is, to, be, believed, that, mohammed, like, all, enthusiasts, violently, struck, by, his, ideas, first, presented, them, in, good, faith, strengthened, them, with, fantasy, fooled, himself, in, fooling, others, and, supported, through, necessary, deceptions, a, doctrine, which, he, considered, good, he, thus, compares, the, genius, of, the, arab, people, with, the, genius, of, the, ancient, romans, according, to, malise, ruthven, as, voltaire, learned, more, about, islam, his, opinion, of, the, faith, became, more, positive, as, a, result, his, play, mahomet, inspired, goethe, who, was, attracted, to, islam, to, write, a, drama, on, this, theme, though, he, completed, only, the, poem, mahomets, gesang, mahomet, s, singing, the, tragedy, fanaticism, or, mahomet, the, prophet, french, le, fanatisme, ou, mahomet, le, prophete, was, written, in, 1736, by, voltaire, the, play, is, a, study, of, religious, fanaticism, and, self, serving, manipulation, the, character, muhammad, orders, the, murder, of, his, critics, voltaire, described, the, play, as, written, in, opposition, to, the, founder, of, a, false, and, barbarous, sect, voltaire, described, muhammad, as, an, impostor, a, false, prophet, a, fanatic, and, a, hypocrite, defending, the, play, voltaire, said, that, he, tried, to, show, in, it, into, what, horrible, excesses, fanaticism, led, by, an, impostor, can, plunge, weak, minds, when, voltaire, wrote, in, 1742, to, c, sar, de, missy, he, described, muhammad, as, deceitful, in, his, play, muhammad, is, whatever, trickery, can, invent, that, is, most, atrocious, and, whatever, fanaticism, can, accomplish, that, is, most, horrifying, mahomet, here, is, nothing, other, than, tartuffe, with, armies, at, his, command, after, later, having, judged, that, he, had, made, muhammad, in, his, play, somewhat, nastier, than, he, really, was, voltaire, claimed, that, muhammad, stole, the, idea, of, an, angel, weighing, both, men, and, women, from, zoroastrians, who, are, often, referred, to, as, magi, voltaire, continued, about, islam, saying, nothing, is, more, terrible, than, a, people, who, having, nothing, to, lose, fight, in, the, united, spirit, of, rapine, and, of, religion, in, a, 1745, letter, recommending, the, play, to, pope, benedict, xiv, voltaire, described, muhammad, as, the, founder, of, a, false, and, barbarous, sect, and, a, false, prophet, voltaire, wrote, your, holiness, will, pardon, the, liberty, taken, by, one, of, the, lowest, of, the, faithful, though, a, zealous, admirer, of, virtue, of, submitting, to, the, head, of, the, true, religion, this, performance, written, in, opposition, to, the, founder, of, a, false, and, barbarous, sect, to, whom, could, i, with, more, propriety, inscribe, a, satire, on, the, cruelty, and, errors, of, a, false, prophet, than, to, the, vicar, and, representative, of, a, god, of, truth, and, mercy, his, view, was, modified, slightly, for, essai, sur, les, moeurs, et, l, esprit, des, nations, although, it, remained, negative, in, 1751, voltaire, performed, his, play, mohamet, once, again, with, great, success, commenting, on, the, sacred, texts, of, the, hindus, the, vedas, voltaire, observed, the, veda, was, the, most, precious, gift, for, which, the, west, had, ever, been, indebted, to, the, east, he, regarded, hindus, as, a, peaceful, and, innocent, people, equally, incapable, of, hurting, others, or, of, defending, themselves, voltaire, was, himself, a, supporter, of, animal, rights, and, was, a, vegetarian, he, used, the, antiquity, of, hinduism, to, land, what, he, saw, as, a, devastating, blow, to, the, bible, s, claims, and, acknowledged, that, the, hindus, treatment, of, animals, showed, a, shaming, alternative, to, the, immorality, of, european, imperialists, works, attributed, to, confucius, were, translated, into, european, languages, through, the, agency, of, jesuit, missionaries, stationed, in, china, matteo, ricci, was, among, the, earliest, to, report, on, the, teachings, of, confucius, and, father, prospero, intorcetta, wrote, about, the, life, and, works, of, confucius, in, latin, in, 1687, translations, of, confucian, texts, influenced, european, thinkers, of, the, period, particularly, among, the, deists, and, other, philosophical, groups, of, the, enlightenment, who, hoped, to, improve, european, morals, and, institutions, by, the, serene, doctrines, of, the, east, voltaire, shared, these, hopes, seeing, confucian, rationalism, as, an, alternative, to, christian, dogma, he, praised, confucian, ethics, and, politics, portraying, the, sociopolitical, hierarchy, of, china, as, a, model, for, europe, confucius, has, no, interest, in, falsehood, he, did, not, pretend, to, be, prophet, he, claimed, no, inspiration, he, taught, no, new, religion, he, used, no, delusions, flattered, not, the, emperor, under, whom, he, lived, with, the, translation, of, confucian, texts, during, the, enlightenment, the, concept, of, a, meritocracy, reached, intellectuals, in, the, west, who, saw, it, as, an, alternative, to, the, traditional, ancien, r, gime, of, europe, voltaire, wrote, favourably, of, the, idea, claiming, that, the, chinese, had, perfected, moral, science, and, advocating, an, economic, and, political, system, after, the, chinese, model, voltaire, rejected, the, biblical, adam, and, eve, story, and, was, a, polygenist, who, speculated, that, each, race, had, entirely, separate, origins, according, to, william, cohen, like, most, other, polygenists, voltaire, believed, that, because, of, their, different, origins, black, africans, did, not, entirely, share, the, natural, humanity, of, white, europeans, according, to, david, allen, harvey, voltaire, often, invoked, racial, differences, as, a, means, to, attack, religious, orthodoxy, and, the, biblical, account, of, creation, other, historians, instead, have, suggested, that, voltaire, s, support, for, polygenism, was, more, heavily, encouraged, by, his, investments, in, the, french, compagnie, des, indes, and, other, colonial, enterprises, that, engaged, in, the, slave, trade, his, most, famous, remark, on, slavery, is, found, in, candide, where, the, hero, is, horrified, to, learn, at, what, price, we, eat, sugar, in, europe, after, coming, across, a, slave, in, french, guiana, who, has, been, mutilated, for, escaping, who, opines, that, if, all, human, beings, have, common, origins, as, the, bible, taught, it, makes, them, cousins, concluding, that, no, one, could, treat, their, relatives, more, horribly, elsewhere, he, wrote, caustically, about, whites, and, christians, proceed, to, purchase, negroes, cheaply, in, order, to, sell, them, dear, in, america, voltaire, has, been, accused, of, supporting, the, slave, trade, as, per, a, letter, attributed, to, him, although, it, has, been, suggested, that, this, letter, is, a, forgery, since, no, satisfying, source, attests, to, the, letter, s, existence, in, his, philosophical, dictionary, voltaire, endorses, montesquieu, s, criticism, of, the, slave, trade, montesquieu, was, almost, always, in, error, with, the, learned, because, he, was, not, learned, but, he, was, almost, always, right, against, the, fanatics, and, the, promoters, of, slavery, zeev, sternhell, argues, that, despite, his, shortcomings, voltaire, was, a, forerunner, of, liberal, pluralism, in, his, approach, to, history, and, non, european, cultures, voltaire, wrote, we, have, slandered, the, chinese, because, their, metaphysics, is, not, the, same, as, ours, this, great, misunderstanding, about, chinese, rituals, has, come, about, because, we, have, judged, their, usages, by, ours, for, we, carry, the, prejudices, of, our, contentious, spirit, to, the, end, of, the, world, in, speaking, of, persia, he, condemned, europe, s, ignorant, audacity, and, ignorant, credulity, when, writing, about, india, he, declares, it, is, time, for, us, to, give, up, the, shameful, habit, of, slandering, all, sects, and, insulting, all, nations, in, essai, sur, les, m, urs, et, l, esprit, des, nations, he, defended, the, integrity, of, the, native, americans, and, wrote, favorably, of, the, inca, empire, according, to, victor, hugo, to, name, voltaire, is, to, characterize, the, entire, eighteenth, century, goethe, regarded, voltaire, as, the, greatest, literary, figure, of, modern, times, and, possibly, of, all, time, according, to, diderot, voltaire, s, influence, would, extend, far, into, the, future, napoleon, commented, that, till, he, was, sixteen, he, would, have, fought, for, rousseau, against, the, friends, of, voltaire, today, it, is, the, opposite, the, more, i, read, voltaire, the, more, i, love, him, he, is, a, man, always, reasonable, never, a, charlatan, never, a, fanatic, though, he, later, criticized, voltaire, s, work, mahomet, during, his, captivity, on, saint, helena, frederick, the, great, commented, on, his, good, fortune, for, having, lived, in, the, age, of, voltaire, and, corresponded, with, him, throughout, his, reign, until, voltaire, s, death, on, may, 12, 1760, frederick, wrote, for, my, part, i, shall, go, to, hades, and, tell, virgil, that, a, frenchman, has, surpassed, him, in, his, own, art, i, shall, say, as, much, to, sophocles, and, euripides, i, shall, speak, to, thucydides, of, your, histories, to, quintus, curtius, of, your, charles, xii, and, perhaps, i, shall, be, stoned, by, these, jealous, dead, because, a, single, man, has, united, all, their, different, merits, in, himself, in, england, voltaire, s, views, influenced, godwin, paine, mary, wollstonecraft, bentham, byron, and, shelley, macaulay, made, note, of, the, fear, that, voltaire, s, very, name, incited, in, tyrants, and, fanatics, in, russia, catherine, the, great, had, been, reading, voltaire, for, sixteen, years, prior, to, becoming, empress, in, 1762, in, october, 1763, she, began, a, correspondence, with, the, philosopher, that, continued, till, his, death, the, content, of, these, letters, has, been, described, as, being, akin, to, a, student, writing, to, a, teacher, upon, voltaire, s, death, the, empress, purchased, his, library, which, was, then, transported, and, placed, in, the, hermitage, alexander, herzen, remarked, that, the, writings, of, the, egoist, voltaire, did, more, for, liberation, than, those, of, the, loving, rousseau, did, for, brotherhood, in, his, famous, letter, to, n, v, gogol, vissarion, belinsky, wrote, that, voltaire, stamped, out, the, fires, of, fanaticism, and, ignorance, in, europe, by, ridicule, in, his, native, paris, voltaire, was, remembered, as, the, defender, of, jean, calas, and, pierre, sirven, although, voltaire, s, campaign, had, failed, to, secure, the, annulment, of, la, barre, s, execution, for, blasphemy, against, christianity, the, criminal, code, that, sanctioned, the, execution, was, revised, during, voltaire, s, lifetime, in, 1764, voltaire, successfully, intervened, and, secured, the, release, of, claude, chamont, arrested, for, attending, protestant, services, when, comte, de, lally, was, executed, for, treason, in, 1766, voltaire, wrote, a, 300, page, document, in, his, defense, subsequently, in, 1778, the, judgment, against, de, lally, was, expunged, just, before, voltaire, s, death, the, genevan, protestant, minister, pomaret, once, said, to, voltaire, you, seem, to, attack, christianity, and, yet, you, do, the, work, of, a, christian, frederick, the, great, noted, the, significance, of, a, philosopher, capable, of, influencing, judges, to, change, their, unjust, decisions, commenting, that, this, alone, is, sufficient, to, ensure, the, prominence, of, voltaire, as, a, humanitarian, under, the, french, third, republic, anarchists, and, socialists, often, invoked, voltaire, s, writings, in, their, struggles, against, militarism, nationalism, and, the, catholic, church, the, section, condemning, the, futility, and, imbecility, of, war, in, the, dictionnaire, philosophique, was, a, frequent, favorite, as, were, his, arguments, that, nations, can, only, grow, at, the, expense, of, others, following, the, liberation, of, france, from, the, vichy, regime, in, 1944, voltaire, s, 250th, birthday, was, celebrated, in, both, france, and, the, soviet, union, honoring, him, as, one, of, the, most, feared, opponents, of, the, nazi, collaborators, and, someone, whose, name, symbolizes, freedom, of, thought, and, hatred, of, prejudice, superstition, and, injustice, jorge, luis, borges, stated, that, not, to, admire, voltaire, is, one, of, the, many, forms, of, stupidity, and, included, his, short, fiction, such, as, microm, gas, in, the, library, of, babel, and, a, personal, library, gustave, flaubert, believed, that, france, had, erred, gravely, by, not, following, the, path, forged, by, voltaire, instead, of, rousseau, most, architects, of, modern, america, were, adherents, of, voltaire, s, views, according, to, will, durant, italy, had, a, renaissance, and, germany, had, a, reformation, but, france, had, voltaire, he, was, for, his, country, both, renaissance, and, reformation, and, half, the, revolution, he, was, first, and, best, in, his, time, in, his, conception, and, writing, of, history, in, the, grace, of, his, poetry, in, the, charm, and, wit, of, his, prose, in, the, range, of, his, thought, and, his, influence, his, spirit, moved, like, a, flame, over, the, continent, and, the, century, and, stirs, a, million, souls, in, every, generation, voltaire, s, junior, contemporary, jean, jacques, rousseau, commented, on, how, voltaire, s, book, letters, on, the, english, played, a, great, role, in, his, intellectual, development, having, written, some, literary, works, and, also, some, music, in, december, 1745, rousseau, wrote, a, letter, introducing, himself, to, voltaire, who, was, by, then, the, most, prominent, literary, figure, in, france, to, which, voltaire, replied, with, a, polite, response, subsequently, when, rousseau, sent, voltaire, a, copy, of, his, book, discourse, on, inequality, voltaire, replied, noting, his, disagreement, with, the, views, expressed, in, the, book, no, one, has, ever, employed, so, much, intellect, to, persuade, men, to, be, beasts, in, reading, your, work, one, is, seized, with, a, desire, to, walk, on, all, fours, however, as, it, is, more, than, sixty, years, since, i, lost, that, habit, i, feel, unfortunately, that, it, is, impossible, for, me, to, resume, it, subsequently, commenting, on, rousseau, s, romantic, novel, julie, or, the, new, heloise, voltaire, stated, no, more, about, jean, jacques, romance, if, you, please, i, have, read, it, to, my, sorrow, and, it, would, be, to, his, if, i, had, time, to, say, what, i, think, of, this, silly, book, voltaire, quipped, that, the, first, half, of, julie, had, been, written, in, a, brothel, and, the, second, half, in, a, lunatic, asylum, in, his, lettres, sur, la, nouvelle, heloise, written, under, a, pseudonym, voltaire, criticized, rousseau, s, grammatical, mistakes, paris, recognized, voltaire, s, hand, and, judged, the, patriarch, to, be, bitten, by, jealousy, in, reviewing, rousseau, s, book, emile, voltaire, dismissed, it, as, a, hodgepodge, of, a, silly, wet, nurse, in, four, volumes, with, forty, pages, against, christianity, among, the, boldest, ever, known, he, expressed, admiration, for, the, section, titled, profession, of, faith, of, the, savoyard, vicar, calling, it, fifty, good, pages, it, is, regrettable, that, they, should, have, been, written, by, such, a, knave, he, went, on, to, predict, that, emile, would, be, forgotten, within, a, month, in, 1764, rousseau, published, lettres, de, la, montagne, on, religion, and, politics, in, the, fifth, letter, he, wondered, why, voltaire, had, not, been, able, to, imbue, the, genevan, councilors, who, frequently, met, him, with, that, spirit, of, tolerance, which, he, preaches, without, cease, and, of, which, he, sometimes, has, need, the, letter, continued, with, an, imaginary, speech, in, the, voice, of, voltaire, acknowledging, authorship, of, the, heretical, book, sermon, of, the, fifty, which, the, real, voltaire, had, repeatedly, denied, in, 1772, when, a, priest, sent, rousseau, a, pamphlet, denouncing, voltaire, rousseau, responded, by, defending, his, rival, he, has, said, and, done, so, many, good, things, that, we, should, draw, the, curtain, over, his, irregularities, in, 1778, when, voltaire, was, given, unprecedented, honors, at, the, th, tre, fran, ais, an, acquaintance, of, rousseau, ridiculed, the, event, this, was, met, by, a, sharp, retort, from, rousseau, how, dare, you, mock, the, honors, rendered, to, voltaire, in, the, temple, of, which, he, is, the, god, and, by, the, priests, who, for, fifty, years, have, been, living, off, his, masterpieces, on, 2, july, 1778, rousseau, died, one, month, after, voltaire, in, october, 1794, rousseau, s, remains, were, moved, to, the, panth, on, near, the, remains, of, voltaire, louis, xvi, while, incarcerated, in, the, temple, lamented, that, rousseau, and, voltaire, had, destroyed, france, voltaire, perceived, the, french, bourgeoisie, to, be, too, small, and, ineffective, the, aristocracy, to, be, parasitic, and, corrupt, the, commoners, as, ignorant, and, superstitious, and, the, church, as, a, static, and, oppressive, force, useful, only, on, occasion, as, a, counterbalance, to, the, rapacity, of, kings, although, all, too, often, even, more, rapacious, itself, voltaire, distrusted, democracy, which, he, saw, as, propagating, the, idiocy, of, the, masses, voltaire, long, thought, only, an, enlightened, monarch, could, bring, about, change, given, the, social, structures, of, the, time, and, the, extremely, high, rates, of, illiteracy, and, that, it, was, in, the, king, s, rational, interest, to, improve, the, education, and, welfare, of, his, subjects, but, his, disappointments, and, disillusions, with, frederick, the, great, changed, his, philosophy, somewhat, and, soon, gave, birth, to, one, of, his, most, enduring, works, his, novella, candide, ou, l, optimisme, candide, or, optimism, 1759, which, ends, with, a, new, conclusion, of, quietism, it, is, up, to, us, to, cultivate, our, garden, his, most, polemical, and, ferocious, attacks, on, intolerance, and, religious, persecutions, indeed, began, to, appear, a, few, years, later, candide, was, also, burned, and, voltaire, jokingly, claimed, the, actual, author, was, a, certain, demad, in, a, letter, where, he, reaffirmed, the, main, polemical, stances, of, the, text, he, is, remembered, and, honored, in, france, as, a, courageous, polemicist, who, indefatigably, fought, for, civil, rights, such, as, the, right, to, a, fair, trial, and, freedom, of, religion, and, who, denounced, the, hypocrisies, and, injustices, of, the, ancien, r, gime, the, ancien, r, gime, involved, an, unfair, balance, of, power, and, taxes, between, the, three, estates, clergy, and, nobles, on, one, side, the, commoners, and, middle, class, who, were, burdened, with, most, of, the, taxes, on, the, other, he, particularly, had, admiration, for, the, ethics, and, government, as, exemplified, by, the, chinese, philosopher, confucius, voltaire, is, also, known, for, many, memorable, aphorisms, such, as, si, dieu, n, existait, pas, il, faudrait, l, inventer, if, god, did, not, exist, it, would, be, necessary, to, invent, him, contained, in, a, verse, epistle, from, 1768, addressed, to, the, anonymous, author, of, a, controversial, work, on, the, three, impostors, but, far, from, being, the, cynical, remark, it, is, often, taken, for, it, was, meant, as, a, retort, to, atheistic, opponents, such, as, d, holbach, grimm, and, others, he, has, had, his, detractors, among, his, later, colleagues, the, scottish, victorian, writer, thomas, carlyle, argued, that, voltaire, read, history, not, with, the, eye, of, devout, seer, or, even, critic, but, through, a, pair, of, mere, anti, catholic, spectacles, the, town, of, ferney, where, voltaire, lived, out, the, last, 20, years, of, his, life, was, officially, named, ferney, voltaire, in, honor, of, its, most, famous, resident, in, 1878, his, ch, teau, is, a, museum,

day, according, to, frederick, the, great, three, times, a, day, said, wagniere, it, has, been, suggested, that, high, amounts, of, caffeine, stimulated, his, creativity, his, great, grand, niece, was, the, mother, of, pierre, teilhard, de, chardin, a, catholic, philosopher, and, jesuit, priest, his, book, candide, was, listed, as, one, of, the, 100, most, influential, books, ever, written, by, martin, seymour, smith, in, the, 1950s, the, bibliographer, and, translator, theodore, besterman, started, to, collect, transcribe, and, publish, all, of, voltaire, s, writings, he, founded, the, voltaire, institute, and, museum, in, geneva, where, he, began, publishing, collected, volumes, of, voltaire, s, correspondence, on, his, death, in, 1976, he, left, his, collection, to, the, university, of, oxford, where, the, voltaire, foundation, became, established, as, a, department, the, foundation, has, continued, to, publish, the, complete, works, of, voltaire, a, complete,

plays, tragedies, including, a, few, unfinished, ones, among, them, are, yet, he, never, for, a, moment, supposed, that, in, this, splendid, outburst, all, france, would, accept, enthusiastically, the, philosophy, of, this, queer, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, from, geneva, and, paris, was, thrilling, the, world, with, sentimental, romances, and, revolutionary, pamphlets, the, complex, soul, of, france, seemed, to, have, divided, itself, into, these, two, men, so, different, and, yet, so, french, nietzsche, speaks, of, la, gaya, scienza, the, light, feet, wit, fire, grace, strong, logic, arrogant, intellectuality, the, dance, of, the, stars, surely, he, was, thinking, of, voltaire, now, beside, voltaire, put, rousseau, all, heat, and, fantasy, a, man, with, noble, and, jejune,
