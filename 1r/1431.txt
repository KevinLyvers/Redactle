october, 1944, at, the, second, plenary, session, of, the, communist, party, of, albania, the, session, considered, the, problems, that, the, post, independence, albanian, government, would, face, however, the, yugoslav, delegation, which, was, led, by, velimir, stoini, accused, the, party, of, sectarianism, and, opportunism, and, blamed, hoxha, for, these, errors, he, also, stressed, the, view, that, the, yugoslav, communist, partisans, spearheaded, the, albanian, partisan, movement, anti, yugoslav, members, of, the, albanian, communist, party, had, begun, to, think, that, this, was, a, plot, by, tito, who, intended, to, destabilize, the, party, ko, i, xoxe, sejfulla, mal, shova, and, others, who, supported, yugoslavia, were, looked, upon, with, deep, suspicion, tito, s, position, on, albania, was, that, it, was, too, weak, to, stand, on, its, own, and, that, it, would, do, better, as, a, part, of, yugoslavia, hoxha, alleged, that, tito, had, made, it, his, goal, to, get, albania, into, yugoslavia, firstly, by, creating, the, treaty, of, friendship, co, operation, and, mutual, aid, in, 1946, in, time, albania, began, to, feel, that, the, treaty, was, heavily, slanted, towards, yugoslav, interests, much, like, the, italian, agreements, with, albania, under, zog, that, made, the, nation, dependent, upon, italy, the, first, issue, was, that, the, albanian, lek, became, revalued, in, terms, of, the, yugoslav, dinar, as, a, customs, union, was, formed, and, albania, s, economic, plan, was, decided, more, by, yugoslavia, albanian, economists, h, banja, and, v, to, i, stated, that, the, relationship, between, albania, and, yugoslavia, during, this, period, was, exploitative, and, that, it, constituted, attempts, by, yugoslavia, to, make, the, albanian, economy, an, appendage, to, the, yugoslav, economy, hoxha, then, began, to, accuse, yugoslavia, of, misconduct, we, were, expected, to, produce, for, the, yugoslavs, all, the, raw, materials, which, they, needed, these, raw, materials, were, to, be, exported, to, the, metropolitan, yugoslavia, to, be, processed, there, in, yugoslav, factories, the, same, applied, to, the, production, of, cotton, and, other, industrial, crops, as, well, as, oil, bitumen, asphalt, chrome, etc, yugoslavia, would, supply, its, colony, albania, with, exorbitantly, priced, consumer, goods, including, even, items, such, as, needles, and, thread, and, would, provide, us, with, petrol, and, oil, as, well, as, glass, for, the, lamps, in, which, we, burn, the, fuel, extracted, from, our, subsoil, processed, in, yugoslavia, and, sold, to, us, at, high, prices, the, aim, of, the, yugoslavs, was, therefore, to, prevent, our, country, from, developing, either, its, industry, or, its, working, class, and, to, make, it, forever, dependent, on, yugoslavia, stalin, advised, hoxha, that, yugoslavia, was, attempting, to, annex, albania, we, did, not, know, that, the, yugoslavs, under, the, pretext, of, defending, your, country, against, an, attack, from, the, greek, fascists, wanted, to, bring, units, of, their, army, into, the, pra, they, tried, to, do, this, in, a, very, secretive, manner, in, reality, their, aim, in, this, direction, was, utterly, hostile, for, they, intended, to, overturn, the, situation, in, albania, by, june, 1947, the, central, committee, of, yugoslavia, began, publicly, condemning, hoxha, accusing, him, of, taking, an, individualistic, and, anti, marxist, line, when, albania, responded, by, making, agreements, with, the, soviet, union, to, purchase, a, supply, of, agricultural, machinery, yugoslavia, said, that, albania, could, not, enter, into, any, agreements, with, other, countries, without, yugoslav, approval, ko, i, xoxe, tried, to, stop, hoxha, from, improving, relations, with, bulgaria, reasoning, that, albania, would, be, more, stable, with, one, trading, partner, rather, than, with, many, nako, spiru, an, anti, yugoslav, member, of, the, party, condemned, xoxe, and, vice, versa, with, no, one, coming, to, spiru, s, defense, he, viewed, the, situation, as, hopeless, and, feared, that, yugoslav, domination, of, his, nation, was, imminent, which, caused, him, to, commit, suicide, in, november, at, the, eighth, plenum, of, the, central, committee, of, the, party, which, lasted, from, 26, february, to, 8, march, 1948, xoxe, was, implicated, in, a, plot, to, isolate, hoxha, and, consolidate, his, own, power, he, accused, hoxha, of, being, responsible, for, the, decline, in, relations, with, yugoslavia, and, stated, that, a, soviet, military, mission, should, be, expelled, in, favor, of, a, yugoslav, counterpart, hoxha, managed, to, remain, firm, and, his, support, had, not, declined, when, yugoslavia, publicly, broke, with, the, soviet, union, hoxha, s, support, base, grew, stronger, then, on, 1, july, 1948, tirana, called, on, all, yugoslav, technical, advisors, to, leave, the, country, and, unilaterally, declared, all, treaties, and, agreements, between, the, two, countries, null, and, void, xoxe, was, expelled, from, the, party, and, on, 13, june, 1949, he, was, executed, by, hanging, after, the, break, with, yugoslavia, hoxha, aligned, himself, with, the, soviet, union, from, 1948, to, 1960, 200, million, in, soviet, aid, was, given, to, albania, for, technical, and, infrastructural,

island, of, sazan, near, vlor, posing, a, hypothetical, threat, to, the, u, s, sixth, fleet, in, the, mediterranean, relations, with, the, soviet, union, remained, close, until, the, death, of, stalin, in, march, 1953, it, was, followed, by, 14, days, of, national, mourning, in, albania, more, than, in, the, soviet, union, hoxha, assembled, the, population, of, tirana, in, the, capital, s, largest, square, which, featured, a, stalin, statue, requested, that, they, kneel, and, take, a, 2, 000, word, oath, of, eternal, fidelity, and, gratitude, to, their, beloved, father, and, great, liberator, under, nikita, khrushchev, stalin, s, eventual, successor, aid, was, reduced, and, albania, was, encouraged, to, adopt, khrushchev, s, specialisation, policy, under, it, albania, would, develop, its, agricultural, output, in, order, to, supply, the, soviet, union, and, other, warsaw, pact, countries, while, they, would, be, developing, products, of, their, own, which, would, in, theory, strengthen, the, warsaw, pact, however, this, also, meant, that, albanian, industrial, development, which, was, heavily, stressed, by, hoxha, would, be, hindered, in, may, june, 1955, nikolai, bulganin, and, anastas, mikoyan, visited, yugoslavia, while, khrushchev, renounced, the, expulsion, of, yugoslavia, from, the, communist, bloc, khrushchev, also, began, making, references, to, palmiro, togliatti, s, polycentrism, theory, hoxha, had, not, been, consulted, on, this, and, was, offended, yugoslavia, began, asking, for, hoxha, to, rehabilitate, the, image, of, xoxe, which, hoxha, steadfastly, rejected, in, 1956, at, the, twentieth, party, congress, of, the, communist, party, of, the, soviet, union, khrushchev, condemned, the, cult, of, personality, that, had, been, built, up, around, stalin, and, denounced, his, excesses, khrushchev, then, announced, the, theory, of, peaceful, coexistence, which, angered, the, stalinist, hoxha, greatly, the, institute, of,

is, proletarian, internationalism, not, peaceful, coexistence, hoxha, now, took, a, more, active, stand, against, perceived, revisionism, unity, within, the, albanian, party, of, labour, began, to, decline, as, well, with, a, special, delegate, meeting, held, in, tirana, in, april, 1956, composed, of, 450, delegates, and, having, unexpected, results, the, delegates, criticized, the, conditions, in, the, party, the, negative, attitude, toward, the, masses, the, absence, of, party, and, socialist, democracy, the, economic, policy, of, the, leadership, etc, while, also, calling, for, discussions, on, the, cult, of, personality, and, the, twentieth, party, congress, in, 1956, hoxha, called, for, a, resolution, which, would, confirm, the, existing, leadership, of, the, party, the,

overthrow, the, leadership, of, albania, this, incident, increased, hoxha, s, power, effectively, making, khrushchev, style, reforms, impossible, there, in, the, same, year, hoxha, travelled, to, china, then, embroiled, in, the, sino, soviet, split, and, met, mao, zedong, chinese, aid, to, albania, rose, sharply, during, the, next, two, years, in, an, effort, to, keep, albania, in, the, soviet, sphere, increased, soviet, aid, was, given, but, albania, s, relations, with, the, soviet, union, remained, at, the, same, level, until, 1960, when, khrushchev, met, sofoklis, venizelos, a,

attended, in, albania, during, the, congress, mehmet, shehu, stated, that, while, many, members, of, the, party, were, accused, of, tyranny, this, was, a, baseless, charge, and, unlike, the, soviet, union, albania, was, led, by, genuine, marxists, the, soviet, union, retaliated, by, threatening, albania, with, dire, consequences, if, the, condemnations, were, not, retracted, days, later, khrushchev, and, anton, n, novotn, president, of, czechoslovakia, threatened, to, cut, off, economic, aid, in, march, albania, was, not, invited, to, attend, the, meeting, of, the, warsaw, pact,

which, were, based, on, theory, and, current, events, which, occurred, at, the, time, his, most, notable, criticisms, were, his, condemnations, of, maoism, after, 1978, a, major, achievement, under, hoxha, was, the, advancement, of, women, s, rights, albania, had, been, one, of, the, most, if, not, the, most, patriarchal, countries, in, europe, the, ancient, kanun, which, regulated, the, status, of, women, states, a, woman, is, known, as, a, sack, made, to, endure, as, long, as, she, lives, in, her, husband, s, house, women, were, not, allowed, to, inherit, anything, from, their, parents,

partisans, and, following, the, war, women, were, encouraged, to, take, up, menial, jobs, as, the, education, necessary, for, higher, level, work, was, out, of, most, women, s, reach, in, 1938, 4,

take, up, all, jobs, including, government, posts, which, resulted, in, 40, 7, of, the, people, s, councils, and, 30, 4, of, the, people, s, assembly, being, made, up, of, women, including, two, women, in, the, central, committee, by, 1985, in, 1978, 15, 1, times, as, many, females, attended, eight, year, schools, as, had, done, so, in, 1938, and, 175, 7, times, as, many, females, attended,

into, the, fire, and, break, the, neck, of, anyone, who, dared, trample, underfoot, the, sacred, edict, of, the, party, on, the, defense, of, women, s, rights, in, 1969, direct, taxation, was, abolished, and, during, this, period, the, quality, of, schooling, and, health, care, continued, to, improve, an, electrification, campaign, was, begun, in, 1960, and, the, entire, nation, was, expected, to, have, electricity, by, 1985, instead, it, achieved, this, on, 25, october, 1970, during, the, cultural, and, ideological, revolution, of, 1967, 1968, the, military, changed, from, traditional, communist, army, tactics, and, began, to, adhere, to, the, maoist, strategy, known, as, people, s, war, which, included, the, abolition, of, military, ranks, which, were, not, fully, restored, until, 1991, mehmet, shehu, said, of, the, country, s, health, service, in, 1979, he, health, service, is, free, of, charge, for, all, and, has, been, extended, to, the, remotest, villages, in, 1960, we, had, one, doctor, per, every, 3, 360, inhabitants, in, 1978, we, had, one, doctor, per, every, 687, inhabitants, and, this, despite, the, rapid, growth, of, the, population, the, natural, increase, of, the, population, in, our, country, is, 3, 5, times, higher, than, the, annual, average, of, european, countries, whereas, mortality, in, 1978, was, 37, lower, than, the, average, level, of, mortality, in, the, countries, of, europe, and, the, average, life, expectancy, in, our, country, has, risen, from, about, 38, years, in, 1938, to, 69, years, that, is, for, each, year, of, the, existence, of, our, people, s, state, power, the, average, life, expectancy, has, risen, by, about, 11, months, that, is, what, socialism, does, for, man, is, there, a, loftier, humanism, than, socialist, humanism, which, in, 35, years, doubles, the, average, life, expectancy, of, the, whole, population, of, the, country, hoxha, s, legacy, also, included, a, complex, of, 173, 371, one, man, concrete, bunkers, across, a, country, of, 3, million, inhabitants, to, act, as, look, outs, and, gun, emplacements, along, with, chemical, weapons, the, bunkers, were, built, strong, and, mobile, with, the, intention, that, they, could, be, easily, placed, by, a, crane, or, a, helicopter, in, a, hole, the, types, of, bunkers, vary, from, machine, gun, pillboxes, beach, bunkers, to, underground, naval, facilities, and, even, air, force, mountain, and, underground, bunkers, hoxha, s, internal, policies, were, true, to, stalin, s, paradigm, which, he, admired, and, the, personality, cult, which, was, developed, in, the, 1970s, and, organised, around, him, by, the, party, also, bore, a, striking, resemblance, to, that, of, stalin, at, times, it, even, reached, an, intensity, which, was, as, extreme, as, the, personality, cult, of, kim, il, sung, which, hoxha, condemned, with, hoxha, being, portrayed, as, a, genius, commenting, on, virtually, all, facets, of, life, from, culture, to, economics, to, military, matters, each, schoolbook, required, one, or, more, quotations, from, him, on, the, subjects, being, studied, the, party, honored, him, with, titles, such, as, supreme, comrade, sole, force, and, great, teacher, he, adopted, a, different, type, military, salute, for, the, people, s, army, to, render, honors, which, was, known, as, the, hoxhaist, salute, which, involves, soldiers, curling, their, right, fist, and, raising, it, to, shoulder, level, it, replaced, the, zogist, salute, which, was, used, by, the, royal, albanian, army, for, many, years, hoxha, s, governance, was, also, distinguished, by, his, encouragement, of, a, high, birthrate, policy, for, instance, a, woman, who, bore, an, above, average, number, of, children, would, be, given, the, government, award, of, heroine, mother, in, albanian, n, n, heroin, along, with, cash, rewards, abortion, was, essentially, restricted, to, encourage, high, birth, rates, except, if, the, birth, posed, a, danger, to, the, mother, s, life, though, it, was, not, completely, banned, the, process, was, decided, by, district, medical, commissions, as, a, result, the, population, of, albania, tripled, from, 1, million, in, 1944, to, around, 3, million, in, 1985, at, the, start, of, albania, s, third, five, year, plan, china, offered, albania, a, loan, of, 125, million, which, would, be, used, to, build, twenty, five, chemical, electrical, and, metallurgical, plants, in, accordance, with, the, plan, however, the, nation, discovered, that, the, task, of, completing, these, building, projects, was, difficult, because, albania, s, relations, with, its, neighbors, were, poor, and, because, matters, were, also, complicated, by, the, long, distance, between, albania, and, china, unlike, yugoslavia, or, the, ussr, china, had, less, economic, influence, on, albania, during, hoxha, s, rule, during, the, previous, fifteen, years, 1946, 1961, at, least, 50, of, albania, s, economy, was, dependent, on, foreign, commerce, by, the, time, the, 1976, constitution, was, promulgated, albania, had, mostly, become, self, sufficient, but, it, lacked, modern, technology, ideologically, hoxha, found, that, mao, s, initial, views, were, in, line, with, marxism, leninism, due, to, his, condemnation, of, khrushchev, s, alleged, revisionism, and, his, condemnation, of, yugoslavia, the, financial, aid, which, china, provided, to, albania, was, interest, free, and, it, did, not, have, to, be, repaid, until, albania, could, afford, to, do, so, china, never, intervened, in, albania, s, economic, output, and, chinese, technicians, and, albanian, workers, both, worked, for, the, same, wages, albanian, newspapers, were, reprinted, in, chinese, newspapers, and, they, were, also, read, on, chinese, radio, and, albania, led, the, movement, to, give, the, people, s, republic, of, china, a, seat, on, the, un, security, council, during, this, period, albania, became, the, second, largest, producer, of, chromium, in, the, world, which, china, considered, important, strategically, the, adriatic, sea, was, attractive, to, china, because, china, hoped, that, it, could, gain, more, allies, in, eastern, europe, through, albania, a, hope, which, was, misplaced, zhou, enlai, visited, albania, in, january, 1964, on, 9, january, the, 1964, sino, albanian, joint, statement, was, signed, in, tirana, the, statement, said, of, relations, between, socialist, countries, both, hold, that, the, relations, between, socialist, countries, are, international, relations, of, a, new, type, relations, between, socialist, countries, big, or, small, economically, more, developed, or, less, developed, must, be, based, on, the, principles, of, complete, equality, respect, for, territorial, sovereignty, and, independence, and, non, interference, in, each, other, s, internal, affairs, and, must, also, be, based, on, the, principles, of, mutual, assistance, in, accordance, with, proletarian, internationalism, it, is, necessary, to, oppose, great, nation, chauvinism, and, national, egoism, in, relations, between, socialist, countries, it, is, absolutely, impermissible, to, impose, the, will, of, one, country, upon, another, or, to, impair, the, independence, sovereignty, and, interests, of, the, people, of, a, fraternal, country, on, the, pretext, of, aid, or, international, division, of, labour, like, albania, china, defended, the, purity, of, marxism, by, attacking, american, imperialism, and, soviet, and, yugoslav, revisionism, both, of, them, were, equally, attacked, as, part, of, a, dual, adversary, theory, yugoslavia, was, viewed, as, both, a, special, detachment, of, u, s, imperialism, and, a, saboteur, against, world, revolution, however, these, views, began, to, change, in, china, which, was, one, of, the, major, issues, which, albania, had, with, the, alliance, additionally, unlike, yugoslavia, and, the, soviet, union, the, sino, albanian, alliance, lacked, an, organisational, structure, for, regular, consultations, and, policy, coordination, and, it, was, also, characterized, by, an, informal, relationship, which, was, conducted, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, mao, made, a, speech, on, 3, november, 1966, in, which, he, claimed, that, albania, was, the, only, marxist, leninist, state, in, europe, and, in, the, same, speech, he, also, stated, that, an, attack, on, albania, will, have, to, reckon, with, the, great, people, s, republic, of, china, if, the, u, s, imperialists, the, modern, soviet, revisionists, or, any, of, their, lackeys, dare, to, touch, albania, in, the, slightest, nothing, lies, ahead, for, them, but, a, complete, shameful, and, memorable, defeat, likewise, hoxha, stated, that, you, may, rest, assured, comrades, that, come, what, may, in, the, world, at, large, our, two, parties, and, our, two, peoples, will, certainly, remain, together, they, will, fight, together, and, they, will, win, together, during, the, cultural, revolution, china, entered, into, a, four, year, period, of, relative, diplomatic, isolation, however, its, relations, with, albania, were, positive, on, 20, august, 1968, the, soviet, invasion, of, czechoslovakia, was, condemned, by, albania, along, with, the, brezhnev, doctrine, albania, refused, to, send, troops, to, czechoslovakia, in, support, of, the, invasion, and, it, officially, withdrew, from, the, warsaw, pact, on, 5, september, albania, s, relations, with, china, began, to, deteriorate, on, 15, july, 1971, when, united, states, president, richard, nixon, agreed, to, visit, china, in, order, to, meet, with, zhou, enlai, hoxha, believed, that, china, had, betrayed, albania, and, on, 6, august, the, central, committee, of, the, pla, sent, a, letter, to, the, central, committee, of, the, ccp, in, which, it, called, nixon, a, frenzied, anti, communist, the, letter, stated, we, trust, you, will, understand, the, reason, for, the, delay, in, our, reply, this, was, because, your, decision, came, as, a, surprise, to, us, and, it, was, taken, without, any, preliminary, consultation, between, us, on, this, question, so, that, we, would, be, able, to, express, and, thrash, out, our, opinions, this, we, think, could, have, been, useful, because, preliminary, consultations, between, close, friends, determined, co, fighters, against, imperialism, and, revisionism, are, useful, and, necessary, and, especially, so, when, steps, which, in, our, opinion, have, a, major, international, effect, and, repercussions, are, taken, considering, the, communist, party, of, china, as, a, sister, party, and, our, closest, co, fighter, we, have, never, hidden, our, views, from, it, that, is, why, on, this, major, problem, which, you, put, before, us, we, inform, you, that, we, consider, your, decision, to, receive, nixon, in, beijing, as, incorrect, and, undesirable, and, we, do, not, approve, or, support, it, it, will, also, be, our, opinion, that, nixon, s, announced, visit, to, china, will, not, be, understood, or, approved, of, by, the, peoples, the, revolutionaries, and, the, communists, of, different, countries, the, result, of, this, criticism, was, a, message, from, the, chinese, leadership, in, 1971, in, which, it, stated, that, albania, could, not, depend, on, an, indefinite, flow, of, aid, from, china, and, in, 1972, albania, was, advised, to, curb, its, expectations, about, further, chinese, contributions, to, its, economic, development, by, 1972, hoxha, wrote, in, his, diary, reflections, on, china, that, china, was, no, longer, a, socialist, country, it, is, clear, that, china, is, not, following, a, policy, guided, by, marxism, leninism, its, policy, is, being, brought, into, line, and, will, be, brought, even, more, into, line, with, the, policy, of, a, great, power, which, is, trying, to, consolidate, its, positions, in, the, international, arena, through, friendships, through, alliances, through, pragmatic, relations, not, based, on, sound, marxist, leninist, principles, and, on, the, interests, of, socialism, and, the, world, revolution, but, on, the, interests, of, a, great, powerful, china, which, calls, itself, socialist, but, which, is, not, socialist, in, reality, and, in, 1973, he, wrote, that, the, chinese, leaders, have, cut, off, their, contacts, with, us, and, the, contacts, which, they, maintain, are, merely, formal, diplomatic, ones, albania, is, no, longer, the, faithful, special, friend, they, are, maintaining, the, economic, agreements, though, with, delays, but, it, is, quite, obvious, that, their, initial, ardor, has, died, in, response, trade, with, comecon, although, trade, with, the, soviet, union, was, still, blocked, and, yugoslavia, grew, trade, with, third, world, nations, was, 0, 5, million, in, 1973, but, 8, 3, million, in, 1974, trade, rose, from, 0, 1, to, 1, 6, following, mao, s, death, on, 9, september, 1976, hoxha, remained, optimistic, about, sino, albanian, relations, but, in, august, 1977, hua, guofeng, the, new, leader, of, china, stated, that, mao, s, three, worlds, theory, would, become, official, foreign, policy, hoxha, viewed, this, as, a, way, for, china, to, justify, having, the, u, s, as, the, secondary, enemy, while, viewing, the, soviet, union, as, the, main, one, thus, allowing, china, to, trade, with, the, u, s, he, stated, that, the, chinese, plan, of, the, third, world, is, a, major, diabolical, plan, with, the, aim, that, china, should, become, another, superpower, precisely, by, placing, itself, at, the, head, of, the, third, world, and, the, non, aligned, world, from, 30, august, to, 7, september, 1977, tito, visited, beijing, and, was, welcomed, by, the, chinese, leadership, following, this, the, pla, declared, that, china, was, now, a, revisionist, state, akin, to, the, soviet, union, and, yugoslavia, and, that, albania, was, the, only, marxist, leninist, state, on, earth, hoxha, stated, the, chinese, leaders, are, acting, like, the, leaders, of, a, great, state, they, think, the, albanians, fell, out, with, the, soviet, union, because, they, had, us, and, if, they, fall, with, us, too, they, will, go, back, to, the, soviets, therefore, they, say, either, with, us, or, the, soviets, it, is, all, the, same, the, albanians, are, done, for, but, to, hell, with, them, we, shall, fight, against, all, this, trash, because, we, are, albanian, marxist, leninists, and, on, our, correct, course, we, shall, always, triumph, on, 13, july, 1978, china, announced, that, it, was, cutting, off, all, of, its, aid, to, albania, for, the, first, time, in, modern, history, albania, did, not, have, an, ally, and, it, also, did, not, have, a, major, trading, partner, certain, clauses, in, the, 1976, constitution, circumscribed, the, exercise, of, political, liberties, which, the, government, interpreted, as, being, contrary, to, the, established, order, the, government, denied, the, population, access, to, information, other, than, that, which, was, disseminated, by, government, controlled, media, outlets, internally, the, sigurimi, used, the, same, repressive, methods, which, were, used, by, the, nkvd, the, mgb, the, kgb, and, the, east, german, stasi, at, one, point, every, third, albanian, had, either, been, interrogated, by, the, sigurimi, or, they, had, been, incarcerated, in, labour, camps, the, government, imprisoned, thousands, of, people, in, forced, labour, camps, or, it, executed, them, for, alleged, crimes, such, as, treachery,

in, an, interview, on, 10, july, 2002, archaeology, is, part, of, the, politics, which, the, party, in, power, has, and, this, was, understood, better, than, anything, else, by, enver, hoxha,

significant, role, in, albanian, nationalism, resulting, in, a, revival, of, given, names, supposedly, of, illyrian, origin, at, the, expense, of, given, names, associated, with, christianity, at, first, albanian, nationalist, writers, opted, for, the, pelasgians, as, the, forefathers, of, the, albanians, but, as, this, form, of, nationalism, flourished, in, albania, under, enver, hoxha, the, pelasgians, became, a, secondary, element, to, the, illyrian, theory, of, albanian, origins, which, could, claim, some, support, in, scholarship, the, illyrian, descent, theory, soon, became, one, of, the, pillars, of, albanian, nationalism, especially, because, it, could, provide, some, evidence, in, support, of, the, belief, that, there, was, a, continuous, albanian, presence, in, kosovo, and, southern, albania, i, e, areas, that, were, subjected, to, ethnic, conflicts, between, albanians, serbs, and, greeks, under, the, government, of, enver, hoxha, an, autochthonous, ethnogenesis, was,

claimed, that, the, illyrians, were, the, most, ancient, people, in, the, balkans, and, greatly, extended, the, age, of, the, illyrian, language, hoxha, and, his, government, were, also, hostile, to, western, popular, culture, as, it, was, manifested, in, the, mass, media, along, with, the, consumerism, and, cultural, liberalism, which, were, associated, with, it, in, a, speech, on, the, fourth, plenum, of, the, central, committee, of, the, pla, pla, cc, on, 26, june, 1973, hoxha, declared, a, definitive, break, with, any, such, western, bourgeois, influence, and, what, he, described, as, its, degenerated, bourgeois, culture, in, a, speech, in, which, he, also, criticised, the, spread, of, certain, vulgar, alien, tastes, in, music, and, art, which, ran, contrary, to, socialist, ethics, and, the, positive, traditions, of, our, people, including, degenerate, importations, such, as, long, hair, extravagant, dress, screaming, jungle, music, coarse, language, shameless, behaviour, and, so, on, hoxha, declared, it, is, precisely, this, culture, coated, with, a, glossy, veneer, accompanied, by, sensational, advertisement, handled, in, the, most, commercial, way, and, back, up, and, financed, by, the, bourgeoisie, that, inundates, the, cinema, and, television, screens, magazines, newspapers, and, radio, broadcasts, all, the, mass, information, and, propaganda, media, its, objective, is, to, turn, the, ordinary, man, into, a, passive, consumer, of, poisonous, bourgeois, ideas, and, to, make, this, consumption, an, addiction, not, only, have, we, nothing, to, learn, from, this, culture, no, reason, to, impart, it, to, our, masses, and, youth, but, we, must, reject, it, contemptuously, and, fight, it, with, determination, in, 1974, hoxha, accused, beqir, balluku,
