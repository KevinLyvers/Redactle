group, of, militants, known, as, the, army, protector, of, the, law, was, composed, of, small, groups, of, hondurans, nicaraguans, and, salvadorans, who, brought, their, own, tools, of, war, others, had, the, support, of, indians, who, served, as, infantry, some, volunteers, continued, his, liberal, convictions, others, worked, for, a, political, leader, others, simply, hoped, to, get, something, for, their, efforts, after, the, war, ended, this, was, the, combination, of, forces, that, joined, moraz, n, in, their, fight, against, federal, troops, while, the, salvadoran, army, battled, the, federal, forces, in, san, salvador, moraz, n, positioned, himself, in, the, eastern, part, of, the, state, on, july, 6, moraz, n, defeated, col, vicente, dominguez, s, federal, troops, at, the, el,

was, forced, to, wait, in, el, gualcho, at, 3, o, clock, in, the, morning, the, rain, stopped, i, put, two, companies, of, hunters, on, the, hill, overlooking, to, the, left, of, the, ranch, at, 5, o, clock, i, learned, the, position, occupied, by, the, enemy, i, could, not, go, back, under, these, circumstances, it, was, no, longer, possible, to, continue, the, march, without, serious, danger, a, vast, plain, and, the, very, presence, of, the, enemy, less, i, could, defend, myself, in, the, ranch, placed, under, a, height, of, more, than, 200, feet, it, was, therefore, necessary, to, accept, the, battle, with, all, the, advantages, reached, by, the, enemy, i, ordered, the, hunters, to, advance, over, the, enemy, to, stop, their, movement, while, the, force, rose, by, a, slope, and, narrow, path, fire, broke, out, but, 175, inexperienced, soldiers, made, impotent, for, quarter, of, an, hour, the, repeated, attacks, by, the, bulk, of, the, enemy, the, enthusiasm, that, produced, in, all, the, soldiers, the, heroism, of, these, brave, hondurans, exceeded, the, number, of, the, enemy, when, the, action, became, general, on, both, sides, our, right, wing, was, forced, to, back, down, and, occupied, the, light, artillery, that, supported, it, but, the, reserve, working, on, that, side, re, established, our, line, recovered, the, artillery, and, ended, the, action, the,

of, the, resistance, offered, by, the, enemy, shortly, after, moraz, n, placed, a, small, force, near, guatemala, city, under, the, command, of, col, gutierrez, to, force, the, enemy, out, of, their, trenches, and, to, cause, the, defection, of, their, troops, col, dominguez, had, left, from, guatemala, city, with, 600, infantrymen, to, attack, prem, but, he, was, informed, about, gutierrez, s,

liberties, confiscated, church, property, suppressed, religious, orders, and, removed, education, from, church, control, among, other, policies, all, of, this, new, approved, legislation, struck, a, blow, at, the, heart, of, the, guatemalan, oligarchy, but, more, importantly, it, stripped, the, spanish, clergy, of, their, privileges, and, curtailed, their, power, according, to, historian, mary, wilhelmine, williams, the, immediate, reasons, for, the, different, enactments, varied, some, laws, were, intended, to, protect, the, state, from, the, clergy, others, aimed, to, help, the, recoup, the, public, treasure, and, at, the, same, time, sweep, away, aristocratic, privilege, while, still, other, legislation, especially, that, of, latter, date, was, enacted, for, the, punishment, of, opposition, to, earlier, acts, and, of, intrigues, against, the, government, when, francisco, moraz, n, first, came, to, power, back, then, the, general, had, to, expel, from, the, country, archbishop, ramon, casaus, and, certain, members, of, the, monastic, orders, because, they, were, under, suspicion, of, opposing, independence, they, used, their, influence, against, him, and, the, liberal, party, during, the, civil, war, they, also, had, opposed, the, reforms, particularly, those, in, the, interest, of, general, education, which, the, liberals, were, determined, to, push, in, march, 1832, another, conflict, erupted, in, el, salvador, chief, of, state, jos, mar, a, cornejo, had, rebelled, against, some, federal, decrees, which, prompted, president, moraz, n, to, act, the, commander, in, chief, at, the, head, of, the, federal, troops, marched, on, to, el, salvador, where, they, defeated, cornejo, s, state, army, on, march, 14, on, the, 28th, of, the, same, month, moraz, n, had, occupied, san, salvador, from, that, point, forward, rumors, about, the, need, to, reform, the, constitution, began, in, 1834, at, the, request, of, governor, mariano, galvez, the, general, moved, the, capital, city, to, sonsonate, and, later, to, san, salvador, the, same, year, the, first, four, years, of, francisco, moraz, n, s, presidency, had, ended, according, to, the, constitution, elections, needed, to, be, held, in, order, to, elect, the, next, president, of, the, republic, moderate, jos, cecilio, del, valle, ran, against, the, incumbent, president, for, this, reason, general, francisco, moraz, n, deposited, the, presidency, on, general, gregorio, salazar, so, the, federal, congress, could, verify, the, fairness, of, the, election, when, all, the, votes, were, counted, jos, del, valle, had, defeated, francisco, moraz, n, the, federal, elections, showed, strong, popular, opposition, to, liberal, reforms, valle, however, died, before, taking, office, most, historians, agree, that, had, he, lived, he, might, have, brought, conciliation, and, harmony, between, the, opposing, forces, liberals, and, conservatives, on, june, 2, the, federal, congress, called, for, new, elections, which, were, won, by, francisco, moraz, n, on, february, 14, 1835, general, moraz, n, was, sworn, as, president, for, a, second, term, in, february, 1837, there, occurred, in, central, america, a, series, of, events, that, ignited, a, revolution, that, culminated, with, the, fall, of, the, federation, an, epidemic, of, cholera, scourged, guatemala, leaving, approximately, 1000, people, dead, and, 3000, infected, with, the, bacteria, the, epidemic, struck, especially, the, poor, and, the, indians, in, the, highlands, of, the, state, at, the, time, when, it, appeared, the, indians, of, the, district, of, mita, influenced, by, their, priests, were, much, perturbed, over, the, system, of, trial, by, jury, incomprehensible, to, them, which, was, being, introduced, the, disease, spread, rapidly, and, the, government, of, mariano, galvez, hoping, to, alleviate, the, situation, dispatched, the, available, physicians, medical, students, and, remedies, for, distribution, but, these, measures, were, of, little, help, because, the, indians, continued, to, die, the, church, viewed, this, as, an, opportunity, to, strike, back, at, the, liberal, government, of, mariano, g, lvez, the, local, priests, spread, the, rumor, that, the, government, had, poisoned, the, rivers, and, streams, for, the, purpose, of, wiping, out, the, indigenous, population, and, repopulating, it, with, foreigners, in, proof, they, pointed, to, a, recent, grant, of, territory, in, vera, paz, made, to, a, british, colonization, company, a, cry, was, then, raised, by, the, frantic, indians, against, their, supposed, murderers, as, the, cholera, continued, to, spread, the, indians, took, to, arms, killed, whites, and, liberals, burned, their, houses, and, prepared, to, confront, galvez, s, government, the, governor, sent, an, army, to, try, to, stop, the, revolt, but, the, army, s, measures, were, so, repressive, that, it, only, made, matters, worse, by, june, santa, rosa, erupted, and, from, the, village, of, mataquescuintla, emerged, a, young, rafael, carrera, carrera, was, an, illiterate, but, shrewd, and, charismatic, swineherd, turned, highwayman, whom, the, rebels, wanted, as, their, leader, the, priests, proclaimed, to, the, natives, that, he, was, their, protecting, angel, rafael, descended, from, the, heavens, to, take, vengeance, on, the, heretics, liberals, and, foreigners, and, to, restore, their, ancient, dominion, they, devised, various, tricks, to, favor, the, delusion, which, were, heralded, as, miracles, a, letter, was, let, down, from, the, roof, of, one, of, the, churches, in, the, midst, of, a, vast, congregation, of, indians, which, was, supposed, to, come, from, the, virgin, mary, commissioning, carrera, to, lead, a, revolt, against, the, government, under, cries, of, long, live, religion, and, death, to, foreigners, carrera, and, his, forces, initiated, a, war, against, the, government, encouraged, by, these, events, the, conservatives, joined, in, the, liberal, government, called, general, moraz, n, for, help, francisco, moraz, n, repeatedly, defeated, carrera, s, forces, and, pacified, the, state, but, he, could, never, catch, the, indian, leader, as, he, simply, retreated, to, the, mountains, and, came, back, to, re, occupy, the, key, positions, as, soon, as, moraz, n, s, troops, left, by, 1838, moraz, n, was, presiding, over, a, dying, institution, galvez, had, relinquished, power, congress, tried, to, restore, some, life, to, the, federal, government, by, transferring, control, of, their, custom, revenues, but, honduras, nicaragua, and, costa, rica, opposed, this, move, and, used, it, as, an, opportunity, to, leave, the, union, the, federation, was, dead, on, february, 1, 1839, moraz, n, had, completed, his, second, constitutional, term, as, president, congress, had, dissolved, and, there, was, no, legal, basis, to, name, his, successor, in, the, end, a, failure, at, compromise, the, power, of, the, church, bitter, infighting, between, conservatives, and, liberals, and, the, quest, for, personal, glory, were, the, main, reasons, for, the, downfall, of, the, federation, after, francisco, moraz, n, s, second, term, as, president, of, the, federal, republic, ended, he, was, left, without, political, or, military, power, on, july, 13, 1839, however, the, general, was, elected, chief, of, state, of, el, salvador, when, rafael, carrera, and, the, guatemalan, conservatives, learned, about, moraz, n, s, new, role, they, declared, war, on, el, salvador, francisco, moraz, n, personified, the, old, federation, itself, and, for, that, reason, alone, they, vowed, to, defeat, him, on, july, 24, guatemala, and, nicaragua, signed, a, treaty, of, alliance, against, moraz, n, s, government, carrera, called, on, the, salvadoran, people, to, rise, against, their, government, these, calls, resulted, in, small, uprisings, within, el, salvador, but, these, were, quickly, put, down, without, much, effort, by, moraz, n, when, carrera, s, attempt, failed, moraz, n, s, enemies, formed, an, army, of, nicaraguan, and, honduran, troops, on, september, 25, 1839, these, forces, invaded, el, salvador, and, faced, moraz, n, s, army, during, the, battle, of, san, pedro, perulap, n, the, general, only, needed, 600, salvadorans, to, defeat, 2, 000, men, commanded, by, generals, francisco, ferrera, nicol, s, de, espinosa, and, manuel, quijano, after, their, defeat, the, humiliated, generals, and, their, troops, fled, to, neighboring, states, leaving, behind, over, three, hundred, dead, on, march, 18, 1840, moraz, n, made, a, last, attempt, to, restore, the, union, he, gathered, what, he, thought, were, enough, salvadoran, forces, to, face, carrera, and, with, them, marched, to, guatemala, once, positioned, moraz, n, moved, in, from, the, south, striking, towards, the, capital, carrera, pulled, most, of, his, own, force, out, of, the, capital, leaving, only, a, small, very, visible, garrison, inside, moraz, n, jumped, in, slaughtered, much, of, the, bait, then, found, himself, assaulted, from, all, directions, by, carrera, s, main, force, of, about, 5, 000, men, the, battle, became, notorious, for, its, savagery, and, revealed, the, ruthless, side, of, carrera, whose, indians, sang, salve, regina, and, shouted, long, live, carrera, death, to, moraz, n, by, the, next, morning, moraz, n, was, running, out, of, ammunition, he, then, ordered, an, increase, in, fire, from, three, corners, of, the, plaza, in, order, to, attract, attention, while, he, himself, slipped, out, through, the, fourth, corner, of, the, plaza, with, a, small, escort, to, escape, back, to, el, salvador, this, time, the, general, did, not, have, the, support, he, needed, from, the, common, people, as, he, had, had, in, 1830, the, liberal, reforms, had, not, produced, enough, results, for, the, citizenry, moreover, they, resented, some, of, these, reforms, this, was, the, case, with, the, livingston, code, which, changed, the, system, of, taxation, among, other, reforms, as, for, the, liberals, they, were, too, busy, fighting, among, themselves, that, even, former, liberal, president, jos, francisco, barrundia, had, joined, rafael, carrera, moraz, n, s, defeat, was, so, decisive, that, on, march, 27, he, deposited, the, headquarters, of, the, state, in, the, hands, of, director, jos, antonio, canas, and, directed, a, proclamation, to, the, people, of, el, salvador, moraz, n, did, not, want, to, cause, any, more, problems, for, the, salvadorans, with, francisco, moraz, n, s, final, defeat, the, hopes, of, a, central, american, federation, vanished, on, april, 8, 1840, general, francisco, moraz, n, went, into, exile, he, left, from, the, port, of, la, libertad, in, el, salvador, and, embarked, on, the, schooner, izalco, accompanied, by, 30, of, his, closest, friends, and, war, veterans, he, stopped, in, costa, rica, where, he, sought, and, obtained, political, asylum, for, most, of, his, companions, seven, continued, on, the, journey, to, south, america, with, him, moraz, n, landed, at, chiriqu, province, then, moved, on, to, david, chiriqu, where, his, family, awaited, him, while, in, david, moraz, n, was, informed, by, his, friends, of, the, fierce, persecutions, suffered, by, his, supporters, at, the, hands, of, rafael, carrera, and, other, central, american, leaders, outraged, by, this, and, by, the, chain, of, insults, and, slander, against, him, by, some, members, of, the, press, he, wrote, and, published, his, famous, manifest, of, david, dated, july, 16, 1841, while, he, was, still, in, david, moraz, n, also, received, calls, from, his, liberal, colleagues, in, costa, rica, braulio, carrillo, governor, of, that, state, had, restricted, individual, liberties, placed, limits, on, freedom, of, the, press, and, derogated, the, political, constitution, of, 1825, he, replaced, it, with, a, new, constitutional, charter, denominated, law, of, bases, and, guarantees, where, he, declared, himself, chief, of, state, for, life, furthermore, carrillo, declared, costa, rica, a, free, and, independent, state, however, moraz, n, wanted, to, stay, away, from, central, america, affairs, and, travelled, to, peru, once, in, lima, he, received, the, invitation, of, mariscal, agust, n, gamarra, to, command, a, peruvian, division, at, a, time, when, his, country, was, at, war, with, chile, but, moraz, n, declined, because, he, found, this, war, very, confusing, and, troubling, peru, bolivia, colombia, and, chile, were, all, involved, in, a, twelve, year, war, which, brought, about, a, train, of, baneful, stages, of, chaos, among, all, countries, involved, in, peru, moraz, n, was, fortunate, to, find, good, friends, with, whom, he, shared, the, same, ideals, these, included, generals, jos, rufino, echenique, and, pedro, bermudez, around, 1841, the, english, began, to, intervene, in, the, mosquito, territory, located, between, honduras, and, nicaragua, this, intervention, prompted, moraz, n, to, end, his, self, imposed, peruvian, exile, and, he, decided, that, it, was, time, to, return, to, central, america, with, the, financial, backing, of, general, pedro, bermudez, he, departed, from, callao, on, board, the, crusader, in, late, december, 1841, on, that, trip, he, was, accompanied, by, general, caba, as, and, saravia, and, five, other, officers, he, and, his, companions, made, stops, in, guayaquil, ecuador, and, chiriqui, where, he, met, with, his, family, before, returning, to, central, america, on, january, 15, 1842, moraz, n, arrived, in, el, salvador, he, made, himself, available, to, the, central, american, leaders, for, the, common, defense, against, the, british, intervention, on, february, 16, 1842, he, told, his, countrymen, that, his, return, was, a, duty, and, an, irresistible, national, sentiment, not, only, for, him, but, for, all, those, who, have, a, heart, for, their, homeland, but, his, offers, were, rejected, nonetheless, after, this, episode, he, put, forth, a, plan, to, overthrow, costa, rican, head, of, state, braulio, carrillo, carrillo, a, reformer, responsible, for, the, expansion, of, coffee, production, in, costa, rica, had, taken, the, first, steps, towards, ending, costa, rica, s, political, links, with, central, america, in, la, union, el, salvador, moraz, n, hired, three, boats, he, then, travelled, to, acajutla, san, salvador, and, sonsonate, where, he, was, able, to, reactivate, the, local, forces, from, acajutla, he, left, for, the, island, of, martin, perez, located, on, the, gulf, of, fonseca, there, he, organized, a, military, contingent, of, about, 500, men, on, april, 7, and, without, any, mishap, moraz, n, s, fleet, of, five, vessels, landed, at, port, of, caldera, in, costa, rica, when, braulio, carrillo, was, informed, of, the, presence, of, moraz, n, in, costa, rica, he, organized, a, military, force, under, the, command, of, general, vicente, villasenor, on, april, 9, 1842, moraz, n, issued, a, proclamation, to, the, people, of, costa, rica, in, which, he, stated, that, he, was, never, indifferent, to, the, misfortunes, of, the, costa, rican, people, your, cries, he, said, have, for, a, long, time, hurt, my, ears, and, i, finally, found, the, means, to, save, you, even, at, the, expense, of, my, own, life, moraz, n, avoided, an, armed, confrontation, with, the, forces, sent, by, carrillo, through, negotiations, in, which, he, offered, villase, or, higher, positions, once, the, federation, was, restored, he, got, him, to, betray, his, government, they, signed, the, jocote, accord, this, agreement, provided, for, the, integration, of, a, single, military, body, the, convening, of, a, national, constituent, assembly, the, ousting, of, braulio, carrillo, and, other, members, of, his, administration, and, the, installation, of, a, provisional, government, under, the, command, of, francisco, moraz, n, on, april, 13, 1842, moraz, n, s, forces, entered, the, city, of, san, jos, thereafter, chief, carrillo, was, forced, to, accept, the, treaty, he, approved, it, only, when, some, modifications, were, added, he, then, turned, the, government, over, to, moraz, n, and, left, the, country, moraz, n, s, first, act, was, to, open, the, doors, of, the, state, to, costa, rican, and, central, american, political, refugees, he, then, abolished, the, laws, that, carrillo, had, imposed, limiting, trade, and, property, restored, individual, and, political, rights, devoted, himself, to, urgent, reforms, and, convened, the, constituent, assembly, which, appointed, him, supreme, chief, of, the, costa, rican, state, according, to, historian, gomez, carrillo, in, the, months, that, followed, moraz, n, concentrated, on, recruiting, military, personnel, for, the, purpose, of, restoring, the, central, america, motherland, thereafter, rumors, of, the, possibility, of, war, against, the, neighboring, states, spread, this, troubled, costa, ricans, they, feared, rafael, carrera, would, intervene, in, their, affairs, specially, after, guatemala, broke, ties, with, them, in, addition, they, felt, financially, incapable, of, sustaining, a, war, and, also, considered, it, unnecessary, after, all, the, restoration, of, the, union, was, a, cause, they, didn, t, believe, in, for, all, these, reasons, they, decided, to, conspire, against, moraz, n, on, september, 11, 1842, a, popular, movement, opposed, to, moraz, n, erupted, in, san, jos, led, by, portuguese, general, ant, nio, pinto, soares, 400, men, attacked, moraz, n, s, guard, of, 40, salvadorans, moraz, n, and, his, men, managed, to, repel, the, attacks, and, retreat, to, their, headquarters, the, fighting, continued, bloody, and, relentless, and, the, insurgents, increased, to, 1, 000, while, the, number, of, the, besieged, diminished, chaplain, jos, castro, then, proposed, a, capitulation, to, moraz, n, ensuring, his, life, but, he, refused, after, 88, hours, of, fighting, moraz, n, and, his, closest, collaborators, resolved, to, break, the, siege, general, jos, caba, as, with, 30, men, held, the, retreat, which, made, it, possible, for, the, others, to, flee, towards, cartago, but, the, insurrection, had, spread, there, too, so, moraz, n, turned, for, help, to, his, friend, pedro, mayorga, but, mayorga, betrayed, him, and, turned, him, over, to, his, enemies, along, with, generals, vicente, villase, or, jos, saravia, and, jos, trinidad, caba, as, saravia, committed, suicide, villase, or, attempted, the, same, but, survived, subsequently, moraz, n, and, vicente, villase, or, were, sentenced, to, death, on, september, 15, moraz, n, and, villase, or, were, transferred, to, the, central, plaza, in, san, jos, before, his, execution, moraz, n, dictated, his, famous, will, to, his, son, francisco, in, it, he, calls, his, death, murder, and, declares, i, do, not, have, enemies, nor, the, smaller, resentment, i, take, to, the, grave, against, my, murderers, i, forgive, them, and, wish, them, the, greatest, good, when, he, was, done, a, chair, was, offered, to, him, but, he, refused, it, seated, next, to, him, was, gen, villase, or, sedated, and, almost, unconscious, moraz, n, then, said, dear, friend, posterity, will, do, us, justice, and, crossed, himself, a, few, minutes, later, moraz, n, himself, commanded, the, firing, squad, that, ended, his, life, and, that, of, villase, or, with, his, death, the, nation, lost, a, man, described, by, jos, mart, as, a, powerful, genius, a, strategist, a, speaker, a, true, statesman, perhaps, the, only, one, central, america, has, ever, produced, in, 1848, the, government, of, jos, mar, a, castro, sent, moraz, n, s, remains, to, el, salvador, fulfilling, one, of, his, last, wishes, more, than, a, man, of, ideas, moraz, n, was, a, man, of, action, wrote, biographer, rafael, eliodoro, valle, but, his, name, cannot, fail, to, brighten, the, history, of, ideas, in, central, america, because, he, knew, how, to, instill, in, them, the, power, of, his, sincerity, the, passion, that, inflamed, him, and, his, faith, in, the, future, like, men, of, vision, who, always, think, big, francisco, moraz, n, pushed, with, his, liberal, and, progressive, ideas, a, series, of, revolutionary, measures, for, the, time, thus, promoting, education, immigration, established, freedom, of, worship, and, the, press, the, first, federal, administration, headed, by, moraz, n, was, oriented, to, the, peaceful, reconstruction, of, the, several, states, that, comprised, the, republic, when, liberalism, seemed, to, finally, find, the, opportunity, to, implement, its, noblest, principles, after, a, long, process, of, integration, as, ideological, tendency, as, a, political, group, and, as, a, power, option, the, liberal, regime, was, unable, to, achieve, cohesion, within, the, central, american, society, the, liberals, sustained, fight, against, the, aristocracy, and, their, quest, to, exclude, conservatives, from, political, life, was, not, accompanied, by, a, parallel, effort, to, integrate, other, sectors, such, as, indigenous, people, the, bulk, of, the, population, to, the, national, modern, project, that, they, so, vehemently, postulated, the, indigenous, people, never, found, the, liberal, proposal, to, be, attractive, enough, so, as, to, break, free, from, the, deep, rooted, ancient, order, taught, by, the, church, and, the, stability, they, have, had, for, three, centuries, under, the, colonial, regime, according, to, writer, david, alejandro, luna, one, of, moraz, n, s, biggest, mistakes, was, to, not, design, a, plan, to, break, the, feudal, estates, where, his, secular, enemies, were, sitting, moraz, n, s, fight, was, marred, of, romanticism, his, strategic, line, tended, to, politically, displace, the, oppressive, aristocratic, landowners, of, central, america, his, tactics, however, disagreed, with, the, political, reality, despite, the, strenuous, efforts, made, by, general, francisco, moraz, n, from, the, presidency, of, the, republic, the, clerical, and, aristocratic, forces, staged, a, strong, anti, liberal, building, block, taking, advantage, of, the, fanaticism, and, discontent, that, permeated, large, sections, of, the, population, especially, in, the, state, of, guatemala, francisco, moraz, n, became, a, martyr, and, a, symbol, of, the, republic, of, central, america, he, gave, his, life, however, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, preserve, the, union, now, more, than, 160, years, after, his, death, central, america, is, still, plagued, by, power, struggles, corruption, and, poverty, more, often, than, not, the, five, republics, have, emulated, carrera, than, moraz, n, but, the, dream, of, the, great, central, american, country, is, still, alive, his, image, can, be, found, in, bills, logos, and, stamps, institutions, cities, departments, schools, and, parks, among, other, things, bear, moraz, n, s, name, in, order, to, preserve, his, legacy, el, salvador, was, among, the, first, countries, to, pay, tribute, to, moraz, n, on, march, 14, 1887, the, national, assembly, of, the, republic, of, el, salvador, replaced, the, name, of, the, department, of, gotera, with, moraz, n, so, as, to, perpetuate, the, name, of, the, great, leader, of, the, central, american, union, in, 1943, honduras, renamed, the, tegucigalpa, department, francisco, moraz, n, on, november, 15, 1887, the, town, of, tocoy, tzim, became, moraz, n, in, guatemala, in, 1945, port, moraz, n, was, founded, in, nicaragua, costa, rica, the, country, that, he, invaded, and, where, he, died, honored, him, with, a, park, in, the, center, of, its, capital, san, jose, in, the, political, field, the, idea, of, integration, is, still, preserved, in, the, mind, of, many, central, americans, for, example, there, is, the, central, american, parliament, also, known, by, the, abbreviation, parlacen, from, the, spanish, parlamento, centroamericano, this, is, a, political, institution, devoted, to, the, integration, of, the, central, american, countries, the, parlacen, represents, a, modern, version, of, the, historic, federal, republic, of, central, america, although, it, does, not, include, costa, rica, it, does, include, the, dominican, republic, panama, used, to, be, a, member, but, left, during, the, government, of, president, martinelli, in, the, past, several, unsuccessful, attempts, have, been, made, to, restore, the, union, 1851, 1886, 1921, moraz, n, s, legacy, is, also, present, in, the, arts, the, first, play, on, record, in, el, salvador, is, titled, la, tragedy, of, moraz, n, written, by, francisco, d, az, 1812, 45, and, dramatizing, the, life, of, the, central, american, president, the, modern, period, in, honduran, theater, began, with, luis, andr, s, z, iga, portillo,
