ivan, stamboli, responded, by, accepting, this, position, declaring, that, the, 1974, constitution, was, contrary, to, the, interests, of, serbs, though, he, warned, that, certain, individuals, were,

effectively, meant, that, slobodan, milo, evi, and, his, supporters, held, power, in, four, out, of, the, eight, republics, and, autonomous, provinces, that, made, up, the, yugoslav, federation, whether, this, was, cynically, engineered, by, milo, evi, is, a, matter, of, controversy, between, his, critics, and, his, supporters, because, milo, evi, s, supporters, controlled, half, of, the, votes, in, the, sfry, presidency, his, critics, charge, that, he, undermined, the, yugoslav, federation, this, his, detractors, argue, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, yugoslavia, and, provoked,

evi, enjoyed, genuine, popular, support, so, it, was, perfectly, logical, for, his, allies, to, be, elected, to, the, presidency, his, supporters, dismiss, allegations, that, he, upset, the, balance, of, power, in, yugoslavia, as, a, propaganda, ploy, designed, to, justify, separatism, in, 1990, after, other, republics, abandoned, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, and, adopted,

republic, of, serbia, to, the, republic, of, serbia, and, abandoned, the, one, party, communist, system, and, created, a, democratic, multiparty, system, after, the, creation, of, a, multiparty, system, in, serbia, milo, evi, and, his, political, allies, in, serbia, elsewhere, in, yugoslavia, pushed, for, the, creation, of, a, democratic, multiparty, system, of, government, at, the, federal, level, such, as, serbian, state, media, appealing, to, the, citizens, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, in, early, 1992, with, the, promise, that, bosnia, and, herzegovina, could, peacefully, coexist, in, a, democratic, yugoslav, federation, alongside, the, republics, of, serbia, and, montenegro, in, the, aftermath, serbia, and, montenegro, agreed, to, create, the, new, yugoslav, federation, called,

supporting, trade, barriers, in, order, to, protect, local, industries, despite, this, many, accused, milo, evi, of, creating, a, kleptocracy, by, transferring, ownership, much, of, the, industrial, and, financial, sector, to, his, political, allies, and, financiers, under, heavy, economic, sanctions, from, the, united, nations, due, to, milo, evi, s, perceived, role, in, the, yugoslav, wars,

deutsche, mark, milo, evi, s, role, in, the, signing, of, the, dayton, accords, allowed, the, lifting, of, most, economic, sanctions, but, the, fr, yugoslavia, was, still, not, allowed, access, to, financial, and, foreign, aid, due, to, the, perceived, oppression, of, albanians, in, kosovo, the, serbian, economy, began, growing, from, the, period, of, 1994, 1998, at, one, point, even, reaching, a, growth, rate, of, 10, 1, percent, in, 1997, however, this, growth, rate, was, not, sufficient, enough, to, return, serbia, to, its, pre, war, economic, status, in, order, to, pay, out, pensions, and, wages, milo, evi, s, socialist, government, had, no, choice, but, to, begin, selling, off, serbia, s, most, profitable, telecommunications, which, gave, the, federal, government, about, 1, 05, billion, more, in, revenue, in, 1998, milo, evic, promised, to, introduce, a, new, economic, program, which, would, begin, a, process, of, market, reforms, reduction, of, trade, barriers, and, the, privatization, of, more, state, owned, enterprises, in, order, to, achieve, an, economic, growth, rate, of, 10, however, this, plan, was, never, implemented, due, to, the, kosovo, war, the, nato, bombing, of, yugoslavia, and, his, subsequent, overthrow, in, october, 2000, milo, evi, s, government, policies, on, civil, and, political, rights, when, serving, as, serbian, president, and, later, yugoslav, president, were, controversial, milo, evi, s, government, exercised, influence, and, censorship, in, the, media, an, example, was, in, march, 1991, when, serbia, s, public, prosecutor, ordered, a, 36, hour, blackout, of, two, independent, media, stations, b92, radio, and, studio, b, television, to, prevent, the, broadcast, of, a, demonstration, against, the, serbian, government, taking, place, in, belgrade, the, two, media, stations, appealed, to, the, public, prosecutor, against, the, ban, but, the, public, prosecutor, failed, to, respond, upon, the, creation, of, the, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, milo, evi, s, government, engaged, in, reforms, to, the, serbian, penal, code, regarding, restrictions, on, free, speech, which, were, seen, by, critics, as, highly, authoritarian, in, particular, article, 98, of, the, serbian, penal, code, during, the, 1990s, punished, imprisonment, of, up, to, three, years, for, the, following, public, ridicule, the, republic, of, serbia, or, another, republic, within, the, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, their, flag, coat, of, arms, or, anthem, their, presidencies, assemblies, or, executive, councils, the, president, of, the, executive, council, in, connection, with, the, performance, of, their, office, the, federal, criminal, code, for, yugoslavia, also, protected, the, presidents, of, federal, institutions, the, yugoslav, army, and, federal, emblems, both, the, serbian, and, federal, yugoslav, laws, granted, limited, exemptions, to, journalists, the, result, was, multiple, charges, against, a, variety, of, people, opposed, to, the, policies, of, the, serbian, and, yugoslav, governments, even, including, a, serbian, cartoonist, who, designed, political, satire, the, hague, indictment, alleges, that, starting, in, 1987, milo, evi, endorsed, a, serbian, nationalist, agenda, and, exploited, a, growing, wave, of, serbian, nationalism, in, order, to, strengthen, centralised, rule, in, the, sfry, icty, prosecutors, argued, that, the, croatia, bosnia, and, kosovo, indictments, were, all, part, of, a, common, scheme, strategy, or, plan, on, the, part, of, the, accused, milo, evi, to, create, a, greater, serbia, a, centralized, serbian, state, encompassing, the, serb, populated, areas, of, croatia, and, bosnia, and, all, of, kosovo, and, that, this, plan, was, to, be, achieved, by, forcibly, removing, non, serbs, from, large, geographical, areas, through, the, commission, of, the, crimes, charged, in, the, indictments, although, the, events, in, kosovo, were, separated, from, those, in, croatia, and, bosnia, by, more, than, three, years, they, were, no, more, than, a, continuation, of, that, plan, and, they, could, only, be, understood, completely, by, reference, to, what, had, happened, in, croatia, and, bosnia, milo, evi, s, defenders, claim, that, the, prosecution, could, not, produce, a, single, order, issued, by, his, government, to, serbian, fighters, in, croatia, or, bosnia, near, the, end, of, the, prosecution, s, case, a, prosecution, analyst, admitted, under, cross, examination, that, this, was, indeed, the, case, reynaud, theunens, however, was, quick, to, point, out, the, fact, that, we, don, t, have, orders, doesn, t, mean, that, they, don, t, exist, to, which, milo, evi, replied, there, are, none, that, s, why, you, haven, t, got, one, milo, evi, s, political, behavior, has, been, analyzed, as, politically, opportunist, in, nature, claims, that, milo, evi, was, principally, motivated, by, a, desire, for, power, have, been, supported, by, many, people, who, had, known, or, had, worked, for, him, some, believe, his, original, goal, until, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, was, to, take, control, of, yugoslavia, with, the, ambition, of, becoming, its, next, great, leader, a, second, tito, according, to, this, milo, evi, exploited, nationalism, as, a, tool, to, seize, power, in, serbia, while, not, holding, any, particular, commitment, to, it, during, the, first, twenty, five, years, of, his, political, career, in, the, communist, government, of, yugoslavia, milo, evi, was, a, typical, civil, servant, who, did, not, appear, to, have, nationalist, aims, later, he, attempted, to, present, himself, as, a, peacemaker, in, the, yugoslav, wars, and, abandoned, support, of, nationalism, he, returned, to, support, nationalism, during, the, kosovo, war, and, appealed, to, anti, imperialist, sentiments, the, spread, of, violent, nationalism, has, also, been, imputed, to, indifference, to, it, by, milo, evi, the, source, of, milo, evi, s, nationalistic, agenda, is, believed, to, have, been, influenced, by, the, policies, of, the, popular, prominent, serbian, communist, official, and, former, yugoslav, partisan, aleksandar, rankovi, who, was, known, to, promote, serbian, national, interests, in, yugoslavia, and, tougher, police, actions, against, ethnic, albanians, in, kosovo, he, supported, a, centralized, yugoslavia, and, opposed, efforts, that, promoted, decentralization, that, he, deemed, to, be, against, the, interests, of, serb, unity, rankovi, imposed, harsh, repressive, measures, on, kosovo, albanians, based, on, accusations, that, they, there, were, sympathizers, of, the, stalinist, rule, of, enver, hoxha, in, albania, in, 1956, a, show, trial, in, pristina, was, held, in, which, multiple, albanian, communists, of, kosovo, were, convicted, of, being, infiltrators, from, albania, and, were, given, long, prison, sentences, rankovi, sought, to, secure, the, position, of, the, serbs, in, kosovo, and, gave, them, dominance, in, kosovo, s, nomenklatura, under, rankovi, s, influence, islam, in, kosovo, at, this, time, was, repressed, and, both, albanians, and, ethnically, slavic, muslims, were, encouraged, to, declare, themselves, to, be, turkish, and, emigrate, to, turkey, at, the, same, time, serbs, and, montenegrins, dominated, the, government, security, forces, and, industrial, employment, in, kosovo, the, popularity, of, rankovi, s, nationalistic, policies, in, serbia, became, apparent, during, his, funeral, in, serbia, in, 1983, where, large, numbers, of, people, attended, while, considering, rankovi, a, serbian, national, leader, this, event, is, believed, to, have, possibly, influenced, milo, evi, who, attended, rankovi, s, funeral, to, recognize, the, popularity, of, rankovi, s, agenda, this, connection, to, the, legacy, of, rankovi, was, recognized, by, a, number, of, yugoslavs, who, regarded, milo, evi, s, policies, upon, his, rise, to, power, in, serbia, as, effectively, bringing, rankovi, back, in, during, the, anti, bureaucratic, revolution, milo, evi, urged, serbians, and, montenegrins, to, take, to, the, streets, and, utilized, the, slogan, strong, serbia, strong, yugoslavia, that, drew, support, from, serbs, and, montenegrins, but, alienated, the, other, yugoslav, nations, to, these, groups, milo, evi, s, agenda, reminded, them, of, the, serb, hegemonic, political, affairs, of, the, kingdom, of, yugoslavia, and, rankovi, s, policies, milo, evi, appealed, to, nationalist, and, populist, passion, by, speaking, of, serbia, s, importance, to, the, world, and, in, a, belgrade, speech, on, 19, november, 1988, he, spoke, of, serbia, as, facing, battles, against, both, internal, and, external, enemies, in, vojvodina, a, mob, of, pro, milo, evi, demonstrators, that, included, 500, kosovo, serbs, and, local, serbs, demonstrated, at, the, provincial, capital, accusing, the, leadership, in, vojvodina, of, supporting, separatism, and, for, being, traitors, in, august, 1988, meetings, by, supporters, of, the, anti, bureaucratic, revolution, were, held, in, many, locations, in, serbia, and, montenegro, with, increasingly, violent, nature, with, calls, being, heard, such, as, give, us, arms, we, want, weapons, long, live, serbia, death, to, albanians, and, montenegro, is, serbia, in, the, same, month, milo, evi, began, efforts, designed, to, destabilize, the, governments, in, montenegro, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, to, allow, him, to, install, his, followers, in, those, republics, by, 1989, milo, evi, and, his, supporters, controlled, central, serbia, along, with, the, autonomous, provinces, of, kosovo, and, vojvodina, supporters, in, the, leadership, of, montenegro, and, agents, of, the, serbian, security, service, were, pursuing, efforts, to, destabilize, the, government, in, bosnia, herzegovina, the, new, government, of, montenegro, led, by, momir, bulatovi, was, seen, by, some, as, a, satellite, of, serbia, in, 1989, the, serbian, media, began, to, speak, of, the, alleged, imperilment, of, the, serbs, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, as, tensions, between, serbs, bosniaks, and, croats, increased, over, serb, support, for, milo, evi, efforts, to, spread, the, cult, of, personality, of, milo, evi, into, the, socialist, republic, of, macedonia, began, in, 1989, with, the, introduction, of, slogans, graffiti, and, songs, glorifying, milo, evi, furthermore, milo, evi, proposed, a, law, to, restore, land, titles, held, by, serbs, in, the, interwar, period, that, effectively, provided, a, legal, basis, for, large, numbers, of, serbs, to, move, to, kosovo, and, macedonia, to, regain, those, lands, beginning, in, 1989, milo, evi, gave, support, to, croatian, serbs, who, were, vouching, for, the, creation, of, an, autonomous, province, for, croatian, serbs, which, was, opposed, by, croatian, communist, authorities, in, the, late, 1980s, milo, evi, allowed, the, mobilization, of, serb, nationalist, organizations, to, go, unhindered, by, actions, from, the, serbian, government, with, chetniks, holding, demonstrations, and, the, serbian, government, embracing, the, serbian, orthodox, church, and, restored, its, legitimacy, in, serbia, croatia, and, slovenia, denounced, milo, evi, s, actions, and, began, to, demand, that, yugoslavia, be, made, a, full, multi, party, confederal, state, milo, evi, claimed, that, he, opposed, a, confederal, system, but, also, declared, that, a, confederal, system, be, created, with, the, external, borders, of, serbia, being, an, open, question, tensions, between, the, republics, escalated, to, crisis, beginning, in, 1988, with, slovenia, accusing, serbia, of, pursuing, stalinism, while, serbia, accused, slovenia, of, betrayal, serbs, boycotted, slovene, products, and, belgraders, began, removing, their, savings, from, the, slovenian, ljubljana, bank, slovenia, accused, serbia, of, persecuting, kosovo, albanians, and, declared, its, solidarity, with, the, kosovo, albanian, people, while, milo, evi, in, turn, accused, slovenia, of, being, a, lackey, of, western, europe, in, response, to, the, escalating, tensions, croatia, expressed, support, for, slovenia, bosnia, and, herzegovina, declared, its, neutrality, while, montenegro, supported, serbia, slovenia, reformed, its, constitution, in, 1989, that, declared, slovenia, s, right, to, secession, these, changes, provoked, accusations, by, the, serbian, media, that, the, changes, were, destabilizing, serbia, s, response, was, a, plan, to, hold, demonstrations, in, ljubljana, with, 30, 000, to, 40, 000, serbs, to, supposedly, inform, slovenes, about, the, situation, in, kosovo, while, this, was, suspected, to, be, an, action, aimed, at, destabilizing, the, slovene, government, croatia, and, slovenia, prevented, the, serb, protesters, from, crossing, by, train, into, slovenia, serbia, responded, by, breaking, political, links, between, the, two, republics, and, 329, serbian, businesses, broke, ties, with, slovenia, with, these, events, in, 1989, nationalism, soared, in, response, along, with, acts, of, intolerance, discrimination, and, ethnic, violence, increasing, in, that, year, officials, from, bosnia, and, herzegovina, noted, rising, tensions, between, bosniaks, croats, and, serbs, active, rumors, spread, of, incidents, between, croats, and, serbs, and, arguments, by, croats, and, serbs, that, bosniaks, were, not, a, real, nation, escalated, with, the, collapse, of, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, multiparty, elections, were, held, in, serbia, in, 1990, with, a, number, of, nationalist, parties, running, on, the, agenda, of, creating, a, greater, serbia, as, yugoslavia, fell, apart, from, 1990, onward, as, serbs, in, croatia, pushed, for, autonomy, and, began, to, arm, themselves, the, serbian, state, run, newspaper, politika, denounced, the, croatian, government, of, franjo, tu, man, for, allegedly, trying, to, restore, the, world, war, ii, era, usta, e, regime, and, for, copying, tito, and, pledged, that, belgrade, would, support, the, serbs, of, croatia, the, yugoslav, people, s, army, jna, began, providing, weapons, to, the, serbs, in, croatia, while, the, situation, in, belgrade, grew, more, intense, as, serbs, demonstrated, outside, of, the, parliament, shouting, we, want, arms, and, let, s, go, to, croatia, milo, evi, and, other, members, of, the, serbian, leadership, in, the, 1980s, attempted, to, gain, support, among, serb, nationalists, by, appealing, to, revisionism, of, the, history, of, yugoslavia, in, world, war, ii, to, do, this, the, tito, era, tradition, of, focusing, on, rallying, the, population, of, yugoslavia, in, remembering, the, total, casualties, of, yugoslavs, in, world, war, ii, at, the, hands, of, axis, forces, was, replaced, with, the, milo, evi, government, s, focus, on, remembering, the, serb, casualties, of, world, war, ii, as, victims, of, the, croatian, usta, e, this, attempt, to, gain, nationalist, support, also, had, the, effect, of, increasing, the, radicalization, of, serbian, nationalism, in, the, late, 1980s, conspiracy, theories, that, vilified, the, roman, catholic, church, began, to, become, widespread, and, were, supported, by, serbian, publishers, this, was, of, particular, significance, since, these, were, attacks, on, the, national, religion, of, the, croats, the, political, climate, in, serbia, and, serb, territories, fostered, the, rise, of, ultranationalism, and, created, tense, and, at, times, violent, confrontations, between, serbs, themselves, particularly, between, nationalist, serbs, and, non, nationalist, serbs, serbs, who, publicly, opposed, the, nationalist, agenda, were, reported, to, have, been, harassed, threatened, or, killed, the, serbian, media, during, milo, evi, s, era, was, known, to, espouse, serb,

the, newspaper, also, attacked, croats, for, the, election, of, franjo, tu, man, as, president, saying, that, the, croatian, leadership, again, shames, the, croatian, people, it, attempted, to, assert, that, croats, and, ethnic, albanians, were, cooperating, in, a, campaign, against, the, serbian, government, during, the, 1991, protests, in, belgrade, against, milo, evi, s, government, denying, that, serbs, took, part, in, the, protest, while, claiming, it, was, the, iptars, and, croats, who, demonstrated, when, war, erupted, in, croatia, politika, promoted, serb, nationalism,

croatia, saying, we, can, t, accept, croatia, keeping, these, borders, krajina, in, the, same, state, with, serbia, montenegro, and, bosnia, herzegovina, and, prominently, quoted, jovan, marjanovi, of, the, serbian, renewal, movement, who, said, the, army, must, come, into, croatia, and, occupy, the, line, benkovac, karlovac, pakrac, baranja, which, would, essentially, have, occupied, almost, all, of, croatia, and, all, the, territories, in, croatia, that, were, claimed, by, nationalist, promoters, of, a, greater, serbia, to, promote, fear, and, anger, among, serbs, towards, croatia, on,

according, to, borisav, jovi, who, was, formerly, a, close, milo, evi, ally, milo, evi, exercised, media, censorship, and, maintained, strong, personal, influence, over, serbia, s, state, media, outlets, having, personally, appointed, editors, in, chief, of, newspapers, and, news, programs, serbian, state, media, during, the, wars, featured, controversial, reportage, that, villainized, the, other, ethnic, factions, in, one, such, program, a, croatian, serb, woman, denounced, the, old, communist, policy, in, croatia, claiming, that, under, it, he, majority, of, serbs, would, be,

have, been, said, to, have, been, examples, of, milo, evi, s, state, media, promoting, fear, mongering, and, utilizing, xenophobic, nationalist, sentiments, to, draw, serbs, to, support, the, wars, the, director, of, radio, television, of, serbia, during, milo, evi, s, era, du, an, mitevi, has, since, admitted, on, a, pbs, documentary, the, things, that, happened, at, state, tv, warmongering, things, we, can, admit, to, now, false, information, biased, reporting, that, went, directly, from, milo, evi, to, the, head, of, tv, milo, evi, was, uninterested, in, maintaining, slovenia, within, the, yugoslav, federation, as, slovenia, had, very, few, serbs, living, within, it, and, milo, evi, suggested, a, political, deal, with, slovene, president, milan, ku, an, serbia, would, recognize, the, right, of, the, self, determination, of, the, slovene, nation, to, independence, if, slovenia, in, turn, recognized, the, right, of, self, determination, of, the, serb, nation, to, remain, united, with, serbia, such, a, deal, would, have, set, a, precedent, for, serbs, in, bosnia, and, croatia, to, remain, in, one, state, with, serbia, milo, evi, s, ally, in, the, yugoslav, federal, government, borisav, jovi, stated, i, put, it, bluntly, we, didn, t, want, a, war, with, slovenia, serbia, had, no, territorial, claims, there, it, was, an, ethnically, pure, republic, no, serbs, we, couldn, t, care, less, if, they, left, yugoslavia, we, would, have, been, overstretched, with, slovenia, out, of, the, way, we, could, dictate, terms, to, the, croats, milo, evi, rejected, the, independence, of, croatia, in, 1991, and, even, after, the, formation, of, the, federal, republic, of, yugoslavia, fry, it, too, did, not, initially, recognize, croatia, s, independence, plans, by, milo, evi, to, carve, out, territory, from, croatia, to, the, local, serbs, had, begun, by, june, 1990, according, to, the, diary, of, borisav, jovi, the, serbian, government, along, with, a, clique, of, pro, milo, evi, members, of, the, yugoslav, army, and, its, general, staff, secretly, adopted, the, ram, or, frame, plan, that, involved, the, partition, of, croatia, and, bosnia, to, give, large, amounts, of, territory, to, the, local, serbs, that, would, remain, united, with, serbia, effectively, a, greater, serbia, armaments, and, military, equipment, were, placed, in, strategic, positions, throughout, croatia, and, bosnia, for, use, by, the, serbs, and, local, serbs, were, trained, as, police, and, paramilitary, soldiers, in, preparation, for, war, milo, evi, was, less, interested, in, annexing, the, serb, breakaway, republic, of, krajina, according, to, testimony, by, krajina, s, former, president, milan, babi, milo, evi, had, abandoned, plans, of, having, all, serbs, in, one, state, by, march, 1991, when, he, met, with, croatian, president, franjo, tu, man, and, discussed, the, partition, of, bosnia, babi, attended, the, meeting, and, noted, that, milo, evi, stated, that, tu, man, needs, biha, a, city, in, bosnia, that, was, separated, by, serbian, krajina, from, croatian, government, controlled, territory, in, croatia, and, then, added, he, needs, a, road, between, benkovac, and, drni, as, well, that, would, involve, the, road, going, through, territory, claimed, by, krajina, upon, the, yugoslav, republic, of, macedonia, seceding, in, 1991, the, yugoslav, government, declared, macedonia, an, artificial, nation, and, it, allied, with, greece, against, the, country, even, suggesting, a, partition, of, the, republic, of, macedonia, between, yugoslavia, and, greece, subsequent, interviews, with, government, officials, involved, in, these, affairs, have, revealed, that, milo, evi, planned, to, arrest, the, republic, of, macedonia, s, political, leadership, and, replace, it, with, politicians, loyal, to, him, milo, evi, demanded, the, self, determination, of, serbs, in, the, republic, of, macedonia, and, did, not, recognize, the, independence, of, the, republic, of, macedonia, until, 1996, despite, the, bitterness, towards, the, macedonian, nation, whose, locals, rejected, yugoslav, assertions, of, serbian, ethnicity, the, fr, yugoslavia, would, recognize, the, republic, of, macedonia, in, 1996, four, years, before, this, milestone, however, yugoslav, troops, and, remnants, of, belgrade, s, central, government, had, peacefully, and, voluntarily, left, macedonian, territory, milo, evi, denounced, the, declaration, of, independence, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, from, yugoslavia, in, 1992, and, said, that, bosnia, and, herzegovina, was, illegally, proclaimed, as, an, independent, state, and, recognized, that, recognition, was, like, when, the, roman, emperor, caligula, appointed, his, horse, as, a, senator, they, recognized, a, state, that, never, existed, before, the, serbs, there, said, we, want, to, stay, within, yugoslavia, we, don, t, want, to, be, second, class, citizens, and, then, the, conflicts, were, started, by, muslims, no, doubt, and, the, serbs, in, defending, themselves, were, always, better, fighters, no, doubt, and, they, achieved, results, no, doubt, but, please, we, were, insisting, on, peace, the, international, community, gave, premature, recognition, first, of, slovenia, and, then, of, croatia, and, supported, the, independence, of, bosnia, and, herzegovina, on, a, totally, irregular, basis, a, telephone, conversation, between, milo, evi, and, bosnian, serb, leader, radovan, karad, i, in, september, 1991, talking, about, the, prospects, of, war, in, bosnia, and, herzegovina, was, tapped, by, yugoslav, intelligence, which, reported, the, transcript, to, yugoslav, prime, minister, ante, markovi, who, released, the, transcript, to, the, public, to, discredit, milo, evi, the, transcript, involved, milo, evi, ordering, karad, i, to, go, to, uzelac, he, ll, tell, you, everything, if, you, have, any, problems, telephone, me, and, said, as, long, as, there, is, the, army, no, one, can, touch, us, don, t, worry, about, herzegovina, momir, said, to, his, men, whoever, is, not, ready, to, die, in, bosnia, step, forward, five, paces, no, one, did, so, the,

buses, all, our, units, were, always, under, the, command, of, the, krajina, or, republika, srpska, army, or, the, jna, of, course, i, don, t, believe, he, signed, anything, these, were, verbal, orders, none, of, our, talks, was, taped, and, i, never, took, a, paper, and, pencil, when, i, talked, with, him, his, key, people, were, the, commanders, nothing, could, happen, on, the, serbian, side, without, milo, evi, s, order, or, his, knowledge, although, direct, orders, to, commit, atrocities, by, milo, evi, have, never, been, discovered, he, made, little, or, no, effort, to, punish, people, deemed, responsible, for, such, atrocities, including, ratko, mladi, who, after, being, accused, of, allowing, atrocities, to, occur, against, croats, in, vukovar, was, sent, to, lead, the, army, of, the, republika, srpska, in, which, capacity, mladi, was, accused, of, ordering, atrocities, including, the, murder, of, thousands, of, bosniak, men, and, boys, in, srebrenica, even, after, the, reports, of, srebrenica, were, released, milo, evi, refused, to, accept, that, mladi, was, responsible, for, the, crimes, he, was, accused, of, wesley, clark, who, was, a, member, of, the, us, team, that, helped, negotiate, the, 1995, dayton, agreement, ending, the, bosnian, war, claimed, in, his, testimony, during, the, trial, of, milo, evi, that, milo, evi, had, prior, knowledge, of, the, srebrenica, massacre, and, knew, of, mladi, s, plans, during, the, negotiations, clark, had, asked, milo, evi, mr, president, you, say, you, have, so, much, influence, over, the, bosnian, serbs, but, how, is, it, then, if, you, have, such, influence, that, you, allowed, general, mladi, to, kill, all, those, people, in, srebrenica, with, milo, evi, answering, well, general, clark, i, warned, mladi, not, to, do, this, but, he, didn, t, listen, to, me, following, the, rise, of, nationalism, and, political, tensions, after, slobodan, milo, evi, came, to, power, as, well, as, the, outbreaks, of, the, yugoslav, wars, numerous, anti, war, movements, developed, in, serbia, the, anti, war, protests, in, belgrade, were, held, mostly, because, of, opposition, the, battle, of, vukovar, siege, of, dubrovnik, and, siege, of, sarajevo, while, protesters, demanded, the, referendum, on, a, declaration, of, war, and, disruption, of, military, conscription, it, is, estimated, that, between, 50, 000, and, 200, 000, people, deserted, from, the, milo, evi, controlled, yugoslav, people, s, army, during, wars, while, between, 100, 000, and, 150, 000, people, emigrated, from, serbia, refusing, to, participate, in, the, war, according, to, professor, renaud, de, la, brosse, senior, lecturer, at, the, university, of, reims, and, a, witness, called, by, the, international, criminal, tribunal, for, the, former, yugoslavia, it, is, surprising, how, great, the, resistance, to, milo, evi, s, propaganda, was, among, serbs, given, that, and, the, lack, of, access, to, alternative, news, political, scientists, orli, fridman, described, that, not, enough, attention, was, given, to, anti, war, activism, among, scholars, studying, the, breakup, of, yugoslavia, and, the, wars, as, well, as, that, independent, media, and, anti, war, groups, from, serbia, did, not, attract, the, international, attention, a, large, number, of, slobodan, milo, evi, s, interviews, have, been, collected, online, by, his, supporters, milo, evi, argued, that, the, yugoslav, constitution, gave, self, determination, to, constitutive, nations, not, to, republics, and, serbs, were, constitutive, nation, in, both, the, socialistic, republic, of, croatia, and, the, socialistic, republic, of, bosnia, herzegovina, on, this, basis, he, stated, that, the, croatian, serbs, and, later, the, bosnian, serbs, should, not, have, been, subject, to, the, declarations, of, independence, by, the, yugoslav, republics, of, croatia, and, bosnia, and, herzegovina, milo, evi, denied, that, serbia, was, at, war, even, though, serbia, s, military, involvement, was, evident, during, the, wars, in, slovenia, croatia, and, bosnia, in, particular, milo, evi, was, president, of, serbia, not, of, yugoslavia, and, claims, that, his, government, was, only, indirectly, involved, through, support, for, serbs, in, croatia, and, bosnia, at, some, points, others, including, former, members, of, his, cabinet, such, as, borisav, jovi, have, admitted, that, milo, evi, while, not, head, of, state, of, yugoslavia, in, the, early, 1990s, in, fact, played, a, key, role, in, the, military, affairs, taken, in, slovenia, croatia, and, bosnia, this, included, a, scheme, discussed, and, designed, by, both, jovi, and, milo, evi, that, transferred, every, bosnian, serb, unit, from, the, yugoslav, army, jna, to, the, newly, formed, bosnian, serb, army, upon, bosnia, s, separation, from, yugoslavia, which, meant, that, yugoslavia, could, not, be, criticized, for, occupying, parts, of, bosnia, as, it, was, officially, a, civil, war, although, jovi, admitted, that, the, bosnian, serb, army, was, fully, funded, by, belgrade, because, the, bosnian, serb, military, budget, was, too, small, to, support, such, an, army, milo, evi, spent, most, of, 1988, and, 1989, focusing, his, politics, on, the, kosovo, problem, in, kosovo, to, seem, non, contradictory, milo, evi, alleged, that, he, supported, the, right, of, the, albanians, to, self, determination, but, not, to, independence, as, he, claimed, that, kosovo, was, an, essential, part, of, serbia, due, to, its, history, and, its, numerous, churches, and, cultural, relics, he, also, claimed, that, the, kla, were, a, neo, nazi, organisation, that, sought, an, ethnically, pure, kosovo, and, he, argued, that, independence, would, deliver, kosovo, to, their, hands, milo, evi, denied, that, he, gave, orders, to, massacre, albanians, in, 1998, he, claimed, that, the, deaths, were, sporadic, events, confined, to, rural, areas, of, west, kosovo, committed, by, paramilitaries, and, by, rebels, in, the, armed, forces, those, from, the, serbian, army, or, police, who, were, involved, were, all, he, claimed, arrested, and, many, were, given, long, prison, sentences, the, former, united, states, ambassador, to, yugoslavia, warren, zimmermann, during, his, conversations, with, milo, evi, claimed, that, he, was, not, a, genuine, nationalist, but, rather, a, political, opportunist, zimmerman, has, claimed, that, unlike, other, politicians, with, whom, he, had, discussions, during, the, collapse, of, yugoslavia, such, as, franjo, tu, man, and, radovan, karad, i, milo, evi, did, not, emphasize, any, hatred, of, ethnic, groups, and, instead, emphasized, that, serbia, would, continue, to, be, a, multi, ethnic, republic, in, yugoslavia, zimmerman, has, claimed, that, milo, evi, opportunistically, used, nationalism, to, allow, him, to, rise, to, power, in, the, communist, establishment, in, serbia, as, communism, in, eastern, europe, became, increasingly, unpopular, and, continued, to, advocate, a, nationalist, agenda, to, draw, in, support, for, his, government, on, another, occasion, however, milo, evi, revealed, to, zimmerman, his, negative, attitude, towards, ethnic, albanians, who, had, demanded, autonomy, and, in, the, 1990s, independence, from, serbia, and, yugoslavia, milo, evi, told, zimmerman, jokingly, that, the, albanians, of, kosovo, were, the, most, pampered, minority, in, europe, milo, evi, also, was, known, to, talk, disparagingly, about, slovenes, when, he, in, conversation, with, an, interviewer, of, what, he, thought, of, the, slovene, delegation, s, decision, to, depart, the, league, of, communists, of, yugoslavia, milo, evi, made, a, derogatory, joke, calling, the, league, of, communists, of, slovenia, delegation, those, stingy, slovenes, zimmerman, later, reported, that, milo, evi, s, unusual, and, conflicting, positions, and, mannerisms, were, almost, schizophrenic, in, nature, as, at, times, milo, evi, would, behave, in, an, arrogant, stubborn, authoritarian, and, aggressive, manner, towards, others, which, staunchly, supported, serbian, nationalism, against, all, opponents, while, at, other, times, he, would, be, polite, conciliatory, and, be, eager, and, willing, to, find, moderate, and, peaceful, solutions, to, the, crisis, in, yugoslavia, zimmerman, has, concluded, however, that, milo, evi, constantly, demonstrated, that, he, primarily, saw, yugoslavia, as, a, state, for, ensuring, the, unity, of, serbs, and, did, not, have, much, interest, in, preserving, the, unity, of, yugoslavia, outside, areas, of, serb, national, interests, milo, evi, s, personality, according, to, others, indicated, a, similar, double, sided, nature, as, u, s, ambassador, zimmerman, has, claimed, in, public, appearances, he, would, appear, strong, confident, bold, and, serious, while, in, private, it, is, said, that, milo, evi, was, very, laid, back, and, according, to, the, former, director, of, politika, had, i, dragan, anti, milo, evi, was, often, interested, in, non, political, things, such, as, comic, strips, and, disney, cartoons, and, admired, the, music, of, frank, sinatra, milo, evi, only, allowed, a, close, inner, circle, of, personal, friends, to, visit, him, while, others, including, the, former, information, minister, of, serbia, during, milo, evi, s, era, aleksandar, tijani, have, said, that, in, private, milo, evi, demonstrated, elements, of, paranoia, to, many, people, outside, of, his, inner, circle, such, as, demanding, that, tijani, remove, the, battery, from, his, mobile, phone, on, each, occasion, that, tijani, met, him, milo, evi, also, refused, to, keep, notes, on, talks, on, important, issues, and, would, only, meet, with, his, most, trusted, allies, to, whom, he, simply, gave, directions, and, instructions, without, engaging, in, substantial, discussion, in, the, summer, of, 2000, former, serbian, president, ivan, stamboli, was, kidnapped, his, body, was, found, in, 2003, and, milo, evi, was, charged, with, ordering, his, murder, in, 2005, several, members, of, the, serbian, secret, police, and, criminal, gangs, were, convicted, in, belgrade, for, a, number, of, murders, including, stamboli, s, these, were, the, same, people, who, arrested, milo, evi, in, april, 2001, in, june, 2006, the, supreme, court, of, serbia, ruled, that, milo, evi, had, ordered, the, murder, of, stamboli, accepting, the, previous, ruling, of, the, special, court, for, organized, crime, in, belgrade, which, targeted, milo, evi, as, the, main, abettor, of, politically, motivated, murders, in, the, 1990s, milo, evi, s, attorneys, said, the, court, s, ruling, was, of, little, value, because, he, was, never, formally, charged, or, given, an, opportunity, to, defend, himself, against, the, accusations, moreover, most, of, these, murders, were, of, government, officials, such, as, high, police, official, radovan, stoji, i, defence, minister, pavle, bulatovi, and, the, director, of, jat, airways, ika, petrovi, on, 4, february, 1997, milo, evi, recognized, the, opposition, victories, in, some, local, elections, after, mass, protests, lasting, 96, days, constitutionally, limited, to, two, terms, as, president, of, serbia, on, 23, july, 1997, milo, evi, assumed, the, presidency, of, the, federation, though, it, had, been, understood, he, had, held, the, real, power, for, some, time, before, then, serbian, police, and, military, counter, action, against, the, pro, albanian, separatist, kosovo, liberation, army, in, serbia, s, previously, autonomous, province, of, kosovo, culminated, in, escalating, armed, conflict, in, 1998, and, nato, air, strikes, against, yugoslavia, between, march, and, june, 1999, ending, in, full, withdrawal, of, yugoslav, security, forces, from, the, province, and, deployment, of, international, civil, and, security, forces, milo, evi, was, indicted, on, 24, may, 1999, for,

icty, he, asserted, that, the, trial, was, illegal, having, been, established, in, contravention, of, the, un, charter, ironically, milo, evi, lost, his, grip, on, power, when, he, lost, elections, that, he, scheduled, prematurely, that, is, before, the, end, of, his, mandate, and, that, he, did, not, even, need, to, win, in, order, to, retain, power, which, was, centered, in, the, parliaments, that, his, party, and, its, associates, controlled, in, the, five, man, presidential, race, held, on, 24, september, 2000, milo, evi, was, defeated, in, the, first, round, by, opposition, leader, vojislav, ko, tunica, who, won, slightly, more, than, 50, of, the, vote, milo, evi, initially, refused, to, acquiesce, claiming, that, no, one, had, won, a, majority, the, yugoslav, constitution, called, for, a, runoff, between, the, top, two, candidates, in, the, event, that, no, candidate, won, more, than, 50, of, the, vote, official, results, put, ko, tunica, ahead, of, milo, evi, but, at, under, 50, percent, the, internationally, financed, cesid, claimed, otherwise, though, its, story, changed, throughout, the, two, weeks, between, 24, september, and, 5, october, this, led, to, mass, demonstrations, in, belgrade, on, 5, october, known, as, the, bulldozer, revolution, milo, evi, was, forced, to, accept, this, when, yugoslav, army, commanders, he, had, expected, to, support, him, had, indicated, that, in, this, instance, they, would, not, and, would, permit, the, violent, overthrow, of, the, serbian, government, on, 6, october, milo, evi, met, with, ko, tunica, and, publicly,
