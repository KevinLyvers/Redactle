james, prescott, joule, frs, frse, d, u, l, 24, december, 1818, 11, october, 1889, was, an, english, physicist, mathematician, and, brewer, born, in, salford, lancashire, joule, studied, the, nature, of, heat, and, discovered, its, relationship, to, mechanical, work, this, led, to, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, which, in, turn, led, to, the, development, of, the, first, law, of, thermodynamics, the, si, derived, unit, of, energy, the, joule, is, named, after, him, he, worked, with, lord, kelvin, to, develop, an, absolute, thermodynamic, temperature, scale, which, came, to, be, called, the, kelvin, scale, joule, also, made, observations, of, magnetostriction, and, he, found, the, relationship, between, the, current, through, a, resistor, and, the, heat, dissipated, which, is, also, called, joule, s, first, law, his, experiments, about, energy, transformations, were, first, published, in, 1843, james, joule, was, born, in, 1818, the, son, of, benjamin, joule, 1784, 1858, a, wealthy, brewer, and, his, wife, alice, prescott, on, new, bailey, street, in, salford, joule, was, tutored, as, a, young, man, by, the, famous, scientist, john, dalton, and, was, strongly, influenced, by, chemist, william, henry, and, manchester, engineers, peter, ewart, and, eaton, hodgkinson, he, was, fascinated, by, electricity, and, he, and, his, brother, experimented, by, giving, electric, shocks, to, each, other, and, to, the, family, s, servants, as, an, adult, joule, managed, the, brewery, science, was, merely, a, serious, hobby, sometime, around, 1840, he, started, to, investigate, the, feasibility, of, replacing, the, brewery, s, steam, engines, with, the, newly, invented, electric, motor, his, first, scientific, papers, on, the, subject, were, contributed, to, william, sturgeon, s, annals, of, electricity, joule, was, a, member, of, the, london, electrical, society, established, by, sturgeon, and, others, motivated, in, part, by, a, businessman, s, desire, to, quantify, the, economics, of, the, choice, and, in, part, by, his, scientific, inquisitiveness, he, set, out, to, determine, which, prime, mover, was, more, efficient, he, discovered, joule, s, first, law, in, 1841, that, the, heat, which, is, evolved, by, the, proper, action, of, any, voltaic, current, is, proportional, to, the, square, of, the, intensity, of, that, current, multiplied, by, the, resistance, to, conduction, which, it, experiences, he, went, on, to, realize, that, burning, a, pound, of, coal, in, a, steam, engine, was, more, economical, than, a, costly, pound, of, zinc, consumed, in, an, electric, battery, joule, captured, the, output, of, the, alternative, methods, in, terms, of, a, common, standard, the, ability, to, raise, a, mass, weighing, one, pound, to, a, height, of, one, foot, the, foot, pound, however, joule, s, interest, diverted, from, the, narrow, financial, question, to, that, of, how, much, work, could, be, extracted, from, a, given, source, leading, him, to, speculate, about, the, convertibility, of, energy, in, 1843, he, published, results, of, experiments, showing, that, the, heating, effect, he, had, quantified, in, 1841, was, due, to, generation, of, heat, in, the, conductor, and, not, its, transfer, from, another, part, of, the, equipment, this, was, a, direct, challenge, to, the, caloric, theory, which, held, that, heat, could, neither, be, created, nor, destroyed, caloric, theory, had, dominated, thinking, in, the, science, of, heat, since, introduced, by, antoine, lavoisier, in, 1783, lavoisier, s, prestige, and, the, practical, success, of, sadi, carnot, s, caloric, theory, of, the, heat, engine, since, 1824, ensured, that, the, young, joule, working, outside, either, academia, or, the, engineering, profession, had, a, difficult, road, ahead, supporters, of, the, caloric, theory, readily, pointed, to, the, symmetry, of, the, peltier, seebeck, effect, to, claim, that, heat, and, current, were, convertible, in, an, at, least, approximately, reversible, process, further, experiments, and, measurements, with, his, electric, motor, led, joule, to, estimate, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, as, 4, 1868, joules, per, calorie, of, work, to, raise, the, temperature, of, one, gram, of, water, by, one, kelvin, he, announced, his, results, at, a, meeting, of, the, chemical, section, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, cork, in, august, 1843, and, was, met, by, silence, joule, was, undaunted, and, started, to, seek, a, purely, mechanical, demonstration, of, the, conversion, of, work, into, heat, by, forcing, water, through, a, perforated, cylinder, he, could, measure, the, slight, viscous, heating, of, the, fluid, he, obtained, a, mechanical, equivalent, of, 770, foot, pounds, force, per, british, thermal, unit, 4, 140, j, cal, the, fact, that, the, values, obtained, both, by, electrical, and, purely, mechanical, means, were, in, agreement, to, at, least, two, significant, digits, was, to, joule, compelling, evidence, of, the, reality, of, the, convertibility, of, work, into, heat, wherever, mechanical, force, is, expended, an, exact, equivalent, of, heat, is, always, obtained, joule, now, tried, a, third, route, he, measured, the, heat, generated, against, the, work, done, in, compressing, a, gas, he, obtained, a, mechanical, equivalent, of, 798, foot, pounds, force, per, british, thermal, unit, 4, 290, j, cal, in, many, ways, this, experiment, offered, the, easiest, target, for, joule, s, critics, but, joule, disposed, of, the, anticipated, objections, by, clever, experimentation, joule, read, his, paper, to, the, royal, society, on, 20, june, 1844, but, his, paper, was, rejected, for, publication, by, the, royal, society, and, he, had, to, be, content, with, publishing, in, the, philosophical, magazine, in, 1845, in, the, paper, he, was, forthright, in, his, rejection, of, the, caloric, reasoning, of, carnot, and, mile, clapeyron, a, rejection, partly, theologically, driven, i, conceive, that, this, theory, is, opposed, to, the, recognised, principles, of, philosophy, because, it, leads, to, the, conclusion, that, vis, viva, may, be, destroyed, by, an, improper, disposition, of, the, apparatus, thus, mr, clapeyron, draws, the, inference, that, the, temperature, of, the, fire, being, 1000, c, to, 2000, c, higher, than, that, of, the, boiler, there, is, an, enormous, loss, of, vis, viva, in, the, passage, of, the, heat, from, the, furnace, to, the, boiler, believing, that, the, power, to, destroy, belongs, to, the, creator, alone, i, affirm, that, any, theory, which, when, carried, out, demands, the, annihilation, of, force, is, necessarily, erroneous, joule, here, adopts, the, language, of, vis, viva, energy, possibly, because, hodgkinson, had, read, a, review, of, ewart, s, on, the, measure, of, moving, force, to, the, literary, and, philosophical, society, in, april, 1844, in, june, 1845, joule, read, his, paper, on, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, to, the, british, association, meeting, in, cambridge, in, this, work, he, reported, his, best, known, experiment, involving, the, use, of, a, falling, weight, in, which, gravity, does, the, mechanical, work, to, spin, a, paddle, wheel, in, an, insulated, barrel, of, water, which, increased, the, temperature, he, now, estimated, a, mechanical, equivalent, of, 819, foot, pounds, force, per, british, thermal, unit, 4, 404, j, cal, he, wrote, a, letter, to, the, philosophical, magazine, published, in, september, 1845, describing, his, experiment, in, 1850, joule, published, a, refined, measurement, of, 772, 692, foot, pounds, force, per, british, thermal, unit, 4, 150, j, cal, closer, to, twentieth, century, estimates, much, of, the, initial, resistance, to, joule, s, work, stemmed, from, its, dependence, upon, extremely, precise, measurements, he, claimed, to, be, able, to, measure, temperatures, to, within, 1, 200, of, a, degree, fahrenheit, 3, mk, such, precision, was, certainly, uncommon, in, contemporary, experimental, physics, but, his, doubters, may, have, neglected, his, experience, in, the, art, of, brewing, and, his, access, to, its, practical, technologies, he, was, also, ably, supported, by, scientific, instrument, maker, john, benjamin, dancer, joule, s, experiments, complemented, the, theoretical, work, of, rudolf, clausius, who, is, considered, by, some, to, be, the, coinventor, of, the, energy, concept, joule, was, proposing, a, kinetic, theory, of, heat, he, believed, it, to, be, a, form, of, rotational, rather, than, translational, kinetic, energy, and, this, required, a, conceptual, leap, if, heat, was, a, form, of, molecular, motion, why, did, the, motion, of, the, molecules, not, gradually, die, out, joule, s, ideas, required, one, to, believe, that, the, collisions, of, molecules, were, perfectly, elastic, importantly, the, very, existence, of, atoms, and, molecules, was, not, widely, accepted, for, another, 50, years, although, it, may, be, hard, today, to, understand, the, allure, of, the, caloric, theory, at, the, time, it, seemed, to, have, some, clear, advantages, carnot, s, successful, theory, of, heat, engines, had, also, been, based, on, the, caloric, assumption, and, only, later, was, it, proved, by, lord, kelvin, that, carnot, s, mathematics, were, equally, valid, without, assuming, a, caloric, fluid, however, in, germany, hermann, helmholtz, became, aware, both, of, joule, s, work, and, the, similar, 1842, work, of, julius, robert, von, mayer, though, both, men, had, been, neglected, since, their, respective, publications, helmholtz, s, definitive, 1847, declaration, of, the, conservation, of, energy, credited, them, both, also, in, 1847, another, of, joule, s, presentations, at, the, british, association, in, oxford, was, attended, by, george, gabriel, stokes, michael, faraday, and, the, precocious, and, maverick, william, thomson, later, to, become, lord, kelvin, who, had, just, been, appointed, professor, of, natural, philosophy, at, the, university, of, glasgow, stokes, was, inclined, to, be, a, joulite, and, faraday, was, much, struck, with, it, though, he, harboured, doubts, thomson, was, intrigued, but, sceptical, unanticipated, thomson, and, joule, met, later, that, year, in, chamonix, joule, married, amelia, grimes, on, 18, august, and, the, couple, went, on, honeymoon, marital, enthusiasm, notwithstanding, joule, and, thomson, arranged, to, attempt, an, experiment, a, few, days, later, to, measure, the, temperature, difference, between, the, top, and, bottom, of, the, cascade, de, sallanches, waterfall, though, this, subsequently, proved, impractical, though, thomson, felt, that, joule, s, results, demanded, theoretical, explanation, he, retreated, into, a, spirited, defence, of, the, carnot, clapeyron, school, in, his, 1848, account, of, absolute, temperature, thomson, wrote, that, the, conversion, of, heat, or, caloric, into, mechanical, effect, is, probably, impossible, certainly, undiscovered, but, a, footnote, signalled, his, first, doubts, about, the, caloric, theory, referring, to, joule, s, very, remarkable, discoveries, surprisingly, thomson, did, not, send, joule, a, copy, of, his, paper, but, when, joule, eventually, read, it, he, wrote, to, thomson, on, 6, october, claiming, that, his, studies, had, demonstrated, conversion, of, heat, into, work, but, that, he, was, planning, further, experiments, thomson, replied, on, the, 27th, revealing, that, he, was, planning, his, own, experiments, and, hoping, for, a, reconciliation, of, their, two, views, though, thomson, conducted, no, new, experiments, over, the, next, two, years, he, became, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, carnot, s, theory, and, convinced, of, joule, s, in, his, 1851, paper, thomson, was, willing, to, go, no, further, than, a, compromise, and, declared, the, whole, theory, of, the, motive, power, of, heat, is, founded, on, two, propositions, due, respectively, to, joule, and, to, carnot, and, clausius, as, soon, as, joule, read, the, paper, he, wrote, to, thomson, with, his, comments, and, questions, thus, began, a, fruitful, though, largely, epistolary, collaboration, between, the, two, men, joule, conducting, experiments, thomson, analysing, the, results, and, suggesting, further, experiments, the, collaboration, lasted, from, 1852, to, 1856, its, discoveries, including, the, joule, thomson, effect, and, the, published, results, did, much, to, bring, about, general, acceptance, of, joule, s, work, and, the, kinetic, theory, kinetics, is, the, science, of, motion, joule, was, a, pupil, of, dalton, and, it, is, no, surprise, that, he, had, learned, a, firm, belief, in, the, atomic, theory, even, though, there, were, many, scientists, of, his, time, who, were, still, skeptical, he, had, also, been, one, of, the, few, people, receptive, to, the, neglected, work, of, john, herapath, on, the, kinetic, theory, of, gases, he, was, further, profoundly, influenced, by, peter, ewart, s, 1813, paper, on, the, measure, of, moving, force, joule, perceived, the, relationship, between, his, discoveries, and, the, kinetic, theory, of, heat, his, laboratory, notebooks, reveal, that, he, believed, heat, to, be, a, form, of, rotational, rather, than, translational, motion, joule, could, not, resist, finding, antecedents, of, his, views, in, francis, bacon, sir, isaac, newton, john, locke, benjamin, thompson, count, rumford, and, sir, humphry, davy, though, such, views, are, justified, joule, went, on, to, estimate, a, value, for, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, of, 1, 034, foot, pound, from, rumford, s, publications, some, modern, writers, have, criticised, this, approach, on, the, grounds, that, rumford, s, experiments, in, no, way, represented, systematic, quantitative, measurements, in, one, of, his, personal, notes, joule, contends, that, mayer, s, measurement, was, no, more, accurate, than, rumford, s, perhaps, in, the, hope, that, mayer, had, not, anticipated, his, own, work, joule, has, been, attributed, with, explaining, the, sunset, green, flash, phenomenon, in, a, letter, to, the, manchester, literary, and, philosophical, society, in, 1869, actually, he, merely, noted, with, a, sketch, the, last, glimpse, as, bluish, green, without, attempting, to, explain, the, cause, of, the, phenomenon, joule, died, at, home, in, sale, and, is, buried, in, brooklands, cemetery, there, his, gravestone, is, inscribed, with, the, number, 772, 55, his, climacteric, 1878, measurement, of, the, mechanical, equivalent, of, heat, in, which, he, found, that, this, amount, of, foot, pounds, of, work, must, be, expended, at, sea, level, to, raise, the, temperature, of, one, pound, of, water, from, 60, f, to, 61, f, there, is, also, a, quotation, from, the, gospel, of, john, i, must, work, the, work, of, him, that, sent, me, while, it, is, day, the, night, cometh, when, no, man, can, work, the, wetherspoon, s, pub, in, sale, the, town, of, his, death, is, named, the, j, p, joule, after, him, joule, s, many, honours, and, commendations, include, there, is, a, memorial, to, joule, in, the, north, choir, aisle, of, westminster, abbey, though, he, is, not, buried, there, contrary, to, what, some, biographies, state, a, statue, of, joule, by, alfred, gilbert, stands, in, manchester, town, hall, opposite, that, of, dalton, joule, married, amelia, grimes, in, 1847, she, died, in, 1854, seven, years, after, their, wedding, they, had, three, children, together, a, son, benjamin, arthur, joule, 1850, 1922, a, daughter, alice, amelia, 1852, 1899, and, a, second, son, joe, born, 1854, died, three, weeks, later
