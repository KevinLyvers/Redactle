enrico, fermi, formemrs, italian, 29, september, 1901, 28, november, 1954, was, an, italian, and, naturalized, american, physicist, renowned, for, being, the, creator, of, the, world, s, first, artificial, nuclear, reactor, the, chicago, pile, 1, and, a, member, of, the, manhattan, project, he, has, been, called, the, architect, of, the, nuclear, age, and, the, architect, of, the, atomic, bomb, he, was, one, of, very, few, physicists, to, excel, in, both, theoretical, physics, and, experimental, physics, fermi, was, awarded, the, 1938, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, work, on, induced, radioactivity, by, neutron, bombardment, and, for, the, discovery, of, transuranium, elements, with, his, colleagues, fermi, filed, several, patents, related, to, the, use, of, nuclear, power, all, of, which, were, taken, over, by, the, us, government, he, made, significant, contributions, to, the, development, of, statistical, mechanics, quantum, theory, and, nuclear, and, particle, physics, fermi, s, first, major, contribution, involved, the, field, of, statistical, mechanics, after, wolfgang, pauli, formulated, his, exclusion, principle, in, 1925, fermi, followed, with, a, paper, in, which, he, applied, the, principle, to, an, ideal, gas, employing, a, statistical, formulation, now, known, as, fermi, dirac, statistics, today, particles, that, obey, the, exclusion, principle, are, called, fermions, pauli, later, postulated, the, existence, of, an, uncharged, invisible, particle, emitted, along, with, an, electron, during, beta, decay, to, satisfy, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, fermi, took, up, this, idea, developing, a, model, that, incorporated, the, postulated, particle, which, he, named, the, neutrino, his, theory, later, referred, to, as, fermi, s, interaction, and, now, called, weak, interaction, described, one, of, the, four, fundamental, interactions, in, nature, through, experiments, inducing, radioactivity, with, the, recently, discovered, neutron, fermi, discovered, that, slow, neutrons, were, more, easily, captured, by, atomic, nuclei, than, fast, ones, and, he, developed, the, fermi, age, equation, to, describe, this, after, bombarding, thorium, and, uranium, with, slow, neutrons, he, concluded, that, he, had, created, new, elements, although, he, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, this, discovery, the, new, elements, were, later, revealed, to, be, nuclear, fission, products, fermi, left, italy, in, 1938, to, escape, new, italian, racial, laws, that, affected, his, jewish, wife, laura, capon, he, emigrated, to, the, united, states, where, he, worked, on, the, manhattan, project, during, world, war, ii, fermi, led, the, team, at, the, university, of, chicago, that, designed, and, built, chicago, pile, 1, which, went, critical, on, 2, december, 1942, demonstrating, the, first, human, created, self, sustaining, nuclear, chain, reaction, he, was, on, hand, when, the, x, 10, graphite, reactor, at, oak, ridge, tennessee, went, critical, in, 1943, and, when, the, b, reactor, at, the, hanford, site, did, so, the, next, year, at, los, alamos, he, headed, f, division, part, of, which, worked, on, edward, teller, s, thermonuclear, super, bomb, he, was, present, at, the, trinity, test, on, 16, july, 1945, the, first, test, of, a, full, nuclear, bomb, explosion, where, he, used, his, fermi, method, to, estimate, the, bomb, s, yield, after, the, war, he, helped, establish, the, institute, for, nuclear, studies, at, chicago, and, served, on, the, general, advisory, committee, chaired, by, j, robert, oppenheimer, which, advised, the, atomic, energy, commission, on, nuclear, matters, after, the, detonation, of, the, first, soviet, fission, bomb, in, august, 1949, he, strongly, opposed, the, development, of, a, hydrogen, bomb, on, both, moral, and, technical, grounds, he, was, among, the, scientists, who, testified, on, oppenheimer, s, behalf, at, the, 1954, hearing, that, resulted, in, the, denial, of, oppenheimer, s, security, clearance, fermi, did, important, work, in, particle, physics, especially, related, to, pions, and, muons, and, he, speculated, that, cosmic, rays, arose, when, material, was, accelerated, by, magnetic, fields, in, interstellar, space, many, awards, concepts, and, institutions, are, named, after, fermi, including, the, fermi, 1, breeder, reactor, the, enrico, fermi, nuclear, generating, station, the, enrico, fermi, award, the, enrico, fermi, institute, the, fermi, national, accelerator, laboratory, fermilab, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, the, fermi, paradox, and, the, synthetic, element, fermium, making, him, one, of, 16, scientists, who, have, elements, named, after, them, enrico, fermi, was, born, in, rome, italy, on, 29, september, 1901, he, was, the, third, child, of, alberto, fermi, a, division, head, in, the, ministry, of, railways, and, ida, de, gattis, an, elementary, school, teacher, his, sister, maria, was, two, years, older, his, brother, giulio, a, year, older, after, the, two, boys, were, sent, to, a, rural, community, to, be, wet, nursed, enrico, rejoined, his, family, in, rome, when, he, was, two, and, a, half, although, he, was, baptized, a, roman, catholic, in, accordance, with, his, grandparents, wishes, his, family, was, not, particularly, religious, enrico, was, an, agnostic, throughout, his, adult, life, as, a, young, boy, he, shared, the, same, interests, as, his, brother, giulio, building, electric, motors, and, playing, with, electrical, and, mechanical, toys, giulio, died, during, an, operation, on, a, throat, abscess, in, 1915, and, maria, died, in, an, airplane, crash, near, milan, in, 1959, at, a, local, market, in, campo, de, fiori, fermi, found, a, physics, book, the, 900, page, elementorum, physicae, mathematicae, written, in, latin, by, jesuit, father, andrea, caraffa, a, professor, at, the, collegio, romano, it, presented, mathematics, classical, mechanics, astronomy, optics, and, acoustics, as, they, were, understood, at, the, time, of, its, 1840, publication, with, a, scientifically, inclined, friend, enrico, persico, fermi, pursued, projects, such, as, building, gyroscopes, and, measuring, the, acceleration, of, earth, s, gravity, in, 1914, fermi, who, used, to, often, meet, with, his, father, in, front, of, the, office, after, work, met, a, colleague, of, his, father, called, adolfo, amidei, who, would, walk, part, of, the, way, home, with, alberto, enrico, had, learned, that, adolfo, was, interested, in, mathematics, and, physics, and, took, the, opportunity, to, ask, adolfo, a, question, about, geometry, adolfo, understood, that, the, young, fermi, was, referring, to, projective, geometry, and, then, proceeded, to, give, him, a, book, on, the, subject, written, by, theodor, reye, two, months, later, fermi, returned, the, book, having, solved, all, the, problems, proposed, at, the, end, of, the, book, some, of, which, adolfo, considered, difficult, upon, verifying, this, adolfo, felt, that, fermi, was, a, prodigy, at, least, with, respect, to, geometry, and, further, mentored, the, boy, providing, him, with, more, books, on, physics, and, mathematics, adolfo, noted, that, fermi, had, a, very, good, memory, and, thus, could, return, the, books, after, having, read, them, because, he, could, remember, their, content, very, well, fermi, graduated, from, high, school, in, july, 1918, having, skipped, the, third, year, entirely, at, amidei, s, urging, fermi, learned, german, to, be, able, to, read, the, many, scientific, papers, that, were, published, in, that, language, at, the, time, and, he, applied, to, the, scuola, normale, superiore, in, pisa, amidei, felt, that, the, scuola, would, provide, better, conditions, for, fermi, s, development, than, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, could, at, the, time, having, lost, one, son, fermi, s, parents, only, reluctantly, allowed, him, to, live, in, the, school, s, lodgings, away, from, rome, for, four, years, fermi, took, first, place, in, the, difficult, entrance, exam, which, included, an, essay, on, the, theme, of, specific, characteristics, of, sounds, the, 17, year, old, fermi, chose, to, use, fourier, analysis, to, derive, and, solve, the, partial, differential, equation, for, a, vibrating, rod, and, after, interviewing, fermi, the, examiner, declared, he, would, become, an, outstanding, physicist, at, the, scuola, normale, superiore, fermi, played, pranks, with, fellow, student, franco, rasetti, the, two, became, close, friends, and, collaborators, fermi, was, advised, by, luigi, puccianti, director, of, the, physics, laboratory, who, said, there, was, little, he, could, teach, fermi, and, often, asked, fermi, to, teach, him, something, instead, fermi, s, knowledge, of, quantum, physics, was, such, that, puccianti, asked, him, to, organize, seminars, on, the, topic, during, this, time, fermi, learned, tensor, calculus, a, technique, key, to, general, relativity, fermi, initially, chose, mathematics, as, his, major, but, soon, switched, to, physics, he, remained, largely, self, taught, studying, general, relativity, quantum, mechanics, and, atomic, physics, in, september, 1920, fermi, was, admitted, to, the, physics, department, since, there, were, only, three, students, in, the, department, fermi, rasetti, and, nello, carrara, puccianti, let, them, freely, use, the, laboratory, for, whatever, purposes, they, chose, fermi, decided, that, they, should, research, x, ray, crystallography, and, the, three, worked, to, produce, a, laue, photograph, an, x, ray, photograph, of, a, crystal, during, 1921, his, third, year, at, the, university, fermi, published, his, first, scientific, works, in, the, italian, journal, nuovo, cimento, the, first, was, entitled, on, the, dynamics, of, a, rigid, system, of, electrical, charges, in, translational, motion, sulla, dinamica, di, un, sistema, rigido, di, cariche, elettriche, in, moto, traslatorio, a, sign, of, things, to, come, was, that, the, mass, was, expressed, as, a, tensor, a, mathematical, construct, commonly, used, to, describe, something, moving, and, changing, in, three, dimensional, space, in, classical, mechanics, mass, is, a, scalar, quantity, but, in, relativity, it, changes, with, velocity, the, second, paper, was, on, the, electrostatics, of, a, uniform, gravitational, field, of, electromagnetic, charges, and, on, the, weight, of, electromagnetic, charges, sull, elettrostatica, di, un, campo, gravitazionale, uniforme, e, sul, peso, delle, masse, elettromagnetiche, using, general, relativity, fermi, showed, that, a, charge, has, a, weight, equal, to, u, c, 2, where, u, was, the, electrostatic, energy, of, the, system, and, c, is, the, speed, of, light, the, first, paper, seemed, to, point, out, a, contradiction, between, the, electrodynamic, theory, and, the, relativistic, one, concerning, the, calculation, of, the, electromagnetic, masses, as, the, former, predicted, a, value, of, 4, 3, u, c, 2, fermi, addressed, this, the, next, year, in, a, paper, concerning, a, contradiction, between, electrodynamic, and, the, relativistic, theory, of, electromagnetic, mass, in, which, he, showed, that, the, apparent, contradiction, was, a, consequence, of, relativity, this, paper, was, sufficiently, well, regarded, that, it, was, translated, into, german, and, published, in, the, german, scientific, journal, physikalische, zeitschrift, in, 1922, that, year, fermi, submitted, his, article, on, the, phenomena, occurring, near, a, world, line, sopra, i, fenomeni, che, avvengono, in, vicinanza, di, una, linea, oraria, to, the, italian, journal, i, rendiconti, dell, accademia, dei, lincei, in, this, article, he, examined, the, principle, of, equivalence, and, introduced, the, so, called, fermi, coordinates, he, proved, that, on, a, world, line, close, to, the, timeline, space, behaves, as, if, it, were, a, euclidean, space, fermi, submitted, his, thesis, a, theorem, on, probability, and, some, of, its, applications, un, teorema, di, calcolo, delle, probabilit, ed, alcune, sue, applicazioni, to, the, scuola, normale, superiore, in, july, 1922, and, received, his, laurea, at, the, unusually, young, age, of, 20, the, thesis, was, on, x, ray, diffraction, images, theoretical, physics, was, not, yet, considered, a, discipline, in, italy, and, the, only, thesis, that, would, have, been, accepted, was, experimental, physics, for, this, reason, italian, physicists, were, slow, in, embracing, the, new, ideas, like, relativity, coming, from, germany, since, fermi, was, quite, at, home, in, the, lab, doing, experimental, work, this, did, not, pose, insurmountable, problems, for, him, while, writing, the, appendix, for, the, italian, edition, of, the, book, fundamentals, of, einstein, relativity, by, august, kopff, in, 1923, fermi, was, the, first, to, point, out, that, hidden, inside, the, einstein, equation, e, mc, 2, was, an, enormous, amount, of, nuclear, potential, energy, to, be, exploited, it, does, not, seem, possible, at, least, in, the, near, future, he, wrote, to, find, a, way, to, release, these, dreadful, amounts, of, energy, which, is, all, to, the, good, because, the, first, effect, of, an, explosion, of, such, a, dreadful, amount, of, energy, would, be, to, smash, into, smithereens, the, physicist, who, had, the, misfortune, to, find, a, way, to, do, it, in, 1924, fermi, was, initiated, into, the, masonic, lodge, adriano, lemmi, of, the, grand, orient, of, italy, in, 1923, 1924, fermi, spent, a, semester, studying, under, max, born, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, where, he, met, werner, heisenberg, and, pascual, jordan, fermi, then, studied, in, leiden, with, paul, ehrenfest, from, september, to, december, 1924, on, a, fellowship, from, the, rockefeller, foundation, obtained, through, the, intercession, of, the, mathematician, vito, volterra, here, fermi, met, hendrik, lorentz, and, albert, einstein, and, became, friends, with, samuel, goudsmit, and, jan, tinbergen, from, january, 1925, to, late, 1926, fermi, taught, mathematical, physics, and, theoretical, mechanics, at, the, university, of, florence, where, he, teamed, up, with, rasetti, to, conduct, a, series, of, experiments, on, the, effects, of, magnetic, fields, on, mercury, vapor, he, also, participated, in, seminars, at, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, giving, lectures, on, quantum, mechanics, and, solid, state, physics, while, giving, lectures, on, the, new, quantum, mechanics, based, on, the, remarkable, accuracy, of, predictions, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, fermi, would, often, say, it, has, no, business, to, fit, so, well, after, wolfgang, pauli, announced, his, exclusion, principle, in, 1925, fermi, responded, with, a, paper, on, the, quantization, of, the, perfect, monoatomic, gas, sulla, quantizzazione, del, gas, perfetto, monoatomico, in, which, he, applied, the, exclusion, principle, to, an, ideal, gas, the, paper, was, especially, notable, for, fermi, s, statistical, formulation, which, describes, the, distribution, of, particles, in, systems, of, many, identical, particles, that, obey, the, exclusion, principle, this, was, independently, developed, soon, after, by, the, british, physicist, paul, dirac, who, also, showed, how, it, was, related, to, the, bose, einstein, statistics, accordingly, it, is, now, known, as, fermi, dirac, statistics, after, dirac, particles, that, obey, the, exclusion, principle, are, today, called, fermions, while, those, that, do, not, are, called, bosons, professorships, in, italy, were, granted, by, competition, concorso, for, a, vacant, chair, the, applicants, being, rated, on, their, publications, by, a, committee, of, professors, fermi, applied, for, a, chair, of, mathematical, physics, at, the, university, of, cagliari, on, sardinia, but, was, narrowly, passed, over, in, favour, of, giovanni, giorgi, in, 1926, at, the, age, of, 24, he, applied, for, a, professorship, at, the, sapienza, university, of, rome, this, was, a, new, chair, one, of, the, first, three, in, theoretical, physics, in, italy, that, had, been, created, by, the, minister, of, education, at, the, urging, of, professor, orso, mario, corbino, who, was, the, university, s, professor, of, experimental, physics, the, director, of, the, institute, of, physics, and, a, member, of, benito, mussolini, s, cabinet, corbino, who, also, chaired, the, selection, committee, hoped, that, the, new, chair, would, raise, the, standard, and, reputation, of, physics, in, italy, the, committee, chose, fermi, ahead, of, enrico, persico, and, aldo, pontremoli, and, corbino, helped, fermi, recruit, his, team, which, was, soon, joined, by, notable, students, such, as, edoardo, amaldi, bruno, pontecorvo, ettore, majorana, and, emilio, segr, and, by, franco, rasetti, whom, fermi, had, appointed, as, his, assistant, they, soon, nicknamed, the, via, panisperna, boys, after, the, street, where, the, institute, of, physics, was, located, fermi, married, laura, capon, a, science, student, at, the, university, on, 19, july, 1928, they, had, two, children, nella, born, in, january, 1931, and, giulio, born, in, february, 1936, on, 18, march, 1929, fermi, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, royal, academy, of, italy, by, mussolini, and, on, 27, april, he, joined, the, fascist, party, he, later, opposed, fascism, when, the, 1938, racial, laws, were, promulgated, by, mussolini, in, order, to, bring, italian, fascism, ideologically, closer, to, german, nazism, these, laws, threatened, laura, who, was, jewish, and, put, many, of, fermi, s, research, assistants, out, of, work, during, their, time, in, rome, fermi, and, his, group, made, important, contributions, to, many, practical, and, theoretical, aspects, of, physics, in, 1928, he, published, his, introduction, to, atomic, physics, introduzione, alla, fisica, atomica, which, provided, italian, university, students, with, an, up, to, date, and, accessible, text, fermi, also, conducted, public, lectures, and, wrote, popular, articles, for, scientists, and, teachers, in, order, to, spread, knowledge, of, the, new, physics, as, widely, as, possible, part, of, his, teaching, method, was, to, gather, his, colleagues, and, graduate, students, together, at, the, end, of, the, day, and, go, over, a, problem, often, from, his, own, research, a, sign, of, success, was, that, foreign, students, now, began, to, come, to, italy, the, most, notable, of, these, was, the, german, physicist, hans, bethe, who, came, to, rome, as, a, rockefeller, foundation, fellow, and, collaborated, with, fermi, on, a, 1932, paper, on, the, interaction, between, two, electrons, german, ber, die, wechselwirkung, von, zwei, elektronen, at, this, time, physicists, were, puzzled, by, beta, decay, in, which, an, electron, was, emitted, from, the, atomic, nucleus, to, satisfy, the, law, of, conservation, of, energy, pauli, postulated, the, existence, of, an, invisible, particle, with, no, charge, and, little, or, no, mass, that, was, also, emitted, at, the, same, time, fermi, took, up, this, idea, which, he, developed, in, a, tentative, paper, in, 1933, and, then, a, longer, paper, the, next, year, that, incorporated, the, postulated, particle, which, fermi, called, a, neutrino, his, theory, later, referred, to, as, fermi, s, interaction, and, still, later, as, the, theory, of, the, weak, interaction, described, one, of, the, four, fundamental, forces, of, nature, the, neutrino, was, detected, after, his, death, and, his, interaction, theory, showed, why, it, was, so, difficult, to, detect, when, he, submitted, his, paper, to, the, british, journal, nature, that, journal, s, editor, turned, it, down, because, it, contained, speculations, which, were, too, remote, from, physical, reality, to, be, of, interest, to, readers, according, to, fermi, s, biographer, david, n, schwartz, it, is, at, least, strange, that, fermi, seriously, requested, publication, from, the, journal, since, at, that, time, nature, only, published, short, notes, on, articles, of, this, kind, and, was, not, suitable, for, the, publication, of, even, a, new, physical, theory, more, suitable, if, anything, would, have, been, the, proceedings, of, the, royal, society, of, london, he, agrees, with, some, scholars, hypothesis, according, to, which, the, rejection, of, the, british, magazine, convinced, his, young, colleagues, some, of, them, jews, and, leftist, to, give, up, the, boycott, of, german, scientific, magazines, after, hitler, came, to, power, in, january, 1933, thus, fermi, saw, the, theory, published, in, italian, and, german, before, it, was, published, in, english, in, the, introduction, to, the, 1968, english, translation, physicist, fred, l, wilson, noted, that, fermi, s, theory, aside, from, bolstering, pauli, s, proposal, of, the, neutrino, has, a, special, significance, in, the, history, of, modern, physics, one, must, remember, that, only, the, naturally, occurring, emitters, were, known, at, the, time, the, theory, was, proposed, later, when, positron, decay, was, discovered, the, process, was, easily, incorporated, within, fermi, s, original, framework, on, the, basis, of, his, theory, the, capture, of, an, orbital, electron, by, a, nucleus, was, predicted, and, eventually, observed, with, time, experimental, data, accumulated, significantly, although, peculiarities, have, been, observed, many, times, in, decay, fermi, s, theory, always, has, been, equal, to, the, challenge, the, consequences, of, the, fermi, theory, are, vast, for, example, spectroscopy, was, established, as, a, powerful, tool, for, the, study, of, nuclear, structure, but, perhaps, the, most, influential, aspect, of, this, work, of, fermi, is, that, his, particular, form, of, the, interaction, established, a, pattern, that, has, been, appropriate, for, the, study, of, other, types, of, interactions, it, was, the, first, successful, theory, of, the, creation, and, annihilation, of, material, particles, previously, only, photons, had, been, known, to, be, created, and, destroyed, in, january, 1934, ir, ne, joliot, curie, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, announced, that, they, had, bombarded, elements, with, alpha, particles, and, induced, radioactivity, in, them, by, march, fermi, s, assistant, gian, carlo, wick, had, provided, a, theoretical, explanation, using, fermi, s, theory, of, beta, decay, fermi, decided, to, switch, to, experimental, physics, using, the, neutron, which, james, chadwick, had, discovered, in, 1932, in, march, 1934, fermi, wanted, to, see, if, he, could, induce, radioactivity, with, rasetti, s, polonium, beryllium, neutron, source, neutrons, had, no, electric, charge, and, so, would, not, be, deflected, by, the, positively, charged, nucleus, this, meant, that, they, needed, much, less, energy, to, penetrate, the, nucleus, than, charged, particles, and, so, would, not, require, a, particle, accelerator, which, the, via, panisperna, boys, did, not, have, fermi, had, the, idea, to, resort, to, replacing, the, polonium, beryllium, neutron, source, with, a, radon, beryllium, one, which, he, created, by, filling, a, glass, bulb, with, beryllium, powder, evacuating, the, air, and, then, adding, 50, m, ci, of, radon, gas, supplied, by, giulio, cesare, trabacchi, this, created, a, much, stronger, neutron, source, the, effectiveness, of, which, declined, with, the, 3, 8, day, half, life, of, radon, he, knew, that, this, source, would, also, emit, gamma, rays, but, on, the, basis, of, his, theory, he, believed, that, this, would, not, affect, the, results, of, the, experiment, he, started, by, bombarding, platinum, an, element, with, a, high, atomic, number, that, was, readily, available, without, success, he, turned, to, aluminium, which, emitted, an, alpha, particle, and, produced, sodium, which, then, decayed, into, magnesium, by, beta, particle, emission, he, tried, lead, without, success, and, then, fluorine, in, the, form, of, calcium, fluoride, which, emitted, an, alpha, particle, and, produced, nitrogen, decaying, into, oxygen, by, beta, particle, emission, in, all, he, induced, radioactivity, in, 22, different, elements, fermi, rapidly, reported, the, discovery, of, neutron, induced, radioactivity, in, the, italian, journal, la, ricerca, scientifica, on, 25, march, 1934, the, natural, radioactivity, of, thorium, and, uranium, made, it, hard, to, determine, what, was, happening, when, these, elements, were, bombarded, with, neutrons, but, after, correctly, eliminating, the, presence, of, elements, lighter, than, uranium, but, heavier, than, lead, fermi, concluded, that, they, had, created, new, elements, which, he, called, ausenium, and, hesperium, the, chemist, ida, noddack, suggested, that, some, of, the, experiments, could, have, produced, lighter, elements, than, lead, rather, than, new, heavier, elements, her, suggestion, was, not, taken, seriously, at, the, time, because, her, team, had, not, carried, out, any, experiments, with, uranium, or, built, the, theoretical, basis, for, this, possibility, at, that, time, fission, was, thought, to, be, improbable, if, not, impossible, on, theoretical, grounds, while, physicists, expected, elements, with, higher, atomic, numbers, to, form, from, neutron, bombardment, of, lighter, elements, nobody, expected, neutrons, to, have, enough, energy, to, split, a, heavier, atom, into, two, light, element, fragments, in, the, manner, that, noddack, suggested, the, via, panisperna, boys, also, noticed, some, unexplained, effects, the, experiment, seemed, to, work, better, on, a, wooden, table, than, on, a, marble, tabletop, fermi, remembered, that, joliot, curie, and, chadwick, had, noted, that, paraffin, wax, was, effective, at, slowing, neutrons, so, he, decided, to, try, that, when, neutrons, were, passed, through, paraffin, wax, they, induced, a, hundred, times, as, much, radioactivity, in, silver, compared, with, when, it, was, bombarded, without, the, paraffin, fermi, guessed, that, this, was, due, to, the, hydrogen, atoms, in, the, paraffin, those, in, wood, similarly, explained, the, difference, between, the, wooden, and, the, marble, tabletops, this, was, confirmed, by, repeating, the, effect, with, water, he, concluded, that, collisions, with, hydrogen, atoms, slowed, the, neutrons, the, lower, the, atomic, number, of, the, nucleus, it, collides, with, the, more, energy, a, neutron, loses, per, collision, and, therefore, the, fewer, collisions, that, are, required, to, slow, a, neutron, down, by, a, given, amount, fermi, realised, that, this, induced, more, radioactivity, because, slow, neutrons, were, more, easily, captured, than, fast, ones, he, developed, a, diffusion, equation, to, describe, this, which, became, known, as, the, fermi, age, equation, in, 1938, fermi, received, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, at, the, age, of, 37, for, his, demonstrations, of, the, existence, of, new, radioactive, elements, produced, by, neutron, irradiation, and, for, his, related, discovery, of, nuclear, reactions, brought, about, by, slow, neutrons, after, fermi, received, the, prize, in, stockholm, he, did, not, return, home, to, italy, but, rather, continued, to, new, york, city, with, his, family, in, december, 1938, where, they, applied, for, permanent, residency, the, decision, to, move, to, america, and, become, us, citizens, was, due, primarily, to, the, racial, laws, in, italy, fermi, arrived, in, new, york, city, on, 2, january, 1939, he, was, immediately, offered, positions, at, five, universities, and, accepted, one, at, columbia, university, where, he, had, already, given, summer, lectures, in, 1936, he, received, the, news, that, in, december, 1938, the, german, chemists, otto, hahn, and, fritz, strassmann, had, detected, the, element, barium, after, bombarding, uranium, with, neutrons, which, lise, meitner, and, her, nephew, otto, frisch, correctly, interpreted, as, the, result, of, nuclear, fission, frisch, confirmed, this, experimentally, on, 13, january, 1939, the, news, of, meitner, and, frisch, s, interpretation, of, hahn, and, strassmann, s, discovery, crossed, the, atlantic, with, niels, bohr, who, was, to, lecture, at, princeton, university, isidor, isaac, rabi, and, willis, lamb, two, columbia, university, physicists, working, at, princeton, found, out, about, it, and, carried, it, back, to, columbia, rabi, said, he, told, enrico, fermi, but, fermi, later, gave, the, credit, to, lamb, i, remember, very, vividly, the, first, month, january, 1939, that, i, started, working, at, the, pupin, laboratories, because, things, began, happening, very, fast, in, that, period, niels, bohr, was, on, a, lecture, engagement, at, the, princeton, university, and, i, remember, one, afternoon, willis, lamb, came, back, very, excited, and, said, that, bohr, had, leaked, out, great, news, the, great, news, that, had, leaked, out, was, the, discovery, of, fission, and, at, least, the, outline, of, its, interpretation, then, somewhat, later, that, same, month, there, was, a, meeting, in, washington, where, the, possible, importance, of, the, newly, discovered, phenomenon, of, fission, was, first, discussed, in, semi, jocular, earnest, as, a, possible, source, of, nuclear, power, noddack, was, proven, right, after, all, fermi, had, dismissed, the, possibility, of, fission, on, the, basis, of, his, calculations, but, he, had, not, taken, into, account, the, binding, energy, that, would, appear, when, a, nuclide, with, an, odd, number, of, neutrons, absorbed, an, extra, neutron, for, fermi, the, news, came, as, a, profound, embarrassment, as, the, transuranic, elements, that, he, had, partly, been, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, discovering, had, not, been, transuranic, elements, at, all, but, fission, products, he, added, a, footnote, to, this, effect, to, his, nobel, prize, acceptance, speech, the, scientists, at, columbia, decided, that, they, should, try, to, detect, the, energy, released, in, the, nuclear, fission, of, uranium, when, bombarded, by, neutrons, on, 25, january, 1939, in, the, basement, of, pupin, hall, at, columbia, an, experimental, team, including, fermi, conducted, the, first, nuclear, fission, experiment, in, the, united, states, the, other, members, of, the, team, were, herbert, l, anderson, eugene, t, booth, john, r, dunning, g, norris, glasoe, and, francis, g, slack, the, next, day, the, fifth, washington, conference, on, theoretical, physics, began, in, washington, d, c, under, the, joint, auspices, of, george, washington, university, and, the, carnegie, institution, of, washington, there, the, news, on, nuclear, fission, was, spread, even, further, fostering, many, more, experimental, demonstrations, french, scientists, hans, von, halban, lew, kowarski, and, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, had, demonstrated, that, uranium, bombarded, by, neutrons, emitted, more, neutrons, than, it, absorbed, suggesting, the, possibility, of, a, chain, reaction, fermi, and, anderson, did, so, too, a, few, weeks, later, le, szil, rd, obtained, 200, kilograms, 440, lb, of, uranium, oxide, from, canadian, radium, producer, eldorado, gold, mines, limited, allowing, fermi, and, anderson, to, conduct, experiments, with, fission, on, a, much, larger, scale, fermi, and, szil, rd, collaborated, on, the, design, of, a, device, to, achieve, a, self, sustaining, nuclear, reaction, a, nuclear, reactor, owing, to, the, rate, of, absorption, of, neutrons, by, the, hydrogen, in, water, it, was, unlikely, that, a, self, sustaining, reaction, could, be, achieved, with, natural, uranium, and, water, as, a, neutron, moderator, fermi, suggested, based, on, his, work, with, neutrons, that, the, reaction, could, be, achieved, with, uranium, oxide, blocks, and, graphite, as, a, moderator, instead, of, water, this, would, reduce, the, neutron, capture, rate, and, in, theory, make, a, self, sustaining, chain, reaction, possible, szil, rd, came, up, with, a, workable, design, a, pile, of, uranium, oxide, blocks, interspersed, with, graphite, bricks, szil, rd, anderson, and, fermi, published, a, paper, on, neutron, production, in, uranium, but, their, work, habits, and, personalities, were, different, and, fermi, had, trouble, working, with, szil, rd, fermi, was, among, the, first, to, warn, military, leaders, about, the, potential, impact, of, nuclear, energy, giving, a, lecture, on, the, subject, at, the, navy, department, on, 18, march, 1939, the, response, fell, short, of, what, he, had, hoped, for, although, the, navy, agreed, to, provide, 1, 500, towards, further, research, at, columbia, later, that, year, szil, rd, eugene, wigner, and, edward, teller, sent, the, letter, signed, by, einstein, to, us, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, warning, that, nazi, germany, was, likely, to, build, an, atomic, bomb, in, response, roosevelt, formed, the, advisory, committee, on, uranium, to, investigate, the, matter, the, advisory, committee, on, uranium, provided, money, for, fermi, to, buy, graphite, and, he, built, a, pile, of, graphite, bricks, on, the, seventh, floor, of, the, pupin, hall, laboratory, by, august, 1941, he, had, six, tons, of, uranium, oxide, and, thirty, tons, of, graphite, which, he, used, to, build, a, still, larger, pile, in, schermerhorn, hall, at, columbia, the, s, 1, section, of, the, office, of, scientific, research, and, development, as, the, advisory, committee, on, uranium, was, now, known, met, on, 18, december, 1941, with, the, us, now, engaged, in, world, war, ii, making, its, work, urgent, most, of, the, effort, sponsored, by, the, committee, had, been, directed, at, producing, enriched, uranium, but, committee, member, arthur, compton, determined, that, a, feasible, alternative, was, plutonium, which, could, be, mass, produced, in, nuclear, reactors, by, the, end, of, 1944, he, decided, to, concentrate, the, plutonium, work, at, the, university, of, chicago, fermi, reluctantly, moved, and, his, team, became, part, of, the, new, metallurgical, laboratory, there, the, possible, results, of, a, self, sustaining, nuclear, reaction, were, unknown, so, it, seemed, inadvisable, to, build, the, first, nuclear, reactor, on, the, university, of, chicago, campus, in, the, middle, of, the, city, compton, found, a, location, in, the, argonne, woods, forest, preserve, about, 20, miles, 32, km, from, chicago, stone, webster, was, contracted, to, develop, the, site, but, the, work, was, halted, by, an, industrial, dispute, fermi, then, persuaded, compton, that, he, could, build, the, reactor, in, the, squash, court, under, the, stands, of, the, university, of, chicago, s, stagg, field, construction, of, the, pile, began, on, 6, november, 1942, and, chicago, pile, 1, went, critical, on, 2, december, the, shape, of, the, pile, was, intended, to, be, roughly, spherical, but, as, work, proceeded, fermi, calculated, that, criticality, could, be, achieved, without, finishing, the, entire, pile, as, planned, this, experiment, was, a, landmark, in, the, quest, for, energy, and, it, was, typical, of, fermi, s, approach, every, step, was, carefully, planned, and, every, calculation, was, meticulously, done, when, the, first, self, sustained, nuclear, chain, reaction, was, achieved, compton, made, a, coded, phone, call, to, james, b, conant, the, chairman, of, the, national, defense, research, committee, i, picked, up, the, phone, and, called, conant, he, was, reached, at, the, president, s, office, at, harvard, university, jim, i, said, you, ll, be, interested, to, know, that, the, italian, navigator, has, just, landed, in, the, new, world, then, half, apologetically, because, i, had, led, the, s, l, committee, to, believe, that, it, would, be, another, week, or, more, before, the, pile, could, be, completed, i, added, the, earth, was, not, as, large, as, he, had, estimated, and, he, arrived, at, the, new, world, sooner, than, he, had, expected, is, that, so, was, conant, s, excited, response, were, the, natives, friendly, everyone, landed, safe, and, happy, to, continue, the, research, where, it, would, not, pose, a, public, health, hazard, the, reactor, was, disassembled, and, moved, to, the, argonne, woods, site, there, fermi, directed, experiments, on, nuclear, reactions, reveling, in, the, opportunities, provided, by, the, reactor, s, abundant, production, of, free, neutrons, the, laboratory, soon, branched, out, from, physics, and, engineering, into, using, the, reactor, for, biological, and, medical, research, initially, argonne, was, run, by, fermi, as, part, of, the, university, of, chicago, but, it, became, a, separate, entity, with, fermi, as, its, director, in, may, 1944, when, the, air, cooled, x, 10, graphite, reactor, at, oak, ridge, went, critical, on, 4, november, 1943, fermi, was, on, hand, just, in, case, something, went, wrong, the, technicians, woke, him, early, so, that, he, could, see, it, happen, getting, x, 10, operational, was, another, milestone, in, the, plutonium, project, it, provided, data, on, reactor, design, training, for, dupont, staff, in, reactor, operation, and, produced, the, first, small, quantities, of, reactor, bred, plutonium, fermi, became, an, american, citizen, in, july, 1944, the, earliest, date, the, law, allowed, in, september, 1944, fermi, inserted, the, first, uranium, fuel, slug, into, the, b, reactor, at, the, hanford, site, the, production, reactor, designed, to, breed, plutonium, in, large, quantities, like, x, 10, it, had, been, designed, by, fermi, s, team, at, the, metallurgical, laboratory, and, built, by, dupont, but, it, was, much, larger, and, was, water, cooled, over, the, next, few, days, 838, tubes, were, loaded, and, the, reactor, went, critical, shortly, after, midnight, on, 27, september, the, operators, began, to, withdraw, the, control, rods, to, initiate, production, at, first, all, appeared, to, be, well, but, around, 03, 00, the, power, level, started, to, drop, and, by, 06, 30, the, reactor, had, shut, down, completely, the, army, and, dupont, turned, to, fermi, s, team, for, answers, the, cooling, water, was, investigated, to, see, if, there, was, a, leak, or, contamination, the, next, day, the, reactor, suddenly, started, up, again, only, to, shut, down, once, more, a, few, hours, later, the, problem, was, traced, to, neutron, poisoning, from, xenon, 135, or, xe, 135, a, fission, product, with, a, half, life, of, 9, 1, to, 9, 4, hours, fermi, and, john, wheeler, both, deduced, that, xe, 135, was, responsible, for, absorbing, neutrons, in, the, reactor, thereby, sabotaging, the, fission, process, fermi, was, recommended, by, colleague, emilio, segr, to, ask, chien, shiung, wu, as, she, prepared, a, printed, draft, on, this, topic, to, be, published, by, the, physical, review, upon, reading, the, draft, fermi, and, the, scientists, confirmed, their, suspicions, xe, 135, indeed, absorbed, neutrons, in, fact, it, had, a, huge, neutron, cross, section, dupont, had, deviated, from, the, metallurgical, laboratory, s, original, design, in, which, the, reactor, had, 1, 500, tubes, arranged, in, a, circle, and, had, added, 504, tubes, to, fill, in, the, corners, the, scientists, had, originally, considered, this, over, engineering, a, waste, of, time, and, money, but, fermi, realized, that, if, all, 2, 004, tubes, were, loaded, the, reactor, could, reach, the, required, power, level, and, efficiently, produce, plutonium, in, april, 1943, fermi, raised, with, robert, oppenheimer, the, possibility, of, using, the, radioactive, byproducts, from, enrichment, to, contaminate, the, german, food, supply, the, background, was, fear, that, the, german, atomic, bomb, project, was, already, at, an, advanced, stage, and, fermi, was, also, skeptical, at, the, time, that, an, atomic, bomb, could, be, developed, quickly, enough, oppenheimer, discussed, the, promising, proposal, with, edward, teller, who, suggested, the, use, of, strontium, 90, james, b, conant, and, leslie, groves, were, also, briefed, but, oppenheimer, wanted, to, proceed, with, the, plan, only, if, enough, food, could, be, contaminated, with, the, weapon, to, kill, half, a, million, people, in, mid, 1944, oppenheimer, persuaded, fermi, to, join, his, project, y, at, los, alamos, new, mexico, arriving, in, september, fermi, was, appointed, an, associate, director, of, the, laboratory, with, broad, responsibility, for, nuclear, and, theoretical, physics, and, was, placed, in, charge, of, f, division, which, was, named, after, him, f, division, had, four, branches, f, 1, super, and, general, theory, under, teller, which, investigated, the, super, thermonuclear, bomb, f, 2, water, boiler, under, l, d, p, king, which, looked, after, the, water, boiler, aqueous, homogeneous, research, reactor, f, 3, super, experimentation, under, egon, bretscher, and, f, 4, fission, studies, under, anderson, fermi, observed, the, trinity, test, on, 16, july, 1945, and, conducted, an, experiment, to, estimate, the, bomb, s, yield, by, dropping, strips, of, paper, into, the, blast, wave, he, paced, off, the, distance, they, were, blown, by, the, explosion, and, calculated, the, yield, as, ten, kilotons, of, tnt, the, actual, yield, was, about, 18, 6, kilotons, along, with, oppenheimer, compton, and, ernest, lawrence, fermi, was, part, of, the, scientific, panel, that, advised, the, interim, committee, on, target, selection, the, panel, agreed, with, the, committee, that, atomic, bombs, would, be, used, without, warning, against, an, industrial, target, like, others, at, the, los, alamos, laboratory, fermi, found, out, about, the, atomic, bombings, of, hiroshima, and, nagasaki, from, the, public, address, system, in, the, technical, area, fermi, did, not, believe, that, atomic, bombs, would, deter, nations, from, starting, wars, nor, did, he, think, that, the, time, was, ripe, for, world, government, he, therefore, did, not, join, the, association, of, los, alamos, scientists, fermi, became, the, charles, h, swift, distinguished, professor, of, physics, at, the, university, of, chicago, on, 1, july, 1945, although, he, did, not, depart, the, los, alamos, laboratory, with, his, family, until, 31, december, 1945, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, us, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1945, the, metallurgical, laboratory, became, the, argonne, national, laboratory, on, 1, july, 1946, the, first, of, the, national, laboratories, established, by, the, manhattan, project, the, short, distance, between, chicago, and, argonne, allowed, fermi, to, work, at, both, places, at, argonne, he, continued, experimental, physics, investigating, neutron, scattering, with, leona, marshall, he, also, discussed, theoretical, physics, with, maria, mayer, helping, her, develop, insights, into, spin, orbit, coupling, that, would, lead, to, her, receiving, the, nobel, prize, the, manhattan, project, was, replaced, by, the, atomic, energy, commission, aec, on, 1, january, 1947, fermi, served, on, the, aec, general, advisory, committee, an, influential, scientific, committee, chaired, by, robert, oppenheimer, he, also, liked, to, spend, a, few, weeks, each, year, at, the, los, alamos, national, laboratory, where, he, collaborated, with, nicholas, metropolis, and, with, john, von, neumann, on, rayleigh, taylor, instability, the, science, of, what, occurs, at, the, border, between, two, fluids, of, different, densities, after, the, detonation, of, the, first, soviet, fission, bomb, in, august, 1949, fermi, along, with, isidor, rabi, wrote, a, strongly, worded, report, for, the, committee, opposing, the, development, of, a, hydrogen, bomb, on, moral, and, technical, grounds, nonetheless, fermi, continued, to, participate, in, work, on, the, hydrogen, bomb, at, los, alamos, as, a, consultant, along, with, stanislaw, ulam, he, calculated, that, not, only, would, the, amount, of, tritium, needed, for, teller, s, model, of, a, thermonuclear, weapon, be, prohibitive, but, a, fusion, reaction, could, still, not, be, assured, to, propagate, even, with, this, large, quantity, of, tritium, fermi, was, among, the, scientists, who, testified, on, oppenheimer, s, behalf, at, the, oppenheimer, security, hearing, in, 1954, that, resulted, in, the, denial, of, oppenheimer, s, security, clearance, in, his, later, years, fermi, continued, teaching, at, the, university, of, chicago, where, he, was, a, founder, of, what, later, became, the, enrico, fermi, institute, his, phd, students, in, the, postwar, period, included, owen, chamberlain, geoffrey, chew, jerome, friedman, marvin, goldberger, tsung, dao, lee, arthur, rosenfeld, and, sam, treiman, jack, steinberger, was, a, graduate, student, and, mildred, dresselhaus, was, highly, influenced, by, fermi, during, the, year, she, overlapped, with, him, as, a, phd, student, fermi, conducted, important, research, in, particle, physics, especially, related, to, pions, and, muons, he, made, the, first, predictions, of, pion, nucleon, resonance, relying, on, statistical, methods, since, he, reasoned, that, exact, answers, were, not, required, when, the, theory, was, wrong, anyway, in, a, paper, coauthored, with, chen, ning, yang, he, speculated, that, pions, might, actually, be, composite, particles, the, idea, was, elaborated, by, shoichi, sakata, it, has, since, been, supplanted, by, the, quark, model, in, which, the, pion, is, made, up, of, quarks, which, completed, fermi, s, model, and, vindicated, his, approach, fermi, wrote, a, paper, on, the, origin, of, cosmic, radiation, in, which, he, proposed, that, cosmic, rays, arose, through, material, being, accelerated, by, magnetic, fields, in, interstellar, space, which, led, to, a, difference, of, opinion, with, teller, fermi, examined, the, issues, surrounding, magnetic, fields, in, the, arms, of, a, spiral, galaxy, he, mused, about, what, is, now, referred, to, as, the, fermi, paradox, the, contradiction, between, the, presumed, probability, of, the, existence, of, extraterrestrial, life, and, the, fact, that, contact, has, not, been, made, toward, the, end, of, his, life, fermi, questioned, his, faith, in, society, at, large, to, make, wise, choices, about, nuclear, technology, he, said, some, of, you, may, ask, what, is, the, good, of, working, so, hard, merely, to, collect, a, few, facts, which, will, bring, no, pleasure, except, to, a, few, long, haired, professors, who, love, to, collect, such, things, and, will, be, of, no, use, to, anybody, because, only, few, specialists, at, best, will, be, able, to, understand, them, in, answer, to, such, question, i, may, venture, a, fairly, safe, prediction, the, history, of, science, and, technology, has, consistently, taught, us, that, scientific, advances, in, basic, understanding, have, sooner, or, later, led, to, technical, and, industrial, applications, that, have, revolutionized, our, way, of, life, it, seems, to, me, improbable, that, this, effort, to, get, at, the, structure, of, matter, should, be, an, exception, to, this, rule, what, is, less, certain, and, what, we, all, fervently, hope, is, that, man, will, soon, grow, sufficiently, adult, to, make, good, use, of, the, powers, that, he, acquires, over, nature, fermi, underwent, what, was, called, an, exploratory, operation, in, billings, memorial, hospital, in, october, 1954, after, which, he, returned, home, fifty, days, later, he, died, of, inoperable, stomach, cancer, in, his, home, in, chicago, he, was, 53, fermi, suspected, working, near, the, nuclear, pile, involved, great, risk, but, he, pressed, on, because, he, felt, the, benefits, outweighed, the, risks, to, his, personal, safety, two, of, his, graduate, student, assistants, working, near, the, pile, also, died, of, cancer, a, memorial, service, was, held, at, the, university, of, chicago, chapel, where, colleagues, samuel, k, allison, emilio, segr, and, herbert, l, anderson, spoke, to, mourn, the, loss, of, one, of, the, world, s, most, brilliant, and, productive, physicists, his, body, was, interred, at, oak, woods, cemetery, where, a, private, graveside, service, for, the, immediate, family, took, place, presided, by, a, lutheran, chaplain, fermi, received, numerous, awards, in, recognition, of, his, achievements, including, the, matteucci, medal, in, 1926, the, nobel, prize, for, physics, in, 1938, the, hughes, medal, in, 1942, the, franklin, medal, in, 1947, and, the, rumford, prize, in, 1953, he, was, awarded, the, medal, for, merit, in, 1946, for, his, contribution, to, the, manhattan, project, fermi, was, elected, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1939, and, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1950, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, florence, known, as, the, temple, of, italian, glories, for, its, many, graves, of, artists, scientists, and, prominent, figures, in, italian, history, has, a, plaque, commemorating, fermi, in, 1999, time, named, fermi, on, its, list, of, the, top, 100, persons, of, the, twentieth, century, fermi, was, widely, regarded, as, an, unusual, case, of, a, 20th, century, physicist, who, excelled, both, theoretically, and, experimentally, chemist, and, novelist, c, p, snow, wrote, if, fermi, had, been, born, a, few, years, earlier, one, could, well, imagine, him, discovering, rutherford, s, atomic, nucleus, and, then, developing, bohr, s, theory, of, the, hydrogen, atom, if, this, sounds, like, hyperbole, anything, about, fermi, is, likely, to, sound, like, hyperbole, fermi, was, known, as, an, inspiring, teacher, and, was, noted, for, his, attention, to, detail, simplicity, and, careful, preparation, of, his, lectures, later, his, lecture, notes, were, transcribed, into, books, his, papers, and, notebooks, are, today, in, the, university, of, chicago, victor, weisskopf, noted, how, fermi, always, managed, to, find, the, simplest, and, most, direct, approach, with, the, minimum, of, complication, and, sophistication, he, disliked, complicated, theories, and, while, he, had, great, mathematical, ability, he, would, never, use, it, when, the, job, could, be, done, much, more, simply, he, was, famous, for, getting, quick, and, accurate, answers, to, problems, that, would, stump, other, people, later, on, his, method, of, getting, approximate, and, quick, answers, through, back, of, the, envelope, calculations, became, informally, known, as, the, fermi, method, and, is, widely, taught, fermi, was, fond, of, pointing, out, that, when, alessandro, volta, was, working, in, his, laboratory, volta, had, no, idea, where, the, study, of, electricity, would, lead, fermi, is, generally, remembered, for, his, work, on, nuclear, power, and, nuclear, weapons, especially, the, creation, of, the, first, nuclear, reactor, and, the, development, of, the, first, atomic, and, hydrogen, bombs, his, scientific, work, has, stood, the, test, of, time, this, includes, his, theory, of, beta, decay, his, work, with, non, linear, systems, his, discovery, of, the, effects, of, slow, neutrons, his, study, of, pion, nucleon, collisions, and, his, fermi, dirac, statistics, his, speculation, that, a, pion, was, not, a, fundamental, particle, pointed, the, way, towards, the, study, of, quarks, and, leptons, as, a, person, fermi, seemed, simplicity, itself, he, was, extraordinarily, vigorous, and, loved, games, and, sport, on, such, occasions, his, ambitious, nature, became, apparent, he, played, tennis, with, considerable, ferocity, and, when, climbing, mountains, acted, rather, as, a, guide, one, might, have, called, him, a, benevolent, dictator, i, remember, once, at, the, top, of, a, mountain, fermi, got, up, and, said, well, it, is, two, minutes, to, two, let, s, all, leave, at, two, o, clock, and, of, course, everybody, got, up, faithfully, and, obediently, this, leadership, and, self, assurance, gave, fermi, the, name, of, the, pope, whose, pronouncements, were, infallible, in, physics, he, once, said, i, can, calculate, anything, in, physics, within, a, factor, 2, on, a, few, sheets, to, get, the, numerical, factor, in, front, of, the, formula, right, may, well, take, a, physicist, a, year, to, calculate, but, i, am, not, interested, in, that, his, leadership, could, go, so, far, that, it, was, a, danger, to, the, independence, of, the, person, working, with, him, i, recollect, once, at, a, party, at, his, house, when, my, wife, cut, the, bread, fermi, came, along, and, said, he, had, a, different, philosophy, on, bread, cutting, and, took, the, knife, out, of, my, wife, s, hand, and, proceeded, with, the, job, because, he, was, convinced, that, his, own, method, was, superior, but, all, this, did, not, offend, at, all, but, rather, charmed, everybody, into, liking, fermi, he, had, very, few, interests, outside, physics, and, when, he, once, heard, me, play, on, teller, s, piano, he, confessed, that, his, interest, in, music, was, restricted, to, simple, tunes, many, things, bear, fermi, s, name, these, include, the, fermilab, particle, accelerator, and, physics, lab, in, batavia, illinois, which, was, renamed, in, his, honor, in, 1974, and, the, fermi, gamma, ray, space, telescope, which, was, named, after, him, in, 2008, in, recognition, of, his, work, on, cosmic, rays, three, nuclear, reactor, installations, have, been, named, after, him, the, fermi, 1, and, fermi, 2, nuclear, power, plants, in, newport, michigan, the, enrico, fermi, nuclear, power, plant, at, trino, vercellese, in, italy, and, the, ra, 1, enrico, fermi, research, reactor, in, argentina, a, synthetic, element, isolated, from, the, debris, of, the, 1952, ivy, mike, nuclear, test, was, named, fermium, in, honor, of, fermi, s, contributions, to, the, scientific, community, this, makes, him, one, of, 16, scientists, who, have, elements, named, after, them, since, 1956, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, has, named, its, highest, honor, the, fermi, award, after, him, recipients, of, the, award, have, included, otto, hahn, robert, oppenheimer, edward, teller, and, hans, bethe, for, a, full, list, of, his, papers, see, pages, 75, 78, in, ref
