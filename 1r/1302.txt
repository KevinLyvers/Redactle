neglected, the, advice, of, prince, eugene, of, savoy, who, believed, that, a, strong, military, and, a, rich, treasury, were, more, important, than, mere, signatures, eventually, charles, vi, left, behind, a, weakened, and, impoverished, state, particularly, due, to, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, and, the, russo, turkish, war, 1735, 1739, moreover, upon, his, death, saxony, prussia, bavaria, and, france, all, repudiated, the, sanction, they, had, recognised, during, his, lifetime, frederick, ii, of, prussia, who, became, maria, theresa, s, greatest, rival, for, most, of, her, reign, promptly, invaded, and, took, the, affluent, habsburg, province, of, silesia, in, the, eight, year, conflict, known, as, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, in, defiance, of, the, grave, situation, she, managed, to, secure, the, vital, support, of, the, hungarians, for, the, war, effort, during, the, course, of, the, war, maria, theresa, successfully, defended, her, rule, over, most, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, apart, from, the, loss, of, silesia, and, a, few, minor, territories, in, italy, maria, theresa, later, unsuccessfully, tried, to, recover, silesia, during, the, seven, years, war, although, she, was, expected, to, cede, power, to, her, husband, emperor, francis, i, and, her, eldest, son, emperor, joseph, ii, who, were, officially, her, co, rulers, in, austria, and, bohemia, maria, theresa, ruled, as, an, autocratic, sovereign, with, the, counsel, of, her, advisers, she, promulgated, institutional, financial, medical, and, educational, reforms, with, the, assistance, of, wenzel, anton, of, kaunitz, rietberg, friedrich, wilhelm, von, haugwitz, and, gerard, van, swieten, she, also, promoted, commerce, and, the, development, of, agriculture, and, reorganised, austria, s, ramshackle, military, all, of, which, strengthened, austria, s, international, standing, a, pious, catholic, she, despised, jews, and, protestants, and, on, certain, occasions, she, ordered, their, expulsion, to, remote, parts, of, the, realm, she, also, advocated, for, the, state, church, the, second, and, eldest, surviving, child, of, holy, roman, emperor,

neuburg, were, her, godmothers, most, descriptions, of, her, baptism, stress, that, the, infant, was, carried, ahead, of, her, cousins, maria, josepha, and, maria, amalia, the, daughters, of, charles, vi, s, elder, brother, and, predecessor, joseph, i, before, the, eyes, of, their, mother, wilhelmine, amalia, it, was, clear, that, maria, theresa, would, outrank, them, even, though, their, grandfather, holy, roman, emperor, leopold, i, had, his, sons, sign, the, mutual, pact, of, succession, which, gave, precedence, to, the, daughters, of, the, elder, brother, her, father, was, the, only, surviving, male, member, of, the, house, of, habsburg, and, hoped, for, a, son, who, would, prevent, the, extinction, of, his, dynasty, and, succeed, him, thus, the, birth, of, maria, theresa, was, a, great, disappointment, to, him, and, the, people, of, vienna, charles, never, managed, to, overcome, this, feeling, maria, theresa, replaced, maria, josepha, as, heir, presumptive, to, the, habsburg, realms, the, moment, she, was, born, charles, vi, had, issued, the, pragmatic, sanction, of, 1713, which, had, placed, his, nieces, behind, his, own, daughters, in, the, line, of, succession, charles, sought, the, other, european, powers, approval, for, disinheriting, his, nieces, they, exacted, harsh, terms, in, the, treaty, of, vienna, great, britain, demanded, that, austria, abolish, the, ostend, company, in, return, for, its, recognition, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, in, total, great, britain, france, saxony, united, provinces, spain, prussia, russia, denmark, sardinia, bavaria, and, the, diet, of, the, holy, roman, empire, recognised, the, sanction, france, spain, saxony, bavaria, and, prussia, later, reneged, little, more, than, a, year, after, her, birth, maria, theresa, was, joined, by, a, sister, maria, anna, and, another, one, named, maria, amalia, was, born, in, 1724, the, portraits, of, the, imperial, family, show, that, maria, theresa, resembled, elisabeth, christine, and, maria, anna, the, prussian, ambassador, noted, that, she, had, large, blue, eyes, fair, hair, with, a, slight, tinge, of, red, a, wide, mouth, and, a, notably, strong, body, unlike, many, other, members, of, the, house, of, habsburg, neither, maria, theresa, s, parents, nor, her, grandparents, were, closely, related, to, each, other, maria, theresa, was, a, serious, and, reserved, child, who, enjoyed, singing, and, archery, she, was, barred, from, horse, riding, by, her, father, but, she, would, later, learn, the, basics, for, the, sake, of, her, hungarian, coronation, ceremony, the, imperial, family, staged, opera, productions, often, conducted, by, charles, vi, in, which, she, relished, participating, her, education, was, overseen, by, jesuits, contemporaries, thought, her, latin, to, be, quite, good, but, in, all, else, the, jesuits, did, not, educate, her, well, her, spelling, and, punctuation, were, unconventional, and, she, lacked, the, formal, manner, and, speech, which, had, characterised, her, habsburg, predecessors, maria, theresa, developed, a, close, relationship, with, countess, marie, karoline, von, fuchs, mollard, who, taught, her, etiquette, she, was, educated, in, drawing, painting, music, and, dancing, the, disciplines, which, would, have, prepared, her, for, the, role, of, queen, consort, her, father, allowed, her, to, attend, meetings, of, the, council, from, the, age, of, 14, but, never, discussed, the, affairs, of, state, with, her, even, though, he, had, spent, the, last, decades, of, his, life, securing, maria, theresa, s, inheritance, charles, never, prepared, his, daughter, for, her, future, role, as, sovereign, the, question, of, maria, theresa, s, marriage, was, raised, early, in, her, childhood, leopold, clement, of, lorraine, was, first, considered, to, be, the, appropriate, suitor, and, he, was, supposed, to, visit, vienna, and, meet, the, archduchess, in, 1723, these, plans, were, forestalled, by, his, death, from, smallpox, that, year, leopold, clement, s, younger, brother, francis, stephen, was, invited, to, vienna, even, though, francis, stephen, was, his, favourite, candidate, for, maria, theresa, s, hand, the, emperor, considered, other, possibilities, religious, differences, prevented, him, from, arranging, his, daughter, s, marriage, to, the, protestant, prince, frederick, of, prussia, in, 1725, he, betrothed, her, to, charles, of, spain, and, her, sister, maria, anna, to, philip, of, spain, however, other, european, powers, compelled, him, to, renounce, the, pact, he, had, made, with, the, queen, of, spain, elisabeth, farnese, and, the, betrothal, to, charles, was, broken, off, maria, theresa, who, had, become, close, to, francis, stephen, was, relieved, francis, stephen, remained, at, the, imperial, court, until, 1729, when, he, ascended, the, throne, of, lorraine, but, was, not, formally, promised, maria, theresa, s, hand, until, 31, january, 1736, during, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, louis, xv, of, france, demanded, that, maria, theresa, s, fianc, surrender, his, ancestral, duchy, of, lorraine, to, accommodate, his, father, in, law, stanis, aw, i, who, had, been, deposed, as, king, of, poland, francis, stephen, was, to, receive, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, upon, the, death, of, childless, grand, duke, gian, gastone, de, medici, the, couple, were, married, on, 12, february, 1736, at, the, augustinian, church, in, vienna, the, duchess, of, lorraine, s, love, for, her, husband, was, strong, and, possessive, the, letters, she, sent, to, him, shortly, before, their, marriage, expressed, her, eagerness, to, see, him, his, letters, on, the, other, hand, were, stereotyped, and, formal, she, was, very, jealous, of, her, husband, and, his, infidelity, was, the, greatest, problem, of, their, marriage, with, maria, wilhelmina, princess, of, auersperg, as, his, best, known, mistress, upon, gian, gastone, s, death, on, 9, july, 1737, francis, stephen, ceded, lorraine, and, became, grand, duke, of, tuscany, in, 1738, charles, vi, sent, the, young, couple, to, make, their, formal, entry, into, tuscany, the, triumphal, arch, of, the, lorraine, was, erected, at, the, porta, galla, in, celebration, where, it, remains, today, their, stay, in, florence, was, brief, charles, vi, soon, recalled, them, as, he, feared, he, might, die, while, his, heiress, was, miles, away, in, tuscany, in, the, summer, of, 1738, austria, suffered, defeats, during, the, ongoing, russo, turkish, war, the, turks, reversed, austrian, gains, in, serbia, wallachia, and, bosnia, the, viennese, rioted, at, the, cost, of, the, war, francis, stephen, was, popularly, despised, as, he, was, thought, to, be, a, cowardly, french, spy, the, war, was, concluded, the, next, year, with, the, treaty, of, belgrade, charles, vi, died, on, 20, october, 1740, probably, of, mushroom, poisoning, he, had, ignored, the, advice, of, prince, eugene, of, savoy, who, had, urged, him, to, concentrate, on, filling, the, treasury, and, equipping, the, army, rather, than, on, acquiring, signatures, of, fellow, monarchs, the, emperor, who, spent, his, entire, reign, securing, the, pragmatic, sanction, left, austria, in, an, impoverished, state, bankrupted, by, the, recent, turkish, war, and, the, war, of, the, polish, succession, the, treasury, contained, only, 100, 000, florins, which, were, claimed, by, his, widow, the, army, had, also, been, weakened, due, to, these, wars, instead, of, the, full, number, of, 160, 000, the, army, had, been, reduced, to, about, 108, 000, and, they, were, scattered, in, small, areas, from, the, austrian, netherlands, to, transylvania, and, from, silesia, to, tuscany, they, were, also, poorly, trained, and, discipline, was, lacking, later, maria, theresa, even, made, a, remark, as, for, the, state, in, which, i, found, the, army, i, cannot, begin, to, describe, it, maria, theresa, found, herself, in, a, difficult, situation, she, did, not, know, enough, about, matters, of, state, and, she, was, unaware, of, the, weakness, of, her, father, s, ministers, she, decided, to, rely, on, her, father, s, advice, to, retain, his, counselors, and, to, defer, to, her, husband, whom, she, considered, to, be, more, experienced, on, other, matters, both, decisions, later, gave, cause, for, regret, ten, years, later, maria, theresa, recalled, in, her, political, testament, the, circumstances, under, which, she, had, ascended, i, found, myself, without, money, without, credit, without, army, without, experience, and, knowledge, of, my, own, and, finally, also, without, any, counsel, because, each, one, of, them, at, first, wanted, to, wait, and, see, how, things, would, develop, she, dismissed, the, possibility, that, other, countries, might, try, to, seize, her, territories, and, immediately, started, ensuring, the, imperial, dignity, for, herself, since, a, woman, could, not, be, elected, holy, roman, empress, maria, theresa, wanted, to, secure, the, imperial, office, for, her, husband, but, francis, stephen, did, not, possess, enough, land, or, rank, within, the, holy, roman, empire, in, order, to, make, him, eligible, for, the, imperial, throne, and, to, enable, him, to, vote, in, the, imperial, elections, as, king, of, bohemia, which, she, could, not, do, because, of, her, sex, maria, theresa, made, francis, stephen, co, ruler, of, the, austrian, and, bohemian, lands, on, 21, november, 1740, it, took, more, than, a, year, for, the, diet, of, hungary, to, accept, francis, stephen, as, co, ruler, since, they, asserted, that, the, sovereignty, of, hungary, could, not, be, shared, despite, her, love, for, him, and, his, position, as, co, ruler, maria, theresa, never, allowed, her, husband, to, decide, matters, of, state, and, often, dismissed, him, from, council, meetings, when, they, disagreed, the, first, display, of, the, new, queen, s, authority, was, the, formal, act, of, homage, of, the, lower, austrian, estates, to, her, on, 22, november, 1740, it, was, an, elaborate, public, event, which, served, as, a, formal, recognition, and, legitimation, of, her, accession, the, oath, of, fealty, to, maria, theresa, was, taken, on, the, same, day, in, the, ritterstube, of, the, hofburg, immediately, after, her, accession, a, number, of, european, sovereigns, who, had, recognised, maria, theresa, as, heir, broke, their, promises, queen, elisabeth, of, spain, and, elector, charles, albert, of, bavaria, married, to, maria, theresa, s, deprived, cousin, maria, amalia, and, supported, by, empress, wilhelmine, amalia, coveted, portions, of, her, inheritance, maria, theresa, did, secure, recognition, from, king, charles, emmanuel, iii, of, sardinia, who, had, not, accepted, the, pragmatic, sanction, during, her, father, s, lifetime, in, november, 1740, in, december, frederick, ii, of, prussia, invaded, the, duchy, of, silesia, and, requested, that, maria, theresa, cede, it, threatening, to, join, her, enemies, if, she, refused, maria, theresa, decided, to, fight, for, the, mineral, rich, province, frederick, even, offered, a, compromise, he, would, defend, maria, theresa, s, rights, if, she, agreed, to, cede, to, him, at, least, a, part, of, silesia, francis, stephen, was, inclined, to, consider, such, an, arrangement, but, the, queen, and, her, advisers, were, not, fearing, that, any, violation, of, the, pragmatic, sanction, would, invalidate, the, entire, document, maria, theresa, s, firmness, soon, assured, francis, stephen, that, they, should, fight, for, silesia, and, she, was, confident, that, she, would, retain, the, jewel, of, the, house, of, austria, the, resulting, war, with, prussia, is, known, as, the, first, silesian, war, the, invasion, of, silesia, by, frederick, was, the, start, of, a, lifelong, enmity, she, referred, to, him, as, that, evil, man, as, austria, was, short, of, experienced, military, commanders, maria, theresa, released, marshall, neipperg, who, had, been, imprisoned, by, her, father, for, his, poor, performance, in, the, turkish, war, neipperg, took, command, of, the, austrian, troops, in, march, the, austrians, suffered, a, crushing, defeat, at, the, battle, of, mollwitz, in, april, 1741, france, drew, up, a, plan, to, partition, austria, between, prussia, bavaria, saxony, and, spain, bohemia, and, upper, austria, would, be, ceded, to, bavaria, whose, elector, would, become, emperor, whereas, moravia, and, upper, silesia, would, be, granted, to, the, electorate, of, saxony, lower, silesia, and, glatz, to, prussia, and, the, entire, austrian, lombardy, to, spain, marshall, belle, isle, joined, frederick, at, olm, tz, vienna, was, in, a, panic, as, none, of, maria, theresa, s, advisors, had, expected, france, to, betray, them, francis, stephen, urged, maria, theresa, to, reach, a, rapprochement, with, prussia, as, did, great, britain, maria, theresa, reluctantly, agreed, to, negotiations, contrary, to, all, expectations, the, young, queen, gained, significant, support, from, hungary, her, coronation, as, queen, of, hungary, suo, jure, took, place, in, st, martin, s, cathedral, pressburg, today, s, bratislava, on, 25, june, 1741, she, had, spent, months, honing, the, equestrian, skills, necessary, for, the, ceremony, and, negotiating, with, the, hungarian, diet, to, appease, those, who, considered, her, gender, to, be, a, serious, obstacle, maria, theresa, assumed, masculine, titles, thus, in, nomenclature, maria, theresa, was, archduke, and, king, normally, however, she, was, styled, as, queen, by, july, attempts, at, conciliation, had, completely, collapsed, maria, theresa, s, ally, augustus, iii, of, poland, now, became, her, enemy, and, george, ii, declared, the, electorate, of, hanover, to, be, neutral, therefore, she, needed, troops, from, hungary, in, order, to, support, the, war, effort, although, she, had, already, won, the, admiration, of, the, hungarians, the, number, of, volunteers, was, only, in, the, hundreds, since, she, required, them, in, thousands, or, even, tens, of, thousands, she, decided, to, appear, before, the, hungarian, diet, on, 11, september, 1741, while, wearing, the, holy, crown, of, hungary, she, began, addressing, the, diet, in, latin, and, she, asserted, that, the, very, existence, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, of, our, own, person, and, children, and, our, crown, are, at, stake, forsaken, by, all, we, place, our, sole, reliance, in, the, fidelity, and, long, tried, valor, of, the, hungarians, the, response, was, rather, boorish, with, the, queen, being, questioned, and, even, heckled, by, members, of, the, diet, someone, cried, that, she, better, apply, to, satan, than, the, hungarians, for, help, however, she, managed, to, show, her, gift, for, theatrical, displays, by, holding, her, son, and, heir, joseph, while, weeping, and, she, dramatically, consigned, the, future, king, to, the, defense, of, the, brave, hungarians, this, act, managed, to, win, the, sympathy, of, the, members, and, they, declared, that, they, would, die, for, maria, theresa, in, 1741, the, austrian, authorities, informed, maria, theresa, that, the, bohemian, populace, would, prefer, charles, albert, elector, of, bavaria, to, her, as, sovereign, maria, theresa, desperate, and, burdened, by, pregnancy, wrote, plaintively, to, her, sister, i, don, t, know, if, a, town, will, remain, to, me, for, my, delivery, she, bitterly, vowed, to, spare, nothing, and, no, one, to, defend, her, kingdom, when, she, wrote, to, the, bohemian, chancellor, count, philip, kinsky, my, mind, is, made, up, we, must, put, everything, at, stake, to, save, bohemia, on, 26, october, the, elector, of, bavaria, captured, prague, and, declared, himself, king, of, bohemia, maria, theresa, then, in, hungary, wept, on, learning, of, the, loss, of, bohemia, charles, albert, was, unanimously, elected, holy, roman, emperor, as, charles, vii, on, 24, january, 1742, which, made, him, the, only, non, habsburg, to, be, in, that, position, since, 1440, the, queen, who, regarded, the, election, as, a, catastrophe, caught, her, enemies, unprepared, by, insisting, on, a, winter, campaign, the, same, day, he, was, elected, emperor, austrian, troops, under, ludwig, andreas, von, khevenh, ller, captured, munich, charles, albert, s, capital, she, has, as, you, well, know, a, terrible, hatred, for, france, with, which, nation, it, is, most, difficult, for, her, to, keep, on, good, terms, but, she, controls, this, passion, except, when, she, thinks, to, her, advantage, to, display, it, she, detests, your, majesty, but, acknowledges, your, ability, she, cannot, forget, the, loss, of, silesia, nor, her, grief, over, the, soldiers, she, lost, in, wars, with, you, prussian, ambassador, s, letter, to, frederick, the, great, the, treaty, of, breslau, of, june, 1742, ended, hostilities, between, austria, and, prussia, with, the, first, silesian, war, at, an, end, the, queen, soon, made, the, recovery, of, bohemia, her, priority, french, troops, fled, bohemia, in, the, winter, of, the, same, year, on, 12, may, 1743, maria, theresa, was, crowned, queen, of, bohemia, in, st, vitus, cathedral, suo, jure, prussia, became, anxious, at, austrian, advances, on, the, rhine, frontier, and, frederick, again, invaded, bohemia, beginning, a, second, silesian, war, prussian, troops, sacked, prague, in, august, 1744, the, french, plans, fell, apart, when, charles, vii, died, in, january, 1745, the, french, overran, the, austrian, netherlands, in, may, francis, stephen, was, elected, holy, roman, emperor, on, 13, september, 1745, prussia, recognised, francis, as, emperor, and, maria, theresa, once, again, recognised, the, loss, of, silesia, with, the, exception, of, austrian, silesia, by, the, treaty, of, dresden, in, december, 1745, ending, the, second, silesian, war, the, wider, war, dragged, on, for, another, three, years, with, fighting, in, northern, italy, and, the, austrian, netherlands, however, the, core, habsburg, domains, of, austria, hungary, and, bohemia, remained, in, maria, theresa, s, possession, the, treaty, of, aix, la, chappelle, which, concluded, the, eight, year, conflict, recognised, prussia, s, possession, of, silesia, and, maria, theresa, ceded, the, duchy, of, parma, to, philip, of, spain, france, had, successfully, conquered, the, austrian, netherlands, but, louis, xv, wishing, to, prevent, potential, future, wars, with, austria, returned, them, to, maria, theresa, frederick, of, prussia, s, invasion, of, saxony, in, august, 1756, began, a, third, silesian, war, and, sparked, the, wider, seven, years, war, maria, theresa, and, prince, kaunitz, wished, to, exit, the, war, with, possession, of, silesia, before, the, war, started, kaunitz, had, been, sent, as, an, ambassador, to, versailles, from, 1750, to, 1753, to, win, over, the, french, meanwhile, the, british, rebuffed, requests, from, maria, theresa, to, aid, her, in, reclaiming, silesia, and, frederick, ii, himself, managed, to, secure, the, treaty, of, westminster, 1756, with, them, subsequently, maria, theresa, sent, georg, adam, prince, of, starhemberg, to, negotiate, an, agreement, with, france, and, the, result, was, the, first, treaty, of, versailles, of, 1, may, 1756, thus, the, efforts, of, kaunitz, and, starhemberg, managed, to, pave, a, way, for, a, diplomatic, revolution, previously, france, was, one, of, austria, s, archenemies, together, with, russia, and, the, ottoman, empire, but, after, the, agreement, they, were, united, by, a, common, cause, against, prussia, however, historians, have, blamed, this, treaty, for, france, s, devastating, defeats, in, the, war, since, louis, xv, was, required, to, deploy, troops, in, germany, and, to, provide, subsidies, of, 25, 30, million, pounds, a, year, to, maria, theresa, that, were, vital, for, the, austrian, war, effort, in, bohemia, and, silesia, on, 1, may, 1757, the, second, treaty, of, versailles, was, signed, whereby, louis, xv, promised, to, provide, austria, with, 130, 000, men, in, addition, to, 12, million, florins, yearly, they, would, also, continue, the, war, in, continental, europe, until, prussia, could, be, compelled, to, abandon, silesia, and, glatz, in, return, austria, would, cede, several, towns, in, the, austrian, netherlands, to, the, son, in, law, of, louis, xv, philip, of, parma, who, in, turn, would, grant, his, italian, duchies, to, maria, theresa, maximilian, von, browne, commanded, the, austrian, troops, following, the, indecisive, battle, of, lobositz, in, 1756, he, was, replaced, by, prince, charles, alexander, of, lorraine, maria, theresa, s, brother, in, law, however, he, was, appointed, only, because, of, his, familial, relations, he, turned, out, to, be, an, incompetent, military, leader, and, he, was, replaced, by, leopold, joseph, von, daun, franz, moritz, von, lacy, and, ernst, gideon, von, laudon, frederick, himself, was, startled, by, lobositz, he, eventually, re, grouped, for, another, attack, in, june, 1757, the, battle, of, kol, n, that, followed, was, a, decisive, victory, for, austria, frederick, lost, one, third, of, his, troops, and, before, the, battle, was, over, he, had, left, the, scene, subsequently, prussia, was, defeated, at, hochkirch, in, saxony, on, 14, october, 1758, at, kunersdorf, in, brandenburg, on, 12, august, 1759, and, at, landeshut, near, glatz, in, june, 1760, hungarian, and, croat, light, hussars, led, by, count, hadik, raided, berlin, in, 1757, austrian, and, russian, troops, even, occupied, berlin, for, several, days, in, august, 1760, however, these, victories, did, not, enable, the, habsburgs, to, win, the, war, as, the, french, and, habsburg, armies, were, destroyed, by, frederick, at, rossbach, in, 1757, after, the, defeat, in, torgau, on, 3, november, 1760, maria, theresa, realised, that, she, could, no, longer, reclaim, silesia, without, russian, support, which, vanished, after, the, death, of, empress, elizabeth, in, early, 1762, in, the, meantime, france, was, losing, badly, in, america, and, india, and, thus, they, had, reduced, their, subsidies, by, 50, since, 1761, kaunitz, had, tried, to, organise, a, diplomatic, congress, to, take, advantage, of, the, accession, of, george, iii, of, great, britain, as, he, did, not, really, care, about, germany, finally, the, war, was, concluded, by, the, treaty, of, hubertusburg, and, paris, in, 1763, austria, had, to, leave, the, prussian, territories, that, were, occupied, although, silesia, remained, under, the, control, of, prussia, a, new, balance, of, power, was, created, in, europe, and, austrian, position, was, strengthened, by, it, thanks, to, its, alliance, with, the, bourbons, in, madrid, parma, and, naples, maria, theresa, herself, decided, to, focus, on, domestic, reforms, and, refrain, from, undertaking, any, further, military, operations, maria, theresa, gave, birth, to, sixteen, children, in, nineteen, years, from, 1737, to, 1756, thirteen, survived, infancy, but, only, ten, survived, into, adulthood, the, first, child, maria, elisabeth, 1737, 1740, was, born, a, little, less, than, a, year, after, the, wedding, the, child, s, sex, caused, great, disappointment, and, so, would, the, births, of, maria, anna, the, eldest, surviving, child, and, maria, carolina, 1740, 1741, while,

during, the, seven, years, war, aged, 39, maria, theresa, asserted, that, had, she, not, been, almost, always, pregnant, she, would, have, gone, into, battle, herself, four, of, maria, theresa, s, children, died, before, reaching, adolescence, her, eldest, daughter, maria, elisabeth, died, from, stomach, cramps, at, the, age, of, three, her, third, child, the, first, of, three, daughters, named, maria, carolina, died, shortly, after, her, first, birthday, the, second, maria, carolina, was, born, feet, first, in, 1748, as, it, became, evident, that, she, would, not, survive, preparations, were, hastily, made, to, baptize, her, while, still, living, according, to, traditional, catholic, belief, unbaptized, infants, would, be, condemned, to, eternity, in, limbo, maria, theresa, s, physician, gerard, van, swieten, assured, her, that, the, infant, was, still, living, when, baptized, but, many, at, court, doubted, this, maria, theresa, s, mother, empress, elisabeth, christine, died, in, 1750, four, years, later, maria, theresa, s, governess, marie, karoline, von, fuchs, mollard, died, she, showed, her, gratitude, to, countess, fuchs, by, having, her, buried, in, the, imperial, crypt, along, with, the, members, of, the, imperial, family, smallpox, was, a, constant, threat, to, members, of, the, royal, family, in, july, 1749, maria, christina, survived, a, bout, of, the, disease, followed, in, january, 1757, by, maria, theresa, s, eldest, son, joseph, in, january, 1761, the, disease, killed, her, second, son, charles, at, the, age, of, fifteen, in, december, 1762, her, twelve, year, old, daughter, johanna, likewise, died, in, agony, from, the, disease, in, november, 1763, joseph, s, first, wife, isabella, died, from, the, disease, joseph, s, second, wife, empress, maria, josepha, likewise, caught, the, disease, in, may, 1767, and, died, a, week, later, maria, theresa, ignored, the, risk, of, infection, and, embraced, her, daughter, in, law, before, the, sick, chamber, was, sealed, to, outsiders, maria, theresa, in, fact, contracted, smallpox, from, her, daughter, in, law, throughout, the, city, prayers, were, made, for, her, recovery, and, the, sacrament, was, displayed, in, all, churches, joseph, slept, in, one, of, his, mother, s, antechambers, and, hardly, left, her, bedside, on, 1, june, maria, theresa, was, given, the, last, rites, when, the, news, came, in, early, june, that, she, had, survived, the, crisis, there, was, huge, rejoicing, at, the, court, and, amongst, the, populace, of, vienna, in, october, 1767, maria, theresa, s, sixteen, year, old, daughter, josepha, also, showed, signs, of, the, disease, it, was, assumed, that, she, had, caught, the, infection, when, she, went, with, her, mother, to, pray, in, the, imperial, crypt, next, to, the, unsealed, tomb, of, empress, maria, josepha, joseph, s, wife, archduchess, josepha, started, showing, smallpox, rash, two, days, after, visiting, the, crypt, and, soon, died, maria, carolina, was, to, replace, her, as, the, pre, determined, bride, of, king, ferdinand, iv, of, naples, maria, theresa, blamed, herself, for, her, daughter, s, death, for, the, rest, of, her, life, because, at, the, time, the, concept, of, an, extended, incubation, period, was, largely, unknown, and, it, was, believed, that, josepha, had, caught, smallpox, from, the, body, of, the, late, empress, the, last, in, the, family, to, be, infected, with, the, illness, was, the, twenty, four, year, old, elisabeth, although, she, recovered, she, was, badly, scarred, with, pock, marks, from, the, illness, maria, theresa, s, losses, to, smallpox, especially, in, the, epidemic, of, 1767, were, decisive, in, her, sponsoring, trials, to, prevent, the, illness, through, inoculation, and, subsequently, insisting, on, members, of, the, imperial, family, receiving, inoculation, shortly, after, giving, birth, to, the, younger, children, maria, theresa, was, confronted, with, the, task, of, marrying, off, the, elder, ones, she, led, the, marriage, negotiations, along, with, the, campaigns, of, her, wars, and, the, duties, of, state, she, used, them, as, pawns, in, dynastic, games, and, sacrificed, their, happiness, for, the, benefit, of, the, state, a, devoted, but, self, conscious, mother, she, wrote, to, all, of, her, children, at, least, once, a, week, and, believed, herself, entitled, to, exercise, authority, over, her, children, regardless, of, their, age, and, rank, in, april, 1770, maria, theresa, s, youngest, daughter, maria, antonia, married, louis, dauphin, of, france, by, proxy, in, vienna, maria, antonia, s, education, was, neglected, and, when, the, french, showed, an, interest, in, her, her, mother, went, about, educating, her, as, best, she, could, about, the, court, of, versailles, and, the, french, maria, theresa, kept, up, a, fortnightly, correspondence, with, maria, antonia, now, called, marie, antoinette, in, which, she, often, reproached, her, for, laziness, and, frivolity, and, scolded, her, for, failing, to, conceive, a, child, maria, theresa, was, not, just, critical, of, marie, antoinette, she, disliked, leopold, s, reserve, and, often, blamed, him, for, being, cold, she, criticized, maria, carolina, for, her, political, activities, ferdinand, for, his, lack, of, organization, and, maria, amalia, for, her, poor, french, and, haughtiness, the, only, child, she, did, not, constantly, scold, was, maria, christina, who, enjoyed, her, mother, s, complete, confidence, though, she, failed, to, please, her, mother, in, one, aspect, she, did, not, produce, any, surviving, children, one, of, maria, theresa, s, greatest, wishes, was, to, have, as, many, grandchildren, as, possible, but, she, had, only, about, two, dozen, at, the, time, of, her, death, of, which, all, the, eldest, surviving, daughters, were, named, after, her, with, the, exception, of, princess, carolina, of, parma, her, eldest, granddaughter, by, maria, amalia, like, all, members, of, the, house, of, habsburg, maria, theresa, was, a, catholic, and, a, devout, one, she, believed, that, religious, unity, was, necessary, for, a, peaceful, public, life, and, explicitly, rejected, the, idea, of, religious, toleration, she, even, advocated, for, a, state, church, and, contemporary, travelers, criticized, her, regime, as, bigoted, intolerant, and, superstitious, however, she, never, allowed, the, church, to, interfere, with, what, she, considered, to, be, prerogatives, of, a, monarch, and, kept, rome, at, arm, s, length, she, controlled, the, selection, of, archbishops, bishops, and, abbots, overall, the, ecclesiastical, policies, of, maria, theresa, were, enacted, to, ensure, the, primacy, of, state, control, in, church, state, relations, she, was, also, influenced, by, jansenist, ideas, one, of, the, most, important, aspects, of, jansenism, was, the, advocacy, of, maximum, freedom, of, national, churches, from, rome, although, austria, had, always, stressed, the, rights, of, the, state, in, relation, to, the, church, jansenism, provided, new, theoretical, justification, for, this, maria, theresa, promoted, the, greek, catholics, and, emphasized, their, equal, status, with, latin, church, catholics, although, maria, theresa, was, a, very, pious, person, she, also, enacted, policies, that, suppressed, exaggerated, display, of, piety, such, as, the, prohibition, of, public, flagellantism, furthermore, she, significantly, reduced, the, number, of, religious, holidays, and, monastic, orders, her, relationship, with, the, jesuits, was, complex, members, of, this, order, educated, her, served, as, her, confessors, and, supervised, the, religious, education, of, her, eldest, son, the, jesuits, were, powerful, and, influential, in, the, early, years, of, maria, theresa, s, reign, however, the, queen, s, ministers, convinced, her, that, the, order, posed, a, danger, to, her, monarchical, authority, not, without, much, hesitation, and, regret, she, issued, a, decree, that, removed, them, from, all, the, institutions, of, the, monarchy, and, carried, it, out, thoroughly, she, forbade, the, publication, of, pope, clement, xiii, s, apostolicum, pascendi, bull, which, was, in, favour, of, the, jesuits, and, promptly, confiscated, their, property, when, pope, clement, xiv, suppressed, the, order, maria, theresa, regarded, both, the, jews, and, protestants, as, dangerous, to, the, state, and, actively, tried, to, suppress, them, she, was, probably, the, most, anti, jewish, monarch, of, her, time, having, inherited, the, traditional, prejudices, of, her, ancestors, and, acquired, new, ones, this, was, a, product, of, commonplace, antisemitism, and, was, not, kept, secret, in, her, time, in, 1777, she, wrote, of, the, jews, i, know, of, no, greater, plague, than, this, race, which, on, account, of, its, deceit, usury, and, avarice, is, driving, my, subjects, into, beggary, therefore, as, far, as, possible, the, jews, are, to, be, kept, away, and, avoided, her, animosity, was, such, that, she, was, willing, to, tolerate, protestant, businessmen, and, financiers, in, vienna, such, as, the, swiss, born, johann, von, fries, since, she, wanted, to, break, free, from, the, jewish, financiers, in, december, 1744, she, proposed, to, her, ministers, the, expulsion, of, around, 10, 000, jews, from, prague, amid, accusations, that, they, were, disloyal, at, the, time, of, the, bavarian, french, occupation, during, the, war, of, the, austrian, succession, the, order, was, then, expanded, to, all, jews, of, bohemia, and, major, cities, of, moravia, her, first, intention, was, to, deport, all, jews, by, 1, january, but, having, accepted, the, advice, of, her, ministers, had, the, deadline, postponed, the, expulsion, was, executed, only, for, prague, and, only, retracted, in, 1748, due, to, economic, considerations, and, pressures, from, other, countries, including, great, britain, in, the, third, decade, of, her, reign, maria, theresa, issued, edicts, that, offered, some, state, protection, to, her, jewish, subjects, she, forbade, the, forcible, conversion, of, jewish, children, to, christianity, in, 1762, and, in, 1763, she, forbade, catholic, clergy, from, extracting, surplice, fees, from, her, jewish, subjects, in, 1764, she, ordered, the, release, of, those, jews, who, had, been, jailed, for, a, blood, libel, in, the, village, of, orkuta, notwithstanding, her, continuing, strong, dislike, of, jews, maria, theresa, supported, jewish, commercial, and, industrial, activity, in, austria, there, were, also, parts, of, the, realm, where, the, jews, were, treated, better, such, as, trieste, gorizia, and, vorarlberg, in, contrast, to, maria, theresa, s, efforts, to, expel, the, jews, she, aimed, to, convert, the, protestants, whom, she, regarded, as, heretics, to, catholicism, commissions, were, formed, to, seek, out, secret, protestants, and, intern, them, in, workhouses, where, they, would, be, given, the, chance, to, subscribe, to, approved, statements, of, catholic, faith, if, they, accepted, they, were, to, be, allowed, to, return, to, their, homes, however, any, sign, of, a, return, to, protestant, practice, was, treated, harshly, often, by, exile, maria, theresa, exiled, protestants, from, austria, to, transylvania, including, 2, 600, from, upper, austria, in, the, 1750s, her, son, and, co, ruler, joseph, regarded, his, mother, s, religious, policies, as, unjust, impious, impossible, harmful, and, ridiculous, despite, her, policies, practical, demographic, and, economic, considerations, prevented, her, from, expelling, the, protestants, en, masse, in, 1777, she, abandoned, the, idea, of, expelling, moravian, protestants, after, joseph, who, was, opposed, to, her, intentions, threatened, to, abdicate, as, emperor, and, co, ruler, in, february, 1780, after, a, number, of, moravians, publicly, declared, their, faith, joseph, demanded, a, general, freedom, to, worship, however, maria, theresa, refused, to, grant, this, for, as, long, as, she, lived, in, may, 1780, a, group, of, moravians, who, had, assembled, for, a, worship, service, on, the, occasion, of, her, birthday, were, arrested, and, deported, to, hungary, freedom, of, religion, was, granted, only, in, the, declaration, of, tolerance, issued, by, joseph, immediately, after, maria, theresa, s, death, the, policies, of, maria, theresa, s, government, toward, their, eastern, orthodox, subjects, were, marked, by, special, interests, relating, not, only, to, complex, religious, situations, in, various, southern, and, eastern, regions, of, the, habsburg, monarchy, inhabited, by, eastern, orthodox, christians, mainly, serbs, and, romanians, but, also, regarding, the, political, aspirations, of, the, habsburg, court, toward, several, neighbouring, lands, and, regions, in, southeastern, europe, still, held, by, the, declining, ottoman, empire, and, inhabited, by, an, eastern, orthodox, population, maria, theresa, s, government, confirmed, 1743, and, continued, to, uphold, old, privileges, granted, to, their, eastern, orthodox, subjects, by, previous, habsburg, monarchs, emperors, leopold, i, joseph, i, and, charles, vi, but, at, the, same, time, new, reforms, were, enforced, establishing, much, firmer, state, control, over, the, serbian, orthodox, metropolitanate, of, karlovci, those, reforms, were, initiated, by, royal, patents, known, as, regulamentum, privilegiorum, 1770, and, regulamentum, illyricae, nationis, 1777, and, finalized, in, 1779, by, the, declaratory, rescript, of, the, illyrian, nation, a, comprehensive, document, that, regulated, all, major, issues, relating, to, the, religious, life, of, their, eastern, orthodox, subjects, and, the, administration, of, the, serbian, metropolitanate, of, karlovci, maria, theresa, s, rescript, of, 1779, was, kept, in, force, until, 1868, maria, theresa, was, as, conservative, in, matters, of, state, as, in, those, of, religion, but, she, implemented, significant, reforms, to, strengthen, austria, s, military, and, bureaucratic, efficiency, she, employed, friedrich, wilhelm, von, haugwitz, who, modernised, the, empire, by, creating, a, standing, army, of, 108, 000, men, paid, for, with, 14, million, florins, extracted, from, crown, lands, the, central, government, was, responsible, for, funding, the, army, although, haugwitz, instituted, taxation, of, the, nobility, who, had, never, before, had, to, pay, taxes, moreover, after, haugwitz, was, appointed, the, head, of, the, new, central, administrative, agency, dubbed, the, directory, directorium, in, publicis, et, cameralibus, in, 1749, he, initiated, a, radical, centralization, of, state, institutions, down, to, the, level, of, the, district, office, kreisamt, thanks, to, this, effort, by, 1760, there, was, a, class, of, government, officials, numbering, around, 10, 000, however, lombardy, the, austrian, netherlands, and, hungary, were, almost, completely, untouched, by, this, reform, in, the, case, of, hungary, maria, theresa, was, particularly, mindful, of, her, promise, that, she, would, respect, the, privileges, in, the, kingdom, including, the, immunity, of, nobles, from, taxation, in, light, of, the, failure, to, reclaim, silesia, during, the, seven, years, war, the, governing, system, was, once, again, reformed, to, strengthen, the, state, the, directory, was, transformed, into, the, united, austrian, and, bohemian, chancellery, in, 1761, which, was, equipped, with, a, separate, independent, judiciary, and, separate, financial, bodies, she, also, refounded, the, hofkammer, in, 1762, which, was, a, ministry, of, finances, that, controlled, all, revenues, from, the, monarchy, in, addition, to, this, the, hofrechenskammer, or, exchequer, was, tasked, with, the, handling, of, all, financial, accounts, meanwhile, in, 1760, maria, theresa, created, the, council, of, state, staatsrat, composed, of, the, state, chancellor, three, members, of, the, high, nobility, and, three, knights, which, served, as, a, committee, of, experienced, people, who, advised, her, the, council, of, state, lacked, executive, or, legislative, authority, nevertheless, it, showed, the, difference, between, the, form, of, government, employed, by, maria, theresa, and, that, of, frederick, ii, of, prussia, unlike, the, latter, maria, theresa, was, not, an, autocrat, who, acted, as, her, own, minister, prussia, would, adopt, this, form, of, government, only, after, 1807, maria, theresa, doubled, the, state, revenue, from, 20, to, 40, million, florins, between, 1754, and, 1764, though, her, attempt, to, tax, clergy, and, nobility, was, only, partially, successful, these, financial, reforms, greatly, improved, the, economy, after, kaunitz, became, the, head, of, the, new, staatsrat, he, pursued, a, policy, of, aristocratic, enlightenment, that, relied, on, persuasion, to, interact, with, the, estates, and, he, was, also, willing, to, retract, some, of, haugwitz, s, centralization, to, curry, favour, with, them, nonetheless, the, governing, system, remained, centralised, and, a, strong, institution, made, it, possible, for, kaunitz, to, increase, state, revenues, substantially, in, 1775, the, habsburg, monarchy, achieved, its, first, balanced, budget, and, by, 1780, the, habsburg, state, revenue, had, reached, 50, million, florins, after, maria, theresa, recruited, gerard, van, swieten, from, the, netherlands, he, also, employed, a, fellow, dutchman, named, anton, de, haen, who, founded, the, viennese, medicine, school, wiener, medizinische, schule, maria, theresa, also, banned, the, creation, of, new, burial, grounds, without, prior, government, permission, thus, countering, wasteful, and, unhygienic, burial, customs, after, the, smallpox, epidemic, of, 1767, she, promoted, inoculation, which, she, had, learned, of, through, her, correspondence, with, maria, antonia, electress, of, saxony, who, in, turn, probably, knew, of, it, through, her, own, correspondence, with, frederick, the, great, after, unsuccessfully, inviting, the, sutton, brothers, from, england, to, introduce, their, technique, in, austria, maria, theresa, obtained, information, on, current, practices, of, smallpox, inoculation, in, england, she, overrode, the, objections, of, gerard, van, swieten, who, doubted, the, effectiveness, of, the, technique, and, ordered, that, it, be, tried, on, thirty, four, newborn, orphans, and, sixty, seven, orphans, between, the, ages, of, five, and, fourteen, years, the, trial, was, successful, establishing, that, inoculation, was, effective, in, protecting, against, smallpox, and, safe, in, the, case, of, the, test, subjects, the, empress, therefore, ordered, the, construction, of, an, inoculation, centre, and, had, herself, and, two, of, her, children, inoculated, she, promoted, inoculation, in, austria, by, hosting, a, dinner, for, the, first, sixty, five, inoculated, children, in, sch, nbrunn, palace, waiting, on, the, children, herself, maria, theresa, was, responsible, for, changing, austrian, physicians, negative, view, of, inoculation, in, 1770, she, enacted, a, strict, regulation, of, the, sale, of, poisons, and, apothecaries, were, obliged, to, keep, a, poison, register, recording, the, quantity, and, circumstances, of, every, sale, if, someone, unknown, tried, to, purchase, a, poison, that, person, had, to, provide, two, character, witnesses, before, a, sale, could, be, effectuated, three, years, later, she, prohibited, the, use, of, lead, in, any, eating, or, drinking, vessels, the, only, permitted, material, for, this, purpose, was, pure, tin, she, is, most, unusually, ambitious, and, hopes, to, make, the, house, of, austria, more, renowned, than, it, has, ever, been, prussian, ambassador, s, letter, to, frederick, ii, of, prussia, the, centralization, of, the, habsburg, government, necessitated, the, creation, of, a, unified, legal, system, previously, various, lands, in, the, habsburg, realm, had, their, own, laws, these, laws, were, compiled, and, the, resulting, codex, theresianus, could, be, used, as, a, basis, for, legal, unification, in, 1769, the, constitutio, criminalis, theresiana, was, published, and, this, was, a, codification, of, the, traditional, criminal, justice, system, since, the, middle, ages, this, criminal, code, allowed, the, possibility, of, establishing, the, truth, through, torture, and, it, also, criminalised, witchcraft, and, various, religious, offenses, although, this, law, came, into, force, in, austria, and, bohemia, it, was, not, valid, in, hungary, maria, theresa, is, credited, however, in, ending, the, witch, hunts, in, zagreb, opposing, the, methods, used, against, magda, logomer, also, called, herrucina, who, was, the, last, prosecuted, witch, in, zagreb, following, her, intervention, she, was, particularly, concerned, with, the, sexual, morality, of, her, subjects, thus, she, established, a, chastity, commission, keuschheitskommission, in, 1752, to, clamp, down, on, prostitution, homosexuality, adultery, and, even, sex, between, members, of, different, religions, this, commission, cooperated, closely, with, the, police, and, the, commission, even, employed, secret, agents, to, investigate, private, lives, of, men, and, women, with, bad, reputation, they, were, authorised, to, raid, banquets, clubs, and, private, gatherings, and, to, arrest, those, suspected, of, violating, social, norms, the, punishments, included, whipping, deportation, or, even, the, death, penalty, in, 1776, austria, outlawed, torture, at, the, particular, behest, of, joseph, ii, much, unlike, joseph, but, with, the, support, of, religious, authorities, maria, theresa, was, opposed, to, the, abolition, of, torture, born, and, raised, between, baroque, and, rococo, eras, she, found, it, difficult, to, fit, into, the, intellectual, sphere, of, the, enlightenment, which, is, why, she, only, slowly, followed, humanitarian, reforms, on, the, continent, from, an, institutional, perspective, in, 1749, she, founded, the, supreme, judiciary, as, a, court, of, final, appeal, for, all, hereditary, lands, throughout, her, reign, maria, theresa, made, the, promotion, of, education, a, priority, initially, this, was, focused, on, the, wealthier, classes, she, permitted, non, catholics, to, attend, university, and, allowed, the, introduction, of, secular, subjects, such, as, law, which, influenced, the, decline, of, theology, as, the, main, foundation, of, university, education, furthermore, educational, institutions, were, created, to, prepare, officials, for, work, in, the, state, bureaucracy, the, theresianum, was, established, in, vienna, in, 1746, to, educate, nobles, sons, a, military, school, named, the, theresian, military, academy, was, founded, in, wiener, neustadt, in, 1751, and, an, oriental, academy, for, future, diplomats, was, created, in, 1754, in, the, 1770s, reform, of, the, schooling, system, for, all, levels, of, society, became, a, major, policy, stollberg, rilinger, notes, that, the, reform, of, the, primary, schools, in, particular, was, the, most, long, lasting, success, of, maria, theresa, s, later, reign, and, one, of, the, few, policy, agendas, in, which, she, was, not, in, open, conflict, with, her, son, and, nominal, co, ruler, joseph, ii, the, need, for, the, reform, became, evident, after, the, census, of, 1770, 1771, which, revealed, the, widespread, illiteracy, of, the, populace, maria, theresa, thereupon, wrote, to, her, rival, frederick, ii, of, prussia, to, request, him, to, allow, the, silesian, school, reformer, johann, ignaz, von, felbiger, to, move, to, austria, felbiger, s, first, proposals, were, made, law, by, december, 1774, austrian, historian, karl, vocelka, observed, that, the, educational, reforms, enacted, by, maria, theresa, were, really, founded, on, enlightenment, ideas, although, the, ulterior, motive, was, still, to, meet, the, needs, of, an, absolutist, state, as, an, increasingly, sophisticated, and, complicated, society, and, economy, required, new, administrators, officers, diplomats, and, specialists, in, virtually, every, area, maria, theresa, s, reform, established, secular, primary, schools, which, children, of, both, sexes, from, the, ages, of, six, to, twelve, were, required, to, attend, the, curriculum, focused, on, social, responsibility, social, discipline, work, ethic, and, the, use, of, reason, rather, than, mere, rote, learning, education, was, to, be, multilingual, children, were, to, be, instructed, first, in, their, mother, tongue, and, then, in, later, years, in, german, prizes, were, given, to, the, most, able, students, to, encourage, ability, attention, was, also, given, to, raising, the, status, and, pay, of, teachers, who, were, forbidden, to, take, on, outside, employment, teacher, training, colleges, were, established, to, train, teachers, in, the, latest, techniques, the, education, reform, was, met, with, considerable, opposition, predictably, some, of, this, came, from, peasants, who, wanted, the, children, to, work, in, the, fields, instead, maria, theresa, crushed, the, dissent, by, ordering, the, arrest, of, all, those, opposed, however, much, of, the, opposition, came, from, the, imperial, court, particularly, amongst, aristocrats, who, saw, their, power, threatened, by, the, reformers, or, those, who, feared, that, that, greater, literacy, would, expose, the, population, to, protestant, or, enlightenment, ideas, felbiger, s, reforms, were, nevertheless, pushed, through, as, a, result, of, the, consistent, support, of, maria, theresa, and, her, minister, franz, sales, greiner, the, reform, of, the, primary, schools, largely, met, maria, theresa, s, aim, of, raising, literacy, standards, as, evidenced, by, the, higher, proportions, of, children, who, attended, school, this, was, particularly, the, case, in, the, archdiocese, of, vienna, where, school, attendance, increased, from, 40, in, 1780, to, a, sensational, 94, by, 1807, nevertheless, high, rates, of, illiteracy, persisted, in, some, parts, of, austria, half, of, the, population, was, illiterate, well, into, the, 19th, century, the, teacher, training, colleges, in, particular, the, vienna, normal, school, produced, hundreds, of, new, teachers, who, spread, the, new, system, over, the, following, decades, however, the, number, of, secondary, schools, decreased, since, the, quantity, of, new, schools, founded, failed, to, make, up, for, the, numbers, of, jesuit, schools, abolished, as, a, result, secondary, schooling, became, more, exclusive, her, regime, was, also, known, for, institutionalising, censorship, of, publications, and, learning, english, author, sir, nathaniel, wraxall, once, wrote, from, vienna, he, injudicious, bigotry, of, the, empress, may, chiefly, be, attributed, the, deficiency, it, is, hardly, credible, how, many, books, and, productions, of, every, species, and, in, every, language, are, proscribed, by, her, not, only, voltaire, and, rousseau, are, included, in, the, list, from, the, immoral, tendency, or, licentious, nature, of, their, writings, but, many, authors, whom, we, consider, as, unexceptionable, or, harmless, experience, a, similar, treatment, the, censorship, particularly, affected, works, that, were, deemed, to, be, against, the, catholic, religion, ironically, for, this, purpose, she, was, aided, by, gerard, van, swieten, who, was, considered, to, be, an, enlightened, man, maria, theresa, endeavoured, to, increase, the, living, standards, and, quality, of, life, of, the, people, since, she, could, see, a, causal, link, between, peasant, living, standards, productivity, and, state, revenue, the, habsburg, government, under, her, rule, also, tried, to, strengthen, its, industry, through, government, interventions, after, the, loss, of, silesia, they, implemented, subsidies, and, trade, barriers, to, encourage, the, move, of, silesian, textile, industry, to, northern, bohemia, in, addition, they, cut, back, guild, privileges, and, internal, duties, on, trade, were, either, reformed, or, removed, such, as, the, case, for, the, austrian, bohemian, lands, in, 1775, in, the, late, part, of, her, reign, maria, theresa, undertook, reform, of, the, system, of, serfdom, which, was, the, basis, for, agriculture, in, eastern, parts, of, her, lands, particularly, bohemia, moravia, hungary, and, galicia, although, maria, theresa, had, initially, been, reluctant, to, meddle, in, such, affairs, government, interventions, were, made, possible, by, the, perceived, need, for, economic, power, and, the, emergence, of, a, functioning, bureaucracy, the, census, of, 1770, 1771, gave, the, peasants, opportunity, to, express, their, grievances, directly, to, the, royal, commissioners, and, made, evident, to, maria, theresa, the, extent, to, which, their, poverty, was, the, result, of, the, extreme, demands, for, forced, labour, called, robota, in, czech, by, the, landlords, on, some, estates, the, landlords, demanded, that, the, peasants, work, up, to, seven, days, per, week, in, tilling, the, nobles, land, so, that, the, only, time, available, for, the, peasants, to, till, their, own, land, was, at, night, an, additional, prompt, to, reform, was, the, famine, which, afflicted, the, empire, in, the, early, 1770s, bohemia, was, particularly, hard, hit, maria, theresa, was, increasingly, influenced, by, the, reformers, franz, anton, von, blanc, and, tobias, philipp, von, gebler, who, called, for, radical, changes, to, the, serf, system, to, allow, the, peasants, to, make, a, living, in, 1771, 1778, maria, theresa, issued, a, series, of, robot, patents, i, e, regulations, regarding, forced, labour, which, regulated, and, restricted, peasant, labour, only, in, the, german, and, bohemian, parts, of, the, realm, the, goal, was, to, ensure, that, peasants, not, only, could, support, themselves, and, their, family, members, but, also, help, cover, the, national, expenditure, in, peace, or, war, by, late, 1772, maria, theresa, had, decided, on, more, radical, reform, in, 1773, she, entrusted, her, minister, franz, anton, von, raab, with, a, model, project, on, the, crown, lands, in, bohemia, he, was, tasked, to, divide, up, the, large, estates, into, small, farms, convert, the, forced, labour, contracts, into, leases, and, enable, the, farmers, to, pass, the, leaseholds, onto, their, children, raab, pushed, the, project, through, so, successfully, that, his, name, was, identified, with, the, program, which, became, known, as, raabisation, after, the, success, of, the, program, on, the, crown, lands, maria, theresa, had, it, also, implemented, on, the, former, jesuit, lands, as, well, as, crown, lands, in, other, parts, of, her, empire, however, maria, theresa, s, attempts, to, extend, the, raab, system, to, the, great, estates, belonging, to, the, bohemian, nobles, were, fiercely, resisted, by, the, nobles, they, claimed, that, the, crown, had, no, right, to, interfere, with, the, serf, system, since, the, nobles, were, the, original, owners, of, the, land, and, had, allowed, the, peasants, to, work, it, on, stipulated, conditions, the, nobles, also, claimed, that, the, system, of, forced, labour, had, no, connection, with, the, peasants, poverty, which, was, a, result, of, the, peasants, own, wastefulness, and, the, increased, royal, taxes, somewhat, surprisingly, the, nobles, were, supported, by, maria, theresa, s, son, and, co, ruler, joseph, ii, who, had, earlier, called, for, the, abolition, of, serfdom, in, a, letter, to, his, brother, leopold, of, 1775, joseph, complained, that, his, mother, intended, to, abolish, serfdom, entirely, and, arbitrarily, destroy, the, centuries, old, property, relations, he, complained, that, no, consideration, was, being, taken, for, the, landlords, who, were, threatened, with, the, loss, of, more, than, half, their, income, for, many, of, them, who, are, carrying, debts, this, would, mean, financial, ruin, by, 1776, the, court, was, polarized, on, one, side, was, a, small, reform, party, including, maria, theresa, raab, blanc, gebler, and, greiner, on, the, conservative, side, were, joseph, and, the, rest, of, the, court, joseph, argued, that, it, was, difficult, to, find, a, middle, way, between, the, interests, of, the, peasants, and, nobles, he, suggested, instead, that, the, peasants, negotiate, with, their, landlords, to, reach, an, outcome, joseph, s, biographer, derek, beales, calls, this, change, of, course, puzzling, in, the, ensuing, struggle, joseph, forced, blanc, to, leave, the, court, because, of, the, opposition, maria, theresa, was, unable, to, carry, out, the, planned, reform, and, had, to, settle, on, a, compromise, the, system, of, serfdom, was, only, abolished, after, maria, theresa, s, death, in, the, serfdom, patent, 1781, issued, in, another, change, of, course, by, joseph, ii, as, sole, ruler, emperor, francis, died, on, 18, august, 1765, while, he, and, the, court, were, in, innsbruck, celebrating, the, wedding, of, his, second, surviving, son, leopold, maria, theresa, was, devastated, their, eldest, son, joseph, became, holy, roman, emperor, maria, theresa, abandoned, all, ornamentation, had, her, hair, cut, short, painted, her, rooms, black, and, dressed, in, mourning, for, the, rest, of, her, life, she, completely, withdrew, from, court, life, public, events, and, theater, throughout, her, widowhood, she, spent, the, whole, of, august, and, the, eighteenth, of, each, month, alone, in, her, chamber, which, negatively, affected, her, mental, health, she, described, her, state, of, mind, shortly, after, francis, s, death, i, hardly, know, myself, now, for, i, have, become, like, an, animal, with, no, true, life, or, reasoning, power, upon, his, accession, to, the, imperial, throne, joseph, ruled, less, land, than, his, father, had, in, 1740, since, he, had, given, up, his, rights, over, tuscany, to, leopold, and, thus, he, only, controlled, falkenstein, and, teschen, believing, that, the, emperor, must, possess, enough, land, to, maintain, his, standing, as, emperor, maria, theresa, who, was, used, to, being, assisted, in, the, administration, of, her, vast, realms, declared, joseph, to, be, her, new, co, ruler, on, 17, september, 1765, from, then, on, mother, and, son, had, frequent, ideological, disagreements, the, 22, million, florins, that, joseph, inherited, from, his, father, was, injected, into, the, treasury, maria, theresa, had, another, loss, in, february, 1766, when, haugwitz, died, she, gave, her, son, absolute, control, over, the, military, following, the, death, of, leopold, joseph, von, daun, according, to, austrian, historian, robert, a, kann, maria, theresa, was, a, monarch, of, above, average, qualifications, but, intellectually, inferior, to, joseph, and, leopold, kann, asserts, that, she, nevertheless, possessed, qualities, appreciated, in, a, monarch, warm, heart, practical, mind, firm, determination, and, sound, perception, most, importantly, she, was, ready, to, recognise, the, mental, superiority, of, some, of, her, advisers, and, to, give, way, to, a, superior, mind, while, enjoying, support, of, her, ministers, even, if, their, ideas, differed, from, her, own, joseph, however, was, never, able, to, establish, rapport, with, the, same, advisers, even, though, their, philosophy, of, government, was, closer, to, joseph, s, than, to, maria, theresa, s, the, relationship, between, maria, theresa, and, joseph, was, not, without, warmth, but, was, complicated, and, their, personalities, clashed, despite, his, intellect, maria, theresa, s, force, of, personality, often, made, joseph, cower, sometimes, she, openly, admired, his, talents, and, achievements, but, she, was, also, not, hesitant, to, rebuke, him, she, even, wrote, we, never, see, each, other, except, at, dinner, his, temper, gets, worse, every, day, please, burn, this, letter, i, just, try, to, avoid, public, scandal, in, another, letter, also, addressed, to, joseph, s, companion, she, complained, he, avoids, me, i, am, the, only, person, in, his, way, and, so, i, am, an, obstruction, and, a, burden, abdication, alone, can, remedy, matters, after, much, contemplation, she, chose, not, to, abdicate, joseph, himself, often, threatened, to, resign, as, co, regent, and, emperor, but, he, too, was, induced, not, to, do, so, her, threats, of, abdication, were, rarely, taken, seriously, maria, theresa, believed, that, her, recovery, from, smallpox, in, 1767, was, a, sign, that, god, wished, her, to, reign, until, death, it, was, in, joseph, s, interest, that, she, remained, sovereign, for, he, often, blamed, her, for, his, failures, and, thus, avoided, taking, on, the, responsibilities, of, a, monarch, joseph, and, prince, kaunitz, arranged, the, first, partition, of, poland, despite, maria, theresa, s, protestations, her, sense, of, justice, pushed, her, to, reject, the, idea, of, partition, which, would, hurt, the, polish, people, she, even, once, argued, what, right, have, we, to, rob, an, innocent, nation, that, it, has, hitherto, been, our, boast, to, protect, and, support, the, duo, argued, that, it, was, too, late, to, abort, now, besides, maria, theresa, herself, agreed, with, the, partition, when, she, realised, that, frederick, ii, of, prussia, and, catherine, ii, of, russia, would, do, it, with, or, without, austrian, participation, maria, theresa, claimed, and, eventually, took, galicia, and, lodomeria, in, the, words, of, frederick, the, more, she, cried, the, more, she, took, a, few, years, after, the, partition, russia, defeated, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, russo, turkish, war, 1768, 1774, following, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, k, k, kaynarca, in, 1774, that, concluded, the, war, austria, entered, into, negotiations, with, the, sublime, porte, thus, in, 1775, the, ottoman, empire, ceded, the, northwestern, part, of, moldavia, subsequently, known, as, bukovina, to, austria, subsequently, on, 30, december, 1777, maximilian, iii, joseph, elector, of, bavaria, died, without, leaving, any, children, as, a, result, his, territories, were, coveted, by, ambitious, men, including, joseph, who, tried, to, swap, bavaria, for, the, austrian, netherlands, this, alarmed, frederick, ii, of, prussia, and, thus, the, war, of, the, bavarian, succession, erupted, in, 1778, maria, theresa, very, unwillingly, consented, to, the, occupation, of, bavaria, and, a, year, later, she, made, peace, proposals, to, frederick, ii, despite, joseph, s, objections, although, austria, managed, to, gain, the, innviertel, area, this, potato, war, caused, a, setback, to, the, financial, improvement, that, the, empress, had, made, the, 500, 000, florins, in, annual, revenue, from, 100, 000, inhabitants, of, innviertel, were, not, comparable, to, the, 100, 000, 000, florins, that, were, spent, during, the, war, it, is, unlikely, that, maria, theresa, ever, completely, recovered, from, the, smallpox, attack, in, 1767, as, 18th, century, writers, asserted, she, suffered, from, shortness, of, breath, fatigue, cough, distress, necrophobia, and, insomnia, she, later, developed, edema, maria, theresa, fell, ill, on, 24, november, 1780, her, physician, dr, st, rk, thought, her, condition, serious, although, her, son, joseph, was, confident, that, she, would, recover, in, no, time, by, 26, november, she, asked, for, the, last, rites, and, on, 28, november, the, doctor, told, her, that, the, time, had, come, on, 29, november, she, died, surrounded, by, her, remaining, children, her, body, is, buried, in, the, imperial, crypt, in, vienna, next, to, her, husband, in, a, coffin, she, had, inscribed, during, her, lifetime, her, longtime, rival, frederick, the, great, on, hearing, of, her, death, said, that, she, had, honored, her, throne, and, her, sex, and, although, he, had, fought, against, her, in, three, wars, he, never, considered, her, his, enemy, with, her, death, the, house, of, habsburg, died, out, and, was, replaced, by, the, house, of, habsburg, lorraine, joseph, ii, already, co, sovereign, of, the, habsburg, dominions, succeeded, her, and, introduced, sweeping, reforms, in, the, empire, joseph, produced, nearly, 700, edicts, per, year, or, almost, two, per, day, whereas, maria, theresa, issued, only, about, 100, edicts, annually, maria, theresa, understood, the, importance, of, her, public, persona, and, was, able, to, simultaneously, evoke, both, esteem, and, affection, in, her, subjects, a, notable, example, was, how, she, projected, dignity, and, simplicity, to, awe, the, people, in, pressburg, before, she, was, crowned, as, queen, regnant, of, hungary, her, 40, year, reign, was, considered, to, be, very, successful, when, compared, to, other, habsburg, rulers, her, reforms, had, transformed, the, empire, into, a, modern, state, with, a, significant, international, standing, she, centralised, and, modernised, its, institutions, and, her, reign, was, considered, as, the, beginning, of, the, era, of, enlightened, absolutism, in, austria, with, a, brand, new, approach, toward, governing, the, measures, undertaken, by, rulers, became, more, modern, and, rational, and, thoughts, were, given, to, the, welfare, of, the, state, and, the, people, many, of, her, policies, were, not, in, line, with, the, ideals, of, the, enlightenment, such, as, her, support, of, torture, and, she, was, still, very, much, influenced, by, catholicism, from, the, previous, era, vocelka, even, stated, that, taken, as, a, whole, the, reforms, of, maria, theresa, appear, more, absolutist, and, centralist, than, enlightened, even, if, one, must, admit, that, the, influence, of, enlightened, ideas, is, visible, to, a, certain, degree, despite, being, among, the, most, successful, habsburg, monarchs, and, remarkable, leaders, of, the, 18th, century, maria, theresa, has, not, captured, the, interest, of, contemporary, historians, or, media, perhaps, due, her, hardened, nature, a, number, of, streets, and, squares, were, named, after, her, throughout, the, empire, as, well, as, statues, and, monuments, built, in, vienna, a, large, bronze, monument, was, built, in, her, honour, at, maria, theresien, platz, in, 1888, the, maria, theresia, garden, square, uzhhorod, was, constructed, in, her, memory, as, recently, as, 2013, the, city, of, subotica, was, renamed, in, her, honor, in, 1779, as, maria, theresiapolis, sometimes, spelled, as, maria, theresiopel, or, theresiopel, a, number, of, her, descendants, were, named, in, her, honour, these, include, she, has, appeared, as, the, main, figure, in, a, number, of, films, and, series, such, as, the, 1951, maria, theresa, and, maria, theresia, an, austria, czech, television, miniseries, from, 2017, in, the, 2006, film, marie, antoinette, marianne, faithfull,
