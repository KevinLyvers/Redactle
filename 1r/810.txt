niccol, di, bernardo, dei, machiavelli, 3, may, 1469, 21, june, 1527, was, a, florentine, diplomat, author, philosopher, and, historian, who, lived, during, the, italian, renaissance, he, is, best, known, for, his, political, treatise, the, prince, il, principe, written, around, 1513, but, not, published, until, 1532, five, years, after, his, death, he, has, often, been, called, the, father, of, modern, political, philosophy, and, political, science, for, many, years, he, served, as, a, senior, official, in, the, florentine, republic, with, responsibilities, in, diplomatic, and, military, affairs, he, wrote, comedies, carnival, songs, and, poetry, his, personal, correspondence, is, also, important, to, historians, and, scholars, of, italian, correspondence, he, worked, as, secretary, to, the, second, chancery, of, the, republic, of, florence, from, 1498, to, 1512, when, the, medici, were, out, of, power, after, his, death, machiavelli, s, name, came, to, evoke, unscrupulous, acts, of, the, sort, he, advised, most, famously, in, his, work, the, prince, he, claimed, that, his, experience, and, reading, of, history, showed, him, that, politics, has, always, involved, deception, treachery, and, crime, he, also, notably, said, that, a, ruler, who, is, establishing, a, kingdom, or, a, republic, and, is, criticized, for, his, deeds, including, violence, should, be, excused, when, the, intention, and, the, result, are, beneficial, to, him, machiavelli, s, prince, has, been, surrounded, by, controversy, since, it, was, published, some, consider, it, to, be, a, straightforward, description, of, political, reality, others, view, the, prince, as, a, manual, teaching, would, be, tyrants, how, they, should, seize, and, maintain, power, even, into, recent, times, some, scholars, such, as, leo, strauss, have, restated, the, traditional, opinion, that, machiavelli, was, a, teacher, of, evil, even, though, machiavelli, has, become, most, famous, for, his, work, on, principalities, scholars, also, give, attention, to, the, exhortations, in, his, other, works, of, political, philosophy, while, less, well, known, than, the, prince, the, discourses, on, livy, composed, c, 1517, has, been, said, to, have, paved, the, way, for, modern, republicanism, his, works, were, a, major, influence, on, enlightenment, authors, who, revived, interest, in, classical, republicanism, such, as, jean, jacques, rousseau, and, james, harrington, machiavelli, s, political, realism, has, continued, to, influence, generations, of, academics, and, politicians, including, hannah, arendt, and, his, approach, has, been, compared, to, the, realpolitik, of, otto, von, bismarck, machiavelli, was, born, in, florence, italy, the, third, child, and, first, son, of, attorney, bernardo, di, niccol, machiavelli, and, his, wife, bartolomea, di, stefano, nelli, on, 3, may, 1469, the, machiavelli, family, is, believed, to, be, descended, from, the, old, marquesses, of, tuscany, and, to, have, produced, thirteen, florentine, gonfalonieres, of, justice, one, of, the, offices, of, a, group, of, nine, citizens, selected, by, drawing, lots, every, two, months, and, who, formed, the, government, or, signoria, he, was, never, though, a, full, citizen, of, florence, because, of, the, nature, of, florentine, citizenship, in, that, time, even, under, the, republican, regime, machiavelli, married, marietta, corsini, in, 1501, they, had, seven, children, five, sons, and, two, daughters, primerana, bernardo, lodovico, guido, piero, baccina, and, totto, machiavelli, was, born, in, a, tumultuous, era, the, italian, city, states, and, the, families, and, individuals, who, ran, them, could, rise, and, fall, suddenly, as, popes, and, the, kings, of, france, spain, and, the, holy, roman, empire, waged, acquisitive, wars, for, regional, influence, and, control, political, military, alliances, continually, changed, featuring, condottieri, mercenary, leaders, who, changed, sides, without, warning, and, the, rise, and, fall, of, many, short, lived, governments, machiavelli, was, taught, grammar, rhetoric, and, latin, by, his, teacher, paolo, da, ronciglione, it, is, unknown, whether, machiavelli, knew, greek, florence, was, at, the, time, one, of, the, centres, of, greek, scholarship, in, europe, in, 1494, florence, restored, the, republic, expelling, the, medici, family, that, had, ruled, florence, for, some, sixty, years, shortly, after, the, execution, of, savonarola, machiavelli, was, appointed, to, an, office, of, the, second, chancery, a, medieval, writing, office, that, put, machiavelli, in, charge, of, the, production, of, official, florentine, government, documents, shortly, thereafter, he, was, also, made, the, secretary, of, the, dieci, di, libert, e, pace, in, the, first, decade, of, the, sixteenth, century, he, carried, out, several, diplomatic, missions, most, notably, to, the, papacy, in, rome, florence, sent, him, to, pistoia, to, pacify, the, leaders, of, two, opposing, factions, which, had, broken, into, riots, in, 1501, and, 1502, when, this, failed, the, leaders, were, banished, from, the, city, a, strategy, which, machiavelli, had, favoured, from, the, outset, from, 1502, to, 1503, he, witnessed, the, brutal, reality, of, the, state, building, methods, of, cesare, borgia, 1475, 1507, and, his, father, pope, alexander, vi, who, were, then, engaged, in, the, process, of, trying, to, bring, a, large, part, of, central, italy, under, their, possession, the, pretext, of, defending, church, interests, was, used, as, a, partial, justification, by, the, borgias, other, excursions, to, the, court, of, louis, xii, and, the, spanish, court, influenced, his, writings, such, as, the, prince, at, the, start, of, the, 16th, century, machiavelli, conceived, of, a, militia, for, florence, and, he, then, began, recruiting, and, creating, it, he, distrusted, mercenaries, a, distrust, that, he, explained, in, his, official, reports, and, then, later, in, his, theoretical, works, for, their, unpatriotic, and, uninvested, nature, in, the, war, that, makes, their, allegiance, fickle, and, often, unreliable, when, most, needed, and, instead, staffed, his, army, with, citizens, a, policy, that, yielded, some, positive, results, by, february, 1506, he, was, able, to, have, four, hundred, farmers, marching, on, parade, suited, including, iron, breastplates, and, armed, with, lances, and, small, firearms, under, his, command, florentine, citizen, soldiers, conquered, pisa, in, 1509, machiavelli, s, success, was, short, lived, in, august, 1512, the, medici, backed, by, pope, julius, ii, used, spanish, troops, to, defeat, the, florentines, at, prato, in, the, wake, of, the, siege, piero, soderini, resigned, as, florentine, head, of, state, and, fled, into, exile, the, experience, would, like, machiavelli, s, time, in, foreign, courts, and, with, the, borgia, heavily, influence, his, political, writings, the, florentine, city, state, and, the, republic, were, dissolved, with, machiavelli, then, being, removed, from, office, and, banished, from, the, city, for, a, year, in, 1513, the, medici, accused, him, of, conspiracy, against, them, and, had, him, imprisoned, despite, being, subjected, to, torture, with, the, rope, in, which, the, prisoner, is, hanged, from, his, bound, wrists, from, the, back, forcing, the, arms, to, bear, the, body, s, weight, and, dislocating, the, shoulders, he, denied, involvement, and, was, released, after, three, weeks, machiavelli, then, retired, to, his, farm, estate, at, sant, andrea, in, percussina, near, san, casciano, in, val, di, pesa, where, he, devoted, himself, to, studying, and, writing, political, treatises, during, this, period, he, represented, the, florentine, republic, on, diplomatic, visits, to, france, germany, and, elsewhere, in, italy, despairing, of, the, opportunity, to, remain, directly, involved, in, political, matters, after, a, time, he, began, to, participate, in, intellectual, groups, in, florence, and, wrote, several, plays, that, unlike, his, works, on, political, theory, were, both, popular, and, widely, known, in, his, lifetime, politics, remained, his, main, passion, and, to, satisfy, this, interest, he, maintained, a, well, known, correspondence, with, more, politically, connected, friends, attempting, to, become, involved, once, again, in, political, life, in, a, letter, to, francesco, vettori, he, described, his, experience, when, evening, comes, i, go, back, home, and, go, to, my, study, on, the, threshold, i, take, off, my, work, clothes, covered, in, mud, and, filth, and, i, put, on, the, clothes, an, ambassador, would, wear, decently, dressed, i, enter, the, ancient, courts, of, rulers, who, have, long, since, died, there, i, am, warmly, welcomed, and, i, feed, on, the, only, food, i, find, nourishing, and, was, born, to, savour, i, am, not, ashamed, to, talk, to, them, and, ask, them, to, explain, their, actions, and, they, out, of, kindness, answer, me, four, hours, go, by, without, my, feeling, any, anxiety, i, forget, every, worry, i, am, no, longer, afraid, of, poverty, or, frightened, of, death, i, live, entirely, through, them, machiavelli, died, on, 21, june, 1527, from, a, stomach, ailment, at, the, age, of, 58, after, receiving, his, last, rites, he, was, buried, at, the, church, of, santa, croce, in, florence, in, 1789, george, nassau, clavering, and, pietro, leopoldo, grand, duke, of, tuscany, initiated, the, construction, of, a, monument, on, machiavelli, s, tomb, it, was, sculpted, by, innocenzo, spinazzi, with, an, epitaph, by, doctor, ferroni, inscribed, on, it, machiavelli, s, best, known, book, il, principe, contains, several, maxims, concerning, politics, instead, of, the, more, traditional, target, audience, of, a, hereditary, prince, it, concentrates, on, the, possibility, of, a, new, prince, to, retain, power, the, hereditary, prince, must, carefully, balance, the, interests, of, a, variety, of, institutions, to, which, the, people, are, accustomed, by, contrast, a, new, prince, has, the, more, difficult, task, in, ruling, he, must, first, stabilise, his, newfound, power, in, order, to, build, an, enduring, political, structure, machiavelli, suggests, that, the, social, benefits, of, stability, and, security, can, be, achieved, in, the, face, of, moral, corruption, machiavelli, believed, that, public, and, private, morality, had, to, be, understood, as, two, different, things, in, order, to, rule, well, as, a, result, a, ruler, must, be, concerned, not, only, with, reputation, but, also, must, be, positively, willing, to, act, unscrupulously, at, the, right, times, machiavelli, believed, that, for, a, ruler, it, was, better, to, be, widely, feared, than, to, be, greatly, loved, a, loved, ruler, retains, authority, by, obligation, while, a, feared, leader, rules, by, fear, of, punishment, as, a, political, theorist, machiavelli, emphasized, the, necessity, for, the, methodical, exercise, of, brute, force, or, deceit, including, extermination, of, entire, noble, families, to, head, off, any, chance, of, a, challenge, to, the, prince, s, authority, scholars, often, note, that, machiavelli, glorifies, instrumentality, in, state, building, an, approach, embodied, by, the, saying, often, attributed, to, interpretations, of, the, prince, the, ends, justify, the, means, fraud, and, deceit, are, held, by, machiavelli, as, necessary, for, a, prince, to, use, violence, may, be, necessary, for, the, successful, stabilization, of, power, and, introduction, of, new, political, institutions, force, may, be, used, to, eliminate, political, rivals, destroy, resistant, populations, and, purge, the, community, of, other, men, strong, enough, of, a, character, to, rule, who, will, inevitably, attempt, to, replace, the, ruler, machiavelli, has, become, infamous, for, such, political, advice, ensuring, that, he, would, be, remembered, in, history, through, the, adjective, machiavellian, due, to, the, treatise, s, controversial, analysis, on, politics, the, catholic, church, banned, the, prince, putting, it, on, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, humanists, also, viewed, the, book, negatively, including, erasmus, of, rotterdam, as, a, treatise, its, primary, intellectual, contribution, to, the, history, of, political, thought, is, the, fundamental, break, between, political, realism, and, political, idealism, due, to, it, being, a, manual, on, acquiring, and, keeping, political, power, in, contrast, with, plato, and, aristotle, machiavelli, insisted, that, an, imaginary, ideal, society, is, not, a, model, by, which, a, prince, should, orient, himself, concerning, the, differences, and, similarities, in, machiavelli, s, advice, to, ruthless, and, tyrannical, princes, in, the, prince, and, his, more, republican, exhortations, in, discourses, on, livy, a, few, commentators, assert, that, the, prince, although, written, as, advice, for, a, monarchical, prince, contains, arguments, for, the, superiority, of, republican, regimes, similar, to, those, found, in, the, discourses, in, the, 18th, century, the, work, was, even, called, a, satire, for, example, by, jean, jacques, rousseau, scholars, such, as, leo, strauss, and, harvey, mansfield, have, stated, that, sections, of, the, prince, and, his, other, works, have, deliberately, esoteric, statements, throughout, them, however, mansfield, states, that, this, is, the, result, of, machiavelli, s, seeing, grave, and, serious, things, as, humorous, because, they, are, manipulable, by, men, and, sees, them, as, grave, because, they, answer, human, necessities, another, interpretation, is, that, of, antonio, gramsci, who, argued, that, machiavelli, s, audience, for, this, work, was, not, even, the, ruling, class, but, the, common, people, because, rulers, already, knew, these, methods, through, their, education, the, discourses, on, the, first, ten, books, of, titus, livius, written, around, 1517, and, published, in, 1531, often, referred, to, simply, as, the, discourses, or, discorsi, is, nominally, a, discussion, regarding, the, classical, history, of, early, ancient, rome, although, it, strays, far, from, this, subject, matter, and, also, uses, contemporary, political, examples, to, illustrate, points, machiavelli, presents, it, as, a, series, of, lessons, on, how, a, republic, should, be, started, and, structured, it, is, a, larger, work, than, the, prince, and, while, it, more, openly, explains, the, advantages, of, republics, it, also, contains, many, similar, themes, from, his, other, works, for, example, machiavelli, has, noted, that, to, save, a, republic, from, corruption, it, is, necessary, to, return, it, to, a, kingly, state, using, violent, means, he, excuses, romulus, for, murdering, his, brother, remus, and, co, ruler, titus, tatius, to, gain, absolute, power, for, himself, in, that, he, established, a, civil, way, of, life, commentators, disagree, about, how, much, the, two, works, agree, with, each, other, as, machiavelli, frequently, refers, to, leaders, of, republics, as, princes, machiavelli, even, sometimes, acts, as, an, advisor, to, tyrants, other, scholars, have, pointed, out, the, aggrandizing, and, imperialistic, features, of, machiavelli, s, republic, nevertheless, it, became, one, of, the, central, texts, of, modern, republicanism, and, has, often, been, argued, to, be, a, more, comprehensive, work, than, the, prince, major, commentary, on, machiavelli, s, work, has, focused, on, two, issues, how, unified, and, philosophical, his, work, is, and, how, innovative, or, traditional, it, is, there, is, some, disagreement, concerning, how, best, to, describe, the, unifying, themes, if, there, are, any, that, can, be, found, in, machiavelli, s, works, especially, in, the, two, major, political, works, the, prince, and, discourses, some, commentators, have, described, him, as, inconsistent, and, perhaps, as, not, even, putting, a, high, priority, on, consistency, others, such, as, hans, baron, have, argued, that, his, ideas, must, have, changed, dramatically, over, time, some, have, argued, that, his, conclusions, are, best, understood, as, a, product, of, his, times, experiences, and, education, others, such, as, leo, strauss, and, harvey, mansfield, have, argued, strongly, that, there, is, a, strong, and, deliberate, consistency, and, distinctness, even, arguing, that, this, extends, to, all, of, machiavelli, s, works, including, his, comedies, and, letters, commentators, such, as, leo, strauss, have, gone, so, far, as, to, name, machiavelli, as, the, deliberate, originator, of, modernity, itself, others, have, argued, that, machiavelli, is, only, a, particularly, interesting, example, of, trends, which, were, happening, around, him, in, any, case, machiavelli, presented, himself, at, various, times, as, someone, reminding, italians, of, the, old, virtues, of, the, romans, and, greeks, and, other, times, as, someone, promoting, a, completely, new, approach, to, politics, that, machiavelli, had, a, wide, range, of, influences, is, in, itself, not, controversial, their, relative, importance, is, however, a, subject, of, ongoing, discussion, it, is, possible, to, summarize, some, of, the, main, influences, emphasized, by, different, commentators, the, mirror, of, princes, genre, gilbert, 1938, summarized, the, similarities, between, the, prince, and, the, genre, it, obviously, imitates, the, so, called, mirror, of, princes, style, this, was, a, classically, influenced, genre, with, models, at, least, as, far, back, as, xenophon, and, isocrates, while, gilbert, emphasized, the, similarities, however, he, agreed, with, all, other, commentators, that, machiavelli, was, particularly, novel, in, the, way, he, used, this, genre, even, when, compared, to, his, contemporaries, such, as, baldassare, castiglione, and, erasmus, one, of, the, major, innovations, gilbert, noted, was, that, machiavelli, focused, on, the, deliberate, purpose, of, dealing, with, a, new, ruler, who, will, need, to, establish, himself, in, defiance, of, custom, normally, these, types, of, works, were, addressed, only, to, hereditary, princes, xenophon, is, also, an, exception, in, this, regard, classical, republicanism, commentators, such, as, quentin, skinner, and, j, g, a, pocock, in, the, so, called, cambridge, school, of, interpretation, have, asserted, that, some, of, the, republican, themes, in, machiavelli, s, political, works, particularly, the, discourses, on, livy, can, be, found, in, medieval, italian, literature, which, was, influenced, by, classical, authors, such, as, sallust, classical, political, philosophy, xenophon, plato, and, aristotle, the, socratic, school, of, classical, political, philosophy, especially, aristotle, had, become, a, major, influence, upon, european, political, thinking, in, the, late, middle, ages, it, existed, both, in, the, catholicised, form, presented, by, thomas, aquinas, and, in, the, more, controversial, averroist, form, of, authors, like, marsilius, of, padua, machiavelli, was, critical, of, catholic, political, thinking, and, may, have, been, influenced, by, averroism, but, he, rarely, cites, plato, and, aristotle, and, most, likely, did, not, approve, of, them, leo, strauss, argued, that, the, strong, influence, of, xenophon, a, student, of, socrates, more, known, as, a, historian, rhetorician, and, soldier, was, a, major, source, of, socratic, ideas, for, machiavelli, sometimes, not, in, line, with, aristotle, while, interest, in, plato, was, increasing, in, florence, during, machiavelli, s, lifetime, machiavelli, does, not, show, particular, interest, in, him, but, was, indirectly, influenced, by, his, readings, of, authors, such, as, polybius, plutarch, and, cicero, the, major, difference, between, machiavelli, and, the, socratics, according, to, strauss, is, machiavelli, s, materialism, and, therefore, his, rejection, of, both, a, teleological, view, of, nature, and, of, the, view, that, philosophy, is, higher, than, politics, with, their, teleological, understanding, of, things, socratics, argued, that, by, nature, everything, that, acts, acts, towards, some, end, as, if, nature, desired, them, but, machiavelli, claimed, that, such, things, happen, by, blind, chance, or, human, action, classical, materialism, strauss, argued, that, machiavelli, may, have, seen, himself, as, influenced, by, some, ideas, from, classical, materialists, such, as, democritus, epicurus, and, lucretius, strauss, however, sees, this, also, as, a, sign, of, major, innovation, in, machiavelli, because, classical, materialists, did, not, share, the, socratic, regard, for, political, life, while, machiavelli, clearly, did, thucydides, some, scholars, note, the, similarity, between, machiavelli, and, the, greek, historian, thucydides, since, both, emphasized, power, politics, strauss, argued, that, machiavelli, may, indeed, have, been, influenced, by, pre, socratic, philosophers, but, he, felt, it, was, a, new, combination, contemporary, readers, are, reminded, by, machiavelli, s, teaching, of, thucydides, they, find, in, both, authors, the, same, realism, i, e, the, same, denial, of, the, power, of, the, gods, or, of, justice, and, the, same, sensitivity, to, harsh, necessity, and, elusive, chance, yet, thucydides, never, calls, in, question, the, intrinsic, superiority, of, nobility, to, baseness, a, superiority, that, shines, forth, particularly, when, the, noble, is, destroyed, by, the, base, therefore, thucydides, history, arouses, in, the, reader, a, sadness, which, is, never, aroused, by, machiavelli, s, books, in, machiavelli, we, find, comedies, parodies, and, satires, but, nothing, reminding, of, tragedy, one, half, of, humanity, remains, outside, of, his, thought, there, is, no, tragedy, in, machiavelli, because, he, has, no, sense, of, the, sacredness, of, the, common, strauss, 1958, p, 292, amongst, commentators, there, are, a, few, consistently, made, proposals, concerning, what, was, most, new, in, machiavelli, s, work, machiavelli, is, sometimes, seen, as, the, prototype, of, a, modern, empirical, scientist, building, generalizations, from, experience, and, historical, facts, and, emphasizing, the, uselessness, of, theorizing, with, the, imagination, he, emancipated, politics, from, theology, and, moral, philosophy, he, undertook, to, describe, simply, what, rulers, actually, did, and, thus, anticipated, what, was, later, called, the, scientific, spirit, in, which, questions, of, good, and, bad, are, ignored, and, the, observer, attempts, to, discover, only, what, really, happens, machiavelli, felt, that, his, early, schooling, along, the, lines, of, traditional, classical, education, was, essentially, useless, for, the, purpose, of, understanding, politics, nevertheless, he, advocated, intensive, study, of, the, past, particularly, regarding, the, founding, of, a, city, which, he, felt, was, a, key, to, understanding, its, later, development, moreover, he, studied, the, way, people, lived, and, aimed, to, inform, leaders, how, they, should, rule, and, even, how, they, themselves, should, live, machiavelli, denies, the, classical, opinion, that, living, virtuously, always, leads, to, happiness, for, example, machiavelli, viewed, misery, as, one, of, the, vices, that, enables, a, prince, to, rule, machiavelli, stated, that, it, would, be, best, to, be, both, loved, and, feared, but, since, the, two, rarely, come, together, anyone, compelled, to, choose, will, find, greater, security, in, being, feared, than, in, being, loved, in, much, of, machiavelli, s, work, he, often, states, that, the, ruler, must, adopt, unsavoury, policies, for, the, sake, of, the, continuance, of, his, regime, a, related, and, more, controversial, proposal, often, made, is, that, he, described, how, to, do, things, in, politics, in, a, way, which, seemed, neutral, concerning, who, used, the, advice, tyrants, or, good, rulers, that, machiavelli, strove, for, realism, is, not, doubted, but, for, four, centuries, scholars, have, debated, how, best, to, describe, his, morality, the, prince, made, the, word, machiavellian, a, byword, for, deceit, despotism, and, political, manipulation, leo, strauss, declared, himself, inclined, toward, the, traditional, view, that, machiavelli, was, self, consciously, a, teacher, of, evil, since, he, counsels, the, princes, to, avoid, the, values, of, justice, mercy, temperance, wisdom, and, love, of, their, people, in, preference, to, the, use, of, cruelty, violence, fear, and, deception, strauss, takes, up, this, opinion, because, he, asserted, that, failure, to, accept, the, traditional, opinion, misses, the, intrepidity, of, his, thought, and, the, graceful, subtlety, of, his, speech, italian, anti, fascist, philosopher, benedetto, croce, 1925, concludes, machiavelli, is, simply, a, realist, or, pragmatist, who, accurately, states, that, moral, values, in, reality, do, not, greatly, affect, the, decisions, that, political, leaders, make, german, philosopher, ernst, cassirer, 1946, held, that, machiavelli, simply, adopts, the, stance, of, a, political, scientist, a, galileo, of, politics, in, distinguishing, between, the, facts, of, political, life, and, the, values, of, moral, judgment, on, the, other, hand, walter, russell, mead, has, argued, that, the, prince, s, advice, presupposes, the, importance, of, ideas, like, legitimacy, in, making, changes, to, the, political, system, machiavelli, is, generally, seen, as, being, critical, of, christianity, as, it, existed, in, his, time, specifically, its, effect, upon, politics, and, also, everyday, life, in, his, opinion, christianity, along, with, the, teleological, aristotelianism, that, the, church, had, come, to, accept, allowed, practical, decisions, to, be, guided, too, much, by, imaginary, ideals, and, encouraged, people, to, lazily, leave, events, up, to, providence, or, as, he, would, put, it, chance, luck, or, fortune, while, christianity, sees, modesty, as, a, virtue, and, pride, as, sinful, machiavelli, took, a, more, classical, position, seeing, ambition, spiritedness, and, the, pursuit, of, glory, as, good, and, natural, things, and, part, of, the, virtue, and, prudence, that, good, princes, should, have, therefore, while, it, was, traditional, to, say, that, leaders, should, have, virtues, especially, prudence, machiavelli, s, use, of, the, words, virt, and, prudenza, was, unusual, for, his, time, implying, a, spirited, and, immodest, ambition, mansfield, describes, his, usage, of, virt, as, a, compromise, with, evil, famously, machiavelli, argued, that, virtue, and, prudence, can, help, a, man, control, more, of, his, future, in, the, place, of, allowing, fortune, to, do, so, najemy, 1993, has, argued, that, this, same, approach, can, be, found, in, machiavelli, s, approach, to, love, and, desire, as, seen, in, his, comedies, and, correspondence, najemy, shows, how, machiavelli, s, friend, vettori, argued, against, machiavelli, and, cited, a, more, traditional, understanding, of, fortune, on, the, other, hand, humanism, in, machiavelli, s, time, meant, that, classical, pre, christian, ideas, about, virtue, and, prudence, including, the, possibility, of, trying, to, control, one, s, future, were, not, unique, to, him, but, humanists, did, not, go, so, far, as, to, promote, the, extra, glory, of, deliberately, aiming, to, establish, a, new, state, in, defiance, of, traditions, and, laws, while, machiavelli, s, approach, had, classical, precedents, it, has, been, argued, that, it, did, more, than, just, bring, back, old, ideas, and, that, machiavelli, was, not, a, typical, humanist, strauss, 1958, argues, that, the, way, machiavelli, combines, classical, ideas, is, new, while, xenophon, and, plato, also, described, realistic, politics, and, were, closer, to, machiavelli, than, aristotle, was, they, like, aristotle, also, saw, philosophy, as, something, higher, than, politics, machiavelli, was, apparently, a, materialist, who, objected, to, explanations, involving, formal, and, final, causation, or, teleology, machiavelli, s, promotion, of, ambition, among, leaders, while, denying, any, higher, standard, meant, that, he, encouraged, risk, taking, and, innovation, most, famously, the, founding, of, new, modes, and, orders, his, advice, to, princes, was, therefore, certainly, not, limited, to, discussing, how, to, maintain, a, state, it, has, been, argued, that, machiavelli, s, promotion, of, innovation, led, directly, to, the, argument, for, progress, as, an, aim, of, politics, and, civilization, but, while, a, belief, that, humanity, can, control, its, own, future, control, nature, and, progress, has, been, long, lasting, machiavelli, s, followers, starting, with, his, own, friend, guicciardini, have, tended, to, prefer, peaceful, progress, through, economic, development, and, not, warlike, progress, as, harvey, mansfield, 1995, p, 74, wrote, in, attempting, other, more, regular, and, scientific, modes, of, overcoming, fortune, machiavelli, s, successors, formalized, and, emasculated, his, notion, of, virtue, machiavelli, however, along, with, some, of, his, classical, predecessors, saw, ambition, and, spiritedness, and, therefore, war, as, inevitable, and, part, of, human, nature, strauss, concludes, his, 1958, book, thoughts, on, machiavelli, by, proposing, that, this, promotion, of, progress, leads, directly, to, the, advent, of, new, technologies, being, invented, in, both, good, and, bad, governments, strauss, argued, that, the, unavoidable, nature, of, such, arms, races, which, existed, before, modern, times, and, led, to, the, collapse, of, peaceful, civilizations, show, that, classical, minded, men, had, to, admit, in, other, words, that, in, an, important, respect, the, good, city, has, to, take, its, bearings, by, the, practice, of, bad, cities, or, that, the, bad, impose, their, law, on, the, good, strauss, 1958, pp, 298, 299, machiavelli, shows, repeatedly, that, he, saw, religion, as, man, made, and, that, the, value, of, religion, lies, in, its, contribution, to, social, order, and, the, rules, of, morality, must, be, dispensed, with, if, security, requires, it, in, the, prince, the, discourses, and, in, the, life, of, castruccio, castracani, he, describes, prophets, as, he, calls, them, like, moses, romulus, cyrus, the, great, and, theseus, he, treated, pagan, and, christian, patriarchs, in, the, same, way, as, the, greatest, of, new, princes, the, glorious, and, brutal, founders, of, the, most, novel, innovations, in, politics, and, men, whom, machiavelli, assures, us, have, always, used, a, large, amount, of, armed, force, and, murder, against, their, own, people, he, estimated, that, these, sects, last, from, 1, 666, to, 3, 000, years, each, time, which, as, pointed, out, by, leo, strauss, would, mean, that, christianity, became, due, to, start, finishing, about, 150, years, after, machiavelli, machiavelli, s, concern, with, christianity, as, a, sect, was, that, it, makes, men, weak, and, inactive, delivering, politics, into, the, hands, of, cruel, and, wicked, men, without, a, fight, while, fear, of, god, can, be, replaced, by, fear, of, the, prince, if, there, is, a, strong, enough, prince, machiavelli, felt, that, having, a, religion, is, in, any, case, especially, essential, to, keeping, a, republic, in, order, for, machiavelli, a, truly, great, prince, can, never, be, conventionally, religious, himself, but, he, should, make, his, people, religious, if, he, can, according, to, strauss, 1958, pp, 226, 227, he, was, not, the, first, person, to, explain, religion, in, this, way, but, his, description, of, religion, was, novel, because, of, the, way, he, integrated, this, into, his, general, account, of, princes, machiavelli, s, judgment, that, governments, need, religion, for, practical, political, reasons, was, widespread, among, modern, proponents, of, republics, until, approximately, the, time, of, the, french, revolution, this, therefore, represents, a, point, of, disagreement, between, machiavelli, and, late, modernity, despite, the, classical, precedents, which, machiavelli, was, not, the, only, one, to, promote, in, his, time, machiavelli, s, realism, and, willingness, to, argue, that, good, ends, justify, bad, things, is, seen, as, a, critical, stimulus, towards, some, of, the, most, important, theories, of, modern, politics, firstly, particularly, in, the, discourses, on, livy, machiavelli, is, unusual, in, the, positive, side, to, factionalism, in, republics, which, he, sometimes, seems, to, describe, for, example, quite, early, in, the, discourses, in, book, i, chapter, 4, a, chapter, title, announces, that, the, disunion, of, the, plebs, and, senate, in, rome, kept, rome, free, that, a, community, has, different, components, whose, interests, must, be, balanced, in, any, good, regime, is, an, idea, with, classical, precedents, but, machiavelli, s, particularly, extreme, presentation, is, seen, as, a, critical, step, towards, the, later, political, ideas, of, both, a, division, of, powers, or, checks, and, balances, ideas, which, lay, behind, the, us, constitution, as, well, as, many, other, modern, state, constitutions, similarly, the, modern, economic, argument, for, capitalism, and, most, modern, forms, of, economics, was, often, stated, in, the, form, of, public, virtue, from, private, vices, also, in, this, case, even, though, there, are, classical, precedents, machiavelli, s, insistence, on, being, both, realistic, and, ambitious, not, only, admitting, that, vice, exists, but, being, willing, to, risk, encouraging, it, is, a, critical, step, on, the, path, to, this, insight, mansfield, however, argues, that, machiavelli, s, own, aims, have, not, been, shared, by, those, he, influenced, machiavelli, argued, against, seeing, mere, peace, and, economic, growth, as, worthy, aims, on, their, own, if, they, would, lead, to, what, mansfield, calls, the, taming, of, the, prince, to, quote, robert, bireley, there, were, in, circulation, approximately, fifteen, editions, of, the, prince, and, nineteen, of, the, discourses, and, french, translations, of, each, before, they, were, placed, on, the, index, of, paul, iv, in, 1559, a, measure, which, nearly, stopped, publication, in, catholic, areas, except, in, france, three, principal, writers, took, the, field, against, machiavelli, between, the, publication, of, his, works, and, their, condemnation, in, 1559, and, again, by, the, tridentine, index, in, 1564, these, were, the, english, cardinal, reginald, pole, and, the, portuguese, bishop, jeronymo, osorio, both, of, whom, lived, for, many, years, in, italy, and, the, italian, humanist, and, later, bishop, ambrogio, caterino, politi, machiavelli, s, ideas, had, a, profound, impact, on, political, leaders, throughout, the, modern, west, helped, by, the, new, technology, of, the, printing, press, during, the, first, generations, after, machiavelli, his, main, influence, was, in, non, republican, governments, pole, reported, that, the, prince, was, spoken, of, highly, by, thomas, cromwell, in, england, and, had, influenced, henry, viii, in, his, turn, towards, protestantism, and, in, his, tactics, for, example, during, the, pilgrimage, of, grace, a, copy, was, also, possessed, by, the, catholic, king, and, emperor, charles, v, in, france, after, an, initially, mixed, reaction, machiavelli, came, to, be, associated, with, catherine, de, medici, and, the, st, bartholomew, s, day, massacre, as, bireley, 1990, 17, reports, in, the, 16th, century, catholic, writers, associated, machiavelli, with, the, protestants, whereas, protestant, authors, saw, him, as, italian, and, catholic, in, fact, he, was, apparently, influencing, both, catholic, and, protestant, kings, one, of, the, most, important, early, works, dedicated, to, criticism, of, machiavelli, especially, the, prince, was, that, of, the, huguenot, innocent, gentillet, whose, work, commonly, referred, to, as, discourse, against, machiavelli, or, anti, machiavel, was, published, in, geneva, in, 1576, he, accused, machiavelli, of, being, an, atheist, and, accused, politicians, of, his, time, by, saying, that, his, works, were, the, koran, of, the, courtiers, that, he, is, of, no, reputation, in, the, court, of, france, which, hath, not, machiavel, s, writings, at, the, fingers, ends, another, theme, of, gentillet, was, more, in, the, spirit, of, machiavelli, himself, he, questioned, the, effectiveness, of, immoral, strategies, just, as, machiavelli, had, himself, done, despite, also, explaining, how, they, could, sometimes, work, this, became, the, theme, of, much, future, political, discourse, in, europe, during, the, 17th, century, this, includes, the, catholic, counter, reformation, writers, summarised, by, bireley, giovanni, botero, justus, lipsius, carlo, scribani, adam, contzen, pedro, de, ribadeneira, and, diego, de, saavedra, fajardo, these, authors, criticized, machiavelli, but, also, followed, him, in, many, ways, they, accepted, the, need, for, a, prince, to, be, concerned, with, reputation, and, even, a, need, for, cunning, and, deceit, but, compared, to, machiavelli, and, like, later, modernist, writers, they, emphasized, economic, progress, much, more, than, the, riskier, ventures, of, war, these, authors, tended, to, cite, tacitus, as, their, source, for, realist, political, advice, rather, than, machiavelli, and, this, pretence, came, to, be, known, as, tacitism, black, tacitism, was, in, support, of, princely, rule, but, red, tacitism, arguing, the, case, for, republics, more, in, the, original, spirit, of, machiavelli, himself, became, increasingly, important, modern, materialist, philosophy, developed, in, the, 16th, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, starting, in, the, generations, after, machiavelli, modern, political, philosophy, tended, to, be, republican, but, as, with, the, catholic, authors, machiavelli, s, realism, and, encouragement, of, innovation, to, try, to, control, one, s, own, fortune, were, more, accepted, than, his, emphasis, upon, war, and, factional, violence, not, only, was, innovative, economics, and, politics, a, result, but, also, modern, science, leading, some, commentators, to, say, that, the, 18th, century, enlightenment, involved, a, humanitarian, moderating, of, machiavellianism, the, importance, of, machiavelli, s, influence, is, notable, in, many, important, figures, in, this, endeavour, for, example, bodin, francis, bacon, algernon, sidney, harrington, john, milton, spinoza, rousseau, hume, edward, gibbon, and, adam, smith, although, he, was, not, always, mentioned, by, name, as, an, inspiration, due, to, his, controversy, he, is, also, thought, to, have, been, an, influence, for, other, major, philosophers, such, as, montaigne, descartes, hobbes, locke, and, montesquieu, jean, jacques, rousseau, who, is, associated, with, very, different, political, ideas, viewed, machiavelli, s, work, as, a, satirical, piece, in, which, machiavelli, exposes, the, faults, of, a, one, man, rule, rather, than, exalting, amorality, in, the, seventeenth, century, it, was, in, england, that, machiavelli, s, ideas, were, most, substantially, developed, and, adapted, and, that, republicanism, came, once, more, to, life, and, out, of, seventeenth, century, english, republicanism, there, were, to, emerge, in, the, next, century, not, only, a, theme, of, english, political, and, historical, reflection, of, the, writings, of, the, bolingbroke, circle, and, of, gibbon, and, of, early, parliamentary, radicals, but, a, stimulus, to, the, enlightenment, in, scotland, on, the, continent, and, in, america, scholars, have, argued, that, machiavelli, was, a, major, indirect, and, direct, influence, upon, the, political, thinking, of, the, founding, fathers, of, the, united, states, due, to, his, overwhelming, favouritism, of, republicanism, and, the, republican, type, of, government, according, to, john, mccormick, it, is, still, very, much, debatable, whether, or, not, machiavelli, was, an, advisor, of, tyranny, or, partisan, of, liberty, benjamin, franklin, james, madison, and, thomas, jefferson, followed, machiavelli, s, republicanism, when, they, opposed, what, they, saw, as, the, emerging, aristocracy, that, they, feared, alexander, hamilton, was, creating, with, the, federalist, party, hamilton, learned, from, machiavelli, about, the, importance, of, foreign, policy, for, domestic, policy, but, may, have, broken, from, him, regarding, how, rapacious, a, republic, needed, to, be, in, order, to, survive, george, washington, was, less, influenced, by, machiavelli, the, founding, father, who, perhaps, most, studied, and, valued, machiavelli, as, a, political, philosopher, was, john, adams, who, profusely, commented, on, the, italian, s, thought, in, his, work, a, defence, of, the, constitutions, of, government, of, the, united, states, of, america, in, this, work, john, adams, praised, machiavelli, with, algernon, sidney, and, montesquieu, as, a, philosophic, defender, of, mixed, government, for, adams, machiavelli, restored, empirical, reason, to, politics, while, his, analysis, of, factions, was, commendable, adams, likewise, agreed, with, the, florentine, that, human, nature, was, immutable, and, driven, by, passions, he, also, accepted, machiavelli, s, belief, that, all, societies, were, subject, to, cyclical, periods, of, growth, and, decay, for, adams, machiavelli, lacked, only, a, clear, understanding, of, the, institutions, necessary, for, good, government, the, 20th, century, italian, communist, antonio, gramsci, drew, great, inspiration, from, machiavelli, s, writings, on, ethics, morals, and, how, they, relate, to, the, state, and, revolution, in, his, writings, on, passive, revolution, and, how, a, society, can, be, manipulated, by, controlling, popular, notions, of, morality, joseph, stalin, read, the, prince, and, annotated, his, own, copy, in, the, 20th, century, there, was, also, renewed, interest, in, machiavelli, s, play, la, mandragola, 1518, which, received, numerous, stagings, including, several, in, new, york, at, the, new, york, shakespeare, festival, in, 1976, and, the, riverside, shakespeare, company, in, 1979, as, a, musical, comedy, by, peer, raben, in, munich, s, anti, theatre, in, 1971, and, at, london, s, national, theatre, in, 1984, machiavelli, s, works, are, sometimes, even, said, to, have, contributed, to, the, modern, negative, connotations, of, the, words, politics, and, politician, and, it, is, sometimes, thought, that, it, is, because, of, him, that, old, nick, became, an, english, term, for, the, devil, more, obviously, the, adjective, machiavellian, became, a, term, describing, a, form, of, politics, that, is, marked, by, cunning, duplicity, or, bad, faith, machiavellianism, also, remains, a, popular, term, used, casually, in, political, discussions, often, as, a, byword, for, bare, knuckled, political, realism, while, machiavellianism, is, notable, in, the, works, of, machiavelli, scholars, generally, agree, that, his, works, are, complex, and, have, equally, influential, themes, within, them, for, example, j, g, a, pocock, 1975, saw, him, as, a, major, source, of, the, republicanism, that, spread, throughout, england, and, north, america, in, the, 17th, and, 18th, centuries, and, leo, strauss, 1958, whose, view, of, machiavelli, is, quite, different, in, many, ways, had, similar, remarks, about, machiavelli, s, influence, on, republicanism, and, argued, that, even, though, machiavelli, was, a, teacher, of, evil, he, had, a, grandeur, of, vision, that, led, him, to, advocate, immoral, actions, whatever, his, intentions, which, are, still, debated, today, he, has, become, associated, with, any, proposal, where, the, end, justifies, the, means, for, example, leo, strauss, 1987, p, 297, wrote, machiavelli, is, the, only, political, thinker, whose, name, has, come, into, common, use, for, designating, a, kind, of, politics, which, exists, and, will, continue, to, exist, independently, of, his, influence, a, politics, guided, exclusively, by, considerations, of, expediency, which, uses, all, means, fair, or, foul, iron, or, poison, for, achieving, its, ends, its, end, being, the, aggrandizement, of, one, s, country, or, fatherland, but, also, using, the, fatherland, in, the, service, of, the, self, aggrandizement, of, the, politician, or, statesman, or, one, s, party, in, english, renaissance, theatre, elizabethan, and, jacobian, the, term, machiavel, from, nicholas, machiavel, an, anglicization, of, machiavelli, s, name, based, on, french, was, used, for, a, stock, antagonist, that, resorted, to, ruthless, means, to, preserve, the, power, of, the, state, and, is, now, considered, a, synonym, of, machiavellian, christopher, marlowe, s, play, the, jew, of, malta, ca, 1589, contains, a, prologue, by, a, character,
