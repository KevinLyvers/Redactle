louis, jacques, mand, daguerre, d, r, d, gair, french, 18, november, 1787, 10, july, 1851, was, a, french, artist, and, photographer, recognized, for, his, invention, of, the, eponymous, daguerreotype, process, of, photography, he, became, known, as, one, of, the, fathers, of, photography, though, he, is, most, famous, for, his, contributions, to, photography, he, was, also, an, accomplished, painter, scenic, designer, and, a, developer, of, the, diorama, theatre, louis, daguerre, was, born, in, cormeilles, en, parisis, val, d, oise, he, was, apprenticed, in, architecture, theatre, design, and, panoramic, painting, to, pierre, pr, vost, the, first, french, panorama, painter, exceedingly, adept, at, his, skill, of, theatrical, illusion, he, became, a, celebrated, designer, for, the, theatre, and, later, came, to, invent, the, diorama, which, opened, in, paris, in, july, 1822, in, 1829, daguerre, partnered, with, nic, phore, ni, pce, an, inventor, who, had, produced, the, world, s, first, heliograph, in, 1822, and, the, oldest, surviving, camera, photograph, in, 1826, or, 1827, ni, pce, died, suddenly, in, 1833, but, daguerre, continued, experimenting, and, evolved, the, process, which, would, subsequently, be, known, as, the, daguerreotype, after, efforts, to, interest, private, investors, proved, fruitless, daguerre, went, public, with, his, invention, in, 1839, at, a, joint, meeting, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, and, the, acad, mie, des, beaux, arts, on, 7, january, of, that, year, the, invention, was, announced, and, described, in, general, terms, but, all, specific, details, were, withheld, under, assurances, of, strict, confidentiality, daguerre, explained, and, demonstrated, the, process, only, to, the, academy, s, perpetual, secretary, fran, ois, arago, who, proved, to, be, an, invaluable, advocate, members, of, the, academy, and, other, select, individuals, were, allowed, to, examine, specimens, at, daguerre, s, studio, the, images, were, enthusiastically, praised, as, nearly, miraculous, and, news, of, the, daguerreotype, quickly, spread, arrangements, were, made, for, daguerre, s, rights, to, be, acquired, by, the, french, government, in, exchange, for, lifetime, pensions, for, himself, and, ni, pce, s, son, isidore, then, on, 19, august, 1839, the, french, government, presented, the, invention, as, a, gift, from, france, free, to, the, world, and, complete, working, instructions, were, published, in, 1839, he, was, elected, to, the, national, academy, of, design, as, an, honorary, academician, daguerre, died, from, a, heart, attack, on, 10, july, 1851, in, bry, sur, marne, 12, km, 7, mi, from, paris, a, monument, marks, his, grave, there, daguerre, s, name, is, one, of, the, 72, names, inscribed, on, the, eiffel, tower, in, the, mid, 1820s, prior, to, his, association, with, daguerre, ni, pce, used, a, coating, of, bitumen, of, judea, to, make, the, first, permanent, camera, photographs, the, bitumen, was, hardened, where, it, was, exposed, to, light, and, the, unhardened, portion, was, then, removed, with, a, solvent, a, camera, exposure, lasting, for, hours, or, days, was, required, ni, pce, and, daguerre, later, refined, this, process, but, unacceptably, long, exposures, were, still, needed, after, the, death, of, ni, pce, in, 1833, daguerre, concentrated, his, attention, on, the, light, sensitive, properties, of, silver, salts, which, had, previously, been, demonstrated, by, johann, heinrich, schultz, and, others, for, the, process, which, was, eventually, named, the, daguerreotype, he, exposed, a, thin, silver, plated, copper, sheet, to, the, vapour, given, off, by, iodine, crystals, producing, a, coating, of, light, sensitive, silver, iodide, on, the, surface, the, plate, was, then, exposed, in, the, camera, initially, this, process, too, required, a, very, long, exposure, to, produce, a, distinct, image, but, daguerre, made, the, crucial, discovery, that, an, invisibly, faint, latent, image, created, by, a, much, shorter, exposure, could, be, chemically, developed, into, a, visible, image, upon, seeing, the, image, the, contents, of, which, are, unknown, daguerre, said, i, have, seized, the, light, i, have, arrested, its, flight, the, latent, image, on, a, daguerreotype, plate, was, developed, by, subjecting, it, to, the, vapour, given, off, by, mercury, heated, to, 75, c, the, resulting, visible, image, was, then, fixed, made, insensitive, to, further, exposure, to, light, by, removing, the, unaffected, silver, iodide, with, concentrated, and, heated, salt, water, later, a, solution, of, the, more, effective, hypo, hyposulphite, of, soda, now, known, as, sodium, thiosulfate, was, used, instead, the, resultant, plate, produced, an, exact, reproduction, of, the, scene, the, image, was, laterally, reversed, as, images, in, mirrors, are, unless, a, mirror, or, inverting, prism, was, used, during, exposure, to, flip, the, image, to, be, seen, optimally, the, image, had, to, be, lit, at, a, certain, angle, and, viewed, so, that, the, smooth, parts, of, its, mirror, like, surface, which, represented, the, darkest, parts, of, the, image, reflected, something, dark, or, dimly, lit, the, surface, was, subject, to, tarnishing, by, prolonged, exposure, to, the, air, and, was, so, soft, that, it, could, be, marred, by, the, slightest, friction, so, a, daguerreotype, was, almost, always, sealed, under, glass, before, being, framed, as, was, commonly, done, in, france, or, mounted, in, a, small, folding, case, as, was, normal, in, the, uk, and, us, daguerreotypes, were, usually, portraits, the, rarer, landscape, views, and, other, unusual, subjects, are, now, much, sought, after, by, collectors, and, sell, for, much, higher, prices, than, ordinary, portraits, at, the, time, of, its, introduction, the, process, required, exposures, lasting, ten, minutes, or, more, for, brightly, sunlit, subjects, so, portraiture, was, an, impractical, ordeal, samuel, morse, was, astonished, to, learn, that, daguerreotypes, of, the, streets, of, paris, did, not, show, any, people, horses, or, vehicles, until, he, realized, that, due, to, the, long, exposure, times, all, moving, objects, became, invisible, within, a, few, years, exposures, had, been, reduced, to, as, little, as, a, few, seconds, by, the, use, of, additional, sensitizing, chemicals, and, faster, lenses, such, as, petzval, s, portrait, lens, the, first, mathematically, calculated, lens, the, daguerreotype, was, the, polaroid, film, of, its, day, it, produced, a, unique, image, which, could, only, be, duplicated, by, using, a, camera, to, photograph, the, original, despite, this, drawback, millions, of, daguerreotypes, were, produced, the, paper, based, calotype, process, introduced, by, henry, fox, talbot, in, 1841, allowed, the, production, of, an, unlimited, number, of, copies, by, simple, contact, printing, but, it, had, its, own, shortcomings, the, grain, of, the, paper, was, obtrusively, visible, in, the, image, and, the, extremely, fine, detail, of, which, the, daguerreotype, was, capable, was, not, possible, the, introduction, of, the, wet, collodion, process, in, the, early, 1850s, provided, the, basis, for, a, negative, positive, print, making, process, not, subject, to, these, limitations, although, it, like, the, daguerreotype, was, initially, used, to, produce, one, of, a, kind, images, ambrotypes, on, glass, and, tintypes, on, black, lacquered, iron, sheets, rather, than, prints, on, paper, these, new, types, of, images, were, much, less, expensive, than, daguerreotypes, and, they, were, easier, to, view, by, 1860, few, photographers, were, still, using, daguerre, s, process, the, same, small, ornate, cases, commonly, used, to, house, daguerreotypes, were, also, used, for, images, produced, by, the, later, and, very, different, ambrotype, and, tintype, processes, and, the, images, originally, in, them, were, sometimes, later, discarded, so, that, they, could, be, used, to, display, photographic, paper, prints, it, is, now, a, very, common, error, for, any, image, in, such, a, case, to, be, described, as, a, daguerreotype, a, true, daguerreotype, is, always, an, image, on, a, highly, polished, silver, surface, usually, under, protective, glass, if, it, is, viewed, while, a, brightly, lit, sheet, of, white, paper, is, held, so, as, to, be, seen, reflected, in, its, mirror, like, metal, surface, the, daguerreotype, image, will, appear, as, a, relatively, faint, negative, its, dark, and, light, areas, reversed, instead, of, a, normal, positive, other, types, of, photographic, images, are, almost, never, on, polished, metal, and, do, not, exhibit, this, peculiar, characteristic, of, appearing, positive, or, negative, depending, on, the, lighting, and, reflections, unbeknownst, to, either, inventor, daguerre, s, developmental, work, in, the, mid, 1830s, coincided, with, photographic, experiments, being, conducted, by, william, henry, fox, talbot, in, england, talbot, had, succeeded, in, producing, a, sensitive, paper, impregnated, with, silver, chloride, and, capturing, small, camera, images, on, it, in, the, summer, of, 1835, though, he, did, not, publicly, reveal, this, until, january, 1839, talbot, was, unaware, that, daguerre, s, late, partner, ni, pce, had, obtained, similar, small, camera, images, on, silver, chloride, coated, paper, nearly, twenty, years, earlier, ni, pce, could, find, no, way, to, keep, them, from, darkening, all, over, when, exposed, to, light, for, viewing, and, had, therefore, turned, away, from, silver, salts, to, experiment, with, other, substances, such, as, bitumen, talbot, chemically, stabilized, his, images, to, withstand, subsequent, inspection, in, daylight, by, treating, them, with, a, strong, solution, of, common, salt, when, the, first, reports, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, announcement, of, daguerre, s, invention, reached, talbot, with, no, details, about, the, exact, nature, of, the, images, or, the, process, itself, he, assumed, that, methods, similar, to, his, own, must, have, been, used, and, promptly, wrote, an, open, letter, to, the, academy, claiming, priority, of, invention, although, it, soon, became, apparent, that, daguerre, s, process, was, very, unlike, his, own, talbot, had, been, stimulated, to, resume, his, long, discontinued, photographic, experiments, the, developed, out, daguerreotype, process, only, required, an, exposure, sufficient, to, create, a, very, faint, or, completely, invisible, latent, image, which, was, then, chemically, developed, to, full, visibility, talbot, s, earlier, sensitive, paper, now, known, as, salted, paper, process, was, a, printed, out, process, that, required, prolonged, exposure, in, the, camera, until, the, image, was, fully, formed, but, his, later, calotype, also, known, as, talbotype, paper, negative, process, introduced, in, 1841, also, used, latent, image, development, greatly, reducing, the, exposure, needed, and, making, it, competitive, with, the, daguerreotype, daguerre, s, agent, miles, berry, applied, for, a, british, patent, under, the, instruction, of, daguerre, just, days, before, france, declared, the, invention, free, to, the, world, the, united, kingdom, was, thereby, uniquely, denied, france, s, free, gift, and, became, the, only, country, where, the, payment, of, license, fees, was, required, this, had, the, effect, of, inhibiting, the, spread, of, the, process, there, to, the, eventual, advantage, of, competing, processes, which, were, subsequently, introduced, into, england, antoine, claudet, was, one, of, the, few, people, legally, licensed, to, make, daguerreotypes, in, britain, in, the, spring, of, 1821, daguerre, partnered, with, charles, marie, bouton, with, the, common, goal, of, creating, a, diorama, theatre, daguerre, had, expertise, in, lighting, and, scenic, effects, and, bouton, was, the, more, experienced, painter, however, bouton, eventually, withdrew, and, daguerre, acquired, sole, responsibility, of, the, diorama, theatre, the, first, diorama, theatre, was, built, in, the, place, du, ch, teau, d, eau, now, the, place, de, la, r, publique, in, paris, the, first, exhibit, opened, 1822, and, showed, scenes, of, the, black, forest, the, inauguration, of, the, temple, of, solomon, and, the, great, fire, of, edinburgh, it, showed, two, tableaux, one, by, daguerre, and, one, by, bouton, this, would, become, a, pattern, each, exhibition, would, typically, have, two, tableaux, one, each, by, daguerre, and, bouton, also, one, would, be, an, interior, depiction, and, the, other, would, be, a, landscape, daguerre, hoped, to, create, a, realistic, illusion, for, an, audience, and, wanted, audiences, to, be, not, only, entertained, but, awe, stricken, the, diorama, theatres, were, magnificent, in, size, a, large, translucent, canvas, measuring, around, 70, ft, wide, and, 45, ft, tall, was, painted, on, both, sides, these, paintings, were, vivid, and, detailed, pictures, and, were, lit, from, different, angles, as, the, lights, changed, the, scene, would, transform, the, audience, would, begin, to, see, the, painting, on, the, other, side, of, the, screen, the, effect, was, awe, inspiring, transforming, impressions, mood, changes, and, movements, were, produced, by, a, system, of, shutters, and, screens, that, allowed, light, to, be, projected, from, behind, on, alternately, separate, sections, of, an, image, painted, on, a, semi, transparent, backdrop, because, of, their, size, the, screens, had, to, remain, stationary, since, the, tableaux, were, stationary, the, auditorium, revolved, from, one, scene, to, another, the, auditorium, was, a, cylindrical, room, and, had, a, single, opening, in, the, wall, similar, to, a, proscenium, arch, through, which, the, audience, could, watch, a, scene, audiences, would, average, around, 350, and, most, would, stand, though, limited, seating, was, provided, twenty, one, diorama, paintings, were, exhibited, in, the, first, eight, years, these, included, trinity, chapel, in, canterbury, cathedral, chartres, cathedral, city, of, rouen, and, environs, of, paris, by, bouton, valley, of, sarnen, harbour, of, brest, holyroodhouse, chapel, and, roslin, chapel, by, daguerre, the, roslin, chapel, was, known, for, a, few, legends, involving, an, unconsuming, fire, the, legend, goes, that, the, chapel, has, appeared, to, be, in, flames, just, before, a, high, status, death, but, has, later, shown, no, damage, from, any, such, fire, this, chapel, was, also, known, for, being, unique, in, its, architectural, beauty, daguerre, was, aware, of, both, of, these, aspects, of, roslin, chapel, and, this, made, it, a, perfect, subject, for, his, diorama, painting, the, legends, connected, with, the, chapel, would, be, sure, to, attract, a, large, audience, interior, of, roslin, chapel, in, paris, opened, 24, september, 1824, and, closed, february, 1825, the, scene, depicted, light, coming, in, through, a, door, and, a, window, foliage, shadows, could, be, seen, at, the, window, and, the, way, the, light, s, rays, shone, through, the, leaves, was, breathtaking, and, seemed, to, go, beyond, the, power, of, painting, maggi, then, the, light, faded, on, the, scene, as, if, a, cloud, was, passing, over, the, sun, the, times, dedicated, an, article, to, the, exhibition, calling, it, perfectly, magical, the, dioramas, prospered, earning, 200, 000, francs, a, year, a, very, high, profit, for, the, 1830s, period, the, surging, demand, led, to, new, diorama, theatres, opening, in, london, and, berlin, however, in, 8, march, 1839, a, fire, broke, out, in, the, theatre, in, paris, daguerre, urged, the, firefighters, to, stop, the, blaze, on, the, fifth, floor, where, all, his, daguerreotype, specimens, notes, and, equipment, were, kept, he, was, more, interested, in, the, development, of, daguerreotypes, and, later, in, august, 1839, his, daguerreotype, specimens, were, debuted, later, in, the, 1840s, along, with, increasing, attention, to, motion, photography, and, cinema, people, lost, interest, in, dioramas, the, fire, along, with, the, waning, demand, of, dioramas, caused, a, decline, in, the, industry
