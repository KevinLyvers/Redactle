his, imaginative, literature, mostly, in, tuscan, vernacular, as, well, as, other, works, in, latin, and, is, particularly, noted, for, his, realistic, dialogue, which, differed, from, that, of, his, contemporaries, medieval, writers, who, usually, followed, formulaic, models, for, character, and, plot, the, influence, of, boccaccio, s, works, was, not, limited, to, the, italian, cultural, scene, but, extended, to, the, rest, of, europe, exerting, influence, on, authors, such, as, geoffrey, chaucer, a, key, figure, in, english, literature, and, the, later, writers, miguel, de, cervantes, lope, de, vega, and, classical, theatre, in, spain, boccaccio, is, considered, one, of, the, three, crowns, of, italian, literature, along, with, dante, alighieri, and, petrarch, he, is, remembered, for,

he, was, the, one, who, initiated, dante, s, criticism, and, philology, boccaccio, devoted, himself, to, copying, codices, of, the, divine, comedy, and, was, a, promoter, of, dante, s, work, and, figure, in, the, twentieth, century, boccaccio, was, the, subject, of, critical, philological, studies, by, vittore, branca, and, giuseppe, billanovich, and, his, decameron, was, transposed, to, the, big, screen, by, the, director, and, writer, pier, paolo, pasolini, the, details, of, boccaccio, s, birth, are, uncertain, he, was, born, in, florence, or, in, a, village, near, certaldo, where, his, family, was, from, he, was, the, son, of, florentine, merchant, boccaccino, di, chellino, and, an, unknown, woman, he, was, likely, born, out, of, wedlock, boccaccio, s, stepmother, was, called, margherita, de, mardoli, boccaccio, grew, up, in, florence, his, father, worked, for, the, compagnia, dei, bardi, and, in, the, 1320s, married, margherita, dei, mardoli, who, was, of, a, well, to, do, family, boccaccio, may, have, been, tutored, by, giovanni, mazzuoli, and, received, from, him, an, early, introduction, to, the, works, of, dante, in, 1326, his, father, was, appointed, head, of, a, bank, and, moved, with, his, family, to, naples, boccaccio, was, an, apprentice, at, the, bank, but, disliked, the, banking, profession, he, persuaded, his, father, to, let, him, study, law, at, the, studium, the, present, day, university, of, naples, where, he, studied, canon, law, for, the, next, six, years, he, also, pursued, his, interest, in, scientific, and, literary, studies, his, father, introduced, him, to, the, neapolitan, nobility, and, the, french, influenced, court, of, robert, the, wise, the, king, of, naples, in, the, 1330s, boccaccio, became, a, friend, of, fellow, florentine, niccol, acciaioli, and, benefited, from, acciaioli, s, influence, with, catherine, of, valois, courtenay, widow, of, philip, i, of, taranto, acciaioli, later, became, a, counselor, to, queen, joanna, i, of, naples, and, eventually, her, grand, seneschal, it, seems, that, boccaccio, enjoyed, law, no, more, than, banking, but, his, studies, allowed, him, the, opportunity, to, study, widely, and, make, good, contacts, with, fellow, scholars, his, early, influences, included, paolo, da, perugia, a, curator, and, author, of, a, collection, of, myths, called, the, collectiones, humanists, barbato, da, sulmona, and, giovanni, barrili, and, theologian, dionigi, di, borgo, san, sepolcro, in, naples, boccaccio, began, what, he, considered, his, true, vocation, of, poetry, works, produced, in, this, period, include, il, filostrato, and, teseida, the, sources, for, chaucer, s, troilus, and, criseyde, and, the, knight, s, tale, respectively, the, filocolo, a, prose, version, of, an, existing, french, romance, and, la, caccia, di, diana, a, poem, in, terza, rima, listing, neapolitan, women, the, period, featured, considerable, formal, innovation, including, possibly, the, introduction, of, the, sicilian, octave, where, it, influenced, petrarch, boccaccio, returned, to, florence, in, early, 1341, avoiding, the, plague, of, 1340, in, that, city, but, also, missing, the, visit, of, petrarch, to, naples, in, 1341, he, had, left, naples, due, to, tensions, between, the, angevin, king, and, florence, his, father, had, returned, to, florence, in, 1338, where, he, had, gone, bankrupt, his, mother, possibly, died, shortly, afterwards, boccaccio, continued, to, work, although, dissatisfied, with, his, return, to, florence, producing, comedia, delle, ninfe, fiorentine, in, 1341, also, known, as, ameto, a, mix, of, prose, and, poems, completing, the, fifty, canto, allegorical, poem, amorosa, visione, in, 1342, and, fiammetta, in, 1343, the, pastoral, piece, ninfale, fiesolano, probably, dates, from, this, time, also, in, 1343, boccaccio, s, father, remarried, bice, del, bostichi, the, other, children, by, his, first, marriage, had, all, died, but, he, had, another, son, named, iacopo, in, 1344, in, florence, the, overthrow, of, walter, of, brienne, brought, about, the, government, of, popolo, minuto, small, people, workers, it, diminished, the, influence, of, the, nobility, and, the, wealthier, merchant, classes, and, contributed, to, the, relative, decline, of, florence, the, city, was, hurt, further, in, 1348, by, the, black, death, later, represented, in, the, decameron, which, killed, some, three, quarters, of, the, city, s, population, from, 1347, boccaccio, spent, much, time, in, ravenna, seeking, new, patronage, and, despite, his, claims, it, is, not, certain, whether, he, was, present, in, plague, ravaged, florence, his, stepmother, died, during, the, epidemic, and, his, father, was, closely, associated, with, the, government, efforts, as, minister, of, supply, in, the, city, his, father, died, in, 1349, and, boccaccio, was, forced, into, a, more, active, role, as, head, of, the, family, boccaccio, began, work, on, the, decameron, around, 1349, it, is, probable, that, the, structures, of, many, of, the, tales, date, from, earlier, in, his, career, but, the, choice, of, a, hundred, tales, and, the, frame, story, lieta, brigata, of, three, men, and, seven, women, dates, from, this, time, the, work, was, largely, complete, by, 1352, it, was, boccaccio, s, final, effort, in, literature, and, one, of, his, last, works, in, tuscan, vernacular, the, only, other, substantial, work, was, corbaccio, dated, to, either, 1355, or, 1365, boccaccio, revised, and, rewrote, the, decameron, in, 1370, 1371, this, manuscript, has, survived, to, the, present, day, from, 1350, boccaccio, became, closely, involved, with, italian, humanism, although, less, of, a, scholar, and, also, with, the, florentine, government, his, first, official, mission, was, to, romagna, in, late, 1350, he, revisited, that, city, state, twice, and, also, was, sent, to, brandenburg, milan, and, avignon, he, also, pushed, for, the, study, of, greek, housing, barlaam, of, calabria, and, encouraging, his, tentative, translations, of, works, by, homer, euripides, and, aristotle, in, these, years, he, also, took, minor, orders, in, october, 1350, he, was, delegated, to, greet, francesco, petrarch, as, he, entered, florence, and, also, to, have, petrarch, as, a, guest, at, boccaccio, s, home, during, his, stay, the, meeting, between, the, two, was, extremely, fruitful, and, they, were, friends, from, then, on, boccaccio, calling, petrarch, his, teacher, and, magister, petrarch, at, that, time, encouraged, boccaccio, to, study, classical, greek, and, latin, literature, they, met, again, in, padua, in, 1351, boccaccio, on, an, official, mission, to, invite, petrarch, to, take, a, chair, at, the, university, in, florence, although, unsuccessful, the, discussions, between, the, two, were, instrumental, in, boccaccio, writing, the, genealogia, deorum, gentilium, the, first, edition, was, completed, in, 1360, and, this, remained, one, of, the, key, reference, works, on, classical, mythology, for, over, 400, years, it, served, as, an, extended, defence, for, the, studies, of, ancient, literature, and, thought, despite, the, pagan, beliefs, at, its, core, boccaccio, believed, that, much, could, be, learned, from, antiquity, thus, he, challenged, the, arguments, of, clerical, intellectuals, who, wanted, to, limit, access, to, classical, sources, to, prevent, any, moral, harm, to, christian, readers, the, revival, of, classical, antiquity, became, a, foundation, of, the, renaissance, and, his, defence, of, the, importance, of, ancient, literature, was, an, essential, requirement, for, its, development, the, discussions, also, formalized, boccaccio, s, poetic, ideas, certain, sources, also, see, a, conversion, of, boccaccio, by, petrarch, from, the, open, humanist, of, the, decameron, to, a, more, ascetic, style, closer, to, the, dominant, fourteenth, century, ethos, for, example, he, followed, petrarch, and, dante, in, the, unsuccessful, championing, of, an, archaic, and, deeply, allusive, form, of, latin, poetry, in, 1359, following, a, meeting, with, pope, innocent, vi, and, further, meetings, with, petrarch, it, is, probable, that, boccaccio, took, some, kind, of, religious, mantle, there, is, a, persistent, but, unsupported, tale, that, he, repudiated, his, earlier, works, as, profane, in, 1362, including, the, decameron, in, 1360, boccaccio, began, work, on, de, mulieribus, claris, on, famous, women, a, book, offering, biographies, of, 106, famous, women, that, he, completed, in, 1374, a, number, of, boccaccio, s, close, friends, and, other, acquaintances, were, executed, or, exiled, in, the, purge, following, the, failed, coup, of, 1361, although, not, directly, linked, to, the, conspiracy, in, that, year, boccaccio, left, florence, to, reside, in, certaldo, where, he, became, less, involved, in, government, affairs, he, did, not, undertake, further, missions, for, florence, until, 1365, and, travelled, to, naples, and, then, on, to, padua, and, venice, where, he, met, up, with, petrarch, in, grand, style, at, palazzo, molina, petrarch, s, residence, as, well, as, the, location, of, petrarch, s, library, boccaccio, later, returned, to, certaldo, he, met, petrarch, only, one, more, time, in, 1368, again, in, padua, upon, hearing, of, the, death, of, petrarch, 19, july, 1374, he, wrote, a, commemorative, poem, including, it, in, his, collection, of, lyric, poems, the, rime, he, returned, to, work, for, the, florentine, government, in, 1365, undertaking, a, mission, to, pope, urban, v, the, papacy, returned, to, rome, from, avignon, in, 1367, and, boccaccio, was, again, sent, to, urban, offering, congratulations, he, also, undertook, diplomatic, missions, to, venice, and, naples, of, his, later, works, the, moralistic, biographies, gathered, as, de, casibus, virorum, illustrium, 1355, 74, and, de, mulieribus, claris, 1361, 1375, were, the, most, significant, other, works, include, a, dictionary, of, geographical, allusions, in, classical, literature, de, montibus, silvis, fontibus, lacubus, fluminibus, stagnis, seu, paludibus, et, de, nominibus, maris, liber, he, gave, a, series, of, lectures, on, dante, at, the, santo, stefano, church, in, 1373, and, these, resulted, in, his, final, major, work, the, detailed, esposizioni, sopra, la, commedia, di, dante, boccaccio, and, petrarch, were, also, two, of, the, most, educated, people, in, early, renaissance, in, the, field, of, archaeology, petrarch, even, offered, to, purchase, boccaccio, s, library, so, that, it, would, become, part, of, petrarch, s, library, however, upon, boccaccio, s, death, his, entire, collection, was, given, to, the, monastery, of, santo, spirito, in, florence, where, it, still, resides, bocaccio, s, final, years, were, troubled, by, illnesses, some, relating, to, obesity, and, what, often, is, described, as, dropsy, severe, edema, that, would, be, described, today, as, congestive, heart, failure, he, died, on, 21, december, 1375, in, certaldo, where, he, is, buried, see, consoli, s, bibliography, for, an,
