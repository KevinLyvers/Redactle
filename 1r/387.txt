chest, of, drawers, took, up, a, piece, of, paper, began, to, write, remaining, upright, all, the, while, since, i, always, stand, when, i, can, i, wrote, thirty, some, poems, in, a, row, all, in, a, kind, of, ecstasy, the, nature, of, which, i, shall, never, fathom, it, was, the, triumphant, day, of, my, life, and, i, shall, never, have, another, like, it, i, began, with, a, title, the, keeper, of, sheep, and, what, followed, was, the, appearance, of, someone, within, me, to, whom, i, promptly, assigned, the, name, of, alberto, caeiro, please, excuse, the, absurdity, of, what, i, am, about, to, say, but, there, had, appeared, within, me, then, and, there, my, own, master, it, was, my, immediate, sensation, so, much, so, that, with, those, thirty, odd, poems, written, i, immediately, took, up, another, sheet, of, paper, and, wrote, as, well, in, a, row, the, six, poems, that, make, up, oblique, rain, by, fernando, pessoa, immediately, and, totally, it, was, the, return, from, fernando, pessoa, alberto, caeiro, to, fernando, pessoa, alone, or, better, still, it, was, fernando, pessoa, s, reaction, to, his, own, inexistence, as, alberto, caeiro, as, the, heteronym, coelho, pacheco, over, a, long, period, pessoa, s, triumphant, day, was, taken, as, real, however, it, has, been, proved, that, this, event, was, one, more, fiction, created, by, pessoa, pessoa, s, earliest, heteronym, at, the, age, of, six, was, chevalier, de, pas, a, fictitious, knight, whom, he, wrote, to, himself, as, other, childhood, heteronyms, included, the, poet, dr, pancr, cio, and, short, story, writer, david, merrick, followed, by, charles, robert, anon, a, young, englishman, who, became, pessoa, s, alter, ego, when, pessoa, was, a, student, at, the, university, of, lisbon, anon, was, replaced, by, alexander, search, search, represented, a, transition, heteronym, that, pessoa, used, while, searching, to, adapt, to, the, portuguese, cultural, reality, as, a, result, pessoa, would, write, many, english, poems, specifically, sonnets, and, short, stories, under, the, search, heteronym, including, a, very, original, dinner, which, was, posthumously, published, after, its, recovery, and, subsequent, reproduction, by, portuguese, literary, historian, maria, leonor, machado, de, sousa, after, the, 5, october, 1910, revolution, and, its, subsequently, patriotic, atmosphere, pessoa, created, another, alter, ego, lvaro, de, campos, supposedly, a, portuguese, naval, and, mechanical, engineer, who, was, born, in, tavira, hometown, of, pessoa, s, ancestors, and, graduated, in, glasgow, translator, and, literary, critic, richard, zenith, notes, that, pessoa, eventually, established, at, least, seventy, two, heteronyms, according, to, pessoa, himself, zenith, says, there, were, three, main, heteronyms, of, them, all, alberto, caeiro, lvaro, de, campos, and, ricardo, reis, pessoa, s, heteronyms, differ, from, pen, names, as, they, possess, distinct, biographies, temperaments, philosophies, appearances, writing, styles, and, even, signatures, thus, heteronyms, often, disagree, on, various, topics, as, well, as, argue, and, discuss, with, each, other, about, literature, aesthetics, philosophy, and, so, on, regarding, the, heteronyms, pessoa, wrote, how, do, i, write, in, the, name, of, these, three, caeiro, through, sheer, and, unexpected, inspiration, without, knowing, or, even, suspecting, that, i, m, going, to, write, in, his, name, ricardo, reis, after, an, abstract, meditation, which, suddenly, takes, concrete, shape, in, an, ode, campos, when, i, feel, a, sudden, impulse, to, write, and, don, t, know, what, my, semi, heteronym, bernardo, soares, who, in, many, ways, resembles, lvaro, de, campos, always, appears, when, i, m, sleepy, or, drowsy, so, that, my, qualities, of, inhibition, and, rational, thought, are, suspended, his, prose, is, an, endless, reverie, he, s, a, semi, heteronym, because, his, personality, although, not, my, own, doesn, t, differ, from, my, own, but, is, a, mere, mutilation, of, it, he, s, me, without, my, rationalism, and, emotions, his, prose, is, the, same, as, mine, except, for, certain, formal, restraint, that, reason, imposes, on, my, own, writing, and, his, portuguese, is, exactly, the, same, whereas, caeiro, writes, bad, portuguese, campos, writes, it, reasonably, well, but, with, mistakes, such, as, me, myself, instead, of, i, myself, etc, and, reis, writes, better, than, i, but, with, a, purism, i, find, excessive, alberto, caeiro, was, the, first, heteronym, which, pessoa, considered, to, be, great, or, seminal, through, that, heteronym, pessoa, wrote, exclusively, poetry, according, to, an, anthology, edited, by, jer, nimo, pizarro, and, patricio, ferrari, titled, the, collected, works, of, alberto, caeiro, this, imaginary, author, was, a, shepherd, who, spent, most, of, his, life, in, the, countryside, had, almost, no, education, and, was, ignorant, of, most, literature, critics, note, that, caeiro, s, poems, demonstrate, wide, eyed, childlike, wonder, at, nature, octavio, paz, in, translating, his, work, refers, to, him, as, an, innocent, poet, specifically, paz, observes, caeiro, s, willingness, to, accept, reality, as, such, rather, than, attempting, to, dress, it, up, in, what, other, poets, would, consider, to, be, aesthetic, rather, than, using, poetry, as, an, interpretative, and, transformative, device, paz, argues, caeiro, simply, wrote, poetry, as, such, in, other, words, caiero, s, method, is, phenomenological, as, opposed, to, aesthetic, such, a, philosophy, makes, caeiro, contrast, greatly, with, his, creator, pessoa, who, was, deferential, to, modernism, and, thus, interrogates, the, world, around, him, rather, than, merely, experience, it, pessoa, regarded, him, as, follows, he, sees, things, with, the, eyes, only, not, with, the, mind, he, does, not, let, any, thoughts, arise, when, he, looks, at, a, flower, the, only, thing, a, stone, tells, him, is, that, it, has, nothing, at, all, to, tell, him, this, way, of, looking, at, a, stone, may, be, described, as, the, totally, unpoetic, way, of, looking, at, it, the, stupendous, fact, about, caeiro, is, that, out, of, this, sentiment, or, rather, absence, of, sentiment, he, makes, poetry, the, critic, jane, m, sheets, notes, that, the, creation, of, caeiro, was, a, necessary, precursor, to, the, later, heteronyms, to, follow, by, providing, a, universalizing, poetic, vision, from, which, others, could, be, derived, while, caeiro, was, a, short, lived, heteronym, in, pessoa, s, career, it, established, several, tenets, which, would, inevitably, appear, in, the, works, of, campos, reis, and, pessoa, s, own, work, in, a, letter, to, william, bentley, pessoa, wrote, that, a, knowledge, of, the, language, would, be, indispensable, for, instance, to, appraise, the, odes, of, ricardo, reis, whose, portuguese, would, draw, upon, him, the, blessing, of, ant, nio, vieira, as, his, stile, and, diction, that, of, horace, he, has, been, called, admirably, i, believe, a, greek, horace, who, writes, in, portuguese, reis, both, a, character, and, a, heteronym, of, fernando, pessoa, himself, sums, up, his, philosophy, of, life, in, his, own, words, admonishing, see, life, from, a, distance, never, question, it, there, s, nothing, it, can, tell, you, like, caeiro, whom, he, admires, reis, defers, from, questioning, life, he, prides, himself, as, a, modern, pagan, who, urges, one, to, seize, the, day, and, accept, fate, with, tranquility, wise, is, the, one, who, does, not, seek, the, seeker, will, find, in, all, things, the, abyss, and, doubt, in, himself, in, such, sense, reis, shares, essential, affinities, with, caeiro, believing, in, the, greek, gods, yet, living, in, a, christian, europe, reis, feels, that, his, spiritual, life, is, limited, and, true, happiness, cannot, be, attained, such, feeling, paired, with, his, belief, in, fate, as, a, driving, force, for, all, that, exists, and, thus, disregarding, freedom, leads, to, his, epicureanist, philosophy, which, entails, the, avoidance, of, pain, defending, that, man, should, seek, tranquility, and, calm, above, all, else, avoiding, emotional, extremes, where, caeiro, wrote, freely, and, spontaneously, with, joviality, of, his, basic, meaningless, connection, to, the, world, reis, writes, in, an, austere, cerebral, manner, with, premeditated, rhythm, and, structure, and, a, particular, attention, to, the, correct, use, of, the, language, when, approaching, his, subjects, of, as, characterized, by, richard, zenith, the, brevity, of, life, the, vanity, of, wealth, and, struggle, the, joy, of, simple, pleasures, patience, in, time, of, trouble, and, avoidance, of, extremes, in, his, detached, intellectual, approach, he, is, closer, to, fernando, pessoa, s, constant, rationalization, as, such, representing, the, orthonym, s, wish, for, measure, and, sobriety, and, a, world, free, of, troubles, and, respite, in, stark, contrast, to, caeiro, s, spirit, and, style, as, such, where, caeiro, s, predominant, attitude, is, that, of, joviality, his, sadness, being, accepted, as, natural, my, sadness, is, a, comfort, for, it, is, natural, and, right, reis, is, marked, by, melancholy, saddened, by, the, impermanence, of, all, things, ricardo, reis, is, the, main, character, of, jos, saramago, s, 1986, novel, the, year, of, the, death, of, ricardo, reis, lvaro, de, campos, manifests, in, a, way, as, a, hyperbolic, version, of, pessoa, himself, of, the, three, heteronyms, he, is, the, one, who, feels, most, strongly, his, motto, being, to, feel, everything, in, every, way, the, best, way, to, travel, he, wrote, is, to, feel, as, such, his, poetry, is, the, most, emotionally, intense, and, varied, constantly, juggling, two, fundamental, impulses, on, the, one, hand, a, feverish, desire, to, be, and, feel, everything, and, everyone, declaring, that, in, every, corner, of, my, soul, stands, an, altar, to, a, different, god, alluding, to, walt, whitman, s, desire, to, contain, multitudes, on, the, other, a, wish, for, a, state, of, isolation, and, a, sense, of, nothingness, as, a, result, his, mood, and, principles, varied, between, violent, dynamic, exultation, as, he, fervently, wishes, to, experience, the, entirety, of, the, universe, in, himself, in, all, manners, possible, a, particularly, distinctive, trait, in, this, state, being, his, futuristic, leanings, including, the, expression, of, great, enthusiasm, as, to, the, meaning, of, city, life, and, its, components, and, a, state, of, nostalgic, melancholy, where, life, is, viewed, as, essentially, empty, one, of, the, poet, s, constant, preoccupations, as, part, of, his, dichotomous, character, is, that, of, identity, he, does, not, know, who, he, is, or, rather, fails, at, achieving, an, ideal, identity, wanting, to, be, everything, and, inevitably, failing, he, despairs, unlike, caeiro, who, asks, nothing, of, life, he, asks, too, much, in, his, poetic, meditation, tobacco, shop, he, asks, how, should, i, know, what, i, ll, be, i, who, don, t, know, what, i, am, to, be, what, i, think, but, i, think, of, being, so, many, things, mensagem, written, in, portuguese, is, a, symbolist, epic, made, up, of,

still, bent, on, accomplishing, a, universal, empire, the, third, cycle, called, o, encoberto, the, hidden, one, refers, to, pessoa, s, vision, of, a, future, world, of, peace, and, the, fifth, empire, which, according, to, pessoa, is, spiritual, and, not, material, because, if, it, were, material, england, would, already, have, achieved, it, after, the, age, of, force, vis, and, taedium,

dreaming, and, believing, that, it, s, possible, to, achieve, dreams, one, of, the, most, famous, quotes, from, mensagem, is, the, first, line, from, o, infante, belonging, to, the, second, part, which, is, deus, quer, o, homem, sonha, a, obra, nasce, which, translates, roughly, to, god, wishes, man, dreams, the, work, is, born, another, well, known, quote, from, mensagem, is, the, first,

trends, on, the, other, hand, he, does, not, care, much, for, a, methodology, of, analysis, or, problems, in, the, history, of, ideas, he, states, his, confidence, that, portugal, would, soon, produce, a, great, poet, a, super, cam, es, pledged, to, make, an, important, contribution, for, european, culture, and, indeed, for, humanity, the, philosophical, notes, of, the, young, pessoa, mostly, written, between, 1905, and, 1912, illustrate, his, debt, to, the, history, of, philosophy, more, through, commentators, than, through, a, first, hand, protracted, reading, of, the, classics, ancient, or, modern, the, issues, he, engages, with, pertain, to, every, philosophical, discipline, and, concern, a, large, profusion, of, concepts, creating, a, vast, semantic, spectrum, in, texts, whose, length, varies, between, half, a, dozen, lines, and, half, a, dozen, pages, and, whose, density, of, analysis, is, extremely, variable, simple, paraphrasis, expression, of, assumptions, and, original, speculation, pessoa, sorted, the, philosophical, systems, thus, such, pantheist, transcendentalism, is, used, by, pessoa, to, define, the, project, that, encompasses, and, exceeds, all, systems, to, characterize, the, new, poetry, of, saudosismo, where, the, typical, contradiction, of, this, system, occurs, to, inquire, of, the, particular, social, and, political, results, of, its, adoption, as, the, leading, cultural, paradigm, and, at, last, he, hints, that, metaphysics, and, religiosity, strive, to, find, in, everything, a, beyond, poetry, from, fernando, pessoa, appears, in, many, films, for, example, a, quote, from, autopsychography, opens, the, korean, film, the, cage, 2017, by, director, lior, shamriz, the, 1982, film, five, and, the, skin, was, based, on, pessoa, s,

translations, of, lu, s, de, cam, es, fernando, pessoa, and, carlos, drummond, de, andrade, he, compared, his, experiences, translating, archaic, vs, contemporary, linguistic, registers, highly, formal, poetry, vs, free, verse, and, european, vs, brazilian, portuguese, and, he, discussed, the, unique, challenge, of, translating, and, researching, a, biography, of, a, poet, such, as, pessoa, with, alter, egos, that, wrote, in, radically, different, styles, richard, zenith, presented, a, lecture, on, fernando, pessoa, one, of, portugal, s, most, important, literary, figures, of, the, 20th, century, and, a, towering, figure, in, modernism, in, this, poem, pessoa, creates, an, inner, struggle, that, the, speaker, has, with, trying, to, figure, out, whether, it, was, fate, or, free, will, that, has, determined, how, his, life, panned, out, by, making, the, whole, poem, essentially, one, elongated, metaphor, pessoa, is, able, to, give, multiple, interpretations, to, his, poem, in, the, titular, first, line, of, the, first, stanza, pessoa, states, i, don, t, know, how, many, souls, i, have, automatically, pessoa, causes, the, speaker, to, question, his, morality, and, inner, being, line, two, of, the, first, stanza, has, a, literal, translation, of, each, time, changed, when, put, in, context, it, becomes, apparent, that, the, speaker, is, referring, to, himself, that, changes, so, often, these, two, lines, become, the, foundation, for, the, rest, of, the, poem, seeing, as, they, set, up, a, questioning, within, the, speaker, the, translations, of, these, two, lines, are, also, crucial, to, fully, grasp, the, meaning, of, the, poem, as, a, whole
