ernst, heinrich, philipp, august, haeckel, german, 16, february, 1834, 9, august, 1919, was, a, german, zoologist, naturalist, eugenicist, philosopher, physician, professor, marine, biologist, and, artist, he, discovered, described, and, named, thousands, of, new, species, mapped, a, genealogical, tree, relating, all, life, forms, and, coined, many, terms, in, biology, including, ecology, phylum, phylogeny, and, protista, haeckel, promoted, and, popularised, charles, darwin, s, work, in, germany, and, developed, the, influential, but, no, longer, widely, held, recapitulation, theory, ontogeny, recapitulates, phylogeny, claiming, that, an, individual, organism, s, biological, development, or, ontogeny, parallels, and, summarises, its, species, evolutionary, development, or, phylogeny, the, published, artwork, of, haeckel, includes, over, 100, detailed, multi, colour, illustrations, of, animals, and, sea, creatures, collected, in, his, kunstformen, der, natur, art, forms, of, nature, a, book, which, would, go, on, to, influence, the, art, nouveau, artistic, movement, as, a, philosopher, ernst, haeckel, wrote, die, weltr, thsel, 1895, 1899, in, english, the, riddles, of, the, universe, 1900, the, genesis, for, the, term, world, riddle, weltr, tsel, and, freedom, in, science, and, teaching, to, support, teaching, evolution, haeckel, was, also, a, promoter, of, scientific, racism, and, embraced, the, idea, of, social, darwinism, he, was, the, first, person, to, characterize, the, great, war, the, first, world, war, which, he, did, as, early, as, 1914, ernst, haeckel, was, born, on, 16, february, 1834, in, potsdam, then, part, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, 1852, haeckel, completed, studies, at, the, domgymnasium, the, cathedral, high, school, of, merseburg, he, then, studied, medicine, in, berlin, and, w, rzburg, particularly, with, albert, von, k, lliker, franz, leydig, rudolf, virchow, with, whom, he, later, worked, briefly, as, assistant, and, with, the, anatomist, physiologist, johannes, peter, m, ller, 1801, 1858, together, with, hermann, steudner, he, attended, botany, lectures, in, w, rzburg, in, 1857, haeckel, attained, a, doctorate, in, medicine, and, afterwards, he, received, the, license, to, practice, medicine, the, occupation, of, physician, appeared, less, worthwhile, to, haeckel, after, contact, with, suffering, patients, haeckel, studied, under, carl, gegenbaur, at, the, university, of, jena, for, three, years, in, 1861, he, earned, a, habilitation, in, comparative, anatomy, and, became, a, professor, of, zoology, at, the, university, at, jena, where, he, remained, for, 47, years, from, 1862, to, 1909, between, 1859, and, 1866, haeckel, worked, on, many, phyla, such, as, radiolarians, poriferans, sponges, and, annelids, segmented, worms, during, a, trip, to, the, mediterranean, haeckel, named, nearly, 150, new, species, of, radiolarians, from, 1866, to, 1867, haeckel, made, an, extended, journey, to, the, canary, islands, with, hermann, fol, on, 17, october, 1866, he, arrived, in, london, over, the, next, few, days, he, met, charles, lyell, and, visited, thomas, huxley, and, family, at, their, home, on, 21, october, he, visited, charles, darwin, at, down, house, in, kent, in, 1867, he, married, agnes, huschke, their, son, walter, was, born, in, 1868, their, daughters, elizabeth, in, 1871, and, emma, in, 1873, in, 1869, he, traveled, as, a, researcher, to, norway, in, 1871, to, croatia, where, he, lived, on, the, island, of, hvar, in, a, monastery, and, in, 1873, to, egypt, turkey, and, greece, in, 1907, he, had, a, museum, built, in, jena, to, teach, the, public, about, evolution, haeckel, retired, from, teaching, in, 1909, and, in, 1910, he, withdrew, from, the, evangelical, church, of, prussia, on, the, occasion, of, his, 80th, birthday, celebration, he, was, presented, with, a, two, volume, work, entitled, was, wir, ernst, haeckel, verdanken, what, we, owe, to, ernst, haeckel, edited, at, the, request, of, the, german, monistenbund, by, heinrich, schmidt, of, jena, in, 1864, his, first, wife, anna, sethe, died, haeckel, dedicated, some, species, of, jellyfish, that, he, found, beautiful, such, as, desmonema, annasethe, to, her, haeckel, s, second, wife, agnes, died, in, 1915, and, he, became, substantially, frailer, breaking, his, leg, and, arm, he, sold, his, villa, medusa, in, jena, in, 1918, to, the, carl, zeiss, foundation, which, preserved, his, library, haeckel, died, on, 9, august, 1919, in, monism, as, connecting, religion, and, science, 1892, he, argued, in, favor, of, monism, as, the, view, most, compatible, with, the, current, scientific, understanding, of, the, natural, world, his, perspective, of, monism, was, pantheistic, and, impersonal, the, monistic, idea, of, god, which, alone, is, compatible, with, our, present, knowledge, of, nature, recognizes, the, divine, spirit, in, all, things, it, can, never, recognise, in, god, a, personal, being, or, in, other, words, an, individual, of, limited, extension, in, space, or, even, of, human, form, god, is, everywhere, haeckel, became, the, most, famous, proponent, of, monism, in, germany, in, 1906, haeckel, belonged, to, the, founders, of, the, monist, league, deutscher, monistenbund, which, took, a, stance, against, philosophical, materialism, and, promote, a, natural, weltanschauung, this, organization, lasted, until, 1933, and, included, such, notable, members, as, wilhelm, ostwald, georg, von, arco, 1869, 1940, helene, st, cker, and, walter, arthur, berendsohn, haeckel, s, affinity, for, the, german, romantic, movement, coupled, with, his, acceptance, of, a, form, of, lamarckism, influenced, his, political, beliefs, rather, than, being, a, strict, darwinian, haeckel, believed, that, the, characteristics, of, an, organism, were, acquired, through, interactions, with, the, environment, and, that, ontogeny, reflected, phylogeny, he, saw, the, social, sciences, as, instances, of, applied, biology, and, that, phrase, was, picked, up, and, used, for, nazi, propaganda, he, was, the, first, person, to, use, the, term, first, world, war, about, world, war, i, however, haeckel, s, books, were, banned, by, the, nazi, party, which, refused, monism, and, haeckel, s, freedom, of, thought, moreover, it, is, worth, mentioning, that, haeckel, had, often, overtly, recognized, the, great, contribution, of, educated, jews, to, the, german, culture, haeckel, was, a, zoologist, an, accomplished, artist, and, illustrator, and, later, a, professor, of, comparative, anatomy, although, haeckel, s, ideas, are, important, to, the, history, of, evolutionary, theory, and, although, he, was, a, competent, invertebrate, anatomist, most, famous, for, his, work, on, radiolaria, many, speculative, concepts, that, he, championed, are, now, considered, incorrect, for, example, haeckel, described, and, named, hypothetical, ancestral, microorganisms, that, have, never, been, found, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, consider, psychology, as, a, branch, of, physiology, he, also, proposed, the, kingdom, protista, in, 1866, his, chief, interests, lay, in, evolution, and, life, development, processes, in, general, including, development, of, nonrandom, form, which, culminated, in, the, beautifully, illustrated, kunstformen, der, natur, art, forms, of, nature, haeckel, did, not, support, natural, selection, rather, believing, in, lamarckism, haeckel, advanced, a, version, of, the, earlier, recapitulation, theory, previously, set, out, by, tienne, serres, in, the, 1820s, and, supported, by, followers, of, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, including, robert, edmond, grant, it, proposed, a, link, between, ontogeny, development, of, form, and, phylogeny, evolutionary, descent, summed, up, by, haeckel, in, the, phrase, ontogeny, recapitulates, phylogeny, his, concept, of, recapitulation, has, been, refuted, in, the, form, he, gave, it, now, called, strong, recapitulation, in, favour, of, the, ideas, first, advanced, by, karl, ernst, von, baer, the, strong, recapitulation, hypothesis, views, ontogeny, as, repeating, forms, of, adult, ancestors, while, weak, recapitulation, means, that, what, is, repeated, and, built, upon, is, the, ancestral, embryonic, development, process, haeckel, supported, the, theory, with, embryo, drawings, that, have, since, been, shown, to, be, oversimplified, and, in, part, inaccurate, and, the, theory, is, now, considered, an, oversimplification, of, quite, complicated, relationships, however, comparison, of, embryos, remains, a, powerful, way, to, demonstrate, that, all, animals, are, related, haeckel, introduced, the, concept, of, heterochrony, the, change, in, timing, of, embryonic, development, over, the, course, of, evolution, haeckel, was, a, flamboyant, figure, who, sometimes, took, great, non, scientific, leaps, from, available, evidence, for, example, at, the, time, when, darwin, published, on, the, origin, of, species, by, means, of, natural, selection, 1859, haeckel, postulated, that, evidence, of, human, evolution, would, be, found, in, the, dutch, east, indies, now, indonesia, at, that, time, no, remains, of, human, ancestors, had, yet, been, identified, he, described, these, theoretical, remains, in, great, detail, and, even, named, the, as, yet, unfound, species, pithecanthropus, alalus, and, instructed, his, students, such, as, richard, and, oskar, hertwig, to, go, and, find, it, one, student, did, find, some, remains, a, dutchman, named, eug, ne, dubois, searched, the, east, indies, from, 1887, to, 1895, discovering, the, remains, of, java, man, in, 1891, consisting, of, a, skullcap, thighbone, and, a, few, teeth, these, remains, are, among, the, oldest, hominid, remains, ever, found, dubois, classified, java, man, with, haeckel, s, pithecanthropus, label, though, they, were, later, reclassified, as, homo, erectus, some, scientists, of, the, day, suggested, dubois, java, man, as, a, potential, intermediate, form, between, modern, humans, and, the, common, ancestor, we, share, with, the, other, great, apes, the, current, consensus, of, anthropologists, is, that, the, direct, ancestors, of, modern, humans, were, african, populations, of, homo, erectus, possibly, homo, ergaster, rather, than, the, asian, populations, exemplified, by, java, man, and, peking, man, ironically, a, new, human, species, homo, floresiensis, a, dwarf, human, type, has, recently, been, discovered, in, the, island, of, flores, the, creationist, polygenism, of, samuel, george, morton, and, louis, agassiz, which, presented, human, races, as, separately, created, species, was, rejected, by, charles, darwin, who, argued, for, the, monogenesis, of, the, human, species, and, the, african, origin, of, modern, humans, in, contrast, to, most, of, darwin, s, supporters, haeckel, put, forward, a, doctrine, of, evolutionary, polygenism, based, on, the, ideas, of, the, linguist, august, schleicher, in, which, several, different, language, groups, had, arisen, separately, from, speechless, prehuman, urmenschen, german, proto, humans, which, themselves, had, evolved, from, simian, ancestors, these, separate, languages, had, completed, the, transition, from, animals, to, man, and, under, the, influence, of, each, main, branch, of, languages, humans, had, evolved, in, a, kind, of, lamarckian, use, inheritance, as, separate, species, which, could, be, subdivided, into, races, from, this, haeckel, drew, the, implication, that, languages, with, the, most, potential, yield, the, human, races, with, the, most, potential, led, by, the, semitic, and, indo, germanic, groups, with, berber, jewish, greco, roman, and, germanic, varieties, to, the, fore, as, haeckel, stated, we, must, mention, here, one, of, the, most, important, results, of, the, comparative, study, of, languages, which, for, the, stammbaum, of, the, species, of, men, is, of, the, highest, significance, namely, that, human, languages, probably, had, a, multiple, or, polyphyletic, origin, human, language, as, such, probably, developed, only, after, the, species, of, speechless, urmenschen, or, affenmenschen, german, ape, men, had, split, into, several, species, or, kinds, with, each, of, these, human, species, language, developed, on, its, own, and, independently, of, the, others, at, least, this, is, the, view, of, schleicher, one, of, the, foremost, authorities, on, this, subject, if, one, views, the, origin, of, the, branches, of, language, as, the, special, and, principal, act, of, becoming, human, and, the, species, of, humankind, as, distinguished, according, to, their, language, stem, then, one, can, say, that, the, different, species, of, men, arose, independently, of, one, another, haeckel, s, view, can, be, seen, as, a, forerunner, of, the, views, of, carleton, coon, who, also, believed, that, human, races, evolved, independently, and, in, parallel, with, each, other, these, ideas, eventually, fell, from, favour, haeckel, also, applied, the, hypothesis, of, polygenism, to, the, modern, diversity, of, human, groups, he, became, a, key, figure, in, social, darwinism, and, leading, proponent, of, scientific, racism, stating, for, instance, the, caucasian, or, mediterranean, man, homo, mediterraneus, has, from, time, immemorial, been, placed, at, the, head, of, all, the, races, of, men, as, the, most, highly, developed, and, perfect, it, is, generally, called, the, caucasian, race, but, as, among, all, the, varieties, of, the, species, the, caucasian, branch, is, the, least, important, we, prefer, the, much, more, suitable, appellation, proposed, by, friedrich, m, ller, namely, that, of, mediterranese, for, the, most, important, varieties, of, this, species, which, are, moreover, the, most, eminent, actors, in, what, is, called, universal, history, first, rose, to, a, flourishing, condition, on, the, shores, of, the, mediterranean, this, species, alone, with, the, exception, of, the, mongolian, has, had, an, actual, history, it, alone, has, attained, to, that, degree, of, civilisation, which, seems, to, raise, men, above, the, rest, of, nature, haeckel, divided, human, beings, into, ten, races, of, which, the, caucasian, was, the, highest, and, the, primitives, were, doomed, to, extinction, in, his, view, negroes, were, savages, and, whites, were, the, most, civilised, for, instance, he, claimed, that, he, negro, had, stronger, and, more, freely, movable, toes, than, any, other, race, which, he, argued, was, evidence, of, their, being, less, evolved, and, which, led, him, to, compare, them, to, four, handed, apes, in, his, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, harvard, paleontologist, stephen, jay, gould, wrote, evolutionary, racism, his, call, to, the, german, people, for, racial, purity, and, unflinching, devotion, to, a, just, state, his, belief, that, harsh, inexorable, laws, of, evolution, ruled, human, civilization, and, nature, alike, conferring, upon, favored, races, the, right, to, dominate, others, all, contributed, to, the, rise, of, nazism, in, his, introduction, to, the, nazi, party, ideologue, alfred, rosenberg, s, 1930, book, peter, peel, affirms, that, rosenberg, had, indeed, read, haeckel, in, the, same, line, of, thought, historian, daniel, gasman, states, that, haeckel, s, ideology, stimulated, the, birth, of, fascist, ideology, in, italy, and, france, however, in, 2009, robert, j, richards, noted, haeckel, on, his, travels, to, ceylon, and, indonesia, often, formed, closer, and, more, intimate, relations, with, natives, even, members, of, the, untouchable, classes, than, with, the, european, colonials, and, says, the, nazis, rejected, haeckel, since, he, opposed, antisemitism, while, supporting, ideas, they, disliked, for, instance, atheism, feminism, internationalism, pacifism, etc, the, jena, declaration, published, by, the, german, zoological, society, rejects, the, idea, of, human, races, and, distances, itself, from, the, racial, theories, of, ernst, haeckel, and, other, 20th, century, scientists, it, claims, that, genetic, variation, between, human, populations, is, smaller, than, within, them, demonstrating, that, the, biological, concept, of, races, is, invalid, the, statement, highlights, that, there, are, no, specific, genes, or, genetic, markers, that, match, with, conventional, racial, categorizations, it, also, indicates, that, the, idea, of, races, is, based, on, racism, rather, than, any, scientific, factuality, haeckel, claimed, the, origin, of, humanity, was, to, be, found, in, asia, he, believed, that, hindustan, indian, subcontinent, was, the, actual, location, where, the, first, humans, had, evolved, haeckel, argued, that, humans, were, closely, related, to, the, primates, of, southeast, asia, and, rejected, darwin, s, hypothesis, of, africa, haeckel, later, claimed, that, the, missing, link, was, to, be, found, on, the, lost, continent, of, lemuria, located, in, the, indian, ocean, he, believed, that, lemuria, was, the, home, of, the, first, humans, and, that, asia, was, the, home, of, many, of, the, earliest, primates, he, thus, supported, that, asia, was, the, cradle, of, hominid, evolution, haeckel, also, claimed, that, lemuria, connected, asia, and, africa, which, allowed, the, migration, of, humans, to, the, rest, of, the, world, in, haeckel, s, book, the, history, of, creation, 1884, he, included, migration, routes, which, he, thought, the, first, humans, had, used, outside, of, lemuria, when, haeckel, was, a, student, in, the, 1850s, he, showed, great, interest, in, embryology, attending, the, rather, unpopular, lectures, twice, and, in, his, notes, sketched, the, visual, aids, textbooks, had, few, illustrations, and, large, format, plates, were, used, to, show, students, how, to, see, the, tiny, forms, under, a, reflecting, microscope, with, the, translucent, tissues, seen, against, a, black, background, developmental, series, were, used, to, show, stages, within, a, species, but, inconsistent, views, and, stages, made, it, even, more, difficult, to, compare, different, species, it, was, agreed, by, all, european, evolutionists, that, all, vertebrates, looked, very, similar, at, an, early, stage, in, what, was, thought, of, as, a, common, ideal, type, but, there, was, a, continuing, debate, from, the, 1820s, between, the, romantic, recapitulation, theory, that, human, embryos, developed, through, stages, of, the, forms, of, all, the, major, groups, of, adult, animals, literally, manifesting, a, sequence, of, organisms, on, a, linear, chain, of, being, and, karl, ernst, von, baer, s, opposing, view, stated, in, von, baer, s, laws, of, embryology, that, the, early, general, forms, diverged, into, four, major, groups, of, specialised, forms, without, ever, resembling, the, adult, of, another, species, showing, affinity, to, an, archetype, but, no, relation, to, other, types, or, any, transmutation, of, species, by, the, time, haeckel, was, teaching, he, was, able, to, use, a, textbook, with, woodcut, illustrations, written, by, his, own, teacher, albert, von, k, lliker, which, purported, to, explain, human, development, while, also, using, other, mammalian, embryos, to, claim, a, coherent, sequence, despite, the, significance, to, ideas, of, transformism, this, was, not, really, polite, enough, for, the, new, popular, science, writing, and, was, a, matter, for, medical, institutions, and, for, experts, who, could, make, their, own, comparisons, 264, 267, darwin, s, on, the, origin, of, species, which, made, a, powerful, impression, on, haeckel, when, he, read, it, in, 1864, was, very, cautious, about, the, possibility, of, ever, reconstructing, the, history, of, life, but, did, include, a, section, reinterpreting, von, baer, s, embryology, and, revolutionising, the, field, of, study, concluding, that, embryology, rises, greatly, in, interest, when, we, thus, look, at, the, embryo, as, a, picture, more, or, less, obscured, of, the, common, parent, form, of, each, great, class, of, animals, it, mentioned, von, baer, s, 1828, anecdote, misattributing, it, to, louis, agassiz, that, at, an, early, stage, embryos, were, so, similar, that, it, could, be, impossible, to, tell, whether, an, unlabelled, specimen, was, of, a, mammal, a, bird, or, of, a, reptile, and, darwin, s, own, research, using, embryonic, stages, of, barnacles, to, show, that, they, are, crustaceans, while, cautioning, against, the, idea, that, one, organism, or, embryonic, stage, is, higher, or, lower, or, more, or, less, evolved, haeckel, disregarded, such, caution, and, in, a, year, wrote, his, massive, and, ambitious, generelle, morphologie, published, in, 1866, presenting, a, revolutionary, new, synthesis, of, darwin, s, ideas, with, the, german, tradition, of, naturphilosophie, going, back, to, goethe, and, with, the, progressive, evolutionism, of, lamarck, in, what, he, called, darwinismus, he, used, morphology, to, reconstruct, the, evolutionary, history, of, life, in, the, absence, of, fossil, evidence, using, embryology, as, evidence, of, ancestral, relationships, he, invented, new, terms, including, ontogeny, and, phylogeny, to, present, his, evolutionised, recapitulation, theory, that, ontogeny, recapitulated, phylogeny, the, two, massive, volumes, sold, poorly, and, were, heavy, going, with, his, limited, understanding, of, german, darwin, found, them, impossible, to, read, haeckel, s, publisher, turned, down, a, proposal, for, a, strictly, scholarly, and, objective, second, edition, 269, 270, haeckel, s, aim, was, a, reformed, morphology, with, evolution, as, the, organising, principle, of, a, cosmic, synthesis, unifying, science, religion, and, art, he, was, giving, successful, popular, lectures, on, his, ideas, to, students, and, townspeople, in, jena, in, an, approach, pioneered, by, his, teacher, rudolf, virchow, to, meet, his, publisher, s, need, for, a, popular, work, he, used, a, student, s, transcript, of, his, lectures, as, the, basis, of, his, nat, rliche, sch, pfungsgeschichte, of, 1868, presenting, a, comprehensive, presentation, of, evolution, in, the, spring, of, that, year, he, drew, figures, for, the, book, synthesising, his, views, of, specimens, in, jena, and, published, pictures, to, represent, types, after, publication, he, told, a, colleague, that, the, images, are, completely, exact, partly, copied, from, nature, partly, assembled, from, all, illustrations, of, these, early, stages, that, have, hitherto, become, known, there, were, various, styles, of, embryological, drawings, at, that, time, ranging, from, more, schematic, representations, to, naturalistic, illustrations, of, specific, specimens, haeckel, believed, privately, that, his, figures, were, both, exact, and, synthetic, and, in, public, asserted, that, they, were, schematic, like, most, figures, used, in, teaching, the, images, were, reworked, to, match, in, size, and, orientation, and, though, displaying, haeckel, s, own, views, of, essential, features, they, support, von, baer, s, concept, that, vertebrate, embryos, begin, similarly, and, then, diverge, relating, different, images, on, a, grid, conveyed, a, powerful, evolutionary, message, as, a, book, for, the, general, public, it, followed, the, common, practice, of, not, citing, sources, 270, 274, the, book, sold, very, well, and, while, some, anatomical, experts, hostile, to, haeckel, s, evolutionary, views, expressed, some, private, concerns, that, certain, figures, had, been, drawn, rather, freely, the, figures, showed, what, they, already, knew, about, similarities, in, embryos, the, first, published, concerns, came, from, ludwig, r, timeyer, a, professor, of, zoology, and, comparative, anatomy, at, the, university, of, basel, who, had, placed, fossil, mammals, in, an, evolutionary, lineage, early, in, the, 1860s, and, had, been, sent, a, complimentary, copy, at, the, end, of, 1868, his, review, in, the, archiv, f, r, anthropologie, wondered, about, the, claim, that, the, work, was, popular, and, scholarly, doubting, whether, the, second, was, true, and, expressed, horror, about, such, public, discussion, of, man, s, place, in, nature, with, illustrations, such, as, the, evolutionary, trees, being, shown, to, non, experts, though, he, made, no, suggestion, that, embryo, illustrations, should, be, directly, based, on, specimens, to, him, the, subject, demanded, the, utmost, scrupulosity, and, conscientiousness, and, an, artist, must, not, arbitrarily, model, or, generalise, his, originals, for, speculative, purposes, which, he, considered, proved, by, comparison, with, works, by, other, authors, in, particular, one, and, the, same, moreover, incorrectly, interpreted, woodcut, is, presented, to, the, reader, three, times, in, a, row, and, with, three, different, captions, as, embryo, of, the, dog, the, chick, the, turtle, he, accused, haeckel, of, playing, fast, and, loose, with, the, public, and, with, science, and, failing, to, live, up, to, the, obligation, to, the, truth, of, every, serious, researcher, haeckel, responded, with, angry, accusations, of, bowing, to, religious, prejudice, but, in, the, second, 1870, edition, changed, the, duplicated, embryo, images, to, a, single, image, captioned, embryo, of, a, mammal, or, bird, duplication, using, galvanoplastic, stereotypes, clich, s, was, a, common, technique, in, textbooks, but, not, on, the, same, page, to, represent, different, eggs, or, embryos, in, 1891, haeckel, made, the, excuse, that, this, extremely, rash, foolishness, had, occurred, in, undue, haste, but, was, bona, fide, and, since, repetition, of, incidental, details, was, obvious, on, close, inspection, it, is, unlikely, to, have, been, intentional, deception, 275, 276, 282, 286, the, revised, 1870, second, edition, of, 1, 500, copies, attracted, more, attention, being, quickly, followed, by, further, revised, editions, with, larger, print, runs, as, the, book, became, a, prominent, part, of, the, optimistic, nationalist, anticlerical, culture, of, progress, in, otto, von, bismarck, s, new, german, empire, the, similarity, of, early, vertebrate, embryos, became, common, knowledge, and, the, illustrations, were, praised, by, experts, such, as, michael, foster, of, the, university, of, cambridge, in, the, introduction, to, his, 1871, the, descent, of, man, and, selection, in, relation, to, sex, darwin, gave, particular, praise, to, haeckel, writing, that, if, nat, rliche, sch, pfungsgeschichte, had, appeared, before, my, essay, had, been, written, i, should, probably, never, have, completed, it, the, first, chapter, included, an, illustration, as, some, of, my, readers, may, never, have, seen, a, drawing, of, an, embryo, i, have, given, one, of, man, and, another, of, a, dog, at, about, the, same, early, stage, of, development, carefully, copied, from, two, works, of, undoubted, accuracy, with, a, footnote, citing, the, sources, and, noting, that, h, ckel, has, also, given, analogous, drawings, in, his, sch, pfungsgeschichte, the, fifth, edition, of, haeckel, s, book, appeared, in, 1874, with, its, frontispiece, a, heroic, portrait, of, haeckel, himself, replacing, the, previous, controversial, image, of, the, heads, of, apes, and, humans, 285, 288, later, in, 1874, haeckel, s, simplified, embryology, textbook, anthropogenie, made, the, subject, into, a, battleground, over, darwinism, aligned, with, bismarck, s, kulturkampf, culture, struggle, against, the, catholic, church, haeckel, took, particular, care, over, the, illustrations, changing, to, the, leading, zoological, publisher, wilhelm, engelmann, of, leipzig, and, obtaining, from, them, use, of, illustrations, from, their, other, textbooks, as, well, as, preparing, his, own, drawings, including, a, dramatic, double, page, illustration, showing, early, somewhat, later, and, still, later, stages, of, 8, different, vertebrates, though, haeckel, s, views, had, attracted, continuing, controversy, there, had, been, little, dispute, about, the, embryos, and, he, had, many, expert, supporters, but, wilhelm, his, revived, the, earlier, criticisms, and, introduced, new, attacks, on, the, 1874, illustrations, others, joined, in, both, expert, anatomists, and, catholic, priests, and, supporters, were, politically, opposed, to, haeckel, s, views, 288, 296, while, it, has, been, widely, claimed, that, haeckel, was, charged, with, fraud, by, five, professors, and, convicted, by, a, university, court, at, jena, there, does, not, appear, to, be, an, independently, verifiable, source, for, this, claim, recent, analyses, richardson, 1998, richardson, and, keuck, 2002, have, found, that, some, of, the, criticisms, of, haeckel, s, embryo, drawings, were, legitimate, but, others, were, unfounded, there, were, multiple, versions, of, the, embryo, drawings, and, haeckel, rejected, the, claims, of, fraud, it, was, later, said, that, there, is, evidence, of, sleight, of, hand, on, both, sides, of, the, feud, between, haeckel, and, wilhelm, his, robert, j, richards, in, a, paper, published, in, 2008, defends, the, case, for, haeckel, shedding, doubt, against, the, fraud, accusations, based, on, the, material, used, for, comparison, with, what, haeckel, could, access, at, the, time, haeckel, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1885, he, was, awarded, the, title, of, excellency, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, in, 1907, and, the, linnean, society, of, london, s, prestigious, darwin, wallace, medal, in, 1908, in, the, united, states, mount, haeckel, a, 13, 418, ft, 4, 090, m, summit, in, the, eastern, sierra, nevada,

is, remembered, with, a, monument, at, herrenberg, erected, in, 1969, an, exhibition, at, ernst, haeckel, haus, and, at, the, jena, phyletic, museum, which, continues, to, teach, about, evolution, and, share, his, work, to, this, day, the, ratfish, harriotta, haeckeli, is, named, in, his, honor, the, research, vessel, ernst, haeckel, is, named, in, his, honor, in, 1981, a, botanical, journal, called, ernstia, was, started, being, published, in, the, city, of, maracay, venezuela, in, 2013, ernstia, a, genus, of, calcareous, sponges, in, the, family, clathrinidae, the, genus, was, erected, to, contain, five, species, previously, assigned, to, clathrina, the, genus, name, honors, ernst, haeckel, for, his, contributions, towards, sponge, taxonomy, and, phylogeny, darwin, s, 1859, book, on, the, origin, of, species, had, immense, popular, influence, but, although, its, sales, exceeded, its, publisher, s, hopes, it, was, a, technical, book, rather, than, a, work, of, popular, science, long, difficult, and, with, few, illustrations, one, of, haeckel, s, books, did, a, great, deal, to, explain, his, version, of, darwinism, to, the, world, it, was, a, bestselling, provocatively, illustrated, book, in, german, titled, nat, rliche, sch, pfungsgeschichte, published, in, berlin, in, 1868, and, translated, into, english, as, the, history, of, creation, in, 1876, until, 1909, eleven, editions, had, appeared, as, well, as, 25, translations, into, other, languages, the, nat, rliche, sch, pfungsgeschichte, cemented, haeckel, s, reputation, as, one, of, germany, s, most, forceful, popularizers, of, science, his, weltr, thsel, were, reprinted, ten, times, after, the, book, s, first, publication, in, 1899, ultimately, over, 400, 000, copies, were, sold, haeckel, argued, that, human, evolution, consisted, of, precisely, 22, phases, the, 21st, the, missing, link, being, a, halfway, step, between, apes, and, humans, he, even, formally, named, this, missing, link, pithecanthropus, alalus, translated, as, ape, man, without, speech, haeckel, s, literary, output, was, extensive, including, many, books, scientific, papers, and, illustrations, for, a, fuller, list, of, works, of, and, about, haeckel, see, his, entry, in, the, german, wikisource, some, historians, have, seen, haeckel, s, social, darwinism, as, a, forerunner, to, nazi, ideology, others, have, denied, the, relationship, altogether, the, evidence, is, in, some, respects, ambiguous, on, one, hand, haeckel, was, an, advocate, of, scientific, racism, he, held, that, evolutionary, biology, had, definitively, proven, that, races, were, unequal, in, intelligence, and, ability, and, that, their, lives, were, also, of, unequal, value, e, g, these, lower, races, such, as, the, veddahs, or, australian, negroes, are, psychologically, nearer, to, the, mammals, apes, or, dogs, than, to, civilised, europeans, we, must, therefore, assign, a, totally, different, value, to, their, lives, as, a, result, of, the, struggle, for, existence, it, followed, that, the, lower, races, would, eventually, be, exterminated, he, was, also, a, social, darwinist, who, believed, that, survival, of, the, fittest, was, a, natural, law, and, that, struggle, led, to, improvement, of, the, race, as, an, advocate, of, eugenics, he, also, believed, that, about, 200, 000, mentally, and, congenitally, ill, should, be, killed, by, a, medical, control, board, this, idea, was, later, put, into, practice, by, nazi, germany, as, part, of, the, aktion, t4, program, alfred, ploetz, founder, of, the, german, society, for, racial, hygiene, praised, haeckel, repeatedly, and, invited, him, to, become, an, honorary, member, haeckel, accepted, the, invitation, haeckel, also, believed, that, germany, should, be, governed, by, an, authoritarian, political, system, and, that, inequalities, both, within, and, between, societies, were, an, inevitable, product, of, evolutionary, law, haeckel, was, also, an, extreme, german, nationalist, who, believed, strongly, in, the, superiority, of, german, culture, on, the, other, hand, haeckel, was, not, an, anti, semite, in, the, racial, hierarchies, he, constructed, jews, tended, to, appear, closer, to, the, top, rather, than, closer, to, the, bottom, as, in, nazi, racial, thought, he, was, also, a, pacifist, until, the, first, world, war, when, he, wrote, propaganda, in, favor, of, the, war, the, principal, arguments, of, historians, who, deny, a, meaningful, connection, between, haeckel, and, nazism, are, that, haeckel, s, ideas, were, very, common, at, the, time, that, nazis, were, much, more, strongly, influenced, by, other, thinkers, and, that, haeckel, is, properly, classified, as, a, 19th, century, german, liberal, rather, than, a, forerunner, to, nazism, they, also, point, to, incompatibilities, between, evolutionary, biology, and, nazi, ideology, nazis, themselves, divided, on, the, question, of, whether, haeckel, should, be, counted, as, a, pioneer, of, their, ideology, ss, captain, and, biologist, heinz, br, cher, wrote, a, biography, of, haeckel, in, 1936, in, which, he, praised, haeckel, as, a, pioneer, in, biological, state, thinking, this, opinion, was, also, shared, by, the, scholarly, journal, der, biologe, which, celebrated, haeckel, s, 100th, birthday, in, 1934, with, several, essays, acclaiming, him, as, a, pioneering, thinker, of, nazism, other, nazis, kept, their, distance, from, haeckel, nazi, propaganda, guidelines, issued, in, 1935, listed, books, which, popularized, darwin, and, evolution, on, an, expunged, list, haeckel, was, included, by, name, as, a, forbidden, author, gunther, hecht, a, member, of, the, nazi, department, of, race, politics, also, issued, a, memorandum, rejecting, haeckel, as, a, forerunner, of, nazism, kurt, hildebrandt, a, nazi, political, philosopher, also, rejected, haeckel, eventually, haeckel, was, rejected, by, nazi, bureaucrats
