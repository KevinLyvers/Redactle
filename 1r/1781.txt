pierre, de, fermat, french, between, 31, october, and, 6, december, 1607, 12, january, 1665, was, a, french, mathematician, who, is, given, credit, for, early, developments, that, led, to, infinitesimal, calculus, including, his, technique, of, adequality, in, particular, he, is, recognized, for, his, discovery, of, an, original, method, of, finding, the, greatest, and, the, smallest, ordinates, of, curved, lines, which, is, analogous, to, that, of, differential, calculus, then, unknown, and, his, research, into, number, theory, he, made, notable, contributions, to, analytic, geometry, probability, and, optics, he, is, best, known, for, his, fermat, s, principle, for, light, propagation, and, his, fermat, s, last, theorem, in, number, theory, which, he, described, in, a, note, at, the, margin, of, a, copy, of, diophantus, arithmetica, he, was, also, a, lawyer, at, the, parlement, of, toulouse, france, fermat, was, born, in, 1607, in, beaumont, de, lomagne, france, the, late, 15th, century, mansion, where, fermat, was, born, is, now, a, museum, he, was, from, gascony, where, his, father, dominique, fermat, was, a, wealthy, leather, merchant, and, served, three, one, year, terms, as, one, of, the, four, consuls, of, beaumont, de, lomagne, his, mother, was, claire, de, long, pierre, had, one, brother, and, two, sisters, and, was, almost, certainly, brought, up, in, the, town, of, his, birth, he, attended, the, university, of, orl, ans, from, 1623, and, received, a, bachelor, in, civil, law, in, 1626, before, moving, to, bordeaux, in, bordeaux, he, began, his, first, serious, mathematical, researches, and, in, 1629, he, gave, a, copy, of, his, restoration, of, apollonius, s, de, locis, planis, to, one, of, the, mathematicians, there, certainly, in, bordeaux, he, was, in, contact, with, beaugrand, and, during, this, time, he, produced, important, work, on, maxima, and, minima, which, he, gave, to, tienne, d, espagnet, who, clearly, shared, mathematical, interests, with, fermat, there, he, became, much, influenced, by, the, work, of, fran, ois, vi, te, in, 1630, he, bought, the, office, of, a, councilor, at, the, parlement, de, toulouse, one, of, the, high, courts, of, judicature, in, france, and, was, sworn, in, by, the, grand, chambre, in, may, 1631, he, held, this, office, for, the, rest, of, his, life, fermat, thereby, became, entitled, to, change, his, name, from, pierre, fermat, to, pierre, de, fermat, on, 1, june, 1631, fermat, married, louise, de, long, a, fourth, cousin, of, his, mother, claire, de, fermat, n, e, de, long, the, fermats, had, eight, children, five, of, whom, survived, to, adulthood, cl, ment, samuel, jean, claire, catherine, and, louise, fluent, in, six, languages, french, latin, occitan, classical, greek, italian, and, spanish, fermat, was, praised, for, his, written, verse, in, several, languages, and, his, advice, was, eagerly, sought, regarding, the, emendation, of, greek, texts, he, communicated, most, of, his, work, in, letters, to, friends, often, with, little, or, no, proof, of, his, theorems, in, some, of, these, letters, to, his, friends, he, explored, many, of, the, fundamental, ideas, of, calculus, before, newton, or, leibniz, fermat, was, a, trained, lawyer, making, mathematics, more, of, a, hobby, than, a, profession, nevertheless, he, made, important, contributions, to, analytical, geometry, probability, number, theory, and, calculus, secrecy, was, common, in, european, mathematical, circles, at, the, time, this, naturally, led, to, priority, disputes, with, contemporaries, such, as, descartes, and, wallis, anders, hald, writes, that, the, basis, of, fermat, s, mathematics, was, the, classical, greek, treatises, combined, with, vieta, s, new, algebraic, methods, fermat, s, pioneering, work, in, analytic, geometry, methodus, ad, disquirendam, maximam, et, minimam, et, de, tangentibus, linearum, curvarum, was, circulated, in, manuscript, form, in, 1636, based, on, results, achieved, in, 1629, predating, the, publication, of, descartes, la, g, om, trie, 1637, which, exploited, the, work, this, manuscript, was, published, posthumously, in, 1679, in, varia, opera, mathematica, as, ad, locos, planos, et, solidos, isagoge, introduction, to, plane, and, solid, loci, in, methodus, ad, disquirendam, maximam, et, minimam, et, de, tangentibus, linearum, curvarum, fermat, developed, a, method, adequality, for, determining, maxima, minima, and, tangents, to, various, curves, that, was, equivalent, to, differential, calculus, in, these, works, fermat, obtained, a, technique, for, finding, the, centers, of, gravity, of, various, plane, and, solid, figures, which, led, to, his, further, work, in, quadrature, fermat, was, the, first, person, known, to, have, evaluated, the, integral, of, general, power, functions, with, his, method, he, was, able, to, reduce, this, evaluation, to, the, sum, of, geometric, series, the, resulting, formula, was, helpful, to, newton, and, then, leibniz, when, they, independently, developed, the, fundamental, theorem, of, calculus, in, number, theory, fermat, studied, pell, s, equation, perfect, numbers, amicable, numbers, and, what, would, later, become, fermat, numbers, it, was, while, researching, perfect, numbers, that, he, discovered, fermat, s, little, theorem, he, invented, a, factorization, method, fermat, s, factorization, method, and, popularized, the, proof, by, infinite, descent, which, he, used, to, prove, fermat, s, right, triangle, theorem, which, includes, as, a, corollary, fermat, s, last, theorem, for, the, case, n, 4, fermat, developed, the, two, square, theorem, and, the, polygonal, number, theorem, which, states, that, each, number, is, a, sum, of, three, triangular, numbers, four, square, numbers, five, pentagonal, numbers, and, so, on, although, fermat, claimed, to, have, proven, all, his, arithmetic, theorems, few, records, of, his, proofs, have, survived, many, mathematicians, including, gauss, doubted, several, of, his, claims, especially, given, the, difficulty, of, some, of, the, problems, and, the, limited, mathematical, methods, available, to, fermat, his, last, theorem, was, first, discovered, by, his, son, in, the, margin, in, his, father, s, copy, of, an, edition, of, diophantus, and, included, the, statement, that, the, margin, was, too, small, to, include, the, proof, it, seems, that, he, had, not, written, to, marin, mersenne, about, it, it, was, first, proven, in, 1994, by, sir, andrew, wiles, using, techniques, unavailable, to, fermat, through, their, correspondence, in, 1654, fermat, and, blaise, pascal, helped, lay, the, foundation, for, the, theory, of, probability, from, this, brief, but, productive, collaboration, on, the, problem, of, points, they, are, now, regarded, as, joint, founders, of, probability, theory, fermat, is, credited, with, carrying, out, the, first, ever, rigorous, probability, calculation, in, it, he, was, asked, by, a, professional, gambler, why, if, he, bet, on, rolling, at, least, one, six, in, four, throws, of, a, die, he, won, in, the, long, term, whereas, betting, on, throwing, at, least, one, double, six, in, 24, throws, of, two, dice, resulted, in, his, losing, fermat, showed, mathematically, why, this, was, the, case, the, first, variational, principle, in, physics, was, articulated, by, euclid, in, his, catoptrica, it, says, that, for, the, path, of, light, reflecting, from, a, mirror, the, angle, of, incidence, equals, the, angle, of, reflection, hero, of, alexandria, later, showed, that, this, path, gave, the, shortest, length, and, the, least, time, fermat, refined, and, generalized, this, to, light, travels, between, two, given, points, along, the, path, of, shortest, time, now, known, as, the, principle, of, least, time, for, this, fermat, is, recognized, as, a, key, figure, in, the, historical, development, of, the, fundamental, principle, of, least, action, in, physics, the, terms, fermat, s, principle, and, fermat, functional, were, named, in, recognition, of, this, role, pierre, de, fermat, died, on, january, 12, 1665, at, castres, in, the, present, day, department, of, tarn, the, oldest, and, most, prestigious, high, school, in, toulouse, is, named, after, him, the, lyc, e, pierre, de, fermat, french, sculptor, th, ophile, barrau, made, a, marble, statue, named, hommage, pierre, fermat, as, a, tribute, to, fermat, now, at, the, capitole, de, toulouse, together, with, ren, descartes, fermat, was, one, of, the, two, leading, mathematicians, of, the, first, half, of, the, 17th, century, according, to, peter, l, bernstein, in, his, 1996, book, against, the, gods, fermat, was, a, mathematician, of, rare, power, he, was, an, independent, inventor, of, analytic, geometry, he, contributed, to, the, early, development, of, calculus, he, did, research, on, the, weight, of, the, earth, and, he, worked, on, light, refraction, and, optics, in, the, course, of, what, turned, out, to, be, an, extended, correspondence, with, blaise, pascal, he, made, a, significant, contribution, to, the, theory, of, probability, but, fermat, s, crowning, achievement, was, in, the, theory, of, numbers, regarding, fermat, s, work, in, analysis, isaac, newton, wrote, that, his, own, early, ideas, about, calculus, came, directly, from, fermat, s, way, of, drawing, tangents, of, fermat, s, number, theoretic, work, the, 20th, century, mathematician, andr, weil, wrote, that, what, we, possess, of, his, methods, for, dealing, with, curves, of, genus, 1, is, remarkably, coherent, it, is, still, the, foundation, for, the, modern, theory, of, such, curves, it, naturally, falls, into, two, parts, the, first, one, may, conveniently, be, termed, a, method, of, ascent, in, contrast, with, the, descent, which, is, rightly, regarded, as, fermat, s, own, regarding, fermat, s, use, of, ascent, weil, continued, the, novelty, consisted, in, the, vastly, extended, use, which, fermat, made, of, it, giving, him, at, least, a, partial, equivalent, of, what, we, would, obtain, by, the, systematic, use, of, the, group, theoretical, properties, of, the, rational, points, on, a, standard, cubic, with, his, gift, for, number, relations, and, his, ability, to, find, proofs, for, many, of, his, theorems, fermat, essentially, created, the, modern, theory, of, numbers
