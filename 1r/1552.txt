of, both, spanish, and, nahua, heritage, although, it, is, not, known, conclusively, whether, zapata, himself, spoke, nahuatl, historian, miguel, le, n, portilla, has, cited, later, zapatista, proclamations, and, eyewitness, accounts, to, argue, that, he, was, fluent, in, the, language, gabriel, zapata, was, a, farmer, and, horse, trainer, and, emiliano, s, upbringing, on, the, farm, gave, him, an, intimate, familiarity, with, the, difficulties, of, the, countryside, and, his, village, s, long, struggle, to, regain, the, land, taken, by, expanding, haciendas, he, received, a, limited, education, from, his, teacher, emilio, vara, but, it, included, the, rudiments, of, bookkeeping, gabriel, died, when, emiliano, was, about, 16, or, 17, leaving, the, latter, to, care, for, his,

century, anenecuilco, was, a, mixed, spanish, speaking, mestizo, and, indigenous, nahuatl, speaking, town, it, had, a, long, history, of, protesting, the, local, haciendas, taking, community, members, land, and, its, leaders, gathered, colonial, era, documentation, of, their, land, titles, to, prove, their, claims, some, of, the, colonial, documentation, was, in, nahuatl, with, contemporary, translations, to, spanish, for, use, in, legal, cases, in, the, spanish, courts, as, referenced, above, one, eyewitness, account, by, luz, jim, nez, of, milpa, alta, states, that, emiliano, zapata, spoke, nahuatl, fluently, when, his, forces, arrived, in, her, community, community, members, in, anenecuilco, including, zapata, sought, redress, against, land, seizures, in, 1892, a, delegation, had, an, audience, with, d, az, who, with, the, intervention, of, a, lawyer, agreed, to, hear, them, although, promising, them, to, deal, favorably, with, their, petition, d, az, had, them, arrested, and, zapata, was, conscripted, into, the, federal, army, under, d, az, conscription, into, the, federal, army, was, much, feared, by, ordinary, mexican, men, and, their, families, zapata, was, one, of, many, rebel, leaders, who, were, conscripted, at, some, point, in, 1909, an, important, meeting, was, called, by, the, elders, of, anenecuilco, whose, chief, elder, was, jos, merino, he, announced, my, intention, to, resign, from, my, position, due, to, my, old, age, and, limited, abilities, to, continue, the, fight, for, the, land, rights, of, the, village, the, meeting, was, used, as, a, time, for, discussion, and, nomination, of, individuals, as, a, replacement, for, merino, as, the, president, of, the, village, council, the, elders, on, the, council, were, so, well, respected, by, the, village, men, that, no, one, would, dare, to, override, their, nominations, or, vote, for, an, individual, against, the, advice, of, the, current, council, at, that, time, the, nominations, made, were, modesto, gonz, lez, bartolo, parral, and, emiliano, zapata, after, the, nominations, were, closed, a, vote, was, taken, and, zapata, became, the, new, council, president, without, contest, although, zapata, had, turned, 30, only, a, month, before, voters, knew, that, it, was, necessary, to, elect, someone, respected, by, the, community, who, would, be, responsible, for, the, village, even, though, he, was, relatively, young, anenecuilco, was, ready, to, hand, over, the, leadership, to, him, without, any, worry, of, failure, before, he, was, elected, he, had, shown, the, village, his, nature, by, helping, to, lead, a, campaign, in, opposition, to, the, candidate, d, az, had, chosen, governor, even, though, zapata, s, efforts, failed, he, was, able, to, create, and, cultivate, relationships, with, political, authority, figures, that, would, prove, useful, for, him, zapata, became, a, leading, figure, in, the, village, of, anenecuilco, where, his, family, had, lived, for, many, generations, though, he, did, not, take, the, title, of, don, as, was, custom, for, someone, of, his, status, instead, the, anenecuilcans, referred, to, zapata, affectionately, as, miliano, and, later, as, pobrecito, poor, little, thing, after, his, death, the, flawed, 1910, elections, were, a, major, reason, for, the, outbreak, of, the, mexican, revolution, in, 1910, porfirio, d, az, was, being, threatened, by, the, candidacy, of, francisco, i, madero, zapata, seeing, an, opportunity, to, promote, land, reform, in, mexico, joined, with, madero, and, his, constitutionalists, who, included, pascual, orozco, and, pancho, villa, whom, he, perceived, to, be, the, best, chance, for, genuine, change, in, the, country, although, he, was, wary, of, madero, zapata, cooperated, with, him, when, madero, made, vague, promises, about, land, reform, in, his, plan, of, san, luis, potos, land, reform, was, the, central, feature, of, zapata, s, political, vision, zapata, joined, madero, s, campaign, against, president, d, az, the, first, military, campaign, of, zapata, was, the, capture, of, the, hacienda, of, chinameca, when, zapata, s, army, captured, cuautla, after, a, six, day, battle, on, may, 19, 1911, it, became, clear, that, d, az, would, not, hold, on, to, power, for, long, during, his, interim, presidency, francisco, le, n, de, la, barra, tasked, general, victoriano, huerta, to, suppress, revolutionaries, in, morelos, huerta, was, to, disarm, revolutionaries, peacefully, if, possible, but, could, use, force, in, august, 1911, huerta, led, 1, 000, federal, troops, to, cuernavaca, which, madero, saw, as, provocative, writing, the, minister, of, the, interior, zapata, demanded, the, federal, troops, withdraw, from, morelos, saying, i, won, t, be, responsible, for, the, blood, that, is, going, to, flow, if, the, federal, forces, remain, although, madero, s, plan, of, san, luis, potos, specified, the, return, of, village, land, and, won, the, support, of, peasants, seeking, land, reform, he, was, not, ready, to, implement, radical, change, madero, simply, demanded, that, public, servants, act, morally, in, enforcing, the, law, upon, seeing, the, response, by, villagers, madero, offered, formal, justice, in, courts, to, individuals, who, had, been, wronged, by, others, with, regard, to, agrarian, politics, zapata, decided, that, on, the, surface, it, seemed, as, though, madero, was, doing, good, things, for, the, people, of, mexico, but, zapata, did, not, know, the, level, of, sincerity, in, madero, s, actions, and, thus, did, not, know, if, he, should, support, him, completely, compromises, between, the, madero, and, zapata, failed, in, november, 1911, days, after, madero, was, elected, president, zapata, and, otilio, monta, o, s, nchez, a, former, school, teacher, fled, to, the, mountains, of, southwest, puebla, there, they, promulgated, the, most, radical, reform, plan, in, mexico, the, plan, de, ayala, plan, of, ayala, the, plan, declared, madero, a, traitor, named, as, head, of, the, revolution, pascual, orozco, the, victorious, general, who, captured, ciudad, ju, rez, in, 1911, forcing, the, resignation, of, d, az, he, outlined, a, plan, for, true, land, reform, zapata, had, supported, the, ouster, of, d, az, and, had, the, expectation, that, madero, would, fulfill, the, promises, made, in, the, plan, of, san, luis, potos, to, return, village, lands, he, did, not, share, madero, s, vision, of, democracy, built, on, particular, freedoms, and, guarantees, that, were, meaningless, to, peasants, freedom, of, the, press, for, those, who, cannot, read, free, elections, for, those, who, do, not, know, the, candidates, proper, legal, for, those, who, have, anything, to, do, with, an, attorney, all, those, democratic, principles, all, those, great, words, that, gave, such, joy, to, our, fathers, and, grandfathers, have, lost, their, magic, for, the, people, with, or, without, elections, with, or, without, an, effective, law, with, the, porfirian, dictatorship, or, with, madero, s, democracy, with, a, controlled, or, free, press, its, fate, remains, the, same, the, 1911, plan, of, ayala, called, for, all, lands, stolen, under, d, az, to, be, immediately, returned, there, had, been, considerable, land, fraud, under, the, old, dictator, so, a, great, deal, of, territory, was, involved, it, also, stated, that, large, plantations, owned, by, a, single, person, or, family, should, have, one, third, of, their, land, nationalized, which, would, then, be, required, to, be, given, to, poor, farmers, it, also, argued, that, if, any, large, plantation, owner, resisted, this, action, they, should, have, the, other, two, thirds, confiscated, as, well, the, plan, of, ayala, also, invoked, the, name, of, president, benito, ju, rez, one, of, mexico, s, great, liberal, leaders, and, compared, the, taking, of, land, from, the, wealthy, to, juarez, s, actions, when, land, was, expropriated, from, the, catholic, church, during, the, liberal, reform, another, part, of, the, plan, stated, that, rural, cooperatives, and, other, measurements, should, be, put, in, place, to, prevent, the, land, from, being, seized, or, stolen, in, the, future, in, the, following, weeks, the, development, of, military, operations, betray, ed, good, evidence, of, clear, and, intelligent, planning, during, orozco, s, rebellion, zapata, fought, mexican, troops, in, the, south, near, mexico, city, in, the, original, design, of, the, armed, force, zapata, was, a, mere, colonel, among, several, others, however, the, true, plan, that, came, about, through, this, organization, lent, itself, to, zapata, zapata, believed, that, the, best, route, of, attack, would, be, to, center, the, fighting, and, action, in, cuautla, if, this, political, location, could, be, overthrown, the, army, would, have, enough, power, to, veto, anyone, else, s, control, of, the, state, negotiate, for, cuernavaca, or, attack, it, directly, and, maintain, independent, access, to, mexico, city, as, well, as, escape, routes, to, the, southern, hills, however, in, order, to, gain, this, great, success, zapata, realized, that, his, men, needed, to, be, better, armed, and, trained, the, first, line, of, action, demanded, that, zapata, and, his, men, control, the, area, behind, and, below, a, line, from, jojutla, to, yecapixtla, when, this, was, accomplished, it, gave, the, army, the, ability, to, complete, raids, as, well, as, wait, as, the, opposition, of, the, federal, army, and, police, detachments, slowly, dissipated, the, army, would, be, able, to, eventually, gain, powerful, control, over, key, locations, on, the, interoceanic, railway, from, puebla, city, to, cuautla, if, these, feats, could, be, completed, it, would, gain, access, to, cuautla, directly, and, the, city, would, fall, the, plan, of, action, was, carried, out, successfully, in, jojutla, however, pablo, torres, burgos, the, commander, of, the, operation, was, disappointed, that, the, army, disobeyed, his, orders, against, looting, and, ransacking, the, army, took, complete, control, of, the, area, and, it, seemed, as, though, torres, burgos, had, lost, control, over, his, forces, prior, to, this, event, shortly, after, torres, burgos, called, a, meeting, and, resigned, from, his, position, upon, leaving, jojutla, with, his, two, sons, he, was, surprised, by, a, federal, police, patrol, who, subsequently, shot, all, three, of, the, men, on, the, spot, this, seemed, to, some, to, be, an, ending, blow, to, the, movement, because, torres, burgos, had, not, selected, a, successor, for, his, position, however, zapata, was, ready, to, take, up, where, torres, burgos, had, left, off, shortly, after, torres, burgos, s, death, a, party, of, rebels, elected, zapata, as, supreme, chief, of, the, revolutionary, movement, of, the, south, this, seemed, to, be, the, fix, to, all, of, the, problems, that, had, just, arisen, but, other, individuals, wanted, to, replace, zapata, as, well, due, to, this, new, conflict, the, individual, who, would, come, out, on, top, would, have, to, do, so, by, convincing, his, peers, he, deserved, their, backing, zapata, finally, gained, the, support, necessary, by, his, peers, and, was, considered, a, singularly, qualified, candidate, this, decision, to, make, zapata, the, leader, of, the, revolution, in, morelos, did, not, occur, all, at, once, nor, did, it, ever, reach, a, true, definitive, level, of, recognition, in, order, to, succeed, zapata, needed, a, strong, financial, backing, for, the, battles, to, come, this, came, in, the, form, of, 10, 000, pesos, delivered, by, rodolfo, from, the, tacubayans, due, to, this, amount, of, money, zapata, s, group, of, rebels, became, one, of, the, strongest, in, the, state, financially, after, a, period, zapata, became, the, leader, of, his, strategic, zone, which, gave, him, power, and, control, over, the, actions, of, many, more, individual, rebel, groups, and, thus, greatly, increased, his, margin, of, success, among, revolutionaries, in, other, districts, of, the, state, however, zapata, s, authority, was, more, tenuous, after, a, meeting, between, zapata, and, ambrosio, figueroa, in, jolalpan, it, was, decided, that, zapata, would, have, joint, power, with, figueroa, with, regard, to, operations, in, morelos, this, was, a, turning, point, in, the, level, of, authority, and, influence, that, zapata, had, gained, and, proved, useful, in, the, direct, overthrow, of, morelos, if, there, was, anyone, that, zapata, hated, more, than, d, az, and, madero, it, was, victoriano, huerta, the, bitter, violent, alcoholic, who, had, been, responsible, for, many, atrocities, in, southern, mexico, while, trying, to, end, the, rebellion, zapata, was, not, alone, in, the, north, pancho, villa, who, had, supported, madero, immediately, took, to, the, field, against, huerta, zapata, revised, the, plan, of, ayala, and, named, himself, the, leader, of, his, revolution, he, was, joined, by, two, newcomers, to, the, revolution, venustiano, carranza, and, alvaro, obreg, n, who, raised, large, armies, in, coahuila, and, sonora, respectively, together, they, made, short, work, of, huerta, who, resigned, and, fled, in, june, 1914, after, repeated, military, losses, on, april, 21, 1914, u, s, president, woodrow, wilson, sent, a, contingent, of, troops, to, occupy, the, port, city, of, veracruz, this, sudden, threat, caused, huerta, to, withdraw, his, troops, from, morelos, and, puebla, leaving, only, jojutla, and, cuernavaca, under, federal, control, zapatistas, quickly, assumed, control, of, eastern, morelos, taking, cuautla, and, jonacatepec, with, no, resistance, in, spite, of, being, faced, with, a, possible, foreign, invasion, zapata, refused, to, unite, with, huerta, in, defense, of, the, nation, he, stated, that, if, need, be, he, would, defend, mexico, alone, as, chief, of, the, ayalan, forces, in, may, the, zapatistas, took, jojutla, from, the, federal, army, many, of, whom, joined, the, rebels, and, captured, guns, and, ammunition, they, also, laid, siege, to, cuernavaca, where, a, small, contingent, of, federal, troops, were, holed, up, by, the, summer, of, 1915, zapata, s, forces, had, taken, the, southern, edge, of, the, federal, district, occupying, milpa, alta, and, xochimilco, and, were, poised, to, move, into, the, capital, in, mid, july, huerta, was, forced, to, flee, as, a, constitutionalist, force, under, carranza, obreg, n, and, villa, took, the, federal, district, the, constitutionalists, established, a, peace, treaty, inserting, carranza, as, first, authority, of, the, nation, carranza, an, aristocrat, with, politically, relevant, connections, then, gained, the, backing, of, the, us, which, passed, over, villa, and, zapata, due, to, their, lower, status, backgrounds, and, more, progressive, ideologies, in, spite, of, having, contributed, decisively, to, the, fall, of, huerta, the, zapatistas, were, left, out, of, the, peace, treaties, probably, because, of, carranza, s, intense, dislike, for, the, zapatistas, whom, he, saw, as, uncultured, savages, through, 1915, there, was, a, tentative, peace, in, morelos, and, the, rest, of, the, country, as, the, constitutionalist, forces, began, to, split, with, villa, creating, a, popular, front, against, carranza, s, constitutionalists, carranza, worked, diplomatically, to, get, the, zapatistas, to, recognize, his, rule, sending, dr, atl, as, an, envoy, to, propose, a, compromise, with, zapata, for, carranza, an, agreement, with, zapata, would, mean, that, he, did, not, need, to, worry, about, his, force, s, southern, flank, and, could, concentrate, on, defeating, villa, zapata, demanded, veto, power, over, carranza, s, decisions, which, carranza, rejected, and, negotiations, broke, off, zapata, issued, a, statement, perhaps, drafted, by, his, advisor, antonio, d, az, soto, y, gama, the, country, wishes, to, destroy, feudalism, once, and, for, all, administrative, reform, complete, honesty, in, the, handling, of, public, monies, freedom, of, the, press, for, those, who, cannot, read, free, elections, for, those, who, do, not, know, the, candidates, proper, legal, proceedings, for, those, who, have, never, had, anything, to, do, with, an, attorney, all, those, beautiful, democratic, principles, all, those, great, words, that, give, such, joy, to, our, fathers, and, grandfathers, have, lost, their, magic, the, people, continue, to, suffer, from, poverty, and, endless, disappointments, unable, to, reach, an, agreement, the, constitutionalists, divided, along, ideological, lines, with, zapata, and, villa, leading, a, progressive, rebellion, and, carranza, and, obreg, n, leading, the, conservative, faction, of, the, remaining, constitutionalists, villa, and, the, other, anti, carrancista, leaders, of, the, north, established, the, convention, of, aguascalientes, against, carranza, zapata, and, his, envoys, got, the, convention, to, adopt, some, of, the, agrarian, principles, of, the, plan, de, ayala, zapata, and, villa, met, in, xochimilco, to, negotiate, an, alliance, and, divide, the, responsibility, for, ridding, mexico, of, the, remaining, carrancistas, the, meeting, was, awkward, but, amiable, and, was, widely, publicized, it, was, decided, that, zapata, should, work, on, securing, the, area, east, of, morelos, from, puebla, towards, veracruz, nonetheless, during, the, ensuing, campaign, in, puebla, zapata, was, disappointed, by, villa, s, lack, of, support, villa, did, not, initially, provide, the, zapatistas, with, the, weaponry, they, had, agreed, on, and, when, he, did, he, did, not, provide, adequate, transportation, there, were, also, a, series, of, abuses, by, villistas, against, zapatista, soldiers, and, chiefs, these, experiences, led, zapata, to, grow, unsatisfied, with, the, alliance, turning, instead, his, efforts, to, reorganizing, the, state, of, morelos, that, had, been, left, in, shambles, by, the, onslaught, of, huerta, and, robles, having, taken, puebla, zapata, left, a, couple, of, garrisons, there, but, did, not, support, villa, further, against, obreg, n, and, carranza, the, carrancistas, saw, that, the, rebel, alliance, was, divided, and, decided, to, concentrate, on, beating, villa, which, left, the, zapatistas, to, their, own, devices, for, a, while, through, 1915, zapata, began, reshaping, morelos, after, the, plan, de, ayala, redistributing, hacienda, lands, to, the, peasants, and, largely, letting, village, councils, run, their, own, local, affairs, most, peasants, did, not, turn, to, cash, crops, instead, growing, subsistence, crops, such, as, corn, beans, and, vegetables, the, result, was, that, as, the, capital, was, starving, while, the, peasants, had, more, to, eat, than, they, had, had, in, 1910, and, at, lower, prices, the, only, official, event, in, morelos, during, this, entire, year, was, a, bullfight, in, which, zapata, himself, and, his, nephew, amador, salazar, participated, 1915, was, a, short, period, of, peace, and, prosperity, for, the, farmers, of, morelos, in, between, the, massacres, of, the, huerta, era, and, the, civil, war, of, the, winners, to, come, even, when, villa, was, retreating, having, lost, the, battle, of, celaya, in, 1915, and, obreg, n, took, the, capital, from, the, conventionists, who, retreated, to, toluca, zapata, did, not, open, a, second, front, when, carranza, s, forces, were, poised, to, move, into, morelos, zapata, took, action, he, attacked, carrancista, positions, with, large, forces, trying, to, harry, the, carrancistas, in, the, rear, as, they, were, occupied, with, routing, villa, throughout, the, northwest, though, zapata, managed, to, take, many, important, sites, such, as, the, necaxa, power, plant, that, supplied, mexico, city, he, was, unable, to, hold, them, the, convention, was, finally, routed, from, toluca, and, carranza, was, recognized, by, us, president, woodrow, wilson, as, the, head, of, state, of, mexico, in, october, through, 1916, zapata, attacked, federal, forces, from, hidalgo, to, oaxaca, and, genovevo, de, la, o, fought, the, carrancistas, in, guerrero, the, zapatistas, attempted, to, amass, support, for, their, cause, by, promulgating, new, manifestos, against, the, hacendados, but, this, had, little, effect, since, the, hacendados, had, already, lost, power, throughout, the, country, having, been, put, in, charge, of, the, efforts, to, root, out, zapatismo, in, morelos, pablo, gonz, lez, garza, was, humiliated, by, zapata, s, counterattacks, and, enforced, increasingly, draconian, measures, against, the, locals, he, received, no, reinforcements, as, obreg, n, the, minister, of, war, needed, all, his, forces, against, villa, in, the, north, and, against, felix, d, az, in, oaxaca, through, low, scale, attacks, on, gonzalez, s, positions, zapata, drove, gonzalez, out, of, morelos, by, the, end, of, 1916, nonetheless, outside, of, morelos, the, revolutionary, forces, started, disbanding, some, rebels, such, as, domingo, arenas, joined, the, constitutionalists, while, others, lapsed, into, banditry, in, morelos, zapata, once, more, reorganized, the, zapatista, state, continuing, with, democratic, reforms, and, legislation, meant, to, keep, the, civil, population, safe, from, abuses, by, soldiers, though, his, advisers, urged, him, to, mount, a, concerted, campaign, against, the, carrancistas, across, southern, mexico, again, he, concentrated, entirely, on, stabilizing, morelos, and, making, life, tolerable, for, the, peasants, meanwhile, carranza, mounted, national, elections, in, all, state, capitals, except, cuernavaca, and, promulgated, the, 1917, constitution, which, incorporated, elements, of, the, plan, de, ayala, meanwhile, the, disintegration, of, the, revolution, outside, of, morelos, put, pressure, on, the, zapatistas, when, arenas, went, over, to, the, constitutionalists, he, secured, peace, for, his, region, and, remained, in, control, there, this, suggested, to, many, revolutionaries, that, perhaps, the, time, had, come, to, seek, a, peaceful, conclusion, to, the, struggle, a, faction, within, the, zapatista, ranks, led, by, former, general, vazquez, and, zapata, s, erstwhile, adviser, and, inspiration, otilio, monta, o, moved, against, the, tlaltizapan, headquarters, demanding, surrender, to, the, carrancistas, reluctantly, zapata, had, monta, o, tried, for, treason, and, executed, zapata, began, looking, for, allies, among, the, northern, revolutionaries, and, the, southern, felicistas, followers, of, the, liberalist, felix, d, az, he, sent, gildardo, maga, a, as, an, envoy, to, communicate, with, the, americans, and, other, possible, sources, of, support, in, the, fall, of, 1917, a, force, led, by, gonzalez, and, ex, zapatista, sidronio, camacho, who, had, killed, zapata, s, brother, eufemio, moved, into, the, eastern, part, of, morelos, taking, cuautla, zacualpan, and, jonacatepec, zapata, continued, to, try, to, unite, the, national, anti, carrancista, movement, through, the, next, year, and, the, constitutionalists, did, not, make, further, advances, in, the, winter, of, 1918, severe, cold, weather, and, the, onset, of, the, spanish, flu, caused, the, loss, of, a, quarter, of, the, total, population, of, the, state, almost, as, many, as, had, been, lost, to, huerta, in, 1914, furthermore, zapata, began, to, worry, that, with, the, end, of, world, war, i, the, us, would, turn, its, attention, to, mexico, forcing, the, zapatistas, either, to, join, the, carrancistas, in, a, national, defense, or, acquiesce, to, foreign, domination, of, mexico, in, december, 1918, carrancistas, under, gonzalez, undertook, an, offensive, campaign, taking, most, of, the, state, of, morelos, and, pushing, zapata, to, retreat, the, main, zapatista, headquarters, was, moved, to, tochimilco, puebla, although, tlaltizapan, also, remained, under, zapatista, control, through, castro, carranza, issued, offers, to, the, main, zapatista, generals, to, join, the, nationalist, cause, with, pardon, but, apart, from, manuel, palafox, who, having, fallen, in, disgrace, among, the, zapatistas, had, joined, the, arenistas, none, of, the, major, generals, did, zapata, released, statements, accusing, carranza, of, being, secretly, sympathetic, to, germany, in, march, zapata, finally, sent, an, open, letter, to, carranza, urging, him, for, the, good, of, the, fatherland, to, resign, his, leadership, to, vazquez, g, mez, by, now, the, rallying, point, of, the, anti, constitutionalist, movement, having, issued, this, formidable, moral, challenge, to, carranza, prior, to, the, upcoming, 1920, presidential, elections, zapata, was, urged, by, zapatista, generals, at, tochimilco, maga, a, and, ayaquica, not, to, take, any, risks, and, lie, low, but, zapata, declined, considering, that, the, respect, of, his, troops, depended, on, his, active, presence, at, the, front, as, far, as, is, known, zapata, fathered, a, total, of, 16, documented, children, with, 9, women, but, it, has, also, been, commented, that, there, were, actually, 14, women, with, whom, he, had, relationships, there, is, a, version, of, the, existence, of, another, son, jos, zapata, of, an, unknown, mother, but, the, validity, of, the, latter, is, not, fully, proven, according, to, the, book, the, album, of, amada, d, az, written, by, ricardo, orozco, and, based, on, the, diaries, of, amada, d, az, daughter, of, porfirio, d, az, zapata, had, a, very, good, friendship, with, ignacio, de, la, torre, y, mier, amada, s, husband, the, friendship, between, the, two, has, been, questioned, over, time, and, it, has, been, said, that, zapata, and, mier, had, an, affair, as, stated, in, the, aforementioned, work, it, is, said, that, both, met, in, 1906, when, the, revolutionary, worked, in, the, stables, of, the, hacienda, de, san, carlos, borromeo, it, was, not, openly, known, but, mier, was, homosexual, so, when, he, met, zapata, he, fell, in, love, with, him, and, decided, to, take, him, to, work, at, his, ranch, located, in, mexico, city, once, there, the, book, cites, that, in, words, written, by, amada, d, az, she, saw, them, wallowing, in, the, stables, some, time, after, this, as, de, la, torre, y, mier, was, a, politician, and, businessman, the, mexican, revolution, represented, a, problem, for, him, this, being, one, of, the, reasons, why, he, would, finance, a, fight, that, would, try, to, eradicate, the, movement, the, efforts, were, useless, since, in, the, end, the, revolution, managed, to, triumph, subsequently, venustiano, carranza, one, of, its, leaders, ordered, mier, s, imprisonment, taking, the, alleged, relationship, he, had, with, zapata, as, a, background, it, has, been, said, that, it, could, have, been, a, kind, of, gay, love, gesture, that, zapata, had, with, him, because, thanks, to, the, intervention, of, the, aforementioned, he, managed, to, be, given, freedom, and, escape, from, imprisonment, with, this, history, it, has, been, concluded, that, he, may, have, been, a, bisexual, man, other, people, who, have, talked, about, this, include, pedro, ngel, palou, as, in, his, novel, zapata, insinuates, that, zapata, had, some, homosexual, relations, the, latter, was, based, on, testimonies, told, by, manuel, palafox, el, ave, negra, who, was, the, trusted, emissary, personal, secretary, and, one, of, the, closest, revolutionaries, to, zapata, who, additionally, was, secretly, gay, zapata, was, aware, of, his, preferences, and, had, no, problems, with, it, but, since, he, was, governed, by, the, principle, of, executing, those, who, were, too, feminine, and, palafox, behaved, in, this, way, little, by, little, the, rumor, about, the, homosexuality, of, his, revolutionary, companion, was, gaining, strength, among, his, troops, and, finally, in, 1918, he, found, it, necessary, to, remove, him, from, his, post, as, general, and, main, zapatista, emissary, eliminating, zapata, was, a, top, priority, for, president, carranza, carranza, was, unwilling, to, compromise, with, domestic, foes, and, wanted, to, demonstrate, to, mexican, elites, and, to, american, interests, that, carranza, was, the, only, viable, alternative, to, both, anarchy, and, radicalism, in, mid, march, 1919, general, pablo, gonz, lez, ordered, his, subordinate, jes, s, guajardo, to, begin, operations, against, the, zapatistas, in, the, mountains, around, huautla, but, when, gonz, lez, later, discovered, guajardo, carousing, in, a, cantina, he, had, him, arrested, and, a, public, scandal, ensued, on, march, 21, zapata, attempted, to, smuggle, in, a, note, to, guajardo, inviting, him, to, switch, sides, the, note, however, never, reached, guajardo, but, instead, wound, up, on, gonz, lez, s, desk, gonz, lez, devised, a, plan, to, use, this, note, to, his, advantage, he, accused, guajardo, of, not, only, being, a, drunk, but, of, being, a, traitor, after, reducing, guajardo, to, tears, gonz, lez, explained, to, him, that, he, could, recover, from, this, disgrace, if, he, feigned, a, defection, to, zapata, so, guajardo, wrote, to, zapata, telling, him, that, he, would, bring, over, his, men, and, supplies, if, certain, guarantees, were, promised, zapata, answered, guajardo, s, letter, on, april, 1, 1919, agreeing, to, all, of, guajardo, s, terms, zapata, suggested, a, mutiny, on, april, 4, guajardo, replied, that, his, defection, should, wait, until, a, new, shipment, of, arms, and, ammunition, arrived, sometime, between, the, 6th, and, the, 10th, by, the, 7th, the, plans, were, set, zapata, ordered, guajardo, to, attack, the, federal, garrison, at, jonacatepec, because, the, garrison, included, troops, who, had, defected, from, zapata, pablo, gonz, lez, and, guajardo, notified, the, jonacatepec, garrison, ahead, of, time, and, a, mock, battle, was, staged, on, april, 9, at, the, conclusion, of, the, mock, battle, the, former, zapatistas, were, arrested, and, shot, convinced, that, guajardo, was, sincere, zapata, agreed, to, a, final, meeting, where, guajardo, would, defect, on, april, 10, 1919, guajardo, invited, zapata, to, a, meeting, intimating, that, he, intended, to, defect, to, the, revolutionaries, however, when, zapata, arrived, at, the, hacienda, de, san, juan, in, chinameca, ayala, municipality, guajardo, s, men, riddled, him, with, bullets, zapata, s, body, was, photographed, displayed, for, 24, hours, and, then, buried, in, cuautla, pablo, gonz, lez, wanted, the, body, photographed, so, that, there, would, be, no, doubt, that, zapata, was, dead, it, was, an, actual, fact, that, the, famous, jefe, of, the, southern, region, had, died, although, mexico, city, newspapers, had, called, for, zapata, s, body, to, be, brought, to, the, capital, carranza, did, not, do, so, however, zapata, s, clothing, was, displayed, outside, a, newspaper, s, office, across, from, the, alameda, park, in, the, capital, although, zapata, s, assassination, weakened, his, forces, in, morelos, the, zapatistas, continued, the, fight, against, carranza, for, carranza, the, death, of, zapata, was, the, removal, of, an, ongoing, threat, for, many, zapata, s, assassination, undermined, worker, and, peasant, support, for, carranza, and, pablo, gonz, lez, obreg, n, seized, on, the, opportunity, to, attack, carranza, and, gonz, lez, obreg, n, s, rival, candidate, for, the, presidency, by, saying, this, crime, reveals, a, lack, of, ethics, in, some, members, of, the, government, and, also, of, political, sense, since, peasant, votes, in, the, upcoming, election, will, now, go, to, whoever, runs, against, pablo, gonz, lez, in, spite, of, gonz, lez, s, attempts, to, sully, the, name, of, zapata, and, the, plan, de, ayala, during, his, 1920, campaign, for, the, presidency, the, people, of, morelos, continued, to, support, zapatista, generals, providing, them, with, weapons, supplies, and, protection, carranza, was, wary, of, the, threat, of, u, s, intervention, and, zapatista, generals, decided, to, take, a, conciliatory, approach, bands, of, zapatistas, started, surrendering, in, exchange, for, amnesties, and, many, zapatista, generals, went, on, to, become, local, authorities, such, as, fortino, ayaquica, who, became, municipal, president, of, tochimilco, other, generals, such, as, genovevo, de, la, o, remained, active, in, small, scale, guerrilla, warfare, as, venustiano, carranza, moved, to, curb, his, former, allies, and, now, rivals, in, 1920, to, impose, a, civilian, ignacio, bonillas, as, his, successor, in, the, presidency, obreg, n, sought, to, align, himself, with, the, zapatista, movement, against, that, of, carranza, genovevo, de, la, o, and, maga, a, supported, him, in, the, coup, by, former, constitutionalists, fighting, in, morelos, against, carranza, and, helping, prompt, carranza, to, flee, mexico, city, toward, veracruz, in, may, 1920, obreg, n, and, genovevo, de, la, o, entered, mexico, city, in, triumph, zapatistas, were, given, important, posts, in, the, interim, government, of, adolfo, de, la, huerta, and, the, administration, of, lvaro, obreg, n, following, his, election, to, the, presidency, after, the, coup, zapatistas, had, almost, total, control, of, the, state, of, morelos, where, they, carried, out, a, program, of, agrarian, reform, and, land, redistribution, based, on, the, provisions, of, the, plan, de, ayala, and, with, the, support, of, the, government, according, to, la, dem, crata, after, zapata, s, assassination, in, the, consciousness, of, the, natives, zapata, had, taken, on, the, proportions, of, a, myth, because, he, had, given, them, a, formula, of, vindication, against, old, offenses, mythmaking, would, continue, for, decades, after, zapata, was, gunned, down, zapata, s, influence, continues, to, this, day, particularly, in, revolutionary, tendencies, in, southern, mexico, in, the, long, run, he, has, done, more, for, his, ideals, in, death, than, he, did, in, life, he, came, to, be, viewed, as, a, martyr, to, the, cause, of, land, reform, after, his, murder, even, though, mexico, still, has, not, implemented, the, sort, of, land, reform, he, wanted, he, is, remembered, as, a, visionary, who, fought, for, his, countrymen, zapata, s, plan, of, ayala, influenced, article, 27, of, the, progressive, 1917, constitution, of, mexico, that, codified, an, agrarian, reform, program, even, though, the, mexican, revolution, did, restore, some, land, that, had, been, taken, under, d, az, the, land, reform, on, the, scale, imagined, by, zapata, was, never, enacted, however, a, great, deal, of, the, significant, land, distribution, which, zapata, sought, would, later, be, enacted, after, mexican, president, l, zaro, c, rdenas, took, office, in, 1934, c, rdenas, would, fulfill, not, only, the, land, distribution, policies, written, in, article, 27, but, other, reforms, written, in, the, mexican, constitution, as, well, there, are, controversies, about, the, portrayal, of, emiliano, zapata, and, his, followers, whether, they, were, bandits, or, revolutionaries, at, the, outbreak, of, the, revolution, zapata, s, agrarian, revolt, was, soon, construed, as, a, caste, war, in, which, members, of, an, inferior, race, were, captained, by, a, modern, attila, zapata, is, now, one, of, the, most, revered, national, heroes, of, mexico, to, many, mexicans, especially, the, peasant, and, indigenous, citizens, zapata, was, a, practical, revolutionary, who, sought, the, implementation, of, liberties, and, agrarian, rights, outlined, in, the, plan, of, ayala, he, was, a, realist, with, the, goal, of, achieving, political, and, economic, emancipation, of, the, peasants, in, southern, mexico, and, leading, them, out, of, severe, poverty, many, popular, organizations, take, their, name, from, zapata, most, notably, the, zapatista, army, of, national, liberation, ej, rcito, zapatista, de, liberaci, n, nacional,

chiapas, towns, streets, and, housing, developments, called, emiliano, zapata, are, common, across, the, country, and, he, has, at, times, been, depicted, on, mexican, banknotes, according, to, eric, wolf, zapata, and, his, movement, have, also, been, credited, with, contributing, towards, christian, socialism, and, liberation, theology, zapata, and, his, agrarian, revolutionaries, fought, under, the, emblem, of, virgin, of, guadalupe, which, highlighted, the, catholic, nature, of, the, movement, unlike, the, constitutionalists, and, obregonistas, zapata, s, revolutionary, faction, was, considered, friendly, towards, the, catholic, church, as, the, followers, of, zapata, were, committed, catholics, and, were, known, for, tucking, pictures, of, virgin, mary, into, their, hats, for, protection, many, cristeros, strongly, admired, zapata, during, the, cristero, war, damariz, posadas, named, zapatismo, an, example, of, a, marian, movement, being, shaped, by, liberation, theology, noting, the, connection, between, the, zapatist, marian, message, that, the, natives, as, the, chosen, people, and, the, central, concept, of, liberation, theology, the, preferential, option, for, the, poor, zapata, recognized, the, indigenous, as, the, poor, of, m, xico, and, promoted, a, culture, of, a, revolution, against, poverty, the, neo, zapatistas, that, followed, the, legacy, of, zapata, kept, the, marian, roots, of, his, movement, and, the, catholic, church, became, politically, involved, with, the, neo, zapatistas, in, the, 1960s, further, shaping, their, ideology, one, zapatista, fighter, remarked, we, all, wanted, change, we, prayed, it, helped, but, it, did, not, solve, anything, the, church, helps, us, fight, yes, we, use, weapons, but, not, always, right, now, we, focus, on, changing, the, government, and, changing, the, laws, to, help, people, zapata, left, a, profound, influence, on, mexican, natives, and, his, movement, became, a, defining, feature, of, the, morelense, culture, his, agrarian, struggle, has, a, primary, role, in, the, collective, memory, of, morelos, and, local, religious, festivals, incorporate, him, on, an, almost, equal, level, with, saint, zapata, s, ventures, were, attributed, to, the, intervention, from, patron, saints, and, zapatista, veterans, became, the, secular, complement, of, local, cult, of, saints, as, they, became, both, symbols, of, the, ideals, the, wishes, of, the, group, in, other, regions, such, as, chiapas, and, tepoztl, n, zapata, is, also, worshipped, as, a, reincarnated, mayan, deity, vot, n,
