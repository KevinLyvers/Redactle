choice, of, the, course, of, railways, even, before, germany, began, constructing, its, first, railroad, he, had, noticed, their, military, potential, and, he, urged, the, general, staff, to, support, railway, construction, for, mobilisation, and, supply, he, spent, all, of, his, savings, on, investments, into, prussian, railroad, ventures, which, made, him, a, considerable, amount, of, wealth, during, his, later, years, in, the, great, general, staff, he, would, add, a, railways, department, which, did, not, have, the, task, of, planning, military, campaigns, like, many, of, the, other, departments, but, managed, the, military, use, of, railways, in, 1845, moltke, published, the, russo, turkish, campaign, in, europe, 1828, 1829, which, was, well, received, in, military, circles, in,

years, though, after, the, establishment, of, the, german, empire, the, prussian, general, staff, s, title, was, changed, to, great, general, staff, as, it, would, have, direction, of, the, various, german, armies, during, war, as, soon, as, he, gained, the, position, he, went, to, work, making, changes, to, the, strategic, and, tactical, methods, of, the, prussian, army, changes, in, armament, and, means, of, communication, changes, in, the, training, of, staff, officers, such, as, instituting, staff, rides, and, changes, in, the, method, for, the, mobilization, of, the, army, he, also, instituted, a, formal, study, of, european, politics, in, connection, with, the, plans, for, campaigns, which, might, become, necessary, in, short, he, rapidly, put, into, place, the, features, of, a, modern, general, staff, by, 1860, his, reforms, were, completed, in, 1859, the, austro, sardinian, war, in, italy, caused, the, mobilization, of, the, prussian, army, though, it, did, not, fight, after, the, mobilization, the, army, was, reorganized, and, its, strength, was, nearly, doubled, the, reorganization, was, the, work, not, of, moltke, but, of, the, prince, regent, william, and, the, minister, of, war, albrecht, von, roon, moltke, watched, the, italian, campaign, closely, and, wrote, a, history, of, it, in, 1862, in, an, act, that, was, yet, another, first, in, military, affairs, this, history, was, attributed, on, the, title, page, to, the, historical, division, of, the, prussian, staff, in, 1860, added, a, railway, section, to, the, military, council, a, contemporary, would, write, that, von, moltke, never, made, an, important, decision, without, consulting, the, german, railway, timetables, moltke, had, been, following, developments, relating, to, the, railroad, ever, since, his, return, from, his, egypt, at, which, time, he, wrote, that, every, new, railway, development, is, a, military, benefit, and, for, national, defense, it, is, far, more, profitable, to, spend, a, few, million, on, completing, our, railways, than, on, new, fortresses, in, december, 1862, moltke, was, asked, for, an, opinion, upon, the, military, aspect, of, the, quarrel, with, denmark, he, thought, the, difficulty, would, be, to, bring, the, war, to, an, end, as, the, danish, army, would, if, possible, retire, to, the, islands, where, as, the, danes, had, the, command, of, the, sea, it, could, not, be, attacked, he, sketched, a, plan, for, turning, the, flank, of, the, danish, army, before, the, attack, upon, its, position, in, front, of, schleswig, he, suggested, that, by, this, means, its, retreat, might, be, cut, off, when, the, second, schleswig, war, began, in, february, 1864, moltke, was, not, sent, with, the, prussian, forces, but, kept, at, berlin, his, war, plan, was, mismanaged, and, the, danish, army, escaped, to, the, fortresses, of, dybb, l, and, fredericia, each, of, which, commanded, a, retreat, across, a, strait, to, an, island, dybb, l, and, fredericia, were, besieged, dybb, l, taken, by, storm, and, fredericia, abandoned, by, the, danes, without, assault, but, the, war, showed, no, signs, of, ending, the, danish, army, was, safe, on, the, islands, of, als, and, funen, on, 30, april, 1864, moltke, was, sent, to, be, chief, of, the, staff, for, the, allied, german, forces, he, and, friedrich, graf, von, wrangel, planned, landing, on, als, or, funen, on, june, 29, battalions, part, of, herwarth, von, bittenfeld, s, army, corps, crossed, to, als, in, boats, landed, while, under, fire, from, the, danish, batteries, and, quickly, seized, the, whole, island, as, far, as, the, kekenis, peninsula, days, later, eduard, vogel, von, falckenstein, s, corps, crossed, the, limfjord, and, occupied, the, remaining, parts, of, jutland, while, the, austrians, seized, the, various, islands, the, danish, government, dejected, by, the, course, of, the, war, ended, the, war, in, defeat, by, signing, the, treaty, of, vienna, in, contrast, to, antoine, henri, jomini, who, expounded, a, system, of, rules, moltke, was, a, disciple, of, carl, von, clausewitz, and, regarded, strategy, as, a, practical, art, of, adapting, means, to, ends, he, had, developed, the, methods, of, napoleon, in, accordance, with, altered, conditions, of, his, age, was, the, first, to, realize, the, great, defensive, power, of, modern, firearms, and, realized, that, an, enveloping, attack, had, become, more, formidable, than, an, attempt, to, pierce, an, enemy, s, front, he, developed, the, idea, of, clausewitz, and, said, the, purpose, of, war, is, to, carry, out, the, policy, of, the, government, with, arms, he, emphasized, the, autonomy, of, war, this, brought, conflicts, with, otto, von, bismarck, one, of, moltke, s, characteristic, strategies, seen, in, all, his, plans, for, war, with, russia, and, france, was, what, has, been, called, the, offensive, defensive, strategy, maneuvering, his, army, to, cut, the, lines, of, communication, of, the, enemy, force, and, then, dig, in, and, defeat, the, enemy, force, trying, to, re, establish, its, lines, of, communication, in, a, defensive, action, moltke, had, pondered, the, tactics, of, napoleon, at, the, battle, of, bautzen, when, the, emperor, brought, up, ney, s, corps, coming, from, a, great, distance, against, the, flank, of, the, allies, rather, than, to, unite, it, with, his, own, force, before, the, battle, he, had, also, drawn, this, conclusion, from, the, combined, action, of, the, allies, at, the, battle, of, waterloo, moltke, realized, that, the, increase, in, firepower, reduced, the, risk, a, defender, ran, in, splitting, his, forces, while, the, increase, in, the, size, of, armies, made, outflanking, maneuvers, more, practical, moltke, had, worked, out, the, conditions, of, the, march, and, supply, of, an, army, only, one, army, corps, could, be, moved, along, one, road, in, one, day, to, put, two, or, three, corps, on, the, same, road, meant, that, the, rear, corps, could, not, be, made, use, of, in, a, battle, at, the, front, several, corps, stationed, close, together, in, a, small, area, could, not, be, fed, for, more, than, a, day, or, two, he, believed, that, the, essence, of, strategy, lay, in, arrangements, for, the, separation, of, the, corps, for, marching, and, their, concentration, in, time, for, battle, to, make, a, large, army, manageable, it, must, be, broken, up, into, separate, armies, or, groups, of, corps, each, group, under, a, commander, authorized, to, regulate, its, movements, and, action, subject, to, the, instructions, of, the, commander, in, chief, as, regards, the, direction, and, purpose, of, its, operations, moltke, also, realized, that, the, expansion, in, the, size, of, armies, since, the, 1820s, made, it, impossible, to, exercise, detailed, control, over, the, entire, force, as, napoleon, or, wellington, had, done, in, battle, subordinates, would, have, to, use, initiative, and, independent, judgment, for, the, forces, to, be, effective, in, battle, campaign, and, battle, plans, should, encourage, and, take, advantage, of, the, decentralization, that, would, be, necessary, in, any, case, in, this, new, concept, commanders, of, distant, detachments, were, required, to, exercise, initiative, in, their, decision, making, and, moltke, emphasized, the, benefits, of, developing, officers, who, could, do, this, within, the, limits, of, the, senior, commander, s, intent, he, accomplished, this, by, means, of, mission, type, tactics, directives, stating, his, intentions, rather, than, detailed, orders, and, he, was, willing, to, accept, deviations, from, a, directive, provided, that, it, was, within, the, general, framework, of, the, mission, moltke, held, this, view, firmly, and, it, later, became, a, fundamental, of, all, german, military, theory, especially, for, the, field, manual, truppenf, hrung, moltke, s, thesis, was, that, military, strategy, had, to, be, understood, as, a, system, of, options, since, it, was, possible, to, plan, only, the, beginning, of, a, military, operation, as, a, result, he, considered, the, main, task, of, military, leaders, to, consist, in, the, extensive, preparation, of, all, possible, outcomes, his, thesis, can, be, summed, up, by, two, statements, one, famous, and, one, less, so, translated, into, english, as, no, plan, of, operations, extends, with, certainty, beyond, the, first, encounter, with, the, enemy, s, main, strength, or, no, plan, survives, contact, with, the, enemy, and, strategy, is, a, system, of, expedients, right, before, the, austro, prussian, war, moltke, was, promoted, to, general, of, the, infantry, moltke, planned, and, led, the, military, operations, during, the, austro, prussian, war, of, 1866, in, the, strategy, for, the, war, the, main, points, are, as, follows, first, moltke, demonstrated, a, concentration, of, effort, there, were, two, enemy, groups, opposing, the, prussians, the, austro, saxon, armies, 270, 000, and, their, allied, north, and, south, german, armies, some, 120, 000, strong, the, prussian, forces, were, smaller, by, some, 60, 000, but, moltke, was, determined, to, be, superior, at, the, decisive, point, moltke, divided, the, prussian, army, into, three, field, armies, the, first, army, the, second, army, and, the, army, of, the, elbe, the, first, army, consisted, of, three, army, corps, a, cavalry, corps, of, six, brigades, and, 300, guns, gathering, near, g, rlitz, prince, friedrich, karl, the, second, army, consisted, of, four, army, corps, a, cavalry, division, and, 336, guns, near, neisse, crown, prince, frederick, william, the, army, of, the, elbe, consisted, of, three, divisions, two, cavalry, brigades, and, 144, guns, in, the, cantonments, round, torgau, general, karl, von, bittenfeld, beside, the, three, field, armies, three, more, divisions, were, stationed, at, altona, general, edwin, von, manteuffel, one, at, minden, general, eduard, von, falckenstein, and, one, at, wetzlar, general, gustav, von, beyer, the, three, field, armies, placed, to, attack, austria, consisted, of, some, 278, 000, men, leaving, just, 48, 000, men, remaining, to, defend, against, austria, s, german, allies, those, 48, 000, led, by, falckenstein, managed, to, capture, the, hanoverian, army, in, less, than, two, weeks, and, then, to, attack, and, drive, away, the, south, german, forces, in, dealing, with, the, austrian, and, saxon, army, the, difficulty, was, to, have, the, prussian, army, ready, first, this, was, not, easy, as, the, king, would, not, mobilize, until, after, the, austrians, moltke, s, railway, knowledge, helped, him, to, save, time, five, railway, lines, led, from, the, various, prussian, provinces, to, a, series, of, points, on, the, southern, frontier, by, employing, all, these, railways, at, once, moltke, had, all, his, army, corps, moved, simultaneously, from, their, peacetime, garrisons, to, the, frontier, after, marching, into, saxony, the, saxon, army, retreated, into, bohemia, moltke, had, two, prussian, armies, about, 100, mi, 160, km, apart, the, problem, was, how, to, bring, them, together, to, catch, the, austrian, army, between, them, like, the, french, at, waterloo, between, wellington, and, bl, cher, he, determined, to, bring, his, two, armies, together, by, directing, each, of, them, to, advance, towards, gitschin, on, june, 22, 1866, moltke, told, the, two, princes, that, gitschin, was, the, desirable, point, for, juncture, of, the, two, armies, he, foresaw, that, the, march, of, the, crown, prince, would, probably, bring, him, into, collision, with, a, portion, of, the, austrian, army, prince, friedrich, karl, sent, the, 3rd, division, to, gitschin, but, the, crown, prince, had, 100, 000, men, and, it, was, not, likely, that, the, austrians, could, have, a, stronger, force, when, friedrich, karl, commanded, further, attacks, straining, his, own, supply, lines, moltke, inferred, that, the, prince, was, trying, to, take, prague, by, himself, the, austrians, under, ludwig, von, benedek, marched, faster, than, moltke, expected, and, might, have, opposed, prince, frederick, charles, the, red, prince, with, four, or, five, corps, but, benedek, s, attention, was, centered, on, crown, prince, frederick, william, and, his, four, corps, not, under, a, common, command, were, beaten, in, detail, on, 1, july, benedek, collected, his, shaken, forces, into, a, defensive, position, in, front, of, k, niggr, tz, moltke, s, two, armies, were, now, within, a, short, march, of, one, another, and, of, the, enemy, on, 3, july, they, were, brought, into, action, the, first, army, against, the, austrian, forces, and, the, second, against, the, austrian, right, flank, the, austrian, army, was, completely, defeated, and, the, campaign, and, war, were, won, moltke, was, not, quite, satisfied, with, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, he, tried, to, have, the, prussian, army, of, the, elbe, brought, up, above, k, niggr, tz, so, as, to, prevent, the, austrian, retreat, but, its, commanding, officer, failed, to, get, there, in, time, he, also, tried, to, prevent, the, prussian, first, army, from, pushing, its, attack, too, hard, hoping, in, that, way, to, keep, the, austrians, in, their, position, until, their, retreat, should, be, cut, off, by, the, crown, prince, s, army, but, this, also, did, not, happen, during, the, negotiations, otto, von, bismarck, opposed, the, king, s, wish, to, annex, the, kingdom, of, saxony, and, other, territory, beyond, what, was, actually, taken, he, feared, the, active, intervention, of, france, moltke, however, was, confident, of, beating, both, french, and, austrians, if, the, french, should, intervene, and, he, submitted, to, bismarck, his, plans, in, case, a, war, against, both, france, and, austria, proved, necessary, after, the, peace, the, prussian, government, voted, moltke, the, sum, of, 30, 000, marks, equivalent, to, approximately, 225, 000, us, in, 2016, with, which, he, bought, the, estate, of, creisau, present, day, krzy, owa, near, schweidnitz, present, day, widnica, in, the, province, of, silesia, in, 1867, the, campaign, of, 1866, in, germany, was, published, this, history, was, produced, under, moltke, s, supervision, and, was, regarded, as, quite, accurate, at, the, time, in, the, same, year, moltke, became, a, member, of, reichstag, as, a, member, of, the, conservative, party, he, frequently, spoke, on, military, issues, on, 24, december, 1868, moltke, s, wife, died, at, berlin, her, remains, were, buried, in, a, small, chapel, erected, by, moltke, as, a, mausoleum, in, the, park, at, creisau, after, the, war, bismarck, assessed, him, that, he, was, a, reliable, soldier, moltke, again, planned, and, led, the, prussian, armies, in, the, franco, prussian, war, 1870, 71, which, paved, the, way, for, the, creation, of, the, prussian, led, german, empire, in, 1871, the, aspects, of, such, a, war, had, occupied, moltke, s, attention, almost, continuously, since, 1857, documents, published, after, his, death, show, the, many, times, he, considered, such, a, war, and, the, best, arrangement, of, the, prussian, or, german, forces, for, such, a, campaign, the, arrangements, for, the, transport, of, the, army, by, railway, were, revised, annually, to, suit, the, changes, in, his, plans, brought, about, by, political, conditions, and, by, the, growth, of, the, army, as, well, as, by, the, improvement, of, the, prussian, system, of, railways, the, successes, of, 1866, had, strengthened, moltke, s, position, so, that, when, on, 5, july, 1870, the, order, for, the, mobilization, of, the, prussian, and, south, german, forces, was, issued, his, plans, were, adopted, without, dispute, five, days, later, he, was, appointed, chief, of, staff, of, the, army, for, the, duration, of, the, war, this, gave, moltke, the, right, to, issue, orders, which, were, equivalent, to, royal, commands, moltke, s, plan, was, to, assemble, the, whole, army, south, of, mainz, this, being, one, district, in, which, a, single, army, could, secure, the, defence, of, the, whole, frontier, if, the, french, disregarded, the, neutrality, of, belgium, and, luxembourg, and, advanced, towards, cologne, or, any, other, point, on, the, lower, rhine, the, german, army, would, be, able, to, strike, at, their, flank, at, the, same, time, the, rhine, itself, with, the, fortresses, of, koblenz, cologne, and, wesel, would, be, a, serious, obstacle, in, their, path, if, the, french, should, attempt, to, invade, south, germany, an, advance, by, the, germans, up, the, rhine, river, would, threaten, their, communications, moltke, expected, that, the, french, would, be, compelled, by, the, direction, of, their, railways, to, collect, the, greater, part, of, their, army, near, metz, and, a, smaller, portion, near, strasbourg, the, german, forces, were, grouped, into, three, armies, the, first, of, 60, 000, men, under, von, steinmetz, on, the, moselle, below, trier, the, second, of, 130, 000, men, under, prince, friedrich, karl, of, prussia, around, homburg, with, a, reserve, of, 60, 000, men, behind, them, and, the, third, of, 130, 000, men, under, the, crown, prince, frederick, william, at, landau, three, army, corps, were, held, back, in, north, eastern, germany, in, case, austria, hungary, should, make, common, cause, with, france, he, reported, this, to, the, king, on, 17, april, 1870, moltke, s, plan, was, that, the, three, armies, while, advancing, should, make, a, right, wheel, so, that, the, first, army, on, the, right, would, reach, the, bank, of, the, moselle, opposite, metz, while, the, second, and, third, armies, should, push, forward, the, third, army, to, defeat, the, french, force, near, strasbourg, and, the, second, to, strike, the, moselle, near, pont, mousson, if, the, french, army, should, be, found, in, front, of, the, second, army, it, would, be, attacked, in, front, by, the, second, army, and, in, flank, by, the, first, or, the, third, or, both, if, it, should, be, found, on, or, north, of, the, line, from, saarburg, to, lun, ville, it, could, still, be, attacked, from, two, sides, by, the, second, and, third, armies, in, co, operation, the, intention, of, the, great, right, wheel, was, to, attack, the, principal, french, army, in, such, a, direction, as, to, drive, it, north, and, cut, its, communications, with, paris, the, fortress, of, metz, was, to, be, only, monitored, and, the, main, german, forces, after, defeating, the, chief, french, army, would, then, march, against, paris, this, plan, was, carried, out, in, its, broad, outlines, the, battle, of, w, rth, was, brought, on, prematurely, and, therefore, led, not, to, the, capture, of, macmahon, s, army, which, was, intended, but, only, to, its, defeat, and, hasty, retreat, as, far, as, ch, lons, the, battle, of, spicheren, was, not, intended, by, moltke, who, wished, to, keep, bazaine, s, army, on, the, saar, until, he, could, attack, it, with, the, second, army, in, front, and, the, first, army, on, its, left, flank, but, these, unexpected, victories, did, not, disconcert, moltke, who, carried, out, his, intended, advance, to, pont, mousson, crossed, the, moselle, with, the, first, and, second, armies, then, faced, north, and, wheeled, round, so, that, the, effect, of, the, battle, of, gravelotte, was, to, drive, bazaine, into, the, fortress, of, metz, and, cut, him, off, from, paris, nothing, shows, moltke, s, insight, and, strength, of, purpose, in, a, clearer, light, than, his, determination, to, attack, on, 18, august, at, the, battle, of, gravelotte, when, other, strategists, would, have, thought, that, the, strategic, victory, having, been, gained, a, tactical, victory, was, unnecessary, he, has, been, blamed, for, the, last, attack, at, gravelotte, which, incurred, heavy, loss, for, no, gain, but, it, is, now, known, that, this, attack, was, ordered, by, the, king, and, that, moltke, blamed, himself, for, not, having, used, his, influence, to, prevent, it, during, the, night, following, the, battle, moltke, left, one, army, to, invest, bazaine, at, metz, and, set, out, with, the, two, others, to, march, towards, paris, the, more, southerly, one, leading, so, that, when, macmahon, s, army, should, be, found, the, main, blow, might, be, delivered, from, the, south, and, macmahon, driven, to, the, north, on, 25, august, it, was, found, that, macmahon, was, moving, north, east, for, the, relief, of, bazaine, the, moment, moltke, was, satisfied, of, the, accuracy, of, his, information, he, ordered, the, german, columns, to, turn, their, faces, north, instead, of, west, macmahon, s, right, wing, was, attacked, at, beaumont, while, attempting, to, cross, the, meuse, his, advance, necessarily, abandoned, and, his, army, with, difficulty, collected, at, sedan, at, the, battle, of, sedan, the, two, german, armies, surrounded, the, french, army, which, on, 1, september, was, attacked, from, multiple, sides, and, compelled, to, surrender, moltke, then, resumed, the, advance, on, paris, which, was, also, surrounded, from, this, time, moltke, s, strategy, is, remarkable, for, its, judicious, economy, of, force, for, he, was, wise, enough, never, to, attempt, more, than, was, practicable, with, the, means, at, his, disposal, the, surrender, of, metz, and, of, paris, was, just, a, question, of, time, and, the, problem, was, while, maintaining, the, sieges, to, be, able, to, ward, off, the, attacks, of, the, new, french, armies, levied, for, the, purpose, of, raising, the, siege, of, paris, the, siege, of, metz, ended, with, its, surrender, on, 27, october, on, 28, january, 1871, an, armistice, was, concluded, at, versailles, by, which, the, garrison, became, virtually, prisoners, and, the, war, was, ended,
