in, his, memoirs, he, described, his, interview, with, haussmann, it, was, monsieur, haussmann, who, impressed, me, the, most, it, was, a, strange, thing, but, it, was, less, his, talents, and, his, remarkable, intelligence, that, appealed, to, me, but, the, defects, in, his, character, i, had, in, front, of, me, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, men, of, our, time, big, strong, vigorous, energetic, and, at, the, same, time, clever, and, devious, with, a, spirit, full, of, resources, this, audacious, man, wasn, t, afraid, to, show, who, he, was, he, told, me, all, of, his, accomplishments, during, his, administrative, career, leaving, out, nothing, he, could, have, talked, for, six, hours, without, a, break, since, it, was, his, favourite, subject, himself, i, wasn, t, at, all, displeased, it, seemed, to, me, that, he, was, exactly, the, man, i, needed, to, fight, against, the, ideas, and, prejudices, of, a, whole, school, of, economics, against, devious, people, and, skeptics, coming, from, the, stock, market, against, those, who, were, not, very, scrupulous, about, their, methods, he, was, just, the, man, whereas, a, gentleman, of, the, most, elevated, spirit, cleverness, with, the, most, straight, and, noble, character, would, inevitably, fail, this, vigorous, athlete, full, of, audacity, and, skill, capable, of, opposing, expedients, with, better, expedients, traps, with, more, clever, traps, would, certainly, succeed, i, told, him, about, the, paris, works, and, offered, to, put, him, in, charge, persigny, sent, him, to, napoleon, iii, with, the, recommendation, that, he, was, exactly, the, man, needed, to, carry, out, his, renewal, plans, for, paris, on, 22, june, 1853, napoleon, made, him, prefect, of, the, seine, on, 29, june, the,

a, huge, map, of, paris, in, his, office, marked, with, coloured, lines, where, he, wanted, new, boulevards, to, be, to, a, degree, the, boulevard, system, was, planned, as, a, mechanism, for, the, easy, deployment, of, troops, and, artillery, but, its, main, purpose, was, to, help, relieve, traffic, congestion, in, a, dense, city, and, interconnect, its, landmark, buildings, he, and, haussmann, met, almost, every, day, to, discuss, the, projects, and, overcome, the, enormous, obstacles, and, opposition, they, faced, as, they, built, the, new, paris, the, population, of, paris, had, doubled, since, 1815, with, no, increase, in, its, area, to, accommodate, the, growing, population, and, those, who, would, be, forced, from, the, centre, by, the, new, boulevards, and, squares, napoleon, iii, planned, to, build, he, issued, a, decree, annexing, eleven, surrounding, communes, and, increasing, the, number, of, arrondissements, from, twelve, to, twenty, which, enlarged, the, city, to, its, modern, boundaries, for, the, nearly, two, decades, of, napoleon, iii, s, reign, and, for, a, decade, afterwards, most, of, paris, was, an, enormous, construction, site, to, bring, fresh, water, to, the, city, his, hydraulic, engineer, eug, ne, belgrand, built, a, new, aqueduct, to, bring, clean, water, from, the, vanne, river, in, champagne, and, a, new, huge, reservoir, near, the, future, parc,

the, water, throughout, the, city, he, built, a, second, network, using, the, less, clean, water, from, the, ourq, and, the, seine, to, wash, the, streets, and, water, the, new, park, and, gardens, he, completely, rebuilt, the, paris, sewers, and, installed, miles, of, pipes, to, distribute, gas, for, thousands, of, new, streetlights, along, the, paris, streets, beginning, in, 1854, in, the, centre, of, the, city, haussmann, s, workers, tore, down, hundreds, of, old, buildings, and, cut, eighty, kilometres, of, new, avenues, connecting, the, central, points, of, the, city, buildings, along, these, avenues, were, required, to, be, the, same, height, and, in, a, similar, style, and, to, be, faced, with, cream, coloured, stone, creating, the, uniform, look, of, paris, boulevards, victor, hugo, mentioned, that, it, was, hardly, possible, to, distinguish, what, the, house, in, front, of, you, was, for, theatre, shop, or, library, haussmann, managed, to, rebuild, the, city, in, 17, years, on, his, own, estimation, the, new, boulevards, and, open, spaces, displaced, 350, 000, people, by, 1870, one, fifth, of, the, streets, in, central, paris, were, his, creation, he, had, spent, 2, 5, billion, francs, on, the, city, one, in, five, parisian, workers, was, employed, in, the, building, trade, to, connect, the, city, with, the, rest, of, france, napoleon, iii, built, two,

built, a, new, municipal, hospital, the, h, tel, dieu, in, the, place, of, crumbling, medieval, buildings, on, the, ile, de, la, cit, the, signature, architectural, landmark, was, the, paris, opera, the, largest, theatre, in, the, world, designed, by, charles, garnier, crowning, the, center, of, napoleon, iii, s, new, paris, when, the, empress, eugenie, saw, the, model, of, the, opera, house, and, asked, the, architect, what, the, style, was, garnier, said, simply, napoleon, the, third, napoleon, iii, also, wanted, to, build, new, parks, and, gardens, for, the, recreation, and, relaxation, of, the, parisians, particularly, those, in, the, new, neighbourhoods, of, the, expanding, city, napoleon, iii, s, new, parks, were, inspired, by, his, memories, of, the, parks, in, london, especially, hyde, park, where, he, had, strolled, and, promenaded, in, a, carriage, while, in, exile, but, he, wanted, to, build, on, a, much, larger, scale, working, with, haussmann, and, adolphe, alphand, the, engineer, who, headed, the, new, service, of, promenades, and, plantations, he, laid, out, a, plan, for, four, major, parks, at, the, cardinal, points, of, the, compass, around, the, city, thousands, of, workers, and, gardeners, began, to, dig, lakes, build, cascades, plant, lawns, flowerbeds, trees, and, construct, chalets, and, grottoes, napoleon, iii, created, the, bois, de, boulogne, 1852, 58, to, the, west, of, paris, the, bois, de, vincennes, 1860, 65, to, the, east, the, parc, des, buttes, chaumont, 1865, 67, to, the, north, and, parc, montsouris, 1865, 78, to, the, south, in, addition, to, building, the, four, large, parks, haussmann, had, the, city, s, older, parks, including, parc, monceau, formerly, owned, by, the, orleans, family, and, the, jardin, du, luxembourg, refurbished, and, replanted, he, created, twenty, small, parks, and, gardens, in, the, neighbourhoods, as, miniature, versions, of, his, large, parks, alphand, termed, these, small, parks, green, and, flowering, salons, the, intention, of, napoleon, s, plan, was, to, have, one, park, in, each, of, the, eighty, neighbourhoods, of, paris, so, no, one, was, more, than, 10, minutes, walk, from, a, park, the, parks, were, an, immediate, success, with, all, classes, of, parisians, to, thank, haussmann, for, his, work, napoleon, iii, proposed, in, 1857, to, make, haussmann, a, member, of, the, french, senate, and, to, give, him, an, honorary, title, as, he, had, done, for, some, of, his, generals, haussmann, asked, for, the, title, of, baron, which, as, he, said, in, his, memoirs, had, been, the, title, of, his, maternal, grandfather, georges, fr, d, ric, baron, dentzel, a, general, under, napoleon, i, of, whom, haussmann, was, the, only, living, male, descendant, according, to, his, memoirs, he, joked, that, he, might, consider, the, title, aqueduc, a, pun, on, the, french, words, for, duke, and, aqueduct, but, that, no, such, title, existed, this, use, of, baron, however, was, not, officially, sanctioned, and, he, remained, legally, monsieur, haussmann, during, the, first, half, of, the, reign, of, napoleon, iii, the, french, legislature, had, little, real, power, all, decisions, were, made, by, the, emperor, beginning, in, 1860, however, napoleon, decided, to, liberalise, the, empire, and, give, legislators, power, the, members, of, the, opposition, in, the, parliament, increasingly, aimed, their, criticism, of, napoleon, iii, at, haussmann, criticising, his, spending, and, high, handed, attitude, toward, the, parliament, the, cost, of, the, reconstruction, projects, was, also, rising, rapidly, in, december, 1858, the, council, of, state, ruled, that, a, property, owner, whose, land, was, expropriated, could, retain, the, land, that, was, not, specifically, needed, for, the, street, greatly, increasing, the, cost, of, expropriation, property, owners, also, became, much, more, clever, in, claiming, higher, payments, for, their, buildings, often, by, creating, sham, shops, and, businesses, within, their, buildings, the, cost, of, expropriations, jumped, from, 70, million, francs, for, the, first, projects, to, about, 230, million, francs, for, the, second, wave, of, projects, in, 1858, the, cour, des, comptes, which, oversaw, the, finances, of, the, empire, ruled, that, the, caisses, des, grands, travaux, was, operating, illegally, by, making, disguised, loans, to, private, companies, the, court, ruled, that, such, loans, had, to, be, approved, by, the, parliament, the, parliament, was, asked, to, approve, a, loan, of, 250, millions, francs, in, 1865, and, another, 260, million, francs, in, 1869, the, members, of, the, opposition, were, particularly, outraged, when, in, 1866, he, took, away, part, of, the, luxembourg, to, make, room, for, the, new, avenue, between, the, luxembourg, gardens, and, the, observatory, and, destroyed, the, old, garden, nursery, which, lay, between, rue, auguste, comte, rue, d, assas, and, the, avenue, de, l, observatoire, when, the, emperor, and, empress, attended, a, performance, at, the, odeon, theater, near, the, luxembourg, gardens, members, of, the, audience, shouted, dismiss, haussmann, and, jeered, the, emperor, nonetheless, the, emperor, stood, by, haussmann, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, parliamentary, opposition, to, napoleon, jules, ferry, ridiculed, the, accounting, practices, of, haussmann, as, les, comptes, fantastiques, de, haussmann, or, the, fantastic, accounts, of, haussmann, in, 1867, a, play, on, words, of, les, contes, fantastiques, de, hoffmann, the, fantastical, tales, of, hoffmann, the, republican, opposition, to, napoleon, iii, won, many, parliamentary, seats, in, the, 1869, elections, and, increased, its,

captured, by, the, germans, and, the, empire, was, overthrown, in, his, memoires, haussmann, had, this, comment, on, his, dismissal, in, the, eyes, of, the, parisians, who, like, routine, in, things, but, are, changeable, when, it, comes, to, people, i, committed, two, great, wrongs, over, the, course, of, seventeen, years, i, disturbed, their, daily, habits, by, turning, paris, upside, down, and, they, had, to, look, at, the, same, face, of, the, prefect, in, the, hotel, de, ville, these, were, two, unforgivable, complaints, after, the, fall, of, napoleon, iii, haussmann, spent, about, a, year, abroad, but, he, re, entered, public, life, in, 1877, when, he, became, bonapartist, deputy, for, ajaccio, his, later, years, were, occupied, with, the, preparation, of, his, m, moires, three,

and, parks, in, cairo, buenos, aires, brussels, rome, vienna, stockholm, madrid, and, barcelona, after, the, paris, international, exposition, of, 1867, william, i, the, king, of, prussia, carried, back, to, berlin, a, large, map, showing, haussmann, s, projects, which, influenced, the, future, planning, of, that, city, his, work, also, inspired, the, city, beautiful, movement, in, the, united, states, frederick, law, olmsted, the, designer, of, central, park, in, new, york, visited, the, bois, de, boulogne, eight, times, during, his, 1859, study, trip, to, europe, and, was, also, influenced, by, the, innovations, of, the, parc, des, buttes, chaumont, the, american, architect, daniel, burnham, borrowed, liberally, from, haussmann, s, plan, and, incorporated, the, diagonal,

never, before, had, a, major, city, been, completely, rebuilt, when, it, was, still, intact, london, rome, copenhagen, and, lisbon, had, been, rebuilt, after, major, fires, or, earthquakes, napoleon, iii, began, his, grand, projects, when, he, was, prince, president, when, the, government, had, a, full, treasury, in, his, 1851, plan, he, proposed, to, extend, the, rue, de, rivoli, to, connect, the, louvre, with, the, h, tel, de, ville, to, build, a, wide, new, avenue, the, boulevard, de, strasbourg, on, a, north, south, axis, and, to, complete, the, central, produce, market, les, halles, long, unfinished, he, approached, the, parliament, and, received, authorisation, to, borrow, fifty, million, francs, the, emperor, s, ambitions, were, much, greater, he, wanted, to, finish, the, building, of, the, louvre, and, to, create, an, enormous, new, park, the, bois, de, boulogne, to, the, west, of, paris, his, prefect, of, the, seine, berger, protested, that, paris, did, not, have, the, money, at, this, point, napoleon, dismissed, berger, and, hired, haussmann, and, haussmann, looked, for, a, better, way, to, finance, his, projects, napoleon, iii, was, especially, anxious, to, finish, the, extension, of, rue, de, rivoli, from, the, louvre, to, the, hotel, de, ville, before, the, opening, of, the, paris, universal, exposition, of, 1855, napoleon, iii, demanded, the, construction, of, a, new, luxury, hotel, to, house, his, imperial, guests, during, the, exposition, napoleon, iii, and, haussmann, turned, for, funding, to, two, parisian, bankers, emile, pereire, and, isaac, pereire, who, had, created, a, bank, called, cr, dit, mobilier, in, december, 1854, with, no, time, to, lose, before, the, opening, of, the, exposition, the, pereire, brothers, created, a, new, company, to, construct, the, street, and, the, hotel, they, sold, 240, 000, shares, for, one, hundred, francs, each, with, 106, 665, shares, purchased, by, credit, mobilier, 42, 220, by, the, pereire, brothers, and, the, rest, to, private, investors, in, 1850, and, 1851, at, napoleon, s, request, new, laws, were, passed, making, it, easier, for, paris, to, expropriate, private, land, for, public, purposes, they, allowed, the, city, to, expropriate, in, the, public, interest, land, for, new, streets, and, all, of, the, building, sites, on, both, sides, of, the, new, streets, an, asset, of, enormous, value, the, government, expropriated, the, land, with, buildings, that, it, needed, to, build, the, new, street, and, hotel, the, owners, were, paid, a, price, set, by, an, arbitration, board, the, government, then, sold, the, land, and, buildings, to, the, company, established, by, the, pereire, brothers, which, tore, down, the, old, buildings, constructed, a, new, street, sidewalks, and, a, new, square, the, place, du, palais, royale, they, built, new, buildings, along, the, new, street, and, sold, them, or, rented, them, to, new, owners, they, constructed, the, hotel, du, louvre, one, of, the, largest, buildings, in, the, city, and, one, of, the, first, modern, luxury, hotels, in, paris, the, company, also, built, rows, of, luxury, shops, under, a, covered, arcade, along, the, rue, de, rivoli, and, around, the, hotel, which, they, rented, to, shopkeepers, construction, began, immediately, three, thousand, workers, laboured, both, day, and, night, for, two, years, to, complete, the, street, and, hotel, which, were, finished, in, time, for, the, exposition, this, was, the, basic, method, adopted, by, haussmann, to, finance, the, reconstruction, of, paris, the, government, expropriated, the, old, buildings, compensated, the, owners, and, private, companies, built, the, new, streets, and, buildings, following, the, standards, set, by, haussmann, the, private, companies, were, often, paid, for, the, construction, work, they, did, with, city, land, which, they, could, then, develop, and, sell, in, 1854, the, parliament, approved, another, loan, of, sixty, million, francs, but, haussmann, needed, far, more, for, his, future, projects, on, 14, november, 1858, napoleon, and, haussmann, created, the, caisse, des, travaux, de, la, ville, specifically, to, finance, the, reconstruction, projects, it, borrowed, money, at, a, higher, rate, of, interest, than, regular, city, bonds, and, used, the, money, to, pay, private, companies, such, as, that, of, pereire, brothers, to, rebuild, the, city, it, was, a, great, relief, for, the, city, s, finances, haussmann, wrote, later, in, his, memoirs, which, allowed, the, city, to, carry, out, several, grand, operations, at, the, same, time, with, rapid, execution, in, short, more, economically, it, functioned, entirely, independently, of, the, parliament, which, greatly, irritated, the, members, of, parliament, haussmann, spent, 2, 5, billion, francs, on, rebuilding, paris, a, sum, that, staggered, his, critics, jules, ferry, and, other, political, rivals, of, napoleon, alleged, that, haussmann, had, recklessly, squandered, money, and, planned, poorly, they, alleged, he, had, falsified, accounts, while, napoleon, had, hired, haussmann, the, political, attacks, were, so, intense, that, he, forced, haussmann, to, become, a, scapegoat, hoping, his, resignation, would, satisfy, the, bourgeois, parties, which, had, become, increasingly, angered, during, the, economic, depression, of, the, late, 1860s, haussmann, s, plans, with, their, radical, redevelopment, coincided, with, a, time, of, intense, political, activity, in, paris, many, parisians, were, troubled, by, the, destruction, of, old, roots, historian, robert, herbert, says, that, the, impressionist, movement, depicted, this, loss, of, connection, in, such, paintings, as, manet, s, a, bar, at, the, folies, berg, re, the, subject, of, the, painting, is, talking, to, a, man, seen, in, the, mirror, behind, her, but, seems, disengaged, according, to, herbert, this, is, a, symptom, of, living, in, paris, at, this, time, the, citizens, became, detached, from, one, another, the, continuous, destruction, of, physical, paris, led, to, a, destruction, of, social, paris, as, well, the, poet, charles, baudelaire, witnessed, these, changes, and, wrote, the, poem, the, swan, in, response, the, poem, is, a, lament, for, and, critique, of, the, destruction, of, the, medieval, city, in, the, name, of, progress, old, paris, is, gone, no, human, heart, changes, half, so, fast, as, a, city, s, face, there, used, to, be, a, poultry, market, here, and, one, cold, morning, i, saw, a, swan, that, had, broken, out, of, its, cage, webbed, feet, clumsy, on, the, cobblestones, white, feathers, dragging, through, uneven, ruts, and, obstinately, pecking, at, the, drains, paris, changes, but, in, sadness, like, mine, nothing, stirs, new, buildings, old, neighbourhoods, turn, to, allegory, and, memories, weigh, more, than, stone, haussmann, was, also, criticized, for, the, great, cost, of, his, project, napoleon, iii, deposed, haussmann, on, 5, january, 1870, in, order, to, improve, his, own, flagging, popularity, haussmann, was, a, favourite, target, of, the, situationist, s, critique, besides, pointing, out, the, repressive, aims, that, were, achieved, by, haussmann, s, urbanism, guy, debord, and, his, friends, who, considered, urbanism, to, be, a, state, science, or, inherently, capitalist, science, also, underlined, that, he, nicely, separated, leisure, areas, from, work, places, thus, announcing, modern, functionalism, as, illustrated, by, le, corbusier, s, precise, zone, tripartition, with, one, zone, for, circulation, one, for, housing, and, one, for, labour, some, of, the, contemporary, critics, of, haussmann, softened, their, views, over, time, jules, simon, was, an, ardent, republican, who, had, refused, to, take, an, oath, to, napoleon, iii, and, had, been, a, fierce, critic, of, haussmann, in, parliament, but, in, 1882, he, wrote, of, haussmann, in, the, gaulois, he, tried, to, make, paris, a, magnificent, city, and, he, succeeded, completely, when, he, took, paris, in, hand, and, managed, our, affairs, rue, saint, honore, and, rue, saint, antoine, were, still, the, largest, streets, in, the, city, we, had, no, other, promenades, than, the, grands, boulevards, and, the, tuileries, the, champs, lys, es, was, most, of, the, time, a, sewer, the, bois, de, boulogne, was, at, the, end, of, the, world, we, were, lacking, water, markets, light, in, those, far, off, times, which, are, only, thirty, years, past, he, demolished, neighbourhoods, one, could, say, entire, cities, they, cried, that, he, would, create, a, plague, he, let, us, cry, and, on, the, contrary, through, his, intelligent, piercing, of, streets, he, gave, us, air, health, and, life, here, he, created, a, street, there, he, created, an, avenue, or, a, boulevard, here, a, place, a, square, a, promenade, out, of, emptiness, he, made, the, champs, lys, es, the, bois, de, boulogne, the, bois, de, vincennes, he, introduced, into, his, beautiful, capital, trees, and, flowers, and, populated, it, with, statues, some, critics, and, historians, in, the, 20th, century, notably, lewis, mumford, argued, that, the, real, purpose, of, haussmann, s, boulevards, was, to, make, it, easier, for, the, army, to, crush, popular, uprisings, according, to, these, critics, the, wide, boulevards, gave, the, army, greater, mobility, a, wider, range, of, fire, for, their, cannon, and, made, it, harder, to, block, streets, with, barricades, they, argued, that, the, boulevards, built, by, haussmann, allowed, the, french, army, to, easily, suppress, the, paris, commune, in, 1871, other, historians, disputed, this, argument, they, noted, that, while, haussmann, sometimes, mentioned, the, military, advantages, of, the, boulevards, when, seeking, funding, for, his, projects, it, was, never, the, main, purpose, their, main, purpose, according, to, napoleon, iii, and, haussmann, was, to, improve, traffic, circulation, provide, space, and, light, and, views, of, the, city, landmarks, and, to, beautify, paris, haussmann, did, not, deny, the, military, value, of, the, wider, streets, in, his, memoires, he, wrote, that, his, new, boulevard, sebastopol, resulted, in, the, gutting, of, old, paris, of, the, quarter, of, riots, and, barricades, he, admitted, he, sometimes, used, this, argument, with, the, parliament, to, justify, the, high, cost, of, his, projects, arguing, that, they, were, for, national, defense, and, should, be, paid, for, at, least, partially, by, the, state, he, wrote, but, as, for, me, i, who, was, the, promoter, of, these, additions, made, to, original, project, i, declare, that, i, never, thought, in, the, least, in, adding, them, of, their, greater, or, lesser, strategic, value, the, paris, urban, historian, patrice, de, moncan, wrote, to, see, the, works, created, by, haussmann, and, napoleon, iii, only, from, the, perspective, of, their, strategic, value, is, very, reductive, the, emperor, was, a, convinced, follower, of, saint, simon, his, desire, to, make, paris, the, economic, capital, of, france, a, more, open, more, healthy, city, not, only, for, the, upper, classes, but, also, for, the, workers, cannot, be, denied, and, should, be, recognised, as, the, primary, motivation, during, the, suppression, of, the, paris, commune, in, 1871, the, newly, built, boulevards, were, not, a, major, factor, in, the, commune, s, defeat, the, communards, were, defeated, in, one, week, not, because, of, haussmann, s, boulevards, but, because, they, were, outnumbered, by, five, to, one, they, had, fewer, weapons, and, fewer, men, trained, to, use, them, they, had, no, plan, for, the, defense, of, the, city, they, had, very, few, experienced, officers, and, there, was, no, single, commander, with, each, neighborhood, left, to, defend, itself, and, they, had, no, hope, of, military, support, from, outside, of, paris
