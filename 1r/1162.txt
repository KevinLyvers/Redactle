john, 24, december, 1166, 19, october, 1216, was, king, of, england, from, 1199, until, his, death, in, 1216, he, lost, the, duchy, of, normandy, and, most, of, his, other, french, lands, to, king, philip, ii, of, france, resulting, in, the, collapse, of, the, angevin, empire, and, contributing, to, the, subsequent, growth, in, power, of, the, french, capetian, dynasty, during, the, 13th, century, the, baronial, revolt, at, the, end, of, john, s, reign, led, to, the, sealing, of, magna, carta, a, document, considered, an, early, step, in, the, evolution, of, the, constitution, of, the, united, kingdom, john, was, the, youngest, son, of, king, henry, ii, of, england, and, duchess, eleanor, of, aquitaine, he, was, nicknamed, john, lackland, norman, jean, sans, terre, lit, john, without, land, because, he, was, not, expected, to, inherit, significant, lands, he, became, henry, s, favourite, child, following, the, failed, revolt, of, 1173, 1174, by, his, brothers, henry, the, young, king, richard, and, geoffrey, against, the, king, john, was, appointed, lord, of, ireland, in, 1177, and, given, lands, in, england, and, on, the, continent, he, unsuccessfully, attempted, a, rebellion, against, the, royal, administrators, of, his, brother, king, richard, i, while, richard, was, participating, in, the, third, crusade, but, he, was, proclaimed, king, after, richard, died, in, 1199, he, came, to, an, agreement, with, philip, ii, of, france, to, recognise, john, s, possession, of, the, continental, angevin, lands, at, the, peace, treaty, of, le, goulet, in, 1200, when, war, with, france, broke, out, again, in, 1202, john, achieved, early, victories, but, shortages, of, military, resources, and, his, treatment, of, norman, breton, and, anjou, nobles, resulted, in, the, collapse, of, his, empire, in, northern, france, in, 1204, he, spent, much, of, the, next, decade, attempting, to, regain, these, lands, raising, huge, revenues, reforming, his, armed, forces, and, rebuilding, continental, alliances, his, judicial, reforms, had, a, lasting, effect, on, the, english, common, law, system, as, well, as, providing, an, additional, source, of, revenue, an, argument, with, pope, innocent, iii, led, to, john, s, excommunication, in, 1209, a, dispute, he, finally, settled, in, 1213, john, s, attempt, to, defeat, philip, in, 1214, failed, because, of, the, french, victory, over, john, s, allies, at, the, battle, of, bouvines, when, he, returned, to, england, john, faced, a, rebellion, by, many, of, his, barons, who, were, unhappy, with, his, fiscal, policies, and, his, treatment, of, many, of, england, s, most, powerful, nobles, magna, carta, was, drafted, as, a, peace, treaty, between, john, and, the, barons, and, agreed, in, 1215, however, neither, side, complied, with, its, conditions, and, civil, war, broke, out, shortly, afterwards, with, the, barons, aided, by, prince, louis, of, france, it, soon, descended, into, a, stalemate, john, died, of, dysentery, contracted, while, on, campaign, in, eastern, england, during, late, 1216, supporters, of, his, son, henry, iii, went, on, to, achieve, victory, over, louis, and, the, rebel, barons, the, following, year, contemporary, chroniclers, were, mostly, critical, of, john, s, performance, as, king, and, his, reign, has, since, been, the, subject, of, significant, debate, and, periodic, revision, by, historians, from, the, 16th, century, onwards, historian, jim, bradbury, has, summarised, the, current, historical, opinion, of, john, s, positive, qualities, observing, that, john, is, today, usually, considered, a, hard, working, administrator, an, able, man, an, able, general, nonetheless, modern, historians, agree, that, he, also, had, many, faults, as, king, including, what, historian, ralph, turner, describes, as, distasteful, even, dangerous, personality, traits, such, as, pettiness, spitefulness, and, cruelty, these, negative, qualities, provided, extensive, material, for, fiction, writers, in, the, victorian, era, and, john, remains, a, recurring, character, within, western, popular, culture, primarily, as, a, villain, in, robin, hood, folklore, john, was, born, on, 24, december, 1166, his, father, king, henry, ii, of, england, had, inherited, significant, territories, along, the, atlantic, seaboard, anjou, normandy, and, england, and, expanded, his, empire, by, conquering, brittany, john, s, mother, was, eleanor, the, powerful, duchess, of, aquitaine, who, had, a, tenuous, claim, to, toulouse, and, auvergne, in, southern, france, and, was, the, former, wife, of, king, louis, vii, of, france, the, territories, of, henry, and, eleanor, formed, the, angevin, empire, named, after, henry, s, paternal, title, as, count, of, anjou, and, more, specifically, its, seat, in, angers, the, empire, however, was, inherently, fragile, although, all, the, lands, owed, allegiance, to, henry, the, disparate, parts, each, had, their, own, histories, traditions, and, governance, structures, as, one, moved, south, through, anjou, and, aquitaine, the, extent, of, henry, s, power, in, the, provinces, diminished, considerably, scarcely, resembling, the, modern, concept, of, an, empire, at, all, some, of, the, traditional, ties, between, parts, of, the, empire, such, as, normandy, and, england, were, slowly, dissolving, over, time, the, future, of, the, empire, upon, henry, s, eventual, death, was, not, secure, although, the, custom, of, primogeniture, under, which, an, eldest, son, would, inherit, all, his, father, s, lands, was, slowly, becoming, more, widespread, across, europe, it, was, less, popular, amongst, the, norman, kings, of, england, most, believed, that, henry, would, divide, the, empire, giving, each, son, a, substantial, portion, and, hoping, that, his, children, would, continue, to, work, together, as, allies, after, his, death, to, complicate, matters, much, of, the, angevin, empire, was, held, by, henry, only, as, a, vassal, of, the, king, of, france, of, the, rival, line, of, the, house, of, capet, henry, had, often, allied, himself, with, the, holy, roman, emperor, against, france, making, the, feudal, relationship, even, more, challenging, shortly, after, his, birth, john, was, passed, from, eleanor, into, the, care, of, a, wet, nurse, a, traditional, practice, for, medieval, noble, families, eleanor, then, left, for, poitiers, the, capital, of, aquitaine, and, sent, john, and, his, sister, joan, north, to, fontevrault, abbey, this, may, have, been, done, with, the, aim, of, steering, her, youngest, son, with, no, obvious, inheritance, towards, a, future, ecclesiastical, career, eleanor, spent, the, next, few, years, conspiring, against, henry, and, neither, parent, played, a, part, in, john, s, very, early, life, john, was, probably, like, his, brothers, assigned, a, magister, whilst, he, was, at, fontevrault, a, teacher, charged, with, his, early, education, and, with, managing, the, servants, of, his, immediate, household, he, was, later, taught, by, ranulf, de, glanvill, a, leading, english, administrator, john, spent, some, time, as, a, member, of, the, household, of, his, eldest, living, brother, henry, the, young, king, where, he, probably, received, instruction, in, hunting, and, military, skills, john, grew, up, to, be, around, 5, ft, 5, in, 1, 65, m, tall, relatively, short, with, a, powerful, barrel, chested, body, and, dark, red, hair, he, looked, to, contemporaries, like, an, inhabitant, of, poitou, john, enjoyed, reading, and, unusually, for, the, period, built, up, a, travelling, library, of, books, he, enjoyed, gambling, in, particular, at, backgammon, and, was, an, enthusiastic, hunter, even, by, medieval, standards, he, liked, music, although, not, songs, john, would, become, a, connoisseur, of, jewels, building, up, a, large, collection, and, became, famous, for, his, opulent, clothes, and, also, according, to, french, chroniclers, for, his, fondness, for, bad, wine, as, john, grew, up, he, became, known, for, sometimes, being, genial, witty, generous, and, hospitable, at, other, moments, he, could, be, jealous, over, sensitive, and, prone, to, fits, of, rage, biting, and, gnawing, his, fingers, in, anger, during, john, s, early, years, henry, attempted, to, resolve, the, question, of, his, succession, henry, the, young, king, had, been, crowned, king, of, england, in, 1170, but, was, not, given, any, formal, powers, by, his, father, he, was, also, promised, normandy, and, anjou, as, part, of, his, future, inheritance, his, brother, richard, was, to, be, appointed, the, count, of, poitou, with, control, of, aquitaine, whilst, his, brother, geoffrey, was, to, become, the, duke, of, brittany, at, this, time, it, seemed, unlikely, that, john, would, ever, inherit, substantial, lands, and, he, was, jokingly, nicknamed, lackland, by, his, father, henry, ii, wanted, to, secure, the, southern, borders, of, aquitaine, and, decided, to, betroth, his, youngest, son, to, alais, the, daughter, and, heiress, of, humbert, iii, of, savoy, as, part, of, this, agreement, john, was, promised, the, future, inheritance, of, savoy, piedmont, maurienne, and, the, other, possessions, of, count, humbert, for, his, part, in, the, potential, marriage, alliance, henry, ii, transferred, the, castles, of, chinon, loudun, and, mirebeau, into, john, s, name, as, john, was, only, five, years, old, his, father, would, continue, to, control, them, for, practical, purposes, henry, the, young, king, was, unimpressed, by, this, although, he, had, yet, to, be, granted, control, of, any, castles, in, his, new, kingdom, these, were, effectively, his, future, property, and, had, been, given, away, without, consultation, alais, made, the, trip, over, the, alps, and, joined, henry, ii, s, court, but, she, died, before, marrying, john, which, left, the, prince, once, again, without, an, inheritance, in, 1173, john, s, elder, brothers, backed, by, eleanor, rose, in, revolt, against, henry, in, the, short, lived, rebellion, of, 1173, to, 1174, growing, irritated, with, his, subordinate, position, to, henry, ii, and, increasingly, worried, that, john, might, be, given, additional, lands, and, castles, at, his, expense, henry, the, young, king, travelled, to, paris, and, allied, himself, with, louis, vii, eleanor, irritated, by, her, husband, s, persistent, interference, in, aquitaine, encouraged, richard, and, geoffrey, to, join, their, brother, henry, in, paris, henry, ii, triumphed, over, the, coalition, of, his, sons, but, was, generous, to, them, in, the, peace, settlement, agreed, at, montlouis, henry, the, young, king, was, allowed, to, travel, widely, in, europe, with, his, own, household, of, knights, richard, was, given, aquitaine, back, and, geoffrey, was, allowed, to, return, to, brittany, only, eleanor, was, imprisoned, for, her, role, in, the, revolt, john, had, spent, the, conflict, travelling, alongside, his, father, and, was, given, widespread, possessions, across, the, angevin, empire, as, part, of, the, montlouis, settlement, from, then, onwards, most, observers, regarded, john, as, henry, ii, s, favourite, child, although, he, was, the, furthest, removed, in, terms, of, the, royal, succession, henry, ii, began, to, find, more, lands, for, john, mostly, at, various, nobles, expense, in, 1175, he, appropriated, the, estates, of, the, late, earl, of, cornwall, and, gave, them, to, john, the, following, year, henry, disinherited, the, sisters, of, isabella, of, gloucester, contrary, to, legal, custom, and, betrothed, john, to, the, now, extremely, wealthy, isabella, in, 1177, at, the, council, of, oxford, henry, dismissed, william, fitzaldelm, as, the, lord, of, ireland, and, replaced, him, with, the, ten, year, old, john, henry, the, young, king, fought, a, short, war, with, his, brother, richard, in, 1183, over, the, status, of, england, normandy, and, aquitaine, henry, ii, moved, in, support, of, richard, and, henry, the, young, king, died, from, dysentery, at, the, end, of, the, campaign, with, his, primary, heir, dead, henry, rearranged, the, plans, for, the, succession, richard, was, to, be, made, king, of, england, albeit, without, any, actual, power, until, the, death, of, his, father, geoffrey, would, retain, brittany, and, john, would, now, become, the, duke, of, aquitaine, in, place, of, richard, richard, refused, to, give, up, aquitaine, henry, ii, was, furious, and, ordered, john, with, help, from, geoffrey, to, march, south, and, retake, the, duchy, by, force, the, two, attacked, the, capital, of, poitiers, and, richard, responded, by, attacking, brittany, the, war, ended, in, stalemate, and, a, tense, family, reconciliation, in, england, at, the, end, of, 1184, in, 1185, john, made, his, first, visit, to, ireland, accompanied, by, 300, knights, and, a, team, of, administrators, henry, had, tried, to, have, john, officially, proclaimed, king, of, ireland, but, pope, lucius, iii, would, not, agree, john, s, first, period, of, rule, in, ireland, was, not, a, success, ireland, had, only, recently, been, conquered, by, anglo, norman, forces, and, tensions, were, still, rife, between, henry, ii, the, new, settlers, and, the, existing, inhabitants, john, infamously, offended, the, local, irish, rulers, by, making, fun, of, their, unfashionable, long, beards, failed, to, make, allies, amongst, the, anglo, norman, settlers, began, to, lose, ground, militarily, against, the, irish, and, finally, returned, to, england, later, in, the, year, blaming, the, viceroy, hugh, de, lacy, for, the, fiasco, the, problems, amongst, john, s, wider, family, continued, to, grow, his, elder, brother, geoffrey, died, during, a, tournament, in, 1186, leaving, a, posthumous, son, arthur, and, an, elder, daughter, eleanor, geoffrey, s, death, brought, john, slightly, closer, to, the, throne, of, england, the, uncertainty, about, what, would, happen, after, henry, s, death, continued, to, grow, richard, was, keen, to, join, a, new, crusade, and, remained, concerned, that, whilst, he, was, away, henry, would, appoint, john, his, formal, successor, richard, began, discussions, about, a, potential, alliance, with, philip, ii, in, paris, during, 1187, and, the, next, year, richard, gave, homage, to, philip, in, exchange, for, support, for, a, war, against, henry, richard, and, philip, fought, a, joint, campaign, against, henry, and, by, the, summer, of, 1189, henry, made, peace, promising, richard, the, succession, john, initially, remained, loyal, to, his, father, but, changed, sides, once, it, appeared, that, richard, would, win, henry, died, shortly, afterwards, when, richard, became, king, in, september, 1189, he, had, already, declared, his, intention, of, joining, the, third, crusade, he, set, about, raising, the, huge, sums, of, money, required, for, this, expedition, through, the, sale, of, lands, titles, and, appointments, and, attempted, to, ensure, that, he, would, not, face, a, revolt, while, away, from, his, empire, john, was, made, count, of, mortain, was, married, to, the, wealthy, isabella, of, gloucester, and, was, given, valuable, lands, in, lancaster, and, the, counties, of, cornwall, derby, devon, dorset, nottingham, and, somerset, all, with, the, aim, of, buying, his, loyalty, to, richard, whilst, the, king, was, on, crusade, richard, retained, royal, control, of, key, castles, in, these, counties, thereby, preventing, john, from, accumulating, too, much, military, and, political, power, the, king, named, his, four, year, old, nephew, arthur, as, his, heir, in, return, john, promised, not, to, visit, england, for, the, next, three, years, thereby, in, theory, giving, richard, adequate, time, to, conduct, a, successful, crusade, and, return, from, the, levant, without, fear, of, john, seizing, power, richard, left, political, authority, in, england, the, post, of, justiciar, jointly, in, the, hands, of, bishop, hugh, de, puiset, and, william, de, mandeville, 3rd, earl, of, essex, and, made, william, longchamp, the, bishop, of, ely, his, chancellor, mandeville, immediately, died, and, longchamp, took, over, as, joint, justiciar, with, puiset, which, would, prove, a, less, than, satisfactory, partnership, eleanor, the, queen, mother, convinced, richard, to, allow, john, into, england, in, his, absence, the, political, situation, in, england, rapidly, began, to, deteriorate, longchamp, refused, to, work, with, puiset, and, became, unpopular, with, the, english, nobility, and, clergy, john, exploited, this, unpopularity, to, set, himself, up, as, an, alternative, ruler, with, his, own, royal, court, complete, with, his, own, justiciar, chancellor, and, other, royal, posts, and, was, happy, to, be, portrayed, as, an, alternative, regent, and, possibly, the, next, king, armed, conflict, broke, out, between, john, and, longchamp, and, by, october, 1191, longchamp, was, isolated, in, the, tower, of, london, with, john, in, control, of, the, city, of, london, thanks, to, promises, john, had, made, to, the, citizens, in, return, for, recognition, as, richard, s, heir, presumptive, at, this, point, walter, of, coutances, the, archbishop, of, rouen, returned, to, england, having, been, sent, by, richard, to, restore, order, john, s, position, was, undermined, by, walter, s, relative, popularity, and, by, the, news, that, richard, had, married, whilst, in, cyprus, which, presented, the, possibility, that, richard, would, have, legitimate, children, and, heirs, the, political, turmoil, continued, john, began, to, explore, an, alliance, with, king, philip, ii, of, france, who, had, returned, from, the, crusade, in, late, 1191, john, hoped, to, acquire, normandy, anjou, and, the, other, lands, in, france, held, by, richard, in, exchange, for, allying, himself, with, philip, john, was, persuaded, not, to, pursue, an, alliance, by, his, mother, longchamp, who, had, left, england, after, walter, s, intervention, now, returned, and, argued, that, he, had, been, wrongly, removed, as, justiciar, john, intervened, suppressing, longchamp, s, claims, in, return, for, promises, of, support, from, the, royal, administration, including, a, reaffirmation, of, his, position, as, heir, to, the, throne, when, richard, still, did, not, return, from, the, crusade, john, began, to, assert, that, his, brother, was, dead, or, otherwise, permanently, lost, richard, had, in, fact, been, captured, shortly, before, christmas, 1192, while, en, route, to, england, by, duke, leopold, v, of, austria, and, was, handed, over, to, emperor, henry, vi, who, held, him, for, ransom, john, seized, the, opportunity, and, went, to, paris, where, he, formed, an, alliance, with, philip, he, agreed, to, set, aside, his, wife, isabella, of, gloucester, and, marry, philip, s, sister, alys, in, exchange, for, philip, s, support, fighting, broke, out, in, england, between, forces, loyal, to, richard, and, those, being, gathered, by, john, john, s, military, position, was, weak, and, he, agreed, to, a, truce, in, early, 1194, the, king, finally, returned, to, england, and, john, s, remaining, forces, surrendered, john, retreated, to, normandy, where, richard, finally, found, him, later, that, year, richard, declared, that, john, despite, being, 27, years, old, was, merely, a, child, who, has, had, evil, counsellors, and, forgave, him, but, removed, his, lands, with, the, exception, of, ireland, for, the, remaining, years, of, richard, s, reign, john, supported, his, brother, on, the, continent, apparently, loyally, richard, s, policy, on, the, continent, was, to, attempt, to, regain, through, steady, limited, campaigns, the, castles, he, had, lost, to, philip, ii, whilst, on, crusade, he, allied, himself, with, the, leaders, of, flanders, boulogne, and, the, holy, roman, empire, to, apply, pressure, on, philip, from, germany, in, 1195, john, successfully, conducted, a, sudden, attack, and, siege, of, vreux, castle, and, subsequently, managed, the, defences, of, normandy, against, philip, the, following, year, john, seized, the, town, of, gamaches, and, led, a, raiding, party, within, 50, miles, 80, km, of, paris, capturing, the, bishop, of, beauvais, in, return, for, this, service, richard, withdrew, his, malevolentia, ill, will, towards, john, restored, him, to, the, county, of, gloucestershire, and, made, him, again, the, count, of, mortain, after, richard, s, death, on, 6, april, 1199, there, were, two, potential, claimants, to, the, angevin, throne, john, whose, claim, rested, on, being, the, sole, surviving, son, of, henry, ii, and, young, arthur, i, of, brittany, who, held, a, claim, as, the, son, of, john, s, elder, brother, geoffrey, richard, appears, to, have, started, to, recognise, john, as, his, heir, presumptive, in, the, final, years, before, his, death, but, the, matter, was, not, clear, cut, and, medieval, law, gave, little, guidance, as, to, how, the, competing, claims, should, be, decided, with, norman, law, favouring, john, as, the, only, surviving, son, of, henry, ii, and, angevin, law, favouring, arthur, as, the, only, son, of, henry, s, elder, son, the, matter, rapidly, became, an, open, conflict, john, was, supported, by, the, bulk, of, the, english, and, norman, nobility, and, was, crowned, at, westminster, abbey, backed, by, his, mother, eleanor, arthur, was, supported, by, the, majority, of, the, breton, maine, and, anjou, nobles, and, received, the, support, of, philip, ii, who, remained, committed, to, breaking, up, the, angevin, territories, on, the, continent, with, arthur, s, army, pressing, up, the, loire, valley, towards, angers, and, philip, s, forces, moving, down, the, valley, towards, tours, john, s, continental, empire, was, in, danger, of, being, cut, in, two, warfare, in, normandy, at, the, time, was, shaped, by, the, defensive, potential, of, castles, and, the, increasing, costs, of, conducting, campaigns, the, norman, frontiers, had, limited, natural, defences, but, were, heavily, reinforced, with, castles, such, as, ch, teau, gaillard, at, strategic, points, built, and, maintained, at, considerable, expense, it, was, difficult, for, a, commander, to, advance, far, into, fresh, territory, without, having, secured, his, lines, of, communication, by, capturing, these, fortifications, which, slowed, the, progress, of, any, attack, armies, of, the, period, could, be, formed, from, either, feudal, or, mercenary, forces, feudal, levies, could, be, raised, only, for, a, fixed, length, of, time, before, they, returned, home, forcing, an, end, to, a, campaign, mercenary, forces, often, called, braban, ons, after, the, duchy, of, brabant, but, actually, recruited, from, across, northern, europe, could, operate, all, year, long, and, provide, a, commander, with, more, strategic, options, to, pursue, a, campaign, but, cost, much, more, than, equivalent, feudal, forces, as, a, result, commanders, of, the, period, were, increasingly, drawing, on, larger, numbers, of, mercenaries, after, his, coronation, john, moved, south, into, france, with, military, forces, and, adopted, a, defensive, posture, along, the, eastern, and, southern, normandy, borders, both, sides, paused, for, desultory, negotiations, before, the, war, recommenced, john, s, position, was, now, stronger, thanks, to, confirmation, that, the, counts, baldwin, ix, of, flanders, and, renaud, of, boulogne, had, renewed, the, anti, french, alliances, they, had, previously, agreed, to, with, richard, the, powerful, anjou, nobleman, william, des, roches, was, persuaded, to, switch, sides, from, arthur, to, john, suddenly, the, balance, seemed, to, be, tipping, away, from, philip, and, arthur, in, favour, of, john, neither, side, was, keen, to, continue, the, conflict, and, following, a, papal, truce, the, two, leaders, met, in, january, 1200, to, negotiate, possible, terms, for, peace, from, john, s, perspective, what, then, followed, represented, an, opportunity, to, stabilise, control, over, his, continental, possessions, and, produce, a, lasting, peace, with, philip, in, paris, john, and, philip, negotiated, the, may, 1200, treaty, of, le, goulet, by, this, treaty, philip, recognised, john, as, the, rightful, heir, to, richard, in, respect, to, his, french, possessions, temporarily, abandoning, the, wider, claims, of, his, client, arthur, john, in, turn, abandoned, richard, s, former, policy, of, containing, philip, through, alliances, with, flanders, and, boulogne, and, accepted, philip, s, right, as, the, legitimate, feudal, overlord, of, john, s, lands, in, france, john, s, policy, earned, him, the, disrespectful, title, of, john, softsword, from, some, english, chroniclers, who, contrasted, his, behaviour, with, his, more, aggressive, brother, richard, the, new, peace, would, last, only, two, years, war, recommenced, in, the, aftermath, of, john, s, decision, in, august, 1200, to, marry, isabella, of, angoul, me, in, order, to, remarry, john, first, needed, to, abandon, his, wife, isabella, countess, of, gloucester, the, king, accomplished, this, by, arguing, that, he, had, failed, to, get, the, necessary, papal, dispensation, to, marry, the, countess, in, the, first, place, as, a, cousin, john, could, not, have, legally, wedded, her, without, this, it, remains, unclear, why, john, chose, to, marry, isabella, of, angoul, me, contemporary, chroniclers, argued, that, john, had, fallen, deeply, in, love, with, her, and, john, may, have, been, motivated, by, desire, for, an, apparently, beautiful, if, rather, young, girl, isabella, of, angoul, me, was, either, 12, or, 14, at, the, time, of, their, marriage, on, the, other, hand, the, angoumois, lands, that, came, with, her, were, strategically, vital, to, john, by, marrying, isabella, john, was, acquiring, a, key, land, route, between, poitou, and, gascony, which, significantly, strengthened, his, grip, on, aquitaine, isabella, however, was, already, engaged, to, hugh, ix, of, lusignan, an, important, member, of, a, key, poitou, noble, family, and, brother, of, raoul, i, count, of, eu, who, possessed, lands, along, the, sensitive, eastern, normandy, border, just, as, john, stood, to, benefit, strategically, from, marrying, isabella, so, the, marriage, threatened, the, interests, of, the, lusignans, whose, own, lands, currently, provided, the, key, route, for, royal, goods, and, troops, across, aquitaine, rather, than, negotiating, some, form, of, compensation, john, treated, hugh, with, contempt, this, resulted, in, a, lusignan, uprising, that, was, promptly, crushed, by, john, who, also, intervened, to, suppress, raoul, in, normandy, although, john, was, the, count, of, poitou, and, therefore, the, rightful, feudal, lord, over, the, lusignans, they, could, legitimately, appeal, john, s, actions, in, france, to, his, own, feudal, lord, philip, hugh, did, exactly, this, in, 1201, and, philip, summoned, john, to, attend, court, in, paris, in, 1202, citing, the, le, goulet, treaty, to, strengthen, his, case, john, was, unwilling, to, weaken, his, authority, in, western, france, in, this, way, he, argued, that, he, need, not, attend, philip, s, court, because, of, his, special, status, as, the, duke, of, normandy, who, was, exempt, by, feudal, tradition, from, being, called, to, the, french, court, philip, argued, that, he, was, summoning, john, not, as, the, duke, of, normandy, but, as, the, count, of, poitou, which, carried, no, such, special, status, when, john, still, refused, to, come, philip, declared, john, in, breach, of, his, feudal, responsibilities, reassigned, all, of, john, s, lands, that, fell, under, the, french, crown, to, arthur, with, the, exception, of, normandy, which, he, took, back, for, himself, and, began, a, fresh, war, against, john, john, initially, adopted, a, defensive, posture, similar, to, that, of, 1199, avoiding, open, battle, and, carefully, defending, his, key, castles, john, s, operations, became, more, chaotic, as, the, campaign, progressed, and, philip, began, to, make, steady, progress, in, the, east, john, became, aware, in, july, that, arthur, s, forces, were, threatening, his, mother, eleanor, at, mirebeau, castle, accompanied, by, william, de, roches, his, seneschal, in, anjou, he, swung, his, mercenary, army, rapidly, south, to, protect, her, his, forces, caught, arthur, by, surprise, and, captured, the, entire, rebel, leadership, at, the, battle, of, mirebeau, with, his, southern, flank, weakening, philip, was, forced, to, withdraw, in, the, east, and, turn, south, himself, to, contain, john, s, army, john, s, position, in, france, was, considerably, strengthened, by, the, victory, at, mirebeau, but, john, s, treatment, of, his, new, prisoners, and, of, his, ally, william, de, roches, quickly, undermined, these, gains, de, roches, was, a, powerful, anjou, noble, but, john, largely, ignored, him, causing, considerable, offence, whilst, the, king, kept, the, rebel, leaders, in, such, bad, conditions, that, twenty, two, of, them, died, at, this, time, most, of, the, regional, nobility, were, closely, linked, through, kinship, and, this, behaviour, towards, their, relatives, was, regarded, as, unacceptable, william, de, roches, and, others, of, john, s, regional, allies, in, anjou, and, brittany, deserted, him, in, favour, of, philip, and, brittany, rose, in, revolt, john, s, financial, situation, was, tenuous, once, factors, such, as, the, comparative, military, costs, of, materiel, and, soldiers, were, taken, into, account, while, philip, enjoyed, a, considerable, although, not, overwhelming, advantage, of, resources, over, john, further, desertions, of, john, s, local, allies, at, the, beginning, of, 1203, steadily, reduced, his, freedom, to, manoeuvre, in, the, region, he, attempted, to, convince, pope, innocent, iii, to, intervene, in, the, conflict, but, innocent, s, efforts, were, unsuccessful, as, the, situation, became, worse, for, john, he, appears, to, have, decided, to, have, arthur, killed, with, the, aim, of, removing, a, potential, rival, and, to, undermine, the, rebel, forces, in, brittany, arthur, had, initially, been, imprisoned, at, falaise, and, was, then, moved, to, rouen, after, this, arthur, s, fate, remains, uncertain, but, modern, historians, believe, he, was, murdered, by, john, the, annals, of, margam, abbey, suggest, that, john, had, captured, arthur, and, kept, him, alive, in, prison, for, some, time, in, the, castle, of, rouen, when, john, was, drunk, he, slew, arthur, with, his, own, hand, and, tying, a, heavy, stone, to, the, body, cast, it, into, the, seine, rumours, of, the, manner, of, arthur, s, death, further, reduced, support, for, john, across, the, region, arthur, s, sister, eleanor, who, had, also, been, captured, at, mirebeau, was, kept, imprisoned, by, john, for, many, years, albeit, in, relatively, good, conditions, in, late, 1203, john, attempted, to, relieve, ch, teau, gaillard, which, although, besieged, by, philip, was, guarding, the, eastern, flank, of, normandy, john, attempted, a, synchronised, operation, involving, land, based, and, water, borne, forces, considered, by, most, historians, today, to, have, been, imaginative, in, conception, but, overly, complex, for, forces, of, the, period, to, have, carried, out, successfully, john, s, relief, operation, was, blocked, by, philip, s, forces, and, john, turned, back, to, brittany, in, an, attempt, to, draw, philip, away, from, eastern, normandy, john, successfully, devastated, much, of, brittany, but, did, not, deflect, philip, s, main, thrust, into, the, east, of, normandy, opinions, vary, amongst, historians, as, to, the, military, skill, shown, by, john, during, this, campaign, with, most, recent, historians, arguing, that, his, performance, was, passable, although, not, impressive, john, s, situation, began, to, deteriorate, rapidly, the, eastern, border, region, of, normandy, had, been, extensively, cultivated, by, philip, and, his, predecessors, for, several, years, whilst, angevin, authority, in, the, south, had, been, undermined, by, richard, s, giving, away, of, various, key, castles, some, years, before, his, use, of, routier, mercenaries, in, the, central, regions, had, rapidly, eaten, away, his, remaining, support, in, this, area, too, which, set, the, stage, for, a, sudden, collapse, of, angevin, power, john, retreated, back, across, the, channel, in, december, sending, orders, for, the, establishment, of, a, fresh, defensive, line, to, the, west, of, chateau, gaillard, in, march, 1204, gaillard, fell, john, s, mother, eleanor, died, the, following, month, this, was, not, just, a, personal, blow, for, john, but, threatened, to, unravel, the, widespread, angevin, alliances, across, the, far, south, of, france, philip, moved, south, around, the, new, defensive, line, and, struck, upwards, at, the, heart, of, the, duchy, now, facing, little, resistance, by, august, philip, had, taken, normandy, and, advanced, south, to, occupy, anjou, and, poitou, as, well, john, s, only, remaining, possession, on, the, continent, was, now, the, duchy, of, aquitaine, the, nature, of, government, under, the, angevin, monarchs, was, ill, defined, and, uncertain, john, s, predecessors, had, ruled, using, the, principle, of, vis, et, voluntas, force, and, will, taking, executive, and, sometimes, arbitrary, decisions, often, justified, on, the, basis, that, a, king, was, above, the, law, both, henry, ii, and, richard, had, argued, that, kings, possessed, a, quality, of, divine, majesty, john, continued, this, trend, and, claimed, an, almost, imperial, status, for, himself, as, ruler, during, the, 12th, century, there, were, contrary, opinions, expressed, about, the, nature, of, kingship, and, many, contemporary, writers, believed, that, monarchs, should, rule, in, accordance, with, the, custom, and, the, law, and, take, counsel, of, the, leading, members, of, the, realm, there, was, as, yet, no, model, for, what, should, happen, if, a, king, refused, to, do, so, despite, his, claim, to, unique, authority, within, england, john, would, sometimes, justify, his, actions, on, the, basis, that, he, had, taken, council, with, the, barons, modern, historians, remain, divided, as, to, whether, john, had, a, case, of, royal, schizophrenia, in, his, approach, to, government, or, if, his, actions, merely, reflected, the, complex, model, of, angevin, kingship, in, the, early, 13th, century, john, inherited, a, sophisticated, system, of, administration, in, england, with, a, range, of, royal, agents, answering, to, the, royal, household, the, chancery, kept, written, records, and, communications, the, treasury, and, the, exchequer, dealt, with, income, and, expenditure, respectively, and, various, judges, were, deployed, to, deliver, justice, around, the, kingdom, thanks, to, the, efforts, of, men, like, hubert, walter, this, trend, towards, improved, record, keeping, continued, into, his, reign, like, previous, kings, john, managed, a, peripatetic, court, that, travelled, around, the, kingdom, dealing, with, both, local, and, national, matters, as, he, went, john, was, very, active, in, the, administration, of, england, and, was, involved, in, every, aspect, of, government, in, part, he, was, following, in, the, tradition, of, henry, i, and, henry, ii, but, by, the, 13th, century, the, volume, of, administrative, work, had, greatly, increased, which, put, much, more, pressure, on, a, king, who, wished, to, rule, in, this, style, john, was, in, england, for, much, longer, periods, than, his, predecessors, which, made, his, rule, more, personal, than, that, of, previous, kings, particularly, in, previously, ignored, areas, such, as, the, north, the, administration, of, justice, was, of, particular, importance, to, john, several, new, processes, had, been, introduced, to, english, law, under, henry, ii, including, novel, disseisin, and, mort, d, ancestor, these, processes, meant, the, royal, courts, had, a, more, significant, role, in, local, law, cases, which, had, previously, been, dealt, with, only, by, regional, or, local, lords, john, increased, the, professionalism, of, local, sergeants, and, bailiffs, and, extended, the, system, of, coroners, first, introduced, by, hubert, walter, in, 1194, creating, a, new, class, of, borough, coroners, the, king, worked, extremely, hard, to, ensure, that, this, system, operated, well, through, judges, he, had, appointed, by, fostering, legal, specialists, and, expertise, and, by, intervening, in, cases, himself, he, continued, to, try, relatively, minor, cases, even, during, military, crises, viewed, positively, lewis, warren, considers, that, john, discharged, his, royal, duty, of, providing, justice, with, a, zeal, and, a, tirelessness, to, which, the, english, common, law, is, greatly, endebted, seen, more, critically, john, may, have, been, motivated, by, the, potential, of, the, royal, legal, process, to, raise, fees, rather, than, a, desire, to, deliver, simple, justice, his, legal, system, also, applied, only, to, free, men, rather, than, to, all, of, the, population, nonetheless, these, changes, were, popular, with, many, free, tenants, who, acquired, a, more, reliable, legal, system, that, could, bypass, the, barons, against, whom, such, cases, were, often, brought, john, s, reforms, were, less, popular, with, the, barons, themselves, especially, as, they, remained, subject, to, arbitrary, and, frequently, vindictive, royal, justice, one, of, john, s, principal, challenges, was, acquiring, the, large, sums, of, money, needed, for, his, proposed, campaigns, to, reclaim, normandy, the, angevin, kings, had, three, main, sources, of, income, available, to, them, namely, revenue, from, their, personal, lands, or, demesne, money, raised, through, their, rights, as, a, feudal, lord, and, revenue, from, taxation, revenue, from, the, royal, demesne, was, inflexible, and, had, been, diminishing, slowly, since, the, norman, conquest, matters, were, not, helped, by, richard, s, sale, of, many, royal, properties, in, 1189, and, taxation, played, a, much, smaller, role, in, royal, income, than, in, later, centuries, english, kings, had, widespread, feudal, rights, which, could, be, used, to, generate, income, including, the, scutage, system, in, which, feudal, military, service, was, avoided, by, a, cash, payment, to, the, king, he, derived, income, from, fines, court, fees, and, the, sale, of, charters, and, other, privileges, john, intensified, his, efforts, to, maximise, all, possible, sources, of, income, to, the, extent, that, he, has, been, described, as, avaricious, miserly, extortionate, and, moneyminded, he, also, used, revenue, generation, as, a, way, of, exerting, political, control, over, the, barons, debts, owed, to, the, crown, by, the, king, s, favoured, supporters, might, be, forgiven, collection, of, those, owed, by, enemies, was, more, stringently, enforced, the, result, was, a, sequence, of, innovative, but, unpopular, financial, measures, john, levied, scutage, payments, eleven, times, in, his, seventeen, years, as, king, as, compared, to, eleven, times, in, total, during, the, reign, of, the, preceding, three, monarchs, in, many, cases, these, were, levied, in, the, absence, of, any, actual, military, campaign, which, ran, counter, to, the, original, idea, that, scutage, was, an, alternative, to, actual, military, service, john, maximised, his, right, to, demand, relief, payments, when, estates, and, castles, were, inherited, sometimes, charging, enormous, sums, beyond, barons, abilities, to, pay, building, on, the, successful, sale, of, sheriff, appointments, in, 1194, the, king, initiated, a, new, round, of, appointments, with, the, new, incumbents, making, back, their, investment, through, increased, fines, and, penalties, particularly, in, the, forests, another, innovation, of, richard, s, increased, charges, levied, on, widows, who, wished, to, remain, single, was, expanded, under, john, john, continued, to, sell, charters, for, new, towns, including, the, planned, town, of, liverpool, and, charters, were, sold, for, markets, across, the, kingdom, and, in, gascony, the, king, introduced, new, taxes, and, extended, existing, ones, the, jews, who, held, a, vulnerable, position, in, medieval, england, protected, only, by, the, king, were, subject, to, huge, taxes, 44, 000, was, extracted, from, the, community, by, the, tallage, of, 1210, much, of, it, was, passed, on, to, the, christian, debtors, of, jewish, moneylenders, john, created, a, new, tax, on, income, and, movable, goods, in, 1207, effectively, a, version, of, a, modern, income, tax, that, produced, 60, 000, he, created, a, new, set, of, import, and, export, duties, payable, directly, to, the, crown, he, found, that, these, measures, enabled, him, to, raise, further, resources, through, the, confiscation, of, the, lands, of, barons, who, could, not, pay, or, refused, to, pay, at, the, start, of, john, s, reign, there, was, a, sudden, change, in, prices, as, bad, harvests, and, high, demand, for, food, resulted, in, much, higher, prices, for, grain, and, animals, this, inflationary, pressure, was, to, continue, for, the, rest, of, the, 13th, century, and, had, long, term, economic, consequences, for, england, the, resulting, social, pressures, were, complicated, by, bursts, of, deflation, that, resulted, from, john, s, military, campaigns, it, was, usual, at, the, time, for, the, king, to, collect, taxes, in, silver, which, was, then, re, minted, into, new, coins, these, coins, would, then, be, put, in, barrels, and, sent, to, royal, castles, around, the, country, to, be, used, to, hire, mercenaries, or, to, meet, other, costs, at, those, times, when, john, was, preparing, for, campaigns, in, normandy, for, example, huge, quantities, of, silver, had, to, be, withdrawn, from, the, economy, and, stored, for, months, which, unintentionally, resulted, in, periods, during, which, silver, coins, were, simply, hard, to, come, by, commercial, credit, difficult, to, acquire, and, deflationary, pressure, placed, on, the, economy, the, result, was, political, unrest, across, the, country, john, attempted, to, address, some, of, the, problems, with, the, english, currency, in, 1204, and, 1205, by, carrying, out, a, radical, overhaul, of, the, coinage, improving, its, quality, and, consistency, john, s, royal, household, was, based, around, several, groups, of, followers, one, group, was, the, familiares, regis, his, immediate, friends, and, knights, who, travelled, around, the, country, with, him, they, also, played, an, important, role, in, organising, and, leading, military, campaigns, another, section, of, royal, followers, were, the, curia, regis, these, curiales, were, the, senior, officials, and, agents, of, the, king, and, were, essential, to, his, day, to, day, rule, being, a, member, of, these, inner, circles, brought, huge, advantages, as, it, was, easier, to, gain, favours, from, the, king, file, lawsuits, marry, a, wealthy, heiress, or, have, one, s, debts, remitted, by, the, time, of, henry, ii, these, posts, were, increasingly, being, filled, by, new, men, from, outside, the, normal, ranks, of, the, barons, this, intensified, under, john, s, rule, with, many, lesser, nobles, arriving, from, the, continent, to, take, up, positions, at, court, many, were, mercenary, leaders, from, poitou, these, men, included, soldiers, who, would, become, infamous, in, england, for, their, uncivilised, behaviour, including, falkes, de, breaut, g, rard, d, ath, e, engelard, de, cigogn, and, philip, marc, many, barons, perceived, the, king, s, household, as, what, ralph, turner, has, characterised, as, a, narrow, clique, enjoying, royal, favour, at, barons, expense, staffed, by, men, of, lesser, status, this, trend, for, the, king, to, rely, on, his, own, men, at, the, expense, of, the, barons, was, exacerbated, by, the, tradition, of, angevin, royal, ira, et, malevolentia, anger, and, ill, will, and, john, s, own, personality, from, henry, ii, onwards, ira, et, malevolentia, had, come, to, describe, the, right, of, the, king, to, express, his, anger, and, displeasure, at, particular, barons, or, clergy, building, on, the, norman, concept, of, malevolentia, royal, ill, will, in, the, norman, period, suffering, the, king, s, ill, will, meant, difficulties, in, obtaining, grants, honours, or, petitions, henry, ii, had, infamously, expressed, his, fury, and, ill, will, towards, thomas, becket, which, ultimately, resulted, in, becket, s, death, john, now, had, the, additional, ability, to, cripple, his, vassals, on, a, significant, scale, using, his, new, economic, and, judicial, measures, which, made, the, threat, of, royal, anger, all, the, more, serious, john, was, deeply, suspicious, of, the, barons, particularly, those, with, sufficient, power, and, wealth, to, potentially, challenge, him, numerous, barons, were, subjected, to, his, malevolentia, even, including, the, famous, knight, william, marshal, 1st, earl, of, pembroke, normally, held, up, as, a, model, of, utter, loyalty, the, most, infamous, case, which, went, beyond, anything, considered, acceptable, at, the, time, was, that, of, the, powerful, william, de, braose, 4th, lord, of, bramber, who, held, lands, in, ireland, de, braose, was, subjected, to, punitive, demands, for, money, and, when, he, refused, to, pay, a, huge, sum, of, 40, 000, marks, equivalent, to, 26, 666, at, the, time, his, wife, maud, and, one, of, their, sons, were, imprisoned, by, john, which, resulted, in, their, deaths, de, braose, died, in, exile, in, 1211, and, his, grandsons, remained, in, prison, until, 1218, john, s, suspicions, and, jealousies, meant, that, he, rarely, enjoyed, good, relationships, with, even, the, leading, loyalist, barons, john, s, personal, life, greatly, affected, his, reign, contemporary, chroniclers, state, that, john, was, sinfully, lustful, and, lacking, in, piety, it, was, common, for, kings, and, nobles, of, the, period, to, keep, mistresses, but, chroniclers, complained, that, john, s, mistresses, were, married, noblewomen, which, was, considered, unacceptable, john, had, at, least, five, children, with, mistresses, during, his, first, marriage, and, two, of, those, mistresses, are, known, to, have, been, noblewomen, john, s, sexual, behaviour, after, his, second, marriage, is, less, clear, however, none, of, his, known, illegitimate, children, were, born, after, he, remarried, and, there, is, no, actual, documentary, proof, of, adultery, after, that, point, although, john, certainly, had, female, friends, amongst, the, court, throughout, the, period, the, specific, accusations, made, against, john, during, the, baronial, revolts, are, now, generally, considered, to, have, been, invented, for, the, purposes, of, justifying, the, revolt, nonetheless, most, of, john, s, contemporaries, seem, to, have, held, a, poor, opinion, of, his, sexual, behaviour, the, character, of, john, s, relationship, with, his, second, wife, isabella, of, angoul, me, is, unclear, john, married, isabella, whilst, she, was, relatively, young, her, exact, date, of, birth, is, uncertain, and, estimates, place, her, between, at, most, 15, and, more, probably, towards, nine, years, old, at, the, time, of, her, marriage, even, by, the, standards, of, the, time, she, was, married, whilst, very, young, john, did, not, provide, a, great, deal, of, money, for, his, wife, s, household, and, did, not, pass, on, much, of, the, revenue, from, her, lands, to, the, extent, that, historian, nicholas, vincent, has, described, him, as, being, downright, mean, towards, isabella, vincent, concluded, that, the, marriage, was, not, a, particularly, amicable, one, other, aspects, of, their, marriage, suggest, a, closer, more, positive, relationship, chroniclers, recorded, that, john, had, a, mad, infatuation, with, isabella, and, certainly, the, king, and, queen, had, conjugal, relations, between, at, least, 1207, and, 1215, they, had, five, children, in, contrast, to, vincent, historian, william, chester, jordan, concludes, that, the, pair, were, a, companionable, couple, who, had, a, successful, marriage, by, the, standards, of, the, day, john, s, lack, of, religious, conviction, has, been, noted, by, contemporary, chroniclers, and, later, historians, with, some, suspecting, that, he, was, at, best, impious, or, even, atheistic, a, very, serious, issue, at, the, time, contemporary, chroniclers, catalogued, his, various, anti, religious, habits, at, length, including, his, failure, to, take, communion, his, blasphemous, remarks, and, his, witty, but, scandalous, jokes, about, church, doctrine, including, jokes, about, the, implausibility, of, the, resurrection, of, jesus, they, commented, on, the, paucity, of, john, s, charitable, donations, to, the, church, historian, frank, mclynn, argues, that, john, s, early, years, at, fontevrault, combined, with, his, relatively, advanced, education, may, have, turned, him, against, the, church, other, historians, have, been, more, cautious, in, interpreting, this, material, noting, that, chroniclers, also, reported, his, personal, interest, in, the, life, of, st, wulfstan, and, his, friendships, with, several, senior, clerics, most, especially, with, hugh, of, lincoln, who, was, later, declared, a, saint, financial, records, show, a, normal, royal, household, engaged, in, the, usual, feasts, and, pious, observances, albeit, with, many, records, showing, john, s, offerings, to, the, poor, to, atone, for, routinely, breaking, church, rules, and, guidance, the, historian, lewis, warren, has, argued, that, the, chronicler, accounts, were, subject, to, considerable, bias, and, the, king, was, at, least, conventionally, devout, citing, his, pilgrimages, and, interest, in, religious, scripture, and, commentaries, during, the, remainder, of, his, reign, john, focused, on, trying, to, retake, normandy, the, available, evidence, suggests, that, he, did, not, regard, the, loss, of, the, duchy, as, a, permanent, shift, in, capetian, power, strategically, john, faced, several, challenges, england, itself, had, to, be, secured, against, possible, french, invasion, the, sea, routes, to, bordeaux, needed, to, be, secured, following, the, loss, of, the, land, route, to, aquitaine, and, his, remaining, possessions, in, aquitaine, needed, to, be, secured, following, the, death, of, his, mother, eleanor, in, april, 1204, john, s, preferred, plan, was, to, use, poitou, as, a, base, of, operations, advance, up, the, loire, valley, to, threaten, paris, pin, down, the, french, forces, and, break, philip, s, internal, lines, of, communication, before, landing, a, maritime, force, in, the, duchy, itself, ideally, this, plan, would, benefit, from, the, opening, of, a, second, front, on, philip, s, eastern, frontiers, with, flanders, and, boulogne, effectively, a, re, creation, of, richard, s, old, strategy, of, applying, pressure, from, germany, all, of, this, would, require, a, great, deal, of, money, and, soldiers, john, spent, much, of, 1205, securing, england, against, a, potential, french, invasion, as, an, emergency, measure, he, recreated, a, version, of, henry, ii, s, assize, of, arms, of, 1181, with, each, shire, creating, a, structure, to, mobilise, local, levies, when, the, threat, of, invasion, faded, john, formed, a, large, military, force, in, england, intended, for, poitou, and, a, large, fleet, with, soldiers, under, his, own, command, intended, for, normandy, to, achieve, this, john, reformed, the, english, feudal, contribution, to, his, campaigns, creating, a, more, flexible, system, under, which, only, one, knight, in, ten, would, actually, be, mobilised, but, would, be, financially, supported, by, the, other, nine, knights, would, serve, for, an, indefinite, period, john, built, up, a, strong, team, of, engineers, for, siege, warfare, and, a, substantial, force, of, professional, crossbowmen, the, king, was, supported, by, a, team, of, leading, barons, with, military, expertise, including, william, longesp, e, 3rd, earl, of, salisbury, william, the, marshal, roger, de, lacy, and, until, he, fell, from, favour, the, marcher, lord, william, de, braose, john, had, already, begun, to, improve, his, channel, forces, before, the, loss, of, normandy, and, he, rapidly, built, up, further, maritime, capabilities, after, its, collapse, most, of, these, ships, were, placed, along, the, cinque, ports, but, portsmouth, was, also, enlarged, by, the, end, of, 1204, he, had, around, 50, large, galleys, available, another, 54, vessels, were, built, between, 1209, and, 1212, william, of, wrotham, was, appointed, keeper, of, the, galleys, effectively, john, s, chief, admiral, wrotham, was, responsible, for, fusing, john, s, galleys, the, ships, of, the, cinque, ports, and, pressed, merchant, vessels, into, a, single, operational, fleet, john, adopted, recent, improvements, in, ship, design, including, new, large, transport, ships, called, buisses, and, removable, forecastles, for, use, in, combat, baronial, unrest, in, england, prevented, the, departure, of, the, planned, 1205, expedition, and, only, a, smaller, force, under, william, longesp, e, deployed, to, poitou, in, 1206, john, departed, for, poitou, himself, but, was, forced, to, divert, south, to, counter, a, threat, to, gascony, from, alfonso, viii, of, castile, after, a, successful, campaign, against, alfonso, john, headed, north, again, taking, the, city, of, angers, philip, moved, south, to, meet, john, the, year, s, campaigning, ended, in, stalemate, and, a, two, year, truce, was, made, between, the, two, rulers, during, the, truce, of, 1206, 1208, john, focused, on, building, up, his, financial, and, military, resources, in, preparation, for, another, attempt, to, recapture, normandy, john, used, some, of, this, money, to, pay, for, new, alliances, on, philip, s, eastern, frontiers, where, the, growth, in, capetian, power, was, beginning, to, concern, france, s, neighbours, by, 1212, john, had, successfully, concluded, alliances, with, his, nephew, otto, iv, a, contender, for, the, crown, of, holy, roman, emperor, in, germany, as, well, as, with, the, counts, renaud, of, boulogne, and, ferdinand, of, flanders, the, invasion, plans, for, 1212, were, postponed, because, of, fresh, english, baronial, unrest, about, service, in, poitou, philip, seized, the, initiative, in, 1213, sending, his, elder, son, louis, to, invade, flanders, with, the, intention, of, next, launching, an, invasion, of, england, john, was, forced, to, postpone, his, own, invasion, plans, to, counter, this, threat, he, launched, his, new, fleet, to, attack, the, french, at, the, harbour, of, damme, the, attack, was, a, success, destroying, philip, s, vessels, and, any, chances, of, an, invasion, of, england, that, year, john, hoped, to, exploit, this, advantage, by, invading, himself, late, in, 1213, but, baronial, discontent, again, delayed, his, invasion, plans, until, early, 1214, in, what, was, his, final, continental, campaign, in, the, late, 12th, and, early, 13th, centuries, the, border, and, political, relationship, between, england, and, scotland, was, disputed, with, the, kings, of, scotland, claiming, parts, of, what, is, now, northern, england, john, s, father, henry, ii, had, forced, william, the, lion, to, swear, fealty, to, him, at, the, treaty, of, falaise, in, 1174, this, had, been, rescinded, by, richard, i, in, exchange, for, financial, compensation, in, 1189, but, the, relationship, remained, uneasy, john, began, his, reign, by, reasserting, his, sovereignty, over, the, disputed, northern, counties, he, refused, william, s, request, for, the, earldom, of, northumbria, but, did, not, intervene, in, scotland, itself, and, focused, on, his, continental, problems, the, two, kings, maintained, a, friendly, relationship, meeting, in, 1206, and, 1207, until, it, was, rumoured, in, 1209, that, william, was, intending, to, ally, himself, with, philip, ii, of, france, john, invaded, scotland, and, forced, william, to, sign, the, treaty, of, norham, which, gave, john, control, of, william, s, daughters, and, required, a, payment, of, 10, 000, this, effectively, crippled, william, s, power, north, of, the, border, and, by, 1212, john, had, to, intervene, militarily, to, support, william, against, his, internal, rivals, john, made, no, efforts, to, reinvigorate, the, treaty, of, falaise, though, and, william, and, his, son, alexander, ii, of, scotland, in, turn, remained, independent, kings, supported, by, but, not, owing, fealty, to, john, john, remained, lord, of, ireland, throughout, his, reign, he, drew, on, the, country, for, resources, to, fight, his, war, with, philip, on, the, continent, conflict, continued, in, ireland, between, the, anglo, norman, settlers, and, the, indigenous, irish, chieftains, with, john, manipulating, both, groups, to, expand, his, wealth, and, power, in, the, country, during, richard, s, rule, john, had, successfully, increased, the, size, of, his, lands, in, ireland, and, he, continued, this, policy, as, king, in, 1210, the, king, crossed, into, ireland, with, a, large, army, to, crush, a, rebellion, by, the, anglo, norman, lords, he, reasserted, his, control, of, the, country, and, used, a, new, charter, to, order, compliance, with, english, laws, and, customs, in, ireland, john, stopped, short, of, trying, to, actively, enforce, this, charter, on, the, native, irish, kingdoms, but, historian, david, carpenter, suspects, that, he, might, have, done, so, had, the, baronial, conflict, in, england, not, intervened, simmering, tensions, remained, with, the, native, irish, leaders, even, after, john, left, for, england, royal, power, in, wales, was, unevenly, applied, with, the, country, divided, between, the, marcher, lords, along, the, borders, royal, territories, in, pembrokeshire, and, the, more, independent, native, welsh, lords, of, north, wales, john, took, a, close, interest, in, wales, and, knew, the, country, well, visiting, every, year, between, 1204, and, 1211, and, marrying, his, illegitimate, daughter, joan, to, the, welsh, prince, llywelyn, the, great, the, king, used, the, marcher, lords, and, the, native, welsh, to, increase, his, own, territory, and, power, striking, a, sequence, of, increasingly, precise, deals, backed, by, royal, military, power, with, the, welsh, rulers, a, major, royal, expedition, to, enforce, these, agreements, occurred, in, 1211, after, llywelyn, attempted, to, exploit, the, instability, caused, by, the, removal, of, william, de, braose, through, the, welsh, uprising, of, 1211, john, s, invasion, striking, into, the, welsh, heartlands, was, a, military, success, llywelyn, came, to, terms, that, included, an, expansion, of, john, s, power, across, much, of, wales, albeit, only, temporarily, when, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, hubert, walter, died, on, 13, july, 1205, john, became, involved, in, a, dispute, with, pope, innocent, iii, that, would, lead, to, the, king, s, excommunication, the, norman, and, angevin, kings, had, traditionally, exercised, a, great, deal, of, power, over, the, church, within, their, territories, from, the, 1040s, onwards, however, successive, popes, had, put, forward, a, reforming, message, that, emphasised, the, importance, of, the, church, being, governed, more, coherently, and, more, hierarchically, from, the, centre, and, established, its, own, sphere, of, authority, and, jurisdiction, separate, from, and, independent, of, that, of, the, lay, ruler, in, the, words, of, historian, richard, huscroft, after, the, 1140s, these, principles, had, been, largely, accepted, within, the, english, church, albeit, with, an, element, of, concern, about, centralising, authority, in, rome, these, changes, brought, the, customary, rights, of, lay, rulers, such, as, john, over, ecclesiastical, appointments, into, question, pope, innocent, was, according, to, historian, ralph, turner, an, ambitious, and, aggressive, religious, leader, insistent, on, his, rights, and, responsibilities, within, the, church, john, wanted, john, de, gray, the, bishop, of, norwich, and, one, of, his, own, supporters, to, be, appointed, archbishop, of, canterbury, but, the, cathedral, chapter, for, canterbury, cathedral, claimed, the, exclusive, right, to, elect, the, archbishop, they, favoured, reginald, the, chapter, s, sub, prior, to, complicate, matters, the, bishops, of, the, province, of, canterbury, also, claimed, the, right, to, appoint, the, next, archbishop, the, chapter, secretly, elected, reginald, and, he, travelled, to, rome, to, be, confirmed, the, bishops, challenged, the, appointment, and, the, matter, was, taken, before, innocent, john, forced, the, canterbury, chapter, to, change, their, support, to, john, de, gray, and, a, messenger, was, sent, to, rome, to, inform, the, papacy, of, the, new, decision, innocent, disavowed, both, reginald, and, john, de, gray, and, instead, appointed, his, own, candidate, stephen, langton, john, refused, innocent, s, request, that, he, consent, to, langton, s, appointment, but, the, pope, consecrated, langton, anyway, in, june, 1207, john, was, incensed, about, what, he, perceived, as, an, abrogation, of, his, customary, right, as, monarch, to, influence, the, election, he, complained, both, about, the, choice, of, langton, as, an, individual, as, john, felt, he, was, overly, influenced, by, the, capetian, court, in, paris, and, about, the, process, as, a, whole, he, barred, langton, from, entering, england, and, seized, the, lands, of, the, archbishopric, and, other, papal, possessions, innocent, set, a, commission, in, place, to, try, to, convince, john, to, change, his, mind, but, to, no, avail, innocent, then, placed, an, interdict, on, england, in, march, 1208, prohibiting, clergy, from, conducting, religious, services, with, the, exception, of, baptisms, for, the, young, and, confessions, and, absolutions, for, the, dying, john, treated, the, interdict, as, the, equivalent, of, a, papal, declaration, of, war, he, responded, by, attempting, to, punish, innocent, personally, and, to, drive, a, wedge, between, the, english, clergymen, who, might, support, john, and, those, allying, themselves, firmly, with, the, authorities, in, rome, john, seized, the, lands, of, the, clergymen, unwilling, to, conduct, services, as, well, as, estates, linked, to, innocent, himself, he, arrested, the, illicit, concubines, that, many, clerics, kept, during, the, period, releasing, them, only, after, the, payment, of, fines, he, seized, the, lands, of, members, of, the, church, who, had, fled, england, and, he, promised, protection, for, those, willing, to, remain, loyal, to, him, in, many, cases, individual, institutions, were, able, to, negotiate, terms, for, managing, their, own, properties, and, keeping, the, produce, of, their, estates, by, 1209, the, situation, showed, no, signs, of, resolution, and, innocent, threatened, to, excommunicate, john, if, he, did, not, acquiesce, to, langton, s, appointment, when, this, threat, failed, innocent, excommunicated, the, king, in, november, 1209, although, theoretically, a, significant, blow, to, john, s, legitimacy, this, did, not, appear, to, worry, the, king, greatly, two, of, john, s, close, allies, emperor, otto, iv, and, count, raymond, vi, of, toulouse, had, already, suffered, the, same, punishment, themselves, and, the, significance, of, excommunication, had, been, somewhat, devalued, john, simply, tightened, his, existing, measures, and, accrued, significant, sums, from, the, income, of, vacant, sees, and, abbeys, one, 1213, estimate, for, example, suggested, the, church, had, lost, an, estimated, 100, 000, marks, equivalent, to, 67, 000, at, the, time, to, john, official, figures, suggest, that, around, 14, of, the, annual, income, from, the, english, church, was, being, appropriated, by, john, innocent, gave, some, dispensations, as, the, crisis, progressed, monastic, communities, were, allowed, to, celebrate, mass, in, private, from, 1209, onwards, and, late, in, 1212, the, holy, viaticum, for, the, dying, was, authorised, the, rules, on, burials, and, lay, access, to, churches, appear, to, have, been, steadily, circumvented, at, least, unofficially, although, the, interdict, was, a, burden, to, much, of, the, population, it, did, not, result, in, rebellion, against, john, by, 1213, though, john, was, increasingly, worried, about, the, threat, of, a, french, invasion, some, contemporary, chroniclers, suggest, that, in, january, of, that, year, philip, ii, of, france, had, been, charged, with, deposing, john, on, behalf, of, the, papacy, although, it, appears, that, the, pope, had, merely, prepared, secret, letters, in, case, he, needed, to, claim, the, credit, if, philip, successfully, invaded, england, under, mounting, political, pressure, john, finally, negotiated, terms, for, a, reconciliation, and, the, papal, terms, for, submission, were, accepted, in, the, presence, of, the, papal, legate, pandulf, verraccio, in, may, 1213, at, the, templar, church, at, dover, as, part, of, the, deal, john, offered, to, surrender, the, kingdom, of, england, to, the, papacy, for, a, feudal, service, of, 1, 000, marks, equivalent, to, 700, at, the, time, annually, 700, marks, 500, for, england, and, 300, marks, 200, for, ireland, as, well, as, compensation, to, the, church, for, any, revenue, lost, during, the, crisis, the, agreement, was, formalised, in, the, bulla, aurea, or, golden, bull, this, resolution, produced, mixed, responses, although, some, chroniclers, felt, that, john, had, been, humiliated, by, the, sequence, of, events, there, was, little, public, reaction, the, pope, benefited, from, the, resolution, of, his, long, standing, english, problem, but, john, probably, gained, more, as, innocent, became, a, firm, supporter, of, john, for, the, rest, of, his, reign, backing, him, in, both, domestic, and, continental, policy, issues, innocent, immediately, turned, against, philip, calling, upon, him, to, reject, plans, to, invade, england, and, to, sue, for, peace, john, paid, some, of, the, compensation, money, he, had, promised, the, church, but, he, ceased, making, payments, in, late, 1214, leaving, two, thirds, of, the, sum, unpaid, innocent, appears, to, have, conveniently, forgotten, this, debt, for, the, good, of, the, wider, relationship, tensions, between, john, and, the, barons, had, been, growing, for, several, years, as, demonstrated, by, the, 1212, plot, against, the, king, many, of, the, disaffected, barons, came, from, the, north, of, england, that, faction, was, often, labelled, by, contemporaries, and, historians, as, the, northerners, the, northern, barons, rarely, had, any, personal, stake, in, the, conflict, in, france, and, many, of, them, owed, large, sums, of, money, to, john, the, revolt, has, been, characterised, as, a, rebellion, of, the, king, s, debtors, many, of, john, s, military, household, joined, the, rebels, particularly, amongst, those, that, john, had, appointed, to, administrative, roles, across, england, their, local, links, and, loyalties, outweighed, their, personal, loyalty, to, john, tension, also, grew, across, north, wales, where, opposition, to, the, 1211, treaty, between, john, and, llywelyn, was, turning, into, open, conflict, for, some, the, appointment, of, peter, des, roches, as, justiciar, was, an, important, factor, as, he, was, considered, an, abrasive, foreigner, by, many, of, the, barons, the, failure, of, john, s, french, military, campaign, in, 1214, was, probably, the, final, straw, that, precipitated, the, baronial, uprising, during, john, s, final, years, as, king, james, holt, describes, the, path, to, civil, war, as, direct, short, and, unavoidable, following, the, defeat, at, bouvines, in, 1214, john, began, his, final, campaign, to, reclaim, normandy, from, philip, he, was, optimistic, as, he, had, successfully, built, up, alliances, with, the, emperor, otto, renaud, of, boulogne, and, ferdinand, of, flanders, he, was, enjoying, papal, favour, and, he, had, successfully, built, up, substantial, funds, to, pay, for, the, deployment, of, his, experienced, army, nonetheless, when, john, left, for, poitou, in, february, 1214, many, barons, refused, to, provide, military, service, mercenary, knights, had, to, fill, the, gaps, john, s, plan, was, to, split, philip, s, forces, by, pushing, north, east, from, poitou, towards, paris, whilst, otto, renaud, and, ferdinand, supported, by, william, longesp, e, marched, south, west, from, flanders, the, first, part, of, the, campaign, went, well, with, john, outmanoeuvring, the, forces, under, the, command, of, prince, louis, and, retaking, the, county, of, anjou, by, the, end, of, june, john, besieged, the, castle, of, roche, au, moine, a, key, stronghold, forcing, louis, to, give, battle, against, john, s, larger, army, the, local, angevin, nobles, refused, to, advance, with, john, left, at, something, of, a, disadvantage, john, retreated, back, to, la, rochelle, shortly, afterwards, king, philip, won, the, hard, fought, battle, of, bouvines, in, the, north, against, otto, and, john, s, other, allies, bringing, an, end, to, john, s, hopes, of, retaking, normandy, a, peace, agreement, was, signed, in, which, john, returned, anjou, to, philip, and, paid, him, compensation, the, truce, was, intended, to, last, for, six, years, john, arrived, back, in, england, in, october, within, a, few, months, of, john, s, return, rebel, barons, in, the, north, and, east, of, england, were, organising, resistance, to, his, rule, john, held, a, council, in, london, in, january, 1215, to, discuss, potential, reforms, and, sponsored, discussions, in, oxford, between, his, agents, and, the, rebels, during, the, spring, he, appears, to, have, been, playing, for, time, until, pope, innocent, iii, could, send, letters, giving, him, explicit, papal, support, this, was, particularly, important, for, john, as, a, way, of, pressuring, the, barons, but, also, as, a, way, of, controlling, stephen, langton, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, in, the, meantime, john, began, to, recruit, fresh, mercenary, forces, from, poitou, although, some, were, later, sent, back, to, avoid, giving, the, impression, that, john, was, escalating, the, conflict, the, king, announced, his, intent, to, become, a, crusader, a, move, which, gave, him, additional, political, protection, under, church, law, letters, of, support, from, the, pope, arrived, in, april, but, by, then, the, rebel, barons, had, organised, they, congregated, at, northampton, in, may, and, renounced, their, feudal, ties, to, john, appointing, robert, fitz, walter, as, their, military, leader, this, self, proclaimed, army, of, god, marched, on, london, taking, the, capital, as, well, as, lincoln, and, exeter, john, s, efforts, to, appear, moderate, and, conciliatory, had, been, largely, successful, but, once, the, rebels, held, london, they, attracted, a, fresh, wave, of, defectors, from, john, s, royalist, faction, john, instructed, langton, to, organise, peace, talks, with, the, rebel, barons, john, met, the, rebel, leaders, at, runnymede, near, windsor, castle, on, 15, june, 1215, langton, s, efforts, at, mediation, created, a, charter, capturing, the, proposed, peace, agreement, it, was, later, renamed, magna, carta, or, great, charter, the, charter, went, beyond, simply, addressing, specific, baronial, complaints, and, formed, a, wider, proposal, for, political, reform, albeit, one, focusing, on, the, rights, of, free, men, not, serfs, and, unfree, labour, it, promised, the, protection, of, church, rights, protection, from, illegal, imprisonment, access, to, swift, justice, new, taxation, only, with, baronial, consent, and, limitations, on, scutage, and, other, feudal, payments, a, council, of, twenty, five, barons, would, be, created, to, monitor, and, ensure, john, s, future, adherence, to, the, charter, whilst, the, rebel, army, would, stand, down, and, london, would, be, surrendered, to, the, king, neither, john, nor, the, rebel, barons, seriously, attempted, to, implement, the, peace, accord, the, rebel, barons, suspected, that, the, proposed, baronial, council, would, be, unacceptable, to, john, and, that, he, would, challenge, the, legality, of, the, charter, they, packed, the, baronial, council, with, their, own, hardliners, and, refused, to, demobilise, their, forces, or, surrender, london, as, agreed, despite, his, promises, to, the, contrary, john, appealed, to, innocent, for, help, observing, that, the, charter, compromised, the, pope, s, rights, under, the, 1213, agreement, that, had, appointed, him, john, s, feudal, lord, innocent, obliged, he, declared, the, charter, not, only, shameful, and, demeaning, but, illegal, and, unjust, and, excommunicated, the, rebel, barons, the, failure, of, the, agreement, led, rapidly, to, the, first, barons, war, the, rebels, made, the, first, move, in, the, war, seizing, the, strategic, rochester, castle, owned, by, langton, but, left, almost, unguarded, by, the, archbishop, john, was, well, prepared, for, a, conflict, he, had, stockpiled, money, to, pay, for, mercenaries, and, ensured, the, support, of, the, powerful, marcher, lords, with, their, own, feudal, forces, such, as, william, marshal, and, ranulf, de, blondeville, 6th, earl, of, chester, the, rebels, lacked, the, engineering, expertise, or, heavy, equipment, necessary, to, assault, the, network, of, royal, castles, that, cut, off, the, northern, rebel, barons, from, those, in, the, south, john, s, strategy, was, to, isolate, the, rebel, barons, in, london, protect, his, own, supply, lines, to, his, key, source, of, mercenaries, in, flanders, prevent, the, french, from, landing, in, the, south, east, and, then, win, the, war, through, slow, attrition, john, put, off, dealing, with, the, badly, deteriorating, situation, in, north, wales, where, prince, llywelyn, was, leading, a, rebellion, against, the, 1211, settlement, john, s, campaign, started, well, in, november, john, retook, rochester, castle, from, rebel, baron, william, d, aubigny, in, a, sophisticated, assault, one, chronicler, had, not, seen, a, siege, so, hard, pressed, or, so, strongly, resisted, whilst, historian, reginald, brown, describes, it, as, one, of, the, greatest, operations, in, england, up, to, that, time, having, regained, the, south, east, john, split, his, forces, sending, william, longesp, e, to, retake, the, north, side, of, london, and, east, anglia, whilst, john, himself, headed, north, via, nottingham, to, attack, the, estates, of, the, northern, barons, both, operations, were, successful, and, the, majority, of, the, remaining, rebels, were, pinned, down, in, london, in, january, 1216, john, marched, against, alexander, ii, of, scotland, who, had, allied, himself, with, the, rebel, cause, john, took, back, alexander, s, possessions, in, northern, england, in, a, rapid, campaign, and, pushed, up, towards, edinburgh, over, a, ten, day, period, the, rebel, barons, responded, by, inviting, prince, louis, of, france, to, lead, them, louis, had, a, claim, to, the, english, throne, by, virtue, of, his, marriage, to, blanche, of, castile, a, granddaughter, of, henry, ii, philip, may, have, provided, his, son, with, private, support, but, refused, to, openly, support, louis, who, was, excommunicated, by, innocent, for, taking, part, in, the, war, against, john, louis, planned, arrival, in, england, presented, a, significant, problem, for, john, as, louis, would, bring, with, him, naval, vessels, and, siege, engines, essential, to, the, rebel, cause, once, john, contained, alexander, in, scotland, he, marched, south, to, deal, with, the, challenge, of, the, coming, invasion, louis, intended, to, land, in, the, south, of, england, in, may, 1216, and, john, assembled, a, naval, force, to, intercept, him, unfortunately, for, john, his, fleet, was, dispersed, by, bad, storms, and, louis, landed, unopposed, in, kent, john, hesitated, and, decided, not, to, attack, louis, immediately, either, due, to, the, risks, of, open, battle, or, over, concerns, about, the, loyalty, of, his, own, men, louis, and, the, rebel, barons, advanced, west, and, john, retreated, spending, the, summer, reorganising, his, defences, across, the, rest, of, the, kingdom, john, saw, several, of, his, military, household, desert, to, the, rebels, including, his, half, brother, william, longesp, e, by, the, end, of, the, summer, the, rebels, had, regained, the, south, east, of, england, and, parts, of, the, north, in, september, 1216, john, began, a, fresh, vigorous, attack, he, marched, from, the, cotswolds, feigned, an, offensive, to, relieve, the, besieged, windsor, castle, and, attacked, eastwards, around, london, to, cambridge, to, separate, the, rebel, held, areas, of, lincolnshire, and, east, anglia, from, there, he, travelled, north, to, relieve, the, rebel, siege, at, lincoln, and, back, east, to, lynn, probably, to, order, further, supplies, from, the, continent, in, lynn, john, contracted, dysentery, which, would, ultimately, prove, fatal, meanwhile, alexander, ii, invaded, northern, england, again, taking, carlisle, in, august, and, then, marching, south, to, give, homage, to, prince, louis, for, his, english, possessions, john, narrowly, missed, intercepting, alexander, along, the, way, tensions, between, louis, and, the, english, barons, began, to, increase, prompting, a, wave, of, desertions, including, william, marshal, s, son, william, and, william, longesp, e, who, both, returned, to, john, s, faction, in, his, will, john, ordered, that, his, niece, eleanor, who, might, have, had, a, claim, to, the, throne, of, his, successor, henry, iii, never, be, released, from, prison, john, returned, west, but, is, said, to, have, lost, much, of, his, baggage, train, along, the, way, roger, of, wendover, provides, the, most, graphic, account, of, this, suggesting, that, the, king, s, belongings, including, the, english, crown, jewels, were, lost, as, he, crossed, one, of, the, tidal, estuaries, which, empties, into, the, wash, being, sucked, in, by, quicksand, and, whirlpools, accounts, of, the, incident, vary, considerably, between, the, various, chroniclers, and, the, exact, location, of, the, incident, has, never, been, confirmed, the, losses, may, have, involved, only, a, few, of, his, pack, horses, modern, historians, assert, that, by, october, 1216, john, faced, a, stalemate, a, military, situation, uncompromised, by, defeat, john, s, illness, grew, worse, and, by, the, time, he, reached, newark, castle, nottinghamshire, he, was, unable, to, travel, any, farther, he, died, on, the, night, of, 18, 19, october, numerous, probably, fictitious, accounts, circulated, soon, after, his, death, that, he, had, been, killed, by, poisoned, ale, poisoned, plums, or, a, surfeit, of, peaches, his, body, was, escorted, south, by, a, company, of, mercenaries, and, he, was, buried, in, worcester, cathedral, in, front, of, the, altar, of, st, wulfstan, a, new, sarcophagus, with, an, effigy, was, made, for, him, in, 1232, in, which, his, remains, now, rest, in, the, aftermath, of, john, s, death, william, marshal, was, declared, the, protector, of, the, nine, year, old, henry, iii, the, civil, war, continued, until, royalist, victories, at, the, battles, of, lincoln, and, dover, in, 1217, louis, gave, up, his, claim, to, the, english, throne, and, signed, the, treaty, of, lambeth, the, failed, magna, carta, agreement, was, resuscitated, by, marshal, s, administration, and, reissued, in, an, edited, form, in, 1217, as, a, basis, for, future, government, henry, iii, continued, his, attempts, to, reclaim, normandy, and, anjou, until, 1259, but, john, s, continental, losses, and, the, consequent, growth, of, capetian, power, in, the, 13th, century, proved, to, mark, a, turning, point, in, european, history, john, s, first, wife, isabella, countess, of, gloucester, was, released, from, imprisonment, in, 1214, she, remarried, twice, and, died, in, 1217, john, s, second, wife, isabella, of, angoul, me, left, england, for, angoul, me, soon, after, the, king, s, death, she, became, a, powerful, regional, leader, but, largely, abandoned, the, children, that, she, had, borne, to, john, their, eldest, son, henry, iii, ruled, as, king, of, england, for, the, majority, of, the, 13th, century, their, other, son, richard, of, cornwall, became, a, noted, european, leader, and, ultimately, the, king, of, the, romans, in, the, holy, roman, empire, their, daughter, joan, became, queen, of, scotland, on, her, marriage, to, alexander, ii, another, daughter, isabella, was, holy, roman, empress, as, the, wife, of, emperor, frederick, ii, the, youngest, daughter, eleanor, married, william, marshal, s, son, also, called, william, and, later, the, famous, english, rebel, simon, de, montfort, by, various, mistresses, john, had, eight, possibly, nine, sons, richard, oliver, john, geoffrey, henry, osbert, gifford, eudes, bartholomew, and, probably, philip, and, two, or, three, daughters, joan, maud, and, probably, isabel, of, these, joan, became, the, most, famous, marrying, prince, llywelyn, the, great, of, wales, historical, interpretations, of, john, have, been, subject, to, considerable, change, over, the, centuries, medieval, chroniclers, provided, the, first, contemporary, or, near, contemporary, histories, of, john, s, reign, one, group, of, chroniclers, wrote, early, in, john, s, life, or, around, the, time, of, his, accession, including, richard, of, devizes, william, of, newburgh, roger, of, hoveden, and, ralph, de, diceto, these, historians, were, generally, unsympathetic, to, john, s, behaviour, under, richard, s, rule, but, slightly, more, positive, towards, the, very, earliest, years, of, john, s, reign, reliable, accounts, of, the, middle, and, later, parts, of, john, s, reign, are, more, limited, with, gervase, of, canterbury, and, ralph, of, coggeshall, writing, the, main, accounts, neither, of, them, were, positive, about, john, s, performance, as, king, much, of, john, s, later, negative, reputation, was, established, by, two, chroniclers, writing, after, his, death, roger, of, wendover, and, matthew, paris, the, latter, claiming, that, john, attempted, conversion, to, islam, in, exchange, for, military, aid, from, the, almohad, ruler, muhammad, al, nasir, a, story, modern, historians, consider, untrue, in, the, 16th, century, political, and, religious, changes, altered, the, attitude, of, historians, towards, john, tudor, historians, were, generally, favourably, inclined, towards, the, king, focusing, on, his, opposition, to, the, papacy, and, his, promotion, of, the, special, rights, and, prerogatives, of, a, king, revisionist, histories, written, by, john, foxe, william, tyndale, and, robert, barnes, portrayed, john, as, an, early, protestant, hero, and, foxe, included, the, king, in, his, book, of, martyrs, john, speed, s, historie, of, great, britaine, in, 1632, praised, john, s, great, renown, as, a, king, he, blamed, the, bias, of, medieval, chroniclers, for, the, king, s, poor, reputation, by, the, victorian, period, in, the, 19th, century, historians, were, more, inclined, to, draw, on, the, judgements, of, the, chroniclers, and, to, focus, on, john, s, moral, personality, kate, norgate, for, example, argued, that, john, s, downfall, had, been, due, not, to, his, failure, in, war, or, strategy, but, due, to, his, almost, superhuman, wickedness, whilst, james, ramsay, blamed, john, s, family, background, and, his, cruel, personality, for, his, downfall, historians, in, the, whiggish, tradition, focusing, on, documents, such, as, the, domesday, book, and, magna, carta, trace, a, progressive, and, universalist, course, of, political, and, economic, development, in, england, over, the, medieval, period, these, historians, were, often, inclined, to, see, john, s, reign, and, his, signing, of, magna, carta, in, particular, as, a, positive, step, in, the, constitutional, development, of, england, despite, the, flaws, of, the, king, himself, winston, churchill, for, example, argued, that, hen, the, long, tally, is, added, it, will, be, seen, that, the, british, nation, and, the, english, speaking, world, owe, far, more, to, the, vices, of, john, than, to, the, labours, of, virtuous, sovereigns, in, the, 1940s, new, interpretations, of, john, s, reign, began, to, be, published, based, on, research, into, documents, dating, to, his, reign, such, as, pipe, rolls, charters, court, documents, and, similar, primary, records, notably, an, essay, by, vivian, galbraith, in, 1945, proposed, a, new, approach, to, understanding, the, ruler, the, use, of, recorded, evidence, was, combined, with, an, increased, scepticism, about, two, of, the, most, colourful, chroniclers, of, john, s, reign, roger, of, wendover, and, matthew, paris, in, many, cases, the, detail, provided, by, these, chroniclers, both, writing, after, john, s, death, was, challenged, by, modern, historians, interpretations, of, magna, carta, and, the, role, of, the, rebel, barons, in, 1215, have, been, significantly, revised, although, the, charter, s, symbolic, constitutional, value, for, later, generations, is, unquestionable, in, the, context, of, john, s, reign, most, historians, now, consider, it, a, failed, peace, agreement, between, partisan, factions, there, has, been, increasing, debate, about, the, nature, of, john, s, irish, policies, specialists, in, irish, medieval, history, such, as, sean, duffy, have, challenged, the, conventional, narrative, established, by, lewis, warren, suggesting, that, ireland, was, less, stable, by, 1216, than, was, previously, supposed, most, historians, today, including, john, s, recent, biographers, ralph, turner, and, lewis, warren, argue, that, john, was, an, unsuccessful, monarch, but, note, that, his, failings, were, exaggerated, by, 12th, and, 13th, century, chroniclers, jim, bradbury, notes, the, current, consensus, that, john, was, a, hard, working, administrator, an, able, man, an, able, general, albeit, as, turner, suggests, with, distasteful, even, dangerous, personality, traits, including, pettiness, spitefulness, and, cruelty, john, gillingham, author, of, a, major, biography, of, richard, i, follows, this, line, too, although, he, considers, john, a, less, effective, general, than, do, turner, or, warren, and, describes, him, one, of, the, worst, kings, ever, to, rule, england, bradbury, takes, a, moderate, line, but, suggests, that, in, recent, years, modern, historians, have, been, overly, lenient, towards, john, s, numerous, faults, popular, historian, frank, mclynn, maintains, a, counter, revisionist, perspective, on, john, arguing, that, the, king, s, modern, reputation, amongst, historians, is, bizarre, and, that, as, a, monarch, john, fails, almost, all, those, that, can, be, legitimately, set, according, to, c, warren, hollister, the, dramatic, ambivalence, of, his, personality, the, passions, that, he, stirred, among, his, own, contemporaries, the, very, magnitude, of, his, failures, have, made, him, an, object, of, endless, fascination, to, historians, and, biographers, popular, representations, of, john, first, began, to, emerge, during, the, tudor, period, mirroring, the, revisionist, histories, of, the, time, the, anonymous, play, the, troublesome, reign, of, king, john, portrayed, the, king, as, a, proto, protestant, martyr, similar, to, that, shown, in, john, bale, s, morality, play, kynge, johan, in, which, john, attempts, to, save, england, from, the, evil, agents, of, the, roman, church, by, contrast, shakespeare, s, king, john, a, relatively, anti, catholic, play, that, draws, on, the, troublesome, reign, for, its, source, material, offers, a, more, balanced, dual, view, of, a, complex, monarch, as, both, a, proto, protestant, victim, of, rome, s, machinations, and, as, a, weak, selfishly, motivated, ruler, anthony, munday, s, play, the, downfall, and, the, death, of, robert, earl, of, huntington, portrays, many, of, john, s, negative, traits, but, adopts, a, positive, interpretation, of, the, king, s, stand, against, the, roman, catholic, church, in, line, with, the, contemporary, views, of, the, tudor, monarchs, by, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, plays, such, as, robert, davenport, s, king, john, and, matilda, although, based, largely, on, the, earlier, elizabethan, works, were, transferring, the, role, of, protestant, champion, to, the, barons, and, focusing, more, on, the, tyrannical, aspects, of, john, s, behaviour, nineteenth, century, fictional, depictions, of, john, were, heavily, influenced, by, sir, walter, scott, s, historical, romance, ivanhoe, which, presented, an, almost, totally, unfavourable, picture, of, the, king, the, work, drew, on, 19th, century, histories, of, the, period, and, on, shakespeare, s, play, scott, s, work, influenced, the, late, 19th, century, children, s, writer, howard, pyle, s, book, the, merry, adventures, of, robin, hood, which, in, turn, established, john, as, the, principal, villain, within, the, traditional, robin, hood, narrative, during, the, 20th, century, john, was, normally, depicted, in, fictional, books, and, films, alongside, robin, hood, sam, de, grasse, s, role, as, john, in, the, black, and, white, 1922, film, version, shows, john, committing, numerous, atrocities, and, acts, of, torture, claude, rains, played, john, in, the, 1938, colour, version, alongside, errol, flynn, starting, a, trend, for, films, to, depict, john, as, an, effeminate, arrogant, and, cowardly, stay, at, home, the, character, of, john, acts, either, to, highlight, the, virtues, of, king, richard, or, contrasts, with, the, sheriff, of, nottingham, who, is, usually, the, swashbuckling, villain, opposing, robin, an, extreme, version, of, this, trend, can, be, seen, in, the, 1973, disney, cartoon, version, for, example, which, depicts, john, voiced, by, peter, ustinov, as, a, cowardly, thumbsucking, lion, popular, works, that, depict, john, beyond, the, robin, hood, legends, such, as, james, goldman, s, play, and, later, film, the, lion, in, winter, set, in, 1183, commonly, present, him, as, an, effete, weakling, in, this, instance, contrasted, with, the, more, masculine, henry, ii, or, as, a, tyrant, as, in, a, a, milne, s, poem, for, children, king, john, s, christmas, john, and, isabella, of, angoul, me, had, five, children, john, had, several, mistresses, including, one, named, suzanne, his, known, illegitimate, children, are
