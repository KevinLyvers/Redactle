dante, alighieri, italian, c, may, 1265, september, 14, 1321, most, likely, baptized, durante, di, alighiero, degli, alighieri, and, widely, known, and, often, referred, to, in, english, mononymously, as, dante, english, d, n, t, e, d, n, t, e, d, n, t, i, was, an, italian, poet, writer, and, philosopher, his, divine, comedy, originally, called, comed, a, modern, italian, commedia, and, later, christened, divina, by, giovanni, boccaccio, is, widely, considered, one, of, the, most, important, poems, of, the, middle, ages, and, the, greatest, literary, work, in, the, italian, language, dante, is, known, for, establishing, the, use, of, the, vernacular, in, literature, at, a, time, when, most, poetry, was, written, in, latin, which, was, accessible, only, to, educated, readers, his, de, vulgari, eloquentia, on, eloquence, in, the, vernacular, was, one, of, the, first, scholarly, defenses, of, the, vernacular, his, use, of, the, florentine, dialect, for, works, such, as, the, new, life, 1295, and, divine, comedy, helped, establish, the, modern, day, standardized, italian, language, by, writing, his, poem, in, the, italian, vernacular, rather, than, in, latin, dante, influenced, the, course, of, literary, development, making, italian, the, literary, language, in, western, europe, for, several, centuries, his, work, set, a, precedent, that, important, italian, writers, such, as, petrarch, and, boccaccio, would, later, follow, dante, was, instrumental, in, establishing, the, literature, of, italy, and, is, considered, to, be, among, the, country, s, national, poets, and, the, western, world, s, greatest, literary, icons, his, depictions, of, hell, purgatory, and, heaven, provided, inspiration, for, the, larger, body, of, western, art, and, literature, he, influenced, english, writers, such, as, geoffrey, chaucer, john, milton, and, alfred, tennyson, among, many, others, in, addition, the, first, use, of, the, interlocking, three, line, rhyme, scheme, or, the, terza, rima, is, attributed, to, him, he, is, described, as, the, father, of, the, italian, language, and, in, italy, he, is, often, referred, to, as, il, sommo, poeta, the, supreme, poet, dante, petrarch, and, boccaccio, are, also, called, the, tre, corone, three, crowns, of, italian, literature, dante, was, born, in, florence, republic, of, florence, in, what, is, now, italy, the, exact, date, of, his, birth, is, unknown, although, it, is, believed, to, be, around, may, 1265, this, can, be, deduced, from, autobiographic, allusions, in, the, divine, comedy, its, first, section, the, inferno, begins, nel, mezzo, del, cammin, di, nostra, vita, midway, upon, the, journey, of, our, life, implying, that, dante, was, around, 35, years, old, since, the, average, lifespan, according, to, the, bible, psalm, 89, 10, vulgate, is, 70, years, and, since, his, imaginary, travel, to, the, netherworld, took, place, in, 1300, he, was, most, probably, born, around, 1265, some, verses, of, the, paradiso, section, of, the, divine, comedy, also, provide, a, possible, clue, that, he, was, born, under, the, sign, of, gemini, as, i, revolved, with, the, eternal, twins, i, saw, revealed, from, hills, to, river, outlets, the, threshing, floor, that, makes, us, so, ferocious, xxii, 151, 154, in, 1265, the, sun, was, in, gemini, between, approximately, may, 11, and, june, 11, julian, calendar, dante, claimed, that, his, family, descended, from, the, ancient, romans, inferno, xv, 76, but, the, earliest, relative, he, could, mention, by, name, was, his, great, great, grandfather, cacciaguida, degli, elisei, paradiso, xv, 135, born, no, earlier, than, about, 1100, dante, s, father, was, alighiero, di, bellincione, a, businessman, and, moneylender, and, dante, s, mother, was, bella, probably, a, member, of, the, abati, family, a, noble, florentine, family, she, died, when, dante, was, not, yet, ten, years, old, alighiero, soon, married, again, to, lapa, di, chiarissimo, cialuffi, it, is, uncertain, whether, he, really, married, her, since, widowers, were, socially, limited, in, such, matters, but, she, definitely, bore, him, two, children, dante, s, half, brother, francesco, and, half, sister, tana, gaetana, during, dante, s, time, most, northern, italian, city, states, were, split, into, two, political, factions, the, guelphs, who, supported, the, papacy, and, the, ghibellines, who, supported, the, holy, roman, empire, dante, s, family, was, loyal, to, the, guelphs, the, ghibellines, took, over, florence, at, the, battle, of, montaperti, in, 1260, forcing, out, many, of, the, guelphs, although, dante, s, family, were, guelphs, they, suffered, no, reprisals, after, the, battle, probably, because, of, alighiero, s, low, public, standing, the, guelphs, later, fought, the, ghibellines, again, in, 1266, at, the, battle, of, benevento, retaking, florence, from, the, ghibellines, dante, said, he, first, met, beatrice, portinari, daughter, of, folco, portinari, when, he, was, nine, she, was, eight, and, he, claimed, to, have, fallen, in, love, with, her, at, first, sight, apparently, without, even, talking, with, her, when, he, was, 12, however, he, was, promised, in, marriage, to, gemma, di, manetto, donati, daughter, of, manetto, donati, member, of, the, powerful, donati, family, contracting, marriages, for, children, at, such, an, early, age, was, quite, common, and, involved, a, formal, ceremony, including, contracts, signed, before, a, notary, dante, claimed, to, have, seen, beatrice, again, frequently, after, he, turned, 18, exchanging, greetings, with, her, in, the, streets, of, florence, though, he, never, knew, her, well, years, after, his, marriage, to, gemma, he, claims, to, have, met, beatrice, again, he, wrote, several, sonnets, to, beatrice, but, never, mentioned, gemma, in, any, of, his, poems, he, refers, to, other, donati, relations, notably, forese, and, piccarda, in, his, divine, comedy, the, exact, date, of, his, marriage, is, not, known, the, only, certain, information, is, that, before, his, exile, in, 1301, he, had, fathered, three, children, with, gemma, pietro, jacopo, and, antonia, dante, fought, with, the, guelph, cavalry, at, the, battle, of, campaldino, june, 11, 1289, this, victory, brought, about, a, reformation, of, the, florentine, constitution, to, take, part, in, public, life, one, had, to, enroll, in, one, of, the, city, s, many, commercial, or, artisan, guilds, so, dante, entered, the, physicians, and, apothecaries, guild, his, name, is, occasionally, recorded, as, speaking, or, voting, in, the, councils, of, the, republic, many, minutes, from, such, meetings, between, 1298, 1300, were, lost, so, the, extent, of, his, participation, is, uncertain, not, much, is, known, about, dante, s, education, he, presumably, studied, at, home, or, in, a, chapter, school, attached, to, a, church, or, monastery, in, florence, it, is, known, that, he, studied, tuscan, poetry, and, that, he, admired, the, compositions, of, the, bolognese, poet, guido, guinizelli, in, purgatorio, xxvi, he, characterized, him, as, his, father, at, a, time, when, the, sicilian, school, scuola, poetica, siciliana, a, cultural, group, from, sicily, was, becoming, known, in, tuscany, he, also, discovered, the, proven, al, poetry, of, the, troubadours, such, as, arnaut, daniel, and, the, latin, writers, of, classical, antiquity, including, cicero, ovid, and, especially, virgil, dante, s, interactions, with, beatrice, set, an, example, of, so, called, courtly, love, a, phenomenon, developed, in, french, and, proven, al, poetry, of, prior, centuries, dante, s, experience, of, such, love, was, typical, but, his, expression, of, it, was, unique, it, was, in, the, name, of, this, love, that, dante, left, his, imprint, on, the, dolce, stil, nuovo, sweet, new, style, a, term, that, dante, himself, coined, and, he, would, join, other, contemporary, poets, and, writers, in, exploring, never, before, emphasized, aspects, of, love, amore, love, for, beatrice, as, petrarch, would, express, for, laura, somewhat, differently, would, be, his, reason, for, writing, poetry, and, for, living, together, with, political, passions, in, many, of, his, poems, she, is, depicted, as, semi, divine, watching, over, him, constantly, and, providing, spiritual, instruction, sometimes, harshly, when, beatrice, died, in, 1290, dante, sought, refuge, in, latin, literature, the, convivio, chronicles, his, having, read, boethius, s, de, consolatione, philosophiae, and, cicero, s, de, amicitia, he, next, dedicated, himself, to, philosophical, studies, at, religious, schools, like, the, dominican, one, in, santa, maria, novella, he, took, part, in, the, disputes, that, the, two, principal, mendicant, orders, franciscan, and, dominican, publicly, or, indirectly, held, in, florence, the, former, explaining, the, doctrines, of, the, mystics, and, of, st, bonaventure, the, latter, expounding, on, the, theories, of, st, thomas, aquinas, at, around, the, age, of, 18, dante, met, guido, cavalcanti, lapo, gianni, cino, da, pistoia, and, soon, after, brunetto, latini, together, they, became, the, leaders, of, the, dolce, stil, nuovo, brunetto, later, received, special, mention, in, the, divine, comedy, inferno, xv, 28, for, what, he, had, taught, dante, nor, speaking, less, on, that, account, i, go, with, ser, brunetto, and, i, ask, who, are, his, most, known, and, most, eminent, companions, some, fifty, poetical, commentaries, by, dante, are, known, the, so, called, rime, rhymes, others, being, included, in, the, later, vita, nuova, and, convivio, other, studies, are, reported, or, deduced, from, vita, nuova, or, the, comedy, regarding, painting, and, music, dante, like, most, florentines, of, his, day, was, embroiled, in, the, guelph, ghibelline, conflict, he, fought, in, the, battle, of, campaldino, june, 11, 1289, with, the, florentine, guelphs, against, arezzo, ghibellines, he, fought, as, a, feditore, responsible, for, the, first, attack, to, further, his, political, career, he, obtained, admission, to, the, guild, of, physicians, and, apothecaries, around, 1295, he, likely, joined, the, guild, due, to, association, between, philosophy, and, medicine, but, also, may, have, joined, as, apothecaries, were, also, booksellers, his, guild, membership, allowed, him, to, hold, public, office, in, florence, as, a, politician, he, held, various, offices, over, some, years, in, a, city, rife, with, political, unrest, after, defeating, the, ghibellines, the, guelphs, divided, into, two, factions, the, white, guelphs, guelfi, bianchi, dante, s, party, led, by, vieri, dei, cerchi, and, the, black, guelphs, guelfi, neri, led, by, corso, donati, although, the, split, was, along, family, lines, at, first, ideological, differences, arose, based, on, opposing, views, of, the, papal, role, in, florentine, affairs, the, blacks, supported, the, pope, and, the, whites, wanted, more, freedom, from, rome, the, whites, took, power, first, and, expelled, the, blacks, in, response, pope, boniface, viii, planned, a, military, occupation, of, florence, in, 1301, charles, of, valois, brother, of, king, philip, iv, of, france, was, expected, to, visit, florence, because, the, pope, had, appointed, him, as, peacemaker, for, tuscany, but, the, city, s, government, had, treated, the, pope, s, ambassadors, badly, a, few, weeks, before, seeking, independence, from, papal, influence, it, was, believed, charles, had, received, other, unofficial, instructions, so, the, council, sent, a, delegation, that, included, dante, to, rome, to, persuade, the, pope, not, to, send, charles, to, florence, pope, boniface, quickly, dismissed, the, other, delegates, and, asked, dante, alone, to, remain, in, rome, at, the, same, time, november, 1, 1301, charles, of, valois, entered, florence, with, the, black, guelphs, who, in, the, next, six, days, destroyed, much, of, the, city, and, killed, many, of, their, enemies, a, new, black, guelph, government, was, installed, and, cante, dei, gabrielli, da, gubbio, was, appointed, podest, of, the, city, in, march, 1302, dante, a, white, guelph, by, affiliation, along, with, the, gherardini, family, was, condemned, to, exile, for, two, years, and, ordered, to, pay, a, large, fine, dante, was, accused, of, corruption, and, financial, wrongdoing, by, the, black, guelphs, for, the, time, that, dante, was, serving, as, city, prior, florence, s, highest, position, for, two, months, in, 1300, the, poet, was, still, in, rome, in, 1302, as, the, pope, who, had, backed, the, black, guelphs, had, suggested, that, dante, stay, there, florence, under, the, black, guelphs, therefore, considered, dante, an, absconder, dante, did, not, pay, the, fine, in, part, because, he, believed, he, was, not, guilty, and, in, part, because, all, his, assets, in, florence, had, been, seized, by, the, black, guelphs, he, was, condemned, to, perpetual, exile, if, he, had, returned, to, florence, without, paying, the, fine, he, could, have, been, burned, at, the, stake, in, june, 2008, nearly, seven, centuries, after, his, death, the, city, council, of, florence, passed, a, motion, rescinding, dante, s, sentence, in, 1306, 07, dante, was, a, guest, of, moroello, malaspina, in, the, region, of, lunigiana, dante, took, part, in, several, attempts, by, the, white, guelphs, to, regain, power, but, these, failed, due, to, treachery, bitter, at, the, treatment, he, received, from, his, enemies, he, grew, disgusted, with, the, infighting, and, ineffectiveness, of, his, former, allies, and, vowed, to, become, a, party, of, one, he, went, to, verona, as, a, guest, of, bartolomeo, i, della, scala, then, moved, to, sarzana, in, liguria, later, he, is, supposed, to, have, lived, in, lucca, with, a, woman, named, gentucca, she, apparently, made, his, stay, comfortable, and, he, later, gratefully, mentioned, her, in, purgatorio, xxiv, 37, some, speculative, sources, claim, he, visited, paris, between, 1308, and, 1310, and, other, sources, even, less, trustworthy, say, he, went, to, oxford, these, claims, first, made, in, boccaccio, s, book, on, dante, several, decades, after, his, death, seem, inspired, by, readers, who, were, impressed, with, the, poet, s, wide, learning, and, erudition, evidently, dante, s, command, of, philosophy, and, his, literary, interests, deepened, in, exile, and, when, he, was, no, longer, busy, with, the, day, to, day, business, of, florentine, domestic, politics, and, this, is, evidenced, in, his, prose, writings, in, this, period, there, is, no, real, evidence, that, he, ever, left, italy, dante, s, immensa, dei, dilectione, testante, to, henry, vii, of, luxembourg, confirms, his, residence, beneath, the, springs, of, arno, near, tuscany, in, april, 1311, in, 1310, holy, roman, emperor, henry, vii, of, luxembourg, marched, into, italy, at, the, head, of, 5, 000, troops, dante, saw, in, him, a, new, charlemagne, who, would, restore, the, office, of, the, holy, roman, emperor, to, its, former, glory, and, also, retake, florence, from, the, black, guelphs, he, wrote, to, henry, and, several, italian, princes, demanding, that, they, destroy, the, black, guelphs, mixing, religion, and, private, concerns, in, his, writings, he, invoked, the, worst, anger, of, god, against, his, city, and, suggested, several, particular, targets, who, were, also, his, personal, enemies, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, wrote, de, monarchia, proposing, a, universal, monarchy, under, henry, vii, at, some, point, during, his, exile, he, conceived, of, the, comedy, but, the, date, is, uncertain, the, work, is, much, more, assured, and, on, a, larger, scale, than, anything, he, had, written, in, florence, it, is, likely, he, would, have, undertaken, such, a, work, only, after, he, realized, his, political, ambitions, which, had, been, central, to, him, up, to, his, banishment, had, been, halted, for, some, time, possibly, forever, it, is, also, noticeable, that, beatrice, has, returned, to, his, imagination, with, renewed, force, and, with, a, wider, meaning, than, in, the, vita, nuova, in, convivio, written, c, 1304, 07, he, had, declared, that, the, memory, of, this, youthful, romance, belonged, to, the, past, an, early, indication, that, the, poem, was, underway, is, a, notice, by, francesco, da, barberino, tucked, into, his, documenti, d, amore, lessons, of, love, probably, written, in, 1314, or, early, 1315, francesco, notes, that, dante, followed, the, aeneid, in, a, poem, called, comedy, and, that, the, setting, of, this, poem, or, part, of, it, was, the, underworld, i, e, hell, the, brief, note, gives, no, incontestable, indication, that, barberino, had, seen, or, read, even, the, inferno, or, that, this, part, had, been, published, at, the, time, but, it, indicates, composition, was, well, underway, and, that, the, sketching, of, the, poem, might, have, begun, some, years, before, it, has, been, suggested, that, a, knowledge, of, dante, s, work, also, underlies, some, of, the, illuminations, in, francesco, da, barberino, s, earlier, officiolum, a, manuscript, that, came, to, light, in, 2003, it, is, known, that, the, inferno, had, been, published, by, 1317, this, is, established, by, quoted, lines, interspersed, in, the, margins, of, contemporary, dated, records, from, bologna, but, there, is, no, certainty, as, to, whether, the, three, parts, of, the, poem, were, each, published, in, full, or, rather, a, few, cantos, at, a, time, paradiso, was, likely, finished, before, he, died, but, it, may, have, been, published, posthumously, in, 1312, henry, assaulted, florence, and, defeated, the, black, guelphs, but, there, is, no, evidence, that, dante, was, involved, some, say, he, refused, to, participate, in, the, attack, on, his, city, by, a, foreigner, others, suggest, that, he, had, become, unpopular, with, the, white, guelphs, too, and, that, any, trace, of, his, passage, had, carefully, been, removed, henry, vii, died, from, a, fever, in, 1313, and, with, him, any, hope, for, dante, to, see, florence, again, he, returned, to, verona, where, cangrande, i, della, scala, allowed, him, to, live, in, certain, security, and, presumably, in, a, fair, degree, of, prosperity, cangrande, was, admitted, to, dante, s, paradise, paradiso, xvii, 76, during, the, period, of, his, exile, dante, corresponded, with, dominican, theologian, fr, nicholas, brunacci, op, who, had, been, a, student, of, thomas, aquinas, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, in, rome, later, at, paris, and, of, albert, the, great, at, the, cologne, studium, brunacci, became, lector, at, the, santa, sabina, studium, forerunner, of, the, pontifical, university, of, saint, thomas, aquinas, and, later, served, in, the, papal, curia, in, 1315, florence, was, forced, by, uguccione, della, faggiuola, the, military, officer, controlling, the, town, to, grant, an, amnesty, to, those, in, exile, including, dante, but, for, this, florence, required, public, penance, in, addition, to, payment, of, a, high, fine, dante, refused, preferring, to, remain, in, exile, when, uguccione, defeated, florence, dante, s, death, sentence, was, commuted, to, house, arrest, on, condition, that, he, go, to, florence, to, swear, he, would, never, enter, the, town, again, he, refused, to, go, and, his, death, sentence, was, confirmed, and, extended, to, his, sons, despite, this, he, still, hoped, late, in, life, that, he, might, be, invited, back, to, florence, on, honorable, terms, particularly, in, praise, of, his, poetry, dante, s, final, days, were, spent, in, ravenna, where, he, had, been, invited, to, stay, in, the, city, in, 1318, by, its, prince, guido, ii, da, polenta, dante, died, in, ravenna, on, september, 14, 1321, aged, about, 56, of, quartan, malaria, contracted, while, returning, from, a, diplomatic, mission, to, the, republic, of, venice, he, was, attended, by, his, three, children, and, possibly, by, gemma, donati, and, by, friends, and, admirers, he, had, in, the, city, he, was, buried, in, ravenna, at, the, church, of, san, pier, maggiore, later, called, basilica, di, san, francesco, bernardo, bembo, praetor, of, venice, erected, a, tomb, for, him, in, 1483, on, the, grave, a, verse, of, bernardo, canaccio, a, friend, of, dante, is, dedicated, to, florence, parvi, florentia, mater, amoris, florence, mother, of, little, love, in, 1329, bertrand, du, pouget, cardinal, and, nephew, of, pope, john, xxii, classified, dante, s, monarchia, as, heretical, and, sought, to, have, his, bones, burned, at, the, stake, ostasio, i, da, polenta, and, pino, della, tosa, allies, of, pouget, interceded, to, prevent, the, destruction, of, dante, s, remains, florence, eventually, came, to, regret, having, exiled, dante, the, city, made, repeated, requests, for, the, return, of, his, remains, the, custodians, of, the, body, in, ravenna, refused, at, one, point, going, so, far, as, to, conceal, the, bones, in, a, false, wall, of, the, monastery, florence, built, a, tomb, for, dante, in, 1829, in, the, basilica, of, santa, croce, that, tomb, has, been, empty, ever, since, with, dante, s, body, remaining, in, ravenna, the, front, of, his, tomb, in, florence, reads, onorate, l, altissimo, poeta, which, roughly, translates, as, honor, the, most, exalted, poet, and, is, a, quote, from, the, fourth, canto, of, the, inferno, in, 1945, the, fascist, government, discussed, bringing, dante, s, remains, to, the, valtellina, redoubt, the, alpine, valley, in, which, the, regime, intended, to, make, its, last, stand, against, the, allies, the, case, was, made, that, the, greatest, symbol, of, italianness, should, be, present, at, fascism, s, heroic, end, but, ultimately, no, action, was, taken, a, copy, of, dante, s, so, called, death, mask, has, been, displayed, since, 1911, in, the, palazzo, vecchio, scholars, today, believe, it, is, not, a, true, death, mask, and, was, probably, carved, in, 1483, perhaps, by, pietro, and, tullio, lombardo, the, first, formal, biography, of, dante, was, the, vita, di, dante, also, known, as, trattatello, in, laude, di, dante, written, after, 1348, by, giovanni, boccaccio, although, several, statements, and, episodes, of, it, have, been, deemed, unreliable, on, the, basis, of, modern, research, an, earlier, account, of, dante, s, life, and, works, had, been, included, in, the, nuova, cronica, of, the, florentine, chronicler, giovanni, villani, some, 16th, century, english, protestants, such, as, john, bale, and, john, foxe, argued, that, dante, was, a, proto, protestant, because, of, his, opposition, to, the, pope, the, 19th, century, saw, a, dante, revival, a, product, of, the, medieval, revival, which, was, itself, an, important, aspect, of, romanticism, thomas, carlyle, profiled, him, in, the, hero, as, poet, the, third, lecture, in, on, heroes, hero, worship, the, heroic, in, history, 1841, he, is, world, great, not, because, he, is, worldwide, but, because, he, is, world, deep, dante, is, the, spokesman, of, the, middle, ages, the, thought, they, lived, by, stands, here, in, everlasting, music, leigh, hunt, henry, francis, cary, and, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, were, among, dante, s, translators, of, the, era, italy, s, first, dreadnought, battleship, was, completed, in, 1913, and, named, dante, alighieri, in, honor, of, him, on, april, 30, 1921, in, honor, of, the, 600th, anniversary, of, dante, s, death, pope, benedict, xv, promulgated, an, encyclical, named, in, praeclara, summorum, naming, dante, as, one, of, the, many, celebrated, geniuses, of, whom, the, catholic, faith, can, boast, and, the, pride, and, glory, of, humanity, on, december, 7, 1965, pope, paul, vi, promulgated, the, latin, motu, proprio, titled, altissimi, cantus, which, was, dedicated, to, dante, s, figure, and, poetry, in, that, year, the, pope, also, donated, a, golden, iron, greek, cross, to, dante, s,

of, his, love, for, beatrice, portinari, who, later, served, as, the, ultimate, symbol, of, salvation, in, the, comedy, a, function, already, indicated, in, the, final, pages, of, the, vita, nuova, the, work, contains, many, of, dante, s, love, poems, in, tuscan, which, was, not, unprecedented, the, vernacular, had, been, regularly, used, for, lyric, works, before, during, all, the, thirteenth, century, however, dante, s, commentary, on, his, own, work, is, also, in, the, vernacular, both, in, the, vita, nuova, and, in, the, convivio, instead, of, the, latin, that, was, almost, universally,

stature, and, the, range, both, stylistic, and, thematic, of, its, content, the, comedy, soon, became, a, cornerstone, in, the, evolution, of, italian, as, an, established, literary, language, dante, was, more, aware, than, most, early, italian, writers, of, the, variety, of, italian, dialects, and, of, the, need, to, create, a, literature, and, a, unified, literary, language, beyond, the, limits, of, latin, writing, at, the, time, in, that, sense, he, is, a, forerunner, of, the, renaissance, with, its, effort, to, create, vernacular, literature, in, competition, with, earlier, classical,

15th, century, he, wrote, the, comedy, in, a, language, he, called, italian, in, some, sense, an, amalgamated, literary, language, predominantly, based, on, the, regional, dialect, of, tuscany, but, with, some, elements, of, latin, and, other, regional, dialects, he, deliberately, aimed, to, reach, a, readership, throughout, italy, including, laymen, clergymen, and, other, poets, by, creating, a,

and, giovanni, boccaccio, to, break, free, from, standards, of, publishing, in, only, latin, the, language, of, liturgy, history, and, scholarship, in, general, but, often, also, of, lyric, poetry, this, break, set, a, precedent, and, allowed, more, literature, to, be, published, for, a, wider, audience, setting, the, stage, for, greater, levels, of, literacy, in, the, future, however, unlike, boccaccio, milton, or, ariosto, dante, did, not, really, become, an, author, read, across, europe, until, the, romantic, era, to, the, romantics, dante, like, homer, and, shakespeare, was, a, prime, example, of, the, original, genius, who, set, his, own, rules, created, persons, of, overpowering, stature, and, depth, and, went, beyond, any, imitation, of, the, patterns, of, earlier, masters, and, who, in, turn, could, not, truly, be, imitated, throughout, the, 19th, century, dante, s, reputation, grew, and, solidified, and, by, 1865, the, 600th, anniversary, of, his, birth, he, had, become,
