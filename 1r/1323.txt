successor, in, the, years, to, come, on, 29, june, 1881, muhammad, ahmad, claimed, to, be, the, mahdi, so, as, to, prepare, the, way, for, the, second, coming, of, jesus, in, part, his, claim, was, based, on, his, status, as, a, prominent, sufi, sheikh, with, a, large, following, in, the, samaniyya, order, and, among, the, tribes, in, the, area, around, aba, island, yet, the, idea, of, the, mahdiyya, had, been, central, to, the, belief, of, the, samaniyya, prior, to, muhammad, ahmad, s, pronouncement, the, previous, samaniyya, leader, sheikh, al, qurashi, wad, al, zayn, had, asserted, that, the, long, awaited, for, redeemer, would, come, from, the, samaniyya, line, according, to, sheikh, al, qurashi, the, mahdi, would, make, himself, known, through, a, number, of, signs, some, established, in, the, early, period, of, islam, and, recorded, in, the, hadith, literature, others, had, a, more, distinctly, local, origin, such, as, the, prediction, that, the, mahdi, would, ride, the, sheikh, s, pony, and, erect, a, dome, over, his, grave, after, his, death, drawing, from, aspects, of, the, sufi, tradition, that, were, intimately, familiar, to, both, his, followers, and, his, opponents, muhammad, ahmad, claimed, that, he, had, been, appointed, as, the, mahdi, by, a, prophetic, assembly, or, hadra, arabic, al, hadra, al, nabawiyya, a, hadra, in, the, sufi, tradition, is, a, gathering, of, all, the, prophets, from, the, time, of, adam, to, muhammad, as, well, as, many, sufi, holy, men, who, are, believed, to, have, reached, the, highest, level, of, affinity, with, the, divine, during, their, lifetime, the, hadra, is, chaired, by, muhammad, known, as, sayyid, al, wujud, and, at, his, side, are, the, seven, qutb, the, most, senior, of, whom, is, known, as, ghawth, az, zaman, the, hadra, was, also, the, source, of, a, number, of, central, beliefs, about, the, mahdi, including, that, he, was, created, from, the, sacred, light, at, the, centre, of, muhammad, s, heart, and, that, all, living, creatures, had, acknowledged, the, mahdi, s, claim, since, his, birth, muhammad, ahmad, framed, the, mahdiyya, as, a, return, to, the, early, days, of, islam, when, the, muslim, community, or, ummah, was, unified, under, the, guidance, of, muhammad, and, his, immediate, successors, later, in, order, to, distinguish, his, followers, from, adherents, of, other, sufi, sects, the, mahdi, forbade, the, use, of, the, word, darwish, commonly, known, as, dervish, in, english, to, describe, his, followers, replacing, it, with, the, title, ans, r, the, term, which, muhammad, used, for, the, people, of, medina, who, welcomed, him, and, his, followers, after, their, flight, from, mecca, despite, his, popularity, among, the, clerics, of, the, samaniyya, and, other, sects, and, among, the, tribes, of, western, sudan, some, of, the, ulema, or, orthodox, religious, authorities, rejected, muhammad, ahmad, s, claim, as, the, mahdi, among, his, most, prominent, critics, were, the, sudanese, ulema, loyal, to, the, ottoman, sultan, and, employed, by, the, turco, egyptian, government, examples, were, the, mufti, shakir, al, ghazi, who, sat, on, the, council, of, appeal, in, khartoum, and, the, qadi, ahmad, al, azhari, in, kordofan, these, critics, were, careful, not, to, deny, the, concept, of, the, mahdi, as, such, but, rather, to, discredit, muhammad, ahmad, s, claim, to, it, they, pointed, out, that, muhammad, ahmad, s, manifestation, did, not, conform, to, the, prophecies, laid, out, in, the, hadith, literature, in, particular, they, argued, for, the, political, interests, of, the, turco, egyptian, government, and, its, british, rulers, that, his, manifestation, did, not, conform, with, the, time, of, troubles, when, the, land, is, filled, with, oppression, tyranny, and, enmity, when, governor, general, muhammad, rauf, pasha, in, khartoum, learned, of, the, 29, june, 1881, declaration, by, muhammad, ahmad, as, the, mahdi, he, believed, that, the, man, would, be, satisfied, with, a, government, pension, and, he, sent, ahmad, a, friendly, letter, the, mahdi, telegraphed, an, uncompromising, reply, saying, he, who, does, not, believe, in, me, will, be, purified, by, the, sword, mohammed, rauf, pasha, sent, a, small, party, to, arrest, the, mahdi, on, aba, island, but, on, 11, august, 1881, it, was, overwhelmed, and, the, insurrection, in, southern, sudan, began, to, grow, rauf, pasha, downplayed, the, affray, in, his, report, to, cairo, and, sent, the, governor, of, kordofan, to, aba, island, with, 1, 000, soldiers, to, crush, the, mahdi, when, they, arrived, they, found, the, mahdi, had, fled, to, the, southwest, the, soldiers, marched, after, him, but, gave, up, the, pursuit, when, the, september, rains, flooded, the, roads, and, riverbeds, they, returned, to, el, obeid, the, mahdi, established, a, new, base, in, the, nuba, mountains, the, mahdi, and, a, party, of, his, followers, the, ans, r, helpers, known, in, the, west, as, the, dervishes, made, a, long, march, to, kurdufan, there, he, gained, numerous, recruits, especially, from, the, baqqara, and, notable, leaders, such, as, sheikh, madibbo, ibn, ali, of, the, rizeigat, and, abdallahi, ibn, muhammad, of, the, ta, aisha, tribes, they, were, also, joined, by, the, hadendoa, beja, who, were, rallied, to, the, mahdi, in, 1883, by, osman, digna, an, ans, r, captain, in, eastern, sudan, the, mahdist, revolution, was, backed, by, the, northern, and, western, regions, of, sudan, it, also, found, great, support, from, the, nuer, shilluk, and, anuak, tribes, of, southern, sudan, in, addition, to, the, tribes, of, bahr, alghazal, this, widespread, support, affirmed, that, the, mahdist, revolution, was, a, national, rather, than, regional, revolution, in, addition, to, unifying, different, tribes, the, revolution, cut, across, religious, divides, despite, its, religious, origins, the, mahdi, was, supported, by, non, muslims, and, muslims, alike, this, had, important, implications, for, the, slave, trade, going, against, traditional, islamic, injunctions, the, mahdi, allowed, the, enslavement, of, free, muslims, if, they, did, not, support, him, and, forbade, the, enslavement, of, traditional, victims, non, muslims, if, they, supported, him, late, in, 1883, the, ans, r, armed, only, with, spears, and, swords, overwhelmed, a, 4, 000, man, egyptian, force, not, far, from, el, obeid, and, seized, their, rifles, and, ammunition, the, mahdi, followed, up, this, victory, by, laying, siege, to, el, obeid, and, starving, it, into, submission, after, four, months, the, town, remained, the, headquarters, of, the, ans, r, for, much, of, the, decade, the, ans, r, now, 40, 000, strong, defeated, an, 8, 000, man, egyptian, relief, force, led, by, british, officer, william, hicks, near, kashgil, in, the, battle, of, shaykan, the, defeat, of, hicks, also, resulted, in, the, fall, of, darfur, to, the, ans, r, which, until, then, had, been, effectively, defended, by, rudolf, carl, von, slatin, jabal, qadir, in, the, south, was, also, taken, the, western, half, of, sudan, was, now, firmly, in, ans, r, hands, their, success, emboldened, the, hadendoa, who, under, the, generalship, of, osman, digna, wiped, out, a, smaller, force, of, egyptians, under, the, command, of, colonel, valentine, baker, near, the, red, sea, port, of, suakin, major, general, gerald, graham, was, sent, with, a, force, of, 4, 000, british, soldiers, and, defeated, digna, at, el, teb, on, 29, february, two, weeks, later, he, suffered, high, casualties, at, tamai, and, graham, eventually, withdrew, his, forces, after, much, debate, the, british, decided, to, abandon, sudan, in, december, 1883, holding, only, several, northern, towns, and, red, sea, ports, such, as, khartoum, kassala, sannar, and, sawakin, the, evacuation, of, egyptian, troops, and, officials, and, other, foreigners, from, sudan, was, assigned, to, general, charles, george, gordon, who, had, been, reappointed, governor, general, with, orders, to, return, to, khartoum, and, organize, a, withdrawal, of, the, egyptian, garrisons, there, gordon, reached, khartoum, in, february, 1884, at, first, he, was, greeted, with, jubilation, as, many, of, the, tribes, in, the, immediate, area, were, at, odds, with, the, mahdists, transportation, northward, was, still, open, and, the, telegraph, lines, intact, but, the, uprising, of, the, beja, soon, after, his, arrival, changed, things, considerably, reducing, communications, to, runners, gordon, considered, the, routes, northward, to, be, too, dangerous, to, extricate, the, garrisons, and, so, pressed, for, reinforcements, to, be, sent, from, cairo, to, help, with, the, withdrawal, he, also, suggested, that, his, old, enemy, al, zubayr, rahma, mansur, a, fine, military, commander, be, given, tacit, control, of, the, sudan, in, order, to, provide, a, counter, to, the, ans, r, london, rejected, both, proposals, and, so, gordon, prepared, for, a, fight, in, march, 1884, gordon, tried, to, stage, an, offensive, to, clear, the, road, northward, to, egypt, but, a, number, of, the, officers, in, the, egyptian, force, went, over, to, the, enemy, and, their, forces, fled, the, field, after, firing, a, single, salvo, this, convinced, him, that, he, could, carry, out, only, defensive, operations, and, he, returned, to, khartoum, to, construct, defensive, works, by, april, 1884, gordon, had, managed, to, evacuate, some, 2, 500, of, the, foreign, population, who, had, been, able, to, make, the, trek, northwards, his, mobile, force, under, colonel, stewart, returned, to, khartoum, after, repeated, incidents, when, the, 200, or, so, egyptian, forces, under, his, command, would, turn, and, run, at, the, slightest, provocation, that, month, the, ans, r, besieged, khartoum, and, gordon, was, completely, cut, off, but, his, defensive, works, consisting, mainly, of, mines, proved, so, frightening, to, the, ans, r, that, they, were, unable, to, penetrate, the, city, once, the, waters, rose, stewart, used, gunboats, on, the, nile, to, conduct, several, small, skirmishes, and, in, august, managed, to, recapture, berber, for, a, short, time, but, stewart, was, killed, soon, after, in, another, foray, from, berber, to, dongola, a, fact, gordon, learned, only, in, a, letter, from, the, mahdi, himself, under, increasing, pressure, from, the, public, to, support, gordon, the, british, government, under, prime, minister, gladstone, eventually, had, ordered, lord, garnet, joseph, wolseley, to, relieve, gordon, he, was, already, deployed, in, egypt, due, to, the, attempted, coup, there, earlier, and, organized, a, large, force, of, infantry, but, advanced,
