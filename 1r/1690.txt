friedrich, w, hler, german, frs, for, hon, frse, 31, july, 1800, 23, september, 1882, was, a, german, chemist, known, for, his, work, in, both, organic, and, inorganic, chemistry, being, the, first, to, isolate, the, chemical, elements, beryllium, and, yttrium, in, pure, metallic, form, he, was, the, first, to, prepare, several, inorganic, compounds, including, silane, and, silicon, nitride, w, hler, is, also, known, for, seminal, contributions, in, organic, chemistry, in, particular, the, w, hler, synthesis, of, urea, his, synthesis, of, the, organic, compound, urea, in, the, laboratory, from, inorganic, substances, contradicted, the, belief, that, organic, compounds, could, only, be, produced, by, living, organisms, due, to, a, life, force, however, the, exact, extent, of, w, hler, s, role, in, diminishing, the, belief, in, vitalism, is, considered, by, some, to, be, questionable, friedrich, w, hler, was, born, in, eschersheim, germany, and, was, the, son, of, a, veterinarian, as, a, boy, he, showed, interest, in, mineral, collecting, drawing, and, science, his, secondary, education, was, at, the, frankfurt, gymnasium, during, his, time, at, the, gymnasium, w, hler, began, chemical, experimentation, in, a, home, laboratory, provided, by, his, father, he, began, his, higher, education, at, marburg, university, in, 1820, on, 2, september, 1823, w, hler, passed, his, examinations, as, a, doctor, of, medicine, surgery, and, obstetrics, at, heidelberg, university, having, studied, in, the, laboratory, of, chemist, leopold, gmelin, gmelin, encouraged, him, to, focus, on, chemistry, and, arranged, for, w, hler, to, conduct, research, under, the, direction, of, chemist, jacob, berzelius, in, stockholm, sweden, w, hler, s, time, in, stockholm, with, berzelius, marked, the, beginning, of, a, long, personal, and, professional, relationship, between, the, two, scientists, w, hler, translated, many, of, berzelius, s, scientific, writings, into, german, for, international, publication, in, his, lifetime, w, hler, wrote, about, 275, books, editions, and, papers, from, 1826, to, 1831, w, hler, taught, chemistry, at, the, gewerbeschule, in, berlin, from, 1831, until, 1836, he, taught, at, the, h, here, gewerbeschule, at, kassel, in, the, spring, of, 1836, w, hler, became, friedrich, stromeyer, s, successor, as, an, ordinary, professor, of, chemistry, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, where, he, occupied, the, chair, of, chemistry, for, 46, years, until, his, death, in, 1882, during, his, time, at, g, ttingen, approximately, 8000, research, students, were, trained, in, his, laboratory, in, 1834, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, w, hler, investigated, more, than, twenty, five, chemical, elements, during, his, career, hans, christian, rsted, was, the, first, to, separate, the, element, aluminium, in, 1825, using, a, reduction, of, aluminium, chloride, with, a, potassium, amalgam, although, rsted, published, his, findings, on, the, isolation, of, aluminium, in, the, form, of, small, particles, no, other, investigators, successfully, replicated, his, findings, until, 1936, rsted, is, now, credited, with, discovering, aluminium, rsted, s, findings, on, aluminium, preparation, were, developed, further, by, w, hler, with, rsted, s, permission, w, hler, modified, rsted, s, methods, substituting, potassium, metal, for, potassium, amalgam, for, the, reduction, of, aluminium, chloride, using, this, improved, method, w, hler, isolated, aluminium, powder, in, pure, form, on, 22, october, 1827, he, showed, that, the, aluminium, powder, could, convert, to, solid, balls, of, pure, metallic, aluminium, in, 1845, for, this, work, w, hler, is, credited, with, the, first, isolation, of, aluminium, in, pure, form, in, 1828, w, hler, was, the, first, to, isolate, the, element, beryllium, in, pure, metallic, form, also, independently, isolated, by, antoine, bussy, in, the, same, year, he, became, the, first, to, isolate, the, element, yttrium, in, pure, metallic, form, he, achieved, these, preparations, by, heating, the, anhydrous, chlorides, of, beryllium, and, yttrium, with, potassium, metal, in, 1850, w, hler, determined, that, what, was, believed, until, then, to, be, metallic, titanium, was, a, mixture, of, titanium, carbon, and, nitrogen, from, which, he, derived, the, purest, form, isolated, to, that, time, elemental, titanium, was, later, isolated, in, completely, pure, form, in, 1910, by, matthew, a, hunter, he, also, developed, a, chemical, synthesis, of, calcium, carbide, and, silicon, nitride, w, hler, working, with, french, chemist, sainte, claire, deville, isolated, the, element, boron, in, a, crystalline, form, he, also, isolated, the, element, silicon, in, a, crystalline, form, crystalline, forms, of, these, two, elements, were, previously, unknown, in, 1856, working, with, heinrich, buff, w, hler, prepared, the, inorganic, compound, silane, sih, 4, he, prepared, the, first, samples, of, boron, nitride, by, melting, together, boric, acid, and, potassium, cyanide, he, also, developed, a, method, for, the, preparation, of, calcium, carbide, w, hler, had, an, interest, in, the, chemical, composition, of, meteorites, he, showed, that, some, meteoric, stones, contain, organic, matter, he, analyzed, meteorites, and, for, many, years, wrote, the, digest, on, the, literature, of, meteorites, in, the, jahresberichte, ber, die, fortschritte, der, chemie, w, hler, accumulated, the, best, private, collection, of, meteoric, stones, and, irons, that, existed, in, 1832, lacking, his, own, laboratory, facilities, at, kassel, w, hler, worked, with, justus, liebig, in, his, giessen, laboratory, in, that, year, w, hler, and, liebig, published, an, investigation, of, the, oil, of, bitter, almonds, through, their, detailed, analysis, of, the, chemical, composition, of, this, oil, they, proved, by, their, experiments, that, a, group, of, carbon, hydrogen, and, oxygen, atoms, can, behave, chemically, as, if, it, were, the, equivalent, of, a, single, atom, take, the, place, of, an, atom, in, a, chemical, compound, and, be, exchanged, for, other, atoms, in, chemical, compounds, specifically, their, research, on, the, oil, of, bitter, almonds, showed, that, a, group, of, elements, with, the, chemical, composition, c, 7, h, 5, o, can, be, thought, of, as, a, single, functional, group, which, came, to, be, known, as, a, benzoyl, radical, in, this, way, the, investigations, of, w, hler, and, liebig, established, a, new, concept, in, organic, chemistry, referred, to, as, compound, radicals, which, had, a, profound, influence, on, the, development, of, organic, chemistry, many, more, functional, groups, were, later, identified, by, subsequent, investigators, with, wide, utility, in, chemistry, liebig, and, w, hler, explored, the, concept, of, chemical, isomerism, the, idea, that, two, chemical, compounds, with, identical, chemical, compositions, could, be, different, substances, because, of, different, arrangements, of, the, atoms, in, the, chemical, structure, aspects, of, chemical, isomerism, originated, in, the, research, of, berzelius, liebig, and, w, hler, investigated, silver, fulminate, and, silver, cyanate, these, two, compounds, have, the, same, chemical, composition, yet, are, chemically, different, silver, fulminate, is, explosive, while, silver, cyanate, is, a, stable, compound, liebig, and, w, hler, recognized, these, as, examples, of, structural, isomerism, which, was, a, significant, advance, in, understanding, chemical, isomerism, w, hler, has, also, been, regarded, as, a, pioneering, researcher, in, organic, chemistry, as, a, result, of, his, 1828, demonstration, of, the, laboratory, synthesis, of, urea, from, ammonium, cyanate, in, a, chemical, reaction, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, w, hler, synthesis, urea, and, ammonium, cyanate, are, further, examples, of, structural, isomers, of, chemical, compounds, heating, ammonium, cyanate, converts, it, into, urea, which, is, its, isomer, in, a, letter, to, swedish, chemist, j, ns, jacob, berzelius, the, same, year, he, wrote, in, a, manner, of, speaking, i, can, no, longer, hold, my, chemical, water, i, must, tell, you, that, i, can, make, urea, without, the, use, of, kidneys, of, any, animal, be, it, man, or, dog, w, hler, s, demonstration, of, urea, synthesis, has, become, regarded, as, a, refutation, of, vitalism, the, hypothesis, that, living, things, are, alive, because, of, some, special, vital, force, it, was, the, beginning, of, the, end, for, one, popular, vitalist, hypothesis, the, idea, that, organic, compounds, could, be, made, only, by, living, things, in, responding, to, w, hler, j, ns, jakob, berzelius, acknowledged, that, w, hler, s, results, were, highly, significant, for, the, understanding, of, organic, chemistry, calling, the, findings, a, jewel, for, w, hler, s, laurel, wreath, both, scientists, also, recognized, the, work, s, importance, to, the, study, of, isomerism, a, new, area, of, research, w, hler, s, role, in, overturning, vitalism, is, said, to, have, become, exaggerated, over, time, this, tendency, can, be, traced, back, to, hermann, kopp, s, history, of, chemistry, in, four, volumes, 1843, 1847, he, emphasized, the, importance, of, w, hler, s, research, as, a, refutation, of, vitalism, but, ignored, its, importance, in, understanding, chemical, isomerism, setting, a, tone, for, subsequent, writers, the, notion, that, w, hler, single, handedly, overturned, vitalism, also, gained, popularity, after, it, appeared, in, a, popular, history, of, chemistry, published, in, 1931, which, ignoring, all, pretense, of, historical, accuracy, turned, w, hler, into, a, crusader, contrary, to, what, was, thought, in, w, hler, s, time, cyanate, is, not, a, purely, inorganic, anion, as, it, is, formed, in, various, metabolic, pathways, thus, the, conversion, of, ammonium, cyanate, into, urea, was, not, an, example, of, production, of, an, organic, compound, from, an, inorganic, precursor, once, w, hler, became, a, professor, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, students, traveled, from, around, the, world, to, be, instructed, by, him, w, hler, saw, particular, success, in, his, students, after, giving, them, hands, on, experience, in, the, lab, this, practice, was, later, adopted, around, the, world, becoming, the, chemistry, lab, co, requisite, that, is, required, at, most, universities, today, w, hler, also, allowed, his, students, to, participate, and, aid, him, in, his, research, which, was, not, typical, at, the, time, this, practice, became, nearly, universal, normalizing, the, undergraduate, and, graduate, level, research, that, is, a, requirement, for, numerous, degrees, today, w, hler, s, discoveries, had, a, significant, influence, on, the, theoretical, basis, of, chemistry, the, journals, of, every, year, from, 1820, to, 1881, contain, his, original, scientific, contributions, the, scientific, american, supplement, for, 1882, stated, that, for, two, or, three, of, his, researches, he, deserves, the, highest, honor, a, scientific, man, can, obtain, but, the, sum, of, his, work, is, overwhelming, had, he, never, lived, the, aspect, of, chemistry, would, be, very, different, from, that, it, is, now, w, hler, s, notable, research, students, included, chemists, georg, ludwig, carius, heinrich, limpricht, rudolph, fittig, adolph, wilhelm, hermann, kolbe, albert, niemann, vojt, ch, afa, k, wilhelm, k, hne, and, augustus, voelcker, w, hler, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, of, london, in, 1854, he, was, an, honorary, fellow, of, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, in, 1862, w, hler, was, elected, a, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, the, life, and, work, of, friedrich, w, hler, 1800, 1882, 2005, by, robin, keen, is, considered, to, be, the, first, detailed, scientific, biography, of, w, hler, on, the, 100th, anniversary, of, w, hler, s, death, the, west, german, government, issued, a, stamp, depicting, the, structure, of, urea, with, its, synthesis, formula, listed, directly, below, w, hler, s, first, marriage, was, in, 1828, to, his, cousin, franziska, maria, w, hler, 1811, 1832, the, couple, had, two, children, a, son, august, and, a, daughter, sophie, after, franziska, s, death, he, married, julie, pfeiffer, 1813, 1886, in, 1834, with, whom, he, had, four, daughters, fanny, helene, emilie, and, pauline, further, works, from, w, hler
