abraham, harold, maslow, m, z, l, o, april, 1, 1908, june, 8, 1970, was, an, american, psychologist, who, created, maslow, s, hierarchy, of, needs, a, theory, of, psychological, health, predicated, on, fulfilling, innate, human, needs, in, priority, culminating, in, self, actualization, maslow, was, a, psychology, professor, at, brandeis, university, brooklyn, college, new, school, for, social, research, and, columbia, university, he, stressed, the, importance, of, focusing, on, the, positive, qualities, in, people, as, opposed, to, treating, them, as, a, bag, of, symptoms, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, maslow, as, the, tenth, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, born, in, 1908, and, raised, in, brooklyn, new, york, maslow, was, the, oldest, of, seven, children, his, parents, were, first, generation, jewish, immigrants, from, kiev, then, part, of, the, russian, empire, now, kyiv, ukraine, who, fled, from, czarist, persecution, in, the, early, 20th, century, they, had, decided, to, live, in, new, york, city, and, in, a, multiethnic, working, class, neighborhood, his, parents, were, poor, and, not, intellectually, focused, but, they, valued, education, he, had, various, encounters, with, antisemitic, gangs, who, would, chase, and, throw, rocks, at, him, maslow, and, other, young, people, with, his, background, were, struggling, to, overcome, such, acts, of, racism, and, ethnic, prejudice, in, the, attempt, to, establish, an, idealistic, world, based, on, widespread, education, and, economic, justice, the, tension, outside, his, home, was, also, felt, within, it, as, he, rarely, got, along, with, his, mother, and, eventually, developed, a, strong, revulsion, towards, her, he, is, quoted, as, saying, what, i, had, reacted, to, was, not, only, her, physical, appearance, but, also, her, values, and, world, view, her, stinginess, her, total, selfishness, her, lack, of, love, for, anyone, else, in, the, world, even, her, own, husband, and, children, her, narcissism, her, negro, prejudice, her, exploitation, of, everyone, her, assumption, that, anyone, was, wrong, who, disagreed, with, her, her, lack, of, friends, her, sloppiness, and, dirtiness, he, also, grew, up, with, few, friends, other, than, his, cousin, will, and, as, a, result, grew, up, in, libraries, and, among, books, it, was, here, that, he, developed, his, love, for, reading, and, learning, he, went, to, boys, high, school, one, of, the, top, high, schools, in, brooklyn, where, his, best, friend, was, his, cousin, will, maslow, here, he, served, as, the, officer, to, many, academic, clubs, and, became, editor, of, the, latin, magazine, he, also, edited, principia, the, school, s, physics, paper, for, a, year, he, developed, other, strengths, as, well, as, a, young, boy, maslow, believed, physical, strength, to, be, the, single, most, defining, characteristic, of, a, true, male, hence, he, exercised, often, and, took, up, weight, lifting, in, hopes, of, being, transformed, into, a, more, muscular, tough, looking, guy, however, he, was, unable, to, achieve, this, due, to, his, humble, looking, and, chaste, figure, as, well, as, his, studiousness, maslow, attended, the, city, college, of, new, york, after, high, school, in, 1926, he, began, taking, legal, studies, classes, at, night, in, addition, to, his, undergraduate, course, load, he, hated, it, and, almost, immediately, dropped, out, in, 1927, he, transferred, to, cornell, but, he, left, after, just, one, semester, due, to, poor, grades, and, high, costs, he, later, graduated, from, city, college, and, went, to, graduate, school, at, the, university, of, wisconsin, to, study, psychology, in, 1928, he, married, his, first, cousin, bertha, who, was, still, in, high, school, at, the, time, the, pair, had, met, in, brooklyn, years, earlier, maslow, s, psychology, training, at, uw, was, decidedly, experimental, behaviorist, at, wisconsin, he, pursued, a, line, of, research, which, included, investigating, primate, dominance, behavior, and, sexuality, maslow, s, early, experience, with, behaviorism, would, leave, him, with, a, strong, positivist, mindset, upon, the, recommendation, of, professor, hulsey, cason, maslow, wrote, his, master, s, thesis, on, learning, retention, and, reproduction, of, verbal, material, maslow, regarded, the, research, as, embarrassingly, trivial, but, he, completed, his, thesis, the, summer, of, 1931, and, was, awarded, his, master, s, degree, in, psychology, he, was, so, ashamed, of, the, thesis, that, he, removed, it, from, the, psychology, library, and, tore, out, its, catalog, listing, however, professor, cason, admired, the, research, enough, to, urge, maslow, to, submit, it, for, publication, maslow, s, thesis, was, published, as, two, articles, in, 1934, maslow, continued, his, research, at, columbia, university, on, similar, themes, there, he, found, another, mentor, in, alfred, adler, one, of, sigmund, freud, s, early, colleagues, from, 1937, to, 1951, maslow, was, on, the, faculty, of, brooklyn, college, his, family, life, and, his, experiences, influenced, his, psychological, ideas, after, world, war, ii, maslow, began, to, question, the, way, psychologists, had, come, to, their, conclusions, and, although, he, did, not, completely, disagree, he, had, his, own, ideas, on, how, to, understand, the, human, mind, he, called, his, new, discipline, humanistic, psychology, maslow, was, already, a, 33, year, old, father, and, had, two, children, when, the, united, states, entered, world, war, ii, in, 1941, he, was, thus, ineligible, for, the, military, however, the, horrors, of, war, inspired, a, vision, of, peace, in, him, leading, to, his, groundbreaking, psychological, studies, of, self, actualizing, the, studies, began, under, the, supervision, of, two, mentors, anthropologist, ruth, benedict, and, gestalt, psychologist, max, wertheimer, whom, he, admired, both, professionally, and, personally, they, accomplished, a, lot, in, both, realms, being, such, wonderful, human, beings, as, well, they, inspired, maslow, to, take, notes, about, them, and, their, behavior, this, would, be, the, basis, of, his, lifelong, research, and, thinking, about, mental, health, and, human, potential, maslow, extended, the, subject, borrowing, ideas, from, other, psychologists, and, adding, new, ones, such, as, the, concepts, of, a, hierarchy, of, needs, metaneeds, metamotivation, self, actualizing, persons, and, peak, experiences, he, was, a, professor, at, brandeis, university, from, 1951, to, 1969, he, became, a, resident, fellow, of, the, laughlin, institute, in, california, in, 1967, maslow, had, a, serious, heart, attack, and, knew, his, time, was, limited, he, considered, himself, to, be, a, psychological, pioneer, he, gave, future, psychologists, a, push, by, bringing, to, light, different, paths, to, ponder, he, built, the, framework, that, later, allowed, other, psychologists, to, conduct, more, comprehensive, studies, maslow, believed, that, leadership, should, be, non, intervening, consistent, with, this, approach, he, rejected, a, nomination, in, 1963, to, be, the, president, of, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, because, he, felt, that, the, organization, should, develop, an, intellectual, movement, without, a, leader, while, jogging, maslow, had, a, severe, heart, attack, and, died, on, june, 8, 1970, at, the, age, of, 62, in, menlo, park, california, he, is, buried, at, mount, auburn, cemetery, most, psychologists, before, him, had, been, concerned, with, the, abnormal, and, the, ill, he, urged, people, to, acknowledge, their, basic, needs, before, addressing, higher, needs, and, ultimately, self, actualization, he, wanted, to, know, what, constituted, positive, mental, health, humanistic, psychology, gave, rise, to, several, different, therapies, all, guided, by, the, idea, that, people, possess, the, inner, resources, for, growth, and, healing, and, that, the, point, of, therapy, is, to, help, remove, obstacles, to, individuals, achieving, them, the, most, famous, of, these, was, client, centered, therapy, developed, by, carl, rogers, the, basic, principles, behind, humanistic, psychology, are, simple, humanistic, psychology, theory, suits, people, who, see, the, positive, side, of, humanity, and, believe, in, free, will, this, theory, clearly, contrasts, with, freud, s, theory, of, biological, determinism, another, significant, strength, is, that, humanistic, psychology, theory, is, compatible, with, other, schools, of, thought, maslow, s, hierarchy, is, also, applicable, to, other, topics, such, as, finance, economics, or, even, in, history, or, criminology, humanist, psychology, also, coined, positive, psychology, is, criticized, for, its, lack, of, empirical, validation, and, therefore, its, lack, of, usefulness, in, treating, specific, problems, it, may, also, fail, to, help, or, diagnose, people, who, have, severe, mental, disorders, humanistic, psychologists, believe, that, every, person, has, a, strong, desire, to, realize, their, full, potential, to, reach, a, level, of, self, actualization, the, main, point, of, that, new, movement, that, reached, its, peak, in, 1960s, was, to, emphasize, the, positive, potential, of, human, beings, maslow, positioned, his, work, as, a, vital, complement, to, that, of, freud, it, is, as, if, freud, supplied, us, the, sick, half, of, psychology, and, we, must, now, fill, it, out, with, the, healthy, half, however, maslow, was, highly, critical, of, freud, since, humanistic, psychologists, did, not, recognize, spirituality, as, a, navigation, for, our, behaviors, to, prove, that, humans, are, not, blindly, reacting, to, situations, but, trying, to, accomplish, something, greater, maslow, studied, mentally, healthy, individuals, instead, of, people, with, serious, psychological, issues, he, focused, on, self, actualizing, people, self, actualizing, people, indicate, a, coherent, personality, syndrome, and, represent, optimal, psychological, health, and, functioning, this, informed, his, theory, that, a, person, enjoys, peak, experiences, high, points, in, life, when, the, individual, is, in, harmony, with, themself, and, their, surroundings, in, maslow, s, view, self, actualized, people, can, have, many, peak, experiences, throughout, a, day, while, others, have, those, experiences, less, frequently, he, believed, that, psychedelic, drugs, like, lsd, and, psilocybin, can, produce, peak, experiences, in, the, right, people, under, the, right, circumstances, beyond, the, routine, of, needs, fulfillment, maslow, envisioned, moments, of, extraordinary, experience, known, as, peak, experiences, which, are, profound, moments, of, love, understanding, happiness, or, rapture, during, which, a, person, feels, more, whole, alive, self, sufficient, and, yet, a, part, of, the, world, more, aware, of, truth, justice, harmony, goodness, and, so, on, self, actualizing, people, are, more, likely, to, have, peak, experiences, in, other, words, these, peak, experiences, or, states, of, flow, are, the, reflections, of, the, realization, of, one, s, human, potential, and, represent, the, height, of, personality, development, in, later, writings, maslow, moved, to, a, more, inclusive, model, that, allowed, for, in, addition, to, intense, peak, experiences, longer, lasting, periods, of, serene, being, cognition, that, he, termed, plateau, experiences, he, borrowed, this, term, from, the, indian, scientist, and, yoga, practitioner, u, a, asrani, with, whom, he, corresponded, maslow, stated, that, the, shift, from, the, peak, to, the, plateau, experience, is, related, to, the, natural, aging, process, in, which, an, individual, has, a, shift, in, life, values, about, what, is, actually, important, in, one, s, life, and, what, is, not, important, in, spite, of, the, personal, significance, with, the, plateau, experience, maslow, was, not, able, to, conduct, a, comprehensive, study, of, this, phenomenon, due, to, health, problems, that, developed, toward, the, end, of, his, life, in, studying, accounts, of, peak, experiences, maslow, identified, a, manner, of, thought, he, called, being, cognition, or, b, cognition, which, is, holistic, and, accepting, as, opposed, to, the, evaluative, deficiency, cognition, or, d, cognition, and, values, he, called, being, values, he, listed, the, b, values, as, maslow, described, human, needs, as, ordered, in, a, prepotent, hierarchy, a, pressing, need, would, need, to, be, mostly, satisfied, before, someone, would, give, their, attention, to, the, next, highest, need, none, of, his, published, works, included, a, visual, representation, of, the, hierarchy, the, pyramidal, diagram, illustrating, the, maslow, needs, hierarchy, may, have, been, created, by, a, psychology, textbook, publisher, as, an, illustrative, device, this, now, iconic, pyramid, frequently, depicts, the, spectrum, of, human, needs, both, physical, and, psychological, as, accompaniment, to, articles, describing, maslow, s, needs, theory, and, may, give, the, impression, that, the, hierarchy, of, needs, is, a, fixed, and, rigid, sequence, of, progression, yet, starting, with, the, first, publication, of, his, theory, in, 1943, maslow, described, human, needs, as, being, relatively, fluid, with, many, needs, being, present, in, a, person, simultaneously, the, hierarchy, of, human, needs, model, suggests, that, human, needs, will, only, be, fulfilled, one, level, at, a, time, according, to, maslow, s, theory, when, a, human, being, ascends, the, levels, of, the, hierarchy, having, fulfilled, the, needs, in, the, hierarchy, one, may, eventually, achieve, self, actualization, late, in, life, maslow, came, to, conclude, that, self, actualization, was, not, an, automatic, outcome, of, satisfying, the, other, human, needs, human, needs, as, identified, by, maslow, the, first, four, levels, are, known, as, deficit, needs, or, d, needs, this, means, that, if, there, are, not, enough, of, one, of, those, four, needs, there, will, be, a, need, to, get, it, getting, them, brings, a, feeling, of, contentment, these, needs, alone, are, not, motivating, maslow, wrote, that, there, are, certain, conditions, that, must, be, fulfilled, in, order, for, the, basic, needs, to, be, satisfied, for, example, freedom, of, speech, freedom, to, express, oneself, and, freedom, to, seek, new, information, are, a, few, of, the, prerequisites, any, blockages, of, these, freedoms, could, prevent, the, satisfaction, of, the, basic, needs, maslow, s, hierarchy, is, used, in, higher, education, for, advising, students, and, for, student, retention, as, well, as, a, key, concept, in, student, development, maslow, s, hierarchy, has, been, subject, to, internet, memes, over, the, past, few, years, specifically, looking, at, the, modern, integration, of, technology, in, people, s, lives, and, humorously, suggesting, that, wi, fi, was, among, the, most, basic, of, human, needs, maslow, defined, self, actualization, as, achieving, the, fullest, use, of, one, s, talents, and, interests, the, need, to, become, everything, that, one, is, capable, of, becoming, as, implied, by, its, name, self, actualization, is, highly, individualistic, and, reflects, maslow, s, premise, that, the, self, is, sovereign, and, inviolable, and, entitled, to, his, or, her, own, tastes, opinions, values, etc, indeed, some, have, characterized, self, actualization, as, healthy, narcissism, maslow, realized, that, the, self, actualizing, individuals, he, studied, had, similar, personality, traits, maslow, selected, individuals, based, on, his, subjective, view, of, them, as, self, actualized, people, some, of, the, people, he, studied, included, thomas, jefferson, abraham, lincoln, and, eleanor, roosevelt, in, his, daily, journal, 1961, 63, maslow, wrote, eupsychia, club, heroes, that, i, write, for, my, judges, the, ones, i, want, to, please, jefferson, spinoza, socrates, aristotle, james, bergson, norman, thomas, upton, sinclair, both, heroes, of, my, youth, all, were, reality, centered, able, to, differentiate, what, was, fraudulent, from, what, was, genuine, they, were, also, problem, centered, meaning, that, they, treated, life, s, difficulties, as, problems, that, demanded, solutions, these, individuals, also, were, comfortable, being, alone, and, had, healthy, personal, relationships, they, had, only, a, few, close, friends, and, family, rather, than, a, large, number, of, shallow, relationships, self, actualizing, people, tend, to, focus, on, problems, outside, themselves, have, a, clear, sense, of, what, is, true, and, what, is, false, are, spontaneous, and, creative, and, are, not, bound, too, strictly, by, social, conventions, maslow, noticed, that, self, actualized, individuals, had, a, better, insight, of, reality, deeply, accepted, themselves, others, and, the, world, and, also, had, faced, many, problems, and, were, known, to, be, impulsive, people, these, self, actualized, individuals, were, very, independent, and, private, when, it, came, to, their, environment, and, culture, especially, their, very, own, individual, development, on, potentialities, and, inner, resources, according, to, maslow, self, actualizing, people, share, the, following, qualities, maslow, based, his, theory, partially, on, his, own, assumptions, about, human, potential, and, partially, on, his, case, studies, of, historical, figures, whom, he, believed, to, be, self, actualized, including, albert, einstein, and, henry, david, thoreau, consequently, maslow, argued, the, way, in, which, essential, needs, are, fulfilled, is, just, as, important, as, the, needs, themselves, together, these, define, the, human, experience, to, the, extent, a, person, finds, cooperative, social, fulfillment, he, establishes, meaningful, relationships, with, other, people, and, the, larger, world, in, other, words, he, establishes, meaningful, connections, to, an, external, reality, an, essential, component, of, self, actualization, in, contrast, to, the, extent, that, vital, needs, find, selfish, and, competitive, fulfillment, a, person, acquires, hostile, emotions, and, limited, external, relationships, his, awareness, remains, internal, and, limited, maslow, used, the, term, metamotivation, to, describe, self, actualized, people, who, are, driven, by, innate, forces, beyond, their, basic, needs, so, that, they, may, explore, and, reach, their, full, human, potential, maslow, s, theory, of, motivation, gave, insight, on, individuals, having, the, ability, to, be, motivated, by, a, calling, mission, or, life, purpose, it, is, noted, that, metamotivation, may, also, be, connected, to, what, maslow, called, b, being, creativity, which, is, a, creativity, that, comes, from, being, motivated, by, a, higher, stage, of, growth, another, type, of, creativity, that, was, described, by, maslow, is, known, as, d, deficiency, creativity, which, suggests, that, creativity, results, from, an, individual, s, need, to, fill, a, gap, that, is, left, by, an, unsatisfied, primary, need, or, the, need, for, assurance, and, acceptance, maslow, based, his, study, on, the, writings, of, other, psychologists, albert, einstein, and, people, he, knew, who, clearly, met, the, standard, of, self, actualization, maslow, used, einstein, s, writings, and, accomplishments, to, exemplify, the, characteristics, of, the, self, actualized, person, ruth, benedict, and, max, wertheimer, work, was, also, very, influential, to, maslow, s, models, of, self, actualization, in, this, case, from, a, quantitative, sciences, perspective, there, are, numerous, problems, with, this, particular, approach, which, has, caused, much, criticism, first, it, could, be, argued, that, biographical, analysis, as, a, method, is, extremely, subjective, as, it, is, based, entirely, on, the, opinion, of, the, researcher, personal, opinion, is, always, prone, to, bias, which, reduces, the, validity, of, any, data, obtained, therefore, maslow, s, operational, definition, of, self, actualization, must, not, be, uncritically, accepted, as, quantitative, fact, during, the, 1960s, maslow, founded, with, stanislav, grof, viktor, frankl, james, fadiman, anthony, sutich, miles, vich, and, michael, murphy, the, school, of, transpersonal, psychology, maslow, had, concluded, that, humanistic, psychology, was, incapable, of, explaining, all, aspects, of, human, experience, he, identified, various, mystical, ecstatic, or, spiritual, states, known, as, peak, experiences, as, experiences, beyond, self, actualization, maslow, called, these, experiences, a, fourth, force, in, psychology, which, he, named, transpersonal, psychology, transpersonal, psychology, was, concerned, with, the, empirical, scientific, study, of, and, responsible, implementation, of, the, finding, relevant, to, becoming, mystical, ecstatic, and, spiritual, states, olson, hergenhahn, 2011, in, 1962, maslow, published, a, collection, of, papers, on, this, theme, which, developed, into, his, 1968, book, toward, a, psychology, of, being, in, this, book, maslow, stresses, the, importance, of, transpersonal, psychology, to, human, beings, writing, without, the, transpersonal, we, get, sick, violent, and, nihilistic, or, else, hopeless, and, apathetic, olson, hergenhahn, 2011, human, beings, he, came, to, believe, need, something, bigger, than, themselves, that, they, are, connected, to, in, a, naturalistic, sense, but, not, in, a, religious, sense, maslow, himself, was, an, atheist, and, found, it, difficult, to, accept, religious, experience, as, valid, unless, placed, in, a, positivistic, framework, in, fact, maslow, s, position, on, god, and, religion, was, quite, complex, while, he, rejected, organized, religion, and, its, beliefs, he, wrote, extensively, on, the, human, being, s, need, for, the, sacred, and, spoke, of, god, in, more, philosophical, terms, as, beauty, truth, and, goodness, or, as, a, force, or, a, principle, awareness, of, transpersonal, psychology, became, widespread, within, psychology, and, the, journal, of, transpersonal, psychology, was, founded, in, 1969, a, year, after, abraham, maslow, became, the, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, the, united, states, transpersonal, psychology, encouraged, recognition, for, non, western, psychologies, philosophies, and, religions, and, promoted, understanding, of, higher, states, of, consciousness, for, instance, through, intense, meditation, transpersonal, psychology, has, been, applied, in, many, areas, including, transpersonal, business, studies, maslow, called, his, work, positive, psychology, since, 1968, his, work, has, influenced, the, development, of, positive, psychotherapy, a, transcultural, humanistic, based, psychodynamic, psychotherapy, method, used, in, mental, health, and, psychosomatic, treatment, founded, by, nossrat, peseschkian, since, 1999, maslow, s, work, enjoyed, a, revival, of, interest, and, influence, among, leaders, of, the, positive, psychology, movement, such, as, martin, seligman, this, movement, focuses, only, on, a, higher, human, nature, positive, psychology, spends, its, research, looking, at, the, positive, side, of, things, and, how, they, go, right, rather, than, the, pessimistic, side, in, 1966, maslow, published, a, pioneering, work, in, the, psychology, of, science, the, psychology, of, science, a, reconnaissance, the, first, book, ever, actually, titled, psychology, of, science, in, this, book, maslow, proposed, a, model, of, characterologically, relative, science, which, he, characterized, as, an, ardent, opposition, to, the, historically, philosophically, sociologically, and, psychologically, na, ve, positivistic, reluctance, to, see, science, relative, to, time, place, and, local, culture, maslow, acknowledged, that, the, book, was, greatly, inspired, by, thomas, kuhn, s, the, structure, of, scientific, revolutions, 1962, and, it, offers, a, psychological, reading, of, kuhn, s, famous, distinction, between, normal, and, revolutionary, science, in, the, context, of, his, own, distinction, between, safety, and, growth, science, put, forward, as, part, of, a, larger, program, for, the, psychology, of, science, outlined, already, in, his, 1954, magnum, opus, motivation, and, personality, not, only, that, maslow, offered, a, psychological, reading, of, kuhn, s, categories, of, normal, and, revolutionary, science, as, an, aftermath, of, kuhn, s, structure, but, he, also, offered, a, strikingly, similar, dichotomous, structure, of, science, 16, years, before, the, first, edition, of, structure, in, his, nowadays, little, known, 1946, paper, means, centering, versus, problem, centering, in, science, published, in, the, journal, philosophy, of, science, abraham, maslow, is, also, known, for, maslow, s, hammer, popularly, phrased, as, if, all, you, have, is, a, hammer, everything, looks, like, a, nail, from, his, book, the, psychology, of, science, published, in, 1966, maslow, s, ideas, have, been, criticized, for, their, lack, of, scientific, rigor, he, was, criticized, as, too, soft, scientifically, by, american, empiricists, in, 2006, author, and, former, philosophy, professor, christina, hoff, sommers, and, practicing, psychiatrist, sally, satel, asserted, that, due, to, lack, of, empirical, support, maslow, s, ideas, have, fallen, out, of, fashion, and, are, no, longer, taken, seriously, in, the, world, of, academic, psychology, positive, psychology, spends, much, of, its, research, looking, for, how, things, go, right, rather, than, the, more, pessimistic, view, point, how, things, go, wrong, the, hierarchy, of, needs, has, furthermore, been, accused, of, having, a, cultural, bias, mainly, reflecting, western, values, and, ideologies, from, the, perspective, of, many, cultural, psychologists, this, concept, is, considered, relative, to, each, culture, and, society, and, cannot, be, universally, applied, however, according, to, the, university, of, illinois, researchers, ed, diener, and, louis, tay, who, put, maslow, s, ideas, to, the, test, with, data, collected, from, 60, 865, participants, in, 123, countries, around, the, world, over, the, period, of, five, years, 2005, 2010, maslow, was, essentially, right, in, that, there, are, universal, human, needs, regardless, of, cultural, differences, although, the, authors, claim, to, have, found, certain, departures, from, the, order, of, their, fulfillment, maslow, described, in, particular, while, they, found, clearly, in, accordance, with, maslow, that, people, tend, to, achieve, basic, and, safety, needs, before, other, needs, as, well, as, that, other, higher, needs, tend, to, be, fulfilled, in, a, certain, order, the, order, in, which, they, are, fulfilled, apparently, does, not, strongly, influence, their, subjective, well, being, swb, as, put, by, the, authors, of, the, study, humans, thus, can, derive, happiness, from, simultaneously, working, on, a, number, of, needs, regardless, of, the, fulfillment, of, other, needs, this, might, be, why, people, in, impoverished, nations, with, only, modest, control, over, whether, their, basic, needs, are, fulfilled, can, nevertheless, find, a, measure, of, well, being, through, social, relationships, and, other, psychological, needs, over, which, they, have, more, control, maslow, however, would, probably, not, be, surprised, by, these, findings, since, he, clearly, and, repeatedly, emphasized, that, the, need, hierarchy, is, not, a, rigid, fixed, order, as, it, is, often, presented, we, have, spoken, so, far, as, if, this, hierarchy, were, a, fixed, order, but, actually, it, is, not, nearly, so, rigid, as, we, may, have, implied, it, is, true, that, most, of, the, people, with, whom, we, have, worked, have, seemed, to, have, these, basic, needs, in, about, the, order, that, has, been, indicated, however, there, have, been, a, number, of, exceptions, maslow, also, regarded, that, the, relationship, between, different, human, needs, and, behavior, being, in, fact, often, motivated, simultaneously, by, multiple, needs, is, not, a, one, to, one, correspondence, i, e, that, these, needs, must, be, understood, not, to, be, exclusive, or, single, determiners, of, certain, kinds, of, behavior, maslow, s, concept, of, self, actualizing, people, was, united, with, piaget, s, developmental, theory, to, the, process, of, initiation, in, 1993, maslow, s, theory, of, self, actualization, has, been, met, with, significant, resistance, the, theory, itself, is, crucial, to, the, humanistic, branch, of, psychology, and, yet, it, is, widely, misunderstood, the, concept, behind, self, actualization, is, widely, misunderstood, and, subject, to, frequent, scrutiny, maslow, was, criticized, for, noting, too, many, exceptions, to, his, theory, as, he, acknowledged, these, exceptions, he, did, not, do, much, to, account, for, them, shortly, prior, to, his, death, one, problem, he, tried, to, resolve, was, that, there, are, people, who, have, satisfied, their, deficiency, needs, but, still, do, not, become, self, actualized, he, never, resolved, this, inconsistency, within, his, theory, social, psychologist, david, myers, has, pointed, out, maslow, s, selection, bias, rooted, in, the, choice, to, study, individuals, who, lived, out, his, own, values, if, he, had, studied, other, historical, heroes, such, as, napoleon, alexander, the, great, and, john, d, rockefeller, his, descriptions, of, self, actualization, might, have, been, significantly, different, later, in, life, maslow, was, concerned, with, questions, such, as, why, don, t, more, people, self, actualize, if, their, basic, needs, are, met, how, can, we, humanistically, understand, the, problem, of, evil, in, the, spring, of, 1961, maslow, and, tony, sutich, founded, the, journal, of, humanistic, psychology, with, miles, vich, as, editor, until, 1971, the, journal, printed, its, first, issue, in, early, 1961, and, continues, to, publish, academic, papers, maslow, attended, the, association, for, humanistic, psychology, s, founding, meeting, in, 1963, where, he, declined, nomination, as, its, president, arguing, that, the, new, organization, should, develop, an, intellectual, movement, without, a, leader, which, resulted, in, useful, strategy, during, the, field, s, early, years, in, 1967, maslow, was, named, humanist, of, the, year, by, the, american, humanist, association
