concept, of, the, tao, te, ching, the, concept, of, wu, wei, is, multifaceted, and, reflected, in, the, words, multiple, meanings, even, in, english, translation, it, can, mean, not, doing, anything, not, forcing, not, acting, in, the, theatrical, sense, creating, nothingness, acting, spontaneously, and, flowing, with, the, moment, this, concept, is, used, to, explain, ziran, or, harmony, with, the, tao, it, includes, the, concepts, that, value, distinctions, are, ideological, and, seeing, ambition, of, all, sorts, as, originating, from, the, same, source, tao, te, ching, used, the, term, broadly, with, simplicity, and, humility, as, key, virtues, often, in, contrast, to, selfish, action, on, a, political, level, it, means, avoiding, such, circumstances, as, war, harsh, laws, and, heavy, taxes, some, taoists, see, a, connection, between, wu, wei, and, esoteric, practices, such, as, zuowang, sitting, in, oblivion, emptying, the, mind, of, bodily, awareness, and, thought, found, in, the, zhuangzi, alan, chan, provides, an, example, of, how, laozi, encouraged, a, change, in, approach, or, return, to, nature, rather, than, action, technology, may, bring, about, a, false, sense, of, progress, the, answer, provided, by, laozi, is, not, the, rejection, of, technology, but, instead, seeking, the, calm, state, of, wu, wei, free, from, desires, this, relates, to, many, statements, by, laozi, encouraging, rulers, to, keep, their, people, in, ignorance, or, simple, minded, some, scholars, insist, this, explanation, ignores, the, religious, context, and, others, question, it, as, an, apologetic, of, the, philosophical, coherence, of, the, text, it, would, not, be, unusual, political, advice, if, laozi, literally, intended, to, tell, rulers, to, keep, their, people, ignorant, however, some, terms, in, the, text, such, as, valley, spirit, g, sh, n, and, soul, p, bear, a, metaphysical, context, and, cannot, be, easily, reconciled, with, a, purely, ethical, reading, of, the,
