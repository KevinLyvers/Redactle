decided, to, seek, out, heinrich, neuhaus, a, pianist, and, piano, teacher, at, the, moscow, conservatory, during, richter, s, audition, for, neuhaus, at, which, he, performed, chopin, s, ballade, no, 4, neuhaus, apparently, whispered, to, a, fellow, student, this, man, s, a, genius, although, neuhaus, taught, many, pianists, including, emil, gilels, and, radu, lupu, it, is, said, that, he, considered, richter, to, be, the, genius, pupil, for, whom, he, had, been, waiting, all, his, life, while, acknowledging, that, he, taught, richter, almost, nothing, early, in, his, career, richter, also, tried, composition, and, it, even, appears, that, he, played, some, of, his, works, during, his, audition, for, neuhaus, he, gave, up, composition, shortly, after, moving, to, moscow, years, later, richter, explained, this, decision, as, follows, perhaps, the, best, way, i, can, put, it, is, that, i, see, no, point, in, adding, to, all, the, bad, music, in, the, world, by, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, richter, s, parents, marriage, had, failed, and, his, mother, had, fallen, in, love, with, another, man, because, richter, s, father, was, a, german, he, was, under, suspicion, by, the, authorities, and, a, plan, was, made, for, the, family, to, flee, the, country, due, to, her, romantic, involvement, his, mother, did, not, want, to, leave, and, so, they, remained, in, odessa,

during, the, memorial, service, for, vladimir, nemirovich, danchenko, caught, up, with, her, at, the, street, and, suggested, to, accompany, her, in, recital, it, is, often, alleged, that, they, married, around, this, time, but, in, fact, dorliak, only, obtained, a, marriage, certificate, a, few, months, after, richter, s, death, in, 1997, they, remained, living, companions, from, around, 1945, until, richter, s, death, they, had, no, children, dorliak, accompanied, richter, both, in, his, complex, private, life, and, career, she, supported, him, in, his, final, illness, and, died, herself, less, than, a, year, later, on, may, 17, 1998, since, his, death, it, has, been, reported, that, richter, was, homosexual, and, that, having, a, female, companion, provided, a, social, front, for, his, true, sexual, orientation, because, homosexuality, was, widely, taboo, at, that, time, and, could, result, in, legal, repercussions, richter, was, an, intensely, private, person, and, was, usually, quiet, and, withdrawn, and, refused, to, give, interviews, he, never, publicly, discussed, his, personal, life, until, the, last, year, of, his, life, when, filmmaker, bruno, monsaingeon,

of, rachmaninoff, s, 2nd, piano, concerto, with, the, warsaw, philharmonic, on, deutsche, grammophon, label, thus, the, west, first, became, aware, of, richter, through, recordings, made, in, the, 1950s, one, of, richter, s, first, advocates, in, the, west, was, emil, gilels, who, stated, during, his, first, tour, of, the, united, states, that, the, critics, who, were, giving, gilels, rave, reviews, should, wait, until, you, hear, richter, richter, s, first, concerts, in, the, west, took, place, in, may, 1960, when, he, was, allowed, to, play, in, finland, and, on, october, 15, 1960, in,

claudia, cassidy, who, was, known, for, her, unkind, reviews, of, established, artists, recalled, richter, first, walking, on, stage, hesitantly, looking, vulnerable, as, if, about, to, be, devoured, but, then, sitting, at, the, piano, and, dispatching, the, performance, of, a, lifetime, richter, s, 1960, tour, of, the, united, states, culminated, in, a, series, of, concerts, at, carnegie, hall, richter, disliked, performing, in, the, united, states, following, a, 1970, incident, at, carnegie, hall, in, new, york, city, when, richter, s, performance, alongside, david, oistrakh, was, disrupted, by, anti, soviet, protests, richter, vowed, never, to, return, rumors, of, a, planned, return, to, carnegie, hall, surfaced, in, the, last, years, of, richter, s, life, although, it, is, not, clear, whether, there, was, any, truth, behind, them, in, 1961, richter, played, for, the, first, time, in, london, his, first, recital, pairing, works, of, haydn, and, prokofiev, was, received, with, hostility, by, british, critics, neville, cardus, concluded, that, richter, s, playing, was, provincial, and, wondered, why, richter, had, been, invited, to, play, in, london, given, that, london, had, plenty, of, second, class, pianists, of, its, own, following, a, july, 18, 1961, concert, where, richter, performed, both, of, liszt, s, piano, concertos, the, critics, reversed, course, in, 1963, after, searching, in, the, loire, valley, france, for, a, venue, suitable, for, a, music, festival, richter, discovered, la, grange, de, meslay, several, kilometres, north, of, tours, the, festival, was, established, by, richter, and, became, an, annual, event, in, 1970, richter, visited, japan, for, the, first, time, traveling, across, siberia, by, railway, and, ship, as, he, disliked, flying, he, played, beethoven, schumann, mussorgsky, prokofiev, bart, k, and, rachmaninoff, as, well, as, works, by, mozart, and, beethoven, with, japanese, orchestras, he, visited, japan, eight, times, while, he, very, much, enjoyed, performing, for, an, audience, richter, hated, planning, concerts, years, in, advance, and, in, later, life, took, to, playing, at, very, short, notice, in, small, most, often, darkened, halls, with, only, a, small, lamp, lighting, the, score, richter, said, that, this, setting, helped, the, audience, focus, on, the, music, being, performed, rather, than, on, extraneous, and, irrelevant, matters, such, as, the, performer, s, grimaces, and, gestures, richter, died, at, central, clinical, hospital, in, moscow, from, a, heart, attack, on, august, 1, 1997, aged, 82, he, had, been, suffering, from, depression, due, to, an, inability, to, perform, caused, by, changes, in, his, hearing, that, altered, his, perception, of, pitch, in, 1981, richter, initiated, the, international, december, nights, music, festival, held, at, the, pushkin, museum, which, after, his, death, in, 1997, was, renamed, december, nights, of, sviatoslav, richter, in, 1986, richter, embarked, on, a, six, month, tour, of, siberia, with, his, beloved, yamaha, piano, giving, perhaps, 150, recitals, at, times, performing, in, small, towns, that, did, not, even, have, a, concert, hall, it, is, said, that, after, one, such, concert, the, members, of, the, audience, who, had, never, before, heard, classical, music, performed, gathered, in, the, middle, of, the, hall, and, started, swaying, from, side, to, side, to, celebrate, the, performer, in, his, last, years, richter, gave, a, few, concerts, for, students, that, were, free, of, charge, february, 14, 1990, teatro, romea, murcia, spain, also, march, 1, 1990, matinee, concert, in, teatre, municipal, girona, spain, an, anecdote, illustrates, richter, s, approach, to, performance, in, the, last, decade, of, his, life, after, reading, a, biography, of, charlemagne, he, was, an, avid, reader, richter, had, his, secretary, send, a, telegram, to, the, director, of, the, theater, in, aachen, charlemagne, s, favoured, residence, city, and, his, burial, place, stating, the, maestro, has, read, a, biography, of, charlemagne, and, would, like, to, play, at, aquisgrana, aachen, the, performance, took, place, shortly, thereafter, as, late, as, 1995, richter, continued, to, perform, some, of, the, most, demanding, pieces, in, the, pianistic, repertoire, including, ravel, s, miroirs, cycle, prokofiev, s, second, sonata, and, chopin, s, tudes, ballade, no, 4, and, schumann, s, toccata, richter, s, last, recorded, orchestral, performance, was, of, three, mozart, concerti, in, 1994, with, the, japan,

consisted, of, two, haydn, sonatas, and, reger, s, variations, and, fugue, on, a, theme, by, beethoven, a, piece, for, two, pianos, which, richter, performed, with, pianist, andreas, lucewicz, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, rehearsing, schubert, s, f, nf, klavierst, cke, d, 459, as, richter, once, put, it, my, repertory, runs, to, around, eighty, different, programs, not, counting, chamber, works, his, repertoire, ranged, from, handel, and, bach, to, tchaikovsky, scriabin, szymanowski, berg, webern, stravinsky, bart, k, hindemith, britten, and, gershwin, richter, worked, tirelessly, to, learn, new, pieces, for, instance, in, the, late, 1980s, he, learned, brahms, s, paganini, and, handel, variations, and, in, the, 1990s, several, of, debussy, s, tudes, and, pieces, by, gershwin, and, works, by, bach, and, mozart, that, he, had, not, previously, included, in, his, programs, central, to, his, repertoire, were, the, works, of, schubert, schumann, beethoven, j, s, bach, chopin, liszt, prokofiev, and, debussy, he, is, said, to, have, learned, and, memorized, the, second, book, of, bach, s, the, well, tempered, clavier, in, one, month, he, gave, the, premiere, of, prokofiev, s, sonata, no, 7, which, he, learned, in, four, days, and, no, 9, which, prokofiev, dedicated, to, richter, apart, from, his, solo, career, he, also, performed, chamber, music, with, partners, such, as, mstislav, rostropovich, rudolf, barshai, david, oistrakh, oleg, kagan, yuri, bashmet, natalia, gutman, zolt, n, kocsis, elisabeth, leonskaja, benjamin, britten, and, members, of, the, borodin, quartet, richter, also, often, accompanied, singers, such, as, dietrich, fischer, dieskau, peter, schreier, galina, pisarenko, and, his, wife, and, long, time, artistic, companion, nina, dorliak, richter, also, conducted, the, premiere, of, prokofiev, s, symphony, concerto, for, cello, and, orchestra, this, was, his, sole, appearance, as, a, conductor, the, soloist, was, rostropovich, to, whom, the, work, was, dedicated, prokofiev, also, wrote, his, 1949, cello, sonata, in, c, for, rostropovich, and, he, and, richter, premiered, it, in, 1950, richter, himself, was, a, passable, cellist, and, rostropovich, was, a, good, pianist, at, one, concert, in, moscow, at, which, he, accompanied, rostropovich, on, the, piano, they, exchanged, instruments, for, part, of, the, program, richter, explained, his, approach, to, performance, as, follows, the, interpreter, is, really, an, executant, carrying, out, the, composer, s, intentions, to, the, letter, he, doesn, t, add, anything, that, isn, t, already, in, the, work, if, he, is, talented, he, allows, us, to, glimpse, the, truth, of, the, work, that, is, in, itself, a, thing, of, genius, and, that, is, reflected, in, him, he, shouldn, t, dominate, the, music, but, should, dissolve, into, it, or, similarly, i, am, not, a, complete, idiot, but, whether, from, weakness, or, laziness, have, no, talent, for, thinking, i, know, only, how, to, reflect, i, am, a, mirror, logic, does, not, exist, for, me, i, float, on, the, waves, of, art, and, life, and, never, really, know, how, to, distinguish, what, belongs, to, the, one, or, the, other, or, what, is, common, to, both, life, unfolds, for, me, like, a, theatre, presenting, a, sequence, of, somewhat, unreal, sentiments, while, the, things, of, art, are, real, to, me, and, go, straight, to, my, heart, richter, s, belief, that, musicians, should, carry, out, the, composer, s, intentions, to, the, letter, led, him, to, be, critical, of, others, and, most, often, himself, after, attending, a, recital, of, murray, perahia, where, perahia, performed, chopin, s, third, piano, sonata, without, observing, the, first, movement, repeat, richter, asked, him, backstage, to, explain, the, omission, similarly, after, richter, realized, that, he, had, been, playing, a, wrong, note, in, bach, s, italian, concerto, for, decades, he, insisted, that, the, following, disclaimer, apology, be, printed, on, a, cd, containing, a, performance, thereof, just, now, sviatoslav, richter, realized, much, to, his, regret, that, he, always, made, a, mistake, in, the, third, measure, before, the, end, of, the, second, part, of, the, italian, concerto, as, a, matter, of, fact, through, forty, years, and, no, musician, or, technician, ever, pointed, it, out, to, him, he, played, f, sharp, rather, than, f, the, same, mistake, can, be, found, in, the, previous, recording, made, by, maestro, richter, in, the, fifties, despite, his, large, discography, richter, disliked, making, studio, recordings, and, most, of, his, recordings, originate, from, live, performances, thus, his, live, recitals, from, moscow, 1948, warsaw, 1954, and, 1972, sofia, 1958, new, york, city, 1960, leipzig, 1963, aldeburgh, multiple, years, la, grange, de, meslay, near, tours, multiple, years, prague, multiple, years, salzburg, 1977, and, amsterdam, 1986, are, considered, among, the, finest, documents, of, his, playing, as, are, other, live, recordings, issued, during, his, lifetime, and, since, his, death, on, labels, including, music, arts, bbc, legends, philips, russia, revelation, parnassus, and, ankh, productions, other, critically, acclaimed, live, recordings, by, richter, include, performances, of, scriabin, s, selected, tudes, preludes, and, sonatas, multiple, performances, schumann, s, c, major, fantasy, multiple, performances, beethoven, s, appassionata, sonata, moscow, 1960, schubert, s, b, flat, sonata, multiple, performances, mussorgsky, s,

1975, and, selected, preludes, by, rachmaninoff, multiple, performances, and, debussy, multiple, performances, despite, his, professed, aversion, for, the, studio, richter, took, the, recording, process, seriously, for, instance, after, a, long, recording, session, for, schubert, s, wanderer, fantasy, for, which, he, had, used, a, b, sendorfer, piano, richter, listened, to, the, tapes, and, dissatisfied, with, his, performance, told, the, recording, engineer, well, i, think, we, ll, remake, it, on, the, steinway, after, all, similarly, during, a, recording, session, for, schumann, s, toccata, richter, reportedly, chose, to, play, this, piece, which, schumann, himself, considered, among, the, most, difficult, pieces, ever, written, several, times, in, a, row, without, taking, any, breaks, in, order, to, preserve, the, spontaneity, of, his, interpretation, according, to, falk, schwartz, and, john, berrie, s, 1983, article, sviatoslav, richter, a, discography, in, the, 1970s, richter, announced, his, intention, of, recording, his, complete, solo, repertoire, on, some, 50, discs, this, complete, richter, project, did, not, come, to, fruition, however, although, twelve, lps, worth, of, recordings, were, made, between, 1970, and, 1973, and, were, subsequently, reissued, in, cd, format, by, olympia, various, composers, 10, cds, and, rca, victor, bach, s, the, well, tempered, clavier, in, 1961, richter, s, rca, victor, recording, with, erich, leinsdorf, and, the, chicago, symphony, orchestra, of, the, brahms, piano, concerto, no, 2, won, the, grammy, award, for, best, classical, performance, concerto, or, instrumental, soloist, that, recording, is, still, considered, a, landmark, despite, richter, s, dissatisfaction, with, it, as, are, his, studio, recordings, of, schubert, s, wanderer, fantasy, liszt, s, two, piano, concertos, rachmaninoff, s, second, piano, concerto, and, schumann, s, toccata, among, many, others, richter, appeared, in, a, 1952, soviet, film, playing, liszt, in, kompozitor, glinka, the, composer, glinka, russian, the, italian, critic, piero, rattalino, has, asserted, that, the, only, pianists, comparable, to, richter, in, the, history, of, piano, performance, were, franz, liszt, and, ferruccio, busoni, glenn, gould, called, richter, one, of, the, most, powerful, communicators, the, world, of, music, has, produced, in, our, time, nathan, milstein, described, richter, in, his, memoir, from, russia, to, the, west, as, the, following, richter, was, certainly, a, marvelous, pianist, but, not, as, impeccable, as, he, was, reputed, to, be, his, music, making, was, too, dry, for, me, in, richter, s, interpretation, of, ravel, s, jeux, d, eau, instead, of, flowing, water, you, hear, frozen, icicles, van, cliburn, attended, a, richter, recital, in, 1958, in, the, soviet, union, he, reportedly, wept, during, the, recital, and, upon, returning, to, the, united, states, described, richter, s, playing, as, the, most, powerful, piano, playing, i, have, ever, heard, arthur, rubinstein, described, his, first, exposure, to, richter, as, follows, it, really, wasn, t, anything, out, of, the, ordinary, then, at, some, point, i, noticed, my, eyes, growing, moist, tears, began, rolling, down, my, cheeks, heinrich, neuhaus, described, richter, as, follows, his, singular, ability, to, grasp, the, whole, and, at, the, same, time, miss, none, of, the, smallest, details, of, a, composition, suggests, a, comparison, with, an, eagle, who, from, his, great, height, can, see, as, far, as, the, horizon, and, yet, single, out, the, tiniest, detail, of, the, landscape, dmitri, shostakovich, wrote, of, richter, richter, is, an, extraordinary, phenomenon, the, enormity, of, his, talent, staggers, and, enraptures, all, the, phenomena, of, musical, art, are, accessible, to, him, vladimir, sofronitsky, proclaimed, that, richter, was, a, genius, prompting, richter, to, respond, that, sofronitsky, was, a, god, vladimir, horowitz, said, of, the, russian, pianists, i, like, only, one, richter, pierre, boulez, wrote, of, richter, his, personality, was, greater, than, the, possibilities, offered, to, him, by, the, piano, broader, than, the, very, concept, of, complete, mastery, of, the, instrument, marlene, dietrich, who, was, richter, s, friend, wrote, in, her, autobiography, marlene, one, evening, the, audience, sat, around, him, on, the, stage, while, he, was, playing, a, piece, a, woman, directly, behind, him, collapsed, and, died, on, the, spot, she, was, carried, out, of, the, hall, i, was, deeply, impressed, by, this, incident, and, thought, to, myself, what, an, enviable, fate, to, die, while, richter, is, playing, what, a, strong, feeling, for, the, music, this, woman, must, have, had, when, she, breathed, out, her, life, but, richter, did, not, share, this, opinion, he, was, shaken, gramophone, critic, bryce, morrison, described, richter, as, follows, idiosyncratic, plain,
