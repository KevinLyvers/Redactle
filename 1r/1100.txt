shimin, the, special, title, of, grand, general, of, heavenly, strategies, ti, nc, sh, ngji, ng, meanwhile, li, shimin, s, staff, already, full, of, generals, and, strategists, were, supplemented, with, a, number, of, literary, men, the, former, xia, territory, did, not, remain, in, tang, hands, for, long, in, the, winter, of, 621, the, xia, general, liu, heita, rose, against, tang, rule, claiming, to, be, avenging, dou, whom, emperor, gaozu, had, executed, against, li, shimin, s, wishes, after, he, had, been, brought, back, to, chang, an, liu, was, allied, with, xu, yuanlang, a, former, agrarian, rebel, general, who, was, nominally, under, wang, shichong, and, who, had, submitted, to, tang, after, wang, s, defeat, liu, dealt, successive, defeats, to, emperor, gaozu, s, cousin, li, shentong, the, prince, of, huai, an, li, xiaochang, the, prince, of, yi, an, and, li, shiji, by, the, end, he, had, recovered, almost, all, of, the, former, xia, territory, established, his, capital, at, mingzhou, and, proclaimed, himself, the, prince, of, handong, emperor, gaozu, finally, sent, li, shimin, and, li, yuanji, against, him, in, 622, and, after, some, indecisive, battles, li, shimin, defeated, him, by, first, erecting, a, dam, across, the, ming, river, and, then, destroying, it, with, the, resultant, flood, destroying, the, rebel, army, liu, fled, to, the, eastern, turks, while, li, shimin, then, headed, east, and, defeated, xu, after, leaving, li, shiji, li, shentong, and, ren, gui, to, continue, attacking, xu, li, shimin, returned, to, chang, an, by, this, point, li, shimin, and, his, older, brother, li, jiancheng, who, was, created, crown, prince, in, 618, reportedly, after, emperor, gaozu, first, offered, the, position, to, li, shimin, due, to, his, contributions, were, locked, in, an, intense, rivalry, as, li, shimin, s, accomplishments, caused, people, to, speculate, that, he, would, displace, li, jiancheng, as, crown, prince, and, li, jiancheng, while, an, accomplished, general, himself, was, overshadowed, by, his, younger, brother, the, court, became, divided, into, a, faction, favoring, the, crown, prince, and, a, faction, favoring, the, prince, of, qin, the, rivalry, was, particularly, causing, problems, within, the, capital, as, the, commands, of, the, crown, prince, the, prince, of, qin, and, the, prince, of, qi, li, yuanji, were, said, to, have, the, same, force, as, the, emperor, s, edicts, and, the, officials, had, to, carry, conflicting, orders, out, by, acting, on, the, ones, that, arrived, first, li, shimin, s, staff, was, full, of, talented, men, but, li, jiancheng, was, supported, by, li, yuanji, as, well, as, emperor, gaozu, s, concubines, who, had, better, relationships, with, li, jiancheng, and, li, yuanji, than, they, did, with, li, shimin, late, in, 622, when, liu, heita, returned, east, after, receiving, aid, from, the, eastern, turks, defeating, and, killing, li, shimin, s, cousin, li, daoxuan, the, prince, of, huaiyang, he, again, regained, most, of, former, xia, territory, li, jiancheng, s, staff, members, wang, gui, and, wei, zheng, suggested, that, li, jiancheng, needed, to, enhance, his, own, reputation, in, battle, and, so, li, jiancheng, volunteered, for, the, mission, emperor, gaozu, thus, sent, li, jiancheng, assisted, by, li, yuanji, to, attack, liu, li, jiancheng, defeated, liu, around, the, new, year, of, 623, and, liu, was, subsequently, betrayed, by, his, own, official, zhuge, dewei, and, delivered, to, li, jiancheng, li, jiancheng, executed, liu, in, his, former, capital, and, returned, to, chang, an, in, triumph, china, was, by, this, point, roughly, united, under, tang, rule, for, the, next, few, years, the, rivalry, intensified, although, during, the, meantime, both, li, jiancheng, and, li, shimin, served, as, generals, when, the, eastern, g, kt, rks, made, incursions, in, 623, when, the, general, fu, gongshi, rebelled, at, danyang, in, modern, nanjing, jiangsu, emperor, gaozu, briefly, commissioned, li, shimin, to, attack, fu, but, soon, cancelled, the, order, and, sent, li, shimin, s, cousin, li, xiaogong, the, prince, of, zhao, commandery, instead, in, 624, when, li, jiancheng, was, found, to, have, against, regulations, tried, to, add, soldiers, to, his, guard, corps, emperor, gaozu, was, so, angry, that, he, put, li, jiancheng, under, arrest, in, fear, li, jiancheng, s, guard, commander, yang, wen, gan, rebelled, emperor, gaozu, sent, li, shimin, against, yang, offering, to, make, him, crown, prince, after, he, returned, after, li, shimin, left, however, feng, deyi, now, a, chancellor, li, yuanji, and, the, concubines, all, spoke, on, li, jiancheng, s, behalf, and, after, li, shimin, returned, emperor, gaozu, did, not, depose, li, jiancheng, but, instead, blamed, the, discord, between, him, and, li, shimin, on, li, jiancheng, s, staff, members, wang, gui, and, wei, ting, and, li, shimin, s, staff, member, du, yan, exiling, them, to, xi, prefecture, roughly, modern, liangshan, yi, autonomous, prefecture, sichuan, later, that, year, emperor, gaozu, troubled, by, repeated, g, kt, rk, incursions, seriously, considered, burning, chang, an, to, the, ground, and, moving, the, capital, to, fancheng, a, suggestion, that, li, jiancheng, li, yuanji, and, pei, ji, agreed, with, li, shimin, opposed, however, and, the, plan, was, not, carried, out, meanwhile, li, shimin, himself, was, sending, his, confidants, to, luoyang, to, build, up, personal, control, of, the, army, there, after, an, incident, in, which, li, shimin, suffered, a, severe, case, of, food, poisoning, after, feasting, at, li, jiancheng, s, palace, an, event, that, both, emperor, gaozu, and, li, shimin, apparently, interpreted, as, an, assassination, attempt, emperor, gaozu, considered, sending, li, shimin, to, guard, luoyang, to, prevent, further, conflict, but, li, jiancheng, and, li, yuanji, after, consulting, each, other, believed, that, this, would, only, give, li, shimin, an, opportunity, to, build, up, his, personal, power, there, and, therefore, opposed, it, emperor, gaozu, therefore, did, not, carry, out, the, plan, meanwhile, the, rivalry, continued, traditional, historical, accounts, also, indicated, that, at, one, point, when, li, shimin, visited, li, yuanji, s, mansion, li, yuanji,
