them, favourably, with, their, celtic, revival, contemporaries, and, invoking, ezra, pound, t, s, eliot, and, the, french, symbolists, as, their, precursors, in, describing, these, poets, as, forming, the, nucleus, of, a, living, poetic, in, ireland, beckett, was, tracing, the, outlines, of, an, irish, poetic, modernist, canon, in, 1935, the, year, that, he, successfully, published, a, book, of,

write, of, his, postponed, film, production, in, 1936, a, friend, had, suggested, he, look, up, the, works, of, arnold, geulincx, which, beckett, did, and, he, took, many, notes, the, philosopher, s, name, is, mentioned, in, murphy, and, the, reading, apparently, left, a, strong, impression, murphy, was, finished, in, 1936, and, beckett, departed, for, extensive, travel, around, germany, during, which, time, he, filled, several, notebooks, with, lists, of, noteworthy, artwork, that, he, had, seen, and, noted, his, distaste, for, the, nazi, savagery, that, was, overtaking, the, country,

contributed, to, his, decision, to, settle, permanently, in, paris, beckett, remained, in, paris, following, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, in, 1939, preferring, in, his, own, words, france, at, war, to, ireland, at, peace, his, was, soon, a, known, face, in, and, around, left, bank, caf, s, where, he, strengthened, his, allegiance, with, joyce, and, forged, new, ones, with, artists, alberto, giacometti, and, marcel, duchamp, with, whom, he, regularly, played, chess, sometime, around, december, 1937, beckett, had, a, brief, affair, with, peggy, guggenheim, who, nicknamed, him, oblomov, after, the, character, in, ivan, goncharov, s, novel, in, january, 1938, in, paris, beckett, was, stabbed, in, the, chest, and, nearly, killed, when, he, refused, the, solicitations, of, a, notorious, pimp, who, went, by, the, name, of, prudent, joyce, arranged, a, private, room, for, beckett, at, the, hospital, the, publicity, surrounding, the, stabbing, attracted, the, attention, of, suzanne, dechevaux, dumesnil, who, knew, beckett, slightly, from, his, first, stay, in, paris, this, time, however, the, two, would, begin, a, lifelong, companionship, at, a, preliminary, hearing, beckett, asked, his, attacker, for, the, motive, behind, the, stabbing, prudent, replied, je, ne, sais, pas, monsieur, je, m, excuse, beckett, eventually, dropped, the, charges, against, his, attacker, partially, to, avoid, further, formalities, partly, because, he, found, prudent, likeable, and, well, mannered, after, his, own, near, fatal, stabbing, in, 2022, author, salman, rushdie, cited, beckett, s, example, as, a, reason, for, not, interviewing, his, attacker, for, beckett, the, 1930s, was, a, decade, of, artistic, exploration, he, started, to, take, a, serious, interest, in, art, history, frequenting, ireland, s, national, gallery, studying, a, range, of, painters, and, movements, specifically, the, dutch, golden, age, and, even, visiting, private, collections, in, 1933,

september, 1936, he, took, a, deep, dive, into, germany, s, galleries, and, underground, collections, this, lasting, engagement, with, the, visual, arts, seeped, into, his, creative, process, often, shaping, his, literary, output, and, incentivising, him, to, collaborate, with, artists, such, as, joan, mitchell, and, genevi, ve, asse, after, the, nazi, german, occupation, of, france, in, 1940, beckett, joined, the, french, resistance, in, which, he, worked, as, a, courier, on, several, occasions, over, the, next, two, years, he, was, nearly, caught, by, the, gestapo, in, august, 1942, his, unit, was, betrayed, and, he, and, suzanne, fled, south, on, foot, to, the, safety, of, the, small, village, of, roussillon, in, the, vaucluse, d, partement, in, provence, alpes, c, te, d, azur, during, the, two, years, that, beckett, stayed, in, roussillon, he, indirectly, helped, the, maquis, sabotage, the, german, army, in, the, vaucluse, mountains, though, he, rarely, spoke, about, his, wartime, work, in, later, life, he, was, awarded, the, croix, de, guerre, and, the, m, daille, de, la, r, sistance, by, the, french, government, for, his, efforts, in, fighting, the, german, occupation, to, the, end, of, his, life, however, beckett, would, refer, to, his, work, with, the, french, resistance, as, boy, scout, stuff, while, in, hiding, in, roussillon, beckett, continued, work, on, the, novel, watt, he, started, the, novel, in, 1941, and, completed, it, in, 1945, but, it, was, not, published, until, 1953, however, an, extract, had, appeared, in, the, dublin, literary,

experiences, in, an, untransmitted, radio, script, the, capital, of, the, ruins, in, 1945, beckett, returned, to, dublin, for, a, brief, visit, during, his, stay, he, had, a, revelation, in, his, mother, s, room, his, entire, future, direction, in, literature, appeared, to, him, beckett, had, felt, that, he, would, remain, forever, in, the, shadow, of, joyce, certain, to, never, beat, him, at, his, own, game, his, revelation, prompted, him, to, change, direction, and, acknowledge, both, his, own, stupidity, and, his, interest, in, ignorance, and, impotence, i, realised, that, joyce, had, gone, as, far, as, one, could, in, the, direction, of, knowing, more, in, control, of, one, s, material, he, was, always, adding, to, it, you, only, have, to, look, at, his, proofs, to, see, that, i, realised, that, my, own, way, was, in, impoverishment, in, lack, of, knowledge, and, in, taking, away, in, subtracting, rather, than, in, adding, knowlson, argues, that, beckett, was, rejecting, the, joycean, principle, that, knowing, more, was, a, way, of, creatively, understanding, the, world, and, controlling, it, in, future, his, work, would, focus, on, poverty, failure, exile, and, loss, as, he, put, it, on, man, as, a, non, knower, and, as, a, non, can, er, the, revelation, has, rightly, been, regarded, as, a, pivotal, moment, in, his, entire, career, beckett, fictionalised, the, experience, in, his, play, krapp, s, last, tape, 1958, while, listening, to, a, tape, he, made, earlier, in, his, life, krapp, hears, his, younger, self, say, clear, to, me, at, last, that, the, dark, i, have, always, struggled, to, keep, under, is, in, reality, my, most, at, which, point, krapp, fast, forwards, the, tape, before, the, audience, can, hear, the, complete, revelation, beckett, later, explained, to, knowlson, that, the, missing, words, on, the, tape, are, precious, ally, in, 1946, jean, paul, sartre, s, magazine, les, temps, modernes, published, the, first, part, of, beckett, s, short, story, suite, later, to, be, called, la, fin, or, the, end, not, realising, that, beckett, had, only, submitted, the, first, half, of, the, story, co, editor, simone, de, beauvoir, refused, to, publish, the, second, part, beckett, also, began, to, write, his, fourth, novel, mercier, et, camier, which, was, not, published, until, 1970, the, novel, preceded, his, most, famous, work, the, play, en, attendant, godot, waiting, for, godot, which, was, written, not, long, afterwards, more, importantly, mercier, and, camier, was, beckett, s, first, long, work, that, he, wrote, in, french, the, language, of, most, of, his, subsequent, works, which, were, strongly, supported, by, j, r, me, lindon, director, of, his, parisian, publishing, house, les, ditions, de, minuit, including, the, poioumenon, trilogy, of, novels, molloy, 1951, malone, meurt, 1951, malone, dies, 1958, l, innommable, 1953, the, unnamable, 1960, despite, being, a, native, english, speaker, beckett, wrote, in,

beckett, worked, on, the, play, between, october, 1948, and, january, 1949, his, partner, suzanne, dechevaux, dumesnil, was, integral, to, its, success, dechevaux, dumesnil, became, his, agent, and, sent, the, manuscript, to, multiple, producers, until, they, met, roger, blin, the, soon, to, be, director, of, the, play, blin, s, knowledge, of, french, theatre, and, vision, alongside, beckett, s, knowing, what, he, wanted, the, play, to, represent, contributed, greatly, to, its, success, in, a, much, quoted, article, the, critic, vivian, mercier, wrote, that, beckett, has, achieved, a, theoretical, impossibility, a, play, in, which, nothing, happens, that, yet, keeps, audiences, glued, to, their, seats, what, s, more, since, the, second, act, is, a, subtly, different, reprise, of, the, first, he, has, written, a, play, in, which, nothing, happens, twice, the, play, was, published, in, 1952, and, premi, red, in, 1953, in, paris, an, english, translation, was, performed, two, years, later, the, play, was, a, critical, popular, and, controversial, success, in, paris, it, opened, in, london, in, 1955, to, mainly, negative, reviews, but, the, tide, turned, with, positive, reactions, from, harold, hobson, in, the, sunday, times, and, later, kenneth, tynan, after, the, showing, in, miami, the, play, became, extremely, popular, with, highly, successful, performances, in, the, us, and, germany, the, play, is, a, favourite, it, is, not, only, performed, frequently, but, has, globally, inspired, playwrights, to, emulate, it, this, is, the, sole, play, the, manuscript, of, which, beckett, never, sold, donated, or, gave, away, he, refused, to, allow, the, play, to, be, translated, into, film, but, did, allow, it, to, be, played, on, television, during, this, time, in, the, 1950s, beckett, became, one, of, several, adults, who, sometimes, drove, local, children, to, school, one, such, child, was, andr, roussimoff, who, would, later, become, a, famous, professional, wrestler, under, the, name, andr, the, giant, they, had, a, surprising, amount, of, common, ground, and, bonded, over, their, love, of, cricket, with, roussimoff, later, recalling, that, the, two, rarely, talked, about, anything, else, beckett, translated, all, of, his, works, into, english, himself, with, the, exception, of, molloy, for, which, he, collaborated, with, patrick, bowles, the, success, of, waiting, for, godot, opened, up, a, career, in, theatre, for, its, author, beckett, went, on, to, write, successful, full, length, plays, including, fin, de, partie, endgame, 1957, krapp, s, last, tape, 1958, written, in, english, happy, days, 1961, also, written, in, english, and, play, 1963, in, 1961, beckett, received, the, international, publishers, formentor, prize,

1961, he, married, suzanne, in, a, secret, civil, ceremony, in, england, its, secrecy, due, to, reasons, relating, to, french, inheritance, law, the, success, of, his, plays, led, to, invitations, to, attend, rehearsals, and, productions, around, the, world, leading, eventually, to, a, new, career, as, a, theatre, director, in, 1957, he, had, his, first, commission, from, the, bbc, third, programme, for, a, radio, play, all, that, fall, he, continued, writing, sporadically, for, radio, and, extended, his, scope, to, include, cinema, and, television, he, began, to, write, in, english, again, although, he, also, wrote, in, french, until, the, end, of, his, life, he, bought, some, land, in, 1953, near, a, hamlet, about, 60, kilometres, 40, mi, northeast, of, paris, and, built, a, cottage, for, himself, with, the, help, of, some, locals, from, the, late, 1950s, until, his, death, beckett, had, a, relationship, with, barbara, bray, a, widow, who, worked, as, a, script, editor, for, the, bbc, knowlson, wrote, of, them, she, was, small, and, attractive, but, above, all, keenly, intelligent, and, well, read, beckett, seems, to, have, been, immediately, attracted, by, her, and, she, to, him, their, encounter, was, highly, significant, for, them, both, for, it, represented, the, beginning, of, a, relationship, that, was, to, last, in, parallel, with, that, with, suzanne, for, the, rest, of, his, life, bray, died, in, edinburgh, on, 25, february, 2010, in, 1969, the, avant, garde, filmmaker, rosa, von, praunheim, shot, an, experimental, short, film, portrait, about, beckett, which, he, named, after, the, writer, in, october, 1969, while, on, holiday, in, tunis, with, suzanne, beckett, heard, that, he, had, won, the, 1969, nobel, prize, in, literature, anticipating, that, her, intensely, private, husband, would, be, saddled, with, fame, from, that, moment, on, suzanne, called, the, award, a, catastrophe, while, beckett, did, not, devote, much, time, to, interviews, he, sometimes, met, the, artists, scholars, and, admirers, who, sought, him, out, in, the, anonymous, lobby, of, the, hotel, plm, saint, jacques, in, paris, where, he, gave, his, appointments, and, took, frequently, his, lunches, near, his, montparnasse, home, although, beckett, was, an, intensely, private, man, a, review, of, the, second, volume, of, his, letters, by, roy, foster, on, 15, december, 2011, issue, of, the, new, republic, reveals, beckett, to, be, not, only, unexpectedly, amiable, but, frequently, prepared, to, talk, about, his, work, and, the, process, behind, it, suzanne, died, on, 17, july, 1989, confined, to, a, nursing, home, and, suffering, from, emphysema, and, possibly, parkinson, s, disease, beckett, died, on, 22, december, 1989, the, two, were, interred, together, in, the, cimeti, re, du, montparnasse, in, paris, and, share, a, simple, granite, gravestone, that, follows, beckett, s, directive, that, it, should, be, any, colour, so, long, as, it, s, grey, beckett, s, career, as, a, writer, can, be, roughly, divided, into, three, periods, his, early, works, up, until, the, end, of, world, war, ii, in, 1945, his, middle, period, stretching, from, 1945, until, the, early, 1960s, during, which, he, wrote, what, are, probably, his, best, known, works, and, his, late, period, from, the, early, 1960s, until, beckett, s, death, in, 1989, during, which, his, works, tended, to, become, shorter, and, his, style, more, minimalist, beckett, s, earliest, works, are, generally, considered, to, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, the, work, of, his, friend, james, joyce, they, are, erudite, and, seem, to, display, the, author, s, learning, merely, for, its, own, sake, resulting, in, several, obscure, passages, the, opening, phrases, of, the, short, story, collection, more, pricks, than, kicks, 1934, afford, a, representative, sample, of, this, style, it, was, morning, and, belacqua, was, stuck, in, the, first, of, the, canti, in, the, moon, he, was, so, bogged, that, he, could, move, neither, backward, nor, forward, blissful, beatrice, was, there, dante, also, and, she, explained, the, spots, on, the, moon, to, him, she, shewed, him, in, the, first, place, where, he, was, at, fault, then, she, put, up, her, own, explanation, she, had, it, from, god, therefore, he, could, rely, on, its, being, accurate, in, every, particular, the, passage, makes, reference, to, dante, s, commedia, which, can, serve, to, confuse, readers, not, familiar, with, that, work, it, also, anticipates, aspects, of, beckett, s, later, work, the, physical, inactivity, of, the, character, belacqua, the, character, s, immersion, in, his, own, head, and, thoughts, the, somewhat, irreverent, comedy, of, the, final, sentence, similar, elements, are, present, in, beckett, s, first, published, novel, murphy, 1938, which, also, explores, the, themes, of, insanity, and, chess, both, of, which, would, be, recurrent, elements, in, beckett, s, later, works, the, novel, s, opening, sentence, hints, at, the, somewhat, pessimistic, undertones, and, black, humour, that, animate, many, of, beckett, s, works, the, sun, shone, having, no, alternative, on, the, nothing, new, watt, written, while, beckett, was, in, hiding, in, roussillon, during, world, war, ii, is, similar, in, terms, of, themes, but, less, exuberant, in, its, style, it, explores, human, movement, as, if, it, were, a, mathematical, permutation, presaging, beckett, s, later, preoccupation, in, both, his, novels, and, dramatic, works, with, precise, movement, beckett, s, 1930, essay, proust, was, strongly, influenced, by, schopenhauer, s, pessimism, and, laudatory, descriptions, of, saintly, asceticism, at, this, time, beckett, began, to, write, creatively, in, the, french, language, in, the, late, 1930s, he, wrote, a, number, of, short, poems, in, that, language, and, their, sparseness, in, contrast, to, the, density, of, his, english, poems, of, roughly, the, same, period, collected, in, echo, s, bones, and, other, precipitates, 1935, seems, to, show, that, beckett, albeit, through, the, medium, of, another, language, was, in, process, of, simplifying, his, style, a, change, also, evidenced, in, watt, who, may, tell, the, tale, of, the, old, man, weigh, absence, in, a, scale, mete, want, with, a, span, the, sum, assess, of, the, world, s, woes, nothingness, in, words, enclose, from, watt, 1953, after, world, war, ii, beckett, turned, definitively, to, the, french, language, as, a, vehicle, it, was, this, together, with, the, revelation, experienced, in, his, mother, s, room, in, dublin, in, which, he, realised, that, his, art, must, be, subjective, and, drawn, wholly, from, his, own, inner, world, that, would, result, in, the, works, for, which, beckett, is, best, remembered, today, during, the, 15, years, following, the, war, beckett, produced, four, major, full, length, stage, plays, en, attendant, godot, written, 1948, 1949, waiting, for, godot, fin, de, partie, 1955, 1957, endgame, krapp, s, last, tape, 1958, and, happy, days, 1961, these, plays, which, are, often, considered, rightly, or, wrongly, to, have, been, instrumental, in, the, so, called, theatre, of, the, absurd, deal, in, a, darkly, humorous, way, with, themes, similar, to, those, of, the, roughly, contemporary, existentialist, thinkers, the, term, theatre, of, the, absurd, was, coined, by, martin, esslin, in, a, book, of, the, same, name, beckett, and, godot, were, centrepieces, of, the, book, esslin, argued, these, plays, were, the, fulfilment, of, albert, camus, s, concept, of, the, absurd, this, is, one, reason, beckett, is, often, falsely, labelled, as, an, existentialist, this, is, based, on, the, assumption, that, camus, was, an, existentialist, though, he, in, fact, broke, off, from, the, existentialist, movement, and, founded, his, own, philosophy, though, many, of, the, themes, are, similar, beckett, had, little, affinity, for, existentialism, as, a, whole, broadly, speaking, the, plays, deal, with, the, subject, of, despair, and, the, will, to, survive, in, spite, of, that, despair, in, the, face, of, an, uncomprehending, and, incomprehensible, world, the, words, of, nell, one, of, the, two, characters, in, endgame, who, are, trapped, in, ashbins, from, which, they, occasionally, peek, their, heads, to, speak, can, best, summarise, the, themes, of, the, plays, of, beckett, s, middle, period, nothing, is, funnier, than, unhappiness, i, grant, you, that, yes, yes, it, s, the, most, comical, thing, in, the, world, and, we, laugh, we, laugh, with, a, will, in, the, beginning, but, it, s, always, the, same, thing, yes, it, s, like, the, funny, story, we, have, heard, too, often, we, still, find, it, funny, but, we, don, t, laugh, any, more, beckett, s, outstanding, achievements, in, prose, during, the, period, were, the, three, novels, molloy, 1951, malone, meurt, 1951, malone, dies, and, l, innommable, 1953, the, unnamable, in, these, novels, sometimes, referred, to, as, a, trilogy, though, this, is, against, the, author, s, own, explicit, wishes, the, prose, becomes, increasingly, bare, and, stripped, down, molloy, for, instance, still, retains, many, of, the, characteristics, of, a, conventional, novel, time, place, movement, and, plot, and, it, makes, use, of, the, structure, of, a, detective, novel, in, malone, dies, movement, and, plot, are, largely, dispensed, with, though, there, is, still, some, indication, of, place, and, the, passage, of, time, the, action, of, the, book, takes, the, form, of, an, interior, monologue, finally, in, the, unnamable, almost, all, sense, of, place, and, time, are, abolished, and, the, essential, theme, seems, to, be, the, conflict, between, the, voice, s, drive, to, continue, speaking, so, as, to, continue, existing, and, its, almost, equally, strong, urge, towards, silence, and, oblivion, despite, the, widely, held, view, that, beckett, s, work, as, exemplified, by, the, novels, of, this, period, is, essentially, pessimistic, the, will, to, live, seems, to, win, out, in, the, end, witness, for, instance, the, famous, final, phrase, of, the, unnamable, you, must, go, on, i, can, t, go, on, i, ll, go, on, after, these, three, novels, beckett, struggled, for, many, years, to, produce, a, sustained, work, of, prose, a, struggle, evidenced, by, the, brief, stories, later, collected, as, texts, for, nothing, in, the, late, 1950s, however, he, created, one, of, his, most, radical, prose, works, comment, c, est, 1961, how, it, is, an, early, variant, version, of, comment, c, est, l, image, was, published, in, the, british, arts, review, x, a, quarterly, review, 1959, and, is, the, first, appearance, of, the, novel, in, any, form, this, work, relates, the, adventures, of, an, unnamed, narrator, crawling, through, the, mud, while, dragging, a, sack, of, canned, food, it, was, written, as, a, sequence, of, unpunctuated, paragraphs, in, a, style, approaching, telegraphese, you, are, there, somewhere, alive, somewhere, vast, stretch, of, time, then, it, s, over, you, are, there, no, more, alive, no, more, than, again, you, are, there, again, alive, again, it, wasn, t, over, an, error, you, begin, again, all, over, more, or, less, in, the, same, place, or, in, another, as, when, another, image, above, in, the, light, you, come, to, in, hospital, in, the, dark, following, this, work, it, was, almost, another, decade, before, beckett, produced, a, work, of, non, dramatic, prose, how, it, is, is, generally, considered, to, mark, the, end, of, his, middle, period, as, a, writer, time, she, stopped, sitting, at, her, window, quiet, at, her, window, only, window, facing, other, windows, other, only, windows, all, eyes, all, sides, high, and, low, time, she, stopped, from, rockaby, 1980, throughout, the, 1960s, and, into, the, 1970s, beckett, s, works, exhibited, an, increasing, tendency, already, evident, in, much, of, his, work, of, the, 1950s, towards, compactness, this, has, led, to, his, work, sometimes, being, described, as, minimalist, the, extreme, example, of, this, among, his, dramatic, works, is, the, 1969, piece, breath, which, lasts, for, only, 35, seconds, and, has, no, characters, though, it, was, likely, intended, to, offer, ironic, comment, on, oh, calcutta, the, theatrical, revue, for, which, it, served, as, an, introductory, piece, in, his, theatre, of, the, late, period, beckett, s, characters, already, few, in, number, in, the, earlier, plays, are, whittled, down, to, essential, elements, the, ironically, titled, play, 1962, for, instance, consists, of, three, characters, immersed, up, to, their, necks, in, large, funeral, urns, the, television, drama, eh, joe, 1963, which, was, written, for, the, actor, jack, macgowran, is, animated, by, a, camera, that, steadily, closes, into, a, tight, focus, upon, the, face, of, the, title, character, the, play, not, i, 1972, consists, almost, solely, of, in, beckett, s, words, a, moving, mouth, with, the, rest, of, the, stage, in, darkness, following, from, krapp, s, last, tape, many, of, these, later, plays, explore, memory, often, in, the, form, of, a, forced, recollection, of, haunting, past, events, in, a, moment, of, stillness, in, the, present, they, also, deal, with, the, theme, of, the, self, confined, and, observed, with, a, voice, that, either, comes, from, outside, into, the, protagonist, s, head, as, in, eh, joe, or, else, another, character, comments, on, the, protagonist, silently, by, means, of, gesture, as, in, not, i, beckett, s, most, politically, charged, play, catastrophe, 1982, which, was, dedicated, to, v, clav, havel, deals, relatively, explicitly, with, the, idea, of, dictatorship, after, a, long, period, of, inactivity, beckett, s, poetry, experienced, a, revival, during, this, period, in, the, ultra, terse, french, poems, of, mirlitonnades, with, some, as, short, as, six, words, long, these, defied, beckett, s, usual, scrupulous, concern, to, translate, his, work, from, its, original, into, the, other, of, his, two, languages, several, writers, including, derek, mahon, have, attempted, translations, but, no, complete, version, of, the, sequence, has, been, published, in, english, beckett, s, late, style, saw, him, experiment, with, technology, to, create, increasingly, transdisciplinary, works, this, sampling, of, a, range, of, artistic, mediums, and, styles, classical, music, painting, sculpture, television, and, literature, to, create, a, new, and, original, form, or, genre, is, evident, in, his, television, plays, in, works, like, ghost, trio, broadcast, in, 1977, and, nacht, und, tr, ume, broadcast, in, 1983, beckett, uses, a, musical, frame, taking, excerpts, from, beethoven, and, schubert, respectively, to, structure, his, text, and, borrows, well, known, images, from, art, history, to, create, evocative, stills, that, suggest, themes, of, longing, ambiguity, hope, and, suffering, such, experimentation, with, genre, music, and, the, visual, arts, characterises, beckett, s, work, during, the, 1970s, and, 80s, beckett, s, prose, pieces, during, the, late, period, were, not, as, prolific, as, his, theatre, as, suggested, by, the, title, of, the, 1976, collection, of, short, prose, texts, fizzles, which, the, american, artist, jasper, johns, illustrated, beckett, experienced, something, of, a, renaissance, with, the, novella, company, 1980, which, continued, with, ill, seen, ill, said, 1982, and, worstward, ho, 1983, later, collected, in, nohow, on, in, these, three, closed, space, stories, beckett, continued, his, pre, occupation, with, memory, and, its, effect, on, the, confined, and, observed, self, as, well, as, with, the, positioning, of, bodies, in, space, as, the, opening, phrases, of, company, make, clear, a, voice, comes, to, one, in, the, dark, imagine, to, one, on, his, back, in, the, dark, this, he, can, tell, by, the, pressure, on, his, hind, parts, and, by, how, the, dark, changes, when, he, shuts, his, eyes, and, again, when, he, opens, them, again, only, a, small, part, of, what, is, said, can, be, verified, as, for, example, when, he, hears, you, are, on, your, back, in, the, dark, then, he, must, acknowledge, the, truth, of, what, is, said, themes, of, aloneness, and, the, doomed, desire, to, successfully, connect, with, other, human, beings, are, expressed, in, several, late, pieces, including, company, and, rockaby, in, the, hospital, and, nursing, home, where, he, spent, his, final, days, beckett, wrote, his, last, work, the, 1988, poem, what, is, the, word, comment, dire, the, poem, grapples, with, an, inability, to, find, words, to, express, oneself, a, theme, echoing, beckett, s, earlier, work, though, possibly, amplified, by, the, sickness, he, experienced, late, in, life, jack, macgowran, was, the, first, actor, to, perform, a, one, man, show, based, on, the, works, of, beckett, he, debuted, end, of, day, in, dublin, in, 1962, revising, it, as, beginning, to, end, 1965, the, show, went, through, further, revisions, before, beckett, directed, it, in, paris, in, 1970, macgowran, won, the, 1970, 1971, obie, for, best, performance, by, an, actor, when, he, performed, the, show, off, broadway, as, jack, macgowran, in, the, works, of, samuel, beckett, beckett, wrote, the, radio, play, embers, and, the, teleplay, eh, joe, specifically, for, macgowran, the, actor, also, appeared, in, various, productions, of, waiting, for, godot, and, endgame, and, did, several, readings, of, beckett, s, plays, and, poems, on, bbc, radio, he, also, recorded, the, lp, macgowran, speaking, beckett, for, claddagh, records, in, 1966, billie, whitelaw, worked, with, beckett, for, 25, years, on, such, plays, as, not, i, eh, joe, footfalls, and, rockaby, she, first, met, beckett, in, 1963, in, her, autobiography, billie, whitelaw, who, he, she, describes, their, first, meeting, in, 1963, as, trust, at, first, sight, beckett, went, on, to, write, many, of, his, experimental, theatre, works, for, her, she, came, to, be, regarded, as, his, muse, the, supreme, interpreter, of, his, work, perhaps, most, famous, for, her, role, as, the, mouth, in, not, i, she, said, of, the, play, rockaby, i, put, the, tape, in, my, head, and, i, sort, of, look, in, a, particular, way, but, not, at, the, audience, sometimes, as, a, director, beckett, comes, out, with, absolute, gems, and, i, use, them, a, lot, in, other, areas, we, were, doing, happy, days, and, i, just, did, not, know, where, in, the, theatre, to, look, during, this, particular, section, and, i, asked, and, he, thought, for, a, bit, and, then, said, inward, she, said, of, her, role, in, footfalls, i, felt, like, a, moving, musical, edvard, munch, painting, and, in, fact, when, beckett, was, directing, footfalls, he, was, not, only, using, me, to, play, the, notes, but, i, almost, felt, that, he, did, have, the, paintbrush, out, and, was, painting, sam, knew, that, i, would, turn, myself, inside, out, to, give, him, what, he, wanted, she, explained, with, all, of, sam, s, work, the, scream, was, there, my, task, was, to, try, to, get, it, out, she, stopped, performing, his, plays, in, 1989, when, he, died, the, english, stage, designer, jocelyn, herbert, was, a, close, friend, and, influence, on, beckett, until, his, death, she, worked, with, him, on, such, plays, as, happy, days, their, third, project, and, krapp, s, last, tape, at, the, royal, court, theatre, beckett, said, that, herbert, became, his, closest, friend, in, england, she, has, a, great, feeling, for, the, work, and, is, very, sensitive, and, doesn, t, want, to, bang, the, nail, on, the, head, generally, speaking, there, is, a, tendency, on, the, part, of, designers, to, overstate, and, this, has, never, been, the, case, with, jocelyn, the, german, director, walter, d, asmus, began, his, working, relationship, with, beckett, in, the, schiller, theatre, in, berlin, in, 1974, and, continued, until, 1989, the, year, of, the, playwright, s, death, asmus, has, directed, all, of, beckett, s, plays, internationally, of, all, the, english, language, modernists, beckett, s, work, represents, the, most, sustained, attack, on, the, realist, tradition, he, opened, up, the, possibility, of, theatre, and, fiction, that, dispense, with, conventional, plot, and, the, unities, of, time, and, place, to, focus, on, essential, components, of, the, human, condition, v, clav, havel, john, banville, aidan, higgins, tom, stoppard, harold, pinter, and, jon, fosse, have, publicly, stated, their, indebtedness, to, beckett, s, example, he, has, had, a, wider, influence, on, experimental, writing, since, the, 1950s, from, the, beat, generation, to, the, happenings, of, the, 1960s, and, after, in, an, irish, context, he, has, exerted, great, influence, on, poets, such, as, derek, mahon, and, thomas, kinsella, as, well, as, writers, like, trevor, joyce, and, catherine, walsh, who, proclaim, their, adherence, to, the, modernist, tradition, as, an, alternative, to, the, dominant, realist, mainstream, many, major, 20th, century, composers, including, luciano, berio, gy, rgy, kurt, g, morton, feldman, pascal, dusapin, philip, glass, roman, haubenstock, ramati, and, heinz, holliger, have, created, musical, works, based, on, beckett, s, texts, his, work, has, also, influenced, numerous, international, writers, artists, and, filmmakers, including, edward, albee, avigdor, arikha, paul, auster, j, m, coetzee, richard, kalich, douglas, gordon, bruce, nauman, anthony, minghella, damian, pettigrew, charlie, kaufman, and, brian, patrick, butler, beckett, is, one, of, the, most, widely, discussed, and, highly, prized, of, 20th, century, authors, inspiring, a, critical, industry, to, rival, that, which, has, sprung, up, around, james, joyce, he, has, divided, critical, opinion, some, early, philosophical, critics, such, as, sartre, and, theodor, adorno, praised, him, one, for, his, revelation, of, absurdity, the, other, for, his, works, critical, refusal, of, simplicities, others, such, as, georg, luk, cs, condemned, him, for, decadent, lack, of, realism, since, beckett, s, death, all, rights, for, the, performance, of, his, plays, are, handled, by, the, beckett, estate, currently, managed, by, edward, beckett, the, author, s, nephew, the, estate, has, a, controversial, reputation, for, maintaining, firm, control, over, how, beckett, s, plays, are, performed, and, does, not, grant, licences, to, productions, that, do, not, adhere, to, the, writer, s, stage, directions, historians, interested, in, tracing, beckett, s, bloodline, were, in, 2004, granted, access, to, confirmed, trace, samples, of, his, dna, to, conduct, molecular, genealogical, studies, to, facilitate, precise, lineage, determination, some, of, the, best, known, pictures, of, beckett, were, taken, by, photographer, john, minihan, who, photographed, him, between, 1980, and, 1985, and, developed, such, a, good, relationship, with, the, writer, that, he, became, in, effect, his, official, photographer, some, consider, one, of, these, to, be, among, the, top, three, photographs, of, the, 20th, century, it, was, the, theatre, photographer, john, haynes, however, who, took, possibly, the, most, widely, reproduced, image, of, beckett, it, is, used, on, the, cover, of, the, knowlson, biography, for, instance, this, portrait, was, taken, during, rehearsals, of, the, san, quentin, drama, workshop, at, the, royal, court, theatre, in, london, where, haynes, photographed, many, productions, of,
