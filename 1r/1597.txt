the, field, of, medicine, his, work, helped, to, lay, the, foundation, for, modern, surgical, techniques, and, has, had, a, lasting, impact, on, the, practice, of, medicine, al, zahrawi, specialized, in, curing, disease, by, cauterization, he, invented, several, devices, used, during, surgery, for, purposes, such, as, inspection, of, the, interior, of, the, urethra, and, also, inspection,

the, slave, girl, except, for, a, hoarseness, in, the, voice, which, was, not, extreme, and, after, some, days, she, was, restored, to, the, best, of, health, hence, we, may, say, that, laryngotomy,

treatise, and, the, most, celebrated, one, is, about, surgery, al, zahrawi, stated, that, he, chose, to, discuss, surgery, in, the, last, volume, because, surgery, is, the, highest, form, of, medicine, and, one, must, not, practice, it, until, he, becomes, well, acquainted, with, all, other, branches, of, medicine, the, work, contained, data, that, had, accumulated, during, a, career, that, spanned, almost, 50, years, of, training, teaching, and, practice, in, it, he, also, wrote, of, the, importance, of, a, positive, doctor, patient, relationship, and, wrote, affectionately, of,

observation, of, individual, cases, in, order, to, make, the, most, accurate, diagnosis, and, the, best, possible, treatment, not, always, properly, credited, modern, evaluation, of, kitab, al, tasrif, manuscript, has, revealed, on, early, descriptions, of, some, medical, procedures, that, were, ascribed, to, later, physicians, for, example, al, zahrawi, s, kitab, al, tasrif, described, both, what, would, later, become, known, as, kocher, s, method, for, treating, a, dislocated, shoulder, and, walcher, position, in, obstetrics, moreover, the, kitab, al, tasrif, described, how, to,

headache, that, conforms, to, current, descriptions, of, migraine, al, zahrawi, was, therefore, the, first, to, describe, the, migraine, surgery, procedure, that, is, enjoying, a, revival, in, the, 21st, century, spearheaded, by, elliot, shevel, a, south, african, surgeon, on, surgery, and, instruments, is, the, 30th, and, last, volume, of, the, kitab, al, tasrif, it, was, without, a, doubt, his, most, important, work, and, the, one, which, established, his, authority, in, europe, for, centuries, to, come, on, surgery, and, instruments, is, the, first, illustrated, surgical, guide, ever, written, its, contents, and, descriptions, has, contributed, in, many, technological, innovations, in, medicine, notably, which, tools, to, use, in, specific, surgeries, in, his, book, al, zahrawi, draws, diagrams, of, each, tool, used, in, different, procedures, to, clarify, how, to, carry, out, the, steps, of, each, treatment, the, full, text, consists, of, three, books, intended, for,

12th, century, by, gerard, of, cremona, it, soon, found, popularity, in, europe, and, became, a, standard, text, in, all, major, medical, universities, like, those, of, salerno, and, montpellier, it, remained, the, primary, source, on, surgery, in, europe, for, the, next, 500, years, and, as, the, historian, of, medicine, arturo, castiglioni, has, put, it, al, zahrawi, s, treatise, in, surgery, held, the, same, authority, as, did, the, canon, of, avicenna, in, medicine, al, zahrawi, claims, that, his, knowledge, comes, from, careful, reading, of, previous, medical, texts, as, well, as, his, own, experience, whatever, skill, i, have, i, have, derived, for, myself, by, my, long, reading, of, the, books, of, the, ancients, and, my, thirst, to, understand, them, until, i, extracted, the, knowledge, of, it, from, them, then, through, the, whole, of, my, life, i, have, adhered, to, experience, and, practice, i, have, made, it, accessible, for, you, and, rescued, it, from, the, abyss, of, prolixity, in, the, beginning, of, his, book, al, zahrawi, states, that, the, reason, for, writing, this, treatise, was, the, degree, of, underdevelopment, surgery, had, reached, in, the, islamic, world, and, the, low, status, it, held, amongst, physicians, at, the, time, al, zahrawi, ascribed, such, decline, to, a, lack, of, anatomical, knowledge, and, a, misunderstanding, of, the, human, physiology, he, who, devoted, himself, to, surgery, must, be, versed, in, the, science, of, anatomy, al, zahrawi, kitab, al, tasrif, noting, the, importance, of, anatomy, he, wrote, before, practicing, surgery, one, should, gain, knowledge, of, anatomy, and, the, function, of, organs, so, that, he, will, understand, their, shape, connections, and, borders, he, should, become, thoroughly, familiar, with, nerves, muscles, bones, arteries, and, veins, if, one, does, not, comprehend, the, anatomy, and, physiology, one, can, commit, a, mistake, which, will, result, in, the, death, of, the, patient, i, have, seen, someone, incise, into, a, swelling, in, the, neck, thinking, it, was, an, abscess, when, it, was, an, aneurysm, and, the, patient, dying, on, the, spot, in, urology, al, zahrawi, wrote, about, taking, stones, out, of, the, bladder, by, inventing, a, new, instrument, an, early, form, of, the, lithotrite, which, he, called, michaab, he, was, able, to, crush, the, stone, inside, the, bladder, without, the, need, for, a, surgical, incision, his, technique, was, important, for, the, development, of, lithotomy, and, an, improvement, over, the, existing, techniques, in, europe, which, caused, severe, pain, for, the, patient, and, came, with, high, death, rates, in, dentistry, and, periodontics, al, zahrawi, had, the, most, significant, contribution, out, of, all, muslim, physicians, and, his, book, contained, the, earliest, illustrations, of, dental, instruments, he, was, known, to, use, gold, and, silver, wires, to, ligate, loosened, teeth, and, has, been, credited, as, the, first, to, use, replantation, in, the, history, of, dentistry, he, also, invented, instruments, to, scale, the, calculus, from, the, teeth, a, procedure, he, recommended, as, a, prevention, from, periodontal, disease, al, zahrawi, introduced, over, 200, surgical, instruments, which, include, among, others, different, kinds, of, scalpels, retractors, curettes, pincers, specula, and, also, instruments, designed, for, his, favoured, techniques, of, cauterization, and, ligature, he, also, invented, hooks, with, a, double, tip, for, use, in, surgery, many, of, these, instruments, were, never, used, before, by, any, previous, surgeons, his, use, of, catgut, for, internal, stitching, is, still, practised, in, modern, surgery, the, catgut, appears, to, be, the, only, natural, substance, capable, of, dissolving, and, is, acceptable, by, the, body, an, observation, al, zahrawi, discovered, after, his, monkey, ate, the, strings, of, his, oud, al, zahrawi, also, invented, the, forceps, for, extracting, a, dead, fetus, as, illustrated, in, the, kitab, al, tasrif, throughout, the, text, al, zahrawi, assumes, an, authoritative, tone, in, on, cauterization, for, numbness, he, declares, the, procedure, should, not, be, attempted, except, by, one, who, has, a, good, knowledge, of, the, anatomy, of, the, limbs, and, of, the, exits, of, the, nerves, that, move, the, body, he, warns, that, another, procedure, should, not, be, attempted, by, any, surgeon, lacking, long, training, and, practice, in, the, use, of, cautery, he, is, not, afraid, to, depart, from, old, practice, disparaging, the, opinions, that, cauterization, should, only, be, used, in, the, spring, or, that, gold, is, the, best, material, for, cauterization, cauterization, is, swifter, and, more, successful, with, iron, in, on, cauterization, for, pleurisy, he, notes, that, the, introduction, of, a, red, hot, probe, into, the, intercostal, space, to, evacuate, pus, from, an, abscess, could, result, in, the, creation, of, an, incurable, fistula, or, even, the, immediate, death, of, the, patient, in, pharmacy, and, pharmacology, al, zahrawi, pioneered, the, preparation, of, medicines, by, sublimation, and, distillation, he, dedicated, the, 28th, chapter, of, his, book, to, pharmacy, and, pharmaceutical, techniques, the, chapter, was, later, translated, into, latin, under, the, title, of, liber, servitoris, where, it, served, as, an, important, source, for, european, herbalists, the, book, is, of, particular, interest, as, it, provides, the, reader, with, recipes, and, explains, how, to, prepare, the, simples, from, which, were, compounded, the, complex, drugs, then, generally, used, al, zahrawi, also, touched, upon, the, subject, of, cosmetics, and, dedicated, a, chapter, for, it, in, his, medical, encyclopedia, as, the, treatise, was, translated, into, latin, the, cosmetic, chapter, was, used, in, the, west, al, zahrawi, considered, cosmetics, a, branch, of, medicine, which, he, called, medicine, of, beauty, adwiyat, al, zinah, he, deals, with, perfumes, scented, aromatics, and, incense, he, also, invented, a, perfumed, sticks, rolled, and, pressed, in, special, molds, perhaps, the, earliest, antecedents, of, present, day, lipsticks, and, solid, deodorants, al, zahrawi, was, the, most, frequently, cited, surgical, authority, of, the, middle, ages, donald, campbell, a, historian, of, arabic, medicine, described, al, zahrawi, s, influence, on, europe, as, follows, the, chief, influence, of, albucasis, on, the, medical, system, of, europe, was, that, his, lucidity, and, method, of, presentation, awakened, a, prepossession, in, favour, of, arabic, literature, among, the, scholars, of, the, west, the, methods, of, albucasis, eclipsed, those, of, galen, and, maintained, a, dominant, position, in, medical, europe, for, five, hundred, years, i, e, long, after, it, had, passed, its, usefulness, he, however, helped, to, raise, the, status, of, surgery, in, christian, europe, in, his, book, on, fractures, and, luxations, he, states, that, this, part, of, surgery, has, passed, into, the, hands, of, vulgar, and, uncultivated, minds, for, which, reason, it, has, fallen, into, contempt, the, surgery, of, albucasis, became, firmly, grafted, on, europe, after, the, time, of, guy, de, chauliac, d, 1368, in, the, 14th, century, the, french, surgeon, guy, de, chauliac, quoted, al, tasrif, over, 200, times, pietro, argallata, d, 1453, described, al, zahrawi, as, without, doubt, the, chief, of, all, surgeons, al, zahrawi, s, influence, continued, for, at, least, five, centuries, extending, into, the, renaissance, evidenced, by, al, tasrif, s, frequent, reference, by, french, surgeon, jacques, dal, champs, 1513, 1588, the, street, in, c, rdoba, where, he, lived, is, named, in, his, honor, as, calle, albucasis, on, this, street, he, lived, in, house, no, 6, which, is, preserved, today, by, the, spanish, tourist, board, with, a, bronze, plaque, awarded, in, january, 1977, which, reads, this, was, the, house, where, al, zahrawi, lived
