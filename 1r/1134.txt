elder, the, exarch, of, africa, led, a, revolt, against, the, unpopular, emperor, phocas, heraclius, s, reign, was, marked, by, several, military, campaigns, the, year, heraclius, came, to, power, the, empire, was, threatened, on, multiple, frontiers, heraclius, immediately, took, charge, of, the, byzantine, sasanian, war, of, 602, 628, the, first, battles, of, the, campaign, ended, in, defeat, for, the, byzantines, the, persian, army, fought, their, way, to, the, bosphorus, but, constantinople, was, protected, by, impenetrable, walls, and, a, strong, navy, and, heraclius, was, able, to, avoid, total, defeat, soon, after, he, initiated, reforms, to, rebuild, and, strengthen, the, military, heraclius, drove, the, persians, out, of, asia, minor, and, pushed, deep, into, their, territory, defeating, them, decisively, in, 627, at, the, battle, of, nineveh, the, persian, shah, khosrow, ii, was, overthrown, and, executed, by, his, son, kavad, ii, who, soon, sued, for, a, peace, treaty, agreeing, to, withdraw, from, all, occupied, territory, this, way, peaceful, relations, were, restored, to, the, two, deeply, strained, empires, heraclius, soon, lost, many, of, his, newly, regained, lands, to, the, rashidun, caliphate, emerging, from, the, arabian, peninsula, the, muslims, quickly, conquered, the, sasanian, empire, in, 636, the, muslims, marched, into, roman, syria, defeating, heraclius, s, brother, theodore, within, a, short, period, of, time, the, arabs, conquered, mesopotamia, armenia, and, egypt, heraclius, responded, with, reforms, which, allowed, his, successors, to, combat, the, arabs, and, avoid, total, destruction, one, of, the, most, important, legacies, of, heraclius, was, changing, the, official, language, of, the, empire, from, latin, to, greek, heraclius, entered, diplomatic, relations, with, the, croats, and, serbs, in, the, balkans, he, tried, to, repair, the, schism, in, the, christian, church, in, regard, to, the, monophysites, by, promoting, a, compromise, doctrine, called, monothelitism, the, church, of, the, east, commonly, called, nestorian, was, also, involved, in, the, process, eventually, this, project, of, unity, was, rejected, by, all, sides, of, the, dispute, heraclius, was, the, eldest, son, of, heraclius, the, elder, who, is, almost, universally, recognized, as, being, of, armenian, origin, his, mother, epiphania, was, probably, of, cappadocian, origin, walter, kaegi, considers, heraclius, armenian, origin, probable, and, speculates, that, he, was, presumably, bilingual, armenian, and, greek, from, an, early, age, but, even, this, is, uncertain, according, to, the, 7th, century, armenian, historian, sebeos, heraclius, was, related, to, the, arsacid, dynasty, of, armenia, elizabeth, redgate, considers, his, armenian, origin, likely, anthony, kaldellis, argues, that, there, is, no, primary, source, that, says, that, heraclius, was, an, armenian, and, that, the, assertion, is, based, on, an, erroneous, reading, of, theophylact, simocatta, in, a, letter, priscus, a, general, who, had, replaced, heraclius, the, elder, wrote, to, him, to, leave, the, army, and, return, to, his, own, city, in, armenia, kaldellis, interprets, it, as, the, command, headquarters, of, heraclius, the, elder, and, not, his, hometown, beyond, that, there, is, little, specific, information, known, about, his, origin, his, father, was, a, general, during, emperor, maurice, s, war, with, shah, bahram, chobin, usurper, of, the, sasanian, empire, during, 590, after, the, war, maurice, appointed, heraclius, the, elder, to, the, position, of, exarch, of, africa, in, 608, heraclius, the, elder, renounced, his, loyalty, to, the, emperor, phocas, who, had, overthrown, maurice, six, years, earlier, the, rebels, issued, coins, showing, both, heraclii, dressed, as, hypatos, though, neither, of, them, explicitly, claimed, the, imperial, title, at, this, time, heraclius, s, younger, cousin, nicetas, launched, an, overland, invasion, of, egypt, by, 609, he, had, defeated, phocas, s, general, bonosus, and, secured, the, province, meanwhile, the, younger, heraclius, sailed, eastward, with, another, force, via, sicily, and, cyprus, as, he, approached, constantinople, he, made, contact, with, prominent, leaders, and, planned, an, attack, to, overthrow, aristocrats, in, the, city, when, he, reached, the, capital, the, excubitors, an, elite, imperial, guard, unit, led, by, phocas, s, son, in, law, priscus, deserted, to, heraclius, and, he, entered, the, city, without, serious, resistance, when, heraclius, captured, phocas, he, asked, him, is, this, how, you, have, ruled, wretch, phocas, s, reply, and, will, you, rule, better, so, enraged, heraclius, that, he, beheaded, phocas, on, the, spot, he, later, had, the, genitalia, removed, from, the, body, because, phocas, had, raped, the, wife, of, photius, a, powerful, politician, in, the, city, on, 5, october, 610, heraclius, was, crowned, in, the, chapel, of, st, stephen, within, the, great, palace, he, then, married, fabia, who, took, the, name, eudokia, after, her, death, in, 612, he, married, his, niece, martina, in, 613, this, second, marriage, was, considered, incestuous, and, was, very, unpopular, in, the, reign, of, heraclius, s, two, sons, the, divisive, martina, was, to, become, the, center, of, power, and, political, intrigue, despite, widespread, hatred, for, martina, in, constantinople, heraclius, took, her, on, campaigns, with, him, and, refused, attempts, by, patriarch, sergius, to, prevent, and, later, dissolve, the, marriage, during, his, balkan, campaigns, emperor, maurice, and, his, family, were, murdered, by, phocas, in, november, 602, after, a, mutiny, khosrow, ii, chosroes, of, the, sasanian, empire, had, been, restored, to, his, throne, by, maurice, and, they, had, remained, allies, until, the, latter, s, death, thereafter, khosrow, seized, the, opportunity, to, attack, the, byzantine, empire, and, reconquer, mesopotamia, khosrow, had, at, his, court, a, man, who, claimed, to, be, maurice, s, son, theodosius, and, khosrow, demanded, that, the, byzantines, accept, this, theodosius, as, emperor, the, war, initially, went, the, persians, way, partly, because, of, phocas, s, brutal, repression, and, the, succession, crisis, that, ensued, as, the, general, heraclius, sent, his, nephew, nicetas, to, attack, egypt, enabling, his, son, heraclius, the, younger, to, claim, the, throne, in, 610, phocas, an, unpopular, ruler, who, is, invariably, described, in, historical, sources, as, a, tyrant, in, its, original, meaning, of, the, word, i, e, illegitimate, king, by, the, rules, of, succession, was, eventually, deposed, by, heraclius, who, sailed, to, constantinople, from, carthage, with, an, icon, affixed, to, the, prow, of, his, ship, by, this, time, the, persians, had, conquered, mesopotamia, and, the, caucasus, and, in, 611, they, overran, syria, and, entered, anatolia, a, major, counter, attack, led, by, heraclius, two, years, later, was, decisively, defeated, outside, antioch, by, shahrbaraz, and, shahin, and, the, roman, position, collapsed, the, persians, devastated, parts, of, asia, minor, and, captured, chalcedon, across, from, constantinople, on, the, bosporus, over, the, following, decade, the, persians, were, able, to, conquer, palestine, and, egypt, by, mid, 621, the, whole, province, was, in, their, hands, and, to, devastate, anatolia, while, the, avars, and, slavs, took, advantage, of, the, situation, to, overrun, the, balkans, bringing, the, empire, to, the, brink, of, destruction, in, 613, the, persian, army, took, damascus, with, the, help, of, the, jews, seized, jerusalem, in, 614, damaging, the, church, of, the, holy, sepulchre, and, capturing, the, true, cross, and, afterwards, capturing, egypt, in, 617, or, 618, when, the, sasanians, reached, chalcedon, in, 615, it, was, at, this, point, according, to, sebeos, that, heraclius, had, agreed, to, stand, down, and, was, about, ready, to, allow, the, byzantine, empire, to, become, a, persian, client, state, even, permitting, khosrow, ii, to, choose, the, emperor, in, a, letter, delivered, by, his, ambassadors, heraclius, acknowledged, the, persian, empire, as, superior, described, himself, as, khosrow, ii, s, obedient, son, one, who, is, eager, to, perform, the, services, of, your, serenity, in, all, things, and, even, called, khosrow, ii, the, supreme, emperor, khosrow, ii, nevertheless, rejected, the, peace, offer, and, arrested, heraclius, ambassadors, with, the, persians, at, the, very, gate, of, constantinople, heraclius, thought, of, abandoning, the, city, and, moving, the, capital, to, carthage, but, the, powerful, church, figure, patriarch, sergius, convinced, him, to, stay, safe, behind, the, walls, of, constantinople, heraclius, was, able, to, sue, for, peace, in, exchange, for, an, annual, tribute, of, a, thousand, talents, of, gold, a, thousand, talents, of, silver, a, thousand, silk, robes, a, thousand, horses, and, a, thousand, virgins, to, the, persian, king, the, peace, allowed, him, to, rebuild, the, empire, s, army, by, slashing, non, military, expenditure, devaluing, the, currency, and, melting, down, with, the, backing, of, patriarch, sergius, church, treasures, to, raise, the, necessary, funds, to, continue, the, war, on, 4, april, 622, heraclius, left, constantinople, entrusting, the, city, to, sergius, and, general, bonus, as, regents, of, his, son, he, assembled, his, forces, in, asia, minor, probably, in, bithynia, and, after, he, revived, their, broken, morale, he, launched, a, new, counter, offensive, which, took, on, the, character, of, a, holy, war, an, acheiropoietos, image, of, christ, was, carried, as, a, military, standard, the, roman, army, proceeded, to, armenia, inflicted, a, defeat, on, an, army, led, by, a, persian, allied, arab, chief, and, then, won, a, victory, over, the, persians, under, shahrbaraz, heraclius, would, stay, on, campaign, for, several, years, on, 25, march, 624, he, again, left, constantinople, with, his, wife, martina, and, his, two, children, after, he, celebrated, easter, in, nicomedia, on, 15, april, he, campaigned, in, the, caucasus, winning, a, series, of, victories, in, armenia, against, khosrow, and, his, generals, shahrbaraz, shahin, and, shahraplakan, in, the, same, year, the, visigoths, succeeded, in, recapturing, cartagena, capital, of, the, western, byzantine, province, of, spania, resulting, in, the, loss, of, one, of, the, few, minor, provinces, that, had, been, conquered, by, the, armies, of, justinian, i, in, 626, the, avars, and, slavs, supported, by, a, persian, army, commanded, by, shahrbaraz, besieged, constantinople, but, the, siege, ended, in, failure, the, victory, was, attributed, to, the, icons, of, the, virgin, which, were, led, in, procession, by, sergius, about, the, walls, of, the, city, while, a, second, persian, army, under, shahin, suffered, another, crushing, defeat, at, the, hands, of, heraclius, s, brother, theodore, with, the, persian, war, effort, disintegrating, heraclius, was, able, to, bring, the, gokturks, of, the, western, turkic, khaganate, under, ziebel, who, invaded, persian, transcaucasia, heraclius, exploited, divisions, within, the, persian, empire, keeping, shahrbaraz, neutral, by, convincing, him, that, khosrow, had, grown, jealous, of, him, and, had, ordered, his, execution, late, in, 627, he, launched, a, winter, offensive, into, mesopotamia, where, despite, the, desertion, of, his, turkish, allies, he, defeated, the, persians, under, rhahzadh, at, the, battle, of, nineveh, continuing, south, along, the, tigris, he, sacked, khosrow, s, great, palace, at, dastagird, and, was, only, prevented, from, attacking, ctesiphon, by, the, destruction, of, the, bridges, on, the, nahrawan, canal, discredited, by, this, series, of, disasters, khosrow, was, overthrown, and, killed, in, a, coup, led, by, his, son, kavad, ii, who, at, once, sued, for, peace, agreeing, to, withdraw, from, all, occupied, territories, in, 629, heraclius, restored, the, true, cross, to, jerusalem, in, a, majestic, ceremony, heraclius, took, for, himself, the, ancient, persian, title, of, king, of, kings, after, his, victory, later, on, starting, in, 629, he, styled, himself, as, basileus, the, greek, word, for, sovereign, and, that, title, was, used, by, the, byzantine, emperors, for, the, next, 800, years, the, reason, heraclius, chose, this, title, over, previous, roman, terms, such, as, augustus, has, been, attributed, by, some, scholars, to, his, armenian, origins, heraclius, s, defeat, of, the, persians, ended, a, war, that, had, been, going, on, intermittently, for, almost, 400, years, and, led, to, instability, in, the, persian, empire, kavad, ii, died, only, months, after, assuming, the, throne, plunging, persia, into, several, years, of, dynastic, turmoil, and, civil, war, ardashir, iii, heraclius, s, ally, shahrbaraz, and, khosrow, s, daughters, boran, and, azarmidokht, all, succeeded, to, the, throne, within, months, of, each, other, only, when, yazdegerd, iii, a, grandson, of, khosrow, ii, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 632, was, there, stability, but, by, then, the, sasanid, empire, was, severely, disorganised, having, been, weakened, by, years, of, war, and, civil, strife, over, the, succession, to, the, throne, the, war, had, been, devastating, and, left, the, byzantines, in, a, much, weakened, state, within, a, few, years, both, empires, were, overwhelmed, by, the, onslaught, of, the, arabs, ultimately, leading, to, the, muslim, conquest, of, persia, and, the, fall, of, the, sasanian, dynasty, in, 651, by, 630, the, arabs, had, unified, all, the, tribes, of, the, hijaz, previously, too, divided, to, pose, a, serious, military, challenge, to, the, byzantines, or, the, persians, they, composed, one, of, the, most, powerful, states, in, the, region, the, first, conflict, between, the, byzantines, and, the, arabs, was, the, battle, of, mu, tah, in, september, 629, a, small, arabs, skirmishing, force, attacked, the, province, of, arabia, in, response, to, the, arab, ambassador, s, death, at, the, hands, of, the, ghassanid, roman, governor, but, were, repulsed, since, the, engagement, was, a, byzantine, victory, there, was, no, apparent, reason, to, make, changes, to, the, military, organization, of, the, region, the, roman, military, wasn, t, accustomed, to, fighting, arab, armies, at, scale, much, like, the, islamic, forces, of, hijaz, who, had, no, prior, experience, in, their, engagements, against, the, romans, even, the, strategicon, of, maurice, a, manual, of, war, praised, for, the, variety, of, enemies, it, covers, does, not, mention, warfare, against, arabs, at, any, length, the, religious, zeal, of, the, arab, army, which, was, a, recent, development, following, the, rise, of, islam, ultimately, contributed, to, the, latter, s, success, in, its, campaigns, against, the, romans, the, following, year, the, arabs, launched, an, offensive, into, the, arabah, south, of, lake, tiberias, taking, al, karak, other, raids, penetrated, into, the, negev, reaching, as, far, as, gaza, the, battle, of, yarmouk, in, 636, resulted, in, a, crushing, defeat, for, the, larger, byzantine, army, within, three, years, the, levant, had, been, lost, again, heraclius, died, of, an, illness, on, 11, february, 641, and, most, of, egypt, had, fallen, by, that, time, as, well, looking, back, at, the, reign, of, heraclius, scholars, have, credited, him, with, many, accomplishments, he, enlarged, the, empire, and, his, reorganization, of, the, government, and, military, were, great, successes, his, attempts, at, religious, harmony, failed, but, he, succeeded, in, returning, the, true, cross, one, of, the, holiest, christian, relics, to, jerusalem, although, the, territories, recovered, by, his, defeat, of, the, persians, were, annulled, again, by, the, early, muslim, conquests, heraclius, still, ranks, among, the, great, roman, emperors, his, reforms, of, the, government, reduced, the, corruption, which, had, taken, hold, in, phocas, s, reign, and, he, reorganized, the, military, with, great, success, ultimately, the, reformed, imperial, army, halted, the, muslims, in, asia, minor, and, held, on, to, carthage, for, another, 60, years, saving, a, core, from, which, the, empire, s, strength, could, be, rebuilt, the, recovery, of, the, eastern, areas, of, the, roman, empire, from, the, persians, once, again, raised, the, problem, of, religious, unity, centering, on, the, understanding, of, the, true, nature, of, christ, most, of, the, inhabitants, of, these, provinces, were, monophysites, who, rejected, the, council, of, chalcedon, heraclius, tried, to, promote, a, compromise, doctrine, called, monothelitism, but, this, philosophy, was, rejected, as, heretical, by, both, sides, of, the, dispute, for, this, reason, heraclius, was, viewed, as, a, heretic, and, a, bad, ruler, by, some, later, religious, writers, after, the, monophysite, provinces, were, finally, lost, to, the, muslims, monotheletism, rather, lost, its, raison, d, tre, and, was, eventually, abandoned, the, croats, and, serbs, of, byzantine, dalmatia, initiated, diplomatic, relations, and, dependencies, with, heraclius, the, serbs, who, briefly, lived, in, macedonia, became, foederati, and, were, baptized, at, the, request, of, heraclius, before, 626, at, his, request, pope, john, iv, 640, 642, sent, christian, teachers, and, missionaries, to, duke, porga, and, his, croats, who, practiced, slavic, paganism, he, also, created, the, office, of, sakellarios, a, comptroller, of, the, treasury, up, to, the, 20th, century, he, was, credited, with, establishing, the, thematic, system, but, modern, scholarship, now, points, more, to, the, 660s, under, constans, ii, edward, gibbon, in, the, history, of, the, decline, and, fall, of, the, roman, empire, wrote, of, the, characters, conspicuous, in, history, that, of, heraclius, is, one, of, the, most, extraordinary, and, inconsistent, in, the, first, and, last, years, of, a, long, reign, the, emperor, appears, to, be, the, slave, of, sloth, of, pleasure, or, of, superstition, the, careless, and, impotent, spectator, of, the, public, calamities, but, the, languid, mists, of, the, morning, and, evening, are, separated, by, the, brightness, of, the, meridian, sun, the, arcadius, of, the, palace, arose, the, caesar, of, the, camp, and, the, honor, of, rome, and, heraclius, was, gloriously, retrieved, by, the, exploits, and, trophies, of, six, adventurous, campaigns, since, the, days, of, scipio, and, hannibal, no, bolder, enterprise, has, been, attempted, than, that, which, heraclius, achieved, for, the, deliverance, of, the, empire, heraclius, was, long, remembered, favourably, by, the, western, church, for, his, reputed, recovery, of, the, true, cross, from, the, persians, as, heraclius, approached, the, persian, capital, during, the, final, stages, of, the, war, khosrow, fled, from, his, favourite, residence, dastagird, near, baghdad, without, offering, resistance, meanwhile, some, of, the, persian, grandees, freed, khosrow, s, eldest, son, kavad, ii, who, had, been, imprisoned, by, his, father, and, proclaimed, him, king, on, the, night, of, 23, 24, february, 628, kavad, however, was, mortally, ill, and, was, anxious, that, heraclius, should, protect, his, infant, son, ardeshir, so, as, a, goodwill, gesture, he, sent, the, true, cross, with, a, negotiator, in, 628, after, a, tour, of, the, empire, heraclius, returned, the, cross, to, jerusalem, on, 21, march, 629, or, 630, for, christians, of, western, medieval, europe, heraclius, was, the, first, crusader, the, iconography, of, the, emperor, appeared, in, the, sanctuary, at, mont, saint, michel, ca, 1060, and, then, it, became, popular, especially, in, france, the, italian, peninsula, and, the, holy, roman, empire, the, story, was, included, in, the, golden, legend, the, famous, 13th, century, compendium, of, hagiography, and, he, is, sometimes, shown, in, art, as, in, the, history, of, the, true, cross, sequence, of, frescoes, painted, by, piero, della, francesca, in, arezzo, and, a, similar, sequence, on, a, small, altarpiece, by, adam, elsheimer, st, del, frankfurt, both, of, these, show, scenes, of, heraclius, and, constantine, i, s, mother, saint, helena, traditionally, responsible, for, the, excavation, of, the, cross, the, scene, usually, shown, is, heraclius, carrying, the, cross, according, to, the, golden, legend, he, insisted, on, doing, this, as, he, entered, jerusalem, against, the, advice, of, the, patriarch, at, first, when, he, was, on, horseback, shown, above, the, burden, was, too, heavy, but, after, he, dismounted, and, removed, his, crown, it, became, miraculously, light, and, the, barred, city, gate, opened, of, its, own, accord, local, tradition, suggests, that, the, late, antique, colossus, of, barletta, depicts, heraclius, some, scholars, disagree, with, this, narrative, professor, constantin, zuckerman, going, as, far, as, to, suggest, that, the, true, cross, was, actually, lost, and, that, the, wood, contained, in, the, allegedly, still, sealed, reliquary, brought, to, jerusalem, by, heraclius, in, 629, was, a, fake, in, his, analysis, the, hoax, was, designed, to, serve, the, political, purposes, of, both, heraclius, and, his, former, foe, the, persian, general, shahrbaraz, in, early, islamic, and, arab, histories, heraclius, is, the, most, popular, roman, emperor, who, is, discussed, at, length, owing, to, his, role, as, roman, emperor, at, the, time, islam, emerged, he, is, remembered, in, arabic, literature, such, as, the, islamic, hadith, and, sira, he, is, also, indirectly, mentioned, in, sura, ar, rum, and, his, victory, against, sassanid, empire, was, prophesied, here, in, the, third, and, fourth, verses, the, muslim, community, is, promised, that, the, byzantines, will, reverse, their, defeat, into, a, victory, and, retake, jerusalem, in, a, few, years, time, the, romans, were, vanquished, in, the, closer, region, and, they, after, being, vanquished, will, prevail, within, a, certain, number, of, from, 3, to, 9, years, to, god, belongs, the, command, before, and, after, and, that, day, ones, who, believe, will, be, glad, with, the, help, of, god, he, helps, whom, he, wills, and, he, is, the, almighty, the, compassionate, according, to, islamic, traditions, a, letter, was, sent, from, muhammad, to, heraclius, through, the, muslim, envoy, dihyah, bin, khalifah, al, kalbi, although, shahid, suggests, that, heraclius, may, never, have, received, it, he, also, advances, that, more, positive, sub, narratives, surrounding, the, letter, contain, little, credence, according, to, nadia, el, cheikh, arab, historians, and, chroniclers, generally, did, not, doubt, the, authenticity, of, heraclius, letter, due, to, the, documentation, of, such, letters, in, the, majority, of, both, early, and, later, sources, furthermore, she, notes, that, the, formulation, and, the, wordings, of, different, sources, are, very, close, and, the, differences, are, ones, of, detail, they, concern, the, date, on, which, the, letter, was, sent, and, its, exact, phrasing, muhammad, hamidullah, an, islamic, research, scholar, argues, for, the, authenticity, of, the, letter, sent, to, heraclius, and, in, a, later, work, reproduces, what, is, claimed, to, be, the, original, letter, the, account, as, transmitted, by, muslim, historians, is, translated, as, follows, in, the, name, of, god, the, gracious, one, the, merciful, from, muhammad, servant, of, god, and, his, apostle, to, heraclius, premier, of, the, romans, peace,

reward, two, folds, but, if, you, turn, away, then, upon, you, will, sins, of, the, peasants, then, o, people, of, the, scripture, come, to, a, term, equitable, between, us, and, you, that, we, worship, none, but, god, and, associate, with, him, nothing, and, we, take, not, one, another, as, lords, apart, from, god, but, if, they, turn, away, then, say, bear, witness, that, we, peace, makers, seal, muhammad, apostle, of, god, according, to, islamic, reports, muhammad, dispatched, dihyah, al, kalbi, to, carry, the, epistle, to, caesar, through, the, government, of, bosra, after, the, byzantine, defeat, of, the, persians, and, reconquest, of, jerusalem, islamic, sources, say, that, after, the, letter, was, read, to, him, he, was, so, impressed, by, it, that, he, gifted, the, messenger, of, the, epistle, with, robes, and, coinage, alternatively, he, also, put, it, on, his, lap, he, then, summoned, abu, sufyan, ibn, harb, to, his, court, at, the, time, an, adversary, to, muhammad, but, a, signatory, to, the, then, recent, treaty, of, hudaybiyyah, who, was, trading, in, the, region, of, syria, at, the, time, asked, by, heraclius, about, the, man, claiming, to, be, a, prophet, abu, sufyan, responded, speaking, favorably, of, muhammad, s, character, and, lineage, and, outlining, some, directives, of, islam, heraclius, was, seemingly, impressed, by, what, he, was, told, of, muhammad, and, felt, that, muhammad, s, claim, to, prophethood, was, valid, later, reportedly, he, wrote, to, a, certain, religious, official, in, rome, to, confirm, if, muhammad, s, claim, of, prophethood, was, legitimate, and, after, receiving, the, reply, to, his, letter, called, the, roman, assembly, saying, if, you, desire, salvation, and, the, orthodox, way, so, that, your, empire, remain, firmly, established, then, follow, this, prophet, to, the, rejection, of, the, council, heraclius, eventually, decided, against, conversion, but, the, envoy, was, returned, to, medina, with, the, felicitations, of, the, emperor, scholarly, historians, disagree, with, this, account, arguing, that, any, such, messengers, would, have, received, neither, an, imperial, audience, or, recognition, and, that, there, is, no, evidence, outside, of, islamic, sources, suggesting, that, heraclius, had, any, knowledge, of, islam, this, letter, is, mentioned, in, sahih, al, bukhari, the, swahili, utendi, wa, tambuka, an, epic, poem, composed, in, 1728, at, pate, island, off, the, shore, of, present, day, kenya, and, depicting, the, wars, between, the, muslims, and, byzantines, from, the, former, s, point, of, view, is, also, known, as, kyuo, kya, here, ali, the, book, of, heraclius, in, that, work, heraclius, is, portrayed, as, declining, the, prophet, s, request, to, renounce, his, belief, in, christianity, he, is, therefore, defeated, by, the, muslim, forces, in, muslim, tradition, he, is, seen, as, a, just, ruler, of, great, piety, who, had, direct, contact, with, the, emerging, islamic, forces, the, 14th, century, scholar, ibn, kathir, d, 1373, went, even, further, stating, that, heraclius, was, one, of, the, wisest, men, and, among, the, most, resolute, shrewd, deep, and, opinionated, of, kings, he, ruled, the, romans, with, great, leadership, and, splendor, historians, such, as, nadia, maria, el, cheikh, and, lawrence, conrad, note, that, islamic, histories, even, go, so, far, as, claiming, that, heraclius, recognized, islam, as, the, true, faith, and, muhammad, as, its, prophet, by, comparing, islam, to, christianity, islamic, historians, often, cite, a, letter, in, which, they, claim, heraclius, wrote, to, muhammad, i, have, received, your, letter, with, your, ambassador, and, i, testify, that, you, are, the, messenger, of, god, found, in, our, new, testament, jesus, son, of, mary, announced, you, according, to, the, muslim, sources, reported, by, el, cheikh, he, tried, to, convert, the, ruling, class, of, the, empire, but, they, resisted, so, strongly, that, he, reversed, course, and, claimed, that, he, was, just, testing, their, faith, in, christianity, el, cheikh, notes, that, these, accounts, of, heraclius, add, little, to, our, historical, knowledge, of, the, emperor, rather, they, are, an, important, part, of, islamic, kerygma, attempting, to, legitimize, muhammad, s, status, as, a, prophet, most, western, academic, historians, view, such, traditions, as, biased, and, proclamatory, and, of, little, historical, value, furthermore, they, argue, that, any, messengers, sent, by, muhammad, to, heraclius, would, not, have, received, an, imperial, audience, or, recognition, according, to, kaegi, there, is, no, evidence, outside, of, islamic, sources, to, suggest, heraclius, ever, heard, of, islam, and, it, is, possible, that, he, and, his, advisors, actually, viewed, the, muslims, as, some, special, sect, of, jews, al, waqidi, recorded, a, story, about, a, trader, acting, as, a, spy, in, medina, from, the, lakhmid, kingdom, who, reported, the, coming, of, the, muslim, forces, before, the, battle, of, the, yarmuk, he, described, the, caliph, abu, bakr, to, him, as, an, ordinary, looking, man, who, roams, the, market, ensuring, the, strong, fulfill, the, rights, of, the, weak, and, that, he, treats, the, strong, and, the, weak, equally, he, then, describes, his, physical, features, and, heraclius, states, that, there, is, a, successor, to, the, prophet, muhammad, who, is, described, as, black, eyed, tall, wheat, colored, like, a, lion, and, would, expel, his, enemies, from, their, lands, the, lakhmid, spy, responds, that, he, has, a, companion, the, second, caliph, umar, like, this, heraclius, then, responded, that, he, is, fully, convinced, of, this, fulfilled, prophecy, that, he, tried, previously, to, convince, the, romans, and, invite, them, to, salvation, islam, but, none, listened, to, him, and, soon, the, romans, would, be, expelled, from, syria, heraclius, was, married, twice, first, to, fabia, eudokia, a, daughter, of, rogatus, and, then, to, his, niece, martina, he, had, two, children, with, fabia, eudoxia, epiphania, and, emperor, constantine, iii, and, at, least, nine, with, martina, many, of, whom, were, sickly, children, of, martina, s, children, at, least, two, were, disabled, which, was, seen, as, punishment, for, the, illegality, of, the, marriage, fabius, had, a, paralyzed, neck, and, theodosius, was, a, deaf, mute, the, latter, married, nike, daughter, of, the, persian, general, shahrbaraz, or, daughter, of, niketas, cousin, of, heraclius, two, of, heraclius, s, children, would, become, emperor, heraclius, constantine, constantine, iii, his, son, with, eudokia, and, martina, s, son, heraclius, heraclonas, constantine, was, crowned, co, emperor, augustus, on, 22, january, 613, at, the, age, of, 8, months, heraclonas, was, made, caesar, on, 1, january, 632, aged, 6, and, was, later, crowned, augustus, on, 4, july, 638, they, ruled, for, a, few, months, in, 641, but, were, eventually, succeeded, by, constans, ii, the, son, of, constantine, iii, by, the, end, of, the, year, heraclius, had, at, least, one, illegitimate, son, john, athalarichos, who, conspired, against, heraclius, with, his, cousin, the, magister, theodorus, and, the, armenian, noble, david, saharuni, when, heraclius, discovered, the, plot, he, had, athalarichos, s, nose, and, hands, cut, off, and, he, was, exiled, to, prinkipo, one, of, the, princes, islands, theodorus, received, the, same, treatment, but, was, sent, to, gaudomelete, possibly, modern, day, gozo, island, with, additional, instructions, to, cut, off, one, leg, during, the, last, years, of, heraclius, s, life, it, became, evident, that, a, struggle, was, taking, place, between, heraclius, constantine, and, martina, who, was, trying, to, position, her, son, heraclonas, to, assume, the, throne, when, heraclius, died, he, devised, the, empire, to, both, heraclius, constantine, and, heraclonas, to, rule, jointly, with, martina, as, empress
