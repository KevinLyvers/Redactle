the, politically, influential, patrician, robert, livingston, and, robert, fulton, who, had, designed, the, steamboat, though, both, livingston, and, fulton, had, died, by, the, time, vanderbilt,

river, that, year, he, faced, opposition, by, a, steamboat, operated, by, daniel, drew, who, forced, vanderbilt, to, buy, him, out, impressed, vanderbilt, became, a, secret, partner, with, drew, for, the, next, thirty, years, so, that, the, two, men, would, have, an, incentive, to, avoid, competing, with, each, other, 72, 84, 87, on, november, 8, 1833, vanderbilt, was, nearly, killed, in, the,

language, associated, with, democratic, president, andrew, jackson, to, get, popular, support, for, his, business, at, the, end, of, the, year, the, monopoly, paid, him, a, large, amount, to, stop, competing, and, he, switched, his, operations, to, long, island, sound, 99, 104, during, the, 1830s, textile, mills, were, built, in, large, numbers, in, new, england, as, the, united, states,

launched, a, campaign, to, take, over, the, most, attractive, of, these, lines, the, new, york, providence, and, boston, railroad, popularly, known, as, the, stonington, by, cutting, fares, on, competing, lines, vanderbilt, drove, down, the, stonington, stock, price, and, took, over, the, presidency, of, the, company, in, 1847, it, was, the, first, of, the, many, railroads, he, would, head, 119, 46, during, these, years, vanderbilt, also, operated, many, other, businesses, he, bought, large, amounts, of, real, estate, in, manhattan, and, staten, island, and, took, over, the, staten,

steamboat, entrepreneurs, by, the, end, of, the, 1840s, it, was, applied, only, to, vanderbilt, 124, 27, when, the, california, gold, rush, began, in, 1849, vanderbilt, switched, from, regional, steamboat, lines, to, ocean, going, steamships, many, of, the, migrants, to, california, and, almost, all, of, the, gold, returning, to, the, east, coast, went, by, steamship, to, panama, where, mule, trains, and, canoes, provided, transportation, across, the, isthmus, the, panama, railroad, was, soon, built, to, provide, a, faster, crossing, vanderbilt, proposed, a, canal, across, nicaragua, which, was, closer, to, the, united, states, and, was, spanned, most, of, the, way, across, by, lake, nicaragua, and, the, san, juan, river, in, the, end, he, could, not, attract, enough, investment, to, build, the, canal, but, he, did, start, a, steamship, line, to, nicaragua, and, founded, the, accessory, transit, company, to, carry, passengers, across, nicaragua, by, steamboat, on, the, lake, and, river, with, a, 12, mile, 19, kilometer, carriage, road, between, the, pacific, port, of, san, juan, del, sur, and, virgin, bay, on, lake, nicaragua, 174, 205, in, 1852, a, dispute, with, joseph, l, white, a, partner, in, the, accessory, transit, company, led, to, a, business, battle, in, which, vanderbilt, forced, the, company, to, buy, his, ships, for, an, inflated, price, in, early, 1853, he, took, his, family, on, a, grand, tour, of, europe, in, his, steamship, yacht, the, north, star, while, he, was, away, white, conspired, with, charles, morgan, vanderbilt, s, erstwhile, ally, to, betray, him, and, deny, him, money, he, was, owed, by, the, accessory, transit, company, when, vanderbilt, returned, from, europe, he, retaliated, by, developing, a, rival, steamship, line, to, california, cutting, prices, until, he, forced, morgan, and, white, to, pay, him, off, he, then, turned, to, transatlantic, steamship, lines, running, in, opposition, to, the, heavily, subsidized, collins, line, headed, by, edward, k, collins, vanderbilt, eventually, drove, the, collins, line, into, extinction, during, the, 1850s, vanderbilt, also, bought, control, of, a, major, shipyard, and, the, allaire, iron, works, a, leading, manufacturer, of, marine, steam, engines, in, manhattan, 217, 264, in, november, 1855, vanderbilt, began, to, buy, control, of, accessory, transit, once, again, that, same, year, the, american, military, adventurer, william, walker, led, an, expedition, to, nicaragua, and, briefly, took, control, of, the, government, edmund, randolph, a, close, friend, of, walker, coerced, the, accessory, transit, s, san, francisco, agent, cornelius, k, garrison, into, opposing, vanderbilt, randolph, convinced, walker, to, annul, the, charter, of, the, accessory, transit, company, and, give, the, transit, rights, and, company, steamboats, to, him, randolph, sold, these, to, garrison, garrison, brought, charles, morgan, in, new, york, into, the, plan, vanderbilt, took, control, of, the, company, just, before, these, developments, were, announced, when, he, tried, to, convince, the, u, s, and, english, governments, to, help, restore, the, company, to, its, rights, and, property, they, refused, so, he, negotiated, with, costa, rica, which, along, with, the, other, central, american, republics, had, declared, war, on, walker, vanderbilt, sent, a, man, to, costa, rica, who, led, a, raid, that, captured, the, steamboats, on, the, san, juan, river, cutting, walker, off, from, his, reinforcements, from, insurgent, groups, in, the, united, states, walker, was, forced, to, give, up, and, was, driven, out, of, the, country, by, a, u, s, navy, officer, but, the, new, nicaraguan, government, refused, to, allow, vanderbilt, to, restart, the, transit, business, so, he, started, a, line, by, way, of, panama, eventually, developing, a, monopoly, on, the, california, steamship, business, 268, 327, when, the, civil, war, began, in, 1861, vanderbilt, attempted, to, donate, his, largest, steamship, the, vanderbilt, to, the, union, navy, secretary, of, the, navy, gideon, welles, refused, it, thinking, its, operation, and, maintenance, too, expensive, for, what, he, expected, to, be, a, short, war, vanderbilt, had, little, choice, but, to, lease, it, to, the, war, department, at, prices, set, by, ship, brokers, when, the, confederate, ironclad, virginia, popularly, known, in, the, north, as, the, merrimack, wrought, havoc, with, the, union, blockading, squadron, at, hampton, roads, virginia, secretary, of, war, edwin, stanton, and, president, abraham, lincoln, called, on, vanderbilt, for, help, this, time, he, succeeded, in, donating, the, vanderbilt, to, the, union, navy, equipping, it, with, a, ram, and, staffing, it, with, handpicked, officers, it, helped, bottle, up, the, virginia, after, which, vanderbilt, converted, it, into, a, cruiser, to, hunt, for, the, confederate, commerce, raider, alabama, captained, by, raphael, semmes, for, donating, the, vanderbilt, he, was, awarded, a, congressional, gold, medal, vanderbilt, also, paid, to, outfit, a, major, expedition, to, new, orleans, he, suffered, a, grievous, loss, when, george, washington, vanderbilt, ii, his, youngest, and, favorite, son, and, heir, apparent, a, graduate, of, the, united, states, military, academy, fell, ill, and, died, without, ever, seeing, combat, 341, 64, though, vanderbilt, had, relinquished, his, presidency, of, the, stonington, railroad, during, the, california, gold, rush, he, took, an, interest, in, several, railroads, during, the, 1850s, serving, on, the, boards, of, directors, of, the, erie, railway, the, central, railroad, of, new, jersey, the, hartford, and, new, haven, and, the, new, york,

he, wanted, to, show, that, he, could, take, this, railroad, which, was, generally, considered, worthless, and, make, it, valuable, it, had, a, key, advantage, it, was, the, only, steam, railroad, to, enter, the, center, of, manhattan, running, down, 4th, avenue, later, park, avenue, to, a, station, on, 26th, street, where, it, connected, with, a, horse, drawn, streetcar, line, from, manhattan, it, ran, up, to, chatham, four, corners, new, york, where, it, had, a, connection, to, the, railroads, running, east, and, west, 365, 386, vanderbilt, brought, his, eldest, son, billy, in, as, vice, president, of, the, harlem, billy, had, had, a, nervous, breakdown, early, in, life, and, his, father, had, sent, him, to, a, farm, on, staten, island, but, he, proved, himself, a, good, businessman, and, eventually, became, the, head, of, the, staten, island, railway, though, the, commodore, had, once, scorned, billy, he, was, impressed, by, his, son, s, success, eventually, he, promoted, him, to, operational, manager, of, all, his, railroad, lines, in, 1864, the, commodore, sold, his, last, ships, in, order, to, concentrate, on, the, railroads, 387, 90, once, in, charge, of, the, harlem,

the, new, york, central, railroad, in, 1867, and, the, lake, shore, and, michigan, southern, railway, in, 1869, he, later, bought, the, canada, southern, as, well, in, 1870, he, consolidated, two, of,

vanderbilt, fell, into, a, dispute, with, daniel, drew, who, had, become, treasurer, of, the, erie, railway, to, get, revenge, he, tried, to, corner, erie, stock, which, led, to, the, so, called, erie, war, this, brought, him, into, direct, conflict, with, jay, gould, and, financier, james, fisk, jr, who, had, just, joined, drew, on, the, erie, board, they, defeated, the, corner, by, issuing, watered, stock, in, defiance, of, state, law, which, restricted, the, number, of, shares, a, company, could, issue, 207, 32, but, gould, bribed, the, legislature, to, legalize, the, new, stock, 262, 64, vanderbilt, used, the, leverage, of, a, lawsuit, to, recover, his, losses, but, he, and, gould, became, public, enemies, gould, never, got, the, better, of, vanderbilt, in, any, other, important, business, matter, but, he, often, embarrassed, vanderbilt, who, uncharacteristically, lashed, out, at, gould, in, public, by, contrast, vanderbilt, befriended, his, other, foes, after, their, fights, ended, including, drew, and, cornelius, garrison, following, his, wife, sophia, s, death, in, 1868, vanderbilt, went, to, canada, on, august, 21, 1869, in, london, ontario, he, married, a, cousin,

death, was, exhaustion, brought, on, by, long, suffering, from, a, complication, of, chronic, disorders, at, the, time, of, his, death, aged, 82, vanderbilt, had, an, estimated, worth, of, 105, million, 3, 004, 312, 500, in, 2023, dollars, in, his, will, he, left, 95, of, his, 105, million, estate, to, his, son, william, billy, and, four, grandsons, through, him, this, left, his, only,

juliette, to, receive, comparatively, little, inheritance, far, less, than, even, their, young, nephews, corneel, ethelinda, and, mary, took, the, matter, of, their, father, s, will, to, court, claiming, he, was, not, in, his, right, mind, in, his, old, age, when, he, drew, up, the, will, that, he, had, been, behaving, strangely, and, was, under, william, s, influence, as, well, as, that, of, a, corrupt, spiritualist, in, his, employ, who, d, allegedly, been, approached, and, paid, off, by, william, to, do, his, bidding, according, to, eyewitness, testimony, allegedly, william, paid, the, spiritualist, a, mr, stoddard, to, suggest, the, spirits, during, a, point, in, the, session, when, said, spiritualist, would, fall, into, a, trance, in, the, commodore, s, presence, claimed, william, would, be, the, most, trustworthy, to, inherit, the, estate, and, business, and, that, his, other, children, actually, hated, him, and, were, just, waiting, for, him, to, die, a, spirit, during, this, session, came, in, the, form, of, william, s, deceased, mother, sophia, not, wanting, to, risk, further, public, humiliation, of, the, family, name, in, court, william, finally, settled, with, his, siblings, he, gave, corneel, an, extra, 200, 000, in, cash, and, a, trust, fund, of, 400, 000, he, gave, mary, and, ethelinda, the, same, settlement, still, all, told, this, was, comparatively, very, little, from, the, by, far, largest, estate, in, the, world, at, that, time, william, s, eldest, son, cornelius, vanderbilt, ii, received, 5, million, in, the, will, while, his, three, younger, sons, william, kissam, vanderbilt, frederick, william, vanderbilt, and, george, washington, vanderbilt, ii, received, 2, million, apiece, vanderbilt, willed, amounts, ranging, from, 250, 000, to, 500, 000, to, each, of, his, daughters, his, wife, received, 500, 000, their, new, york, city, home, and, 2, 000, shares, of, common, stock, in, the, new, york, central, railroad, to, his, younger, surviving, son, cornelius, jeremiah, vanderbilt, whom, he, regarded, as, a, wastrel, he, left, the, income, from, a, 200, 000, trust, fund, although, his, daughters, and, cornelius, received, bequests, much, smaller, than, those, of, their, brother, william, these, made, them, very, wealthy, by, the, standards, of, 1877, and, were, not, subject, to, inheritance, tax, vanderbilt, s, biographer, t, j, stiles, says, he, vastly, improved, and, expanded, the, nation, s, transportation, infrastructure, contributing, to, a, transformation, of, the, very, geography, of, the, united, states, he, embraced, new, technologies, and, new, forms, of, business, organization, and, used, them, to, compete, he, helped, to, create, the, corporate, economy, that, would, define, the, united, states, into, the, 21st, century, the, commodore, had, lived, in, relative, modesty, considering, his, nearly, unlimited, means, splurging, only, on, race, horses, his, descendants, were, the, ones, who, built, the, vanderbilt, houses, that, characterize, the, united, states, gilded, age, according, to, the, wealthy, 100, by, michael, klepper, and, robert, gunther, vanderbilt, would, be, worth, 143, billion, in, 2007, united, states, dollars, if, his, total, wealth, as, a, share, of, the, nation, s, gross, domestic, product, gdp, in, 1877, the, year, of, his, death, were, taken, and, applied, in, that, same, proportion, in, 2007, this, would, make, him, the, second, wealthiest, person, in, united, states, history, after, standard, oil, co, founder, john, davison, rockefeller,
