is, this, it, is, this, it, is, this, this, verse, is, believed, to, have, been, inscribed, on, several, mughal, structures, supposedly, in, reference, to, kashmir, specifically, a, particular, building, at, the, shalimar, garden, in, srinagar, kashmir, built, during, the, reign, of, mughal, emperor, jahangir, however, recent, scholarship, has, traced, the, verse, to, a, time, much, later,

in, the, late, 13th, century, to, create, qawwali, a, form, of, sufi, devotional, song, a, well, punctuated, chorus, emphasising, the, theme, and, devotional, refrain, coupled, with, a, lead, singer, utilising, an, ornate, style, of, fast, taans, and, difficult, svara, combinations, are, the, distinguishing, characteristics, of, a, qawwali, khusrau, s, disciples, who, specialised, in, qawwali,

poems, has, made, them, favorites, of, musicians, even, today, tarana, and, trivat, are, also, credited, to, khusrau, musicologist, and, philosopher, jaidev, singh, has, said, tarana, was, entirely, an, invention, of, khusrau, tarana, is, a, persian, word, meaning, a, song, tillana, is, a, corrupt, form, of, this, word, true, khusrau, had, before, him, the, example, of, nirgit, songs, using, u, k, ak, aras, meaningless, words, and, p, ak, aras, mnemonic, syllables, of, the, mridang, such, songs, were, in, vogue, at, least, from, the, time, of, bharat, but, generally, speaking, the, nirgit, used, hard, consonants, khusrau, introduced, two, innovations, in, this, form, of, vocal, music, firstly, he, introduced, mostly, persian, words, with, soft, consonants, secondly, he, so, arranged, these, words, that, they, bore, some, sense, he, also, introduced, a, few, hindi, words, to, complete, the, sense, it, was, only, khusrau, s, genius, that, could, arrange, these, words, in, such, a, way, to, yield, some, meaning, composers, after, him, could, not, succeed, in, doing, so, and, the, tarana, became, as, meaningless, as, the, ancient, nirgit, it, is, believed, that, khusrau, invented, the, tarana, style, during, his, attempt, to, reproduce, gopal, naik, s, exposition, in, raag, kadambak, khusrau, hid, and, listened, to, gopal, naik, for, six, days, and, on, the, seventh, day, he, reproduced, naik, s, rendition, using, meaningless, words, mridang, bols, thus, creating, the, tarana, style, khusrau, is, credited, for, the, invention, of, the, sitar, at, the, time, there, were, many, versions, of, the, veena, in, india, he, modified, the, three, stringed, tritantri, veena, as, a, setar, persian, for, 3, stringed, which, eventually, became, known, as, the, sitar, amir,

which, have, become, a, part, of, popular, culture, in, south, asia, his, riddles, are, one, of, the, most, popular, forms, of, hindavi, poetry, today, it, is, a, genre, that, involves, double, entendre, or, wordplay, innumerable, riddles, by, the, poet, have, been, passed, through, oral, tradition, over, the, last, seven, centuries, through, his, literary, output, khusrau, represents, one, of, the, first, recorded, indian, personages, with, a, true, multicultural, or, pluralistic, identity, musicians, credit, khusrau, with, the, creation, of, six, styles, of, music, qaul, qalbana, naqsh, gul, tarana, and, khyal, but, there, is, insufficient, evidence, for, this, khusrau, wrote, primarily, in, persian, many, hindustani, or, hindi, urdu, verses, are, attributed, to, him, since, there, is, no, evidence, for, their, composition, by, khusrau, before, the, 18th, century, the, language, of, the, hindustani, verses, appears, to, be, relatively, modern, he, used, the, term,
