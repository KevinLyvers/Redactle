had, never, heard, left, them, mildly, stupefied, yet, there, was, no, backlash, no, resentment, at, these, breathless, marathons, because, berlin, s, essential, modesty, and, good, manners, eliminated, jealousy, and, disarmed, hostility, after, leaving, st, paul, s, berlin, applied, to, balliol, college, oxford, but, was, denied, admission, after, a, chaotic, interview, berlin, decided,

a, prodigiously, energetic, capacity, for, enjoyment, of, life, of, people, in, all, their, variety, of, their, ideas, and, idiosyncrasies, of, literature, of, music, of, art, the, same, publication, reported, isaiah, berlin, was, often, described, especially, in, his, old, age, by, means, of, superlatives, the, world, s, greatest, talker, the, century, s, most, inspired, reader, one, of, the, finest, minds, of, our, time, there, is, no, doubt, that, he, showed, in, more, than, one, direction, the, unexpectedly, large, possibilities, open, to, us, at, the, top, end, of, the, range, of, human, potential, the, front, page, of, the, new, york, times, concluded, his, was, an, exuberant, life, crowded, with, joys, the, joy, of, thought, the, joy, of, music, the, joy, of, good, friends, the, theme, that, runs, throughout, his, work, is, his, concern, with, liberty, and, the, dignity, of, human, beings, sir, isaiah, radiated, well, being, isaiah, berlin, s, nephew, is, efraim, halevy,

lord, and, socrates, he, does, not, publish, much, he, thinks, and, says, a, great, deal, and, has, had, an, enormous, influence, on, our, times, maurice, bowra, on, isaiah, berlin, s, publishing, record, berlin, did, not, enjoy, writing, and, his, published, work, including, both, his, essays, and, books, was, produced, through, dictation, to, a, tape, recorder, or, by, the, transcription, of, his, improvised, lectures, and, talks, from, recorded, tapes, the, work, of, transcribing, his, spoken, word, often, placed, a, strain, on, his, secretaries, this, reliance, on, dictation, extended, to, his, letters, which, were, recorded, on, a, grundig, tape, recorder, he, would, often, dictate, these, letters, while, simultaneously, conversing, with, friends, and, his, secretary, would, then, transcribe, them, at, times, the, secretary, would, inadvertently, include, the, author, s, jokes, and, laughter, in, the, transcribed, text, the, product, of, this, unique, methodology, was, a, writing, style, that, mimicked, his, spoken, discourse, animated, quick, and, constantly, jumping, from, one, idea, to, another, his, everyday, conversation, was, literally, mirrored, in, his, works, complete, with, intricate, grammar, and, punctuation, berlin, is, known, for, his, inaugural, lecture, two, concepts, of, liberty, delivered, in, 1958, as, chichele, professor, of, social, and, political, theory, at, oxford, the, lecture, later, published, as, an, essay, reintroduced, the, study, of, political, philosophy, to, the, methods, of, analytic, philosophy, berlin, defined, negative, liberty, as, absence, of, coercion, or, interference, in, private, actions, by, an, external, political, body, which, berlin, derived, from, the, hobbesian, definition, of, liberty, positive, liberty, berlin, maintained, could, be, thought, of, as, self, mastery, which, asks, not, what, we, are, free, from, but, what, we, are, free, to, do, berlin, contended, that, modern, political, thinkers, often, conflated, positive, liberty, with, rational, action, based, upon, a, rational, knowledge, to, which, it, is, argued, only, a, certain, elite, or, social, group, has, access, this, rationalist, conflation, was, open, to, political, abuses, which, encroached, on, negative, liberty, when, such, interpretations, of, positive, liberty, were, in, the, nineteenth, century, used, to, defend, nationalism, paternalism, social, engineering, historicism, and, collective, rational, control, over, human, destiny, berlin, s, lectures, on, the, enlightenment, and, its, critics, especially, giambattista, vico, johann, gottfried, herder, joseph, de, maistre, and, johann, georg, hamann, to, whose, views, berlin, referred, as, the, counter, enlightenment, contributed, to, his, advocacy, of, an, irreducibly, pluralist, ethical, ontology, in, three, critics, of, the, enlightenment, berlin, argues, that, hamann, was, one, of, the, first, thinkers, to, conceive, of, human, cognition, as, language, the, articulation, and, use, of, symbols, berlin, saw, hamann, as, having, recognised, as, the, rationalist, s, cartesian, fallacy, the, notion, that, there, are, clear, and, distinct, ideas, which, can, be, contemplated, by, a, kind, of, inner, eye, without, the, use, of, language, a, recognition, greatly, sharpened, in, the, 20th, century, by, wittgenstein, s, private, language, argument, for, berlin, values, are, creations, of, mankind, rather, than, products, of, nature, waiting, to, be, discovered, he, argued, on, the, basis, of, the, epistemic, and, empathetic, access, we, have, to, other, cultures, across, history, that, the, nature, of, mankind, is, such, that, certain, values, the, importance, of, individual, liberty, for, instance, will, hold, true, across, cultures, and, this, is, what, he, meant, by, objective, pluralism, berlin, s, argument, was, partly, grounded, in, wittgenstein, s, later, theory, of, language, which, argued, that, inter, translatability, was, supervenient, on, a, similarity, in, forms, of, life, with, the, inverse, implication, that, our, epistemic, access, to, other, cultures, entails, an, ontologically, contiguous, value, structure, with, his, account, of, value, pluralism, he, proposed, the, view, that, moral, values, may, be, equally, or, rather, incommensurably, valid, and, yet, incompatible, and, may, therefore, come, into, conflict, with, one, another, in, a, way, that, admits, of, no, resolution, without, reference, to, particular, contexts, of, a, decision, when, values, clash, it, may, not, be, that, one, is, more, important, than, the, other, keeping, a, promise, may, conflict, with, the, pursuit, of, truth, liberty, may, clash, with, social, justice, moral, conflicts, are, an, intrinsic, irremovable, element, in, human, life, these, collisions, of, values, are, of, the, essence, of, what, they, are, and, what, we, are, for, berlin, this, clashing, of, incommensurate, values, within, no, less, than, between, individuals, constitutes, the, tragedy, of, human, life, alan, brown, suggests, however, that, berlin, ignores, the, fact, that, values, are, commensurable, in, the, extent, to, which, they, contribute, to, the, human, good, the, hedgehog, and, the, fox, a, title, referring, to, a, fragment, of, the, ancient, greek, poet, archilochus, was, one, of, berlin, s, most, popular, essays, with, the, general, public, reprinted, in, numerous, editions, of, the, classification, that, gives, the, essay, its, title, berlin, once, said, i, never, meant, it, very, seriously, i, meant, it, as, a, kind, of, enjoyable, intellectual, game, but, it, was, taken, seriously, berlin, expands, upon, this, idea, to, divide, writers, and, thinkers, into, two, categories, hedgehogs, who, view, the, world, through, the, lens, of, a, single, defining, idea, examples, given, include, plato, and, foxes, who, draw, on, a, wide, variety, of, experiences, and, for, whom, the, world, cannot, be, boiled, down, to, a, single, idea, examples, given, include, aristotle, berlin, promoted, the, notion, of, positive, liberty, in, the, sense, of, an, intrinsic, link, between, positive, freedom, and, participatory, athenian, style, democracy, there, is, a, contrast, with, negative, liberty, liberals, in, the, english, speaking, tradition, call, for, negative, liberty, meaning, a, realm, of, private, autonomy, from, which, the, state, is, legally, excluded, in, contrast, french, liberals, ever, since, the, french, revolution, more, often, promote, positive, liberty, that, is, liberty, insofar, as, it, is, tethered, to, collectively, defined, ends, they, praise, the, state, as, an, essential, tool, to, emancipate, the, people, berlin, s, lecture, historical, inevitability, 1954, focused, on, a, controversy, in, the, philosophy, of, history, given, the, choice, whether, one, believes, that, the, lives, of, entire, peoples, and, societies, have, been, decisively, influenced, by, exceptional, individuals, or, conversely, that, whatever, happens, occurs, as, a, result, of, impersonal, forces, oblivious, to, human, intentions, berlin, rejected, both, options, and, the, choice, itself, as, nonsensical, berlin, is, also, well, known, for, his, writings, on, russian, intellectual, history, most, of, which, are, collected, in, russian, thinkers, 1978, 2nd, ed, 2008, and, edited, as, most, of, berlin, s, work, by, henry, hardy, in, the, case, of, this, volume, jointly, with, aileen, kelly, berlin, also, contributed, a, number, of, essays, on, leading, intellectuals, and, political, figures, of, his, time, including, winston, churchill, franklin, delano, roosevelt, and, chaim, weizmann, eighteen, of, these, character, sketches, were,
