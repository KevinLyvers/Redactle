the, best, known, description, of, the, doctrines, of, the, english, common, law, born, into, a, middle, class, family, in, london, blackstone, was, educated, at, charterhouse, school, before, matriculating, at, pembroke, college, oxford, in, 1738, after, switching, to, and, completing, a, bachelor, of, civil, law, degree, he, was, made, a, fellow, of, all, souls, college, oxford, on, 2, november, 1743, admitted, to, middle, temple, and, called, to, the, bar, there, in, 1746, following, a, slow, start, to, his, career, as, a, barrister, blackstone, became, heavily, involved, in, university, administration, becoming, accountant, treasurer, and, bursar, on, 28, november, 1746, and, senior, bursar, in, 1750, blackstone, is, considered, responsible, for, completing, the, codrington, library, and, warton, building, and, simplifying, the, complex, accounting, system, used, by, the, college, on, 3, july, 1753, he, formally, gave, up, his, practice, as, a, barrister, and, instead, embarked, on, a, series, of, lectures, on, english, law, the, first, of, their, kind, these, were, massively, successful, earning, him, a, total, of, 453, 89, 000, in, 2023, terms, and, led, to, the, publication, of, an, analysis, of, the, laws, of, england, in, 1756, which, repeatedly, sold, out, and, was, used, to, preface, his, later, works, on, 20, october, 1759, blackstone, was, confirmed, as, the, first, vinerian, professor, of, english, law, immediately, embarking, on, another, series, of, lectures, and, publishing, a, similarly, successful, second, treatise, titled, a, discourse, on, the, study, of, the, law, with, his, growing, fame, he, successfully, returned, to, the, bar, and, maintained, a, good, practice, also, securing, election, as, tory, member, of, parliament, for, the, rotten, borough, of, hindon, on, 30, march, 1761, in, november, 1765, he, published, the, first, of, four, volumes, of, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, considered, his, magnum, opus, the, completed, work, earned, blackstone, 14, 000, 2, 459, 000, in, 2023, terms, after, repeated, failures, he, successfully, gained, appointment, to, the, judiciary, as, a, justice, of, the, court, of, king, s, bench, on, 16, february, 1770, leaving, to, replace, edward, clive, as, a, justice, of, the, common, pleas, on, 25, june, he, remained, in, this, position, until, his, death, on, 14, february, 1780, blackstone, s, four, volume, commentaries, were, designed, to, provide, a, complete, overview, of, english, law, and, were, repeatedly, republished, in, 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778, and, in, a, posthumous, edition, in, 1783, reprints, of, the, first, edition, intended, for, practical, use, rather, than, antiquary, interest, were, published, until, the, 1870s, in, england, and, wales, and, a, working, version, by, henry, john, stephen, first, published, in, 1841, was, reprinted, until, after, the, second, world, war, legal, education, in, england, had, stalled, blackstone, s, work, gave, the, law, at, least, a, veneer, of, scholarly, respectability, william, searle, holdsworth, one, of, blackstone, s, successors, as, vinerian, professor, argued, that, if, the, commentaries, had, not, been, written, when, they, were, written, i, think, it, very, doubtful, that, the, united, states, and, other, english, speaking, countries, would, have, so, universally, adopted, the, common, law, in, the, united, states, the, commentaries, influenced, alexander, hamilton, john, marshall, james, wilson, john, jay, john, adams, james, kent, and, abraham, lincoln, and, remain, frequently, cited, in, supreme, court, decisions, blackstone, was, the, fourth, and, posthumous, son, of, charles, blackstone, a, silk, mercer, from, cheapside, the, son, of, a, wealthy, apothecary, he, became, firm, friends, with, thomas, bigg, a, surgeon, and, the, son, of, lovelace, bigg, a, gentleman, from, wiltshire, after, bigg, s, sister, mary, came, to, london, charles, eventually, persuaded, her, to, marry, him, in, 1718, this, was, not, seen, as, a, good, match, for, her, but, the, couple, lived, happily, and, had, four, sons, three, of, whom, lived, into, adulthood, charles, born, august, 1719, and, henry, may, 1722, both, became, fellows, of, new, college, oxford, and, took, holy, orders, their, last, son, william, was, born, on, 10, july, 1723, five, months, after, charles, death, in, february, although, charles, and, mary, blackstone, were, members, of, the, middle, class, rather, than, landed, gentry, they, were, particularly, prosperous, tax, records, show, charles, blackstone, to, have, been, the, second, most, prosperous, man, in, the, parish, in, 1722, and, death, registers, show, that, the, family, had, several, servants, this, along, with, thomas, bigg, s, assistance, to, the, family, following, charles, death, helps, explain, the, educational, upbringing, of, the, children, william, blackstone, was, sent, to, charterhouse, school, in, 1730, having, been, nominated, by, charles, wither, a, relative, of, mary, blackstone, william, did, well, there, and, became, head, of, the, school, by, age, 15, however, after, charles, death, the, family, fortunes, declined, and, after, mary, died, 5, january, 1736, the, family, s, resources, largely, went, to, meet, unpaid, bills, william, was, able, to, remain, at, charterhouse, as, a, poor, scholar, having, been, named, to, that, position, in, june, 1735, after, being, nominated, by, sir, robert, walpole, blackstone, revelled, in, charterhouse, s, academic, curriculum, particularly, the, latin, poetry, of, ovid, and, virgil, he, began, to, attract, note, as, a, poet, at, school, writing, a, 30, line, set, of, rhyming, couplets, to, celebrate, the, wedding, of, james, hotchkis, the, headmaster, he, also, won, a, silver, medal, for, his, latin, verses, on, john, milton, gave, the, annual, latin, oration, in, 1738, and, was, noted, as, having, been, the, favourite, student, of, his, masters, on, 1, october, 1738, taking, advantage, of, a, new, scholarship, available, to, charterhouse, students, blackstone, matriculated, at, pembroke, college, oxford, there, are, few, surviving, records, of, blackstone, s, undergraduate, term, at, oxford, but, the, curriculum, of, pembroke, college, had, been, set, out, in, 1624, and, prest, notes, that, it, was, probably, still, followed, in, 1738, so, blackstone, would, have, studied, greek, science, logic, rhetoric, philosophy, mathematics, geography, and, poetry, blackstone, was, particularly, good, at, greek, mathematics, and, poetry, with, his, notes, on, william, shakespeare, being, included, in, george, steevens, 1781, edition, of, shakespeare, s, plays, many, of, blackstone, s, undergraduate, texts, survive, and, they, include, few, legal, texts, instead, being, wide, ranging, politics, current, affairs, poetry, geometry, and, controversial, theological, texts, the, last, element, is, understandable, given, his, family, s, theological, interests, but, the, more, surprising, element, is, the, sheer, number, of, texts, he, owned, given, his, relative, poverty, as, a, student, on, 9, july, 1740, after, only, a, year, and, a, half, as, a, bachelor, of, arts, student, blackstone, was, admitted, to, study, for, a, bachelor, of, civil, law, degree, civil, law, being, the, only, legal, area, recognised, by, his, university, this, degree, course, was, seven, years, long, the, first, two, supposedly, devoted, to, a, broad, course, of, reading, in, humane, studies, which, allowed, him, to, study, his, own, interests, on, 20, november, 1741, he, was, admitted, to, the, middle, temple, the, first, step, on, the, road, to, becoming, a, barrister, but, this, imposed, no, obligations, and, simply, allowed, a, legal, career, to, be, an, option, at, the, time, there, was, no, proper, legal, education, system, and, blackstone, read, in, his, own, time, coke, on, littleton, the, works, of, henry, finch, and, related, legal, tracts, in, addition, to, his, formal, studies, blackstone, published, a, collection, of, poetry, which, included, the, draft, version, of, the, lawyer, to, his, muse, his, most, famous, literary, work, in, 1743, he, published, elements, of, architecture, and, an, abridgement, of, architecture, two, treatises, on, the, rules, governing, the, art, of, construction, his, next, work, 1747, was, the, pantheon, a, vision, an, anonymously, published, book, of, poetry, covering, the, various, religions, in, the, world, it, depicts, a, narrator, s, walking, dream, through, the, buildings, of, various, religions, which, are, all, other, than, christianity, depicted, in, a, negative, light, this, followed, his, election, as, a, fellow, of, all, souls, college, oxford, on, 2, november, 1743, and, his, call, to, the, bar, by, the, middle, temple, on, 28, november, 1746, his, call, to, the, bar, saw, blackstone, begin, to, alternate, between, oxford, and, london, occupying, chambers, in, pump, court, but, living, at, all, souls, college, as, the, central, courts, only, sat, for, three, months, of, the, year, the, rest, of, his, time, was, spent, on, assize, when, his, work, at, all, souls, permitted, he, regularly, acted, as, a, law, reporter, his, personal, notes, on, cases, start, with, hankey, v, trotman, 1746, blackstone, s, barrister, practice, began, slowly, his, first, case, in, the, court, of, king, s, bench, was, in, 1748, and, he, had, only, 6, additional, motions, there, through, 1751, two, appearances, in, the, court, of, chancery, are, also, noted, and, he, is, known, to, have, been, consulted, in, roger, newdigate, s, long, running, lawsuit, there, but, his, early, court, appearances, are, infrequent, this, is, considered, to, have, been, due, to, his, call, to, the, bar, occurring, at, the, same, time, as, the, massive, contraction, in, business, by, the, central, courts, along, with, his, singular, lack, of, connections, due, to, his, status, as, an, orphan, from, the, middle, class, he, was, described, as, unrecognised, and, unemployed, he, filled, his, time, by, acting, as, counsel, for, oxford, and, from, may, 1749, with, his, election, as, recorder, of, wallingford, while, dividing, his, time, blackstone, became, an, administrator, at, all, souls, securing, appointment, as, accountant, treasurer, and, bursar, on, 28, november, 1746, completion, of, the, codrington, library, and, warton, building, first, started, in, 1710, and, 1720, respectively, but, not, built, until, 1748, is, attributed, to, his, work, in, 1749, he, became, steward, of, the, manors, and, in, 1750, was, made, senior, bursar, records, show, a, perfectionist, zeal, in, organising, the, estates, and, finances, of, all, souls, and, blackstone, was, noted, for, massively, simplifying, the, complex, accounting, system, used, by, the, college, in, 1750, blackstone, completed, his, first, legal, tract, an, essay, on, collateral, consanguinity, which, dealt, with, those, claiming, a, familial, tie, to, the, founder, or, all, souls, in, an, attempt, to, gain, preeminence, in, elections, completion, of, his, doctor, of, civil, law, degree, which, he, was, awarded, in, april, 1750, admitted, him, to, convocation, the, governing, body, of, oxford, which, elected, the, two, burgesses, who, represented, it, in, the, house, of, commons, along, with, most, of, the, university, officers, with, this, and, with, his, continuing, work, at, the, university, blackstone, announced, on, 3, july, 1753, his, intentions, to, no, longer, attend, the, courts, at, westminster, but, to, pursue, my, profession, in, a, way, more, agreeable, to, me, in, all, respects, by, residing, at, oxford, to, engraft, upon, this, resolution, a, scheme, which, i, am, told, may, be, beneficial, to, the, university, as, well, as, myself, which, was, to, give, a, set, of, lectures, on, the, common, law, the, first, lectures, of, that, sort, in, the, world, this, was, not, entirely, out, of, benevolence, according, to, prest, blackstone, was, likely, aware, that, an, oxford, alumnus, charles, viner, was, planning, to, endow, a, professorship, of, english, law, the, regius, professorship, of, civil, law, had, also, become, vacant, in, 1753, despite, support, from, lord, mansfield, blackstone, had, been, rejected, in, favour, of, robert, jenner, widely, considered, blackstone, s, lesser, intellectually, but, a, far, greater, political, mind, in, addition, a, private, lecture, series, would, be, extremely, lucrative, while, his, all, souls, fellowship, gave, him, 70, a, year, records, show, that, the, lecture, series, brought, him, 116, 226, and, 111, a, year, respectively, from, 1753, to, 1755, a, total, of, 453, 89, 000, in, 2023, terms, a, prospectus, was, issued, on, 23, june, 1753, and, with, a, class, of, approximately, 20, students, the, first, set, of, lectures, were, completed, by, july, 1754, despite, blackstone, s, limited, oratory, skills, and, a, speaking, style, described, by, jeremy, bentham, as, formal, precise, and, affected, blackstone, s, lectures, were, warmly, appreciated, the, second, and, third, series, were, far, more, popular, partly, due, to, the, then, unusual, use, of, printed, handouts, and, lists, of, suggested, reading, no, copies, of, these, handouts, exist, but, alexander, popham, later, a, close, friend, of, blackstone, attended, the, lectures, and, made, notes, which, survive, these, show, blackstone, s, attempts, to, reduce, english, law, to, a, logical, system, with, the, division, of, subjects, later, being, the, basis, for, his, commentaries, following, his, lecture, series, blackstone, became, more, prominent, in, convocation, and, other, university, activities, oxford, and, cambridge, at, the, time, had, a, strange, system, of, law, due, to, their, unique, natures, they, had, exclusive, jurisdiction, over, both, academics, and, students, in, a, fashion, which, followed, either, the, common, law, or, their, own, customs, based, on, the, civil, law, with, his, appointment, as, assessor, or, chief, legal, officer, of, the, chancellor, s, court, blackstone, became, far, more, involved, in, the, university, s, peculiar, legal, system, and, records, show, him, sitting, between, eight, and, ten, times, a, year, from, 1753, to, 1759, mainly, dealing, with, small, claims, of, debt, he, also, wrote, a, manual, on, the, court, s, practice, and, through, his, position, gained, a, large, number, of, contacts, and, connections, as, well, as, visibility, which, aided, his, legal, career, significantly, this, period, also, saw, blackstone, write, his, last, known, piece, of, poetry, friendship, an, ode, in, 1756, in, 1756, blackstone, published, the, first, of, his, full, legal, texts, the, 200, page, an, analysis, of, the, laws, of, england, published, by, the, clarendon, press, the, treatise, was, intended, to, demonstrate, the, order, and, principal, divisions, of, his, lecture, series, and, a, structured, introduction, to, english, law, prest, calls, this, a, marked, advance, on, any, previous, introduction, to, english, law, including, constitutional, civil, and, criminal, law, public, and, private, law, substantive, law, and, procedure, as, well, as, some, introductory, jurisprudential, content, the, initial, print, run, of, 1, 000, copies, almost, immediately, sold, out, leading, to, the, printing, of, three, more, 1, 000, book, lots, over, the, next, three, years, which, all, sold, out, a, fifth, edition, was, published, in, 1762, and, a, sixth, edited, to, take, into, account, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, in, 1771, because, of, the, success, of, the, commentaries, prest, remarks, that, relatively, little, scholarly, attention, has, been, paid, to, this, work, at, the, time, however, it, was, hailed, as, an, elegant, performance, calculated, to, facilitate, this, branch, of, knowledge, on, 8, march, 1758, the, group, executing, charles, viner, s, will, reported, to, convocation, that, viner, recommended, creating, a, chair, of, english, law, with, a, 200, salary, after, much, debate, this, position, was, created, and, on, 20, october, 1758, blackstone, was, confirmed, as, the, first, vinerian, professor, of, english, law, on, 24, october, he, gave, his, first, lecture, to, a, crowded, audience, the, text, was, soon, printed, and, published, as, a, discourse, on, the, study, of, the, law, the, lecture, was, tremendously, popular, being, described, as, a, sensible, spirited, and, manly, exhortation, to, the, study, of, the, law, the, initial, print, run, sold, out, necessitating, the, publication, of, another, 1, 000, copies, and, it, was, used, to, preface, later, versions, of, the, analysis, and, the, first, volume, of, the, commentaries, within, the, university, however, blackstone, was, not, as, popular, as, soon, as, the, lecture, series, opened, an, anonymously, written, open, letter, was, published, charging, that, blackstone, had, violated, the, statutes, of, the, university, by, arbitrarily, changing, the, day, appointed, for, reading, his, solemn, lectures, blackstone, suffered, a, nervous, breakdown, soon, after, the, first, lecture, and, on, 24, november, he, launched, a, suit, in, the, chancellor, s, court, against, william, jackson, of, the, city, of, oxford, printer, for, 500, damages, justified, by, jackson, printing, and, publishing, a, scandalous, libell, notoriously, reflecting, on, the, character, of, him, the, said, william, blackstone, jackson, had, refused, to, reveal, who, ordered, the, anonymous, pamphlet, leading, to, the, suit, but, it, evidently, did, not, proceed, further, this, suit, along, with, the, struggle, over, the, vinerian, professorship, and, other, controversies, damaged, his, reputation, within, the, university, as, evidenced, by, his, failure, to, win, election, as, vice, warden, in, april, 1759, losing, to, john, white, prest, attributes, blackstone, s, unpopularity, to, specific, personality, traits, saying, his, determination, in, pursuit, of, causes, to, which, he, committed, himself, could, irritate, as, well, as, intimidate, those, of, a, more, relaxed, disposition, while, quick, to, take, offence, at, perceived, slights, on, his, own, character, and, motives, he, could, also, show, surprising, indifference, to, the, effect, his, words, and, actions, might, have, on, others, this, marked, the, beginning, of, his, break, with, oxford, which, coincided, with, his, growing, influence, outside, the, university, in, 1759, lord, bute, prince, george, s, official, tutor, requested, copies, of, blackstone, s, lectures, which, he, forwarded, later, that, year, blackstone, was, paid, 200, by, the, prince, who, became, an, appreciative, loyal, and, soon, to, be, incomparably, influential, patron, this, patronage, and, blackstone, s, purchase, of, a, set, of, chambers, in, the, inner, temple, also, transferring, to, that, inn, were, significant, steps, in, his, departure, from, oxford, in, 1759, blackstone, published, another, two, works, the, great, charter, and, the, charter, of, the, forest, with, other, authentic, instruments, described, as, a, major, piece, of, pioneering, scholarship, leading, to, blackstone, s, election, to, the, society, of, antiquaries, in, february, 1761, and, a, treatise, on, the, law, of, descents, in, fee, simple, which, was, later, used, almost, verbatim, as, chapters, 14, and, 15, of, the, commentaries, with, sponsorship, from, the, prince, of, wales, and, his, success, with, the, analysis, blackstone, began, work, as, a, barrister, although, he, kept, up, his, lecture, series, at, oxford, by, 1760, he, had, become, a, very, eminent, figure, indeed, in, the, world, of, letters, and, his, legal, practice, grew, as, a, result, although, not, considered, a, great, barrister, of, the, period, he, maintained, a, steady, flow, of, cases, primarily, in, the, king, s, bench, and, exchequer, of, pleas, on, the, death, of, the, third, earl, of, abingdon, blackstone, was, retained, as, counsel, for, the, executors, and, trustees, to, oversee, the, family, s, attempts, to, pay, off, debts, and, meet, other, obligations, on, 5, may, 1761, he, married, sarah, clitherow, a, member, of, a, family, of, lesser, gentry, from, middlesex, their, first, child, william, bertie, blackstone, born, 21, august, 1762, did, not, survive, to, adulthood, seven, more, children, were, born, henry, james, sarah, mary, philippa, william, charles, and, george, who, also, died, in, childhood, the, blackstones, had, a, large, estate, in, wallingford, in, berkshire, including, 120, acres, 46, ha, of, pastureland, around, the, river, thames, and, the, right, of, advowson, over, st, peter, s, church, in, february, 1761, blackstone, was, considered, as, a, potential, tory, candidate, for, the, rotten, borough, of, hindon, in, wiltshire, after, consultation, with, friends, he, agreed, to, this, prospect, at, the, same, time, refusing, the, offer, of, appointment, as, lord, chief, justice, of, ireland, on, 30, march, 1761, he, was, returned, for, hindon, and, took, his, seat, this, did, not, limit, his, legal, work, initially, with, the, seat, being, given, without, a, requirement, to, attend, or, vote, in, a, particular, way, and, the, grant, of, a, patent, of, precedence, at, the, same, time, actually, increased, the, demand, on, his, time, court, records, show, him, pleading, before, lord, mansfield, in, the, court, of, king, s, bench, soon, after, his, election, and, acting, as, counsel, in, tonson, v, collins, a, copyright, case, thiquet, v, bath, an, important, case, on, international, law, and, r, v, d, eon, acting, for, the, prosecution, in, a, feud, over, louis, xv, s, newly, appointed, cross, dressing, ambassador, to, the, united, kingdom, with, this, increase, in, his, practice, blackstone, also, saw, an, increase, in, his, out, of, court, work, writing, opinions, and, recommendations, for, various, oxford, colleges, the, mp, jonathan, rashleigh, and, the, fourth, earl, of, abingdon, who, paid, him, to, draft, several, private, acts, of, parliament, in, december, 1761, he, asked, lord, shelburne, a, patron, for, his, assistance, in, gaining, appointment, as, chief, justice, of, chester, writing, again, in, july, 1762, to, prevail, upon, lord, bute, to, recommend, me, to, his, majesty, s, notice, anticipating, an, upcoming, vacancy, in, the, court, of, common, pleas, parliamentary, service, was, considered, a, desirable, if, never, absolutely, essential, qualification, for, would, be, english, judges, something, that, did, not, necessarily, bode, well, for, blackstone, naturally, inarticulate, and, reticent, he, was, an, infrequent, and, indifferent, speaker, during, his, first, session, of, parliament, speaking, only, 14, times, in, seven, years, his, chosen, career, did, lend, him, to, politics, in, that, the, lawyers, in, the, house, of, commons, were, often, added, to, select, committees, to, provide, them, with, technical, expertise, in, drafting, legislation, he, again, applied, for, a, judicial, post, in, december, 1762, after, an, opening, in, the, exchequer, of, pleas, came, up, but, lost, to, george, perrott, a, leading, exchequer, barrister, the, next, five, vacancies, also, failed, to, go, to, blackstone, after, the, appointment, of, lord, camden, a, whig, as, lord, chancellor, in, 1765, blackstone, announced, his, resignation, from, the, vinerian, chair, effective, after, his, 1766, lectures, these, were, divided, into, two, 14, lecture, series, on, private, wrongs, and, public, wrongs, delivered, between, 12, february, and, 24, april, at, this, point, blackstone, had, published, nothing, new, since, a, treatise, on, the, law, of, descents, in, fee, simple, in, 1759, the, decision, to, resign, was, most, likely, due, to, the, increasing, demands, of, his, legal, practice, and, the, reduced, profit, from, the, lectures, which, after, peaking, at, 340, in, 1762, dropped, to, 239, a, year, later, and, to, 203, for, the, final, round, of, lectures, in, 1765, 6, in, response, blackstone, decided, to, publish, a, new, book, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, the, first, volume, was, published, in, november, 1765, bringing, the, author, 1, 600, the, full, work, would, eventually, bring, in, over, 14, 000, owen, ruffhead, described, volume, i, as, masterly, noting, that, mr, blackstone, is, perhaps, the, first, who, has, treated, the, body, of, the, law, in, a, liberal, elegant, and, constitutional, manner, a, vein, of, good, sense, and, moderation, runs, through, every, page, every, copy, was, sold, within, six, months, and, the, second, and, third, volumes, published, in, october, 1766, and, june, 1768, received, a, similar, reception, the, fourth, and, final, volume, appeared, in, 1769, dealing, with, criminal, law, with, the, financial, success, of, the, commentaries, blackstone, moved, in, 1768, from, his, london, property, in, carey, fields, to, no, 55, lincoln, s, inn, fields, neighbours, included, the, sardinian, ambassador, sir, walter, rawlinson, lord, northington, john, morton, and, the, third, earl, of, abingdon, making, it, an, appropriate, house, for, a, great, and, able, lawyer, blackstone, s, treatise, was, republished, in, 1770, 1773, 1774, 1775, 1778, and, in, a, posthumous, edition, in, 1783, reprints, of, the, first, edition, intended, for, practical, use, rather, than, antiquary, interest, were, published, until, the, 1870s, in, england, and, wales, and, a, working, version, by, henry, john, stephen, first, published, in, 1841, was, reprinted, until, after, the, second, world, war, the, first, american, edition, was, produced, in, 1772, prior, to, this, over, 1, 000, copies, had, already, been, sold, in, the, thirteen, colonies, even, after, the, publication, of, the, commentaries, blackstone, s, chances, of, judicial, appointment, remained, slim, while, he, was, old, enough, experienced, enough, and, widely, respected, the, presence, of, lord, camden, as, lord, chancellor, and, blackstone, s, lack, of, aristocratic, patrons, at, the, time, hindered, his, chances, in, january, 1770, however, lord, grafton, s, government, began, to, fall, with, camden, resigning, on, 17, january, and, solicitor, general, john, dunning, following, him, george, iii, appointed, lord, north, as, prime, minister, and, north, picked, charles, yorke, as, lord, chancellor, yorke, s, death, on, 20, january, after, holding, the, position, for, less, than, three, days, left, several, important, legal, positions, within, the, government, open, as, such, blackstone, now, mp, for, westbury, was, apparently, approached, to, become, solicitor, general, he, refused, not, wanting, to, deal, with, the, complicated, duties, attached, to, the, position, on, 9, february, 1770, apparently, with, the, intervention, of, the, king, and, possibly, lord, mansfield, blackstone, became, a, justice, of, the, common, pleas, succeeding, edward, clive, and, was, made, a, serjeant, at, law, on, 12, february, after, only, four, days, it, was, announced, that, joseph, yates, was, to, move, to, the, common, pleas, and, blackstone, was, again, sworn, in, as, a, judge, this, time, of, the, court, of, king, s, bench, this, was, apparently, due, to, yates, poor, health, lord, mansfield, ran, a, busy, court, as, lord, chief, justice, and, it, was, felt, that, his, transfer, to, the, common, pleas, was, for, the, best, others, commented, that, it, was, instead, due, to, political, and, judicial, disagreement, with, yates, unwilling, to, stomach, the, changes, which, mansfield, made, to, english, law, blackstone, sat, regularly, as, a, judge, despite, bouts, of, ill, health, and, also, served, on, various, circuit, courts, prest, describes, him, as, an, exceptionally, careful, conscientious, and, well, respected, judge, his, judgments, ranging, between, narrowly, framed, technicalities, broad, statements, of, public, commentary, he, was, however, considered, a, poor, trial, judge, being, reversed, on, appeal, more, frequently, than, any, of, his, peers, blackstone, returned, to, the, common, pleas, on, 25, june, 1770, having, spent, less, than, six, months, in, the, king, s, bench, jeremy, bentham, asserted, that, this, was, due, to, mansfield, s, having, blackstone, removed, similarly, to, his, removal, of, yates, bentham, asserted, that, in, the, king, s, bench, blackstone, was, always, in, hot, water, and, that, there, was, heartburning, between, the, two, bentham, s, account, is, considered, dubious, because, historically, mansfield, and, blackstone, had, an, excellent, relationship, with, the, third, volume, of, the, commentaries, describing, mansfield, as, a, judge, whose, masterly, acquaintance, with, the, law, of, nations, was, known, and, revered, by, every, state, in, europe, there, is, only, one, recorded, king, s, bench, case, r, v, proprietors, of, birmingham, canal, navigation, in, which, blackstone, and, mansfield, disagreed, in, the, common, pleas, blackstone, operated, under, a, civil, jurisdiction, rather, than, a, mixed, civil, and, criminal, one, this, played, to, his, strengths, and, many, of, his, decisions, are, considered, farsighted, the, principle, in, blaney, v, hendricks, for, example, that, interest, is, due, on, an, account, where, money, was, lent, which, anticipated, section, 3, of, the, law, reform, miscellaneous, provisions, act, 1934, blackstone, s, decision, in, goldswain, s, case, was, later, repeated, by, lord, denning, in, falmouth, boat, construction, co, v, howell, in, 1950, blackstone, had, long, suffered, from, gout, and, by, november, 1779, also, had, a, nervous, disorder, which, caused, dizziness, high, blood, pressure, and, possibly, diabetes, by, 3, february, 1780, he, was, too, weak, to, write, and, after, some, days, almost, totally, insensible, he, died, on, 14, february, at, age, 56, after, a, service, conducted, by, bishop, barrington, on, 22, february, blackstone, was, buried, in, the, family, vault, under, st, peter, s, church, wallingford, as, his, estate, at, his, death, was, worth, less, than, 15, 000, william, eden, secured, a, 400, annual, royal, pension, for, sarah, blackstone, the, initial, reaction, to, blackstone, s, death, was, subdued, but, in, december, 1780, the, fellows, of, all, souls, college, agreed, that, a, statue, be, erected, to, the, memory, of, sr, w, blackstone, deceased, constructed, by, john, bacon, the, life, sized, statue, of, blackstone, in, his, judicial, robes, cost, 539, and, has, rested, in, the, codrington, library, now, the, all, souls, college, library, since, 1872, his, brother, in, law, james, clitherow, also, published, in, 1781, two, volumes, of, his, law, reports, which, added, 1, 287, to, the, estate, and, in, 1782, the, biographical, history, of, sir, william, blackstone, appeared, blackstone, s, primary, legacy, is, his, written, work, specifically, the, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, in, england, and, america, the, commentaries, became, the, basis, of, university, legal, education, demand, for, reprinted, abridged, and, translated, versions, was, almost, inexhaustible, in, the, 18th, and, 19th, centuries, although, the, commentaries, emphasis, on, the, sovereignty, of, parliament, drew, ire, alexis, de, tocqueville, described, blackstone, as, an, inferior, writer, without, liberality, of, mind, or, depth, of, judgment, other, commentators, differ, one, described, him, as, the, core, element, in, the, british, enlightenment, comparing, him, to, montesquieu, beccaria, and, voltaire, academics, have, said, that, the, commentaries, were, crucial, in, changing, english, law, from, a, system, based, on, actions, to, a, system, of, substantive, law, at, the, time, of, publication, the, common, law, of, england, was, still, in, some, ways, in, its, infancy, with, people, uncertain, as, to, what, the, law, was, the, commentaries, helped, to, solidify, legal, thinking, at, the, same, time, legal, education, had, stalled, and, blackstone, s, work, gave, the, law, at, least, a, veneer, of, scholarly, respectability, william, searle, holdsworth, one, of, blackstone, s, successors, as, vinerian, professor, argued, that, if, the, commentaries, had, not, been, written, when, they, were, written, i, think, it, very, doubtful, that, and, other, english, speaking, countries, would, have, so, universally, adopted, the, law, the, commentaries, had, a, particular, influence, in, the, united, states, james, iredell, an, original, associate, justice, of, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, wrote, that, the, commentaries, were, books, admirably, calculated, for, a, young, student, and, indeed, may, instruct, the, most, learned, pleasure, and, instruction, go, hand, in, hand, when, the, commentaries, were, first, printed, in, north, america, 1, 400, copies, were, ordered, for, philadelphia, alone, academics, have, also, noted, the, early, reliance, of, the, supreme, court, on, the, commentaries, probably, due, to, a, lack, of, us, legal, tradition, at, that, time, the, us, academic, robert, ferguson, notes, that, all, our, formative, documents, the, declaration, of, independence, the, constitution, the, federalist, papers, and, the, seminal, decisions, of, the, supreme, court, under, john, marshall, were, drafted, by, attorneys, steeped, in, sir, william, blackstone, s, commentaries, on, the, laws, of, england, so, much, was, this, the, case, that, the, commentaries, rank, second, only, to, the, bible, as, a, literary, and, intellectual, influence, on, the, history, of, american, institutions, even, towards, the, end, of, the, twentieth, century, the, commentaries, were, cited, in, supreme, court, decisions, between, 10, and, 12, times, a, year, within, united, states, academia, and, practise, as, well, as, within, the, judiciary, the, commentaries, had, a, substantial, impact, with, the, scarcity, of, law, books, on, the, frontier, they, were, both, the, only, law, school, and, the, only, law, library, most, american, lawyers, used, to, practise, law, in, america, for, nearly, a, century, after, they, were, published, blackstone, had, drawn, up, a, plan, for, a, dedicated, school, of, law, and, submitted, it, to, the, university, of, oxford, when, the, idea, was, rejected, he, included, it, in, the, commentaries, it, is, from, this, plan, that, the, modern, system, of, american, law, schools, comes, subscribers, to, the, first, edition, of, blackstone, and, later, readers, who, were, profoundly, influenced, by, it, include, james, iredell, john, marshall, james, wilson, john, jay, john, adams, james, kent, and, abraham, lincoln, in, the, early, 1920s, the, american, bar, association, presented, a, statue, of, blackstone, to, the, english, bar, association, however, at, the, time, the, sculpture, was, too, tall, to, be, placed, in, the, royal, courts, of, justice, in, london, the, sculpture, designed, by, paul, wayland, bartlett, was, eventually, cast, in, europe, and, presented, back, to, the, us, for, display, congress, approved, the, placement, of, the, sculpture, in, washington, d, c, on, 15, march, 1943, and, appropriated, 10, 000, for, the, installation, the, bronze, statue, is, a, nine, foot, 2, 7, m, standing, portrait, of, blackstone, wearing, judicial, robes, and, a, long, curly, wig, holding, a, copy, of, commentaries, it, is, placed, on, a, tall, granite, base, and, stands, on, constitution, avenue, and, 3rd, street, nw, the, town, of, blackstone, virginia, is, named, after, him, the, north, wall, frieze, in, the, courtroom, of, the, supreme, court, of, the, united, states, depicts, william, blackstone, as, one, of, the, most, influential, legal, commentators, in, world, history, among, the, most, well, known, of, blackstone, s, contributions, to, judicial, theory, is, his, own, statement, of, the, principle, that, it, is, better, that, ten, guilty, persons, escape, than, that, one, innocent, suffer, while, this, argument, originates, at, least, as, far, back, as, genesis, 18, 23, 32, in, the, bible, as, well, as, versions, by, maimonides, and, sir, john, fortescue, blackstone, s, analysis, is, the, one, picked, up, by, benjamin, franklin, and, others, so, that, the, term, has, become, known, as, blackstone, s, ratio, as, john, adams, having, studied, blackstone, put, it, it, is, more, important, that, innocence, should, be, protected, than, it, is, that, guilt, be, punished, for, guilt, and, crimes, are, so, frequent, in, this, world, that, all, of, them, cannot, be, punished, when, innocence, itself, is, brought, to, the, bar, and, condemned, especially, to, die, the, subject, will, exclaim, it, is, immaterial, to, me, whether, i, behave, well, or, ill, for, virtue, itself, is, no, security, and, if, such, a, sentiment, as, this, were, to, take, hold, in, the, mind, of, the, subject, that, would, be, the, end, of, all, security, whatsoever, blackstone, s, ratio, is, a, maxim, of, english, law, having, been, established, as, such, within, a, few, decades, of, blackstone, s, work, being, published, it, is, also, cited, in, courts, and, law, in, the, us, and, is, strongly, emphasised, to, american, law, students, english, jurist, jeremy, bentham, was, a, critic, of, blackstone, s, theories, others, saw, blackstone, s, theories, as, inaccurate, statements, of, english, law, using, the, constitutions, of, clarendon, the, tractatus, of, glanville, and, the, 1689, bill, of, rights, as, particularly, obvious, examples, of, laws, blackstone,
