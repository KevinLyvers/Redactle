heroin, and, when, caserta, refused, to, provide, it, joplin, reportedly, admonished, her, by, saying, don, t, think, if, you, can, get, it, i, can, t, get, it, joplin, s, publicist, myra, friedman, was, unaware, during, joplin, s, lifetime, that, this, had, happened, later, while, friedman, was, working, on, her, book, buried, alive, she, determined, that, the, time, frame, of, the, joplin, caserta, encounter, was, one, week, before, jimi, hendrix, s, death, within, a, few, days, joplin, became, a, regular, customer, of, the, same, heroin, dealer, who, had, been, supplying, caserta,

used, heroin, during, the, many, long, distance, telephone, conversations, that, joplin, and, friedman, had, in, september, 1970, and, on, october, 1, joplin, never, mentioned, caserta, and, friedman, assumed, caserta, had, been, out, of, joplin, s, life, for, a, while, friedman, who, had, more, time, than, grossman, to, monitor, the, situation, never, visited, california, she, thought, joplin, sounded, on, the, phone, like, she, was, less, depressed, than, she, had, been, over, the, summer, when, joplin, was, not, at, sunset, sound, recorders, she, liked, to, drive, her, porsche, over, the,

saturday, she, learned, by, telephone, to, her, dismay, that, seth, morgan, had, met, other, women, at, a, marin, county, california, restaurant, invited, them, to, her, home, and, was, shooting, pool, with, them, using, her, pool, table, people, at, sunset, sound, recorders, overheard, joplin, expressing, anger, about, the, state, of, her, relationship, with, morgan, as, well, as, joy, about,

according, to, what, he, told, john, byrne, cooke, immediately, after, he, glotzer, learned, of, her, death, evidently, joplin, had, a, friendly, conversation, with, a, young, man, whom, she, did, not, know, and, he, expressed, admiration, for, her, music, after, midnight, she, drove, ken, pearson, and, the, male, fan, to, the, landmark, where, she, and, pearson, were, staying, in, separate, rooms, during, the, car, ride, the, fan, asked, joplin, questions, about, her, singing, style, according, to, friedman, and, she, mostly, ignored, him, so, she, could, converse, with, pearson, as, joplin, and, pearson, prepared, to, part, in, the, lobby, of, the, landmark, she, expressed, a, fear, possibly, in, jest, that, he, and, the, other, full, tilt, boogie, musicians, might, decide, to,

joplin, in, 1999, when, alice, echols, biography, scars, of, sweet, paradise, was, published, joplin, had, an, on, again, off, again, romantic, relationship, with, peggy, caserta, they, first, met, in, november, 1966, when, big, brother, performed, at, the, matrix, in, san, francisco, caserta, was, one, of, 15, people, in, the, audience, at, the, time, she, ran, mnasidika, a, clothing, boutique, in, the, haight, ashbury, approximately, a, month, after, the, concert, joplin, visited, caserta, s, boutique, and, said, she, could, not, afford, to, buy, a, pair, of, 5, jeans, for, sale, asking, to, make, a, 50, cent, down, payment, caserta, was, amazed, such, a, talented, singer, could, not, afford, 5, and, gave, joplin, a, pair, for, free, their, friendship, was, platonic, for, more, than, a, year, before, it, became, romantic, caserta, was, in, love, with, big, brother, guitarist, sam, andrew, and, sometime, during, the, first, half, of, 1968, traveled, from, san, francisco, to, new, york, to, be, with, him, he, did, not, want, a, serious, relationship, and, joplin, sympathized, with, caserta, s, disappointment, the, woodstock, concert, film, includes, 37, seconds, of, joplin, and, caserta, walking, together, before, they, reached, the, tent, where, joplin, waited, for, her, turn, to, perform, by, the, time, the, festival, took, place, in, august, 1969, both, were, intravenous, heroin, addicts, according, to, caserta, s, book, going, down, with, janis, which, caserta, has, since, disowned, joplin, introduced, her, to, her, boyfriend, seth, morgan, in, joplin, s, room, at, the, landmark, motor, hotel, on, september, 29, 1970, caserta, had, seen, him, around, in, san, francisco, but, had, not, met, him, at, some, point, an, agreement, was, made, for, a, threesome, to, take, place, the, following, friday, although, caserta, later, said, she, immediately, abandoned, the, idea, once, she, realized, it, was, morgan, who, would, be, with, joplin, morgan, made, alternate, plans, believing, caserta, would, be, with, joplin, that, evening, each, one, was, unaware, the, other, had, bowed, out, the, day, after, joplin, introduced, caserta, to, morgan, caserta, saw, joplin, briefly, when, caserta, accommodated, her, new, los, angeles, friend, 19, year, old, debbie, nuciforo, nuciforo, was, an, aspiring, rock, drummer, who, wanted, to, meet, joplin, and, was, high, on, heroin, at, the, time, the, meeting, of, the, three, women, was, reportedly, brief, and, unpleasant, caserta, suspected, the, reason, for, joplin, s, foul, mood, was, that, morgan, had, abandoned, her, earlier, that, day, after, having, spent, less, than, 24, hours, with, her, caserta, did, not, see, nor, communicate, by, phone, with, joplin, again, although, she, later, claimed, she, had, tried, to, reach, joplin, at, the, landmark, motor, hotel, and, sunset, sound, recorders, caserta, and, morgan, lost, touch, with, each, other, each, had, independently, made, plans, for, friday, october, 2, joplin, mentioned, her, disappointment, over, both, friends, bailing, out, of, their, m, nage, trois, to, her, drug, dealer, on, saturday, while, he, was, selling, her, the, dose, of, heroin, that, killed, her, as, caserta, later, learned, from, the, dealer, biographer, myra, friedman, commented, in, her, original, version, of, buried, alive, 1973, given, the, near, infinite, potentials, of, infancy, it, is, really, impossible, to, make, generalizations, about, what, lies, behind, sexual, practices, this, however, is, probable, to, become, clearly, homosexual, to, make, the, choice, that, one, honestly, prefers, relations, with, one, s, own, sex, no, matter, the, origins, of, such, preference, requires, a, certain, integration, a, stability, of, psychic, development, a, tidiness, of, personality, organization, the, ridicule, and, the, humiliation, that, took, place, at, that, most, delicate, period, in, early, teens, her, own, inability, to, surmount, the, obstacles, to, regular, growth, devastated, her, a, great, deal, more, than, most, people, comprehended, janis, was, not, heir, to, an, ego, so, cohesive, as, to, permit, her, an, identity, one, way, or, the, other, she, was, as, mr, giarritano, put, it, diffused, spewing, splattering, splaying, all, over, without, a, center, to, hold, that, had, as, much, to, do, with, her, original, use, of, drugs, as, did, the, critical, component, of, guilt, and, its, multiplicity, of, sources, above, and, beyond, the, contribution, made, by, her, relationships, with, women, were, she, so, simple, as, the, lesbians, wished, her, to, be, or, so, free, as, her, associates, imagined, kim, france, reported, in, her, may, 2, 1999, the, new, york, times, article, nothin, left, to, lose, once, she, became, famous, joplin, cursed, like, a, truck, driver, did, not, believe, in, wearing, undergarments, was, rarely, seen, without, her, bottle, of, southern, comfort, and, delighted, in, playing, the, role, of, sexual, predator, on, july, 11, 1970, joplin, made, a, revealing, statement, about, her, sexuality, to, her, friend, richard, hundgen, the, grateful, dead, s, san, francisco, based, road, manager, whom, she, had, known, since, 1966, when, joplin, and, hundgen, were, offstage, during, a, san, diego, gig, for, both, full, tilt, boogie, and, big, brother, and, the, holding, company, she, said, the, following, that, he, later, repeated, to, myra, friedman, i, hear, a, rumor, that, somebody, in, san, francisco, is, spreading, stories, that, i, m, a, dyke, you, go, back, there, and, find, out, who, it, is, and, tell, them, that, janis, says, she, s, gotten, it, on, with, a, couple, of, thousand, cats, in, her, life, and, a, few, hundred, chicks, and, see, what, they, can, do, with, that, on, sunday, evening, october, 4, 1970, joplin, was, found, dead, on, the, floor, of, her, room, at, the, landmark, motor, hotel, by, her, road, manager, and, close, friend, john, byrne, cooke, alcohol, was, present, in, the, room, newspapers, reported, that, no, other, drugs, or, paraphernalia, were, present, according, to, a, 1983, book, authored, by, joseph, dimona, and, los, angeles, county, coroner, thomas, noguchi, evidence, of, narcotics, was, removed, from, the, scene, by, a, friend, of, joplin, and, later, put, back, after, the, person, realized, that, an, autopsy, was, going, to, reveal, that, narcotics, were, in, her, system, the, book, adds, that, prior, to, joplin, s, death, noguchi, had, investigated, other, fatal, drug, overdoses, in, los, angeles, where, friends, believed, they, were, doing, favors, for, decedents, by, removing, evidence, of, narcotics, then, they, thought, things, over, and, returned, to, put, back, the, evidence, noguchi, performed, an, autopsy, on, joplin, and, determined, the, cause, of, death, to, be, a, heroin, overdose, possibly, compounded, by, alcohol, john, byrne, cooke, believed, joplin, had, gotten, heroin, much, more, potent, than, what, she, and, other, l, a, heroin, users, had, received, on, previous, occasions, as, was, indicated, by, overdoses, of, several, of, her, dealer, s, other, customers, during, the, same, weekend, her, death, was, ruled, accidental, both, peggy, caserta, joplin, s, close, friend, and, seth, morgan, joplin, s, fianc, failed, to, meet, joplin, on, oct, 2, the, friday, immediately, before, her, death, joplin, had, been, expecting, both, of, them, to, keep, her, company, that, night, according, to, caserta, joplin, was, saddened, neither, of, her, friends, came, to, the, landmark, as, promised, during, the, 24, hours, joplin, lived, after, this, disappointment, caserta, did, not, call, to, explain, why, she, failed, to, show, up, caserta, admitted, to, waiting, until, late, saturday, night, to, dial, the, landmark, motel, switchboard, only, to, learn, that, joplin, had, instructed, the, desk, clerk, not, to, accept, any, incoming, calls, for, her, after, midnight, morgan, did, speak, to, joplin, via, telephone, within, the, 24, hours, before, her, death, but, little, is, known, about, that, call, she, used, a, phone, at, sunset, sound, recorders, where, her, colleagues, there, were, perhaps, twenty, to, twenty, five, people, present, wrote, biographer, myra, friedman, noticed, that, whatever, morgan, said, to, her, made, her, very, angry, peggy, caserta, has, insisted, joplin, s, death, was, not, an, accidental, overdose, but, rather, a, result, of, a, head, gash, suffered, after, the, hourglass, heel, of, her, slingback, sandal, caught, in, the, shag, carpet, causing, her, to, lose, her, balance, caserta, did, concede, however, that, drugs, and, or, alcohol, may, have, played, a, role, in, hastening, joplin, s, death, that, night, joplin, was, cremated, at, pierce, brothers, westwood, village, memorial, park, and, mortuary, in, los, angeles, and, her, ashes, were, scattered, from, a, plane, into, the, pacific, ocean, joplin, s, death, in, october, 1970, at, age, 27, stunned, her, fans, and, shocked, the, music, world, especially, when, coupled, with, the, deaths, of, canned, heat, singer, alan, wilson, a, month, earlier, and, rock, icon, jimi, hendrix, 16, days, earlier, both, aged, 27, all, three, musicians, performed, at, the, two, biggest, rock, festivals, of, the, 1960s, monterey, pop, festival, and, woodstock, this, would, later, cause, some, people, to, attribute, significance, to, the, death, of, musicians, at, the, age, of, 27, as, celebrated, in, the, 27, club, music, historian, tom, moon, wrote, that, joplin, had, a, devastatingly, original, voice, music, columnist, jon, pareles, of, the, new, york, times, wrote, that, joplin, as, an, artist, was, overpowering, and, deeply, vulnerable, and, author, megan, terry, said, that, joplin, was, the, female, version, of, elvis, presley, in, her, ability, to, captivate, an, audience, a, book, about, joplin, by, her, publicist, myra, friedman, titled, buried, alive, the, biography, of, janis, joplin, 1973, was, excerpted, in, many, newspapers, at, the, same, time, peggy, caserta, s, memoir, going, down, with, janis, 1973, attracted, much, attention, its, provocative, title, is, a, reference, to, caserta, s, claim, that, she, had, engaged, in, oral, sex, with, joplin, while, they, were, high, on, heroin, in, september, 1970, the, description, provided, by, dan, knapp, caserta, s, co, author, whom, she, denounced, decades, later, repelled, many, people, in, 1973, when, few, books, or, filmed, interviews, of, joplin, or, her, loved, ones, were, accessible, to, the, public, joplin, s, bandmate, sam, andrew, described, caserta, as, halfway, between, a, groupie, and, a, friend, in, an, interview, with, writer, ellis, amburn, soon, after, the, 1973, publication, of, going, down, with, janis, joplin, s, friends, learned, that, graphic, descriptions, of, sexual, acts, and, intravenous, drug, use, were, not, the, only, portions, of, the, book, that, would, haunt, them, according, to, kim, chappell, a, close, friend, of, caserta, and, joplin, caserta, s, book, angered, the, los, angeles, heroin, dealer, whom, she, had, described, in, detail, in, her, book, including, the, make, and, model, of, his, car, according, to, amburn, in, 1973, a, carful, of, dope, dealers, visited, a, los, angeles, lesbian, bar, that, caserta, had, been, frequenting, chappell, who, was, in, the, alley, behind, the, bar, stated, i, was, stabbed, because, when, peggy, s, book, came, out, her, dealer, the, same, one, who, d, given, janis, her, last, fix, didn, t, like, it, that, he, was, referred, to, and, was, out, to, get, peggy, he, couldn, t, find, her, so, he, went, for, her, lover, when, they, realized, who, i, was, they, felt, that, my, death, would, also, hit, peggy, and, so, they, stabbed, me, despite, being, stabbed, three, times, in, the, chest, puncturing, both, lungs, chappell, eventually, recovered, according, to, joplin, s, biographers, caserta, was, among, many, friends, of, joplin, who, did, not, become, clean, and, sober, until, a, long, time, after, joplin, s, death, while, others, died, from, overdoses, although,
