sir, charles, lyell, 1st, baronet, frs, 14, november, 1797, 22, february, 1875, was, a, scottish, geologist, who, demonstrated, the, power, of, known, natural, causes, in, explaining, the, earth, s, history, he, is, best, known, today, for, his, association, with, charles, darwin, and, as, the, author, of, principles, of, geology, 1830, 33, which, presented, to, a, wide, public, audience, the, idea, that, the, earth, was, shaped, by, the, same, natural, processes, still, in, operation, today, operating, at, similar, intensities, the, philosopher, william, whewell, dubbed, this, gradualistic, view, uniformitarianism, and, contrasted, it, with, catastrophism, which, had, been, championed, by, georges, cuvier, and, was, better, accepted, in, europe, the, combination, of, evidence, and, eloquence, in, principles, convinced, a, wide, range, of, readers, of, the, significance, of, deep, time, for, understanding, the, earth, and, environment, lyell, s, scientific, contributions, included, a, pioneering, explanation, of, climate, change, in, which, shifting, boundaries, between, oceans, and, continents, could, be, used, to, explain, long, term, variations, in, temperature, and, rainfall, lyell, also, gave, influential, explanations, of, earthquakes, and, developed, the, theory, of, gradual, backed, up, building, of, volcanoes, in, stratigraphy, his, division, of, the, tertiary, period, into, the, pliocene, miocene, and, eocene, was, highly, influential, he, incorrectly, conjectured, that, icebergs, were, the, impetus, behind, the, transport, of, glacial, erratics, and, that, silty, loess, deposits, might, have, settled, out, of, flood, waters, his, creation, of, a, separate, period, for, human, history, entitled, the, recent, is, widely, cited, as, providing, the, foundations, for, the, modern, discussion, of, the, anthropocene, building, on, the, innovative, work, of, james, hutton, and, his, follower, john, playfair, lyell, favoured, an, indefinitely, long, age, for, the, earth, despite, evidence, suggesting, an, old, but, finite, age, he, was, a, close, friend, of, charles, darwin, and, contributed, significantly, to, darwin, s, thinking, on, the, processes, involved, in, evolution, as, darwin, wrote, in, on, the, origin, of, species, he, who, can, read, sir, charles, lyell, s, grand, work, on, the, principles, of, geology, which, the, future, historian, will, recognise, as, having, produced, a, revolution, in, natural, science, yet, does, not, admit, how, incomprehensibly, vast, have, been, the, past, periods, of, time, may, at, once, close, this, volume, lyell, helped, to, arrange, the, simultaneous, publication, in, 1858, of, papers, by, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, on, natural, selection, despite, his, personal, religious, qualms, about, the, theory, he, later, published, evidence, from, geology, of, the, time, man, had, existed, on, the, earth, lyell, was, born, into, a, wealthy, family, on, 14, november, 1797, at, the, family, s, estate, house, kinnordy, house, near, kirriemuir, in, forfarshire, he, was, the, eldest, of, ten, children, lyell, s, father, also, named, charles, lyell, was, noted, as, a, translator, and, scholar, of, dante, an, accomplished, botanist, it, was, he, who, first, exposed, his, son, to, the, study, of, nature, lyell, s, grandfather, also, charles, lyell, had, made, the, family, fortune, supplying, the, royal, navy, at, montrose, enabling, him, to, buy, kinnordy, house, the, family, seat, is, located, in, strathmore, near, the, highland, boundary, fault, round, the, house, in, the, strath, is, good, farmland, but, within, a, short, distance, to, the, north, west, on, the, other, side, of, the, fault, are, the, grampian, mountains, in, the, highlands, his, family, s, second, country, home, was, in, a, completely, different, geological, and, ecological, area, he, spent, much, of, his, childhood, at, bartley, lodge, in, the, new, forest, in, hampshire, in, southern, england, lyell, entered, exeter, college, oxford, in, 1816, and, attended, william, buckland, s, geological, lectures, he, graduated, with, a, ba, hons, second, class, degree, in, classics, in, december, 1819, and, gained, his, m, a, 1821, after, graduation, he, took, up, law, as, a, profession, entering, lincoln, s, inn, in, 1820, he, completed, a, circuit, through, rural, england, where, he, could, observe, geological, phenomena, in, 1821, he, attended, robert, jameson, s, lectures, in, edinburgh, and, visited, gideon, mantell, at, lewes, in, sussex, in, 1823, he, was, elected, joint, secretary, of, the, geological, society, as, his, eyesight, began, to, deteriorate, he, turned, to, geology, as, a, full, time, profession, his, first, paper, on, a, recent, formation, of, freshwater, limestone, in, forfarshire, was, presented, in, 1826, by, 1827, he, had, abandoned, law, and, embarked, on, a, geological, career, that, would, result, in, fame, and, the, general, acceptance, of, uniformitarianism, a, working, out, of, the, ideas, proposed, by, james, hutton, a, few, decades, earlier, in, 1832, lyell, married, mary, horner, in, bonn, daughter, of, leonard, horner, 1785, 1864, also, associated, with, the, geological, society, of, london, the, new, couple, spent, their, honeymoon, in, switzerland, and, italy, on, a, geological, tour, of, the, area, during, the, 1840s, lyell, travelled, to, the, united, states, and, canada, and, wrote, two, popular, travel, and, geology, books, travels, in, north, america, 1845, and, a, second, visit, to, the, united, states, 1849, in, 1866, he, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, after, the, great, chicago, fire, in, 1871, lyell, was, one, of, the, first, to, donate, books, to, help, found, the, chicago, public, library, in, 1841, lyell, was, elected, as, a, member, to, the, american, philosophical, society, lyell, s, wife, died, in, 1873, and, two, years, later, in, 1875, lyell, himself, died, as, he, was, revising, the, twelfth, edition, of, principles, he, is, buried, in, westminster, abbey, where, there, is, a, bust, to, him, by, william, theed, in, the, north, aisle, lyell, was, knighted, kt, in, 1848, and, later, in, 1864, made, a, baronet, bt, which, is, an, hereditary, honour, he, was, awarded, the, copley, medal, of, the, royal, society, in, 1858, and, the, wollaston, medal, of, the, geological, society, in, 1866, mount, lyell, the, highest, peak, in, yosemite, national, park, is, named, after, him, the, crater, lyell, on, the, moon, and, a, crater, on, mars, were, named, in, his, honour, mount, lyell, in, western, tasmania, australia, located, in, a, profitable, mining, area, bears, lyell, s, name, and, the, lyell, range, in, north, west, western, australia, is, named, after, him, as, well, in, southwest, nelson, in, the, south, island, of, new, zealand, the, lyell, range, lyell, river, and, the, gold, mining, town, of, lyell, now, only, a, camping, site, were, all, named, after, lyell, lyall, bay, in, wellington, new, zealand, was, possibly, named, after, lyell, the, jawless, fish, cephalaspis, lyelli, from, the, old, red, sandstone, of, southern, scotland, was, named, by, louis, agassiz, in, honour, of, lyell, sir, charles, lyell, was, buried, at, westminster, abbey, on, 27, february, 1875, the, pallbearers, included, t, h, huxley, the, rev, w, s, symonds, and, mr, john, carrick, moore, lyell, had, private, means, and, earned, further, income, as, an, author, he, came, from, a, prosperous, family, worked, briefly, as, a, lawyer, in, the, 1820s, and, held, the, post, of, professor, of, geology, at, king, s, college, london, in, the, 1830s, from, 1830, onward, his, books, provided, both, income, and, fame, each, of, his, three, major, books, was, a, work, continually, in, progress, all, three, went, through, multiple, editions, during, his, lifetime, although, many, of, his, friends, such, as, darwin, thought, the, first, edition, of, the, principles, was, the, best, written, lyell, used, each, edition, to, incorporate, additional, material, rearrange, existing, material, and, revisit, old, conclusions, in, light, of, new, evidence, throughout, his, life, lyell, kept, a, remarkable, series, of, nearly, three, hundred, manuscript, notebooks, and, diaries, these, span, lyell, s, long, scientific, career, 1825, 1874, and, offer, an, unrivalled, insight, into, personal, influences, field, observations, thoughts, and, relationships, they, were, acquired, in, 2019, by, the, university, of, edinburgh, s, heritage, collections, thanks, to, a, fundraising, campaign, with, many, generous, individual, and, institutional, donors, from, the, uk, and, overseas, highlights, include, his, travels, throughout, europe, and, the, united, states, of, america, the, drafts, of, his, correspondence, with, the, likes, of, charles, darwin, his, geological, and, landscape, sketches, and, his, constant, gathering, of, evidence, and, refinement, of, his, theories, principles, of, geology, lyell, s, first, book, was, also, his, most, famous, most, influential, and, most, important, first, published, in, three, volumes, in, 1830, 33, it, established, lyell, s, credentials, as, an, important, geological, theorist, and, propounded, the, doctrine, of, uniformitarianism, it, was, a, work, of, synthesis, backed, by, his, own, personal, observations, on, his, travels, the, central, argument, in, principles, was, that, the, present, is, the, key, to, the, past, a, concept, of, the, scottish, enlightenment, which, david, hume, had, stated, as, all, inferences, from, experience, suppose, that, the, future, will, resemble, the, past, and, james, hutton, had, described, when, he, wrote, in, 1788, that, from, what, has, actually, been, we, have, data, for, concluding, with, regard, to, that, which, is, to, happen, thereafter, geological, remains, from, the, distant, past, can, and, should, be, explained, by, reference, to, geological, processes, now, in, operation, and, thus, directly, observable, lyell, s, interpretation, of, geological, change, as, the, steady, accumulation, of, minute, changes, over, enormously, long, spans, of, time, was, a, powerful, influence, on, the, young, charles, darwin, lyell, asked, robert, fitzroy, captain, of, hms, beagle, to, search, for, erratic, boulders, on, the, survey, voyage, of, the, beagle, and, just, before, it, set, out, fitzroy, gave, darwin, volume, 1, of, the, first, edition, of, lyell, s, principles, when, the, beagle, made, its, first, stop, ashore, at, st, jago, in, the, cape, verde, islands, darwin, found, rock, formations, which, seen, through, lyell, s, eyes, gave, him, a, revolutionary, insight, into, the, geological, history, of, the, island, an, insight, he, applied, throughout, his, travels, while, in, south, america, darwin, received, volume, 2, which, considered, the, ideas, of, jean, baptiste, lamarck, in, some, detail, lyell, rejected, lamarck, s, idea, of, organic, evolution, proposing, instead, centres, of, creation, to, explain, diversity, and, territory, of, species, however, as, discussed, below, many, of, his, letters, show, he, was, fairly, open, to, the, idea, of, evolution, in, geology, darwin, was, very, much, lyell, s, disciple, and, brought, back, observations, and, his, own, original, theorising, including, ideas, about, the, formation, of, atolls, which, supported, lyell, s, uniformitarianism, on, the, return, of, the, beagle, october, 1836, lyell, invited, darwin, to, dinner, and, from, then, on, they, were, close, friends, although, darwin, discussed, evolutionary, ideas, with, him, from, 1842, lyell, continued, to, reject, evolution, in, each, of, the, first, nine, editions, of, the, principles, he, encouraged, darwin, to, publish, and, following, the, 1859, publication, of, on, the, origin, of, species, lyell, finally, offered, a, tepid, endorsement, of, evolution, in, the, tenth, edition, of, principles, elements, of, geology, began, as, the, fourth, volume, of, the, third, edition, of, principles, lyell, intended, the, book, to, act, as, a, suitable, field, guide, for, students, of, geology, the, systematic, factual, description, of, geological, formations, of, different, ages, contained, in, principles, grew, so, unwieldy, however, that, lyell, split, it, off, as, the, elements, in, 1838, the, book, went, through, six, editions, eventually, growing, to, two, volumes, and, ceasing, to, be, the, inexpensive, portable, handbook, that, lyell, had, originally, envisioned, late, in, his, career, therefore, lyell, produced, a, condensed, version, titled, student, s, elements, of, geology, that, fulfilled, the, original, purpose, geological, evidences, of, the, antiquity, of, man, brought, together, lyell, s, views, on, three, key, themes, from, the, geology, of, the, quaternary, period, of, earth, history, glaciers, evolution, and, the, age, of, the, human, race, first, published, in, 1863, it, went, through, three, editions, that, year, with, a, fourth, and, final, edition, appearing, in, 1873, the, book, was, widely, regarded, as, a, disappointment, because, of, lyell, s, equivocal, treatment, of, evolution, lyell, a, highly, religious, man, with, a, strong, belief, in, the, special, status, of, human, reason, had, great, difficulty, reconciling, his, beliefs, with, natural, selection, lyell, s, geological, interests, ranged, from, volcanoes, and, geological, dynamics, through, stratigraphy, palaeontology, and, glaciology, to, topics, that, would, now, be, classified, as, prehistoric, archaeology, and, paleoanthropology, he, is, best, known, however, for, his, role, in, elaborating, the, doctrine, of, uniformitarianism, he, played, a, critical, role, in, advancing, the, study, of, loess, from, 1830, to, 1833, his, multi, volume, principles, of, geology, was, published, the, work, s, subtitle, was, an, attempt, to, explain, the, former, changes, of, the, earth, s, surface, by, reference, to, causes, now, in, operation, and, this, explains, lyell, s, impact, on, science, he, drew, his, explanations, from, field, studies, conducted, directly, before, he, went, to, work, on, the, founding, geology, text, he, was, along, with, the, earlier, john, playfair, the, major, advocate, of, james, hutton, s, idea, of, uniformitarianism, that, the, earth, was, shaped, entirely, by, slow, moving, forces, still, in, operation, today, acting, over, a, very, long, period, of, time, this, was, in, contrast, to, catastrophism, an, idea, of, abrupt, geological, changes, which, had, been, adapted, in, england, to, explain, landscape, features, such, as, rivers, much, smaller, than, their, associated, valleys, that, seemed, impossible, to, explain, other, than, through, violent, action, criticizing, the, reliance, of, his, contemporaries, on, what, he, argued, were, ad, hoc, explanations, lyell, wrote, never, was, there, a, doctrine, more, calculated, to, foster, indolence, and, to, blunt, the, keen, edge, of, curiosity, than, this, assumption, of, the, discordance, between, the, former, and, the, existing, causes, of, change, the, student, was, taught, to, despond, from, the, first, geology, it, was, affirmed, could, never, arise, to, the, rank, of, an, exact, science, we, see, the, ancient, spirit, of, speculation, revived, and, a, desire, manifestly, shown, to, cut, rather, than, patiently, untie, the, gordian, knot, sir, charles, lyell, principles, of, geology, 1854, edition, p, 196, quoted, by, stephen, jay, gould, lyell, saw, himself, as, the, spiritual, saviour, of, geology, freeing, the, science, from, the, old, dispensation, of, moses, the, two, terms, uniformitarianism, and, catastrophism, were, both, coined, by, william, whewell, in, 1866, r, grove, suggested, the, simpler, term, continuity, for, lyell, s, view, but, the, old, terms, persisted, in, various, revised, editions, 12, in, all, through, 1872, principles, of, geology, was, the, most, influential, geological, work, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, and, did, much, to, put, geology, on, a, modern, footing, lyell, noted, the, economic, advantages, that, geological, surveys, could, provide, citing, their, felicity, in, mineral, rich, countries, and, provinces, modern, surveys, like, the, british, geological, survey, founded, in, 1835, and, the, us, geological, survey, founded, in, 1879, map, and, exhibit, the, natural, resources, within, their, countries, over, time, these, surveys, have, been, used, extensively, by, modern, extractive, industries, such, as, nuclear, coal, and, oil, before, the, work, of, lyell, phenomena, such, as, earthquakes, were, understood, by, the, destruction, that, they, brought, one, of, the, contributions, that, lyell, made, in, principles, was, to, explain, the, cause, of, earthquakes, lyell, in, contrast, focused, on, recent, earthquakes, 150, yrs, evidenced, by, surface, irregularities, such, as, faults, fissures, stratigraphic, displacements, and, depressions, lyell, s, work, on, volcanoes, focused, largely, on, vesuvius, and, etna, both, of, which, he, had, earlier, studied, his, conclusions, supported, gradual, building, of, volcanoes, so, called, backed, up, building, as, opposed, to, the, upheaval, argument, supported, by, other, geologists, lyell, was, a, key, figure, in, establishing, the, classification, of, more, recent, geological, deposits, long, known, as, the, tertiary, period, from, may, 1828, until, february, 1829, he, travelled, with, roderick, impey, murchison, 1792, 1871, to, the, south, of, france, auvergne, volcanic, district, and, to, italy, in, these, areas, he, concluded, that, the, recent, strata, rock, layers, could, be, categorised, according, to, the, number, and, proportion, of, marine, shells, encased, within, based, on, this, the, third, volume, of, his, principles, of, geology, published, in, 1833, proposed, dividing, the, tertiary, period, into, four, parts, which, he, named, the, eocene, miocene, pliocene, and, recent, in, 1839, lyell, termed, the, pleistocene, epoch, distinguishing, a, more, recent, fossil, layer, from, the, pliocene, the, recent, epoch, renamed, the, holocene, by, french, paleontologist, paul, gervais, in, 1867, included, all, deposits, from, the, era, subject, to, human, observation, in, recent, years, lyell, s, subdivisions, have, been, widely, discussed, in, relation, to, debates, about, the, anthropocene, in, principles, of, geology, first, edition, vol, 3, ch, 2, 1833, lyell, proposed, that, icebergs, could, be, the, means, of, transport, for, erratics, during, periods, of, global, warming, ice, breaks, off, the, poles, and, floats, across, submerged, continents, carrying, debris, with, it, he, conjectured, when, the, iceberg, melts, it, rains, down, sediments, upon, the, land, because, this, theory, could, account, for, the, presence, of, diluvium, the, word, drift, became, the, preferred, term, for, the, loose, unsorted, material, today, called, till, furthermore, lyell, believed, that, the, accumulation, of, fine, angular, particles, covering, much, of, the, world, today, called, loess, was, a, deposit, settled, from, mountain, flood, water, today, some, of, lyell, s, mechanisms, for, geological, processes, have, been, disproven, though, many, have, stood, the, test, of, time, his, observational, methods, and, general, analytical, framework, remain, in, use, today, as, foundational, principles, in, geology, lyell, initially, accepted, the, conventional, view, of, other, men, of, science, that, the, fossil, record, indicated, a, directional, geohistory, in, which, species, went, extinct, around, 1826, when, he, was, on, circuit, he, read, lamarck, s, zoological, philosophy, and, on, 2, march, 1827, wrote, to, mantell, expressing, admiration, but, cautioning, that, he, read, it, rather, as, i, hear, an, advocate, on, the, wrong, side, to, know, what, can, be, made, of, the, case, in, good, hands, he, struggled, with, the, implications, for, human, dignity, and, later, in, 1827, wrote, private, notes, on, lamarck, s, ideas, lyell, reconciled, transmutation, of, species, with, natural, theology, by, suggesting, that, it, would, be, as, much, a, remarkable, manifestation, of, creative, power, as, creating, each, species, separately, he, countered, lamarck, s, views, by, rejecting, continued, cooling, of, the, earth, in, favour, of, a, fluctuating, cycle, a, long, term, steady, state, geohistory, as, proposed, by, james, hutton, the, fragmentary, fossil, record, already, showed, a, high, class, of, fishes, close, to, reptiles, in, the, carboniferous, period, which, he, called, the, first, zoological, era, and, quadrupeds, could, also, have, existed, then, in, november, 1827, after, william, broderip, found, a, middle, jurassic, fossil, of, the, early, mammal, didelphis, lyell, told, his, father, that, there, was, everything, but, man, even, as, far, back, as, the, oolite, lyell, inaccurately, portrayed, lamarckism, as, a, response, to, the, fossil, record, and, said, it, was, falsified, by, a, lack, of, progress, he, said, in, the, second, volume, of, principles, that, the, occurrence, of, this, one, fossil, of, the, higher, mammalia, in, these, ancient, strata, is, as, fatal, to, the, theory, of, successive, development, as, if, several, hundreds, had, been, discovered, in, the, first, edition, of, principles, the, first, volume, briefly, set, out, lyell, s, concept, of, a, steady, state, with, no, real, progression, of, fossils, the, sole, exception, was, the, advent, of, humanity, with, no, great, physical, distinction, from, animals, but, with, absolutely, unique, intellectual, and, moral, qualities, the, second, volume, dismissed, lamarck, s, claims, of, animal, forms, arising, from, habits, continuous, spontaneous, generation, of, new, life, and, man, having, evolved, from, lower, forms, lyell, explicitly, rejected, lamarck, s, concept, of, transmutation, of, species, drawing, on, cuvier, s, arguments, and, concluded, that, species, had, been, created, with, stable, attributes, he, discussed, the, geographical, distribution, of, plants, and, animals, and, proposed, that, every, species, of, plant, or, animal, was, descended, from, a, pair, or, individual, originated, in, response, to, differing, external, conditions, species, would, regularly, go, extinct, in, a, struggle, for, existence, between, hybrids, or, a, war, one, with, another, due, to, population, pressure, he, was, vague, about, how, replacement, species, formed, portraying, this, as, an, infrequent, occurrence, which, could, rarely, be, observed, the, leading, man, of, science, sir, john, herschel, wrote, from, cape, town, on, 20, february, 1836, thanking, lyell, for, sending, a, copy, of, principles, and, praising, the, book, as, opening, a, way, for, bold, speculation, on, that, mystery, of, mysteries, the, replacement, of, extinct, species, by, others, by, analogy, with, other, intermediate, causes, the, origination, of, fresh, species, could, it, ever, come, under, our, cognizance, would, be, found, to, be, a, natural, in, contradistinction, to, a, miraculous, process, lyell, replied, in, regard, to, the, origination, of, new, species, i, am, very, glad, to, find, that, you, think, it, probable, that, it, may, be, carried, on, through, the, intervention, of, intermediate, causes, i, left, this, rather, to, be, inferred, not, thinking, it, worth, while, to, offend, a, certain, class, of, persons, by, embodying, in, words, what, would, only, be, a, speculation, whewell, subsequently, questioned, this, topic, and, in, march, 1837, lyell, told, him, as, a, result, of, his, letters, and, no, doubt, personal, conversations, huxley, and, ernst, haeckel, were, convinced, that, at, the, time, he, wrote, principles, he, believed, new, species, had, arisen, by, natural, methods, adam, sedgwick, wrote, worried, letters, to, him, about, this, by, the, time, darwin, returned, from, the, beagle, survey, expedition, in, 1836, he, had, begun, to, doubt, lyell, s, ideas, about, the, permanence, of, species, he, continued, to, be, a, close, personal, friend, and, lyell, was, one, of, the, first, scientists, to, support, on, the, origin, of, species, though, he, did, not, subscribe, to, all, its, contents, lyell, was, also, a, friend, of, darwin, s, closest, colleagues, joseph, dalton, hooker, and, huxley, but, unlike, them, he, struggled, to, square, his, religious, beliefs, with, evolution, this, inner, struggle, has, been, much, commented, on, he, had, particular, difficulty, in, believing, in, natural, selection, as, the, main, motive, force, in, evolution, lyell, and, hooker, were, instrumental, in, arranging, the, peaceful, co, publication, of, the, theory, of, natural, selection, by, darwin, and, alfred, russel, wallace, in, 1858, each, had, arrived, at, the, theory, independently, lyell, s, views, on, gradual, change, and, the, power, of, a, long, time, scale, were, important, because, darwin, thought, that, populations, of, an, organism, changed, very, slowly,
