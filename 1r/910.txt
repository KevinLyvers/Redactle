about, in, southern, spain, and, north, africa, eventually, settling, in, fez, morocco, some, say, that, his, teacher, in, fez, was, rabbi, yehuda, ha, cohen, ibn, susan, until, the, latter, was,

merchant, maimonides, directed, his, brother, to, procure, goods, only, at, the, sudanese, port, of, aydhab, after, a, long, arduous, trip, through, the, desert, however, david, was, unimpressed, by, the, goods, on, offer, there, against, his, brother, s, wishes, david, boarded, a, ship, for, india, since, great, wealth, was, to, be, found, in, the, east, before, he, could, reach, his, destination, david, drowned, at, sea, sometime, between, 1169, and, 1177, the, death, of, his, brother, caused, maimonides, to, become, sick, with, grief, in, a, letter, discovered, in, the, cairo, geniza, he, wrote, the, greatest, misfortune, that, has, befallen, me, during, my, entire, life, worse, than, anything, else, was, the, demise, of, the, saint, may, his, memory, be, blessed, who, drowned, in, the, indian, sea, carrying, much, money, belonging, to, me, to, him, and, to, others, and, left, with, me, a, little, daughter, and, a, widow, on, the, day, i, received, that, terrible, news, i, fell, ill, and, remained, in, bed, for, about, a, year, suffering, from, a, sore, boil, fever, and, depression, and, was, almost, given, up, about, eight, years, have, passed, but, i, am, still, mourning, and, unable, to, accept, consolation, and, how, should, i, console, myself, he, grew, up, on, my, knees, he, was, my, brother, he, was, my, student, around, 1171, maimonides, was, appointed, the, nagid, of, the, egyptian, jewish, community, arabist, shelomo, dov, goitein, believes, the, leadership, he, displayed, during, the, ransoming, of, the, crusader, captives, led, to, this, appointment, however, he, was, replaced, by, sar, shalom, ben, moses, in, 1173, over, the, controversial, course, of, sar, shalom, s, appointment, during, which, sar, shalom, was, accused, of, tax, farming, maimonides, excommunicated, and, fought, with, him, for, several, years, until, maimonides, was, appointed, nagid, in, 1195, a, work, known, as, megillat, zutta, was, written, by, abraham, ben, hillel, who, writes, a, scathing, description, of, sar, shalom, while, praising, maimonides, as, the, light, of, east, and, west, and, unique, master, and, marvel, of, the, generation, with, the, loss, of, the, family, funds, tied, up, in, david, s, business, venture, maimonides, assumed, the, vocation, of, physician, for, which, he, was, to, become, famous, he, had, trained, in, medicine, in, both, spain, and, in, fez, gaining, widespread, recognition, he, was, appointed, court, physician, to, al, qadi, al, fadil, the, chief, secretary, to, sultan, saladin, then, to, saladin, himself, after, whose, death, he, remained, a, physician, to, the, ayyubid, dynasty, in, his, medical, writings, maimonides, described, many, conditions, including, asthma, diabetes, hepatitis, and, pneumonia, and, he, emphasized, moderation, and, a, healthy, lifestyle, his, treatises, became, influential, for, generations, of, physicians, he, was, knowledgeable, about, greek, and, arabic, medicine, and, followed, the, principles, of, humorism, in, the, tradition, of, galen, he, did, not, blindly, accept, authority, but, used, his, own, observation, and, experience, julia, bess, frank, indicates, that, maimonides, in, his, medical, writings, sought, to, interpret, works, of, authorities, so, that, they, could, become, acceptable, maimonides, displayed, in, his, interactions, with, patients, attributes, that, today, would, be, called, intercultural, awareness, and, respect, for, the, patient, s, autonomy, although, he, frequently, wrote, of, his, longing, for, solitude, in, order, to, come, closer, to, god, and, to, extend, his, reflections, elements, considered, essential, in, his, philosophy, to, the, prophetic, experience, he, gave, over, most, of, his, time, to, caring, for, others, in, a, famous, letter, maimonides, describes, his, daily, routine, after, visiting, the, sultan, s, palace, he, would, arrive, home, exhausted, and, hungry, where, i, would, find, the, antechambers, filled, with, gentiles, and, jews, i, would, go, to, heal, them, and, write, prescriptions, for, their, illnesses, until, the, evening, and, i, would, be, extremely, weak, as, he, goes, on, to, say, in, this, letter, even, on, shabbat, he, would, receive, members, of, the, community, still, he, managed, to, write, extended, treatises, including, not, only, medical, and, other, scientific, studies, but, some, of, the, most, systematically, thought, through, and, influential, treatises, on, halakha, rabbinic, law, and, jewish, philosophy, of, the, middle, ages, in, 1172, 74, maimonides, wrote, his, famous, epistle, to, yemen, it, has, been, suggested, that, his, incessant, travail, undermined, his, own, health, and, brought, about, his, death, at, 69, although, this, is, a, normal, lifespan, maimonides, died, on, 12, december, 1204, 20th, of, tevet, 4965, in, fustat, a, variety, of, medieval, sources, beginning, with, al, qifti, maintain, that, his, body, was, interred, near, lake, tiberias, though, there, is, no, contemporary, evidence, for, his, removal, from, egypt, gedaliah, ibn, yahya, records, that, he, was, buried, in, the, upper, galilee, with, elegies, upon, his, gravestone, in, the, time, of, kimhi, when, the, sons, of, belial, rose, up, to, besmirch, they, did, evil, they, altered, his, gravestone, which, previously, had, been, inscribed, choicest, of, the, human, race, so, that, instead, it, read, the, excommunicated, heretic, but, later, after, the, provocateurs, had, repented, of, their, act, and, praised, this, great, man, a, student, repaired, the, gravestone, to, read, choicest, of, the, israelites, today, tiberias, hosts, the, tomb, of, maimonides, on, which, is, inscribed, from, moses, to, moses, arose, none, like, moses, maimonides, and, his, wife, the, daughter, of, mishael, ben, yeshayahu, halevi, had, one, child, who, survived, into, adulthood, abraham, maimonides, who, became, recognized, as, a, great, scholar, he, succeeded, maimonides, as, nagid, and, as, court, physician, at, the, age, of, eighteen, throughout, his, career, he, defended, his, father, s, writings, against, all, critics, the, office, of, nagid, was, held, by, the, maimonides, family, for, four, successive, generations, until, the, end, of, the, 14th, century, a, statue, of, maimonides, was, erected, near, the, c, rdoba, synagogue, maimonides, is, sometimes, said, to, be, a, descendant, of, king, david, although, he, never, made, such, a, claim, with, mishneh, torah, maimonides, composed, a, code, of, jewish, law, with, the, widest, possible, scope, and, depth, the, work, gathers, all, the, binding, laws, from, the, talmud, and, incorporates, the, positions, of, the, geonim, post, talmudic, early, medieval, scholars, mainly, from, mesopotamia, it, is, also, known, as, yad, ha, chazaka, or, simply, yad, which, has, the, numerical, value, 14, representing, the, 14, books, of, the, work, the, mishneh, torah, made, following, jewish, law, easier, for, the, jews, of, his, time, who, were, struggling, to, understand, the, complex, nature, of, jewish, rules, and, regulations, as, they, had, adapted, over, the, years, later, codes, of, jewish, law, e, g, arba, ah, turim, by, rabbi, jacob, ben, asher, and, shulchan, aruch, by, rabbi, yosef, karo, draw, heavily, on, mishneh, torah, both, often, quote, whole, sections, verbatim, however, it, met, initially, with, much, opposition, there, were, two, main, reasons, for, this, opposition, first, maimonides, had, refrained, from, adding, references, to, his, work, for, the, sake, of, brevity, second, in, the, introduction, he, gave, the, impression, of, wanting, to, cut, out, study, of, the, talmud, to, arrive, at, a, conclusion, in, jewish, law, although, maimonides, later, wrote, that, this, was, not, his, intent, his, most, forceful, opponents, were, the, rabbis, of, provence, southern, france, and, a, running, critique, by, rabbi, abraham, ben, david, raavad, iii, is, printed, in, virtually, all, editions, of, mishneh, torah, nevertheless, mishneh, torah, was, recognized, as, a, monumental, contribution, to, the, systemized, writing, of, halakha, throughout, the, centuries, it, has, been, widely, studied, and, its, halakhic, decisions, have, weighed, heavily, in, later, rulings, in, response, to, those, who, would, attempt, to, force, followers, of, maimonides, and, his, mishneh, torah, to, abide, by, the, rulings, of, his, own, shulchan, aruch, or, other, later, works, rabbi, yosef, karo, wrote, who, would, dare, force, communities, who, follow, the, rambam, to, follow, any, other, decisor, early, or, late, the, rambam, is, the, greatest, of, the, decisors, and, all, the, communities, of, the, land, of, israel, and, the, arabistan, and, the, maghreb, practice, according, to, his, word, and, accepted, him, as, their, rabbi, an, oft, cited, legal, maxim, from, his, pen, is, it, is, better, and, more, satisfactory, to, acquit, a, thousand, guilty, persons, than, to, put, a, single, innocent, one, to, death, he, argued, that, executing, a, defendant, on, anything, less, than, absolute, certainty, would, lead, to, a, slippery, slope, of, decreasing, burdens, of, proof, until, defendants, would, be, convicted, merely, according, to, the, judge, s, caprice, maimonides, composed, works, of, jewish, scholarship, rabbinic, law, philosophy, and, medical, texts, most, of, maimonides, works, were, written, in, judeo, arabic, however, the, mishneh, torah, was, written, in, hebrew, in, addition, to, mishneh, torah, his, jewish, texts, were, maimonides, achievements, in, the, medical, field, are, well, known, and, are, cited, by, many, medieval, authors, one, of, his, more, important, medical, works, is, his, guide, to, good, health, regimen, sanitatis, which, he, composed, in, arabic, for, the, sultan, al, afdal, son, of, saladin, who, suffered, from, depression, the, work, was, translated, into, latin, and, published, in, florence, in, 1477, becoming, the, first, medical, book, to, appear, in, print, there, while, his, prescriptions, may, have, become, obsolete, his, ideas, about, preventive, medicine, public, hygiene, approach, to, the, suffering, patient, and, the, preservation, of, the, health, of, the, soul, have, not, become, obsolete, maimonides, wrote, ten, known, medical, works, in, arabic, that, have, been, translated, by, the, jewish, medical, ethicist, fred, rosner, into, contemporary, english, lectures, conferences, and, research, on, maimonides, even, recently, in, the, 21st, century, have, been, done, at, medical, universities, in, morocco, the, oath, of, maimonides, is, a, document, about, the, medical, calling, and, recited, as, a, substitute, for, the, hippocratic, oath, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, a, more, lengthy, prayer, of, maimonides, these, documents, may, not, have, been, written, by, maimonides, but, later, the, prayer, appeared, first, in, print, in, 1793, and, has, been, attributed, to, markus, herz, a, german, physician, pupil, of, immanuel, kant, the, treatise, on, logic, arabic, maqala, fi, sinat, al, mantiq, has, been, printed, 17, times, including, editions, in, latin, 1527, german, 1805, 1822, 1833, 1828, french, 1936, by, mo, se, ventura, and, in, 1996, by, r, mi, brague, and, english, 1938, by, israel, efros, and, in, an, abridged, hebrew, form, the, work, illustrates, the, essentials, of, aristotelian, logic, to, be, found, in, the, teachings, of, the, great, islamic, philosophers, such, as, avicenna, and, above, all, al, farabi, the, second, master, the, first, master, being, aristotle, in, his, work, devoted, to, the, treatise, r, mi, brague, stresses, the, fact, that, al, farabi, is, the, only, philosopher, mentioned, therein, this, indicates, a, line, of, conduct, for, the, reader, who, must, read, the, text, keeping, in, mind, al, farabi, s, works, on, logic, in, the, hebrew, versions, the, treatise, is, called, the, words, of, logic, which, describes, the, bulk, of, the, work, the, author, explains, the, technical, meaning, of, the, words, used, by, logicians, the, treatise, duly, inventories, the, terms, used, by, the, logician, and, indicates, what, they, refer, to, the, work, proceeds, rationally, through, a, lexicon, of, philosophical, terms, to, a, summary, of, higher, philosophical, topics, in, 14, chapters, corresponding, to, maimonides, birthdate, of, 14, nissan, the, number, 14, recurs, in, many, of, maimonides, works, each, chapter, offers, a, cluster, of, associated, notions, the, meaning, of, the, words, is, explained, and, illustrated, with, examples, at, the, end, of, each, chapter, the, author, carefully, draws, up, the, list, of, words, studied, until, very, recently, it, was, accepted, that, maimonides, wrote, the, treatise, on, logic, in, his, twenties, or, even, in, his, teen, years, herbert, davidson, has, raised, questions, about, maimonides, authorship, of, this, short, work, and, of, other, short, works, traditionally, attributed, to, maimonides, he, maintains, that, maimonides, was, not, the, author, at, all, based, on, a, report, of, two, arabic, language, manuscripts, unavailable, to, western, investigators, in, asia, minor, rabbi, yosef, kafih, maintained, that, it, is, by, maimonides, and, newly, translated, it, to, hebrew, as, beiur, m, lekhet, hahiggayon, from, the, judeo, arabic, through, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, and, the, philosophical, introductions, to, sections, of, his, commentaries, on, the, mishna, maimonides, exerted, an, important, influence, on, the, scholastic, philosophers, especially, on, albertus, magnus, thomas, aquinas, and, duns, scotus, he, was, a, jewish, scholastic, educated, more, by, reading, the, works, of, arab, muslim, philosophers, than, by, personal, contact, with, arabian, teachers, he, acquired, an, intimate, acquaintance, not, only, with, arab, muslim, philosophy, but, with, the, doctrines, of, aristotle, maimonides, strove, to, reconcile, aristotelianism, and, science, with, the, teachings, of, the, torah, in, his, guide, for, the, perplexed, he, often, explains, the, function, and, purpose, of, the, statutory, provisions, contained, in, the, torah, against, the, backdrop, of, the, historical, conditions, the, book, was, highly, controversial, in, its, day, and, was, banned, by, french, rabbis, who, burnt, copies, of, the, work, in, montpellier, in, his, commentary, on, the, mishnah, tractate, sanhedrin, chapter, 10, maimonides, formulates, his, 13, principles, of, faith, and, that, these, principles, summarized, what, he, viewed, as, the, required, beliefs, of, judaism, maimonides, is, said, to, have, compiled, the, principles, from, various, talmudic, sources, these, principles, were, controversial, when, first, proposed, evoking, criticism, by, rabbis, hasdai, crescas, and, joseph, albo, and, were, effectively, ignored, by, much, of, the, jewish, community, for, the, next, few, centuries, however, these, principles, have, become, widely, held, and, are, considered, to, be, the, cardinal, principles, of, faith, for, orthodox, jews, two, poetic, restatements, of, these, principles, ani, ma, amin, and, yigdal, eventually, became, canonized, in, many, editions, of, the, siddur, jewish, prayer, book, the, omission, of, a, list, of, these, principles, as, such, within, his, later, works, the, mishneh, torah, and, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, has, led, some, to, suggest, that, either, he, retracted, his, earlier, position, or, that, these, principles, are, descriptive, rather, than, prescriptive, maimonides, equated, the, god, of, abraham, to, what, philosophers, refer, to, as, the, necessary, being, god, is, unique, in, the, universe, and, the, torah, commands, that, one, love, and, fear, god, deut, 10, 12, on, account, of, that, uniqueness, to, maimonides, this, meant, that, one, ought, to, contemplate, god, s, works, and, to, marvel, at, the, order, and, wisdom, that, went, into, their, creation, when, one, does, this, one, inevitably, comes, to, love, god, and, to, sense, how, insignificant, one, is, in, comparison, to, god, this, is, the, basis, of, the, torah, the, principle, that, inspired, his, philosophical, activity, was, identical, to, a, fundamental, tenet, of, scholasticism, there, can, be, no, contradiction, between, the, truths, which, god, has, revealed, and, the, findings, of, the, human, mind, in, science, and, philosophy, maimonides, primarily, relied, upon, the, science, of, aristotle, and, the, teachings, of, the, talmud, commonly, claiming, to, find, a, basis, for, the, latter, in, the, former, maimonides, admiration, for, the, neoplatonic, commentators, led, him, to, doctrines, which, the, later, scholastics, did, not, accept, for, instance, maimonides, was, an, adherent, of, apophatic, theology, in, this, theology, one, attempts, to, describe, god, through, negative, attributes, for, example, one, should, not, say, that, god, exists, in, the, usual, sense, of, the, term, it, can, be, said, that, god, is, not, non, existent, one, should, not, say, that, god, is, wise, but, it, can, be, said, that, god, is, not, ignorant, i, e, in, some, way, god, has, some, properties, of, knowledge, one, should, not, say, that, god, is, one, but, it, can, be, stated, that, there, is, no, multiplicity, in, god, s, being, in, brief, the, attempt, is, to, gain, and, express, knowledge, of, god, by, describing, what, god, is, not, rather, than, by, describing, what, god, is, maimonides, argued, adamantly, that, god, is, not, corporeal, this, was, central, to, his, thinking, about, the, sin, of, idolatry, maimonides, insisted, that, all, of, the, anthropomorphic, phrases, pertaining, to, god, in, sacred, texts, are, to, be, interpreted, metaphorically, a, related, tenet, of, maimonidean, theology, is, the, notion, that, the, commandments, especially, those, pertaining, to, sacrifices, are, intended, to, help, wean, the, israelites, away, from, idolatry, maimonides, also, argued, that, god, embodied, reason, intellect, science, and, nature, and, was, omnipotent, and, indescribable, he, said, that, science, the, growth, of, scientific, fields, and, discovery, of, the, unknown, by, comprehension, of, nature, was, a, way, to, appreciate, god, maimonides, taught, about, the, developing, of, one, s, moral, character, although, his, life, predated, the, modern, concept, of, a, personality, maimonides, believed, that, each, person, has, an, innate, disposition, along, an, ethical, and, emotional, spectrum, although, one, s, disposition, is, often, determined, by, factors, outside, of, one, s, control, human, beings, have, free, will, to, choose, to, behave, in, ways, that, build, character, he, wrote, one, is, obligated, to, conduct, his, affairs, with, others, in, a, gentle, and, pleasing, manner, maimonides, advised, that, those, with, antisocial, character, traits, should, identify, those, traits, and, then, make, a, conscious, effort, to, behave, in, the, opposite, way, for, example, an, arrogant, person, should, practice, humility, if, the, circumstances, of, one, s, environment, are, such, that, it, is, impossible, to, behave, ethically, one, must, move, to, a, new, location, maimonides, agreed, with, the, philosopher, aristotle, that, the, use, of, logic, is, the, right, way, of, thinking, he, claimed, that, in, order, to, understand, how, to, know, god, every, human, being, must, by, study, and, meditation, attain, the, degree, of, perfection, required, to, reach, the, prophetic, state, despite, his, rationalistic, approach, he, does, not, explicitly, reject, the, previous, ideas, as, portrayed, for, example, by, rabbi, yehuda, halevi, in, his, kuzari, that, in, order, to, become, a, prophet, god, must, intervene, maimonides, teaches, that, prophecy, is, the, highest, purpose, of, the, most, learned, and, refined, individuals, maimonides, wrote, on, theodicy, the, philosophical, attempt, to, reconcile, the, existence, of, a, god, with, the, existence, of, evil, he, took, the, premise, that, an, omnipotent, and, good, god, exists, in, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, maimonides, writes, that, all, the, evil, that, exists, within, human, beings, stems, from, their, individual, attributes, while, all, good, comes, from, a, universally, shared, humanity, guide, 3, 8, he, says, that, there, are, people, who, are, guided, by, higher, purpose, and, there, are, those, who, are, guided, by, physicality, and, must, strive, to, find, the, higher, purpose, with, which, to, guide, their, actions, to, justify, the, existence, of, evil, assuming, god, is, both, omnipotent, and, omnibenevolent, maimonides, postulates, that, one, who, created, something, by, causing, its, opposite, not, to, exist, is, not, the, same, as, creating, something, that, exists, so, evil, is, merely, the, absence, of, good, god, did, not, create, evil, rather, god, created, good, and, evil, exists, where, good, is, absent, guide, 3, 10, therefore, all, good, is, divine, invention, and, evil, both, is, not, and, comes, secondarily, maimonides, contests, the, common, view, that, evil, outweighs, good, in, the, world, he, says, that, if, one, were, to, examine, existence, only, in, terms, of, humanity, then, that, person, may, observe, evil, to, dominate, good, but, if, one, looks, at, the, whole, of, the, universe, then, he, sees, good, is, significantly, more, common, than, evil, guide, 3, 12, man, he, reasons, is, too, insignificant, a, figure, in, god, s, myriad, works, to, be, their, primary, characterizing, force, and, so, when, people, see, mostly, evil, in, their, lives, they, are, not, taking, into, account, the, extent, of, positive, creation, outside, of, themselves, maimonides, believes, that, there, are, three, types, of, evil, in, the, world, evil, caused, by, nature, evil, that, people, bring, upon, others, and, evil, man, brings, upon, himself, guide, 3, 12, the, first, type, of, evil, maimonides, states, is, the, rarest, form, but, arguably, of, the, most, necessary, the, balance, of, life, and, death, in, both, the, human, and, animal, worlds, itself, he, recognizes, is, essential, to, god, s, plan, maimonides, writes, that, the, second, type, of, evil, is, relatively, rare, and, that, humanity, brings, it, upon, itself, the, third, type, of, evil, humans, bring, upon, themselves, and, is, the, source, of, most, of, the, ills, of, the, world, these, are, the, result, of, people, s, falling, victim, to, their, physical, desires, to, prevent, the, majority, of, evil, which, stems, from, harm, one, does, to, oneself, one, must, learn, how, to, respond, to, one, s, bodily, urges, maimonides, answered, an, inquiry, concerning, astrology, addressed, to, him, from, marseille, he, responded, that, man, should, believe, only, what, can, be, supported, either, by, rational, proof, by, the, evidence, of, the, senses, or, by, trustworthy, authority, he, affirms, that, he, had, studied, astrology, and, that, it, does, not, deserve, to, be, described, as, a, science, he, ridicules, the, concept, that, the, fate, of, a, man, could, be, dependent, upon, the, constellations, he, argues, that, such, a, theory, would, rob, life, of, purpose, and, would, make, man, a, slave, of, destiny, in, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, book, iii, chapter, 28, maimonides, draws, a, distinction, between, true, beliefs, which, were, beliefs, about, god, that, produced, intellectual, perfection, and, necessary, beliefs, which, were, conducive, to, improving, social, order, maimonides, places, anthropomorphic, personification, statements, about, god, in, the, latter, class, he, uses, as, an, example, the, notion, that, god, becomes, angry, with, people, who, do, wrong, in, the, view, of, maimonides, taken, from, avicenna, god, does, not, become, angry, with, people, as, god, has, no, human, passions, but, it, is, important, for, them, to, believe, god, does, so, that, they, desist, from, doing, wrong, maimonides, conceived, of, an, eight, level, hierarchy, of, tzedakah, where, the, highest, form, is, to, give, a, gift, loan, or, partnership, that, will, result, in, the, recipient, becoming, self, sufficient, instead, of, living, upon, others, in, his, view, the, lowest, form, of, tzedakah, is, to, give, begrudgingly, the, eight, levels, are, perhaps, one, of, maimonides, most, highly, acclaimed, and, renowned, writings, is, his, treatise, on, the, messianic, era, written, originally, in, judeo, arabic, and, which, he, elaborates, on, in, great, detail, in, his, commentary, on, the, mishnah, introduction, to, the, 10th, chapter, of, tractate, sanhedrin, also, known, as, pere, ele, religious, jews, believed, in, immortality, in, a, spiritual, sense, and, most, believed, that, the, future, would, include, a, messianic, era, and, a, resurrection, of, the, dead, this, is, the, subject, of, jewish, eschatology, maimonides, wrote, much, on, this, topic, but, in, most, cases, he, wrote, about, the, immortality, of, the, soul, for, people, of, perfected, intellect, his, writings, were, usually, not, about, the, resurrection, of, dead, bodies, rabbis, of, his, day, were, critical, of, this, aspect, of, this, thought, and, there, was, controversy, over, his, true, views, eventually, maimonides, felt, pressured, to, write, a, treatise, on, the, subject, known, as, the, treatise, on, resurrection, in, it, he, wrote, that, those, who, claimed, that, he, believed, the, verses, of, the, hebrew, bible, referring, to, the, resurrection, were, only, allegorical, were, spreading, falsehoods, maimonides, asserts, that, belief, in, resurrection, is, a, fundamental, truth, of, judaism, about, which, there, is, no, disagreement, while, his, position, on, the, world, to, come, non, corporeal, eternal, life, as, described, above, may, be, seen, as, being, in, contradiction, with, his, position, on, bodily, resurrection, maimonides, resolved, them, with, a, then, unique, solution, maimonides, believed, that, the, resurrection, was, not, permanent, or, general, in, his, view, god, never, violates, the, laws, of, nature, rather, divine, interaction, is, by, way, of, angels, whom, maimonides, often, regards, to, be, metaphors, for, the, laws, of, nature, the, principles, by, which, the, physical, universe, operates, or, platonic, eternal, forms, thus, if, a, unique, event, actually, occurs, even, if, it, is, perceived, as, a, miracle, it, is, not, a, violation, of, the, world, s, order, in, this, view, any, dead, who, are, resurrected, must, eventually, die, again, in, his, discussion, of, the, 13, principles, of, faith, the, first, five, deal, with, knowledge, of, god, the, next, four, deal, with, prophecy, and, the, torah, while, the, last, four, deal, with, reward, punishment, and, the, ultimate, redemption, in, this, discussion, maimonides, says, nothing, of, a, universal, resurrection, all, he, says, it, is, that, whatever, resurrection, does, take, place, it, will, occur, at, an, indeterminate, time, before, the, world, to, come, which, he, repeatedly, states, will, be, purely, spiritual, maimonides, distinguishes, two, kinds, of, intelligence, in, man, the, one, material, in, the, sense, of, being, dependent, on, and, influenced, by, the, body, and, the, other, immaterial, that, is, independent, of, the, bodily, organism, the, latter, is, a, direct, emanation, from, the, universal, active, intellect, this, is, his, interpretation, of, the, no, s, poietik, s, of, aristotelian, philosophy, it, is, acquired, as, the, result, of, the, efforts, of, the, soul, to, attain, a, correct, knowledge, of, the, absolute, pure, intelligence, of, god, the, knowledge, of, god, is, a, form, of, knowledge, which, develops, in, us, the, immaterial, intelligence, and, thus, confers, on, man, an, immaterial, spiritual, nature, this, confers, on, the, soul, that, perfection, in, which, human, happiness, consists, and, endows, the, soul, with, immortality, one, who, has, attained, a, correct, knowledge, of, god, has, reached, a, condition, of, existence, which, renders, him, immune, from, all, the, accidents, of, fortune, from, all, the, allurements, of, sin, and, from, death, itself, man, is, in, a, position, to, work, out, his, own, salvation, and, his, immortality, baruch, spinoza, s, doctrine, of, immortality, was, strikingly, similar, however, spinoza, teaches, that, the, way, to, attain, the, knowledge, which, confers, immortality, is, the, progress, from, sense, knowledge, through, scientific, knowledge, to, philosophical, intuition, of, all, things, sub, specie, ternitatis, while, maimonides, holds, that, the, road, to, perfection, and, immortality, is, the, path, of, duty, as, described, in, the, torah, and, the, rabbinic, understanding, of, the, oral, law, maimonides, describes, the, world, to, come, as, the, stage, after, a, person, lives, their, life, in, this, world, as, well, as, the, final, state, of, existence, after, the, messianic, era, some, time, after, the, resurrection, of, the, dead, souls, will, live, forever, without, bodies, they, will, enjoy, the, radiance, of, the, divine, presence, without, the, need, for, food, drink, or, sexual, pleasures, maimonides, was, not, known, as, a, supporter, of, kabbalah, although, a, strong, intellectual, type, of, mysticism, has, been, discerned, in, his, philosophy, in, the, guide, for, the, perplexed, maimonides, declares, his, intention, to, conceal, from, the, average, reader, his, explanations, of, sod, esoteric, meanings, of, torah, the, nature, of, these, secrets, is, debated, religious, jewish, rationalists, and, the, mainstream, academic, view, read, maimonides, aristotelianism, as, a, mutually, exclusive, alternative, metaphysics, to, kabbalah, some, academics, hold, that, maimonides, project, fought, against, the, proto, kabbalah, of, his, time, maimonides, employed, rationalism, to, defend, judaism, rather, than, limit, inquiry, of, sod, only, to, rationalism, his, rationalism, if, not, taken, as, an, opposition, also, assisted, the, kabbalists, purifying, their, transmitted, teaching, from, mistaken, corporeal, interpretations, that, could, have, been, made, from, hekhalot, literature, though, kabbalists, held, that, their, theosophy, alone, allowed, human, access, to, divine, mysteries, maimonides, mishneh, torah, is, considered, by, jews, even, today, as, one, of, the, chief, authoritative, codifications, of, jewish, law, and, ethics, it, is, exceptional, for, its, logical, construction, concise, and, clear, expression, and, extraordinary, learning, so, that, it, became, a, standard, against, which, other, later, codifications, were, often, measured, it, is, still, closely, studied, in, rabbinic, yeshivot, seminaries, the, first, to, compile, a, comprehensive, lexicon, containing, an, alphabetically, arranged, list, of, difficult, words, found, in, maimonides, mishneh, torah, was, tan, um, ha, yerushalmi, 1220, 1291, a, popular, medieval, saying, that, also, served, as, his, epitaph, states, from, mosheh, to, mosheh, there, was, none, like, mosheh, it, chiefly, referred, to, his, rabbinic, writings, however, maimonides, was, also, one, of, the, most, influential, figures, in, medieval, jewish, philosophy, his, adaptation, of, aristotelian, thought, to, biblical, faith, deeply, impressed, later, jewish, thinkers, and, had, an, unexpected, immediate, historical, impact, some, more, acculturated, jews, in, the, century, that, followed, his, death, particularly, in, spain, sought, to, apply, maimonides, aristotelianism, in, ways, that, undercut, traditionalist, belief, and, observance, giving, rise, to, an, intellectual, controversy, in, spanish, and, southern, french, jewish, circles, the, intensity, of, debate, spurred, catholic, church, interventions, against, heresy, and, a, general, confiscation, of, rabbinic, texts, in, reaction, the, more, radical, interpretations, of, maimonides, were, defeated, at, least, amongst, ashkenazi, jews, there, was, a, tendency, to, ignore, his, specifically, philosophical, writings, and, to, stress, instead, the, rabbinic, and, halakhic, writings, these, writings, often, included, considerable, philosophical, chapters, or, discussions, in, support, of, halakhic, observance, david, hartman, observes, that, maimonides, clearly, expressed, the, traditional, support, for, a, philosophical, understanding, of, god, both, in, the, aggadah, of, talmud, and, in, the, behavior, of, the, hasid, maimonidean, thought, continues, to, influence, traditionally, observant, jews, the, most, rigorous, medieval, critique, of, maimonides, is, hasdai, crescas, or, adonai, crescas, bucked, the, eclectic, trend, by, demolishing, the, certainty, of, the, aristotelian, world, view, not, only, in, religious, matters, but, also, in, the, most, basic, areas, of, medieval, science, such, as, physics, and, geometry, crescas, critique, provoked, a, number, of, 15th, century, scholars, to, write, defenses, of, maimonides, because, of, his, path, finding, synthesis, of, aristotle, and, biblical, faith, maimonides, had, an, influence, on, christian, theologian, thomas, aquinas, who, refers, to, maimonides, in, several, of, his, works, including, the, commentary, on, the, sentences, maimonides, combined, abilities, in, the, fields, of, theology, philosophy, and, medicine, make, his, work, attractive, today, as, a, source, during, discussions, of, evolving, norms, in, these, fields, particularly, medicine, an, example, is, the, modern, citation, of, his, method, of, determining, death, of, the, body, in, the, controversy, regarding, declaration, of, death, to, permit, organ, donation, for, transplantation, maimonides, remains, one, of, the, most, widely, debated, jewish, thinkers, among, modern, scholars, he, has, been, adopted, as, a, symbol, and, an, intellectual, hero, by, almost, all, major, movements, in, modern, judaism, and, has, proven, important, to, philosophers, such, as, leo, strauss, and, his, views, on, the, importance, of, humility, have, been, taken, up, by, modern, humanist, philosophers, in, academia, particularly, within, the, area, of, jewish, studies, the, teaching, of, maimonides, has, been, dominated, by, traditional, scholars, generally, orthodox, who, place, a, very, strong, emphasis, on, maimonides, as, a, rationalist, one, result, is, that, certain, sides, of, maimonides, thought, including, his, opposition, to, anthropocentrism, have, been, obviated, there, are, movements, in, some, postmodern, circles, to, claim, maimonides, for, other, purposes, as, within, the, discourse, of, ecotheology, maimonides, reconciliation, of, the, philosophical, and, the, traditional, has, given, his, legacy, an, extremely, diverse, and, dynamic, quality, maimonides, has, been, memorialized, in, numerous, ways, for, example, one, of, the, learning, communities, at, the, tufts, university, school, of, medicine, bears, his, name, there, is, also, maimonides, school, in, brookline, massachusetts, maimonides, academy, school, in, los, angeles, california, lyc, e, ma, monide, in, casablanca, the, brauser, maimonides, academy, in, hollywood, florida, and, maimonides, medical, center, in, brooklyn, new, york, beit, harambam, congregation, a, sephardi, synagogue, in, philadelphia, pennsylvania, is, named, after, him, issued, from, 8, may, 1986, to, 1995, the, series, a, of, the, israeli, new, shekel, featured, an, illustration, of, maimonides, on, the, obverse, and, the, place, of, his, burial, in, tiberias, on, the, reverse, on, its, 1, shekel, bill, in, 2004, conferences, were, held, at, yale, university, florida, international, university, penn, state, and, rambam, hospital, in, haifa, israel, which, is, named, after, him, to, commemorate, the, 800th, anniversary, of, his, death, harvard, university, issued, a, memorial, volume, in, 1953, the, israel, postal, authority, issued, a, postage, stamp, of, maimonides, pictured, in, march, 2008, during, the, euromed, conference, of, ministers, of, tourism, the, tourism, ministries, of, israel, morocco, and, spain, agreed, to, work, together, on, a, joint, project, that, will, trace, the, footsteps, of, the, rambam, and, thus, boost, religious, tourism, in, the, cities, of, c, rdoba, fez, and, tiberias, between, december, 2018, and, january, 2019, the, israel, museum, held, a, special, exhibit, dedicated, to, the, writings, of, maimonides, he, is, buried, in, harambam, compound, in, tiberias, other, notable, rabbis, also, buried, in, harambam, compound, complex, are
