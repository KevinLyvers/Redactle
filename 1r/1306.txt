milan, and, naples, during, the, italian, wars, at, the, same, time, he, carved, out, a, state, for, himself, in, central, italy, but, he, was, unable, to, retain, power, for, long, after, his, father, s, death, according, to, machiavelli, this, was, not, due, to, a, lack, of, foresight, but, his, error, in, creating, a, new, pope, like, many, aspects, of, cesare, borgia, s, life, the, date, of, his, birth, is, a, subject, of, dispute, he, was, born, in, subiaco, in, lazio, italy, in, either, 1475, or, 1476, the, illegitimate, son, of, cardinal, roderic, llan, ol, i, de, borja, usually, known, as, rodrigo, borgia, later, pope, alexander, vi, and, his, italian, mistress, vannozza, dei, cattanei, about, whom, information, is, sparse, the, borgia, family, originally, came, from, the, kingdom, of, valencia, and, rose, to, prominence, during, the, mid, 15th, century, cesare, s, great, uncle, alphonso, borgia, 1378, 1458, bishop, of, valencia, was, elected, pope, callixtus, iii, in, 1455, cesare, s, father, pope, alexander, vi, was, the, first, pope, who, openly, recognized, his, children, born, out, of, wedlock, stefano, infessura, writes, that, cardinal, borgia, falsely, claimed, cesare, to, be, the, legitimate, son, of, another, man, domenico, d, arignano, the, nominal, husband, of, vannozza, dei, cattanei, more, likely, pope, sixtus, iv, granted, cesare, a, release, from, the, necessity, of, proving, his, birth, in, a, papal, bull, of, 1, october, 1480, cesare, was, initially, groomed, for, a, career, in, the, church, following, school, in, perugia, and, pisa, cesare, studied, law, at, the, studium, urbis, nowadays, sapienza, university, of, rome, he, was, made, bishop, of, pamplona, at, the, age, of, 15, and, archbishop, of, valencia, at, 17, in, 1493, he, had, also, been, appointed, bishop, of, both, castres, and, elne, in, 1494, he, also, received, the, title, of, abbot, of, the, abbey, of, saint, michel, de, cuxa, along, with, his, father, s, elevation, to, pope, cesare, was, made, cardinal, at, the, age, of, 18, alexander, vi, staked, the, hopes, of, the, borgia, family, on, cesare, s, brother, giovanni, who, was, made, captain, general, of, the, military, forces, of, the, papacy, giovanni, was, assassinated, in, 1497, under, mysterious, circumstances, several, contemporaries, suggested, that, cesare, might, have, been, his, killer, as, giovanni, s, disappearance, could, finally, open, to, him, a, long, awaited, military, career, and, also, solve, the, jealousy, over, sancha, of, aragon, wife, of, cesare, s, younger, brother, gioffre, and, mistress, of, both, cesare, and, giovanni, cesare, s, role, in, the, act, has, never, been, clear, however, he, had, no, definitive, motive, as, he, was, likely, to, be, given, a, powerful, secular, position, whether, or, not, his, brother, lived, it, is, possible, that, giovanni, was, killed, as, a, result, of, a, sexual, liaison, on, 17, august, 1498, cesare, resigned, the, cardinalate, in, order, to, pursue, a, military, career, on, the, same, day, louis, xii, of, france, named, cesare, duke, of, valentinois, this, random, title, was, selected, as, being, homophonous, with, his, nickname, il, valentino, the, valencian, derived, from, his, father, s, papal, epithet, in, latin, valentinus, the, valencian, indicating, his, birth, in, x, tiva, in, the, kingdom, of, valencia, under, the, crown, of, aragon, and, along, with, cesare, s, former, position, as, cardinal, of, valencia, on, 6, september, 1499, he, was, released, from, all, ecclesiastical, duties, and, laicised, from, his, diaconal, orders, because, he, only, was, ordained, deacon, on, 26, march, 1494, and, never, received, other, major, orders, as, priesthood, and, bishop, consecration, cesare, s, career, was, founded, upon, his, father, s, ability, to, distribute, patronage, along, with, his, alliance, with, france, reinforced, by, his, marriage, with, charlotte, d, albret, sister, of, john, iii, of, navarre, in, the, course, of, the, italian, wars, louis, xii, invaded, italy, in, 1499, after, gian, giacomo, trivulzio, had, ousted, its, duke, ludovico, sforza, cesare, accompanied, the, king, in, his, entrance, into, milan, at, this, point, alexander, decided, to, profit, from, the, favourable, situation, and, carve, out, for, cesare, a, state, of, his, own, in, northern, italy, to, this, end, he, declared, that, all, his, vicars, in, romagna, and, marche, were, deposed, though, in, theory, subject, directly, to, the, pope, these, rulers, had, been, practically, independent, or, dependent, on, other, states, for, generations, in, the, view, of, the, citizens, these, vicars, were, cruel, and, petty, when, cesare, eventually, took, power, he, was, viewed, by, the, citizens, as, a, great, improvement, cesare, was, appointed, commander, of, the, papal, armies, with, a, number, of, italian, mercenaries, supported, by, 300, cavalry, and, 4, 000, swiss, infantry, sent, by, the, king, of, france, alexander, sent, him, to, capture, imola, and, forl, ruled, by, caterina, sforza, mother, of, the, medici, condottiero, giovanni, dalle, bande, nere, despite, being, deprived, of, his, french, troops, after, the, conquest, of, those, two, cities, borgia, returned, to, rome, to, celebrate, a, triumph, and, to, receive, the, title, of, papal, gonfalonier, from, his, father, in, 1500, the, creation, of, twelve, new, cardinals, granted, alexander, enough, money, for, cesare, to, hire, the, condottieri, vitellozzo, vitelli, gian, paolo, baglioni, giulio, and, paolo, orsini, and, oliverotto, euffreducci, who, resumed, his, campaign, in, romagna, giovanni, sforza, first, husband, of, cesare, s, sister, lucrezia, was, soon, ousted, from, pesaro, pandolfo, malatesta, lost, rimini, faenza, surrendered, its, young, lord, astorre, iii, manfredi, being, later, drowned, in, the, tiber, by, cesare, s, order, in, may, 1501, the, latter, was, created, duke, of, romagna, hired, by, florence, cesare, subsequently, added, the, lordship, of, piombino, to, his, new, lands, while, his, condottieri, took, over, the, siege, of, piombino, which, ended, in, 1502, cesare, commanded, the, french, troops, in, the, sieges, of, naples, and, capua, defended, by, prospero, and, fabrizio, colonna, on, 24, june, 1501, borgia, s, troops, stormed, the, latter, to, end, the, siege, of, capua, in, june, 1502, he, set, out, for, marche, where, he, was, able, to, capture, urbino, and, camerino, by, treason, he, planned, to, conquer, bologna, next, however, his, condottieri, most, notably, vitellozzo, vitelli, and, the, orsini, brothers, giulio, paolo, and, francesco, feared, cesare, s, cruelty, and, set, up, a, plot, against, him, guidobaldo, da, montefeltro, and, giovanni, maria, da, varano, returned, to, urbino, and, camerino, and, fossombrone, revolted, the, fact, that, his, subjects, had, enjoyed, his, rule, thus, far, meant, that, his, opponents, had, to, work, much, harder, than, they, would, have, liked, he, eventually, recalled, his, loyal, generals, to, imola, where, he, waited, for, his, opponents, loose, alliance, to, collapse, cesare, called, for, a, reconciliation, but, imprisoned, his, condottieri, in, senigallia, then, called, sinigaglia, a, feat, described, as, a, wonderful, deceiving, by, historian, paolo, giovio, and, had, them, strangled, in, 1503, he, conquered, the, republic, of, san, marino, although, he, was, an, immensely, capable, general, and, statesman, cesare, had, trouble, maintaining, his, domain, without, continued, papal, patronage, niccol, machiavelli, cites, cesare, s, dependence, on, the, goodwill, of, the, papacy, under, the, control, of, his, father, as, being, the, principal, disadvantage, of, his, rule, machiavelli, argued, that, had, cesare, been, able, to, win, the, favour, of, the, new, pope, he, would, have, been, a, very, successful, ruler, the, news, of, his, father, s, death, in, 1503, arrived, when, cesare, was, planning, the, conquest, of, tuscany, while, he, was, convalescing, in, castel, sant, angelo, from, an, attack, of, malarial, fever, likely, contracted, on, the, same, occasion, when, alexander, contracted, his, fatal, illness, his, troops, controlled, the, september, 1503, papal, conclave, the, new, pope, pope, pius, iii, supported, cesare, borgia, and, reconfirmed, him, as, gonfaloniere, but, after, a, brief, pontificate, of, twenty, six, days, he, died, borgia, s, deadly, enemy, giuliano, della, rovere, then, succeeded, by, dexterous, diplomacy, in, tricking, the, weakened, cesare, borgia, into, supporting, him, by, offering, him, money, and, continued, papal, backing, for, borgia, policies, in, the, romagna, promises, which, he, disregarded, upon, his, election, as, pope, julius, ii, by, the, near, unanimous, vote, of, the, cardinals, in, the, october, 1503, papal, conclave, realizing, his, mistake, by, then, cesare, tried, to, correct, the, situation, in, his, favour, but, pope, julius, ii, made, sure, of, its, failure, at, every, turn, cesare, was, for, example, forced, by, julius, to, give, up, san, marino, after, occupying, the, republic, for, six, months, cesare, borgia, who, was, facing, the, hostility, of, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, was, betrayed, while, in, naples, by, gonzalo, fern, ndez, de, c, rdoba, a, man, he, had, considered, his, ally, and, imprisoned, there, while, his, lands, were, retaken, by, the, papacy, in, 1504, he, was, transferred, to, spain, and, imprisoned, first, in, the, castle, of, chinchilla, de, montearag, n, in, la, mancha, but, after, an, attempted, escape, he, was, moved, north, to, the, castle, of, la, mota, medina, del, campo, near, segovia, he, did, manage, to, escape, from, the, castle, of, la, mota, with, assistance, and, after, running, across, santander, durango, and, gipuzkoa, he, arrived, in, pamplona, on, 3, december, 1506, and, was, much, welcomed, by, king, john, iii, of, navarre, who, was, missing, an, experienced, military, commander, ahead, of, the, feared, castilian, invasion, borgia, recaptured, viana, navarre, which, had, been, in, the, hands, of, forces, loyal, to, louis, de, beaumont, the, count, of, ler, n, and, ferdinand, ii, of, aragon, s, conspiratorial, ally, in, navarre, but, not, the, castle, which, he, then, besieged, in, the, early, morning, of, 11, march, 1507, an, enemy, party, of, knights, fled, from, the, castle, during, a, heavy, storm, outraged, at, the, ineffectiveness, of, the, siege, borgia, chased, them, only, to, find, himself, on, his, own, the, party, of, knights, discovering, that, he, was, alone, trapped, him, in, an, ambush, where, he, received, a, fatal, injury, from, a, spear, he, was, then, stripped, of, all, his, luxurious, garments, valuables, and, a, leather, mask, covering, half, his, face, disfigured, possibly, by, syphilis, during, his, late, years, borgia, was, left, lying, naked, with, just, a, red, tile, covering, his, genitals, borgia, was, originally, buried, in, a, marbled, mausoleum, king, john, iii, had, ordered, built, at, the, altar, of, the, church, of, santa, mar, a, in, viana, in, navarre, in, northern, spain, set, on, one, of, the, stops, on, the, camino, de, santiago, in, the, 16th, century, the, bishop, of, mondo, edo, antonio, de, guevara, published, from, memory, what, he, had, seen, written, on, the, tomb, when, he, had, paid, a, visit, to, the, church, this, epitaph, underwent, several, changes, in, wording, and, meter, throughout, the, years, and, the, version, most, commonly, cited, today, is, that, published, by, the, priest, and, historian, francisco, de, ales, n, in, the, 18th, century, it, reads, aqu, yace, en, poca, tierra, el, que, todo, le, tem, a, el, que, la, paz, y, la, guerra, en, su, mano, la, ten, a, oh, t, que, vas, a, buscar, dignas, cosas, de, loar, si, t, loas, lo, m, s, digno, aqu, pare, tu, camino, no, cures, de, m, s, andar, here, lies, in, a, little, earth, he, whom, everyone, feared, he, whom, peace, and, war, held, in, his, hand, oh, you, who, go, in, search, of, worthy, things, to, praise, if, you, would, praise, the, worthiest, then, your, path, stops, here, and, you, do, not, need, to, go, any, farther, borgia, was, an, old, enemy, of, ferdinand, of, aragon, and, he, was, fighting, the, count, who, paved, the, way, for, ferdinand, s, 1512, invasion, against, john, iii, and, catherine, of, navarre, while, the, circumstances, are, not, well, known, the, tomb, was, destroyed, sometime, between, 1523, and, 1608, during, which, time, santa, mar, a, was, undergoing, renovation, and, expansion, tradition, goes, that, a, bishop, of, calahorra, considered, it, inappropriate, to, have, the, remains, of, that, degenerate, lying, in, the, church, so, the, opportunity, was, taken, to, tear, down, the, monument, and, expel, borgia, s, bones, to, where, they, were, reburied, under, the, street, in, front, of, the, church, to, be, trodden, on, by, all, who, walked, through, the, town, vicente, blasco, ib, ez, in, a, los, pies, de, venus, writes, that, the, then, bishop, of, santa, mar, a, had, borgia, expelled, from, the, church, because, his, own, father, had, died, after, being, imprisoned, under, alexander, vi, it, was, held, for, many, years, that, the, bones, were, lost, although, in, fact, local, tradition, continued, to, mark, their, place, quite, accurately, and, folklore, sprung, up, around, borgia, s, death, and, ghost, the, bones, were, in, fact, dug, up, twice, and, reburied, once, by, historians, both, local, and, international, the, first, dig, in, 1886, involved, the, french, historian, charles, yriarte, who, also, published, works, on, the, borgias, seeking, the, resting, place, of, the, infamous, cesare, borgia, after, borgia, was, unearthed, for, the, second, time, in, 1945, his, bones, were, taken, for, a, rather, lengthy, forensic, examination, by, victoriano, juaristi, a, surgeon, by, trade, and, borgia, aficionado, and, the, tests, concurred, with, the, preliminary, ones, carried, out, in, the, 19th, century, there, was, evidence, that, the, bones, belonged, to, borgia, cesare, borgia, s, remains, then, were, sent, to, viana, s, town, hall, directly, across, from, santa, mar, a, where, they, remained, until, 1953, they, were, then, reburied, immediately, outside, of, the, church, of, santa, mar, a, no, longer, under, the, street, and, in, direct, danger, of, being, stepped, on, a, memorial, stone, was, placed, over, it, which, translated, into, english, declared, borgia, the, generalissimo, of, the, papal, as, well, as, the, navarrese, forces, a, movement, was, made, in, the, late, 1980s, to, have, borgia, dug, up, once, more, and, put, back, into, santa, mar, a, but, this, proposal, was, ultimately, rejected, by, church, officials, due, to, a, recent, ruling, against, the, interment, of, anyone, who, did, not, hold, the, title, of, pope, or, cardinal, since, borgia, had, renounced, the, cardinalate, it, was, decided, that, it, would, be, inappropriate, for, his, bones, to, be, moved, into, the, church, it, was, reported, that, fernando, sebasti, n, aguilar, the, archbishop, of, pamplona, would, acquiesce, after, more, than, 50, years, of, petitions, and, borgia, would, finally, be, moved, back, inside, the, church, on, 11, march, 2007, the, day, before, the, 500th, anniversary, of, his, death, but, an, archbishopric, spokesman, declared, that, the, church, doesn, t, authorize, any, such, practice, the, local, church, said, that, we, have, nothing, against, the, transfer, of, his, remains, whatever, he, may, have, done, in, life, he, deserves, to, be, forgiven, now, niccol, machiavelli, met, the, duke, on, a, diplomatic, mission, in, his, function, as, secretary, of, the, florentine, chancellery, machiavelli, was, at, borgia, s, court, from, 7, october, 1502, through, 18, january, 1503, during, this, time, he, wrote, regular, dispatches, to, his, superiors, in, florence, many, of, which, have, survived, and, are, published, in, machiavelli, s, collected, works, in, the, prince, machiavelli, uses, borgia, as, an, example, to, elucidate, the, dangers, of, acquiring, a, principality, by, virtue, of, another, although, cesare, borgia, s, father, gave, him, the, power, to, set, up, cesare, ruled, the, romagna, with, skill, and, tact, for, the, most, part, however, when, his, father, died, and, a, rival, to, the, borgia, family, entered, the, papal, seat, cesare, was, overthrown, in, a, matter, of, months, machiavelli, attributes, two, episodes, to, cesare, borgia, the, method, by, which, the, romagna, was, pacified, which, machiavelli, describes, in, chapter, vii, of, the, prince, and, the, assassination, of, his, captains, on, new, year, s, eve, of, 1502, in, senigallia, machiavelli, s, use, of, borgia, is, subject, to, controversy, some, scholars, see, machiavelli, s, borgia, as, the, precursor, of, state, crimes, in, the, 20th, century, others, including, macaulay, and, lord, acton, have, historicized, machiavelli, s, borgia, explaining, the, admiration, for, such, violence, as, an, effect, of, the, general, criminality, and, corruption, of, the, time, cesare, borgia, briefly, employed, leonardo, da, vinci, as, a, military, architect, and, engineer, between, 1502, and, 1503, cesare, provided, leonardo, with, an, unlimited, pass, to, inspect, and, direct, all, ongoing, and, planned, construction, in, his, domain, while, in, romagna, leonardo, built, the, canal, from, cesena, to, the, porto, cesenatico, before, meeting, cesare, leonardo, had, worked, at, the, milanese, court, of, ludovico, sforza, for, many, years, until, louis, xii, of, france, drove, sforza, out, of, italy, after, cesare, leonardo, was, unsuccessful, in, finding, another, patron, in, italy, king, francis, i, of, france, was, able, to, convince, leonardo, to, enter, his, service, and, the, last, three, years, of, leonardo, s, life, were, spent, working, in, france, on, 10, may, 1499, cesare, married, charlotte, of, albret, 1480, 11, march, 1514, a, sister, of, king, john, iii, of, navarre, the, arrangement, was, part, of, a, plan, by, the, navarrese, monarchs, to, ease, tensions, with, the, newly, proclaimed, french, king, louis, xii, by, offering, a, royal, blood, bride, in, his, dealings, with, the, holy, see, they, were, parents, to, a, daughter, louise, borgia, 1500, 1553, cesare, was, also, the, father, to, at, least, 11, illegitimate, children, among, them, are, girolamo, borgia, who, married, isabella, contessa, di, carpi, and, camilla, lucrezia, borgia, the, younger, who, after, cesare, s, death, was, moved, to, ferrara, to, the, court, of, her, aunt, lucrezia, borgia, the, elder, there, are, accounts, recorded, by, machiavelli, during, his, time, spent, with, cesare, borgia, that, provide, insight, into, the, man, machiavelli, found, that, he, could, be, at, times, secretive, and, taciturn, at, other, times, loquacious, and, boastful, he, alternated, bursts, of, demonic, activity, when, he, stayed, up, all, night, receiving, and, dispatching, messengers, with, moments, of, unaccountable, sloth, when, he, remained, in, bed, refusing, to, see, anyone, he, was, quick, to, take, offence, and, rather, remote, from, his, immediate, entourage, and, yet, very, open, with, his, subjects, loving, to, join, in, local, sports, and, to, cut, a, dashing, figure, however, at, other, times, machiavelli, observed, cesare, as, having, inexhaustible, energy, and, an, unrelenting, genius, in, military, matters, and, also, diplomatic, affairs, and, he, would, go, days, and, nights, on, end, without, seemingly, requiring, sleep, he, is, said, to, have, possessed, a, high, intelligence, that, was, recognized, early, during, his, time, at, the, university, of, pisa, nearly, all, contemporary, accounts, of, cesare, borgia, mention, this, intelligence, sometimes, elaborated, further, by, accounts, made, by, allies, and, other, times, only, briefly, mentioned, by, those, who, most, likely, had, a, personal, antipathy, towards, cesare, but, was, still, hinted, at, or, briefly, mentioned, nonetheless, with, his, personality, he, was, able, to, win, the, unwavering, loyalty, of, his, troops, and, also, with, his, most, trusted, friend, and, manservant, micheletto, corella, sources
