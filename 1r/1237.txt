tipperah, to, proceed, to, patna, so, that, he, might, be, in, readiness, to, lead, the, expedition, against, prithvi, narayan, shah, the, considerations, that, weighted, with, the, selection, committee, to, decide, in, favour, of, sending, military, assistance, to, jaya, prakash, malla, can, be, gathered, from, their, letters, the, revival, of, the, declining, almost, dead, trade, relations, with, nepal, and, the, opening, up, of, tibet, trade, through, nepali, territory, were, two, of, the, prime, considerations, under, instructions, from, the, select, committee, capt,

rumbold, and, capt, kinloch, was, busy, gathering, all, relevant, information, that, was, likely, to, help, the, expedition, to, success, in, the, meantime, prithvi, narayan, shah, was, peremptorily, asked, to, accept, the, east, india, company, mediation, to, which, he, sent, an, evasive, reply, in, june, 1767, the, nepali, vakeels, muktananda, and, faqir, ramdoss, who, came, to, solicit, east, india, company, help, on, behalf, of, jaya, prakash, malla, were, examined, by, capt, kinloch, at, patna, with, a, view, to, eliciting, every, information, of, military, importance, the, strength, of, prithvi, narayan, shah, s, troops, as, the, vakeels, said, was, near, about, 50, 000, of, which, again, only, 20, 000, were, stationed, in, the, nepal, valley, and, the, rest, was, engaged, in, cultivation, in, their, native, places, their, arms, comprised, bows, and, arrows, swords, and, matchlocks, the, vakeels, also, made, no, secret, of, the, fact, that, there, was, no, time, to, lose, as, the, break, of, monsoon, the, hilly, paths, would, become, unsafe, and, the, hill, rivers, unforeseeable, they, also, informed, capt, kinloch, how, prithvi, narayan, shah, had, taken, ten,

to, be, covered, by, the, expeditionary, force, was, 96, coss, 384000, yards, and, the, journey, had, to, be, completed, by, eleven, stages, during, the, last, six, stages, of, which, the, nepal, rajah, undertook, to, provide, porters, and, provisions, the, expedition, however, miscarried, and, the, high, hopes, of, the, select, committee, were, dashed, to, the, ground, the, reasons, for, the, failure, were, set, forth, in, a, series, of, letter, that, passed, between, capt, kinloch, and, mr, rumbold, the, latter, the, select, committee, and, the, court, of, directors, the, first, reason, mentioned, the, destruction, of, the, major, part, of, their, provisions, by, a, sudden, torrent, from, the, hills, the, other, reason, was, that, no, help, in, respect, to, provisions, came, from, the, nepal, rajah, and, when, capt, kinloch, had, reached, janakpur, assurances, of, abundant, supply, were, given, by, the, men, of, the, rajah, once, the, troops, would, reach, sindhuli, where, the, seventh, stage, of, the, journey, would, have, ended, but, even, there, the, promised, help, didn, t, come, famine, stared, them, in, the, face, retreat, under, the, present, circumstances, was, out, of, the, question, and, it, was, impossible, to, hold, sindhuli, for, long, as, all, supplies, of, provisions, had, been, cut, off, by, the, enemy, prithvi, narayan, shah, but, as, kinloch, insisted, the, troops, had, to, face, the, holy, river, bagmati, the, troops, had, built, an, improvised, bridge, and, rafts, but, the, violent, torrent, washed, them, down, before, any, army, could, cross, the, river, famished, and, falling, sick, in, an, increasingly, large, number, the, troops, had, no, way, out, but, to, order, an, immediate, retreat, the, retreating, troops, however, were, hotly, pursued, by, the, gorkhas, sent, by, prithvi, narayan, shah, capt, kinloch, then, at, last, returned, to, the, terai, and, occupied, the, territories, of, bara, parsa, and, hilwall, the, miscarriage, of, the, kinloch, expedition, allowed, prithvi, narayan, shah, to, deal, with, the, besieged, capitals, of, kathmandu, patan, bhadgaon, etc, by, the, end, of, the, year, 1768, he, had, succeeded, in, reducing, all, the, cities, that, still, held, out, prithvi, narayan, shah, almost, walked, into, kathmandu, due, to, the, indra, jatra, revelry, in, which, the, nepali, were, sunk, transl, this, is, not, the, nation, gained, by, my, trifle, efforts, this, is, the, garden, of, all, 4, main, castes, and, 36, sub, castes, and, may, all, be, aware, of, this, towards, the, end, of, his, life, prithvi, narayan, shah, was, troubled, by, illness, to, a, great, extent, he, had, probably, started, to, realize, his, end, was, near, which, is, why, he, decided, to, organize, an, unofficial, council, meeting, known, as, bhardaari, sabha, in, this, sabha, he, decided, to, inform, his, brothers, his, son, and, his, ministers, on, why, was, he, involved, in, the, unification, of, nepal, and, what, should, the, appropriate, policies, and, programs, for, the, future, be, regarding, nepal, this, sabha, continued, for, the, whole, day, for, about, 5, 6, hours, the, messages, he, gave, in, this, sabha, was, written, down, by, his, brothers, and, ministers, and, was, compiled, as, divyopadesh, prithvi, narayan, shah, considered, the, state, of, nepal, as, a, yam, between, two, boulders, referring, to, tibet, on, the, north, and, the, emperor, of, seas, to, the, south, he, suggested, that, nepal, should, forever, maintain, a, good, friendship, with, tibet, in, regards, to, his, policy, towards, the, east, india, company, s, rule, however, he, suggested, maintaining, friendliness, but, also, to, be, wary, of, their, shrewdness, shah, opined, that, the, east, india, company, is, currently, occupying, hindustan, forcefully, if, the, hindustanis, wake, up, then, they, will, come, here, in, search, of, safe, forts, hence, prithvi, narayan, shah, connoted, his, soldiers, to, be, prepared, and, build, barriers, and, forts, at, appropriate, locations, 4, the, counsel, king, prithvi, narayan, shah, is, believed, to, have, fallen, sick, in, the, last, week, of, december,

and, porters, i, walked, with, bhanu, jaisi, aryal, astrologer, kulananda, jaisi, dhakal, astrologer, and, other, tharghar, along, the, banks, of, the, river, rapti, after, we, arrived, at, chandragiri, i, asked, them, which, one, was, nepal, and, they, showed, me, pointing, to, patan, bhaktapur, and, kathmandu, in, my, mind, i, was, thinking, that, it, would, be, excellent, if, i, become, the, king, of, all, three, cities, at, exactly, the, same, time, both, jaisis, said, that, maharaj, s, wishes, would, be, fulfilled, i, was, surprised, and, asked, them, how, did, they, know, about, my, wishes, in, my, mind, they, replied, that, while, you, were, watching, at, nepal, three, cities, of, the, valley, you, put, your, hand, at, your, mustache, then, we, thought, that, you, had, a, wish, to, become, the, king, of, nepal, and, we, said, so, when, i, further, asked, whether, these, wishes, would, be, fulfilled, they, stated, that, as, you, have, high, respects, for, cows, brahmins, guests, fakirs, yogis, and, gods, and, goddesses, and, we, have, blessings, of, saraswoti, goddess, of, learning, on, our, hands, you, would, surely, get, the, states, of, nepal, 6, we, walked, through, the, big, pass, of, thangkot, and, reached, dhading, by, crossing, kahlarighat, trekking, day, and, night, 7, i, asked, jaisi, to, write, an, order, rukka, to, my, three, brave, men, who, were, stationed, in, gautan, ko, birhauto, new, settlement, at, gautan, northwest, of, gorkha, liglig, fort, aadh, at, the, side, hill, khawa, of, chepe, river, he, asked, their, names, and, i,

devghat, came, to, gorkha, for, the, darshan, of, gorakhnath, where, we, met, after, his, darshan, 9, i, said, uncle, i, had, gone, to, makwanpur, and, on, the, way, back, i, saw, nepal, i, have, earnest, desire, to, attack, nepal, please, tell, me, how, my, mission, would, be, accomplished, give, me, your, good, counsel, he, gave, me, his, advice, in, the, pancharatra, he, said, when, we, see, we, think, that, there, is, an, incarnation, of, pancha, pandava, five, brothers, including, prithvi, narayan, shah, nepal, can, not, be, captured, without, any, kuruchhetra, place, of, decisive, battle, between, kauravas, and, pandavas, in, mahabharat, lamjung, is, a, garud, gorkha, is, a, snake, and, nepal, is, a, frog, so, first, we, have, to, deceive, garud, to, eat, the, frog, i, said, i, have, four, castes, of, soldiers, on, whom, i, should, trust, the, most, to, mount, an, attack, to, get, quick, suc, cess, he, asked, which, are, the, castes, i, told, him, bahun, khas, magar, and, thakuri, he, replied, bahun, is, like, a, bull, so, it, is, a, sin, to, send, bahun, thakuri, is, like, a, lion, later, there, will, be, a, betrayal, magar, is, like, a, tagan, horse, it, will, be, slow, khas, is, like, a, tazi, turki, horse, so, it, is, better, to, depend, on, khas, for, faster, success, he, gave, other, important, advice, before, he, left, which, i, took, into, consideration, 10, i, went, to, see, king, of, lamjung, ripumardan, shah, we, met, at, chepe, ghat, we, talked, about, peace, the, key, points, which, i, had, in, mind, from, which, there, would, be, a, peace, agreement, ex, actly, the, same, points, were, conveyed, by, kalu, pandey, thus, the, strong, agreement, was, possible, and, established, i, was, surprised, and, thought, that, he, made, me, happy, but, in, the, sacred, car, dinal, documents, of, hinduism, also, it, is, written, that, the, kazi, post, should, be, given, to, the, per, son, with, whom, general, public, are, happy, i, consulted, with, the, public, and, found, that, they, liked, kalu, pandey, they, advised, me, if, you, give, kazi, post, to, him, we, feel, protected, i, also, checked, in, baisi, chaubisi, about, him, and, found, that, they, liked, him, even, though, i, wished, to, give, the, post, of, kazi, to, biraj, bakheti, i, awarded, this, post, to, kalu, pandey, because, he, was, considered, to, be, wiser, 11, then, i, thought, i, will, make, a, bond, between, pandey, and, basnyat, i, asked, kalu, pandey, to, give, his, daughter, s, hand, for, marriage, to, kehar, singh, basnyat, son, of, shivaram, singh, basnyat, thus, through, this, family, bond, i, mounted, an, attack, on, nepal, three, city, states, of, kathmandu, valley, and, won, it, by, the, shields, of, pandeys, and, swords, of, basnyats, 12, i, assigned, ranajit, basnyat, man, singh, rokaha, and, birbhadra, pathak, in, gautanko, birhauto, at, liglig, aadh, and, told, them, that, i, will, come, to, salyankot, devi, for, darshan, on, an, auspicious, day, as, the, deity, is, believed, to, be, giving, blessings, to, the, devotees, which, becomes, true, in, real, life, i, also, reached, there, we, established, tharpu, temporary, camp, in, the, barren, land, i, asked, with, tharghar, and, baraha, umraos, of, salyani, whether, i, can, have, the, darshan, of, the, 13, every, morning, and, evening, i, used, to, go, to, the, door, for, darshan, and, worship, at, the, temple, reciting, religious, texts, and, mantras, one, night, i, had, a, dream, i, saw, one, seven, eight, year, old, girl, with, khadga, curved, swords, in, her, both, hands, coming, near, me, her, face, was, partly, cov, ered, by, a, shawl, i, asked, her, who, is, your, father, she, replied, i, am, the, daughter, of, priest, rana, magar, and, she, gave, me, both, the, swords, something, was, shining, which, she, took, out, from, her, bosom, she, gave, me, something, to, swallow, near, my, mouth, and, said, i, have, fulfilled, your, wishes, so, you, should,

about, the, dream, they, said, that, she, was, the, goddess, and, you, had, a, darshan, of, her, i, immediately, arranged, for, incense, lamp, prayer, cloth, and, fruits, and, sweets, for, the, daily, worship, i, also, managed, and, dedicated, seven, male, buffalos, and, seven, male, goats, for, sacrifice, for, a, special, worship, and, presented, some, lands, near, borlang, ghat, and, the, ghat, s, all, income, to, the, goddess, and, i, left, on, the, same, auspicious, moment, 14, marching, day, and, night, i, arrived, and, established, a, temporary, camp, in, simalchaur, square, my, intention, was, to, capture, nuwakot, but, i, pretended, to, remain, in, khinchet, for, making, canal, for, agricultural, lands, i, used, to, go, to, the, temple, of, beni, indrayani, at, betravati, crossing, the, river, by, boat, for, reciting, religious, texts, i, used, to, meditate, and, concentrate, my, mind, on, devi, goddesses, of, salyankot, indrayani, and, bhairavi, 15, mahamandal, is, like, a, rival, wife, of, nuwakot, in, mahamandal, there, was, a, gyami, jayant, rana, magar, i, sent, him, a, message, saying, that, you, were, our, own, man, leave, mahamandal, and, come, to, join, me, he, retorted, i, was, your, own, man, but, i, had, eaten, the, salt, of, jaya, prakash, malla, so, i, would, fight, till, death, 16, one, day, i, was, sitting, in, the, council, and, i, had, a, nap, i, was, actually, daydreaming, and, i, saw, that, i, was, at, the, temple, of, indrayani, i, overheard, a, voice, saying, that, there, was, an, auspicious, moment, for, attack, on, nuwakot, after, one, week, and, nuwakot, can, be, conquered, i, immediately, asked, astrologer, to, see, the, calendar, he, told, me, that, there, was, one, big, auspicious, moment, in, the, early, morning, of, saturday, after, one, week, 17, at, the, same, given, auspicious, moment, we, climbed, up, to, nuwakot, and, the, battle, broke, out, bali, panth, who, was, our, staunch, fighter, and, my, brother, dalmardan, shah, at, the, age, of, twelve, only, made, a, decisive, stroke, of, the, sword, jethi, tarwar, on, the, head, of, shankhamani, rana, magar, chief, of, nuwakot, and, we, were, victorious, over, nuwakot, and, we, celebrated, this, victo, ry, 18, we, had, established, security, posts, thanas, at, kakani, and, shivapuri, as, battlefront, 19, parshuram, thapa, was, requesting, me, to, come, to, attack, nepal, assuring, his, support, but, in, the, mean, time, he, had, sent, his, brother, to, baisi, chaubisi, with, financial, support, a, sum, of, one, hundred, twenty, thousand, rupees, to, incite, them, to, attack, us, from, rear, and, i, came, to, know, 20, this, state, is, like, a, yam, between, two, rocks, establish, enduring, peace, with, emperor, of, china, establish, peace, with, the, emperor, from, south, sea, east, india, company, king, of, england, but, he, is, very, shrewd, he, is, controlling, hindushthana, india, and, he, has, taken, our, territory, in, the, plains, which, is, at, our, border, if, hindusthana, india, will, unite, they, east, india, compa, ny, will, be, in, difficulty, and, they, will, come, searching, for, forts, establish, forts, based, on, the, prevailing, situations, in, the, potential, routes, and, put, obstacles, and, hurdles, in, them, one, day, that, force, will, come, do, not, go, to, attack, them, but, only, if, they, attack, start, the, war, and, many, of, them, will, be, slain, at, the, chure, pass, we, can, also, seize, the, treasure, trove, of, weaponry, which, can, be, used, by, our, five, to, seven, generations, border, will, be, fixed, up, to, ganga, ganges, river, if, they, can, not, win, the, war, they, will, come, through, persuasion, or, using, so, many, tactics, and, deceptions, against, us, 21, these, forts, are, like, the, throne, of, nepal, if, one, can, secure, these, forts, all, four, emperors, can, be, won, god, has, created, these, forts, there, is, no, need, to, repair, shivapuri, 1, phoolchoki, 2, chandragiri, 3, mahadevpokhari, 4, palung, 5, dapcha, 6, kahule, 7, make, strong, forts, in, these, places, keep, canons, in, each, fort, where, there, are, passes, keep, one, canon, in, each, by, making, the, iron, gate, and, assign, five, soldiers, in, each, place, after, we, do, this, spies, rascals, murderers, and, the, criminals, who, want, to, flee, after, committing, crimes, cannot, do, anything, if, all, the, four, emperors, also, come, to, attack, they, can, do, nothing, 22, i, already, studied, and, examined, the, social, norms, made, by, king, ram, shah, king, jayasthiti, malla, and, king, mahindra, malla, i, had, the, wish, to, make, such, norms, for, twelve, thousand, for, gorkha, if, god, permitted, i, wanted, to, open, the, routes, of, nepal, by, closing, the, routes, of, the, east, and, the, west, i, wished, to, make, rules, for, each, race, and, caste, to, practice, their, own, rituals, freely, 23, these, three, cities, are, like, cold, rock, the, big, thing, here, is, only, intrigues, the, people, who, drink, the, water, of, wells, do, not, have, any, wisdom, they, are, not, also, brave, only, conspiracies, are, common, my, wish, was, to, make, a, palace, in, dahachowk, including, the, houses, of, priests, brothers, courtiers, mir, umrao, chief, officials, of, forts, in, surrounding, areas, and, i, wished, to, go, to, the, three, cities, only, for, recreation, purpose, 24, do, not, give, entry, to, the, foreign, merchants, to, climb, above, godhparsa, parsa, fort, if, they, come, to, our, country, they, will, make, the, people, bankrupt, 25, we, won, three, cities, of, nepal, nine, lakh, nine, hundred, thousand, kirats, and, the, state, of, hindupati, by, wearing, chyanga, panga, garments, made, from, coarse, textile, produced, in, the, 26, do, not, award, contracts, in, the, country, government, itself, should, give, works, on, the, basis, of, daily, wages, under, one, office, and, keep, accounts, of, each, and, every, income, and, expenditure, even, if, there, are, good, soldiers, and, courtiers, stop, them, earning, undue, properties, watch, them, closely, and, allow, them, to, have, properties, only, to, maintain, their, conditions, and, posts, it, is, because, the, rich, people, can, not, have, courage, to, fight, with, the, swords, and, kill, others, and, die, in, the, battle, if, not, controlled, only, bad, people, or, enemy, would, shine, prevail, if, soldiers, brothers, and, courtiers, do, not, involve, themselves, in, entertainments, and, recreational, activities, my, swords, will, prevail, in, all, four, directions, if, not, there, will, be, anarchy, 27, i, conquered, this, country, with, no, smaller, hardships, hence, it, is, a, garden, of, all, sorts, castes, of, people, everyone, should, be, aware, of, this, all, people, big, and, small, of, four, races, and, thirty, six, castes, of, this, garden, country, should, maintain, and, develop, this, garden, this, is, a, real, land, of, the, hindus, do, not, abandon, your, own, religion, being, practiced, for, generations, 28, everybody, should, be, loyal, to, the, master, king, and, work, for, him, do, not, take, away, the, post, of, kapardar, treasurer, from, the, descendants, of, kalu, khadka, magar, kapardar, do, not, take, away, the, responsibility, of, maintaining, peace, with, the, south, east, india, company, or, india, from, the, descendants, of, shivram, singh, basnyat, do, not, take, away, the, responsibility, of, maintaining, peace, with, tibet, from, the, descendants, of, kalu, pandey, 29, while, extending, compensation, to, pandey, basnyat, pantha, brothers, and, magar, give, them, in, rotational, basis, they, are, all, my, good, loyal, servants, of, salt, and, of, gratefulness, if, they, had, committed, any, grave, wrong, doing, even, to, the, extent, of, equivalence, of, death, penalty, do, not, kill, them, but, send, them, to, war, if, they, survive, it, is, well, and, good, but, if, they, die, in, the, battle, you, do, not, have, to, take, the, blame, of, their, deaths, because, they, were, killed, by, others, king, should, not, kill, his, people, in, his, own, house, 30, king, should, see, that, the, justice, is, done, do, not, give, any, space, to, injustice, in, the, state, people, who, give, bribe, and, corrupt, officials, who, take, bribe, are, the, big, enemies, of, the, king, state, there, is, no, sin, whatsoever, if, you, confiscate, their, property, and, take, even, the, life, of, these, types, of, people, 31, the, main, thing, is, that, king, should, give, lands, to, the, soldiers, whose, service, is, required, to, the, state, they, will, better, manage, and, irrigate, the, land, and, make, some, incomes, from, such, activ, ities, both, tiller, and, owner, will, get, economic, benefits, their, families, will, be, free, of, economic, burden, thus, soldiers, will, feel, confident, whether, they, are, at, the, gate, of, the, palace, near, or, in, the, forts, far, 32, while, making, administrative, appointments, arrange, for, a, company, with, hundred, guns, and, you, should, examine, and, appoint, a, subedar, of, this, company, who, has, been, already, a, hero, in, 33, in, each, group, appoint, people, from, four, castes, namely, khas, magar, gurung, and, thakuri, in, the, battle, this, would, be, very, strong, these, are, the, only, people, who, can, hold, the, swords, or, weapons, for, battle, thus, we, can, even, challenge, the, throne, of, indra, king, of, heaven, according, to, hindu, mythology, no, matter, any, other, enemy, 34, if, we, have, with, us, thousands, of, bows, thousands, of, guns, thousands, of, curved, swords, and, thousands, of, canons, we, can, even, win, over, indra, 35, in, the, wars, those, who, participate, and, those, who, attack, and, kill, are, equal, while, giving, job, or, lands, give, them, equally, if, someone, dies, in, the, battle, his, family, should, be, given, compen, sation, till, his, son, sons, are, able, to, fight, after, they, are, of, the, age, to, take, swords, promote, them, to, a, job, if, king, has, wisdom, best, fighters, soldiers, would, come, to, join, us, from, other, foreign, states, also, expecting, a, lot, of, good, income, 36, basic, foundation, of, the, king, are, soldiers, and, people, if, the, king, is, clever, he, should, keep, them, in, good, humour, thus, there, will, be, no, law, and, order, problem, keep, soldiers, always, on, their, toes, sharpening, them, through, training, such, well, trained, soldiers, do, not, involve, themselves, in, unwarranted, activities, and, we, will, accomplish, our, mission, 37, among, gurung, magar, khanzyada, royal, family, members, brothers, courtiers, mir, umrao, tharghar, select, veteran, people, to, head, the, units, in, the, palace, and, at, the, forts, located, far, and, wide, do, not, give, the, entry, to, the, brahmin, and, khas, of, the, east, and, the, west, in, the, palace, why, because, they, will, bring, about, mismanagement, in, the, palace, statecraft, 38, keep, all, powers, of, the, king, to, yourself, i, had, made, three, baraha, umrao, chiefs, of, hilltops, or, forts, strong, like, the, vajra, firmness, of, spirit, of, indra, i, had, also, given, them, big, drums, and, nishans, special, religious, military, flag, and, budget, of, 240, rupees, to, each, they, used, to, go, for, battle, whether, it, is, in, salyan, liglig, or, dhading, and, they, were, always, victorious, thus, i, had, earned, unimaginable, property, for, the, state, 39, keep, your, house, always, strong, by, selecting, experienced, and, loyal, people, around, you, if, you, do, this, check, and, balance, the, palace, state, will, be, strong, if, a, king, is, clever, he, should, make, soldiers, and, people, happy, and, keep, them, under, his, control, he, should, not, believe, in, the, false, praise, of, some, people, but, ask, them, to, work, on, the, basis, of, salt, eaten, loyalty, 40, operate, the, mint, coins, of, the, state, also, in, a, pure, and, clean, manner, in, the, judicial, court, appoint, dittha, select, among, the, thakuris, and, appoint, the, best, one, likewise, clark, of, the, court, appoint, bichari, from, among, the, magars, operate, the, courts, as, per, the, principles, of, justice, appointing, one, pandit, judge, in, each, place, 41, 42, if, mineral, resources, are, discovered, in, the, village, evacuate, the, people, of, the, village, and, oper, ate, the, mines, 43, if, a, house, is, on, the, waterway, in, the, terrace, move, the, house, to, another, land, and, make, the, canal, for, irrigation, 44, once, they, gave, me, hand, to, make, peace, i, was, called, by, them, but, when, i, went, there, they, lat, er, betrayed, me, i, took, a, lot, of, hardships, to, clear, the, rear, baisi, chaubisi, and, was, able, to, move, ahead, to, capture, nepal, 45, armed, naga, soldiers, were, invited, from, the, south, to, serve, the, interests, of, jaya, parakash, malla, i, killed, them, in, saatgaun, before, they, could, enter, nepal, kathmandu, valley, 46, qasim, ali, khan, attacked, makwanpur, and, i, won, them, killing, many, by, the, strikes, of, 120, curved, swords, khunda, and, by, chasing, their, remaining, soldiers, across, the, border, 47, handi, saheb, attacked, sindhuli, gadhi, with, 3, 4, battalions, and, there, also, i, killed, many, and, seized, many, guns, from, them, 48, three, muslims, came, from, lukhnow, to, nuwakot, to, meet, me, and, ask, for, jobs, these, muslims, knew, how, to, operate, the, seized, guns, and, i, gave, the, post, of, adjutants, to, all, three, namely, sheikh, zorabar, memtaki, and, bhekharsing, they, trained, the, soldiers, 49, when, i, studied, the, book, of, nepal, chronicles, it, was, written, that, nepal, would, be, a, turkana, magarat, and, muglana, territory, of, east, india, company, it, became, already, a, turkana, turk, ish, invasion, of, kathmandu, valley, in, 1347, ad, by, bengal, s, turkish, origin, sultan, shamsuddin, ilias, shah, i, myself, is, the, king, of, magarat, this, has, been, also, alright, but, to, save, it, from, be, coming, muglana, i, created, military, companies, as, that, of, muglana, by, reducing, the, number, of, thums, hill, tops, and, forts, for, austerity, so, as, to, pay, for, the, half, number, of, troops, with, guns, and, the, other, half, with, swords, 50, a, company, with, hundred, guns, is, swift, and, it, is, equivalent, to, one, thousand, soldiers, keep, one, company, with, guns, each, in, every, fort, territories, should, be, divided, and, delineated, give, sol, diers, additional, cereals, and, other, expenses, for, tending, the, fort, 51, i, have, one, serious, doubt, about, muglana, which, is, very, near, from, us, there, are, all, sorts, of, people, like, chhokra, eunuchs, and, patriya, those, women, who, do, not, have, any, shame, they, play, drums, dholak, sitar, raag, and, taan, indian, classical, music, in, a, room, with, fresco, paintings, i, am, very, much, concerned, that, our, youth, might, mingle, with, them, and, forget, their, duties, there, is, an, obsession, in, raagas, and, a, lot, of, money, is, spent, they, will, take, our, secret, information, and, our, enemies, might, betray, us, nobody, should, practice, raagas, do, not, open, the, route, to, the, hills, to, these, three, types, of, people, namely, chhokra, patriya, and, singers, if, you, really, want, to, see, their, performances, you, can, invite, them, during, faagu, in, a, very, few, number, one, or, two, only, and, send, them, back, immediately, thus, they, do, not, know, our, secrets, also, 52, if, you, want, to, entertain, yourselves, you, can, watch, the, traditional, dance, of, newars, of, the, three, cities, as, per, our, religious, texts, shastra, if, you, give, money, to, them, it, will, remain, in, our, own, country, thus, our, country, can, remain, unchallengeable, from, the, book, a, short, biography, of, king, prithvi, narayan, shaha, and, his, counsel, to, the, people, of, nepal, by, dr, niranjan, man, singh, basnyat,
