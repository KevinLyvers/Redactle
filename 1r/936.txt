patara, in, anatolia, in, modern, day, antalya, province, turkey, during, the, time, of, the, roman, empire, because, of, the, many, miracles, attributed, to, his, intercession, he, is, also, known, as, nicholas, the, wonderworker, saint, nicholas, is, the, patron, saint, of, sailors, merchants, archers, repentant, thieves, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, toymakers, unmarried, people, and, students, in, various, cities, and, countries, around, europe, his, reputation, evolved, among, the, pious, as, was, common, for, early, christian, saints, and, his, legendary, habit, of, secret, gift, giving, gave, rise, to, the, folklore, of, santa, claus, saint, nick, through, sinterklaas, little, is, known, about, the, historical, saint, nicholas, the, earliest, accounts, of, his, life, were, written, centuries, after, his, death, and, probably, contain, legendary, elaborations, he, is, said, to, have, been, born, in, the, anatolian, seaport, of, patara, lycia, in, asia, minor, to, wealthy, christian, parents, in, one, of, the, earliest, attested, and, most, famous, incidents, from, his, life, he, is, said, to, have, rescued, three, girls, from, being, forced, into, prostitution, by, dropping, a, sack, of, gold, coins, through, the, window, of, their, house, each, night, for, three, nights, so, their, father, could, pay, a, dowry, for, each, of, them, other, early, stories, tell, of, him, calming, a, storm, at, sea, saving, three, innocent, soldiers, from, wrongful, execution, and, chopping, down, a, tree, possessed, by, a, demon, in, his, youth, he, is, said, to, have, made, a, pilgrimage, to, egypt, and, syria, palaestina, shortly, after, his, return, he, became, bishop, of, myra, he, was, later, cast, into, prison, during, the, persecution, of, diocletian, but, was, released, after, the, accession, of, constantine, an, early, list, makes, him, an, attendee, at, the, first, council, of, nicaea, in, 325, but, he, is, never, mentioned, in, any, writings, by, people, who, were, at, the, council, late, unsubstantiated, legends, claim, that, he, was, temporarily, defrocked, and, imprisoned, during, the, council, for, slapping, the, heretic, arius, another, famous, late, legend, tells, how, he, resurrected, three, children, who, had, been, murdered, and, pickled, in, brine, by, a, butcher, planning, to, sell, them, as, pork, during, a, famine, fewer, than, 200, years, after, nicholas, s, death, the, st, nicholas, church, was, built, in, myra, under, the, orders, of, theodosius, ii, over, the, site, of, the, church, where, he, had, served, as, bishop, and, his, remains, were, moved, to, a, sarcophagus, in, that, church, in, 1087, while, the, greek, christian, inhabitants, of, the, region, were, subjugated, by, the, newly, arrived, muslim, seljuk, turks, and, soon, after, the, beginning, of, the, east, west, schism, a, group, of, merchants, from, the, italian, city, of, bari, removed, the, major, bones, of, nicholas, s, skeleton, from, his, sarcophagus, in, the, church, without, authorization, and, brought, them, to, their, hometown, where, they, are, now, enshrined, in, the, basilica, di, san, nicola, the, remaining, bone, fragments, from, the, sarcophagus, were, later, removed, by, venetian, sailors, and, taken, to, venice, during, the, first, crusade, very, little, is, known, about, saint, nicholas, s, historical, life, any, writings, nicholas, himself, may, have, produced, have, been, lost, and, he, is, not, mentioned, by, any, contemporary, chroniclers, this, is, not, surprising, since, nicholas, lived, during, a, turbulent, time, in, roman, history, the, earliest, mentions, of, saint, nicholas, indicate, that, by, the, sixth, century, his, following, was, already, well, established, less, than, two, hundred, years, after, saint, nicholas, s, probable, death, the, eastern, roman, emperor, theodosius, ii, ruled, 401, 450, ordered, the, building, of, the, church, of, saint, nicholas, in, myra, which, thereby, preserves, an, early, mention, of, his, name, the, byzantine, historian, procopius, also, mentions, that, the, emperor, justinian, i, ruled, 527, 565, renovated, churches, in, constantinople, dedicated, to, saint, nicholas, and, saint, priscus, which, may, have, originally, been, built, as, early, as, c, 490, nicholas, s, name, also, occurs, as, nicholas, of, myra, of, lycia, on, the, tenth, line, of, a, list, of, attendees, at, the, council, of, nicaea, included, by, theodore, lector, in, the, historiae, ecclesiasticae, tripartitae, epitome, written, sometime, between, 510, and, 515, a, single, offhand, mention, of, nicholas, of, myra, also, occurs, in, the, biography, of, another, saint, saint, nicholas, of, sion, who, apparently, took, the, name, nicholas, to, honor, him, the, life, of, saint, nicholas, of, sion, written, around, 250, years, after, nicholas, of, myra, s, death, briefly, mentions, nicholas, of, sion, visiting, nicholas, s, tomb, to, pay, homage, to, him, according, to, jeremy, seal, the, fact, that, nicholas, had, a, tomb, that, could, be, visited, serves, as, the, almost, solitary, definitive, proof, that, he, was, a, real, historical, figure, in, his, treatise, de, statu, animarum, post, mortem, written, c, 583, the, theologian, eustratius, of, constantinople, cites, saint, nicholas, of, myra, s, miracle, of, the, three, generals, as, evidence, that, souls, may, work, independent, from, the, body, eustratius, credits, a, lost, life, of, saint, nicholas, as, his, source, nearly, all, the, sources, eustratius, references, date, from, the, late, fourth, century, to, early, fifth, century, indicating, the, life, of, saint, nicholas, to, which, he, refers, was, probably, written, during, this, time, period, shortly, after, nicholas, s, death, the, earliest, complete, account, of, nicholas, s, life, that, has, survived, to, the, present, is, a, life, of, saint, nicholas, written, in, the, early, ninth, century, by, michael, the, archimandrite, 814, 842, nearly, 500, years, after, nicholas, s, probable, death, despite, its, extremely, late, date, michael, the, archimandrite, s, life, of, saint, nicholas, is, believed, to, heavily, rely, on, older, written, sources, and, oral, traditions, the, identity, and, reliability, of, these, sources, however, remains, uncertain, catholic, historian, d, l, cann, and, medievalist, charles, w, jones, both, consider, michael, the, archimandrite, s, life, the, only, account, of, saint, nicholas, that, is, likely, to, contain, any, historical, truth, jona, lendering, a, dutch, historian, of, classical, antiquity, notes, that, michael, the, archimandrite, s, life, does, not, contain, a, conversion, narrative, which, was, unusual, for, saints, lives, of, the, period, when, it, was, written, he, therefore, argues, that, it, is, possible, michael, the, archimandrite, may, have, been, relying, on, a, source, written, before, conversion, narratives, became, popular, which, would, be, a, positive, indication, of, that, source, s, reliability, he, notes, that, many, of, the, stories, recounted, by, michael, the, archimandrite, closely, resemble, stories, told, about, the, first, century, ad, neopythagorean, philosopher, apollonius, of, tyana, in, the, life, of, apollonius, of, tyana, an, eight, volume, biography, of, him, written, in, the, early, third, century, by, the, greek, writer, philostratus, christian, storytellers, were, known, to, adapt, older, pagan, legends, and, attribute, them, to, christian, saints, as, apollonius, s, hometown, of, tyana, was, not, far, from, myra, lendering, contends, that, many, popular, stories, about, apollonius, may, have, become, attached, to, saint, nicholas, accounts, of, saint, nicholas, s, life, agree, on, the, essence, of, his, story, but, modern, historians, disagree, regarding, how, much, of, this, story, is, actually, rooted, in, historical, fact, traditionally, nicholas, was, born, in, the, city, of, patara, lycia, et, pamphylia, a, port, on, the, mediterranean, sea, in, asia, minor, in, the, roman, empire, to, a, wealthy, family, of, greek, christians, according, to, some, accounts, his, parents, were, named, epiphanius, epiph, nios, and, johanna, i, nna, but, according, to, others, they, were, named, theophanes, theoph, n, s, and, nonna, n, nna, in, some, accounts, nicholas, s, uncle, was, the, bishop, of, the, city, of, myra, also, in, lycia, recognizing, his, nephew, s, calling, nicholas, s, uncle, ordained, him, as, a, priest, after, his, parents, died, from, an, epidemic, nicholas, is, said, to, have, distributed, their, wealth, to, the, poor, in, his, most, famous, exploit, which, is, first, attested, in, michael, the, archimandrite, s, life, of, saint, nicholas, nicholas, heard, of, a, devout, man, who, had, once, been, wealthy, but, had, lost, all, of, his, money, due, to, the, plotting, and, envy, of, satan, the, man, could, not, afford, proper, dowries, for, his, three, daughters, this, meant, that, they, would, remain, unmarried, and, probably, in, absence, of, any, other, possible, employment, be, forced, to, become, prostitutes, hearing, of, the, girls, plight, nicholas, decided, to, help, them, but, being, too, modest, to, help, the, family, in, public, or, to, save, them, the, humiliation, of, accepting, charity, he, went, to, the, house, under, the, cover, of, night, and, threw, a, purse, filled, with, gold, coins, through, the, window, opening, into, the, house, the, father, immediately, arranged, a, marriage, for, his, first, daughter, and, after, her, wedding, nicholas, threw, a, second, bag, of, gold, through, the, same, window, late, at, night, according, to, michael, the, archimandrite, s, account, after, the, second, daughter, was, married, the, father, stayed, awake, for, at, least, two, nights, and, caught, saint, nicholas, in, the, same, act, of, charity, toward, the, third, daughter, the, father, fell, on, his, knees, thanking, him, and, nicholas, ordered, him, not, to, tell, anyone, about, the, gifts, the, scene, of, nicholas, s, secret, gift, giving, is, one, of, the, most, popular, scenes, in, christian, devotional, art, appearing, in, icons, and, frescoes, from, across, europe, although, depictions, vary, depending, on, time, and, place, nicholas, is, often, shown, wearing, a, cowl, while, the, daughters, are, typically, shown, in, bed, dressed, in, their, nightclothes, many, renderings, contain, a, cypress, tree, or, a, cross, shaped, cupola, the, historicity, of, this, incident, is, disputed, adam, c, english, argues, for, a, historical, kernel, to, the, legend, noting, the, story, s, early, attestation, as, well, as, the, fact, that, no, similar, stories, were, told, about, any, other, christian, saints, jona, lendering, who, also, argues, for, the, story, s, authenticity, notes, that, a, similar, story, is, told, in, philostratus, s, life, of, apollonius, of, tyana, in, which, apollonius, gives, money, to, an, impoverished, father, but, posits, that, michael, the, archimandrite, s, account, is, markedly, different, philostratus, does, not, mention, the, fate, of, the, daughters, and, in, his, story, apollonius, s, generosity, is, purely, motivated, out, of, sympathy, for, the, father, in, michael, the, archimandrite, s, account, however, saint, nicholas, is, instead, expressly, stated, to, be, motivated, by, a, desire, to, save, the, daughters, from, being, sold, into, prostitution, he, argues, that, this, desire, to, help, women, is, most, characteristic, of, fourth, century, christianity, due, to, the, prominent, role, women, played, in, the, early, christian, movement, rather, than, greco, roman, paganism, or, the, christianity, of, michael, the, archimandrite, s, time, in, the, ninth, century, by, which, point, the, position, of, women, had, drastically, declined, nicholas, is, also, said, to, have, visited, the, holy, land, the, ship, he, was, on, was, nearly, destroyed, by, a, terrible, storm, but, he, rebuked, the, waves, causing, the, storm, to, subside, thus, nicholas, became, venerated, as, the, patron, saint, of, sailors, and, travelers, while, in, palestine, nicholas, is, said, to, have, lived, in, a, crypt, near, bethlehem, where, the, nativity, of, jesus, is, believed, to, have, taken, place, over, the, crypt, where, nicholas, is, believed, to, have, lived, now, stands, the, church, of, saint, nicholas, in, beit, jala, a, christian, town, of, which, nicholas, is, the, patron, saint, after, visiting, the, holy, land, nicholas, returned, to, myra, the, bishop, of, myra, who, had, succeeded, nicholas, s, uncle, had, recently, died, and, the, priests, in, the, city, had, decided, that, the, first, priest, to, enter, the, church, that, morning, would, be, made, bishop, nicholas, went, to, the, church, to, pray, and, was, therefore, proclaimed, the, new, bishop, he, is, said, to, have, been, imprisoned, and, tortured, during, the, great, persecution, under, the, emperor, diocletian, ruled, 284, 305, but, was, released, under, the, orders, of, the, emperor, constantine, the, great, ruled, 306, 337, this, story, sounds, plausible, but, is, not, attested, in, the, earliest, sources, and, is, therefore, unlikely, to, be, historical, one, of, the, earliest, attested, stories, of, saint, nicholas, is, one, in, which, he, saves, three, innocent, men, from, execution, according, to, michael, the, archimandrite, three, innocent, men, were, condemned, to, death, by, the, governor, eustathius, as, they, were, about, to, be, executed, nicholas, appeared, pushed, the, executioner, s, sword, to, the, ground, released, them, from, their, chains, and, angrily, chastised, a, juror, who, had, accepted, a, bribe, according, to, jona, lendering, this, story, directly, parallels, an, earlier, story, in, philostratus, s, life, of, apollonius, of, tyana, in, which, apollonius, prevents, the, execution, of, a, man, falsely, condemned, of, banditry, michael, the, archimandrite, also, tells, another, story, in, which, the, consul, ablabius, accepted, a, bribe, to, put, three, famous, generals, to, death, in, spite, of, their, actual, innocence, saint, nicholas, appeared, to, constantine, and, ablabius, in, dreams, informing, constantine, of, the, truth, and, frightening, ablabius, into, releasing, the, generals, for, fear, of, hell, later, versions, of, the, story, are, more, elaborate, interweaving, the, two, stories, together, according, to, one, version, emperor, constantine, sent, three, of, his, most, trusted, generals, named, ursos, nepotianos, and, herpylion, to, put, down, a, rebellion, in, phrygia, however, a, storm, forced, them, to, take, refuge, in, myra, unbeknownst, to, the, generals, who, were, in, the, harbor, their, soldiers, further, inland, were, fighting, with, local, merchants, and, engaging, in, looting, and, destruction, nicholas, confronted, the, generals, for, allowing, their, soldiers, to, misbehave, and, the, generals, brought, an, end, to, the, looting, immediately, after, the, soldiers, had, returned, to, their, ships, nicholas, heard, word, of, the, three, innocent, men, about, to, be, executed, and, the, three, generals, aided, him, in, stopping, the, execution, eustathius, attempted, to, flee, on, his, horse, but, nicholas, stopped, his, horse, and, chastised, him, for, his, corruption, eustathius, under, the, threat, of, being, reported, directly, to, the, emperor, repented, of, his, corrupt, ways, afterward, the, generals, succeeded, in, ending, the, rebellion, and, were, promoted, by, constantine, to, even, higher, status, the, generals, enemies, however, slandered, them, to, the, consul, ablabius, telling, him, that, they, had, not, really, put, down, the, revolt, but, instead, encouraged, their, own, soldiers, to, join, it, the, generals, enemies, also, bribed, ablabius, and, he, had, the, three, generals, imprisoned, nicholas, then, made, his, dream, appearances, and, the, three, generals, were, set, free, in, 325, nicholas, is, said, to, have, attended, the, first, council, of, nicaea, where, he, is, said, to, have, been, a, staunch, opponent, of, arianism, and, a, devoted, supporter, of, trinitarianism, and, one, of, the, bishops, who, signed, the, nicene, creed, nicholas, s, attendance, at, the, council, of, nicaea, is, attested, early, by, theodore, the, lector, s, list, of, attendees, which, records, him, as, the, 151st, attendee, however, he, is, conspicuously, never, mentioned, by, athanasius, of, alexandria, the, foremost, defender, of, trinitarianism, at, the, council, who, knew, all, the, notable, bishops, of, the, period, nor, is, he, mentioned, by, the, historian, eusebius, who, was, also, present, at, the, council, adam, c, english, notes, that, lists, of, the, attendees, at, nicaea, vary, considerably, with, shorter, lists, only, including, roughly, 200, names, but, longer, lists, including, around, 300, saint, nicholas, s, name, only, appears, on, the, longer, lists, not, the, shorter, ones, nicholas, s, name, appears, on, a, total, of, three, early, lists, one, of, which, theodore, the, lector, is, generally, considered, to, be, the, most, accurate, according, to, jona, lendering, there, are, two, main, possibilities, a, later, legend, first, attested, in, the, fourteenth, century, over, 1, 000, years, after, nicholas, s, death, holds, that, during, the, council, of, nicaea, nicholas, lost, his, temper, and, slapped, a, certain, arian, across, the, face, on, account, of, this, constantine, revoked, nicholas, s, miter, and, pallium, steven, d, greydanus, concludes, that, because, of, the, story, s, late, attestation, it, has, no, historical, value, jona, lendering, however, defends, the, veracity, and, historicity, of, the, incident, arguing, that, as, it, was, embarrassing, and, reflects, poorly, on, nicholas, s, reputation, it, is, inexplicable, why, later, hagiographers, would, have, invented, it, later, versions, of, the, legend, embellish, it, making, the, heretic, arius, himself, and, having, nicholas, punch, him, rather, than, merely, slapping, him, with, his, open, hand, in, these, versions, of, the, story, nicholas, is, also, imprisoned, but, christ, and, the, virgin, mary, appear, to, him, in, his, cell, he, tells, them, he, is, imprisoned, for, loving, you, and, they, free, him, from, his, chains, and, restore, his, vestments, the, scene, of, nicholas, slapping, arius, is, celebrated, in, eastern, orthodox, icons, and, episodes, of, saint, nicholas, at, nicaea, are, shown, in, a, series, of, paintings, from, the, 1660s, in, the, basilica, di, san, nicola, in, bari, one, story, tells, how, during, a, terrible, famine, a, malicious, butcher, lured, three, little, children, into, his, house, where, he, killed, them, placing, their, remains, in, a, barrel, to, cure, planning, to, sell, them, off, as, ham, nicholas, visiting, the, region, to, care, for, the, hungry, saw, through, the, butcher, s, lies, and, resurrected, the, pickled, children, by, making, the, sign, of, the, cross, jona, lendering, opines, that, the, story, is, without, any, historical, value, adam, c, english, notes, that, the, story, of, the, resurrection, of, the, pickled, children, is, a, late, medieval, addition, to, the, legendary, biography, of, saint, nicholas, and, that, it, is, not, found, in, any, of, his, earliest, lives, although, this, story, seems, bizarre, and, horrifying, to, modern, audiences, it, was, tremendously, popular, throughout, the, late, middle, ages, and, the, early, modern, period, and, widely, beloved, by, ordinary, folk, it, is, depicted, in, stained, glass, windows, wood, panel, paintings, tapestries, and, frescoes, eventually, the, scene, became, so, widely, reproduced, that, rather, than, showing, the, whole, scene, artists, began, to, merely, depict, saint, nicholas, with, three, naked, children, and, a, wooden, barrel, at, his, feet, according, to, english, eventually, people, who, had, forgotten, or, never, learned, the, story, began, misinterpreting, representations, of, it, that, saint, nicholas, was, shown, with, children, led, people, to, conclude, he, was, the, patron, saint, of, children, meanwhile, the, fact, that, he, was, shown, with, a, barrel, led, people, to, conclude, that, he, was, the, patron, saint, of, brewers, according, to, another, story, during, a, great, famine, that, myra, experienced, in, 311, 312, a, ship, was, in, the, port, at, anchor, loaded, with, wheat, for, the, emperor, in, constantinople, nicholas, invited, the, sailors, to, unload, a, part, of, the, wheat, to, help, in, the, time, of, need, the, sailors, at, first, disliked, the, request, because, the, wheat, had, to, be, weighed, accurately, and, delivered, to, the, emperor, only, when, nicholas, promised, them, that, they, would, not, suffer, any, loss, for, their, consideration, did, the, sailors, agree, when, they, arrived, later, in, the, capital, they, made, a, surprising, find, the, weight, of, the, load, had, not, changed, although, the, wheat, removed, in, myra, was, enough, for, two, full, years, and, could, even, be, used, for, sowing, it, has, long, been, traditionally, assumed, that, saint, nicholas, was, originally, buried, in, his, home, town, of, myra, where, his, relics, are, later, known, to, have, been, kept, but, some, recent, archaeological, evidence, indicates, that, saint, nicholas, may, have, originally, been, entombed, in, a, rock, cut, church, located, at, the, highest, point, on, the, small, turkish, island, of, gemile, only, twenty, miles, away, from, his, birthplace, of, patara, nicholas, s, name, is, painted, on, part, of, the, ruined, building, in, antiquity, the, island, was, known, as, saint, nicholas, island, and, today, it, is, known, in, turkish, as, gemiler, adasi, meaning, island, of, boats, in, reference, to, saint, nicholas, s, traditional, role, as, the, patron, saint, of, seafarers, the, church, was, built, in, the, fourth, century, around, the, time, of, nicholas, s, death, and, is, typical, of, saints, shrines, from, that, time, period, nicholas, was, the, only, major, saint, associated, with, that, part, of, turkey, the, church, where, historians, believe, he, was, originally, entombed, is, at, the, western, end, of, the, great, processional, way, in, the, mid, 7th, century, gemile, was, vulnerable, to, attack, by, arab, fleets, so, nicholas, s, remains, appear, to, have, been, moved, from, the, island, to, the, city, of, myra, where, nicholas, had, served, as, bishop, for, most, of, his, life, myra, is, located, roughly, 40, km, 25, mi, east, of, gemile, and, its, location, further, inland, made, it, safer, from, seafaring, arab, forces, it, is, said, that, in, myra, the, relics, of, saint, nicholas, each, year, exuded, a, clear, watery, liquid, which, smelled, like, rose, water, called, manna, or, myrrh, which, was, believed, by, the, faithful, to, possess, miraculous, powers, as, it, was, widely, known, that, all, nicholas, s, relics, were, at, myra, in, their, sealed, sarcophagus, it, was, rare, during, this, period, for, forgers, of, relics, to, claim, to, possess, those, belonging, to, saint, nicholas, a, solemn, bronze, statue, of, the, saint, by, russian, sculptor, gregory, pototsky, was, donated, by, the, russian, government, in, 2000, and, was, given, a, prominent, place, in, the, square, fronting, the, medieval, church, of, st, nicholas, in, 2005, mayor, s, leyman, top, u, had, the, statue, replaced, by, a, red, suited, plastic, santa, claus, statue, because, he, wanted, an, image, more, recognisable, to, foreign, visitors, protests, from, the, russian, government, against, this, were, successful, and, the, bronze, statue, was, returned, albeit, without, its, original, high, pedestal, to, a, corner, nearer, the, church, on, 28, december, 2009, the, turkish, government, announced, that, it, would, be, formally, requesting, the, return, of, saint, nicholas, s, skeletal, remains, to, turkey, from, the, italian, government, turkish, authorities, asserted, that, nicholas, himself, desired, to, be, buried, at, his, episcopal, town, and, that, his, remains, were, illegally, removed, from, his, homeland, in, 2017, an, archaeological, survey, at, st, nicholas, church, demre, was, reported, to, have, found, a, temple, below, the, modern, church, with, excavation, work, to, be, done, that, will, allow, researchers, to, determine, whether, it, still, holds, nicholas, s, body, after, the, battle, of, manzikert, in, 1071, the, byzantine, empire, temporarily, lost, control, over, most, of, asia, minor, to, the, invading, seljuk, turks, and, so, greek, christians, of, myra, became, subjects, of, the, turks, at, the, same, time, the, catholic, church, in, the, west, had, declared, in, 1054, ad, that, the, greek, church, the, official, church, of, the, byzantine, empire, was, in, schism, because, of, the, many, wars, in, the, region, some, christians, were, concerned, that, access, to, the, tomb, might, become, difficult, taking, advantage, of, the, confusion, and, the, loss, by, the, greek, christian, community, of, myra, of, its, byzantine, imperial, protection, in, the, spring, of, 1087, italian, sailors, from, bari, in, apulia, seized, part, of, the, remains, of, the, saint, from, his, burial, church, in, myra, over, the, objections, of, the, greek, orthodox, monks, in, the, church, adam, c, english, describes, the, removal, of, the, relics, from, myra, as, essentially, a, holy, robbery, and, notes, the, thieves, were, not, only, afraid, of, being, caught, or, chased, after, by, the, locals, but, also, the, power, of, saint, nicholas, himself, returning, to, bari, they, brought, the, remains, with, them, and, cared, for, them, the, remains, arrived, on, 9, may, 1087, two, years, later, pope, urban, ii, inaugurated, a, new, church, the, basilica, di, san, nicola, to, saint, nicholas, in, bari, the, pope, himself, personally, placed, nicholas, s, relics, into, the, tomb, beneath, the, altar, of, the, new, church, the, removal, of, saint, nicholas, s, relics, from, myra, and, their, arrival, in, bari, is, reliably, recorded, by, multiple, chroniclers, including, orderic, vitalis, and, 9, may, continued, to, be, celebrated, every, year, by, western, christians, as, the, day, of, nicholas, s, translation, eastern, orthodox, christians, and, the, turks, have, both, long, regarded, the, unauthorized, removal, of, the, relics, from, myra, as, a, blatant, theft, but, the, people, of, bari, have, instead, maintained, that, it, was, a, rescue, mission, to, save, the, bones, from, the, turkish, invaders, a, legend, shown, on, the, ceiling, of, the, basilica, di, san, nicola, holds, that, nicholas, once, visited, bari, and, predicted, that, his, bones, would, one, day, rest, there, prior, to, the, translation, of, nicholas, s, relics, to, bari, his, following, had, been, known, in, western, europe, but, it, had, not, been, extremely, popular, in, autumn, of, 1096, norman, and, frankish, soldiers, mustered, in, bari, in, preparation, for, the, first, crusade, although, the, crusaders, generally, favored, warrior, saints, which, saint, nicholas, was, not, the, presence, of, his, relics, in, bari, made, him, materially, accessible, nicholas, s, associations, with, aiding, travelers, and, seafarers, also, made, him, a, popular, choice, for, veneration, nicholas, s, veneration, by, crusaders, helped, promote, his, following, throughout, western, europe, after, the, relics, were, brought, to, bari, they, continued, to, produce, myrrh, much, to, the, joy, of, their, new, owners, vials, of, myrrh, from, his, relics, have, been, taken, all, over, the, world, for, centuries, and, can, still, be, obtained, from, his, church, in, bari, even, up, to, the, present, day, a, flask, of, manna, is, extracted, from, the, tomb, of, saint, nicholas, every, year, on, 6, december, the, saint, s, feast, day, by, the, clergy, of, the, basilica, the, myrrh, is, collected, from, a, sarcophagus, which, is, located, in, the, basilica, vault, and, could, be, obtained, in, the, shop, nearby, the, liquid, gradually, seeps, out, of, the, tomb, but, it, is, unclear, whether, it, originates, from, the, body, within, the, tomb, or, from, the, marble, itself, since, the, town, of, bari, is, a, harbour, and, the, tomb, is, below, sea, level, there, have, been, several, natural, explanations, proposed, for, the, manna, fluid, including, the, transfer, of, seawater, to, the, tomb, by, capillary, action, in, 1966, a, vault, in, the, crypt, underneath, the, basilica, di, san, nicola, was, dedicated, as, an, orthodox, chapel, with, an, iconostasis, in, commemoration, of, the, recent, lifting, of, the, anathemas, the, roman, catholic, and, eastern, orthodox, churches, had, issued, against, each, other, during, the, great, schism, in, 1054, in, may, 2017, following, talks, between, pope, francis, and, russian, orthodox, patriarch, kirill, a, portion, of, the, relics, of, st, nicholas, in, bari, were, sent, on, loan, to, moscow, the, relic, was, on, display, for, veneration, at, christ, the, savior, cathedral, before, being, taken, to, saint, petersburg, in, mid, june, prior, to, returning, to, bari, more, than, a, million, people, lined, up, in, moscow, for, a, momentary, glimpse, of, the, gilded, ark, holding, one, of, the, saint, s, ribs, the, sailors, from, bari, took, only, the, main, bones, of, nicholas, s, skeleton, leaving, all, the, minor, fragments, in, the, grave, the, city, of, venice, had, interest, in, obtaining, the, remaining, fragments, of, his, skeleton, in, 1044, they, dedicated, the, san, nicol, al, lido, monastery, basilica, to, him, on, the, north, end, of, the, lido, di, venezia, according, to, a, single, chronicle, written, by, an, anonymous, monk, at, this, monastery, in, 1100, a, fleet, of, venetian, ships, accompanied, by, bishop, henri, sailed, past, myra, on, their, way, to, palestine, for, the, first, crusade, bishop, henri, insisted, for, the, fleet, to, turn, back, and, set, anchor, in, myra, the, venetians, took, the, remaining, bones, of, saint, nicholas, as, well, as, those, of, several, other, bishops, of, myra, from, the, church, there, which, was, only, guarded, by, four, orthodox, monks, and, brought, them, to, venice, where, they, deposited, them, in, the, san, nicol, al, lido, this, tradition, was, lent, credence, in, two, scientific, investigations, of, the, relics, in, bari, and, venice, which, confirmed, that, the, relics, in, the, two, cities, are, anatomically, compatible, and, may, belong, to, the, same, person, it, is, said, that, someone, dies, every, time, the, bones, of, saint, nicholas, in, venice, are, disturbed, the, last, time, the, bones, were, examined, was, in, july, 1992, because, of, nicholas, s, skeleton, s, long, confinement, in, myra, after, it, was, brought, to, bari, the, demand, for, pieces, of, it, rose, small, bones, quickly, began, to, disperse, across, western, europe, the, sailors, who, had, transported, the, bones, gave, one, tooth, and, two, fragments, chipped, from, nicholas, s, sarcophagus, to, the, norman, knight, william, pantulf, pantulf, took, these, relics, to, his, hometown, of, noron, in, normandy, where, they, were, placed, in, the, local, church, of, st, peter, in, june, 1092, in, 1096, the, duke, of, apulia, gave, several, bones, of, saint, nicholas, to, the, count, of, flanders, which, he, then, enshrined, in, the, abbey, of, watten, according, to, legend, in, 1101, saint, nicholas, appeared, in, a, vision, to, a, french, clerk, visiting, the, shrine, at, bari, and, told, him, to, take, one, of, his, bones, with, him, to, his, hometown, of, port, near, nancy, the, clerk, took, a, finger, bone, back, with, him, to, port, where, a, chapel, was, built, to, saint, nicholas, port, became, an, important, center, of, devotion, in, the, following, of, nicholas, and, in, the, fifteenth, century, a, church, known, as, the, basilique, saint, nicolas, was, built, there, dedicated, to, him, the, town, itself, is, now, known, as, saint, nicolas, de, port, in, honor, of, nicholas, the, clergy, at, bari, strategically, gave, away, samples, of, nicholas, s, bones, to, promote, the, following, and, enhance, its, prestige, many, of, these, bones, were, initially, kept, in, constantinople, but, after, the, sack, of, constantinople, in, 1204, during, the, fourth, crusade, these, fragments, were, scattered, across, western, europe, a, hand, claimed, to, belong, to, saint, nicholas, was, kept, in, the, san, nicola, in, carcere, in, rome, this, church, whose, name, means, saint, nicholas, in, chains, was, built, on, the, site, of, a, former, municipal, prison, stories, quickly, developed, about, nicholas, himself, having, been, held, in, that, prison, mothers, would, come, to, the, church, to, pray, to, saint, nicholas, for, their, jailed, sons, to, be, released, and, repentant, criminals, would, place, votive, offerings, in, the, church, as, a, result, of, this, nicholas, became, the, patron, saint, of, prisoners, and, those, falsely, accused, of, crimes, an, index, finger, claimed, to, belong, to, saint, nicholas, was, kept, in, a, chapel, along, the, ostian, way, in, rome, another, finger, was, held, in, ventimiglia, in, liguria, today, many, churches, in, europe, russia, and, the, united, states, claim, to, possess, small, relics, such, as, a, tooth, or, a, finger, bone, an, irish, tradition, states, that, the, relics, of, saint, nicholas, are, also, reputed, to, have, been, stolen, from, myra, by, local, norman, crusading, knights, in, the, twelfth, century, and, buried, near, thomastown, county, kilkenny, where, a, stone, slab, marks, the, site, locally, believed, to, be, his, grave, according, to, the, irish, antiquarian, john, hunt, the, tomb, probably, actually, belongs, to, a, local, priest, from, jerpoint, abbey, whereas, the, devotional, importance, of, relics, and, the, economics, associated, with, pilgrimages, caused, the, remains, of, most, saints, to, be, divided, up, and, spread, over, numerous, churches, in, several, countries, saint, nicholas, is, unusual, in, that, most, of, his, bones, have, been, preserved, in, one, spot, his, grave, crypt, in, bari, even, with, the, allegedly, continuing, miracle, of, the, manna, the, archdiocese, of, bari, has, allowed, for, one, scientific, survey, of, the, bones, in, the, late, 1950s, while, the, crypt, was, undergoing, much, needed, restoration, the, bones, were, removed, from, it, for, the, first, time, since, their, interment, in, 1089, a, special, pontiffical, commission, permitted, luigi, martino, a, professor, of, human, anatomy, at, the, university, of, bari, to, examine, the, bones, under, the, commission, s, supervision, martino, took, thousands, of, measurements, detailed, scientific, drawings, photographs, and, x, rays, these, examinations, revealed, the, saint, to, have, died, at, over, seventy, years, of, age, and, to, have, been, of, average, height, and, slender, to, average, build, he, also, suffered, from, severe, chronic, arthritis, in, his, spine, and, pelvis, in, 2004, at, the, university, of, manchester, researchers, caroline, wilkinson, and, fraco, introna, reconstructed, the, saint, s, face, based, on, martino, s, examination, the, review, of, the, data, revealed, that, the, historical, saint, nicholas, was, 5, ft, 6, in, 1, 68, m, in, height, and, had, a, broken, nose, which, had, partially, healed, revealing, that, the, injury, had, been, suffered, ante, mortem, the, broken, nose, appeared, to, conform, with, hagiographical, reports, that, saint, nicholas, had, been, beaten, and, tortured, during, the, diocletianic, persecution, the, facial, reconstruction, was, produced, by, caroline, wilkinson, at, the, university, of, manchester, and, was, shown, on, a, bbc2, tv, program, the, real, face, of, santa, in, 2014, the, face, lab, at, liverpool, john, moores, university, produced, an, updated, reconstruction, of, saint, nicholas, s, face, in, 2017, two, researchers, from, oxford, university, professor, tom, higham, and, doctor, georges, kazan, radiocarbon, dated, a, fragment, of, a, pelvis, claimed, to, belong, to, saint, nicholas, the, fragment, originally, came, from, a, church, in, lyon, france, and, at, the, time, of, testing, was, in, the, possession, of, father, dennis, o, neill, a, priest, from, st, martha, of, bethany, church, in, illinois, the, results, of, the, radiocarbon, dating, confirmed, that, the, pelvis, dates, to, the, fourth, century, ad, around, the, same, time, that, saint, nicholas, would, have, died, and, is, not, a, medieval, forgery, the, bone, was, one, of, the, oldest, the, oxford, team, had, ever, examined, according, to, professor, higham, most, of, the, relics, the, team, has, examined, turn, out, to, be, too, recent, to, have, actually, belonged, to, the, saint, to, whom, they, are, attributed, but, he, states, this, bone, fragment, in, contrast, suggests, that, we, could, possibly, be, looking, at, remains, from, st, nicholas, himself, kazan, believes, the, pelvis, fragment, may, come, from, the, same, individual, as, the, skeleton, divided, between, the, churches, in, bari, and, venice, since, the, bone, they, tested, comes, from, the, left, pubis, and, the, only, pelvis, bone, in, the, collection, at, bari, is, the, left, ilium, in, the, absence, of, dna, testing, however, it, is, not, yet, possible, to, know, for, certain, whether, the, pelvis, is, from, the, same, man, among, greeks, and, italians, he, is, a, favorite, of, sailors, fishermen, ships, and, sailing, as, a, result, and, over, time, he, has, become, the, patron, saint, of, several, cities, which, maintain, harbours, in, centuries, of, greek, folklore, nicholas, was, seen, as, the, lord, of, the, sea, often, described, by, modern, greek, scholars, as, a, kind, of, christianized, version, of, poseidon, in, modern, greece, he, is, still, easily, among, the, most, recognizable, saints, and, 6, december, finds, many, cities, celebrating, their, patron, saint, he, is, also, the, patron,

together, with, the, apostles, with, special, hymns, to, him, which, are, found, in, the, liturgical, book, known, as, the, octoechos, soon, after, the, transfer, of, saint, nicholas, s, relics, from, myra, to, bari, an, east, slavic, version, of, his, life, and, an, account, of, the, transfer, of, his, relics, were, written, by, a, contemporary, to, this, event, devotional, akathists, and, canons,

various, parts, of, christendom, with, a, popular, tradition, including, children, placing, their, shoes, in, the, foyer, for, saint, nicholas, to, deliver, presents, therein, santa, claus, evolved, from, dutch, traditions, regarding, saint, nicholas, sinterklaas, when, the, dutch, established, the, colony, of, new, amsterdam, they, brought, the, legend, and, traditions, of, sinterklaas, with,

three, slaughtered, children, he, resurrected, in, a, strange, twist, the, three, gold, balls, referring, to, the, dowry, affair, are, sometimes, metaphorically, interpreted, as, being, oranges, or, other, fruits, as, in, the, low, countries, in, medieval, times, oranges, most, frequently, came, from, spain, this, led, to, the, belief, that, the, saint, lives, in, spain, and, comes, to, visit,
