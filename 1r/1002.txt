thutmose, i, sometimes, read, as, thutmosis, or, tuthmosis, i, thothmes, in, older, history, works, in, latinized, greek, meaning, thoth, is, born, was, the, third, pharaoh, of, the, 18th, dynasty, of, egypt, he, received, the, throne, after, the, death, of, the, previous, king, amenhotep, i, during, his, reign, he, campaigned, deep, into, the, levant, and, nubia, pushing, the, borders, of, egypt, farther, than, ever, before, in, each, region, he, also, built, many, temples, in, egypt, and, a, tomb, for, himself, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, he, is, the, first, king, confirmed, to, have, done, this, though, amenhotep, i, may, have, preceded, him, thutmose, i, s, reign, is, generally, dated, to, 1506, 1493, bc, but, a, minority, of, scholars, who, think, that, astrological, observations, used, to, calculate, the, timeline, of, ancient, egyptian, records, and, thus, the, reign, of, thutmose, i, were, taken, from, the, city, of, memphis, rather, than, from, thebes, would, date, his, reign, to, 1526, 1513, bc, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, thutmose, ii, who, in, turn, was, succeeded, by, thutmose, ii, s, sister, hatshepsut, it, has, been, speculated, that, thutmose, s, father, was, amenhotep, i, his, mother, senseneb, was, of, non, royal, parentage, and, may, have, been, a, lesser, wife, or, concubine, queen, ahmose, who, held, the, title, of, great, royal, wife, of, thutmose, was, probably, the, daughter, of, ahmose, i, and, the, sister, of, amenhotep, i, but, she, was, never, called, king, s, daughter, so, there, is, some, doubt, about, this, and, some, historians, believe, she, was, thutmose, s, sister, assuming, she, was, related, to, amenhotep, one, might, speculate, that, she, was, married, to, thutmose, in, order, to, guarantee, succession, this, is, known, not, to, be, the, case, for, two, reasons, first, amenhotep, s, alabaster, bark, built, at, karnak, associates, amenhotep, s, name, with, thutmose, s, name, well, before, amenhotep, s, death, second, thutmose, s, first, born, son, with, ahmose, amenmose, was, apparently, born, long, before, thutmose, s, coronation, he, can, be, seen, on, a, stela, from, thutmose, s, fourth, regnal, year, hunting, near, memphis, and, he, became, the, great, army, commander, of, his, father, sometime, before, his, death, which, was, no, later, than, thutmose, s, own, death, in, his, 12th, regnal, year, thutmose, had, another, son, wadjmose, and, two, daughters, hatshepsut, and, nefrubity, by, ahmose, wadjmose, died, before, his, father, and, nefrubity, died, as, an, infant, thutmose, had, also, one, son, by, his, another, wife, mutnofret, who, was, likely, a, daughter, of, ahmose, i, and, a, sister, of, amenhotep, i, this, son, succeeded, him, as, thutmose, ii, whom, thutmose, i, married, to, his, daughter, hatshepsut, it, was, later, recorded, by, hatshepsut, that, thutmose, willed, the, kingship, to, both, thutmose, ii, and, hatshepsut, but, this, is, considered, propaganda, by, hatshepsut, s, supporters, to, legitimise, her, claim, to, the, throne, when, she, later, assumed, power, a, heliacal, rising, of, sothis, was, recorded, in, the, reign, of, thutmose, s, predecessor, amenhotep, i, which, has, been, dated, to, 1517, bc, assuming, the, observation, was, made, at, thebes, the, year, of, amenhotep, s, death, and, thutmose, s, subsequent, coronation, can, be, accordingly, derived, and, is, dated, to, 1506, bc, by, most, modern, scholars, but, if, the, observation, were, made, at, either, heliopolis, or, memphis, as, a, minority, of, scholars, argue, thutmose, would, have, been, crowned, in, 1526, bc, manetho, records, that, thutmose, i, s, reign, lasted, 12, years, and, 9, months, or, 13, years, as, a, certain, mephres, in, his, epitome, this, data, is, supported, by, two, dated, inscriptions, from, years, 8, and, 9, of, his, reign, bearing, his, cartouche, found, inscribed, on, a, stone, block, in, karnak, accordingly, thutmose, is, usually, given, a, reign, from, 1506, bc, to, 1493, bc, low, chronology, but, a, minority, of, scholars, date, it, from, 1526, bc, to, 1513, bc, high, chronology, upon, thutmose, s, coronation, nubia, rebelled, against, egyptian, rule, according, to, the, tomb, autobiography, of, ahmose, son, of, ebana, thutmose, traveled, up, the, nile, and, fought, in, the, battle, personally, killing, the, nubian, king, upon, victory, he, had, the, nubian, king, s, body, hung, from, the, prow, of, his, ship, before, he, returned, to, thebes, after, that, campaign, he, led, a, second, expedition, against, nubia, in, his, third, year, in, the, course, of, which, he, ordered, the, canal, at, the, first, cataract, which, had, been, built, under, sesostris, iii, of, the, 12th, dynasty, to, be, dredged, in, order, to, facilitate, easier, travel, upstream, from, egypt, to, nubia, this, helped, integrate, nubia, into, the, egyptian, empire, this, expedition, is, mentioned, in, two, separate, inscriptions, by, the, king, s, son, thure, year, 3, first, month, of, the, third, season, day, 22, under, the, majesty, of, the, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, aakheperre, who, is, given, life, his, majesty, commanded, to, dig, this, canal, after, he, found, it, stopped, up, with, stones, no, year, 3, first, month, of, the, third, season, day, 22, his, majesty, sailed, this, canal, in, victory, and, in, the, power, of, his, return, from, overthrowing, the, wretched, kush, in, the, second, year, of, thutmose, s, reign, the, king, cut, a, stele, at, tombos, which, records, that, he, built, a, fortress, at, tombos, near, the, third, cataract, thus, permanently, extending, the, egyptian, military, presence, which, had, previously, stopped, at, buhen, at, the, second, cataract, thutmose, s, tombos, stele, indicates, that, he, had, already, fought, a, campaign, in, syria, hence, his, syrian, campaign, may, be, placed, at, the, beginning, of, his, second, regnal, year, this, second, campaign, was, the, farthest, north, any, egyptian, ruler, had, ever, campaigned, although, it, has, not, been, found, in, modern, times, he, apparently, set, up, a, stele, when, he, crossed, the, euphrates, river, during, this, campaign, the, syrian, princes, declared, allegiance, to, thutmose, but, after, he, returned, they, discontinued, tribute, and, began, fortifying, against, future, incursions, thutmose, celebrated, his, victories, with, an, elephant, hunt, in, the, area, of, niy, near, apamea, in, syria, and, returned, to, egypt, with, strange, tales, of, the, euphrates, that, inverted, water, which, flows, upstream, when, it, ought, to, be, flowing, downstream, the, euphrates, was, the, first, major, river, the, egyptians, had, ever, encountered, that, flowed, from, the, north, which, was, downstream, on, the, nile, to, the, south, upstream, on, the, nile, thus, the, river, became, known, in, egypt, as, simply, inverted, water, textual, sources, from, the, time, of, thutmose, i, include, references, to, retenu, naharin, and, the, land, of, mitanni, the, last, is, believed, to, be, the, first, historical, reference, to, that, kingdom, many, levantine, sites, were, destroyed, in, the, middle, of, the, 16th, century, b, c, and, these, destructions, have, often, been, attributed, to, the, military, campaigns, of, thutmose, i, or, of, his, predecessor, amenhotep, i, initially, these, campaigns, may, have, aimed, at, defeating, the, power, of, the, hyksos, who, were, formerly, strong, in, this, area, as, many, as, 20, sites, in, the, levant, suffered, destruction, at, this, time, for, example, the, fiery, destruction, of, stratum, xviii, at, gezer, has, been, assigned, to, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, bce, the, time, of, amenhotep, i, and, thutmose, i, based, on, the, pottery, and, scarabs, discovered, in, the, destruction, debris, it, does, not, appear, that, the, egyptians, aim, at, this, stage, was, to, control, the, area, permanently, because, they, established, no, permanent, presence, in, the, area, this, happened, later, during, the, 18th, dynasty, thutmose, had, to, face, one, more, military, threat, another, rebellion, by, nubia, in, his, fourth, year, his, influence, accordingly, expanded, even, farther, south, as, an, inscription, dated, to, his, reign, has, been, found, as, far, south, as, kurgus, south, of, the, fourth, cataract, he, inscribed, a, large, tableau, on, the, hagar, el, merwa, a, quartz, outcrop, c, 40m, long, and, 50m, wide, 1200, meters, from, the, nile, on, top, of, several, local, inscriptions, this, is, the, furthest, south, the, egyptian, presence, is, attested, during, his, reign, he, initiated, a, number, of, projects, that, effectively, ended, nubian, independence, for, 500, years, he, enlarged, a, temple, to, sesostris, iii, and, khnum, opposite, the, nile, from, semna, there, are, also, records, of, specific, religious, rites, the, viceroy, of, el, kab, was, to, have, performed, in, the, temples, in, nubia, in, proxy, for, the, king, he, also, appointed, a, man, called, turi, to, the, position, of, viceroy, of, kush, also, known, as, the, king, s, son, of, cush, with, a, civilian, representative, of, the, king, permanently, established, in, nubia, nubia, did, not, dare, revolt, as, often, as, it, had, and, was, easily, controlled, by, future, egyptian, kings, thutmose, i, organized, great, building, projects, during, his, reign, including, many, temples, and, tombs, but, his, greatest, projects, were, at, the, temple, of, karnak, under, the, supervision, of, the, architect, ineni, before, thutmose, karnak, probably, consisted, only, of, a, long, road, to, a, central, platform, with, a, number, of, shrines, for, the, solar, bark, along, the, side, of, the, road, thutmose, was, the, first, king, to, drastically, enlarge, the, temple, he, had, the, fifth, pylon, built, along, the, temple, s, main, road, along, with, a, wall, around, the, inner, sanctuary, and, two, flagpoles, to, flank, the, gateway, outside, of, this, he, built, a, fourth, pylon, and, another, enclosure, wall, between, pylons, four, and, five, he, had, a, hypostyle, hall, constructed, with, columns, made, of, cedar, wood, this, type, of, structure, was, common, in, ancient, egyptian, temples, and, supposedly, represents, a, papyrus, marsh, an, egyptian, symbol, of, creation, along, the, edge, of, this, room, he, built, colossal, statues, each, one, alternating, wearing, the, crown, of, upper, egypt, and, the, crown, of, lower, egypt, finally, outside, of, the, fourth, pylon, he, erected, four, more, flagpoles, and, two, obelisks, although, one, of, them, which, now, has, fallen, was, not, inscribed, until, thutmose, iii, inscribed, it, about, 50, years, later, the, cedar, columns, in, thutmose, i, s, hypostyle, hall, were, replaced, with, stone, columns, by, thutmose, iii, but, at, least, the, northernmost, two, were, replaced, by, thutmose, i, himself, hatshepsut, also, erected, two, of, her, own, obelisks, inside, thutmose, i, s, hypostyle, hall, in, addition, to, karnak, thutmose, i, also, built, statues, of, the, ennead, at, abydos, buildings, at, armant, ombos, el, hiba, memphis, and, edfu, as, well, as, minor, expansions, to, buildings, in, nubia, at, semna, buhen, aniba, and, quban, thutmose, i, was, the, first, king, who, definitely, was, buried, in, the, valley, of, the, kings, ineni, was, commissioned, to, dig, this, tomb, and, presumably, to, build, his, mortuary, temple, his, mortuary, temple, has, not, been, found, possibly, because, it, was, incorporated, into, or, demolished, by, the, construction, of, hatshepsut, s, mortuary, temple, at, deir, el, bahri, his, tomb, however, has, been, identified, as, kv38, in, it, was, found, a, yellow, quartzite, sarcophagus, bearing, the, name, of, thutmose, i, but, thutmose, iii, may, have, moved, his, body, into, the, tomb, of, hatshepsut, kv20, which, also, contains, a, sarcophagus, with, the, name, of, thutmose, i, on, it, thutmose, i, was, originally, buried, and, then, reburied, in, kv20, in, a, double, burial, with, his, daughter, hatshepsut, rather, than, kv38, which, could, only, have, been, built, for, thutmose, i, during, the, reign, of, his, grandson, thutmose, iii, based, on, a, recent, re, examination, of, the, architecture, and, contents, of, kv38, the, location, of, kv20, if, not, its, original, owner, had, been, known, since, the, napoleonic, expedition, of, 1799, and, in, 1844, the, prussian, scholar, karl, richard, lepsius, had, partially, explored, its, upper, passage, but, all, its, passageways, had, become, blocked, by, a, solidified, mass, of, rubble, small, stones, and, rubbish, which, had, been, carried, into, the, tomb, by, floodwaters, and, only, during, the, 1903, 04, excavation, season, did, howard, carter, after, two, previous, seasons, of, strenuous, work, clear, its, corridors, and, enter, its, double, burial, chamber, here, among, the, debris, of, broken, pottery, and, shattered, stone, vessels, from, the, burial, chamber, and, lower, passages, were, the, remnants, of, two, vases, made, for, queen, ahmose, nefertari, which, formed, part, of, thutmose, i, s, original, funerary, equipment, one, of, the, vases, contained, a, secondary, inscription, that, says, that, thutmose, ii, made, it, as, his, monument, to, his, father, other, vessels, that, bore, thutmose, i, s, names, and, titles, had, also, been, inscribed, by, his, son, and, successor, thutmose, ii, along, with, fragments, of, stone, vessels, made, for, hatshepsut, before, she, herself, became, king, as, well, as, other, vessels, that, bore, her, royal, name, of, maatkare, which, would, have, been, made, only, after, she, took, the, throne, but, carter, also, discovered, two, separate, coffins, in, the, burial, chamber, hatshepsut, s, beautifully, carved, sarcophagus, was, discovered, open, with, no, sign, of, a, body, and, with, the, lid, lying, discarded, on, the, floor, it, is, now, housed, in, the, cairo, museum, along, with, a, matching, yellow, quartzite, canopic, chest, a, second, sarcophagus, was, found, lying, on, its, side, with, its, almost, undamaged, lid, propped, against, the, wall, nearby, it, was, eventually, presented, to, theodore, m, davis, the, excavation, s, financial, sponsor, as, a, gesture, of, appreciation, for, his, support, davis, in, turn, presented, it, to, the, museum, of, fine, arts, boston, the, second, quartzite, sarcophagus, had, originally, been, engraved, with, the, name, of, the, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, maatkare, hatshepsut, but, when, it, was, complete, hatshepsut, decided, to, commission, an, entirely, new, sarcophagus, for, herself, and, donated, the, existing, finished, sarcophagus, to, her, father, thutmose, i, the, stonemasons, then, attempted, to, erase, the, original, carvings, by, restoring, the, surface, of, the, quartzite, so, that, it, could, be, re, carved, with, the, name, and, titles, of, tuthmose, i, instead, this, quartzite, sarcophagus, measures, 7, feet, long, by, 3, feet, wide, with, walls, 5, inches, thick, and, bears, a, dedication, text, that, records, hatshepsut, s, generosity, towards, her, father, long, live, the, female, horus, the, king, of, upper, and, lower, egypt, maatkare, the, son, of, re, hatshepsut, khnemet, amun, may, she, live, forever, she, made, it, as, her, monument, to, her, father, whom, she, loved, the, good, god, lord, of, the, two, lands, aakheperkare, the, son, of, re, thutmosis, the, justified, thutmose, i, was, not, destined, to, lie, alongside, his, daughter, after, hatshepsut, s, death, thutmose, iii, hatshepsut, s, successor, decided, to, reinter, his, grandfather, in, an, even, more, magnificent, tomb, kv38, featuring, another, yellow, sarcophagus, dedicated, to, thutmose, i, and, inscribed, with, texts, that, proclaim, this, pharaoh, s, love, for, his, deceased, grandfather, unfortunately, thutmose, i, s, remains, were, disturbed, late, during, the, 20th, dynasty, when, kv38, was, plundered, the, sarcophagus, s, lid, was, broken, and, all, this, king, s, valuable, precious, jewelry, and, grave, goods, were, stolen, thutmose, i, s, mummy, was, discovered, in, the, deir, el, bahri, cache, above, the, mortuary, temple, of, hatshepsut, revealed, in, 1881, it, had, been, interred, along, with, those, of, the, 18th, and, 19th, dynasty, leaders, ahmose, i, amenhotep, i, thutmose, ii, thutmose, iii, ramesses, i, seti, i, ramesses, ii, and, ramesses, ix, as, well, as, the, 21st, dynasty, pharaohs, pinedjem, i, pinedjem, ii, and, siamun, thutmose, i, s, original, coffin, was, taken, over, and, reused, by, a, later, pharaoh, of, the, 21st, dynasty, the, mummy, of, thutmose, i, was, thought, to, be, lost, but, egyptologist, gaston, maspero, largely, on, the, strength, of, familial, resemblance, to, the, mummies, of, thutmose, ii, and, thutmose, iii, believed, he, had, found, his, mummy, in, the, otherwise, unlabelled, mummy, 5283, this, identification, has, been, supported, by, subsequent, examinations, revealing, that, the, embalming, techniques, used, came, from, the, appropriate, period, of, time, almost, certainly, after, that, of, ahmose, i, and, made, during, the, 18th, dynasty, gaston, maspero, described, the, mummy, as, follows, the, king, was, already, advanced, in, age, at, the, time, of, his, death, being, over, fifty, years, old, to, judge, by, the, incisor, teeth, which, are, worn, and, corroded, by, the, impurities, of, which, the, egyptian, bread, was, full, the, body, though, small, and, emaciated, shows, evidence, of, unusual, muscular, strength, the, head, is, bald, the, features, are, refined, and, the, mouth, still, bears, an, expression, characteristic, of, shrewdness, and, cunning, james, harris, and, fawzia, hussien, 1991, conducted, an, x, ray, survey, on, new, kingdom, royal, mummies, and, examined, thutmose, i, s, mummified, remains, the, study, found, that, thutmose, i, s, mummy, had, all, the, craniofacial, characteristics, common, among, nubian, populations, and, a, typical, nubian, morphology, a, 2020, genetic, study, performed, by, a, team, under, zahi, hawass, on, the, amarna, royal, mummies, also, featured, the, unidentified, royal, mummy, previously, thought, to, be, thutmose, i, in, the, control, samples, the, study, indicated, that, the, mummy, belonged, to, haplogroup, l, which, is, mainly, observed, in, southern, western, and, central, asia, highest, in, the, indian, subcontinent, what, was, thought, to, be, his, mummy, could, be, viewed, in, the, egyptian, museum, in, cairo, but, in, 2007, hawass, announced, that, the, mummy, previously, thought, to, be, thutmose, i, is, that, of, a, 30, year, old, man, who, died, as, a, result, of, an, arrow, wound, to, the, chest, because, of, the, young, age, of, the, mummy, and, the, cause, of, death, it, was, determined, that, the, mummy, was, probably, not, that, of, thutmose, i, the, mummy, has, the, inventory, number, cg, 61065, in, april, 2021, the, mummy, was, moved, to, the, national, museum, of, egyptian, civilization, along, with, those, of, 17, kings, and, four, queens, in, an, event, termed, the, pharaohs, golden, parade
