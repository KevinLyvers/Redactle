and, schmidt, would, only, determine, its, full, structure, much, later, roberts, by, then, thatcher, learned, this, in, the, 1960s, while, visiting, the, weizmann, institute, where, her, former,

correspond, into, the, 1980s, and, roberts, in, her, memoirs, would, describe, her, mentor, as, ever, helpful, a, brilliant, scientist, and, a, gifted, teacher, as, prime, minister, she, would, keep, a, portrait, of, hodgkin, at, 10, downing, street, later, in, life, she, was, reportedly, prouder, of, becoming, the, first, prime, minister, with, a, science, degree, than, becoming, the, first,

her, time, at, oxford, roberts, was, noted, for, her, isolated, and, serious, attitude, her, first, boyfriend, tony, bray, 1926, 2014, recalled, that, she, was, very, thoughtful, and, a, very, good, conversationalist, that, s, probably, what, interested, me, she, was, good, at, general, subjects, roberts, s, coursework, involved, subjects, beyond, chemistry, as, she, was, already, contemplating, an, entry, into, law, and, politics, her, enthusiasm, for, politics, as, a, girl, made, bray, think, of, her, as, unusual, and, her, parents, as, slightly, austere, and, very, proper, roberts, became, president, of, the, oxford, university, conservative, association, in, 1946, she, was, influenced, at, university, by, political, works, such, as, friedrich, hayek, s, the, road, to, serfdom, 1944, which, condemned, economic, intervention, by, government, as, a, precursor, to, an, authoritarian, state, after, graduating, roberts, secured, a, position, as, a, research, chemist, for, british, xylonite, bx, plastics, following, a, series, of, interviews, arranged, by, oxford, she, subsequently, moved, to, colchester, in, essex, to, work, at, the, firm, little, is, known, about, her, brief, time, there, by, her, own, account, she, was, initially, enthusiastic, about, the, position, as, she, had, been, intended, to, function, as, a, personal, assistant, to, the, company, s, head, of, research, and, development, providing, opportunities, to, learn, about, operations, management, but, on, my, arrival, it, was, decided, that, there, was, not, enough, to, do, in, that, capacity, instead, she, seems, to, have, researched, methods, of, attaching, polyvinyl, chloride, pvc, to, metals, while, with, the, firm, she, joined, the, association, of, scientific, workers, in, 1948, she, applied, for, a, job, at, imperial, chemical, industries, ici, but, was, rejected, after, the, personnel, department, assessed, her, as, headstrong, obstinate, and, dangerously, self, opinionated, jon, agar, in, notes, and, records, argues, that, her, understanding, of, modern, scientific, research, later, impacted, her, views, as, prime, minister, roberts, joined, the, local, conservative, association, and, attended, the, party, conference, at, llandudno, wales, in, 1948, as, a, representative, of, the, university, graduate, conservative, association, meanwhile, she, became, a, high, ranking, affiliate, of, the, vermin, club, a, group, of, grassroots, conservatives, formed, in, response, to, a, derogatory, comment, made, by, aneurin, bevan, one, of, her, oxford, friends, was, also, a, friend, of, the, chair, of, the, dartford, conservative, association, in, kent, who, were, looking, for, candidates, officials, of, the, association, were, so, impressed, by, her, that, they, asked, her, to, apply, even, though, she, was, not, on, the, party, s, approved, list, she, was, selected, in, january, 1950, aged, 24, and, added, to, the, approved, list, post, ante, at, a, dinner, following, her, formal, adoption, as, conservative, candidate, for, dartford, in, february, 1949, she, met, divorc, denis, thatcher, a, successful, and, wealthy, businessman, who, drove, her, to, her, essex, train, after, their, first, meeting, she, described, him, to, muriel, as, not, a, very, attractive, creature, very, reserved, but, quite, nice, in, preparation, for, the, election, roberts, moved, to, dartford, while, she, supported, herself, by, working, as, a, research, chemist, for, j, lyons, and, co, in, hammersmith, reportedly, as, part, of, a, team, developing, emulsifiers, for, ice, cream, as, the, work, was, more, theoretical, in, nature, than, during, her, prior, role, with, bx, plastics, roberts, found, it, more, satisfying, while, at, lyons, she, worked, under, the, supervision, of, hans, jellinek, who, headed, the, company, s, physical, chemistry, section, jellinek, assigned, her, to, research, the, saponification, of, monostearin, glycerol, monostearate, which, has, properties, as, an, emulsifier, stabiliser, and, food, preservative, agar, has, noted, the, research, may, have, been, connected, with, the, emulsification, of, ice, cream, but, only, as, a, possibility, in, september, 1951, their, research, was, published, in, the, journal, of, the, science, of, food, and, agriculture, a, recently, launched, publication, of, the, society, of, chemical, industry, as, the, saponification, of, monostearin, in, a, monolayer, this, would, be, roberts, s, sole, scientific, publication, in, 1979, following, his, former, assistant, s, election, as, prime, minister, jellinek, by, then, a, professor, of, physical, chemistry, at, clarkson, university, in, the, united, states, said, she, had, done, a, very, good, job, on, the, project, showing, great, determination, she, sent, jellinek, a, congratulatory, letter, upon, his, retirement, in, 1984, and, another, letter, shortly, before, his, death, two, years, later, roberts, married, at, wesley, s, chapel, and, her, children, were, baptised, there, but, she, and, her, husband, began, attending, church, of, england, services, and, would, later, convert, to, anglicanism, in, the, 1950, and, 1951, general, elections, roberts, was, the, conservative, candidate, for, the, labour, seat, of, dartford, the, local, party, selected, her, as, its, candidate, because, though, not, a, dynamic, public, speaker, roberts, was, well, prepared, and, fearless, in, her, answers, a, prospective, candidate, bill, deedes, recalled, once, she, opened, her, mouth, the, rest, of, us, began, to, look, rather, second, rate, she, attracted, media, attention, as, the, youngest, and, the, only, female, candidate, in, 1950, she, was, the, youngest, conservative, candidate, in, the, country, she, lost, on, both, occasions, to, norman, dodds, but, reduced, the, labour, majority, by, 6, 000, and, then, a, further, 1, 000, during, the, campaigns, she, was, supported, by, her, parents, and, by, her, future, husband, denis, thatcher, whom, she, married, in, december, 1951, denis, funded, his, wife, s, studies, for, the, bar, she, qualified, as, a, barrister, in, 1953, and, specialised, in, taxation, later, that, same, year, their, twins, carol, and, mark, were, born, delivered, prematurely, by, caesarean, section, in, 1954, thatcher, was, defeated, when, she, sought, selection, to, be, the, conservative, party, candidate, for, the, orpington, by, election, of, january, 1955, she, chose, not, to, stand, as, a, candidate, in, the, 1955, general, election, in, later, years, stating, i, really, just, felt, the, twins, were, only, two, i, really, felt, that, it, was, too, soon, i, couldn, t, do, that, afterwards, thatcher, began, looking, for, a, conservative, safe, seat, and, was, selected, as, the, candidate, for, finchley, in, april, 1958, narrowly, beating, ian, montagu, fraser, she, was, elected, as, mp, for, the, seat, after, a, hard, campaign, in, the, 1959, election, benefiting, from, her, fortunate, result, in, a, lottery, for, backbenchers, to, propose, new, legislation, thatcher, s, maiden, speech, was, unusually, in, support, of, her, private, member, s, bill, the, public, bodies, admission, to, meetings, act, 1960, requiring, local, authorities, to, hold, their, council, meetings, in, public, the, bill, was, successful, and, became, law, in, 1961, she, went, against, the, conservative, party, s, official, position, by, voting, for, the, restoration, of, birching, as, a, judicial, corporal, punishment, thatcher, s, talent, and, drive, caused, her, to, be, mentioned, as, a, future, prime, minister, in, her, early, 20s, although, she, herself, was, more, pessimistic, stating, as, late, as, 1970, there, will, not, be, a, woman, prime, minister, in, my, lifetime, the, male, population, is, too, prejudiced, in, october, 1961, she, was, promoted, to, the, frontbench, as, parliamentary, secretary, to, the, ministry, for, pensions, by, harold, macmillan, thatcher, was, the, youngest, woman, in, history, to, receive, such, a, post, and, among, the, first, mps, elected, in, 1959, to, be, promoted, after, the, conservatives, lost, the, 1964, election, she, became, spokeswoman, on, housing, and, land, in, that, position, she, advocated, her, party, s, policy, of, giving, tenants, the, right, to, buy, their, council, houses, she, moved, to, the, shadow, treasury, team, in, 1966, and, as, treasury, spokeswoman, opposed, labour, s, mandatory, price, and, income, controls, arguing, they, would, unintentionally, produce, effects, that, would, distort, the, economy, jim, prior, suggested, thatcher, as, a, shadow, cabinet, member, after, the, conservatives, 1966, defeat, but, party, leader, edward, heath, and, chief, whip, william, whitelaw, eventually, chose, mervyn, pike, as, the, conservative, shadow, cabinet, s, sole, woman, member, at, the, 1966, conservative, party, conference, thatcher, criticised, the, high, tax, policies, of, the, labour, government, as, being, steps, not, only, towards, socialism, but, towards, communism, arguing, that, lower, taxes, served, as, an, incentive, to, hard, work, thatcher, was, one, of, the, few, conservative, mps, to, support, leo, abse, s, bill, to, decriminalise, male, homosexuality, she, voted, in, favour, of, david, steel, s, bill, to, legalise, abortion, as, well, as, a, ban, on, hare, coursing, she, supported, the, retention, of, capital, punishment, and, voted, against, the, relaxation, of, divorce, laws, in, 1967, the, united, states, embassy, chose, thatcher, to, take, part, in, the, international, visitor, leadership, program, then, called, the, foreign, leader, program, a, professional, exchange, programme, that, allowed, her, to, spend, about, six, weeks, visiting, various, us, cities, and, political, figures, as, well, as, institutions, such, as, the, international, monetary, fund, although, she, was, not, yet, a, shadow, cabinet, member, the, embassy, reportedly, described, her, to, the, state, department, as, a, possible, future, prime, minister, the, description, helped, thatcher, meet, with, prominent, people, during, a, busy, itinerary, focused, on, economic, issues, including, paul, samuelson, walt, rostow, pierre, paul, schweitzer, and, nelson, rockefeller, following, the, visit, heath, appointed, thatcher, to, the, shadow, cabinet, as, fuel, and, power, spokeswoman, before, the, 1970, general, election, she, was, promoted, to, shadow, transport, spokeswoman, and, later, to, education, in, 1968, enoch, powell, delivered, his, rivers, of, blood, speech, in, which, he, strongly, criticised, commonwealth, immigration, to, the, united, kingdom, and, the, then, proposed, race, relations, bill, when, heath, telephoned, thatcher, to, inform, her, that, he, would, sack, powell, from, the, shadow, cabinet, she, recalled, that, she, really, thought, that, it, was, better, to, let, things, cool, down, for, the, present, rather, than, heighten, the, crisis, she, believed, that, his, main, points, about, commonwealth, immigration, were, correct, and, that, the, selected, quotations, from, his, speech, had, been, taken, out, of, context, in, a, 1991, interview, for, today, thatcher, stated, that, she, thought, powell, had, made, a, valid, argument, if, in, sometimes, regrettable, terms, around, this, time, she, gave, her, first, commons, speech, as, a, shadow, transport, minister, and, highlighted, the, need, for, investment, in, british, rail, she, argued, f, we, build, bigger, and, better, roads, they, would, soon, be, saturated, with, more, vehicles, and, we, would, be, no, nearer, solving, the, problem, thatcher, made, her, first, visit, to, the, soviet, union, in, the, summer, of, 1969, as, the, opposition, transport, spokeswoman, and, in, october, delivered, a, speech, celebrating, her, ten, years, in, parliament, in, early, 1970, she, told, the, finchley, press, that, she, would, like, to, see, a, reversal, of, the, permissive, society, the, conservative, party, led, by, edward, heath, won, the, 1970, general, election, and, thatcher, was, appointed, to, the, cabinet, as, secretary, of, state, for, education, and, science, thatcher, caused, controversy, when, after, only, a, few, days, in, office, she, withdrew, labour, s, circular, 10, 65, which, attempted, to, force, comprehensivisation, without, going, through, a, consultation, process, she, was, highly, criticised, for, the, speed, at, which, she, carried, this, out, consequently, she, drafted, her, own, new, policy, circular, 10, 70, which, ensured, that, local, authorities, were, not, forced, to, go, comprehensive, her, new, policy, was, not, meant, to, stop, the, development, of, new, comprehensives, she, said, we, shall, expect, plans, to, be, based, on, educational, considerations, rather, than, on, the, comprehensive, principle, thatcher, supported, lord, rothschild, s, 1971, proposal, for, market, forces, to, affect, government, funding, of, research, although, many, scientists, opposed, the, proposal, her, research, background, probably, made, her, sceptical, of, their, claim, that, outsiders, should, not, interfere, with, funding, the, department, evaluated, proposals, for, more, local, education, authorities, to, close, grammar, schools, and, to, adopt, comprehensive, secondary, education, although, thatcher, was, committed, to, a, tiered, secondary, modern, grammar, school, system, of, education, and, attempted, to, preserve, grammar, schools, during, her, tenure, as, education, secretary, she, turned, down, only, 326, of, 3, 612, proposals, roughly, 9, per, cent, for, schools, to, become, comprehensives, the, proportion, of, pupils, attending, comprehensive, schools, consequently, rose, from, 32, per, cent, to, 62, per, cent, nevertheless, she, managed, to, save, 94, grammar, schools, during, her, first, months, in, office, she, attracted, public, attention, due, to, the, government, s, attempts, to, cut, spending, she, gave, priority, to, academic, needs, in, schools, while, administering, public, expenditure, cuts, on, the, state, education, system, resulting, in, the, abolition, of, free, milk, for, schoolchildren, aged, seven, to, eleven, she, held, that, few, children, would, suffer, if, schools, were, charged, for, milk, but, agreed, to, provide, younger, children, with, 0, 3, imperial, pints, 0, 17, l, daily, for, nutritional, purposes, she, also, argued, that, she, was, simply, carrying, on, with, what, the, labour, government, had, started, since, they, had, stopped, giving, free, milk, to, secondary, schools, milk, would, still, be, provided, to, those, children, that, required, it, on, medical, grounds, and, schools, could, still, sell, milk, the, aftermath, of, the, milk, row, hardened, her, determination, she, told, the, editor, proprietor, harold, creighton, of, the, spectator, don, t, underestimate, me, i, saw, how, they, broke, keith, but, they, won, t, break, me, cabinet, papers, later, revealed, that, she, opposed, the, policy, but, had, been, forced, into, it, by, the, treasury, her, decision, provoked, a, storm, of, protest, from, labour, and, the, press, leading, to, her, being, notoriously, nicknamed, margaret, thatcher, milk, snatcher, she, reportedly, considered, leaving, politics, in, the, aftermath, and, later, wrote, in, her, autobiography, i, learned, a, valuable, lesson, i, had, incurred, the, maximum, of, political, odium, for, the, minimum, of, political, benefit, the, heath, government, continued, to, experience, difficulties, with, oil, embargoes, and, union, demands, for, wage, increases, in, 1973, subsequently, losing, the, february, 1974, general, election, labour, formed, a, minority, government, and, went, on, to, win, a, narrow, majority, in, the, october, 1974, general, election, heath, s, leadership, of, the, conservative, party, looked, increasingly, in, doubt, thatcher, was, not, initially, seen, as, the, obvious, replacement, but, she, eventually, became, the, main, challenger, promising, a, fresh, start, her, main, support, came, from, the, parliamentary, 1922, committee, and, the, spectator, but, thatcher, s, time, in, office, gave, her, the, reputation, of, a, pragmatist, rather, than, that, of, an, ideologue, she, defeated, heath, on, the, first, ballot, and, he, resigned, from, the, leadership, in, the, second, ballot, she, defeated, whitelaw, heath, s, preferred, successor, thatcher, s, election, had, a, polarising, effect, on, the, party, her, support, was, stronger, among, mps, on, the, right, and, also, among, those, from, southern, england, and, those, who, had, not, attended, public, schools, or, oxbridge, thatcher, became, conservative, party, leader, and, leader, of, the, opposition, on, 11, february, 1975, she, appointed, whitelaw, as, her, deputy, heath, was, never, reconciled, to, thatcher, s, leadership, of, the, party, television, critic, clive, james, writing, in, the, observer, prior, to, her, election, as, conservative, party, leader, compared, her, voice, of, 1973, to, a, cat, sliding, down, a, blackboard, thatcher, had, already, begun, to, work, on, her, presentation, on, the, advice, of, gordon, reece, a, former, television, producer, by, chance, reece, met, the,

think, tank, founded, by, hayekian, poultry, magnate, antony, fisher, she, had, been, visiting, the, iea, and, reading, its, publications, since, the, early, 1960s, there, she, was, influenced, by, the, ideas, of, ralph, harris, and, arthur, seldon, and, became, the, face, of, the, ideological, movement, opposing, the, british, welfare, state, keynesian, economics, they, believed, was,

ideas, at, home, and, abroad, despite, setting, the, direction, of, her, foreign, policy, for, a, conservative, government, thatcher, was, distressed, by, her, repeated, failure, to, shine, in, the, house, of, commons, consequently, thatcher, decided, that, as, her, voice, was, carrying, little, weight, at, home, she, would, be, heard, in, the, wider, world, thatcher, undertook, visits, across, the, atlantic, establishing, an, international, profile, and, promoting, her, economic, and, foreign, policies, she, toured, the, united, states, in, 1975, and, met, president, gerald, ford, visiting,

without, being, accompanied, by, her, shadow, foreign, secretary, reginald, maudling, in, an, attempt, to, make, a, bolder, personal, impact, in, domestic, affairs, thatcher, opposed, scottish, devolution, home, rule, and, the, creation, of, a, scottish, assembly, she, instructed, conservative, mps, to, vote, against, the, scotland, and, wales, bill, in, december, 1976, which, was, successfully, defeated, and, then, when, new, bills, were, proposed, she, supported, amending, the, legislation, to, allow, the, english, to, vote, in, the, 1979, referendum, on, scottish, devolution, britain, s, economy, during, the, 1970s, was, so, weak, that, then, foreign, secretary, james, callaghan, warned, his, fellow, labour, cabinet, members, in, 1974, of, the, possibility, of, a, breakdown, of, democracy, telling, them, if, i, were, a, young, man, i, would, emigrate, in, mid, 1978, the, economy, began, to, recover, and, opinion, polls, showed, labour, in, the, lead, with, a, general, election, being, expected, later, that, year, and, a, labour, win, a, serious, possibility, now, prime, minister, callaghan, surprised, many, by, announcing, on, 7, september, that, there, would, be, no, general, election, that, year, and, that, he, would, wait, until, 1979, before, going, to, the, polls, thatcher, reacted, to, this, by, branding, the, labour, government, chickens, and, liberal, party, leader, david, steel, joined, in, criticising, labour, for, running, scared, the, labour, government, then, faced, fresh, public, unease, about, the, direction, of, the, country, and, a, damaging, series, of, strikes, during, the, winter, of, 1978, 79, dubbed, the, winter, of, discontent, the, conservatives, attacked, the, labour, government, s, unemployment, record, using,

my, face, softly, made, up, and, my, fair, hair, gently, waved, the, iron, lady, of, the, western, world, in, 1976, thatcher, gave, her, britain, awake, foreign, policy, speech, which, lambasted, the, soviet, union, saying, it, was, bent, on, world, dominance, the, soviet, army, journal, red, star, reported, her, stance, in, a, piece, headlined, iron, lady, raises, fears, alluding, to, her, remarks, on, the, iron, curtain, the, sunday, times, covered, the, red, star, article, the, next, day, and, thatcher, embraced, the, epithet, a, week, later, in, a, speech, to, finchley, conservatives, she, likened, it, to, the, duke, of, wellington, s, nickname, iron, duke, the, iron, metaphor, followed, her, throughout, ever, since, and, would, become, a, generic, sobriquet, for, other, strong, willed, female, politicians, thatcher, became, prime, minister, on, 4, may, 1979, arriving, at, downing, street, she, said, paraphrasing, the, prayer, of, saint, francis, where, there, is, discord, may, we, bring, harmony, where, there, is, error, may, we, bring, truth, where, there, is, doubt, may, we, bring, faith, and, where, there, is, despair, may, we, bring, hope, in, office, throughout, the, 1980s, thatcher, was, frequently, referred, to, as, the, most, powerful, woman, in, the, world, thatcher, was, the, opposition, leader, and, prime, minister, at, a, time, of, increased, racial, tension, in, britain, during, the, 1977, local, elections, the, economist, commented, the, tory, tide, swamped, the, smaller, parties, specifically, the, national, front, which, suffered, a, clear, decline, from, last, year, her, standing, in, the, polls, had, risen, by, 11, after, a, 1978, interview, for, world, in, action, in, which, she, said, the, british, character, has, done, so, much, for, democracy, for, law, and, done, so, much, throughout, the, world, that, if, there, is, any, fear, that, it, might, be, swamped, people, are, going, to, react, and, be, rather, hostile, to, those, coming, in, as, well, as, in, many, ways, add, to, the, richness, and, variety, of, this, country, the, moment, the, minority, threatens, to, become, a, big, one, people, get, frightened, in, the, 1979, general, election, the, conservatives, had, attracted, votes, from, the, nf, whose, support, almost, collapsed, in, a, july, 1979, meeting, with, foreign, secretary, lord, carrington, and, home, secretary, william, whitelaw, thatcher, objected, to, the, number, of, asian, immigrants, in, the, context, of, limiting, the, total, of, vietnamese, boat, people, allowed, to, settle, in, the, uk, to, fewer, than, 10, 000, over, two, years, as, prime, minister, thatcher, met, weekly, with, queen, elizabeth, ii, to, discuss, government, business, and, their, relationship, came, under, scrutiny, campbell, 2011a, p, 464, states, one, question, that, continued, to, fascinate, the, public, about, the, phenomenon, of, a, woman, prime, minister, was, how, she, got, on, with, the, queen, the, answer, is, that, their, relations, were, punctiliously, correct, but, there, was, little, love, lost, on, either, side, as, two, women, of, very, similar, age, mrs, thatcher, was, six, months, older, occupying, parallel, positions, at, the, top, of, the, social, pyramid, one, the, head, of, government, the, other, head, of, state, they, were, bound, to, be, in, some, sense, rivals, mrs, thatcher, s, attitude, to, the, queen, was, ambivalent, on, the, one, hand, she, had, an, almost, mystical, reverence, for, the, institution, of, the, monarchy, yet, at, the, same, time, she, was, trying, to, modernise, the, country, and, sweep, away, many, of, the, values, and, practices, which, the, monarchy, perpetuated, michael, shea, the, queen, s, press, secretary, in, 1986, leaked, stories, of, a, deep, rift, to, the, sunday, times, he, said, that, she, felt, thatcher, s, policies, were, uncaring, confrontational, and, socially, divisive, thatcher, later, wrote, i, always, found, the, queen, s, attitude, towards, the, work, of, the, government, absolutely, correct, stories, of, clashes, between, two, powerful, women, were, just, too, good, not, to, make, up, thatcher, s, economic, policy, was, influenced, by, monetarist, thinking, and, economists, such, as, milton, friedman, and, alan, walters, together, with, her, first, chancellor, geoffrey, howe, she, lowered, direct, taxes, on, income, and, increased, indirect, taxes, she, increased, interest, rates, to, slow, the, growth, of, the, money, supply, and, thereby, lower, inflation, introduced, cash, limits, on, public, spending, and, reduced, expenditure, on, social, services, such, as, education, and, housing, cuts, to, higher, education, led, to, thatcher, being, the, first, oxonian, post, war, prime, minister, without, an, honorary, doctorate, from, oxford, university, after, a, 738, 319, vote, of, the, governing, assembly, and, a, student, petition, some, heathite, conservatives, in, the, cabinet, the, so, called, wets, expressed, doubt, over, thatcher, s, policies, the, 1981, england, riots, resulted, in, the, british, media, discussing, the, need, for, a, policy, u, turn, at, the, 1980, conservative, party, conference, thatcher, addressed, the, issue, directly, with, a, speech, written, by, the, playwright, ronald, millar, that, notably, included, the, following, lines, to, those, waiting, with, bated, breath, for, that, favourite, media, catchphrase, the, u, turn, i, have, only, one, thing, to, say, you, turn, if, you, want, to, the, lady, s, not, for, turning, thatcher, s, job, approval, rating, fell, to, 23, by, december, 1980, lower, than, recorded, for, any, previous, prime, minister, as, the, recession, of, the, early, 1980s, deepened, she, increased, taxes, despite, concerns, expressed, in, a, march, 1981, statement, signed, by, 364, leading, economists, which, argued, there, was, no, basis, in, economic, theory, for, the, government, s, belief, that, by, deflating, demand, they, will, bring, inflation, permanently, under, control, adding, that, present, policies, will, deepen, the, depression, erode, the, industrial, base, of, our, economy, and, threaten, its, social, and, political, stability, by, 1982, the, uk, began, to, experience, signs, of, economic, recovery, inflation, was, down, to, 8, 6, from, a, high, of, 18, but, unemployment, was, over, 3, million, for, the, first, time, since, the, 1930s, by, 1983, overall, economic, growth, was, stronger, and, inflation, and, mortgage, rates, had, fallen, to, their, lowest, levels, in, 13, years, although, manufacturing, employment, as, a, share, of, total, employment, fell, to, just, over, 30, with, total, unemployment, remaining, high, peaking, at, 3, 3, million, in, 1984, during, the, 1982, conservative, party, conference, thatcher, said, we, have, done, more, to, roll, back, the, frontiers, of, socialism, than, any, previous, conservative, government, she, said, at, the, party, conference, the, following, year, that, the, british, people, had, completely, rejected, state, socialism, and, understood, the, state, has, no, source, of, money, other, than, money, which, people, earn, themselves, there, is, no, such, thing, as, public, money, there, is, only, taxpayers, money, by, 1987, unemployment, was, falling, the, economy, was, stable, and, strong, and, inflation, was, low, opinion, polls, showed, a, comfortable, conservative, lead, and, local, council, election, results, had, also, been, successful, prompting, thatcher, to, call, a, general, election, for, 11, june, that, year, despite, the, deadline, for, an, election, still, being, 12, months, away, the, election, saw, thatcher, re, elected, for, a, third, successive, term, thatcher, had, been, firmly, opposed, to, british, membership, of, the, exchange, rate, mechanism, erm, a, precursor, to, european, economic, and, monetary, union, believing, that, it, would, constrain, the, british, economy, despite, the, urging, of, both, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, nigel, lawson, and, foreign, secretary, geoffrey, howe, in, october, 1990, she, was, persuaded, by, john, major, lawson, s, successor, as, chancellor, to, join, the, erm, at, what, proved, to, be, too, high, a, rate, thatcher, reformed, local, government, taxes, by, replacing, domestic, rates, a, tax, based, on, the, nominal, rental, value, of, a, home, with, the, community, charge, or, poll, tax, in, which, the, same, amount, was, charged, to, each, adult, resident, the, new, tax, was, introduced, in, scotland, in, 1989, and, in, england, and, wales, the, following, year, and, proved, to, be, among, the, most, unpopular, policies, of, her, premiership, public, disquiet, culminated, in, a, 70, 000, to, 200, 000, strong, demonstration, in, london, in, march, 1990, the, demonstration, around, trafalgar, square, deteriorated, into, riots, leaving, 113, people, injured, and, 340, under, arrest, the, community, charge, was, abolished, in, 1991, by, her, successor, john, major, it, has, since, transpired, that, thatcher, herself, had, failed, to, register, for, the, tax, and, was, threatened, with, financial, penalties, if, she, did, not, return, her, form, thatcher, believed, that, the, trade, unions, were, harmful, to, both, ordinary, trade, unionists, and, the, public, she, was, committed, to, reducing, the, power, of, the, unions, whose, leadership, she, accused, of, undermining, parliamentary, democracy, and, economic, performance, through, strike, action, several, unions, launched, strikes, in, response, to, legislation, introduced, to, limit, their, power, but, resistance, eventually, collapsed, only, 39, of, union, members, voted, labour, in, the, 1983, general, election, according, to, the, bbc, s, political, correspondent, in, 2004, thatcher, managed, to, destroy, the, power, of, the, trade, unions, for, almost, a, generation, the, miners, strike, of, 1984, 85, was, the, biggest, and, most, devastating, confrontation, between, the, unions, and, the, thatcher, government, in, march, 1984, the, national, coal, board, ncb, proposed, to, close, 20, of, the, 174, state, owned, mines, and, cut, 20, 000, jobs, out, of, 187, 000, two, thirds, of, the, country, s, miners, led, by, the, national, union, of, mineworkers, num, under, arthur, scargill, went, on, strike, in, protest, however, scargill, refused, to, hold, a, ballot, on, the, strike, having, previously, lost, three, ballots, on, a, national, strike, in, january, and, october, 1982, and, march, 1983, this, led, to, the, strike, being, declared, illegal, by, the, high, court, of, justice, thatcher, refused, to, meet, the, union, s, demands, and, compared, the, miners, dispute, to, the, falklands, war, declaring, in, a, speech, in, 1984, we, had, to, fight, the, enemy, without, in, the, falklands, we, always, have, to, be, aware, of, the, enemy, within, which, is, much, more, difficult, to, fight, and, more, dangerous, to, liberty, thatcher, s, opponents, characterised, her, words, as, indicating, contempt, for, the, working, class, and, have, been, employed, in, criticism, of, her, ever, since, after, a, year, out, on, strike, in, march, 1985, the, num, leadership, conceded, without, a, deal, the, cost, to, the, economy, was, estimated, to, be, at, least, 1, 5, billion, and, the, strike, was, blamed, for, much, of, the, pound, s, fall, against, the, us, dollar, thatcher, reflected, on, the, end, of, the, strike, in, her, statement, that, if, anyone, has, won, it, was, the, miners, who, stayed, at, work, and, all, those, that, have, kept, britain, going, the, government, closed, 25, unprofitable, coal, mines, in, 1985, and, by, 1992, a, total, of, 97, mines, had, been, closed, those, that, remained, were, privatised, in, 1994, the, resulting, closure, of, 150, coal, mines, some, of, which, were, not, losing, money, resulted, in, the, loss, of, tens, of, thousands, of, jobs, and, had, the, effect, of, devastating, entire, communities, strikes, had, helped, bring, down, heath, s, government, and, thatcher, was, determined, to, succeed, where, he, had, failed, her, strategy, of, preparing, fuel, stocks, appointing, hardliner, ian, macgregor, as, ncb, leader, and, ensuring, that, police, were, adequately, trained, and, equipped, with, riot, gear, contributed, to, her, triumph, over, the, striking, miners, the, number, of, stoppages, across, the, uk, peaked, at, 4, 583, in, 1979, when, more, than, 29, million, working, days, had, been, lost, in, 1984, the, year, of, the, miners, strike, there, were, 1, 221, resulting, in, the, loss, of, more, than, 27, million, working, days, stoppages, then, fell, steadily, throughout, the, rest, of, thatcher, s, premiership, in, 1990, there, were, 630, and, fewer, than, 2, million, working, days, lost, and, they, continued, to, fall, thereafter, thatcher, s, tenure, also, witnessed, a, sharp, decline, in, trade, union, density, with, the, percentage, of, workers, belonging, to, a, trade, union, falling, from, 57, 3, in, 1979, to, 49, 5, in, 1985, in, 1979, up, until, thatcher, s, final, year, in, office, trade, union, membership, also, fell, from, 13, 5, million, in, 1979, to, fewer, than, 10, million, the, policy, of, privatisation, has, been, called, a, crucial, ingredient, of, thatcherism, after, the, 1983, election, the, sale, of, state, utilities, accelerated, more, than, 29, billion, was, raised, from, the, sale, of, nationalised, industries, and, another, 18, billion, from, the, sale, of, council, houses, the, process, of, privatisation, especially, the, preparation, of, nationalised, industries, for, privatisation, was, associated, with, marked, improvements, in, performance, particularly, in, terms, of, labour, productivity, some, of, the, privatised, industries, including, gas, water, and, electricity, were, natural, monopolies, for, which, privatisation, involved, little, increase, in, competition, the, privatised, industries, that, demonstrated, improvement, sometimes, did, so, while, still, under, state, ownership, british, steel, corporation, had, made, great, gains, in, profitability, while, still, a, nationalised, industry, under, the, government, appointed, macgregor, chairmanship, which, faced, down, trade, union, opposition, to, close, plants, and, halve, the, workforce, regulation, was, also, significantly, expanded, to, compensate, for, the, loss, of, direct, government, control, with, the, foundation, of, regulatory, bodies, such, as, oftel, 1984, ofgas, 1986, and, the, national, rivers, authority, 1989, there, was, no, clear, pattern, to, the, degree, of, competition, regulation, and, performance, among, the, privatised, industries, in, most, cases, privatisation, benefited, consumers, in, terms, of, lower, prices, and, improved, efficiency, but, results, overall, have, been, mixed, not, all, privatised, companies, have, had, successful, share, price, trajectories, in, the, longer, term, a, 2010, review, by, the, iea, states, t, does, seem, to, be, the, case, that, once, competition, and, or, effective, regulation, was, introduced, performance, improved, markedly, but, i, hasten, to, emphasise, again, that, the, literature, is, not, unanimous, thatcher, always, resisted, privatising, british, rail, and, was, said, to, have, told, transport, secretary, nicholas, ridley, railway, privatisation, will, be, the, waterloo, of, this, government, please, never, mention, the, railways, to, me, again, shortly, before, her, resignation, in, 1990, she, accepted, the, arguments, for, privatisation, which, her, successor, john, major, implemented, in, 1994, the, privatisation, of, public, assets, was, combined, with, financial, deregulation, to, fuel, economic, growth, chancellor, geoffrey, howe, abolished, the, uk, s, exchange, controls, in, 1979, which, allowed, more, capital, to, be, invested,

it, at, the, time, it, was, revealed, in, 1991, that, while, not, directly, training, any, khmer, rouge, from, 1983, the, special, air, service, sas, was, sent, to, secretly, train, the, armed, forces, of, the, cambodian, non, communist, resistance, that, remained, loyal, to, prince, norodom, sihanouk, and, his, former, prime, minister, son, sann, in, the, fight, against, the, vietnamese,

and, reforms, enacted, by, gorbachev, in, the, ussr, she, declared, in, november, 1988, that, e, re, not, in, a, cold, war, now, but, rather, in, a, new, relationship, much, wider, than, the, cold,

thatcher, bonded, quickly, with, us, president, ronald, reagan, she, gave, strong, support, to, the, reagan, administration, s, cold, war, policies, based, on, their, shared, distrust, of, communism, a, sharp, disagreement, came, in, 1983, when, reagan, did, not, consult, with, her, on, the, invasion, of, grenada, during, her, first, year, as, prime, minister, she, supported, nato, s, decision, to, deploy, us, nuclear, cruise, and, pershing, ii, missiles, in, western, europe, permitting, the, us, to, station, more, than, 160, cruise, missiles, at, raf, greenham, common, starting, in,

tripling, the, uk, s, nuclear, forces, at, an, eventual, cost, of, more, than, 12, billion, at, 1996, 97, prices, thatcher, s, preference, for, defence, ties, with, the, us, was, demonstrated, in, the, westland, affair, of, 1985, 86, when, she, acted, with, colleagues, to, allow, the, struggling, helicopter, manufacturer, westland, to, refuse, a, takeover, offer, from, the, italian, firm, agusta, in, favour, of, the, management, s, preferred, option, a, link, with, sikorsky, aircraft, defence, secretary, michael, heseltine, who, had, supported, the, agusta, deal, resigned, from, the,

succeeded, reagan, in, 1989, she, recommended, intervention, and, put, pressure, on, bush, to, deploy, troops, in, the, middle, east, to, drive, the, iraqi, army, out, of, kuwait, bush, was, apprehensive, about, the, plan, prompting, thatcher, to, remark, to, him, during, a, telephone, conversation, this, was, no, time, to, go, wobbly, thatcher, s, government, supplied, military, forces, to, the, international, coalition, in, the, build, up, to, the, gulf, war, but, she, had, resigned, by, the, time, hostilities, began, on, 17, january, 1991, she, applauded, the, coalition, victory, on, the, backbenches, while, warning, that, the, victories, of, peace, will, take, longer, than, the, battles, of, war, it, was, disclosed, in, 2017, that, thatcher, had, suggested, threatening, saddam, with, chemical, weapons, after, the, invasion, of, kuwait, on, 2, april, 1982, the, ruling, military, junta, in, argentina, ordered, the, invasion, of, the, british, overseas, territories, of, the, falkland, islands, and, south, georgia, triggering, the, falklands, war, the, subsequent, crisis, was, a, defining, moment, of, premiership, at, the, suggestion, of, harold, macmillan, and, robert, armstrong, she, set, up, and, chaired, a, small, war, cabinet, formally, called, odsa, overseas, and, defence, committee, south, atlantic, to, oversee, the, conduct, of, the, war, which, by, 5, 6, april, had, authorised, and, dispatched, a, naval, task, force, to, retake, the, islands, argentina, surrendered, on, 14, june, and, operation, corporate, was, hailed, a, success, notwithstanding, the, deaths, of, 255, british, servicemen, and, three, falkland, islanders, argentine, fatalities, totalled, 649, half, of, them, after, the, nuclear, powered, submarine, hms, conqueror, torpedoed, and, sank, the, cruiser, ara, general, belgrano, on, 2, may, thatcher, was, criticised, for, the, neglect, of, the, falklands, defence, that, led, to, the, war, and, especially, by, labour, mp, tam, dalyell, in, parliament, for, the, decision, to, torpedo, the, general, belgrano, but, overall, she, was, considered, a, competent, and, committed, war, leader, the, falklands, factor, an, economic, recovery, beginning, early, in, 1982, and, a, bitterly, divided, opposition, all, contributed, to, thatcher, s, second, election, victory, in, 1983, thatcher, frequently, referred, after, the, war, to, the, falklands, spirit, hastings, jenkins, 1983, p, 329, suggests, that, this, reflected, her, preference, for, the, streamlined, decision, making, of, her, war, cabinet, over, the, painstaking, deal, making, of, peacetime, cabinet, government, in, september, 1982, she, visited, china, to, discuss, with, deng, xiaoping, the, sovereignty, of, hong, kong, after, 1997, china, was, the, first, communist, state, thatcher, had, visited, as, prime, minister, and, she, was, the, first, british, prime, minister, to, visit, china, throughout, their, meeting, she, sought, the, prc, s, agreement, to, a, continued, british, presence, in, the, territory, deng, insisted, that, the, prc, s, sovereignty, over, hong, kong, was, non, negotiable, but, stated, his, willingness, to, settle, the, sovereignty, issue, with, the, british, government, through, formal, negotiations, both, governments, promised, to, maintain, hong, kong, s, stability, and, prosperity, after, the, two, year, negotiations, thatcher, conceded, to, the, prc, government, and, signed, the, sino, british, joint, declaration, in, beijing, in, 1984, agreeing, to, hand, over, hong, kong, s, sovereignty, in, 1997, despite, saying, that, she, was, in, favour, of, peaceful, negotiations, to, end, apartheid, thatcher, opposed, sanctions, imposed, on, south, africa, by, the, commonwealth, and, the, european, economic, community, eec, she, attempted, to, preserve, trade, with, south, africa, while, persuading, its, government, to, abandon, apartheid, this, included, asting, herself, as, president, botha, s, candid, friend, and, inviting, him, to, visit, the, uk, in, 1984, despite, the, inevitable, demonstrations, against, his, government, alan, merrydew, of, the, canadian, broadcaster, bctv, news, asked, thatcher, what, her, response, was, to, a, reported, anc, statement, that, they, will, target, british, firms, in, south, africa, to, which, she, later, replied, when, the, anc, says, that, they, will, target, british, companies, this, shows, what, a, typical, terrorist, organisation, it, is, i, fought, terrorism, all, my, life, and, if, more, people, fought, it, and, we, were, all, more, successful, we, should, not, have, it, and, i, hope, that, everyone, in, this, hall, will, think, it, is, right, to, go, on, fighting, terrorism, during, his, visit, to, britain, five, months, after, his, release, from, prison, nelson, mandela, praised, thatcher, she, is, an, enemy, of, apartheid, we, have, much, to, thank, her, for, thatcher, and, her, party, supported, british, membership, of, the, eec, in, the, 1975, national, referendum, and, the, single, european, act, of, 1986, and, obtained, the, uk, rebate, on, contributions, but, she, believed, that, the, role, of, the, organisation, should, be, limited, to, ensuring, free, trade, and, effective, competition, and, feared, that, the, eec, approach, was, at, odds, with, her, views, on, smaller, government, and, deregulation, believing, that, the, single, market, would, result, in, political, integration, thatcher, s, opposition, to, further, european, integration, became, more, pronounced, during, her, premiership, and, particularly, after, her, third, government, in, 1987, in, her, bruges, speech, in, 1988, thatcher, outlined, her, opposition, to, proposals, from, the, eec, forerunner, of, the, european, union, for, a, federal, structure, and, increased, centralisation, of, decision, making, we, have, not, successfully, rolled, back, the, frontiers, of, the, state, in, britain, only, to, see, them, re, imposed, at, a, european, level, with, a, european, super, state, exercising, a, new, dominance, from, brussels, sharing, the, concerns, of, french, president, fran, ois, mitterrand, thatcher, was, initially, opposed, to, german, reunification, telling, gorbachev, that, it, would, lead, to, a, change, to, postwar, borders, and, we, cannot, allow, that, because, such, a, development, would, undermine, the, stability, of, the, whole, international, situation, and, could, endanger, our, security, she, expressed, concern, that, a, united, germany, would, align, itself, more, closely, with, the, soviet, union, and, move, away, from, nato, in, march, 1990, thatcher, held, a, chequers, seminar, on, the, subject, of, german, reunification, that, was, attended, by, members, of, her, cabinet, and, historians, such, as, norman, stone, george, urban, timothy, garton, ash, and, gordon, a, craig, during, the, seminar, thatcher, described, what, urban, called, saloon, bar, clich, s, about, the, german, character, including, angst, aggressiveness, assertiveness, bullying, egotism, inferiority, complex, sentimentality, those, present, were, shocked, to, hear, thatcher, s, utterances, and, appalled, at, how, she, was, apparently, unaware, about, the, post, war, german, collective, guilt, and, germans, attempts, to, work, through, their, past, the, words, of, the, meeting, were, leaked, by, her, foreign, policy, advisor, charles, powell, and, subsequently, her, comments, were, met, with, fierce, backlash, and, controversy, during, the, same, month, german, chancellor, helmut, kohl, reassured, thatcher, that, he, would, keep, her, informed, of, all, his, intentions, about, unification, and, that, he, was, prepared, to, disclose, matters, which, even, his, cabinet, would, not, know, during, her, premiership, thatcher, had, the, second, lowest, average, approval, rating, 40, of, any, post, war, prime, minister, since, nigel, lawson, s, resignation, as, chancellor, in, october, 1989, polls, consistently, showed, that, she, was, less, popular, than, her, party, a, self, described, conviction, politician, thatcher, always, insisted, that, she, did, not, care, about, her, poll, ratings, and, pointed, instead, to, her, unbeaten, election, record, in, december, 1989, thatcher, was, challenged, for, the, leadership, of, the, conservative, party, by, the, little, known, backbench, mp, sir, anthony, meyer, of, the, 374, conservative, mps, eligible, to, vote, 314, voted, for, thatcher, and, 33, for, meyer, her, supporters, in, the, party, viewed, the, result, as, a, success, and, rejected, suggestions, that, there, was, discontent, within, the, party, opinion, polls, in, september, 1990, reported, that, labour, had, established, a, 14, lead, over, the, conservatives, and, by, november, the, conservatives, had, been, trailing, labour, for, 18, months, these, ratings, together, with, thatcher, s, combative, personality, and, tendency, to, override, collegiate, opinion, contributed, to, further, discontent, within, her, party, in, july, 1989, thatcher, removed, geoffrey, howe, as, foreign, secretary, after, he, and, lawson, had, forced, her, to, agree, to, a, plan, for, britain, to, join, the, european, exchange, rate, mechanism, erm, britain, joined, the, erm, in, october, 1990, on, 1, november, 1990, howe, by, then, the, last, remaining, member, of, thatcher, s, original, 1979, cabinet, resigned, as, deputy, prime, minister, ostensibly, over, her, open, hostility, to, moves, towards, european, monetary, union, in, his, resignation, speech, on, 13, november, which, was, instrumental, in, thatcher, s, downfall, howe, attacked, thatcher, s, openly, dismissive, attitude, to, the, government, s, proposal, for, a, new, european, currency, competing, against, existing, currencies, a, hard, ecu, how, on, earth, are, the, chancellor, and, the, governor, of, the, bank, of, england, commending, the, hard, ecu, as, they, strive, to, to, be, taken, as, serious, participants, in, the, debate, against, that, kind, of, background, noise, i, believe, that, both, the, chancellor, and, the, governor, are, cricketing, enthusiasts, so, i, hope, that, there, is, no, monopoly, of, cricketing, metaphors, it, is, rather, like, sending, your, opening, batsmen, to, the, crease, only, for, them, to, find, the, moment, the, first, balls, are, bowled, that, their, bats, have, been, broken, before, the, game, by, the, team, captain, on, 14, november, michael, heseltine, mounted, a, challenge, for, the, leadership, of, the, conservative, party, opinion, polls, had, indicated, that, he, would, give, the, conservatives, a, national, lead, over, labour, although, thatcher, led, on, the, first, ballot, with, the, votes, of, 204, conservative, mps, 54, 8, to, 152, votes, 40, 9, for, heseltine, with, 16, abstentions, she, was, four, votes, short, of, the, required, 15, majority, a, second, ballot, was, therefore, necessary, thatcher, initially, declared, her, intention, to, fight, on, and, fight, to, win, the, second, ballot, but, consultation, with, her, cabinet, persuaded, her, to, withdraw, after, holding, an, audience, with, the, queen, calling, other, world, leaders, and, making, one, final, commons, speech, on, 28, november, she, left, downing, street, in, tears, she, reportedly, regarded, her, ousting, as, a, betrayal, her, resignation, was, a, shock, to, many, outside, britain, with, such, foreign, observers, as, henry, kissinger, and, gorbachev, expressing, private, consternation, chancellor, john, major, replaced, thatcher, as, head, of, government, and, party, leader, whose, lead, over, heseltine, in, the, second, ballot, was, sufficient, for, heseltine, to, drop, out, major, oversaw, an, upturn, in, conservative, support, in, the, 17, months, leading, to, the, 1992, general, election, and, led, the, party, to, a, fourth, successive, victory, on, 9, april, 1992, thatcher, had, lobbied, for, major, in, the, leadership, contest, against, heseltine, but, her, support, for, him, waned, in, later, years, after, leaving, the, premiership, thatcher, returned, to, the, backbenches, as, a, constituency, parliamentarian, her, domestic, approval, rating, recovered, after, her, resignation, though, public, opinion, remained, divided, on, whether, her, government, had, been, good, for, the, country, aged, 66, she, retired, from, the, house, of, commons, at, the, 1992, general, election, saying, that, leaving, the, commons,
