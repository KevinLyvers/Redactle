sir, francis, galton, frs, frai, l, t, n, 16, february, 1822, 17, january, 1911, was, a, british, polymath, and, the, originator, of, eugenics, during, the, victorian, era, his, ideas, later, became, the, basis, of, behavioral, genetics, galton, produced, over, 340, papers, and, books, he, also, developed, the, statistical, concept, of, correlation, and, widely, promoted, regression, toward, the, mean, he, was, the, first, to, apply, statistical, methods, to, the, study, of, human, differences, and, inheritance, of, intelligence, and, introduced, the, use, of, questionnaires, and, surveys, for, collecting, data, on, human, communities, which, he, needed, for, genealogical, and, biographical, works, and, for, his, anthropometric, studies, he, coined, the, phrase, nature, versus, nurture, his, book, hereditary, genius, 1869, was, the, first, social, scientific, attempt, to, study, genius, and, greatness, as, an, investigator, of, the, human, mind, he, founded, psychometrics, and, differential, psychology, as, well, as, the, lexical, hypothesis, of, personality, he, devised, a, method, for, classifying, fingerprints, that, proved, useful, in, forensic, science, he, also, conducted, research, on, the, power, of, prayer, concluding, it, had, none, due, to, its, null, effects, on, the, longevity, of, those, prayed, for, his, quest, for, the, scientific, principles, of, diverse, phenomena, extended, even, to, the, optimal, method, for, making, tea, as, the, initiator, of, scientific, meteorology, he, devised, the, first, weather, map, proposed, a, theory, of, anticyclones, and, was, the, first, to, establish, a, complete, record, of, short, term, climatic, phenomena, on, a, european, scale, he, also, invented, the, galton, whistle, for, testing, differential, hearing, ability, galton, was, charles, darwin, s, half, cousin, galton, was, knighted, in, 1909, for, his, contributions, to, science, in, recent, years, he, has, received, significant, criticism, for, being, a, proponent, of, social, darwinism, eugenics, and, biological, racism, he, was, a, pioneer, of, eugenics, coining, the, term, itself, in, 1883, galton, was, born, at, the, larches, a, large, house, in, the, sparkbrook, area, of, birmingham, england, built, on, the, site, of, fair, hill, the, former, home, of, joseph, priestley, which, the, botanist, william, withering, had, renamed, he, was, charles, darwin, s, half, cousin, sharing, the, common, grandparent, erasmus, darwin, his, father, was, samuel, tertius, galton, son, of, samuel, galton, jr, he, was, also, a, cousin, of, douglas, strutt, galton, the, galtons, were, quaker, gun, manufacturers, and, bankers, while, the, darwins, were, involved, in, medicine, and, science, both, the, galton, and, darwin, families, included, fellows, of, the, royal, society, and, members, who, loved, to, invent, in, their, spare, time, both, erasmus, darwin, and, samuel, galton, were, founding, members, of, the, lunar, society, of, birmingham, which, included, matthew, boulton, james, watt, josiah, wedgwood, joseph, priestley, and, richard, lovell, edgeworth, both, families, were, known, for, their, literary, talent, erasmus, darwin, composed, lengthy, technical, treatises, in, verse, galton, s, aunt, mary, anne, galton, wrote, on, aesthetics, and, religion, and, her, autobiography, detailed, the, environment, of, her, childhood, populated, by, lunar, society, members, galton, was, a, child, prodigy, he, was, reading, by, the, age, of, two, at, age, five, he, knew, some, greek, latin, and, long, division, and, by, the, age, of, six, he, had, moved, on, to, adult, books, including, shakespeare, for, pleasure, and, poetry, which, he, quoted, at, length, galton, attended, king, edward, s, school, birmingham, but, chafed, at, the, narrow, classical, curriculum, and, left, at, 16, his, parents, pressed, him, to, enter, the, medical, profession, and, he, studied, for, two, years, at, birmingham, general, hospital, and, king, s, college, london, medical, school, he, followed, this, up, with, mathematical, studies, at, trinity, college, cambridge, from, 1840, to, early, 1844, according, to, the, records, of, the, united, grand, lodge, of, england, it, was, in, february, 1844, that, galton, became, a, freemason, at, the, scientific, lodge, held, at, the, red, lion, inn, in, cambridge, progressing, through, the, three, masonic, degrees, apprentice, 5, february, 1844, fellow, craft, 11, march, 1844, master, mason, 13, may, 1844, a, note, in, the, record, states, francis, galton, trinity, college, student, gained, his, certificate, 13, march, 1845, one, of, galton, s, masonic, certificates, from, scientific, lodge, can, be, found, among, his, papers, at, university, college, london, a, nervous, breakdown, prevented, galton, s, intent, to, try, for, honours, he, elected, instead, to, take, a, poll, pass, b, a, degree, like, his, half, cousin, charles, darwin, following, the, cambridge, custom, he, was, awarded, an, m, a, without, further, study, in, 1847, he, briefly, resumed, his, medical, studies, but, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1844, left, him, emotionally, destitute, though, financially, independent, and, he, terminated, his, medical, studies, entirely, turning, to, foreign, travel, sport, and, technical, invention, in, his, early, years, galton, was, an, enthusiastic, traveller, and, made, a, solo, trip, through, eastern, europe, to, istanbul, before, going, up, to, cambridge, in, 1845, and, 1846, he, went, to, egypt, and, travelled, up, the, nile, to, khartoum, in, the, sudan, and, from, there, to, beirut, damascus, and, down, to, jordan, in, 1850, he, joined, the, royal, geographical, society, and, over, the, next, two, years, mounted, a, long, and, difficult, expedition, into, then, little, known, south, west, africa, now, namibia, he, wrote, a, book, on, his, experience, narrative, of, an, explorer, in, tropical, south, africa, he, was, awarded, the, royal, geographical, society, s, founder, s, medal, in, 1853, and, the, silver, medal, of, the, french, geographical, society, for, his, pioneering, cartographic, survey, of, the, region, this, established, his, reputation, as, a, geographer, and, explorer, he, proceeded, to, write, the, best, selling, the, art, of, travel, a, handbook, of, practical, advice, for, the, victorian, on, the, move, which, went, through, many, editions, and, is, still, in, print, galton, was, a, polymath, who, made, important, contributions, in, many, fields, including, meteorology, the, anticyclone, and, the, first, popular, weather, maps, statistics, regression, and, correlation, psychology, synaesthesia, biology, the, nature, and, mechanism, of, heredity, and, criminology, fingerprints, much, of, this, was, influenced, by, his, penchant, for, counting, and, measuring, galton, prepared, the, first, weather, map, published, in, the, times, 1, april, 1875, showing, the, weather, from, the, previous, day, 31, march, now, a, standard, feature, in, newspapers, worldwide, he, became, very, active, in, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, presenting, many, papers, on, a, wide, variety, of, topics, at, its, meetings, from, 1858, to, 1899, he, was, the, general, secretary, from, 1863, to, 1867, president, of, the, geographical, section, in, 1867, and, 1872, and, president, of, the, anthropological, section, in, 1877, and, 1885, he, was, active, on, the, council, of, the, royal, geographical, society, for, over, forty, years, in, various, committees, of, the, royal, society, and, on, the, meteorological, council, james, mckeen, cattell, a, student, of, wilhelm, wundt, who, had, been, reading, galton, s, articles, decided, he, wanted, to, study, under, him, he, eventually, built, a, professional, relationship, with, galton, measuring, subjects, and, working, together, on, research, in, 1888, galton, established, a, lab, in, the, science, galleries, of, the, south, kensington, museum, in, galton, s, lab, participants, could, be, measured, to, gain, knowledge, of, their, strengths, and, weaknesses, galton, also, used, these, data, for, his, own, research, he, would, typically, charge, people, a, small, fee, for, his, services, the, publication, by, his, cousin, charles, darwin, of, the, origin, of, species, in, 1859, was, an, event, that, changed, galton, s, life, he, came, to, be, gripped, by, the, work, especially, the, first, chapter, on, variation, under, domestication, concerning, animal, breeding, galton, devoted, much, of, the, rest, of, his, life, to, exploring, variation, in, human, populations, and, its, implications, at, which, darwin, had, only, hinted, in, the, origin, of, species, although, he, returned, to, it, in, his, 1871, book, the, descent, of, man, drawing, on, his, cousin, s, work, in, the, intervening, period, galton, established, a, research, program, which, embraced, multiple, aspects, of, human, variation, from, mental, characteristics, to, height, from, facial, images, to, fingerprint, patterns, this, required, inventing, novel, measures, of, traits, devising, large, scale, collection, of, data, using, those, measures, and, in, the, end, the, discovery, of, new, statistical, techniques, for, describing, and, understanding, the, data, galton, was, interested, at, first, in, the, question, of, whether, human, ability, was, hereditary, and, proposed, to, count, the, number, of, the, relatives, of, various, degrees, of, eminent, men, if, the, qualities, were, hereditary, he, reasoned, there, should, be, more, eminent, men, among, the, relatives, than, among, the, general, population, to, test, this, he, invented, the, methods, of, historiometry, galton, obtained, extensive, data, from, a, broad, range, of, biographical, sources, which, he, tabulated, and, compared, in, various, ways, this, pioneering, work, was, described, in, detail, in, his, book, hereditary, genius, in, 1869, here, he, showed, among, other, things, that, the, numbers, of, eminent, relatives, dropped, off, when, going, from, the, first, degree, to, the, second, degree, relatives, and, from, the, second, degree, to, the, third, he, took, this, as, evidence, of, the, inheritance, of, abilities, galton, recognized, the, limitations, of, his, methods, in, these, two, works, and, believed, the, question, could, be, better, studied, by, comparisons, of, twins, his, method, envisaged, testing, to, see, if, twins, who, were, similar, at, birth, diverged, in, dissimilar, environments, and, whether, twins, dissimilar, at, birth, converged, when, reared, in, similar, environments, he, again, used, the, method, of, questionnaires, to, gather, various, sorts, of, data, which, were, tabulated, and, described, in, a, paper, the, history, of, twins, in, 1875, in, so, doing, he, anticipated, the, modern, field, of, behaviour, genetics, which, relies, heavily, on, twin, studies, he, concluded, that, the, evidence, favored, nature, rather, than, nurture, he, also, proposed, adoption, studies, including, trans, racial, adoption, studies, to, separate, the, effects, of, heredity, and, environment, galton, recognized, that, cultural, circumstances, influenced, the, capability, of, a, civilization, s, citizens, and, their, reproductive, success, in, hereditary, genius, he, envisaged, a, situation, conducive, to, resilient, and, enduring, civilization, as, follows, the, best, form, of, civilization, in, respect, to, the, improvement, of, the, race, would, be, one, in, which, society, was, not, costly, where, incomes, were, chiefly, derived, from, professional, sources, and, not, much, through, inheritance, where, every, lad, had, a, chance, of, showing, his, abilities, and, if, highly, gifted, was, enabled, to, achieve, a, first, class, education, and, entrance, into, professional, life, by, the, liberal, help, of, the, exhibitions, and, scholarships, which, he, had, gained, in, his, early, youth, where, marriage, was, held, in, as, high, honor, as, in, ancient, jewish, times, where, the, pride, of, race, was, encouraged, of, course, i, do, not, refer, to, the, nonsensical, sentiment, of, the, present, day, that, goes, under, that, name, where, the, weak, could, find, a, welcome, and, a, refuge, in, celibate, monasteries, or, sisterhoods, and, lastly, where, the, better, sort, of, emigrants, and, refugees, from, other, lands, were, invited, and, welcomed, and, their, descendants, naturalized, galton, invented, the, term, eugenics, in, 1883, and, set, down, many, of, his, observations, and, conclusions, in, a, book, inquiries, into, human, faculty, and, its, development, in, the, book, s, introduction, he, wrote, intention, is, to, touch, on, various, topics, more, or, less, connected, with, that, of, the, cultivation, of, race, or, as, we, might, call, it, with, eugenic, 1, questions, and, to, present, the, results, of, several, of, my, own, separate, investigations, 1, this, is, with, questions, bearing, on, what, is, termed, in, greek, eugenes, namely, good, in, stock, hereditarily, endowed, with, noble, qualities, this, and, the, allied, words, eugeneia, etc, are, equally, applicable, to, men, brutes, and, plants, we, greatly, want, a, brief, word, to, express, the, science, of, improving, stock, which, is, by, no, means, confined, to, questions, of, judicious, mating, but, which, especially, in, the, case, of, man, takes, cognizance, of, all, influences, that, tend, in, however, remote, a, degree, to, give, the, more, suitable, races, or, strains, of, blood, a, better, chance, of, prevailing, speedily, over, the, less, suitable, than, they, otherwise, would, have, had, the, word, eugenics, would, sufficiently, express, the, idea, it, is, at, least, a, neater, word, and, a, more, generalized, one, than, viriculture, which, i, once, ventured, to, use, he, believed, that, a, scheme, of, marks, for, family, merit, should, be, defined, and, early, marriage, between, families, of, high, rank, be, encouraged, via, provision, of, monetary, incentives, he, pointed, out, some, of, the, tendencies, in, british, society, such, as, the, late, marriages, of, eminent, people, and, the, paucity, of, their, children, which, he, thought, were, dysgenic, he, advocated, encouraging, eugenic, marriages, by, supplying, able, couples, with, incentives, to, have, children, on, 29, october, 1901, galton, chose, to, address, eugenic, issues, when, he, delivered, the, second, huxley, lecture, at, the, royal, anthropological, institute, the, eugenics, review, the, journal, of, the, eugenics, education, society, commenced, publication, in, 1909, galton, the, honorary, president, of, the, society, wrote, the, foreword, for, the, first, volume, the, first, international, congress, of, eugenics, was, held, in, july, 1912, winston, churchill, and, carls, elliot, were, among, the, attendees, galton, s, formulation, of, regression, and, its, link, to, the, bivariate, normal, distribution, can, be, traced, to, his, attempts, at, developing, a, mathematical, model, for, population, stability, although, galton, s, first, attempt, to, study, darwinian, questions, hereditary, genius, generated, little, enthusiasm, at, the, time, the, text, led, to, his, further, studies, in, the, 1870s, concerning, the, inheritance, of, physical, traits, this, text, contains, some, crude, notions, of, the, concept, of, regression, described, in, a, qualitative, matter, for, example, he, wrote, of, dogs, if, a, man, breeds, from, strong, well, shaped, dogs, but, of, mixed, pedigree, the, puppies, will, be, sometimes, but, rarely, the, equals, of, their, parents, they, will, commonly, be, of, a, mongrel, nondescript, type, because, ancestral, peculiarities, are, apt, to, crop, out, in, the, offspring, this, notion, created, a, problem, for, galton, as, he, could, not, reconcile, the, tendency, of, a, population, to, maintain, a, normal, distribution, of, traits, from, generation, to, generation, with, the, notion, of, inheritance, it, seemed, that, a, large, number, of, factors, operated, independently, on, offspring, leading, to, the, normal, distribution, of, a, trait, in, each, generation, however, this, provided, no, explanation, as, to, how, a, parent, can, have, a, significant, impact, on, his, offspring, which, was, the, basis, of, inheritance, galton, s, solution, to, this, problem, was, presented, in, his, presidential, address, at, the, september, 1885, meeting, of, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, as, he, was, serving, at, the, time, as, president, of, section, h, anthropology, the, address, was, published, in, nature, and, galton, further, developed, the, theory, in, regression, toward, mediocrity, in, hereditary, stature, and, hereditary, stature, an, elaboration, of, this, theory, was, published, in, 1889, in, natural, inheritance, there, were, three, key, developments, that, helped, galton, develop, this, theory, the, development, of, the, law, of, error, in, 1874, 1875, the, formulation, of, an, empirical, law, of, reversion, in, 1877, and, the, development, of, a, mathematical, framework, encompassing, regression, using, human, population, data, during, 1885, galton, s, development, of, the, law, of, regression, to, the, mean, or, reversion, was, due, to, insights, from, the, galton, board, bean, machine, and, his, studies, of, sweet, peas, while, galton, had, previously, invented, the, quincunx, prior, to, february, 1874, the, 1877, version, of, the, quincunx, had, a, new, feature, that, helped, galton, demonstrate, that, a, normal, mixture, of, normal, distributions, is, also, normal, galton, demonstrated, this, using, a, new, version, of, quincunx, adding, chutes, to, the, apparatus, to, represent, reversion, when, the, pellets, passed, through, the, curved, chutes, representing, reversion, and, then, the, pins, representing, family, variability, the, result, was, a, stable, population, on, friday, 19, february, 1877, galton, gave, a, lecture, entitled, typical, laws, of, heredity, at, the, royal, institution, in, london, in, this, lecture, he, posited, that, there, must, be, a, counteracting, force, to, maintain, population, stability, however, this, model, required, a, much, larger, degree, of, intergenerational, natural, selection, than, was, plausible, in, 1875, galton, started, growing, sweet, peas, and, addressed, the, royal, institution, on, his, findings, on, 9, february, 1877, he, found, that, each, group, of, progeny, seeds, followed, a, normal, curve, and, the, curves, were, equally, disperse, each, group, was, not, centred, on, the, parent, s, weight, but, rather, at, a, weight, closer, to, the, population, average, galton, called, this, reversion, as, every, progeny, group, was, distributed, at, a, value, that, was, closer, to, the, population, average, than, the, parent, the, deviation, from, the, population, average, was, in, the, same, direction, but, the, magnitude, of, the, deviation, was, only, one, third, as, large, in, doing, so, he, demonstrated, that, there, was, variability, among, each, of, the, families, yet, the, families, combined, to, produce, a, stable, normally, distributed, population, when, he, addressed, the, british, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, in, 1885, he, said, of, his, investigation, of, sweet, peas, i, was, then, blind, to, what, i, now, perceive, to, be, the, simple, explanation, of, the, phenomenon, galton, was, able, to, further, his, notion, of, regression, by, collecting, and, analyzing, data, on, human, stature, galton, asked, for, help, of, mathematician, j, hamilton, dickson, in, investigating, the, geometric, relationship, of, the, data, he, determined, that, the, regression, coefficient, did, not, ensure, population, stability, by, chance, but, rather, that, the, regression, coefficient, conditional, variance, and, population, were, interdependent, quantities, related, by, a, simple, equation, thus, galton, identified, that, the, linearity, of, regression, was, not, coincidental, but, rather, was, a, necessary, consequence, of, population, stability, the, model, for, population, stability, resulted, in, galton, s, formulation, of, the, law, of, ancestral, heredity, this, law, which, was, published, in, natural, inheritance, states, that, the, two, parents, of, an, offspring, jointly, contribute, one, half, of, an, offspring, s, heritage, while, the, other, more, removed, ancestors, constitute, a, smaller, proportion, of, the, offspring, s, heritage, galton, viewed, reversion, as, a, spring, that, when, stretched, would, return, the, distribution, of, traits, back, to, the, normal, distribution, he, concluded, that, evolution, would, have, to, occur, via, discontinuous, steps, as, reversion, would, neutralize, any, incremental, steps, when, mendel, s, principles, were, rediscovered, in, 1900, this, resulted, in, a, fierce, battle, between, the, followers, of, galton, s, law, of, ancestral, heredity, the, biometricians, and, those, who, advocated, mendel, s, principles, galton, conducted, wide, ranging, inquiries, into, heredity, which, led, him, to, challenge, charles, darwin, s, hypothesis, of, pangenesis, darwin, had, proposed, as, part, of, this, model, that, certain, particles, which, he, called, gemmules, moved, throughout, the, body, and, were, also, responsible, for, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, galton, in, consultation, with, darwin, set, out, to, see, if, they, were, transported, in, the, blood, in, a, long, series, of, experiments, in, 1869, to, 1871, he, transfused, the, blood, between, dissimilar, breeds, of, rabbits, and, examined, the, features, of, their, offspring, he, found, no, evidence, of, characters, transmitted, in, the, transfused, blood, darwin, challenged, the, validity, of, galton, s, experiment, giving, his, reasons, in, an, article, published, in, nature, where, he, wrote, now, in, the, chapter, on, pangenesis, in, my, variation, of, animals, and, plants, under, domestication, i, have, not, said, one, word, about, the, blood, or, about, any, fluid, proper, to, any, circulating, system, it, is, indeed, obvious, that, the, presence, of, gemmules, in, the, blood, can, form, no, necessary, part, of, my, hypothesis, for, i, refer, in, illustration, of, it, to, the, lowest, animals, such, as, the, protozoa, which, do, not, possess, blood, or, any, vessels, and, i, refer, to, plants, in, which, the, fluid, when, present, in, the, vessels, cannot, be, considered, as, true, blood, the, fundamental, laws, of, growth, reproduction, inheritance, c, are, so, closely, similar, throughout, the, whole, organic, kingdom, that, the, means, by, which, the, gemmules, assuming, for, the, moment, their, existence, are, diffused, through, the, body, would, probably, be, the, same, in, all, beings, therefore, the, means, can, hardly, be, diffusion, through, the, blood, nevertheless, when, i, first, heard, of, mr, galton, s, experiments, i, did, not, sufficiently, reflect, on, the, subject, and, saw, not, the, difficulty, of, believing, in, the, presence, of, gemmules, in, the, blood, galton, explicitly, rejected, the, idea, of, the, inheritance, of, acquired, characteristics, lamarckism, and, was, an, early, proponent, of, hard, heredity, through, selection, alone, he, came, close, to, rediscovering, mendel, s, particulate, theory, of, inheritance, but, was, prevented, from, making, the, final, breakthrough, in, this, regard, because, of, his, focus, on, continuous, rather, than, discrete, traits, now, regarded, as, polygenic, traits, he, went, on, to, found, the, biometric, approach, to, the, study, of, heredity, distinguished, by, its, use, of, statistical, techniques, to, study, continuous, traits, and, population, scale, aspects, of, heredity, this, approach, was, later, taken, up, enthusiastically, by, karl, pearson, and, w, f, r, weldon, together, they, founded, the, highly, influential, journal, biometrika, in, 1901, r, a, fisher, would, later, show, how, the, biometrical, approach, could, be, reconciled, with, the, mendelian, approach, the, statistical, techniques, that, galton, developed, correlation, and, regression, see, below, and, phenomena, he, established, regression, to, the, mean, formed, the, basis, of, the, biometric, approach, and, are, now, essential, tools, in, all, social, sciences, in, 1884, london, hosted, the, international, health, exhibition, this, exhibition, placed, much, emphasis, on, highlighting, victorian, developments, in, sanitation, and, public, health, and, allowed, the, nation, to, display, its, advanced, public, health, outreach, compared, to, other, countries, at, the, time, francis, galton, took, advantage, of, this, opportunity, to, set, up, his, anthropometric, laboratory, he, stated, that, the, purpose, of, this, laboratory, was, to, show, the, public, the, simplicity, of, the, instruments, and, methods, by, which, the, chief, physical, characteristics, of, man, may, be, measured, and, recorded, the, laboratory, was, an, interactive, walk, through, in, which, physical, characteristics, such, as, height, weight, and, eyesight, would, be, measured, for, each, subject, after, payment, of, an, admission, fee, upon, entering, the, laboratory, a, subject, would, visit, the, following, stations, in, order, first, they, would, fill, out, a, form, with, personal, and, family, history, age, birthplace, marital, status, residence, and, occupation, then, visit, stations, that, recorded, hair, and, eye, colour, followed, by, the, keenness, colour, sense, and, depth, perception, of, sight, next, they, would, examine, the, keenness, or, relative, acuteness, of, hearing, and, highest, audible, note, of, their, hearing, followed, by, an, examination, of, their, sense, of, touch, however, because, the, surrounding, area, was, noisy, the, apparatus, intended, to, measure, hearing, was, rendered, ineffective, by, the, noise, and, echoes, in, the, building, their, breathing, capacity, would, also, be, measured, as, well, as, their, ability, to, throw, a, punch, the, next, stations, would, examine, strength, of, both, pulling, and, squeezing, with, both, hands, lastly, subjects, heights, in, various, positions, sitting, standing, etc, as, well, as, arm, span, and, weight, would, be, measured, one, excluded, characteristic, of, interest, was, the, size, of, the, head, galton, notes, in, his, analysis, that, this, omission, was, mostly, for, practical, reasons, for, instance, it, would, not, be, very, accurate, and, additionally, it, would, require, much, time, for, women, to, disassemble, and, reassemble, their, hair, and, bonnets, the, patrons, would, then, be, given, a, souvenir, containing, all, their, biological, data, while, galton, would, also, keep, a, copy, for, future, statistical, research, although, the, laboratory, did, not, employ, any, revolutionary, measurement, techniques, it, was, unique, because, of, the, simple, logistics, of, constructing, such, a, demonstration, within, a, limited, space, and, because, of, the, speed, and, efficiency, with, which, all, the, necessary, data, were, gathered, the, laboratory, itself, was, a, see, through, lattice, walled, fenced, off, gallery, measuring, 36, feet, long, by, 6, feet, long, to, collect, data, efficiently, galton, had, to, make, the, process, as, simple, as, possible, for, people, to, understand, as, a, result, subjects, were, taken, through, the, laboratory, in, pairs, so, that, explanations, could, be, given, to, two, at, a, time, also, in, the, hope, that, one, of, the, two, would, confidently, take, the, initiative, to, go, through, all, the, tests, first, encouraging, the, other, with, this, design, the, total, time, spent, in, the, exhibit, was, fourteen, minutes, for, each, pair, galton, states, that, the, measurements, of, human, characteristics, are, useful, for, two, reasons, first, he, states, that, measuring, physical, characteristics, is, useful, in, order, to, ensure, on, a, more, domestic, level, that, children, are, developing, properly, a, useful, example, he, gives, for, the, practicality, of, these, domestic, measurements, is, regularly, checking, a, child, s, eyesight, in, order, to, correct, any, deficiencies, early, on, the, second, use, for, the, data, from, his, anthropometric, laboratory, is, for, statistical, studies, he, comments, on, the, usefulness, of, the, collected, data, to, compare, attributes, across, occupations, residences, races, etc, the, exhibit, at, the, health, exhibition, allowed, galton, to, collect, a, large, amount, of, raw, data, from, which, to, conduct, further, comparative, studies, he, had, 9, 337, respondents, each, measured, in, 17, categories, creating, a, rather, comprehensive, statistical, database, after, the, conclusion, of, the, international, health, exhibition, galton, used, these, data, to, confirm, in, humans, his, theory, of, linear, regression, posed, after, studying, sweet, peas, the, accumulation, of, this, human, data, allowed, him, to, observe, the, correlation, between, forearm, length, and, height, head, width, and, head, breadth, and, head, length, and, height, with, these, observations, he, was, able, to, write, co, relations, and, their, measurements, chiefly, from, anthropometric, data, in, this, publication, galton, defined, what, co, relation, as, a, phenomenon, that, occurs, when, the, variation, of, the, one, is, accompanied, on, the, average, by, more, or, less, variation, of, the, other, and, in, the, same, direction, the, method, used, in, hereditary, genius, has, been, described, as, the, first, example, of, historiometry, to, bolster, these, results, and, to, attempt, to, make, a, distinction, between, nature, and, nurture, he, was, the, first, to, apply, this, phrase, to, the, topic, he, devised, a, questionnaire, that, he, sent, out, to, 190, fellows, of, the, royal, society, he, tabulated, characteristics, of, their, families, such, as, birth, order, and, the, occupation, and, race, of, their, parents, he, attempted, to, discover, whether, their, interest, in, science, was, innate, or, due, to, the, encouragements, of, others, the, studies, were, published, as, a, book, english, men, of, science, their, nature, and, nurture, in, 1874, in, the, end, it, promoted, the, nature, versus, nurture, question, though, it, did, not, settle, it, and, provided, some, fascinating, data, on, the, sociology, of, scientists, of, the, time, galton, was, the, first, scientist, to, recognise, what, is, now, known, as, the, lexical, hypothesis, this, is, the, idea, that, the, most, salient, and, socially, relevant, personality, differences, in, people, s, lives, will, eventually, become, encoded, into, language, the, hypothesis, further, suggests, that, by, sampling, language, it, is, possible, to, derive, a, comprehensive, taxonomy, of, human, personality, traits, galton, s, inquiries, into, the, mind, involved, detailed, recording, of, people, s, subjective, accounts, of, whether, and, how, their, minds, dealt, with, phenomena, such, as, mental, imagery, to, better, elicit, this, information, he, pioneered, the, use, of, the, questionnaire, in, one, study, he, asked, his, fellow, members, of, the, royal, society, of, london, to, describe, mental, images, that, they, experienced, in, another, he, collected, in, depth, surveys, from, eminent, scientists, for, a, work, examining, the, effects, of, nature, and, nurture, on, the, propensity, toward, scientific, thinking, core, to, any, statistical, analysis, is, the, concept, that, measurements, vary, they, have, both, a, central, tendency, or, mean, and, a, spread, around, this, central, value, or, variance, in, the, late, 1860s, galton, conceived, of, a, measure, to, quantify, normal, variation, the, standard, deviation, galton, was, a, keen, observer, in, 1906, visiting, a, livestock, fair, he, stumbled, upon, an, intriguing, contest, an, ox, was, on, display, and, the, villagers, were, invited, to, guess, the, animal, s, weight, after, it, was, slaughtered, and, dressed, nearly, 800, participated, and, galton, was, able, to, study, their, individual, entries, after, the, event, galton, stated, that, the, middlemost, estimate, expresses, the, vox, populi, every, other, estimate, being, condemned, as, too, low, or, too, high, by, a, majority, of, the, voters, and, reported, this, value, the, median, in, terminology, he, himself, had, introduced, but, chose, not, to, use, on, this, occasion, as, 1, 207, pounds, to, his, surprise, this, was, within, 0, 8, of, the, weight, measured, by, the, judges, soon, afterwards, in, response, to, an, enquiry, he, reported, the, mean, of, the, guesses, as, 1, 197, pounds, but, did, not, comment, on, its, improved, accuracy, recent, archival, research, has, found, some, slips, in, transmitting, galton, s, calculations, to, the, original, article, in, nature, the, median, was, actually, 1, 208, pounds, and, the, dressed, weight, of, the, ox, 1, 197, pounds, so, the, mean, estimate, had, zero, error, james, surowiecki, uses, this, weight, judging, competition, as, his, opening, example, had, he, known, the, true, result, his, conclusion, on, the, wisdom, of, the, crowd, would, no, doubt, have, been, more, strongly, expressed, the, same, year, galton, suggested, in, a, letter, to, the, journal, nature, a, better, method, of, cutting, a, round, cake, by, avoiding, making, radial, incisions, studying, variation, galton, invented, the, galton, board, a, pachinko, like, device, also, known, as, the, bean, machine, as, a, tool, for, demonstrating, the, law, of, error, and, the, normal, distribution, he, also, discovered, the, properties, of, the, bivariate, normal, distribution, and, its, relationship, to, correlation, and, regression, analysis, in, 1846, the, french, physicist, auguste, bravais, 1811, 1863, first, developed, what, would, become, the, correlation, coefficient, after, examining, forearm, and, height, measurements, galton, independently, rediscovered, the, concept, of, correlation, in, 1888, and, demonstrated, its, application, in, the, study, of, heredity, anthropology, and, psychology, galton, s, later, statistical, study, of, the, probability, of, extinction, of, surnames, led, to, the, concept, of, galton, watson, stochastic, processes, galton, invented, the, use, of, the, regression, line, and, for, the, choice, of, r, for, reversion, or, regression, to, represent, the, correlation, coefficient, in, the, 1870s, and, 1880s, he, was, a, pioneer, in, the, use, of, normal, theory, to, fit, histograms, and, ogives, to, actual, tabulated, data, much, of, which, he, collected, himself, for, instance, large, samples, of, sibling, and, parental, height, consideration, of, the, results, from, these, empirical, studies, led, to, his, further, insights, into, evolution, natural, selection, and, regression, to, the, mean, galton, was, the, first, to, describe, and, explain, the, common, phenomenon, of, regression, toward, the, mean, which, he, first, observed, in, his, experiments, on, the, size, of, the, seeds, of, successive, generations, of, sweet, peas, the, conditions, under, which, regression, toward, the, mean, occurs, depend, on, the, way, the, term, is, mathematically, defined, galton, first, observed, the, phenomenon, in, the, context, of, simple, linear, regression, of, data, points, galton, developed, the, following, model, pellets, fall, through, a, quincunx, or, bean, machine, forming, a, normal, distribution, centred, directly, under, their, entrance, point, these, pellets, could, then, be, released, down, into, a, second, gallery, corresponding, to, a, second, measurement, occasion, galton, then, asked, the, reverse, question, from, where, did, these, pellets, come, the, answer, was, not, on, average, directly, above, rather, it, was, on, average, more, towards, the, middle, for, the, simple, reason, that, there, were, more, pellets, above, it, towards, the, middle, that, could, wander, left, than, there, were, in, the, left, extreme, that, could, wander, to, the, right, inwards, galton, went, beyond, measurement, and, summary, to, attempt, to, explain, the, phenomena, he, observed, among, such, developments, he, proposed, an, early, theory, of, ranges, of, sound, and, hearing, and, collected, large, quantities, of, anthropometric, data, from, the, public, through, his, popular, and, long, running, anthropometric, laboratory, which, he, established, in, 1884, and, where, he, studied, over, 9, 000, people, it, was, not, until, 1985, that, these, data, were, analysed, in, their, entirety, he, made, a, beauty, map, of, britain, based, on, a, secret, grading, of, the, local, women, on, a, scale, from, attractive, to, repulsive, the, lowest, point, was, in, aberdeen, galton, s, study, of, human, abilities, ultimately, led, to, the, foundation, of, differential, psychology, and, the, formulation, of, the, first, mental, tests, he, was, interested, in, measuring, humans, in, every, way, possible, this, included, measuring, their, ability, to, make, sensory, discrimination, which, he, assumed, was, linked, to, intellectual, prowess, galton, suggested, that, individual, differences, in, general, ability, are, reflected, in, performance, on, relatively, simple, sensory, capacities, and, in, speed, of, reaction, to, a, stimulus, variables, that, could, be, objectively, measured, by, tests, of, sensory, discrimination, and, reaction, time, he, also, measured, how, quickly, people, reacted, which, he, later, linked, to, internal, wiring, which, ultimately, limited, intelligence, ability, throughout, his, research, galton, assumed, that, people, who, reacted, faster, were, more, intelligent, than, others, galton, also, devised, a, technique, called, composite, portraiture, produced, by, superimposing, multiple, photographic, portraits, of, individuals, faces, registered, on, their, eyes, to, create, an, average, face, see, averageness, in, the, 1990s, a, hundred, years, after, his, discovery, much, psychological, research, has, examined, the, attractiveness, of, these, faces, an, aspect, that, galton, had, remarked, on, in, his, original, lecture, others, including, sigmund, freud, in, his, work, on, dreams, picked, up, galton, s, suggestion, that, these, composites, might, represent, a, useful, metaphor, for, an, ideal, type, or, a, concept, of, a, natural, kind, see, eleanor, rosch, such, as, jewish, men, criminals, patients, with, tuberculosis, etc, onto, the, same, photographic, plate, thereby, yielding, a, blended, whole, or, composite, that, he, hoped, could, generalise, the, facial, appearance, of, his, subject, into, an, average, or, central, type, see, also, entry, modern, physiognomy, under, physiognomy, this, work, began, in, the, 1880s, while, the, jewish, scholar, joseph, jacobs, studied, anthropology, and, statistics, with, francis, galton, jacobs, asked, galton, to, create, a, composite, photograph, of, a, jewish, type, one, of, jacobs, first, publications, that, used, galton, s, composite, imagery, was, the, jewish, type, and, galton, s, composite, photographs, photographic, news, 29, 24, april, 1885, 268, 269, galton, hoped, his, technique, would, aid, medical, diagnosis, and, even, criminology, through, the, identification, of, typical, criminal, faces, however, his, technique, did, not, prove, useful, and, fell, into, disuse, although, after, much, work, on, it, including, by, photographers, lewis, hine, and, john, l, lovell, and, arthur, batut, the, method, of, identifying, criminals, by, their, fingerprints, had, been, introduced, in, the, 1860s, by, sir, william, james, herschel, in, india, and, their, potential, use, in, forensic, work, was, first, proposed, by, dr, henry, faulds, in, 1880, galton, was, introduced, to, the, field, by, his, half, cousin, charles, darwin, who, was, a, friend, of, faulds, and, he, went, on, to, create, the, first, scientific, footing, for, the, study, which, assisted, its, acceptance, by, the, courts, although, galton, did, not, ever, give, credit, that, the, original, idea, was, not, his, in, a, royal, institution, paper, in, 1888, and, three, books, finger, prints, 1892, decipherment, of, blurred, finger, prints, 1893, and, fingerprint, directories, 1895, galton, estimated, the, probability, of, two, persons, having, the, same, fingerprint, and, studied, the, heritability, and, racial, differences, in, fingerprints, he, wrote, about, the, technique, inadvertently, sparking, a, controversy, between, herschel, and, faulds, that, was, to, last, until, 1917, identifying, common, pattern, in, fingerprints, and, devising, a, classification, system, that, survives, to, this, day, he, described, and, classified, them, into, eight, broad, categories, 1, plain, arch, 2, tented, arch, 3, simple, loop, 4, central, pocket, loop, 5, double, loop, 6, lateral, pocket, loop, 7, plain, whorl, and, 8, accidental, in, 1873, galton, wrote, a, letter, to, the, times, titled, africa, for, the, chinese, where, he, argued, that, the, chinese, as, a, race, capable, of, high, civilization, and, only, temporarily, stunted, by, the, recent, failures, of, chinese, dynasties, should, be, encouraged, to, immigrate, to, africa, and, displace, the, inferior, aboriginal, blacks, according, to, an, editorial, in, nature, galton, also, constructed, a, racial, hierarchy, in, which, white, people, were, considered, superior, he, wrote, that, the, average, intellectual, standard, of, the, negro, race, is, some, two, grades, below, our, own, the, anglo, saxon, according, to, the, encyclopedia, of, genocide, galton, bordered, on, the, justification, of, genocide, when, he, stated, there, exists, a, sentiment, for, the, most, part, quite, unreasonable, against, the, gradual, extinction, of, an, inferior, race, in, an, effort, to, reach, a, wider, audience, galton, worked, on, a, novel, entitled, kantsaywhere, from, may, until, december, 1910, the, novel, described, a, utopia, organized, by, a, eugenic, religion, designed, to, breed, fitter, and, smarter, humans, his, unpublished, notebooks, show, that, this, was, an, expansion, of, material, he, had, been, composing, since, at, least, 1901, he, offered, it, to, methuen, for, publication, but, they, showed, little, enthusiasm, galton, wrote, to, his, niece, that, it, should, be, either, smothered, or, superseded, his, niece, appears, to, have, burnt, most, of, the, novel, offended, by, the, love, scenes, but, large, fragments, survived, and, it, was, published, online, by, university, college, london, in, january, 1853, galton, met, louisa, jane, butler, 1822, 1897, at, his, neighbour, s, home, and, they, were, married, on, 1, august, 1853, the, union, of, 43, years, proved, childless, it, has, been, written, of, galton, that, on, his, own, estimation, he, was, a, supremely, intelligent, man, later, in, life, galton, proposed, a, connection, between, genius, and, insanity, based, on, his, own, experience, men, who, leave, their, mark, on, the, world, are, very, often, those, who, being, gifted, and, full, of, nervous, power, are, at, the, same, time, haunted, and, driven, by, a, dominant, idea, and, are, therefore, within, a, measurable, distance, of, insanity, attestations, and, descriptions, of, galton, s, character, were, made, by, beatrice, webb, james, arthur, harris, and, karl, pearson, galton, is, buried, in, the, family, tomb, in, the, churchyard, of, st, michael, and, all, angels, in, the, village, of, claverdon, warwickshire, over, the, course, of, his, career, galton, received, many, awards, including, the, copley, medal, of, the, royal, society, 1910, he, received, in, 1853, the, founder, s, medal, the, highest, award, of, the, royal, geographical, society, for, his, explorations, and, map, making, of, southwest, africa, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, athenaeum, club, in, 1855, and, made, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, in, 1860, his, autobiography, also, lists, galton, was, knighted, in, 1909, the, king, has, also, been, pleased, by, letters, patent, under, the, great, seal, of, the, united, kingdom, of, great, britain, and, ireland, bearing, date, the, 26th, june, 1909, to, confer, the, dignity, of, a, knight, of, the, said, united, kingdom, upon, francis, galton, esq, sc, d, f, r, s, honorary, fellow, of, trinity, college, cambridge, his, statistical, heir, karl, pearson, first, holder, of, the, galton, chair, of, eugenics, at, university, college, london, now, galton, chair, of, genetics, wrote, a, three, volume, biography, of, galton, in, four, parts, after, his, death, the, flowering, plant, genus, galtonia, was, named, after, galton, university, college, london, has, in, the, twenty, first, century, been, involved, in, a, historical, inquiry, into, its, role, as, the, institutional, birthplace, of, eugenics, galton, established, a, laboratory, at, ucl, in, 1904, some, students, and, staff, have, called, on, the, university, to, rename, its, galton, lecture, theatre, with, journalist, angela, saini, stating, galton, s, seductive, promise, was, of, a, bold, new, world, filled, only, with, beautiful, intelligent, productive, people, the, scientists, in, its, thrall, claimed, this, could, be, achieved, by, controlling, reproduction, policing, borders, to, prevent, certain, types, of, immigrants, and, locking, away, undesirables, including, disabled, people, in, june, 2020, university, college, london, ucl, announced, the, renaming, of, a, lecture, theatre, named, after, galton, because, of, his, connection, with, eugenics
