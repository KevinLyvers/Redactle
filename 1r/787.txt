book, philosophical, investigations, a, 1999, survey, among, american, university, and, college, teachers, ranked, the, investigations, as, the, most, important, book, of, 20th, century, philosophy, standing, out, as, the, one, crossover, masterpiece, in, twentieth, century, philosophy, appealing, across, diverse, specializations, and, philosophical, orientations, his, philosophy, is, often, divided, into, an, early, period, exemplified, by, the, tractatus, and, a, later, period, articulated, primarily, in, the, philosophical, investigations, the, early, wittgenstein, was, concerned, with, the, logical, relationship, between, propositions, and, the, world, and, he, believed, that, by, providing, an, account, of, the, logic, underlying, this, relationship, he, had, solved, all, philosophical, problems, the, later, wittgenstein, however, rejected, many, of, the, assumptions, of, the, tractatus, arguing, that, the, meaning, of, words, is, best, understood, as, their, use, within, a, given, language, game, born, in, vienna, into, one, of, europe, s, richest, families, he, inherited, a, fortune, from, his, father, in, 1913, before, world, war, i, he, made, a, very, generous, financial, bequest, to, a, group, of, poets, and, artists, chosen, by, ludwig, von, ficker, the, editor, of, der, brenner, from, artists, in, need, these, included, trakl, as, well, as, rainer, maria, rilke, and, the, architect, adolf, loos, later, in, a, period, of, severe, personal, depression, after, world, war, i, he, gave, away, his, remaining, fortune, to, his, brothers, and, sisters, three, of, his, four, older, brothers, died, by, separate, acts, of, suicide, wittgenstein, left, academia, several, times, serving, as, an, officer, on, the, front, line, during, world, war, i, where, he, was, decorated, a, number, of, times, for, his, courage, teaching, in, schools, in, remote, austrian, villages, where, he, encountered, controversy, for, using, sometimes, violent, corporal, punishment, on, both, girls, and, boys, see, for, example, the, haidbauer, incident, especially, during, mathematics, classes, working, during, world, war, ii, as, a, hospital, porter, in, london, and, working, as, a, hospital, laboratory, technician, at, the, royal, victoria, infirmary, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, he, later, expressed, remorse, for, these, incidents, and, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, lecturing, and, attempting, to, prepare, a, second, manuscript, for, publication, which, was, published, posthumously, as, the, hugely, influential, philosophical, investigations, according, to, a, family, tree, prepared, in, jerusalem, after, world, war, ii, wittgenstein, s, paternal, great, great, grandfather, was, moses, meier, an, ashkenazi, jewish, land, agent, who, lived, with, his, wife, brendel, simon, in, bad, laasphe, in, the, principality, of, wittgenstein, westphalia, in, july, 1808, napoleon, issued, a, decree, that, everyone, including, jews, must, adopt, an, inheritable, family, surname, so, meier, s, son, also, moses, took, the, name, of, his, employers, the, sayn, wittgensteins, and, became, moses, meier, wittgenstein, his, son, hermann, christian, wittgenstein, who, took, the, middle, name, christian, to, distance, himself, from, his, jewish, background, married, fanny, figdor, also, jewish, who, converted, to,

was, one, of, the, richest, men, in, europe, with, an, effective, monopoly, on, austria, s, steel, cartel, thanks, to, karl, the, wittgensteins, became, the, second, wealthiest, family, in, the, austro, hungarian, empire, only, the, rothschilds, being, wealthier, karl, wittgenstein, was, viewed, as, the, austrian, equivalent, of, andrew, carnegie, with, whom, he, was, friends, and, was, one, of, the, wealthiest, men, in, the, world, by, the, 1890s, as, a, result, of, his, decision, in, 1898, to, invest, substantially, in, the, netherlands, and, in, switzerland, as, well, as, overseas, particularly, in, the, us, the, family, was, to, an, extent, shielded, from, the, hyperinflation, that, hit, austria, in, 1922, however, their, wealth, diminished, due, to, post, 1918, hyperinflation, and, subsequently, during, the, great, depression, although, even, as, late, as, 1938, they, owned, 13, mansions, in, vienna, alone, wittgenstein, was, ethnically, jewish, his, mother, was, leopoldine, maria, josefa, kalmus, known, among, friends, as, poldi, her, father, was, a, bohemian, jew, and, her, mother, was, an, austrian, slovene, catholic, she, was, wittgenstein, s, only, non,

environment, the, family, was, at, the, centre, of, vienna, s, cultural, life, bruno, walter, described, the, life, at, the, wittgensteins, palace, as, an, all, pervading, atmosphere, of, humanity, and, culture, karl, was, a, leading, patron, of, the, arts, commissioning, works, by, auguste, rodin, and, financing, the, city, s, exhibition, hall, and, art, gallery, the, secession, building,

rooms, wittgenstein, who, valued, precision, and, discipline, never, considered, contemporary, classical, music, acceptable, he, said, to, his, friend, drury, in, 1930, music, came, to, a, full, stop, with, brahms, and, even, in, brahms, i, can, begin, to, hear, the, noise, of, machinery, ludwig, wittgenstein, himself, had, absolute, pitch, and, his, devotion, to, music, remained, vitally, important, to, him, throughout, his, life, he, made, frequent, use, of, musical, examples, and, metaphors, in, his, philosophical, writings, and, he, was, unusually, adept, at, whistling, lengthy, and, detailed, musical, passages, he, also, learnt, to, play, the, clarinet, in, his, 30s, a, fragment, of, music, three, bars, composed, by, wittgenstein, was, discovered, in, one, of, his, 1931, notebooks, by, michael, nedo, director, of, the, wittgenstein, institute, in, cambridge, ray, monk, writes, that, karl, s, aim, was, to, turn, his, sons, into, captains, of, industry, they, were, not, sent, to, school, lest, they, acquire, bad, habits, but, were, educated, at, home, to, prepare, them, for, work, in, karl, s, industrial, empire, three, of, the, five, brothers, later, committed, suicide, psychiatrist, michael, fitzgerald, argues, that, karl, was, a, harsh, perfectionist, who, lacked, empathy, and, that, wittgenstein, s, mother, was, anxious, and, insecure, unable, to, stand, up, to, her, husband, johannes, brahms, said, of, the, family, whom, he, visited, regularly, they, seemed, to, act, towards, one, another, as, if, they, were, at, court, the, family, appeared, to, have, a, strong, streak, of, depression, running, through, it, anthony, gottlieb, tells, a, story, about, paul, practising, on, one, of, the, pianos, in, the, wittgensteins, main, family, mansion, when, he, suddenly, shouted, at, ludwig, in, the, next, room, i, cannot, play, when, you, are, in, the, house, as, i, feel, your, skepticism, seeping, towards, me, from, under, the, door, the, family, palace, housed, seven, grand, pianos, and, each, of, the, siblings, pursued, music, with, an, enthusiasm, that, at, times, bordered, on, the, pathological, the, eldest, brother, hans, was, hailed, as, a, musical, prodigy, at, the, age, of, four, writes, alexander, waugh, hans, could, identify, the, doppler, effect, in, a, passing, siren, as, a, quarter, tone, drop, in, pitch, and, at, five, started, crying, wrong, wrong, when, two, brass, bands, in, a, carnival, played, the, same, tune, in, different, keys, but, he, died, in, mysterious, circumstances, in, may, 1902, when, he, ran, away, to, the, us, and, disappeared, from, a, boat, in, chesapeake, bay, most, likely, having, committed, suicide, two, years, later, aged, 22, and, studying, chemistry, at, the, berlin, academy, the,

forsaken, am, i, before, mixing, himself, a, drink, of, milk, and, potassium, cyanide, he, had, left, several, suicide, notes, one, to, his, parents, that, said, he, was, grieving, over, the, death, of, a, friend, and, another, that, referred, to, his, perverted, disposition, it, was, reported, at, the, time, that, he, had, sought, advice, from, the, scientific, humanitarian, committee, an, organization, that, was, campaigning, against, paragraph, 175, of, the, german, criminal, code, which, prohibited, homosexual, sex, ludwig, himself, was, a, closeted, homosexual, who, separated, sexual, intercourse, from, love, despising, all, forms, of, the, former, his, father, forbade, the, family, from, ever, mentioning, his, name, again, the, second, eldest, brother, kurt, an, officer, and, company, director, shot, himself, on, 27, october, 1918, just, before, the, end, of, world, war, i, when, the, austrian, troops, he, was, commanding, refused, to, obey, his, orders, and, deserted, en, masse, according, to, gottlieb, hermine, had, said, kurt, seemed, to, carry, the, germ, of, disgust, for, life, within, himself, later, ludwig, wrote, i, ought, to, have, become, a, star, in, the, sky, instead, of, which, i, have, remained, stuck, on, earth, wittgenstein, was, taught, by, private, tutors, at, home, until, he, was, 14, years, old, subsequently, for, three, years, he, attended, a, school, after, the, deaths, of, hans, and, rudi, karl, relented, and, allowed, paul, and, ludwig, to, be, sent, to, school, waugh, writes, that, it, was, too, late, for, wittgenstein, to, pass, his, exams, for, the, more, academic, gymnasium, in, wiener, neustadt, having, had, no, formal, schooling, he, failed, his, entrance, exam, and, only, barely, managed, after, extra, tutoring, to, pass, the, exam, for, the, more, technically, oriented, k, u, k, realschule, in, linz, a, small, state, school, with, 300, pupils, in, 1903, when, he, was, 14, he, began, his, three, years, of, formal, schooling, there, lodging, nearby, in, term, time, with, the, family, of, dr, josef, strigl, a, teacher, at, the, local, gymnasium, the, family, giving, him, the, nickname, luki, on, starting, at, the, realschule, wittgenstein, had, been, moved, forward, a, year, historian, brigitte, hamann, writes, that, he, stood, out, from, the, other, boys, he, spoke, an, unusually, pure, form, of, high, german, with, a, stutter, dressed, elegantly, and, was, sensitive, and, unsociable, monk, writes, that, the, other, boys, made, fun, of, him, singing, after, him, wittgenstein, wandelt, wehm, tig, widriger, winde, wegen, wienw, rts, wittgenstein, wanders, wistfully, vienna, wards, in, worsening, winds, in, his, leaving, certificate, he, received, a, top, mark, 5, in, religious, studies, a, 2, for, conduct, and, english, 3, for, french, geography, history, mathematics, and, physics, and, 4, for, german, chemistry, geometry, and, freehand, drawing, he, had, particular, difficulty, with, spelling, and, failed, his, written, german, exam, because, of, it, he, wrote, in, 1931, my, bad, spelling, in, youth, up, to, the, age, of, about, 18, or, 19, is, connected, with, the, whole, of, the, rest, of, my, character, my, weakness, in, study, wittgenstein, was, baptized, as, an, infant, by, a, catholic, priest, and, received, formal, instruction, in, catholic, doctrine, as, a, child, as, was, common, at, the, time, in, an, interview, his, sister, gretl, stonborough, wittgenstein, says, that, their, grandfather, s, strong, severe, partly, ascetic, christianity, was, a, strong, influence, on, all, the, wittgenstein, children, while, he, was, at, the, realschule, he, decided, he, lacked, religious, faith, and, began, reading, arthur, schopenhauer, per, gretl, s, recommendation, he, nevertheless, believed, in, the, importance, of, the, idea, of, confession, he, wrote, in, his, diaries, about, having, made, a, major, confession, to, his, oldest, sister, hermine, while, he, was, at, the, realschule, monk, speculates, that, it, may, have, been, about, his, loss, of, faith, he, also, discussed, it, with, gretl, his, other, sister, who, directed, him, to, schopenhauer, s, the, world, as, will, and, representation, as, a, teenager, wittgenstein, adopted, schopenhauer, s, epistemological, idealism, however, after, his, study, of, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, he, abandoned, epistemological, idealism, for, gottlob, frege, s, conceptual, realism, in, later, years, wittgenstein, was, highly, dismissive, of, schopenhauer, describing, him, as, an, ultimately, shallow, thinker, schopenhauer, is, quite, a, crude, mind, where, real, depth, starts, his, comes, to, an, end, wittgenstein, s, relationship, with, christianity, and, with, religion, in, general, for, which, he, always, professed, a, sincere, and, devoted, sympathy, changed, over, time, much, like, his, philosophical, ideas, in, 1912, wittgenstein, wrote, to, russell, saying, that, mozart, and, beethoven, were, the, actual, sons, of, god, however, wittgenstein, resisted, formal, religion, saying, it, was, hard, for, him, to, bend, the, knee, though, his, grandfather, s, beliefs, continued, to, influence, wittgenstein, as, he, said, i, cannot, help, seeing, every, problem, from, a, religious, point, of, view, wittgenstein, referred, to, augustine, of, hippo, in, his, philosophical, investigations, philosophically, wittgenstein, s, thought, shows, alignment, with, religious, discourse, for, example, he, would, become, one, of, the, century, s, fiercest, critics, of, scientism, wittgenstein, s, religious, belief, emerged, during, his, service, for, the, austrian, army, in, world, war, i, and, he, was, a, devoted, reader, of, dostoevsky, s, and, tolstoy, s, religious, writings, he, viewed, his, wartime, experiences, as, a, trial, in, which, he, strove, to, conform, to, the, will, of, god, and, in, a, journal, entry, from, 29, april, 1915, he, writes, perhaps, the, nearness, of, death, will, bring, me, the, light, of, life, may, god, enlighten, me, i, am, a, worm, but, through, god, i, become, a, man, god, be, with, me, amen, around, this, time, wittgenstein, wrote, that, christianity, is, indeed, the, only, sure, way, to, happiness, but, he, rejected, the, idea, that, religious, belief, was, merely, thinking, that, a, certain, doctrine, was, true, from, this, time, on, wittgenstein, viewed, religious, faith, as, a, way, of, living, and, opposed, rational, argumentation, or, proofs, for, god, with, age, a, deepening, personal, spirituality, led, to, several, elucidations, and, clarifications, as, he, untangled, language, problems, in, religion, attacking, for, example, the, temptation, to, think, of, god, s, existence, as, a, matter, of, scientific, evidence, in, 1947, finding, it, more, difficult, to, work, he, wrote, i, have, had, a, letter, from, an, old, friend, in, austria, a, priest, in, it, he, says, that, he, hopes, my, work, will, go, well, if, it, should, be, god, s, will, now, that, is, all, i, want, if, it, should, be, god, s, will, in, culture, and, value, wittgenstein, writes, is, what, i, am, doing, really, worth, the, effort, yes, but, only, if, a, light, shines, on, it, from, above, his, close, friend, norman, malcolm, wrote, wittgenstein, s, mature, life, was, strongly, marked, by, religious, thought, and, feeling, i, am, inclined, to, think, that, he, was, more, deeply, religious, than, are, many, people, who, correctly, regard, themselves, as, religious, believers, toward, the, end, wittgenstein, wrote, bach, wrote, on, the, title, page, of, his, orgelb, chlein, to, the, glory, of, the, most, high, god, and, that, my, neighbour, may, be, benefited, thereby, that, is, what, i, would, have, liked, to, say, about, my, work, while, a, student, at, the, realschule, wittgenstein, was, influenced, by, austrian, philosopher, otto, weininger, s, 1903, book, geschlecht, und, charakter, sex, and, character, weininger, 1880, 1903, who, was, jewish, argued, that, the, concepts, male, and, female, exist, only, as, platonic, forms, and, that, jews, tend, to, embody, the, platonic, femininity, whereas, men, are, basically, rational, women, operate, only, at, the, level, of, their, emotions, and, sexual, organs, jews, weininger, argued, are, similar, saturated, with, femininity, with, no, sense, of, right, and, wrong, and, no, soul, weininger, argues, that, man, must, choose, between, his, masculine, and, feminine, sides, consciousness, and, unconsciousness, platonic, love, and, sexuality, love, and, sexual, desire, stand, in, contradiction, and, love, between, a, woman, and, a, man, is, therefore, doomed, to, misery, or, immorality, the, only, life, worth, living, is, the, spiritual, one, to, live, as, a, woman, or, a, jew, means, one, has, no, right, to, live, at, all, the, choice, is, genius, or, death, weininger, committed, suicide, shooting, himself, in, 1903, shortly, after, publishing, the, book, wittgenstein, then, 14, attended, weininger, s, funeral, many, years, later, as, a, professor, at, the, university, of, cambridge, wittgenstein, distributed, copies, of, weininger, s, book, to, his, bemused, academic, colleagues, he, said, that, weininger, s, arguments, were, wrong, but, that, it, was, the, way, they, were, wrong, that, was, interesting, in, a, letter, dated, 23, august, 1931, wittgenstein, wrote, the, following, to, g, e, moore, dear, moore, thanks, for, your, letter, i, can, quite, imagine, that, you, don, t, admire, weininger, very, much, what, with, that, beastly, translation, and, the, fact, that, w, must, feel, very, foreign, to, you, it, is, true, that, he, is, fantastic, but, he, is, great, and, fantastic, it, isn, t, necessary, or, rather, not, possible, to, agree, with, him, but, the, greatness, lies, in, that, with, which, we, disagree, it, is, his, enormous, mistake, which, is, great, i, e, roughly, speaking, if, you, just, add, a, to, the, whole, book, it, says, an, important, truth, in, an, unusual, move, wittgenstein, took, out, a, copy, of, weininger, s, work, on, 1, june, 1931, from, the, special, order, books, in, the, university, library, he, met, moore, on, 2, june, when, he, probably, gave, this, copy, to, moore, despite, their, and, their, forebears, christianization, the, wittgensteins, considered, themselves, jewish, this, was, evident, during, the, nazi, era, when, ludwig, s, sister, was, assured, by, an, official, that, they, wouldn, t, be, considered, as, jews, under, the, racial, laws, indignant, at, the, state, s, attempt, to, dictate, her, identity, she, demanded, papers, certifying, their, jewish, lineage, in, his, own, writings, wittgenstein, frequently, referred, to, himself, as, jewish, often, in, a, self, deprecating, manner, for, instance, while, criticizing, himself, for, being, a, reproductive, rather, than, productive, thinker, he, attributed, this, to, his, jewish, sense, of, identity, he, wrote, the, saint, is, the, only, jewish, genius, even, the, greatest, jewish, thinker, is, no, more, than, talented, myself, for, instance, there, is, much, discussion, around, the, extent, to, which, wittgenstein, and, his, siblings, who, were, of, 3, 4, jewish, descent, saw, themselves, as, jews, the, issue, has, arisen, in, particular, regarding, wittgenstein, s, schooldays, because, adolf, hitler, was, for, a, while, at, the, same, school, at, the, same, time, laurence, goldstein, argues, that, it, is, overwhelmingly, probable, that, the, boys, met, each, other, and, that, hitler, would, have, disliked, wittgenstein, a, stammering, precocious, precious, aristocratic, upstart, strathern, flatly, states, they, never, met, other, commentators, have, dismissed, as, irresponsible, and, uninformed, any, suggestion, that, wittgenstein, s, wealth, and, unusual, personality, might, have, fed, hitler, s, antisemitism, in, part, because, there, is, no, indication, that, hitler, would, have, seen, wittgenstein, as, jewish, wittgenstein, and, hitler, were, born, just, six, days, apart, though, hitler, had, to, re, sit, his, mathematics, exam, before, being, allowed, into, a, higher, class, while, wittgenstein, was, moved, forward, by, one, so, they, ended, up, two, grades, apart, at, the, realschule, monk, estimates, that, they, were, both, at, the, school, during, the, 1904, 1905, school, year, but, says, there, is, no, evidence, they, had, anything, to, do, with, each, other, several, commentators, have, argued, that, a, school, photograph, of, hitler, may, show, wittgenstein, in, the, lower, left, corner, while, wittgenstein, would, later, claim, that, y, thoughts, are, 100, hebraic, as, hans, sluga, has, argued, if, so, his, was, a, self, doubting, judaism, which, had, always, the, possibility, of, collapsing, into, a, destructive, self, hatred, as, it, did, in, weininger, s, case, but, which, also, held, an, immense, promise, of, innovation, and, genius, by, hebraic, he, meant, to, include, the, christian, tradition, in, contradistinction, to, the, greek, tradition, holding, that, good, and, evil, could, not, be, reconciled, he, began, his, studies, in, mechanical, engineering, at, the, technische, hochschule, berlin, in, charlottenburg, berlin, on, 23, october, 1906, lodging, with, the, family, of, professor, dr, jolles, he, attended, for, three, semesters, and, was, awarded, a, diploma, abgangzeugnis, on, 5, may, 1908, during, his, time, at, the, institute, wittgenstein, developed, an, interest, in, aeronautics, he, arrived, at, the, victoria, university, of, manchester, in, the, spring, of, 1908, to, study, for, a, doctorate, full, of, plans, for, aeronautical, projects, including, designing, and, flying, his, own, plane, he, conducted, research, into, the, behavior, of, kites, in, the, upper, atmosphere, experimenting, at, a, meteorological, observation, site, near, glossop, in, derbyshire, specifically, the, royal, meteorological, society, researched, and, investigated, the, ionization, of, the, upper, atmosphere, by, suspending, instruments, on, balloons, or, kites, at, glossop, wittgenstein, worked, under, professor, of, physics, sir, arthur, schuster, he, also, worked, on, the, design, of, a, propeller, with, small, jet, tip, jet, engines, on, the, end, of, its, blades, something, he, patented, in, 1911, and, that, earned, him, a, research, studentship, from, the, university, in, the, autumn, of, 1908, at, the, time, contemporary, propeller, designs, were, not, advanced, enough, to, actually, put, wittgenstein, s, ideas, into, practice, and, it, would, be, years, before, a, blade, design, that, could, support, wittgenstein, s, innovative, design, was, created, wittgenstein, s, design, required, air, and, gas, to, be, forced, along, the, propeller, arms, to, combustion, chambers, on, the, end, of, each, blade, where, they, were, then, compressed, by, the, centrifugal, force, exerted, by, the, revolving, arms, and, ignited, propellers, of, the, time, were, typically, wood, whereas, modern, blades, are, made, from, pressed, steel, laminates, as, separate, halves, which, are, then, welded, together, this, gives, the, blade, a, hollow, interior, and, thereby, creates, an, ideal, pathway, for, the, air, and, gas, work, on, the, jet, powered, propeller, proved, frustrating, for, wittgenstein, who, had, very, little, experience, working, with, machinery, jim, bamber, a, british, engineer, who, was, his, friend, and, classmate, at, the, time, reported, that, when, things, went, wrong, which, often, occurred, he, would, throw, his, arms, around, stomp, about, and, swear, volubly, in, german, according, to, william, eccles, another, friend, from, that, period, wittgenstein, then, turned, to, more, theoretical, work, focusing, on, the, design, of, the, propeller, a, problem, that, required, relatively, sophisticated, mathematics, it, was, at, this, time, that, he, became, interested, in, the, foundations, of, mathematics, particularly, after, reading, bertrand, russell, s, the, principles, of, mathematics, 1903, and, gottlob, frege, s, the, foundations, of, arithmetic, vol, 1, 1893, and, vol, 2, 1903, wittgenstein, s, sister, hermine, said, he, became, obsessed, with, mathematics, as, a, result, and, was, anyway, losing, interest, in, aeronautics, he, decided, instead, that, he, needed, to, study, logic, and, the, foundations, of, mathematics, describing, himself, as, in, a, constant, indescribable, almost, pathological, state, of, agitation, in, the, summer, of, 1911, he, visited, frege, at, the, university, of, jena, to, show, him, some, philosophy, of, mathematics, and, logic, he, had, written, and, to, ask, whether, it, was, worth, pursuing, he, wrote, i, was, shown, into, frege, s, study, frege, was, a, small, neat, man, with, a, pointed, beard, who, bounced, around, the, room, as, he, talked, he, absolutely, wiped, the, floor, with, me, and, i, felt, very, depressed, but, at, the, end, he, said, you, must, come, again, so, i, cheered, up, i, had, several, discussions, with, him, after, that, frege, would, never, talk, about, anything, but, logic, and, mathematics, if, i, started, on, some, other, subject, he, would, say, something, polite, and, then, plunge, back, into, logic, and, mathematics, wittgenstein, wanted, to, study, with, frege, but, frege, suggested, he, attend, the, university, of, cambridge, to, study, under, russell, so, on, 18, october, 1911, wittgenstein, arrived, unannounced, at, russell, s, rooms, in, trinity, college, russell, was, having, tea, with, c, k, ogden, when, according, to, russell, an, unknown, german, appeared, speaking, very, little, english, but, refusing, to, speak, german, he, turned, out, to, be, a, man, who, had, learned, engineering, at, charlottenburg, but, during, this, course, had, acquired, by, himself, a, passion, for, the, philosophy, of, mathematics, has, now, come, to, cambridge, on, purpose, to, hear, me, he, was, soon, not, only, attending, russell, s, lectures, but, dominating, them, the, lectures, were, poorly, attended, and, russell, often, found, himself, lecturing, only, to, c, d, broad, e, h, neville, and, h, t, j, norton, wittgenstein, started, following, him, after, lectures, back, to, his, rooms, to, discuss, more, philosophy, until, it, was, time, for, the, evening, meal, in, hall, russell, grew, irritated, he, wrote, to, his, lover, lady, ottoline, morrell, my, german, friend, threatens, to, be, an, infliction, russell, soon, came, to, believe, that, wittgenstein, was, a, genius, especially, after, he, had, examined, wittgenstein, s, written, work, he, wrote, in, november, 1911, that, he, had, at, first, thought, wittgenstein, might, be, a, crank, but, soon, decided, he, was, a, genius, some, of, his, early, views, made, the, decision, difficult, he, maintained, for, example, at, one, time, that, all, existential, propositions, are, meaningless, this, was, in, a, lecture, room, and, i, invited, him, to, consider, the, proposition, there, is, no, hippopotamus, in, this, room, at, present, when, he, refused, to, believe, this, i, looked, under, all, the, desks, without, finding, one, but, he, remained, unconvinced, three, months, after, wittgenstein, s, arrival, russell, told, morrell, i, love, him, feel, he, will, solve, the, problems, i, am, too, old, to, solve, he, is, the, young, man, one, hopes, for, wittgenstein, later, told, david, pinsent, that, russell, s, encouragement, had, proven, his, salvation, and, had, ended, nine, years, of, loneliness, and, suffering, during, which, he, had, continually, thought, of, suicide, in, encouraging, him, to, pursue, philosophy, and, in, justifying, his, inclination, to, abandon, engineering, russell, had, quite, literally, saved, wittgenstein, s, life, the, role, reversal, between, bertrand, russell, and, wittgenstein, was, soon, such, that, russell, wrote, in, 1916, after, wittgenstein, had, criticized, russell, s, own, work, his, criticism, tho, i, don, t, think, you, realized, it, at, the, time, was, an, event, of, first, rate, importance, in, my, life, and, affected, everything, i, have, done, since, i, saw, that, he, was, right, and, i, saw, that, i, could, not, hope, ever, again, to, do, fundamental, work, in, philosophy, in, 1912, wittgenstein, joined, the, cambridge, university, moral, sciences, club, an, influential, discussion, group, for, philosophy, dons, and, students, delivering, his, first, paper, there, on, 29, november, that, year, a, four, minute, talk, defining, philosophy, as, all, those, primitive, propositions, which, are, assumed, as, true, without, proof, by, the, various, sciences, he, dominated, the, society, and, for, a, time, would, stop, attending, in, the, early, 1930s, after, complaints, that, he, gave, no, one, else, a, chance, to, speak, the, club, became, infamous, within, popular, philosophy, because, of, a, meeting, on, 25, october, 1946, at, richard, braithwaite, s, rooms, in, king, s, college, cambridge, where, karl, popper, another, viennese, philosopher, had, been, invited, as, the, guest, speaker, popper, s, paper, was, are, there, philosophical, problems, in, which, he, struck, up, a, position, against, wittgenstein, s, contending, that, problems, in, philosophy, are, real, not, just, linguistic, puzzles, as, wittgenstein, argued, accounts, vary, as, to, what, happened, next, but, wittgenstein, apparently, started, waving, a, hot, poker, demanding, that, popper, give, him, an, example, of, a, moral, rule, popper, offered, one, not, to, threaten, visiting, speakers, with, pokers, at, which, point, russell, told, wittgenstein, he, had, misunderstood, and, wittgenstein, left, popper, maintained, that, wittgenstein, stormed, out, but, it, had, become, accepted, practice, for, him, to, leave, early, because, of, his, aforementioned, ability, to, dominate, discussion, it, was, the, only, time, the, philosophers, three, of, the, most, eminent, in, the, 20th, ce, were, ever, in, the, same, room, together, the, minutes, record, that, the, meeting, was, charged, to, an, unusual, degree, with, a, spirit, of, controversy, the, economist, john, maynard, keynes, also, invited, him, to, join, the, cambridge, apostles, an, elite, secret, society, formed, in, 1820, which, both, bertrand, russell, and, g, e, moore, had, joined, as, students, but, wittgenstein, did, not, greatly, enjoy, it, and, attended, only, infrequently, russell, had, been, worried, that, wittgenstein, would, not, appreciate, the, group, s, raucous, style, of, intellectual, debate, its, precious, sense, of, humour, and, the, fact, that, the, members, were, often, in, love, with, one, another, he, was, admitted, in, 1912, but, resigned, almost, immediately, because, he, could, not, tolerate, the, style, of, discussion, nevertheless, the, cambridge, apostles, allowed, wittgenstein, to, participate, in, meetings, again, in, the, 1920s, when, he, had, returned, to, cambridge, reportedly, wittgenstein, also, had, trouble, tolerating, the, discussions, in, the, cambridge, moral, sciences, club, wittgenstein, was, quite, vocal, about, his, depression, in, his, years, at, cambridge, and, before, he, went, to, war, on, many, an, occasion, he, told, russell, of, his, woes, his, mental, anguish, seemed, to, stem, from, two, sources, his, work, and, his, personal, life, wittgenstein, made, numerous, remarks, to, russell, about, logic, driving, him, mad, wittgenstein, also, stated, to, russell, that, he, felt, the, curse, of, those, who, have, half, a, talent, he, later, expressed, this, same, worry, and, told, of, being, in, mediocre, spirits, due, to, his, lack, of, progress, in, his, logical, work, monk, writes, that, wittgenstein, lived, and, breathed, logic, and, a, temporary, lack, of, inspiration, plunged, him, into, despair, wittgenstein, told, of, his, work, in, logic, affecting, his, mental, status, in, an, extreme, way, however, he, also, told, russell, another, story, around, christmas, in, 1913, he, wrote, how, can, i, be, a, logician, before, i, m, a, human, being, for, the, most, important, thing, is, coming, to, terms, with, myself, he, also, told, russell, on, an, occasion, in, russell, s, rooms, that, he, was, worried, about, logic, and, his, sins, also, once, upon, arriving, in, russell, s, rooms, one, night, wittgenstein, announced, to, russell, that, he, would, kill, himself, once, he, left, of, things, wittgenstein, personally, told, russell, ludwig, s, temperament, was, also, recorded, in, the, diary, of, david, pinsent, pinsent, wrote, i, have, to, be, frightfully, careful, and, tolerant, when, he, gets, these, sulky, fits, and, i, am, afraid, he, is, in, an, even, more, sensitive, neurotic, state, just, now, than, usual, when, talking, about, wittgenstein, s, emotional, fluctuations, wittgenstein, had, romantic, relations, with, both, men, and, women, he, is, generally, believed, to, have, fallen, in, love, with, at, least, three, men, and, had, a, relationship, with, the, latter, two, david, hume, pinsent, in, 1912, francis, skinner, in, 1930, and, ben, richards, in, the, late, 1940s, he, later, claimed, that, as, a, teenager, in, vienna, he, had, had, an, affair, with, a, woman, additionally, in, the, 1920s, wittgenstein, fell, in, love, with, a, young, swiss, woman, marguerite, respinger, sculpting, a, bust, modelled, on, her, and, seriously, considering, marriage, albeit, on, condition, that, they, would, not, have, children, she, decided, that, he, was, not, right, for, her, wittgenstein, s, relationship, with, david, pinsent, occurred, during, an, intellectually, formative, period, and, is, well, documented, bertrand, russell, introduced, wittgenstein, to, pinsent, in, the, summer, of, 1912, pinsent, was, a, mathematics, undergraduate, and, a, relation, of, david, hume, and, wittgenstein, and, he, soon, became, very, close, the, men, worked, together, on, experiments, in, the, psychology, laboratory, about, the, role, of, rhythm, in, the, appreciation, of, music, and, wittgenstein, delivered, a, paper, on, the, subject, to, the, british, psychological, association, in, cambridge, in, 1912, they, also, travelled, together, including, to, iceland, in, september, 1912, the, expenses, paid, by, wittgenstein, including, first, class, travel, the, hiring, of, a, private, train, and, new, clothes, and, spending, money, for, pinsent, in, addition, to, iceland, wittgenstein, and, pinsent, traveled, to, norway, in, 1913, in, determining, their, destination, wittgenstein, and, pinsent, visited, a, tourist, office, in, search, of, a, location, that, would, fulfill, the, following, criteria, a, small, village, located, on, a, fjord, a, location, away, from, tourists, and, a, peaceful, destination, to, allow, them, to, study, logic, and, law, choosing, ystese, wittgenstein, and, pinsent, arrived, in, the, small, village, on, 4, september, 1913, during, a, vacation, lasting, almost, three, weeks, wittgenstein, was, able, to, work, vigorously, on, his, studies, the, immense, progress, on, logic, during, their, stay, led, wittgenstein, to, express, to, pinsent, his, notion, of, leaving, cambridge, and, returning, to, norway, to, continue, his, work, on, logic, pinsent, s, diaries, provide, valuable, insights, into, wittgenstein, s, personality, sensitive, nervous, and, attuned, to, the, tiniest, slight, or, change, in, mood, from, pinsent, pinsent, also, writes, of, wittgenstein, being, absolutely, sulky, and, snappish, at, times, as, well, in, his, diaries, pinsent, wrote, about, shopping, for, furniture, with, wittgenstein, in, cambridge, when, the, latter, was, given, rooms, in, trinity, most, of, what, they, found, in, the, stores, was, not, minimalist, enough, for, wittgenstein, s, aesthetics, i, went, and, helped, him, interview, a, lot, of, furniture, at, various, shops, it, was, rather, amusing, he, is, terribly, fastidious, and, we, led, the, shopman, a, frightful, dance, vittgenstein, ejaculating, no, beastly, to, 90, percent, of, what, he, shewed, us, he, wrote, in, may, 1912, that, wittgenstein, had, just, begun, to, study, the, history, of, philosophy, he, expresses, the, most, naive, surprise, that, all, the, philosophers, he, once, worshipped, in, ignorance, are, after, all, stupid, and, dishonest, and, make, disgusting, mistakes, the, last, time, they, saw, each, other, was, on, 8, october, 1913, at, lordswood, house, in, birmingham, then, residence, of, the, pinsent, family, i, got, up, at, 6, 15, to, see, ludwig, off, he, had, to, go, very, early, back, to, cambridge, as, he, has, lots, to, do, there, i, saw, him, off, from, the, house, in, a, taxi, at, 7, 00, to, catch, a, 7, 30, am, train, from, new, street, station, it, was, sad, parting, from, him, wittgenstein, left, to, live, in, norway, karl, wittgenstein, died, on, 20, january, 1913, and, after, receiving, his, inheritance, wittgenstein, became, one, of, the, wealthiest, men, in, europe, he, donated, some, of, his, money, at, first, anonymously, to, austrian, artists, and, writers, including, rainer, maria, rilke, and, georg, trakl, trakl, requested, to, meet, his, benefactor, but, in, 1914, when, wittgenstein, went, to, visit, trakl, had, killed, himself, wittgenstein, came, to, feel, that, he, could, not, get, to, the, heart, of, his, most, fundamental, questions, while, surrounded, by, other, academics, and, so, in, 1913, he, retreated, to, the, village, of, skjolden, in, norway, where, he, rented, the, second, floor, of, a, house, for, the, winter, he, later, saw, this, as, one, of, the, most, productive, periods, of, his, life, writing, logik, notes, on, logic, the, predecessor, of, much, of, the, tractatus, while, in, norway, wittgenstein, learned, norwegian, to, converse, with, the, local, villagers, and, danish, to, read, the, works, of, the, danish, philosopher, s, ren, kierkegaard, he, adored, the, quiet, seriousness, of, the, landscape, but, even, skjolden, became, too, busy, for, him, he, soon, designed, a, small, wooden, house, which, was, erected, on, a, remote, rock, overlooking, the, eidsvatnet, lake, just, outside, the, village, the, place, was, called, sterrike, austria, by, locals, he, lived, there, during, various, periods, until, the, 1930s, and, substantial, parts, of, his, works, were, written, there, the, house, was, broken, up, in, 1958, to, be, rebuilt, in, the, village, a, local, foundation, collected, donations, and, bought, it, in, 2014, it, was, dismantled, again, and, re, erected, at, its, original, location, the, inauguration, took, place, on, 20, june, 2019, with, international, attendance, it, was, during, this, time, that, wittgenstein, began, addressing, what, he, considered, to, be, a, central, issue, in, notes, on, logic, a, general, decision, procedure, for, determining, the, truth, value, of, logical, propositions, which, would, stem, from, a, single, primitive, proposition, he, became, convinced, during, this, time, that, ll, the, propositions, of, logic, are, generalizations, of, tautologies, and, all, generalizations, of, tautologies, are, generalizations, of, logic, there, are, no, other, logical, propositions, based, on, this, wittgenstein, argued, that, propositions, of, logic, express, their, truth, or, falsehood, in, the, sign, itself, and, one, need, not, know, anything, about, the, constituent, parts, of, the, proposition, to, determine, it, true, or, false, rather, one, simply, need, identify, the, statement, as, a, tautology, true, a, contradiction, false, or, neither, the, problem, lay, in, forming, a, primitive, proposition, which, encompassed, this, and, would, act, as, the, basis, for, all, of, logic, as, he, stated, in, correspondence, with, russell, in, late, 1913, the, big, question, now, is, how, must, a, system, of, signs, be, constituted, in, order, to, make, every, tautology, recognizable, as, such, in, one, and, the, same, way, this, is, the, fundamental, problem, of, logic, the, importance, wittgenstein, placed, upon, this, fundamental, problem, was, so, great, that, he, believed, if, he, did, not, solve, it, he, had, no, reason, or, right, to, live, despite, this, apparent, life, or, death, importance, wittgenstein, had, given, up, on, this, primitive, proposition, by, the, time, of, the, writing, of, the, tractatus, the, tractatus, does, not, offer, any, general, process, for, identifying, propositions, as, tautologies, in, a, simpler, manner, every, tautology, itself, shows, that, it, is, a, tautology, this, shift, to, understanding, tautologies, through, mere, identification, or, recognition, occurred, in, 1914, when, moore, was, called, on, by, wittgenstein, to, assist, him, in, dictating, his, notes, at, wittgenstein, s, insistence, moore, who, was, now, a, cambridge, don, visited, him, in, norway, in, 1914, reluctantly, because, wittgenstein, exhausted, him, david, edmonds, and, john, eidinow, write, that, wittgenstein, regarded, moore, an, internationally, known, philosopher, as, an, example, of, how, far, someone, could, get, in, life, with, absolutely, no, intelligence, whatever, in, norway, it, was, clear, that, moore, was, expected, to, act, as, wittgenstein, s, secretary, taking, down, his, notes, with, wittgenstein, falling, into, a, rage, when, moore, got, something, wrong, when, he, returned, to, cambridge, moore, asked, the, university, to, consider, accepting, logik, as, sufficient, for, a, bachelor, s, degree, but, they, refused, saying, it, wasn, t, formatted, properly, no, footnotes, no, preface, wittgenstein, was, furious, writing, to, moore, in, may, 1914, if, i, am, not, worth, your, making, an, exception, for, me, even, in, some, stupid, details, then, i, may, as, well, go, to, hell, directly, and, if, i, am, worth, it, and, you, don, t, do, it, then, by, god, you, might, go, there, moore, was, apparently, distraught, he, wrote, in, his, diary, that, he, felt, sick, and, could, not, get, the, letter, out, of, his, head, the, two, did, not, speak, again, until, 1929, on, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, wittgenstein, immediately, volunteered, for, the, austro, hungarian, army, despite, being, eligible, for, a, medical, exemption, he, served, first, on, a, ship, and, then, in, an, artillery, workshop, several, miles, from, the, action, he, was, wounded, in, an, accidental, explosion, and, hospitalised, to, krak, w, in, march, 1916, he, was, posted, to, a, fighting, unit, on, the, front, line, of, the, russian, front, as, part, of, the, austrian, 7th, army, where, his, unit, was, involved, in, some, of, the, heaviest, fighting, defending, against, the, brusilov, offensive, wittgenstein, directed, the, fire, of, his, own, artillery, from, an, observation, post, in, no, man, s, land, against, allied, troops, one, of, the, most, dangerous, jobs, since, he, was, targeted, by, enemy, fire, he, was, decorated, with, the, military, merit, medal, with, swords, on, the, ribbon, and, was, commended, by, the, army, for, exceptionally, courageous, behaviour, calmness, sang, froid, and, heroism, that, won, the, total, admiration, of, the, troops, in, january, 1917, he, was, sent, as, a, member, of, a, howitzer, regiment, to, the, russian, front, where, he, won, several, more, medals, for, bravery, including, the, silver, medal, for, valour, first, class, in, 1918, he, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, and, sent, to, the, italian, front, as, part, of, an, artillery, regiment, for, his, part, in, the, final, austrian, offensive, of, june, 1918, he, was, recommended, for, the, gold, medal, for, valour, one, of, the, highest, honours, in, the, austrian, army, but, was, instead, awarded, the, band, of, the, military, service, medal, with, swords, it, being, decided, that, this, particular, action, although, extraordinarily, brave, had, been, insufficiently, consequential, to, merit, the, highest, honour, throughout, the, war, he, kept, notebooks, in, which, he, frequently, wrote, philosophical, reflections, alongside, personal, remarks, including, his, contempt, for, the, character, of, the, other, soldiers, his, notebooks, also, attest, to, his, philosophical, and, spiritual, reflections, and, it, was, during, this, time, that, he, experienced, a, kind, of, religious, awakening, in, his, entry, from, 11, june, 1915, wittgenstein, states, that, the, meaning, of, life, i, e, the, meaning, of, the, world, we, can, call, god, and, connect, with, this, the, comparison, of, god, to, a, father, to, pray, is, to, think, about, the, meaning, of, life, and, on, 8, july, that, to, believe, in, god, means, to, understand, the, meaning, of, life, to, believe, in, god, means, to, see, that, the, facts, of, the, world, are, not, the, end, of, the, matter, to, believe, in, god, means, to, see, that, life, has, a, meaning, when, my, conscience, upsets, my, equilibrium, then, i, am, not, in, agreement, with, something, but, what, is, this, is, it, the, world, certainly, it, is, correct, to, say, conscience, is, the, voice, of, god, he, discovered, leo, tolstoy, s, 1896, the, gospel, in, brief, at, a, bookshop, in, tarn, w, and, carried, it, everywhere, recommending, it, to, anyone, in, distress, to, the, point, where, he, became, known, to, his, fellow, soldiers, as, the, man, with, the, gospels, the, extent, to, which, the, gospel, in, brief, influenced, wittgenstein, can, be, seen, in, the, tractatus, in, the, unique, way, both, books, number, their, sentences, in, 1916, wittgenstein, read, dostoevsky, s, the, brothers, karamazov, so, often, that, he, knew, whole, passages, of, it, by, heart, particularly, the, speeches, of, the, elder, zosima, who, represented, for, him, a, powerful, christian, ideal, a, holy, man, who, could, see, directly, into, the, souls, of, other, people, iain, king, has, suggested, that, wittgenstein, s, writing, changed, substantially, in, 1916, when, he, started, confronting, much, greater, dangers, during, frontline, fighting, russell, said, he, returned, from, the, war, a, changed, man, one, with, a, deeply, mystical, and, ascetic, attitude, in, the, summer, of, 1918, wittgenstein, took, military, leave, and, went, to, stay, in, one, of, his, family, s, vienna, summer, houses, neuwaldegg, it, was, there, in, august, 1918, that, he, completed, the, tractatus, which, he, submitted, with, the, title, der, satz, german, proposition, sentence, phrase, set, but, also, leap, to, the, publishers, jahoda, and, siegel, a, series, of, events, around, this, time, left, him, deeply, upset, on, 13, august, his, uncle, paul, died, on, 25, october, he, learned, that, jahoda, and, siegel, had, decided, not, to, publish, the, tractatus, and, on, 27, october, his, brother, kurt, killed, himself, the, third, of, his, brothers, to, commit, suicide, it, was, around, this, time, he, received, a, letter, from, david, pinsent, s, mother, to, say, that, pinsent, had, been, killed, in, a, plane, crash, on, 8, may, wittgenstein, was, distraught, to, the, point, of, being, suicidal, he, was, sent, back, to, the, italian, front, after, his, leave, and, as, a, result, of, the, defeat, of, the, austrian, army, he, was, captured, by, allied, forces, on, 3, november, in, trentino, he, subsequently, spent, nine, months, in, an, italian, prisoner, of, war, camp, he, returned, to, his, family, in, vienna, on, 25, august, 1919, by, all, accounts, physically, and, mentally, spent, he, apparently, talked, incessantly, about, suicide, terrifying, his, sisters, and, brother, paul, he, decided, to, do, two, things, to, enroll, in, teacher, training, college, as, an, elementary, school, teacher, and, to, get, rid, of, his, fortune, in, 1914, it, had, been, providing, him, with, an, income, of, 300, 000, kronen, a, year, but, by, 1919, was, worth, a, great, deal, more, with, a, sizable, portfolio, of, investments, in, the, united, states, and, the, netherlands, he, divided, it, among, his, siblings, except, for, margarete, insisting, that, it, not, be, held, in, trust, for, him, his, family, saw, him, as, ill, and, acquiesced, in, september, 1919, he, enrolled, in, the, lehrerbildungsanstalt, teacher, training, college, in, the, kundmanngasse, in, vienna, his, sister, hermine, said, that, wittgenstein, working, as, an, elementary, teacher, was, like, using, a, precision, instrument, to, open, crates, but, the, family, decided, not, to, interfere, thomas, bernhard, more, critically, wrote, of, this, period, in, wittgenstein, s, life, the, multi, millionaire, as, a, village, schoolmaster, is, surely, a, piece, of, perversity, in, the, summer, of, 1920, wittgenstein, worked, as, a, gardener, for, a, monastery, at, first, he, applied, under, a, false, name, for, a, teaching, post, at, reichenau, was, awarded, the, job, but, he, declined, it, when, his, identity, was, discovered, as, a, teacher, he, wished, to, no, longer, be, recognized, as, a, member, of, the, wittgenstein, family, in, response, his, brother, paul, wrote, it, is, out, of, the, question, really, completely, out, of, the, question, that, anybody, bearing, our, name, and, whose, elegant, and, gentle, upbringing, can, be, seen, a, thousand, paces, off, would, not, be, identified, as, a, member, of, our, family, that, one, can, neither, simulate, nor, dissimulate, anything, including, a, refined, education, i, need, hardly, tell, you, in, 1920, wittgenstein, was, given, his, first, job, as, a, primary, school, teacher, in, trattenbach, under, his, real, name, in, a, remote, village, of, a, few, hundred, people, his, first, letters, describe, it, as, beautiful, but, in, october, 1921, he, wrote, to, russell, i, am, still, at, trattenbach, surrounded, as, ever, by, odiousness, and, baseness, i, know, that, human, beings, on, the, average, are, not, worth, much, anywhere, but, here, they, are, much, more, good, for, nothing, and, irresponsible, than, elsewhere, he, was, soon, the, object, of, gossip, among, the, villagers, who, found, him, eccentric, at, best, he, did, not, get, on, well, with, the, other, teachers, when, he, found, his, lodgings, too, noisy, he, made, a, bed, for, himself, in, the, school, kitchen, he, was, an, enthusiastic, teacher, offering, late, night, extra, tuition, to, several, of, the, students, something, that, did, not, endear, him, to, the, parents, though, some, of, them, came, to, adore, him, his, sister, hermine, occasionally, watched, him, teach, and, said, the, students, literally, crawled, over, each, other, in, their, desire, to, be, chosen, for, answers, or, demonstrations, to, the, less, able, it, seems, that, he, became, something, of, a, tyrant, the, first, two, hours, of, each, day, were, devoted, to, mathematics, hours, that, monk, writes, some, of, the, pupils, recalled, years, later, with, horror, they, reported, that, he, caned, the, boys, and, boxed, their, ears, and, also, that, he, pulled, the, girls, hair, this, was, not, unusual, at, the, time, for, boys, but, for, the, villagers, he, went, too, far, in, doing, it, to, the, girls, too, girls, were, not, expected, to, understand, algebra, much, less, have, their, ears, boxed, over, it, the, violence, apart, monk, writes, that, he, quickly, became, a, village, legend, shouting, krautsalat, coleslaw, i, e, shredded, cabbage, when, the, headmaster, played, the, piano, and, nonsense, when, a, priest, was, answering, children, s, questions, while, wittgenstein, was, living, in, isolation, in, rural, austria, the, tractatus, was, published, to, considerable, interest, first, in, german, in, 1921, as, logisch, philosophische, abhandlung, part, of, wilhelm, ostwald, s, journal, annalen, der, naturphilosophie, though, wittgenstein, was, not, happy, with, the, result, and, called, it, a, pirate, edition, russell, had, agreed, to, write, an, introduction, to, explain, why, it, was, important, because, it, was, otherwise, unlikely, to, have, been, published, it, was, difficult, if, not, impossible, to, understand, and, wittgenstein, was, unknown, in, philosophy, in, a, letter, to, russell, wittgenstein, wrote, the, main, point, is, the, theory, of, what, can, be, expressed, gesagt, by, prop, s, i, e, by, language, and, which, comes, to, the, same, thing, what, can, be, thought, and, what, can, not, be, expressed, by, pro, s, but, only, shown, gezeigt, which, i, believe, is, the, cardinal, problem, of, philosophy, but, wittgenstein, was, not, happy, with, russell, s, help, he, had, lost, faith, in, russell, finding, him, glib, and, his, philosophy, mechanistic, and, felt, he, had, fundamentally, misunderstood, the, tractatus, the, whole, modern, conception, of, the, world, is, founded, on, the, illusion, that, the, so, called, laws, of, nature, are, the, explanations, of, natural, phenomena, thus, people, today, stop, at, the, laws, of, nature, treating, them, as, something, inviolable, just, as, god, and, fate, were, treated, in, past, ages, and, in, fact, both, were, right, and, both, wrong, though, the, view, of, the, ancients, is, clearer, insofar, as, they, have, an, acknowledged, terminus, while, the, modern, system, tries, to, make, it, look, as, if, everything, were, explained, an, english, translation, was, prepared, in, cambridge, by, frank, ramsey, a, mathematics, undergraduate, at, king, s, commissioned, by, c, k, ogden, it, was, moore, who, suggested, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, for, the, title, an, allusion, to, baruch, spinoza, s, tractatus, theologico, politicus, initially, there, were, difficulties, in, finding, a, publisher, for, the, english, edition, too, because, wittgenstein, was, insisting, it, appear, without, russell, s, introduction, cambridge, university, press, turned, it, down, for, that, reason, finally, in, 1922, an, agreement, was, reached, with, wittgenstein, that, kegan, paul, would, print, a, bilingual, edition, with, russell, s, introduction, and, the, ramsey, ogden, translation, this, is, the, translation, that, was, approved, by, wittgenstein, but, it, is, problematic, in, a, number, of, ways, wittgenstein, s, english, was, poor, at, the, time, and, ramsey, was, a, teenager, who, had, only, recently, learned, german, so, philosophers, often, prefer, to, use, a, 1961, translation, by, david, pears, and, brian, mcguinness, an, aim, of, the, tractatus, is, to, reveal, the, relationship, between, language, and, the, world, what, can, be, said, about, it, and, what, can, only, be, shown, wittgenstein, argues, that, the, logical, structure, of, language, provides, the, limits, of, meaning, the, limits, of, language, for, wittgenstein, are, the, limits, of, philosophy, much, of, philosophy, involves, attempts, to, say, the, unsayable, what, we, can, say, at, all, can, be, said, clearly, he, argues, anything, beyond, that, religion, ethics, aesthetics, the, mystical, cannot, be, discussed, they, are, not, in, themselves, nonsensical, but, any, statement, about, them, must, be, he, wrote, in, the, preface, the, book, will, therefore, draw, a, limit, to, thinking, or, rather, not, to, thinking, but, to, the, expression, of, thoughts, for, in, order, to, draw, a, limit, to, thinking, we, should, have, to, be, able, to, think, both, sides, of, this, limit, we, should, therefore, have, to, be, able, to, think, what, cannot, be, thought, the, book, is, 75, pages, long, as, to, the, shortness, of, the, book, i, am, awfully, sorry, for, it, if, you, were, to, squeeze, me, like, a, lemon, you, would, get, nothing, more, out, of, me, he, told, ogden, and, presents, seven, numbered, propositions, 1, 7, with, various, sub, levels, 1, 1, 1, 1, 11, in, september, 1922, he, moved, to, a, secondary, school, in, a, nearby, village, hassbach, but, considered, the, people, there, just, as, bad, these, people, are, not, human, at, all, but, loathsome, worms, he, wrote, to, a, friend, and, he, left, after, a, month, in, november, he, began, work, at, another, primary, school, this, time, in, puchberg, in, the, schneeberg, mountains, there, he, told, russell, the, villagers, were, one, quarter, animal, and, three, quarters, human, frank, p, ramsey, visited, him, on, 17, september, 1923, to, discuss, the, tractatus, he, had, agreed, to, write, a, review, of, it, for, mind, he, reported, in, a, letter, home, that, wittgenstein, was, living, frugally, in, one, tiny, whitewashed, room, that, only, had, space, for, a, bed, a, washstand, a, small, table, and, one, small, hard, chair, ramsey, shared, an, evening, meal, with, him, of, coarse, bread, butter, and, cocoa, wittgenstein, s, school, hours, were, eight, to, twelve, or, one, and, he, had, afternoons, free, after, ramsey, returned, to, cambridge, a, long, campaign, began, among, wittgenstein, s, friends, to, persuade, him, to, return, to, cambridge, and, away, from, what, they, saw, as, a, hostile, environment, for, him, he, was, accepting, no, help, even, from, his, family, ramsey, wrote, to, john, maynard, keynes, are, very, rich, and, extremely, anxious, to, give, him, money, or, do, anything, for, him, in, any, way, and, he, rejects, all, their, advances, even, christmas, presents, or, presents, of, invalid, s, food, when, he, is, ill, he, sends, back, and, this, is, not, because, they, aren, t, on, good, terms, but, because, he, won, t, have, any, money, he, hasn, t, earned, it, is, an, awful, pity, he, moved, schools, again, in, september, 1924, this, time, to, otterthal, near, trattenbach, the, socialist, headmaster, josef, putre, was, someone, wittgenstein, had, become, friends, with, while, at, trattenbach, while, he, was, there, he, wrote, a, 42, page, pronunciation, and, spelling, dictionary, for, the, children, w, rterbuch, f, r, volksschulen, published, in, vienna, in, 1926, by, h, lder, pichler, tempsky, the, only, book, of, his, apart, from, the, tractatus, that, was, published, in, his, lifetime, a, first, edition, sold, in, 2005, for, 75, 000, in, 2020, an, english, version, entitled, word, book, translated, by, art, historian, bettina, funcke, and, illustrated, by, artist, publisher, paul, chan, was, released, the, w, rterbuch, f, r, volksschulen, is, remarkable, for, its, pluricentric, conceptualization, decades, before, such, linguistic, approach, existed, in, wittgenstein, s, preface, to, the, w, rterbuch, which, was, withheld, at, the, publisher, s, request, but, which, survives, in, a, 1925, typescript, wittgenstein, takes, a, clear, stance, for, a, standard, austrian, german, which, he, aimed, to, document, for, elementary, pupils, in, the, text, wittgenstein, states, translated, from, the, german, that, the, dictionary, should, include, only, words, but, all, such, words, that, are, known, to, austrian, elementary, students, therefore, it, excludes, many, a, good, german, word, unusual, in, austria, wittgenstein, is, through, his, school, dictionary, one, of, the, earliest, proponents, of, a, german, with, more, than, one, standard, variety, this, is, especially, noteworthy, in, the, german, language, context, in, which, expert, debates, over, the, status, and, relevance, of, standard, varieties, are, so, common, that, some, speak, of, a, one, standard, german, axiom, in, that, field, today, wittgenstein, was, taking, a, stance, for, multiple, standards, against, such, an, axiom, long, before, these, debates, ensued, an, incident, occurred, in, april, 1926, and, became, known, as, der, vorfall, haidbauer, the, haidbauer, incident, josef, haidbauer, was, an, 11, year, old, pupil, whose, father, had, died, and, whose, mother, worked, as, a, local, maid, he, was, a, slow, learner, and, one, day, wittgenstein, hit, him, two, or, three, times, on, the, head, causing, him, to, collapse, wittgenstein, carried, him, to, the, headmaster, s, office, then, quickly, left, the, school, bumping, into, a, parent, herr, piribauer, on, the, way, out, piribauer, had, been, sent, for, by, the, children, when, they, saw, haidbauer, collapse, wittgenstein, had, previously, pulled, piribauer, s, daughter, hermine, so, hard, by, the, ears, that, her, ears, had, bled, piribauer, said, that, when, he, met, wittgenstein, in, the, hall, that, day, i, called, him, all, the, names, under, the, sun, i, told, him, he, wasn, t, a, teacher, he, was, an, animal, trainer, and, that, i, was, going, to, fetch, the, police, right, away, piribauer, tried, to, have, wittgenstein, arrested, but, the, village, s, police, station, was, empty, and, when, he, tried, again, the, next, day, he, was, told, wittgenstein, had, disappeared, on, 28, april, 1926, wittgenstein, handed, in, his, resignation, to, wilhelm, kundt, a, local, school, inspector, who, tried, to, persuade, him, to, stay, however, wittgenstein, was, adamant, that, his, days, as, a, schoolteacher, were, over, proceedings, were, initiated, in, may, and, the, judge, ordered, a, psychiatric, report, in, august, 1926, a, letter, to, wittgenstein, from, a, friend, ludwig, h, nsel, indicates, that, hearings, were, ongoing, but, nothing, is, known, about, the, case, after, that, alexander, waugh, writes, that, wittgenstein, s, family, and, their, money, may, have, had, a, hand, in, covering, things, up, waugh, writes, that, haidbauer, died, shortly, afterwards, of, haemophilia, monk, says, he, died, when, he, was, 14, of, leukaemia, ten, years, later, in, 1936, as, part, of, a, series, of, confessions, he, engaged, in, that, year, wittgenstein, appeared, without, warning, at, the, village, saying, he, wanted, to, confess, personally, and, ask, for, pardon, from, the, children, he, had, hit, he, visited, at, least, four, of, the, children, including, hermine, piribauer, who, apparently, replied, only, with, a, ja, ja, though, other, former, students, were, more, hospitable, monk, writes, that, the, purpose, of, these, confessions, was, not, to, hurt, his, pride, as, a, form, of, punishment, it, was, to, dismantle, it, to, remove, a, barrier, as, it, were, that, stood, in, the, way, of, honest, and, decent, thought, of, the, apologies, wittgenstein, wrote, this, brought, me, into, more, settled, waters, and, to, greater, seriousness, the, tractatus, was, now, the, subject, of, much, debate, amongst, philosophers, and, wittgenstein, was, a, figure, of, increasing, international, fame, in, particular, a, discussion, group, of, philosophers, scientists, and, mathematicians, known, as, the, vienna, circle, had, developed, purportedly, as, a, result, of, the, inspiration, they, had, been, given, by, reading, the, tractatus, while, it, is, commonly, assumed, that, wittgenstein, was, a, part, of, the, vienna, circle, in, reality, this, was, not, the, case, german, philosopher, oswald, hanfling, writes, bluntly, wittgenstein, was, never, a, member, of, the, circle, though, he, was, in, vienna, during, much, of, the, time, yet, his, influence, on, the, circle, s, thought, was, at, least, as, important, as, that, of, any, of, its, members, philosopher, a, c, grayling, however, contends, that, while, certain, superficial, similarities, between, wittgenstein, s, early, philosophy, and, logical, positivism, led, its, members, to, study, the, tractatus, in, detail, and, to, arrange, discussions, with, him, wittgenstein, s, influence, on, the, circle, was, rather, limited, the, fundamental, philosophical, views, of, circle, had, been, established, before, they, met, wittgenstein, and, had, their, origins, in, the, british, empiricists, ernst, mach, and, the, logic, of, frege, and, russell, whatever, influence, wittgenstein, did, have, on, the, circle, was, largely, limited, to, moritz, schlick, and, friedrich, waismann, and, even, in, these, cases, had, little, lasting, effect, on, their, positivism, grayling, states, that, it, is, no, longer, possible, to, think, of, the, tractatus, as, having, inspired, a, philosophical, movement, as, most, earlier, commentators, claimed, from, 1926, wittgenstein, took, part, in, many, discussions, with, the, members, of, the, vienna, circle, during, these, discussions, it, soon, became, evident, that, wittgenstein, held, a, different, attitude, towards, philosophy, from, the, members, of, the, circle, for, example, during, meetings, of, the, vienna, circle, he, would, express, his, disagreement, with, the, group, s, misreading, of, his, work, by, turning, his, back, to, them, and, reading, poetry, aloud, in, his, autobiography, rudolf, carnap, describes, wittgenstein, as, the, thinker, who, most, inspired, him, however, he, also, wrote, that, there, was, a, striking, difference, between, wittgenstein, s, attitude, toward, philosophical, problems, and, that, of, schlick, and, myself, our, attitude, toward, philosophical, problems, was, not, very, different, from, that, which, scientists, have, toward, their, problems, as, for, wittgenstein, his, point, of, view, and, his, attitude, toward, people, and, problems, even, theoretical, problems, were, much, more, similar, to, those, of, a, creative, artist, than, to, those, of, a, scientist, one, might, almost, say, similar, to, those, of, a, religious, prophet, or, a, seer, when, finally, sometimes, after, a, prolonged, arduous, effort, his, answers, came, forth, his, statement, stood, before, us, like, a, newly, created, piece, of, art, or, a, divine, revelation, the, impression, he, made, on, us, was, as, if, insight, came, to, him, as, through, divine, inspiration, so, that, we, could, not, help, feeling, that, any, sober, rational, comment, or, analysis, of, it, would, be, a, profanation, i, am, not, interested, in, erecting, a, building, but, in, presenting, to, myself, the, foundations, of, all, possible, buildings, in, 1926, wittgenstein, was, again, working, as, a, gardener, for, a, number, of, months, this, time, at, the, monastery, of, h, tteldorf, where, he, had, also, inquired, about, becoming, a, monk, his, sister, margaret, invited, him, to, help, with, the, design, of, her, new, townhouse, in, vienna, s, kundmanngasse, wittgenstein, his, friend, paul, engelmann, and, a, team, of, architects, developed, a, spare, modernist, house, in, particular, wittgenstein, focused, on, the, windows, doors, and, radiators, demanding, that, every, detail, be, exactly, as, he, specified, when, the, house, was, nearly, finished, wittgenstein, had, an, entire, ceiling, raised, 30, mm, so, that, the, room, had, the, exact, proportions, he, wanted, monk, writes, that, this, is, not, so, marginal, as, it, may, at, first, appear, for, it, is, precisely, these, details, that, lend, what, is, otherwise, a, rather, plain, even, ugly, house, its, distinctive, beauty, it, took, him, a, year, to, design, the, door, handles, and, another, to, design, the, radiators, each, window, was, covered, by, a, metal, screen, that, weighed, 150, kilograms, 330, lb, moved, by, a, pulley, wittgenstein, designed, bernhard, leitner, author, of, the, architecture, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, said, there, is, barely, anything, comparable, in, the, history, of, interior, design, it, is, as, ingenious, as, it, is, expensive, a, metal, curtain, that, could, be, lowered, into, the, floor, the, house, was, finished, by, december, 1928, and, the, family, gathered, there, at, christmas, to, celebrate, its, completion, wittgenstein, s, sister, hermine, wrote, even, though, i, admired, the, house, very, much, it, seemed, indeed, to, be, much, more, a, dwelling, for, the, gods, wittgenstein, said, the, house, i, built, for, gretl, is, the, product, of, a, decidedly, sensitive, ear, and, good, manners, and, expression, of, great, understanding, but, primordial, life, wild, life, striving, to, erupt, into, the, open, that, is, lacking, monk, comments, that, the, same, might, be, said, of, the, technically, excellent, but, austere, terracotta, sculpture, wittgenstein, had, modelled, of, marguerite, respinger, in, 1926, and, that, as, russell, first, noticed, this, wild, life, striving, to, be, in, the, open, was, precisely, the, substance, of, wittgenstein, s, philosophical, work, according, to, feigl, as, reported, by, monk, upon, attending, a, conference, in, vienna, by, mathematician, l, e, j, brouwer, wittgenstein, remained, quite, impressed, taking, into, consideration, the, possibility, of, a, return, to, philosophy, at, the, urging, of, ramsey, and, others, wittgenstein, returned, to, cambridge, in, 1929, keynes, wrote, in, a, letter, to, his, wife, well, god, has, arrived, i, met, him, on, the, 5, 15, train, despite, this, fame, he, could, not, initially, work, at, cambridge, as, he, did, not, have, a, degree, so, he, applied, as, an, advanced, undergraduate, russell, noted, that, his, previous, residency, was, sufficient, to, fulfill, eligibility, requirements, for, a, phd, and, urged, him, to, offer, the, tractatus, as, his, thesis, it, was, examined, in, 1929, by, russell, and, moore, at, the, end, of, the, thesis, defence, wittgenstein, clapped, the, two, examiners, on, the, shoulder, and, said, don, t, worry, i, know, you, ll, never, understand, it, moore, wrote, in, the, examiner, s, report, i, myself, consider, that, this, is, a, work, of, genius, but, even, if, i, am, completely, mistaken, and, it, is, nothing, of, the, sort, it, is, well, above, the, standard, required, for, the, ph, d, degree, wittgenstein, was, appointed, as, a, lecturer, and, was, made, a, fellow, of, trinity, college, from, 1936, to, 1937, wittgenstein, lived, again, in, norway, where, he, worked, on, the, philosophical, investigations, in, the, winter, of, 1936, 7, he, delivered, a, series, of, confessions, to, close, friends, most, of, them, about, minor, infractions, like, white, lies, in, an, effort, to, cleanse, himself, in, 1938, he, travelled, to, ireland, to, visit, maurice, o, connor, drury, a, friend, who, became, a, psychiatrist, and, considered, such, training, himself, with, the, intention, of, abandoning, philosophy, for, it, the, visit, to, ireland, was, at, the, same, time, a, response, to, the, invitation, of, the, then, irish, taoiseach, amon, de, valera, himself, a, former, mathematics, teacher, de, valera, hoped, wittgenstein, s, presence, would, contribute, to, the, dublin, institute, for, advanced, studies, which, he, was, soon, to, set, up, while, he, was, in, ireland, in, march, 1938, germany, annexed, austria, in, the, anschluss, the, viennese, wittgenstein, was, now, a, jew, under, the, 1935, nuremberg, racial, laws, because, three, of, his, grandparents, had, been, born, as, jews, he, would, also, in, july, become, by, law, a, citizen, of, the, enlarged, germany, the, nuremberg, laws, classified, people, as, jews, volljuden, if, they, had, three, or, four, jewish, grandparents, and, as, mixed, blood, mischling, if, they, had, one, or, two, it, meant, among, other, things, that, the, wittgensteins, were, restricted, in, whom, they, could, marry, or, have, sex, with, and, where, they, could, work, after, the, anschluss, his, brother, paul, left, almost, immediately, for, england, and, later, the, us, the, nazis, discovered, his, relationship, with, hilde, schania, a, brewer, s, daughter, with, whom, he, had, had, two, children, but, whom, he, had, never, married, though, he, did, later, because, she, was, not, jewish, he, was, served, with, a, summons, for, rassenschande, racial, defilement, he, told, no, one, he, was, leaving, the, country, except, for, hilde, who, agreed, to, follow, him, he, left, so, suddenly, and, quietly, that, for, a, time, people, believed, he, was, the, fourth, wittgenstein, brother, to, have, committed, suicide, wittgenstein, began, to, investigate, acquiring, british, or, irish, citizenship, with, the, help, of, keynes, and, apparently, had, to, confess, to, his, friends, in, england, that, he, had, earlier, misrepresented, himself, to, them, as, having, just, one, jewish, grandparent, when, in, fact, he, had, three, a, few, days, before, the, invasion, of, poland, hitler, personally, granted, mischling, status, to, the, wittgenstein, siblings, in, 1939, there, were, 2, 100, applications, for, this, and, hitler, granted, only, 12, anthony, gottlieb, writes, that, the, pretext, was, that, their, paternal, grandfather, had, been, the, bastard, son, of, a, german, prince, which, allowed, the, reichsbank, to, claim, foreign, currency, stocks, and, 1700, kg, of, gold, held, in, switzerland, by, a, wittgenstein, family, trust, gretl, an, american, citizen, by, marriage, started, the, negotiations, over, the, racial, status, of, their, grandfather, and, the, family, s, large, foreign, currency, reserves, were, used, as, a, bargaining, tool, paul, had, escaped, to, switzerland, and, then, the, us, in, july, 1938, and, disagreed, with, the, negotiations, leading, to, a, permanent, split, between, the, siblings, after, the, war, when, paul, was, performing, in, vienna, he, did, not, visit, hermine, who, was, dying, there, and, he, had, no, further, contact, with, ludwig, or, gretl, after, g, e, moore, resigned, the, chair, in, philosophy, in, 1939, wittgenstein, was, elected, he, was, naturalised, as, a, british, subject, shortly, after, on, 12, april, 1939, in, july, 1939, he, travelled, to, vienna, to, assist, gretl, and, his, other, sisters, visiting, berlin, for, one, day, to, meet, an, official, of, the, reichsbank, after, this, he, travelled, to, new, york, to, persuade, paul, whose, agreement, was, required, to, back, the, scheme, the, required, befreiung, was, granted, in, august, 1939, the, unknown, amount, signed, over, to, the, nazis, by, the, wittgenstein, family, a, week, or, so, before, the, outbreak, of, war, included, amongst, many, other, assets, 1, 700, kg, of, gold, there, is, a, report, wittgenstein, visited, moscow, a, second, time, in, 1939, travelling, from, berlin, and, again, met, the, philosopher, sophia, janowskaya, norman, malcolm, at, the, time, a, post, graduate, research, fellow, at, cambridge, describes, his, first, impressions, of, wittgenstein, in, 1938, at, a, meeting, of, the, moral, science, club, after, the, paper, for, the, evening, was, read, and, the, discussion, started, someone, began, to, stammer, a, remark, he, had, extreme, difficulty, in, expressing, himself, and, his, words, were, unintelligible, to, me, i, whispered, to, my, neighbour, who, s, that, he, replied, wittgenstein, i, was, astonished, because, i, had, expected, the, famous, author, of, the, tractatus, to, be, an, elderly, man, whereas, this, man, looked, young, perhaps, about, 35, his, actual, age, was, 49, his, face, was, lean, and, brown, his, profile, was, aquiline, and, strikingly, beautiful, his, head, was, covered, with, a, curly, mass, of, brown, hair, i, observed, the, respectful, attention, that, everyone, in, the, room, paid, to, him, after, this, unsuccessful, beginning, he, did, not, speak, for, a, time, but, was, obviously, struggling, with, his, thoughts, his, look, was, concentrated, he, made, striking, gestures, with, his, hands, as, if, he, was, discoursing, whether, lecturing, or, conversing, privately, wittgenstein, always, spoke, emphatically, and, with, a, distinctive, intonation, he, spoke, excellent, english, with, the, accent, of, an, educated, englishman, although, occasional, germanisms, would, appear, in, his, constructions, his, voice, was, resonant, his, words, came, out, not, fluently, but, with, great, force, anyone, who, heard, him, say, anything, knew, that, this, was, a, singular, person, his, face, was, remarkably, mobile, and, expressive, when, he, talked, his, eyes, were, deep, and, often, fierce, in, their, expression, his, whole, personality, was, commanding, even, imperial, describing, wittgenstein, s, lecture, programme, malcolm, continues, it, is, hardly, correct, to, speak, of, these, meetings, as, lectures, although, this, is, what, wittgenstein, called, them, for, one, thing, he, was, carrying, on, original, research, in, these, meetings, often, the, meetings, consisted, mainly, of, dialogue, sometimes, however, when, he, was, trying, to, draw, a, thought, out, of, himself, he, would, prohibit, with, a, peremptory, motion, of, the, hand, any, questions, or, remarks, there, were, frequent, and, prolonged, periods, of, silence, with, only, an, occasional, mutter, from, wittgenstein, and, the, stillest, attention, from, the, others, during, these, silences, wittgenstein, was, extremely, tense, and, active, his, gaze, was, concentrated, his, face, was, alive, his, hands, made, arresting, movements, his, expression, was, stern, one, knew, that, one, was, in, the, presence, of, extreme, seriousness, absorption, and, force, of, intellect, wittgenstein, was, a, frightening, person, at, these, classes, after, work, the, philosopher, would, often, relax, by, watching, westerns, where, he, preferred, to, sit, at, the, very, front, of, the, cinema, or, reading, detective, stories, especially, the, ones, written, by, norbert, davis, norman, malcolm, wrote, that, wittgenstein, would, rush, to, the, cinema, when, class, ended, by, this, time, wittgenstein, s, view, on, the, foundations, of, mathematics, had, changed, considerably, in, his, early, 20s, wittgenstein, had, thought, logic, could, provide, a, solid, foundation, and, he, had, even, considered, updating, russell, and, whitehead, s, principia, mathematica, now, he, denied, there, were, any, mathematical, facts, to, be, discovered, he, gave, a, series, of, lectures, on, mathematics, discussing, this, and, other, topics, documented, in, a, book, with, lectures, by, wittgenstein, and, discussions, between, him, and, several, students, including, the, young, alan, turing, who, described, wittgenstein, as, a, very, peculiar, man, the, two, had, many, discussions, about, the, relationship, between, computational, logic, and, everyday, notions, of, truth, wittgenstein, s, lectures, from, this, period, have, also, been, discussed, by, another, of, his, students, the, greek, philosopher, and, educator, helle, lambridis, wittgenstein, s, teachings, in, the, years, 1940, 1941, are, used, in, the, mid, 1950s, by, lambridis, to, write, a, long, text, in, the, form, of, an, imagined, dialogue, with, him, where, she, begins, to, develop, her, own, ideas, about, resemblance, in, relation, to, language, elementary, concepts, and, basic, level, mental, images, initially, only, a, part, of, it, was, published, in, 1963, in, the, german, education, theory, review, club, voltaire, but, the, entire, imagined, dialogue, with, wittgenstein, was, published, after, lambridis, s, death, by, her, archive, holder, the, academy, of, athens, in, 2004, monk, writes, that, wittgenstein, found, it, intolerable, that, a, war, world, war, ii, was, going, on, and, he, was, teaching, philosophy, he, grew, angry, when, any, of, his, students, wanted, to, become, professional, philosophers, in, september, 1941, he, asked, john, ryle, the, brother, of, the, philosopher, gilbert, ryle, if, he, could, get, a, manual, job, at, guy, s, hospital, in, london, john, ryle, was, professor, of, medicine, at, cambridge, and, had, been, involved, in, helping, guy, s, prepare, for, the, blitz, wittgenstein, told, ryle, he, would, die, slowly, if, left, at, cambridge, and, he, would, rather, die, quickly, he, started, working, at, guy, s, shortly, afterwards, as, a, dispensary, porter, delivering, drugs, from, the, pharmacy, to, the, wards, where, he, apparently, advised, the, patients, not, to, take, them, in, the, new, year, of, 1942, ryle, took, wittgenstein, to, his, home, in, sussex, to, meet, his, wife, who, had, been, determined, to, meet, him, his, son, recorded, the, weekend, in, his, diary, wink, is, awful, strange, not, a, very, good, english, speaker, keeps, on, saying, i, mean, and, its, tolerable, meaning, intolerable, the, hospital, staff, were, not, told, he, was, one, of, the, world, s, most, famous, philosophers, though, some, of, the, medical, staff, did, recognize, him, at, least, one, had, attended, moral, sciences, club, meetings, but, they, were, discreet, good, god, don, t, tell, anybody, who, i, am, wittgenstein, begged, one, of, them, some, of, them, nevertheless, called, him, professor, wittgenstein, and, he, was, allowed, to, dine, with, the, doctors, he, wrote, on, 1, april, 1942, i, no, longer, feel, any, hope, for, the, future, of, my, life, it, is, as, though, i, had, before, me, nothing, more, than, a, long, stretch, of, living, death, i, cannot, imagine, any, future, for, me, other, than, a, ghastly, one, friendless, and, joyless, it, was, at, this, time, that, wittgenstein, had, an, operation, at, guy, s, to, remove, a, gallstone, that, had, troubled, him, for, some, years, he, had, developed, a, friendship, with, keith, kirk, a, working, class, teenage, friend, of, francis, skinner, the, mathematics, undergraduate, he, had, had, a, relationship, with, until, skinner, s, death, in, 1941, from, polio, skinner, had, given, up, academia, thanks, at, least, in, part, to, wittgenstein, s, influence, and, had, been, working, as, a, mechanic, in, 1939, with, kirk, as, his, apprentice, kirk, and, wittgenstein, struck, up, a, friendship, with, wittgenstein, giving, him, lessons, in, physics, to, help, him, pass, a, city, and, guilds, exam, during, his, period, of, loneliness, at, guy, s, he, wrote, in, his, diary, for, ten, days, i, ve, heard, nothing, more, from, k, even, though, i, pressed, him, a, week, ago, for, news, i, think, that, he, has, perhaps, broken, with, me, a, tragic, thought, kirk, had, in, fact, got, married, and, they, never, saw, one, another, again, while, wittgenstein, was, at, guy, s, he, met, basil, reeve, a, young, doctor, with, an, interest, in, philosophy, who, with, r, t, grant, was, studying, the, effect, of, wound, shock, a, state, associative, to, hypovolaemia, on, air, raid, casualties, when, the, blitz, ended, there, were, fewer, casualties, to, study, in, november, 1942, grant, and, reeve, moved, to, the, royal, victoria, infirmary, newcastle, upon, tyne, to, study, road, traffic, and, industrial, casualties, grant, offered, wittgenstein, a, position, as, a, laboratory, assistant, at, a, wage, of, 4, per, week, and, he, lived, in, newcastle, at, 28, brandling, park, jesmond, from, 29, april, 1943, until, february, 1944, while, there, he, worked, and, associated, socially, with, dr, erasmus, barlow, a, great, grandson, of, charles, darwin, in, the, summer, of, 1946, wittgenstein, thought, often, of, leaving, cambridge, and, resigning, his, position, as, chair, wittgenstein, grew, further, dismayed, at, the, state, of, philosophy, particularly, about, articles, published, in, the, journal, mind, it, was, around, this, time, that, wittgenstein, fell, in, love, with, ben, richards, who, was, a, medical, student, writing, in, his, diary, the, only, thing, that, my, love, for, b, has, done, for, me, is, this, it, has, driven, the, other, small, worries, associated, with, my, position, and, my, work, into, the, background, on, 30, september, wittgenstein, wrote, about, cambridge, after, his, return, from, swansea, everything, about, the, place, repels, me, the, stiffness, the, artificiality, the, self, satisfaction, of, the, people, the, university, atmosphere, nauseates, me, wittgenstein, had, only, maintained, contact, with, fouracre, from, guy, s, hospital, who, had, joined, the, army, in, 1943, after, his, marriage, only, returning, in, 1947, wittgenstein, maintained, frequent, correspondence, with, fouracre, during, his, time, away, displaying, a, desire, for, fouracre, to, return, home, urgently, from, the, war, in, may, 1947, wittgenstein, addressed, a, group, of, oxford, philosophers, for, the, first, time, at, the, jowett, society, the, discussion, was, on, the, validity, of, descartes, cogito, ergo, sum, where, wittgenstein, ignored, the, question, and, applied, his, own, philosophical, method, harold, arthur, prichard, who, attended, the, event, was, not, pleased, with, wittgenstein, s, methods, wittgenstein, if, a, man, says, to, me, looking, at, the, sky, i, think, it, will, rain, therefore, i, exist, i, do, not, understand, him, prichard, that, s, all, very, fine, what, we, want, to, know, is, is, the, cogito, valid, or, not, death, is, not, an, event, in, life, we, do, not, live, to, experience, death, if, we, take, eternity, to, mean, not, infinite, temporal, duration, but, timelessness, then, eternal, life, belongs, to, those, who, live, in, the, present, our, life, has, no, end, in, the, way, in, which, our, visual, field, has, no, limits, wittgenstein, resigned, the, professorship, at, cambridge, in, 1947, to, concentrate, on, his, writing, and, in, 1947, and, 1948, travelled, to, ireland, staying, at, ross, s, hotel, in, dublin, and, at, a, farmhouse, in, redcross, county, wicklow, where, he, began, the, manuscript, ms, 137, volume, r, seeking, solitude, he, moved, to, a, holiday, cottage, in, rosroe, overlooking, killary, harbour, connemara, owned, by, drury, s, brother, he, also, accepted, an, invitation, from, norman, malcolm, then, professor, at, cornell, university, to, stay, with, him, and, his, wife, for, several, months, at, ithaca, new, york, he, made, the, trip, in, april, 1949, although, he, told, malcolm, he, was, too, unwell, to, do, philosophical, work, i, haven, t, done, any, work, since, the, beginning, of, march, i, haven, t, had, the, strength, of, even, trying, to, do, any, a, doctor, in, dublin, had, diagnosed, anaemia, and, prescribed, iron, and, liver, pills, the, details, of, wittgenstein, s, stay, in, the, us, are, recounted, in, norman, malcolm, s, ludwig, wittgenstein, a, memoir, during, his, summer, in, the, us, wittgenstein, began, his, epistemological, discussions, in, particular, his, engagement, with, philosophical, scepticism, that, would, eventually, become, the, final, fragments, on, certainty, he, returned, to, london, where, he, was, diagnosed, with, an, inoperable, prostate, cancer, which, had, spread, to, his, bone, marrow, he, spent, the, next, two, months, in, vienna, where, his, sister, hermine, died, on, 11, february, 1950, he, went, to, see, her, every, day, but, she, was, hardly, able, to, speak, or, recognize, him, great, loss, for, me, and, all, of, us, he, wrote, greater, than, i, would, have, thought, he, moved, frequently, after, hermine, s, death, staying, with, various, friends, to, cambridge, in, april, 1950, where, he, stayed, with, g, h, von, wright, to, london, to, stay, with, rush, rhees, then, to, oxford, to, see, elizabeth, anscombe, writing, to, norman, malcolm, that, he, was, doing, hardly, any, philosophy, he, went, to, norway, in, august, with, ben, richards, then, returned, to, cambridge, where, on, 27, november, he, moved, into, storey, s, end, at, 76, storey, s, way, the, home, of, his, doctor, edward, bevan, and, his, wife, joan, he, had, told, them, he, did, not, want, to, die, in, a, hospital, so, they, said, he, could, spend, his, last, days, in, their, home, instead, joan, at, first, was, afraid, of, wittgenstein, but, they, soon, became, good, friends, by, the, beginning, of, 1951, it, was, clear, that, he, had, little, time, left, he, wrote, a, new, will, in, oxford, on, 29, january, naming, rhees, as, his, executor, and, anscombe, and, von, wright, his, literary, administrators, and, wrote, to, norman, malcolm, that, month, to, say, my, mind, s, completely, dead, this, isn, t, a, complaint, for, i, don, t, really, suffer, from, it, i, know, that, life, must, have, an, end, once, and, that, mental, life, can, cease, before, the, rest, does, in, february, he, returned, to, the, bevans, home, to, work, on, ms, 175, and, ms, 176, these, and, other, manuscripts, were, later, published, as, remarks, on, colour, and, on, certainty, he, wrote, to, malcolm, on, 16, april, 13, days, before, his, death, an, extraordinary, thing, happened, to, me, about, a, month, ago, i, suddenly, found, myself, in, the, right, frame, of, mind, for, doing, philosophy, i, had, been, absolutely, certain, that, i, d, never, again, be, able, to, do, it, it, s, the, first, time, after, more, than, 2, years, that, the, curtain, in, my, brain, has, gone, up, of, course, so, far, i, ve, only, worked, for, about, 5, weeks, it, may, be, all, over, by, tomorrow, but, it, bucks, me, up, a, lot, now, wittgenstein, began, work, on, his, final, manuscript, ms, 177, on, 25, april, 1951, it, was, his, 62nd, birthday, on, 26, april, he, went, for, a, walk, the, next, afternoon, and, wrote, his, last, entry, that, day, 27, april, that, evening, he, became, very, ill, when, his, doctor, told, him, he, might, live, only, a, few, days, he, reportedly, replied, good, joan, stayed, with, him, throughout, that, night, and, just, before, losing, consciousness, for, the, last, time, on, 28, april, he, told, her, tell, them, i, ve, had, a, wonderful, life, norman, malcolm, describes, this, as, a, strangely, moving, utterance, four, of, wittgenstein, s, former, students, arrived, at, his, bedside, ben, richards, elizabeth, anscombe, yorick, smythies, and, maurice, o, connor, drury, anscombe, and, smythies, were, catholics, and, at, the, latter, s, request, a, dominican, friar, father, conrad, pepler, also, attended, wittgenstein, had, asked, for, a, priest, who, was, not, a, philosopher, and, had, met, with, pepler, several, times, before, his, death, they, were, at, first, unsure, what, wittgenstein, would, have, wanted, but, then, remembered, he, had, said, he, hoped, his, catholic, friends, would, pray, for, him, so, they, did, and, he, was, pronounced, dead, shortly, afterwards, wittgenstein, was, given, a, catholic, burial, at, ascension, parish, burial, ground, in, cambridge, drury, later, said, he, had, been, troubled, ever, since, about, whether, that, was, the, right, thing, to, do, in, 2015, the, ledger, gravestone, was, refurbished, by, the, british, wittgenstein, society, on, his, religious, views, wittgenstein, was, said, to, be, greatly, interested, in, catholicism, and, was, sympathetic, to, it, but, did, not, consider, himself, to, be, a, catholic, according, to, norman, malcolm, wittgenstein, saw, catholicism, more, as, a, way, of, life, than, as, a, set, of, beliefs, he, held, considering, that, he, did, not, accept, any, religious, faith, wittgenstein, has, no, goal, to, either, support, or, reject, religion, his, only, interest, is, to, keep, discussions, whether, religious, or, not, clear, t, labron, 2006, wittgenstein, was, said, by, some, commentators, to, be, agnostic, in, a, qualified, sense, i, won, t, say, see, you, tomorrow, because, that, would, be, like, predicting, the, future, and, i, m, pretty, sure, i, can, t, do, that, the, blue, book, a, set, of, notes, dictated, to, his, class, at, cambridge, in, 1933, 1934, contains, the, seeds, of, wittgenstein, s, later, thoughts, on, language, and, is, widely, read, as, a, turning, point, in, his, philosophy, of, language, philosophical, investigations, was, published, in, two, parts, in, 1953, most, of, part, i, was, ready, for, printing, in, 1946, but, wittgenstein, withdrew, the, manuscript, from, his, publisher, the, shorter, part, ii, was, added, by, his, editors, elizabeth, anscombe, and, rush, rhees, wittgenstein, asks, the, reader, to, think, of, language, as, a, multiplicity, of, language, games, within, which, parts, of, language, develop, and, function, he, argues, that, the, bewitchments, of, philosophical, problems, arise, from, philosophers, misguided, attempts, to, consider, the, meaning, of, words, independently, of, their, context, usage, and, grammar, what, he, called, language, gone, on, holiday, according, to, wittgenstein, philosophical, problems, arise, when, language, is, forced, from, its, proper, home, into, a, metaphysical, environment, where, all, the, familiar, and, necessary, landmarks, and, contextual, clues, are, removed, he, describes, this, metaphysical, environment, as, like, being, on, frictionless, ice, where, the, conditions, are, apparently, perfect, for, a, philosophically, and, logically, perfect, language, all, philosophical, problems, can, be, solved, without, the, muddying, effects, of, everyday, contexts, but, where, precisely, because, of, the, lack, of, friction, language, can, in, fact, do, no, work, at, all, wittgenstein, argues, that, philosophers, must, leave, the, frictionless, ice, and, return, to, the, rough, ground, of, ordinary, language, in, use, much, of, the, investigations, consists, of, examples, of, how, the, first, false, steps, can, be, avoided, so, that, philosophical, problems, are, dissolved, rather, than, solved, the, clarity, we, are, aiming, at, is, indeed, complete, clarity, but, this, simply, means, that, the, philosophical, problems, should, completely, disappear, wittgenstein, s, archive, of, unpublished, papers, included, 83, manuscripts, 46, typescripts, and, 11, dictations, amounting, to, an, estimated, 20, 000, pages, choosing, among, repeated, drafts, revisions, corrections, and, loose, notes, editorial, work, has, found, nearly, one, third, of, the, total, suitable, for, print, an, internet, facility, hosted, by, the, university, of, bergen, allows, access, to, images, of, almost, all, the, material, and, to, search, the, available, transcriptions, in, 2011, two, new, boxes, of, wittgenstein, papers, thought, to, have, been, lost, during, the, second, world, war, were, found, what, became, the, philosophical, investigations, was, already, close, to, completion, in, 1951, wittgenstein, s, three, literary, executors, prioritized, it, both, because, of, its, intrinsic, importance, and, because, he, had, explicitly, intended, publication, the, book, was, published, in, 1953, at, least, three, other, works, were, more, or, less, finished, two, were, already, bulky, typescripts, the, philosophical, remarks, and, philosophical, grammar, literary, co, executor, g, h, von, wright, stated, they, are, virtually, completed, works, but, wittgenstein, did, not, publish, them, the, third, was, remarks, on, colour, he, wrote, i, a, a, fair, amount, on, colour, concepts, and, this, material, he, did, excerpt, and, polish, reducing, it, to, a, small, compass, bertrand, russell, described, wittgenstein, as, perhaps, the, most, perfect, example, i, have, ever, known, of, genius, as, traditionally, conceived, passionate, profound, intense, and, dominating, in, 1999, a, survey, among, american, university, and, college, teachers, ranked, the, investigations, as, the, most, important, book, of, 20th, century, philosophy, standing, out, as, the, one, crossover, masterpiece, in, twentieth, century, philosophy, appealing, across, diverse, specializations, and, philosophical, orientations, the, investigations, also, ranked, 54th, on, a, list, of, most, influential, twentieth, century, works, in, cognitive, science, prepared, by, the, university, of, minnesota, s, center, for, cognitive, sciences, duncan, j, richter, of, the, virginia, military, institute, writing, for, the, internet, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, has, described, wittgenstein, as, one, of, the, most, influential, philosophers, of, the, twentieth, century, and, regarded, by, some, as, the, most, important, since, immanuel, kant, peter, hacker, argues, that, wittgenstein, s, influence, on, 20th, century, analytical, philosophy, can, be, attributed, to, his, early, influence, on, the, vienna, circle, and, later, influence, on, the, oxford, ordinary, language, school, and, cambridge, philosophers, he, is, considered, by, some, to, be, one, of, the, greatest, philosophers, of, the, modern, era, but, despite, its, deep, influence, on, analytical, philosophy, wittgenstein, s, work, did, not, always, gain, a, positive, reception, argentine, canadian, philosopher, mario, bunge, considers, that, wittgenstein, is, popular, because, he, is, trivial, in, bunge, s, opinion, wittgenstein, s, philosophy, is, trivial, because, it, deals, with, unimportant, problems, and, ignores, science, according, to, bunge, wittgenstein, s, philosophy, of, language, is, shallow, because, it, ignores, scientific, linguistics, bunge, also, considers, wittgenstein, s, philosophy, of, mind, to, be, speculative, because, it, is, not, informed, by, the, scientific, research, performed, in, psychology, there, are, many, diverging, interpretations, of, wittgenstein, s, thought, in, the, words, of, his, friend, and, colleague, georg, henrik, von, wright, he, was, of, the, opinion, that, his, ideas, were, generally, misunderstood, and, distorted, even, by, those, who, professed, to, be, his, disciples, he, doubted, he, would, be, better, understood, in, the, future, he, once, said, he, felt, as, though, he, was, writing, for, people, who, would, think, in, a, different, way, breathe, a, different, air, of, life, from, that, of, present, day, men, since, wittgenstein, s, death, scholarly, interpretations, of, his, philosophy, have, differed, scholars, have, differed, on, the, continuity, between, the, so, called, early, wittgenstein, and, the, so, called, late, r, wittgenstein, that, is, the, difference, between, his, views, expressed, in, the, tractatus, and, those, in, philosophical, investigations, with, some, seeing, the, two, as, starkly, disparate, and, others, stressing, the, gradual, transition, between, the, two, works, through, analysis, of, wittgenstein, s, unpublished, papers, the, nachlass, one, significant, debate, in, wittgenstein, scholarship, concerns, the, work, of, interpreters, who, are, referred, to, under, the, banner, of, the, new, wittgenstein, school, such, as, cora, diamond, alice, crary, and, james, f, conant, while, the, tractatus, particularly, in, its, conclusion, seems, paradoxical, and, self, undermining, new, wittgenstein, scholars, advance, a, therapeutic, understanding, of, wittgenstein, s, work, an, understanding, of, wittgenstein, as, aspiring, not, to, advance, metaphysical, theories, but, rather, to, help, us, work, ourselves, out, of, confusions, we, become, entangled, in, when, philosophizing, to, support, this, goal, the, new, wittgenstein, scholars, propose, a, reading, of, the, tractatus, as, plain, nonsense, arguing, it, does, not, attempt, to, convey, a, substantive, philosophical, project, but, instead, simply, tries, to, push, the, reader, to, abandon, philosophical, speculation, the, therapeutic, approach, traces, its, roots, to, the, philosophical, work, of, john, wisdom, and, the, review, of, the, blue, book, written, by, oets, kolk, bouwsma, the, therapeutic, approach, is, not, without, critics, hans, johann, glock, argues, that, the, plain, nonsense, reading, of, the, tractatus, is, at, odds, with, the, external, evidence, writings, and, conversations, in, which, wittgenstein, states, that, the, tractatus, is, committed, to, the, idea, of, ineffable, insight, hans, sluga, and, rupert, read, have, advocated, a, post, therapeutic, or, liberatory, interpretation, of, wittgenstein, in, october, 1944, wittgenstein, returned, to, cambridge, around, the, same, time, as, did, russell, who, had, been, living, in, the, united, states, for, several, years, russell, returned, to, cambridge, after, a, backlash, in, the, us, to, his, writings, on, morals, and, religion, wittgenstein, said, of, russell, s, works, to, drury, russell, s, books, should, be, bound, in, two, colours, those, dealing, with, mathematical, logic, in, red, and, all, students, of, philosophy, should, read, them, those, dealing, with, ethics, and, politics, in, blue, and, no, one, should, be, allowed, to, read, them, russell, made, similar, disparaging, comments, about, wittgenstein, s, later, work, i, have, not, found, in, wittgenstein, s, philosophical, investigations, anything, that, seemed, to, me, interesting, and, i, do, not, understand, why, a, whole, school, finds, important, wisdom, in, its, pages, psychologically, this, is, surprising, the, earlier, wittgenstein, whom, i, knew, intimately, was, a, man, addicted, to, passionately, intense, thinking, profoundly, aware, of, difficult, problems, of, which, i, like, him, felt, the, importance, and, possessed, or, at, least, so, i, thought, of, true, philosophical, genius, the, later, wittgenstein, on, the, contrary, seems, to, have, grown, tired, of, serious, thinking, and, to, have, invented, a, doctrine, which, would, make, such, an, activity, unnecessary, i, do, not, for, one, moment, believe, that, the, doctrine, which, has, these, lazy, consequences, is, true, i, realize, however, that, i, have, an, overpoweringly, strong, bias, against, it, for, if, it, is, true, philosophy, is, at, best, a, slight, help, to, lexicographers, and, at, worst, an, idle, tea, table, amusement, saul, kripke, s, 1982, book, wittgenstein, on, rules, and, private, language, contends, that, the, central, argument, of, wittgenstein, s, philosophical, investigations, is, a, devastating, rule, following, paradox, that, undermines, the, possibility, of, our, ever, following, rules, in, our, use, of, language, kripke, writes, that, this, paradox, is, the, most, radical, and, original, sceptical, problem, that, philosophy, has, seen, to, date, kripke, s, book, generated, a, large, secondary, literature, divided, between, those, who, find, his, sceptical, problem, interesting, and, perceptive, and, others, such, as, john, mcdowell, stanley, cavell, gordon, baker, peter, hacker, colin, mcginn, and, peter, winch, who, argue, that, his, scepticism, of, meaning, is, a, pseudo, problem, that, stems, from, a, confused, selective, reading, of, wittgenstein, kripke, s, position, has, however, recently, been, defended, against, these, and, other, attacks, by, the, cambridge, philosopher, martin, kusch, 2006, a, collection, of, ludwig, wittgenstein, s, manuscripts, is, held, by, trinity, college, cambridge
