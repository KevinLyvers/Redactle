a, year, in, which, the, russian, civil, war, between, the, bolsheviks, and, a, coalition, of, opponents, known, as, the, white, army, began, in, earnest, his, biographer, william, taubman, suggests, that, khrushchev, s, delay, in, affiliating, himself, with, the, bolsheviks, was, because, he, felt, closer, to, the, mensheviks, who, prioritized, economic, progress, whereas, the, bolsheviks, sought, political, power, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, indicated, that, he, waited, because, there, were, many, groups, and, it, was, difficult, to, keep, them, all, straight, in, march, 1918, as,

as, commissar, to, a, construction, platoon, khrushchev, rose, to, become, commissar, to, a, construction, battalion, and, was, sent, from, the, front, for, a, two, month, political, course, the, young, commissar, came, under, fire, many, times, though, many, of, the, war, stories, he, would, tell, in, later, life, dealt, more, with, cultural, awkwardness, rather, than, combat, in, 1921, the,

directorship, of, the, nearby, pastukhov, mine, however, he, refused, the, offer, seeking, to, be, assigned, to, the, newly, established, technical, college, tekhnikum, in, yuzovka, though, his, superiors, were, reluctant, to, let, him, go, as, he, had, only, four, years, of, formal, schooling, he, applied, to, the, training, program, rabfak, short, for, rabotchyi, fakultyet, or, worker, s,

rabfak, khrushchev, continued, his, work, at, the, rutchenkovo, mine, one, of, his, teachers, later, described, him, as, a, poor, student, he, was, more, successful, in, advancing, in, the, communist, party, soon, after, his, admission, to, the, rabfak, in, august, 1922, he, was, appointed, party, secretary, of, the, entire, tekhnikum, and, became, a, member, of, the, bureau, the, governing,

question, of, party, democracy, all, of, these, activities, left, him, with, little, time, for, his, schoolwork, and, while, he, later, said, he, had, finished, his, rabfak, studies, it, is, unclear, whether, this, was, true, according, to, william, taubman, khrushchev, s, studies, were, aided, by, nina, petrovna, kukharchuk, a, well, educated, party, organizer, and, daughter, of, well, to, do, ukrainian, peasants, the, family, was, poor, according, to, nina, s, own, recollections, the, two, lived, together, as, husband, and, wife, for, the, rest, of, khrushchev, s, life, though, they,

constantly, on, the, move, throughout, his, domain, taking, an, interest, in, even, minor, matters, in, late, 1925, khrushchev, was, elected, a, non, voting, delegate, to, the, 14th, congress, of, the, ussr, communist, party, in, moscow, khrushchev, met, lazar, kaganovich, as, early, as, 1917, in, 1925, kaganovich, became, party, head, in, ukraine, and, khrushchev, falling, under, his, patronage, was, rapidly, promoted, he, was, appointed, second, in, command, of, stalin, s, party, apparatus, in, late, 1926, within, nine, months, his, superior, konstantin, moiseyenko, was, ousted, which, according, to, taubman, was, due, to, khrushchev, s, instigation, kaganovich, transferred, khrushchev, to, kharkov, then, the, capital, of, ukraine, as, head, of, the, organizational, department, of, the, ukrainian, party, s, central, committee, in, 1928, khrushchev, was, transferred, to, kiev, where, he, served, as, head, of, the, organizational, department, second, in, command, of, the, party, organization, there, in, 1929, khrushchev, again, sought, to, further, his, education, following, kaganovich, now, in, the, kremlin, as, a, close, associate, of, stalin, to, moscow, and, enrolling, in, the, stalin, industrial, academy, khrushchev, never, completed, his, studies, there, but, his, career, in, the, party, flourished, when, the, school, s, party, cell, elected, a, number, of, rightists, to, an, upcoming, district, party, conference, the, cell, was, attacked, in, pravda, khrushchev, emerged, victorious, in, the, ensuing, power, struggle, becoming, party, secretary, of, the, school, arranging, for, the, delegates, to, be, withdrawn, and, afterward, purging, the, cell, of, the, rightists, khrushchev, rose, rapidly, through, the, party, ranks, first, becoming, party, leader, for, the, bauman, district, site, of, the, academy, before, taking, the, same, position, in, the, krasnopresnensky, district, the, capital, s, largest, and, most, important, by, 1932, khrushchev, had, become, second, in, command, behind, kaganovich, of, the, moscow, city, party, organization, and, in, 1934, he, became, party, leader, for, the, city, and, a, member, of, the, party, s, central, committee, khrushchev, attributed, his, rapid, rise, to, his, acquaintance, with, fellow, academy, student, nadezhda, alliluyeva, stalin, s, wife, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, stated, that, alliluyeva, spoke, well, of, him, to, her, husband, his, biographer, william, tompson, downplays, the, possibility, stating, that, khrushchev, was, too, low, in, the, party, hierarchy, to, enjoy, stalin, s, patronage, and, that, if, influence, was, brought, to, bear, on, khrushchev, s, career, at, this, stage, it, was, by, kaganovich, while, head, of, the, moscow, city, organization, khrushchev, superintended, the, construction, of, the, moscow, metro, a, highly, expensive, undertaking, with, kaganovich, in, overall, charge, faced, with, an, already, announced, opening, date, of, 7, november, 1934, khrushchev, took, considerable, risks, in, the, construction, and, spent, much, of, his, time, down, in, the, tunnels, when, the, inevitable, accidents, did, occur, they, were, depicted, as, heroic, sacrifices, in, a, great, cause, the, metro, did, not, open, until, 1, may, 1935, but, khrushchev, received, the, order, of, lenin, for, his, role, in, its, construction, later, that, year, he, was, selected, as, first, secretary, of, the, moscow, regional, committee, which, was, responsible, for, moscow, oblast, a, province, with, a, population, of, 11, million, stalin, s, office, records, show, meetings, at, which, khrushchev, was, present, as, early, as, 1932, the, two, increasingly, built, a, good, relationship, khrushchev, greatly, admired, the, dictator, and, treasured, informal, meetings, with, him, and, invitations, to, stalin, s, dacha, while, stalin, felt, warm, affection, for, his, young, subordinate, beginning, in, 1934, stalin, began, a, campaign, of, political, repression, known, as, the, great, purge, during, which, many, were, executed, or, sent, to, the, gulag, central, to, this, campaign, were, the, moscow, trials, a, series, of, show, trials, of, the, purged, top, leaders, of, the, party, and, the, military, in, 1936, as, the, trials, proceeded, khrushchev, expressed, his, vehement, support, everyone, who, rejoices, in, the, successes, achieved, in, our, country, the, victories, of, our, party, led, by, the, great, stalin, will, find, only, one, word, suitable, for, the, mercenary, fascist, dogs, of, the, trotskyite,

province, only, 10, survived, the, purges, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, noted, that, almost, everyone, who, worked, with, him, was, arrested, by, party, protocol, khrushchev, was, required, to, approve, these, arrests, and, did, little, or, nothing, to, save, his, friends, and, colleagues, party, leaders, were, given, numerical, quotas, of, enemies, to, be, turned, in, and, arrested, in, june, 1937, the, politburo, set, a, quota, of, 35, 000, enemies, to, be, arrested, in, moscow, province, 5, 000, of, these, were, to, be, executed, in, reply, khrushchev, asked, that, 2, 000, wealthy, peasants, or, kulaks, living, in, moscow, be, killed, in, part, fulfillment, of, the, quota, in, any, event, only, two, weeks, after, receiving, the, order, khrushchev, was, able, to, report, to, stalin, that, 41, 305, criminal, and, kulak, elements, had, been, arrested, of, the, arrestees, according, to, khrushchev, 8, 500, deserved, execution, khrushchev, had, no, reason, to, think, himself, immune, from, the, purges, and, in, 1937, confessed, his, own, 1923, dalliance, with, trotskyism, to, kaganovich, who, according, to, khrushchev, blanched, for, his, prot, g, s, sins, could, affect, his, own, standing, and, advised, him, to, tell, stalin, the, dictator, took, the, confession, in, his, stride, and, after, initially, advising, khrushchev, to, keep, it, quiet, suggested, that, khrushchev, tell, his, tale, to, the, moscow, party, conference, khrushchev, did, so, to, applause, and, was, immediately, reelected, to, his, post, khrushchev, related, in, his, memoirs, that, he, was, also, denounced, by, an, arrested, colleague, stalin, told, khrushchev, of, the, accusation, personally, khrushchev, speculated, in, his, memoirs, that, had, stalin, doubted, his, reaction, he, would, have, been, categorized, as, an, enemy, of, the, people, then, and, there, nonetheless, khrushchev, became, a, candidate, member, of, the, politburo, on, 14, january, 1938, and, a, full, member, in, march, 1939, in, late, 1937, stalin, appointed, khrushchev, as, head, of, the, communist, party, in, ukraine, khrushchev, left, moscow, for, kiev, again, the, ukrainian, capital, in, january, 1938, ukraine, had, been, the, site, of, extensive, purges, with, the, murdered, including, professors, in, stalino, whom, khrushchev, greatly, respected, the, high, ranks, of, the, party, were, not, immune, the, central, committee, of, ukraine, was, so, devastated, that, it, could, not, convene, a, quorum, after, khrushchev, s, arrival, the, pace, of, arrests, accelerated, all, but, one, member, of, the, ukrainian, politburo, organizational, bureau, and, secretariat, were, arrested, almost, all, government, officials, and, red, army, commanders, were, replaced, during, the, first, few, months, after, khrushchev, s, arrival, almost, everyone, arrested, was, executed, biographer, william, taubman, suggested, that, because, khrushchev, was, again, unsuccessfully, denounced, while, in, kiev, he, must, have, known, that, some, of, the, denunciations, were, not, true, and, that, innocent, people, were, suffering, in, 1939, khrushchev, addressed, the, fourteenth, ukrainian, party, congress, saying, comrades, we, must, unmask, and, relentlessly, destroy, all, enemies, of, the, people, but, we, must, not, allow, a, single, honest, bolshevik, to, be, harmed, when, soviet, troops, pursuant, to, the, molotov, ribbentrop, pact, invaded, the, eastern, portion, of, poland, on, 17, september, 1939, khrushchev, accompanied, the, troops, at, stalin, s, direction, a, large, number, of, ethnic, ukrainians, lived, in, the, invaded, area, much, of, which, today, forms, the, western, portion, of, ukraine, many, inhabitants, initially, welcomed, the, invasion, though, they, hoped, that, they, would, eventually, become, independent, khrushchev, s, role, was, to, ensure, that, the, occupied, areas, voted, for, union, with, the, ussr, through, a, combination, of, propaganda, deception, as, to, what, was, being, voted, for, and, outright, fraud, the, soviets, ensured, that, the, assemblies, elected, in, the, new, territories, would, unanimously, petition, for, union, with, the, ussr, when, the, new, assemblies, did, so, their, petitions, were, granted, by, the, ussr, supreme, soviet, and, western, ukraine, became, a, part, of, the, ukrainian, soviet, socialist, republic, on, 1, november, 1939, clumsy, actions, by, the, soviets, such, as, staffing, western, ukrainian, organizations, with, eastern, ukrainians, and, giving, confiscated, land, to, collective, farms, kolkhozes, rather, than, to, peasants, soon, alienated, western, ukrainians, damaging, khrushchev, s, efforts, to, achieve, unity, when, nazi, germany, invaded, the, ussr, in, june,

military, commanders, and, the, political, rulers, in, moscow, stalin, used, khrushchev, to, keep, commanders, on, a, tight, leash, while, the, commanders, sought, to, have, him, influence, stalin, as, the, germans, advanced, khrushchev, worked, with, the, military, to, defend, and, save, kiev, handicapped, by, orders, from, stalin, that, under, no, circumstances, should, the, city, be, abandoned, the, red, army, was, soon, encircled, by, the, germans, while, the, germans, stated, they, took, 655, 000, prisoners, according, to, the, soviets, 150, 541, men, out, of, 677, 085, escaped, primary, sources, differ, on, khrushchev, s, involvement, according, to, marshal, georgy, zhukov, writing, some, years, after, khrushchev, fired, and, disgraced, him, in, 1957, khrushchev, persuaded, stalin, not, to, evacuate, troops, from, kiev, however, khrushchev, noted, in, his, memoirs, that, he, and, marshal, semyon, budyonny, proposed, redeploying, soviet, forces, to, avoid, the, encirclement, until, marshal, semyon, timoshenko, arrived, from, moscow, with, orders, for, the, troops, to, hold, their, positions, early, khrushchev, biographer, mark, frankland, suggested, that, khrushchev, s, faith, in, his, leader, was, first, shaken, by, the, red, army, s, setbacks, khrushchev, stated, in, his, memoirs, but, let, me, return, to, the, enemy, breakthrough, in, the, kiev, area, the, encirclement, of, our, group, and, the, destruction, of, the, 37th, army, later, the, fifth, army, also, perished, all, of, this, was, senseless, and, from, the, military, point, of, view, a, display, of, ignorance, incompetence, and, illiteracy, there, you, have, the, result, of, not, taking, a, step, backward, we, were, unable, to, save, these, troops, because, we, didn, t, withdraw, them, and, as, a, result, we, simply, lost, them, and, yet, it, was, possible, to, allow, this, not, to, happen, in, 1942, khrushchev, was, on, the, southwest, front, and, he, and, timoshenko, proposed, a, massive, counteroffensive, in, the, kharkov, area, stalin, approved, only, part, of, the, plan, but, 640, 000, red, army, soldiers, were, involved, in, the, offensive, the, germans, however, had, deduced, that, the, soviets, were, likely, to, attack, at, kharkov, and, set, a, trap, beginning, on, 12, may, 1942, the, soviet, offensive, initially, appeared, successful, but, within, five, days, the, germans, had, driven, deep, into, the, soviet, flanks, and, the, red, army, troops, were, in, danger, of, being, cut, off, stalin, refused, to, halt, the, offensive, and, the, red, army, divisions, were, soon, encircled, by, the, germans, the, ussr, lost, about, 267, 000, soldiers, including, more, than, 200, 000, captured, and, stalin, demoted, timoshenko, and, recalled, khrushchev, to, moscow, while, stalin, hinted, at, arresting, and, executing, khrushchev, he, allowed, the, commissar, to, return, to, the, front, by, sending, him, to, stalingrad, khrushchev, reached, the, stalingrad, front, in, august, 1942, soon, after, the, start, of, the, battle, for, the, city, his, role, in, the, stalingrad, defense, was, not, major, general, vasily, chuikov, who, led, the, city, s, defense, mentions, khrushchev, only, briefly, in, a, memoir, published, while, khrushchev, was, premier, but, to, the, end, of, his, life, he, was, proud, of, his, role, though, he, visited, stalin, in, moscow, on, occasion, he, remained, in, stalingrad, for, much, of, the, battle, and, was, nearly, killed, at, least, once, he, proposed, a, counterattack, only, to, find, that, georgy, zhukov, and, other, generals, had, already, planned, operation, uranus, a, plan, to, break, out, from, soviet, positions, and, encircle, and, destroy, the, germans, it, was, being, kept, secret, before, uranus, was, launched, khrushchev, spent, much, time, checking, on, troop, readiness, and, morale, interrogating, nazi, prisoners, and, recruiting, some, for, propaganda, purposes, soon, after, stalingrad, khrushchev, met, with, personal, tragedy, as, his, son, leonid, a, fighter, pilot, was, apparently, shot, down, and, killed, in, action, on, 11, march, 1943, the, circumstances, of, leonid, s, death, remain, obscure, and, controversial, as, none, of, his, fellow, fliers, stated, that, they, witnessed, him, being, shot, down, nor, was, his, plane, found, or, body, recovered, one, theory, has, leonid, surviving, the, crash, and, collaborating, with, the, germans, and, when, he, was, recaptured, by, the, soviets, stalin, ordering, him, shot, despite, khrushchev, pleading, for, his, life, this, supposed, killing, is, used, to, explain, why, khrushchev, later, denounced, stalin, while, there, is, no, supporting, evidence, for, this, account, in, soviet, files, some, historians, allege, that, leonid, khrushchev, s, file, was, tampered, with, after, the, war, in, later, years, leonid, khrushchev, s, wingmate, stated, that, he, saw, his, plane, disintegrate, but, did, not, report, it, khrushchev, biographer, taubman, speculates, that, this, omission, was, most, likely, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, being, seen, as, complicit, in, the, death, of, the, son, of, a, politburo, member, in, mid, 1943, leonid, s, wife, liuba, khrushcheva, was, arrested, on, accusations, of, spying, and, sentenced, to, five, years, in, a, labor, camp, and, her, son, by, another, relationship, tolya, was, placed, in, orphanages, leonid, s, daughter, yulia, was, raised, by, nikita, khrushchev, and, his, wife, after, uranus, forced, the, germans, into, retreat, khrushchev, served, on, other, fronts, of, the, war, he, was, attached, to, soviet, troops, at, the, battle, of, kursk, in, july, 1943, which, turned, back, the, last, major, german, offensive, on, soviet, soil, khrushchev, related, that, he, interrogated, an, ss, defector, learning, that, the, germans, intended, an, attack, a, claim, dismissed, by, his, biographer, taubman, as, almost, certainly, exaggerated, he, accompanied, soviet, troops, as, they, took, kiev, in, november, 1943, entering, the, shattered, city, as, soviet, forces, drove, out, german, troops, as, soviet, forces, met, with, greater, success, driving, the, nazis, westwards, towards, germany, nikita, khrushchev, became, increasingly, involved, in, reconstruction, work, in, ukraine, he, was, appointed, premier, of, the, ukrainian, ssr, in, addition, to, his, earlier, party, post, one, of, the, rare, instances, in, which, the, ukrainian, party, and, civil, leader, posts, were, held, by, one, person, according, to, khrushchev, biographer, william, tompson, it, is, difficult, to, assess, khrushchev, s, war, record, since, he, most, often, acted, as, part, of, a, military, council, and, it, is, not, possible, to, know, the, extent, to, which, he, influenced, decisions, however, tompson, points, to, the, fact, that, the, few, mentions, of, khrushchev, in, military, memoirs, published, during, the, brezhnev, era, were, generally, favorable, at, a, time, when, it, was, barely, possible, to, mention, khrushchev, in, print, in, any, context, tompson, suggests, that, these, favorable, mentions, indicate, that, military, officers, held, khrushchev, in, high, regard, almost, all, of, ukraine, had, been, occupied, by, the, germans, and, khrushchev, returned, to, his, domain, in, late, 1943, to, find, devastation, ukraine, s, industry, had, been, destroyed, and, agriculture, faced, critical, shortages, even, though, millions, of, ukrainians, had, been, taken, to, germany, as, workers, or, prisoners, of, war, there, was, insufficient, housing, for, those, who, remained, one, out, of, every, six, ukrainians, were, killed, in, world, war, ii, khrushchev, sought, to, reconstruct, ukraine, and, complete, the, interrupted, work, of, imposing, the, soviet, system, on, it, though, he, hoped, that, the, purges, of, the, 1930s, would, not, recur, as, ukraine, was, recovered, militarily, conscription, was, imposed, 750, 000, men, aged, between, nineteen, and, fifty, were, sent, to, join, the, red, army, other, ukrainians, joined, partisan, forces, seeking, an, independent, ukraine, khrushchev, rushed, from, district, to, district, through, ukraine, urging, the, depleted, labor, force, to, greater, efforts, he, made, a, short, visit, to, his, birthplace, of, kalinovka, finding, a, starving, population, with, only, a, third, of, the, men, who, had, joined, the, red, army, having, returned, khrushchev, did, what, he, could, to, assist, his, hometown, despite, khrushchev, s, efforts, in, 1945, ukrainian, industry, was, at, only, a, quarter, of, pre, war, levels, and, the, harvest, actually, dropped, from, that, of, 1944, when, the, entire, territory, of, ukraine, had, not, yet, been, retaken, in, an, effort, to, increase, agricultural, production, the, kolkhozes, collective, farms, were, empowered, to, expel, residents, who, were, not, pulling, their, weight, kolkhoz, leaders, used, this, as, an, excuse, to, expel, their, personal, enemies, invalids, and, the, elderly, sending, them, to, the, eastern, parts, of, the, soviet, union, khrushchev, viewed, this, policy, as, very, effective, and, recommended, its, adoption, elsewhere, to, stalin, he, also, worked, to, impose, collectivization, on, western, ukraine, lack, of, resources, and, armed, resistance, by, partisans, slowed, the, process, the, partisans, many, of, whom, fought, as, the, ukrainian, insurgent, army, upa, were, gradually, defeated, as, soviet, police, and, military, reported, killing, 110, 825, bandits, and, capturing, a, quarter, million, more, between, 1944, and, 1946, about, 600, 000, western, ukrainians, were, arrested, between, 1944, and, 1952, with, one, third, executed, and, the, remainder, imprisoned, or, exiled, to, the, east, the, war, years, of, 1944, and, 1945, had, seen, poor, harvests, and, 1946, saw, intense, drought, strike, ukraine, and, western, russia, despite, this, collective, and, state, farms, were, required, to, turn, over, 52, of, the, harvest, to, the, government, the, soviet, government, sought, to, collect, as, much, grain, as, possible, to, supply, communist, allies, in, eastern, europe, khrushchev, set, the, quotas, at, a, high, level, leading, stalin, to, expect, an, unrealistically, large, quantity, of, grain, from, ukraine, food, was, rationed, but, non, agricultural, rural, workers, throughout, the, ussr, were, given, no, ration, cards, the, inevitable, starvation, was, largely, confined, to, remote, rural, regions, and, was, little, noticed, outside, the, ussr, khrushchev, realizing, the, desperate, situation, in, late, 1946, repeatedly, appealed, to, stalin, for, aid, to, be, met, with, anger, and, resistance, when, letters, to, stalin, had, no, effect, khrushchev, flew, to, moscow, and, made, his, case, in, person, stalin, finally, gave, ukraine, limited, food, aid, and, money, to, set, up, free, soup, kitchens, however, khrushchev, s, political, standing, had, been, damaged, and, in, february, 1947, stalin, suggested, that, lazar, kaganovich, be, sent, to, ukraine, to, help, khrushchev, the, following, month, the, ukrainian, central, committee, removed, khrushchev, as, party, leader, in, favor, of, kaganovich, while, retaining, him, as, premier, soon, after, kaganovich, arrived, in, kiev, khrushchev, fell, ill, and, was, barely, seen, until, september, 1947, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, indicates, he, had, pneumonia, some, biographers, have, theorized, that, khrushchev, s, illness, was, entirely, political, out, of, fear, that, his, loss, of, position, was, the, first, step, towards, downfall, and, demise, however, khrushchev, s, children, remembered, their, father, as, having, been, seriously, ill, once, khrushchev, was, able, to, get, out, of, bed, he, and, his, family, took, their, first, vacation, since, before, the, war, to, a, beachfront, resort, in, latvia, khrushchev, though, soon, broke, the, beach, routine, with, duck, hunting, trips, and, a, visit, to, the, new, soviet, kaliningrad, where, he, toured, factories, and, quarries, by, the, end, of, 1947, kaganovich, had, been, recalled, to, moscow, and, the, recovered, khrushchev, had, been, restored, to, the, first, secretaryship, he, then, resigned, the, ukrainian, premiership, in, favor, of, demyan, korotchenko, khrushchev, s, prot, g, khrushchev, s, final, years, in, ukraine, were, generally, peaceful, with, industry, recovering, soviet, forces, overcoming, the, partisans, and, 1947, and, 1948, seeing, better, than, expected, harvests, collectivization, advanced, in, western, ukraine, and, khrushchev, implemented, more, policies, that, encouraged, collectivization, and, discouraged, private, farms, these, sometimes, backfired, however, a, tax, on, private, livestock, holdings, led, to, peasants, slaughtering, their, stock, with, the, idea, of, eliminating, differences, in, attitude, between, town, and, countryside, and, transforming, the, peasantry, into, a, rural, proletariat, khrushchev, conceived, the, idea, of, the, agro, town, rather, than, agricultural, workers, living, close, to, farms, they, would, live, further, away, in, larger, towns, which, would, offer, municipal, services, such, as, utilities, and, libraries, he, completed, only, one, such, town, before, his, december, 1949, return, to, moscow, he, dedicated, it, to, stalin, as, a, 70th, birthday, present, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, spoke, highly, of, ukraine, i, ll, say, that, the, ukrainian, people, treated, me, well, i, recall, warmly, the, years, i, spent, there, this, was, a, period, full, of, responsibilities, but, pleasant, because, it, brought, satisfaction, but, far, be, it, from, me, to, inflate, my, significance, the, entire, ukrainian, people, was, exerting, great, efforts, i, attribute, ukraine, s, successes, to, the, ukrainian, people, as, a, whole, i, won, t, elaborate, further, on, this, theme, but, in, principle, it, s, very, easy, to, demonstrate, i, m, russian, myself, and, i, don, t, want, to, offend, the, russians, from, mid, december, 1949, khrushchev, served, as, head, of, the, party, in, moscow, city, and, province, his, biographer, taubman, suggests, that, stalin, most, likely, recalled, khrushchev, to, moscow, to, balance, the, influence, of, georgy, malenkov, and, security, chief, lavrentiy, beria, who, were, widely, seen, as, stalin, s, heirs, the, aging, leader, rarely, called, politburo, meetings, instead, much, of, the, high, level, work, of, government, took, place, at, dinners, hosted, by, stalin, for, his, inner, circle, of, beria, malenkov, khrushchev, kaganovich, kliment, voroshilov, vyacheslav, molotov, and, nikolai, bulganin, khrushchev, took, early, naps, so, that, he, would, not, fall, asleep, in, stalin, s, presence, he, noted, in, his, memoirs, things, went, badly, for, those, who, dozed, off, at, stalin, s, table, in, 1950, khrushchev, began, a, large, scale, housing, program, for, moscow, five, or, six, story, apartment, buildings, became, ubiquitous, throughout, the, soviet, union, khrushchev, had, prefabricated, reinforced, concrete, used, greatly, speeding, up, construction, these, structures, were, completed, at, triple, the, construction, rate, of, moscow, housing, from, 1946, to, 1950, lacked, elevators, or, balconies, and, were, nicknamed, khrushchyovka, by, the, public, but, because, of, their, shoddy, workmanship, sometimes, disparagingly, called, khrushchoba, combining, khrushchev, s, name, with, the, russian, word, trushchoba, meaning, slum, in, 1995, almost, 60, 000, 000, residents, of, the, former, soviet, union, still, lived, in, these, buildings, in, his, new, positions, khrushchev, continued, his, kolkhoz, consolidation, scheme, which, decreased, the, number, of, collective, farms, in, moscow, oblast, by, about, 70, this, resulted, in, farms, that, were, too, large, for, one, chairman, to, manage, effectively, khrushchev, also, sought, to, implement, his, agro, town, proposal, but, when, his, lengthy, speech, on, the, subject, was, published, in, pravda, in, march, 1951, stalin, disapproved, of, it, the, periodical, quickly, published, a, note, stating, that, khrushchev, s, speech, was, merely, a, proposal, not, policy, in, april, the, politburo, disavowed, the, agro, town, proposal, khrushchev, feared, that, stalin, would, remove, him, from, office, but, the, leader, mocked, khrushchev, then, allowed, the, episode, to, pass, on, 1, march, 1953, stalin, had, a, massive, stroke, as, terrified, doctors, attempted, treatment, khrushchev, and, his, colleagues, engaged, in, an, intense, discussion, as, to, the, new, government, on, 5, march, stalin, died, khrushchev, later, reflected, on, stalin, stalin, called, everyone, who, didn, t, agree, with, him, an, enemy, of, the, people, he, said, that, they, wanted, to, restore, the, old, order, and, for, this, purpose, the, enemies, of, the, people, had, linked, up, with, the, forces, of, reaction, internationally, as, a, result, several, hundred, thousand, honest, people, perished, everyone, lived, in, fear, in, those, days, everyone, expected, that, at, any, moment, there, would, be, a, knock, on, the, door, in, the, middle, of, the, night, and, that, knock, on, the, door, would, prove, fatal, eople, not, to, stalin, s, liking, were, annihilated, honest, party, members, irreproachable, people, loyal, and, hard, workers, for, our, cause, who, had, gone, through, the, school, of, revolutionary, struggle, under, lenin, s, leadership, this, was, utter, and, complete, arbitrariness, and, now, is, all, this, to, be, forgiven, and, forgotten, never, on, 6, march, 1953, stalin, s, death, was, announced, as, was, the, new, leadership, malenkov, was, the, new, chairman, of, the, council, of, ministers, with, beria, who, consolidated, his, hold, over, the, security, agencies, kaganovich, bulganin, and, former, foreign, minister, vyacheslav, molotov, as, first, vice, chairmen, those, members, of, the, presidium, of, the, central, committee, who, had, been, recently, promoted, by, stalin, were, demoted, khrushchev, was, relieved, of, his, duties, as, party, head, for, moscow, to, concentrate, on, unspecified, duties, in, the, party, s, central, committee, the, new, york, times, listed, malenkov, and, beria, first, and, second, among, the, ten, man, presidium, and, khrushchev, last, however, malenkov, resigned, from, the, secretariat, of, the, central, committee, on, 14, march, this, came, due, to, concerns, that, he, was, acquiring, too, much, power, the, major, beneficiary, was, khrushchev, his, name, appeared, atop, a, revised, list, of, secretaries, indicating, that, he, was, now, in, charge, of, the, party, the, central, committee, formally, elected, him, first, secretary, in, september, after, stalin, s, death, beria, launched, a, number, of, reforms, according, to, taubman, unparalleled, in, his, cynicism, he, did, not, let, ideology, stand, in, his, way, had, he, prevailed, he, would, almost, certainly, have, exterminated, his, colleagues, if, only, to, prevent, them, from, liquidating, him, in, the, meantime, however, his, burst, of, reforms, rivaled, khrushchev, s, and, in, some, ways, even, gorbachev, s, one, proposal, which, was, adopted, was, an, amnesty, which, eventually, led, to, the, freeing, of, over, a, million, non, political, prisoners, another, which, was, not, adopted, was, to, release, east, germany, into, a, united, neutral, germany, in, exchange, for, compensation, from, the, west, a, proposal, considered, by, khrushchev, to, be, anti, communist, khrushchev, allied, with, malenkov, to, block, many, of, beria, s, proposals, while, the, two, slowly, picked, up, support, from, other, presidium, members, their, campaign, against, beria, was, aided, by, fears, that, beria, was, planning, a, military, coup, and, according, to, khrushchev, in, his, memoirs, by, the, conviction, that, beria, is, getting, his, knives, ready, for, us, the, key, move, by, khrushchev, and, malenkov, was, to, lure, two, of, beria, s, most, powerful, deputy, ministers, sergei, kruglov, and, ivan, serov, to, betray, their, boss, this, allowed, khrushchev, and, malenkov, to, arrest, beria, as, beria, belatedly, discovered, he, had, lost, control, of, ministry, of, interior, troops, and, the, troops, of, the, kremlin, guard, on, 26, june, 1953, beria, was, arrested, at, a, presidium, meeting, following, extensive, military, preparations, by, khrushchev, and, his, allies, beria, was, tried, in, secret, and, executed, in, december, 1953, with, five, of, his, close, associates, the, power, struggle, continued, malenkov, s, power, was, in, the, central, state, apparatus, which, he, sought, to, extend, through, reorganizing, the, government, giving, it, additional, power, at, the, expense, of, the, party, he, also, sought, public, support, by, lowering, retail, prices, and, the, level, of, bond, sales, to, citizens, which, had, long, been, effectively, obligatory, khrushchev, with, his, power, base, in, the, party, sought, to, strengthen, the, party, and, his, position, within, it, while, under, the, soviet, system, the, party, was, to, be, preeminent, it, had, been, greatly, drained, of, power, by, stalin, who, had, given, much, of, that, power, to, himself, and, to, the, politburo, later, to, the, presidium, khrushchev, saw, that, with, the, presidium, in, conflict, the, party, and, its, central, committee, might, again, become, powerful, khrushchev, carefully, cultivated, high, party, officials, and, was, able, to, appoint, supporters, as, local, party, bosses, who, then, took, seats, on, the, central, committee, khrushchev, presented, himself, as, a, down, to, earth, activist, prepared, to, take, up, any, challenge, contrasting, with, malenkov, who, though, sophisticated, came, across, as, colourless, khrushchev, arranged, for, the, kremlin, grounds, to, be, opened, to, the, public, an, act, with, great, public, resonance, while, both, malenkov, and, khrushchev, sought, reforms, to, agriculture, khrushchev, s, proposals, were, broader, and, included, the, virgin, lands, campaign, under, which, hundreds, of, thousands, of, young, volunteers, would, settle, and, farm, areas, of, western, siberia, and, northern, kazakhstan, while, the, scheme, eventually, became, a, tremendous, disaster, for, soviet, agriculture, it, was, initially, successful, in, addition, khrushchev, possessed, incriminating, information, on, malenkov, taken, from, beria, s, secret, files, as, soviet, prosecutors, investigated, the, atrocities, of, stalin, s, last, years, including, the, leningrad, case, they, came, across, evidence, of, malenkov, s, involvement, beginning, in, february, 1954, khrushchev, replaced, malenkov, in, the, seat, of, honour, at, presidium, meetings, in, june, malenkov, ceased, to, head, the, list, of, presidium, members, which, was, thereafter, organized, in, alphabetical, order, khrushchev, s, influence, continued, to, increase, winning, the, allegiance, of, local, party, heads, and, with, his, nominee, heading, the, kgb, in, 1954, the, soviet, leadership, with, khrushchev, transferred, crimea, from, the, russian, sfsr, to, the, ukrainian, ssr, a, decision, often, attributed, to, khrushchev, s, origin, other, historians, though, point, more, to, the, pacification, of, inner, soviet, tensions, and, to, a, move, in, the, power, game, with, malenkov, at, a, central, committee, meeting, in, january, 1955, malenkov, was, accused, of, involvement, in, atrocities, and, the, committee, passed, a, resolution, accusing, him, of, involvement, in, the, leningrad, case, and, of, facilitating, beria, s, climb, to, power, at, a, meeting, of, the, mostly, ceremonial, supreme, soviet, the, following, month, malenkov, was, demoted, in, favor, of, bulganin, to, the, surprise, of, western, observers, malenkov, remained, in, the, presidium, as, minister, of, electric, power, stations, according, to, khrushchev, biographer, william, tompson, khrushchev, s, position, as, first, among, the, members, of, the, collective, leadership, was, now, beyond, any, reasonable, doubt, the, post, stalin, battle, for, political, control, reshaped, foreign, policy, there, was, more, realism, and, less, ideological, abstraction, when, confronted, by, european, and, middle, eastern, situations, khrushchev, s, secret, speech, attack, on, stalin, in, 1956, was, a, signal, for, abandoning, stalinist, precepts, and, looking, at, new, options, including, more, involvement, in, the, middle, east, khrushchev, in, power, did, not, moderate, his, personality, he, remained, unpredictable, and, was, emboldened, by, the, spectacular, successes, in, space, he, thought, that, would, give, the, ussr, world, prestige, leading, to, quick, communist, advances, in, the, third, world, khrushchev, s, policy, was, still, restrained, by, the, need, to, retain, the, support, of, the, presidium, and, to, placate, the, inarticulate, but, restive, soviet, masses, who, were, thrilled, by, sputnik, but, demanded, a, higher, standard, of, living, on, the, ground, as, well, after, the, demotion, of, malenkov, khrushchev, and, molotov, initially, worked, together, well, molotov, even, proposed, that, khrushchev, not, bulganin, replace, malenkov, as, premier, however, khrushchev, and, molotov, increasingly, differed, on, policy, molotov, opposed, the, virgin, lands, policy, instead, proposing, heavy, investment, to, increase, yields, in, developed, agricultural, areas, which, khrushchev, felt, was, not, feasible, due, to, a, lack, of, resources, and, a, lack, of, a, sophisticated, farm, labor, force, the, two, differed, on, foreign, policy, as, well, soon, after, khrushchev, took, power, he, sought, a, peace, treaty, with, austria, which, would, allow, soviet, troops, then, occupying, part, of, the, country, to, leave, molotov, was, resistant, but, khrushchev, arranged, for, an, austrian, delegation, to, come, to, moscow, and, negotiate, the, treaty, although, khrushchev, and, other, presidium, members, attacked, molotov, at, a, central, committee, meeting, in, mid, 1955, accusing, him, of, conducting, a, foreign, policy, which, turned, the, world, against, the, ussr, molotov, remained, in, his, position, by, the, end, of, 1955, thousands, of, political, prisoners, had, returned, home, and, told, their, experiences, of, the, gulag, labor, camps, continuing, investigation, into, the, abuses, brought, home, the, full, breadth, of, stalin, s, crimes, to, his, successors, working, together, with, his, close, ally, anastas, mikoyan, khrushchev, believed, that, once, the, stain, of, stalinism, was, removed, the, party, would, inspire, loyalty, among, the, people, beginning, in, october, 1955, khrushchev, fought, to, tell, the, delegates, to, the, upcoming, 20th, party, congress, about, stalin, s, crimes, some, of, his, colleagues, including, molotov, and, malenkov, opposed, the, disclosure, and, persuaded, him, to, make, his, remarks, in, a, closed, session, the, 20th, party, congress, opened, on, 14, february, 1956, in, his, opening, words, in, his, initial, address, khrushchev, denigrated, stalin, by, asking, delegates, to, rise, in, honour, of, the, communist, leaders, who, had, died, since, the, last, congress, whom, he, named, equating, stalin, with, klement, gottwald, and, the, little, known, kyuichi, tokuda, in, the, early, morning, of, 25, february, khrushchev, delivered, what, became, known, as, the, secret, speech, to, a, closed, session, of, the, congress, limited, to, soviet, delegates, in, four, hours, he, demolished, stalin, s, reputation, khrushchev, noted, in, his, memoirs, that, the, congress, listened, to, me, in, silence, as, the, saying, goes, you, could, have, heard, a, pin, drop, it, was, all, so, sudden, and, unexpected, khrushchev, told, the, delegates, it, is, here, that, stalin, showed, in, a, whole, series, of, cases, his, intolerance, his, brutality, and, his, abuse, of, power, he, often, chose, the, path, of, repression, and, physical, annihilation, not, only, against, actual, enemies, but, also, against, individuals, who, had, not, committed, any, crimes, against, the, party, or, the, soviet, government, the, secret, speech, did, not, fundamentally, change, soviet, society, but, had, wide, ranging, effects, the, speech, was, a, factor, in, unrest, in, poland, and, revolution, in, hungary, later, in, 1956, and, stalin, defenders, led, four, days, of, rioting, in, his, native, georgia, in, june, calling, for, khrushchev, to, resign, and, molotov, to, take, over, in, meetings, where, the, secret, speech, was, read, communists, would, make, even, more, severe, condemnations, of, stalin, and, of, khrushchev, and, even, call, for, multi, party, elections, however, stalin, was, not, publicly, denounced, and, his, portrait, remained, widespread, through, the, ussr, from, airports, to, khrushchev, s, kremlin, office, mikhail, gorbachev, then, a, komsomol, official, recalled, that, though, young, and, well, educated, soviets, in, his, district, were, excited, by, the, speech, many, others, decried, it, either, defending, stalin, or, seeing, little, point, in, digging, up, the, past, forty, years, later, after, the, fall, of, the, soviet, union, gorbachev, applauded, khrushchev, for, his, courage, in, taking, a, huge, political, risk, and, showing, himself, to, be, a, moral, man, after, all, the, term, secret, speech, proved, to, be, an, utter, misnomer, while, the, attendees, at, the, speech, were, all, soviet, eastern, european, delegates, were, allowed, to, hear, it, the, following, night, read, slowly, to, allow, them, to, take, notes, by, 5, march, copies, were, being, mailed, throughout, the, soviet, union, marked, not, for, the, press, rather, than, top, secret, an, official, translation, appeared, within, a, month, in, poland, the, poles, printed, 12, 000, extra, copies, one, of, which, soon, reached, the, west, khrushchev, s, son, sergei, later, wrote, clearly, father, tried, to, ensure, it, would, reach, as, many, ears, as, possible, it, was, soon, read, at, komsomol, meetings, that, meant, another, eighteen, million, listeners, if, you, include, their, relatives, friends, and, acquaintances, you, could, say, that, the, entire, country, became, familiar, with, the, speech, spring, had, barely, begun, when, the, speech, began, circulating, around, the, world, the, anti, khrushchev, minority, in, the, presidium, was, augmented, by, those, opposed, to, khrushchev, s, proposals, to, decentralize, authority, over, industry, which, struck, at, the, heart, of, malenkov, s, power, base, during, the, first, half, of, 1957, malenkov, molotov, and, kaganovich, worked, to, quietly, build, support, to, dismiss, khrushchev, at, an, 18, june, presidium, meeting, at, which, two, khrushchev, supporters, were, absent, the, plotters, moved, that, bulganin, who, had, joined, the, scheme, take, the, chair, and, proposed, other, moves, which, would, effectively, demote, khrushchev, and, put, themselves, in, control, khrushchev, objected, on, the, grounds, that, not, all, presidium, members, had, been, notified, an, objection, which, would, have, been, quickly, dismissed, had, khrushchev, not, held, firm, control, over, the, military, through, minister, of, defense, marshal, zhukov, and, the, security, departments, lengthy, presidium, meetings, took, place, continuing, over, several, days, as, word, leaked, of, the, power, struggle, members, of, the, central, committee, which, khrushchev, controlled, streamed, to, moscow, many, flown, there, aboard, military, planes, and, demanded, to, be, admitted, to, the, meeting, while, they, were, not, admitted, there, were, soon, enough, central, committee, members, in, moscow, to, call, an, emergency, party, congress, which, effectively, forced, the, leadership, to, allow, a, session, of, the, central, committee, at, that, meeting, the, three, main, conspirators, were, dubbed, the, anti, party, group, and, denounced, with, accusations, of, factionalism, and, complicity, in, stalin, s, crimes, the, three, were, expelled, from, the, central, committee, and, presidium, as, was, former, foreign, minister, and, khrushchev, client, dmitri, shepilov, who, joined, them, in, the, plot, molotov, was, sent, as, ambassador, to, mongolia, the, others, were, sent, to, head, industrial, facilities, and, institutes, far, from, moscow, marshal, zhukov, was, rewarded, for, his, support, with, full, membership, in, the, presidium, but, khrushchev, feared, his, popularity, and, power, in, october, 1957, the, defense, minister, was, sent, on, a, tour, of, the, balkans, as, khrushchev, arranged, a, presidium, meeting, to, dismiss, him, zhukov, learned, what, was, happening, and, hurried, back, to, moscow, only, to, be, formally, notified, of, his, dismissal, at, a, central, committee, meeting, several, weeks, later, not, a, word, was, said, in, zhukov, s, defense, khrushchev, completed, the, consolidation, of, power, in, march, 1958, arranging, for, bulganin, s, dismissal, as, premier, in, favor, of, himself, bulganin, was, appointed, to, head, the, gosbank, and, by, establishing, a, ussr, defense, council, led, by, himself, effectively, making, him, commander, in, chief, though, khrushchev, was, now, preeminent, he, did, not, enjoy, stalin, s, absolute, power, after, assuming, power, khrushchev, allowed, a, modest, amount, of, freedom, in, the, arts, vladimir, dudintsev, s, novel, not, by, bread, alone, about, an, idealistic, engineer, opposed, by, rigid, bureaucrats, was, allowed, to, be, published, in, 1956, though, khrushchev, called, the, novel, false, at, its, base, in, 1958, however, khrushchev, ordered, a, fierce, attack, on, boris, pasternak, after, his, novel, doctor, zhivago, was, published, abroad, he, was, denied, permission, to, publish, it, in, the, soviet, union, pravda, described, the, novel, as, low, grade, reactionary, hackwork, and, the, author, was, expelled, from, the, writer, s, union, pasternak, was, awarded, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, but, under, heavy, pressure, he, declined, it, once, he, did, so, khrushchev, ordered, a, halt, to, the, attacks, on, pasternak, in, his, memoirs, khrushchev, stated, that, he, agonized, over, the, novel, very, nearly, allowed, it, to, be, published, and, later, regretted, not, doing, so, after, his, fall, from, power, khrushchev, read, the, novel, he, had, earlier, read, only, excerpts, and, stated, we, shouldn, t, have, banned, it, i, should, have, read, it, myself, there, s, nothing, anti, soviet, in, it, khrushchev, believed, that, the, ussr, could, match, the, west, s, living, standards, and, was, not, afraid, to, allow, soviet, citizens, to, see, western, achievements, stalin, had, permitted, few, tourists, to, the, soviet, union, and, had, allowed, few, soviets, to, travel, khrushchev, let, soviets, travel, over, two, million, soviet, citizens, travelled, abroad, between, 1957, and, 1961, 700, 000, of, whom, visited, the, west, and, allowed, foreigners, to, visit, the, soviet, union, where, tourists, became, subjects, of, immense, curiosity, in, 1957, khrushchev, authorized, the, 6th, world, festival, of, youth, and, students, to, be, held, in, moscow, that, summer, he, instructed, komsomol, officials, to, smother, foreign, guests, in, our, embrace, the, resulting, socialist, carnival, involved, over, three, million, moscovites, who, joined, with, 30, 000, young, foreign, visitors, in, events, that, ranged, from, discussion, groups, throughout, the, city, to, events, at, the, kremlin, itself, according, to, historian, vladislav, zubok, the, festival, shattered, propagandist, clich, s, about, westerners, by, allowing, moscovites, to, see, them, for, themselves, in, 1962, khrushchev, impressed, by, aleksandr, solzhenitsyn, s, one, day, in, the, life, of, ivan, denisovich, persuaded, the, presidium, to, allow, publication, that, renewed, thaw, ended, on, 1, december, 1962, when, khrushchev, was, taken, to, the, manezh, gallery, to, view, an, exhibit, which, included, a, number, of, avant, garde, works, on, seeing, them, khrushchev, exploded, with, anger, an, episode, known, as, the, manege, affair, describing, the, artwork, as, dog, shit, and, proclaiming, that, a, donkey, could, smear, better, art, with, its, tail, a, week, later, pravda, issued, a, call, for, artistic, purity, when, writers, and, filmmakers, defended, the, painters, khrushchev, extended, his, anger, to, them, however, despite, the, premier, s, rage, none, of, the, artists, were, arrested, or, exiled, the, manezh, gallery, exhibit, remained, open, and, experienced, a, considerable, rise, in, attendance, after, the, article, in, pravda, under, khrushchev, the, special, tribunals, operated, by, security, agencies, were, abolished, these, tribunals, known, as, troikas, had, often, ignored, laws, and, procedures, under, the, reforms, no, prosecution, for, a, political, crime, could, be, brought, even, in, the, regular, courts, unless, approved, by, the, local, party, committee, this, rarely, happened, there, were, no, major, political, trials, under, khrushchev, and, at, most, several, hundred, political, prosecutions, overall, instead, other, sanctions, were, imposed, on, soviet, dissidents, including, loss, of, job, or, university, position, or, expulsion, from, the, party, during, khrushchev, s, rule, forced, hospitalization, for, the, socially, dangerous, was, introduced, according, to, author, roy, medvedev, who, wrote, an, early, analysis, of, khrushchev, s, years, in, power, political, terror, as, an, everyday, method, of, government, was, replaced, under, khrushchev, by, administrative, means, of, repression, in, 1958, khrushchev, opened, a, central, committee, meeting, to, hundreds, of, soviet, officials, some, were, even, allowed, to, address, the, meeting, for, the, first, time, the, proceedings, of, the, committee, were, made, public, in, book, form, a, practice, which, was, continued, at, subsequent, meetings, this, openness, however, actually, allowed, khrushchev, greater, control, over, the, committee, since, dissenters, would, have, to, make, their, case, in, front, of, a, large, disapproving, crowd, in, 1962, khrushchev, divided, oblast, level, party, committees, obkoms, into, two, parallel, structures, one, for, industry, and, one, for, agriculture, this, was, unpopular, among, party, apparatchiks, and, led, to, confusions, in, the, chain, of, command, as, neither, committee, secretary, had, precedence, over, the, other, as, there, were, limited, numbers, of, central, committee, seats, from, each, oblast, the, division, set, up, the, possibility, of, rivalry, for, office, between, factions, and, according, to, medvedev, had, the, potential, for, beginning, a, two, party, system, khrushchev, also, ordered, that, one, third, of, the, membership, of, each, committee, from, low, level, councils, to, the, central, committee, itself, be, replaced, at, each, election, this, decree, created, tension, between, khrushchev, and, the, central, committee, and, upset, the, party, leaders, upon, whose, support, khrushchev, had, risen, to, power, khrushchev, was, an, expert, on, agricultural, policies, and, sensed, an, urgent, need, to, reform, the, backward, inefficient, system, with, ideas, that, worked, in, the, us, he, looked, especially, at, collectivism, state, farms, liquidation, of, machine, tractor, stations, planning, decentralization, economic, incentives, increased, labor, and, capital, investment, new, crops, and, new, production, programs, henry, ford, had, been, at, the, center, of, american, technology, transfer, to, the, soviet, union, in, the, 1930s, he, sent, over, factory, designs, engineers, and, skilled, craftsmen, as, well, as, tens, of, thousands, of, ford, tractors, by, the, 1940s, khrushchev, was, keenly, interested, in, american, agricultural, innovations, especially, on, large, scale, family, operated, farms, in, the, midwest, in, the, 1950s, he, sent, several, delegations, to, visit, farms, and, land, grant, colleges, looking, at, successful, farms, that, utilized, high, yielding, seed, varieties, very, large, and, powerful, tractors, and, other, machines, all, guided, by, modern, management, techniques, especially, after, his, visit, to, the, us, in, 1959, he, was, keenly, aware, of, the, need, to, emulate, and, even, match, american, superiority, and, agricultural, technology, khrushchev, became, a, hyper, enthusiastic, crusader, to, grow, corn, maize, he, established, a, corn, institute, in, ukraine, and, ordered, thousands, of, hectares, to, be, planted, in, the, virgin, lands, in, 1955, khrushchev, advocated, an, iowa, style, corn, belt, in, the, soviet, union, and, a, soviet, delegation, visited, the, u, s, state, that, summer, the, delegation, chief, was, approached, by, farmer, and, corn, seed, salesman, roswell, garst, who, persuaded, him, to, visit, garst, s, large, farm, the, iowan, visited, the, soviet, union, where, he, became, friends, with, khrushchev, and, garst, sold, the, ussr, 4, 500, metric, tons, 5, 000, short, tons, of, seed, corn, garst, warned, the, soviets, to, grow, the, corn, in, the, southern, part, of, the, country, and, to, ensure, there, were, sufficient, stocks, of, fertilizer, insecticides, and, herbicides, this, however, was, not, done, as, khrushchev, sought, to, plant, corn, even, in, siberia, and, without, the, necessary, chemicals, the, corn, experiment, was, not, a, great, success, and, he, later, complained, that, overenthusiastic, officials, had, overplanted, without, laying, the, proper, groundwork, and, as, a, result, corn, was, discredited, as, a, silage, crop, and, so, was, i, khrushchev, sought, to, abolish, the, machine, tractor, stations, mts, which, not, only, owned, most, large, agricultural, machines, but, also, provided, services, such, as, plowing, and, transfer, their, equipment, and, functions, to, the, kolkhozes, and, sovkhozes, state, farms, after, a, successful, test, involving, mts, which, served, one, large, kolkhoz, each, khrushchev, ordered, a, gradual, transition, but, then, ordered, that, the, change, take, place, with, great, speed, within, three, months, over, half, of, the, mts, facilities, had, been, closed, and, kolkhozes, were, being, required, to, buy, the, equipment, with, no, discount, given, for, older, or, dilapidated, machines, mts, employees, unwilling, to, bind, themselves, to, kolkhozes, and, lose, their, state, employee, benefits, and, the, right, to, change, their, jobs, fled, to, the, cities, creating, a, shortage, of, skilled, operators, the, costs, of, the, machinery, plus, the, costs, of, building, storage, sheds, and, fuel, tanks, for, the, equipment, impoverished, many, kolkhozes, inadequate, provisions, were, made, for, repair, stations, without, the, mts, the, market, for, soviet, agricultural, equipment, fell, apart, as, the, kolkhozes, now, had, neither, the, money, nor, skilled, buyers, to, purchase, new, equipment, in, the, 1940s, stalin, put, trofim, lysenko, in, charge, of, agricultural, research, with, his, ideas, that, flouted, modern, genetics, science, lysenko, maintained, his, influence, under, khrushchev, and, helped, block, the, adoption, of, american, techniques, in, 1959, khrushchev, announced, a, goal, of, overtaking, the, us, in, the, production, of, milk, meat, and, butter, local, officials, kept, khrushchev, happy, with, unrealistic, pledges, of, production, these, goals, were, met, by, farmers, who, slaughtered, their, breeding, herds, and, by, purchasing, meat, at, state, stores, then, reselling, it, back, to, the, government, artificially, increasing, recorded, production, in, june, 1962, food, prices, were, raised, particularly, on, meat, and, butter, by, 25, 30, this, caused, public, discontent, in, the, southern, russian, city, of, novocherkassk, this, discontent, escalated, to, a, strike, and, a, revolt, against, the, authorities, the, revolt, was, put, down, by, the, military, resulting, in, a, massacre, that, killed, 22, people, and, wounded, 87, according, to, soviet, official, accounts, in, addition, 116, demonstrators, were, convicted, of, involvement, and, seven, were, executed, information, about, the, revolt, was, completely, suppressed, in, the, ussr, but, spread, through, samizdat, and, damaged, khrushchev, s, reputation, in, the, west, drought, struck, the, soviet, union, in, 1963, the, harvest, of, 97, 500, 000, t, 107, 500, 000, short, tons, of, grain, was, down, from, a, peak, of, 122, 200, 000, t, 134, 700, 000, short, tons, in, 1958, the, shortages, resulted, in, bread, lines, a, fact, at, first, kept, from, khrushchev, reluctant, to, purchase, food, in, the, west, but, faced, with, the, alternative, of, widespread, hunger, khrushchev, exhausted, the, nation, s, hard, currency, reserves, and, expended, part, of, its, gold, stockpile, in, the, purchase, of, grain, and, other, foodstuffs, while, visiting, the, united, states, in, 1959, khrushchev, was, impressed, by, the, agricultural, education, program, at, iowa, state, university, and, sought, to, imitate, it, in, the, soviet, union, at, the, time, the, main, agricultural, college, in, the, ussr, was, in, moscow, and, students, did, not, do, the, manual, labor, of, farming, khrushchev, proposed, moving, the, programs, to, rural, areas, he, was, unsuccessful, due, to, resistance, from, professors, and, students, who, never, actually, disagreed, with, the, premier, but, who, did, not, carry, out, his, proposals, khrushchev, recalled, in, his, memoirs, it, s, nice, to, live, in, moscow, and, work, at, the, timiryazev, agricultural, academy, it, s, a, venerable, old, institution, a, large, economic, unit, with, skilled, instructors, but, it, s, in, the, city, its, students, aren, t, yearning, to, work, on, the, collective, farms, because, to, do, that, they, d, have, to, go, out, in, the, provinces, and, live, in, the, sticks, khrushchev, founded, several, academic, towns, such, as, akademgorodok, the, premier, believed, that, western, science, flourished, because, many, scientists, lived, in, university, towns, such, as, oxford, isolated, from, big, city, distractions, and, had, pleasant, living, conditions, and, good, pay, he, sought, to, duplicate, those, conditions, khrushchev, s, attempt, was, generally, successful, though, his, new, towns, and, scientific, centres, tended, to, attract, younger, scientists, with, older, ones, unwilling, to, leave, moscow, or, leningrad, khrushchev, also, proposed, to, restructure, soviet, high, schools, while, the, high, schools, provided, a, college, preparatory, curriculum, few, soviet, youths, went, on, to, university, khrushchev, wanted, to, shift, the, focus, of, secondary, schools, to, vocational, training, in, practice, schools, developed, links, with, nearby, enterprises, and, students, went, to, work, for, only, one, or, two, days, a, week, the, organizations, disliked, having, to, teach, while, students, and, their, families, complained, that, they, had, little, choice, in, what, trade, to, learn, while, the, vocational, proposal, would, not, survive, khrushchev, s, downfall, a, longer, lasting, change, was, a, related, establishment, of, specialized, high, schools, these, schools, were, modeled, after, the, foreign, language, schools, that, had, been, established, in, moscow, and, leningrad, beginning, in, 1949, in, 1962, a, special, summer, school, was, established, in, novosibirsk, to, prepare, students, for, the, siberian, math, and, science, olympiad, the, following, year, the, novosibirsk, maths, and, science, boarding, school, became, the, first, permanent, residential, school, specializing, in, math, and, science, other, such, schools, were, soon, established, in, moscow, leningrad, and, kiev, by, the, early, 1970s, over, 100, specialized, schools, had, been, established, in, mathematics, the, sciences, art, music, and, sport, preschool, education, was, increased, as, part, of, khrushchev, s, reforms, and, by, the, time, he, left, office, about, 22, of, soviet, children, attended, preschool, about, half, of, urban, children, but, only, about, 12, of, rural, children, the, anti, religious, campaign, of, the, khrushchev, era, began, in, 1959, coinciding, with, the, 21st, party, congress, it, was, carried, out, by, mass, closures, of, churches, reducing, the, number, from, 22, 000, in, 1959, to, 13, 008, in, 1960, and, to, 7, 873, by, 1965, monasteries, convents, and, seminaries, the, campaign, also, included, a, restriction, on, parental, rights, to, teach, religion, to, their, children, a, ban, on, the, presence, of, children, at, church, services, and, a, ban, on, the, administration, of, the, eucharist, to, children, over, the, age, of, four, khrushchev, additionally, banned, all, services, held, outside, of, churches, walls, renewed, enforcement, of, 1929, legislation, banning, pilgrimages, and, recorded, the, personal, identities, of, all, adults, requesting, church, baptisms, weddings, or, funerals, he, disallowed, the, ringing, of, church, bells, and, services, in, daytime, in, some, rural, settings, from, may, to, the, end, of, october, under, the, pretext, of, fieldwork, requirements, non, fulfillment, of, these, regulations, by, clergy, would, lead, to, disallowance, of, state, registration, meaning, clergy, could, no, longer, do, any, pastoral, or, liturgical, work, without, special, state, permission, according, to, dimitry, pospielovsky, the, state, carried, out, forced, retirement, arrests, and, prison, sentences, for, clergymen, on, trumped, up, charges, but, in, reality, he, writes, said, state, actions, were, taken, against, clergy, who, resisted, the, closure, of, churches, delivered, sermons, attacking, the, ussr, s, state, atheism, and, anti, religious, campaign, conducted, christian, charity, or, made, religion, popular, by, personal, example, from, 1950, to, 1953, khrushchev, was, well, placed, to, closely, observe, and, evaluate, stalin, s, foreign, policy, khrushchev, considered, the, entire, cold, war, to, be, a, serious, mistake, on, stalin, s, part, in, the, long, term, it, created, an, unnecessary, and, expensive, militarized, struggle, with, nato, it, diverted, attention, away, from, the, neutral, developing, world, where, progress, could, be, made, and, it, weakened, moscow, s, relationship, with, its, east, european, satellites, basically, khrushchev, was, much, more, optimistic, about, the, future, than, stalin, or, molotov, and, was, more, of, an, internationalist, he, believed, the, working, classes, and, the, common, peoples, of, the, world, would, eventually, find, their, way, towards, socialism, and, even, communism, and, that, conflicts, like, the, cold, war, diverted, their, attention, from, this, eventual, goal, peaceful, coexistence, of, the, sort, that, lenin, himself, had, practiced, at, first, would, allow, the, soviet, union, and, its, satellite, states, to, build, up, their, economies, and, their, standard, of, living, khrushchev, decided, that, stalin, had, made, a, series, of, mistakes, such, as, heavy, handed, pressure, in, turkey, and, iran, in, 1945, and, 1946, and, especially, heavy, pressure, on, berlin, that, led, to, the, failed, berlin, blockade, in, 1948, germany, was, a, major, issue, for, khrushchev, not, because, he, feared, a, nato, invasion, eastward, but, because, it, weakened, the, east, german, regime, which, economically, paled, in, comparison, to, the, economic, progress, of, west, germany, khrushchev, blamed, molotov, for, being, unable, to, resolve, the, conflict, with, yugoslavia, and, largely, ignoring, the, needs, of, the, east, european, communist, satellites, khrushchev, chose, austria, as, a, way, to, quickly, come, to, agreement, with, nato, it, became, a, small, neutralized, nation, economically, tied, to, the, west, but, diplomatically, neutral, and, no, threat, when, khrushchev, took, control, the, outside, world, still, knew, little, of, him, and, initially, was, not, impressed, by, him, short, heavyset, and, wearing, ill, fitting, suits, he, radiated, energy, but, not, intellect, and, was, dismissed, by, many, as, a, buffoon, who, would, not, last, long, british, foreign, secretary, harold, macmillan, wondered, how, can, this, fat, vulgar, man, with, his, pig, eyes, and, ceaseless, flow, of, talk, be, the, head, the, aspirant, tsar, for, all, those, millions, of, people, khrushchev, biographer, tompson, stated, he, could, be, charming, or, vulgar, ebullient, or, sullen, he, was, given, to, public, displays, of, rage, often, contrived, and, to, soaring, hyperbole, in, his, rhetoric, but, whatever, he, was, however, he, came, across, he, was, more, human, than, his, predecessor, or, even, than, most, of, his, foreign, counterparts, and, for, much, of, the, world, that, was, enough, to, make, the, ussr, seem, less, mysterious, or, menacing, khrushchev, sought, to, find, a, lasting, solution, to, the, problem, of, a, divided, germany, and, of, the, enclave, of, west, berlin, in, november, 1958, calling, west, berlin, a, malignant, tumor, he, gave, the, united, states, united, kingdom, and, france, six, months, to, conclude, a, peace, treaty, with, both, german, states, and, the, soviet, union, if, one, was, not, signed, khrushchev, stated, the, soviet, union, would, conclude, a, peace, treaty, with, east, germany, this, would, leave, east, germany, which, was, not, a, party, to, treaties, giving, the, western, powers, access, to, berlin, in, control, of, the, routes, to, the, city, they, proposed, making, berlin, a, free, city, which, meant, no, outside, military, forces, would, be, stationed, there, west, germany, united, states, and, france, strongly, opposed, the, ultimatum, but, britain, wanted, to, consider, it, as, a, starting, point, for, negotiations, no, one, wanted, to, risk, war, over, the, issue, at, britain, s, request, khrushchev, extended, and, ultimately, dropped, the, ultimatum, as, the, berlin, issue, became, part, of, the, complex, agenda, of, high, level, summit, meetings, khrushchev, sought, to, sharply, reduce, levels, of, conventional, weapons, and, to, defend, the, soviet, union, with, missiles, he, believed, that, without, this, transition, the, huge, soviet, military, would, continue, to, eat, up, resources, making, khrushchev, s, goals, of, improving, soviet, life, difficult, to, achieve, he, abandoned, stalin, s, plans, for, a, large, navy, in, 1955, believing, that, the, new, ships, would, be, too, vulnerable, to, either, a, conventional, or, nuclear, attack, in, january, 1960, he, took, advantage, of, improved, relations, with, the, u, s, to, order, a, reduction, of, one, third, in, the, size, of, soviet, armed, forces, alleging, that, advanced, weapons, would, make, up, for, the, lost, troops, while, conscription, of, soviet, youth, remained, in, force, exemptions, from, military, service, became, more, and, more, common, especially, for, students, campbell, craig, and, sergey, radchenko, argue, that, khrushchev, thought, that, policies, like, mutually, assured, destruction, mad, were, too, dangerous, for, the, soviet, union, his, approach, did, not, greatly, change, his, foreign, policy, or, military, doctrine, but, is, apparent, in, his, determination, to, choose, options, that, minimized, the, risk, of, war, the, soviets, had, few, operable, intercontinental, ballistic, missiles, icbm, but, khrushchev, publicly, boasted, of, the, soviets, missile, programs, stating, that, soviet, weapons, were, varied, and, numerous, the, first, secretary, hoped, that, public, perception, that, the, soviets, were, ahead, would, put, psychological, pressure, on, the, west, resulting, in, political, concessions, the, soviet, space, program, which, khrushchev, firmly, supported, appeared, to, confirm, his, claims, when, the, soviets, launched, sputnik, 1, into, orbit, a, feat, that, astonished, the, world, western, governments, concluded, that, the, soviet, icbm, program, was, further, along, than, it, actually, was, khrushchev, added, to, this, misapprehension, by, stating, in, an, october, 1957, interview, that, the, ussr, had, all, the, rockets, of, whatever, capacity, that, it, needed, for, years, khrushchev, would, make, a, point, of, preceding, a, major, foreign, trip, with, a, rocket, launch, to, the, discomfiture, of, his, hosts, in, january, 1960, khrushchev, told, the, presidium, that, soviet, icbms, made, an, agreement, with, the, u, s, possible, because, main, street, americans, have, begun, to, shake, from, fear, for, the, first, times, in, their, lives, the, united, states, had, learned, of, the, underdeveloped, state, of, the, soviet, missile, program, from, overflights, in, the, late, 1950s, but, only, high, u, s, officials, knew, of, the, deception, the, perception, of, a, missile, gap, led, to, a, considerable, defense, buildup, on, the, part, of, the, united, states, during, vice, president, nixon, s, visit, to, the, soviet, union, in, 1959, he, and, khrushchev, took, part, in, what, later, became, known, as, the, kitchen, debate, nixon, and, khrushchev, had, an, impassioned, argument, in, a, model, kitchen, at, the, american, national, exhibition, in, moscow, with, each, defending, the, economic, system, of, his, country, nixon, invited, khrushchev, to, visit, the, united, states, and, he, agreed, he, made, his, first, visit, to, the, united, states, arriving, in, washington, on, 15, september, 1959, spending, thirteen, days, in, the, country, this, first, visit, by, a, soviet, premier, resulted, in, an, extended, media, circus, khrushchev, brought, his, wife, and, adult, children, with, him, though, it, was, not, usual, for, soviet, officials, to, travel, with, their, families, he, visited, new, york, city, los, angeles, san, francisco, visiting, a, supermarket, coon, rapids, iowa, visiting, roswell, garst, s, farm, pittsburgh, and, washington, concluding, with, a, meeting, with, president, eisenhower, at, camp, david, during, luncheon, at, the, twentieth, century, fox, studio, in, los, angeles, khrushchev, engaged, in, an, improvised, yet, jovial, debate, with, his, host, spyros, skouras, over, the, merits, of, capitalism, and, communism, khrushchev, was, also, to, visit, disneyland, but, the, visit, was, canceled, for, security, reasons, much, to, his, disgruntlement, he, did, however, visit, eleanor, roosevelt, at, her, home, while, visiting, ibm, s, new, research, campus, in, san, jose, california, khrushchev, expressed, little, interest, in, computer, technology, but, he, greatly, admired, the, self, service, cafeteria, and, on, his, return, introduced, self, service, in, the, soviet, union, this, visit, resulted, in, an, informal, agreement, that, there, would, be, no, firm, deadline, over, berlin, but, that, there, would, be, a, four, power, summit, to, try, to, resolve, the, issue, the, russian, s, goal, was, to, present, warmth, charm, and, peacefulness, using, candid, interviews, to, convince, americans, of, his, humanity, and, good, will, he, performed, well, and, theodore, windt, calls, it, the, zenith, of, his, career, the, friendly, american, audiences, convinced, khrushchev, that, he, had, achieved, a, strong, personal, relationship, with, eisenhower, and, that, he, could, achieve, d, tente, with, the, americans, eisenhower, was, actually, unimpressed, by, the, soviet, leader, he, pushed, for, an, immediate, summit, but, was, frustrated, by, french, president, charles, de, gaulle, who, postponed, it, until, 1960, a, year, in, which, eisenhower, was, scheduled, to, pay, a, return, visit, to, the, soviet, union, a, constant, irritant, in, soviet, u, s, relations, was, the, overflight, of, the, soviet, union, by, american, u, 2, spy, aircraft, on, 9, april, 1960, the, u, s, resumed, such, flights, after, a, lengthy, break, the, soviets, had, protested, the, flights, in, the, past, but, had, been, ignored, by, washington, content, in, what, he, thought, was, a, strong, personal, relationship, with, eisenhower, khrushchev, was, confused, and, angered, by, the, flights, resumption, and, concluded, that, they, had, been, ordered, by, cia, director, allen, dulles, without, eisenhower, s, knowledge, khrushchev, planned, to, visit, the, u, s, to, meet, eisenhower, but, the, visit, was, canceled, when, soviet, air, defence, forces, brought, down, the, u, s, u, 2, on, 1, may, a, u, 2, was, shot, down, its, pilot, francis, gary, powers, captured, alive, believing, powers, to, have, been, killed, the, u, s, announced, that, a, weather, plane, had, been, lost, near, the, turkish, soviet, border, khrushchev, risked, destroying, the, summit, due, to, start, on, 16, may, in, paris, if, he, announced, the, shootdown, but, would, look, weak, in, the, eyes, of, his, military, and, security, forces, if, he, did, nothing, on, 5, may, khrushchev, announced, the, shootdown, and, powers, capture, blaming, the, overflight, on, imperialist, circles, and, militarists, whose, stronghold, is, the, pentagon, and, suggesting, the, plane, had, been, sent, without, eisenhower, s, knowledge, eisenhower, could, not, have, it, thought, that, there, were, rogue, elements, in, the, pentagon, operating, without, his, knowledge, and, admitted, that, he, had, ordered, the, flights, calling, them, a, distasteful, necessity, the, admission, stunned, khrushchev, and, turned, the, u, 2, affair, from, a, possible, triumph, to, a, disaster, for, him, and, he, even, appealed, to, u, s, ambassador, llewellyn, thompson, for, help, khrushchev, was, undecided, what, to, do, at, the, summit, even, as, he, boarded, his, flight, he, finally, decided, in, consultation, with, his, advisers, on, the, plane, and, presidium, members, in, moscow, to, demand, an, apology, from, eisenhower, and, a, promise, that, there, would, be, no, further, u, 2, flights, in, soviet, airspace, neither, eisenhower, nor, khrushchev, communicated, with, the, other, in, the, days, before, the, summit, and, at, the, summit, khrushchev, made, his, demands, and, stated, that, there, was, no, purpose, in, the, summit, which, should, be, postponed, for, six, to, eight, months, until, after, the, 1960, united, states, presidential, election, the, u, s, president, offered, no, apology, but, stated, that, the, flights, had, been, suspended, and, would, not, resume, and, renewed, his, open, skies, proposal, for, mutual, overflight, rights, this, was, not, enough, for, khrushchev, who, left, the, summit, eisenhower, accused, khrushchev, of, sabotaging, this, meeting, on, which, so, much, of, the, hopes, of, the, world, have, rested, eisenhower, s, visit, to, the, soviet, union, for, which, the, premier, had, even, built, a, golf, course, so, the, u, s, president, could, enjoy, his, favorite, sport, was, cancelled, by, khrushchev, khrushchev, made, his, second, and, final, visit, to, the, us, in, september, 1960, he, had, no, invitation, but, had, appointed, himself, as, head, of, the, ussr, s, un, delegation, he, spent, much, of, his, time, wooing, the, new, third, world, states, which, had, recently, become, independent, the, u, s, restricted, him, to, the, island, of, manhattan, with, visits, to, an, estate, owned, by, the, ussr, on, long, island, the, notorious, shoe, banging, incident, occurred, during, a, debate, on, 12, october, over, a, soviet, resolution, decrying, colonialism, khrushchev, was, infuriated, by, a, statement, of, the, filipino, delegate, lorenzo, sumulong, charging, the, soviets, with, employing, a, double, standard, by, decrying, colonialism, while, dominating, eastern, europe, khrushchev, demanded, the, right, to, reply, immediately, and, accused, sumulong, of, being, a, fawning, lackey, of, the, american, imperialists, sumulong, accused, the, soviets, of, hypocrisy, khrushchev, yanked, off, his, shoe, and, began, banging, it, on, his, desk, this, behavior, by, khrushchev, scandalized, his, delegation, khrushchev, considered, u, s, vice, president, nixon, a, hardliner, and, was, delighted, by, his, defeat, in, the, 1960, presidential, election, he, considered, the, victor, john, f, kennedy, as, a, far, more, likely, partner, for, d, tente, but, was, taken, aback, by, the, newly, inaugurated, u, s, president, s, tough, talk, and, actions, in, the, early, days, of, his, administration, khrushchev, achieved, a, propaganda, victory, in, april, 1961, with, the, first, human, spaceflight, while, kennedy, suffered, a, defeat, with, the, failure, of, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, while, khrushchev, had, threatened, to, defend, cuba, with, soviet, missiles, the, premier, contented, himself, with, after, the, fact, aggressive, remarks, the, failure, in, cuba, led, to, kennedy, s, determination, to, make, no, concessions, at, the, vienna, summit, scheduled, for, 3, june, 1961, both, kennedy, and, khrushchev, took, a, hard, line, with, khrushchev, demanding, a, treaty, that, would, recognize, the, two, german, states, and, refusing, to, yield, on, the, remaining, issues, obstructing, a, test, ban, treaty, kennedy, in, contrast, had, been, led, to, believe, that, the, test, ban, treaty, could, be, concluded, at, the, summit, and, felt, that, a, deal, on, berlin, had, to, await, easing, of, east, west, tensions, an, indefinite, postponement, of, action, over, berlin, was, unacceptable, to, khrushchev, if, for, no, other, reason, than, that, east, germany, was, suffering, a, continuous, brain, drain, as, highly, educated, east, germans, fled, west, through, berlin, while, the, boundary, between, the, two, german, states, had, elsewhere, been, fortified, berlin, administered, by, the, four, allied, powers, remained, open, emboldened, by, statements, from, former, u, s, ambassador, to, moscow, charles, e, bohlen, and, united, states, senate, committee, on, foreign, relations, chairman, j, william, fulbright, that, east, germany, had, every, right, to, close, its, borders, khrushchev, authorized, east, german, leader, walter, ulbricht, to, begin, construction, of, what, became, known, as, the, berlin, wall, construction, preparations, were, made, in, great, secrecy, and, the, border, was, sealed, off, in, the, early, hours, of, sunday, 13, august, 1961, when, most, east, german, workers, who, earned, hard, currency, by, working, in, west, berlin, would, be, at, their, homes, the, wall, was, a, propaganda, disaster, and, marked, the, end, of, khrushchev, s, attempts, to, conclude, a, peace, treaty, among, the, four, powers, and, the, two, german, states, that, treaty, would, not, be, signed, until, september, 1990, as, an, immediate, prelude, to, german, reunification, superpower, tensions, culminated, in, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, the, ussr, the, caribbean, crisis, of, october, 1962, as, the, soviet, union, sought, to, install, medium, range, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, about, 90, miles, 140, km, from, the, u, s, coast, cuban, prime, minister, fidel, castro, was, reluctant, to, accept, the, missiles, and, once, he, was, persuaded, warned, khrushchev, against, transporting, the, missiles, in, secret, castro, stated, thirty, years, later, we, had, a, sovereign, right, to, accept, the, missiles, we, were, not, violating, international, law, why, do, it, secretly, as, if, we, had, no, right, to, do, it, i, warned, nikita, that, secrecy, would, give, the, imperialists, the, advantage, on, 16, october, kennedy, was, informed, that, u, 2, flights, over, cuba, had, discovered, what, were, most, likely, medium, range, missile, sites, and, though, he, and, his, advisors, considered, approaching, khrushchev, through, diplomatic, channels, they, could, come, up, with, no, way, of, doing, this, that, would, not, appear, weak, on, 22, october, kennedy, addressed, his, nation, by, television, revealing, the, missiles, presence, and, announcing, a, blockade, of, cuba, informed, in, advance, of, the, speech, but, not, until, one, hour, before, the, content, khrushchev, and, his, advisors, feared, an, invasion, of, cuba, even, before, kennedy, s, speech, they, ordered, soviet, commanders, in, cuba, that, they, could, use, all, weapons, against, an, attack, except, atomic, weapons, as, the, crisis, unfolded, tensions, were, high, in, the, u, s, less, so, in, the, soviet, union, where, khrushchev, made, several, public, appearances, and, went, to, the, bolshoi, theatre, to, hear, american, opera, singer, jerome, hines, by, 25, october, with, the, soviets, unclear, about, kennedy, s, full, intentions, khrushchev, decided, that, the, missiles, would, have, to, be, withdrawn, from, cuba, khrushchev, agreed, to, withdraw, the, missiles, in, exchange, for, a, u, s, promise, not, to, invade, cuba, and, a, secret, promise, that, the, u, s, would, withdraw, missiles, from, turkey, as, the, last, term, was, not, publicly, announced, at, the, request, of, the, u, s, and, was, not, known, until, just, before, khrushchev, s, death, in, 1971, the, resolution, was, seen, as, a, great, defeat, for, the, soviets, and, contributed, to, khrushchev, s, fall, less, than, two, years, later, castro, had, urged, khrushchev, to, launch, a, preemptive, nuclear, attack, on, the, u, s, in, the, event, of, an, invasion, of, cuba, and, was, angered, by, the, outcome, referring, to, khrushchev, in, profane, terms, after, the, crisis, superpower, relations, improved, as, kennedy, gave, a, conciliatory, speech, on, 10, june, 1963, recognizing, the, soviet, people, s, suffering, during, world, war, ii, and, paying, tribute, to, their, achievements, khrushchev, called, the, speech, the, best, by, a, u, s, president, since, franklin, d, roosevelt, and, in, july, negotiated, a, test, ban, treaty, with, u, s, negotiator, averell, harriman, and, lord, hailsham, of, the, united, kingdom, plans, for, a, second, khrushchev, kennedy, summit, were, dashed, by, kennedy, s, assassination, in, november, 1963, the, new, u, s, president, lyndon, johnson, hoped, for, continued, improved, relations, but, was, distracted, by, other, issues, and, had, little, opportunity, to, develop, a, relationship, with, khrushchev, before, the, premier, was, ousted, the, secret, speech, combined, with, the, death, of, the, polish, communist, leader, boles, aw, bierut, who, suffered, a, heart, attack, while, reading, the, speech, sparked, considerable, liberalization, in, poland, and, hungary, in, poland, a, worker, s, strike, in, pozna, developed, into, disturbances, that, left, more, than, 50, dead, in, june, 1956, when, moscow, blamed, the, disturbances, on, western, agitators, polish, leaders, ignored, the, claim, and, made, concessions, to, the, workers, with, anti, soviet, displays, becoming, more, common, in, poland, and, crucial, polish, leadership, elections, upcoming, khrushchev, and, other, presidium, members, flew, to, warsaw, on, 19, october, to, meet, with, the, polish, presidium, the, soviets, agreed, to, allow, the, new, polish, leadership, to, take, office, on, the, assurance, there, would, be, no, change, to, the, soviet, polish, relationship, a, period, of, at, least, partial, liberalization, known, as, the, polish, october, followed, the, polish, settlement, emboldened, the, hungarians, a, mass, demonstration, in, budapest, on, 23, october, turned, into, a, popular, uprising, in, response, hungarian, party, leaders, installed, reformist, premier, imre, nagy, soviet, forces, in, the, city, clashed, with, hungarians, and, fired, on, demonstrators, with, hundreds, of, both, hungarians, and, soviets, killed, nagy, called, for, a, cease, fire, and, a, withdrawal, of, soviet, troops, which, a, khrushchev, led, majority, in, the, presidium, decided, to, obey, choosing, to, give, the, new, hungarian, government, a, chance, khrushchev, assumed, that, if, moscow, announced, liberalization, in, how, it, dealt, with, its, allies, nagy, would, adhere, to, the, alliance, with, the, soviet, union, on, 30, october, nagy, announced, multiparty, elections, and, the, next, morning, that, hungary, would, leave, the, warsaw, pact, on, 3, november, two, members, of, the, nagy, government, appeared, in, ukraine, as, the, self, proclaimed, heads, of, a, provisional, government, and, demanded, soviet, intervention, which, was, forthcoming, the, next, day, soviet, troops, crushed, the, hungarian, uprising, with, a, death, toll, of, 4, 000, hungarians, and, several, hundred, soviet, troops, nagy, was, arrested, and, later, executed, despite, the, international, outrage, over, the, intervention, khrushchev, defended, his, actions, for, the, rest, of, his, life, damage, to, soviet, foreign, relations, was, severe, and, would, have, been, greater, were, it, not, for, the, timing, of, the, suez, crisis, which, distracted, world, attention, in, the, aftermath, of, these, crises, khrushchev, made, the, statement, for, which, he, became, well, remembered, we, will, bury, you, while, many, in, the, west, took, this, statement, as, a, threat, khrushchev, made, the, statement, in, a, speech, on, peaceful, coexistence, with, the, west, when, questioned, about, the, statement, during, his, 1959, u, s, visit, khrushchev, stated, that, he, was, not, referring, to, a, literal, burial, but, that, through, inexorable, historical, development, communism, would, replace, capitalism, khrushchev, greatly, improved, relations, with, yugoslavia, which, had, been, entirely, sundered, in, 1948, when, stalin, realized, he, could, not, control, yugoslav, leader, josip, tito, khrushchev, led, a, soviet, delegation, to, belgrade, in, 1955, though, a, hostile, tito, did, everything, he, could, to, make, the, soviets, look, foolish, khrushchev, was, successful, in, warming, relations, ending, the, informbiro, period, during, the, hungarian, crisis, tito, initially, supported, nagy, but, khrushchev, persuaded, him, of, the, need, for, intervention, still, the, intervention, in, hungary, damaged, moscow, s, relationship, with, belgrade, which, khrushchev, spent, several, years, trying, to, repair, he, was, hampered, by, the, fact, that, china, disapproved, of, yugoslavia, s, reformist, socialism, and, attempts, to, conciliate, belgrade, resulted, in, an, angry, beijing, after, completing, his, takeover, of, mainland, china, in, 1949, mao, zedong, sought, material, assistance, from, the, ussr, and, also, called, for, the, return, to, china, of, territories, taken, from, it, under, the, tsars, khrushchev, increased, aid, to, china, even, sending, a, small, corps, of, experts, to, help, develop, the, new, communist, country, this, assistance, was, described, by, historian, william, c, kirby, as, the, greatest, transfer, of, technology, in, world, history, the, soviet, union, spent, 7, of, its, national, income, between, 1954, and, 1959, on, aid, to, china, on, his, 1954, visit, to, china, khrushchev, agreed, to, return, port, arthur, and, dalian, to, china, though, khrushchev, was, annoyed, by, mao, s, insistence, that, the, soviets, leave, their, artillery, mao, bitterly, opposed, khrushchev, s, attempts, to, reach, a, rapprochement, with, more, liberal, eastern, european, states, such, as, yugoslavia, khrushchev, s, government, was, reluctant, to, endorse, mao, s, desires, for, an, assertive, worldwide, revolutionary, movement, preferring, to, conquer, capitalism, through, raising, the, standard, of, living, in, communist, bloc, countries, relations, between, the, two, nations, began, to, cool, in, 1956, with, mao, angered, both, by, the, secret, speech, and, by, the, fact, that, the, chinese, had, not, been, consulted, in, advance, about, it, mao, believed, that, de, stalinization, was, a, mistake, and, a, possible, threat, to, his, own, authority, when, khrushchev, visited, beijing, in, 1958, mao, refused, proposals, for, military, cooperation, hoping, to, torpedo, khrushchev, s, efforts, at, d, tente, with, the, u, s, mao, soon, thereafter, provoked, the, second, taiwan, strait, crisis, describing, the, taiwanese, islands, as, batons, that, keep, eisenhower, and, khrushchev, dancing, scurrying, this, way, and, that, the, soviets, had, planned, to, provide, china, with, an, atomic, bomb, and, full, documentation, but, in, 1959, amid, cooler, relations, the,

independent, ghana, and, guinea, these, were, seen, as, ideal, places, to, test, the, socialist, model, of, development, because, of, their, critical, dependence, on, economic, cooperation, with, the, soviet, union, in, contrast, to, larger, third, world, nations, like, egypt, and, indonesia, this, project, proved, to, be, a, resounding, failure, although, the, lessons, learned, would, have, an,

instead, persuaded, members, of, the, central, committee, to, support, the, ousting, of, khrushchev, remembering, how, crucial, the, committee, s, support, had, been, to, khrushchev, in, defeating, the, anti, party, group, plot, brezhnev, had, ample, time, for, his, conspiracy, as, khrushchev, was, absent, from, moscow, for, a, total, of, five, months, between, january, and, september, 1964,

guards, semichastny, informed, khrushchev, of, his, ouster, and, told, him, not, to, resist, the, plotters, coup, went, off, smoothly, khrushchev, felt, betrayed, by, semichastny, as, he, considered, him, a, friend, not, suspecting, that, he, had, joined, his, enemies, within, the, party, khrushchev, was, then, taken, to, the, kremlin, to, be, verbally, attacked, by, brezhnev, suslov, and, shelepin, he, put, up, little, resistance, semichastny, was, careful, not, to, create, the, appearance, of, a, coup, i, didn, t, even, close, the, kremlin, to, visitors, people, were, strolling, around, outside, while, in, the, room, the, presidium, was, meeting, i, deployed, my, men, around, the, kremlin, everything, that, was, necessary, was, done, brezhnev, and, shelepin, were, nervous, i,
