november, 30, 1939, in, a, letter, to, his, daughter, sophie, he, stated, i, had, not, wanted, to, undertake, the, responsibility, of, commander, in, chief, as, my, age, and, my, health, entitled, me, but, i, had, to, yield, to, appeals, from, the, president, of, the, republic, and, the, government, and, now, for, the, fourth, time, i, am, at, war, he, addressed, the, first, of, his, often, controversial, orders, of, the, day, to, the, defence, forces, on, the, day, the, war, began, the, president, of, the, republic, has, appointed, me, on, 30, november, 1939, as, commander, in, chief, of, the, armed, forces, of, the, country, brave, soldiers, of, finland, i, enter, on, this, task, at, a, time, when, our, hereditary, enemy, is, once, again, attacking, our, country, confidence, in, one, s, commander, is, the, first, condition, for, success, you, know, me, and, i, know, you, and, know, that, everyone, in, the, ranks, is, ready, to, do, his, duty, even, to, death, this, war, is, nothing, other, than, the, continuation, and, final, act, of, our, war, of, independence, we, are, fighting, for, our, homes, our, faith, and, our, country, the, defensive, field, fortifications, they, manned, became, known, as, the, mannerheim, line, field, marshal, mannerheim, quickly, organised, his, headquarters, in, mikkeli, his, chief, of, staff, was, lieutenant, general, aksel, airo, while, his, close, friend, general, rudolf, walden, was, sent, as, a, representative, of, the, headquarters, to, the, cabinet, from, 3, december, 1939, until, 27, march, 1940, after, which, he, became, defence, minister, mannerheim, spent, most, of, the, winter, war, and, continuation, war, in, his, mikkeli, headquarters, but, made, many, visits, to, the, front, between, the, wars, he, remained, commander, in, chief, although, mannerheim, s, main, task, was, to, lead, the, war, he, also, knew, how, to, strengthen, and, maintain, the, will, of, the, soldiers, to, fight, he, was, famed, for, this, quote, forts, cannons, and, foreign, aid, will, not, help, unless, every, man, himself, knows, that, he, is, the, guard, of, his, country, mannerheim, kept, relations, with, adolf, hitler, s, government, as, formal, as, possible, mannerheim, did, not, really, appreciate, hitler, even, though, he, initially, expressed, an, interest, in, his, rise, to, power, his, attitude, towards, hitler, turned, negative, at, the, point, when, mannerheim, s, visit, to, germany, made, him, realize, what, kind, of, ideal, state, hitler, was, building, he, compared, hitler, s, rise, in, germany, to, the, 1917, rise, of, the, bolshevists, in, russia, before, the, continuation, war, the, germans, offered, mannerheim, command, over, 80, 000, german, troops, in, finland, mannerheim, declined, so, as, to, not, tie, himself, and, finland, to, nazi, war, aims, mannerheim, was, ready, for, cooperation, and, fraternity, with, hitler, s, germany, but, for, practical, rather, than, ideological, reasons, because, of, the, soviet, threat, in, july, 1941, the, finnish, army, of, karelia, was, strengthened, by, the, german, 163rd, infantry, division, they, retook, the, finnish, territories, annexed, by, the, soviet, union, after, the, winter, war, and, went, further, occupying, east, karelia, finnish, troops, took, part, in, the, siege, of, leningrad, which, lasted, 872, days, on, 20, june, 1942, mannerheim, was, inspecting, finnish, front, line, troops, in, poventsa, when, he, and, his, staff, were, engaged, by, a, soviet, anti, tank, gun, with, direct, fire, one, shell, exploded, near, mannerheim, who, on, varying, accounts, took, cover, either, in, a, trench, or, behind, tree, trunks, until, finnish, counter, battery, fire, neutralized, the, attacker, captain, ahti, petramaa, section, commander, during, the, inspection, lost, fingers, from, flying, shrapnel, and, was, escorted, to, an, aid, station, where, he, was, promoted, to, major, by, mannerheim, mannerheim, s, 75th, birthday, 4, june, 1942, was, a, national, celebration, the, government, granted, him, the, unique, title, of, marshal, of, finland, suomen, marsalkka, in, finnish, marskalk, av, finland, in, swedish, so, far, he, is, the, only, person, to, receive, the, title, a, surprise, birthday, visit, by, hitler, occurred, on, the, day, as, he, wished, to, visit, the, brave, finns, die, tapferen, finnen, and, their, leader, mannerheim, mannerheim, did, not, want, to, meet, him, at, his, headquarters, or, in, helsinki, as, then, it, would, seem, like, an, official, state, visit, the, meeting, took, place, near, imatra, in, south, eastern, finland, and, was, arranged, in, secrecy, from, immola, airfield, hitler, accompanied, by, president, ryti, was, driven, to, where, baron, mannerheim, was, waiting, at, a, railway, siding, a, speech, from, hitler, was, followed, by, a, birthday, meal, and, negotiations, between, him, and, mannerheim, overall, hitler, spent, about, five, hours, in, finland, he, reportedly, asked, the, finns, to, step, up, military, operations, against, the, soviets, but, apparently, made, no, specific, demands, during, the, visit, an, engineer, of, the, finnish, broadcasting, company, yleisradio, thor, damen, succeeded, in, recording, the, first, eleven, minutes, of, hitler, s, and, mannerheim, s, private, conversation, this, had, to, be, done, secretly, as, hitler, never, allowed, off, guard, recordings, damen, was, assigned, to, record, the, official, birthday, speeches, and, mannerheim, s, response, and, therefore, placed, microphones, in, some, of, the, railway, cars, however, mannerheim, and, his, guests, chose, to, go, to, a, car, that, did, not, have, a, microphone, in, it, damen, acted, quickly, pushing, a, microphone, through, one, of, the, car, windows, onto, a, net, shelf, just, above, where, hitler, and, mannerheim, were, sitting, after, eleven, minutes, of, hitler, s, and, mannerheim, s, private, conversation, hitler, s, ss, bodyguards, spotted, the, cords, coming, out, of, the, window, and, realized, that, the, finnish, engineer, was, recording, the, conversation, they, gestured, to, him, to, stop, recording, immediately, and, he, complied, the, ss, bodyguards, demanded, that, the, tape, be, destroyed, but, yleisradio, was, allowed, to, keep, the, reel, after, promising, to, keep, it, in, a, sealed, container, it, was, given, to, kustaa, vilkuna, head, of, the, state, censors, office, and, in, 1957, returned, to, yleisradio, it, was, released, to, the, public, a, few, years, later, it, is, the, only, known, recording, of, hitler, speaking, outside, of, a, formal, occasion, there, is, an, unsubstantiated, story, that, while, conversing, with, hitler, mannerheim, lit, a, cigar, mannerheim, expected, that, hitler, would, ask, finland, for, more, help, against, the, soviet, union, which, mannerheim, was, unwilling, to, give, when, mannerheim, lit, up, all, in, attendance, gasped, for, hitler, s, aversion, to, smoking, was, well, known, nevertheless, hitler, continued, the, conversation, calmly, with, no, comment, by, this, test, mannerheim, could, judge, if, hitler, was, speaking, from, a, position, of, strength, or, weakness, he, refused, hitler, knowing, that, hitler, was, in, a, weak, position, and, could, not, dictate, to, him, shortly, thereafter, mannerheim, returned, the, visit, traveling, to, hitler, s, headquarters, in, east, prussia, in, june, 1944, baron, gustaf, mannerheim, to, ensure, german, support, while, a, major, soviet, offensive, was, threatening, finland, thought, that, it, was, necessary, to, agree, to, the, pact, the, german, foreign, minister, joachim, von, ribbentrop, demanded, but, even, then, mannerheim, distanced, himself, from, the, pact, and, it, fell, to, president, risto, ryti, to, sign, it, so, it, came, to, be, known, as, the, ryti, ribbentrop, agreement, this, allowed, mannerheim, to, revoke, the, agreement, upon, the, resignation, of, president, ryti, at, the, start, of, august, 1944, mannerheim, succeeded, ryti, as, president, when, germany, was, deemed, sufficiently, weakened, and, the, ussr, s, summer, offensive, was, fought, to, a, standstill, see, battle, of, tali, ihantala, thanks, to, the, june, agreement, with, the, germans, finland, s, leaders, saw, a, chance, to, reach, a, peace, with, the, soviet, union, at, first, attempts, were, made, to, persuade, mannerheim, to, become, prime, minister, but, he, rejected, them, because, of, his, age, and, lack, of, experience, running, a, civil, government, the, next, suggestion, was, to, elect, him, head, of, state, risto, ryti, would, resign, as, president, and, parliament, would, appoint, mannerheim, as, regent, the, use, of, the, title, regent, would, have, reflected, the, exceptional, circumstances, of, mannerheim, s, election, mannerheim, and, ryti, both, agreed, and, ryti, submitted, a, notice, of, resignation, on, 1, august, the, parliament, of, finland, passed, a, special, act, conferring, the, presidency, on, mannerheim, on, 4, august, 1944, he, took, the, oath, of, office, the, same, day, a, month, after, mannerheim, took, office, the, continuation, war, was, concluded, on, harsh, terms, but, ultimately, far, less, harsh, than, those, imposed, on, the, other, states, bordering, the, soviet, union, finland, retained, its, sovereignty, its, parliamentary, democracy, and, its, market, economy, territorial, losses, were, considerable, a, portion, of, karelia, and, all, petsamo, were, lost, numerous, karelian, refugees, needed, to, be, relocated, the, war, reparations, were, very, heavy, finland, also, had, to, fight, the, lapland, war, against, withdrawing, german, troops, in, the, north, and, at, the, same, time, demobilize, its, own, army, making, it, harder, to, expel, the, germans, mannerheim, appointed, lieutenant, general, hjalmar, siilasvuo, as, the, high, commander, of, the, army, to, take, this, action, it, is, widely, agreed, that, only, mannerheim, could, have, guided, finland, through, these, difficult, times, when, the, finnish, people, had, to, come, to, terms, with, the, severe, conditions, of, the, armistice, their, implementation, by, a, soviet, dominated, allied, control, commission, and, the, task, of, post, war, reconstruction, before, deciding, to, accept, the, soviet, demands, mannerheim, wrote, a, missive, directly, to, hitler, our, german, brothers, in, arms, will, forever, remain, in, our, hearts, the, germans, in, finland, were, certainly, not, the, representatives, of, foreign, despotism, but, helpers, and, brothers, in, arms, but, even, in, such, cases, foreigners, are, in, difficult, positions, requiring, such, tact, i, can, assure, you, that, during, the, past, years, nothing, whatsoever, happened, that, could, have, induced, us, to, consider, the, german, troops, intruders, or, oppressors, i, believe, that, the, attitude, of, the, german, army, in, northern, finland, towards, the, local, population, and, authorities, will, enter, our, history, as, a, unique, example, of, a, correct, and, cordial, relationship, i, deem, it, my, duty, to, lead, my, people, out, of, the, war, i, cannot, and, i, will, not, turn, the, arms, which, you, have, so, liberally, supplied, us, against, germans, i, harbour, the, hope, that, you, even, if, you, disapprove, of, my, attitude, will, wish, and, endeavour, like, myself, and, all, other, finns, to, terminate, our, former, relations, without, increasing, the, gravity, of, the, situation, mannerheim, s, term, as, president, was, difficult, for, him, although, he, was, elected, for, a, full, six, year, term, he, was, 77, years, old, in, 1944, and, had, accepted, the, office, reluctantly, after, being, urged, to, do, so, the, situation, was, exacerbated, by, frequent, periods, of, ill, health, the, demands, of, the, allied, control, commission, and, the, war, responsibility, trials, he, was, afraid, throughout, most, of, his, presidency, that, the, commission, would, request, that, he, be, prosecuted, for, crimes, against, peace, this, never, happened, one, of, the, reasons, for, this, was, stalin, s, respect, for, and, admiration, of, the, marshal, stalin, told, a, finnish, delegation, in, moscow, in, 1947, that, the, finns, owed, much, to, their, old, marshal, due, to, mannerheim, finland, was, not, occupied, despite, mannerheim, s, criticisms, of, some, of, the, demands, of, the, control, commission, he, worked, hard, to, carry, out, finland, s, armistice, obligations, he, also, emphasised, the, necessity, of, further, work, on, reconstruction, in, finland, after, the, war, mannerheim, was, troubled, by, recurring, health, problems, during, 1945, and, was, absent, on, medical, leave, from, his, duties, as, president, from, november, until, february, 1946, he, spent, six, weeks, in, portugal, to, restore, his, health, after, the, announcement, of, the, verdicts, in, the, war, crimes, trials, in, february, mannerheim, decided, to, resign, he, believed, that, he, had, accomplished, the, duties, he, had, been, elected, to, carry, out, the, war, was, ended, the, armistice, obligations, carried, out, and, war, responsibility, trials, finished, mannerheim, resigned, as, president, on, 4, march, 1946, giving, as, his, reason, his, declining, health, and, his, view, that, the, tasks, he, had, been, selected, to, carry, out, had, been, accomplished, he, was, succeeded, as, president, by, the, conservative, prime, minister, j, k, paasikivi, after, his, resignation, marshal, baron, mannerheim, bought, kirkniemi, manor, in, lohja, intending, to, spend, his, retirement, there, in, june, 1946, he, underwent, an, operation, for, a, perforated, peptic, ulcer, and, in, october, of, that, year, he, was, diagnosed, with, a, duodenal, ulcer, in, early, 1947, it, was, recommended, that, he, should, travel, to, the, valmont, sanatorium, in, montreux, switzerland, to, recuperate, and, write, his, memoirs, valmont, was, to, be, mannerheim, s, main, residence, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, although, he, regularly, returned, to, finland, and, also, visited, sweden, france, and, italy, because, mannerheim, was, old, and, sickly, he, personally, wrote, only, certain, passages, of, his, memoirs, some, other, parts, he, dictated, the, remaining, parts, were, written, from, his, recollections, by, mannerheim, s, various, assistants, such, as, colonel, alad, r, paasonen, general, erik, heinrichs, generals, grandell, olenius, and, martola, and, colonel, viljanen, a, war, historian, as, long, as, mannerheim, was, able, to, read, he, proofread, the, typewritten, drafts, of, his, memoirs, he, was, almost, totally, silent, about, his, private, life, and, focused, instead, on, finland, s, history, especially, between, 1917, and, 1944, when, mannerheim, suffered, a, fatal, bowel, obstruction, in, january, 1951, his, memoirs, were, not, yet, in, their, finished, form, they, were, published, after, his, death, mannerheim, died, on, 27, january, 1951, 28, january, finnish, time, in, the, cantonal, hospital, in, lausanne, french, l, h, pital, cantonal, lausanne, modern, lausanne, university, hospital, switzerland, he, was, buried, on, 4, february, 1951, in, the, hietaniemi, cemetery, in, helsinki, in, a, state, funeral, with, full, military, honours, today, mannerheim, retains, respect, as, finland, s, greatest, statesman, this, may, be, partly, due, to, his, refusal, to, enter, partisan, politics, although, his, sympathies, were, more, right, wing, than, left, wing, his, claim, always, to, serve, the, fatherland, without, selfish, motives, his, personal, courage, in, visiting, the, front, lines, his, ability, to, work, diligently, into, his, late, seventies, and, his, foreign, political, farsightedness, in, preparing, for, the, soviet, invasion, of, finland, years, before, it, occurred, although, finland, fought, alongside, nazi, germany, during, the, continuation, war, and, thus, in, co, operation, with, the, axis, powers, a, number, of, leaders, of, the, allies, still, respected, mannerheim, these, included, among, others, the, then, british, prime, minister, winston, churchill, at, a, 2017, conference, in, london, war, historian, terry, charman, said, it, was, difficult, for, churchill, to, declare, war, on, finland, at, stalin, s, demand, due, to, his, previous, uncomplicated, co, operation, with, mannerheim, which, led, churchill, and, mannerheim, to, exchange, polite, and, apologetic, correspondence, about, the, prevailing, circumstance, with, deep, respect, for, each, other, mannerheim, s, birthday, 4, june, is, celebrated, as, flag, day, by, the, finnish, defence, forces, this, decision, was, made, by, the, finnish, government, on, the, occasion, of, his, 75th, birthday, in, 1942, when, he, was, also, granted, the, title,
