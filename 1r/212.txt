gaius, valerius, catullus, classical, latin, c, 84, c, 54, bc, known, as, catullus, k, tul, s, was, a, latin, neoteric, poet, of, the, late, roman, republic, his, surviving, works, remain, widely, read, due, to, their, popularity, as, teaching, tools, and, because, of, their, personal, or, sexually, explicit, themes, g, ius, valerius, catullus, was, born, to, a, leading, equestrian, family, of, verona, in, cisalpine, gaul, the, social, prominence, of, the, catullus, family, allowed, the, father, of, gaius, valerius, to, entertain, julius, caesar, when, he, was, the, promagistrate, proconsul, of, both, gallic, provinces, in, a, poem, catullus, describes, his, happy, homecoming, to, the, family, villa, at, sirmio, on, lake, garda, near, verona, he, also, owned, a, villa, near, the, resort, of, tibur, modern, tivoli, catullus, appears, to, have, spent, most, of, his, young, adult, years, in, rome, his, friends, there, included, the, poets, licinius, calvus, and, helvius, cinna, quintus, hortensius, son, of, the, orator, and, rival, of, cicero, and, the, biographer, cornelius, nepos, to, whom, catullus, dedicated, a, libellus, of, poems, the, relation, of, which, to, the, extant, collection, remains, a, matter, of, debate, he, appears, to, have, been, acquainted, with, the, poet, marcus, furius, bibaculus, a, number, of, prominent, contemporaries, appear, in, his, poetry, including, cicero, caesar, and, pompey, according, to, an, anecdote, preserved, by, suetonius, caesar, did, not, deny, that, catullus, s, lampoons, left, an, indelible, stain, on, his, reputation, but, when, catullus, apologized, he, invited, the, poet, for, dinner, the, very, same, day, the, lesbia, of, his, poems, is, usually, identified, with, clodia, metelli, a, sophisticated, woman, from, the, aristocratic, house, of, patrician, family, claudii, pulchri, sister, of, the, infamous, publius, clodius, pulcher, and, wife, to, quintus, caecilius, metellus, celer, consul, of, 60, bc, in, his, poems, catullus, describes, several, stages, of, their, relationship, initial, euphoria, doubts, separation, and, his, wrenching, feelings, of, loss, clodia, had, several, other, partners, from, the, poems, one, can, adduce, no, fewer, than, five, lovers, in, addition, to, catullus, egnatius, poem, 37, gellius, poem, 91, quintius, poem, 82, rufus, poem, 77, and, lesbius, poem, 79, there, is, also, some, question, surrounding, her, husband, s, mysterious, death, in, 59, bc, in, his, speech, pro, caelio, cicero, hints, that, he, may, have, been, poisoned, however, a, sensitive, and, passionate, catullus, could, not, relinquish, his, flame, for, clodia, regardless, of, her, obvious, indifference, to, his, desire, for, a, deep, and, permanent, relationship, in, his, poems, catullus, wavers, between, devout, sweltering, love, and, bitter, scornful, insults, that, he, directs, at, her, blatant, infidelity, as, demonstrated, in, poems, 11, and, 58, his, passion, for, her, is, unrelenting, yet, it, is, unclear, when, exactly, the, couple, split, up, for, good, catullus, s, poems, about, the, relationship, display, striking, depth, and, psychological, insight, he, spent, the, year, from, summer, 57, to, summer, 56, bc, in, bithynia, on, the, staff, of, the, commander, gaius, memmius, while, in, the, east, he, traveled, to, the, troad, to, perform, rites, at, his, brother, s, tomb, an, event, recorded, in, a, moving, poem, 101, no, ancient, biography, of, catullus, has, survived, his, life, has, to, be, pieced, together, from, scattered, references, to, him, in, other, ancient, authors, and, from, his, poems, thus, it, is, uncertain, when, he, was, born, and, when, he, died, jerome, stated, that, he, was, born, in, 87, bc, and, died, in, rome, in, his, 30th, year, however, catullus, poems, include, references, to, events, of, 55, bc, since, the, roman, consular, fasti, make, it, somewhat, easy, to, confuse, 87, 57, bc, with, 84, 54, bc, many, scholars, accept, the, dates, 84, bc, 54, bc, supposing, that, his, latest, poems, and, the, publication, of, his, libellus, coincided, with, the, year, of, his, death, other, authors, suggest, 52, or, 51, bc, as, the, year, of, the, poet, s, death, though, upon, his, elder, brother, s, death, catullus, lamented, that, their, whole, house, was, buried, along, with, the, deceased, the, existence, and, prominence, of, valerii, catulli, is, attested, in, the, following, centuries, t, p, wiseman, argues, that, after, the, brother, s, death, catullus, could, have, married, and, that, in, this, case, the, later, valerii, catulli, may, have, been, his, descendants, catullus, s, poems, have, been, preserved, in, an, anthology, of, 116, carmina, the, actual, number, of, poems, may, slightly, vary, in, various, editions, which, can, be, divided, into, three, parts, according, to, their, form, approximately, sixty, short, poems, in, varying, meters, called, polymetra, nine, longer, poems, and, forty, eight, epigrams, in, elegiac, couplets, each, of, these, three, parts, approximately, 860, or, more, 1136, and, 330, lines, respectively, would, fit, onto, a, single, scroll, there, is, no, scholarly, consensus, on, whether, catullus, himself, arranged, the, order, of, the, poems, the, longer, poems, differ, from, the, polymetra, and, the, epigrams, not, only, in, length, but, also, in, their, subjects, several, of, them, are, based, on, the, theme, of, marriage, the, longest, 64, of, 408, lines, contains, two, myths, the, abandonment, of, ariadne, and, the, marriage, of, peleus, and, thetis, one, story, included, inside, the, other, the, polymetra, and, the, epigrams, can, be, divided, into, four, major, thematic, groups, ignoring, a, rather, large, number, of, poems, that, elude, such, categorization, above, all, other, qualities, catullus, seems, to, have, valued, venustas, or, charm, in, his, acquaintances, a, theme, which, he, explores, in, a, number, of, his, poems, catullus, s, poetry, was, influenced, by, the, innovative, poetry, of, the, hellenistic, age, and, especially, by, callimachus, and, the, alexandrian, school, which, had, propagated, a, new, style, of, poetry, that, deliberately, turned, away, from, the, classical, epic, poetry, in, the, tradition, of, homer, cicero, called, these, local, innovators, neoteroi, or, moderns, in, latin, poetae, novi, or, new, poets, in, that, they, cast, off, the, heroic, model, handed, down, from, ennius, in, order, to, strike, new, ground, and, ring, a, contemporary, note, catullus, and, callimachus, did, not, describe, the, feats, of, ancient, heroes, and, gods, except, perhaps, in, re, evaluating, and, predominantly, artistic, circumstances, e, g, poem, 64, focusing, instead, on, small, scale, personal, themes, although, these, poems, sometimes, seem, quite, superficial, and, their, subjects, often, are, mere, everyday, concerns, they, are, accomplished, works, of, art, catullus, described, his, work, as, expolitum, or, polished, to, show, that, the, language, he, used, was, very, carefully, and, artistically, composed, catullus, was, also, an, admirer, of, sappho, a, female, poet, of, the, seventh, century, bc, catullus, 51, partly, translates, partly, imitates, and, transforms, sappho, 31, some, hypothesize, that, 61, and, 62, were, perhaps, inspired, by, lost, works, of, sappho, but, this, is, purely, speculative, both, of, the, latter, are, epithalamia, a, form, of, laudatory, or, erotic, wedding, poetry, that, sappho, was, famous, for, catullus, twice, used, a, meter, that, sappho, was, known, for, called, the, sapphic, stanza, in, poems, 11, and, 51, perhaps, prompting, his, successor, horace, s, interest, in, the, form, catullus, as, was, common, to, his, era, was, greatly, influenced, by, stories, from, greek, and, roman, myth, his, longer, poems, such, as, 63, 64, 65, 66, and, 68, allude, to, mythology, in, various, ways, some, stories, he, refers, to, are, the, wedding, of, peleus, and, thetis, the, departure, of, the, argonauts, theseus, and, the, minotaur, ariadne, s, abandonment, tereus, and, procne, as, well, as, protesilaus, and, laodamia, catullus, wrote, in, many, different, meters, including, hendecasyllabic, verse, and, elegiac, couplets, common, in, love, poetry, a, great, part, of, his, poetry, shows, strong, and, occasionally, wild, emotions, especially, in, regard, to, lesbia, e, g, poems, 5, and, 7, his, love, poems, are, very, emotional, and, ardent, and, are, relatable, to, this, day, catullus, describes, his, lesbia, as, having, multiple, suitors, and, often, showing, little, affection, towards, him, he, also, demonstrates, a, great, sense, of, humour, such, as, in, catullus, 13, the, hungarian, born, british, composer, matyas, seiber, set, poem, 31, for, unaccompanied, mixed, chorus, sirmio, in, 1957, the, american, composer, ned, rorem, set, catullus, 101, to, music, for, voice, and, piano, the, song,
