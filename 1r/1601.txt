the, eastern, part, of, persia, greater, khorasan, and, central, asia, as, well, as, the, buyid, dynasty, in, the, western, part, of, persia, and, iraq, provided, a, thriving, atmosphere, for, scholarly, and, cultural, development, under, the, samanids, bukhara, rivaled, baghdad, for, cultural, capital, of, the, muslim, world, there, avicenna, had, access, to, the, great, libraries, of, balkh, khwarazm, gorgan, rey, isfahan, and, hamadan, various, texts, such, as, the, ahd, with, bahmanyar, show, that, avicenna, debated, philosophical, points, with, the, greatest, scholars, of, the, time, nizami, aruzi, described, how, before, ibn, sina, left, khwarazm, he, had, met, al, biruni, a, famous, scientist, and, astronomer, abu, nasr, mansur, a, renowned, mathematician, abu, sahl, isa,

transoxiana, to, a, persian, family, the, village, was, near, the, samanid, capital, of, bukhara, which, was, his, mother, s, hometown, his, father, abd, allah, was, a, native, of, the, city, of,

avicenna, was, educated, which, early, on, was, seemingly, administered, by, his, father, although, both, avicenna, s, father, and, brother, had, converted, to, isma, ilism, he, himself, did, not, follow, the, faith, he, was, instead, a, hanafi, sunni, the, same, school, followed, by, the, samanids, avicenna, was, first, schooled, in, the, quran, and, literature, and, by, the, age, of, 10, he, had, memorized, the, entire, quran, he, was, later, sent, by, his, father, to, an, indian, greengrocer, who, taught, him, arithmetic, afterwards, he, was, schooled, in, fiqh, by, the, hanafi, jurist,

died, 305, and, possibly, the, categories, of, aristotle, died, 322, bce, as, well, after, avicenna, had, read, the, almagest, of, ptolemy, died, 170, and, euclid, s, elements, al, natili, told, him, to, continue, his, research, independently, by, the, time, avicenna, was, eighteen, he, was, well, educated, in, greek, sciences, although, ibn, sina, only, mentions, al, natili, as, his, teacher, in, his, autobiography, he, most, likely, had, other, teachers, as, well, such, as, the, physicians, qumri, and, abu, sahl, isa, ibn, yahya, al, masihi, at, the, age, of, seventeen, avicenna, was, made, a, physician, of, nuh, ii, by, the, time, avicenna, was, at, least, 21, years, old, his, father, died, he, was, subsequently, given, an, administrative, post, possibly, succeeding, his, father, as, the, governor, of, harmaytan, avicenna, later, moved, to, gurganj, the, capital, of, khwarazm, which, he, reports, that, he, did, due, to, necessity, the, date, he, went, to, the, place, is, uncertain, as, he, reports, that, he, served, the, khwarazmshah, the, ruler, of, khwarazm, the, ma, munid, ruler, abu, al, hasan, ali, the, latter, ruled, from, 997, to, 1009, which, indicates, that, avicenna, moved, sometime, during, that, period, he, may, have, moved, in, 999, the, year, in, which, the, samanid, empire, fell, after, the, kara, khanid, khanate, captured, bukhara, and, imprisoned, the, samanid, emir, abd, al, malik, ii, due, to, his, high, position, and, strong, connection, with, the, samanids, ibn, sina, may, have, found, himself, in, an, unfavorable, position, after, the, fall, of, his, suzerain, it, was, through, the, minister, of, gurganj, abu, l, husayn, as, sahi, a, patron, of, greek, sciences, that, avicenna, entered, into, the, service, of, abu, al, hasan, ali, under, the, ma, munids, gurganj, became, a, centre, of, learning, attracting, many, prominent, figures, such, as, ibn, sina, and, his, former, teacher, abu, sahl, al, masihi, the, mathematician, abu, nasr, mansur, the, physician, ibn, al, khammar, and, the, philologist, al, tha, alibi, avicenna, later, moved, due, to, necessity, once, more, in, 1012, this, time, to, the, west, there, he, travelled, through, the, khurasani, cities, of, nasa, abivard, tus, samangan, and, jajarm, he, was, planning, to, visit, the, ruler, of, the, city, of, gorgan, the, ziyarid, qabus, r, 977, 981, 997, 1012, a, cultivated, patron, of, writing, whose, court, attracted, many, distinguished, poets, and, scholars, however, when, avicenna, eventually, arrived, he, discovered, that, the, ruler, had, been, dead, since, the, winter, of, 1013, avicenna, then, left, gorgan, for, dihistan, but, returned, after, becoming, ill, there, he, met, abu, ubayd, al, juzjani, died, 1070, who, became, his, pupil, and, companion, avicenna, stayed, briefly, in, gorgan, reportedly, serving, qabus, s, son, and, successor, manuchihr, r, 1012, 1031, and, resided, in, the, house, of, a, patron, in, c, 1014, avicenna, went, to, the, city, of, ray, where, he, entered, into, the, service, of, the, buyid, amir, majd, al, dawla, r, 997, 1029, and, his, mother, sayyida, shirin, the, de, facto, ruler, of, the, realm, there, he, served, as, the, physician, at, the, court, treating, majd, al, dawla, who, was, suffering, from, melancholia, avicenna, reportedly, later, served, as, the, business, manager, of, sayyida, shirin, in, qazvin, and, hamadan, though, details, regarding, this, tenure, are, unclear, during, this, period, avicenna, finished, writing, the, canon, of, medicine, and, started, writing, his, the, book, of, healing, in, 1015, during, avicenna, s, stay, in, hamadan, he, participated, in, a, public, debate, as, was, customary, for, newly, arrived, scholars, in, western, iran, at, that, time, the, purpose, of, the, debate, was, to, examine, one, s, reputation, against, a, prominent, resident, the, person, whom, avicenna, debated, against, was, abu, l, qasim, al, kirmani, a, member, of, the, school, of, philosophers, of, baghdad, the, debate, became, heated, resulting, in, ibn, sina, accusing, abu, l, qasim, of, lack, of, basic, knowledge, in, logic, while, abu, l, qasim, accused, ibn, sina, of, impoliteness, after, the, debate, avicenna, sent, a, letter, to, the, baghdad, peripatetics, asking, if, abu, l, qasim, s, claim, that, he, shared, the, same, opinion, as, them, was, true, abu, l, qasim, later, retaliated, by, writing, a, letter, to, an, unknown, person, in, which, he, made, accusations, so, serious, that, ibn, sina, wrote, to, abu, sa, d, the, deputy, of, majd, al, dawla, to, investigate, the, matter, the, accusation, made, towards, avicenna, may, have, been, the, same, as, he, had, received, earlier, in, which, he, was, accused, by, the, people, of, hamadan, of, copying, the, stylistic, structures, of, the, quran, in, his, sermons, on, divine, unity, the, seriousness, of, this, charge, in, the, words, of, the, historian, peter, adamson, cannot, be, underestimated, in, the, larger, muslim, culture, not, long, afterwards, avicenna, shifted, his, allegiance, to, the, rising, buyid, amir, shams, al, dawla, the, younger, brother, of, majd, al, dawla, which, adamson, suggests, was, due, to, abu, l, qasim, also, working, under, sayyida, shirin, avicenna, had, been, called, upon, by, shams, al, dawla, to, treat, him, but, after, the, latter, s, campaign, in, the, same, year, against, his, former, ally, the, annazid, ruler, abu, shawk, r, 1010, 1046, he, forced, avicenna, to, become, his, vizier, although, avicenna, would, sometimes, clash, with, shams, al, dawla, s, troops, he, remained, vizier, until, the, latter, died, of, colic, in, 1021, avicenna, was, asked, to, stay, as, vizier, by, shams, al, dawla, s, son, and, successor, sama, al, dawla, r, 1021, 1023, but, he, instead, went, into, hiding, with, his, patron, abu, ghalib, al, attar, to, wait, for, better, opportunities, to, emerge, it, was, during, this, period, that, avicenna, was, secretly, in, contact, with, ala, al, dawla, muhammad, r, 1008, 1041, the, kakuyid, ruler, of, isfahan, and, uncle, of, sayyida, shirin, it, was, during, his, stay, at, attar, s, home, that, avicenna, completed, the, book, of, healing, writing, 50, pages, a, day, the, buyid, court, in, hamadan, particularly, the, kurdish, vizier, taj, al, mulk, suspected, avicenna, of, correspondence, with, ala, al, dawla, and, as, a, result, had, the, house, of, attar, ransacked, and, ibn, sina, imprisoned, in, the, fortress, of, fardajan, outside, hamadan, juzjani, blames, one, of, ibn, sina, s, informers, for, his, capture, he, was, imprisoned, for, four, months, until, ala, al, dawla, captured, hamadan, ending, sama, al, dawla, s, reign, avicenna, was, subsequently, released, and, went, to, isfahan, where, he, was, well, received, by, ala, al, dawla, in, the, words, of, juzjani, the, kakuyid, ruler, gave, avicenna, the, respect, and, esteem, which, someone, like, him, deserved, adamson, also, says, that, avicenna, s, service, under, ala, al, dawla, proved, to, be, the, most, stable, period, of, his, life, avicenna, served, as, the, advisor, if, not, vizier, of, ala, al, dawla, accompanying, him, in, many, of, his, military, expeditions, and, travels, avicenna, dedicated, two, persian, works, to, him, a, philosophical, treatise, named, danish, nama, yi, ala, i, book, of, science, for, ala, and, a, medical, treatise, about, the, pulse, during, the, brief, occupation, of, isfahan, by, the, ghaznavids, in, january, 1030, avicenna, and, ala, al, dawla, relocated, to, the, southwestern, iranian, region, of, khuzistan, where, they, stayed, until, the, death, of, the, ghaznavid, ruler, mahmud, r, 998, 1030, which, occurred, two, months, later, it, was, seemingly, when, avicenna, returned, to, isfahan, that, he, started, writing, his, pointers, and, reminders, in, 1037, while, avicenna, was, accompanying, ala, al, dawla, to, a, battle, near, isfahan, he, contracted, a, severe, colic, which, he, had, been, suffering, from, throughout, his, life, he, died, shortly, afterwards, in, hamadan, where, he, was, buried, avicenna, wrote, extensively, on, early, islamic, philosophy, especially, the, subjects, logic, ethics, and, metaphysics, including, treatises, named, logic, and, metaphysics, most, of, his, works, were, written, in, arabic, then, the, language, of, science, in, the, muslim, world, and, some, in, early, new, persian, of, linguistic, significance, even, to, this, day, are, a, few, books, that, he, wrote, in, persian, particularly, the, danishnama, avicenna, s, commentaries, on, aristotle, often, criticized, the, philosopher, encouraging, a, lively, debate, in, the, spirit, of, ijtihad, avicenna, s, neoplatonic, scheme, of, emanations, became, fundamental, in, kalam, in, the, 12th, century, the, book, of, healing, became, available, in, europe, in, a, partial, latin, translation, some, fifty, years, after, its, composition, under, the, title, sufficientia, and, some, authors, have, identified, a, latin, avicennism, as, flourishing, for, some, time, paralleling, the, more, influential, latin, averroism, but, it, was, suppressed, by, the, parisian, decrees, of, 1210, and, 1215, avicenna, s, psychology, and, theory, of, knowledge, influenced, the, theologian, william, of, auvergne, and, albertus, magnus, while, his, metaphysics, influenced, the, thought, of, thomas, aquinas, early, islamic, philosophy, and, islamic, metaphysics, imbued, as, it, is, with, kalam, distinguishes, between, essence, and, existence, more, clearly, than, aristotelianism, whereas, existence, is, the, domain, of, the, contingent, and, the, accidental, essence, endures, within, a, being, beyond, the, accidental, the, philosophy, of, avicenna, particularly, that, part, relating, to, metaphysics, owes, much, to, al, farabi, the, search, for, a, definitive, islamic, philosophy, separate, from, occasionalism, can, be, seen, in, what, is, left, of, his, work, following, al, farabi, s, lead, avicenna, initiated, a, full, fledged, inquiry, into, the, question, of, being, in, which, he, distinguished, between, essence, arabic, romanized, m, hiya, and, existence, arabic, romanized, wuj, d, he, argued, that, the, fact, of, existence, cannot, be, inferred, from, or, accounted, for, by, the, essence, of, existing, things, and, that, form, and, matter, by, themselves, cannot, interact, and, originate, the, movement, of, the, universe, or, the, progressive, actualization, of, existing, things, existence, must, therefore, be, due, to, an, agent, cause, that, necessitates, imparts, gives, or, adds, existence, to, an, essence, to, do, so, the, cause, must, be, an, existing, thing, and, coexist, with, its, effect, avicenna, s, consideration, of, the, essence, attributes, question, may, be, elucidated, in, terms, of, his, ontological, analysis, of, the, modalities, of, being, namely, impossibility, contingency, and, necessity, avicenna, argued, that, the, impossible, being, is, that, which, cannot, exist, while, the, contingent, in, itself, mumkin, bi, dhatihi, has, the, potentiality, to, be, or, not, to, be, without, entailing, a, contradiction, when, actualized, the, contingent, becomes, a, necessary, existent, due, to, what, is, other, than, itself, wajib, al, wujud, bi, ghayrihi, thus, contingency, in, itself, is, potential, beingness, that, could, eventually, be, actualized, by, an, external, cause, other, than, itself, the, metaphysical, structures, of, necessity, and, contingency, are, different, necessary, being, due, to, itself, wajib, al, wujud, bi, dhatihi, is, true, in, itself, while, the, contingent, being, is, false, in, itself, and, true, due, to, something, else, other, than, itself, the, necessary, is, the, source, of, its, own, being, without, borrowed, existence, it, is, what, always, exists, the, necessary, exists, due, to, its, self, and, has, no, quiddity, essence, other, than, existence, furthermore, it, is, one, wahid, ahad, since, there, cannot, be, more, than, one, necessary, existent, due, to, itself, without, differentia, fasl, to, distinguish, them, from, each, other, yet, to, require, differentia, entails, that, they, exist, due, to, themselves, as, well, as, due, to, what, is, other, than, themselves, and, this, is, contradictory, if, no, differentia, distinguishes, them, from, each, other, then, in, no, sense, are, these, existents, not, the, same, avicenna, adds, that, the, necessary, existent, due, to, itself, has, no, genus, jins, nor, a, definition, hadd, nor, a, counterpart, nadd, nor, an, opposite, did, and, is, detached, bari, from, matter, madda, quality, kayf, quantity, kam, place, ayn, situation, wad, and, time, waqt, avicenna, s, theology, on, metaphysical, issues, il, hiyy, t, has, been, criticized, by, some, islamic, scholars, among, them, al, ghazali, ibn, taymiyya, and, ibn, qayyim, al, jawziyya, while, discussing, the, views, of, the, theists, among, the, greek, philosophers, namely, socrates, plato, and, aristotle, in, al, munqidh, min, ad, dalal, deliverance, from, error, al, ghazali, noted, must, be, taxed, with, unbelief, as, must, their, partisans, among, the, muslim, philosophers, such, as, avicenna, and, al, farabi, and, their, likes, none, however, of, the, muslim, philosophers, engaged, so, much, in, transmitting, aristotle, s, lore, as, did, the, two, men, just, mentioned, the, sum, of, what, we, regard, as, the, authentic, philosophy, of, aristotle, as, transmitted, by, al, farabi, and, avicenna, can, be, reduced, to, three, parts, a, part, which, must, be, branded, as, unbelief, a, part, which, must, be, stigmatized, as, innovation, and, a, part, which, need, not, be, repudiated, at, all, avicenna, made, an, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, which, would, be, known, as, the, proof, of, the, truthful, wajib, al, wujud, avicenna, argued, that, there, must, be, a, proof, of, the, truthful, an, entity, that, cannot, not, exist, and, through, a, series, of, arguments, he, identified, it, with, god, in, islam, present, day, historian, of, philosophy, peter, adamson, called, this, argument, one, of, the, most, influential, medieval, arguments, for, god, s, existence, and, avicenna, s, biggest, contribution, to, the, history, of, philosophy, correspondence, between, ibn, sina, with, his, student, ahmad, ibn, ali, al, ma, sumi, and, al, biruni, has, survived, in, which, they, debated, aristotelian, natural, philosophy, and, the, peripatetic, school, al, biruni, began, by, asking, eighteen, questions, ten, of, which, were, criticisms, of, aristotle, s, on, the, heavens, ibn, sina, was, a, devout, muslim, and, sought, to, reconcile, rational, philosophy, with, islamic, theology, he, aimed, to, prove, the, existence, of, god, and, his, creation, of, the, world, scientifically, and, through, reason, and, logic, his, views, on, islamic, theology, and, philosophy, were, enormously, influential, forming, part, of, the, core, of, the, curriculum, at, islamic, religious, schools, until, the, 19th, century, avicenna, wrote, several, short, treatises, dealing, with, islamic, theology, these, included, treatises, on, the, prophets, and, messengers, in, islam, whom, he, viewed, as, inspired, philosophers, and, also, on, various, scientific, and, philosophical, interpretations, of, the, quran, such, as, how, quranic, cosmology, corresponds, to, his, philosophical, system, in, general, these, treatises, linked, his, philosophical, writings, to, islamic, religious, ideas, for, example, the, body, s, afterlife, there, are, occasional, brief, hints, and, allusions, in, his, longer, works, however, that, avicenna, considered, philosophy, as, the, only, sensible, way, to, distinguish, real, prophecy, from, illusion, he, did, not, state, this, more, clearly, because, of, the, political, implications, of, such, a, theory, if, prophecy, could, be, questioned, and, also, because, most, of, the, time, he, was, writing, shorter, works, which, concentrated, on, explaining, his, theories, on, philosophy, and, theology, clearly, without, digressing, to, consider, epistemological, matters, which, could, only, be, properly, considered, by, other, philosophers, later, interpretations, of, avicenna, s, philosophy, split, into, three, different, schools, those, such, as, al, tusi, who, continued, to, apply, his, philosophy, as, a, system, to, interpret, later, political, events, and, scientific, advances, those, such, as, al, razi, who, considered, avicenna, s, theological, works, in, isolation, from, his, wider, philosophical, concerns, and, those, such, as, al, ghazali, who, selectively, used, parts, of, his, philosophy, to, support, their, own, attempts, to, gain, greater, spiritual, insights, through, a, variety, of, mystical, means, it, was, the, theological, interpretation, championed, by, those, such, as, al, razi, which, eventually, came, to, predominate, in, the, madrasahs, avicenna, memorized, the, quran, by, the, age, of, ten, and, as, an, adult, wrote, five, treatises, commenting, on, surahs, of, the, quran, one, of, these, texts, included, the, proof, of, prophecies, in, which, he, comments, on, several, quranic, verses, and, holds, the, quran, in, high, esteem, avicenna, argued, that, the, islamic, prophets, should, be, considered, higher, than, philosophers, avicenna, is, generally, understood, to, have, been, aligned, with, the, hanafi, school, of, sunni, thought, avicenna, studied, hanafi, law, many, of, his, notable, teachers, were, hanafi, jurists, and, he, served, under, the, hanafi, court, of, ali, ibn, mamun, avicenna, said, at, an, early, age, that, he, remained, unconvinced, by, ismaili, missionary, attempts, to, convert, him, medieval, historian, ah, r, al, d, n, al, bayhaq, d, 1169, believed, avicenna, to, be, a, follower, of, the, brethren, of, purity, while, he, was, imprisoned, in, the, castle, of, fardajan, near, hamadhan, avicenna, wrote, his, famous, floating, man, literally, falling, man, a, thought, experiment, to, demonstrate, human, self, awareness, and, the, substantiality, and, immateriality, of, the, soul, avicenna, believed, his, floating, man, thought, experiment, demonstrated, that, the, soul, is, a, substance, and, claimed, humans, cannot, doubt, their, own, consciousness, even, in, a, situation, that, prevents, all, sensory, data, input, the, thought, experiment, told, its, readers, to, imagine, themselves, created, all, at, once, while, suspended, in, the, air, isolated, from, all, sensations, which, includes, no, sensory, contact, with, even, their, own, bodies, he, argued, that, in, this, scenario, one, would, still, have, self, consciousness, because, it, is, conceivable, that, a, person, suspended, in, air, while, cut, off, from, sense, experience, would, still, be, capable, of, determining, his, own, existence, the, thought, experiment, points, to, the, conclusions, that, the, soul, is, a, perfection, independent, of, the, body, and, an, immaterial, substance, the, conceivability, of, this, floating, man, indicates, that, the, soul, is, perceived, intellectually, which, entails, the, soul, s, separateness, from, the, body, avicenna, referred, to, the, living, human, intelligence, particularly, the, active, intellect, which, he, believed, to, be, the, hypostasis, by, which, god, communicates, truth, to, the, human, mind, and, imparts, order, and, intelligibility, to, nature, following, is, an, english, translation, of, the, argument, one, of, us, i, e, a, human, being, should, be, imagined, as, having, been, created, in, a, single, stroke, created, perfect, and, complete, but, with, his, vision, obscured, so, that, he, cannot, perceive, external, entities, created, falling, through, air, or, a, void, in, such, a, manner, that, he, is, not, struck, by, the, firmness, of, the, air, in, any, way, that, compels, him, to, feel, it, and, with, his, limbs, separated, so, that, they, do, not, come, in, contact, with, or, touch, each, other, then, contemplate, the, following, can, he, be, assured, of, the, existence, of, himself, he, does, not, have, any, doubt, in, that, his, self, exists, without, thereby, asserting, that, he, has, any, exterior, limbs, nor, any, internal, organs, neither, heart, nor, brain, nor, any, one, of, the, exterior, things, at, all, but, rather, he, can, affirm, the, existence, of, himself, without, thereby, asserting, there, that, this, self, has, any, extension, in, space, even, if, it, were, possible, for, him, in, that, state, to, imagine, a, hand, or, any, other, limb, he, would, not, imagine, it, as, being, a, part, of, his, self, nor, as, a, condition, for, the, existence, of, that, self, for, as, you, know, that, which, is, asserted, is, different, from, that, which, is, not, asserted, and, that, which, is, inferred, is, different, from, that, which, is, not, inferred, therefore, the, self, the, existence, of, which, has, been, asserted, is, a, unique, characteristic, in, as, much, that, it, is, not, as, such, the, same, as, the, body, or, the, limbs, which, have, not, been, ascertained, thus, that, which, is, ascertained, i, e, the, self, does, have, a, way, of, being, sure, of, the, existence, of, the, soul, as, something, other, than, the, body, even, something, non, bodily, this, he, knows, this, he, should, understand, intuitively, if, it, is, that, he, is, ignorant, of, it, and, needs, to, be, beaten, with, a, stick, however, avicenna, posited, the, brain, as, the, place, where, reason, interacts, with, sensation, sensation, prepares, the, soul, to, receive, rational, concepts, from, the, universal, agent, intellect, the, first, knowledge, of, the, flying, person, would, be, i, am, affirming, his, or, her, essence, that, essence, could, not, be, the, body, obviously, as, the, flying, person, has, no, sensation, thus, the, knowledge, that, i, am, is, the, core, of, a, human, being, the, soul, exists, and, is, self, aware, avicenna, thus, concluded, that, the, idea, of, the, self, is, not, logically, dependent, on, any, physical, thing, and, that, the, soul, should, not, be, seen, in, relative, terms, but, as, a, primary, given, a, substance, the, body, is, unnecessary, in, relation, to, it, the, soul, is, its, perfection, in, itself, the, soul, is, an, immaterial, substance, avicenna, authored, a, five, volume, medical, encyclopedia, the, canon, of, medicine, arabic, romanized, al, q, n, n, f, l, ibb, it, was, used, as, the, standard, medical, textbook, in, the, islamic, world, and, europe, up, to, the, 18th, century, the, canon, still, plays, an, important, role, in, unani, medicine, avicenna, considered, whether, events, like, rare, diseases, or, disorders, have, natural, causes, he, used, the, example, of, polydactyly, to, explain, his, perception, that, causal, reasons, exist, for, all, medical, events, this, view, of, medical, phenomena, anticipated, developments, in, the, enlightenment, by, seven, centuries, avicenna, wrote, on, earth, sciences, such, as, geology, in, the, book, of, healing, while, discussing, the, formation, of, mountains, he, explained, either, they, are, the, effects, of, upheavals, of, the, crust, of, the, earth, such, as, might, occur, during, a, violent, earthquake, or, they, are, the, effect, of, water, which, cutting, itself, a, new, route, has, denuded, the, valleys, the, strata, being, of, different, kinds, some, soft, some, hard, it, would, require, a, long, period, of, time, for, all, such, changes, to, be, accomplished, during, which, the, mountains, themselves, might, be, somewhat, diminished, in, size, in, the, al, burhan, on, demonstration, section, of, the, book, of, healing, avicenna, discussed, the, philosophy, of, science, and, described, an, early, scientific, method, of, inquiry, he, discussed, aristotle, s, posterior, analytics, and, significantly, diverged, from, it, on, several, points, avicenna, discussed, the, issue, of, a, proper, methodology, for, scientific, inquiry, and, the, question, of, how, does, one, acquire, the, first, principles, of, a, science, he, asked, how, a, scientist, would, arrive, at, the, initial, axioms, or, hypotheses, of, a, deductive, science, without, inferring, them, from, some, more, basic, premises, he, explained, that, the, ideal, situation, is, when, one, grasps, that, a, relation, holds, between, the, terms, which, would, allow, for, absolute, universal, certainty, avicenna, then, added, two, further, methods, for, arriving, at, the, first, principles, the, ancient, aristotelian, method, of, induction, istiqra, and, the, method, of, examination, and, experimentation, tajriba, avicenna, criticized, aristotelian, induction, arguing, that, it, does, not, lead, to, the, absolute, universal, and, certain, premises, that, it, purports, to, provide, in, its, place, he, developed, a, method, of, experimentation, as, a, means, for, scientific, inquiry, an, early, formal, system, of, temporal, logic, was, studied, by, avicenna, although, he, did, not, develop, a, real, theory, of, temporal, propositions, he, did, study, the, relationship, between, temporalis, and, the, implication, avicenna, s, work, was, further, developed, by, najm, al, d, n, al, qazw, n, al, k, tib, and, became, the, dominant, system, of, islamic, logic, until, modern, times, avicennian, logic, also, influenced, several, early, european, logicians, such, as, albertus, magnus, and, william, of, ockham, avicenna, endorsed, the, law, of, non, contradiction, proposed, by, aristotle, that, a, fact, could, not, be, both, true, and, false, at, the, same, time, and, in, the, same, sense, of, the, terminology, used, he, stated, anyone, who, denies, the, law, of, non, contradiction, should, be, beaten, and, burned, until, he, admits, that, to, be, beaten, is, not, the, same, as, not, to, be, beaten, and, to, be, burned, is, not, the, same, as, not, to, be, burned, in, mechanics, avicenna, in, the, book, of, healing, developed, a, theory, of, motion, in, which, he, made, a, distinction, between, the, inclination, tendency, to, motion, and, force, of, a, projectile, and, concluded, that, motion, was, a, result, of, an, inclination, mayl, transferred, to, the, projectile, by, the, thrower, and, that, projectile, motion, in, a, vacuum, would, not, cease, he, viewed, inclination, as, a, permanent, force, whose, effect, is, dissipated, by, external, forces, such, as, air, resistance, the, theory, of, motion, presented, by, avicenna, was, probably, influenced, by, the, 6th, century, alexandrian, scholar, john, philoponus, avicenna, s, is, a, less, sophisticated, variant, of, the, theory, of, impetus, developed, by, buridan, in, the, 14th, century, it, is, unclear, if, buridan, was, influenced, by, avicenna, or, by, philoponus, directly, in, optics, avicenna, was, among, those, who, argued, that, light, had, a, speed, observing, that, if, the, perception, of, light, is, due, to, the, emission, of, some, sort, of, particles, by, a, luminous, source, the, speed, of, light, must, be, finite, he, also, provided, a, wrong, explanation, of, the, rainbow, phenomenon, carl, benjamin, boyer, described, avicenna, s, ibn, s, n, theory, on, the, rainbow, as, follows, independent, observation, had, demonstrated, to, him, that, the, bow, is, not, formed, in, the, dark, cloud, but, rather, in, the, very, thin, mist, lying, between, the, cloud, and, the, sun, or, observer, the, cloud, he, thought, serves, as, the, background, of, this, thin, substance, much, as, a, quicksilver, lining, is, placed, upon, the, rear, surface, of, the, glass, in, a, mirror, ibn, s, n, would, change, the, place, not, only, of, the, bow, but, also, of, the, color, formation, holding, the, iridescence, to, be, merely, a, subjective, sensation, in, the, eye, in, 1253, a, latin, text, entitled, speculum, tripartitum, stated, the, following, regarding, avicenna, s, theory, on, heat, avicenna, says, in, his, book, of, heaven, and, earth, that, heat, is, generated, from, motion, in, external, things, avicenna, s, legacy, in, classical, psychology, is, primarily, embodied, in, the, kitab, al, nafs, parts, of, his, kitab, al, shifa, the, book, of, healing, and, kitab, al, najat, the, book, of, deliverance, these, were, known, in, latin, under, the, title, de, anima, treatises, on, the, soul, notably, avicenna, develops, what, is, called, the, flying, man, argument, in, the, psychology, of, the, cure, i, 1, 7, as, defence, of, the, argument, that, the, soul, is, without, quantitative, extension, which, has, an, affinity, with, descartes, s, cogito, argument, or, what, phenomenology, designates, as, a, form, of, an, epoche, avicenna, s, psychology, requires, that, connection, between, the, body, and, soul, be, strong, enough, to, ensure, the, soul, s, individuation, but, weak, enough, to, allow, for, its, immortality, avicenna, grounds, his, psychology, on, physiology, which, means, his, account, of, the, soul, is, one, that, deals, almost, entirely, with, the, natural, science, of, the, body, and, its, abilities, of, perception, thus, the, philosopher, s, connection, between, the, soul, and, body, is, explained, almost, entirely, by, his, understanding, of, perception, in, this, way, bodily, perception, interrelates, with, the, immaterial, human, intellect, in, sense, perception, the, perceiver, senses, the, form, of, the, object, first, by, perceiving, features, of, the, object, by, our, external, senses, this, sensory, information, is, supplied, to, the, internal, senses, which, merge, all, the, pieces, into, a, whole, unified, conscious, experience, this, process, of, perception, and, abstraction, is, the, nexus, of, the, soul, and, body, for, the, material, body, may, only, perceive, material, objects, while, the, immaterial, soul, may, only, receive, the, immaterial, universal, forms, the, way, the, soul, and, body, interact, in, the, final, abstraction, of, the, universal, from, the, concrete, particular, is, the, key, to, their, relationship, and, interaction, which, takes, place, in, the, physical, body, the, soul, completes, the, action, of, intellection, by, accepting, forms, that, have, been, abstracted, from, matter, this, process, requires, a, concrete, particular, material, to, be, abstracted, into, the, universal, intelligible, immaterial, the, material, and, immaterial, interact, through, the, active, intellect, which, is, a, divine, light, containing, the, intelligible, forms, the, active, intellect, reveals, the, universals, concealed, in, material, objects, much, like, the, sun, makes, colour, available, to, our, eyes, avicenna, wrote, an, attack, on, astrology, titled, missive, on, the, champions, of, the, rule, of, the, stars, in, which, he, cited, passages, from, the, quran, to, dispute, the, power, of, astrology, to, foretell, the, future, he, believed, that, each, classical, planet, had, some, influence, on, the, earth, but, argued, against, current, astrological, practices, avicenna, s, astronomical, writings, had, some, influence, on, later, writers, although, in, general, his, work, could, be, considered, less, developed, than, that, of, ibn, al, haytham, or, al, biruni, one, important, feature, of, his, writing, is, that, he, considers, mathematical, astronomy, a, separate, discipline, from, astrology, he, criticized, aristotle, s, view, of, the, stars, receiving, their, light, from, the, sun, stating, that, the, stars, are, self, luminous, and, believed, that, the, planets, are, also, self, luminous, he, claimed, to, have, observed, the, transit, of, venus, this, is, possible, as, there, was, a, transit, on, 24, may, 1032, but, ibn, sina, did, not, give, the, date, of, his, observation, and, modern, scholars, have, questioned, whether, he, could, have, observed, the, transit, from, his, location, at, that, time, he, may, have, mistaken, a, sunspot, for, venus, he, used, his, transit, observation, to, help, establish, that, venus, was, at, least, sometimes, below, the, sun, in, the, geocentric, model, i, e, the, sphere, of, venus, comes, before, the, sphere, of, the, sun, when, moving, out, from, the, earth, he, also, wrote, the, summary, of, the, almagest, based, on, ptolemy, s, almagest, with, an, appended, treatise, to, bring, that, which, is, stated, in, the, almagest, and, what, is, understood, from, natural, science, into, conformity, for, example, ibn, sina, considers, the, motion, of, the, solar, apsis, which, ptolemy, had, taken, to, be, fixed, avicenna, was, first, to, derive, the, attar, of, flowers, from, distillation, and, used, steam, distillation, to, produce, essential, oils, such, as, rose, essence, which, he, used, as, aromatherapeutic, treatments, for, heart, conditions, unlike, al, razi, avicenna, explicitly, disputed, the, theory, of, the, transmutation, of, substances, commonly, believed, by, alchemists, those, of, the, chemical, craft, know, well, that, no, change, can, be, effected, in, the, different, species, of, substances, though, they, can, produce, the, appearance, of, such, change, four, works, on, alchemy, attributed, to, avicenna, were, translated, into, latin, as, liber, aboali, abincine, de, anima, in, arte, alchemiae, was, the, most, influential, having, influenced, later, medieval, chemists, and, alchemists, such, as, vincent, of, beauvais, however, anawati, argues, following, ruska, that, the, de, anima, is, a, fake, by, a, spanish, author, similarly, the, declaratio, is, believed, not, to, be, actually, by, avicenna, the, third, work, the, book, of, minerals, is, agreed, to, be, avicenna, s, writing, adapted, from, the, kitab, al, shifa, book, of, the, remedy, avicenna, classified, minerals, into, stones, fusible, substances, sulfurs, and, salts, building, on, the, ideas, of, aristotle, and, jabir, the, epistola, de, re, recta, is, somewhat, less, sceptical, of, alchemy, anawati, argues, that, it, is, by, avicenna, but, written, earlier, in, his, career, when, he, had, not, yet, firmly, decided, that, transmutation, was, impossible, almost, half, of, avicenna, s, works, are, versified, his, poems, appear, in, both, arabic, and, persian, as, an, example, edward, granville, browne, claims, that, the, following, persian, verses, are, incorrectly, attributed, to, omar, khayy, m, and, were, originally, written, by, ibn, s, n, from, the, depth, of, the, black, earth, up, to, saturn, s, apogee, all, the, problems, of, the, universe, have, been, solved, by, me, i, have, escaped, from, the, coils, of, snares, and, deceits, i, have, unraveled, all, knots, except, the, knot, of, death, 91, robert, wisnovsky, a, scholar, of, avicenna, attached, to, mcgill, university, says, that, avicenna, was, the, central, figure, in, the, long, history, of, the, rational, sciences, in, islam, particularly, in, the, fields, of, metaphysics, logic, and, medicine, but, that, his, works, didn, t, only, have, an, influence, in, these, secular, fields, of, knowledge, alone, as, these, works, or, portions, of, them, were, read, taught, copied, commented, upon, quoted, paraphrased, and, cited, by, thousands, of, post, avicennian, scholars, not, only, philosophers, logicians, physicians, and, specialists, in, the, mathematical, or, exact, sciences, but, also, by, those, who, specialized, in, the, disciplines, of, ilm, al, kal, m, rational, theology, but, understood, to, include, natural, philosophy, epistemology, and, philosophy, of, mind, and, us, l, al, fiqh, jurisprudence, but, understood, to, include, philosophy, of, law, dialectic, and, philosophy, of, language, as, early, as, the, 14th, century, when, dante, alighieri, depicted, him, in, limbo, alongside, the, virtuous, non, christian, thinkers, in, his, divine, comedy, such, as, virgil, averroes, homer, horace, ovid, lucan, socrates, plato, and, saladin, avicenna, has, been, recognized, by, both, east, and, west, as, one, of, the, great, figures, in, intellectual, history, johannes, kepler, cites, avicenna, s, opinion, when, discussing, the, causes, of, planetary, motions, in, chapter, 2, of, astronomia, nova, george, sarton, the, author, of, the, history, of, science, described, avicenna, as, one, of, the, greatest, thinkers, and, medical, scholars, in, history, and, called, him, the, most, famous, scientist, of, islam, and, one, of, the, most, famous, of, all, races, places, and, times, he, was, one, of, the, islamic, world, s, leading, writers, in, the, field, of, medicine, along, with, rhazes, abulcasis, ibn, al, nafis, and, al, ibadi, avicenna, is, considered, an, important, compiler, of, early, muslim, medicine, he, is, remembered, in, the, western, history, of, medicine, as, a, major, historical, figure, who, made, important, contributions, to, medicine, and, the, european, renaissance, his, medical, texts, were, unusual, in, that, where, controversy, existed, between, galen, and, aristotle, s, views, on, medical, matters, such, as, anatomy, he, preferred, to, side, with, aristotle, where, necessary, updating, aristotle, s, position, to, take, into, account, post, aristotelian, advances, in, anatomical, knowledge, aristotle, s, dominant, intellectual, influence, among, medieval, european, scholars, meant, that, avicenna, s, linking, of, galen, s, medical, writings, with, aristotle, s, philosophical, writings, in, the, canon, of, medicine, along, with, its, comprehensive, and, logical, organisation, of, knowledge, significantly, increased, avicenna, s, importance, in, medieval, europe, in, comparison, to, other, islamic, writers, on, medicine, his, influence, following, translation, of, the, canon, was, such, that, from, the, early, fourteenth, to, the, mid, sixteenth, centuries, he, was, ranked, with, hippocrates, and, galen, as, one, of, the, acknowledged, authorities, princeps, medicorum, prince, of, physicians, institutions, in, a, variety, of, counties, have, been, named, after, avicenna, in, honour, of, his, scientific, accomplishments, including, the, avicenna, mausoleum, and, museum, bu, ali, sina, university, avicenna, research, institute, and, ibn, sina, academy, of, medieval, medicine, and, sciences, there, is,
