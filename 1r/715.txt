and, an, explorer, in, africa, livingstone, was, married, to, mary, moffat, livingstone, from, the, prominent, 18th, century, moffat, missionary, family, livingstone, came, to, have, a, mythic, status, that, operated, on, a, number, of, interconnected, levels, protestant, missionary, martyr, working, class, rags, to, riches, inspirational, story, scientific, investigator, and, explorer, imperial, reformer, anti, slavery, crusader, and, advocate, of, british, commercial, and, colonial, expansion, as, a, result, livingstone, became, one, of, the, most, popular, british, heroes, of, the, late, 19th, century, victorian, era, livingstone, s, fame, as, an, explorer, and, his, obsession, with, learning, the, sources, of, the, nile, river, was, founded, on, the, belief, that, if, he, could, solve, that, age, old, mystery, his, fame, would, give, him, the, influence, to, end, the, east, african, arab, swahili, slave, trade, the, nile, sources, he, told, a, friend, are, valuable, only, as, a, means, of, opening, my, mouth, with, power, among, men, it, is, this, power, which, i, hope, to, remedy, an, immense, evil, his, subsequent, exploration, of, the, central, african, watershed, was, the, culmination, of, the, classic, period, of, european, geographical, discovery, and, colonial, penetration, of, africa, at, the, same, time, his, missionary, travels, disappearance, and, eventual, death, in, africa, and, subsequent, glorification, as, a, posthumous, national, hero, in, 1874, led, to, the, founding, of, several, major, central, african, christian, missionary, initiatives, carried, forward, in, the, era, of, the, european, scramble, for, africa, livingstone, was, born, on, 19, march, 1813, in, the, mill, town, of, blantyre, scotland, in, a, tenement, building, for, the, workers, of, a, cotton, factory, on, the, banks, of, the, river, clyde, under, the, bridge, crossing, into, bothwell, he, was, the, second, of, seven, children, born, to, neil, livingstone, 1788, 1856, and, his, wife, agnes, n, e, hunter, 1782, 1865, david, was, employed, at, the, age, of, ten, in, the, cotton, mill, of, henry, monteith, co, in, blantyre, works, he, and, his, brother, john, worked, twelve, hour, days, as, piecers, tying, broken, cotton, threads, on, the, spinning, machines, neil, livingstone, was, a, sunday, school, teacher, and, teetotaller, who, handed, out, christian, tracts, on, his, travels, as, a, door, to, door, tea, salesman, he, read, books, on, theology, travel, and, missionary, enterprises, extensively, this, rubbed, off, on, the, young, david, who, became, an, avid, reader, but, he, also, loved, scouring, the, countryside, for, animal, plant, and, geological, specimens, in, local, limestone, quarries, neil, feared, that, science, books, were, undermining, christianity, and, attempted, to, force, his, son, to, read, nothing, but, theology, but, david, s, deep, interest, in, nature, and, science, led, him, to, investigate, the, relationship, between, religion, and, science, in, 1832, he, read, philosophy, of, a, future, state, written, by, thomas, dick, and, he, found, the, rationale, that, he, needed, to, reconcile, faith, and, science, and, apart, from, the, bible, this, book, was, perhaps, his, greatest, philosophical, influence, other, significant, influences, in, his, early, life, were, thomas, burke, a, blantyre, evangelist, and, david, hogg, his, sunday, school, teacher, at, age, fifteen, david, left, the, church, of, scotland, for, a, local, congregational, church, influenced, by, preachers, like, ralph, wardlaw, who, denied, predestinarian, limitations, on, salvation, influenced, by, revivalistic, teachings, in, the, united, states, livingstone, entirely, accepted, the, proposition, put, by, charles, finney, professor, of, theology, at, oberlin, college, ohio, that, the, holy, spirit, is, open, to, all, who, ask, it, for, livingstone, this, meant, a, release, from, the, fear, of, eternal, damnation, livingstone, s, reading, of, missionary, karl, g, tzlaff, s, appeal, to, the, churches, of, britain, and, america, on, behalf, of, china, enabled, him, to, persuade, his, father, that, medical, study, could, advance, religious, ends, livingstone, s, experiences, in, h, monteith, s, blantyre, cotton, mill, were, also, important, from, ages, 10, to, 26, first, as, a, piecer, and, later, as, a, spinner, this, monotonous, work, was, necessary, to, support, his, impoverished, family, but, it, taught, him, persistence, endurance, and, a, natural, empathy, with, all, who, labour, as, expressed, by, lines, that, he, used, to, hum, from, the, egalitarian, robert, burns, song, when, man, to, man, the, world, o, er, shall, brothers, be, for, a, that, livingstone, attended, blantyre, village, school, along, with, the, few, other, mill, children, with, the, endurance, to, do, so, despite, their, 14, hour, workday, 6, am, 8, pm, having, a, family, with, a, strong, continuing, commitment, to, study, reinforced, his, education, at, the, age, of, 21, he, was, excited, by, a, pamphlet, his, father, got, from, the, church, setting, out, g, tzlaff, s, call, for, missionaries, to, china, with, the, new, concept, that, missionaries, should, be, trained, as, medical, doctors, his, father, was, persuaded, and, like, many, other, students, in, scotland, livingstone, was, to, support, himself, with, the, agreement, of, the, mill, management, by, working, at, his, old, job, from, easter, to, october, outwith, term, time, he, joined, anderson, s, university, glasgow, in, 1836, studying, medicine, and, chemistry, as, well, as, attending, theology, lectures, by, the, anti, slavery, campaigner, richard, wardlaw, at, the, congregational, church, college, where, he, may, also, have, studied, greek, to, enter, medical, school, he, needed, some, knowledge, of, latin, and, was, tutored, by, a, local, roman, catholic, man, daniel, gallagher, later, a, priest, founder, of, st, simon, s, partick, livingstone, worked, hard, got, a, good, grounding, in, science, and, medicine, and, made, lifelong, friends, including, andrew, buchanan, and, james, young, the, london, missionary, society, lms, was, at, the, time, the, major, organisation, in, the, country, for, missionary, work, and, unlike, others, was, open, to, congregationalists, he, applied, to, the, lms, in, october, 1837, and, in, january, was, sent, questions, which, he, answered, he, got, no, reply, until, invited, to, two, interviews, in, august, 1838, he, was, then, accepted, as, a, probationary, candidate, and, given, initial, training, at, ongar, essex, as, the, introduction, to, studies, to, become, a, minister, within, the, congregational, union, serving, under, the, lms, rather, than, the, more, basic, course, for, an, artisan, missionary, at, ongar, he, and, six, other, students, had, tuition, in, greek, latin, hebrew, and, theology, from, the, reverend, richard, cecil, who, in, january, 1839, assessed, that, despite, heaviness, of, manner, and, rusticity, livingstone, had, sense, and, quiet, vigour, good, temper, and, substantial, character, so, i, do, not, like, the, thought, of, him, being, rejected, a, month, later, he, still, thought, livingstone, hardly, ready, to, go, on, to, theological, studies, at, cheshunt, college, and, worthy, but, remote, from, brilliant, in, june, 1839, the, lms, directors, accepted, livingstone, and, agreed, to, his, request, to, continue, studying, with, cecil, at, ongar, until, the, end, of, the, year, then, have, lms, support, for, medical, studies, in, london, to, gain, necessary, clinical, training, he, continued, his, medical, studies, at, the, charing, cross, hospital, medical, school, with, his, courses, covering, medical, practice, midwifery, and, botany, he, qualified, as, a, licentiate, of, the, faculty, now, royal, college, of, physicians, and, surgeons, of, glasgow, on, 16, november, 1840, in, 1857, he, was, made, an, honorary, fellow, of, the, faculty, on, 20, november, 1840, livingstone, was, ordained, a, minister, of, the, church, as, was, another, missionary, to, south, africa, william, ross, in, a, service, at, the, albion, chapel, finsbury, the, ordination, service, was, conducted, by, cecil, and, j, j, freeman, though, livingstone, had, responded, to, g, tzlaff, s, call, for, missionaries, to, china, the, looming, first, opium, war, made, the, lms, directors, cautious, about, sending, recruits, there, when, he, asked, to, extend, his, probationary, training, at, ongar, cecil, told, him, of, their, wish, that, he, should, be, employed, in, the, west, indies, in, preference, to, south, africa, on, 2, july, 1839, he, wrote, to, the, lms, directors, that, the, west, indies, was, by, then, well, served, by, doctors, and, he, had, always, been, attracted, to, other, parts, of, the, world, rather, than, a, settled, pastorate, with, lms, agreement, he, continued, to, get, theological, tuition, from, cecil, until, the, end, of, the, year, then, resumed, medical, studies, on, beginning, his, clinical, training, in, january, 1840, he, returned, to, mrs, sewell, s, missionary, boarding, house, in, aldersgate, where, he, had, stayed, previously, when, in, london, others, staying, there, were, visited, occasionally, by, the, missionary, robert, moffat, who, was, then, in, england, with, his, family, to, publicise, the, work, of, his, lms, mission, at, kuruman, in, south, africa, livingstone, questioned, him, repeatedly, about, africa, and, as, moffat, later, recalled, by, and, by, he, asked, me, whether, i, thought, he, would, do, for, africa, i, said, i, believed, he, would, if, he, would, not, go, to, an, old, station, but, would, advance, to, unoccupied, ground, specifying, the, vast, plain, to, the, north, where, i, had, sometimes, seen, in, the, morning, sun, the, smoke, of, a, thousand, villages, where, no, missionary, had, ever, been, he, was, excited, by, moffat, s, vision, of, expanding, missionary, work, to, the, north, of, bechuanaland, and, by, the, hotly, debated, topic, of, christianity, and, commerce, the, lms, missionary, john, philip, after, discussion, with, the, abolitionist, fowell, buxton, published, researches, in, south, africa, in, 1828, proposing, that, christianity, would, always, bring, civilisation, including, free, trade, and, free, labour, this, argument, was, reinforced, for, livingstone, when, he, attended, the, exeter, hall, meeting, of, 1, june, 1840, where, buxton, powerfully, made, the, case, that, the, african, slave, trade, would, be, ended, if, chiefs, instead, of, having, to, sell, slaves, could, obtain, desired, european, goods, through, legitimate, trade, its, effect, augmented, by, christian, missions, preaching, the, gospel, and, introducing, school, education, livingstone, left, london, on, 17, november, 1840, passenger, on, a, sailing, brig, bound, for, the, cape, of, good, hope, along, with, two, other, lms, missionaries, ross, who, had, been, ordained, at, the, same, service, as, him, and, ross, s, wife, during, the, long, voyage, he, studied, dutch, and, tswana, language, and, the, captain, gave, him, extensive, tuition, in, navigation, at, rio, de, janeiro, unlike, the, other, two, he, ventured, ashore, and, was, impressed, by, the, cathedral, and, scenery, but, not, by, drunkenness, of, british, and, american, sailors, so, he, gave, them, tracts, in, a, dockside, bar, on, 15, march, 1841, the, ship, arrived, at, simon, s, bay, and, for, a, month, while, it, unloaded, and, loaded, the, three, stayed, at, cape, town, with, mr, and, mrs, philip, as, resident, director, of, the, lms, philip, had, continued, their, policy, that, all, people, were, equal, before, god, and, in, law, leading, to, disputes, with, boers, and, with, british, settlers, as, philip, held, that, xhosa, people, were, not, to, blame, for, the, xhosa, wars, over, extending, the, cape, colony, missionary, factions, disagreed, over, this, and, over, his, emphasis, on, missionary, work, among, griqua, people, of, the, colony, while, others, like, moffatt, wanted, more, focus, on, new, areas, there, were, also, tensions, between, artisan, missionaries, engaged, for, lay, expertise, and, ordained, missionaries, the, ship, took, livingstone, and, the, rosses, on, to, algoa, bay, from, 19, may, to, 31, july, they, were, on, the, long, trek, by, ox, cart, to, the, kuruman, mission, the, moffats, had, not, yet, returned, from, britain, and, he, immersed, himself, in, tswana, life, from, september, to, late, december, he, trekked, 750, miles, 1, 210, km, with, the, artisan, missionary, roger, edwards, who, had, been, at, kuruman, since, 1830, and, had, been, told, by, moffat, to, investigate, potential, for, a, new, station, they, visited, and, discussed, the, area, called, mabotsa, botswana, near, zeerust, north, west, province, south, africa, in, 1842, livingstone, went, on, two, treks, with, african, companions, the, principals, were, mission, members, paul, and, mebalwe, a, deacon, in, june, 1843, edwards, got, lms, approval, to, set, up, a, mission, station, with, his, wife, at, mabotsa, livingstone, moved, there, by, agreement, and, joined, them, in, the, physical, work, of, building, facilities, he, wrote, to, tell, lms, secretary, arthur, tidman, saying, he, would, be, delighted, to, call, mabotsa, the, centre, of, the, sphere, of, my, labours, but, would, try, to, hold, himself, in, readiness, to, go, anywhere, provided, it, be, forward, the, moffats, accompanied, by, two, new, missionary, families, reached, the, vaal, river, in, january, 1844, livingstone, rode, out, to, meet, them, there, then, sat, in, the, moffats, ox, cart, talking, with, robert, for, hours, during, the, seventeen, or, eighteen, days, it, took, to, get, home, to, kuruman, for, the, first, time, he, met, their, daughter, mary, who, had, been, born, and, brought, up, in, africa, lions, often, attacked, herds, of, the, mabotsa, villagers, on, 16, february, mebalwe, and, livingstone, joined, them, defending, sheep, livingstone, got, a, clear, shot, at, a, large, lion, but, while, he, was, re, loading, it, attacked, crushing, his, left, arm, and, forced, him, to, the, ground, his, life, was, saved, by, mebalwe, diverting, its, attention, by, trying, to, shoot, the, lion, he, too, got, bitten, a, man, who, tried, spearing, it, was, attacked, just, before, it, dropped, dead, livingstone, s, broken, bone, even, though, inexpertly, set, by, himself, and, edwards, bonded, strongly, he, went, for, recuperation, to, kuruman, where, he, was, tended, by, moffat, s, daughter, mary, and, they, became, engaged, his, arm, healed, enabling, him, to, shoot, and, lift, heavy, weights, though, it, remained, a, source, of, much, suffering, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, he, was, not, able, to, lift, the, arm, higher, than, his, shoulder, livingstone, and, mary, were, married, on, 9, january, 1845, livingstone, was, obliged, to, leave, his, first, mission, at, mabotsa, in, botswana, in, 1845, after, irreconcilable, differences, emerged, between, him, and, his, fellow, missionary, rogers, edwards, and, because, the, bakgatla, were, proving, indifferent, to, the, gospel, he, abandoned, chonuane, his, next, mission, in, 1847, because, of, drought, and, the, proximity, of, the, boers, and, his, desire, to, move, on, to, the, regions, beyond, at, kolobeng, mission, livingstone, converted, chief, sechele, in, 1849, after, two, years, of, patient, persuasion, only, a, few, months, later, sechele, lapsed, to, improve, his, tswana, language, skills, and, find, locations, to, set, up, mission, stations, livingstone, made, journeys, far, to, the, north, of, kolobeng, with, william, cotton, oswell, in, 1849, they, crossed, the, kalahari, desert, and, reached, lake, ngami, in, 1850, he, was, recognised, by, the, royal, geographical, society, which, presented, him, a, chronometer, watch, for, his, journey, to, the, great, lake, of, ngami, he, heard, of, a, river, which, could, potentially, become, a, highway, to, the, coast, and, in, august, 1851, they, reached, the, zambezi, which, he, hoped, would, be, a, key, to, the, interior, in, 1852, after, sending, his, family, to, britain, livingstone, travelled, north, to, the, village, of, linyanti, on, the, zambezi, river, located, roughly, midway, between, the, east, and, west, coast, of, the, continent, where, sekeletu, chief, of, the, kololo, granted, livingstone, authority, as, a, nduna, to, lead, a, joint, investigation, of, trade, routes, to, the, coast, with, 27, kololo, warriors, acting, as, interpreters, and, guides, they, reached, the, portuguese, city, of, luanda, on, the, atlantic, in, may, 1854, after, profound, difficulties, and, the, near, death, of, livingstone, from, fever, livingstone, realized, the, route, would, be, too, difficult, for, future, traders, so, he, retraced, the, journey, back, to, linyanti, then, with, 114, kololo, men, loaned, by, the, same, chief, he, set, off, east, down, the, zambezi, on, this, leg, he, became, the, first, european, to, see, the, mosi, oa, tunya, the, smoke, that, thunders, waterfall, which, he, named, victoria, falls, after, queen, victoria, eventually, he, successfully, reached, quelimane, on, the, indian, ocean, having, mapped, most, of, the, course, of, the, zambezi, river, for, this, livingstone, became, famous, as, the, first, european, to, cross, south, central, africa, at, that, latitude, and, was, hailed, as, having, opened, up, africa, but, there, was, already, a, long, established, trans, regional, network, of, trade, routes, portuguese, traders, had, penetrated, to, the, middle, of, the, continent, from, both, sides, in, 1853, 1854, two, arab, traders, crossed, the, continent, from, zanzibar, to, benguela, around, 1800, two, native, traders, crossed, from, angola, to, mozambique, livingstone, advocated, the, establishment, of, trade, and, religious, missions, in, central, africa, but, abolition, of, the, african, slave, trade, as, carried, out, by, the, portuguese, of, tete, and, the, arab, swahili, of, kilwa, became, his, primary, goal, his, motto, now, inscribed, on, his, statue, at, victoria, falls, was, christianity, commerce, and, civilization, a, combination, that, he, hoped, would, form, an, alternative, to, the, slave, trade, and, impart, dignity, to, the, africans, in, the, eyes, of, europeans, he, believed, that, the, key, to, achieving, these, goals, was, the, navigation, of, the, zambezi, river, as, a, christian, commercial, highway, into, the, interior, he, returned, to, britain, in, december, 1856, the, royal, geographical, society, awarded, him, their, patron, s, medal, in, 1855, for, his, explorations, in, africa, encouraged, by, the, london, missionary, society, he, wrote, up, his, journal, but, unconventionally, had, his, missionary, travels, published, in, 1857, by, john, murray, making, it, a, bestselling, travelogue, the, book, included, his, field, science, and, exceptionally, sympathetic, descriptions, of, african, people, he, proposed, that, missions, and, legitimate, commerce, by, river, into, central, africa, would, end, slave, trading, livingstone, was, encouraged, by, the, response, in, britain, to, his, discoveries, and, support, for, future, expeditions, he, proposed, to, do, more, exploration, primarily, to, find, routes, for, commercial, trade, which, he, believed, would, displace, slave, trade, routes, more, so, than, for, solely, missionary, work, the, london, missionary, society, lms, on, learning, of, his, plans, sent, a, letter, which, livingstone, received, at, quelimane, congratulating, him, on, his, journey, but, said, that, the, directors, were, restricted, in, their, power, of, aiding, plans, connected, only, remotely, with, the, spread, of, the, gospel, this, brusque, rejection, for, new, mission, stations, north, of, the, zambezi, and, his, wider, object, of, opening, the, interior, for, trade, via, the, zambezi, was, not, enough, to, make, him, resign, from, the, lms, at, once, when, roderick, murchison, president, of, the, royal, geographical, society, put, him, in, touch, with, the, foreign, secretary, livingstone, said, nothing, to, the, lms, directors, even, when, his, leadership, of, a, government, expedition, to, the, zambezi, seemed, increasingly, likely, to, be, funded, by, the, exchequer, i, am, not, yet, fairly, on, with, the, government, he, told, a, friend, but, am, nearly, quite, off, with, the, society, lms, livingstone, resigned, from, the, london, missionary, society, in, 1857, and, in, may, of, that, year, he, was, appointed, as, her, majesty, s, consul, with, a, roving, commission, extending, through, mozambique, to, the, areas, west, of, it, in, february, 1858, his, area, of, jurisdiction, was, stipulated, to, be, the, eastern, coast, of, africa, and, the, independent, districts, in, the, interior, while, he, negotiated, with, the, government, for, his, new, position, as, consul, the, lms, thought, that, he, would, return, to, africa, with, their, mission, to, the, kololo, in, barotseland, which, livingstone, had, promoted, that, mission, eventually, suffered, deaths, from, malaria, of, a, missionary, his, wife, a, second, missionary, s, wife, and, three, children, livingstone, had, suffered, over, thirty, attacks, during, his, previous, journey, but, had, understated, his, suffering, and, overstated, the, quality, of, the, land, they, would, find, and, the, missionaries, set, out, for, the, marshy, region, with, wholly, inadequate, supplies, of, quinine, biographer, tim, jeal, considered, this, episode, a, major, failing, for, livingstone, and, indicative, of, a, pattern, of, putting, his, goals, and, career, above, the, lives, of, those, around, him, livingstone, was, now, a, celebrity, in, great, demand, as, a, public, speaker, and, was, elected, to, the, royal, society, he, gained, public, backing, for, his, plans, and, raised, finances, for, his, next, expedition, by, public, subscription, as, well, as, 5, 000, from, the, government, to, investigate, the, potential, for, british, trade, via, the, zambezi, in, december, 1857, the, foreign, office, proposed, a, huge, expedition, livingstone, had, envisaged, another, solo, journey, with, african, helpers, in, january, 1858, he, agreed, to, lead, a, second, zambezi, expedition, with, six, specialist, officers, hurriedly, recruited, in, the, uk, the, prefabricated, iron, river, steamer, ma, robert, was, quickly, built, in, portable, sections, and, loaded, onto, the, colonial, office, steamer, pearl, which, took, them, out, on, its, way, to, ceylon, they, left, on, 10, march, at, freetown, collected, twelve, kru, seafarers, to, man, the, river, steamer, and, reached, the, zambezi, on, 14, may, the, plan, was, for, both, ships, to, take, them, up, the, river, to, establish, bases, but, it, turned, out, to, be, completely, impassable, to, boats, past, the, cahora, bassa, rapids, a, series, of, cataracts, and, rapids, that, livingstone, had, failed, to, explore, on, his, earlier, travels, pearl, offloaded, their, supplies, on, an, island, about, 40, miles, 64, km, upstream, from, there, ma, robert, had, to, make, repeated, slow, journeys, getting, hauled, across, shoals, the, riverbanks, were, a, war, zone, with, portuguese, soldiers, and, their, slaves, fighting, the, chikunda, slave, hunters, of, matakenya, mariano, but, both, sides, accepted, the, expedition, as, friends, the, experts, stuck, at, shupanga, could, not, make, the, intended, progress, and, there, were, disagreements, artist, thomas, baines, was, dismissed, from, the, expedition, others, on, the, expedition, became, the, first, to, reach, lake, nyasa, and, they, explored, it, in, a, four, oared, gig, in, 1861, the, colonial, office, provided, a, new, wooden, paddle, survey, vessel, pioneer, which, took, the, universities, mission, to, central, africa, umca, led, by, bishop, charles, mackenzie, up, the, shire, river, to, found, a, new, mission, livingstone, raised, funds, for, a, replacement, river, steamer, lady, nyasa, specially, designed, to, sail, on, lake, nyasa, it, was, shipped, out, in, sections, contrary, to, his, request, with, a, mission, party, including, mary, livingstone, and, arrived, in, 1862, the, pioneer, was, delayed, getting, down, to, the, coast, to, meet, them, and, there, were, further, delays, after, it, was, found, that, the, bishop, had, died, mary, livingstone, died, on, 27, april, 1862, from, malaria, livingstone, took, pioneer, up, the, coast, and, investigated, the, ruvuma, river, the, physician, john, kirk, wrote, i, can, come, to, no, other, conclusion, than, that, dr, livingstone, is, out, of, his, mind, and, a, most, unsafe, leader, when, pioneer, returned, to, shupanga, in, december, 1862, they, paid, in, cloth, their, mazaro, men, who, left, and, engaged, replacements, on, 10, january, 1863, they, set, off, towing, lady, nyasa, and, went, up, the, shire, river, past, scenes, of, devastation, as, mariano, s, chikunda, slave, hunts, caused, famine, and, they, frequently, had, to, clear, the, paddle, wheels, of, corpses, left, floating, downstream, they, reached, chibisa, s, and, the, murchison, cataracts, in, april, then, began, dismantling, lady, nyasa, and, building, a, road, to, take, its, sections, past, the, cataracts, while, explorations, continued, he, brought, the, ships, downriver, in, 1864, after, the, government, ordered, the, recall, of, the, expedition, the, zambezi, expedition, was, castigated, as, a, failure, in, many, newspapers, of, the, time, and, livingstone, experienced, great, difficulty, in, raising, funds, to, further, explore, africa, john, kirk, charles, meller, and, richard, thornton, scientists, appointed, to, work, under, livingstone, contributed, large, collections, of, botanical, ecological, geological, and, ethnographic, material, to, scientific, institutions, in, the, united, kingdom, in, january, 1866, livingstone, returned, to, africa, this, time, to, zanzibar, and, from, there, he, set, out, to, seek, the, source, of, the, nile, richard, francis, burton, john, hanning, speke, and, samuel, baker, had, identified, either, lake, albert, or, lake, victoria, as, the, source, which, was, partially, correct, as, the, nile, bubbles, from, the, ground, high, in, the, mountains, of, burundi, halfway, between, lake, tanganyika, and, lake, victoria, but, there, was, still, serious, debate, on, the, matter, livingstone, believed, that, the, source, was, farther, south, and, assembled, a, team, to, find, it, consisting, of, freed, slaves, comoros, islanders, twelve, sepoys, and, two, servants, from, his, previous, expedition, chuma, and, susi, livingstone, set, out, from, the, mouth, of, the, ruvuma, river, but, his, assistants, gradually, began, deserting, him, the, comoros, islanders, had, returned, to, zanzibar, and, falsely, informed, authorities, that, livingstone, had, died, he, reached, lake, malawi, on, 6, august, by, which, time, most, of, his, supplies, had, been, stolen, including, all, his, medicines, livingstone, then, travelled, through, swamps, in, the, direction, of, lake, tanganyika, with, his, health, declining, he, sent, a, message, to, zanzibar, requesting, that, supplies, be, sent, to, ujiji, and, he, then, headed, west, forced, by, ill, health, to, travel, with, slave, traders, he, arrived, at, lake, mweru, on, 8, november, 1867, and, continued, on, travelling, south, to, become, the, first, european, to, see, lake, bangweulu, upon, finding, the, lualaba, river, livingstone, theorised, that, it, could, have, been, the, high, part, of, the, nile, river, but, realised, that, it, in, fact, flowed, into, the, river, congo, at, upper, congo, lake, the, year, 1869, began, with, livingstone, finding, himself, extremely, ill, while, in, the, jungle, he, was, saved, by, arab, traders, who, gave, him, medicines, and, carried, him, to, an, arab, outpost, in, march, 1869, livingstone, suffered, from, pneumonia, and, arrived, in, ujiji, to, find, his, supplies, stolen, he, was, coming, down, with, cholera, and, had, tropical, ulcers, on, his, feet, so, he, was, again, forced, to, rely, on, slave, traders, to, get, him, as, far, as, bambara, where, he, was, caught, by, the, wet, season, with, no, supplies, livingstone, had, to, eat, his, meals, in, a, roped, off, enclosure, for, the, entertainment, of, the, locals, in, return, for, food, on, 15, july, 1871, livingstone, recorded, in, his, field, diary, his, immediate, impressions, as, he, witnessed, around, 400, africans, being, massacred, by, arab, slavers, at, the, nyangwe, market, on, the, banks, of, the, lualaba, river, while, he, was, watching, next, to, the, leading, arab, trader, dugumbe, who, had, given, him, assistance, the, cause, behind, this, attack, is, stated, to, be, retaliation, for, actions, of, manilla, the, head, slave, who, had, sacked, villages, of, mohombo, people, at, the, instigation, of, the, wagenya, chieftain, kimburu, the, arabs, attacked, the, shoppers, and, kimburu, s, people, researchers, from, the, indiana, university, of, pennsylvania, who, scanned, livingstone, s, diary, suggest, that, in, putting, his, fragmentary, notes, about, the, massacre, into, the, narrative, of, his, journal, he, left, out, his, concerns, about, some, of, his, followers, slaves, owned, by, banyan, merchants, who, had, been, hired, by, john, kirk, acting, consul, at, zanzibar, and, sent, to, get, livingstone, to, safety, these, slaves, had, been, liberated, and, added, to, his, party, but, had, shown, violent, conduct, against, local, people, contrary, to, his, instructions, and, he, feared, they, might, have, been, involved, in, starting, the, massacre, his, diary, noted, dugumbe, s, men, murdering, kimburu, and, another, for, slaves, and, implied, that, the, slave, manilla, played, a, leading, part, but, looking, back, at, the, events, he, says, dugumb, s, people, bore, responsibility, and, started, it, to, make, an, example, of, manilla, in, the, diary, he, described, his, sending, his, men, with, protection, of, a, flag, to, assist, manilla, s, brother, in, his, journal, version, it, was, to, assist, villagers, the, version, edited, by, waller, in, the, last, journals, published, in, 1874, left, out, the, context, of, livingstone, s, earlier, comments, about, kirk, and, bad, behaviour, of, the, hired, banyan, men, and, omitted, the, villagers, earlier, violent, resistance, to, arab, slavers, so, it, portrayed, the, villagers, as, passive, victims, the, section, on, the, massacre, itself, had, only, minor, grammatical, corrections, further, research, into, diary, notes, continues, the, massacre, horrified, livingstone, leaving, him, too, shattered, to, continue, his, mission, to, find, the, source, of, the, nile, following, the, end, of, the, wet, season, he, travelled, 240, miles, 390, km, from, nyangwe, back, to, ujiji, an, arab, settlement, on, the, eastern, shore, of, lake, tanganyika, violently, ill, most, of, the, way, arriving, on, 23, october, 1871, livingstone, was, wrong, about, the, nile, but, he, identified, numerous, geographical, features, for, western, science, such, as, lake, ngami, lake, malawi, and, lake, bangweulu, in, addition, to, victoria, falls, mentioned, above, he, filled, in, details, of, lake, tanganyika, lake, mweru, and, the, course, of, many, rivers, especially, the, upper, zambezi, and, his, observations, enabled, large, regions, to, be, mapped, which, previously, had, been, blank, even, so, the, farthest, north, he, reached, was, the, north, end, of, lake, tanganyika, still, south, of, the, equator, and, he, did, not, penetrate, the, rainforest, of, the, river, congo, any, farther, downstream, than, ntangwe, near, misisi, livingstone, was, awarded, the, gold, medal, of, the, royal, geographical, society, of, london, and, was, made, a, fellow, of, the, society, with, which, he, had, a, strong, association, for, the, rest, of, his, life, livingstone, completely, lost, contact, with, the, outside, world, for, six, years, and, was, ill, for, most, of, the, last, four, years, of, his, life, only, one, of, his, 44, letter, dispatches, made, it, to, zanzibar, one, surviving, letter, to, horace, waller, was, made, available, to, the, public, in, 2010, by, its, owner, peter, beard, it, reads, i, am, terribly, knocked, up, but, this, is, for, your, own, eye, only, doubtful, if, i, live, to, see, you, again, henry, morton, stanley, had, been, sent, to, find, him, by, the, new, york, herald, newspaper, in, 1869, he, found, livingstone, in, the, town, of, ujiji, on, the, shores, of, lake, tanganyika, on, 10, november, 1871, apparently, greeting, him, with, the, now, famous, words, dr, livingstone, i, presume, livingstone, responded, yes, and, then, i, feel, thankful, that, i, am, here, to, welcome, you, these, famous, words, may, have, been, a, fabrication, as, stanley, later, tore, out, the, pages, of, this, encounter, in, his, diary, even, livingstone, s, account, of, this, encounter, does, not, mention, these, words, however, the, phrase, appears, in, a, new, york, herald, editorial, dated, 10, august, 1872, and, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, and, the, oxford, dictionary, of, national, biography, both, quote, it, without, questioning, its, veracity, the, words, are, famous, because, of, their, perceived, humour, livingstone, being, the, only, other, white, person, for, hundreds, of, miles, along, with, stanley, s, clumsy, attempt, at, appearing, dignified, in, the, bush, of, africa, by, making, a, formal, greeting, one, might, expect, to, hear, in, the, confines, of, an, upper, class, london, club, however, readers, of, the, herald, immediately, saw, through, stanley, s, pretensions, as, noted, by, his, biographer, tim, jeal, stanley, struggled, his, whole, life, with, a, self, perceived, weakness, of, being, from, a, humble, background, and, manufactured, events, to, make, up, for, this, supposed, deficiency, stanley, s, book, suggests, that, this, greeting, was, truly, motivated, by, embarrassment, because, he, did, not, dare, to, embrace, livingstone, despite, stanley, s, urgings, livingstone, was, determined, not, to, leave, africa, until, his, mission, was, complete, his, illness, made, him, confused, and, he, had, judgment, difficulties, at, the, end, of, his, life, he, explored, the, lualaba, and, failing, to, find, connections, to, the, nile, returned, to, lake, bangweulu, and, its, swamps, to, explore, possible, rivers, flowing, out, northwards, livingstone, is, known, as, africa, s, greatest, missionary, yet, he, is, recorded, as, having, converted, only, one, african, sechele, who, was, the, chief, of, the, kwena, people, of, botswana, kwena, are, one, of, the, main, sotho, tswana, clans, found, in, south, africa, lesotho, and, botswana, in, all, three, sotho, tswana, language, groupings, sechele, was, born, in, 1812, his, father, died, when, sechele, was, 10, and, two, of, his, uncles, divided, the, tribe, which, forced, sechele, to, leave, his, home, for, nine, years, when, sechele, returned, he, took, over, one, of, his, uncle, s, tribes, at, that, point, he, met, livingstone, livingstone, immediately, became, interested, in, sechele, and, especially, his, ability, to, read, being, a, quick, learner, sechele, learned, the, alphabet, in, two, days, and, soon, called, english, a, second, language, after, teaching, his, wives, the, skill, he, wrote, the, bible, in, his, native, tongue, livingstone, was, known, through, a, large, part, of, africa, for, treating, the, natives, with, respect, and, the, tribes, that, he, visited, returned, his, respect, with, faith, and, loyalty, he, could, never, permanently, convert, the, tribesmen, to, christianity, however, among, other, reasons, sechele, by, then, the, leader, of, the, african, tribe, did, not, like, the, way, that, livingstone, could, not, demand, rain, of, his, god, like, his, rainmakers, who, said, that, they, could, after, long, hesitation, from, livingstone, he, baptised, sechele, and, had, the, church, completely, embrace, him, sechele, was, now, a, part, of, the, church, but, he, continued, to, act, according, to, his, african, culture, which, went, against, livingstone, s, teachings, 20, sechele, was, no, different, from, any, other, man, of, his, tribe, in, believing, in, polygamy, he, had, five, wives, including, mmakgari, setswana, for, mother, of, kgari, mokgokong, and, masebele, when, livingstone, told, him, to, get, rid, of, four, of, them, it, shook, the, foundations, of, the, kwena, tribe, after, he, finally, divorced, the, women, livingstone, baptised, them, all, and, everything, went, well, however, one, year, later, one, of, his, ex, wives, became, pregnant, and, sechele, was, the, father, sechele, begged, livingstone, not, to, give, up, on, him, because, his, faith, was, still, strong, but, livingstone, left, the, country, and, went, north, to, continue, his, christianizing, attempts, after, livingstone, left, the, kwena, tribe, sechele, remained, faithful, to, christianity, and, led, missionaries, to, surrounding, tribes, as, well, as, converting, nearly, his, entire, kwena, people, in, the, estimation, of, neil, parsons, of, the, university, of, botswana, sechele, did, more, to, propagate, christianity, in, 19th, century, southern, africa, than, virtually, any, single, european, missionary, although, sechele, was, a, self, proclaimed, christian, many, european, missionaries, disagreed, the, kwena, tribe, leader, kept, rainmaking, a, part, of, his, life, as, well, as, polygamy, livingstone, died, on, 1, may, 1873, at, the, age, of, 60, in, chief, chitambo, s, village, at, chipundu, southeast, of, lake, bangweulu, in, present, day, zambia, from, malaria, and, internal, bleeding, due, to, dysentery, led, by, his, loyal, attendants, chuma, and, susi, his, expedition, arranged, funeral, ceremonies, they, removed, his, heart, and, buried, it, under, a, tree, near, the, spot, where, he, died, which, has, been, identified, variously, as, a, mvula, tree, or, a, baobab, tree, but, is, more, likely, to, be, a, mpundu, tree, as, baobabs, are, found, at, lower, altitudes, and, in, more, arid, regions, that, site, now, known, as, the, livingstone, memorial, lists, his, date, of, death, as, 4, may, the, date, reported, and, carved, into, the, tree, s, trunk, by, chuma, and, susi, but, most, sources, consider, 1, may, the, date, of, livingstone, s, final, journal, entry, as, the, correct, one, the, expedition, led, by, chuma, and, susi, then, carried, the, rest, of, his, remains, together, with, his, last, journal, and, belongings, on, a, journey, that, took, 63, days, to, the, coastal, town, of, bagamoyo, a, distance, exceeding, 1, 000, miles, 1, 600, km, the, caravan, encountered, the, expedition, of, english, explorer, verney, lovett, cameron, who, continued, his, march, and, reached, ujiji, in, february, 1874, where, he, found, and, sent, to, england, livingstone, s, papers, seventy, nine, followers, completed, the, journey, the, men, were, paid, their, due, wages, and, livingstone, s, remains, were, returned, by, ship, to, britain, for, burial, in, london, his, body, lay, in, repose, at, no, 1, savile, row, then, the, headquarters, of, the, royal, geographical, society, prior, to, interment, at, westminster, abbey, and, if, my, disclosures, regarding, the, terrible, ujijian, slavery, should, lead, to, the, suppression, of, the, east, coast, slave, trade, i, shall, regard, that, as, a, greater, matter, by, far, than, the, discovery, of, all, the, nile, sources, together, while, talking, about, the, slave, trade, in, east, africa, in, his, journals, to, overdraw, its, evil, is, a, simple, impossibility, livingstone, wrote, about, a, group, of, slaves, forced, to, march, by, arab, slave, traders, in, the, african, great, lakes, region, when, he, was, travelling, there, in, 1866, we, passed, a, slave, woman, shot, or, stabbed, through, the, body, and, lying, on, the, path, a, group, of, men, stood, about, a, hundred, yards, off, on, one, side, and, another, of, the, women, on, the, other, side, looking, on, they, said, an, arab, who, passed, early, that, morning, had, done, it, in, anger, at, losing, the, price, he, had, given, for, her, because, she, was, unable, to, walk, any, longer, 27th, june, 1866, to, day, we, came, upon, a, man, dead, from, starvation, as, he, was, very, thin, one, of, our, men, wandered, and, found, many, slaves, with, slave, sticks, on, abandoned, by, their, masters, from, want, of, food, they, were, too, weak, to, be, able, to, speak, or, say, where, they, had, come, from, some, were, quite, young, he, also, described, the, strangest, disease, i, have, seen, in, this, country, seems, really, to, be, broken, heartedness, and, it, attacks, free, men, who, have, been, captured, and, made, slaves, twenty, one, were, unchained, as, now, safe, however, all, ran, away, at, once, but, eight, with, many, others, still, in, chains, died, in, three, days, after, the, crossing, they, described, their, only, pain, in, the, heart, and, placed, the, hand, correctly, on, the, spot, though, many, think, the, organ, stands, high, up, in, the, breast, bone, often, cited, is, livingstone, s, estimate, of, the, number, of, slaves, that, made, it, to, market, versus, those, who, died, because, of, the, slave, trade, flight, starvation, and, death, ensue, and, we, must, again, record, our, conviction, that, the, mortality, after, these, slave, wars, in, addition, to, the, losses, on, the, journey, to, the, coast, and, during, the, middle, passage, makes, it, certain, that, not, more, than, one, in, five, ever, reach, the, kind, masters, in, cuba, and, elsewhere, whom, according, to, slave, owners, interpretation, of, scripture, providence, intended, for, them, livingstone, s, letters, books, and, journals, did, stir, up, public, support, for, the, abolition, of, slavery, however, he, became, dependent, for, assistance, on, the, very, slave, traders, whom, he, wished, to, put, out, of, business, he, was, a, poor, leader, of, his, peers, and, he, ended, up, on, his, last, expedition, as, an, individualist, explorer, with, servants, and, porters, but, no, expert, support, around, him, at, the, same, time, he, did, not, use, the, brutal, methods, of, maverick, explorers, such, as, stanley, to, keep, his, retinue, of, porters, in, line, and, his, supplies, secure, for, these, reasons, he, accepted, help, and, hospitality, from, 1867, onwards, from, mohamad, bogharib, and, mohamad, bin, saleh, also, known, as, mpamari, traders, who, kept, and, traded, in, slaves, as, he, recounts, in, his, journals, they, in, turn, benefited, from, livingstone, s, influence, with, local, people, which, facilitated, mpamari, s, release, from, bondage, to, mwata, kazembe, livingstone, was, furious, to, discover, that, some, of, the, replacement, porters, sent, at, his, request, from, ujiji, were, slaves, livingstone, s, figures, on, slaves, have, however, been, criticised, as, highly, exaggerated, by, the, late, 1860s, livingstone, s, reputation, in, europe, had, suffered, owing, to, the, failure, of, the, missions, he, set, up, and, of, the, zambezi, expedition, and, his, ideas, about, the, source, of, the, nile, were, not, supported, his, expeditions, were, hardly, models, of, order, and, organisation, his, reputation, was, rehabilitated, by, stanley, and, his, newspaper, and, by, the, loyalty, of, livingstone, s, servants, whose, long, journey, with, his, body, inspired, wonder, the, publication, of, his, last, journal, revealed, stubborn, determination, in, the, face, of, suffering, in, 1860, the, universities, mission, to, central, africa, was, founded, at, his, request, many, important, missionaries, such, as, leader, stirling, and, miss, annie, allen, would, later, work, for, this, group, this, group, and, the, medical, missionaries, it, sponsored, came, to, have, major, positive, impact, on, the, people, of, africa, livingstone, made, geographical, discoveries, for, european, knowledge, he, inspired, abolitionists, of, the, slave, trade, explorers, and, missionaries, he, opened, up, central, africa, to, missionaries, who, initiated, the, education, and, healthcare, for, africans, and, trade, by, the, african, lakes, company, he, was, held, in, some, esteem, by, many, african, chiefs, and, local, people, and, his, name, facilitated, relations, between, them, and, the, british, partly, as, a, result, within, 50, years, of, his, death, colonial, rule, was, established, in, africa, and, white, settlement, was, encouraged, to, extend, further, into, the, interior, however, what, livingstone, envisaged, for, colonies, was, not, what, we, now, know, as, colonial, rule, but, rather, settlements, of, dedicated, christian, europeans, who, would, live, among, the, people, to, help, them, work, out, ways, of, living, that, did, not, involve, slavery, livingstone, was, part, of, an, evangelical, and, nonconformist, movement, in, britain, which, during, the, 19th, century, helped, change, the, national, mindset, from, the, notion, of, a, divine, right, to, rule, lesser, races, to, more, modernly, ethical, ideas, in, foreign, policy, the, david, livingstone, centre, in, blantyre, celebrates, his, life, and, is, based, in, the, house, in, which, he, was, born, on, the, site, of, the, mill, in, which, he, started, his, working, life, his, christian, faith, is, evident, in, his, journal, in, which, one, entry, reads, i, place, no, value, on, anything, i, have, or, may, possess, except, in, relation, to, the, kingdom, of, christ, if, anything, will, advance, the, interests, of, the, kingdom, it, shall, be, given, away, or, kept, only, as, by, giving, or, keeping, it, i, shall, promote, the, glory, of, him, to, whom, i, owe, all, my, hopes, in, time, and, eternity, according, to, alvyn, austin, in, 1997, during, the, anti, colonial, 1960s, livingstone, was, debunked, he, made, only, one, certified, convert, who, later, backslid, he, explored, few, areas, not, already, traveled, by, others, he, freed, few, slaves, he, treated, his, colleagues, horribly, he, traveled, with, arab, slave, traders, his, family, life, was, in, shambles, in, short, to, many, he, embodied, the, white, man, s, burden, mentality, nonetheless, at, a, time, when, countries, are, being, renamed, and, statues, are, being, toppled, livingstone, has, not, fallen, despite, modern, africans, animosity, toward, other, europeans, such, as, cecil, rhodes, livingstone, endures, as, a, heroic, legend,

was, named, among, the, 100, greatest, britons, following, a, uk, wide, vote, while, livingstone, had, a, great, impact, on, the, expansion, of, the, british, empire, he, did, so, at, a, tremendous, cost, to, his, family, in, his, absences, his, children, grew, up, missing, their, father, and, his, wife, mary, daughter, of, mary, and, robert, moffat, whom, he, married, in, 1845, endured, very, poor, health, and, died, of, malaria, on, 27, april, 1862, he, had, six, children, only, agnes, william, oswell, and, anna, mary, married, and, had, children, his, one, regret, in, later, life, was, that, he, did, not, spend, enough, time, with, his, children, the, archives, of, david, livingstone, are, maintained, by, the, archives, of, the, university, of, glasgow, guas, on, 11, november, 2011,
