making, him, the, nominal, governor, of, musashi, province, fujiwara, was, the, lineage, from, which, musashi, claimed, descent, musashi, s, eczema, developed, in, his, infancy, and, this, adversely, affected, his, appearance, another, story, claims, that, he, never, bathed, himself, because, he, did, not, want, to, be, surprised, unarmed, according, to, go, rin, no, sho, musashi, testified, that, his, first, duel, occurred, when, he, was, still, 13, years, old, against, a, swordsman, named, arima, kihei, who, practiced, kashima, shint, ry, martial, arts, that, were, created, by, tsukahara, bokuden, musashi, was, victorious, the, second, duel, happened, when, musashi, was, 16, years, old, when, he, won, another, victory, against, a, swordsman, named, tadashima, akiyama, a, native, of, tajima, province, his, third, duel, came, when, he, was, aged, 21, in, kyoto, where, he, defeated, several, students, of, a, famous, sword, fighting, school, in, 1599, musashi, left, his, village, apparently, at, the, age, of, 15, according, to, the, tosakushi, the, registry, of, the, sakushu, region, although, the, tanji, hokin, hikki, says, he, was, 16, years, old, in, 1599, which, agrees, time, wise, with, the, age, reported, in, musashi, s, first, duel, his, family, possessions, such, as, furniture, weapons, genealogy, and, other, records, were, left, with, his, sister, and, her, husband, hirao, yoemon, he, spent, his, time, traveling, and, engaging, in, duels, in, 1600, musashi, is, said, to, have, participated, in, the, battle, of, sekigahara, for, a, long, time, the, prevailing, opinion, has, been, that, musashi, participated, in, the, sekigahara, battle, on, the, western, army, side, due, to, the, fact, that, shinmen, clan, was, longtime, vassal, to, the, ukita, clan, however, recent, research, by, modern, japanese, historians, such, as, masahide, fukuda, and, watanabe, daimon, about, musashi, has, opined, that, musashi, and, his, father, shinmen, munisai, actually, sided, with, the, eastern, army, during, the, war, based, on, the, historical, records, that, munisai, no, longer, served, the, ukita, clan, and, the, clan, records, of, kuroda, clan, ally, of, tokugawa, ieyasu, during, the, war, had, recorded, the, name, of, shinmen, munisai, among, their, vassals, who, participated, in, the, war, daimon, who, quoted, the, matsui, clan, document, has, opined, that, the, notion, that, musashi, fought, on, the, losing, side, of, western, army, both, in, sekigahara, and, in, osaka, siege, 14, years, later, were, only, based, on, legendary, romanticism, about, musashi, being, a, ronin, while, the, primary, history, records, indicated, that, musashi, always, fought, on, the, side, of, tokugawa, who, emerged, victorious, in, both, conflicts, the, main, issue, debated, was, if, musashi, fought, in, the, sekigahara, battle, with, the, eastern, army, main, forces, under, tokugawa, or, did, he, fight, in, ishigakibaru, of, western, province, theater, under, the, eastern, army, commander, kuroda, yoshitaka, daimon, more, leaned, to, the, opinion, that, musashi, fought, in, ishigakibaru, instead, of, sekigahara, by, historical, record, of, the, transmission, of, military, art, to, master, bushu, genshin, meanwhile, fukuda, has, pointed, out, that, the, name, of, munisai, appeared, in, kuroda, clan, record, under, the, category, of, kogofudai, or, kuroda, clan, vassals, who, had, entered, service, before, 1586, based, on, this, fact, fukuda, concluded, it, was, natural, that, munisai, and, musashi, were, on, the, tokugawa, side, during, the, war, just, as, the, kuroda, clan, which, they, served, furthermore, japanese, history, novelist, kengo, tominaga, proposed, a, theory, that, musashi, during, the, sekigahara, campaign, did, not, fight, in, the, main, battle, of, sekigahara, but, instead, he, fought, under, kuroda, yoshitaka, against, ishida, mitsunari, loyalists, from, the, western, provinces, in, the, battle, of, ishigakibaru, ita, prefecture, in, december, 1608, it, was, reported, that, musashi, met, with, mizuno, katsunari, a, tokugawa, general, musashi, taught, katsunari, the, secret, techniques, of, his, swordstyle, in, 1611, musashi, learned, zazen, at, my, shin, ji, ky, sh, after, the, sekigahara, battle, musashi, introduced, to, nagaoka, sado, an, official, of, daimyo, lord, named, hosokawa, tadaoki, at, sometimes, in, unclear, circumstances, musashi, was, challenged, to, a, duel, by, a, swordsman, named, sasaki, kojir, musashi, agreed, to, the, challenge, and, it, was, scheduled, for, them, to, fight, on, april, 13th, one, year, later, at, ganry, jima, island, which, was, filled, with, spectators, who, wanted, to, watch, the, duel, kojir, was, known, for, being, armed, with, a, nodachi, it, was, said, that, musashi, deliberately, came, later, than, the, promised, hour, and, he, carved, a, wooden, bokken, from, an, oar, using, his, knife, during, his, journey, to, the, island, with, a, boat, upon, his, arrival, kojir, who, lost, his, patience, from, waiting, taunted, musashi, for, his, tardiness, who, responded, by, further, banter, from, musashi, calmly, the, duel, ended, shortly, as, musashi, managed, to, instantly, kill, kojir, by, crushing, his, skull, with, a, vertical, stroke, aimed, to, his, head, in, 1614, during, the, siege, of, osaka, it, was, believed, that, musashi, participated, in, tokugawa, army, under, the, command, of, musashi, s, personal, friend, mizuno, katsushige, or, also, known, as, katsunari, musashi, were, reportedly, carrying, the, banner, of, katsunari, and, also, acted, as, bodyguard, of, mizuno, katsutoshi, son, of, katsunari, it, was, said, in, a, later, era, during, the, shimabara, rebellion, that, musashi, once, told, a, commander, of, the, tokugawa, army, that, he, had, served, under, mizuno, katsunari, s, command, during, the, osaka, siege, and, knew, the, military, system, very, well, miyamoto, mikinosuke, the, adopted, son, of, musashi, also, served, under, katsunari, during, this, battle, in, 1633, musashi, began, staying, with, hosokawa, tadatoshi, daimy, of, kumamoto, castle, who, had, moved, to, the, kumamoto, fief, and, kokura, to, train, and, paint, while, he, engaged, in, very, few, duels, during, this, period, one, occurred, in, 1634, at, the, arrangement, of, lord, ogasawara, in, which, musashi, defeated, a, lance, specialist, named, takada, matabei, musashi, officially, became, the, retainer, of, the, hosokowa, lords, of, kumamoto, in, 1640, the, niten, ki, records, received, from, lord, tadatoshi, 17, retainers, a, stipend, of, 300, koku, the, rank, of, kumigashira, and, chiba, castle, in, kumamoto, as, his, residence, in, 1638, musashi, allegedly, participated, in, the, suppression, of, shimabara, rebellion, in, munekyu, katsunari, sama, journal, which, is, a, collection, of, things, that, katsunari, mizuno, said, after, his, retirement, in, 1639, there, is, a, story, about, mizuno, s, army, during, the, shimabara, rebellion, where, a, man, named, miyamoto, musashi, entered, the, camp, of, general, ogasawara, nagatsugu, and, musashi, has, said, last, time, in, siege, of, osaka, mizuno, katsunari, hyuga, no, kamidono, s, clan, had, this, and, i, knew, the, military, system, very, well, musashi, continues, by, saying, he, is, a, great, general, that, no, one, can, match, in, the, second, month, of, 1641, musashi, wrote, a, work, called, the, hyoho, sanju, go, thirty, five, instructions, on, strategy, for, hosokawa, tadatoshi, this, work, overlapped, and, formed, the, basis, for, the, later, the, book, of, five, rings, this, was, the, year, that, his, adopted, son, hirao, yoemon, became, master, of, arms, for, the, owari, fief, in, 1642, musashi, suffered, attacks, of, neuralgia, foreshadowing, his, future, ill, health, in, 1643, he, retired, to, a, cave, named, reigand, as, a, hermit, to, write, the, book, of, five, rings, he, finished, it, in, the, second, month, of, 1645, on, the, twelfth, of, the, fifth, month, sensing, his, impending, death, musashi, bequeathed, his, worldly, possessions, after, giving, his, manuscript, copy, of, the, book, of, five, rings, to, the, younger, brother, of, terao, magonojo, his, closest, disciple, he, died, in, reigand, cave, around, june, 13, 1645, sh, h, 2, 19th, day, of, the, 5th, month, the, hyoho, senshi, denki, described, his, death, at, the, moment, of, his, death, he, had, himself, raised, up, he, had, his, belt, tightened, and, his, wakizashi, put, in, it, he, seated, himself, with, one, knee, vertically, raised, holding, the, sword, with, his, left, hand, and, a, cane, in, his, right, hand, he, died, in, this, posture, at, the, age, of, sixty, two, the, principal, vassals, of, lord, hosokawa, and, the, other, officers, gathered, and, they, painstakingly, carried, out, the, ceremony, then, they, set, up, a, tomb, on, mount, iwato, on, the, order, of, the, lord, miyamoto, musashi, died, in, 1645, after, allegedly, suffering, from, lung, cancer, the, following, timeline, of, musashi, biography, in, chronological, order, of, which, is, based, on, the, most, accurate, and, most, widely, accepted, information, it, was, said, that, musashi, practiced, the, way, of, the, warrior, and, warfare, strategy, which, entailed, the, mastery, of, many, art, forms, beyond, that, of, the, sword, such, as, tea, ceremony, sad, laboring, writing, and, painting, all, of, which, musashi, pursued, throughout, his, life, writings, on, musashi, s, life, rarely, mention, his, relationship, with, women, and, often, when, they, do, musashi, is, regularly, depicted, as, rejecting, sexual, advances, in, favor, of, focusing, on, his, swordsmanship, alternative, interpretations, have, taken, his, lack, of, interest, as, an, indication, of, homosexuality, in, contrast, many, legends, feature, musashi, in, trysts, with, women, some, of, which, also, reflect, the, view, that, he, eventually, chose, to, forego, physical, or, emotional, investments, to, attain, further, insight, into, his, work, this, predominant, cultural, view, of, musashi, is, somewhat, contradicted, by, old, texts, such, as, dobo, goen, 1720, which, relay, his, intimacy, with, the, courtesan, kumoi, in, his, middle, age, the, bushu, denraiki, details, musashi, fathering, a, daughter, by, a, courtesan, it, is, uncertain, if, this, courtesan, and, kumoi, were, the, same, person, a, rumor, also, connected, musashi, with, the, oiran, yoshino, tayu, musashi, created, and, refined, a, two, sword, kenjutsu, technique, called, niten, ichi, two, heavens, as, one, or, nit, ichi, two, swords, as, one, or, niten, ichi, ry, a, kongen, buddhist, sutra, refers, to, the, two, heavens, as, the, two, guardians, of, buddha, in, this, technique, the, swordsman, uses, both, a, large, sword, and, a, companion, sword, at, the, same, time, i, e, a, katana, with, a, wakizashi, the, two, handed, movements, of, temple, drummers, may, have, inspired, him, although, it, could, be, that, the, technique, was, forged, through, musashi, s, combat, experience, jitte, techniques, were, taught, to, him, by, his, father, the, jitte, was, often, used, in, battle, paired, with, a, sword, the, jitte, would, parry, and, neutralize, the, weapon, of, the, enemy, while, the, sword, struck, or, the, practitioner, grappled, with, the, enemy, today, musashi, s, style, of, swordsmanship, is, known, as, hy, h, niten, ichi, ry, musashi, was, also, an, expert, in, throwing, weapons, he, frequently, threw, his, short, sword, and, kenji, tokitsu, believes, that, shuriken, methods, for, the, wakizashi, were, the, niten, ichi, ryu, s, secret, techniques, within, the, book, musashi, mentions, that, the, use, of, two, swords, within, strategy, is, equally, beneficial, to, those, who, use, the, skill, for, individual, duels, or, large, engagements, the, idea, of, using, two, hands, for, a, sword, is, an, idea, that, musashi, opposes, because, there, is, no, fluidity, in, movement, with, two, hands, if, you, hold, a, sword, with, both, hands, it, is, difficult, to, wield, it, freely, to, left, and, right, so, my, method, is, to, carry, the, sword, in, one, hand, he, also, disagrees, with, the, idea, of, using, a, sword, with, two, hands, on, a, horse, and, or, riding, on, unstable, terrain, such, as, muddy, swamps, rice, fields, or, within, crowds, of, people, to, learn, the, strategy, of, ni, ten, ichi, ry, musashi, asserts, that, by, training, with, two, long, swords, one, in, each, hand, one, will, be, able, to, overcome, the, cumbersome, nature, of, using, a, sword, in, both, hands, although, it, is, difficult, musashi, agrees, that, there, are, times, in, which, the, long, sword, must, be, used, with, two, hands, but, one, skillful, enough, should, not, need, it, after, using, two, long, swords, proficiently, enough, mastery, of, a, long, sword, and, a, companion, sword, most, likely, a, wakizashi, will, be, much, increased, when, you, become, used, to, wielding, the, long, sword, you, will, gain, the, power, of, the, way, and, wield, the, sword, well, in, short, it, could, be, seen, from, the, excerpts, from, the, book, of, five, rings, that, real, strategy, behind, ni, ten, no, ichi, ryu, is, that, there, is, no, real, iron, clad, method, path, or, type, of, weaponry, specific, to, the, style, of, ni, ten, no, ichi, ryu, you, can, win, with, a, long, weapon, and, yet, you, can, also, win, with, a, short, weapon, in, short, the, way, of, the, ichi, school, is, the, spirit, of, winning, whatever, the, weapon, and, whatever, its, size, even, from, an, early, age, musashi, separated, his, religion, from, his, involvement, in, swordsmanship, excerpts, such, as, the, one, below, from, the, book, of, five, rings, demonstrate, a, philosophy, that, is, thought, to, have, stayed, with, him, throughout, his, life, there, are, many, ways, confucianism, buddhism, the, ways, of, elegance, rice, planting, or, dance, these, things, are, not, to, be, found, in, the, way, of, the, warrior, however, the, belief, that, musashi, disliked, shinto, is, inaccurate, as, he, criticises, the, shint, ry, style, of, swordsmanship, not, shinto, the, religion, in, musashi, s, dokk, d, his, stance, on, religion, is, further, elucidated, respect, buddha, and, the, gods, without, counting, on, their, help, in, his, later, years, musashi, said, in, his, the, book, of, five, rings, when, i, apply, the, principle, of, strategy, to, the, ways, of, different, arts, and, crafts, i, no, longer, have, need, for, a, teacher, in, any, domain, he, proved, this, by, creating, recognized, masterpieces, of, calligraphy, and, classic, ink, painting, his, paintings, are, characterized, by, skilled, use, of, ink, washes, and, an, economy, of, brush, stroke, he, especially, mastered, the, broken, ink, school, of, landscapes, applying, it, to, other, subjects, such, as, his, kobokumeikakuzu, shrike, perched, on, a, withered, branch, part, of, a, triptych, whose, other, two, members, were, hotei, walking, and, sparrow, on, bamboo, his, hotei, watching, a, cockfight, and, his, rozanzu, wild, geese, among, reeds, the, book, of, five, rings, advocates, involvement, in, calligraphy, and, other, arts, as, a, means, of, training, in, the, art, of, war, musashi, also, known, as, talented, sumi, e, who, produced, several, paintings, such, as, shrike, perched, in, a, dead, tree, koboku, meigekizu, and, wild, geese, among, reeds, rozanzu,
