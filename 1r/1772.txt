eli, whitney, jr, december, 8, 1765, january, 8, 1825, was, an, american, inventor, widely, known, for, inventing, the, cotton, gin, in, 1793, one, of, the, key, inventions, of, the, industrial, revolution, that, shaped, the, economy, of, the, antebellum, south, whitney, s, invention, made, upland, short, cotton, into, a, profitable, crop, which, strengthened, the, economic, foundation, of, slavery, in, the, united, states, and, prolonged, the, institution, despite, the, social, and, economic, impact, of, his, invention, whitney, lost, much, of, his, profits, in, legal, battles, over, patent, infringement, for, the, cotton, gin, thereafter, he, turned, his, attention, to, securing, contracts, with, the, government, in, the, manufacture, of, muskets, for, the, newly, formed, united, states, army, he, continued, making, arms, and, inventing, until, his, death, in, 1825, whitney, was, born, in, westborough, massachusetts, on, december, 8, 1765, the, eldest, child, of, eli, whitney, sr, a, prosperous, farmer, and, his, wife, elizabeth, fay, also, of, westborough, the, younger, eli, was, famous, during, his, lifetime, and, after, his, death, by, the, name, eli, whitney, though, he, was, technically, eli, whitney, jr, his, son, born, in, 1820, also, named, eli, was, known, during, his, lifetime, and, afterward, by, the, name, eli, whitney, jr, whitney, s, mother, elizabeth, fay, died, in, 1777, when, he, was, 11, at, age, 14, he, operated, a, profitable, nail, manufacturing, operation, in, his, father, s, workshop, during, the, revolutionary, war, because, his, stepmother, opposed, his, wish, to, attend, college, whitney, worked, as, a, farm, laborer, and, school, teacher, to, save, money, he, prepared, for, yale, at, leicester, academy, now, becker, college, and, under, the, tutelage, of, rev, elizur, goodrich, of, durham, connecticut, he, entered, in, the, fall, of, 1789, and, graduated, phi, beta, kappa, in, 1792, whitney, expected, to, study, law, but, finding, himself, short, of, funds, accepted, an, offer, to, go, to, south, carolina, as, a, private, tutor, instead, of, reaching, his, destination, he, was, convinced, to, visit, georgia, in, the, closing, years, of, the, 18th, century, georgia, was, a, magnet, for, new, englanders, seeking, their, fortunes, its, revolutionary, era, governor, had, been, lyman, hall, a, migrant, from, connecticut, when, he, initially, sailed, for, south, carolina, among, his, shipmates, were, the, widow, catherine, littlefield, greene, and, family, of, the, revolutionary, hero, gen, nathanael, greene, of, rhode, island, mrs, greene, invited, whitney, to, visit, her, georgia, plantation, mulberry, grove, her, plantation, manager, and, husband, to, be, was, phineas, miller, another, connecticut, migrant, and, yale, graduate, class, of, 1785, who, would, become, whitney, s, business, partner, whitney, is, most, famous, for, two, innovations, which, came, to, have, significant, impacts, on, the, united, states, in, the, mid, 19th, century, the, cotton, gin, 1793, and, his, advocacy, of, interchangeable, parts, in, the, south, the, cotton, gin, revolutionized, the, way, cotton, was, harvested, and, reinvigorated, slavery, conversely, in, the, north, the, adoption, of, interchangeable, parts, revolutionized, the, manufacturing, industry, contributing, greatly, to, the, u, s, victory, in, the, civil, war, the, cotton, gin, is, a, mechanical, device, that, removes, the, seeds, from, cotton, a, process, that, had, previously, been, extremely, labor, intensive, the, word, gin, is, short, for, engine, while, staying, at, mulberry, grove, whitney, constructed, several, ingenious, household, devices, which, led, mrs, greene, to, introduce, him, to, some, businessmen, who, were, discussing, the, desirability, of, a, machine, to, separate, the, short, staple, upland, cotton, from, its, seeds, work, that, was, then, done, by, hand, at, the, rate, of, a, pound, of, lint, a, day, in, a, few, weeks, whitney, produced, a, model, the, cotton, gin, was, a, wooden, drum, stuck, with, hooks, that, pulled, the, cotton, fibers, through, a, mesh, the, cotton, seeds, would, not, fit, through, the, mesh, and, fell, outside, whitney, occasionally, told, a, story, wherein, he, was, pondering, an, improved, method, of, seeding, the, cotton, when, he, was, inspired, by, observing, a, cat, attempting, to, pull, a, chicken, through, a, fence, and, able, to, only, pull, through, some, of, the, feathers, a, single, cotton, gin, could, generate, up, to, 55, pounds, 25, kg, of, cleaned, cotton, daily, this, contributed, to, the, economic, development, of, the, southern, united, states, a, prime, cotton, growing, area, some, historians, believe, that, this, invention, allowed, for, the, african, slavery, system, in, the, southern, united, states, to, become, more, sustainable, at, a, critical, point, in, its, development, whitney, applied, for, the, patent, for, his, cotton, gin, on, october, 28, 1793, and, received, the, patent, later, numbered, as, x72, on, march, 14, 1794, but, it, was, not, validated, until, 1807, whitney, and, his, partner, miller, did, not, intend, to, sell, the, gins, rather, like, the, proprietors, of, gristmills, and, sawmills, they, expected, to, charge, farmers, for, cleaning, their, cotton, two, fifths, of, the, value, paid, in, cotton, resentment, at, this, scheme, the, mechanical, simplicity, of, the, device, and, the, primitive, state, of, patent, law, made, infringement, inevitable, whitney, and, miller, could, not, build, enough, gins, to, meet, demand, so, gins, from, other, makers, found, ready, sale, ultimately, patent, infringement, lawsuits, consumed, the, profits, one, patent, later, annulled, was, granted, in, 1796, to, hogden, holmes, for, a, gin, which, substituted, circular, saws, for, the, spikes, and, their, cotton, gin, company, went, out, of, business, in, 1797, one, oft, overlooked, point, is, that, there, were, drawbacks, to, whitney, s, first, design, there, are, claims, that, the, use, of, wires, rather, than, pegs, was, proposed, by, mrs, greene, but, these, are, disputed, after, validation, of, the, patent, the, legislature, of, south, carolina, voted, 50, 000, for, the, rights, for, that, state, while, north, carolina, levied, a, license, tax, for, five, years, from, which, about, 30, 000, was, realized, there, is, a, claim, that, tennessee, paid, about, 10, 000, while, the, cotton, gin, did, not, earn, whitney, the, fortune, he, had, hoped, for, it, did, give, him, fame, it, has, been, argued, by, some, historians, that, whitney, s, cotton, gin, was, an, important, if, unintended, cause, of, the, american, civil, war, after, whitney, s, invention, the, plantation, slavery, industry, was, rejuvenated, eventually, culminating, in, the, civil, war, the, cotton, gin, transformed, southern, agriculture, and, the, national, economy, southern, cotton, found, ready, markets, in, europe, and, in, the, burgeoning, textile, mills, of, new, england, cotton, exports, from, the, u, s, boomed, after, the, cotton, gin, s, appearance, from, less, than, 500, 000, pounds, 230, 000, kg, in, 1793, to, 93, million, pounds, 42, 000, 000, kg, by, 1810, cotton, was, a, staple, that, could, be, stored, for, long, periods, and, shipped, long, distances, unlike, most, agricultural, products, it, became, the, u, s, s, chief, export, representing, over, half, the, value, of, u, s, exports, from, 1820, to, 1860, whitney, believed, that, his, cotton, gin, would, reduce, the, demand, for, enslaved, labor, and, would, help, hasten, the, end, of, southern, slavery, paradoxically, the, cotton, gin, a, labor, saving, device, helped, preserve, and, prolong, slavery, in, the, united, states, for, another, 70, years, before, the, 1790s, slave, labor, was, primarily, employed, in, growing, rice, tobacco, and, indigo, none, of, which, were, especially, profitable, anymore, neither, was, cotton, due, to, the, difficulty, of, seed, removal, but, with, the, invention, of, the, gin, growing, cotton, with, slave, labor, became, highly, profitable, the, chief, source, of, wealth, in, the, american, south, and, the, basis, of, frontier, settlement, from, georgia, to, texas, king, cotton, became, a, dominant, economic, force, and, slavery, was, sustained, as, a, key, institution, of, southern, society, eli, whitney, has, often, been, incorrectly, credited, with, inventing, the, idea, of, interchangeable, parts, which, he, championed, for, years, as, a, maker, of, muskets, however, the, idea, predated, whitney, and, whitney, s, role, in, it, was, one, of, promotion, and, popularizing, not, invention, successful, implementation, of, the, idea, eluded, whitney, until, near, the, end, of, his, life, occurring, first, in, others, armories, attempts, at, interchangeability, of, parts, can, be, traced, back, as, far, as, the, punic, wars, through, both, archaeological, remains, of, boats, now, in, museo, archeologico, baglio, anselmi, and, contemporary, written, accounts, in, modern, times, the, idea, developed, over, decades, among, many, people, an, early, leader, was, jean, baptiste, vaquette, de, gribeauval, an, 18th, century, french, artillerist, who, created, a, fair, amount, of, standardization, of, artillery, pieces, although, not, true, interchangeability, of, parts, he, inspired, others, including, honor, blanc, and, louis, de, tousard, to, work, further, on, the, idea, and, on, shoulder, weapons, as, well, as, artillery, in, the, 19th, century, these, efforts, produced, the, armory, system, or, american, system, of, manufacturing, certain, other, new, englanders, including, captain, john, h, hall, and, simeon, north, arrived, at, successful, interchangeability, before, whitney, s, armory, did, the, whitney, armory, finally, succeeded, not, long, after, his, death, in, 1825, the, motives, behind, whitney, s, acceptance, of, a, contract, to, manufacture, muskets, in, 1798, were, mostly, monetary, by, the, late, 1790s, whitney, was, on, the, verge, of, bankruptcy, and, the, cotton, gin, litigation, had, left, him, deeply, in, debt, his, new, haven, cotton, gin, factory, had, burned, to, the, ground, and, litigation, sapped, his, remaining, resources, the, french, revolution, had, ignited, new, conflicts, between, great, britain, france, and, the, united, states, the, new, american, government, realizing, the, need, to, prepare, for, war, began, to, rearm, the, war, department, issued, contracts, for, the, manufacture, of, 10, 000, muskets, whitney, who, had, never, made, a, gun, in, his, life, obtained, a, contract, in, january, 1798, to, deliver, 10, 000, to, 15, 000, muskets, in, 1800, he, had, not, mentioned, interchangeable, parts, at, that, time, ten, months, later, the, treasury, secretary, oliver, wolcott, jr, sent, him, a, foreign, pamphlet, on, arms, manufacturing, techniques, possibly, one, of, honor, blanc, s, reports, after, which, whitney, first, began, to, talk, about, interchangeability, in, may, 1798, congress, voted, for, legislation, that, would, use, 800, 000, dollars, in, order, to, pay, for, small, arms, and, cannons, in, case, war, with, france, erupted, it, offered, a, 5, 000, dollar, incentive, with, an, additional, 5, 000, dollars, once, that, money, was, exhausted, for, the, person, that, was, able, to, accurately, produce, arms, for, the, government, because, the, cotton, gin, had, not, brought, whitney, the, rewards, he, believed, it, promised, he, accepted, the, offer, although, the, contract, was, for, one, year, whitney, did, not, deliver, the, arms, until, 1809, using, multiple, excuses, for, the, delay, recently, historians, have, found, that, during, 1801, 1806, whitney, took, the, money, and, headed, into, south, carolina, in, order, to, profit, from, the, cotton, gin, although, whitney, s, demonstration, of, 1801, appeared, to, show, the, feasibility, of, creating, interchangeable, parts, merritt, roe, smith, concludes, that, it, was, staged, and, duped, government, authorities, into, believing, that, he, had, been, successful, the, charade, gained, him, time, and, resources, toward, achieving, that, goal, when, the, government, complained, that, whitney, s, price, per, musket, compared, unfavorably, with, those, produced, in, government, armories, he, was, able, to, calculate, an, actual, price, per, musket, by, including, fixed, costs, such, as, insurance, and, machinery, which, the, government, had, not, accounted, for, he, thus, made, early, contributions, to, both, the, concepts, of, cost, accounting, and, economic, efficiency, in, manufacturing, machine, tool, historian, joseph, w, roe, credited, whitney, with, inventing, the, first, milling, machine, circa, 1818, subsequent, work, by, other, historians, woodbury, smith, muir, battison, suggests, that, whitney, was, among, a, group, of, contemporaries, all, developing, milling, machines, at, about, the, same, time, 1814, to, 1818, and, that, the, others, were, more, important, to, the, innovation, than, whitney, was, the, machine, that, excited, roe, may, not, have, been, built, until, 1825, after, whitney, s, death, therefore, no, one, person, can, properly, be, described, as, the, inventor, of, the, milling, machine, despite, his, humble, origins, whitney, was, keenly, aware, of, the, value, of, social, and, political, connections, in, building, his, arms, business, he, took, full, advantage, of, the, access, that, his, status, as, a, yale, alumnus, gave, him, to, other, well, placed, graduates, such, as, oliver, wolcott, jr, secretary, of, the, treasury, class, of, 1778, and, james, hillhouse, a, new, haven, developer, and, political, leader, his, 1817, marriage, to, henrietta, edwards, granddaughter, of, the, famed, evangelist, jonathan, edwards, daughter, of, pierpont, edwards, head, of, the, democratic, party, in, connecticut, and, first, cousin, of, yale, s, president, timothy, dwight, the, state, s, leading, federalist, further, tied, him, to, connecticut, s, ruling, elite, in, a, business, dependent, on, government, contracts, such, connections, were, essential, to, success, whitney, died, of, prostate, cancer, on, january, 8, 1825, in, new, haven, connecticut, just, a, month, after, his, 59th, birthday, he, left, a, widow, and, his, four, children, behind, one, of, his, offspring, eli, whitney, iii, known, as, eli, whitney, jr, was, instrumental, in, building, new, haven, connecticut, s, waterworks, during, the, course, of, his, illness, he, reportedly, invented, and, constructed, several, devices, to, mechanically, ease, his, pain, the, eli, whitney, students, program, yale, university, s, admissions, program, for, non, traditional, students, is, named, in, honor, of, whitney, who, not, only, began, his, studies, there, when, he, was, 23, but, also, went, on, to, graduate, phi, beta, kappa, in, just, three, years
