asked, a, performer, his, religion, his, race, or, his, politics, performers, are, engaged, on, the, basis, of, their, abilities, i, believe, that, this, is, another, quality, of, our, show, that, has, helped, win, it, a, wide, and, loyal, audience, although, sullivan, was, wary, of, elvis, presley, s, image, and, initially, said, that, he, would, never, book, him, presley, became, too, big, a, name, to, ignore, in, 1956, sullivan, signed, him, for, three, appearances, six, weeks, earlier, in, august, 1956, sullivan, and, his, son, in, law, the, producer, of, the, show, robert, precht, were,

with, presley, made, him, determined, to, book, the, next, big, sensation, first, in, november, 1963, while, at, heathrow, airport, sullivan, witnessed, the, beatlemania, spectacle, as, the, band, returned, from, sweden, and, the, terminal, was, overrun, by, screaming, teens, at, first, sullivan, was, reluctant, to, book, the, beatles, because, the, band, did, not, yet, have, a, commercially, successful, single, in, the, u, s, but, at, the, behest, of, his, friend, sid, bernstein, sullivan, signed, the, group, their, initial, sullivan, show, appearance, on, february, 9, 1964, was, the, most, watched, program, in, tv, history, to, that, point, the, beatles, appeared, three, more, times, in, person, and, submitted, filmed, performances, afterwards, the, dave, clark, five, who, claimed, a, cleaner, image, than, the, beatles, made, 13, appearances, on, the, show, more, than, any, other, uk, group, unlike, many, shows, of, the, time, sullivan, asked, that, most, musical, acts, perform, their, music, live, rather, than, lip, synching, to, their, recordings, however, exceptions, were, made, such, as, when, a, microphone, could, not, be, placed, close, enough, to, a, performer, for, technical, reasons, an, example, was, b, j, thomas, 1969, performance, of, raindrops, keep, fallin, on, my, head, in, which, water, was, sprinkled, on, him, as, a, special, effect, in, 1969, sullivan, presented, the, jackson, 5, with, their, first, single, i, want, you, back, which, ousted, thomas, song, from, the, top, spot, of, the, billboard, hot, 100, sullivan, had, an, appreciation, for, black, entertainers, according, to, biographer, gerald, nachman, most, tv, variety, shows, welcomed, acceptable, lack, superstars, like, louis, armstrong, pearl, bailey, and, sammy, davis, jr, but, in, the, early, 1950s, long, before, it, was, fashionable, sullivan, was, presenting, the, much, more, obscure, lack, entertainers, he, had, enjoyed, in, harlem, on, his, uptown, rounds, legends, like, peg, leg, bates, pigmeat, markham, and, tim, moore, strangers, to, white, america, he, hosted, pioneering, tv, appearances, by, bo, diddley, the, platters, brook, benton, jackie, wilson, fats, domino, and, numerous, motown, acts, including, the, supremes, who, appeared, 17, times, as, the, critic, john, leonard, wrote, there, wasn, t, an, important, lack, artist, who, didn, t, appear, on, ed, s, show, sullivan, defied, pressure, to, exclude, black, entertainers, or, to, avoid, interacting, with, them, on, screen, sullivan, had, to, fend, off, his, hard, won, sponsor, ford, s, lincoln, dealers, after, kissing, pearl, bailey, on, the, cheek, and, daring, to, shake, nat, king, cole, s, hand, nachman, wrote, according, to, biographer, jerry, bowles, sullivan, once, had, a, ford, executive, thrown, out, of, the, theatre, when, he, suggested, that, sullivan, stop, booking, so, many, lack, acts, and, a, dealer, in, cleveland, told, him, we, realize, that, you, got, to, have, niggers, on, your, show, but, do, you, have, to, put, your, arm, around, bill, bojangles, robinson, at, the, end, of, his, dance, sullivan, had, to, be, physically, restrained, from, beating, the, man, to, a, pulp, sullivan, later, raised, money, to, help, pay, for, robinson, s, funeral, at, a, cbs, affiliates, meeting, in, the, late, 1950s, several, southern, station, managers, complained, that, sullivan, was, booking, too, many, negroes, furious, sullivan, referred, to, the, comments, in, his, presentation, and, said, that, any, station, manager, that, feels, this, way, is, under, no, obligation, to, carry, the, show, there, were, no, cancellations, sullivan, said, as, a, catholic, it, was, inevitable, that, i, would, despise, intolerance, because, catholics, suffered, more, than, their, share, of, it, as, i, grew, up, the, causes, of, minorities, were, part, and, parcel, of, me, negroes, and, jews, were, the, minority, causes, closest, at, hand, i, need, no, urging, to, take, a, plunge, in, and, help, at, a, time, when, television, had, not, yet, embraced, country, and, western, music, sullivan, featured, nashville, performers, on, his, program, this, in, turn, paved, the, way, for, shows, such, as, hee, haw, and, variety, shows, hosted, by, johnny, cash, glen, campbell, and, other, country, singers, the, canadian, comedy, duo, wayne, and, shuster, made, the, most, appearances, of, any, act, throughout, the, show, s, run, with, 67, appearances, between, 1958, and, 1969, sullivan, appeared, as, himself, on, other, television, programs, including, an, april, 1958, episode, of, the, howard, duff, and, ida, lupino, cbs, situation, comedy, mr, adams, and, eve, on, september, 14, 1958, sullivan, appeared, on, what, s, my, line,

character, freddie, the, freeloader, renamed, eddie, the, freeloader, sullivan, was, quick, to, take, offense, if, he, felt, that, he, had, been, crossed, and, he, could, hold, a, grudge, for, a, long, time, as, he, told, biographer, gerald, nachman, i, m, a, pop, off, i, flare, up, then, i, go, around, apologizing, armed, with, an, irish, temper, and, thin, skin, wrote, nachman, ed, brought, to, his, feuds, a, hunger, for, combat, fed, by, his, coverage, of, and, devotion, to, boxing, bo, diddley, buddy, holly, jackie, mason, and, jim, morrison, were, parties, to, some, of, sullivan, s, most, storied, conflicts, on, november, 20, 1955, african, american, rock, n, roll, singer, and, guitarist, bo, diddley, appeared, on, the, ed, sullivan, show, only, to, infuriate, sullivan, a, reporter, who, was, there, at, the, time, described, what, happened, controversy, raged, at, the, cbs, studio, 57, last, sunday, in, a, verbal, battle, that, started, over, one, of, the, performer, s, refusal, to, do, a, number, on, the, telecast, which, sullivan, had, requested, during, the, dress, rehearsal, bo, diddley, agreed, to, do, sixteen, tons, as, marlo, lewis, toast, of, the, town, s, executive, producer, and, sullivan, had, requested, however, at, 8, 29, pm, as, sullivan, went, into, commercial, the, folk, singer, hurried, to, the, side, of, ray, block, musical, director, to, announce, he, had, changed, his, mind, and, was, going, to, do, diddley, daddy, after, several, attempts, to, get, him, to, change, his, mind, cbs, brass, went, into, a, hurried, conference, in, attempt, to, synchronize, the, timing, of, the, show, with, the, longer, number, sullivan, was, enraged, you, re, the, first, black, boy, that, ever, double, crossed, me, on, the, show, diddley, quoted, him, as, saying, we, didn, t, have, much, to, do, with, each, other, after, that, he, added, later, diddley, resented, that, elvis, presley, whom, he, accused, of, copying, his, revolutionary, style, and, beat, received, the, attention, and, accolades, on, sullivan, s, show, that, he, felt, were, rightfully, his, i, am, owed, he, said, and, i, never, got, paid, he, might, have, wrote, nachman, had, things, gone, smoother, with, sullivan, buddy, holly, and, the, crickets, first, appeared, on, the, sullivan, show, in, 1957, to, an, enthusiastic, response, for, their, second, appearance, in, january, 1958, sullivan, considered, the, lyrics, of, their, chosen, number, oh, boy, too, suggestive, and, ordered, holly, to, substitute, another, song, holly, responded, that, he, had, already, told, his, hometown, friends, in, texas, that, he, would, be, singing, oh, boy, for, them, sullivan, unaccustomed, to, having, his, instructions, questioned, angrily, repeated, them, but, holly, refused, to, back, down, later, when, the, band, was, slow, to, respond, to, a, summons, to, the, rehearsal, stage, sullivan, commented, i, guess, the, crickets, are, not, too, excited, to, be, on, the, ed, sullivan, show, holly, still, annoyed, by, sullivan, s, attitude, replied, i, hope, they, re, damn, more, excited, than, i, am, sullivan, retaliated, by, cutting, them, from, two, numbers, to, one, then, mispronounced, holly, s, name, during, the, introduction, he, also, saw, to, it, that, holly, s, guitar, amplifier, volume, was, barely, audible, except, during, his, guitar, solo, nevertheless, the, band, was, so, well, received, that, sullivan, was, forced, to, invite, them, back, holly, responded, that, sullivan, did, not, have, enough, money, archival, photographs, taken, during, the, appearance, show, holly, smirking, and, ignoring, a, visibly, angry, sullivan, during, jackie, mason, s, october, 1964, performance, on, a, show, that, had, been, shortened, by, ten, minutes, due, to, an, address, by, president, lyndon, johnson, sullivan, on, stage, but, off, camera, signaled, mason, that, he, had, two, minutes, left, by, holding, up, two, fingers, sullivan, s, signal, distracted, the, studio, audience, and, to, television, viewers, unaware, of, the, circumstances, it, seemed, as, though, mason, s, jokes, were, falling, flat, mason, in, a, bid, to, regain, the, audience, s, attention, cried, i, m, getting, fingers, here, and, made, his, own, frantic, hand, gesture, here, s, a, finger, for, you, videotapes, of, the, incident, are, inconclusive, as, to, whether, mason, s, upswept, hand, which, was, just, off, camera, was, intended, to, be, an, indecent, gesture, but, sullivan, was, convinced, that, it, was, and, banned, mason, from, future, appearances, on, the, program, mason, later, said, that, he, did, not, know, what, the, middle, finger, meant, and, that, he, did, not, make, the, gesture, anyway, in, september, 1965, sullivan, who, according, to, mason, was, deeply, apologetic, brought, mason, on, the, show, for, a, surprise, grand, reunion, he, said, they, were, old, pals, nachman, wrote, news, to, mason, who, never, got, a, repeat, invitation, mason, added, that, his, earning, power, was, cut, right, in, half, after, that, i, never, really, worked, my, way, back, until, i, opened, on, broadway, in, 1986, when, the, byrds, performed, on, december, 12, 1965, david, crosby, got, into, a, shouting, match, with, the, show, s, director, they, were, never, asked, to, return, sullivan, decided, that, girl, we, couldn, t, get, much, higher, from, the, doors, signature, song, light, my, fire, was, too, overt, a, reference, to, drug, use, and, directed, that, the, lyric, be, changed, to, girl, we, couldn, t, get, much, better, for, the, group, s, september, 1967, appearance, the, band, members, nodded, their, assent, according, to, doors, biographer, ben, fong, torres, then, sang, the, song, as, written, after, the, broadcast, producer, bob, precht, told, the, group, mr, sullivan, wanted, you, for, six, more, shows, but, you, ll, never, work, the, ed, sullivan, show, again, jim, morrison, replied, hey, man, we, just, did, the, ed, sullivan, show, the, rolling, stones, famously, capitulated, during, their, fifth, appearance, on, the, show, in, 1967, when, mick, jagger, was, told, to, change, the, titular, lyric, of, let, s, spend, the, night, together, to, let, s, spend, some, time, together, but, jagger, prevailed, wrote, nachman, by, deliberately, calling, attention, to, the, censorship, rolling, his, eyes, mugging, and, drawing, out, the, word, t, i, i, i, me, as, he, sang, the, revised, lyric, sullivan, was, angered, by, the, insubordination, but, the, stones, did, make, one, additional, appearance, on, the, show, in, 1969, moe, howard, of, the, three, stooges, recalled, in, 1975, that, sullivan, had, a, memory, problem, of, sorts, ed, was, a, very, nice, man, but, for, a, showman, quite, forgetful, on, our, first, appearance, he, introduced, us, as, the, three, ritz, brothers, he, got, out, of, it, by, adding, who, look, more, like, the, three, stooges, to, me, joe, derita, who, worked, with, the, stooges, after, 1959, had, commented, that, sullivan, had, a, personality, like, the, bottom, of, a, bird, cage, diana, ross, who, was, very, fond, of, sullivan, later, recalled, sullivan, s, forgetfulness, during, the, many, occasions, the, supremes, performed, on, his, show, in, a, 1995, appearance, on, the, late, show, with, david, letterman, taped, in, the, ed, sullivan, theater, ross, stated, he, could, never, remember, our, names, he, called, us, the, girls, in, a, 1990, press, conference, paul, mccartney, recalled, meeting, sullivan, again, in, the, early, 1970s, sullivan, apparently, had, no, idea, who, mccartney, was, mccartney, tried, to, remind, sullivan, that, he, was, one, of, the, beatles, but, sullivan, obviously, could, not, remember, and, nodding, and, smiling, simply, shook, mccartney, s, hand, and, left, in, an, interview, with, howard, stern, around, 2012, joan, rivers, said, that, sullivan, had, been, suffering, from, dementia, toward, the, end, of, his, life, sullivan, like, many, american, entertainers, was, pulled, into, the, cold, war, anticommunism, of, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, tap, dancer, paul,

branding, draper, a, communist, party, sympathizer, she, demanded, that, sullivan, s, lead, sponsor, the, ford, motor, company, cancel, draper, s, appearance, draper, denied, the, charge, and, appeared, on, the, show, as, scheduled, ford, received, over, a, thousand, angry, letters, and, telegrams, and, sullivan, was, obliged, to, promise, ford, s, advertising, agency, kenyon, eckhardt, that, he, would, avoid, controversial, guests, going, forward, draper, was, forced, to, move, to, europe, to, earn, a, living, after, the, draper, incident, sullivan, began, to, work, closely, with,
