andries, van, wezel, 31, december, 1514, 15, october, 1564, latinised, as, andreas, vesalius, v, s, e, l, i, s, was, an, anatomist, and, physician, who, wrote, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, libri, septem, on, the, fabric, of, the, human, body, in, seven, books, which, is, considered, one, of, the, most, influential, books, on, human, anatomy, and, a, major, advance, over, the, long, dominant, work, of, galen, vesalius, is, often, referred, to, as, the, founder, of, modern, human, anatomy, he, was, born, in, brussels, which, was, then, part, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, he, was, a, professor, at, the, university, of, padua, 1537, 1542, and, later, became, imperial, physician, at, the, court, of, emperor, charles, v, vesalius, was, born, as, andries, van, wesel, to, his, father, anders, van, wesel, and, mother, isabel, crabbe, on, 31, december, 1514, in, brussels, which, was, then, part, of, the, habsburg, netherlands, his, great, grandfather, jan, van, wesel, probably, born, in, wesel, received, a, medical, degree, from, the, university, of, pavia, and, taught, medicine, at, the, university, of, leuven, his, grandfather, everard, van, wesel, was, the, royal, physician, of, emperor, maximilian, whilst, his, father, anders, van, wesel, served, as, apothecary, to, maximilian, and, later, valet, de, chambre, to, his, successor, charles, v, anders, encouraged, his, son, to, continue, in, the, family, tradition, and, enrolled, him, in, the, brethren, of, the, common, life, in, brussels, to, learn, greek, and, latin, prior, to, learning, medicine, according, to, standards, of, the, era, in, 1528, vesalius, entered, the, university, of, leuven, pedagogium, castrense, taking, arts, but, when, his, father, was, appointed, as, the, valet, de, chambre, in, 1532, he, decided, instead, to, pursue, a, career, in, medicine, at, the, university, of, paris, where, he, moved, in, 1533, there, he, studied, the, theories, of, galen, under, the, auspices, of, johann, winter, von, andernach, jacques, dubois, jacobus, sylvius, and, jean, fernel, it, was, during, that, time, that, he, developed, an, interest, in, anatomy, and, was, often, found, examining, excavated, bones, in, the, charnel, houses, at, the, cemetery, of, the, innocents, he, is, said, to, have, constructed, his, first, skeleton, by, stealing, from, a, gibbet, vesalius, was, forced, to, leave, paris, in, 1536, owing, to, the, opening, of, hostilities, between, the, holy, roman, empire, and, france, and, returned, to, the, university, of, leuven, he, completed, his, studies, there, and, graduated, the, following, year, his, doctoral, thesis, paraphrasis, in, nonum, librum, rhazae, medici, arabis, clarissimi, ad, regem, almansorem, de, affectuum, singularum, corporis, partium, curatione, was, a, commentary, on, the, ninth, book, of, rhazes, on, the, day, of, his, graduation, he, was, immediately, offered, the, chair, of, surgery, and, anatomy, explicator, chirurgiae, at, the, university, of, padua, he, also, guest, lectured, at, the, university, of, bologna, and, the, university, of, pisa, prior, to, taking, up, his, position, in, padua, vesalius, traveled, through, italy, and, assisted, the, future, pope, paul, iv, and, ignatius, of, loyola, to, heal, those, afflicted, by, leprosy, in, venice, he, met, the, illustrator, johan, van, calcar, a, student, of, titian, it, was, with, van, calcar, that, vesalius, published, his, first, anatomical, text, tabulae, anatomicae, sex, in, 1538, previously, these, topics, had, been, taught, primarily, from, reading, classical, texts, mainly, galen, followed, by, an, animal, dissection, by, a, barber, surgeon, whose, work, was, directed, by, the, lecturer, no, attempt, was, made, to, confirm, galen, s, claims, which, were, considered, unassailable, vesalius, in, contrast, performed, dissection, as, the, primary, teaching, tool, handling, the, actual, work, himself, and, urging, students, to, perform, dissection, themselves, he, considered, hands, on, direct, observation, to, be, the, only, reliable, resource, vesalius, created, detailed, illustrations, of, anatomy, for, students, in, the, form, of, six, large, woodcut, posters, when, he, found, that, some, of, them, were, being, widely, copied, he, published, them, all, in, 1538, under, the, title, tabulae, anatomicae, sex, he, followed, this, in, 1539, with, an, updated, version, of, winter, s, anatomical, handbook, institutiones, anatomicae, in, 1539, he, also, published, his, venesection, epistle, on, bloodletting, this, was, a, popular, treatment, for, almost, any, illness, but, there, was, some, debate, about, where, to, take, the, blood, from, the, classical, greek, procedure, advocated, by, galen, was, to, collect, blood, from, a, site, near, the, location, of, the, illness, however, the, muslim, and, medieval, practice, was, to, draw, a, smaller, amount, of, blood, from, a, distant, location, vesalius, pamphlet, generally, supported, galen, s, view, but, with, qualifications, that, rejected, the, infiltration, of, galen, in, bologna, vesalius, discovered, that, all, of, galen, s, research, was, restricted, to, animals, since, the, tradition, of, rome, did, not, allow, dissection, of, the, human, body, galen, had, dissected, barbary, macaques, instead, which, he, considered, structurally, closest, to, man, even, though, galen, was, a, qualified, examiner, his, research, produced, many, errors, owing, to, the, limited, anatomical, material, available, to, him, vesalius, contributed, to, the, new, giunta, edition, of, galen, s, collected, works, and, began, to, write, his, own, anatomical, text, based, on, his, own, research, until, vesalius, pointed, out, galen, s, substitution, of, animal, for, human, anatomy, it, had, gone, unnoticed, and, had, long, been, the, basis, of, studying, human, anatomy, unlike, galen, vesalius, was, able, to, procure, a, steady, supply, of, human, cadavers, for, dissection, in, 1539, a, judge, at, the, padua, criminal, court, had, been, interested, by, vesalius, work, and, had, agreed, to, regularly, supply, him, the, cadavers, of, executed, criminals, galen, had, assumed, that, arteries, carried, the, purest, blood, to, higher, organs, such, as, the, brain, and, lungs, from, the, left, ventricle, of, the, heart, while, veins, carried, blood, to, the, lesser, organs, such, as, the, stomach, from, the, right, ventricle, in, order, for, this, theory, to, be, correct, some, kind, of, opening, was, needed, to, interconnect, the, ventricles, and, galen, claimed, to, have, found, them, so, paramount, was, galen, s, authority, that, for, 1400, years, a, succession, of, anatomists, had, claimed, to, find, these, holes, until, vesalius, admitted, he, could, not, find, them, nonetheless, he, did, not, venture, to, dispute, galen, on, the, distribution, of, blood, being, unable, to, offer, any, other, solution, and, so, supposed, that, it, diffused, through, the, unbroken, partition, between, the, ventricles, other, famous, examples, of, vesalius, disproving, galen, s, assertions, were, his, discoveries, that, the, lower, jaw, mandible, was, composed, of, only, one, bone, not, two, which, galen, had, assumed, based, on, animal, dissection, and, that, humans, lack, the, rete, mirabile, a, network, of, blood, vessels, at, the, base, of, the, brain, that, is, found, in, sheep, and, other, ungulates, in, 1543, vesalius, conducted, a, public, dissection, of, the, body, of, jakob, karrer, von, gebweiler, a, notorious, felon, from, the, city, of, basel, switzerland, he, assembled, and, articulated, the, bones, finally, donating, the, skeleton, to, the, university, of, basel, this, preparation, the, basel, skeleton, is, vesalius, only, well, preserved, skeletal, preparation, and, also, the, world, s, oldest, surviving, anatomical, preparation, it, is, still, displayed, at, the, anatomical, museum, of, the, university, of, basel, in, the, same, year, vesalius, took, residence, in, basel, to, help, johannes, oporinus, publish, the, seven, volume, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, on, the, fabric, of, the, human, body, a, groundbreaking, work, of, human, anatomy, that, he, dedicated, to, charles, v, many, believe, it, was, illustrated, by, titian, s, pupil, jan, stephen, van, calcar, but, evidence, is, lacking, and, it, is, unlikely, that, a, single, artist, created, all, 273, illustrations, in, a, period, of, time, so, short, at, about, the, same, time, he, published, an, abridged, edition, for, students, andrea, vesalii, suorum, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, librorum, epitome, and, dedicated, it, to, philip, ii, of, spain, the, son, of, the, emperor, that, work, now, collectively, referred, to, as, the, fabrica, of, vesalius, was, groundbreaking, in, the, history, of, medical, publishing, and, is, considered, to, be, a, major, step, in, the, development, of, scientific, medicine, because, of, this, it, marks, the, establishment, of, anatomy, as, a, modern, descriptive, science, though, vesalius, work, was, not, the, first, such, work, based, on, actual, dissection, nor, even, the, first, work, of, this, era, the, production, quality, highly, detailed, and, intricate, plates, and, the, likelihood, that, the, artists, who, produced, it, were, clearly, present, in, person, at, the, dissections, made, it, an, instant, classic, pirated, editions, were, available, almost, immediately, an, event, vesalius, acknowledged, in, a, printer, s, note, would, happen, vesalius, was, 28, years, old, when, the, first, edition, of, fabrica, was, published, soon, after, publication, vesalius, was, invited, to, become, imperial, physician, to, the, court, of, emperor, charles, v, he, informed, the, venetian, senate, that, he, would, leave, his, post, at, padua, which, prompted, duke, cosimo, i, de, medici, to, invite, him, to, move, to, the, expanding, university, in, pisa, which, he, declined, vesalius, took, up, the, offered, position, in, the, imperial, court, where, he, had, to, deal, with, other, physicians, who, mocked, him, for, being, a, mere, barber, surgeon, instead, of, an, academic, working, on, the, respected, basis, of, theory, in, the, 1540s, shortly, after, entering, in, service, of, the, emperor, vesalius, married, anne, van, hamme, from, vilvorde, belgium, they, had, one, daughter, named, anne, who, died, in, 1588, over, the, next, eleven, years, vesalius, traveled, with, the, court, treating, injuries, caused, in, battle, or, tournaments, performing, postmortems, administering, medication, and, writing, private, letters, addressing, specific, medical, questions, during, these, years, he, also, wrote, the, epistle, on, the, china, root, a, short, text, on, the, properties, of, a, medical, plant, whose, efficacy, he, doubted, as, well, as, a, defense, of, his, anatomical, findings, this, elicited, a, new, round, of, attacks, on, his, work, that, called, for, him, to, be, punished, by, the, emperor, in, 1551, charles, v, commissioned, an, inquiry, in, salamanca, to, investigate, the, religious, implications, of, his, methods, although, vesalius, work, was, cleared, by, the, board, the, attacks, continued, four, years, later, one, of, his, main, detractors, and, one, time, professors, jacobus, sylvius, published, an, article, that, claimed, that, the, human, body, itself, had, changed, since, galen, had, studied, it, in, 1555, vesalius, became, physician, to, philip, ii, and, in, the, same, year, he, published, a, revised, edition, of, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, in, 1564, vesalius, went, on, a, pilgrimage, to, the, holy, land, some, said, in, penance, after, being, accused, of, dissecting, a, living, body, he, sailed, with, the, venetian, fleet, under, james, malatesta, via, cyprus, when, he, reached, jerusalem, he, received, a, message, from, the, venetian, senate, requesting, him, again, to, accept, the, paduan, professorship, which, had, become, vacant, on, the, death, of, contemporary, fallopius, after, struggling, for, many, days, with, adverse, winds, in, the, ionian, sea, he, was, shipwrecked, on, the, island, of, zakynthos, here, he, soon, died, in, such, debt, that, a, benefactor, kindly, paid, for, his, funeral, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, 49, years, old, he, was, buried, somewhere, on, the, island, of, zakynthos, zante, for, some, time, it, was, assumed, that, vesalius, s, pilgrimage, was, due, to, the, pressures, imposed, on, him, by, the, inquisition, today, this, assumption, is, generally, considered, to, be, without, foundation, and, is, dismissed, by, modern, biographers, it, appears, the, story, was, spread, by, hubert, languet, a, diplomat, under, emperor, charles, v, and, then, under, the, prince, of, orange, who, claimed, in, 1565, that, vesalius, had, performed, an, autopsy, on, an, aristocrat, in, spain, while, the, heart, was, still, beating, leading, to, the, inquisition, s, condemning, him, to, death, the, story, went, on, to, claim, that, philip, ii, had, the, sentence, commuted, to, a, pilgrimage, that, story, re, surfaced, several, times, until, it, was, more, recently, revised, the, decision, to, undertake, the, pilgrimage, was, likely, just, a, pretext, to, leave, the, spanish, court, its, lifestyle, did, not, please, him, and, he, longed, to, continue, his, research, given, that, he, could, not, get, rid, of, his, royal, service, by, resignation, he, managed, to, escape, asking, for, the, permission, to, go, to, jerusalem, in, 1543, vesalius, asked, johannes, oporinus, to, publish, the, book, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, libri, septem, on, the, fabric, of, the, human, body, in, seven, books, a, groundbreaking, work, of, human, anatomy, he, dedicated, to, charles, v, and, which, many, believe, was, illustrated, by, titian, s, pupil, jan, stephen, van, calcar, about, the, same, time, he, published, another, version, of, his, great, work, entitled, de, humani, corporis, fabrica, librorum, epitome, abridgement, of, the, on, the, fabric, of, the, human, body, more, commonly, known, as, the, epitome, with, a, stronger, focus, on, illustrations, than, on, text, so, as, to, help, readers, including, medical, students, to, easily, understand, his, findings, the, actual, text, of, the, epitome, was, an, abridged, form, of, his, work, in, the, fabrica, and, the, organization, of, the, two, books, was, quite, varied, he, dedicated, it, to, philip, ii, of, spain, son, of, the, emperor, the, fabrica, emphasized, the, priority, of, dissection, and, what, has, come, to, be, called, the, anatomical, view, of, the, body, seeing, human, internal, functioning, as, a, result, of, an, essentially, corporeal, structure, filled, with, organs, arranged, in, three, dimensional, space, his, book, contains, drawings, of, several, organs, on, two, leaves, this, allows, for, the, creation, of, three, dimensional, diagrams, by, cutting, out, the, organs, and, pasting, them, on, flayed, figures, this, was, in, stark, contrast, to, many, of, the, anatomical, models, used, previously, which, had, strong, galenic, aristotelean, elements, as, well, as, elements, of, astrology, although, modern, anatomical, texts, had, been, published, by, mondino, and, berenger, much, of, their, work, was, clouded, by, reverence, for, galen, and, arabian, doctrines, besides, the, first, good, description, of, the, sphenoid, bone, he, showed, that, the, sternum, consists, of, three, portions, and, the, sacrum, of, five, or, six, and, described, accurately, the, vestibule, in, the, interior, of, the, temporal, bone, he, not, only, verified, estienne, s, observations, on, the, valves, of, the, hepatic, veins, but, also, described, the, vena, azygos, and, discovered, the, canal, which, passes, in, the, fetus, between, the, umbilical, vein, and, the, vena, cava, since, named, the, ductus, venosus, he, described, the, omentum, and, its, connections, with, the, stomach, the, spleen, and, the, colon, gave, the, first, correct, views, of, the, structure, of, the, pylorus, observed, the, small, size, of, the, caecal, appendix, in, man, gave, the, first, good, account, of, the, mediastinum, and, pleura, and, the, fullest, description, of, the, anatomy, of, the, brain, up, to, that, time, he, did, not, understand, the, inferior, recesses, and, his, account, of, the, nerves, is, confused, by, regarding, the, optic, as, the, first, pair, the, third, as, the, fifth, and, the, fifth, as, the, seventh, in, this, work, vesalius, also, becomes, the, first, person, to, describe, mechanical, ventilation, it, is, largely, this, achievement, that, has, resulted, in, vesalius, being, incorporated, into, the, australian, and, new, zealand, college, of, anaesthetists, college, arms, and, crest, when, i, undertake, the, dissection, of, a, human, pelvis, i, pass, a, stout, rope, tied, like, a, noose, beneath, the, lower, jaw, and, through, the, zygomas, up, to, the, top, of, the, head, the, lower, end, of, the, noose, i, run, through, a, pulley, fixed, to, a, beam, in, the, room, so, that, i, may, raise, or, lower, the, cadaver, as, it, hangs, there, or, turn, around, in, any, direction, to, suit, my, purpose, you, must, take, care, not, to, put, the, noose, around, the, neck, unless, some, of, the, muscles, connected, to, the, occipital, bone, have, already, been, cut, away, in, 1538, vesalius, wrote, epistola, docens, venam, axillarem, dextri, cubiti, in, dolore, laterali, secandam, a, letter, teaching, that, in, cases, of, pain, in, the, side, the, axillary, vein, of, the, right, elbow, be, cut, commonly, known, as, the, venesection, letter, which, demonstrated, a, revived, venesection, a, classical, procedure, in, which, blood, was, drawn, near, the, site, of, the, ailment, he, sought, to, locate, the, precise, site, for, venesection, in, pleurisy, within, the, framework, of, the, classical, method, the, real, significance, of, the, book, is, his, attempt, to, support, his, arguments, by, the, location, and, continuity, of, the, venous, system, from, his, observations, rather, than, appeal, to, earlier, published, works, with, this, novel, approach, to, the, problem, of, venesection, vesalius, posed, the, then, striking, hypothesis, that, anatomical, dissection, might, be, used, to, test, speculation, in, 1546, three, years, after, the, fabrica, he, wrote, his, epistola, rationem, modumque, propinandi, radicis, chynae, decocti, commonly, known, as, the, epistle, on, the, china, root, ostensibly, an, appraisal, of, a, popular, but, ineffective, treatment, for, gout, syphilis, and, stones, this, work, is, especially, important, as, a, continued, polemic, against, galenism, and, a, reply, to, critics, in, the, camp, of, his, former, professor, jacobus, sylvius, now, an, obsessive, detractor, in, february, 1561, vesalius, was, given, a, copy, of, gabriele, fallopio, s, observationes, anatomicae, friendly, additions, and, corrections, to, the, fabrica, before, the, end, of, the, year, vesalius, composed, a, cordial, reply, anatomicarum, gabrielis, fallopii, observationum, examen, generally, referred, to, as, the, examen, in, this, work, he, recognizes, in, fallopio, a, true, equal, in, the, science, of, dissection, he, had, done, so, much, to, create, vesalius, reply, to, fallopio, was, published, in, may, 1564, a, month, after, vesalius, death, on, the, greek, island, of, zante, now, called, zakynthos, the, influence, of, vesalius, plates, representing, the, partial, dissections, of, the, human, figure, posing, in, a, landscape, setting, is, apparent, in, the, anatomical, plates, prepared, by, the, baroque, painter, pietro, da, cortona, 1596, 1669, who, executed, anatomical, plates, with, figures, in, dramatic, poses, most, of, them, with, architectural, or, landscape, backdrops, in, 1844, botanists, martin, martens, and, henri, guillaume, galeotti, published, vesalea, which, is, a, plant, genus, in, the, honeysuckle, family, caprifoliaceae, and, it, was, named, in, vesalius, s, honour
