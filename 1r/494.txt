melodies, their, growing, interest, in, folk, music, coincided, with, a, contemporary, social, interest, in, traditional, national, culture, magyar, folk, music, had, previously, been, categorised, as, gypsy, music, the, classic, example, is, franz, liszt, s, hungarian, rhapsodies, for, piano, which, he, based, on, popular, art, songs, performed, by, romani, bands, of, the, time, in, contrast, bart, k, and, kod, ly, discovered, that, the, old, magyar, folk, melodies, were, based, on, pentatonic, scales, similar, to, those, in, asian, folk, traditions, such, as, those, of, central, asia, anatolia, and, siberia, bart, k, and, kod, ly, set, about, incorporating, elements, of, such, magyar, peasant, music, into, their, compositions, they, both, frequently, quoted, folk, song, melodies, verbatim, and, wrote, pieces, derived, entirely, from, authentic, songs, an, example, is, bartok, s, two, volumes, entitled, for, children, for, solo, piano, containing, 80, folk, tunes, to, which, he, wrote, accompaniment, bart, k, s, style, in, his, art, music, compositions, was, a, synthesis, of, folk, music, classicism, and, modernism, his, melodic, and, harmonic, sense, was, influenced, by, the, folk, music, of, hungary, romania, and, other, nations, he, was, especially, fond, of, the, asymmetrical, dance, rhythms, and, pungent, harmonies, found, in, bulgarian, music, most, of, his, early, compositions, offer, a, blend, of, nationalist, and, late, romanticism, elements, in, 1909, at, the, age, of, 28, bart, k, married, m, rta, ziegler, 1893, 1967, aged, 16, their, son, b, la, bart, k, iii, was, born, the, next, year, after, nearly, 15, years, together, bart, k, divorced, m, rta, in, june, 1923, two, months, after, his, divorce, he, married, ditta, p, sztory, 1903, 1982, a,

atheist, he, later, became, attracted, to, unitarianism, and, publicly, converted, to, the, unitarian, faith, in, 1916, although, bart, k, was, not, conventionally, religious, according, to, his, son, b, la, bart, k, iii, he, was, a, nature, lover, he, always, mentioned, the, miraculous, order, of, nature, with, great, reverence, as, an, adult, b, la, iii, later, became, lay, president, of, the, hungarian, unitarian, church, in, 1911, bart, k, wrote, what, was, to, be, his, only, opera, bluebeard, s, castle, dedicated, to, m, rta, he, entered, it, for, a, prize, by, the, hungarian, fine, arts, commission, but, they, rejected, his, work, as, not, fit, for, the, stage, in, 1917, bart, k, revised, the, score, for, the, 1918, premi, re, and, rewrote, the, ending, following, the, 1919, revolution, in, which, he, actively, participated, he, was, pressured, by, the, horthy, regime, to, remove, the, name, of, librettist, b, la, bal, zs, from, the, opera, as, bal, zs, was, of, jewish, origin, was, blacklisted, and, had, left, the, country, for, vienna, bluebeard, s, castle, received, only, one, revival, in, 1936, before, bart, k, emigrated, for, the, remainder, of, his, life, although, devoted, to, hungary, its, people, and, its, culture, he, never, felt, much, loyalty, to, the, government, or, its, official, establishments, after, his, disappointment, over, the, fine, arts, commission, competition, bart, k, wrote, little, for, two, or, three, years, preferring, to, concentrate, on, collecting, and, arranging, folk, music, he, found, the, phonograph, an, essential, tool, for, collecting, folk, music, for, its, accuracy, objectivity, and, manipulability, he, collected, first, in, the, carpathian, basin, then, the, kingdom, of, hungary, where, he, notated, hungarian, slovak, romanian, and, bulgarian, folk, music, the, developmental, breakthrough, for, bartok, arrived, when, he, collaboratively, collected, folk, music, with, zolt, n, kod, ly, through, the, medium, of, an, edison, machine, on, which, they, would, study, classification, possibilities, for, individual, folk, songs, and, record, hundreds, of, cylinders, bartok, s, compositional, command, of, folk, elements, is, expressed, in, such, an, authentic, and, undiluted, a, manner, because, of, the, scales, sounds, and, rhythms, that, were, so, much, a, part, of, his, native, hungary, that, he, automatically, saw, music, in, these, terms, he, also, collected, in, moldavia, wallachia, and, in, 1913, algeria, the, outbreak, of, world, war, i, forced, him, to, stop, the, expeditions, but, he, returned, to, composing, with, a, ballet, called, the, wooden, prince, 1914, 1916, and, the, string, quartet, no, 2, in, 1915, 1917, both, influenced, by, debussy, bart, k, s, libretto, for, the, miraculous, mandarin, another, ballet, was, influenced, by, igor, stravinsky, arnold, schoenberg, and, richard, strauss, though, started, in, 1918, the, story, s, sexual, content, kept, it, from, being, performed, until, 1926, he, next, wrote, his, two, violin, sonatas, written, in, 1921, and, 1922, respectively, which, are, among, his, most, harmonically, and, structurally, complex, pieces, in, march, 1927, he, visited, barcelona, and, performed, the, rhapsody, for, piano, sz, 26, with, the, orquestra, pau, casals, at, the, gran, teatre, del, liceu, during, the, same, stay, he, attended, a, concert, by, the, cobla, barcelona, at, the, palau, de, la, m, sica, catalana, according, to, the, critic, joan, llongueras, he, was, very, interested, in, the, sardanas, above, all, the, freshness, spontaneity, and, life, of, our, music, he, wanted, to, know, the, mechanism, of, the, tenoras, and, the, tibles, and, requested, data, on, the, composition, of, the, cobla, and, extension, and, characteristics, of, each, instrument, in, 1927, 1928, bart, k, wrote, his, third, and, fourth, string, quartets, after, which, his, compositions, demonstrated, his, mature, style, notable, examples, of, this, period, are, music, for, strings, percussion, and, celesta, 1936, and, divertimento, for, string, orchestra, 1939, the, fifth, string, quartet, was, composed, in, 1934, and, the, sixth, string, quartet, his, last, in, 1939, in, 1936, he, travelled, to, turkey, to, collect, and, study, turkish, folk, music, he, worked, in, collaboration, with, turkish, composer, ahmet, adnan, saygun, mostly, around, adana, in, 1940, as, the, european, political, situation, worsened, after, the, outbreak, of, world, war, ii, bart, k, was, increasingly, tempted, to, flee, hungary, he, strongly, opposed, the, nazis, and, hungary, s, alliance, with, germany, and, the, axis, powers, under, the, tripartite, pact, after, the, nazis, came, to, power, in, 1933, bart, k, refused, to, give, concerts, in, germany, and, broke, away, from, his, publisher, there, his, anti, fascist, political, views, caused, him, a, great, deal, of, trouble, with, the, establishment, in, hungary, in, his, will, recorded, on, 4, october, 1940, he, requested, that, no, square, or, street, be, named, after, him, until, the, budapest, squares, oktogon, and, kod, ly, k, r, nd, or, in, fact, any, square, or, street, in, hungary, no, longer, bear, the, names, of, mussolini, and, hitler, as, they, did, at, the, time, he, wrote, his, will, having, first, sent, his, manuscripts, out, of, the, country, bart, k, reluctantly, emigrated, to, the, u, s, with, his, wife, ditta, p, sztory, in, october, 1940, they, settled, in, new, york, city, after, arriving, on, the, night, of, 29, 30, october, by, a, steamer, from, lisbon, after, joining, them, in, 1942, their, younger, son, p, ter, bart, k, enlisted, in, the, united, states, navy, where, he, served, in, the, pacific, during, the, remainder, of, the, war, and, later, settled, in, florida, where, he, became, a, recording, and, sound, engineer, his, elder, son, by, his, first, marriage, b, la, bart, k, iii, remained, in, hungary, and, later, worked, as, a, railroad, official, until, his, retirement, in, the, early, 1980s, although, he, became, an, american, citizen, in, 1945, shortly, before, his, death, bart, k, never, felt, fully, at, home, in, the, united, states, he, initially, found, it, difficult, to, compose, although, he, was, well, known, in, america, as, a, pianist, ethnomusicologist, and, teacher, he, was, not, well, known, as, a, composer, there, was, little, american, interest, in, his, music, during, his, final, years, he, and, his, wife, ditta, gave, some, concerts, although, demand, for, them, was, low, bart, k, who, had, made, some, recordings, in, hungary, also, recorded, for, columbia, records, after, he, came, to, the, us, many, of, these, recordings, some, with, bart, k, s, own, spoken, introductions, were, later, issued, on, lp, and, cd, supported, by, a, research, fellowship, from, columbia, university, for, several, years, bart, k, and, ditta, worked, on, a, large, collection, of, serbian, and, croatian, folk, songs, in, columbia, s, libraries, bart, k, s, economic, difficulties, during, his, first, years, in, america, were, mitigated, by, publication, royalties, teaching, and, performance, tours, while, his, finances, were, always, precarious, he, did, not, live, and, die, in, poverty, as, was, the, common, myth, he, had, enough, friends, and, supporters, to, ensure, that, there, was, sufficient, money, and, work, available, for, him, to, live, on, bart, k, was, a, proud, man, and, did, not, easily, accept, charity, despite, being, short, on, cash, at, times, he, often, refused, money, that, his, friends, offered, him, out, of, their, own, pockets, although, he, was, not, a, member, of, the, ascap, the, society, paid, for, any, medical, care, he, needed, during, his, last, two, years, to, which, bart, k, reluctantly, agreed, the, first, symptoms, of, his, health, problems, began, late, in, 1940, when, his, right, shoulder, began, to, show, signs, of, stiffening, in, 1942, symptoms, increased, and, he, started, having, bouts, of, fever, bart, k, s, illness, was, at, first, thought, to, be, a, recurrence, of, the, tuberculosis, he, had, experienced, as, a, young, man, and, one, of, his, doctors, in, new, york, was, edgar, mayer, director, of, will, rogers, memorial, hospital, in, saranac, lake, but, medical, examinations, found, no, underlying, disease, finally, in, april, 1944, leukemia, was, diagnosed, but, by, this, time, little, could, be, done, as, his, body, slowly, failed, bart, k, found, more, creative, energy, and, produced, a, final, set, of, masterpieces, partly, thanks, to, the, violinist, joseph, szigeti, and, the, conductor, fritz, reiner, reiner, had, been, bart, k, s, friend, and, champion, since, his, days, as, bart, k, s, student, at, the, royal, academy, bart, k, s, last, work, might, well, have, been, the, string, quartet, no, 6, but, for, serge, koussevitzky, s, commission, for, the, concerto, for, orchestra, koussevitsky, s, boston, symphony, orchestra, premiered, the, work, in, december, 1944, to, highly, positive, reviews, the, concerto, for, orchestra, quickly, became, bart, k, s, most, popular, work, although, he, did, not, live, to, see, its, full, impact, in, 1944, he, was, also, commissioned, by, yehudi, menuhin, to, write, a, sonata, for, solo, violin, in, 1945, bart, k, composed, his, piano, concerto, no, 3, a, graceful, and, almost, neo, classical, work, as, a, surprise, 42nd, birthday, present, for, ditta, but, he, died, just, over, a, month, before, her, birthday, with, the, scoring, not, quite, finished, he, had, also, sketched, his, viola, concerto, but, had, barely, started, the, scoring, at, his, death, leaving, completed, only, the, viola, part, and, sketches, of, the, orchestral, part, b, la, bart, k, died, at, age, 64, in, a, hospital, in, new, york, city, from, complications, of, leukemia, specifically, of, secondary, polycythemia, on, 26, september, 1945, his, funeral, was, attended, by, only, ten, people, aside, from, his, widow, and, their, son, other, attendees, included, gy, rgy, s, ndor, bart, k, s, body, was, initially, interred, in, ferncliff, cemetery, in, hartsdale, new, york, during, the, final, year, of, communist, hungary, in, the, late, 1980s, the, hungarian, government, along, with, his, two, sons, b, la, iii, and, p, ter, requested, that, his, remains, be, exhumed, and, transferred, back, to, budapest, for, burial, where, hungary, arranged, a, state, funeral, for, him, on, 7, july, 1988, he, was, re, interred, at, budapest, s, farkasr, ti, cemetery, next, to, the, remains, of, ditta, who, died, in, 1982, one, year, after, what, would, have, been, b, la, bart, k, s, 100th, birthday, the, two, unfinished, works, were, later, completed, by, his, pupil, tibor, serly, gy, rgy, s, ndor, was, the, soloist, in, the, first, performance, of, the, third, piano, concerto, on, 8, february, 1946, ditta, p, sztory, bart, k, later, played, and, recorded, it, the, viola, concerto, was, revised, and, published, in, the, 1990s, by, bart, k, s, son, this, version, may, be, closer, to, what, bart, k, intended, concurrently, peter, bart, k, in, association, with, argentinian, musician, nelson, dellamaggiore, worked, to, reprint, and, revise, past, editions, of, the, third, piano, concerto, bart, k, s, music, reflects, two, trends, that, dramatically, changed, the, sound, of, music, in, the, 20th, century, the, breakdown, of, the, diatonic, system, of, harmony, that, had, served, composers, for, the, previous, two, hundred, years, and, the, revival, of, nationalism, as, a, source, for, musical, inspiration, a, trend, that, began, with, mikhail, glinka, and, anton, n, dvo, k, in, the, last, half, of, the, 19th, century, in, his, search, for, new, forms, of, tonality, bart, k, turned, to, hungarian, folk, music, as, well, as, to, other, folk, music, of, the, carpathian, basin, and, even, of, algeria, and, turkey, in, so, doing, he, became, influential, in, that, stream, of, modernism, which, used, indigenous, music, and, techniques, one, characteristic, style, of, music, is, his, night, music, which, he, used, mostly, in, slow, movements, of, multi, movement, ensemble, or, orchestral, compositions, in, his, mature, period, it, is, characterised, by, eerie, dissonances, providing, a, backdrop, to, sounds, of, nature, and, lonely, melodies, an, example, is, the, third, movement, adagio, of, his, music, for, strings, percussion, and, celesta, his, music, can, be, grouped, roughly, in, accordance, with, the, different, periods, in, his, life, the, works, of, bart, k, s, youth, were, written, in, a, classical, and, early, romantic, style, touched, with, influences, of, popular, and, romani, music, between, 1890, and, 1894, 9, to, 13, years, of, age, he, wrote, 31, piano, pieces, although, most, of, these, were, simple, dance, pieces, in, these, early, works, bart, k, began, to, tackle, some, more, advanced, forms, as, in, his, ten, part, programmatic, a, duna, foly, sa, the, course, of, the, danube, 1890, 1894, which, he, played, in, his, first, public, recital, in, 1892, in, catholic, grammar, school, bart, k, took, to, studying, the, scores, of, composers, from, bach, to, wagner, his, compositions, then, advancing, in, style, and, taking, on, similarities, to, schumann, and, brahms, following, his, matriculation, into, the, budapest, academy, in, 1890, he, composed, very, little, though, he, began, to, work, on, exercises, in, orchestration, and, familiarized, himself, thoroughly, with, the, operas, of, wagner, in, 1902, his, creative, energies, were, revitalized, by, the, discovery, of, the, music, of, richard, strauss, whose, tone, poem, also, sprach, zarathustra, according, to, bart, k, stimulated, the, greatest, enthusiasm, in, me, at, last, i, saw, the, way, that, lay, before, me, bart, k, also, owned, the, score, to, a, hero, s, life, which, he, transcribed, for, the, piano, and, committed, to, memory, under, the, influence, of, strauss, bart, k, composed, in, 1903, kossuth, a, symphonic, poem, in, ten, tableaux, on, the, subject, of, the, 1848, hungarian, war, of, independence, reflecting, the, composers, growing, interest, in, musical, nationalism, a, year, later, he, renewed, his, opus, numbers, with, the, rhapsody, for, piano, and, orchestra, serving, as, opus, 1, driven, by, nationalistic, fervor, and, a, desire, to, transcend, the, influence, of, prior, composers, bart, k, began, a, lifelong, devotion, to, folk, music, which, was, sparked, by, his, overhearing, nanny, lidi, d, sa, s, singing, of, transylvanian, folk, songs, at, a, hungarian, resort, in, 1904, bart, k, began, to, collect, magyar, peasant, melodies, later, extending, to, the, folk, music, of, other, peoples, of, the, carpathian, basin, slovaks, romanians, rusyns, serbs, and, croatians, his, compositional, output, would, gradually, prune, away, romantic, elements, in, favour, of, an, idiom, that, embodied, folk, music, as, intrinsic, and, essential, to, its, style, later, in, life, he, would, have, this, to, say, on, the, incorporation, of, folk, and, art, music, the, question, is, what, are, the, ways, in, which, peasant, music, is, taken, over, and, becomes, transmuted, into, modern, music, we, may, for, instance, take, over, a, peasant, melody, unchanged, or, only, slightly, varied, write, an, accompaniment, to, it, and, possibly, some, opening, and, concluding, phrases, this, kind, of, work, would, show, a, certain, analogy, with, bach, s, treatment, of, chorales, another, method, is, the, following, the, composer, does, not, make, use, of, a, real, peasant, melody, but, invents, his, own, imitation, of, such, melodies, there, is, no, true, difference, between, this, method, and, the, one, described, above, there, is, yet, a, third, way, neither, peasant, melodies, nor, imitations, of, peasant, melodies, can, be, found, in, his, music, but, it, is, pervaded, by, the, atmosphere, of, peasant, music, in, this, case, we, may, say, he, has, completely, absorbed, the, idiom, of, peasant, music, which, has, become, his, musical, mother, tongue, bart, k, became, first, acquainted, with, debussy, s, music, in, 1907, and, regarded, his, music, highly, in, an, interview, in, 1939, bart, k, said, debussy, s, great, service, to, music, was, to, reawaken, among, all, musicians, an, awareness, of, harmony, and, its, possibilities, in, that, he, was, just, as, important, as, beethoven, who, revealed, to, us, the, possibilities, of, progressive, form, or, as, bach, who, showed, us, the, transcendent, significance, of, counterpoint, now, what, i, am, always, asking, myself, is, this, is, it, possible, to, make, a, synthesis, of, these, three, great, masters, a, living, synthesis, that, will, be, valid, for, our, time, debussy, s, influence, is, present, in, the, fourteen, bagatelles, 1908, these, made, ferruccio, busoni, exclaim, at, last, something, truly, new, until, 1911, bart, k, composed, widely, differing, works, which, ranged, from, adherence, to, romantic, style, to, folk, song, arrangements, and, to, his, modernist, opera, bluebeard, s, castle, the, negative, reception, of, his, work, led, him, to, focus, on, folk, music, research, after, 1911, and, abandon, composition, with, the, exception, of, folk, music, arrangements, his, pessimistic, attitude, towards, composing, was, lifted, by, the, stormy, and, inspiring, contact, with, kl, ra, gombossy, in, the, summer, of, 1915, this, interesting, episode, in, bart, k, s, life, remained, hidden, until, it, was, researched, by, denijs, dille, between, 1979, and, 1989, bart, k, started, composing, again, including, the, suite, for, piano, opus, 14, 1916, and, the, miraculous, mandarin, 1919, and, he, completed, the, wooden, prince, 1917, bart, k, felt, the, result, of, world, war, i, as, a, personal, tragedy, many, regions, he, loved, were, severed, from, hungary, transylvania, the, banat, where, he, was, born, and, bratislava, pozsony, where, his, mother, had, lived, additionally, the, political, relations, between, hungary, and, other, successor, states, to, the, austro, hungarian, empire, prohibited, his, folk, music, research, outside, of, hungary, bart, k, also, wrote, the, noteworthy, eight, improvisations, on, hungarian, peasant, songs, in, 1920, and, the, sunny, dance, suite, in, 1923, the, year, of, his, second, marriage, in, 1926, bart, k, needed, a, significant, piece, for, piano, and, orchestra, with, which, he, could, tour, in, europe, and, america, he, was, particularly, inspired, by, american, composer, henry, cowell, s, controversial, use, of, intense, tone, clusters, on, the, piano, while, touring, western, europe, bart, k, happened, to, be, present, at, one, of, these, concerts, and, would, later, request, cowell, s, permission, to, use, his, technique, without, causing, offence, which, cowell, granted, in, the, preparation, for, writing, his, first, piano, concerto, he, wrote, his, sonata, out, of, doors, and, nine, little, pieces, all, for, solo, piano, and, all, of, which, prominently, utilize, clusters, he, increasingly, found, his, own, voice, in, his, maturity, the, style, of, his, last, period, named, synthesis, of, east, and, west, is, hard, to, define, let, alone, to, put, under, one, term, in, his, mature, period, bart, k, wrote, relatively, few, works, but, most, of, them, are, large, scale, compositions, for, large, settings, only, his, voice, works, have, programmatic, titles, and, his, late, works, often, adhere, to, classical, forms, among, bart, k, s, most, important, works, are, the, six, string, quartets, 1909, 1917, 1927, 1928, 1934, and, 1939, the, cantata, profana, 1930, which, bart, k, declared, was, the, work, he, felt, and, professed, to, be, his, most, personal, credo, the, music, for, strings, percussion, and, celesta, 1936, the, concerto, for, orchestra, 1943, and, the, third, piano, concerto, 1945, he, made, a, lasting, contribution, to, the, literature, for, younger, students, for, his, son, p, ter, s, music, lessons, he, composed, mikrokosmos, a, six, volume, collection, of, graded, piano, pieces, paul, wilson, lists, as, the, most, prominent, characteristics, of, bart, k, s, music, from, late, 1920s, onwards, the, influence, of, the, carpathian, basin, and, european, art, music, and, his, changing, attitude, toward, and, use, of, tonality, but, without, the, use, of, the, traditional, harmonic, functions, associated, with, major, and, minor, scales, although, bart, k, claimed, in, his, writings, that, his, music, was, always, tonal, he, rarely, used, the, chords, or, scales, normally, associated, with, tonality, and, so, the, descriptive, resources, of, tonal, theory, are, of, limited, use, george, perle, 1955, and, elliott, antokoletz, 1984, focus, on, his, alternative, methods, of, signaling, tonal, centers, via, axes, of, inversional, symmetry, others, view, bart, k, s, axes, of, symmetry, in, terms, of, atonal, analytic, protocols, richard, cohn, 1988, argues, that, inversional, symmetry, is, often, a, byproduct, of, another, atonal, procedure, the, formation, of, chords, from, transpositionally, related, dyads, atonal, pitch, class, theory, also, furnishes, resources, for, exploring, polymodal, chromaticism, projected, sets, privileged, patterns, and, large, set, types, used, as, source, sets, such, as, the, equal, tempered, twelve, tone, aggregate, octatonic, scale, and, alpha, chord, the, diatonic, and, heptatonia, secunda, seven, note, scales, and, less, often, the, whole, tone, scale, and, the, primary, pentatonic, collection, he, rarely, used, the, simple, aggregate, actively, to, shape, musical, structure, though, there, are, notable, examples, such, as, the, second, theme, from, the, first, movement, of, his, second, violin, concerto, of, which, he, commented, that, he, wanted, to, show, schoenberg, that, one, can, use, all, twelve, tones, and, still, remain, tonal, more, thoroughly, in, the, first, eight, measures, of, the, last, movement, of, his, second, quartet, all, notes, gradually, gather, with, the, twelfth, g, sounding, for, the, first, time, on, the, last, beat, of, measure, 8, marking, the, end, of, the, first, section, the, aggregate, is, partitioned, in, the, opening, of, the, third, string, quartet, with, c, d, d, e, in, the, accompaniment, strings, while, the, remaining, pitch, classes, are, used, in, the, melody, violin, 1, and, more, often, as, 7, 35, diatonic, or, white, key, collection, and, 5, 35, pentatonic, or, black, key, collection, such, as, in, no, 6, of, the, eight, improvisations, there, the, primary, theme, is, on, the, black, keys, in, the, left, hand, while, the, right, accompanies, with, triads, from, the, white, keys, in, measures, 50, 51, in, the, third, movement, of, the, fourth, quartet, the, first, violin, and, cello, play, black, key, chords, while, the, second, violin, and, viola, play, stepwise, diatonic, lines, on, the, other, hand, from, as, early, as, the, suite, for, piano, op, 14, 1914, he, occasionally, employed, a, form, of, serialism, based, on, compound, interval, cycles, some, of, which, are, maximally, distributed, multi, aggregate, cycles, ern, lendvai, analyses, bart, k, s, works, as, being, based, on, two, opposing, tonal, systems, that, of, the, acoustic, scale, and, the, axis, system, as, well, as, using, the, golden, section, as, a, structural, principle, milton, babbitt, in, his, 1949, review, of, bart, k, s, string, quartets, criticized, bart, k, for, using, tonality, and, non, tonal, methods, unique, to, each, piece, babbitt, noted, that, bart, k, s, solution, was, a, specific, one, it, cannot, be, duplicated, bart, k, s, use, of, two, organizational, principles, tonality, for, large, scale, relationships, and, the, piece, specific, method, for, moment, to, moment, thematic, elements, was, a, problem, for, babbitt, who, worried, that, the, highly, attenuated, tonality, requires, extreme, non, harmonic, methods, to, create, a, feeling, of, closure, the, cataloguing, of, bart, k, s, works, is, somewhat, complex, bart, k, assigned, opus, numbers, to, his, works, three, times, the, last, of, these, series, ending, with, the, sonata, for, violin, and, piano, no, 1, op, 21, in, 1921, he, ended, this, practice, because, of, the, difficulty, of, distinguishing, between, original, works, and, ethnographic, arrangements, and, between, major, and, minor, works, since, his, death, three, attempts, two, full, and, one, partial, have, been, made, at, cataloguing, the, first, and, still, most, widely, used, is, andr, s, sz, ll, sy, s, chronological, sz, numbers, from, 1, to, 121, denijs, dille, subsequently, reorganised, the, juvenilia, sz, 1, 25, thematically, as, dd, numbers, 1, to, 77, the, most, recent, catalogue, is, that, of, l, szl, somfai, this, is, a, chronological, index, with, works, identified, by, bb, numbers, 1, to, 129, incorporating, corrections, based, on, the, b, la, bart, k, thematic, catalogue, on, 1, january, 2016, bart, k, s, works, entered, the, public, domain, in, the, european, union, together, with, his, like, minded, contemporary, zolt, n, kod, ly, bart, k, embarked, on, an, extensive, programme, of, field, research, to, capture, the, folk, and, peasant, melodies, of, magyar, slovak, and, romanian, language, territories, at, first, they, would, transcribe, the, melodies, by, hand, but, later, they, began, to, use, a, wax, cylinder, recording, machine, invented, by, thomas, edison, compilations, of, bart, k, s, field, recordings, interviews, and, original, piano, playing, have, been, released, over, the, years, largely, by, the, hungarian, record, label, hungaroton, a, compilation, of, field, recordings, and, transcriptions, for, two, violas, was, also, recently, released, by, tantara, records, in, 2014, on, 18, march, 2016, decca, classics, released, b, la, bart, k, the, complete, works, the, first, ever, complete, compilation,
