born, on, 6, october, 1687, and, johanna, christiana, born, on, 10, january, 1690, early, in, his, life, handel, is, reported, to, have, attended, the, gymnasium, in, halle, where, the, headmaster, johann, praetorius, was, reputed, to, be, an, ardent, musician, whether, handel, remained, there, and, if, he, did, for, how, long, is, unknown, but, many, biographers, suggest, that, he, was, withdrawn, from, school, by, his, father, based, on, the, characterization, of, him, by, handel, s, first, biographer, john, mainwaring, mainwaring, is, the, source, for, almost, all, information, little, as, it, is, of, handel, s, childhood, and, much, of, that, information, came, from, j, c, smith, jr, handel, s, confidant, and, copyist, whether, it, came, from, smith, or, elsewhere, mainwaring, frequently, relates, misinformation, it, is, from, mainwaring, that, the, portrait, comes, of, handel, s, father, as, implacably, opposed, to, any, musical, education, mainwaring, writes, that, georg, h, ndel, was, alarmed, at, handel, s, very, early, propensity, for, music, took, every, measure, to, oppose, it, including, forbidding, any, musical, instrument, in, the, house, and, preventing, handel, from, going, to, any, house, where, they, might, be, found, this, did, nothing, to, dampen, young, handel, s, inclination, in, fact, it, did, the, reverse, mainwaring, tells, the, story, of, handel, s, secret, attic, spinet, handel, found, means, to, get, a, little, clavichord, privately, convey, d, to, a, room, at, the, top, of, the, house, to, this, room, he, constantly, stole, when, the, family, was, asleep, although, both, john, hawkins, and, charles, burney, credited, this, tale, schoelcher, found, it, nearly, incredible, and, a, feat, of, poetic, imagination, and, lang, considers, it, one, of, the, unproven, romantic, stories, that, surrounded, handel, s, childhood, but, handel, had, to, have, had, some, experience, with, the, keyboard, to, have, made, the, impression, in, weissenfels, that, resulted, in, his, receiving, formal, musical, training, sometime, between, the, ages, of, seven, and, nine, handel, accompanied, his, father, to, weissenfels, where, he, came, under, the, notice, of, one, whom, handel, thereafter, always, regarded, throughout, life, as, his, benefactor, duke, johann, adolf, i, somehow, handel, made, his, way, to, the, court, organ, in, the, palace, chapel, of, the, holy, trinity, where, he, surprised, everyone, with, his, playing, overhearing, this, performance, and, noting, the, youth, of, the, performer, caused, the, duke, whose, suggestions, were, not, to, be, disregarded, to, recommend, to, georg, h, ndel, that, handel, be, given, musical, instruction, handel, s, father, engaged, the, organist, at, the, halle, parish, church, the, young, friedrich, wilhelm, zachow, to, instruct, handel, zachow, would, be, the, only, teacher, that, handel, ever, had, because, of, his, church, employment, zachow, was, an, organist, of, the, old, school, revelling, in, fugues, canons, and, counterpoint, but, he, was, also, familiar, with, developments, in, music, across, europe, and, his, own, compositions, embraced, the, new, concerted, dramatic, style, when, zachow, discovered, the, talent, of, handel, he, introduced, him, to, a, vast, collection, of, german, and, italian, music, which, he, possessed, sacred, and, profane, vocal, and, instrumental, compositions, of, different, schools, different, styles, and, of, every, master, many, traits, considered, handelian, can, be, traced, back, to, zachow, s, music, at, the, same, time, handel, continued, practice, on, the, harpsichord, and, learned, violin, and, organ, but, according, to, burney, his, special, affection, was, for, the, hautbois, oboe, schoelcher, speculates, that, his, youthful, devotion, to, the, instrument, explains, the, large, number, of, pieces, he, composed, for, the, oboe, with, respect, to, instruction, in, composition, in, addition, to, having, handel, apply, himself, to, traditional, fugue, and, cantus, firmus, work, zachow, recognising, handel, s, precocious, talents, systematically, introduced, handel, to, the, variety, of, styles, and, masterworks, contained, in, his, extensive, library, he, did, this, by, requiring, handel, to, copy, selected, scores, i, used, to, write, like, the, devil, in, those, days, handel, recalled, much, later, much, of, this, copying, was, entered, into, a, notebook, that, handel, maintained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, although, it, has, since, disappeared, the, notebook, has, been, sufficiently, described, to, understand, what, pieces, zachow, wished, handel, to, study, among, the, chief, composers, represented, in, this, exercise, book, were, johann, krieger, an, old, master, in, the, fugue, and, prominent, organ, composer, johann, caspar, kerll, a, representative, of, the, southern, style, after, his, teacher, girolamo, frescobaldi, and, imitated, later, by, handel, johann, jakob, froberger, an, internationalist, also, closely, studied, by, buxtehude, and, bach, and, georg, muffat, whose, amalgam, of, french, and, italian, styles, and, his, synthesis, of, musical, forms, influenced, handel, mainwaring, writes, that, during, this, time, zachow, had, begun, to, have, handel, assume, some, of, his, church, duties, zachow, mainwaring, asserts, was, often, absent, from, his, love, of, company, and, a, cheerful, glass, and, handel, therefore, performed, on, organ, frequently, what, is, more, according, to, mainwaring, handel, began, composing, at, the, age, of, nine, church, services, for, voice, and, instruments, and, from, that, time, actually, did, compose, a, service, every, week, for, three, years, successively, mainwaring, ends, this, chapter, of, handel, s, life, by, concluding, that, three, or, four, years, had, been, enough, to, allow, handel, to, surpass, zachow, and, handel, had, become, impatient, for, another, situation, berlin, was, the, place, agreed, upon, carelessness, with, dates, or, sequences, and, possibly, imaginative, interpretation, by, mainwaring, makes, this, period, confused, handel, s, father, died, on, 11, february, 1697, it, was, german, custom, for, friends, and, family, to, compose, funeral, odes, for, a, substantial, burgher, like, georg, and, young, handel, discharged, his, duty, with, a, poem, dated, 18, february, and, signed, with, his, name, and, in, deference, to, his, father, s, wishes, dedicated, to, the, liberal, arts, at, the, time, handel, was, studying, either, at, halle, s, lutheran, gymnasium, or, the, latin, school, mainwaring, has, handel, travelling, to, berlin, the, next, year, 1698, the, problem, with, mainwaring, as, an, authority, for, this, date, however, is, that, he, tells, of, how, handel, s, father, communicated, with, the, king, during, handel, s, stay, declining, the, court, s, offer, to, send, handel, to, italy, on, a, stipend, and, that, his, father, died, after, his, return, from, berlin, but, since, georg, h, ndel, died, in, 1697, either, the, date, of, the, trip, or, mainwaring, s, statements, about, handel, s, father, must, be, in, error, early, biographers, solved, the, problem, by, making, the, year, of, the, trip, 1696, then, noting, that, at, the, age, of, 11, handel, would, need, a, guardian, so, they, have, handel, s, father, or, a, friend, of, the, family, accompany, him, all, the, while, puzzling, over, why, the, elder, handel, who, wanted, handel, to, become, a, lawyer, would, spend, the, sum, to, lead, his, son, further, into, the, temptation, of, music, as, a, career, schoelcher, for, example, has, handel, travelling, to, berlin, at, 11, meeting, both, bononcini, and, attilio, ariosti, in, berlin, and, then, returning, at, the, direction, of, his, father, but, ariosti, was, not, in, berlin, before, the, death, of, handel, s, father, and, handel, could, not, have, met, bononcini, in, berlin, before, 1702, modern, biographers, either, accept, the, year, as, 1698, since, most, reliable, older, authorities, agree, with, it, and, discount, what, mainwaring, says, about, what, took, place, during, the, trip, or, assume, that, mainwaring, conflated, two, or, more, visits, to, berlin, as, he, did, with, handel, s, later, trips, to, venice, perhaps, to, fulfil, a, promise, to, his, father, or, simply, because, he, saw, himself, as, dedicated, to, the, liberal, arts, on, 10, february, 1702, handel, matriculated, at, the, university, of, halle, that, university, had, only, recently, been, founded, in, 1694, the, elector, of, brandenburg, frederick, iii, later, prussian, king, frederick, i, created, the, school, largely, to, provide, a, lecture, forum, for, the, jurist, christian, thomasius, who, had, been, expelled, from, leipzig, for, his, liberal, views, handel, did, not, enrol, in, the, faculty, of, law, although, he, almost, certainly, attended, lectures, thomasius, was, an, intellectual, and, academic, crusader, who, was, the, first, german, academic, to, lecture, in, german, and, also, denounced, witch, trials, lang, believes, that, thomasius, instilled, in, handel, a, respect, for, the, dignity, and, freedom, of, man, s, mind, and, the, solemn, majesty, of, the, law, principles, that, would, have, drawn, him, to, and, kept, him, in, england, for, half, a, century, handel, also, there, encountered, theologian, and, professor, of, oriental, languages, august, hermann, francke, who, was, particularly, solicitous, of, children, especially, orphans, the, orphanage, he, founded, became, a, model, for, germany, and, undoubtedly, influenced, handel, s, own, charitable, impulse, when, he, assigned, the, rights, of, messiah, to, london, s, foundling, hospital, shortly, after, commencing, his, university, education, handel, though, lutheran, on, 13, march, 1702, accepted, the, position, of, organist, at, the, calvinist, cathedral, in, halle, the, domkirche, replacing, j, c, leporin, for, whom, he, had, acted, as, assistant, the, position, which, was, a, one, year, probationary, appointment, showed, the, foundation, he, had, received, from, zachow, for, a, church, organist, and, cantor, was, a, highly, prestigious, office, from, it, he, received, 5, thalers, a, year, and, lodgings, in, the, run, down, castle, of, moritzburg, around, this, same, time, handel, made, the, acquaintance, of, telemann, four, years, handel, s, senior, telemann, was, studying, law, at, leipzig, and, was, assisting, cantor, johann, kuhnau, bach, s, predecessor, at, the, thomaskirche, there, telemann, recalled, forty, years, later, in, an, autobiography, for, mattheson, s, grundlage, the, writing, of, the, excellent, johann, kuhnau, served, as, a, model, for, me, in, fugue, and, counterpoint, but, in, fashioning, melodic, movements, and, examining, them, handel, and, i, were, constantly, occupied, frequently, visiting, each, other, as, well, as, writing, letters, although, mainwaring, records, that, handel, wrote, weekly, when, assistant, to, zachow, and, as, probationary, organist, at, domkirche, part, of, his, duty, was, to, provide, suitable, music, no, sacred, compositions, from, his, halle, period, can, now, be, identified, mattheson, however, summarised, his, opinion, of, handel, s, church, cantatas, written, in, halle, handel, in, those, days, set, very, very, long, arias, and, sheerly, unending, cantatas, which, while, not, possessing, the, proper, knack, or, correct, taste, were, perfect, so, far, as, harmony, is, concerned, early, chamber, works, do, exist, but, it, is, difficult, to, date, any, of, them, to, handel, s, time, in, halle, many, historians, until, recently, followed, chrysander, and, designated, the, six, trio, sonatas, for, two, oboes, and, basso, continuo, as, his, first, known, composition, supposedly, written, in, 1696, when, handel, was, 11, lang, doubts, the, dating, based, on, a, handwritten, date, of, a, copy, 1700, and, stylistic, considerations, lang, writes, that, the, works, show, thorough, acquaintance, with, the, distilled, sonata, style, of, the, corelli, school, and, are, notable, for, the, formal, security, and, the, cleanness, of, the, texture, hogwood, considers, all, of, the, oboe, trio, sonatas, spurious, and, even, suggests, that, some, parts, cannot, be, performed, on, oboe, that, authentic, manuscript, sources, do, not, exist, and, that, handel, never, recycled, any, material, from, these, works, makes, their, authenticity, doubtful, other, early, chamber, works, were, printed, in, amsterdam, in, 1724, as, opus, 1, but, it, is, impossible, to, tell, which, are, early, works, in, their, original, form, rather, than, later, re, workings, by, handel, a, frequent, practice, of, his, handel, s, probationary, appointment, to, domkirche, expired, in, march, 1703, by, july, handel, was, in, hamburg, since, he, left, no, explanation, for, the, move, biographers, have, offered, their, own, speculation, donald, burrows, believes, that, the, answer, can, be, found, by, untangling, mainwaring, s, confused, chronology, of, the, trip, to, berlin, burrows, dates, this, trip, to, 1702, or, 1703, after, his, father, s, death, and, concludes, that, since, handel, through, a, friend, and, relation, at, the, berlin, court, turned, down, frederick, s, offer, to, subsidise, his, musical, education, in, italy, with, the, implicit, understanding, that, he, would, become, a, court, musician, on, his, return, handel, was, no, longer, able, to, expect, preferment, whether, as, a, musician, lawyer, or, otherwise, within, brandenburg, prussia, since, he, was, attracted, to, secular, dramatic, music, by, meeting, the, italians, bononcini, and, attilio, ariosti, and, through, the, influence, of, telemann, hamburg, a, free, city, with, an, established, opera, company, was, the, logical, choice, the, question, remains, however, why, handel, rejected, the, king, s, offer, given, that, italy, was, the, centre, of, opera, lang, suggests, that, influenced, by, the, teachings, of, thomasius, handel, s, character, was, such, that, he, was, unable, to, make, himself, subservient, to, anyone, even, a, king, lang, sees, handel, as, someone, who, could, not, accept, class, distinctions, that, required, him, to, regard, himself, as, a, social, inferior, what, handel, craved, was, personal, freedom, to, raise, himself, out, of, his, provincial, milieu, to, a, life, of, culture, burrows, notes, that, like, his, father, handel, was, able, to, accept, royal, and, aristocratic, favours, without, considering, himself, a, court, servant, and, so, given, the, embarrassed, financial, condition, of, his, mother, handel, set, off, for, hamburg, to, obtain, experience, while, supporting, himself, in, 1703, he, accepted, a, position, as, violinist, and, harpsichordist, in, the, orchestra, of, the, hamburg, oper, am, g, nsemarkt, there, he, met, the, composers, johann, mattheson, christoph, graupner, and, reinhard, keiser, handel, s, first, two, operas, almira, and, nero, were, produced, in, 1705, he, produced, two, other, operas, daphne, and, florindo, performed, in, 1708, according, to, mainwaring, in, 1706, handel, travelled, to, italy, at, the, invitation, of, ferdinando, de, medici, other, sources, say, handel, was, invited, by, gian, gastone, de, medici, whom, handel, had, met, in, 1703, 04, in, hamburg, ferdinando, who, had, a, keen, interest, in, opera, was, trying, to, make, florence, italy, s, musical, capital, by, attracting, the, leading, talents, of, his, day, in, italy, handel, met, librettist, antonio, salvi, with, whom, he, later, collaborated, handel, left, for, rome, and, since, opera, was, temporarily, banned, in, the, papal, states, composed, sacred, music, for, the, roman, clergy, his, famous, dixit, dominus, 1707, is, from, this, era, he, also, composed, cantatas, in, pastoral, style, for, musical, gatherings, in, the, palaces, of, duchess, aurora, sanseverino, whom, mainwaring, called, donna, laura, one, of, the, most, influential, patrons, from, the, kingdom, of, naples, and, cardinals, pietro, ottoboni, benedetto, pamphili, and, carlo, colonna, two, oratorios, la, resurrezione, and, il, trionfo, del, tempo, were, produced, in, a, private, setting, for, ruspoli, and,

thunderstruck, with, the, grandeur, and, sublimity, of, his, style, applauded, for, il, caro, sassone, the, dear, saxon, referring, to, handel, s, german, origins, in, june, 1710, handel, became, kapellmeister, to, german, prince, george, the, elector, of, hanover, but, left, at, the, end, of, the, year, it, is, likely, he, was, also, invited, by, charles, montagu, the, former, ambassador, in, venice, to, visit, england, he, visited, anna, maria, luisa, de, medici, and, her, husband, in, d, sseldorf, on, his, way, to, london, with, his, opera, rinaldo, based, on, la, gerusalemme, liberata, by, the, italian, poet, torquato, tasso, handel, enjoyed, great, success, although, it, was, composed, quickly, with, many, borrowings, from, his, older, italian, works, this, work, contains, one, of, handel, s, favourite, arias, cara, sposa, amante, cara, and, the, famous, lascia, ch, io, pianga, handel, went, back, to, halle, twice, to, attend, the, wedding, of, his, sister, and, the, baptism, of, her, daughter, but, decided, to, settle, permanently, in, england, in, 1712, in, the, summer, of, 1713, he, lived, at, mr, mathew, andrews, estate, in, barn, elms, surrey, he, received, a, yearly, income, of, 200, from, queen, anne, after, composing, for, her, the, utrecht, te, deum, and, jubilate, first, performed, in, 1713, one, of, his, most, important, patrons, was, the, 3rd, earl, of, burlington, and, 4th, earl, of, cork, a, young, and, extremely, wealthy, member, of, an, anglo, irish, aristocratic, family, while, living, in, the, mansion, of, lord, burlington, handel, wrote, amadigi, di, gaula, a, magic, opera, about, a, damsel, in, distress, based, on, the, tragedy, by, antoine, houdar, de, la, motte, the, conception, of, an, opera, as, a, coherent, structure, was, slow, to, capture, handel, s, imagination, and, he, composed, no, operas, for, five, years, in, july, 1717, handel, s, water, music, was, performed, more, than, three, times, on, the, river, thames, for,

wrote, that, these, anthems, or, psalms, stood, in, relation, to, handel, s, oratorios, much, the, same, way, that, the, italian, cantatas, stood, to, his, operas, splendid, sketches, of, the, more, monumental, works, another, work, which, he, wrote, for, the, 1st, duke, of, chandos, the, owner, of, cannons, was, acis, and, galatea, during, handel, s, lifetime, it, was, his, most, performed, work, winton, dean, wrote, that, the, music, catches, breath, and, disturbs, the, memory, in, 1719, the, duke, of, chandos, became, one, of, the, composer, s, important, patrons, and, a, primary, subscriber, to, his, new, opera, company, the, royal, academy, of, music, though, his, patronage, declined, after, chandos, lost, large, sums, of, money, in, the, south, sea, bubble, which, burst, in,

material, from, the, bible, the, circumstances, of, esther, and, its, first, performance, possibly, in, 1718, are, obscure, another, 12, years, had, passed, when, an, act, of, piracy, caused, him, to, take, up, esther, once, again, three, earlier, performances, aroused, such, interest, that, they, naturally, prompted, the, idea, of, introducing, it, to, a, larger, public, next, came, deborah, strongly, coloured, by, the, coronation, anthems, and, athaliah, his, third, english, oratorio, in, these, three, oratorios, handel, laid, the, foundation, for, the, traditional, use, of, the, chorus, which, marks, his, later, oratorios, handel, became, sure, of, himself, broader, in, his, presentation, and, more, diverse, in, his, composition, it, is, evident, how, much, he, learned, from, arcangelo, corelli, about, writing, for, instruments, and, from, alessandro, scarlatti, about, writing, for, the, solo, voice, but, there, is, no, single, composer, who, taught, him, how, to, write, for, chorus, handel, tended, more, and, more, to, replace, italian, soloists, with, english, ones, the, most, significant, reason, for, this, change, was, the, dwindling, financial, returns, from, his, operas, thus, a, tradition, was, created, for, oratorios, which, was, to, govern, their, future, performance, the, performances, were, given, without, costumes, and, action, the, singers, appeared, in, their, own, clothes, in, 1736, handel, produced, alexander, s, feast, john, beard, appeared, for, the, first, time, as, one, of, handel, s, principal, singers, and, became, handel, s, permanent, tenor, soloist, for, the, rest, of, handel, s, life, the, piece, was, a, great, success, and, it, encouraged, handel, to, make, the, transition, from, writing, italian, operas, to, english,

exception, and, not, the, rule, israel, in, egypt, consists, of, little, else, but, choruses, borrowing, from, the, funeral, anthem, for, queen, caroline, in, his, next, works, handel, changed, his, course, in, these, works, he, laid, greater, stress, on, the, effects, of, orchestra, and, soloists, the, chorus, retired, into, the, background, l, allegro, il, penseroso, ed, il, moderato, has, a, rather, diverting, character, the, work, is, light, and, fresh, during, the, summer, of, 1741, the, 3rd, duke, of, devonshire, invited, handel, to, dublin, capital, of, the, kingdom, of, ireland, to,

jephtha, was, first, performed, on, 26, february, 1752, even, though, it, was, his, last, oratorio, it, was, no, less, a, masterpiece, than, his, earlier, works, in, 1749, handel, composed, music, for, the, royal, fireworks, 12, 000, people, attended, the, first, performance, in, 1750, he, arranged, a, performance, of, messiah, to, benefit, the, foundling, hospital, a, children, s, home, in,

of, messiah, and, other, works, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, first, half, of, the, 20th, century, particularly, in, the, anglophone, countries, his, reputation, rested, primarily, on, his, english, oratorios, which, were, customarily, performed, by, choruses, of, amateur, singers, on, solemn, occasions, the, centenary, of, his, death, in, 1859, was, celebrated, by, a, performance, of,

of, queen, anne, 1713, are, noteworthy, for, his, secular, oratorios, handel, turned, to, classical, mythology, for, subjects, producing, such, works, as, acis, and, galatea, 1719, hercules, 1745, and, semele, 1744, these, works, have, a, close, kinship, with, the, sacred, oratorios, particularly, in, the, vocal, writing, for, the, english, language, texts, they, also, share, the, lyrical, and, dramatic, qualities, of, handel, s, italian, operas, as, such, they, are, sometimes, fully, staged, as, operas, with, the, rediscovery, of, his, theatrical, works, handel, in, addition, to, his, renown, as, instrumentalist, orchestral, writer, and, melodist, is, now, perceived, as, being, one, of, opera, s, great, musical, dramatists, handel, has, generally, been, accorded, high, esteem, by, fellow, composers, both, in, his, own, time, and, since, johann, sebastian, bach, attempted, unsuccessfully, to, meet, handel, while, he, was, visiting, halle, handel, was, born, in, the, same, year, as, bach, and, domenico, scarlatti, mozart, is, reputed, to, have, said, of, him, handel, understands, affect, better, than, any, of, us, when, he, chooses, he, strikes, like, a, thunder, bolt, to, beethoven, he, was, the, master, of, us, all, the, greatest, composer, that, ever, lived, i, would, uncover, my, head, and, kneel, before, his, tomb, beethoven, emphasised, above, all, the, simplicity, and, popular, appeal, of, handel, s, music, when, he, said, go, to, him, to, learn, how, to, achieve, great, effects, by, such, simple, means, since, 1831, when, william, crotch, raised, the, issue, in, his, substance, of, several, lectures, on, music, scholars, have, extensively, studied, handel, s, borrowing, of, music, from, other, composers, summarising, the, field, in, 2005, richard, taruskin, wrote, that, handel, seems, to, have, been, the, champion, of, all, parodists, adapting, both, his, own, works, and, those, of, other, composers, in, unparalleled, numbers, and, with, unparalleled, exactitude, among, the, composers, whose, music, handel, apparently, reused, are, alessandro, stradella, gottlieb, muffat, alessandro, scarlatti, domenico, scarlatti, giacomo,

henry, lawes, michael, wise, agostino, steffani, franz, johann, habermann, and, numerous, others, in, an, essay, published, in, 1985, john, h, roberts, demonstrated, that, handel, s, borrowings, were, unusually, frequent, even, for, his, own, era, enough, to, have, been, criticised, by, contemporaries, notably, johann, mattheson, roberts, suggested, several, reasons, for, handel, s, practice, including, handel, s, attempts, to, make, certain, works, sound, more, up, to, date, and, more, radically, his, basic, lack, of, facility, in, inventing, original, ideas, though, roberts, took, care, to, argue, that, this, does, not, diminish, handel, s, stature, which, should, be, judged, not, by, his, methods, still, less, by, his, motives, in, employing, them, but, solely, by, the, effects, he, achieves, after, handel, s, death, many, composers, wrote, works, based, on, or, inspired, by, his, music, the, first, movement, from, louis, spohr, s, symphony, no, 6, op, 116, the, age, of, bach,
