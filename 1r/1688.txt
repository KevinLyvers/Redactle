frederick, sanger, om, ch, cbe, frs, faa, s, r, 13, august, 1918, 19, november, 2013, was, a, british, biochemist, who, received, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, twice, he, won, the, 1958, chemistry, prize, for, determining, the, amino, acid, sequence, of, insulin, and, numerous, other, proteins, demonstrating, in, the, process, that, each, had, a, unique, definite, structure, this, was, a, foundational, discovery, for, the, central, dogma, of, molecular, biology, at, the, newly, constructed, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, in, cambridge, he, developed, and, subsequently, refined, the, first, ever, dna, sequencing, technique, which, vastly, expanded, the, number, of, feasible, experiments, in, molecular, biology, and, remains, in, widespread, use, today, the, breakthrough, earned, him, the, 1980, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, which, he, shared, with, walter, gilbert, and, paul, berg, he, is, one, of, only, three, people, to, have, won, multiple, nobel, prizes, in, the, same, category, the, others, being, john, bardeen, in, physics, and, karl, barry, sharpless, in, chemistry, and, one, of, five, persons, with, two, nobel, prizes, frederick, sanger, was, born, on, 13, august, 1918, in, rendcomb, a, small, village, in, gloucestershire, england, the, second, son, of, frederick, sanger, a, general, practitioner, and, his, wife, cicely, sanger, n, e, crewdson, he, was, one, of, three, children, his, brother, theodore, was, only, a, year, older, while, his, sister, may, mary, was, five, years, younger, his, father, had, worked, as, an, anglican, medical, missionary, in, china, but, returned, to, england, because, of, ill, health, he, was, 40, in, 1916, when, he, married, cicely, who, was, four, years, younger, sanger, s, father, converted, to, quakerism, soon, after, his, two, sons, were, born, and, brought, up, the, children, as, quakers, sanger, s, mother, was, the, daughter, of, an, affluent, cotton, manufacturer, and, had, a, quaker, background, but, was, not, a, quaker, when, sanger, was, around, five, years, old, the, family, moved, to, the, small, village, of, tanworth, in, arden, in, warwickshire, the, family, was, reasonably, wealthy, and, employed, a, governess, to, teach, the, children, in, 1927, at, the, age, of, nine, he, was, sent, to, the, downs, school, a, residential, preparatory, school, run, by, quakers, near, malvern, his, brother, theo, was, a, year, ahead, of, him, at, the, same, school, in, 1932, at, the, age, of, 14, he, was, sent, to, the, recently, established, bryanston, school, in, dorset, this, used, the, dalton, system, and, had, a, more, liberal, regime, which, sanger, much, preferred, at, the, school, he, liked, his, teachers, and, particularly, enjoyed, scientific, subjects, able, to, complete, his, school, certificate, a, year, early, for, which, he, was, awarded, seven, credits, sanger, was, able, to, spend, most, of, his, last, year, of, school, experimenting, in, the, laboratory, alongside, his, chemistry, master, geoffrey, ordish, who, had, originally, studied, at, cambridge, university, and, been, a, researcher, in, the, cavendish, laboratory, working, with, ordish, made, a, refreshing, change, from, sitting, and, studying, books, and, awakened, sanger, s, desire, to, pursue, a, scientific, career, in, 1935, prior, to, heading, off, to, college, sanger, was, sent, to, schule, schloss, salem, in, southern, germany, on, an, exchange, program, the, school, placed, a, heavy, emphasis, on, athletics, which, caused, sanger, to, be, much, further, ahead, in, the, course, material, compared, to, the, other, students, he, was, shocked, to, learn, that, each, day, was, started, with, readings, from, hitler, s, mein, kampf, followed, by, a, sieg, heil, salute, in, 1936, sanger, went, to, st, john, s, college, cambridge, to, study, natural, sciences, his, father, had, attended, the, same, college, for, part, i, of, his, tripos, he, took, courses, in, physics, chemistry, biochemistry, and, mathematics, but, struggled, with, physics, and, mathematics, many, of, the, other, students, had, studied, more, mathematics, at, school, in, his, second, year, he, replaced, physics, with, physiology, he, took, three, years, to, obtain, his, part, i, for, his, part, ii, he, studied, biochemistry, and, obtained, a, 1st, class, honours, biochemistry, was, a, relatively, new, department, founded, by, gowland, hopkins, with, enthusiastic, lecturers, who, included, malcolm, dixon, joseph, needham, and, ernest, baldwin, both, his, parents, died, from, cancer, during, his, first, two, years, at, cambridge, his, father, was, 60, and, his, mother, was, 58, as, an, undergraduate, sanger, s, beliefs, were, strongly, influenced, by, his, quaker, upbringing, he, was, a, pacifist, and, a, member, of, the, peace, pledge, union, it, was, through, his, involvement, with, the, cambridge, scientists, anti, war, group, that, he, met, his, future, wife, joan, howe, who, was, studying, economics, at, newnham, college, they, courted, while, he, was, studying, for, his, part, ii, exams, and, married, after, he, had, graduated, in, december, 1940, sanger, although, brought, up, and, influenced, by, his, religious, upbringing, later, began, to, lose, sight, of, his, quaker, related, ways, he, began, to, see, the, world, through, a, more, scientific, lens, and, with, the, growth, of, his, research, and, scientific, development, he, slowly, drifted, farther, from, the, faith, he, grew, up, with, he, has, nothing, but, respect, for, the, religious, and, states, he, took, two, things, from, it, truth, and, respect, for, all, life, under, the, military, training, act, 1939, he, was, provisionally, registered, as, a, conscientious, objector, and, again, under, the, national, service, armed, forces, act, 1939, before, being, granted, unconditional, exemption, from, military, service, by, a, tribunal, in, the, meantime, he, undertook, training, in, social, relief, work, at, the, quaker, centre, spicelands, devon, and, served, briefly, as, a, hospital, orderly, sanger, began, studying, for, a, phd, in, october, 1940, under, n, w, bill, pirie, his, project, was, to, investigate, whether, edible, protein, could, be, obtained, from, grass, after, little, more, than, a, month, pirie, left, the, department, and, albert, neuberger, became, his, adviser, sanger, changed, his, research, project, to, study, the, metabolism, of, lysine, and, a, more, practical, problem, concerning, the, nitrogen, of, potatoes, his, thesis, had, the, title, the, metabolism, of, the, amino, acid, lysine, in, the, animal, body, he, was, examined, by, charles, harington, and, albert, charles, chibnall, and, awarded, his, doctorate, in, 1943, neuberger, moved, to, the, national, institute, for, medical, research, in, london, but, sanger, stayed, in, cambridge, and, in, 1943, joined, the, group, of, charles, chibnall, a, protein, chemist, who, had, recently, taken, up, the, chair, in, the, department, of, biochemistry, chibnall, had, already, done, some, work, on, the, amino, acid, composition, of, bovine, insulin, and, suggested, that, sanger, look, at, the, amino, groups, in, the, protein, insulin, could, be, purchased, from, the, pharmacy, chain, boots, and, was, one, of, the, very, few, proteins, that, were, available, in, a, pure, form, up, to, this, time, sanger, had, been, funding, himself, in, chibnall, s, group, he, was, initially, supported, by, the, medical, research, council, and, then, from, 1944, until, 1951, by, a, beit, memorial, fellowship, for, medical, research, sanger, s, first, triumph, was, to, determine, the, complete, amino, acid, sequence, of, the, two, polypeptide, chains, of, bovine, insulin, a, and, b, in, 1952, and, 1951, respectively, prior, to, this, it, was, widely, assumed, that, proteins, were, somewhat, amorphous, in, determining, these, sequences, sanger, proved, that, proteins, have, a, defined, chemical, composition, to, get, to, this, point, sanger, refined, a, partition, chromatography, method, first, developed, by, richard, laurence, millington, synge, and, archer, john, porter, martin, to, determine, the, composition, of, amino, acids, in, wool, sanger, used, a, chemical, reagent, 1, fluoro, 2, 4, dinitrobenzene, now, also, known, as, sanger, s, reagent, fluorodinitrobenzene, fdnb, or, dnfb, sourced, from, poisonous, gas, research, by, bernard, charles, saunders, at, the, chemistry, department, at, cambridge, university, sanger, s, reagent, proved, effective, at, labelling, the, n, terminal, amino, group, at, one, end, of, the, polypeptide, chain, he, then, partially, hydrolysed, the, insulin, into, short, peptides, either, with, hydrochloric, acid, or, using, an, enzyme, such, as, trypsin, the, mixture, of, peptides, was, fractionated, in, two, dimensions, on, a, sheet, of, filter, paper, first, by, electrophoresis, in, one, dimension, and, then, perpendicular, to, that, by, chromatography, in, the, other, the, different, peptide, fragments, of, insulin, detected, with, ninhydrin, moved, to, different, positions, on, the, paper, creating, a, distinct, pattern, that, sanger, called, fingerprints, the, peptide, from, the, n, terminus, could, be, recognised, by, the, yellow, colour, imparted, by, the, fdnb, label, and, the, identity, of, the, labelled, amino, acid, at, the, end, of, the, peptide, determined, by, complete, acid, hydrolysis, and, discovering, which, dinitrophenyl, amino, acid, was, there, by, repeating, this, type, of, procedure, sanger, was, able, to, determine, the, sequences, of, the, many, peptides, generated, using, different, methods, for, the, initial, partial, hydrolysis, these, could, then, be, assembled, into, the, longer, sequences, to, deduce, the, complete, structure, of, insulin, finally, because, the, a, and, b, chains, are, physiologically, inactive, without, the, three, linking, disulfide, bonds, two, interchain, one, intrachain, on, a, sanger, and, coworkers, determined, their, assignments, in, 1955, sanger, s, principal, conclusion, was, that, the, two, polypeptide, chains, of, the, protein, insulin, had, precise, amino, acid, sequences, and, by, extension, that, every, protein, had, a, unique, sequence, it, was, this, achievement, that, earned, him, his, first, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1958, this, discovery, was, crucial, to, the, later, sequence, hypothesis, of, francis, crick, for, developing, ideas, of, how, dna, codes, for, proteins, from, 1951, sanger, was, a, member, of, the, external, staff, of, the, medical, research, council, and, when, they, opened, the, laboratory, of, molecular, biology, in, 1962, he, moved, from, his, laboratories, in, the, biochemistry, department, of, the, university, to, the, top, floor, of, the, new, building, he, became, head, of, the, protein, chemistry, division, prior, to, his, move, sanger, began, exploring, the, possibility, of, sequencing, rna, molecules, and, began, developing, methods, for, separating, ribonucleotide, fragments, generated, with, specific, nucleases, this, work, he, did, while, trying, to, refine, the, sequencing, techniques, he, had, developed, during, his, work, on, insulin, the, key, challenge, in, the, work, was, finding, a, pure, piece, of, rna, to, sequence, in, the, course, of, the, work, he, discovered, in, 1964, with, kjeld, marcker, the, formylmethionine, trna, which, initiates, protein, synthesis, in, bacteria, he, was, beaten, in, the, race, to, be, the, first, to, sequence, a, trna, molecule, by, a, group, led, by, robert, holley, from, cornell, university, who, published, the, sequence, of, the, 77, ribonucleotides, of, alanine, trna, from, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, in, 1965, by, 1967, sanger, s, group, had, determined, the, nucleotide, sequence, of, the, 5s, ribosomal, rna, from, escherichia, coli, a, small, rna, of, 120, nucleotides, sanger, then, turned, to, sequencing, dna, which, would, require, an, entirely, different, approach, he, looked, at, different, ways, of, using, dna, polymerase, i, from, e, coli, to, copy, single, stranded, dna, in, 1975, together, with, alan, coulson, he, published, a, sequencing, procedure, using, dna, polymerase, with, radiolabelled, nucleotides, that, he, called, the, plus, and, minus, technique, this, involved, two, closely, related, methods, that, generated, short, oligonucleotides, with, defined, 3, termini, these, could, be, fractionated, by, electrophoresis, on, a, polyacrylamide, gel, and, visualised, using, autoradiography, the, procedure, could, sequence, up, to, 80, nucleotides, in, one, go, and, was, a, big, improvement, on, what, had, gone, before, but, was, still, very, laborious, nevertheless, his, group, were, able, to, sequence, most, of, the, 5, 386, nucleotides, of, the, single, stranded, bacteriophage, x174, this, was, the, first, fully, sequenced, dna, based, genome, to, their, surprise, they, discovered, that, the, coding, regions, of, some, of, the, genes, overlapped, with, one, another, in, 1977, sanger, and, colleagues, introduced, the, dideoxy, chain, termination, method, for, sequencing, dna, molecules, also, known, as, the, sanger, method, this, was, a, major, breakthrough, and, allowed, long, stretches, of, dna, to, be, rapidly, and, accurately, sequenced, it, earned, him, his, second, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1980, which, he, shared, with, walter, gilbert, and, paul, berg, the, new, method, was, used, by, sanger, and, colleagues, to, sequence, human, mitochondrial, dna, 16, 569, base, pairs, and, bacteriophage, 48, 502, base, pairs, the, dideoxy, method, was, eventually, used, to, sequence, the, entire, human, genome, during, the, course, of, his, career, sanger, supervised, more, than, ten, phd, students, two, of, whom, went, on, to, also, win, nobel, prizes, his, first, graduate, student, was, rodney, porter, who, joined, the, research, group, in, 1947, porter, later, shared, the, 1972, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, with, gerald, edelman, for, his, work, on, the, chemical, structure, of, antibodies, elizabeth, blackburn, studied, for, a, phd, in, sanger, s, laboratory, between, 1971, and, 1974, she, shared, the, 2009, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, with, carol, w, greider, and, jack, w, szostak, for, her, work, on, telomeres, and, the, action, of, telomerase, anytime, you, get, technical, development, that, s, two, to, threefold, or, more, efficient, accurate, cheaper, a, whole, range, of, experiments, opens, up, this, rule, should, not, be, confused, with, terence, sanger, s, rule, which, is, related, to, oja, s, rule, as, of, 2015, sanger, is, one, of, the, only, two, people, to, have, been, awarded, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, twice, the, other, being, karl, barry, sharpless, in, 2001, and, 2022, and, one, of, only, five, two, time, nobel, laureates, the, other, four, were, marie, curie, physics, 1903, and, chemistry, 1911, linus, pauling, chemistry, 1954, and, peace, 1962, john, bardeen, twice, physics, 1956, and, 1972, and, karl, barry, sharpless, twice, chemistry, 2001, and, 2022, the, wellcome, trust, sanger, institute, formerly, the, sanger, centre, is, named, in, his, honour, sanger, married, margaret, joan, howe, not, to, be, confused, with, margaret, sanger, the, american, pioneer, of, birth, control, in, 1940, she, died, in, 2012, they, had, three, children, robin, born, in, 1943, peter, born, in, 1946, and, sally, joan, born, in, 1960, he, said, that, his, wife, had, contributed, more, to, his, work, than, anyone, else, by, providing, a, peaceful, and, happy, home, sanger, retired, in, 1983, aged, 65, to, his, home, far, leys, in, swaffham, bulbeck, outside, cambridge, in, 1992, the, wellcome, trust, and, the, medical, research, council, founded, the, sanger, centre, now, the, sanger, institute, named, after, him, the, institute, is, on, the, wellcome, trust, genome, campus, near, hinxton, only, a, few, miles, from, sanger, s, home, he, agreed, to, having, the, centre, named, after, him, when, asked, by, john, sulston, the, founding, director, but, warned, it, had, better, be, good, it, was, opened, by, sanger, in, person, on, 4, october, 1993, with, a, staff, of, fewer, than, 50, people, and, went, on, to, take, a, leading, role, in, the, sequencing, of, the, human, genome, the, institute, had, about, 900, people, in, 2020, and, is, one, of, the, world, s, largest, genomic, research, centres, sanger, said, he, found, no, evidence, for, a, god, so, he, became, an, agnostic, in, an, interview, published, in, the, times, newspaper, in, 2000, sanger, is, quoted, as, saying, my, father, was, a, committed, quaker, and, i, was, brought, up, as, a, quaker, and, for, them, truth, is, very, important, i, drifted, away, from, those, beliefs, one, is, obviously, looking, for, truth, but, one, needs, some, evidence, for, it, even, if, i, wanted, to, believe, in, god, i, would, find, it, very, difficult, i, would, need, to, see, proof, he, declined, the, offer, of, a, knighthood, as, he, did, not, wish, to, be, addressed, as, sir, he, is, quoted, as, saying, a, knighthood, makes, you, different, doesn, t, it, and, i, don, t, want, to, be, different, in, 1986, he, accepted, admission, to, the, order, of, merit, which, can, have, only, 24, living, members, in, 2007, the, british, biochemical, society, was, given, a, grant, by, the, wellcome, trust, to, catalogue, and, preserve, the, 35, laboratory, notebooks, in, which, sanger, recorded, his, research, from, 1944, to, 1983, in, reporting, this, matter, science, noted, that, sanger, the, most, self, effacing, person, you, could, hope, to, meet, was, spending, his, time, gardening, at, his, cambridgeshire, home, sanger, died, in, his, sleep, at, addenbrooke, s, hospital, in, cambridge, on, 19, november, 2013, as, noted, in, his, obituary, he, had, described, himself, as, just, a, chap, who, messed, about, in, a, lab, and, academically, not, brilliant, he, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, agreement, to, convene, a, convention, for, drafting, a, world, constitution, as, a, result, for, the, first, time, in, human, history, a, world, constituent, assembly, convened, to, draft, and, adopt, a, constitution, for, the, federation, of, earth
