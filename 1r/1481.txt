at, the, local, anglican, school, llanystumdwy, national, school, and, later, under, tutors, he, was, brought, up, with, welsh, as, his, first, language, roy, jenkins, another, welsh, politician, notes, that, lloyd, george, was, welsh, that, his, whole, culture, his, whole, outlook, his, language, was, welsh, though, brought, up, a, devout, evangelical, lloyd, george, privately, lost, his, religious, faith, as, a, young, man, biographer, don, cregier, says, he, became, a, deist, and, perhaps, an, agnostic, though, he, remained, a, chapel, goer, and, connoisseur, of, good, preaching, all, his, life, he, was, nevertheless, according, to, frank, owen, one, of, the, foremost, fighting, leaders, of, a, fanatical, welsh, nonconformity, for, a, quarter, of, a, century, 6, lloyd, george, qualified, as, a, solicitor, in, 1884, after, being, articled, to, a, firm, in, porthmadog, and, taking, honours, in, his, final, law, examination, he, set, up, his, own, practice, in, the, back, parlour, of, his, uncle, s, house, in, 1885, although, many, prime, ministers, have, been, barristers, lloyd, george, is, as, of, 2024, the, only, solicitor, to, have, held, that, office, as, a, solicitor, lloyd, george, was, politically, active, from, the, start, campaigning, for, his, uncle, s, liberal, party, in, the, 1885, election, he, was, attracted, by, joseph, chamberlain, s, unauthorised, programme, of, radical, reform, 43, after, the, election, chamberlain, split, with, gladstone, in, opposition, to, irish, home, rule, and, lloyd, george, moved, to, join, the, liberal, unionists, uncertain, of, which, wing, to, follow, he, moved, a, resolution, in, support, of, chamberlain, at, a, local, liberal, club, and, travelled, to, birmingham, to, attend, the, first, meeting, of, chamberlain, s, new, national, radical, union, but, arrived, a, week, too, early, 53, in, 1907, lloyd, george, would, tell, herbert, lewis, that, he, had, thought, chamberlain, s, plan, for, a, federal, solution, to, the, home, rule, question, correct, in, 1886, and, still, thought, so, and, that, if, henry, richmond, osborne, morgan, and, the, welsh, members, had, stood, by, chamberlain, on, an, agreement, as, regards, the, disestablishment, they, would, have, carried, wales, with, them, 53, his, legal, practice, quickly, flourished, he, established, branch, offices, in, surrounding, towns, and, took, his, brother, william, into, partnership, in, 1887, lloyd, george, s, legal, and, political, triumph, came, in, the, llanfrothen, burial, case, which, established, the, right, of, nonconformists, to, be, buried, according, to, denominational, rites, in, parish, burial, grounds, as, given, by, the, burial, laws, amendment, act, 1880, but, theretofore, ignored, by, the, anglican, clergy, on, lloyd, george, s, advice, a, baptist, burial, party, broke, open, a, gate, to, a, cemetery, that, had, been, locked, against, them, by, the, vicar, the, vicar, sued, them, for, trespass, and, although, the, jury, returned, a, verdict, for, the, party, the, local, judge, misrecorded, the, jury, s, verdict, and, found, in, the, vicar, s, favour, suspecting, bias, lloyd, george, s, clients, won, on, appeal, to, the, divisional, court, of, queen, s, bench, in, london, where, lord, chief, justice, coleridge, found, in, their, favour, 14, 15, the, case, was, hailed, as, a, great, victory, throughout, wales, and, led, to, lloyd, george, s, adoption, as, the, liberal, candidate, for, carnarvon, boroughs, on, 27, december, 1888, 46, the, same, year, he, and, other, young, welsh, liberals, founded, a, monthly, paper, udgorn, rhyddid, bugle, of, freedom, 14, 15, in, 1889, lloyd, george, became, an, alderman, on, carnarvonshire, county, council, a, new, body, which, had, been, created, by, the, local, government, act, 1888, and, would, remain, so, for, the, rest, of, his, life, 15, 65, 66, lloyd, george, would, also, serve, the, county, as, a, justice, of, the, peace, 1910, chairman, of, quarter, sessions, 1929, 38, and, deputy, lieutenant, in, 1921, lloyd, george, married, margaret, owen, the, daughter, of, a, well, to, do, local, farming, family, on, 24, january, 1888, 15, 16, lloyd, george, s, career, as, a, member, of, parliament, began, when, he, was, returned, as, a, liberal, mp, for, caernarfon, boroughs, now, caernarfon, narrowly, winning, the, by, election, on, 10, april, 1890, following, the, death, of, the, conservative, member, edmund, swetenham, he, would, remain, an, mp, for, the, same, constituency, until, 1945, 55, years, later, lloyd, george, s, early, beginnings, in, westminster, may, have, proven, difficult, for, him, as, a, radical, liberal, and, a, great, outsider, backbench, members, of, the, house, of, commons, were, not, paid, at, that, time, so, lloyd, george, supported, himself, and, his, growing, family, by, continuing, to, practise, as, a, solicitor, he, opened, an, office, in, london, under, the, name, of, lloyd, george, and, co, and, continued, in, partnership, with, william, george, in, criccieth, in, 1897, he, merged, his, growing, london, practice, with, that, of, arthur, rhys, roberts, who, was, to, become, official, solicitor, under, the, name, of, lloyd, george, roberts, and, co, kenneth, o, morgan, describes, lloyd, george, as, a, lifelong, welsh, nationalist, and, suggests, that, between, 1880, and, 1914, he, was, the, symbol, and, tribune, of, the, national, reawakening, of, wales, although, he, is, also, clear, that, from, the, early, 1900s, his, main, focus, gradually, shifted, to, uk, wide, issues, he, also, became, an, associate, of, tom, ellis, mp, for, meirionydd, having, previously, told, a, caernarfon, friend, in, 1888, that, he, was, a, welsh, nationalist, of, the, ellis, type, one, of, lloyd, george, s, first, acts, as, an, mp, was, to, organise, an, informal, grouping, of, welsh, liberal, members, with, a, programme, that, included, disestablishing, and, disendowing, the, church, of, england, in, wales, temperance, reform, and, establishing, welsh, home, rule, 50, he, was, keen, on, decentralisation, and, thus, welsh, devolution, starting, with, the, devolution, of, the, church, in, wales, saying, in, 1890, i, am, deeply, impressed, with, the, fact, that, wales, has, wants, and, inspirations, of, her, own, which, have, too, long, been, ignored, but, which, must, no, longer, be, neglected, first, and, foremost, amongst, these, stands, the, cause, of, religious, liberty, and, equality, in, wales, if, returned, to, parliament, by, you, it, shall, be, my, earnest, endeavour, to, labour, for, the, triumph, of, this, great, cause, i, believe, in, a, liberal, extension, of, the, principle, of, decentralization, during, the, next, decade, lloyd, george, campaigned, in, parliament, largely, on, welsh, issues, in, particular, for, disestablishment, and, disendowment, of, the, church, of, england, when, gladstone, retired, in, 1894, after, the, defeat, of, the, second, home, rule, bill, the, welsh, liberal, members, chose, him, to, serve, on, a, deputation, to, william, harcourt, to, press, for, specific, assurances, on, welsh, issues, when, those, assurances, were, not, provided, they, resolved, to, take, independent, action, if, the, government, did, not, bring, a, bill, for, disestablishment, when, a, bill, was, not, forthcoming, he, and, three, other, welsh, liberals, d, a, thomas, herbert, lewis, and, frank, edwards, refused, the, whip, on, 14, april, 1894, but, accepted, lord, rosebery, s, assurance, and, rejoined, the, official, liberals, on, 29, may, historian, emyr, price, referred, to, lloyd, george, as, the, first, architect, of, welsh, devolution, and, its, most, famous, advocate, as, well, as, the, pioneering, advocate, of, a, powerful, parliament, for, the, welsh, people, lloyd, george, himself, stated, in, 1880, is, it, not, high, time, that, wales, should, the, powers, to, manage, its, own, affairs, and, in, 1890, parliament, is, so, overweighted, that, it, cannot, possibly, devote, the, time, and, trouble, necessary, to, legislate, for, the, peculiar, and, domestic, retirement, of, each, and, every, separate, province, of, britain, these, statements, would, later, be, used, to, advocate, for, a, welsh, assembly, in, the, 1979, welsh, devolution, referendum, lloyd, george, felt, that, disestablishment, land, reform, and, other, forms, of, welsh, devolution, could, only, be, achieved, if, wales, formed, its, own, government, within, a, federal, imperial, system, in, 1895, in, a, failed, church, in, wales, bill, lloyd, george, added, an, amendment, in, a, discreet, attempt, at, forming, a, sort, of, welsh, home, rule, a, national, council, for, appointment, of, the, welsh, church, commissioners, although, not, condemned, by, tom, ellis, mp, this, was, to, the, annoyance, of, j, bryn, roberts, mp, and, the, home, secretary, h, h, asquith, mp, he, was, also, a, co, leader, of, cymru, fydd, a, national, welsh, party, with, liberal, values, with, the, goals, of, promoting, a, stronger, welsh, identity, and, establishing, a, welsh, government, he, hoped, that, cymru, fydd, would, become, a, force, like, the, irish, national, party, he, abandoned, this, idea, after, being, criticised, in, welsh, newspapers, for, bringing, about, the, defeat, of, the, liberal, party, in, the, 1895, election, in, an, agm, meeting, in, newport, on, 16, january, 1896, of, the, south, wales, liberal, federation, led, by, d, a, thomas, a, proposal, was, made, to, unite, the, north, and, south, liberal, federations, with, cymru, fydd, to, form, the, welsh, national, federation, this, was, a, proposal, which, the, north, wales, liberal, federation, had, already, agreed, to, however, the, south, wales, liberal, federation, rejected, this, according, to, lloyd, george, he, was, shouted, down, by, newport, englishmen, in, the, meeting, although, the, south, wales, argus, suggested, the, poor, crowd, behaviour, came, from, lloyd, george, s, supporters, following, difficulty, in, uniting, the, liberal, federations, along, with, cymru, fydd, in, the, south, east, and, thus, difficulty, in, gaining, support, for, home, rule, for, wales, lloyd, george, shifted, his, focus, to, improving, the, socio, economic, environment, of, wales, as, part, of, the, united, kingdom, and, the, british, empire, although, lloyd, george, considered, himself, a, welshman, first, he, saw, the, opportunities, for, wales, within, the, uk, in, 1898, lloyd, george, created, the, welsh, national, liberal, council, a, loose, umbrella, organisation, covering, the, two, federations, but, with, very, little, power, in, time, it, became, known, as, the, liberal, party, of, wales, lloyd, george, had, a, connection, to, or, promoted, the, establishment, of, the, national, library, of, wales, the, national, museum, of, wales, and, the, welsh, department, of, the, board, of, education, he, also, showed, considerable, support, for, the, university, of, wales, that, its, establishment, raised, the, status, of, welsh, people, and, that, the, university, deserved, greater, funding, by, the, uk, government, lloyd, george, had, been, impressed, by, his, journey, to, canada, in, 1899, although, sometimes, wrongly, supposed, both, at, the, time, and, subsequently, to, be, a, little, englander, he, was, not, an, opponent, of, the, british, empire, per, se, but, in, a, speech, at, birkenhead, 21, november, 1901, he, stressed, that, it, needed, to, be, based, on, freedom, including, for, india, not, racial, arrogance, 61, consequently, he, gained, national, fame, by, displaying, vehement, opposition, to, the, second, boer, war, following, rosebery, s, lead, he, based, his, attack, firstly, on, what, were, supposed, to, be, britain, s, war, aims, remedying, the, grievances, of, the, italicno, and, in, particular, the, claim, that, they, were, wrongly, denied, the, right, to, vote, saying, i, do, not, believe, the, war, has, any, connection, with, the, franchise, it, is, a, question, of, 45, dividends, and, that, england, which, did, not, then, have, universal, male, suffrage, was, more, in, need, of, franchise, reform, than, the, boer, republics, a, second, attack, came, on, the, cost, of, the, war, which, he, argued, prevented, overdue, social, reform, in, england, such, as, old, age, pensions, and, workmen, s, cottages, as, the, fighting, continued, his, attacks, moved, to, its, conduct, by, the, generals, who, he, said, basing, his, words, on, reports, by, william, burdett, coutts, in, the, times, were, not, providing, for, the, sick, or, wounded, soldiers, and, were, starving, boer, women, and, children, in, concentration, camps, but, his, major, thrusts, were, reserved, for, the, chamberlains, accusing, them, of, war, profiteering, through, the, family, company, kynoch, ltd, of, which, chamberlain, s, brother, was, chairman, the, firm, had, won, tenders, to, the, war, office, though, its, prices, were, higher, than, some, of, its, competitors, after, speaking, at, a, meeting, in, birmingham, lloyd, george, had, to, be, smuggled, out, disguised, as, a, policeman, as, his, life, was, in, danger, from, the, mob, at, this, time, the, liberal, party, was, badly, split, as, h, h, asquith, r, b, haldane, and, others, were, supporters, of, the, war, and, formed, the, liberal, imperial, league, on, 24, march, arthur, balfour, just, about, to, take, office, as, prime, minister, introduced, a, bill, which, was, to, become, the, education, act, 1902, lloyd, george, supported, the, bill, s, proposals, to, bring, voluntary, schools, i, e, religious, schools, mainly, church, of, england, and, some, roman, catholic, schools, in, certain, inner, city, areas, in, england, and, wales, under, the, control, of, local, school, boards, who, would, conduct, inspections, and, appoint, two, out, of, each, school, s, six, managers, however, other, measures, were, more, contentious, the, majority, religious, school, managers, would, retain, the, power, to, employ, or, sack, teachers, on, religious, grounds, and, would, receive, money, from, the, rates, local, property, taxes, this, offended, nonconformist, opinion, then, in, a, period, of, revival, as, it, seemed, like, a, return, to, the, hated, church, rates, which, had, been, compulsory, until, 1868, and, inspired, a, large, grassroots, campaign, against, the, bill, 52, 7, within, days, of, the, bill, s, unveiling, 27, march, lloyd, george, denounced, priestcraft, in, a, speech, to, his, constituents, and, he, began, an, active, campaign, of, speaking, against, the, bill, both, in, public, in, wales, with, a, few, speeches, in, england, and, in, the, house, of, commons, on, 12, november, balfour, accepted, an, amendment, willingly, but, a, rare, case, of, him, doing, so, ostensibly, from, alfred, thomas, chairman, of, the, welsh, parliamentary, liberal, party, but, in, reality, instigated, by, lloyd, george, transferring, control, of, welsh, schools, from, appointed, boards, to, the, elected, county, councils, the, education, act, became, law, on, 20, december, 1902, 52, 7, lloyd, george, now, announced, the, real, purpose, of, the, amendment, described, as, a, booby, trap, by, his, biographer, john, grigg, the, welsh, national, liberal, council, soon, adopted, his, proposal, that, county, councils, should, refuse, funding, unless, repairs, were, carried, out, to, schools, many, were, in, a, poor, state, and, should, also, demand, control, of, school, governing, bodies, and, a, ban, on, religious, tests, for, teachers, no, control, no, cash, was, lloyd, george, s, slogan, lloyd, george, negotiated, with, a, g, edwards, anglican, bishop, of, st, asaph, and, was, prepared, to, settle, on, an, agreed, religious, syllabus, or, even, to, allow, anglican, teaching, in, schools, provided, the, county, councils, retained, control, of, teacher, appointments, but, this, compromise, failed, after, opposition, from, other, anglican, welsh, bishops, a, well, attended, meeting, at, park, hall, cardiff, 3, june, 1903, passed, a, number, of, resolutions, by, acclamation, county, council, control, of, schools, withholding, money, from, schools, or, even, withholding, rates, from, unsupportive, county, councils, the, liberals, soon, gained, control, of, all, thirteen, welsh, county, councils, lloyd, george, continued, to, speak, in, england, against, the, bill, but, the, campaign, there, was, less, aggressively, led, taking, the, form, of, passive, resistance, to, rate, paying, 52, 57, in, august, 1904, the, government, brought, in, the, education, local, authority, default, act, giving, the, board, of, education, power, to, take, charge, of, schools, which, lloyd, george, immediately, nicknamed, the, coercion, of, wales, act, he, addressed, another, convention, in, cardiff, on, 6, october, 1904, during, which, he, proclaimed, that, the, welsh, flag, was, a, dragon, rampant, not, a, sheep, recumbent, under, his, leadership, the, convention, pledged, not, to, maintain, elementary, schools, or, to, withdraw, children, from, elementary, schools, altogether, so, that, they, could, be, taught, privately, by, the, nonconformist, churches, in, travis, crosbie, s, words, public, resistance, to, the, education, act, had, caused, a, perfect, impasse, 52, 57, there, was, no, progress, between, welsh, counties, and, westminster, until, 1905, having, already, gained, national, recognition, for, his, anti, boer, war, campaigns, lloyd, george, s, leadership, of, the, attacks, on, the, education, act, gave, him, a, strong, parliamentary, reputation, and, marked, him, as, a, likely, future, cabinet, member, the, act, served, to, reunify, the, liberals, after, their, divisions, over, the, boer, war, and, to, increase, nonconformist, influence, in, the, party, which, then, included, educational, reform, as, policy, in, the, 1906, election, which, resulted, in, a, liberal, landslide, all, 34, welsh, seats, returned, a, liberal, except, for, one, labour, seat, in, merthyr, tydfil, lloyd, george, also, supported, the, romantic, nationalist, idea, of, pan, celtic, unity, and, gave, a, speech, at, the, 1904, pan, celtic, congress, in, caernarfon, during, his, second, ever, speech, in, the, house, of, commons, lloyd, george, criticised, the, grandeur, of, the, monarchy, lloyd, george, wrote, extensively, for, liberal, supporting, papers, such, as, the, manchester, guardian, and, spoke, on, liberal, issues, particularly, temperance, the, local, option, and, national, as, opposed, to, denominational, education, throughout, england, and, wales, he, served, as, the, legal, adviser, of, theodor, herzl, in, his, negotiations, with, the, british, government, regarding, the, uganda, scheme, proposed, as, an, alternative, homeland, for, the, jews, due, to, turkish, refusal, to, grant, a, charter, for, jewish, settlement, in, palestine, in, 1905, lloyd, george, entered, the, new, liberal, cabinet, of, sir, henry, campbell, bannerman, as, president, of, the, board, of, trade, 63, the, first, priority, on, taking, office, was, the, repeal, of, the, 1902, education, act, lloyd, george, took, the, lead, along, with, augustine, birrell, president, of, the, board, of, education, lloyd, george, appears, to, have, been, the, dominant, figure, on, the, committee, drawing, up, the, bill, in, its, later, stages, and, insisted, that, the, bill, create, a, separate, education, committee, for, wales, birrell, complained, privately, that, the, bill, introduced, in, the, commons, on, 9, april, 1906, owed, more, to, lloyd, george, and, that, he, himself, had, had, little, say, in, its, contents, 74, 77, the, bill, passed, the, house, of, commons, greatly, amended, but, was, completely, mangled, by, the, house, of, lords, for, the, rest, of, the, year, lloyd, george, made, numerous, public, speeches, attacking, the, house, of, lords, for, mutilating, the, bill, with, wrecking, amendments, in, defiance, of, the, liberals, electoral, mandate, to, reform, the, 1902, act, lloyd, george, was, rebuked, by, king, edward, vii, for, these, speeches, the, prime, minister, defended, him, to, the, king, s, secretary, francis, knollys, stating, that, his, behaviour, in, parliament, was, more, constructive, but, that, in, speeches, to, the, public, the, combative, spirit, seems, to, get, the, better, of, him, 74, 77, no, compromise, was, possible, and, the, bill, was, abandoned, allowing, the, 1902, act, to, continue, in, effect, as, a, result, of, lloyd, george, s, lobbying, a, separate, department, for, wales, was, created, within, the, board, of, education, 74, 77, nonconformists, were, bitterly, upset, by, the, failure, of, the, liberal, party, to, reform, the, 1902, education, act, its, most, important, promise, to, them, and, over, time, their, support, for, the, liberal, party, slowly, fell, away, at, the, board, of, trade, lloyd, george, introduced, legislation, on, many, topics, from, merchant, shipping, and, the, port, of, london, to, companies, and, railway, regulation, his, main, achievement, was, in, stopping, a, proposed, national, strike, of, the, railway, unions, by, brokering, an, agreement, between, the, unions, and, the, railway, companies, while, almost, all, the, companies, refused, to, recognise, the, unions, lloyd, george, persuaded, the, companies, to, recognise, elected, representatives, of, the, workers, who, sat, with, the, company, representatives, on, conciliation, boards, one, for, each, company, if, those, boards, failed, to, agree, then, an, arbitrator, would, be, called, upon, 69, 73, on, campbell, bannerman, s, death, he, succeeded, asquith, who, had, become, prime, minister, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, from, 1908, to, 1915, 81, 189, 190, while, he, continued, some, work, from, the, board, of, trade, for, example, legislation, to, establish, the, port, of, london, authority, and, to, pursue, traditional, liberal, programmes, such, as, licensing, law, reforms, his, first, major, trial, in, this, role, was, over, the, 1909, 1910, naval, estimates, the, liberal, manifesto, at, the, 1906, general, election, included, a, commitment, to, reduce, military, expenditure, lloyd, george, strongly, supported, this, writing, to, reginald, mckenna, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, of, the, emphatic, pledges, given, by, all, of, us, at, the, last, general, election, to, reduce, the, gigantic, expenditure, on, armaments, built, up, by, the, recklessness, of, our, predecessors, he, then, proposed, the, programme, be, reduced, from, six, to, four, dreadnoughts, this, was, adopted, by, the, government, but, there, was, a, public, storm, when, the, conservatives, with, covert, support, from, the, first, sea, lord, admiral, jackie, fisher, campaigned, for, more, with, the, slogan, we, want, eight, and, we, won, t, wait, this, resulted, in, lloyd, george, s, defeat, in, cabinet, and, the, adoption, of, estimates, including, provision, for, eight, dreadnoughts, during, this, period, he, was, also, a, target, of, protest, by, the, women, s, suffrage, movement, for, he, professed, personal, support, for, extension, of, the, suffrage, but, did, not, move, for, changes, within, the, parliament, process, in, 1909, lloyd, george, introduced, his, people, s, budget, imposing, a, 20, tax, on, the, unearned, increase, in, the, value, of, land, payable, at, the, death, of, the, owner, or, sale, of, the, land, and, 1, 2, d, on, undeveloped, land, and, minerals, increased, death, duties, a, rise, in, income, tax, and, the, introduction, of, supertax, on, income, over, 3, 000, there, were, taxes, also, on, luxuries, alcohol, and, tobacco, so, that, money, could, be, made, available, for, the, new, welfare, programmes, as, well, as, new, battleships, the, nation, s, landowners, well, represented, in, the, house, of, lords, were, intensely, angry, at, the, new, taxes, mostly, at, the, proposed, very, high, tax, on, land, values, but, also, because, the, instrumental, redistribution, of, wealth, could, be, used, to, detract, from, an, argument, for, protective, tariffs, the, immediate, consequences, included, the, end, of, the, liberal, league, and, rosebery, breaking, friendship, with, the, liberal, party, which, in, itself, was, for, lloyd, george, a, triumph, he, had, won, the, case, of, social, reform, without, losing, the, debate, on, free, trade, 166, arthur, balfour, denounced, the, budget, as, vindictive, inequitable, based, on, no, principles, and, injurious, to, the, productive, capacity, of, the, country, 167, roy, jenkins, described, it, as, the, most, reverberating, since, gladstone, s, in, 1860, 172, in, the, house, of, commons, lloyd, george, gave, a, brilliant, account, of, the, budget, which, was, attacked, by, the, conservatives, on, the, stump, notably, at, his, limehouse, speech, in, 1909, he, denounced, the, conservatives, and, the, wealthy, classes, with, all, his, very, considerable, oratorical, power, excoriating, the, house, of, lords, in, another, speech, lloyd, george, said, should, 500, men, ordinary, men, chosen, accidentally, from, among, the, unemployed, override, the, judgement, the, deliberate, judgement, of, millions, of, people, who, are, engaged, in, the, industry, which, makes, the, wealth, of, the, country, in, a, break, with, convention, the, budget, was, defeated, by, the, conservative, majority, in, the, house, of, lords, the, elections, of, 1910, narrowly, upheld, the, liberal, government, the, 1909, budget, was, passed, on, 28, april, 1910, by, the, lords, and, received, the, royal, assent, on, the, 29th, subsequently, the, parliament, act, 1911, removed, the, house, of, lords, power, to, block, money, bills, and, with, a, few, exceptions, replaced, their, veto, power, over, most, bills, with, a, power, to, delay, them, for, up, to, two, years, although, old, age, pensions, had, already, been, introduced, by, asquith, as, chancellor, lloyd, george, was, largely, responsible, for, the, introduction, of, state, financial, support, for, the, sick, and, infirm, known, colloquially, as, going, on, the, lloyd, george, for, decades, afterwards, legislation, referred, to, as, the, liberal, reforms, lloyd, george, also, succeeded, in, putting, through, parliament, his, national, insurance, act, 1911, making, provision, for, sickness, and, invalidism, and, a, system, of, unemployment, insurance, he, was, helped, in, his, endeavours, by, forty, or, so, backbenchers, who, regularly, pushed, for, new, social, measures, often, voted, with, labour, mps, these, social, reforms, in, britain, were, the, beginnings, of, a, welfare, state, and, fulfilled, the, aim, of, dampening, down, the, demands, of, the, growing, working, class, for, rather, more, radical, solutions, to, their, impoverishment, under, his, leadership, after, 1909, the, liberals, extended, minimum, wages, to, farmworkers, lloyd, george, was, an, opponent, of, warfare, but, he, paid, little, attention, to, foreign, affairs, until, the, agadir, crisis, of, 1911, after, consulting, edward, grey, the, foreign, minister, and, h, h, asquith, the, prime, minister, he, gave, a, stirring, and, patriotic, speech, at, mansion, house, on, 21, july, 1911, he, stated, but, if, a, situation, were, to, be, forced, upon, us, in, which, peace, could, only, be, preserved, by, the, surrender, of, the, great, and, beneficent, position, britain, has, won, by, centuries, of, heroism, and, achievement, by, allowing, britain, to, be, treated, where, her, interests, were, vitally, affected, as, if, she, were, of, no, account, in, the, cabinet, of, nations, then, i, say, emphatically, that, peace, at, that, price, would, be, a, humiliation, intolerable, for, a, great, country, like, ours, to, endure, national, honour, is, no, party, question, the, security, of, our, great, international, trade, is, no, party, question, he, was, warning, both, france, and, germany, but, the, public, response, cheered, solidarity, with, france, and, hostility, toward, germany, berlin, was, outraged, blaming, lloyd, george, for, doing, untold, harm, both, with, regard, to, german, public, opinion, and, the, negotiations, count, metternich, germany, s, ambassador, in, london, said, mr, lloyd, george, s, speech, came, upon, us, like, a, thunderbolt, in, 1913, lloyd, george, along, with, rufus, isaacs, the, attorney, general, was, involved, in, the, marconi, scandal, accused, of, speculating, in, marconi, shares, on, the, inside, information, that, they, were, about, to, be, awarded, a, key, government, contract, which, would, have, caused, them, to, increase, in, value, he, told, the, house, of, commons, that, he, had, not, speculated, in, the, shares, of, that, company, he, had, in, fact, bought, shares, in, the, american, marconi, company, lloyd, george, was, instrumental, in, fulfilling, a, long, standing, aspiration, to, disestablish, the, anglican, church, of, wales, as, with, irish, home, rule, previous, attempts, to, enact, this, had, failed, in, the, 1892, 1895, governments, and, were, now, made, possible, by, the, removal, of, the, lords, veto, in, 1911, and, as, with, home, rule, the, initial, bill, 1912, was, delayed, for, two, years, by, the, lords, becoming, law, in, 1914, only, to, be, suspended, for, the, duration, of, the, war, after, the, welsh, church, temporalities, act, 1919, was, passed, welsh, disestablishment, finally, came, into, force, in, 1920, this, act, also, removed, the, right, of, the, six, welsh, bishops, in, the, new, church, in, wales, to, sit, in, the, house, of, lords, and, removed, disendowed, certain, pre, 1662, property, rights, 18, 20, 42, lloyd, george, was, as, surprised, as, almost, everyone, else, by, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, on, 23, july, 1914, almost, a, month, after, the, assassination, of, archduke, franz, ferdinand, of, austria, and, on, the, eve, of, the, austro, hungarian, ultimatum, to, serbia, he, made, a, speech, advocating, economy, in, the, house, of, commons, saying, that, britain, s, relations, with, germany, were, better, than, for, many, years, 325, 326, on, 27, july, he, told, c, p, scott, of, the, manchester, guardian, that, britain, would, keep, out, of, the, impending, war, with, the, cabinet, divided, and, most, ministers, reluctant, for, britain, to, get, involved, he, struck, asquith, as, statesmanlike, at, the, cabinet, meeting, on, 1, august, favouring, keeping, britain, s, options, open, the, next, day, he, seemed, likely, to, resign, if, britain, intervened, but, he, held, back, at, cabinet, on, monday, 3, august, moved, by, the, news, that, belgium, would, resist, germany, s, demand, of, passage, for, her, army, across, her, soil, he, was, seen, as, a, key, figure, whose, stance, helped, to, persuade, almost, the, entire, cabinet, to, support, british, intervention, 327, 329, he, was, able, to, give, the, more, pacifist, members, of, the, cabinet, and, the, liberal, party, a, principle, the, rights, of, small, nations, which, meant, they, could, support, the, war, and, maintain, united, political, and, popular, support, lloyd, george, remained, in, office, as, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, for, the, first, year, of, the, great, war, the, budget, of, 17, november, 1914, had, to, allow, for, lower, taxation, receipts, because, of, the, reduction, in, world, trade, the, crimean, and, boer, wars, had, largely, been, paid, for, out, of, taxation, but, lloyd, george, raised, debt, financing, of, 321, million, large, but, deferred, increases, in, supertax, and, income, tax, rates, were, accompanied, by, increases, in, excise, duties, and, the, budget, produced, a, tax, increase, of, 63, million, in, a, full, year, 174, 175, his, last, budget, on, 4, may, 1915, showed, a, growing, concern, for, the, effects, of, alcohol, on, the, war, effort, with, large, increases, in, duties, and, a, scheme, of, state, control, of, alcohol, sales, in, specified, areas, the, excise, proposals, were, opposed, by, the, irish, nationalists, and, the, conservatives, and, were, abandoned, 175, 176, lloyd, george, gained, a, heroic, reputation, with, his, energetic, work, as, minister, of, munitions, in, 1915, and, 1916, setting, the, stage, for, his, move, up, to, the, height, of, power, after, a, long, struggle, with, the, war, office, he, wrested, responsibility, for, arms, production, away, from, the, generals, making, it, a, purely, industrial, department, with, considerable, expert, assistance, from, walter, runciman, the, two, men, gained, the, respect, of, liberal, cabinet, colleagues, for, improving, administrative, capabilities, and, increasing, outputs, when, the, shell, crisis, of, 1915, dismayed, public, opinion, with, the, news, that, the, army, was, running, short, of, artillery, shells, demands, rose, for, a, strong, leader, to, take, charge, of, munitions, in, the, first, coalition, ministry, formed, in, may, 1915, lloyd, george, was, made, minister, of, munitions, heading, a, new, department, in, this, position, he, won, great, acclaim, which, formed, the, basis, for, his, political, ascent, all, historians, agree, that, he, boosted, national, morale, and, focussed, attention, on, the, urgent, need, for, greater, output, but, many, also, say, the, increase, in, munitions, output, in, 1915, 16, was, due, largely, to, reforms, already, underway, though, not, yet, effective, before, he, had, even, arrived, the, ministry, broke, through, the, cumbersome, bureaucracy, of, the, war, office, resolved, labour, problems, rationalised, the, supply, system, and, dramatically, increased, production, within, a, year, it, became, the, largest, buyer, seller, and, employer, in, britain, lloyd, george, was, not, at, all, satisfied, with, the, progress, of, the, war, he, wanted, to, knock, away, the, props, by, attacking, germany, s, allies, from, early, in, 1915, he, argued, for, the, sending, of, british, troops, to, the, balkans, to, assist, serbia, and, bring, greece, and, other, balkan, countries, onto, the, side, of, the, allies, this, was, eventually, done, the, salonika, expedition, although, not, on, the, scale, that, lloyd, george, had, wanted, and, mountain, ranges, made, his, suggestions, of, grand, balkan, offensives, impractical, in, 1916, he, wanted, to, send, machine, guns, to, romania, insufficient, amounts, were, available, for, this, to, be, feasible, these, suggestions, began, a, period, of, poor, relations, with, the, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, general, robertson, who, was, brusque, to, the, point, of, rudeness, and, barely, concealed, his, contempt, for, lloyd, george, s, military, opinions, to, which, he, was, in, the, habit, of, retorting, i, ve, eard, different, lloyd, george, persuaded, kitchener, the, secretary, of, state, for, war, to, raise, a, welsh, division, and, despite, kitchener, s, threat, of, resignation, to, recognise, nonconformist, chaplains, in, the, army, late, in, 1915, lloyd, george, became, a, strong, supporter, of, general, conscription, an, issue, that, divided, liberals, and, helped, the, passage, of, several, conscription, acts, from, january, 1916, onwards, in, spring, 1916, alfred, milner, hoped, lloyd, george, could, be, persuaded, to, bring, down, the, coalition, government, by, resigning, but, this, did, not, happen, in, june, 1916, lloyd, george, succeeded, lord, kitchener, who, died, when, the, ship, hms, hampshire, was, sunk, taking, him, on, a, mission, to, russia, as, secretary, of, state, for, war, although, he, had, little, control, over, strategy, as, general, robertson, had, been, given, direct, right, of, access, to, the, cabinet, so, as, to, bypass, kitchener, he, did, succeed, in, securing, the, appointment, of, sir, eric, geddes, to, take, charge, of, military, railways, behind, british, lines, in, france, with, the, honorary, rank, of, major, general, lloyd, george, told, a, journalist, roy, w, howard, in, late, september, that, the, fight, must, be, to, a, finish, to, a, knockout, a, rejection, of, president, woodrow, wilson, s, offer, to, mediate, lloyd, george, was, increasingly, frustrated, at, the, limited, gains, of, the, somme, offensive, criticising, general, haig, to, ferdinand, foch, on, a, visit, to, the, western, front, in, september, british, casualty, ratios, were, worse, than, those, of, the, french, who, were, more, experienced, and, had, more, artillery, proposing, sending, robertson, on, a, mission, to, russia, he, refused, to, go, and, demanding, that, more, troops, be, sent, to, salonika, to, help, romania, robertson, eventually, threatened, to, resign, much, of, the, press, still, argued, that, the, professional, leadership, of, haig, and, robertson, was, preferable, to, civilian, interference, that, had, led, to, disasters, like, gallipoli, and, kut, lord, northcliffe, owner, of, the, times, stormed, into, lloyd, george, s, office, and, finding, him, unavailable, told, his, secretary, you, can, tell, him, that, i, hear, he, has, been, interfering, with, strategy, and, that, if, he, goes, on, i, will, break, him, and, the, same, day, 11, october, lloyd, george, also, received, a, warning, letter, from, h, a, gwynne, editor, of, the, morning, post, he, was, obliged, to, give, his, word, of, honour, to, asquith, that, he, had, complete, confidence, in, haig, and, robertson, and, thought, them, irreplaceable, but, he, wrote, to, robertson, wanting, to, know, how, their, differences, had, been, leaked, to, the, press, affecting, to, believe, that, robertson, had, not, personally, authorised, such, a, breach, of, confidence, discipline, he, asserted, his, right, to, express, his, opinions, about, strategy, in, november, by, which, time, ministers, had, taken, to, holding, meetings, to, which, robertson, was, not, invited, the, weakness, of, asquith, as, a, planner, and, organiser, was, increasingly, apparent, to, senior, officials, after, asquith, had, refused, then, agreed, to, and, then, refused, again, lloyd, george, s, demand, to, be, allowed, to, chair, a, small, committee, to, manage, the, war, he, resigned, in, december, 1916, grey, was, among, leading, asquithians, who, had, identified, lloyd, george, s, intentions, the, previous, month, lloyd, george, became, prime, minister, with, the, nation, demanding, he, take, vigorous, charge, of, the, war, although, during, the, political, crisis, robertson, had, advised, lloyd, george, to, stick, to, it, and, form, a, small, war, council, lloyd, george, had, planned, if, necessary, to, appeal, to, the, country, his, military, secretary, colonel, arthur, lee, prepared, a, memo, blaming, robertson, and, the, general, staff, for, the, loss, of, serbia, and, romania, lloyd, george, was, restricted, by, his, promise, to, the, unionists, to, keep, haig, as, commander, in, chief, and, the, press, support, for, the, generals, although, milner, and, curzon, were, also, sympathetic, to, campaigns, to, increase, british, power, in, the, middle, east, after, germany, s, offer, 12, december, 1916, of, a, negotiated, peace, lloyd, george, rebuffed, president, wilson, s, request, for, the, belligerents, to, state, their, war, aims, by, demanding, terms, tantamount, to, german, defeat, the, fall, of, asquith, as, prime, minister, split, the, liberal, party, into, two, factions, those, who, supported, him, and, those, who, supported, the, coalition, government, in, his, war, memoirs, lloyd, george, compared, himself, with, asquith, there, are, certain, indispensable, qualities, essential, to, the, chief, minister, of, the, crown, in, a, great, war, such, a, minister, must, have, courage, composure, and, judgment, all, this, mr, asquith, possessed, in, a, superlative, degree, but, a, war, minister, must, also, have, vision, imagination, and, initiative, he, must, show, untiring, assiduity, must, exercise, constant, oversight, and, supervision, of, every, sphere, of, war, activity, must, possess, driving, force, to, energize, this, activity, must, be, in, continuous, consultation, with, experts, official, and, unofficial, as, to, the, best, means, of, using, the, resources, of, the, country, in, conjunction, with, the, allies, for, the, achievement, of, victory, if, to, this, can, be, added, a, flair, for, conducting, a, great, fight, then, you, have, an, ideal, war, minister, after, december, 1916, lloyd, george, relied, on, the, support, of, conservatives, and, of, the, press, baron, lord, northcliffe, who, owned, both, the, times, and, the, daily, mail, besides, the, prime, minister, the, five, member, war, cabinet, contained, three, conservatives, lord, president, of, the, council, and, leader, of, the, house, of, lords, lord, curzon, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, and, leader, of, the, house, of, commons, bonar, law, and, minister, without, portfolio, lord, milner, and, arthur, henderson, unofficially, representing, labour, edward, carson, was, appointed, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, as, had, been, widely, touted, during, the, intrigues, of, the, previous, month, but, excluded, from, the, war, cabinet, amongst, the, few, liberal, frontbenchers, to, support, lloyd, george, were, christopher, addison, who, had, played, an, important, role, in, drumming, up, some, backbench, liberal, support, for, lloyd, george, h, a, l, fisher, lord, rhondda, and, sir, albert, stanley, edwin, montagu, and, churchill, joined, the, government, in, the, summer, of, 1917, lloyd, george, s, secretariat, popularly, known, as, downing, street, s, garden, suburb, assisted, him, in, discharging, his, responsibilities, within, the, constraints, of, the, war, cabinet, system, its, function, was, to, maintain, contact, with, the, numerous, departments, of, government, to, collect, information, and, to, report, on, matters, of, special, concern, its, leading, members, were, george, adams, and, philip, kerr, and, the, other, secretaries, included, david, davies, joseph, davies, waldorf, astor, and, later, cecil, harmsworth, lloyd, george, wanted, to, make, the, destruction, of, the, ottoman, empire, a, major, british, war, aim, and, two, days, after, taking, office, told, robertson, that, he, wanted, a, major, victory, preferably, the, capture, of, jerusalem, to, impress, british, public, opinion, at, the, rome, conference, 5, 6, january, 1917, lloyd, george, was, discreetly, quiet, about, plans, to, take, jerusalem, an, object, which, advanced, british, interests, rather, than, doing, much, to, win, the, war, lloyd, george, proposed, sending, heavy, guns, to, italy, with, a, view, to, defeating, austria, hungary, possibly, to, be, balanced, by, a, transfer, of, italian, troops, to, salonika, but, was, unable, to, obtain, the, support, of, the, french, or, italians, and, robertson, talked, of, resigning, lloyd, george, engaged, almost, constantly, in, intrigues, calculated, to, reduce, the, power, of, the, generals, including, trying, to, subordinate, british, forces, in, france, to, the, french, general, nivelle, he, backed, nivelle, because, he, thought, he, had, proved, himself, to, be, a, man, by, his, successful, counterattacks, at, verdun, and, because, of, his, promises, that, he, could, break, the, german, lines, in, 48, hours, nivelle, increasingly, complained, of, haig, s, dragging, his, feet, rather, than, cooperating, with, their, plans, for, the, offensive, the, plan, was, to, put, british, forces, under, nivelle, s, direct, command, for, the, great, 1917, offensive, the, british, would, attack, first, thereby, tying, down, the, german, reserves, then, the, french, would, strike, and, score, an, overwhelming, victory, in, two, days, it, was, announced, at, a, war, cabinet, meeting, on, 24, february, to, which, neither, robertson, nor, lord, derby, secretary, of, state, for, war, had, been, invited, ministers, felt, that, the, french, generals, and, staff, had, shown, themselves, more, skilful, than, the, british, in, 1916, whilst, politically, britain, had, to, give, wholehearted, support, to, what, would, probably, be, the, last, major, french, effort, of, the, war, the, nivelle, proposal, was, then, given, to, robertson, and, haig, without, warning, on, 26, 27, february, at, the, calais, conference, minutes, from, the, war, cabinet, meeting, were, not, sent, to, the, king, until, 28, february, so, that, he, did, not, have, a, prior, chance, to, object, robertson, in, particular, protested, vehemently, finally, a, compromise, was, reached, whereby, haig, would, be, under, nivelle, s, orders, but, would, retain, operational, control, of, british, forces, and, keep, a, right, of, appeal, to, london, if, he, saw, good, reason, after, further, argument, the, status, quo, that, haig, was, an, ally, of, the, french, but, was, expected, to, defer, to, their, wishes, was, largely, restored, in, mid, march, the, british, attack, at, the, battle, of, arras, 9, 14, april, 1917, was, partly, successful, but, with, much, higher, casualties, than, the, germans, suffered, there, had, been, many, delays, and, the, germans, suspecting, an, attack, had, shortened, their, lines, to, the, strong, hindenburg, line, the, french, attack, on, the, aisne, river, in, mid, april, gained, some, tactically, important, high, ground, but, failed, to, achieve, the, promised, decisive, breakthrough, pushing, the, french, army, to, the, point, of, mutiny, while, haig, gained, prestige, lloyd, george, lost, credibility, and, the, affair, further, poisoned, relations, between, himself, and, the, brasshats, in, early, 1917, the, germans, had, resumed, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, in, a, bid, to, achieve, victory, on, the, western, approaches, lloyd, george, set, up, a, ministry, of, shipping, under, sir, joseph, maclay, a, glasgow, shipowner, who, was, not, until, after, he, left, office, a, member, of, either, house, of, parliament, and, housed, in, a, wooden, building, in, a, specially, drained, lake, in, st, james, s, park, within, a, few, minutes, walk, from, the, admiralty, the, junior, minister, and, house, of, commons, spokesman, was, leo, chiozza, money, with, whom, maclay, did, not, get, on, but, on, whose, appointment, lloyd, george, insisted, feeling, that, their, qualities, would, complement, one, another, the, civil, service, staff, was, headed, by, the, highly, able, john, anderson, then, only, thirty, four, years, old, and, included, arthur, salter, a, number, of, shipping, magnates, were, persuaded, like, maclay, himself, to, work, unpaid, for, the, ministry, as, had, a, number, of, industrialists, for, the, ministry, of, munitions, who, were, also, able, to, obtain, ideas, privately, from, junior, naval, officers, who, were, reluctant, to, argue, with, their, superiors, in, meetings, the, ministers, heading, the, board, of, trade, for, munitions, addison, and, for, agriculture, and, food, lord, rhondda, were, also, expected, to, co, operate, with, maclay, 45, 47, 49, in, accordance, with, a, pledge, lloyd, george, had, given, in, december, 1916, nearly, 90, of, britain, s, merchant, shipping, tonnage, was, soon, brought, under, state, control, previously, less, than, half, had, been, controlled, by, the, admiralty, whilst, remaining, privately, owned, similar, measures, were, in, force, at, the, time, for, the, railways, merchant, shipping, was, concentrated, largely, on, chiozza, money, s, initiative, on, the, transatlantic, route, where, it, could, more, easily, be, protected, instead, of, being, spread, out, all, over, the, globe, this, relied, on, imports, coming, first, into, north, america, maclay, began, the, process, of, increasing, ship, construction, although, he, was, hampered, by, shortages, of, steel, and, labour, and, ships, under, construction, in, the, united, states, were, confiscated, by, the, americans, when, she, entered, the, war, in, may, 1917, eric, geddes, based, at, the, admiralty, was, put, in, charge, of, shipbuilding, and, in, july, he, became, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, 47, 49, later, the, german, u, boats, were, defeated, in, 1918, lloyd, george, had, raised, the, matter, of, convoys, at, the, war, committee, in, november, 1916, only, to, be, told, by, the, admirals, present, including, jellicoe, that, convoys, presented, too, large, a, target, and, that, merchant, ship, masters, lacked, the, discipline, to, keep, station, in, a, convoy, 49, 50, in, february, 1917, maurice, hankey, the, secretary, of, the, war, cabinet, wrote, a, memorandum, for, lloyd, george, calling, for, the, introduction, of, scientifically, organised, convoys, almost, certainly, after, being, persuaded, by, commander, reginald, henderson, and, the, shipping, ministry, officials, with, whom, he, was, in, contact, after, a, breakfast, meeting, 13, february, 1917, with, lloyd, george, sir, edward, carson, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, and, admirals, jellicoe, and, duff, agreed, to, conduct, experiments, however, convoys, were, not, in, general, use, until, august, by, which, time, the, rate, of, shipping, losses, was, already, in, decline, after, peaking, in, april, 51, 53, lloyd, george, later, claimed, in, his, war, memoirs, that, the, delay, in, introducing, convoys, was, because, the, admiralty, mishandled, an, experimental, convoy, between, britain, and, norway, and, because, jellicoe, obtained, behind, maclay, s, back, an, unrepresentative, sample, of, merchant, skippers, claiming, that, they, lacked, the, skill, to, keep, station, in, convoy, in, fact, hankey, s, diary, shows, that, lloyd, george, s, interest, in, the, matter, was, intermittent, whilst, frances, stevenson, s, diaries, contain, no, mention, of, the, topic, he, may, well, have, been, reluctant, especially, at, a, time, when, his, relations, with, the, generals, were, so, poor, for, a, showdown, with, carson, a, weak, administrator, who, was, as, much, the, mouthpiece, of, the, admirals, as, derby, was, of, the, generals, but, who, had, played, a, key, role, in, the, fall, of, asquith, and, who, led, a, significant, bloc, of, conservative, and, irish, unionist, mps, 50, 52, the, new, commander, of, the, grand, fleet, admiral, beatty, whom, lloyd, george, visited, at, invergordon, on, 15, april, was, a, supporter, of, convoys, as, was, the, american, admiral, sims, the, usa, had, just, entered, the, war, the, war, cabinet, on, 25, april, authorised, lloyd, george, to, look, into, the, anti, submarine, campaign, and, on, 30, april, he, visited, the, admiralty, duff, had, already, recommended, to, jellicoe, that, the, admiralty, adopt, convoys, after, a, recent, successful, convoy, from, gibraltar, 52, 53, most, of, the, organisations, lloyd, george, created, during, the, first, world, war, were, replicated, with, the, outbreak, of, the, second, world, war, as, lord, beaverbrook, wrote, there, were, no, road, signs, on, the, journey, he, had, to, undertake, the, latter, s, personal, efforts, to, promote, convoys, were, less, consistent, than, he, and, churchill, in, the, world, crisis, and, beaverbrook, in, men, and, power, later, claimed, the, idea, that, he, after, a, hard, struggle, sat, in, the, first, lord, s, chair, on, his, 30, april, visit, to, the, admiralty, and, imposed, convoys, on, a, hostile, board, is, a, myth, however, in, grigg, s, view, the, credit, goes, largely, to, men, and, institutions, which, he, set, in, place, and, with, a, freer, hand, and, making, fewer, mistakes, than, in, his, dealings, with, the, generals, he, and, his, appointees, took, decisions, which, can, reasonably, be, said, to, have, saved, the, country, it, was, a, close, run, thing, failure, would, have, been, catastrophic, 45, 49, 52, 53, lloyd, george, welcomed, the, fall, of, the, tsar, both, in, a, private, letter, to, his, brother, and, in, a, message, to, the, new, russian, prime, minister, prince, lvov, not, least, as, the, war, could, now, be, portrayed, as, a, clash, between, liberal, governments, and, the, autocratic, central, powers, like, many, observers, he, had, been, taken, by, surprise, by, the, exact, timing, of, the, revolution, it, had, not, been, predicted, by, lord, milner, or, general, wilson, on, their, visit, to, russia, a, few, weeks, earlier, and, hoped, albeit, with, some, concerns, that, russia, s, war, effort, would, be, invigorated, like, that, of, france, in, the, early, 1790s, 58, 59, lloyd, george, gave, a, cautious, welcome, to, the, suggestion, 19, march, on, the, western, calendar, by, the, russian, foreign, minister, pavel, milyukov, that, the, toppled, tsar, and, his, family, be, given, sanctuary, in, britain, although, lloyd, george, would, have, preferred, that, they, go, to, a, neutral, country, from, the, very, start, the, king, s, adviser, stamfordham, raised, objections, and, in, april, the, british, government, withdrew, its, consent, under, royal, pressure, eventually, the, russian, royal, family, were, moved, to, the, urals, where, they, were, executed, in, 1918, lloyd, george, was, often, blamed, for, the, refusal, of, asylum, and, in, his, war, memoirs, he, did, not, mention, king, george, v, s, role, in, the, matter, which, was, not, explicitly, confirmed, until, kenneth, rose, s, biography, of, the, king, was, published, in, 1983, 60, 61, an, imperial, war, cabinet, including, representatives, from, canada, newfoundland, australia, new, zealand, south, africa, and, india, met, 14, times, from, 20, march, 1917, to, 2, may, 1917, a, crisis, period, of, the, war, and, twice, in, 1918, the, idea, was, not, entirely, without, precedent, as, there, had, been, imperial, conferences, in, 1887, 1894, 1897, 1902, 1907, and, 1911, whilst, the, australian, prime, minister, billy, hughes, had, been, invited, to, attend, the, cabinet, and, war, committee, on, his, visit, to, the, uk, in, the, spring, of, 1916, the, south, african, jan, smuts, was, appointed, to, the, british, war, cabinet, in, the, early, summer, of, 1917, 61, 64, lloyd, george, set, up, a, war, policy, committee, himself, curzon, milner, law, and, smuts, with, maurice, hankey, as, secretary, to, discuss, strategy, which, held, 16, meetings, over, the, next, six, weeks, at, the, very, first, meeting, 11, june, lloyd, george, proposed, helping, the, italians, to, capture, trieste, explicitly, telling, the, war, policy, committee, 21, june, 1917, that, he, wanted, italian, soldiers, to, be, killed, rather, than, british, haig, believed, that, a, flanders, offensive, had, a, good, chance, of, clearing, the, belgian, coast, from, which, german, submarines, and, destroyers, were, operating, a, popular, goal, with, politicians, and, that, victory, at, ypres, might, quite, possibly, lead, to, german, collapse, robertson, was, less, optimistic, but, preferred, britain, to, keep, her, focus, on, defeating, germany, on, the, western, front, and, had, told, haig, that, the, politicians, would, not, dare, overrule, both, soldiers, if, they, gave, the, same, advice, haig, promised, he, had, no, intention, of, entering, into, a, tremendous, offensive, involving, heavy, losses, 20, june, whilst, robertson, wanted, to, avoid, disproportionate, loss, 23, june, the, flanders, offensive, was, reluctantly, sanctioned, by, the, war, policy, committee, on, 18, july, and, the, war, cabinet, two, days, later, on, condition, it, did, not, degenerate, into, a, long, drawn, out, fight, like, the, somme, the, war, cabinet, promised, to, monitor, progress, and, casualties, and, if, necessary, call, a, halt, although, in, the, event, they, made, little, effort, to, monitor, progress, until, september, frustrated, at, his, inability, to, get, his, way, lloyd, george, talked, of, resigning, and, taking, his, case, to, the, public, the, battle, of, passchendaele, began, on, 31, july, but, soon, became, bogged, down, in, unseasonably, early, wet, weather, which, turned, much, of, the, battlefield, into, a, barely, passable, swamp, in, which, men, and, animals, sometimes, drowned, whilst, the, mud, and, rain, severely, reduced, the, accuracy, and, effectiveness, of, artillery, the, dominant, weapon, of, the, time, lloyd, george, tried, to, enlist, the, king, for, diverting, efforts, against, austria, hungary, telling, stamfordham, 14, august, that, the, king, and, prime, minister, were, joint, trustees, of, the, nation, who, had, to, avoid, waste, of, manpower, a, new, italian, offensive, began, 18, august, but, robertson, advised, that, it, was, false, strategy, to, call, off, passchendaele, to, send, reinforcements, to, italy, and, despite, being, summoned, to, george, riddell, s, home, in, sussex, where, he, was, served, apple, pudding, his, favourite, dish, agreed, only, reluctantly, the, anglo, french, leadership, agreed, in, early, september, to, send, 100, heavy, guns, to, italy, 50, of, them, french, rather, than, the, 300, which, lloyd, george, wanted, lloyd, george, talked, of, ordering, a, halt, to, passchendaele, but, in, hankey, s, words, funked, it, 4, september, had, he, not, done, so, his, government, might, have, fallen, for, as, soon, as, the, guns, reached, italy, cadorna, called, off, his, offensive, 21, september, at, a, meeting, at, boulogne, on, the, 25th, of, september, lloyd, george, broached, with, painlev, the, setting, up, of, an, allied, supreme, war, council, then, making, foch, generalissimo, law, had, written, to, lloyd, george, that, ministers, must, soon, decide, whether, or, not, the, offensive, was, to, continue, lloyd, george, and, robertson, met, haig, in, france, 26, september, to, discuss, the, recent, german, peace, feelers, which, in, the, end, were, publicly, repudiated, by, chancellor, michaelis, and, the, progress, of, the, offensive, haig, preferred, to, continue, encouraged, by, plumer, s, recent, successful, attacks, in, dry, weather, at, menin, road, 20, september, and, polygon, wood, 26, september, and, stating, that, the, germans, were, very, worn, out, in, october, the, wet, weather, returned, for, the, final, attack, towards, passchendaele, at, the, final, meeting, of, the, war, policy, committee, on, 11, october, 1917, lloyd, george, authorised, the, offensive, to, continue, but, warning, of, failure, in, three, weeks, time, hankey, 21, october, claimed, in, his, diary, that, lloyd, george, had, deliberately, allowed, passchendaele, to, continue, to, discredit, haig, and, robertson, and, make, it, easier, for, him, to, forbid, similar, offensives, in, 1918, the, italians, suffered, a, disastrous, defeat, at, caporetto, requiring, british, and, french, reinforcements, to, be, sent, lloyd, george, said, he, wanted, to, take, advantage, of, caporetto, to, gain, control, of, the, war, the, supreme, war, council, was, inaugurated, at, the, rapallo, conference, 6, 7, november, 1917, lloyd, george, then, gave, a, controversial, speech, in, paris, 12, november, at, which, he, criticised, the, high, casualties, of, recent, allied, victories, a, word, which, he, used, with, an, element, of, sarcasm, these, events, led, to, an, angry, commons, debate, 19, november, which, lloyd, george, survived, in, reply, to, robertson, s, 19, november, memo, which, warned, correctly, that, the, germans, would, use, the, opportunity, of, russia, s, departure, from, the, war, to, attack, in, 1918, before, the, americans, were, present, in, strength, lloyd, george, wrote, wrongly, that, the, germans, would, not, attack, and, would, fail, if, they, did, that, autumn, he, declared, that, he, was, willing, to, risk, his, whole, political, reputation, to, avoid, a, repetition, of, the, somme, or, passchendaele, in, december, 1917, lloyd, george, remarked, to, c, p, scott, that, if, people, really, knew, the, war, would, be, stopped, tomorrow, but, of, course, they, don, t, know, and, can, t, know, a, manpower, committee, was, set, up, on, 6, december, 1917, consisting, of, the, prime, minister, curzon, carson, george, barnes, and, smuts, with, maurice, hankey, as, secretary, and, auckland, geddes, minister, of, national, service, in, charge, of, army, recruitment, in, regular, attendance, 366, the, first, meeting, of, the, manpower, committee, was, on, 10, december, and, it, met, twice, the, next, day, and, again, on, 15, december, lloyd, george, questioned, generals, macready, adjutant, general, and, macdonogh, chief, of, military, intelligence, who, advised, that, the, allied, superiority, of, numbers, on, the, western, front, would, not, survive, the, transfer, of, german, reinforcements, from, the, east, now, that, russia, was, dropping, out, of, the, war, deeply, concerned, about, the, publicity, attracted, by, the, recent, lansdowne, letter, s, mention, of, casualties, he, suggested, removing, haig, and, robertson, from, office, at, this, time, but, this, was, met, by, a, threat, of, resignation, from, lord, derby, at, this, stage, lloyd, george, opposed, extending, conscription, to, ireland, carson, advised, that, extending, conscription, to, ulster, alone, would, be, impractical, 366, 369, when, hankey, s, report, eventually, emerged, it, reflected, lloyd, george, s, wishes, it, gave, top, priority, to, shipbuilding, and, merchant, shipping, not, least, to, ship, us, troops, to, europe, and, placed, army, manpower, below, both, weapons, production, and, civilian, industry, the, size, of, the, army, in, britain, was, to, be, reduced, from, eight, divisions, to, four, freeing, about, 40, 000, men, for, service, in, france, 369, 370, in, the, house, of, commons, 20, december, lloyd, george, also, argued, that, the, collapse, of, russia, and, defeat, of, italy, required, further, combing, out, of, men, from, industry, in, breach, of, pledges, given, to, the, trade, unions, in, 1916, auckland, geddes, was, given, increased, powers, to, direct, labour, a, new, bill, became, law, despite, the, opposition, of, the, amalgamated, society, of, engineers, in, february, 1918, 369, 370, lloyd, george, outlined, allied, war, aims, at, a, conference, at, caxton, hall, on, 5, january, 1918, addressing, an, audience, of, trade, unionists, he, called, for, germany, to, be, stripped, of, her, conquests, including, her, colonies, and, alsace, lorraine, annexed, in, 1871, and, democratised, although, he, was, clear, that, this, was, not, an, allied, war, aim, something, which, would, help, to, ensure, the, future, peace, of, europe, and, for, the, liberation, of, the, subject, peoples, of, austria, hungary, and, the, ottoman, empire, he, also, hinted, at, reparations, although, it, was, suggested, that, these, would, not, be, on, the, scale, imposed, on, france, after, 1871, and, a, new, international, order, lloyd, george, explained, to, critics, that, he, was, hoping, to, detach, austria, hungary, and, turn, the, german, people, against, her, rulers, the, speech, greatly, increased, his, support, amongst, trade, unions, and, the, labour, party, 380, 383, president, wilson, at, first, considered, abandoning, his, speech, outlining, us, war, aims, the, fourteen, points, many, of, which, were, similar, to, the, aims, outlined, by, lloyd, george, but, was, persuaded, by, his, adviser, colonel, house, to, deliver, it, wilson, s, speech, 8, january, overshadowed, lloyd, george, s, and, is, better, remembered, by, posterity, 383, 385, lloyd, george, told, edmund, allenby, who, was, appointed, the, new, commander, in, egypt, in, june, that, his, objective, was, jerusalem, before, christmas, amidst, months, of, argument, throughout, the, autumn, of, 1917, robertson, was, able, to, block, lloyd, george, s, plan, to, make, palestine, the, main, theatre, of, operations, by, having, allenby, make, the, impossible, demand, that, thirteen, extra, divisions, be, sent, to, him, allenby, captured, jerusalem, in, december, 1917, in, the, winter, of, 1917, 18, lloyd, george, secured, the, resignations, of, both, the, service, chiefs, removing, the, first, sea, lord, admiral, jellicoe, earlier, in, 1917, as, lloyd, george, wanted, would, have, been, politically, impossible, given, conservative, anger, at, the, return, of, churchill, still, blamed, for, the, dardanelles, to, office, as, minister, of, munitions, in, july, and, lloyd, george, s, preoccupations, with, passchendaele, caporetto, and, the, supreme, war, council, from, july, onward, by, december, it, was, clear, that, lloyd, george, would, have, to, sack, jellicoe, or, lose, eric, geddes, first, lord, of, the, admiralty, who, wanted, to, return, to, his, previous, job, in, charge, of, military, transport, in, france, the, christmas, holiday, when, parliament, was, not, sitting, provided, a, good, opportunity, before, jellicoe, left, for, leave, on, christmas, eve, he, received, a, letter, from, geddes, demanding, his, resignation, the, other, sea, lords, talked, of, resigning, but, did, not, do, so, whilst, jellicoe, s, ally, carson, remained, a, member, of, the, war, cabinet, until, he, resigned, in, january, over, irish, home, rule, 371, 376, relations, with, general, robertson, had, worsened, further, over, the, creation, of, the, supreme, war, council, at, versailles, and, he, was, eventually, forced, out, over, his, insistence, that, the, british, delegate, there, be, subordinate, to, robertson, as, cigs, in, london, as, prime, minister, lloyd, george, played, a, pivotal, role, in, the, establishment, of, a, jewish, national, home, in, palestine, his, government, issued, the, balfour, declaration, in, 1917, announcing, an, official, british, commitment, to, support, an, eventual, jewish, homeland, in, palestine, lloyd, george, led, the, war, effort, against, the, ottomans, whose, empire, was, broken, up, and, taken, over, in, large, part, by, britain, and, france, britain, took, over, palestine, he, presided, over, the, imperial, cabinet, when, it, endorsed, this, policy, and, he, secured, the, backing, of, britain, s, allies, especially, the, united, states, and, france, he, was, also, the, principal, delegate, at, the, san, remo, conference, in, 1920, where, the, league, of, nations, designed, the, mandate, for, palestine, and, conferred, it, upon, britain, zionist, leader, chaim, weizmann, said, lloyd, george, initiated, the, balfour, declaration, and, followed, the, development, of, the, zionist, movement, and, the, upbuilding, of, palestine, with, keen, interest, in, every, stage, the, war, cabinet, was, a, very, successful, innovation, it, met, almost, daily, with, maurice, hankey, as, secretary, and, made, all, major, political, military, economic, and, diplomatic, decisions, rationing, was, finally, imposed, in, early, 1918, for, meat, sugar, and, fats, butter, and, margarine, but, not, bread, the, new, system, worked, smoothly, from, 1914, to, 1918, trade, union, membership, doubled, from, a, little, over, four, million, to, a, little, over, eight, million, work, stoppages, and, strikes, became, frequent, in, 1917, 18, as, the, unions, expressed, grievances, regarding, prices, alcohol, control, pay, disputes, dilution, of, labour, fatigue, from, overtime, and, from, sunday, work, and, inadequate, housing, the, corn, production, act, 1917, bestowed, upon, the, board, of, agriculture, the, power, to, ensure, that, all, land, was, properly, cultivated, appointed, a, wages, board, to, operate, a, new, minimum, wage, in, agriculture, and, guaranteed, minimum, prices, for, wheat, and, oats, conscription, put, into, uniform, nearly, every, physically, fit, man, six, million, out, of, ten, million, eligible, of, these, about, 750, 000, died, and, 1, 7, million, were, wounded, most, deaths, were, of, young, unmarried, men, however, 160, 000, wives, lost, their, husbands, and, 300, 000, children, lost, their, fathers, in, rapid, succession, in, spring, 1918, came, a, series, of, military, and, political, crises, the, germans, having, moved, troops, from, the, eastern, front, and, retrained, them, in, new, tactics, now, had, more, soldiers, on, the, western, front, than, the, allies, germany, launched, the, full, scale, spring, offensive, starting, on, 21, march, against,

facing, defeat, london, realised, it, needed, more, troops, to, fight, a, mobile, war, lloyd, george, found, half, a, million, soldiers, and, rushed, them, to, france, asked, american, president, woodrow, wilson, for, immediate, help, and, agreed, to, the, appointment, of, french, general, foch, as, commander, in, chief, on, the, western, front, he, considered, taking, on, the, role, of, war, minister, himself, but, was, dissuaded, by, the, king, and, instead, appointed, lord, milner, 478, 483, despite, strong, warnings, that, it, was, a, bad, idea, the, war, cabinet, decided, to, impose, conscription, on, ireland, the, main, reason, was, that, trade, unions, in, britain, demanded, it, as, the, price, for, cutting, back, on, conscription, exemptions, for, certain, workers, labour, wanted, the, principle, established, that, no, one, was, exempt, but, it, did, not, demand, that, conscription, actually, take, place, in, ireland, the, proposal, was, enacted, but, never, enforced, the, catholic, bishops, for, the, first, time, entered, the, fray, and, called, for, open, resistance, to, conscription, many, irish, catholics, and, nationalists, moved, into, sinn, f, in, a, decisive, moment, marking, the, dominance, of, irish, politics, by, a, party, committed, to, leaving, the, uk, altogether, 465, 488, at, one, point, lloyd, george, unknowingly, misled, the, house, of, commons, in, claiming, that, haig, s, forces, were, stronger, at, the, start, of, 1918, than, they, had, been, a, year, earlier, in, fact, the, increase, was, in, the, number, of, labourers, most, of, them, chinese, indians, and, black, south, africans, and, haig, had, fewer, infantry, holding, a, longer, stretch, of, front, the, prime, minister, had, used, incorrect, information, furnished, by, the, war, department, office, headed, by, major, general, sir, frederick, maurice, maurice, then, made, the, spectacular, public, allegation, that, the, war, cabinet, had, deliberately, held, soldiers, back, from, the, western, front, and, both, lloyd, george, and, law, had, lied, to, parliament, about, it, instead, of, going, to, the, prime, minister, about, the, problem, maurice, had, waited, and, then, broke, king, s, regulations, by, making, a, public, attack, asquith, still, the, liberal, party, leader, took, up, the, allegations, and, called, for, a, parliamentary, inquiry, while, asquith, s, presentation, was, poorly, done, lloyd, george, vigorously, defended, his, position, treating, the, debate, as, a, vote, of, confidence, he, won, over, the, house, with, a, powerful, refutation, of, maurice, s, allegations, the, liberal, party, was, openly, split, for, the, first, time, meanwhile, the, german, offensive, stalled, by, summer, the, americans, were, sending, 10, 000, fresh, men, a, day, to, the, western, front, a, speedup, made, possible, by, leaving, their, equipment, behind, and, using, british, and, french, munitions, the, german, army, had, used, up, its, last, reserves, and, was, steadily, shrinking, in, numbers, further, weakening, its, resolve, victory, came, on, 11, november, 1918, that, autumn, lloyd, george, was, one, of, the, many, infected, during, the, 1918, flu, pandemic, but, he, survived, at, the, end, of, the, war, lloyd, george, s, reputation, stood, at, its, zenith, law, who, was, also, from, a, provincial, background, said, he, can, be, prime, minister, for, life, if, he, likes, 325, headlines, at, this, time, declared, a, huge, majority, win, and, that, pacifists, even, shining, lights, such, as, arnold, lupton, had, been, completely, overthrown, by, ramsay, macdonald, and, philip, snowden, in, the, coupon, election, of, december, 1918, he, led, a, coalition, of, conservatives, and, his, own, faction, of, liberals, to, a, landslide, victory, coalition, candidates, received, a, coalition, coupon, an, endorsement, letter, signed, by, lloyd, george, and, law, he, did, not, say, we, shall, squeeze, the, german, lemon, until, the, pips, squeak, that, was, sir, eric, geddes, but, he, did, express, that, sentiment, about, reparations, from, germany, to, pay, the, entire, cost, of, the, war, including, pensions, he, said, that, german, industrial, capacity, will, go, a, pretty, long, way, we, must, have, the, uttermost, farthing, and, shall, search, their, pockets, for, it, as, the, campaign, closed, he, summarised, his, programme, the, election, was, fought, not, so, much, on, the, peace, issue, and, what, to, do, with, germany, although, those, themes, played, a, role, more, important, was, the, voters, evaluation, of, lloyd, george, in, terms, of, what, he, had, accomplished, so, far, and, what, he, promised, for, the, future, his, supporters, emphasised, that, he, had, won, the, great, war, against, his, strong, record, in, social, legislation, he, himself, called, for, making, a, country, fit, for, heroes, to, live, in, the, coalition, gained, an, overwhelming, victory, winning, 525, of, the, 707, seats, contested, however, the, conservatives, had, more, than, two, thirds, of, the, coalition, s, seats, asquith, s, independent, liberals, were, crushed, although, they, were, still, the, official, opposition, as, the, two, liberal, factions, combined, had, more, seats, than, labour, accounts, vary, about, the, factional, allegiance, of, some, mps, by, some, accounts, as, few, as, 29, uncouponed, liberals, had, been, elected, only, 3, with, any, junior, ministerial, experience, and, only, 23, of, them, were, actually, opponents, of, the, coalition, until, april, 1919, the, government, whip, was, extended, to, all, liberal, mps, and, lloyd, george, might, easily, have, been, elected, chairman, of, the, liberal, mps, asquith, was, still, party, leader, but, had, lost, his, seat, had, he, been, willing, to, antagonise, his, conservative, coalition, partners, by, doing, so, lloyd, george, represented, britain, at, the, paris, peace,

george, on, the, whole, stood, on, the, side, of, generosity, and, moderation, he, did, not, want, to, utterly, destroy, the, german, economy, and, political, system, as, clemenceau, demanded, with, massive, reparations, the, economist, john, maynard, keynes, looked, askance, at, lloyd, george, s, economic, credentials, in, the, economic, consequences, of, the, peace, and, in, essays, in, biography, called, the, prime, minister, a, goat, footed, bard, half, human, visitor, to, our, age, from, the, hag, ridden, magic, and, enchanted, woods, of, celtic, antiquity, lloyd, george, was, also, responsible, for, the, pro, german, shift, in, the, peace, conditions, regarding, borders, of, poland, instead, of, handing, over, upper, silesia, 2, 073, 000, people, and, the, southern, part, of, east, prussia, 720, 000, people, to, poland, as, was, planned, before, the, plebiscite, was, organised, danzig, 366, 000, people, was, organised, as, the, free, city, of, danzig, the, poles, were, grateful, that, he, had, saved, that, country, from, the, bolsheviks, but, were, annoyed, by, his, comment, that, they, were, children, who, gave, trouble, distrusting, foreign, office, professionals, lloyd, george, and, his, team, at, paris, instead, relied, on, non, professional, experts, through, informal, networks, below, them, they, consulted, with, james, headlam, morley, about, danzig, several, academic, historians, also, were, consulted, their, experiences, were, the, basis, for, building, up, diplomatic, history, as, a, field, of, academic, research, and, the, emergence, of, the,

accord, with, british, interest, in, a, continental, balance, of, power, a, major, programme, of, social, reform, was, introduced, under, lloyd, george, in, the, last, months, of, the, war, and, in,

it, extended, unemployment, insurance, to, almost, the, entire, labour, force, whereas, only, certain, categories, of, workers, had, been, covered, before, as, a, result, of, this, legislation, roughly, three, quarters, of, the, british, workforce, were, now, covered, by, unemployment, insurance, the, agriculture, act, 1920, provided, for, farm, labourers, to, receive, a, minimum, wage,

the, pre, war, liberal, governments, however, the, reform, programme, was, substantially, rolled, back, by, the, geddes, axe, which, cut, public, expenditure, by, 76, million, including, substantial, cuts, to, education, and, abolished, the, agricultural, wages, board, as, early, as, 1913, lloyd, george, expressed, interest, in, the, issues, surrounding, the, of, irish, home, rule, movement, he, stated, that, he, supported, the, principle, of, a, referendum, each, of, the, ulster, counties, is, to, have, the, option, of, exclusion, from, the, home, rule, bill, had, a, referendum, occurred,

harsh, repression, key, leaders, were, quickly, executed, the, mostly, catholic, irish, nationalists, then, underwent, a, dramatic, change, of, mood, and, shifted, to, demand, vengeance, and, independence, in, 1917, lloyd, george, called, the, 1917, 18, irish, convention, in, an, attempt, to, settle, the, outstanding, home, rule, for, ireland, issue, however, the, upsurge, in, republican, sympathies, in, ireland, following, the, easter, rising, coupled, with, lloyd, george, s, disastrous, attempt, to, extend, conscription, to, ireland, in, april, 1918, and, led, to, the, landslide, victory, of, sinn, f, in, and, the, wipeout, of, the, irish, parliamentary, party, at, the, december, 1918, election, replaced, by, sinn, f, in, mps, they, immediately, declared, an, irish, republic, lloyd, george, presided, over, the, government, of, ireland, act, 1920, which, partitioned, ireland, into, southern, ireland, and, northern, ireland, in, may, 1921, during, the, anglo, irish, war, lloyd, george, famously, declared, of, the, irish, republican, army, that, we, have, murder, by, the, throat, however, he, soon, afterwards, began, negotiations, with, ira, leaders, to, recognise, their, authority, and, to, end, a, bloody, conflict, lloyd, george, also, invited, the, leader, of, northern, irish, unionists, james, craig, to, the, negotiations, but, he, refused, to, attend, lloyd, george, wrote, to, craig, on, 14, november, 1921, your, proposal, to, leave, the, six, counties, under, the, northern, parliament, would, stereotype, a, frontier, based, neither, upon, natural, features, nor, broad, geographical, considerations, by, giving, it, the, character, of, an, international, boundary, partition, upon, these, lines, the, majority, of, the, irish, people, will, never, accept, nor, could, we, conscientiously, attempt, to, enforce, it, see, the, troubles, in, northern, ireland, 1920, 1922, the, anglo, irish, treaty, was, signed, in, december, 1921, with, irish, leaders, the, parliament, of, northern, ireland, exercised, article, 12, of, the, treaty, to, opt, out, of, the, irish, free, state, the, treaty, established, the, irish, boundary, commission, to, draw, a, border, between, northern, ireland, and, the, rest, of, ireland, in, accordance, with, the, wishes, of, the, inhabitants, so, far, as, may, be, compatible, with, economic, and, geographic, conditions, southern, ireland, representing, over, a, fifth, of, the, united, kingdom, s, territory, seceded, in, 1922, to, form, the, irish, free, state, see, partition, of, ireland, in, 1921, lloyd, george, successfully, concluded, the, anglo, soviet, trade, agreement, despite, much, effort, he, was, unable, to, negotiate, full, diplomatic, relations, as, the, russians, rejected, all, repayment, of, tsarist, era, debts, and, conservatives, in, britain, grew, exceedingly, wary, of, the, communist, threat, to, european, stability, indeed, henry, wilson, the, chief, of, the, imperial, general, staff, worried, that, lloyd, george, had, become, a, traitor, a, bolshevist, 276, 279, lloyd, george, in, 1922, decided, to, support, greece, in, a, war, against, turkey, this, led, to, the, chanak, crisis, when, most, of, the, dominions, rejected, his, policy, and, refused, to, support, the, proposed, war, the, more, conservative, wing, of, the, unionist, party, had, no, intention, of, introducing, reforms, which, led, to, three, years, of, frustrated, fighting, within, the, coalition, both, between, the, national, liberals, and, the, unionists, and, between, factions, within, the, conservatives, themselves, many, conservatives, were, angered, by, the, granting, of, independence, to, the, irish, free, state, and, by, edwin, montagu, s, moves, towards, limited, self, government, for, india, while, a, sharp, economic, downturn, and, wave, of, strikes, in, 1921, damaged, lloyd, george, s, credibility, the, cash, for, patronage, scandal, erupted, in, 1922, when, it, became, known, that, lloyd, george, had, essentially, sold, peerages, from, 1917, to, 1922, more, than, 120, hereditary, peers, were, created, and, lesser, honours, such, as, knighthoods, with, a, price, list, for, peerages, 10, 000, for, a, knighthood, 40, 000, for, a, baronetcy, to, raise, funds, for, his, party, via, maundy, gregory, this, was, not, illegal, at, the, time, a, major, attack, in, the, house, of, lords, on, his, corruption, followed, resulting, in, the, honours, prevention, of, abuses, act, 1925, other, complaints, were, that, the, cabinet, contained, too, many, scots, too, few, men, from, oxbridge, and, the, great, public, schools, too, many, businessmen, and, too, few, gentlemen, 330, 331, the, coalition, was, dealt, its, final, blow, in, october, 1922, the, conservatives, felt, let, down, by, france, over, the, chanak, crisis, with, law, telling, france, we, cannot, act, alone, as, the, policeman, of, the, world, the, conservative, leader, austen, chamberlain, summoned, a, meeting, of, conservative, members, of, parliament, at, the, carlton, club, to, discuss, their, attitude, to, the, coalition, in, the, forthcoming, election, chamberlain, and, most, conservative, leaders, supported, lloyd, george, however, the, rank, and, file, rejected, the, coalition, the, main, attack, came, from, stanley, baldwin, then, president, of, the, board, of, trade, who, spoke, of, lloyd, george, as, a, dynamic, force, who, would, break, the, conservative, party, they, sealed, lloyd, george, s, fate, on, 19, october, 1922, by, voting, in, favour, of, the, motion, to, end, the, coalition, and, fight, the, election, as, an, independent, party, with, its, own, leader, and, its, own, programme, lloyd, george, submitted, his, resignation, to, the, king, that, afternoon, throughout, the, 1920s, lloyd, george, remained, highly, visible, in, politics, predictions, that, he, would, return, to, power, were, common, but, it, never, happened, he, still, controlled, a, large, fund, thought, to, have, been, between, 1m, equivalent, to, 50, 700, 000, in, 2023, and, 3m, equivalent, to, 152, 200, 000, in, 2023, from, his, investments, in, newspaper, ownership, and, from, his, sale, of, titles, before, the, 1923, election, he, resolved, his, dispute, with, asquith, allowing, the, liberals, to, run, a, united, ticket, against, stanley, baldwin, s, policy, of, protective, tariffs, baldwin, both, feared, and, despised, lloyd, george, and, one, of, his, aims, was, to, keep, him, out, of, power, he, later, claimed, that, he, had, adopted, tariffs, which, cost, the, conservatives, their, majority, out, of, concern, that, lloyd, george, was, about, to, do, so, on, his, return, from, a, tour, of, north, america, although, there, was, press, speculation, at, the, time, that, lloyd, george, would, do, so, or, adopt, us, style, prohibition, to, appeal, to, newly, enfranchised, women, voters, there, is, no, evidence, that, this, was, his, intent, asquith, and, lloyd, george, reached, agreement, on, 13, november, 1923, and, issued, a, joint, free, trade, manifesto, followed, by, a, more, general, one, lloyd, george, agreed, to, contribute, 100, 000, in, the, event, he, claimed, to, have, contributed, 160, 000, including, help, given, to, individual, candidates, liberal, hq, put, the, figure, at, 90, 000, in, 1924, lloyd, george, realising, that, liberal, defeat, was, inevitable, and, keen, to, take, control, of, the, party, himself, spent, only, 60, 000, 631, at, the, 1924, general, election, baldwin, won, a, clear, victory, despite, having, a, large, majority, he, appointed, the, leading, coalitionists, such, as, austen, chamberlain, and, lord, birkenhead, and, former, liberal, winston, churchill, to, senior, cabinet, places, to, discourage, any, restoration, of, the, 1916, 1922, coalition, the, disastrous, election, result, in, 1924, left, the, liberals, as, a, weak, third, party, in, british, politics, behind, the, ascendant, labour, party, with, just, over, 40, mps, although, asquith, who, had, again, lost, his, seat, and, was, created, an, earl, remained, liberal, leader, lloyd, george, was, elected, chairman, of, the, liberal, mps, by, 26, votes, to, 7, sir, john, simon, and, his, followers, were, still, loyal, to, asquith, after, 1931, simon, would, lead, a, breakaway, national, liberal, party, which, eventually, merged, with, the, conservatives, whilst, walter, runciman, led, a, separate, radical, group, within, the, parliamentary, party, lloyd, george, was, now, mainly, interested, in, the, reform, of, land, ownership, but, had, only, been, permitted, to, put, a, brief, paragraph, about, it, in, the, hastily, drafted, 1924, liberal, manifesto, in, the, autumn, of, 1925, despite, the, hostility, of, charles, hobhouse, runciman, and, alfred, mond, he, began, an, independent, campaign, soon, to, become, the, land, and, the, nation, the, green, book, first, of, a, series, of, policy, papers, produced, by, lloyd, george, in, the, late, 1920s, asquith, rebuked, him, but, was, ignored, they, reached, an, agreement, in, principle, on, 2, december, then, together, they, presented, lloyd, george, s, plans, to, the, national, liberal, federation, on, 26, february, 1926, the, liberal, shadow, cabinet, including, lloyd, george, unequivocally, backed, baldwin, s,

with, the, money, the, results, at, the, 1929, general, election, were, disappointing, the, liberals, increased, their, support, only, to, 59, seats, while, labour, became, the, largest, party, for,

commons, an, honorific, position, without, power, in, 1931, an, illness, prevented, lloyd, george, s, joining, the, national, government, when, it, was, formed, when, the, national, government, later, called, a, general, election, he, tried, to, pull, the, liberal, party, out, of, it, but, succeeded, in, taking, only, a, few, followers, most, of, whom, were, related, to, him, the, main, liberal, party, remained, in, the, coalition, for, a, year, longer, under, the, leadership, of, sir, herbert, samuel, by, the, 1930s, lloyd, george, was, on, the, margins, of, british, politics, although, still, intermittently, in, the, public, eye, and, publishing, his, war, memoirs, in, january, 1935, lloyd, george, announced, a, programme, of, economic, reform, called, lloyd, george, s, new, deal, after, the, american, new, deal, this, keynesian, economic, programme, was, essentially, the, same, as, that, of, 1929, macdonald, requested, that, he, put, his, case, before, the, cabinet, in, march, lloyd, george, submitted, a, 100, page, memorandum, published, as, organizing, prosperity, a, scheme, of, national, reconstruction, that, was, cross, examined, between, april, and, june, in, ten, meetings, of, the, cabinet, s, sub, committee, however, the, programme, did, not, find, favour, two, thirds, of, conservative, mps, were, against, lloyd, george, joining, the, national, government, and, some, cabinet, members, would, have, resigned, if, he, had, joined, 238, 239, lloyd, george, was, consistently, pro, german, after, 1923, in, part, due, to, his, growing, conviction, that, germany, had, been, treated, unfairly, at, versailles, he, supported, german, demands, for, territorial, concessions, and, recognition, of, its, great, power, status, he, paid, much, less, attention, to, the, security, concerns, of, france, poland, czechoslovakia, and, belgium, in, a, speech, in, 1933, he, warned, that, if, adolf, hitler, were, overthrown, communism, would, replace, him, in, germany, in, august, 1934, he, insisted, germany, could, not, wage, war, and, assured, european, nations, that, there, would, be, no, risk, of, war, during, the, next, ten, years, in, september, 1936, he, visited, germany, to, talk, with, hitler, hitler, said, he, was, pleased, to, have, met, the, man, who, won, the, war, lloyd, george, was, moved, and, called, hitler, the, greatest, living, german, 247, lloyd, george, also, visited, germany, s, public, works, programmes, and, was, impressed, on, his, return, to, britain, he, wrote, an, article, for, the, daily, express, praising, hitler, and, stating, the, germans, have, definitely, made, up, their, minds, never, to, quarrel, with, us, again, 248, he, believed, hitler, was, the, george, washington, of, germany, that, he, was, rearming, germany, for, defence, and, not, for, offensive, war, that, a, war, between, germany, and, the, soviet, union, would, not, happen, for, at, least, ten, years, that, hitler, admired, the, british, and, wanted, their, friendship, but, that, there, was, no, british, leadership, to, exploit, this, however, by, 1937, lloyd, george, s, distaste, for, neville, chamberlain, led, him, to, disavow, chamberlain, s, appeasement, policies, 248, in, the, last, important, parliamentary, intervention, of, his, career, which, occurred, during, the, crucial, norway, debate, of, may, 1940, lloyd, george, made, a, powerful, speech, that, helped, to, undermine, chamberlain, as, prime, minister, and, to, pave, the, way, for, the, ascendancy, of, churchill, churchill, offered, lloyd, george, the, agriculture, portfolio, in, his, cabinet, initially, subject, to, chamberlain, s, approval, but, this, condition, and, once, chamberlain, had, withdrawn, his, opposition, lloyd, george, s, unwillingness, to, sit, alongside, chamberlain, led, him, to, refuse, 255, lloyd, george, also, thought, that, britain, s, chances, in, the, war, were, dim, and, he, remarked, to, his, secretary, i, shall, wait, until, winston, is, bust, a, pessimistic, speech, by, lloyd, george, on, 7, may, 1941, led, churchill, to, compare, him, with, philippe, p, tain, who, had, become, a, nazi, puppet, he, cast, his, last, vote, in, the, commons, on, 18, february, 1943, as, one, of, the, 121, mps, 97, labour, condemning, the, government, for, its, failure, to, back, the, beveridge, report, he, continued, to, attend, castle, street, baptist, chapel, in, london, but, by, 1944, he, was, weakening, rapidly, and, his, voice, failing, he, was, still, an, mp, but, concerned, about, his, health, he, felt, physically, unable, to, campaign, and, the, wartime, social, changes, in, the, constituency, he, feared, carnarvon, boroughs, might, go, conservative, at, the, next, election, it, was, announced, in, the, 1945, new, year, honours, that, lloyd, george, would, be, made, an, earl, which, he, was, as, earl, lloyd, george, of, dwyfor, and, viscount, gwynedd, of, dwyfor, in, the, county, of, caernarvonshire, on, 12, february, 1945, however, he, did, not, live, long, enough, to, take, his, seat, in, the, house, of, lords, lloyd, george, died, of, cancer, at, the, age, of, 82, on, 26, march, 1945, with, his, wife, frances, and, his, daughter, megan, at, his, bedside, four, days, later, on, good, friday, he, was, buried, beside, the, river, dwyfor, in, llanystumdwy, a, boulder, marks, the, grave, there, is, no, inscription, however, a, monument, designed, by, the, architect, sir, clough, williams, ellis, was, subsequently, erected, around, the, grave, bearing, an, englyn, strict, metre, stanza, engraved, on, slate, in, his, memory, composed, by, his, nephew, w, r, p, george, nearby, stands, the, lloyd, george, museum, also, designed, by, williams, ellis, and, opened, in, 1963, lloyd, george, has, often, been, ranked, highly, among, modern, british, prime, ministers, but, his, legacy, remains, complicated, and, controversial, scholars, have, praised, his, welfare, reforms, and, his, efforts, to, mobilise, and, lead, britain, to, victory, during, the, first, world, war, but, he, has, also, been, criticised, for, adopting, a, presidential, style, of, leadership, for, distrusting, his, own, commanders, during, the, war, and, for, his, strategic, failures, and, involvement, in, various, scandals, his, legacies, over, ireland, and, the, treaty, of, versailles, are, also, controversial, he, was, an, ardent, zionist, who, expressed, antisemitic, views, in, the, post, war, period, he, arguably, alienated, many, of, the, workers, he, had, earlier, championed, helping, to, swell, labour, s, popular, support, at, the, liberals, expense, not, helped, by, his, conflicts, with, asquithian, liberals, after, 1916, historian, martin, pugh, in, the, oxford, companion, to, british, history, argues, that, made, a, greater, impact, on, british, public, life, than, any, other, 20th, cent, statesman, he, laid, the, foundations, of, what, later, became, the, welfare, state, and, put, a, progressive, income, tax, system, at, the, centre, of, government, finance, he, also, left, his, mark, on, the, system, of, government, by, enlarging, the, scope, of, the, prime, minister, s, role, he, was, acclaimed, not, without, reason, as, the, man, who, won, the, war, he, was, blamed, by, many, liberals, for, destroying, their, party, in, 1918, hated, in, the, labour, movement, for, his, handling, of, industrial, issues, after, 1918, and, disparaged, by, conservatives, for, his, radicalism, george, riddell, 1st, baron, riddell, a, wealthy, newspaper, publisher, was, a, close, confidant, and, financial, supporter, of, lloyd, george, from, 1908, to, 1922, during, lloyd, george, s, first, year, as, prime, minister, in, summer, 1917, riddell, assessed, his, personality, in, his, diary, his, energy, capacity, for, work, and, power, of, recuperation, are, remarkable, he, has, an, extraordinary, memory, imagination, and, the, art, of, getting, at, the, root, of, a, matter, he, is, not, afraid, of, responsibility, and, has, no, respect, for, tradition, or, convention, he, is, always, ready, to, examine, scrap, or, revise, established, theories, and, practices, these, qualities, give, him, unlimited, confidence, in, himself, he, is, one, of, the, craftiest, of, men, and, his, extraordinary, charm, of, manner, not, only, wins, him, friends, but, does, much, to, soften, the, asperities, of, his, opponents, and, enemies, he, is, full, of, humour, and, a, born, actor, he, has, an, instinctive, power, of, divining, the, thoughts, and, intentions, of, people, with, whom, he, is, conversing, his, chief, defects, are, 1, lack, of, appreciation, of, existing, institutions, organisations, and, stolid, dull, people, their, ways, are, not, his, ways, and, their, methods, are, not, his, methods, 2, fondness, for, a, grandiose, scheme, in, preference, to, an, attempt, to, improve, existing, machinery, 3, disregard, of,
