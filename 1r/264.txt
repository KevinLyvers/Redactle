pierre, corneille, french, pronunciation, 6, june, 1606, 1, october, 1684, was, a, french, tragedian, he, is, generally, considered, one, of, the, three, great, 17th, century, french, dramatists, along, with, moli, re, and, racine, as, a, young, man, he, earned, the, valuable, patronage, of, cardinal, richelieu, who, was, trying, to, promote, classical, tragedy, along, formal, lines, but, later, quarrelled, with, him, especially, over, his, best, known, play, le, cid, about, a, medieval, spanish, warrior, which, was, denounced, by, the, newly, formed, acad, mie, fran, aise, for, breaching, the, unities, he, continued, to, write, well, received, tragedies, for, nearly, forty, years, corneille, was, born, in, rouen, normandy, france, to, marthe, le, pesant, and, pierre, corneille, a, distinguished, lawyer, his, younger, brother, thomas, corneille, also, became, a, noted, playwright, he, was, given, a, rigorous, jesuit, education, at, the, coll, ge, de, bourbon, lyc, e, pierre, corneille, since, 1873, where, acting, on, the, stage, was, part, of, the, training, at, 18, he, began, to, study, law, but, his, practical, legal, endeavours, were, largely, unsuccessful, corneille, s, father, secured, two, magisterial, posts, for, him, with, the, rouen, department, of, forests, and, rivers, during, his, time, with, the, department, he, wrote, his, first, play, it, is, unknown, exactly, when, he, wrote, it, but, the, play, the, comedy, m, lite, surfaced, when, corneille, brought, it, to, a, group, of, traveling, actors, in, 1629, the, actors, approved, of, the, work, and, made, it, part, of, their, repertoire, the, play, was, a, success, in, paris, and, corneille, began, writing, plays, on, a, regular, basis, he, moved, to, paris, in, the, same, year, and, soon, became, one, of, the, leading, playwrights, of, the, french, stage, his, early, comedies, starting, with, m, lite, depart, from, the, french, farce, tradition, by, reflecting, the, elevated, language, and, manners, of, fashionable, parisian, society, corneille, describes, his, variety, of, comedy, as, une, peinture, de, la, conversation, des, honn, tes, gens, a, painting, of, the, conversation, of, the, gentry, his, first, true, tragedy, is, m, d, e, produced, in, 1635, the, year, 1634, brought, more, attention, to, corneille, he, was, selected, to, write, verses, for, cardinal, richelieu, s, visit, to, rouen, the, cardinal, took, notice, of, corneille, and, selected, him, to, be, among, les, cinq, auteurs, the, five, poets, also, translated, as, the, society, of, the, five, authors, the, others, were, guillaume, colletet, boisrobert, jean, rotrou, and, claude, de, l, estoile, the, five, were, selected, to, realize, richelieu, s, vision, of, a, new, kind, of, drama, that, emphasized, virtue, richelieu, would, present, ideas, which, the, writers, would, express, in, dramatic, form, however, the, cardinal, s, demands, were, too, restrictive, for, corneille, who, attempted, to, innovate, outside, the, boundaries, defined, by, richelieu, this, led, to, contention, between, playwright, and, employer, after, his, initial, contract, ended, corneille, left, les, cinq, auteurs, and, returned, to, rouen, in, the, years, directly, following, this, break, with, richelieu, corneille, produced, what, is, considered, his, finest, play, le, cid, is, based, on, the, play, mocedades, del, cid, 1621, by, guillem, de, castro, both, plays, were, based, on, the, legend, of, rodrigo, d, az, de, vivar, nicknamed, el, cid, campeador, a, military, figure, in, medieval, spain, the, original, 1637, edition, of, the, play, was, subtitled, a, tragicomedy, acknowledging, that, it, intentionally, defies, the, classical, tragedy, comedy, distinction, even, though, le, cid, was, an, enormous, popular, success, it, was, the, subject, of, a, heated, argument, over, the, norms, of, dramatic, practice, known, as, the, querelle, du, cid, or, the, quarrel, of, le, cid, cardinal, richelieu, s, acad, mie, fran, aise, acknowledged, the, play, s, success, but, determined, that, it, was, defective, in, part, because, it, did, not, respect, the, classical, unities, of, time, place, and, action, unity, of, time, stipulated, that, all, the, action, in, a, play, must, take, place, within, a, 24, hour, time, frame, unity, of, place, that, there, must, be, only, one, setting, for, the, action, and, unity, of, action, that, the, plot, must, be, centred, on, a, single, conflict, or, problem, the, newly, formed, acad, mie, was, a, body, that, asserted, state, control, over, cultural, activity, although, it, usually, dealt, with, efforts, to, standardize, the, french, language, richelieu, himself, ordered, an, analysis, of, le, cid, accusations, of, immorality, were, leveled, at, the, play, in, the, form, of, a, famous, pamphlet, campaign, these, attacks, were, founded, on, the, classical, theory, that, the, theatre, was, a, site, of, moral, instruction, the, acad, mie, s, recommendations, concerning, the, play, are, articulated, in, jean, chapelain, s, sentiments, de, l, acad, mie, fran, aise, sur, la, tragi, com, die, du, cid, 1638, even, the, prominent, writer, georges, de, scud, ry, harshly, criticized, the, play, in, his, observations, sur, le, cid, 1637, the, intensity, of, this, war, of, pamphlets, was, heightened, severely, by, corneille, s, boastful, poem, excuse, ariste, in, which, he, rambled, and, boasted, about, his, talents, and, claimed, that, no, other, author, could, be, a, rival, these, poems, and, pamphlets, were, made, public, one, after, the, other, as, once, esteemed, playwrights, traded, slanderous, blows, at, one, point, corneille, took, several, shots, at, criticizing, author, jean, mairet, s, family, and, lineage, scud, ry, a, close, friend, of, mairet, at, the, time, did, not, stoop, to, corneille, s, level, of, distastefulness, but, instead, continued, to, pillory, le, cid, and, its, violations, scud, ry, even, stated, of, le, cid, that, almost, all, of, the, beauty, which, the, play, contains, is, plagiarized, this, war, of, pamphlets, eventually, influenced, richelieu, to, call, upon, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, to, analyze, the, play, in, their, final, conclusions, the, academy, ruled, that, even, though, corneille, had, attempted, to, remain, loyal, to, the, unity, of, time, le, cid, broke, too, many, of, the, unities, to, be, a, valued, piece, of, work, the, controversy, coupled, with, the, academy, s, ruling, proved, too, much, for, corneille, who, decided, to, return, to, rouen, when, one, of, his, plays, was, reviewed, unfavorably, corneille, was, known, to, withdraw, from, public, life, he, remained, publicly, silent, for, some, time, privately, however, he, was, said, to, be, troubled, and, obsessed, by, the, issues, making, numerous, revisions, to, the, play, after, a, hiatus, from, the, theater, corneille, returned, in, 1640, the, querelle, du, cid, caused, corneille, to, pay, closer, attention, to, classical, dramatic, rules, this, was, evident, in, his, next, plays, which, were, classical, tragedies, horace, 1640, dedicated, to, richelieu, cinna, 1643, and, polyeucte, 1643, these, three, plays, and, le, cid, are, collectively, known, as, corneille, s, classical, tetralogy, corneille, also, responded, to, the, criticisms, of, the, acad, mie, by, making, multiple, revisions, to, le, cid, to, make, it, closer, to, the, conventions, of, classical, tragedy, the, 1648, 1660, and, 1682, editions, were, no, longer, subtitled, tragicomedy, but, tragedy, corneille, s, popularity, grew, and, by, the, mid, 1640s, the, first, collection, of, his, plays, was, published, corneille, married, marie, de, lamp, ri, re, in, 1641, they, had, seven, children, together, in, the, mid, to, late, 1640s, corneille, produced, mostly, tragedies, la, mort, de, pomp, e, the, death, of, pompey, performed, 1644, rodogune, performed, 1645, th, odore, performed, 1646, and, h, raclius, performed, 1647, he, also, wrote, one, comedy, in, this, period, le, menteur, the, liar, 1644, in, 1652, the, play, pertharite, met, with, poor, critical, reviews, and, a, disheartened, corneille, decided, to, quit, the, theatre, he, began, to, focus, on, an, influential, verse, translation, of, the, imitation, of, christ, by, thomas, kempis, which, he, completed, in, 1656, after, an, absence, of, nearly, eight, years, corneille, was, persuaded, to, return, to, the, stage, in, 1659, he, wrote, the, play, oedipe, which, was, favored, by, louis, xiv, in, the, next, year, corneille, published, trois, discours, sur, le, po, me, dramatique, three, discourses, on, dramatic, poetry, which, were, in, part, defenses, of, his, style, these, writings, can, be, seen, as, corneille, s, response, to, the, querelle, du, cid, he, simultaneously, maintained, the, importance, of, classical, dramatic, rules, and, justified, his, own, transgressions, of, those, rules, in, le, cid, corneille, argued, the, aristotelian, dramatic, guidelines, were, not, meant, to, be, subject, to, a, strict, literal, reading, instead, he, suggested, that, they, were, open, to, interpretation, although, the, relevance, of, classical, rules, was, maintained, corneille, suggested, that, the, rules, should, not, be, so, tyrannical, that, they, stifle, innovation, even, though, corneille, was, prolific, after, his, return, to, the, stage, writing, one, play, a, year, for, the, 14, years, after, 1659, his, later, plays, did, not, have, the, same, success, as, those, of, his, earlier, career, other, writers, were, beginning, to, gain, popularity, in, 1670, corneille, and, jean, racine, one, of, his, dramatic, rivals, were, challenged, to, write, plays, on, the, same, incident, each, playwright, was, unaware, that, the, challenge, had, also, been, issued, to, the, other, when, both, plays, were, completed, it, was, generally, acknowledged, that, corneille, s, tite, et, b, r, nice, 1671, was, inferior, to, racine, s, play, b, r, nice, moli, re, was, also, prominent, at, the, time, and, corneille, even, composed, the, comedy, psych, 1671, in, collaboration, with, him, and, philippe, quinault, most, of, the, plays, that, corneille, wrote, after, his, return, to, the, stage, were, tragedies, they, included, la, toison, d, or, the, golden, fleece, 1660, sertorius, 1662, othon, 1664, ag, silas, 1666, and, attila, 1667, he, wrote, his, last, piece, sur, na, in, 1674, it, was, a, complete, failure, after, this, he, retired, from, the, stage, for, the, final, time, and, died, at, his, home, in, paris, in, 1684, his, grave, in, the, glise, saint, roch, went, without, a, monument, until, 1821, the, dramatist, author, and, philosopher, voltaire, created, with, the, support, of, the, acad, mie, fran, aise, a, twelve, volume, annotated, set, of, corneille, s, dramatic, works, the, commentaires, sur, corneille, it, was, voltaire, s, largest, ever, work, of, literary, criticism, voltaire, s, proposal, to, the, acad, mie, described, corneille, as, doing, for, the, french, language, what, homer, had, done, for, greek, showing, the, world, that, it, could, be, a, medium, for, great, art, voltaire, was, driven, to, defend, classic, french, literature, in, the, face, of, increasingly, popular, foreign, influences, such, as, william, shakespeare, this, is, reflected, in, the, first, edition, of, the, commentaires, published, in, 1764, which, focused, on, corneille, s, better, works, and, had, relatively, muted, criticisms, by, the, second, edition, published, ten, years, later, voltaire, had, come, to, a, more, negative, assessment, of, corneille, and, a, stronger, view, on, the, need, for, objective, criticism, he, added, five, hundred, critical, notes, covering, more, works, and, taking, a, more, negative, tone, critics, opinions, of, corneille, were, already, highly, polarised, voltaire, s, intervention, polarised, the, debate, further, and, some, critics, saw, his, criticisms, as, pedantic, and, driven, by, envy, in, the, 19th, century, the, tide, of, opinion, turned, against, voltaire, napoleon, expressed, a, preference, for, corneille, over, voltaire, reviving, the, former, s, reputation, as, a, dramatist, while, diminishing, the, latter, s, in, episode, 31, of, the, 1989, video, lecture, series, the, western, tradition, ucla, professor, eugen, weber, offers, further, commentary, on, mssr, corneille, s, work, but, remember, that, corneille, s, plays, were, directed, to, an, aristocracy, that, couldn, t, be, touched, by, sermons, by, moralizing, by, sentimentalism, so, he, touched, them, by, showing, the, greatness, of, self, discipline, and, self, denial, of, not, doing, what, you, want, but, what, you, should, do, and, note, that, corneille, didn, t, say, as, a, christian, would, that, doing, your, duty, makes, you, good, he, said, that, doing, your, duty, makes, you, great, when, corneille, presented, the, struggle, between, passion, and, duty, it, wasn, t, a, new, invention, what, was, new, in, corneille, was, that, he, showed, one, legitimate, passion, opposed, to, another, passion, that, was, equally, legitimate, it, was, important, to, elevate, the, debate, from, a, contest, between, right, and, wrong, to, a, contest, between, two, rights, because, a, gentleman, who, got, into, a, fight, could, not, admit, that, he, was, wrong, but, if, you, started, by, stipulating, that, his, motives, were, honorable, he, would, at, least, stop, to, consider, your, argument, which, is, what, corneille, achieved, by, raising, the, debate, to, a, higher, plane, and, the, seventeenth, century, people, who, loved, his, adventure, stories, felt, vaguely, that, they, were, getting, in, them, something, they, hadn, t, quite, known, before, and, they, were, right, they, hadn, t, known, it, before, for, the, simple, reason, that, it, had, gone, out, with, the, greeks, roman, thought, was, too, legalistic, christian, thought, was, too, simplistic, to, tolerate, the, idea, that, there, could, be, two, rights, that, there, could, be, two, sides, to, a, conflict, this, is, a, very, sophisticated, view, and, it, is, only, fit, for, very, sophisticated, minds, and, the, tiny, minority, of, the, seventeenth, century, society, that, read, corneille, that, saw, corneille, s, plays, was, hardly, very, sophisticated, but, it, was, beginning, to, try, at, least
