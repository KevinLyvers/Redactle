away, from, the, balkans, and, toward, the, middle, east, by, the, eighteenth, century, selim, s, conquest, of, the, mamluk, sultanate, had, come, to, be, romanticized, as, the, moment, when, the, ottomans, seized, leadership, over, the, rest, of, the, muslim, world, and, consequently, selim, is, popularly, remembered, as, the, first, legitimate, ottoman, caliph, although, stories, of, an,

by, his, father, to, trabzon, to, serve, there, as, governor, during, his, reign, as, governor, of, trabzon, selim, had, earned, a, great, reputation, among, his, military, men, for, his, confrontations, with, the, safavids, slave, raids, and, a, campaign, in, the, caucasus, against, georgia, in, 1505, selim, routed, a, 3, 000, strong, safavid, army, led, by, shah, ismail, s, brother,

this, fratricidal, policy, was, motivated, by, bouts, of, civil, strife, that, had, been, sparked, by, the, antagonism, between, selim, s, father, and, his, uncle, cem, sultan, and, between, selim, himself, and, his, brother, ahmet, after, many, centuries, of, calm, the, alevi, population, was, active, while, selim, i, was, the, sultan, and, they, seem, to, have, been, backed, by, the, qizilbash, of, iran, one, of, selim, s, first, challenges, as, sultan, involved, the, growing, tension, between, the, ottoman, empire, and, the, safavid, empire, led, by, shah, ismail, who, had, recently, brought, the, safavids, to, power, and, had, switched, the, persian, state, religion, from, sunni, islam, to, adherence, to, the, twelver, branch, of, shia, islam, by, 1510, ismail, had, conquered, the, whole, of, iran, and, azerbaijan, southern, dagestan, with, its, important, city, of, derbent, mesopotamia, armenia, khorasan, eastern, anatolia, and, had, made, the, georgian, kingdoms, of, kartli, and, kakheti, his, vassals, he, was, a, great, threat, to, his, sunni, muslim, neighbors, to, the, west, in, 1511, ismail, had, supported, a, pro, shia, safavid, uprising, in, anatolia, the, ahkulu, rebellion, early, in, his, reign, selim, created, a, list, of, all, shiites, ages, 7, to, 70, in, a, number, of, central, anatolian, cities, including, tokat, sivas, and, amasya, as, selim, marched, through, these, cities, his, forces, rounded, up, and, executed, all, the, shiites, they, could, find, most, of, them, were, beheaded, the, massacre, was, the, largest, in, ottoman, history, until, the, end, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1514, selim, i, attacked, ismail, s, kingdom, to, stop, the, spread, of, shiism, into, ottoman, dominions, selim, and, ism, il, had, exchanged, a, series, of, belligerent, letters, prior, to, the, attack, on, his, march, to, face, ism, il, selim, had, 50, 000, alevis, massacred, seeing, them, as, enemies, of, the, ottoman, empire, selim, i, defeated, ism, il, at, the, battle, of, chaldiran, in, 1514, ism, il, s, army, was, more, mobile, and, his, soldiers, better, prepared, but, the, ottomans, prevailed, due, in, large, part, to, their, efficient, modern, army, possession, of, artillery, black, powder, and, muskets, ism, il, was, wounded, and, almost, captured, in, battle, and, selim, i, entered, the, iranian, capital, of, tabriz, in, triumph, on, 5, september, but, did, not, linger, the, battle, of, chaldiran, was, of, historical, significance, the, reluctance, of, shah, ismail, to, accept, the, advantages, of, modern, firearms, and, the, importance, of, artillery, proved, decisive, after, the, battle, selim, referring, to, ismail, stated, that, his, adversary, was, always, drunk, to, the, point, of, losing, his, mind, and, totally, neglectful, of, the, affairs, of, the, state, sultan, selim, then, conquered, the, mamluk, sultanate, of, egypt, defeating, the, mamluk, egyptians, first, at, the, battle, of, marj, dabiq, 24, august, 1516, and, then, at, the, battle, of, ridanieh, 22, january, 1517, this, led, to, the, ottoman, annexation, of, the, entire, sultanate, from, syria, and, palestine, in, sham, to, hejaz, and, tihamah, in, the, arabian, peninsula, and, ultimately, egypt, itself, this, permitted, selim, to, extend, ottoman, power, to, the, muslim, holy, cities, of, mecca, and, medina, hitherto, under, egyptian, rule, rather, than, style, himself, the, kim, l, aremeyn, or, the, ruler, of, the, two, holy, cities, he, accepted, the, more, pious, title, dim, l, aremeyn, or, the, servant, of, the, two, holy, cities, the, last, abbasid, caliph, al, mutawakkil, iii, was, residing, in, cairo, as, a, mamluk, puppet, at, the, time, of, the, ottoman, conquest, he, was, subsequently, sent, into, exile, in, istanbul, in, the, eighteenth, century, a, story, emerged, claiming, that, he, had, officially, transferred, his, title, to, the, caliphate, to, selim, at, the, time, of, the, conquest, in, fact, selim, did, not, make, any, claim, to, exercise, the, sacred, authority, of, the, office, of, caliph, and, the, notion, of, an, official, transfer, was, a, later, invention, after, conquering, damascus, in, 1516, selim, ordered, the, restoration, of, the, tomb, of, ibn, arabi, d, 1240, a, famous, sufi, master, who, was, highly, revered, among, ottoman, sufis, a, planned, campaign, westward, was, cut, short, when, selim, was, overwhelmed, by, sickness, and, subsequently, died, in, the, ninth, year, of, his, reign, aged, 49, officially, it, is, said, that, selim, succumbed, to, a, mistreated, carbuncle, some, historians, however, suggest, that, he, died, of, cancer, or, that, his, physician, poisoned, him, other, historians, have, noted, that, selim, s, death, coincided, with, a, period, of, plague, in, the, empire, and, have, added, that, several, sources, imply, that, selim, himself, suffered, from, the, disease, on, 22, september, 1520, selim, i, s, eight, year, reign, came, to, an, end, selim, died, and, was, brought, to, istanbul, so, he, could, be, buried, in, yavuz, selim, mosque, which, sultan, suleiman, i, commissioned, in, loving, memory, of, his, father, selim, i, had, conquered, and, unified, the, islamic, holy, lands, protecting, the, lands, in, europe, he, gave, priority, to, the, east, as, he, believed, the, real, danger, came, from, there, by, most, accounts, selim, had, a, fiery, temper, and, had, very, high, expectations, of, those, below, him, several, of, his, viziers, were, executed, for, various, reasons, a, famous, anecdote, relates, how, another, vizier, playfully, asked, the, sultan, for, some, preliminary, notice, of, his, doom, so, that, he, might, have, time, to, put, his, affairs, in, order, the, sultan, laughed, and, replied, that, indeed, he, had, been, thinking, of, having, the, vizier, killed, but, had, no, one, fit, to, take, his, place, otherwise, he, would, gladly, oblige, a, popular, ottoman, curse, was, may, you, be, a, vizier, of, selim, s, as, a, reference, to, the, number, of, viziers, he, had, executed, selim, was, one, of, the, empire, s, most, successful, and, respected, rulers, being, energetic, and, hardworking, during, his, short, eight, years, of, ruling, he, accomplished, momentous, success, despite, the, length, of, his, reign, many, historians, agree, that, selim, prepared, the, ottoman, empire, to, reach, its, zenith, under, the, reign, of, his, son, and, successor, suleiman, the, magnificent, selim, was, bilingual, in, turkish, and, persian, with, the, ottoman, literary, critic, latif, died, 1582, noting, that, he, was, very, fond, of, speaking, persian, he, was, also, a, distinguished, poet, who, wrote, both, turkish, and, persian, verse, under, the, nickname, mahlas, selimi, collections, of, his, persian, poetry, are, extant, today, in, a, letter, to, his, rival, while, equating, himself, with, alexander, selim, compares, his, rival, ismail, as, darius, of, our, days, paolo, giovio, in, a, work, written, for, charles, v, says, that, selim, holds, alexander, the, great, and, julius, caesar, in, the, highest, esteem, above, all, the, generals, of, old, while, marching, into, persia, in, 1514, selim, s, troops, suffered, from, the, scorched, earth, tactics, of, shah, ismail, the, sultan, hoped, to, lure, ismail, into, an, open, battle, before, his, troops, starved, to, death, and, began, writing, insulting, letters, to, the, shah, accusing, him, of, cowardice, they, who, by, perjuries, seize, scepters, ought, not, to, skulk, from, danger, but, their, breast, ought, like, the, shield, to, be, held, out, to, encounter, peril, they, ought, like, the, helm, to, affront, the, foeman, s, blow, ismail, responded, to, selim, s, third, message, quoted, above, by, having, an, envoy, deliver, a, letter, accompanied, by, a, box, of, opium, the, shah, s, letter, insultingly, implied, that, selim, s, prose, was, the, work, of, an, unqualified, writer, on, drugs, selim, was, enraged, by, the, shah, s, denigration, of, his, literary, talent, and, ordered, the, persian, envoy, to, be, torn, to, pieces, outside, of, their, military, conflicts, selim, i, and, shah, ismail, clashed, on, the, economic, front, as, well, opposed, to, shah, ismail, s, adherence, to, the, shia, sect, of, islam, contrasting, his, sunni, beliefs, selim, i, and, his, father, before, him, did, not, really, accept, his, basic, political, and, religious, legitimacy, beginning, the, portrayal, of, the, safavids, in, ottoman, chronicles, as, kuffar, after, the, battle, of, chaldiran, selim, i, s, minimal, tolerance, for, shah, ismail, disintegrated, and, he, began, a, short, era, of, closed, borders, with, the, safavid, empire, selim, i, wanted, to, use, the, ottoman, empire, s, central, location, to, completely, cut, the, ties, between, shah, ismail, s, safavid, empire, and, the, rest, of, the, world, even, though, the, raw, materials, for, important, ottoman, silk, production, at, that, time, came, from, persia, rather, than, developed, within, the, ottoman, empire, itself, he, imposed, a, strict, embargo, on, iranian, silk, in, an, attempt, to, collapse, their, economy, for, a, short, amount, of, time, the, silk, resources, were, imported, via, the, mamluk, territory, of, aleppo, but, by, 1517, selim, i, had, conquered, the, mamluk, state, and, the, trade, fully, came, to, a, standstill, so, strict, was, this, embargo, that, merchants, who, had, been, incautious, enough, not, to, immediately, leave, ottoman, territory, when, war, was, declared, had, their, goods, taken, away, and, were, imprisoned, and, to, emphasize, frontier, security, sancaks, along, the, border, between, the, two, empires, were, given, exclusively, to, sunnis, and, those, who, did, not, have, any, relationship, with, the, safavid, sympathizing, k, z, lba, iranian, merchants, were, barred, from, entering, the, borders, of, the, ottoman, empire, under, selim, i, shah, ismail, received, revenue, via, customs, duties, therefore, after, the, war, to, demonstrate, his, commitment, to, their, thorny, rivalry, selim, i, halted, trade, with, the, safavids, even, at, the, expense, of, his, empire, s, own, silk, industry, and, citizens, this, embargo, and, closed, borders, policy, was, reversed, quickly, by, his, son, suleyman, i, after, selim, i, s, death, in, 1520, babur, s, early, relations, with, the, ottomans, were, poor, because, selim, i, provided, babur, s, uzbek, rival, ubaydullah, khan, with, powerful, matchlocks, and, cannons, in, 1507, when, ordered, to, accept, selim, i, as, his, rightful, suzerain, babur, refused, and, gathered, qizilbash, servicemen, in, order, to, counter, the, forces, of, ubaydullah, khan, during, the, battle, of, ghazdewan, in, 1512, in, 1513, selim, i, reconciled, with, babur, fearing, that, he, would, join, the, safavids, dispatched, ustad, ali, quli, and, mustafa, rumi, and, many, other, ottoman, turks, in, order, to, assist, babur, in, his, conquests, this, particular, assistance, proved, to, be, the, basis, of, future, mughal, ottoman, relations, from, them, he, also, adopted, the, tactic, of, using, matchlocks, and, cannons, in, field, rather, than, only, in, sieges, which, would, give, him, an, important, advantage, in, india, selim, i, had, two, known, consorts, selim, i, had, at, least, six, sons, selim, i, had, at, least, nine, daughters
