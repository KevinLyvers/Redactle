decide, that, the, editors, murdoch, described, howard, s, successor, labor, party, prime, minister, kevin, rudd, as, more, ambitious, to, lead, the, world, than, to, lead, australia, and, criticised, rudd, s, expansionary, fiscal, policies, in, the, wake, of, the, financial, crisis, of, 2007, 2008, as, unnecessary, in, 2009, in, response, to, accusations, by, rudd, that, news, limited, was,

the, courier, mail, and, the, adelaide, advertiser, it, was, suggested, by, the, commentator, mungo, maccallum, in, the, monthly, that, the, anti, rudd, push, if, coordinated, at, all, was, almost, certainly, locally, driven, as, opposed, to, being, directed, by, murdoch, who, also, took, a, different, position, from, local, editors, on, such, matters, as, climate, change, and, stimulus, packages, to, combat, the, financial, crisis, murdoch, is, a, supporter, of, an, australian, republic, having, campaigned, for, such, a, change, during, the, 1999, referendum, in, 1968, murdoch,

struggling, times, and, sunday, times, from, canadian, newspaper, publisher, lord, thomson, of, fleet, ownership, of, the, times, came, to, him, through, his, relationship, with, lord, thomson, who, had, grown, tired, of, losing, money, on, it, as, a, result, of, an, extended, period, of, industrial, action, that, stopped, publication, in, the, light, of, success, and, expansion, at, the, sun, the, owners, believed, that, murdoch, could, turn, the, papers, around, harold, evans, editor, of, the, sunday, times, from, 1967, was, switched, to, the, daily, times, though, he, stayed, only, a, year, amid, editorial, conflict, with, murdoch, during, the, 1980s, and, early, 1990s, murdoch, s, publications, were, generally, supportive, of, britain, s, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, at, the, end, of, the, thatcher, major, era, murdoch, switched, his, support, to, the, labour, party, and, its, leader, tony, blair, the, closeness, of, his, relationship, with, blair, and, their, secret, meetings, to, discuss, national, policies, was, to, become, a, political, issue, in, britain, this, later, changed, with, the, sun, in, its, english, editions, publicly, renouncing, the, ruling, labour, government, and, lending, its, support, to, david, cameron, s, conservative, party, which, soon, afterwards, formed, a, coalition, government, in, scotland, where, the, conservatives, had, suffered, a, complete, annihilation, in, 1997, the, paper, began, to, endorse, the, scottish, national, party, though, not, yet, its, flagship, policy, of, independence, which, soon, after, came, to, form, the, first, ever, outright, majority, in, the, proportionally, elected, scottish, parliament, former, prime, minister, gordon, brown, s, official, spokesman, said, in, november, 2009, that, brown, and, murdoch, were, in, regular, communication, and, that, there, is, nothing, unusual, in, the, prime, minister, talking, to, rupert, murdoch, in, 1986, murdoch, introduced, electronic, production, processes, to, his, newspapers, in, australia, britain, and, the, united, states, the, greater, degree, of, automation, led, to, significant, reductions, in, the, number, of, employees, involved, in, the, printing, process, in, england, the, move, roused, the, anger, of, the, print, unions, resulting, in, a, long, and, often, violent, dispute, that, played, out, in, wapping, one, of, london, s, docklands, areas, where, murdoch, had, installed, the, very, latest, electronic, newspaper, purpose, built, publishing, facility, in, an, old, warehouse, the, bitter, wapping, dispute, started, with, the, dismissal, of, 6, 000, employees, who, had, gone, on, strike, and, resulted, in, street, battles, and, demonstrations, many, on, the, political, left, in, britain, alleged, the, collusion, of, margaret, thatcher, s, conservative, government, with, murdoch, in, the, wapping, affair, as, a, way, of, damaging, the, british, trade, union, movement, in, 1987, the, dismissed,

it, was, the, largest, amount, ever, offered, for, a, sports, club, it, was, blocked, by, the, united, kingdom, s, competition, commission, which, stated, that, the, acquisition, would, have, hurt, competition, in, the, broadcast, industry, and, the, quality, of, british, football, murdoch, s, british, based, satellite, network, sky, television, incurred, massive, losses, in, its, early, years, of, operation, as, with, many, of, his, other, business, interests, sky, was, heavily, subsidised, by, the, profits, generated, by, his, other, holdings, but, convinced, rival, satellite, operator, british, satellite, broadcasting, to, accept, a, merger, on, his, terms, in, 1990, the, merged, company, bskyb, has, dominated, the, british, pay, tv, market, ever, since, pursuing, direct, to, home,

israel, and, the, occupied, golan, heights, in, response, to, print, media, s, decline, and, the, increasing, influence, of, online, journalism, during, the, 2000s, murdoch, proclaimed, his, support, of, the, micropayments, model, for, obtaining, revenue, from, online, news, although, this, has, been, criticised, by, some, in, january, 2018, the, cma, blocked, murdoch, from, taking, over, the, remaining, 61, of, bskyb, he, did, not, already, own, over, fear, of, market, dominance, that, could, potentialise, censorship, of, the, media, his, bid, for, bskyb, was, later, approved, by, the, cma, as, long, as, he, sold, sky, news, to, the, walt, disney, company, which, was, already, set, to, acquire, 21st, century, fox, however, it, was, comcast, who, won, control, of, bskyb, in, a, blind, auction, ordered, by, the, cma, murdoch, ultimately, sold, his, 39, of, bskyb, to, comcast, news, corporation, has, subsidiaries, in, the, bahamas, the, cayman, islands, the, channel, islands, and, the, virgin, islands, from, 1986, news, corporation, s, annual, tax, bill, averaged, around, seven, percent, of, its, profits, in, britain, in, the, 1980s, murdoch, formed, a, close, alliance, with, conservative, prime, minister, margaret, thatcher, in, february, 1981, when, murdoch, already, owner, of, the, sun, and, the, news, of, the, world, sought, to, buy, the, times, and, the, sunday, times, thatcher, s, government, let, his, bid, pass, without, referring, it, to, the, monopolies, and, mergers, commission, which, was, usual, practice, at, the, time, although, contact, between, the, two, before, this, point, had, been, explicitly, denied, in, an, official, history, of, the, times, documents, found, in, thatcher, s, archives, in, 2012, revealed, a, secret, meeting, had, taken, place, a, month, before, in, which, murdoch, briefed, thatcher, on, his, plans, for, the, paper, such, as, taking, on, trade, unions, the, sun, credited, itself, with, helping, her, successor, john, major, to, win, an, unexpected, election, victory, in, the, 1992, general, election, which, had, been, expected, to, end, in, a, hung, parliament, or, a, narrow, win, for, labour, then, led, by, neil, kinnock, in, the, general, elections, of, 1997, 2001, and, 2005, murdoch, s, papers, were, either, neutral, or, supported, labour, under, tony, blair, the, labour, party, from, when, blair, became, leader, in, 1994, had, moved, from, the, centre, left, to, a, more, centrist, position, on, many, economic, issues, before, 1997, murdoch, identifies, himself, as, a, libertarian, saying, what, does, libertarian, mean, as, much, individual, responsibility, as, possible, as, little, government, as, possible, as, few, rules, as, possible, but, i, m, not, saying, it, should, be, taken, to, the, absolute, limit, in, a, speech, he, delivered, in, new, york, in, 2005, murdoch, claimed, that, blair, described, the, bbc, coverage, of, the, hurricane, katrina, disaster, which, was, critical, of, the, bush, administration, s, response, as, full, of, hatred, of, america, on, 28, june, 2006, the, bbc, reported, that, murdoch, and, news, corporation, were, considering, backing, new, conservative, leader, david, cameron, at, the, next, general, election, still, up, to, four, years, away, in, a, later, interview, in, july, 2006, when, he, was, asked, what, he, thought, of, the, conservative, leader, murdoch, replied, not, much, in, a, 2009, blog, it, was, suggested, that, in, the, aftermath, of, the, news, of, the, world, phone, hacking, scandal, which, might, yet, have, transatlantic, implications, murdoch, and, news, corporation, might, have, decided, to, back, cameron, despite, this, there, had, already, been, a, convergence, of, interests, between, the, two, men, over, the,

cameron, had, served, as, prime, minister, up, to, that, point, it, was, also, reported, that, murdoch, had, given, cameron, a, personal, guarantee, that, there, would, be, no, risk, attached, to, hiring, andy, coulson, the, former, editor, of, news, of, the, world, as, the, conservative, party, s, communication, director, in, 2007, this, was, in, spite, of, coulson, having, resigned, as, editor, over, phone, hacking, by, a, reporter, cameron, chose, to, take, murdoch, s, advice, despite, warnings, from, deputy, prime, minister, nick, clegg, lord, ashdown, and, the, guardian, coulson,

international, fell, sharply, in, the, united, kingdom, during, the, early, 21st, century, leading, some, commentators, to, suggest, that, rupert, murdoch, was, not, as, influential, in, british,
