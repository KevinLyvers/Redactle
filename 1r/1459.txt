became, an, eminent, historian, and, diplomat, while, remaining, close, to, bismarck, wrote, a, novel, in, 1839, morton, s, hope, or, the, memoirs, of, a, provincial, about, life, in, a, german, university, in, it, he, described, bismarck, as, a, reckless, and, dashing, eccentric, but, also, as, an, extremely, gifted, and, charming, young, man, although, bismarck, hoped, to, become, a, diplomat, he, started, his, practical, training, as, a, lawyer, in, aachen, and, potsdam, and, soon, resigned, having, first, placed, his, career, in, jeopardy, by, taking, unauthorized, leave, to, pursue, two, english, girls, first, laura, russell, niece, of, the, duke, of, cleveland, and, then, isabella, loraine, smith, daughter, of, a, wealthy, clergyman, in, 1838, bismarck, began, a,

herbert, b, 1849, and, wilhelm, b, 1852, johanna, was, a, shy, retiring, and, deeply, religious, woman, although, famed, for, her, sharp, tongue, in, later, life, in, 1847, bismarck, aged, thirty, two, was, chosen, as, a, representative, to, the, newly, created, prussian, legislature, the, vereinigter, landtag, there, he, gained, a, reputation, as, a, royalist, and, reactionary, politician, with, a, gift, for, stinging, rhetoric, he, openly, advocated, the, idea, that, the, monarch, had, a, divine, right, to, rule, his, selection, was, arranged, by, the, gerlach, brothers, fellow, pietist, lutherans, whose, ultra, conservative, faction, was, known, as, the, kreuzzeitung, after, their, newspaper, the, neue, preu, ische, zeitung, which, was, so, nicknamed, because, it, featured, an, iron, cross, on, its, cover, in, march, 1848, prussia, faced, a, revolution, one, of, the, revolutions, of, 1848, across, europe, which, completely, overwhelmed, king, frederick, william, iv, the, monarch, though, initially, inclined, to, use, armed, forces, to, suppress, the, rebellion, ultimately, declined, to, leave, berlin, for, the, safety, of, military, headquarters, at, potsdam, bismarck, later, recorded, that, there, had, been, a, rattling, of, sabres, in, their, scabbards, from, prussian, officers, when, they, learned, that, the, king, would, not, suppress, the, revolution, by, force, he, offered, numerous, concessions, to, the, liberals, he, wore, the, black, red, gold, revolutionary, colours, as, seen, on, the, flag, of, today, s, germany, promised, to, promulgate, a, constitution, agreed, that, prussia, and, other, german, states, should, merge, into, a, single, nation, state, and, appointed, a, liberal, gottfried, ludolf, camphausen, as, minister, president, bismarck, had, at, first, tried, to, rouse, the, peasants, of, his, estate, into, an, army, to, march, on, berlin, in, the, king, s, name, he, travelled, to, berlin, in, disguise, to, offer, his, services, but, was, instead, told, to, make, himself, useful, by, arranging, food, supplies, for, the, army, from, his, estates, in, case, they, were, needed, the, king, s, brother, prince, wilhelm, had, fled, to, england, bismarck, tried, to, get, wilhelm, s, wife, augusta, to, place, their, teenage, son, frederick, william, on, the, prussian, throne, in, frederick, william, iv, s, place, augusta, would, have, none, of, it, and, detested, bismarck, thereafter, despite, the, fact, that, he, later, helped, restore, a, working, relationship, between, wilhelm, and, his, brother, the, king, bismarck, was, not, yet, a, member, of, the, house, of, representatives, the, lower, house, of, the, new, prussian, legislature, the, liberal, movement, perished, by, the, end, of, 1848, amid, internal, fighting, meanwhile, the, conservatives, regrouped, formed, an, inner, group, of, advisers, including, the, gerlach, brothers, known, as, the, camarilla, around, the, king, and, retook, control, of, berlin, although, a, constitution, was, granted, its, provisions, fell, far, short, of, the, demands, of, the, revolutionaries, in, 1849, bismarck, was, elected, to, the, landtag, at, this, stage, in, his, career, he, opposed, the, unification, of, germany, arguing, that, prussia, would, lose, its, independence, in, the, process, he, accepted, his, appointment, as, one, of, prussia, s, representatives, at, the, erfurt, parliament, an, assembly, of, german, states, that, met, to, discuss, plans, for, union, but, he, only, did, so, to, oppose, that, body, s, proposals, more, effectively, the, parliament, failed, to, bring, about, unification, for, it, lacked, the, support, of, the, two, most, important, german, states, prussia, and, austria, in, september, 1850, after, a, dispute, over, the, electorate, of, hesse, the, hesse, crisis, of, 1850, prussia, was, humiliated, and, forced, to, back, down, by, austria, supported, by, russia, in, the, so, called, punctation, of, olm, tz, a, plan, for, the, unification, of, germany, under, prussian, leadership, proposed, by, prussia, s, foreign, minister, joseph, von, radowitz, was, also, abandoned, in, 1851, frederick, william, iv, appointed, bismarck, as, prussia, s, envoy, to, the, diet, of, the, german, confederation, in, frankfurt, bismarck, gave, up, his, elected, seat, in, the, landtag, but, was, appointed, to, the, prussian, house, of, lords, a, few, years, later, in, frankfurt, he, engaged, in, a, battle, of, wills, with, the, austrian, representative, count, friedrich, von, thun, und, hohenstein, he, insisted, on, being, treated, as, an, equal, by, petty, tactics, such, as, imitating, thun, when, thun, claimed, the, privileges, of, smoking, and, removing, his, jacket, in, meetings, this, episode, was, the, background, for, an, altercation, in, the, frankfurt, chamber, with, georg, von, vincke, that, led, to, a, duel, between, bismarck, and, vincke, with, carl, von, bodelschwingh, as, an, impartial, party, which, ended, without, injury, bismarck, s, eight, years, in, frankfurt, were, marked, by, changes, in, his, political, opinions, detailed, in, the, numerous, lengthy, memoranda, which, he, sent, to, his, ministerial, superiors, in, berlin, no, longer, under, the, influence, of, his, ultraconservative, prussian, friends, bismarck, became, less, reactionary, and, more, pragmatic, he, became, convinced, that, to, countervail, austria, s, newly, restored, influence, prussia, would, have, to, ally, herself, with, other, german, states, as, a, result, he, grew, to, be, more, accepting, of, the, notion, of, a, united, german, nation, he, gradually, came, to, believe, that, he, and, his, fellow, conservatives, had, to, take, the, lead, in, creating, a, unified, nation, to, keep, from, being, eclipsed, he, also, believed, that, the, middle, class, liberals, wanted, a, unified, germany, more, than, they, wanted, to, break, the, grip, of, the, traditional, forces, over, society, bismarck, also, worked, to, maintain, the, friendship, of, russia, and, a, working, relationship, with, napoleon, iii, s, france, the, latter, being, anathema, to, his, conservative, friends, the, gerlachs, but, necessary, both, to, threaten, austria, and, to, prevent, france, allying, with, russia, in, a, famous, letter, to, leopold, von, gerlach, bismarck, wrote, that, it, was, foolish, to, play, chess, having, first, put, 16, of, the, 64, squares, out, of, bounds, this, observation, became, ironic, as, after, 1871, france, indeed, became, germany, s, permanent, enemy, and, eventually, allied, with, russia, against, germany, in, the, 1890s, bismarck, was, alarmed, by, prussia, s, isolation, during, the, crimean, war, of, the, mid, 1850s, in, which, austria, sided, with, britain, and, france, against, russia, prussia, was, almost, not, invited, to, the, peace, talks, in, paris, in, the, great, eastern, crisis, of, the, 1870s, fear, of, a, repetition, of, this, turn, of, events, would, later, be, a, factor, in, bismarck, s, signing, the, dual, alliance, with, austria, hungary, in, 1879, in, october, 1857, frederick, william, iv, suffered, a, paralysing, stroke, and, his, brother, wilhelm, took, over, the, prussian, government, as, regent, wilhelm, was, initially, seen, as, a, moderate, ruler, whose, friendship, with, liberal, britain, was, symbolised, by, the, recent, marriage, of, his, son, frederick, william, to, queen, victoria, s, eldest, daughter, as, part, of, his, new, era, wilhelm, brought, in, new, ministers, moderate, conservatives, known, as, the, wochenblatt, after, their, newspaper, the, regent, soon, replaced, bismarck, as, envoy, in, frankfurt, and, made, him, prussia, s, ambassador, to, the, russian, empire, in, theory, this, was, a, promotion, as, russia, was, one, of, prussia, s, two, most, powerful, neighbors, but, bismarck, was, sidelined, from, events, in, germany, and, could, only, watch, impotently, as, france, drove, austria, out, of, lombardy, during, the, italian, war, of, 1859, bismarck, proposed, that, prussia, should, exploit, austria, s, weakness, to, move, her, frontiers, as, far, south, as, lake, constance, on, the, swiss, border, instead, prussia, mobilised, troops, in, the, rhineland, to, deter, further, french, advances, into, venetia, bismarck, stayed, in, st, petersburg, for, four, years, during, which, he, almost, lost, his, leg, to, botched, medical, treatment, and, once, again, met, his, future, adversary, the, russian, prince, alexander, gorchakov, who, had, been, the, russian, representative, in, frankfurt, in, the, early, 1850s, the, regent, also, appointed, helmuth, von, moltke, as, the, new, chief, of, staff, of, the, prussian, army, and, albrecht, von, roon, as, minister, of, war, with, the, job, of, reorganizing, the, army, over, the, next, twelve, years, bismarck, moltke, and, roon, transformed, prussia, despite, his, lengthy, stay, abroad, bismarck, was, not, entirely, detached, from, german, domestic, affairs, he, remained, well, informed, due, to, roon, with, whom, bismarck, formed, a, lasting, friendship, and, political, alliance, in, may, 1862, he, was, sent, to, paris, to, serve, as, ambassador, to, france, and, also, visited, england, that, summer, these, visits, enabled, him, to, meet, and, take, the, measure, of, several, adversaries, napoleon, iii, in, france, and, in, britain, prime, minister, palmerston, foreign, secretary, earl, russell, and, conservative, politician, benjamin, disraeli, prince, wilhelm, became, king, of, prussia, upon, his, brother, frederick, wilhelm, iv, s, death, in, 1861, the, new, monarch, often, came, into, conflict, with, the, increasingly, liberal, prussian, landtag, a, crisis, arose, in, 1862, when, the, landtag, refused, to, authorize, funding, for, a, proposed, re, organization, of, the, army, the, king, s, ministers, could, not, convince, legislators, to, pass, the, budget, and, the, king, was, unwilling, to, make, concessions, wilhelm, threatened, to, abdicate, in, favour, of, his, son, crown, prince, frederick, william, who, opposed, his, doing, so, believing, that, bismarck, was, the, only, politician, capable, of, handling, the, crisis, however, wilhelm, was, ambivalent, about, appointing, a, person, who, demanded, unfettered, control, over, foreign, affairs, it, was, in, september, 1862, when, the, abgeordnetenhaus, house, of, representatives, overwhelmingly, rejected, the, proposed, budget, that, wilhelm, was, persuaded, to, recall, bismarck, to, prussia, on, the, advice, of, roon, on, 23, september, 1862, wilhelm, appointed, bismarck, minister, president, and, foreign, minister, bismarck, roon, and, moltke, took, charge, at, a, time, when, relations, among, the, great, powers, great, britain, france, austria, and, russia, had, been, shattered, by, the, crimean, war, and, the, first, italian, war, of, independence, in, the, midst, of, this, disarray, the, european, balance, of, power, was, restructured, with, the, creation, of, the, german, empire, as, the, dominant, power, in, continental, europe, apart, from, russia, this, was, achieved, by, bismarck, s, diplomacy, roon, s, reorganization, of, the, army, and, moltke, s, military, strategy, despite, the, initial, distrust, of, the, king, and, crown, prince, and, the, loathing, of, queen, augusta, bismarck, soon, acquired, a, powerful, hold, over, the, king, by, force, of, personality, and, powers, of, persuasion, bismarck, was, intent, on, maintaining, royal, supremacy, by, ending, the, budget, deadlock, in, the, king, s, favour, even, if, he, had, to, use, extra, legal, means, to, do, so, under, the, constitution, the, budget, could, be, passed, only, after, the, king, and, legislature, agreed, on, its, terms, bismarck, contended, that, since, the, constitution, did, not, provide, for, cases, in, which, legislators, failed, to, approve, a, budget, there, was, a, legal, loophole, in, the, constitution, and, so, he, could, apply, the, previous, year, s, budget, to, keep, the, government, running, thus, on, the, basis, of, the, 1861, budget, tax, collection, continued, for, four, years, bismarck, s, conflict, with, the, legislators, intensified, in, the, coming, years, following, the, alvensleben, convention, of, 1863, the, house, of, representatives, resolved, that, it, could, no, longer, come, to, terms, with, bismarck, in, response, the, king, dissolved, the, landtag, accusing, it, of, trying, to, obtain, unconstitutional, control, over, the, ministry, which, under, the, constitution, was, responsible, solely, to, the, king, bismarck, then, issued, an, edict, restricting, the, freedom, of, the, press, an, edict, that, even, gained, the, public, opposition, of, the, crown, prince, despite, or, perhaps, because, of, his, attempts, to, silence, critics, bismarck, remained, a, largely, unpopular, politician, his, supporters, fared, poorly, in, the, elections, of, october, 1863, in, which, a, liberal, coalition, whose, primary, member, was, the, progress, party, won, over, two, thirds, of, the, seats, the, house, made, repeated, calls, for, bismarck, to, be, dismissed, but, the, king, supported, him, fearing, that, if, he, did, dismiss, the, minister, president, he, would, most, likely, be, succeeded, by, a, liberal, german, unification, had, been, a, major, objective, of, the, revolutions, of, 1848, when, representatives, of, the, german, states, met, in, frankfurt, and, drafted, a, constitution, creating, a, federal, union, with, a, national, parliament, to, be, elected, by, universal, male, suffrage, in, april, 1849, the, frankfurt, parliament, offered, the, title, of, emperor, to, king, frederick, william, iv, fearing, the, opposition, of, the, other, german, princes, and, the, military, intervention, of, austria, and, russia, the, king, renounced, this, popular, mandate, citing, his, concerns, over, the, legitimacy, of, the, parliament, to, offer, him, the, crown, without, the, consent, of, the, various, german, rulers, thus, the, frankfurt, parliament, ended, in, failure, for, the, german, liberals, on, 30, september, 1862, bismarck, made, a, famous, speech, to, the, budget, committee, of, the, prussian, chamber, of, deputies, in, which, he, expounded, on, the, use, of, iron, and, blood, to, achieve, prussia, s, goals, prussia, must, concentrate, and, maintain, its, power, for, the, favorable, moment, which, has, already, slipped, by, several, times, prussia, s, boundaries, according, to, the, vienna, treaties, are, not, favorable, to, a, healthy, state, life, the, great, questions, of, the, time, will, not, be, resolved, by, speeches, and, majority, decisions, that, was, the, great, mistake, of, 1848, and, 1849, but, by, iron, and, blood, prior, to, the, 1860s, germany, consisted, of, a, multitude, of, principalities, loosely, bound, together, as, members, of, the, german, confederation, bismarck, used, both, diplomacy, and, the, prussian, military, to, achieve, unification, excluding, austria, from, a, unified, germany, this, made, prussia, the, most, powerful, and, dominant, component, of, the, new, germany, but, also, ensured, that, it, remained, an, authoritarian, state, and, not, a, liberal, parliamentary, democracy, bismarck, faced, a, diplomatic, crisis, when, king, frederick, vii, of, denmark, died, in, november, 1863, the, succession, to, the, duchies, of, schleswig, and, holstein, was, disputed, they, were, claimed, by, christian, ix, frederick, vii, s, heir, as, king, and, also, by, frederick, von, augustenburg, a, danish, duke, prussian, public, opinion, strongly, favoured, augustenburg, s, claim, as, the, populations, of, holstein, and, southern, schleswig, were, primarily, german, speaking, bismarck, took, an, unpopular, step, by, insisting, that, the, territories, legally, belonged, to, the, danish, monarch, under, the, london, protocol, signed, a, decade, earlier, nonetheless, bismarck, denounced, christian, s, decision, to, completely, annex, schleswig, to, denmark, with, support, from, austria, he, issued, an, ultimatum, for, christian, ix, to, return, schleswig, to, its, former, status, when, denmark, refused, austria, and, prussia, invaded, sparking, the, second, schleswig, war, denmark, was, ultimately, forced, to, renounce, its, claim, on, both, duchies, at, first, this, seemed, like, a, victory, for, augustenburg, but, bismarck, soon, removed, him, from, power, by, making, a, series, of, unworkable, demands, namely, that, prussia, should, have, control, over, the, army, and, navy, of, the, duchies, originally, it, had, been, proposed, that, the, diet, of, the, german, confederation, in, which, all, the, states, of, germany, were, represented, should, determine, the, fate, of, the, duchies, but, before, this, scheme, could, be, effected, bismarck, induced, austria, to, agree, to, the, gastein, convention, under, this, agreement, signed, on, 20, august, 1865, prussia, received, schleswig, while, austria, received, holstein, in, that, year, bismarck, was, given, the, title, of, count, graf, of, bismarck, sch, nhausen, in, 1866, austria, reneged, on, the, agreement, and, demanded, that, the, diet, determine, the, schleswig, holstein, issue, bismarck, used, this, as, an, excuse, to, start, a, war, with, austria, by, accusing, them, of, violating, the, gastein, convention, bismarck, sent, prussian, troops, to, occupy, holstein, provoked, austria, called, for, the, aid, of, other, german, states, who, quickly, became, involved, in, the, austro, prussian, war, thanks, to, roon, s, reorganization, the, prussian, army, was, nearly, equal, in, numbers, to, the, austrian, army, with, the, strategic, genius, of, moltke, the, prussian, army, fought, battles, it, was, able, to, win, bismarck, had, also, made, a, secret, alliance, with, italy, who, desired, austrian, controlled, veneto, italy, s, entry, into, the, war, forced, the, austrians, to, divide, their, forces, meanwhile, as, the, war, began, a, german, radical, named, ferdinand, cohen, blind, attempted, to, assassinate, bismarck, in, berlin, shooting, him, five, times, at, close, range, bismarck, had, only, minor, injuries, cohen, blind, later, committed, suicide, while, in, custody, the, war, lasted, seven, weeks, austria, had, a, seemingly, powerful, army, that, was, allied, with, most, of, the, north, german, and, all, of, the, south, german, states, nevertheless, prussia, won, the, decisive, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, the, king, and, his, generals, wanted, to, push, onward, conquer, bohemia, and, march, to, vienna, but, bismarck, worried, that, prussian, military, luck, might, change, or, that, france, might, intervene, on, austria, s, side, enlisted, the, help, of, crown, prince, frederick, wilhelm, who, had, opposed, the, war, but, had, commanded, one, of, the, prussian, armies, at, k, niggr, tz, to, dissuade, his, father, after, stormy, arguments, bismarck, insisted, on, a, soft, peace, with, no, annexations, and, no, victory, parades, so, as, to, be, able, to, quickly, restore, friendly, relations, with, austria, prussia, had, only, a, plurality, 17, out, of, 43, seats, in, the, bundesrat, despite, being, larger, than, the, other, 21, states, combined, but, bismarck, could, easily, control, the, proceedings, through, alliances, with, the, smaller, states, this, began, what, historians, refer, to, as, the, misery, of, austria, in, which, austria, served, as, a, mere, vassal, to, the, superior, germany, a, relationship, that, was, to, shape, history, until, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, jonathan, steinberg, says, of, bismarck, s, achievements, to, this, point, the, scale, of, bismarck, s, triumph, cannot, be, exaggerated, he, alone, had, brought, about, a, complete, transformation, of, the, european, international, order, he, had, told, those, who, would, listen, what, he, intended, to, do, how, he, intended, to, do, it, and, he, did, it, he, achieved, this, incredible, feat, without, commanding, an, army, and, without, the, ability, to, give, an, order, to, the, humblest, common, soldier, without, control, of, a, large, party, without, public, support, indeed, in, the, face, of, almost, universal, hostility, without, a, majority, in, parliament, without, control, of, his, cabinet, and, without, a, loyal, following, in, the, bureaucracy, he, no, longer, had, the, support, of, the, powerful, conservative, interest, groups, who, had, helped, him, achieve, power, the, most, senior, diplomats, in, the, foreign, service, were, sworn, enemies, and, he, knew, it, the, queen, and, the, royal, family, hated, him, and, the, king, emotional, and, unreliable, would, soon, have, his, 70th, birthday, with, perfect, justice, in, august, 1866, he, punched, his, fist, on, his, desk, and, cried, i, have, beaten, them, all, all, prussia, s, victory, over, austria, increased, the, already, existing, tensions, with, france, the, emperor, of, france, napoleon, iii, had, tried, to, gain, territory, for, france, in, belgium, and, on, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, as, a, compensation, for, not, joining, the, war, against, prussia, and, was, disappointed, by, the, surprisingly, quick, outcome, of, the, war, accordingly, opposition, politician, adolphe, thiers, claimed, that, it, was, france, not, austria, who, had, really, been, defeated, at, k, niggr, tz, bismarck, at, the, same, time, did, not, avoid, war, with, france, though, he, feared, the, french, for, a, number, of, reasons, first, he, feared, that, austria, hungry, for, revenge, would, ally, with, the, french, similarly, he, feared, that, the, russian, army, would, assist, france, to, maintain, a, balance, of, power, still, however, bismarck, believed, that, if, the, german, states, perceived, france, as, the, aggressor, they, would, then, unite, behind, the, king, of, prussia, to, achieve, this, he, kept, napoleon, iii, involved, in, various, intrigues, whereby, france, might, gain, territory, from, luxembourg, or, belgium, france, never, achieved, any, such, gain, but, it, was, made, to, look, greedy, and, untrustworthy, a, suitable, pretext, for, war, arose, in, 1870, when, the, german, prince, leopold, of, hohenzollern, sigmaringen, was, offered, the, spanish, throne, vacant, since, a, revolution, in, 1868, france, pressured, leopold, into, withdrawing, his, candidacy, not, content, with, this, paris, demanded, that, wilhelm, as, head, of, the, house, of, hohenzollern, assure, that, no, hohenzollern, would, ever, seek, the, spanish, crown, again, to, provoke, france, into, declaring, war, with, prussia, bismarck, published, the, ems, dispatch, a, carefully, edited, version, of, a, conversation, between, king, wilhelm, and, the, french, ambassador, to, prussia, count, benedetti, this, conversation, had, been, edited, so, that, each, nation, felt, that, its, ambassador, had, been, slighted, and, ridiculed, thus, inflaming, popular, sentiment, on, both, sides, in, favor, of, war, langer, however, argues, that, this, episode, played, a, minor, role, in, causing, the, war, bismarck, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, he, had, no, doubt, that, a, franco, german, war, must, take, place, before, the, construction, of, a, united, germany, could, be, realised, yet, he, felt, confident, that, the, french, army, was, not, prepared, to, give, battle, to, germany, s, numerically, larger, forces, if, the, french, fight, us, alone, they, are, lost, he, was, also, convinced, that, the, french, would, not, be, able, to, find, allies, since, france, the, victor, would, be, a, danger, to, everybody, prussia, to, nobody, he, added, that, is, our, strong, point, france, mobilized, and, declared, war, on, 19, july, the, german, states, saw, france, as, the, aggressor, and, swept, up, by, nationalism, and, patriotic, zeal, they, rallied, to, prussia, s, side, and, provided, troops, both, of, bismarck, s, sons, served, as, officers, in, the, prussian, cavalry, the, war, was, a, great, success, for, prussia, as, the, german, army, controlled, by, chief, of, staff, moltke, won, victory, after, victory, the, major, battles, were, all, fought, in, one, month, 7, august, to, 1, september, and, both, french, armies, were, captured, at, sedan, and, metz, the, latter, after, a, siege, of, some, weeks, napoleon, iii, was, taken, prisoner, at, sedan, and, kept, in, germany, for, a, time, in, case, bismarck, had, need, of, him, to, head, the, french, regime, he, later, died, in, exile, in, england, in, 1873, the, remainder, of, the, war, featured, a, siege, of, paris, the, city, was, ineffectually, bombarded, the, new, french, republican, regime, then, tried, without, success, to, relieve, paris, with, various, hastily, assembled, armies, and, increasingly, bitter, partisan, warfare, bismarck, quoted, the, first, verse, lyrics, of, la, marseillaise, amongst, others, when, being, recorded, on, an, edison, phonograph, in, 1889, the, only, known, recording, of, his, voice, a, biographer, stated, that, he, did, so, 19, years, after, the, war, to, mock, the, french, bismarck, acted, immediately, to, secure, the, unification, of, germany, he, negotiated, with, representatives, of, the, southern, german, states, offering, special, concessions, if, they, agreed, to, unification, the, negotiations, succeeded, patriotic, sentiment, overwhelmed, what, opposition, remained, while, the, war, was, in, its, final, phase, wilhelm, i, of, prussia, was, proclaimed, german, emperor, on, 18, january, 1871, in, the, hall, of, mirrors, in, the, ch, teau, de, versailles, the, new, german, empire, was, a, federation, each, of, its, 25, constituent, states, kingdoms, grand, duchies, duchies, principalities, and, free, cities, retained, some, autonomy, the, king, of, prussia, as, german, emperor, was, not, sovereign, over, the, entirety, of, germany, he, was, only, primus, inter, pares, or, first, among, equals, however, he, held, the, presidency, of, the, bundesrat, which, met, to, discuss, policy, presented, by, the, chancellor, whom, the, emperor, appointed, in, the, end, france, had, to, cede, alsace, and, part, of, lorraine, as, moltke, and, his, generals, wanted, it, as, a, buffer, historians, debate, whether, bismarck, wanted, this, annexation, or, was, forced, into, it, by, a, wave, of, german, public, and, elite, opinion, france, was, also, required, to, pay, an, indemnity, the, indemnity, figure, was, calculated, on, the, basis, of, population, as, the, precise, equivalent, of, the, indemnity, that, napoleon, i, had, imposed, on, prussia, in, 1807, historians, debate, whether, bismarck, had, a, master, plan, to, expand, the, north, german, confederation, of, 1866, to, include, the, remaining, independent, german, states, into, a, single, entity, or, simply, to, expand, the, power, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, they, conclude, that, factors, in, addition, to, the, strength, of, bismarck, s, realpolitik, led, a, collection, of, early, modern, polities, to, reorganize, political, economic, military, and, diplomatic, relationships, in, the, 19th, century, reaction, to, danish, and, french, nationalism, provided, foci, for, expressions, of, german, unity, military, successes, especially, those, of, prussia, in, three, regional, wars, generated, enthusiasm, and, pride, that, politicians, could, harness, to, promote, unification, this, experience, echoed, the, memory, of, mutual, accomplishment, in, the, napoleonic, wars, particularly, in, the, war, of, liberation, of, 1813, 14, by, establishing, a, germany, without, austria, the, political, and, administrative, unification, in, 1871, at, least, temporarily, solved, the, problem, of, dualism, historian, robert, k, massie, has, noted, bismarck, s, popular, image, was, as, gruff, and, militaristic, while, in, reality, bismarck, s, tool, was, aggressive, ruthless, diplomacy, jonathan, steinberg, said, of, bismarck, s, creation, of, the, german, empire, that, the, first, phase, of, great, career, had, been, concluded, the, genius, statesmen, had, transformed, european, politics, and, had, unified, germany, in, eight, and, a, half, years, and, he, had, done, so, by, sheer, force, of, personality, by, his, brilliance, ruthlessness, and, flexibility, of, principle, marked, the, high, point, of, career, he, had, achieved, the, impossible, and, his, genius, and, the, cult, of, genius, had, no, limits, when, he, returned, to, berlin, in, march, 1871, he, had, become, immortal, defunct, in, 1871, bismarck, was, raised, to, the, rank, of, f, rst, prince, he, was, also, appointed, as, the, first, imperial, chancellor, reichskanzler, of, the, german, empire, but, retained, his, prussian, offices, including, those, of, minister, president, and, foreign, minister, he, was, also, promoted, to, the, rank, of, lieutenant, general, and, bought, a, former, hotel, in, friedrichsruh, near, hamburg, which, became, an, estate, he, also, continued, to, serve, as, his, own, foreign, minister, because, of, both, the, imperial, and, the, prussian, offices, that, he, held, bismarck, had, near, complete, control, over, domestic, and, foreign, policy, the, office, of, minister, president, of, prussia, was, temporarily, separated, from, that, of, chancellor, in, 1873, when, albrecht, von, roon, was, appointed, to, the, former, office, but, by, the, end, of, the, year, roon, resigned, due, to, ill, health, and, bismarck, again, became, minister, president, bismarck, launched, an, anti, catholic, kulturkampf, culture, struggle, in, prussia, in, 1871, this, was, partly, motivated, by, bismarck, s, fear, that, pius, ix, and, his, successors, would, use, papal, infallibility, to, achieve, the, papal, desire, for, international, political, hegemony, the, result, was, the, kulturkampf, which, with, its, largely, prussian, measures, complemented, by, similar, actions, in, several, other, german, states, sought, to, curb, the, clerical, danger, by, legislation, restricting, the, catholic, church, s, political, power, in, may, 1872, bismarck, thus, attempted, to, reach, an, understanding, with, other, european, governments, to, manipulate, future, papal, conclaves, governments, should, agree, beforehand, on, unsuitable, candidates, and, then, instruct, their, national, cardinals, to, vote, appropriately, the, goal, was, to, end, the, pope, s, control, over, the, bishops, in, a, given, state, but, the, project, went, nowhere, bismarck, accelerated, the, kulturkampf, in, its, course, all, prussian, bishops, and, many, priests, were, imprisoned, or, exiled, prussia, s, population, had, greatly, expanded, in, the, 1860s, and, was, now, one, third, catholic, bismarck, believed, that, the, pope, and, bishops, held, too, much, power, over, the, german, catholics, and, was, further, concerned, about, the, emergence, of, the, catholic, centre, party, organised, in, 1870, with, support, from, the, anticlerical, national, liberal, party, which, had, become, bismarck, s, chief, ally, in, the, reichstag, he, abolished, the, catholic, department, of, the, prussian, ministry, of, culture, that, left, the, catholics, without, a, voice, in, high, circles, moreover, in, 1872, the, jesuits, were, expelled, from, germany, in, 1873, more, anti, catholic, laws, allowed, the, prussian, government, to, supervise, the, education, of, the, roman, catholic, clergy, and, curtailed, the, disciplinary, powers, of, the, church, in, 1875, civil, ceremonies, were, required, for, civil, weddings, hitherto, weddings, in, churches, were, civilly, recognized, kulturkampf, became, part, of, bismarck, s, foreign, policy, as, he, sought, to, destabilize, and, weaken, catholic, regimes, especially, in, belgium, and, france, but, he, had, little, success, the, british, ambassador, odo, russell, reported, to, london, in, october, 1872, that, bismarck, s, plans, were, backfiring, by, strengthening, the, ultramontane, pro, papal, position, inside, german, catholicism, the, german, bishops, who, were, politically, powerless, in, germany, and, theologically, in, opposition, to, the, pope, in, rome, have, now, become, powerful, political, leaders, in, germany, and, enthusiastic, defenders, of, the, now, infallible, faith, of, rome, united, disciplined, and, thirsting, for, martyrdom, thanks, to, bismarck, s, uncalled, for, antiliberal, declaration, of, war, on, the, freedom, they, had, hitherto, peacefully, enjoyed, the, catholics, reacted, by, organizing, themselves, and, strengthening, the, centre, party, bismarck, a, devout, pietistic, protestant, was, alarmed, that, secularists, and, socialists, were, using, the, kulturkampf, to, attack, all, religion, he, abandoned, it, in, 1878, to, preserve, his, remaining, political, capital, since, he, now, needed, the, centre, party, votes, in, his, new, battle, against, socialism, pius, ix, died, that, year, replaced, by, the, more, pragmatic, pope, leo, xiii, who, negotiated, away, most, of, the, anti, catholic, laws, the, pope, kept, control, of, the, selection, of, bishops, and, catholics, for, the, most, part, supported, unification, and, most, of, bismarck, s, policies, however, they, never, forgot, his, culture, war, and, preached, solidarity, to, present, organized, resistance, should, it, ever, be, resumed, steinberg, comments, the, anti, catholic, hysteria, in, many, european, countries, belongs, in, its, european, setting, bismarck, s, campaign, was, not, unique, in, itself, but, his, violent, temper, intolerance, of, opposition, and, paranoia, that, secret, forces, had, conspired, to, undermine, his, life, s, work, made, it, more, relentless, his, rage, drove, him, to, exaggerate, the, threat, from, catholic, activities, and, to, respond, with, very, extreme, measures, as, odo, russell, wrote, to, his, mother, the, demonic, is, stronger, in, him, than, in, any, man, i, know, the, bully, the, dictator, and, the, demonic, combined, in, him, with, the, self, pity, and, the, hypochondria, to, create, a, constant, crisis, of, authority, which, he, exploited, for, his, own, ends, opponents, friends, and, subordinates, all, remarked, on, bismarck, as, demonic, a, kind, of, uncanny, diabolic, personal, power, over, men, and, affairs, in, these, years, of, his, greatest, power, he, believed, that, he, could, do, anything, in, 1873, germany, and, much, of, europe, and, america, entered, the, long, depression, the, gr, nderkrise, a, downturn, hit, the, german, economy, for, the, first, time, since, industrial, development, began, to, surge, in, the, 1850s, to, aid, faltering, industries, the, chancellor, abandoned, free, trade, and, established, protectionist, import, tariffs, which, alienated, the, national, liberals, who, demanded, free, trade, the, kulturkampf, and, its, effects, had, also, stirred, up, public, opinion, against, the, party, that, supported, it, and, bismarck, used, this, opportunity, to, distance, himself, from, the, national, liberals, that, marked, a, rapid, decline, in, the, support, of, the, national, liberals, and, by, 1879, their, close, ties, with, bismarck, had, all, but, ended, bismarck, instead, returned, to, conservative, factions, including, the, centre, party, for, support, he, helped, foster, support, from, the, conservatives, by, enacting, several, tariffs, protecting, german, agriculture, and, industry, from, foreign, competitors, in, 1879, imperial, and, provincial, government, bureaucracies, attempted, to, germanise, the, state, s, national, minorities, situated, near, the, borders, of, the, empire, the, danes, in, the, north, the, francophones, in, the, west, and, poles, in, the, east, as, minister, president, of, prussia, and, as, imperial, chancellor, bismarck, sorted, people, into, their, linguistic, tribes, he, pursued, a, policy, of, hostility, in, particular, toward, the, poles, which, was, an, expedient, rooted, in, prussian, history, he, never, had, a, pole, among, his, peasants, working, the, bismarckian, estates, it, was, the, educated, polish, bourgeoisie, and, revolutionaries, he, denounced, from, personal, experience, and, because, of, them, he, disliked, intellectuals, in, politics, bismarck, s, antagonism, is, revealed, in, a, private, letter, to, his, sister, in, 1861, hammer, the, poles, until, they, despair, of, living, i, have, all, the, sympathy, in, the, world, for, their, situation, but, if, we, want, to, exist, we, have, no, choice, but, to, wipe, them, out, wolves, are, only, what, god, made, them, but, we, shoot, them, all, the, same, when, we, can, get, at, them, later, that, year, the, public, bismarck, modified, his, belligerence, and, wrote, to, prussia, s, foreign, minister, every, success, of, the, polish, national, movement, is, a, defeat, for, prussia, we, cannot, carry, on, the, fight, against, this, element, according, to, the, rules, of, civil, justice, but, only, in, accordance, with, the, rules, of, war, bismarck, viewed, the, growing, international, socialist, movement, and, the, non, violent, german, social, democratic, party, sdp, in, particular, with, alarm, since, the, sdp, s, existence, was, protected, by, the, terms, of, the, german, constitution, bismarck, found, ways, to, weaken, it, short, of, an, outright, ban, in, 1878, he, instituted, the, first, of, a, series, of, repressive, anti, socialist, laws, forbidding, socialist, organizations, and, meetings, outlawing, trade, unions, closing, newspapers, and, banning, the, circulation, of, socialist, literature, the, spd, continued, to, take, part, in, the, elections, but, police, officers, were, now, empowered, to, stop, search, and, arrest, sdp, members, and, their, leaders, numbers, of, whom, were, then, tried, by, police, courts, one, way, socialists, used, to, get, around, these, harsh, measures, was, to, run, as, independent, candidates, unaffiliated, with, any, party, despite, or, possibly, because, of, the, laws, the, sdp, steadily, gained, supporters, and, seats, in, the, reichstag, during, the, 1880s, bismarck, also, tried, to, win, the, allegiance, of, working, classes, to, the, conservative, regime, by, implementing, positive, social, benefits, such, as, accident, and, old, age, insurance, as, well, as, pioneering, a, form, of, socialized, medicine, reforms, which, are, now, grouped, under, the, label, state, socialism, bismarck, himself, called, it, that, in, addition, to, referring, to, them, as, practical, christianity, the, whole, problem, is, rooted, in, the, question, does, the, state, have, the, responsibility, to, care, for, its, helpless, fellow, citizens, or, does, it, not, i, maintain, that, it, does, have, this, duty, and, to, be, sure, not, simply, the, christian, state, as, i, once, permitted, myself, to, allude, to, with, the, words, practical, christianity, but, rather, every, state, by, its, very, nature, there, are, objectives, that, only, the, state, in, its, totality, can, fulfill, among, the, last, mentioned, objectives, belong, national, defense, the, general, system, of, transportation, to, these, belong, also, the, help, of, persons, in, distress, and, the, prevention, of, such, justified, complaints, as, in, fact, provide, excellent, material, for, exploitation, by, the, social, democrats, that, is, the, responsibility, of, the, state, from, which, the, state, will, not, be, able, to, withdraw, in, the, long, run, bismarck, s, reichstag, speech, on, the, law, for, workmen, s, compensation, p, 4, march, 15, 1884, yet, notwithstanding, these, strategies, bismarck, did, not, completely, succeed, in, crushing, socialism, support, for, the, sdp, increased, with, each, election, one, of, the, secrets, of, bismarck, s, success, was, his, careful, in, depth, study, of, the, national, interest, of, all, the, other, states, he, thereby, avoided, the, pitfall, of, misunderstandings, that, led, to, conflicts, even, more, important, he, identified, opportunities, whereby, the, national, interest, of, another, state, was, congruent, to, that, of, germany, and, a, deal, could, be, achieved, to, the, benefit, of, both, summarizing, bismarck, s, mastery, of, diplomacy, jonathan, steinberg, argues, the, powerful, imperial, german, army, was, under, the, control, of, bismarck, s, close, ally, field, marshall, helmuth, von, moltke, the, elder, it, was, a, model, of, professionalism, although, it, fought, no, wars, the, imperial, german, navy, was, small, under, bismarck, after, fifteen, years, of, warfare, in, the, crimea, germany, and, france, europe, began, a, period, of, peace, in, 1871, with, the, founding, of, the, german, empire, in, 1871, bismarck, emerged, as, a, decisive, figure, in, european, history, from, 1871, to, 1890, he, retained, control, over, prussia, and, as, well, as, the, foreign, and, domestic, policies, of, the, new, german, empire, bismarck, had, built, his, reputation, as, a, war, maker, but, changed, overnight, into, a, peacemaker, in, this, role, he, employed, balance, of, power, diplomacy, to, maintain, germany, s, position, in, a, europe, which, despite, many, disputes, and, war, scares, remained, at, peace, for, historian, eric, hobsbawm, it, was, bismarck, who, remained, undisputed, world, champion, at, the, game, of, multilateral, diplomatic, chess, for, almost, twenty, years, after, 1871, devoted, himself, exclusively, and, successfully, to, maintaining, peace, between, the, powers, historian, paul, knaplund, concludes, bismarck, s, main, mistake, was, giving, in, to, the, army, and, to, intense, public, demand, in, germany, for, acquisition, of, the, border, provinces, of, alsace, and, lorraine, thereby, turning, france, into, a, permanent, deeply, committed, enemy, see, french, german, enmity, theodore, zeldin, says, revenge, and, the, recovery, of, alsace, lorraine, became, a, principal, object, of, french, policy, for, the, next, forty, years, that, germany, was, france, s, enemy, became, the, basic, fact, of, international, relations, bismarck, s, solution, was, to, make, france, a, pariah, nation, encouraging, royalty, to, ridicule, its, new, republican, status, and, building, complex, alliances, with, the, other, major, powers, austria, hungary, russia, and, britain, to, keep, france, isolated, diplomatically, a, key, element, was, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, in, which, bismarck, brought, together, rulers, in, berlin, vienna, and, st, petersburg, to, guarantee, each, other, s, security, while, blocking, out, france, it, lasted, 1881, 1887, having, unified, his, nation, bismarck, now, devoted, himself, to, preventing, war, in, europe, with, his, skills, in, statesmanship, he, was, forced, to, contend, with, french, revanchism, the, desire, to, avenge, the, losses, of, the, franco, prussian, war, bismarck, therefore, engaged, in, a, policy, of, diplomatically, isolating, france, while, maintaining, cordial, relations, with, other, nations, in, europe, he, had, little, interest, in, naval, or, colonial, entanglements, and, thus, avoided, discord, with, great, britain, historians, emphasize, that, he, wanted, no, more, territorial, gains, after, 1871, and, vigorously, worked, to, form, cross, linking, alliances, that, prevented, any, war, in, europe, from, starting, by, 1878, both, the, liberal, and, conservative, spokesmen, in, britain, hailed, him, as, the, champion, of, peace, in, europe, a, j, p, taylor, a, leading, british, diplomatic, historian, concludes, that, bismarck, was, an, honest, broker, of, peace, and, his, system, of, alliances, compelled, every, power, whatever, its, will, to, follow, a, peaceful, course, well, aware, that, europe, was, sceptical, of, his, powerful, new, reich, bismarck, turned, his, attention, to, preserving, the, status, quo, in, europe, based, on, a, balance, of, power, that, would, allow, germany, s, economy, to, flourish, bismarck, feared, that, a, hostile, combination, of, austria, hungary, france, and, russia, would, crush, germany, if, two, of, them, were, allied, then, the, third, would, ally, with, germany, only, if, germany, conceded, excessive, demands, the, solution, was, to, ally, with, two, of, the, three, in, 1873, he, formed, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, dreikaiserbund, an, alliance, of, wilhelm, tsar, alexander, ii, of, russia, and, emperor, francis, joseph, of, austria, hungary, together, they, would, control, eastern, europe, making, sure, that, restive, ethnic, groups, such, as, the, poles, were, kept, under, control, the, balkans, posed, a, more, serious, issue, and, bismarck, s, solution, was, to, give, austria, hungary, predominance, in, the, western, areas, and, russia, in, the, eastern, areas, this, system, collapsed, in, 1887, in, 1872, a, protracted, quarrel, began, to, fester, between, bismarck, and, count, harry, von, arnim, the, imperial, ambassador, to, france, arnim, saw, himself, as, a, rival, and, competitor, for, the, chancellorship, but, the, rivalry, escalated, out, of, hand, and, arnim, took, sensitive, records, from, embassy, files, at, paris, to, back, up, his, case, he, was, formally, accused, of, misappropriating, official, documents, indicted, tried, and, convicted, finally, fleeing, into, exile, where, he, died, no, one, again, openly, challenged, bismarck, in, foreign, policy, matters, until, his, resignation, france, was, bismarck, s, main, problem, peaceful, relations, with, france, became, impossible, after, 1871, when, germany, annexed, all, of, the, province, of, alsace, and, much, of, lorraine, public, opinion, demanded, it, to, humiliate, france, and, the, army, wanted, its, more, defensible, frontiers, bismarck, reluctantly, gave, in, the, french, would, never, forget, or, forgive, he, calculated, so, might, as, well, take, the, provinces, that, was, a, mistaken, assumption, after, about, five, years, the, french, did, calm, down, and, considered, it, a, minor, issue, germany, s, foreign, policy, fell, into, a, trap, with, no, exit, in, retrospect, it, is, easy, to, see, that, the, annexation, of, alsace, lorraine, was, a, tragic, mistake, once, the, annexation, took, place, the, only, policy, that, made, sense, was, trying, to, isolate, france, so, it, had, no, strong, allies, however, france, complicated, berlin, s, plans, when, it, became, friends, with, russia, in, 1905, a, german, plan, for, an, alliance, with, russia, fell, through, because, russia, was, too, close, to, france, between, 1873, and, 1877, germany, repeatedly, manipulated, the, internal, affairs, of, france, s, neighbors, to, hurt, france, bismarck, put, heavy, pressure, on, belgium, spain, and, italy, hoping, to, obtain, the, election, of, liberal, anticlerical, governments, his, plan, was, to, promote, republicanism, in, france, by, isolating, the, clerical, monarchist, regime, of, president, patrice, de, macmahon, he, hoped, that, surrounding, france, with, liberal, states, would, help, the, french, republicans, defeat, macmahon, and, his, reactionary, supporters, the, bullying, however, almost, got, out, of, hand, in, mid, 1875, when, an, editorial, entitled, krieg, in, sicht, war, in, sight, was, published, in, a, berlin, newspaper, close, to, the, government, the, post, the, editorial, indicated, that, highly, influential, germans, were, alarmed, by, france, s, rapid, recovery, from, defeat, in, 1875, and, its, announcement, of, an, increase, in, the, size, of, its, army, as, well, as, talks, of, launching, a, preventive, war, against, france, bismarck, denied, knowing, about, the, article, ahead, of, time, but, he, certainly, knew, about, the, talk, of, preventive, war, the, editorial, produced, a, war, scare, with, britain, and, russia, warning, that, they, would, not, tolerate, a, preventive, war, against, france, bismarck, had, no, desire, for, war, either, and, the, crisis, soon, blew, over, it, was, a, rare, instance, where, bismarck, was, outmaneuvered, and, embarrassed, by, his, opponents, but, from, that, he, learned, an, important, lesson, it, forced, him, to, take, into, account, the, fear, and, alarm, that, his, bullying, and, germany, s, fast, growing, power, was, causing, among, its, neighbors, and, reinforced, his, determination, that, germany, should, work, in, proactive, fashion, to, preserve, the, peace, in, europe, rather, than, passively, let, events, take, their, own, course, and, reacting, to, them, bismarck, maintained, good, relations, with, italy, although, he, had, a, personal, dislike, for, italians, and, their, country, he, can, be, seen, as, a, marginal, contributor, to, italian, unification, politics, surrounding, the, 1866, austro, prussian, war, allowed, italy, to, annex, venetia, which, had, been, a, kronland, crown, land, of, the, austrian, empire, since, the, 1815, congress, of, vienna, in, addition, french, mobilization, for, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, 1871, made, it, necessary, for, napoleon, iii, to, withdraw, his, troops, from, rome, and, the, papal, states, without, these, two, events, italian, unification, would, have, been, a, more, prolonged, process, after, russia, s, victory, over, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, russo, turkish, war, of, 1877, 1878, bismarck, helped, negotiate, a, settlement, at, the, congress, of, berlin, the, treaty, of, berlin, revised, the, earlier, treaty, of, san, stefano, reducing, the, size, and, sovereignty, of, the, new, principality, of, bulgaria, a, pro, russian, state, at, that, time, bismarck, and, other, european, leaders, opposed, the, growth, of, russian, influence, and, tried, to, protect, the, integrity, of, the, ottoman, empire, see, eastern, question, as, a, result, russo, german, relations, further, deteriorated, with, the, russian, foreign, minister, gorchakov, denouncing, bismarck, for, compromising, his, nation, s, victory, the, relationship, was, additionally, strained, due, to, germany, s, protectionist, trade, policies, some, in, the, german, military, clamored, for, a, preemptive, war, with, russia, bismarck, refused, stating, preemptive, war, is, like, committing, suicide, for, fear, of, death, bismarck, realized, that, both, russia, and, britain, considered, control, of, central, asia, a, high, priority, dubbed, the, great, game, germany, had, no, direct, stakes, however, its, dominance, of, europe, was, enhanced, when, russian, troops, were, based, as, far, away, from, germany, as, possible, over, two, decades, 1871, 1890, he, maneuvered, to, help, the, british, hoping, to, force, the, russians, to, commit, more, soldiers, to, asia, the, league, of, the, three, emperors, having, fallen, apart, bismarck, negotiated, the, dual, alliance, with, austria, hungary, in, which, each, guaranteed, the, other, against, russian, attack, he, also, negotiated, the, triple, alliance, in, 1882, with, austria, hungary, and, italy, and, italy, and, austria, hungary, soon, reached, the, mediterranean, agreement, with, britain, attempts, to, reconcile, germany, and, russia, did, not, have, a, lasting, effect, the, three, emperors, league, was, re, established, in, 1881, but, quickly, fell, apart, ending, russian, austrian, prussian, solidarity, which, had, existed, in, various, forms, since, 1813, bismarck, therefore, negotiated, the, secret, reinsurance, treaty, of, 1887, with, russia, in, order, to, prevent, franco, russian, encirclement, of, germany, both, powers, promised, to, remain, neutral, towards, one, another, unless, russia, attacked, austria, hungary, however, after, bismarck, s, departure, from, office, in, 1890, the, treaty, was, not, renewed, thus, creating, a, critical, problem, for, germany, in, the, event, of, a, war, bismarck, had, opposed, colonial, acquisitions, arguing, that, the, burden, of, obtaining, maintaining, and, defending, such, possessions, would, outweigh, any, potential, benefit, he, felt, that, colonies, did, not, pay, for, themselves, that, the, german, formal, bureaucratic, system, would, not, work, well, in, the, easy, going, tropics, and, that, the, diplomatic, disputes, colonies, brought, would, distract, germany, from, its, central, interest, europe, itself, as, for, french, designs, on, morocco, chlodwig, prince, of, hohenlohe, schillingsf, rst, wrote, in, his, memoirs, that, bismarck, had, told, him, that, germany, could, only, be, pleased, if, france, took, possession, of, the, country, since, she, would, then, be, very, occupied, and, distracted, from, the, loss, of, alsace, lorraine, however, in, 1883, 1884, he, suddenly, reversed, himself, and, overnight, built, a, colonial, empire, in, africa, and, the, south, pacific, the, berlin, conference, of, 1884, 1885, organized, by, bismarck, can, be, seen, as, the, formalization, of, the, scramble, for, africa, historians, have, debated, the, exact, motive, behind, bismarck, s, sudden, and, short, lived, move, he, was, aware, that, public, opinion, had, started, to, demand, colonies, for, reasons, of, german, prestige, he, also, wanted, to, undercut, the, anti, colonial, liberals, who, were, sponsored, by, the, crown, prince, who, given, wilhelm, i, s, old, age, might, soon, become, emperor, and, remove, bismarck, bismarck, was, influenced, by, hamburg, merchants, and, traders, his, neighbors, at, friedrichsruh, the, establishment, of, the, german, colonial, empire, proceeded, smoothly, starting, with, german, new, guinea, in, 1884, other, european, nations, led, by, britain, and, france, were, acquiring, colonies, in, a, rapid, fashion, see, new, imperialism, bismarck, therefore, made, the, decision, to, join, the, scramble, for, africa, germany, s, new, colonies, included, togoland, now, togo, and, part, of, ghana, german, kamerun, now, cameroon, and, part, of, nigeria, german, east, africa, now, rwanda, burundi, and, the, mainland, part, of, tanzania, and, german, south, west, africa, now, namibia, the, berlin, conference, 1884, 1885, established, regulations, for, the, acquisition, of, african, colonies, in, particular, it, protected, free, trade, in, certain, parts, of, the, congo, basin, germany, also, acquired, colonies, in, the, pacific, such, as, german, new, guinea, hans, ulrich, wehler, argues, that, his, imperialistic, policies, were, based, on, internal, political, and, economic, forces, they, were, not, his, response, to, external, pressure, at, first, he, promoted, liberal, goals, of, free, trade, commercial, expansionism, in, order, to, maintain, economic, growth, and, social, stability, as, well, as, preserve, the, social, and, political, power, structure, however, he, changed, broke, with, the, liberals, and, adopted, tariffs, to, win, catholic, support, and, shore, up, his, political, base, germany, s, imperialism, in, the, 1880s, derived, less, from, strength, and, instead, represented, bismarck, s, solution, to, unstable, industrialization, protectionism, made, for, unity, at, a, time, when, class, conflict, was, rising, wehler, says, the, chancellor, s, ultimate, goal, was, to, strengthen, traditional, social, and, power, structures, and, avoid, a, major, war, in, february, 1888, during, a, bulgarian, crisis, bismarck, addressed, the, reichstag, on, the, dangers, of, a, european, war, he, warned, of, the, imminent, possibility, that, germany, will, have, to, fight, on, two, fronts, he, spoke, of, the, desire, for, peace, then, he, set, forth, the, balkan, case, for, war, and, demonstrated, its, futility, bulgaria, that, little, country, between, the, danube, and, the, balkans, is, far, from, being, an, object, of, adequate, importance, for, which, to, plunge, europe, from, moscow, to, the, pyrenees, and, from, the, north, sea, to, palermo, into, a, war, whose, issue, no, man, can, foresee, at, the, end, of, the, conflict, we, should, scarcely, know, why, we, had, fought, bismarck, also, repeated, his, emphatic, warning, against, any, german, military, involvement, in, balkan, disputes, bismarck, had, first, made, this, famous, comment, to, the, reichstag, in, december, 1876, when, the, balkan, revolts, against, the, ottoman, empire, threatened, to, extend, to, a, war, between, austria, hungary, and, russia, only, a, year, later, he, is, faced, by, the, alternative, of, espousing, the, cause, of, russia, or, that, of, austria, hungary, immediately, after, the, last, crisis, in, the, summer, of, 1875, the, mutual, jealousies, between, russia, and, austria, hungary, had, been, rendered, acute, by, the, fresh, risings, in, the, balkans, against, the, turks, now, the, issues, hung, upon, bismarck, s, decision, immediately, after, the, peace, he, had, tried, to, paralyse, the, balkan, rivals, by, the, formation, of, the, three, emperors, league, i, have, no, thought, of, intervening, he, said, privately, that, might, precipitate, a, european, war, if, i, were, to, espouse, the, cause, of, one, of, the, parties, france, would, promptly, strike, a, blow, on, the, other, side, i, am, holding, two, powerful, heraldic, beasts, by, their, collars, and, am, keeping, them, apart, for, two, reasons, first, of, all, lest, they, should, tear, one, another, to, pieces, and, secondly, lest, they, should, come, to, an, understanding, at, our, expense, in, the, reichstag, he, popularises, the, same, idea, in, the, words, i, am, opposed, to, the, notion, of, any, sort, of, active, participation, of, germany, in, these, matters, so, long, as, i, can, see, no, reason, to, suppose, that, german, interests, are, involved, no, interests, on, behalf, of, which, it, is, worth, our, risking, excuse, my, plain, speaking, the, healthy, bones, of, one, of, our, pomeranian, musketeers, a, leading, diplomatic, historian, of, the, era, william, l, langer, sums, up, bismarck, s, two, decades, as, chancellor, whatever, else, may, be, said, of, the, intricate, alliance, system, evolved, by, the, german, chancellor, it, must, be, admitted, that, it, worked, and, that, it, tided, europe, over, a, period, of, several, critical, years, without, a, rupture, there, was, as, bismarck, himself, said, a, premium, upon, the, maintenance, of, peace, langer, concludes, his, had, been, a, great, career, beginning, with, three, wars, in, eight, years, and, ending, with, a, period, of, 20, years, during, which, he, worked, for, the, peace, of, europe, despite, countless, opportunities, to, embark, on, further, enterprises, with, more, than, even, chance, of, success, no, other, statesman, of, his, standing, had, ever, before, shown, the, same, great, moderation, and, sound, political, sense, of, the, possible, and, desirable, bismarck, at, least, deserves, full, credit, for, having, steered, european, politics, through, this, dangerous, transitional, period, without, serious, conflict, between, the, great, powers, bismarck, s, social, legislation, was, a, reaction, to, the, social, question, triggered, by, industrialisation, in, domestic, policy, bismarck, pursued, a, conservative, state, building, strategy, designed, to, make, ordinary, germans, not, just, his, own, junker, elite, more, loyal, to, throne, and, empire, implementing, the, modern, welfare, state, in, germany, in, the, 1880s, according, to, kees, van, kersbergen, and, barbara, vis, his, strategy, was, granting, social, rights, to, enhance, the, integration, of, a, hierarchical, society, to, forge, a, bond, between, workers, and, the, state, so, as, to, strengthen, the, latter, to, maintain, traditional, relations, of, authority, between, social, and, status, groups, and, to, provide, a, countervailing, power, against, the, modernist, forces, of, liberalism, and, socialism, bismarck, worked, closely, with, large, industry, and, aimed, to, stimulate, german, economic, growth, by, giving, workers, greater, security, a, secondary, concern, was, trumping, the, social, democrats, who, had, no, welfare, proposals, of, their, own, and, opposed, bismarck, s, bismarck, especially, listened, to, hermann, wagener, and, theodor, lohmann, advisers, who, persuaded, him, to, give, workers, a, corporate, status, in, the, legal, and, political, structures, of, the, new, german, state, in, march, 1884, bismarck, declared, the, real, grievance, of, the, worker, is, the, insecurity, of, his, existence, he, is, not, sure, that, he, will, always, have, work, he, is, not, sure, that, he, will, always, be, healthy, and, he, foresees, that, he, will, one, day, be, old, and, unfit, to, work, if, he, falls, into, poverty, even, if, only, through, a, prolonged, illness, he, is, then, completely, helpless, left, to, his, own, devices, and, society, does, not, currently, recognize, any, real, obligation, towards, him, beyond, the, usual, help, for, the, poor, even, if, he, has, been, working, all, the, time, ever, so, faithfully, and, diligently, the, usual, help, for, the, poor, however, leaves, a, lot, to, be, desired, especially, in, large, cities, where, it, is, very, much, worse, than, in, the, country, bismarck, s, idea, was, to, implement, welfare, programs, that, were, acceptable, to, conservatives, without, any, socialistic, aspects, he, was, dubious, about, laws, protecting, workers, at, the, workplace, such, as, safe, working, conditions, limitation, of, work, hours, and, the, regulation, of, women, s, and, child, labor, he, believed, that, such, regulation, would, force, workers, and, employers, to, reduce, work, and, production, and, thus, harm, the, economy, bismarck, opened, debate, on, the, subject, in, november, 1881, in, the, imperial, message, to, the, reichstag, using, the, term, practical, christianity, to, describe, his, program, bismarck, s, program, centred, squarely, on, insurance, programs, designed, to, increase, productivity, and, focus, the, political, attentions, of, german, workers, on, supporting, the, junkers, government, the, program, included, sickness, insurance, accident, insurance, disability, insurance, and, a, retirement, pension, none, of, which, were, then, in, existence, to, any, great, degree, based, on, bismarck, s, message, the, reichstag, filed, three, bills, to, deal, with, the, concepts, of, accident, and, sickness, insurance, the, subjects, of, retirement, pensions, and, disability, insurance, were, placed, on, the, back, burner, for, the, time, being, the, social, legislation, implemented, by, bismarck, in, the, 1880s, played, a, key, role, in, the, sharp, rapid, decline, of, german, emigration, to, america, young, men, considering, emigration, looked, at, not, only, the, gap, between, higher, hourly, direct, wages, in, the, united, states, and, germany, but, also, the, differential, in, indirect, wages, social, benefits, which, favored, staying, in, germany, the, young, men, went, to, german, industrial, cities, so, that, bismarck, s, insurance, system, partly, offset, low, wage, rates, in, germany, and, further, reduced, the, emigration, rate, the, first, successful, bill, passed, in, 1883, was, the, sickness, insurance, bill, bismarck, considered, the, program, established, to, provide, sickness, insurance, for, german, industrial, laborers, the, least, important, and, the, least, politically, troublesome, the, health, service, was, established, on, a, local, basis, with, the, cost, divided, between, employers, and, the, employed, the, employers, contributed, one, third, and, the, workers, contributed, two, thirds, the, minimum, payments, for, medical, treatment, and, sick, pay, for, up, to, 13, weeks, were, legally, fixed, the, individual, local, health, bureaus, were, administered, by, a, committee, elected, by, the, members, of, each, bureau, and, this, move, had, the, unintended, effect, of, establishing, a, majority, representation, for, the, workers, on, account, of, their, large, financial, contribution, this, worked, to, the, advantage, of, the, social, democrats, who, through, heavy, worker, membership, achieved, their, first, small, foothold, in, public, administration, according, to, a, 2019, study, the, health, insurance, legislation, caused, a, substantial, reduction, in, mortality, bismarck, s, government, had, to, submit, three, draft, bills, before, it, could, get, one, passed, by, the, reichstag, in, 1884, bismarck, had, originally, proposed, that, the, federal, government, pay, a, portion, of, the, accident, insurance, contribution, bismarck, wanted, to, demonstrate, the, willingness, of, the, german, government, to, reduce, the, hardship, experienced, by, the, german, workers, so, as, to, wean, them, away, from, supporting, the, various, left, wing, parties, most, importantly, the, social, democrats, the, national, liberals, took, this, program, to, be, an, expression, of, state, socialism, against, which, they, were, dead, set, the, centre, party, was, afraid, of, the, expansion, of, federal, power, at, the, expense, of, states, rights, as, a, result, the, only, way, the, program, could, be, passed, at, all, was, for, the, entire, expense, to, be, underwritten, by, the, employers, to, facilitate, this, bismarck, arranged, for, the, administration, of, this, program, to, be, placed, in, the, hands, of, der, arbeitgeberverband, in, den, beruflichen, korporationen, the, organization, of, employers, in, occupational, corporations, this, organization, established, central, and, bureaucratic, insurance, offices, on, the, federal, and, in, some, cases, the, state, level, to, actually, administer, the, program, whose, benefits, kicked, in, to, replace, the, sickness, insurance, program, as, of, the, 14th, week, it, paid, for, medical, treatment, and, a, pension, of, up, to, two, thirds, of, earned, wages, if, the, worker, were, fully, disabled, this, program, was, expanded, in, 1886, to, include, agricultural, workers, the, old, age, pension, program, insurance, equally, financed, by, employers, and, workers, was, designed, to, provide, a, pension, annuity, for, workers, who, reached, the, age, of, 70, unlike, the, accident, and, sickness, insurance, programs, this, program, covered, all, categories, of, workers, industrial, agrarian, artisans, and, servants, from, the, start, also, unlike, the, other, two, programs, the, principle, that, the, national, government, should, contribute, a, portion, of, the, underwriting, cost, with, the, other, two, portions, prorated, accordingly, was, accepted, without, question, the, disability, insurance, program, was, intended, to, be, used, by, those, permanently, disabled, this, time, the, state, or, province, supervised, the, programs, directly, in, 1888, kaiser, wilhelm, i, died, he, left, the, throne, to, his, son, frederick, iii, the, new, monarch, was, already, suffering, from, cancer, of, the, larynx, and, died, after, reigning, for, only, 99, days, he, was, succeeded, by, his, son, wilhelm, ii, who, opposed, bismarck, s, careful, foreign, policy, preferring, vigorous, and, rapid, expansion, to, enlarge, germany, s, place, in, the, sun, bismarck, was, sixteen, years, older, than, frederick, before, the, latter, became, terminally, ill, bismarck, did, not, expect, he, would, live, to, see, wilhelm, ascend, to, the, throne, and, thus, had, no, strategy, to, deal, with, him, conflicts, between, wilhelm, and, his, chancellor, soon, poisoned, their, relationship, their, final, split, occurred, after, bismarck, tried, to, implement, far, reaching, anti, socialist, laws, in, early, 1890, the, kartell, majority, in, the, reichstag, including, the, amalgamated, conservative, party, and, the, national, liberal, party, was, willing, to, make, most, of, the, laws, permanent, however, it, was, split, about, the, law, granting, the, police, the, power, to, expel, socialist, agitators, from, their, homes, a, power, that, had, been, used, excessively, at, times, against, political, opponents, the, national, liberals, refused, to, make, this, law, permanent, while, the, conservatives, supported, only, the, entirety, of, the, bill, threatening, to, and, eventually, vetoing, the, entire, bill, in, session, because, bismarck, would, not, agree, to, a, modified, bill, as, the, debate, continued, wilhelm, became, increasingly, interested, in, social, problems, especially, the, treatment, of, mine, workers, during, their, strike, in, 1889, keeping, with, his, active, policy, in, government, he, routinely, interrupted, bismarck, in, council, to, make, clear, his, social, views, bismarck, sharply, disagreed, with, wilhelm, s, policies, and, worked, to, circumvent, them, even, though, wilhelm, supported, the, altered, anti, socialist, bill, bismarck, pushed, for, his, support, to, veto, the, bill, in, its, entirety, when, his, arguments, could, not, convince, wilhelm, bismarck, became, excited, and, agitated, until, uncharacteristically, blurting, out, his, motive, to, see, the, bill, fail, to, have, the, socialists, agitate, until, a, violent, clash, occurred, that, could, be, used, as, a, pretext, to, crush, them, wilhelm, countered, that, he, was, not, willing, to, open, his, reign, with, a, bloody, campaign, against, his, own, subjects, the, next, day, after, realizing, his, blunder, bismarck, attempted, to, reach, a, compromise, with, wilhelm, by, agreeing, to, his, social, policy, towards, industrial, workers, and, even, suggested, a, european, council, to, discuss, working, conditions, presided, over, by, the, emperor, still, a, turn, of, events, eventually, led, to, his, breaking, with, wilhelm, bismarck, feeling, pressured, and, unappreciated, by, the, emperor, and, undermined, by, ambitious, advisers, refused, to, sign, a, proclamation, regarding, the, protection, of, workers, along, with, wilhelm, as, was, required, by, the, german, constitution, his, refusal, to, sign, was, apparently, to, protest, wilhelm, s, ever, increasing, interference, with, bismarck, s, previously, unquestioned, authority, bismarck, also, worked, behind, the, scenes, to, break, the, continental, labour, council, on, which, wilhelm, had, set, his, heart, the, final, break, came, as, bismarck, searched, for, a, new, parliamentary, majority, as, his, kartell, was, voted, from, power, as, a, consequence, of, the, anti, socialist, bill, fiasco, the, remaining, forces, in, the, reichstag, were, the, catholic, centre, party, and, the, conservative, party, bismarck, wished, to, form, a, new, block, with, the, centre, party, and, invited, ludwig, windthorst, the, parliamentary, leader, to, discuss, an, alliance, that, would, be, bismarck, s, last, political, maneuver, upon, hearing, about, windthorst, s, visit, wilhelm, was, furious, in, a, parliamentary, state, the, head, of, government, depends, on, the, confidence, of, the, parliamentary, majority, and, has, the, right, to, form, coalitions, to, ensure, their, policies, have, majority, support, however, in, germany, the, chancellor, depended, on, the, confidence, of, the, emperor, alone, and, wilhelm, believed, that, the, emperor, had, the, right, to, be, informed, before, his, minister, s, meeting, after, a, heated, argument, in, bismarck, s, office, wilhelm, to, whom, bismarck, had, shown, a, letter, from, tsar, alexander, iii, describing, wilhelm, as, a, badly, brought, up, boy, stormed, out, after, first, ordering, the, rescinding, of, the, cabinet, order, enacted, in, 1851, by, frederick, william, iv, of, prussia, which, had, forbidden, prussian, cabinet, ministers, from, reporting, directly, to, the, king, of, prussia, and, required, them, instead, to, report, via, the, prussian, prime, minister, bismarck, forced, for, the, first, time, into, a, situation, that, he, could, not, use, to, his, advantage, wrote, a, blistering, letter, of, resignation, decrying, wilhelm, s, interference, in, foreign, and, domestic, policy, the, letter, however, was, published, only, after, bismarck, s, death, bismarck, resigned, at, wilhelm, ii, s, insistence, on, 18, march, 1890, at, the, age, of, 75, he, was, succeeded, as, imperial, chancellor, and, minister, president, of, prussia, by, leo, von, caprivi, after, his, dismissal, he, was, promoted, to, the, rank, of, colonel, general, with, the, dignity, of, field, marshal, so, called, because, the, german, army, did, not, appoint, full, field, marshals, in, peacetime, he, was, also, given, a, new, title, duke, of, lauenburg, which, he, joked, would, be, useful, when, traveling, incognito, he, was, soon, elected, to, the, reichstag, as, a, national, liberal, in, bennigsen, s, old, and, supposedly, safe, hamburg, seat, but, he, was, so, humiliated, by, being, taken, to, a, second, ballot, by, a, social, democrat, opponent, that, he, never, actually, took, up, his, seat, bismarck, entered, into, resentful, retirement, lived, in, friedrichsruh, near, hamburg, and, sometimes, on, his, estates, at, varzin, and, waited, in, vain, to, be, called, upon, for, advice, and, counsel, after, his, wife, s, death, on, 27, november, 1894, his, health, worsened, and, one, year, later, he, finally, became, a, full, time, wheelchair, user, bismarck, spent, his, final, years, composing, his, memoirs, gedanken, und, erinnerungen, or, thoughts, and, memories, a, work, lauded, by, historians, in, the, memoirs, bismarck, continued, his, feud, with, wilhelm, ii, by, attacking, him, and, by, increasing, the, drama, around, every, event, and, by, often, presenting, himself, in, a, favorable, light, he, also, published, the, text, of, the, reinsurance, treaty, with, russia, a, major, breach, of, national, security, for, which, an, individual, of, lesser, status, would, have, been, heavily, prosecuted, bismarck, s, health, began, to, fail, in, 1896, he, was, diagnosed, with, gangrene, in, his, foot, but, refused, to, accept, treatment, for, it, as, a, result, he, had, difficulty, walking, and, often, used, a, wheelchair, by, july, 1898, he, was, a, full, time, wheelchair, user, had, trouble, breathing, and, was, almost, constantly, feverish, and, in, pain, his, health, rallied, momentarily, on, the, 28th, but, then, sharply, deteriorated, over, the, next, two, days, he, died, just, after, midnight, on, 30, july, 1898, at, the, age, of, 83, in, friedrichsruh, where, he, is, entombed, in, the, bismarck, mausoleum, he, was, succeeded, as, prince, bismarck, by, his, eldest, son, herbert, bismarck, managed, a, posthumous, snub, of, wilhelm, ii, by, having, his, own, sarcophagus, inscribed, with, the, words, a, loyal, german, servant, of, emperor, wilhelm, i, he, married, johanna, von, puttkamer, in, 1847, they, had, three, children, marie, b, 1848, herbert, b, 1849, and, wilhelm, b, 1852, historians, have, reached, a, broad, consensus, on, the, content, function, and, importance, of, the, image, of, bismarck, within, germany, s, political, culture, over, the, past, 125, years, according, to, steinberg, his, achievements, in, 1862, 1871, were, the, greatest, diplomatic, and, political, achievement, by, any, leader, in, the, last, two, centuries, bismarck, s, most, important, legacy, is, the, unification, of, germany, germany, had, existed, as, a, collection, of, hundreds, of, separate, principalities, and, free, cities, since, the, formation, of, the, holy, roman, empire, over, the, centuries, various, rulers, had, tried, to, unify, the, german, states, without, success, until, bismarck, largely, as, a, result, of, bismarck, s, efforts, the, various, german, kingdoms, were, united, into, a, single, country, following, unification, germany, became, one, of, the, most, powerful, nations, in, europe, bismarck, s, astute, cautious, and, pragmatic, foreign, policies, allowed, germany, to, peacefully, retain, the, powerful, position, into, which, he, had, brought, it, while, maintaining, amiable, diplomacy, with, almost, all, european, nations, france, was, the, main, exception, because, of, the, franco, prussian, war, and, bismarck, s, harsh, subsequent, policies, france, became, one, of, germany, s, most, bitter, enemies, in, europe, austria, too, was, weakened, by, the, creation, of, a, german, empire, though, to, a, much, lesser, extent, than, france, bismarck, believed, that, as, long, as, britain, russia, and, italy, were, assured, of, the, peaceful, nature, of, the, german, empire, french, belligerency, could, be, contained, his, diplomatic, feats, were, undone, however, by, kaiser, wilhelm, ii, whose, policies, unified, other, european, powers, against, germany, in, time, for, world, war, i, historians, stress, that, bismarck, s, peace, oriented, saturated, continental, diplomacy, was, increasingly, unpopular, because, it, consciously, reined, in, any, expansionist, drives, the, german, public, turned, to, an, expansionist, stance, instead, in, dramatic, contrast, to, bismarck, s, approach, stands, the, ambition, of, wilhelm, ii, s, weltpolitik, to, secure, the, reich, s, future, through, expansion, leading, to, world, war, i, likewise, bismarck, s, policy, to, deny, the, military, a, dominant, voice, in, foreign, political, decision, making, was, overturned, by, 1914, as, germany, was, increasingly, under, military, control, during, the, war, the, oberste, heeresleitung, established, a, virtual, military, dictatorship, largely, ignoring, chancellor, emperor, and, reichstag, bismarck, was, a, conservative, or, white, revolutionary, he, taught, conservatives, to, be, nationalists, and, supporters, of, welfare, programs, thereby, enlarging, their, base, of, support, and, weakening, the, socialist, movement, after, working, closely, with, liberals, and, fighting, the, catholics, he, switched, and, added, the, conservative, catholics, to, his, base, while, opposing, the, liberals, however, henry, kissinger, notes, the, dangers, of, this, legacy, for, germany, in, the, 20th, century, he, so, thoroughly, undermined, liberalism, that, weimar, germany, never, could, make, liberalism, succeed, nationalism, unleavened, by, liberalism, turned, chauvinistic, and, liberalism, without, responsibility, grew, sterile, according, to, historian, norman, rich, nevertheless, the, success, of, bismarck, s, diplomacy, and, i, think, it, was, on, the, whole, successful, did, not, depend, on, any, system, but, on, his, qualities, as, a, diplomat, of, these, the, most, important, was, not, his, genius, but, his, attention, to, the, fundamentals, of, diplomacy, a, dispassionate, evaluation, of, national, interests, care, to, avoid, challenging, the, national, interests, of, other, great, powers, and, an, awareness, of, the, quality, of, national, power, and, its, limitations, it, was, the, neglect, of, these, fundamentals, which, more, than, anything, else, brought, disaster, to, his, successors, bismarck, s, psychology, and, personal, traits, have, not, been, so, favourably, received, by, scholars, the, historian, jonathan, steinberg, portrays, a, demonic, genius, who, was, deeply, vengeful, even, toward, his, closest, friends, and, family, members, began, to, see, bismarck, as, a, kind, of, malign, genius, who, behind, the, various, postures, concealed, an, ice, cold, contempt, for, his, fellow, human, beings, and, a, methodical, determination, to, control, and, ruin, them, his, easy, chat, combined, blunt, truths, partial, revelations, and, outright, deceptions, his, extraordinary, double, ability, to, see, how, groups, would, react, and, the, willingness, to, use, violence, to, make, them, obey, the, capacity, to, read, group, behavior, and, the, force, to, make, them, move, to, his, will, gave, him, the, chance, to, exercise, what, called, his, sovereign, self, evans, says, he, was, intimidating, and, unscrupulous, playing, to, others, frailties, not, their, strengths, british, historians, including, steinberg, evans, taylor, and, palmer, see, bismarck, as, an, ambivalent, figure, undoubtedly, a, man, of, great, skill, but, who, left, no, lasting, system, in, place, to, guide, successors, less, skilled, than, himself, being, a, committed, monarchist, himself, bismarck, allowed, no, effective, constitutional, check, on, the, power, of, the, emperor, thus, placing, a, time, bomb, in, the, foundation, of, the, germany, that, he, created, jonathan, steinberg, in, his, 2011, biography, of, bismarck, wrote, that, he, was, a, political, genius, of, a, very, unusual, kind, rested, on, several, sets, of, conflicting, characteristics, among, which, brutal, disarming, honesty, mingled, with, the, wiles, and, deceits, of, a, confidence, man, he, played, his, parts, with, perfect, self, confidence, yet, mixed, them, with, rage, anxiety, illness, hypochrondria, and, irrationality, he, used, democracy, when, it, suited, him, negotiated, with, revolutionaries, and, the, dangerous, ferdinand, lassalle, the, socialist, who, might, have, contested, his, authority, he, utterly, dominated, his, cabinet, ministers, with, a, sovereign, contempt, and, blackened, their, reputations, as, soon, as, he, no, longer, needed, them, he, outwitted, the, parliamentary, parties, even, the, strongest, of, them, and, betrayed, all, those, who, had, put, him, into, power, by, 1870, even, his, closest, friends, realized, that, they, had, helped, put, a, demonic, figure, into, power, during, most, of, his, nearly, thirty, year, long, tenure, bismarck, held, undisputed, control, over, the, government, s, policies, he, was, well, supported, by, his, friend, albrecht, von, roon, the, war, minister, as, well, as, the, leader, of, the, prussian, army, helmuth, von, moltke, bismarck, s, diplomatic, moves, relied, on, a, victorious, prussian, military, and, these, two, men, gave, bismarck, the, victories, he, needed, to, convince, the, smaller, german, states, to, join, prussia, bismarck, took, steps, to, silence, or, restrain, political, opposition, as, evidenced, by, laws, restricting, the, freedom, of, the, press, and, the, anti, socialist, laws, he, waged, a, culture, war, kulturkampf, against, the, catholic, church, he, was, losing, when, he, realized, the, conservatism, of, the, catholics, made, them, natural, allies, against, the, socialists, he, then, switched, positions, winning, catholic, centre, support, and, opposing, the, liberals, wilhelm, i, rarely, challenged, the, chancellor, s, decisions, on, several, occasions, bismarck, obtained, his, monarch, s, approval, by, threatening, to, resign, however, wilhelm, ii, intended, to, govern, the, country, himself, making, the, ousting, of, bismarck, one, of, his, first, tasks, as, kaiser, bismarck, s, successors, as, chancellor, were, much, less, influential, as, power, was, concentrated, in, the, emperor, s, hands, immediately, after, he, left, office, citizens, started, to, praise, him, and, established, funds, to, build, monuments, like, the, bismarck, memorial, or, towers, dedicated, to, him, throughout, germany, the, accolades, were, unending, several, buildings, were, named, in, his, honour, portraits, of, him, were, commissioned, from, artists, such, as, franz, von, lenbach, and, c, w, allers, and, books, about, him, became, best, sellers, the, first, monument, built, in, his, honour, was, the, one, at, bad, kissingen, erected, in, 1877, numerous, statues, and, memorials, dot, the, cities, towns, and, countryside, of, germany, including, the, famous, bismarck, memorial, in, berlin, and, numerous, bismarck, towers, on, four, continents, the, only, memorial, depicting, him, as, a, student, at, g, ttingen, university, together, with, a, dog, possibly, his, reichshund, tyras, and, as, a, member, of, his, corps, hannovera, was, re, erected, in, 2006, at, the, rudelsburg, the, gleaming, white, 1906, bismarck, monument, in, the, city, of, hamburg, stands, in, the, centre, of, the, st, pauli, district, and, is, the, largest, and, probably, best, known, memorial, to, bismarck, worldwide, the, statues, depicted, him, as, massive, monolithic, rigid, and, unambiguous, two, warships, were, named, in, his, honour, the, sms, bismarck, of, the, german, imperial, navy, and, the, bismarck, from, the, world, war, ii, era, bismarck, was, the, most, memorable, figure, in, germany, down, to, the, 1930s, the, dominant, memory, was, the, great, hero, of, the, 1860s, who, defeated, all, enemies, especially, france, and, unified, germany, to, become, the, most, powerful, military, and, diplomatic, force, in, the, world, of, course, there, were, no, monuments, celebrating, bismarck, s, devotion, to, the, cause, of, european, peace, after, 1871, but, there, were, other, german, memories, his, fellow, junkers, were, disappointed, as, prussia, after, 1871, became, swallowed, up, and, dominated, by, the, german, empire, liberal, intellectuals, few, in, number, but, dominant, in, the, universities, and, business, houses, celebrated, his, achievement, of, the, national, state, a, constitutional, monarchy, and, the, rule, of, law, and, forestalling, revolution, and, marginalizing, radicalism, social, democrats, and, labor, leaders, had, always, been, his, target, and, he, remained, their, b, te, noire, catholics, could, not, forget, the, kulturkampf, and, remained, distrustful, especially, negative, were, the, poles, who, hated, his, germanisation, programs, robert, gerwarth, shows, that, the, bismarck, myth, built, up, predominantly, during, his, years, of, retirement, and, even, more, stridently, after, his, death, proved, a, powerful, rhetorical, and, ideological, tool, the, myth, made, him, out, to, be, a, dogmatic, ideologue, and, ardent, nationalist, when, in, fact, he, was, ideologically, flexible, gerwarth, argues, that, the, constructed, memory, of, bismarck, played, a, central, role, as, an, antidemocratic, myth, in, the, highly, ideological, battle, over, the, past, which, raged, between, 1918, and, 1933, this, myth, proved, to, be, a, weapon, against, the, weimar, republic, and, exercised, a, destructive, influence, on, the, political, culture, of, the, first, german, democracy, frankel, in, bismarck, s, shadow, 2005, shows, the, bismarck, cult, fostered, and, legitimized, a, new, style, of, right, wing, politics, it, made, possible, the, post, bismarckian, crisis, of, leadership, both, real, and, perceived, that, had, germans, seeking, the, strongest, possible, leader, and, asking, what, would, bismarck, do, for, example, hamburg, s, memorial, unveiled, in, 1906, is, considered, one, of, the, greatest, expressions, of, imperial, germany, s, bismarck, cult, and, an, important, development, in, the, history, of, german, memorial, art, it, was, a, product, of, the, desire, of, hamburg, s, patrician, classes, to, defend, their, political, privileges, in, the, face, of, dramatic, social, change, and, attendant, demands, for, political, reform, to, those, who, presided, over, its, construction, the, monument, was, also, a, means, of, asserting, hamburg, s, cultural, aspirations, and, of, shrugging, off, a, reputation, as, a, city, hostile, to, the, arts, the, memorial, was, greeted, with, widespread, disapproval, among, the, working, classes, and, did, not, prevent, their, increasing, support, for, the, social, democrats, a, number, of, localities, around, the, world, have, been, named, in, bismarck, s, honour, they, include, bismarck, was, created, graf, von, bismarck, sch, nhausen, count, of, bismarck, sch, nhausen, in, 1865, and, f, rst, von, bismarck, prince, of, bismarck, in, 1871, in, 1890, he, was, granted, the, title, of, herzog, von, lauenburg, duke, of, lauenburg, the, duchy, was, one, of, the, territories, that, prussia, seized, from, the, king, of, denmark, in, 1864, it, was, bismarck, s, lifelong, ambition, to, be, assimilated, into, the, mediatized, houses, of, germany, he, attempted, to, persuade, kaiser, wilhelm, i, that, he, should, be, endowed, with, the, sovereign, duchy, of, saxe, lauenburg, in, reward, for, his, services, to, the, imperial, family, and, the, german, empire, this, was, on, the, understanding, that, bismarck, would, immediately, restore, the, duchy, to, prussia, all, he, wanted, was, the, status, and, privileges, of, a, mediatized, family, for, himself, and, his, descendants, this, novel, idea, was, rejected, by, the, conservative, emperor, who, thought, that, he, had, already, given, the, chancellor, enough, rewards, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, he, informed, wilhelm, ii, of, his, wishes, after, being, forced, by, the, sovereign, to, resign, he, received, the, purely, honorific, title, of, duke, of, lauenburg, without, the, duchy, itself, and, the, sovereignty, that, would, have, transformed, his, family, into, a, mediatized, house, bismarck, regarded, it, as, a, mockery, of, his, ambition, and, he, considered, nothing, crueler, than, this, action, of, the, emperor, domestic, orders, and, decorations, foreign, orders, and, decorations
