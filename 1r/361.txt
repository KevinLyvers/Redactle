la, com, die, humaine, which, presents, a, panorama, of, post, napoleonic, french, life, is, generally, viewed, as, his, magnum, opus, owing, to, his, keen, observation, of, detail, and, unfiltered, representation, of, society, balzac, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, realism, in, european, literature, he, is, renowned, for, his, multi, faceted, characters, even, his, lesser, characters, are, complex, morally, ambiguous, and, fully, human, inanimate, objects, are, imbued, with, character, as, well, the, city, of, paris, a, backdrop, for, much, of, his, writing, takes, on, many, human, qualities, his, writing, influenced, many, famous, writers, including, the, novelists, mile, zola, charles, dickens, marcel, proust, gustave, flaubert, and, henry, james, and, filmmakers, fran, ois, truffaut, and, jacques, rivette, many, of, balzac, s, works, have, been, made, into, films, and, continue, to, inspire, other, writers, james, called, him, really, the, father, of, us, all, an, enthusiastic, reader, and, independent, thinker, as, a, child, balzac, had, trouble, adapting, to, the, teaching, style, of, his, grammar, school, his, willful, nature, caused, trouble, throughout, his, life, and, frustrated, his, ambitions, to, succeed, in, the, world, of, business, when, he, finished, school, balzac, was, apprenticed, in, a, law, office, but, he, turned, his, back, on, the, study, of, law, after, wearying, of, its, inhumanity, and, banal, routine, before, and, during, his, career, as, a, writer, he, attempted, to, be, a, publisher, printer, businessman, critic, and, politician, he, failed, in, all, of, these, efforts, la, com, die, humaine, reflects, his, real, life, difficulties, and, includes, scenes, from, his, own, experience, balzac, suffered, from, health, problems, throughout, his, life, possibly, owing, to, his, intense, writing, schedule, his, relationship, with, his, family, was, often, strained, by, financial, and, personal, drama, and, he, lost, more, than, one, friend, over, critical, reviews, in, 1850, balzac, married, ewelina, ha, ska, n, e, contessa, rzewuska, a, polish, aristocrat, and, his, longtime, love, he, died, in, paris, six, months, later, honor, de, balzac, was, born, into, a, family, which, aspired, to, achieve, respectability, through, its, industry, and, efforts, his, father, born, bernard, fran, ois, balssa, was, one, of, eleven, children, from, an, artisan, family, in, tarn, a, region, in, the, south, of, france, in, 1760, he, set, off, for, paris, with, only, a, louis, coin, in, his, pocket, intent, on, improving, his, social, standing, by, 1776, he, had, become, secretary, to, the, king, s, council, and, a, freemason, he, had, also, changed, his, name, to, the, more, noble, sounding, balzac, his, son, later, adding, without, official, recognition, the, nobiliary, particle, de, after, the, reign, of, terror, 1793, 94, fran, ois, balzac, was, despatched, to, tours, to, coordinate, supplies, for, the, army, balzac, s, mother, born, anne, charlotte, laure, sallambier, came, from, a, family, of, haberdashers, in, paris, her, family, s, wealth, was, a, considerable, factor, in, the, match, she, was, eighteen, at, the, time, of, the, wedding, and, fran, ois, balzac, fifty, as, the, author, and, literary, critic, sir, victor, pritchett, explained, she, was, certainly, drily, aware, that, she, had, been, given, to, an, old, husband, as, a, reward, for, his, professional, services, to, a, friend, of, her, family, and, that, the, capital, was, on, her, side, she, was, not, in, love, with, her, husband, honor, named, after, saint, honor, of, amiens, who, is, commemorated, on, 16, may, four, days, before, balzac, s, birthday, was, actually, the, second, child, born, to, the, balzacs, exactly, one, year, earlier, louis, daniel, had, been, born, but, he, lived, for, only, a, month, honor, s, sisters, laure, and, laurence, were, born, in, 1800, and, 1802, and, his, younger, brother, henry, fran, ois, in, 1807, as, an, infant, balzac, was, sent, to, a, wet, nurse, the, following, year, he, was, joined, by, his, sister, laure, and, they, spent, four, years, away, from, home, although, genevan, philosopher, jean, jacques, rousseau, s, influential, book, mile, convinced, many, mothers, of, the, time, to, nurse, their, own, children, sending, babies, to, wet, nurses, was, still, common, among, the, middle, and, upper, classes, when, the, balzac, children, returned, home, they, were, kept, at, a, frosty, distance, from, their, parents, which, affected, the, author, to, be, significantly, his, 1835, novel, le, lys, dans, la, vall, e, features, a, cruel, governess, named, miss, caroline, modeled, after, his, own, caregiver, at, age, ten, balzac, was, sent, to, the, oratorian, grammar, school, in, vend, me, where, he, studied, for, seven, years, his, father, seeking, to, instill, the, same, hardscrabble, work, ethic, which, had, gained, him, the, esteem, of, society, intentionally, gave, little, spending, money, to, the, boy, this, made, him, the, object, of, ridicule, among, his, much, wealthier, schoolmates, balzac, had, difficulty, adapting, to, the, rote, style, of, learning, at, the, school, as, a, result, he, was, frequently, sent, to, the, alcove, a, punishment, cell, reserved, for, disobedient, students, the, janitor, at, the, school, when, asked, later, if, he, remembered, honor, replied, remember, m, balzac, i, should, think, i, do, i, had, the, honour, of, escorting, him, to, the, dungeon, more, than, a, hundred, times, still, his, time, alone, gave, the, boy, ample, freedom, to, read, every, book, which, came, his, way, balzac, worked, these, scenes, from, his, boyhood, as, he, did, many, aspects, of, his, life, and, the, lives, of, those, around, him, into, la, com, die, humaine, his, time, at, vend, me, is, reflected, in, louis, lambert, his, 1832, novel, about, a, young, boy, studying, at, an, oratorian, grammar, school, at, vend, me, the, narrator, says, he, devoured, books, of, every, kind, feeding, indiscriminately, on, religious, works, history, and, literature, philosophy, and, physics, he, had, told, me, that, he, found, indescribable, delight, in, reading, dictionaries, for, lack, of, other, books, balzac, often, fell, ill, finally, causing, the, headmaster, to, contact, his, family, with, news, of, a, sort, of, a, coma, when, he, returned, home, his, grandmother, said, voil, donc, comme, le, coll, ge, nous, renvoie, les, jolis, que, nous, lui, envoyons, look, how, the, academy, returns, the, pretty, ones, we, send, them, balzac, himself, attributed, his, condition, to, intellectual, congestion, but, his, extended, confinement, in, the, alcove, was, surely, a, factor, meanwhile, his, father, had, been, writing, a, treatise, on, the, means, of, preventing, thefts, and, murders, and, of, restoring, the, men, who, commit, them, to, a, useful, role, in, society, in, which, he, heaped, disdain, on, prison, as, a, form, of, crime, prevention, in, 1814, the, balzac, family, moved, to, paris, and, honor, was, sent, to, private, tutors, and, schools, for, the, next, two, and, a, half, years, this, was, an, unhappy, time, in, his, life, during, which, he, attempted, suicide, on, a, bridge, over, the, river, loire, in, 1816, balzac, entered, the, sorbonne, where, he, studied, under, three, famous, professors, fran, ois, guizot, who, later, became, prime, minister, was, professor, of, modern, history, abel, fran, ois, villemain, a, recent, arrival, from, the, coll, ge, charlemagne, lectured, on, french, and, classical, literature, and, most, influential, of, all, victor, cousin, s, courses, on, philosophy, encouraged, his, students, to, think, independently, once, his, studies, were, completed, balzac, was, persuaded, by, his, father, to, follow, him, into, the, law, after, a, stint, in, the, office, of, the, avou, jean, baptiste, guillonnet, merville, for, three, years, he, trained, and, worked, at, the, office, of, the, notary, douard, victor, passez, a, family, friend, during, this, time, balzac, began, to, understand, the, vagaries, of, human, nature, in, his, 1840, novel, le, notaire, he, wrote, that, a, young, person, in, the, legal, profession, sees, the, oily, wheels, of, every, fortune, the, hideous, wrangling, of, heirs, over, corpses, not, yet, cold, the, human, heart, grappling, with, the, penal, code, in, 1819, passez, offered, to, make, balzac, his, successor, but, his, apprentice, had, had, enough, of, the, law, he, despaired, of, being, a, clerk, a, machine, a, riding, school, hack, eating, and, drinking, and, sleeping, at, fixed, hours, i, should, be, like, everyone, else, and, that, s, what, they, call, living, that, life, at, the, grindstone, doing, the, same, thing, over, and, over, again, i, am, hungry, and, nothing, is, offered, to, appease, my, appetite, he, announced, his, intention, to, become, a, writer, the, loss, of, this, opportunity, caused, serious, discord, in, the, balzac, household, although, honor, was, not, turned, away, entirely, instead, in, april, 1819, he, was, allowed, to, live, in, the, french, capital, as, english, critic, george, saintsbury, describes, it, in, a, garret, furnished, in, the, most, spartan, fashion, with, a, starvation, allowance, and, an, old, woman, to, look, after, him, while, the, rest, of, the, family, moved, to, a, house, twenty, miles, outside, paris, balzac, s, first, project, was, a, libretto, for, a, comic, opera, called, le, corsaire, based, on, lord, byron, s, the, corsair, realizing, he, would, have, trouble, finding, a, composer, however, he, turned, to, other, pursuits, in, 1820, balzac, completed, the, five, act, verse, tragedy, cromwell, although, it, pales, by, comparison, with, his, later, works, some, critics, consider, it, a, good, quality, text, when, he, finished, balzac, went, to, villeparisis, and, read, the, entire, work, to, his, family, they, were, unimpressed, he, followed, this, effort, by, starting, but, never, finishing, three, novels, st, nie, falthurne, and, corsino, in, 1821, balzac, met, the, enterprising, auguste, le, poitevin, who, convinced, the, author, to, write, short, stories, which, le, poitevin, would, then, sell, to, publishers, balzac, quickly, turned, to, longer, works, and, by, 1826, he, had, written, nine, novels, all, published, under, pseudonyms, and, often, produced, in, collaboration, with, other, writers, for, example, the, scandalous, novel, vicaire, des, ardennes, 1822, banned, for, its, depiction, of, nearly, incestuous, relations, and, more, egregiously, of, a, married, priest, attributed, to, a, horace, de, saint, aubin, these, books, were, potboiler, novels, designed, to, sell, quickly, and, titillate, audiences, in, saintsbury, s, view, they, are, curiously, interestingly, almost, enthrallingly, bad, saintsbury, indicates, that, robert, louis, stevenson, tried, to, dissuade, him, from, reading, these, early, works, of, balzac, american, critic, samuel, rogers, however, notes, that, without, the, training, they, gave, balzac, as, he, groped, his, way, to, his, mature, conception, of, the, novel, and, without, the, habit, he, formed, as, a, young, man, of, writing, under, pressure, one, can, hardly, imagine, his, producing, la, com, die, humaine, biographer, graham, robb, suggests, that, as, he, discovered, the, novel, balzac, discovered, himself, during, this, time, balzac, wrote, two, pamphlets, in, support, of, primogeniture, and, the, society, of, jesus, the, latter, regarding, the, jesuits, illustrated, his, lifelong, admiration, for, the, catholic, church, in, the, preface, to, la, com, die, humaine, he, wrote, christianity, above, all, catholicism, being, a, complete, system, for, the, repression, of, the, depraved, tendencies, of, man, is, the, most, powerful, element, of, social, order, in, the, late, 1820s, balzac, dabbled, in, several, business, ventures, a, penchant, his, sister, blamed, on, the, temptation, of, an, unknown, neighbour, his, first, enterprise, was, in, publishing, which, turned, out, cheap, one, volume, editions, of, french, classics, including, the, works, of, moli, re, this, business, failed, miserably, with, many, of, the, books, sold, as, waste, paper, balzac, had, better, luck, publishing, the, memoirs, of, the, duchess, of, abrant, s, with, whom, he, also, had, a, love, affair, balzac, borrowed, money, from, his, family, and, friends, and, tried, to, build, a, printing, business, then, a, type, foundry, his, inexperience, and, lack, of, capital, caused, his, ruin, in, these, trades, he, gave, the, businesses, to, a, friend, who, made, them, successful, but, carried, the, debts, for, many, years, as, of, april, 1828, balzac, owed, 50, 000, francs, to, his, mother, balzac, never, lost, his, penchant, for, une, bonne, sp, culation, it, resurfaced, painfully, later, when, as, a, renowned, and, busy, author, he, traveled, to, sardinia, in, the, hopes, of, reprocessing, the, slag, from, the, roman, mines, there, near, the, end, of, his, life, balzac, was, captivated, by, the, idea, of, cutting, 20, 000, acres, 81, km, 2, of, oak, wood, in, ukraine, and, transporting, it, for, sale, in, france, after, writing, several, novels, in, 1832, balzac, conceived, the, idea, for, an, enormous, series, of, books, that, would, paint, a, panoramic, portrait, of, all, aspects, of, society, the, moment, the, idea, came, to, him, balzac, raced, to, his, sister, s, apartment, and, proclaimed, i, am, about, to, become, a, genius, although, he, originally, called, it, etudes, des, m, urs, literally, studies, of, manners, or, the, ways, of, the, world, it, eventually, became, known, as, la, com, die, humaine, and, he, included, in, it, all, the, fiction, that, he, had, published, in, his, lifetime, under, his, own, name, this, was, to, be, balzac, s, life, work, and, his, greatest, achievement, after, the, collapse, of, his, businesses, balzac, traveled, to, brittany, and, stayed, with, the, de, pommereul, family, outside, foug, res, there, he, drew, inspiration, for, les, chouans, 1829, a, tale, of, love, gone, wrong, amid, the, chouan, royalist, forces, although, he, was, a, supporter, of, the, crown, balzac, paints, the, revolutionaries, in, a, sympathetic, light, even, though, they, are, the, center, of, the, book, s, most, brutal, scenes, this, was, the, first, book, balzac, released, under, his, own, name, and, it, gave, him, what, one, critic, called, passage, into, the, promised, land, it, established, him, as, an, author, of, note, even, if, its, historical, fiction, genre, imitates, that, of, sir, walter, scott, and, provided, him, with, a, name, outside, his, past, pseudonyms, soon, afterwards, around, the, time, of, his, father, s, death, balzac, wrote, el, verdugo, about, a, 30, year, old, man, who, kills, his, father, balzac, was, 30, years, old, at, the, time, this, was, the, first, work, signed, honor, de, balzac, he, followed, his, father, in, the, surname, balzac, but, added, the, aristocratic, sounding, nobiliary, particle, to, help, him, fit, into, respected, society, a, choice, based, on, skill, rather, than, by, right, the, aristocracy, and, authority, of, talent, are, more, substantial, than, the, aristocracy, of, names, and, material, power, he, wrote, in, 1830, the, timing, of, the, decision, was, also, significant, as, robb, explained, the, disappearance, of, the, father, coincides, with, the, adoption, of, the, nobiliary, particle, a, symbolic, inheritance, just, as, his, father, had, worked, his, way, up, from, poverty, into, respectable, society, balzac, considered, toil, and, effort, his, real, mark, of, nobility, when, the, july, revolution, overthrew, charles, x, in, 1830, balzac, declared, himself, a, legitimist, supporting, king, charles, royal, house, of, bourbon, but, not, without, qualifications, he, felt, that, the, new, july, monarchy, which, claimed, widespread, popular, support, was, disorganized, and, unprincipled, in, need, of, a, mediator, to, keep, the, political, peace, between, the, king, and, insurgent, forces, he, called, for, a, young, and, vigorous, man, who, belongs, neither, to, the, directoire, nor, to, the, empire, but, who, is, 1830, incarnate, he, planned, to, be, such, a, candidate, appealing, especially, to, the, higher, classes, in, chinon, but, after, a, near, fatal, accident, in, 1832, he, slipped, and, cracked, his, head, on, the, street, balzac, decided, not, to, stand, for, election, 1831, saw, the, success, of, la, peau, de, chagrin, the, wild, ass, s, skin, or, the, magic, skin, a, fable, like, tale, about, a, despondent, young, man, named, rapha, l, de, valentin, who, finds, an, animal, skin, which, promises, great, power, and, wealth, he, obtains, these, things, but, loses, the, ability, to, manage, them, in, the, end, his, health, fails, and, he, is, consumed, by, his, own, confusion, balzac, meant, the, story, to, bear, witness, to, the, treacherous, turns, of, life, its, serpentine, motion, in, 1833, balzac, released, eug, nie, grandet, his, first, best, seller, the, tale, of, a, young, lady, who, inherits, her, father, s, miserliness, it, also, became, the, most, critically, acclaimed, book, of, his, career, the, writing, is, simple, yet, the, individuals, especially, the, bourgeois, title, character, are, dynamic, and, complex, it, is, followed, by, la, duchesse, de, langeais, arguably, the, most, sublime, of, his, novels, le, p, re, goriot, old, father, goriot, 1835, was, his, next, success, in, which, balzac, transposes, the, story, of, king, lear, to, 1820s, paris, in, order, to, rage, at, a, society, bereft, of, all, love, save, the, love, of, money, the, centrality, of, a, father, in, this, novel, matches, balzac, s, own, position, not, only, as, mentor, to, his, troubled, young, secretary, jules, sandeau, but, also, the, fact, that, he, had, fathered, a, child, marie, caroline, du, fresnay, with, his, otherwise, married, lover, maria, du, fresnay, who, had, been, his, source, of, inspiration, for, eug, nie, grandet, in, 1836, balzac, took, the, helm, of, the, chronique, de, paris, a, weekly, magazine, of, society, and, politics, he, tried, to, enforce, strict, impartiality, in, its, pages, and, a, reasoned, assessment, of, various, ideologies, as, rogers, notes, balzac, was, interested, in, any, social, political, or, economic, theory, whether, from, the, right, or, the, left, the, magazine, failed, but, in, july, 1840, he, founded, another, publication, the, revue, parisienne, it, produced, three, issues, these, dismal, business, efforts, and, his, misadventures, in, sardinia, provided, an, appropriate, milieu, in, which, to, set, the, two, volume, illusions, perdues, lost, illusions, 1843, the, novel, concerns, lucien, de, rubempr, a, young, poet, trying, to, make, a, name, for, himself, who, becomes, trapped, in, the, morass, of, society, s, darkest, contradictions, lucien, s, journalistic, work, is, informed, by, balzac, s, own, failed, ventures, in, the, field, splendeurs, et, mis, res, des, courtisanes, the, harlot, high, and, low, 1847, continues, lucien, s, story, he, is, trapped, by, the, abb, herrera, vautrin, in, a, convoluted, and, disastrous, plan, to, regain, social, status, the, book, undergoes, a, massive, temporal, rift, the, first, part, of, four, covers, a, span, of, six, years, while, the, final, two, sections, focus, on, just, three, days, le, cousin, pons, 1847, and, la, cousine, bette, 1848, tell, the, story, of, les, parents, pauvres, the, poor, relations, the, conniving, and, wrangling, over, wills, and, inheritances, reflect, the, expertise, gained, by, the, author, as, a, young, law, clerk, balzac, s, health, was, deteriorating, by, this, point, making, the, completion, of, this, pair, of, books, a, significant, accomplishment, many, of, his, novels, were, initially, serialized, like, those, of, dickens, their, length, was, not, predetermined, illusions, perdues, extends, to, a, thousand, pages, after, starting, inauspiciously, in, a, small, town, print, shop, whereas, la, fille, aux, yeux, d, or, the, girl, with, the, golden, eyes, 1835, opens, with, a, broad, panorama, of, paris, but, becomes, a, closely, plotted, novella, of, only, fifty, pages, according, to, the, literary, critic, kornelije, kvas, balzac, s, use, of, the, same, characters, rastignac, vautrin, in, different, parts, of, the, human, comedy, is, a, consequence, of, the, realist, striving, for, narrative, economy, balzac, s, work, habits, were, legendary, he, wrote, from, 1, a, m, to, 8, a, m, every, morning, and, sometimes, even, longer, balzac, could, write, very, rapidly, some, of, his, novels, written, with, a, quill, were, composed, at, a, pace, equal, to, thirty, words, per, minute, on, a, modern, typewriter, his, preferred, method, was, to, eat, a, light, meal, at, five, or, six, in, the, afternoon, then, sleep, until, midnight, he, then, rose, and, wrote, for, many, hours, fueled, by, innumerable, cups, of, black, coffee, he, often, worked, for, fifteen, hours, or, more, at, a, stretch, he, claimed, to, have, once, worked, for, 48, hours, with, only, three, hours, of, rest, in, the, middle, balzac, revised, obsessively, covering, printer, s, proofs, with, changes, and, additions, to, be, reset, he, sometimes, repeated, this, process, during, the, publication, of, a, book, causing, significant, expense, both, for, himself, and, the, publisher, as, a, result, the, finished, product, quite, often, was, different, from, the, original, text, although, some, of, his, books, never, reached, completion, some, such, as, les, employ, s, the, government, clerks, 1841, are, nonetheless, noted, by, critics, although, balzac, was, by, turns, a, hermit, and, a, vagrant, he, managed, to, stay, in, tune, with, the, social, spheres, which, nourished, his, writing, he, was, friends, with, th, ophile, gautier, and, pierre, marie, charles, de, bernard, du, grail, de, la, villette, and, he, was, acquainted, with, victor, hugo, nevertheless, he, did, not, spend, as, much, time, in, salons, and, clubs, of, paris, like, many, of, his, characters, in, the, first, place, he, was, too, busy, explains, saintsbury, in, the, second, he, would, not, have, been, at, home, there, e, felt, it, was, his, business, not, to, frequent, society, but, to, create, it, however, he, often, spent, long, periods, at, the, ch, teau, de, sach, near, tours, the, home, of, his, friend, jean, de, margonne, his, mother, s, lover, and, father, to, her, youngest, child, many, of, balzac, s, tormented, characters, were, conceived, in, the, chateau, s, small, second, floor, bedroom, today, the, chateau, is, a, museum, dedicated, to, the, author, s, life, in, 1833, as, he, revealed, in, a, letter, to, his, sister, balzac, entered, into, an, illicit, affair, with, fellow, writer, maria, du, fresnay, who, was, then, aged, 24, her, marriage, to, a, considerably, older, man, charles, du, fresnay, mayor, of, sartrouville, had, been, a, failure, from, the, outset, in, this, letter, balzac, also, reveals, that, the, young, woman, had, just, come, to, tell, him, she, was, pregnant, with, his, child, in, 1834, 8, months, after, the, event, maria, du, fresnay, s, daughter, by, balzac, marie, caroline, du, fresnay, was, born, this, revelation, from, french, journalist, roger, pierrot, in, 1955, confirmed, what, was, already, suspected, by, several, historians, the, dedicatee, of, the, novel, eug, nie, grandet, a, certain, maria, turns, out, to, be, maria, du, fresnay, herself, balzac, had, also, long, been, suspected, of, being, attracted, to, males, as, well, when, the, official, records, of, homosexuals, once, maintained, by, the, paris, police, were, finally, released, his, name, was, found, listed, in, february, 1832, balzac, received, an, intriguing, letter, from, odessa, with, no, return, address, and,

gone, to, bed, he, had, been, visited, that, day, by, victor, hugo, who, later, served, as, a, pallbearer, and, the, eulogist, at, balzac, s, funeral, some, modern, researchers, have, attributed, a, factor, in, his, death, to, excessive, coffee, consumption, or, a, caffeine, overdose, balzac, reportedly, drank, over, 50, cups, a, day, but, this, has, yet, to, be, proved, balzac, is, buried, at, p, re, lachaise, cemetery, in, paris, at, his, memorial, service, victor, hugo, pronounced, today, we, have, people, in, black, because, of, the, death, of, the, man, of, talent, a, nation, in, mourning, for, a, man, of, genius, the, funeral, was, attended, by, almost, every, writer, in, paris, including, fr, d, rick, lema, tre, gustave, courbet, dumas, p, re, and, dumas, fils, as, well, as, representatives, of, the, l, gion, d, honneur, and, other, dignitaries, later, a, statue, called, the, monument, to, balzac, was, created, by, the, celebrated, french, sculptor, auguste, rodin, cast, in, bronze, the, balzac, monument, has, stood, since, 1939, nearby, the, intersection, of, boulevard, raspail, and, boulevard, montparnasse, at, place, pablo, picasso, rodin, featured, balzac, in, several, of, his, smaller, sculptures, as, well, the, com, die, humaine, remained, unfinished, at, the, time, of, his, death, balzac, had, plans, to, include, numerous, other, books, most, of, which, he, never, started, he, frequently, flitted, between, works, in, progress, finished, articles, were, frequently, revised, between, editions, this, piecemeal, style, is, reflective, of, the, author, s, own, life, a, possible, attempt, to, stabilize, it, through, fiction, the, vanishing, man, wrote, sir, victor, pritchett, who, must, be, pursued, from, the, rue, cassini, to, versailles, ville, d, avray, italy, and, vienna, can, construct, a, settled, dwelling, only, in, his, work, balzac, s, extensive, use, of, detail, especially, the, detail, of, objects, to, illustrate, the, lives, of, his, characters, made, him, an, early, pioneer, of, literary, realism, while, he, admired, and, drew, inspiration, from, the, romantic, style, of, scottish, novelist, walter, scott, balzac, sought, to, depict, human, existence, through, the, use, of, particulars, in, the, preface, to, the, first, edition, of, sc, nes, de, la, vie, priv, e, he, wrote, the, author, firmly, believes, that, details, alone, will, henceforth, determine, the, merit, of, works, plentiful, descriptions, of, d, cor, clothing, and, possessions, help, breathe, life, into, the, characters, for, example, balzac, s, friend, henri, de, latouche, had, a, good, knowledge, of, hanging, wallpaper, balzac, transferred, this, to, his, descriptions, of, the, pension, vauquer, in, le, p, re, goriot, making, the, wallpaper, speak, of, the, identities, of, those, living, inside, some, critics, consider, balzac, s, writing, exemplary, of, naturalism, a, more, pessimistic, and, analytical, form, of, realism, which, seeks, to, explain, human, behavior, as, intrinsically, linked, with, the, environment, french, novelist, mile, zola, declared, balzac, the, father, of, the, naturalist, novel, zola, indicated, that, whilst, the, romantics, saw, the, world, through, a, colored, lens, the, naturalist, sees, through, a, clear, glass, precisely, the, sort, of, effect, balzac, attempted, to, achieve, in, his, works, balzac, sought, to, present, his, characters, as, real, people, neither, fully, good, nor, fully, evil, but, completely, human, to, arrive, at, the, truth, he, wrote, in, the, preface, to, le, lys, dans, la, vall, e, writers, use, whatever, literary, device, seems, capable, of, giving, the, greatest, intensity, of, life, to, their, characters, balzac, s, characters, robb, notes, were, as, real, to, him, as, if, he, were, observing, them, in, the, outside, world, this, reality, was, noted, by, playwright, oscar, wilde, who, said, one, of, the, greatest, tragedies, of, my, life, is, the, death, of, lucien, de, rubempr, it, haunts, me, in, my, moments, of, pleasure, i, remember, it, when, i, laugh, at, the, same, time, the, characters, depict, a, particular, range, of, social, types, the, noble, soldier, the, scoundrel, the, proud, workman, the, fearless, spy, the, alluring, mistress, that, balzac, was, able, to, balance, the, strength, of, the, individual, against, the, representation, of, the, type, is, evidence, of, the, author, s, skill, one, critic, explained, that, there, is, a, center, and, a, circumference, to, balzac, s, world, balzac, s, use, of, repeat, characters, moving, in, and, out, of, the, com, die, s, books, strengthens, the, realist, representation, when, the, characters, reappear, notes, rogers, they, do, not, step, out, of, nowhere, they, emerge, from, the, privacy, of, their, own, lives, which, for, an, interval, we, have, not, been, allowed, to, see, he, also, used, a, realist, technique, which, french, novelist, marcel, proust, later, termed, retrospective, illumination, whereby, a, character, s, past, is, revealed, long, after, she, or, he, first, appears, a, nearly, infinite, reserve, of, energy, propels, the, characters, in, balzac, s, novels, struggling, against, the, currents, of, human, nature, and, society, they, may, lose, more, often, than, they, win, but, only, rarely, do, they, give, up, this, universal, trait, is, a, reflection, of, balzac, s, own, social, wrangling, that, of, his, family, and, an, interest, in, the, austrian, mystic, and, physician, franz, mesmer, who, pioneered, the, study, of, animal, magnetism, balzac, spoke, often, of, a, nervous, and, fluid, force, between, individuals, and, rapha, l, de, valentin, s, decline, in, la, peau, de, chagrin, exemplifies, the, danger, of, withdrawing, from, other, people, s, company, representations, of, the, city, countryside, and, building, interiors, are, essential, to, balzac, s, realism, often, serving, to, paint, a, naturalistic, backdrop, before, which, the, characters, lives, follow, a, particular, course, this, gave, him, a, reputation, as, an, early, naturalist, intricate, details, about, locations, sometimes, stretch, for, fifteen, or, twenty, pages, as, he, did, with, the, people, around, him, balzac, studied, these, places, in, depth, traveling, to, remote, locations, and, comparing, notes, that, he, had, made, on, previous, visits, the, influence, of, paris, permeates, la, com, die, nature, defers, to, the, artificial, metropolis, in, contrast, to, descriptions, of, the, weather, and, wildlife, in, the, countryside, if, in, paris, rogers, says, we, are, in, a, man, made, region, where, even, the, seasons, are, forgotten, these, provincial, towns, are, nearly, always, pictured, in, their, natural, setting, balzac, said, the, streets, of, paris, possess, human, qualities, and, we, cannot, shake, off, the, impressions, they, make, upon, our, minds, his, labyrinthine, city, provided, a, literary, model, used, later, by, english, novelist, charles, dickens, and, russian, author, fyodor, dostoevsky, the, centrality, of, paris, in, la, com, die, humaine, is, key, to, balzac, s, legacy, as, a, realist, realism, is, nothing, if, not, urban, notes, critic, peter, brooks, the, scene, of, a, young, man, coming, into, the, city, to, find, his, fortune, is, ubiquitous, in, the, realist, novel, and, appears, repeatedly, in, balzac, s, works, such, as, illusions, perdues, balzac, visited, the, ch, teau, de, sach, in, touraine, which, was, owned, by, his, friend, jean, de, margonne, who, was, also, his, mother, s, lover, between, 1830, and, 1837, and, wrote, many, of, his, novels, in, the, series, la, comedie, humaine, there, it, is, now, a, museum, dedicated, to, balzac, where, one, can, see, his, writing, desk, and, quill, pen, and, chair, balzac, s, literary, mood, evolved, over, time, from, one, of, despondency, and, chagrin, to, that, of, solidarity, and, courage, but, not, optimism, la, peau, de, chagrin, among, his, earliest, novels, is, a, pessimistic, tale, of, confusion, and, destruction, but, the, cynicism, declined, as, his, oeuvre, developed, and, the, characters, of, illusions, perdues, reveal, sympathy, for, those, who, are, pushed, to, one, side, by, society, as, part, of, the, 19th, century, evolution, of, the, novel, as, a, democratic, literary, form, balzac, wrote, that, les, livres, sont, faits, pour, tout, le, monde, books, are, written, for, everybody, balzac, concerned, himself, overwhelmingly, with, the, darker, essence, of, human, nature, and, the, corrupting, influence, of, middle, and, high, societies, his, mission, was, to, observe, humankind, in, its, most, representative, state, frequently, wandering, through, the, streets, incognito, among, the, masses, of, parisian, society, to, undertake, his, research, he, used, incidents, from, his, life, and, the, people, around, him, in, works, like, eug, nie, grandet, and, louis, lambert, balzac, was, a, legitimist, in, many, ways, his, views, are, the, antithesis, of, victor, hugo, s, democratic, republicanism, he, wrote, in, his, essay, society, and, the, individual, the, only, absolute, authority, which, the, imagination, has, been, able, to, conceive, the, authority, of, god, works, according, to, rules, which, he, has, imposed, on, himself, he, can, destroy, all, his, worlds, and, return, to, his, rest, but, while, he, allows, them, to, exist, they, continue, to, be, governed, by, the, laws, which, together, create, order, balzac, was, influenced, by, the, counter, revolutionary, philosopher, and, statesman, louis, de, bonald, and, once, remarked, that, hen, it, beheaded, louis, xvi, the, revolution, beheaded, in, his, person, all, fathers, of, families, nevertheless, his, keen, insight, regarding, working, class, conditions, earned, him, the, esteem, of, many, socialists, including, marxists, engels, declared, that, balzac, was, his, favorite, writer, marx, s, das, kapital, also, makes, some, references, to, the, works, of, balzac, and, trotsky, famously, read, balzac, in, the, middle, of, meetings, of, the, central, committee, much, to, the, consternation, of, his, colleagues, and, comrades, balzac, influenced, writers, of, his, time, and, beyond, he, has, been, compared, to, charles, dickens, and, is, considered, one, of, dickens, significant, influences, literary, critic, w, h, helm, calls, one, the, french, dickens, and, the, other, the, english, balzac, while, another, critic, richard, lehan, states, that, balzac, was, the, bridge, between, the, comic, realism, of, dickens, and, the, naturalism, of, zola, gustave, flaubert, was, also, substantially, influenced, by, balzac, praising, his, portrayal, of, society, while, attacking, his, prose, style, flaubert, once, wrote, what, a, man, he, would, have, been, had, he, known, how, to, write, while, he, disdained, the, label, of, realist, flaubert, clearly, took, heed, of, balzac, s, close, attention, to, detail, and, unvarnished, depictions, of, bourgeois, life, this, influence, shows, in, flaubert, s, work, l, ducation, sentimentale, which, owes, a, debt, to, balzac, s, illusions, perdues, what, balzac, started, observes, lehan, flaubert, helped, finish, marcel, proust, similarly, learned, from, the, realist, example, he, adored, balzac, and, studied, his, works, carefully, although, he, criticised, what, he, perceived, as, balzac, s, vulgarity, balzac, s, story, une, heure, de, ma, vie, an, hour, of, my, life, 1822, in, which, minute, details, are, followed, by, deep, personal, reflections, is, a, clear, forebear, of, the, style, which, proust, used, in, la, recherche, du, temps, perdu, however, proust, wrote, later, in, life, that, the, contemporary, fashion, of, ranking, balzac, higher, than, tolstoy, was, madness, perhaps, the, author, most, affected, by, balzac, was, american, expatriate, novelist, henry, james, in, 1878, james, wrote, with, sadness, about, the, lack, of, contemporary, attention, paid, to, balzac, and, lavished, praise, on, him, in, four, essays, in, 1875, 1877, 1902, and, 1913, in, 1878, james, wrote, large, as, balzac, is, he, is, all, of, one, piece, and, he, hangs, perfectly, together, he, wrote, with, admiration, of, balzac, s, attempt, to, portray, in, writing, a, beast, with, a, hundred, claws, in, his, own, novels, james, explored, more, of, the, psychological, motives, of, the, characters, and, less, of, the, historical, sweep, exhibited, by, balzac, a, conscious, style, preference, he, stated, the, artist, of, the, com, die, humaine, is, half, smothered, by, the, historian, still, both, authors, used, the, form, of, the, realist, novel, to, probe, the, machinations, of, society, and, the, myriad, motives, of, human, behavior, william, saroyan, wrote, a, short, story, about, balzac, in, his, 1971, book, letters, from, 74, rue, taitbout, or, don, t, go, but, if, you, must, say, hello, to, everybody, balzac, s, vision, of, a, society, in, which, class, money, and, personal, ambition, are, the, key, players, has, been, endorsed, by, critics, of, both, left, wing, and, right, wing, political, persuasions, marxist, friedrich, engels, wrote, i, have, learned, more, than, from, all, the, professional, historians, economists, and, statisticians, put, together, balzac, has,
