was, quoted, by, rambhadracharya, during, the, proceedings, of, the, ayodhya, dispute, in, the, allahabad, high, court, that, influenced, its, judgment, in, 2010, the, philosophy, and, principles, of, tulsidas, are, found, across, his, works, and, are, especially, outlined, in, the, dialogue, between, kakbhushundi, and, garuda, in, the, uttar, kand, of, the, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, doctrine, has, been, described, as, an, assimilation, and, reconciliation, of, the, diverse, tenets, and, cultures, of, hinduism, at, the, beginning, of, the, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, says, that, his, work, is, in, accordance, with, various, scriptures, the, puranas, vedas, upavedas, tantra, and, smriti, ram, chandra, shukla, in, his, critical, work, hindi, sahitya, ka, itihaas, elaborates, on, tulsidas, lokmangal, as, the, doctrine, for, social, upliftment, which, made, this, great, poet, immortal, and, comparable, to, any, other, world, litt, rateur, as, per, tulsidas, the, nirguna, brahman, quality, less, impersonal, absolute, and, saguna, brahman, personal, god, with, qualities, are, one, and, the, same, both, saguna, qualified, brahman, and, aguna, or, nirguna, unqualified, brahman, are, akath, unspeakable, agaadh, unfathomable, anaadi, without, beginning, in, existence, since, eternity, and, anupa, without, parallel, it, is, the, devotion, bhakti, of, the, devotee, that, forces, the, nirguna, brahman, which, is, quality, less, formless, invisible, and, unborn, to, become, saguna, brahman, with, qualities, tulsidas, gives, the, example, of, water, snow, and, hail, to, explain, this, the, substance, is, the, same, in, all, three, but, the, same, formless, water, solidifies, to, become, hail, or, a, mountain, of, snow, both, of, which, have, a, form, tulsidas, also, gives, the, simile, of, a, lake, the, nirguna, brahman, is, like, the, lake, with, just, water, while, the, saguna, brahman, is, a, lake, resplendent, with, blooming, lotuses, in, the, uttar, kand, of, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, describes, in, detail, a, debate, between, kakbhushundi, and, lomasa, about, whether, god, is, nirguna, as, argued, by, lomasa, adhering, to, monism, or, saguna, as, argued, by, kakbhushundi, adhering, to, dualism, kakbhushundi, repeatedly, refutes, all, the, arguments, of, lomasa, to, the, point, when, lomasa, becomes, angry, and, curses, kakbhushundi, to, be, a, crow, lomasa, repents, later, when, kakbhushundi, happily, accepts, the, curse, but, refuses, to, give, up, the, bhakti, of, rama, the, saguna, brahman, though, tulsidas, holds, both, aspects, of, god, to, be, equal, he, favours, the, qualified, saguna, aspect, and, the, devotees, of, the, highest, category, in, the, ramcharitmanas, repeatedly, ask, for, the, qualified, saguna, aspect, of, rama, to, dwell, in, their, mind, some, authors, contend, from, a, few, couplets, in, ramcharitmanas, and, vinay, patrika, that, tulsidas, has, vigorously, contradicted, the, denial, of, avatar, by, kabir, in, several, of, his, works, kabir, had, said, that, the, actual, rama, is, not, the, son, of, dasharatha, in, the, balkand, of, ramcharitmanas, shiva, tells, parvati, those, who, say, that, the, rama, whom, the, vedas, sing, of, and, whom, the, sages, contemplate, on, is, different, from, the, rama, of, raghu, s, race, are, possessed, by, the, devil, of, delusion, and, do, not, know, the, difference, between, truth, and, falsehood, however, such, allusions, are, based, on, interpretations, of, the, text, and, do, not, hold, much, water, when, considered, in, the, context, of, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, in, none, of, his, works, has, ever, mentioned, kabir, at, the, beginning, of, the, ramcharitmanas, there, is, a, section, devoted, to, the, veneration, of, the, name, of, rama, as, per, tulsidas, repeating, the, name, of, rama, is, the, only, means, to, attain, god, in, the, kali, age, where, the, means, suited, for, other, ages, like, meditation, karma, and, puja, are, ineffective, he, says, in, kavitavali, that, his, own, redemption, is, because, of, the, power, glory, and, majesty, of, the, name, of, rama, in, a, couplet, in, the, gitavali, tulsidas, says, that, wishing, for, liberation, without, refuge, in, the, name, of, rama, is, like, wishing, to, climb, to, the, sky, by, holding, on, to, the, falling, rain, in, his, view, the, name, of, rama, is, greater, than, both, nirguna, and, saguna, aspects, of, god, it, controls, both, of, them, and, is, illuminates, both, like, a, bilingual, interpreter, in, a, verse, in, the, dohavali, tulsidas, says, that, the, nirguna, brahman, resides, in, his, heart, the, saguna, brahman, resides, in, his, eyes, and, the, name, of, rama, resides, on, his, tongue, as, if, a, radiant, gemstone, is, kept, between, the, lower, and, upper, halves, of, a, golden, casket, he, holds, that, rama, is, superior, to, all, other, names, of, god, and, argues, that, ra, and, ma, being, are, the, only, two, consonants, that, are, written, above, all, other, consonants, in, the, conjunct, form, in, sanskrit, because, they, are, the, two, sounds, in, the, word, rama, at, several, places, in, tulsidas, works, rama, is, seen, to, be, the, higher, than, vishnu, and, not, as, an, avatar, of, vishnu, which, is, the, general, portrayal, of, rama, in, the, episode, of, the, delusion, of, sati, in, ramcharitmanas, sati, sees, many, a, shiva, brahma, and, vishnu, serving, rama, and, bowing, at, his, feet, when, manu, and, shatarupa, perform, penance, they, crave, to, see, that, supreme, lord, from, a, part, of, whose, being, emanate, a, number, of, shivas, brahmas, and, vishnus, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, come, to, them, many, times, tempting, them, with, a, boon, but, manu, and, shatarupa, do, not, stop, their, penance, they, are, finally, satisfied, only, by, the, appearance, of, rama, on, whose, left, side, is, sita, from, a, part, of, whom, are, born, countless, lakshmis, umas, parvatis, and, brahmanis, sarasvatis, in, the, episode, of, marriage, of, sita, and, rama, in, balkand, the, trio, of, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, is, present, brahma, is, astounded, as, he, finds, nowhere, anything, that, is, his, own, handiwork, while, vishnu, is, enchanted, with, lakhmi, on, seeing, rama, in, the, sundarkand, hanuman, tells, ravana, that, brahma, vishnu, and, shiva, can, create, preserve, and, destroy, by, the, might, of, rama, in, the, lankakand, tulsidas, presents, the, universe, as, the, cosmic, form, of, rama, in, which, shiva, is, the, consciousness, brahma, is, the, reason, and, vishnu, is, his, intelligence, as, per, tulsidas, rama, is, not, only, an, avatar, but, also, the, source, of, avatars, krishna, is, also, an, avatar, of, rama, thus, tulsidas, clearly, considers, rama, as, supreme, brahman, and, not, an, avatar, of, vishnu, in, the, opinion, of, urvashi, soorati, the, rama, of, tulsidas, is, an, amalgamation, of, vishnu, who, takes, avatars, vishnu, in, the, abode, of, ksheera, sagara, brahman, and, the, para, manifestation, of, the, pancharatra, macfie, concludes, that, tulsidas, makes, a, double, claim, i, e, rama, is, an, incarnation, of, both, vishnu, and, brahman, in, the, words, of, lutgendorf, tulsidas, rama, is, at, once, valmiki, s, exemplary, prince, the, cosmic, vishnu, of, puranas, and, the, transcendent, brahman, of, the, advaitins, in, the, sundarkand, of, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, says, that, rama, is, knowable, by, vedanta, as, per, tulsidas, rama, is, the, efficient, and, material, cause, nimitta, and, upadana, of, the, world, which, is, real, since, rama, is, real, in, several, verses, of, the, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, says, that, the, animate, and, inanimate, world, is, a, manifestation, of, rama, and, the, universe, is, the, cosmic, form, of, rama, authors, interpret, these, verses, to, mean, that, the, world, is, real, according, to, tulsidas, in, keeping, with, the, vishishtadvaita, philosophy, of, ramanuja, however, at, some, places, in, the, ramcharitmanas, and, kavitavali, tulsidas, compares, the, world, to, a, night, or, a, dream, and, says, it, is, mithya, false, or, unreal, some, commentators, interpret, these, verses, to, mean, that, in, tulsidas, opinion, the, world, is, unreal, as, per, the, vivartavada, doctrine, of, adi, shankara, while, some, others, interpret, them, to, mean, that, the, world, is, transient, yet, real, as, per, the, satkhyativada, doctrine, of, ramananda, uday, bhanu, singh, concludes, that, in, tulsidas, view, the, world, is, essentially, the, form, of, rama, and, appears, to, be, different, from, rama, due, to, maya, its, visible, form, is, transient, which, is, what, tulsidas, means, by, mithya, in, the, vinayapatrika, tulsidas, says, that, the, world, in, itself, is, neither, true, satya, nor, false, asatya, nor, both, true, and, false, together, satyasatya, one, who, casts, aside, all, these, three, illusions, knows, oneself, this, has, been, interpreted, to, mean, that, as, per, tulsidas, the, entire, world, is, a, lila, of, rama, at, the, beginning, of, the, ramcharitmanas, tulsidas, performs, samasti, vandana, obeisance, to, all, beings, in, which, he, bows, down, to, the, world, also, saying, it, is, pervaded, by, or, born, out, of, sita, and, rama, as, per, some, verses, in, ramcharitmanas, and, vinaypatrika, when, a, jiva, living, being, knows, the, self, maya, and, rama, it, sees, the, world, as, being, pervaded, by, rama, in, the, balkand, episode, of, the, marriage, of, the, princes, of, ayodhya, with, the, princesses, of, mithila, tulsidas, presents, a, metaphor, in, which, the, four, brides, are, compared, with, the, four, states, of, consciousness, the, waking, state, jagrat, sleep, with, dreams, swapna, dreamless, sleep, sushupti, and, the, fourth, self, conscious, state, turiya, the, four, grooms, are, compared, with, the, presiding, divinity, vibhu, of, the, four, states, vishva, taijasa, prajna, and, brahman, tulsidas, says, as, the, four, states, of, consciousness, with, their, presiding, divinities, reside, in, the, mind, of, a, jiva, so, the, four, brides, with, their, grooms, are, resplendent, in, the, same, pavilion, tulsidas, identifies, maya, with, sita, the, inseparable, energy, of, rama, which, takes, avatar, along, with, rama, in, his, view, maya, is, of, two, types, vidya, and, avidya, vidya, maya, is, the, cause, of, creation, and, the, liberation, of, jiva, avidya, maya, is, the, cause, of, illusion, and, bondage, of, the, jiva, the, entire, world, is, under, the, control, of, maya, maya, is, essentially, the, same, but, the, two, divisions, are, made, for, cognitive, purposes, this, view, of, tulsidas, is, in, accordance, with, vaishnava, teachers, of, vedanta, as, per, tulsidas, there, is, no, incompatibility, between, devotion, to, rama, and, attachment, to, shiva, tulsidas, equates, the, guru, as, an, incarnation, of, shiva, and, a, considerable, part, of, the, balkand, of, ramcharitmanas, is, devoted, to, the, narrative, of, shiva, including, the, abandonment, of, sati, the, penance, of, parvati, the, burning, of, kamadeva, and, the, marriage, of, parvati, and, shiva, in, addition, tulsidas, venerates, the, whole, hindu, pantheon, the, ramcharitmanas, begins, with, reverence, of, ganesh, sarasvati, parvati, shiva, the, guru, valmiki, and, hanuman, at, the, beginning, of, the, vinayapatrika, he, bows, to, ganesh, surya, shiva, devi, ganga, yamuna, varanasi, and, chitrakoot, asking, them, for, devotion, towards, rama, the, practical, end, of, all, his, writings, is, to, inculcate, bhakti, addressed, to, rama, as, the, greatest, means, of, salvation, and, emancipation, from, the, chain, of, births, and, deaths, a, salvation, which, is, as, free, and, open, to, men, of, the, lowest, caste, from, his, time, tulsidas, has, been, acclaimed, by, indian, and, western, scholars, alike, for, his, poetry, and, his, impact, on, the, hindu, society, tulsidas, mentions, in, his, work, kavitavali, that, he, was, considered, a, great, sage, in, the, world, madhus, dana, sarasvat, one, of, the, most, acclaimed, philosophers, of, the, advaita, vedanta, tradition, based, in, varanasi, and, the, composer, of, advaitasiddhi, was, a, contemporary, of, tulsidas, on, reading, the, ramcharitmanas, he, was, astonished, and, composed, the,
