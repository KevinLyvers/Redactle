reflect, his, real, environment, and, emotions, in, his, hokku, even, during, his, lifetime, the, effort, and, style, of, his, poetry, was, widely, appreciated, after, his, death, it, only, increased, several, of, his, students, compiled, quotations, from, him, about, his, own, poetry, most, notably, mukai, kyorai, and, hattori, doh, during, the, 18th, century, appreciation, of, bash, s, poems, grew, more, fervent, and, commentators, such, as, ishiko, sekisui, and, moro, nanimaru, went, to, great, length, to, find, references, in, his, hokku, to, historical, events, medieval, books, and, other, poems, these, commentators, were, often, lavish, in, their, praise, of, bash, s, obscure, references, some, of, which, were, probably, literary, false, cognates, in, 1793, bash, was, deified, by, the, shinto, bureaucracy, and, for, a, time, criticizing, his, poetry, was, literally, blasphemous, in, the, late, 19th, century, this, period, of, unanimous, passion, for, bash, s, poems, came, to, an, end, masaoka, shiki, arguably, bash, s, most, famous, critic, tore, down, the, long, standing, orthodoxy, with, his, bold, and, candid, objections, to, bash, s, style, however, shiki, was, also, instrumental, in, making, bash, s, poetry, accessible, in, english, and, to, leading, intellectuals, and, the, japanese, public, at, large, he, invented, the, term, haiku, replacing, hokku, to, refer, to, the, freestanding, 5, 7, 5, form, which, he, considered, the, most, artistic, and, desirable, part, of, the, haikai, no, renga, basho, was, illustrated, in, one, of, tsukioka, yoshitoshi, s, ukiyo, e, woodblock, prints, from, the, one, hundred, aspects, of, the, moon, collection, c, 1885, 1892, his, bunky, hermitage, was, illustrated, by, hiroshige, in, the, one, hundred, famous, views, of, edo, collection, published, around, 1857, critical, interpretation, of, bash, s, poems, continued, into, the, 20th, century, with, notable, works, by, yamamoto, kenkichi, imoto, n, ichi, and, ogata, tsutomu, the, 20th, century, also, saw, translations, of, bash, s, poems, into, other, languages, around, the, world, the, position, of, bash, in, western, eyes, as, the, haiku, poet, par, excellence, gives, great, influence, to, his, poetry, western, preference, for, haiku, over, more, traditional, forms, such, as, tanka, or, renga, have, rendered, archetypal, status, to, bash, as, japanese, poet, and, haiku, as, japanese, poetry, some, western, scholars, even, believe, that, bash, invented, haiku, the, impressionistic, and, concise, nature, of, bash, s, verse, greatly, influenced, ezra, pound, the, imagists, and, poets, of, the, beat, generation, on, this, question, jaime, lorente, maintains, in, his, research, work, bash, y, el, metro, 5, 7, 5, that, of, the, 1012, hokkus, analyzed, by, master, bash, 145, cannot, fit, into, the, 5, 7, 5, meter, since, they, are, a, broken, meter, specifically, they, present, a, greater, number, of, mora, in, percentage, they, represent, 15, of, the, total, even, establishing, 50, poems, that, presenting, this, 5, 7, 5, pattern, could, be, framed, in, another, structure, due, to, the, placement, of, the, particle, ya, the, figure, is, similar, therefore, lorente, concludes, that, the, teacher, was, close, to, the, traditional, pattern, in, 1942, the, haiseiden, building, was, constructed, in, iga, mie, to, commemorate, the, 300th, anniversary, of, basho, s, birth, featuring, a, circular, roof, named, the, traveler, s, umbrella, the, building, was, made, to, resemble, basho, s, face, and, clothing, two, of, bash, s, poems, were, popularized, in, the, short, story, teddy, written, by, j, d, salinger, and, published, in, 1952, by, the, new, yorker, magazine, in, 1979, the, international, astronomical, union, named, a, crater, found, on, mercury, after, him, in, 2003, an, international, anthology, film, titled, winter, days, adapted, basho, s, 1684, renku, collection, of, the, same, name, into, a, series, of,
