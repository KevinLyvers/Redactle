arab, scholars, and, historians, recently, ibn, khaldun, s, works, have, been, compared, with, those, of, influential, european, philosophers, such, as, niccol, machiavelli, giambattista, vico, david,

he, wrote, an, autobiography, at, ta, r, f, bi, ibn, khald, n, wa, ri, latih, gharban, wa, sharqan, presenting, ibn, khaldun, and, his, journey, west, and, east, in, which, numerous, documents, regarding, his, life, are, quoted, word, for, word, ab, zayd, abdu, r, rahman, bin, muhammad, bin, khald, n, al, hadrami, generally, known, as, ibn, khald, n, after, a, remote, ancestor, was, born, in, tunis, in, ad, 1332, 732, ah, into, an, upper, class, andalusian, family, of, arab, descent, the, family, s, ancestor, was, a, hadhrami, who, shared, kinship, with, wa, l, ibn, hujr, a, companion, of, the, islamic, prophet, muhammad, his, family, which, held, many, high, offices, in, al, andalus, had, emigrated, to, tunisia, after, the, fall, of, seville, to, the, reconquista, in, ad, 1248,

mystical, order, his, brother, yahya, khaldun, was, also, a, historian, who, wrote, a, book, on, the, abdalwadid, dynasty, and, was, assassinated, by, a, rival, for, being, the, official, historiographer, of, the, court, in, his, autobiography, khaldun, traces, his, descent, back, to, the, time, of, muhammad, through, an, arab, tribe, from, the, south, of, the, arabian, peninsula, specifically, the, hadhramaut, which, came, to, the, iberian, peninsula, in, the, 8th, century, at, the, beginning, of, the, islamic, conquest, and, our, ancestry, is, from, hadhramaut, from, the,

insistence, and, attachment, to, his, claim, of, arab, ancestry, at, a, time, of, berber, dynasties, domination, is, a, valid, reason, to, believe, his, claim, of, arab, descent, his, family, s, high, rank, enabled, ibn, khaldun, to, study, with, prominent, teachers, in, maghreb, he, received, a, classical, islamic, education, studying, the, quran, which, he, memorized, by, heart, arabic, linguistics, the, basis, for, understanding, the, qur, an, hadith, sharia, law, and, fiqh, jurisprudence, he, received, certification, ijazah, for, all, of, those, subjects, the, mathematician, and, philosopher, al, abili, of, tlemcen, introduced, him, to, mathematics, logic, and, philosophy, and, he, studied, especially, the, works, of, averroes, avicenna, razi, and, tusi, at, the, age, of, 17, ibn, khald, n, lost, both, his, parents, to, the, black, death, an, intercontinental, epidemic, of, the, plague, that, hit, tunis, in, 1348, 1349, following, family, tradition, he, strove, for, a, political, career, in, the, face, of, a, tumultuous, political, situation, in, north, africa, that, required, a, high, degree, of, skill, in, developing, and, dropping, alliances, prudently, to, avoid, falling, with, the, short, lived, regimes, of, the, time, ibn, khald, n, s, autobiography, is, the, story, of, an, adventure, in, which, he, spends, time, in, prison, reaches, the, highest, offices, and, falls, again, into, exile, at, the, age, of, 20, he, began, his, political, career, in, the, chancellery, of, the, tunisian, ruler, ibn, tafrakin, with, the, position, of, k, tib, al, al, mah, seal, bearer, which, consisted, of, writing, in, fine, calligraphy, the, typical, introductory, notes, of, official, documents, in, 1352, ab, ziad, the, sultan, of, constantine, marched, on, tunis, and, defeated, it, ibn, khald, n, in, any, case, unhappy, with, his, respected, but, politically, meaningless, position, followed, his, teacher, abili, to, fez, there, the, marinid, sultan, ab, inan, fares, i, appointed, him, as, a, writer, of, royal, proclamations, but, ibn, khald, n, still, schemed, against, his, employer, which, in, 1357, got, the, 25, year, old, a, 22, month, prison, sentence, upon, the, death, of, ab, inan, in, 1358, vizier, al, has, n, ibn, umar, granted, him, freedom, and, reinstated, him, to, his, rank, and, offices, ibn, khald, n, then, schemed, against, ab, inan, s, successor, ab, salem, ibrahim, iii, with, ab, salem, s, exiled, uncle, ab, salem, when, ab, salem, came, to, power, he, gave, ibn, khald, n, a, ministerial, position, the, first, position, to, correspond, with, ibn, khald, n, s, ambitions, the, treatment, that, ibn, khaldun, received, after, the, fall, of, ab, salem, through, ibn, amar, abdullah, a, friend, of, ibn, khald, n, s, was, not, to, his, liking, as, he, received, no, significant, official, position, at, the, same, time, amar, successfully, prevented, ibn, khald, n, whose, political, skills, he, knew, well, from, allying, with, the, abd, al, wadids, in, tlemcen, ibn, khald, n, therefore, decided, to, move, to, granada, he, could, be, sure, of, a, positive, welcome, there, since, at, fez, he, had, helped, the, sultan, of, granada, the, nasrid, muhammad, v, regain, power, from, his, temporary, exile, in, 1364, muhammad, entrusted, him, with, a, diplomatic, mission, to, the, king, of, castile, pedro, the, cruel, to, endorse, a, peace, treaty, ibn, khald, n, successfully, carried, out, this, mission, and, politely, declined, pedro, s, offer, to, remain, at, his, court, and, have, his, family, s, spanish, possessions, returned, to, him, in, granada, ibn, khald, n, quickly, came, into, competition, with, muhammad, s, vizier, ibn, al, khatib, who, viewed, the, close, relationship, between, muhammad, and, ibn, khald, n, with, increasing, mistrust, ibn, khald, n, tried, to, shape, the, young, muhammad, into, his, ideal, of, a, wise, ruler, an, enterprise, that, ibn, al, khatib, thought, foolish, and, a, danger, to, peace, in, the, country, as, a, result, of, al, khatib, s, influence, ibn, khald, n, was, eventually, sent, back, to, north, africa, al, khatib, himself, was, later, accused, by, muhammad, of, having, unorthodox, philosophical, views, and, murdered, despite, an, attempt, by, ibn, khald, n, to, intercede, on, behalf, of, his, old, rival, in, his, autobiography, ibn, khald, n, tells, little, about, his, conflict, with, ibn, al, khatib, and, the, reasons, for, his, departure, orientalist, muhsin, mahdi, interprets, that, as, showing, that, ibn, khald, n, later, realised, that, he, had, completely, misjudged, muhammad, v, back, in, ifriqiya, the, hafsid, sultan, of, bougie, ab, abdall, h, who, had, been, his, companion, in, prison, received, him, with, great, enthusiasm, and, made, ibn, khald, n, his, prime, minister, ibn, khald, n, carried, out, a, daring, mission, to, collect, taxes, among, the, local, berber, tribes, after, the, death, of, ab, abdall, h, in, 1366, ibn, khald, n, changed, sides, once, again, and, allied, himself, with, the, sultan, of, tlemcen, ab, l, abbas, a, few, years, later, he, was, taken, prisoner, by, abu, faris, abdul, aziz, who, had, defeated, the, sultan, of, tlemcen, and, seized, the, throne, he, then, entered, a, monastic, establishment, and, occupied, himself, with, scholastic, duties, until, 1370, in, that, year, he, was, sent, for, to, tlemcen, by, the, new, sultan, after, the, death, of, abdu, l, az, z, he, resided, at, fez, enjoying, the, patronage, and, confidence, of, the, regent, ibn, khald, n, s, political, skills, and, above, all, his, good, relationship, with, the, wild, berber, tribes, were, in, high, demand, among, the, north, african, rulers, but, he, had, begun, to, tire, of, politics, and, constantly, switching, allegiances, in, 1375, he, was, sent, by, ab, hammu, the, abdu, l, wadid, sultan, of, tlemcen, on, a, mission, to, the, dawadida, arabs, tribes, of, biskra, after, his, return, to, the, west, ibn, khald, n, sought, refuge, with, one, of, the, berber, tribes, in, the, west, of, algeria, in, the, town, of, qalat, ibn, salama, he, lived, there, for, over, three, years, under, their, protection, taking, advantage, of, his, seclusion, to, write, the, muqaddimah, prolegomena, the, introduction, to, his, planned, history, of, the, world, in, ibn, salama, however, he, lacked, the, necessary, texts, to, complete, the, work, therefore, in, 1378, he, returned, to, his, native, tunis, which, had, meanwhile, been, conquered, by, ab, l, abbas, who, took, ibn, khald, n, back, into, his, service, there, he, devoted, himself, almost, exclusively, to, his, studies, and, completed, his, history, of, the, world, his, relationship, with, ab, l, abbas, remained, strained, as, the, latter, questioned, his, loyalty, that, was, brought, into, sharp, contrast, after, ibn, khald, n, presented, him, with, a, copy, of, the, completed, history, that, omitted, the, usual, panegyric, to, the, ruler, under, pretence, of, going, on, the, hajj, to, mecca, something, for, which, a, muslim, ruler, could, not, simply, refuse, permission, ibn, khald, n, was, able, to, leave, tunis, and, to, sail, to, alexandria, ibn, khaldun, said, of, egypt, he, who, has, not, seen, it, does, not, know, the, power, of, islam, while, other, islamic, regions, had, to, cope, with, border, wars, and, inner, strife, mamluk, egypt, enjoyed, prosperity, and, high, culture, in, 1384, the, egyptian, sultan, al, malik, udh, dhahir, barquq, made, khaldun, professor, of, the, qamhiyyah, madrasah, and, appointed, him, as, the, grand, qadi, of, the, maliki, school, of, fiqh, one, of, four, schools, the, maliki, school, was, widespread, primarily, in, western, africa, his, efforts, at, reform, encountered, resistance, however, and, within, a, year, he, had, to, resign, his, judgeship, also, in, 1384, a, ship, carrying, khaldun, s, wife, and, children, sank, off, of, alexandria, after, his, return, from, a, pilgrimage, to, mecca, in, may, 1388, ibn, khald, n, concentrated, on, teaching, at, various, cairo, madrasas, at, the, mamluk, court, he, fell, from, favor, because, during, revolts, against, barquq, he, had, apparently, under, duress, with, other, cairo, jurists, issued, a, fatwa, against, barquq, later, relations, with, barquq, returned, to, normal, and, he, was, once, again, named, the, maliki, qadi, altogether, he, was, called, six, times, to, that, high, office, which, for, various, reasons, he, never, held, long, in, 1401, under, barquq, s, successor, his, son, faraj, ibn, khald, n, took, part, in, a, military, campaign, against, the, mongol, conqueror, timur, who, besieged, damascus, in, 1400, ibn, khald, n, cast, doubt, upon, the, viability, of, the, venture, and, really, wanted, to, stay, in, egypt, his, doubts, were, vindicated, as, the, young, and, inexperienced, faraj, concerned, about, a, revolt, in, egypt, left, his, army, to, its, own, devices, in, syria, and, hurried, home, ibn, khald, n, remained, at, the, besieged, city, for, seven, weeks, being, lowered, over, the, city, wall, by, ropes, to, negotiate, with, timur, in, a, historic, series, of, meetings, that, he, reported, extensively, in, his, autobiography, timur, questioned, him, in, detail, about, conditions, in, the, lands, of, the, maghreb, at, his, request, ibn, khald, n, even, wrote, a, long, report, about, it, as, he, recognized, timur, s, intentions, he, did, not, hesitate, on, his, return, to, egypt, to, compose, an, equally, extensive, report, on, the, history, of, the, tatars, together, with, a, character, study, of, timur, sending, them, to, the, merinid, rulers, in, fez, ibn, khald, n, spent, the, next, five, years, in, cairo, completing, his, autobiography, and, his, history, of, the, world, and, acting, as, teacher, and, judge, meanwhile, he, was, alleged, to, have, joined, an, underground, party, rijal, hawa, rijal, whose, reform, oriented, ideals, attracted, the, attention, of, local, political, authorities, the, elderly, ibn, khaldun, was, placed, under, arrest, he, died, on, 17, march, 1406, one, month, after, his, sixth, selection, for, the, office, of, the, maliki, qadi, judge, concerning, the, discipline, of, sociology, he, described, the, dichotomy, of, sedentary, life, versus, nomadic, life, as, well, as, the, inevitable, loss, of, power, that, occurs, when, warriors, conquer, a, city, according, to, the, arab, scholar, sati, al, husri, the, muqaddimah, may, be, read, as, a, sociological, work, the, work, is, based, around, ibn, khaldun, s, central, concept, of, a, abiyyah, translated, as, group, cohesiveness, or, solidarity, this, social, cohesion, arises, spontaneously, in, tribes, and, other, small, kinship, groups, it, can, be, intensified, and, enlarged, by, a, religious, ideology, ibn, khaldun, s, analysis, looks, at, how, this, cohesion, carries, groups, to, power, but, contains, within, itself, the, seeds, psychological, sociological, economic, political, of, the, group, s, downfall, to, be, replaced, by, a, new, group, dynasty, or, empire, bound, by, a, stronger, or, at, least, younger, and, more, vigorous, cohesion, some, of, ibn, khaldun, s, views, particularly, those, concerning, the, zanj, people, of, sub, saharan, africa, have, been, cited, as, racist, though, they, were, not, uncommon, for, their, time, according, to, the, scholar, abdelmajid, hannoum, ibn, khaldun, s, description, of, the, distinctions, between, berbers, and, arabs, were, misinterpreted, by, the, translator, william, mcguckin, de, slane, who, wrongly, inserted, a, racial, ideology, that, sets, arabs, and, berbers, apart, and, in, opposition, into, his, translation, of, part, of, ibar, translated, under, the, title, histoire, des, berb, res, perhaps, the, most, frequently, cited, observation, drawn, from, ibn, khald, n, s, work, is, the, notion, that, when, a, society, becomes, a, great, civilization, its, high, point, is, followed, by, a, period, of, decay, this, means, that, the, next, cohesive, group, that, conquers, the, diminished, civilization, is, by, comparison, a, group, of, barbarians, once, the, barbarians, solidify, their, control, over, the, conquered, society, however, they, become, attracted, to, its, more, refined, aspects, such, as, literacy, and, arts, and, either, assimilate, into, or, appropriate, such, cultural, practices, then, eventually, the, former, barbarians, will, be, conquered, by, a, new, set, of, barbarians, who, will, repeat, the, process, georgetown, university, professor, ibrahim, oweiss, an, economist, and, historian, argues, that, ibn, khaldun, was, a, major, forerunner, of, modern, economists, and, in, particular, originated, the, labor, theory, of, value, long, before, better, known, proponents, such, as, adam, smith, and, david, ricardo, although, khaldun, did, not, refer, to, it, as, either, a, labor, theory, of, value, or, theory, ibn, khaldun, also, called, for, the, creation, of, a, science, to, explain, society, and, went, on, to, outline, these, ideas, in, his, major, work, the, muqaddimah, which, states, that, civilization, and, its, well, being, as, well, as, business, prosperity, depend, on, productivity, and, people, s, efforts, in, all, directions, in, their, own, interest, and, profit, ibn, khaldun, diverged, from, norms, that, muslim, historians, followed, and, rejected, their, focus, on, the, credibility, of, the, transmitter, and, focused, instead, on, the, validity, of, the, stories, and, encouraged, critical, thinking, ibn, khaldun, also, outlines, early, theories, of, division, of, labor, taxes, scarcity, and, economic, growth, he, argued, that, poverty, was, a, result, of, the, destruction, of, morality, and, human, values, he, also, looked, at, what, factors, contribute, to, wealth, such, as, consumption, government, and, investment, khaldun, also, argued, that, poverty, was, not, necessarily, a, result, of, poor, financial, decision, making, but, of, external, consequences, and, therefore, the, government, should, be, involved, in, alleviating, poverty, researchers, from, malaysia, s, insaniah, university, college, and, indonesia, s, tazkia, university, college, of, islamic, economics, created, a, dynamics, model, based, upon, ibn, khaldun, s, writings, to, measure, poverty, in, the, muslim, nations, of, south, asia, and, southeast, asia, ibn, khaldun, also, believed, that, the, currency, of, an, islamic, monetary, system, should, have, intrinsic, value, and, therefore, be, made, of, gold, and, silver, such, as, the, dirham, he, emphasized, that, the, weight, and, purity, of, these, coins, should, be, strictly, followed, the, weight, of, one, dinar, should, be, one, mithqal, the, weight, of, 72, grains, of, barley, roughly, 4, 25, grams, and, the, weight, of, 7, dinar, should, be, equal, to, weight, of, 10, dirhams, 7, 10, of, a, mithqal, or, 2, 96, grams, ibn, khaldun, s, writings, regarding, the, division, of, labor, are, often, compared, to, adam, smith, s, writings, on, the, topic, the, individual, being, cannot, by, himself, obtain, all, the, necessities, of, life, all, human, beings, must, co, operate, to, that, end, in, their, civilization, but, what, is, obtained, by, the, cooperation, of, a, group, of, human, beings, satisfies, the, need, of, a, number, many, times, greater, than, themselves, for, instance, no, one, by, himself, can, obtain, the, share, of, the, wheat, he, needs, for, food, but, when, six, or, ten, persons, including, a, smith, and, a, carpenter, to, make, the, tools, and, others, who, are, in, charge, of, the, oxen, the, ploughing, of, the, harvesting, of, the, ripe, grain, and, all, other, agricultural, activities, undertake, to, obtain, their, food, and, work, toward, that, purpose, either, separately, or, collectively, and, thus, obtain, through, their, labour, a, certain, amount, of, food, that, amount, will, be, food, for, a, number, of, people, many, times, their, own, the, combined, labour, produces, more, than, the, needs, and, necessities, of, the, workers, ibn, khaldun, 1958, vol, ii, 271, 272, in, every, other, art, and, manufacture, the, effects, of, the, division, of, labour, are, similar, to, what, they, are, in, this, very, trifling, one, though, in, many, of, them, the, labour, can, either, be, so, much, subdivided, nor, reduced, to, so, great, a, simplicity, of, operation, the, division, of, labour, however, so, far, as, it, can, be, introduced, occasions, in, every, art, a, proportionable, increase, of, the, productive, powers, of, labour, smith, 1976a, vol, i, 13, 24, both, ibn, khaldun, and, smith, shared, the, idea, that, the, division, of, labor, is, fundamental, to, economic, growth, however, the, motivations, and, context, for, such, division, differed, between, them, for, ibn, khaldun, asabiyyah, or, social, solidarity, was, the, underlying, motive, and, context, behind, the, division, of, labor, for, smith, it, was, self, interest, and, the, market, economy, ibn, khaldun, s, epistemology, attempted, to, reconcile, mysticism, with, theology, by, dividing, science, into, two, different, categories, the, religious, science, that, regards, the, sciences, of, the, qur, an, and, the, non, religious, science, he, further, classified, the, non, religious, sciences, into, intellectual, sciences, such, as, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, etc, and, auxiliary, sciences, such, as, language, literature, poetry, etc, he, also, suggested, that, possibly, more, divisions, will, appear, in, the, future, with, different, societies, he, tried, to, adapt, to, all, possible, societies, cultural, behavior, and, influence, in, education, economics, and, politics, nonetheless, he, didn, t, think, that, laws, were, chosen, by, just, one, leader, or, a, small, group, of, individual, but, mostly, by, the, majority, of, the, individuals, of, a, society, to, ibn, khaldun, the, state, was, a, necessity, of, human, society, to, restrain, injustice, within, the, society, but, the, state, means, is, force, thus, itself, an, injustice, all, societies, must, have, a, state, governing, them, in, order, to, establish, a, society, he, attempted, to, standardize, the, history, of, societies, by, identifying, ubiquitous, phenomena, present, in, all, societies, to, him, civilization, was, a, phenomenon, that, will, be, present, as, long, as, humans, exist, he, characterized, the, fulfillment, of, basic, needs, as, the, beginning, of, civilization, at, the, beginning, people, will, look, for, different, ways, of, increasing, productivity, of, basic, needs, and, expansion, will, occur, later, the, society, starts, becoming, more, sedentary, and, focuses, more, on, crafting, arts, and, the, more, refined, characteristics, by, the, end, of, a, society, it, will, weaken, allowing, another, small, group, of, individuals, to, come, into, control, the, conquering, group, is, described, as, an, unsatisfied, group, within, the, society, itself, or, a, group, of, desert, bandits, that, constantly, attack, other, weaker, or, weakened, societies, in, the, muqaddimah, his, most, important, work, he, discusses, an, introduction, of, philosophy, to, history, in, a, general, manner, based, on, observable, patterns, within, a, theoretical, framework, of, known, historical, events, of, his, time, he, described, the, beginnings, development, cultural, trends, and, the, fall, of, all, societies, leading, to, the, rise, of, a, new, society, which, would, then, follow, the, same, trends, in, a, continuous, cycle, also, he, recommended, the, best, political, approaches, to, develop, a, society, according, to, his, knowledge, of, history, he, heavily, emphasized, that, a, good, society, would, be, one, in, which, a, tradition, of, education, is, deeply, rooted, in, its, culture, ibn, khaldun, 1987, introduced, the, word, asabiya, solidarity, group, feeling, or, group, consciousness, to, explain, tribalism, the, concept, of, asabiya, has, been, translated, as, social, cohesion, group, solidarity, or, tribalism, this, social, cohesion, arises, spontaneously, in, tribes, and, other, small, kinship, groups, rashed, 2017, ibn, khaldun, believed, that, too, much, bureaucracy, such, as, taxes, and, legislations, would, lead, to, the, decline, of, a, society, since, it, would, constrain, the, development, of, more, specialized, labor, increase, in, scholars, and, development, of, different, services, he, believed, that, bureaucrats, cannot, understand, the, world, of, commerce, and, do, not, possess, the, same, motivation, as, a, businessman, in, his, work, the, muqaddimah, ibn, khaldun, emphasizes, human, beings, faculty, to, think, fikr, as, what, determines, human, behavior, and, ubiquitous, patterns, this, faculty, is, also, what, inspires, human, beings, to, form, into, a, social, structure, to, co, operate, in, division, of, labor, and, organization, according, to, zaid, ahmand, in, epistemology, and, the, human, dimension, in, urban, studies, the, fikr, faculty, is, the, supporting, pillar, for, all, philosophical, aspects, of, ibn, khaldun, s, theory, related, to, human, beings, spiritual, intellectual, physical, social, and, political, tendencies, another, important, concept, he, emphasizes, in, his, work, is, the, mastery, of, crafts, habits, and, skills, this, takes, place, after, a, society, is, established, and, according, to, ibn, khaldun, the, level, of, achievement, of, a, society, can, be, determined, by, just, analyzing, these, three, concepts, a, society, in, its, earliest, stages, is, nomadic, and, primarily, concerned, with, survival, while, a, society, at, a, later, stage, is, sedentary, with, greater, achievement, in, crafts, a, society, with, a, sedentary, culture, and, stable, politics, would, be, expected, to, have, greater, achievements, in, crafts, and, technology, ibn, khaldun, also, emphasized, in, his, epistemology, the, important, aspect, that, educational, tradition, plays, to, ensure, the, new, generations, of, a, civilization, continuously, improve, in, the, sciences, and, develop, culture, ibn, khaldun, argued, that, without, the, strong, establishment, of, an, educational, tradition, it, would, be, very, difficult, for, the, new, generations, to, maintain, the, achievements, of, the, earlier, generations, let, alone, improve, them, another, way, to, distinguish, the, achievement, of, a, society, would, be, the, language, of, a, society, since, for, him, the, most, important, element, of, a, society, would, not, be, land, but, the, language, spoken, he, was, surprised, that, many, non, arabs, were, really, successful, in, the, arabic, society, had, good, jobs, and, were, well, received, by, the, community, these, people, were, non, arab, by, descent, but, they, grew, up, among, the, arabs, who, possessed, the, habit, of, arabic, ibn, khaldun, once, recalled, ecause, of, this, they, were, able, to, master, arabic, so, well, that, they, cannot, be, surpassed, he, believed, that, the, reason, why, non, arabs, were, accepted, as, part, of, arab, society, was, due, to, their, mastery, of, the, arabic, language, advancements, in, literary, works, such, as, poems, and, prose, were, another, way, to, distinguish, the, achievement, of, a, civilization, but, ibn, khaldun, believed, that, whenever, the, literary, facet, of, a, society, reaches, its, highest, levels, it, ceases, to, indicate, societal, achievements, anymore, but, is, an, embellishment, of, life, for, logical, sciences, he, established, knowledge, at, its, highest, level, as, an, increase, of, scholars, and, the, quality, of, knowledge, for, him, the, highest, level, of, literary, productions, would, be, the, manifestation, of, prose, poems, and, the, artistic, enrichment, of, a, society, ibn, khaldun, believes, that, communication, between, the, tangible, and, intangible, world, is, the, basis, of, every, religion, and, the, credit, for, its, occurrence, is, the, human, spirit, as, it, is, the, mediator, between, god, and, humans, it, is, immortal, by, nature, and, does, not, perish, and, has, characteristics, that, enable, it, to, communicate, with, god, however, most, souls, have, lost, their, hidden, ability, and, are, connected, to, the, sensory, world, only, a, small, number, of, them, still, maintain, their, full, ability, to, communicate, with, god, these, are, the, ones, god, chose, and, they, became, prophets, so, their, souls, leave, the, sensory, world, to, receive, from, god, their, souls, abandon, the, sensory, world, in, order, to, receive, from, god, what, they, should, convey, to, humans, religions, arise, only, from, this, connection, he, believes, that, religions, that, rely, on, institutions, of, prediction, and, reconnaissance, are, false, but, they, partly, contain, some, truth, a, person, s, concentration, on, a, specific, thing, for, a, long, period, makes, him, forget, everything, and, become, attached, to, what, he, focused, on, only, this, focus, makes, him, see, the, non, sensory, world, very, quickly, and, in, a, very, imperfect, way, and, these, are, pagan, religions, ibn, khaldun, agrees, with, sufism, and, believes, that, if, a, person, maintains, his, good, faith, and, is, stripped, of, the, desire, to, create, a, new, religion, and, strives, to, separate, himself, from, the, sensory, world, he, will, be, able, to, approach, the, divine, essence, and, the, ideas, of, scholars, will, appear, to, him, clearly, but, if, he, strives, in, this, detachment, and, mysticism, out, of, a, desire, to, excel, over, others, he, will, not, communicate, with, god, but, with, demons, also, the, human, spirit, is, able, to, see, some, things, of, the, future, through, vision, but, on, the, condition, that, this, spirit, be, completely, upright, and, very, pious, and, pure, otherwise, the, vision, will, come, from, the, devils, from, other, sources, we, know, of, several, other, works, primarily, composed, during, the, time, he, spent, in, north, africa, and, al, andalus, his, first, book, lub, bu, l, muhassal, a, commentary, on, the, islamic, theology, of, fakhr, al, din, al, razi, was, written, at, the, age, of, 19, under, the, supervision, of, his, teacher, al, abili, in, tunis, a, work, on, sufism, shif, u, l, s, il, was, composed, around, 1373, in, fes, morocco, whilst, at, the, court, of, muhammed, v, sultan, of, granada, ibn, khald, n, composed, a, work, on, logic, allaqa, li, s, sul, n, ibn, khaldun, s, historical, method, had, very, few, precedents, or, followers, in, his, time, while, ibn, khaldun, is, known, to, have, been, a, successful, lecturer, on, jurisprudence, within, religious, sciences, only, very, few, of, his, students, were, aware, of, and, influenced, by, his, muqaddimah, one, such, student, al, maqrizi, praised, the, muqaddimah, although, some, scholars, have, found, his, praise, and, that, of, others, to, be, generally, empty, and, lacking, understanding, of, ibn, khaldun, s, methods, ibn, khaldun, also, faced, primarily, criticism, from, his, contemporaries, particularly, ibn, hajar, al, asqalani, these, criticisms, included, accusations, of, inadequate, historical, knowledge, an, inaccurate, title, disorganization, and, a, style, resembling, that, of, the, prolific, arab, literature, writer, al, jahiz, al, asqalani, also, noted, that, ibn, khaldun, was, not, well, liked, in, egypt, because, he, opposed, many, respected, traditions, including, the, traditional, judicial, dress, and, suggested, that, this, may, have, contributed, to, the, reception, of, ibn, khaldun, s, historical, works, the, notable, exception, to, this, consensus, was, ibn, al, azraq, a, jurist, who, lived, shortly, after, ibn, khaldun, and, quoted, heavily, from, the, first, and, fourth, books, of, the, kitab, al, ibar, in, developing, a, work, of, mirrors, for, princes, ibn, khaldun, s, work, found, some, recognition, with, ottoman, intellectuals, in, the, 17th, century, the, first, references, to, ibn, khaldun, in, ottoman, writings, appeared, in, the, middle, of, the, 17th, century, with, historians, such, as, k, tip, elebi, naming, him, as, a, great, influence, while, another, turkish, ottoman, historian, mustafa, naima, attempted, to, use, ibn, khaldun, s, cyclical, theory, of, the, rise, and, fall, of, empires, to, describe, the, ottoman, empire, increasing, perceptions, of, the, decline, of, the, ottoman, empire, also, caused, similar, ideas, to, appear, independently, of, ibn, khaldun, in, the, 16th, century, and, may, explain, some, of, the, influence, of, his, works, in, europe, ibn, khaldun, was, first, brought, to, the, attention, of, the, western, world, in, 1697, when, a, biography, of, him, appeared, in, barth, lemy, d, herbelot, de, molainville, s, biblioth, que, orientale, however, some, scholars, believe, that, ibn, khaldun, s, work, may, have, first, been, introduced, to, europe, via, ibn, arabshah, s, biography, of, tamerlane, translated, to, latin, which, covers, a, meeting, between, ibn, khaldun, and, tamerlane, according, to, ibn, arabshah, during, this, meeting, ibn, khaldun, and, tamerlane, discussed, the, maghrib, in, depth, as, well, as, tamerlane, s, genealogy, and, place, in, history, ibn, khaldun, began, gaining, more, attention, from, 1806, when, silvestre, de, sacy, s, chrestomathie, arabe, included, his, biography, together, with, a, translation, of, parts, of, the, muqaddimah, as, the, prolegomena, in, 1816, de, sacy, again, published, a, biography, with, a, more, detailed, description, on, the, prolegomena, more, details, on, and, partial, translations, of, the, prolegomena, emerged, over, the, years, until, the, complete, arabic, edition, was, published, in, 1858, since, then, the, work, of, ibn, khaldun, has, been, extensively, studied, in, the, western, world, with, special, interest, reynold, a, nicholson, praised, ibn, khaldun, as, a, uniquely, brilliant, muslim, sociologist, but, discounted, khaldun, s, influence, spanish, philosopher, jos, ortega, y, gasset, viewed, the, conflicts, of, north, africa, as, a, problem, that, stemmed, from, a, lack, of, african, thought, and, praised, ibn, khaldun, for, making, sense, of, the, conflict, by, simplifying, it, to, the, relationship, between, the, nomadic, and, sedentary, modes, of, life, british, historian, arnold, j, toynbee, has, called, ibn, khaldun, s, muqaddimah, the, greatest, work, of, its, kind, ernest, gellner, once, a, professor, of, philosophy, and, logic, at, the, london, school, of, economics, considered, khaldun, s, definition, of, government, the, best, in, the, history, of, political, theory, more, moderate, views, on, the, scope, of, ibn, khaldun, s, contributions, have, also, emerged, arthur, laffer, for, whom, the, laffer, curve, is, named, acknowledged, that, ibn, khaldun, s, ideas, as, well, as, others, precede, his, own, work, on, that, curve, economist, paul, krugman, described, ibn, khaldun, as, a, 14th, century, islamic, philosopher, who, basically, invented, what, we, would, now, call, the, social, sciences, 19th, century, scottish, theologian, and, philosopher, robert, flint, praised, him, strongly, as, a, theorist, of, history, he, had, no, equal, in, any, age, or, country, until, vico, appeared, more, than, three, hundred, years, later, plato, aristotle, and, augustine, were, not, his, peers, and, all, others, were, unworthy, of, being, even, mentioned, along, with, him, ibn, khaldun, s, work, on, evolution, of, societies, also, influenced, egon, orowan, who, introduced, the, concept, of, socionomy, while, ibn, khaldun, s, record, keeping, is, usually, passed, over, in, favor, of, recognizing, his, contributions, to, the, science, of, history, abderrahmane, lakhsassi, wrote, no, historian, of, the, maghreb, since, and, particularly, of, the, berbers, can, do, without, his, historical, contribution, public, recognition, of, ibn, khaldun, has, increased, in, recent, years, in, 2004, the, tunisian, community, center, launched, the, first, ibn, khaldun, award, to, recognize, a, tunisian, american, high, achiever, whose, work, reflects, ibn, khaldun, s, ideas, of, kinship, and, solidarity, the, award, was, named, after, ibn, khaldun, for, the, convergence, of, his, ideas, with, the, organization, s, objectives, and, programs, in, 2006, the, atlas, economic, research, foundation, launched, an, annual, essay, contest, for, students, named, in, ibn, khaldun, s, honor, the, theme, of, the, contest, is, how,
