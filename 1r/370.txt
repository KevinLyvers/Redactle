cante, jondo, poem, of, the, deep, song, not, published, until, 1931, so, he, naturally, composed, an, essay, on, the, art, of, flamenco, and, began, to, speak, publicly, in, support, of, the,

lorca, from, an, andalusian, story, inspired, by, the, same, structural, form, of, sequence, as, deep, song, his, collection, suites, 1923, was, never, finished, and, was, not, published, until, 1983, over, the, next, few, years, garc, a, lorca, became, increasingly, involved, in, spain, s, avant, garde, he, published, a, poetry, collection, called, canciones, songs, although, it, did, not, contain, songs, in, the, usual, sense, shortly, after, lorca, was, invited, to, exhibit, a, series, of, drawings, at, the, galeries, dalmau, in, barcelona, from, 25, june, to, 2, july, 1927, lorca, s, sketches, were, a, blend, of, popular, and, avant, garde, styles, complementing, canci, n, both, his, poetry, and, drawings, reflected, the, influence, of, traditional, andalusian, motifs, cubist, syntax, and, a, preoccupation, with, sexual, identity, several, drawings, consisted, of, superimposed, dreamlike, faces, or, shadows, he, later, described, the, double, faces, as, self, portraits, showing, man, s, capacity, for, crying, as, well, as, winning, in, line, with, his, conviction, that, sorrow, and, joy, were, as, inseparable, as, life, and, death, green, wind, green, branches, the, ship, out, on, the, sea, and, the, horse, on, the, mountain, with, the, shadow, at, the, waist, she, dreams, on, her, balcony, green, flesh, green, hair, with, eyes, of, cold, silver, from, romance, son, mbulo, sleepwalking, romance, garc, a, lorca, romancero, gitano, gypsy, ballads, 1928, part, of, his, cancion, series, became, his, best, known, book, of, poetry, it, was, a, highly, stylised, imitation, of, the, ballads, and, poems, that, were, still, being, told, throughout, the, spanish, countryside, garc, a, lorca, describes, the, work, as, a, carved, altar, piece, of, andalusia, with, gypsies, horses, archangels, planets, its, jewish, and, roman, breezes, rivers, crimes, the, everyday, touch, of, the, smuggler, and, the, celestial, note, of, the, naked, children, of, c, rdoba, a, book, that, hardly, expresses, visible, andalusia, at, all, but, where, the, hidden, andalusia, trembles, in, 1928, the, book, brought, him, fame, across, spain, and, the, hispanic, world, and, it, was, only, much, later, that, he, gained, notability, as, a, playwright, for, the, rest, of, his, life, the, writer, would, search, for, the, elements, of, andaluce, culture, trying, to, find, its, essence, without, resorting, to, the, picturesque, or, the, clich, d, use, of, local, colour, his, second, play, mariana, pineda, with, stage, settings, by, salvador, dal, opened, to, great, acclaim, in, barcelona, in, 1927, in, 1926, garc, a, lorca, wrote, the, play, the, shoemaker, s, prodigious, wife, which, would, not, be, shown, until, the, early, 1930s, it, was, a, farce, about, fantasy, based, on, the, relationship, between, a, flirtatious, petulant, wife, and, a, hen, pecked, shoemaker, from, 1925, to, 1928, he, was, passionately, involved, with, dal, although, dali, s, friendship, with, lorca, had, a, strong, element, of, mutual, passion, dal, said, he, rejected, the, erotic, advances, of, the, poet, with, the, success, of, gypsy, ballads, came, an, estrangement, from, dal, and, the, breakdown, of, a, love, affair, with, sculptor, emilio, aladr, n, perojo, these, brought, on, an, increasing, depression, a, situation, exacerbated, by, his, anguish, over, his, homosexuality, he, felt, he, was, trapped, between, the, persona, of, the, successful, author, which, he, was, forced, to, maintain, in, public, and, the, tortured, authentic, self, which, he, could, acknowledge, only, in, private, he, also, had, the, sense, that, he, was, being, pigeon, holed, as, a, gypsy, poet, he, wrote, the, gypsies, are, a, theme, and, nothing, more, i, could, just, as, well, be, a, poet, of, sewing, needles, or, hydraulic, landscapes, besides, this, gypsyism, gives, me, the, appearance, of, an, uncultured, ignorant, and, primitive, poet, that, you, know, very, well, i, m, not, i, don, t, want, to, be, typecast, growing, estrangement, between, garc, a, lorca, and, his, closest, friends, reached, its, climax, when, surrealists, dal, and, luis, bu, uel, collaborated, on, their, 1929, film, un, chien, andalou, an, andalusian, dog, garc, a, lorca, interpreted, it, perhaps, erroneously, as, a, vicious, attack, upon, himself, at, this, time, dal, also, met, his, future, wife, gala, aware, of, these, problems, though, not, perhaps, of, their, causes, garc, a, lorca, s, family, arranged, for, him, to, make, a, lengthy, visit, to, the, united, states, in, 1929, 30, in, june, 1929, garc, a, lorca, travelled, to, the, us, with, fernando, de, los, rios, on, the, rms, olympic, a, sister, liner, to, the, rms, titanic, they, stayed, mostly, in, new, york, city, where, rios, started, a, lecture, tour, and, garc, a, lorca, enrolled, at, columbia, university, school, of, general, studies, funded, by, his, parents, he, studied, english, but, as, before, was, absorbed, more, by, writing, than, by, study, at, columbia, he, lived, in, room, 617, in, furnald, hall, before, moving, to, room, 1231, in, john, jay, hall, he, also, spent, time, in, vermont, and, later, in, havana, cuba, his, collection, poeta, en, nueva, york, poet, in, new, york, published, posthumously, in, 1940, explores, alienation, and, isolation, through, some, graphically, experimental, poetic, techniques, and, was, influenced, by, the, wall, street, crash, which, he, personally, witnessed, this, condemnation, of, urban, capitalist, society, and, materialistic, modernity, was, a, sharp, departure, from, his, earlier, work, and, label, as, a, folklorist, his, play, of, this, time, el, p, blico, the, public, was, not, published, until, the, late, 1970s, and, has, never, been, published, in, its, entirety, the, complete, manuscript, apparently, lost, however, the, hispanic, society, of, america, in, new, york, city, retains, several, of, his, personal, letters, garc, a, lorca, s, return, to, spain, in, 1930, coincided, with, the, fall, of, the, dictatorship, of, primo, de, rivera, and, the, establishment, of, the, second, spanish,

little, equipment, they, sought, to, bring, theatre, to, people, who, had, never, seen, any, with, garc, a, lorca, directing, as, well, as, acting, he, commented, outside, of, madrid, the, theatre, which, is, in, its, very, essence, a, part, of, the, life, of, the, people, is, almost, dead, and, the, people, suffer, accordingly, as, they, would, if, they, had, lost, their, two, eyes, or, ears, or, a, sense, of, taste, we, are, going, to, give, it, back, to, them, his, experiences, travelling, through, impoverished, rural, spain, and, new, york, particularly, amongst, the, disenfranchised, african, american, population, transformed, him, into, a, passionate, advocate, of, the, theatre, of, social, action, he, wrote, the, theatre, is, a, school, of, weeping, and, of, laughter, a, free, forum, where, men, can, question, norms, that, are, outmoded, or, mistaken, and, explain, with, living, example, the, eternal, norms, of, the, human, heart, while, touring, with, la, barraca, garc, a, lorca, wrote, his, now, best, known, plays, the, rural, trilogy, of, blood, wedding, yerma, and, the, house, of, bernarda, alba, which, all, rebelled, against, the, norms, of, bourgeois, spanish, society, he, called, for, a, rediscovery, of, the, roots, of, european, theatre, and, the, questioning, of, comfortable, conventions, such, as, the, popular, drawing, room, comedies, of, the, time,

life, declaring, in, 1936, theatre, is, poetry, that, rises, from, the, book, and, becomes, human, enough, to, talk, and, shout, weep, and, despair, travelling, to, buenos, aires, in, 1933, to, give, lectures, and, direct, the, argentine, premiere, of, blood, wedding, garc, a, lorca, spoke, of, his, distilled, theories, on, artistic, creation, and, performance, in, the, famous, lecture, play, and, theory, of, the, duende, this, attempted, to, define, a, schema, of, artistic, inspiration, arguing, that, great, art, depends, upon, a, vivid, awareness, of, death, connection, with, a, nation, s, soil, and, an, acknowledgement, of, the, limitations, of, reason, as, well, as, returning, to, the, classical, roots, of, theatre, garc, a, lorca, also, turned, to, traditional, forms, in, poetry, his, last, poetic, work, sonetos, de, amor, oscuro, sonnets, of, dark, love, 1936, was, long, thought, to, have, been, inspired, by, his, passion, for, rafael, rodr, guez, rap, n, young, actor, and,
