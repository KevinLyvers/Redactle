at, all, mulberry, groves, in, south, china, were, ruined, by, his, army, leading, to, a, decline, in, silk, exports, along, the, maritime, silk, road, however, as, huang, chao, s, army, was, in, the, lingnan, region, his, soldiers, were, stricken, by, illnesses, and, some, 3, 40, died, his, key, subordinates, suggested, that, he, march, back, north, and, he, agreed, he, thus, made, rafts, at, gui,

and, attacked, e, prefecture, in, modern, wuhan, and, pillaged, the, 15, surrounding, prefectures, as, he, did, so, however, he, was, repeatedly, repelled, by, zhang, lin, as, a, result, of, zhang, s,

of, the, overall, operations, against, huang, replacing, wang, many, circuits, thus, sent, troops, to, huainan, with, his, forces, repeatedly, defeated, by, zhang, and, also, suffering, from, plagues, huang, then, stationed, at, xin, prefecture, in, modern, shangrao, decided, to, try, to, bribe, his, way, out, of, his, predicament, he, thus, submitted, much, gold, to, zhang, and, wrote, letters,

in, modern, xuzhou, jiangsu, and, yiwu, headquartered, in, modern, baoding, hebei, circuits, as, soon, as, he, returned, those, troops, however, huang, broke, off, negotiations, and, challenged, zhang, to, a, battle, gao, in, anger, ordered, zhang, to, engage, but, this, time, huang, decisively, defeated, zhang, in, spring, 880, and, killed, him, in, battle, throwing, gao, into, a, panic, huang, after, defeating, zhang, then, captured, xuan, prefecture, then, in, summer, 880, crossed, the, yangtze, river, north, at, caishi, in, modern, ma, anshan, anhui, and, put, the, huainan,

then, serving, as, an, officer, under, gao, suggested, that, gao, engage, huang, but, gao, was, terrified, of, engaging, huang, after, zhang, s, death, and, instead, sent, urgent, requests, for, aid, to, the, imperial, government, the, imperial, government, which, had, hoped, that, gao, would, be, successful, in, stopping, huang, was, very, disappointed, and, thrown, into, a, panic, itself, emperor, xizong, ordered, the, circuits, south, of, the, yellow, river, to, send, troops, to, yin, river, a, major, branch, of, the, shaying, river, to, block, off, huang, s, further, advance, and, also, sent, cao, and, qi, kerang, the, military, governor, of, taining, circuit, headquartered, in, modern, jining, shandong, to, intercept, huang, however, cao, was, only, given, 6, 000, men, and, although, he, fought, hard, he, was, ultimately, unable, to, stop, huang, s, 150, 000, men, at, this, point, a, mutiny, among, the, imperial, armies, further, ended, any, imperial, resistance, at, yin, river, this, occurred, as, some, 3, 000, ganhua, soldiers, were, heading, to, yin, river, to, participate, in, the, defense, operations, there, and, they, went, through, xu, prefecture, in, modern, xuchang, the, capital, of, zhongwu, circuit, despite, the, ganhua, soldiers, reputation, for, lack, of, discipline, xue, neng, the, military, governor, of, zhongwu, because, he, had, been, ganhua, s, military, governor, before, believed, that, they, would, be, obedient, to, him, so, he, allowed, them, to, stay, in, the, city, but, that, night, the, ganhua, soldiers, rioted, over, what, they, perceived, to, be, the, lack, of, supplies, given, to, them, xue, met, them, and, calmed, them, down, but, this, in, turn, caused, the, zhongwu, soldiers, and, the, populace, of, xu, prefecture, to, be, angry, at, his, lenient, treatment, of, them, the, zhongwu, officer, zhou, ji, himself, then, taking, zhongwu, soldiers, toward, yin, river, thus, turned, his, army, around, and, attacked, and, slaughtered, the, ganhua, soldiers, his, soldiers, also, killed, xue, and, xue, s, family, zhou, then, declared, himself, military, governor, qi, concerned, that, zhou, would, attack, him, withdrew, from, the, area, and, returned, to, taining, circuit, in, response, the, troops, that, other, circuits, had, stationed, at, yin, river, scattered, leaving, the, path, wide, open, for, huang, huang, thus, crossed, the, huai, river, north, and, it, was, said, that, starting, from, this, point, huang, s, army, stopped, pillaging, for, wealth, but, forced, more, young, men, into, the, army, to, increase, its, strength, as, winter, 880, began, huang, chao, headed, toward, luoyang, and, chang, an, and, issued, a, declaration, that, his, aim, was, to, capture, emperor, xizong, to, make, emperor, xizong, answer, for, his, crimes, qi, kerang, was, put, in, charge, of, making, a, final, attempt, to, stop, huang, from, reaching, luoyang, meanwhile, though, the, chancellors, doulu, zhuan, and, cui, hang, believing, that, imperial, forces, would, not, be, able, to, stop, huang, from, reaching, luoyang, and, chang, an, suggested, that, emperor, xizong, prepare, to, flee, to, xichuan, circuit, headquartered, in, modern, chengdu, sichuan, where, chen, jingxuan, the, brother, of, the, powerful, eunuch, tian, lingzi, was, military, governor, emperor, xizong, however, wanted, to, also, make, one, last, attempt, to, defend, tong, pass, between, luoyang, and, chang, an, and, therefore, sent, the, imperial, shence, army, officers, zhang, chengfan, wang, shihui, and, zhao, ke, whose, soldiers, were, ill, trained, and, ill, equipped, as, the, shence, army, soldiers, families, were, largely, wealthy, and, were, able, to, pay, the, poor, and, the, sick, to, fill, in, for, them, to, try, to, defend, it, meanwhile, luoyang, fell, quickly, and, qi, withdrew, to, tong, pass, as, well, and, submitted, an, emergency, petition, stating, that, his, troops, were, fatigued, hungry, and, without, supplies, with, no, apparent, imperial, response, huang, then, attacked, tong, pass, qi, and, zhang, initially, resisted, his, forces, for, more, than, a, day, but, thereafter, qi, s, troops, hungry, and, tired, scattered, and, fled, zhang, s, final, attempts, to, defend, tong, pass, were, futile, and, it, fell, meanwhile, tian, had, recruited, some, new, soldiers, who, were, also, ill, trained, but, relatively, well, equipped, and, sent, them, to, the, front, but, by, the, time, they, reached, there, tong, pass, had, already, fallen, and, the, troops, from, boye, army, and,

empress, while, making, shang, rang, zhao, zhang, and, the, tang, officials, cui, qiu, and, yang, xigu, chancellors, huang, initially, tried, to, simply, take, over, the, tang, imperial, mandate, as, he, ordered, that, the, tang, imperial, officials, of, the, fourth, rank, or, lower, in, tang, s, nine, rank, system, continue, to, remain, in, office, as, long, as, they, showed, submission, by, registering, with, zhao, removing, only, the, third, rank, or, above, officials, the, tang, officials, who, would, not, submit, were, executed, en, masse, huang, also, tried, to, persuade, tang, generals, throughout, the, circuits, to, submit, to, him, and, a, good, number, of, them, did, including, zhuge, shuang, whom, he, made, the, military, governor, of, heyang, circuit, headquartered,
