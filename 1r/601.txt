it, is, the, first, time, band, members, have, agreed, to, participate, in, a, biographical, documentary, led, zeppelin, s, music, was, rooted, in, the, blues, the, influence, of, american, blues, artists, such, as, muddy, waters, and, skip, james, was, particularly, apparent, on, their, first, two, albums, as, was, the, distinct, country, blues, style, of, howlin, wolf, there, were, tracks, structured, around, the, twelve, bar, blues, on, every, studio, album, except, for, one, and, the, blues, directly, and, indirectly, influenced, other, songs, both, musically, and, lyrically, the, band, were, also, strongly, influenced, by, the, music, of, the, british, celtic, and, american, folk, revivals, scottish, folk, guitarist, bert, jansch, helped, inspire, page, and, from, him, he, adapted, open, tunings, and, aggressive, strokes, into, his, playing, the, band, also, drew, on, a, wide, variety, of, genres, including, world, music, and, elements, of, early, rock, and, roll, jazz, country, funk, soul, and, reggae, particularly, on, houses, of, the, holy, and, the, albums, that, followed, the, material, on, the, first, two, albums, was, largely, constructed, out, of, extended, jams, of, blues, standards, and, folk, songs, this, method, led, to, the, mixing, of, musical, and, lyrical, elements, of, different, songs, and, versions, as, well, as, improvised, passages, to, create, new, material, but, would, lead, to, later, accusations, of, plagiarism, and, legal, disputes, over, copyright, usually, the, music, was, developed, first, sometimes, with, improvised, lyrics, that, might, then, be, rewritten, for, the, final, version, of, the, song, from, the, visit, to, bron, yr, aur, in, 1970, the, songwriting, partnership, between, page, and, plant, became, predominant, with, page, supplying, the, music, largely, via, his, acoustic, guitar, and, plant, emerging, as, the, band, s, chief, lyricist, jones, and, bonham, then, added, to, the, material, in, rehearsal, or, in, the, studio, as, a, song, was, developed, in, the, later, stages, of, the, band, s, career, page, took, a, back, seat, in, composition, and, jones, became, increasingly, important, in, producing, music, often, composed, on, the, keyboard, plant, would, then, add, lyrics, before, page, and, bonham, developed, their, parts, early, lyrics, drew, on, the, band, s, blues, and, folk, roots, often, mixing, lyrical, fragments, from, different, songs, many, of, the, band, s, songs, dealt, with, themes, of, romance, unrequited, love, and, sexual, conquest, which, were, common, in, rock, pop, and, blues, music, some, of, their, lyrics, especially, those, derived, from, the, blues, have, been, interpreted, as, misogynistic, particularly, on, led, zeppelin, iii, they, incorporated, elements, of, mythology, and, mysticism, into, their, music, which, largely, grew, out, of, plant, s, interest, in, legends, and, history, these, elements, were, often, taken, to, reflect, page, s, interest, in, the, occult, which, resulted, in, accusations, that, the, recordings, contained, subliminal, satanic, messages, some, of, which, were, said, to, be, contained, in, backmasking, these, claims, were, generally, dismissed, by, the, band, and, music, critics, the, pastoral, fantasies, in, plant, s, songwriting, were, inspired, by, the, landscape, of, the, black, country, region, and, j, r, r, tolkien, s, high, fantasy, novel, the, lord, of, the, rings, susan, fast, argues, that, as, plant, emerged, as, the, band, s, main, lyricist, the, songs, more, obviously, reflected, his, alignment, with, the, west, coast, counterculture, of, the, 1960s, in, the, later, part, of, the, band, s, career, plant, s, lyrics, became, more, autobiographical, and, less, optimistic, drawing, on, his, own, experiences, and, circumstances, according, to, musicologist, robert, walser, led, zeppelin, s, sound, was, marked, by, speed, and, power, unusual, rhythmic, patterns, contrasting, terraced, dynamics, singer, robert, plant, s, wailing, vocals, and, guitarist, jimmy, page, s, heavily, distorted, crunch, these, elements, mean, that, they, are, often, cited, as, one, of, the, originators, of, hard, rock, and, heavy, metal, and, they, have, been, described, as, the, definitive, heavy, metal, band, although, the, band, members, have, often, eschewed, the, label, led, zeppelin, together, with, deep, purple, and, black, sabbath, have, been, referred, to, as, the, unholy, trinity, of, british, hard, rock, and, heavy, metal, in, the, early, to, mid, seventies, part, of, this, reputation, depends, on, the, band, s, use, of, distorted, guitar, riffs, on, songs, like, whole, lotta, love, and, the, wanton, song, often, riffs, were, not, doubled, by, guitar, bass, and, drums, exactly, but, instead, there, were, melodic, or, rhythmic, variations, page, s, guitar, playing, incorporated, elements, of, the, blues, scale, with, those, of, eastern, music, plant, s, use, of, high, pitched, shrieks, has, been, compared, to, janis, joplin, s, vocal, technique, robert, christgau, found, him, integral, to, the, group, s, heavy, power, blues, aesthetic, functioning, as, a, mechanical, effect, similarly, to, page, s, guitar, parts, while, noting, plant, hints, at, real, feeling, on, some, of, their, acoustic, songs, christgau, believed, he, abandoned, traditional, blues, singing, s, emphasis, on, emotional, projection, in, favour, of, vocal, precision, and, dynamics, whether, he, is, mouthing, sexist, blues, cliches, or, running, through, one, of, the, band, s, half, audible, half, comprehensible, lyrics, about, chivalry, or, the, counter, culture, his, voice, is, devoid, of, feeling, like, the, tenors, and, baritones, of, yore, he, wants, his, voice, to, be, an, instrument, specifically, an, electric, guitar, bonham, s, drumming, was, noted, for, its, power, his, rapid, rolls, and, his, fast, beats, on, a, single, bass, drum, while, jones, basslines, have, been, described, as, melodic, and, his, keyboard, playing, added, a, classical, touch, to, the, band, s, sound, at, some, deep, level, led, zeppelin, s, music, is, about, the, relationship, between, humanity, and, technology, philosophically, the, band, prefers, humanity, pure, and, simple, but, in, practice, it, must, realize, its, humanity, technologically, that, seems, truer, than, most, good, time, pastoral, fantasies, robert, christgau, 1972, led, zeppelin, have, been, widely, viewed, as, a, hard, rock, band, although, christgau, regarded, them, as, art, rock, as, well, according, to, popular, music, scholar, reebee, garofalo, because, hip, critics, could, not, find, a, constructive, way, of, positioning, themselves, in, relation, to, led, zeppelin, s, ultra, macho, presentation, they, were, excluded, from, the, art, rock, category, despite, their, broad, range, of, influences, christgau, wrote, in, 1972, the, band, could, be, considered, art, rock, because, they, relate, to, rock, and, roll, not, organically, but, intellectually, idealising, the, amplified, beat, as, a, kind, of, formal, challenge, unlike, their, contemporaries, in, jethro, tull, and, yes, who, use, the, physical, compulsion, of, beat, and, volume, to, involve, the, mind, led, zeppelin, make, body, music, of, an, oddly, cerebral, cast, arousing, aggression, rather, than, sexuality, as, such, along, with, other, second, generation, english, hard, rock, bands, like, black, sabbath, and, mott, the, hoople, they, can, attract, both, intellectuals, and, working, class, youths, in, a, strange, potential, double, audience, years, later, in, through, the, out, door, s, tuneful, synthesizer, pomp, further, confirmed, for, christgau, they, were, an, art, rock, band, page, stated, that, he, wanted, led, zeppelin, to, produce, music, that, had, light, and, shade, this, began, to, be, more, clearly, realised, beginning, with, led, zeppelin, iii, which, made, greater, use, of, acoustic, instruments, this, approach, has, been, seen, as, exemplified, in, the, fourth, album, particularly, on, stairway, to, heaven, which, begins, with, acoustic, guitar, and, recorder, and, ends, with, drums, and, heavy, electric, sounds, towards, the, end, of, their, recording, career, they, moved, to, a, more, mellow, and, progressive, sound, dominated, by, jones, keyboard, motifs, they, also, increasingly, made, use, of, various, layering, and, production, techniques, including, multi, tracking, and, overdubbed, guitar, parts, their, emphasis, on, the, sense, of, dynamics, and, ensemble, arrangement, has, been, seen, as, producing, an, individualistic, style, that, transcends, any, single, music, genre, ian, peddie, argues, that, they, were, loud, powerful, and, often, heavy, but, their, music, was, also, humorous, self, reflective, and, extremely, subtle, many, have, considered, led, zeppelin, to, be, one, of, the, most, successful, innovative, and, influential, bands, in, the, history, of, rock, music, rock, critic, mikal, gilmore, said, led, zeppelin, talented, complex, grasping, beautiful, and, dangerous, made, one, of, the, most, enduring, bodies, of, composition, and, performance, in, twentieth, century, music, despite, everything, they, had, to, overpower, including, themselves, led, zeppelin, have, influenced, hard, rock, and, heavy, metal, bands, such, as, deep, purple, black, sabbath, rush, queen, scorpions, aerosmith, the, black, crowes, and, megadeth, as, well, as, progressive, metal, bands, like, tool, and, dream, theater, they, influenced, some, early, punk, and, post, punk, bands, among, them, the, ramones, joy, division, and, the, cult, they, were, also, an, important, influence, on, the, development, of, alternative, rock, as, bands, adapted, elements, from, the, zeppelin, sound, of, the, mid, 1970s, including, the, smashing, pumpkins, nirvana, pearl, jam, and, soundgarden, bands, and, artists, from, diverse, genres, have, acknowledged, the, influence, of, led, zeppelin, such, as, madonna, shakira, lady, gaga, kesha, and, katie, melua, led, zeppelin, have, been, credited, with, a, major, impact, on, the, nature, of, the, music, business, particularly, in, the, development, of, album, oriented, rock, aor, and, stadium, rock, in, 1988, john, kalodner, then, a, r, executive, of, geffen, records, remarked, that, in, my, opinion, next, to, the, beatles, they, re, the, most, influential, band, in, history, they, influence, the, way, music, is, on, records, aor, radio, concerts, they, set, the, standards, for, the, aor, radio, format, with, stairway, to, heaven, having, aor, hits, without, necessarily, having, top, 40, hits, they, re, the, ones, who, did, the, first, real, big, arena, concert, shows, consistently, selling, out, and, playing, stadiums, without, support, people, can, do, as, well, as, them, but, nobody, surpasses, them, andrew, loog, oldham, the, former, producer, and, manager, of, the, rolling, stones, commented, on, how, led, zeppelin, had, a, major, influence, on, the, record, business, and, the, way, rock, concerts, were, managed, and, presented, to, huge, audiences, in, 2007, they, were, a, featured, artist, in, the, stadium, rock, episode, of, the, bbc, vh1, series, seven, ages, of, rock, the, band, have, sold, over, 200, million, albums, worldwide, according, to, some, sources, while, others, state, that, they, have, sold, in, excess, of, 300, million, records, including, 111, 5, million, certified, units, in, the, united, states, according, to, the, recording, industry, association, of, america, led, zeppelin, are, the, third, highest, selling, band, the, fifth, highest, selling, music, act, in, the, us, and, one, of, only, four, acts, to, earn, five, or, more, diamond, albums, they, achieved, eight, consecutive, number, ones, on, the, uk, albums, chart, a, record, for, most, consecutive, uk, number, one, albums, shared, with, abba, led, zeppelin, remain, one, of, the, most, bootlegged, artists, in, the, history, of, rock, music, led, zeppelin, also, made, a, significant, cultural, impact, jim, miller, editor, of, rolling, stone, illustrated, history, of, rock, roll, argues, that, on, one, level, led, zeppelin, represents, the, final, flowering, of, the, sixties, psychedelic, ethic, which, casts, rock, as, passive, sensory,
