modest, petrovich, mussorgsky, russian, romanized, modest, petrovich, musorgsky, ipa, 21, march, 1839, 28, march, 1881, was, a, russian, composer, one, of, the, group, known, as, the, five, he, was, an, innovator, of, russian, music, in, the, romantic, period, he, strove, to, achieve, a, uniquely, russian, musical, identity, often, in, deliberate, defiance, of, the, established, conventions, of, western, music, many, of, his, works, were, inspired, by, russian, history, russian, folklore, and, other, national, themes, such, works, include, the, opera, boris, godunov, the, orchestral, tone, poem, night, on, bald, mountain, and, the, piano, suite, pictures, at, an, exhibition, for, many, years, mussorgsky, s, works, were, mainly, known, in, versions, revised, or, completed, by, other, composers, many, of, his, most, important, compositions, have, posthumously, come, into, their, own, in, their, original, forms, and, some, of, the, original, scores, are, now, also, available, the, spelling, and, pronunciation, of, the, composer, s, name, have, caused, some, confusion, the, family, name, derives, from, a, 15th, or, 16th, century, ancestor, roman, vasilyevich, monastyryov, who, appears, in, the, velvet, book, the, 17th, century, genealogy, of, russian, boyars, roman, vasilyevich, bore, the, nickname, musorga, from, greek, romanized, musurgos, meaning, music, maker, and, was, the, grandfather, of, the, first, mussorgsky, the, composer, could, trace, his, lineage, to, rurik, the, legendary, 9th, century, founder, of, the, rus, state, in, mussorgsky, family, documents, the, spelling, of, the, name, varies, musarskiy, muserskiy, muserskoy, musirskoy, musorskiy, and, musurskiy, the, baptismal, record, gives, the, composer, s, name, as, muserskiy, in, early, up, to, 1858, letters, to, mily, balakirev, the, composer, signed, his, name, musorskiy, o, the, g, made, its, first, appearance, in, a, letter, to, balakirev, in, 1863, mussorgsky, used, this, new, spelling, o, musorgskiy, to, the, end, of, his, life, but, occasionally, reverted, to, the, earlier, musorskiy, the, addition, of, the, g, to, the, name, was, likely, initiated, by, the, composer, s, elder, brother, filaret, to, obscure, the, resemblance, of, the, name, s, root, to, an, unsavory, russian, word, mussorgsky, apparently, did, not, take, the, new, spelling, seriously, and, played, on, the, rubbish, connection, in, letters, to, vladimir, stasov, and, to, stasov, s, family, routinely, signing, his, name, musoryanin, roughly, garbage, dweller, compare, dvoryanin, nobleman, the, first, syllable, of, the, name, originally, received, the, stress, i, e, m, s, r, skiy, and, does, so, to, this, day, in, russia, including, the, composer, s, home, district, the, mutability, of, the, second, syllable, vowel, in, the, versions, of, the, name, mentioned, above, gives, evidence, that, this, syllable, did, not, receive, the, stress, the, addition, of, the, g, and, the, accompanying, shift, in, stress, to, the, second, syllable, i, e, mu, s, rk, skiy, sometimes, described, as, a, polish, variant, was, supported, by, filaret, mussorgsky, s, descendants, until, his, line, ended, in, the, 20th, century, their, example, was, followed, by, many, influential, russians, such, as, fyodor, shalyapin, nikolay, golovanov, and, tikhon, khrennikov, who, perhaps, dismayed, that, the, great, composer, s, name, was, reminiscent, of, garbage, supported, the, erroneous, second, syllable, stress, that, has, also, become, entrenched, in, the, west, the, western, convention, of, doubling, the, first, s, which, is, not, observed, in, scholarly, literature, e, g, the, grove, dictionary, of, music, and, musicians, likely, arose, because, in, many, western, european, languages, a, single, intervocalic, s, often, becomes, voiced, to, z, as, in, music, unlike, in, slavic, languages, where, the, intervocalic, s, is, always, unvoiced, doubling, the, consonant, thus, reinforces, its, voiceless, sibilant, s, sound, modest, is, the, russian, form, of, the, name, modestus, which, means, moderate, or, restrained, in, late, latin, he, was, called, modinka, diminutive, form, with, the, stressed, o, by, his, close, friends, and, relatives, mussorgsky, was, born, in, karevo, toropets, uyezd, pskov, governorate, russian, empire, 400, km, 250, mi, south, of, saint, petersburg, his, wealthy, and, land, owning, family, the, noble, family, of, mussorgsky, is, reputedly, descended, from, the, first, ruthenian, ruler, rurik, through, the, sovereign, princes, of, smolensk, his, mother, julia, chirikova, 1813, 1865, was, the, daughter, of, a, comparatively, non, rich, nobleman, modest, s, paternal, grandmother, irina, used, to, be, a, serf, that, could, be, sold, without, land, in, his, grandfather, s, estate, at, age, six, mussorgsky, began, receiving, piano, lessons, from, his, mother, herself, a, trained, pianist, his, progress, was, sufficiently, rapid, that, three, years, later, he, was, able, to, perform, a, john, field, concerto, and, works, by, franz, liszt, for, family, and, friends, at, 10, he, and, his, brother, were, taken, to, saint, petersburg, to, study, at, the, elite, german, language, petrischule, st, peter, s, school, while, there, modest, studied, the, piano, with, anton, gerke, in, 1852, the, 12, year, old, mussorgsky, published, a, piano, piece, titled, porte, enseigne, polka, at, his, father, s, expense, mussorgsky, s, parents, planned, the, move, to, saint, petersburg, so, that, both, their, sons, would, renew, the, family, tradition, of, military, service, to, this, end, mussorgsky, entered, the, cadet, school, of, the, guards, at, age, 13, sharp, controversy, had, arisen, over, the, educational, attitudes, at, the, time, of, both, this, institute, and, its, director, a, general, sutgof, all, agreed, the, cadet, school, could, be, a, brutal, place, especially, for, new, recruits, more, tellingly, for, mussorgsky, it, was, likely, where, he, began, his, eventual, path, to, alcoholism, according, to, a, former, student, singer, and, composer, nikolai, kompaneisky, sutgof, was, proud, when, a, cadet, returned, from, leave, drunk, with, champagne, music, remained, important, to, him, however, sutgof, s, daughter, was, also, a, pupil, of, gerke, and, mussorgsky, was, allowed, to, attend, lessons, with, her, his, skills, as, a, pianist, made, him, much, in, demand, by, fellow, cadets, for, them, he, would, play, dances, interspersed, with, his, own, improvisations, in, 1856, mussorgsky, who, had, developed, a, strong, interest, in, history, and, studied, german, philosophy, graduated, from, the, cadet, school, following, family, tradition, he, received, a, commission, with, the, preobrazhensky, regiment, the, foremost, regiment, of, the, russian, imperial, guard, in, october, 1856, the, 17, year, old, mussorgsky, met, the, 22, year, old, alexander, borodin, while, both, men, served, at, a, military, hospital, in, saint, petersburg, the, two, were, soon, on, good, terms, borodin, later, remembered, his, little, uniform, was, spic, and, span, close, fitting, his, feet, turned, outwards, his, hair, smoothed, down, and, greased, his, nails, perfectly, cut, his, hands, well, groomed, like, a, lord, s, his, manners, were, elegant, aristocratic, his, speech, likewise, delivered, through, somewhat, clenched, teeth, interspersed, with, french, phrases, was, rather, precious, there, was, a, touch, though, very, moderate, of, foppishness, his, politeness, and, good, manners, were, exceptional, the, ladies, made, a, fuss, of, him, he, sat, at, the, piano, and, throwing, up, his, hands, coquettishly, played, with, extreme, sweetness, and, grace, etc, extracts, from, trovatore, traviata, and, so, on, and, around, him, buzzed, in, chorus, charmant, d, licieux, and, suchlike, i, met, modest, petrovich, three, or, four, times, at, popov, s, in, this, way, both, on, duty, and, at, the, hospital, more, portentous, was, mussorgsky, s, introduction, that, winter, to, alexander, dargomyzhsky, at, that, time, the, most, important, russian, composer, after, mikhail, glinka, dargomyzhsky, was, impressed, with, mussorgsky, s, pianism, as, a, result, mussorgsky, became, a, fixture, at, dargomyzhsky, s, soir, es, there, as, critic, vladimir, stasov, later, recalled, he, began, his, true, musical, life, over, the, next, two, years, at, dargomyzhsky, s, mussorgsky, met, several, figures, of, importance, in, russia, s, cultural, life, among, them, stasov, c, sar, cui, a, fellow, officer, and, mily, balakirev, balakirev, had, an, especially, strong, impact, within, days, he, took, it, upon, himself, to, help, shape, mussorgsky, s, fate, as, a, composer, he, recalled, to, stasov, because, i, am, not, a, theorist, i, could, not, teach, him, harmony, as, for, instance, rimsky, korsakov, now, teaches, it, i, explained, to, him, the, form, of, compositions, and, to, do, this, we, played, through, both, beethoven, symphonies, and, much, else, schumann, schubert, glinka, and, others, analyzing, the, form, up, to, this, point, mussorgsky, had, known, nothing, but, piano, music, his, knowledge, of, more, radical, recent, music, was, virtually, non, existent, balakirev, started, filling, these, gaps, in, mussorgsky, s, knowledge, in, 1858, within, a, few, months, of, beginning, his, studies, with, balakirev, mussorgsky, resigned, his, commission, to, devote, himself, entirely, to, music, he, also, suffered, a, painful, crisis, at, this, time, this, may, have, had, a, spiritual, component, in, a, letter, to, balakirev, the, young, man, referred, to, mysticism, and, cynical, thoughts, about, the, deity, but, its, exact, nature, will, probably, never, be, known, in, 1859, the, 20, year, old, gained, valuable, theatrical, experience, by, assisting, in, a, production, of, glinka, s, opera, a, life, for, the, tsar, on, the, glebovo, estate, of, a, former, singer, and, her, wealthy, husband, he, also, met, konstantin, lyadov, father, of, anatoly, lyadov, and, enjoyed, a, formative, visit, to, moscow, after, which, he, professed, love, of, everything, russian, mussorgsky, and, his, brother, were, also, inspired, by, the, gothic, script, they, were, using, an, m, personal, sign, instead, of, family, coat, of, arms, very, similar, to, the, symbols, of, the, early, rurikids, despite, this, epiphany, mussorgsky, s, music, leaned, more, toward, foreign, models, a, four, hand, piano, sonata, that, he, produced, in, 1860, contains, his, only, movement, in, sonata, form, nor, is, any, nationalistic, impulse, easily, discernible, in, the, incidental, music, for, vladislav, ozerov, s, play, oedipus, in, athens, on, which, he, worked, between, the, ages, of, 19, and, 22, and, then, abandoned, unfinished, or, in, the, intermezzo, in, modo, classico, for, piano, solo, revised, and, orchestrated, in, 1867, the, latter, was, the, only, important, piece, he, composed, between, december, 1860, and, august, 1863, the, reasons, for, this, probably, lie, in, the, painful, re, emergence, of, his, subjective, crisis, in, 1860, and, the, purely, objective, difficulties, which, resulted, from, the, emancipation, of, the, serfs, the, following, year, as, a, result, of, which, the, family, was, deprived, of, half, its, estate, and, mussorgsky, had, to, spend, a, good, deal, of, time, in, karevo, unsuccessfully, attempting, to, stave, off, their, looming, impoverishment, by, this, time, mussorgsky, had, freed, himself, from, the, influence, of, balakirev, and, was, largely, teaching, himself, in, 1863, he, began, an, opera, salammb, on, which, he, worked, between, 1863, and, 1866, before, losing, interest, in, the, project, during, this, period, he, returned, to, saint, petersburg, and, supported, himself, as, a, low, grade, civil, servant, while, living, in, a, six, man, commune, in, a, heady, artistic, and, intellectual, atmosphere, he, read, and, discussed, a, wide, range, of, modern, artistic, and, scientific, ideas, including, those, of, the, provocative, writer, chernyshevsky, known, for, the, bold, assertion, that, in, art, form, and, content, are, opposites, under, such, influences, he, came, more, and, more, to, embrace, the, idea, of, artistic, realism, and, all, that, it, entailed, whether, this, concerned, the, responsibility, to, depict, life, as, it, is, truly, lived, the, preoccupation, with, the, lower, strata, of, society, or, the, rejection, of, repeating, symmetrical, musical, forms, as, insufficiently, true, to, the, unrepeating, unpredictable, course, of, real, life, real, life, affected, mussorgsky, painfully, in, 1865, when, his, mother, died, at, this, point, the, composer, had, his, first, serious, bout, of, alcoholism, which, forced, him, to, leave, the, commune, to, stay, with, his, brother, the, 26, year, old, was, however, on, the, point, of, writing, his, first, realistic, songs, including, hopak, and, darling, savishna, both, of, them, composed, in, 1866, and, among, his, first, real, publications, the, following, year, the, year, 1867, was, also, the, one, in, which, he, finished, the, original, orchestral, version, of, his, night, on, bald, mountain, which, however, balakirev, criticised, and, refused, to, conduct, with, the, result, that, it, was, never, performed, during, mussorgsky, s, lifetime, mussorgsky, s, career, as, a, civil, servant, was, by, no, means, stable, or, secure, though, he, was, assigned, to, various, posts, and, even, received, a, promotion, in, these, early, years, in, 1867, he, was, declared, supernumerary, remaining, in, service, but, receiving, no, wages, decisive, developments, were, occurring, in, his, artistic, life, however, although, it, was, in, 1867, that, stasov, first, referred, to, the, kuchka, russian, lit, bunch, english, the, five, of, russian, composers, loosely, grouped, around, balakirev, mussorgsky, was, by, then, ceasing, to, seek, balakirev, s, approval, and, was, moving, closer, to, the, older, alexander, dargomyzhsky, inside, the, five, and, its, close, companions, mussorgsky, was, nicknamed, as, humour, balakirev, was, power, and, rimsky, korsakov, was, sincerity, since, 1866, dargomyzhsky, had, been, working, on, his, opera, the, stone, guest, a, version, of, the, don, juan, story, with, a, pushkin, text, that, he, declared, would, be, set, just, as, it, stands, so, that, the, inner, truth, of, the, text, should, not, be, distorted, and, in, a, manner, that, abolished, the, unrealistic, division, between, aria, and, recitative, in, favour, of, a, continuous, mode, of, syllabic, but, lyrically, heightened, declamation, somewhere, between, the, two, under, the, influence, of, this, work, and, the, ideas, of, georg, gottfried, gervinus, according, to, whom, the, highest, natural, object, of, musical, imitation, is, emotion, and, the, method, of, imitating, emotion, is, to, mimic, speech, mussorgsky, in, 1868, rapidly, set, the, first, eleven, scenes, of, nikolai, gogol, s, play, marriage, zhenitba, with, his, priority, being, to, render, into, music, the, natural, accents, and, patterns, of, the, play, s, naturalistic, and, deliberately, humdrum, dialogue, this, work, marked, an, extreme, position, in, mussorgsky, s, pursuit, of, naturalistic, word, setting, he, abandoned, it, unorchestrated, after, reaching, the, end, of, his, act, 1, and, though, its, characteristically, mussorgskyian, declamation, is, to, be, heard, in, all, his, later, vocal, music, the, naturalistic, mode, of, vocal, writing, more, and, more, became, merely, one, expressive, element, among, many, a, few, months, after, abandoning, zhenitba, the, 29, year, old, mussorgsky, was, encouraged, to, write, an, opera, on, the, story, of, boris, godunov, this, he, did, assembling, and, shaping, a, text, from, pushkin, s, play, and, karamzin, s, history, he, completed, the, large, scale, score, the, following, year, while, living, with, friends, and, working, for, the, forestry, department, in, 1871, however, the, finished, opera, was, rejected, for, theatrical, performance, apparently, because, of, its, lack, of, any, prima, donna, role, mussorgsky, set, to, work, producing, a, revised, and, enlarged, second, version, during, the, next, year, which, he, spent, sharing, rooms, with, rimsky, korsakov, he, made, changes, that, went, beyond, those, requested, by, the, theatre, in, this, version, the, opera, was, accepted, probably, in, may, 1872, and, three, excerpts, were, staged, at, the, mariinsky, theatre, in, 1873, it, is, often, asserted, that, in, 1872, the, opera, was, rejected, a, second, time, but, no, specific, evidence, for, this, exists, by, the, time, of, the, first, production, of, boris, godunov, in, february, 1874, mussorgsky, had, taken, part, in, the, ill, fated, mlada, project, in, the, course, of, which, he, had, made, a, choral, version, of, his, night, on, bald, mountain, and, had, begun, khovanshchina, though, far, from, being, a, critical, success, and, in, spite, of, receiving, only, a, dozen, or, so, performances, the, popular, reaction, in, favour, of, boris, made, this, the, peak, of, mussorgsky, s, career, from, this, peak, a, pattern, of, decline, became, increasingly, apparent, at, this, point, the, balakirev, circle, was, disintegrating, something, mussorgsky, was, especially, bitter, about, he, wrote, to, vladimir, stasov, he, mighty, handful, has, degenerated, into, soulless, traitors, in, drifting, away, from, his, old, friends, mussorgsky, had, been, seen, to, fall, victim, to, fits, of, madness, that, could, well, have, been, alcoholism, related, his, friend, viktor, hartmann, had, died, and, his, relative, and, recent, roommate, arseny, golenishchev, kutuzov, who, furnished, the, poems, for, the, song, cycle, sunless, and, would, go, on, to, provide, those, for, the, songs, and, dances, of, death, had, moved, away, to, get, married, mussorgsky, engaged, a, new, and, prominent, personal, private, physician, about, 1870, dr, george, leon, carrick, sometime, secretary, and, later, president, of, the, st, petersburg, physicians, society, and, a, cousin, of, sir, harry, lauder, while, mussorgsky, suffered, personally, from, alcoholism, it, was, also, a, behavior, pattern, considered, typical, for, those, of, mussorgsky, s, generation, who, wanted, to, oppose, the, establishment, and, protest, through, extreme, forms, of, behavior, one, contemporary, notes, an, intense, worship, of, bacchus, was, considered, to, be, almost, obligatory, for, a, writer, of, that, period, it, was, a, showing, off, a, pose, for, the, best, people, of, the, sixties, another, writes, talented, people, in, russia, who, love, the, simple, folk, cannot, but, drink, mussorgsky, spent, day, and, night, in, a, saint, petersburg, tavern, of, low, repute, the, maly, yaroslavets, accompanied, by, other, bohemian, dropouts, he, and, his, fellow, drinkers, idealized, their, alcoholism, perhaps, seeing, it, as, ethical, and, aesthetic, opposition, for, a, time, mussorgsky, was, able, to, maintain, his, creative, output, his, compositions, from, 1874, include, sunless, the, khovanshchina, prelude, and, the, piano, suite, pictures, at, an, exhibition, in, memory, of, hartmann, he, also, began, work, on, another, opera, based, on, gogol, the, fair, at, sorochyntsi, for, which, he, produced, another, choral, version, of, night, on, bald, mountain, in, the, years, that, followed, mussorgsky, s, decline, became, increasingly, steep, although, now, part, of, a, new, circle, of, eminent, personages, that, included, singers, medical, men, and, actors, he, was, increasingly, unable, to, resist, drinking, and, a, succession, of, deaths, among, his, closest, associates, caused, him, great, pain, at, times, however, his, alcoholism, would, seem, to, be, in, check, and, among, the, most, powerful, works, composed, during, his, last, six, years, are, the, four, songs, and, dances, of, death, his, civil, service, career, was, made, more, precarious, by, his, frequent, illnesses, and, absences, and, he, was, fortunate, to, obtain, a, transfer, to, a, post, in, the, office, of, government, control, where, his, music, loving, superior, treated, him, with, great, leniency, even, allowing, him, to, spend, three, months, touring, twelve, cities, as, a, singer, s, accompanist, in, 1879, the, decline, could, not, be, halted, however, in, 1880, he, was, finally, dismissed, from, government, service, aware, of, his, destitution, one, group, of, friends, organised, a, stipend, designed, to, support, the, completion, of, khovanshchina, another, group, organised, a, similar, fund, to, pay, him, to, complete, the, fair, at, sorochyntsi, however, neither, work, was, completed, although, khovanshchina, in, piano, score, with, only, two, numbers, uncomposed, came, close, to, being, finished, in, early, 1881, a, desperate, mussorgsky, declared, to, a, friend, that, there, was, nothing, left, but, begging, and, suffered, four, seizures, in, rapid, succession, mussorgsky, also, suffered, from, delirium, tremens, during, this, period, though, he, found, a, comfortable, room, in, a, good, hospital, and, for, several, weeks, even, appeared, to, be, rallying, the, situation, was, hopeless, repin, painted, the, famous, red, nosed, portrait, in, what, were, to, be, the, last, days, of, the, composer, s, life, a, week, after, his, 42nd, birthday, he, was, dead, he, was, interred, at, the, tikhvin, cemetery, of, the, alexander, nevsky, monastery, in, saint, petersburg, mussorgsky, like, others, of, the, five, was, perceived, as, an, extremist, by, the, emperor, and, much, of, his, court, this, may, have, been, the, reason, tsar, alexander, iii, personally, crossed, off, boris, godunov, from, the, list, of, proposed, pieces, for, the, imperial, opera, in, 1888, mussorgsky, s, works, while, strikingly, novel, are, stylistically, romantic, and, draw, heavily, on, russian, musical, themes, he, has, been, the, inspiration, for, many, russian, composers, including, most, notably, dmitri, shostakovich, in, his, late, symphonies, and, sergei, prokofiev, in, his, operas, in, 1868, 1869, he, composed, the, opera, boris, godunov, about, the, life, of, the, russian, tsar, but, it, was, rejected, by, the, mariinsky, opera, mussorgsky, thus, edited, the, work, making, a, final, version, in, 1874, the, early, version, is, considered, darker, and, more, concise, than, the, later, version, but, also, more, crude, nikolai, rimsky, korsakov, re, orchestrated, the, opera, in, 1896, and, revised, it, in, 1908, the, opera, has, also, been, revised, by, other, composers, notably, shostakovich, who, made, two, versions, one, for, film, and, one, for, stage, the, opera, khovanshchina, was, unfinished, and, unperformed, when, mussorgsky, died, but, it, was, completed, by, rimsky, korsakov, and, received, its, premiere, in, 1886, in, saint, petersburg, this, opera, too, was, revised, by, shostakovich, the, fair, at, sorochyntsi, another, opera, was, left, incomplete, at, his, death, but, a, dance, excerpt, the, gopak, is, frequently, performed, mussorgsky, s, most, imaginative, and, frequently, performed, work, is, the, cycle, of, piano, pieces, describing, paintings, in, sound, called, pictures, at, an, exhibition, this, composition, best, known, through, an, orchestral, arrangement, by, maurice, ravel, was, written, in, commemoration, of, his, friend, the, architect, viktor, hartmann, mussorgsky, s, single, movement, orchestral, work, night, on, bald, mountain, enjoyed, broad, popular, recognition, in, the, 1940s, when, it, was, featured, in, tandem, with, schubert, s, ave, maria, in, the, 1940, walt, disney, animated, film, fantasia, among, the, composer, s, other, works, are, a, number, of, songs, including, three, song, cycles, the, nursery, 1872, sunless, 1874, and, songs, and, dances, of, death, 1877, plus, mephistopheles, song, of, the, flea, and, many, others, important, early, recordings, of, songs, by, mussorgsky, were, made, by, tenor, vladimir, rosing, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, other, recordings, have, been, made, by, boris, christoff, between, 1951, and, 1957, and,

critical, of, mussorgsky, mussorgsky, you, very, rightly, call, a, hopeless, case, in, talent, he, is, perhaps, superior, to, all, the, but, his, nature, is, narrow, minded, devoid, of, any, urge, towards, self, perfection, blindly, believing, in, the, ridiculous, theories, of, his, circle, and, in, his, own, genius, in, addition, he, has, a, certain, base, side, to, his, nature, which, likes, coarseness, uncouthness, roughness, he, flaunts, his, illiteracy, takes, pride, in, his, ignorance, mucks, along, anyhow, blindly, believing, in, the, infallibility, of, his, genius, yet, he, has, flashes, of, talent, which, are, moreover, not, devoid, of, originality, western, perceptions, of, mussorgsky, changed, with, the, european, premiere, of, boris, godunov, in, 1908, before, the,
