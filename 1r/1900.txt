for, georgia, residents, financed, by, his, early, investments, in, coca, cola, and, general, motors, has, been, somewhat, tarnished, by, allegations, of, racism, and, violence, these, primarily, stem, from, a, couple, of, mostly, discredited, biographies, that, were, released, following, his, death, cobb, s, reputation, as, a, violent, man, was, exaggerated, by, his, first, biographer, sportswriter, al, stump, whose, stories, about, cobb, have, been, proven, as, sensationalized, and, largely, fictional, while, he, was, known, for, often, violent, conflicts, he, spoke, favorably, about, black, players, joining, the, major, leagues, and, was, a, well, known, philanthropist, cobb, was, born, in, 1886, in, narrows, georgia, a, small, unincorporated, rural, community, of, farmers,

infant, his, parents, moved, to, the, nearby, town, of, royston, where, he, grew, up, by, most, accounts, he, became, fascinated, with, baseball, as, a, child, and, decided, that, he, wanted, to, go, professional, one, day, his, father, was, vehemently, opposed, to, this, idea, but, by, his, teenage, years, he, was, trying, out, for, area, teams, he, played, his, first, years, in, organized, baseball, for, the, royston, rompers, the, semi, pro, royston, reds, and, the, augusta, tourists, of, the, south, atlantic, league, who, released, him, after, only, two, days, he, then, tried, out, for, the, anniston, alabama, based, anniston, steelers, of, the, semipro, tennessee, alabama, league, with, his, father, s, stern, admonition, ringing, in, his, ears, don, t, come, home, a, failure, after, joining, the, steelers, for, a, monthly, salary, of, 50, cobb, promoted, himself, by, sending, several, postcards, written, about, his, talents, under, different, aliases, to, grantland, rice, the, atlanta, journal, sports, editor, eventually, rice, wrote, a, small, note, in, the, journal, that, a, young, fellow, named, cobb, seems, to, be, showing, an, unusual, lot, of, talent, after, about, three, months, cobb, returned, to, the, tourists, and, finished, the, season, hitting, 237, in, 35, games, while, with, the, tourists, he, was, mentored, and, coached, by, george, leidy, who, emphasized, pinpoint, bunting, and, aggression, on, the, basepaths, in, august, 1905, the, management, of, the, tourists, sold, cobb, to, the, american, league, s, detroit, tigers, for, 750,

indicate, that, william, cobb, had, suspected, amanda, of, infidelity, and, was, sneaking, past, his, own, bedroom, window, to, catch, her, in, the, act, she, saw, the, silhouette, of, what, she, presumed, to, be, an, intruder, and, acting, in, self, defense, shot, and, killed, her, husband, amanda, cobb, was, charged, with, murder, and, released, on, a, 7, 000, recognizance, bond, she, was, acquitted, on, march, 31, 1906, ty, cobb, later, attributed, his, ferocious, play, to, his, late, father, saying, i, did, it, for, my, father, he, never, got, to, see, me, play, but, i, knew, he, was, watching, me, and, i, never, let, him, down, cobb, was, initiated, into, freemasonry, in, 1907, earning, the, 32nd, degree, in, 1912, in, 1911, cobb, moved, to, detroit, s, architecturally, significant, and, now, historically, protected, woodbridge, neighborhood, from, which, he, would, walk, with, his, dogs, to, the, ballpark, prior, to, games, the, victorian, duplex, in, which, cobb, lived, still, stands, three, weeks, after, his, mother, killed, his, father, cobb, debuted, in, center, field, for, the, detroit, tigers, on, august, 30, 1905, in, his, first, major, league, at, bat, he, doubled, off, jack, chesbro, of, the, new, york, highlanders, chesbro, had, won, 41, games, the, previous, season, cobb, was, 18, years, old, at, the, time, the, youngest, player, in, the, league, by, almost, a, year, although, he, hit, only, 240, in, 41, games, he, signed, a, 1, 500, contract, to, play, for, the, tigers, in, 1905, as, a, rookie, cobb, was, subject, to, severe, hazing, by, his, veteran, teammates, who, were, jealous, of, the, young, prospect, the, players, smashed, his, homemade, bats, nailed, his, cleats, in, the, clubhouse, doused, his, clothes, before, tying, knots, in, them, and, verbally, abused, him, cobb, later, attributed, his, hostile, temperament, to, this, experience, these, old, timers, turned, me, into, a, snarling, wildcat, tigers, manager, hughie, jennings, later, acknowledged, that, cobb, was, targeted, for, abuse, by, veteran, players, some, of, whom, sought, to, force, him, off, the, team, i, let, this, go, for, a, while, because, i, wanted, to, satisfy, myself, that, cobb, has, as, much, guts, as, i, thought, in, the, very, beginning, jennings, recalled, well, he, proved, it, to, me, and, i, told, the, other, players, to, let, him, alone, he, is, going, to, be, a, great, baseball, player, and, i, won, t, allow, him, to, be, driven, off, this, club, the, following, year, 1906, cobb, became, the, tigers, full, time, center, fielder, and, hit, 316, in, 98, games, setting, a, record, for, the, highest, batting, average, minimum, 310, plate, appearances, for, a, 19, year, old, later, bested, by, mel, ott, s, 322, average, in, 124, games, for, the, 1928, new, york, giants, he, never, hit, below, that, mark, again, after, being, moved, to, right, field, he, led, the, tigers, to, three, consecutive, american, league, pennants, in, 1907, 1908, and, 1909, detroit, would, lose, each, world, series, to, the, cubs, twice, and, then, the, pirates, however, cobb, s, postseason, numbers, were, far, below, his, career, standard, cobb, did, not, get, another, opportunity, to, play, on, a, pennant, winning, team, in, 1907, cobb, reached, first, and, then, stole, second, third, and, home, he, accomplished, the, feat, four, times, during, his, career, still, an, mlb, record, as, of, 2022, he, finished, the, 1907, season, with, a, league, leading, 350, batting, average, 212, hits, 49, steals, and, 119, runs, batted, in, rbi, at, age, 20, he, was, the, youngest, player, to, win, a, batting, championship, and, held, this, record, until, 1955, when, fellow, detroit, tiger, al, kaline, won, the, batting, title, while, twelve, days, younger, than, cobb, had, been, reflecting, on, his, career, in, 1930, two, years, after, retiring, he, told, grantland, rice, the, biggest, thrill, i, ever, got, came, in, a, game, against, the, athletics, in, 1907, the, athletics, had, us, beaten, with, rube, waddell, pitching, they, were, two, runs, ahead, in, the, 9th, inning, when, i, happened, to, hit, a, home, run, that, tied, the, score, this, game, went, 17, innings, to, a, tie, and, a, few, days, later, we, clinched, our, first, pennant, you, can, understand, what, it, meant, for, a, 20, year, old, country, boy, to, hit, a, home, run, off, the, great, rube, in, a, pennant, winning, game, with, two, outs, in, the, ninth, despite, great, success, on, the, field, cobb, was, no, stranger, to, controversy, off, it, as, described, in, smithsonian, in, 1907, during, spring, training, in, augusta, georgia, a, black, groundskeeper, named, bungy, cummings, whom, cobb, had, known, for, years, attempted, to, shake, cobb, s, hand, or, pat, him, on, the, shoulder, the, overly, familiar, greeting, infuriated, cobb, who, attacked, cummings, when, cummings, wife, tried, to, defend, him, cobb, allegedly, choked, her, the, assault, was, only, stopped, when, catcher, charles, boss, schmidt, knocked, cobb, out, however, aside, from, schmidt, s, statement, to, the, press, no, other, corroborating, witnesses, to, the, assault, on, cummings, ever, came, forward, and, cummings, himself, never, made, a, public, comment, about, it, author, charles, leerhsen, speculates, that, the, assault, on, cummings, and, his, wife, never, occurred, and, that, it, was, a, total, fabrication, by, schmidt, cobb, had, spent, the, previous, year, defending, himself, on, several, occasions, from, assaults, by, schmidt, with, schmidt, often, coming, out, of, nowhere, to, blindside, cobb, on, that, day, several, reporters, did, see, cummings, who, appeared, to, be, partially, under, the, influence, of, liquor, approach, cobb, and, shout, hello, carrie, the, meaning, of, which, is, unknown, and, go, in, for, a, hug, cobb, then, pushed, him, away, which, was, the, last, interaction, that, anyone, saw, between, cobb, and, cummings, shortly, thereafter, hearing, a, fight, several, reporters, came, running, and, found, cobb, and, schmidt, wrestling, on, the, ground, when, the, fight, was, broken, up, and, cobb, had, walked, away, schmidt, remained, behind, and, told, the, reporters, that, he, saw, cobb, assaulting, cummings, and, his, wife, and, had, intervened, leerhsen, speculates, that, this, was, just, another, one, of, schmidt, s, assaults, on, cobb, and, that, once, discovered, schmidt, made, up, a, story, that, made, him, sound, like, he, had, assaulted, cobb, for, a, noble, purpose, in, 1908, cobb, attacked, a, black, laborer, in, detroit, who, complained, when, cobb, stepped, into, freshly, poured, asphalt, cobb, was, found, guilty, of, battery, but, the, sentence, was, suspended, in, september, 1907, cobb, began, a, relationship, with, the, coca, cola, company, that, lasted, the, remainder, of, his, life, by, the, time, he, died, he, held, over, 20, 000, shares, of, stock, and, owned, bottling, plants, in, santa, maria, california, twin, falls, idaho, and, bend, oregon, he, was, also, a, celebrity, spokesman, for, the, product, in, the, offseason, between, 1907, and, 1908, cobb, negotiated, with, clemson, agricultural, college, of, south, carolina, offering, to, coach, baseball, there, for, 250, a, month, provided, that, he, did, not, sign, with, detroit, that, season, this, did, not, come, to, pass, however, the, following, season, the, tigers, finished, ahead, of, the, chicago, white, sox, for, the, pennant, cobb, again, won, the, batting, title, with, a, 324, average, but, detroit, suffered, another, loss, in, the, world, series, in, august, 1908, cobb, married, charlotte, charlie, marion, lombard, the, daughter, of, prominent, augustan, roswell, lombard, in, the, offseason, the, couple, lived, on, her, father, s, augusta, estate, the, oaks, until, they, moved, into, their, own, house, on, williams, street, in, november, 1913, the, tigers, won, the, al, pennant, again, in, 1909, during, that, world, series, cobb, s, last, he, stole, home, in, the, second, game, igniting, a, three, run, rally, but, that, was, the, high, point, for, him, finishing, with, a, lowly, 231, as, the, tigers, lost, to, honus, wagner, and, the, powerful, pirates, in, seven, games, although, he, performed, poorly, in, the, postseason, he, won, the, triple, crown, by, hitting, 377, with, 107, rbi, and, nine, home, runs, all, inside, the, park, thus, becoming, the, only, player, of, the, modern, era, to, lead, his, league, in, home, runs, in, a, season, without, hitting, a, ball, over, the, fence, in, the, same, season, charles, m, conlon, snapped, the, famous, photograph, of, a, grimacing, cobb, sliding, into, third, base, amid, a, cloud, of, dirt, which, visually, captured, the, grit, and, ferocity, of, his, playing, style, going, into, the, final, days, of, the, 1910, season, cobb, had, a, 004, lead, on, nap, lajoie, for, the, american, league, batting, title, the, prize, for, the, winner, of, the, title, was, a, chalmers, automobile, cobb, sat, out, the, final, two, games, to, preserve, his, average, lajoie, hit, safely, eight, times, in, a, doubleheader, but, six, of, those, hits, were, bunt, singles, later, it, was, rumored, that, the, opposing, manager, had, instructed, his, third, baseman, to, play, extra, deep, to, allow, lajoie, to, win, the, batting, race, over, the, generally, disliked, cobb, although, cobb, was, credited, with, a, higher, batting, average, it, was, later, discovered, in, the, 1970s, that, one, game, had, been, counted, twice, so, that, cobb, actually, lost, to, lajoie, as, a, result, of, the, incident, al, president, ban, johnson, was, forced, to, arbitrate, the, situation, he, declared, cobb, the, rightful, owner, of, the, title, but, car, company, president, hugh, chalmers, chose, to, award, one, to, both, cobb, and, lajoie, cobb, regarded, baseball, as, something, like, a, war, future, tiger, second, baseman, charlie, gehringer, said, every, time, at, bat, for, him, was, a, crusade, baseball, historian, john, thorn, said, in, the, book, legends, of, the, fall, he, is, testament, to, how, far, you, can, get, simply, through, will, cobb, was, pursued, by, demons, cobb, was, having, a, tremendous, year, in, 1911, which, included, a, 40, game, hitting, streak, still, shoeless, joe, jackson, led, him, by, 009, points, in, the, batting, race, late, in, the, season, near, the, end, of, the, season, cobb, s, tigers, had, a, long, series, against, jackson, s, cleveland, naps, fellow, southerners, cobb, and, jackson, were, personally, friendly, both, on, and, off, the, field, cobb, used, that, friendship, to, his, advantage, cobb, ignored, jackson, when, jackson, tried, to, say, anything, to, him, when, jackson, persisted, cobb, snapped, angrily, back, at, him, making, him, wonder, what, he, could, have, done, to, enrage, cobb, cobb, felt, that, it, was, these, mind, games, that, caused, jackson, to, fall, off, to, a, final, average, of, 408, twelve, points, lower, than, cobb, s, 420, a, 20th, century, record, which, stood, until, george, sisler, tied, it, and, rogers, hornsby, surpassed, it, with, 424, the, record, since, then, until, 2024, except, for, hugh, duffy, s, 438, in, the, 19th, century, i, often, tried, plays, that, looked, recklessly, daring, maybe, even, silly, but, i, never, tried, anything, foolish, when, a, game, was, at, stake, only, when, we, were, far, ahead, or, far, behind, i, did, it, to, study, how, the, other, team, reacted, filing, away, in, my, mind, any, observations, for, future, use, ty, cobb, in, the, new, york, times, cobb, led, the, al, that, year, in, numerous, other, categories, including, 248, hits, 147, runs, scored, 127, rbi, 83, stolen, bases, 47, doubles, 24, triples, and, a, 621, slugging, percentage, cobb, hit, eight, home, runs, but, finished, second, in, that, category, to, frank, baker, who, hit, eleven, he, was, awarded, another, chalmers, car, this, time, for, being, voted, the, al, mvp, by, the, baseball, writers, association, of, america, on, may, 12, 1911, playing, against, the, new, york, highlanders, he, scored, from, first, base, on, a, single, to, right, field, then, scored, another, run, from, second, base, on, a, wild, pitch, in, the, seventh, inning, he, tied, the, game, with, a, two, run, double, the, highlanders, catcher, vehemently, argued, the, safe, call, at, second, base, with, the, umpire, in, question, going, on, at, such, length, that, the, other, highlanders, infielders, gathered, nearby, to, watch, realizing, that, no, one, on, the, highlanders, had, called, time, cobb, strolled, unobserved, to, third, base, and, then, casually, walked, towards, home, plate, as, if, to, get, a, better, view, of, the, argument, he, then, suddenly, broke, into, a, run, and, slid, into, home, plate, for, the, eventual, winning, run, it, was, performances, like, this, that, led, branch, rickey, to, say, later, that, cobb, had, brains, in, his, feet, describing, his, gameplay, strategy, in, 1930, he, said, my, system, was, all, offense, i, believed, in, putting, up, a, mental, hazard, for, the, other, fellow, if, we, were, five, or, six, runs, ahead, i, d, try, some, wild, play, such, as, going, from, first, to, home, on, a, single, this, helped, to, make, the, other, side, hurry, the, play, in, a, close, game, later, on, i, worked, out, all, the, angles, i, could, think, of, to, keep, them, guessing, and, hurrying, in, the, same, interview, cobb, talked, about, having, noticed, a, throwing, tendency, of, first, baseman, hal, chase, but, having, to, wait, two, full, years, until, the, opportunity, came, to, exploit, it, by, unexpectedly, altering, his, own, baserunning, tendencies, he, was, able, to, surprise, chase, and, score, the, winning, run, of, the, game, in, question, on, may, 15, 1912, cobb, assaulted, a, heckler, claude, lucker, often, misspelled, as, lueker, in, the, stands, in, new, york, s, hilltop, park, where, the, tigers, were, playing, the, highlanders, lucker, described, by, baseball, historian, frank, russo, as, a, tammany, hall, lackey, and, two, bit, punk, often, berated, cobb, when, detroit, visited, new, york, in, this, game, the, two, traded, insults, through, the, first, couple, of, innings, cobb, at, one, point, went, to, the, highlander, dugout, to, look, for, the, highlanders, owner, to, try, to, have, lucker, ejected, from, the, game, but, his, search, was, in, vain, he, also, asked, for, the, police, to, intervene, but, they, refused, the, situation, climaxed, when, lucker, allegedly, called, cobb, a, half, nigger, cobb, in, his, discussion, of, the, incident, in, the, holmes, biography, avoided, such, explicit, words, but, alluded, to, lucker, s, epithet, by, saying, he, was, reflecting, on, my, mother, s, color, and, morals, he, went, on, to, state, that, he, warned, highlander, manager, harry, wolverton, that, if, something, was, not, done, about, that, man, there, would, be, trouble, no, action, was, taken, at, the, end, of, the, sixth, inning, after, being, challenged, by, teammates, sam, crawford, and, jim, delahanty, to, do, something, about, it, cobb, climbed, into, the, stands, and, attacked, lucker, who, it, turned, out, was, handicapped, he, had, lost, all, of, one, hand, and, three, fingers, on, his, other, hand, in, an, industrial, accident, some, onlookers, shouted, at, him, to, stop, because, the, man, had, no, hands, to, which, cobb, reportedly, retorted, i, don, t, care, if, he, got, no, feet, according, to, russo, the, crowd, cheered, cobb, on, in, the, fight, though, extremely, rare, in, the, 21st, century, attacking, fans, was, not, so, unusual, an, activity, in, the, early, years, of, baseball, other, notable, baseball, stars, who, assaulted, heckling, fans, include, babe, ruth, cy, young, rube, waddell, kid, gleason, sherry, magee, and, fred, clarke, the, league, suspended, him, his, teammates, though, not, fond, of, cobb, went, on, strike, to, protest, the, suspension, and, the, lack, of, protection, of, players, from, abusive, fans, before, the, may, 18, game, in, philadelphia, for, that, one, game, detroit, fielded, a, replacement, team, made, up, of, hastily, recruited, college, and, sandlot, players, plus, two, tiger, coaches, and, lost, 24, 2, thereby, setting, some, of, major, league, baseball, s, modern, era, post, 1900, negative, records, notably, the, 26, hits, in, a, nine, inning, game, allowed, by, allan, travers, who, pitched, one, of, the, sport, s, most, unlikely, complete, games, the, pre, 1901, record, for, the, most, hits, and, runs, given, up, in, a, game, is, held, by, the, cleveland, blues, dave, rowe, primarily, an, outfielder, rowe, pitched, a, complete, game, on, july, 24, 1882, giving, up, 35, runs, on, 29, hits, the, current, post, 1900, record, for, most, hits, in, a, nine, inning, game, is, 31, set, in, 1992, by, the, milwaukee, brewers, against, toronto, however, the, blue, jays, used, six, pitchers, the, strike, ended, when, cobb, urged, his, teammates, to, return, to, the, field, according, to, him, this, incident, led, to, the, formation, of, a, players, union, the, ballplayers, fraternity, formally, the, fraternity, of, professional, baseball, players, of, america, an, early, version, of, what, is, now, called, the, major, league, baseball, players, association, which, garnered, some, concessions, from, the, owners, during, his, career, cobb, was, involved, in, numerous, other, fights, both, on, and, off, the, field, and, several, profanity, laced, shouting, matches, for, example, cobb, and, umpire, billy, evans, arranged, to, settle, their, in, game, differences, through, fisticuffs, under, the, grandstand, after, the, game, members, of, both, teams, were, spectators, and, broke, up, the, scuffle, after, cobb, had, knocked, evans, down, pinned, him, and, began, choking, him, in, 1909, cobb, was, arrested, for, assault, for, an, incident, that, occurred, in, a, cleveland, hotel, cobb, got, into, an, argument, with, the, elevator, operator, around, 2, 15, a, m, when, the, man, refused, to, take, him, to, the, floor, where, some, of, his, teammates, were, having, a, card, game, the, elevator, operator, stated, that, he, could, only, take, cobb, to, the, floor, where, his, room, was, as, the, argument, escalated, a, night, watchman, approached, and, he, and, cobb, eventually, got, into, a, physical, confrontation, during, the, fight, cobb, produced, a, penknife, and, slashed, the, watchman, across, the, hand, cobb, later, claimed, that, the, watchman, who, had, the, upper, hand, in, the, fight, had, his, finger, in, cobb, s, left, eye, and, that, cobb, was, worried, he, was, going, to, have, his, sight, ruined, the, fight, finally, ended, when, the, watchman, produced, a, gun, and, struck, cobb, several, times, in, the, head, knocking, him, out, cobb, would, later, plead, guilty, to, simple, assault, and, pay, a, 100, fine, this, incident, has, often, been, retold, with, the, elevator, operator, and, the, watchman, both, being, black, however, recent, scholarship, has, shown, that, all, parties, involved, were, white, on, august, 13, 1912, the, same, day, the, tigers, were, to, play, the, new, york, highlanders, at, hilltop, park, cobb, and, his, wife, were, driving, to, a, train, station, in, syracuse, that, was, to, transport, him, to, the, game, when, three, intoxicated, men, had, stopped, him, on, the, way, when, cobb, had, gotten, out, of, the, car, to, confront, the, men, they, had, asked, for, money, and, instigated, a, physical, fight, with, cobb, defending, himself, from, one, of, the, men, by, punching, him, in, the, chin, as, another, had, fled, the, scene, after, being, grabbed, by, the, neck, by, another, man, the, man, had, pulled, a, knife, and, stabbed, him, in, the, back, before, he, forced, him, away, and, returned, to, his, car, to, continue, driving, to, the, station, for, the, game, cobb, refused, to, speak, any, further, of, the, issue, he, would, go, on, to, hit, 2, 3, with, two, singles, and, a, run, scored, as, well, as, batting, 418, the, tigers, lost, 2, 3, in, 1913, cobb, signed, a, contract, worth, 12, 000, for, the, six, month, season, equivalent, to, 369, 939, in, 2023, making, him, likely, the, first, baseball, player, in, history, to, be, paid, a, five, figure, salary, this, occurred, in, the, same, year, where, cobb, had, allegedly, grown, pessimistic, and, was, quoted, as, saying, it, seems, i, am, a, burden, to, the, detroit, club, as, a, trespasser, of, its, rules, if, that, be, the, case, let, mr, navin, put, a, price, on, me, and, i, ll, take, a, chance, on, being, able, to, negotiate, my, own, release, i, don, t, think, i, shall, ever, play, ball, again, this, is, positively, my, last, statement, in, this, matter, this, attributed, statement, was, first, published, on, an, april, 19, 1913, edition, of, the, los, angeles, herald, cobb, did, not, play, that, day, as, the, tigers, won, 4, 0, against, the, st, louis, browns, in, june, 1914, cobb, pleaded, guilty, to, disturbing, the, peace, after, pulling, a, revolver, during, an, argument, at, a, detroit, butcher, shop, he, was, fined, 50, equivalent, to, 1, 521, in, 2023, in, 1915, cobb, set, the, single, season, record, for, stolen, bases, with, 96, which, stood, until, dodger, maury, wills, broke, it, in, 1962, that, year, he, also, won, his, ninth, consecutive, batting, title, hitting, 369, during, 1917, spring, training, cobb, showed, up, late, for, a, dallas, spring, training, doubleheader, against, the, new, york, giants, because, of, a, golf, outing, several, of, the, giants, including, buck, herzog, called, him, names, from, the, bench, cobb, retaliated, by, spiking, herzog, during, the, second, game, prompting, a, bench, clearing, brawl, in, which, cobb, ground, herzog, s, face, in, the, dirt, the, dallas, police, department, had, to, help, stop, the, brawl, and, cobb, was, thrown, out, of, the, game, both, teams, were, staying, at, the, oriental, hotel, and, at, dinner, that, evening, herzog, walked, up, to, cobb, and, challenged, him, to, a, fight, the, two, met, an, hour, later, in, cobb, s, room, where, the, tiger, outfielder, had, prepared, for, the, fight, by, moving, furniture, out, of, the, way, and, pouring, water, on, the, floor, cobb, s, leather, soled, shoes, enabled, him, to, get, better, footing, than, herzog, who, wore, tennis, shoes, the, fight, lasted, for, thirty, minutes, over, the, course, of, which, cobb, knocked, down, herzog, about, six, times, while, herzog, only, knocked, cobb, down, once, the, scuffle, left, herzog, s, face, bloodied, and, his, eyes, nearly, shut, with, mcgraw, vowing, revenge, cobb, skipped, the, rest, of, the, exhibition, series, against, the, giants, heading, to, cincinnati, to, train, with, the, reds, who, were, managed, by, cobb, s, friend, christy, mathewson, however, cobb, later, expressed, the, deepest, respect, for, herzog, because, of, the, way, the, infielder, had, conducted, himself, in, the, fight, in, 1917, cobb, hit, in, 35, consecutive, games, still, the, only, player, with, two, 35, game, hitting, streaks, including, his, 40, game, streak, in, 1911, he, had, six, hitting, streaks, of, at, least, 20, games, in, his, career, second, only, to, pete, rose, s, eight, also, in, 1917, cobb, starred, in, the, motion, picture, somewhere, in, georgia, for, a, sum, of, 25, 000, plus, expenses, equivalent, to, approximately, 595, 000, today, based, on, a, story, by, sports, columnist, grantland, rice, the, film, casts, cobb, as, himself, a, small, town, georgia, bank, clerk, with, a, talent, for, baseball, broadway, critic, ward, morehouse, called, the, movie, absolutely, the, worst, flicker, i, ever, saw, pure, hokum, in, october, 1918, cobb, enlisted, in, the, chemical, corps, branch, of, the, united, states, army, and, was, sent, to, the, allied, expeditionary, forces, headquarters, in, chaumont, france, he, served, approximately, 67, days, overseas, before, being, honorably, discharged, and, returning, to, the, united, states, he, was, given, the, rank, of, captain, underneath, the, command, of, major, branch, rickey, the, president, of, the, st, louis, cardinals, other, baseball, players, serving, in, this, unit, included, captain, christy, mathewson, and, lieutenant, george, sisler, all, of, these, men, were, assigned, to, the, gas, and, flame, division, where, they, trained, soldiers, in, preparation, for, chemical, attacks, by, exposing, them, to, gas, chambers, in, a, controlled, environment, which, eventually, caused, mathewson, to, contract, the, tuberculosis, that, killed, him, on, the, eve, of, the, 1925, world, series, on, august, 19, 1921, in, the, second, game, of, a, doubleheader, against, elmer, myers, of, the, boston, red, sox, cobb, collected, his, 3, 000th, hit, aged, 34, at, the, time, he, is, still, the, youngest, ballplayer, to, reach, that, milestone, and, in, the, fewest, at, bats, 8, 093, by, 1920, babe, ruth, sold, to, the, renamed, new, york, yankees, from, the, boston, red, sox, had, established, himself, as, a, power, hitter, something, cobb, was, not, considered, to, be, when, his, tigers, showed, up, in, new, york, to, play, the, yankees, for, the, first, time, that, season, writers, billed, it, as, a, showdown, between, two, stars, of, competing, styles, of, play, ruth, hit, two, homers, a, triple, and, two, singles, during, the, series, compared, to, cobb, s, two, hits, of, a, double, and, a, single, as, ruth, s, popularity, grew, cobb, became, increasingly, hostile, toward, him, he, saw, the, babe, not, only, as, a, threat, to, his, style, of, play, but, also, to, his, style, of, life, perhaps, what, angered, him, the, most, about, ruth, was, that, despite, babe, s, total, disregard, for, his, physical, condition, and, traditional, baseball, he, was, still, an, overwhelming, success, and, brought, fans, to, the, ballparks, in, record, numbers, to, see, him, challenge, his, own, slugging, records, on, may, 5, 1925, cobb, told, a, reporter, that, for, the, first, time, in, his, career, he, was, going, to, try, to, hit, home, runs, saying, he, wanted, to, show, that, he, could, hit, home, runs, but, simply, chose, not, to, that, day, he, went, 6, for, 6, with, two, singles, a, double, and, three, homers, the, 16, total, bases, set, a, new, al, record, which, stood, until, may, 8, 2012, when, josh, hamilton, of, the, texas, rangers, hit, four, home, runs, and, a, double, for, a, total, of, 18, bases, the, next, day, cobb, had, three, more, hits, two, of, which, were, home, runs, the, single, his, first, time, up, gave, him, nine, consecutive, hits, over, three, games, while, his, five, homers, in, two, games, tied, the, record, set, by, cap, anson, of, the, old, chicago, nl, team, in, 1884, by, the, end, of, the, series, cobb, had, gone, 12, for, 19, with, 29, total, bases, and, afterwards, reverted, to, his, old, playing, style, even, so, when, asked, in, 1930, by, grantland, rice, to, name, the, best, hitter, he, d, ever, seen, cobb, answered, you, can, t, beat, the, babe, ruth, is, one, of, the, few, who, can, take, a, terrific, swing, and, still, meet, the, ball, solidly, his, timing, is, perfect, the, combined, power, and, eye, of, ruth, tigers, owner, frank, navin, tapped, cobb, to, take, over, for, hughie, jennings, as, manager, for, the, 1921, season, a, deal, he, signed, on, his, 34th, birthday, for, 32, 500, equivalent, to, approximately, 555, 168, in, today, s, terms, the, signing, surprised, the, baseball, world, although, cobb, was, a, legendary, player, he, was, disliked, throughout, the, baseball, community, even, by, his, own, teammates, the, closest, cobb, came, to, winning, another, pennant, was, in, 1924, when, the, tigers, finished, in, third, place, six, games, behind, the, pennant, winning, washington, senators, the, tigers, had, also, finished, third, in, 1922, but, 16, games, behind, the, yankees, cobb, blamed, his, lackluster, managerial, record, 479, wins, against, 444, losses, on, navin, who, was, arguably, even, more, frugal, than, he, was, passing, up, several, quality, players, cobb, wanted, to, add, to, the, team, in, fact, he, had, saved, money, by, hiring, cobb, to, both, play, and, manage, in, 1922, cobb, tied, a, batting, record, set, by, wee, willie, keeler, with, four, five, hit, games, in, a, season, this, has, since, been, matched, by, stan, musial, tony, gwynn, and, ichiro, suzuki, on, may, 10, 1924, cobb, was, honored, at, ceremonies, before, a, game, in, washington, d, c, by, more, than, 100, dignitaries, and, legislators, he, received, 21, books, one, for, each, year, in, professional, baseball, at, the, end, of, 1925, cobb, was, again, embroiled, in, a, batting, title, race, this, time, with, one, of, his, teammates, and, players, harry, heilmann, in, a, doubleheader, against, the, st, louis, browns, on, october, 4, 1925, heilmann, got, six, hits, to, lead, the, tigers, to, a, sweep, of, the, doubleheader, and, beat, cobb, for, the, batting, crown, 393, to, 389, cobb, and, browns, player, manager, george, sisler, each, pitched, in, the, final, game, cobb, pitching, a, perfect, inning, cobb, announced, his, retirement, after, a, 22, year, career, as, a, tiger, in, november, 1926, and, headed, home, to, augusta, georgia, shortly, thereafter, tris, speaker, also, retired, as, player, manager, of, the, cleveland, indians, the, retirement, of, two, great, players, at, the, same, time, sparked, some, interest, and, it, turned, out, that, the, two, were, coerced, into, retirement, because, of, allegations, of, game, fixing, brought, about, by, dutch, leonard, a, former, pitcher, managed, by, cobb, leonard, accused, former, pitcher, and, outfielder, smoky, joe, wood, and, cobb, of, betting, on, a, tigers, indians, game, played, in, detroit, on, september, 25, 1919, in, which, they, allegedly, orchestrated, a, tigers, victory, to, win, the, bet, leonard, claimed, proof, existed, in, letters, written, to, him, by, cobb, and, wood, commissioner, kenesaw, mountain, landis, held, a, secret, hearing, with, cobb, speaker, and, wood, a, second, secret, meeting, among, the, al, directors, led, to, the, unpublicized, resignations, of, cobb, and, speaker, however, rumors, of, the, scandal, led, judge, landis, to, hold, additional, hearings, in, which, leonard, refused, to, participate, cobb, and, wood, admitted, to, writing, the, letters, but, claimed, that, a, horse, racing, bet, was, involved, and, that, leonard, s, accusations, were, in, retaliation, for, cobb, s, having, released, him, from, the, tigers, thereby, demoting, him, to, the, minor, leagues, speaker, denied, any, wrongdoing, on, january, 27, 1927, judge, landis, cleared, cobb, and, speaker, of, any, wrongdoing, because, of, leonard, s, refusal, to, appear, at, the, hearings, landis, allowed, both, cobb, and, speaker, to, return, to, their, original, teams, but, each, team, let, them, know, that, they, were, free, agents, and, could, sign, with, any, club, they, wanted, speaker, signed, with, the, washington, senators, for, 1927, and, cobb, with, the, philadelphia, athletics, speaker, then, joined, cobb, in, philadelphia, for, the, 1928, season, cobb, said, he, had, come, back, only, to, seek, vindication, and, say, he, left, baseball, on, his, own, terms, cobb, played, regularly, in, 1927, for, a, young, and, talented, team, that, finished, second, to, one, of, the, greatest, teams, of, all, time, the, 110, 44, 1927, yankees, returning, to, detroit, to, a, tumultuous, welcome, on, may, 10, and, doubling, his, first, time, up, to, the, cheers, of, tigers, fans, on, july, 18, cobb, became, the, first, member, of, the, 4, 000, hit, club, when, he, doubled, off, former, teammate, sam, gibson, still, pitching, for, the, tigers, at, navin, field, cobb, returned, for, the, 1928, season, but, played, less, frequently, due, to, his, age, and, the, blossoming, abilities, of, the, young, a, s, who, were, again, in, a, pennant, race, with, the, yankees, on, september, 3, ty, cobb, pinch, hit, in, the, ninth, inning, of, the, first, game, of, a, doubleheader, against, the, senators, and, doubled, off, bump, hadley, for, his, last, career, hit, although, his, final, at, bats, were, not, until, september, 11, against, the, yankees, when, he, popped, out, off, hank, johnson, and, grounded, out, to, shortstop, mark, koenig, he, then, announced, his, retirement, effective, the, end, of, the, season, after, batting, 300, or, higher, in, 23, consecutive, seasons, the, only, season, under, 300, being, his, rookie, season, a, major, league, record, that, is, unlikely, to, be, broken, despite, not, being, known, as, a, slugger, he, led, the, al, in, slugging, percentage, eight, times, in, his, 11, seasons, from, 1907, to, 1917, he, also, ended, his, career, with, a, rather, dubious, record, when, cobb, retired, he, led, al, outfielders, for, most, errors, all, time, with, 271, which, still, stands, today, nineteenth, century, player, tom, brown, holds, the, major, league, record, with, 490, errors, committed, as, an, outfielder, while, the, national, league, record, is, held, by, 19th, century, player, george, gore, with, 346, errors, cobb, ranks, 14th, on, the, all, time, list, for, errors, committed, by, an, outfielder, cobb, retired, a, wealthy, and, successful, man, he, toured, europe, with, his, family, went, to, scotland, for, some, time, and, then, returned, to, his, farm, in, georgia, he, spent, his, retirement, pursuing, his, off, season, avocations, of, hunting, golfing, polo, and, fishing, his, other, pastime, was, trading, stocks, and, bonds, increasing, his, immense, personal, wealth, he, was, a, major, stockholder, in, the, coca, cola, corporation, which, by, itself, would, have, made, him, wealthy, in, the, winter, of, 1930, cobb, moved, into, a, spanish, ranch, estate, on, spencer, lane, in, the, affluent, town, of, atherton, located, south, of, san, francisco, california, on, the, san, francisco, peninsula, at, the, same, time, his, wife, charlie, filed, the, first, of, several, divorce, suits, but, withdrew, the, suit, shortly, thereafter, the, couple, eventually, divorced, in, 1947, after, 39, years, of, marriage, the, last, few, years, of, which, cobb, s, wife, lived, in, nearby, menlo, park, the, couple, had, three, sons, and, two, daughters, tyrus, raymond, jr, shirley, marion, herschel, roswell, james, howell, and, beverly, cobb, s, children, found, him, to, be, demanding, yet, also, capable, of, kindness, and, extreme, warmth, he, expected, his, sons, to, be, exceptional, athletes, in, general, and, baseball, players, in, particular, tyrus, raymond, jr, flunked, out, of, princeton, where, he, had, played, on, the, varsity, tennis, team, much, to, his, father, s, dismay, the, elder, cobb, traveled, to, the, princeton, campus, and, beat, his, son, with, a, whip, to, ensure, against, future, academic, failure, tyrus, raymond, jr, then, entered, yale, university, and, became, captain, of, the, tennis, team, while, improving, his, academics, but, was, then, arrested, twice, in, 1930, for, drunkenness, and, left, yale, without, graduating, cobb, helped, his, son, deal, with, his, pending, legal, problems, but, then, permanently, broke, off, with, him, even, though, tyrus, raymond, jr, finally, reformed, and, eventually, earned, an, m, d, from, the, medical, college, of, south, carolina, and, practiced, obstetrics, and, gynecology, in, dublin, georgia, until, his, death, at, 42, on, september, 9, 1952, from, a, brain, tumor, his, father, remained, distant, in, february, 1936, when, the, first, baseball, hall, of, fame, election, results, were, announced, cobb, had, been, named, on, 222, of, 226, ballots, outdistancing, babe, ruth, honus, wagner, christy, mathewson, and, walter, johnson, the, only, others, to, earn, the, necessary, 75, of, votes, to, be, elected, that, first, year, his, 98, 2, stood, as, the, record, until, tom, seaver, received, 98, 8, of, the, vote, in, 1992, those, results, show, that, although, many, people, disliked, him, personally, they, respected, the, way, he, had, played, and, what, he, had, accomplished, in, 1998, sporting, news, ranked, him, as, third, on, the, list, of, 100, greatest, baseball, players, of, major, league, stars, of, the, 1940s, and, 1950s, cobb, had, positive, things, to, say, about, stan, musial, phil, rizzuto, and, jackie, robinson, but, few, others, even, so, he, was, known, to, help, out, young, players, he, was, instrumental, in, helping, joe, dimaggio, negotiate, his, rookie, contract, with, the, new, york, yankees, according, to, sportswriter, grantland, rice, he, and, cobb, were, returning, from, the, masters, golf, tournament, in, the, late, 1940s, and, stopped, at, a, greenville, south, carolina, liquor, store, cobb, noticed, that, the, man, behind, the, counter, was, shoeless, joe, jackson, who, had, been, banned, from, baseball, almost, 30, years, earlier, following, the, black, sox, scandal, jackson, did, not, appear, to, recognize, him, and, after, making, his, purchase, an, incredulous, cobb, asked, don, t, you, know, me, joe, sure, i, know, you, ty, replied, jackson, but, i, wasn, t, sure, you, wanted, to, know, me, a, lot, of, them, don, t, cobb, was, mentioned, in, the, poem, line, up, for, yesterday, by, ogden, nash, c, is, for, cobb, who, grew, spikes, and, not, corn, and, made, all, the, basemen, wish, they, weren, t, born, ogden, nash, sport, magazine, january, 1949, in, 1949, at, the, age, of, 62, cobb, married, a, second, time, to, 40, year, old, frances, fairbairn, cass, a, divorc, e, from, buffalo, new, york, their, childless, marriage, ending, with, a, divorce, in, 1956, at, this, time, cobb, became, generous, with, his, wealth, donating, 100, 000, in, his, parents, name, for, his, hometown, to, build, a, modern, 24, bed, hospital, cobb, memorial, hospital, which, is, now, part, of, the, ty, cobb, healthcare, system, he, also, established, the, cobb, educational, fund, which, awarded, scholarships, to, needy, georgia, students, bound, for, college, by, endowing, it, with, a, 100, 000, donation, in, 1953, equivalent, to, approximately, 1, 138, 806, in, current, year, dollars, cobb, knew, that, another, way, he, could, share, his, wealth, was, by, having, biographies, written, that, would, both, set, the, record, straight, on, him, and, teach, young, players, how, to, play, john, mccallum, spent, some, time, with, cobb, to, write, a, combination, how, to, and, biography, titled, the, tiger, wore, spikes, an, informal, biography, of, ty, cobb, that, was, published, in, 1956, in, december, 1959, he, was, diagnosed, with, prostate, cancer, diabetes, high, blood, pressure, and, bright, s, disease, it, was, also, during, his, final, years, that, cobb, began, work, on, his, autobiography, my, life, in, baseball, the, true, record, with, writer, al, stump, cobb, retained, editorial, control, over, the, book, and, the, published, version, presented, him, in, a, positive, light, stump, said, that, the, collaboration, was, contentious, and, after, cobb, s, death, stump, published, two, more, books, and, a, short, story, giving, what, he, said, was, the, true, story, one, of, these, later, books, was, used, as, the, basis, for, the, 1994, film, cobb, a, box, office, flop, starring, tommy, lee, jones, as, cobb, and, directed, by, ron, shelton, in, 2010, an, article, by, william, r, ron, cobb, no, relation, in, the, peer, reviewed, the, national, pastime, the, official, publication, of, the, society, for, american, baseball, research, accused, stump, of, extensive, forgeries, of, cobb, related, documents, and, diaries, the, article, further, accused, stump, of, numerous, false, statements, about, cobb, in, his, last, years, most, of, which, were, sensationalistic, in, nature, and, intended, to, cast, cobb, in, an, unflattering, light, in, his, last, days, cobb, spent, some, time, with, the, old, movie, comedian, joe, e, brown, talking, about, the, choices, he, had, made, in, his, life, according, to, brown, cobb, said, he, felt, that, he, had, made, mistakes, and, that, he, would, do, things, differently, if, he, could, he, had, played, hard, and, lived, hard, all, his, life, had, no, friends, to, show, for, it, at, the, end, and,

see, him, was, to, remember, him, forever, george, sisler, the, historian, steven, elliott, tripp, has, explored, the, public, s, reaction, to, cobb, as, a, pioneer, sports, celebrity, and, a, player, fans, loved, to, hate, tripp, writes, that, cobb, was, both, loved, and, hated, as, a, representative, of, a, particular, kind, of, masculinity, on, the, field, inviting, male, spectators, to, participate, in, the, contest, through, taunts, directed, at, opposing, players, cobb, s, own, sense, of, manhood, according, to, tripp, was, a, product, of, his, southern, upbringing, that, prized, individualism, excitement, and, family, honor, russo, wrote, there, is, no, denying, that, cobb, ranks, as, one, of, baseball, s, greatest, players, if, not, the, game, s, fiercest, competitor, many, of, baseball, s, greatest, players, were, friends, with, cobb, mathewson, and, walter, johnson, were, some, of, his, closest, friends, others, included, joe, dimaggio, ted, williams, home, run, baker, and, eddie, collins, following, his, retirement, cobb, even, befriended, one, of, his, greatest, rivals, babe, ruth, whose, wife, claire, was, from, georgia, cobb, has, been, judged, by, some, historians, and, journalists, as, the, best, player, of, the, dead, ball, era, and, is, generally, seen, as, one, of, the, greatest, players, of, all, time, some, historians, including, wesley, fricks, dan, holmes, and, charles, leerhsen, have, defended, cobb, against, unfair, portrayals, of, him, in, popular, culture, since, his, death, a, noted, case, is, the, book, written, by, sportswriter, al, stump, in, the, months, after, cobb, died, in, 1961, stump, was, later, discredited, when, it, became, known, that, he, had, stolen, items, belonging, to, cobb, and, also, betrayed, the, access, cobb, gave, him, in, his, final, months, as, a, result, of, the, movie, cobb, which, starred, tommy, lee, jones, there, are, many, myths, surrounding, cobb, s, life, including, one, that, he, sharpened, his, spikes, to, inflict, wounds, on, opposing, players, this, accusation, was, common, for, many, decades, before, the, movie, was, released, writing, in, the, journal, of, american, culture, hunter, m, hampton, says, that, leerhsen, succeeds, in, debunking, the, myth, of, cobb, that, stump, created, but, he, spawned, a, new, myth, by, conflating, stump, s, shortcomings, to, depict, cobb, as, an, egalitarian, in, 1977, a, statue, of, ty, cobb, designed, by, the, sculptor, felix, de, weldon, was, installed, outside, the, atlanta, fulton, county, stadium, it, would, later, be, relocated, to, the, front, of, the, public, library, in, his, hometown, of, royston, in, 2017, stories, of, cobb, s, racial, intolerance, during, his, playing, days, were, embellished, and, falsified, by, his, biographers, al, stump, and, charles, alexander, recent, research, on, his, life, has, clarified, a, number, of, stories, about, cobb, despite, stories, that, cobb, refused, to, stay, at, the, same, hotel, as, babe, ruth, due, to, rumors, that, ruth, had, black, ancestry, five, years, after, jackie, robinson, broke, the, color, barrier, cobb, publicly, supported, blacks, and, whites, playing, baseball, together, adding, certainly, it, is, okay, for, them, to, play, i, see, no, reason, in, the, world, why, we, shouldn, t, compete, with, colored, athletes, as, long, as, they, conduct, themselves, with, politeness, and, gentility, let, me, say, also, that, no, white, man, has, the, right, to, be, less, of, a, gentleman, than, a, colored, man, in, my, book, that, goes, not, only, for, baseball, but, in, all, walks, of, life, using, even, stronger, language, cobb, told, the, sporting, news, in, 1952, that, the, negro, should, be, accepted, and, not, grudgingly, but, wholeheartedly, in, 1953, black, newspapers, cited, his, praise, for, brooklyn, dodgers, catcher, roy, campanella, who, cobb, said, was, among, the, all, time, best, catchers, in, baseball, following, campanella, s, accident, that, left, him, paralyzed, the, dodgers, staged, a, tribute, game, where, tens, of, thousands, of, spectators, silently, held, lit, matches, above, their, heads, cobb, wrote, the, dodgers, owner, to, show, appreciation, for, what, you, did, for, this, fine, man, cobb, also, stated, that, willie, mays, was, the, only, player, i, d, pay, money, to, see, in, the, obituaries, that, ran, in, the, black, press, following, cobb, s, death, he, was, praised, for, in, favor, of, racial, freedom, in, baseball, sam, crawford, and, ty, cobb, were, teammates, for, parts, of, thirteen, seasons, they, played, beside, each, other, in, right, and, center, field, and, crawford, followed, cobb, in, the, batting, order, year, after, year, despite, the, physical, closeness, the, two, had, a, complicated, relationship, initially, they, had, a, student, teacher, relationship, crawford, was, an, established, star, when, cobb, arrived, and, cobb, eagerly, sought, his, advice, the, student, teacher, relationship, gradually, changed, to, one, of, jealous, rivals, cobb, was, not, popular, with, his, teammates, and, as, cobb, became, the, biggest, star, in, baseball, crawford, was, unhappy, with, the, preferential, treatment, given, to, cobb, cobb, was, allowed, to, show, up, late, for, spring, training, and, was, given, private, quarters, on, the, road, perks, not, offered, to, crawford, the, competition, between, the, two, was, intense, crawford, recalled, that, if, he, went, three, for, four, on, a, day, when, cobb, went, hitless, cobb, would, turn, red, and, sometimes, walk, out, of, the, park, with, the, game, still, on, when, it, was, reported, that, nap, lajoie, had, won, the, batting, title, crawford, was, alleged, to, have, been, one, of, several, tigers, who, sent, a, telegram, to, lajoie, congratulating, him, on, beating, cobb, in, retirement, cobb, wrote, a, letter, to, a, writer, for, the, sporting, news, accusing, crawford, of, not, helping, in, the, outfield, and, of, intentionally, fouling, off, balls, when, cobb, was, stealing, a, base, crawford, learned, about, the, letter, in, 1946, and, accused, cobb, of, being, a, cheapskate, who, never, helped, his, teammates, he, said, that, cobb, had, not, been, a, very, good, fielder, so, he, blamed, me, crawford, denied, intentionally, trying, to, deprive, cobb, of, stolen, bases, insisting, that, cobb, had, dreamed, that, up, when, asked, about, the, feud, cobb, attributed, it, to, envy, he, felt, that, crawford, was, a, hell, of, a, good, player, but, he, was, second, best, on, the, tigers, and, hated, to, be, an, also, ran, cobb, biographer, richard, bak, noted, that, the, two, only, barely, tolerated, each, other, and, agreed, with, cobb, that, crawford, s, attitude, was, driven, by, cobb, s, having, stolen, crawford, s, thunder, although, they, may, not, have, spoken, to, each, other, cobb, and, crawford, developed, an, ability, to, communicate, non, verbally, with, looks, and, nods, on, the, base, paths, they, became, one, of, the, most, successful, double, steal, pairings, in, baseball, history, for, several, years, cobb, had, the, highest, batting, average, in, major, league, history, 366, in, cobb, s, time, major, league, records, were, kept, very, well, but, not, with, the, absolute, accuracy, seen, later, thus, for, many, years, cobb, s, lifetime, batting, average, was, reported, as, 367, but, rigorous, research, of, source, documents, late, 20th, century, found, that, this, is, wrong, as, some, games, had, been, reported, incorrectly, all, sources, with, standing, agree, that, cobb, s, lifetime, batting, average, is, 366, except, mlb, com, see, below, some, show, slightly, different, numbers, for, at, bats, and, hits, but, all, devolve, to, 366, sabr, the, society, for, american, baseball, research, seconded, by, john, thorn, and, pete, palmer, among, others, the, baseball, almanac, and, espn, credit, cobb, with, 4, 189, hits, in, 11, 434, at, bats, retrosheet, gives, cobb, the, same, number, of, hits, in, five, more, at, bats, 11, 439, and, baseball, reference, and, the, baseball, hall, of, fame, add, one, more, at, bat, 11, 440, all, of, these, round, to, 366, mlb, com, lists, cobb, s, lifetime, average, as, 367, 4, 191, hits, in, 11, 429, at, bats, the, number, that, had, been, reported, and, believed, true, from, cobb, s, retirement, until, the, late, 20th, century, other, pages, on, the, website, do, give, the, correct, value, according, to, former, baseball, commissioner, bowie, kuhn,

constitutes, a, certain, statute, of, limitation, as, to, recognizing, any, changes, according, to, retrosheet, cobb, recorded, 1, six, hit, game, 13, five, hit, games, and, 82, four, hit, games, in,
