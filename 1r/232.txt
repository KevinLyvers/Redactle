for, example, kabir, bijak, exists, in, two, major, recensions, the, most, in, depth, scholarly, analysis, of, various, versions, and, translations, are, credited, to, charlotte, vaudeville, the, 20th, century, french, scholar, on, kabir, there, are, 82, works, attributed, to, kabir, as, mentioned, in, kabir, and, the, kabir, panth, by, westcott, shyamsundar, das, himself, brought, to, light, two, marked, manuscripts, which, he, published, in, 1928, one, of, these, manuscripts, carried, the, date, 1504, and, the, other, 1824, kabir, s, poems, were, verbally, composed, in, the, 15th, century, and, transmitted, viva, voce, through, the, 17th, century, kabir, bijak, was, compiled, and, written, down, for, the, first, time, in, the, 17th, century, scholars, state, that, this, form, of, transmission, over, geography, and, across, generations, bred, change, interpolation, and, corruption, of, the, poems, furthermore, whole, songs, were, creatively, fabricated, and, new, couplets, inserted, by, unknown, authors, and, attributed, to, kabir, not, because, of, dishonesty, but, out, of, respect, for, him, and, the, creative, exuberance, of, anonymous, oral, tradition, found, in, indian, literary, works, scholars, have, sought, to, establish, poetry, that, truly, came, from, kabir, and, its, historicity, value, kabir, s, poems, can, be, found, in, a, wide, variety, of, publications, and, websites, but, the, discussion, of, authenticity, is, ongoing, it, seems, certain, that, minor, changes, will, have, occurred, through, the, centuries, and, it, is, also, possible, that, poems, written, by, others, have, been, attributed, to, kabir, rabindranath, tagore, s, english, translation, and, compilation, songs, of, kabir, was, first, published, in, 1915, and, has, been, a, classic, reprinted, and, circulated, particularly, in, the, west, one, critic, v, c, mishra, has, gone, so, far, as, to, suggest, that, only, six, of, its, hundred, poems, are, authentic, and, also, raises, the, question, of, whether, the, translator, projected, theological, perspectives, of, the, early, 20th, century, onto, kabir, the, same, essay, adds, that, the, presumed, unauthentic, poems, nevertheless, belong, to, the, bhakti, movement, in, medieval, india, and, may, have, been, composed, by, admirers, of, kabir, who, lived, later, according, to, linda, hess, some, modern, commentators, have, tried, to, present, kabir, as, a, synthesizer, of, hinduism, and, islam, but, the, picture, is, a, false, one, while, drawing, on, various, traditions, as, he, saw, fit, kabir, emphatically, declared, his, independence, from, both, the, major, religions, of, his, countrymen, vigorously, attacked, what, he, considered, the, follies, of, these, religions, and, tried, to, kindle, the, fire, of, a, similar, autonomy, and, courage, in, those, who, claimed, to, be, his, disciples, he, adopted, their, terminology, and, concepts, but, vigorously, criticized, them, both, he, questioned, the, need, for, any, holy, book, as, stated, in, kabir, granthavali, as, follows, reading, book, after, book, the, whole, world, died, and, none, ever, became, learned, but, understanding, the, root, matter, is, what, made, them, gain, the, knowledge, many, scholars, interpret, kabir, s, philosophy, to, be, questioning, the, need, for, religion, rather, than, attempting, to, propose, either, hindu, muslim, unity, or, an, independent, synthesis, of, a, new, religious, tradition, kabir, rejected, the, hypocrisy, and, misguided, rituals, evident, in, various, religious, practices, of, his, day, including, those, in, islam, and, hinduism, saints, i, ve, seen, both, ways, hindus, and, muslims, don, t, want, discipline, they, want, tasty, food, the, hindu, keeps, the, eleventh,

mocks, the, practice, of, praying, to, avatars, such, as, buddha, of, buddhism, by, asserting, don, t, call, the, master, buddha, he, didn, t, put, down, devils, kabir, urged, people, to, look, within, and, consider, all, human, beings, as, manifestation, of, god, s, living, forms, if, god, be, within, the, mosque, then, to, whom, does, this, world, belong, if, ram, be, within, the, image,

vaudeville, states, that, the, philosophy, of, kabir, and, other, sants, of, the, bhakti, movement, is, the, seeking, of, the, absolute, the, notion, of, this, absolute, is, nirguna, which, writes, vaudeville, is, same, as, the, upanishadic, concept, of, the, brahman, atman, and, the, monistic, advaita, interpretation, of, the, vedantic, tradition, which, denies, any, distinction, between, the, soul, and, god, and, urges, man, to, recognize, within, himself, his, true, divine, nature, vaudeville, notes, that, this, philosophy, of, kabir, and, other, bhakti, sants, is, self, contradictory, because, if, god, is, within, then, that, would, be, a, call, to, abolish, all, external, bhakti, this, inconsistency, in, kabir, s, teaching, may, have, been, differentiating, union, with, god, from, the, concept, of, merging, into, god, or, oneness, in, all, beings, alternatively, states, vaudeville, the, saguna, prema, bhakti, tender, devotion, may, have, been, prepositioned, as, the, journey, towards, self, realization, of, the, nirguna, brahman, a, universality, beyond, monotheism, david, n, lorenzen, and, adri, n, mu, oz, trace, these, ideas, of, god, in, kabir, s, philosophy, as, nirguna, brahman, to, those, in, adi, shankara, s, theories, on, advaita, vedanta, school, of, hinduism, albeit, with, some, differences, lorenzen, in, his, review, of, kabir, s, philosophy, and, poetry, writes, the, extent, to, which, kabir, borrowed, elements, from, islam, is, controversial, many, recent, scholars, have, argued, that, he, simply, rejected, islam, and, took, almost, all, his, ideas, and, beliefs, from, the, hindu, tradition, contemporary, kabir, panth, sadhus, make, roughly, the, same, argument, most, of, the, vocabulary, used, in, his, songs, and, verses, are, borrowed, directly, from, the, hindu, tradition, some, scholars, state, that, the, sexual, imagery, in, some, of, kabir, s, poems, reflect, a, mystic, sufi, islam, influence, wherein, kabir, inverts, the, traditional, sufi, representation, of, a, god, woman, and, devotee, man, longing, for, a, union, and, instead, uses, the, imagery, of, lord, husband, and, devotee, bride, other, scholars, in, contrast, state, that, it, is, unclear, if, sufi, ideas, influenced, bhakti, sants, like, kabir, or, it, was, vice, versa, suggesting, that, they, probably, co, developed, through, mutual, interaction, kabir, left, islam, states, ronald, mcgregor, kabir, nevertheless, criticized, practices, such, as, killing, and, eating, cows, by, muslims, in, a, manner, hindus, criticized, those, practices, we, have, searched, the, turaki, dharam, turk, s, religion, islam, these, teachers, throw, many, thunderbolts, recklessly, they, display, boundless, pride, while, explaining, their, own, aims, they, kill, cows, how, can, they, kill, the, mother, whose, milk, they, drink, like, that, of, a, wet, nurse, the, young, and, the, old, drink, milk, pudding, but, these, fools, eat, the, cow, s, body, these, morons, know, nothing, they, wander, about, in, ignorance, without, looking, into, one, s, heart, how, can, one, reach, paradise, kabir, s, couplets, suggest, he, was, persecuted, for, his, views, while, he, was, alive, he, stated, for, example, saints, i, see, the, world, is, mad, if, i, tell, the, truth, they, rush, to, beat, me, if, i, lie, they, trust, me, kabir, response, to, persecution, and, slander, was, to, welcome, it, he, called, the, slanderer, a, friend, expressed, gratefulness, for, the, slander, for, it, brought, him, closer, to, his, god, winand, callewaert, translates, a, poem, attributed, to, kabir, in, the, warrior, ascetic, dadupanthi, tradition, within, hinduism, as, follows, keep, the, slanderer, near, you, build, him, a, hut, in, your, courtyard, for, without, soap, or, water, he, will, scrub, your, character, clean, the, legends, about, kabir, describe, him, as, the, underdog, who, nevertheless, is, victorious, in, trials, by, a, sultan, a, brahmin, a, qazi, a, merchant, a, god, or, a, goddess, the, ideological, messages, in, the, legends, appealed, to, the, poor, and, oppressed, according, to, david, lorenzen, legends, about, kabir, reflect, a, protest, against, social, discrimination, and, economic, exploitation, they, present, the, perspective, of, the, poor, and, powerless, not, the, rich, and, powerful, however, many, scholars, doubt, that, these, legends, of, persecution, are, authentic, point, to, the, lack, of, any, corroborating, evidence, consider, it, unlikely, that, a, muslim, sultan, would, take, orders, from, hindu, brahmins, or, kabir, s, own, mother, demanded, that, the, sultan, punish, kabir, and, question, the, historicity, of, the, legends, on, kabir, kabir, literature, legacy, was, promoted,

that, recognises, him, as, its, founder, and, is, one, of, the, sant, mat, sects, this, community, was, founded, centuries, after, kabir, died, in, various, parts, of, india, over, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, its, members, known, as, kabir, panthis, are, estimated, to, be, around, 9, 6, million, they, are, spread, over, north, and, central, india, as, well, as, dispersed, with, the, indian, diaspora, across, the, world, up, from, 843, 171, in, the, 1901, census, there, are, two, temples, dedicated, to, kabir, located, in, benares, one, of, them, is, maintained, by, hindus, while, the, other, by, muslims, both, the, temples, practise, similar, forms, of, worship, where, his, songs, are, sung, daily, other, rituals, of, aarti, and, distributing, prasad, are, similar, to, other, hindu, temples, the, followers, of, kabir, are, vegetarians, and, abstain, from, alcohol, kabir, s, verses, were, incorporated, into, adi, granth, the, scripture, of, sikhism, with, verses, attributed, to, kabir, constituting, the, largest, non, sikh, contribution, some, scholars, state, kabir, s, ideas, were, one, of, the, many, influences, on, guru, nanak, who, went, on, to, found, sikhism, in, the, fifteenth, century, other, sikh, scholars, disagree, stating, there, are, differences, between, the, views, and, practices, of, kabir, and, nanak, harpreet, singh, quoting, hew, mcleod, states, in, its, earliest, stage, sikhism, was, clearly, a, movement, within, the, hindu, tradition, nanak, was, raised, a, hindu, and, eventually, belonged, to, the, sant, tradition, of, northern, india, a, movement, associated, with, the, noted, poet, and, mystic, kabir, surjit, singh, gandhi, disagrees, and, writes, guru, nanak, in, his, thought, pattern, as, well, as, in, action, model, was, fundamentally, different, from, kabir, and, for, that, matter, other, radical, bhaktas, or, saints, saint, has, been, erroneously, used, for, such, bhaktas, by, mcleod, hence, to, consider, kabir, as, an, influence, on, guru, nanak, is, wrong, both, historically, and, theologically, mcleod, places, guru, nanak, in, the, sant, tradition, that, included, kabir, and, states, that, their, fundamental, doctrines, were, reproduced, by, guru, nanak, js, grewal, contests, this, view, and, states, that, mcleod, s, approach, is, limiting, in, its, scope, because, mcleod, takes, into,
