wilhelm, maximilian, wundt, w, n, t, german, 16, august, 1832, 31, august, 1920, was, a, german, physiologist, philosopher, and, professor, one, of, the, fathers, of, modern, psychology, wundt, who, distinguished, psychology, as, a, science, from, philosophy, and, biology, was, the, first, person, ever, to, call, himself, a, psychologist, he, is, widely, regarded, as, the, father, of, experimental, psychology, in, 1879, at, the, university, of, leipzig, wundt, founded, the, first, formal, laboratory, for, psychological, research, this, marked, psychology, as, an, independent, field, of, study, he, also, established, the, first, academic, journal, for, psychological, research, philosophische, studien, from, 1883, to, 1903, followed, by, psychologische, studien, from, 1905, to, 1917, to, publish, the, institute, s, research, a, survey, published, in, american, psychologist, in, 1991, ranked, wundt, s, reputation, as, first, for, all, time, eminence, based, on, ratings, provided, by, 29, american, historians, of, psychology, william, james, and, sigmund, freud, were, ranked, a, distant, second, and, third, wundt, was, born, at, neckarau, baden, now, part, of, mannheim, on, 16, august, 1832, the, fourth, child, to, parents, maximilian, wundt, 1787, 1846, a, lutheran, minister, and, marie, frederike, n, e, arnold, 1797, 1868, two, of, wundt, s, siblings, died, in, childhood, his, brother, ludwig, survived, wundt, s, paternal, grandfather, was, friedrich, peter, wundt, 1742, 1805, professor, of, geography, and, pastor, in, wieblingen, when, wundt, was, about, six, years, of, age, his, family, moved, to, heidelsheim, then, a, small, medieval, town, in, baden, w, rttemberg, born, in, the, german, confederation, at, a, time, that, was, considered, very, economically, stable, wundt, grew, up, during, a, period, in, which, the, reinvestment, of, wealth, into, educational, medical, and, technological, development, was, commonplace, an, economic, striving, for, the, advancement, of, knowledge, catalyzed, the, development, of, a, new, psychological, study, method, and, facilitated, his, development, into, the, prominent, psychological, figure, he, is, today, wundt, studied, from, 1851, to, 1856, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, at, the, university, of, heidelberg, and, at, the, university, of, berlin, after, graduating, as, a, doctor, of, medicine, from, heidelberg, 1856, with, doctoral, advisor, karl, ewald, hasse, wundt, studied, briefly, with, johannes, peter, m, ller, before, joining, the, heidelberg, university, s, staff, becoming, an, assistant, to, the, physicist, and, physiologist, hermann, von, helmholtz, in, 1858, with, responsibility, for, teaching, the, laboratory, course, in, physiology, there, he, wrote, contributions, to, the, theory, of, sense, perception, 1858, 1862, in, 1864, he, became, associate, professor, for, anthropology, and, medical, psychology, and, published, a, textbook, about, human, physiology, however, his, main, interest, according, to, his, lectures, and, classes, was, not, in, the, medical, field, he, was, more, attracted, by, psychology, and, related, subjects, his, lectures, on, psychology, were, published, as, lectures, on, human, and, animal, psychology, in, 1863, 1864, wundt, applied, himself, to, writing, a, work, that, came, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, in, the, history, of, psychology, principles, of, physiological, psychology, in, 1874, this, was, the, first, textbook, that, was, written, pertaining, to, the, field, of, experimental, psychology, in, 1867, near, heidelberg, wundt, met, sophie, mau, 1844, 1912, she, was, the, eldest, daughter, of, the, kiel, theology, professor, heinrich, august, mau, and, his, wife, louise, n, e, von, rumohr, and, a, sister, of, the, archaeologist, august, mau, they, married, on, 14, august, 1872, in, kiel, the, couple, had, three, children, eleanor, 1876, 1957, who, became, an, assistant, to, her, father, in, many, ways, louise, called, lilli, 1880, 1884, and, max, wundt, 1879, 1963, who, became, a, philosophy, professor, in, 1875, wundt, was, promoted, to, professor, of, inductive, philosophy, in, zurich, and, in, 1875, wundt, was, made, professor, of, philosophy, at, the, university, of, leipzig, where, ernst, heinrich, weber, 1795, 1878, and, gustav, theodor, fechner, 1801, 1887, had, initiated, research, on, sensory, psychology, and, psychophysics, and, where, two, centuries, earlier, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, had, developed, his, philosophy, and, theoretical, psychology, which, strongly, influenced, wundt, s, intellectual, path, wundt, s, admiration, for, ernst, heinrich, weber, was, clear, from, his, memoirs, where, he, proclaimed, that, weber, should, be, regarded, as, the, father, of, experimental, psychology, i, would, rather, call, weber, the, father, of, experimental, psychology, it, was, weber, s, great, contribution, to, think, of, measuring, psychic, quantities, and, of, showing, the, exact, relationships, between, them, to, be, the, first, to, understand, this, and, carry, it, out, in, 1879, at, the, university, of, leipzig, wundt, opened, the, first, laboratory, ever, to, be, exclusively, devoted, to, psychological, studies, and, this, event, marked, the, official, birth, of, psychology, as, an, independent, field, of, study, the, new, lab, was, full, of, graduate, students, carrying, out, research, on, topics, assigned, by, wundt, and, it, soon, attracted, young, scholars, from, all, over, the, world, who, were, eager, to, learn, about, the, new, science, that, wundt, had, developed, the, university, of, leipzig, assigned, wundt, a, lab, in, 1876, to, store, equipment, he, had, brought, from, zurich, located, in, the, konvikt, building, many, of, wundt, s, demonstrations, took, place, in, this, laboratory, due, to, the, inconvenience, of, transporting, his, equipment, between, the, lab, and, his, classroom, wundt, arranged, for, the, construction, of, suitable, instruments, and, collected, many, pieces, of, equipment, such, as, tachistoscopes, chronoscopes, pendulums, electrical, devices, timers, and, sensory, mapping, devices, and, was, known, to, assign, an, instrument, to, various, graduate, students, with, the, task, of, developing, uses, for, future, research, in, experimentation, between, 1885, and, 1909, there, were, 15, assistants, in, 1879, wundt, began, conducting, experiments, that, were, not, part, of, his, course, work, and, he, claimed, that, these, independent, experiments, solidified, his, lab, s, legitimacy, as, a, formal, laboratory, of, psychology, though, the, university, did, not, officially, recognize, the, building, as, part, of, the, campus, until, 1883, the, laboratory, grew, and, encompassed, a, total, of, eleven, rooms, the, psychological, institute, as, it, became, known, eventually, moved, to, a, new, building, that, wundt, had, designed, specifically, for, psychological, research, the, list, of, wundt, s, lectures, during, the, winter, terms, of, 1875, 1879, shows, a, wide, ranging, programme, 6, days, a, week, on, average, 2, hours, daily, e, g, in, the, winter, term, of, 1875, psychology, of, language, anthropology, logic, and, epistemology, and, during, the, subsequent, summer, term, psychology, brain, and, nerves, as, well, as, physiology, cosmology, historical, and, general, philosophy, were, included, in, the, following, terms, wundt, was, responsible, for, an, extraordinary, number, of, doctoral, dissertations, between, 1875, and, 1919, 185, students, including, 70, foreigners, of, whom, 23, were, from, russia, poland, and, other, east, european, countries, and, 18, were, from, america, several, of, wundt,

was, derided, mid, century, in, the, united, states, because, of, a, lack, of, adequate, translations, misrepresentations, by, certain, students, and, behaviorism, s, polemic, with, wundt, s, program, wundt, retired, in, 1917, to, devote, himself, to, his, scientific, writing, according, to, wirth, 1920, over, the, summer, of, 1920, wundt, felt, his, vitality, waning, and, soon, after, his, eighty, eighth, birthday, he, died, a, gentle, death, on, the, afternoon, of, tuesday, august, 3, p, 1, wundt, is, buried, in, leipzig, s, south, cemetery, with, his, wife, sophie, and, their, daughters, lilli, and, eleanor, wundt, was, awarded, honorary, doctorates, from, the, universities, of, leipzig, and, g, ttingen, and, the, pour, le, m, rite, for, science, and, arts, he, was, nominated, three, times, for, the, nobel, prize, in, physiology, or, medicine, wundt, was, an, honorary, member, of, 12, scientific, organizations, or, societies, he, was, a, corresponding, member, of, 13, academies, in, germany, and, abroad, for, example, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1895, and, of, the, united, states, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1909, wundt, s, name, was, given, to, the, asteroid, vundtia, 635, wundt, was, initially, a, physician, and, a, well, known, neurophysiologist, before, turning, to, sensory, physiology, and, psychophysics, he, was, convinced, that, for, example, the, process, of, spatial, perception, could, not, solely, be, explained, on, a, physiological, level, but, also, involved, psychological, principles, wundt, founded, experimental, psychology, as, a, discipline, and, became, a, pioneer, of, cultural, psychology, he, created, a, broad, research, programme, in, empirical, psychology, and, developed, a, system, of, philosophy, and, ethics, from, the, basic, concepts, of, his, psychology, bringing, together, several, disciplines, in, one, person, wundt, s, epistemological, position, against, john, locke, and, english, empiricism, sensualism, was, made, clear, in, his, book, beitr, ge, zur, theorie, der, sinneswahrnehmung, contributions, on, the, theory, of, sensory, perception, published, in, 1862, by, his, use, of, a, quotation, from, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, on, the, title, page, nihil, est, in, intellectu, quod, non, fuerit, in, sensu, nisi, intellectu, ipse, leibniz, nouveaux, essais, 1765, livre, ii, des, id, es, chapitre, 1, 6, nothing, is, in, the, intellect, that, was, not, first, in, the, senses, except, the, intellect, itself, principles, that, are, not, present, in, sensory, impressions, can, be, recognised, in, human, perception, and, consciousness, logical, inferences, categories, of, thought, the, principle, of, causality, the, principle, of, purpose, teleology, the, principle, of, emergence, and, other, epistemological, principles, wundt, s, most, important, books, are, these, 22, volumes, cover, an, immense, variety, of, topics, on, examination, of, the, complete, works, however, a, close, relationship, between, wundt, s, theoretical, psychology, epistemology, and, methodology, can, be, seen, english, translations, are, only, available, for, the, best, known, works, principles, of, physiological, psychology, only, the, single, volume, 1st, ed, of, 1874, and, ethics, also, only, 1st, ed, of, 1886, wundt, s, work, remains, largely, inaccessible, without, advanced, knowledge, of, german, its, reception, therefore, is, still, greatly, hampered, by, misunderstandings, stereotypes, and, superficial, judgements, wilhelm, wundt, conducted, experiments, on, memory, which, would, be, considered, today, as, iconic, memory, short, term, memory, and, enactment, and, generation, effects, psychology, is, interested, in, the, current, process, i, e, the, mental, changes, and, functional, relationships, between, perception, cognition, emotion, and, volition, motivation, mental, psychological, phenomena, are, changing, processes, of, consciousness, they, can, only, be, determined, as, an, actuality, an, immediate, reality, of, an, event, in, the, psychological, experience, the, relationships, of, consciousness, i, e, the, actively, organising, processes, are, no, longer, explained, metaphysically, by, means, of, an, immortal, soul, or, an, abstract, transcendental, spiritual, principle, wundt, considered, that, reference, to, the, subject, subjektbezug, value, assessment, wertbestimmung, the, existence, of, purpose, zwecksetzung, and, volitional, acts, willenst, tigkeit, to, be, specific, and, fundamental, categories, for, psychology, he, frequently, used, the, formulation, the, human, as, a, motivated, and, thinking, subject, in, order, to, characterise, features, held, in, common, with, the, humanities, and, the, categorical, difference, to, the, natural, sciences, influenced, by, leibniz, wundt, introduced, the, term, psychophysical, parallelism, as, follows, wherever, there, are, regular, relationships, between, mental, and, physical, phenomena, the, two, are, neither, identical, nor, convertible, into, one, another, because, they, are, per, se, incomparable, but, they, are, associated, with, one, another, in, the, way, that, certain, mental, processes, regularly, correspond, to, certain, physical, processes, or, figuratively, expressed, run, parallel, to, one, another, although, the, inner, experience, is, based, on, the, functions, of, the, brain, there, are, no, physical, causes, for, mental, changes, leibniz, wrote, souls, act, according, to, the, laws, of, final, causes, through, aspirations, ends, and, means, bodies, act, according, to, the, laws, of, efficient, causes, i, e, the, laws, of, motion, and, these, two, realms, that, of, efficient, causes, and, that, of, final, causes, harmonize, with, one, another, monadology, paragraph, 79, wundt, follows, leibniz, and, differentiates, between, a, physical, causality, natural, causality, of, neurophysiology, and, a, mental, psychic, causality, of, the, consciousness, process, both, causalities, however, are, not, opposites, in, a, dualistic, metaphysical, sense, but, depend, on, the, standpoint, causal, explanations, in, psychology, must, be, content, to, seek, the, effects, of, the, antecedent, causes, without, being, able, to, derive, exact, predictions, using, the, example, of, volitional, acts, wundt, describes, possible, inversion, in, considering, cause, and, effect, ends, and, means, and, explains, how, causal, and, teleological, explanations, can, complement, one, another, to, establish, a, co, ordinated, consideration, wundt, s, position, differed, from, contemporary, authors, who, also, favoured, parallelism, instead, of, being, content, with, the, postulate, of, parallelism, he, developed, his, principles, of, mental, causality, in, contrast, to, the, natural, causality, of, neurophysiology, and, a, corresponding, methodology, there, are, two, fundamentally, different, approaches, of, the, postulated, psychophysical, unit, not, just, two, points, of, view, in, the, sense, of, gustav, theodor, fechner, s, identity, hypothesis, psychological, and, physiological, statements, exist, in, two, categorically, different, reference, systems, the, important, categories, are, to, be, emphasised, in, order, to, prevent, category, mistakes, as, discussed, by, nicolai, hartmann, in, this, regard, wundt, created, the, first, genuine, epistemology, and, methodology, of, empirical, psychology, the, term, philosophy, of, science, did, not, yet, exist, apperception, is, wundt, s, central, theoretical, concept, leibniz, described, apperception, as, the, process, in, which, the, elementary, sensory, impressions, pass, into, self, consciousness, whereby, individual, aspirations, striving, volitional, acts, play, an, essential, role, wundt, developed, psychological, concepts, used, experimental, psychological, methods, and, put, forward, neuropsychological, modelling, in, the, frontal, cortex, of, the, brain, system, in, line, with, today, s, thinking, apperception, exhibits, a, range, of, theoretical, assumptions, on, the, integrative, process, of, consciousness, the, selective, control, of, attention, is, an, elementary, example, of, such, active, cognitive, emotional, and, motivational, integration, the, fundamental, task, is, to, work, out, a, comprehensive, development, theory, of, the, mind, from, animal, psychology, to, the, highest, cultural, achievements, in, language, religion, and, ethics, unlike, other, thinkers, of, his, time, wundt, had, no, difficulty, connecting, the, development, concepts, of, the, humanities, in, the, spirit, of, friedrich, hegel, and, johann, gottfried, herder, with, the, biological, theory, of, evolution, as, expounded, by, charles, darwin, wundt, determined, that, psychology, is, an, empirical, science, co, ordinating, natural, science, and, humanities, and, that, the, considerations, of, both, complement, one, another, in, the, sense, that, only, together, can, they, create, for, us, a, potential, empirical, knowledge, he, claimed, that, his, views, were, free, of, metaphysics, and, were, based, on, certain, epistemological, presuppositions, including, the, differentiation, of, subject, and, object, in, the, perception, and, the, principle, of, causality, with, his, term, critical, realism, wundt, distinguishes, himself, from, other, philosophical, positions, wundt, set, himself, the, task, of, redefining, the, broad, field, of, psychology, between, philosophy, and, physiology, between, the, humanities, and, the, natural, sciences, in, place, of, the, metaphysical, definition, as, a, science, of, the, soul, came, the, definition, based, on, scientific, theory, of, empirical, psychology, as, a, psychology, of, consciousness, with, its, own, categories, and, epistemological, principles, psychology, examines, the, entire, experience, in, its, immediately, subjective, reality, the, task, of, psychology, is, to, precisely, analyse, the, processes, of, consciousness, to, assess, the, complex, connections, psychische, verbindungen, and, to, find, the, laws, governing, such, relationships, wundt, s, concepts, were, developed, during, almost, 60, years, of, research, and, teaching, that, led, him, from, neurophysiology, to, psychology, and, philosophy, the, interrelationships, between, physiology, philosophy, logic, epistemology, and, ethics, are, therefore, essential, for, an, understanding, of, wundt, s, psychology, the, core, of, wundt, s, areas, of, interest, and, guiding, ideas, can, already, be, seen, in, his, vorlesungen, ber, die, menschen, und, tierseele, lectures, on, human, and, animal, psychology, of, 1863, individual, psychology, now, known, as, general, psychology, i, e, areas, such, as, perception, attention, apperception, volition, will, feelings, and, emotions, cultural, psychology, wundt, s, v, lkerpsychologie, as, development, theory, of, the, human, mind, animal, psychology, and, neuropsychology, the, initial, conceptual, outlines, of, the, 30, year, old, wundt, 1862, 1863, led, to, a, long, research, program, to, the, founding, of, the, first, institute, and, to, the, treatment, of, psychology, as, a, discipline, as, well, as, to, a, range, of, fundamental, textbooks, and, numerous, other, publications, during, the, heidelberg, years, from, 1853, to, 1873, wundt, published, numerous, essays, on, physiology, particularly, on, experimental, neurophysiology, a, textbook, on, human, physiology, 1865, 4th, ed, 1878, and, a, manual, of, medical, physics, 1867, he, wrote, about, 70, reviews, of, current, publications, in, the, fields, of, neurophysiology, and, neurology, physiology, anatomy, and, histology, a, second, area, of, work, was, sensory, physiology, including, spatial, perception, visual, perception, and, optical, illusions, an, optical, illusion, described, by, him, is, called, the, wundt, illusion, a, variant, of, the, hering, illusion, it, shows, how, straight, lines, appear, curved, when, seen, against, a, set, of, radiating, lines, as, a, result, of, his, medical, training, and, his, work, as, an, assistant, to, hermann, von, helmholtz, wundt, knew, the, benchmarks, of, experimental, research, as, well, as, the, speculative, nature, of, psychology, in, the, mid, 19th, century, wundt, s, aspiration, for, scientific, research, and, the, necessary, methodological, critique, were, clear, when, he, wrote, of, the, language, of, ordinary, people, who, merely, invoked, their, personal, experiences, of, life, criticized, naive, introspection, or, quoted, the, influence, of, uncritical, amateur, folk, psychology, on, psychological, interpretation, his, beitr, ge, zur, theorie, der, sinneswahrnehmung, 1862, shows, wundt, s, transition, from, a, physiologist, to, an, experimental, psychologist, why, does, not, psychology, follow, the, example, of, the, natural, sciences, it, is, an, understanding, that, from, every, side, of, the, history, of, the, natural, sciences, informs, us, that, the, progress, of, every, science, is, closely, connected, with, the, progress, made, regarding, experimental, methods, with, this, statement, however, he, will, in, no, way, treat, psychology, as, a, pure, natural, science, though, psychologists, should, learn, from, the, progress, of, methods, in, the, natural, sciences, there, are, two, sciences, that, must, come, to, the, aid, of, general, psychology, in, this, regard, the, development, history, of, the, mind, and, comparative, psychology, the, grundz, ge, der, physiologischen, psychologie, main, features, of, physiological, psychology, on, general, psychology, is, wundt, s, best, known, textbook, he, wanted, to, connect, two, sciences, with, one, another, physiology, provides, information, on, all, phenomena, of, life, that, can, be, perceived, using, our, external, senses, in, psychology, humans, examine, themselves, as, it, were, from, within, and, look, for, the, connections, between, these, processes, to, explain, which, of, them, represent, this, inner, observation, with, sufficient, certainty, the, approach, can, indeed, be, seen, as, well, founded, that, nothing, takes, place, in, our, consciousness, that, does, not, have, its, physical, basis, in, certain, physiological, processes, wundt, believed, that, physiological, psychology, had, the, following, task, firstly, to, investigate, those, life, processes, that, are, centrally, located, between, external, and, internal, experience, which, make, it, necessary, to, use, both, observation, methods, simultaneously, external, and, internal, and, secondly, to, illuminate, and, where, possible, determine, a, total, view, of, human, existence, from, the, points, of, view, gained, from, this, investigation, the, attribute, physiological, is, not, saying, that, it, wants, to, reduce, the, psychology, to, physiology, which, i, consider, impossible, but, that, it, works, with, physiological, i, e, experimental, tools, and, indeed, more, so, than, is, usual, in, other, psychology, takes, into, account, the, relationship, between, mental, and, physical, processes, if, one, wants, to, treat, the, peculiarities, of, the, method, as, the, most, important, factor, then, our, science, as, experimental, psychology, differs, from, the, usual, science, of, the, soul, purely, based, on, self, observation, after, long, chapters, on, the, anatomy, and, physiology, of, the, nervous, system, the, grundz, ge, 1874, has, five, sections, the, mental, elements, mental, structure, interactions, of, the, mental, structure, mental, developments, the, principles, and, laws, of, mental, causality, through, his, insistence, that, mental, processes, were, analysed, in, their, elements, wundt, did, not, want, to, create, a, pure, element, psychology, because, the, elements, should, simultaneously, be, related, to, one, another, he, describes, the, sensory, impression, with, the, simple, sensory, feelings, perceptions, and, volitional, acts, connected, with, them, and, he, explains, dependencies, and, feedbacks, wundt, rejected, the, widespread, association, theory, according, to, which, mental, connections, learning, are, mainly, formed, through, the, frequency, and, intensity, of, particular, processes, his, term, apperception, psychology, means, that, he, considered, the, creative, conscious, activity, to, be, more, important, than, elementary, association, apperception, is, an, emergent, activity, that, is, both, arbitrary, and, selective, as, well, as, imaginative, and, comparative, in, this, process, feelings, and, ideas, are, images, apperceptively,

processed, but, also, creatively, synthesised, see, below, on, the, principle, of, creative, synthesis, in, the, integrative, process, of, conscious, activity, wundt, sees, an, elementary, activity, of, the, subject, i, e, an, act, of, volition, to, deliberately, move, content, into, the, conscious, insofar, that, this, emergent, activity, is, typical, of, all, mental, processes, it, is, possible, to, describe, his, point, of, view, as, voluntaristic, wundt, describes, apperceptive, processes, as, psychologically, highly, differentiated, and, in, many, regards, bases, this, on, methods, and, results, from, his, experimental, research, one, example, is, the, wide, ranging, series, of, experiments, on, the, mental, chronometry, of, complex, reaction, times, in, research, on, feelings, certain, effects, are, provoked, while, pulse, and, breathing, are, recorded, using, a, kymograph, the, observed, differences, were, intended, to, contribute, towards, supporting, wundt, s,

johann, gottfried, herder, johann, friedrich, herbart, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, and, wilhelm, von, humboldt, with, his, ideas, about, comparative, linguistics, the, psychologist, moritz,

which, gave, this, field, its, name, wundt, 1888, critically, analysed, the, in, his, view, still, disorganised, intentions, of, lazarus, and, steinthal, and, limited, the, scope, of, the, issues, by,

as, culture, and, history, vol, 10, the, methodology, of, cultural, psychology, was, mainly, described, later, in, logik, 1921, wundt, worked, on, psychologically, linked, and, structured, an, immense, amount, of, material, the, topics, range, from, agriculture, and, trade, crafts, and, property, through, gods, myths, and, christianity, marriage, and, family, peoples, and, nations, to, self, education, and, self, awareness, science, the, world, and, humanity, wundt, recognized, about, 20, fundamental, dynamic, motives, in, cultural, development, motives, frequently, quoted, in, cultural, development, are, division, of, labour, ensoulment, salvation, happiness, production, and, imitation, child, raising, artistic, drive, welfare, arts, and, magic, adornment, guilt, punishment, atonement, self, education, play, and, revenge, other, values, and, motives, emerge, in, the, areas, of, freedom, and, justice, war, and, peace, legal, structures, state, structures, and, forms, of, government, also, regarding, the, development, of, a, world, view, of, culture, religion, state, traffic, and, a, worldwide, political, and, social, society, in, religious, considerations, many, of, the, values, and, motives, i, e, belief, in, soul, immortality, belief, in, gods, and, demons, ritualistic, acts, witchcraft, animism, and, totemism, are, combined, with, the, motives, of, art, imagination, dance, and, ecstasy, as, well, as, with, forms, of, family, and, power, wundt, saw, examples, of, human, self, education, in, walking, upright, physical, facilities, and, an, interaction, in, part, forced, upon, people, by, external, conditions, and, in, part, the, result, of, voluntary, culture, he, described, the, random, appearance, and, later, conscious, control, of, fire, as, a, similar, interaction, between, two, motives, in, the, interaction, of, human, activity, and, the, conditions, of, nature, he, saw, a, creative, principle, of, culture, right, from, the, start, tools, as, cultural, products, of, a, second, nature, an, interactive, system, of, cause, and, effect, a, system, of, purposes, and, thus, values, and, reflexively, from, standards, of, one, s, own, activities, is, formed, according, to, the, principles, of, one, s, own, thinking, in, the, elemente, der, v, lkerpsychologie, the, elements, of, cultural, psychology, 1912, wundt, sketched, out, four, main, levels, of, cultural, development, primitive, man, the, totemistic, age, the, age, of, heroes, and, gods, and, the, development, of, humanity, the, delineations, were, unclear, and, the, depiction, was, greatly, simplified, only, this, book, was, translated, into, english, elements, of, folk, psychology, thus, providing, but, a, much, abridged, insight, into, wundt, s, differentiated, cultural, psychology, the, folk, psychology, part, of, the, title, already, demonstrates, the, low, level, of, understanding, in, retrospect, v, lkerpsychologie, was, an, unfortunate, choice, of, title, because, it, is, often, misinterpreted, as, ethnology, wundt, also, considered, calling, it, social, anthropology, social, psychology, and, community, psychology, the, term, kulturpsychologie, would, have, been, more, fitting, though, psychological, development, theory, of, the, mind, would, have, expressed, wundt, s, intentions, even, better, the, intellectual, potential, and, heuristics, of, wundt, s, cultural, psychology, are, by, no, means, exhausted, wundt, contributed, to, the, state, of, neuropsychology, as, it, existed, at, the, time, in, three, ways, through, his, criticism, of, the, theory, of, localisation, then, widespread, in, neurology, through, his, demand, for, research, hypotheses, founded, on, both, neurological, and, psychological, thinking, and, through, his, neuropsychological, concept, of, an, apperception, centre, in, the, frontal, cortex, wundt, considered, attention, and, the, control, of, attention, an, excellent, example, of, the, desirable, combination, of, experimental, psychological, and, neurophysiological, research, wundt, called, for, experimentation, to, localise, the, higher, central, nervous, functions, to, be, based, on, clear, psychologically, based, research, hypotheses, because, the, questions, could, not, be, rendered, precisely, enough, on, the, anatomical, and, physiological, levels, alone, wundt, based, his, central, theory, of, apperception, on, neuropsychological, modelling, from, the, 3rd, edition, of, the, grundz, ge, onwards, according, to, this, the, hypothetical, apperception, centre, in, the, frontal, cerebral, cortex, that, he, described, could, interconnect, sensory, motor, autonomic, cognitive, emotional, and, motivational, process, components, wundt, thus, provided, the, guiding, principle, of, a, primarily, psychologically, oriented, research, programme, on, the, highest, integrative, processes, he, is, therefore, a, forerunner, of, current, research, on, cognitive, and, emotional, executive, functions, in, the, prefrontal, cerebral, cortex, and, on, hypothetical, multimodal, convergence, zones, in, the, network, of, cortical, and, limbic, functions, this, concept, of, an, interdisciplinary, neuroscience, is, now, taken, for, granted, but, wundt, s, contribution, towards, this, development, has, almost, been, forgotten, c, s, sherrington, repeatedly, quotes, wundt, s, research, on, the, physiology, of, the, reflexes, in, his, textbook, but, not, wundt, s, neuropsychological, concepts, given, its, position, between, the, natural, sciences, and, the, humanities, psychology, really, does, have, a, great, wealth, of, methodological, tools, while, on, the, one, hand, there, are, the, experimental, methods, on, the, other, hand, objective, works, and, products, in, cultural, development, objektivationen, des, menschlichen, geistes, also, offer, up, abundant, material, for, comparative, psychological, analysis, psychology, is, an, empirical, science, and, must, endeavor, to, achieve, a, systematic, procedure, examination, of, results, and, criticism, of, its, methodology, thus, self, observation, must, be, trained, and, is, only, permissible, under, strict, experimental, control, wundt, decisively, rejects, naive, introspection, wundt, provided, a, standard, definition, of, psychological, experiments, his, criticism, of, immanuel, kant, wundt, 1874, had, a, major, influence, kant, had, argued, against, the, assumption, of, the, measurability, of, conscious, processes, and, made, a, well, founded, if, very, short, criticism, of, the, methods, of, self, observation, regarding, method, inherent, reactivity, observer, error, distorting, attitudes, of, the, subject, and, the, questionable, influence, of, independently, thinking, people, but, wundt, expressed, himself, optimistic, that, methodological, improvements, could, be, of, help, here, he, later, admitted, that, measurement, and, mathematics, were, only, applicable, for, very, elementary, conscious, processes, statistical, methods, were, also, of, only, limited, value, for, example, in, psychophysics, or, in, the, evaluation, of, population, statistics, experimental, psychology, in, leipzig, mainly, lent, on, four, methodological, types, of, assessment, the, impression, methods, with, their, various, measurement, techniques, in, psychophysics, the, reaction, methods, for, chronometry, in, the, psychology, of, apperception, the, reproduction, methods, in, research, on, memory, and, the, expression, methods, with, observations, and, psychophysiological, measurement, in, research, on, feelings, wundt, considered, the, methodology, of, his, linguistic, psychological, investigations, vols, 1, and, 2, of, v, lkerpsychologie, to, be, the, most, fruitful, path, to, adequate, psychological, research, on, the, thought, process, the, principles, of, his, cultural, psychological, methodology, were, only, worked, out, later, these, involved, the, analytical, and, comparative, observation, of, objective, existing, materials, i, e, historical, writings, language, works, art, reports, and, observations, of, human, behaviour, in, earlier, cultures, and, more, rarely, direct, ethnological, source, material, wundt, differentiated, between, two, objectives, of, comparative, methodology, individual, comparison, collected, all, the, important, features, of, the, overall, picture, of, an, observation, material, while, generic, comparison, formed, a, picture, of, variations, to, obtain, a, typology, rules, of, generic, comparison, and, critical, interpretation, are, essentially, explained, in, his, logik, we, therefore, generally, describe, the, epitome, of, the, methods, as, interpretation, that, is, intended, to, provide, us, with, an, understanding, of, mental, processes, and, intellectual, creation, wundt, clearly, referred, to, the, tradition, of, humanistic, hermeneutics, but, argued, that, the, interpretation, process, basically, also, followed, psychological, principles, interpretation, only, became, the, characteristic, process, of, the, humanities, through, criticism, it, is, a, process, that, is, set, against, interpretation, to, dismantle, the, interaction, produced, through, psychological, analysis, it, examines, external, or, internal, contradictions, it, should, evaluate, the, reality, of, intellectual, products, and, is, also, a, criticism, of, values, and, a, criticism, of, opinions, the, typical, misconceptions, of, the, intellectualistic, individualistic, and, unhistorical, interpretation, of, intellectual, processes, all, have, their, source, in, the, habitually, coarse, psychology, based, on, subjective, assessment, what, is, meant, by, these, principles, is, the, simple, prerequisites, of, the, linking, of, psychological, facts, that, cannot, be, further, extrapolated, the, system, of, principles, has, several, repeatedly, reworked, versions, with, corresponding, laws, of, development, for, cultural, psychology, wundt, 1874, 1894, 1897, 1902, 1903, 1920, 1921, wundt, mainly, differentiated, between, four, principles, and, explained, them, with, examples, that, originate, from, the, physiology, of, perception, the, psychology, of, meaning, from, apperception, research, emotion, and, motivation, theory, and, from, cultural, psychology, and, ethics, in, addition, to, these, four, principles, wundt, explained, the, term, of, intellectual, community, and, other, categories, and, principles, that, have, an, important, relational, and, insightful, function, wundt, demands, co, ordinated, analysis, of, causal, and, teleological, aspects, he, called, for, a, methodologically, versatile, psychology, and, did, not, demand, that, any, decision, be, made, between, experimental, statistical, methods, and, interpretative, methods, qualitative, methods, whenever, appropriate, he, referred, to, findings, from, interpretation, and, experimental, research, within, a, multimethod, approach, thus, for, example, the, chapters, on, the, development, of, language, or, on, enlargement, of, fantasy, activity, in, cultural, psychology, also, contain, experimental, statistical, and, psychophysiological, findings, he, was, very, familiar, with, these, methods, and, used, them, in, extended, research, projects, this, was, without, precedent, and, has, since, then, rarely, been, achieved, by, another, individual, researcher, in, the, introduction, to, his, grundz, ge, der, physiologischen, psychologie, in, 1874, wundt, described, immanuel, kant, and, johann, friedrich, herbart, as, the, philosophers, who, had, the, most, influence, on, the, formation, of, his, own, views, those, who, follow, up, these, references, will, find, that, wundt, critically, analysed, both, these, thinkers, ideas, he, distanced, himself, from, herbart, s, science, of, the, soul, and, in, particular, from, his, mechanism, of, mental, representations, and, pseudo, mathematical, speculations, while, wundt, praised, kant, s, critical, work, and, his, rejection, of, a, rational, psychology, deduced, from, metaphysics, he, argued, against, kant, s, epistemology, in, his, publication, was, soll, uns, kant, nicht, sein, what, kant, should, we, reject, 1892, with, regard, to, the, forms, of, perception, and, presuppositions, as, well, as, kant, s, category, theory, and, his, position, in, the, dispute, on, causal, and, teleological, explanations, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, had, a, far, greater, and, more, constructive, influence, on, wundt, s, psychology, philosophy, epistemology, and, ethics, this, can, be, gleaned, from, wundt, s, leibniz, publication, 1917, and, from, his, central, terms, and, principles, but, has, since, received, almost, no, attention, wundt, gave, up, his, plans, for, a, biography, of, leibniz, but, praised, leibniz, s, thinking, on, the, two, hundredth, anniversary, of, his, death, in, 1916, he, did, however, disagree, with, leibniz, s, monadology, as, well, as, theories, on, the, mathematisation, of, the, world, by, removing, the, domain, of, the, mind, from, this, view, leibniz, developed, a, new, concept, of, the, soul, through, his, discussion, on, substance, and, actuality, on, dynamic, spiritual, change, and, on, the, correspondence, between, body, and, soul, parallelism, wundt, secularised, such, guiding, principles, and, reformulated, important, philosophical, positions, of, leibniz, away, from, belief, in, god, as, the, creator, and, belief, in, an, immortal, soul, wundt, gained, important, ideas, and, exploited, them, in, an, original, way, in, his, principles, and, methodology, of, empirical, psychology, the, principle, of, actuality, psychophysical, parallelism, combination, of, causal, and, teleological, analysis, apperception, theory, the, psychology, of, striving, i, e, volition, and, voluntary, tendency, principles, of, epistemology, and, the, perspectivism, of, thought, wundt, s, differentiation, between, the, natural, causality, of, neurophysiology, and, the, mental, causality, of, psychology, the, intellect, is, a, direct, rendering, from, leibniz, s, epistemology, wundt, devised, the, term, psychophysical, parallelism, and, meant, thereby, two, fundamentally, different, ways, of, considering, the, postulated, psychophysical, unit, not, just, two, views, in, the, sense, of, fechner, s, theory, of, identity, wundt, derived, the, co, ordinated, consideration, of, natural, causality, and, mental, causality, from, leibniz, s, differentiation, between, causality, and, teleology, principle, of, sufficient, reason, the, psychological, and, physiological, statements, exist, in, two, categorically, different, reference, systems, the, main, categories, are, to, be, emphasised, in, order, to, prevent, category, mistakes, with, his, epistemology, of, mental, causality, he, differed, from, contemporary, authors, who, also, advocated, the, position, of, parallelism, wundt, had, developed, the, first, genuine, epistemology, and, methodology, of, empirical, psychology, wundt, shaped, the, term, apperception, introduced, by, leibniz, into, an, experimental, psychologically, based, apperception, psychology, that, included, neuropsychological, modelling, when, leibniz, differentiates, between, two, fundamental, functions, perception, and, striving, this, approach, can, be, recognised, in, wundt, s, motivation, theory, the, central, theme, of, unity, in, the, manifold, unitas, in, multitudine, also, originates, from, leibniz, who, has, influenced, the, current, understanding, of, perspectivism, and, viewpoint, dependency, wundt, characterised, this, style, of, thought, in, a, way, that, also, applied, for, him, the, principle, of, the, equality, of, viewpoints, that, supplement, one, another, plays, a, significant, role, in, his, thinking, viewpoints, that, supplement, one, another, while, also, being, able, to, appear, as, opposites, that, only, resolve, themselves, when, considered, more, deeply, unlike, the, great, majority, of, contemporary, and, current, authors, in, psychology, wundt, laid, out, the, philosophical, and, methodological, positions, of, his, work, clearly, wundt, was, against, the, founding, empirical, psychology, on, a, metaphysical, or, structural, principle, of, soul, as, in, christian, belief, in, an, immortal, soul, or, in, a, philosophy, that, argues, substance, ontologically, wundt, s, position, was, decisively, rejected, by, several, christianity, oriented, psychologists, and, philosophers, as, a, psychology, without, soul, although, he, did, not, use, this, formulation, from, friedrich, lange, 1866, who, was, his, predecessor, in, z, rich, from, 1870, to, 1872, wundt, s, guiding, principle, was, the, development, theory, of, the, mind, wundt, s, ethics, also, led, to, polemical, critiques, due, to, his, renunciation, of, an, ultimate, transcendental, basis, of, ethics, god, the, absolute, wundt, s, evolutionism, was, also, criticised, for, its, claim, that, ethical, norms, had, been, culturally, changed, in, the, course, of, human, intellectual, development, wundt, s, autobiography, and, his, inaugural, lectures, in, zurich, and, leipzig, as, well, as, his, commemorative, speeches, for, fechner, and, his, essay, on, leibniz, provide, an, insight, into, the, history, of, wundt, s, education, and, the, contemporary, flows, and, intellectual, controversies, in, the, second, half, of, the, 19th, century, wundt, primarily, refers, to, leibniz, and, kant, more, indirectly, to, johann, gottlieb, fichte, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, friedrich, wilhelm, joseph, schelling, and, arthur, schopenhauer, and, to, johann, friedrich, herbart, gustav, theodor, fechner, and, hermann, lotze, regarding, psychology, in, addition, to, john, locke, george, berkeley, david, hume, and, john, stuart, mill, one, finds, francis, bacon, charles, darwin, and, charles, spencer, as, well, as, french, thinkers, such, as, auguste, comte, and, hippolyte, taine, all, of, whom, are, more, rarely, quoted, by, wundt, wundt, distanced, himself, from, the, metaphysical, term, soul, and, from, theories, about, its, structure, and, properties, as, posited, by, herbart, lotze, and, fechner, wundt, followed, kant, and, warned, against, a, primarily, metaphysically, founded, philosophically, deduced, psychology, where, one, notices, the, author, s, metaphysical, point, of, view, in, the, treatment, of, every, problem, then, an, unconditional, empirical, science, is, no, longer, involved, but, a, metaphysical, theory, intended, to, serve, as, an, exemplification, of, experience, he, is, however, convinced, that, every, single, science, contains, general, prerequisites, of, a, philosophical, nature, all, psychological, investigation, extrapolates, from, metaphysical, presuppositions, epistemology, was, to, help, sciences, find, out, about, clarify, or, supplement, their, metaphysical, aspects, and, as, far, as, possible, free, themselves, of, them, psychology, and, the, other, sciences, always, rely, on, the, help, of, philosophy, here, and, particularly, on, logic, and, epistemology, otherwise, only, an, immanent, philosophy, i, e, metaphysical, assumptions, of, an, unsystematic, nature, would, form, in, the, individual, sciences, wundt, is, decidedly, against, the, segregation, of, philosophy, he, is, concerned, about, psychologists, bringing, their, own, personal, metaphysical, convictions, into, psychology, and, that, these, presumptions, would, no, longer, be, exposed, to, epistemological, criticism, therefore, nobody, would, suffer, more, from, such, a, segregation, than, the, psychologists, themselves, and, through, them, psychology, nothing, would, promote, the, degeneration, to, a, mere, craftsmanship, more, than, its, segregation, from, philosophy, wundt, claimed, that, philosophy, as, a, general, science, has, the, task, of, uniting, to, become, a, consistent, system, through, the, general, knowledge, acquired, via, the, individual, sciences, human, rationality, strives, for, a, uniform, i, e, non, contradictory, explanatory, principle, for, being, and, consciousness, for, an, ultimate, reasoning, for, ethics, and, for, a, philosophical, world, basis, metaphysics, is, the, same, attempt, to, gain, a, binding, world, view, as, a, component, of, individual, knowledge, on, the, basis, of, the, entire, scientific, awareness, of, an, age, or, particularly, prominent, content, wundt, was, convinced, that, empirical, psychology, also, contributed, fundamental, knowledge, on, the, understanding, of, humans, for, anthropology, and, ethics, beyond, its, narrow, scientific, field, starting, from, the, active, and, creative, synthetic, apperception, processes, of, consciousness, wundt, considered, that, the, unifying, function, was, to, be, found, in, volitional, processes, and, the, conscious, setting, of, objectives, and, subsequent, activities, there, is, simply, nothing, more, to, a, man, that, he, can, entirely, call, his, own, except, for, his, will, one, can, detect, a, voluntaristic, tendency, in, wundt, s, theory, of, motivation, in, contrast, to, the, currently, widespread, cognitivism, intellectualism, wundt, extrapolated, this, empirically, founded, volitional, psychology, to, a, metaphysical, voluntarism, he, demands, however, that, the, empirical, psychological, and, derived, metaphysical, voluntarism, are, kept, apart, from, one, another, and, firmly, maintained, that, his, empirical, psychology, was, created, independently, of, the, various, teachings, of, metaphysics, wundt, interpreted, intellectual, cultural, progress, and, biological, evolution, as, a, general, process, of, development, whereby, however, he, did, not, want, to, follow, the, abstract, ideas, of, entelechy, vitalism, animism, and, by, no, means, schopenhauer, s, volitional, metaphysics, he, believed, that, the, source, of, dynamic, development, was, to, be, found, in, the, most, elementary, expressions, of, life, in, reflexive, and, instinctive, behaviour, and, constructed, a, continuum, of, attentive, and, apperceptive, processes, volitional, or, selective, acts, up, to, social, activities, and, ethical, decisions, at, the, end, of, this, rational, idea, he, recognised, a, practical, ideal, the, idea, of, humanity, as, the, highest, yardstick, of, our, actions, and, that, the, overall, course, of, human, history, can, be, understood, with, regard, to, the, ideal, of, humanity, parallel, to, wundt, s, work, on, cultural, psychology, he, wrote, his, much, read, ethik, 1886, 3rd, ed, in, 2, vols, 1903, whose, introduction, stressed, how, important, development, considerations, are, in, order, to, grasp, religion, customs, and, morality, wundt, considered, the, questions, of, ethics, to, be, closely, linked, with, the, empirical, psychology, of, motivated, acts, psychology, has, been, such, an, important, introduction, for, me, and, such, an, indispensable, aid, for, the, investigation, of, ethics, that, i, do, not, understand, how, one, could, do, without, it, wundt, sees, two, paths, the, anthropological, examination, of, the, facts, of, a, moral, life, in, the, sense, of, cultural, psychology, and, the, scientific, reflection, on, the, concepts, of, morals, the, derived, principles, are, to, be, examined, in, a, variety, of, areas, the, family, society, the, state, education, etc, in, his, discussion, on, free, will, as, an, attempt, to, mediate, between, determinism, and, indeterminism, he, categorically, distinguishes, between, two, perspectives, there, is, indeed, a, natural, causality, of, brain, processes, though, conscious, processes, are, not, determined, by, an, intelligible, but, by, the, empirical,

life, conditions, individualism, and, utilitarianism, are, strictly, rejected, in, his, view, only, the, universal, intellectual, life, can, be, considered, to, be, an, end, in, itself, wundt, also, spoke, on, the, idea, of, humanity, in, ethics, on, human, rights, and, human, duties, in, his, speech, as, rector, of, leipzig, university, in, 1889, on, the, centenary, of, the, french, revolution, wundt, divided, up, his, three, volume, logik, into, general, logic, and, epistemology, logic, of, the, exact, sciences, and, logic, of, the, humanities, while, logic, the, doctrine, of, categories, and, other, principles, were, discussed, by, wundt, in, a, traditional, manner, they, were, also, considered, from, the, point, of, view, of, development, theory, of, the, human, intellect, i, e, in, accordance, with, the, psychology, of, thought, the, subsequent, equitable, description, of, the, special, principles, of, the, natural, sciences, and, the, humanities, enabled, wundt, to, create, a, new, epistemology, the, ideas, that, remain, current, include, epistemology, and, the, methodology, of, psychology, the, tasks, and, directions, of, psychology, the, methods, of, interpretation, and,

present, the, last, wundt, biography, which, tried, to, represent, both, wundt, s, psychology, and, his, philosophy, was, by, eisler, 1902, one, can, also, get, an, idea, of, wundt, s, thoughts, from, his, autobiography, erlebtes, und, erkanntes, 1920, later, biographies, by, nef, 1923, and, petersen, 1925, up, to, arnold, in, 1980, restrict, themselves, primarily, to, the, psychology, or, the,

and, max, planck, signed, the, patriotic, call, to, arms, as, did, about, 4, 000, professors, and, lecturers, in, germany, and, during, the, following, years, he, wrote, several, political, speeches, and, essays, that, were, also, characterized, by, the, feeling, of, a, superiority, of, german, science, and, culture, during, wundt, s, early, heidelberg, time, he, espoused, liberal, views, he, co, founded, the, association, of, german, workers, associations, he, was, a, member, of, the, liberal, progressive, party, of, baden, from, 1866, to, 1869, he, represented, heidelberg, in, the, baden, states, assembly, in, old, age, wundt, appeared, to, become, more, conservative, see, wundt, 1920, wundt, s, correspondence, then, also, in, response, to, world, war, i, the, subsequent, social, unrest, and, the, severe, revolutionary, events, of, the, post, war, period, adopted, an, attitude, that, was, patriotic, and, lent, towards, nationalism, wilhelm, wundt, s, son, philosopher, max, wundt, had, an, even, more, clearly, intense, somewhat, nationalist, stance, although, not, a, member, of, the, nazi, party, nsdap, max, wundt, wrote, about, national, traditions, and, race, in, philosophical, thinking, four, wilhelm, wundt, societies, or, associations, have, been, founded, the, deutsche, gesellschaft, f, r, psychologie, german, society, for, psychology, grants, a, wilhelm, wundt, medal, the, psychiatrist, emil, kraepelin, described, the, pioneering, spirit, at, the, new, leipzig, institute, in, this, fashion, we, felt, that, we, were, trailblazers, entering, virgin, territory, like, creators, of, a, science, with, undreamt, of, prospects, wundt, spent, several, afternoons, every, week, in, his, adjacent, modest, professorial, office, came, to, see, us, advised, us, and, often, got, involved, in, the, experiments, he, was, also, available, to, us, at, any, time, the, philosopher, rudolf, eisler, considered, wundt, s, approach, as, follows, a, major, advantage, of, wundt, s, philosophy, is, that, it, neither, consciously, nor, unconsciously, takes, metaphysics, back, to, its, beginnings, but, strictly, distinguishes, between, empirical, scientific, and, epistemological, metaphysical, approaches, and, considers, each, point, of, view, in, isolation, in, its, relative, legitimacy, before, finally, producing, a, uniform, world, view, wundt, always, differentiates, between, the, physical, physiological, and, the, purely, psychological, and, then, again, from, the, philosophical, point, of, view, as, a, result, apparent, contradictions, are, created, for, those, who, do, not, observe, more, precisely, and, who, constantly, forget, that, the, differences, in, results, are, only, due, to, the, approach, and, not, the, laws, of, reality, traugott, oesterreich, 1923, 1951, wrote, an, unusually, detailed, description, of, wundt, s, work, in, his, grundriss, der, geschichte, der, philosophie, foundations, of, the, history, of, philosophy, this, knowledgeable, representation, examines, wundt, s, main, topics, views, and, scientific, activities, and, exceeds, the, generally, much, briefer, wundt, reception, within, the, field, of, psychology, in, which, many, of, the, important, prerequisites, and, references, are, ignored, right, from, the, start, the, internal, consistency, of, wundt, s, work, from, 1862, to, 1920, between, the, main, works, and, within, the, reworked, editions, has, repeatedly, been, discussed, and, been, subject, to, differing, assessments, in, parts, one, could, not, say, that, the, scientific, conception, of, psychology, underwent, a, fundamental, revision, of, principal, ideas, and, central, postulates, though, there, was, gradual, development, and, a, change, in, emphasis, one, could, consider, wundt, s, gradual, concurrence, with, kant, s, position, that, conscious, processes, are, not, measurable, on, the, basis, of, self, observation, and, cannot, be, mathematically, formulated, to, be, a, major, divergence, wundt, however, never, claimed, that, psychology, could, be, advanced, through, experiment, and, measurement, alone, but, had, already, stressed, in, 1862, that, the, development, history, of, the, mind, and, comparative, psychology, should, provide, some, assistance, wundt, attempted, to, redefine, and, restructure, the, fields, of, psychology, and, philosophy, experimental, psychology, in, the, narrower, sense, and, child, psychology, form, individual, psychology, while, cultural, and, animal, psychology, are, both, parts, of, a, general, and, comparative, psychology, none, of, his, leipzig, assistants, and, hardly, any, textbook, authors, in, the, subsequent, two, generations, have, adopted, wundt, s, broad, theoretical, horizon, his, demanding, scientific, theory, or, the, multi, method, approach, oswald, k, lpe, had, already, ruled, cultural, and, animal, psychology, out, while, the, principles, of, physiological, psychology, met, with, worldwide, resonance, wundt, s, cultural, psychology, ethno, psychology, appeared, to, have, had, a, less, widespread, impact, but, there, are, indications, that, george, herbert, mead, and, franz, boas, among, others, were, influenced, by, it, in, his, totem, and, taboo, sigmund, freud, frequently, quoted, wundt, s, cultural, psychology, in, its, time, wundt, s, ethik, received, more, reviews, than, almost, any, of, his, other, main, works, most, of, the, objections, were, ranged, against, his, renouncing, any, ultimate, transcendental, ethical, basis, god, the, absolute, as, well, as, against, his, ideas, regarding, evolution, i, e, that, ethical, standards, changed, culturally, in, the, course, of, human, intellectual, development, as, wundt, did, not, describe, any, concrete, ethical, conflicts, on, the, basis, of, examples, and, did, not, describe, any, social, ethics, in, particular, his, teachings, with, the, general, idea, of, humanism, appear, rather, too, abstract, the, xxii, international, congress, for, psychology, in, leipzig, in, 1980, i, e, on, the, hundredth, jubilee, of, the, initial, founding, of, the, institute, in, 1879, stimulated, a, number, of, publications, about, wundt, also, in, the, us, very, little, productive, research, work, has, been, carried, out, since, then, while, wundt, was, occasionally, mentioned, in, the, centenary, review, of, the, founding, of, the, german, society, for, experimental, psychology, 1904, 2004, it, was, without, the, principal, ideas, of, his, psychology, and, philosophy, of, science, leipzig, was, a, world, famous, centre, for, the, new, psychology, after, 1874, there, are, various, interpretations, regarding, why, wundt, s, influence, after, the, turn, of, the, century, i, e, during, his, lifetime, rapidly, waned, and, from, his, position, as, founding, father, wundt, became, almost, an, outsider, a, survey, was, conducted, on, the, basis, of, more, than, 200, contemporary, and, later, sources, reviews, and, critiques, of, his, publications, since, 1858, references, to, wundt, s, work, in, textbooks, on, psychology, and, the, history, of, psychology, from, 1883, to, 2010, biographies, congress, reports, praise, on, his, decadal, birthdays, obituaries, and, other, texts, a, range, of, scientific, controversies, were, presented, in, detail, reasons, for, the, distancing, of, wundt, and, why, some, of, his, concepts, have, fallen, into, oblivion, can, be, seen, in, his, scientific, work, in, his, philosophical, orientation, in, his, didactics, or, in, the, person, of, wundt, himself, wundt, s, terminology, also, created, difficulties, because, he, had, from, today, s, point, of, view, given, some, of, his, most, important, ideas, unfortunate, names, so, that, there, were, constant, misunderstandings, examples, include, a, representation, of, wundt, s, psychology, as, natural, science, element, psychology, or, dualistic, conceptions, is, evidence, of, enduring, misunderstandings, it, is, therefore, necessary, to, remember, wundt, s, expressly, stated, desire, for, uniformity, and, lack, of, contradiction, for, the, mutual, supplementation, of, psychological, perspectives, wundt, s, more, demanding, sometimes, more, complicated, and, relativizing, then, again, very, precise, style, can, also, be, difficult, even, for, today, s, german, readers, a, high, level, of, linguistic, competence, is, required, there, are, only, english, translations, for, very, few, of, wundt, s, work, in, particular, the, grundz, ge, der, physiologischen, psychologie, expanded, into, three, volumes, and, the, ten, volumes, of, v, lkerpsychologie, all, the, books, on, philosophy, and, important, essays, on, the, theory, of, science, remain, untranslated, such, shortcomings, may, explain, many, of, the, fundamental, deficits, and, lasting, misunderstandings, in, the, anglo, american, reception, of, wundt, s, work, massive, misconceptions, about, wundt, s, work, have, been, demonstrated, by, william, james, granville, stanley, hall, edward, boring, and, edward, titchener, as, well, as, among, many, later, authors, titchener, a, two, year, resident, of, wundt, s, lab, and, one, of, wundt, s, most, vocal, advocates, in, the, united, states, is, responsible, for, several, english, translations, and, mistranslations, of, wundt, s, works, that, supported, his, own, views, and, approach, which, he, termed, structuralism, and, claimed, was, wholly, consistent, with, wundt, s, position, as, wundt, s, three, volume, logik, und, wissenschaftslehre, i, e, his, theory, of, science, also, remains, untranslated, the, close, interrelationships, between, wundt, s, empirical, psychology, and, his, epistemology, and, methodology, philosophy, and, ethics, are, also, regularly, missing, even, if, later, collections, describe, individual, facets, of, them, blumenthal, s, assessment, that, american, textbook, accounts, of, wundt, now, present, highly, inaccurate, and, mythological, caricatures, of, the, man, and, his, work, still, appears, to, be, true, of, most, publications, about, wundt, a, highly, contradictory, picture, emerges, from, any, systematic, research, on, his, reception, on, the, one, hand, the, pioneer, of, experimental, psychology, and, founder, of, modern, psychology, as, a, discipline, is, praised, on, the, other, hand, his, work, is, insufficiently, tapped, and, appears, to, have, had, little, influence, misunderstandings, and, stereotypical, evaluations, continue, into, the, present, even, in, some, representations, of, the, history, of, psychology, and, in, textbooks, wundt, s, entire, work, is, investigated, in, a, more, focused, manner, in, more, recent, assessments, regarding, the, reception, of, wundt, and, his, theory, of, science, and, his, philosophy, is, included, araujo, 2016, danziger, 1983, 1990, 2001, fahrenberg, 2011, 2015, 2016, j, ttemann, 2006, kim, 2016, van, rappard, 1980, like, other, important, psychologists, and, philosophers, wundt, was, subject, to, ideological, criticism, for, example, by, authors, of, a, more, christianity, based, psychology, by, authors, with, materialistic, and, positivistic, scientific, opinions, or, from, the, point, of, view, of, marxist, leninist, philosophy, and, social, theory, as, in, leipzig, german, democratic, republic, up, to, 1990, wundt, was, involved, in, a, number, of, scientific, controversies, or, was, responsible, for, triggering, them, there, are, many, forms, of, criticism, of, wundt, s, psychology, of, his, apperception, psychology, of, his, motivation, theory, of, his, version, of, psychophysical, parallelism, with, its, concept, of, mental, causality, his, refutation, of, psychoanalytic, speculation, about, the, unconscious, or, of, his, critical, realism, a, recurring, criticism, is, that, wundt, largely, ignored, the, areas, of, psychology, that, he, found, less, interesting, such, as, differential, psychology, child, psychology, and, educational, psychology, in, his, cultural, psychology, there, is, no, empirical, social, psychology, because, there, were, still, no, methods, for, investigating, it, at, the, time, among, his, postgraduate, students, assistants, and, other, colleagues, however, were, several, important, pioneers, differential, psychology, mental, measurement, and, intelligence, testing, james, mckeen, cattell, charles, spearman, social, psychology, of, group, pocesses, and, the, psychology, of, work, walther, moede, applied, psychology, ernst, meumann, hugo, m, nsterberg, psychopathology, psychopharmacology, and, clinical, diagnosis, emil, kraepelin, wundt, further, influenced, many, american, psychologists, to, create, psychology, graduate, programs, wundt, developed, the, first, comprehensive, and, uniform, theory, of, the, science, of, psychology, the, special, epistemological, and, methodological, status, of, psychology, is, postulated, in, this, wide, ranging, conceptualization, characterized, by, his, neurophysiological, psychological, and, philosophical, work, the, human, as, a, thinking, and, motivated, subject, is, not, to, be, captured, in, the, terms, of, the, natural, sciences, psychology, requires, special, categories, and, autonomous, epistemological, principles, it, is, on, the, one, hand, an, empirical, humanity, but, should, not, on, the, other, hand, ignore, its, physiological, basis, and, philosophical, assumptions, thus, a, varied, multi, method, approach, is, necessary, self, observation, experimentation, generic, comparison, and, interpretation, wundt, demanded, the, ability, and, readiness, to, distinguish, between, perspectives, and, reference, systems, and, to, understand, the, necessary, supplementation, of, these, reference, systems, in, changes, of, perspective, he, defined, the, field, of, psychology, very, widely, and, as, interdisciplinary, and, also, explained, just, how, indispensable, is, the, epistemological, philosophical, criticism, of, psychological, theories, and, their, philosophical, prerequisites, psychology, should, remain, connected, with, philosophy, in, order, to, promote, this, critique, of, knowledge, of, the, metaphysical, presuppositions, so, widespread, among, psychologists, the, conceptual, relationships, within, the, complete, works, created, over, decades, and, continuously, reworked, have, hardly, been, systematically, investigated, the, most, important, theoretical, basis, is, the, empirical, psychological, theory, of, apperception, based, on, leibniz, s, philosophical, position, that, wundt, on, the, one, hand, based, on, experimental, psychology, and, his, neuropsychological, modelling, and, on, the, other, hand, extrapolated, into, a, development, theory, for, culture, the, fundamental, reconstruction, of, wundt, s, main, ideas, is, a, task, that, cannot, be, achieved, by, any, one, person, today, due, to, the, complexity, of, the, complete, works, he, tried, to, connect, the, fundamental, controversies, of, the, research, directions, epistemologically, and, methodologically, by, means, of, a, co, ordinated, concept, in, a, confident, handling, of, the, categorically, basically, different, ways, of, considering, the, interrelations, here, during, the, founding, phase, of, university, psychology, he, already, argued, for, a, highly, demanding, meta, science, meta, scientific, reflection, and, this, potential, to,
