residence, in, steventon, henry, was, the, first, child, to, be, born, there, in, 1771, at, about, this, time, cassandra, could, no, longer, ignore, the, signs, that, little, george, was, developmentally, disabled, he, had, seizures, and, may, have, been, deaf, and, mute, at, this, time, she, chose, to, send, him, to, be, fostered, in, 1773, cassandra, was, born, followed, by, francis, in, 1774, and, jane, in, 1775, according, to, biographer, park, honan, the, atmosphere, of, the, austen, home, was, an, open, amused, easy, intellectual, one, where, the, ideas, of, those, with, whom, the, austens, might, disagree, politically, or, socially, were, considered, and, discussed, the, family, relied, on, the, patronage, of, their, kin, and, hosted, visits, from, numerous, family, members, mrs, austen, spent, the, summer, of, 1770, in, london, with, george, s, sister, philadelphia, and, her, daughter, eliza, accompanied, by, his, other, sister, mrs, walter, and, her, daughter, philly, philadelphia, and, eliza, hancock, were, according, to, le, faye, the, bright, comets, flashing, into, an, otherwise, placid, solar, system, of, clerical, life, in, rural, hampshire, and, the, news, of, their, foreign, travels, and, fashionable, london, life, together, with, their, sudden, descents, upon, the, steventon, household, in, between, times, all, helped, to, widen, jane, s, youthful, horizon, and, influence, her, later, life, and, works, cassandra, austen, s, cousin, thomas, leigh, visited, a, number, of, times, in, the, 1770s, and, 1780s, inviting, young, cassie, to, visit, them, in, bath, in, 1781, the, first, mention, of, jane, occurs, in, family, documents, upon, her, return, and, almost, home, they, were, when, they, met, jane, charles, the, two, little, ones, of, the, family, who, had, to, go, as, far, as, new, down, to, meet, the, chaise, have, the, pleasure, of, riding, home, in, it, le, faye, writes, that, mr, austen, s, predictions, for, his, younger, daughter, were, fully, justified, never, were, sisters, more, to, each, other, than, cassandra, and, jane, while, in, a, particularly, affectionate, family, there, seems, to, have, been, a, special, link, between, cassandra, and, edward, on, the, one, hand, and, between, henry, and, jane, on, the, other, from, 1773, until, 1796, george, austen, supplemented, his, income, by, farming, and, by, teaching, three, or, four, boys, at, a, time, who, boarded, at, his, home, the, reverend, austen, had, an, annual, income, of, 200, equivalent, to, 32, 000, in, 2023, from, his, two, livings, this, was, a, very, modest, income, at, the, time, by, comparison, a, skilled, worker, like, a, blacksmith, or, a, carpenter, could, make, about, 100, annually, while, the, typical, annual, income, of, a, gentry, family, was, between, 1, 000, and, 5, 000, mr, austen, also, rented, the, 200, acre, cheesedown, farm, from, his, benefactor, thomas, knight, which, could, make, a, profit, of, 300, equivalent, to, 48, 000, in, 2023, a, year, during, this, period, of, her, life, jane, austen, attended, church, regularly, socialised, with, friends, and, neighbours, and, read, novels, often, of, her, own, composition, aloud, to, her, family, in, the, evenings, socialising, with, the, neighbours, often, meant, dancing, either, impromptu, in, someone, s, home, after, supper, or, at, the, balls, held, regularly, at, the, assembly, rooms, in, the, town, hall, her, brother, henry, later, said, that, jane, was, fond, of, dancing, and, excelled, in, it, in, 1783, austen, and, her, sister, cassandra, were, sent, to, oxford, to, be, educated, by, mrs, ann, cawley, who, took, them, to, southampton, later, that, year, that, autumn, both, girls, were, sent, home, after, catching, typhus, from, which, jane, austen, nearly, died, she, was, from, then, home, educated, until, she, attended, boarding, school, with, her, sister, from, early, in, 1785, at, the, reading, abbey, girls, school, ruled, by, mrs, la, tournelle, the, curriculum, probably, included, french, spelling, needlework, dancing, music, and, drama, the, sisters, returned, home, before, december, 1786, because, the, school, fees, for, the, two, girls, were, too, high, for, the, austen, family, after, 1786, austen, never, again, lived, anywhere, beyond, the, bounds, of, her, immediate, family, environment, her, education, came, from, reading, guided, by, her, father, and, brothers, james, and, henry, irene, collins, said, that, austen, used, some, of, the, same, school, books, as, the, boys, austen, apparently, had, unfettered, access, both, to, her, father, s, library, and, that, of, a, family, friend, warren, hastings, together, these, collections, amounted, to, a, large, and, varied, library, her, father, was, also, tolerant, of, austen, s, sometimes, risqu, experiments, in, writing, and, provided, both, sisters, with, expensive, paper, and, other, materials, for, their, writing, and, drawing, private, theatricals, were, an, essential, part, of, austen, s, education, from, her, early, childhood, the, family, and, friends, staged, a, series, of, plays, in, the, rectory, barn, including, richard, sheridan, s, the, rivals, 1775, and, david, garrick, s, bon, ton, austen, s, eldest, brother, james, wrote, the, prologues, and, epilogues, and, she, probably, joined, in, these, activities, first, as, a, spectator, and, later, as, a, participant, most, of, the, plays, were, comedies, which, suggests, how, austen, s, satirical, gifts, were, cultivated, at, the, age, of, 12, she, tried, her, own, hand, at, dramatic, writing, she, wrote, three, short, plays, during, her, teenage, years, from, at, least, the, time, she, was, aged, eleven, austen, wrote, poems, and, stories, to, amuse, herself, and, her, family, she, exaggerated, mundane, details, of, daily, life, and, parodied, common, plot, devices, in, stories, full, of, anarchic, fantasies, of, female, power, licence, illicit, behaviour, and, general, high, spirits, according, to, janet, todd, containing, work, written, between, 1787, and, 1793, the, juvenilia, or, childhood, writings, that, austen, compiled, fair, copies, consisted, of, twenty, nine, early, works, into, three, bound, notebooks, now, referred, to, as, the, juvenilia, she, called, the, three, notebooks, volume, the, first, volume, the, second, and, volume, the, third, and, they, preserve, 90, 000, words, she, wrote, during, those, years, the, juvenilia, are, often, according, to, scholar, richard, jenkyns, boisterous, and, anarchic, he, compares, them, to, the, work, of, 18th, century, novelist, laurence, sterne, among, these, works, is, a, satirical, novel, in, letters, titled, love, and, freindship, written, when, aged, fourteen, in, 1790, in, which, she, mocked, popular, novels, of, sensibility, the, next, year, she, wrote, the, history, of, england, a, manuscript, of, thirty, four, pages, accompanied, by, thirteen, watercolour, miniatures, by, her, sister, cassandra, austen, s, history, parodied, popular, historical, writing, particularly, oliver, goldsmith, s, history, of, england, 1764, honan, speculates, that, not, long, after, writing, love, and, freindship, austen, decided, to, write, for, profit, to, make, stories, her, central, effort, that, is, to, become, a, professional, writer, when, she, was, around, eighteen, years, old, austen, began, to, write, longer, more, sophisticated, works, in, august, 1792, aged, seventeen, austen, started, catharine, or, the, bower, which, presaged, her, mature, work, especially, northanger, abbey, but, was, left, unfinished, until, picked, up, in, lady, susan, which, todd, describes, as, less, prefiguring, than, catharine, a, year, later, she, began, but, abandoned, a, short, play, later, titled, sir, charles, grandison, or, the, happy, man, a, comedy, in, 6, acts, which, she, returned, to, and, completed, around, 1800, this, was, a, short, parody, of, various, school, textbook, abridgements, of, austen, s, favourite, contemporary, novel, the, history, of, sir, charles, grandison, 1753, by, samuel, richardson, when, austen, became, an, aunt, for, the, first, time, aged, eighteen, she, sent, new, born, niece, fanny, catherine, austen, knight, five, short, pieces, of, the, juvenilia, now, known, collectively, as, scraps, purporting, to, be, her, opinions, and, admonitions, on, the, conduct, of, young, women, for, jane, anna, elizabeth, austen, also, born, in, 1793, her, aunt, wrote, two, more, miscellanious, morsels, dedicating, them, to, on, 2, june, 1793, convinced, that, if, you, seriously, attend, to, them, you, will, derive, from, them, very, important, instructions, with, regard, to, your, conduct, in, life, there, is, manuscript, evidence, that, austen, continued, to, work, on, these, pieces, as, late, as, 1811, when, she, was, 36, and, that, her, niece, and, nephew, anna, and, james, edward, austen, made, further, additions, as, late, as, 1814, between, 1793, and, 1795, aged, eighteen, to, twenty, austen, wrote, lady, susan, a, short, epistolary, novel, usually, described, as, her, most, ambitious, and, sophisticated, early, work, it, is, unlike, any, of, austen, s, other, works, austen, biographer, claire, tomalin, describes, the, novella, s, heroine, as, a, sexual, predator, who, uses, her, intelligence, and, charm, to, manipulate, betray, and, abuse, her, lovers, friends, and, family, tomalin, writes, told, in, letters, it, is, as, neatly, plotted, as, a, play, and, as, cynical, in, tone, as, any, of, the, most, outrageous, of, the, restoration, dramatists, who, may, have, provided, some, of, her, inspiration, it, stands, alone, in, austen, s, work, as, a, study, of, an, adult, woman, whose, intelligence, and, force, of, character, are, greater, than, those, of, anyone, she, encounters, according, to, janet, todd, the, model, for, the, title, character, may, have, been, eliza, de, feuillide, who, inspired, austen, with, stories, of, her, glamorous, life, and, various, adventures, eliza, s, french, husband, was, guillotined, in, 1794, she, married, jane, s, brother, henry, austen, in, 1797, when, austen, was, twenty, tom, lefroy, a, neighbour, visited, steventon, from, december, 1795, to, january, 1796, he, had, just, finished, a, university, degree, and, was, moving, to, london, for, training, as, a, barrister, lefroy, and, austen, would, have, been, introduced, at, a, ball, or, other, neighbourhood, social, gathering, and, it, is, clear, from, austen, s, letters, to, cassandra, that, they, spent, considerable, time, together, i, am, almost, afraid, to, tell, you, how, my, irish, friend, and, i, behaved, imagine, to, yourself, everything, most, profligate, and, shocking, in, the, way, of, dancing, and, sitting, down, together, austen, wrote, in, her, first, surviving, letter, to, her, sister, cassandra, that, lefroy, was, a, very, gentlemanlike, good, looking, pleasant, young, man, five, days, later, in, another, letter, austen, wrote, that, she, expected, an, offer, from, her, friend, and, that, i, shall, refuse, him, however, unless, he, promises, to, give, away, his, white, coat, going, on, to, write, i, will, confide, myself, in, the, future, to, mr, tom, lefroy, for, whom, i, don, t, give, a, sixpence, and, refuse, all, others, the, next, day, austen, wrote, the, day, will, come, on, which, i, flirt, my, last, with, tom, lefroy, and, when, you, receive, this, it, will, be, all, over, my, tears, flow, as, i, write, at, this, melancholy, idea, halperin, cautioned, that, austen, often, satirised, popular, sentimental, romantic, fiction, in, her, letters, and, some, of, the, statements, about, lefroy, may, have, been, ironic, however, it, is, clear, that, austen, was, genuinely, attracted, to, lefroy, and, subsequently, none, of, her, other, suitors, ever, quite, measured, up, to, him, the, lefroy, family, intervened, and, sent, him, away, at, the, end, of, january, marriage, was, impractical, as, both, lefroy, and, austen, must, have, known, neither, had, any, money, and, he, was, dependent, on, a, great, uncle, in, ireland, to, finance, his, education, and, establish, his, legal, career, if, tom, lefroy, later, visited, hampshire, he, was, carefully, kept, away, from, the, austens, and, jane, austen, never, saw, him, again, in, november, 1798, lefroy, was, still, on, austen, s, mind, as, she, wrote, to, her, sister, she, had, tea, with, one, of, his, relatives, wanted, desperately, to, ask, about, him, but, could, not, bring, herself, to, raise, the, subject, after, finishing, lady, susan, austen, began, her, first, full, length, novel, elinor, and, marianne, her, sister, remembered, that, it, was, read, to, the, family, before, 1796, and, was, told, through, a, series, of, letters, without, surviving, original, manuscripts, there, is, no, way, to, know, how, much, of, the, original, draft, survived, in, the, novel, published, anonymously, in, 1811, as, sense, and, sensibility, austen, began, a, second, novel, first, impressions, later, published, as, pride, and, prejudice, in, 1796, she, completed, the, initial, draft, in, august, 1797, aged, 21, as, with, all, of, her, novels, austen, read, the, work, aloud, to, her, family, as, she, was, working, on, it, and, it, became, an, established, favourite, at, this, time, her, father, made, the, first, attempt, to, publish, one, of, her, novels, in, november, 1797, george, austen, wrote, to, thomas, cadell, an, established, publisher, in, london, to, ask, if, he, would, consider, publishing, first, impressions, cadell, returned, mr, austen, s, letter, marking, it, declined, by, return, of, post, austen, may, not, have, known, of, her, father, s, efforts, following, the, completion, of, first, impressions, austen, returned, to, elinor, and, marianne, and, from, november, 1797, until, mid, 1798, revised, it, heavily, she, eliminated, the, epistolary, format, in, favour, of, third, person, narration, and, produced, something, close, to, sense, and, sensibility, in, 1797, austen, met, her, cousin, and, future, sister, in, law, eliza, de, feuillide, a, french, aristocrat, whose, first, husband, the, comte, de, feuillide, had, been, guillotined, causing, her, to, flee, to, britain, where, she, married, henry, austen, the, description, of, the, execution, of, the, comte, de, feuillide, related, by, his, widow, left, austen, with, an, intense, horror, of, the, french, revolution, that, lasted, for, the, rest, of, her, life, during, the, middle, of, 1798, after, finishing, revisions, of, elinor, and, marianne, austen, began, writing, a, third, novel, with, the, working, title, susan, later, northanger, abbey, a, satire, on, the, popular, gothic, novel, austen, completed, her, work, about, a, year, later, in, early, 1803, henry, austen, offered, susan, to, benjamin, crosby, a, london, publisher, who, paid, 10, for, the, copyright, crosby, promised, early, publication, and, went, so, far, as, to, advertise, the, book, publicly, as, being, in, the, press, but, did, nothing, more, the, manuscript, remained, in, crosby, s, hands, unpublished, until, austen, repurchased, the, copyright, from, him, in, 1816, in, december, 1800, george, austen, unexpectedly, announced, his, decision, to, retire, from, the, ministry, leave, steventon, and, move, the, family, to, 4, sydney, place, in, bath, somerset, while, retirement, and, travel, were, good, for, the, elder, austens, jane, austen, was, shocked, to, be, told, she, was, moving, 50, miles, 80, km, away, from, the, only, home, she, had, ever, known, an, indication, of, her, state, of, mind, is, her, lack, of, productivity, as, a, writer, during, the, time, she, lived, in, bath, she, was, able, to, make, some, revisions, to, susan, and, she, began, and, then, abandoned, a, new, novel, the, watsons, but, there, was, nothing, like, the, productivity, of, the, years, 1795, 1799, tomalin, suggests, this, reflects, a, deep, depression, disabling, her, as, a, writer, but, honan, disagrees, arguing, austen, wrote, or, revised, her, manuscripts, throughout, her, creative, life, except, for, a, few, months, after, her, father, died, it, is, often, claimed, that, austen, was, unhappy, in, bath, which, caused, her, to, lose, interest, in, writing, but, it, is, just, as, possible, that, austen, s, social, life, in, bath, prevented, her, from, spending, much, time, writing, novels, the, critic, robert, irvine, argued, that, if, austen, spent, more, time, writing, novels, when, she, was, in, the, countryside, it, might, just, have, been, because, she, had, more, spare, time, as, opposed, to, being, more, happy, in, the, countryside, as, is, often, argued, furthermore, austen, frequently, both, moved, and, travelled, over, southern, england, during, this, period, which, was, hardly, a, conducive, environment, for, writing, a, long, novel, austen, sold, the, rights, to, publish, susan, to, a, publisher, crosby, company, who, paid, her, 10, equivalent, to, 1, 020, in, 2023, the, crosby, company, advertised, susan, but, never, published, it, the, years, from, 1801, to, 1804, are, something, of, a, blank, space, for, austen, scholars, as, cassandra, destroyed, all, of, her, letters, from, her, sister, in, this, period, for, unknown, reasons, in, december, 1802, austen, received, her, only, known, proposal, of, marriage, she, and, her, sister, visited, alethea, and, catherine, bigg, old, friends, who, lived, near, basingstoke, their, younger, brother, harris, bigg, wither, had, recently, finished, his, education, at, oxford, and, was, also, at, home, bigg, wither, proposed, and, austen, accepted, as, described, by, caroline, austen, jane, s, niece, and, reginald, bigg, wither, a, descendant, harris, was, not, attractive, he, was, a, large, plain, looking, man, who, spoke, little, stuttered, when, he, did, speak, was, aggressive, in, conversation, and, almost, completely, tactless, however, austen, had, known, him, since, both, were, young, and, the, marriage, offered, many, practical, advantages, to, austen, and, her, family, he, was, the, heir, to, extensive, family, estates, located, in, the, area, where, the, sisters, had, grown, up, with, these, resources, austen, could, provide, her, parents, a, comfortable, old, age, give, cassandra, a, permanent, home, and, perhaps, assist, her, brothers, in, their, careers, by, the, next, morning, austen, realised, she, had, made, a, mistake, and, withdrew, her, acceptance, no, contemporary, letters, or, diaries, describe, how, austen, felt, about, this, proposal, irvine, described, bigg, wither, as, somebody, who, seems, to, have, been, a, man, very, hard, to, like, let, alone, love, in, 1814, austen, wrote, a, letter, to, her, niece, fanny, knight, who, had, asked, for, advice, about, a, serious, relationship, telling, her, that, having, written, so, much, on, one, side, of, the, question, i, shall, now, turn, around, entreat, you, not, to, commit, yourself, farther, not, to, think, of, accepting, him, unless, you, really, do, like, him, anything, is, to, be, preferred, or, endured, rather, than, marrying, without, affection, the, english, scholar, douglas, bush, wrote, that, austen, had, had, a, very, high, ideal, of, the, love, that, should, unite, a, husband, and, wife, all, of, her, heroines, know, in, proportion, to, their, maturity, the, meaning, of, ardent, love, a, possible, autobiographical, element, in, sense, and, sensibility, occurs, when, elinor, dashwood, contemplates, the, worse, and, most, irremediable, of, all, evils, a, connection, for, life, with, an, unsuitable, man, in, 1804, while, living, in, bath, austen, started, but, did, not, complete, her, novel, the, watsons, the, story, centres, on, an, invalid, and, impoverished, clergyman, and, his, four, unmarried, daughters, sutherland, describes, the, novel, as, a, study, in, the, harsh, economic, realities, of, dependent, women, s, lives, honan, suggests, and, tomalin, agrees, that, austen, chose, to, stop, work, on, the, novel, after, her, father, died, on, 21, january, 1805, and, her, personal, circumstances, resembled, those, of, her, characters, too, closely, for, her, comfort, her, father, s, relatively, sudden, death, left, jane, cassandra, and, their, mother, in, a, precarious, financial, situation, edward, james, henry, and, francis, austen, known, as, frank, pledged, to, make, annual, contributions, to, support, their, mother, and, sisters, for, the, next, four, years, the, family, s, living, arrangements, reflected, their, financial, insecurity, they, spent, part, of, the, time, in, rented, quarters, in, bath, before, leaving, the, city, in, june, 1805, for, a, family, visit, to, steventon, and, godmersham, they, moved, for, the, autumn, months, to, the, newly, fashionable, seaside, resort, of, worthing, on, the, sussex, coast, where, they, resided, at, stanford, cottage, it, was, here, that, austen, is, thought, to, have, written, her, fair, copy, of, lady, susan, and, added, its, conclusion, in, 1806, the, family, moved, to, southampton, where, they, shared, a, house, with, frank, austen, and, his, new, wife, a, large, part, of, this, time, they, spent, visiting, various, branches, of, the, family, on, 5, april, 1809, about, three, months, before, the, family, s, move, to, chawton, austen, wrote, an, angry, letter, to, richard, crosby, offering, him, a, new, manuscript, of, susan, if, needed, to, secure, the, immediate, publication, of, the, novel, and, requesting, the, return, of, the, original, so, she, could, find, another, publisher, crosby, replied, that, he, had, not, agreed, to, publish, the, book, by, any, particular, time, or, at, all, and, that, austen, could, repurchase, the, manuscript, for, the, 10, he, had, paid, her, and, find, another, publisher, she, did, not, have, the, resources, to, buy, the, copyright, back, at, that, time, but, was, able, to, purchase, it, in, 1816, around, early, 1809, austen, s, brother, edward, offered, his, mother, and, sisters, a, more, settled, life, the, use, of, a, large, cottage, in, chawton, village, which, was, part, of, the, estate, around, edward, s, nearby, property, chawton, house, jane, cassandra, and, their, mother, moved, into, chawton, cottage, on, 7, july, 1809, life, was, quieter, in, chawton, than, it, had, been, since, the, family, s, move, to, bath, in, 1800, the, austens, did, not, socialise, with, gentry, and, entertained, only, when, family, visited, her, niece, anna, described, the, family, s, life, in, chawton, as, a, very, quiet, life, according, to, our, ideas, but, they, were, great, readers, and, besides, the, housekeeping, our, aunts, occupied, themselves, in, working, with, the, poor, and, in, teaching, some, girl, or, boy, to, read, or, write, like, many, women, authors, at, the, time, austen, published, her, books, anonymously, at, the, time, the, ideal, roles, for, a, woman, were, as, wife, and, mother, and, writing, for, women, was, regarded, at, best, as, a, secondary, form, of, activity, a, woman, who, wished, to, be, a, full, time, writer, was, felt, to, be, degrading, her, femininity, so, books, by, women, were, usually, published, anonymously, in, order, to, maintain, the, conceit, that, the, female, writer, was, only, publishing, as, a, sort, of, part, time, job, and, was, not, seeking, to, become, a, literary, lioness, i, e, a, celebrity, during, her, time, at, chawton, austen, published, four, generally, well, received, novels, through, her, brother, henry, the, publisher, thomas, egerton, agreed, to, publish, sense, and, sensibility, which, like, all, of, austen, s, novels, except, pride, and, prejudice, was, published, on, commission, that, is, at, the, author, s, financial, risk, when, publishing, on, commission, publishers, would, advance, the, costs, of, publication, repay, themselves, as, books, were, sold, and, then, charge, a, 10, commission, for, each, book, sold, paying, the, rest, to, the, author, if, a, novel, did, not, recover, its, costs, through, sales, the, author, was, responsible, for, them, the, alternative, to, selling, via, commission, was, by, selling, the, copyright, where, an, author, received, a, one, time, payment, from, the, publisher, for, the, manuscript, which, occurred, with, pride, and, prejudice, austen, s, experience, with, susan, the, manuscript, that, became, northanger, abbey, where, she, sold, the, copyright, to, the, publisher, crosby, sons, for, 10, who, did, not, publish, the, book, forcing, her, to, buy, back, the, copyright, in, order, to, get, her, work, published, left, austen, leery, of, this, method, of, publishing, the, final, alternative, of, selling, by, subscription, where, a, group, of, people, would, agree, to, buy, a, book, in, advance, was, not, an, option, for, austen, as, only, authors, who, were, well, known, or, had, an, influential, aristocratic, patron, who, would, recommend, an, up, coming, book, to, their, friends, could, sell, by, subscription, sense, and, sensibility, appeared, in, october, 1811, and, was, described, as, being, written, by, a, lady, as, it, was, sold, on, commission, egerton, used, expensive, paper, and, set, the, price, at, 15, shillings, equivalent, to, 69, in, 2023, reviews, were, favourable, and, the, novel, became, fashionable, among, young, aristocratic, opinion, makers, the, edition, sold, out, by, mid, 1813, austen, s, novels, were, published, in, larger, editions, than, was, normal, for, this, period, the, small, size, of, the, novel, reading, public, and, the, large, costs, associated, with, hand, production, particularly, the, cost, of, handmade, paper, meant, that, most, novels, were, published, in, editions, of, 500, copies, or, fewer, to, reduce, the, risks, to, the, publisher, and, the, novelist, even, some, of, the, most, successful, titles, during, this, period, were, issued, in, editions, of, not, more, than, 750, or, 800, copies, and, later, reprinted, if, demand, continued, austen, s, novels, were, published, in, larger, editions, ranging, from, about, 750, copies, of, sense, and, sensibility, to, about, 2, 000, copies, of, emma, it, is, not, clear, whether, the, decision, to, print, more, copies, than, usual, of, austen, s, novels, was, driven, by, the, publishers, or, the, author, since, all, but, one, of, austen, s, books, were, originally, published, on, commission, the, risks, of, overproduction, were, largely, hers, or, cassandra, s, after, her, death, and, publishers, may, have, been, more, willing, to, produce, larger, editions, than, was, normal, practice, when, their, own, funds, were, at, risk, editions, of, popular, works, of, non, fiction, were, often, much, larger, austen, made, 140, equivalent, to, 12, 800, in, 2023, from, sense, and, sensibility, which, provided, her, with, some, financial, and, psychological, independence, after, the, success, of, sense, and, sensibility, all, of, austen, s, subsequent, books, were, billed, as, written, by, the, author, of, sense, and, sensibility, and, austen, s, name, never, appeared, on, her, books, during, her, lifetime, egerton, then, published, pride, and, prejudice, a, revision, of, first, impressions, in, january, 1813, austen, sold, the, copyright, to, pride, and, prejudice, to, egerton, for, 110, equivalent, to, 9, 100, in, 2023, to, maximise, profits, he, used, cheap, paper, and, set, the, price, at, 18, shillings, equivalent, to, 74, in, 2023, he, advertised, the, book, widely, and, it, was, an, immediate, success, garnering, three, favourable, reviews, and, selling, well, had, austen, sold, pride, and, prejudice, on, commission, she, would, have, made, a, profit, of, 475, or, twice, her, father, s, annual, income, by, october, 1813, egerton, was, able, to, begin, selling, a, second, edition, mansfield, park, was, published, by, egerton, in, may, 1814, while, mansfield, park, was, ignored, by, reviewers, it, was, very, popular, with, readers, all, copies, were, sold, within, six, months, and, austen, s, earnings, on, this, novel, were, larger, than, for, any, of, her, other, novels, without, austen, s, knowledge, or, approval, her, novels, were, translated, into, french, and, published, in, cheaply, produced, pirated, editions, in, france, 1, 2, the, literary, critic, noel, king, commented, in, 1953, that, given, the, prevailing, rage, in, france, at, the, time, for, lush, romantic, fantasies, it, was, remarkable, that, her, novels, with, the, emphasis, on, everyday, english, life, had, any, sort, of, a, market, in, france, 2, king, cautioned, that, austen, s, chief, translator, in, france, madame, isabelle, de, montolieu, had, only, the, most, rudimentary, knowledge, of, english, and, her, translations, were, more, of, imitations, than, translations, proper, as, montolieu, depended, upon, assistants, to, provide, a, summary, which, she, then, translated, into, an, embellished, french, that, often, radically, altered, austen, s, plots, and, characters, 5, 6, the, first, of, the, austen, novels, to, be, published, that, credited, her, as, the, author, was, in, france, when, persuasion, was, published, in, 1821, as, la, famille, elliot, ou, l, ancienne, inclination, 5, austen, learned, that, the, prince, regent, admired, her, novels, and, kept, a, set, at, each, of, his, residences, in, november, 1815, the, prince, regent, s, librarian, james, stanier, clarke, invited, austen, to, visit, the, prince, s, london, residence, and, hinted, austen, should, dedicate, the, forthcoming, emma, to, the, prince, though, austen, disapproved, of, the, prince, regent, she, could, scarcely, refuse, the, request, austen, disapproved, of, the, prince, regent, on, the, account, of, his, womanising, gambling, drinking, spendthrift, ways, and, generally, disreputable, behaviour, she, later, wrote, plan, of, a, novel, according, to, hints, from, various, quarters, a, satiric, outline, of, the, perfect, novel, based, on, the, librarian, s, many, suggestions, for, a, future, austen, novel, austen, was, greatly, annoyed, by, clarke, s, often, pompous, literary, advice, and, the, plan, of, a, novel, parodying, clarke, was, intended, as, her, revenge, for, all, of, the, unwanted, letters, she, had, received, from, the, royal, librarian, in, mid, 1815, austen, moved, her, work, from, egerton, to, john, murray, a, better, known, london, publisher, who, published, emma, in, december, 1815, and, a, second, edition, of, mansfield, park, in, february, 1816, emma, sold, well, but, the, new, edition, of, mansfield, park, did, poorly, and, this, failure, offset, most, of, the, income, from, emma, these, were, the, last, of, austen, s, novels, to, be, published, during, her, lifetime, while, murray, prepared, emma, for, publication, austen, began, the, elliots, later, published, as, persuasion, she, completed, her, first, draft, in, july, 1816, in, addition, shortly, after, the, publication, of, emma, henry, austen, repurchased, the, copyright, for, susan, from, crosby, austen, was, forced, to, postpone, publishing, either, of, these, completed, novels, by, family, financial, troubles, henry, austen, s, bank, failed, in, march, 1816, depriving, him, of, all, of, his, assets, leaving, him, deeply, in, debt, and, costing, edward, james, and, frank, austen, large, sums, henry, and, frank, could, no, longer, afford, the, contributions, they, had, made, to, support, their, mother, and, sisters, austen, was, feeling, unwell, by, early, 1816, but, ignored, the, warning, signs, by, the, middle, of, that, year, her, decline, was, unmistakable, and, she, began, a, slow, irregular, deterioration, the, majority, of, biographers, rely, on, zachary, cope, s, 1964, retrospective, diagnosis, and, list, her, cause, of, death, as, addison, s, disease, although, her, final, illness, has, also, been, described, as, resulting, from, hodgkin, s, lymphoma, when, her, uncle, died, and, left, his, entire, fortune, to, his, wife, effectively, disinheriting, his, relatives, she, suffered, a, relapse, writing, i, am, ashamed, to, say, that, the, shock, of, my, uncle, s, will, brought, on, a, relapse, but, a, weak, body, must, excuse, weak, nerves, austen, continued, to, work, in, spite, of, her, illness, dissatisfied, with, the, ending, of, the, elliots, she, rewrote, the, final, two, chapters, which, she, finished, on, 6, august, 1816, in, january, 1817, austen, began, the, brothers, titled, sanditon, when, published, in, 1925, completing, twelve, chapters, before, stopping, work, in, mid, march, 1817, probably, due, to, illness, todd, describes, sanditon, s, heroine, diana, parker, as, an, energetic, invalid, in, the, novel, austen, mocked, hypochondriacs, and, although, she, describes, the, heroine, as, bilious, five, days, after, abandoning, the, novel, she, wrote, of, herself, that, she, was, turning, every, wrong, colour, and, living, chiefly, on, the, sofa, she, put, down, her, pen, on, 18, march, 1817, making, a, note, of, it, austen, made, light, of, her, condition, describing, it, as, bile, and, rheumatism, as, her, illness, progressed, she, experienced, difficulty, walking, and, lacked, energy, by, mid, april, she, was, confined, to, bed, in, may, cassandra, and, henry, brought, her, to, winchester, for, treatment, by, which, time, she, suffered, agonising, pain, and, welcomed, death, austen, died, in, winchester, on, 18, july, 1817, at, the, age, of, 41, henry, through, his, clerical, connections, arranged, for, his, sister, to, be, buried, in, the, north, aisle, of, the, nave, of, winchester, cathedral, the, epitaph, composed, by, her, brother, james, praises, austen, s, personal, qualities, expresses, hope, for, her, salvation, and, mentions, the, extraordinary, endowments, of, her, mind, but, does, not, explicitly, mention, her, achievements, as, a, writer, in, the, months, after, austen, s, death, in, july, 1817, cassandra, henry, austen, and, murray, arranged, for, the, publication, of, persuasion, and, northanger, abbey, as, a, set, henry, austen, contributed, a, biographical, note, dated, december, 1817, which, for, the, first, time, identified, his, sister, as, the, author, of, the, novels, tomalin, describes, it, as, a, loving, and, polished, eulogy, sales, were, good, for, a, year, only, 321, copies, remained, unsold, at, the, end, of, 1818, although, austen, s, six, novels, were, out, of, print, in, england, in, the, 1820s, they, were, still, being, read, through, copies, housed, in, private, libraries, and, circulating, libraries, austen, had, early, admirers, the, first, piece, of, fiction, using, her, as, a, character, what, might, now, be, called, real, person, fiction, appeared, in, 1823, in, a, letter, to, the, editor, in, the, lady, s, magazine, it, refers, to, austen, s, genius, and, suggests, that, aspiring, authors, were, envious, of, her, powers, in, 1832, richard, bentley, purchased, the, remaining, copyrights, to, all, of, her, novels, and, over, the, following, winter, published, five, illustrated, volumes, as, part, of, his, standard, novels, series, in, october, 1833, bentley, released, the, first, collected, edition, of, her, works, since, then, austen, s, novels, have, been, continuously, in, print, austen, s, works, implicitly, critique, the, sentimental, novels, of, the, second, half, of, the, 18th, century, and, are, part, of, the, transition, to, 19th, century, literary, realism, the, earliest, english, novelists, richardson, henry, fielding, and, tobias, smollett, were, followed, by, the, school, of, sentimentalists, and, romantics, such, as, walter, scott, horace, walpole, clara, reeve, ann, radcliffe, and, oliver, goldsmith, whose, style, and, genre, austen, repudiated, returning, the, novel, on, a, slender, thread, to, the, tradition, of, richardson, and, fielding, for, a, realistic, study, of, manners, in, the, mid, 20th, century, literary, critics, f, r, leavis, and, ian, watt, placed, her, in, the, tradition, of, richardson, and, fielding, both, believe, that, she, used, their, tradition, of, irony, realism, and, satire, to, form, an, author, superior, to, both, walter, scott, noted, austen, s, resistance, to, the, trashy, sensationalism, of, much, of, modern, fiction, the, ephemeral, productions, which, supply, the, regular, demand, of, watering, places, and, circulating, libraries, yet, her, relationship, with, these, genres, is, complex, as, evidenced, by, northanger, abbey, and, emma, similar, to, william, wordsworth, who, excoriated, the, modern, frantic, novel, in, the, preface, to, his, lyrical, ballads, 1800, austen, distances, herself, from, escapist, novels, the, discipline, and, innovation, she, demonstrates, is, similar, to, his, and, she, shows, that, rhetorically, less, is, artistically, more, she, eschewed, popular, gothic, fiction, stories, of, terror, in, which, a, heroine, typically, was, stranded, in, a, remote, location, a, castle, or, abbey, 32, novels, between, 1784, and, 1818, contain, the, word, abbey, in, their, title, yet, in, northanger, abbey, she, alludes, to, the, trope, with, the, heroine, catherine, anticipating, a, move, to, a, remote, locale, rather, than, full, scale, rejection, or, parody, austen, transforms, the, genre, juxtaposing, reality, with, descriptions, of, elegant, rooms, and, modern, comforts, against, the, heroine, s, novel, fueled, desires, nor, does, she, completely, denigrate, gothic, fiction, instead, she, transforms, settings, and, situations, such, that, the, heroine, is, still, imprisoned, yet, her, imprisonment, is, mundane, and, real, regulated, manners, and, the, strict, rules, of, the, ballroom, in, sense, and, sensibility, austen, presents, characters, who, are, more, complex, than, in, staple, sentimental, fiction, according, to, critic, keymer, who, notes, that, although, it, is, a, parody, of, popular, sentimental, fiction, marianne, in, her, sentimental, histrionics, responds, to, the, calculating, world, with, a, quite, justifiable, scream, of, female, distress, the, hair, was, curled, and, the, maid, sent, away, and, emma, sat, down, to, think, and, be, miserable, it, was, a, wretched, business, indeed, such, an, overthrow, of, everything, she, had, been, wishing, for, such, a, development, of, every, thing, most, unwelcome, example, of, free, indirect, speech, jane, austen, emma, richardson, s, pamela, the, prototype, for, the, sentimental, novel, is, a, didactic, love, story, with, a, happy, ending, written, at, a, time, women, were, beginning, to, have, the, right, to, choose, husbands, and, yet, were, restricted, by, social, conventions, austen, attempted, richardson, s, epistolary, style, but, found, the, flexibility, of, narrative, more, conducive, to, her, realism, a, realism, in, which, each, conversation, and, gesture, carries, a, weight, of, significance, the, narrative, style, utilises, free, indirect, speech, she, was, the, first, english, novelist, to, do, so, extensively, through, which, she, had, the, ability, to, present, a, character, s, thoughts, directly, to, the, reader, and, yet, still, retain, narrative, control, the, style, allows, an, author, to, vary, discourse, between, the, narrator, s, voice, and, values, and, those, of, the, characters, austen, had, a, natural, ear, for, speech, and, dialogue, according, to, scholar, mary, lascelles, few, novelists, can, be, more, scrupulous, than, jane, austen, as, to, the, phrasing, and, thoughts, of, their, characters, techniques, such, as, fragmentary, speech, suggest, a, character, s, traits, and, their, tone, syntax, and, phrasing, rather, than, vocabulary, is, utilised, to, indicate, social, variants, dialogue, reveals, a, character, s, mood, frustration, anger, happiness, each, treated, differently, and, often, through, varying, patterns, of, sentence, structures, when, elizabeth, bennet, rejects, darcy, her, stilted, speech, and, the, convoluted, sentence, structure, reveals, that, he, has, wounded, her, from, the, very, beginning, from, the, first, moment, i, may, almost, say, of, my, acquaintance, with, you, your, manners, impressing, me, with, the, fullest, belief, of, your, arrogance, your, conceit, and, your, selfish, disdain, of, the, feelings, of, others, were, such, as, to, form, that, the, groundwork, of, disapprobation, on, which, succeeding, events, have, built, so, immovable, a, dislike, and, i, had, not, known, you, a, month, before, i, felt, that, you, were, the, last, man, in, the, world, whom, i, could, ever, be, prevailed, on, to, marry, austen, s, plots, highlight, women, s, traditional, dependence, on, marriage, to, secure, social, standing, and, economic, security, as, an, art, form, the, 18th, century, novel, lacked, the, seriousness, of, its, equivalents, from, the, 19th, century, when, novels, were, treated, as, the, natural, vehicle, for, discussion, and, ventilation, of, what, mattered, in, life, rather, than, delving, too, deeply, into, the, psyche, of, her, characters, austen, enjoys, them, and, imbues, them, with, humour, according, to, critic, john, bayley, he, believes, that, the, well, spring, of, her, wit, and, irony, is, her, own, attitude, that, comedy, is, the, saving, grace, of, life, part, of, austen, s, fame, rests, on, the, historical, and, literary, significance, that, she, was, the, first, woman, to, write, great, comic, novels, samuel, johnson, s, influence, is, evident, in, that, she, follows, his, advice, to, write, a, representation, of, life, as, may, excite, mirth, her, humour, comes, from, her, modesty, and, lack, of, superiority, allowing, her, most, successful, characters, such, as, elizabeth, bennet, to, transcend, the, trivialities, of, life, which, the, more, foolish, characters, are, overly, absorbed, in, austen, used, comedy, to, explore, the, individualism, of, women, s, lives, and, gender, relations, and, she, appears, to, have, used, it, to, find, the, goodness, in, life, often, fusing, it, with, ethical, sensibility, creating, artistic, tension, critic, robert, polhemus, writes, to, appreciate, the, drama, and, achievement, of, austen, we, need, to, realize, how, deep, was, her, passion, for, both, reverence, and, ridicule, and, her, comic, imagination, reveals, both, the, harmonies, and, the, telling, contradictions, of, her, mind, and, vision, as, she, tries, to, reconcile, her, satirical, bias, with, her, sense, of, the, good, as, austen, s, works, were, published, anonymously, they, brought, her, little, personal, renown, they, were, fashionable, among, opinion, makers, but, were, rarely, reviewed, most, of, the, reviews, were, short, and, on, balance, favourable, although, superficial, and, cautious, most, often, focused, on, the, moral, lessons, of, the, novels, sir, walter, scott, a, leading, novelist, of, the, day, anonymously, wrote, a, review, of, emma, in, 1815, using, it, to, defend, the, then, disreputable, genre, of, the, novel, and, praising, austen, s, realism, the, art, of, copying, from, nature, as, she, really, exists, in, the, common, walks, of, life, and, presenting, to, the, reader, instead, of, the, splendid, scenes, from, an, imaginary, world, a, correct, and, striking, representation, of, that, which, is, daily, taking, place, around, him, the, other, important, early, review, was, attributed, to, richard, whately, in, 1821, however, whately, denied, having, authored, the, review, which, drew, favourable, comparisons, between, austen, and, such, acknowledged, greats, as, homer, and, shakespeare, and, praised, the, dramatic, qualities, of, her, narrative, scott, and, whately, set, the, tone, for, almost, all, subsequent, 19th, century, austen, criticism, because, austen, s, novels, did, not, conform, to, romantic, and, victorian, expectations, that, powerful, emotion, authenticated, by, an, egregious, display, of, sound, and, colour, in, the, writing, some, 19th, century, critics, preferred, the, works, of, charles, dickens, and, george, eliot, notwithstanding, walter, scott, s, positivity, austen, s, work, did, not, win, over, those, who, preferred, the, prevailing, aesthetic, values, of, the, elite, romantic, zeitgeist, her, novels, were, republished, in, britain, from, the, 1830s, and, sold, steadily, austen, s, six, books, were, included, in, the, canon, making, standard, novels, series, by, publisher, richard, bentley, which, increased, their, stature, that, series, referred, to, her, as, the, founder, of, a, school, of, novelists, and, called, her, a, genius, the, first, french, critic, who, paid, notice, to, austen, was, philar, te, chasles, in, an, 1842, essay, dismissing, her, in, two, sentences, as, a, boring, imitative, writer, with, no, substance, austen, was, not, widely, appreciated, in, france, until, 1878, when, the, french, critic, l, on, boucher, published, the, essay, le, roman, classique, en, angleterre, in, which, he, called, austen, a, genius, the, first, french, author, to, do, so, the, first, accurate, translation, of, austen, into, french, occurred, in, 1899, when, f, lix, f, n, on, translated, northanger, abbey, as, catherine, morland, in, britain, and, north, america, austen, gradually, grew, in, the, estimation, of, both, the, public, and, the, literati, in, the, united, states, austen, was, being, recommended, as, reading, in, schools, as, early, as, 1838, according, to, professor, devoney, looser, philosopher, and, literary, critic, george, henry, lewes, published, a, series, of, enthusiastic, articles, in, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, later, in, the, century, novelist, henry, james, referred, to, austen, several, times, with, approval, and, on, one, occasion, ranked, her, with, shakespeare, cervantes, and, henry, fielding, as, among, the, fine, painters, of, life, the, publication, of, james, edward, austen, leigh, s, a, memoir, of, jane, austen, in, 1869, introduced, austen, s, life, story, to, a, wider, public, as, dear, aunt, jane, the, respectable, maiden, aunt, publication, of, the, memoir, spurred, another, reissue, of, austen, s, novels, editions, were, released, in, 1883, and, fancy, illustrated, editions, and, collectors, sets, quickly, followed, author, and, critic, leslie, stephen, described, the, popular, mania, that, started, to, develop, for, austen, in, the, 1880s, as, austenolatry, around, the, start, of, the, 20th, century, an, intellectual, clique, of, janeites, reacted, against, the, popularisation, of, austen, distinguishing, their, deeper, appreciation, from, the, vulgar, enthusiasm, of, the, masses, in, response, henry, james, decried, a, beguiled, infatuation, with, austen, a, rising, tide, of, public, interest, that, exceeded, austen, s, intrinsic, merit, and, interest, the, american, literary, critic, a, walton, litz, noted, that, the, anti, janites, in, the, 19th, and, 20th, centuries, comprised, a, formidable, literary, squad, of, mark, twain, henry, james, charlotte, bront, d, h, lawrence, and, kingsley, amis, but, in, every, case, the, adverse, judgement, merely, reveals, the, special, limitations, or, eccentricities, of, the, critic, leaving, jane, austen, relatively, untouched, austen, s, works, have, attracted, legions, of, scholars, the, first, dissertation, on, austen, was, published, in, 1883, by, george, pellew, a, student, at, harvard, university, another, early, academic, analysis, came, from, a, 1911, essay, by, oxford, shakespearean, scholar, a, c, bradley, who, grouped, austen, s, novels, into, early, and, late, works, a, distinction, still, used, by, scholars, today, the, first, academic, book, devoted, to, austen, in, france, was, jane, austen, by, paul, and, kate, rague, 1914, who, set, out, to, explain, why, french, critics, and, readers, should, take, austen, seriously, the, same, year, l, onie, villard, published, jane, austen, sa, vie, et, ses, oeuvres, originally, her, phd, thesis, the, first, serious, academic, study, of, austen, in, france, in, 1923, r, w, chapman, published, the, first, scholarly, edition, of, austen, s, collected, works, which, was, also, the, first, scholarly, edition, of, any, english, novelist, the, chapman, text, has, remained, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, published, editions, of, austen, s, works, with, the, publication, in, 1939, of, mary, lascelles, jane, austen, and, her, art, the, academic, study, of, austen, took, hold, lascelles, analyzed, the, books, austen, read, and, their, influence, on, her, work, and, closely, examined, austen, s, style, and, narrative, art, concern, arose, that, academics, were, obscuring, the, appreciation, of, austen, with, increasingly, esoteric, theories, a, debate, that, has, continued, since, the, period, since, world, war, ii, has, seen, a, diversity, of, critical, approaches, to, austen, including, feminist, theory, and, perhaps, most, controversially, postcolonial, theory, the, divide, has, widened, between, the, popular, appreciation, of, austen, particularly, by, modern, janeites, and, academic, judgements, in, 1994, literary, critic, harold, bloom, placed, austen, among, the, greatest, western, writers, of, all, time, in, the, people, s, republic, of, china, after, 1949, writings, of, austen, were, regarded, as, too, frivolous, and, thus, during, the, chinese, cultural, revolution, of, 1966, 69, austen, was, banned, as, a, british, bourgeois, imperialist, in, the, late, 1970s, when, austen, s, works, were, re, published, in, china, her, popularity, with, readers, confounded, the, authorities, who, had, trouble, understanding, that, people, generally, read, books, for, enjoyment, not, political, edification, in, a, typical, modern, debate, the, conservative, american, professor, gene, koppel, to, the, indignation, of, his, liberal, literature, students, mentioned, that, austen, and, her, family, were, tories, of, the, deepest, dye, i, e, conservatives, in, opposition, to, the, liberal, whigs, although, several, feminist, authors, such, as, claudia, johnson, and, mollie, sandock, claimed, austen, for, their, own, cause, koppel, argued, that, different, people, react, to, a, work, of, literature, in, different, subjective, ways, as, explained, by, the, philosopher, hans, georg, gadamer, thus, competing, interpretations, of, austen, s, work, can, be, equally, valid, provided, they, are, grounded, in, textual, and, historical, analysis, it, is, equally, possible, to, see, austen, as, a, feminist, critiquing, regency, era, society, and, as, a, conservative, upholding, its, values, austen, s, novels, have, resulted, in, sequels, prequels, and, adaptations, of, almost, every, type, from, soft, core, pornography, to, fantasy, from, the, 19th, century, her, family, members, published, conclusions, to, her, incomplete, novels, and, by, 2000, there, were, over, 100, printed, adaptations, the, first, dramatic, adaptation, of, austen, was, published, in, 1895, rosina, filippi, s, duologues, and, scenes, from, the, novels, of, jane, austen, arranged, and, adapted, for, drawing, room, performance, and, filippi, was, also, responsible, for, the, first, professional,

dramatisations, released, in, the, 1970s, and, 1980s, attempted, to, adhere, meticulously, to, austen, s, plots, characterisations, and, settings, the, british, critic, robert, irvine, noted, that,
