to, depression, nervousness, and, insomnia, which, made, it, difficult, for, him, to, fulfill, his, duties, as, a, professor, his, condition, forced, him, seek, an, exemption, from, his, teaching, obligations, which, he, was, granted, in, 1899, he, spent, time, in, the, heilanstalt, f, r, nervenkranke, konstanzer, hof, in, 1898, and, in, a, different, sanatorium, in, bad, urach, in, 1900,

1918, weber, thoroughly, described, his, ordeal, with, mental, illness, in, a, personal, chronology, that, his, widow, later, destroyed, its, destruction, was, possibly, caused, by, marianne, s, fear, that, his, work, would, have, been, discredited, by, the, nazis, if, his, experience, with, mental, illness, were, widely, known, after, recovering, from, his, illness, weber, accepted, a, position, as, an, associate, editor, of, the, archiv, f, r, sozialwissenschaft, und, sozialpolitik, in, 1904, alongside, his, colleagues, edgar, jaff, and, werner, sombart, it, facilitated, his, reintroduction, to, academia, and, became, one, of, the, most, prominent, social, science, journals, as, a, result, of, his, efforts, weber, published, some, of, his, most, seminal, works, in, this, journal, including, his, book, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, which, became, his, most, famous, work, and, laid, the, foundations, for, his, later, research, on, the, impact, of, religion, on, the, development, of, economic, systems, also, in, 1904, he, was, invited, to, participate, in, the, congress, of, arts, and, sciences, that, was, held, in, connection, with, the, louisiana, purchase, exposition, in, st, louis, alongside, his, wife, werner, sombart, ernst, troeltsch, and, other, german, scholars, taking, advantage, of, the, fair, the, webers, embarked, on, a, trip, that, began, and, ended, in, new, york, city, and, lasted, for, almost, three, months, they, travelled, throughout, the, country, from, new, england, to, the, deep, south, different, communities, were, visited, including, german, immigrant, towns, and, african, american, communities, north, carolina, was, also, visited, as, some, of, weber, s, relatives, in, the, fallenstein, family, had, settled, there, weber, used, the, trip, to, learn, more, about, america, s, social, economic, and, theological, conditions, and, how, they, related, to, his, thesis, afterwards, he, felt, that, he, was, unable, to, resume, regular, teaching, and, remained, a, private, scholar, helped, by, an, inheritance, in, 1907, shortly, after, returning, weber, s, attention, shifted, to, the, then, recent, russian, revolution, of, 1905, he, learned, the, russian, language, in, a, few, months, subscribed, to, russian, newspapers, and, discussed, russian, political, and, social, affairs, with, the, russian, migr, community, in, heidelberg, he, was, personally, popular, in, that, community, and, twice, entertained, the, idea, of, a, trip, to, russia, his, schedule, prevented, it, however, while, he, was, sceptical, of, the, revolution, s, ability, to, succeed, weber, supported, the, establishment, of, a, liberal, democracy, in, russia, he, wrote, two, essays, on, it, that, were, published, in, the, archiv, weber, interpreted, the, revolution, as, having, been, the, result, of, the, peasants, desire, for, land, he, discussed, the, role, of, the, obshchina, rural, peasant, communities, in, russian, political, debates, according, to, weber, they, were, difficult, for, liberal, agrarian, reformers, to, abolish, due, to, a, combination, of, their, basis, in, natural, law, and, the, rising, kulak, class, manipulating, them, for, their, own, gain, his, general, interpretation, of, the, russian, revolution, was, that, it, lacked, a, clear, leader, and, was, not, based, on, the, russian, intellectuals, goals, instead, it, was, the, result, of, the, peasants, emotional, passions, in, 1909, having, become, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, the, political, conservatism, and, perceived, lack, of, methodological, discipline, of, the, verein, he, co, founded, the, german, sociological, association, deutsche, gesellschaft, f, r, soziologie, and, served, as, its, first, treasurer, weber, associated, the, society, with, the, verein, and, viewed, the, two, organizations, as, not, having, been, competitors, he, unsuccessfully, tried, to, steer, the, direction, of, the, association, as, part, of, that, weber, tried, to, make, the, archiv, its, official, journal, he, resigned, from, his, position, as, treasurer, in, 1912, that, was, caused, by, his, support, for, value, freedom, in, the, social, sciences, as, that, was, a, controversial, position, in, the, association, weber, alongside, simmel, sombart, and, t, nnies, placed, an, abbreviated, form, of, it, into, the, association, s, statutes, prompting, criticism, from, other, members, of, the, association, in, the, same, year, weber, and, his, wife, befriended, a, former, student, of, his, else, von, richthofen, and, the, pianist, mina, tobler, after, a, failed, attempt, to, court, richthofen, weber, began, an, affair, with, tobler, in, 1911, later, during, the, spring, of, 1913, weber, holidayed, in, the, monte, verit, community, in, ascona, switzerland, while, holidaying, he, was, advising, frieda, gross, in, her, custody, battle, for, her, children, he, opposed, erich, m, hsam, s, involvement, because, m, hsam, was, a, anarchist, weber, argued, that, the, case, needed, to, be, dealt, with, by, bourgeois, reformers, who, were, not, derailed, a, year, later, also, in, spring, he, again, holidayed, in, ascona, in, the, community, there, were, several, different, expressions, of, the, then, contemporaneous, radical, political, and, lifestyle, reform, movements, they, included, naturism, free, love, and, western, esotericism, among, others, weber, was, critical, of, the, anarchist, and, erotic, movements, in, ascona, as, he, viewed, their, fusion, as, having, been, politically, absurd, after, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, 1914, weber, volunteered, for, service, and, was, appointed, as, a, reserve, officer, in, charge, of, organising, the, army, hospitals, in, heidelberg, a, role, he, fulfilled, until, the, end, of, 1915, his, views, on, the, war, and, the, expansion, of, the, german, empire, changed, over, the, course, of, the, conflict, early, on, he, supported, the, german, war, effort, with, some, hesitation, viewing, the, war, as, having, been, necessary, to, fulfill, germany, s, duty, as, a, leading, state, power, in, time, however, weber, became, one, of, the, most, prominent, critics, of, both, german, expansionism, and, the, kaiser, s, war, policies, he, publicly, criticised, germany, s, potential, annexation, of, belgium, and, unrestricted, submarine, warfare, later, supporting, calls, for, constitutional, reform, democratisation, and, universal, suffrage, his, younger, brother, karl, an, architect, was, killed, near, brest, litovsk, in, 1915, while, fighting, in, the, war, weber, had, previously, viewed, him, negatively, but, his, death, made, him, feel, more, connected, to, him, he, and, his, wife, also, participated, in, the, 1917, lauenstein, conferences, that, were, held, at, lauenstein, castle, in, bavaria, these, conferences, were, planned, by, the, publisher, eugen, diederichs, and, brought, together, intellectuals, including, theodor, heuss, ernst, toller, and, werner, sombart, weber, s, presence, elevated, his, profile, in, germany, and, served, to, dispel, some, of, the, event, s, romantic, atmosphere, after, he, spoke, at, the, first, one, he, became, involved, in, the, planning, for, the, second, one, as, diederichs, thought, that, the, conferences, needed, someone, who, could, serve, as, an, oppositional, figure, in, this, capacity, he, argued, against, the, political, romanticism, that, max, maurenbrecher, a, former, theologian, espoused, weber, also, opposed, what, he, saw, as, the, excessive, rhetoric, of, the, youth, groups, and, nationalists, at, lauenstein, instead, supporting, the, democratisation, of, germany, for, weber, and, the, younger, participants, the, romantic, intent, of, the, conferences, was, irrelevant, to, the, determination, of, germany, s, future, in, november, shortly, after, the, second, conference, weber, was, invited, by, the, free, student, youth, a, student, organisation, to, give, a, lecture, in, munich, resulting, in, science, as, a, vocation, in, it, he, argued, that, an, inner, calling, and, specialisation, were, necessary, for, one, to, become, a, scholar, weber, also, began, a, sadomasochistic, affair, with, else, von, richthofen, the, next, year, meanwhile, she, was, simultaneously, conducting, an, affair, with, his, brother, alfred, max, weber, s, affairs, with, richtofen, and, mina, tobler, lasted, until, his, death, in, 1920, after, the, war, ended, weber, unsuccessfully, ran, for, a, seat, in, the, weimar, national, assembly, in, january, 1919, as, a, member, of, the, liberal, german, democratic, party, which, he, had, co, founded, he, also, advised, the, national, assembly, in, its, drafting, of, the, weimar, constitution, while, he, was, campaigning, for, his, party, weber, critiqued, the, left, and, complained, about, karl, liebknecht, and, rosa, luxemburg, who, led, the, leftist, spartacus, league, he, regarded, the, german, revolution, of, 1918, 1919, as, having, been, responsible, for, germany, s, inability, to, fight, against, poland, s, claims, on, its, eastern, territories, his, opposition, to, it, may, have, prevented, friedrich, ebert, the, new, president, of, germany, and, a, member, of, the, social, democratic, party, from, appointing, him, as, a, minister, or, ambassador, weber, was, also, critical, of, the, treaty, of, versailles, which, he, believed, unjustly, assigned, war, guilt, to, germany, instead, he, believed, that, many, countries, were, guilty, of, starting, it, not, just, germany, in, making, this, case, weber, argued, that, russia, was, the, only, great, power, that, actually, desired, the, war, he, also, regarded, germany, as, not, having, been, culpable, for, its, invasion, of, belgium, viewing, belgian, neutrality, as, having, obscured, an, alliance, with, france, overall, weber, s, political, efforts, were, largely, unsuccessful, with, the, exception, of, his, support, for, a, democratically, elected, and, strong, presidency, on, 28, january, 1919, after, his, electoral, defeat, weber, delivered, a, lecture, titled, politics, as, a, vocation, which, commented, on, the, subject, of, politics, it, was, prompted, by, the, early, weimar, republic, s, political, turmoil, and, was, requested, by, the, free, student, youth, shortly, before, he, left, to, join, the, delegation, in, versailles, on, 13, may, 1919, weber, used, his, connections, with, the, german, national, people, s, party, s, deputies, to, meet, with, erich, ludendorff, he, spent, several, hours, unsuccessfully, trying, to, convince, ludendorff, to, surrender, himself, to, the, allies, this, debate, also, shifted, to, other, subjects, such, as, who, was, culpable, for, germany, s, defeat, in, the, war, weber, thought, that, the, german, high, command, had, failed, while, ludendorff, regarded, weber, as, a, supporter, of, democracy, who, was, partially, responsible, for, the, revolution, weber, tried, to, disabuse, him, of, that, notion, by, expressing, support, for, a, democratic, system, with, a, strong, executive, since, he, held, ludendorff, responsible, for, germany, s, defeat, in, the, war, and, having, sent, many, young, germans, to, die, on, the, battlefield, weber, thought, that, he, should, surrender, himself, and, become, a, political, martyr, however, ludendorff, was, not, willing, to, do, so, and, wished, to, simply, live, off, of, his, pension, frustrated, with, politics, weber, resumed, teaching, first, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, 1918, then, at, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, in, 1919, in, vienna, weber, filled, a, previously, vacant, chair, in, political, economy, that, he, had, been, in, consideration, for, since, october, 1917, later, in, munich, he, was, appointed, to, lujo, brentano, s, chair, in, social, science, economic, history, and, political, economy, he, accepted, the, appointment, in, order, to, be, closer, to, his, mistress, else, von, richthofen, responding, to, student, requests, he, gave, a, series, of, lectures, on, economic, history, the, student, transcriptions, of, it, were, later, edited, and, published, as, the, general, economic, history, by, siegmund, hellmann, and, melchior, palyi, in, 1923, in, terms, of, politics, he, opposed, the, pardoning, of, the, bavarian, minister, president, kurt, eisner, s, murderer, anton, graf, von, arco, auf, valley, in, response, to, that, right, wing, students, disrupted, his, classes, and, protested, in, front, of, his, home, in, early, 1920, weber, gave, a, seminar, that, contained, a, discussion, of, oswald, spengler, s, the, decline, of, the, west, weber, respected, him, and, privately, described, him, as, having, been, a, very, brilliant, and, scholarly, dilettante, that, seminar, provoked, some, of, his, students, who, knew, spengler, personally, to, suggest, that, he, debate, spengler, alongside, other, scholars, they, met, in, the, munich, town, hall, and, debated, for, two, days, the, audience, was, primarily, young, germans, with, different, political, perspectives, including, communists, while, neither, weber, nor, spengler, were, able, to, convince, the, other, of, their, points, weber, was, more, cautious, and, careful, in, his, arguments, against, spengler, than, the, other, debaters, were, afterwards, the, students, did, not, feel, that, the, question, of, how, to, resolve, the, issues, that, germany, faced, after, the, end, of, the, first, world, war, had, been, answered, lili, sch, fer, one, of, weber, s, sisters, committed, suicide, on, 7, april, 1920, after, the, pedagogue, paul, geheeb, ended, his, affair, with, her, weber, thought, positively, of, it, as, he, thought, that, it, was, justified, and, that, suicide, could, be, an, honourable, act, weber, and, his, wife, took, in, lili, s, four, children, and, planned, to, raise, them, he, was, uncomfortable, with, his, newfound, role, as, a, father, figure, but, he, thought, that, marianne, was, fulfilled, as, a, woman, by, this, event, she, later, formally, adopted, them, in, 1928, weber, wished, for, her, to, stay, with, the, children, in, heidelberg, or, move, closer, to, geheeb, s, odenwaldschule, odenwald, school, so, that, he, could, be, alone, in, munich, with, his, mistress, else, von, richthofen, he, left, the, decision, to, marianne, but, she, said, that, only, he, could, make, the, decision, to, leave, for, himself, while, this, was, occurring, weber, began, to, believe, that, own, life, had, reached, its, end, on, 4, june, 1920, weber, s, students, were, informed, that, he, had, a, cold, and, needed, to, cancel, classes, by, 14, june, 1920, the, cold, had, turned, into, influenza, and, he, died, of, pneumonia, in, munich, he, had, likely, contracted, the, spanish, flu, and, been, subjected, to, insufficient, medical, care, else, von, richthofen, who, was, present, by, his, deathbed, alongside, his, wife, thought, that, he, could, have, survived, his, illness, if, he, had, been, given, better, treatment, his, body, was, cremated, in, the, munich, ostfriedhof, after, a, secular, ceremony, and, the, urn, that, contained, his, ashes, was, later, buried, in, the, heidelberg, bergfriedhof, in, 1921, the, funeral, service, was, attended, by, his, students, including, eduard, baumgarten, and, karl, loewenstein, and, fellow, scholars, such, as, lujo, brentano, at, the, time, of, his, death, weber, had, not, finished, writing, economy, and, society, his, magnum, opus, on, sociological, theory, his, widow, marianne, helped, prepare, it, for, its, publication, in, 1922, she, later, published, a, biography, of, her, late, husband, in, 1926, which, became, one, of, the, central, historical, accounts, of, his, life, weber, s, sociology, treated, social, action, as, its, central, focus, he, also, interpreted, it, as, having, been, an, important, part, of, the, field, s, scientific, nature, he, divided, social, action, into, the, four, categories, of, affectional, traditional, instrumental, and, value, rational, action, action, in, his, methodology, he, distinguished, himself, from, mile, durkheim, and, karl, marx, in, that, his, primary, focus, was, on, individuals, and, culture, whereas, durkheim, focused, on, the, society, weber, concentrated, on, the, individual, and, their, actions, i, e, structure, and, action, compared, to, marx, who, argued, for, the, primacy, of, the, material, world, over, the, world, of, ideas, weber, valued, ideas, as, motivating, individuals, actions, he, was, open, to, the, idea, that, social, phenomena, could, have, several, different, causes, and, placed, importance, on, social, actors, interpretations, of, their, actions, the, result, of, what, has, been, said, so, far, is, that, an, objective, treatment, of, cultural, occurrences, in, the, sense, that, the, ideal, aim, of, scientific, work, would, be, to, reduce, the, empirical, to, laws, is, absurd, not, because, as, it, has, often, been, claimed, the, course, of, cultural, processes, or, say, processes, in, the, human, mind, would, objectively, speaking, be, less, law, like, but, for, the, following, two, reasons, 1, knowledge, of, social, laws, does, not, constitute, knowledge, of, social, reality, but, is, only, one, of, the, various, tools, that, our, intellect, needs, for, that, purpose, 2, knowledge, of, cultural, occurrences, is, only, conceivable, if, it, takes, as, its, point, of, departure, the, significance, that, the, reality, of, life, with, its, always, individual, character, has, for, us, in, certain, particular, respects, no, law, can, reveal, to, us, in, what, sense, and, in, what, respects, this, will, be, the, case, as, that, is, determined, by, those, value, ideas, in, the, light, of, which, we, look, at, culture, in, each, individual, case, max, weber, in, the, objectivity, of, knowledge, in, social, science, and, social, policy, 1904, in, terms, of, methodology, weber, was, primarily, concerned, with, the, question, of, objectivity, and, subjectivity, distinguishing, social, action, from, social, behavior, and, noting, that, social, action, must, be, understood, through, the, subjective, relationships, between, individuals, according, to, him, the, study, of, social, action, through, interpretive, means, or, verstehen, to, understand, needed, to, be, based, upon, understanding, the, subjective, meaning, and, purpose, that, individuals, attached, to, their, actions, determining, an, individual, s, interpretation, of, their, actions, required, either, empathically, or, rationally, derived, evidence, weber, noted, that, the, importance, of, subjectivity, in, the, social, sciences, made, the, creation, of, fool, proof, universal, laws, much, more, difficult, than, in, the, natural, sciences, and, that, the, amount, of, objective, knowledge, that, social, sciences, were, able, to, create, was, limited, overall, he, supported, objective, science, as, a, goal, worth, striving, for, but, noted, that, it, was, ultimately, an, unreachable, goal, weber, s, methodology, was, developed, in, the, context, of, wider, debates, about, social, scientific, methodology, the, first, of, which, was, the, methodenstreit, method, dispute, his, position, in, it, was, close, to, historicism, as, he, thought, that, social, actions, were, heavily, tied, to, particular, historical, contexts, furthermore, analysing, social, actions, required, an, understanding, of, the, relevant, individuals, subjective, motivations, therefore, his, methodology, emphasised, the, use, of, comparative, historical, analysis, as, such, he, was, more, interested, in, explaining, how, a, certain, outcome, was, the, result, of, various, historical, processes, than, in, predicting, those, processes, outcome, in, the, future, the, second, debate, that, shaped, weber, s, perspective, on, methodology, was, the, werturteilsstreit, value, judgement, dispute, this, debate, was, held, between, 1909, and, 1914, on, the, subject, of, value, judgements, in, the, social, sciences, it, originated, with, a, debate, in, the, verein, f, r, socialpolitik, between, the, supporters, of, the, idea, that, ethics, was, an, important, consideration, in, the, field, of, economics, and, those, who, opposed, it, weber, s, position, was, that, the, social, sciences, should, strive, to, be, value, free, in, his, view, scholars, and, students, needed, to, avoid, using, their, position, to, promote, political, values, in, the, classroom, science, had, no, part, in, the, choosing, of, values, with, regards, to, economics, he, argued, that, productivity, was, not, a, useful, scientific, concept, as, it, could, impede, the, proper, evaluation, of, economic, phenomena, the, principle, of, methodological, individualism, which, holds, that, social, scientists, should, seek, to, understand, collectivities, solely, as, the, result, of, individual, people, s, actions, can, be, traced, to, weber, the, term, methodological, individualism, was, coined, in, 1908, by, the, austrian, american, economist, joseph, schumpeter, as, a, way, of, referring, to, weber, s, views, on, how, to, explain, social, phenomena, while, his, research, interests, placed, a, strong, emphasis, on, interpreting, economic, history, weber, s, support, of, methodological, individualism, represented, a, break, with, the, historical, school, and, an, agreement, with, the, founder, of, the, austrian, school, carl, menger, in, the, methodenstreit, in, the, first, chapter, of, economy, and, society, he, argued, that, only, individuals, can, be, treated, as, agents, in, a, course, of, subjectively, understandable, action, despite, the, term, s, usage, of, individualism, weber, did, not, interpret, the, individual, as, being, the, true, source, for, sociological, explanations, instead, while, only, individuals, could, engage, in, intentional, action, they, were, not, necessarily, separate, from, the, collective, group, he, interpreted, methodological, individualism, as, having, had, close, proximity, to, verstehende, interpretive, sociology, as, actions, could, be, interpreted, subjectively, similarly, it, was, also, related, to, ideal, types, in, that, it, involved, discussions, of, abstract, and, rational, models, of, human, behaviour, the, ideal, type, was, a, central, concept, in, weber, s, methodology, he, interpreted, them, as, having, been, indispensable, for, it, due, their, taking, of, meaning, into, account, they, are, unique, to, the, social, sciences, the, term, ideal, type, was, derived, from, georg, jellinek, s, use, of, it, weber, outlined, it, in, the, objectivity, of, knowledge, in, social, science, and, social, policy, and, the, first, chapter, of, economy, and, society, the, ideal, types, three, functions, are, the, formulation, of, terminology, classifications, and, hypotheses, the, latter, task, was, of, the, greatest, importance, of, the, three, in, terms, of, their, construction, an, ideal, type, is, a, schematic, that, represents, a, social, action, and, considers, the, role, of, meaning, in, it, by, its, nature, it, was, an, exaggeration, of, the, empirical, situation, through, its, assumption, that, the, involved, individuals, were, rational, had, complete, knowledge, of, their, situation, had, complete, awareness, of, the, situation, were, completely, aware, of, their, actions, and, made, no, errors, this, was, then, contrasted, with, empirical, reality, allowing, the, researcher, to, better, understand, it, however, ideal, types, are, not, direct, representations, of, reality, and, weber, warned, against, interpreting, them, as, such, he, placed, no, limits, on, what, could, be, analysed, through, the, use, of, ideal, types, since, for, him, rational, methodology, and, science, were, synonymous, with, one, another, ideal, types, were, constructed, rationally, weber, believed, that, social, scientists, needed, to, avoid, making, value, judgements, instead, he, wanted, social, scientific, research, to, be, value, free, this, would, give, them, objectivity, but, needed, to, be, combined, with, an, acknowledgement, that, their, research, connected, with, values, in, different, ways, as, part, of, his, support, for, value, freedom, weber, opposed, both, instructors, and, students, promoting, their, political, views, in, the, classroom, he, first, articulated, it, in, his, writings, on, scientific, philosophy, including, the, objectivity, of, knowledge, in, social, science, and, social, policy, and, science, as, a, vocation, weber, was, influenced, by, heinrich, rickert, s, concept, of, value, relevance, rickert, used, it, to, relate, historical, objects, to, values, while, maintaining, objectivity, through, explicitly, defined, conceptual, distinctions, however, weber, disagreed, with, the, idea, that, a, scholar, could, maintain, objectivity, while, ascribing, to, a, hierarchy, of, values, in, the, way, that, rickert, did, however, his, argument, regarding, value, freedom, was, connected, to, his, involvement, in, the, werturteilsstreit, as, part, of, it, he, argued, in, favour, of, the, idea, that, the, social, sciences, needed, to, be, value, free, during, it, he, unsuccessfully, tried, to, turn, the, german, sociological, association, into, a, value, free, organisation, ultimately, that, prompted, his, resignation, from, it, rationalisation, and, the, question, of, individual, freedom, in, an, increasingly, rational, society, was, a, central, theme, in, weber, s, scholarship, this, theme, was, situated, in, the, larger, context, of, the, relationship, between, psychological, motivations, cultural, values, cultural, beliefs, and, the, structure, of, the, society, weber, understood, rationalisation, as, having, resulted, in, increasing, knowledge, growing, impersonality, and, the, enhanced, control, of, social, and, material, life, he, was, ambivalent, towards, rationalisation, weber, admitted, that, it, was, responsible, for, many, advances, particularly, freeing, humans, from, traditional, restrictive, and, illogical, social, guidelines, however, he, also, criticised, it, for, dehumanising, individuals, as, cogs, in, the, machine, and, curtailing, their, freedom, trapping, them, in, the, iron, cage, of, rationality, and, bureaucracy, his, studies, of, the, subject, began, with, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, in, it, he, argued, that, protestantism, s, particularly, calvinism, s, redefinition, of, the, connection, between, work, and, piety, caused, a, shift, towards, rational, efforts, that, were, aimed, at, achieving, economic, gain, in, protestantism, piety, towards, god, was, expressed, through, one, s, secular, vocation, the, religious, principles, that, influenced, the, creation, of, capitalism, became, unnecessary, and, it, became, able, to, propagate, itself, without, them, what, weber, depicted, was, not, only, the, secularisation, of, western, culture, but, also, and, especially, the, development, of, modern, societies, from, the, viewpoint, of, rationalisation, the, new, structures, of, society, were, marked, by, the, differentiation, of, the, two, functionally, intermeshing, systems, that, had, taken, shape, around, the, organisational, cores, of, the, capitalist, enterprise, and, the, bureaucratic, state, apparatus, weber, understood, this, process, as, the, institutionalisation, of, purposive, rational, economic, and, administrative, action, to, the, degree, that, everyday, life, was, affected, by, this, cultural, and, societal, rationalisation, traditional, forms, of, life, which, in, the, early, modern, period, were, differentiated, primarily, according, to, one, s, trade, were, dissolved, j, rgen, habermas, in, the, philosophical, discourse, of, modernity, twelve, lectures, 1990, weber, continued, his, investigation, into, this, matter, in, later, works, notably, in, his, studies, on, bureaucracy, and, on, the, classification, of, legitimate, authority, into, three, ideal, types, rational, legal, traditional, and, charismatic, of, which, rational, legal, was, the, dominant, one, in, the, modern, world, in, these, works, weber, described, what, he, saw, as, society, s, movement, towards, rationalisation, bureaucratic, states, justified, themselves, through, their, own, rationality, and, were, supported, by, expert, knowledge, which, made, them, rational, rationalisation, could, also, be, seen, in, the, economy, with, the, development, of, a, highly, rational, and, calculating, capitalism, capitalism, s, rationality, related, to, its, basis, in, calculation, which, separated, it, from, alternative, forms, of, economic, organization, state, bureaucracy, and, capitalism, served, as, the, twin, pillars, of, the, developing, rational, society, these, changes, eliminated, the, preexisting, traditions, that, relied, on, the, trades, weber, also, saw, rationalisation, as, one, of, the, main, factors, that, set, the, west, apart, from, the, rest, of, the, world, he, also, applied, rationalisation, to, music, in, his, the, rational, and, social, foundations, of, music, in, writing, it, he, was, influenced, by, his, affair, with, the, pianist, mina, tobler, and, a, sense, that, western, music, was, the, only, type, that, had, become, harmonic, while, other, cultures, music, was, more, intense, and, focused, on, hearing, weber, argued, that, music, was, becoming, increasingly, rational, in, his, view, that, resulted, from, new, developments, in, musical, instrument, construction, and, simultaneous, socio, economic, shifts, of, the, different, instruments, players, the, process, of, disenchantment, caused, the, world, to, become, more, explained, and, less, mystical, moving, from, polytheistic, religions, to, monotheistic, ones, and, finally, to, the, godless, science, of, modernity, older, explanations, of, why, events, occurred, relied, on, the, belief, in, supernatural, interference, in, the, material, world, due, to, disenchantment, this, gave, way, to, rational, and, scientific, explanations, for, events, according, to, the, sociology, of, religion, religious, activity, began, with, actions, in, the, material, world, that, people, associated, with, vague, spirits, and, gave, magical, meanings, to, over, time, these, magical, beliefs, became, increasingly, systemised, and, the, spirits, became, gods, that, were, represented, by, symbols, this, increasing, theological, systemisation, resulted, in, polytheism, and, organised, religion, western, monotheism, was, spurred, on, by, increasing, rationality, which, resulted, in, groups, focusing, on, specific, gods, for, political, and, economic, purposes, creating, a, universal, religion, according, to, weber, protestantism, encouraged, an, increased, pursuit, of, rationality, that, led, to, the, devaluing, of, itself, in, turn, this, devaluation, led, to, nihilism, through, its, destruction, of, unifying, values, the, development, of, the, concept, of, the, calling, quickly, gave, to, the, modern, entrepreneur, a, fabulously, clear, conscience, and, also, industrious, workers, he, gave, to, his, employees, as, the, wages, of, their, ascetic, devotion, to, the, calling, and, of, co, operation, in, his, ruthless, exploitation, of, them, through, capitalism, the, prospect, of, eternal, salvation, max, weber, in, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, 1905, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, is, weber, s, most, famous, work, it, was, the, start, of, his, research, on, how, religions, affected, the, development, of, economic, systems, in, the, book, he, put, forward, the, thesis, that, the, protestant, work, ethic, which, was, derived, from, the, theological, ideas, of, the, reformation, influenced, the, development, of, capitalism, weber, was, looking, for, elective, affinities, between, the, protestant, work, ethic, and, capitalism, he, argued, that, the, puritans, religious, calling, to, work, caused, them, to, systematically, obtain, wealth, they, wished, to, prove, that, they, were, members, of, the, elect, who, were, destined, to, go, to, heaven, weber, used, benjamin, franklin, s, personal, ethic, as, described, in, his, advice, to, a, young, tradesman, as, an, example, of, the, protestant, sects, economic, ethic, both, rationalisation, and, the, ideal, type, concepts, that, later, became, central, to, his, scholarship, appeared, in, the, thesis, rationalization, caused, the, west, to, be, trapped, in, the, stahlhartes, geh, use, iron, cage, or, steel, hard, casing, that, was, the, modern, capitalist, economic, order, the, ideal, types, were, representative, figures, or, case, studies, that, represented, concepts, christian, religious, devotion, was, historically, accompanied, by, the, rejection, of, mundane, affairs, including, economic, pursuit, weber, argued, that, the, origin, of, modern, capitalism, was, in, the, religious, ideas, of, the, reformation, according, to, him, certain, types, of, protestantism, notably, calvinism, were, supportive, of, the, rational, pursuit, of, economic, gain, and, the, worldly, activities, that, were, dedicated, to, it, seeing, those, activities, as, having, been, endowed, with, moral, and, spiritual, significance, the, spirit, of, capitalism, was, found, in, the, desire, to, work, hard, in, a, way, that, pleased, the, worker, and, signified, their, worth, and, originally, had, a, basis, in, theology, in, particular, the, protestant, work, ethic, motivated, the, believers, to, work, hard, be, successful, in, business, and, reinvest, their, profits, in, further, development, rather, than, frivolous, pleasures, weber, thought, that, self, restraint, hard, work, and, a, belief, that, wealth, could, be, a, sign, of, salvation, were, representative, of, ascetic, protestantism, they, practiced, inner, worldly, asceticism, and, sought, to, change, the, world, to, better, reflect, their, beliefs, the, notion, of, a, religious, calling, when, combined, with, predestination, meant, that, each, individual, had, to, take, action, to, prove, their, salvation, to, themselves, however, the, success, that, these, religious, principles, created, ultimately, removed, them, as, an, influence, on, modern, capitalism, as, a, result, of, its, creation, of, a, worldly, perspective, as, a, result, the, inheritors, of, that, system, were, entrapped, in, a, socioeconomic, iron, cage, weber, s, work, in, the, field, of, sociology, of, religion, began, with, the, book, the, protestant, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, it, continued, with, the, book, series, the, economic, ethics, of, the, world, religions, which, contained, the, religion, of, china, the, religion, of, india, and, ancient, judaism, however, his, work, was, left, incomplete, as, a, result, of, his, sudden, death, in, 1920, which, prevented, him, from, following, ancient, judaism, with, studies, of, early, christianity, and, islam, the, three, main, themes, within, the, books, were, religious, ideas, effect, on, economic, activities, the, relationship, between, social, stratification, and, religious, ideas, and, the, distinguishable, characteristics, of, western, civilisation, his, goal, was, to, find, reasons, for, the, different, developmental, paths, of, the, cultures, of, the, western, world, and, the, eastern, world, without, making, value, judgements, unlike, the, contemporaneous, social, darwinists, weber, simply, wanted, to, explain, the, distinctive, elements, of, western, civilisation, weber, also, proposed, a, socio, evolutionary, model, of, religious, change, where, societies, moved, from, magic, to, ethical, monotheism, with, the, intermediatory, steps, of, polytheism, pantheism, and, monotheism, according, to, him, this, was, the, result, of, growing, economic, stability, which, allowed, for, professionalisation, and, the, evolution, of, an, increasingly, sophisticated, priesthood, as, societies, grew, more, complex, and, encompassed, different, groups, a, hierarchy, of, gods, developed, meanwhile, as, their, power, became, more, centralised, the, concept, of, a, universal, god, became, more, popular, and, desirable, in, the, religion, of, china, confucianism, and, taoism, weber, focused, on, those, aspects, of, chinese, society, that, were, different, from, those, of, western, europe, especially, those, aspects, that, contrasted, with, puritanism, as, part, of, that, he, questioned, why, capitalism, had, not, developed, in, china, he, focused, on, the, issues, of, chinese, urban, development, chinese, patrimonialism, and, officialdom, and, chinese, religion, and, philosophy, primarily, confucianism, and, taoism, as, the, areas, in, which, chinese, development, significantly, differed, from, the, european, route, according, to, weber, confucianism, and, puritanism, were, superficially, similar, but, were, actually, largely, different, from, one, another, instead, they, were, mutually, exclusive, types, of, rational, thought, each, attempting, to, prescribe, a, way, of, life, based, on, religious, dogma, notably, they, both, valued, self, control, and, restraint, and, did, not, oppose, accumulation, of, wealth, however, both, of, those, qualities, were, simply, means, to, different, final, goals, confucianism, s, goal, was, a, cultured, status, position, while, puritanism, s, goal, was, to, create, individuals, who, were, tools, of, god, according, to, weber, the, puritans, sought, rational, control, of, the, world, and, rejected, its, irrationality, while, confucians, sought, rational, acceptance, of, that, state, of, affairs, therefore, he, stated, that, it, was, the, difference, in, social, attitudes, and, mentality, shaped, by, the, respective, dominant, religions, that, contributed, to, the, development, of, capitalism, in, the, west, and, the, absence, of, it, in, china, in, the, religion, of, india, the, sociology, of, hinduism, and, buddhism, weber, dealt, with, the, structure, of, indian, society, with, the, orthodox, doctrines, of, hinduism, and, the, heterodox, doctrines, of, buddhism, with, modifications, brought, by, the, influence, of, popular, religiosity, and, finally, with, the, impact, of, religious, beliefs, on, the, secular, ethic, of, indian, society, in, weber, s, view, hinduism, in, india, like, confucianism, in, china, was, a, barrier, for, capitalism, the, indian, caste, system, which, developed, in, post, classical, india, and, served, as, the, source, for, legitimate, social, interactions, served, as, a, key, part, of, that, both, hinduism, and, the, brahmins, high, status, upheld, the, caste, system, the, brahmins, used, their, monopoly, on, education, and, theological, authority, to, maintain, their, position, while, hinduism, created, a, psychological, justification, for, it, in, the, form, of, the, cycle, of, reincarnation, a, person, s, position, in, the, caste, order, was, thought, to, have, been, determined, by, one, s, actions, in, their, past, life, as, a, result, advancement, of, the, soul, and, obeying, the, predetermined, order, were, more, important, than, seeking, advancement, in, the, material, world, including, economic, advancement, weber, ended, his, research, of, society, and, religion, in, india, by, bringing, in, insights, from, his, previous, work, on, china, to, discuss, the, similarities, of, the, asian, belief, systems, he, noted, that, these, religions, believers, used, otherworldly, mystical, experiences, to, interpret, the, meaning, of, life, the, social, world, was, fundamentally, divided, between, the, educated, elite, who, followed, the, guidance, of, a, prophet, or, wise, man, and, the, uneducated, masses, whose, beliefs, are, centered, on, magic, in, asia, there, was, no, messianic, prophecy, to, give, both, educated, and, uneducated, followers, meaning, in, their, regular, lives, weber, juxtaposed, such, messianic, prophecies, notably, from, the, near, east, with, the, exemplary, prophecies, found, in, mainland, asia, focused, more, on, reaching, to, the, educated, elites, and, enlightening, them, on, the, proper, ways, to, live, one, s, life, usually, with, little, emphasis, on, hard, work, and, the, material, world, it, was, those, differences, that, prevented, western, countries, from, following, the, paths, of, the, earlier, chinese, and, indian, civilisations, his, next, work, ancient, judaism, was, an, attempt, to, prove, this, theory, in, ancient, judaism, weber, attempted, to, explain, the, factors, that, resulted, in, the, early, differences, between, eastern, and, western, religiosity, he, contrasted, the, innerworldly, asceticism, developed, by, western, christianity, with, the, mystical, contemplation, that, developed, in, india, weber, noted, that, some, aspects, of, christianity, sought, to, conquer, and, change, the, world, rather, than, withdraw, from, its, imperfections, this, fundamental, characteristic, of, christianity, originally, stemmed, from, ancient, jewish, prophecy, weber, classified, the, jewish, people, as, having, been, a, pariah, people, which, meant, that, they, were, separated, from, the, society, that, contained, them, he, examined, the, ancient, jewish, people, s, origins, and, social, structures, in, his, view, the, israelites, maintained, order, through, a, covenant, with, the, war, god, yahweh, and, the, practice, of, warrior, asceticism, under, solomon, that, changed, into, a, more, organised, and, law, based, society, than, the, old, confederation, was, religiously, the, priests, replaced, the, previous, charismatic, religious, leaders, weber, thought, that, elijah, was, the, first, prophet, to, have, risen, from, the, shepherds, elijah, promulgated, political, prophecies, and, opposed, the, monarchy, weber, used, the, concept, of, theodicy, in, his, interpretation, of, theology, and, religion, throughout, his, corpus, this, involved, both, his, scholarly, and, personal, interests, in, the, subject, it, was, central, to, his, conception, of, humanity, which, he, interpreted, as, having, been, connected, with, finding, meaning, theodicy, was, a, popular, subject, of, study, amongst, german, scholars, who, sought, to, determine, how, a, world, created, by, an, omnibenevolent, and, omnipotent, being, can, contain, suffering, as, part, of, this, tradition, weber, was, careful, in, his, study, of, the, subject, rather, than, interpreting, it, through, a, theological, or, ethical, lens, he, interpreted, it, through, a, social, one, furthermore, he, incorporated, friedrich, nietzsche, s, concept, of, ressentiment, into, his, discussion, of, the, topic, however, he, disagreed, with, nietzsche, s, emotional, discussion, of, the, topic, and, his, interpretation, of, it, as, having, been, a, jewish, derived, expression, of, slave, morality, weber, divided, theodicy, into, three, main, types, weber, defined, the, importance, of, societal, class, within, religion, by, examining, the, difference, between, the, theodicies, of, fortune, and, misfortune, and, to, what, class, structures, they, apply, the, theodicy, of, fortune, related, to, the, desire, of, those, who, were, successful, to, prove, that, they, deserved, it, they, were, also, prone, to, not, being, satisfied, with, what, they, already, had, and, wished, to, avoid, the, notion, that, they, were, illegitimate, or, sinful, those, without, the, work, ethic, believed, in, the, theodicy, of, misfortune, believing, wealth, and, happiness, were, granted, in, the, afterlife, another, example, of, how, this, belief, of, religious, theodicy, influenced, class, was, that, those, of, lower, economic, status, tended, towards, deep, religiousness, and, faith, as, a, way, to, comfort, themselves, and, provide, hope, for, a, more, prosperous, future, while, those, of, higher, economic, status, preferred, the, sacraments, or, actions, that, proved, their, right, to, possess, greater, wealth, in, political, sociology, one, of, weber, s, most, influential, contributions, is, his, lecture, politics, as, a, vocation, in, which, he, defined, the, state, as, an, entity, that, was, based, on, the, legitimate, use, of, force, accordingly, weber, proposed, that, politics, is, the, sharing, of, state, power, between, various, groups, whereas, political, leaders, were, those, who, wielded, this, power, a, politician, needed, to, combine, the, oppositional, gesinnungsethik, and, verantwortungsethik, the, ethic, of, conviction, and, the, ethic, of, responsibility, an, adherent, of, the, verantwortungsethik, justified, their, actions, based, on, their, consequences, meanwhile, an, adherent, of, the, gesinnungsethik, justified, their, actions, based, on, their, ideals, while, weber, thought, that, both, of, them, would, ideally, be, present, in, a, politician, he, associated, them, with, different, types, of, people, and, mindsets, these, different, types, of, people, and, mindsets, reflected, the, pacifists, and, those, who, wanted, to, reverse, germany, s, defeat, in, the, first, world, war, respectively, weber, distinguished, three, ideal, types, of, legitimate, authority, in, his, view, all, historical, relationships, between, rulers, and, ruled, contained, these, elements, which, could, be, analysed, on, the, basis, of, this, tripartite, classification, of, authority, charismatic, authority, was, held, by, extraordinary, figures, and, was, unstable, as, it, relied, on, the, charismatic, figure, s, success, and, would, resist, institutionalisation, it, was, forced, to, be, routinised, into, more, structured, forms, of, authority, an, administrative, structure, would, be, formed, by, the, charismatic, leader, s, followers, in, an, ideal, type, of, traditional, rule, sufficient, resistance, to, a, ruler, led, to, a, traditional, revolution, traditional, authority, was, based, on, loyalty, to, preestablished, traditions, and, those, who, were, placed, into, authority, as, a, result, of, those, traditions, rational, legal, authority, relied, on, bureaucracy, and, belief, in, both, the, legality, of, the, society, s, rules, and, the, legitimacy, of, those, who, were, placed, into, power, as, a, result, of, those, rules, unlike, the, other, types, of, authority, it, gradually, developed, that, was, the, result, of, legal, systems, not, requiring, charismatic, individuals, or, traditions, in, order, to, exist, weber, s, commentary, on, societal, bureaucratisation, is, one, of, the, most, prominent, parts, of, his, work, according, to, him, bureaucracy, was, the, most, efficient, method, of, societal, organisation, and, the, most, formally, rational, system, it, was, necessary, for, modern, society, to, function, and, would, also, be, difficult, to, destroy, bureaucratic, officials, felt, superior, to, non, bureaucrats, had, a, strong, sense, of, duty, and, had, fixed, salaries, that, caused, them, to, be, disinclined, to, pursue, the, acquisition, of, money, bureaucracy, was, less, likely, to, be, found, among, elected, officials, bureaucracy, suited, capitalism, well, in, that, it, would, treat, all, people, without, regard, for, individuals, it, was, also, a, requirement, for, both, modern, capitalism, and, modern, socialism, to, exist, this, depersonalisation, related, to, its, increased, efficiency, bureaucrats, could, not, openly, make, decisions, arbitrarily, or, base, them, on, personal, favours, as, the, most, efficient, and, rational, way, of, organising, bureaucratisation, was, the, key, part, of, rational, legal, authority, furthermore, he, saw, it, as, the, key, process, in, the, ongoing, rationalisation, of, western, society, weber, listed, six, characteristics, of, an, ideal, type, of, bureaucracy, the, development, of, communication, and, transportation, technologies, made, more, efficient, administration, possible, and, popularly, requested, meanwhile, the, democratisation, and, rationalisation, of, culture, resulted, in, demands, that, the, new, system, treat, everyone, equally, weber, s, ideal, type, of, bureaucracy, was, characterised, by, hierarchical, organisation, delineated, lines, of, authority, in, a, fixed, area, of, activity, action, taken, on, the, basis, of, written, rules, bureaucratic, officials, needing, expert, training, rules, being, implemented, neutrally, and, career, advancement, depending, on, technical, qualifications, judged, by, organisations, while, arguing, that, bureaucracy, was, the, most, efficient, form, of, organisation, and, was, indispensable, for, the, modern, state, weber, was, also, critical, of, it, in, his, view, an, inescapable, bureaucratisation, of, society, would, happen, in, the, future, a, hypothetical, victory, of, socialism, over, capitalism, would, not, be, able, to, prevent, that, future, economic, and, political, organisations, needed, entrepreneurs, and, politicians, in, order, to, counteract, bureaucrats, otherwise, they, would, be, stifled, by, bureaucracy, weber, also, formulated, a, three, component, theory, of, stratification, that, contained, the, conceptually, distinct, elements, of, social, class, social, status, and, political, party, this, distinction, was, most, clearly, described, in, his, essay, the, distribution, of, power, within, the, gemeinschaft, classes, st, nde, parties, which, was, first, published, in, his, book, economy, and, society, status, served, as, one, of, the, central, ways, in, which, people, were, ranked, in, society, as, part, of, it, issues, of, honour, and, prestige, were, important, with, regards, to, class, the, theory, placed, heavy, emphasis, on, class, conflict, and, private, property, as, having, been, key, to, its, definition, while, weber, drew, upon, marx, s, interpretation, of, class, conflict, in, his, definition, of, class, he, did, not, see, it, as, being, the, defining, aspect, of, all, social, relations, and, stratification, political, parties, were, not, given, as, much, attention, by, weber, as, the, other, two, components, were, as, he, thought, that, they, were, not, particularly, effectual, in, their, actions, their, purpose, was, to, seek, power, to, benefit, their, members, materially, or, ideologically, the, three, components, of, weber, s, theory, were, this, conceptualization, emerged, from, weber, s, study, of, farm, labour, and, the, stock, exchange, as, he, found, social, relationships, that, could, not, be, explained, through, economic, class, alone, the, junkers, had, social, rules, regarding, marriage, between, different, social, levels, and, farm, labourers, had, a, strong, sense, of, independence, neither, of, which, was, economically, based, weber, maintained, a, sharp, distinction, between, the, terms, status, and, class, although, non, scholars, tend, to, use, them, interchangeably, in, casual, use, status, and, its, focus, on, honour, emerged, from, the, gemeinschaft, which, denoted, the, part, of, society, where, loyalty, originated, from, class, emerged, from, the, gesellschaft, a, subdivision, of, the, gemeinschaft, that, included, rationally, driven, markets, and, legal, organisation, parties, emerged, from, a, combination, of, the, two, weber, interpreted, life, chances, the, opportunities, to, improve, one, s, life, as, having, been, a, definitional, aspect, of, class, it, related, to, the, differences, in, access, to, opportunities, that, different, people, might, have, had, in, their, lives, the, relationship, between, status, and, class, was, not, straightforward, one, of, them, could, lead, to, the, other, but, an, individual, or, group, could, have, success, in, one, but, not, the, other, towards, the, end, of, his, life, weber, gave, two, lectures, science, as, a, vocation, and, politics, as, a, vocation, at, the, ludwig, maximilian, university, of, munich, that, were, on, the, subject, of, the, scientific, and, political, vocations, the, free, student, youth, a, left, liberal, student, organisation, had, immanuel, birnbaum, invite, him, to, give, the, lectures, in, science, as, a, vocation, he, argued, that, an, inner, calling, was, necessary, for, one, to, become, a, scholar, weber, thought, that, only, a, particular, type, of, person, was, able, to, have, an, academic, career, he, used, his, own, career, as, an, example, of, that, recalling, his, arguments, regarding, the, protestant, work, ethic, weber, stated, that, the, path, forward, in, scholarship, required, the, scholar, to, understand, the, potential, for, a, lack, of, success, and, be, methodical, in, their, research, specialisation, was, also, an, aspect, of, modern, scholarship, that, a, scholar, needed, to, engage, in, disenchantment, and, intellectual, rationalisation, were, major, aspects, of, his, commentary, on, the, scholar, s, role, in, modernity, these, processes, resulted, in, the, value, of, scholarship, being, questioned, weber, argued, that, scholarship, could, provide, certainty, through, its, starting, presumptions, despite, its, inability, to, give, absolute, answers, meanwhile, politics, as, a, vocation, commented, on, the, subject, of, politics, weber, was, responding, to, the, early, weimar, republic, s, political, instability, he, defined, politics, as, having, been, divided, into, three, aspects, passion, judgement, and, responsibility, there, was, also, a, division, between, conviction, and, responsibility, while, these, two, concepts, were, sharply, divided, it, was, possible, for, single, individual, particularly, the, ideal, politician, to, possess, both, of, them, he, also, divided, legitimate, authority, into, the, three, categories, of, traditional, charismatic, and, rational, legal, authority, towards, the, lecture, s, end, he, described, politics, as, having, been, a, slow, powerful, drilling, through, hard, boards, ultimately, weber, thought, that, the, political, issues, of, his, day, required, consistent, effort, to, resolve, rather, than, the, quick, solutions, that, the, students, preferred, the, origin, of, a, rational, and, inner, worldly, ethic, is, associated, in, the, occident, with, the, appearance, of, thinkers, and, prophets, who, developed, in, a, social, context, that, was, alien, to, the, asiatic, cultures, this, context, consisted, of, the, political, problems, engendered, by, the, bourgeois, status, group, of, the, city, without, which, neither, judaism, nor, christianity, nor, the, development, of, hellenistic, thinking, are, conceivable, max, weber, in, the, city, 1921, as, part, of, his, overarching, effort, to, understand, the, unique, development, of, the, western, world, weber, wrote, a, general, study, of, the, european, city, and, its, development, in, antiquity, and, the, middle, ages, titled, the, city, according, to, him, christianity, served, to, break, the, traditional, bonds, of, kinship, by, causing, its, believers, to, participate, in, the, religion, as, individuals, however, the, institutions, that, formed, as, a, result, of, this, process, were, secular, in, nature, he, also, saw, the, rise, of, a, unique, form, of, non, legitimate, domination, in, medieval, european, cities, that, successfully, challenged, the, existing, forms, of, legitimate, domination, traditional, charismatic, and, rational, legal, that, had, prevailed, until, then, in, the, medieval, world, these, cities, were, previously, under, the, jurisdiction, of, several, different, entities, that, were, removed, as, they, became, autonomous, that, process, was, caused, by, the, granting, of, privileges, to, newer, cities, and, the, usurpation, of, authority, in, older, ones, weber, primarily, regarded, himself, as, an, economist, and, all, of, his, professorial, appointments, were, in, economics, but, his, contributions, to, that, field, were, largely, overshadowed, by, his, role, as, a, founder, of, modern, sociology, as, a, political, economist, and, economic, historian, weber, belonged, to, the, german, historical, school, of, economics, represented, by, academics, such, as, gustav, von, schmoller, and, his, student, werner, sombart, while, weber, s, research, interests, were, largely, in, line, with, this, school, his, views, on, methodology, and, marginal, utility, significantly, diverged, from, those, of, the, other, german, historicists, instead, they, were, closer, to, those, of, carl, menger, and, the, austrian, school, of, economics, the, traditional, rivals, of, the, historical, school, the, division, caused, by, the, methodenstreit, caused, weber, to, support, a, broad, interpretation, of, economics, that, combined, economic, theory, economic, history, and, economic, sociology, in, the, form, of, sozial, konomik, social, economics, weber, s, magnum, opus, economy, and, society, is, an, essay, collection, that, he, was, working, on, at, the, time, of, his, death, in, 1920, its, text, was, largely, unfinished, outside, of, the, first, three, chapters, the, first, four, chapters, were, written, between, 1919, and, 1920, but, the, other, chapters, were, generally, written, between, 1909, and, 1914, after, his, death, the, final, organisation, and, editing, of, the, book, fell, to, his, widow, marianne, she, was, assisted, by, the, economist, melchior, palyi, the, resulting, volume, was, published, in, 1922, and, was, titled, wirtschaft, und, gesellschaft, the, composition, includes, a, wide, range, of, essays, dealing, with, weber, s, views, regarding, sociology, social, philosophy, politics, social, stratification, world, religion, diplomacy, and, other, subjects, in, 1956, the, german, jurist, johannes, winckelmann, edited, and, organised, a, revised, fourth, edition, of, economy, and, society, later, editing, a, fifth, edition, of, it, in, 1976, guenther, roth, and, claus, wittich, edited, an, english, translation, of, the, work, in, 1968, it, was, based, on, winckelmann, s, 1956, edition, of, the, text, that, he, had, revised, in, 1964, unlike, other, historicists, weber, accepted, marginal, utility, and, taught, it, to, his, students, his, overall, economic, sociology, was, based, on, it, in, 1908, weber, published, an, article, marginal, utility, theory, and, the, fundamental, law, of, psychophysics, in, which, he, argued, that, marginal, utility, and, economics, were, not, based, on, psychology, as, part, of, that, he, disputed, lujo, brentano, s, claim, that, marginal, utility, reflected, the, form, of, the, psychological, response, to, stimuli, as, described, by, the, weber, fechner, law, he, rejected, the, idea, that, marginal, utility, and, economics, were, dependent, on, psychophysics, in, general, weber, disagreed, with, the, idea, that, economics, relied, on, another, field, he, also, included, a, similar, discussion, of, marginal, utility, in, the, second, chapter, of, economy, and, society, both, marginal, utility, and, declining, utility, s, roles, in, his, writings, were, implied, through, his, usage, of, instrumentally, rational, action, in, that, chapter, like, his, colleague, werner, sombart, weber, regarded, economic, calculation, particularly, double, entry, bookkeeping, as, having, played, a, significant, role, in, rationalisation, and, the, development, of, capitalism, weber, s, preoccupation, with, the, importance, of, economic, calculation, led, him, to, critique, socialism, as, lacking, a, mechanism, to, efficiently, allocate, resources, to, satisfy, human, needs, otto, neurath, a, socialist, thinker, thought, that, prices, would, not, exist, and, central, planners, would, use, in, kind, rather, than, monetary, economic, calculation, in, a, completely, socialised, economy, according, to, weber, this, type, of, coordination, was, inefficient, because, it, was, incapable, of, solving, the, problem, of, imputation, which, related, to, the, difficulties, in, accurately, determining, the, relative, values, of, capital, goods, weber, wrote, that, the, value, of, goods, had, to, be, determined, in, a, socialist, economy, however, there, was, no, clear, method, for, doing, so, in, that, economic, system, planned, economies, were, therefore, irrational, at, approximately, the, same, time, ludwig, von, mises, independently, made, the, same, argument, against, socialism, weber, himself, had, a, significant, influence, on, mises, whom, he, had, befriended, when, they, were, both, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, the, spring, of, 1918, however, mises, ultimately, regarded, him, as, having, been, a, historian, rather, than, an, economist, weber, was, strongly, influenced, by, german, idealism, particularly, by, neo, kantianism, he, was, exposed, to, it, by, heinrich, rickert, who, was, his, professorial, colleague, at, the, university, of, freiburg, the, neo, kantian, belief, that, reality, was, essentially, chaotic, and, incomprehensible, with, all, rational, order, deriving, from, the, way, the, human, mind, focused, its, attention, on, certain, aspects, of, reality, and, organised, the, resulting, perceptions, was, particularly, important, to, weber, s, scholarship, his, opinions, regarding, social, scientific, methodology, showed, parallels, with, the, work, of, contemporary, neo, kantian, philosopher, and, sociologist, georg, simmel, weber, was, also, influenced, by, kantian, ethics, more, generally, which, he, nonetheless, came, to, think, of, as, obsolete, in, a, modern, age, lacking, in, religious, certainties, his, interpretation, of, kant, and, neo, kantianism, was, pessimistic, as, a, result, weber, was, responding, to, the, effect, that, friedrich, nietzsche, s, philosophy, had, on, modern, thought, his, goal, in, the, field, of, ethics, was, to, find, non, arbitrarily, defined, freedom, in, what, he, interpreted, as, having, been, a, post, metaphysical, age, that, represented, a, division, between, the, parts, of, his, thought, that, represented, kantianism, and, nietzscheanism, after, his, debate, with, oswald, spengler, in, 1920, weber, said, that, the, world, was, significantly, intellectually, influenced, by, nietzsche, and, marx, in, the, protestant, work, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, and, science, as, a, vocation, weber, negatively, described, die, letzten, menschen, the, last, men, who, were, nietzschean, specialists, without, spirit, who, he, warned, about, in, both, texts, similarly, he, also, used, nietzsche, s, concept, of, ressentiment, in, his, discussion, of, theodicy, but, he, interpreted, it, differently, weber, disliked, nietzsche, s, emotional, approach, to, the, subject, and, did, not, interpret, it, as, having, been, a, type, of, slave, morality, that, was, derived, from, judaism, while, a, student, in, charlottenburg, weber, read, all, forty, volumes, by, johann, wolfgang, von, goethe, who, later, exerted, an, influence, over, his, methodology, and, concepts, for, him, goethe, was, one, of, the, seminal, figures, in, german, history, in, his, writings, including, the, protestant, work, ethic, and, the, spirit, of, capitalism, weber, quoted, goethe, on, several, occasions, his, usage, of, elective, affinity, in, his, writings, may, have, been, derived, from, goethe, as, one, of, goethe, s, works, used, it, as, its, title, weber, was, also, influenced, by, goethe, s, usage, of, the, greek, daimon, fate, that, concept, influenced, weber, s, perspective, that, one, s, fate, was, inevitable, and, that, one, was, able, to, use, experience, to, create, intellectual, passion, he, thought, that, goethe, his, faust, and, nietzsche, s, zarathustra, were, figures, that, represented, the, bermensch, and, expressed, the, quality, of, human, action, by, ceaselessly, striving, for, knowledge, another, major, influence, in, weber, s, life, was, the, writings, of, karl, marx, and, socialist, thought, in, academia, and, active, politics, while, weber, agreed, with, marx, on, the, importance, of, social, conflict, he, did, not, think, that, it, would, destroy, a, society, if, the, traditions, that, upheld, it, were, valued, more, than, it, was, furthermore, the, thought, that, a, social, conflict, would, have, been, resolvable, within, the, preexisting, social, system, writing, in, 1932, karl, l, with, contrasted, the, work, of, marx, and, weber, arguing, that, both, were, interested, in, the, causes, and, effects, of, western, capitalism, but, they, viewed, it, through, different, lenses, marx, viewed, capitalism, through, the, lens, of, alienation, while, weber, used, the, concept, of, rationalisation, to, interpret, it, weber, also, expanded, marx, s, interpretation, of, alienation, from, the, specific, idea, of, the, worker, who, was, alienated, from, his, work, to, similar, situations, that, involved, intellectuals, and, bureaucrats, scholars, during, the, cold, war, frequently, interpreted, weber, as, having, been, a, bourgeois, answer, to, marx, but, he, was, actually, responding, to, the, issues, that, were, relevant, to, the, bourgeoisie, in, wilhelmine, germany, in, that, regard, he, focused, on, the, conflict, between, rationality, and, irrationality, weber, s, most, influential, work, was, on, economic, sociology, political, sociology, and, the, sociology, of, religion, along, with, karl, marx, and, mile, durkheim, he, is, commonly, regarded, as, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, sociology, he, was, instrumental, in, developing, an, antipositivist, hermeneutic, tradition, in, the, social, sciences, weber, influenced, many, scholars, across, the, political, spectrum, left, leaning, social, theorists, such, as, theodor, w, adorno, max, horkheimer, gy, rgy, luk, cs, and, j, rgen, habermas, were, influenced, by, his, discussion, of, modernity, and, its, friction, with, modernisation, as, part, of, that, his, analysis, of, modernity, and, rationalisation, significantly, influenced, the, frankfurt, school, s, critical, theory, right, leaning, scholars, including, carl, schmitt, joseph, schumpeter, leo, strauss, hans, morgenthau, and, raymond, aron, emphasised, different, elements, of, his, thought, they, placed, importance, on, his, discussion, of, strong, leaders, in, democracy, political, ethic, s, relationship, with, value, freedom, and, value, relativism, and, combatting, bureaucracy, through, politically, based, struggle, the, scholars, who, have, examined, his, works, philosophically, including, strauss, hans, henrik, bruun, and, alfred, sch, tz, have, traditionally, looked, at, them, through, the, lens, of, continental, philosophy, weberian, scholarship, s, beginnings, were, delayed, by, the, disruption, of, academic, life, in, the, weimar, republic, hyper, inflation, caused, weber, s, support, for, parliamentary, democracy, to, be, countered, by, the, decline, the, respect, that, professors, had, for, it, the, alienation, that, they, experienced, from, politics, caused, many, of, them, to, become, pessimistic, and, closer, to, the, historical, viewpoints, espoused, by, oswald, spengler, in, his, the, decline, of, the, west, furthermore, universities, increasingly, came, under, state, control, and, influence, after, the, nazi, party, took, power, that, process, accelerated, the, previously, dominant, style, of, sociology, that, of, alfred, vierkandt, and, leopold, von, wiese, was, largely, replaced, by, a, sociology, that, was, dominated, by, support, for, the, nazis, hans, freyer, and, othmar, spann, were, representative, of, that, movement, while, werner, sombart, began, to, support, collectivism, and, nazism, the, nazi, party, s, rise, had, relegated, weber, s, scholarship, to, a, marginal, position, in, the, germany, academy, however, some, weberian, scholars, had, left, germany, while, this, was, happening, with, most, of, them, settling, in, the, united, states, and, the, united, kingdom, these, scholars, began, to, involve, themselves, in, american, and, british, scholarship, at, a, time, when, weber, s, writings, such, as, the, general, economic, history, were, beginning, to, be, translated, into, english, talcott, parsons, an, american, scholar, was, influenced, by, his, readings, of, weber, and, sombart, as, a, student, in, germany, during,
