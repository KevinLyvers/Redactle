first, day, armstrong, was, tasked, with, piloting, chase, planes, during, releases, of, experimental, aircraft, from, modified, bombers, he, also, flew, the, modified, bombers, and, on, one, of, these, missions, had, his, first, flight, incident, at, edwards, on, march, 22, 1956, he, was, in, a, boeing, b, 29, superfortress, which, was, to, air, drop, a, douglas, d, 558, 2, skyrocket, he, sat, in, the, right, hand, co, pilot, seat, while, pilot, in, command, stan, butchart, sat, in, the, left, hand, pilot, seat, flying, the, b, 29, as, they, climbed, to, 30, 000, feet, 9, km, the, number, four, engine, stopped, and, the, propeller, began, windmilling, rotating, freely, in, the, airstream, hitting, the, switch, that, would, stop, the, propeller, s, spinning, butchart, watched, it, slow, then, resume, spinning, even, faster, than, the, others, if, it, spun, too, fast, it, would, break, apart, their, aircraft, needed, to, hold, an, airspeed, of, 210, mph, 338, km, h, to, launch, its, skyrocket, payload, and, the, b, 29, could, not, land, with, the, skyrocket, attached, to, its, belly, armstrong, and, butchart, brought, the, aircraft, into, a, nose, down, attitude, to,

4, miles, 18, 3, km, on, landing, the, poorly, designed, nose, landing, gear, failed, as, had, happened, on, about, a, dozen, previous, flights, of, the, bell, x, 1b, he, flew, the, north, american, x, 15, seven, times, including, the, first, flight, with, the, q, ball, system, the, first, flight, of, the, number, 3, x, 15, airframe, and, the, first, flight, of, the, mh, 96, adaptive, flight, control, system, he, became, an, employee, of, the, national, aeronautics, and, space, administration, nasa, when, it, was, established, on, october, 1, 1958, absorbing, naca, armstrong, was, involved, in, several, incidents, that, went, down, in, edwards, folklore, or, were, chronicled, in, the, memoirs, of, colleagues, during, his, sixth, x, 15, flight, on, april, 20, 1962, armstrong, was, testing, the, mh, 96, control, system, when, he, flew, to, a, height, of, over, 207, 000, feet, 63, km, the, highest, he, flew, before, gemini, 8, he, held, up, the, aircraft, nose, during, its, descent, to, demonstrate, the, mh, 96, s, g, limiting, performance, and, the, x, 15, ballooned, back, up, to, around, 140, 000, feet, 43, km, he, flew, past, the, landing, field, at, mach, 3, at, over, 100, 000, feet, 30, km, in, altitude, and, ended, up, 40, miles, 64, km, south, of, edwards, after, sufficient, descent, he, turned, back, toward, the, landing, area, and, landed, it, was, the, longest, x, 15, flight, in, both, flight, time, and, length, of, the, ground, track, fellow, astronaut, michael, collins, wrote, that, of, the, x, 15, pilots, armstrong, had, been, considered, one, of, the, weaker, stick, and, rudder, men, but, the, very, best, when, it, came, to, understanding, the, machine, s, design, and, how, it, operated, many, of, the, test, pilots, at, edwards, praised, armstrong, s, engineering, ability, milt, thompson, said, he, was, the, most, technically, capable, of, the, early, x, 15, pilots, bill, dana, said, armstrong, had, a, mind, that, absorbed, things, like, a, sponge, those, who, flew, for, the, air, force, tended, to, have, a, different, opinion, especially, people, like, chuck, yeager, and, pete, knight, who, did, not, have, engineering, degrees, knight, said, that, pilot, engineers, flew, in, a, way, that, was, more, mechanical, than, it, is, flying, and, gave, this, as, the, reason, why, some, pilot, engineers, got, into, trouble, their, flying, skills, did, not, come, naturally, armstrong, made, seven, flights, in, the, x, 15, between, november, 30, 1960, and, july, 26, 1962, he, reached, a, top, speed, of, mach, 5, 74, 3, 989, mph, 6, 420, km, h, in, the, x, 15, 1, and, left, the, flight, research, center, with, a, total, of, 2, 400, flying, hours, on, april, 24, 1962, armstrong, flew, for, the, only, time, with, yeager, their, job, flying, a, t, 33, was, to, evaluate, smith, ranch, dry, lake, in, nevada, for, use, as, an, emergency, landing, site, for, the, x, 15, in, his, autobiography, yeager, wrote, that, he, knew, the, lake, bed, was, unsuitable, for, landings, after, recent, rains, but, armstrong, insisted, on, flying, out, anyway, as, they, attempted, a, touch, and, go, the, wheels, became, stuck, and, they, had, to, wait, for, rescue, as, armstrong, told, the, story, yeager, never, tried, to, talk, him, out, of, it, and, they, made, a, first, successful, landing, on, the, east, side, of, the, lake, then, yeager, told, him, to, try, again, this, time, a, bit, slower, on, the, second, landing, they, became, stuck, provoking, yeager, to, fits, of, laughter, on, may, 21, 1962, armstrong, was, involved, in, the, nellis, affair, he, was, sent, in, an, f, 104, to, inspect, delamar, dry, lake, in, southern, nevada, again, for, emergency, landings, he, misjudged, his, altitude, and, did, not, realize, that, the, landing, gear, had, not, fully, extended, as, he, touched, down, the, landing, gear, began, to, retract, armstrong, applied, full, power, to, abort, the, landing, but, the, ventral, fin, and, landing, gear, door, struck, the, ground, damaging, the, radio, and, releasing, hydraulic, fluid, without, radio, communication, armstrong, flew, south, to, nellis, air, force, base, past, the, control, tower, and, waggled, his, wings, the, signal, for, a, no, radio, approach, the, loss, of, hydraulic, fluid, caused, the, tailhook, to, release, and, upon, landing, he, caught, the, arresting, wire, attached, to, an, anchor, chain, and, dragged, the, chain, along, the, runway, it, took, thirty, minutes, to, clear, the, runway, and, rig, another, arresting, cable, armstrong, telephoned, edwards, and, asked, for, someone, to, collect, him, milt, thompson, was, sent, in, an, f, 104b, the, only, two, seater, available, but, a, plane, thompson, had, never, flown, with, great, difficulty, thompson, made, it, to, nellis, where, a, strong, crosswind, caused, a, hard, landing, and, the, left, main, tire, suffered, a, blowout, the, runway, was, again, closed, to, clear, it, and, bill, dana, was, sent, to, nellis, in, a, t, 33, but, he, almost, landed, long, the, nellis, base, operations, office, then, decided, that, to, avoid, any, further, problems, it, would, be, best, to, find, the, three, nasa, pilots, ground, transport, back, to, edwards, in, june, 1958, armstrong, was, selected, for, the, u, s, air, force, s, man, in, space, soonest, program, but, the, advanced, research, projects, agency, arpa, canceled, its, funding, on, august, 1, 1958, and, on, november, 5, 1958, it, was, superseded, by, project, mercury, a, civilian, project, run, by, nasa, as, a, nasa, civilian, test, pilot, armstrong, was, ineligible, to, become, one, of, its, astronauts, at, this, time, as, selection, was, restricted, to, military, test, pilots, in, november, 1960, he, was, chosen, as, part, of, the, pilot, consultant, group, for, the, x, 20, dyna, soar, a, military, space, plane, under, development, by, boeing, for, the, u, s, air, force, and, on, march, 15, 1962, he, was, selected, by, the, u, s, air, force, as, one, of, seven, pilot, engineers, who, would, fly, the, x, 20, when, it, got, off, the, design, board, in, april, 1962, nasa, sought, applications, for, the, second, group, of, nasa, astronauts, for, project, gemini, a, proposed, two, man, spacecraft, this, time, selection, was, open, to, qualified, civilian, test, pilots, armstrong, visited, the, seattle, world, s, fair, in, may, 1962, and, attended, a, conference, there, on, space, exploration, that, was, co, sponsored, by, nasa, after, he, returned, from, seattle, on, june, 4, he, applied, to, become, an, astronaut, his, application, arrived, about, a, week, past, the, june, 1, 1962, deadline, but, dick, day, a, flight, simulator, expert, with, whom, armstrong, had, worked, closely, at, edwards, saw, the, late, arrival, of, the, application, and, slipped, it, into, the, pile, before, anyone, noticed, at, brooks, air, force, base, at, the, end, of, june, armstrong, underwent, a, medical, exam, that, many, of, the, applicants, described, as, painful, and, at, times, seemingly, pointless, nasa, s, director, of, flight, crew, operations, deke, slayton, called, armstrong, on, september, 13, 1962, and, asked, whether, he, would, be, interested, in, joining, the, nasa, astronaut, corps, as, part, of, what, the, press, dubbed, the, new, nine, without, hesitation, armstrong, said, yes, the, selections, were, kept, secret, until, three, days, later, although, newspaper, reports, had, circulated, since, earlier, that, year, that, he, would, be, selected, as, the, first, civilian, astronaut, armstrong, was, one, of, two, civilian, pilots, selected, for, this, group, the, other, was, elliot, see, another, former, naval, aviator, nasa, selected, the, second, group, that, compared, with, the, mercury, seven, astronauts, were, younger, and, had, more, impressive, academic, credentials, collins, wrote, that, armstrong, was, by, far, the, most, experienced, test, pilot, in, the, astronaut, corps, on, february, 8, 1965, armstrong, and, elliot, see, were, picked, as, the, backup, crew, for, gemini, 5, with, armstrong, as, commander, supporting, the, prime, crew, of, gordon, cooper, and, pete, conrad, the, mission, s, purpose, was, to, practice, space, rendezvous, and, to, develop, procedures, and, equipment, for, a, seven, day, flight, all, of, which, would, be, required, for, a, mission, to, the, moon, with, two, other, flights, gemini, 3, and, gemini, 4, in, preparation, six, crews, were, competing, for, simulator, time, so, gemini, 5, was, postponed, it, finally, lifted, off, on, august, 21, armstrong, and, see, watched, the, launch, at, cape, kennedy, then, flew, to, the, manned, spacecraft, center, msc, in, houston, the, mission, was, generally, successful, despite, a, problem, with, the, fuel, cells, that, prevented, a, rendezvous, cooper, and, conrad, practiced, a, phantom, rendezvous, carrying, out, the, maneuver, without, a, target, the, crews, for, gemini, 8, were, assigned, on, september, 20, 1965, under, the, normal, rotation, system, the, backup, crew, for, one, mission, became, the, prime, crew, for, the, third, mission, after, but, slayton, designated, david, scott, as, the, pilot, of, gemini, 8, scott, was, the, first, member, of, the, third, group, of, astronauts, who, was, selected, on, october, 18, 1963, to, receive, a, prime, crew, assignment, see, was, designated, to, command, gemini, 9, henceforth, each, gemini, mission, was, commanded, by, a, member, of, armstrong, s, group, with, a, member, of, scott, s, group, as, the, pilot, conrad, would, be, armstrong, s, backup, this, time, and, richard, f, gordon, jr, his, pilot, armstrong, became, the, first, american, civilian, in, space, valentina, tereshkova, of, the, soviet, union, had, become, the, first, civilian, and, first, woman, nearly, three, years, earlier, aboard, vostok, 6, when, it, launched, on, june, 16, 1963, armstrong, would, also, be, the, last, of, his, group, to, fly, in, space, as, see, died, in, a, t, 38, crash, on, february, 28, 1966, that, also, took, the, life, of, crewmate, charles, bassett, they, were, replaced, by, the, backup, crew, of, tom, stafford, and, gene, cernan, while, jim, lovell, and, buzz, aldrin, moved, up, from, the, backup, crew, of, gemini, 10, to, become, the, backup, for, gemini, 9, and, would, eventually, fly, gemini, 12, gemini, 8, launched, on, march, 16, 1966, it, was, the, most, complex, mission, yet, with, a, rendezvous, and, docking, with, an, uncrewed, agena, target, vehicle, and, the, planned, second, american, spacewalk, eva, by, scott, the, mission, was, planned, to, last, 75, hours, and, 55, orbits, after, the, agena, lifted, off, at, 10, 00, 00, est, the, titan, ii, rocket, carrying, armstrong, and, scott, ignited, at, 11, 41, 02, est, putting, them, into, an, orbit, from, which, they, chased, the, agena, they, achieved, the, first, ever, docking, between, two, spacecraft, contact, with, the, crew, was, intermittent, due, to, the, lack, of, tracking, stations, covering, their, entire, orbits, while, out, of, contact, with, the, ground, the, docked, spacecraft, began, to, roll, and, armstrong, attempted, to, correct, this, with, the, gemini, s, orbit, attitude, and, maneuvering, system, oams, following, the, earlier, advice, of, mission, control, they, undocked, but, the, roll, increased, dramatically, until, they, were, turning, about, once, per, second, indicating, a, problem, with, gemini, s, attitude, control, armstrong, engaged, the, reentry, control, system, rcs, and, turned, off, the, oams, mission, rules, dictated, that, once, this, system, was, turned, on, the, spacecraft, had, to, reenter, at, the, next, possible, opportunity, it, was, later, thought, that, damaged, wiring, caused, one, of, the, thrusters, to, stick, in, the, on, position, a, few, people, in, the, astronaut, office, including, walter, cunningham, felt, that, armstrong, and, scott, had, botched, their, first, mission, there, was, speculation, that, armstrong, could, have, salvaged, the, mission, if, he, had, turned, on, only, one, of, the, two, rcs, rings, saving, the, other, for, mission, objectives, these, criticisms, were, unfounded, no, malfunction, procedures, had, been, written, and, it, was, possible, to, turn, on, only, both, rcs, rings, not, one, or, the, other, gene, kranz, wrote, the, crew, reacted, as, they, were, trained, and, they, reacted, wrong, because, we, trained, them, wrong, the, mission, planners, and, controllers, had, failed, to, realize, that, when, two, spacecraft, were, docked, they, must, be, considered, one, spacecraft, kranz, considered, this, the, mission, s, most, important, lesson, armstrong, was, depressed, that, the, mission, was, cut, short, canceling, most, mission, objectives, and, robbing, scott, of, his, eva, the, agena, was, later, reused, as, a, docking, target, by, gemini, 10, armstrong, and, scott, received, the, nasa, exceptional, service, medal, and, the, air, force, awarded, scott, the, distinguished, flying, cross, as, well, scott, was, promoted, to, lieutenant, colonel, and, armstrong, received, a, 678, raise, in, pay, to, 21, 653, a, year, equivalent, to, 203, 338, in, 2023, making, him, nasa, s, highest, paid, astronaut, in, armstrong, s, final, assignment, in, the, gemini, program, he, was, the, back, up, command, pilot, for, gemini, 11, having, trained, for, two, flights, armstrong, was, quite, knowledgeable, about, the, systems, and, took, on, a, teaching, role, for, the, rookie, backup, pilot, william, anders, the, launch, was, on, september, 12, 1966, with, conrad, and, gordon, on, board, who, successfully, completed, the, mission, objectives, while, armstrong, served, as, a, capsule, communicator, capcom, following, the, flight, president, lyndon, b, johnson, asked, armstrong, and, his, wife, to, take, part, in, a, 24, day, goodwill, tour, of, south, america, also, on, the, tour, which, took, in, 11, countries, and, 14, major, cities, were, dick, gordon, george, low, their, wives, and, other, government, officials, in, paraguay, armstrong, greeted, dignitaries, in, their, local, language, guarani, in, brazil, he, talked, about, the, exploits, of, the, brazilian, born, aviation, pioneer, alberto, santos, dumont, on, january, 27, 1967, the, day, of, the, apollo, 1, fire, armstrong, was, in, washington, d, c, with, cooper, gordon, lovell, and, scott, carpenter, for, the, signing, of, the, united, nations, outer, space, treaty, the, astronauts, chatted, with, the, assembled, dignitaries, until, 18, 45, when, carpenter, went, to, the, airport, and, the, others, returned, to, the, georgetown, inn, where, they, each, found, messages, to, phone, the, msc, during, these, calls, they, learned, of, the, deaths, of, gus, grissom, ed, white, and, roger, chaffee, in, the, fire, armstrong, and, the, group, spent, the, rest, of, the, night, drinking, scotch, and, discussing, what, had, happened, on, april, 5, 1967, the, same, day, the, apollo, 1, investigation, released, its, final, report, armstrong, and, 17, other, astronauts, gathered, for, a, meeting, with, slayton, the, first, thing, slayton, said, was, the, guys, who, are, going, to, fly, the, first, lunar, missions, are, the, guys, in, this, room, according, to, cernan, only, armstrong, showed, no, reaction, to, the, statement, to, armstrong, it, came, as, no, surprise, the, room, was, full, of, veterans, of, project, gemini, the, only, people, who, could, fly, the, lunar, missions, slayton, talked, about, the, planned, missions, and, named, armstrong, to, the, backup, crew, for, apollo, 9, which, at, that, stage, was, planned, as, a, medium, earth, orbit, test, of, the, combined, lunar, module, and, command, and, service, module, the, crew, was, officially, assigned, on, november, 20, 1967, for, crewmates, armstrong, was, assigned, lovell, and, aldrin, from, gemini, 12, after, design, and, manufacturing, delays, of, the, lunar, module, lm, apollo, 8, and, 9, swapped, prime, and, backup, crews, based, on, the, normal, crew, rotation, armstrong, would, command, apollo, 11, with, one, change, collins, on, the, apollo, 8, crew, began, experiencing, trouble, with, his, legs, doctors, diagnosed, the, problem, as, a, bony, growth, between, his, fifth, and, sixth, vertebrae, requiring, surgery, lovell, took, his, place, on, the, apollo, 8, crew, and, when, collins, recovered, he, joined, armstrong, s, crew, to, give, the, astronauts, practice, piloting, the, lm, on, its, descent, nasa, commissioned, bell, aircraft, to, build, two, lunar, landing, research, vehicles, llrv, later, augmented, with, three, lunar, landing, training, vehicles, lltv, nicknamed, the, flying, bedsteads, they, simulated, the, moon, s, one, sixth, gravity, using, a, turbofan, engine, to, support, five, sixths, of, the, craft, s, weight, on, may, 6, 1968, 100, feet, 30, m, above, the, ground, armstrong, s, controls, started, to, degrade, and, the, llrv, began, rolling, he, ejected, safely, before, the, vehicle, struck, the, ground, and, burst, into, flames, later, analysis, suggested, that, if, he, had, ejected, half, a, second, later, his, parachute, would, not, have, opened, in, time, his, only, injury, was, from, biting, his, tongue, the, llrv, was, completely, destroyed, even, though, he, was, nearly, killed, armstrong, maintained, that, without, the, llrv, and, lltv, the, lunar, landings, would, not, have, been, successful, as, they, gave, commanders, essential, experience, in, piloting, the, lunar, landing, craft, in, addition, to, the, llrv, training, nasa, began, lunar, landing, simulator, training, after, apollo, 10, was, completed, aldrin, and, armstrong, trained, for, a, variety, of, scenarios, that, could, develop, during, a, real, lunar, landing, they, also, received, briefings, from, geologists, at, nasa, after, armstrong, served, as, backup, commander, for, apollo, 8, slayton, offered, him, the, post, of, commander, of, apollo, 11, on, december, 23, 1968, as, apollo, 8, orbited, the, moon, according, to, armstrong, s, 2005, biography, slayton, told, him, that, although, the, planned, crew, was, commander, armstrong, lunar, module, pilot, buzz, aldrin, and, command, module, pilot, michael, collins, he, was, offering, armstrong, the, chance, to, replace, aldrin, with, jim, lovell, after, thinking, it, over, for, a, day, armstrong, told, slayton, he, would, stick, with, aldrin, as, he, had, no, difficulty, working, with, him, and, thought, lovell, deserved, his, own, command, replacing, aldrin, with, lovell, would, have, made, lovell, the, lunar, module, pilot, unofficially, the, lowest, ranked, member, and, armstrong, could, not, justify, placing, lovell, the, commander, of, gemini, 12, in, the, number, 3, position, of, the, crew, the, crew, of, apollo, 11, was, assigned, on, january, 9, 1969, as, armstrong, collins, and, aldrin, with, lovell, anders, and, fred, haise, as, the, backup, crew, according, to, chris, kraft, a, march, 1969, meeting, among, slayton, george, low, bob, gilruth, and, kraft, determined, that, armstrong, would, be, the, first, person, on, the, moon, in, part, because, nasa, management, saw, him, as, a, person, who, did, not, have, a, large, ego, a, press, conference, on, april, 14, 1969, gave, the, design, of, the, lm, cabin, as, the, reason, for, armstrong, s, being, first, the, hatch, opened, inwards, and, to, the, right, making, it, difficult, for, the, lm, pilot, on, the, right, hand, side, to, exit, first, at, the, time, of, their, meeting, the, four, men, did, not, know, about, the, hatch, consideration, the, first, knowledge, of, the, meeting, outside, the, small, group, came, when, kraft, wrote, his, book, methods, of, circumventing, this, difficulty, existed, but, it, is, not, known, if, these, were, considered, at, the, time, slayton, added, secondly, just, on, a, pure, protocol, basis, i, figured, the, commander, ought, to, be, the, first, guy, out, i, changed, it, as, soon, as, i, found, they, had, the, time, line, that, showed, that, bob, gilruth, approved, my, decision, a, saturn, v, rocket, launched, apollo, 11, from, launch, complex, 39a, at, the, kennedy, space, center, on, july, 16, 1969, at, 13, 32, 00, utc, 09, 32, 00, edt, local, time, armstrong, s, wife, janet, and, two, sons, watched, from, a, yacht, moored, on, the, banana, river, during, the, launch, armstrong, s, heart, rate, peaked, at, 110, beats, per, minute, he, found, the, first, stage, the, loudest, much, noisier, than, the, gemini, 8, titan, ii, launch, the, apollo, command, module, was, relatively, roomy, compared, with, the, gemini, spacecraft, none, of, the, apollo, 11, crew, suffered, space, sickness, as, some, members, of, previous, crews, had, armstrong, was, especially, glad, about, this, as, he, had, been, prone, to, motion, sickness, as, a, child, and, could, experience, nausea, after, long, periods, of, aerobatics, apollo, 11, s, objective, was, to, land, safely, on, the, moon, rather, than, to, touch, down, at, a, precise, location, three, minutes, into, the, lunar, descent, armstrong, noted, that, craters, were, passing, about, two, seconds, too, early, which, meant, the, lunar, module, eagle, would, probably, touch, down, several, miles, kilometres, beyond, the, planned, landing, zone, as, the, eagle, s, landing, radar, acquired, the, surface, several, computer, error, alarms, sounded, the, first, was, a, code, 1202, alarm, and, even, with, their, extensive, training, neither, armstrong, nor, aldrin, knew, what, this, code, meant, they, promptly, received, word, from, capcom, charles, duke, in, houston, that, the, alarms, were, not, a, concern, the, 1202, and, 1201, alarms, were, caused, by, executive, overflows, in, the, lunar, module, guidance, computer, in, 2007, aldrin, said, the, overflows, were, caused, by, his, own, counter, checklist, choice, of, leaving, the, docking, radar, on, during, the, landing, process, causing, the, computer, to, process, unnecessary, radar, data, when, it, did, not, have, enough, time, to, execute, all, tasks, the, computer, dropped, the, lower, priority, ones, triggering, the, alarms, aldrin, said, he, decided, to, leave, the, radar, on, in, case, an, abort, was, necessary, when, re, docking, with, the, apollo, command, module, he, did, not, realize, it, would, cause, the, processing, overflows, when, armstrong, noticed, they, were, heading, toward, a, landing, area, that, seemed, unsafe, he, took, manual, control, of, the, lm, and, attempted, to, find, a, safer, area, this, took, longer, than, expected, and, longer, than, most, simulations, had, taken, for, this, reason, mission, control, was, concerned, that, the, lm, was, running, low, on, fuel, on, landing, aldrin, and, armstrong, believed, they, had, 40, seconds, of, fuel, left, including, the, 20, seconds, worth, which, had, to, be, saved, in, the, event, of, an, abort, during, training, armstrong, had, on, several, occasions, landed, with, fewer, than, 15, seconds, of, fuel, he, was, also, confident, the, lm, could, survive, a, fall, of, up, to, 50, feet, 15, m, post, mission, analysis, showed, that, at, touchdown, there, were, 45, to, 50, seconds, of, propellant, burn, time, left, the, landing, on, the, surface, of, the, moon, occurred, several, seconds, after, 20, 17, 40, utc, on, july, 20, 1969, one, of, three, 67, inch, 170, cm, probes, attached, to, three, of, the, lm, s, four, legs, made, contact, with, the, surface, a, panel, light, in, the, lm, illuminated, and, aldrin, called, out, contact, light, armstrong, shut, the, engine, off, and, said, shutdown, as, the, lm, settled, onto, the, surface, aldrin, said, okay, engine, stop, then, they, both, called, out, some, post, landing, checklist, items, after, a, 10, second, pause, duke, acknowledged, the, landing, with, we, copy, you, down, eagle, armstrong, confirmed, the, landing, to, mission, control, and, the, world, with, the, words, houston, tranquility, base, here, the, eagle, has, landed, aldrin, and, armstrong, celebrated, with, a, brisk, handshake, and, pat, on, the, back, they, then, returned, to, the, checklist, of, contingency, tasks, should, an, emergency, liftoff, become, necessary, after, armstrong, confirmed, touch, down, duke, re, acknowledged, adding, a, comment, about, the, flight, crew, s, relief, roger, tranquility, we, copy, you, on, the, ground, you, got, a, bunch, of, guys, about, to, turn, blue, we, re, breathing, again, thanks, a, lot, during, the, landing, armstrong, s, heart, rate, ranged, from, 100, to, 150, beats, per, minute, the, flight, plan, called, for, a, crew, rest, period, before, leaving, the, module, but, armstrong, asked, for, this, to, be, moved, to, earlier, in, the, evening, houston, time, when, he, and, aldrin, were, ready, to, go, outside, eagle, was, depressurized, the, hatch, was, opened, and, armstrong, made, his, way, down, the, ladder, at, the, bottom, of, the, ladder, while, standing, on, a, lunar, module, landing, pad, armstrong, said, i, m, going, to, step, off, the, lm, now, he, turned, and, set, his, left, boot, on, the, lunar, surface, at, 02, 56, utc, july, 21, 1969, then, said, that, s, one, small, step, for, man, one, giant, leap, for, mankind, the, exact, time, of, armstrong, s, first, step, on, the, moon, is, unclear, armstrong, prepared, his, famous, epigram, on, his, own, in, a, post, flight, press, conference, he, said, that, he, chose, the, words, just, prior, to, leaving, the, lm, in, a, 1983, interview, in, esquire, magazine, he, explained, to, george, plimpton, i, always, knew, there, was, a, good, chance, of, being, able, to, return, to, earth, but, i, thought, the, chances, of, a, successful, touch, down, on, the, moon, surface, were, about, even, money, fifty, fifty, most, people, don, t, realize, how, difficult, the, mission, was, so, it, didn, t, seem, to, me, there, was, much, point, in, thinking, of, something, to, say, if, we, d, have, to, abort, landing, in, 2012, his, brother, dean, armstrong, said, that, neil, showed, him, a, draft, of, the, line, months, before, the, launch, historian, andrew, chaikin, who, interviewed, armstrong, in, 1988, for, his, book, a, man, on, the, moon, disputed, that, armstrong, claimed, to, have, conceived, the, line, during, the, mission, recordings, of, armstrong, s, transmission, do, not, provide, evidence, for, the, indefinite, article, a, before, man, though, nasa, and, armstrong, insisted, for, years, that, static, obscured, it, armstrong, stated, he, would, never, make, such, a, mistake, but, after, repeated, listenings, to, recordings, he, eventually, conceded, he, must, have, dropped, the, a, he, later, said, he, would, hope, that, history, would, grant, me, leeway, for, dropping, the, syllable, and, understand, that, it, was, certainly, intended, even, if, it, was, not, said, although, it, might, actually, have, been, there, have, since, been, claims, and, counter, claims, about, whether, acoustic, analysis, of, the, recording, reveals, the, presence, of, the, missing, a, peter, shann, ford, an, australian, computer, programmer, conducted, a, digital, audio, analysis, and, claims, that, armstrong, did, say, a, man, but, the, a, was, inaudible, due, to, the, limitations, of, communications, technology, of, the, time, ford, and, james, r, hansen, armstrong, s, authorized, biographer, presented, these, findings, to, armstrong, and, nasa, representatives, who, conducted, their, own, analysis, armstrong, found, ford, s, analysis, persuasive, linguists, david, beaver, and, mark, liberman, wrote, of, their, skepticism, of, ford, s, claims, on, the, blog, language, log, a, 2016, peer, reviewed, study, again, concluded, armstrong, had, included, the, article, nasa, s, transcript, continues, to, show, the, a, in, parentheses, when, armstrong, made, his, proclamation, voice, of, america, was, rebroadcast, live, by, the, bbc, and,

moon, they, began, their, tasks, of, investigating, how, easily, a, person, could, operate, on, the, lunar, surface, armstrong, unveiled, a, plaque, commemorating, the, flight, and, with, aldrin, planted, the, flag, of, the, united, states, although, armstrong, had, wanted, the, flag, to, be, draped, on, the, flagpole, it, was, decided, to, use, a, metal, rod, to, hold, it, horizontally,

spoke, to, them, by, telephone, from, his, office, he, spoke, for, about, a, minute, after, which, armstrong, responded, for, about, thirty, seconds, in, the, apollo, 11, photographic, record, there, are, only, five, images, of, armstrong, partly, shown, or, reflected, the, mission, was, planned, to, the, minute, with, the, majority, of, photographic, tasks, performed, by, armstrong, with, the,

nasa, limited, their, moon, walk, because, they, were, unsure, how, the, space, suits, would, cope, with, the, moon, s, extremely, high, temperature, after, they, re, entered, the, lm, the, hatch, was, closed, and, sealed, while, preparing, for, liftoff, armstrong, and, aldrin, discovered, that, in, their, bulky, space, suits, they, had, broken, the, ignition, switch, for, the, ascent, engine, using, part, of, a, pen, they, pushed, in, the, circuit, breaker, to, start, the, launch, sequence, the, eagle, then, continued, to, its, rendezvous, in, lunar, orbit, where, it, docked, with, columbia, the, command, and, service, module, the, three, astronauts, returned, to, earth, and, splashed, down, in, the, pacific, ocean, to, be, picked, up, by, the, uss, hornet, after, being,

present, a, talk, at, the, 13th, annual, conference, of, the, international, committee, on, space, research, after, arriving, in, leningrad, from, poland, he, traveled, to, moscow, where, he, met, premier, alexei, kosygin, armstrong, was, the, first, westerner, to, see, the, supersonic, tupolev, tu, 144, and, was, given, a, tour, of, the, yuri, gagarin, cosmonaut, training, center, which, he, described, as, a, bit, victorian, in, nature, at, the, end, of, the, day, he, was, surprised, to, view, a, delayed, video, of, the, launch, of, soyuz, 9, as, it, had, not, occurred, to, armstrong, that, the, mission, was, taking, place, even, though, valentina, tereshkova, had, been, his, host, and, her, husband, andriyan, nikolayev, was, on, board, shortly, after, apollo, 11, armstrong,

of, cincinnati, having, chosen, cincinnati, over, other, universities, including, his, alma, mater, purdue, because, cincinnati, had, a, small, aerospace, department, and, said, he, hoped, the, faculty, there, would, not, be, annoyed, that, he, came, straight, into, a, professorship, with, only, a, usc, master, s, degree, he, began, his, master, s, degree, while, stationed, at, edwards, years, before, and, completed, it, after, apollo, 11, by, presenting, a, report, on, various, aspects, of, apollo, instead, of, a, thesis, on, the, simulation, of, hypersonic, flight, at, cincinnati, armstrong, was, university, professor, of, aerospace, engineering, he, took, a, heavy, teaching, load, taught, core, classes, and, created, two, graduate, level, classes, aircraft, design, and, experimental, flight, mechanics, he, was, considered, a, good, teacher, and, a, tough, grader, his, research, activities, during, this, time, did, not, involve, his, work, at, nasa, as, he, did, not, want, to, give, the, appearance, of, favoritism, he, later, regretted, the, decision, after, teaching, for, eight, years, armstrong, resigned, in, 1980, when, the, university, changed, from, an, independent, municipal, university, to, a, state, school, bureaucracy, increased, he, did, not, want, to, be, a, part, of, the, faculty, collective, bargaining, group, so, he, decided, to, teach, half, time, according, to, armstrong, he, had, the, same, amount, of, work, but, received, half, his, salary, in, 1979, less, than, 10, of, his, income, came, from, his, university, salary, employees,

the, mission, he, produced, a, detailed, chronology, of, the, flight, he, determined, that, a, 28, volt, thermostat, switch, in, an, oxygen, tank, which, was, supposed, to, have, been, replaced, with, a, 65, volt, version, led, to, the, explosion, cortright, s, report, recommended, the, entire, tank, be, redesigned, at, a, cost, of, 40, million, many, nasa, managers, including, armstrong, opposed, the, recommendation, since, only, the, thermostat, switch, had, caused, the, problem, they, lost, the, argument, and, the, tanks, were, redesigned, in, 1986, president, ronald, reagan, asked, armstrong, to, join, the, rogers, commission, investigating, the, space, shuttle, challenger, disaster, armstrong, was, made, vice, chairman, of, the, commission, and, held, private, interviews, with, contacts, he, had, developed, over, the, years, to, help, determine, the, cause, of, the, disaster, he, helped, limit, the, committee, s, recommendations, to, nine, believing, that, if, there, were,

1985, armstrong, said, he, was, curious, to, see, what, it, looked, like, from, the, ground, as, he, had, seen, it, only, from, the, moon, he, did, not, inform, the, media, of, the, trip, preferring, to, keep, it, private, armstrong, s, family, described, him, as, a, reluctant, american, hero, he, kept, a, low, profile, later, in, his, life, leading, to, the, belief, that, he, was, a, recluse, recalling, armstrong, s, humility, john, glenn, the, first, american, to, orbit, earth, told, cnn, didn, t, feel, that, he, should, be, out, huckstering, himself, he, was, a, humble, person, and, that, s, the, way, he, remained, after, his, lunar, flight, as, well, as, before, armstrong, turned, down, most, requests, for, interviews, and, public, appearances, michael, collins, said, in, his, book, carrying, the, fire, that, when, armstrong, moved, to, a, dairy, farm, to, become, a, college, professor, it, was, like, he, retreated, to, his, castle, and, pulled, up, the, drawbridge, armstrong, found, this, amusing, and, said, those, of, us, that, live, out, in, the, hinterlands, think, that, people, that, live, inside, the, beltway, are, the, ones, that, have, the, problems, andrew, chaikin, says, in, a, man, on, the, moon, that, armstrong, kept, a, low, profile, but, was, not, a, recluse, citing, his, participation, in, interviews, advertisements, for, chrysler, and, hosting, a, cable, television, series, between, 1991, and, 1993, he, hosted, first, flights, with, neil, armstrong, an, aviation, history, documentary, series, on, a, e, in, 2010, armstrong, voiced,

the, american, flag, replaced, with, the, mtv, logo, but, he, refused, the, use, of, his, voice, and, likeness, he, sued, hallmark, cards, in, 1994, when, they, used, his, name, and, a, recording, of, the, one, small, step, quote, in, a, christmas, ornament, without, his, permission, the, lawsuit, was, settled, out, of, court, for, an, undisclosed, sum, which, armstrong, donated, to, purdue, for, many, years, he, wrote, letters, congratulating, new, eagle, scouts, on, their, accomplishment, but, decided, to, quit, the, practice, in, the, 1990s, because, he, felt, the, letters, should, be, written, by, people, who, knew, the, scout, in, 2003, he, received, 950, congratulation, requests, this, contributed, to, the, myth, of, his, reclusiveness, armstrong, used, to, autograph, everything, except, first, day, covers, around, 1993, he, found, out, his, signatures, were, being, sold, online, and, that, most, of, them, were, forgeries, and, stopped, giving, autographs, some, former, astronauts, including, glenn, and, apollo, 17, s, harrison, schmitt, sought, political, careers, after, leaving, nasa, armstrong, was, approached, by, groups, from, both, the, democratic, and,

him, the, opportunity, to, see, some, of, the, grandest, views, of, the, creator, in, the, early, 1980s, he, was, the, subject, of, a, hoax, claiming, that, he, converted, to, islam, after, hearing, the, call, to, prayer, while, walking, on, the, moon, indonesian, singer, suhaemi, wrote, a, song, called, gema, suara, adzan, di, bulan, the, resonant, sound, of, the, call, to, prayer, on, the, moon, which, described, armstrong, s, supposed, conversion, and, the, song, was, widely, discussed, by, jakarta, news, outlets, in, 1983, similar, hoax, stories, were, seen, in, egypt, and, malaysia, in, march, 1983, the, u, s, state, department, responded, by, issuing, a, message, to, embassies, and, consulates, in, muslim, countries, saying, that, armstrong, had, not, converted, to, islam, the, hoax, surfaced, occasionally, for, the, next, three, decades, part, of, the, confusion, arose, from, the, similarity, between, the, names, of, the, country, of, lebanon, which, has, a, majority, muslim, population, and, armstrong, s, longtime, residence, in, lebanon, ohio, in, 1972, armstrong, visited, the, scottish, town, of, langholm, the, traditional, seat, of, clan, armstrong, he, was,

she, was, cutting, down, a, cherry, tree, and, he, arrived, at, her, house, 35, minutes, later, to, help, they, were, married, in, ohio, on, june, 12, 1994, and, had, a, second, ceremony, at, san,

him, as, a, reluctant, american, hero, served, his, nation, proudly, as, a, navy, fighter, pilot, test, pilot, and, astronaut, while, we, mourn, the, loss, of, a, very, good, man, we, also, celebrate, his, remarkable, life, and, hope, that, it, serves, as, an, example, to, young, people, around, the, world, to, work, hard, to, make, their, dreams, come, true, to, be, willing, to, explore, and, push, the, limits, and, to, selflessly, serve, a, cause, greater, than, themselves, for, those, who, may, ask, what, they, can, do, to, honor, neil, we, have, a, simple, request, honor, his, example, of, service, accomplishment, and, modesty, and, the, next, time, you, walk, outside, on, a, clear, night, and, see, the, moon, smiling, down, at, you, think, of, neil, armstrong, and, give, him, a,

into, the, latch, of, his, harness, and, prevented, it, from, being, buckled, threatening, to, abort, the, mission, armstrong, then, called, on, conrad, to, solve, the, problem, which, he, did, and, the, mission, proceeded, that, happened, because, neil, armstrong, was, a, team, player, he, always, worked, on, behalf, of, the, team, congressman, bill, johnson, from, armstrong, s, home, state, of,
