claude, elwood, shannon, april, 30, 1916, february, 24, 2001, was, an, american, mathematician, electrical, engineer, computer, scientist, and, cryptographer, known, as, the, father, of, information, theory, and, as, the, father, of, the, information, age, shannon, was, the, first, to, describe, the, boolean, gates, electronic, circuits, that, are, essential, to, all, digital, electronic, circuits, and, was, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, artificial, intelligence, he, is, credited, alongside, george, boole, for, laying, the, foundations, of, the, information, age, at, the, university, of, michigan, shannon, dual, degreed, graduating, with, a, bachelor, of, science, in, both, electrical, engineering, and, mathematics, in, 1936, a, 21, year, old, master, s, degree, student, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, in, electrical, engineering, his, thesis, concerned, switching, circuit, theory, demonstrating, that, electrical, applications, of, boolean, algebra, could, construct, any, logical, numerical, relationship, thereby, establishing, the, theory, behind, digital, computing, and, digital, circuits, the, thesis, has, been, claimed, to, be, the, most, important, master, s, thesis, of, all, time, as, in, 1985, howard, gardner, described, it, as, possibly, the, most, important, and, also, the, most, famous, master, s, thesis, of, the, century, while, herman, goldstine, described, it, as, surely, one, of, the, most, important, master, s, theses, ever, written, it, helped, to, change, digital, circuit, design, from, an, art, to, a, science, it, has, also, been, called, the, birth, certificate, of, the, digital, revolution, and, it, won, the, 1939, alfred, noble, prize, shannon, then, graduated, with, a, phd, in, mathematics, from, mit, in, 1940, with, his, thesis, focused, on, genetics, with, it, deriving, important, results, but, it, went, unpublished, shannon, contributed, to, the, field, of, cryptanalysis, for, national, defense, of, the, united, states, during, world, war, ii, including, his, fundamental, work, on, codebreaking, and, secure, telecommunications, writing, a, paper, which, is, considered, one, of, the, foundational, pieces, of, modern, cryptography, with, his, work, described, as, a, turning, point, and, marked, the, closure, of, classical, cryptography, and, the, beginning, of, modern, cryptography, the, work, of, shannon, is, the, foundation, of, secret, key, cryptography, including, the, work, of, horst, feistel, the, data, encryption, standard, des, advanced, encryption, standard, aes, and, more, as, a, result, shannon, has, been, called, the, founding, father, of, modern, cryptography, his, mathematical, theory, of, communication, laid, the, foundations, for, the, field, of, information, theory, with, his, famous, paper, being, called, the, magna, carta, of, the, information, age, by, scientific, american, along, with, his, work, being, described, as, being, at, the, heart, of, today, s, digital, information, technology, robert, g, gallager, referred, to, the, paper, as, a, blueprint, for, the, digital, era, regarding, the, influence, that, shannon, had, on, the, digital, age, solomon, w, golomb, remarked, it, s, like, saying, how, much, influence, the, inventor, of, the, alphabet, has, had, on, literature, shannon, s, theory, is, widely, used, and, has, been, fundamental, to, the, success, of, many, scientific, endeavors, such, as, the, invention, of, the, compact, disc, the, development, of, the, internet, feasibility, of, mobile, phones, the, understanding, of, black, holes, and, more, and, is, at, the, intersection, of, numerous, important, fields, shannon, made, numerous, contributions, to, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, writing, papers, on, programming, a, computer, for, chess, which, have, been, immensely, influential, and, also, his, theseus, machine, was, the, first, electrical, device, to, learn, by, trial, and, error, being, one, of, the, first, examples, of, artificial, intelligence, he, also, co, organized, and, participated, in, the, dartmouth, workshop, of, 1956, considered, the, founding, event, of, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, he, also, made, contributions, to, multiple, other, fields, such, as, detection, theory, and, combinatorics, rodney, brooks, declared, that, shannon, was, the, 20th, century, engineer, who, contributed, the, most, to, 21st, century, technologies, shannon, s, achievements, are, considered, to, be, on, par, in, his, field, with, those, of, albert, einstein, and, sir, isaac, newton, in, theirs, the, shannon, family, lived, in, gaylord, michigan, and, claude, was, born, in, a, hospital, in, nearby, petoskey, his, father, claude, sr, 1862, 1934, was, a, businessman, and, for, a, while, a, judge, of, probate, in, gaylord, his, mother, mabel, wolf, shannon, 1880, 1945, was, a, language, teacher, who, also, served, as, the, principal, of, gaylord, high, school, claude, sr, was, a, descendant, of, new, jersey, settlers, while, mabel, was, a, child, of, german, immigrants, shannon, s, family, was, active, in, their, methodist, church, during, his, youth, most, of, the, first, 16, years, of, shannon, s, life, were, spent, in, gaylord, where, he, attended, public, school, graduating, from, gaylord, high, school, in, 1932, shannon, showed, an, inclination, towards, mechanical, and, electrical, things, his, best, subjects, were, science, and, mathematics, at, home, he, constructed, such, devices, as, models, of, planes, a, radio, controlled, model, boat, and, a, barbed, wire, telegraph, system, to, a, friend, s, house, a, half, mile, away, while, growing, up, he, also, worked, as, a, messenger, for, the, western, union, company, shannon, s, childhood, hero, was, thomas, edison, whom, he, later, learned, was, a, distant, cousin, both, shannon, and, edison, were, descendants, of, john, ogden, 1609, 1682, a, colonial, leader, and, an, ancestor, of, many, distinguished, people, in, 1932, shannon, entered, the, university, of, michigan, where, he, was, introduced, to, the, work, of, george, boole, he, graduated, in, 1936, with, two, bachelor, s, degrees, one, in, electrical, engineering, and, the, other, in, mathematics, in, 1936, shannon, began, his, graduate, studies, in, electrical, engineering, at, the, massachusetts, institute, of, technology, mit, where, he, worked, on, vannevar, bush, s, differential, analyzer, which, was, an, early, analog, computer, that, was, composed, of, electromechanical, parts, and, could, solve, differential, equations, while, studying, the, complicated, ad, hoc, circuits, of, this, analyzer, shannon, designed, switching, circuits, based, on, boole, s, concepts, in, 1937, he, wrote, his, master, s, degree, thesis, a, symbolic, analysis, of, relay, and, switching, circuits, with, a, paper, from, this, thesis, published, in, 1938, a, revolutionary, work, for, switching, circuit, theory, shannon, diagramed, switching, circuits, that, could, implement, the, essential, operators, of, boolean, algebra, then, he, proved, that, his, switching, circuits, could, be, used, to, simplify, the, arrangement, of, the, electromechanical, relays, that, were, used, during, that, time, in, telephone, call, routing, switches, next, he, expanded, this, concept, proving, that, these, circuits, could, solve, all, problems, that, boolean, algebra, could, solve, in, the, last, chapter, he, presented, diagrams, of, several, circuits, including, a, digital, 4, bit, full, adder, using, electrical, switches, to, implement, logic, is, the, fundamental, concept, that, underlies, all, electronic, digital, computers, shannon, s, work, became, the, foundation, of, digital, circuit, design, as, it, became, widely, known, in, the, electrical, engineering, community, during, and, after, world, war, ii, the, theoretical, rigor, of, shannon, s, work, superseded, the, ad, hoc, methods, that, had, prevailed, previously, howard, gardner, hailed, shannon, s, thesis, possibly, the, most, important, and, also, the, most, noted, master, s, thesis, of, the, century, one, of, the, reviewers, of, his, work, commented, that, to, the, best, of, my, knowledge, this, is, the, first, application, of, the, methods, of, symbolic, logic, to, so, practical, an, engineering, problem, from, the, point, of, view, of, originality, i, rate, the, paper, as, outstanding, shannon, s, master, thesis, won, the, 1939, alfred, noble, prize, shannon, received, his, phd, in, mathematics, from, mit, in, 1940, vannevar, bush, had, suggested, that, shannon, should, work, on, his, dissertation, at, the, cold, spring, harbor, laboratory, in, order, to, develop, a, mathematical, formulation, for, mendelian, genetics, this, research, resulted, in, shannon, s, phd, thesis, called, an, algebra, for, theoretical, genetics, however, the, thesis, went, unpublished, after, shannon, lost, interest, but, it, did, contain, important, results, notably, he, was, one, of, the, first, to, apply, an, algebraic, framework, to, study, theoretical, population, genetics, in, addition, shannon, devised, a, general, expression, for, the, distribution, of, several, linked, traits, in, a, population, after, multiple, generations, under, a, random, mating, system, which, was, original, at, the, time, with, the, new, theorem, unworked, out, by, other, population, geneticists, of, the, time, in, 1940, shannon, became, a, national, research, fellow, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, in, princeton, shannon, had, the, opportunity, to, discuss, his, ideas, with, influential, scientists, and, mathematicians, such, as, hermann, weyl, and, john, von, neumann, and, he, also, had, occasional, encounters, with, albert, einstein, and, kurt, g, del, shannon, worked, freely, across, disciplines, and, this, ability, may, have, contributed, to, his, later, development, of, mathematical, information, theory, shannon, had, worked, at, bell, labs, for, a, few, months, in, the, summer, of, 1937, and, returned, there, to, work, on, fire, control, systems, and, cryptography, during, world, war, ii, under, a, contract, with, section, d, 2, control, systems, section, of, the, national, defense, research, committee, ndrc, shannon, is, credited, with, the, invention, of, signal, flow, graphs, in, 1942, he, discovered, the, topological, gain, formula, while, investigating, the, functional, operation, of, an, analog, computer, for, two, months, early, in, 1943, shannon, came, into, contact, with, the, leading, british, mathematician, alan, turing, turing, had, been, posted, to, washington, to, share, with, the, u, s, navy, s, cryptanalytic, service, the, methods, used, by, the, british, government, code, and, cypher, school, at, bletchley, park, to, break, the, cyphers, used, by, the, kriegsmarine, u, boats, in, the, north, atlantic, ocean, he, was, also, interested, in, the, encipherment, of, speech, and, to, this, end, spent, time, at, bell, labs, shannon, and, turing, met, at, teatime, in, the, cafeteria, turing, showed, shannon, his, 1936, paper, that, defined, what, is, now, known, as, the, universal, turing, machine, this, impressed, shannon, as, many, of, its, ideas, complemented, his, own, in, 1945, as, the, war, was, coming, to, an, end, the, ndrc, was, issuing, a, summary, of, technical, reports, as, a, last, step, prior, to, its, eventual, closing, down, inside, the, volume, on, fire, control, a, special, essay, titled, data, smoothing, and, prediction, in, fire, control, systems, coauthored, by, shannon, ralph, beebe, blackman, and, hendrik, wade, bode, formally, treated, the, problem, of, smoothing, the, data, in, fire, control, by, analogy, with, the, problem, of, separating, a, signal, from, interfering, noise, in, communications, systems, in, other, words, it, modeled, the, problem, in, terms, of, data, and, signal, processing, and, thus, heralded, the, coming, of, the, information, age, shannon, s, work, on, cryptography, was, even, more, closely, related, to, his, later, publications, on, communication, theory, at, the, close, of, the, war, he, prepared, a, classified, memorandum, for, bell, telephone, labs, entitled, a, mathematical, theory, of, cryptography, dated, september, 1945, a, declassified, version, of, this, paper, was, published, in, 1949, as, communication, theory, of, secrecy, systems, in, the, bell, system, technical, journal, this, paper, incorporated, many, of, the, concepts, and, mathematical, formulations, that, also, appeared, in, his, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, shannon, said, that, his, wartime, insights, into, communication, theory, and, cryptography, developed, simultaneously, and, that, they, were, so, close, together, you, couldn, t, separate, them, in, a, footnote, near, the, beginning, of, the, classified, report, shannon, announced, his, intention, to, develop, these, results, in, a, forthcoming, memorandum, on, the, transmission, of, information, while, he, was, at, bell, labs, shannon, proved, that, the, cryptographic, one, time, pad, is, unbreakable, in, his, classified, research, that, was, later, published, in, 1949, the, same, article, also, proved, that, any, unbreakable, system, must, have, essentially, the, same, characteristics, as, the, one, time, pad, the, key, must, be, truly, random, as, large, as, the, plaintext, never, reused, in, whole, or, part, and, kept, secret, in, 1948, the, promised, memorandum, appeared, as, a, mathematical, theory, of, communication, an, article, in, two, parts, in, the, july, and, october, issues, of, the, bell, system, technical, journal, this, work, focuses, on, the, problem, of, how, best, to, encode, the, message, a, sender, wants, to, transmit, shannon, developed, information, entropy, as, a, measure, of, the, information, content, in, a, message, which, is, a, measure, of, uncertainty, reduced, by, the, message, in, so, doing, he, essentially, invented, the, field, of, information, theory, the, book, the, mathematical, theory, of, communication, reprints, shannon, s, 1948, article, and, warren, weaver, s, popularization, of, it, which, is, accessible, to, the, non, specialist, weaver, pointed, out, that, the, word, information, in, communication, theory, is, not, related, to, what, you, do, say, but, to, what, you, could, say, that, is, information, is, a, measure, of, one, s, freedom, of, choice, when, one, selects, a, message, shannon, s, concepts, were, also, popularized, subject, to, his, own, proofreading, in, john, robinson, pierce, s, symbols, signals, and, noise, information, theory, s, fundamental, contribution, to, natural, language, processing, and, computational, linguistics, was, further, established, in, 1951, in, his, article, prediction, and, entropy, of, printed, english, showing, upper, and, lower, bounds, of, entropy, on, the, statistics, of, english, giving, a, statistical, foundation, to, language, analysis, in, addition, he, proved, that, treating, space, as, the, 27th, letter, of, the, alphabet, actually, lowers, uncertainty, in, written, language, providing, a, clear, quantifiable, link, between, cultural, practice, and, probabilistic, cognition, another, notable, paper, published, in, 1949, is, communication, theory, of, secrecy, systems, a, declassified, version, of, his, wartime, work, on, the, mathematical, theory, of, cryptography, in, which, he, proved, that, all, theoretically, unbreakable, cyphers, must, have, the, same, requirements, as, the, one, time, pad, he, is, credited, with, the, introduction, of, sampling, theorem, which, he, had, derived, as, early, as, 1940, and, which, is, concerned, with, representing, a, continuous, time, signal, from, a, uniform, discrete, set, of, samples, this, theory, was, essential, in, enabling, telecommunications, to, move, from, analog, to, digital, transmissions, systems, in, the, 1960s, and, later, in, 1950, shannon, designed, and, built, with, the, help, of, his, wife, a, learning, machine, named, theseus, it, consisted, of, a, maze, on, a, surface, through, which, a, mechanical, mouse, could, move, through, below, the, surface, were, sensors, that, followed, the, path, of, a, mechanical, mouse, through, the, maze, after, much, trial, and, error, this, device, would, learn, the, shortest, path, through, the, maze, and, direct, the, mechanical, mouse, through, the, maze, the, pattern, of, the, maze, could, be, changed, at, will, mazin, gilbert, stated, that, theseus, inspired, the, whole, field, of, ai, this, random, trial, and, error, is, the, foundation, of, artificial, intelligence, shannon, wrote, multiple, influential, papers, on, artificial, intelligence, such, as, his, 1950, paper, titled, programming, a, computer, for, playing, chess, and, his, 1953, paper, titled, computers, and, automata, shannon, co, organized, and, participated, in, the, dartmouth, workshop, of, 1956, alongside, john, mccarthy, marvin, minsky, and, nathaniel, rochester, and, which, is, considered, the, founding, event, of, the, field, of, artificial, intelligence, in, 1956, shannon, joined, the, mit, faculty, holding, an, endowed, chair, he, worked, in, the, research, laboratory, of, electronics, rle, he, continued, to, serve, on, the, mit, faculty, until, 1978, shannon, developed, alzheimer, s, disease, and, spent, the, last, few, years, of, his, life, in, a, nursing, home, he, died, in, 2001, survived, by, his, wife, a, son, and, daughter, and, two, granddaughters, outside, of, shannon, s, academic, pursuits, he, was, interested, in, juggling, unicycling, and, chess, he, also, invented, many, devices, including, a, roman, numeral, computer, called, throbac, and, juggling, machines, he, built, a, device, that, could, solve, the, rubik, s, cube, puzzle, shannon, designed, the, minivac, 601, a, digital, computer, trainer, to, teach, business, people, about, how, computers, functioned, it, was, sold, by, the, scientific, development, corp, starting, in, 1961, he, is, also, considered, the, co, inventor, of, the, first, wearable, computer, along, with, edward, o, thorp, the, device, was, used, to, improve, the, odds, when, playing, roulette, shannon, married, norma, levor, a, wealthy, jewish, left, wing, intellectual, in, january, 1940, the, marriage, ended, in, divorce, after, about, a, year, levor, later, married, ben, barzman, shannon, met, his, second, wife, mary, elizabeth, moore, betty, when, she, was, a, numerical, analyst, at, bell, labs, they, were, married, in, 1949, betty, assisted, claude, in, building, some, of, his, most, famous, inventions, they, had, three, children, shannon, presented, himself, as, apolitical, and, an, atheist, there, are, six, statues, of, shannon, sculpted, by, eugene, daub, one, at, the, university, of, michigan, one, at, mit, in, the, laboratory, for, information, and, decision, systems, one, in, gaylord, michigan, one, at, the, university, of, california, san, diego, one, at, bell, labs, and, another, at, at, t, shannon, labs, the, statue, in, gaylord, is, located, in, the, claude, shannon, memorial, park, after, the, breakup, of, the, bell, system, the, part, of, bell, labs, that, remained, with, at, t, corporation, was, named, shannon, labs, in, his, honor, according, to, neil, sloane, an, at, t, fellow, who, co, edited, shannon, s, large, collection, of, papers, in, 1993, the, perspective, introduced, by, shannon, s, communication, theory, now, called, information, theory, is, the, foundation, of, the, digital, revolution, and, every, device, containing, a, microprocessor, or, microcontroller, is, a, conceptual, descendant, of, shannon, s, publication, in, 1948, he, s, one, of, the, great, men, of, the, century, without, him, none, of, the, things, we, know, today, would, exist, the, whole, digital, revolution, started, with, him, the, cryptocurrency, unit, shannon, a, synonym, for, gwei, is, named, after, him, shannon, is, credited, by, many, as, single, handedly, creating, information, theory, and, for, laying, the, foundations, for, the, digital, age, a, mind, at, play, a, biography, of, shannon, written, by, jimmy, soni, and, rob, goodman, was, published, in, 2017, they, described, shannon, as, the, most, important, genius, you, ve, never, heard, of, a, man, whose, intellect, was, on, par, with, albert, einstein, and, isaac, newton, on, april, 30, 2016, shannon, was, honored, with, a, google, doodle, to, celebrate, his, life, on, what, would, have, been, his, 100th, birthday, the, bit, player, a, feature, film, about, shannon, directed, by, mark, levinson, premiered, at, the, world, science, festival, in, 2019, drawn, from, interviews, conducted, with, shannon, in, his, house, in, the, 1980s, the, film, was, released, on, amazon, prime, in, august, 2020, shannon, s, the, mathematical, theory, of, communication, begins, with, an, interpretation, of, his, own, work, by, warren, weaver, although, shannon, s, entire, work, is, about, communication, itself, warren, weaver, communicated, his, ideas, in, such, a, way, that, those, not, acclimated, to, complex, theory, and, mathematics, could, comprehend, the, fundamental, laws, he, put, forth, the, coupling, of, their, unique, communicational, abilities, and, ideas, generated, the, shannon, weaver, model, although, the, mathematical, and, theoretical, underpinnings, emanate, entirely, from, shannon, s, work, after, weaver, s, introduction, for, the, layman, weaver, s, introduction, better, communicates, the, mathematical, theory, of, communication, but, shannon, s, subsequent, logic, mathematics, and, expressive, precision, was, responsible, for, defining, the, problem, itself, theseus, created, in, 1950, was, a, mechanical, mouse, controlled, by, an, electromechanical, relay, circuit, that, enabled, it, to, move, around, a, labyrinth, of, 25, squares, the, maze, configuration, was, flexible, and, it, could, be, modified, arbitrarily, by, rearranging, movable, partitions, the, mouse, was, designed, to, search, through, the, corridors, until, it, found, the, target, having, travelled, through, the, maze, the, mouse, could, then, be, placed, anywhere, it, had, been, before, and, because, of, its, prior, experience, it, could, go, directly, to, the, target, if, placed, in, unfamiliar, territory, it, was, programmed, to, search, until, it, reached, a, known, location, and, then, it, would, proceed, to, the, target, adding, the, new, knowledge, to, its, memory, and, learning, new, behavior, shannon, s, mouse, appears, to, have, been, the, first, artificial, learning, device, of, its, kind, in, 1949, shannon, completed, a, paper, published, in, march, 1950, which, estimates, the, game, tree, complexity, of, chess, which, is, approximately, 10, 120, this, number, is, now, often, referred, to, as, the, shannon, number, and, is, still, regarded, today, as, an, accurate, estimate, of, the, game, s, complexity, the, number, is, often, cited, as, one, of, the, barriers, to, solving, the, game, of, chess, using, an, exhaustive, analysis, i, e, brute, force, analysis, on, march, 9, 1949, shannon, presented, a, paper, called, programming, a, computer, for, playing, chess, the, paper, was, presented, at, the, national, institute, for, radio, engineers, convention, in, new, york, he, described, how, to, program, a, computer, to, play, chess, based, on, position, scoring, and, move, selection, he, proposed, basic, strategies, for, restricting, the, number, of, possibilities, to, be, considered, in, a, game, of, chess, in, march, 1950, it, was, published, in, philosophical, magazine, and, is, considered, one, of, the, first, articles, published, on, the, topic, of, programming, a, computer, for, playing, chess, and, using, a, computer, to, solve, the, game, in, 1950, shannon, wrote, an, article, titled, a, chess, playing, machine, which, was, published, in, scientific, american, both, papers, have, had, immense, influence, and, laid, the, foundations, for, future, chess, programs, his, process, for, having, the, computer, decide, on, which, move, to, make, was, a, minimax, procedure, based, on, an, evaluation, function, of, a, given, chess, position, shannon, gave, a, rough, example, of, an, evaluation, function, in, which, the, value, of, the, black, position, was, subtracted, from, that, of, the, white, position, material, was, counted, according, to, the, usual, chess, piece, relative, value, 1, point, for, a, pawn, 3, points, for, a, knight, or, bishop, 5, points, for, a, rook, and, 9, points, for, a, queen, he, considered, some, positional, factors, subtracting, point, for, each, doubled, pawn, backward, pawn, and, isolated, pawn, mobility, was, incorporated, by, adding, 0, 1, point, for, each, legal, move, available, shannon, formulated, a, version, of, kerckhoffs, principle, as, the, enemy, knows, the, system, in, this, form, it, is, known, as, shannon, s, maxim, the, shannon, centenary, 2016, marked, the, life, and, influence, of, claude, elwood, shannon, on, the, hundredth, anniversary, of, his, birth, on, april, 30, 1916, it, was, inspired, in, part, by, the, alan, turing, year, an, ad, hoc, committee, of, the, ieee, information, theory, society, including, christina, fragouli, r, diger, urbanke, michelle, effros, lav, varshney, and, sergio, verd, coordinated, worldwide, events, the, initiative, was, announced, in, the, history, panel, at, the, 2015, ieee, information, theory, workshop, jerusalem, and, the, ieee, information, theory, society, newsletter, a, detailed, listing, of, confirmed, events, was, available, on, the, website, of, the, ieee, information, theory, society, some, of, the, activities, included, the, claude, e, shannon, award, was, established, in, his, honor, he, was, also, its, first, recipient, in, 1973
