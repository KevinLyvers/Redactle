and, later, again, during, khosrow, i, s, reign, this, second, conflict, was, partially, initiated, due, to, his, ambitions, in, the, west, justinian, is, regarded, as, one, of, the, most, prominent, and, influential, roman, emperors, and, historians, have, often, characterized, him, as, a, workaholic, who, worked, tirelessly, to, expand, the, byzantine, empire, one, of, the, most, enduring, aspects, of, his, legacy, was, the, uniform, rewriting, of, roman, law, the, corpus, juris, civilis, which, was, first, applied, throughout, continental, europe, and, is, still, the, basis, of, civil, law, in, many, modern, states, his, reign, also, marked, a, blossoming, of, eastern, roman, byzantine, culture, and, his, building, program, yielded, works, such, as, the, hagia, sophia, justinian, was, born, in, tauresium, dardania, probably, in, 482, a, native, speaker, of, latin, possibly, the, last, roman, emperor, to, be, one, he, came, from, a, peasant, family, thought, to, have, been, of, either, of, illyro, roman, or, thraco, roman, origin, the, name, iustinianus, which, he, took, later, is, indicative, of, adoption, by, his, uncle, justin, during, his, reign, he, founded, justiniana, prima, not, far, from, his, birthplace, his, mother, was, vigilantia, the, sister, of, justin, justin, who, was, commander, of, one, of, the, imperial, guard, units, the, excubitors, before, he,

lived, during, the, reign, of, justinian, describes, his, appearance, as, short, fair, skinned, curly, haired, round, faced, and, handsome, another, contemporary, historian, procopius, compares, justinian, s, appearance, to, that, of, tyrannical, emperor, domitian, although, this, is, probably, slander, when, emperor, anastasius, died, in, 518, justin, was, proclaimed, the, new, emperor, with, significant, help, from, justinian, justinian, showed, a, lot, of, ambition, and, several, sources, claim, that, he, was, functioning, as, virtual, regent, long, before, justin, made, him, associate, emperor, although, there, is, no, conclusive, evidence, of, this, as, justin, became, senile, near, the, end, of, his, reign, justinian, became, the, de, facto, ruler, following, the, general, vitalian, s, assassination, in, 520, orchestrated, by, justinian, and, justin, justinian, was, appointed, consul, and, commander, of, the, army, of, the, east, justinian, remained, justin, s,

death, on, 1, august, 527, as, a, ruler, justinian, showed, great, energy, he, was, known, as, the, emperor, who, never, sleeps, for, his, work, habits, nevertheless, he, seems, to, have, been, amiable, and, easy, to, approach, around, 525, he, married, his, mistress, theodora, in, constantinople, she, was, by, profession, an, actress, and, some, twenty, years, his, junior, in, earlier, times, justinian, could, not, have, married, her, owing, to, her, class, but, his, uncle, emperor, justin, i, had, passed, a, law, lifting, restrictions, on, marriages, with, ex, actresses, though, the, marriage, caused, a, scandal, theodora, would, become, very, influential, in, the, politics, of, the, empire, other, talented, individuals, included, tribonian, his, legal, adviser, peter, the, patrician, the, diplomat, and, long, time, head, of, the, palace, bureaucracy, justinian, s, finance, ministers, john, the, cappadocian, and, peter, barsymes, who, managed, to, collect, taxes, more, efficiently, than, any, before, thereby, funding, justinian, s, wars, and, finally, his, prodigiously, talented, generals, belisarius, and, narses, justinian, s, rule, was, not, universally, popular, early, in, his, reign, he, nearly, lost, his, throne, during, the, nika, riots, and, a, conspiracy, against, the, emperor, s, life, by, dissatisfied, entrepreneurs, was, discovered, as, late, as, 562, justinian, was, struck, by, the, plague, in, the, early, 540s, but, recovered, theodora, died, in, 548, at, a, relatively, young, age, possibly, of, cancer, justinian, outlived, her, by, nearly, twenty, years, justinian, who, had, always, had, a, keen, interest, in, theological, matters, and, actively, participated, in, debates, on, christian, doctrine, became, even, more, devoted, to, religion, during, the, later, years, of, his, life, he, died, on, 14, november, 565, childless, he, was, succeeded, by, justin, ii, who, was, the, son, of, his, sister, vigilantia, and, married, to,

pillage, of, the, city, in, 1204, by, the, latin, states, of, the, fourth, crusade, justinian, achieved, lasting, fame, through, his, judicial, reforms, particularly, through, the, complete, revision, of, all, roman, law, something, that, had, not, previously, been, attempted, the, total, of, justinian, s, legislation, is, known, today, as, the, corpus, juris, civilis, it, consists, of, the, codex, justinianeus, the, digesta, or, pandectae, the, institutiones, and, the, novellae, early, in, his, reign, justinian, had, appointed, the, quaestor, tribonian, to, oversee, this, task, the, first,

followed, by, the, digesta, or, pandectae, a, compilation, of, older, legal, texts, in, 533, and, by, the, institutiones, a, textbook, explaining, the, principles, of, law, the, novellae, a, collection, of, new, laws, issued, during, justinian, s, reign, supplements, the, corpus, as, opposed, to, the, rest, of, the, corpus, the, novellae, appeared, in, greek, the, common, language, of, the, eastern, empire, the, corpus, forms, the, basis, of, latin, jurisprudence, including, ecclesiastical, canon, law, and, for, historians, provides, a, valuable, insight, into, the, concerns, and, activities, of, the, later, roman, empire, as, a, collection, it, gathers, together, the, many, sources, in, which, the, leges, laws, and, the, other, rules, were, expressed, or, published, proper, laws, senatorial, consults, senatusconsulta, imperial, decrees, case, law, and, jurists, opinions, and, interpretations, responsa, prudentium, tribonian, s, code, ensured, the, survival, of, roman, law, it, formed, the, basis, of, later, byzantine, law, as, expressed, in, the, basilika, of, basil, i, and, leo, vi, the, wise, the, only, western, province, where, the, justinianic, code, was, introduced, was, italy, after, the, conquest, by, the, so, called, pragmatic, sanction, of, 554, from, where, it, was, to, pass, to, western, europe, in, the, 12th, century, and, become, the, basis, of, much, continental, european, law, code, which, was, eventually, spread, by, european, empires, to, the, americas, and, beyond, in, the, age, of, discovery, it, eventually, passed, to, eastern, europe, where, it, appeared, in, slavic, editions, and, it, also, passed, on, to, russia, it, remains, influential, to, this, day, he, passed, laws, to, protect, prostitutes, from, exploitation, and, women, from, being, forced, into, prostitution, rapists, were, treated, severely, further, by, his, policies, women, charged, with, major, crimes, should, be, guarded, by, other, women, to, prevent,

legislation, also, revealed, a, greater, concern, for, the, interests, of, children, this, was, particularly, so, with, respect, to, children, born, out, of, wedlock, the, law, under, justinian, also, reveals, a, striking, interest, in, child, neglect, issues, justinian, protected, the, rights, of, children, whose, parents, remarried, and, produced, more, offspring, or, who, simply, separated, and, abandoned, their, offspring, forcing, them, to, beg, justinian, discontinued, the, regular, appointment, of, consuls, in, 541, in, constantinople, under, justinian, hospitals, were, built, and, free, medical, care, provided, to, the, many, poor, residents, of, the, city, in, addition, public, baths, were, free, for, all, residents, and, 20, state, bakeries, provided, free, bread, to, those, who, needed, it, according, to, one, study, the, empire, s, social, welfare, programs, ensured, that, no, one, went, hungry, justinian, s, habit, of, choosing, efficient, but, unpopular, advisers, nearly, cost, him, his, throne, early, in, his, reign, in, january, 532, partisans, of, the, chariot, racing, factions, in, constantinople, normally, rivals, united, against, justinian, in, a, revolt, that, has, become, known, as, the, nika, riots, they, forced, him, to, dismiss, tribonian, and, two, of, his, other, ministers, and, then, attempted, to, overthrow, justinian, himself, and, replace, him, with, the, senator, hypatius, who, was, a, nephew, of, the, late, emperor, anastasius, while, the, crowd, was, rioting, in, the, streets, justinian, considered, fleeing, the, capital, by, sea, but, eventually, decided, to, stay, apparently, on, the, prompting, of, his, wife, theodora, who, refused, to, leave, in, the, next, two, days, he, ordered, the, brutal, suppression, of, the, riots, by, his, generals, belisarius, and, mundus, procopius, relates, that, 30, 000, unarmed, civilians, were, killed, in, the, hippodrome, on, theodora, s, insistence, and, apparently, against, his, own, judgment, justinian, had, anastasius, nephews, executed, the, destruction, that, took, place, during, the, revolt, provided, justinian, with, an, opportunity, to, tie, his, name, to, a, series, of, splendid, new, buildings, most, notably, the, architectural, innovation, of, the, domed, hagia, sophia, one, of, the, most, spectacular, features, of, justinian, s, reign, was, the, recovery, of, large, stretches, of, land, around, the, western, mediterranean, basin, that, had, slipped, out, of, imperial, control, in, the, 5th, century, as, a, christian, roman, emperor, justinian, considered, it, his, divine, duty, to, restore, the, roman, empire, to, its, ancient, boundaries, although, he, never, personally, took, part, in, military, campaigns, he, boasted, of, his, successes, in, the, prefaces, to, his, laws, and, had, them, commemorated, in, art, the, re, conquests, were, in, large, part, carried, out, by, his, general, belisarius, from, his, uncle, justinian, inherited, ongoing, hostilities, with, the, sassanid, empire, in, 530, the, persian, forces, suffered, a, double, defeat, at, dara, and, satala, but, the, next, year, saw, the, defeat, of, roman, forces, under, belisarius, near, callinicum, justinian, then, tried, to, make, alliance, with, the, axumites, of, ethiopia, and, the, himyarites, of, yemen, against, the, persians, but, this, failed, when, king, kavadh, i, of, persia, died, september, 531, justinian, concluded, an, eternal, peace, which, cost, him, 11, 000, pounds, of, gold, with, his, successor, khosrau, i, 532, having, thus, secured, his, eastern, frontier, justinian, turned, his, attention, to, the, west, where, germanic, kingdoms, had, been, established, in, the, territories, of, the, former, western, roman, empire, the, first, of, the, western, kingdoms, justinian, attacked, was, that, of, the, vandals, in, north, africa, king, hilderic, who, had, maintained, good, relations, with, justinian, and, the, north, african, catholic, clergy, had, been, overthrown, by, his, cousin, gelimer, in, 530, ad, imprisoned, the, deposed, king, appealed, to, justinian, justinian, protested, gelimer, s, actions, demanding, that, gelimer, return, the, kingdom, to, hilderic, gelimer, replied, in, effect, that, justinian, had, no, authority, to, make, these, demands, angered, at, this, response, justinian, quickly, concluded, his, ongoing, war, with, the, sassanian, empire, and, prepared, an, expedition, against, the, vandals, in, 533, in, 533, belisarius, sailed, to, africa, with, a, fleet, of, 92, dromons, escorting, 500, transports, carrying, an, army, of, about, 15, 000, men, as, well, as, a, number, of, barbarian, troops, they, landed, at, caput, vada, modern, ras, kaboudia, in, modern, tunisia, they, defeated, the, vandals, who, were, caught, completely, off, guard, at, ad, decimum, on, 14, september, 533, and, tricamarum, in, december, belisarius, took, carthage, king, gelimer, fled, to, mount, pappua, in, numidia, but, surrendered, the, next, spring, he, was, taken, to, constantinople, where, he, was, paraded, in, a, triumph, sardinia, and, corsica, the, balearic, islands, and, the, stronghold, septem, fratres, near, mons, calpe, later, named, gibraltar, were, recovered, in, the, same, campaign, in, this, war, the, contemporary, procopius, remarks, that, africa, was, so, entirely, depopulated, that, a, person, might, travel, several, days, without, meeting, a, human, being, and, he, adds, it, is, no, exaggeration, to, say, that, in, the, course, of, the, war, 5, 000, 000, perished, by, the, sword, and, famine, and, pestilence, an, african, prefecture, centered, in, carthage, was, established, in, april, 534, but, it, would, teeter, on, the, brink, of, collapse, during, the, next, 15, years, amidst, warfare, with, the, moors, and, military, mutinies, the, area, was, not, completely, pacified, until, 548, but, remained, peaceful, thereafter, and, enjoyed, a, measure, of, prosperity, the, recovery, of, africa, cost, the, empire, about, 100, 000, pounds, of, gold, as, in, africa, dynastic, struggles, in, ostrogothic, italy, provided, an, opportunity, for, intervention, the, young, king, athalaric, had, died, on, 2, october, 534, and, a, usurper, theodahad, had, imprisoned, queen, amalasuintha, theodoric, s, daughter, and, mother, of, athalaric, on, the, island, of, martana, in, lake, bolsena, where, he, had, her, assassinated, in, 535, thereupon, belisarius, with, 7, 500, men, invaded, sicily, 535, and, advanced, into, italy, sacking, naples, and, capturing, rome, on, 9, december, 536, by, that, time, theodahad, had, been, deposed, by, the, ostrogothic, army, who, had, elected, vitigis, as, their, new, king, he, gathered, a, large, army, and, besieged, rome, from, february, 537, to, march, 538, without, being, able, to, retake, the, city, justinian, sent, another, general, narses, to, italy, but, tensions, between, narses, and, belisarius, hampered, the, progress, of, the, campaign, milan, was, taken, but, was, soon, recaptured, and, razed, by, the, ostrogoths, justinian, recalled, narses, in, 539, by, then, the, military, situation, had, turned, in, favour, of, the, romans, and, in, 540, belisarius, reached, the, ostrogothic, capital, ravenna, there, he, was, offered, the, title, of, western, roman, emperor, by, the, ostrogoths, at, the, same, time, that, envoys, of, justinian, were, arriving, to, negotiate, a, peace, that, would, leave, the, region, north, of, the, po, river, in, gothic, hands, belisarius, feigned, acceptance, of, the, offer, entered, the, city, in, may, 540, and, reclaimed, it, for, the, empire, then, having, been, recalled, by, justinian, belisarius, returned, to, constantinople, taking, the, captured, vitigis, and, his, wife, matasuntha, with, him, belisarius, had, been, recalled, in, the, face, of, renewed, hostilities, by, the, persians, following, a, revolt, against, the, empire, in, armenia, in, the, late, 530s, and, possibly, motivated, by, the, pleas, of, ostrogothic, ambassadors, king, khosrau, i, broke, the, eternal, peace, and, invaded, roman, territory, in, the, spring, of, 540, he, first, sacked, beroea, and, then, antioch, allowing, the, garrison, of, 6, 000, men, to, leave, the, city, besieged, daras, and, then, went, on, to, attack, the, byzantine, base, in, the, small, but, strategically, significant, satellite, kingdom, of, lazica, near, the, black, sea, as, requested, by, its, discontented, king, gubazes, exacting, tribute, from, the, towns, he, passed, along, his, way, he, forced, justinian, i, to, pay, him, 5, 000, pounds, of, gold, plus, 500, pounds, of, gold, more, each, year, belisarius, arrived, in, the, east, in, 541, but, after, some, success, was, again, recalled, to, constantinople, in, 542, the, reasons, for, his, withdrawal, are, not, known, but, it, may, have, been, instigated, by, rumours, of, his, disloyalty, reaching, the, court, the, outbreak, of, the, plague, coupled, with, a, rebellion, in, persia, brought, khosrow, i, s, offensives, to, a, halt, exploiting, this, justinian, ordered, all, the, forces, in, the, east, to, invade, persian, armenia, but, the, 30, 000, strong, byzantine, force, was, defeated, by, a, small, force, at, anglon, the, next, year, khosrau, unsuccessfully, besieged, the, major, city, of, edessa, both, parties, made, little, headway, and, in, 545, a, truce, was, agreed, upon, for, the, southern, part, of, the, roman, persian, frontier, after, that, the, lazic, war, in, the, north, continued, for, several, years, the, lazic, king, switched, to, the, byzantine, side, and, in, 549, justinian, sent, dagisthaeus, to, recapture, petra, but, he, faced, heavy, resistance, and, the, siege, was, relieved, by, sasanian, reinforcements, justinian, replaced, him, with, bessas, who, was, under, a, cloud, after, the, loss, of, rome, in, 546, but, he, managed, to, capture, and, dismantle, petra, in, 551, the, war, continued, for, several, years, until, a, second, truce, in, 557, followed, by, a, fifty, years, peace, in, 562, under, its, terms, the, persians, agreed, to, abandon, lazica, in, exchange, for, an, annual, tribute, of, 400, or, 500, pounds, of, gold, 30, 000, solidi, to, be, paid, by, the, romans, while, military, efforts, were, directed, to, the, east, the, situation, in, italy, took, a, turn, for, the, worse, under, their, respective, kings, ildibad, and, eraric, both, murdered, in, 541, and, especially, totila, the, ostrogoths, made, quick, gains, after, a, victory, at, faenza, in, 542, they, reconquered, the, major, cities, of, southern, italy, and, soon, held, almost, the, entire, italian, peninsula, belisarius, was, sent, back, to, italy, late, in, 544, but, lacked, sufficient, troops, and, supplies, making, no, headway, he, was, relieved, of, his, command, in, 548, belisarius, succeeded, in, defeating, a, gothic, fleet, of, 200, ships, during, this, period, the, city, of, rome, changed, hands, three, more, times, first, taken, and, depopulated, by, the, ostrogoths, in, december, 546, then, reconquered, by, the, byzantines, in, 547, and, then, again, by, the, goths, in, january, 550, totila, also, plundered, sicily, and, attacked, greek, coastlines, finally, justinian, dispatched, a, force, of, approximately, 35, 000, men, 2, 000, men, were, detached, and, sent, to, invade, southern, visigothic, hispania, under, the, command, of, narses, the, army, reached, ravenna, in, june, 552, and, defeated, the, ostrogoths, decisively, within, a, month, at, the, battle, of, busta, gallorum, in, the, apennines, where, totila, was, slain, after, a, second, battle, at, mons, lactarius, in, october, that, year, the, resistance, of, the, ostrogoths, was, finally, broken, in, 554, a, large, scale, frankish, invasion, was, defeated, at, casilinum, and, italy, was, secured, for, the, empire, though, it, would, take, narses, several, years, to, reduce, the, remaining, gothic, strongholds, at, the, end, of, the, war, italy, was, garrisoned, with, an, army, of, 16, 000, men, the, recovery, of, italy, cost, the, empire, about, 300, 000, pounds, of, gold, procopius, estimated, 15, 000, 000, goths, died, in, addition, to, the, other, conquests, the, empire, established, a, presence, in, visigothic, hispania, when, the, usurper, athanagild, requested, assistance, in, his, rebellion, against, king, agila, i, in, 552, justinian, dispatched, a, force, of, 2, 000, men, according, to, the, historian, jordanes, this, army, was, led, by, the, octogenarian, liberius, the, byzantines, took, cartagena, and, other, cities, on, the, southeastern, coast, and, founded, the, new, province, of, spania, before, being, checked, by, their, former, ally, athanagild, who, had, by, now, become, king, this, campaign, marked, the, apogee, of, byzantine, expansion, during, justinian, s, reign, the, balkans, suffered, from, several, incursions, by, the, turkic, and, slavic, peoples, who, lived, north, of, the, danube, here, justinian, resorted, mainly, to, a, combination, of, diplomacy, and, a, system, of, defensive, works, in, 559, a, particularly, dangerous, invasion, of, sklavinoi, and, kutrigurs, under, their, khan, zabergan, threatened, constantinople, but, they, were, repulsed, by, the, aged, general, belisarius, justinian, s, ambition, to, restore, the, roman, empire, to, its, former, glory, was, only, partly, realized, with, the, only, noteworthy, sustainable, conquests, in, africa, in, the, west, the, brilliant, early, military, successes, of, the, 530s, were, followed, by, years, of, stagnation, the, dragging, war, with, the, goths, was, a, disaster, for, italy, even, though, its, long, lasting, effects, may, have, been, less, severe, than, is, sometimes, thought, the, heavy, taxes, that, the, administration, imposed, upon, italian, population, were, deeply, resented, the, final, victory, in, italy, and, the, conquest, of, africa, and, the, coast, of, southern, hispania, significantly, enlarged, the, area, of, byzantine, influence, and, eliminated, all, naval, threats, to, the, empire, which, in, 555, reached, its, territorial, zenith, despite, losing, much, of, italy, soon, after, justinian, s, death, the, empire, retained, several, important, cities, including, rome, naples, and, ravenna, leaving, the, lombards, as, a, regional, threat, the, newly, founded, province, of, spania, kept, the, visigoths, as, a, threat, to, hispania, alone, and, not, to, the, western, mediterranean, and, africa, events, of, the, later, years, of, his, reign, showed, that, constantinople, itself, was, not, safe, from, barbarian, incursions, from, the, north, and, even, the, relatively, benevolent, historian, menander, protector, felt, the, need, to, attribute, the, emperor, s, failure, to, protect, the, capital, to, the, weakness, of, his, body, in, his, old, age, in, his, efforts, to, renew, the, roman, empire, justinian, dangerously, stretched, its, resources, while, failing, to, take, into, account, the, changed, realities, of, 6th, century, europe, justinian, saw, the, orthodoxy, of, his, empire, threatened, by, diverging, religious, currents, especially, monophysitism, which, had, many, adherents, in, the, eastern, provinces, of, syria, and, egypt, monophysite, doctrine, which, maintains, that, jesus, christ, had, one, divine, nature, rather, than, a, synthesis, of, divine, and, human, nature, had, been, condemned, as, a, heresy, by, the, council, of, chalcedon, in, 451, and, the, tolerant, policies, towards, monophysitism, of, zeno, and, anastasius, i, had, been, a, source, of, tension, in, the, relationship, with, the, bishops, of, rome, justin, reversed, this, trend, and, confirmed, the, chalcedonian, doctrine, openly, condemning, the, monophysites, justinian, who, continued, this, policy, tried, to, impose, religious, unity, on, his, subjects, by, forcing, them, to, accept, doctrinal, compromises, that, might, appeal, to, all, parties, a, policy, that, proved, unsuccessful, as, he, satisfied, none, of, them, near, the, end, of, his, life, justinian, became, ever, more, inclined, towards, the, monophysite, doctrine, especially, in, the, form, of, aphthartodocetism, but, he, died, before, being, able, to, issue, any, legislation, the, empress, theodora, sympathized, with, the, monophysites, and, is, said, to, have, been, a, constant, source, of, pro, monophysite, intrigues, at, the, court, in, constantinople, in, the, earlier, years, in, the, course, of, his, reign, justinian, who, had, a, genuine, interest, in, matters, of, theology, authored, a, small, number, of, theological, treatises, as, in, his, secular, administration, despotism, appeared, also, in, the, emperor, s, ecclesiastical, policy, he, regulated, everything, both, in, religion, and, in, law, at, the, very, beginning, of, his, reign, he, deemed, it, proper, to, promulgate, by, law, the, church, s, belief, in, the, trinity, and, the, incarnation, and, to, threaten, all, heretics, with, the, appropriate, penalties, whereas, he, subsequently, declared, that, he, intended, to, deprive, all, disturbers, of, orthodoxy, of, the, opportunity, for, such, offense, by, due, process, of, law, he, made, the, nicaeno, constantinopolitan, creed, the, sole, symbol, of, the, church, and, accorded, legal, force, to, the, canons, of, the, four, ecumenical, councils, the, bishops, in, attendance, at, the, council, of, constantinople, 536, recognized, that, nothing, could, be, done, in, the, church, contrary, to, the, emperor, s, will, and, command, while, on, his, side, the, emperor, in, the, case, of, the, patriarch, anthimus, reinforced, the, ban, of, the, church, with, temporal, proscription, justinian, protected, the, purity, of, the, church, by, suppressing, heretics, he, neglected, no, opportunity, to, secure, the, rights, of, the, church, and, clergy, and, to, protect, and, extend, monasticism, he, granted, the, monks, the, right, to, inherit, property, from, private, citizens, and, the, right, to, receive, solemnia, or, annual, gifts, from, the, imperial, treasury, or, from, the, taxes, of, certain, provinces, and, he, prohibited, lay, confiscation, of, monastic, estates, although, the, despotic, character, of, his, measures, is, contrary, to, modern, sensibilities, he, was, a, nursing, father, of, the, church, both, the, codex, and, the, novellae, contain, many, enactments, regarding, donations, foundations, and, the, administration, of, ecclesiastical, property, election, and, rights, of, bishops, priests, and, abbots, monastic, life, residential, obligations, of, the, clergy, conduct, of, divine, service, episcopal, jurisdiction, etc, justinian, also, rebuilt, the, church, of, hagia, sophia, which, cost, 20, 000, pounds, of, gold, the, original, site, having, been, destroyed, during, the, nika, riots, the, new, hagia, sophia, with, its, numerous, chapels, and, shrines, gilded, octagonal, dome, and, mosaics, became, the, centre, and, most, visible, monument, of, eastern, orthodoxy, in, constantinople, from, the, middle, of, the, 5th, century, onward, increasingly, arduous, tasks, confronted, the, emperors, of, the, east, in, ecclesiastical, matters, justinian, entered, the, arena, of, ecclesiastical, statecraft, shortly, after, his, uncle, s, accession, in, 518, and, put, an, end, to, the, acacian, schism, previous, emperors, had, tried, to, alleviate, theological, conflicts, by, declarations, that, deemphasized, the, council, of, chalcedon, which, had, condemned, monophysitism, which, had, strongholds, in, egypt, and, syria, and, by, tolerating, the, appointment, of, monophysites, to, church, offices, the, popes, reacted, by, severing, ties, with, the, patriarch, of, constantinople, who, supported, these, policies, emperors, justin, i, and, later, justinian, himself, rescinded, these, policies, and, reestablished, the, union, between, constantinople, and, rome, after, this, justinian, also, felt, entitled, to, settle, disputes, in, papal, elections, as, he, did, when, he, favored, vigilius, and, had, his, rival, silverius, deported, this, new, found, unity, between, east, and, west, did, not, however, solve, the, ongoing, disputes, in, the, east, justinian, s, policies, switched, between, attempts, to, force, monophysites, and, miaphysites, who, were, mistaken, to, be, adherers, of, monophysitism, to, accept, the, chalcedonian, creed, by, persecuting, their, bishops, and, monks, thereby, embittering, their, sympathizers, in, egypt, and, other, provinces, and, attempts, at, a, compromise, that, would, win, over, the, monophysites, without, surrendering, the, chalcedonian, faith, such, an, approach, was, supported, by, the, empress, theodora, who, favoured, the, miaphysites, unreservedly, in, the, condemnation, of, the, three, chapters, three, theologians, that, had, opposed, monophysitism, before, and, after, the, council, of, chalcedon, justinian, tried, to, win, over, the, opposition, at, the, fifth, ecumenical, council, most, of, the, eastern, church, yielded, to, the, emperor, s, demands, and, pope, vigilius, who, was, forcibly, brought, to, constantinople, and, besieged, at, a, chapel, finally, also, gave, his, assent, however, the, condemnation, was, received, unfavourably, in, the, west, where, it, led, to, new, albeit, temporal, schism, and, failed, to, reach, its, goal, in, the, east, as, the, monophysites, remained, unsatisfied, all, the, more, bitter, for, him, because, during, his, last, years, he, took, an, even, greater, interest, in, theological, matters, justinian, s, religious, policy, reflected, the, imperial, conviction, that, the, unity, of, the, empire, presupposed, unity, of, faith, and, it, appeared, to, him, obvious, that, this, faith, could, only, be, the, orthodoxy, chalcedonian, those, of, a, different, belief, were, subjected, to, persecution, which, imperial, legislation, had, effected, from, the, time, of, constantius, ii, and, which, would, now, vigorously, continue, the, codex, contained, two, statutes, that, decreed, the, total, destruction, of, paganism, even, in, private, life, these, provisions, were, zealously, enforced, contemporary, sources, john, malalas, theophanes, and, john, of, ephesus, tell, of, severe, persecutions, even, of, men, in, high, position, the, original, academy, of, plato, had, been, destroyed, by, the, roman, dictator, sulla, in, 86, bc, several, centuries, later, in, 410, ad, a, neoplatonic, academy, was, established, that, had, no, institutional, continuity, with, plato, s, academy, and, which, served, as, a, center, for, neoplatonism, and, mysticism, it, persisted, until, 529, ad, when, it, was, finally, closed, by, justinian, i, other, schools, in, constantinople, antioch, and, alexandria, which, were, the, centers, of, justinian, s, empire, continued, in, asia, minor, alone, john, of, ephesus, was, reported, to, have, converted, 70, 000, pagans, which, was,

the, presbyter, julian, and, the, bishop, longinus, conducted, a, mission, among, the, nabataeans, and, justinian, attempted, to, strengthen, christianity, in, yemen, by, dispatching, a, bishop, from, egypt, the, civil, rights, of, jews, were, restricted, and, their, religious, privileges, threatened, justinian, also, interfered, in, the, internal, affairs, of, the, synagogue, and, encouraged, the, jews, to, use, the, greek, septuagint, in, their, synagogues, in, constantinople, the, emperor, faced, significant, opposition, from, the, samaritans, who, resisted, conversion, to, christianity, and, were, repeatedly, in, insurrection, he, persecuted, them, with, rigorous, edicts, but, could, not, prevent, reprisals, towards, christians, from, taking, place, in, samaria, toward, the, close, of, his, reign, the, consistency, of, justinian, s, policy, meant, that, the, manicheans, too, suffered, persecution, experiencing, both, exile, and, threat, of, capital, punishment, at, constantinople, on, one, occasion, not, a, few, manicheans, after, strict, inquisition, were, executed, in, the, emperor, s, very, presence, some, by, burning, others, by, drowning, justinian, was, a, prolific, builder, the, historian, procopius, bears, witness, to, his, activities, in, this, area, under, justinian, s, reign, the, san, vitale, in, ravenna, which, features, two, famous, mosaics, representing, justinian, and, theodora, was, completed, under, the, sponsorship, of, julius, argentarius, most, notably, he, had, the, hagia, sophia, originally, a, basilica, style, church, that, had, been, burnt, down, during, the, nika, riots, splendidly, rebuilt, according, to, a, completely, different, ground, plan, under, the, architectural, supervision, of, isidore, of, miletus, and, anthemius, of, tralles, on, 26, december, 537, according, to, pseudo, codinus, justinian, stated, at, the, completion, of, this, edifice, solomon, i, have, outdone, thee, in, reference, to, the, first, jewish, temple, the, church, had, a, second, inauguration, on, 24, december, 562, after, several, reworks, made, by, isidore, the, younger, this, new, cathedral, with, its, magnificent, dome, filled, with, mosaics, remained, the, centre, of, eastern, christianity, for, centuries, another, prominent, church, in, the, capital, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, which, had, been, in, a, very, poor, state, near, the, end, of, the, 5th, century, was, likewise, rebuilt, the, church, of, saints, sergius, and, bacchus, later, renamed, little, hagia, sophia, was, also, built, between, 532, and, 536,

quality, mosaics, dating, from, justinian, s, reign, and, a, column, topped, by, a, bronze, statue, of, justinian, on, horseback, and, dressed, in, a, military, costume, was, erected, in, the, augustaeum, in, constantinople, in, 543, rivalry, with, other, more, established, patrons, from, the, constantinopolitan, and, exiled, roman, aristocracy, might, have, enforced, justinian, s, building, activities, in, the, capital, as, a, means, of, strengthening, his, dynasty, s, prestige, justinian, also, strengthened, the, borders, of, the, empire, from, africa, to, the, east, through, the, construction, of, fortifications, and, ensured, constantinople, of, its, water, supply, through, construction, of, underground, cisterns, see, basilica, cistern, to, prevent, floods, from, damaging, the, strategically, important, border, town, dara, an, advanced, arch, dam, was, built, during, his, reign, the, large, sangarius, bridge, was, built, in, bithynia, securing, a, major, military, supply, route, to, the, east, furthermore, justinian, restored, cities, damaged, by, earthquake, or, war, and, built, a, new, city, near, his, place, of, birth, called, justiniana, prima, which, was, intended, to, replace, thessalonica, as, the, political, and, religious, centre, of, illyricum, in, justinian, s, reign, and, partly, under, his, patronage, byzantine, culture, produced, noteworthy, historians, including, procopius, and, agathias, and, poets, such, as, paul, the, silentiary, and, romanus, the, melodist, flourished, on, the, other, hand, centres, of, learning, such, as, the, neoplatonic, academy, in, athens, and, the, famous, law, school, of, berytus, lost, their, importance, during, his, reign, as, was, the, case, under, justinian, s, predecessors, the, empire, s, economic, health, rested, primarily, on, agriculture, in, addition, long, distance, trade, flourished, reaching, as, far, north, as, cornwall, where, tin, was, exchanged, for, roman, wheat, within, the, empire, convoys, sailing, from, alexandria, provided, constantinople, with, wheat, and, grains, justinian, made, the, traffic, more, efficient, by, building, a, large, granary, on, the, island, of, tenedos, for, storage, and, further, transport, to, constantinople, justinian, also, tried, to, find, new, routes, for, the, eastern, trade, which, was, suffering, badly, from, the, wars, with, the, persians, one, important, luxury, product, was, silk, which, was, imported, and, then, processed, in, the, empire, in, order, to, protect, the, manufacture, of, silk, products, justinian, granted, a, monopoly, to, the, imperial, factories, in, 541, in, order, to, bypass, the, persian, landroute, justinian, established, friendly, relations, with, the, abyssinians, whom, he, wanted, to, act, as, trade, mediators, by, transporting, indian, silk, to, the, empire, the, abyssinians, however, were, unable, to, compete, with, the, persian, merchants, in, india, then, in, the, early, 550s, two, monks, succeeded, in, smuggling, eggs, of, silk, worms, from, central, asia, back, to, constantinople, and, silk, became, an, indigenous, product, gold, and, silver, were, mined, in, the, balkans, anatolia, armenia, cyprus, egypt, and, nubia, at, the, start, of, justinian, i, s, reign, he, had, inherited, a, surplus, 28, 800, 000, solidi, 400, 000, pounds, of, gold, in, the, imperial, treasury, from, anastasius, i, and, justin, i, under, justinian, s, rule, measures, were, taken, to, counter, corruption, in, the, provinces, and, to, make, tax, collection, more, efficient, greater, administrative, power, was, given, to, both, the, leaders, of, the, prefectures, and, of, the, provinces, while, power, was, taken, away, from, the, vicariates, of, the, dioceses, of, which, a, number, were, abolished, the, overall, trend, was, towards, a, simplification, of, administrative, infrastructure, according, to, brown, 1971, the, increased, professionalization, of, tax, collection, did, much, to, destroy, the, traditional, structures, of, provincial, life, as, it, weakened, the, autonomy, of, the, town, councils, in, the, greek, towns, it, has, been, estimated, that, before, justinian, i, s, reconquests, the, state, had, an, annual, revenue, of, 5, 000, 000, solidi, in, ad, 530, but, after, his, reconquests, the, annual, revenue, was, increased, to, 6, 000, 000, solidi, in, ad, 550, throughout, justinian, s, reign, the, cities, and, villages, of, the, east, thrived, although, antioch, was, struck, by, two, earthquakes, 526, 528, and, sacked, and, evacuated, by, the, persians, 540, justinian, had, the, city, rebuilt, but, on, a, slightly, smaller, scale, despite, all, these, measures, the, empire, suffered, several, major, setbacks, in, the, course, of, the, 6th, century, the, first, one, was, the, plague, which, lasted, from, 541, to, 543, and, by, decimating, the, empire, s, population, probably, created, a, scarcity, of, labor, and, a, rising, of, wages, the, lack, of, manpower, also, led, to, a, significant, increase, in, the, number, of, barbarians, in, the, byzantine, armies, after, the, early, 540s, the, protracted, war, in, italy, and, the, wars, with, the, persians, themselves, laid, a, heavy, burden, on, the, empire, s, resources, and, justinian, was, criticized, for, curtailing, the, government, run, post, service, which, he, limited, to, only, one, eastern, route, of, military, importance, during, the, 530s, it, seemed, to, many, that, god, had, abandoned, the, christian, roman, empire, there, were, noxious, fumes, in, the, air, and, the, sun, while, still, providing, daylight, refused, to, give, much, heat, the, extreme, weather, events, of, 535, 536, led, to, a, famine, such, as, had, not, been, recorded, before, affecting, both, europe, and, the, middle, east, these, events, may, have, been, caused, by, an, atmospheric, dust, veil, resulting, from, a, large, volcanic, eruption, the, historian, procopius, recorded, in, 536, in, his, work, on, the, vandalic, war, during, this, year, a, most, dread, portent, took, place, for, the, sun, gave, forth, its, light, without, brightness, and, it, seemed, exceedingly, like, the, sun, in, eclipse, for, the, beams, it, shed, were, not, clear, the, causes, of, these, disasters, are, not, precisely, known, but, volcanoes, at, the, rabaul, caldera, lake, ilopango, krakatoa, or, according, to, a, recent, finding, in, iceland, are, suspected, seven, years, later, in, 542, a, devastating, outbreak, of, bubonic, plague, known, as, the, plague, of, justinian, and, second, only, to, black, death, of, the, 14th, century, killed, tens, of, millions, justinian, and, members, of, his, court, physically, unaffected, by, the, previous, 535, 536, famine, were, afflicted, with, justinian, himself, contracting, and, surviving, the, pestilence, the, impact, of, this, outbreak, of, plague, has, recently, been, disputed, since, evidence, for, tens, of, millions, dying, is, uncertain, in, july, 551, the, eastern, mediterranean, was, rocked, by, the, 551, beirut, earthquake, which, triggered, a, tsunami, the, combined, fatalities, of, both, events, likely, exceeded, 30,

is, elaborated, on, and, he, is, portrayed, as, a, defender, of, the, christian, faith, and, the, restorer, of, rome, to, the, empire, justinian, confesses, that, he, was, partially, motivated, by, fame, rather, than, duty, to, god, which, tainted, the, justice, of, his, rule, in, spite, of, his, proud, accomplishments, in, his, introduction, cesare, fui, e, son, iustin, ano, caesar, i, was,
