edward, henry, weston, march, 24, 1886, january, 1, 1958, was, an, american, photographer, he, has, been, called, one, of, the, most, innovative, and, influential, american, photographers, and, one, of, the, masters, of, 20th, century, photography, over, the, course, of, his, 40, year, career, weston, photographed, an, increasingly, expansive, set, of, subjects, including, landscapes, still, lifes, nudes, portraits, genre, scenes, and, even, whimsical, parodies, it, is, said, that, he, developed, a, quintessentially, american, and, especially, californian, approach, to, modern, photography, because, of, his, focus, on, the, people, and, places, of, the, american, west, in, 1937, weston, was, the, first, photographer, to, receive, a, guggenheim, fellowship, and, over, the, next, two, years, he, produced, nearly, 1, 400, negatives, using, his, 8, 10, view, camera, some, of, his, most, famous, photographs, were, taken, of, the, trees, and, rocks, at, point, lobos, california, near, where, he, lived, for, many, years, weston, was, born, in, chicago, and, moved, to, california, when, he, was, 21, he, knew, he, wanted, to, be, a, photographer, from, an, early, age, and, initially, his, work, was, typical, of, the, soft, focus, pictorialism, that, was, popular, at, the, time, within, a, few, years, however, he, abandoned, that, style, and, went, on, to, be, one, of, the, foremost, champions, of, highly, detailed, photographic, images, in, 1947, he, was, diagnosed, with, parkinson, s, disease, and, he, soon, stopped, photographing, he, spent, the, remaining, ten, years, of, his, life, overseeing, the, printing, of, more, than, 1, 000, of, his, most, famous, images, weston, was, born, in, highland, park, illinois, the, second, child, and, only, son, of, edward, burbank, weston, an, obstetrician, and, alice, jeanette, brett, a, shakespearean, actress, his, mother, died, when, he, was, five, years, old, and, he, was, raised, mostly, by, his, sister, mary, whom, he, called, may, or, maisie, she, was, nine, years, older, than, he, and, they, developed, a, very, close, bond, that, was, one, of, the, few, steady, relationships, in, weston, s, life, his, father, remarried, when, he, was, nine, but, neither, weston, nor, his, sister, got, along, with, their, new, stepmother, and, stepbrother, after, may, was, married, and, left, their, home, in, 1897, weston, s, father, devoted, most, of, his, time, to, his, new, wife, and, her, son, weston, was, left, on, his, own, much, of, the, time, he, stopped, going, to, school, and, withdrew, into, his, own, room, in, their, large, home, as, a, present, for, his, 16th, birthday, weston, s, father, gave, him, his, first, camera, a, kodak, bull, s, eye, no, 2, which, was, a, simple, box, camera, he, took, it, on, vacation, in, the, midwest, and, by, the, time, he, returned, home, his, interest, in, photography, was, enough, to, lead, him, to, purchase, a, used, 5, 7, inch, view, camera, he, began, photographing, in, chicago, parks, and, a, farm, owned, by, his, aunt, and, developed, his, own, film, and, prints, later, he, would, remember, that, even, at, that, early, age, his, work, showed, strong, artistic, merit, he, said, i, feel, that, my, earliest, work, of, 1903, though, immature, is, related, more, closely, both, with, technique, and, composition, to, my, latest, work, than, are, several, of, my, photographs, dating, from, 1913, to, 1920, a, period, in, which, i, was, trying, to, be, artistic, in, 1904, may, and, her, family, moved, to, california, leaving, weston, further, isolated, in, chicago, he, earned, a, living, by, taking, a, job, at, a, local, department, store, but, he, continued, to, spend, most, of, his, free, time, taking, photos, within, two, years, he, felt, confident, enough, of, his, photography, that, he, submitted, his, work, to, the, magazine, camera, and, darkroom, and, in, the, april, 1906, issue, they, published, a, full, page, reproduction, of, his, picture, spring, chicago, this, is, the, first, known, publication, of, any, of, his, photographs, in, september, 1904, weston, took, part, in, the, men, s, double, american, round, archery, event, at, the, 1904, summer, olympics, with, his, father, also, taking, part, in, the, same, event, at, his, sister, s, urging, weston, left, chicago, in, the, spring, of, 1906, and, moved, near, may, s, home, in, tropico, california, now, a, neighborhood, in, glendale, he, decided, to, stay, there, and, pursue, a, career, in, photography, but, he, soon, realized, he, needed, more, professional, training, a, year, later, he, moved, to, effingham, illinois, to, enroll, in, the, illinois, college, of, photography, they, taught, a, nine, month, course, but, weston, finished, all, of, the, class, work, in, six, months, the, school, refused, to, give, him, a, diploma, unless, he, paid, for, the, full, nine, months, weston, refused, and, instead, moved, back, to, california, in, the, spring, of, 1908, he, briefly, worked, at, the, photography, studio, of, george, steckel, in, los, angeles, as, a, negative, retoucher, within, a, few, months, he, moved, to, the, more, established, studio, of, louis, mojonier, for, the, next, several, years, he, learned, the, techniques, and, business, of, operating, a, photography, studio, under, mojonier, s, direction, within, days, of, his, visit, to, tropico, weston, was, introduced, to, his, sister, s, best, friend, flora, may, chandler, she, was, a, graduate, of, the, normal, school, later, to, become, ucla, she, assumed, the, position, of, a, grade, school, teacher, in, tropico, she, was, seven, years, older, than, weston, and, a, distant, relative, of, harry, chandler, who, at, that, time, was, described, as, the, head, of, the, single, most, powerful, family, in, southern, california, this, fact, did, not, go, unnoticed, by, weston, and, his, biographers, on, january, 30, 1909, weston, and, chandler, married, in, a, simple, ceremony, the, first, of, their, four, sons, edward, chandler, weston, 1910, 1993, known, as, chandler, was, born, on, april, 26, 1910, named, edward, chandler, after, weston, and, his, wife, he, later, became, a, photographer, as, well, in, 1910, weston, opened, his, own, business, called, the, little, studio, in, tropico, his, sister, later, asked, him, why, he, opened, his, studio, in, tropico, rather, than, in, the, nearby, metropolis, of, los, angeles, and, he, replied, sis, i, m, going, to, make, my, name, so, famous, that, it, won, t, matter, where, i, live, for, the, next, three, years, he, worked, alone, and, sometimes, with, the, assistance, of, family, members, in, his, studio, even, at, that, early, stage, of, his, career, he, was, highly, particular, about, his, work, in, an, interview, at, that, time, he, said, photographic, plates, are, nothing, to, me, unless, i, get, what, i, want, i, have, used, thirty, of, them, at, a, sitting, if, i, did, not, secure, the, effect, to, suit, me, his, critical, eye, paid, off, for, him, and, he, quickly, gained, more, recognition, for, his, work, he, won, prizes, in, national, competitions, published, several, more, photographs, and, wrote, articles, for, magazines, such, as, photo, era, and, american, photography, championing, the, pictorial, style, on, december, 16, 1911, weston, s, second, son, theodore, brett, weston, 1911, 1993, was, born, he, became, a, long, time, artistic, collaborator, with, his, father, and, an, important, photographer, on, his, own, sometime, in, the, fall, of, 1913, los, angeles, photographer, margrethe, mather, visited, weston, s, studio, because, of, his, growing, reputation, and, within, a, few, months, they, developed, an, intense, relationship, weston, was, a, quiet, midwestern, transplant, to, california, and, mather, was, a, part, of, the, growing, bohemian, cultural, scene, in, los, angeles, she, was, very, outgoing, and, artistic, in, a, flamboyant, way, and, her, permissive, sexual, morals, were, far, different, from, the, conservative, weston, at, the, time, mather, had, been, a, prostitute, and, was, bisexual, with, a, preference, for, women, mather, presented, a, stark, contrast, to, weston, s, home, life, his, wife, flora, was, described, as, a, homely, rigid, puritan, and, an, utterly, conventional, woman, with, whom, he, had, little, in, common, since, he, abhorred, conventions, and, he, found, mather, s, uninhibited, lifestyle, irresistible, and, her, photographic, vision, intriguing, he, asked, mather, to, be, his, studio, assistant, and, for, the, next, decade, they, worked, closely, together, making, individual, and, jointly, signed, portraits, of, writers, carl, sandburg, and, max, eastman, a, joint, exhibition, of, their, work, in, 2001, revealed, that, during, this, period, weston, emulated, mather, s, style, and, later, her, choice, of, subjects, on, her, own, mather, photographed, fans, hands, eggs, melons, waves, bathroom, fixtures, seashells, and, birds, wings, all, subjects, that, weston, would, also, explore, a, decade, later, he, described, her, as, the, first, important, person, in, my, life, and, perhaps, even, now, though, personal, contact, has, gone, the, most, important, in, early, 1915, weston, began, keeping, detailed, journals, he, later, came, to, call, his, daybooks, for, the, next, two, decades, he, recorded, his, thoughts, about, his, work, observations, about, photography, and, his, interactions, with, friends, lovers, and, family, on, december, 6, 1916, a, third, son, lawrence, neil, weston, was, born, he, also, followed, in, the, footsteps, of, his, father, and, became, a, well, known, photographer, it, was, during, this, period, that, weston, first, met, photographer, johan, hagemeyer, whom, weston, mentored, and, lent, his, studio, to, from, time, to, time, later, hagemeyer, would, return, the, favor, by, letting, weston, use, his, studio, in, carmel, after, he, returned, from, mexico, for, the, next, several, years, weston, continued, to, earn, a, living, by, taking, portraits, in, his, small, studio, which, he, called, the, shack, meanwhile, flora, was, spending, all, of, her, time, caring, for, their, children, their, fourth, son, cole, weston, 1919, 2003, was, born, on, january, 30, 1919, and, afterward, she, rarely, had, time, to, leave, their, home, over, the, summer, of, 1920, weston, met, two, people, who, were, part, of, the, growing, los, angeles, cultural, scene, roubaix, de, l, abrie, richey, known, as, robo, and, a, woman, he, called, his, wife, tina, modotti, modotti, who, was, then, known, only, as, a, stage, and, film, actress, was, never, married, to, robo, but, they, pretended, to, be, for, the, sake, of, his, family, weston, and, modotti, were, immediately, attracted, to, each, other, and, they, soon, became, lovers, richey, knew, of, modotti, s, affair, but, he, continued, to, be, friends, with, weston, and, later, invited, him, to, come, to, mexico, and, share, his, studio, the, following, year, weston, agreed, to, allow, mather, to, become, an, equal, partner, in, his, studio, for, several, months, they, took, portraits, that, they, signed, with, both, of, their, names, this, was, the, only, time, in, his, long, career, that, weston, shared, credit, with, another, photographer, sometime, in, 1920, he, began, photographing, nude, models, for, the, first, time, his, first, models, were, his, wife, flora, and, their, children, but, soon, thereafter, he, took, at, least, three, nude, studies, of, mather, he, followed, these, with, several, more, photographs, of, nude, models, the, first, of, dozens, of, figure, studies, he, would, make, of, friends, and, lovers, over, the, next, twenty, years, until, now, weston, had, kept, his, relationships, with, other, women, a, secret, from, his, wife, but, as, he, began, to, photograph, more, nudes, flora, became, suspicious, about, what, went, on, with, him, and, his, models, chandler, recalled, that, his, mother, regularly, sent, him, on, errands, to, his, father, s, studio, and, asked, him, to, tell, her, who, was, there, and, what, they, were, doing, one, of, the, first, who, agreed, to, model, nude, for, weston, was, modotti, she, became, his, primary, model, for, the, next, several, years, in, 1922, he, visited, his, sister, may, who, had, moved, to, middletown, ohio, while, there, he, made, five, or, six, photographs, of, the, tall, smoke, stacks, at, the, nearby, armco, steel, mill, these, images, signaled, a, change, in, weston, s, photographic, style, a, transition, from, the, soft, focus, pictorialism, of, the, past, to, a, new, cleaner, edge, style, he, immediately, recognized, the, change, and, later, recorded, it, in, his, notes, the, middletown, visit, was, something, to, remember, most, of, all, in, importance, was, my, photographing, of, armco, that, day, i, made, great, photographs, even, stieglitz, thought, they, were, important, weston, naef, former, curator, of, photography, at, the, j, paul, getty, museum, has, praised, the, technical, virtuosity, of, weston, s, most, successful, armco, image, a, print, of, which, is, owned, by, the, getty, the, range, of, grays, across, that, forest, of, columns, has, about, every, gray, you, can, image, at, that, time, new, york, city, was, the, cultural, center, for, photography, as, an, art, form, in, america, and, alfred, stieglitz, was, the, most, influential, figure, in, photography, weston, badly, wanted, to, go, to, new, york, to, meet, with, him, but, he, did, not, have, enough, money, to, make, the, trip, his, brother, in, law, gave, him, enough, money, to, continue, on, from, middletown, to, new, york, city, and, he, spent, most, of, october, and, early, november, there, while, there, he, met, artist, charles, sheeler, and, photographers, clarence, h, white, gertrude, kasebier, as, well, as, stieglitz, weston, wrote, that, stieglitz, told, him, your, work, and, attitude, reassures, me, you, have, shown, me, at, least, several, prints, which, have, given, me, a, great, deal, of, joy, and, i, can, seldom, say, that, of, photographs, soon, after, weston, returned, from, new, york, robo, moved, to, mexico, and, set, up, a, studio, there, to, create, batiks, within, a, short, while, he, had, arranged, for, a, joint, exhibition, of, his, work, and, of, photographs, by, weston, mather, and, a, few, others, in, early, 1923, modotti, left, by, train, to, be, with, robo, in, mexico, but, he, contracted, smallpox, and, died, shortly, before, she, arrived, modotti, was, grief, stricken, but, within, a, few, weeks, she, felt, well, enough, that, she, decided, to, stay, and, carry, out, the, exhibition, that, robo, had, planned, the, show, was, a, success, and, due, in, no, small, part, to, his, nude, studies, of, modotti, it, firmly, established, weston, s, artistic, reputation, in, mexico, after, the, show, closed, modotti, returned, to, california, and, weston, and, she, made, plans, to, return, to, mexico, together, he, wanted, to, spend, a, couple, of, months, there, photographing, and, promoting, his, work, and, conveniently, he, could, travel, under, the, pretense, of, modotti, being, his, assistant, and, translator, the, week, before, he, left, for, mexico, weston, briefly, reunited, with, mather, and, took, several, nudes, of, her, lying, in, the, sand, at, redondo, beach, these, images, were, very, different, from, his, previous, nude, studies, sharply, focused, and, showing, her, entire, body, in, relation, to, the, natural, setting, they, have, been, called, the, artistic, prototypes, for, his, most, famous, nudes, those, of, charis, wilson, which, he, would, take, more, than, a, decade, later, on, july, 30, 1923, weston, his, son, chandler, and, modotti, left, on, a, steamer, for, the, extended, trip, to, mexico, his, wife, flora, and, their, other, three, sons, waved, goodbye, to, them, at, the, dock, it, s, unknown, what, flora, understood, or, thought, about, the, relationship, between, weston, and, modotti, but, she, is, reported, to, have, called, out, at, the, dock, tina, take, good, care, of, my, boys, they, arrived, in, mexico, city, on, august, 11, and, rented, a, large, hacienda, outside, of, the, city, within, a, month, he, had, arranged, for, an, exhibition, of, his, work, at, the, aztec, land, gallery, and, on, october, 17, the, show, opened, to, glowing, press, reviews, he, was, particularly, proud, of, a, review, by, marius, de, zayas, that, said, photography, is, beginning, to, be, photography, for, until, now, it, has, only, been, art, the, different, culture, and, scenery, in, mexico, forced, weston, to, look, at, things, in, new, ways, he, became, more, responsive, to, what, was, in, front, of, him, and, he, turned, his, camera, on, everyday, objects, like, toys, doorways, and, bathroom, fixtures, he, also, made, several, intimate, nudes, and, portraits, of, modotti, he, wrote, in, his, daybooks, the, camera, should, be, used, for, a, recording, of, life, for, rendering, the, very, substance, and, quintessence, of, the, thing, itself, i, feel, definite, in, the, belief, that, the, approach, to, photography, is, through, realism, weston, continued, to, photograph, the, people, and, things, around, him, and, his, reputation, in, mexico, increased, the, longer, he, stayed, he, had, a, second, exhibition, at, the, aztec, land, gallery, in, 1924, and, he, had, a, steady, stream, of, local, socialites, asking, him, to, take, their, portraits, at, the, same, time, weston, began, to, miss, his, other, sons, back, in, the, u, s, as, with, many, of, his, actions, though, it, was, a, woman, who, motivated, him, most, he, had, recently, corresponded, with, a, woman, he, had, known, for, several, years, named, miriam, lerner, and, as, her, letters, became, more, passionate, he, longed, to, see, her, again, he, and, chandler, returned, to, san, francisco, at, the, end, of, 1924, and, the, next, month, he, set, up, a, studio, with, johan, hagemeyer, weston, seemed, to, be, struggling, with, his, past, and, his, future, during, this, period, he, burned, all, of, his, pre, mexico, journals, as, though, trying, to, erase, the, past, and, started, a, new, series, of, nudes, with, lerner, and, with, his, son, neil, he, wrote, that, these, images, were, the, start, of, a, new, period, in, my, approach, and, attitude, towards, photography, his, new, relationship, with, lerner, did, not, last, long, and, in, august, 1925, he, returned, to, mexico, this, time, with, his, son, brett, modotti, had, arranged, a, joint, show, of, their, photographs, and, it, opened, the, week, he, returned, he, received, new, critical, acclaim, and, six, of, his, prints, were, purchased, for, the, state, museum, for, the, next, several, months, he, concentrated, once, again, on, photographing, folk, art, toys, and, local, scenes, one, of, his, strongest, images, of, this, period, is, of, three, black, clay, pots, that, art, historian, rene, d, harnoncourt, described, as, the, beginning, of, a, new, art, in, may, 1926, weston, signed, a, contract, with, writer, anita, brenner, for, 1, 000, to, make, photographs, for, a, book, she, was, writing, about, mexican, folk, art, in, june, he, modotti, and, brett, started, traveling, around, the, country, in, search, of, lesser, known, native, arts, and, crafts, his, contract, required, him, to, give, brenner, three, finished, prints, from, 400, 8x10, negatives, and, it, took, him, until, november, of, that, year, to, complete, the, work, during, their, travels, brett, received, a, crash, course, in, photography, from, his, father, and, he, made, more, than, two, dozen, prints, which, his, father, judged, to, be, of, exceptional, quality, by, the, time, they, returned, from, their, trip, weston, and, modotti, s, relationship, had, crumbled, and, within, less, than, two, weeks, he, and, brett, returned, to, california, he, never, traveled, to, mexico, again, weston, initially, returned, to, his, old, studio, in, glendale, previously, called, tropico, he, hastily, arranged, a, dual, exhibition, at, university, of, california, of, the, photographs, that, he, and, brett, had, made, the, year, before, the, father, showed, 100, prints, and, the, son, showed, 20, brett, was, only, 15, years, old, at, the, time, in, february, he, started, a, new, series, of, nudes, this, time, of, dancer, bertha, wardell, one, of, this, series, of, her, kneeling, body, cut, off, at, the, shoulders, is, one, of, weston, s, most, well, known, figure, studies, at, this, same, time, he, met, canadian, painter, henrietta, shore, whom, he, asked, to, comment, on, the, photos, of, wardell, he, was, surprised, by, her, honest, critique, i, wish, you, would, not, do, so, many, nudes, you, are, getting, used, to, them, the, subject, no, longer, amazes, you, most, of, these, are, just, nudes, he, asked, to, look, at, her, work, and, was, intrigued, by, her, large, paintings, of, sea, shells, he, borrowed, several, shells, from, her, thinking, he, might, find, some, inspiration, for, a, new, still, life, series, over, the, next, few, weeks, he, explored, many, different, kinds, of, shell, and, background, combinations, in, his, log, of, photographs, taken, for, 1927, he, listed, fourteen, negatives, of, shells, one, of, these, simply, called, nautilus, 1927, sometimes, called, shell, 1927, became, one, of, his, most, famous, images, modotti, called, the, image, mystical, and, erotic, and, when, she, showed, it, to, rene, d, harnoncourt, he, said, he, felt, weak, at, the, knees, weston, is, known, to, have, made, at, least, twenty, eight, prints, of, this, image, more, than, he, had, made, of, any, other, shell, image, in, september, of, that, year, weston, had, a, major, exhibition, at, the, palace, of, the, legion, of, honor, in, san, francisco, at, the, opening, of, the, show, he, met, fellow, photographer, willard, van, dyke, who, later, introduced, weston, to, ansel, adams, in, may, 1928, weston, and, brett, made, a, brief, but, important, trip, to, the, mojave, desert, it, was, there, that, he, first, explored, and, photographed, landscapes, as, an, art, form, he, found, the, stark, rock, forms, and, empty, spaces, to, be, a, visual, revelation, and, over, a, long, weekend, he, took, twenty, seven, photographs, in, his, journal, he, declared, these, negatives, are, the, most, important, i, have, ever, done, later, that, year, he, and, brett, moved, to, san, francisco, where, they, lived, and, worked, in, a, small, studio, owned, by, hagemeyer, he, made, portraits, to, earn, an, income, but, he, longed, to, get, away, by, himself, and, get, back, to, his, art, in, early, 1929, he, moved, to, johan, hagemeyer, s, cottage, in, carmel, and, it, was, there, that, he, finally, found, the, solitude, and, the, inspiration, that, he, was, seeking, he, placed, a, sign, in, studio, window, that, said, edward, weston, photographer, unretouched, portraits, prints, for, collectors, he, started, making, regular, trips, to, nearby, point, lobos, where, he, would, continue, to, photograph, until, the, end, of, his, career, it, was, there, that, he, learned, to, fine, tune, his, photographic, vision, to, match, the, visual, space, of, his, view, camera, and, the, images, he, took, there, of, kelp, rocks, and, wind, blown, trees, are, among, his, finest, looking, at, his, work, from, this, period, one, biographer, wrote, weston, arranged, his, compositions, so, that, things, happened, on, the, edges, lines, almost, cross, or, meet, and, circular, lines, just, touch, the, edges, tangentially, his, compositions, were, now, created, exclusively, for, a, space, with, the, proportions, of, eight, by, ten, there, is, no, extraneous, space, nor, is, there, too, little, in, early, april, 1929, weston, met, photographer, sonya, noskowiak, at, a, party, and, by, the, end, of, the, month, she, was, living, with, him, as, with, many, of, his, other, relationships, she, became, his, model, muse, pupil, and, assistant, they, would, continue, to, live, together, for, five, years, intrigued, by, the, many, kinds, and, shapes, of, kelp, he, found, on, the, beaches, near, carmel, in, 1930, weston, began, taking, close, ups, of, vegetables, and, fruits, he, made, a, variety, of, photographs, of, cabbage, kale, onions, bananas, and, finally, his, most, iconic, image, peppers, in, august, of, that, year, noskowiak, brought, him, several, green, peppers, and, over, a, four, day, period, he, shot, at, least, thirty, different, negatives, of, these, pepper, no, 30, is, among, the, all, time, masterpieces, of, photography, weston, had, a, series, of, important, one, man, exhibitions, in, 1930, 31, the, first, was, at, alma, reed, s, delphic, studio, gallery, in, new, york, followed, closely, by, a, mounting, of, the, same, show, at, the, denny, watrous, gallery, in, carmel, both, received, rave, reviews, including, a, two, page, article, in, the, new, york, times, magazine, these, were, followed, by, shows, at, the, de, young, museum, in, san, francisco, and, the, galerie, jean, naert, in, paris, although, he, was, succeeding, professionally, his, personal, life, was, very, complex, for, most, of, their, marriage, flora, was, able, to, take, care, of, their, children, because, of, an, inheritance, from, her, parents, however, the, wall, street, crash, of, 1929, had, wiped, out, most, of, her, savings, and, weston, felt, increased, pressure, to, help, provide, more, for, her, and, his, sons, he, described, this, time, as, the, most, trying, economic, period, of, my, life, in, 1932, the, art, of, edward, weston, the, first, book, devoted, exclusively, to, weston, s, work, was, published, it, was, edited, by, merle, armitage, and, dedicated, to, alice, rohrer, an, admirer, and, patron, of, weston, whose, 500, donation, helped, pay, for, the, book, to, be, published, during, the, same, time, a, small, group, of, like, minded, photographers, in, the, san, francisco, area, led, by, van, dyke, and, ansel, adams, began, informally, meeting, to, discuss, their, common, interest, and, aesthetics, inspired, by, weston, s, show, at, the, de, young, museum, the, previous, year, they, approached, the, museum, with, the, idea, of, mounting, a, group, exhibition, of, their, work, they, named, themselves, group, f, 64, and, in, november, 1932, an, exhibition, of, 80, of, their, prints, opened, at, the, museum, the, show, was, a, critical, success, in, 1933, weston, bought, a, 4, 5, graflex, camera, which, was, much, smaller, and, lighter, than, the, large, view, camera, he, had, used, for, many, years, he, began, taking, close, up, nudes, of, noskowiak, and, other, models, the, smaller, camera, allowed, him, to, interact, more, with, his, models, while, at, the, same, time, the, nudes, he, took, during, this, period, began, to, resemble, some, of, the, contorted, root, and, vegetables, he, had, taken, the, year, before, in, early, 1934, a, new, and, important, chapter, opened, in, weston, s, life, when, he, met, charis, wilson, at, a, concert, even, more, than, with, his, previous, lovers, weston, was, immediately, captivated, by, her, beauty, and, her, personality, he, wrote, a, new, love, came, into, my, life, a, most, beautiful, one, one, which, will, i, believe, stand, the, test, of, time, on, april, 22, he, photographed, her, nude, for, the, first, time, and, they, entered, into, an, intense, relationship, he, was, still, living, with, noskowiak, at, that, time, but, within, two, weeks, he, asked, her, to, move, out, declaring, that, for, him, other, women, were, as, inevitable, as, the, tides, perhaps, because, of, the, intensity, of, his, new, relationship, he, stopped, writing, in, his, daybooks, at, this, same, time, six, months, later, he, wrote, one, final, entry, looking, back, from, april, 22, in, january, 1935, weston, was, facing, increasing, financial, difficulties, he, closed, his, studio, in, carmel, and, moved, to, santa, monica, canyon, california, where, he, opened, a, new, studio, with, brett, he, implored, wilson, to, come, and, live, with, him, and, in, august, 1935, she, finally, agreed, while, she, had, an, intense, interest, in, his, work, wilson, was, the, first, woman, weston, had, lived, with, since, flora, who, had, no, interest, in, becoming, a, photographer, this, allowed, weston, to, concentrate, on, her, as, his, muse, and, model, and, in, turn, wilson, devoted, her, time, to, promoting, weston, s, art, as, his, assistant, and, quasi, agent, almost, immediately, he, began, taking, a, new, series, of, nudes, with, wilson, as, the, model, one, of, the, first, photographs, he, took, of, her, on, the, balcony, of, their, home, became, one, of, his, most, published, images, nude, charis, santa, monica, soon, after, they, took, the, first, of, several, trips, to, oceano, dunes, it, was, there, that, weston, made, some, of, his, most, daring, and, intimate, photographs, of, any, of, his, models, capturing, wilson, in, completely, uninhibited, poses, in, the, sand, dunes, he, exhibited, only, one, or, two, of, this, series, in, his, lifetime, thinking, several, of, the, others, were, too, erotic, for, the, general, public, although, his, recent, work, had, received, critical, acclaim, he, was, not, earning, enough, income, from, his, artistic, images, to, provide, a, steady, income, rather, than, going, back, to, relying, solely, on, portraiture, he, started, the, edward, weston, print, of, the, month, club, offering, selections, of, his, photos, for, a, monthly, 5, subscription, each, month, subscribers, would, receive, a, new, print, from, weston, with, a, limited, edition, of, 40, copies, of, each, print, although, he, created, these, prints, with, the, same, high, standards, that, he, did, for, his, exhibition, prints, it, is, thought, that, he, never, had, more, than, eleven, subscribers, at, the, suggestion, of, beaumont, newhall, weston, decided, to, apply, for, a, guggenheim, foundation, grant, now, known, as, a, guggenheim, fellowship, he, wrote, a, two, sentence, description, about, his, work, assembled, thirty, five, of, his, favorite, prints, and, sent, it, in, afterward, dorothea, lange, and, her, husband, suggested, that, the, application, was, too, brief, to, be, seriously, considered, and, weston, resubmitted, it, with, a, four, page, letter, and, work, plan, he, did, not, mention, that, wilson, had, written, the, new, application, for, him, on, march, 22, 1937, weston, received, notification, that, he, had, been, awarded, a, guggenheim, grant, the, first, ever, given, to, a, photographer, the, award, was, 2, 000, for, one, year, a, significant, amount, of, money, at, that, time, he, was, able, to, further, capitalize, on, the, award, by, arranging, to, provide, the, editor, of, aaa, westway, magazine, with, 8, 10, photos, per, month, for, 50, during, their, travels, with, wilson, getting, an, additional, 15, monthly, for, photo, captions, and, short, narratives, they, purchased, a, new, car, and, set, out, on, weston, s, dream, trip, to, go, and, photograph, whatever, he, wanted, over, the, next, twelve, months, they, made, seventeen, trips, and, covered, 16, 697, miles, according, to, wilson, s, detailed, log, weston, made, 1, 260, negatives, during, the, trip, the, freedom, of, this, trip, with, the, love, of, his, life, combined, with, all, of, his, sons, now, reaching, the, age, of, adulthood, gave, weston, the, motivation, to, finally, divorce, his, wife, they, had, been, living, apart, for, sixteen, years, due, to, the, success, of, the, past, year, weston, applied, for, and, received, a, second, year, of, guggenheim, support, although, he, wanted, to, do, some, additional, traveling, he, intended, to, use, most, of, the, money, to, allow, him, to, print, his, past, year, s, work, he, commissioned, neil, to, build, a, small, home, in, the, carmel, highlands, on, property, owned, by, wilson, s, father, they, named, the, place, wildcat, hill, because, of, the, many, domestic, cats, that, soon, occupied, the, grounds, wilson, set, up, a, writing, studio, in, what, was, intended, to, be, a, small, garage, behind, the, house, and, she, spent, several, months, writing, and, editing, stories, from, their, travels, in, 1939, seeing, california, with, edward, weston, was, published, with, photographs, by, weston, and, writing, by, wilson, finally, relieved, from, the, financial, stresses, of, the, past, and, inordinately, happy, with, his, work, and, his, relationship, weston, married, wilson, in, a, small, ceremony, on, april, 24, buoyed, by, the, success, of, their, first, book, in, 1940, they, published, california, and, the, west, the, first, edition, featuring, 96, of, weston, s, photos, with, text, by, wilson, sold, for, 3, 95, over, the, summer, weston, taught, photography, at, the, first, ansel, adams, workshop, at, yosemite, national, park, just, as, the, guggenheim, money, was, running, out, weston, was, invited, to, illustrate, a, new, edition, of, walt, whitman, s, leaves, of, grass, he, would, receive, 1, 000, for, photographs, and, 500, travel, expenses, weston, insisted, on, having, artistic, control, of, the, images, he, would, take, and, insisted, that, he, would, not, be, taking, literal, illustrations, of, whitman, s, text, on, may, 28, he, and, wilson, began, a, trip, that, would, cover, 20, 000, miles, through, 24, states, he, took, between, 700, and, 800, 8x10, negatives, as, well, as, dozens, of, graflex, portraits, on, december, 7, 1941, pearl, harbor, was, attacked, and, the, united, states, entered, world, war, ii, weston, was, near, the, end, of, the, whitman, trip, and, he, was, deeply, affected, by, the, outbreak, of, the, war, he, wrote, when, the, war, broke, out, we, scurried, home, charis, did, not, want, to, scurry, i, did, he, spent, the, first, few, months, of, 1942, organizing, and, printing, the, negatives, from, the, whitman, trip, of, the, hundreds, of, images, he, took, forty, nine, were, selected, for, publication, due, to, the, war, point, lobos, was, closed, to, the, public, for, several, years, weston, continued, to, work, on, images, centered, on, wildcat, hill, including, shots, of, the, many, cats, that, lived, there, weston, treated, them, with, the, same, serious, intent, that, he, applied, to, all, of, his, other, subjects, and, charis, assembled, the, results, into, their, most, unusual, publication, the, cats, of, wildcat, hill, which, was, finally, published, in, 1947, the, year, 1945, marked, the, beginning, of, significant, changes, for, weston, he, began, to, experience, the, first, symptoms, of, parkinson, s, disease, a, debilitating, ailment, that, gradually, stole, his, strength, and, his, ability, to, photograph, he, withdrew, from, wilson, who, at, the, same, time, began, to, become, more, involved, in, local, politics, and, the, carmel, cultural, scene, a, strength, that, originally, brought, them, together, her, lack, of, interest, in, becoming, a, photographer, herself, eventually, led, to, their, break, up, she, wrote, my, flight, from, edward, was, also, partly, an, escape, from, photography, which, had, taken, up, so, much, room, in, my, life, for, so, many, years, while, working, on, a, major, retrospective, exhibition, for, the, museum, of, modern, art, he, and, wilson, separated, weston, returned, to, glendale, since, the, land, for, their, cabin, at, wildcat, hill, still, belonged, to, wilson, s, father, within, a, few, months, she, moved, out, and, arranged, to, sell, the, property, to, him, in, february, 1946, weston, s, major, retrospective, opened, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, in, new, york, he, and, beaumont, newhall, selected, 313, prints, for, the, exhibition, and, eventually, 250, photographs, were, displayed, along, with, 11, negatives, at, that, time, many, of, his, prints, were, still, for, sale, and, he, sold, 97, prints, from, the, exhibit, at, 25, per, print, later, that, year, weston, was, asked, by, dr, george, l, waters, of, kodak, to, produce, 8, 10, kodachrome, transparencies, for, their, advertising, campaign, weston, had, never, worked, in, color, before, primarily, because, he, had, no, means, of, developing, or, printing, the, more, complicated, color, process, he, accepted, their, offer, in, no, small, part, because, they, offered, him, 250, per, image, the, highest, amount, he, would, be, paid, for, any, single, work, in, his, lifetime, he, eventually, sold, seven, color, works, to, kodak, of, landscapes, and, scenery, at, point, lobos, and, nearby, monterey, harbor, in, 1947, as, his, parkinson, s, disease, progressed, weston, began, looking, for, an, assistant, serendipitously, an, eager, young, photographic, enthusiast, dody, weston, thompson, contacted, him, in, search, of, employment, weston, mentioned, he, had, just, that, morning, written, a, letter, to, ansel, adams, looking, for, someone, seeking, to, learn, photography, in, exchange, for, carrying, his, bulky, large, format, camera, and, to, provide, a, much, needed, automobile, there, was, a, swift, meeting, of, creative, minds, for, the, remainder, of, 1947, through, the, beginning, of, 1948, dody, commuted, from, san, francisco, on, weekends, to, learn, from, weston, the, basics, of, photography, in, early, 1948, dody, moved, into, bodie, house, the, guest, cottage, at, edward, s, wildcat, hill, compound, as, his, full, time, assistant, by, late, 1948, he, was, no, longer, physically, able, to, use, his, large, view, camera, that, year, he, took, his, last, photographs, at, point, lobos, his, final, negative, was, an, image, he, called, rocks, and, pebbles, 1948, although, diminished, in, his, capacity, weston, never, stopped, being, a, photographer, he, worked, with, his, sons, and, dody, to, catalog, his, images, and, especially, to, oversee, the, publication, and, printing, of, his, work, in, 1950, there, was, a, major, retrospective, of, his, work, at, the, musee, national, d, art, moderne, in, paris, and, in, 1952, he, published, a, fiftieth, anniversary, portfolio, with, images, printed, by, brett, during, this, time, he, worked, with, cole, brett, and, dody, thompson, brett, s, wife, by, 1952, to, select, and, have, them, print, a, master, set, of, what, he, considered, his, best, work, they, spent, many, long, hours, together, in, the, darkroom, and, by, 1956, they, had, produced, what, weston, called, the, project, prints, eight, sets, of, 8, 10, prints, from, 830, of, his, negatives, the, only, complete, set, today, is, housed, at, the, university, of, california, santa, cruz, later, that, same, year, the, smithsonian, institution, displayed, nearly, 100, of, these, prints, at, a, major, exhibit, the, world, of, edward, weston, paying, tribute, to, his, accomplishments, in, american, photography, weston, died, at, his, home, on, wildcat, hill, on, new, year, s, day, 1958, his, sons, scattered, his, ashes, into, the, pacific, ocean, at, an, area, then, known, as, pebbly, beach, on, point, lobos, due, to, weston, s, significant, influence, in, the, area, the, beach, was, later, renamed, weston, beach, he, had, 300, in, his, bank, account, at, the, time, of, his, death, during, his, lifetime, weston, worked, with, several, cameras, he, began, as, a, more, serious, photographer, in, 1902, when, he, purchased, a, 5, 7, camera, when, he, moved, to, tropico, now, part, of, glendale, and, opened, his, studio, in, 1911, he, acquired, an, enormous, 11, x, 14, graf, variable, studio, portrait, camera, roi, partridge, imogen, cunningham, s, husband, later, made, an, etching, of, weston, in, his, studio, dwarfed, by, the, giant, camera, in, front, of, him, after, he, began, taking, more, portraits, of, children, he, bought, a, 3, x, 4, graflex, in, 1912, to, better, capture, their, quickly, changing, expressions, when, he, went, to, mexico, in, 1924, he, took, an, 8, 10, seneca, folding, bed, view, camera, with, several, lenses, including, a, graf, variable, and, a, wollensak, verito, while, in, mexico, he, purchased, a, used, rapid, rectilinear, lens, which, was, his, primary, lens, for, many, years, the, lens, now, in, the, george, eastman, house, did, not, have, a, manufacturer, s, name, he, also, took, to, mexico, a, 3, 4, graflex, with, a, 4, 5, tessar, lens, which, he, used, for, portraits, in, 1933, he, purchased, a, 4, 5, r, b, auto, graflex, and, used, it, thereafter, for, all, portraits, he, continued, to, use, the, seneca, view, camera, for, all, other, work, in, 1939, he, listed, the, following, items, as, his, standard, equipment, he, continued, to, use, this, equipment, throughout, his, life, prior, to, 1921, weston, used, an, orthochromatic, sheet, film, but, when, panchromatic, film, became, widely, available, in, 1921, he, switched, to, it, for, all, of, his, work, according, to, his, son, cole, after, agfa, isopan, film, came, out, in, the, 1930s, weston, used, it, for, his, black, and, white, images, for, the, rest, of, his, life, this, film, was, rated, at, about, iso, 25, but, the, developing, technique, weston, used, reduced, the, effective, rating, to, about, iso, 12, the, 8, 10, cameras, he, preferred, were, large, and, heavy, and, due, to, the, weight, and, the, cost, of, the, film, he, never, carried, more, than, twelve, sheet, film, holders, with, him, at, the, end, of, each, day, he, had, to, go, into, a, darkroom, unload, the, film, holders, and, load, them, with, new, film, this, was, especially, challenging, when, he, was, traveling, since, he, had, to, find, a, darkened, room, somewhere, or, else, set, up, a, makeshift, darkroom, made, from, heavy, canvas, in, spite, of, the, bulky, size, of, the, view, camera, weston, boasted, he, could, set, up, the, tripod, fasten, the, camera, securely, to, it, attach, the, lens, to, the, camera, open, the, shutter, study, the, image, on, the, ground, glass, focus, it, close, the, shutter, insert, the, plate, holder, cock, the, shutter, set, it, to, the, appropriate, aperture, and, speed, remove, the, slide, from, the, plate, holder, make, the, exposure, replace, the, slide, and, remove, the, plate, holder, in, two, minutes, and, twenty, seconds, the, smaller, graflex, cameras, he, used, had, the, advantage, of, using, film, magazines, that, held, either, 12, or, 18, sheets, of, film, weston, preferred, these, cameras, when, taking, portraits, because, he, could, respond, more, quickly, to, the, sitter, he, reported, that, with, his, graflex, he, once, made, three, dozen, negatives, of, tina, modotti, within, 20, minutes, in, 1946, a, representative, from, kodak, asked, weston, to, try, out, their, new, kodachrome, film, and, over, the, next, two, years, he, made, at, least, 60, 8, x, 10, color, images, using, this, film, they, were, some, of, the, last, photographs, he, took, since, by, late, 1948, he, was, no, longer, able, to, operate, a, camera, due, to, the, effects, of, his, parkinson, s, disease, during, the, first, 20, years, of, his, photography, weston, determined, all, of, his, exposure, settings, by, estimation, based, on, his, previous, experiences, and, the, relatively, narrow, tolerances, of, the, film, at, that, time, he, said, i, dislike, to, figure, out, time, and, find, my, exposures, more, accurate, when, only, felt, in, the, late, 1930s, he, acquired, a, weston, exposure, meter, and, continued, to, use, it, as, an, aid, to, determine, exposures, throughout, his, career, photo, historian, nancy, newhall, wrote, that, young, photographers, are, confused, and, amazed, when, they, behold, him, measuring, with, his, meter, every, value, in, the, sphere, where, he, intends, to, work, from, the, sky, to, the, ground, under, his, feet, he, is, feeling, the, light, and, checking, his, own, observations, after, which, he, puts, the, meter, away, and, does, what, he, thinks, often, he, adds, up, everything, filters, extension, film, speed, and, so, on, and, doubles, the, computation, weston, newhall, noted, believed, in, massive, exposure, which, he, then, compensated, for, by, hand, processing, the, film, in, a, weak, developer, solution, and, individually, inspecting, each, negative, as, it, continued, to, develop, to, get, the, right, balance, of, highlights, and, shadows, the, low, iso, rating, of, the, sheet, film, weston, used, necessitated, very, long, exposures, when, using, his, view, camera, ranging, from, 1, to, 3, seconds, for, outdoor, landscape, exposures, to, as, long, as, 4, hours, for, still, lifes, such, as, peppers, or, shells, when, he, used, one, of, the, graflex, cameras, the, exposure, times, were, much, shorter, usually, less, than, second, and, he, was, sometimes, able, to, work, without, a, tripod, weston, always, made, contact, prints, meaning, that, the, print, was, exactly, the, same, size, as, the, negative, this, was, essential, for, the, platinum, printing, that, he, preferred, early, in, his, career, since, at, that, time, the, platinum, papers, required, ultra, violet, light, to, activate, weston, did, not, have, an, artificial, ultra, violet, light, source, so, he, had, to, place, the, contact, print, directly, in, sunlight, to, expose, it, this, limited, him, to, printing, only, on, sunny, days, when, he, wanted, a, print, that, was, larger, than, the, original, negative, size, he, used, an, enlarger, to, create, a, larger, inter, positive, then, contact, printed, it, to, a, new, negative, the, new, larger, negative, was, then, used, to, make, a, print, of, that, size, this, process, was, very, labor, intensive, he, once, wrote, in, his, daybooks, i, am, utterly, exhausted, tonight, after, a, whole, day, in, the, darkroom, making, eight, contact, negatives, from, the, enlarged, positives, in, 1924, weston, wrote, this, about, his, darkroom, process, i, have, returned, after, several, years, use, of, metol, hydroquinine, open, tank, developer, to, a, three, solution, pyro, developer, and, i, develop, one, at, a, time, in, a, tray, instead, of, a, dozen, in, a, tank, each, sheet, of, film, was, viewed, under, either, a, green, or, an, orange, safelight, in, his, darkroom, allowing, him, to, control, the, individual, development, of, a, negative, he, continued, to, use, this, technique, for, the, rest, of, his, life, weston, was, known, to, extensively, use, dodging, and, burning, to, achieve, the, look, he, wanted, in, his, prints, early, in, his, career, weston, printed, on, several, kinds, of, paper, including, velox, apex, convira, defender, velour, black, and, haloid, when, he, went, to, mexico, he, learned, how, to, use, platinum, and, palladium, paper, made, by, willis, clement, and, imported, from, england, after, his, return, to, california, he, abandoned, platinum, and, palladium, printing, due, to, the, scarcity, and, increasing, price, of, the, paper, eventually, he, was, able, to, get, most, of, the, same, qualities, he, preferred, with, kodak, s, azo, glossy, silver, gelatin, paper, developed, in, amidol, he, continued, to, use, this, paper, almost, exclusively, until, he, stopped, printing, weston, was, a, prolific, writer, his, daybooks, were, published, in, two, volumes, totaling, more, than, 500, pages, in, the, first, edition, this, does, not, include, the, years, of, the, journal, he, kept, between, 1915, and, 1923,
