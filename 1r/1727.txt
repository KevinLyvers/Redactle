joseph, lister, 1st, baron, lister, om, pc, frs, frcse, frcpglas, frcs, 5, april, 1827, 10, february, 1912, was, a, british, surgeon, medical, scientist, experimental, pathologist, and, a, pioneer, of, antiseptic, surgery, and, preventive, healthcare, joseph, lister, revolutionised, the, craft, of, surgery, in, the, same, manner, that, john, hunter, revolutionised, the, science, of, surgery, from, a, technical, viewpoint, lister, was, not, an, exceptional, surgeon, but, his, research, into, bacteriology, and, infection, in, wounds, raised, his, operative, technique, to, a, new, plane, where, his, observations, deductions, and, practices, revolutionised, surgery, throughout, the, world, lister, s, contributions, were, four, fold, firstly, as, a, surgeon, at, the, glasgow, royal, infirmary, he, introduced, carbolic, acid, modern, day, phenol, as, a, steriliser, for, surgical, instruments, patients, skins, sutures, surgeons, hands, and, wards, promoting, the, principle, of, antiseptics, secondly, he, researched, the, role, of, inflammation, and, tissue, perfusion, in, the, healing, of, wounds, thirdly, he, advanced, diagnostic, science, by, analyzing, specimens, using, microscopes, fourthly, he, devised, strategies, to, increase, the, chances, of, survival, after, surgery, his, most, important, contribution, however, was, recognising, that, putrefaction, in, wounds, is, caused, by, germs, in, connection, to, louis, pasteur, s, then, novel, germ, theory, of, fermentation, lister, s, work, led, to, a, reduction, in, post, operative, infections, and, made, surgery, safer, for, patients, leading, to, him, being, distinguished, as, the, father, of, modern, surgery, lister, was, born, to, a, prosperous, educated, quaker, family, in, the, village, of, upton, then, near, but, now, in, london, england, he, was, the, fourth, child, and, second, son, of, four, sons, and, three, daughters, born, to, gentleman, scientist, and, wine, merchant, joseph, jackson, lister, and, school, assistant, isabella, lister, n, e, harris, on, 14, july, 1818, the, couple, were, married, in, a, ceremony, in, ackworth, west, yorkshire, lister, s, paternal, great, great, grandfather, thomas, lister, was, the, last, of, several, generations, of, farmers, who, lived, in, bingley, in, west, yorkshire, lister, joined, the, society, of, friends, as, a, young, man, and, passed, his, beliefs, on, to, his, son, joseph, lister, he, moved, to, london, in, 1720, to, open, a, tobacconist, in, aldersgate, street, in, the, city, of, london, his, son, john, lister, was, born, there, lister, s, grandfather, was, apprenticed, to, a, watchmaker, isaac, rogers, in, 1752, and, followed, that, trade, on, his, own, account, in, bell, alley, lombard, street, from, 1759, to, 1766, he, then, took, over, his, father, s, tobacco, business, but, gave, it, up, in, 1769, in, favour, of, working, at, his, father, in, law, stephen, jackson, s, business, as, a, wine, merchant, at, no, 28, old, wine, and, brandy, values, on, lothbury, street, opposite, tokenhouse, yard, his, father, was, a, pioneer, in, the, design, of, achromatic, object, lenses, for, use, in, compound, microscopes, he, spent, 30, years, perfecting, the, microscope, and, in, the, process, discovered, the, law, of, aplanatic, foci, building, a, microscope, where, the, image, point, of, one, lens, coincided, with, the, focal, point, of, another, up, until, that, point, the, best, higher, magnification, lenses, produced, an, excessive, secondary, aberration, known, as, a, coma, which, interfered, with, normal, use, it, was, considered, a, major, advance, that, elevated, histology, into, an, independent, science, by, 1832, lister, s, work, had, built, a, reputation, sufficient, to, enable, his, being, elected, to, the, royal, society, his, mother, isabella, was, the, youngest, daughter, of, master, mariner, anthony, harris, isabella, worked, at, the, ackworth, school, a, quaker, school, for, the, poor, assisting, her, widowed, mother, who, was, the, superintendent, of, the, school, the, eldest, daughter, of, the, couple, was, mary, lister, on, 21, august, 1851, she, married, the, barrister, rickman, godlee, of, lincoln, s, inn, and, the, middle, temple, who, belonged, to, the, friends, meeting, house, in, plaistow, the, couple, had, six, children, their, second, child, was, rickman, godlee, a, neurosurgeon, who, became, professor, of, clinical, surgery, at, the, university, college, hospital, and, surgeon, to, queen, victoria, he, became, lister, s, biographer, in, 1917, the, eldest, son, of, joseph, and, isabella, lister, was, john, lister, who, died, of, a, painful, brain, tumour, with, john, s, death, joseph, became, the, heir, of, the, family, the, couple, s, second, daughter, was, isabella, sophia, lister, who, married, the, irish, quaker, thomas, pim, in, 1848, lister, s, other, brother, was, william, henry, lister, who, died, after, a, long, illness, the, youngest, son, of, the, couple, was, arthur, lister, a, wine, merchant, botanist, and, lifelong, quaker, who, studied, mycetozoa, he, worked, alongside, his, daughter, gulielma, lister, to, produce, the, standard, monograph, on, mycetozoa, by, 1898, lister, s, work, had, built, a, reputation, sufficient, to, enable, his, being, elected, to, the, royal, society, gulielma, lister, a, talented, artist, later, updated, the, standard, monograph, with, colour, drawings, her, work, built, a, reputation, sufficient, to, enable, her, to, be, elected, a, fellow, of, the, linnean, society, in, 1904, becoming, its, vice, president, in, 1929, the, couple, s, last, child, was, jane, lister, she, married, smith, harrison, a, wholesale, tea, merchant, who, was, marrying, for, a, second, time, after, their, marriage, the, listers, lived, at, 5, tokenhouse, yard, in, central, london, for, three, years, until, 1822, where, they, ran, a, port, wine, business, in, partnership, with, thomas, barton, beck, beck, was, the, grandfather, of, the, professor, of, surgery, and, proponent, of, the, germ, theory, of, disease, marcus, beck, who, would, later, promote, lister, s, discoveries, in, his, fight, to, introduce, antiseptics, in, 1822, lister, s, family, moved, to, stoke, newington, in, 1826, the, family, moved, to, upton, house, a, long, low, queen, anne, style, mansion, that, came, with, 69, acres, of, land, it, had, been, rebuilt, in, 1731, to, suit, the, style, of, the, period, as, a, child, lister, had, a, stammer, and, this, was, possibly, the, reason, why, he, was, educated, at, home, until, he, was, eleven, lister, then, attended, isaac, brown, and, benjamin, abbott, s, academy, a, private, quaker, school, in, hitchin, in, hertfordshire, when, lister, was, thirteen, he, attended, grove, house, school, in, tottenham, also, a, private, quaker, school, to, study, mathematics, natural, science, and, languages, his, father, was, insistent, that, lister, received, a, good, grounding, in, french, and, german, in, the, knowledge, he, would, learn, latin, at, school, from, an, early, age, lister, was, strongly, encouraged, by, his, father, and, would, talk, about, his, father, s, great, influence, later, in, life, particularly, in, encouraging, him, in, his, study, of, natural, history, lister, s, interest, in, natural, history, led, him, to, study, bones, and, to, collect, and, dissect, small, animals, and, fish, that, were, examined, using, his, father, s, microscope, and, then, drawn, using, the, camera, lucida, technique, that, his, father, had, explained, to, him, or, sketched, his, father, s, interests, in, microscopical, research, developed, in, lister, the, determination, to, become, a, surgeon, and, prepared, him, for, a, life, of, scientific, research, none, of, lister, s, relatives, were, in, the, medical, profession, according, to, godlee, the, decision, to, become, a, physician, seemed, to, be, an, entirely, spontaneous, decision, in, 1843, his, father, decided, to, send, him, to, university, as, lister, was, unable, to, attend, either, university, of, oxford, or, the, university, of, cambridge, owing, to, the, religious, tests, that, effectively, barred, him, he, decided, to, apply, to, the, non, sectarian, university, college, london, medical, school, ucl, one, of, only, a, few, institutions, in, great, britain, that, accepted, quakers, at, that, time, lister, took, the, public, examination, in, the, junior, class, of, botany, a, required, course, that, would, enable, him, to, matriculate, lister, left, school, in, the, spring, of, 1844, when, he, was, seventeen, in, 1844, just, before, lister, s, seventeenth, birthday, he, moved, to, an, apartment, at, 28, london, road, that, he, shared, with, edward, palmer, who, was, also, a, quaker, between, 1844, and, 1845, lister, continued, his, pre, matriculation, studies, in, greek, latin, and, natural, philosophy, in, the, latin, and, greek, classes, he, won, a, certificate, of, honour, for, the, experimental, natural, philosophy, class, lister, won, first, prize, and, was, awarded, a, copy, of, charles, hutton, s, recreations, in, mathematics, and, natural, philosophy, although, his, father, wanted, him, to, continue, his, general, education, the, university, had, demanded, since, 1837, that, each, student, obtain, a, bachelor, of, arts, ba, degree, before, commencing, medical, training, lister, matriculated, in, august, 1845, initially, studying, for, a, ba, in, classics, between, 1845, and, 1846, lister, studied, the, mathematics, of, natural, philosophy, mathematics, and, greek, earning, a, certificate, of, honour, in, each, class, between, 1846, and, 1847, lister, studied, both, anatomy, and, atomic, theory, chemistry, and, won, a, prize, for, his, essay, on, 21, december, 1846, lister, and, palmer, attended, robert, liston, s, famous, operation, where, ether, was, applied, by, lister, s, classmate, william, squire, to, anaesthetise, a, patient, for, the, first, time, on, 23, december, 1847, lister, and, palmer, moved, to, 2, bedford, place, and, were, joined, by, john, hodgkin, the, nephew, of, thomas, hodgkin, who, discovered, hodgkin, lymphoma, lister, and, hodgkin, had, been, school, friends, in, december, 1847, lister, graduated, with, a, degree, of, bachelor, of, arts, 1st, division, with, a, distinction, in, classics, and, botany, while, he, was, studying, lister, suffered, from, a, mild, bout, of, smallpox, a, year, after, his, elder, brother, died, of, the, disease, the, bereavement, combined, with, the, stress, of, his, classes, led, to, a, nervous, breakdown, in, march, 1848, lister, s, nephew, godlee, used, the, term, to, describe, the, situation, and, is, perhaps, indicative, that, adolescence, was, just, as, difficult, in, 1847, as, it, is, now, lister, decided, to, take, a, long, holiday, to, recuperate, and, this, delayed, the, start, of, his, studies, in, late, april, 1848, lister, visited, the, isle, of, man, with, hodgkin, and, by, 7, june, 1848, he, was, visiting, ilfracombe, at, the, end, of, june, lister, accepted, an, invitation, to, stay, in, the, home, of, thoman, pim, a, dublin, quaker, using, it, as, his, base, lister, travelled, throughout, ireland, on, 1, july, 1848, lister, received, a, letter, full, of, warmth, and, love, from, his, father, where, his, last, meeting, was, sunshine, after, a, refreshing, shower, following, a, time, of, cloud, and, advised, him, to, cherish, a, pious, cheerful, spirit, open, to, see, and, to, enjoy, the, bounties, and, the, beauties, spread, around, us, not, to, give, way, to, turning, thy, thoughts, upon, thyself, nor, even, at, present, to, dwell, long, on, serious, things, from, 22, july, 1848, for, almost, a, year, the, record, is, blank, lister, registered, as, a, medical, student, in, the, winter, of, 1849, during, his, studies, lister, was, active, in, the, university, debating, society, and, the, hospital, medical, society, in, the, autumn, of, 1849, he, returned, to, college, bearing, a, gift, of, a, microscope, from, his, father, after, completing, courses, in, anatomy, physiology, and, surgery, he, was, awarded, certificate, of, honour, s, winning, the, silver, medal, in, anatomy, and, physiology, and, a, gold, medal, in, botany, his, main, lecturers, were, john, lindley, professor, of, botany, thomas, graham, professor, of, chemistry, robert, edmond, grant, professor, of, comparative, anatomy, george, viner, ellis, professor, of, anatomy, and, william, benjamin, carpenter, professor, of, medical, jurisprudence, although, lister, often, spoke, highly, about, lindley, and, graham, in, his, writings, it, was, wharton, jones, professor, of, ophthalmic, medicine, and, surgery, and, william, sharpey, professor, of, physiology, who, exercised, the, greatest, influence, on, lister, as, a, student, lister, was, greatly, attracted, by, dr, sharpey, s, lectures, which, inspired, in, him, a, love, of, experimental, physiology, and, histology, that, never, left, him, wharton, jones, was, praised, by, thomas, henry, huxley, for, the, method, and, quality, of, his, physiology, lectures, as, a, clinical, scientist, working, in, physiological, sciences, he, was, foremost, in, the, number, of, discoveries, he, made, he, was, also, considered, a, brilliant, ophthalmic, surgeon, his, main, field, he, conducted, research, into, the, circulation, of, the, blood, and, phenomena, of, inflammation, that, was, carried, out, on, the, frog, s, web, and, the, bat, s, wing, and, no, doubt, suggested, this, method, of, research, to, lister, sharpey, was, called, the, father, of, modern, physiology, as, he, was, the, first, to, give, a, series, of, lectures, on, the, subject, prior, to, that, the, field, has, been, considered, part, of, anatomy, sharpey, studied, at, edinburgh, university, then, went, to, paris, to, study, clinical, surgery, under, the, french, anatomist, guillaume, dupuytren, and, operative, surgery, under, jacques, lisfranc, de, st, martin, it, was, in, paris, that, sharpey, met, syme, and, became, life, long, friends, after, moving, to, edinburgh, he, taught, anatomy, with, allen, thomson, as, his, physiological, colleague, he, left, edinburgh, in, 1836, in, order, to, become, the, first, professor, of, physiology, at, university, college, london, before, he, qualified, for, his, degree, lister, had, to, complete, two, years, of, clinical, instruction, beginning, his, residency, at, university, college, hospital, in, october, 1850, he, began, as, an, intern, and, then, house, physician, to, walter, hayle, walshe, professor, of, pathological, anatomy, and, author, of, 1846, study, the, nature, and, treatment, of, cancer, lister, continued, his, run, of, academic, excellence, in, 1850, by, being, awarded, certificates, of, honours, and, winning, two, gold, medals, in, anatomy, and, silver, medals, in, surgery, and, medicine, then, in, his, second, year, in, 1851, lister, became, first, a, dresser, in, january, 1851, then, a, house, surgeon, to, john, eric, erichsen, in, may, 1851, erichsen, was, professor, of, surgery, and, author, of, the, 1853, science, and, art, of, surgery, described, as, one, of, the, most, celebrated, textbooks, on, surgery, in, english, the, book, went, through, many, editions, of, which, marcus, beck, edited, the, eighth, and, ninth, editions, adding, lister, s, antiseptic, techniques, and, pasteur, and, robert, koch, s, germ, theory, his, first, case, notes, were, recorded, on, 5, february, 1851, as, a, dresser, his, immediate, boss, was, henry, thompson, who, recalled, a, shy, quaker, i, remember, that, he, had, a, better, microscope, than, any, man, in, the, college, lister, had, only, just, begun, working, in, his, role, as, dresser, to, erichsen, in, january, 1851, when, there, was, an, epidemic, of, erysipelas, in, the, male, ward, an, infected, patient, who, came, from, an, islington, workhouse, was, left, in, erichsen, s, surgical, ward, for, two, hours, the, hospital, had, been, free, of, infection, but, within, days, there, were, twelve, cases, of, infection, and, four, deaths, in, his, notebook, lister, stated, that, the, disease, was, a, form, of, surgical, fever, and, particularly, noted, that, recent, surgical, patients, were, infected, the, worst, but, those, with, older, operations, with, suppurating, wounds, mostly, escaped, it, was, while, lister, worked, for, erichsen, that, his, interest, in, the, healing, of, wounds, began, erichsen, was, a, miasmist, who, thought, the, wounds, were, infected, from, miasmas, that, came, from, the, wound, itself, and, caused, a, noxious, form, of, bad, air, that, spread, to, other, patients, in, the, ward, erichsen, believed, that, 7, patients, with, an, infected, wound, had, led, to, saturation, of, the, ward, with, bad, air, that, spread, to, cause, gangrene, however, lister, took, a, more, rational, approach, seeing, that, some, wounds, when, they, were, debrided, and, cleaned, would, sometimes, heal, he, believed, that, something, in, the, wound, itself, was, at, fault, when, he, became, a, house, surgeon, lister, had, patients, put, in, his, charge, for, the, first, time, he, came, into, contact, face, to, face, with, the, various, forms, of, blood, poisoning, diseases, like, pyaemia, and, hospital, gangrene, the, disease, that, rots, living, tissue, with, a, remarkable, rapidity, while, examining, the, excision, of, the, elbow, of, a, little, boy, during, the, autopsy, who, had, died, of, pyaemia, lister, noticed, that, a, thick, yellow, pus, was, present, at, the, seat, of, the, humerus, bone, and, that, distended, the, brachial, and, axillary, veins, he, also, noticed, the, pus, advanced, in, the, reverse, direction, along, the, veins, bypassing, the, valves, in, the, veins, he, also, found, suppuration, in, a, knee, joint, and, multiple, abscesses, in, the, lungs, lister, knew, that, charles, emmanuel, s, dillot, had, discovered, that, multiple, abscesses, in, the, lungs, were, caused, by, introducing, pus, into, the, veins, of, an, animal, but, at, the, time, could, not, explain, the, facts, but, believed, the, pus, in, the, organs, had, a, metastatic, origin, on, 2, october, 1900, during, the, huxley, lecture, lister, described, how, his, interest, in, the, germ, theory, of, disease, and, how, the, theory, applied, to, surgery, began, with, his, investigation, into, the, death, of, the, little, boy, there, was, an, epidemic, of, gangrene, during, his, surgeoncy, the, method, to, effect, a, recovery, was, to, chloroform, the, patient, scrape, the, soft, slough, off, and, burn, the, necrotic, flesh, away, with, mercury, pernitrate, occasionally, the, treatment, would, be, successful, but, if, a, grey, film, appeared, at, the, edge, of, the, wound, then, it, presaged, death, in, one, patient, the, treatment, was, repeated, several, times, due, to, it, failing, resulting, in, erichsen, amputating, the, limb, which, healed, fine, the, evidence, that, lister, recognised, was, that, the, disease, was, a, local, poison, and, probably, parasitic, in, nature, he, examined, the, diseased, tissues, under, his, microscope, he, saw, peculiar, objects, that, he, could, not, identify, as, he, had, no, frame, of, reference, to, draw, conclusions, from, the, observations, in, his, notebook, he, recorded, i, imagined, they, might, be, the, materies, morbi, in, the, form, of, some, kind, of, fungus, lister, wrote, two, papers, on, the, epidemics, both, were, lost, the, first, paper, was, on, hospital, gangrene, and, the, second, was, on, the, use, of, the, microscope, they, were, read, to, the, student, medical, society, at, ucl, on, 26, june, 2013, medical, historian, ruth, richardson, and, orthopaedic, surgeon, bryan, rhodes, published, a, paper, in, which, they, described, their, discovery, of, lister, s, first, operation, made, while, both, were, researching, his, career, at, 1, pm, on, 27, june, 1851, lister, who, was, a, second, year, medical, student, and, working, at, a, casualty, ward, in, gower, street, conducted, his, first, operation, the, operation, was, on, julia, sullivan, a, mother, of, eight, grown, children, she, had, been, stabbed, in, the, abdomen, by, her, husband, a, drunk, and, ne, er, do, well, who, was, taken, into, custody, on, 15, september, 1851, lister, was, called, as, a, witness, to, his, trial, at, the, old, bailey, his, testimony, helped, convict, the, husband, who, was, transported, to, australia, for, 20, years, lister, found, the, woman, with, a, coil, of, intestine, about, eight, inches, across, consisting, of, about, a, yard, of, the, small, intestines, that, were, damaged, in, two, places, protruding, from, her, lower, abdomen, the, abdomen, itself, contained, three, open, wounds, after, cleaning, the, intestines, with, blood, warm, water, lister, was, unable, to, place, them, back, into, the, body, so, he, took, the, decision, to, extend, the, cut, they, were, then, placed, back, in, the, body, the, wounds, sewn, shut, and, the, abdomen, sutured, the, patient, was, administered, opium, to, induce, constipation, to, enable, the, intestines, to, recover, sulivan, recovered, her, health, it, was, a, full, decade, before, his, first, public, operation, in, the, glasgow, infirmary, this, operation, was, missed, by, historians, liverpool, consultant, surgeon, john, shepherd, in, his, essay, on, lister, joseph, lister, and, abdominal, surgery, written, in, 1968, failed, to, mention, the, operation, instead, starting, his, dates, from, the, 1860s, onwards, he, apparently, was, unaware, of, what, lister, accomplished, lister, wrote, his, first, paper, while, he, was, still, at, university, it, was, considered, good, enough, to, be, published, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, microscopical, science, in, 1853, on, 11, august, 1852, lister, was, presented, with, a, piece, of, a, fresh, human, iris, by, wharton, jones, at, the, university, college, hospital, lister, was, present, at, the, operation, conducted, by, jones, and, took, the, rare, opportunity, to, study, the, iris, lister, reviewed, the, existing, research, as, well, as, studying, tissue, from, a, horse, a, cat, a, rabbit, and, a, guinea, pig, as, well, as, taking, six, surgical, specimens, from, patients, who, underwent, a, surgical, operation, on, their, eye, lister, was, unable, to, complete, the, research, to, his, satisfaction, due, to, the, need, to, pass, his, final, examination, he, offered, an, apology, in, the, paper, my, engagements, do, not, allow, me, to, carry, the, inquiry, further, at, present, and, my, apology, for, offering, the, results, of, an, incomplete, investigation, is, that, a, contribution, tending, in, however, small, a, degree, to, extend, our, acquaintance, with, so, important, an, organ, as, the, eye, or, to, verify, observations, that, may, be, thought, doubtful, may, probably, be, of, interest, to, the, physiologist, the, paper, advanced, the, work, of, swiss, physiologist, albert, von, k, lliker, demonstrating, the, existence, of, two, distinct, muscles, the, dilator, and, sphincter, in, the, iris, that, corrected, the, convictions, of, previous, researchers, that, there, was, no, dilator, pupillae, muscle, his, next, paper, was, an, investigation, into, goose, bumps, that, was, published, on, 1, june, 1853, in, the, same, journal, lister, was, able, to, confirm, k, lliker, s, experimental, studies, that, in, humans, the, smooth, muscle, fibres, are, responsible, for, making, hair, stand, out, from, the, skin, in, contrast, to, other, mammals, in, which, large, tactile, hairs, are, associated, with, striated, muscle, lister, demonstrated, a, new, method, of, creating, histological, sections, from, the, tissue, of, the, scalp, lister, s, microscopy, skills, were, so, advanced, that, he, was, able, to, correct, the, observations, of, german, histologist, friedrich, gustav, henle, who, mistook, small, blood, vessels, for, muscle, fibres, in, each, of, the, papers, he, created, camera, lucida, drawings, that, were, so, accurate, that, they, could, be, used, to, scale, and, measure, the, observations, both, papers, attracted, significant, attention, both, in, britain, and, abroad, the, naturalist, richard, owen, who, was, an, old, friend, of, lister, s, father, was, particularly, impressed, by, both, papers, owen, contemplated, recruiting, lister, for, his, own, department, and, forwarded, him, a, thank, you, letter, on, 2, august, 1853, k, lliker, was, particularly, pleased, with, the, analysis, that, lister, had, formulated, k, lliker, who, made, many, trips, to, britain, would, eventually, meet, lister, and, become, life, long, friends, their, close, friendship, was, described, in, a, letter, by, k, lliker, on, 17, november, 1897, that, rickman, godlee, chose, to, use, to, illustrate, their, relationship, k, lliker, sent, a, letter, to, lister, when, he, was, president, of, the, royal, society, congratulating, lister, on, receiving, the, copley, medal, and, fondly, remembered, his, old, friends, who, had, died, and, celebrated, his, time, in, scotland, while, with, syme, and, lister, k, lliker, was, 80, years, old, at, the, time, lister, graduated, with, bachelor, of, medicine, with, honours, in, the, autumn, of, 1852, during, his, final, year, lister, won, several, prestigious, awards, that, were, heavily, contested, among, the, student, body, of, the, london, teaching, hospitals, he, won, the, longridge, prize, for, the, greatest, proficiency, evinced, during, the, three, years, immediately, preceding, on, the, sessional, examinations, for, honours, in, the, classes, of, the, faculty, of, medicine, of, the, college, and, for, creditable, performance, of, duties, of, offices, at, the, hospital, that, included, a, 40, stipend, he, was, also, awarded, a, gold, medal, in, structural, and, physiological, botany, lister, obtained, two, of, the, four, available, gold, medals, in, anatomy, and, physiology, as, well, as, surgery, which, came, with, a, medal, scholarship, of, 50, a, year, for, two, years, for, his, second, examination, in, medicine, in, the, same, year, lister, passed, the, examination, for, the, fellowship, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, bringing, to, a, close, nine, years, of, education, with, his, medical, education, completed, sharpey, advised, lister, to, spend, a, month, at, the, medical, practice, of, his, lifelong, friend, james, syme, in, edinburgh, and, then, visit, medical, schools, in, europe, for, a, longer, period, for, training, sharpey, himself, had, been, taught, first, in, edinburgh, and, later, in, paris, sharpey, had, met, syme, a, teacher, of, clinical, surgery, who, was, widely, considered, the, best, surgeon, in, the, united, kingdom, while, he, was, in, paris, sharpey, had, gone, north, to, edinburgh, in, 1818, along, with, many, other, surgeons, since, due, to, the, influence, of, john, hunter, hunter, had, taught, edward, jenner, who, is, seen, as, the, first, surgeon, to, take, a, scientific, approach, to, the, study, of, medicine, that, was, known, as, the, hunterian, method, hunter, was, an, early, advocate, for, careful, investigation, and, experimentation, using, the, techniques, of, pathology, and, physiology, to, give, himself, a, better, understanding, of, healing, than, many, of, his, colleagues, for, example, his, 1794, paper, a, treatise, on, the, blood, inflammation, and, gun, shot, wounds, was, the, first, systematic, study, of, swelling, discovering, that, inflammation, was, common, to, all, diseases, due, to, hunter, surgery, was, raised, from, a, job, then, practised, by, hobbyists, or, amateurs, into, a, true, scientific, profession, as, the, scottish, universities, taught, medicine, and, surgery, from, a, scientific, viewpoint, surgeons, who, wished, to, emulate, those, techniques, travelled, north, for, training, scottish, universities, had, several, other, features, that, distinguished, them, from, the, medical, universities, in, the, south, they, were, inexpensive, and, did, not, require, religious, admissions, tests, attracting, the, most, scientifically, progressive, students, in, britain, the, most, important, differentiator, was, that, medical, schools, in, scotland, had, evolved, from, a, scholarly, tradition, where, english, medical, schools, relied, on, hospitals, and, practice, experimental, science, had, no, practitioners, at, english, medical, schools, and, while, edinburgh, university, medical, school, was, large, and, active, at, the, time, southern, medical, schools, were, generally, moribund, their, laboratory, space, and, teaching, materials, being, inadequate, english, medical, schools, tended, to, view, surgery, as, manual, labour, not, a, respectable, calling, for, a, gentleman, academic, before, lister, s, studies, of, surgery, many, people, believed, that, chemical, damage, from, exposure, to, bad, air, or, miasma, was, responsible, for, infections, in, wounds, hospital, wards, were, occasionally, aired, out, at, midday, as, a, precaution, against, the, spread, of, infection, via, miasma, but, facilities, for, washing, hands, or, a, patient, s, wounds, were, not, available, a, surgeon, was, not, required, to, wash, his, hands, before, seeing, a, patient, in, the, absence, of, any, theory, of, bacterial, infection, such, practices, were, not, considered, necessary, despite, the, work, of, ignaz, semmelweis, and, oliver, wendell, holmes, sr, hospitals, practised, surgery, under, unsanitary, conditions, surgeons, of, the, time, referred, to, the, good, old, surgical, stink, and, took, pride, in, the, stains, on, their, unwashed, operating, gowns, as, a, display, of, their, experience, syme, was, a, well, established, clinical, lecturer, at, edinburgh, university, for, more, than, two, decades, before, he, met, lister, and, was, considered, the, boldest, and, most, original, surgeon, then, living, in, great, britain, he, became, a, surgical, pioneer, during, his, career, preferring, simpler, surgical, procedures, as, he, detested, complexity, in, the, era, that, immediately, preceded, the, introduction, of, anaesthesia, in, september, 1823, at, the, age, of, 24, syme, made, a, name, for, himself, by, first, performing, an, amputation, at, the, hip, joint, the, first, time, in, scotland, considered, the, bloodiest, operation, in, surgery, syme, completed, it, in, less, than, a, minute, as, speed, was, essential, in, a, time, before, anaesthesia, syme, became, widely, known, and, acclaimed, for, his, development, of, a, surgical, operation, that, became, known, as, syme, amputation, an, amputation, at, the, level, of, the, ankle, joint, where, the, foot, is, removed, and, the, heel, pad, is, preserved, syme, was, considered, a, scientific, surgeon, as, evidenced, by, his, paper, on, the, power, of, the, periosteum, to, form, new, bone, and, became, one, of, the, first, advocates, of, antiseptics, in, september, 1853, lister, arrived, in, edinburgh, bearing, letters, of, introduction, from, sharpey, to, syme, lister, was, anxious, about, his, first, appointment, but, decided, to, settle, in, edinburgh, after, meeting, syme, who, embraced, him, with, open, arms, invited, him, to, dinner, and, offered, him, an, opportunity, to, assist, in, his, private, operations, lister, was, invited, to, syme, s, house, millbank, in, morningside, now, part, of, astley, ainslie, hospital, where, he, met, amongst, others, agnes, syme, syme, s, daughter, by, another, marriage, and, granddaughter, of, the, physician, robert, willis, while, lister, thought, that, agnes, was, not, conventionally, pretty, he, admired, her, quickness, of, mind, her, familiarity, with, medical, practice, and, her, warmth, lister, became, a, frequent, visitor, to, millbank, and, met, a, much, wider, group, of, eminent, people, than, he, would, have, in, london, in, the, same, month, lister, began, work, as, an, assistant, to, syme, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, in, a, letter, to, his, father, lister, was, surprised, at, the, size, of, the, infirmary, and, spoke, about, his, impressions, of, syme, is, larger, than, i, expected, to, find, it, there, are, 200, surgical, beds, and, a, large, number, in, other, departments, at, university, college, hospital, there, were, only, about, 60, surgical, beds, so, altogether, a, prospect, appears, to, be, opening, of, a, very, profitable, stay, here, syme, is, i, suppose, the, first, of, british, surgeons, and, to, observe, the, practice, and, hear, the, conversation, of, such, a, man, is, of, the, greatest, possible, advantage, by, october, 1853, lister, decided, to, spend, the, winter, in, edinburgh, syme, was, so, impressed, by, lister, that, after, a, month, lister, became, syme, s, supernumerary, house, surgeon, at, the, royal, infirmary, of, edinburgh, and, his, assistant, in, his, private, hospital, at, minto, house, in, chambers, street, as, house, surgeon, he, assisted, syme, during, every, operation, taking, notes, it, was, a, much, coveted, position, and, gave, lister, the, option, of, choosing, which, of, the, ordinary, cases, he, would, attend, during, this, period, lister, presented, a, paper, at, the, royal, edinburgh, medico, chirurgical, society, on, the, structure, of, cancellous, exostoses, that, had, been, removed, by, syme, demonstrating, that, the, method, of, ossification, of, these, growths, was, the, same, as, that, which, occurs, in, epiphyseal, cartilage, in, september, 1854, lister, s, house, surgeoncy, appointment, was, finished, with, the, prospect, of, being, out, of, a, job, he, had, spoken, to, his, father, about, seeking, a, position, at, the, royal, free, hospital, in, london, however, sharpey, had, written, to, syme, warning, him, that, it, was, unlikely, that, lister, would, be, welcome, at, the, royal, free, as, he, would, have, likely, eclipsed, thomas, h, wakley, whose, father, held, considerable, sway, at, the, hospital, lister, then, planned, to, tour, europe, for, a, year, however, an, opportunity, presented, itself, when, the, noted, infirmary, surgeon, and, surgical, lecturer, at, the, edinburgh, extramural, school, of, medicine, richard, james, mackenzie, had, died, mackenzie, had, been, seen, as, a, successor, to, syme, but, had, contracted, cholera, in, balbec, in, scutari, istanbul, while, on, a, four, month, volunteer, sabbatical, as, field, surgeon, to, the, 79th, highlanders, during, the, crimean, war, lister, took, advantage, of, the, situation, and, proposed, to, syme, that, he, take, over, mackenzie, s, position, to, become, assistant, surgeon, to, syme, syme, initially, rejected, the, idea, as, lister, was, not, licensed, to, operate, in, scotland, but, later, warmed, to, the, idea, in, october, 1854, lister, was, appointed, a, lecturer, lister, successfully, transferred, the, lease, held, by, mackenzie, at, his, lecture, room, at, 4, high, school, yards, to, himself, on, 21, april, 1855, lister, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, of, edinburgh, and, two, days, later, rented, a, house, at, 3, rutland, square, for, living, in, june, 1855, lister, made, a, hurried, trip, to, paris, to, take, a, course, on, operative, surgery, on, the, dead, body, and, returned, in, june, on, 7, november, 1855, lister, gave, his, first, extramural, lecture, on, the, principles, and, practice, of, surgery, in, a, lecture, theatre, at, 4, high, school, yards, known, as, old, jerusalem, and, directly, located, across, from, the, infirmary, his, first, lecture, was, read, from, 21, pages, of, foolscap, folio, lister, s, first, lectures, were, based, on, notes, either, read, or, spoken, but, over, time, he, used, them, less, and, less, becoming, extempore, in, his, speech, slowly, and, deliberately, forming, his, argument, as, he, went, along, by, this, deliberate, way, of, speaking, he, managed, to, overcome, a, slight, occasional, stammer, which, in, his, early, days, had, been, more, pronounced, his, first, student, was, john, batty, tuke, in, a, class, of, nine, or, ten, mostly, consisting, of, dressers, within, a, week, twenty, three, people, had, joined, in, the, next, year, only, eight, folk, turned, up, in, the, summer, of, 1858, lister, had, the, ignominious, experience, of, reading, his, lecture, to, a, single, student, who, arrived, ten, minutes, late, seven, more, students, arrived, later, his, first, lecture, focused, on, the, concept, of, surgery, stating, a, definition, of, disease, that, linked, it, to, the, hippocratic, oath, he, then, explained, that, surgery, could, have, more, benefits, than, medicines, that, could, only, comfort, the, patient, at, best, he, then, explained, the, attributes, a, good, surgeon, should, exhibit, before, finishing, the, lecture, by, recommending, syme, s, book, principles, of, surgery, lister, completed, 114, lectures, that, followed, a, standard, syllabus, lecture, vii, described, his, earliest, experiment, on, inflammation, when, he, put, mustard, on, his, arm, and, watched, the, results, lectures, iv, to, ix, dealt, with, the, circulation, of, blood, inflammation, was, discussed, in, lectures, x, to, xiii, the, second, half, of, the, course, dealt, with, clinical, surgery, for, the, last, 4, days, he, gave, 2, lectures, a, day, in, order, to, complete, the, event, before, his, marriage, with, the, first, course, ending, on, 18, april, 1856, in, the, summer, of, 1858, lister, started, a, second, completely, separate, course, where, he, lectured, on, surgical, pathology, and, operative, surgery, by, mid, summer, 1854, lister, realised, that, he, was, attracted, to, agnes, syme, and, he, started, to, court, her, lister, wrote, to, his, father, and, mother, about, his, love, but, both, his, parents, were, concerned, about, the, union, particularly, concerning, the, fact, he, was, quaker, and, agnes, had, no, indication, that, she, was, going, to, change, her, denomination, during, that, time, when, a, quaker, married, a, person, of, another, denomination, it, would, be, considered, as, marrying, out, of, the, society, lister, was, determined, to, marry, agnes, and, sent, a, further, letter, to, his, father, asking, his, father, if, his, financial, support, would, continue, should, lister, and, agnes, become, married, lister, s, father, replied, that, agnes, not, being, in, the, society, of, friends, would, not, affect, his, pecuniary, arrangements, joseph, jackson, offered, his, son, extra, money, to, buy, furniture, and, suggested, that, syme, would, offer, a, dowry, and, that, he, would, negotiate, with, syme, directly, on, it, his, father, suggested, that, lister, should, voluntarily, resign, from, the, society, of, friends, lister, made, up, his, mind, and, subsequently, left, the, quakers, to, become, a, protestant, later, joining, the, congregation, of, the, saint, paul, s, episcopal, church, in, jeffrey, street, edinburgh, in, august, 1855, lister, became, engaged, to, agnes, syme, on, 23, april, 1856, lister, married, agnes, syme, in, the, drawing, room, of, millbank, syme, s, house, in, morningside, agnes, s, sister, stated, that, this, was, out, of, consideration, of, any, quaker, relations, only, the, syme, family, were, present, the, scottish, physician, and, family, friend, john, brown, toasted, the, couple, after, the, reception, on, their, honeymoon, the, couple, spent, a, month, at, upton, and, the, lake, district, followed, by, three, months, on, a, tour, of, the, leading, medical, institutes, in, france, germany, switzerland, and, italy, the, couple, returned, in, october, 1856, by, this, time, agnes, was, enamoured, with, medical, research, and, became, lister, s, partner, in, the, laboratory, for, the, rest, of, her, life, when, they, returned, to, edinburgh, the, couple, moved, into, a, rented, house, at, 11, rutland, street, in, edinburgh, the, house, was, situated, over, three, floors, with, a, study, on, the, first, floor, that, was, converted, into, a, consulting, room, for, patients, and, a, room, with, hot, and, cold, taps, on, the, second, floor, that, became, his, laboratory, the, scottish, surgeon, watson, cheyne, who, was, almost, a, surrogate, son, to, lister, stated, after, his, death, that, agnes, had, entered, into, her, work, wholeheartedly, had, been, his, only, secretary, and, that, they, discussed, his, work, on, an, almost, equal, footing, lister, s, books, are, full, of, agnes, careful, handwriting, agnes, would, take, dictation, from, lister, taken, at, hours, at, a, stretch, spaces, would, be, left, blank, amongst, the, reams, of, agnes, handwriting, for, small, diagrams, that, lister, would, create, using, the, camera, lucida, technique, and, agnes, would, later, paste, in, on, 13, october, 1856, he, was, unanimously, elected, to, the, position, of, assistant, surgeoncy, at, edinburgh, royal, infirmary, in, 1856, he, was, also, elected, a, member, of, the, harveian, society, of, edinburgh, while, he, was, in, edinburgh, lister, conducted, a, series, of, physiological, and, pathological, experiments, between, the, years, 1853, and, 1859, his, approach, was, rigorous, and, meticulous, in, both, measurement, and, description, lister, was, clearly, aware, of, the, latest, advances, in, physiological, research, in, france, germany, and, other, european, countries, and, maintained, an, ongoing, discussion, of, his, observations, and, results, with, other, leading, physicians, in, his, peer, group, including, albert, von, k, lliker, wilhelm, von, wittich, theodor, schwann, and, rudolf, virchow, and, ensured, he, correctly, cited, their, work, lister, s, primary, instrument, of, research, was, his, microscope, and, his, primary, research, material, were, frogs, before, his, honeymoon, the, couple, had, visited, his, uncle, s, house, in, kinross, lister, had, taken, his, microscope, and, captured, several, frogs, intending, to, use, them, in, the, study, of, inflammation, but, they, escaped, when, he, returned, from, his, honeymoon, he, used, frogs, captured, from, duddingston, loch, in, his, experiments, lister, carried, out, his, experiments, in, his, laboratory, and, in, the, veterinary, college, abattoir, on, animals, that, were, either, dead, or, when, they, were, chloroformed, if, lister, was, using, a, frog, they, were, pithed, to, deprive, them, of, sensation, he, also, used, bats, sheep, cats, rabbits, oxen, and, horses, in, his, experiments, lister, was, tireless, in, his, pursuit, of, knowledge, and, this, is, illustrated, by, thomas, annandale, his, assistant, who, stated, i, confess, that, on, more, than, one, occasion, our, patience, was, a, little, tried, by, the, long, hours, were, thus, engaged, and, more, particularly, when, the, dinner, hour, was, many, hours, overdue, but, no, one, could, work, with, mr, lister, without, imbibing, some, of, his, enthusiasm, these, experiments, resulted, in, the, publication, of, eleven, papers, between, 1857, and, 1859, they, included, the, study, of, the, nervous, control, of, arteries, the, earliest, stages, of, inflammation, the, early, stages, of, coagulation, the, structure, of, nerve, fibres, and, the, study, of, the, nervous, control, of, the, gut, with, reference, to, sympathetic, nerves, he, continued, the, experiments, for, three, years, until, he, was, appointed, to, a, position, at, the, university, of, glasgow, in, a, letter, dated, 16, september, 1855, lister, recorded, the, beginnings, of, his, research, into, inflammation, six, weeks, before, his, lectures, were, to, begin, inflammation, was, the, subject, that, would, preoccupy, him, for, the, rest, of, his, life, later, in, life, lister, stated, that, he, considered, his, research, into, the, nature, of, inflammation, to, be, an, essential, preliminary, to, his, conception, of, the, antiseptic, principle, and, insisted, these, early, findings, be, included, in, any, memorial, volume, of, his, work, in, 1905, when, he, was, seventy, eight, years, old, he, wrote, if, my, works, are, read, when, i, am, gone, these, will, be, the, ones, most, highly, thought, of, inflammation, is, defined, by, four, symptoms, heat, redness, swelling, and, pain, for, surgeons, prior, to, lister, this, meant, the, arrival, of, suppuration, or, putrefaction, meaning, local, or, general, infection, as, the, germ, theory, of, disease, had, not, been, discovered, infection, as, a, concept, did, not, exist, however, lister, knew, that, the, phenomena, of, the, slowing, of, the, blood, through, the, capillaries, seemed, to, precede, inflammation, joseph, jackson, lister, had, written, a, paper, with, thomas, hodgkin, that, described, how, blood, cells, behaved, prior, to, a, clot, i, e, specifically, how, the, concave, cells, fitted, themselves, together, into, stacks, lister, knew, that, to, observe, the, next, step, it, was, important, that, the, tissue, remain, alive, so, the, blood, vessels, could, be, observed, through, the, microscope, in, september, 1855, lister, s, first, experiment, was, on, the, artery, of, a, frog, viewed, under, his, microscope, which, was, subjected, to, a, water, droplet, of, differing, temperatures, to, determine, the, early, stage, of, inflammation, he, initially, applied, a, water, droplet, at, 80, f, 27, c, which, caused, the, artery, to, contract, for, a, second, and, the, flow, ceased, then, dilated, and, the, area, turned, red, and, the, flow, of, blood, increased, he, progressively, increased, the, temperature, until, it, was, 200, f, 93, c, the, blood, slowed, down, and, then, coagulated, he, continued, the, experiment, on, the, wing, of, chloroformed, bat, to, widen, his, research, focus, lister, concluded, that, the, contraction, of, the, vessels, led, to, the, exclusion, of, blood, cells, from, the, capillaries, not, their, arrest, and, blood, serum, continued, to, flow, this, was, his, first, independent, discovery, the, experiments, ceased, between, october, 1855, and, continued, in, september, 1856, when, the, couple, moved, into, rutland, square, lister, started, with, mustard, as, an, irritant, then, croton, oil, acetic, acid, oil, of, cantharidin, and, chloroform, and, many, others, they, led, to, the, production, of, three, papers, his, first, paper, grew, out, of, the, need, to, prepare, for, these, extramural, lectures, and, had, begun, the, year, before, continuing, in, development, for, six, weeks, after, he, moved, into, rutland, street, the, early, paper, titled, on, the, early, stages, of, inflammation, as, observed, in, the, foot, of, a, frog, was, read, to, the, royal, college, of, surgeons, of, edinburgh, on, 5, december, 1856, the, last, third, was, read, out, extempore, lister, s, research, into, the, process, of, coagulation, was, the, second, major, area, of, investigation, that, he, conducted, during, this, period, he, had, observed, during, inflammation, in, certain, cases, of, septicaemia, that, it, affected, the, blood, vessels, lining, leading, to, intravascular, blood, clotting, that, led, to, putrefaction, and, secondary, haemorrhage, in, wounds, beginning, with, a, simple, experiment, in, december, 1856, that, was, described, in, a, note, by, agnes, where, he, pricked, his, own, finger, to, observe, the, process, of, coagulation, it, led, to, five, physiology, papers, on, coagulation, between, 1858, and, the, last, in, 1863, there, were, several, competing, theories, that, explained, the, occurrence, of, a, blood, clot, and, although, the, theories, were, largely, abandoned, it, was, still, thought, that, blood, contained, a, liquifying, agent, i, e, fibrin, held, in, a, solution, of, ammonia, that, became, known, as, the, ammonia, theory, in, 1824, charles, scudamore, had, proposed, carbonic, acid, as, the, solution, the, prevailing, theory, was, from, benjamin, ward, richardson, who, won, the, 1857, astley, cooper, triennial, prize, for, his, essay, where, he, postulated, that, blood, remained, liquid, due, the, presence, of, ammonia, in, the, same, year, ernst, wilhelm, von, br, cke, proposed, that, the, vital, actions, of, the, vessels, inhibited, the, blood, s, natural, tendency, to, coagulate, lister, s, third, paper, was, published, in, 1858, in, the, same, journal, and, was, read, before, the, royal, society, of, edinburgh, on, 1, december, 1856, it, was, research, into, the, histology, and, function, of, the, minute, structures, of, involuntary, muscle, fibres, the, experiment, was, conducted, in, the, autumn, of, 1856, and, was, designed, to, confirm, k, lliker, s, observations, on, the, structure, of, individual, muscle, fibres, k, lliker, description, had, been, criticised, as, he, had, used, needles, to, separate, the, tissue, to, observe, the, individual, cells, so, his, critics, stated, that, he, had, observed, artefacts, for, the, experiment, rather, than, the, real, muscle, cells, lister, proved, conclusively, that, the, muscle, fibres, of, blood, vessels, described, by, lister, as, slightly, flattened, elongated, elements, were, similar, to, those, found, by, k, lliker, in, pig, intestine, but, were, wrapped, spirally, and, individually, around, the, innermost, membrane, he, stated, that, the, different, variations, in, shape, from, long, tubular, bodies, with, pointed, ends, and, elongated, nuclei, to, short, spindles, with, squat, nuclei, were, due, to, different, phases, of, the, contraction, during, the, huxley, lecture, he, stated, he, could, not, imagine, a, more, efficient, mechanism, being, used, to, constrict, these, vessels, his, next, paper, was, a, short, report, based, on, observations, that, he, made, in, 1853, this, first, experiment, by, lister, as, opposed, to, purely, microscope, work, was, to, prove, two, goals, firstly, to, determine, the, nature, of, the, flow, of, chyle, in, the, lymphatics, and, secondly, to, determine, if, the, lacteals, in, the, gastrointestinal, wall, could, absorb, solid, matter, in, the, form, of, granules, from, the, lumen, for, the, first, experiment, a, mouse, that, was, fed, beforehand, on, bread, and, milk, was, chloroformed, and, then, had, its, abdomen, opened, and, a, length, of, intestine, placed, on, glass, under, a, microscope, lister, repeated, the, experiment, several, times, and, each, time, saw, mesenteric, lymph, flowing, in, a, steady, stream, without, visible, contractions, of, the, lacteals, for, the, second, experiment, lister, dyed, some, bread, with, indigo, dye, and, fed, it, to, a, mouse, with, the, result, that, no, indigo, particles, were, ever, seen, in, the, chyle, lister, delivered, the, paper, to, the, 27th, meeting, of, the, british, medical, association, that, was, held, in, dublin, between, 26, august, to, 2, september, 1857, the, paper, was, formally, published, in, 1858, in, the, quarterly, journal, of, microscopical, science, in, 1858, lister, published, seven, papers, on, physiological, experiments, he, conducted, on, the, origin, and, mechanism, of, inflammation, two, of, these, papers, were, research, into, the, neural, control, by, the, nervous, system, of, blood, vessels, an, inquiry, regarding, the, parts, of, the, nervous, system, which, regulate, the, contractions, of, the, arteries, and, on, the, cutaneous, pigmentary, system, of, the, frog, while, the, third, and, the, principal, paper, in, the, series, was, titled, on, the, early, stages, of, inflammation, which, extended, the, research, by, wharton, jones, the, three, papers, were, read, to, the, royal, society, of, london, on, 18, june, 1857, they, had, originally, been, written, as, one, paper, and, had, been, sent, to, sharpey, john, goodsir, and, the, english, pathologist, james, paget, for, review, however, paget, and, goodsir, both, recommended, that, it, should, be, published, as, three, separate, papers, the, first, of, these, series, of, experiments, was, designed, to, satisfy, a, contemporary, dispute, between, physiologists, concerning, the, origin, of, the, influence, exercised, over, blood, vessel, diameter, calibre, by, the, sympathetic, nervous, system, the, dispute, began, when, albrecht, von, haller, formulated, a, new, theory, known, as, sensibility, and, irritability, in, his, 1752, thesis, de, partibus, corporis, humani, sensibilibus, et, irritabilibus, the, dispute, had, been, debated, since, the, middle, of, the, 18th, century, haller, put, forward, the, view, that, contractability, was, a, power, inherent, in, the, tissues, which, possessed, it, and, was, fundamental, fact, of, physiology, it, concerned, the, property, of, irratability, the, supposed, automatic, response, of, muscular, tissue, especially, visceral, tissue, to, external, stimulus, that, caused, them, to, contract, when, stimulated, even, as, late, as, 1853, highly, respected, textbooks, for, example, william, benjamin, carpenter, principles, of, human, physiology, stated, the, doctrine, of, irritability, was, a, fact, beyond, dispute, and, was, still, considered, contentious, when, john, hughes, bennett, created, the, physiology, article, for, the, 8th, edition, of, encyclop, dia, britannica, in, 1859, in, his, experiments, that, he, started, in, the, autumn, of, 1856, lister, used, a, microscope, fitted, with, ocular, micrometer, to, measure, the, diameter, of, blood, vessels, in, a, frogs, web, in, a, before, and, after, experiment, he, ablated, parts, of, the, central, nervous, system, and, also, before, and, after, with, the, splitting, of, the, sciatic, nerve, lister, concluded, that, blood, vessel, tone, was, controlled, by, the, medulla, oblongata, and, the, spinal, cord, this, refuted, wharton, s, conclusions, in, his, paper, observations, on, the, state, of, the, blood, and, the, blood, vessels, in, inflammation, who, was, not, able, to, confirm, that, the, control, of, blood, vessels, of, the, hind, legs, was, dependent, upon, spinal, centres, the, second, part, of, the, original, paper, was, an, experiment, into, the, nature, and, behaviour, of, pigment, it, had, been, known, for, some, years, that, the, skin, of, the, frog, is, capable, of, varying, in, colour, under, different, circumstances, the, first, account, of, this, mechanism, and, how, it, is, affected, had, been, first, described, by, ernst, wilhelm, von, br, cke, of, vienna, in, 1832, and, later, investigated, further, by, wilhelm, von, wittich, in, 1854, and, emile, harless, in, 1947, lister, had, seen, how, the, beginning, of, inflammation, was, always, accompanied, by, a, change, of, colour, in, the, frog, s, web, he, determined, that, the, pigments, consisted, of, very, minute, pigment, granules, that, are, contained, in, a, network, of, stellate, cells, the, branches, of, which, subdividing, minutely, and, anastomosing, freely, with, one, another, and, with, those, of, neighbouring, cells, constitute, a, delicate, network, in, the, substance, of, the, true, skin, it, had, been, supposed, that, the, concentration, and, diffusion, of, the, pigment, depended, upon, the, contraction, and, extension, of, the, branches, of, the, star, shaped, cells, in, which, it, was, contained, and, that, only, these, movements, of, the, cells, were, under, the, influence, of, the, nervous, system, at, the, time, there, was, no, cell, theory, of, matter, nor, was, there, any, dyes, or, fixatives, that, could, used, to, enhance, experimental, discovery, indeed, lister, wrote, of, this, stating, the, extreme, delicacy, of, the, cell, wall, makes, it, very, difficult, to, trace, it, among, the, surrounding, tissue, lister, observed, that, it, was, the, pigment, granules, themselves, and, not, the, cells, that, moved, and, that, this, movement, is, not, merely, brought, about, by, the, control, of, the, nervous, system, but, that, it, may, be, caused, by, the, direct, action, of, irritants, on, the, tissues, themselves, he, believed, that, pigment, reflected, the, activity, of, blood, vessels, though, it, was, the, slowing, of, blood, flow, that, initiated, the, process, of, inflammation, the, focal, study, was, the, longest, paper, of, the, three, and, the, last, to, be, published, like, many, of, his, colleagues, lister, was, aware, that, inflammation, was, the, first, stage, of, many, postoperative, conditions, and, that, excessive, inflammation, often, preceded, the, onset, of, a, septic, condition, once, that, happened, the, patient, would, develop, a, fever, lister, had, come, to, the, conclusion, that, accurate, knowledge, of, the, functioning, of, inflammation, could, not, be, obtained, by, researching, the, more, advanced, stages, that, were, subject, to, secondary, processes, he, therefore, started, in, quite, a, different, way, from, that, of, almost, all, his, predecessors, by, directing, his, enquiry, to, the, very, first, deviations, from, health, hoping, to, find, in, them, the, essential, character, of, the, morbid, state, most, unequivocally, stamped, essentially, lister, performed, these, experiments, to, discover, the, causes, of, erythrocyte, adhesiveness, as, well, as, experimenting, on, frogs, web, and, bats, wing, lister, used, blood, that, he, had, obtained, from, the, end, of, his, own, finger, that, was, inflamed, and, compared, it, against, blood, from, one, of, his, other, fingers, he, discovered, that, after, something, irritating, had, been, applied, to, living, tissues, which, did, not, kill, them, outright, firstly, the, blood, vessels, contracted, and, their, lumen, became, very, small, the, part, became, pale, secondly, the, vessels, after, an, interval, dilated, and, the, part, became, red, thirdly, some, of, the, blood, in, the, most, injured, blood, vessels, slowed, down, in, its, flow, and, coagulated, redness, occurred, which, being, solid, could, not, be, pressed, away, lastly, the, fluid, of, the, blood, passed, through, the, vessel, walls, and, formed, a, blister, about, the, seat, of, injury, he, found, that, each, tiny, artery, was, surrounded, by, a, muscle, which, enables, it, to, contract, and, dilate, he, found, further, that, this, contraction, and, dilation, was, not, an, individual, act, on, its, part, but, was, an, act, dictated, to, it, by, the, nervous, cells, in, the, spinal, cord, the, paper, was, divided, into, four, sections, lister, s, paper, was, able, to, show, that, capillary, action, is, governed, by, the, constriction, and, dilation, of, the, arteries, the, action, is, affected, by, trauma, irritation, or, reflex, action, through, the, central, nervous, system, he, noticed, that, although, the, capillary, walls, lack, muscle, fibres, they, are, very, elastic, and, are, subject, to, significant, capacity, variations, that, are, influenced, by, arterial, blood, flow, into, the, circulatory, system, drawings, made, with, a, camera, lucida, were, used, to, depict, the, experimental, reactions, they, displayed, vascular, stasis, and, congestion, in, the, early, stages, of, the, body, s, reaction, to, damage, according, to, lister, vascular, alterations, that, were, initially, brought, on, by, reflexes, occurring, within, the, nervous, system, were, followed, by, changes, that, were, brought, on, by, local, tissue, damage, in, the, conclusions, of, the, paper, lister, linked, his, experimental, observations, to, physical, clinical, conditions, for, example, skin, damage, resulting, from, boiling, water, and, trauma, occurring, after, a, surgical, incision, after, the, paper, was, read, to, the, royal, society, in, june, 1857, it, was, very, well, received, and, his, name, became, known, outside, edinburgh, lister, s, first, paper, is, an, account, of, a, case, of, spontaneous, gangrene, in, a, child, the, paper, on, coagulation, was, read, before, the, medico, chirugical, society, of, edinburgh, on, 18, march, 1858, in, an, account, written, by, agnes, she, states, that, there, was, no, one, at, the, medical, school, meeting, who, was, capable, of, appreciating, it, and, the, remarks, made, upon, it, were, very, poor, there, were, suggestions, for, improvement, which, lister, threw, out, there, was, lots, of, cheering, proclaiming, it, a, great, success, the, paper, was, written, up, at, 7pm, with, lister, dictating, and, agnes, writing, it, during, a, 50, minute, session, followed, by, the, exposition, to, the, society, at, george, street, hall, at, 8pm, lister, first, used, the, amputated, legs, from, sheep, and, discovered, that, blood, remained, liquid, in, the, blood, vessels, for, up, to, six, days, and, still, underwent, coagulation, albeit, more, slowly, when, the, vessel, was, opened, he, also, noticed, that, if, vessels, remained, fresh, the, blood, would, remain, fluid, in, later, experiments, he, moved, to, cats, he, tried, to, emulate, an, inflamed, blood, vessel, by, exposing, the, jugular, vein, of, the, animal, and, applying, irritants, then, constricting, and, opening, the, flow, to, measure, the, effect, he, noticed, that, in, the, damaged, vessel, the, blood, would, coagulate, he, eventually, came, to, the, conclusion, that, if, there, was, ammonia, in, the, blood, it, was, much, less, important, than, the, condition, of, the, vessel, in, stopping, coagulation, he, tested, his, hypothesis, on, three, cadavers, by, examining, the, condition, of, various, veins, and, arteries, and, found, he, was, correct, he, also, concluded, that, the, ammonia, theory, did, not, apply, to, vessels, in, the, body, but, it, could, apply, to, blood, outside, the, body, while, that, was, incorrect, his, other, conclusions, were, accurate, specifically, that, inflammation, in, the, blood, vessel, lining, results, in, coagulation, occurring, lister, realised, that, vascular, occlusion, increased, the, pressure, through, the, network, of, small, vessels, leading, to, the, formation, of, liquor, sanguinis, that, lead, to, further, localised, damaged, perfusion, certainly, lister, had, no, knowledge, of, the, coagulation, cascade, but, his, experiments, contributed, to, the, current, understanding, of, clotting, the, final, product, of, coagulation, lister, continued, experimenting, in, april, examining, vessels, and, blood, from, a, horse, this, resulted, in, another, communication, to, the, society, on, 7, april, his, work, in, coagulation, continued, until, the, end, of, the, year, lister, s, second, article, on, coagulation, was, published, in, august, 1958, and, was, one, of, two, case, histories, he, published, in, the, edinburgh, medical, journal, in, 1858, titled, case, of, ligature, of, the, brachial, artery, illustrating, the, persistent, vitality, of, the, tissues, the, history, described, saving, a, patient, s, arm, from, being, amputated, which, had, been, constricted, by, a, tourniquet, for, thirty, hours, the, second, history, was, titled, example, of, mixed, aortic, aneurysm, and, published, in, december, 1858, lister, continual, interest, in, the, nervous, control, of, blood, vessels, led, him, to, conduct, a, series, of, experiments, during, june, and, july, 1858, where, he, researched, the, nervous, control, of, the, gut, the, research, was, published, in, the, form, of, three, letters, sent, to, sharpey, the, first, two, letters, were, sent, on, 28, june, and, 7, july, 1858, the, last, letter, was, published, as, the, preliminary, account, of, an, inquiry, into, the, functions, of, the, visceral, nerves, with, special, reference, to, the, so, called, inhibitory, system, he, had, been, studying, the, work, of, claude, bernard, lj, budge, and, augustus, waller, and, had, become, interested, in, what, was, known, as, sympathetic, action, where, inflammation, appeared, in, a, different, area, from, the, source, of, irritation, this, led, him, to, study, pfl, ger, s, 1857, paper, titled, about, the, inhibitory, nervous, system, for, the, peristaltic, movements, of, the, intestines, proposed, that, the, splanchnic, nerves, instead, of, exciting, the, intestine, muscle, layer, that, they, are, connected, to, inhibit, their, movement, the, german, physiologist, eduard, weber, made, the, same, claim, pfl, ger, had, named, these, inhibitory, nerves, hemmungs, nervensystem, a, name, that, syme, at, lister, s, request, thought, they, should, be, translated, as, inhibitory, nervous, system, lister, dismissed, pfl, ger, s, idea, of, inhibitory, nerves, as, not, only, implausible, but, not, supported, by, observation, as, a, mild, stimulus, caused, increased, muscle, activity, which, changed, to, a, decreased, muscle, activity, as, the, incoming, stimulus, became, stronger, lister, believed, that, it, was, questionable, whether, the, motions, of, the, heart, or, the, intestines, are, ever, checked, by, the, spinal, system, except, for, very, brief, periods, lister, conducted, a, series, of, experiments, using, mechanical, irritation, and, galvanism, to, stimulate, the, nerves, and, spinal, cord, in, rabbits, and, frogs, and, due, to, rabbits, active, gut, movement, he, considered, them, ideal, for, the, experiment, to, ensure, their, gut, reflexes, were, not, impaired, the, rabbits, were, not, anaesthetised, lister, conducted, three, experiments, in, the, first, experiment, an, incision, was, made, in, the, rabbit, s, side, and, a, section, of, intestine, was, pulled, through, the, skin, lister, then, connected, a, magnetic, coil, battery, to, the, splanchnic, nerves, in, the, spinal, cord, when, the, current, was, applied, the, gut, completely, relaxed, but, when, the, current, was, applied, locally, a, small, localised, contraction, occurred, that, did, not, spread, to, the, bowel, lister, stated, that, this, observation, is, of, fundamental, importance, since, it, proves, that, the, inhibitory, influence, does, not, operate, directly, upon, the, muscular, tissue, but, upon, the, nervous, apparatus, by, which, its, contractions, are, under, ordinary, circumstances, elicited, in, the, second, experiment, lister, examined, the, reaction, in, a, section, of, the, bowel, when, he, restricted, the, blood, supply, by, tying, the, vessels, and, found, that, there, was, an, increase, in, peristalsis, when, he, applied, current, the, gut, relaxed, he, concluded, that, activity, in, the, gut, was, under, the, control, of, bowel, wall, nerves, and, had, been, stimulated, due, to, loss, of, blood, in, the, third, experiment, he, removed, the, nerves, from, a, section, of, the, bowel, while, ensuring, to, maintain, a, good, blood, supply, this, time, stimulation, of, the, section, had, no, effect, except, when, the, section, would, spontaneously, contract, during, the, histological, study, of, the, bowel, wall, lister, discovered, a, plexus, of, neurons, the, myenteric, plexus, that, confirmed, the, observations, made, by, georg, meissner, in, 1857, lister, concluded, it, appears, that, the, intestines, possess, an, intrinsic, ganglionic, apparatus, which, is, in, all, cases, essential, to, the, peristaltic, movements, and, while, capable, of, independent, action, is, liable, to, be, stimulated, or, checked, by, other, parts, of, the, nervous, system, although, lister, did, not, believe, in, the, inhibitory, system, he, did, conclude, that, extrinsic, nerves, controlled, the, intestinal, motor, function, indirectly, through, their, effect, on, the, plexus, it, was, not, until, 1964, that, this, was, proven, by, karl, axel, norberg, lister, s, third, paper, on, coagulation, was, a, short, article, in, the, form, of, a, communication, consisting, of, five, pages, that, were, read, before, the, medico, chirugical, society, of, edinburgh, on, 16, november, 1859, in, the, paper, lister, found, that, the, coagulation, of, blood, was, not, solely, dependent, on, the, presence, of, ammonia, but, may, also, be, influenced, by, other, factors, in, a, demonstration, before, the, society, lister, had, a, sample, of, horse, s, blood, that, had, been, shed, twenty, nine, hours, earlier, and, added, acetic, acid, to, it, the, blood, remained, fluid, despite, being, acidified, but, it, eventually, coagulated, after, being, left, to, stand, for, 15, minutes, lister, demonstrated, that, the, ammonia, theory, was, incorrect, as, the, coagulation, of, the, blood, was, not, dependent, on, the, presence, of, ammonia, he, concluded, that, other, factors, may, influence, blood, coagulation, in, addition, to, or, instead, of, ammonia, and, that, the, ammonia, theory, was, fallacious, on, 1, august, 1859, lister, wrote, to, his, father, to, inform, him, of, the, ill, health, of, james, adair, lawrie, regius, professor, of, surgery, at, the, university, of, glasgow, believing, he, was, close, to, death, the, anatomist, allen, thomson, had, written, to, syme, to, inform, him, of, lawrie, s, condition, and, that, it, was, his, opinion, that, lister, was, the, most, suitable, person, for, the, position, lister, stated, that, syme, believed, he, should, become, a, candidate, for, the, position, he, went, on, to, discuss, the, merits, of, the, post, a, higher, salary, being, able, to, undertake, more, surgery, and, being, able, to, create, a, bigger, private, practice, lawrie, died, on, 23, november, 1859, in, the, following, month, lister, received, a, private, communication, although, baseless, that, confirmed, he, had, received, the, appointment, however, it, was, clear, the, matter, was, not, settled, when, a, letter, appeared, in, the, glasgow, herald, on, 18, january, 1860, that, discussed, a, rumour, that, the, decision, had, been, handed, over, to, the, lord, advocate, and, officials, in, edinburgh, the, letter, annoyed, the, members, of, the, governing, body, of, glasgow, university, the, senatus, academicus, the, matter, was, referred, to, the, vice, chancellor, thomas, barclay, who, tipped, the, decision, in, favour, of, lister, on, 28, january, 1860, lister, s, appointment, was, confirmed, to, be, formally, inducted, into, the, academic, staff, lister, had, to, deliver, a, latin, oration, before, the, senatus, academicus, in, a, letter, to, his, father, he, described, how, surprised, he, was, when, a, letter, arrived, from, allen, thomson, informing, him, that, the, thesis, had, to, be, presented, the, next, day, on, 9, march, lister, unable, to, start, the, paper, until, 2, am, the, next, night, had, only, prepared, around, two, thirds, of, it, when, he, arrived, in, glasgow, the, rest, was, written, at, thomson, s, house, in, the, letter, he, described, the, dread, he, felt, being, admitted, into, the, room, prior, to, presenting, the, oration, after, the, thesis, was, read, and, lister, was, inducted, to, the, senate, he, signed, a, statement, not, to, act, contrary, to, the, wishes, of, the, church, of, scotland, while, the, contents, of, his, thesis, have, been, lost, the, title, is, known, de, arte, chirurgica, recte, erudienda, on, the, proper, way, of, teaching, the, art, of, surgery, in, early, may, 1860, the, couple, made, the, journey, to, glasgow, to, move, into, their, new, house, at, 17, woodside, place, at, the, time, on, the, western, edge, of, the, city, in, 1860, university, life, in, glasgow, was, lived, in, the, grimy, quadrangles, of, the, small, college, on, glasgow, high, street, a, mile, east, of, the, city, centre, next, to, glasgow, royal, infirmary, gri, and, the, cathedral, and, surrounded, by, the, most, squalid, part, of, the, old, medieval, city, the, scottish, poet, and, novelist, andrew, lang, wrote, of, his, student, days, at, the, college, that, while, coleridge, could, smell, 75, different, stenches, during, his, student, days, in, cologne, lang, counted, more, the, city, was, so, polluted, the, grass, did, not, grow, the, position, of, professor, of, surgery, at, glasgow, was, peculiar, as, it, did, not, carry, with, it, an, appointment, as, surgeon, to, the, royal, infirmary, as, the, university, was, separate, from, the, hospital, the, allotment, of, surgical, wards, to, the, care, of, the, professor, of, surgery, depended, upon, the, goodwill, of, the, directors, of, the, infirmary, his, predecessor, lawrie, never, held, any, hospital, appointments, at, all, having, no, patients, to, care, for, lister, immediately, began, a, summer, lecture, course, he, discovered, that, college, classrooms, were, considered, too, small, and, had, low, ceilings, for, the, number, of, students, which, made, them, unpleasant, to, be, in, when, filled, to, overcrowding, before, his, first, lecture, the, couple, cleaned, and, painted, the, dingy, lecture, room, assigned, to, them, at, their, own, expense, he, inherited, a, large, class, of, students, from, his, predecessor, that, grew, rapidly, after, his, first, session, he, wrote, favourably, of, glasgow, the, facilities, i, have, here, for, prosecuting, this, course, as, compared, to, the, difficulties, i, laboured, under, in, edinburgh, are, quite, delightful, museums, abundant, material, and, a, good, library, all, at, my, disposal, and, my, colleague, allen, thompson, co, operating, in, the, kindest, and, most, valuable, manner, in, august, 1860, lister, was, visited, by, his, parents, who, took, a, saloon, carriage, on, the, great, northern, railway, in, september, 1860, marcus, beck, came, to, live, with, the, listers, and, their, two, servants, while, he, studied, medicine, at, the, university, in, the, closing, weeks, of, the, summer, the, listers, along, with, beck, lucy, syme, and, ramsay, went, on, a, short, holiday, to, balloch, loch, lomond, while, the, group, was, visiting, tarbet, argyll, the, men, rowed, across, the, loch, and, ascended, ben, lomond, in, august, 1860, lister, had, been, rejected, for, a, post, at, the, royal, infirmary, by, david, smith, a, shoemaker, who, was, the, chairman, of, the, hospital, board, when, lister, put, his, case, to, smith, explaining, the, need, for, anatomical, demonstrations, so, the, students, could, understand, the, practice, of, surgery, smith, stated, his, belief, that, the, infirmary, was, a, curative, institution, not, an, educational, one, the, rejection, both, annoyed, and, surprised, lister, as, he, had, been, promised, by, thomson, that, the, position, was, assured, indeed, he, had, informed, his, father, of, the, fact, that, the, post, was, guaranteed, in, his, letter, to, his, father, in, november, 1860, the, winter, lecture, course, began, in, total, 182, students, registered, for, the, lectures, and, according, to, godlee, it, was, likely, the, largest, class, of, systematic, surgery, in, great, britain, if, not, in, europe, the, class, consisting, of, mostly, 4th, year, students, with, some, 3rd, and, 2nd, year, students, was, so, enthused, that, they, decided, to, make, lister, the, honorary, president, of, their, medical, society, when, the, time, approached, for, the, election, to, the, surgeoncy, in, 1861, 161, students, signed, a, petition, on, parchment, supporting, his, claim, for, election, lister, was, not, elected, until, 5, august, 1861, in, what, was, described, by, beck, as, a, troublesome, canvas, lister, was, put, in, charge, of, wards, xxiv, 24, and, xxv, 25, in, october, 1861, it, wasn, t, until, november, 1861, that, he, performed, his, first, public, operation, soon, after, lister, arrived, at, the, gri, a, new, surgical, block, was, built, and, it, was, here, that, he, conducted, many, of, his, trials, of, antisepsis, during, this, period, between, the, end, of, his, winter, lecture, course, and, his, appointment, lister, s, correspondence, contained, little, of, scientific, interest, finally, a, letter, to, his, father, dated, 2, august, 1861, explained, the, reason, he, had, halted, his, experiments, on, coagulation, to, work, on, writing, two, chapters, amputation, and, on, sthetics, on, anaesthetics, for, the, medical, reference, work, system, of, surgery, by, timothy, holmes, published, in, four, volumes, in, 1862, chloroform, was, lister, s, preferred, anaesthetic, he, wrote, three, papers, for, holmes, in, 1861, 1870, and, 1882, chapters, the, science, of, anaesthesia, was, in, its, infancy, when, lister, had, first, recommended, chloroform, to, syme, in, 1855, and, had, continued, to, use, it, until, the, 1880s, his, sister, isabella, sophie, had, first, described, its, use, to, him, in, 1848, when, she, had, a, tooth, pulled, he, had, further, clinical, experience, using, it, on, three, patients, who, had, tumours, of, the, jaw, without, complications, in, 1854, he, had, classed, it, along, with, alcohol, and, opium, as, a, specific, irritant, in, on, the, early, stages, of, imflammation, lister, preferred, it, as, it, was, safer, to, use, in, artificial, light, than, ether, it, protected, the, heart, and, blood, vessels, and, as, lister, believed, gave, the, patient, mental, tranquility, as, it, was, the, safest, in, the, 1871, edition, he, reported, there, had, been, no, deaths, in, edinburgh, or, glasgow, infirmaries, from, chloroform, during, the, period, between, 1861, and, 1870, lister, described, how, his, assistant, applied, the, chloroform, onto, a, simple, handkerchief, as, a, mask, while, he, watched, the, patient, s, breathing, in, 1870, he, updated, the, chapter, to, state, that, he, felt, apprehension, about, using, chloroform, on, the, aged, and, infirm, in, the, same, edition, he, recommended, nitrous, oxide, for, tooth, extraction, and, the, use, of, ether, to, avoid, vomiting, after, abdominal, surgery, in, the, winter, of, 1873, the, english, medical, journals, reported, that, sulphuric, ether, should, be, used, instead, but, watson, cheyne, stated, there, had, been, no, deaths, from, chloroform, during, the, winter, of, 1873, in, 1880, the, british, medical, association, recommended, the, synthetic, gas, ethidene, dichloride, for, clinical, trials, on, 14, november, 1881, paul, bert, published, the, dose, response, curve, of, chloroform, but, lister, believed, that, smaller, doses, would, be, sufficient, to, anaesthetize, the, patient, starting, in, april, 1882, lister, first, conducted, clinical, research, using, ether, and, from, july, to, november, lab, experiments, on, chaffinches, and, then, on, himself, and, agnes, to, determine, the, correct, dose, the, 1882, chapter, continued, to, recommend, chloroform, the, chapter, on, amputation, was, much, more, technical, than, the, anaesthesia, chapter, for, example, describing, the, ways, of, cutting, the, skin, to, produce, flaps, to, close, over, the, wound, in, the, first, edition, lister, examined, the, history, of, amputation, from, hippocrates, to, thomas, pridgin, teale, william, hey, fran, ois, chopart, nikolay, pirogov, and, dominique, jean, larrey, and, the, discovery, of, the, tourniquet, by, etienne, morel, in, the, first, edition, lister, devoted, 7, pages, to, dressings, but, by, the, third, edition, only, a, single, sentence, to, recommend, a, dry, dressing, as, opposed, to, the, more, common, water, dressing, where, it, was, thought, that, water, excluded, the, air, by, the, third, edition, lister, focused, on, describing, three, innovative, surgical, techniques, the, first, was, a, method, for, amputation, through, the, thigh, that, he, developed, between, 1858, and, 1860, that, was, a, modification, of, henry, douglas, carden, s, technique, for, knee, amputation, the, thigh, amputation, was, through, the, femoral, condyles, in, a, circular, fashion, with, a, small, posterior, flap, that, enabled, a, neat, scar, the, second, technique, was, an, aortic, tourniquet, for, controlling, blood, flow, in, the, abdominal, aorta, the, vessels, of, the, aorta, were, too, tough, to, close, properly, and, ligatures, either, damaged, the, artery, walls, or, caused, premature, death, if, left, in, too, long, the, third, technique, was, a, method, of, bloodless, operation, that, he, created, in, 1863, 1864, by, elevating, a, limb, and, quickly, applying, an, india, rubber, tourniquet, to, stop, limb, circulation, but, it, became, unnecessary, with, the, use, of, the, esmarch, bandage, in, 1859, he, advocated, for, the, use, of, silver, wire, sutures, that, had, been, invented, by, j, marion, sims, but, their, use, fell, out, of, favour, with, the, introduction, of, antiseptics, on, 1, january, 1863, lister, returned, to, the, topic, of, coagulation, when, he, presented, the, croonian, lecture, with, the, title, on, the, coagulation, of, the, blood, although, there, was, little, that, was, new, the, lecture, was, given, at, the, invitation, of, the, royal, society, and, the, royal, college, of, physicians, and, was, held, in, london, lister, opened, the, lecture, by, reconfirming, the, fallacious, nature, of, the, ammonia, theory, instead, proposing, that, shed, blood, coagulates, when, the, solid, and, fluid, elements, of, the, blood, meet, through, experiments, he, confirmed, that, blood, plasma, liquor, sanguinis, alone, lacks, the, ability, to, coagulate, but, gains, it, when, in, contact, with, the, red, blood, cell, lister, suggests, that, living, tissues, possess, similar, properties, in, relation, to, blood, coagulation, he, mentions, the, presence, of, coagulable, fluid, in, the, interstices, of, cellular, tissue, and, describes, instances, of, oedema, liquid, coagulating, after, emission, possibly, due, to, a, slight, admixture, of, red, blood, cells, lister, highlighted, the, tendency, of, inflamed, tissues, to, induce, coagulation, in, their, vicinity, suggesting, that, inflamed, tissues, temporarily, lose, their, vital, properties, and, behave, like, ordinary, solids, leading, to, coagulation, he, provided, examples, of, inflamed, arteries, and, veins, exhibiting, coagulation, on, their, interior, similar, to, artificially, deprived, vessels, lister, then, describes, the, difference, between, inflammatory, exudations, and, oedema, effusions, with, inflamed, tissues, inducing, coagulation, while, oedema, effusions, remain, fluid, the, increased, pressure, caused, by, accumulated, red, blood, cells, in, inflamed, capillaries, is, hypothesised, to, contribute, to, the, loss, of, healthy, condition, in, capillary, walls, leading, to, coagulation, in, the, closing, sections, of, the, lecture, lister, relates, his, previous, microscopic, investigation, published, in, the, philosophical, transactions, which, supported, the, view, that, tissues, can, be, temporarily, deprived, of, vital, power, under, the, action, of, irritants, he, proposes, that, inflammatory, congestion, arises, from, the, adhesiveness, of, red, blood, cells, caused, by, the, interaction, with, irritated, tissues, similar, to, their, behaviour, outside, the, body, when, encountering, ordinary, solids, in, finishing, the, lecture, lister, was, satisfied, that, his, previous, conclusions, on, the, nature, of, inflammation, were, independently, confirmed, through, his, research, into, blood, coagulation, lister, s, most, original, work, that, he, undertook, during, 1863, and, the, beginning, of, 1864, was, the, development, of, a, surgical, technique, for, the, excision, of, caries, from, the, wrist, i, e, the, removal, of, diseased, bone, due, to, tuberculosis, the, procedure, consisted, of, the, removal, of, the, ends, of, the, bones, entering, into, an, articulation, instead, of, amputating, the, whole, limb, and, was, considered, a, recent, development, in, conservative, surgery, several, surgeons, had, attempted, the, procedure, it, was, first, performed, by, german, surgeons, johann, von, dietz, in, 1839, and, johann, ferdinand, heyfelder, in, 1849, followed, by, british, surgeon, william, fergusson, in, 1851, while, the, development, of, techniques, for, excision, of, the, elbow, was, largely, successful, similar, success, for, the, excision, of, the, wrist, was, elusive, so, amputation, was, considered, the, most, appropriate, treatment, even, in, 1860, the, complicated, technique, that, lister, developed, was, the, removal, of, the, tissue, where, the, disease, was, likely, to, occur, but, in, the, process, preserving, those, structures, that, were, used, to, move, the, fingers, and, wrist, the, technique, was, adopted, by, the, profession, and, the, only, complaint, from, surgeons, was, the, length, of, the, operation, at, 90, minutes, lister, waited, almost, a, year, before, publishing, the, paper, in, march, 1865, in, the, lancet, the, paper, presented, 15, case, histories, in, summary, ten, people, were, cured, two, had, hopes, of, achieving, a, cure, two, died, of, causes, independent, of, the, operation, and, lister, considered, one, operation, unsatisfactory, which, was, a, failure, rate, of, 13, in, june, 1864, the, professor, of, systematic, surgery, in, edinburgh, james, miller, died, the, edinburgh, chair, was, considered, the, most, prestigious, within, the, scottish, medical, community, and, came, with, an, annual, stipend, of, between, 700, 800, per, year, syme, and, his, friends, suggested, that, lister, should, apply, as, his, candidature, was, all, but, assured, a, number, of, reasons, have, been, advanced, on, why, lister, applied, in, a, letter, to, his, father, he, said, that, he, saw, glasgow, as, a, stepping, stone, there, were, a, multitude, of, reasons, either, to, stay, or, go, he, was, drawn, to, research, his, friends, were, there, and, he, found, the, routine, nature, in, glasgow, working, in, a, corner, there, was, also, the, fact, that, his, tenure, only, lasted, 10, years, testimonials, from, christison, paget, buchanan, and, syme, followed, the, application, by, the, end, of, june, lister, was, convinced, the, position, was, his, however, the, chair, went, with, james, spence, instead, lister, was, disappointed, and, in, social, settings, tended, to, solipsism, in, conversation, but, by, october, his, father, in, a, letter, said, that, it, was, very, gratifying, to, learn, thy, complete, reconcilement, to, remaining, at, glasgow, before, he, received, the, disappointing, news, lister, had, been, called, back, to, upton, as, his, mother, isabella, was, on, her, deathbed, she, died, on, 3, september, 1864, his, father, was, now, living, alone, at, upton, as, the, only, daughter, left, at, home, had, married, in, 1858, communication, with, his, children, became, of, paramount, importance, to, joseph, jackson, and, he, started, to, send, lister, a, letter, every, week, stating, in, october, the, thought, that, thou, wilt, look, for, letters, from, thee, weekly, and, the, letters, when, they, come, are, alike, gratifying, to, thy, poor, father, on, 1, november, lister, began, the, winter, lecture, course, that, was, divided, into, two, divisions, those, conditions, common, with, tissue, and, organs, and, those, conditions, of, physiology, his, first, lectures, were, on, blood, then, nerves, then, detailed, special, nerves, which, explained, the, process, of, inflammation, in, introducing, the, subject, he, stated, that, any, injury, that, didn, t, cause, death, would, result, in, inflammation, with, the, familiar, symptoms, of, redness, swelling, and, pain, these, symptoms, were, indicative, of, inflammatory, congestion, that, is, the, suspension, of, vital, energy, which, began, with, red, corpuscles, adhering, together, that, are, caused, by, fibrin, which, itself, was, caused, by, two, substances, in, the, blood, one, in, the, blood, cell, and, one, in, liquor, sanguis, plasma, he, described, two, types, of, inflammation, direct, and, indirect, direct, by, a, noxious, agent, and, indirect, by, sympathy, which, was, an, indication, that, lister, s, frame, of, references, was, wholly, inadequate, he, then, provided, various, examples, and, examined, various, types, for, example, acute, latent, or, chronic, the, following, lectures, were, devoted, to, explaining, how, to, alleviate, the, symptoms, of, inflammation, for, example, raising, a, limb, to, enable, blood, to, flow, easier, or, reducing, tension, for, example, by, draining, an, abscess, the, remarkable, aspect, of, lister, s, theory, of, inflammation, was, that, while, the, details, of, the, observations, were, correctly, made, the, theoretical, structure, used, to, explain, the, observations, was, completely, wrong, lister, s, error, lay, in, his, belief, that, inflammation, was, a, unitary, disease, a, single, underlying, disease, when, in, effect, it, was, a, range, of, conditions, the, second, division, of, the, lecturers, focused, on, the, heart, blood, vessels, lymphatic, system, bones, joints, and, nerves, lister, and, agnes, spent, christmas, 1864, with, joseph, jackson, at, upton, in, january, lister, attended, a, quite, unusual, operation, by, syme, in, edinburgh, whereby, a, patient, s, tongue, was, removed, a, month, later, lister, received, an, interesting, letter, from, jackson, on, fees, that, indicated, lister, s, growing, private, practice, that, he, began, in, 1861, his, practice, was, unusual, as, it, was, solely, dedicated, to, surgery, during, a, period, when, operations, either, took, place, at, the, doctor, s, surgery, or, at, the, patient, s, home, in, march, 1865, lister, along, with, his, colleagues, became, involved, in, the, case, of, the, murderer, edward, william, pritchard, who, was, employed, as, a, doctor, in, glasgow, prichard, had, broken, his, oath, in, a, letter, to, his, father, lister, expressed, his, sincere, hope, that, he, would, be, hung, at, the, end, of, 1864, or, during, the, spring, of, 1865, sources, vary, while, walking, home, with, thomas, anderson, the, chemistry, professor, at, glasgow, and, discussing, putrefaction, anderson, drew, lister, s, attention, to, the, latest, research, of, the, french, chemist, louis, pasteur, who, had, discovered, living, things, that, caused, fermentation, and, putrefaction, at, that, time, lister, was, not, a, wide, reader, of, continental, literature, began, reading, the, weekly, journal, comptes, rendus, hebdomadaires, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, through, the, years, 1860, 1863, where, pasteur, discussed, fermentation, and, putrefaction, the, two, papers, that, anderson, recommended, to, lister, was, sur, les, corpuscules, organis, s, qui, existent, dans, l, atmosph, re, examen, de, la, doctrine, des, g, n, rations, spontan, es, 1861, on, the, organized, particles, that, exist, in, the, atmosphere, examination, of, the, doctrine, of, spontaneous, generations, in, this, paper, pasteur, disproved, the, theory, of, spontaneous, generation, by, proving, the, hypothesis, that, life, in, boiled, infusions, arose, from, spores, he, also, proved, that, particles, in, the, air, could, be, cultivated, and, if, they, were, introduced, from, the, air, into, a, sterile, liquid, they, would, reappear, and, multiply, in, the, liquid, the, second, paper, that, lister, read, that, day, was, pasteur, s, magnum, opus, titled, examen, du, r, le, attribu, au, gaz, oxyg, ne, atmosph, rique, dans, la, destruction, des, mati, res, animales, et, v, g, tales, apr, s, la, mort, 1863, examination, of, the, role, attributed, to, atmospheric, oxygen, gas, in, the, destruction, of, animal, and, plant, matter, after, death, published, on, 29, june, 1863, the, paper, concluded, that, fermentation, putrefaction, and, slow, combustion, destroyed, organic, matter, and, these, were, necessary, processes, for, life, to, exist, pasteur, learned, that, slow, combustion, was, related, to, the, anaerobic, conditions, that, were, present, if, microorganisms, were, present, several, other, papers, would, directly, influence, lister, s, work, on, microorganisms, the, third, paper, was, the, m, moire, sur, la, fermentation, appel, e, lactique, extrait, par, l, auteur, memoir, on, the, so, called, lactic, acid, fermentation, extracted, by, the, author, that, was, published, in, 1857, and, describes, the, discovery, of, the, microbe, that, is, responsible, for, the, process, of, fermentation, in, beer, yeast, the, fourth, paper, was, the, memoire, sur, la, fermentation, alcoolique, memoir, on, alcoholic, fermentation, that, was, published, in, annales, de, chimie, et, de, physique, in, 1860, pasteur, described, the, living, beings, microorganisms, in, yeast, saccharomyces, cerevisiae, that, were, responsible, for, the, effervescent, change, that, led, to, fermentation, the, last, paper, by, pasteur, was, the, animalcules, infusoires, vivant, sans, gaz, oxyg, ne, libre, et, d, terminant, des, fermentations, animal, infusoria, living, in, the, absence, of, free, oxygen, and, their, fermentations, the, paper, that, was, presented, in, 1861, was, seminal, in, enabling, lister, to, understand, the, nature, of, sepsis, where, the, bodies, response, to, infections, leads, to, injury, in, the, tissue, and, organs, pasteur, s, research, led, him, to, believe, the, ferment, that, produced, butyric, acid, was, a, microbe, that, lived, in, the, absence, of, oxygen, the, last, paper, that, lister, found, important, was, recherches, sur, la, putr, faction, research, on, putrefaction, that, concluded, stating, that, putrefecation, is, determined, by, living, ferments, lister, was, not, the, only, surgeon, who, was, interested, in, pasteur, s, research, thomas, spencer, wells, who, was, surgeon, to, queen, victoria, had, emphasised, the, significance, of, pasteur, s, work, at, a, meeting, of, the, british, medical, association, in, 1864, stating, applying, the, knowledge, for, which, we, are, indebted, to, pasteur, of, the, presence, in, the, atmosphere, of, organic, germs, it, is, easy, to, understand, that, some, germs, find, their, most, appropriate, nutriment, in, the, secretions, from, wounds, or, in, pus, and, that, they, so, modify, it, as, to, convert, it, into, a, poison, when, absorbed, however, wells, did, not, have, an, experiment, to, demonstrate, the, germ, theory, and, was, unable, to, develop, the, techniques, to, put, it, into, practice, the, discovery, of, pasteur, s, work, was, serendipitous, as, he, read, them, during, the, time, that, he, was, struggling, to, control, post, surgical, infections, lister, was, one, of, the, few, surgeons, who, was, able, to, accept, pasteur, s, conclusions, without, question, he, accepted, them, as, a, simple, explanation, for, a, problem, he, had, long, experienced, he, was, now, convinced, that, infection, and, suppuration, of, wounds, must, be, due, to, entry, into, the, wound, of, minute, living, airborne, creatures, he, recognised, that, contamination, was, the, vector, for, infection, realising, from, the, first, that, the, surgeon, s, hands, dressings, and, instruments, would, also, be, contaminated, however, pasteur, s, work, could, only, confirm, the, view, which, lister, had, always, expressed, that, contamination, came, from, the, air, lister, did, not, realise, that, it, was, not, the, air, but, the, vast, number, of, different, microbial, life, that, was, responsible, as, lister, s, work, at, that, time, was, derived, directly, from, pasteur, s, work, lister, probably, thought, that, infection, of, the, wound, was, due, to, a, single, organism, he, had, no, conception, nor, indeed, did, anybody, else, of, the, vast, number, of, types, of, germs, that, existed, in, nature, the, realisation, that, occurred, after, reading, the, papers, spurred, him, to, determine, how, the, hands, dressings, and, instruments, he, used, could, be, rid, of, these, ubiquitous, organisms, and, how, the, wound, could, be, cleared, of, them, pasteur, suggested, three, methods, to, eliminate, microorganisms, filtration, exposure, to, heat, or, exposure, to, chemical, solutions, lister, was, particularly, interested, in, the, efficacy, of, filtration, and, repeated, many, of, pasteur, s, experiments, in, modified, form, for, instruction, in, his, class, but, eventually, excluded, the, first, two, techniques, as, they, were, not, applicable, for, the, treatment, of, wounds, lister, confirmed, pasteur, s, conclusions, with, his, own, experiments, and, decided, to, use, his, findings, to, develop, antiseptic, techniques, for, wounds, in, 1834, friedlieb, ferdinand, runge, discovered, the, germicide, phenol, then, known, as, carbolic, acid, which, he, derived, in, an, impure, form, from, coal, tar, at, that, time, there, was, uncertainty, as, to, the, relationship, of, creosote, a, chemical, that, had, been, used, as, a, preservative, on, the, wood, used, for, railway, sleeper, and, ships, since, it, protected, the, wood, from, rotting, and, carbolic, acid, upon, hearing, that, creosote, had, been, used, for, treating, sewage, in, carlisle, lister, obtained, a, sample, from, anderson, known, as, german, creosote, it, was, a, thick, smelly, tarry, substance, the, history, of, antiseptic, surgery, in, the, years, before, 1847, was, preventing, or, treating, infection, in, accidental, wounds, often, received, in, battle, in, the, 1860s, lister, s, assumptions, about, surgery, and, theory, of, pathology, were, similar, to, those, of, his, contemporaries, in, early, march, 1865, lister, conducted, his, first, experiment, using, the, acid, on, a, patient, whose, wrist, was, being, excised, due, to, caries, although, he, carefully, washed, the, wound, it, became, infected, and, the, experiment, was, a, failure, on, 21, march, 1865, lister, began, his, second, experiment, with, carbolic, acid, on, a, 22, year, old, patient, neil, kelly, who, had, suffered, a, severe, compound, fracture, of, the, leg, his, treatment, consisted, of, cleaning, the, wound, of, all, blood, clots, and, then, applying, the, undiluted, carbolic, acid, by, the, use, of, forceps, across, the, whole, wound, a, piece, of, lint, soaked, in, the, acid, was, then, laid, on, the, leg, overlapping, the, wound, and, fixed, by, an, adhesive, plaster, a, sheet, of, thin, block, tin, or, sheet, lead, that, was, sterilized, by, the, acid, and, placed, to, cover, the, lint, to, prevent, the, antiseptic, from, evaporating, this, was, further, fixed, with, adhesive, plaster, and, packing, was, used, between, the, limb, and, the, splints, for, the, purpose, of, soaking, up, any, blood, or, discharges, a, crust, formed, that, was, not, removed, except, to, apply, a, new, antiseptic, while, the, treatment, possessed, many, of, the, essential, characteristics, of, the, antiseptic, dressings, that, lister, would, subsequently, introduce, it, was, a, failure, and, suppuration, began, to, occur, leading, to, the, death, of, the, patient, lister, blamed, himself, and, noted, that, the, treatment, proved, unsuccessful, in, consequence, as, i, now, believe, of, improper, management, the, essential, part, of, lister, s, operating, treatment, was, not, the, application, of, strong, carbolic, acid, to, the, wound, although, that, required, careful, management, to, ensure, the, wound, was, sterilised, but, the, design, of, the, dressing, in, such, a, manner, to, stop, the, ingress, of, airborne, infection, this, was, often, misunderstood, even, during, the, period, when, he, was, explaining, the, procedure, to, fellow, doctors, whilst, at, glasgow, who, were, celebrating, him, as, humanaties, benefactor, and, it, caused, him, considerable, irritation, and, unhappiness, later, in, life, they, were, confused, by, the, initial, application, of, the, acid, and, the, whole, treatment, that, led, to, the, claim, that, lister, was, advocating, for, the, use, of, carbolic, acid, to, prevent, suppuration, the, disadvantages, of, the, first, primitive, dressing, consisting, of, lint, soaked, in, carbolic, acid, were, soon, apparent, the, german, creosote, was, also, far, from, ideal, as, it, was, irritating, to, the, skin, causing, ulceration, and, then, suppuration, that, occasionally, resulted, in, tissue, necrosis, it, was, also, almost, insoluble, in, water, lister, began, to, look, for, another, source, of, phenol, lister, discovered, that, frederick, crace, calvert, an, honorary, chemistry, professor, from, the, royal, manchester, institution, was, manufacturing, small, quantities, of, phenol, at, a, much, finer, purity, and, managed, to, obtain, some, the, phenol, was, in, the, form, of, small, white, crystals, which, liquified, at, 80, f, 27, c, and, was, readily, soluble, in, a, ratio, of, 1, 20, parts, of, water, and, to, any, extent, soluble, in, oil, the, watery, solution, could, be, used, in, a, lotion, of, any, strength, and, be, used, for, disinfection, of, wounds, while, the, solution, in, oil, that, served, as, a, reservoir, of, antiseptic, seemed, likely, to, provide, a, suitable, dressing, lister, began, to, experiment, with, the, phenol, and, produced, a, new, dressing, made, of, a, putty, that, consisted, of, carbonate, of, lime, mixed, with, phenol, mixed, with, boiled, linseed, oil, in, a, ratio, of, 1, 4, or, 1, 6, after, the, two, failures, lister, has, no, clear, experimental, design, to, test, to, efficacy, of, carbolic, acid, at, that, point, he, decided, to, only, experiment, on, patients, that, presented, with, compound, fractures, these, are, defined, as, open, wounds, where, the, fractured, bone, breaks, through, the, skin, leading, to, extensive, loss, of, blood, in, 1865, industrial, accidents, often, led, to, the, patient, being, thrown, to, the, ground, leading, to, dirt, entering, the, wound, that, risked, deep, infection, by, the, time, the, patient, saw, the, surgeon, several, hours, later, suppuration, had, invariably, had, set, in, in, 1865, amputation, was, the, standard, treatment, for, compound, fractures, lister, reasoned, that, he, could, experiment, on, the, patient, and, if, the, treatment, failed, perform, the, amputation, to, remove, the, limb, and, save, the, patients, life, he, believed, this, experimental, model, was, both, ethically, and, medically, ideal, on, 12, august, 1865, lister, achieved, success, for, the, first, time, when, he, used, the, crude, oily, full, strength, carbolic, acid, to, disinfect, a, compound, fracture, he, applied, a, piece, of, lint, dipped, in, carbolic, acid, solution, onto, the, wound, of, an, 11, year, old, boy, james, greenlees, who, had, sustained, a, compound, fracture, after, a, cartwheel, had, passed, over, his, left, leg, after, washing, the, wound, with, carbolic, acid, in, linseed, oil, a, dressing, of, putty, mixed, with, the, acid, was, applied, widely, over, the, wound, and, a, sheet, of, tin, was, then, placed, to, cover, the, wound, to, protect, it, the, putty, was, used, to, ensure, the, acid, wasn, t, washed, out, of, the, wound, by, blood, or, lymph, fluid, the, leg, was, then, put, in, a, splint, and, bandaged, to, hold, the, lot, in, place, after, four, days, he, renewed, the, pad, and, discovered, that, no, infection, had, developed, it, was, again, dressed, and, left, for, 5, days, when, the, second, dressing, was, removed, he, found, the, skin, around, the, wound, was, burnt, a, dressing, consisting, of, gauze, soaked, in, a, combination, of, 5, to, 10, acid, and, olive, oil, was, applied, for, a, further, four, days, he, then, applied, a, water, dressing, to, the, wound, until, healing, was, complete, after, slightly, over, six, weeks, lister, was, amazed, to, discover, that, the, boy, s, bones, had, fused, back, together, without, suppuration, confident, that, carbolic, acid, was, the, antiseptic, that, he, had, been, looking, for, lister, began, treating, patient, after, patient, at, the, royal, infimary, in, the, following, months, improving, both, the, wound, dressing, design, and, the, operating, treatment, during, the, summer, the, listers, never, strayed, far, from, glasgow, as, he, was, still, monitoring, greenlees, in, the, same, month, he, treated, two, ulcers, both, sores, were, washed, with, an, acid, in, oil, solution, and, one, was, covered, with, an, oiled, paper, coated, with, spirit, varnish, and, the, second, with, gutta, percha, covered, with, a, water, dressing, in, both, casing, the, dressing, failed, and, they, were, swapped, for, a, water, dressing, that, was, covered, with, cotton, on, 11, september, 1865, the, second, patient, that, lister, treated, with, the, acid, was, patrick, f, a, labourer, with, a, compound, fracture, of, the, thigh, after, the, thigh, was, splinted, the, small, wound, was, dressed, using, lint, dipped, in, carbolic, acid, and, covered, in, oil, paper, after, 16, days, the, patient, had, an, excellent, prognosis, on, the, 22, september, the, listers, decided, to, take, short, holiday, to, upton, and, the, patient, was, left, with, his, house, surgeon, john, macfee, however, the, treatment, failed, and, the, limb, was, amputated, after, gangrene, developed, in, the, wound, when, he, wrote, up, his, seminal, paper, lister, considered, the, wound, sizes, to, be, too, small, to, effectively, test, the, efficacy, of, the, acid, but, he, was, happy, with, the, outcome, in, christmas, 1865, the, lister, joined, the, symes, in, edinburgh, it, was, eight, months, before, lister, treated, another, compound, fracture, in, 22, january, 1866, he, treated, john, austin, a, shipwreck, survivor, with, a, wound, in, the, leg, that, had, developed, into, a, ulcer, the, wound, was, washed, in, 20, 1, oil, to, acid, solution, and, dressed, with, a, lint, bandage, dipped, in, the, solution, and, covered, with, plaster, of, paris, on, 19, may, 1866, the, first, patient, to, use, the, improved, method, was, presented, at, lister, s, accident, ward, with, a, compound, fracture, with, extensive, swelling, and, bruising, the, patient, was, john, hainy, a, 21, year, old, casting, moulder, in, an, iron, foundry, who, was, supervising, a, crane, when, a, chain, broke, and, a, metal, box, containing, a, sand, mould, weighing, 12, hundredweight, or, 1, 344, pounds, 609, 6, kg, fell, from, a, height, of, four, feet, and, landed, obliquely, on, his, left, leg, both, of, the, leg, bones, were, broken, and, a, wound, measuring, 1, 5, by, 0, 75, inches, 38, by, 19, mm, had, bled, profusely, into, the, muscles, and, tissue, of, the, leg, a, secondary, complication, had, occurred, when, air, bubbles, had, mixed, with, the, blood, when, the, man, was, moved, to, the, hospital, in, such, a, case, the, normal, treatment, would, be, amputation, but, lister, decided, to, treat, the, wound, with, phenol, he, squeezed, the, leg, to, remove, as, much, air, and, blood, as, possible, then, he, placed, a, piece, of, lint, soaked, in, carbolic, acid, on, the, wound, covered, by, tin, foil, a, bloody, crust, formed, over, the, wound, consisting, of, a, scab, that, was, free, of, bacteria, lister, saw, for, the, first, time, how, the, scab, was, gradually, converted, into, living, tissue, even, when, new, carbolic, acid, was, being, applied, something, that, was, entirely, new, unfortunately, hainy, developed, bed, sores, that, became, gangrenous, and, these, were, treated, with, nitric, acid, to, remove, the, necrotic, flesh, and, carbolic, acid, to, sterilize, the, wound, hainy, survived, the, injury, on, 27, may, lister, wrote, to, his, father, expressing, intense, satisfaction, stating, i, tried, the, application, of, carbolic, acid, to, the, wound, to, prevent, decomposition, of, the, blood, and, to, prevent, the, fearful, mischief, of, suppuration, it, is, now, eight, days, since, the, accident, and, patient, has, been, going, exactly, as, though, the, fracture, were, a, simple, one, two, weeks, later, another, letter, followed, reporting, the, great, swelling, has, almost, entirely, subsided, and, the, limb, is, becoming, firm, on, 7, august, 1866, hainy, was, released, from, hospital, lister, continued, to, refine, the, dressing, and, perfect, the, antiseptic, treatment, he, would, often, spend, long, nights, experimenting, in, his, home, laboratory, he, searched, for, a, material, that, could, be, placed, over, the, wound, and, under, the, carbolic, acid, that, would, serve, to, protect, the, wound, from, the, irritating, effects, of, the, acid, and, stop, the, ingress, of, microbes, but, enable, bodily, secretions, to, escape, he, eventually, settled, on, the, use, of, oiled, silk, that, was, sold, under, the, green, oiled, silk, protective, brand, the, silk, surface, was, painted, with, one, part, dextrin, two, parts, of, powdered, starch, and, 16, parts, of, watery, acid, in, a, 20, 1, water, acid, solution, to, ensure, a, thorough, wetting, the, sterile, silk, dressing, was, an, effective, barrier, between, the, acid, and, the, tissue, he, described, the, new, treatment, as, an, antiseptic, to, exclude, putrefaction, with, a, protective, to, exclude, the, atmosphere, will, by, their, joint, action, keep, the, wound, from, abnormal, stimulus, in, the, early, months, of, 1867, lister, began, writing, up, the, compound, fracture, case, histories, of, his, experiments, with, carbolic, acid, into, a, new, paper, in, the, first, paper, to, describe, his, new, technique, of, antiseptics, the, paper, titled, on, a, new, method, of, treating, compound, fracture, abscess, etc, with, observations, on, the, conditions, of, suppuration, was, published, in, the, lancet, in, 5, instalments, between, march, and, july, 1867, with, the, first, instalment, appearing, on, the, 10, march, 1867, the, paper, is, divided, into, two, sections, the, main, portion, dealing, with, compound, fractures, and, a, short, note, on, the, treatment, of, abscesses, lister, s, theory, of, inflammation, was, used, to, provide, the, conceptual, structure, of, the, article, he, stated, that, inflammation, appeared, immediately, after, a, person, was, wounded, and, it, was, both, necessary, and, dangerous, it, was, essentially, a, precursor, to, healing, but, at, the, same, time, the, fluids, which, flowed, into, the, wound, were, akin, to, dead, tissue, through, the, action, of, inflammation, putrefaction, could, occur, lister, then, described, tissue, healing, by, granulation, which, he, believed, was, the, likely, outcome, in, wounds, in, compound, fractures, lister, believed, that, cells, in, granulated, tissue, were, remarkably, active, and, since, they, were, alive, were, immune, to, putrefaction, they, were, also, immune, to, secondary, inflammation, as, they, lacked, sensory, nerves, lister, then, claimed, that, airborne, putrefaction, a, danger, that, was, underrated, was, proven, by, the, scabs, which, appeared, to, protect, small, wounds, from, decomposition, during, wound, healing, lister, then, explained, how, putrefaction, affected, tissue, that, often, it, appeared, in, less, than, 24, hours, and, had, an, associated, smell, he, described, the, source, of, putrefaction, and, described, how, the, raw, surface, of, the, wound, could, putrify, before, the, granulations, formed, or, the, liquids, on, the, surface, of, the, granulations, putrified, the, liquids, that, were, produced, were, extremely, acrid, and, acted, on, the, sensory, nerves, to, initiate, indirect, inflammation, and, fever, this, in, turn, led, to, an, increase, in, cell, turnover, and, resultant, cellular, death, increasing, the, quantity, of, putrescent, material, in, the, wound, when, indirect, putrefaction, occurred, sloughs, were, produced, that, resulted, in, suppuration, in, the, next, section, of, the, paper, lister, made, his, most, famous, declaration, namely, that, the, decomposition, of, organic, tissue, was, not, caused, by, the, gaseous, components, in, the, atmosphere, but, minute, particles, suspended, in, which, are, the, germs, of, various, low, forms, of, life, long, since, revealed, by, the, microscope, and, regarded, as, merely, accidental, concomitants, of, putrescence, and, had, been, identified, by, pasteur, as, the, essential, cause, of, putrefaction, he, described, how, the, germs, worked, in, the, same, manner, as, yeast, that, converts, sugar, to, alcohol, lister, s, germs, were, scavengers, who, lived, on, dead, tissue, and, he, didn, t, see, them, as, being, parasitic, on, living, tissue, in, that, respect, lister, s, paper, is, open, to, many, interpretations, but, in, the, context, of, wounds, he, believed, that, living, tissue, could, resist, germs, he, never, made, the, distinction, as, to, whether, germs, were, living, beings, for, example, in, erysipelas, that, entered, the, body, or, were, a, chemical, agent, in, the, rest, of, the, paper, lister, describes, using, carbolic, acid, along, with, a, description, of, how, the, acid, forms, a, dense, crust, that, protects, the, wound, from, the, ingress, of, germs, he, then, describes, the, outcome, of, his, experiments, on, 11, patients, healing, by, granulation, occurred, in, all, cases, except, 7, 10, 11, which, didn, t, suppurate, cases, 1, and, 9, did, suppurate, lister, didn, t, regard, pus, as, significant, as, it, was, not, associated, with, inflammation, or, change, in, putrefaction, in, essence, he, had, attained, healing, by, granulation, without, inflammation, in, compound, fracture, cases, he, believed, that, the, elimination, of, suppuration, wasn, t, a, desirable, therapeutic, outcome, as, a, small, amount, of, suppuration, on, a, healthy, granulation, wasn, t, a, cause, for, alarm, in, july, 1867, lister, discovered, that, his, sister, isabella, pim, had, breast, cancer, at, the, time, pim, had, visited, paget, and, syme, to, seek, treatment, but, had, such, an, extensive, carcinoma, that, both, surgeons, had, advised, against, operating, lister, made, the, difficult, decision, to, perform, a, radical, mastectomy, he, decided, to, consult, syme, in, edinburgh, and, rehearsed, the, operation, on, a, dead, body, the, procedure, took, place, in, his, own, house, the, recovery, went, smoothly, and, although, there, was, some, suppuration, in, the, wound, lister, s, use, of, antiseptics, prevented, putrefaction, from, occurring, the, next, day, he, wrote, to, his, father, i, may, say, the, operation, was, done, at, least, as, well, as, if, she, was, not, my, sister, but, i, do, not, wish, to, do, such, a, thing, again, within, a, few, days, of, the, publishing, of, the, last, part, of, the, previous, paper, syme, asked, lister, to, attend, the, british, medical, association, meeting, in, dublin, on, 9, august, 1867, lister, had, some, difficulty, preparing, a, new, paper, the, seminal, on, the, antiseptic, principle, in, the, practice, of, surgery, which, was, lister, s, second, paper, on, antiseptic, surgery, it, was, later, published, in, the, british, medical, journal, on, 21, september, 1867, lister, claimed, that, on, the, basis, of, experiments, on, inflammation, the, essential, cause, of, suppuration, in, wounds, was, decomposition, several, aspects, of, this, claim, needs, to, be, examined, firstly, it, was, specific, to, wounds, only, as, lister, had, other, views, about, suppuration, in, other, sites, on, the, body, secondly, he, stipulated, that, decomposition, was, the, essential, cause, of, suppuration, i, e, it, wasn, t, the, only, cause, thirdly, that, decomposition, was, the, cause, of, pus, appearing, in, wounds, lister, s, pronouncement, is, best, described, as, that, he, had, discovered, the, only, important, cause, of, suppuration, in, inflamed, wounds, is, decomposition, lister, was, specifically, referring, to, the, pathology, of, pus, formation, in, inflamed, tissue, the, essential, cause, of, harm, in, the, practice, of, surgery, his, appeal, to, the, reader, in, essence, to, surgical, consensus, to, prevent, the, occurrence, of, suppuration, with, all, its, attendant, risks, was, an, object, manifestly, desirable, refers, to, the, surgeons, dread, of, pus, appearing, in, an, inflamed, wound, lister, then, made, a, wholly, inaccurate, statement, oxygen, which, was, universally, regarded, as, the, agent, by, which, putrefaction, was, effected, when, compared, against, other, sources, lister, introduced, the, work, of, pasteur, claiming, that, decomposition, may, be, avoided, by, using, a, dressing, that, could, destroy, the, minute, organisms, in, the, wound, lister, decided, to, formulate, his, new, surgical, technique, into, a, general, principle, he, termed, it, the, antiseptic, principle, thus, linking, its, nomenclature, with, carbolic, acid, his, principle, was, that, all, the, local, inflammatory, mischief, and, general, febrile, disturbance, which, follow, severe, injuries, are, due, to, the, irritating, and, poisoning, influence, of, decomposing, blood, or, sloughs, he, was, stating, a, great, principle, not, that, decomposition, was, the, cause, of, disease, in, wounds, it, was, the, only, cause, in, the, paper, lister, instructed, surgeons, to, continue, with, the, treatment, even, when, suppuration, appeared, the, reason, for, this, was, the, carbolic, acid, induced, suppuration, but, prevented, decomposition, which, was, contrary, to, normal, surgical, treatment, that, saw, suppuration, as, an, indication, that, something, was, wrong, in, lister, s, case, essentially, that, the, antiseptic, treatment, had, failed, he, noted, that, he, felt, it, necessary, to, affirm, this, position, on, pathological, principles, that, granulation, tissue, had, no, inherent, tendency, to, form, pus, but, only, did, so, when, subjected, to, a, preternatural, tendency, he, explained, that, carbolic, acid, and, decomposing, substances, were, similar, i, e, they, both, caused, suppuration, by, a, chemical, process, but, while, carbolic, acid, only, acted, on, the, surface, of, the, tissue, to, which, it, is, applied, decomposition, is, a, self, propagating, and, self, aggravating, poison, decomposing, tissue, was, a, breeding, ground, for, more, decomposition, that, led, to, putrefaction, in, the, tissue, surrounding, it, lister, was, arguing, that, the, pus, that, formed, by, carbolic, acid, was, acceptable, as, long, as, it, wasn, t, accompanied, with, inflammation, in, this, respect, lister, s, approach, to, normal, or, abnormal, healing, by, granulation, was, the, same, as, the, average, surgeon, of, the, period, simply, that, healthy, healing, didn, t, occur, when, inflammation, was, present, lister, paid, particular, significance, to, putrefaction, in, the, last, part, of, the, paper, stating, that, decomposing, wounds, were, the, cause, of, disease, in, hospitals, which, was, not, an, uncommon, belief, amongst, the, surgical, community, he, described, how, the, two, large, wards, where, he, offered, treatment, were, the, unhealthiest, in, glasgow, and, since, the, application, of, antiseptics, wounds, and, abscesses, no, longer, poison, the, atmosphere, with, putrid, exhalations, leading, to, the, wards, completely, changing, their, character, not, a, single, instance, of, pyaemia, hospital, gangrene, or, erysipelas, had, occurred, in, them, since, the, new, regime, of, antiseptics, had, begun, however, lister, never, explained, how, the, putrid, exhalations, led, to, fever, on, 21, september, 1867, lister, published, again, in, a, new, paper, illustrations, of, the, antiseptic, system, of, treatment, in, surgery, for, the, lancet, which, was, his, third, paper, on, antisepsis, in, the, paper, lister, summarised, his, earlier, claims, and, added, a, significant, new, observation, on, the, agent, of, putrefaction, he, stated, that, the, character, of, the, decomposition, in, a, given, fermentable, substance, is, detetermined, by, the, nature, of, the, organism, that, develops, in, it, he, suggested, that, the, cause, of, fermentation, in, food, was, caused, by, yeasts, and, the, cause, of, putrefaction, were, possible, vibrios, at, the, end, of, the, paper, he, stated, that, on, the, basis, of, his, new, antiseptic, theory, that, a, really, trustworthy, treatment, for, compound, fractures, and, other, severe, contused, wounds, has, been, established, for, the, first, time, so, far, as, i, am, aware, in, the, history, of, surgery, in, october, 1867, lister, decided, to, repeat, pasteur, s, experiment, in, a, modified, form, although, the, experiment, was, originally, devised, by, the, french, chemist, chevreul, this, was, to, support, the, germ, theory, and, to, disprove, the, theory, that, life, arose, from, spontaneous, generation, lister, procured, four, glass, flasks, into, which, he, poured, his, own, urine, lister, then, washed, the, necks, to, remove, any, urine, and, modified, three, of, them, by, extending, and, drawing, their, necks, into, a, narrow, tube, that, was, bent, at, an, acute, angle, the, fourth, had, the, neck, cut, short, and, left, in, a, vertical, position, but, its, diameter, was, reduced, to, a, smaller, size, than, the, others, the, flasks, were, then, boiled, and, when, the, heat, was, withdrawn, air, was, allowed, to, rush, into, the, flask, to, replace, the, condensed, steam, the, flasks, were, then, left, undisturbed, in, the, same, room, the, ends, of, the, necks, open, to, the, air, within, four, days, a, vegetative, mould, appeared, in, the, fourth, flask, while, the, other, three, flasks, remained, clear, lister, would, later, use, the, flasks, in, demonstrations, his, dresser, john, rudd, leeson, described, how, lister, took, the, three, flasks, to, london, sitting, on, their, knees, when, they, moved, into, a, specially, reserved, first, class, cabin, to, ensure, they, survived, the, journey, although, lister, was, so, roundly, honoured, in, later, life, his, ideas, about, the, transmission, of, infection, and, the, use, of, antiseptics, were, widely, criticised, in, his, early, career, on, 24, august, 1867, within, a, month, of, lister, s, publishing, his, first, paper, on, antiseptics, the, editor, of, the, lancet, and, lister, s, nemesis, james, g, wakley, wrote, an, editorial, crediting, pasteur, for, lister, s, research, and, invited, physicians, to, investigate, lister, s, claims, and, report, their, findings, in, journal, on, 21, september, 1867, the, scottish, obstetrician, james, young, simpson, professor, of, medicine, and, midwifery, at, edinburgh, university, and, discoverer, of, chloroform, published, an, editorial, that, attacked, lister, in, the, edinburgh, daily, review, written, under, the, pen, name, chirurgicus, a, common, practice, to, signal, a, personal, attack, simpson, s, motive, for, the, attack, was, due, to, him, trying, to, convince, the, medical, community, of, the, efficacy, of, his, acupressure, technique, that, used, needles, to, halt, arterial, haemorrhage, which, ran, counter, to, listers, use, of, ligatures, the, editorial, letter, was, the, first, of, many, and, began, a, tit, for, tat, argument, that, was, conducted, in, the, press, over, months, and, eventually, led, to, the, acceptance, of, antisepsis, simpson, claimed, that, lister, s, last, article, was, misleading, and, accused, him, of, plagiarising, the, work, of, the, french, doctor, and, pharmacist, jules, lemaire, lemaire, had, described, carbolic, acid, as, a, constituent, of, coal, tar, in, 1860, in, saponinated, coal, tar, and, after, a, long, series, of, investigations, had, followed, up, with, a, book, in, 1863, de, l, acide, ph, nique, de, son, action, sur, les, v, g, taux, les, animaux, les, ferments, les, venins, les, virus, les, miasmes, et, de, ses, applications, l, industrie, l, hygi, ne, aux, sciences, anatomiques, et, la, th, rapeutique, carbolic, acid, its, action, on, plants, animals, ferments, venoms, viruses, miasmas, and, its, applications, to, industry, hygiene, anatomical, sciences, and, therapy, with, the, second, edition, in, 1865, where, he, described, the, antiseptic, power, of, carbolic, acid, while, lemaire, was, a, believer, in, the, germ, theory, and, realised, the, causes, of, putrefaction, he, had, made, no, attempt, to, develop, a, process, to, exclude, them, from, the, wound, on, 5, october, 1867, lister, gave, a, robust, reply, to, simpson, in, a, letter, on, the, use, of, carbolic, acid, in, the, lancet, denying, he, had, heard, of, lemaire, s, work, and, argued, that, work, had, made, little, impact, on, the, medical, profession, lister, went, on, to, defend, his, work, stating, it, was, two, weeks, before, lister, managed, to, read, lemaire, s, book, he, unsuccessfully, searched, glasgow, for, a, copy, before, finally, discovering, one, in, the, library, of, edinburgh, university, on, 19, october, lister, wrote, a, follow, up, letter, to, the, lancet, and, stated, he, didn, t, claim, to, be, the, first, physician, to, use, carbolic, acid, and, that, he, chose, the, acid, due, to, its, strength, as, an, antiseptic, he, also, included, a, letter, of, support, from, a, carlisle, medical, student, phillip, hair, who, had, studied, in, paris, hair, stated, he, had, seen, no, treatments, there, that, were, as, effective, as, lister, s, lister, s, response, angered, simpson, and, two, weeks, later, on, 2, november, 1867, published, a, bitter, reply, carbolic, acid, and, its, compounds, in, surgery, in, the, lancet, under, his, own, name, simpson, reiterated, his, previous, claims, about, lemaire, s, and, others, prior, use, of, the, acid, amongst, them, was, james, spence, who, had, used, the, acid, to, wash, amputations, but, abandoned, its, use, he, cited, a, report, by, sampson, gamgee, who, visited, paris, and, reported, that, surgeons, were, using, a, solution, of, 100, 1, of, water, to, acid, while, lister, recommended, 40, 1, in, the, last, part, of, the, letter, simpson, exposed, his, true, motives, when, he, compared, his, preferred, technique, of, acupressure, against, lister, s, use, of, ligatures, he, used, the, work, of, william, pirrie, professor, of, surgery, at, aberdeen, university, who, had, used, acupressure, to, stop, pus, formation, during, breast, cancer, operations, to, illustrate, his, point, that, there, had, been, no, deaths, from, pyaemia, at, the, hospital, compared, to, the, many, death, in, glasgow, and, edinburgh, simpson, was, acutely, embarrassed, when, pirrie, replied, a, week, later, in, the, lancet, in, a, small, article, on, the, use, of, carbolic, acid, in, burns, recommending, its, use, for, burn, injuries, and, believing, it, proved, effective, in, other, treatments, lister, replied, with, a, short, note, the, 9, november, to, ask, the, reader, to, to, judge, for, themselves, how, far, the, present, attack, admits, of, justification, promising, to, publish, additional, articles, on, his, antiseptic, technique, the, first, experimentalist, surgeon, to, question, the, validity, of, airborne, microorganisms, was, the, surgeon, and, professor, of, medicine, at, edinburgh, john, hughes, bennett, in, january, 1868, in, a, lecture, for, the, edinburgh, medical, journal, bennett, advanced, the, atmospheric, germ, theory, that, was, in, agreement, with, the, theories, of, f, lix, archim, de, pouchet, professor, of, natural, history, at, the, university, of, rouen, who, believed, in, spontaneous, generation, of, life, bennet, described, his, own, theory, of, molecular, degeneration, to, explain, how, microorganisms, transformed, old, tissue, into, new, tissue, by, the, action, of, molecules, bennett, taught, that, molecules, instead, of, cells, were, the, foundational, building, blocks, of, tissue, and, that, microorganisms, could, be, spontaneously, created, from, different, combinations, of, molecules, in, his, view, each, molecule, had, a, specific, function, i, e, certain, molecules, were, destructive, to, tissue, while, others, constructed, tissue, bennett, believed, that, diseases, developed, from, the, physical, properties, of, the, air, for, example, its, density, or, changes, in, temperature, bennett, believed, that, the, germs, that, pasteur, s, captured, couldn, t, be, identified, as, organic, organisms, the, components, of, the, dust, that, pasteur, captured, were, also, found, in, minerals, and, they, were, either, lint, debris, from, clothing, or, vegetable, or, pieces, of, seeds, bennett, particularly, disagreed, about, temperature, pasteur, stated, that, germs, died, when, heated, to, 30, degrees, above, boiling, and, also, from, extreme, cold, in, the, lecture, he, referred, to, pouchet, s, experiments, which, duplicated, pasteur, s, experiments, and, refuted, pasteurs, conclusions, bennet, didn, t, realise, that, pasteur, proved, his, theory, by, both, isolating, the, germs, and, stopping, them, from, reappearing, in, his, experiments, bennett, reported, that, he, proved, that, germs, generate, spontaneously, so, one, could, never, create, a, germ, free, environment, it, was, likely, that, hughes, bennett, never, adequately, sterilized, his, experimental, apparatus, correctly, on, 8, november, 1868, lister, gave, a, lecture, on, germ, theory, where, he, elaborated, on, the, origin, of, germs, as, a, rebuttal, of, bennett, s, theory, in, 1869, at, the, meetings, of, the, british, association, at, leeds, lister, s, ideas, were, mocked, and, again, in, 1873, the, medical, journal, the, lancet, warned, the, entire, medical, profession, against, his, progressive, ideas, however, lister, did, have, some, supporters, including, marcus, beck, a, consultant, surgeon, at, university, college, hospital, who, not, only, practised, lister, s, antiseptic, technique, but, included, it, in, the, next, edition, of, one, of, the, main, surgical, textbooks, of, the, time, lister, s, use, of, carbolic, acid, proved, problematic, and, he, eventually, repudiated, it, for, superior, methods, the, spray, irritated, eyes, and, respiratory, tracts, and, the, soaked, bandages, were, suspected, of, damaging, tissue, so, his, teachings, and, methods, were, not, always, adopted, in, their, entirety, because, his, ideas, were, based, on, germ, theory, which, was, in, its, infancy, their, adoption, was, slow, general, criticism, of, his, methods, was, exacerbated, by, the, fact, that, he, found, it, hard, to, express, himself, adequately, in, writing, so, they, seemed, complicated, unorganised, and, impractical, lister, left, glasgow, university, in, october, 1869, and, was, succeeded, by, george, husband, baird, macleod, lister, then, returned, to, edinburgh, as, successor, to, syme, as, professor, of, surgery, at, the, university, of, edinburgh, and, continued, to, develop, improved, methods, of, antisepsis, and, asepsis, amongst, those, he, worked, with, there, who, helped, him, and, his, work, was, the, senior, apothecary, and, later, md, alexander, gunn, when, lister, attended, edinburgh, he, had, two, primary, objectives, the, first, was, to, perfect, the, design, of, his, dressings, the, second, was, to, improve, the, reliability, of, antiseptics, by, applying, the, technique, to, an, ever, wider, class, of, operations, the, cases, he, selected, for, this, were, the, repair, of, bone, deformities, along, with, the, rewiring, of, fractures, where, the, union, was, malformed, while, healing, in, 1870, lister, published, on, the, effects, of, the, antiseptic, system, of, treatment, upon, the, salubrity, of, a, surgical, hospital, lister, s, meticulous, nature, became, ever, more, apparent, when, he, moved, to, work, in, edinburgh, and, this, is, reflected, in, his, casebooks, for, wards, 4, and, 5, at, the, infirmary, on, 14, january, 1871, lister, published, his, first, details, of, gauze, and, spray, in, the, british, medical, journal, in, 1872, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, aesculapian, club, therefore, lister, tested, the, results, of, spraying, instruments, surgical, incisions, and, dressings, with, a, solution, of, carbolic, acid, lister, found, that, the, solution, swabbed, on, wounds, remarkably, reduced, the, incidence, of, gangrene, on, 10, february, 1877, scottish, surgeon, sir, william, fergusson, chair, of, systematic, surgery, at, king, s, college, hospital, died, on, 18, february, in, reply, to, a, tentative, approach, from, a, representative, of, kings, college, lister, stated, that, he, would, be, willing, to, accept, the, chair, on, the, proviso, that, he, could, radically, reform, the, teaching, there, there, was, no, doubt, that, lister, s, mission, was, both, evangelical, and, apostolic, and, this, was, his, true, purpose, in, moving, to, london, british, surgeon, john, wood, was, originally, next, in, line, and, was, elected, to, the, chair, wood, was, hostile, to, lister, obtaining, the, chair, on, 8, march, 1877, in, a, private, letter, to, an, associate, lister, contrasted, their, differing, teaching, methods, and, stated, in, no, uncertain, terms, his, opinion, of, fergusson, the, mere, fact, of, fergusson, having, held, the, clinical, chair, is, surely, a, matter, of, no, great, moment, in, a, comment, to, another, colleague, lister, stated, that, his, goal, in, taking, the, appointment, was, the, thorough, working, of, the, antiseptic, system, with, a, view, to, its, diffusion, in, the, metropolis, at, a, memorial, held, by, his, students, to, persuade, him, to, remain, lister, criticised, london, teaching, his, impromptu, speech, was, heard, by, a, reporter, that, ensured, it, was, published, in, the, london, and, edinburgh, newspapers, this, jeopardised, lister, s, position, as, word, reached, the, governing, council, at, king, s, college, who, awarded, the, chair, to, john, wood, a, few, weeks, later, however, negotiations, were, renewed, in, may, and, he, was, finally, elected, on, 18, june, 1877, to, a, newly, created, chair, of, clinical, surgery, the, second, clinical, surgery, chair, was, created, specifically, for, lister, as, the, hospital, feared, the, negative, publicity, that, would, have, resulted, had, lister, not, been, elected, on, 11, september, 1877, joseph, and, aggie, moved, to, london, and, the, couple, found, a, house, at, 12, park, crescent, regent, s, park, lister, began, teaching, on, the, first, day, of, october, the, hospital, made, it, mandatory, that, all, students, should, attend, lister, s, lecturers, attendance, was, small, compared, to, the, four, hundred, who, would, regularly, attend, his, classes, in, edinburgh, lister, s, conditions, of, employment, were, met, but, he, was, only, provided, with, 24, beds, instead, of, the, 60, beds, that, he, was, used, to, in, edinburgh, lister, stipulated, that, he, should, be, able, to, bring, from, edinburgh, four, people, who, would, constitute, the, core, of, his, new, staff, at, the, hospital, these, were, watson, cheyne, who, became, his, assistant, surgeon, john, stewart, an, anatomical, artist, and, senior, assistant, along, with, w, h, dobie, and, james, altham, who, were, lister, s, dressers, surgical, assistants, who, dressed, wounds, there, was, considerable, friction, at, lister, s, first, lecture, both, from, students, who, heckled, him, and, staff, even, the, nurses, were, hostile, this, was, clearly, illustrated, in, october, 1877, when, a, patient, lizzie, thomas, who, travelled, from, edinburgh, royal, infirmary, to, be, treated, for, a, psoas, abscess, was, not, admitted, due, to, not, having, the, correct, paperwork, lister, could, hardly, believe, that, such, a, lack, of, sympathy, from, imperious, nurses, could, exist, more, so, such, a, state, of, mind, was, a, real, danger, to, his, patients, because, his, system, depended, on, loyal, staff, to, carry, out, the, preparations, for, antiseptic, surgery, on, 1, october, 1877, lister, held, the, customary, introductory, address, in, essence, his, inaugural, lecture, in, london, with, the, subject, the, nature, of, fermentation, lister, described, the, fermentation, of, milk, and, explained, how, putrefaction, was, caused, by, fermentation, of, blood, and, in, the, process, tried, to, prove, that, all, fermentation, was, due, to, microorganisms, for, his, demonstration, he, used, a, series, of, test, tubes, containing, milk, that, were, loosely, covered, with, glass, caps, although, air, had, entered, the, test, tubes, and, the, milk, had, not, decomposed, demonstrated, that, air, was, responsible, for, fermentation, the, experiment, had, two, conclusions, first, that, unboiled, milk, had, no, tendency, to, ferment, and, secondly, that, an, organism, that, lister, had, isolated, bacterium, lactis, was, the, cause, of, lactic, acid, fermentation, the, address, was, badly, received, in, defence, john, stewart, described, it, as, a, brilliant, and, most, hopeful, beginning, of, what, we, regarded, as, a, campaign, in, the, enemy, s, country, there, seemed, to, be, a, colossal, apathy, an, inconceivable, indifference, to, the, light, which, to, our, minds, shone, so, brightly, a, monstrous, inertia, to, the, force, of, new, ideas, in, october, 1877, lister, performed, an, operation, on, a, patient, francis, smith, that, was, not, considered, life, threatening, the, open, operation, on, a, fractured, patella, in, front, of, 200, students, involved, wiring, the, two, fragments, together, and, was, likely, the, first, case, in, which, a, healthy, knee, joint, was, ever, opened, in, 1881, lister, was, elected, president, of, the, clinical, society, of, london, in, october, 1883, st, clair, thomson, gathered, together, lister, s, first, seven, patients, who, had, knee, operations, for, examination, at, the, medical, society, of, london, meeting, he, also, developed, a, method, of, repairing, kneecaps, with, metal, wire, and, improved, the, technique, of, mastectomy, he, was, also, known, for, being, the, first, surgeon, to, use, catgut, ligatures, sutures, and, rubber, drains, and, developing, an, aortic, tourniquet, he, also, introduced, a, diluted, spray, of, carbolic, acid, combined, with, its, surgical, use, however, he, abandoned, the, carbolic, acid, sprays, in, the, late, 1890s, after, he, saw, it, provided, no, beneficial, change, in, the, outcomes, of, the, surgeries, performed, with, the, carbolic, acid, spray, the, only, reported, reactions, were, minor, symptoms, that, did, not, affect, the, surgical, outcome, as, a, whole, like, coughing, irritation, of, the, eye, and, minor, tissue, damage, among, his, patients, who, were, exposed, to, the, carbolic, acid, sprays, during, the, surgery, in, 1869, mathias, saxtorph, from, the, university, of, copenhagen, visited, lister, in, glasgow, to, adopt, his, methods, in, july, 1870, saxtorph, recognised, lister, s, technique, as, being, effective, in, a, letter, to, lister, where, he, stated, the, frederick, hospital, to, which, i, am, head, surgeon, is, a, very, old, building, and, i, have, 150, patients, in, the, surgical, wards, foremerly, there, used, to, be, every, year, several, cases, of, death, from, pyaemia, sometime, arising, from, the, most, trivial, injuries, now, i, have, had, the, satisfaction, that, not, a, single, case, of, pyaemia, has, occurred, since, i, came, home, last, year, which, result, is, certainly, owing, to, the, introduction, of, your, antiseptic, treatment, the, first, use, of, lister, s, method, in, germany, was, by, karl, thiersch, in, leipzig, in, 1867, thiersch, who, practised, lister, s, approach, since, its, introduction, never, published, his, results, but, taught, lister, s, methods, to, his, students, his, house, surgeon, hermann, georg, joseph, tested, it, on, 16, patients, who, had, abscesses, with, favourable, results, joseph, wrote, a, thesis, on, his, results, proving, the, value, of, the, lister, method, which, was, presented, in, leipzig, the, following, year, in, january, 1870, heinrich, adolf, von, bardeleben, presented, a, paper, to, the, berlin, medical, society, that, described, the, results, but, provided, no, statistical, evaluation, of, those, results, the, adoption, of, listerism, on, the, european, continent, was, halted, during, the, franco, prussian, war, but, it, became, the, greatest, opportunity, to, advance, lister, s, ideas, at, the, start, of, the, war, lister, had, written, a, pamphlet, known, as, a, method, of, antiseptic, treatment, applicable, to, wounded, soldiers, in, the, present, war, that, described, a, simplified, technique, of, antiseptic, that, could, be, used, on, the, battlefield, and, military, hospital, the, pamphlet, was, immediately, translated, into, german, however, it, never, made, a, material, difference, by, far, the, most, important, advocate, for, lister, s, antiseptic, system, in, germany, was, the, surgeon, and, osteotomy, specialist, richard, von, volkmann, who, taught, at, the, university, of, halle, in, august, 1870, he, became, surgeon, general, during, the, franco, prussian, war, and, was, responsible, for, 12, army, hospitals, and, 1442, beds, when, he, returned, to, his, own, hospital, in, the, winter, of, 1871, he, found, large, numbers, of, patients, with, infectious, diseases, throughout, the, ward, he, wrote, of, the, experience, the, mortality, after, large, amputations, and, complicated, fractures, grew, year, by, year, in, the, summer, of, 1871, during, my, absence, on, the, battlefield, the, clinic, was, crowded, by, a, large, amount, of, injured, for, eight, months, in, the, winter, of, 1871, to, 1872, the, numbers, of, blood, poisoning, and, rose, disease, victims, were, so, great, that, i, considered, applying, for, a, temporary, closure, of, the, facility, without, a, morgue, the, dead, stayed, in, the, cellar, beneath, the, wards, in, 1872, volkmann, sent, his, assistant, max, schede, to, visit, lister, at, his, clinic, to, learn, his, new, techniques, once, schede, returned, in, the, autumn, of, 1872, volkmann, began, to, use, lister, s, new, techniques, on, 16, february, 1873, in, a, letter, to, theodor, billroth, volkmann, wrote, since, autumn, of, last, year, 1872, i, have, been, experimenting, with, lister, s, method, already, the, first, trials, in, the, old, contaminated, house, show, wounds, healing, uneventful, without, fever, and, pus, in, april, 1874, volkmann, presented, a, lecture, with, the, title, about, antiseptic, occlusive, bandages, and, their, influence, on, the, healing, process, of, wounds, where, he, detailed, the, influence, of, lister, the, lecture, became, famous, in, germany, to, such, an, extent, that, lister, s, antiseptics, were, established, in, germany, faster, than, in, any, other, developed, country, at, the, german, congress, of, surgery, the, members, were, so, enthused, with, the, results, of, lister, s, work, that, they, invited, him, to, visit, germany, and, see, first, hand, the, results, of, his, work, lister, decided, to, accept, the, invitation, to, a, continental, tour, in, the, spring, of, 1875, lister, along, with, agnes, his, sister, in, law, and, two, nieces, left, edinburgh, the, group, spent, several, weeks, in, a, tour, that, began, in, cannes, in, france, visited, several, cities, in, italy, and, finished, with, a, four, day, visit, to, venice, the, first, place, in, germany, that, lister, visited, was, the, allgemeines, krankenhaus, general, hospital, in, munich, which, was, run, by, nussbaum, a, celebratory, dinner, was, held, in, munich, for, lister, with, seventy, guests, however, it, was, in, leipzig, where, lister, received, his, most, glorious, reception, a, banquet, was, held, with, between, three, and, four, hundred, guests, present, led, by, mc, karl, thiersch, lister, then, visited, volkmann, in, halle, before, visiting, berlin, where, the, group, was, entertained, by, heinrich, adolf, von, bardeleben, who, worked, at, the, charit, hospital, and, was, one, of, the, earliest, adopters, of, antiseptics, in, december, 1892, lister, attended, the, celebration, in, honour, of, the, 70th, birthday, of, pasteur, at, the, sorbonne, in, paris, the, theatre, designed, to, hold, 2500, people, was, crowded, and, included, the, university, governing, staff, ministers, of, state, ambassadors, the, president, of, france, sadi, carnot, and, representatives, from, the, institut, de, france, at, 10, 30am, pasteur, entered, beginning, the, ceremony, lister, invited, to, give, the, address, received, a, great, ovation, when, he, stood, up, in, his, speech, he, spoke, about, the, debt, that, he, and, surgery, owed, to, pasteur, in, a, scene, that, was, captured, later, by, jean, andr, rixens, pasteur, strode, forward, and, kissed, lister, on, both, cheeks, in, january, 1896, lister, was, present, when, pasteur, s, body, was, laid, in, his, tomb, at, the, pasteur, institute, in, 1893, four, days, into, their, spring, holiday, in, rapallo, italy, agnes, lister, died, from, acute, pneumonia, while, still, responsible, for, the, wards, at, kings, college, hospital, lister, s, private, practice, ceased, along, with, an, appetite, for, experimental, work, social, gatherings, were, severely, curtailed, studying, and, writing, lost, appeal, for, him, and, he, sank, into, religious, melancholy, on, 31, july, 1895, lister, retired, from, kings, college, hospital, lister, was, presented, with, a, portrait, painted, by, scottish, artist, john, henry, lorimer, in, a, small, presentation, held, in, recognition, of, the, affection, and, esteem, that, felt, by, his, colleagues, despite, suffering, a, stroke, he, still, came, into, the, public, light, from, time, to, time, he, had, for, several, years, been, a, surgeon, extraordinary, to, queen, victoria, and, from, march, 1900, was, appointed, the, serjeant, surgeon, to, the, queen, thus, becoming, the, senior, surgeon, in, the, medical, household, of, the, royal, household, of, the, sovereign, after, her, death, the, following, year, he, was, re, appointed, as, such, to, her, successor, king, edward, vii, on, 24, june, 1902, with, a, 10, day, history, of, appendicitis, with, a, distinct, mass, on, the, right, lower, quadrant, edward, was, operated, on, by, sir, frederick, treves, two, days, before, his, scheduled, coronation, like, all, internal, surgery, at, the, time, the, appendectomy, needed, by, the, king, still, posed, an, extremely, high, risk, of, death, by, post, operational, infection, and, surgeons, did, not, dare, operate, without, consulting, britain, s, leading, surgical, authority, lister, obligingly, advised, them, in, the, latest, antiseptic, surgical, methods, which, they, followed, to, the, letter, and, the, king, survived, later, telling, lister, i, know, that, if, it, had, not, been, for, you, and, your, work, i, wouldn, t, be, sitting, here, today, in, 1903, lister, left, london, to, live, in, the, coastal, village, of, walmer, at, park, house, lord,
