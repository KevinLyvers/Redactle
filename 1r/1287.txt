law, barred, inheritance, by, the, king, s, sisters, and, all, others, who, could, claim, descent, through, only, the, female, line, however, since, henry, of, navarre, was, a, huguenot, many, catholics, refused, to, acknowledge, the, succession, and, france, was, plunged, into, a, phase, of, the, wars, of, religion, known, as, the, war, of, the, three, henrys, 1587, 1589, the, duke, of, guise, pushed, for, complete, suppression, of, the, huguenots, and, had, much, support, among, catholic, loyalists, political, disagreements, among, the, parties, set, off, a, series, of, campaigns,

cities, his, effective, power, was, limited, to, blois, tours, and, the, surrounding, districts, in, the, general, chaos, henry, iii, relied, on, henry, of, navarre, and, his, huguenots, the, two, kings, were, united, by, a, common, interest, to, win, france, from, the, catholic, league, henry, iii, recognized, the, king, of, navarre, as, a, true, subject, and, frenchman, not, a, fanatic, huguenot, aiming, to, subjugate, catholics, and, catholic, royalist, nobles, also, rallied, to, them, with, this, combined, force, the, two, kings, marched, to, paris, the, morale, of, the, city, was, low, and, even, the, spanish, ambassador, believed, the, city, could, not, hold, out, longer, than, a, fortnight, however, on, 2, august, 1589, a, monk, infiltrated, henry, iii, s, camp, and, assassinated, him, when, henry, iii, died, his, ninth, cousin, once, removed, henry, of, navarre, nominally, became, king, of, france, the, catholic, league, however, strengthened, by, foreign, support, especially, from, spain, was, strong, enough, to, prevent, a, universal, recognition, of, his, new, title, pope, sixtus, v, excommunicated, henry, and, declared, him, ineligible, to, inherit, the, crown, most, of, the, catholic, nobles, who, had, joined, henry, iii, for, the, siege, of, paris, also, refused, to, recognize, henry, of, navarre, and, abandoned, him, he, set, about, winning, his, kingdom, by, force, of, arms, aided, by, english, money, and, german, troops, henry, s, catholic, uncle, charles, cardinal, de, bourbon, was, proclaimed, king, by, the, league, but, the, cardinal, was, henry, s, prisoner, at, the, time, henry, was, victorious, at, the, battle, of, arques, and, the, battle, of, ivry, but, failed, to, take, paris, after, besieging, it, in, 1590, when, cardinal, de, bourbon, died, in, 1590, the, league, could, not, agree, on, a, new, candidate, at, the, estates, general, called, to, settle, the, question, also, attended, by, the, envoys, of, spain, while, some, supported, various, guise, candidates, the, strongest, candidate, was, probably, the, infanta, isabella, clara, eugenia, of, spain, daughter, of, philip, ii, of, spain, whose, mother, elisabeth, had, been, the, eldest, daughter, of, henry, ii, of, france, in, the, religious, fervor, of, the, time, the, infanta, was, considered, a, suitable, queen, provided, she, married, a, suitable, husband, the, french, overwhelmingly, rejected, philip, s, first, choice, archduke, ernest, of, austria, the, emperor, s, brother, also, a, member, of, the, house, of, habsburg, in, case, of, such, opposition, philip, indicated, that, princes, of, the, house, of, lorraine, would, be, acceptable, to, him, the, duke, of, guise, a, son, of, the, duke, of, lorraine, and, the, son, of, the, duke, of, mayenne, the, spanish, ambassadors, selected, the, duke, of, guise, to, the, joy, of, the, league, however, at, that, moment, of, seeming, victory, the, envy, of, the, duke, of, mayenne, was, aroused, and, he, blocked, the, proposed, election, of, a, king, the, parlement, of, paris, also, upheld, the, salic, law, they, argued, that, if, the, french, accepted, natural, hereditary, succession, as, proposed, by, the, spaniards, and, accepted, a, woman, as, their, queen, then, the, ancient, claims, of, the, english, kings, would, be, confirmed, and, the, monarchy, of, centuries, past, would, be, rendered, illegal, the, parlement, admonished, mayenne, as, lieutenant, general, that, the, kings, of, france, had, resisted, the, interference, of, the, pope, in, political, matters, and, that, he, should, not, raise, a, foreign, prince, or, princess, to, the, throne, of, france, under, the, pretext, of, religion, mayenne, was, angered, that, he, had, not, been, consulted, prior, to, this, admonishment, but, yielded, since, their, aim, was, not, contrary, to, his, present, views, despite, these, setbacks, for, the, league, henry, remained, unable, to, take, control, of, paris, on, 25, july, 1593, with, the, encouragement, of, his, mistress, gabrielle, d, estr, es, henry, permanently, renounced, protestantism, and, converted, to, catholicism, to, secure, his, hold, on, the, french, crown, thereby, earning, the, resentment, of, the, huguenots, and, his, ally, elizabeth, i, of, england, he, was, said, to, have, declared, that, paris, vaut, bien, une, messe, paris, is, well, worth, a, mass, although, the, attribution, is, doubtful, his, acceptance, of, catholicism, secured, the, allegiance, of, the, vast, majority, of, his, subjects, since, reims, traditional, coronation, place, of, french, kings, was, still, occupied, by, the, catholic, league, henry, was, crowned, king, of, france, at, the, cathedral, of, chartres, on, 27, february, 1594, pope, clement, viii, lifted, excommunication, from, henry, on, 17, september, 1595, he, did, not, forget, his, former, calvinist, coreligionists, however, and, was, known, for, his, religious, tolerance, in, 1598, he, issued, the, edict, of, nantes, which, granted, circumscribed, liberties, to, the, huguenots, henry, iv, successfully, ended, the, civil, wars, he, and, his, ministers, appeased, catholic, leaders, using, bribes, of, about, 7, million, cus, a, sum, greater, than, france, s, annual, revenue, in, combination, with, other, fiscal, problems, the, king, was, faced, with, a, financial, crisis, by, the, middle, of, the, 1590s, in, response, to, this, crisis, henry, resolved, to, convene, an, assembly, of, notables, in, november, 1596, that, he, hoped, would, approve, the, creation, of, new, royal, revenues, the, assembly, approved, the, creation, of, a, new, tax, on, goods, entering, towns, that, would, be, known, as, the, pancarte, however, in, 1597, the, crown, was, again, rocked, by, military, crisis, when, the, spanish, seized, amiens, huguenot, leaders, were, placated, by, the, edict, of, nantes, which, had, four, separate, sections, the, articles, laid, down, the, tolerance, which, would, be, accorded, to, the, huguenots, including, the, exact, places, where, worship, may, or, may, not, take, place, the, recognition, of, three, protestant, universities, and, the, allowance, of, protestant, synods, the, king, also, issued, two, personal, documents, called, brevets, which, recognized, the, protestant, establishment, the, edict, of, nantes, signed, religious, tolerance, into, law, and, the, brevets, were, an, act, of, benevolence, that, created, a, protestant, state, within, france, despite, this, it, would, take, years, to, restore, law, and, order, to, france, the, edict, was, met, by, opposition, from, the, parlements, which, objected, to, the, guarantees, offered, to, protestants, the, parlement, de, rouen, did, not, formally, register, the, edict, until, 1609, although, it, begrudgingly, observed, its, terms, during, his, reign, henry, iv, worked, through, the, minister, maximilien, de, b, thune, duke, of, sully, to, regularize,

been, the, principal, backer, of, the, catholic, league, and, it, tried, to, thwart, henry, under, the, duke, of, parma, an, army, from, the, spanish, netherlands, intervened, in, 1590, against, henry, and, foiled, his, siege, of, paris, another, spanish, army, helped, the, catholic, league, nobles, opposing, henry, to, win, the, battle, of, craon, in, 1592, the, spanish, war, was, not, ended, with, henry, s, coronation, but, after, his, victory, at, the, siege, of, amiens, in, september, 1597, the, peace, of, vervins, was, signed, in, 1598, this, freed, his, armies, to, settle, the, dispute, with, the, duchy, of, savoy, ending, with, the, treaty, of, lyon, of, 1601, which, arranged, territorial, exchanges, one, of, henry, s, major, problems, was, the, spanish, road, which, traversed, spanish, territory, through, savoy, to, the, low, countries, his, first, opportunity, to, cut, the, spanish, road, was, a, dispute, over, the, ownership, of, the, marquisate, of, saluzzo, the, last, marquis, left, saluzzo, to, the, french, crown, in, 1548, when, savoy, was, occupied, by, france, but, the, territory, became, disputed, during, the, chaos, of, the, wars, of, religion, the, pope, was, asked, to, arbitrate, between, the, claims, of, france, and, the, duke, of, savoy, the, duke, offered, to, cede, bresse, to, france, if, he, could, retain, saluzzo, henri, iv, accepted, this, but, spain, objected, that, bresse, was, a, vital, part, of, the, spanish, road, and, persuaded, the, duke, to, reject, the, decision, henry, iv, was, already, at, lyon, and, had, soldiers, ready, and, four, days, later, he, marched, fifty, thousand, men, against, the, duchy, occupying, almost, all, of, its, area, west, of, the, alps, in, january, 1601, henry, accepted, another, offer, of, papal, arbitration, and, gained, not, only, bresse, but, bugey, and, gex, savoy, retained, a, narrow, corridor, through, the, val, de, ch, zery, this, still, allowed, spanish, troops, to, cross, from, lombardy, to, franche, comt, without, going, through, france, but, it, created, a, choke, point, where, the, spanish, road, was, a, single, bridge, across, the, rh, ne, river, the, saluzzo, conflict, was, henry, iv, s, last, major, military, operation, but, he, continued, to, finance, spain, s, enemies, he, generously, assisted, the, dutch, republic, with, over, 12,

attempted, to, capture, the, city, in, 1602, in, 1609, the, death, of, the, childless, johann, william, duke, of, j, lich, cleves, berg, meant, that, the, succession, of, the, wealthy, duchies, were, in, dispute, henry, aimed, to, maintain, peace, among, the, protestant, princes, of, the, holy, roman, empire, to, present, a, united, front, against, the, habsburgs, to, achieve, this, henry, encouraged, a, peaceful, settlement, over, the, succession, between, the, two, main, protestant, claimants, wolfgang, wilhelm, of, palatinate, neuburg, and, johann, sigismund, of, brandenburg, he, communicated, this, with, maurice, landgrave, of, hesse, kassel, a, significant, protestant, leader, who, then, sought, to, facilitate, an, agreement, between, wolfgang, and, johann, sigismund, when, peace, was, negotiated, in, the, treaty, of, dortmund, henry, sent, congratulatory, messages, to, the, protestant, claimants, and, voiced, his, support, particularly, against, the, habsburgs, who, were, likely, to, challenge, the, treaty, when, habsburg, forces, invaded, j, lich, starting, the, war, of, the, j, lich, succession, henry, decided, to, act, on, 29, july, after, consulting, his, advisors, henry, ordered, a, french, army, to, support, the, protestant, claimants, maximilien, de, b, thune, duke, of, sully, his, financial, advisor, was, particularly, keen, on, joining, the, war, as, france, s, finances, at, the, time, were, secure, henry, declared, that, he, was, defending, the, rights, of, the, imperial, princes, and, also, that, he, was, honoring, his, previously, agreements, to, defend, the, protestant, claimants, henry, also, was, seeking, to, curb, the, power, of, the, habsburgs, henry, s, actions, faced, critique, some, saw, him, as, a, warmonger, the, papacy, in, particular, was, concerned, that, henry, was, supporting, protestant, princes, henry, responded, to, the, papacy, declaring, that, he, was, keeping, the, peace, when, habsburg, ambassadors, told, henry, that, he, was, contributing, to, the, decline, of, catholicism, by, supporting, the, protestant, claimants, henry, declared, that, he, was, merely, trying, to, contain, the, habsburgs, he, also, warned, the, papacy, to, keep, religion, out, of, succession, affairs, france, assured, the, protestant, princes, of, the, empire, that, despite, being, catholic, the, french, would, still, provide, aid, henry, also, sought, to, gain, the, aid, of, the, english, and, dutch, henry, greatly, pressured, the, dutch, for, support, appealing, directly, to, states, general,

henry, was, preparing, to, escalate, the, war, against, the, holy, roman, empire, which, was, prevented, by, his, assassination, and, the, subsequent, rapprochement, with, spain, under, the, regency, of, marie, de, medici, even, before, henry, s, accession, to, the, french, throne, the, french, huguenots, were, in, contact, with, aragonese, moriscos, in, plans, against, the, habsburg, government,

with, the, dey, of, algiers, and, the, ottoman, empire, but, this, project, floundered, with, the, arrival, of, john, of, austria, in, aragon, and, the, disarmament, of, the, moriscos, in, 1576, a, three, pronged, ottoman, fleet, from, constantinople, was, planned, to, disembark, between, murcia, and, valencia, while, the, french, huguenots, would, invade, from, the, north, and, the, moriscos, accomplish, their, uprising, but, the, fleet, failed, to, arrive, after, his, crowning, henry, continued, the, policy, of, a, franco, ottoman, alliance, and, received, an, embassy, from, sultan,
