time, of, troubles, the, english, word, terrible, is, usually, used, to, translate, the, russian, word, grozny, in, ivan, s, epithet, but, this, is, a, somewhat, archaic, translation, the, russian, word, reflects, the, older, english, usage, of, terrible, as, in, inspiring, fear, or, terror, dangerous, powerful, i, e, similar, to, modern, english, terrifying, it, does, not, convey, the, more, modern, connotations, of, english, terrible, such, as, defective, or, evil, according, to, edward, l, keenan, ivan, the, terrible, s, image, in, popular, culture, as, a, tyrant, came, from, politicised, western, travel, literature, of, the, renaissance, era, anti, russian, propaganda, during, the, livonian, war, portrayed, ivan, as, a, sadistic, and, oriental, despot, vladimir, dal, defines, grozny, specifically, in, archaic, usage, and, as, an, epithet, for, tsars, courageous, magnificent, magisterial, and, keeping, enemies, in, fear, but, people, in, obedience, other,

imitating, his, grandfather, ivan, iii, until, then, the, rulers, of, moscow, were, crowned, as, grand, princes, but, ivan, iii, assumed, the, title, of, sovereign, of, all, russia, and, used, the, title, of, tsar, in, his, correspondence, with, other, monarchs, two, weeks, after, his, coronation, ivan, married, his, first, wife, anastasia, romanovna, a, member, of, the, romanov, family, who, became, the, first, russian, tsaritsa, by, being, crowned, tsar, ivan, was, sending, a, message, to, the, world, and, to, russia, that, he, was, now, the, only, supreme, ruler, of, the, country, and, his, will, was, not, to, be, questioned, according, to, historian, janet, martin, the, new, title, symbolized, an, assumption, of, powers, equivalent, and, parallel, to, those, held, by, the, former, byzantine, caesar, and, the, tatar, khan, both, known, in, russian, sources, as, tsar, the, political, effect, was, to, elevate, ivan, s, position, the, new, title, not, only, secured, the, throne, but, also, granted, ivan, a, new, dimension, of, power, that, was, intimately, tied, to, religion, he, was, now, a, divine, leader, appointed, to, enact, god, s, will, as, church, texts, described,

tsars, adopted, mythological, genealogies, that, connected, them, to, ancient, rome, in, the, tale, of, the, princes, of, vladimir, their, lineage, is, traced, to, rurik, the, first, prince, of, novgorod, in, northern, russia, while, a, certain, prus, an, alleged, brother, of, augustus, who, ruled, what, would, become, prussia, is, mentioned, as, a, direct, ancestor, of, rurik, ivan, iv, often, mentioned, his, apparent, kinship, with, augustus, claiming, not, to, be, a, russe, and, highlighting, his, german, descent, from, rurik, such, genealogies, served, to, elevate, the, position, of, the, russian, monarch, in, the, eyes, of, his, subjects, and, other, european, powers, who, were, also, creating, mythological, ancestors, for, themselves, despite, calamities, triggered, by, the, great, fire, of, 1547, the, early, part, of, ivan, s, reign, was, one, of, peaceful, reforms, and, modernization, ivan, revised, the, law, code, creating, the, sudebnik, of, 1550, founded, a,

not, able, to, recover, while, on, his, presumed, deathbed, ivan, had, asked, the, boyars, to, swear, an, oath, of, allegiance, to, his, eldest, son, an, infant, at, the, time, many, boyars, refused, since, they, deemed, the, tsar, s, health, too, hopeless, for, him, to, survive, this, angered, ivan, and, added, to, his, distrust, of, the, boyars, there, followed, brutal, reprisals, and,

postnik, yakovlev, blinded, so, that, he, could, never, design, anything, as, beautiful, again, however, in, reality, postnik, yakovlev, went, on, to, design, more, churches, for, ivan, and, the, walls, of, the, kazan, kremlin, in, the, early, 1560s, as, well, as, the, chapel, over, st, basil, s, grave, which, was, added, to, st, basil, s, cathedral, in, 1588, several, years, after, ivan, s, death, although, more, than, one, architect, was, associated, with, that, name, it, is, believed, that, the, principal, architect, is, the, same, person, other, events, of, the, period, include, the,

siberian, khan, yadegar, and, the, nogai, horde, under, khan, ismail, pledged, their, allegiance, to, ivan, in, the, hope, that, he, would, help, them, against, their, opponents, however, yadegar, failed, to, gather, the, full, sum, of, tribute, that, he, proposed, to, the, tsar, and, so, ivan, did, nothing, to, save, his, inefficient, vassal, in, 1563, yadegar, was, overthrown, and, killed, by, khan, kuchum, who, denied, any, tribute, to, moscow, in, 1558, ivan, gave, the, stroganov, merchant, family, the, patent, for, colonising, the, abundant, region, along, the, kama, river, and, in, 1574, lands, over, the, ural, mountains, along, the, rivers, tura, and, tobol, the, family, also, received, permission, to, build, forts, along, the, ob, river, and, the, irtysh, river, around, 1577,

loyalties, and, to, become, tributaries, of, russia, some, agreed, voluntarily, because, they, were, offered, better, terms, than, with, kuchum, but, others, were, forced, he, also, established, distant, forts, in, the, newly, conquered, lands, the, campaign, was, successful, and, the, cossacks, managed, to, defeat, the, siberian, army, in, the, battle, of, chuvash, cape, but, yermak, still, needed, reinforcements, he, sent, an, envoy, to, ivan, the, terrible, with, a, message, that, proclaimed, yermak, conquered, siberia, to, be, part, of, russia, to, the, dismay, of, the, stroganovs, who, had, planned, to, keep, siberia, for, themselves, ivan, agreed, to, reinforce, the, cossacks, with, his, streltsy, but, the, detachment, sent, to, siberia, died, of, starvation, without, any, benefit, the, cossacks, were, defeated, by, the, local, peoples, yermak, died, and, the, survivors, immediately, left, siberia, only, in, 1586, two, years, after, the, death, of, ivan, would, the, russians, manage, to, gain, a, foothold, in, siberia, by, founding, the, city, of, tyumen, ivan, the, terrible, had, at, least, six, possibly, eight, wives, although, only, four, of, them, were, recognised, by, the, church, three, of, them, were, allegedly, poisoned, by, his, enemies, or, by, rival, aristocratic, families, who, wanted, to, promote, their, daughters, to, be, his, brides, he, also, had, nine, children, in, 1580, his, heir, ivan, ivanovich, married, yelena, sheremeteva, from, the, sheremetev, noble, family, which, was, a, rare, instance, of, the, daughter, of, a, boyar, marrying, into, the, dynasty, on, 19, november, 1581, ivan, chastised, yelena, for, being, unsuitably, dressed, considering, her, advanced, pregnancy, leading, to, an, altercation, with, his, son, ivan, ivanovich, historians, generally, believe, that, ivan, killed, his, son, in, a, fit, of, rage, with, the, argument, ending, after, the, elder, ivan, fatally, struck, his, son, in, the, head, with, his, pointed, staff, yelena, also, suffered, a, miscarriage, within, hours, of, the, incident, the, event, is, depicted, in, the, famous, painting, by, ilya, repin, ivan, the, terrible, and, his, son, ivan, according, to, historian, simon, sebag, montefiore, ivan, also, began, an, affair, with, the, courtier, fyodor, basmanov, when, the, magnate, dmitri, oblensky, ovchinin, sneered, to, basmanov, that, we, serve, the, tsar, in, useful, ways, you, in, your, filthy, sodomitical, dealings, ivan, scalded, and, stabbed, him, to, death, ivan, was, a, poet, and, a, composer, of, considerable, talent, his, orthodox, liturgical, hymn, stichiron, no, 1, in, honor, of, st, peter, and, fragments, of, his, letters, were, set, to, music, by, the, soviet, composer, rodion, shchedrin, the, recording, the, first, soviet, produced, cd, was, released, in, 1988, to, mark, the, millennium, of, christianity, in, russia, d, s, mirsky, called, ivan, a, pamphleteer, of, genius, the, letters, are, often, the, only, existing, source, on, ivan, s, personality, and, provide, crucial, information, on, his, reign, but, harvard, professor, edward, l, keenan, has, argued, that, the, letters, are, 17th, century, forgeries, that, contention, however, has, not, been, widely, accepted, and, most, other, scholars, such, as, john, fennell, and, ruslan, skrynnikov, have, continued, to, argue, for, their, authenticity, recent, archival, discoveries, of, 16th, century, copies, of, the, letters, strengthen, the, argument, for, their, authenticity, ivan, was, a, devoted, follower, of, christian, orthodoxy, but, in, his, own, specific, manner, he, placed, the, most, emphasis, on, defending, the, divine, right, of, the, ruler, to, unlimited, power, under, god, some, scholars, explain, the, sadistic, and, brutal, deeds, of, ivan, the, terrible, with, the, religious, concepts, of, the, 16th, century, which, included, drowning, and, roasting, people, alive, or, torturing, victims, with, boiling, or, freezing, water, corresponding, to, the, torments, of, hell, that, was, consistent, with, ivan, s, view, of, being, god, s, representative, on, earth, with, a, sacred, right, and, duty, to, punish, he, may, also, have, been, inspired, by, the, model, of, archangel, michael, with, the, idea, of, divine, punishment, ivan, the, terrible, is, quoted, stating, i, will, not, see, the, destruction, of, the, christian, converts, who, are, loyal, to, me, and, to, my, last, breath, i, will, fight, for, the, orthodox, faith, despite, the, absolute, prohibition, of, the, church, for, even, the, fourth, marriage, ivan, had, seven, wives, even, while, his, seventh, wife, was, alive, he, was, negotiating, to, marry, mary, hastings, a, distant, relative, of, queen, elizabeth, of, england, polygamy, was, also, prohibited, by, the, church, still, ivan, planned, to, put, his, wife, away, ivan, freely, interfered, in, church, affairs, by, ousting, metropolitan, philip, and, ordering, him, to, be, killed, and, accusing, of, treason, and, deposing, the, second, oldest, hierarch, novgorod, archbishop, pimen, many, monks, were, tortured, to, death, during, the, massacre, of, novgorod, in, the, conquered, khanates, of, khazan, and, atrakhan, ivan, was, somewhat, tolerant, of, islam, this, was, largely, to, avoid, a, conflict, with, the, ottoman, sultan, over, control, of, newly, conquered, tatar, regions, he, considered, these, conquests, to, be, a, christian, victory, he, was, notable, for, his, anti, semitism, for, example, after, the, capture, of, polotsk, all, unconverted, jews, were, ordered, to, be, drowned, despite, their, role, in, the, city, s, economy, ivan, died, from, a, stroke, while, he, was, playing, chess, with, bogdan, belsky, on, 28, march, 1584, upon, ivan, s, death, the, russian, throne, was, left, to, his, middle, son, feodor, a, weak, minded, figure, feodor, died, childless, in, 1598, which, ushered, in, the, time, of, troubles, little, is, known, about, ivan, s, appearance, as, virtually, all, existing, portraits, were, made, after, his, death, and, contain, uncertain, amounts, of, artist, s, impression, in, 1567, the, ambassador, daniel, prinz, von, buchau, said, about, ivan, that, he, is, very, tall, his, body, is, full, of, strength, and, quite, thick, his, large, eyes, which, constantly, run, around, observe, everything, carefully, his, beard, is, red, with, a, slight, shade, of, black, quite, long, and, thick, but, like, most, russians, he, shaves, his, hair, with, a, razor, according, to, ivan, katyryov, rostovsky, the, son, in, law, of, michael, i, of, russia, ivan, had, an, unpleasant, face, with, a, long, and, crooked, nose, he, was, tall, and, athletically, built, with, broad, shoulders, and, a, narrow, waist, in, 1963, the, graves, of, ivan, and, his, sons, were, excavated, and, examined, by, soviet, scientists, chemical, and, structural, analysis, of, his, remains, disproved, earlier, suggestions, that, ivan, suffered, from, syphilis, or, that, he, was, poisoned, by, arsenic, or, strangled, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, 178, cm, tall, 5, ft, 10, in, and, weighed, 85, 90, kg, 187, 198, lb, his, body, was, rather, asymmetrical, had, a, large, amount, of, osteophytes, uncharacteristic, of, his, age, and, contained, excessive, concentration, of, mercury, researchers, concluded, that, ivan, was, athletically, built, in, his, youth, but, in, his, last, years, had, developed, various, bone, diseases, and, could, barely, move, they, attributed, the, high, mercury, content, in, his, body, to, his, use, of, ointments, to, heal, his, joints, ivan, had, the, following, title, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, the, great, sovereign, tsar, and, grand, prince, ivan, vasilyevich, of, all, russia, vladimir, moscow, novgorod, tsar, of, kazan, tsar, of, astrakhan, sovereign, of, pskov, grand, prince, of, smolensk, tver, yugorsk, perm, vyatka, bolgar,

siberian, lands, and, northern, countries, kazan, was, added, to, ivan, s, title, in, 1553, and, astrakhan, in, 1554, the, titles, tsar, of, kazan, tsar, of, astrakhan, first, appeared, in, 1556, the, title, master, of, all, the, siberian, lands, first, appeared, in, 1555, and, from, 1582, was, written, as, master, of, all, the, siberian, lands, and, northern, countries, during, the, livonian, war, livonia, first, appeared, in, his, title, in, 1558, polotsk, was, also, included, following, its, capture, in, 1562, despite, russia, s, defeat, in, the, livonian, war, the, title, of, livonia, was, not, abandoned, in, english, ivan, s, title, of, tsar, was, often, translated, as, emperor, from, the, first, visit, of, richard, chancellor, to, moscow, in, 1553, for, example, we, greatest, ivan, vassilleviche, by, the, grace, of, god, emperor, of, all, russia, and, great, duke, however, the, title, was, not, consistently, translated, as, emperor, such, as, in, 1582, the, great, lord, king, and, great, duke, john, the, sonne, of, vasili, of, all, russia, ivan, completely, altered, russia, s, governmental, structure, establishing, the, character, of, modern, russian, political, organisation, ivan, s, creation, of, the, oprichnina, answerable, only, to, him, afforded, him, personal, protection, and, curtailed, the, traditional, powers, and, rights, of, the, boyars, henceforth, tsarist, autocracy, and, despotism, would, lie, at, the, heart, of, the, russian, state, ivan, bypassed, the, mestnichestvo, system, and, offered, positions, of, power, to, his, supporters, among, the, minor, gentry, the, empire, s, local, administration, combined, both, locally, and, centrally, appointed, officials, the, system, proved, durable, and, practical, and, sufficiently, flexible, to, tolerate, later, modification, ivan, s, expedition, against, poland, failed, at, a, military, level, but, it, helped, extend, russia, s, trade, political, and, cultural, links, with, other, european, states, peter, the, great, built, on, those, connections, in, his, bid, to, make, russia, a, major, european, power, at, ivan, s, death, the, empire, encompassed, the, caspian, to, the, southwest, and, western, siberia, to, the, east, his, southern, conquests, ignited, several, conflicts, with, the, expansionist, ottoman, empire, whose, territories, were, thus, confined, to, the, balkans, and, the, black, sea, regions, ivan, s, management, of, russia, s, economy, proved, disastrous, both, in, his, lifetime, and, afterward, he, had, inherited, a, government, in, debt, and, in, an, effort, to, raise, more, revenue, for, his, expansionist, wars, he, instituted, a, series, of, increasingly, unpopular, and, burdensome, taxes, successive, wars, drained, russia, of, manpower, and, resources, and, brought, it, to, the, brink, of, ruin, after, ivan, s, death, his, empire, s, nearly, ruined, economy, contributed, to, the, decline, of, his, own, rurik, dynasty, leading, to, the, time, of, troubles, ivan, s, notorious, outbursts, and, autocratic, whims, helped, characterise, the, position, of, tsar, as, one, accountable, to, no, earthly, authority, but, only, to, god, tsarist, absolutism, faced, few, serious, challenges, until, the, 19th, century, the, earliest, and, most, influential, account, of, his, reign, prior, to, 1917, was, by, the, historian, n, m, karamzin, who, described, ivan, as, a, tormentor, of, his, people, particularly, from, 1560, though, even, after, that, date, karamzin, believed, there, was, a, mix, of, good, and, evil, in, his, character, in, 1922, the, historian, robert, wipper, who, later, returned, to, his, native, latvia, to, avoid, living, under, communist, rule, wrote, a, biography, that, reassessed, ivan, as, a, monarch, who, loved, the, ordinary, people, and, praised, his, agrarian, reforms, in, the, 1920s, mikhail, pokrovsky, who, dominated, the, study, of, history, in, the, soviet, union, attributed, the, success, of, the, oprichnina, to, their, being, on, the, side, of, the, small, state, owners, and, townsfolk, in, a, decades, long, class, struggle, against, the, large, landowners, and, downgraded, ivan, s, role, to, that, of, the, instrument, of, the, emerging, russian, bourgeoisie, but, in, february, 1941, the, poet, boris, pasternak, observantly, remarked, in, a, letter, to, his, cousin, that, the, new, cult, openly, proselytized, is, ivan, the, terrible, the, oprichnina, the, brutality, joseph, stalin, who, had, read, wipper, s, biography, had, decided, that, soviet, historians, should, praise, the, role, of, strong, leaders, such, as, ivan, alexander, nevsky, and, peter, the, great, who, had, strengthened, and, expanded, russia, in, post, soviet, russia, a, campaign, has, been, run, to, seek, the, granting, of, sainthood, to, ivan, iv, but, the, russian, orthodox, church, opposed, the, idea, a, consequence, was, that, the, writer, alexei, tolstoy, began, work, on, a, stage, version, of, ivan, s, life, and, sergei, eisenstein, began, what, was, to, be, a, three, part, film, tribute, to, ivan, both, projects, were, personally, supervised, by, stalin, at, a, time, when, the, soviet, union, was, engaged, in, a, war, with, nazi, germany, he, read, the, scripts, of, tolstoy, s, play, and, the, first, of, eisenstein, s, films, in, tandem, after, the, battle, of, kursk, in, 1943, praised, eisenstein, s, version, but, rejected, tolstoy, s, it, took, tolstoy, until, 1944, to, write, a, version, that, satisfied, the, dictator, eisenstein, s, success, with, ivan, the, terrible, part, 1, was, not, repeated, with, the, follow, up, the, boyar, s, revolt, which, angered, stalin, because, it, portrayed, a, man, suffering, pangs, of, conscience, stalin, told, eisenstein, ivan, the, terrible, was, very, cruel, you, can, show, that, he, was, cruel, but, you, have, to, show, why, it, was, essential, to, be, cruel, one, of, ivan, the, terrible, s, mistakes, was, that, he, didn, t, finish, off, the, five, major, families, the, film, was, suppressed, until, 1958, the, first, statue, of, ivan, the, terrible, was, officially, open, in, oryol, russia, in, 2016, formally, the, statue, was, unveiled, in, honor, of, the, 450th, anniversary, of, the, founding, of, oryol, a, russian, city, of, about, 310, 000, that, was, established, as, a, fortress, to, defend, moscow, s, southern, borders, informally, there, was, a, big, political, subtext, the, opposition, thinks, that, ivan, the, terrible, s, rehabilitation, echoes, of, stalin, s, era, the, erection, of, the, statue, was, vastly, covered, in, international, media, like, the, guardian, the, washington, post, politico, and, others, the, russian, orthodox, church, officially, supported, the, erection, of, the, monument, patrilineal, descent, is, the, principle, behind, membership, in, royal, houses, as, it, can, be, traced, back, through, the, generations, which, means, that, if, ivan, iv, were, to, choose, a, historically, accurate, house, name, it, would, be, rurikid, as, all, his, male, line, ancestors, have, been, of, that, house, ivan, is, a, member, of, the, rurikid, dynasty, ivan, s, patriline, is, the, line, from, which, he, is, descended, father, to, son
