raising, taxes, on, tobacco, alcohol, and, salt, and, extracting, levies, from, france, s, satellite, republics, bonaparte, believed, that, the, best, way, to, secure, his, regime, was, by, a, victorious, peace, in, may, 1800, he, led, an, army, across, the, swiss, alps, into, italy, aiming, to, surprise, the, austrian, armies, that, had, reoccupied, the, peninsula, when, bonaparte, was,

increased, his, popularity, and, political, authority, however, he, still, faced, royalist, plots, and, feared, jacobin, influence, especially, in, the, army, several, assassination, plots, including, the, conspiration, des, poignards, dagger, plot, in, october, 1800, and, the, plot, of, the, rue, saint, nicaise, two, months, later, gave, him, a, pretext, to, arrest, about, 100, suspected,

bonaparte, offered, an, amnesty, to, most, migr, s, who, wished, to, return, to, france, with, europe, at, peace, and, the, economy, recovering, bonaparte, became, increasingly, popular, both, domestically, and, abroad, in, may, 1802, the, council, of, state, recommended, a, new, plebiscite, asking, the, french, people, to, make, napoleon, bonaparte, consul, for, life, it, was, the, first,

slavery, in, february, 1794, but, in, may, 1802, bonaparte, reintroduced, it, in, all, the, recovered, colonies, except, saint, domingue, and, guadeloupe, which, were, under, the, control, of, rebel, generals, a, french, military, expedition, under, antoine, richepanse, regained, control, of, guadeloupe, and, slavery, was, reintroduced, there, on, 16, july, saint, domingue, was, the, most, profitable, of, the, colonies, a, major, source, of, sugar, coffee, and, indigo, but, was, under, the, control, of, the, former, slave, toussaint, louverture, bonaparte, sent, the, saint, domingue, expedition, under, his, brother, in, law, general, leclerc, to, retake, the, colony, and, they, landed, there, in, february, 1802, with, 29, 000, men, although, toussaint, was, captured, and, sent, to, france, in, july, the, expedition, ultimately, failed, due, to, high, rates, of, disease, and, a, string, of, defeats, against, rebel, commander, jean, jacques, dessalines, in, may, 1803, bonaparte, acknowledged, defeat, and, the, last, 8, 000, french, troops, left, the, island, the, former, slaves, proclaimed, the, independent, republic, of, haiti, in, 1804, as, war, with, britain, again, loomed, in, 1803, bonaparte, realized, that, his, american, colony, of, louisiana, would, be, difficult, to, defend, in, need, of, funds, he, agreed, to, the, louisiana, purchase, with, the, united, states, doubling, the, latter, s, size, the, price, was, 15, million, the, peace, with, britain, was, uneasy, britain, did, not, evacuate, malta, as, promised, and, protested, against, bonaparte, s, annexation, of, piedmont, and, his, act, of, mediation, which, established, a, new, swiss, confederation, neither, of, these, territories, were, covered, by, amiens, but, they, inflamed, tensions, significantly, as, did, bonaparte, s, occupation, of, holland, and, apparent, ambitions, in, india, the, dispute, culminated, in, a, declaration, of, war, by, britain, in, may, 1803, bonaparte, responded, by, reassembling, the, invasion, camp, at, boulogne, and, ordering, the, arrest, of, every, british, male, between, eighteen, and, sixty, years, old, in, france, and, its, dependencies, as, a, prisoner, of, war, in, february, 1804, bonaparte, s, police, made, a, series, of, arrests, in, relation, to, a, royalist, plot, to, kidnap, or, assassinate, him, that, involved, the, british, government, moreau, and, an, unnamed, bourbon, prince, on, the, advice, of, his, foreign, minister, talleyrand, napoleon, ordered, the, kidnapping, of, the, duke, of, enghien, violating,

and, execution, infuriated, royalists, and, monarchs, throughout, europe, and, drew, a, formal, protest, from, russia, following, the, royalist, plot, bonaparte, s, supporters, convinced, him, that, creating, a, hereditary, regime, would, help, secure, it, in, case, of, his, death, make, it, more, acceptable, to, constitutional, monarchists, and, put, it, on, the, same, footing, as, other, european, monarchies, on, 18, may, the, senate, proclaimed, napoleon, emperor, of, the, french, and, approved, a, new, constitution, the, following, day, napoleon, appointed, 18, of, his, leading,

may, napoleon, crowned, himself, king, of, italy, with, the, iron, crown, of, lombardy, at, the, cathedral, of, milan, austria, saw, this, as, a, provocation, because, of, its, own, territorial, interests, in, italy, when, napoleon, incorporated, genoa, and, liguria, into, his, empire, austria, formally, protested, against, this, violation, of, the, treaty, of, lun, ville, by, september,

for, an, invasion, of, britain, they, never, invaded, but, the, force, formed, the, core, of, napoleon, s, grande, arm, e, created, in, august, 1805, at, the, start, this, french, army, had, about, 200, 000, men, organized, into, seven, corps, artillery, and, cavalry, reserves, and, the, lite, imperial, guard, by, august, 1805, the, grande, arm, e, had, grown, to, a, force, of, 350, 000, men, who, were, well, equipped, well, trained, and, led, by, competent, officers, to, facilitate, the, invasion, napoleon, planned, to, lure, the, royal, navy, from, the, english, channel, by, a, diversionary, attack, on, the, british, west, indies, however, the, plan, unravelled, after, the, british, victory, at, the, battle, of, cape, finisterre, in, july, 1805, french, admiral, villeneuve, then, retreated, to, c, diz, instead, of, linking, up, with, french, naval, forces, at, brest, for, an, attack, on, the, english, channel, facing, a, potential, invasion, from, his, continental, enemies, napoleon, abandoned, his, invasion, of, england, and, sought, to, destroy, the, isolated, austrian, armies, in, southern, germany, before, their, russian, ally, could, arrive, in, force, on, 25, september, 200, 000, french, troops, began, to, cross, the, rhine, on, a, front, of, 260, km, 160, mi, austrian, commander, karl, mack, had, gathered, most, of, the, austrian, army, at, the, fortress, of, ulm, in, swabia, napoleon, s, army, however, moved, quickly, and, outflanked, the, austrian, positions, after, some, minor, engagements, that, culminated, in, the, battle, of, ulm, mack, surrendered, for, just, 2, 000, french, casualties, napoleon, had, captured, 60, 000, austrian, soldiers, through, his, army, s, rapid, marching, for, the, french, this, spectacular, victory, on, land, was, soured, by, the, decisive, victory, that, the, royal, navy, attained, at, the, battle, of, trafalgar, on, 21, october, after, trafalgar, the, royal, navy, was, never, again, seriously, challenged, by, napoleon, s, fleet, french, forces, occupied, vienna, in, november, capturing, 100, 000, muskets, 500, cannons, and, the, intact, bridges, across, the, danube, napoleon, then, sent, his, army, north, in, pursuit, of, the, allies, tsar, alexander, i, of, russia, and, francis, i, decided, to, engage, napoleon, in, battle, despite, reservations, from, some, of, their, subordinates, at, the, battle, of, austerlitz, on, 2, december, napoleon, deployed, his, army, below, the, pratzen, heights, he, ordered, his, right, wing, to, feign, retreat, enticing, the, allies, to, descend, from, the, heights, in, pursuit, the, french, centre, and, left, wing, then, captured, the, heights, and, caught, the, allies, in, a, pincer, movement, thousands, of, russian, troops, fled, across, a, frozen, lake, to, escape, the, trap, and, 100, to, 2, 000, of, them, drowned, about, a, third, of, the, allied, forces, were, killed, captured, or, wounded, the, disaster, at, austerlitz, led,

is, the, finest, of, all, i, have, fought, frank, mclynn, suggests, that, napoleon, was, so, successful, at, austerlitz, that, he, lost, touch, with, reality, and, what, used, to, be, french, foreign, policy, became, a, personal, napoleonic, one, vincent, cronin, disagrees, stating, that, napoleon, was, not, overly, ambitious, for, himself, he, embodied, the, ambitions, of, thirty, million, frenchmen, napoleon, continued, to, entertain, a, grand, scheme, to, establish, a, french, presence, in, the, middle, east, in, order, to, put, pressure, on, britain, and, russia, possibly, by, forming, an, alliance, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, february, 1806, ottoman, emperor, selim, iii, recognized, napoleon, as, emperor, he, also, opted, for, an, alliance, with, france, calling, france, our, sincere, and, natural, ally, that, decision, brought, the, ottoman, empire, into, a, losing, war, against, russia, and, britain, a, franco, persian, alliance, was, formed, between, napoleon, and, the, persian, empire, of, fat, h, ali, shah, qajar, it, collapsed, in, 1807, when, france, and, russia, formed, an, unexpected, alliance, in, the, end, napoleon, made, no, effective, alliances, in, the, middle, east, after, austerlitz, napoleon, increased, his, political, power, in, europe, in, 1806, he, deposed, the, bourbon, king, of, naples, and, installed, his, elder, brother, joseph, on, the, throne, he, then, made, his, younger, brother, louis, king, of, holland, he, also, established, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, a, collection, of, german, states, intended, to, serve, as, a, buffer, zone, between, france, and, central, europe, the, creation, of, the, confederation, spelled, the, end, of, the, holy, roman, empire, napoleon, s, growing, influence, in, germany, threatened, the, status, of, prussia, as, a, great, power, and, in, response, frederick, william, iii, decided, on, war, with, france, prussia, and, russia, signed, a, new, military, alliance, creating, the, fourth, coalition, against, france, prussia, however, committed, a, strategic, blunder, by, declaring, war, when, french, troops, were, still, in, southern, germany, and, months, before, sufficient, russian, troops, could, reach, the, front, napoleon, invaded, prussia, with, 180, 000, troops, rapidly, marching, on, the, right, bank, of, the, river, saale, upon, learning, the, whereabouts, of, the, prussian, army, the, french, swung, westwards, thus, cutting, the, prussians, off, from, berlin, and, the, slowly, approaching, russians, at, the, twin, battles, of, jena, and, auerstedt, fought, on, 14, october, the, french, convincingly, defeated, the, prussians, and, inflicted, heavy, casualties, with, several, major, commanders, dead, or, incapacitated, the, prussian, king, proved, incapable, of, effectively, commanding, the, army, which, quickly, disintegrated, in, the, following, month, the, french, captured, 140, 000, soldiers, and, over, 2, 000, cannon, despite, their, overwhelming, defeat, the, prussians, refused, to, negotiate, with, the, french, until, the, russians, had, an, opportunity, to, enter, the, fight, following, his, triumph, napoleon, imposed, the, first, elements, of, the, continental, system, through, the, berlin, decree, issued, in, november, 1806, the, continental, system, which, prohibited, european, nations, from, trading, with, britain, was, widely, violated, throughout, his, reign, in, the, next, few, months, napoleon, marched, against, the, advancing, russian, armies, through, poland, and, fought, a, bloody, stalemate, at, the, battle, of, eylau, in, february, 1807, after, a, period, of, rest, and, consolidation, on, both, sides, the, war, restarted, in, june, with, an, initial, struggle, at, heilsberg, that, proved, indecisive, on, 14, june, napoleon, obtained, an, overwhelming, victory, over, the, russians, at, the, battle, of, friedland, wiping, out, about, 30, of, the, russian, army, the, scale, of, their, defeat, convinced, the, russians, to, make, peace, with, the, french, the, two, emperors, began, peace, negotiations, on, 25, june, at, the, town, of, tilsit, during, a, meeting, on, a, raft, floating, in, the, middle, of, the, river, niemen, which, separated, the, french, and, russian, troops, and, their, respective, spheres, of, influence, napoleon, offered, alexander, relatively, lenient, terms, demanding, that, russia, join, the, continental, system, withdraw, its, forces, from, wallachia, and, moldavia, and, hand, over, the, ionian, islands, to, france, in, contrast, prussia, was, treated, harshly, it, lost, half, its, territory, and, population, and, underwent, a, two, year, occupation, costing, it, about, 1, 4, billion, francs, from, former, prussian, territory, napoleon, created, the, kingdom, of, westphalia, ruled, by, his, young, brother, j, r, me, and, the, duchy, of, warsaw, prussia, s, humiliating, treatment, at, tilsit, caused, lasting, resentment, against, france, in, that, country, the, treaty, was, also, unpopular, in, russia, putting, pressure, on, alexander, to, end, the, alliance, with, france, nevertheless, the, treaties, of, tilsit, gave, napoleon, a, respite, from, war, and, allowed, him, to, return, to, france, which, he, had, not, seen, in, over, 300, days, after, tilsit, napoleon, turned, his, attention, to, portugal, which, was, reluctant, to, strictly, enforce, the, blockade, against, its, traditional, ally, britain, on, 17, october, 1807, 24, 000, french, troops, under, general, junot, crossed, the, pyrenees, with, spanish, consent, and, headed, towards, portugal, to, enforce, the, blockade, junot, occupied, lisbon, in, november, but, the, portuguese, royal, family, had, already, fled, to, brazil, with, the, portuguese, fleet, in, march, 1808, a, palace, coup, led, to, the, abdication, of, the, spanish, king, carlos, iv, in, favour, of, his, son, fernando, vii, the, following, month, napoleon, summoned, carlos, and, fernando, to, bayonne, where, in, may, he, forced, them, both, to, relinquish, their, claims, to, the, spanish, throne, napoleon, then, made, his, brother, joseph, king, of, spain, by, then, there, were, 120, 000, french, troops, garrisoned, in, the, peninsula, and, widespread, spanish, opposition, to, the, occupation, and, the, overthrow, of, the, spanish, bourbons, on, 2, may, an, uprising, against, the, french, broke, out, in, madrid, and, spread, throughout, spain, in, the, following, weeks, in, the, face, of, brutal, french, repression, the, uprising, developed, into, a, sustained, conflict, in, july, joseph, travelled, to, madrid, where, he, was, proclaimed, king, of, spain, on, the, 24th, however, following, news, of, a, french, defeat, by, regular, spanish, forces, at, the, battle, of, bail, n, joseph, fled, madrid, several, days, later, the, following, month, a, british, force, landed, in, portugal, and, on, the, 21st, they, defeated, the, french, at, vimiero, under, the, convention, of, cintra, the, french, evacuated, portugal, the, defeats, at, bail, n, and, vimiero, convinced, napoleon, that, he, had, to, take, command, of, the, iberian, campaign, before, leaving, for, spain, he, attempted, to, strengthen, the, alliance, with, russia, and, obtain, a, commitment, from, alexander, that, russia, would, declare, war, on, austria, if, she, attacked, france, at, the, congress, of, erfurt, in, october, 1808, napoleon, and, alexander, reached, an, agreement, that, recognized, the, russian, conquest, of, finland, and, called, upon, britain, to,

although, their, implementation, varied, with, the, local, authorities, the, jews, of, france, had, been, granted, full, civil, rights, in, september, 1791, and, religious, equality, in, 1795, the, revolutionary, and, napoleonic, regimes, abolished, jewish, ghettoes, in, the, territories, they, conquered, napoleon, wished, to, assimilate, jews, into, french, society, and, convened, an, assembly, of, jewish, notables, in, 1806, to, that, end, in, 1807, he, summoned, a, sanhedrin, to, adapt, the, law, of, moses, to, those, of, the, empire, an, imperial, decree, of, march, 1808, organized, jewish, worship, into, consistories, limited, usury, and, encouraged, jews, to, adopt, a, family, name, intermarriage, and, civil, marriage, and, divorce, jews, however, were, still, subject, to, discrimination, in, many, parts, of, the, empire, and, satellite, states, pieter, geyl, wrote, in, 1947, it, is, impossible, that, two, historians, especially, two, historians, living, in, different, periods, should, see, any, historical, personality, in, the, same, light, there, is, no, dispute, that, napoleon, was, ambitious, although, commentators, disagree, on, whether, his, ambition, was, mostly, for, his, own, power, and, glory, or, for, the, welfare, of, france, historians, agree, that, napoleon, was, highly, intelligent, with, an, excellent, memory, and, was, a, superior, organizer, who, could, work, efficiently, for, long, hours, in, battle, he, could, rapidly, dictate, a, series, of, complex, commands, to, his, subordinates, keeping, in, mind, where, major, units, were, expected, to, be, at, each, future, point, he, was, an, inspiring, leader, who, could, obtain, the, best, from, his, soldiers, and, subordinates, arthur, wellesley, 1st, duke, of, wellington, said, his, presence, on, the, battlefield, was, worth, 40, 000, soldiers, he, could, charm, people, when, he, needed, to, but, could, also, publicly, humiliate, them, and, was, known, for, his, rages, when, his, plans, were, frustrated, historian, mclynn, sees, him, as, a, misogynist, with, a, cruel, streak, which, he, often, inflicted, on, women, children, and, animals, there, is, debate, over, whether, napoleon, was, an, outsider, who, never, felt, at, home, in, france, or, with, other, people, hippolyte, taine, said, napoleon, saw, others, only, as, instruments, and, was, cut, off, from, feelings, of, admiration, sympathy, or, pity, arthur, l, vy, replied, that, napoleon, genuinely, loved, jos, phine, and, often, showed, humanity, and, compassion, to, his, enemies, or, those, who, had, let, him, down, he, had, the, normal, middle, class, virtues, and, understood, the, common, man, similarly, historians, are, divided, over, whether, napoleon, was, consistently, ruthless, when, his, power, was, threatened, or, surprisingly, indulgent, in, some, cases, those, arguing, for, a, ruthless, personality, point, to, episodes, such, as, his, violent, suppression, of, revolts, in, france, and, conquered, territories, his, execution, of, the, duc, d, enghien, and, plotters, against, his, rule, and, his, massacre, of, turkish, prisoners, of, war, in, syria, in, 1799, others, point, to, his, mild, treatment, of, disloyal, subordinates, such, as, charles, xiv, john, talleyrand, and, fouch, many, historians, see, napoleon, as, pragmatic, and, a, realist, at, least, in, the, early, years, of, his, rule, he, was, not, driven, by, ideology, and, promoted, capable, men, irrespective, of, their, political, and, social, background, as, long, as, they, were, loyal, as, an, expert, in, military, matters, he, valued, technical, expertise, and, listened, to, the, advice, of, experts, in, other, fields, however, there, is, a, consensus, that, once, he, dominated, europe, he, became, more, intolerant, of, other, views, and, surrounded, himself, with, yes, men, towards, the, end, of, his, reign, he, lost, his, realism, and, ability, to, compromise, some, historians, talk, of, napoleon, s, dual, nature, a, rationalist, with, a, strong, romantic, streak, he, took, a, team, of, scholars, artists, and, engineers, with, him, to, egypt, in, order, to, scientifically, study, the, country, s, culture, and, history, but, at, the, same, time, was, struck, by, romantic, orientalism, i, was, full, of, dreams, he, stated, i, saw, myself, founding, a, religion, marching, into, asia, riding, an, elephant, a, turban, on, my, head, and, in, my, hand, a, new, koran, that, i, would, have, composed, to, suit, my, need, napoleon, was, superstitious, he, believed, in, omens, numerology, fate, and, lucky, stars, and, always, asked, of, his, generals, is, he, lucky, dwyer, states, that, napoleon, s, victories, at, austerlitz, and, jena, in, 1805, 06, left, him, even, more, certain, of, his, destiny, and, invincibility, i, am, of, the, race, that, founds, empires, he, once, boasted, deeming, himself, an, heir, to, the, ancient, romans, various, psychologists, have, attempted, to, explain, napoleon, s, personality, alfred, adler, cited, napoleon, to, describe, an, inferiority, complex, in, which, short, people, adopt, over, aggressive, behaviour, to, compensate, for, lack, of, height, this, inspired, the, term, napoleon, complex, adler, erich, fromm, and, wilhelm, reich, ascribed, his, nervous, energy, to, sexual, dysfunction, harold, t, parker, speculated, that, rivalry, with, his, older, brother, and, bullying, when, he, moved, to, france, led, him, to, develop, an, inferiority, complex, which, made, him, domineering, many, of, those, who, met, napoleon, were, surprised, by, his, unremarkable, physical, appearance, in, contrast, to, his, significant, deeds, and, reputation, in, his, youth, he, was, consistently, described, as, small, and, thin, english, painter, joseph, farington, who, met, him, in, 1802, said, samuel, rogers, stood, a, little, way, from, me, and, seemed, to, be, disappointed, in, the, look, of, countenance, and, said, it, was, that, of, a, little, italian, farington, said, napoleon, s, eyes, were, lighter, and, more, of, a, grey, than, i, should, have, expected, from, his, complexion, that, his, person, is, below, middle, size, and, that, his, general, aspect, was, milder, than, i, had, before, thought, it, a, friend, who, first, met, him, as, a, young, man, said, napoleon, was, only, notable, for, the, dark, color, of, his, complexion, for, his, piercing, and, scrutinising, glance, and, for, the, style, of, his, conversation, he, also, said, that, napoleon, was, serious, and, sombre, johann, ludwig, wurstemberger, who, accompanied, napoleon, in, 1797, and, 1798, noted, that, bonaparte, was, rather, slight, and, emaciated, looking, his, face, too, was, very, thin, with, a, dark, complexion, his, black, unpowdered, hair, hung, down, evenly, over, both, shoulders, but, that, despite, his, slight, and, unkempt, appearance, his, looks, and, expression, were, earnest, and, powerful, denis, davydov, considered, him, average, in, appearance, his, face, was, slightly, swarthy, with, regular, features, his, nose, was, not, very, large, but, straight, with, a, slight, hardly, noticeable, bend, the, hair, on, his, head, was, dark, reddish, blond, his, eyebrows, and, eyelashes, were, much, darker, than, the, colour, of, his, hair, and, his, blue, eyes, set, off, by, the, almost, black, lashes, gave, him, a, most, pleasing, expression, the, man, i, saw, was, of, short, stature, just, over, five, feet, tall, rather, heavy, although, he, was, only, 37, years, old, during, the, napoleonic, wars, the, british, press, depicted, napoleon, as, a, dangerous, tyrant, poised, to, invade, a, nursery, rhyme, warned, children, that, he, ate, naughty, people, the, bogeyman, he, was, mocked, as, a, short, tempered, small, man, and, was, nicknamed, little, boney, in, a, strong, fit, in, fact, at, about, 170, cm, 5, ft, 7, in, he, was, of, average, height, in, his, later, years, napoleon, gained, weight, and, had, a, sallow, complexion, novelist, paul, de, kock, who, saw, him, in, 1811, called, napoleon, yellow, obese, and, bloated, a, british, captain, who, met, him, in, 1815, stated, i, felt, very, much, disappointed, as, i, believe, everyone, else, did, in, his, appearance, he, is, fat, rather, what, we, call, pot, bellied, and, although, his, leg, is, well, shaped, it, is, rather, clumsy, he, is, very, sallow, with, light, grey, eyes, and, rather, thin, greasy, looking, brown, hair, and, altogether, a, very, nasty, priestlike, looking, fellow, he, is, often, portrayed, wearing, a, large, bicorne, hat, sideways, with, a, hand, in, waistcoat, gesture, a, reference, to, the, painting, produced, in, 1812, by, jacques, louis, david, napoleon, instituted, numerous, reforms, many, of, which, had, a, lasting, influence, on, france, europe, and, the, world, he, reformed, the, french, administration, codified, french, law, implemented, a, new, education, system, and, established, the, first, french, central, bank, the, banque, de, france, he, negotiated, the, concordat, of, 1801, with, the, catholic, church, which, sought, to, reconcile, the, majority, catholic, population, to, his, regime, it, was, presented, alongside, the, organic, articles, which, regulated, public, worship, in, france, he, also, implemented, civil, and, religious, equality, for, protestants, and, jews, in, may, 1802, he, instituted, the, legion, of, honour, to, encourage, civilian, and, military, achievements, the, order, is, still, the, highest, decoration, in, france, he, introduced, three, french, constitutions, culminating, in, the, reintroduction, of, a, hereditary, monarchy, and, nobility, napoleon, introduced, a, series, of, centralizing, administrative, reforms, soon, after, taking, power, in, 1800, he, established, prefects, appointed, to, run, france, s, regional, departments, sub, prefects, to, run, districts, and, mayors, to, run, towns, local, representative, bodies, were, retained, but, their, powers, were, reduced, and, indirect, elections, with, a, high, property, qualification, replaced, direct, elections, real, power, in, the, regions, was, now, in, the, hands, of, the, prefects, who, were, judged, by, how, they, met, the, main, priorities, of, napoleon, s, government, efficient, administration, law, and, order, stimulating, the, local, economy, gathering, votes, for, plebiscites, conscripting, soldiers, and, provisioning, the, army, an, enduring, reform, was, the, foundation, in, december, 1799, of, the, council, of, state, an, advisory, body, of, experts, which, could, also, draft, laws, for, submission, to, the, legislative, body, napoleon, drew, many, of, his, ministers, and, ambassadors, from, the, council, it, was, the, council, which, undertook, the, codification, of, french, law, after, several, attempts, by, revolutionary, governments, napoleon, officially, introduced, the, metric, system, in, france, in, 1801, and, it, was, spread, through, western, europe, by, his, armies, the, new, system, was, unpopular, in, some, circles, so, in, 1812, he, introduced, a, compromise, system, in, the, retail, trade, called, the, mesures, usuelles, traditional, units, of, measurement, in, december, 1805, napoleon, abolished, the, revolutionary, calendar, with, its, ten, day, week, which, had, been, introduced, in, 1793, napoleon, s, civil, code, of, laws, known, from, 1807, as, the, napoleonic, code, was, implemented, in, march, 1804, it, was, prepared, by, committees, of, legal, experts, under, the, supervision, of, jean, jacques, r, gis, de, cambac, r, s, the, second, consul, napoleon, participated, actively, in, the, sessions, of, the, council, of, state, that, revised, the, drafts, the, code, introduced, a, clearly, written, and, accessible, set, of, national, laws, to, replace, the, various, regional, and, customary, law, systems, that, had, operated, in, france, the, civil, code, entrenched, the, principles, of, equality, before, the, law, religious, toleration, secure, property, rights, equal, inheritance, for, all, legitimate, children, and, the, abolition, of, the, vestiges, of, feudalism, however, it, also, reduced, the, rights, of, women, and, children, and, severely, restricted, the, grounds, for, divorce, a, criminal, code, was, promulgated, in, 1808, and, eventually, seven, codes, of, law, were, produced, under, napoleon, the, napoleonic, code, was, carried, by, napoleon, s, armies, across, europe, and, influenced, the, law, in, many, parts, of, the, world, cobban, described, it, as, the, most, effective, agency, for, the, propagation, of, the, basic, principles, of, the, french, revolution, in, the, field, of, military, organization, napoleon, borrowed, from, previous, theorists, such, as, jacques, antoine, hippolyte, comte, de, guibert, and, from, the, reforms, of, preceding, french, governments, and, then, developed, what, was, already, in, place, he, continued, the, revolutionary, policies, of, conscription, and, promotion, based, primarily, on, merit, corps, replaced, divisions, as, the, largest, army, units, mobile, artillery, was, integrated, into, reserve, batteries, the, staff, system, became, more, fluid, and, cavalry, returned, as, an, important, formation, in, french, military, doctrine, these, methods, are, now, referred, to, as, essential, features, of, napoleonic, warfare, napoleon, was, regarded, by, the, influential, military, theorist, carl, von, clausewitz, as, a, genius, in, the, art, of, war, and, many, historians, rank, him, as, a, great, military, commander, wellington, considered, him, the, greatest, military, commander, of, all, time, and, henry, vassall, fox, called, him, the, greatest, statesman, and, the, ablest, general, of, ancient, or, modern, times, cobban, states, that, he, showed, his, genius, in, moving, troops, quickly, and, concentrating, them, on, strategic, points, his, principles, were, to, keep, his, forces, united, keep, no, weak, point, unguarded, seize, important, points, quickly, and, seize, his, chance, owen, connelly, however, states, napoleon, s, personal, tactics, defy, analysis, he, used, his, intuition, engaged, his, troops, and, reacted, to, what, developed, under, napoleon, the, focus, shifted, towards, destroying, enemy, armies, rather, than, simply, outmanoeuvering, them, wars, became, more, costly, and, decisive, as, invasions, of, enemy, territory, occurred, on, larger, fronts, the, political, cost, of, war, also, increased, as, defeat, for, a, european, power, now, meant, more, than, just, losing, isolated, territories, peace, terms, were, often, punitive, sometimes, involving, regime, change, which, intensified, the, trend, towards, total, war, since, the, revolutionary, era, napoleon, s, educational, reforms, laid, the, foundation, of, a, modern, system, of, secondary, and, tertiary, education, in, france, and, throughout, much, of, europe, he, synthesized, academic, elements, from, the, ancien, r, gime, the, enlightenment, and, the, revolution, his, education, laws, of, 1802, left, most, primary, education, in, the, hands, of, religious, or, communal, schools, which, taught, basic, literacy, and, numeracy, for, a, minority, of, the, population, he, abolished, the, revolutionary, central, schools, and, replaced, them, with, secondary, schools, and, elite, lyc, es, where, the, curriculum, was, based, on, reading, writing, mathematics, latin, natural, history, classics, and, ancient, history, he, retained, the, revolutionary, higher, education, system, with, grandes, coles, in, professions, including, law, medicine, pharmacy, engineering, and, school, teaching, he, introduced, grandes, coles, in, history, and, geography, but, opposed, one, in, literature, because, it, was, not, vocational, he, also, founded, the, military, academy, of, saint, cyr, he, promoted, the, advanced, centres, such, as, the, cole, polytechnique, that, provided, both, military, expertise, and, advanced, research, in, science, in, 1808, he, founded, the, imperial, university, a, supervisory, body, with, control, over, curriculum, and, discipline, the, following, year, he, introduced, the, baccalaureate, the, system, was, designed, to, produce, the, efficient, bureaucrats, technicians, professionals, and, military, officers, that, the, napoleonic, state, required, it, outperformed, its, european, counterparts, many, of, which, borrowed, from, the, french, system, female, education, in, contrast, was, designed, to, be, practical, and, religious, based, on, home, science, the, catechism, basic, literacy, and, numeracy, and, enough, science, to, eradicate, superstition, there, is, debate, over, whether, napoleon, was, an, enlightened, despot, who, laid, the, foundations, of, modern, europe, or, a, megalomaniac, who, wrought, greater, misery, than, any, man, before, the, coming, of, hitler, he, was, compared, to, adolf, hitler, by, pieter, geyl, in, 1947, and, claude, ribbe, in, 2005, most, modern, critics, of, napoleon, however, reject, the, hitler, comparison, arguing, that, napoleon, did, not, commit, genocide, and, did, not, engage, in, the, mass, murder, and, imprisonment, of, his, political, opponents, nevertheless, bell, and, mclynn, condemn, his, killing, of, 3, 000, 5, 000, turkish, prisoners, of, war, in, syria, a, number, of, historians, have, argued, that, his, expansionist, foreign, policy, was, a, major, factor, in, the, napoleonic, wars, which, cost, six, million, lives, and, caused, economic, disruption, for, a, generation, mclynn, and, barnett, suggest, that, napoleon, s, reputation, as, a, military, genius, is, exaggerated, cobban, and, conner, argue, that, napoleon, had, insufficient, regard, for, the, lives, of, his, soldiers, and, that, his, battle, tactics, led, to, excessive, casualties, critics, also, cite, napoleon, s, exploitation, of, conquered, territories, to, finance, his, wars, napoleon, increased, taxes, and, levies, of, troops, from, annexed, territories, and, satellite, states, he, also, introduced, discriminatory, tariff, policies, which, promoted, french, trade, at, the, expense, of, allies, and, satellite, states, he, institutionalized, plunder, french, museums, contain, art, stolen, by, napoleon, s, forces, from, across, europe, artefacts, were, brought, to, the, mus, e, du, louvre, for, a, grand, central, museum, an, example, which, would, later, be, followed, by, others, many, historians, have, criticized, napoleon, s, authoritarian, rule, especially, after, 1807, which, included, censorship, the, closure, of, independent, newspapers, the, bypassing, of, direct, elections, and, representative, government, the, dismissal, of, judges, showing, independence, and, the, exile, of, critics, of, the, regime, historians, also, blame, napoleon, for, reducing, the, civil, rights, of, women, children, and, people, of, colour, and, reintroducing, the, legal, penalties, of, civil, death, and, confiscation, of, property, his, reintroduction, of, an, hereditary, monarchy, and, nobility, remains, controversial, his, role, in, the, haitian, revolution, and, decision, to, reinstate, slavery, in, france, s, colonies, in, the, caribbean, and, indian, ocean, adversely, affect, his, reputation, napoleon, s, use, of,

were, part, of, his, propaganda, scheme, aimed, at, portraying, him, as, bringing, peace, and, stability, to, france, propaganda, focused, on, his, role, first, as, a, general, then, as, a, civil, leader, and, emperor, he, fostered, a, relationship, with, artists, commissioning, and, controlling, different, forms, of, art, to, suit, his, propaganda, goals, napoleonic, propaganda, survived, his, exile, to, saint, helena, las, cases, who, was, with, napoleon, in, exile, published, the, memorial, of, saint, helena, in, 1822, creating, a, legend, of, napoleon, as, a, liberal, visionary, proponent, of, european, unification, deposed, by, reactionary, elements, of, the, ancien, r, gime, napoleon, remained, a, central, figure, in, the, romantic, art, and, literature, of, the, 1820s, and, 1830s, the, napoleonic, legend, played, a, key, role, in, collective, political, defiance, of, the, bourbon, restoration, monarchy, in, 1815, 1830, people, from, different, walks, of, life, and, areas, of, france, particularly, napoleonic, veterans, drew, on, the, napoleonic, legacy, and, its, connections, with, the, ideals, of, the, 1789, revolution, the, defiance, manifested, itself, in, seditious, materials, displaying, the, tricolour, and, rosettes, there, were, also, subversive, activities, celebrating, anniversaries, of, napoleon, s, life, and, reign, and, disrupting, royal, celebrations, bell, sees, the, return, of, napoleon, s, remains, to, france, in, 1840, as, an, attempt, by, louis, phillipe, to, prop, up, his, unpopular, regime, by, associating, it, with, napoleon, and, that, the, regime, of, napoleon, iii, was, only, possible, due, to, the, continued, resonance, of, the, napoleonic, legend, venita, datta, argues, that, following, the, collapse, of, militaristic, boulangism, in, the, late, 1880s, the, napoleonic, legend, was, divorced, from, party, politics, and, revived, in, popular, culture, writers, and, critics, of, the, belle, poque,
