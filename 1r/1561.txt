frank, in, their, discussion, of, sexuality, and, many, new, york, call, readers, were, outraged, by, them, other, readers, however, praised, the, series, for, its, candor, one, stated, that, the, series, contained, a, purer, morality, than, whole, libraries, full, of, hypocritical, cant, about, modesty, 65, both, were, published, in, book, form, in, 1916, during, her, work, among, working, class, immigrant, women, sanger, met, women, who, underwent, frequent, childbirth, miscarriages, and, self, induced, abortions, for, lack, of, information, on, how, to, avoid, unwanted, pregnancy,

visited, public, libraries, but, was, unable, to, find, information, on, contraception, these, problems, were, epitomized, in, a, story, that, sanger, would, later, recount, in, her, speeches, while, sanger, was, working, as, a, nurse, she, was, called, to, the, apartment, of, a, woman, sadie, sachs, who, had, become, extremely, ill, due, to, a, self, induced, abortion, afterward, sadie, begged, the, attending, doctor, to, tell, her, how, she, could, prevent, this, from, happening, again, to, which, the, doctor, simply, advised, her, to, remain, abstinent, his, exact, words, and, actions, apparently, were, to, laugh, and, say, you, want, your, cake, while, you, eat, it, too, do, you, well, it, can, t, be, done, i, ll, tell, you, the, only, sure, thing, to, do, tell, jake, to, sleep,

induced, abortion, sanger, would, sometimes, end, the, story, by, saying, i, threw, my, nursing, bag, in, the, corner, and, announced, that, i, would, never, take, another, case, until, i, had, made, it, possible, for, working, women, in, america, to, have, the, knowledge, to, control, birth, biographer, ellen, chesler, concluded, that, sachs, may, have, been, an, imaginative, dramatic, composite, 63, this, story, along, with, sanger, s, 1904, rescue, of, her, unwanted, niece, olive, byrne, from, the, snowbank, in, which, she, had, been, left, marks, the, beginning, of, sanger, s, commitment, to, spare, women, from, the, pursuit, of, dangerous, and, illegal, abortions, sanger, opposed, abortion, but, primarily, as, a, societal, ill, and, public, health, danger, which, would, disappear, if, women, were, able, to, prevent, unwanted, pregnancy, given, the, connection, between, contraception, and, working, class, empowerment, sanger, came, to, believe, that, only, by, liberating, women, from, the, risk, of, unwanted, pregnancy, would, fundamental, social, change, take, place, she, launched, a, campaign, to, challenge, governmental, censorship, of, contraceptive, information, through, confrontational, actions, sanger, became, estranged, from, her, husband, in, 1913, and, the, couple, s, divorce, was, finalized, in, 1921, in, 1920, 21, and, intermittently, until, his, death, in,

eight, page, monthly, newsletter, which, promoted, contraception, using, the, slogan, no, gods, no, masters, sanger, collaborating, with, anarchist, friends, popularized, the, term, birth, control, as, a, more, candid, alternative, to, euphemisms, such, as, family, limitation, the, term, birth, control, was, suggested, in, 1914, by, a, young, friend, called, otto, bobstei, 97, sanger, proclaimed, that, each, woman, should, be, the, absolute, mistress, of, her, own, body, in, these, early, years, of, sanger, s, activism, she, viewed, birth, control, as, a, free, speech, issue, and, when, she, started, publishing, the, woman, rebel, one, of, her, goals, was, to, provoke, a, legal, challenge, to, the, federal, anti, obscenity, laws, which, banned, dissemination, of, information, about, contraception, though, postal, authorities, suppressed, five, of, its, seven, issues, sanger, continued, publication, all, the, while, preparing, family, limitation, another, challenge, to, anti, birth, control, laws, this, 16, page, pamphlet, contained, detailed, and, precise, information, and, graphic, descriptions, of, various, contraceptive, methods, in, august, 1914, margaret, sanger, was, indicted, for, violating, postal, obscenity, laws, by, sending, the, woman, rebel, through, the, postal, system, rather, than, stand, trial, she, fled, the, country, margaret, sanger, spent, much, of, her, 1914, exile, in, england, where, contact, with, british, neo, malthusians, such, as, charles, vickery, drysdale, helped, refine, her, socioeconomic, justifications, for, birth, control, she, shared, their, concern, that, over, population, led, to, poverty, famine, and, war, at, the, fifth, international, neo, malthusian, conference, in, 1922, she, was, the, first, woman, to, chair, a, session, she, organized, the, sixth, international, neo, malthusian, and, birth, control, conference, that, took, place, in, new, york, in, 1925, 225, over, population, would, remain, a, concern, of, hers, for, the, rest, of, her, life, during, her, 1914, trip, to, england, she, was, also, profoundly, influenced, by, the, liberation, theories, of, havelock, ellis, under, whose, tutelage, she, sought, not, just, to, make, sexual, intercourse, safer, for, women, but, more, pleasurable, around, this, time, she, met, marie, stopes, who, had, run, into, sanger, after, she, had, just, given, a, talk, on, birth, control, at, a, fabian, society, meeting, stopes, showed, sanger, her, writings, and, sought, her, advice, about, a, chapter, on, contraception, early, in, 1915, margaret, sanger, s, estranged, husband, william, sanger, gave, a, copy, of, family, limitation, to, a, representative, of, anti, vice, politician, anthony, comstock, william, sanger, was, tried, and, convicted, spending, thirty, days, in, jail, while, attracting, interest, in, birth, control, as, an, issue, of, civil, liberty, margaret, s, second, husband, noah, slee, also, lent, his, help, to, her, life, s, work, in, 1928, slee, would, smuggle, diaphragms, into, new, york, through, canada, 255, in, boxes, labeled, as, 3, in, one, oil, he, later, became, the, first, legal, manufacturer, of, diaphragms, in, the, united, states, some, countries, in, northwestern, europe, had, more, liberal, policies, towards, contraception, than, the, united, states, at, the, time, and, when, sanger, visited, a, dutch, birth, control, clinic, in, 1915, she, learned, about, diaphragms, and, became, convinced, that, they, were, a, more, effective, means, of, contraception, than, the, suppositories, and, douches, that, she, had, been, distributing, back, in, the, united, states, diaphragms, were, generally, unavailable, in, the, united, states, so, sanger, and, others, began, importing, them, from, europe, in, defiance, of, united, states, law, on, october, 16, 1916, sanger, opened, a, family, planning, and, birth, control, clinic, at, 46, amboy, street, in, the, brownsville, neighborhood, of, brooklyn, the, first, of, its, kind, in, the, united, states, nine, days, after, the, clinic, opened, sanger, was, arrested, sanger, s, bail, was, set, at, 500, and, she, went, back, home, sanger, continued, seeing, some, women, in, the, clinic, until, the, police, came, a, second, time, this, time, sanger, and, her, sister, ethel, byrne, were, arrested, for, breaking, a, new, york, state, law, that, prohibited, distribution, of, contraceptives, sanger, was, also, charged, with, running, a, public, nuisance, sanger, and, byrne, went, to, trial, in, january, 1917, byrne, was, convicted, and,

that, byrne, would, never, break, the, law, was, she, pardoned, after, ten, days, sanger, was, convicted, the, trial, judge, held, that, women, did, not, have, the, right, to, copulate, with, a, feeling, of, security, that, there, will, be, no, resulting, conception, sanger, was, offered, a, more, lenient, sentence, if, she, promised, to, not, break, the, law, again, but, she, replied, i, cannot, respect, the, law, as, it, exists, today, for, this, she, was, sentenced, to, 30, days, in, a, workhouse, an, initial, appeal, was, rejected, but, in, a, subsequent, court, proceeding, in, 1918, the, birth, control, movement, won, a, victory, when, judge, frederick, e, crane, of, the, new, york, court, of, appeals, issued, a, ruling, which, allowed, doctors, to, prescribe, contraception, the, publicity, surrounding, sanger, s, arrest, trial, and, appeal, sparked, birth, control, activism, across, the, united, states, and, earned, the, support, of, numerous, donors, who, would, provide, her, with, funding, and, support, for, future, endeavors, in, february, 1917, sanger, began, publishing, the, monthly, periodical, birth, control, review, after, world, war, i, sanger, shifted, away, from, radical, politics, and, she, founded, the, american, birth, control, league, abcl, in, 1921, to, enlarge, her, base, of, supporters, to, include, the, middle, class, the, founding, principles, of, the, abcl, were, as, follows, we, hold, that, children, should, be, 1, conceived, in, love, 2, born, of, the, mother, s, conscious, desire, 3, and, only, begotten, under, conditions, which, render, possible, the, heritage, of, health, therefore, we, hold, that, every, woman, must, possess, the, power, and, freedom, to, prevent, conception, except, when, these, conditions, can, be, satisfied, after, sanger, s, appeal, of, her, conviction, for, the, brownsville, clinic, secured, a, 1918, court, ruling, that, exempted, physicians, from, the, law, prohibiting, the, distribution, of, contraceptive, information, to, women, provided, it, was, prescribed, for, medical, reason, she, established, the, clinical, research, bureau, crb, in, 1923, to, exploit, this,

of, family, planning, was, female, infanticide, and, she, later, worked, with, pearl, buck, to, establish, a, family, planning, clinic, in, shanghai, her, visit, fueled, the, belief, among, elites, in, nationalist, era, china, that, the, use, of, contraception, would, improve, the, quality, of, the, chinese, people, 10, and, resulted, in, many, newspaper, articles, addressing, the, benefits, and, shortcomings, of, birth, control, 24, also, following, sanger, s, visit, a, wide, range, of, texts, on, birth, control, and, population, issues, were, imported, into, china, 24, chinese, feminists, inspired, by, sanger, s, visit, went, on, to, be, significantly, involved, in, the, subsequent, chinese, debates, on, birth, control, and, eugenics, 28, sanger, introduced, carbizone, birth, control, tablets, to, china, 58, during, the, visit, sanger, encouraged, the, use, of, female, birth, control, in, part, because, of, her, view, that, frequent, use, of, condoms, or, the, withdrawal, method, would, cause, men, to, develop, nervous, disorders, 64, sanger, also, visited, korea, and, japan, sanger, ultimately, visited, japan, six, times, working, with, japanese, feminist, kato, shidzue, to, promote, birth, control, in, 1928, conflict, within, the, birth, control, movement, leadership, led, sanger, to, resign, as, the, president, of, the, abcl, and, take, full, control, of, the, crb, renaming, it, the, birth, control, clinical, research, bureau, bccrb, marking, the, beginning, of, a, schism, that, would, last, until, 1938, sanger, invested, a, great, deal, of, effort, communicating, with, the, general, public, from, 1916, onward, she, frequently, lectured, in, churches, women, s, clubs, homes, and, theaters, to, workers, churchmen, liberals, socialists,

autobiography, she, justified, her, decision, to, address, them, by, writing, always, to, me, any, aroused, group, was, a, good, group, meaning, that, she, was, willing, to, seek, common, ground, with, anyone, who, might, help, promote, legalization, and, awareness, of, birth, control, she, described, the, experience, as, weird, and, reported, that, she, had, the, impression, that, the, audience, were, all, half, wits, and, therefore, spoke, to, them, in, the, simplest, possible, language, as, if, she, were, talking, to, children, she, wrote, several, books, in, the, 1920s, which, had, a, nationwide, impact, in, promoting, the, cause, of, birth, control, between, 1920, and, 1926, 567, 000, copies, of, woman, and, the, new, race, and, the, pivot, of, civilization, were, sold,

was, not, able, to, attend, his, margaret, sanger, award, ceremony, in, may, 1966, mrs, king, read, her, husband, s, acceptance, speech, that, praised, sanger, but, first, said, her, own, words, because, of, dedication, her, deep, convictions, and, for, her, suffering, for, what, she, believed, in, i, would, like, to, say, that, i, am, proud, to, be, a, woman, tonight, from, 1939, to, 1942, sanger, was, an, honorary, delegate, of, the, birth, control, federation, of, america, which, included, a, supervisory, role, alongside, mary, lasker, and, clarence, gamble, in, the, negro, project, an, effort, to, deliver, information, about, birth, control, to, poor, black, people, sanger, advised, gamble, on, the, utility, of, hiring, a, black, physician, for, the, negro, project, she, also, advised, him, on, the, importance, of, reaching, out, to, black, ministers, writing, the, ministers, work, is, also, important, and, also, he, should, be, trained, perhaps, by, the, federation, as, to, our, ideals, and, the, goal, that, we, hope, to, reach, we, do, not, want, word, to, go, out, that, we, want, to, exterminate, the, negro, population, and, the, minister, is, the, man, who, can, straighten, out, that, idea, if, it, ever, occurs, to, any, of, their, more, rebellious, members, new, york, university, s, margaret, sanger, papers, project, says, that, though, the, letter, would, have, been, meant, to, avoid, the, mistaken, notion, that, the, negro, project, was, a, racist, campaign, detractors, of, sanger, such, as, angela, davis, have, interpreted, the, passage, as, evidence, that, she, led, a, calculated, effort, to, reduce, the, black, population, against, its, will, others, such, as, charles, valenza, state, that, this, notion, is, based, on, a, misreading, of, sanger, s, words, he, believes, that, sanger, wanted, to, overcome, the, fear, of, some, black, people, that, birth, control, was, the, white, man, s, way, of, reducing, the, black, population, in, 1929, sanger, formed, the, national, committee, on, federal, legislation, for, birth, control, in, order, to, lobby, for, legislation, to, overturn, restrictions, on, contraception, that, effort, failed, to, achieve, success, so, sanger, ordered, a, diaphragm, from, japan, in, 1932, in, order, to, provoke, a, decisive, battle, in, the, courts, the, diaphragm, was, confiscated, by, the, united, states, government, and, sanger, s, subsequent, legal, challenge, led, to, a, 1936, court, decision, which, overturned, an, important, provision, of, the, comstock, laws, which, prohibited, physicians, from, obtaining, contraceptives, this, court, victory, motivated, the, american, medical, association, in, 1937, to, adopt, contraception, as, a, normal, medical, service, and, a, key, component, of, medical, school, curriculums, this, 1936, contraception, court, victory, was, the, culmination, of, sanger, s, birth, control, efforts, and, she, took, the, opportunity, now, in, her, late, 50s, to, move, to, tucson, arizona, intending, to, play, a, less, critical, role, in, the, birth, control, movement, in, spite, of, her, original, intentions, she, remained, active, in, the, movement, through, the, 1950s, in, 1937, sanger, became, chairman, of, the, newly, formed, birth, control, council, of, america, and, attempted, to, resolve, the, schism, between, the, abcl, and, the, bccrb, her, efforts, were, successful, and, the, two, organizations, merged, in, 1939, as, the, birth, control, federation, of, america, although, sanger, continued, in, the, role, of, president, she, no, longer, wielded, the, same, power, as, she, had, in, the, early, years, of, the, movement, and, in, 1942, more, conservative, forces, within, the, organization, changed, the, name, to, planned, parenthood, federation, of, america, a, name, sanger, objected, to, because, she, considered, it, too, euphemistic, 393, in, 1948, sanger, helped, found, the, international, committee, on, planned, parenthood, which, evolved, into, the, international, planned, parenthood, federation, in, 1952, and, soon, became, the, world, s, largest, non, governmental, international, women, s, health, family, planning, and, birth, control, organization, sanger, was, the, organization, s, first, president, and, served, in, that, role, until, she, was, 80, years, old, in, the, early, 1950s, sanger, encouraged, philanthropist, katharine, mccormick, to, provide, funding, for, biologist, gregory, pincus, to, develop, the, birth, control, pill, which, was, eventually, sold, under, the, name, enovid, pincus, had, recruited, john, rock, harvard, gynecologist, to, investigate, clinical, use, of, progesterone, to, prevent, ovulation, jonathan, eig, 2014, the, birth, of, the, pill, how, four,

mccormick, and, rock, ibid, p, 312, sanger, died, of, congestive, heart, failure, in, 1966, in, tucson, arizona, aged, 86, about, a, year, after, the, u, s, supreme, court, s, landmark, decision, in, griswold, v, connecticut, which, legalized, birth, control, in, the, united, states, sanger, called, herself, an, episcopalian, by, religion, and, her, funeral, was, held, at, st, philip, s, in, the, hills, episcopal, church, sanger, is, buried, in, fishkill, new, york, next, to, her, sister, nan, higgins, and, her, second, husband, noah, slee, one, of, her, surviving, brothers, was, college, football, hall, of, fame, player, and, pennsylvania, state, university, head, football, coach, bob, higgins, while, researching, information, on, contraception, sanger, read, treatises, on, sexuality, including, the, psychology, of, sex, by, the, english, psychologist, havelock, ellis, and, was, heavily, influenced, by, it, while, traveling, in, europe, in, 1914, sanger, met, ellis, influenced, by, ellis, sanger, adopted, his, view, of, sexuality, as, a, powerful, liberating, force, 13, 14, this, view, provided, another, argument, in, favor, of, birth, control, because, it, would, enable, women, to, fully, enjoy, sexual, relations, without, fear, of, unwanted, pregnancy, 111, 117, sanger, also, believed, that, sexuality, along, with, birth, control, should, be, discussed, with, more, candor, 13, 14, and, praised, ellis, for, his, efforts, in, this, direction, she, also, blamed, christianity, for, the, suppression, of, such, discussions, sanger, opposed, excessive, sexual, indulgence, she, wrote, that, every, normal, man, and, woman, has, the, power, to, control, and, direct, his, sexual, impulse, men, and, women, who, have, it, in, control, and, constantly, use, their, brain, cells, thinking, deeply, are, never, sensual, sanger, said, that, birth, control, would, elevate, women, away, from, the, position, of, being, objects, of, lust, and, elevate, sex, away, from, an, activity, that, was, purely, being, engaged, in, for, the, purpose, of, satisfying, lust, saying, that, birth, control, denies, that, sex, should, be, reduced, to, the, position, of, sensual, lust, or, that, woman, should, permit, herself, to, be, the, instrument, of, its, satisfaction, sanger, wrote, that, masturbation, was, dangerous, she, stated, in, my, personal, experience, as, a, trained, nurse, while, attending, persons, afflicted, with, various, and, often, revolting, diseases, no, matter, what, their, ailments, i, never, found, anyone, so, repulsive, as, the, chronic, masturbator, it, would, not, be, difficult, to, fill, page, upon, page, of, heart, rending, confessions, made, by, young, girls, whose, lives, were, blighted, by, this, pernicious, habit, always, begun, so, innocently, she, believed, that, women, had, the, ability, to, control, their, sexual, impulses, and, should, utilize, that, control, to, avoid, sex, outside, of, relationships, marked, by, confidence, and, respect, she, believed, that, exercising, such, control, would, lead, to, the, strongest, and, most, sacred, passion, sanger, maintained, links, with, affiliates, of, the, british, society, for, the, study, of, sex, psychology, which, contained, a, number, of, high, profile, gay, men, and, sexual, reformers, as, members, and, gave, a, speech, to, the, group, on, the, issue, of, sexual, continence, she, later, praised, ellis, for, clarifying, the, question, of, homosexuals, making, the, thing, a, not, exactly, a, perverted, thing, but, a, thing, that, a, person, is, born, with, different, kinds, of, eyes, different, kinds, of, structures, and, so, forth, that, he, didn, t, make, all, homosexuals, perverts, and, i, thought, he, helped, clarify, that, to, the, medical, profession, and, to, the, scientists, of, the, world, as, perhaps, one, of, the, first, ones, to, do, that, sanger, opposed, censorship, throughout, her, career, sanger, grew, up, in, a, home, where, orator, robert, ingersoll, was, admired, during, the, early, years, of, her, activism, sanger, viewed, birth, control, primarily, as, a, free, speech, issue, rather, than, as, a, feminist, issue, and, when, she, started, publishing, the, woman, rebel, in, 1914, she, did, so, with, the, express, goal, of, provoking, a, legal, challenge, to, the, comstock, laws, banning, dissemination, of, information, about, contraception, in, new, york, emma, goldman, introduced, sanger, to, members, of, the, free, speech, league, such, as, edward, bliss, foote, and, theodore, schroeder, and, subsequently, the, league, provided, funding, and, advice, to, help, sanger, with, legal, battles, over, the, course, of, her, career, sanger, was, arrested, at, least, eight, times, for, expressing, her, views, during, an, era, in, which, speaking, publicly, about, contraception, was, illegal, numerous, times, in, her, career, local, government, officials, prevented, sanger, from, speaking, by, shuttering, a, facility, or, threatening, her, hosts, in, boston, in, 1929, city, officials, under, the, leadership, of, james, curley, threatened, to, arrest, her, if, she, spoke, in, response, she, stood, on, stage, silent, with, a, gag, over, her, mouth, while, her, speech, was, read, by, arthur, m, schlesinger, sr, after, world, war, i, sanger, increasingly, posited, a, societal, need, to, limit, births, by, those, least, able, to, afford, children, the, affluent, and, educated, already, limited, their, childbearing, while, the, poor, and, uneducated, lacked, access, to, contraception, and, information, about, birth, control, here, she, found, an, area, of, overlap, with, eugenicists, she, believed, that, they, both, sought, to, assist, the, race, toward, the, elimination, of, the, unfit, she, distinguished, herself, from, other, eugenicists, by, writing, eugenists, imply, or, insist, that, a, woman, s, first, duty, is, to, the, state, we, contend, that, her, duty, to, herself, is, her, duty, to, the, state, we, maintain, that, a, woman, possessing, an, adequate, knowledge, of, her, reproductive, functions, is, the, best, judge, of, the, time, and, conditions, under, which, her, child, should, be, brought, into, the, world, we, further, maintain, that, it, is, her, right, regardless, of, all, other, considerations, to, determine, whether, she, shall, bear, children, or, not, and, how, many, children, she, shall, bear, if, she, chooses, to, become, a, mother, sanger, was, a, proponent, of, negative, eugenics, which, aimed, to, improve, human, hereditary, traits, through, social, intervention, by, reducing, the, reproduction, of, those, who, were, considered, unfit, sanger, s, view, of, eugenics, was, influenced, by, havelock, ellis, and, other, british, eugenicists, including, h, g, wells, with, whom, she, formed, a, close, lasting, friendship, she, did, not, speak, specifically, to, the, idea, of, race, or, ethnicity, being, determining, factors, and, although, sanger, articulated, birth, control, in, terms, of, racial, betterment, and, like, most, old, stock, americans, supported, restricted, immigration, she, always, defined, fitness, in, individual, rather, than, racial, terms, 195, 6, instead, she, stressed, limiting, the, number, of, births, to, live, within, one, s, economic, ability, to, raise, and, support, healthy, children, this, would, lead, to, a, betterment, of, society, and, the, human, race, sanger, s, view, put, her, at, odds, with, leading, american, eugenicists, such, as, charles, davenport, who, took, a, racist, view, of, inherited, traits, while, sanger, didn, t, explicitly, traffic, in, racist, language, in, his, a, history, of, the, birth, control, movement, in, america, associate, editor, of, nyu, s, margaret, sanger, papers, project, peter, c, engelman, noted, that, sanger, quite, effortlessly, looked, the, other, way, when, others, spouted, racist, speech, she, had, no, reservations, about, relying, on, flawed, and, overtly, racist, works, to, serve, her, own, propaganda, needs, sanger, was, supported, by, one, of, the, most, racist, authors, in, america, in, the, 1920s, the, klansman, lothrop, stoddard, who, was, a, founding, member, of, the, board, of, directors, of, sanger, s, american, birth, control, league, biographer, ellen, chesler, commented, margaret, sanger, was, never, herself, a, racist, but, she, lived, in, a, profoundly, bigoted, society, and, her, failure, to, repudiate, prejudice, unequivocally, especially, when, it, was, manifest, among, proponents, of, her, cause, has, haunted, her, ever, since, 15, in, the, morality, of, birth, control, a, 1921, speech, she, divided, society, into, three, groups, the, educated, and, informed, class, that, regulated, the, size, of, their, families, the, intelligent, and, responsible, who, desired, to, control, their, families, in, spite, of, lacking, the, means, or, the, knowledge, and, the, irresponsible, and, reckless, people, whose, religious, scruples, prevent, their, exercising, control, over, their, numbers, sanger, concludes, there, is, no, doubt, in, the, minds, of, all, thinking, people, that, the, procreation, of, this, group, should, be, stopped, sanger, s, eugenics, policies, included, an, exclusionary, immigration, policy, free, access, to, birth, control, methods, and, full, family, planning, autonomy, for, the, able, minded, as, well, as, compulsory, segregation, or, sterilization, for, the, profoundly, retarded, sanger, wrote, we, believe, that, the, community, could, or, should, send, to, the, lethal, chamber, the, defective, progeny, resulting, from, irresponsible, and, unintelligent, breeding, in, the, pivot, of, civilization, she, criticized, certain, charity, organizations, for, providing, free, obstetric, and, immediate, post, birth, care, to, indigent, women, without, also, providing, information, about, birth, control, nor, any, assistance, in, raising, or, educating, the, children, by, such, charities, she, wrote, the, poor, woman, is, taught, how, to, have, her, seventh, child, when, what, she, wants, to, know, is, how, to, avoid, bringing, into, the, world, her, eighth, in, personal, correspondence, she, expressed, her, sadness, about, the, aggressive, and, lethal, nazi, eugenics, program, and, donated, to, the, american, council, against, nazi, propaganda, sanger, believed, that, self, determining, motherhood, was, the, only, unshakable, foundation, for, racial, betterment, initially, she, advocated, that, the, responsibility, for, birth, control, should, remain, with, able, minded, individual, parents, rather, than, the, state, later, she, proposed, that, permits, for, parenthood, shall, be, issued, upon, application, by, city, county, or, state, authorities, to, married, couples, but, added, that, the, requirement, should, be, implemented, by, state, advocacy, and, reward, for, complying, not, enforced, by, punishing, anyone, for, violating, it, sanger, opposed, abortion, and, sharply, distinguished, it, from, birth, control, she, believed, that, the, latter, is, a, fundamental, right, of, women, and, the, former, is, a, shameful, crime, 125, 36, 37, in, 1916, when, she, opened, her, first, birth, control, clinic, she, was, employing, harsh, rhetoric, against, abortion, flyers, she, distributed, to, women, exhorted, them, in, all, capitals, do, not, kill, do, not, take, life, but, prevent, 155, sanger, s, patients, at, that, time, were, told, that, abortion, was, the, wrong, way, no, matter, how, early, it, was, performed, it, was, taking, life, that, contraception, was, the, better, way, the, safer, way, it, took, a, little, time, a, little, trouble, but, it, was, well, worth, while, in, the, long, run, because, life, had, not, yet, begun, 217, sanger, consistently, distanced, herself, from, any, calls, for, legal, access, to, abortion, arguing, that, legal, access, to, contraceptives, would, remove, the, need, for, abortion, ann, hibner, koblitz, has, argued, that, sanger, s, anti, abortion, stance, contributed, to, the, further, stigmatization, of, abortion, and, impeded, the, growth, of, the, broader, reproductive, rights, movement, 182, 188, while, sanger, condemned, abortion, as, a, method, of, family, limitation, she, was, not, opposed, to, abortion, intended, to, save, a, woman, s, life, furthermore, in, 1932, sanger, directed, the, clinical, research, bureau, to, start, referring, patients, to, hospitals, for, therapeutic, abortions, when, indicated, by, an, examining, physician, 300, 301, she, also, advocated, for, birth, control, so, that, the, pregnancies, that, led, to, therapeutic, abortions, could, be, prevented, in, the, first, place, sanger, s,
