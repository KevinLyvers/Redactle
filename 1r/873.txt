edward, lee, thorndike, august, 31, 1874, august, 9, 1949, was, an, american, psychologist, who, spent, nearly, his, entire, career, at, teachers, college, columbia, university, his, work, on, comparative, psychology, and, the, learning, process, led, to, his, theory, of, connectionism, and, helped, lay, the, scientific, foundation, for, educational, psychology, he, also, worked, on, solving, industrial, problems, such, as, employee, exams, and, testing, thorndike, was, a, member, of, the, board, of, the, psychological, corporation, and, served, as, president, of, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1912, a, review, of, general, psychology, survey, published, in, 2002, ranked, thorndike, as, the, ninth, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, edward, thorndike, had, a, powerful, impact, on, reinforcement, theory, and, behavior, analysis, providing, the, basic, framework, for, empirical, laws, in, behavior, psychology, with, his, law, of, effect, through, his, contributions, to, the, behavioral, psychology, field, came, his, major, impacts, on, education, where, the, law, of, effect, has, great, influence, in, the, classroom, thorndike, born, in, williamsburg, massachusetts, was, the, son, of, edward, r, and, abbie, b, thorndike, a, methodist, minister, in, lowell, massachusetts, thorndike, graduated, from, the, roxbury, latin, school, 1891, in, west, roxbury, massachusetts, and, from, wesleyan, university, b, s, 1895, he, earned, an, m, a, at, harvard, university, in, 1897, his, two, brothers, lynn, and, ashley, also, became, important, scholars, the, younger, lynn, was, a, medievalist, specializing, in, the, history, of, science, and, magic, while, the, older, ashley, was, an, english, professor, and, noted, authority, on, shakespeare, while, at, harvard, he, was, interested, in, how, animals, learn, ethology, and, worked, with, william, james, afterwards, he, became, interested, in, the, animal, man, to, the, study, of, which, he, then, devoted, his, life, edward, s, thesis, is, sometimes, thought, of, as, the, essential, document, of, modern, comparative, psychology, upon, graduation, thorndike, returned, to, his, initial, interest, educational, psychology, in, 1898, he, completed, his, phd, at, columbia, university, under, the, supervision, of, james, mckeen, cattell, one, of, the, founding, fathers, of, psychometrics, in, 1899, after, a, year, of, unhappy, initial, employment, at, the, college, for, women, of, case, western, reserve, in, cleveland, ohio, he, became, an, instructor, in, psychology, at, teachers, college, at, columbia, university, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, career, studying, human, learning, education, and, mental, testing, in, 1937, thorndike, became, the, second, president, of, the, psychometric, society, following, in, the, footsteps, of, louis, leon, thurstone, who, had, established, the, society, and, its, journal, psychometrika, the, previous, year, on, august, 29, 1900, he, wed, elizabeth, moulton, they, had, four, children, among, them, frances, who, became, a, mathematician, during, the, early, stages, of, his, career, he, purchased, a, wide, tract, of, land, on, the, hudson, and, encouraged, other, researchers, to, settle, around, him, soon, a, colony, had, formed, there, with, him, as, its, tribal, chief, thorndike, was, a, pioneer, not, only, in, behaviorism, and, in, studying, learning, but, also, in, using, animals, in, clinical, experiments, thorndike, was, able, to, create, a, theory, of, learning, based, on, his, research, with, animals, his, doctoral, dissertation, animal, intelligence, an, experimental, study, of, the, associative, processes, in, animals, was, the, first, in, psychology, where, the, subjects, were, nonhumans, thorndike, was, interested, in, whether, animals, could, learn, tasks, through, imitation, or, observation, to, test, this, thorndike, created, puzzle, boxes, the, puzzle, boxes, were, approximately, 20, inches, long, 15, inches, wide, and, 12, inches, tall, each, box, had, a, door, that, was, pulled, open, by, a, weight, attached, to, a, string, that, ran, over, a, pulley, and, was, attached, to, the, door, the, string, attached, to, the, door, led, to, a, lever, or, button, inside, the, box, when, the, animal, pressed, the, bar, or, pulled, the, lever, the, string, attached, to, the, door, would, cause, the, weight, to, lift, and, the, door, to, open, thorndike, s, puzzle, boxes, were, arranged, so, that, the, animal, would, be, required, to, perform, a, certain, response, pulling, a, lever, or, pushing, a, button, while, he, measured, the, amount, of, time, it, took, them, to, escape, once, the, animal, had, performed, the, desired, response, they, were, allowed, to, escape, and, were, also, given, a, reward, usually, food, thorndike, primarily, used, cats, in, his, puzzle, boxes, when, the, cats, were, put, into, the, cages, they, would, wander, restlessly, and, meow, but, they, did, not, know, how, to, escape, eventually, the, cats, would, step, on, the, switch, on, the, floor, by, chance, and, the, door, would, open, to, see, if, the, cats, could, learn, through, observation, he, had, them, observe, other, animals, escaping, from, the, box, he, would, then, compare, the, times, of, those, who, got, to, observe, others, escaping, with, those, who, did, not, and, he, found, that, there, was, no, difference, in, their, rate, of, learning, thorndike, saw, the, same, results, with, other, animals, and, he, observed, that, there, was, no, improvement, even, when, he, placed, the, animals, paws, on, the, correct, levers, buttons, or, bar, these, failures, led, him, to, fall, back, on, a, trial, and, error, explanation, of, learning, he, found, that, after, accidentally, stepping, on, the, switch, once, they, would, press, the, switch, faster, in, each, succeeding, trial, inside, the, puzzle, box, by, observing, and, recording, the, animals, escapes, and, escape, times, thorndike, was, able, to, graph, the, times, it, took, for, the, animals, in, each, trial, to, escape, resulting, in, a, learning, curve, the, animals, had, difficulty, escaping, at, first, but, eventually, caught, on, and, escaped, faster, and, faster, with, each, successive, puzzle, box, trial, until, they, eventually, leveled, off, the, quickened, rate, of, escape, results, in, the, s, shape, of, the, learning, curve, the, learning, curve, also, suggested, that, different, species, learned, in, the, same, way, but, at, different, speeds, from, his, research, with, puzzle, boxes, thorndike, was, able, to, create, his, own, theory, of, learning, the, puzzle, box, experiments, were, motivated, in, part, by, thorndike, s, dislike, for, statements, that, animals, made, use, of, extraordinary, faculties, such, as, insight, in, their, problem, solving, in, the, first, place, most, of, the, books, do, not, give, us, a, psychology, but, rather, a, eulogy, of, animals, they, have, all, been, about, animal, intelligence, never, about, animal, stupidity, thorndike, meant, to, distinguish, clearly, whether, or, not, cats, escaping, from, puzzle, boxes, were, using, insight, thorndike, s, instruments, in, answering, this, question, were, learning, curves, revealed, by, plotting, the, time, it, took, for, an, animal, to, escape, the, box, each, time, it, was, in, the, box, he, reasoned, that, if, the, animals, were, showing, insight, then, their, time, to, escape, would, suddenly, drop, to, a, negligible, period, which, would, also, be, shown, in, the, learning, curve, as, an, abrupt, drop, while, animals, using, a, more, ordinary, method, of, trial, and, error, would, show, gradual, curves, his, finding, was, that, cats, consistently, showed, gradual, learning, thorndike, put, his, testing, expertise, to, work, for, the, united, states, army, during, world, war, i, participating, in, the, development, of, the, army, beta, test, used, to, evaluate, illiterate, unschooled, and, non, english, speaking, recruits, thorndike, believed, that, instruction, should, pursue, specified, socially, useful, goals, thorndike, believed, that, the, ability, to, learn, did, not, decline, until, age, 35, and, only, then, at, a, rate, of, 1, percent, per, year, thorndike, also, stated, the, law, of, effect, which, says, behaviors, that, are, followed, by, good, consequences, are, likely, to, be, repeated, in, the, future, thorndike, identified, the, three, main, areas, of, intellectual, development, the, first, being, abstract, intelligence, this, is, the, ability, to, process, and, understand, different, concepts, the, second, is, mechanical, intelligence, which, is, the, ability, to, handle, physical, objects, lastly, there, is, social, intelligence, this, is, the, ability, to, handle, human, interaction, thorndike, s, research, focused, on, instrumental, learning, which, means, that, learning, is, developed, from, the, organism, doing, something, for, example, he, placed, a, cat, inside, a, wooden, box, the, cat, would, use, various, methods, while, trying, to, get, out, but, nothing, would, work, until, it, hit, the, lever, afterwards, thorndike, tried, placing, the, cat, inside, the, wooden, box, again, this, time, the, cat, was, able, to, hit, the, lever, quickly, and, succeeded, in, getting, out, from, the, box, at, first, thorndike, emphasized, the, importance, of, dissatisfaction, stemming, from, failure, as, equal, to, the, reward, of, satisfaction, with, success, though, in, his, experiments, and, trials, on, humans, he, came, to, conclude, that, reward, is, a, much, more, effective, motivator, than, punishment, he, also, emphasized, that, the, satisfaction, must, come, immediately, after, the, success, or, the, lesson, would, not, sink, in, thorndike, was, a, proponent, of, eugenics, he, argued, that, selective, breeding, can, alter, man, s, capacity, to, learn, to, keep, sane, to, cherish, justice, or, to, be, happy, there, is, no, more, certain, and, economical, a, way, to, improve, man, s, environment, as, to, improve, his, nature, he, stated, i, hope, to, have, made, it, clear, that, we, have, much, to, learn, about, eugenics, and, also, that, we, already, know, enough, to, justify, us, in, providing, for, the, original, intellect, and, character, of, man, in, the, future, with, a, higher, purer, source, than, the, muddy, streams, of, the, past, if, it, is, our, duty, to, improve, the, face, of, the, world, and, human, customs, and, traditions, so, that, men, unborn, may, live, in, better, conditions, it, is, doubly, our, duty, to, improve, the, original, natures, of, these, men, themselves, for, there, is, no, surer, means, of, improving, the, conditions, of, life, and, furthermore, it, is, no, part, of, my, office, to, moralize, on, these, facts, but, surely, it, would, be, a, pitiable, thing, if, man, should, forever, make, inferior, men, as, a, by, product, of, passion, and, deny, good, men, life, in, mistaken, devotion, to, palliative, and, remedial, philanthropy, ethics, and, religion, must, teach, man, to, want, the, welfare, of, the, future, as, well, as, the, relief, of, the, cripple, before, his, eyes, and, science, must, teach, man, to, control, his, own, future, nature, as, well, as, the, animals, plants, and, physical, forces, amongst, which, he, will, have, to, live, it, is, a, noble, thing, that, human, reason, bred, of, a, myriad, unreasoned, happenings, and, driven, forth, into, life, by, whips, made, aeons, ago, with, no, thought, of, man, s, higher, wants, can, yet, turn, back, to, understand, man, s, birth, survey, his, journey, chart, and, steer, his, future, course, and, free, him, from, barriers, without, and, defects, within, until, the, last, removable, impediment, in, man, s, own, nature, dies, childless, human, reason, will, not, rest, thorndike, s, law, of, effect, and, puzzle, box, methodology, were, subjected, to, detailed, criticism, by, behaviorists, and, many, other, psychologists, the, criticisms, over, the, law, of, effect, mostly, cover, four, aspects, of, the, theory, the, implied, or, retroactive, working, of, the, effect, the, philosophical, implication, of, the, law, the, identification, of, the, effective, conditions, that, cause, learning, and, the, comprehensive, usefulness, of, the, law, thorndike, s, educational, psychology, began, a, trend, toward, behavioral, psychology, that, sought, to, use, empirical, evidence, and, a, scientific, approach, to, problem, solving, thorndike, was, among, some, of, the, first, psychologists, to, combine, learning, theory, psychometrics, and, applied, research, for, school, related, subjects, to, form, psychology, of, education, one, of, his, influences, on, education, is, seen, by, his, ideas, on, mass, marketing, of, tests, and, textbooks, at, that, time, thorndike, opposed, the, idea, that, learning, should, reflect, nature, which, was, the, main, thought, of, developmental, scientists, at, that, time, he, instead, thought, that, schooling, should, improve, upon, nature, unlike, many, other, psychologist, of, his, time, thorndike, took, a, statistical, approach, to, education, in, his, later, years, by, collecting, qualitative, information, intended, to, help, teachers, and, educators, deal, with, practical, educational, problems, thorndike, s, theory, was, an, association, theory, as, many, were, in, that, time, he, believed, that, the, association, between, stimulus, and, response, was, solidified, by, a, reward, or, confirmation, he, also, thought, that, motivation, was, an, important, factor, in, learning, the, law, of, effect, introduced, the, relation, between, reinforcers, and, punishers, although, thorndike, s, description, of, the, relation, between, reinforcers, and, punishers, was, incomplete, his, work, in, this, area, would, later, become, a, catalyst, in, further, research, such, as, that, of, b, f, skinner, thorndike, s, law, of, effect, states, that, responses, that, produce, a, desired, effect, are, more, likely, to, occur, again, whereas, responses, that, produce, an, unpleasant, effect, are, less, likely, to, occur, again, the, terms, desired, effect, and, unpleasant, effect, eventually, became, known, as, reinforcers, and, punishers, thorndike, s, contributions, to, the, behavioral, psychology, society, are, seen, through, his, influences, in, the, classroom, with, a, particular, focus, on, praising, and, ignoring, behaviors, praise, is, used, in, the, classroom, to, encourage, and, support, the, occurrence, of, a, desired, behavior, when, used, in, the, classroom, praise, has, been, shown, to, increase, correct, responses, and, appropriate, behavior, planned, ignoring, is, used, to, decrease, weaken, or, eliminate, the, occurrence, of, a, target, behavior, planned, ignoring, is, accomplished, by, removing, the, reinforcer, that, is, maintaining, the, behavior, for, example, when, the, teacher, does, not, pay, attention, to, a, whining, behavior, of, a, student, it, allows, the, student, to, realize, that, whining, will, not, succeed, in, gaining, the, attention, of, the, teacher, unlike, later, behaviorists, such, as, john, watson, who, placed, a, very, strong, emphasis, on, the, impact, of, environmental, influences, on, behavior, thorndike, believed, that, differences, in, the, parental, behavior, of, men, and, women, were, due, to, biological, rather, than, cultural, reasons, while, conceding, that, society, could, complicate, or, deform, what, he, believed, were, inborn, differences, he, believed, that, if, we, should, keep, the, environment, of, boys, and, girls, absolutely, similar, these, instincts, would, produce, sure, and, important, differences, between, the, mental, and, moral, activities, of, boys, and, girls, indeed, watson, himself, overtly, critiqued, the, idea, of, maternal, instincts, in, humans, in, a, report, of, his, observations, of, first, time, mothers, struggling, to, breastfeed, watson, argued, that, the, very, behaviors, thorndike, referred, to, as, resulting, from, a, nursing, instinct, stemming, from, unreasoning, tendencies, to, pet, coddle, and, do, for, others, were, performed, with, difficulty, by, new, mothers, and, thus, must, have, been, learned, while, instinctive, factors, are, practically, nil, thorndike, s, beliefs, about, inborn, differences, between, the, thoughts, and, behavior, of, men, and, women, included, outdated, arguments, about, the, role, of, women, in, society, for, example, along, with, the, nursing, instinct, thorndike, talked, about, the, instinct, of, submission, to, mastery, arguing, that, because, men, are, typically, physically, larger, than, women, women, in, general, are, thus, by, original, nature, submissive, to, men, in, general, although, these, opinions, lack, substantiating, evidence, such, beliefs, were, commonplace, during, this, era, and, in, many, cases, served, to, justify, prejudice, against, women, in, academia, including, entrance, into, doctoral, programs, psychological, laboratories, and, scientific, societies, thorndike, composed, three, different, word, books, to, assist, teachers, with, word, and, reading, instruction, after, publication, of, the, first, book, in, the, series, the, teacher, s, word, book, 1921, two, other, books, were, written, and, published, each, approximately, a, decade, apart, from, its, predecessor, the, second, book, in, the, series, its, full, title, being, a, teacher, s, word, book, of, the, twenty, thousand, words, found, most, frequently, and, widely, in, general, reading, for, children, and, young, people, was, published, in, 1932, and, the, third, and, final, book, the, teacher, s, word, book, of, 30, 000, words, was, published, in, 1944, in, the, preface, to, the, third, book, thorndike, writes, that, the, list, contained, therein, tells, anyone, who, wishes, to, know, whether, to, use, a, word, in, writing, speaking, or, teaching, how, common, the, word, is, in, standard, english, reading, matter, p, x, and, he, further, advises, that, the, list, can, best, be, employed, by, teachers, if, they, allow, it, to, guide, the, decisions, they, make, choosing, which, words, to, emphasize, during, reading, instruction, some, words, require, more, emphasis, than, others, and, according, to, thorndike, his, list, informs, teachers, of, the, most, frequently, occurring, words, that, should, be, reinforced, by, instruction, and, thus, become, a, permanent, part, of, stock, of, word, knowledge, p, xi, if, a, word, is, not, on, the, list, but, appears, in, an, educational, text, its, meaning, only, needs, to, be, understood, temporarily, in, the, context, in, which, it, was, found, and, then, summarily, discarded, from, memory, in, appendix, a, to, the, second, book, thorndike, gives, credit, to, his, word, counts, and, how, frequencies, were, assigned, to, particular, words, selected, sources, extrapolated, from, appendix, a, include, thorndike, contributed, a, great, deal, to, psychology, his, influence, on, animal, psychologists, especially, those, who, focused, on, behavior, plasticity, greatly, contributed, to, the, future, of, that, field, in, addition, to, helping, pave, the, way, towards, behaviorism, his, contribution, to, measurement, influenced, philosophy, the, administration, and, practice, of, education, military, administration, industrial, personnel, administration, civil, service, and, many, public, and, private, social, services, thorndike, influenced, many, schools, of, psychology, as, gestalt, psychologists, psychologists, studying, the, conditioned, reflex, and, behavioral, psychologists, all, studied, thorndike, s, research, as, a, starting, point, thorndike, was, a, contemporary, of, john, b, watson, and, ivan, pavlov, however, unlike, watson, thorndike, introduced, the, concept, of, reinforcement, thorndike, was, the, first, to, apply, psychological, principles, to, the, area, of, learning, his, research, led, to, many, theories, and, laws, of, learning, his, theory, of, learning, especially, the, law, of, effect, is, most, often, considered, to, be, his, greatest, achievement, in, 1929, thorndike, addressed, his, early, theory, of, learning, and, claimed, that, he, had, been, wrong, after, further, research, he, was, forced, to, denounce, his, law, of, exercise, completely, because, he, found, that, practice, alone, did, not, strengthen, an, association, and, that, time, alone, did, not, weaken, an, association, he, also, got, rid, of, half, of, the, law, of, effect, after, finding, that, a, satisfying, state, of, affairs, strengthens, an, association, but, punishment, is, not, effective, in, modifying, behavior, he, placed, a, great, emphasis, on, consequences, of, behavior, as, setting, the, foundation, for, what, is, and, is, not, learned, his, work, represents, the, transition, from, the, school, of, functionalism, to, behaviorism, and, enabled, psychology, to, focus, on, learning, theory, thorndike, s, work, would, eventually, be, a, major, influence, to, b, f, skinner, and, clark, hull, skinner, like, thorndike, put, animals, in, boxes, and, observed, them, to, see, what, they, were, able, to, learn, the, learning, theories, of, thorndike, and, pavlov, were, later, synthesized, by, clark, hull, his, work, on, motivation, and, attitude, formation, directly, affected, studies, on, human, nature, as, well, as, social, order, thorndike, s, research, drove, comparative, psychology, for, fifty, years, and, influenced, countless, psychologists, over, that, period, of, time, and, even, still, today, in, 1912, thorndike, was, elected, president, for, the, american, psychological, association, in, 1917, he, was, elected, as, a, fellow, of, the, american, statistical, association, he, was, admitted, to, the, national, academy, of, sciences, in, 1917, he, was, one, of, the, first, psychologists, to, be, admitted, to, the, association, thorndike, is, well, known, for, his, experiments, on, animals, supporting, the, law, of, effect, he, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1932, and, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1934, that, same, year, thorndike, was, elected, president, of, the, american, association, for, the, advancement, of, science, because, of, his, racist, sexist, and, antisemitic, ideals, amid, the, george, floyd, protests, of, 2020, the, board, of, trustees, of, teachers, college, in, new, york, voted, unanimously, to, remove, his, name, from, thorndike, hall
