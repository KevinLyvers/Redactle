seraphic, doctor, latin, doctor, seraphicus, his, feast, day, is, 15, july, many, writings, from, the, middle, ages, once, attributed, to, him, have, been, subsequently, re, classified, under, the, name, pseudo, bonaventure, he, was, born, at, civita, di, bagnoregio, not, far, from, viterbo, then, part, of, the, papal, states, almost, nothing, is, known, of, his, childhood, other, than, the, names, of, his, parents, giovanni, di, fidanza, and, maria, di, ritella, bonaventure, reports, that, in, his, youth, he, was, saved, from, an, untimely, death, by, the, prayers, of, francis, of, assisi, which, is, the, primary, motivation, for, bonaventure, s, writing, the, vita, he, entered, the, franciscan, order, in, 1243, and, studied, at, the, university, of, paris, possibly, under, alexander, of, hales, and, certainly, under, alexander, s, successor, john, of, rochelle, in, 1253, he, held, the, franciscan, chair, at, paris, a, dispute, between, seculars, and, mendicants, delayed, his, reception, as, master, until, 1257, where, his, degree, was, taken, in, company, with, thomas, aquinas, three, years, earlier, his, fame, had, earned, him, the, position, of, lecturer, on, the, four, books, of, sentences, a, book, of, theology, written, by, peter, lombard, in, the, twelfth, century, and, in, 1255, he, received, the, degree, of, master, the, medieval, equivalent, of, doctor, after, having, successfully, defended, his, order, against, the, reproaches, of, the, anti, mendicant, party, he, was, elected, minister, general, of, the, franciscan, order, on, 24, november, 1265, he, was, selected, for, the, post, of, archbishop, of, york, however, he, was, never, consecrated, and, resigned, the, appointment, in, october, 1266, during, his, tenure, the, general, chapter, of, narbonne, held, in, 1260, promulgated, a, decree, prohibiting, the, publication, of, any, work, out, of, the, order, without, permission, from, superiors, this, prohibition, has, induced, modern, writers, to, pass, severe, judgment, upon, roger, bacon, s, superiors, who, were, assumed, to, be, envious, of, bacon, s, abilities, however, the, prohibition, enjoined, on, bacon, was, a, general, one, which, extended, to, the, whole, order, its, promulgation, was, not, directed, against, him, but, rather, against, gerard, of, borgo, san, donnino, in, 1254, gerard, had, published, without, permission, a, work, introductorius, in, evangelium, ternum, an, introduction, to, the, eternal, gospel, that, was, judged, heretical, within, a, year, thereupon, the, general, chapter, of, narbonne, promulgated, their, decree, identical, with, the, constitutio, gravis, in, contrarium, bacon, speaks, of, the, prohibition, was, rescinded, in, roger, s, favor, unexpectedly, in, 1266, bonaventure, was, instrumental, in, procuring, the, election, of, pope, gregory, x, who, rewarded, him, with, the, title, of, cardinal, bishop, of, albano, and, insisted, on, his, presence, at, the, great, second, council, of, lyon, in, 1274, there, after, his, significant, contributions, led, to, a, union, of, the, greek, and, latin, churches, bonaventure, died, suddenly, and, under, suspicious, circumstances, the, 1913, edition, of, the, catholic, encyclopedia, has, citations, that, suggest, he, was, poisoned, but, no, mention, is, made, of, this, in, the, 2003, second, edition, of, the, new, catholic, encyclopedia, he, steered, the, franciscans, on, a, moderate, and, intellectual, course, that, made, them, the, most, prominent, order, in, the, catholic, church, until, the, coming, of, the, jesuits, his, theology, was, marked, by, an, attempt, completely, to, integrate, faith, and, reason, he, thought, of, christ, as, the, one, true, master, who, offers, humans, knowledge, that, begins, in, faith, is, developed, through, rational, understanding, and, is, perfected, by, mystical, union, with, god, in, the, year, 1434, 160, years, after, his, death, his, body, was, moved, to, a, new, church, that, was, considered, more, fitting, upon, doing, so, the, head, was, found, to, be, entirely, incorrupt, the, hair, lips, teeth, and, tongue, were, perfectly, preserved, and, retained, their, natural, colour, the, people, of, lyon, were, profoundly, affected, by, this, miracle, and, they, chose, bonaventure, for, the, patron, of, their, city, the, movement, already, on, foot, to, obtain, his, canonization, received, thereby, a, new, and, powerful, impetus, however, a, century, later, in, 1562, the, city, of, lyon, was, captured, by, huguenots, who, burned, bonaventure, s, body, in, the, public, square, in, the, 19th, century, during, the, dechristianization, of, france, during, the, french, revolution, the, urn, containing, the, incorrupt, head, was, hidden, after, which, the, church, was, razed, to, the, ground, the, urn, has, never, been, recovered, the, only, extant, relic, of, bonaventure, is, the, arm, and, hand, with, which, he, wrote, his, commentary, on, the, sentences, which, is, now, conserved, at, bagnoregio, in, the, parish, church, of, st, nicholas, bonaventure, was, formally, canonised, in, 1482, by, the, franciscan, pope, sixtus, iv, and, ranked, along, with, thomas, aquinas, as, the, greatest, of, the, doctors, of, the, church, by, another, franciscan, pope, sixtus, v, in, 1587, bonaventure, was, regarded, as, one, of, the, greatest, philosophers, of, the, middle, ages, his, works, as, arranged, in, the, most, recent, critical, edition, by, the, quaracchi, fathers, collegio, s, bonaventura, consist, of, a, commentary, on, the, sentences, of, lombard, in, four, volumes, and, eight, other, volumes, including, a, commentary, on, the, gospel, of, st, luke, and, a, number, of, smaller, works, the, most, famous, of, which, are, the, mind, s, road, to, god, itinerarium, mentis, in, deum, an, outline, of, his, theology, or, brief, reading, breviloquium, reduction, of, the, arts, to, theology, de, reductione, artium, ad, theologiam, and, soliloquy, on, the, four, spiritual, exercises, soliloquium, de, quatuor, mentalibus, exercitiis, the, tree, of, life, lignum, vitae, and, the, triple, way, de, triplici, via, the, latter, three, written, for, the, spiritual, direction, of, his, fellow, franciscans, the, german, philosopher, dieter, hattrup, denies, that, reduction, of, the, arts, to, theology, was, written, by, bonaventure, claiming, that, the, style, of, thinking, does, not, match, bonaventure, s, original, style, his, position, is, no, longer, tenable, given, recent, research, the, text, remains, indubitably, authentic, a, work, that, for, many, years, was, falsely, attributed, to, bonaventure, de, septem, itineribus, aeternitatis, was, actually, written, by, rudolf, von, biberach, c, 1270, 1329, for, isabelle, of, france, the, sister, of, king, louis, ix, of, france, and, her, monastery, of, poor, clares, at, longchamps, bonaventure, wrote, the, treatise, concerning, the, perfection, of, life, the, commentary, on, the, sentences, written, at, the, command, of, his, superiors, when, he, was, twenty, seven, is, bonaventure, s, major, work, and, most, of, his, other, theological, and, philosophical, writings, are, in, some, way, dependent, on, it, however, some, of, bonaventure, s, later, works, such, as, the, lectures, on, the, six, days, of, creation, show, substantial, developments, beyond, the, sentences, bonaventure, wrote, on, almost, every, subject, treated, by, the, scholastics, see, scholasticism, and, his, writings, are, substantial, a, great, number, of, them, deal, with, faith, in, christ, god, and, theology, no, work, of, bonaventure, s, is, exclusively, philosophical, a, striking, illustration, of, the, mutual, interpenetration, of, philosophy, and, theology, that, is, a, distinguishing, mark, of, the, scholastic, period, much, of, bonaventure, s, philosophical, thought, shows, a, considerable, influence, by, augustine, of, hippo, so, much, so, that, de, wulf, considers, him, the, best, medieval, representative, of, augustinianism, bonaventure, adds, aristotelian, principles, to, the, augustinian, doctrine, especially, in, connection, with, the, illumination, of, the, intellect, and, the, composition, of, human, beings, and, other, living, creatures, in, terms, of, matter, and, form, augustine, who, had, introduced, into, the, west, many, of, the, doctrines, that, would, define, scholastic, philosophy, was, a, critically, important, source, of, bonaventure, s, platonism, the, mystic, dionysius, the, areopagite, was, another, notable, influence, in, philosophy, bonaventure, presents, a, marked, contrast, to, his, contemporaries, roger, bacon, albert, the, great, and, thomas, aquinas, while, these, may, be, taken, as, representing, respectively, physical, science, yet, in, its, infancy, and, aristotelian, scholasticism, in, its, most, perfect, form, bonaventure, presents, the, mystical, and, platonizing, mode, of, speculation, that, had, already, to, some, extent, found, expression, in, hugo, and, richard, of, st, victor, alexander, of, hales, and, in, bernard, of, clairvaux, to, him, the, purely, intellectual, element, though, never, absent, is, of, inferior, interest, when, compared, with, the, living, power, of, the, affections, or, the, heart, like, thomas, aquinas, with, whom, he, shared, numerous, profound, agreements, in, matters, theological, and, philosophical, he, combated, the, aristotelian, notion, of, the, eternity, of, the, world, vigorously, though, he, disagreed, with, aquinas, about, the, abstract, possibility, of, an, eternal, universe, bonaventure, accepts, the, general, christian, neoplatonic, doctrine, found, in, augustine, and, pseudo, dionysius, that, forms, do, not, exist, as, subsistent, entities, but, as, ideals, predefinitions, archetypes, or, in, bonaventure, s, words, exemplars, in, the, mind, of, god, according, to, which, actual, things, were, formed, this, conception, has, no, slight, influence, upon, his, philosophy, physicist, and, philosopher, max, bernhard, weinstein, described, bonaventure, as, a, half, mystic, and, wrote, that, he, showed, strong, pandeistic, inclinations, emanationism, exemplarism, and, consummation, are, explicitly, listed, by, bonaventure, as, the, core, principles, of, theology, all, of, which, are, heavily, platonic, themes, and, carry, equally, platonic, subtopics, and, discussions, but, yet, are, all, rooted, in, the, second, person, of, the, trinity, the, son, incarnate, as, jesus, christ, who, is, the, principio, of, divine, exemplars, from, which, creation, emanates, from, and, by, which, creation, is, made, intelligible, and, which, creation, finds, as, its, goal, creation, is, two, fold, expressing, the, divine, truth, the, divine, exemplar, in, the, word, of, god, it, speaks, of, that, which, it, is, the, likeness, and, subsists, in, itself, and, in, the, son, bonaventure, s, mature, work, the, collationes, in, hexaemeron, takes, exemplarism, drawn, out, from, his, transformation, of, platonic, realism, as, the, basis, for, vital, points, of, christian, theological, dogma, god, s, love, of, creation, god, s, foreknowledge, providence, and, divine, governance, the, unconstrained, but, perfect, will, of, god, divine, justice, and, the, devil, the, immortality, of, and, uniqueness, of, human, soul, and, the, goodness, and, beauty, of, creation, this, also, serves, as, his, repudiation, of, arab, peripatetic, necessitarianism, and, pure, aristotelian, identified, by, the, greek, fathers, if, left, uncorrected, by, plato, and, revelation, which, teach, the, same, thing, under, different, modes, upon, there, follows, another, that, is, that, god, has, neither, foreknowledge, nor, providence, since, he, does, not, have, within, himself, a, rational, justification, of, things, by, which, he, could, know, them, they, also, say, that, there, are, no, truths, concerning, the, future, except, that, of, necessary, things, and, from, this, it, follows, that, all, things, come, about, either, by, chance, or, by, necessity, and, since, it, is, impossible, that, things, come, about, by, chance, the, arabs, conclude, to, absolute, necessity, that, is, that, these, substances, that, move, the, globe, are, the, necessary, causes, of, all, things, from, this, it, follows, that, truth, is, hidden, that, is, the, truth, of, government, of, worldly, things, in, terms, of, pain, and, glory, if, indeed, these, substances, are, inerrant, movers, nothing, is, supposed, concerning, hell, or, the, existence, of, the, devil, neither, did, aristotle, ever, suppose, the, existence, of, the, devil, nor, happiness, after, this, life, as, it, appears, here, then, there, is, a, threefold, error, a, concealment, of, exemplarity, of, divine, providence, and, of, world, government, like, all, the, great, scholastic, doctors, bonaventure, starts, with, the, discussion, of, the, relations, between, reason, and, faith, all, the, sciences, are, but, the, handmaids, of, theology, reason, can, discover, some, of, the, moral, truths, that, form, the, groundwork, of, the, christian, system, but, other, truths, can, only, be, received, and, apprehended, through, divine, illumination, to, obtain, this, illumination, the, soul, must, employ, the, proper, means, which, are, prayer, the, exercise, of, the, virtues, whereby, it, is, rendered, fit, to, accept, the, divine, light, and, meditation, that, may, rise, even, to, ecstatic, union, with, god, the, supreme, end, of, life, is, a, union, in, contemplation, or, intellect, or, intense, absorbing, love, but, it, cannot, be, entirely, reached, in, this, life, and, remains, as, a, hope, for, the, future, like, aquinas, and, other, notable, thirteenth, century, philosophers, and, theologians, bonaventure, believed, that, it, is, possible, to, logically, prove, the, existence, of, god, and, the, immortality, of, the, soul, in, fact, unlike, aquinas, bonaventure, holds, that, reason, can, demonstrate, the, beginning, of, the, world, he, offers, several, arguments, for, the, existence, of, god, including, versions, of, anselm, of, canterbury, s, ontological, argument, and, augustine, s, argument, from, eternal, truths, his, main, argument, for, the, immortality, of, the, soul, appeals, to, humans, natural, desire, for, perfect, happiness, and, is, reflected, in, c, s, lewis, s, argument, from, desire, contrary, to, aquinas, bonaventure, did, not, believe, that, philosophy, was, an, autonomous, discipline, that, could, be, pursued, successfully, independently, of, theology, any, philosopher, is, bound, to, fall, into, serious, error, he, believed, who, lacks, the, light, of, faith, a, master, of, the, memorable, phrase, bonaventure, held, that, philosophy, opens, the, mind, to, at, least, three, different, routes, humans, can, take, on, their, journey, to, god, non, intellectual, material, creatures, he, conceived, as, shadows, and, vestiges, literally, footprints, of, god, understood, as, the, ultimate, cause, of, a, world, that, philosophical, reason, can, prove, was, created, at, a, first, moment, in, time, intellectual, creatures, he, conceived, of, as, images, and, likenesses, of, god, the, workings, of, the, human, mind, and, will, leading, us, to, god, understood, as, illuminator, of, knowledge, and, donor, of, grace, and, virtue, the, final, route, to, god, is, the, route, of, being, in, which, bonaventure, brought, anselm, s, argument, together, with, aristotelian, and, neoplatonic, metaphysics, to, view, god, as, the, absolutely, perfect, being, whose, essence, entails, its, existence, an, absolutely, simple, being, that, causes, all, other, composite, beings, to, exist, bonaventure, s, thoughts, on, our, ability, to, see, the, trinity, in, creation, lost, or, hampered, in, the, fall, are, recorded, and, praised, by, pope, francis, in, his, encyclical, letter, laudato, si, saint, bonaventure, went, so, far, as, to, say, that, human, beings, before, sin, were, able, to, see, how, each, creature, testifies, that, god, is, three, the, reflection, of, the, trinity, was, there, to, be, recognized, in, nature, when, that, book, was, open, to, man, and, our, eyes, had, not, yet, become, darkened, teaches, us, that, each, creature, bears, in, itself, a, specifically, trinitarian, structure, so, real, that, it, could, be, readily, contemplated, if, only, the, human, gaze, were, not, so, partial, dark, and, fragile, in, this, way, he, points, out, to, us, the, challenge, of, trying, to, read, reality, in, a, trinitarian, key, bonaventure, however, is, not, only, a, meditative, thinker, whose, works, may, form, good, manuals, of, devotion, he, is, a, dogmatic, theologian, of, high, rank, and, on, all, the, disputed, questions, of, scholastic, thought, such, as, universals, matter, seminal, reasons, the, principle, of, individuation, or, the, intellectus, agens, he, gives, weighty, and, well, reasoned, decisions, he, agrees, with, albert, the, great, in, regarding, theology, as, a, practical, science, its, truths, according, to, his, view, are, peculiarly, adapted, to, influence, the, affections, he, discusses, very, carefully, the, nature, and, meaning, of, the, divine, attributes, considers, universals, to, be, the, ideal, forms, pre, existing, in, the, divine, mind, according, to, which, things, were, shaped, holds, matter, to, be, pure, potentiality, that, receives, individual, being, and, determinateness, from, the, formative, power, of, god, acting, according, to, the, ideas, and, finally, maintains, that, the, agent, intellect, has, no, separate, existence, on, these, and, on, many, other, points, of, scholastic, philosophy, the, seraphic, doctor, exhibits, a, combination, of, subtlety, and, moderation, which, makes, his, works, particularly, valuable, in, form, and, intent, the, work, of, bonaventure, is, always, the, work, of, a, theologian, he, writes, as, one, for, whom, the, only, angle, of, vision, and, the, proximate, criterion, of, truth, is, the, christian, faith, this, fact, affects, his, importance, as, a, philosopher, when, coupled, with, his, style, it, makes, bonaventure, perhaps, the, least, accessible, of, the, major, figures, of, the, thirteenth, century, this, is, true, because, philosophy, interests, him, largely, as, a, praeparatio, evangelica, as, something, to, be, interpreted, as, a, foreshadow, of, or, deviation, from, what, god, has, revealed, bonaventure, s, feast, day, was, included, in, the, general, roman, calendar, immediately, upon, his, canonisation, in, 1482, it, was, at, first, celebrated, on, the, second, sunday, in, july, but, was, moved, in, 1568, to, 14, july, since, 15, july, the, anniversary, of, his, death, was, at, that, time, taken, up, with, the, feast, of, saint, henry, it, remained, on, that, date, with, the, rank, of, double, until, 1960, when, it, was, reclassified, as, a, feast, of, the, third, class, in, 1969, it, was, classified, as, an, obligatory, memorial, and, assigned, to, the, date, of, his, death, 15, july, he, is, the, patron, saint, of, bowel, disorders, bonaventure, is, remembered, in, the, church, of, england, with, a, commemoration, on, 15, july, bonaventure, drive, bonaventure, public, school, in, london, ontario, canada, bonaventura, college, is, a, catholic, high, school, in, leiden, in, the, netherlands
