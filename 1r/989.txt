europe, by, the, latinized, algazelus, or, algazel, was, a, persian, sunni, muslim, polymath, he, is, known, as, one, of, the, most, prominent, and, influential, jurisconsults, legal, theoreticians, muftis, philosophers, theologians, logicians, and, mystics, in, islamic, history, he, is, considered, to, be, the, 11th, century, s, mujaddid, a, renewer, of, the, faith, who, according, to, the, prophetic, hadith, appears, once, every, 100, years, to, restore, the, faith, of, the, islamic, community, al, ghazali, s, works, were, so, highly, acclaimed, by, his, contemporaries, that, he, was, awarded, the, honorific, title, proof, of, islam, ujjat, al, isl, m, al, ghazali, was, a, prominent, mujtahid, in, the, shafi, i, school, of, law, much, of, al, ghazali, s, work, stemmed, around, his, spiritual, crises, following, his, appointment, as, the, head, of, the, nizzamiyya, university, in, baghdad, which, was, the, most, prestigious, academic, position, in, the, muslim, world, at, the, time, this, led, to, his, eventual, disappearance, from, the, muslim, world, for, over, 10, years, realising, he, chose, the, path, of, status, and, ego, over, god, it, was, during, this, period, where, many, of, his, great, works, were, written, he, believed, that, the, islamic, spiritual, tradition, had, become, moribund, and, that, the, spiritual, sciences, taught, by, the, first, generation, of, muslims, had, been, forgotten, this, belief, led, him, to, write, his, magnum, opus, entitled, i, y, ul, m, ad, d, n, the, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, among, his, other, works, the, tah, fut, al, fal, sifa, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, is, a, landmark, in, the, history, of, philosophy, as, it, advances, the, critique, of, aristotelian, science, developed, later, in, 14th, century, europe, al, ghazali, was, born, in, c, 1058, in, tus, then, part, of, the, seljuk, empire, he, was, a, muslim, scholar, law, specialist, rationalist, and, spiritualist, of, persian, descent, he, was, born, in, tabaran, a, town, in, the, district, of, tus, khorasan, now, part, of, iran, not, long, after, seljuks, entered, baghdad, and, ended, shia, buyid, amir, al, umaras, this, marked, the, start, of, seljuk, influence, over, caliphate, while, the, seljuk, dynasty, s, influence, grew, abu, suleiman, dawud, chaghri, beg, married, his, daughter, arslan, khatun, khadija, to, caliph, al, qa, im, in, 1056, a, posthumous, tradition, the, authenticity, of, which, has, been, questioned, in, recent, scholarship, is, that, his, father, died, in, poverty, and, left, the, young, al, ghazali, and, his, brother, ahmad, to, the, care, of, a, sufi, al, ghazali, s, contemporary, and, first, biographer, abd, al, ghafir, al, farisi, records, merely, that, al, ghazali, began, to, receive, instruction, in, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, from, ahmad, al, radhakani, a, local, teacher, and, abu, ali, farmadi, a, naqshbandi, sufi, from, tus, 26, 27, he, later, studied, under, al, juwayni, the, distinguished, jurist, and, theologian, and, the, most, outstanding, muslim, scholar, of, his, time, in, nishapur, 292, perhaps, after, a, period, of, study, in, gurgan, after, al, juwayni, s, death, in, 1085, al, ghazali, departed, from, nishapur, and, joined, the, court, of, nizam, al, mulk, the, powerful, vizier, of, the, seljuk, empire, which, was, likely, centered, in, isfahan, after, bestowing, upon, him, the, titles, of, brilliance, of, the, religion, and, eminence, among, the, religious, leaders, nizam, al, mulk, advanced, al, ghazali, in, july, 1091, to, the, most, prestigious, and, most, challenging, professorial, position, at, the, time, the, nizamiyya, madrasa, in, baghdad, he, underwent, a, spiritual, crisis, in, 1095, which, some, speculate, was, brought, on, by, clinical, hysteria, abandoned, his, career, and, left, baghdad, on, the, pretext, of, going, on, pilgrimage, to, mecca, making, arrangements, for, his, family, he, disposed, of, his, wealth, and, adopted, an, ascetic, lifestyle, according, to, biographer, duncan, b, macdonald, the, purpose, of, abstaining, from, scholastic, work, was, to, confront, the, spiritual, experience, and, more, ordinary, understanding, of, the, word, and, the, traditions, after, some, time, in, damascus, and, jerusalem, with, a, visit, to, medina, and, mecca, in, 1096, he, returned, to, tus, to, spend, the, next, several, years, in, uzla, seclusion, the, seclusion, consisted, in, abstaining, from, teaching, at, state, sponsored, institutions, but, he, continued, to, publish, receive, visitors, and, teach, in, the, zawiya, private, madrasa, and, khanqah, sufi, lodge, that, he, had, built, fakhr, al, mulk, grand, vizier, to, ahmad, sanjar, pressed, al, ghazali, to, return, to, the, nizamiyya, in, nishapur, al, ghazali, reluctantly, capitulated, in, 1106, fearing, rightly, that, he, and, his, teachings, would, meet, with, resistance, and, controversy, he, later, returned, to, tus, and, declined, an, invitation, in, 1110, from, the, grand, vizier, of, the, seljuq, sultan, muhammad, i, to, return, to, baghdad, he, died, on, 19, december, 1111, according, to, abd, al, ghafir, al, farisi, he, had, several, daughters, but, no, sons, al, ghazali, contributed, significantly, to, the, development, of, a, systematic, view, of, sufism, and, its, integration, and, acceptance, in, mainstream, islam, as, a, scholar, of, islam, he, belonged, to, the, shafi, i, school, of, islamic, jurisprudence, and, to, the, asharite, school, of, theology, al, ghazali, received, many, titles, such, as, zayn, al, d, n, and, ujjat, al, isl, m, he, is, viewed, as, the, key, member, of, the, influential, asharite, school, of, early, muslim, philosophy, and, the, most, important, refuter, of, the, mutazilites, however, he, chose, a, slightly, different, position, in, comparison, with, the, asharites, his, beliefs, and, thoughts, differ, in, some, aspects, from, the, orthodox, asharite, school, a, total, of, about, 70, works, can, be, attributed, to, al, ghazali, he, is, also, known, to, have, written, a, fatwa, against, the, taifa, kings, of, al, andalus, declaring, them, to, be, unprincipled, not, fit, to, rule, and, that, they, should, be, removed, from, power, this, fatwa, was, used, by, yusuf, ibn, tashfin, to, justify, his, conquest, of, al, andalus, al, ghazali, s, 11th, century, book, titled, tah, fut, al, fal, sifa, incoherence, of, the, philosophers, marked, a, major, turn, in, islamic, epistemology, the, encounter, with, skepticism, led, al, ghazali, to, investigate, a, form, of, theological, occasionalism, or, the, belief, that, all, causal, events, and, interactions, are, not, the, product, of, material, conjunctions, but, rather, the, immediate, and, present, will, of, god, in, the, next, century, ibn, rushd, or, averroes, drafted, a, lengthy, rebuttal, of, al, ghazali, s, incoherence, entitled, the, incoherence, of, the, incoherence, however, the, epistemological, course, of, islamic, thought, had, already, been, set, al, ghazali, gave, as, an, example, of, the, illusion, of, independent, laws, of, cause, the, fact, that, cotton, burns, when, coming, into, contact, with, fire, while, it, might, seem, as, though, a, natural, law, was, at, work, it, happened, each, and, every, time, only, because, god, willed, it, to, happen, the, event, was, a, direct, product, of, divine, intervention, as, any, more, attention, grabbing, miracle, averroes, by, contrast, insisted, while, god, created, the, natural, law, humans, could, more, usefully, say, that, fire, caused, cotton, to, burn, because, creation, had, a, pattern, that, they, could, discern, the, incoherence, also, marked, a, turning, point, in, islamic, philosophy, in, its, vehement, rejections, of, aristotle, and, plato, the, book, took, aim, at, the, fal, sifa, a, loosely, defined, group, of, islamic, philosophers, from, the, 8th, through, the, 11th, centuries, most, notable, among, them, avicenna, and, al, farabi, who, drew, intellectually, upon, the, ancient, greeks, the, influence, of, al, ghazali, s, book, is, still, debated, professor, of, arabic, and, islamic, science, george, saliba, in, 2007, argued, that, the, decline, of, science, in, the, 11th, century, has, been, overstated, pointing, to, continuing, advances, particularly, in, astronomy, as, late, as, the, 14th, century, professor, of, mathematics, nuh, aydin, wrote, in, 2012, that, one, the, most, important, reasons, of, the, decline, of, science, in, the, islamic, world, has, been, al, ghazali, s, attack, of, philosophers, scientists, physicists, mathematicians, logicians, the, attack, peaked, in, his, book, incoherence, whose, central, idea, of, theological, occasionalism, implies, that, philosophers, cannot, give, rational, explanations, to, either, metaphysical, or, physical, questions, the, idea, caught, on, and, nullified, the, critical, thinking, in, the, islamic, world, on, the, other, hand, author, and, journalist, hassan, hassan, in, 2012, argued, that, while, indeed, scientific, thought, in, islam, was, stifled, in, the, 11th, century, the, person, mostly, to, blame, is, not, al, ghazali, but, nizam, al, mulk, another, of, al, ghazali, s, major, works, is, ihya, ulum, al, din, or, ihya, u, ulumiddin, the, revival, of, religious, sciences, it, covers, almost, all, fields, of, islamic, sciences, fiqh, islamic, jurisprudence, kalam, theology, and, sufism, it, contains, four, major, sections, acts, of, worship, rub, al, ibadat, norms, of, daily, life, rub, al, adatat, the, ways, to, perdition, rub, al, muhlikat, and, the, ways, to, salvation, rub, al, munjiyat, the, ihya, became, the, most, frequently, recited, islamic, text, after, the, qur, an, and, the, hadith, its, great, achievement, was, to, bring, orthodox, sunni, theology, and, sufi, mysticism, together, in, a, useful, comprehensive, guide, to, every, aspect, of, muslim, life, and, death, the, book, was, well, received, by, islamic, scholars, such, as, nawawi, who, stated, that, were, the, books, of, islam, all, to, be, lost, excepting, only, the, ihya, it, would, suffice, to, replace, them, all, the, alchemy, of, happiness, is, a, rewritten, version, of, the, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, after, the, existential, crisis, that, caused, him, to, completely, re, examine, his, way, of, living, and, his, approach, to, religion, al, ghazali, put, together, the, alchemy, of, happiness, one, of, the, key, sections, of, ghazali, s, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, is, disciplining, the, soul, which, focuses, on, the, internal, struggles, that, every, muslim, will, face, over, the, course, of, his, lifetime, the, first, chapter, primarily, focuses, on, how, one, can, develop, himself, into, a, person, with, positive, attributes, and, good, personal, characteristics, the, second, chapter, has, a, more, specific, focus, sexual, satisfaction, and, gluttony, here, ghazali, states, that, indeed, every, man, has, these, desires, and, needs, and, that, it, is, natural, to, want, these, things, however, the, prophet, explicitly, states, that, there, must, be, a, middle, ground, for, man, in, order, to, practice, the, tenets, of, islam, faithfully, the, ultimate, goal, that, ghazali, is, presenting, not, only, in, these, two, chapters, but, in, the, entirety, of, the, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, is, that, there, must, be, moderation, in, every, aspect, of, the, soul, of, a, man, an, equilibrium, these, two, chapters, were, the, 22nd, and, 23rd, chapters, respectively, in, ghazali, s, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, al, ghazali, crafted, his, rebuttal, of, the, aristotelian, viewpoint, on, the, creation, of, the, world, in, the, eternity, of, the, world, al, ghazali, essentially, formulates, two, main, arguments, for, what, he, views, as, a, sacrilegious, thought, process, central, to, the, aristotelian, approach, is, the, concept, that, motion, will, always, precede, motion, or, in, other, words, a, force, will, always, create, another, force, and, therefore, for, a, force, to, be, created, another, force, must, act, upon, that, force, this, means, that, in, essence, time, stretches, infinitely, both, into, the, future, and, into, the, past, which, therefore, proves, that, god, did, not, create, the, universe, at, one, specific, point, in, time, al, ghazali, counters, this, by, first, stating, that, if, the, world, was, created, with, exact, boundaries, then, in, its, current, form, there, would, be, no, need, for, a, time, before, the, creation, of, the, world, by, god, al, ghazali, lays, out, in, the, decisive, criterion, for, distinguishing, islam, from, clandestine, unbelief, his, approach, to, muslim, orthodoxy, ghazali, veers, from, the, often, hardline, stance, of, many, of, his, contemporaries, during, this, time, period, and, states, that, as, long, as, one, believes, in, the, prophet, muhammad, and, god, himself, there, are, many, different, ways, to, practice, islam, and, that, any, of, the, many, traditions, practiced, in, good, faith, by, believers, should, not, be, viewed, as, heretical, by, other, muslims, while, ghazali, does, state, that, any, muslim, practicing, islam, in, good, faith, is, not, guilty, of, apostasy, he, does, outline, in, the, criterion, that, there, is, one, standard, of, islam, that, is, more, correct, than, the, others, and, that, those, practicing, the, faith, incorrectly, should, be, moved, to, change, in, ghazali, s, view, only, the, prophet, himself, could, deem, a, faithfully, practicing, muslim, an, infidel, and, his, work, was, a, reaction, to, the, religious, persecution, and, strife, that, occurred, often, during, this, time, period, between, various, islamic, sects, the, autobiography, al, ghazali, wrote, towards, the, end, of, his, life, deliverance, from, error, al, munqidh, min, al, dalal, is, considered, a, work, of, major, importance, in, it, al, ghazali, recounts, how, once, a, crisis, of, epistemological, skepticism, had, been, resolved, by, a, light, which, god, most, high, cast, into, my, breast, the, key, to, most, knowledge, 66, he, studied, and, mastered, the, arguments, of, kalam, islamic, philosophy, and, ismailism, though, appreciating, what, was, valid, in, the, first, two, of, these, at, least, he, determined, that, all, three, approaches, were, inadequate, and, found, ultimate, value, only, in, the, mystical, experience, and, insight, he, attained, as, a, result, of, following, sufi, practices, william, james, in, varieties, of, religious, experience, considered, the, autobiography, an, important, document, for, the, purely, literary, student, who, would, like, to, become, acquainted, with, the, inwardness, of, religions, other, than, the, christian, because, of, the, scarcity, of, recorded, personal, religious, confessions, and, autobiographical, literature, from, this, period, outside, the, christian, tradition, 307, al, ghazali, wrote, most, of, his, works, in, persian, and, in, arabic, his, most, important, persian, work, is, kimiya, yi, sa, adat, the, alchemy, of, happiness, it, is, al, ghazali, s, own, persian, version, of, ihya, ulum, al, din, the, revival, of, religious, sciences, in, arabic, but, a, shorter, work, it, is, one, of, the, outstanding, works, of, 11th, century, persian, literature, the, book, was, published, several, times, in, tehran, by, the, edition, of, hussain, khadev, jam, a, renowned, iranian, scholar, it, is, translated, to, english, arabic, turkish, urdu, azerbaijani, and, other, languages, another, authentic, work, of, al, ghazali, is, the, so, called, first, part, of, the, nasihat, al, muluk, counsel, for, kings, addressed, to, the, saljuqid, ruler, of, khurasan, ahmad, b, malik, shah, sanjar, r, 490, 552, 1097, 1157, the, text, was, written, after, an, official, reception, at, his, court, in, 503, 1109, and, upon, his, request, al, ghazali, was, summoned, to, sanjar, because, of, the, intrigues, of, his, opponents, and, their, criticism, of, his, student, s, compilation, in, arabic, al, mankhul, min, ta, liqat, al, usul, the, sifted, notes, on, the, fundamentals, in, addition, to, his, refusal, to, continue, teaching, at, the, nizamiya, of, nishapur, after, the, reception, al, ghazali, had, apparently, a, private, audience, with, sanjar, during, which, he, quoted, a, verse, from, the, quran, 14, 24, have, you, not, seen, how, allah, sets, forth, a, parable, of, a, beautiful, phrase, being, like, a, beautiful, tree, whose, roots, are, firm, and, whose, branches, are, in, heaven, the, genuine, text, of, the, nasihat, al, muluk, which, is, actually, an, official, epistle, with, a, short, explanatory, note, on, al, man, ul, added, on, its, frontispiece, the, majority, of, other, persian, texts, ascribed, to, him, with, the, use, of, his, fame, and, authority, especially, in, the, genre, of, mirrors, for, princes, are, either, deliberate, forgeries, fabricated, with, different, purposes, or, compilations, falsely, attributed, to, him, the, most, famous, among, them, is, ay, farzand, o, child, this, is, undoubtedly, a, literary, forgery, fabricated, in, persian, one, or, two, generations, after, al, ghazali, s, death, the, sources, used, for, the, forgery, consist, of, two, genuine, letters, by, al, ghazali, s, number, 4, in, part, and, number, 33, totally, both, appear, in, the, faza, il, al, anam, another, source, is, a, letter, known, as, ayniya, and, written, by, muhammad, s, younger, brother, majd, al, din, ahmad, al, ghazali, d, 520, 1126, to, his, famous, disciple, ayn, al, quzat, hamadani, 492, 526, 1098, 1131, the, letter, was, published, in, the, majmu, a, yi, athar, i, farsi, yi, ahmad, i, ghazali, collection, of, the, persian, writings, of, ahmad, ghazali, the, other, is, ayn, al, quzat, s, own, letter, published, in, the, namaha, yi, ayn, al, quzat, hamadani, letters, by, ayn, al, quzat, hamadani, later, ay, farzand, was, translated, into, arabic, and, became, famous, as, ayyuha, al, walad, the, arabic, equivalent, of, the, persian, title, the, earliest, manuscripts, with, the, arabic, translation, date, from, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, and, most, of, the, others, from, the, 17th, century, the, earliest, known, secondary, translation, from, arabic, into, ottoman, turkish, was, done, in, 983, 1575, in, modern, times, the, text, was, translated, from, arabic, into, many, european, languages, and, published, innumerable, times, in, turkey, as, eyy, he, l, veled, or, ey, o, ul, a, less, famous, pand, nama, book, of, counsel, also, written, in, the, genre, of, advice, literature, is, a, very, late, compilatory, letter, of, an, unknown, author, formally, addressed, to, some, ruler, and, falsely, attributed, to, al, ghazali, obviously, because, it, consists, of, many, fragments, borrowed, mostly, from, various, parts, of, the, kimiya, yi, sa, adat, during, his, life, al, ghazali, wrote, over, 70, books, on, science, islamic, reasoning, and, sufism, al, ghazali, played, a, major, role, in, integrating, sufism, with, shariah, he, was, also, the, first, to, present, a, formal, description, of, sufism, in, his, works, his, works, also, strengthened, the, status, of, sunni, islam, against, other, schools, the, batinite, ismailism, had, emerged, in, persian, territories, and, were, gaining, more, and, more, power, during, al, ghazali, s, period, as, nizam, al, mulk, was, assassinated, by, the, members, of, ismailis, in, his, fada, ih, al, batiniyya, the, infamies, of, the, esotericists, al, ghazali, declared, them, unbelievers, whose, blood, may, be, spilled, al, ghazali, succeeded, in, gaining, widespread, acceptance, for, sufism, at, the, expense, of, philosophy, at, the, same, time, in, his, refutation, of, philosophers, he, made, use, of, their, philosophical, categories, and, thus, helped, to, give, them, wider, circulation, the, staple, of, his, religious, philosophy, was, arguing, that, the, creator, was, the, center, point, of, all, human, life, that, played, a, direct, role, in, all, world, affairs, al, ghazali, s, influence, was, not, limited, to, islam, but, in, fact, his, works, were, widely, circulated, among, christian, and, hebrew, scholars, and, philosophers, some, of, the, more, notable, philosophers, and, scholars, in, the, west, include, david, hume, dante, and, st, thomas, aquinas, moses, ben, maimon, a, jewish, theologian, was, deeply, interested, and, vested, in, the, works, of, al, ghazali, one, of, the, more, notable, achievements, of, ghazali, were, his, writing, and, reform, of, education, that, laid, the, path, of, islamic, education, from, the, 12th, to, the, 19th, centuries, al, ghazali, s, works, were, heavily, relied, upon, by, islamic, mathematicians, and, astronomers, such, as, at, tusi, al, ghazali, was, by, every, indication, of, his, writings, a, true, mystic, in, the, persian, sense, he, believed, himself, to, be, more, mystical, or, religious, than, he, was, philosophical, however, he, is, more, widely, regarded, by, some, scholars, as, a, leading, figure, of, islamic, philosophy, and, thought, he, describes, his, philosophical, approach, as, a, seeker, of, true, knowledge, a, deeper, understanding, of, the, philosophical, and, scientific, and, a, better, understanding, of, mysticism, and, cognition, the, period, following, ghazali, has, tentatively, been, called, the, golden, age, of, arabic, philosophy, initiated, by, ghazali, s, successful, integration, of, logic, into, the, islamic, seminary, madrasah, curriculum, imam, al, ghazali, mainly, chose, to, keep, his, legacy, in, his, books, so, he, wrote, more, than, 70, books, in, his, career, it, is, said, about, his, book, ihya, ulum, uddin, the, revival, of, the, religious, sciences, that, if, one, has, no, shaykh, then, he, has, ihya, through, his, writing, he, still, influences, islamic, scholars, and, community, prominent, scholars, like, shaykh, hamza, yusuf, shaykh, ibrahim, osi, efa, dr, abdul, hakim, murad, timothy, winter, is, greatly, influenced, by, his, teaching, people, refer, to, him, as, the, proof, of, islam, al, ghazali, mentioned, the, number, of, his, works, more, than, 70, in, one, of, his, letters, to, sultan, sanjar, in, the, late, years, of, his, life, some, five, dozen, are, plausibly, identifiable, and, several, hundred, attributed, works, many, of, them, duplicates, because, of, varying, titles, are, doubtful, or, spurious, the, tradition, of, falsely, attributing, works, to, al, ghazali, increased, in, the, 13th, century, after, the, dissemination, of, the, large, corpus, of, works, by, ibn, arabi, bibliographies, have, been, published, by, william, montgomery, watt, the, works, attributed, to, al, ghazali, maurice, bouyges, essai, de, chronologie, des, oeuvres, d, al, ghazali, and, others, al, ghazali, s, economic, philosophy, was, primarily, influenced, by, his, islamic, beliefs, he, argued, that, the, importance, of, economic, activity, lay, both, in, its, benefit, to, society, as, well, being, necessary, for, salvation, he, established, three, goals, of, economic, activity, that, he, believed, were, part, of, one, s, religious, obligation, achievement, of, self, sufficiency, for, one, s, survival, provision, for, the, well, being, of, one, s, progeny, and, provision, for, assisting, those, in, economic, need, he, argued, that, subsistence, living, or, living, in, a, way, that, provides, the, basic, necessities, for, only, one, s, family, would, not, be, an, acceptable, practice, to, be, held, by, the, general, population, because, of, the, detrimental, results, that, he, believed, that, would, bring, upon, the, economy, but, he, acknowledged, that, some, people, may, choose, to, live, the, subsistence, lifestyle, at, their, own, will, for, the, sake, of, their, personal, religious, journey, conversely, he, discouraged, people, from, purchasing, or, possessing, excessive, material, items, suggesting, that, any, additional, money, earned, could, be, given, to, provide, for, the, poor, al, ghazali, believed, that, the, imposition, of, income, equality, in, society, should, not, be, a, necessity, instead, he, advocated, for, individuals, to, be, guided, by, the, spirit, of, islamic, brotherhood, encouraging, them, to, willingly, share, their, wealth, however, he, acknowledged, that, this, ideal, isn, t, universally, practiced, according, to, him, earned, wealth, can, serve, two, potential, purposes, the, first, is, for, the, good, of, oneself, which, includes, maintaining, one, s, own, health, and, that, of, their, family, as, well, as, extending, care, to, others, and, engaging, in, actions, beneficial, to, the, islamic, community, the, other, is, what, al, ghazali, would, consider, misuse, spending, it, selfishly, on, extravagant, or, unnecessary, material, items, in, terms, of, trade, al, ghazali, discussed, the, necessity, of, exchanging, goods, across, close, cities, as, well, as, larger, borders, because, it, allows, more, goods, which, may, be, necessary, and, not, yet, available, to, be, accessible, to, more, people, in, various, locations, he, recognized, the, necessity, of, trade, and, its, overall, beneficial, effect, on, the, economy, but, making, money, in, that, way, might, not, be, considered, the, most, virtuous, in, his, beliefs, he, did, not, support, people, taking, excessive, profits, from, their, trade, sales, according, to, william, montgomery, watt, al, ghazali, was, considered, to, be, the, mujaddid, reviver, of, his, age, many, perhaps, most, later, muslims, concurred, and, according, to, watt, some, have, even, considered, him, to, be, the, greatest, muslim, after, muhammad, as, an, example, the, islamic, scholar, al, safadi, stated, muhammad, ibn, muhammad, ibn, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, the, proof, of, islam, ornament, of, the, faith, abu, hamid, al, tusi, al, ghazali, the, shafi, ite, jurist, was, in, his, later, years, without, rival, and, the, jurist, al, yafi, i, stated, he, was, called, the, proof, of, islam, and, undoubtedly, was, worthy, of, the, name, absolutely, trustworthy, in, respect, of, the, faith, how, many, an, epitome, has, he, given, us, setting, forth, the, basic, principles, of, religion, how, much, that, was, repetitive, has, he, summarised, and, epitomised, what, was, lengthy, how, many, a, simple, explanation, has, he, given, us, of, what, was, hard, to, fathom, with, brief, elucidation, and, clear, solution, of, knotty, problems, he, used, moderation, being, quiet, but, decisive, in, silencing, an, adversary, though, his, words, were, like, a, sharp, sword, thrust, in, refuting, a, slanderer, and, protecting, the, high, road, of, guidance, the, shafi, i, jurist, al, subki, stated, if, there, had, been, a, prophet, after, muhammad, al, ghazali, would, have, been, the, man, also, a, widely, considered, sunni, scholar, al, dhahabi, in, his, praise, of, al, ghazali, wrote, al, ghazzaali, the, imaam, and, shaykh, the, prominent, scholar, hujjat, al, islam, the, wonder, of, his, time, zayn, al, deen, abu, haamid, muhammad, ibn, muhammad, ibn, muhammad, ibn, ahmad, al, toosi, al, shaafa, i, al, ghazzaali, the, author, of, many, books, and, one, possessed, of, utter, intelligence, he, studied, fiqh, in, his, own, town, then, he, moved, to, nisapur, in, the, company, of, a, group, of, students, he, stayed, with, the, imaam, al, haramayn, and, gained, a, deep, knowledge, of, fiqh, within, a, short, period, he, became, well, versed, in, ilm, al, kalaam, and, debate, until, he, became, the, best, of, debater, ibn, rushd, averroes, a, rationalist, famously, responded, that, to, say, that, philosophers, are, incoherent, is, itself, to, make, an, incoherent, statement, rushd, s, book, the, incoherence, of, the, incoherence, attempted, to, refute, al, ghazali, s, views, but, the, work, was, not, well, received, in, the, muslim, community, according, to, historian, firas, alkhateeb, when, one, reads, imam, al, ghazali, s, works, at, a, very, superficial, level, one, can, easily, misunderstand, what, he, is, saying, as, anti, scientific, in, general, the, truth, however, is, that, al, ghazali, s, only, warning, to, students, is, to, not, fully, accept, all, the, beliefs, and, ideas, of, a, scholar, simply, because, of, his, achievements, in, mathematics, and, science, by, issuing, such, a, warning, al, ghazali, is, in, fact, protecting, the, scientific, enterprise, for, future, generations, by, insulating, it, from, being, mixed, with, theoretical, philosophy, that, could, eventually, dilute, science, itself, to, a, field, based, on, conjecture, and, reasoning, alone, al, ghazali, has, been, seen, by, orientalist, scholars, as, causing, a, decline, in, scientific, advancement, in, islam, because, of, his, refutation, of, the, new, philosophies, of, his, time, he, purportedly, saw, danger, in, the, statements, made, by, philosophers, that, suggested, that, god, was, not, all, knowing, or, even, non, existent, which, strongly, contradicted, his, conservative, islamic, belief, this, position, has, been, challenged, however, the, following, statement, made, by, al, ghazali, has, been, described, as, evidence, that, he, was, not, against, scientific, advancement, great, indeed, is, the, crime, against, religion, committed, by, anyone, who, supposes, that, islam, is, to, be, championed, by, the, denial, of, mathematical, sciences, this, sentence, the, source, of, which, is, not, indicated, in, the, cited, book, is, taken, from, deliverance, from, error, ghazali, does, not, mean, that, neglecting, the, study, of, mathematics, would, be, a, crime, against, science, or, against, reason, but, that, rejecting, them, is, a, crime, against, religion, its, aim, is, not, to, promote, the, study, of, mathematics, it, is, to, condemn, the, attitude, which, consists, in, considering, them, as, rivals, of, religion, for, him, religion, has, nothing, to, fear, from, them, because, they, do, not, deal, with, the, same, subjects, to, condemn, the, study, of, mathematics, for, fear, that, it, endangers, religion, is, to, mistake, the, place, of, each, of, them, this, is, clarified, by, the, sentence, which, immediately, follows, for, the, revealed, law, nowhere, undertakes, to, deny, or, affirm, these, sciences, and, the, latter, nowhere, address, themselves, to, religious, matters, a, few, pages, later, he, writes, that, the, books, of, the, philosophers, must, be, banned, he, defines, philosophy, as, composed, of, six, branches, mathematical, logical, physical, metaphysical, political, and, morale, al, ghazali,
