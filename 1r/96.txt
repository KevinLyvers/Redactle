the, spanish, renaissance, el, greco, was, a, nickname, and, the, artist, normally, signed, his, paintings, with, his, full, birth, name, in, greek, letters, often, adding, the, word, kr, s, which, means, cretan, in, ancient, greek, el, greco, was, born, in, the, kingdom, of, candia, modern, crete, which, was, at, that, time, part, of, the, republic, of, venice, italy, and, the, center, of, post, byzantine, art, he, trained, and, became, a, master, within, that, tradition, before, traveling, at, age, 26, to, venice, as, other, greek, artists, had, done, in, 1570, he, moved, to, rome, where, he, opened, a, workshop, and, executed, a, series, of, works, during, his, stay, in, italy, el, greco, enriched, his, style, with, elements, of, mannerism, and, of, the, venetian, renaissance, taken, from, a, number, of, great, artists, of, the, time, notably, tintoretto, and, titian, in, 1577, he, moved, to, toledo, spain, where, he, lived, and, worked, until, his, death, in, toledo, el, greco, received, several, major, commissions, and, produced, his, best, known, paintings, such, as, view, of, toledo, and, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, el, greco, s, dramatic, and, expressionistic, style, was, met, with, puzzlement, by, his, contemporaries, but, found, appreciation, by, the, 20th, century, el, greco, is, regarded, as, a, precursor, of, both, expressionism, and, cubism, while, his, personality, and, works, were, a, source, of, inspiration, for, poets, and, writers, such, as, rainer, maria, rilke, and, nikos, kazantzakis, el, greco, has, been, characterized, by, modern, scholars, as, an, artist, so, individual, that, he, belongs, to, no, conventional, school, he, is, best, known, for, tortuously, elongated, figures, and, often, fantastic, or, phantasmagorical, pigmentation, marrying, byzantine, traditions, with, those, of, western, painting, born, in, 1541, in, either, the, village, of, fodele, or, candia, the, venetian, name, of, chandax, present, day, heraklion, on, crete, el, greco, was, descended, from, a, prosperous, urban, family, which, had, probably, been, driven, out, of, chania, to, candia, after, an, uprising, against, the, catholic, venetians, between, 1526, and, 1528, el, greco, s, father, ge, rgios, theotok, poulos, d, 1556, was, a, merchant, and, tax, collector, almost, nothing, is, known, about, his, mother, or, his, first, wife, except, that, they, were, also, greek, his, second, wife, was, a, spaniard, el, greco, s, older, brother, mano, ssos, theotok, poulos, 1531, 1604, was, a, wealthy, merchant, and, spent, the, last, years, of, his, life, 1603, 1604, in, el, greco, s, toledo, home, el, greco, received, his, initial, training, as, an, icon, painter, of, the, cretan, school, a, leading, center, of, post, byzantine, art, in, addition, to, painting, he, probably, studied, the, classics, of, ancient, greece, and, perhaps, the, latin, classics, also, he, left, a, working, library, of, 130, volumes, at, his, death, including, the, bible, in, greek, and, an, annotated, vasari, book, candia, was, a, center, for, artistic, activity, where, eastern, and, western, cultures, co, existed, harmoniously, where, around, two, hundred, painters, were, active, during, the, 16th, century, and, had, organized, a, painters, guild, based, on, the, italian, model, in, 1563, at, the, age, of, twenty, two, el, greco, was, described, in, a, document, as, a, master, maestro, domenigo, meaning, he, was, already, a, master, of, the, guild, and, presumably, operating, his, own, workshop, three, years, later, in, june, 1566, as, a, witness, to, a, contract, he, signed, his, name, in, greek, as, ma, stros, m, negos, theotok, poulos, sgour, fos, master, m, negos, theotok, poulos, painter, most, scholars, believe, that, the, theotok, poulos, family, was, almost, certainly, greek, orthodox, although, some, catholic, sources, still, claim, him, from, birth, like, many, orthodox, emigrants, to, catholic, areas, of, europe, some, assert, that, he, may, have, transferred, to, catholicism, after, his, arrival, and, possibly, practiced, as, a, catholic, in, spain, where, he, described, himself, as, a, devout, catholic, in, his, will, the, extensive, archival, research, conducted, since, the, early, 1960s, by, scholars, such, as, nikolaos, panayotakis, pandelis, prevelakis, and, maria, constantoudaki, indicates, strongly, that, el, greco, s, family, and, ancestors, were, greek, orthodox, one, of, his, uncles, was, an, orthodox, priest, and, his, name, is, not, mentioned, in, the, catholic, archival, baptismal, records, on, crete, prevelakis, goes, even, further, expressing, his, doubt, that, el, greco, was, ever, a, practicing, roman, catholic, important, for, his, early, biography, el, greco, still, in, crete, painted, his, dormition, of, the, virgin, near, the, end, of, his, cretan, period, probably, before, 1567, three, other, signed, works, of, dom, nicos, are, attributed, to, el, greco, modena, triptych, st, luke, painting, the, virgin, and, child, and, the, adoration, of, the, magi, it, was, natural, for, the, young, el, greco, to, pursue, his, career, in, venice, crete, having, been, a, possession, of, the, republic, of, venice, since, 1211, though, the, exact, year, is, not, clear, most, scholars, agree, that, el, greco, went, to, venice, around, 1567, knowledge, of, el, greco, s, years, in, italy, is, limited, he, lived, in, venice, until, 1570, and, according, to, a, letter, written, by, his, much, older, friend, the, greatest, miniaturist, of, the, age, giulio, clovio, was, a, disciple, of, titian, who, was, by, then, in, his, eighties, but, still, vigorous, this, may, mean, he, worked, in, titian, s, large, studio, or, not, clovio, characterized, el, greco, as, a, rare, talent, in, painting, in, 1570, el, greco, moved, to, rome, where, he, executed, a, series, of, works, strongly, marked, by, his, venetian, apprenticeship, it, is, unknown, how, long, he, remained, in, rome, though, he, may, have, returned, to, venice, c, 1575, 76, before, he, left, for, spain, in, rome, on, the, recommendation, of, giulio, clovio, el, greco, was, received, as, a, guest, at, the, palazzo, farnese, which, cardinal, alessandro, farnese, had, made, a, center, of, the, artistic, and, intellectual, life, of, the, city, there, he, came, into, contact, with, the, intellectual, elite, of, the, city, including, the, roman, scholar, fulvio, orsini, whose, collection, would, later, include, seven, paintings, by, the, artist, view, of, mt, sinai, and, a, portrait, of, clovio, are, among, them, unlike, other, cretan, artists, who, had, moved, to, venice, el, greco, substantially, altered, his, style, and, sought, to, distinguish, himself, by, inventing, new, and, unusual, interpretations, of, traditional, religious, subject, matter, his, works, painted, in, italy, were, influenced, by, the, venetian, renaissance, style, of, the, period, with, agile, elongated, figures, reminiscent, of, tintoretto, and, a, chromatic, framework, that, connects, him, to, titian, the, venetian, painters, also, taught, him, to, organize, his, multi, figured, compositions, in, landscapes, vibrant, with, atmospheric, light, clovio, reports, visiting, el, greco, on, a, summer, s, day, while, the, artist, was, still, in, rome, el, greco, was, sitting, in, a, darkened, room, because, he, found, the, darkness, more, conducive, to, thought, than, the, light, of, the, day, which, disturbed, his, inner, light, as, a, result, of, his, stay, in, rome, his, works, were, enriched, with, elements, such, as, violent, perspective, vanishing, points, or, strange, attitudes, struck, by, the, figures, with, their, repeated, twisting, and, turning, and, tempestuous, gestures, all, elements, of, mannerism, by, the, time, el, greco, arrived, in, rome, michelangelo, and, raphael, were, dead, but, their, example, continued, to, be, paramount, and, somewhat, overwhelming, for, young, painters, el, greco, was, determined, to, make, his, own, mark, in, rome, defending, his, personal, artistic, views, ideas, and, style, he, singled, out, correggio, and, parmigianino, for, particular, praise, but, he, did, not, hesitate, to, dismiss, michelangelo, s, last, judgment, in, the, sistine, chapel, he, extended, an, offer, to, pope, pius, v, to, paint, over, the, whole, work, in, accord, with, the, new, and, stricter, catholic, thinking, when, he, was, later, asked, what, he, thought, about, michelangelo, el, greco, replied, that, he, was, a, good, man, but, he, did, not, know, how, to, paint, however, despite, el, greco, s, criticism, michelangelo, s, influence, can, be, seen, in, later, el, greco, works, such, as, the, allegory, of, the, holy, league, by, painting, portraits, of, michelangelo, titian, clovio, and, presumably, raphael, in, one, of, his, works, the, purification, of, the, temple, el, greco, not, only, expressed, his, gratitude, but, also, advanced, the, claim, to, rival, these, masters, as, his, own, commentaries, indicate, el, greco, viewed, titian, michelangelo, and, raphael, as, models, to, emulate, in, his, 17th, century, chronicles, giulio, mancini, included, el, greco, among, the, painters, who, had, initiated, in, various, ways, a, re, evaluation, of, michelangelo, s, teachings, because, of, his, unconventional, artistic, beliefs, such, as, his, dismissal, of, michelangelo, s, technique, and, personality, el, greco, soon, acquired, enemies, in, rome, architect, and, writer, pirro, ligorio, called, him, a, foolish, foreigner, and, newly, discovered, archival, material, reveals, a, skirmish, with, farnese, who, obliged, the, young, artist, to, leave, his, palace, on, 6, july, 1572, el, greco, officially, complained, about, this, event, a, few, months, later, on, 18, september, 1572, he, paid, his, dues, to, the, guild, of, saint, luke, in, rome, as, a, miniature, painter, at, the, end, of, that, year, el, greco, opened, his, own, workshop, and, hired, as, assistants, the, painters, lattanzio, bonastri, de, lucignano, and, francisco, preboste, in, 1577, el, greco, migrated, to, madrid, and, then, to, toledo, where, he, produced, his, mature, works, at, the, time, toledo, was, the, religious, capital, of, spain, and, a, populous, city, with, an, illustrious, past, a, prosperous, present, and, an, uncertain, future, in, rome, el, greco, had, earned, the, respect, of, some, intellectuals, but, was, also, facing, the, hostility, of, certain, art, critics, during, the, 1570s, the, huge, monastery, palace, of, el, escorial, was, still, under, construction, and, philip, ii, of, spain, was, experiencing, difficulties, in, finding, good, artists, for, the, many, large, paintings, required, to, decorate, it, titian, was, dead, and, tintoretto, veronese, and, anthonis, mor, all, refused, to, come, to, spain, philip, had, to, rely, on, the, lesser, talent, of, juan, fern, ndez, de, navarrete, of, whose, gravedad, y, decoro, seriousness, and, decorum, the, king, approved, when, fern, ndez, died, in, 1579, the, moment, was, ideal, for, el, greco, to, move, to, toledo, through, clovio, and, orsini, el, greco, met, benito, arias, montano, a, spanish, humanist, and, agent, of, philip, pedro, chac, n, a, clergyman, and, luis, de, castilla, son, of, diego, de, castilla, the, dean, of, the, cathedral, of, toledo, el, greco, s, friendship, with, castilla, would, secure, his, first, large, commissions, in, toledo, he, arrived, in, toledo, by, july, 1577, and, signed, contracts, for, a, group, of, paintings, that, was, to, adorn, the, church, of, santo, domingo, el, antiguo, in, toledo, and, for, the, renowned, el, espolio, by, september, 1579, he, had, completed, nine, paintings, for, santo, domingo, including, the, trinity, and, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, these, works, would, establish, the, painter, s, reputation, in, toledo, el, greco, did, not, plan, to, settle, permanently, in, toledo, since, his, final, aim, was, to, win, the, favor, of, philip, and, make, his, mark, in, his, court, indeed, he, did, manage, to, secure, two, important, commissions, from, the, monarch, allegory, of, the, holy, league, and, martyrdom, of, st, maurice, however, the, king, did, not, like, these, works, and, placed, the, st, maurice, altarpiece, in, the, chapter, house, rather, than, the, intended, chapel, he, gave, no, further, commissions, to, el, greco, the, exact, reasons, for, the, king, s, dissatisfaction, remain, unclear, some, scholars, have, suggested, that, philip, did, not, like, the, inclusion, of, living, persons, in, a, religious, scene, some, others, that, el, greco, s, works, violated, a, basic, rule, of, the, counter, reformation, namely, that, in, the, image, the, content, was, paramount, rather, than, the, style, philip, took, a, close, interest, in, his, artistic, commissions, and, had, very, decided, tastes, a, long, sought, after, sculpted, crucifixion, by, benvenuto, cellini, also, failed, to, please, when, it, arrived, and, was, likewise, exiled, to, a, less, prominent, place, philip, s, next, experiment, with, federico, zuccari, was, even, less, successful, in, any, case, philip, s, dissatisfaction, ended, any, hopes, of, royal, patronage, el, greco, may, have, had, lacking, the, favor, of, the, king, el, greco, was, obliged, to, remain, in, toledo, where, he, had, been, received, in, 1577, as, a, great, painter, according, to, hortensio, f, lix, paravicino, a, 17th, century, spanish, preacher, and, poet, crete, gave, him, life, and, the, painter, s, craft, toledo, a, better, homeland, where, through, death, he, began, to, achieve, eternal, life, in, 1585, he, appears, to, have, hired, an, assistant, italian, painter, francisco, preboste, and, to, have, established, a, workshop, capable, of, producing, altar, frames, and, statues, as, well, as, paintings, on, 12, march, 1586, he, obtained, the, commission, for, the, burial, of, the, count, of, orgaz, now, his, best, known, work, the, decade, 1597, to, 1607, was, a, period, of, intense, activity, for, el, greco, during, these, years, he, received, several, major, commissions, and, his, workshop, created, pictorial, and, sculptural, ensembles, for, a, variety, of, religious, institutions, among, his, major, commissions, of, this, period, were, three, altars, for, the, chapel, of, san, jos, in, toledo, 1597, 1599, three, paintings, 1596, 1600, for, the, colegio, de, do, a, mar, a, de, aragon, an, augustinian, monastery, in, madrid, and, the, high, altar, four, lateral, altars, and, the, painting, st, ildefonso, for, the, capilla, mayor, of, the, hospital, de, la, caridad, hospital, of, charity, at, illescas, 1603, 1605, the, minutes, of, the, commission, of, the, virgin, of, the, immaculate, conception, 1607, 1613, which, were, composed, by, the, personnel, of, the, municipality, describe, el, greco, as, one, of, the, greatest, men, in, both, this, kingdom, and, outside, it, between, 1607, and, 1608, el, greco, was, involved, in, a, protracted, legal, dispute, with, the, authorities, of, the, hospital, of, charity, at, illescas, concerning, payment, for, his, work, which, included, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, this, and, other, legal, disputes, contributed, to, the, economic, difficulties, he, experienced, towards, the, end, of, his, life, in, 1608, he, received, his, last, major, commission, at, the, hospital, of, saint, john, the, baptist, in, toledo, el, greco, made, toledo, his, home, surviving, contracts, mention, him, as, the, tenant, from, 1585, onwards, of, a, complex, consisting, of, three, apartments, and, twenty, four, rooms, which, belonged, to, the, marquis, de, villena, it, was, in, these, apartments, which, also, served, as, his, workshop, that, he, spent, the, rest, of, his, life, painting, and, studying, he, lived, in, considerable, style, sometimes, employing, musicians, to, play, whilst, he, dined, it, is, not, confirmed, whether, he, lived, with, his, spanish, female, companion, jer, nima, de, las, cuevas, whom, he, probably, never, married, she, was, the, mother, of, his, only, son, jorge, manuel, born, in, 1578, who, also, became, a, painter, assisted, his, father, and, continued, to, repeat, his, compositions, for, many, years, after, he, inherited, the, studio, in, 1604, jorge, manuel, and, alfonsa, de, los, morales, gave, birth, to, el, greco, s, grandson, gabriel, who, was, baptized, by, gregorio, angulo, governor, of, toledo, and, a, personal, friend, of, the, artist, during, the, course, of, the, execution, of, a, commission, for, the, hospital, de, tavera, el, greco, fell, seriously, ill, and, died, a, month, later, on, 7, april, 1614, a, few, days, earlier, on, 31, march, he, had, directed, that, his, son, should, have, the, power, to, make, his, will, two, greeks, friends, of, the, painter, witnessed, this, last, will, and, testament, el, greco, never, lost, touch, with, his, greek, origins, he, was, buried, in, the, church, of, santo, domingo, el, antiguo, aged, 73, the, primacy, of, imagination, and, intuition, over, the, subjective, character, of, creation, was, a, fundamental, principle, of, el, greco, s, style, el, greco, discarded, classicist, criteria, such, as, measure, and, proportion, he, believed, that, grace, is, the, supreme, quest, of, art, but, the, painter, achieves, grace, only, by, managing, to, solve, the, most, complex, problems, with, ease, el, greco, regarded, color, as, the, most, important, and, the, most, ungovernable, element, of, painting, and, declared, that, color, had, primacy, over, form, francisco, pacheco, a, painter, and, theoretician, who, visited, el, greco, in, 1611, wrote, that, the, painter, liked, the, colors, crude, and, unmixed, in, great, blots, as, a, boastful, display, of, his, dexterity, and, that, he, believed, in, constant, repainting, and, retouching, in, order, to, make, the, broad, masses, tell, flat, as, in, nature, i, hold, the, imitation, of, color, to, be, the, greatest, difficulty, of, art, el, greco, from, notes, of, the, painter, in, one, of, his, commentaries, art, historian, max, dvo, k, was, the, first, scholar, to, connect, el, greco, s, art, with, mannerism, and, antinaturalism, modern, scholars, characterize, el, greco, s, theory, as, typically, mannerist, and, pinpoint, its, sources, in, the, neoplatonism, of, the, renaissance, jonathan, brown, believes, that, el, greco, created, a, sophisticated, form, of, art, according, to, nicholas, penny, once, in, spain, el, greco, was, able, to, create, a, style, of, his, own, one, that, disavowed, most, of, the, descriptive, ambitions, of, painting, in, his, mature, works, el, greco, demonstrated, a, characteristic, tendency, to, dramatize, rather, than, to, describe, the, strong, spiritual, emotion, transfers, from, painting, directly, to, the, audience, according, to, pacheco, el, greco, s, perturbed, violent, and, at, times, seemingly, careless, in, execution, art, was, due, to, a, studied, effort, to, acquire, a, freedom, of, style, el, greco, s, preference, for, exceptionally, tall, and, slender, figures, and, elongated, compositions, which, served, both, his, expressive, purposes, and, aesthetic, principles, led, him, to, disregard, the, laws, of, nature, and, elongate, his, compositions, to, ever, greater, extents, particularly, when, they, were, destined, for, altarpieces, the, anatomy, of, the, human, body, becomes, even, more, otherworldly, in, el, greco, s, mature, works, for, the, immaculate, conception, el, greco, toledo, el, greco, asked, to, lengthen, the, altarpiece, itself, by, another, 1, 5, ft, 0, 46, m, because, in, this, way, the, form, will, be, perfect, and, not, reduced, which, is, the, worst, thing, that, can, happen, to, a, figure, a, significant, innovation, of, el, greco, s, mature, works, is, the, interweaving, between, form, and, space, a, reciprocal, relationship, is, developed, between, the, two, which, completely, unifies, the, painting, surface, this, interweaving, would, re, emerge, three, centuries, later, in, the, works, of, c, zanne, and, picasso, another, characteristic, of, el, greco, s, mature, style, is, the, use, of, light, as, jonathan, brown, notes, each, figure, seems, to, carry, its, own, light, within, or, reflects, the, light, that, emanates, from, an, unseen, source, fernando, marias, and, agust, n, bustamante, garc, a, the, scholars, who, transcribed, el, greco, s, handwritten, notes, connect, the, power, that, the, painter, gives, to, light, with, the, ideas, underlying, christian, neo, platonism, modern, scholarly, research, emphasizes, the, importance, of, toledo, for, the, complete, development, of, el, greco, s, mature, style, and, stresses, the, painter, s, ability, to, adjust, his, style, in, accordance, with, his, surroundings, harold, wethey, asserts, that, although, greek, by, descent, and, italian, by, artistic, preparation, the, artist, became, so, immersed, in, the, religious, environment, of, spain, that, he, became, the, most, vital, visual, representative, of, spanish, mysticism, he, believes, that, in, el, greco, s, mature, works, the, devotional, intensity, of, mood, reflects, the, religious, spirit, of, roman, catholic, spain, in, the, period, of, the, counter, reformation, el, greco, also, excelled, as, a, portraitist, able, not, only, to, record, a, sitter, s, features, but, also, to, convey, their, character, his, portraits, are, fewer, in, number, than, his, religious, paintings, but, are, of, equally, high, quality, wethey, says, that, by, such, simple, means, the, artist, created, a, memorable, characterization, that, places, him, in, the, highest, rank, as, a, portraitist, along, with, titian, and, rembrandt, el, greco, painted, many, of, his, paintings, on, fine, canvas, and, employed, a, viscous, oil, medium, he, painted, with, the, usual, pigments, of, his, period, such, as, azurite, lead, tin, yellow, vermilion, madder, lake, ochres, and, red, lead, but, he, seldom, used, the, expensive, natural, ultramarine, since, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, scholars, have, debated, whether, el, greco, s, style, had, byzantine, origins, certain, art, historians, had, asserted, that, el, greco, s, roots, were, firmly, in, the, byzantine, tradition, and, that, his, most, individual, characteristics, derive, directly, from, the, art, of, his, ancestors, while, others, had, argued, that, byzantine, art, could, not, be, related, to, el, greco, s, later, work, i, would, not, be, happy, to, see, a, beautiful, well, proportioned, woman, no, matter, from, which, point, of, view, however, extravagant, not, only, lose, her, beauty, in, order, to, i, would, say, increase, in, size, according, to, the, law, of, vision, but, no, longer, appear, beautiful, and, in, fact, become, monstrous, el, greco, from, marginalia, the, painter, inscribed, in, his, copy, of, daniele, barbaro, s, translation, of, vitruvius, de, architectura, the, discovery, of, the, dormition, of, the, virgin, on, syros, an, authentic, and, signed, work, from, the, painter, s, cretan, period, and, the, extensive, archival, research, in, the, early, 1960s, contributed, to, the, rekindling, and, reassessment, of, these, theories, although, following, many, conventions, of, the, byzantine, icon, aspects, of, the, style, certainly, show, venetian, influence, and, the, composition, showing, the, death, of, mary, combines, the, different, doctrines, of, the, orthodox, dormition, of, the, virgin, and, the, catholic, assumption, of, the, virgin, significant, scholarly, works, of, the, second, half, of, the, 20th, century, devoted, to, el, greco, reappraise, many, of, the, interpretations, of, his, work, including, his, supposed, byzantinism, based, on, the, notes, written, in, el, greco, s, own, hand, on, his, unique, style, and, on, the, fact, that, el, greco, signed, his, name, in, greek, characters, they, see, an, organic, continuity, between, byzantine, painting, and, his, art, according, to, marina, lambraki, plaka, far, from, the, influence, of, italy, in, a, neutral, place, which, was, intellectually, similar, to, his, birthplace, candia, the, byzantine, elements, of, his, education, emerged, and, played, a, catalytic, role, in, the, new, conception, of, the, image, which, is, presented, to, us, in, his, mature, work, in, making, this, judgement, lambraki, plaka, disagrees, with, oxford, university, professors, cyril, mango, and, elizabeth, jeffreys, who, assert, that, despite, claims, to, the, contrary, the, only, byzantine, element, of, his, famous, paintings, was, his, signature, in, greek, lettering, nikos, hadjinikolaou, states, that, from, 1570, el, greco, s, painting, is, neither, byzantine, nor, post, byzantine, but, western, european, the, works, he, produced, in, italy, belong, to, the, history, of, the, italian, art, and, those, he, produced, in, spain, to, the, history, of, spanish, art, the, english, art, historian, david, davies, seeks, the, roots, of, el, greco, s, style, in, the, intellectual, sources, of, his, greek, christian, education, and, in, the, world, of, his, recollections, from, the, liturgical, and, ceremonial, aspect, of, the, orthodox, church, davies, believes, that, the, religious, climate, of, the, counter, reformation, and, the, aesthetics, of, mannerism, acted, as, catalysts, to, activate, his, individual, technique, he, asserts, that, the, philosophies, of, platonism, and, ancient, neo, platonism, the, works, of, plotinus, and, pseudo, dionysius, the, areopagite, the, texts, of, the, church, fathers, and, the, liturgy, offer, the, keys, to, the, understanding, of, el, greco, s, style, summarizing, the, ensuing, scholarly, debate, on, this, issue, jos, lvarez, lopera, curator, at, the, museo, del, prado, madrid, concludes, that, the, presence, of, byzantine, memories, is, obvious, in, el, greco, s, mature, works, though, there, are, still, some, obscure, issues, concerning, his, byzantine, origins, needing, further, illumination, el, greco, was, highly, esteemed, as, an, architect, and, sculptor, during, his, lifetime, he, usually, designed, complete, altar, compositions, working, as, architect, and, sculptor, as, well, as, painter, at, for, instance, the, hospital, de, la, caridad, there, he, decorated, the, chapel, of, the, hospital, but, the, wooden, altar, and, the, sculptures, he, created, have, in, all, probability, perished, for, el, espolio, the, master, designed, the, original, altar, of, gilded, wood, which, has, been, destroyed, but, his, small, sculptured, group, of, the, miracle, of, st, ildefonso, still, survives, on, the, lower, center, of, the, frame, his, most, important, architectural, achievement, was, the, church, and, monastery, of, santo, domingo, el, antiguo, for, which, he, also, executed, sculptures, and, paintings, el, greco, is, regarded, as, a, painter, who, incorporated, architecture, in, his, painting, he, is, also, credited, with, the, architectural, frames, to, his, own, paintings, in, toledo, pacheco, characterized, him, as, a, writer, of, painting, sculpture, and, architecture, in, the, marginalia, that, el, greco, inscribed, in, his, copy, of, daniele, barbaro, s, translation, of, vitruvius, de, architectura, he, refuted, vitruvius, attachment, to, archaeological, remains, canonical, proportions, perspective, and, mathematics, he, also, saw, vitruvius, manner, of, distorting, proportions, in, order, to, compensate, for, distance, from, the, eye, as, responsible, for, creating, monstrous, forms, el, greco, was, averse, to, the, very, idea, of, rules, in, architecture, he, believed, above, all, in, the, freedom, of, invention, and, defended, novelty, variety, and, complexity, these, ideas, were, however, far, too, extreme, for, the, architectural, circles, of, his, era, and, had, no, immediate, resonance, el, greco, was, disdained, by, the, immediate, generations, after, his, death, because, his, work, was, opposed, in, many, respects, to, the, principles, of, the, early, baroque, style, which, came, to, the, fore, near, the, beginning, of, the, 17th, century, and, soon, supplanted, the, last, surviving, traits, of, the, 16th, century, mannerism, el, greco, was, deemed, incomprehensible, and, had, no, important, followers, only, his, son, and, a, few, unknown, painters, produced, weak, copies, of, his, works, late, 17th, and, early, 18th, century, spanish, commentators, praised, his, skill, but, criticized, his, antinaturalistic, style, and, his, complex, iconography, some, of, these, commentators, such, as, antonio, palomino, and, juan, agust, n, ce, n, berm, dez, described, his, mature, work, as, contemptible, ridiculous, and, worthy, of, scorn, the, views, of, palomino, and, berm, dez, were, frequently, repeated, in, spanish, historiography, adorned, with, terms, such, as, strange, queer, original, eccentric, and, odd, the, phrase, sunk, in, eccentricity, often, encountered, in, such, texts, in, time, developed, into, madness, with, the, arrival, of, romantic, sentiments, in, the, late, 18th, century, el, greco, s, works, were, examined, anew, to, french, writer, th, ophile, gautier, el, greco, was, the, precursor, of, the, european, romantic, movement, in, all, its, craving, for, the, strange, and, the, extreme, gautier, regarded, el, greco, as, the, ideal, romantic, hero, the, gifted, the, misunderstood, the, mad, and, was, the, first, who, explicitly, expressed, his, admiration, for, el, greco, s, later, technique, french, art, critics, zacharie, astruc, and, paul, lefort, helped, to, promote, a, widespread, revival, of, interest, in, his, painting, in, the, 1890s, spanish, painters, living, in, paris, adopted, him, as, their, guide, and, mentor, however, in, the, popular, english, speaking, imagination, he, remained, the, man, who, painted, horrors, in, the, escorial, in, the, words, of, ephraim, chambers, cyclopaedia, in, 1899, in, 1908, spanish, art, historian, manuel, bartolom, coss, o, published, the, first, comprehensive, catalogue, of, el, greco, s, works, in, this, book, el, greco, was, presented, as, the, founder, of, the, spanish, school, the, same, year, julius, meier, graefe, a, scholar, of, french, impressionism, traveled, in, spain, expecting, to, study, vel, squez, but, instead, becoming, fascinated, by, el, greco, he, recorded, his, experiences, in, spanische, reise, spanish, journey, published, in, english, in, 1926, the, book, which, widely, established, el, greco, as, a, great, painter, of, the, past, outside, a, somewhat, narrow, circle, in, el, greco, s, work, meier, graefe, found, foreshadowing, of, modernity, these, are, the, words, meier, graefe, used, to, describe, el, greco, s, impact, on, the, artistic, movements, of, his, time, he, has, discovered, a, realm, of, new, possibilities, not, even, he, himself, was, able, to, exhaust, them, all, the, generations, that, follow, after, him, live, in, his, realm, there, is, a, greater, difference, between, him, and, titian, his, master, than, between, him, and, renoir, or, c, zanne, nevertheless, renoir, and, c, zanne, are, masters, of, impeccable, originality, because, it, is, not, possible, to, avail, yourself, of, el, greco, s, language, if, in, using, it, it, is, not, invented, again, and, again, by, the, user, to, the, english, artist, and, critic, roger, fry, in, 1920, el, greco, was, the, archetypal, genius, who, did, as, he, thought, best, with, complete, indifference, to, what, effect, the, right, expression, might, have, on, the, public, fry, described, el, greco, as, an, old, master, who, is, not, merely, modern, but, actually, appears, a, good, many, steps, ahead, of, us, turning, back, to, show, us, the, way, during, the, same, period, other, researchers, developed, alternative, more, radical, theories, the, ophthalmologists, august, goldschmidt, and, germ, n, beritens, argued, that, el, greco, painted, such, elongated, human, figures, because, he, had, vision, problems, possibly, progressive, astigmatism, or, strabismus, that, made, him, see, bodies, longer, than, they, were, and, at, an, angle, to, the, perpendicular, the, physician, arturo, perera, however, attributed, this, style, to, the, use, of, marijuana, michael, kimmelman, a, reviewer, for, the, new, york, times, stated, that, to, greeks, became, the, quintessential, greek, painter, to, the, spanish, the, quintessential, spaniard, epitomizing, the, consensus, of, el, greco, s, impact, jimmy, carter, the, 39th, president, of, the, united, states, said, in, april, 1980, that, el, greco, was, the, most, extraordinary, painter, that, ever, came, along, back, then, and, that, he, was, maybe, three, or, four, centuries, ahead, of, his, time, according, to, efi, foundoulaki, painters, and, theoreticians, from, the, beginning, of, the, 20th, century, discovered, a, new, el, greco, but, in, process, they, also, discovered, and, revealed, their, own, selves, his, expressiveness, and, colors, influenced, eug, ne, delacroix, and, douard, manet, to, the, blaue, reiter, group, in, munich, in, 1912, el, greco, typified, that, mystical, inner, construction, that, it, was, the, task, of, their, generation, to, rediscover, the, first, painter, who, appears, to, have, noticed, the, structural, code, in, the, morphology, of, the, mature, el, greco, was, paul, c, zanne, one, of, the, forerunners, of, cubism, comparative, morphological, analyses, of, the, two, painters, revealed, their, common, elements, such, as, the, distortion, of, the, human, body, the, reddish, and, in, appearance, only, unworked, backgrounds, and, the, similarities, in, the, rendering, of, space, according, to, brown, c, zanne, and, el, greco, are, spiritual, brothers, despite, the, centuries, which, separate, them, fry, observed, that, c, zanne, drew, from, his, great, discovery, of, the, permeation, of, every, part, of, the, design, with, a, uniform, and, continuous, plastic, theme, the, symbolists, and, pablo, picasso, during, his, blue, period, drew, on, the, cold, tonality, of, el, greco, utilizing, the, anatomy, of, his, ascetic, figures, while, picasso, was, working, on, his, proto, cubist, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, he, visited, his, friend, ignacio, zuloaga, in, his, studio, in, paris, and, studied, el, greco, s, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, owned, by, zuloaga, since, 1897, the, relation, between, les, demoiselles, d, avignon, and, the, opening, of, the, fifth, seal, was, pinpointed, in, the, early, 1980s, when, the, stylistic, similarities, and, the, relationship, between, the, motifs, of, both, works, were, analysed, the, early, cubist, explorations, of, picasso, were, to, uncover, other, aspects, in, the, work, of, el, greco, structural, analysis, of, his, compositions, multi, faced, refraction, of, form, interweaving, of, form, and, space, and, special, effects, of, highlights, several, traits, of, cubism, such, as, distortions, and, the, materialistic, rendering, of, time, have, their, analogies, in, el, greco, s, work, according, to, picasso, el, greco, s, structure, is, cubist, on, 22, february, 1950, picasso, began, his, series, of, paraphrases, of, other, painters, works, with, the, portrait, of, a, painter, after, el, greco, foundoulaki, asserts, that, picasso, completed, the, process, for, the, activation, of, the, painterly, values, of, el, greco, which, had, been, started, by, manet, and, carried, on, by, c, zanne, the, expressionists, focused, on, the, expressive, distortions, of, el, greco, according, to, franz, marc, one, of, the, principal, painters, of, the, german, expressionist, movement, we, refer, with, pleasure, and, with, steadfastness, to, the, case, of, el, greco, because, the, glory, of, this, painter, is, closely, tied, to, the, evolution, of, our, new, perceptions, on, art, jackson, pollock, a, major, force, in, the, abstract, expressionist, movement, was, also, influenced, by, el, greco, by, 1943, pollock, had, completed, sixty, drawing, compositions, after, el, greco, and, owned, three, books, on, the, cretan, master, pollock, influenced, the, artist, joseph, glasco, s, interest, in, el, greco, s, art, glasco, created, several, contemporary, paintings, based, on, one, of, his, favorite, subjects, el, greco, s, view, of, toledo, kysa, johnson, used, el, greco, s, paintings, of, the, immaculate, conception, as, the, compositional, framework, for, some, of, her, works, and, the, master, s, anatomical, distortions, are, somewhat, reflected, in, fritz, chesnut, s, portraits, el, greco, s, personality, and, work, were, a, source, of, inspiration, for, poet, rainer, maria, rilke, one, set, of, rilke, s, poems, himmelfahrt, mariae, i, ii, 1913, was, based, directly, on, el, greco, s, immaculate, conception, greek, writer, nikos, kazantzakis, who, felt, a, great, spiritual, affinity, for, el, greco, called, his, autobiography, report, to, greco, and, wrote, a, tribute, to, the, cretan, born, artist, in, 1998, the, greek, electronic, composer, and, artist, vangelis, published, el, greco, a, symphonic, album, inspired, by, the, artist, this, album, is, an, expansion, of, an, earlier, album, by, vangelis, foros, timis, ston, greco, a, tribute, to, el, greco, the, life, of, the, cretan, born, artist, is, the, subject, of, the, film, el, greco, of, greek, spanish, and, british, production, directed, by, ioannis, smaragdis, the, film, began, shooting, in, october, 2006, on, the, island, of, crete, and, debuted, on, the, screen, one, year, later, british, actor, nick, ashdon, was, cast, to, play, el, greco, in, reference, to, el, greco, the, austrian, artist, matthias, laurenz, gr, ff, created, his, large, format, religious, triptych, weltenalegorie, world, allegory, in, 2009, which, contains, various, figures, from, el, greco, s, paintings, the, exact, number, of, el, greco, s, works, has, been, a, hotly, contested, issue, in, 1937, a, highly, influential, study, by, art, historian, rodolfo, pallucchini, had, the, effect, of, greatly, increasing, the, number, of, works, accepted, to, be, by, el, greco, pallucchini, attributed, to, el, greco, a, small, triptych, in, the, galleria, estense, at, modena, on, the, basis, of, a, signature, on, the, painting, on, the, back, of, the, central, panel, on, the, modena, triptych, created, by, the, hand, of, dom, nikos, there, was, consensus, that, the, triptych, was, indeed, an, early, work, of, el, greco, and, therefore, pallucchini, s, publication, became, the, yardstick, for, attributions, to, the, artist, nevertheless, wethey, denied, that, the, modena, triptych, had, any, connection, at, all, with, the, artist, and, in, 1962, produced, a, reactive, catalogue, raisonn, with, a, greatly, reduced, corpus, of, materials, whereas, art, historian, jos, cam, n, aznar, had, attributed, between, 787, and, 829, paintings, to, the, cretan, master, wethey, reduced, the, number, to, 285, authentic, works, and, halldor, s, hner, a, german, researcher, of, spanish, art, recognized, only, 137, wethey, and, other, scholars, rejected, the, notion, that, crete, took, any, part, in, his, formation, and, supported, the, elimination, of, a, series, of, works, from, el, greco, s, uvre, since, 1962, the, discovery, of, the, dormition, and, the, extensive, archival, research, has, gradually, convinced, scholars, that, wethey, s, assessments, were, not, entirely, correct, and, that, his, catalogue, decisions, may, have, distorted, the, perception, of, the, whole, nature, of, el, greco, s, origins, development, and, uvre, the, discovery, of, the, dormition, led, to, the, attribution, of, three, other, signed, works, of, dom, nicos, to, el, greco, modena, triptych, st, luke, painting, the, virgin, and, child, and, the, adoration, of, the, magi, and, then, to, the, acceptance, of, more, works, as, authentic, some, signed, some, not, such, as, the, passion, of, christ, piet, with, angels, painted, in, 1566, which, were, brought, into, the, group, of, early, works, of, el, greco, el, greco, is, now, seen, as, an, artist, with, a, formative, training, on, crete, a, series, of, works, illuminate, his, early, style, some, painted, while, he, was, still, on, crete, some, from, his, period, in, venice, and, some, from, his, subsequent, stay, in, rome, even, wethey, accepted, that, he, probably, had, painted, the, little, and, much, disputed, triptych, in, the, galleria, estense, at, modena, before, he, left, crete, nevertheless, disputes, over, the, exact, number, of, el, greco, s, authentic, works, remain, unresolved, and, the, status, of, wethey, s, catalogue, raisonn, is, at, the, center, of, these, disagreements, a, few, sculptures, including, epimetheus, and, pandora, have, been, attributed, to, el, greco, this, doubtful, attribution, is, based, on, the, testimony, of, pacheco, he, saw, in, el, greco, s, studio, a, series, of, figurines, but, these, may, have, been, merely, models, there, are, also, four, drawings, among, the, surviving, works, of, el, greco, three, of, them, are, preparatory, works, for, the, altarpiece, of, santo, domingo, el, antiguo, and, the, fourth, is, a, study, for, one, of, his, paintings, the, crucifixion, in, 2010, the, heirs, of, the, baron, mor, lipot, herzog, a, jewish, hungarian, art, collector, who, had, been, looted, by, the, nazis, filed, a, restitution, claim, for, el, greco, s, the, agony, in, the, garden, in, 2015, el, greco, s, portrait, of, a, gentleman, which, had, been, looted, by, the, nazis, from, german, jewish, art, collector, julius, priester, in, 1944, was, returned, to, his, heirs, after, it, surfaced, at, an, auction, with, a, fake, provenance, according, to, anne, webber, co, chair, of, the, commission, for, looted, art, in, europe, the, painting, s, provenance, had, been, scrubbed
