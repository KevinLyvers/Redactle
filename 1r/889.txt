about, ramana, maharshi, a, popular, image, of, him, as, a, person, who, spent, most, of, his, time, doing, nothing, except, sitting, silently, in, samadhi, is, highly, inaccurate, from, the, period,

maharshi, i, like, him, greatly, because, he, is, so, simple, and, modest, when, an, atmosphere, of, authentic, greatness, lies, so, palpably, around, him, because, he, makes, no, claims, to, occult, powers, and, hierophantic, knowledge, to, impress, the, mystery, loving, nature, of, his, countrymen, and, because, he, is, so, totally, without, any, traces, of, pretension, that, he, strongly, resists, every, effort, to, canonize, him, during, his, lifetime, while, staying, at, sri, ramanasramam, brunton, had, an, experience, of, a, sublimely, all, embracing, awareness, a, moment, of,

but, only, weakened, him, other, systems, of, medicine, were, then, tried, all, proved, fruitless, and, were, stopped, by, the, end, of, march, when, devotees, gave, up, all, hope, to, devotees, who,

days, to, get, one, final, glimpse, he, died, on, 14, april, 1950, at, 8, 47, p, m, at, the, same, time, a, shooting, star, was, seen, which, impressed, some, of, his, devotees, as, a, synchronicity, ramana, maharshi, was, and, is, regarded, by, many, as, an, outstanding, enlightened, being, he, was, considered, to, be, a, charismatic, person, and, attracted, many, devotees, some, of, whom, saw, him, as, an, avatar, and, the, embodiment, of, shiva, many, devotees, visited, ramana, maharshi, for, darshan, the, sight, of, a, holy, person, or, god, incarnate, which, is, advantageous, and, transmits, merit, according, to, flood, in, indian, religions, the, guru, is, akin, to, the, image, or, statue, of, a, deity, in, the, temple, and, both, possess, power, and, a, sacred, energy, according, to, osborne, ramana, maharshi, regarded, giving, darshan, as, his, task, in, life, and, said, that, he, had, to, be, accessible, to, all, who, came, even, during, his, terminal, illness, at, the, end, of, his, life, he, demanded, to, be, approachable, for, all, who, came, for, his, darshan, objects, being, touched, or, used, by, him, were, highly, valued, by, his, devotees, as, they, considered, it, to, be, prasad, and, that, it, passed, on, some, of, the, power, and, blessing, of, the, guru, to, them, people, also, tried, to, touch, his, feet, which, is, also, considered, darshana, when, one, devotee, asked, if, it, would, be, possible, to, prostrate, before, sri, ramana, maharshi, and, touch, his, feet, he, replied, the, real, feet, of, bhagavan, exist, only, in, the, heart, of, the, devotee, to, hold, onto, these, feet, incessantly, is, true, happiness, you, will, be, disappointed, if, you, hold, onto, my, physical, feet, because, one, day, this, physical, body, will, disappear, the, greatest, worship, is, worshipping, the, guru, s, feet, that, are, within, oneself, in, later, life, the, number, of, devotees, and, their, devotion, grew, so, large, that, ramana, maharshi, became, restricted, in, his, daily, routine, measures, had, to, be, taken, to, prevent, people, touching, him, several, times, ramana, maharshi, tried, to, escape, from, the, ashram, to, return, to, a, life, of, solitude, vasudeva, reports, bhagavan, sat, on, a, rock, and, said, with, tears, in, his, eyes, that, he, would, never, again, come, to, the, ashram, and, would, go, where, he, pleased, and, live, in, the, forests, or, caves, away, from, all, men, ramana, maharshi, did, return, to, the, ashram, but, has, also, reported, himself, on, attempts, to, leave, the, ashram, i, tried, to, be, free, on, a, third, occasion, also, that, was, after, mother, s, passing, away, i, did, not, want, to, have, even, an, ashram, like, skandashram, and, the, people, that, were, coming, there, then, but, the, result, has, been, this, ashram, and, all, the, crowd, here, thus, all, my, three, attempts, failed, some, of, ramana, maharshi, s, devotees, regarded, him, to, be, as, dakshinamurti, as, an, avatar, of, skanda, a, divine, form, of, shiva, popular, in, tamil, nadu, as, an, incarnation, of, jnana, sambandar, one, of, the, sixty, three, nayanars, and, as, an, incarnation, of, kum, rila, bha, a, the, 8th, century, mimamsa, philosopher, according, to, krishna, bhikshu, one, of, his, early, biographers, as, kumarila, he, established, the, supremacy, of, the,

and, to, stay, in, the, sahaja, state, by, the, jnana, marga, a, number, of, ramana, maharshi, s, indian, devotees, a, more, extensive, list, of, devotees, can, be, found, in, v, ganesan, s, ramana, periya, puranam, a, list, of, western, devotees, of, ramana, maharshi, not, comprehensive, ramana, maharshi, provided, upade, a, spiritual, instruction, by, providing, darshan, and, sitting, silently, together, with, devotees, and, visitors, but, also, by, answering, the, questions, and, concerns, raised, by, those, who, sought, him, out, many, of, these, question, and, answer, sessions, have, been, transcribed, and, published, by, devotees, some, of, which, have, been, edited, by, ramana, maharshi, himself, a, few, texts, have, been, published, which, were, written, by, ramana, maharshi, himself, or, written, down, on, his, behalf, and, edited, by, him, ramana, maharshi, also, provided, an, example, by, his, own, devotion, to, shiva, which, has, been, extensively, described, by, his, devotees, such, as, walks, around, the, holy, hill, arunachala, in, which, devotees, participated, and, his, hymns, to, arunachala, ramana, maharshi, described, his, self, as, a, force, or, current, which, descended, on, him, in, his, death, experience, and, continued, throughout, his, life, a, force, or, current, a, centre, of, energy, playing, on, the, body, continuing, regardless, of, the, rigidity, or, activity, of, the, body, though, existing, in, connection, with, it, it, was, that, current, force, or, centre, that, constituted, my, self, that, kept, me, acting, and, moving, but, this, was, the, first, time, i, came, to, know, it, i, had, no, idea, at, that, time, of, the, identity, of, that, current, with, the, personal, god, or, iswara, as, i, used, to, call, him, i, was, only, feeling, that, everything, was, being, done, by, the, current, and, not, by, me, this, current, or, avesam, now, felt, as, if, it, was, my, self, not, a, superimposition, that, avesam, continues, right, up, to, now, ramana, maharshi, used, various, terms, to, denote, this, self, the, most, frequently, used, terms, were, sat, chit, ananda, which, translates, into, english, as, truth, consciousness, bliss, god, brahman, and, siva, and, the, heart, which, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, physical, heart, or, a, particular, point, in, space, but, was, rather, to, indicate, that, the, self, was, the, source, from, which, all, appearances, manifested, according, to, david, godman, the, essence, of, ramana, maharshi, s, teachings, is, that, the, self, or, real, i, is, a, non, personal, all, inclusive, awareness, the, real, self, or, real, i, is, contrary, to, perceptible, experience, not, an, experience, of, individuality, but, a, non, personal, all, inclusive, awareness, it, is, not, to, be, confused, with, the, individual, self, which, ramana, maharshi, said, was, essentially, non, existent, being, a, fabrication, of, the, mind, which, obscures, the, true, experience, of, the, real, self, he, maintained, that, the, real, self, is, always, present, and, always, experienced, but, he, emphasized, that, one, is, only, consciously, aware, of, it, as, it, really, is, when, the, self, limiting, tendencies, of, the, mind, have, ceased, permanent, and, continuous, self, awareness, is, known, as, self, realization, ramana, maharshi, considered, the, self, to, be, permanent, and, enduring, surviving, physical, death, the, sleep, dream, and, waking, states, are, mere, phenomena, appearing, on, the, self, as, is, the, i, thought, our, true, nature, is, simple, being, free, from, thoughts, ramana, maharshi, would, field, many, questions, about, jnanis, liberated, beings, from, devotees, but, even, the, terms, jnani, and, ajnani, non, liberated, being, are, incorrect, since, it, leads, one, to, the, idea, of, there, being, a, knower, and, a, known, a, subject, and, an, object, the, truth, of, it, according, to, ramana, maharshi, is, that, there, are, neither, jnanis, nor, ajnanis, there, is, simply, jnana, which, is, self, the, jnani, sees, no, one, as, an, ajnani, all, are, only, jnanis, in, his, sight, in, the, ignorant, state, one, superimposes, one, s, ignorance, on, a, jnani, and, mistakes, him, for, a, doer, in, the, state, of, jnana, the, jnani, sees, nothing, separate, from, the, self, the, self, is, all, shining, and, only, pure, jnana, ramana, maharshi, s, main, means, of, instruction, to, his, devotees, in, order, to, remove, ignorance, and, abide, in, self, awareness, was, through, silently, sitting, together, with, his, visitors, using, words, only, sparingly, his, method, of, instruction, has, been, compared, to, dakshinamurti, shiva, in, the, ascetic, appearance, of, the, guru, who, teaches, through, silence, one, evening, devotees, asked, sri, ramana, maharshi, to, explain, the, meaning, of, shankara, s, hymn, in, praise, of, dakshinamurti, they, waited, for, his, answer, but, in, vain, the, maharishi, sat, motionless, on, his, seat, in, total, silence, commenting, upon, this, silence, ramana, maharshi, said, silence, is, the, true, upadesa, it, is, the, perfect, upadesa, it, is, suited, only, for, the, most, advanced, seeker, the, others, are, unable, to, draw, full, inspiration, from, it, therefore, they, require, words, to, explain, the, truth, but, truth, is, beyond, words, it, does, not, warrant, explanation, all, that, is, possible, is, to, indicate, it, how, is, that, to, be, done, vichara, self, enquiry, also, called, tma, vich, r, or, jnana, vichara, is, the, constant, attention, to, the, inner, awareness, of, i, or, i, am, ramana, maharshi, frequently, recommended, it, as, the, most, efficient, and, direct, way, of, realizing, self, awareness, in, response, to, questions, on, self, liberation, and, the, classic, texts, on, yoga, and, vedanta, according, to, ramana, maharshi, the, i, thought, is, the, sense, of, individuality, aham, aham, i, i, is, the, self, aham, idam, i, am, this, or, i, am, that, is, the, ego, by, paying, attention, to, the, i, thought, inquiring, where, it, comes, from, the, i, thought, will, disappear, and, the, shining, forth, sphurana, of, i, i, or, self, awareness, will, appear, this, results, in, an, effortless, awareness, of, being, and, by, staying, with, it, this, i, i, gradually, destroys, the, vasanas, which, cause, the, i, thought, to, rise, when, the, vasanas, disappear, the, mind, vritti, also, comes, to, rest, since, it, centers, around, the, i, thought, and, finally, the, i, thought, never, rises, again, which, is, self, realization, or, liberation, if, one, remains, still, without, leaving, it, even, the, sphurana, having, completely, annihilated, the, sense, of, the, individuality, the, form, of, the, ego, i, am, the, body, will, itself, in, the, end, subside, just, like, the, flame, that, catches, the, camphor, this, alone, is, said, to, be, liberation, by, great, ones, and, scriptures, the, mountain, path, 1982, p, 98, robert, forman, notes, that, ramana, maharshi, made, a, distinction, between, samadhi, and, sahaja, samadhi, samadhi, is, a, contemplative, state, which, is, temporary, while, in, sahaja, samadhi, a, silent, state, is, maintained, while, engaged, in, daily, activities, ramana, maharshi, himself, stated, repeatedly, that, samadhi, only, suppresses, the, v, san, s, the, karmic, impressions, but, does, not, destroy, them, only, by, abiding, in, self, awareness, will, the, v, san, s, which, create, the, sense, of, a, separate, self, be, destroyed, and, sahaja, samadhi, be, attained, although, he, advocated, self, enquiry, as, the, fastest, means, to, realization, he, also, recommended, the, path, of, bhakti, and, self, surrender, to, one, s, deity, or, guru, either, concurrently, or, as, an, adequate, alternative, which, would, ultimately, converge, with, the, path, of, self, enquiry, surrender, has, to, be, complete, and, desireless, without, any, expectations, of, solutions, or, rewards, or, even, liberation, it, is, a, willingness, to, accept, whatever, happens, surrender, is, not, the, willful, act, of, an, individual, self, but, the, growing, awareness, that, there, is, no, individual, self, to, surrender, practice, is, aimed, at, the, removal, of, ignorance, not, at, the, attainment, of, realization, bhagavan, there, are, only, two, ways, to, conquer, destiny, or, to, be, independent, of, it, one, is, to, inquire, whose, this, destiny, is, and, discover, that, only, the, ego, is, bound, by, it, and, not, the, self, and, that, the, ego, is, non, existent, the, other, way, is, to, kill, the, ego, by, completely, surrendering, to, the, lord, realizing, one, s, helplessness, and, saying, all, the, time, not, i, but, thou, oh, lord, giving, up, all, sense, of, i, and, mine, and, leaving, it, to, the, lord, to, do, what, he, likes, with, you, surrender, can, never, be, regarded, as, complete, so, long, as, the, devotee, wants, this, or, that, from, the, lord, true, surrender, is, the, love, of, god, for, the, sake, of, love, and, nothing, else, not, even, for, the, sake, of, salvation, in, other, words, complete, effacement, of, the, ego, is, necessary, to, conquer, destiny, whether, you, achieve, this, effacement, through, self, inquiry, or, through, bhakti, marga, according, to, david, godman, ramana, maharshi, taught, that, the, idea, of, reincarnation, is, based, on, wrong, ideas, about, the, individual, self, as, being, real, ramana, maharshi, would, sometimes, say, that, rebirth, does, exist, to, step, forward, to, those, who, were, not, able, to, fully, grasp, the, non, reality, of, the, individual, self, but, when, this, illusoriness, is, realized, there, is, no, room, any, more, for, ideas, about, reincarnation, when, the, identification, with, the, body, stops, any, notions, about, death, and, rebirth, become, inapplicable, since, there, is, no, birth, or, death, within, self, a, teaching, known, as, ajativada, ramana, maharshi, reincarnation, exists, only, so, long, as, there, is, ignorance, there, is, really, no, reincarnation, at, all, either, now, or, before, nor, will, there, be, any, hereafter, this, is, the, truth, according, to, wehr, c, g, jung, noted, that, ramana, maharshi, is, not, to, be, regarded, as, an, isolated, phenomenon, but, as, a, token, of, indian, spirituality, manifest, in, many, forms, in, everyday, indian, life, according, to, zimmer, and, jung, ramana, maharshi, s, appearance, as, a, mauni, a, silent, saint, absorbed, in, samadhi, fitted, into, pre, existing, indian, notions, of, holiness, they, placed, the, indian, devotion, toward, ramana, maharshi, in, this, indian, context, according, to, alan, edwards, the, popular, image, of, ramana, maharshi, as, a, timeless, saint, also, served, the, construction, of, an, indian, identity, as, inner, oriented, and, spiritual, in, opposition, to, the, oppressive, outer, oriented, materialistic, culture, of, the, british, colonial, rulers, hindus, from, all, over, india, could, look, to, the, purely, spiritual, maharshi, as, a, symbol, that, inspired, them, to, preserve, their, distinctive, national, culture, and, identity, which, of, course, entailed, forcing, the, british, to, quit, india, though, ramana, maharshi, s, answers, explain, and, incorporate, elements, from, advaita, vedanta, his, spiritual, life, is, strongly, associated, with, shaivism, the, tamil, compendium, of, devotional, songs, known, as, tirumurai, along, with, the, vedas, the, shaiva, agamas, and, meykanda, or, siddhanta, shastras, form, the, scriptural, canon, of, tamil, shaiva, siddhanta, as, a, youth, prior, to, his, awakening, ramana, maharshi, read, the, periya, puranam, the, stories, of, the, 63, tamil, saints, in, later, life, he, told, those, stories, to, his, devotees, when, telling, these, stories, he, used, to, dramatize, the, characters, of, the, main, figures, in, voice, and, gesture, and, seemed, to, identify, himself, fully, with, them, ramana, maharshi, himself, considered, god, guru, and, self, to, be, the, manifestations, of, the, same, reality, ramana, maharshi, considered, the, self, to, be, his, guru, in, the, form, of, the, sacred, mountain, arunachala, which, is, considered, to, be, the, manifestation, of, shiva, arunachala, is, one, of, the, five, main, shaivite, holy, places, in, south, india, which, can, be, worshipped, through, the, mantra, om, arunachala, shivaya, namah, and, by, pradakshina, walking, around, the, mountain, a, practice, which, was, often, performed, by, ramana, maharshi, asked, about, the, special, sanctity, of, arunachala, ramana, maharshi, said, that, arunachala, is, shiva, himself, in, his, later, years, ramana, maharshi, said, it, was, the, spiritual, power, of, arunachala, which, had, brought, about, his, self, realisation, he, composed, the, five, hymns, to, arunachala, as, devotional, song, on, the, three, occasions, venkataraman, ramana, referred, to, himself, he, used, the, name, arunachala, ramana, ramana, maharshi, also, used, to, smear, his, forehead, with, holy, ash, as, a, token, of, veneration, in, later, life, ramana, maharshi, himself, came, to, be, regarded, as, dakshinamurthy, an, aspect, of, shiva, as, a, guru, of, all, types, of, knowledge, and, bestower, of, jnana, this, aspect, of, shiva, is, his, personification, as, the, supreme, or, the, ultimate, awareness, understanding, and, knowledge, this, form, represents, shiva, in, his, aspect, as, a, teacher, of, yoga, music, and, wisdom, and, giving, exposition, on, the, shastras, during, his, lifetime, through, contact, with, educated, devotees, like, ganapata, muni, ramana, maharshi, became, acquainted, with, works, on, shaivism, and, advaita, vedanta, and, used, them, to, explain, his, insights, people, wonder, how, i, speak, of, bhagavad, gita, etc, it, is, due, to, hearsay, i, have, not, read, the, gita, nor, waded, through, commentaries, for, its, meaning, when, i, hear, a, sloka, verse, i, think, its, meaning, is, clear, and, i, say, it, that, is, all, and, nothing, more, already, in, 1896, a, few, months, after, his, arrival, at, arunachala, ramana, maharshi, attracted, his, first, disciple, uddandi, nayinar, who, recognised, in, him, the, living, embodiment, of, the, holy, scriptures, uddandi, was, well, versed, in, classic, texts, on, yoga, and, vedanta, and, recited, texts, as, the, yoga, vasistha, and, kaivalya, navaneeta, in, ramana, maharshi, s, presence, in, 1897, ramana, maharshi, was, joined, by, palaniswami, who, became, his, attendant, palaniswami, studied, books, in, tamil, on, vedanta, such, as, kaivalya, navaneeta, shankara, s, vivekachudamani, and, yoga, vasistha, he, had, difficulties, understanding, tamil, ramana, maharshi, read, the, books, too, and, explained, them, to, palaniswami, as, early, as, 1900, when, ramana, maharshi, was, 20, years, old, he, became, acquainted, with, the, teachings, of, the, hindu, monk, and, neo, vedanta, teacher, swami, vivekananda, through, gambhiram, seshayya, seshayya, was, interested, in, yoga, techniques, and, used, to, bring, his, books, and, explain, his, difficulties, ramana, maharshi, answered, on, small, scraps, of, paper, which, were, collected, after, his, death, in, the, late, 1920s, in, a, booklet, called, vichara, sangraham, self, enquiry, one, of, the, works, that, ramana, maharshi, used, to, explain, his, insights, was, the, ribhu, gita, a, song, at, the, heart, of, the, shivarahasya, purana, one, of, the, shaiva, upapuranas, or, ancillary, purana, regarding, shiva, and, shaivite, worship, another, work, used, by, him, was, the, dakshinamurti, stotram, a, text, by, shankara, it, is, a, hymn, to, shiva, explaining, advaita, vedanta, ramana, maharshi, gave, his, approval, to, a, variety, of, paths, and, practices, from, various, religions, with, his, own, upadesa, instruction, or, guidance, given, to, a, disciple, by, his, guru, always, pointing, to, the, true, self, of, the, devotees, in, contrast, to, classical, advaita, vedanta, ramana, maharshi, emphasized, the, personal, experience, of, self, realization, instead, of, philosophical, argumentation, and, the, study, of, scripture, ramana, maharshi, s, authority, was, based, on, his, personal, experience, from, which, he, explained, classic, texts, on, yoga, and, vedanta, which, he, came, acquainted, with, via, his, devotees, arvind, sharma, qualifies, ramana, maharshi, as, the, chief, exponent, of, experiential, advaita, to, distinguish, his, approach, from, shankara, s, classical, doctrinal, advaita, fort, classifies, him, as, a, neo, vedantin, because, of, the, focus, on, self, inquiry, instead, of, philosophical, speculation, ramana, maharshi, himself, did, not, call, his, insights, advaita, but, said, that, dvaita, and, advaita, are, relative, terms, based, on, a, sense, of, duality, while, the, self, or, being, is, all, there, is, although, ramana, maharshi, s, teaching, is, consistent, with, and, generally, associated, with, hinduism, the, upanishads, and, advaita, vedanta, there, are, differences, with, the, traditional, advaitic, school, advaita, recommends, a, negationist, neti, neti, sanskrit, not, this, not, this, path, or, mental, affirmations, that, the, self, is, the, only, reality, such, as, i, am, brahman, or, i, am, he, while, ramana, maharshi, advocated, self, enquiry, nan, yar, in, contrast, with, traditional, advaita, vedanta, ramana, maharshi, strongly, discouraged, devotees, from, adopting, a, renunciate, lifestyle, and, renouncing, their, responsibilities, to, one, devotee, who, felt, he, should, abandon, his, family, whom, he, described, as, samsara, illusion, to, intensify, his, spiritual, practice, sri, ramana, maharshi, replied, oh, is, that, so, what, really, is, meant, by, samsara, is, it, within, or, without, wife, children, and, others, is, that, all, the, samsara, what, have, they, done, please, find, out, first, what, really, is, meant, by, samsara, afterwards, we, shall, consider, the, question, of, abandoning, them, the, scholar, of, religion, lola, williamson, has, described, indian, gurus, such, as, ramana, maharshi, meher, baba, sri, aurobindo, and, swami, satchidananda, saraswati, as, having, developed, hindu, inspired, meditation, movements, also, called, neo, vedanta, and, modernist, hinduism, although, many, claim, to, be, influenced, by, him, ramana, maharshi, did, not, publicise, himself, as, a, guru, never, claimed, to, have, disciples, and, never, appointed, any, successors, while, a, few, who, came, to, see, him, are, said, to, have, become, enlightened, through, association, he, did, not, publicly, acknowledge, any, living, person, as, liberated, other, than, his, mother, at, death, ramana, maharshi, never, promoted, any, lineage, with, regard, to, the, sri, ramana, ashram, in, 1938, maharshi, made, a, legal, will, bequeathing, all, the, ramanashram, properties, to, his, younger, brother, niranjanananda, and, his, descendants, in, 2013, ramanashram, is, run, by, sri, niranjananda, s, grandson, sri, v, s, raman, ramanashram, is, legally, recognised, as, a, public, religious, trust, whose, aim, is, to, maintain, it, in, a, way, that, is, consistent, with, sri, ramana, maharshi, s, declared, wishes, the, ashram, should, remain, open, as, a, spiritual, institution, so, that, anyone, who, wishes, to, can, avail, themselves, of, its, facilities, in, the, 1930s, maharshi, s, teachings, were, brought, to, the, west, by, paul, brunton, in, his, a, search, in, secret, india, stimulated, by, arthur, osborne, in, the, 1960s, bhagawat, singh, actively, started, to, spread, ramana, maharshi, s, teachings, in, the, us, ramana, maharshi, has, been, further, popularized, in, the, west, by, the, neo, advaita, movement, via, the, students, of, h, w, l, poonja, this, movement, gives, a, western, re, interpretation, of, his, teachings, by, placing, sole, emphasis, on, insight, alone, it, has, been, criticized, for, this, emphasis, omitting, the, preparatory, practices, nevertheless, neo, advaita, has, become, an, important, constituent, of, popular, western, spirituality, the, scholar, philip, goldberg, has, listed, western, religious, thinkers, influenced, by, ramana, maharshi, as, including, francis, x, clooney, georg, feuerstein, bede, griffiths, andrew, harvey, thomas, merton, henri, le, saux, swami, abhishiktananada, eckhart, tolle, and, ken, wilber, according, to, ebert, ramana, maharshi, never, felt, moved, to, formulate, his, teaching, of, his, own, accord, either, verbally, or, in, writing, the, few, writings, he, is, credited, with, came, into, being, as, answers, to, questions, asked, by, his, disciples, or, through, their, urging, only, a, few, hymns, were, written, on, his, own, initiative, writings, by, ramana, maharshi, are, all, these, texts, are, collected, in, the, collected, works, in, addition, to, original, works, ramana, maharshi, has, also, translated, some, scriptures, for, the, benefit, of, devotees, he, selected, rearranged, and, translated, 42, verses, from, the, bhagavad, gita, into, tamil, and, malayalam, he, has, also, translated, few, works, such, as, dakshinamurti, stotra, vivekachudamani, and, d, g, d,
