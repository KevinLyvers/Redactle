herder, alexander, von, humboldt, wilhelm, von, humboldt, and, august, and, friedrich, schlegel, have, come, to, be, collectively, termed, weimar, classicism, due, to, their, very, close, relationship, many, modern, historians, assume, that, goethe, and, schiller, had, a, romantic, and, sexual, affair, the, german, philosopher, arthur, schopenhauer, named, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship, one, of, the, four, greatest, novels, ever, written, while, the, american, philosopher, and, essayist, ralph, waldo, emerson, selected, goethe, as, one, of, six, representative, men, in, his, work, of, the, same, name, along, with, plato, emanuel, swedenborg, montaigne, napoleon, and, shakespeare, goethe, s, comments, and, observations, form, the, basis, of, several, biographical,

turkish, ancestry, bernt, engelmann, has, said, that, the, german, poet, prince, with, oriental, ancestors, is, by, no, means, a, rare, exception, nicolae, iorga, believes, that, the, soldan, family, were, originally, hungarian, nobles, who, settled, in, moldavia, from, transylvania, together, with, the, first, prince, of, independent, moldavia, bogdan, i, and, then, romanised, their, name, historians, radu, rosetti, and, gheorghe, ghib, nescu, also, argue, that, in, the, charter, from, 1411, the, family, name, is, written, before, the, first, name, this, being, a, custom, only, in, hungarian, documents, moreover, the, first, name, of, peter, s, brother, miclaus, could, come, from, the, hungarian, form, of, nicholas, which, is, mikl, s, rosetti, is, thus, convinced, that, the, soldans, were, hungarians, from, the, maramure, region, however, noble, families, with, the, name, soldan, can, also, be, found, in, prussia, and, sweden, so, a, possible, german, origin, of, the, family, should, not, be, excluded, the, family, might, have, first, become, hungarian, in, maramure, and, then, romanian, in, moldavia, goethe, s, grandfather, friedrich, georg, goethe, 1657, 1730,

fencing, johann, caspar, feeling, frustrated, in, his, own, ambitions, was, determined, that, his, children, should, have, every, advantage, he, had, missed, although, goethe, s, great, passion, was, drawing, he, quickly, became, interested, in, literature, friedrich, gottlieb, klopstock, 1724, 1803, and, homer, were, among, his, early, favorites, he, also, had, a, devotion, to, the, theater, and, was, greatly, fascinated, by, the, puppet, shows, that, were, annually, arranged, by, occupying, french, soldiers, at, his, home, and, which, later, became, a, recurrent, theme, in, his, literary, work, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship, he, also, took, great, pleasure, in, reading, works, on, history, and, religion, of, this, period, he, wrote, i, had, from, childhood, the, singular, habit, of, always, learning, by, heart, the, beginnings, of, books, and, the, divisions, of, a, work, first, of, the, five, books, of, moses, and, then, of, the, aeneid, and, ovid, s, metamorphoses, if, an, ever, active, imagination, of, which, that, tale, may, bear, witness, led, me, hither, and, thither, if, the, medley, of, fable, and, history, mythology, and, religion, threatened, to, bewilder, me, i, readily, fled, to, those, oriental, regions, and, plunged, into, the, first, books, of, moses, and, there, amid, the, scattered, shepherd, tribes, found, myself, at, once, in, the, greatest, solitude, and, the, greatest, society, goethe, also, became, acquainted, with, frankfurt, actors, valerian, tornius, wrote, goethe, leben, wirken, und, schaffen, in, early, literary, attempts, goethe, showed, an, infatuation, with, gretchen, who, would, later, reappear, in, his, faust, and, the, adventures, with, whom, he, would, describe, concisely, in, dichtung, und, wahrheit, he, adored, caritas, meixner, 1750, 1773, a, wealthy, worms, merchant, s, daughter, and, friend, of, his, sister, who, would, later, marry, the, merchant, g, f, schuler, goethe, studied, law, at, leipzig, university, from, 1765, to, 1768, he, detested, learning, age, old, judicial, rules, by, heart, preferring, instead, to, attend, the, lessons, of, the, university, professor, and, poet, christian, f, rchtegott, gellert, in, leipzig, goethe, fell, in, love, with, anna, katharina, sch, nkopf, the, daughter, of, a, craftsman, and, innkeeper, writing, cheerful, verses, about, her, in, the, rococo, genre, in, 1770, he, released, anonymously, his, first, collection, of, poems, annette, his, uncritical, admiration, for, many, contemporary, poets, evaporated, as, he, developed, an, interest, in, gotthold, ephraim, lessing, and, christoph, martin, wieland, by, this, time, goethe, had, already, written, a, great, deal, but, he, discarded, nearly, all, of, these, works, except, for, the, comedy, die, mitschuldigen, the, inn, auerbachs, keller, and, its, legend, of, johann, georg, faust, s, 1525, barrel, ride, impressed, him, so, much, that, auerbachs, keller, became, the, only, real, place, in, his, closet, drama, faust, part, one, given, that, he, was, making, little, progress, in, his, formal, studies, goethe, was, forced, to, return, to, frankfurt, at, the, end, of, august, 1768, back, in, frankfurt, goethe, became, severely, ill, during, the, year, and, a, half, that, followed, marked, by, several, relapses, relations, with, his, father, worsened, during, convalescence, goethe, was, nursed, by, his, mother, and, sister, in, april, 1770, goethe, left, frankfurt, in, order, to, finish, his, studies, this, time, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, in, alsace, goethe, blossomed, no, other, landscape, was, to, be, described, by, him, as, affectionately, as, the, warm, wide, rhineland, in, strasbourg, goethe, met, johann, gottfried, herder, the, two, became, close, friends, and, crucially, to, goethe, s, intellectual, development, herder, kindled, his, interest, in, william, shakespeare, ossian, and, in, the, notion, of, volkspoesie, folk, poetry, on, 14, october, 1772, goethe, hosted, a, gathering, in, his, parents, home, in, honour, of, the, first, german, shakespeare, day, his, first, acquaintance, with, shakespeare, s, works, is, described, as, his, personal, awakening, in, the, field, of, literature, on, a, trip, to, the, village, of, sessenheim, in, october, 1770, goethe, fell, in, love, with, friederike, brion, but, the, tryst, ended, in, august, 1771, several, of, goethe, s, poems, like, willkommen, und, abschied, sesenheimer, lieder, and, heidenr, slein, date, to, this, period, at, the, end, of, august, 1771, goethe, acquired, the, academic, degree, of, the, licentiate, in, law, from, strasbourg, and, was, able, to, establish, a, small, legal, practice, in, frankfurt, although, in, his, academic, work, he, had, given, voice, to, an, ambition, to, make, jurisprudence, progressively, more, humane, his, inexperience, led, him, to, proceed, too, vigorously, in, his, first, cases, for, which, he, was, reprimanded, and, lost, further, clientele, within, a, few, months, this, put, an, early, end, to, his, law, career, around, this, time, goethe, became, acquainted, with, the, court, of, darmstadt, where, his, inventiveness, was, praised, it, was, from, that, world, that, there, came, johann, georg, schlosser, who, later, became, goethe, s, brother, in, law, and, johann, heinrich, merck, goethe, also, pursued, literary, plans, again, this, time, his, father, did, not, object, and, even, helped, goethe, obtained, a, copy, of, the, biography, of, a, noble, highwayman, from, the, german, peasants, war, in, a, couple, of, weeks, the, biography, was, reworked, into, a, colourful, drama, titled, g, tz, von, berlichingen, and, the, work, struck, a, chord, among, goethe, s, contemporaries, since, goethe, could, not, subsist, on, his, income, as, one, of, the, editors, of, a, literary, periodical, published, by, schlosser, and, merck, in, may, 1772, he, once, more, took, up, the, practice, of, law, this, time, at, wetzlar, in, 1774, he, wrote, the, book, which, would, bring, him, worldwide, fame, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, the, broad, shape, of, the, work, s, plot, is, largely, based, on, what, goethe, experienced, during, his, time, at, wetzlar, with, charlotte, buff, 1753, 1828, and, her, fianc, johann, christian, kestner, 1741, 1800, as, well, as, the, suicide, of, the, goethes, friend, karl, wilhelm, jerusalem, 1747, 1772, in, the, latter, case, goethe, made, a, desperate, passion, of, what, was, in, reality, a, hearty, and, relaxed, friendship, despite, the, immense, success, of, werther, it, did, not, bring, goethe, much, financial, gain, since, the, protection, later, afforded, by, copyright, laws, at, that, time, virtually, did, not, exist, in, later, years, goethe, would, counter, this, problem, by, periodically, authorizing, new, revised, editions, of, his, complete, works, in, 1775, on, the, strength, of, his, fame, as, the, author, of, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, goethe, was, invited, to, the, court, of, karl, august, duke, of, saxe, weimar, eisenach, who, would, become, grand, duke, in, 1815, the, duke, s, mother, duchess, anna, amalia, had, been, the, long, time, regent, on, behalf, of, her, son, until, 1775, and, was, one, of, the, most, important, patrons, of, the, arts, in, her, day, making, her, court, into, a, centre, of, the, arts, her, court, had, hosted, the, renowned, theatre, company, of, abel, seyler, until, a, 1774, fire, had, destroyed, schloss, weimar, karl, august, came, of, age, when, he, turned, eighteen, in, 1775, although, his, mother, continued, to, be, a, major, presence, at, the, court, so, it, was, that, goethe, took, up, residence, in, weimar, where, he, remained, for, the, rest, of, his, life, and, where, over, the, course, of, many, years, he, held, a, succession, of, offices, including, superintendent, of, the, ducal, library, he, was, moreover, the, duke, s, friend, and, chief, adviser, in, 1776, goethe, formed, a, close, relationship, with, charlotte, von, stein, an, older, married, woman, the, intimate, bond, with, her, lasted, for, ten, years, after, which, goethe, abruptly, left, for, italy, without, giving, his, companion, any, notice, she, was, emotionally, distraught, at, the, time, but, they, were, eventually, reconciled, aside, from, his, official, duties, goethe, was, also, a, friend, and, confidant, to, duke, karl, august, and, participated, in, the, activities, of, the, court, for, goethe, his, first, ten, years, at, weimar, could, well, be, described, as, a, garnering, of, a, degree, and, range, of, experiences, which, perhaps, could, have, been, achieved, in, no, other, way, in, 1779, goethe, took, on, the, war, commission, of, the, grand, duchy, of, saxe, weimar, in, addition, to, the, mines, and, highways, commissions, in, 1782, when, the, duchy, s, chancellor, of, the, exchequer, left, his, office, goethe, agreed, to, act, in, his, place, and, did, so, for, two, and, a, half, years, this, post, virtually, made, him, prime, minister, and, the, principal, representative, of, the, duchy, goethe, was, ennobled, in, 1782, this, being, indicated, by, the, von, in, his, name, in, that, same, year, goethe, moved, into, what, would, be, his, primary, residence, in, weimar, for, the, next, 50, years, as, head, of, the, saxe, weimar, war, commission, goethe, participated, in, the, recruitment, of, mercenaries, into, the, prussian, and, british, military, during, the, american, revolution, the, author, daniel, wilson, claims, that, goethe, engaged, in, negotiating, the, forced, sale, of, vagabonds, criminals, and, political, dissidents, as, part, of, these, activities, goethe, s, journey, to, the, italian, peninsula, and, sicily, from, 1786, to, 1788, was, of, great, significance, in, his, aesthetic, and, philosophical, development, his, father, had, made, a, similar, journey, and, his, example, was, a, major, motivating, factor, for, goethe, to, make, the, trip, more, importantly, however, the, work, of, johann, joachim, winckelmann, had, provoked, a, general, renewed, interest, in, the, classical, art, of, ancient, greece, and, rome, thus, goethe, s, journey, had, something, of, the, nature, of, a, pilgrimage, to, it, during, the, course, of, his, trip, goethe, met, and, befriended, the, artists, angelica, kauffman, and, johann, heinrich, wilhelm, tischbein, as, well, as, encountering, such, notable, characters, as, lady, hamilton, and, alessandro, cagliostro, he, also, journeyed, to, sicily, during, this, time, and, wrote, that, to, have, seen, italy, without, having, seen, sicily, is, to, not, have, seen, italy, at, all, for, sicily, is, the, clue, to, everything, while, in, southern, italy, and, sicily, goethe, encountered, for, the, first, time, genuine, greek, as, opposed, to, roman, architecture, and, was, quite, startled, by, its, relative, simplicity, winckelmann, had, not, recognized, the, distinctness, of, the, two, styles, goethe, s, diaries, of, this, period, form, the, basis, of, the, non, fiction, italian, journey, italian, journey, only, covers, the, first, year, of, goethe, s, visit, the, remaining, year, is, largely, undocumented, aside, from, the, fact, that, he, spent, much, of, it, in, venice, this, gap, in, the, record, has, been, the, source, of, much, speculation, over, the, years, in, the, decades, which, immediately, followed, its, publication, in, 1816, italian, journey, inspired, countless, german, youths, to, follow, goethe, s, example, this, is, pictured, somewhat, satirically, in, george, eliot, s, middlemarch, in, late, 1792, goethe, took, part, in, the, battle, of, valmy, against, revolutionary, france, assisting, duke, karl, august, of, saxe, weimar, eisenach, during, the, failed, invasion, of, france, again, during, the, siege, of, mainz, he, assisted, karl, august, as, a, military, observer, his, written, account, of, these, events, can, be, found, within, his, complete, works, in, 1794, friedrich, schiller, wrote, to, goethe, offering, friendship, they, had, previously, had, only, a, mutually, wary, relationship, ever, since, first, becoming, acquainted, in, 1788, this, collaborative, friendship, lasted, until, schiller, s, death, in, 1805, in, 1806, goethe, was, living, in, weimar, with, his, mistress, christiane, vulpius, the, sister, of, christian, a, vulpius, and, daughter, of, archivist, johann, friedrich, vulpius, 1725, 1786, and, their, son, august, von, goethe, on, 13, october, napoleon, s, army, invaded, the, town, the, french, spoon, guards, the, least, disciplined, soldiers, occupied, goethe, s, house, the, spoon, guards, had, broken, in, they, had, drunk, wine, made, a, great, uproar, and, called, for, the, master, of, the, house, goethe, s, secretary, riemer, reports, although, already, undressed, and, wearing, only, his, wide, nightgown, he, descended, the, stairs, towards, them, and, inquired, what, they, wanted, from, him, his, dignified, figure, commanding, respect, and, his, spiritual, mien, seemed, to, impress, even, them, but, it, was, not, to, last, long, late, at, night, they, burst, into, his, bedroom, with, drawn, bayonets, goethe, was, petrified, christiane, raised, a, lot, of, noise, and, even, tangled, with, them, other, people, who, had, taken, refuge, in, goethe, s, house, rushed, in, and, so, the, marauders, eventually, withdrew, again, it, was, christiane, who, commanded, and, organized, the, defense, of, the, house, on, the, frauenplan, the, barricading, of, the, kitchen, and, the, cellar, against, the, wild, pillaging, soldiery, was, her, work, goethe, noted, in, his, diary, fires, rapine, a, frightful, night, preservation, of, the, house, through, steadfastness, and, luck, the, luck, was, goethe, s, the, steadfastness, was, displayed, by, christiane, days, afterward, on, 19, october, 1806, goethe, legitimized, their, 18, year, relationship, by, marrying, christiane, in, a, quiet, marriage, service, at, the, jakobskirche, in, weimar, they, had, already, had, several, children, together, by, this, time, including, their, son, julius, august, walter, von, goethe, 1789, 1830, whose, wife, ottilie, von, pogwisch, 1796, 1872, cared, for, the, elder, goethe, until, his, death, in, 1832, august, and, ottilie, had, three, children, walther, freiherr, von, goethe, 1818, 1885, wolfgang, freiherr, von, goethe, 1820, 1883, and, alma, von, goethe, 1827, 1844, christiane, von, goethe, died, in, 1816, johann, reflected, there, is, nothing, more, charming, to, see, than, a, mother, with, her, child, in, her, arms, and, there, is, nothing, more, venerable, than, a, mother, among, a, number, of, her, children, after, 1793, goethe, devoted, his, endeavours, primarily, to, literature, in, 1812, he, travelled, to, teplice, and, vienna, both, times, meeting, his, admirer, ludwig, van, beethoven, who, had, set, music, to, egmont, two, years, prior, in, 1810, by, 1820, goethe, was, on, amiable, terms, with, kaspar, maria, von, sternberg, in, 1821, having, recovered, from, a, near, fatal, heart, illness, the, 72, year, old, goethe, fell, in, love, with, ulrike, von, levetzow, 17, at, the, time, in, 1823, he, wanted, to, marry, her, but, because, of, the, opposition, of, her, mother, he, never, proposed, their, last, meeting, in, carlsbad, on, 5, september, 1823, inspired, his, poem, marienbad, elegy, which, he, considered, one, of, his, finest, works, during, that, time, he, also, developed, a, deep, emotional, bond, with, the, polish, pianist, maria, szymanowska, 33, at, the, time, and, she, separated, from, her, husband, in, 1821, goethe, s, friend, carl, friedrich, zelter, introduced, him, to, the, 12, year, old, felix, mendelssohn, goethe, now, in, his, seventies, was, greatly, impressed, by, the, child, leading, to, perhaps, the, earliest, confirmed, comparison, with, mozart, in, the, following, conversation, between, goethe, and, zelter, musical, prodigies, are, probably, no, longer, so, rare, but, what, this, little, man, can, do, in, extemporizing, and, playing, at, sight, borders, the, miraculous, and, i, could, not, have, believed, it, possible, at, so, early, an, age, and, yet, you, heard, mozart, in, his, seventh, year, at, frankfurt, said, zelter, yes, answered, goethe, but, what, your, pupil, already, accomplishes, bears, the, same, relation, to, the, mozart, of, that, time, that, the, cultivated, talk, of, a, grown, up, person, bears, to, the, prattle, of, a, child, mendelssohn, was, invited, to, meet, goethe, on, several, later, occasions, and, set, a, number, of, goethe, s, poems, to, music, his, other, compositions, inspired, by, goethe, include, the, overture, calm, sea, and, prosperous, voyage, op, 27, 1828, and, the, cantata, die, erste, walpurgisnacht, the, first, walpurgis, night, op, 60, 1832, heinrich, heine, on, his, hiking, tour, through, germany, the, trip, immortalised, in, his, work, die, harzreise, was, granted, an, audience, with, goethe, in, 1824, in, weimar, heine, had, been, a, great, admirer, of, goethe, s, in, his,

earliest, known, account, was, of, karl, wilhelm, m, ller, s, which, gives, all, of, his, last, words, macht, doch, den, zweiten, fensterladen, in, der, stube, auch, auf, damit, mehr, licht,

is, disputed, as, vogel, was, not, in, the, room, at, the, moment, goethe, died, something, he, himself, says, in, his, account, more, light, is, said, to, have, been, the, last, words, of, the, man, who, always, hated, darkness, in, every, respect, as, i, had, left, the, dying, room, for, a, moment, thomas, carlyle, in, his, letter, to, john, carlyle, 2, july, 1832, records, that, he, had,

became, known, in, europe, after, being, translated, from, english, to, german, the, short, epistolary, novel, die, leiden, des, jungen, werthers, or, the, sorrows, of, young, werther, published, in, 1774, recounts, an, unhappy, romantic, infatuation, that, ends, in, suicide, goethe, admitted, that, he, shot, his, hero, to, save, himself, a, reference, to, goethe, s, near, suicidal, obsession,

into, reality, and, the, poem, imitated, he, was, against, this, reading, of, poetry, epistolary, novels, were, common, during, this, time, letter, writing, being, a, primary, mode, of, communication, what, set, goethe, s, book, apart, from, other, such, novels, was, its, expression, of, unbridled, longing, for, a, joy, beyond, possibility, its, sense, of, defiant, rebellion, against, authority, and, of, principal, importance, its, total, subjectivity, qualities, that, trailblazed, the, romantic, movement, the, next, work, his, epic, closet, drama, faust, was, completed, in, stages, the, first, part, was, published, in, 1808, and, created, a, sensation, goethe, finished, faust, part, two, in, the, year, of, his, death, and, the, work, was, published, posthumously, goethe, s, original, draft, of, a, faust, play, which, probably, dates, from, 1773, to, 1774, and, is, now, known, as, the, urfaust, was, also, published, after, his, death, the, first, operatic, version, of, goethe, s, faust, by, louis, spohr, appeared, in, 1814, the, work, subsequently, inspired, operas, and, oratorios, by, schumann, berlioz, gounod, boito, busoni, and, schnittke, as, well, as, symphonic, works, by, liszt, wagner, and, mahler, faust, became, the, ur, myth, of, many, figures, in, the, 19th, century, later, a, facet, of, its, plot, i, e, of, selling, one, s, soul, to, the, devil, for, power, over, the, physical, world, took, on, increasing, literary, importance, and, became, a, view, of, the, victory, of, technology, and, of, industrialism, along, with, its, dubious, human, expenses, in, 1919, the, world, premiere, complete, production, of, faust, was, staged, at, the, goetheanum, goethe, s, poetic, work, served, as, a, model, for, an, entire, movement, in, german, poetry, termed, innerlichkeit, introversion, and, represented, by, for, example, heine, goethe, s, words, inspired, a, number, of, compositions, by, among, others, mozart, beethoven, who, idolised, goethe, schubert, berlioz, and, wolf, perhaps, the, single, most, influential, piece, is, mignon, s, song, which, opens, with, one, of, the, most, famous, lines, in, german, poetry, an, allusion, to, italy, kennst, du, das, land, wo, die, zitronen, bl, hn, do, you, know, the, land, where, the, lemon, trees, bloom, he, is, also, widely, quoted, epigrams, such, as, against, criticism, a, man, can, neither, protest, nor, defend, himself, he, must, act, in, spite, of, it, and, then, it, will, gradually, yield, to, him, divide, and, rule, a, sound, motto, unite, and, lead, a, better, one, and, enjoy, when, you, can, and, endure, when, you, must, are, still, in, usage, or, are, often, paraphrased, lines, from, faust, such, as, das, also, war, des, pudels, kern, das, ist, der, weisheit, letzter, schluss, or, grau, ist, alle, theorie, have, entered, everyday, german, usage, some, well, known, quotations, are, often, incorrectly, attributed, to, goethe, these, include, hippocrates, art, is, long, life, is, short, which, is, echoed, in, goethe, s, faust, and, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship, as, to, what, i, have, done, as, a, poet, i, take, no, pride, in, it, but, that, in, my, century, i, am, the, only, person, who, knows, the, truth, in, the, difficult, science, of, colours, of, that, i, say, i, am, not, a, little, proud, and, here, i, have, a, consciousness, of, a, superiority, to, many, although, his, literary, work, has, attracted, the, most, interest, goethe, was, also, keenly, involved, in, studies, of, natural, science, he, wrote, several, works, on, morphology, and, colour, theory, in, the, 1790s, he, undertook, galvanic, experiments, and, studied, anatomical, issues, together, with, alexander, von, humboldt, he, also, had, the, largest, private, collection, of, minerals, in, all, of, europe, by, the, time, of, his, death, in, order, to, gain, a, comprehensive, view, in, geology, he, had, collected, 17, 800, rock, samples, his, focus, on, morphology, and, what, was, later, called, homology, influenced, 19th, century, naturalists, although, his, ideas, of, transformation, were, about, the, continuous, metamorphosis, of, living, things, and, did, not, relate, to, contemporary, ideas, of, transformisme, or, transmutation, of, species, homology, or, as, tienne, geoffroy, saint, hilaire, called, it, analogie, was, used, by, charles, darwin, as, strong, evidence, of, common, descent, and, of, laws, of, variation, goethe, s, studies, notably, with, an, elephant, s, skull, lent, to, him, by, samuel, thomas, von, soemmerring, led, him, to, independently, discover, the, human, intermaxillary, bone, also, known, as, goethe, s, bone, in, 1784, which, broussonet, 1779, and, vicq, d, azyr, 1780, had, using, different, methods, identified, several, years, earlier, while, not, the, only, one, in, his, time, to, question, the, prevailing, view, that, this, bone, did, not, exist, in, humans, goethe, who, believed, ancient, anatomists, had, known, about, this, bone, was, the, first, to, prove, its, existence, in, all, mammals, the, elephant, s, skull, that, led, goethe, to, this, discovery, and, was, subsequently, named, the, goethean, elephant, still, exists, and, is, displayed, in, the, ottoneum, in, kassel, germany, during, his, italian, journey, goethe, formulated, a, theory, of, plant, metamorphosis, in, which, the, archetypal, form, of, the, plant, is, to, be, found, in, the, leaf, he, writes, from, top, to, bottom, a, plant, is, all, leaf, united, so, inseparably, with, the, future, bud, that, one, cannot, be, imagined, without, the, other, in, 1790, he, published, his, metamorphosis, of, plants, as, one, of, the, many, precursors, in, the, history, of, evolutionary, thought, goethe, wrote, in, story, of, my, botanical, studies, 1831, the, ever, changing, display, of, plant, forms, which, i, have, followed, for, so, many, years, awakens, increasingly, within, me, the, notion, the, plant, forms, which, surround, us, were, not, all, created, at, some, given, point, in, time, and, then, locked, into, the, given, form, they, have, been, given, a, felicitous, mobility, and, plasticity, that, allows, them, to, grow, and, adapt, themselves, to, many, different, conditions, in, many, different, places, goethe, s, botanical, theories, were, partly, based, on, his, gardening, in, weimar, goethe, also, popularized, the, goethe, barometer, using, a, principle, established, by, torricelli, according, to, hegel, goethe, has, occupied, himself, a, good, deal, with, meteorology, barometer, readings, interested, him, particularly, what, he, says, is, important, the, main, thing, is, that, he, gives, a, comparative, table, of, barometric, readings, during, the, whole, month, of, december, 1822, at, weimar, jena, london, boston, vienna, t, pel, he, claims, to, deduce, from, it, that, the, barometric, level, varies, in, the, same, proportion, not, only, in, each, zone, but, that, it, has, the, same, variation, too, at, different, altitudes, above, sea, level, in, 1810, goethe, published, his, theory, of, colours, which, he, considered, his, most, important, work, in, it, he, contentiously, characterized, colour, as, arising, from, the, dynamic, interplay, of, light, and, darkness, through, the, mediation, of, a, turbid, medium, in, 1816, schopenhauer, went, on, to, develop, his, own, theory, in, on, vision, and, colours, based, on, the, observations, supplied, in, goethe, s, book, after, being, translated, into, english, by, charles, eastlake, in, 1840, his, theory, became, widely, adopted, by, the, art, world, most, notably, j, m, w, turner, goethe, s, work, also, inspired, the, philosopher, ludwig, wittgenstein, to, write, his, remarks, on, colour, goethe, was, vehemently, opposed, to, newton, s, analytic, treatment, of, colour, engaging, instead, in, compiling, a, comprehensive, rational, description, of, a, wide, variety, of, colour, phenomena, although, the, accuracy, of, goethe, s, observations, does, not, admit, a, great, deal, of, criticism, his, aesthetic, approach, did, not, lend, itself, to, the, demands, of, analytic, and, mathematical, analysis, used, ubiquitously, in, modern, science, goethe, was, however, the, first, to, systematically, study, the, physiological, effects, of, colour, and, his, observations, on, the, effect, of, opposed, colours, led, him, to, a, symmetric, arrangement, of, his, colour, wheel, for, the, colours, diametrically, opposed, to, each, other, are, those, which, reciprocally, evoke, each, other, in, the, eye, in, this, he, anticipated, ewald, hering, s, opponent, colour, theory, 1872, goethe, outlines, his, method, in, the, essay, the, experiment, as, mediator, between, subject, and, object, 1772, in, the, kurschner, edition, of, goethe, s, works, the, science, editor, rudolf, steiner, presents, goethe, s, approach, to, science, as, phenomenological, steiner, elaborated, on, that, in, the, books, the, theory, of, knowledge, implicit, in, goethe, s, world, conception, and, goethe, s, world, view, in, which, he, characterizes, intuition, as, the, instrument, by, which, one, grasps, goethe, s, biological, archetype, the, typus, novalis, himself, a, geologist, and, mining, engineer, expressed, the, opinion, that, goethe, was, the, first, physicist, of, his, time, and, epoch, making, in, the, history, of, physics, writing, that, goethe, s, studies, of, light, of, the, metamorphosis, of, plants, and, of, insects, were, indications, and, proofs, that, the, perfect, educational, lecture, belongs, in, the, artist, s, sphere, of, work, and, that, goethe, would, be, surpassed, but, only, in, the, way, in, which, the, ancients, can, be, surpassed, in, inner, content, and, force, in, variety, and, depth, as, an, artist, actually, not, or, only, very, little, for, his, rightness, and, intensity, are, perhaps, already, more, exemplary, than, it, would, seem, many, of, goethe, s, works, especially, faust, the, roman, elegies, and, the, venetian, epigrams, depict, erotic, passions, and, acts, for, instance, in, faust, the, first, use, of, faust, s, power, after, signing, a, contract, with, the, devil, is, to, seduce, a, teenage, girl, some, of, the, venetian, epigrams, were, held, back, from, publication, due, to, their, sexual, content, goethe, clearly, saw, human, sexuality, as, a, topic, worthy, of, poetic, and, artistic, depiction, an, idea, that, was, uncommon, in, a, time, when, the, private, nature, of, sexuality, was, rigorously, normative, in, a, conversation, on, 7, april, 1830, goethe, stated, that, pederasty, is, an, aberration, that, easily, leads, to, animal, roughly, material, behavior, he, continued, pederasty, is, as, old, as, humanity, itself, and, one, can, therefore, say, that, it, resides, in, nature, even, if, it, proceeds, against, nature, what, culture, has, won, from, nature, will, not, be, surrendered, or, given, up, at, any, price, in, one, epigram, which, are, often, facetious, and, satirical, he, wrote, i, love, boys, as, well, but, girls, are, even, dearer, to, me, if, i, tire, of, her, as, a, girl, she, ll, serve, as, a, boy, for, me, as, well, goethe, was, a, freethinker, who, believed, that, one, could, be, inwardly, christian, without, following, any, of, the, christian, churches, many, of, whose, central, teachings, he, firmly, opposed, sharply, distinguishing, between, christ, and, the, tenets, of, christian, theology, and, criticizing, its, history, as, a, hodgepodge, of, mistakes, and, violence, his, own, descriptions, of, his, relationship, to, the, christian, faith, and, even, to, the, church, varied, widely, and, have, been, interpreted, even, more, widely, so, that, while, goethe, s, secretary, eckermann, portrayed, him, as, enthusiastic, about, christianity, jesus, martin, luther, and, the, protestant, reformation, even, calling, christianity, the, ultimate, religion, on, one, occasion, goethe, described, himself, as, not, anti, christian, nor, un, christian, but, most, decidedly, non, christian, and, in, his, venetian, epigram, 66, goethe, listed, the, symbol, of, the, cross, among, the, four, things, that, he, most, disliked, according, to, nietzsche, goethe, had, a, kind, of, almost, joyous, and, trusting, fatalism, that, has, faith, that, only, in, the, totality, everything, redeems, itself, and, appears, good, and, justified, born, into, a, lutheran, family, goethe, s, early, faith, was, shaken, by, news, of, such, events, as, the, 1755, lisbon, earthquake, and, the, seven, years, war, a, year, before, his, death, in, a, letter, to, sulpiz, boisser, e, goethe, wrote, that, he, had, the, feeling, that, all, his, life, he, had, been, aspiring, to, qualify, as, one, of, the, hypsistarians, an, ancient, sect, of, the, black, sea, region, who, in, his, understanding, sought, to, reverence, as, being, close, to, the, godhead, what, came, to, their, knowledge, of, the, best, and, most, perfect, goethe, s, unorthodox, religious, beliefs, led, him, to, be, called, the, great, heathen, and, provoked, distrust, among, the, authorities, of, his, time, who, opposed, the, creation, of, a, goethe, monument, on, account, of, his, offensive, religious, creed, august, wilhelm, schlegel, considered, goethe, a, heathen, who, converted, to, islam, goethe, showed, interest, in, other, religions, including, islam, although, karic, suggests, that, attempts, to, claim, goethe, for, any, religion, is, a, pointless, sysiphean, task, at, age, 23, goethe, wrote, a, poem, about, a, river, originally, part, of, a, dramatic, dialogue, which, he, published, as, a, separate, work, called, mahomets, gesang, muhammad, s, song, the, poem, s, depiction, of, nature, and, forces, within, it, is, consonant, with, his, sturm, und, drang, years, in, 1819, he, published, his, west, stlicher, divan, to, ignite, a, poetic, dialogue, between, east, and, west, politically, goethe, described, himself, as, a, moderate, liberal, he, was, critical, of, the, radicalism, of, bentham, and, expressed, sympathy, for, the, liberalism, of, fran, ois, guizot, at, the, time, of, the, french, revolution, he, thought, the, enthusiasm, of, the, students, and, professors, to, be, a, perversion, of, their, energy, and, remained, skeptical, of, the, ability, of, the, masses, to, govern, goethe, sympathized, with, the, american, revolution, and, later, wrote, a, poem, in, which, he, declared, america, you, re, better, off, than, our, continent, the, old, he, did, not, join, in, the, anti, napoleonic, mood, of, 1812, and, he, distrusted, the, strident, nationalism, which, started, to, be, expressed, the, medievalism, of, the, heidelberg, romantics, was, also, repellent, to, goethe, s, eighteenth, century, ideal, of, a, supra, national, culture, goethe, was, a, freemason, joining, the, lodge, amalia, in, weimar, in, 1780, and, frequently, alluded, to, masonic, themes, of, universal, brotherhood, in, his, work, he, was, also, attracted, to, the, bavarian, illuminati, a, secret, society, founded, on, 1, may, 1776, although, often, requested, to, write, poems, arousing, nationalist, passions, goethe, would, always, decline, in, old, age, he, explained, why, this, was, so, to, eckermann, how, could, i, write, songs, of, hatred, when, i, felt, no, hate, and, between, ourselves, i, never, hated, the, french, although, i, thanked, god, when, we, were, rid, of, them, how, could, i, to, whom, the, only, significant, things, are, civilization, and, barbarism, hate, a, nation, which, is, among, the, most, cultivated, in, the, world, and, to, which, i, owe, a, great, part, of, my, own, culture, in, any, case, this, business, of, hatred, between, nations, is, a, curious, thing, you, will, always, find, it, more, powerful, and, barbarous, on, the, lowest, levels, of, civilization, but, there, exists, a, level, at, which, it, wholly, disappears, and, where, one, stands, so, to, speak, above, the, nations, and, feels, the, weal, or, woe, of, a, neighboring, people, as, though, it, were, one, s, own, in, a, letter, written, to, leopold, casper, in, 1932, einstein, wrote, that, he, admired, goethe, as, a, poet, without, peer, and, as, one, of, the, smartest, and, wisest, men, of, all, time, he, goes, on, to, say, even, his, scholarly, ideas, deserve, to, be, held, in, high, esteem, and, his, faults, are, those, of, any, great, man, goethe, had, a, breadth, of, influence, on, the, nineteenth, century, which, in, many, respects, has, woven, itself, into, the, fabric, of, ideas, which, have, now, become, widespread, he, produced, volumes, of, poetry, essays, criticism, a, theory, of, colours, and, early, work, on, evolution, and, linguistics, he, was, fascinated, by, mineralogy, and, the, mineral, goethite, iron, oxide, is, named, after, him, his, non, fiction, writings, most, of, which, are, philosophic, and, aphoristic, in, nature, spurred, the, development, of, many, thinkers, including, georg, wilhelm, friedrich, hegel, arthur, schopenhauer, s, ren, kierkegaard, friedrich, nietzsche, ernst, cassirer, and, carl, jung, along, with, schiller, he, was, one, of, the, leading, figures, of, weimar, classicism, schopenhauer, cited, goethe, s, novel, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship,

art, over, the, next, century, his, work, could, be, lushly, emotional, and, rigorously, formal, brief, and, epigrammatic, and, epic, he, would, argue, that, classicism, was, the, means, of, controlling, art, and, that, romanticism, was, a, sickness, even, as, he, penned, poetry, rich, in, memorable, images, and, rewrote, the, formal, rules, of, german, poetry, his, poetry, was, set, to, music, by, almost, every, major, austrian, and, german, composer, from, mozart, to, mahler, and, his, influence, would, spread, to, french, drama, and, opera, as, well, beethoven, declared, that, a, faust, symphony, would, be, the, greatest, thing, for, art, liszt, and, mahler, both, created, symphonies, in, whole, or, in, large, part, inspired, by, this, seminal, work, which, would, give, the, 19th, century, one, of, its, most, paradigmatic, figures, doctor, faustus, the, faust, tragedy, drama, often, called, das, drama, der, deutschen, the, drama, of, the, germans, written, in, two, parts, published, decades, apart, would, stand, as, his, most, characteristic, and, famous, artistic, creation, followers, of, the, twentieth, century, esotericist, rudolf, steiner, built, a, theatre, named, the, goetheanum, after, him, where, festival, performances, of, faust, are, still, performed, goethe, was, also, a, cultural, force, during, his, first, meeting, with, napoleon, in, 1808, the, latter, famously, remarked, vous, tes, un, homme, you, are, a, man, the, two, discussed, politics, the, writings, of, voltaire, and, goethe, s, sorrows, of, young, werther, which, napoleon, had, read, seven, times, and, ranked, among, his, favorites, goethe, came, away, from, the, meeting, deeply, impressed, with, napoleon, s, enlightened, intellect, and, his, efforts, to, build, an, alternative, to, the, corrupt, old, regime, goethe, always, spoke, of, napoleon, with, the, greatest, respect, confessing, that, nothing, higher, and, more, pleasing, could, have, happened, to, me, in, all, my, life, than, to, have, met, napoleon, in, person, germaine, de, sta, l, in, de, l, allemagne, 1813, presented, german, classicism, and, romanticism, as, a, potential, source, of, spiritual, authority, for, europe, and, identified, goethe, as, a, living, classic, she, praised, goethe, as, possessing, the, chief, characteristics, of, the, german, genius, and, uniting, all, that, distinguishes, the, german, mind, sta, l, s, portrayal, helped, elevate, goethe, over, his, more, famous, german, contemporaries, and, transformed, him, into, a, european, cultural, hero, goethe, met, with, her, and, her, partner, benjamin, constant, with, whom, he, shared, a, mutual, admiration, in, victorian, england, goethe, s, great, disciple, was, thomas, carlyle, who, wrote, the, essays, faustus, 1822, goethe, s, helena, 1828, goethe, 1828, goethe, s, works, 1832, goethe, s, portrait, 1832, and, death, of, goethe, 1832, which, introduced, goethe, to, english, readers, translated, wilhelm, meister, s, apprenticeship, 1824, and, travels, 1826, faust, s, curse, 1830, the, tale, 1832, novelle, 1832, and, symbolum, at, a, time, when, few, read, german, and, with, whom, goethe, corresponded, goethe, exerted, a, profound, influence, on, george, eliot, whose, partner, george, henry, lewes, wrote, a, life, of, goethe, dedicated, to, carlyle, eliot, presented, goethe, as, eminently, the, man, who, helps, us, to, rise, to, a, lofty, point, of, observation, and, praised, his, large, tolerance, which, quietly, follows, the, stream, of, fact, and, of, life, without, passing, moral, judgments, matthew, arnold, found, in, goethe, the, physician, of, the, iron, age, and, the, clearest, the, largest, the, most, helpful, thinker, of, modern, times, with, a, large, liberal, view, of, life, it, was, to, a, considerable, degree, due, to, goethe, s, reputation, that, the, city, of, weimar, was, chosen, in, 1919, as, the, venue, for, the, national, assembly, convened, to, draft, a, new, constitution, for, what, would, become, known, as, germany, s, weimar, republic, goethe, became, a, key, reference, for, thomas, mann, in, his, speeches, and, essays, defending, the, republic, he, emphasized, goethe, s, cultural, and, self, developing, individualism, humanism, and, cosmopolitanism, the, federal, republic, of, germany, s, cultural, institution, the, goethe, institut, is, named, after, him, and, promotes, the, study, of, german, abroad, and, fosters, knowledge, about, germany, by, providing, information, on, its, culture, society, and, politics, the, literary, estate, of, goethe, in, the, goethe, and, schiller, archives, was, inscribed, on, unesco, s, memory, of, the, world, register, in, 2001, in, recognition, of, its, historical, significance, goethe, s, influence, was, dramatic, because, he, understood, that, there, was, a, transition, in, european, sensibilities, an, increasing, focus, on, sense, the, indescribable, and, the, emotional, this, is, not, to, say, that, he, was, emotionalistic, or, excessive, on, the, contrary, he, lauded, personal, restraint, and, felt, that, excess, was, a, disease, there, is, nothing, worse, than, imagination, without, taste, goethe, praised, francis, bacon, for, his, advocacy, of, science, based, on, experiment, and, his, forceful, revolution, in, thought, as, one, of, the, greatest, strides, forward, in, modern, science, however, he, was, critical, of, bacon, s, inductive, method, and, approach, based, on, pure, classification, he, said, in, scientific, studies, we, conceive, of, the, individual, animal, as, a, small, world, existing, for, its, own, sake, by, its, own, means, every, creature, is, its, own, reason, to, be, all, its, parts, have, a, direct, effect, on, one, another, a, relationship, to, one, another, thereby, constantly, renewing, the, circle, of, life, thus, we, are, justified, in, considering, every, animal, physiologically, perfect, viewed, from, within, no, part, of, the, animal, is, a, useless, or, arbitrary, product, of, the, formative, impulse, as, so, often, thought, externally, some, parts, may, seem, useless, because, the, inner, coherence, of, the, animal, nature, has, given, them, this, form, without, regard, to, outer, circumstance, thus, the, question, what, are, they, for, but, rather, where, do, they, come, from, goethe, s, scientific, and, aesthetic, ideas, have, much, in, common, with, denis, diderot, whose, work, he, translated, and, studied, both, diderot, and, goethe, exhibited, a, repugnance, towards, the, mathematical, interpretation, of, nature, both, perceived, the, universe, as, dynamic, and, in, constant, flux, both, saw, art, and, science, as, compatible, disciplines, linked, by, common, imaginative, processes, and, both, grasped, the, unconscious, impulses, underlying, mental, creation, in, all, forms, goethe, s, naturanschauer, is, in, many, ways, a, sequel, to, diderot, s, interpr, te, de, la, nature, his, views, make, him, along, with, adam, smith, thomas, jefferson, and, ludwig, van, beethoven, a, figure, in, two, worlds, on, the, one, hand, devoted, to, the, sense, of, taste, order, and, finely, crafted, detail, which, is, the, hallmark, of, the, artistic, sense, of, the, age, of, reason, and, the, neo, classical, period, of, architecture, on, the, other, seeking, a, personal, intuitive, and, personalized, form, of, expression, and, society, firmly, supporting, the, idea, of, self, regulating, and, organic, systems, george, henry, lewes, celebrated, goethe, s, revolutionary, understanding, of, the, organism, thinkers, such, as, ralph, waldo, emerson, would, take, up, many, similar, ideas, in, the, 1800s, goethe, s, ideas, on, evolution, would, frame, the, question, that, darwin, and, wallace, would, approach, within, the, scientific, paradigm, the, serbian, inventor, and, electrical, engineer, nikola, tesla, was, heavily, influenced, by, goethe, s, faust, his, favorite, poem, and, had, actually, memorized, the, entire, text, it, was, while, reciting, a, certain, verse, that, he, was, struck, with, the, epiphany, that, would, lead, to, the, idea, of, the, rotating, magnetic, field, and, ultimately, alternating, current, the, public, university, in, the, city, of, frankfurt, am, main, was, named, after, goethe, the, goethe, university, awards, named, after, him, category
