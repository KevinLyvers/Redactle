founded, mutualist, philosophy, and, is, considered, by, many, to, be, the, father, of, anarchism, he, was, the, first, person, to, declare, himself, an, anarchist, using, that, term, and, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, anarchism, s, most, influential, theorists, proudhon, became, a, member, of, the, french, parliament, after, the, revolution, of, 1848, whereafter, he, referred, to, himself, as, a, federalist, proudhon, described, the, liberty, he, pursued, as, the, synthesis, of, community, and, property, some, consider, his, mutualism, to, be, part, of, individualist, anarchism, while, others, regard, it, to, be, part, of, social, anarchism, proudhon, who, was, born, in, besan, on, was, a, printer, who, taught, himself, latin, in, order, to, better, print, books, in, the, language, his, best, known, assertion, is, that, property, is, theft, contained, in, his, first, major, work, what, is, property, or, an, inquiry, into, the, principle, of, right, and, government, qu, est, ce, que, la, propri, t, recherche, sur, le, principe, du, droit, et, du, gouvernement, published, in, 1840, the, book, s, publication, attracted, the, attention, of, the, french, authorities, it, also, attracted, the, scrutiny, of, karl, marx, who, started, a, correspondence, with, its, author, the, two, influenced, each, other, and, they, met, in, paris, while, marx, was, exiled, there, their, friendship, finally, ended, when, marx, responded, to, proudhon, s, the, system, of, economic, contradictions, or, the, philosophy, of, poverty, with, the, provocatively, titled, the, poverty, of, philosophy, the, dispute, became, one, of, the, sources, of, the, split, between, the, anarchist, and, marxist, wings, of, the, international, working, men, s, association, some, such, as, edmund, wilson, have, contended, that, marx, s, attack, on, proudhon, had, its, origin, in, the, latter, s, defense, of, karl, gr, n, whom, marx, bitterly, disliked, but, who, had, been, preparing, translations, of, proudhon, s, work, proudhon, favored, workers, councils, and, associations, or, cooperatives, as, well, as, individual, worker, peasant, possession, over, private, ownership, or, the, nationalization, of, land, and, workplaces, he, considered, social, revolution, to, be, achievable, in, a, peaceful, manner, proudhon, unsuccessfully, tried, to, create, a, national, bank, to, be, funded, by, what, became, an, abortive, attempt, at, an, income, tax, on, capitalists, and, shareholders, similar, in, some, respects, to, a, credit, union, it, would, have, given, interest, free, loans, after, the, death, of, his, follower, mikhail, bakunin, proudhon, s, libertarian, socialism, diverged, into, individualist, anarchism, collectivist, anarchism, anarcho, communism, and, anarcho, syndicalism, with, notable, proponents, such, as, carlo, cafiero, joseph, d, jacque, peter, kropotkin, and, benjamin, tucker, proudhon, was, born, in, besan, on, france, on, 15, january, 1809, at, 23, rue, du, petit, battant, in, the, suburb, of, battant, his, father, claude, fran, ois, proudhon, who, worked, as, a, brewer, and, a, cooper, was, originally, from, the, village, of, chasnans, near, the, border, with, switzerland, his, mother, catherine, simonin, was, from, cordiron, claude, fran, ois, and, catherine, had, five, boys, together, two, of, whom, died, at, a, very, young, age, proudhon, s, brothers, jean, etienne, and, claude, were, born, in, 1811, and, 1816, respectively, and, both, maintained, a, very, close, relationship, with, proudhon, as, a, boy, he, mostly, worked, in, the, family, tavern, helped, with, basic, agricultural, work, and, spent, time, playing, outdoors, in, the, countryside, although, proudhon, received, no, formal, education, as, a, child, he, was, taught, to, read, by, his, mother, who, had, him, spelling, words, by, age, three, the, only, books, that, proudhon, was, exposed, to, until, he, was, 10, were, the, gospels, and, the, four, aymon, brothers, and, some, local, almanacs, in, 1820, proudhon, s, mother, began, trying, to, get, him, admitted, into, the, city, college, in, besan, on, the, family, was, far, too, poor, to, afford, the, tuition, but, with, the, help, of, one, of, claude, fran, ois, former, employers, she, managed, to, gain, a, bursary, which, deducted, 120, francs, a, year, from, the, cost, proudhon, was, unable, to, afford, basic, things, like, books, or, shoes, to, attend, school, which, caused, him, great, difficulties, and, often, made, him, the, object, of, scorn, by, his, wealthier, classmates, despite, this, proudhon, showed, a, strong, will, to, learn, and, spent, much, time, in, the, school, library, with, a, pile, of, books, exploring, a, variety, of, subjects, in, his, free, time, outside, of, class, in, 1827, proudhon, began, an, apprenticeship, at, a, printing, press, in, the, house, of, bellevaux, in, battant, on, easter, of, the, following, year, he, transferred, to, a, press, in, besan, on, owned, by, the, family, of, one, of, his, schoolmates, antoine, gauthier, besan, on, was, an, important, center, of, religious, thought, at, the, time, and, most, of, the, works, published, at, gauthier, were, ecclesiastical, works, during, the, course, of, his, work, proudhon, spent, hours, every, day, reading, this, christian, literature, and, began, to, question, many, of, his, long, held, religious, beliefs, which, eventually, led, him, to, reject, christianity, altogether, in, his, first, book, what, is, property, he, revealed, that, his, religious, journey, began, with, protestantism, and, ended, with, being, a, neo, christian, over, the, years, proudhon, rose, to, be, a, corrector, for, the, press, proofreading, publications, by, 1829, he, had, become, more, interested, in, social, issues, than, in, religious, theory, of, particular, importance, during, this, period, was, his, encounter, with, charles, fourier, who, in, 1829, came, to, gauthier, as, a, customer, seeking, to, publish, his, work, le, nouveau, monde, industriel, et, soci, taire, proudhon, supervised, the, printing, of, the, book, which, gave, him, ample, opportunity, to, talk, with, fourier, about, a, variety, of, social, and, philosophical, issues, these, discussions, left, a, strong, impression, on, proudhon, and, influenced, him, throughout, his, life, it, was, also, during, this, time, that, proudhon, formed, one, of, his, closest, friendships, with, gustave, fallot, a, scholar, from, monteb, liard, who, came, from, a, family, of, wealthy, french, industrialists, impressed, by, proudhon, s, corrections, of, one, of, his, latin, manuscripts, fallot, sought, out, his, friendship, and, the, two, were, soon, regularly, spending, their, evenings, together, discussing, french, literature, by, michel, de, montaigne, fran, ois, rabelais, jean, jacques, rousseau, voltaire, denis, diderot, and, many, other, authors, to, whom, proudhon, had, not, been, exposed, during, his, years, of, theological, readings, in, september, 1830, proudhon, became, certified, as, a, journeyman, compositor, the, period, following, this, was, marked, by, unemployment, and, poverty, with, proudhon, travelling, around, france, also, briefly, to, neuch, tel, switzerland, where, he, unsuccessfully, sought, stable, employment, in, printing, and, as, a, schoolteacher, during, this, period, fallot, offered, financial, assistance, to, proudhon, if, he, came, to, paris, to, study, philosophy, proudhon, accepted, his, offer, despite, concerns, about, how, it, might, disrupt, his, career, in, the, printing, trade, he, walked, from, besan, on, to, paris, arriving, in, march, at, the, rue, mazarin, in, the, latin, quarter, where, fallot, was, living, at, the, time, proudhon, began, mingling, amongst, the, circle, of, metropolitan, scholars, surrounding, fallot, but, he, felt, out, of, place, and, uncomfortable, amidst, people, who, were, both, wealthier, and, more, accustomed, to, scholarly, debate, ultimately, proudhon, found, that, he, preferred, to, spend, the, majority, of, his, time, studying, alone, and, was, not, fond, of, urban, life, longing, to, return, home, to, besan, on, the, cholera, outbreak, in, paris, granted, him, his, wish, as, fallot, was, struck, with, the, illness, making, him, unable, to, financially, support, proudhon, any, longer, after, proudhon, left, he, never, saw, fallot, who, died, in, 1836, again, however, this, friendship, was, one, of, the, most, important, events, in, proudhon, s, life, as, it, is, what, motivated, him, to, leave, the, printing, trade, and, pursue, his, studies, of, philosophy, instead, after, an, unsuccessful, printing, business, venture, in, 1838, proudhon, decided, to, dedicate, himself, fully, to, scholarly, pursuits, he, applied, for, the, suard, pension, a, bursary, that, would, enable, him, to, study, at, the, academy, of, besan, on, proudhon, was, selected, out, of, several, candidates, primarily, due, to, the, fact, that, his, income, was, much, lower, than, the, others, and, the, judges, were, extremely, impressed, by, his, writing, and, the, level, of, education, he, had, given, himself, while, working, as, an, artisan, proudhon, arrived, in, paris, towards, the, end, of, autumn, in, 1838, in, 1839, the, academy, of, besan, on, held, an, essay, competition, on, the, subject, of, the, utility, of, the, celebration, of, sunday, regarding, hygiene, morality, and, the, relationship, of, the, family, and, the, city, proudhon, s, entry, titled, de, la, c, l, bration, du, dimanche, essentially, used, the, essay, subject, as, a, pretext, for, discussing, a, variety, of, political, and, philosophical, ideas, and, in, it, one, can, find, the, seeds, of, his, later, revolutionary, ideas, many, of, his, ideas, on, authority, morality, and, property, disturbed, the, essay, judges, at, the, academy, and, proudhon, was, only, awarded, the, bronze, medal, something, in, which, proudhon, took, pride, because, he, felt, that, this, was, an, indicator, that, his, writing, made, elite, academics, uncomfortable, in, 1840, proudhon, published, his, first, work, qu, est, ce, que, la, propri, t, or, what, is, property, his, third, memoir, on, property, was, a, letter, to, the, fourierist, writer, consid, rant, published, in, 1842, under, the, title, warning, to, proprietors, proudhon, was, tried, for, it, at, besan, on, but, he, was, acquitted, when, the, jury, found, that, they, could, not, condemn, him, for, a, philosophy, that, they, themselves, could, not, understand, in, 1846, he, published, the, syst, me, des, contradictions, conomiques, ou, philosophie, de, la, mis, re, the, system, of, economic, contradictions, or, the, philosophy, of, poverty, which, prompted, a, book, length, critique, from, karl, marx, entitled, the, poverty, of, philosophy, commencing, a, rift, between, anarchism, and, marxism, and, anarchists, and, marxists, that, would, be, continued, by, the, bakuninists, and, collectivist, anarchists, the, followers, of, mikhail, bakunin, in, the, first, international, and, that, lasts, to, this, day, for, some, time, proudhon, ran, a, small, printing, establishment, at, besan, on, but, without, success, afterwards, he, became, connected, as, a, kind, of, manager, with, a, commercial, firm, in, lyon, france, in, 1847, he, left, this, job, and, finally, settled, in, paris, where, he, was, now, becoming, celebrated, as, a, leader, of, innovation, in, this, year, he, also, became, a, freemason, in, spain, ram, n, de, la, sagra, established, the, anarchist, journal, el, porvenir, in, la, coru, a, in, 1845, which, was, inspired, by, proudhon, s, ideas, catalan, politician, francesc, pi, i, margall, became, the, principal, translator, of, proudhon, s, works, into, spanish, and, later, briefly, became, president, of, spain, in, 1873, while, being, the, leader, of, the, federal, democratic, republican, party, according, to, george, woodcock, hese, translations, were, to, have, a, profound, and, lasting, effect, on, the, development, of, spanish, anarchism, after, 1870, but, before, that, time, proudhonian, ideas, as, interpreted, by, pi, already, provided, much, of, the, inspiration, for, the, federalist, movement, which, sprang, up, in, the, early, 1860s, according, to, the, encyclop, dia, britannica, uring, the, spanish, revolution, of, 1873, pi, i, margall, attempted, to, establish, a, decentralized, or, cantonalist, political, system, on, proudhonian, lines, proudhon, died, in, passy, on, 19, january, 1865, and, was, buried, in, paris, at, montparnasse, cemetery, proudhon, was, the, first, person, known, to, refer, to, himself, as, an, anarchist, proudhon, s, anarchist, mutualism, is, considered, as, a, middle, way, or, synthesis, between, individualist, anarchism, and, social, anarchism, according, to, larry, gambone, proudhon, was, a, social, individualist, anarchist, both, anarcho, communist, peter, kropotkin, and, individualist, anarchist, benjamin, tucker, defined, anarchism, as, the, no, government, form, of, socialism, and, the, abolition, of, the, state, and, the, abolition, of, usury, respectively, in, this, kropotkin, and, tucker, were, following, the, definition, of, proudhon, who, stated, that, e, do, not, admit, the, government, of, man, by, man, any, more, than, the, exploitation, of, man, by, man, in, what, is, property, published, in, 1840, proudhon, defined, anarchy, as, the, absence, of, a, master, of, a, sovereign, and, wrote, that, s, man, seeks, justice, in, equality, so, society, seeks, order, in, anarchy, in, 1849, proudhon, declared, in, confessions, of, a, revolutionary, that, hoever, lays, his, hand, on, me, to, govern, me, is, a, usurper, and, tyrant, and, i, declare, him, my, enemy, proudhon, was, critical, of, state, authority, and, supported, freedom, of, religion, speech, and, assembly, in, the, general, idea, of, the, revolution, 1851, proudhon, urged, a, society, without, authority, in, a, subchapter, called, what, is, government, proudhon, wrote, to, be, governed, is, to, be, watched, inspected, spied, upon, directed, law, driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached, at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by, creatures, who, have, neither, the, right, nor, the, wisdom, nor, the, virtue, to, do, so, to, be, governed, is, to, be, at, every, operation, at, every, transaction, noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished, it, is, under, pretext, of, public, utility, and, in, the, name, of, the, general, interest, to, be, place, under, contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted, from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed, then, at, the, slightest, resistance, the, first, word, of, complaint, to, be, repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted, down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed, and, to, crown, all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored, that, is, government, that, is, its, justice, that, is, its, morality, towards, the, end, of, his, life, proudhon, modified, some, of, his, earlier, views, in, the, principle, of, federation, 1863, proudhon, modified, his, earlier, anti, state, position, arguing, for, the, balancing, of, authority, by, liberty, and, put, forward, a, decentralized, theory, of, federal, government, proudhon, also, defined, anarchy, differently, as, the, government, of, each, by, himself, which, meant, that, political, functions, have, been, reduced, to, industrial, functions, and, that, social, order, arises, from, nothing, but, transactions, and, exchanges, this, work, also, saw, proudhon, call, his, economic, system, an, agro, industrial, federation, arguing, that, it, would, provide, specific, federal, arrangements, to, protect, the, citizens, of, the, federated, states, from, capitalist, and, financial, feudalism, both, within, them, and, from, the, outside, and, so, stop, the, re, introduction, of, wage, labour, this, was, because, political, right, requires, to, be, buttressed, by, economic, right, in, the, posthumously, published, theory, of, property, proudhon, argued, that, property, is, the, only, power, that, can, act, as, a, counterweight, to, the, state, hence, proudhon, could, retain, the, idea, of, property, as, theft, and, at, the, same, time, offer, a, new, definition, of, it, as, liberty, there, is, the, constant, possibility, of, abuse, exploitation, which, spells, theft, at, the, same, time, property, is, a, spontaneous, creation, of, society, and, a, bulwark, against, the, ever, encroaching, power, of, the, state, daniel, gu, rin, criticized, proudhon, s, later, life, by, stating, that, many, of, these, masters, were, not, anarchists, throughout, their, lives, and, their, complete, works, include, passages, which, have, nothing, to, do, with, anarchism, to, take, an, example, in, the, second, part, of, his, career, proudhon, s, thinking, took, a, conservative, turn, his, verbose, and, monumental, de, la, justice, dans, la, revolution, et, dans, l, eglise, 1858, was, mainly, concerned, with, the, problem, of, religion, and, its, conclusion, was, far, from, libertarian, in, what, is, property, proudhon, moved, on, from, the, rejection, of, communism, and, private, property, in, a, dialectical, manner, looking, for, a, third, form, of, society, this, third, form, of, society, the, synthesis, of, communism, and, property, we, will, call, liberty, in, his, system, of, economic, contradiction, proudhon, described, mutuality, as, the, synthesis, of, the, notions, of, private, property, and, collective, ownership, proudhon, s, rejection, of, compulsory, communism, and, privileged, property, led, him, towards, a, synthesis, of, libertarian, communism, and, possession, just, as, the, apparent, contradiction, between, his, theories, of, property, represents, an, antithesis, which, still, needs, synthesizing, proudhon, stated, that, in, presenting, the, property, is, liberty, theory, he, is, not, changing, his, mind, about, the, earlier, property, is, theft, definition, proudhon, did, not, only, rely, on, synthesis, but, also, emphasized, balance, between, approaches, such, as, communism, and, property, that, apparently, cannot, be, fully, reconciled, american, mutualist, william, batchelder, greene, took, a, similar, approach, in, his, 1849, 1850, works, for, proudhon, mutualism, involved, free, association, by, creating, industrial, democracy, a, system, where, workplaces, would, be, handed, over, to, democratically, organised, workers, associations, we, want, these, associations, to, be, models, for, agriculture, industry, and, trade, the, pioneering, core, of, that, vast, federation, of, companies, and, societies, woven, into, the, common, cloth, of, the, democratic, social, republic, under, mutualism, workers, would, no, longer, sell, their, labour, to, a, capitalist, but, rather, work, for, themselves, in, co, operatives, proudhon, urged, workers, to, form, themselves, into, democratic, societies, with, equal, conditions, for, all, members, on, pain, of, a, relapse, into, feudalism, this, would, result, in, apitalistic, and, proprietary, exploitation, stopped, everywhere, the, wage, system, abolished, equal, and, just, exchange, guaranteed, as, robert, graham, notes, proudhon, s, market, socialism, is, indissolubly, linked, to, his, notions, of, industrial, democracy, and, workers, self, management, k, steven, vincent, notes, in, his, in, depth, analysis, of, this, aspect, of, proudhon, s, ideas, that, proudhon, consistently, advanced, a, program, of, industrial, democracy, which, would, return, control, and, direction, of, the, economy, to, the, workers, for, proudhon, strong, workers, associations, would, enable, the, workers, to, determine, jointly, by, election, how, the, enterprise, was, to, be, directed, and, operated, on, a, day, to, day, basis, proudhon, adopted, the, term, mutualism, for, his, brand, of, anarchism, and, socialism, which, involved, control, of, the, means, of, production, by, the, workers, in, his, vision, self, employed, artisans, peasants, and, cooperatives, would, trade, their, products, on, the, market, for, proudhon, factories, and, other, large, workplaces, would, be, run, by, labor, associations, operating, on, directly, democratic, principles, the, state, would, be, abolished, and, instead, society, would, be, organized, by, a, federation, of, free, communes, a, commune, is, a, local, municipality, in, french, in, 1863, proudhon, wrote, all, my, economic, ideas, as, developed, over, twenty, five, years, can, be, summed, up, in, the, words, agricultural, industrial, federation, all, my, political, ideas, boil, down, to, a, similar, formula, political, federation, or, decentralization, proudhon, called, this, use, ownership, possession, possession, and, this, economic, system, mutualism, mutualisme, having, many, arguments, against, entitlement, to, land, and, capital, including, reasons, based, on, morality, economics, politics, and, individual, liberty, one, such, argument, was, that, it, enabled, profit, which, in, turn, led, to, social, instability, and, war, by, creating, cycles, of, debt, that, eventually, overcame, the, capacity, of, labor, to, pay, them, off, another, was, that, it, produced, despotism, and, turned, workers, into, wage, workers, subject, to, the, authority, of, a, boss, in, what, is, property, proudhon, described, the, liberty, he, pursued, as, the, synthesis, of, communism, and, property, further, writing, property, acting, by, exclusion, and, encroachment, while, population, was, increasing, has, been, the, life, principle, and, definitive, cause, of, all, revolutions, religious, wars, and, wars, of, conquest, when, they, have, stopped, short, of, the, extermination, of, races, have, been, only, accidental, disturbances, soon, repaired, by, the, mathematical, progression, of, the, life, of, nations, the, downfall, and, death, of, societies, are, due, to, the, power, of, accumulation, possessed, by, property, proudhon, continued, to, oppose, both, capitalist, and, state, property, in, theory, of, property, proudhon, maintained, that, ow, in, 1840, i, categorically, rejected, the, notion, of, property, for, both, the, group, and, the, individual, but, then, he, also, states, his, new, theory, of, property, that, property, is, the, greatest, revolutionary, force, which, exists, with, an, unequaled, capacity, for, setting, itself, against, authority, and, the, principal, function, of, private, property, within, the, political, system, will, be, to, act, as, a, counterweight, to, the, power, of, the, state, and, by, so, doing, to, insure, the, liberty, of, the, individual, however, the, authors, of, an, anarchist, faq, write, that, this, is, a, common, anarchist, position, anarchists, are, well, aware, that, possession, is, a, source, of, independence, within, capitalism, and, so, should, be, supported, at, the, same, time, proudhon, continued, to, oppose, concentrations, of, wealth, and, property, arguing, for, small, scale, property, ownership, associated, with, peasants, and, artisans, proudhon, also, still, opposed, private, property, in, land, writing, what, i, cannot, accept, regarding, land, is, that, the, work, put, in, gives, a, right, to, ownership, of, what, has, been, worked, on, in, addition, proudhon, still, believed, that, property, should, be, more, equally, distributed, and, limited, in, size, to, that, actually, used, by, individuals, families, and, workers, associations, proudhon, supported, the, right, of, inheritance, and, defended, it, as, one, of, the, foundations, of, the, family, and, society, but, he, refused, to, extend, this, beyond, personal, possessions, arguing, that, nder, the, law, of, association, transmission, of, wealth, does, not, apply, to, the, instruments, of, labour, as, a, consequence, of, his, opposition, to, profit, wage, labour, worker, exploitation, ownership, of, land, and, capital, as, well, as, to, state, property, proudhon, rejected, both, capitalism, and, state, socialism, including, authoritarian, socialism, and, other, authoritarian, and, compulsory, forms, of, communism, which, advocated, state, property, the, authors, of, an, anarchist, faq, argue, that, his, opposition, to, communism, was, because, libertarian, communism, while, having, some, forerunners, such, as, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, would, not, be, as, widespread, until, after, his, death, and, so, like, max, stirner, he, was, directing, his, critique, against, the, various, forms, of, state, communism, which, did, while, opposed, to, the, charging, of, interest, and, rent, proudhon, did, not, seek, to, abolish, them, by, law, writing, i, protest, that, when, i, criticized, the, complex, of, institutions, of, which, property, is, the, foundation, stone, i, never, meant, to, forbid, or, suppress, by, sovereign, decree, ground, rent, and, interest, on, capital, i, think, that, all, these, manifestations, of, human, activity, should, remain, free, and, voluntary, for, all, i, ask, for, them, no, modifications, restrictions, or, suppressions, other, than, those, which, result, naturally, and, of, necessity, from, the, universalization, of, the, principle, of, reciprocity, which, i, propose, proudhon, opposed, dictatorship, militarism, nationalism, and, war, arguing, that, the, end, of, militarism, is, the, mission, of, the, nineteenth, century, under, pain, of, indefinite, decadence, and, that, the, workers, alone, are, capable, of, putting, an, end, to, war, by, creating, economic, equilibrium, this, presupposes, a, radical, revolution, in, ideas, and, morals, as, robert, l, hoffman, notes, war, and, peace, ends, by, condemning, war, without, reservation, and, its, conclusion, that, war, is, obsolete, marxist, philosopher, john, ehrenberg, summarized, proudhon, s, position, that, f, injustice, was, the, cause, of, war, it, followed, that, conflict, could, not, be, eliminated, until, society, was, reorganised, along, egalitarian, lines, proudhon, had, wanted, to, prove, that, the, reign, of, political, economy, would, be, the, reign, of, peace, finding, it, difficult, to, believe, that, people, really, thought, he, was, defending, militarism, proudhon, argued, that, under, mutualism, here, will, no, longer, be, nationality, no, longer, fatherland, in, the, political, sense, of, the, words, they, will, mean, only, places, of, birth, man, of, whatever, race, or, colour, he, may, be, is, an, inhabitant, of, the, universe, citizenship, is, everywhere, an, acquired, right, proudhon, also, rejected, dictatorship, stating, in, the, 1860s, that, what, i, will, always, be, a, republican, a, democrat, even, and, a, socialist, into, the, bargain, henri, marie, de, lubac, argued, that, in, terms, of, proudhon, s, critique, of, democracy, we, must, not, allow, all, this, to, hoodwink, us, his, invectives, against, democracy, were, not, those, of, a, counter, revolutionary, they, were, aimed, at, what, he, himself, called, the, false, democracy, they, attacked, an, apparently, liberal, pseudo, democracy, which, was, not, economic, and, social, a, jacobinical, democracy, proudhon, did, not, want, to, destroy, but, complete, the, work, of, 1789, and, while, he, had, a, grudge, against, the, old, democracy, the, democracy, of, robespierre, and, marat, he, repeatedly, contrasted, it, with, a, young, democracy, which, was, a, social, democracy, according, to, historian, of, anarchism, george, woodcock, some, positions, proudhon, took, sorted, oddly, with, his, avowed, anarchism, woodcock, cited, as, an, example, proudhon, s, proposition, that, each, citizen, perform, one, or, two, years, militia, service, the, proposal, appeared, in, the, programme, revolutionaire, an, electoral, manifesto, issued, by, proudhon, after, he, was, asked, to, run, for, a, position, in, the, provisional, government, the, text, reads, 7, l, arm, e, abolition, imm, diate, de, la, conscription, et, des, remplacements, obligation, pour, tout, citoyen, de, faire, pendant, un, ou, deux, ans, le, service, militaire, application, de, l, arm, e, aux, services, administratifs, et, travaux, d, utilit, publique, military, service, by, all, citizens, is, proposed, as, an, alternative, to, conscription, and, the, practice, of, replacement, by, which, those, who, could, avoided, such, service, in, the, same, document, proudhon, also, described, the, form, of, government, he, was, proposing, as, a, centralization, analogous, with, that, of, the, state, but, in, which, no, one, obeys, no, one, is, dependent, and, everyone, is, free, and, sovereign, proudhon, saw, the, privileged, property, as, a, form, of, government, that, was, necessarily, backed, by, and, interlinked, with, the, state, writing, that, he, private, property, of, privilege, called, forth, and, commanded, the, state, and, arguing, that, since, the, first, related, to, the, landowner, and, capitalist, whose, ownership, derived, from, conquest, or, exploitation, and, was, only, maintained, through, the, state, its, property, laws, police, and, army, hence, proudhon, distinguished, between, personal, property, and, possessions, possession, and, private, property, propri, t, i, e, productive, property, while, the, former, having, direct, use, value, to, the, individual, possessing, it, unlike, capitalist, property, supporters, proudhon, stressed, equality, and, thought, that, all, workers, should, own, property, and, have, access, to, capital, stressing, that, in, every, cooperative, every, worker, employed, in, the, association, an, undivided, share, in, the, property, of, the, company, in, his, later, works, proudhon, used, property, to, mean, possession, this, resulted, in, some, individualist, anarchists, such, as, benjamin, tucker, calling, possession, as, property, or, private, property, causing, confusion, within, the, anarchist, movement, and, among, other, socialists, in, his, earliest, works, proudhon, analyzed, the, nature, and, problems, of, the, capitalist, economy, while, deeply, critical, of, capitalism, proudhon, also, objected, to, those, contemporary, in, the, socialist, movement, who, advocated, centralized, hierarchical, forms, of, association, or, state, control, of, the, economy, in, a, sequence, of, commentaries, from, what, is, property, 1840, posthumously, published, in, the, th, orie, de, la, propri, t, theory, of, property, 1863, 1864, proudhon, declared, in, turn, that, property, is, theft, property, is, impossible, property, is, despotism, and, property, is, freedom, when, saying, that, property, is, theft, proudhon, was, referring, to, the, landowner, or, capitalist, who, he, believed, stole, the, profits, from, laborers, for, proudhon, as, he, wrote, in, the, sixth, study, of, his, general, idea, of, the, revolution, in, the, nineteenth, century, the, capitalist, s, employee, was, subordinated, exploited, his, permanent, condition, is, one, of, obedience, in, what, is, property, proudhon, also, wrote, property, is, physically, and, mathematically, impossible, property, is, impossible, because, it, demands, something, for, nothing, property, is, impossible, because, wherever, it, exists, production, costs, more, than, it, is, worth, property, is, impossible, because, with, a, given, capital, production, is, proportional, to, labor, not, to, property, property, is, impossible, because, it, is, homicide, yes, i, have, attacked, property, and, shall, attack, it, again, property, is, robbery, the, people, finally, legalized, property, god, forgive, them, for, they, knew, not, what, they, did, proudhon, believed, that, illegitimate, property, was, based, on, dominion, i, e, entitlement, and, that, this, was, backed, by, force, while, this, force, can, take, the, form, of, police, in, the, employ, of, a, state, it, is, the, fact, of, its, enforcement, not, its, form, that, makes, it, what, it, is, proudhon, rejected, entitlement, regardless, of, the, source, and, accepted, possession, based, on, occupancy, according, to, proudhon, here, are, different, kinds, of, property, 1, property, pure, and, simple, the, dominant, and, seigniorial, power, over, a, thing, or, as, they, term, it, naked, property, 2, possession, possession, says, duranton, is, a, matter, of, fact, not, of, right, toullier, property, is, a, right, a, legal, power, possession, is, a, fact, the, tenant, the, farmer, the, commandit, the, usufructuary, are, possessors, the, owner, who, lets, and, lends, for, use, the, heir, who, is, to, come, into, possession, on, the, death, of, a, usufructuary, are, proprietors, in, confessions, of, a, revolutionary, proudhon, also, wrote, capital, in, the, political, field, is, analogous, to, government, the, economic, idea, of, capitalism, the, politics, of, government, or, of, authority, and, the, theological, idea, of, the, church, are, three, identical, ideas, linked, in, various, ways, to, attack, one, of, them, is, equivalent, to, attacking, all, of, them, what, capital, does, to, labour, and, the, state, to, liberty, the, church, does, to, the, spirit, this, trinity, of, absolutism, is, as, baneful, in, practice, as, it, is, in, philosophy, the, most, effective, means, for, oppressing, the, people, would, be, simultaneously, to, enslave, its, body, its, will, and, its, reason, in, asserting, that, property, is, freedom, proudhon, was, referring, not, only, to, the, product, of, an, individual, s, labor, but, also, to, the, peasant, or, artisan, s, home, and, tools, of, his, trade, and, the, income, he, received, by, selling, his, goods, for, proudhon, the, only, legitimate, source, of, property, is, labor, what, one, produces, is, one, s, property, and, anything, beyond, that, is, not, proudhon, advocated, workers, self, management, and, was, opposed, to, the, private, ownership, of, the, means, of, production, in, 1848, proudhon, wrote, under, the, law, of, association, transmission, of, wealth, does, not, apply, to, the, instruments, of, labour, so, cannot, become, a, cause, of, inequality, we, are, socialists, under, universal, association, ownership, of, the, land, and, of, the, instruments, of, labour, is, social, ownership, we, want, the, mines, canals, railways, handed, over, to, democratically, organised, workers, associations, we, want, these, associations, to, be, models, for, agriculture, industry, and, trade, the, pioneering, core, of, that, vast, federation, of, companies, and, societies, joined, together, in, the, common, bond, of, the, democratic, and, social, republic, proudhon, also, warned, that, a, society, with, private, property, would, lead, to, statist, relations, between, people, arguing, the, purchaser, draws, boundaries, fences, himself, in, and, says, this, is, mine, each, one, by, himself, each, one, for, himself, here, then, is, a, piece, of, land, upon, which, henceforth, no, one, has, right, to, step, save, the, proprietor, and, his, friends, which, can, benefit, nobody, save, the, proprietor, and, his, servants, let, these, multiply, and, soon, the, people, will, have, nowhere, to, rest, no, place, of, shelter, no, ground, to, till, they, will, die, of, hunger, at, the, proprietor, s, door, on, the, edge, of, that, property, which, was, their, birth, right, and, the, proprietor, watching, them, die, will, exclaim, so, perish, idlers, and, vagrants, according, to, proudhon, he, proprietor, the, robber, the, hero, the, sovereign, for, all, these, titles, are, synonymous, imposes, his, will, as, law, and, suffers, neither, contradiction, nor, control, that, is, he, pretends, to, be, the, legislative, and, the, executive, power, at, once, property, engenders, despotism, that, is, so, clearly, the, essence, of, property, that, to, be, convinced, of, it, one, need, but, remember, what, it, is, and, observe, what, happens, around, him, property, is, the, right, to, use, and, abuse, f, goods, are, property, why, should, not, the, proprietors, be, kings, and, despotic, kings, kings, in, proportion, to, their, facultes, bonitaires, and, if, each, proprietor, is, sovereign, lord, within, the, sphere, of, his, property, absolute, king, throughout, his, own, domain, how, could, a, government, of, proprietors, be, any, thing, but, chaos, and, confusion, george, crowder, writes, that, the, property, anarchists, including, proudhon, oppose, is, basically, that, which, is, unearned, i, e, such, things, as, interest, on, loans, and, income, from, rent, this, is, contrasted, with, ownership, rights, in, those, goods, either, produced, by, the, work, of, the, owner, or, necessary, for, that, work, for, example, his, dwelling, house, land, and, tools, proudhon, initially, refers, to, legitimate, rights, of, ownership, of, these, goods, as, possession, and, although, in, his, latter, work, he, calls, this, property, the, conceptual, distinction, remains, the, same, late, in, his, life, proudhon, argued, for, increasing, the, powers, of, government, while, also, strengthening, property, by, making, it, more, egalitarian, and, widespread, in, order, to, counter, balance, it, iain, mckay, points, out, that, proudhon, s, emphasis, on, the, genuine, antagonism, between, state, power, and, property, rights, came, from, his, later, writings, in, which, he, argued, that, property, rights, were, required, to, control, state, power, in, other, words, this, heterodoxy, came, from, a, period, in, which, proudhon, did, not, think, that, state, could, be, abolished, and, so, property, is, the, only, power, that, can, act, as, a, counterweight, to, the, state, of, course, this, later, proudhon, also, acknowledged, that, property, was, an, absolutism, within, an, absolutism, by, nature, autocratic, and, that, its, politics, could, be, summed, up, in, a, single, word, namely, exploitation, mckay, further, writes, how, proudhon, argues, that, spread, it, more, equally, and, establish, it, more, firmly, in, society, is, the, means, by, which, property, becomes, a, guarantee, of, liberty, and, keeps, the, state, on, an, even, keel, in, other, words, rather, than, property, as, such, limiting, the, state, it, is, property, divided, equally, through, society, which, is, the, key, without, concentrations, of, economic, power, and, inequality, which, would, result, in, exploitation, and, oppression, therefore, imple, justice, requires, that, equal, division, of, land, shall, not, only, operate, at, the, outset, if, there, is, to, be, no, abuse, it, must, be, maintained, from, generation, to, generation, david, hargreaves, writes, that, ronically, proudhon, did, not, mean, literally, what, he, said, his, boldness, of, expression, was, intended, for, emphasis, and, by, property, he, wished, to, be, understood, what, he, later, called, the, sum, of, its, abuses, he, was, denouncing, the, property, of, the, man, who, uses, it, to, exploit, the, labour, of, others, without, any, effort, on, his, own, part, property, distinguished, by, interest, and, rent, by, the, impositions, of, the, non, producer, on, the, producer, towards, property, regarded, as, possession, the, right, of, a, man, to, control, his, dwelling, and, the, land, and, tools, he, needs, to, live, proudhon, had, no, hostility, indeed, he, regarded, it, as, the, cornerstone, of, liberty, and, his, main, criticism, of, the, communists, was, that, they, wished, to, destroy, it, nonetheless, communists, ranging, from, peter, kropotkin, to, karl, marx, and, friedrich, engels, agreed, with, proudhon, s, distinction, and, were, not, opposed, to, personal, property, or, what, proudhon, called, possession, nor, they, wished, to, abolish, it, while, proudhon, identified, as, a, revolutionary, his, idea, of, revolution, did, not, entail, civil, war, or, violent, upheaval, but, rather, the, transformation, of, society, this, transformation, was, essentially, moral, in, nature, and, demanded, the, highest, ethics, from, those, who, sought, change, it, was, monetary, reform, combined, with, organizing, a, credit, bank, and, workers, associations, that, proudhon, proposed, to, use, as, a, lever, to, bring, about, the, organization, of, society, along, new, lines, this, ethical, socialism, has, been, described, as, part, of, the, liberal, socialist, tradition, which, is, for, egalitarianism, and, free, markets, with, proudhon, among, other, anarchists, taking, a, commitment, to, narrow, down, the, sphere, of, activity, of, the, state, james, boyle, quotes, proudhon, as, stating, that, socialism, is, every, aspiration, towards, the, amelioration, of, society, and, then, admitting, that, we, are, all, socialists, under, this, definition, about, the, 1848, french, revolution, and, the, second, french, republic, proudhon, took, a, radical, stance, regarding, the, national, workshops, criticized, for, being, charity, whilst, criticizing, the, june, days, uprising, for, using, violence, proudhon, s, criticism, of, the, february, revolution, was, that, it, was, without, an, idea, and, considered, some, parts, of, the, revolution, too, moderate, and, others, too, radical, according, to, shawn, wilbur, those, contradictions, were, caused, by, his, dialectical, phase, with, the, system, of, economic, contradictions, and, was, prone, to, viewing, nearly, all, his, key, concepts, as, being, worked, out, in, terms, of, irreducible, contradictions, although, the, revolutionary, concept, of, dual, power, was, first, used, by, vladimir, lenin, it, was, conceptually, first, outlined, by, proudhon, according, to, murray, bookchin, proudhon, made, the, bright, suggestion, in, his, periodical, le, repr, sentant, du, peuple, 28, april, 1848, that, the, mass, democracy, of, the, clubs, could, become, a, popular, forum, where, the, social, agenda, of, the, revolution, could, be, prepared, for, use, by, the, constituent, assembly, a, proposal, that, would, essentially, have, defused, the, potency, of, the, clubs, as, a, potentially, rebellious, dual, power, proudhon, self, identified, as, a, socialist, and, remains, widely, recognized, as, such, as, one, of, the, first, theorists, of, libertarian, socialism, proudhon, opposed, state, ownership, of, capital, goods, in, favour, of, ownership, by, workers, themselves, in, associations, proudhon, was, one, of, the, main, influences, on, the, theory, of, workers, self, management, autogestion, in, the, late, 19th, and, 20th, century, proudhon, strenuously, rejected, the, ownership, of, the, products, of, labor, by, capitalists, or, the, state, arguing, in, what, is, property, that, while, property, in, product, does, not, carry, with, it, property, in, the, means, of, production, he, right, to, product, is, exclusive, and, the, right, to, means, is, common, proudhon, applied, this, to, the, land, the, land, is, a, common, thing, and, workplaces, all, accumulated, capital, being, social, property, no, one, can, be, its, exclusive, proprietor, proudhon, argued, that, while, society, owned, the, means, of, production, or, land, users, would, control, and, run, them, under, supervision, from, society, with, the, organising, of, regulating, societies, in, order, to, regulate, the, market, by, the, 1840s, and, 1850s, socialism, came, to, cover, a, broad, range, proudhon, s, writings, from, the, years, following, the, french, revolution, of, 1848, are, full, of, passages, in, which, he, associated, himself, with, socialism, but, he, distanced, from, any, particular, system, of, socialist, economics, or, type, of, socialism, as, a, broad, concept, socialism, is, one, or, more, of, various, theories, aimed, at, solving, the, labor, problem, through, radical, changes, in, the, capitalist, economy, descriptions, of, the, problem, explanations, of, its, causes, and, proposed, solutions, such, as, abolition, of, private, property, and, support, of, either, cooperatives, collective, property, common, property, public, property, or, social, property, varied, among, socialist, philosophies, proudhon, made, no, public, criticism, of, karl, marx, or, marxism, because, in, proudhon, s, lifetime, marx, was, relatively, unknown, it, was, only, after, proudhon, s, death, that, marxism, became, a, large, movement, however, he, criticized, authoritarian, and, state, socialists, of, his, period, this, included, the, french, socialist, louis, blanc, of, whom, proudhon, said, that, you, desire, neither, catholicism, nor, monarchy, nor, nobility, but, you, must, have, a, god, a, religion, a, dictatorship, a, censorship, a, hierarchy, distinctions, and, ranks, for, my, part, i, deny, your, god, your, authority, your, sovereignty, your, judicial, state, and, all, your, representative, mystifications, it, was, proudhon, s, book, what, is, property, that, convinced, the, young, marx, that, private, property, should, be, abolished, in, the, holy, family, one, of, his, first, works, marx, stated, not, only, does, proudhon, write, in, the, interest, of, the, proletarians, he, is, himself, a, proletarian, an, ouvrier, his, work, is, a, scientific, manifesto, of, the, french, proletariat, however, marx, disagreed, with, proudhon, s, anarchism, and, later, published, a, vicious, criticism, of, proudhon, marx, wrote, the, poverty, of, philosophy, as, a, refutation, of, proudhon, s, the, philosophy, of, poverty, in, their, letters, proudhon, expressed, disagreement, with, marx, s, views, on, revolution, stating, i, believe, we, have, no, need, of, it, in, order, to, succeed, and, that, consequently, we, should, not, put, forward, revolutionary, action, as, a, means, of, social, reform, because, that, pretended, means, would, simply, be, an, appeal, to, force, to, arbitrariness, in, brief, a, contradiction, more, than, proudhon, s, anarchism, marx, did, take, issue, with, what, he, saw, as, proudhon, s, misunderstanding, of, the, relationship, between, labor, value, and, price, as, well, as, believing, that, proudhon, s, attack, on, bourgeois, property, was, framed, in, terms, of, bourgeois, ethics, rather, than, transcending, these, ethics, altogether, anarchists, among, others, have, since, criticized, marx, and, marxists, for, having, distorted, proudhon, s, views, iain, mckay, argues, that, marx, took, many, concepts, such, as, his, criticism, of, private, property, scientific, socialism, and, surplus, value, from, proudhon, similarly, rudolf, rocker, argued, that, we, find, the, theory, of, surplus, value, that, grand, scientific, discovery, of, which, our, marxists, are, so, proud, of, in, the, writings, of, proudhon, edward, hyams, summarized, that, since, no, good, marxists, have, had, to, think, about, proudhon, they, have, what, is, mother, s, milk, to, them, an, ex, cathedra, judgement, in, spite, of, their, personal, diatribes, marx, always, maintained, a, certain, respect, for, proudhon, although, this, did, not, stop, marx, from, expelling, proudhon, s, follower, mikhail, bakunin, in, spite, of, his, criticism, of, proudhon, and, his, supporters, from, the, first, international, in, his, obituary, of, proudhon, which, was, written, on, 24, january, 1865, almost, two, decades, after, the, poverty, of, philosophy, marx, called, what, is, property, epoch, making, while, favoring, individual, ownership, for, small, property, holdings, proudhon, advocated, social, ownership, and, worker, cooperatives, or, similar, workers, associations, and, workers, councils, proudhon, advocated, industrial, democracy, and, repeatedly, argued, that, the, means, of, production, and, the, land, should, be, socialized, in, what, is, property, proudhon, wrote, that, land, is, indispensable, to, our, existence, consequently, a, common, thing, consequently, insusceptible, of, appropriation, in, a, letter, to, louis, blanqui, in, 1841, proudhon, wrote, that, all, capital, whether, material, or, mental, being, the, result, of, collective, labour, is, in, consequence, collective, property, in, his, election, manifesto, for, the, 1848, french, constituent, assembly, election, proudhon, wrote, for, this, value, or, wealth, produced, by, the, activity, of, all, is, by, the, very, fact, of, its, creation, collective, wealth, the, use, of, which, like, that, of, the, land, may, be, divided, but, which, as, property, remains, undivided, in, short, property, in, capital, is, indivisible, and, consequently, inalienable, not, necessarily, when, the, capital, is, uncreated, but, when, it, is, common, or, collective, his, non, appropriation, of, the, instruments, of, production, i, in, accordance, with, all, precedent, call, a, destruction, of, property, in, fact, without, the, appropriation, of, instruments, property, is, nothing, in, a, letter, to, pierre, leroux, in, 1849, proudhon, wrote, under, the, law, of, association, transmission, of, wealth, does, not, apply, to, the, instruments, of, labour, so, cannot, become, a, cause, of, inequality, we, are, socialists, under, universal, association, ownership, of, the, land, and, of, the, instruments, of, labour, is, social, ownership, you, have, me, saying, and, i, really, do, not, know, where, you, could, have, found, this, that, ownership, of, the, instruments, of, labour, must, forever, stay, vested, in, the, individual, and, remain, unorganised, these, words, are, set, in, italics, as, if, you, had, lifted, them, from, somewhere, in, my, books, but, it, does, not, follow, at, all, that, i, want, to, see, individual, ownership, and, non, organisation, of, the, instruments, of, labour, endure, for, all, eternity, i, have, never, penned, nor, uttered, any, such, thing, and, have, argued, the, opposite, a, hundred, times, over, i, deny, all, kinds, of, proprietary, domain, i, deny, it, precisely, because, i, believe, in, an, order, wherein, the, instruments, of, labour, will, cease, to, be, appropriated, and, instead, become, shared, where, the, whole, earth, will, be, depersonalised, although, long, considered, a, founding, father, of, anarchism, and, part, of, the, french, left, some, have, tried, to, link, him, to, the, extreme, right, he, was, first, used, as, a, reference, in, the, cercle, proudhon, a, right, wing, association, formed, in, 1911, by, georges, valois, and, edouard, berth, both, had, been, brought, together, by, the, syndicalist, georges, sorel, but, they, would, tend, toward, a, synthesis, of, socialism, and, nationalism, mixing, proudhon, s, mutualism, with, charles, maurras, integralist, nationalism, in, 1925, georges, valois, founded, the, faisceau, the, first, fascist, league, which, took, its, name, from, benito, mussolini, s, fasci, zeev, sternhell, historian, of, fascism, in, particular, of, french, fascists, noted, this, use, of, proudhon, by, the, far, right, he, action, fran, aise, from, its, inception, regarded, the, author, of, la, philosophie, de, la, mis, re, as, one, of, its, masters, he, was, given, a, place, of, honour, in, the, weekly, section, of, the, journal, of, the, movement, entitled, precisely, our, masters, proudhon, owed, this, place, in, l, action, fran, aise, to, what, the, maurrassians, saw, as, his, antirepublicanism, his, anti, semitism, his, loathing, of, rousseau, his, disdain, for, the, french, revolution, democracy, and, parliamentarianism, and, his, championship, of, the, nation, the, family, tradition, and, the, monarchy, in, response, k, steven, vincent, states, that, to, argue, that, proudhon, was, a, proto, fascist, suggests, that, one, has, never, looked, seriously, at, proudhon, s, writings, proudhon, had, great, influence, on, the, anarchist, and, non, anarchist, socialist, movement, in, the, united, states, proudhon, was, influential, within, radical, progressive, sectors, and, labour, leaders,
