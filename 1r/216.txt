quintus, horatius, flaccus, classical, latin, 8, december, 65, bc, 27, november, 8, bc, commonly, known, in, the, english, speaking, world, as, horace, h, r, s, was, the, leading, roman, lyric, poet, during, the, time, of, augustus, also, known, as, octavian, the, rhetorician, quintilian, regarded, his, odes, as, the, only, latin, lyrics, worth, reading, he, can, be, lofty, sometimes, yet, he, is, also, full, of, charm, and, grace, versatile, in, his, figures, and, felicitously, daring, in, his, choice, of, words, horace, also, crafted, elegant, hexameter, verses, satires, and, epistles, and, caustic, iambic, poetry, epodes, the, hexameters, are, amusing, yet, serious, works, friendly, in, tone, leading, the, ancient, satirist, persius, to, comment, as, his, friend, laughs, horace, slyly, puts, his, finger, on, his, every, fault, once, let, in, he, plays, about, the, heartstrings, his, career, coincided, with, rome, s, momentous, change, from, a, republic, to, an, empire, an, officer, in, the, republican, army, defeated, at, the, battle, of, philippi, in, 42, bc, he, was, befriended, by, octavian, s, right, hand, man, in, civil, affairs, maecenas, and, became, a, spokesman, for, the, new, regime, for, some, commentators, his, association, with, the, regime, was, a, delicate, balance, in, which, he, maintained, a, strong, measure, of, independence, he, was, a, master, of, the, graceful, sidestep, but, for, others, he, was, in, john, dryden, s, phrase, a, well, mannered, court, slave, horace, can, be, regarded, as, the, world, s, first, autobiographer, in, his, writings, he, tells, us, far, more, about, himself, his, character, his, development, and, his, way, of, life, than, any, other, great, poet, of, antiquity, some, of, the, biographical, material, contained, in, his, work, can, be, supplemented, from, the, short, but, valuable, life, of, horace, by, suetonius, in, his, lives, of, the, poets, he, was, born, on, 8, december, 65, bc, in, apulia, south, of, italy, his, home, town, venusia, lay, on, a, trade, route, in, the, region, of, apulia, at, the, border, with, lucania, basilicata, various, italic, dialects, were, spoken, in, the, area, and, this, perhaps, enriched, his, feeling, for, language, he, could, have, been, familiar, with, greek, words, even, as, a, young, boy, and, later, he, poked, fun, at, the, jargon, of, mixed, greek, and, oscan, spoken, in, neighbouring, canusium, one, of, the, works, he, probably, studied, in, school, was, the, odyssia, of, livius, andronicus, taught, by, teachers, like, the, orbilius, mentioned, in, one, of, his, poems, army, veterans, could, have, been, settled, there, at, the, expense, of, local, families, uprooted, by, rome, as, punishment, for, their, part, in, the, social, war, 91, 88, bc, such, state, sponsored, migration, must, have, added, still, more, linguistic, variety, to, the, area, according, to, a, local, tradition, reported, by, horace, a, colony, of, romans, or, latins, had, been, installed, in, venusia, after, the, samnites, had, been, driven, out, early, in, the, third, century, in, that, case, young, horace, could, have, felt, himself, to, be, a, roman, though, there, are, also, indications, that, he, regarded, himself, as, a, samnite, or, sabellus, by, birth, italians, in, modern, and, ancient, times, have, always, been, devoted, to, their, home, towns, even, after, success, in, the, wider, world, and, horace, was, no, different, images, of, his, childhood, setting, and, references, to, it, are, found, throughout, his, poems, horace, s, father, was, probably, a, venutian, taken, captive, by, romans, in, the, social, war, or, possibly, he, was, descended, from, a, sabine, captured, in, the, samnite, wars, either, way, he, was, a, slave, for, at, least, part, of, his, life, he, was, evidently, a, man, of, strong, abilities, however, and, managed, to, gain, his, freedom, and, improve, his, social, position, thus, horace, claimed, to, be, the, free, born, son, of, a, prosperous, coactor, the, term, coactor, could, denote, various, roles, such, as, tax, collector, but, its, use, by, horace, was, explained, by, scholia, as, a, reference, to, coactor, argentarius, i, e, an, auctioneer, with, some, of, the, functions, of, a, banker, paying, the, seller, out, of, his, own, funds, and, later, recovering, the, sum, with, interest, from, the, buyer, the, father, spent, a, small, fortune, on, his, son, s, education, eventually, accompanying, him, to, rome, to, oversee, his, schooling, and, moral, development, the, poet, later, paid, tribute, to, him, in, a, poem, that, one, modern, scholar, considers, the, best, memorial, by, any, son, to, his, father, the, poem, includes, this, passage, if, my, character, is, flawed, by, a, few, minor, faults, but, is, otherwise, decent, and, moral, if, you, can, point, out, only, a, few, scattered, blemishes, on, an, otherwise, immaculate, surface, if, no, one, can, accuse, me, of, greed, or, of, prurience, or, of, profligacy, if, i, live, a, virtuous, life, free, of, defilement, pardon, for, a, moment, my, self, praise, and, if, i, am, to, my, friends, a, good, friend, my, father, deserves, all, the, credit, as, it, is, now, he, deserves, from, me, unstinting, gratitude, and, praise, i, could, never, be, ashamed, of, such, a, father, nor, do, i, feel, any, need, as, many, people, do, to, apologize, for, being, a, freedman, s, son, satires, 1, 6, 65, 92, he, never, mentioned, his, mother, in, his, verses, and, he, might, not, have, known, much, about, her, perhaps, she, also, had, been, a, slave, horace, left, rome, possibly, after, his, father, s, death, and, continued, his, formal, education, in, athens, a, great, centre, of, learning, in, the, ancient, world, where, he, arrived, at, nineteen, years, of, age, enrolling, in, the, academy, founded, by, plato, the, academy, was, now, dominated, by, epicureans, and, stoics, whose, theories, and, practises, made, a, deep, impression, on, the, young, man, from, venusia, meanwhile, he, mixed, and, lounged, about, with, the, elite, of, roman, youth, such, as, marcus, the, idle, son, of, cicero, and, the, pompeius, to, whom, he, later, addressed, a, poem, it, was, in, athens, too, that, he, probably, acquired, deep, familiarity, with, the, ancient, tradition, of, greek, lyric, poetry, at, that, time, largely, the, preserve, of, grammarians, and, academic, specialists, access, to, such, material, was, easier, in, athens, than, in, rome, where, the, public, libraries, had, yet, to, be, built, by, asinius, pollio, and, augustus, rome, s, troubles, following, the, assassination, of, julius, caesar, were, soon, to, catch, up, with, him, marcus, junius, brutus, came, to, athens, seeking, support, for, the, republican, cause, brutus, was, f, ted, around, town, in, grand, receptions, and, he, made, a, point, of, attending, academic, lectures, all, the, while, recruiting, supporters, among, the, young, men, studying, there, including, horace, an, educated, young, roman, could, begin, military, service, high, in, the, ranks, and, horace, was, made, tribunus, militum, one, of, six, senior, officers, of, a, typical, legion, a, post, usually, reserved, for, men, of, senatorial, or, equestrian, rank, and, which, seems, to, have, inspired, jealousy, among, his, well, born, confederates, he, learned, the, basics, of, military, life, while, on, the, march, particularly, in, the, wilds, of, northern, greece, whose, rugged, scenery, became, a, backdrop, to, some, of, his, later, poems, it, was, there, in, 42, bc, that, octavian, later, augustus, and, his, associate, mark, antony, crushed, the, republican, forces, at, the, battle, of, philippi, horace, later, recorded, it, as, a, day, of, embarrassment, for, himself, when, he, fled, without, his, shield, but, allowance, should, be, made, for, his, self, deprecating, humour, moreover, the, incident, allowed, him, to, identify, himself, with, some, famous, poets, who, had, long, ago, abandoned, their, shields, in, battle, notably, his, heroes, alcaeus, and, archilochus, the, comparison, with, the, latter, poet, is, uncanny, archilochus, lost, his, shield, in, a, part, of, thrace, near, philippi, and, he, was, deeply, involved, in, the, greek, colonization, of, thasos, where, horace, s, die, hard, comrades, finally, surrendered, octavian, offered, an, early, amnesty, to, his, opponents, and, horace, quickly, accepted, it, on, returning, to, italy, he, was, confronted, with, yet, another, loss, his, father, s, estate, in, venusia, was, one, of, many, throughout, italy, to, be, confiscated, for, the, settlement, of, veterans, virgil, lost, his, estate, in, the, north, about, the, same, time, horace, later, claimed, that, he, was, reduced, to, poverty, and, this, led, him, to, try, his, hand, at, poetry, in, reality, there, was, no, money, to, be, had, from, versifying, at, best, it, offered, future, prospects, through, contacts, with, other, poets, and, their, patrons, among, the, rich, meanwhile, he, obtained, the, sinecure, of, scriba, quaestorius, a, civil, service, position, at, the, aerarium, or, treasury, profitable, enough, to, be, purchased, even, by, members, of, the, ordo, equester, and, not, very, demanding, in, its, work, load, since, tasks, could, be, delegated, to, scribae, or, permanent, clerks, it, was, about, this, time, that, he, began, writing, his, satires, and, epodes, he, describes, in, glowing, terms, the, country, villa, which, his, patron, maecenas, had, given, him, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, quintius, it, lies, on, a, range, of, hills, broken, by, a, shady, valley, which, is, so, placed, that, the, sun, when, rising, strikes, the, right, side, and, when, descending, in, his, flying, chariot, warms, the, left, you, would, like, the, climate, and, if, you, were, to, see, my, fruit, trees, bearing, ruddy, cornils, and, plums, my, oaks, and, ilex, supplying, food, to, my, herds, and, abundant, shade, to, the, master, you, would, say, tarentum, in, its, beauty, has, been, brought, near, to, rome, there, is, a, fountain, too, large, enough, to, give, a, name, to, the, river, which, it, feeds, and, the, ebro, itself, does, not, flow, through, thrace, with, cooler, or, purer, stream, its, waters, also, are, good, for, the, head, and, useful, for, digestion, this, sweet, and, if, you, will, believe, me, charming, retreat, keeps, me, in, good, health, during, the, autumnal, days, the, remains, of, horace, s, villa, are, situated, on, a, wooded, hillside, above, the, river, at, licenza, which, joins, the, aniene, as, it, flows, on, to, tivoli, the, epodes, belong, to, iambic, poetry, iambic, poetry, features, insulting, and, obscene, language, sometimes, it, is, referred, to, as, blame, poetry, blame, poetry, or, shame, poetry, is, poetry, written, to, blame, and, shame, fellow, citizens, into, a, sense, of, their, social, obligations, each, poem, normally, has, a, archetype, person, horace, decides, to, shame, or, teach, a, lesson, to, horace, modelled, these, poems, on, the, poetry, of, archilochus, social, bonds, in, rome, had, been, decaying, since, the, destruction, of, carthage, a, little, more, than, a, hundred, years, earlier, due, to, the, vast, wealth, that, could, be, gained, by, plunder, and, corruption, these, social, ills, were, magnified, by, rivalry, between, julius, caesar, mark, antony, and, confederates, like, sextus, pompey, all, jockeying, for, a, bigger, share, of, the, spoils, one, modern, scholar, has, counted, a, dozen, civil, wars, in, the, hundred, years, leading, up, to, 31, bc, including, the, third, servile, war, under, spartacus, eight, years, before, horace, s, birth, as, the, heirs, to, hellenistic, culture, horace, and, his, fellow, romans, were, not, well, prepared, to, deal, with, these, problems, at, bottom, all, the, problems, that, the, times, were, stirring, up, were, of, a, social, nature, which, the, hellenistic, thinkers, were, ill, qualified, to, grapple, with, some, of, them, censured, oppression, of, the, poor, by, the, rich, but, they, gave, no, practical, lead, though, they, may, have, hoped, to, see, well, meaning, rulers, doing, so, philosophy, was, drifting, into, absorption, in, self, a, quest, for, private, contentedness, to, be, achieved, by, self, control, and, restraint, without, much, regard, for, the, fate, of, a, disintegrating, community, horace, s, hellenistic, background, is, clear, in, his, satires, even, though, the, genre, was, unique, to, latin, literature, he, brought, to, it, a, style, and, outlook, suited, to, the, social, and, ethical, issues, confronting, rome, but, he, changed, its, role, from, public, social, engagement, to, private, meditation, meanwhile, he, was, beginning, to, interest, octavian, s, supporters, a, gradual, process, described, by, him, in, one, of, his, satires, the, way, was, opened, for, him, by, his, friend, the, poet, virgil, who, had, gained, admission, into, the, privileged, circle, around, maecenas, octavian, s, lieutenant, following, the, success, of, his, eclogues, an, introduction, soon, followed, and, after, a, discreet, interval, horace, too, was, accepted, he, depicted, the, process, as, an, honourable, one, based, on, merit, and, mutual, respect, eventually, leading, to, true, friendship, and, there, is, reason, to, believe, that, his, relationship, was, genuinely, friendly, not, just, with, maecenas, but, afterwards, with, augustus, as, well, on, the, other, hand, the, poet, has, been, unsympathetically, described, by, one, scholar, as, a, sharp, and, rising, young, man, with, an, eye, to, the, main, chance, there, were, advantages, on, both, sides, horace, gained, encouragement, and, material, support, the, politicians, gained, a, hold, on, a, potential, dissident, his, republican, sympathies, and, his, role, at, philippi, may, have, caused, him, some, pangs, of, remorse, over, his, new, status, however, most, romans, considered, the, civil, wars, to, be, the, result, of, contentio, dignitatis, or, rivalry, between, the, foremost, families, of, the, city, and, he, too, seems, to, have, accepted, the, principate, as, rome, s, last, hope, for, much, needed, peace, in, 37, bc, horace, accompanied, maecenas, on, a, journey, to, brundisium, described, in, one, of, his, poems, as, a, series, of, amusing, incidents, and, charming, encounters, with, other, friends, along, the, way, such, as, virgil, in, fact, the, journey, was, political, in, its, motivation, with, maecenas, en, route, to, negotiate, the, treaty, of, tarentum, with, antony, a, fact, horace, artfully, keeps, from, the, reader, political, issues, are, largely, avoided, in, the, first, book, of, satires, horace, was, probably, also, with, maecenas, on, one, of, octavian, s, naval, expeditions, against, the, piratical, sextus, pompeius, which, ended, in, a, disastrous, storm, off, palinurus, in, 36, bc, briefly, alluded, to, by, horace, in, terms, of, near, drowning, there, are, also, some, indications, in, his, verses, that, he, was, with, maecenas, at, the, battle, of, actium, in, 31, bc, where, octavian, defeated, his, great, rival, antony, by, then, horace, had, already, received, from, maecenas, the, famous, gift, of, his, sabine, farm, probably, not, long, after, the, publication, of, the, first, book, of, satires, the, gift, which, included, income, from, five, tenants, may, have, ended, his, career, at, the, treasury, or, at, least, allowed, him, to, give, it, less, time, and, energy, it, signalled, his, identification, with, the, octavian, regime, yet, in, the, second, book, of, satires, that, soon, followed, he, continued, the, apolitical, stance, of, the, first, book, by, this, time, he, had, attained, the, status, of, eques, romanus, roman, cavalryman, knight, perhaps, as, a, result, of, his, work, at, the, treasury, odes, 1, 3, were, the, next, focus, for, his, artistic, creativity, he, adapted, their, forms, and, themes, from, greek, lyric, poetry, of, the, seventh, and, sixth, centuries, bc, the, fragmented, nature, of, the, greek, world, had, enabled, his, literary, heroes, to, express, themselves, freely, and, his, semi, retirement, from, the, treasury, in, rome, to, his, own, estate, in, the, sabine, hills, perhaps, empowered, him, to, some, extent, also, yet, even, when, his, lyrics, touched, on, public, affairs, they, reinforced, the, importance, of, private, life, nevertheless, his, work, in, the, period, 30, 27, bc, began, to, show, his, closeness, to, the, regime, and, his, sensitivity, to, its, developing, ideology, in, odes, 1, 2, for, example, he, eulogized, octavian, in, hyperboles, that, echo, hellenistic, court, poetry, the, name, augustus, which, octavian, assumed, in, 27, january, bc, is, first, attested, in, odes, 3, 3, and, 3, 5, in, the, period, 27, 24, bc, political, allusions, in, the, odes, concentrated, on, foreign, wars, in, britain, 1, 35, arabia, 1, 29, hispania, 3, 8, and, parthia, 2, 2, he, greeted, augustus, on, his, return, to, rome, in, 24, bc, as, a, beloved, ruler, upon, whose, good, health, he, depended, for, his, own, happiness, 3, 14, the, public, reception, of, odes, 1, 3, disappointed, him, however, he, attributed, the, lack, of, success, to, jealousy, among, imperial, courtiers, and, to, his, isolation, from, literary, cliques, perhaps, it, was, disappointment, that, led, him, to, put, aside, the, genre, in, favour, of, verse, letters, he, addressed, his, first, book, of, epistles, to, a, variety, of, friends, and, acquaintances, in, an, urbane, style, reflecting, his, new, social, status, as, a, knight, in, the, opening, poem, he, professed, a, deeper, interest, in, moral, philosophy, than, poetry, but, though, the, collection, demonstrates, a, leaning, towards, stoic, theory, it, reveals, no, sustained, thinking, about, ethics, maecenas, was, still, the, dominant, confidante, but, horace, had, now, begun, to, assert, his, own, independence, suavely, declining, constant, invitations, to, attend, his, patron, in, the, final, poem, of, the, first, book, of, epistles, he, revealed, himself, to, be, forty, four, years, old, in, the, consulship, of, lollius, and, lepidus, i, e, 21, bc, and, of, small, stature, fond, of, the, sun, prematurely, grey, quick, tempered, but, easily, placated, according, to, suetonius, the, second, book, of, epistles, was, prompted, by, augustus, who, desired, a, verse, epistle, to, be, addressed, to, himself, augustus, was, in, fact, a, prolific, letter, writer, and, he, once, asked, horace, to, be, his, personal, secretary, horace, refused, the, secretarial, role, but, complied, with, the, emperor, s, request, for, a, verse, letter, the, letter, to, augustus, may, have, been, slow, in, coming, being, published, possibly, as, late, as, 11, bc, it, celebrated, among, other, things, the, 15, bc, military, victories, of, his, stepsons, drusus, and, tiberius, yet, it, and, the, following, letter, were, largely, devoted, to, literary, theory, and, criticism, the, literary, theme, was, explored, still, further, in, ars, poetica, published, separately, but, written, in, the, form, of, an, epistle, and, sometimes, referred, to, as, epistles, 2, 3, possibly, the, last, poem, he, ever, wrote, he, was, also, commissioned, to, write, odes, commemorating, the, victories, of, drusus, and, tiberius, and, one, to, be, sung, in, a, temple, of, apollo, for, the, secular, games, a, long, abandoned, festival, that, augustus, revived, in, accordance, with, his, policy, of, recreating, ancient, customs, carmen, saeculare, suetonius, recorded, some, gossip, about, horace, s, sexual, activities, late, in, life, claiming, that, the, walls, of, his, bedchamber, were, covered, with, obscene, pictures, and, mirrors, so, that, he, saw, erotica, wherever, he, looked, the, poet, died, at, 56, years, of, age, not, long, after, his, friend, maecenas, near, whose, tomb, he, was, laid, to, rest, both, men, bequeathed, their, property, to, augustus, an, honour, that, the, emperor, expected, of, his, friends, the, dating, of, horace, s, works, isn, t, known, precisely, and, scholars, often, debate, the, exact, order, in, which, they, were, first, published, there, are, persuasive, arguments, for, the, following, chronology, horace, composed, in, traditional, metres, borrowed, from, archaic, greece, employing, hexameters, in, his, satires, and, epistles, and, iambs, in, his, epodes, all, of, which, were, relatively, easy, to, adapt, into, latin, forms, his, odes, featured, more, complex, measures, including, alcaics, and, sapphics, which, were, sometimes, a, difficult, fit, for, latin, structure, and, syntax, despite, these, traditional, metres, he, presented, himself, as, a, partisan, in, the, development, of, a, new, and, sophisticated, style, he, was, influenced, in, particular, by, hellenistic, aesthetics, of, brevity, elegance, and, polish, as, modelled, in, the, work, of, callimachus, as, soon, as, horace, stirred, by, his, own, genius, and, encouraged, by, the, example, of, virgil, varius, and, perhaps, some, other, poets, of, the, same, generation, had, determined, to, make, his, fame, as, a, poet, being, by, temperament, a, fighter, he, wanted, to, fight, against, all, kinds, of, prejudice, amateurish, slovenliness, philistinism, reactionary, tendencies, in, short, to, fight, for, the, new, and, noble, type, of, poetry, which, he, and, his, friends, were, endeavouring, to, bring, about, in, modern, literary, theory, a, distinction, is, often, made, between, immediate, personal, experience, urerlebnis, and, experience, mediated, by, cultural, vectors, such, as, literature, philosophy, and, the, visual, arts, bildungserlebnis, the, distinction, has, little, relevance, for, horace, however, since, his, personal, and, literary, experiences, are, implicated, in, each, other, satires, 1, 5, for, example, recounts, in, detail, a, real, trip, horace, made, with, virgil, and, some, of, his, other, literary, friends, and, which, parallels, a, satire, by, lucilius, his, predecessor, unlike, much, hellenistic, inspired, literature, however, his, poetry, was, not, composed, for, a, small, coterie, of, admirers, and, fellow, poets, nor, does, it, rely, on, abstruse, allusions, for, many, of, its, effects, though, elitist, in, its, literary, standards, it, was, written, for, a, wide, audience, as, a, public, form, of, art, ambivalence, also, characterizes, his, literary, persona, since, his, presentation, of, himself, as, part, of, a, small, community, of, philosophically, aware, people, seeking, true, peace, of, mind, while, shunning, vices, like, greed, was, well, adapted, to, augustus, s, plans, to, reform, public, morality, corrupted, by, greed, his, personal, plea, for, moderation, was, part, of, the, emperor, s, grand, message, to, the, nation, horace, generally, followed, the, examples, of, poets, established, as, classics, in, different, genres, such, as, archilochus, in, the, epodes, lucilius, in, the, satires, and, alcaeus, in, the, odes, later, broadening, his, scope, for, the, sake, of, variation, and, because, his, models, weren, t, actually, suited, to, the, realities, confronting, him, archilochus, and, alcaeus, were, aristocratic, greeks, whose, poetry, had, a, social, and, religious, function, that, was, immediately, intelligible, to, their, audiences, but, which, became, a, mere, artifice, or, literary, motif, when, transposed, to, rome, however, the, artifice, of, the, odes, is, also, integral, to, their, success, since, they, could, now, accommodate, a, wide, range, of, emotional, effects, and, the, blend, of, greek, and, roman, elements, adds, a, sense, of, detachment, and, universality, horace, proudly, claimed, to, introduce, into, latin, the, spirit, and, iambic, poetry, of, archilochus, but, unlike, archilochus, without, persecuting, anyone, epistles, 1, 19, 23, 25, it, was, no, idle, boast, his, epodes, were, modelled, on, the, verses, of, the, greek, poet, as, blame, poetry, yet, he, avoided, targeting, real, scapegoats, whereas, archilochus, presented, himself, as, a, serious, and, vigorous, opponent, of, wrong, doers, horace, aimed, for, comic, effects, and, adopted, the, persona, of, a, weak, and, ineffectual, critic, of, his, times, as, symbolized, for, example, in, his, surrender, to, the, witch, canidia, in, the, final, epode, he, also, claimed, to, be, the, first, to, introduce, into, latin, the, lyrical, methods, of, alcaeus, epistles, 1, 19, 32, 33, and, he, actually, was, the, first, latin, poet, to, make, consistent, use, of, alcaic, meters, and, themes, love, politics, and, the, symposium, he, imitated, other, greek, lyric, poets, as, well, employing, a, motto, technique, beginning, each, ode, with, some, reference, to, a, greek, original, and, then, diverging, from, it, the, satirical, poet, lucilius, was, a, senator, s, son, who, could, castigate, his, peers, with, impunity, horace, was, a, mere, freedman, s, son, who, had, to, tread, carefully, lucilius, was, a, rugged, patriot, and, a, significant, voice, in, roman, self, awareness, endearing, himself, to, his, countrymen, by, his, blunt, frankness, and, explicit, politics, his, work, expressed, genuine, freedom, or, libertas, his, style, included, metrical, vandalism, and, looseness, of, structure, horace, instead, adopted, an, oblique, and, ironic, style, of, satire, ridiculing, stock, characters, and, anonymous, targets, his, libertas, was, the, private, freedom, of, a, philosophical, outlook, not, a, political, or, social, privilege, his, satires, are, relatively, easy, going, in, their, use, of, meter, relative, to, the, tight, lyric, meters, of, the, odes, but, formal, and, highly, controlled, relative, to, the, poems, of, lucilius, whom, horace, mocked, for, his, sloppy, standards, satires, 1, 10, 56, 61, the, epistles, may, be, considered, among, horace, s, most, innovative, works, there, was, nothing, like, it, in, greek, or, roman, literature, occasionally, poems, had, had, some, resemblance, to, letters, including, an, elegiac, poem, from, solon, to, mimnermus, and, some, lyrical, poems, from, pindar, to, hieron, of, syracuse, lucilius, had, composed, a, satire, in, the, form, of, a, letter, and, some, epistolary, poems, were, composed, by, catullus, and, propertius, but, nobody, before, horace, had, ever, composed, an, entire, collection, of, verse, letters, let, alone, letters, with, a, focus, on, philosophical, problems, the, sophisticated, and, flexible, style, that, he, had, developed, in, his, satires, was, adapted, to, the, more, serious, needs, of, this, new, genre, such, refinement, of, style, was, not, unusual, for, horace, his, craftsmanship, as, a, wordsmith, is, apparent, even, in, his, earliest, attempts, at, this, or, that, kind, of, poetry, but, his, handling, of, each, genre, tended, to, improve, over, time, as, he, adapted, it, to, his, own, needs, thus, for, example, it, is, generally, agreed, that, his, second, book, of, satires, where, human, folly, is, revealed, through, dialogue, between, characters, is, superior, to, the, first, where, he, propounds, his, ethics, in, monologues, nevertheless, the, first, book, includes, some, of, his, most, popular, poems, horace, developed, a, number, of, inter, related, themes, throughout, his, poetic, career, including, politics, love, philosophy, and, ethics, his, own, social, role, as, well, as, poetry, itself, his, epodes, and, satires, are, forms, of, blame, poetry, and, both, have, a, natural, affinity, with, the, moralising, and, diatribes, of, cynicism, this, often, takes, the, form, of, allusions, to, the, work, and, philosophy, of, bion, of, borysthenes, but, it, is, as, much, a, literary, game, as, a, philosophical, alignment, by, the, time, he, composed, his, epistles, he, was, a, critic, of, cynicism, along, with, all, impractical, and, high, falutin, philosophy, in, general, the, satires, also, include, a, strong, element, of, epicureanism, with, frequent, allusions, to, the, epicurean, poet, lucretius, so, for, example, the, epicurean, sentiment, carpe, diem, is, the, inspiration, behind, horace, s, repeated, punning, on, his, own, name, horatius, hora, in, satires, 2, 6, the, satires, also, feature, some, stoic, peripatetic, and, platonic, dialogues, elements, in, short, the, satires, present, a, medley, of, philosophical, programmes, dished, up, in, no, particular, order, a, style, of, argument, typical, of, the, genre, the, odes, display, a, wide, range, of, topics, over, time, he, becomes, more, confident, about, his, political, voice, although, he, is, often, thought, of, as, an, overly, intellectual, lover, he, is, ingenious, in, representing, passion, the, odes, weave, various, philosophical, strands, together, with, allusions, and, statements, of, doctrine, present, in, about, a, third, of, the, odes, books, 1, 3, ranging, from, the, flippant, 1, 22, 3, 28, to, the, solemn, 2, 10, 3, 2, 3, 3, epicureanism, is, the, dominant, influence, characterising, about, twice, as, many, of, these, odes, as, stoicism, a, group, of, odes, combines, these, two, influences, in, tense, relationships, such, as, odes, 1, 7, praising, stoic, virility, and, devotion, to, public, duty, while, also, advocating, private, pleasures, among, friends, while, generally, favouring, the, epicurean, lifestyle, the, lyric, poet, is, as, eclectic, as, the, satiric, poet, and, in, odes, 2, 10, even, proposes, aristotle, s, golden, mean, as, a, remedy, for, rome, s, political, troubles, many, of, horace, s, poems, also, contain, much, reflection, on, genre, the, lyric, tradition, and, the, function, of, poetry, odes, 4, thought, to, be, composed, at, the, emperor, s, request, takes, the, themes, of, the, first, three, books, of, odes, to, a, new, level, this, book, shows, greater, poetic, confidence, after, the, public, performance, of, his, carmen, saeculare, or, century, hymn, at, a, public, festival, orchestrated, by, augustus, in, it, horace, addresses, the, emperor, augustus, directly, with, more, confidence, and, proclaims, his, power, to, grant, poetic, immortality, to, those, he, praises, it, is, the, least, philosophical, collection, of, his, verses, excepting, the, twelfth, ode, addressed, to, the, dead, virgil, as, if, he, were, living, in, that, ode, the, epic, poet, and, the, lyric, poet, are, aligned, with, stoicism, and, epicureanism, respectively, in, a, mood, of, bitter, sweet, pathos, the, first, poem, of, the, epistles, sets, the, philosophical, tone, for, the, rest, of, the, collection, so, now, i, put, aside, both, verses, and, all, those, other, games, what, is, true, and, what, befits, is, my, care, this, my, question, this, my, whole, concern, his, poetic, renunciation, of, poetry, in, favour, of, philosophy, is, intended, to, be, ambiguous, ambiguity, is, the, hallmark, of, the, epistles, it, is, uncertain, if, those, being, addressed, by, the, self, mocking, poet, philosopher, are, being, honoured, or, criticised, though, he, emerges, as, an, epicurean, it, is, on, the, understanding, that, philosophical, preferences, like, political, and, social, choices, are, a, matter, of, personal, taste, thus, he, depicts, the, ups, and, downs, of, the, philosophical, life, more, realistically, than, do, most, philosophers, the, reception, of, horace, s, work, has, varied, from, one, epoch, to, another, and, varied, markedly, even, in, his, own, lifetime, odes, 1, 3, were, not, well, received, when, first, published, in, rome, yet, augustus, later, commissioned, a, ceremonial, ode, for, the, centennial, games, in, 17, bc, and, also, encouraged, the, publication, of, odes, 4, after, which, horace, s, reputation, as, rome, s, premier, lyricist, was, assured, his, odes, were, to, become, the, best, received, of, all, his, poems, in, ancient, times, acquiring, a, classic, status, that, discouraged, imitation, no, other, poet, produced, a, comparable, body, of, lyrics, in, the, four, centuries, that, followed, though, that, might, also, be, attributed, to, social, causes, particularly, the, parasitism, that, italy, was, sinking, into, in, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, ode, writing, became, highly, fashionable, in, england, and, a, large, number, of, aspiring, poets, imitated, horace, both, in, english, and, in, latin, in, a, verse, epistle, to, augustus, epistle, 2, 1, in, 12, bc, horace, argued, for, classic, status, to, be, awarded, to, contemporary, poets, including, virgil, and, apparently, himself, in, the, final, poem, of, his, third, book, of, odes, he, claimed, to, have, created, for, himself, a, monument, more, durable, than, bronze, exegi, monumentum, aere, perennius, carmina, 3, 30, 1, for, one, modern, scholar, however, horace, s, personal, qualities, are, more, notable, than, the, monumental, quality, of, his, achievement, when, we, hear, his, name, we, don, t, really, think, of, a, monument, we, think, rather, of, a, voice, which, varies, in, tone, and, resonance, but, is, always, recognizable, and, which, by, its, unsentimental, humanity, evokes, a, very, special, blend, of, liking, and, respect, yet, for, men, like, wilfred, owen, scarred, by, experiences, of, world, war, i, his, poetry, stood, for, discredited, values, my, friend, you, would, not, tell, with, such, high, zest, to, children, ardent, for, some, desperate, glory, the, old, lie, dulce, et, decorum, est, pro, patria, mori, the, same, motto, dulce, et, decorum, est, pro, patria, mori, had, been, adapted, to, the, ethos, of, martyrdom, in, the, lyrics, of, early, christian, poets, like, prudentius, these, preliminary, comments, touch, on, a, small, sample, of, developments, in, the, reception, of, horace, s, work, more, developments, are, covered, epoch, by, epoch, in, the, following, sections, horace, s, influence, can, be, observed, in, the, work, of, his, near, contemporaries, ovid, and, propertius, ovid, followed, his, example, in, creating, a, completely, natural, style, of, expression, in, hexameter, verse, and, propertius, cheekily, mimicked, him, in, his, third, book, of, elegies, his, epistles, provided, them, both, with, a, model, for, their, own, verse, letters, and, it, also, shaped, ovid, s, exile, poetry, his, influence, had, a, perverse, aspect, as, mentioned, before, the, brilliance, of, his, odes, may, have, discouraged, imitation, conversely, they, may, have, created, a, vogue, for, the, lyrics, of, the, archaic, greek, poet, pindar, due, to, the, fact, that, horace, had, neglected, that, style, of, lyric, see, influence, and, legacy, of, pindar, the, iambic, genre, seems, almost, to, have, disappeared, after, publication, of, horace, s, epodes, ovid, s, ibis, was, a, rare, attempt, at, the, form, but, it, was, inspired, mainly, by, callimachus, and, there, are, some, iambic, elements, in, martial, but, the, main, influence, there, was, catullus, a, revival, of, popular, interest, in, the, satires, of, lucilius, may, have, been, inspired, by, horace, s, criticism, of, his, unpolished, style, both, horace, and, lucilius, were, considered, good, role, models, by, persius, who, critiqued, his, own, satires, as, lacking, both, the, acerbity, of, lucillius, and, the, gentler, touch, of, horace, juvenal, s, caustic, satire, was, influenced, mainly, by, lucilius, but, horace, by, then, was, a, school, classic, and, juvenal, could, refer, to, him, respectfully, and, in, a, round, about, way, as, the, venusine, lamp, statius, paid, homage, to, horace, by, composing, one, poem, in, sapphic, and, one, in, alcaic, meter, the, verse, forms, most, often, associated, with, odes, which, he, included, in, his, collection, of, occasional, poems, silvae, ancient, scholars, wrote, commentaries, on, the, lyric, meters, of, the, odes, including, the, scholarly, poet, caesius, bassus, by, a, process, called, derivatio, he, varied, established, meters, through, the, addition, or, omission, of, syllables, a, technique, borrowed, by, seneca, the, younger, when, adapting, horatian, meters, to, the, stage, horace, s, poems, continued, to, be, school, texts, into, late, antiquity, works, attributed, to, helenius, acro, and, pomponius, porphyrio, are, the, remnants, of, a, much, larger, body, of, horatian, scholarship, porphyrio, arranged, the, poems, in, non, chronological, order, beginning, with, the, odes, because, of, their, general, popularity, and, their, appeal, to, scholars, the, odes, were, to, retain, this, privileged, position, in, the, medieval, manuscript, tradition, and, thus, in, modern, editions, also, horace, was, often, evoked, by, poets, of, the, fourth, century, such, as, ausonius, and, claudian, prudentius, presented, himself, as, a, christian, horace, adapting, horatian, meters, to, his, own, poetry, and, giving, horatian, motifs, a, christian, tone, on, the, other, hand, st, jerome, modelled, an, uncompromising, response, to, the, pagan, horace, observing, what, harmony, can, there, be, between, christ, and, the, devil, what, has, horace, to, do, with, the, psalter, by, the, early, sixth, century, horace, and, prudentius, were, both, part, of, a, classical, heritage, that, was, struggling, to, survive, the, disorder, of, the, times, boethius, the, last, major, author, of, classical, latin, literature, could, still, take, inspiration, from, horace, sometimes, mediated, by, senecan, tragedy, it, can, be, argued, that, horace, s, influence, extended, beyond, poetry, to, dignify, core, themes, and, values, of, the, early, christian, era, such, as, self, sufficiency, inner, contentment, and, courage, classical, texts, almost, ceased, being, copied, in, the, period, between, the, mid, sixth, century, and, the, carolingian, revival, horace, s, work, probably, survived, in, just, two, or, three, books, imported, into, northern, europe, from, italy, these, became, the, ancestors, of, six, extant, manuscripts, dated, to, the, ninth, century, two, of, those, six, manuscripts, are, french, in, origin, one, was, produced, in, alsace, and, the, other, three, show, irish, influence, but, were, probably, written, in, continental, monasteries, lombardy, for, example, by, the, last, half, of, the, ninth, century, it, was, not, uncommon, for, literate, people, to, have, direct, experience, of, horace, s, poetry, his, influence, on, the, carolingian, renaissance, can, be, found, in, the, poems, of, heiric, of, auxerre, and, in, some, manuscripts, marked, with, neumes, mysterious, notations, that, may, have, been, an, aid, to, the, memorization, and, discussion, of, his, lyric, meters, ode, 4, 11, is, neumed, with, the, melody, of, a, hymn, to, john, the, baptist, ut, queant, laxis, composed, in, sapphic, stanzas, this, hymn, later, became, the, basis, of, the, solfege, system, do, re, mi, an, association, with, western, music, quite, appropriate, for, a, lyric, poet, like, horace, though, the, language, of, the, hymn, is, mainly, prudentian, lyons, argues, that, the, melody, in, question, was, linked, with, horace, s, ode, well, before, guido, d, arezzo, fitted, ut, queant, laxis, to, it, however, the, melody, is, unlikely, to, be, a, survivor, from, classical, times, although, ovid, testifies, to, horace, s, use, of, the, lyre, while, performing, his, odes, the, german, scholar, ludwig, traube, once, dubbed, the, tenth, and, eleventh, centuries, the, age, of, horace, aetas, horatiana, and, placed, it, between, the, aetas, vergiliana, of, the, eighth, and, ninth, centuries, and, the, aetas, ovidiana, of, the, twelfth, and, thirteenth, centuries, a, distinction, supposed, to, reflect, the, dominant, classical, latin, influences, of, those, times, such, a, distinction, is, over, schematized, since, horace, was, a, substantial, influence, in, the, ninth, century, as, well, traube, had, focused, too, much, on, horace, s, satires, almost, all, of, horace, s, work, found, favour, in, the, medieval, period, in, fact, medieval, scholars, were, also, guilty, of, over, schematism, associating, horace, s, different, genres, with, the, different, ages, of, man, a, twelfth, century, scholar, encapsulated, the, theory, horace, wrote, four, different, kinds, of, poems, on, account, of, the, four, ages, the, odes, for, boys, the, ars, poetica, for, young, men, the, satires, for, mature, men, the, epistles, for, old, and, complete, men, it, was, even, thought, that, horace, had, composed, his, works, in, the, order, in, which, they, had, been, placed, by, ancient, scholars, despite, its, naivety, the, schematism, involved, an, appreciation, of, horace, s, works, as, a, collection, the, ars, poetica, satires, and, epistles, appearing, to, find, favour, as, well, as, the, odes, the, later, middle, ages, however, gave, special, significance, to, satires, and, epistles, being, considered, horace, s, mature, works, dante, referred, to, horace, as, orazio, satiro, and, he, awarded, him, a, privileged, position, in, the, first, circle, of, hell, with, homer, ovid, and, lucan, horace, s, popularity, is, revealed, in, the, large, number, of, quotes, from, all, his, works, found, in, almost, every, genre, of, medieval, literature, and, also, in, the, number, of, poets, imitating, him, in, quantitative, latin, meter, the, most, prolific, imitator, of, his, odes, was, the, bavarian, monk, metellus, of, tegernsee, who, dedicated, his, work, to, the, patron, saint, of, tegernsee, abbey, st, quirinus, around, the, year, 1170, he, imitated, all, horace, s, lyrical, meters, then, followed, these, up, with, imitations, of, other, meters, used, by, prudentius, and, boethius, indicating, that, variety, as, first, modelled, by, horace, was, considered, a, fundamental, aspect, of, the, lyric, genre, the, content, of, his, poems, however, was, restricted, to, simple, piety, among, the, most, successful, imitators, of, satires, and, epistles, was, another, germanic, author, calling, himself, sextus, amarcius, around, 1100, who, composed, four, books, the, first, two, exemplifying, vices, the, second, pair, mainly, virtues, petrarch, is, a, key, figure, in, the, imitation, of, horace, in, accentual, meters, his, verse, letters, in, latin, were, modelled, on, the, epistles, and, he, wrote, a, letter, to, horace, in, the, form, of, an, ode, however, he, also, borrowed, from, horace, when, composing, his, italian, sonnets, one, modern, scholar, has, speculated, that, authors, who, imitated, horace, in, accentual, rhythms, including, stressed, latin, and, vernacular, languages, may, have, considered, their, work, a, natural, sequel, to, horace, s, metrical, variety, in, france, horace, and, pindar, were, the, poetic, models, for, a, group, of, vernacular, authors, called, the, pl, iade, including, for, example, pierre, de, ronsard, and, joachim, du, bellay, montaigne, made, constant, and, inventive, use, of, horatian, quotes, the, vernacular, languages, were, dominant, in, castilia, and, portugal, in, the, sixteenth, century, where, horace, s, influence, is, notable, in, the, works, of, such, authors, as, garcilaso, de, la, vega, juan, bosc, n, s, de, miranda, antonio, ferreira, and, fray, luis, de, le, n, the, last, writing, odes, on, the, horatian, theme, beatus, ille, happy, the, man, the, sixteenth, century, in, western, europe, was, also, an, age, of, translations, except, in, germany, where, horace, wasn, t, translated, into, the, vernacular, until, well, into, the, seventeenth, century, the, first, english, translator, was, thomas, drant, who, placed, translations, of, jeremiah, and, horace, side, by, side, in, medicinable, morall, 1566, that, was, also, the, year, that, the, scot, george, buchanan, paraphrased, the, psalms, in, a, horatian, setting, ben, jonson, put, horace, on, the, stage, in, 1601, in, poetaster, along, with, other, classical, latin, authors, giving, them, all, their, own, verses, to, speak, in, translation, horace, s, part, evinces, the, independent, spirit, moral, earnestness, and, critical, insight, that, many, readers, look, for, in, his, poems, during, the, seventeenth, and, eighteenth, centuries, or, the, age, of, enlightenment, neoclassical, culture, was, pervasive, english, literature, in, the, middle, of, that, period, has, been, dubbed, augustan, it, is, not, always, easy, to, distinguish, horace, s, influence, during, those, centuries, the, mixing, of, influences, is, shown, for, example, in, one, poet, s, pseudonym, horace, juvenal, however, a, measure, of, his, influence, can, be, found, in, the, diversity, of, the, people, interested, in, his, works, both, among, readers, and, authors, new, editions, of, his, works, were, published, almost, yearly, there, were, three, new, editions, in, 1612, two, in, leiden, one, in, frankfurt, and, again, in, 1699, utrecht, barcelona, cambridge, cheap, editions, were, plentiful, and, fine, editions, were, also, produced, including, one, whose, entire, text, was, engraved, by, john, pine, in, copperplate, the, poet, james, thomson, owned, five, editions, of, horace, s, work, and, the, physician, james, douglas, had, five, hundred, books, with, horace, related, titles, horace, was, often, commended, in, periodicals, such, as, the, spectator, as, a, hallmark, of, good, judgement, moderation, and, manliness, a, focus, for, moralising, his, verses, offered, a, fund, of, mottoes, such, as, simplex, munditiis, elegance, in, simplicity, splendide, mendax, nobly, untruthful, sapere, aude, dare, to, know, nunc, est, bibendum, now, is, the, time, to, drink, carpe, diem, seize, the, day, perhaps, the, only, one, still, in, common, use, today, these, were, quoted, even, in, works, as, prosaic, as, edmund, quincy, s, a, treatise, of, hemp, husbandry, 1765, the, fictional, hero, tom, jones, recited, his, verses, with, feeling, his, works, were, also, used, to, justify, commonplace, themes, such, as, patriotic, obedience, as, in, james, parry, s, english, lines, from, an, oxford, university, collection, in, 1736, what, friendly, muse, will, teach, my, lays, to, emulate, the, roman, fire, justly, to, sound, a, caesar, s, praise, demands, a, bold, horatian, lyre, horatian, style, lyrics, were, increasingly, typical, of, oxford, and, cambridge, verse, collections, for, this, period, most, of, them, in, latin, but, some, like, the, previous, ode, in, english, john, milton, s, lycidas, first, appeared, in, such, a, collection, it, has, few, horatian, echoes, yet, milton, s, associations, with, horace, were, lifelong, he, composed, a, controversial, version, of, odes, 1, 5, and, paradise, lost, includes, references, to, horace, s, roman, odes, 3, 1, 6, book, 7, for, example, begins, with, echoes, of, odes, 3, 4, yet, horace, s, lyrics, could, offer, inspiration, to, libertines, as, well, as, moralists, and, neo, latin, sometimes, served, as, a, kind, of, discrete, veil, for, the, risqu, thus, for, example, benjamin, loveling, authored, a, catalogue, of, drury, lane, and, covent, garden, prostitutes, in, sapphic, stanzas, and, an, encomium, for, a, dying, lady, of, salacious, memory, some, latin, imitations, of, horace, were, politically, subversive, such, as, a, marriage, ode, by, anthony, alsop, that, included, a, rallying, cry, for, the, jacobite, cause, on, the, other, hand, andrew, marvell, took, inspiration, from, horace, s, odes, 1, 37, to, compose, his, english, masterpiece, horatian, ode, upon, cromwell, s, return, from, ireland, in, which, subtly, nuanced, reflections, on, the, execution, of, charles, i, echo, horace, s, ambiguous, response, to, the, death, of, cleopatra, marvell, s, ode, was, suppressed, in, spite, of, its, subtlety, and, only, began, to, be, widely, published, in, 1776, samuel, johnson, took, particular, pleasure, in, reading, the, odes, alexander, pope, wrote, direct, imitations, of, horace, published, with, the, original, latin, alongside, and, also, echoed, him, in, essays, and, the, rape, of, the, lock, he, even, emerged, as, a, quite, horatian, homer, in, his, translation, of, the, iliad, horace, appealed, also, to, female, poets, such, as, anna, seward, original, sonnets, on, various, subjects, and, odes, paraphrased, from, horace, 1799, and, elizabeth, tollet, who, composed, a, latin, ode, in, sapphic, meter, to, celebrate, her, brother, s, return, from, overseas, with, tea, and, coffee, substituted, for, the, wine, of, horace, s, sympotic, settings, quos, procax, nobis, numeros, jocosque, musa, dictaret, mihi, dum, tibique, temperent, baccis, arabes, vel, herbis, pocula, seres, what, verses, and, jokes, might, the, bold, muse, dictate, while, for, you, and, me, arabs, flavour, our, cups, with, beans, or, chinese, with, leaves, horace, s, ars, poetica, is, second, only, to, aristotle, s, poetics, in, its, influence, on, literary, theory, and, criticism, milton, recommended, both, works, in, his, treatise, of, education, horace, s, satires, and, epistles, however, also, had, a, huge, impact, influencing, theorists, and, critics, such, as, john, dryden, there, was, considerable, debate, over, the, value, of, different, lyrical, forms, for, contemporary, poets, as, represented, on, one, hand, by, the, kind, of, four, line, stanzas, made, familiar, by, horace, s, sapphic, and, alcaic, odes, and, on, the, other, the, loosely, structured, pindarics, associated, with, the, odes, of, pindar, translations, occasionally,
