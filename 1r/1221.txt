years, of, the, safavid, dynasty, which, had, ruled, iran, since, 1502, at, its, peak, under, such, figures, as, abbas, the, great, safavid, iran, had, been, a, powerful, empire, but, by, the, early, 18th, century, the, state, was, in, serious, decline, and, the, reigning, shah, soltan, hoseyn, was, a, weak, ruler, when, soltan, husayn, attempted, to, quell, a, rebellion, by, the, ghilzai, afghans, in, kandahar, the, governor, he, sent, gurgin, khan, was, killed, under, their, leader, mahmud, hotaki, the, rebellious, afghans, moved, westwards, against, the, shah, himself, and, in, 1722,

to, back, him, meanwhile, iran, s, imperial, neighboring, rivals, the, ottomans, and, the, russians, took, advantage, of, the, chaos, in, the, country, to, seize, and, divide, territory, for, themselves, in, 1722, russia, led, by, peter, the, great, and, further, aided, by, some, of, the, most, notable, caucasian, regents, of, the, disintegrating, safavid, empire, such, as, vakhtang, vi,

that, mainly, iranian, territories, in, georgia, iranian, azerbaijan, and, armenia, were, taken, by, the, ottomans, the, newly, gained, russian, and, turkish, possessions, were, confirmed, and, further, divided, amongst, themselves, in, the, treaty, of, constantinople, 1724, during, the, chaos, nader, cut, a, deal, with, mahmud, hotaki, to, rule, kalat, in, the, north, of, iran, however, when, mahmud, hotaki, began, minting, coins, in, his, name, and, asked, for, everyone, s, allegiance, nader, refused, tahmasp, and, the, qajar, leader, fath, ali, khan, the, ancestor, of, agha, mohammad, khan, qajar, contacted, nader, and, asked, him, to, join, their, cause, and, drive, the, ghilzai, afghans, out, of, khorasan, he, agreed, and, thus, became, a, figure, of, national, importance, when, nader, discovered, that, fath, ali, khan, was, in, treacherous, correspondence, with, malek, mahmud, and, revealed, this, to, the, shah, tahmasp, executed, him, and, made, nader, the, chief, of, his, army, instead, nader, subsequently, took, on, the, title, tahmasp, qoli, servant, of, tahmasp, in, late, 1726, nader, recaptured, mashhad, nader, chose, not, to, march, directly, on, isfahan, first, in, may, 1729, he, defeated, the, abdali, afghans, near, herat, many, of, the, abdali, afghans, subsequently, joined, his, army, the, new, shah, of, the, ghilzai, afghans, ashraf, decided, to, move, against, nader, but, in, september, 1729, nader, defeated, him, at, the, battle, of, damghan, and, again, decisively, in, november, at, murchakhort, ashraf, fled, and, nader, finally, entered, isfahan, handing, it, over, to, tahmasp, in, december, the, citizens, rejoicing, was, cut, short, when, nader, plundered, them, to, pay, his, army, tahmasp, made, nader, governor, over, many, eastern, provinces, including, his, native, khorasan, and, tahmasp, s, sister, was, given, in, marriage, to, nader, s, son, nader, pursued, and, defeated, ashraf, who, was, murdered, by, his, own, followers, in, 1738, nader, shah, besieged, and, destroyed, the, last, hotaki, seat, of, power, at, kandahar, he, built, a, new, city, near, kandahar, which, he, named, naderabad, in, the, spring, of, 1730, nader, attacked, iran, s, archrival, the, ottomans, and, regained, most, of, the, territory, lost, during, the, recent, chaos, at, the, same, time, the, abdali, afghans, rebelled, and, besieged, mashhad, forcing, nader, to, suspend, his, campaign, and, save, his, brother, ebrahim, it, took, nader, fourteen, months, to, crush, this, uprising, relations, between, nader, and, the, shah, had, declined, as, the, latter, grew, jealous, of, his, general, s, military, successes, while, nader, was, absent, in, the, east, tahmasp, tried, to, assert, himself, by, launching, a, foolhardy, campaign, to, recapture, yerevan, he, ended, up, losing, all, of, nader, s, recent, gains, to, the, ottomans, and, signed, a, treaty, ceding, georgia, and, armenia, in, exchange, for, tabriz, nader, furious, saw, that, the, moment, had, come, to, ease, tahmasp, from, power, he, denounced, the, treaty, seeking, popular, support, for, a, war, against, the, ottomans, in, isfahan, nader, got, tahmasp, drunk, then, showed, him, to, the, courtiers, asking, if, a, man, in, such, a, state, was, fit, to, rule, in, 1732, he, forced, tahmasp, to, abdicate, in, favour, of, the, shah, s, baby, son, abbas, iii, to, whom, nader, became, regent, nader, decided, as, he, continued, the, 1730, 1735, war, that, he, could, win, back, the, territory, in, armenia, and, georgia, by, seizing, ottoman, baghdad, and, then, offering, it, in, exchange, for, the, lost, provinces, but, his, plan, went, badly, amiss, when, his, army, was, routed, by, the, ottoman, general, topal, osman, pasha, near, the, city, in, 1733, the, soldiers, under, the, command, of, mohammad, khan, baloch, to, besiege, finally, after, hours, of, fighting, nader, s, troops, were, defeated, and, retreated, this, was, the, only, time, that, he, was, ever, defeated, in, battle, nader, decided, he, needed, to, regain, the, initiative, as, soon, as, possible, to, save, his, position, because, revolts, were, already, breaking, out, in, iran, he, faced, topal, again, with, a, larger, force, and, defeated, and, killed, him, he, then, besieged, baghdad, as, well, as, ganja, in, the, northern, provinces, earning, a, russian, alliance, against, the, ottomans, nader, scored, a, great, victory, over, a, superior, ottoman, force, at, baghavard, and, by, the, summer, of, 1735, iranian, armenia, and, georgia, were, his, again, in, march, 1735, he, signed, a, treaty, with, the, russians, in, ganja, by, which, the, latter, agreed, to, withdraw, all, of, their, troops, from, iranian, territory, those, which, had, not, been, ceded, back, by, the, 1732, treaty, of, resht, yet, resulting, in, the, reestablishment, of, iranian, rule, over, all, of, the, caucasus, and, northern, mainland, iran, again, nader, suggested, to, his, closest, intimates, after, a, great, hunting, party, on, the, moghan, plains, presently, split, between, azerbaijan, and, iran, that, he, should, be, proclaimed, the, new, king, shah, in, place, of, the, young, abbas, iii, the, small, group, of, close, intimates, nader, s, friends, included, tahmasp, khan, jalayer, and, hasan, ali, beg, bestami, following, nader, s, suggestion, the, group, did, not, demur, and, hasan, ali, remained, silent, when, nader, asked, him, why, he, remained, silent, hasan, ali, replied, that, the, best, thing, for, nader, to, do, would, be, assembling, all, leading, men, of, the, state, in, order, to, receive, their, agreement, in, a, signed, and, sealed, document, of, consent, nader, approved, with, the, proposal, and, the, writers, of, the, chancellery, which, included, the, court, historian, mirza, mehdi, khan, astarabadi, were, instructed, with, sending, out, orders, to, the, military, clergy, and, nobility, of, the, nation, to, summon, at, the, plains, the, summonses, for, the, people, to, attend, had, gone, out, in, november, 1735, and, they, began, arriving, in, january, 1736, in, the, same, month, of, january, 1736, nader, held, a, qoroltai, a, grand, meeting, in, the, tradition, of, genghis, khan, and, timur, on, the, moghan, plains, the, moghan, plain, was, specifically, chosen, for, its, size, and, abundance, of, fodder, everyone, agreed, to, the, proposal, of, nader, becoming, the, new, king, many, if, not, most, enthusiastically, the, rest, fearing, nader, s, anger, if, they, showed, support, for, the, deposed, safavids, nader, was, crowned, shah, of, iran, on, 8, march, 1736, a, date, his, astrologers, had, chosen, as, being, especially, favorable, in, attendance, of, an, exceptionally, large, assembly, composed, of, the, military, religious, and, nobility, of, the, nation, as, well, as, the, ottoman, ambassador, ali, pasha, he, cut, a, deal, with, notables, and, the, clergy, that, he, would, only, assume, the, position, of, shah, if, they, promised, to, refrain, from, cursing, omar, and, uthman, avoid, beating, themselves, to, draw, blood, at, the, ashura, festival, accept, sunni, practices, as, legitimate, and, to, obey, nader, s, children, and, relatives, after, his, death, thereby, setting, up, a, dynasty, in, his, name, he, was, effectively, realigning, persia, with, sunni, islam, the, notables, accepted, the, safavids, had, forced, shia, islam, as, the, state, religion, of, iran, nader, may, have, been, brought, up, as, a, shiite, on, the, basis, of, his, name, and, background, but, later, replaced, shia, law, with, a, version, of, that, was, more, sympathetic, and, compatible, with, sunni, law, he, called, the, ja, fari, school, in, an, effort, to, disassociate, radical, shia, islam, from, the, state, in, part, to, please, his, supporters, and, also, to, improve, relationships, with, other, sunni, powers, as, he, gained, power, and, began, to, push, into, the, ottoman, empire, he, believed, that, safavid, shia, islam, had, intensified, the, conflict, with, the, sunni, ottoman, empire, his, army, was, a, mix, of, shia, and, sunni, muslims, with, a, notable, minority, of, christians, and, kurds, and, included, his, own, qizilbash, as, well, as, uzbeks, afghans, christian, georgians, and, armenians, and, others, he, wanted, iran, to, adopt, a, form, of, religion, that, would, be, more, acceptable, to, sunni, muslims, and, suggested, that, iran, adopt, a, form, of, shia, islam, he, called, ja, fari, in, honour, of, the, sixth, shia, imam, ja, far, al, sadiq, he, banned, certain, shia, practices, which, were, particularly, offensive, to, sunni, muslims, such, as, the, cursing, of, the, first, three, caliphs, of, islam, personally, nader, is, said, to, have, been, indifferent, towards, religion, and, the, french, jesuit, who, served, as, his, personal, physician, reported, that, it, was, difficult, to, know, which, religion, he, followed, and, that, many, who, knew, him, best, said, that, he, had, none, nader, hoped, that, ja, farism, would, be, accepted, as, a, fifth, school, madhhab, of, sunni, islam, and, that, the, ottomans, would, allow, its, adherents, to, go, on, the, hajj, or, pilgrimage, to, mecca, which, was, within, their, territory, in, the, subsequent, peace, negotiations, the, ottomans, refused, to, acknowledge, ja, farism, as, a, fifth, mazhab, but, they, did, allow, iranian, pilgrims, to, go, on, the, hajj, nader, was, interested, in, gaining, rights, for, iranians, to, go, on, the, hajj, in, part, because, of, revenues, from, the, pilgrimage, trade, nader, s, other, primary, aim, in, his, religious, reforms, was, to, weaken, the, safavids, further, since, shia, islam, had, always, been, a, major, element, in, support, for, the, dynasty, he, had, a, shia, mullah, of, iran, strangled, after, he, was, heard, expressing, support, for, the, safavids, among, his, reforms, was, the, introduction, of, what, came, to, be, known, as, the, kolah, e, naderi, this, was, a, hat, with, four, peaks, which, symbolised, the, first, four, caliphs, of, islam, alternatively, it, has, also, been, recorded, that, the, four, peaks, symbolised, the, territories, of, persia, india, turkestan, and, khwarezm, in, 1741, eight, muslim, scholars, and, three, european, and, five, armenian, priests, translated, the, koran, and, the, gospels, the, commission, was, supervised, by, m, rz, mo, ammad, mahd, khan, mon, the, court, historiographer, and, author, of, the, tarikh, e, jahangoshay, e, naderi, history, of, nader, shah, s, wars, finished, translations, were, presented, to, n, der, shah, in, qazv, n, in, june, 1741, who, however, was, not, impressed, nader, diverted, money, going, to, shia, mullahs, and, redirected, it, to, his, army, instead, in, 1738, nader, shah, conquered, kandahar, the, last, outpost, of, the, hotaki, dynasty, his, thoughts, now, turned, to, the, mughal, empire, of, india, this, once, powerful, muslim, state, to, the, east, was, falling, apart, as, the, nobles, became, increasingly, disobedient, and, local, opponents, such, as, the, sikhs, and, hindu, marathas, of, the, maratha, empire, were, expanding, upon, its, territory, its, ruler, muhammad, shah, was, powerless, to, reverse, this, disintegration, nader, asked, for, the, afghan, rebels, to, be, handed, over, but, the, mughal, emperor, refused, nader, used, the, pretext, of, his, afghan, enemies, taking, refuge, in, india, to, cross, the, border, and, invade, the, militarily, weak, but, still, extremely, wealthy, far, eastern, empire, and, in, a, brilliant, campaign, against, the, governor, of, peshawar, he, took, a, small, contingent, of, his, forces, on, a, daunting, flank, march, through, nearly, impassable, mountain, passes, and, took, the, enemy, forces, positioned, at, the, mouth, of, the, khyber, pass, completely, by, surprise, utterly, beating, them, despite, being, outnumbered, two, to, one, this, led, to, the, capture, of, ghazni, kabul, peshawar, sindh, and, lahore, as, he, moved, into, the, mughal, territories, he, was, loyally, accompanied, by, his, georgian, subject, and, future, king, of, eastern, georgia, erekle, ii, who, led, a, georgian, contingent, as, a, military, commander, as, part, of, nader, s, force, following, the, prior, defeat, of, mughal, forces, he, then, advanced, deeper, into, india, crossing, the, river, indus, before, the, end, of, year, the, news, of, the, iranian, army, s, swift, and, decisive, successes, against, the, northern, vassal, states, of, the, mughal, empire, caused, much, consternation, in, delhi, prompting, the, mughal, ruler, muhammad, shah, to, raise, an, army, of, some, 300, 000, men, and, march, to, confront, nader, shah, despite, being, outnumbered, by, six, to, one, nader, shah, crushed, the, mughal, army, in, less, than, three, hours, at, the, huge, battle, of, karnal, on, 13, february, 1739, after, this, spectacular, victory, nader, captured, mohammad, shah, and, entered, delhi, when, a, rumour, broke, out, that, nader, had, been, assassinated, some, indians, attacked, and, killed, iranian, troops, by, midday, 900, iranian, soldiers, had, been, killed, nader, furious, reacted, by, ordering, his, soldiers, to, sack, the, city, during, the, course, of, one, day, 22, march, 20, 000, to, 30, 000, indians, were, killed, by, the, iranian, troops, and, as, many, as, 10, 000, women, and, children, were, taken, as, slaves, forcing, mohammad, shah, to, beg, nader, for, mercy, in, response, nader, shah, agreed, to, withdraw, but, mohammad, shah, paid, the, consequence, in, handing, over, the, keys, of, his, royal, treasury, and, losing, even, the, fabled, peacock, throne, to, the, iranian, emperor, the, peacock, throne, thereafter, served, as, a, symbol, of, iranian, imperial, might, it, is, estimated, that, nader, took, away, with, him, treasures, worth, as, much, as, seven, hundred, million, rupees, among, a, trove, of, other, fabulous, jewels, nader, also, looted, the, koh, i, noor, meaning, mountain, of, light, in, persian, and, darya, ye, noor, meaning, sea, of, light, diamonds, the, iranian, troops, left, delhi, at, the, beginning, of, may, 1739, but, before, they, left, he, ceded, back, to, muhammad, shah, all, territories, to, the, east, of, the, indus, which, he, had, overrun, the, booty, they, had, collected, was, loaded, on, 700, elephants, 4, 000, camels, and, 12, 000, horses, nader, shah, left, the, area, via, the, mountains, in, northern, punjab, learning, of, his, planned, route, the, sikhs, started, gathering, light, cavalry, bands, and, planned, an, attack, to, capture, his, plunder, the, sikhs, fell, upon, nadir, s, army, in, the, chenab, valley, and, seized, a, large, amount, of, the, booty, and, freed, most, of, the, slaves, in, captivity, the, persians, however, were, unable, to, pursue, the, sikhs, because, they, were, overloaded, with, the, remaining, plunder, and, overwhelmed, by, the, terrible, heat, of, that, may, traveling, with, an, advance, guard, nader, shah, stopped, at, lahore, where, he, learned, of, his, losses, he, traveled, back, to, his, forces, accompanied, by, governor, zakariya, khan, upon, learning, about, the, sikhs, he, told, khan, that, these, rebels, would, one, day, rule, the, land, still, the, remaining, plunder, his, forces, had, seized, from, india, was, so, much, that, nader, was, able, to, stop, taxation, in, iran, for, three, years, following, his, return, many, historians, believe, that, nader, attacked, the, mughal, empire, to, give, his, country, some, breathing, space, after, previous, turmoil, his, successful, campaign, and, replenishment, of, funds, meant, that, he, could, continue, his, wars, against, iran, s, archrival, and, neighbour, the, ottoman, empire, as, well, as, the, campaigns, in, the, north, caucasus, nader, also, secured, one, of, the, mughal, emperor, s, daughters, jahan, afruz, banu, begum, as, a, bride, for, his, youngest, son, the, indian, campaign, was, the, zenith, of, nader, s, career, afterwards, he, became, increasingly, despotic, as, his, health, declined, markedly, nader, had, left, his, son, reza, qoli, mirza, to, rule, iran, in, his, absence, reza, had, behaved, highhandedly, and, somewhat, cruelly, but, he, had, kept, the, peace, in, iran, having, heard, rumours, that, his, father, had, died, he, had, made, preparations, for, assuming, the, crown, these, included, the, murder, of, the, former, shah, tahmasp, and, his, family, including, the, nine, year, old, abbas, iii, on, hearing, the, news, reza, s, wife, who, was, tahmasp, s, sister, committed, suicide, nader, was, not, impressed, with, his, son, s, waywardness, and, reprimanded, him, but, he, took, him, on, his, expedition, to, conquer, territory, in, transoxiana, in, 1740, he, conquered, the, khanate, of, khiva, after, the, iranians, had, forced, the, uzbek, khanate, of, bukhara, to, submit, nader, wanted, reza, to, marry, the, khan, s, elder, daughter, because, she, was, a, descendant, of, his, hero, genghis, khan, but, reza, flatly, refused, and, nader, married, the, girl, himself, with, regard, to, central, asia, nader, viewed, merv, present, day, bayramali, turkmenistan, vital, to, his, north, eastern, defenses, he, also, tried, to, secure, the, ruler, of, bukhara, as, his, vassal, imitating, previous, great, conquerors, of, mongol, timurid, descent, according, to, a, british, scholar, peter, avery, nader, s, attitude, towards, bukhara, was, irredentist, to, an, extent, that, he, may, even, have, thought, that, if, only, the, ottoman, power, in, the, west, could, be, contained, he, might, make, bukhara, a, base, for, conquests, further, afield, in, central, asia, nader, dispatched, numerous, artisans, to, merv, in, a, move, to, prepare, for, an, improbable, conquest, of, distant, kashgaria, such, a, campaign, did, not, materialize, but, nader, frequently, sent, funds, and, engineers, to, merv, trying, to, restore, its, prosperity, and, rebuild, its, ill, fated, dam, merv, however, did, not, become, prosperous, nader, now, decided, to, punish, dagestan, for, the, death, of, his, brother, ebrahim, qoli, on, a, campaign, a, few, years, earlier, in, 1741, while, nader, was, passing, through, the, forest, of, mazanderan, on, his, way, to, fight, the, dagestanis, an, assassin, took, a, shot, at, him, but, nader, was, only, lightly, wounded, he, began, to, suspect, his, son, was, behind, the, attempt, and, confined, him, to, tehran, nader, s, increasing, ill, health, made, his, temper, ever, worse, perhaps, it, was, his, illness, that, made, nader, lose, the, initiative, in, his, war, against, the, lezgin, tribes, of, dagestan, frustratingly, for, him, they, resorted, to, guerrilla, warfare, and, the, iranians, could, make, little, headway, against, them, though, nader, managed, to, take, most, of, dagestan, during, his, campaign, the, effective, guerrilla, warfare, as, deployed, by, the, lezgins, but, also, the, avars, and, laks, made, the, iranian, re, conquest, of, the, particular, north, caucasian, region, a, short, lived, one, several, years, later, nader, was, forced, to, withdraw, during, the, same, period, nader, accused, his, son, of, being, behind, the, assassination, attempt, in, mazanderan, reza, qoli, angrily, protested, his, innocence, but, nader, had, him, blinded, as, punishment, and, ordered, his, eyes, to, be, brought, to, him, on, a, platter, when, his, orders, had, been, carried, out, however, nader, instantly, regretted, it, crying, out, to, his, courtiers, what, is, a, father, what, is, a, son, soon, afterwards, nader, started, executing, the, nobles, who, had, witnessed, his, son, s, blinding, in, his, last, years, nader, became, increasingly, paranoid, ordering, the, assassination, of, large, numbers, of, suspected, enemies, following, the, orders, of, nadir, shah, his, soldiers, executed, 150, monks, at, monastery, of, saint, elijah, after, they, refused, to, convert, to, islam, with, the, wealth, he, gained, nader, started, to, build, an, iranian, navy, with, lumber, from, mazandaran, he, built, ships, in, bushehr, he, also, purchased, thirty, ships, in, india, he, recaptured, the, island, of, bahrain, from, the, arabs, in, 1743, he, conquered, oman, and, its, main, capital, muscat, in, 1743, nader, started, another, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, despite, having, a, huge, army, at, his, disposal, in, this, campaign, nader, showed, little, of, his, former, military, brilliance, it, ended, in, 1746, with, the, signing, of, a, peace, treaty, the, treaty, of, kerden, in, which, the, ottomans, agreed, to, let, nader, occupy, najaf, nader, changed, the, iranian, coinage, system, he, minted, silver, coins, called, naderi, that, were, equal, to, the, mughal, rupee, nader, discontinued, the, policy, of, paying, soldiers, based, on, land, tenure, like, the, late, safavids, he, resettled, tribes, nader, shah, transformed, the, shahsevan, a, nomadic, group, living, around, azerbaijan, whose, name, literally, means, shah, lover, into, a, tribal, confederacy, which, defended, iran, against, the, neighbouring, ottomans, and, russians, in, addition, he, increased, the, number, of, soldiers, under, his, command, and, reduced, the, number, of, soldiers, under, tribal, and, provincial, control, his, reforms, may, have, strengthened, the, country, but, they, did, little, to, improve, iran, s, suffering, economy, he, also, always, paid, his, troops, on, time, no, matter, what, in, order, to, construct, a, broad, political, framework, that, could, link, him, to, the, ottomans, and, mughals, more, closely, than, the, safavids, had, been, nader, shah, started, creating, new, concepts, one, of, these, was, a, focus, on, a, shared, turkmen, descent, by, having, several, official, documents, evoke, how, nader, shah, the, ottomans, uzbeks, and, mughals, all, had, a, shared, turkmen, background, in, a, broad, sense, this, concept, mirrored, the, origin, fables, of, 15th, century, anatolian, turkmen, dynasties, the, ottomans, however, were, left, unimpressed, with, nader, shah, s, new, concept, according, to, the, modern, historian, ernest, tucker, comparing, this, concept, to, an, early, version, of, pan, turkism, would, be, anachronistic, and, misleading, he, adds, that, this, was, part, of, unpolished, drafts, of, concepts, that, would, get, polished, throughout, the, 11, years, of, nader, shah, s, reign, and, would, include, wide, political, and, religious, aspects, nader, s, concepts, regarding, the, ja, farism, and, common, turkmen, descent, were, directed, primarily, at, the, ottomans, and, mughals, he, may, have, perceived, a, need, to, unite, disparate, components, of, the, ummah, against, the, expanding, power, of, europe, at, that, time, however, his, view, of, muslim, unity, was, different, from, later, concepts, of, it, he, proposed, a, peace, treaty, with, the, ottomans, in, it, he, proclaimed, the, persians, wanted, the, ja, fari, maddhab, to, be, incorporated, as, a, madhhab, of, islam, while, only, a, nominal, claim, nader, s, army, was, increasingly, drawing, from, sunni, afghans, kurds, turkmens, baloch, and, others, who, were, happy, with, a, less, sectarian, persia, externally, he, presented, persia, as, completely, sympathetic, to, sunnis, he, probably, did, this, for, political, reasons, in, order, to, increase, his, legitimacy, within, the, muslim, world, he, would, have, never, been, accepted, if, he, remained, a, radical, shia, muslim, like, the, safavid, shahs, though, as, stated, countless, times, before, internally, he, was, probably, agnostic, whenever, nader, laid, siege, to, a, city, he, would, construct, a, city, of, his, own, outside, the, walls, his, encampment, was, filled, with, markets, mosques, bathhouses, coffeehouses, and, stables, he, did, this, to, show, the, besieged, his, army, would, be, there, for, the, long, haul, to, prevent, diseases, from, spreading, within, his, troops, ranks, and, to, occupy, his, troops, time, nader, became, increasingly, cruel, as, a, result, of, his, illness, and, his, desire, to, extort, more, and, more, tax, money, to, pay, for, his, military, campaigns, new, revolts, broke, out, and, nader, crushed, them, ruthlessly, building, towers, from, his, victims, skulls, in, imitation, of, his, hero, timur, in, 1747, nader, set, off, for, khorasan, where, he, intended, to, punish, kurdish, rebels, some, of, his, officers, and, courtiers, feared, he, was, about, to, execute, them, and, plotted, against, him, including, two, of, his, relatives, muhammad, quli, khan, the, captain, of, the, guards, and, salah, khan, the, overseer, of, nader, s, household, nader, shah, was, assassinated, on, 20, june, 1747, at, quchan, in, khorasan, he, was, surprised, in, his, sleep, by, around, fifteen, conspirators, and, stabbed, to, death, nader, was, able, to, kill, two, of, the, assassins, before, he, died, the, most, detailed, account, of, nader, s, assassination, comes, from, p, re, louis, bazin, nader, s, physician, at, the, time, of, his, death, who, relied, on, the, eyewitness, testimony, of, chuki, one, of, nader, s, favourite, concubines, around, fifteen, of, the, conspirators, were, impatient, or, merely, eager, to, distinguish, themselves, and, so, turned, up, prematurely, at, the, agreed, meeting, place, they, entered, the, enclosure, of, the, royal, tent, pushing, and, smashing, their, way, through, any, obstacles, and, penetrated, into, the, sleeping, quarters, of, that, ill, starred, monarch, the, noise, they, made, on, entering, woke, him, up, who, goes, there, he, shouted, out, in, a, roar, where, is, my, sword, bring, me, my, weapons, the, assassins, were, struck, with, fear, by, these, words, and, wanted, to, escape, but, ran, straight, into, the, two, chiefs, of, the, murder, conspiracy, who, allayed, their, fears, and, made, them, go, into, the, tent, again, nader, shah, had, not, yet, had, time, to, get, dressed, muhammad, quli, khan, ran, in, first, and, struck, him, with, a, great, blow, of, his, sword, which, felled, him, to, the, ground, two, or, three, others, followed, suit, the, wretched, monarch, covered, in, his, own, blood, attempted, but, was, too, weak, to, get, up, and, cried, out, why, do, you, want, to, kill, me, spare, my, life, and, all, i, have, shall, be, yours, he, was, still, pleading, when, salah, khan, ran, up, sword, in, hand, and, severed, his, head, which, he, dropped, into, the, hands, of, a, waiting, soldier, thus, perished, the, wealthiest, monarch, on, earth, after, his, death, he, was, succeeded, by, his, nephew, ali, qoli, who, renamed, himself, adel, shah, righteous, king, adel, shah, was, probably, involved, in, the, assassination, plot, adel, shah, was, deposed, within, a, year, during, the, struggle, between, adel, shah, his, brother, ibrahim, khan, and, nader, s, grandson, shah, rukh, and, almost, all, provincial, governors, declared, independence, established, their, own, states, and, the, entire, empire, of, nader, shah, fell, into, anarchy, oman, and, the, uzbek, khanates, of, bukhara, and, khiva, regained, independence, while, the, ottoman, empire, regained, the, lost, territories, in, western, armenia, and, mesopotamia, finally, karim, khan, founded, the, zand, dynasty, and, became, ruler, of, iran, by, 1760, erekle, ii, and, teimuraz, ii, who, in, 1744, had, been, made, the, kings, of, kakheti, and, kartli, respectively, by, nader, himself, for, their, loyal, service, capitalized, on, the, eruption, of, instability, and, declared, de, facto, independence, erekle, ii, assumed, control, over, kartli, after, teimuraz, ii, s, death, thus, unifying, the, two, as, the, kingdom, of, kartli, kakheti, becoming, the, first, georgian, ruler, in, three, centuries, to, preside, over, a, politically, unified, eastern, georgia, and, due, to, the, frantic, turn, of, events, in, mainland, iran, he, would, be, able, to, maintain, its, autonomy, until, the, advent, of, the, iranian, qajar, dynasty, the, rest, of, the, iranian, territories, in, the, caucasus, comprising, modern, day, azerbaijan, armenia, and, dagestan, broke, away, into, various, khanates, until, the, advent, of, the, zands, and, qajars, its, rulers, had, various, forms, of, autonomy, but, stayed, vassals, and, subjects, to, the, iranian, king, in, the, far, east, ahmad, shah, durrani, had, already, proclaimed, independence, marking, the, foundation, of, modern, afghanistan, iran, finally, lost, bahrain, to, house, of, khalifa, during, invasion, of, bani, utbah, in, 1783, nader, shah, was, well, known, to, the, european, public, of, the, time, in, 1768, christian, vii, of, denmark, commissioned, sir, william, jones, to, translate, a, persian, language, biography, of, nader, shah, written, by, his, minister, mirza, mehdi, khan, astarabadi, into, french, it, was, published, in, 1770, as, histoire, de, nadir, chah, nader, s, indian, campaign, alerted, the, east, india, company, to, the, extreme, weakness, of, the, mughal, empire, and, the, possibility, of, expanding, to, fill, the, power, vacuum, without, nader, eventual, british, would, have, come, later, and, in, a, different, form, perhaps, never, at, all, with, important, global, effects, joseph, stalin, leader, of, the, soviet, union, is, said, to, have, admired, him, and, called, him, a, teacher, alongside, ivan, the, terrible, the, military, success, of, nader, was, nearly, unprecedented, for, muslim, shahs, nader, shah, consciously, avoided, using, the, colour, green, as, green, was, associated, with, shia, islam, and, the, safavid, dynasty, the, strong, character, of, nader, shah, is, indicated, by, the, fact, that, having, achieved, much, fame, and, glory, he, did, not, allow, his, pleasers, to, find, great, ancestors, in, the, darkness, of, his, origin, he, never, boasted, of, a, proud, genealogy, on, the, contrary, he, often, spoke, of, his, simple, origin, even, his, chronicler, was, forced, to, limit, himself, by, saying, that, diamond, was, valued, not, by, the, rock, where, it, had, been, found, but, by, its, splendor, there, is, a, story, that, says, having, demanded, the, daughter, of, his, defeated, enemy, muhammad, shah, the, emperor, of, delhi, to, marry, his, son, nasrullah, he, received, the, answer, that, a, royal, lineage, up, to, the, 7th, generation, was, required, for, marriage, with, a, princess, from, the, house, of, timur, tell, him, nader, replied, that, nasrullah, is, the, son, of, nader, shah, the, son, and, grandson, of, the, sword, and, so, on, not, until, the, 7th, but, until, the, 70th, generation, nader, had, the, greatest, contempt, for, the, weak, depraved, mahmud, shah, who, according, to, the, local, chronicler, of, that, era, was, always, with, his, mistress, in, his, arms, and, a, glass, in, his, hand, and, was, the, lowest, libertine, and, simply, a, puppet, ruler, nader, shah, once, had, a, conversation, with, a, holy, man, about, paradise, after, what, that, man, described, miracles, and, pleasures, of, the, heaven, the, shah, asked, are, there, such, things, as, war, and, victory, over, the, enemy, in, paradise, when, the, man, answered, negatively, nader, replied, how, can, there, be, any, pleasure, then, french, orientalist, louis, bazin, describes, the, personality, of, nader, shah, as, follows, despite, his, obscure, background, he, looked, born, for, the, throne, nature, endowed, him, with, all, the, great, qualities, that, make, heroes, his, dyed, beard, made, a, sharp, contrast, with, his, completely, gray, hair, his, natural, physique, was, strong, tall, and, his, waist, was, proportional, to, his, growth, his, expression, was, gloomy, with, an, oblong, face, an, aquiline, nose, and, a, beautiful, mouth, but, with, his, lower, lip, protruding, forward, he, had, small, penetrating, eyes, with, a, sharp, and, piercing, gaze, his, voice, was, rude, and, loud, although, he, knew, how, to, soften, it, on, occasion, as, required, by, personal, interest, he, did, not, have, a, permanent, home, his, military, camp, was, his, court, his, palace, was, his, tent, and, his, closest, confidants, were, his, bravest, soldiers, undaunted, in, battle, he, brought, courage, and, was, always, in, the, thick, of, danger, among, his, brave, men, as, long, as, the, battle, lasted, he, did, not, neglect, any, of, the, measures, dictated, by, foresight, nevertheless, the, repulsive, greed, and, unprecedented, cruelties, that, wore, his, subjects, ultimately, led, to, his, fall, and, the, extremes, and, horrors, that, were, caused, by, him, made, persia, cry, he, was, adored, feared, and, cursed, at, the,

a, sip, of, water, he, is, extremely, generous, especially, to, his, warriors, and, generously, rewards, all, who, have, distinguished, themselves, in, his, service, at, the, same, time, he, is, very, severe, and, strict, in, relation, to, discipline, punishing, with, the, death, penalty, all, who, have, committed, major, misconduct, he, never, forgives, the, guilty, no, matter, what, rank, he, is, being, on, a, march, or, in, the, field, he, confines, himself, to, food, drink, and, sleep, of, a, simple, soldier, and, forces, all, his, officers, to, follow, the, same, harsh, discipline, he, has, such, a, strong, physique, that, he, often, sleeps, on, a, frosty, night, on, bare, ground, in, the, open, air, wrapping, himself, only, in, his, cloak, and, putting, a, saddle, under, his, head, as, a, pillow, in, private, conversations, no, one, is, allowed, to, talk, about, government, affairs, member, of, the, french, academy, of, sciences, pierre, bayen, wrote, about, nader, shah, the, following, he, was, the, horror, of, the, ottoman, empire, the, conqueror, of, india, the, ruler, of, persia, and, all, of, asia, his, neighbors, respected, him, his, enemies, were, afraid, of, him, and, he, lacked, only, the, love, of, his, subjects, one, punjabi, contemporary, poet, described, the, rule, of, nader, as, a, time, when, all, of, india, trembled, with, horror, the, kashmiri,

a, simple, origin, rose, to, such, greatness, that, monarchs, rarely, have, from, birth, joseph, stalin, used, to, read, about, nader, shah, and, admired, him, calling, him, along, with, ivan, the,

garments, and, disdained, courtly, sophistication, and, lavish, lifestyles, particularly, that, of, the, safavids, he, ate, simple, foods, and, restrained, himself, from, being, tied, to, his, harem, and, liquor, unlike, soltan, husayn, and, tahmasp, ii, nader, did, not, want, historians, to, detail, his, military, victories, too, closely, because, he, feared, others, would, copy, his, brilliant,
