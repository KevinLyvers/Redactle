donato, di, niccol, di, betto, bardi, c, 1386, 13, december, 1466, known, mononymously, as, donatello, english, d, n, t, l, o, italian, was, an, italian, sculptor, of, the, renaissance, period, born, in, florence, he, studied, classical, sculpture, and, used, his, knowledge, to, develop, an, early, renaissance, style, of, sculpture, he, spent, time, in, other, cities, where, he, worked, on, commissions, and, taught, others, his, periods, in, rome, padua, and, siena, introduced, to, other, parts, of, italy, the, techniques, he, had, developed, in, the, course, of, a, long, and, productive, career, his, david, was, the, first, freestanding, nude, male, sculpture, since, antiquity, like, much, of, his, work, it, was, commissioned, by, the, medici, family, he, worked, with, stone, bronze, wood, clay, stucco, and, wax, and, used, glass, in, inventive, ways, he, had, several, assistants, with, four, perhaps, being, a, typical, number, although, his, best, known, works, are, mostly, statues, executed, in, the, round, he, developed, a, new, very, shallow, type, of, bas, relief, for, small, works, and, a, good, deal, of, his, output, was, architectural, reliefs, for, pulpits, altars, and, tombs, as, well, as, madonna, and, child, s, for, homes, broad, overlapping, phases, can, be, seen, in, his, style, beginning, with, the, development, of, expressiveness, and, classical, monumentality, in, statues, then, developing, energy, and, charm, mostly, in, smaller, works, early, on, he, veered, away, from, the, international, gothic, style, he, learned, from, lorenzo, ghiberti, with, classically, informed, pieces, and, further, on, a, number, of, stark, even, brutal, pieces, the, sensuous, eroticism, of, his, most, famous, work, the, bronze, david, is, very, rarely, seen, in, other, pieces, all, accounts, describe, donatello, as, amiable, and, well, liked, but, rather, poor, at, the, business, side, of, his, career, like, not, only, michelangelo, in, the, next, century, he, tended, to, accept, more, commissions, than, he, could, handle, and, many, works, were, either, completed, some, years, late, handed, to, other, sculptors, to, finish, or, never, produced, again, like, michelangelo, he, enjoyed, steady, support, and, patronage, from, the, medici, family, all, sources, agree, that, he, carved, stone, and, modelled, clay, or, wax, for, bronzes, very, quickly, and, confidently, and, art, historians, feel, able, to, distinguish, his, hand, from, that, of, others, even, within, the, same, work, italian, renaissance, sculptors, nearly, always, used, assistants, with, the, master, often, giving, parts, of, a, piece, over, to, them, but, donatello, who, would, perhaps, not, have, been, good, at, managing, a, large, workshop, like, that, of, ghiberti, seems, to, have, had, at, most, times, a, relatively, small, number, of, experienced, assistants, some, of, whom, became, significant, masters, in, their, own, right, the, technical, quality, of, his, work, can, vary, especially, in, bronze, pieces, where, casting, faults, may, occur, even, the, bronze, david, has, a, hole, under, his, chin, and, a, patch, on, his, thigh, donatello, certainly, made, drawings, probably, especially, for, reliefs, in, the, case, of, his, stained, glass, designs, and, perhaps, other, works, these, were, his, whole, contribution, vasari, claimed, to, have, several, in, his, collection, which, he, praised, highly, i, have, both, nude, and, draped, figures, various, animals, which, astound, anyone, who, sees, them, and, other, beautiful, things, but, very, few, if, any, surviving, drawings, are, now, accepted, as, probably, by, his, own, hand, and, these, are, strong, and, lively, sketches, with, figures, such, as, the, three, in, its, collections, that, the, french, government, still, attributes, to, donatello, himself, a, story, told, both, by, vasari, and, the, earlier, pomponio, gaurico, says, that, he, kept, a, bucket, containing, money, hanging, on, a, cord, from, the, ceiling, of, his, workshop, from, which, those, around, could, take, if, they, needed, it, a, tax, return, from, 1427, near, the, peak, of, his, career, shows, a, much, lower, income, than, ghiberti, s, for, the, same, year, and, he, seems, to, have, died, in, modest, circumstances, although, this, may, not, have, been, of, concern, to, him, he, was, very, happy, in, his, old, age, according, to, vasari, donatello, was, born, in, florence, probably, in, 1386, based, on, his, own, later, statement, in, his, catasto, tax, declaration, he, claimed, to, be, 41, years, old, in, july, 1427, he, was, the, son, of, niccol, di, betto, bardi, who, was, a, wool, stretcher, tiratore, di, lana, and, member, of, the, florentine, arte, della, lana, the, wool, workers, guild, which, probably, provided, a, good, income, donatello, s, actual, surname, was, therefore, bardi, but, if, he, was, related, to, the, well, known, bardi, family, of, bankers, it, seems, to, have, been, rather, distantly, the, banker, bardis, were, still, wealthy, and, powerful, despite, the, default, of, edward, iii, of, england, in, 1345, having, caused, the, failure, of, their, bank, after, contessina, de, bardi, married, cosimo, de, medici, around, 1415, any, connection, he, had, might, still, have, been, useful, to, donatello, however, donatello, s, father, did, have, a, connection, with, the, powerful, buonaccorso, pitti, whose, diary, records, a, fight, in, pisa, in, 1380, in, which, niccol, intervened, giving, pitti, s, opponent, a, fatal, blow, vasari, s, claim, that, donatello, was, raised, and, educated, in, the, house, of, the, prominent, martelli, family, is, probably, baseless, and, given, for, literary, even, political, reasons, they, were, certainly, later, keen, patrons, of, donatello, and, also, commissioned, work, from, vasari, himself, donatello, s, first, appearance, in, any, documentary, records, is, unpromising, in, january, 1401, at, the, age, of, about, 15, he, was, accused, in, pistoia, 25, miles, from, florence, and, then, controlled, by, it, of, hitting, a, german, with, a, stick, drawing, blood, he, was, probably, there, with, his, father, who, had, an, official, job, in, pistoia, at, the, time, while, buonaccorso, pitti, was, the, captain, or, governor, while, there, donatello, appears, to, have, befriended, and, perhaps, worked, with, filippo, brunelleschi, who, was, some, ten, years, older, born, in, 1377, and, although, not, yet, a, master, goldsmith, working, on, silver, figures, for, an, altar, in, pistoia, cathedral, what, experience, donatello, had, to, assist, him, if, that, was, what, he, was, doing, is, unclear, both, donatello, and, brunelleschi, returned, to, florence, in, early, 1401, in, time, for, brunelleschi, to, take, part, in, the, famous, competition, for, the, baptistery, doors, often, seen, as, the, start, of, florentine, renaissance, sculpture, seven, sculptors, were, invited, to, submit, trial, panels, for, which, they, were, paid, vasari, s, life, of, brunelleschi, wrongly, claims, that, donatello, was, one, of, them, but, they, were, all, more, experienced, figures, following, vasari, and, brunelleschi, s, biographer, antonio, manetti, the, unexpected, result, declared, by, the, 34, judges, was, that, the, entries, by, two, young, florentines, lorenzo, ghiberti, and, brunelleschi, were, the, best, an, attempt, was, made, to, get, the, two, to, share, the, commission, but, amid, bitter, recriminations, that, lasted, for, years, this, failed, and, ghiberti, was, given, the, whole, commission, ghiberti, himself, on, the, other, hand, and, the, only, contemporary, voice, claimed, in, his, commentarii, that, the, vote, went, unanimously, for, him, including, the, competing, artists, any, part, played, by, the, adolescent, donatello, presumably, assisting, brunelleschi, with, his, trial, piece, is, unknown, after, the, final, result, in, late, 1402, or, early, 1403, they, seem, to, have, left, for, rome, together, staying, until, at, least, the, next, year, to, study, the, artistic, and, architectural, remains, left, by, ancient, rome, then, very, abundant, though, for, the, most, part, still, buried, they, were, very, early, in, this, effectively, archaeological, pursuit, which, included, measuring, remains, and, hiring, labourers, to, excavate, the, main, source, for, this, period, is, the, biography, of, brunelleschi, by, antonio, manetti, 1423, 1497, who, knew, both, men, but, it, was, written, after, their, deaths, in, the, 1470s, vasari, just, repeats, a, shorter, version, of, manetti, s, account, according, to, which, both, men, were, able, to, support, themselves, by, jobs, for, roman, goldsmiths, which, probably, represented, important, training, for, donatello, perhaps, they, were, also, able, to, sell, excavated, sculptures, brunelleschi, subsequently, became, a, highly, important, architect, while, donatello, began, his, career, in, sculpture, donatello, is, recorded, as, working, as, an, apprentice, and, for, the, last, few, months, on, a, salary, in, the, studio, of, lorenzo, ghiberti, in, 1404, 1407, apparently, working, on, the, workshop, s, main, project, the, bronze, doors, of, the, florence, baptistery, and, from, 1406, on, he, began, stone, carving, at, the, cathedral, for, the, porta, della, mandorla, on, its, north, side, a, large, project, that, was, still, some, years, from, completion, he, was, paid, in, november, 1406, for, a, figure, of, a, prophet, on, the, door, most, probably, the, one, for, the, left, pinnacle, now, in, the, museo, dell, opera, del, duomo, the, cathedral, museum, by, early, 1408, donatello, had, acquired, sufficient, reputation, to, be, given, the, commission, for, a, life, size, prophet, for, the, cathedral, to, be, paired, with, another, by, nanni, di, banco, a, brilliant, sculptor, of, donatello, s, age, who, seems, to, have, been, both, a, rival, and, friend, in, the, end, they, were, not, placed, as, intended, probably, because, they, appeared, too, small, from, far, below, and, the, donatello, appears, to, be, lost, from, now, on, he, received, a, series, of, commissions, for, full, size, statues, for, prominent, public, locations, these, are, now, among, his, most, famous, works, but, after, about, 1425, he, produced, few, sculptures, of, this, type, his, marble, david, may, date, from, around, this, time, or, slightly, later, perhaps, 1412, he, was, commissioned, to, rework, it, in, 1416, the, cathedral, surrendering, it, to, the, republic, who, placed, in, the, seat, of, government, the, palazzo, vecchio, it, was, one, of, the, early, cases, in, monumental, sculpture, where, he, is, portrayed, as, a, youth, rather, than, the, king, of, israel, and, teeters, between, the, gothic, and, renaissance, worlds, in, 1409, 1411, he, executed, the, colossal, seated, figure, of, saint, john, the, evangelist, which, occupied, a, niche, of, the, old, cathedral, fa, ade, until, 1588, and, is, now, in, the, cathedral, museum, this, was, placed, with, the, base, about, 3, metres, from, the, ground, and, donatello, adjusts, his, composition, with, this, in, mind, since, 2015, it, and, other, cathedral, sculptures, have, been, displayed, at, their, original, heights, in, 1415, the, cathedral, authorities, decided, to, revive, and, complete, medieval, projects, and, add, eight, lifesize, marble, figures, for, the, niches, of, the, higher, levels, of, giotto, s, campanile, adjoining, the, cathedral, as, well, as, complete, a, row, on, the, cathedral, facade, in, which, donatello, was, not, involved, all, the, figures, for, the, campanile, series, were, removed, in, 1940, to, be, replaced, by, replicas, with, the, originals, moved, to, the, museo, dell, opera, del, duomo, they, were, placed, very, high, and, so, were, seen, from, a, distance, at, a, sharp, angle, factors, which, needed, allowing, for, in, the, compositions, and, made, fine, detail, virtually, useless, for, visual, effect, since, 2015, the, museum, s, new, displays, show, this, and, other, statues, for, the, cathedral, at, the, intended, original, heights, donatello, was, responsible, for, six, of, the, eight, campanile, figures, in, two, cases, working, with, the, younger, nanni, di, bartolo, il, rosso, the, commissions, and, starts, stretched, between, 1414, and, 1423, and, while, most, were, completed, by, 1421, the, last, of, his, statues, was, not, finished, until, 1435, this, was, the, striking, zuccone, baldy, or, pumpkin, head, probably, intended, as, habakkuk, or, jeremiah, the, best, known, of, the, series, and, reportedly, donatello, s, favourite, his, other, statues, for, the, campanile, are, known, as, the, beardless, prophet, and, bearded, prophet, both, from, 1414, to, 1420, the, sacrifice, of, isaac, with, nanni, di, batolo, 1421, il, populano, a, prophet, not, finally, finished, until, 1435, the, visibility, of, statues, high, on, the, cathedral, buildings, was, to, remain, a, concern, for, the, rest, of, the, century, michelangelo, s, david, was, intended, for, such, a, place, but, proved, too, heavy, to, raise, and, support, donatello, with, brunelleschi, proposed, a, large, but, lightweight, solution, and, made, a, prophet, joshua, with, a, brick, core, then, a, modelled, layer, of, clay, or, terracotta, all, painted, white, this, was, put, in, place, on, the, cathedral, some, time, after, 1415, and, remained, until, the, 18th, century, it, was, known, as, the, white, colossus, or, homo, magnus, et, albus, large, white, man, another, large, scale, sculptural, project, in, the, city, was, the, completion, of, the, statues, for, the, niches, around, the, outside, of, the, rectangular, orsanmichele, a, building, owned, by, the, guilds, of, florence, which, was, in, the, process, of, turning, itself, from, a, grain, market, to, a, church, on, the, ground, floor, still, with, offices, above, there, were, 14, niches, around, the, outside, and, each, of, the, main, guilds, was, responsible, for, one, normally, choosing, their, patron, saint, the, location, had, the, advantage, that, the, niches, were, much, lower, than, on, the, cathedral, with, the, feet, of, the, statues, some, three, metres, above, ground, level, nevertheless, according, to, a, story, in, vasari, donatello, had, trouble, with, his, first, statue, for, orsanmichele, a, marble, st, mark, 1411, 1413, for, the, linen, weavers, guild, viewing, the, finished, statue, at, ground, level, the, weavers, did, not, like, it, donatello, got, them, to, put, it, in, its, niche, and, cover, it, up, while, he, worked, to, improve, it, after, two, weeks, under, cover, he, showed, it, in, position, without, having, done, any, work, on, it, and, they, happily, accepted, it, it, has, a, contrapposto, pose, with, the, robe, on, the, leg, bearing, the, weight, in, straight, vertical, drapery, folds, resembling, the, flutes, of, a, doric, column, like, most, of, the, orsanmichele, statues, this, has, been, moved, to, the, museum, inside, and, replaced, by, a, replica, about, 1415, to, 1417, he, completed, the, marble, saint, george, for, the, confraternity, of, the, cuirass, makers, or, armourers, the, important, relief, on, the, base, is, discussed, below, and, was, slightly, later, because, of, a, staircase, on, the, other, side, of, the, wall, the, niche, is, shallower, than, the, others, but, donatello, turns, this, to, his, advantage, pushing, the, figure, forward, into, space, and, with, the, anxious, look, on, the, face, suggesting, alertness, or, prontezza, the, quality, above, all, others, singled, out, for, praise, in, the, successive, renaissance, eulogies, of, the, work, holes, and, the, shape, of, a, hand, suggest, that, the, figure, was, originally, fitted, with, a, wreath, or, helmet, on, his, head, and, carried, a, sword, or, lance, the, client, would, have, been, able, to, supply, these, pieces, in, bronze, the, gilt, bronze, saint, louis, of, toulouse, dates, to, some, years, later, 1423, 25, it, is, now, in, the, museum, of, the, basilica, di, santa, croce, having, been, replaced, in, 1460, by, the, bronze, incredulity, of, saint, thomas, by, verrocchio, it, is, technically, very, unusual, as, it, was, built, up, from, a, number, of, sections, cast, and, gilded, separately, necessitated, by, the, difficulty, of, fire, gilding, a, whole, over, life, size, figure, the, collaboration, with, michelozzo, may, have, begun, with, this, piece, and, 1423, marks, the, beginning, of, donatello, s, documented, work, in, bronze, with, three, recorded, commissions, that, year, the, saint, louis, a, reliquary, bust, of, saint, rossore, and, the, relief, for, the, siena, baptistery, discussed, below, michelozzo, had, great, experience, with, bronze, and, no, doubt, helped, with, the, technical, aspects, and, donatello, took, to, the, medium, very, quickly, in, 1418, the, signoria, commissioned, a, large, and, imposing, figure, of, florence, s, heraldic, lion, the, marzocco, for, the, entrance, to, a, new, apartment, at, santa, maria, novella, built, for, a, rare, visit, by, the, pope, in, the, event, he, did, not, finish, it, in, time, it, was, later, placed, in, the, piazza, della, signoria, where, there, is, now, a, replica, with, the, original, in, the, bargello, museum, before, about, 1410, he, made, the, painted, wooden, crucifix, now, in, santa, croce, which, features, in, a, famous, story, in, vasari, it, portrays, a, very, realistic, christ, in, a, moment, of, agony, eyes, and, mouth, partially, opened, the, body, contracted, in, an, ungraceful, posture, according, to, the, story, donatello, proudly, showed, it, to, brunelleschi, who, complained, it, made, christ, look, like, a, peasant, at, which, donatello, challenged, him, to, do, something, better, he, then, produced, the, brunelleschi, crucifix, at, the, time, brunelleschi, s, more, classical, figure, was, probably, considered, to, have, won, the, contest, but, modern, tastes, may, dispute, this, donatello, became, famous, for, his, reliefs, especially, his, development, of, a, very, low, or, shallow, relief, style, called, stiacciato, literally, flattened, out, where, all, parts, of, the, relief, are, low, this, contrasted, with, the, developing, technique, of, other, sculptors, who, included, very, high, and, low, relief, in, the, same, composition, with, ghiberti, s, gates, of, paradise, doors, 1424, 1451, for, the, florence, baptistery, a, leading, example, donatello, s, first, milestone, in, the, technique, is, his, marble, saint, george, freeing, the, princess, on, the, base, of, his, saint, george, for, orsanmichele, the, figures, project, slightly, forward, but, by, skilful, overlaps, are, brought, back, into, a, tightly, stretched, unified, skin, plane, which, is, scarcely, broken, in, surface, relief, to, suggest, a, deep, though, not, limitless, space, the, relief, does, not, provide, a, completely, coherent, system, of, perspective, nor, did, any, italian, work, for, some, five, or, six, years, after, but, the, arcaded, hall, on, the, right, represents, a, partial, scheme, of, perspective, his, next, major, development, in, this, direction, was, in, bronze, still, a, relatively, new, medium, for, him, ghiberti, had, been, involved, from, 1417, for, a, project, for, the, font, at, the, siena, baptistery, it, seems, to, have, been, his, idea, to, have, six, bronze, rather, than, marble, reliefs, and, these, were, allocated, to, him, jacopo, della, quercia, and, a, local, father, and, son, team, by, 1423, ghiberti, had, not, even, started, work, and, one, relief, the, feast, of, herod, was, given, to, donatello, instead, the, overall, subject, was, the, life, of, john, the, baptist, this, is, placed, low, the, bottom, at, about, the, level, of, the, viewer, s, knee, and, the, relief, allows, for, that, the, composition, has, figures, in, three, receding, planes, defined, by, the, architecture, at, left, herod, recoils, in, horror, as, he, is, presented, with, john, the, baptist, s, head, on, a, platter, to, the, right, of, centre, salome, is, still, dancing, in, a, space, behind, musicians, are, playing, and, beyond, them, john, s, head, is, presented, to, two, figures, one, presumably, herodias, it, does, not, represent, a, full, one, point, perspective, scheme, as, there, are, two, vanishing, points, perhaps, intended, to, create, subliminal, impressions, of, tension, and, disharmony, in, the, viewer, reflecting, the, grisly, subject, other, stiacciato, reliefs, include, the, assumption, of, the, virgin, in, the, wall, tomb, in, sant, angelo, a, nilo, naples, 1426, 1428, see, below, the, madonna, of, the, clouds, and, pazzi, madonna, both, c, 1425, 1430, and, domestic, pieces, respectively, with, and, without, a, carved, background, the, ascension, with, christ, giving, the, keys, to, saint, peter, 1428, 30, for, an, unknown, location, but, in, the, medici, collection, by, the, end, of, the, century, and, a, small, virgin, and, child, perhaps, 1426, probably, by, his, workshop, at, all, times, donatello, and, his, workshop, made, more, conventional, reliefs, at, a, variety, of, depths, and, sizes, and, in, different, materials, around, 1425, donatello, entered, into, a, formal, partnership, with, michelozzo, who, is, mainly, remembered, as, an, architect, but, was, also, a, sculptor, especially, of, smaller, scale, works, in, metal, he, had, trained, with, the, mint, making, dies, for, coins, where, he, still, had, a, salaried, position, michelozzo, was, the, younger, by, about, ten, years, and, they, had, probably, known, each, other, for, years, michelozzo, wanted, to, extract, himself, from, an, arrangement, with, ghiberti, and, donatello, had, too, much, work, and, was, poor, at, organizing, a, workshop, at, which, michelozzo, seems, to, have, excelled, both, had, very, good, relations, with, the, medici, family, and, so, their, powerful, supporters, the, partnership, was, very, successful, and, was, renewed, until, it, had, lasted, for, nine, years, when, a, dispute, that, was, mostly, the, fault, of, donatello, ended, it, the, partnership, s, combination, of, skills, in, monumental, sculpture, and, architecture, made, it, well, qualified, to, take, on, elaborate, wall, tombs, from, 1425, to, 1428, they, collaborated, on, the, tomb, of, antipope, john, xxiii, in, the, florence, baptistery, the, executors, were, giovanni, de, medici, and, medici, supporters, donatello, made, the, recumbent, bronze, figure, of, the, deceased, and, michelozzo, with, assistants, the, several, figures, in, stone, the, tomb, elegantly, integrating, a, variety, of, elements, into, a, narrow, vertical, space, in, a, classicizing, style, made, a, great, impact, and, became, the, model, for, the, quattrocento, wall, tomb, whenever, an, elaborate, or, particular, impressive, expression, was, wanted, with, variations, found, well, into, the, next, century, after, his, death, in, 1427, the, partnership, took, on, the, funerary, monument, of, cardinal, rainaldo, brancacci, a, medici, ally, at, the, church, of, sant, angelo, a, nilo, in, naples, the, work, was, done, at, pisa, on, the, coast, and, the, pieces, shipped, south, a, donkey, was, purchased, to, help, with, transport, and, in, 1426, donatello, had, bought, a, boat, to, ship, marble, from, carrara, to, pisa, donatello, s, personal, contribution, was, probably, limited, to, the, assumption, relief, discussed, above, finishing, in, 1429, for, the, font, at, the, baptistery, of, san, giovanni, siena, apart, from, the, relief, of, the, feast, of, herod, discussed, above, he, made, small, bronze, statues, of, faith, and, hope, and, three, small, bronze, spiritelli, naked, winged, putti, like, figures, classical, in, inspiration, and, highly, influential, on, later, art, images, of, the, virgin, and, child, mostly, for, homes, had, long, been, a, staple, for, italian, painters, and, becoming, affordable, ever, lower, down, the, income, scale, now, sculptors, were, producing, them, as, reliefs, in, a, variety, of, materials, and, with, the, cheaper, terracotta, or, plaster, ones, often, painted, the, attribution, of, the, large, numbers, of, such, images, is, often, difficult, especially, as, the, style, of, donatello, and, contemporaries, such, as, ghiberti, continued, to, be, used, for, them, for, a, long, time, another, type, of, work, for, sculptors, was, coats, of, arms, and, other, heraldic, pieces, for, the, outsides, of, the, palazzi, of, the, great, families, of, the, city, of, which, donatello, made, a, number, donatello, also, restored, antique, sculptures, for, the, palazzo, medici, the, breakup, of, the, partnership, with, michelozzo, seems, to, have, been, partly, precipitated, by, donatello, s, delays, in, doing, his, part, in, the, commission, for, an, exterior, pulpit, for, prato, cathedral, highlights, in, the, year, at, prato, close, to, and, controlled, by, florence, were, when, the, city, s, famous, relic, the, girdle, of, thomas, sacra, cintola, thought, to, be, the, belt, the, virgin, mary, dropped, to, thomas, the, apostle, as, she, rose, in, the, air, during, her, assumption, was, displayed, to, the, population, from, a, high, pulpit, this, took, place, five, times, every, year, one, coinciding, with, a, trade, fair, that, was, important, for, the, city, s, economy, the, commission, began, in, 1428, but, donatello, did, not, begin, work, on, his, allotted, areas, for, years, despite, relentless, chasing, by, the, prato, authorities, and, finally, cosimo, de, medici, donatello, s, reliefs, of, dancing, children, for, the, pulpit, a, veritable, bacchanalian, dance, of, half, nude, putti, pagan, in, spirit, passionate, in, its, wonderful, rhythmic, movement, were, finally, delivered, in, 1438, and, it, seems, that, though, designed, by, donatello, perhaps, using, his, first, idea, for, the, florence, cantoria, frieze, see, below, they, are, not, believed, to, have, actually, been, carved, by, him, the, prato, authorities, were, unhappy, and, the, ten, years, it, had, taken, to, get, them, finished, seems, to, have, strained, relations, with, michelozzo, and, the, partnership, was, not, renewed, in, 1434, the, two, remained, on, amicable, terms, and, were, to, collaborate, later, the, pulpit, reliefs, are, now, replaced, by, replicas, with, the, rather, weathered, originals, displayed, inside, the, cathedral, a, factor, in, the, delay, was, probably, donatello, s, travelling, which, increased, from, about, 1430, after, a, long, period, of, steady, work, and, residence, in, florence, after, his, return, from, rome, in, about, 1404, in, 1430, he, worked, with, brunelleschi, at, lucca, on, the, construction, of, a, defensive, dyke, and, wall, and, later, in, the, year, visited, pisa, lucca, again, and, finished, the, year, in, rome, where, he, spent, much, of, his, time, until, 1433, some, of, this, travel, was, to, see, antiquities, and, political, difficulties, had, greatly, reduced, the, flow, of, commissions, in, florence, michelozzo, was, also, with, donatello, in, rome, for, some, of, the, time, but, the, few, products, there, of, the, visits, lead, art, historians, to, describe, the, visits, as, mainly, resulting, in, studying, classical, works, it, is, not, clear, whether, anything, was, actually, made, there, or, executed, in, florence, and, shipped, down, there, was, probably, a, large, papal, commission, in, view, but, if, so, nothing, resulted, the, main, surviving, piece, is, a, tabernacle, surround, for, saint, peter, s, in, marble, relief, 228, cm, 89, 7, in, high, and, now, in, the, museum, there, the, main, figurative, sections, are, a, stiacciato, panel, with, the, entombment, of, christ, and, a, total, of, sixteen, child, angels, at, various, points, in, the, classicising, architectural, framework, this, first, clearly, defines, the, early, renaissance, wall, tabernacle, type, and, was, very, influential, there, was, also, the, old, fashioned, tomb, slab, for, the, cleric, giovanni, crivelli, in, santa, maria, in, aracoeli, which, might, well, not, be, attributed, to, donatello, if, he, had, not, signed, it, it, is, not, clear, whether, a, workshop, was, opened, in, rome, or, if, these, were, carved, in, florence, and, shipped, down, it, has, been, speculated, that, the, visits, led, to, meetings, between, donatello, and, leon, battista, alberti, then, in, rome, and, perhaps, writing, his, de, statua, there, may, have, been, mutual, influence, and, donatello, seems, to, have, returned, from, rome, with, an, interest, in, a, modular, system, of, human, proportions, the, bronze, david, uses, proportions, very, close, to, those, alberti, recommends, in, the, 1430s, and, 1440s, donatello, made, many, sculptures, of, young, children, dancing, as, well, as, putti, cherubs, and, a, variant, of, these, traditionally, called, spiritelli, imps, or, sprites, putti, were, not, new, in, italian, sculpture, but, were, given, a, rather, unusual, prominence, by, donatello, some, early, examples, are, three, out, of, a, group, of, six, freestanding, bronze, spiritelli, on, the, cover, for, the, font, of, the, siena, baptistery, 1429, standing, over, his, earlier, relief, of, the, feast, of, herod, discussed, above, one, dances, and, two, play, musical, instruments, they, have, been, said, to, be, the, first, true, free, standing, figurines, of, the, renaissance, and, were, enormously, influential, expressing, what, was, at, the, heart, of, the, renaissance, the, classical, reborn, into, the, christian, his, most, famous, work, in, this, genre, is, his, relief, frieze, for, the, cantoria, or, singing, gallery, of, florence, cathedral, there, are, two, of, these, galleries, rather, high, on, the, walls, of, the, nave, luca, della, robbia, had, been, given, the, commission, for, the, first, in, 1431, and, donatello, for, the, second, in, 1433, with, his, contract, promising, 20, higher, payment, if, his, were, more, beautiful, than, della, robbia, s, they, develop, the, style, of, the, prato, pulpit, reliefs, the, figures, primarily, symbols, of, dionysiac, abandon, and, the, childish, character, of, their, bodies, is, forgotten, in, our, sense, of, their, liberated, animal, life, if, in, a, photograph, we, cover, their, heads, our, first, glance, reveals, a, bacchic, sarcophagus, more, intricate, and, vigorous, than, anything, in, antique, art, and, only, on, looking, more, carefully, are, we, aware, of, their, fat, tummies, and, chubby, legs, six, spiritelli, in, animated, conversation, crowd, at, the, top, of, the, large, classical, frame, of, his, cavalcanti, annunciation, in, santa, croce, florence, made, for, a, brother, in, law, of, the, medici, c, 1436, 1438, the, remarkable, bronze, statue, called, the, amore, attis, perhaps, from, the, early, 1440s, has, one, foot, in, the, world, of, the, spiritelli, and, the, other, in, the, sensuous, eroticism, of, the, bronze, david, the, figure, has, wings, and, a, tail, stands, on, a, snake, and, has, a, variety, of, classical, attributes, too, many, for, a, simple, identification, he, wears, leggings, that, emphasize, rather, than, hide, his, private, parts, in, the, 17th, century, it, was, taken, to, be, a, work, of, antiquity, despite, a, clear, description, of, it, by, vasari, donatello, s, bronze, david, now, in, the, bargello, museum, is, his, most, famous, work, and, the, first, known, free, standing, nude, statue, produced, since, antiquity, it, is, conceived, fully, in, the, round, independent, of, any, architectural, surroundings, and, nearly, at, life, size, although, the, commission, is, not, documented, the, statue, is, first, recorded, placed, on, a, column, in, the, courtyard, of, the, newly, built, palazzo, medici, at, a, wedding, in, 1469, but, it, probably, pre, dates, the, start, of, that, building, in, 1444, it, was, most, likely, commissioned, by, cosimo, de, medici, for, the, older, medici, palace, on, the, same, street, probably, between, 1434, and, 1440, after, donatello, returned, from, rome, and, cosimo, from, exile, david, was, well, established, as, a, symbol, of, the, republic, of, florence, victorious, in, defence, against, larger, surrounding, powers, with, at, this, period, the, duchy, of, milan, the, most, threatening, though, the, statue, certainly, was, intended, to, convey, this, meaning, it, also, has, a, sensuous, and, erotic, power, that, was, original, the, many, previous, florentine, images, of, david, like, donatello, s, stone, david, of, about, 1408, 09, showed, him, clothed, here, he, wears, only, a, hat, and, boots, which, as, with, the, amore, attys, serve, only, to, accentuate, his, nudity, donatello, s, innovation, is, the, transformation, of, the, king, of, israel, into, a, young, greek, god, in, a, work, of, almost, incredible, innovation, which, nothing, else, in, the, art, of, the, time, leads, us, to, anticipate, during, the, rest, of, the, century, in, continues, to, be, far, beyond, the, current, of, contemporary, taste, the, figure, shows, a, real, boy, whose, chest, was, narrower, and, flank, less, rounded, than, the, greek, ideal, and, the, waist, is, the, centre, of, plastic, interest, from, which, radiate, all, the, other, planes, of, the, body, which, became, the, norm, in, renaissance, nude, sculpture, one, foot, rests, casually, on, the, severed, head, of, goliath, giving, the, figure, a, contrapposto, pose, the, feathers, of, goliath, s, helmet, crest, brush, against, the, inside, of, david, s, thigh, in, a, further, sensuous, touch, the, david, and, the, amore, attis, supplement, various, pieces, of, contemporary, gossip, to, suggest, donatello, s, sexual, interests, it, seems, likely, that, donatello, s, homosexuality, was, well, known, and, tolerated, and, protected, by, the, medici, and, so, others, the, main, evidence, comes, from, anecdotes, in, the, detti, piacevoli, a, large, collection, of, celebrity, gossip, probably, compiled, around, 1480, but, not, published, until, 1548, perhaps, by, the, humanist, and, poet, angelo, poliziano, 1454, 1494, a, medici, insider, as, tutor, to, lorenzo, s, children, these, tell, of, donatello, surrounding, himself, with, handsome, assistants, and, chasing, in, search, of, one, that, had, fled, his, workshop, he, was, said, to, hire, especially, beautiful, boys, and, stained, them, probably, meaning, make, up, so, that, no, one, else, would, find, them, pleasing, when, one, assistant, left, after, a, quarrel, they, made, up, by, laughing, at, each, other, a, slang, term, for, sex, however, no, detail, is, known, with, certainty, about, his, private, life, and, unlike, many, artists, for, example, sandro, botticelli, there, are, no, recorded, denunciations, for, sodomy, in, the, florentine, archives, though, these, are, incomplete, wood, was, still, used, for, crucifixes, for, its, lightness, it, was, also, cheap, and, convenient, for, carrying, it, on, liturgical, processions, donatello, s, early, crucifix, for, santa, croce, has, lowerable, arms, for, this, purpose, wooden, sculptures, were, almost, always, painted, and, partly, gilded, as, terracotta, and, even, marble, and, bronze, often, were, when, a, florentine, confraternity, in, venice, commissioned, a, statue, of, john, the, baptist, patron, saint, of, florence, still, in, the, frari, church, there, wood, was, chosen, the, statue, is, probably, the, only, work, by, donatello, in, the, city, he, usually, did, not, sign, his, work, except, for, some, commissions, destined, for, outside, florence, the, baptist, was, signed, and, dated, 1438, before, this, was, revealed, in, conservation, work, it, had, been, dated, later, after, his, stay, in, padua, according, to, the, idea, that, donatello, s, works, became, more, and, more, expressive, the, redating, of, the, saint, john, had, knock, on, consequences, for, a, far, more, celebrated, wooden, figure, the, penitent, magdalene, long, in, the, florence, baptistery, now, museo, dell, opera, del, duomo, where, the, carving, style, is, comparable, this, is, formidably, expressive, in, a, stark, style, found, in, donatello, s, last, years, and, had, been, dated, to, around, 1456, until, the, date, was, found, on, the, other, figure, it, is, now, dated, generally, to, the, late, 1430s, or, at, any, rate, before, donatello, went, to, padua, according, to, kenneth, clark, it, shows, a, female, fakir, whose, small, sunken, eyes, gazing, across, the, desert, have, beheld, the, vision, of, god, her, body, is, no, longer, of, the, least, importance, to, her, in, 2020, the, painted, wooden, crucifix, of, the, church, of, sant, angelo, in, legnaia, a, suburb, of, florence, was, attributed, by, the, diocese, to, donatello, and, dated, to, the, 1460s, this, is, in, a, simpler, style, the, sagrestia, vecchia, as, it, is, now, called, of, san, lorenzo, florence, was, donatello, s, last, major, project, before, his, years, in, padua, and, forms, the, only, large, space, almost, wholly, decorated, by, him, opinions, have, varied, as, to, the, success, of, his, scheme, ever, since, the, various, parts, combine, experimentation, in, some, places, and, conservatism, in, others, and, the, whole, has, failed, to, achieve, the, iconic, status, of, the, rather, similar, pazzi, chapel, of, a, few, years, later, which, perhaps, learnt, the, lessons, of, the, sacristy, luca, della, robbia, was, the, sculptor, there, the, sacristy, was, newly, built, designed, by, brunelleschi, and, the, first, part, completed, of, a, major, reconstruction, of, the, church, by, the, medicis, it, combined, the, functions, of, a, medici, funerary, chapel, containing, the, tomb, of, giovanni, and, his, wife, under, the, vesting, table, for, the, vestments, to, be, laid, out, both, are, still, in, place, the, exact, dates, of, donatello, s, involvement, are, unclear, but, it, is, usually, placed, after, the, return, from, exile, of, the, medicis, in, 1434, and, donatello, s, departure, for, pisa, in, 1443, 44, probably, at, the, end, of, the, 1430s, donatello, s, additions, were, two, pairs, of, bronze, doors, with, relief, panels, and, elaborate, architectural, surrounds, for, them, and, two, sets, of, large, relief, roundels, below, the, main, dome, in, the, pendentives, are, four, scenes, from, the, life, of, john, the, baptist, and, at, the, top, of, the, purely, decorative, arches, in, pietra, serena, are, ones, of, the, four, evangelists, sitting, at, large, desks, on, which, their, attributes, perch, these, are, all, in, painted, stucco, the, evangelists, mostly, white, on, a, now, rather, muddy, blue, grey, background, with, gold, highlights, for, the, halos, three, of, the, scenes, from, john, s, life, have, many, small, figures, and, complicated, architectural, settings, and, backgrounds, while, the, fourth, set, on, patmos, has, a, landscape, background, all, use, a, colour, scheme, of, white, for, the, figures, different, shades, of, a, terracotta, brown, for, the, settings, and, the, muddy, blue, grey, for, the, sky, there, are, also, two, large, reliefs, of, pairs, of, standing, medici, patron, saints, over, the, doorways, in, the, same, technique, and, colours, in, different, places, the, stucco, was, painted, both, when, wet, in, a, kind, of, fresco, technique, and, when, dry, the, bronze, doors, were, relatively, small, and, had, a, stack, of, five, panels, on, each, door, each, containing, a, pair, of, standing, figures, on, a, plain, background, a, conservative, design, possibly, influenced, by, early, christian, art, such, as, the, doors, of, santa, sabina, in, rome, or, consular, diptychs, one, pair, has, the, twelve, apostles, with, other, saints, making, up, the, numbers, and, the, other, has, martyrs, who, in, most, cases, cannot, be, confidently, identified, the, execution, is, again, uneven, with, much, probably, done, by, assistants, the, scheme, received, criticism, by, now, rather, unusual, for, donatello, from, very, early, on, the, modelling, and, execution, of, some, of, the, reliefs, was, crude, especially, the, scenes, from, john, s, life, and, it, is, often, thought, that, the, various, added, elements, distract, from, the, simplicity, and, harmony, of, the, architecture, the, level, of, detail, in, the, higher, reliefs, makes, them, simply, hard, for, the, viewer, to, read, from, below, according, to, antonio, manetti, brunelleschi, s, biographer, donatello, did, not, consult, the, architect, about, the, additions, to, the, doorways, at, all, such, was, his, pride, and, arrogance, filarete, perhaps, echoing, a, comment, by, alberti, wrote, that, the, paired, figures, on, the, doors, looked, like, fencers, he, referred, to, the, apostle, doors, though, the, remark, is, more, fairly, applied, to, the, martyrs, most, of, whom, hold, thin, palm, fronds, we, do, not, know, how, donatello, felt, about, his, finished, scheme, but, he, never, used, painted, stucco, again, nor, did, anyone, much, else, as, within, a, few, years, the, della, robbia, workshop, had, perfected, painted, and, glazed, terracotta, in, large, pieces, as, in, the, pazzi, chapel, which, was, clearly, the, better, technique, the, reception, of, the, scheme, has, been, suggested, as, a, factor, in, donatello, s, readiness, to, abandon, florence, for, a, long, period, in, 1443, donatello, was, called, to, padua, by, the, heirs, of, the, famous, condottiere, erasmo, da, narni, better, known, as, the, gattamelata, or, honey, cat, who, had, died, that, year, designing, and, planning, his, equestrian, monument, of, gattamelata, probably, began, that, year, or, the, next, with, the, casting, mostly, done, in, 1447, or, 1448, and, the, bronze, work, finished, in, 1450, although, it, was, not, installed, on, its, high, stone, pedestal, until, 1453, padua, was, a, prosperous, city, with, a, university, long, under, the, control, of, venice, and, generally, friendly, to, the, medici, and, their, artists, cosimo, had, almost, certainly, given, his, blessing, to, donatello, s, stay, the, commission, is, slightly, mysterious, gattamelata, s, will, specified, a, relatively, modest, tomb, inside, the, church, where, he, was, indeed, buried, it, was, unexpected, that, the, venetian, government, then, ordered, a, grand, public, monument, for, a, general, who, had, served, them, for, less, than, a, decade, with, rather, mixed, success, the, cost, which, must, have, been, enormous, was, shared, by, the, venetian, government, and, the, family, executors, who, handled, the, works, but, it, is, not, clear, in, what, proportions, a, factor, may, have, been, a, competing, commission, in, nearby, ferrara, for, an, equestrian, statue, of, niccol, iii, d, este, marquis, of, ferrara, another, condottiere, by, two, florentine, sculptors, one, a, pupil, of, donatello, this, was, slightly, smaller, than, life, size, with, the, marquis, in, civilian, dress, rather, than, armour, he, had, died, at, the, end, of, 1441, and, the, monument, was, in, place, by, 1451, before, being, destroyed, by, the, french, in, 1796, a, replica, is, now, in, place, the, gattamelata, was, placed, on, the, square, outside, the, basilica, of, st, anthony, a, famous, pilgrimage, church, locally, called, il, santo, in, ground, then, used, as, a, cemetery, as, with, other, works, outside, florence, it, was, signed, it, is, the, first, life, size, equestrian, statue, since, antiquity, donatello, may, have, seen, the, regisole, at, ravenna, a, late, roman, example, which, was, another, victim, of, the, french, and, he, certainly, knew, the, equestrian, statue, of, marcus, aurelius, c, 175, in, rome, donatello, s, work, is, strongly, classicising, with, roman, motifs, on, the, armour, and, saddle, almost, impossible, to, see, in, situ, and, the, horse, perhaps, derived, from, the, ancient, horses, of, saint, mark, in, venice, andrea, del, caldiere, a, paduan, metalworker, led, the, team, doing, the, actual, casting, for, this, and, his, other, paduan, bronzes, other, equestrian, statues, from, the, 14th, century, had, not, been, executed, in, bronze, and, had, been, placed, over, tombs, rather, than, erected, independently, in, a, public, place, this, work, became, the, prototype, for, other, equestrian, monuments, executed, in, italy, and, europe, in, the, following, centuries, donatello, was, based, in, padua, for, ten, years, though, he, returned, to, florence, soon, after, the, gattamelata, was, finally, in, place, in, 1453, he, had, a, studio, near, the, santo, and, several, assistants, decades, later, padua, was, for, some, time, the, leading, italian, centre, for, small, table, bronzes, which, was, probably, partly, a, legacy, of, the, stimulus, given, by, donatello, s, visit, he, did, not, stay, in, the, city, the, whole, time, and, he, is, documented, in, florence, at, some, points, and, in, 1450, is, recorded, visiting, mantua, and, modena, for, commissions, that, never, came, off, in, 1451, he, was, paid, by, the, bishop, of, ferrara, for, a, work, he, never, finished, in, padua, itself, he, completed, several, works, for, il, santo, including, the, first, life, sized, bronze, crucifix, with, a, wooden, cross, 1444, 1449, which, originally, hung, well, down, the, nave, in, 1895, it, was, moved, to, hang, over, the, high, altar, for, which, donatello, had, made, a, bronze, enthroned, virgin, and, child, and, six, flanking, saints, constituting, a, holy, conversation, and, a, total, of, twenty, one, bronze, reliefs, and, one, in, marble, an, entombment, all, these, were, begun, in, 1446, and, nearly, complete, by, june, 1450, though, some, of, the, statues, seem, not, quite, finished, and, other, sculptors, seem, to, have, done, some, of, the, work, the, four, reliefs, of, scenes, from, the, life, of, saint, anthony, with, highlights, in, gold, are, of, a, uniform, high, standard, after, more, than, one, rearrangement, the, first, in, 1582, the, original, disposition, of, the, statues, is, uncertain, but, they, were, probably, closer, together, in, one, row, than, they, are, now, with, two, now, placed, on, a, railing, below, and, forward, of, the, others, the, madonna, and, child, enthroned, between, st, francis, and, st, anthony, in, bronze, c, 1448, portrays, the, christ, child, being, displayed, to, the, faithful, by, the, madonna, who, wears, a, crown, the, madonna, is, neither, standing, nor, sitting, on, the, throne, but, is, portrayed, in, the, act, of, rising, she, is, flanked, by, two, saints, anthony, of, padua, and, francis, of, assisi, shown, at, the, base, of, her, throne, to, each, side, of, the, madonna, are, sphinxes, allegorical, figures, of, knowledge, on, the, throne, s, back, is, a, relief, of, the, fall, of, man, depicting, adam, and, eve, between, 1457, and, 1461, donatello, was, active, in, and, for, siena, though, he, was, now, aging, and, perhaps, mostly, contributed, designs, and, modelli, rather, than, carving, much, himself, at, least, in, stone, in, 1457, he, had, received, three, large, commissions, for, the, city, of, which, only, one, reached, siena, firstly, there, were, bronze, doors, for, the, cathedral, of, which, only, a, possible, trial, cast, of, one, panel, survives, in, the, victoria, and, albert, museum, the, sienese, may, have, been, unable, to, fund, what, would, have, been, a, very, expensive, project, his, bronze, judith, and, holofernes, is, an, important, late, work, which, ended, in, a, medici, courtyard, in, florence, while, his, bronze, john, the, baptist, was, delivered, minus, a, forearm, and, is, now, in, siena, cathedral, another, commission, was, a, large, relief, madonna, and, child, madonna, delle, grazie, with, blue, glass, inlays, in, the, surround, completed, in, 1459, with, much, of, the, work, done, by, another, perhaps, the, local, urbano, da, cortona, who, had, been, pushed, aside, to, allow, donatello, to, have, the, commission, the, signed, judith, and, holofernes, is, in, his, late, stark, style, showing, the, killing, in, progress, with, judith, about, to, strike, a, second, blow, relief, scenes, on, the, triangular, base, seem, to, show, the, drunken, feast, and, revels, that, preceded, the, killing, in, a, final, outing, for, donatello, s, sensual, mode, however, most, of, the, younger, revellers, have, wings, donatello, used, real, cloth, to, give, texture, in, some, of, the, modelling, and, perhaps, holofernes, legs, were, moulded, from, a, live, model, it, may, have, been, planned, as, a, fountain, as, there, are, spouts, at, the, corners, of, the, base, though, there, now, seems, to, be, no, internal, plumbing, when, the, medici, were, expelled, in, 1494, it, and, the, bronze, david, were, moved, to, the, palazzo, della, signoria, the, medici, were, now, intended, to, be, seen, as, the, tyrannical, victims, rather, than, the, liberating, underdogs, after, returning, from, siena, he, remained, in, florence, until, his, death, in, 1466, he, was, evidently, unable, to, work, for, a, period, of, uncertain, extent, before, his, death, vasari, records, this, but, without, any, timing, but, with, the, help, of, assistants, he, embarked, on, a, major, project, in, these, years, reliefs, that, now, form, two, pulpits, for, san, lorenzo, florence, the, burial, place, of, the, medicis, though, it, is, possible, that, this, was, not, the, function, originally, intended, they, were, only, assembled, in, this, way, in, the, following, century, and, the, panel, sizes, vary, at, least, the, designs, of, most, of, these, are, thought, to, have, by, donatello, himself, and, the, modelling, of, many, parts, the, precise, attribution, of, the, reliefs, remains, much, discussed, some, appear, to, have, been, cast, from, unfinished, modelli, and, there, is, considerable, stylistic, disparity, between, panels, and, sometimes, sections, of, the, same, panel, the, treatment, of, the, spaces, in, which, the, scenes, are, set, is, especially, varied, and, experimental, part, of, the, absolutely, uncompromising, use, of, every, possible, means, to, express, emotion, and, suffering, that, marks, these, works, donatello, s, inventiveness, and, search, for, new, effects, is, shown, by, his, various, mostly, novel, uses, of, glass, a, material, hardly, used, in, european, sculpture, before, he, was, commissioned, to, design, stained, glass, for, florence, cathedral, around, 1434, a, conventional, task, but, one, usually, given, to, a, painter, rather, than, a, sculptor, he, used, glass, in, tesserae, form, in, the, backgrounds, of, reliefs, including, the, prato, pulpit, and, cantoria, reliefs, which, was, an, old, style, but, his, background, of, a, network, of, roundels, with, glass, covered, wax, and, gold, inlays, for, the, terracotta, piot, madonna, louvre, c, 1440, or, later, is, original, his, chellini, madonna, c, 1450, victoria, and, albert, museum, is, a, round, bronze, relief, 28, 5, cm, across, which, is, cast, at, an, even, thickness, meaning, that, the, reverse, has, an, intaglio, concave, image, matching, the, convex, relief, one, on, the, front, this, seems, to, have, been, intended, to, be, used, as, a, mould, for, molten, glass, and, perhaps, other, materials, donatello, gave, it, to, his, doctor, and, friend, giovanni, chellini, in, 1456, though, it, was, probably, not, new, at, that, point, other, than, tomb, effigies, there, is, no, sculpture, by, donatello, that, is, certainly, intended, to, be, a, portrait, some, of, his, early, statues, of, prophets, for, the, cathedral, were, said, to, use, the, features, of, specific, individuals, donatello, probably, never, saw, gattamelata, alive, and, may, not, have, had, any, good, image, to, work, from, his, figure, seems, to, have, a, generalized, caesar, like, head, and, is, no, portrait, in, the, usual, sense, but, an, idealized, portrait, of, brute, power, during, donatello, s, career, the, distinctive, florentine, flat, bottomed, bust, portrait, became, established, and, popular, among, the, city, s, elite, led, by, the, medici, donatello, is, only, associated, with, one, example, but, this, may, be, the, earliest, niccol, da, uzzano, was, a, significant, medici, political, associate, as, well, as, a, banker, and, humanist, who, died, in, 1431, the, painted, terracotta, bust, portrait, of, him, may, have, been, made, using, a, life, or, death, mask, presumably, not, very, long, after, his, death, at, the, latest, he, is, shown, wearing, an, ancient, roman, toga, with, uncompromising, realism, but, an, expression, that, exudes, sagacious, strength, and, nobility, however, the, attribution, to, donatello, the, dating, and, foremost, the, quality, of, the, bust, itself, are, disputed, giorgio, vasari, s, life, of, donatello, in, his, lives, of, the, artists, was, mostly, researched, in, the, 1540s, around, a, century, after, the, events, he, recounts, and, contains, some, clear, and, significant, errors, of, fact, it, fully, recognises, donatello, s, stature, as, an, artist, and, lists, many, works, his, knowledge, of, those, in, padua, and, siena, appears, shaky, and, may, rely, on, the, accounts, of, others, in, his, life, of, raphael, he, praises, the, beautiful, fancy, bel, capriccio, of, some, figures, which, vasari, himself, later, drew, on, but, he, is, evidently, unaware, that, raphael, took, them, from, a, donatello, church, relief, in, padua, he, also, places, donatello, s, birth, in, 1403, some, seventeen, years, after, better, informed, modern, scholars, aware, of, the, record, of, the, assault, in, 1401, and, payments, for, work, going, back, to, 1406, vasari, a, fierce, florentine, patriot, saw, donatello, as, the, start, of, florentine, dominance, in, renaissance, sculpture, and, traced, a, line, of, succession, between, him, and, his, hero, michelangelo, via, the, somewhat, dubious, link, of, bertoldo, di, giovanni, d, 1491, a, pupil, of, donatello, and, in, theory, michelangelo, s, mentor, when, he, ran, the, informal, garden, academy, of, lorenzo, de, medici, at, the, end, of, his, life, vasari, stressed, the, close, ties, between, donatello, and, the, medici, which, were, certainly, important, in, his, life, but, also, mirrored, those, michelangelo, and, vasari, himself, enjoyed, donatello, s, output, was, so, varied, and, individual, that, his, influence, can, be, seen, in, all, florentine, sculpture, in, the, 15th, century, and, well, beyond, florence, but, he, shared, important, elements, of, his, style, in, particular, his, revival, of, classical, forms, and, styles, with, the, other, outstanding, sculptors, of, his, generation, ghiberti, jacopo, della, quercia, luca, della, robbia, and, others, many, younger, sculptors, assisted, him, though, his, workshop, relationships, are, not, very, well, documented, and, recent, scholarship, has, cast, doubt, on, many, 19th, century, claims, some, from, vasari, of, other, sculptors, as, pupils, of, donatello, regular, assistants, in, donatello, s, later, years, included, bartolomeo, bellano, from, padua, and, bertoldo, di, giovanni, when, he, died, the, sweet, style, that, he, had, helped, to, produce, decades, before, dominated, in, the, work, of, florentine, sculptors, his, late, style, with, its, boldness, of, imagination, and, execution, probably, overawed, them, and, seemed, incomprehensible, and, inaccessible, only, many, years, later, did, verrocchio, and, antonio, del, pollaiuolo, explore, similar, expressive, effects, his, periods, in, padua, and, siena, left, behind, trained, bronze, founders, and, sculptors, who, made, these, cities, especially, padua, significant, centres, in, their, own, right, indeed, in, padua, his, presence, had, a, great, effect, on, local, painting, also, bartolomeo, bellano, was, back, in, padua, by, 1469, and, remained, the, leading, sculptor, there, handing, the, role, over, to, his, pupil, andrea, riccio, c, 1470, 1532, in, due, course, desiderio, da, settignano, may, have, acted, as, a, younger, colleague, and, was, the, main, other, sculptor, who, could, execute, shallow, reliefs, in, a, way, comparable, to, donatello, he, died, in, 1464, at, just, 34, cutting, off, a, very, promising, career, the, shallow, relief, style, was, not, much, used, by, other, sculptors, though, michelangelo, s, early, madonna, of, the, stairs, c, 1490, is, an, essay, in, it, michelangelo, s, david, 1501, is, both, an, ode, and, a, challenge, to, donatello, most, of, donatello, s,
