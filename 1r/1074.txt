of, mali, s, power, and, prestige, one, of, the, richest, people, in, history, he, is, known, to, have, been, enormously, wealthy, described, as, being, inconceivably, rich, by, contemporaries, time,

principally, from, the, mali, empire, controlling, and, taxing, the, trade, in, salt, from, northern, regions, and, especially, from, gold, panned, and, mined, in, the, gold, rich, regions, to, the, south, bambuk, wangara, bure, galam, taghaza, and, other, such, kingdoms, over, many, centuries, over, a, very, long, period, mali, had, created, a, large, reserve, of, gold, mali, is, also, suspected, to, have, been, involved, in, the, trade, in, many, goods, such, as, ivory, slaves, spices, silks, and, ceramics, however, presently, little, is, known, about, the, extent, or, mechanics, of, these, trades, at, the, time, of, musa, s, ascension, to, the, throne, mali, in, large, part, consisted, of, the, territory, of, the, former, ghana, empire, which, mali, had, conquered, the, mali, empire, consisted, of, land, that, is, now, part, of, guinea, senegal, mauritania, the, gambia, and, the, modern, state, of, mali, musa, went, on, hajj, to, mecca, in, 1324, traveling, with, an, enormous, entourage, and, a, vast, supply, of, gold, en, route, he, spent, time, in, cairo, where, his, lavish, gift, giving, is, said, to, have, noticeably, affected, the, value, of, gold, in, egypt, and, garnered, the, attention, of, the, wider, muslim, world, musa, expanded, the, borders, of, the, mali, empire, in, particular, incorporating, the, cities, of, gao, and, timbuktu, into, its, territory, he, sought, closer, ties, with, the, rest, of, the, muslim, world, particularly, the, mamluk, and, marinid, sultanates, he, recruited, scholars, from, the, wider, muslim, world, to, travel, to, mali, such, as, the, andalusian, poet, abu, ishaq, al, sahili, and, helped, establish, timbuktu, as, a, center, of, islamic, learning, his, reign, is, associated, with, numerous, construction, projects, including, a, portion, of, djinguereber, mosque, in, timbuktu, mansa, musa, s, personal, name, was, musa, arabic, romanized, m, s, the, name, of, moses, in, islam, mansa, ruler, or, king, in, mand, was, the, title, of, the, ruler, of, the, mali, empire, in, oral, tradition, and, the, timbuktu, chronicles, musa, is, further, known, as, kanku, musa, in, mand, tradition, it, was, common, for, one, s, name, to, be, prefixed, by, their, mother, s, name, so, the, name, kanku, musa, means, musa, son, of, kanku, although, it, is, unclear, if, the, genealogy, implied, is, literal, he, is, also, called, hiji, mansa, musa, in, oral, tradition, because, he, made, hajj, al, yafii, gave, musa, s, name, as, musa, ibn, abi, bakr, ibn, abi, al, aswad, arabic, romanized, m, s, ibn, ab, bakr, ibn, ab, al, aswad, and, ibn, hajar, gave, musa, s, name, as, musa, ibn, abi, bakr, salim, al, takruri, in, the, songhai, language, rulers, of, mali, such, as, musa, were, known, as, the, mali, koi, koi, being, a, title, that, conveyed, authority, over, a, region, in, other, words, the, ruler, of, mali, much, of, what, is, known, about, musa, comes, from, arabic, sources, written, after, his, hajj, especially, the, writings, of, al, umari, and, ibn, khaldun, while, in, cairo, during, his, hajj, musa, befriended, officials, such, as, ibn, amir, hajib, who, learned, about, him, and, his, country, from, him, and, later, passed, on, that, information, to, historians, such, as, al, umari, additional, information, comes, from, two, 17th, century, manuscripts, written, in, timbuktu, the, tarikh, ibn, al, mukhtar, and, the, tarikh, al, sudan, oral, tradition, as, performed, by, the, jeliw, sg, jeli, also, known, as, griots, includes, relatively, little, information, about, musa, compared, to, some, other, parts, of, the, history, of, mali, genealogy, of, the, mansas, of, the, mali, empire, up, to, magha, ii, d, c, 1389, based, on, levtzion, s, interpretation, of, ibn, khaldun, numbered, individuals, reigned, as, mansa, the, numbers, indicate, the, order, in, which, they, reigned, musa, s, father, was, named, faga, leye, and, his, mother, may, have, been, named, kanku, faga, leye, was, the, son, of, abu, bakr, a, brother, of, sunjata, the, first, mansa, of, the, mali, empire, ibn, battuta, who, visited, mali, during, the, reign, of, musa, s, brother, sulayman, said, that, musa, s, grandfather, was, named, sariq, jata, sariq, jata, may, be, another, name, for, sunjata, who, was, actually, musa, s, great, uncle, the, date, of, musa, s, birth, is, unknown, but, he, still, appeared, to, be, a, young, man, in, 1324, the, tarikh, al, fattash, claims, that, musa, accidentally, killed, kanku, at, some, point, prior, to, his, hajj, musa, ascended, to, power, in, the, early, 1300s, under, unclear, circumstances, according, to, musa, s, own, account, his, predecessor, as, mansa, of, mali, presumably, muhammad, ibn, qu, launched, two, expeditions, to, explore, the, atlantic, ocean, 200, ships, for, the, first, exploratory, mission, and, 2, 000, ships, for, the, second, the, mansa, led, the, second, expedition, himself, and, appointed, musa, as, his, deputy, to, rule, the, empire, until, he, returned, when, he, did, not, return, musa, was, crowned, as, mansa, himself, marking, a, transfer, of, the, line, of, succession, from, the, descendants, of, sunjata, to, the, descendants, of, his, brother, abu, bakr, some, modern, historians, have, cast, doubt, on, musa, s, version, of, events, suggesting, he, may, have, deposed, his, predecessor, and, devised, the, story, about, the, voyage, to, explain, how, he, took, power, nonetheless, the, possibility, of, such, a, voyage, has, been, taken, seriously, by, several, historians, according, to, the, tarikh, al, fattash, musa, had, a, wife, named, inari, konte, her, jamu, clan, name, konte, is, shared, with, both, sunjata, s, mother, sogolon, konte, and, his, arch, enemy, sumanguru, konte, musa, was, a, young, man, when, he, became, mansa, possibly, in, his, early, twenties, given, the, grandeur, of, his, subsequent, hajj, it, is, likely, that, musa, spent, much, of, his, early, reign, preparing, for, it, among, these, preparations, would, likely, have, been, raids, to, capture, and, enslave, people, from, neighboring, lands, as, musa, s, entourage, would, include, many, thousands, of, slaves, the, historian, michael, gomez, estimates, that, mali, may, have, captured, over, 6, 000, slaves, per, year, for, this, purpose, perhaps, because, of, this, musa, s, early, reign, was, spent, in, continuous, military, conflict, with, neighboring, non, muslim, societies, in, 1324, while, in, cairo, musa, said, that, he, had, conquered, 24, cities, and, their, surrounding, districts, musa, was, a, muslim, and, his, hajj, or, pilgrimage, to, mecca, made, him, well, known, across, north, africa, and, the, middle, east, to, musa, islam, was, an, entry, into, the, cultured, world, of, the, eastern, mediterranean, he, would, have, spent, much, time, fostering, the, growth, of, the, religion, within, his, empire, when, musa, departed, mali, for, the, hajj, he, left, his, son, muhammad, to, rule, in, his, absence, musa, made, his, pilgrimage, between, 1324, and, 1325, spanning, 2700, miles, his, procession, reportedly, included, 60, 000, men, all, wearing, brocade, and, persian, silk, including, 12, 000, slaves, who, each, carried, 1, 8, kg, 4, lb, of, gold, bars, and, heralds, dressed, in, silks, bearing, gold, staffs, organized, horses, and, handled, bags, musa, provided, all, necessities, for, the, procession, feeding, the, entire, company, of, men, and, animals, those, animals, included, 80, camels, which, each, carried, 23, 136, kg, 50, 300, lb, of, gold, dust, musa, gave, the, gold, to, the, poor, he, met, along, his, route, musa, not, only, gave, to, the, cities, he, passed, on, the, way, to, mecca, including, cairo, and, medina, but, also, traded, gold, for, souvenirs, it, was, reported, that, he, built, a, mosque, every, friday, shihab, al, din, al, umari, who, visited, cairo, shortly, after, musa, s, pilgrimage, to, mecca, noted, that, it, was, a, lavish, display, of, power, wealth, and, unprecedented, by, its, size, and, pageantry, musa, made, a, major, point, of, showing, off, his, nation, s, wealth, musa, and, his, entourage, arrived, at, the, outskirts, of, cairo, in, july, 1324, they, camped, for, three, days, by, the, pyramids, of, giza, before, crossing, the, nile, into, cairo, on, 19, july, while, in, cairo, musa, met, with, the, mamluk, sultan, al, nasir, muhammad, whose, reign, had, already, seen, one, mansa, sakura, make, the, hajj, al, nasir, expected, musa, to, prostrate, himself, before, him, which, musa, initially, refused, to, do, when, he, did, finally, bow, he, said, he, was, doing, so, for, god, alone, despite, this, initial, awkwardness, the, two, rulers, got, along, well, and, exchanged, gifts, musa, and, his, entourage, gave, and, spent, freely, while, in, cairo, musa, stayed, in, the, qarafa, district, of, cairo, and, befriended, its, governor, ibn, amir, hajib, who, learned, much, about, mali, from, him, musa, stayed, in, cairo, for, three, months, departing, on, 18, october, with, the, official, caravan, to, mecca, musa, s, generosity, continued, as, he, traveled, onward, to, mecca, and, he, gave, gifts, to, fellow, pilgrims, and, the, people, of, medina, and, mecca, while, in, mecca, conflict, broke, out, between, a, group, of, malian, pilgrims, and, a, group, of, turkic, pilgrims, in, the, masjid, al, haram, swords, were, drawn, but, before, the, situation, escalated, further, musa, persuaded, his, men, to, back, down, musa, and, his, entourage, lingered, in, mecca, after, the, last, day, of, the, hajj, traveling, separately, from, the, main, caravan, their, return, journey, to, cairo, was, struck, by, catastrophe, by, the, time, they, reached, suez, many, of, the, malian, pilgrims, had, died, of, cold, starvation, or, bandit, raids, and, they, had, lost, many, of, their, supplies, having, run, out, of, money, musa, and, his, entourage, were, forced, to, borrow, money, and, resell, much, of, what, they, had, purchased, while, in, cairo, before, the, hajj, and, musa, went, into, debt, to, several, merchants, such, as, siraj, al, din, however, al, nasir, muhammad, returned, musa, s, earlier, show, of, generosity, with, gifts, of, his, own, on, his, return, journey, musa, met, the, andalusi, poet, abu, ishaq, al, sahili, whose, eloquence, and, knowledge, of, jurisprudence, impressed, him, and, whom, he, convinced, to, travel, with, him, to, mali, other, scholars, musa, brought, to, mali, included, maliki, jurists, according, to, the, tarikh, al, sudan, the, cities, of, gao, and, timbuktu, submitted, to, musa, s, rule, as, he, traveled, through, on, his, return, to, mali, according, to, one, account, given, by, ibn, khaldun, musa, s, general, saghmanja, conquered, gao, the, other, account, claims, that, gao, had, been, conquered, during, the, reign, of, mansa, sakura, both, of, these, accounts, may, be, true, as, mali, s, control, of, gao, may, have, been, weak, requiring, powerful, mansas, to, reassert, their, authority, periodically, musa, embarked, on, a, large, building, program, raising, mosques, and, madrasas, in, timbuktu, and, gao, most, notably, the, ancient, center, of, learning, sankore, madrasah, or, university, of, sankore, was, constructed, during, his, reign, in, niani, musa, built, the, hall, of, audience, a, building, communicating, by, an, interior, door, to, the, royal, palace, it, was, an, admirable, monument, surmounted, by, a, dome, and, adorned, with, arabesques, of, striking, colours, the, wooden, window, frames, of, an, upper, storey, were, plated, with, silver, foil, those, of, a, lower, storey, with, gold, like, the, great, mosque, a, contemporaneous, and, grandiose, structure, in, timbuktu, the, hall, was, built, of, cut, stone, during, this, period, there, was, an, advanced, level, of, urban, living, in, the, major, centers, of, mali, sergio, domian, an, italian, scholar, of, art, and, architecture, wrote, of, this, period, thus, was, laid, the, foundation, of, an, urban, civilization, at, the, height, of, its, power, mali, had, at, least, 400, cities, and, the, interior, of, the, niger, delta, was, very, densely, populated, it, is, recorded, that, mansa, musa, traveled, through, the, cities, of, timbuktu, and, gao, on, his, way, to, mecca, and, made, them, a, part, of, his, empire, when, he, returned, around, 1325, he, brought, architects, from, andalusia, a, region, in, spain, and, cairo, to, build, his, grand, palace, in, timbuktu, and, the, great, djinguereber, mosque, that, still, stands, timbuktu, soon, became, the, center, of, trade, culture, and, islam, markets, brought, in, merchants, from, hausaland, egypt, and, other, african, kingdoms, a, university, was, founded, in, the, city, as, well, as, in, the, malian, cities, of, djenn, and, s, gou, and, islam, was, spread, through, the, markets, and, university, making, timbuktu, a, new, area, for, islamic, scholarship, news, of, the, malian, empire, s, city, of, wealth, even, traveled, across, the, mediterranean, to, southern, europe, where, traders, from, venice, granada, and, genoa, soon, added, timbuktu, to, their, maps, to, trade, manufactured, goods, for, gold, the, university, of, sankore, in, timbuktu, was, restaffed, under, musa, s, reign, with, jurists, astronomers, and, mathematicians, the, university, became, a, center, of, learning, and, culture, drawing, muslim, scholars, from, around, africa, and, the, middle, east, to, timbuktu, in, 1330, the, kingdom, of, mossi, invaded, and, conquered, the, city, of, timbuktu, gao, had, already, been, captured, by, musa, s, general, and, musa, quickly, regained, timbuktu, built, a, rampart, and, stone, fort, and, placed, a, standing, army, to, protect, the, city, from, future, invaders, while, musa, s, palace, has, since, vanished, the, university, and, mosque, still, stand, in, timbuktu, the, date, of, mansa, musa, s, death, is, uncertain, using, the, reign, lengths, reported, by, ibn, khaldun, to, calculate, back, from, the, death, of, mansa, suleyman, in, 1360, musa, would, have, died, in, 1332, however, ibn, khaldun, also, reports, that, musa, sent, an, envoy, to, congratulate, abu, al, hasan, ali, for, his, conquest, of, tlemcen, which, took, place, in, may, 1337, but, by, the, time, abu, al, hasan, sent, an, envoy, in, response, musa, had, died, and, suleyman, was, on, the, throne, suggesting, musa, died, in, 1337, in, contrast, al, umari, writing, twelve, years, after, musa, s, hajj, in, approximately, 1337, claimed, that, musa, returned, to, mali, intending, to, abdicate, and, return, to, live, in, mecca, but, died, before, he, could, do, so, suggesting, he, died, even, earlier, than, 1332, it, is, possible, that, it, was, actually, musa, s, son, maghan, who, congratulated, abu, al, hasan, or, maghan, who, received, abu, al, hasan, s, envoy, after, musa, s, death, the, latter, possibility, is, corroborated, by, ibn, khaldun, calling, suleyman, musa, s, son, in, that, passage, suggesting, he, may, have, confused, musa, s, brother, suleyman, with, musa, s, son, maghan, alternatively, it, is, possible, that, the, four, year, reign, ibn, khaldun, credits, maghan, with, actually, referred, to, his, ruling, mali, while, musa, was, away, on, the, hajj, and, he, only, reigned, briefly, in, his, own, right, nehemia, levtzion, regarded, 1337, as, the, most, likely, date, which, has, been, accepted, by, other, scholars, musa, s, reign, is, commonly, regarded, as, mali, s, golden, age, but, this, perception, may, be, the, result, of, his, reign, being, the, best, recorded, by, arabic, sources, rather, than, him, necessarily, being, the, wealthiest, and, most, powerful, mansa, of, mali, the, territory, of, the, mali, empire, was, at, its, height, during, the, reigns, of, musa, and, his, brother, sulayman, and, covered, the, sudan, sahel, region, of, west, africa, musa, is, less, renowned, in, mand, oral, tradition, as, performed, by, the, jeliw, he, is, criticized, for, being, unfaithful, to, tradition, and, some, of, the, jeliw, regard, musa, as, having, wasted, mali, s, wealth, however, some, aspects, of, musa, appear, to, have, been, incorporated, into, a, figure, in, mand, oral, tradition, known, as, fajigi, which, translates, as, father, of, hope, fajigi, is, remembered, as, having, traveled, to, mecca, to, retrieve, ceremonial, objects, known, as, boliw, which, feature, in, mand, traditional, religion, as, fajigi, musa, is, sometimes, conflated, with, a, figure, in, oral, tradition, named, fakoli, who, is, best, known, as, sunjata, s, top, general, the, figure, of, fajigi, combines, both, islam, and, traditional, beliefs, the, name, musa, has, become, virtually, synonymous, with, pilgrimage, in, mand, tradition, such, that, other, figures, who, are, remembered, as, going, on, a, pilgrimage, such, as, fakoli, are, also, called, musa, mansa, musa, is, renowned, for, his, wealth, and, generosity, online, articles, in, the, 21st, century, have, claimed, that, mansa, musa, was, the, richest, person, of, all, time, historians, such, as, hadrien, collet, have, argued, that, musa, s, wealth, is, impossible, to, accurately, calculate, contemporary, arabic, sources, may, have, been, trying, to, express, that, musa, had, more, gold, than, they, thought, possible, rather, than, trying, to, give, an, exact, number, furthermore, it, is, difficult, to, meaningfully, compare, the, wealth, of, historical, figures, such, as, mansa, musa, due, to, the, difficulty, of, separating, the, personal, wealth, of, a, monarch, from, the, wealth, of, the, state, and, the, difficulty, of, comparing, wealth, in, highly, different, societies, musa, may, have, brought, as, much, as, 18, tons, of, gold, on, his, hajj, equal, in, value, to, over, us, 957, million, in, 2022, musa, himself, further, promoted, the, appearance, of, having, vast, inexhaustible, wealth, by, spreading, rumors, that, gold, grew, like, a, plant, in, his, kingdom, according, to, some, arabic, writers, musa, s, gift, giving, caused, a, depreciation, in, the, value, of, gold, in, egypt, al, umari, said, that, before, musa, s, arrival, a, mithqal, of, gold, was, worth, 25, silver, dirhams, but, that, it, dropped, to, less, than, 22, dirhams, afterward, and, did, not, go, above, that, number, for, at, least, twelve, years, though, this, has, been, described, as, having, wrecked, egypt, s, economy, the, historian, warren, schultz, has, argued, that, this, was, well, within, normal, fluctuations, in, the, value, of, gold, in, mamluk, egypt, the, wealth, of, the, mali, empire, did, not, come, from, direct, control, of, gold, producing, regions, but, rather, trade, and, tribute, the, gold, musa, brought, on, his, pilgrimage, probably, represented, years, of, accumulated, tribute, that, musa, would, have, spent, much, of, his, early, reign, gathering, another, source, of, income, for, mali, during, musa, s, reign, was, taxation, of, the, copper, trade, according, to, several, contemporary, authors, such, as, ibn, battuta, ibn, al, dawadari, and, al, umari, mansa, musa, ran, out, of, money, during, his, journey, to, mecca, and, had, to, borrow, from, egyptian, merchants, at, a, high, rate, of, interest, on, his, return, journey, al, umari, and, ibn, khaldun, state, that, the, moneylenders, were, either, never, repaid, or, only, partly, repaid, other, sources, disagree, as, to, whether, they, were, eventually, and, fully, compensated, arabic, writers, such, as, ibn, battuta, and, abdallah, ibn, asad, al, yafii, praised, musa, s, generosity, virtue, and, intelligence, ibn, khaldun, said, that, he, was, an, upright, man, and, a, great, king, and, tales, of, his, justice, are, still, told
