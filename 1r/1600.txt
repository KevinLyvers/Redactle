aryabhata, iso, ryabha, a, or, aryabhata, i, 476, 550, ce, was, the, first, of, the, major, mathematician, astronomers, from, the, classical, age, of, indian, mathematics, and, indian, astronomy, his, works, include, the, ryabha, ya, which, mentions, that, in, 3600, kali, yuga, 499, ce, he, was, 23, years, old, and, the, arya, siddhanta, for, his, explicit, mention, of, the, relativity, of, motion, he, also, qualifies, as, a, major, early, physicist, while, there, is, a, tendency, to, misspell, his, name, as, aryabhatta, by, analogy, with, other, names, having, the, bhatta, suffix, his, name, is, properly, spelled, aryabhata, every, astronomical, text, spells, his, name, thus, including, brahmagupta, s, references, to, him, in, more, than, a, hundred, places, by, name, furthermore, in, most, instances, aryabhatta, would, not, fit, the, metre, either, aryabhata, mentions, in, the, aryabhatiya, that, he, was, 23, years, old, 3, 600, years, into, the, kali, yuga, but, this, is, not, to, mean, that, the, text, was, composed, at, that, time, this, mentioned, year, corresponds, to, 499, ce, and, implies, that, he, was, born, in, 476, aryabhata, called, himself, a, native, of, kusumapura, or, pataliputra, present, day, patna, bihar, bh, skara, i, describes, aryabhata, as, mak, ya, one, belonging, to, the, a, maka, country, during, the, buddha, s, time, a, branch, of, the, a, maka, people, settled, in, the, region, between, the, narmada, and, godavari, rivers, in, central, india, it, has, been, claimed, that, the, a, maka, sanskrit, for, stone, where, aryabhata, originated, may, be, the, present, day, kodungallur, which, was, the, historical, capital, city, of, thiruvanchikkulam, of, ancient, kerala, this, is, based, on, the, belief, that, ko, u, all, r, was, earlier, known, as, ko, um, kal, l, r, city, of, hard, stones, however, old, records, show, that, the, city, was, actually, ko, um, kol, r, city, of, strict, governance, similarly, the, fact, that, several, commentaries, on, the, aryabhatiya, have, come, from, kerala, has, been, used, to, suggest, that, it, was, aryabhata, s, main, place, of, life, and, activity, however, many, commentaries, have, come, from, outside, kerala, and, the, aryasiddhanta, was, completely, unknown, in, kerala, k, chandra, hari, has, argued, for, the, kerala, hypothesis, on, the, basis, of, astronomical, evidence, aryabhata, mentions, lanka, on, several, occasions, in, the, aryabhatiya, but, his, lanka, is, an, abstraction, standing, for, a, point, on, the, equator, at, the, same, longitude, as, his, ujjayini, it, is, fairly, certain, that, at, some, point, he, went, to, kusumapura, for, advanced, studies, and, lived, there, for, some, time, both, hindu, and, buddhist, tradition, as, well, as, bh, skara, i, ce, 629, identify, kusumapura, as, p, aliputra, modern, patna, a, verse, mentions, that, aryabhata, was, the, head, of, an, institution, kulapa, at, kusumapura, and, because, the, university, of, nalanda, was, in, pataliputra, at, the, time, it, is, speculated, that, aryabhata, might, have, been, the, head, of, the, nalanda, university, as, well, aryabhata, is, also, reputed, to, have, set, up, an, observatory, at, the, sun, temple, in, taregana, bihar, aryabhata, is, the, author, of, several, treatises, on, mathematics, and, astronomy, though, aryabhatiya, is, the, only, one, which, survives, much, of, the, research, included, subjects, in, astronomy, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, and, other, fields, aryabhata, s, major, work, were, based, on, previous, discoveries, by, greeks, mesapotamians, aryabhatiya, a, compendium, of, mathematics, and, astronomy, was, referred, to, in, the, indian, mathematical, literature, and, has, survived, to, modern, times, the, mathematical, part, of, the, aryabhatiya, covers, arithmetic, algebra, plane, trigonometry, and, spherical, trigonometry, it, also, contains, continued, fractions, quadratic, equations, sums, of, power, series, and, a, table, of, sines, the, arya, siddhanta, a, lost, work, on, astronomical, computations, is, known, through, the, writings, of, aryabhata, s, contemporary, varahamihira, and, later, mathematicians, and, commentators, including, brahmagupta, and, bhaskara, i, this, work, appears, to, be, based, on, the, older, surya, siddhanta, which, was, a, sanskrit, summary, of, greek, and, mesapotamian, theories, in, astronomy, and, mathematics, and, uses, the, midnight, day, reckoning, as, opposed, to, sunrise, in, aryabhatiya, it, also, contained, a, description, of, several, astronomical, instruments, the, gnomon, shanku, yantra, a, shadow, instrument, chhaya, yantra, possibly, angle, measuring, devices, semicircular, and, circular, dhanur, yantra, chakra, yantra, a, cylindrical, stick, yasti, yantra, an, umbrella, shaped, device, called, the, chhatra, yantra, and, water, clocks, of, at, least, two, types, bow, shaped, and, cylindrical, a, third, text, which, may, have, survived, in, the, arabic, translation, is, al, ntf, or, al, nanf, it, claims, that, it, is, a, translation, by, aryabhata, but, the, sanskrit, name, of, this, work, is, not, known, probably, dating, from, the, 9th, century, it, is, mentioned, by, the, persian, scholar, and, chronicler, of, india, ab, rayh, n, al, b, r, n, direct, details, of, aryabhata, s, work, are, known, only, from, the, aryabhatiya, the, name, aryabhatiya, is, due, to, later, commentators, aryabhata, himself, may, not, have, given, it, a, name, his, disciple, bhaskara, i, calls, it, ashmakatantra, or, the, treatise, from, the, ashmaka, it, is, also, occasionally, referred, to, as, arya, shatas, ashta, literally, aryabhata, s, 108, because, there, are, 108, verses, in, the, text, it, is, written, in, the, very, terse, style, typical, of, sutra, literature, in, which, each, line, is, an, aid, to, memory, for, a, complex, system, thus, the, explication, of, meaning, is, due, to, commentators, the, text, consists, of, the, 108, verses, and, 13, introductory, verses, and, is, divided, into, four, p, da, s, or, chapters, the, aryabhatiya, presented, a, number, of, innovations, in, mathematics, and, astronomy, in, verse, form, which, were, influential, for, many, centuries, the, extreme, brevity, of, the, text, was, elaborated, in, commentaries, by, his, disciple, bhaskara, i, bhashya, c, 600, ce, and, by, nilakantha, somayaji, in, his, aryabhatiya, bhasya, 1465, ce, aryabhatiya, is, also, well, known, for, his, description, of, relativity, of, motion, he, expressed, this, relativity, thus, just, as, a, man, in, a, boat, moving, forward, sees, the, stationary, objects, on, the, shore, as, moving, backward, just, so, are, the, stationary, stars, seen, by, the, people, on, earth, as, moving, exactly, towards, the, west, the, place, value, system, first, seen, in, the, 3rd, century, bakhshali, manuscript, was, clearly, in, place, in, his, work, while, he, did, not, use, a, symbol, for, zero, the, french, mathematician, georges, ifrah, argues, that, knowledge, of, zero, was, implicit, in, aryabhata, s, place, value, system, as, a, place, holder, for, the, powers, of, ten, with, null, coefficients, however, aryabhata, did, not, use, the, brahmi, numerals, continuing, the, sanskritic, tradition, from, vedic, times, he, used, letters, of, the, alphabet, to, denote, numbers, expressing, quantities, such, as, the, table, of, sines, in, a, mnemonic, form, aryabhata, worked, on, the, approximation, for, pi, and, may, have, come, to, the, conclusion, that, is, irrational, in, the, second, part, of, the, aryabhatiyam, ga, itap, da, 10, he, writes, caturadhika, atama, agu, a, dv, a, istath, sahasr, m, ayutadvayavi, kambhasy, sanno, v, ttapari, ha, add, four, to, 100, multiply, by, eight, and, then, add, 62, 000, by, this, rule, the, circumference, of, a, circle, with, a, diameter, of, 20, 000, can, be, approached, this, implies, that, for, a, circle, whose, diameter, is, 20000, the, circumference, will, be, 62832, i, e, displaystyle, pi, 62832, 20000, displaystyle, 62832, over, 20000, 3, 1416, displaystyle, 3, 1416, which, is, accurate, to, two, parts, in, one, million, it, is, speculated, that, aryabhata, used, the, word, sanna, approaching, to, mean, that, not, only, is, this, an, approximation, but, that, the, value, is, incommensurable, or, irrational, if, this, is, correct, it, is, quite, a, sophisticated, insight, because, the, irrationality, of, pi, was, proved, in, europe, only, in, 1761, by, lambert, after, aryabhatiya, was, translated, into, arabic, c, 820, ce, this, approximation, was, mentioned, in, al, khwarizmi, s, book, on, algebra, in, ganitapada, 6, aryabhata, gives, the, area, of, a, triangle, as, that, translates, to, for, a, triangle, the, result, of, a, perpendicular, with, the, half, side, is, the, area, aryabhata, discussed, the, concept, of, sine, in, his, work, by, the, name, of, ardha, jya, which, literally, means, half, chord, for, simplicity, people, started, calling, it, jya, when, arabic, writers, translated, his, works, from, sanskrit, into, arabic, they, referred, it, as, jiba, however, in, arabic, writings, vowels, are, omitted, and, it, was, abbreviated, as, jb, later, writers, substituted, it, with, jaib, meaning, pocket, or, fold, in, a, garment, in, arabic, jiba, is, a, meaningless, word, later, in, the, 12th, century, when, gherardo, of, cremona, translated, these, writings, from, arabic, into, latin, he, replaced, the, arabic, jaib, with, its, latin, counterpart, sinus, which, means, cove, or, bay, thence, comes, the, english, word, sine, a, problem, of, great, interest, to, indian, mathematicians, since, ancient, times, has, been, to, find, integer, solutions, to, diophantine, equations, that, have, the, form, ax, by, c, this, problem, was, also, studied, in, ancient, chinese, mathematics, and, its, solution, is, usually, referred, to, as, the, chinese, remainder, theorem, this, is, an, example, from, bh, skara, s, commentary, on, aryabhatiya, that, is, find, n, 8x, 5, 9y, 4, 7z, 1, it, turns, out, that, the, smallest, value, for, n, is, 85, in, general, diophantine, equations, such, as, this, can, be, notoriously, difficult, they, were, discussed, extensively, in, ancient, vedic, text, sulba, sutras, whose, more, ancient, parts, might, date, to, 800, bce, aryabhata, s, method, of, solving, such, problems, elaborated, by, bhaskara, in, 621, ce, is, called, the, ku, aka, method, ku, aka, means, pulverizing, or, breaking, into, small, pieces, and, the, method, involves, a, recursive, algorithm, for, writing, the, original, factors, in, smaller, numbers, this, algorithm, became, the, standard, method, for, solving, first, order, diophantine, equations, in, indian, mathematics, and, initially, the, whole, subject, of, algebra, was, called, ku, aka, ga, ita, or, simply, ku, aka, in, aryabhatiya, aryabhata, provided, elegant, results, for, the, summation, of, series, of, squares, and, cubes, and, aryabhata, s, system, of, astronomy, was, called, the, audayaka, system, in, which, days, are, reckoned, from, uday, dawn, at, lanka, or, equator, some, of, his, later, writings, on, astronomy, which, apparently, proposed, a, second, model, or, ardha, ratrika, midnight, are, lost, but, can, be, partly, reconstructed, from, the, discussion, in, brahmagupta, s, khandakhadyaka, in, some, texts, he, seems, to, ascribe, the, apparent, motions, of, the, heavens, to, the, earth, s, rotation, he, may, have, believed, that, the, planet, s, orbits, are, elliptical, rather, than, circular, aryabhata, correctly, insisted, that, the, earth, rotates, about, its, axis, daily, and, that, the, apparent, movement, of, the, stars, is, a, relative, motion, caused, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, contrary, to, the, then, prevailing, view, that, the, sky, rotated, this, is, indicated, in, the, first, chapter, of, the, aryabhatiya, where, he, gives, the, number, of, rotations, of, the, earth, in, a, yuga, and, made, more, explicit, in, his, gola, chapter, in, the, same, way, that, someone, in, a, boat, going, forward, sees, an, unmoving, going, backward, so, on, the, equator, sees, the, unmoving, stars, going, uniformly, westward, the, cause, of, rising, and, setting, the, sphere, of, the, stars, together, with, the, planets, turns, due, west, at, the, equator, constantly, pushed, by, the, cosmic, wind, aryabhata, described, a, geocentric, model, of, the, solar, system, in, which, the, sun, and, moon, are, each, carried, by, epicycles, they, in, turn, revolve, around, the, earth, in, this, model, which, is, also, found, in, the, pait, mahasiddh, nta, c, 425, ce, the, motions, of, the, planets, are, each, governed, by, two, epicycles, a, smaller, manda, slow, and, a, larger, ghra, fast, the, order, of, the, planets, in, terms, of, distance, from, earth, is, taken, as, the, moon, mercury, venus, the, sun, mars, jupiter, saturn, and, the, asterisms, the, positions, and, periods, of, the, planets, was, calculated, relative, to, uniformly, moving, points, in, the, case, of, mercury, and, venus, they, move, around, the, earth, at, the, same, mean, speed, as, the, sun, in, the, case, of, mars, jupiter, and, saturn, they, move, around, the, earth, at, specific, speeds, representing, each, planet, s, motion, through, the, zodiac, most, historians, of, astronomy, consider, that, this, two, epicycle, model, reflects, elements, of, pre, ptolemaic, greek, astronomy, another, element, in, aryabhata, s, model, the, ghrocca, the, basic, planetary, period, in, relation, to, the, sun, is, seen, by, some, historians, as, a, sign, of, an, underlying, heliocentric, model, solar, and, lunar, eclipses, were, scientifically, explained, by, aryabhata, he, states, that, the, moon, and, planets, shine, by, reflected, sunlight, instead, of, the, prevailing, cosmogony, in, which, eclipses, were, caused, by, rahu, and, ketu, identified, as, the, pseudo, planetary, lunar, nodes, he, explains, eclipses, in, terms, of, shadows, cast, by, and, falling, on, earth, thus, the, lunar, eclipse, occurs, when, the, moon, enters, into, the, earth, s, shadow, verse, gola, 37, he, discusses, at, length, the, size, and, extent, of, the, earth, s, shadow, verses, gola, 38, 48, and, then, provides, the, computation, and, the, size, of, the, eclipsed, part, during, an, eclipse, later, indian, astronomers, improved, on, the, calculations, but, aryabhata, s, methods, provided, the, core, his, computational, paradigm, was, so, accurate, that, 18th, century, scientist, guillaume, le, gentil, during, a, visit, to, pondicherry, india, found, the, indian, computations, of, the, duration, of, the, lunar, eclipse, of, 30, august, 1765, to, be, short, by, 41, seconds, whereas, his, charts, by, tobias, mayer, 1752, were, long, by, 68, seconds, considered, in, modern, english, units, of, time, aryabhata, calculated, the, sidereal, rotation, the, rotation, of, the, earth, referencing, the, fixed, stars, as, 23, hours, 56, minutes, and, 4, 1, seconds, the, modern, value, is, 23, 56, 4, 091, similarly, his, value, for, the, length, of, the, sidereal, year, at, 365, days, 6, hours, 12, minutes, and, 30, seconds, 365, 25858, days, is, an, error, of, 3, minutes, and, 20, seconds, over, the, length, of, a, year, 365, 25636, days, as, mentioned, aryabhata, advocated, an, astronomical, model, in, which, the, earth, turns, on, its, own, axis, his, model, also, gave, corrections, the, gra, anomaly, for, the, speeds, of, the, planets, in, the, sky, in, terms, of, the, mean, speed, of, the, sun, thus, it, has, been, suggested, that, aryabhata, s, calculations, were, based, on, an, underlying, heliocentric, model, in, which, the, planets, orbit, the, sun, though, this, has, been, rebutted, it, has, also, been, suggested, that, aspects, of, aryabhata, s, system, may, have, been, derived, from, an, earlier, likely, pre, ptolemaic, greek, heliocentric, model, of, which, indian, astronomers, were, unaware, though, the, evidence, is, scant, the, general, consensus, is, that, a, synodic, anomaly, depending, on, the, position, of, the, sun, does, not, imply, a, physically, heliocentric, orbit, such, corrections, being, also, present, in, late, babylonian, astronomical, texts, and, that, aryabhata, s, system, was, not, explicitly, heliocentric, aryabhata, s, work, was, of, great, influence, in, the, indian, astronomical, tradition, and, influenced, several, neighbouring, cultures, through, translations, the, arabic, translation, during, the, islamic, golden, age, c, 820, ce, was, particularly, influential, some, of, his, results, are, cited, by, al, khwarizmi, and, in, the, 10th, century, al, biruni, stated, that, aryabhata, s, followers, believed, that, the, earth, rotated, on, its, axis, his, definitions, of, sine, jya, cosine, kojya, versine, utkrama, jya, and, inverse, sine, otkram, jya, influenced, the, birth, of, trigonometry, he, was, also, the, first, to, specify, sine, and, versine, 1, cos, x, tables, in, 3, 75, intervals, from, 0, to, 90, to, an, accuracy, of, 4, decimal, places, in, fact, the, modern, terms, sine, and, cosine, are, mistranscriptions, of, the, words, jya, and, kojya, as, introduced, by, aryabhata, as, mentioned, they, were, translated, as, jiba, and, kojiba, in, arabic, and, then, misunderstood, by, gerard, of, cremona, while, translating, an, arabic, geometry, text, to, latin, he, assumed, that, jiba, was, the, arabic, word, jaib, which, means, fold, in, a, garment, l, sinus, c, 1150, aryabhata, s, astronomical, calculation, methods, were, also, very, influential, along, with, the, trigonometric, tables, they, came, to, be, widely, used, in, the, islamic, world, and, used, to, compute, many, arabic, astronomical, tables, zijes, in, particular, the, astronomical, tables, in, the, work, of, the, arabic, spain, scientist, al, zarqali, 11th, century, were, translated, into, latin, as, the, tables, of, toledo, 12th, century, and, remained, the, most, accurate, ephemeris, used, in, europe, for, centuries, calendric, calculations, devised, by, aryabhata, and, his, followers, have, been, in, continuous, use, in, india, for, the, practical, purposes, of, fixing, the, panchangam, the, hindu, calendar, in, the, islamic, world, they, formed, the, basis, of, the, jalali, calendar, introduced, in, 1073, ce, by, a, group, of, astronomers, including, omar, khayyam, versions, of, which, modified, in, 1925, are, the, national, calendars, in, use, in, iran, and, afghanistan, today, the, dates, of, the, jalali, calendar, are, based, on, actual, solar, transit, as, in, aryabhata, and, earlier, siddhanta, calendars, this, type, of, calendar, requires, an, ephemeris, for, calculating, dates, although, dates, were, difficult, to, compute, seasonal, errors, were, less, in, the, jalali, calendar, than, in, the, gregorian, calendar, aryabhatta, knowledge, university, aku, patna, has, been, established, by, government, of, bihar, for, the, development, and, management, of, educational, infrastructure, related, to, technical, medical, management, and, allied, professional, education, in, his, honour, the, university, is, governed, by, bihar, state, university, act, 2008, india, s, first, satellite, aryabhata, and, the, lunar, crater, aryabhata, are, both, named, in, his, honour, the, aryabhata, satellite, also, featured, on, the, reverse, of, the, indian, 2, rupee, note, an, institute, for, conducting, research, in, astronomy, astrophysics, and, atmospheric, sciences, is, the, aryabhatta, research, institute, of, observational, sciences, aries, near, nainital, india, the, inter, school, aryabhata, maths, competition, is, also, named, after, him, as, is, bacillus, aryabhata, a, species, of, bacteria, discovered, in, the, stratosphere, by, isro, scientists, in, 2009, he, believes, that, the, moon, and, planets, shine, by, reflected, sunlight, incredibly, he, believes, that, the, orbits, of, the, planets, are, ellipses
