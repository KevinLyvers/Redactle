hall, jr, thought, this, was, unfair, and, said, phelps, did, not, deserve, a, spot, on, the, relay, phelps, argued, his, program, was, too, crowded, to, compete, in, 100, meter, freestyle, and, was, at, least, among, the, top, four, swimmers, because, he, had, beaten, the, top, seeded, jason, lezak, the, last, time, he, had, swum, against, him, in, his, first, event, the, 400, meter, individual, medley, phelps, won, his, first, olympic, gold, medal, in, the, world, record, time, of, 4, 08, 26, the, following, day, phelps, along, with, ian, crocker, neil, walker, and, jason, lezak, finished, in, third, place, in, the, 4, 100, meter, freestyle, relay, with, a, time, of, 3, 14, 62, crocker, s, lead, off, time, of, 50, 05, was, the, worst, among, the, field, and, was, blamed, on, sickness, in, the, event, many, were, calling, the, race, of, the, century, the, 200, meter, freestyle, that, was, held, the, following, day, phelps, finished, in, third, place, behind, ian, thorpe, and, pieter, van, den, hoogenband, although, this, race, ended, the, chance, to, match, spitz, s, record, phelps, had, savored, the, challenge, even, though, it, was, not, his, strongest, event, saying, how, can, i, be, disappointed, i, swam, in, a, field, with, the, two, fastest, freestylers, of, all, time, in, his, fourth, event, the, 200, meter, butterfly, held, the, following, day, phelps, won,

time, by, just, 0, 04, seconds, with, a, time, of, 51, 25, traditionally, the, american, who, places, highest, in, an, individual, event, will, be, automatically, given, the, corresponding, leg, in, the, 4, 100, meter, medley, relay, final, this, gave, phelps, an, automatic, entry, into, the, medley, relay, but, he, deferred, and, crocker, swam, instead, phelps, s, gesture, gave, crocker, a, chance, to, make, amends, for, a, mistake, at, the, start, of, the, freestyle, relay, as, well, getting, his, final, shot, at, a, gold, medal, the, american, medley, team, went, on, to, win, the, event, in, world, record, time, and, since, phelps, had, raced, in, a, preliminary, heat, of, the, medley, relay, he, was, also, awarded, a, gold, medal, along, with, the, team, members, who,
