abd, al, rahman, was, born, in, palmyra, near, damascus, in, the, heartland, of, the, umayyad, caliphate, the, son, of, the, umayyad, prince, mu, awiya, ibn, hisham, and, his, concubine, raha, a, berber, woman, from, the, nafza, tribe, and, thus, the, grandson, of, hisham, ibn, abd, al, malik, caliph, from, 724, to, 743, he, was, twenty, when, his, family, the, ruling, umayyads, were, overthrown, by, the, abbasid, revolution, in, 748, 750, abd, al, rahman, and, a, small, part, of, his, family, fled, damascus, where, the, center, of, umayyad, power, had, been, people, moving, with, him, included, his, brother, yahya, his, four, year, old, son, sulayman, and, some, of, his, sisters, as, well, as, his, greek, mawla, freedman, or, client, bedr, the, family, fled, from, damascus, to, the, river, euphrates, all, along, the, way, the, path, was, filled, with, danger, as, the, abbasids, had, dispatched, horsemen, across, the, region, to, try, to, find, the, umayyad, prince, and, kill, him, the, abbasids, were, merciless, with, all, umayyads, that, they, found, abbasid, agents, closed, in, on, abd, al, rahman, and, his, family, while, they, were, hiding, in, a, small, village, he, left, his, young, son, with, his, sisters, and, fled, with, yahya, accounts, vary, but, bedr, likely, escaped, with, abd, al, rahman, some, histories, indicate, that, bedr, met, up, with, abd, al, rahman, at, a, later, date, abd, al, rahman, yahya, and, bedr, quit, the, village, narrowly, escaping, the, abbasid, assassins, on, the, way, south, abbasid, horsemen, again, caught, up, with, the, trio, abd, al, rahman, and, his, companions, then, threw, themselves, into, the, river, euphrates, the, horsemen, urged, them, to, return, promising, that, no, harm, would, come, to, them, and, yahya, perhaps, from, fear, of, drowning, turned, back, the, 17th, century, historian, ahmed, mohammed, al, maqqari, poignantly, described, abd, al, rahman, s, reaction, as, he, implored, yahya, to, keep, going, o, brother, come, to, me, come, to, me, yahya, returned, to, the, near, shore, and, was, quickly, dispatched, by, the, horsemen, they, cut, off, his, head, and, left, his, body, to, rot, al, maqqari, quotes, earlier, historians, reporting, that, abd, al, rahman, was, so, overcome, with, fear, that, from, the, far, shore, he, ran, until, exhaustion, overcame, him, only, he, and, bedr, were, left, to, face, the, unknown, after, barely, escaping, with, their, lives, abd, al, rahman, and, bedr, continued, south, through, palestine, the, sinai, and, then, into, egypt, abd, al, rahman, had, to, keep, a, low, profile, as, he, traveled, it, may, be, assumed, that, he, intended, to, go, at, least, as, far, as, northwestern, africa, maghreb, the, land, of, his, mother, which, had, been, partly, conquered, by, his, umayyad, predecessors, the, journey, across, egypt, would, prove, perilous, at, the, time, abd, al, rahman, ibn, habib, al, fihri, was, the, semi, autonomous, governor, of, ifriqiya, roughly, modern, tunisia, and, a, former, umayyad, vassal, the, ambitious, ibn, habib, a, member, of, the, illustrious, fihrid, family, had, long, sought, to, carve, out, ifriqiya, as, a, private, dominion, for, himself, at, first, he, sought, an, understanding, with, the, abbasids, but, when, they, refused, his, terms, and, demanded, his, submission, ibn, habib, broke, openly, with, the, abbasids, and, invited, the, remnants, of, the, umayyad, dynasty, to, take, refuge, in, his, dominions, abd, al, rahman, was, only, one, of, several, surviving, umayyad, family, members, to, make, their, way, to, ifriqiya, at, this, time, but, ibn, habib, soon, changed, his, mind, he, feared, the, presence, of, prominent, umayyad, exiles, in, ifriqiya, a, family, more, illustrious, than, his, own, might, become, a, focal, point, for, intrigue, among, local, nobles, against, his, own, usurped, powers, around, 755, believing, he, had, discovered, plots, involving, some, of, the, more, prominent, umayyad, exiles, in, kairouan, ibn, habib, turned, against, them, at, the, time, abd, al, rahman, and, bedr, were, keeping, a, low, profile, staying, in, kabylie, at, the, camp, of, a, nafza, berber, chieftain, friendly, to, their, plight, ibn, habib, dispatched, spies, to, look, for, the, umayyad, prince, when, ibn, habib, s, soldiers, entered, the, camp, the, berber, chieftain, s, wife, tekfah, hid, abd, al, rahman, under, her, personal, belongings, to, help, him, go, unnoticed, once, they, were, gone, abd, al, rahman, and, bedr, immediately, set, off, westwards, in, 755, abd, al, rahman, and, bedr, reached, modern, day, morocco, near, ceuta, their, next, step, would, be, to, cross, the, sea, to, al, andalus, where, abd, al, rahman, could, not, have, been, sure, whether, or, not, he, would, be, welcomed, following, the, berber, revolt, of, the, 740s, the, province, was, in, a, crisis, with, the, muslim, community, torn, by, tribal, dissensions, among, the, arabs, the, qays, yemeni, feud, and, racial, tensions, between, the, arabs, and, berbers, at, that, moment, the, nominal, ruler, of, al, andalus, emir, yusuf, ibn, abd, al, rahman, al, fihri, another, member, of, the, fihrid, family, and, a, favorite, of, the, old, arab, settlers, baladiyun, mostly, of, south, arabian, or, yemeni, tribal, stock, was, locked, in, a, contest, with, his, vizier, and, son, in, law, al, sumayl, ibn, hatim, al, kilabi, the, head, of, the, syrians, the, shamiyun, drawn, from, the, junds, or, military, regiments, of, syria, mostly, of, north, arabian, qaysid, tribes, who, had, arrived, in, 742, among, the, syrian, junds, were, contingents, of, old, umayyad, clients, numbering, perhaps, 500, and, abd, al, rahman, believed, he, might, tug, on, old, loyalties, and, get, them, to, receive, him, bedr, was, dispatched, across, the, straits, to, make, contact, bedr, managed, to, line, up, three, syrian, commanders, ubayd, allah, ibn, uthman, and, abd, allah, ibn, khalid, both, originally, of, damascus, and, yusuf, ibn, bukht, of, qinnasrin, the, trio, approached, the, syrian, arch, commander, al, sumayl, then, in, zaragoza, to, get, his, consent, but, al, sumayl, refused, fearing, abd, al, rahman, would, try, to, make, himself, emir, as, a, result, bedr, and, the, umayyad, clients, sent, out, feelers, to, their, rivals, the, yemeni, commanders, although, the, yemenis, were, not, natural, allies, the, umayyads, are, cousins, of, the, qaysid, tribes, their, interest, was, piqued, the, emir, yusuf, al, fihri, had, proven, himself, unable, to, keep, the, powerful, al, sumayl, in, check, and, several, yemeni, chieftains, felt, their, future, prospects, were, poor, whether, in, a, fihrid, or, syrian, dominated, spain, so, that, they, had, a, better, chance, of, advancement, if, they, hitched, themselves, to, the, glitter, of, the, umayyad, name, although, the, umayyads, did, not, have, a, historical, presence, in, the, region, no, member, of, the, umayyad, family, was, known, to, have, ever, set, foot, in, al, andalus, before, and, there, were, grave, concerns, about, young, abd, al, rahman, s, inexperience, several, of, the, lower, ranking, yemeni, commanders, felt, they, had, little, to, lose, and, much, to, gain, and, agreed, to, support, the, prince, bedr, returned, to, africa, to, tell, abd, al, rahman, of, the, invitation, of, the, umayyad, clients, in, al, andalus, shortly, thereafter, they, set, off, with, a, small, group, of, followers, for, europe, when, some, local, berber, tribesmen, learned, of, abd, al, rahman, s, intent, to, set, sail, for, al, andalus, they, quickly, rode, to, catch, up, with, him, on, the, coast, the, tribesmen, might, have, figured, that, they, could, hold, abd, al, rahman, as, hostage, and, force, him, to, buy, his, way, out, of, africa, he, did, indeed, hand, over, some, amount, of, dinars, to, the, suddenly, hostile, local, berbers, just, as, abd, al, rahman, launched, his, boat, another, group, of, berbers, arrived, they, also, tried, to, obtain, a, fee, from, him, for, leaving, one, of, the, berbers, held, on, to, abd, al, rahman, s, vessel, as, it, made, for, al, andalus, and, allegedly, had, his, hand, cut, off, by, one, of, the, boat, s, crew, abd, al, rahman, landed, at, almu, car, in, al, andalus, to, the, east, of, m, laga, in, september, 755, however, his, landing, site, was, unconfirmed, upon, landing, in, torrox, al, andalus, abd, al, rahman, was, greeted, by, clients, abu, uthman, and, ibn, khalid, and, an, escort, of, 300, cavalry, during, his, brief, time, in, m, laga, he, was, able, to, amass, local, support, quickly, waves, of, people, made, their, way, to, m, laga, to, pay, respect, to, the, prince, they, thought, was, dead, including, many, of, the, aforementioned, syrians, one, famous, story, that, persisted, through, history, related, to, a, gift, abd, al, rahman, was, given, while, in, m, laga, the, gift, was, a, beautiful, young, slave, girl, but, abd, al, rahman, humbly, returned, her, to, her, previous, master, news, of, the, prince, s, arrival, spread, like, wildfire, throughout, the, peninsula, during, this, time, emir, al, fihri, and, the, syrian, commander, al, sumayl, pondered, what, to, do, about, the, new, threat, to, their, shaky, hold, on, power, they, decided, to, try, to, marry, abd, al, rahman, into, their, family, if, that, did, not, work, then, abd, al, rahman, would, have, to, be, killed, abd, al, rahman, was, apparently, sagacious, enough, to, expect, such, a, plot, in, order, to, help, speed, his, ascension, to, power, he, was, prepared, to, take, advantage, of, the, feuds, and, dissensions, however, before, anything, could, be, done, trouble, broke, out, in, northern, al, andalus, zaragoza, an, important, trade, city, on, the, upper, march, of, al, andalus, made, a, bid, for, autonomy, al, fihri, and, al, sumayl, rode, north, to, quash, the, rebellion, this, might, have, been, fortunate, timing, for, abd, al, rahman, since, he, was, still, getting, a, solid, foothold, in, al, andalus, by, march, 756, abd, al, rahman, and, his, growing, following, of, umayyad, clients, and, yemeni, junds, were, able, to, take, sevilla, without, violence, he, managed, to, break, the, rebellion, attempt, in, zaragoza, but, just, about, that, time, the, cordovan, governor, received, news, of, a, basque, rebellion, in, pamplona, an, important, detachment, was, sent, by, yusuf, ibn, abd, al, rahman, to, quash, it, but, his, troops, were, annihilated, after, the, setback, al, fihri, turned, his, army, back, south, to, face, the, pretender, the, fight, for, the, right, to, rule, al, andalus, was, about, to, begin, the, two, contingents, met, on, opposite, sides, of, the, river, guadalquivir, just, outside, the, capital, of, c, rdoba, on, the, plains, of, musarah, the, river, was, for, the, first, time, in, years, overflowing, its, banks, heralding, the, end, of, a, long, drought, nevertheless, food, was, still, scarce, and, abd, al, rahman, s, army, suffered, from, hunger, in, an, attempt, to, demoralize, abd, al, rahman, s, troops, al, fihri, ensured, that, his, troops, not, only, were, well, fed, but, also, ate, gluttonous, amounts, of, food, in, full, view, of, the, umayyad, lines, an, attempt, at, negotiations, soon, followed, in, which, it, is, likely, that, abd, al, rahman, was, offered, the, hand, of, al, fihri, s, daughter, in, marriage, and, great, wealth, abd, al, rahman, however, would, settle, for, nothing, less, than, control, of, the, emirate, and, an, impasse, was, reached, even, before, the, fight, began, dissension, spread, through, some, of, abd, al, rahman, s, lines, specifically, the, yemeni, arabs, were, unhappy, that, the, prince, was, mounted, on, a, fine, spanish, steed, and, that, his, mettle, was, untried, in, battle, the, yemenis, observed, significantly, that, such, a, fine, horse, would, provide, an, excellent, mount, to, escape, from, battle, being, the, ever, wary, politician, abd, al, rahman, acted, quickly, to, regain, yemeni, support, and, rode, to, a, yemeni, chief, who, was, mounted, on, a, mule, named, lightning, abd, al, rahman, averred, that, his, horse, proved, difficult, to, ride, and, was, wont, to, buck, him, out, of, the, saddle, he, offered, to, exchange, his, horse, for, the, mule, a, deal, to, which, the, surprised, chief, readily, agreed, the, swap, quelled, the, simmering, yemeni, rebellion, soon, both, armies, were, in, their, lines, on, the, same, bank, of, the, guadalquivir, abd, al, rahman, had, no, banner, and, so, one, was, improvised, by, unwinding, a, green, turban, and, binding, it, round, the, head, of, a, spear, subsequently, the, turban, and, the, spear, became, the, banner, and, symbol, of, the, andalusian, umayyads, abd, al, rahman, led, the, charge, toward, al, fihri, s, army, al, sumayl, in, turn, advanced, his, cavalry, out, to, meet, the, umayyad, threat, after, a, long, and, difficult, fight, abd, ar, rahman, obtained, a, most, complete, victory, and, the, field, was, strewn, with, the, bodies, of, the, enemy, both, al, fihri, and, al, sumayl, managed, to, escape, the, field, probably, with, parts, of, the, army, too, abd, al, rahman, triumphantly, marched, into, the, capital, c, rdoba, danger, was, not, far, behind, as, al, fihri, planned, a, counter, attack, he, reorganized, his, forces, and, set, out, for, the, capital, abd, al, rahman, had, usurped, from, him, again, abd, al, rahman, met, al, fihri, with, his, army, this, time, negotiations, were, successful, although, the, terms, were, somewhat, changed, in, exchange, for, al, fihri, s, life, and, wealth, he, would, be, a, prisoner, and, not, allowed, to, leave, the, city, limits, of, c, rdoba, al, fihri, would, have, to, report, once, a, day, to, abd, al, rahman, as, well, as, turn, over, some, of, his, sons, and, daughters, as, hostages, for, a, while, al, fihri, met, the, obligations, of, the, one, sided, truce, but, he, still, had, many, people, loyal, to, him, people, who, would, have, liked, to, see, him, back, in, power, al, fihri, eventually, did, make, another, bid, for, power, he, quit, c, rdoba, and, quickly, started, gathering, supporters, while, at, large, al, fihri, managed, to, gather, an, army, allegedly, numbering, 20, 000, it, is, doubtful, however, that, his, troops, were, regular, soldiers, but, rather, a, hodge, podge, of, men, from, various, parts, of, al, andalus, abd, al, rahman, s, appointed, governor, in, sevilla, took, up, the, chase, and, after, a, series, of, small, fights, managed, to, defeat, al, fihri, s, army, al, fihri, himself, managed, to, escape, to, the, former, visigoth, capital, of, toledo, in, central, al, andalus, once, there, he, was, promptly, killed, al, fihri, s, head, was, sent, to, c, rdoba, where, abd, al, rahman, had, it, nailed, to, a, bridge, with, this, act, abd, al, rahman, proclaimed, himself, the, emir, of, al, andalus, however, in, order, to, take, over, southern, iberia, al, fihri, s, general, al, sumayl, had, to, be, dealt, with, and, he, was, garroted, in, c, rdoba, s, jail, still, most, of, central, and, northern, al, andalus, toledo, zaragoza, barcelona, etc, was, out, of, his, rule, with, large, swathes, remaining, in, the, hands, of, yusuf, ibn, abd, al, rahman, al, fihri, s, supporters, until, 779, submission, of, zaragoza, it, is, unclear, whether, abd, al, rahman, proclaimed, himself, caliph, there, are, documents, in, the, archives, of, cordoba, that, state, that, this, was, his, first, act, upon, entering, the, city, however, historically, he, is, recorded, as, emir, and, not, caliph, abd, al, rahman, s, 7th, descendant, abd, al, rahman, iii, would, however, take, up, the, title, of, caliph, in, the, meantime, a, call, went, out, through, the, muslim, world, that, al, andalus, was, a, safe, haven, for, friends, of, the, house, of, umayya, if, not, for, abd, al, rahman, s, scattered, family, that, managed, to, evade, the, abbasids, abd, al, rahman, probably, was, quite, happy, to, see, his, call, answered, by, waves, of, umayyad, faithful, and, family, he, was, finally, reacquainted, with, his, son, sulayman, whom, he, last, saw, weeping, on, the, banks, of, the, euphrates, with, his, sisters, abd, al, rahman, s, sisters, were, unable, to, make, the, long, voyage, to, al, andalus, abd, al, rahman, placed, his, family, members, in, high, offices, across, the, land, as, he, felt, he, could, trust, them, more, than, non, family, the, umayyad, family, would, again, grow, large, and, prosperous, over, successive, generations, one, of, these, kinsmen, abd, al, malik, ibn, umar, ibn, marwan, persuaded, abd, al, rahman, in, 757, to, drop, the, name, of, the, abbasid, caliph, from, the, friday, prayers, a, traditional, recognition, of, sovereignty, in, medieval, islam, and, became, one, of, his, top, generals, and, his, governor, in, seville, by, 763, abd, al, rahman, had, to, get, back, to, the, business, of, war, al, andalus, had, been, invaded, by, an, abbasid, army, far, away, in, baghdad, the, current, abbasid, caliph, al, mansur, had, long, been, planning, to, depose, the, umayyad, who, dared, to, call, himself, emir, of, al, andalus, al, mansur, installed, al, ala, ibn, mugith, as, governor, of, africa, whose, title, gave, him, dominion, over, the, province, of, al, andalus, it, was, al, ala, who, headed, the, abbasid, army, that, landed, in, al, andalus, possibly, near, beja, in, modern, day, portugal, much, of, the, surrounding, area, of, beja, capitulated, to, al, ala, and, in, fact, rallied, under, the, abbasid, banners, against, abd, al, rahman, abd, al, rahman, had, to, act, quickly, the, abbasid, contingent, was, vastly, superior, in, size, said, to, have, numbered, 7, 000, men, the, emir, quickly, made, for, the, redoubt, of, carmona, with, his, army, the, abbasid, army, was, fast, on, their, heels, and, laid, siege, to, carmona, for, approximately, two, months, abd, al, rahman, must, have, sensed, that, time, was, against, him, as, food, and, water, became, scarce, and, his, troops, morale, likely, came, into, question, finally, abd, al, rahman, gathered, his, men, as, he, was, resolved, on, an, audacious, sally, abd, al, rahman, hand, picked, 700, fighters, from, his, army, and, led, them, to, carmona, s, main, gate, there, he, started, a, great, fire, and, threw, his, scabbard, into, the, flames, abd, al, rahman, told, his, men, that, time, had, come, to, go, down, fighting, rather, than, die, of, hunger, the, gate, lifted, and, abd, al, rahman, s, men, fell, upon, the, unsuspecting, abbasids, thoroughly, routing, them, most, of, the, abbasid, army, was, killed, the, heads, of, the, main, abbasid, leaders, were, cut, off, preserved, in, salt, identifying, tags, pinned, to, their, ears, and, then, bundled, together, in, a, gruesome, package, and, sent, to, the, abbasid, caliph, who, was, on, pilgrimage, at, mecca, upon, receiving, the, evidence, of, al, ala, s, defeat, in, al, andalus, al, mansur, is, said, to, have, gasped, god, be, praised, for, placing, a, sea, between, us, al, mansur, hated, and, yet, apparently, respected, abd, al, rahman, to, such, a, degree, that, he, dubbed, him, the, hawk, of, quraysh, the, umayyads, were, from, a, branch, of, the, quraysh, tribe, despite, such, a, tremendous, victory, abd, al, rahman, had, to, continuously, put, down, rebellions, in, al, andalus, various, arab, and, berber, tribes, fought, each, other, for, varying, degrees, of, power, some, cities, tried, to, break, away, and, form, their, own, state, and, even, members, of, abd, al, rahman, s, family, tried, to, wrest, power, from, him, during, a, large, revolt, dissidents, marched, on, c, rdoba, itself, however, abd, al, rahman, always, managed, to, stay, one, step, ahead, and, crushed, all, opposition, as, he, always, dealt, severely, with, dissidents, in, al, andalus, zaragoza, proved, to, be, a, most, difficult, city, to, reign, over, for, not, only, abd, al, rahman, but, his, successors, as, well, in, the, year, 777, 778, several, notable, men, including, sulayman, ibn, yokdan, al, arabi, al, kelbi, the, self, appointed, governor, of, zaragoza, met, with, delegates, of, the, leader, of, the, franks, charlemagne, army, was, enlisted, to, help, the, muslim, governors, of, barcelona, and, zaragoza, against, the, umayyad, in, cordoba, essentially, charlemagne, was, being, hired, as, a, mercenary, even, though, he, likely, had, other, plans, of, acquiring, the, area, for, his, own, empire, after, charlemagne, s, columns, arrived, at, the, gates, of, zaragoza, sulayman, got, cold, feet, and, refused, to, let, the, franks, into, the, city, after, his, subordinate, al, husayn, ibn, yahiya, had, successfully, defeated, and, captured, abd, al, rahman, s, most, trusted, general, thalaba, ibn, ubayd, it, is, possible, that, he, realized, that, charlemagne, would, want, to, usurp, power, from, him, after, capturing, sulayman, charlemagne, s, force, eventually, headed, back, to, france, via, a, narrow, pass, in, the, pyrenees, where, his, rearguard, was, wiped, out, by, basque, and, gascon, rebels, this, disaster, inspired, the, epic, chanson, de, roland, charlemagne, was, also, attacked, by, sulayman, s, relatives, who, had, freed, sulayman, now, abd, al, rahman, could, deal, with, sulayman, and, the, city, of, zaragoza, without, having, to, fight, a, massive, christian, army, in, 779, abd, al, rahman, offered, husayn, one, of, sulayman, s, allies, the, job, of, zaragoza, s, governorship, the, temptation, was, too, much, for, al, husayn, who, murdered, his, colleague, sulayman, as, promised, al, husayn, was, awarded, zaragoza, with, the, expectation, that, he, would, always, be, a, subordinate, of, c, rdoba, however, within, two, years, al, husayn, broke, off, relations, with, abd, al, rahman, and, announced, that, zaragoza, would, be, an, independent, city, state, once, again, abd, al, rahman, had, to, be, concerned, with, developments, in, the, upper, march, he, was, intent, on, keeping, this, important, northern, border, city, within, the, umayyad, fold, by, 783, abd, al, rahman, s, army, advanced, on, zaragoza, it, appeared, as, though, abd, al, rahman, wanted, to, make, clear, to, this, troublesome, city, that, independence, was, out, of, the, question, included, in, the, arsenal, of, abd, al, rahman, s, army, were, thirty, six, siege, engines, zaragoza, s, famous, white, granite, defensive, walls, were, breached, under, a, torrent, of, ordnance, from, the, umayyad, lines, abd, al, rahman, s, warriors, spilled, into, the, city, s, streets, quickly,

population, must, have, become, muslim, however, other, scholars, have, argued, that, though, 80, of, al, andalus, converted, to, islam, it, did, not, truly, occur, until, near, the, 10th, century, christians, more, often, converted, to, islam, than, jews, although, there, were, converted, jews, among, the, new, followers, of, islam, there, was, a, great, deal, of, freedom, of, interaction, among, the, groups, for, example, sarah, the, granddaughter, of, the, visigoth, king, wittiza, married, a, muslim, man, and, bore, two, sons, who, were, later, counted, among, the, ranks, of, the,
