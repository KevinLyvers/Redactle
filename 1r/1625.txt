french, physicist, and, chemist, who, conducted, pioneering, research, on, radioactivity, she, was, the, first, woman, to, win, a, nobel, prize, the, first, person, to, win, a, nobel, prize, twice, and, the, only, person, to, win, a, nobel, prize, in, two, scientific, fields, her, husband, pierre, curie, was, a, co, winner, of, her, first, nobel, prize, making, them, the, first, married, couple, to, win, the, nobel, prize, and, launching, the, curie, family, legacy, of, five, nobel, prizes, she, was, in, 1906, the, first, woman, to, become, a, professor, at, the, university, of, paris, she, was, born, in, warsaw, in, what, was, then, the, kingdom, of, poland, part, of, the, russian, empire, she, studied, at, warsaw, s, clandestine, flying, university, and, began, her, practical, scientific, training, in, warsaw, in, 1891, aged, 24, she, followed, her, elder, sister, bronis, awa, to, study, in, paris, where, she, earned, her, higher, degrees, and, conducted, her, subsequent, scientific, work, in, 1895, she, married, the, french, physicist, pierre, curie, and, she, shared, the, 1903, nobel, prize, in, physics, with, him, and, with, the, physicist, henri, becquerel, for, their, pioneering, work, developing, the, theory, of, radioactivity, a, term, she, coined, in, 1906, pierre, curie, died, in, a, paris, street, accident, marie, won, the, 1911, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, for, her, discovery, of, the, elements, polonium, and, radium, using, techniques, she, invented, for, isolating, radioactive, isotopes, under, her, direction, the, world, s, first, studies, were, conducted, into, the, treatment, of, neoplasms, by, the, use, of, radioactive, isotopes, she, founded, the, curie, institute, in, paris, in, 1920, and, the, curie, institute, in, warsaw, in, 1932, both, remain, major, medical, research, centres, during, world, war, i, she, developed, mobile, radiography, units, to, provide, x, ray, services, to, field, hospitals, while, a, french, citizen, marie, sk, odowska, curie, who, used, both, surnames, never, lost, her, sense, of, polish, identity, she, taught, her, daughters, the, polish, language, and, took, them, on, visits, to, poland, she, named, the, first, chemical, element, she, discovered, polonium, after, her, native, country, marie, curie, died, in, 1934, aged, 66, at, the, sancellemoz, sanatorium, in, passy, haute, savoie, france, of, aplastic, anemia, likely, from, exposure, to, radiation, in, the, course, of, her, scientific, research, and, in, the, course, of, her, radiological, work, at, field, hospitals, during, world, war, i, in, addition, to, her, nobel, prizes, she, received, numerous, other, honours, and, tributes, in, 1995, she, became, the, first, woman, to, be, entombed, on, her, own, merits, in, the, paris, panth, on, and, poland, declared, 2011, the, year, of, marie, curie, during, the, international, year, of, chemistry, she, is, the, subject, of, numerous, biographical, works, maria, sk, odowska, was, born, in, warsaw, in, congress, poland, in, the, russian, empire, on, 7, november, 1867, the, fifth, and, youngest, child, of, well, known, teachers, bronis, awa, n, e, boguska, and, w, adys, aw, sk, odowski, the, elder, siblings, of, maria, nicknamed, mania, were, zofia, born, 1862, nicknamed, zosia, j, zef, born, 1863, nicknamed, j, zio, bronis, awa, born, 1865, nicknamed, bronia, and, helena, born, 1866, nicknamed, hela, on, both, the, paternal, and, maternal, sides, the, family, had, lost, their, property, and, fortunes, through, patriotic, involvements, in, polish, national, uprisings, aimed, at, restoring, poland, s, independence, the, most, recent, had, been, the, january, uprising, of, 1863, 65, this, condemned, the, subsequent, generation, including, maria, and, her, elder, siblings, to, a, difficult, struggle, to, get, ahead, in, life, maria, s, paternal, grandfather, j, zef, sk, odowski, had, been, principal, of, the, lublin, primary, school, attended, by, boles, aw, prus, who, became, a, leading, figure, in, polish, literature, w, adys, aw, sk, odowski, taught, mathematics, and, physics, subjects, that, maria, was, to, pursue, and, was, also, director, of, two, warsaw, gymnasia, secondary, schools, for, boys, after, russian, authorities, eliminated, laboratory, instruction, from, the, polish, schools, he, brought, much, of, the, laboratory, equipment, home, and, instructed, his, children, in, its, use, he, was, eventually, fired, by, his, russian, supervisors, for, pro, polish, sentiments, and, forced, to, take, lower, paying, posts, the, family, also, lost, money, on, a, bad, investment, and, eventually, chose, to, supplement, their, income, by, lodging, boys, in, the, house, maria, s, mother, bronis, awa, operated, a, prestigious, warsaw, boarding, school, for, girls, she, resigned, from, the, position, after, maria, was, born, she, died, of, tuberculosis, in, may, 1878, when, maria, was, ten, years, old, less, than, three, years, earlier, maria, s, oldest, sibling, zofia, had, died, of, typhus, contracted, from, a, boarder, maria, s, father, was, an, atheist, her, mother, a, devout, catholic, the, deaths, of, maria, s, mother, and, sister, caused, her, to, give, up, catholicism, and, become, agnostic, when, she, was, ten, years, old, maria, began, attending, the, boarding, school, of, j, sikorska, next, she, attended, a, gymnasium, for, girls, from, which, she, graduated, on, 12, june, 1883, with, a, gold, medal, after, a, collapse, possibly, due, to, depression, she, spent, the, following, year, in, the, countryside, with, relatives, of, her, father, and, the, next, year, with, her, father, in, warsaw, where, she, did, some, tutoring, unable, to, enrol, in, a, regular, institution, of, higher, education, because, she, was, a, woman, she, and, her, sister, bronis, awa, became, involved, with, the, clandestine, flying, university, sometimes, translated, as, floating, university, a, polish, patriotic, institution, of, higher, learning, that, admitted, women, students, maria, made, an, agreement, with, her, sister, bronis, awa, that, she, would, give, her, financial, assistance, during, bronis, awa, s, medical, studies, in, paris, in, exchange, for, similar, assistance, two, years, later, in, connection, with, this, maria, took, a, position, first, as, a, home, tutor, in, warsaw, then, for, two, years, as, a, governess, in, szczuki, with, a, landed, family, the, orawskis, who, were, relatives, of, her, father, while, working, for, the, latter, family, she, fell, in, love, with, their, son, kazimierz, orawski, a, future, eminent, mathematician, his, parents, rejected, the, idea, of, his, marrying, the, penniless, relative, and, kazimierz, was, unable, to, oppose, them, maria, s, loss, of, the, relationship, with, orawski, was, tragic, for, both, he, soon, earned, a, doctorate, and, pursued, an, academic, career, as, a, mathematician, becoming, a, professor, and, rector, of, krak, w, university, still, as, an, old, man, and, a, mathematics, professor, at, the, warsaw, polytechnic, he, would, sit, contemplatively, before, the, statue, of, maria, sk, odowska, that, had, been, erected, in, 1935, before, the, radium, institute, which, she, had, founded, in, 1932, at, the, beginning, of, 1890, bronis, awa, who, a, few, months, earlier, had, married, kazimierz, d, uski, a, polish, physician, and, social, and, political, activist, invited, maria, to, join, them, in, paris, maria, declined, because, she, could, not, afford, the, university, tuition, it, would, take, her, a, year, and, a, half, longer, to, gather, the, necessary, funds, she, was, helped, by, her, father, who, was, able, to, secure, a, more, lucrative, position, again, all, that, time, she, continued, to, educate, herself, reading, books, exchanging, letters, and, being, tutored, herself, in, early, 1889, she, returned, home, to, her, father, in, warsaw, she, continued, working, as, a, governess, and, remained, there, until, late, 1891, she, tutored, studied, at, the, flying, university, and, began, her, practical, scientific, training, 1890, 91, in, a, chemistry, laboratory, at, the, museum, of, industry, and, agriculture, at, krakowskie, przedmie, cie, 66, near, warsaw, s, old, town, the, laboratory, was, run, by, her, cousin, j, zef, boguski, who, had, been, an, assistant, in, saint, petersburg, to, the, russian, chemist, dmitri, mendeleyev, in, late, 1891, she, left, poland, for, france, in, paris, maria, or, marie, as, she, would, be, known, in, france, briefly, found, shelter, with, her, sister, and, brother, in, law, before, renting, a, garret, closer, to, the, university, in, the, latin, quarter, and, proceeding, with, her, studies, of, physics, chemistry, and, mathematics, at, the, university, of, paris, where, she, enrolled, in, late, 1891, she, subsisted, on, her, meagre, resources, keeping, herself, warm, during, cold, winters, by, wearing, all, the, clothes, she, had, she, focused, so, hard, on, her, studies, that, she, sometimes, forgot, to, eat, sk, odowska, studied, during, the, day, and, tutored, evenings, barely, earning, her, keep, in, 1893, she, was, awarded, a, degree, in, physics, and, began, work, in, an, industrial, laboratory, of, gabriel, lippmann, meanwhile, she, continued, studying, at, the, university, of, paris, and, with, the, aid, of, a, fellowship, she, was, able, to, earn, a, second, degree, in, 1894, sk, odowska, had, begun, her, scientific, career, in, paris, with, an, investigation, of, the, magnetic, properties, of, various, steels, commissioned, by, the, society, for, the, encouragement, of, national, industry, that, same, year, pierre, curie, entered, her, life, it, was, their, mutual, interest, in, natural, sciences, that, drew, them, together, pierre, curie, was, an, instructor, at, the, city, of, paris, industrial, physics, and, chemistry, higher, educational, institution, espci, paris, they, were, introduced, by, polish, physicist, j, zef, wierusz, kowalski, who, had, learned, that, she, was, looking, for, a, larger, laboratory, space, something, that, wierusz, kowalski, thought, pierre, could, access, though, curie, did, not, have, a, large, laboratory, he, was, able, to, find, some, space, for, sk, odowska, where, she, was, able, to, begin, work, their, mutual, passion, for, science, brought, them, increasingly, closer, and, they, began, to, develop, feelings, for, one, another, eventually, pierre, proposed, marriage, but, at, first, sk, odowska, did, not, accept, as, she, was, still, planning, to, go, back, to, her, native, country, curie, however, declared, that, he, was, ready, to, move, with, her, to, poland, even, if, it, meant, being, reduced, to, teaching, french, meanwhile, for, the, 1894, summer, break, sk, odowska, returned, to, warsaw, where, she, visited, her, family, she, was, still, labouring, under, the, illusion, that, she, would, be, able, to, work, in, her, chosen, field, in, poland, but, she, was, denied, a, place, at, krak, w, university, because, of, sexism, in, academia, a, letter, from, pierre, convinced, her, to, return, to, paris, to, pursue, a, phd, at, sk, odowska, s, insistence, curie, had, written, up, his, research, on, magnetism, and, received, his, own, doctorate, in, march, 1895, he, was, also, promoted, to, professor, at, the, school, a, contemporary, quip, would, call, sk, odowska, pierre, s, biggest, discovery, on, 26, july, 1895, they, were, married, in, sceaux, neither, wanted, a, religious, service, curie, s, dark, blue, outfit, worn, instead, of, a, bridal, gown, would, serve, her, for, many, years, as, a, laboratory, outfit, they, shared, two, pastimes, long, bicycle, trips, and, journeys, abroad, which, brought, them, even, closer, in, pierre, marie, had, found, a, new, love, a, partner, and, a, scientific, collaborator, on, whom, she, could, depend, in, 1895, wilhelm, r, ntgen, discovered, the, existence, of, x, rays, though, the, mechanism, behind, their, production, was, not, yet, understood, in, 1896, henri, becquerel, discovered, that, uranium, salts, emitted, rays, that, resembled, x, rays, in, their, penetrating, power, he, demonstrated, that, this, radiation, unlike, phosphorescence, did, not, depend, on, an, external, source, of, energy, but, seemed, to, arise, spontaneously, from, uranium, itself, influenced, by, these, two, important, discoveries, curie, decided, to, look, into, uranium, rays, as, a, possible, field, of, research, for, a, thesis, she, used, an, innovative, technique, to, investigate, samples, fifteen, years, earlier, her, husband, and, his, brother, had, developed, a, version, of, the, electrometer, a, sensitive, device, for, measuring, electric, charge, using, her, husband, s, electrometer, she, discovered, that, uranium, rays, caused, the, air, around, a, sample, to, conduct, electricity, using, this, technique, her, first, result, was, the, finding, that, the, activity, of, the, uranium, compounds, depended, only, on, the, quantity, of, uranium, present, she, hypothesized, that, the, radiation, was, not, the, outcome, of, some, interaction, of, molecules, but, must, come, from, the, atom, itself, this, hypothesis, was, an, important, step, in, disproving, the, assumption, that, atoms, were, indivisible, in, 1897, her, daughter, ir, ne, was, born, to, support, her, family, curie, began, teaching, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, the, curies, did, not, have, a, dedicated, laboratory, most, of, their, research, was, carried, out, in, a, converted, shed, next, to, espci, the, shed, formerly, a, medical, school, dissecting, room, was, poorly, ventilated, and, not, even, waterproof, they, were, unaware, of, the, deleterious, effects, of, radiation, exposure, attendant, on, their, continued, unprotected, work, with, radioactive, substances, espci, did, not, sponsor, her, research, but, she, would, receive, subsidies, from, metallurgical, and, mining, companies, and, from, various, organizations, and, governments, curie, s, systematic, studies, included, two, uranium, minerals, pitchblende, and, torbernite, also, known, as, chalcolite, her, electrometer, showed, that, pitchblende, was, four, times, as, active, as, uranium, itself, and, chalcolite, twice, as, active, she, concluded, that, if, her, earlier, results, relating, the, quantity, of, uranium, to, its, activity, were, correct, then, these, two, minerals, must, contain, small, quantities, of, another, substance, that, was, far, more, active, than, uranium, she, began, a, systematic, search, for, additional, substances, that, emit, radiation, and, by, 1898, she, discovered, that, the, element, thorium, was, also, radioactive, pierre, curie, was, increasingly, intrigued, by, her, work, by, mid, 1898, he, was, so, invested, in, it, that, he, decided, to, drop, his, work, on, crystals, and, to, join, her, the, idea, was, her, own, no, one, helped, her, formulate, it, and, although, she, took, it, to, her, husband, for, his, opinion, she, clearly, established, her, ownership, of, it, she, later, recorded, the, fact, twice, in, her, biography, of, her, husband, to, ensure, there, was, no, chance, whatever, of, any, ambiguity, it, likely, that, already, at, this, early, stage, of, her, career, realized, that, many, scientists, would, find, it, difficult, to, believe, that, a, woman, could, be, capable, of, the, original, work, in, which, she, was, involved, she, was, acutely, aware, of, the, importance, of, promptly, publishing, her, discoveries, and, thus, establishing, her, priority, had, not, becquerel, two, years, earlier, presented, his, discovery, to, the, acad, mie, des, sciences, the, day, after, he, made, it, credit, for, the, discovery, of, radioactivity, and, even, a, nobel, prize, would, instead, have, gone, to, silvanus, thompson, curie, chose, the, same, rapid, means, of, publication, her, paper, giving, a, brief, and, simple, account, of, her, work, was, presented, for, her, to, the, acad, mie, on, 12, april, 1898, by, her, former, professor, gabriel, lippmann, even, so, just, as, thompson, had, been, beaten, by, becquerel, so, curie, was, beaten, in, the, race, to, tell, of, her, discovery, that, thorium, gives, off, rays, in, the, same, way, as, uranium, two, months, earlier, gerhard, carl, schmidt, had, published, his, own, finding, in, berlin, at, that, time, no, one, else, in, the, world, of, physics, had, noticed, what, curie, recorded, in, a, sentence, of, her, paper, describing, how, much, greater, were, the, activities, of, pitchblende, and, chalcolite, than, uranium, itself, the, fact, is, very, remarkable, and, leads, to, the, belief, that, these, minerals, may, contain, an, element, which, is, much, more, active, than, uranium, she, later, would, recall, how, she, felt, a, passionate, desire, to, verify, this, hypothesis, as, rapidly, as, possible, on, 14, april, 1898, the, curies, optimistically, weighed, out, a, 100, gram, sample, of, pitchblende, and, ground, it, with, a, pestle, and, mortar, they, did, not, realize, at, the, time, that, what, they, were, searching, for, was, present, in, such, minute, quantities, that, they, would, eventually, have, to, process, tonnes, of, the, ore, in, july, 1898, curie, and, her, husband, published, a, joint, paper, announcing, the, existence, of, an, element, they, named, polonium, in, honour, of, her, native, poland, which, would, for, another, twenty, years, remain, partitioned, among, three, empires, russian, austrian, and, prussian, on, 26, december, 1898, the, curies, announced, the, existence, of, a, second, element, which, they, named, radium, from, the, latin, word, for, ray, in, the, course, of, their, research, they, also, coined, the, word, radioactivity, to, prove, their, discoveries, beyond, any, doubt, the, curies, sought, to, isolate, polonium, and, radium, in, pure, form, pitchblende, is, a, complex, mineral, the, chemical, separation, of, its, constituents, was, an, arduous, task, the, discovery, of, polonium, had, been, relatively, easy, chemically, it, resembles, the, element, bismuth, and, polonium, was, the, only, bismuth, like, substance, in, the, ore, radium, however, was, more, elusive, it, is, closely, related, chemically, to, barium, and, pitchblende, contains, both, elements, by, 1898, the, curies, had, obtained, traces, of, radium, but, appreciable, quantities, uncontaminated, with, barium, were, still, beyond, reach, the, curies, undertook, the, arduous, task, of, separating, out, radium, salt, by, differential, crystallization, from, a, tonne, of, pitchblende, one, tenth, of, a, gram, of, radium, chloride, was, separated, in, 1902, in, 1910, she, isolated, pure, radium, metal, she, never, succeeded, in, isolating, polonium, which, has, a, half, life, of, only, 138, days, between, 1898, and, 1902, the, curies, published, jointly, or, separately, a, total, of, 32, scientific, papers, including, one, that, announced, that, when, exposed, to, radium, diseased, tumour, forming, cells, were, destroyed, faster, than, healthy, cells, in, 1900, curie, became, the, first, woman, faculty, member, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, and, her, husband, joined, the, faculty, of, the, university, of, paris, in, 1902, she, visited, poland, on, the, occasion, of, her, father, s, death, in, june, 1903, supervised, by, gabriel, lippmann, curie, was, awarded, her, doctorate, from, the, university, of, paris, that, month, the, couple, were, invited, to, the, royal, institution, in, london, to, give, a, speech, on, radioactivity, being, a, woman, she, was, prevented, from, speaking, and, pierre, curie, alone, was, allowed, to, meanwhile, a, new, industry, began, developing, based, on, radium, the, curies, did, not, patent, their, discovery, and, benefited, little, from, this, increasingly, profitable, business, in, december, 1903, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, awarded, pierre, curie, marie, curie, and, henri, becquerel, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, recognition, of, the, extraordinary, services, they, have, rendered, by, their, joint, researches, on, the, radiation, phenomena, discovered, by, professor, henri, becquerel, at, first, the, committee, had, intended, to, honour, only, pierre, curie, and, henri, becquerel, but, a, committee, member, and, advocate, for, women, scientists, swedish, mathematician, magnus, g, sta, mittag, leffler, alerted, pierre, to, the, situation, and, after, his, complaint, marie, s, name, was, added, to, the, nomination, marie, curie, was, the, first, woman, to, be, awarded, a, nobel, prize, curie, and, her, husband, declined, to, go, to, stockholm, to, receive, the, prize, in, person, they, were, too, busy, with, their, work, and, pierre, curie, who, disliked, public, ceremonies, was, feeling, increasingly, ill, as, nobel, laureates, were, required, to, deliver, a, lecture, the, curies, finally, undertook, the, trip, in, 1905, the, award, money, allowed, the, curies, to, hire, their, first, laboratory, assistant, following, the, award, of, the, nobel, prize, and, galvanized, by, an, offer, from, the, university, of, geneva, which, offered, pierre, curie, a, position, the, university, of, paris, gave, him, a, professorship, and, the, chair, of, physics, although, the, curies, still, did, not, have, a, proper, laboratory, upon, pierre, curie, s, complaint, the, university, of, paris, relented, and, agreed, to, furnish, a, new, laboratory, but, it, would, not, be, ready, until, 1906, in, december, 1904, curie, gave, birth, to, their, second, daughter, ve, she, hired, polish, governesses, to, teach, her, daughters, her, native, language, and, sent, or, took, them, on, visits, to, poland, on, 19, april, 1906, pierre, curie, was, killed, in, a, road, accident, walking, across, the, rue, dauphine, in, heavy, rain, he, was, struck, by, a, horse, drawn, vehicle, and, fell, under, its, wheels, fracturing, his, skull, and, killing, him, instantly, curie, was, devastated, by, her, husband, s, death, on, 13, may, 1906, the, physics, department, of, the, university, of, paris, decided, to, retain, the, chair, that, had, been, created, for, her, late, husband, and, offer, it, to, marie, she, accepted, it, hoping, to, create, a, world, class, laboratory, as, a, tribute, to, her, husband, pierre, she, was, the, first, woman, to, become, a, professor, at, the, university, of, paris, curie, s, quest, to, create, a, new, laboratory, did, not, end, with, the, university, of, paris, however, in, her, later, years, she, headed, the, radium, institute, institut, du, radium, now, curie, institute, institut, curie, a, radioactivity, laboratory, created, for, her, by, the, pasteur, institute, and, the, university, of, paris, the, initiative, for, creating, the, radium, institute, had, come, in, 1909, from, pierre, paul, mile, roux, director, of, the, pasteur, institute, who, had, been, disappointed, that, the, university, of, paris, was, not, giving, curie, a, proper, laboratory, and, had, suggested, that, she, move, to, the, pasteur, institute, only, then, with, the, threat, of, curie, leaving, did, the, university, of, paris, relent, and, eventually, the, curie, pavilion, became, a, joint, initiative, of, the, university, of, paris, and, the, pasteur, institute, in, 1910, curie, succeeded, in, isolating, radium, she, also, defined, an, international, standard, for, radioactive, emissions, that, was, eventually, named, for, her, and, pierre, the, curie, nevertheless, in, 1911, the, french, academy, of, sciences, failed, by, one, or, two, votes, to, elect, her, to, membership, in, the, academy, elected, instead, was, douard, branly, an, inventor, who, had, helped, guglielmo, marconi, develop, the, wireless, telegraph, it, was, only, over, half, a, century, later, in, 1962, that, a, doctoral, student, of, curie, s, marguerite, perey, became, the, first, woman, elected, to, membership, in, the, academy, despite, curie, s, fame, as, a, scientist, working, for, france, the, public, s, attitude, tended, toward, xenophobia, the, same, that, had, led, to, the, dreyfus, affair, which, also, fuelled, false, speculation, that, curie, was, jewish, during, the, french, academy, of, sciences, elections, she, was, vilified, by, the, right, wing, press, as, a, foreigner, and, atheist, her, daughter, later, remarked, on, the, french, press, s, hypocrisy, in, portraying, curie, as, an, unworthy, foreigner, when, she, was, nominated, for, a, french, honour, but, portraying, her, as, a, french, heroine, when, she, received, foreign, honours, such, as, her, nobel, prizes, in, 1911, it, was, revealed, that, curie, was, involved, in, a, year, long, affair, with, physicist, paul, langevin, a, former, student, of, pierre, curie, s, a, married, man, who, was, estranged, from, his, wife, this, resulted, in, a, press, scandal, that, was, exploited, by, her, academic, opponents, curie, then, in, her, mid, 40s, was, five, years, older, than, langevin, and, was, misrepresented, in, the, tabloids, as, a, foreign, jewish, home, wrecker, when, the, scandal, broke, she, was, away, at, a, conference, in, belgium, on, her, return, she, found, an, angry, mob, in, front, of, her, house, and, had, to, seek, refuge, with, her, daughters, in, the, home, of, her, friend, camille, marbo, international, recognition, for, her, work, had, been, growing, to, new, heights, and, the, royal, swedish, academy, of, sciences, overcoming, opposition, prompted, by, the, langevin, scandal, honoured, her, a, second, time, with, the, 1911, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, this, award, was, in, recognition, of, her, services, to, the, advancement, of, chemistry, by, the, discovery, of, the, elements, radium, and, polonium, by, the, isolation, of, radium, and, the, study, of, the, nature, and, compounds, of, this, remarkable, element, because, of, the, negative, publicity, due, to, her, affair, with, langevin, the, chair, of, the, nobel, committee, svante, arrhenius, attempted, to, prevent, her, attendance, at, the, official, ceremony, for, her, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, citing, her, questionable, moral, standing, curie, replied, that, she, would, be, present, at, the, ceremony, because, the, prize, has, been, given, to, her, for, her, discovery, of, polonium, and, radium, and, that, there, is, no, relation, between, her, scientific, work, and, the, facts, of, her, private, life, she, was, the, first, person, to, win, or, share, two, nobel, prizes, and, remains, alone, with, linus, pauling, as, nobel, laureates, in, two, fields, each, a, delegation, of, celebrated, polish, men, of, learning, headed, by, novelist, henryk, sienkiewicz, encouraged, her, to, return, to, poland, and, continue, her, research, in, her, native, country, curie, s, second, nobel, prize, enabled, her, to, persuade, the, french, government, to, support, the, radium, institute, built, in, 1914, where, research, was, conducted, in, chemistry, physics, and, medicine, a, month, after, accepting, her, 1911, nobel, prize, she, was, hospitalised, with, depression, and, a, kidney, ailment, for, most, of, 1912, she, avoided, public, life, but, did, spend, time, in, england, with, her, friend, and, fellow, physicist, hertha, ayrton, she, returned, to, her, laboratory, only, in, december, after, a, break, of, about, 14, months, in, 1912, the, warsaw, scientific, society, offered, her, the, directorship, of, a, new, laboratory, in, warsaw, but, she, declined, focusing, on, the, developing, radium, institute, to, be, completed, in, august, 1914, and, on, a, new, street, named, rue, pierre, curie, today, rue, pierre, et, marie, curie, she, was, appointed, director, of, the, curie, laboratory, in, the, radium, institute, of, the, university, of, paris, founded, in, 1914, she, visited, poland, in, 1913, and, was, welcomed, in, warsaw, but, the, visit, was, mostly, ignored, by, the, russian, authorities, the, institute, s, development, was, interrupted, by, the, coming, war, as, most, researchers, were, drafted, into, the, french, army, and, it, fully, resumed, its, activities, in, 1919, during, world, war, i, curie, recognised, that, wounded, soldiers, were, best, served, if, operated, upon, as, soon, as, possible, she, saw, a, need, for, field, radiological, centres, near, the, front, lines, to, assist, battlefield, surgeons, including, to, obviate, amputations, when, in, fact, limbs, could, be, saved, after, a, quick, study, of, radiology, anatomy, and, automotive, mechanics, she, procured, x, ray, equipment, vehicles, and, auxiliary, generators, and, she, developed, mobile, radiography, units, which, came, to, be, popularly, known, as, petites, curies, little, curies, she, became, the, director, of, the, red, cross, radiology, service, and, set, up, france, s, first, military, radiology, centre, operational, by, late, 1914, assisted, at, first, by, a, military, doctor, and, her, 17, year, old, daughter, ir, ne, curie, directed, the, installation, of, 20, mobile, radiological, vehicles, and, another, 200, radiological, units, at, field, hospitals, in, the, first, year, of, the, war, later, she, began, training, other, women, as, aides, in, 1915, curie, produced, hollow, needles, containing, radium, emanation, a, colourless, radioactive, gas, given, off, by, radium, later, identified, as, radon, to, be, used, for, sterilizing, infected, tissue, she, provided, the, radium, from, her, own, one, gram, supply, it, is, estimated, that, over, a, million, wounded, soldiers, were, treated, with, her, x, ray, units, busy, with, this, work, she, carried, out, very, little, scientific, research, during, that, period, in, spite, of, all, her, humanitarian, contributions, to, the, french, war, effort, curie, never, received, any, formal, recognition, of, it, from, the, french, government, also, promptly, after, the, war, started, she, attempted, to, donate, her, gold, nobel, prize, medals, to, the, war, effort, but, the, french, national, bank, refused, to, accept, them, she, did, buy, war, bonds, using, her, nobel, prize, money, she, said, i, am, going, to, give, up, the, little, gold, i, possess, i, shall, add, to, this, the, scientific, medals, which, are, quite, useless, to, me, there, is, something, else, by, sheer, laziness, i, had, allowed, the, money, for, my, second, nobel, prize, to, remain, in, stockholm, in, swedish, crowns, this, is, the, chief, part, of, what, we, possess, i, should, like, to, bring, it, back, here, and, invest, it, in, war, loans, the, state, needs, it, only, i, have, no, illusions, this, money, will, probably, be, lost, she, was, also, an, active, member, in, committees, of, polonia, in, france, dedicated, to, the, polish, cause, after, the, war, she, summarized, her, wartime, experiences, in, a, book, radiology, in, war, 1919, in, 1920, for, the, 25th, anniversary, of, the, discovery, of, radium, the, french, government, established, a, stipend, for, her, its, previous, recipient, was, louis, pasteur, who, had, died, in, 1895, in, 1921, she, was, welcomed, triumphantly, when, she, toured, the, united, states, to, raise, funds, for, research, on, radium, mrs, william, brown, meloney, after, interviewing, curie, created, a, marie, curie, radium, fund, and, raised, money, to, buy, radium, publicising, her, trip, in, 1921, u, s, president, warren, g, harding, received, her, at, the, white, house, to, present, her, with, the, 1, gram, of, radium, collected, in, the, united, states, and, the, first, lady, praised, her, as, an, example, of, a, professional, achiever, who, was, also, a, supportive, wife, before, the, meeting, recognising, her, growing, fame, abroad, and, embarrassed, by, the, fact, that, she, had, no, french, official, distinctions, to, wear, in, public, the, french, government, offered, her, a, legion, of, honour, award, but, she, refused, in, 1922, she, became, a, fellow, of, the, french, academy, of, medicine, she, also, travelled, to, other, countries, appearing, publicly, and, giving, lectures, in, belgium, brazil, spain, and, czechoslovakia, led, by, curie, the, institute, produced, four, more, nobel, prize, winners, including, her, daughter, ir, ne, joliot, curie, and, her, son, in, law, fr, d, ric, joliot, curie, eventually, it, became, one, of, the, world, s, four, major, radioactivity, research, laboratories, the, others, being, the, cavendish, laboratory, with, ernest, rutherford, the, institute, for, radium, research, vienna, with, stefan, meyer, and, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, chemistry, with, otto, hahn, and, lise, meitner, in, august, 1922, marie, curie, became, a, member, of, the, league, of, nations, newly, created, international, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, she, sat, on, the, committee, until, 1934, and, contributed, to, league, of, nations, scientific, coordination, with, other, prominent, researchers, such, as, albert, einstein, hendrik, lorentz, and, henri, bergson, in, 1923, she, wrote, a, biography, of, her, late, husband, titled, pierre, curie, in, 1925, she, visited, poland, to, participate, in, a, ceremony, laying, the, foundations, for, warsaw, s, radium, institute, her, second, american, tour, in, 1929, succeeded, in, equipping, the, warsaw, radium, institute, with, radium, the, institute, opened, in, 1932, with, her, sister, bronis, awa, its, director, these, distractions, from, her, scientific, labours, and, the, attendant, publicity, caused, her, much, discomfort, but, provided, resources, for, her, work, in, 1930, she, was, elected, to, the, international, atomic, weights, committee, on, which, she, served, until, her, death, in, 1931, curie, was, awarded, the, cameron, prize, for, therapeutics, of, the, university, of, edinburgh, curie, visited, poland, for, the, last, time, in, early, 1934, a, few, months, later, on, 4, july, 1934, she, died, aged, 66, at, the, sancellemoz, sanatorium, in, passy, haute, savoie, from, aplastic, anemia, believed, to, have, been, contracted, from, her, long, term, exposure, to, radiation, causing, damage, to, her, bone, marrow, the, damaging, effects, of, ionising, radiation, were, not, known, at, the, time, of, her, work, which, had, been, carried, out, without, the, safety, measures, later, developed, she, had, carried, test, tubes, containing, radioactive, isotopes, in, her, pocket, and, she, stored, them, in, her, desk, drawer, remarking, on, the, faint, light, that, the, substances, gave, off, in, the, dark, curie, was, also, exposed, to, x, rays, from, unshielded, equipment, while, serving, as, a, radiologist, in, field, hospitals, during, the, first, world, war, when, curie, s, body, was, exhumed, in, 1995, the, french, office, de, protection, contre, les, rayonnements, ionisants, opri, concluded, that, she, could, not, have, been, exposed, to, lethal, levels, of, radium, while, she, was, alive, they, pointed, out, that, radium, poses, a, risk, only, if, it, is, ingested, and, speculated, that, her, illness, was, more, likely, to, have, been, due, to, her, use, of, radiography, during, the, first, world, war, she, was, interred, at, the, cemetery, in, sceaux, alongside, her, husband, pierre, sixty, years, later, in, 1995, in, honour, of, their, achievements, the, remains, of, both, were, transferred, to, the, paris, panth, on, their, remains, were, sealed, in, a, lead, lining, because, of, the, radioactivity, she, became, the, second, woman, to, be, interred, at, the, panth, on, after, sophie, berthelot, and, the, first, woman, to, be, honoured, with, interment, in, the, panth, on, on, her, own, merits, because, of, their, levels, of, radioactive, contamination, her, papers, from, the, 1890s, are, considered, too, dangerous, to, handle, even, her, cookbooks, are, highly, radioactive, her, papers, are, kept, in, lead, lined, boxes, and, those, who, wish, to, consult, them, must, wear, protective, clothing, in, her, last, year, she, worked, on, a, book, radioactivity, which, was, published, posthumously, in, 1935, the, physical, and, societal, aspects, of, the, curies, work, contributed, to, shaping, the, world, of, the, twentieth, and, twenty, first, centuries, cornell, university, professor, l, pearce, williams, observes, the, result, of, the, curies, work, was, epoch, making, radium, s, radioactivity, was, so, great, that, it, could, not, be, ignored, it, seemed, to, contradict, the, principle, of, the, conservation, of, energy, and, therefore, forced, a, reconsideration, of, the, foundations, of, physics, on, the, experimental, level, the, discovery, of, radium, provided, men, like, ernest, rutherford, with, sources, of, radioactivity, with, which, they, could, probe, the, structure, of, the, atom, as, a, result, of, rutherford, s, experiments, with, alpha, radiation, the, nuclear, atom, was, first, postulated, in, medicine, the, radioactivity, of, radium, appeared, to, offer, a, means, by, which, cancer, could, be, successfully, attacked, in, addition, to, helping, to, overturn, established, ideas, in, physics, and, chemistry, curie, s, work, has, had, a, profound, effect, in, the, societal, sphere, to, attain, her, scientific, achievements, she, had, to, overcome, barriers, in, both, her, native, and, her, adoptive, country, that, were, placed, in, her, way, because, she, was, a, woman, she, was, known, for, her, honesty, and, moderate, lifestyle, having, received, a, small, scholarship, in, 1893, she, returned, it, in, 1897, as, soon, as, she, began, earning, her, keep, she, gave, much, of, her, first, nobel, prize, money, to, friends, family, students, and, research, associates, in, an, unusual, decision, curie, intentionally, refrained, from, patenting, the, radium, isolation, process, so, that, the, scientific, community, could, do, research, unhindered, she, insisted, that, monetary, gifts, and, awards, be, given, to, the, scientific, institutions, she, was, affiliated, with, rather, than, to, her, she, and, her, husband, often, refused, awards, and, medals, albert, einstein, reportedly, remarked, that, she, was, probably, the, only, person, who, could, not, be, corrupted, by, fame, as, one, of, the, most, famous, scientists, in, history, marie, curie, has, become, an, icon, in, the, scientific, world, and, has, received, tributes, from, across, the, globe, even, in, the, realm, of, pop, culture, she, also, received, many, honorary, degrees, from, universities, across, the, world, marie, curie, was, the, first, woman, to, win, a, nobel, prize, the, first, person, to, win, two, nobel, prizes, the, only, woman, to, win, in, two, fields, and, the, only, person, to, win, in, multiple, sciences, awards, and, honours, that, she, received, include, entities, that, have, been, named, after, marie, curie, include, numerous, biographies, are, devoted, to, her, including, marie, curie, has, been, the, subject, of, a, number, of, films, curie, is, the, subject, of, the, 2013, play, false, assumptions, by, lawrence, aronovitch, in, which, the, ghosts, of, three, other, women, scientists, observe, events, in, her, life, curie, has, also, been, portrayed, by, susan, marie, frontczak, in, her, play, manya, the, living, history, of, marie, curie, a, one, woman, show, which, by, 2014, had, been, performed, in, 30, u, s, states, and, nine, countries, lauren, gunderson, s, 2019, play, the, half, life, of, marie, curie, portrays, curie, during, the, summer, after, her, 1911, nobel, prize, victory, when, she, was, grappling, with, depression, and, facing, public, scorn, over, the, revelation, of, her, affair, with, paul, langevin, curie, has, appeared, on, more, than, 600, postage, stamps, in, many, countries, across, the, world, between, 1989, and, 1996, she, was, featured, on, a, 20, 000, zloty, banknote, designed, by, andrzej, heidrich, in, 2011, a, commemorative, 20, zloty, banknote, depicting, curie, was, issued, by, the, national, bank, of, poland, on, the, 100th, anniversary, of, the, scientist, receiving, the, nobel, prize, in, chemistry, in, 1994, the, bank, of, france, issued, a, 500, franc, banknote, featuring, marie, and, pierre, curie, as, of, the, middle, of, 2024, curie, is, depicted, on, french, 50, euro, cent, coins, to, commemorate, her, importance, in, french, history
