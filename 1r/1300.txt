composer, and, considerable, patron, of, music, leopold, s, reign, is, known, for, conflicts, with, the, ottoman, empire, in, the, great, turkish, war, 1683, 1699, and, rivalry, with, louis, xiv, a, contemporary, and, first, cousin, on, the, maternal, side, fourth, cousin, on, the, paternal, side, in, the, west, after, more, than, a, decade, of, warfare, leopold, emerged, victorious, in, the, east, thanks, to, the, military, talents, of, prince, eugene, of, savoy, by, the, treaty, of, karlowitz, leopold, recovered, almost, all, of, the, kingdom, of, hungary, which, had, fallen, under, turkish, power, in, the, years, after, the, 1526, battle, of, moh, cs, leopold, fought, three, wars, against, france, the, franco, dutch, war, the, nine, years, war, and, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, in, this, last, leopold, sought, to, give, his, younger, son, charles, the, entire, spanish, inheritance, disregarding, the, will, of, the, late, charles, ii, leopold, started, a, war, that, soon, engulfed, much, of, europe, the, early, years, of, the, war, went, fairly, well, for, austria, with, victories, at, schellenberg, and, blenheim, but, the, war, would, drag, on, until, 1714, nine, years, after, leopold, s, death, which, barely, had, an, effect, on, the, warring, states, when, peace, returned, with, the, treaty, of, rastatt, austria, could, not, be, said, to, have, emerged, as, triumphant, as, it, had, from, the, war, against, the, turks, born, on, 9, june, 1640, in, vienna, leopold, received, the, traditional, program, of, education, in, the, liberal, arts, history, literature, natural, science, and, astronomy, he, was, particularly, interested, in, music, as, his, father, emperor, ferdinand, iii, had, been, from, an, early, age, leopold, showed, an, inclination, toward, learning, he, became, fluent, in, latin, italian, german, and, spanish, in, addition, to, german, italian, would, be, the, most, favored, language, at, his, court, likewise, he, had, received, comprehensive, ecclesiastical, training, as, he, had, originally, been, selected, for, a, career, in, the, higher, clergy, this, plan, though, was, dropped, upon, the, 1654, death, of, his, older, brother, ferdinand, iv, when, leopold, became, heir, apparent, nonetheless, leopold, s, spiritual, education, had, had, a, manifest, impact, on, him, leopold, remained, under, the, spell, of, his, clerical, education, and, jesuit, influence, throughout, his, life, for, a, monarch, he, was, uncommonly, knowledgeable, about, theology, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and, the, sciences, he, also, retained, his, interest, in, astrology, and, alchemy, which, he, had, developed, under, jesuit, tutors, a, deeply, religious, and, devoted, person, leopold, personified, the, pietas, austriaca, or, the, loyal, catholic, attitude, of, his, house, on, the, other, hand, his, piety, and, education, may, have, caused, in, him, a, fatalistic, strain, which, inclined, him, to, reject, all, compromise, on, denominational, questions, which, is, not, always, considered, a, positive, characteristic, of, a, ruler, leopold, was, said, to, have, typical, habsburg, physical, attributes, such, as, the, prominent, habsburg, lower, jaw, short, thin, and, of, sick, constitution, leopold, was, cold, and, reserved, in, public, and, socially, inept, however, he, is, also, said, to, have, been, open, with, close, associates, coxe, described, leopold, in, the, following, manner, his, gait, was, stately, slow, and, deliberate, his, air, pensive, his, address, awkward, his, manner, uncouth, his, disposition, cold, and, phlegmatic, spielman, argues, that, his, long, expected, career, in, the, clergy, caused, leopold, to, have, early, adopted, the, intense, catholic, piety, expected, of, him, and, the, gentle, manners, appropriate, to, a, merely, supporting, role, he, grew, to, manhood, without, the, military, ambition, that, characterized, most, of, his, fellow, monarchs, from, the, beginning, his, reign, was, defensive, and, profoundly, conservative, elected, king, of, hungary, in, 1655, he, followed, suit, in, 1656, and, 1657, in, bohemia, and, croatia, respectively, in, july, 1658, more, than, a, year, after, his, father, s, death, leopold, was, elected, holy, roman, emperor, at, frankfurt, in, opposition, to, the, french, cardinal, mazarin, who, sought, to, place, the, imperial, crown, on, the, head, of, ferdinand, maria, elector, of, bavaria, or, some, other, non, habsburg, prince, to, conciliate, france, which, had, considerable, influence, in, german, affairs, thanks, to, the, league, of, the, rhine, the, newly, elected, emperor, promised, not, to, assist, spain, then, at, war, with, france, this, marked, the, beginning, of, a, nearly, 47, year, reign, characterized, by, a, lasting, rivalry, with, france, and, its, king, louis, xiv, the, latter, s, dominant, personality, and, power, completely, overshadowed, leopold, even, to, this, day, but, leopold, was, no, less, a, warrior, king, given, the, greater, part, of, his, public, life, was, directed, towards, the, arrangement, and, furtherance, of, wars, leopold, s, first, war, was, the, second, northern, war, 1655, 1660, in, which, king, charles, x, of, sweden, tried, to, become, king, of, poland, with, the, aid, of, allies, including, gy, rgy, ii, r, k, czi, prince, of, transylvania, leopold, s, predecessor, ferdinand, iii, had, allied, with, king, john, ii, casimir, vasa, of, poland, in, 1656, in, 1657, leopold, expanded, this, alliance, to, include, austrian, troops, paid, by, poland, these, troops, helped, defeat, the, transylvanian, army, and, campaigned, as, far, as, denmark, the, war, ended, with, the, treaty, of, oliwa, in, 1660, the, ottoman, empire, often, interfered, in, the, affairs, of, transylvania, always, an, unruly, state, and, this, interference, brought, on, a, war, with, the, holy, roman, empire, which, after, some, desultory, operations, really, began, in, 1663, by, a, personal, appeal, to, the, diet, at, regensburg, leopold, induced, the, princes, to, send, assistance, for, the, campaign, troops, were, also, sent, by, france, and, in, august, 1664, the, great, imperial, general, raimondo, montecuccoli, gained, a, notable, victory, at, saint, gotthard, by, the, peace, of, vasv, r, the, emperor, made, a, twenty, years, truce, with, the, sultan, granting, more, generous, terms, than, his, recent, victory, seemed, to, render, necessary, french, expansion, increasingly, threatened, the, empire, especially, the, seizure, of, the, strategic, duchy, of, lorraine, in, 1670, followed, by, the, 1672, franco, dutch, war, by, mid, june, the, dutch, republic, teetered, at, the, brink, of, destruction, which, led, leopold, to, agree, to, an, alliance, with, brandenburg, prussia, and, the, republic, on, 25, june, however, he, was, also, facing, a, revolt, in, hungary, and, viewed, french, conquests, in, the, rhineland, a, higher, priority, than, helping, the, dutch, his, commander, raimondo, montecuccoli, was, ordered, to, remain, on, the, defensive, and, avoid, a, direct, conflict, chaotic, logistics, made, it, impossible, to, maintain, the, troops, and, brandenburg, left, the, war, in, june, 1673, under, the, treaty, of, vossem, an, anti, french, quadruple, alliance, was, formed, in, august, consisting, of, the, dutch, republic, spain, emperor, leopold, and, the, duke, of, lorraine, while, in, may, 1674, the, imperial, diet, declared, it, an, imperial, war, the, 1678, treaty, of, nijmegen, is, generally, seen, as, a, french, victory, although, the, alliance, succeeded, in, limiting, their, gains, almost, immediately, after, the, conclusion, of, peace, louis, renewed, his, aggressions, on, the, german, frontier, through, the, r, unions, policy, engaged, in, a, serious, struggle, with, the, ottoman, empire, the, emperor, was, again, slow, to, move, and, although, he, joined, the, association, league, against, france, in, 1682, he, was, glad, to, make, a, truce, at, regensburg, two, years, later, the, whole, european, position, was, now, bound, up, with, events, in, england, and, the, tension, lasted, until, 1688, when, william, iii, of, orange, won, the, english, crown, through, the, glorious, revolution, and, louis, invaded, germany, in, may, 1689, the, grand, alliance, was, formed, including, the, emperor, the, kings, of, england, spain, and, denmark, the, elector, of, brandenburg, and, others, and, a, fierce, struggle, against, france, was, waged, throughout, almost, the, whole, of, western, europe, in, general, the, several, campaigns, were, favourable, to, the, allies, and, in, september, 1697, england, spain, and, the, united, provinces, made, peace, with, france, at, the, treaty, of, rijswijk, leopold, refused, to, assent, to, the, treaty, as, he, considered, that, his, allies, had, somewhat, neglected, his, interests, but, in, the, following, month, he, came, to, terms, and, a, number, of, places, were, transferred, from, france, to, the, holy, roman, empire, the, peace, with, france, lasted, for, about, four, years, and, then, europe, was, involved, in, the, war, of, the, spanish, succession, the, king, of, spain, charles, ii, was, a, habsburg, by, descent, and, was, related, by, marriage, to, the, austrian, branch, while, a, similar, tie, bound, him, to, the, royal, house, of, france, he, was, feeble, and, childless, and, attempts, had, been, made, by, the, european, powers, to, arrange, for, a, peaceable, division, of, his, extensive, kingdom, leopold, refused, to, consent, to, any, partition, and, when, in, november, 1700, charles, died, leaving, his, crown, to, philippe, duke, of, anjou, a, grandson, of, louis, xiv, all, hopes, of, a, peaceable, settlement, vanished, under, the, guidance, of, william, iii, a, powerful, league, a, renewed, grand, alliance, was, formed, against, france, of, this, the, emperor, was, a, prominent, member, and, in, 1703, he, transferred, his, claim, on, the, spanish, monarchy, to, his, second, son, archduke, charles, the, early, course, of, the, war, was, not, favorable, to, the, imperialists, but, the, tide, of, defeat, had, been, rolled, back, by, the, great, victory, of, blenheim, before, leopold, died, on, 5, may, 1705, the, emperor, himself, defined, the, guidelines, of, the, politics, johann, weikhard, of, auersperg, was, dismissed, in, 1669, as, the, leading, minister, he, was, followed, by, wenzel, eusebius, prince, of, lobkowicz, both, had, arranged, some, connections, to, france, without, the, knowledge, of, the, emperor, in, 1674, lobkowicz, also, lost, his, appointment, he, also, expelled, jewish, communities, from, his, realm, for, example, the, viennese, jewish, community, which, used, to, live, in, an, area, called, im, werd, across, the, danube, canal, after, the, expulsion, of, the, jewish, population, with, popular, support, the, area, was, renamed, leopoldstadt, as, a, thanksgiving, but, frederick, william, elector, of, brandenburg, issued, an, edict, in, 1677, in, which, he, announced, his, special, protection, for, 50, families, of, these, expelled, jews, in, governing, his, own, lands, leopold, found, his, chief, difficulties, in, hungary, where, unrest, was, caused, partly, by, his, desire, to, crush, protestantism, and, partly, by, the, so, called, magnate, conspiracy, a, rising, was, suppressed, in, 1671, and, for, some, years, hungary, was, treated, with, great, severity, in, 1681, after, another, rising, some, grievances, were, removed, and, a, less, repressive, policy, was, adopted, but, this, did, not, deter, the, hungarians, from, revolting, again, austrian, forces, occupied, the, castle, of, trebi, ov, in, 1675, but, in, 1682, imre, th, k, ly, captured, it, and, then, fled, from, continuous, austrian, attacks, so, they, blew, the, castle, up, leaving, it, in, ruins, they, fled, as, supposedly, hungarian, rebel, troops, under, the, command, of, imre, th, k, ly, cooperating, with, the, turks, and, sacked, the, city, of, bielsko, in, 1682, in, 1692, leopold, gave, up, his, rights, to, the, property, giving, his, rights, by, donation, to, theresia, keglevi, espousing, the, cause, of, the, rebels, sultan, mehmed, iv, sent, an, enormous, army, into, austria, early, in, 1683, this, advanced, almost, unchecked, to, vienna, which, was, besieged, from, july, to, september, while, leopold, took, refuge, at, passau, realizing, the, gravity, of, the, situation, somewhat, tardily, some, of, the, german, princes, among, them, the, electors, of, saxony, and, bavaria, led, their, contingents, to, the, imperial, army, which, was, commanded, by, the, emperor, s, brother, in, law, charles, duke, of, lorraine, but, the, most, redoubtable, of, leopold, s, allies, was, the, king, of, poland, john, iii, sobieski, who, was, already, dreaded, by, the, turks, on, 12, september, 1683, the, allied, army, fell, upon, the, enemy, who, was, completely, routed, and, vienna, was, saved, the, imperial, forces, among, whom, prince, eugene, of, savoy, was, rapidly, becoming, prominent, followed, up, the, victory, with, others, notably, one, near, moh, cs, in, 1687, and, another, at, zenta, in, 1697, and, in, january, 1699, sultan, mustafa, ii, signed, the, treaty, of, karlowitz, by, which, he, ceded, almost, the, whole, of, hungary, including, serbs, in, vojvodina, to, the, habsburg, monarchy, as, the, habsburg, forces, retreated, they, withdrew, 37, 000, serb, families, under, patriarch, arsenije, iii, arnojevi, of, the, serbian, patriarchate, of, pe, in, 1690, and, 1691, emperor, leopold, i, had, conceived, through, a, number, of, edicts, privileges, the, autonomy, of, serbs, in, his, dominions, which, would, last, and, develop, for, more, than, two, centuries, until, its, abolition, in, 1912, before, the, conclusion, of, the, war, however, leopold, had, taken, measures, to, strengthen, his, hold, upon, this, country, in, 1687, the, diet, of, hungary, in, pressburg, now, bratislava, changed, the, constitution, the, right, of, the, habsburgs, to, succeed, to, the, throne, without, election, was, admitted, and, the, emperor, s, elder, son, joseph, i, was, crowned, hereditary, king, of, hungary, the, peace, of, westphalia, in, 1648, had, been, a, political, defeat, for, the, habsburgs, it, ended, the, idea, that, europe, was, a, single, christian, empire, governed, spiritually, by, the, pope, and, temporally, by, the, holy, roman, emperor, moreover, the, treaty, was, devoted, to, parceling, out, land, and, influence, to, the, winners, the, anti, habsburg, alliance, led, by, france, and, sweden, however, the, habsburgs, did, gain, some, benefits, out, of, the, thirty, years, war, the, protestant, aristocracy, in, habsburg, territories, had, been, decimated, and, the, ties, between, vienna, and, the, habsburg, domains, in, bohemia, and, elsewhere, were, greatly, strengthened, these, changes, would, allow, leopold, to, initiate, necessary, political, and, institutional, reforms, during, his, reign, to, develop, somewhat, of, an, absolutist, state, along, french, lines, the, most, important, consequences, of, the, war, was, in, retrospect, to, weaken, the, habsburgs, as, emperors, but, strengthen, them, in, their, own, lands, leopold, was, the, first, to, realize, this, altered, state, of, affairs, and, act, in, accordance, with, it, the, reign, of, leopold, saw, some, important, changes, made, in, the, constitution, of, the, empire, in, 1663, the, imperial, diet, entered, upon, the, last, stage, of, its, existence, and, became, a, body, permanently, in, session, at, regensburg, this, perpetual, diet, would, become, a, vital, tool, for, consolidation, of, habsburg, power, under, leopold, in, 1692, the, duke, of, hanover, was, raised, to, the, rank, of, an, elector, becoming, the, ninth, member, of, the, electoral, college, in, 1700, leopold, greatly, in, need, of, help, for, the, impending, war, with, france, granted, the, title, of, king, in, prussia, to, the, elector, of, brandenburg, the, net, result, of, these, and, similar, changes, was, to, weaken, the, authority, of, the, emperor, over, the, princes, of, the, empire, and, to, compel, him, to, rely, more, and, more, upon, his, position, as, ruler, of, the, austrian, archduchies, and, of, hungary, and, bohemia, leopold, was, a, man, of, industry, and, education, and, during, his, later, years, he, showed, some, political, ability, regarding, himself, as, an, absolute, sovereign, he, was, extremely, tenacious, of, his, rights, greatly, influenced, by, the, jesuits, he, was, a, staunch, proponent, of, the, counter, reformation, in, person, he, was, short, but, strong, and, healthy, although, he, had, no, inclination, for, a, military, life, he, loved, outdoors, exercise, such, as, hunting, and, riding, he, also, had, a, taste, and, talent, for, music, and, composed, several, oratorios, and, suites, of, dances, perhaps, due, to, inbreeding, among, his, progenitors, the, hereditary, habsburg, jaw, was, most, prominent, in, leopold, because, his, jaw, was, depicted, unusually, large, on, a, 1670, silver, coin, leopold, was, nicknamed, the, hogmouth, however, most, collectors, do, not, believe, the, coin, was, an, accurate, depiction, in, 1666, he, married, margaret, theresa, of, spain, 1651, 1673, daughter, of, king, philip, iv, of, spain, who, was, both, his, niece, and, his, first, cousin, she, was, depicted, in, diego, vel, zquez, paintings, sent, from, the, court, of, madrid, to, leopold, as, he, waited, in, vienna, for, his, fianc, e, to, grow, up, leopold, and, margaret, theresa, had, four, children, all, but, one, short, lived, his, second, wife, was, claudia, felicitas, of, austria, who, died, in, 1676, at, the, age, of, 22, neither, of, their, two, daughters, survived, his, third, wife, was, eleonor, magdalene, of, neuburg, they, had, the, following, children, like, his, father, leopold, was, a, patron, of, music, and, a, composer, himself, he, continued, to, enrich, the, court, s, musical, life, by, employing, and, providing, support, for, distinguished, composers, such, as, antonio, bertali, giovanni, bononcini, johann, kaspar, kerll, ferdinand, tobias, richter, alessandro, poglietti, and, johann, fux, leopold, s, surviving, works, show, the, influence, of, bertali, and, viennese, composers, in, general, in, oratorios, and, other, dramatic, works, and, of, johann, heinrich, schmelzer, in, ballets, and, german, comedies, his, sacred, music, is, perhaps, his, most, successful, particularly, missa, angeli, custodis, a, requiem, mass, for, his, first, wife, and, three, lections, composed, for, the, burial, of, his, second, wife, much, of, leopold, s, music, was, published, with, works, by, his, father, and, described, as, works, of, exceeding, high, merit, the, full, titulature, of, leopold, after, he, had, become, emperor, went, as, follows, leopold, i, by, the, grace, of, god, elected, holy, roman, emperor, forever, august, king, of, germany, king, of, hungary, king, of, bohemia, dalmatia, croatia, slavonia, rama, serbia, galicia, lodomeria, cumania, bulgaria, archduke, of, austria, duke,
