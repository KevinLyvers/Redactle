edwards, is, widely, regarded, as, one, of, america, s, most, important, and, original, philosophical, theologians, edwards, theological, work, is, broad, in, scope, but, rooted, in, the, paedobaptist, baptism, of, infants, puritan, heritage, as, exemplified, in, the, westminster, and, savoy, confessions, of, faith, recent, studies, have, emphasized, how, thoroughly, edwards, grounded, his, life, s, work, on, conceptions, of, beauty, harmony, and, ethical, aptness, and, how, central, the, age, of, enlightenment, was, to, his, mindset, edwards, played, a, critical, role, in, shaping, the, first, great, awakening, and, oversaw, some, of, the, first, revivals, in, 1733, 35, at, his, church, in, northampton, massachusetts, his, work, gave, rise, to, a, doctrine, known, as, new, england, theology, edwards, delivered, the, sermon, sinners, in, the, hands, of, an, angry, god, a, classic, of, early, american, literature, during, another, revival, in, 1741, following, george, whitefield, s, tour, of, the, thirteen, colonies, edwards, is, well, known, for, his, many, books, such, as, the, end, for, which, god, created, the, world, and, the, life, of, david, brainerd, which, inspired, thousands, of, missionaries, throughout, the, 19th, century, and, religious, affections, which, many, calvinist, evangelicals, still, read, today, edwards, died, from, a, smallpox, inoculation, shortly, after, beginning, the, presidency, at, the, college, of, new, jersey, in, princeton, jonathan, edwards, was, born, on, october, 5, 1703, the, fifth, of, 11, children, and, only, son, of, timothy, edwards, 1668, 1759, a, minister, at, east, windsor, connecticut, modern, day, south, windsor, who, supplemented, his, salary, by, tutoring, boys, for, college, his, mother, esther, stoddard, 1672, 1771, daughter, of, rev, solomon, stoddard, of, northampton, massachusetts, seems, to, have, been, a, woman, of, unusual, mental, gifts, and, independence, of, character, timothy, edwards, held, at, least, one, person, in, enslavement, in, the, edwards, household, a, black, man, named, ansars, jonathan, was, prepared, for, college, by, his, father, and, elder, sisters, all, of, whom, received, an, excellent, education, his, sister, esther, the, eldest, wrote, a, semi, humorous, tract, on, the, immateriality, of, the, soul, which, has, often, been, mistakenly, attributed, to, jonathan, he, entered, yale, college, in, 1716, at, just, under, the, age, of, 13, in, the, following, year, he, became, acquainted, with, john, locke, s, essay, concerning, human, understanding, which, influenced, him, profoundly, during, his, college, studies, he, kept, notebooks, labeled, the, mind, natural, science, containing, a, discussion, of, the, atomic, theory, the, scriptures, and, miscellanies, had, a, grand, plan, for, a, work, on, natural, and, mental, philosophy, and, drew, up, rules, for, its, composition, he, was, interested, in, natural, history, and, as, a, nerdy, 11, year, old, had, observed, and, written, an, essay, detailing, the, ballooning, behavior, of, some, spiders, edwards, edited, this, text, later, to, match, the, burgeoning, genre, of, scientific, literature, and, his, the, flying, spider, fit, easily, into, the, contemporary, scholarship, on, spiders, although, he, studied, theology, for, two, years, after, his, graduation, from, yale, edwards, continued, to, be, interested, in, science, although, many, european, scientists, and, american, clergymen, found, the, implications, of, science, pushing, them, towards, deism, edwards, believed, the, natural, world, was, evidence, of, god, s, masterful, design, throughout, his, life, edwards, often, went, into, the, woods, as, a, favorite, place, to, pray, and, worship, in, the, beauty, and, solace, of, nature, edwards, was, fascinated, by, the, discoveries, of, isaac, newton, and, other, scientists, of, this, time, period, before, he, started, working, as, a, full, time, pastor, in, northampton, he, wrote, on, various, topics, in, natural, philosophy, including, light, and, optics, in, addition, to, spiders, while, he, worried, about, those, of, his, contemporaries, who, seemed, preoccupied, by, materialism, and, faith, in, reason, alone, he, considered, the, laws, of, nature, to, be, derived, from, god, and, demonstrating, his, wisdom, and, care, edwards, s, written, sermons, and, theological, treatises, emphasize, the, beauty, of, god, and, the, role, of, aesthetics, in, the, spiritual, life, he, is, thought, to, anticipate, a, 20th, century, current, of, theological, aesthetics, represented, by, figures, such, as, hans, urs, von, balthasar, in, 1722, to, 1723, he, was, for, eight, months, an, un, ordained, supply, pastor, a, clergyman, employed, to, preach, and, minister, in, a, church, for, a, definite, time, but, not, settled, as, a, pastor, of, a, small, presbyterian, church, on, william, street, in, new, york, city, the, church, invited, him, to, remain, but, he, declined, the, call, after, spending, two, months, in, study, at, home, in, 1724, 1726, he, was, one, of, the, two, tutors, at, yale, tasked, with, leading, the, college, in, the, absence, of, a, rector, yale, s, previous, rector, timothy, cutler, lost, his, position, when, he, defected, to, the, anglican, church, after, two, years, he, had, not, been, replaced, he, partially, recorded, the, years, 1720, to, 1726, in, his, diary, and, in, his, resolutions, for, his, conduct, which, he, drew, up, at, this, time, he, had, long, been, an, eager, seeker, after, salvation, and, was, not, fully, satisfied, as, to, his, own, conversion, until, an, experience, in, his, last, year, in, college, when, he, lost, his, feeling, that, the, election, of, some, to, salvation, and, of, others, to, eternal, damnation, was, a, horrible, doctrine, and, reckoned, it, exceedingly, pleasant, bright, and, sweet, he, now, took, a, great, and, new, joy, in, taking, in, the, beauties, of, nature, and, delighted, in, the, allegorical, interpretation, of, the, song, of, solomon, balancing, these, mystic, joys, is, the, stern, tone, of, his, resolutions, in, which, he, is, almost, ascetic, in, his, eagerness, to, live, earnestly, and, soberly, to, waste, no, time, to, maintain, the, strictest, temperance, in, eating, and, drinking, on, february, 15, 1727, edwards, was, ordained, minister, at, northampton, and, assistant, to, his, grandfather, solomon, stoddard, a, noted, minister, he, was, a, scholar, pastor, not, a, visiting, pastor, his, rule, being, 13, hours, of, study, per, day, in, the, same, year, he, married, sarah, pierpont, then, 17, sarah, was, from, a, notable, new, england, clerical, family, her, father, was, james, pierpont, 1659, 1714, a, founder, of, yale, college, and, her, mother, was, the, granddaughter, of, thomas, hooker, sarah, s, spiritual, devotion, was, without, peer, and, her, relationship, with, god, had, long, proved, an, inspiration, to, edwards, he, first, remarked, on, her, great, piety, when, she, was, 13, years, old, she, was, of, a, bright, and, cheerful, disposition, a, practical, housekeeper, a, model, wife, and, the, mother, of, his, 11, children, who, included, esther, edwards, edwards, held, to, complementarian, views, of, marriage, and, gender, roles, solomon, stoddard, died, on, february, 11, 1729, leaving, to, his, grandson, the, sole, ministerial, charge, of, one, of, the, largest, and, wealthiest, congregations, in, the, colony, its, members, were, proud, of, its, morality, its, culture, and, its, reputation, summing, up, edwards, influences, during, his, younger, years, scholar, john, e, smith, writes, by, thus, meditating, between, berkeley, on, the, one, hand, and, locke, descartes, and, hobbes, on, the, other, the, young, edwards, hoped, to, rescue, christianity, from, the, deadweight, of, rationalism, and, the, paralyzing, inertia, of, skepticism, christianity, protestantism, on, july, 8, 1731, edwards, preached, in, boston, the, public, lecture, afterwards, published, under, the, title, god, glorified, in, the, work, of, redemption, by, the, greatness, of, man, s, dependence, upon, him, in, the, whole, of, it, which, was, his, first, public, attack, on, arminianism, the, emphasis, of, the, lecture, was, on, god, s, absolute, sovereignty, in, the, work, of, salvation, that, while, it, behooved, god, to, create, man, pure, and, without, sin, it, was, of, his, good, pleasure, and, mere, and, arbitrary, grace, for, him, to, grant, any, person, the, faith, necessary, to, incline, him, or, her, toward, holiness, and, that, god, might, deny, this, grace, without, any, disparagement, to, any, of, his, character, in, 1733, a, spiritual, revival, began, in, northampton, and, reached, such, an, intensity, in, the, winter, of, 1734, and, the, following, spring, that, it, threatened, the, business, of, the, town, in, six, months, nearly, 300, of, 1, 100, youths, were, admitted, to, the, church, the, revival, gave, edwards, an, opportunity, to, study, the, process, of, conversion, in, all, its, phases, and, varieties, and, he, recorded, his, observations, with, psychological, minuteness, and, discrimination, in, a, faithful, narrative, of, the, surprising, work, of, god, in, the, conversion, of, many, hundred, souls, in, northampton, 1737, a, year, later, he, published, discourses, on, various, important, subjects, the, five, sermons, which, had, proved, most, effective, in, the, revival, of, these, none, was, so, immediately, effective, as, that, on, the, justice, of, god, in, the, damnation, of, sinners, from, the, text, that, every, mouth, may, be, stopped, another, sermon, published, in, 1734, a, divine, and, supernatural, light, immediately, imparted, to, the, soul, by, the, spirit, of, god, set, forth, what, he, regarded, as, the, inner, moving, principle, of, the, revival, the, doctrine, of, a, special, grace, in, the, immediate, and, supernatural, divine, illumination, of, the, soul, by, 1735, the, revival, had, spread, and, appeared, independently, across, the, connecticut, river, valley, and, perhaps, as, far, as, new, jersey, however, criticism, of, the, revival, began, and, many, new, englanders, feared, that, edwards, had, led, his, flock, into, fanaticism, over, the, summer, of, 1735, religious, fervor, took, a, dark, turn, many, new, englanders, were, affected, by, the, revivals, but, not, converted, and, became, convinced, of, their, inexorable, damnation, edwards, wrote, that, multitudes, felt, urged, presumably, by, satan, to, take, their, own, lives, at, least, two, people, committed, suicide, in, the, depths, of, their, spiritual, distress, one, from, edwards, s, own, congregation, his, uncle, joseph, hawley, ii, it, is, not, known, if, any, others, took, their, own, lives, but, the, suicide, craze, effectively, ended, the, first, wave, of, revival, except, in, some, parts, of, connecticut, despite, these, setbacks, and, the, cooling, of, religious, fervor, word, of, the, northampton, revival, and, edwards, s, leadership, role, had, spread, as, far, as, england, and, scotland, it, was, at, this, time, that, edwards, became, acquainted, with, george, whitefield, who, was, traveling, the, thirteen, colonies, on, a, revival, tour, in, 1739, 40, the, two, men, may, not, have, seen, eye, to, eye, on, every, detail, whitefield, was, far, more, comfortable, with, the, strongly, emotional, elements, of, revival, than, edwards, was, but, they, were, both, passionate, about, preaching, the, gospel, they, worked, together, to, orchestrate, whitefield, s, trip, first, through, boston, and, then, to, northampton, when, whitefield, preached, at, edwards, s, church, in, northampton, he, reminded, them, of, the, revival, they, had, undergone, just, a, few, years, before, this, deeply, touched, edwards, who, wept, throughout, the, entire, service, and, much, of, the, congregation, too, was, moved, revivals, began, to, spring, up, again, and, edwards, preached, his, most, famous, sermon, sinners, in, the, hands, of, an, angry, god, in, enfield, connecticut, in, 1741, though, this, sermon, has, been, widely, reprinted, as, an, example, of, fire, and, brimstone, preaching, in, the, colonial, revivals, that, characterization, is, not, in, keeping, with, descriptions, of, edward, s, actual, preaching, style, edwards, did, not, shout, or, speak, loudly, but, talked, in, a, quiet, emotive, voice, he, moved, his, audience, slowly, from, point, to, point, towards, an, inexorable, conclusion, they, were, lost, without, the, grace, of, god, while, most, 21st, century, readers, notice, the, damnation, looming, in, such, a, sermon, text, historian, george, marsden, reminds, us, that, edwards, was, not, preaching, anything, new, or, surprising, edwards, could, take, for, granted, that, a, new, england, audience, knew, well, the, gospel, remedy, the, problem, was, getting, them, to, seek, it, the, movement, met, with, opposition, from, conservative, congregationalist, ministers, in, 1741, edwards, published, in, the, defense, of, revivals, the, distinguishing, marks, of, a, work, of, the, spirit, of, god, dealing, particularly, with, the, phenomena, most, criticized, the, swoonings, outcries, and, convulsions, these, bodily, effects, he, insisted, were, not, distinguishing, marks, of, the, work, of, the, spirit, of, god, one, way, or, another, so, bitter, was, the, feeling, against, the, revival, in, some, churches, that, in, 1742, he, felt, moved, to, write, a, second, apology, thoughts, on, the, revival, in, new, england, where, his, main, argument, concerned, the, great, moral, improvement, of, the, country, in, the, same, pamphlet, he, defends, an, appeal, to, the, emotions, and, advocates, preaching, terror, when, necessary, even, to, children, who, in, god, s, sight, are, young, vipers, if, not, christ, s, he, considered, bodily, effects, incidental, to, the, real, work, of, god, but, his, own, mystic, devotion, and, the, experiences, of, his, wife, during, the, awakening, which, he, recounts, in, detail, make, him, think, that, the, divine, visitation, usually, overpowers, the, body, a, view, in, support, of, which, he, quotes, scripture, in, reply, to, edwards, charles, chauncy, wrote, seasonable, thoughts, on, the, state, of, religion, in, new, england, in, 1743, and, anonymously, penned, the, late, religious, commotions, in, new, england, considered, in, the, same, year, in, these, works, he, urged, conduct, as, the, sole, test, of, conversion, the, general, convention, of, congregational, ministers, in, the, province, of, massachusetts, bay, seemed, to, agree, protesting, against, disorders, in, practice, which, have, of, late, obtained, in, various, parts, of, the, land, in, spite, of, edwards, s, able, pamphlet, the, impression, had, become, widespread, that, bodily, effects, were, recognized, by, the, promoters, of, the, great, awakening, as, the, true, tests, of, conversion, to, offset, this, feeling, during, the, years, 1742, and, 1743, edwards, preached, at, northampton, a, series, of, sermons, published, under, the, title, of, religious, affections, 1746, a, restatement, in, a, more, philosophical, and, general, tone, of, his, ideas, as, to, distinguishing, marks, in, 1747, he, joined, the, movement, started, in, scotland, called, the, concert, in, prayer, and, in, the, same, year, published, an, humble, attempt, to, promote, explicit, agreement, and, visible, union, of, god, s, people, in, extraordinary, prayer, for, the, revival, of, religion, and, the, advancement, of, christ, s, kingdom, on, earth, in, 1749, he, published, a, memoir, of, david, brainerd, who, had, lived, with, his, family, for, several, months, and, had, died, at, northampton, in, 1747, brainerd, had, been, constantly, attended, by, edwards, s, daughter, jerusha, to, whom, he, was, rumored, to, have, been, engaged, to, be, married, though, there, is, no, surviving, evidence, of, this, in, the, course, of, elaborating, his, theories, of, conversion, edwards, used, david, brainerd, and, his, ministry, as, a, case, study, making, extensive, notes, of, his, conversions, and, confessions, in, 1748, there, had, come, a, crisis, in, his, relations, with, his, congregation, the, half, way, covenant, adopted, by, the, synods, of, 1657, and, 1662, had, made, baptism, alone, the, condition, to, the, civil, privileges, of, church, membership, but, not, of, participation, in, the, sacrament, of, the, lord, s, supper, stoddard, had, been, even, more, liberal, holding, that, the, lord, s, supper, was, a, converting, ordinance, and, that, baptism, was, a, sufficient, title, to, all, the, privileges, of, the, church, as, early, as, 1744, edwards, in, his, sermons, on, religious, affections, had, plainly, intimated, his, dislike, of, this, practice, in, the, same, year, he, had, published, in, a, church, meeting, the, names, of, certain, young, people, members, of, the, church, who, were, suspected, of, reading, improper, books, and, also, the, names, of, those, who, were, to, be, called, as, witnesses, in, the, case, it, has, often, been, reported, that, the, witnesses, and, accused, were, not, distinguished, on, this, list, and, so, the, entire, congregation, was, in, an, uproar, however, patricia, tracy, s, research, has, cast, doubt, on, this, version, of, the, events, noting, that, in, the, list, he, read, from, the, names, were, definitely, distinguished, those, involved, were, eventually, disciplined, for, disrespect, to, the, investigators, rather, than, for, the, original, incident, in, any, case, the, incident, further, deteriorated, the, relationship, between, edwards, and, the, congregation, edwards, s, preaching, became, unpopular, for, four, years, no, candidate, presented, himself, for, admission, to, the, church, and, when, one, eventually, did, in, 1748, he, was, met, with, edwards, s, formal, tests, as, expressed, in, the, distinguishing, marks, and, later, in, qualifications, for, full, communion, 1749, the, candidate, refused, to, submit, to, them, the, church, backed, him, and, the, break, between, the, church, and, edwards, was, complete, even, permission, to, discuss, his, views, in, the, pulpit, was, refused, he, was, allowed, to, present, his, views, on, thursday, afternoons, his, sermons, were, well, attended, by, his, fans, but, not, his, own, congregation, a, council, was, convened, to, decide, the, communion, matter, between, the, minister, and, his, people, the, congregation, chose, half, the, council, and, edwards, was, allowed, to, select, the, other, half, of, the, council, his, congregation, however, limited, his, selection, to, one, county, where, the, majority, of, the, ministers, were, against, him, the, ecclesiastical, council, voted, by, 10, to, 9, that, the, pastoral, relation, be, dissolved, the, church, members, by, a, vote, of, more, than, 200, to, 23, ratified, the, action, of, the, council, and, finally, a, town, meeting, voted, that, edwards, should, not, be, allowed, to, occupy, the, northampton, pulpit, though, he, continued, to, live, in, the, town, and, preach, in, the, church, by, the, request, of, the, congregation, until, october, 1751, in, his, farewell, sermon, he, preached, from, 2, corinthians, 1, 14, and, directed, the, thoughts, of, his, people, to, that, far, future, when, the, minister, and, his, people, would, stand, before, god, in, a, letter, to, scotland, after, his, dismissal, he, expresses, his, preference, for, presbyterian, to, congregational, polity, his, position, at, the, time, was, not, unpopular, throughout, new, england, his, doctrine, that, the, lord, s, supper, is, not, a, cause, of, regeneration, and, that, communicants, should, be, professing, protestants, has, since, largely, through, the, efforts, of, his, pupil, joseph, bellamy, become, a, standard, of, new, england, congregationalism, edwards, was, in, high, demand, a, parish, in, scotland, could, have, been, procured, for, him, and, he, was, called, to, a, virginia, church, he, declined, both, to, become, pastor, in, 1751, of, the, church, in, stockbridge, massachusetts, and, a, missionary, to, the, housatonic, indians, taking, over, for, the, recently, deceased, john, sergeant, to, the, indians, he, preached, through, an, interpreter, and, their, interests, he, boldly, and, successfully, defended, by, attacking, the, whites, who, were, using, their, official, positions, among, them, to, increase, their, private, fortunes, during, this, time, he, got, to, know, judge, joseph, dwight, who, was, trustee, of, the, indian, schools, in, stockbridge, he, wrote, the, humble, relation, also, called, reply, to, williams, 1752, which, was, an, answer, to, solomon, williams, a, relative, and, a, bitter, opponent, of, edwards, as, to, the, qualifications, for, full, communion, he, composed, the, treatises, on, which, his, reputation, as, a, philosophical, theologian, chiefly, rests, the, essay, on, original, sin, the, dissertation, concerning, the, nature, of, true, virtue, the, dissertation, concerning, the, end, for, which, god, created, the, world, and, the, great, work, on, the, will, written, in, four, and, a, half, months, and, published, in, 1754, under, the, title, an, inquiry, into, the, modern, prevailing, notions, respecting, that, freedom, of, the, will, which, is, supposed, to, be, essential, to, moral, agency, aaron, burr, sr, edwards, son, in, law, died, in, 1757, he, had, married, esther, edwards, five,
