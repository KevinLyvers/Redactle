ren, descartes, d, e, k, r, t, day, kart, or, uk, d, e, k, r, t, day, kart, french, 31, march, 1596, 11, february, 1650, 58, was, a, french, philosopher, scientist, and, mathematician, widely, considered, a, seminal, figure, in, the, emergence, of, modern, philosophy, and, science, mathematics, was, paramount, to, his, method, of, inquiry, and, he, connected, the, previously, separate, fields, of, geometry, and, algebra, into, analytic, geometry, descartes, spent, much, of, his, working, life, in, the, dutch, republic, initially, serving, the, dutch, states, army, and, later, becoming, a, central, intellectual, of, the, dutch, golden, age, although, he, served, a, protestant, state, and, was, later, counted, as, a, deist, by, critics, descartes, was, roman, catholic, many, elements, of, descartes, philosophy, have, precedents, in, late, aristotelianism, the, revived, stoicism, of, the, 16th, century, or, in, earlier, philosophers, like, augustine, in, his, natural, philosophy, he, differed, from, the, schools, on, two, major, points, first, he, rejected, the, splitting, of, corporeal, substance, into, matter, and, form, second, he, rejected, any, appeal, to, final, ends, divine, or, natural, in, explaining, natural, phenomena, in, his, theology, he, insists, on, the, absolute, freedom, of, god, s, act, of, creation, refusing, to, accept, the, authority, of, previous, philosophers, descartes, frequently, set, his, views, apart, from, the, philosophers, who, preceded, him, in, the, opening, section, of, the, passions, of, the, soul, an, early, modern, treatise, on, emotions, descartes, goes, so, far, as, to, assert, that, he, will, write, on, this, topic, as, if, no, one, had, written, on, these, matters, before, his, best, known, philosophical, statement, is, cogito, ergo, sum, i, think, therefore, i, am, french, je, pense, donc, je, suis, found, in, discourse, on, the, method, 1637, in, french, and, latin, 1644, and, principles, of, philosophy, 1644, in, latin, 1647, in, french, the, statement, has, either, been, interpreted, as, a, logical, syllogism, or, as, an, intuitive, thought, descartes, has, often, been, called, the, father, of, modern, philosophy, and, is, largely, seen, as, responsible, for, the, increased, attention, given, to, epistemology, in, the, 17th, century, he, laid, the, foundation, for, 17th, century, continental, rationalism, later, advocated, by, spinoza, and, leibniz, and, was, later, opposed, by, the, empiricist, school, of, thought, consisting, of, hobbes, locke, berkeley, and, hume, the, rise, of, early, modern, rationalism, as, a, systematic, school, of, philosophy, in, its, own, right, for, the, first, time, in, history, exerted, an, influence, on, modern, western, thought, in, general, with, the, birth, of, two, rationalistic, philosophical, systems, of, descartes, cartesianism, and, spinoza, spinozism, it, was, the, 17th, century, arch, rationalists, like, descartes, spinoza, and, leibniz, who, have, given, the, age, of, reason, its, name, and, place, in, history, leibniz, spinoza, and, descartes, were, all, well, versed, in, mathematics, as, well, as, philosophy, with, descartes, and, leibniz, additionally, contributing, to, a, variety, of, scientific, disciplines, descartes, meditations, on, first, philosophy, 1641, continues, to, be, a, standard, text, at, most, university, philosophy, departments, descartes, influence, in, mathematics, is, equally, apparent, being, the, namesake, of, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, he, is, credited, as, the, father, of, analytic, geometry, used, in, the, discovery, of, infinitesimal, calculus, and, analysis, descartes, was, also, one, of, the, key, figures, in, the, scientific, revolution, ren, descartes, was, born, in, la, haye, en, touraine, province, of, touraine, now, descartes, indre, et, loire, france, on, 31, march, 1596, in, may, 1597, his, mother, jeanne, brochard, died, a, few, days, after, giving, birth, to, a, still, born, child, descartes, father, joachim, was, a, member, of, the, parlement, of, rennes, at, rennes, 22, ren, lived, with, his, grandmother, and, with, his, great, uncle, although, the, descartes, family, was, roman, catholic, the, poitou, region, was, controlled, by, the, protestant, huguenots, in, 1607, late, because, of, his, fragile, health, he, entered, the, jesuit, coll, ge, royal, henry, le, grand, at, la, fl, che, where, he, was, introduced, to, mathematics, and, physics, including, galileo, s, work, while, there, descartes, first, encountered, hermetic, mysticism, after, graduation, in, 1614, he, studied, for, two, years, 1615, 16, at, the, university, of, poitiers, earning, a, baccalaur, at, and, licence, in, canon, and, civil, law, in, 1616, in, accordance, with, his, father, s, wishes, that, he, should, become, a, lawyer, from, there, he, moved, to, paris, in, discourse, on, the, method, descartes, recalls, 20, 21, i, entirely, abandoned, the, study, of, letters, resolving, to, seek, no, knowledge, other, than, that, of, which, could, be, found, in, myself, or, else, in, the, great, book, of, the, world, i, spent, the, rest, of, my, youth, traveling, visiting, courts, and, armies, mixing, with, people, of, diverse, temperaments, and, ranks, gathering, various, experiences, testing, myself, in, the, situations, which, fortune, offered, me, and, at, all, times, reflecting, upon, whatever, came, my, way, to, derive, some, profit, from, it, in, accordance, with, his, ambition, to, become, a, professional, military, officer, in, 1618, descartes, joined, as, a, mercenary, the, protestant, dutch, states, army, in, breda, under, the, command, of, maurice, of, nassau, and, undertook, a, formal, study, of, military, engineering, as, established, by, simon, stevin, descartes, therefore, received, much, encouragement, in, breda, to, advance, his, knowledge, of, mathematics, in, this, way, he, became, acquainted, with, isaac, beeckman, the, principal, of, a, dordrecht, school, for, whom, he, wrote, the, compendium, of, music, written, 1618, published, 1650, while, in, the, service, of, the, catholic, duke, maximilian, of, bavaria, from, 1619, descartes, was, present, at, the, battle, of, the, white, mountain, near, prague, in, november, 1620, according, to, adrien, baillet, on, the, night, of, 10, 11, november, 1619, st, martin, s, day, while, stationed, in, neuburg, an, der, donau, descartes, shut, himself, in, a, room, with, an, oven, probably, a, cocklestove, to, escape, the, cold, while, within, he, had, three, dreams, and, believed, that, a, divine, spirit, revealed, to, him, a, new, philosophy, however, it, is, speculated, that, what, descartes, considered, to, be, his, second, dream, was, actually, an, episode, of, exploding, head, syndrome, upon, exiting, he, had, formulated, analytic, geometry, and, the, idea, of, applying, the, mathematical, method, to, philosophy, he, concluded, from, these, visions, that, the, pursuit, of, science, would, prove, to, be, for, him, the, pursuit, of, true, wisdom, and, a, central, part, of, his, life, s, work, descartes, also, saw, very, clearly, that, all, truths, were, linked, with, one, another, so, that, finding, a, fundamental, truth, and, proceeding, with, logic, would, open, the, way, to, all, science, descartes, discovered, this, basic, truth, quite, soon, his, famous, i, think, therefore, i, am, in, 1620, descartes, left, the, army, he, visited, basilica, della, santa, casa, in, loreto, then, visited, various, countries, before, returning, to, france, and, during, the, next, few, years, he, spent, time, in, paris, it, was, there, that, he, composed, his, first, essay, on, method, regulae, ad, directionem, ingenii, rules, for, the, direction, of, the, mind, he, arrived, in, la, haye, in, 1623, selling, all, of, his, property, to, invest, in, bonds, which, provided, a, comfortable, income, for, the, rest, of, his, life, 94, descartes, was, present, at, the, siege, of, la, rochelle, by, cardinal, richelieu, in, 1627, as, an, observer, 128, there, he, was, interested, in, the, physical, properties, of, the, great, dike, that, richelieu, was, building, and, studied, mathematically, everything, he, saw, during, the, siege, he, also, met, french, mathematician, girard, desargues, in, the, autumn, of, that, year, in, the, residence, of, the, papal, nuncio, guidi, di, bagno, where, he, came, with, mersenne, and, many, other, scholars, to, listen, to, a, lecture, given, by, the, alchemist, nicolas, de, villiers, sieur, de, chandoux, on, the, principles, of, a, supposed, new, philosophy, cardinal, b, rulle, urged, him, to, write, an, exposition, of, his, new, philosophy, in, some, location, beyond, the, reach, of, the, inquisition, descartes, returned, to, the, dutch, republic, in, 1628, in, april, 1629, he, joined, the, university, of, franeker, studying, under, adriaan, metius, either, living, with, a, catholic, family, or, renting, the, sjaerdemaslot, the, next, year, under, the, name, poitevin, he, enrolled, at, leiden, university, which, at, the, time, was, a, protestant, university, he, studied, both, mathematics, with, jacobus, golius, who, confronted, him, with, pappus, s, hexagon, theorem, and, astronomy, with, martin, hortensius, in, october, 1630, he, had, a, falling, out, with, beeckman, whom, he, accused, of, plagiarizing, some, of, his, ideas, in, amsterdam, he, had, a, relationship, with, a, servant, girl, helena, jans, van, der, strom, with, whom, he, had, a, daughter, francine, who, was, born, in, 1635, in, deventer, she, was, baptized, a, protestant, and, died, of, scarlet, fever, at, the, age, of, 5, unlike, many, moralists, of, the, time, descartes, did, not, deprecate, the, passions, but, rather, defended, them, he, wept, upon, francine, s, death, in, 1640, according, to, a, recent, biography, by, jason, porterfield, descartes, said, that, he, did, not, believe, that, one, must, refrain, from, tears, to, prove, oneself, a, man, russell, shorto, speculates, that, the, experience, of, fatherhood, and, losing, a, child, formed, a, turning, point, in, descartes, work, changing, its, focus, from, medicine, to, a, quest, for, universal, answers, despite, frequent, moves, he, wrote, all, of, his, major, work, during, his, 20, plus, years, in, the, netherlands, initiating, a, revolution, in, mathematics, and, philosophy, in, 1633, galileo, was, condemned, by, the, italian, inquisition, and, descartes, abandoned, plans, to, publish, treatise, on, the, world, his, work, of, the, previous, four, years, nevertheless, in, 1637, he, published, parts, of, this, work, in, three, essays, les, m, t, ores, the, meteors, la, dioptrique, dioptrics, and, la, g, om, trie, geometry, preceded, by, an, introduction, his, famous, discours, de, la, m, thode, discourse, on, the, method, in, it, descartes, lays, out, four, rules, of, thought, meant, to, ensure, that, our, knowledge, rests, upon, a, firm, foundation, the, first, was, never, to, accept, anything, for, true, which, i, did, not, know, to, be, such, that, is, to, say, carefully, to, avoid, precipitancy, and, prejudice, and, to, comprise, nothing, more, in, my, judgment, than, what, was, presented, to, my, mind, so, clearly, and, distinctly, as, to, exclude, all, ground, of, doubt, in, la, g, om, trie, descartes, exploited, the, discoveries, he, made, with, pierre, de, fermat, this, later, became, known, as, cartesian, geometry, descartes, continued, to, publish, works, concerning, both, mathematics, and, philosophy, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1641, he, published, a, metaphysics, treatise, meditationes, de, prima, philosophia, meditations, on, first, philosophy, written, in, latin, and, thus, addressed, to, the, learned, it, was, followed, in, 1644, by, principia, philosophiae, principles, of, philosophy, a, kind, of, synthesis, of, the, discourse, on, the, method, and, meditations, on, first, philosophy, in, 1643, cartesian, philosophy, was, condemned, at, the, university, of, utrecht, and, descartes, was, obliged, to, flee, to, the, hague, settling, in, egmond, binnen, between, 1643, and, 1649, descartes, lived, with, his, girlfriend, at, egmond, binnen, in, an, inn, descartes, became, friendly, with, anthony, studler, van, zurck, lord, of, bergen, and, participated, in, the, design, of, his, mansion, and, estate, he, also, met, dirck, rembrantsz, van, nierop, a, mathematician, and, surveyor, he, was, so, impressed, by, van, nierop, s, knowledge, that, he, even, brought, him, to, the, attention, of, constantijn, huygens, and, frans, van, schooten, christia, mercer, suggested, that, descartes, may, have, been, influenced, by, spanish, author, and, roman, catholic, nun, teresa, of, vila, who, fifty, years, earlier, published, the, interior, castle, concerning, the, role, of, philosophical, reflection, in, intellectual, growth, descartes, began, through, alfonso, polloti, an, italian, general, in, dutch, service, a, six, year, correspondence, with, princess, elisabeth, of, bohemia, devoted, mainly, to, moral, and, psychological, subjects, connected, with, this, correspondence, in, 1649, he, published, les, passions, de, l, me, the, passions, of, the, soul, which, he, dedicated, to, the, princess, a, french, translation, of, principia, philosophiae, prepared, by, abbot, claude, picot, was, published, in, 1647, this, edition, was, also, dedicated, to, princess, elisabeth, in, the, preface, to, the, french, edition, descartes, praised, true, philosophy, as, a, means, to, attain, wisdom, he, identifies, four, ordinary, sources, to, reach, wisdom, and, finally, says, that, there, is, a, fifth, better, and, more, secure, consisting, in, the, search, for, first, causes, by, 1649, descartes, had, become, one, of, europe, s, most, famous, philosophers, and, scientists, that, year, queen, christina, of, sweden, invited, him, to, her, court, to, organize, a, new, scientific, academy, and, tutor, her, in, his, ideas, about, love, descartes, accepted, and, moved, to, the, swedish, empire, in, the, middle, of, winter, christina, was, interested, in, and, stimulated, descartes, to, publish, the, passions, of, the, soul, he, was, a, guest, at, the, house, of, pierre, chanut, living, on, v, sterl, nggatan, less, than, 500, meters, from, castle, tre, kronor, in, stockholm, there, chanut, and, descartes, made, observations, with, a, torricellian, mercury, barometer, challenging, blaise, pascal, descartes, took, the, first, set, of, barometric, readings, in, stockholm, to, see, if, atmospheric, pressure, could, be, used, in, forecasting, the, weather, descartes, arranged, to, give, lessons, to, queen, christina, after, her, birthday, three, times, a, week, at, 5, am, in, her, cold, and, draughty, castle, however, by, 15, january, 1650, the, queen, had, actually, met, with, descartes, only, four, or, five, times, it, soon, became, clear, they, did, not, like, each, other, she, did, not, care, for, his, mechanical, philosophy, nor, did, he, share, her, interest, in, ancient, greek, language, and, literature, on, 1, february, 1650, he, contracted, pneumonia, and, died, on, 11, february, at, chanut, yesterday, morning, about, four, o, clock, a, m, has, deceased, here, at, the, house, of, his, excellency, mr, chanut, french, ambassador, mr, descartes, as, i, have, been, informed, he, had, been, ill, for, a, few, days, with, pleurisy, but, as, he, did, not, want, to, take, or, use, medicines, a, hot, fever, appears, to, have, arisen, as, well, thereupon, he, had, himself, bled, three, times, in, one, day, but, without, operation, of, losing, much, blood, her, majesty, much, bemoaned, his, decease, because, he, was, such, a, learned, man, he, has, been, cast, in, wax, it, was, not, his, intention, to, die, here, as, he, had, resolved, shortly, before, his, death, to, return, to, holland, at, the, first, occasion, etc, the, cause, of, death, was, pneumonia, according, to, chanut, but, peripneumonia, according, to, christina, s, physician, johann, van, wullen, who, was, not, allowed, to, bleed, him, the, winter, seems, to, have, been, mild, except, for, the, second, half, of, january, which, was, harsh, as, described, by, descartes, himself, however, this, remark, was, probably, intended, to, be, as, much, descartes, take, on, the, intellectual, climate, as, it, was, about, the, weather, e, pies, has, questioned, this, account, based, on, a, letter, by, the, doctor, van, wullen, however, descartes, had, refused, his, treatment, and, more, arguments, against, its, veracity, have, been, raised, since, in, a, 2009, book, german, philosopher, theodor, ebert, argues, that, descartes, was, poisoned, by, jacques, viogu, a, catholic, missionary, who, opposed, his, religious, views, as, evidence, ebert, suggests, that, catherine, descartes, the, niece, of, ren, descartes, made, a, veiled, reference, to, the, act, of, poisoning, when, her, uncle, was, administered, communion, two, days, before, his, death, in, her, report, on, the, death, of, m, descartes, the, philosopher, 1693, as, a, catholic, in, a, protestant, nation, he, was, interred, in, the, churchyard, of, what, was, to, become, adolf, fredrik, church, in, stockholm, where, mainly, orphans, had, been, buried, his, manuscripts, came, into, the, possession, of, claude, clerselier, chanut, s, brother, in, law, and, a, devout, catholic, who, has, begun, the, process, of, turning, descartes, into, a, saint, by, cutting, adding, and, publishing, his, letters, selectively, 137, 154, in, 1663, the, pope, placed, descartes, works, on, the, index, of, prohibited, books, in, 1666, sixteen, years, after, his, death, his, remains, were, taken, to, france, and, buried, in, saint, tienne, du, mont, in, 1671, louis, xiv, prohibited, all, lectures, in, cartesianism, although, the, national, convention, in, 1792, had, planned, to, transfer, his, remains, to, the, panth, on, he, was, reburied, in, the, abbey, of, saint, germain, des, pr, s, in, 1819, missing, a, finger, and, the, skull, his, skull, is, in, the, mus, e, de, l, homme, in, paris, in, his, discourse, on, the, method, he, attempts, to, arrive, at, a, fundamental, set, of, principles, that, one, can, know, as, true, without, any, doubt, to, achieve, this, he, employs, a, method, called, hyperbolical, metaphysical, doubt, also, sometimes, referred, to, as, methodological, skepticism, or, cartesian, doubt, he, rejects, any, ideas, that, can, be, doubted, and, then, re, establishes, them, in, order, to, acquire, a, firm, foundation, for, genuine, knowledge, descartes, built, his, ideas, from, scratch, which, he, does, in, the, meditations, on, first, philosophy, he, relates, this, to, architecture, the, top, soil, is, taken, away, to, create, a, new, building, or, structure, descartes, calls, his, doubt, the, soil, and, new, knowledge, the, buildings, to, descartes, aristotle, s, foundationalism, is, incomplete, and, his, method, of, doubt, enhances, foundationalism, initially, descartes, arrives, at, only, a, single, first, principle, he, thinks, this, is, expressed, in, the, latin, phrase, in, the, discourse, on, method, cogito, ergo, sum, english, i, think, therefore, i, am, descartes, concluded, if, he, doubted, then, something, or, someone, must, be, doing, the, doubting, therefore, the, very, fact, that, he, doubted, proved, his, existence, the, simple, meaning, of, the, phrase, is, that, if, one, is, skeptical, of, existence, that, is, in, and, of, itself, proof, that, he, does, exist, these, two, first, principles, i, think, and, i, exist, were, later, confirmed, by, descartes, clear, and, distinct, perception, delineated, in, his, third, meditation, from, the, meditations, as, he, clearly, and, distinctly, perceives, these, two, principles, descartes, reasoned, ensures, their, indubitability, descartes, concludes, that, he, can, be, certain, that, he, exists, because, he, thinks, but, in, what, form, he, perceives, his, body, through, the, use, of, the, senses, however, these, have, previously, been, unreliable, so, descartes, determines, that, the, only, indubitable, knowledge, is, that, he, is, a, thinking, thing, thinking, is, what, he, does, and, his, power, must, come, from, his, essence, descartes, defines, thought, cogitatio, as, what, happens, in, me, such, that, i, am, immediately, conscious, of, it, insofar, as, i, am, conscious, of, it, thinking, is, thus, every, activity, of, a, person, of, which, the, person, is, immediately, conscious, he, gave, reasons, for, thinking, that, waking, thoughts, are, distinguishable, from, dreams, and, that, one, s, mind, cannot, have, been, hijacked, by, an, evil, demon, placing, an, illusory, external, world, before, one, s, senses, and, so, something, that, i, thought, i, was, seeing, with, my, eyes, is, grasped, solely, by, the, faculty, of, judgment, which, is, in, my, mind, 109, in, this, manner, descartes, proceeds, to, construct, a, system, of, knowledge, discarding, perception, as, unreliable, and, instead, admitting, only, deduction, as, a, method, descartes, influenced, by, the, automatons, on, display, at, the, ch, teau, de, saint, germain, en, laye, near, paris, investigated, the, connection, between, mind, and, body, and, how, they, interact, his, main, influences, for, dualism, were, theology, and, physics, the, theory, on, the, dualism, of, mind, and, body, is, descartes, signature, doctrine, and, permeates, other, theories, he, advanced, known, as, cartesian, dualism, or, mind, body, dualism, his, theory, on, the, separation, between, the, mind, and, the, body, went, on, to, influence, subsequent, western, philosophies, in, meditations, on, first, philosophy, descartes, attempted, to, demonstrate, the, existence, of, god, and, the, distinction, between, the, human, soul, and, the, body, humans, are, a, union, of, mind, and, body, thus, descartes, dualism, embraced, the, idea, that, mind, and, body, are, distinct, but, closely, joined, while, many, contemporary, readers, of, descartes, found, the, distinction, between, mind, and, body, difficult, to, grasp, he, thought, it, was, entirely, straightforward, descartes, employed, the, concept, of, modes, which, are, the, ways, in, which, substances, exist, in, principles, of, philosophy, descartes, explained, we, can, clearly, perceive, a, substance, apart, from, the, mode, which, we, say, differs, from, it, whereas, we, cannot, conversely, understand, the, mode, apart, from, the, substance, to, perceive, a, mode, apart, from, its, substance, requires, an, intellectual, abstraction, which, descartes, explained, as, follows, the, intellectual, abstraction, consists, in, my, turning, my, thought, away, from, one, part, of, the, contents, of, this, richer, idea, the, better, to, apply, it, to, the, other, part, with, greater, attention, thus, when, i, consider, a, shape, without, thinking, of, the, substance, or, the, extension, whose, shape, it, is, i, make, a, mental, abstraction, according, to, descartes, two, substances, are, really, distinct, when, each, of, them, can, exist, apart, from, the, other, thus, descartes, reasoned, that, god, is, distinct, from, humans, and, the, body, and, mind, of, a, human, are, also, distinct, from, one, another, he, argued, that, the, great, differences, between, body, an, extended, thing, and, mind, an, un, extended, immaterial, thing, make, the, two, ontologically, distinct, according, to, descartes, indivisibility, argument, the, mind, is, utterly, indivisible, because, when, i, consider, the, mind, or, myself, in, so, far, as, i, am, merely, a, thinking, thing, i, am, unable, to, distinguish, any, part, within, myself, i, understand, myself, to, be, something, quite, single, and, complete, moreover, in, the, meditations, descartes, discusses, a, piece, of, wax, and, exposes, the, single, most, characteristic, doctrine, of, cartesian, dualism, that, the, universe, contained, two, radically, different, kinds, of, substances, the, mind, or, soul, defined, as, thinking, and, the, body, defined, as, matter, and, unthinking, the, aristotelian, philosophy, of, descartes, days, held, that, the, universe, was, inherently, purposeful, or, teleological, everything, that, happened, be, it, the, motion, of, the, stars, or, the, growth, of, a, tree, was, supposedly, explainable, by, a, certain, purpose, goal, or, end, that, worked, its, way, out, within, nature, aristotle, called, this, the, final, cause, and, these, final, causes, were, indispensable, for, explaining, the, ways, nature, operated, descartes, theory, of, dualism, supports, the, distinction, between, traditional, aristotelian, science, and, the, new, science, of, kepler, and, galileo, which, denied, the, role, of, a, divine, power, and, final, causes, in, its, attempts, to, explain, nature, descartes, dualism, provided, the, philosophical, rationale, for, the, latter, by, expelling, the, final, cause, from, the, physical, universe, or, res, extensa, in, favor, of, the, mind, or, res, cogitans, therefore, while, cartesian, dualism, paved, the, way, for, modern, physics, it, also, held, the, door, open, for, religious, beliefs, about, the, immortality, of, the, soul, descartes, dualism, of, mind, and, matter, implied, a, concept, of, human, beings, a, human, was, according, to, descartes, a, composite, entity, of, mind, and, body, descartes, gave, priority, to, the, mind, and, argued, that, the, mind, could, exist, without, the, body, but, the, body, could, not, exist, without, the, mind, in, the, meditations, descartes, even, argues, that, while, the, mind, is, a, substance, the, body, is, composed, only, of, accidents, but, he, did, argue, that, mind, and, body, are, closely, joined, nature, also, teaches, me, by, the, sensations, of, pain, hunger, thirst, and, so, on, that, i, am, not, merely, present, in, my, body, as, a, pilot, in, his, ship, but, that, i, am, very, closely, joined, and, as, it, were, intermingled, with, it, so, that, i, and, the, body, form, a, unit, if, this, were, not, so, i, who, am, nothing, but, a, thinking, thing, would, not, feel, pain, when, the, body, was, hurt, but, would, perceive, the, damage, purely, by, the, intellect, just, as, a, sailor, perceives, by, sight, if, anything, in, his, ship, is, broken, descartes, discussion, on, embodiment, raised, one, of, the, most, perplexing, problems, of, his, dualism, philosophy, what, exactly, is, the, relationship, of, union, between, the, mind, and, the, body, of, a, person, therefore, cartesian, dualism, set, the, agenda, for, philosophical, discussion, of, the, mind, body, problem, for, many, years, after, descartes, death, descartes, was, also, a, rationalist, and, believed, in, the, power, of, innate, ideas, descartes, argued, the, theory, of, innate, knowledge, and, that, all, humans, were, born, with, knowledge, through, the, higher, power, of, god, it, was, this, theory, of, innate, knowledge, that, was, later, combated, by, philosopher, john, locke, 1632, 1704, an, empiricist, empiricism, holds, that, all, knowledge, is, acquired, through, experience, in, the, passions, of, the, soul, published, in, 1649, descartes, discussed, the, common, contemporary, belief, that, the, human, body, contained, animal, spirits, these, animal, spirits, were, believed, to, be, light, and, roaming, fluids, circulating, rapidly, around, the, nervous, system, between, the, brain, and, the, muscles, these, animal, spirits, were, believed, to, affect, the, human, soul, or, passions, of, the, soul, descartes, distinguished, six, basic, passions, wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy, and, sadness, all, of, these, passions, he, argued, represented, different, combinations, of, the, original, spirit, and, influenced, the, soul, to, will, or, want, certain, actions, he, argued, for, example, that, fear, is, a, passion, that, moves, the, soul, to, generate, a, response, in, the, body, in, line, with, his, dualist, teachings, on, the, separation, between, the, soul, and, the, body, he, hypothesized, that, some, part, of, the, brain, served, as, a, connector, between, the, soul, and, the, body, and, singled, out, the, pineal, gland, as, connector, descartes, argued, that, signals, passed, from, the, ear, and, the, eye, to, the, pineal, gland, through, animal, spirits, thus, different, motions, in, the, gland, cause, various, animal, spirits, he, argued, that, these, motions, in, the, pineal, gland, are, based, on, god, s, will, and, that, humans, are, supposed, to, want, and, like, things, that, are, useful, to, them, but, he, also, argued, that, the, animal, spirits, that, moved, around, the, body, could, distort, the, commands, from, the, pineal, gland, thus, humans, had, to, learn, how, to, control, their, passions, descartes, advanced, a, theory, on, automatic, bodily, reactions, to, external, events, which, influenced, 19th, century, reflex, theory, he, argued, that, external, motions, such, as, touch, and, sound, reach, the, endings, of, the, nerves, and, affect, the, animal, spirits, for, example, heat, from, fire, affects, a, spot, on, the, skin, and, sets, in, motion, a, chain, of, reactions, with, the, animal, spirits, reaching, the, brain, through, the, central, nervous, system, and, in, turn, animal, spirits, are, sent, back, to, the, muscles, to, move, the, hand, away, from, the, fire, through, this, chain, of, reactions, the, automatic, reactions, of, the, body, do, not, require, a, thought, process, above, all, he, was, among, the, first, scientists, who, believed, that, the, soul, should, be, subject, to, scientific, investigation, he, challenged, the, views, of, his, contemporaries, that, the, soul, was, divine, thus, religious, authorities, regarded, his, books, as, dangerous, descartes, writings, went, on, to, form, the, basis, for, theories, on, emotions, and, how, cognitive, evaluations, were, translated, into, affective, processes, descartes, believed, the, brain, resembled, a, working, machine, and, that, mathematics, and, mechanics, could, explain, complicated, processes, in, it, in, the, 20th, century, alan, turing, advanced, computer, science, based, on, mathematical, biology, as, inspired, by, descartes, his, theories, on, reflexes, also, served, as, the, foundation, for, advanced, physiological, theories, more, than, 200, years, after, his, death, the, physiologist, ivan, pavlov, was, a, great, admirer, of, descartes, descartes, denied, that, animals, had, reason, or, intelligence, he, argued, that, animals, did, not, lack, sensations, or, perceptions, but, these, could, be, explained, mechanistically, whereas, humans, had, a, soul, or, mind, and, were, able, to, feel, pain, and, anxiety, animals, by, virtue, of, not, having, a, soul, could, not, feel, pain, or, anxiety, if, animals, showed, signs, of, distress, then, this, was, to, protect, the, body, from, damage, but, the, innate, state, needed, for, them, to, suffer, was, absent, although, descartes, s, views, were, not, universally, accepted, they, became, prominent, in, europe, and, north, america, allowing, humans, to, treat, animals, with, impunity, the, view, that, animals, were, quite, separate, from, humanity, and, merely, machines, allowed, for, the, maltreatment, of, animals, and, was, sanctioned, in, law, and, societal, norms, until, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, 180, 214, the, publications, of, charles, darwin, would, eventually, erode, the, cartesian, view, of, animals, 37, darwin, argued, that, the, continuity, between, humans, and, other, species, suggested, the, possibility, of, animal, suffering, 177, for, descartes, ethics, was, a, science, the, highest, and, most, perfect, of, them, like, the, rest, of, the, sciences, ethics, had, its, roots, in, metaphysics, in, this, way, he, argues, for, the, existence, of, god, investigates, the, place, of, man, in, nature, formulates, the, theory, of, mind, body, dualism, and, defends, free, will, however, as, he, was, a, convinced, rationalist, descartes, clearly, states, that, reason, is, sufficient, in, the, search, for, the, goods, that, individuals, should, seek, and, virtue, consists, in, the, correct, reasoning, that, should, guide, their, actions, nevertheless, the, quality, of, this, reasoning, depends, on, knowledge, and, mental, condition, for, this, reason, he, said, that, a, complete, moral, philosophy, should, include, the, study, of, the, body, 189, he, discussed, this, subject, in, the, correspondence, with, princess, elisabeth, of, bohemia, and, as, a, result, wrote, his, work, the, passions, of, the, soul, that, contains, a, study, of, the, psychosomatic, processes, and, reactions, in, man, with, an, emphasis, on, emotions, or, passions, his, works, about, human, passion, and, emotion, would, be, the, basis, for, the, philosophy, of, his, followers, see, cartesianism, and, would, have, a, lasting, impact, on, ideas, concerning, what, literature, and, art, should, be, specifically, how, it, should, invoke, emotion, descartes, and, zeno, both, identified, sovereign, goods, with, virtue, for, epicurus, the, sovereign, good, was, pleasure, and, descartes, says, that, in, fact, this, is, not, in, contradiction, with, zeno, s, teaching, because, virtue, produces, a, spiritual, pleasure, that, is, better, than, bodily, pleasure, regarding, aristotle, s, opinion, that, happiness, eudaimonia, depends, on, both, moral, virtue, and, also, on, the, goods, of, fortune, such, as, a, moderate, degree, of, wealth, descartes, does, not, deny, that, fortunes, contributes, to, happiness, but, remarks, that, they, are, in, great, proportion, outside, one, s, own, control, whereas, one, s, mind, is, under, one, s, complete, control, the, moral, writings, of, descartes, came, at, the, last, part, of, his, life, but, earlier, in, his, discourse, on, the, method, he, adopted, three, maxims, to, be, able, to, act, while, he, put, all, his, ideas, into, doubt, those, maxims, are, known, as, his, provisional, morals, in, the, third, and, fifth, meditation, descartes, offers, proofs, of, a, benevolent, god, the, trademark, argument, and, the, ontological, argument, respectively, descartes, has, faith, in, the, account, of, reality, his, senses, provide, him, since, he, believed, that, god, provided, him, with, a, working, mind, and, sensory, system, and, does, not, desire, to, deceive, him, from, this, supposition, however, descartes, finally, establishes, the, possibility, of, acquiring, knowledge, about, the, world, based, on, deduction, and, perception, regarding, epistemology, therefore, descartes, can, be, said, to, have, contributed, such, ideas, as, a, conception, of, foundationalism, and, the, possibility, that, reason, is, the, only, reliable, method, of, attaining, knowledge, descartes, however, was, very, much, aware, that, experimentation, was, necessary, to, verify, and, validate, theories, descartes, invokes, his, causal, adequacy, principle, to, support, his, trademark, argument, for, the, existence, of, god, quoting, lucretius, in, defence, ex, nihilo, nihil, fit, meaning, nothing, comes, from, nothing, lucretius, oxford, reference, summarises, the, argument, as, follows, that, our, idea, of, perfection, is, related, to, its, perfect, origin, god, just, as, a, stamp, or, trademark, is, left, in, an, article, of, workmanship, by, its, maker, in, the, fifth, meditation, descartes, presents, a, version, of, the, ontological, argument, which, is, founded, on, the, possibility, of, thinking, the, idea, of, a, being, that, is, supremely, perfect, and, infinite, and, suggests, that, of, all, the, ideas, that, are, in, me, the, idea, that, i, have, of, god, is, the, most, true, the, most, clear, and, distinct, descartes, considered, himself, to, be, a, devout, catholic, and, one, of, the, purposes, of, the, meditations, was, to, defend, the, catholic, faith, his, attempt, to, ground, theological, beliefs, on, reason, encountered, intense, opposition, in, his, time, pascal, regarded, descartes, views, as, a, rationalist, and, mechanist, and, accused, him, of, deism, i, cannot, forgive, descartes, in, all, his, philosophy, descartes, did, his, best, to, dispense, with, god, but, descartes, could, not, avoid, prodding, god, to, set, the, world, in, motion, with, a, snap, of, his, lordly, fingers, after, that, he, had, no, more, use, for, god, while, a, powerful, contemporary, martin, schoock, accused, him, of, atheist, beliefs, though, descartes, had, provided, an, explicit, critique, of, atheism, in, his, meditations, the, catholic, church, prohibited, his, books, in, 1663, 274, descartes, also, wrote, a, response, to, external, world, skepticism, through, this, method, of, skepticism, he, does, not, doubt, for, the, sake, of, doubting, but, to, achieve, concrete, and, reliable, information, in, other, words, certainty, he, argues, that, sensory, perceptions, come, to, him, involuntarily, and, are, not, willed, by, him, they, are, external, to, his, senses, and, according, to, descartes, this, is, evidence, of, the, existence, of, something, outside, of, his, mind, and, thus, an, external, world, descartes, goes, on, to, argue, that, the, things, in, the, external, world, are, material, by, arguing, that, god, would, not, deceive, him, as, to, the, ideas, that, are, being, transmitted, and, that, god, has, given, him, the, propensity, to, believe, that, such, ideas, are, caused, by, material, things, descartes, also, believes, a, substance, is, something, that, does, not, need, any, assistance, to, function, or, exist, descartes, further, explains, how, only, god, can, be, a, true, substance, but, minds, are, substances, meaning, they, need, only, god, for, it, to, function, the, mind, is, a, thinking, substance, the, means, for, a, thinking, substance, stem, from, ideas, descartes, steered, clear, of, theological, questions, restricting, his, attention, to, showing, that, there, is, no, incompatibility, between, his, metaphysics, and, theological, orthodoxy, he, avoided, trying, to, demonstrate, theological, dogmas, metaphysically, when, challenged, that, he, had, not, established, the, immortality, of, the, soul, merely, in, showing, that, the, soul, and, the, body, are, distinct, substances, he, replied, i, do, not, take, it, upon, myself, to, try, to, use, the, power, of, human, reason, to, settle, any, of, those, matters, which, depend, on, the, free, will, of, god, descartes, invented, the, convention, of, representing, unknowns, in, equations, by, x, y, and, z, and, knowns, by, a, b, and, c, he, also, pioneered, the, standard, notation, that, uses, superscripts, to, show, the, powers, or, exponents, for, example, the, 2, used, in, x, 2, to, indicate, x, squared, 19, one, of, descartes, most, enduring, legacies, was, his, development, of, cartesian, or, analytic, geometry, which, uses, algebra, to, describe, geometry, the, cartesian, coordinate, system, is, named, after, him, he, was, first, to, assign, a, fundamental, place, for, algebra, in, the, system, of, knowledge, using, it, as, a, method, to, automate, or, mechanize, reasoning, particularly, about, abstract, unknown, quantities, 91, 114, european, mathematicians, had, previously, viewed, geometry, as, a, more, fundamental, form, of, mathematics, serving, as, the, foundation, of, algebra, algebraic, rules, were, given, geometric, proofs, by, mathematicians, such, as, pacioli, cardano, tartaglia, and, ferrari, equations, of, degree, higher, than, the, third, were, regarded, as, unreal, because, a, three, dimensional, form, such, as, a, cube, occupied, the, largest, dimension, of, reality, descartes, professed, that, the, abstract, quantity, a, 2, could, represent, length, as, well, as, an, area, this, was, in, opposition, to, the, teachings, of, mathematicians, such, as, fran, ois, vi, te, who, insisted, that, a, second, power, must, represent, an, area, although, descartes, did, not, pursue, the, subject, he, preceded, gottfried, wilhelm, leibniz, in, envisioning, a, more, general, science, of, algebra, or, universal, mathematics, as, a, precursor, to, symbolic, logic, that, could, encompass, logical, principles, and, methods, symbolically, and, mechanize, general, reasoning, 280, 281, current, popular, opinion, holds, that, descartes, had, the, most, influence, of, anyone, on, the, young, isaac, newton, and, this, is, arguably, one, of, his, most, important, contributions, descartes, influence, extended, not, directly, from, his, original, french, edition, of, la, g, om, trie, however, but, rather, from, frans, van, schooten, s, expanded, second, latin, edition, of, the, work, 100, newton, continued, descartes, work, on, cubic, equations, which, freed, the, subject, from, fetters, of, the, greek, perspectives, the, most, important, concept, was, his, very, modern, treatment, of, single, variables, 109, 129, descartes, work, provided, the, basis, for, the, calculus, developed, by, leibniz, and, newton, who, applied, the, infinitesimal, calculus, to, the, tangent, line, problem, thus, permitting, the, evolution, of, that, branch, of, modern, mathematics, his, rule, of, signs, is, also, a, commonly, used, method, to, determine, the, number, of, positive, and, negative, roots, of, a, polynomial, descartes, is, often, regarded, as, the, first, thinker, to, emphasize, the, use, of, reason, to, develop, the, natural, sciences, for, him, philosophy, was, a, thinking, system, that, embodied, all, knowledge, as, he, related, in, a, letter, to, a, french, translator, thus, all, philosophy, is, like, a, tree, of, which, metaphysics, is, the, root, physics, the, trunk, and, all, the, other, sciences, the, branches, that, grow, out, of, this, trunk, which, are, reduced, to, three, principals, namely, medicine, mechanics, and, ethics, by, the, science, of, morals, i, understand, the, highest, and, most, perfect, which, presupposing, an, entire, knowledge, of, the, other, sciences, is, the, last, degree, of, wisdom, the, beginning, to, descartes, interest, in, physics, is, accredited, to, the, amateur, scientist, and, mathematician, isaac, beeckman, whom, he, met, in, 1618, and, who, was, at, the, forefront, of, a, new, school, of, thought, known, as, mechanical, philosophy, with, this, foundation, of, reasoning, descartes, formulated, many, of, his, theories, on, mechanical, and, geometric, physics, it, is, said, that, they, met, when, both, were, looking, at, a, placard, that, was, set, up, in, the, breda, marketplace, detailing, a, mathematical, problem, to, be, solved, descartes, asked, beeckman, to, translate, the, problem, from, dutch, to, french, in, their, following, meetings, beeckman, interested, descartes, in, his, corpuscularian, approach, to, mechanical, theory, and, convinced, him, to, devote, his, studies, to, a, mathematical, approach, to, nature, in, 1628, beeckman, also, introduced, him, to, many, of, galileo, s, ideas, together, they, worked, on, free, fall, catenaries, conic, sections, and, fluid, statics, both, believed, that, it, was, necessary, to, create, a, method, that, thoroughly, linked, mathematics, and, physics, although, the, concept, of, work, in, physics, was, not, formally, used, until, 1826, similar, concepts, existed, before, then, in, 1637, descartes, wrote, lifting, 100, lb, one, foot, twice, over, is, the, same, as, lifting, 200, lb, one, foot, or, 100, lb, two, feet, in, principles, of, philosophy, principia, philosophiae, from, 1644, descartes, outlined, his, views, on, the, universe, in, it, he, describes, his, three, laws, of, motion, newton, s, own, laws, of, motion, would, later, be, modeled, on, descartes, exposition, descartes, defined, quantity, of, motion, latin, quantitas, motus, as, the, product, of, size, and, speed, and, claimed, that, the, total, quantity, of, motion, in, the, universe, is, conserved, if, x, is, twice, the, size, of, y, and, is, moving, half, as, fast, then, there, s, the, same, amount, of, motion, in, each, created, matter, along, with, its, motion, merely, by, letting, things, run, their, course, he, preserves, the, same, amount, of, motion, as, he, put, there, in, the, beginning, descartes, had, discovered, an, early, form, of, the, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, he, envisioned, quantity, of, motion, as, pertaining, to, motion, in, a, straight, line, as, opposed, to, perfect, circular, motion, as, galileo, had, envisioned, it, descartes, discovery, should, not, be, seen, as, the, modern, law, of, conservation, of, momentum, since, it, had, no, concept, of, mass, as, distinct, from, weight, or, size, and, since, he, believed, that, it, is, speed, rather, than, velocity, that, is, conserved, descartes, vortex, theory, of, planetary, motion, was, later, rejected, by, newton, in, favor, of, his, law, of, universal, gravitation, and, most, of, the, second, book, of, newton, s, principia, is, devoted, to, his, counterargument, descartes, also, made, contributions, to, the, field, of, optics, he, showed, by, using, geometric, construction, and, the, law, of, refraction, also, known, as, descartes, law, or, more, commonly, snell, s, law, outside, france, that, the, angular, radius, of, a, rainbow, is, 42, degrees, i, e, the, angle, subtended, at, the, eye, by, the, edge, of, the, rainbow, and, the, ray, passing, from, the, sun, through, the, rainbow, s, centre, is, 42, he, also, independently, discovered, the, law, of, reflection, and, his, essay, on, optics, was, the, first, published, mention, of, this, law, within, discourse, on, the, method, there, is, an, appendix, in, which, descartes, discusses, his, theories, on, meteorology, known, as, les, m, t, ores, he, first, proposed, the, idea, that, the, elements, were, made, up, of, small, particles, that, join, together, imperfectly, thus, leaving, small, spaces, in, between, these, spaces, were, then, filled, with, smaller, much, quicker, subtile, matter, these, particles, were, different, based, on, what, element, they, constructed, for, example, descartes, believed, that, particles, of, water, were, like, little, eels, which, though, they, join, and, twist, around, each, other, do, not, for, all, that, ever, knot, or, hook, together, in, such, a, way, that, they, cannot, easily, be, separated, in, contrast, the, particles, that, made, up, the, more, solid, material, were, constructed, in, a, way, that, generated, irregular, shapes, the, size, of, the, particle, also, matters, if, the, particle, was, smaller, not, only, was, it, faster, and, constantly, moving, it, was, more, easily, agitated, by, the, larger, particles, which, were, slow, but, had, more, force, the, different, qualities, such, as, combinations, and, shapes, gave, rise, to, different, secondary, qualities, of, materials, such, as, temperature, this, first, idea, is, the, basis, for, the, rest, of, descartes, theory, on, meteorology, while, rejecting, most, of, aristotle, s, theories, on, meteorology, he, still, kept, some, of, the, terminology, that, aristotle, used, such, as, vapors, and, exhalations, these, vapors, would, be, drawn, into, the, sky, by, the, sun, from, terrestrial, substances, and, would, generate, wind, descartes, also, theorized, that, falling, clouds, would, displace, the, air, below, them, also, generating, wind, falling, clouds, could, also, generate, thunder, he, theorized, that, when, a, cloud, rests, above, another, cloud, and, the, air, around, the, top, cloud, is, hot, it, condenses, the, vapor, around, the, top, cloud, and, causes, the, particles, to, fall, when, the, particles, falling, from, the, top, cloud, collided, with, the, bottom, cloud, s, particles, it, would, create, thunder, he, compared, his, theory, on, thunder, to, his, theory, on, avalanches, descartes, believed, that, the, booming, sound, that, avalanches, created, was, due, to, snow, that, was, heated, and, therefore, heavier, falling, onto, the, snow, that, was, below, it, this, theory, was, supported, by, experience, it, follows, that, one, can, understand, why, it, thunders, more, rarely, in, winter, than, in, summer, for, then, not, enough, heat, reaches, the, highest, clouds, in, order, to, break, them, up, another, theory, that, descartes, had, was, on, the, production, of, lightning, descartes, believed, that, lightning, was, caused, by, exhalations, trapped, between, the, two, colliding, clouds, he, believed, that, in, order, to, make, these, exhalations, viable, to, produce, lightning, they, had, to, be, made, fine, and, inflammable, by, hot, and, dry, weather, whenever, the, clouds, would, collide, it, would, cause, them, to, ignite, creating, lightning, if, the, cloud, above, was, heavier, than, the, bottom, cloud, it, would, also, produce, thunder, descartes, also, believed, that, clouds, were, made, up, of, drops, of, water, and, ice, and, believed, that, rain, would, fall, whenever, the, air, could, no, longer, support, them, it, would, fall, as, snow, if, the, air, was, not, warm, enough, to, melt, the, raindrops, and, hail, was, when, the, cloud, drops, would, melt, and, then, freeze, again, because, cold, air, would, refreeze, them, descartes, did, not, use, mathematics, or, instruments, as, there, were, not, any, at, the, time, to, back, up, his, theories, on, meteorology, and, instead, used, qualitative, reasoning, in, order, to, deduce, his, hypothesis, descartes, has, often, been, dubbed, the, father, of, modern, western, philosophy, the, thinker, whose, approaches, has, profoundly, changed, the, course, of, western, philosophy, and, set, the, basis, for, modernity, the, first, two, of, his, meditations, on, first, philosophy, those, that, formulate, the, famous, methodic, doubt, represent, the, portion, of, descartes, writings, that, most, influenced, modern, thinking, it, has, been, argued, that, descartes, himself, did, not, realize, the, extent, of, this, revolutionary, move, in, shifting, the, debate, from, what, is, true, to, of, what, can, i, be, certain, descartes, arguably, shifted, the, authoritative, guarantor, of, truth, from, god, to, humanity, even, though, descartes, himself, claimed, he, received, his, visions, from, god, while, the, traditional, concept, of, truth, implies, an, external, authority, certainty, instead, relies, on, the, judgment, of, the, individual, in, an, anthropocentric, revolution, the, human, being, is, now, raised, to, the, level, of, a, subject, an, agent, an, emancipated, being, equipped, with, autonomous, reason, this, was, a, revolutionary, step, that, established, the, basis, of, modernity, the, repercussions, of, which, are, still, being, felt, the, emancipation, of, humanity, from, christian, revelational, truth, and, church, doctrine, humanity, making, its, own, law, and, taking, its, own, stand, in, modernity, the, guarantor, of, truth, is, not, god, anymore, but, human, beings, each, of, whom, is, a, self, conscious, shaper, and, guarantor, of, their, own, reality, in, that, way, each, person, is, turned, into, a, reasoning, adult, a, subject, and, agent, as, opposed, to, a, child, obedient, to, god, this, change, in, perspective, was, characteristic, of, the, shift, from, the, christian, medieval, period, to, the, modern, period, a, shift, that, had, been, anticipated, in, other, fields, and, which, was, now, being, formulated, in, the, field, of, philosophy, by, descartes, this, anthropocentric, perspective, of, descartes, work, establishing, human, reason, as, autonomous, provided, the, basis, for, the, enlightenment, s, emancipation, from, god, and, the, church, according, to, martin, heidegger, the, perspective, of, descartes, work, also, provided, the, basis, for, all, subsequent, anthropology, descartes, philosophical, revolution, is, sometimes, said, to, have, sparked, modern, anthropocentrism, and, subjectivism, in, commercial, terms, the, discourse, appeared, during, descartes, lifetime, in, a, single, edition, of, 500, copies, 200, of, which, were, set, aside, for, the, author, sharing, a, similar, fate, was, the, only, french, edition, of, the, meditations, which, had, not, managed, to, sell, out, by, the, time, of, descartes, death, a, concomitant, latin, edition, of, the, latter, was, however, eagerly, sought, out, by, europe, s, scholarly, community, and, proved, a, commercial, success, for, descartes, xliii, xliv, although, descartes, was, well, known, in, academic, circles, towards, the, end, of, his, life, the, teaching, of, his, works, in, schools, was, controversial, henri, de, roy, henricus, regius, 1598, 1679, professor, of, medicine, at, the, university, of, utrecht, was, condemned, by, the, rector, of, the, university, gijsbert, voet, voetius, for, teaching, descartes, physics, according, to, philosophy, professor, john, cottingham, descartes, s, meditations, on, first, philosophy, is, considered, to, be, one, of, the, key, texts, of, western, philosophy, cottingham, said, that, the, meditations, is, the, most, widely, studied, of, all, descartes, writings, 50, according, to, anthony, gottlieb, a, former, senior, editor, of, the, economist, and, the, author, of, the, dream, of, reason, and, the, dream, of, enlightenment, one, of, the, reasons, descartes, and, thomas, hobbes, continue, to, be, debated, in, the, second, decade, of, the, twenty, first, century, is, that, they, still, have, something, to, say, to, us, that, remains, relevant, on, questions, such, as, what, does, the, advance, of, science, entail, for, our, understanding, of, ourselves, and, our, ideas, of, god, and, how, is, government, to, deal, with, religious, diversity, in, her, 2018, interview, with, tyler, cowen, agnes, callard, described, descartes, thought, experiment, in, the, meditations, where, he, encouraged, a, complete, systematic, doubting, of, everything, that, you, believe, to, see, what, you, come, to, she, said, what, descartes, comes, to, is, a, kind, of, real, truth, that, he, can, build, upon, inside, of, his, own, mind, she, said, that, hamlet, s, monologues, meditations, on, the, nature, of, life, and, emotion, were, similar, to, descartes, thought, experiment, hamlet, descartes, were, apart, from, the, world, as, if, they, were, trapped, in, their, own, heads, cowen, asked, callard, if, descartes, actually, found, any, truths, through, his, thought, experiment, or, was, it, just, an, earlier, version, of, the, contemporary, argument, that, we, re, living, in, a, simulation, where, the, evil, demon, is, the, simulation, rather, than, bayesian, reasoning, callard, agreed, that, this, argument, can, be, traced, to, descartes, who, had, said, that, he, had, refuted, it, she, clarified, that, in, descartes, reasoning, you, do, end, up, back, in, the, mind, of, god, in, a, universe, god, has, created, that, is, the, real, world, the, whole, question, is, about, being, connected, to, reality, as, opposed, to, being, a, figment, if, you, re, living, in, the, world, god, created, god, can, create, real, things, so, you, re, living, in, a, real, world, the, membership, of, descartes, to, the, rosicrucians, is, debated, the, initials, of, his, name, have, been, linked, to, the, r, c, acronym, widely, used, by, rosicrucians, furthermore, in, 1619, descartes, moved, to, ulm, which, was, a, well, renowned, international, center, of, the, rosicrucian, movement, during, his, journey, in, germany, he, met, johannes, faulhaber, who, had, previously, expressed, his, personal, commitment, to, join, the, brotherhood, descartes, dedicated, the, work, titled, the, mathematical, treasure, trove, of, polybius, citizen, of, the, world, to, learned, men, throughout, the, world, and, especially, to, the, distinguished, b, r, c, brothers, of, the, rosy, cross, in, germany, the, work, was, not, completed, and, its, publication, is, uncertain, in, january, 2010, a, previously, unknown, letter, from, descartes, dated, 27, may, 1641, was, found, by, the, dutch, philosopher, erik, jan, bos, when, browsing, through, google, bos, found, the, letter, mentioned, in, a, summary, of, autographs, kept, by, haverford, college, in, haverford, pennsylvania, the, college, was, unaware, that, the, letter, had, never, been, published, this, was, the, third, letter, by, descartes, found, in, the, last, 25, years, the, descartes, most, familiar, to, twentieth, century, philosophers, is, the, descartes, of, the, first, two, meditations, someone, preoccupied, with, hyperbolic, doubt, of, the, material, world, and, the, certainty, of, knowledge, of, the, self, that, emerges, from, the, famous, cogito, argument, for, up, to, descartes, a, particular, sub, iectum, lies, at, the, foundation, of, its, own, fixed, qualities, and, changing, circumstances, the, superiority, of, a, sub, iectum, arises, out, of, the, claim, of, man, to, a, self, supported, unshakeable, foundation, of, truth, in, the, sense, of, certainty, why, and, how, does, this, claim, acquire, its, decisive, authority, the, claim, originates, in, that, emancipation, of, man, in, which, he, frees, himself, from, obligation, to, christian, revelational, truth, and, church, doctrine, to, a, legislating, for, himself, that, takes, its, stand, upon, itself, with, the, interpretation, of, man, as, subiectum, descartes, creates, the, metaphysical, presupposition, for, future, anthropology, of, every, kind, and, tendency, the, kind, of, anthropocentric, subjectivism, which, has, emerged, from, the, cartesian, revolution, when, with, the, beginning, of, modern, times, religious, belief, was, becoming, more, and, more, externalized, as, a, lifeless, convention, men, of, intellect, were, lifted, by, a, new, belief, their, great, belief, in, an, autonomous, philosophy, and, science, in, philosophy, the, meditations, were, epoch, making, in, a, quite, unique, sense, and, precisely, because, of, their, going, back, to, the, pure, ego, cogito, descartes, work, has, been, used, in, fact, to, inaugurates, an, entirely, new, kind, of, philosophy, changing, its, total, style, philosophy, takes, a, radical, turn, from, na, ve, objectivism, to, transcendental, subjectivism
