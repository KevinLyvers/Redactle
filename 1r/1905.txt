body, being, between, the, defender, and, the, ball, made, it, further, difficult, to, block, as, did, extending, his, non, shooting, arm, to, fend, off, opponents, he, was, stronger, shooting, the, skyhook, with, his, right, hand, than, he, was, with, his, left, which, he, developed, in, his, later, years, according, to, abdul, jabbar, he, learned, the, move, in, fifth, grade, after, practicing,
