collegium, ministries, were, abolished, and, replaced, by, the, council, of, ministers, state, council, and, supreme, court, to, improve, the, legal, system, plans, were, made, but, never, consummated, to, set, up, a, parliament, and, sign, a, constitution, in, contrast, to, his, westernizing, predecessors, such, as, peter, the, great, alexander, was, a, russian, nationalist, and, slavophile, who, wanted, russia, to, develop, on, the, basis, of, russian, culture, rather, than, european, in, foreign, policy, he, changed, russia, s, position, towards, france, four, times,

the, continental, system, alexander, and, napoleon, hardly, agreed, especially, regarding, poland, and, the, alliance, collapsed, by, 1810, alexander, s, greatest, triumph, came, in, 1812, when, napoleon, s, invasion, of, russia, descended, into, a, catastrophe, for, the, french, as, part, of, the, winning, coalition, against, napoleon, he, gained, territory, in, finland, and, poland, he, formed, the, holy, alliance, to, suppress, the, revolutionary, movements, in, europe, which, he, saw, as, immoral, threats, to, legitimate, christian, monarchs, he, also, helped, austria, s, klemens, von, metternich, in, suppressing, all, national, and, liberal, movements, during, the, second, half, of, his, reign, alexander, became, increasingly, arbitrary, reactionary, and, fearful, of, plots, against, him, as, a, result, he, ended, many, of, the, reforms, he, had, made, earlier, on, his, reign, he, purged, schools, of, foreign, teachers, as, education, became, more, religiously, driven,

wanted, to, become, emperor, after, a, period, of, great, confusion, that, presaged, the, failed, decembrist, revolt, of, liberal, army, officers, in, the, weeks, after, his, death, he, was, succeeded, by, his, younger, brother, nicholas, i, alexander, was, born, at, 10, 45, on, 23, december, 1777, in, saint, petersburg, and, he, and, his, younger, brother, constantine, were, raised, by,

patron, saint, of, saint, petersburg, as, competing, aspects, of, his, upbringing, he, imbibed, the, principles, of, rousseau, s, gospel, of, humanity, from, the, free, thinking, atmosphere, of, the, court, of, catherine, and, his, swiss, tutor, fr, d, ric, c, sar, de, la, harpe, whereas, he, imbibed, the, traditions, of, russian, autocracy, from, his, military, governor, nikolay, saltykov, andrey, afanasyevich, samborsky, whom, his, grandmother, chose, to, be, his, religious, instructor, was, an, atypical, unbearded, orthodox, priest, samborsky, had, long, lived, in, england, and, taught, alexander, and, his, brother, constantine, excellent, english, a, very, uncommon, accouterment, for, potential, russian, autocrats, of, the, time, on, 9, october, 1793, when, alexander, was, still, 15, years, old, he, married, 14, year, old, princess, louise, of, baden, who, took, the, name, elizabeth, alexeievna, his, grandmother, was, the, one, who, presided, over, his, marriage, to, the, young, princess, until, his, grandmother, s, death, he, was, constantly, walking, the, line, of, allegiance, between, his, grandmother, and, his, father, his, steward, nikolai, saltykov, helped, him, navigate, the, political, landscape, engendering, dislike, for, his, grandmother, and, dread, in, dealing, with, his, father, catherine, had, the, alexander, palace, built, for, the, couple, this, did, nothing, to, help, his, relationship, with, her, as, catherine, would, go, out, of, her, way, to, amuse, them, with, dancing, and, parties, which, annoyed, his, wife, living, at, the, palace, also, put, pressure, on, him, to, perform, as, a, husband, though, he, felt, only, a, brother, s, love, for, the, grand, duchess, he, began, to, sympathize, more, with, his, father, as, he, saw, visiting, his, father, s, fiefdom, at, gatchina, palace, as, a, relief, from, the, ostentatious, court, of, the, empress, there, they, wore, simple, prussian, military, uniforms, instead, of, the, gaudy, clothing, popular, at, the, french, court, they, had, to, wear, when, visiting, catherine, even, so, visiting, the, tsarevich, did, not, come, without, a, bit, of, travail, paul, liked, to, have, his, guests, perform, military, drills, which, he, also, pushed, upon, his, sons, alexander, and, constantine, he, was, also, prone, to, fits, of, temper, and, he, often, went, into, fits, of, rage, when, events, did, not, go, his, way, some, sources, allege, that, the, empress, catherine, planned, to, remove, her, son, paul, from, the, succession, altogether, in, consideration, of, his, unstable, temperament, and, bizarre, personality, traits, and, make, alexander, her, successor, instead, catherine, s, death, in, november, 1796, brought, her, son, paul, to, the, throne, before, she, could, appoint, alexander, as, her, successor, alexander, disliked, his, father, as, emperor, even, more, than, he, did, his, grandmother, he, wrote, that, russia, had, become, a, plaything, for, the, insane, and, that, absolute, power, disrupts, everything, it, is, likely, that, seeing, two, previous, rulers, abuse, their, autocratic, powers, in, such, a, way, pushed, him, to, be, one, of, the, more, progressive, romanov, tsars, of, the, 19th, century, in, the, country, as, a, whole, paul, was, widely, unpopular, he, accused, his, wife, of, conspiring, to, become, another, catherine, and, seize, power, from, him, as, his, mother, did, from, his, father, he, also, suspected, alexander, of, conspiring, against, him, alexander, became, emperor, of, russia, when, his, father, was, assassinated, on, 23, march, 1801, alexander, then, 23, years, old, was, in, the, saint, michael, s, castle, at, the, moment, of, the, assassination, and, his, accession, to, the, throne, was, announced, by, general, nicholas, zubov, one, of, the, assassins, historians, still, debate, alexander, s, role, in, his, father, s, murder, the, most, common, theory, is, that, he, was, let, into, the, conspirators, secret, and, was, willing, to, take, the, throne, but, insisted, that, his, father, should, not, be, killed, becoming, emperor, through, a, crime, that, cost, his, father, s, life, would, give, alexander, a, strong, sense, of, remorse, and, shame, alexander, i, succeeded, to, the, throne, that, day, and, was, crowned, in, the, kremlin, on, 15, september, of, that, year, the, orthodox, church, initially, exercised, little, influence, on, alexander, s, life, the, young, emperor, was, determined, to, reform, the, inefficient, highly, centralised, systems, of, government, that, russia, relied, upon, while, retaining, for, a, time, the, old, ministers, one, of, the, first, acts, of, his, reign, was, to, appoint, the, private, committee, comprising, young, and, enthusiastic, friends, of, his, own, viktor, kochubey, nikolay, novosiltsev, pavel, stroganov, and, adam, jerzy, czartoryski, to, draw, up, a, plan, of, domestic, reform, which, was, supposed, to, result, in, the, establishment, of, a, constitutional, monarchy, in, accordance, with, the, teachings, of, the, age, of, enlightenment, a, few, years, into, his, reign, the, liberal, mikhail, speransky, became, one, of, the, emperor, s, closest, advisors, and, he, drew, up, elaborate, plans, for, reforms, in, the, government, reform, the, old, collegia, were, abolished, and, new, ministries, were, created, in, their, place, led, by, ministers, responsible, to, the, crown, a, council, of, ministers, under, the, chairmanship, of, the, sovereign, dealt, with, all, interdepartmental, matters, the, state, council, was, created, to, improve, the, technique, of, legislation, it, was, intended, to, become, the, second, chamber, of, a, representative, legislature, the, governing, senate, was, reorganized, as, the, supreme, court, of, the, empire, the, codification, of, the, laws, initiated, in, 1801, was, never, carried, out, during, his, reign, alexander, wanted, to, resolve, another, crucial, issue, in, russia, the, status, of, the, serfs, although, this, was, not, achieved, until, 1861, during, the, reign, of, his, nephew, alexander, ii, his, advisors, quietly, discussed, the, options, at, length, cautiously, he, extended, the, right, to, own, land, to, most, classes, of, subjects, including, state, owned, peasants, in, 1801, and, created, a, new, social, category, of, free, agriculturalist, for, peasants, voluntarily, emancipated, by, their, masters, in, 1803, the, great, majority, of, serfs, were, not, affected, when, alexander, s, reign, began, there, were, three, universities, in, russia, at, moscow, vilna, vilnius, and, dorpat, tartu, these, were, strengthened, and, three, others, were, founded, at, st, petersburg, kharkiv, and, kazan, literary, and, scientific, bodies, were, established, or, encouraged, and, his, reign, became, noted, for, the, aid, lent, to, the, sciences, and, arts, by, the, emperor, and, the, wealthy, nobility, alexander, later, expelled, foreign, scholars, after, 1815, the, military, settlements, farms, worked, by, soldiers, and, their, families, under, military, control, were, introduced, with, the, idea, of, making, the, army, or, part, of, it, self, supporting, economically, and, for, providing, it, with, recruits, called, both, an, autocrat, and, jacobin, a, man, of, the, world, and, a, mystic, alexander, appeared, to, his, contemporaries, as, a, riddle, which, each, read, according, to, his, own, temperament, napoleon, bonaparte, thought, him, a, shifty, byzantine, and, called, him, the, talma, of, the, north, as, ready, to, play, any, conspicuous, part, to, metternich, he, was, a, madman, to, be, humoured, castlereagh, writing, of, him, to, lord, liverpool, gave, him, credit, for, grand, qualities, but, added, that, he, is, suspicious, and, undecided, and, to, jefferson, he, was, a, man, of, estimable, character, disposed, to, do, good, and, expected, to, diffuse, through, the, mass, of, the, russian, people, a, sense, of, their, natural, rights, in, 1803, beethoven, dedicated, his, opus, 30, violin, sonatas, to, alexander, who, in, response, gave, the, famous, composer, a, diamond, at, the, congress, of, vienna, where, they, met, in, 1814, upon, his, accession, alexander, reversed, many, of, the, unpopular, policies, of, his, father, paul, denounced, the, league, of, armed, neutrality, and, made, peace, with, britain, april, 1801, at, the, same, time, he, opened, negotiations, with, francis, ii, holy, roman, emperor, soon, afterwards, at, memel, he, entered, into, a, close, alliance, with, prussia, not, as, he, boasted, from, motives, of, policy, but, in, the, spirit, of, true, chivalry, out, of, friendship, for, the, young, king, frederick, william, iii, and, his, beautiful, wife, louise, of, mecklenburg, strelitz, the, development, of, this, alliance, was, interrupted, by, the, short, lived, peace, of, october, 1801, and, for, a, while, it, seemed, as, though, france, and, russia, might, come, to, an, understanding, carried, away, by, the, enthusiasm, of, fr, d, ric, c, sar, de, la, harpe, who, had, returned, to, russia, from, paris, alexander, began, openly, to, proclaim, his, admiration, for, french, institutions, and, for, the, person, of, napoleon, bonaparte, soon, however, came, a, change, la, harpe, after, a, new, visit, to, paris, presented, to, alexander, his, reflections, on, the, true, nature, of, the, consul, for, life, which, as, alexander, said, tore, the, veil, from, his, eyes, and, revealed, bonaparte, as, not, a, true, patriot, but, only, as, the, most, famous, tyrant, the, world, has, produced, later, on, la, harpe, and, his, friend, henri, monod, lobbied, alexander, who, persuaded, the, other, allied, powers, opposing, napoleon, to, recognise, vaudois, and, argovian, independence, in, spite, of, bern, s, attempts, to, reclaim, them, as, subject, lands, alexander, s, disillusionment, was, completed, by, the, execution, of, the, duc, d, enghien, on, trumped, up, charges, the, russian, court, went, into, mourning, for, the, last, member, of, the, house, of, cond, and, diplomatic, relations, with, france, were, broken, off, alexander, was, especially, alarmed, and, decided, he, had, to, somehow, curb, napoleon, s, power, in, opposing, napoleon, i, the, oppressor, of, europe, and, the, disturber, of, the, world, s, peace, alexander, in, fact, already, believed, himself, to, be, fulfilling, a, divine, mission, in, his, instructions, to, niklolay, novosiltsev, his, special, envoy, in, london, the, emperor, elaborated, the, motives, of, his, policy, in, language, that, appealed, little, to, the, prime, minister, william, pitt, the, younger, yet, the, document, is, of, great, interest, as, it, formulates, for, the, first, time, in, an, official, dispatch, the, ideals, of, international, policy, that, were, to, play, a, conspicuous, part, in, world, affairs, at, the, close, of, the, revolutionary, epoch, alexander, argued, that, the, outcome, of, the, war, was, not, only, to, be, the, liberation, of, france, but, the, universal, triumph, of, the, sacred, rights, of, humanity, to, attain, this, it, would, be, necessary, after, having, attached, the, nations, to, their, government, by, making, these, incapable, of, acting, save, in, the, greatest, interests, of, their, subjects, to, fix, the, relations, of, the, states, amongst, each, other, on, more, precise, rules, and, such, as, it, is, to, their, interest, to, respect, a, general, treaty, was, to, become, the, main, basis, of, the, relations, of, the, states, forming, the, european, confederation, while, he, believed, the, effort, would, not, attain, universal, peace, it, would, be, worthwhile, if, it, established, clear, principles, for, the, prescriptions, of, the, rights, of, nations, the, body, would, assure, the, positive, rights, of, nations, and, the, privilege, of, neutrality, while, asserting, the, obligation, to, exhaust, all, resources, of, mediation, to, retain, peace, and, would, form, a, new, code, of, the, law, of, nations, meanwhile, napoleon, a, little, deterred, by, the, russian, autocrat, s, youthful, ideology, never, gave, up, hope, of, detaching, him, from, the, coalition, he, had, no, sooner, entered, vienna, in, triumph, than, he, opened, negotiations, with, alexander, he, resumed, them, after, the, battle, of, austerlitz, 2, december, russia, and, france, he, urged, were, geographical, allies, there, was, and, could, be, between, them, no, true, conflict, of, interests, together, they, might, rule, the, world, but, alexander, was, still, determined, to, persist, in, the, system, of, disinterestedness, in, respect, of, all, the, states, of, europe, which, he, had, thus, far, followed, and, he, again, allied, himself, with, the, kingdom, of, prussia, the, campaign, of, jena, and, the, battle, of, eylau, followed, and, napoleon, though, still, intent, on, the, russian, alliance, stirred, up, poles, turks, and, persians, to, break, the, obstinacy, of, the, tsar, a, party, too, in, russia, itself, headed, by, the, tsar, s, brother, constantine, pavlovich, was, clamorous, for, peace, but, alexander, after, a, vain, attempt, to, form, a, new, coalition, summoned, the, russian, nation, to, a, holy, war, against, napoleon, as, the, enemy, of, the, orthodox, faith, the, outcome, was, the, rout, of, friedland, 13, 14, june, 1807, napoleon, saw, his, chance, and, seized, it, instead, of, demanding, harsh, peace, terms, he, offered, to, the, chastened, autocrat, his, alliance, and, a, partnership, in, his, glory, the, two, emperors, met, at, tilsit, on, 25, june, 1807, napoleon, knew, well, how, to, appeal, to, the, exuberant, imagination, of, his, new, found, friend, he, would, divide, with, alexander, the, empire, of, the, world, as, a, first, step, he, would, leave, him, in, possession, of, the, danubian, principalities, and, give, him, a, free, hand, to, deal, with, finland, and, afterwards, the, emperors, of, the, east, and, west, when, the, time, should, be, ripe, would, drive, the, turks, from, europe, and, march, across, asia, to, the, conquest, of, india, nevertheless, a, thought, awoke, in, alexander, s, impressionable, mind, an, ambition, to, which, he, had, hitherto, been, a, stranger, the, interests, of, europe, as, a, whole, were, utterly, forgotten, the, brilliance, of, these, new, visions, did, not, however, blind, alexander, to, the, obligations, of, friendship, and, he, refused, to, retain, the, danubian, principalities, as, the, price, for, suffering, a, further, dismemberment, of, prussia, we, have, made, loyal, war, he, said, we, must, make, a, loyal, peace, it, was, not, long, before, the, first, enthusiasm, of, tilsit, began, to, wane, the, french, remained, in, prussia, the, russians, on, the, danube, and, each, accused, the, other, of, breach, of, faith, meanwhile, however, the, personal, relations, of, alexander, and, napoleon, were, of, the, most, cordial, character, and, it, was, hoped, that, a, fresh, meeting, might, adjust, all, differences, between, them, the, meeting, took, place, at, erfurt, in, october, 1808, and, resulted, in, a, treaty, that, defined, the, common, policy, of, the, two, emperors, but, alexander, s, relations, with, napoleon, nonetheless, suffered, a, change, he, realised, that, in, napoleon, sentiment, never, got, the, better, of, reason, that, as, a, matter, of, fact, he, had, never, intended, his, proposed, grand, enterprise, seriously, and, had, only, used, it, to, preoccupy, the, mind, of, the, tsar, while, he, consolidated, his, own, power, in, central, europe, from, this, moment, the, french, alliance, was, for, alexander, also, not, a, fraternal, agreement, to, rule, the, world, but, an, affair, of, pure, policy, he, used, it, initially, to, remove, the, geographical, enemy, from, the, gates, of, saint, petersburg, by, wresting, finland, from, sweden, 1809, and, he, hoped, further, to, make, the, danube, the, southern, frontier, of, russia, events, were, rapidly, heading, towards, the, rupture, of, the, franco, russian, alliance, while, alexander, assisted, napoleon, in, the, war, of, the, fifth, coalition, in, 1809, he, declared, plainly, that, he, would, not, allow, the, austrian, empire, to, be, crushed, out, of, existence, napoleon, subsequently, complained, bitterly, of, the, inactivity, of, the, russian, troops, during, the, campaign, the, tsar, in, turn, protested, against, napoleon, s, encouragement, of, the, poles, in, the, matter, of, the, french, alliance, he, knew, himself, to, be, practically, isolated, in, russia, and, he, declared, that, he, could, not, sacrifice, the, interest, of, his, people, and, empire, to, his, affection, for, napoleon, i, don, t, want, anything, for, myself, he, said, to, the, french, ambassador, therefore, the, world, is, not, large, enough, to, come, to, an, understanding, on, the, affairs, of, poland, if, it, is, a, question, of, its, restoration, alexander, complained, that, the, treaty, of, sch, nbrunn, which, added, largely, to, the, duchy, of, warsaw, had, ill, requited, him, for, his, loyalty, and, he, was, only, mollified, for, the, time, being, by, napoleon, s, public, declaration, that, he, had, no, intention, of, restoring, poland, and, by, a, convention, signed, on, 4, january, 1810, but, not, ratified, abolishing, the, polish, name, and, orders, of, chivalry, but, if, alexander, suspected, napoleon, s, intentions, napoleon, was, no, less, suspicious, of, alexander, partly, to, test, his, sincerity, napoleon, sent, an, almost, peremptory, request, for, the, hand, of, the, grand, duchess, anna, pavlovna, the, tsar, s, youngest, sister, after, some, little, delay, alexander, returned, a, polite, refusal, pleading, the, princess, s, tender, age, and, the, objection, of, the, dowager, empress, to, the, marriage, napoleon, s, answer, was, to, refuse, to, ratify, the, 4, january, convention, and, to, announce, his, engagement, to, the, archduchess, marie, louise, in, such, a, way, as, to, lead, alexander, to, suppose, that, the, two, marriage, treaties, had, been, negotiated, simultaneously, from, this, time, on, the, relationship, between, the, two, emperors, gradually, became, more, and, more, strained, another, personal, grievance, for, alexander, towards, napoleon, was, the, annexation, of, oldenburg, by, france, in, december, 1810, as, wilhelm, duke, of, oldenburg, 3, january, 1754, 2, july, 1823, was, the, uncle, of, the, tsar, furthermore, the, disastrous, impact, of, the, continental, system, on, russian, trade, made, it, impossible, for, the, emperor, to, maintain, a, policy, that, was, napoleon, s, chief, motive, for, the, alliance, alexander, kept, russia, as, neutral, as, possible, in, the, ongoing, french, war, with, britain, russia, s, own, war, with, britain, barely, any, more, than, nominal, he, allowed, trade, to, continue, secretly, with, britain, and, did, not, enforce, the, blockade, required, by, the, continental, system, in, 1810, he, withdrew, russia, from, the, continental, system, and, trade, between, britain, and, russia, grew, relations, between, france, and, russia, worsened, progressively, after, 1810, by, 1811, it, became, clear, that, napoleon, was, not, adhering, to, his, side, of, the, terms, of, the, treaty, of, tilsit, he, had, promised, assistance, to, russia, in, its, war, against, the, ottoman, empire, but, as, the, campaign, went, on, france, offered, no, support, at, all, with, war, imminent, between, france, and, russia, alexander, started, to, prepare, the, ground, diplomatically, in, april, 1812, russia, and, sweden, signed, a, treaty, for, mutual, defence, a, month, later, alexander, secured, his, southern, flank, through, the, treaty, of, bucharest, 1812, which, ended, the, war, against, the, ottomans, formally, his, diplomats, managed, to, extract, promises, from, prussia, and, austria, that, should, napoleon, invade, russia, the, former, would, help, napoleon, as, little, as, possible, and, that, the, latter, would, give, no, aid, at, all, the, minister, of, war, michael, andreas, barclay, de, tolly, had, managed, the, reform, and, improvement, of, the, imperial, russian, army, before, the, start, of, the, 1812, campaign, primarily, on, the, advice, of, his, sister, and, count, aleksey, arakcheyev, alexander, did, not, take, operational, control, as, he, had, done, during, the, 1805, campaign, instead, delegating, control, to, his, generals, barclay, de, tolly, prince, pyotr, bagration, and, mikhail, kutuzov, despite, brief, hostilities, in, the, persian, expedition, of, 1796, eight, years, of, peace, passed, before, a, new, conflict, erupted, between, the, two, empires, after, the, russian, annexation, of, the, georgian, kingdom, of, kartli, kakheti, in, 1801, a, subject, of, persia, for, centuries, and, the, incorporation, of, the, derbent, khanate, as, well, quickly, thereafter, alexander, was, determined, to, increase, and, maintain, russian, influence, in, the, strategically, valuable, caucasus, region, in, 1801, alexander, appointed, pavel, tsitsianov, a, die, hard, russian, imperialist, of, georgian, origin, as, russian, commander, in, chief, of, the, caucasus, between, 1802, and, 1804, he, proceeded, to, impose, russian, rule, on, western, georgia, and, some, of, the, persian, controlled, khanates, around, georgia, some, of, these, khanates, submitted, without, a, fight, but, the, ganja, khanate, resisted, prompting, an, attack, ganja, was, ruthlessly, sacked, during, the, siege, of, ganja, with, some, 3, 000, 7, 000, inhabitants, of, ganja, executed, and, thousands, more, expelled, to, persia, these, attacks, by, tsitsianov, formed, another, casus, belli, on, 23, may, 1804, persia, demanded, withdrawal, from, the, regions, russia, had, occupied, comprising, what, is, now, georgia, dagestan, and, parts, of, azerbaijan, russia, refused, stormed, ganja, and, declared, war, following, an, almost, ten, year, stalemate, centred, around, what, is, now, dagestan, east, georgia, azerbaijan, northern, armenia, with, neither, party, being, able, to, gain, the, clear, upper, hand, russia, eventually, managed, to, turn, the, tide, after, a, series, of, successful, offensives, led, by, general, pyotr, kotlyarevsky, including, a, decisive, victory, in, the, siege, of, lankaran, persia, was, forced, to, sue, for, peace, in, october, 1813, the, treaty, of, gulistan, negotiated, with, british, mediation, and, signed, at, gulistan, made, the, persian, shah, fath, ali, shah, cede, all, persian, territories, in, the, north, caucasus, and, most, of, its, territories, in, the, south, caucasus, to, russia, this, included, what, is, now, dagestan, georgia, and, most, of, azerbaijan, it, also, began, a, large, demographic, shift, in, the, caucasus, as, many, muslim, families, emigrated, to, persia, in, the, summer, of, 1812, napoleon, invaded, russia, it, was, the, occupation, of, moscow, and, the, desecration, of, the, kremlin, considered, to, be, the, sacred, centre, of, holy, russia, that, changed, alexander, s, sentiment, for, napoleon, into, passionate, hatred, the, campaign, of, 1812, was, the, turning, point, for, alexander, s, life, after, the, burning, of, moscow, he, declared, that, his, own, soul, had, found, illumination, and, that, he, had, realized, once, and, for, all, the, divine, revelation, to, him, of, his, mission, as, the, peacemaker, of, europe, while, the, russian, army, retreated, deep, into, russia, for, almost, three, months, the, nobility, pressured, alexander, to, relieve, the, commander, of, the, russian, army, field, marshal, barclay, de, tolly, alexander, complied, and, appointed, prince, mikhail, kutuzov, to, take, over, command, of, the, army, on, 7, september, the, grande, arm, e, faced, the, russian, army, at, a, small, village, called, borodino, 110, kilometres, 70, mi, west, of, moscow, the, battle, that, followed, was, the, largest, and, bloodiest, single, day, action, of, the, napoleonic, wars, involving, more, than, 250, 000, soldiers, and, resulting, in, 70, 000, casualties, the, outcome, of, the, battle, was, inconclusive, the, russian, army, undefeated, in, spite, of, heavy, losses, was, able, to, withdraw, the, following, day, leaving, the, french, without, the, decisive, victory, napoleon, sought, a, week, later, napoleon, entered, moscow, but, there, was, no, delegation, to, meet, the, emperor, the, russians, had, evacuated, the, city, and, the, city, s, governor, count, fyodor, rostopchin, ordered, several, strategic, points, in, moscow, to, be, set, ablaze, the, loss, of, moscow, did, not, compel, alexander, to, sue, for, peace, after, staying, in, the, city, for, a, month, napoleon, moved, his, army, out, southwest, toward, kaluga, where, kutuzov, was, encamped, with, the, russian, army, the, french, advance, toward, kaluga, was, checked, by, the, russian, army, and, napoleon, was, forced, to, retreat, to, the, areas, already, devastated, by, the, invasion, in, the, weeks, that, followed, the, grande, arm, e, starved, and, suffered, from, the, onset, of, the, russian, winter, lack, of, food, and, fodder, for, the, horses, and, persistent, attacks, upon, isolated, troops, from, russian, peasants, and, cossacks, led, to, great, losses, when, the, remnants, of, the, french, army, eventually, crossed, the, berezina, river, in, november, only, 27, 000, soldiers, remained, the, grande, arm, e, had, lost, some, 380, 000, men, dead, and, 100, 000, captured, following, the, crossing, of, the, berezina, napoleon, left, the, army, and, returned, to, paris, to, protect, his, position, as, emperor, and, to, raise, more, forces, to, resist, the, advancing, russians, the, campaign, ended, on, 14, december, 1812, with, the, last, french, troops, finally, leaving, russian, soil, the, campaign, was, a, turning, point, in, the, napoleonic, wars, napoleon, s, reputation, was, severely, shaken, and, french, hegemony, in, europe, was, weakened, the, grande, arm, e, made, up, of, french, and, allied, forces, was, reduced, to, a, fraction, of, its, initial, strength, these, events, triggered, a, major, shift, in, european, politics, france, s, ally, prussia, soon, followed, by, austria, broke, their, imposed, alliance, with, napoleon, and, switched, sides, triggering, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, with, the, russian, army, following, up, victory, over, napoleon, in, 1812, the, sixth, coalition, was, formed, with, russia, prussia, great, britain, sweden, spain, and, other, nations, although, the, french, were, victorious, in, the, initial, battles, during, the, campaign, in, germany, the, entry, of, austria, into, the, war, led, to, france, s, decisive, defeat, at, the, battle, of, leipzig, in, the, autumn, of, 1813, which, proved, to, be, a, massive, victory, for, the, coalition, following, the, battle, the, pro, french, confederation, of, the, rhine, collapsed, thereby, ending, napoleon, s, hold, on, territory, east, of, the, rhine, forever, alexander, being, the, supreme, commander, of, the, coalition, forces, in, the, theatre, and, the, paramount, monarch, among, the, three, main, coalition, monarchs, ordered, all, coalition, forces, in, germany, to, cross, the, rhine, and, invade, france, the, coalition, forces, divided, into, three, groups, entered, northeastern, france, in, january, 1814, facing, them, in, the, theatre, were, the, french, forces, numbering, only, about, 70, 000, men, in, spite, of, being, heavily, outnumbered, napoleon, defeated, the, divided, coalition, forces, in, the, battles, at, brienne, and, la, rothi, re, but, could, not, stop, the, coalition, s, advance, and, triumphant, victory, over, napoleon, austrian, emperor, francis, i, and, king, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, felt, demoralized, upon, hearing, about, napoleon, s, victories, since, the, start, of, the, campaign, they, even, considered, ordering, a, general, retreat, but, alexander, was, far, more, determined, than, ever, to, victoriously, enter, paris, whatever, the, cost, imposing, his, will, upon, karl, philipp, prince, of, schwarzenberg, and, the, wavering, monarchs, on, 28, march, coalition, forces, advanced, towards, paris, and, prepared, to, launch, an, assault, camping, outside, the, city, on, 29, march, the, coalition, armies, were, to, assault, the, city, from, its, northern, and, eastern, sides, the, next, morning, on, 30, march, the, battle, started, that, same, morning, with, intense, artillery, bombardment, from, the, coalition, positions, early, in, the, morning, the, coalition, attack, began, when, the, russians, attacked, and, drove, back, the, french, skirmishers, near, belleville, before, being, driven, back, themselves, by, french, cavalry, from, the, city, s, eastern, suburbs, by, 7, 00, a, m, the, russians, attacked, the, young, guard, near, romainville, in, the, centre, of, the, french, lines, and, after, some, time, and, hard, fighting, pushed, them, back, a, few, hours, later, the, prussians, under, gebhard, leberecht, von, bl, cher, attacked, north, of, the, city, and, carried, the, french, position, around, aubervilliers, but, did, not, press, their, attack, the, w, rttemberg, troops, seized, the, positions, at, saint, maur, to, the, southeast, with, austrian, troops, in, support, the, russian, forces, then, assailed, the, heights, of, montmartre, in, the, city, s, northeast, control, of, the, heights, was, severely, contested, until, the, french, forces, surrendered, alexander, sent, an, envoy, to, meet, with, the, french, to, hasten, the, surrender, he, offered, generous, terms, to, the, french, and, although, having, intended, to, avenge, moscow, he, declared, himself, to, be, bringing, peace, to, france, rather, than, its, destruction, on, 31, march, talleyrand, gave, the, key, of, the, city, to, the, tsar, later, that, day, the, coalition, armies, triumphantly, entered, the, city, with, alexander, at, the, head, of, the, army, followed, by, the, king, of, prussia, and, prince, schwarzenberg, until, this, battle, it, had, been, nearly, 400, years, since, a, foreign, army, had, entered, paris, during, the, hundred, years, war, on, 2, april, the, s, nat, conservateur, passed, the, acte, de, d, ch, ance, de, l, empereur, which, declared, napoleon, deposed, napoleon, was, in, fontainebleau, when, he, heard, that, paris, had, surrendered, outraged, he, wanted, to, march, on, the, capital, but, his, marshals, refused, to, fight, for, him, and, repeatedly, urged, him, to, surrender, he, abdicated, in, favour, of, his, son, on, 4, april, but, the, allies, rejected, this, out, of, hand, forcing, napoleon, to, abdicate, unconditionally, on, 6, april, the, terms, of, his, abdication, which, included, his, exile, to, the, isle, of, elba, were, settled, in, the, treaty, of, fontainebleau, on, 11, april, a, reluctant, napoleon, ratified, it, two, days, later, marking, the, end, of, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, alexander, tried, to, calm, the, unrest, of, his, conscience, by, correspondence, with, the, leaders, of, the, evangelical, revival, on, the, continent, and, sought, for, omens, and, supernatural, guidance, in, texts, and, passages, of, scripture, it, was, not, however, according, to, his, own, account, until, he, met, the, baroness, de, kr, dener, a, religious, adventuress, who, made, the, conversion, of, princes, her, special, mission, at, basel, in, the, autumn, of, 1813, that, his, soul, found, peace, from, this, time, a, mystic, pietism, became, the, avowed, force, of, his, political, as, of, his, private, actions, madame, de, kr, dener, and, her, colleague, the, evangelist, henri, louis, empaytaz, became, the, confidants, of, the, emperor, s, most, secret, thoughts, and, during, the, campaign, that, ended, in, the, occupation, of, paris, the, imperial, prayer, meetings, were, the, oracle, on, whose, revelations, hung, the, fate, of, the, world, such, was, alexander, s, mood, when, the, downfall, of, napoleon, left, him, one, of, the, most, powerful, sovereigns, in, europe, with, the, memory, of, the, treaty, of, tilsit, still, fresh, in, men, s, minds, it, was, not, unnatural, that, to, cynical, men, of, the, world, like, klemens, wenzel, von, metternich, he, merely, seemed, to, be, disguising, under, the, language, of, evangelical, abnegation, vast, and, perilous, schemes, of, ambition, the, puzzled, powers, were, in, fact, the, more, inclined, to, be, suspicious, in, view, of, other, and, seemingly, inconsistent, tendencies, of, the, emperor, which, yet, seemed, all, to, point, to, a, like, disquieting, conclusion, for, madame, de, kr, dener, was, not, the, only, influence, behind, the, throne, and, though, alexander, had, declared, war, against, the, revolution, la, harpe, his, erstwhile, tutor, was, once, more, at, his, elbow, and, the, catchwords, of, the, gospel, of, humanity, were, still, on, his, lips, the, very, proclamations, which, denounced, napoleon, as, the, genius, of, evil, denounced, him, in, the, name, of, liberty, and, of, enlightenment, conservatives, suspected, alexander, of, a, monstrous, intrigue, by, which, the, eastern, autocrat, would, ally, with, the, jacobinism, of, all, europe, aiming, at, an, all, powerful, russia, in, place, of, an, all, powerful, france, at, the, congress, of, vienna, alexander, s, attitude, accentuated, this, distrust, robert, stewart, viscount, castlereagh, whose, single, minded, aim, was, the, restoration, of, a, just, equilibrium, in, europe, reproached, the, tsar, to, his, face, for, a, conscience, which, led, him, to, imperil, the, concert, of, the, powers, by, keeping, his, hold, on, poland, in, violation, of, his, treaty, obligation, once, a, supporter, of, limited, liberalism, as, seen, in, his, approval, of, the, representative, institutions, in, the, ionian, islands, grand, duchy, of, finland, and, the, constitution, of, the, kingdom, of, poland, in, 1815, from, the, end, of, the, year, 1818, alexander, s, views, began, to, change, a, revolutionary, conspiracy, among, the, officers, of, the, russian, imperial, guard, and, a, plot, to, kidnap, him, on, his, way, to, the, congress, of, aix, la, chapelle, are, said, to, have, shaken, his, liberal, beliefs, at, aix, he, came, for, the, first, time, into, intimate, contact, with, metternich, from, this, time, dates, the, ascendancy, of, metternich, over, the, mind, of, the, russian, emperor, and, in, the, councils, of, europe, it, was, however, no, case, of, sudden, conversion, though, alarmed, by, the, revolutionary, agitation, in, germany, which, culminated, in, the, murder, of, his, agent, the, dramatist, august, von, kotzebue, 23, march, 1819, alexander, joined, castlereagh, s, protest, against, metternich, s, collective, security, policy, of, the, governments, contracting, an, alliance, against, the, peoples, as, formulated, in, the, carlsbad, decrees, of, july, 1819, alexander, deprecated, any, intervention, of, a, european, league, in, the, affairs, of, individucal, nations, to, support, the, absurd, pretensions, of, absolute, power, he, still, declared, his, belief, in, free, institutions, with, limitations, liberty, he, maintained, should, be, confined, within, just, limits, and, the, limits, of, liberty, are, the, principles, of, order, alexander, s, conversion, was, completed, by, the, 1820, revolutions, in, naples, and, piedmont, combined, with, increasingly, disquieting, symptoms, of, discontent, in, france, germany, and, among, his, own, people, in, the, seclusion, of, the, little, town, of, troppau, where, in, october, 1820, the, powers, met, in, conference, metternich, cemented, his, influence, over, alexander, which, had, been, wanting, amid, the, turmoil, and, intrigues, of, vienna, and, aix, during, a, friendly, conversation, over, afternoon, tea, the, disillusioned, autocrat, confessed, his, mistake, you, have, nothing, to, regret, he, said, sadly, to, the, exultant, chancellor, but, i, have, the, issue, was, momentous, in, january, alexander, had, still, upheld, the, ideal, of, a, free, confederation, of, the, european, states, the, holy, alliance, against, the, policy, of, a, dictatorship, of, the, great, powers, the, quadruple, treaty, he, gave, in, on, 19, november, by, signing, the, troppau, protocol, which, consecrated, the, claims, of, collective, europe, to, interfere, in, the, internal, concerns, of, the, sovereign, states, at, the, congress, of, laibach, which, had, been, adjourned, in, the, spring, of, 1821, alexander, received, news, of, the, greek, revolt, against, the, ottoman, empire, from, this, time, until, his, death, alexander, s, mind, was, torn, between, his, dreams, of, a, stable, confederation, of, europe, and, his, traditional, mission, as, leader, of, the, orthodox, crusade, against, the, ottomans, at, first, under, the, careful, advice, of, metternich, alexander, chose, the, former, siding, against, the, greek, revolt, for, the, sake, of, stability, in, the, region, alexander, expelled, its, leader, alexander, ypsilantis, from, the, russian, imperial, cavalry, and, directed, his, foreign, minister, ioannis, kapodistrias, known, as, giovanni, count, capo, d, istria, himself, a, greek, to, disavow, any, russian, sympathy, with, ypsilantis, and, in, 1822, he, issued, orders, that, a, deputation, from, the, greek, morea, province, to, the, congress, of, verona, be, turned, back, on, the, road, he, made, some, effort, to, reconcile, his, loyalties, the, ottoman, sultan, mahmud, ii, had, been, excluded, from, the, holy, alliance, under, the, principle, that, the, affairs, of, the, east, were, the, domestic, concerns, of, russia, rather, than, of, the, concert, of, europe, but, alexander, now, offered, to, surrender, this, claim, and, act, in, the, east, as, the, mandatory, of, europe, as, austria, had, acted, in, naples, and, so, march, as, a, christian, liberator, into, the, ottoman, empire, metternich, opposed, this, putting, the, austrian, led, balance, of, power, including, the, ottoman, empire, above, the, interests, of, christendom, this, opened, alexander, s, eyes, to, the, austria, s, true, attitude, towards, his, ideals, back, in, russia, far, from, the, fascination, of, metternich, s, personality, he, was, once, again, moved, by, the, aspirations, of, his, people, and, russian, policy, swung, toward, the, greek, cause, in, 1823, the, 1817, 1824, cholera, pandemic, reached, astrakhan, and, the, tsar, ordered, an, anti, cholera, campaign, that, was, imitated, in, other, countries, on, 9, october, 1793, alexander, married, louise, of, baden, known, as, elizabeth, alexeievna, after, her, conversion, to, the, orthodox, church, he, later, told, his, friend, frederick, william, iii, that, the, marriage, a, political, match, devised, by, his, grandmother, catherine, the, great, regrettably, proved, to, be, a, misfortune, for, him, and, his, spouse, their, two, children, died, young, though, their, common, sorrow, drew, the, spouses, closer, together, after, a, relationship, with, his, mistress, maria, naryshkina, from, 1799, until, 1818, alexander, suffered, the, death, of, their, beloved, daughter, sophia, naryshkina, and, the, empress, generous, sympathy, for, his, grief, strengthened, their, marital, bond, in, 1809, he, was, widely, rumoured, to, have, had, an, affair, with, the, finnish, noblewoman, ulla, m, llersv, rd, and, to, have, had, a, child, by, her, but, this, is, not, confirmed, with, his, mind, deteriorating, alexander, grew, increasingly, suspicious, withdrawn, and, religious, and, less, active, some, historians, conclude, his, profile, coincides, precisely, with, the, schizophrenic, prototype, a, withdrawn, seclusive, rather, shy, introvertive, unaggressive, and, somewhat, apathetic, individual, in, the, autumn, of, 1825, the, emperor, undertook, a, voyage, to, the, south, of, russia, due, to, the, increasing, illness, of, his, wife, during, his, trip, he, himself, caught, typhus, from, which, he, died, in, the, southern, city, of, taganrog, on, 19, november, 1825, old, style, however, news, of, his, death, did, not, reach, the, capital, until, december, his, two, brothers, disputed, who, would, become, tsar, each, wanted, the, other, to, do, so, his, wife, died, a, few, months, later, as, the, emperor, s, body, was, transported, to, saint, petersburg, for, the, funeral, he, was, interred, at, the, saints, peter, and, paul, cathedral, of, the, peter, and, paul, fortress, in, saint, petersburg, on, 13, march, 1826, a, popular, legend, has, it, that, tsar, alexander, faked, his, death, and, lived, as, a, hermit, under, the, name, feodor, kuzmich, a, theory, often, resurrected, by, popular, writers, the, theory, involves, the, curious, similarities, between, alexander, and, kuzmich, svetlana, semyonova, president, of, the, russian, graphological, society, judged, alexander, s, and, kuzmich, s, handwriting, to, be, identical, the, priest, attending, feodor, kuzmich, on, his, deathbed, reportedly, asked, him, if, he, was, in, fact, alexander, the, blessed, in, response, kuzmich, said, your, works, are, wonderful, lord, there, is, no, secret, which, is, not, opened, alexander, s, letters, to, his, grandfather, frederick, ii, eugene, duke, of, w, rttemberg, together, with, letters, from, his, siblings, written, between, 1795, and, 1797, are, preserved, in, the, state, archive, of, stuttgart, hauptstaatsarchiv, stuttgart, in, stuttgart, germany, he, received, the, following, orders, and, decorations,
