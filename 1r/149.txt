was, a, moody, child, prone, to, fits, of, temper, and, insolence, and, he, often, drifted, into, periods, of, laziness, after, bouts, of, illness, his, parents, discovered, that, drawing, often, settled, him, down, and, helped, focus, his, attention, the, family, moved, from, lowell, to, stonington, connecticut, in, 1837, where, his, father, worked, for, the, stonington, railroad, three, of,

st, petersburg, to, join, him, in, the, winter, of, 1842, 43, after, moving, to, st, petersburg, the, young, whistler, took, private, art, lessons, then, enrolled, in, the, imperial, academy, of, arts, at, age, eleven, the, young, artist, followed, the, traditional, curriculum, of, drawing, from, plaster, casts, and, occasional, live, models, revelled, in, the, atmosphere, of, art, talk, with, older, peers, and, pleased, his, parents, with, a, first, class, mark, in, anatomy, in, 1844, he, met, the, noted, artist, sir, william, allan, who, came, to, russia, with, a, commission, to, paint, a, history, of, the, life, of, peter, the, great, whistler, s, mother, noted, in, her, diary, the, great, artist, remarked, to, me, your, little, boy, has, uncommon, genius, but, do, not, urge, him, beyond, his, inclination, in, 1847, 1848, his, family, spent, some, time, in, london, with, relatives, while, his, father, stayed, in, russia, whistler, s, brother, in, law, francis, haden, a, physician, who, was, also, an, artist, spurred, his, interest, in, art, and, photography, haden, took, whistler, to, visit, collectors, and, to, lectures, and, gave, him, a, watercolour, set, with, instruction, whistler, already, was, imagining, an, art, career, he, began, to, collect, books, on, art, and, he, studied, other, artists, techniques, when, his, portrait, was, painted, by, sir, william, boxall, in, 1848, the, young, whistler, exclaimed, that, the, portrait, was, very, much, like, me, and, a, very, fine, picture, mr, boxall, is, a, beautiful, colourist, it, is, a, beautiful, creamy, surface, and, looks, so, rich, in, his, blossoming, enthusiasm, for, art, at, fifteen, he, informed, his, father, by, letter, of, his, future, direction, i, hope, dear, father, you, will, not, object, to, my, choice, his, father, however, died, from, cholera, at, the, age, of, 49, and, the, whistler, family, moved, back, to, his, mother, s, home, town, of, pomfret, connecticut, the, family, lived, frugally, and, managed, to, get, by, on, a, limited, income, his, art, plans, remained, vague, and, his, future, uncertain, his, cousin, reported, that, whistler, at, that, time, was, slight, with, a, pensive, delicate, face, shaded, by, soft, brown, curls, he, had, a, somewhat, foreign, appearance, and, manner, which, aided, by, natural, abilities, made, him, very, charming, even, at, that, age, whistler, was, sent, to, christ, church, hall, school, with, his, mother, s, hopes, that, he, would, become, a, minister, whistler, was, seldom, without, his, sketchbook, and, was, popular, with, his, classmates, for, his, caricatures, however, it, became, clear, that, a, career, in, religion, did, not, suit, him, so, he, applied, to, the, united, states, military, academy, at, west, point, where, his, father, had, taught, drawing, and, other, relatives, had, attended, he, was, admitted, to, the, highly, selective, institution, in, july, 1851, on, the, strength, of, his, family, name, despite, his, extreme, nearsightedness, and, poor, health, history, however, during, his, three, years, there, his, grades, were, barely, satisfactory, and, he, was, a, sorry, sight, at, drill, and, dress, known, as, curly, for, his, hair, length, which, exceeded, regulations, whistler, bucked, authority, spouted, sarcastic, comments, and, racked, up, demerits, colonel, robert, e, lee, was, the, west, point, superintendent, and, after, considerable, indulgence, toward, whistler, he, had, no, choice, but, to, dismiss, the, young, cadet, whistler, s, major, accomplishment, at, west, point, was, learning, drawing, and, map, making, from, american, artist, robert, w, weir, his, departure, from, west, point, seems, to, have, been, precipitated, by, a, failure, in, a, chemistry, exam, where, he, was, asked, to, describe, silicon, and, began, by, saying, silicon, is, a, gas, as, he, himself, put, it, later, if, silicon, were, a, gas, i, would, have, been, a, general, one, day, however, a, separate, anecdote, suggests, misconduct, in, drawing, class, as, the, reason, for, whistler, s, departure, after, west, point, whistler, worked, as, draftsman, mapping, the, entire, u, s, coast, for, military, and, maritime, purposes, he, found, the, work, boring, and, he, was, frequently, late, or, absent, he, spent, much, of, his, free, time, playing, billiards, and, idling, about, was, always, broke, and, although, a, charmer, had, little, acquaintance, with, women, after, it, was, discovered, that, he, was, drawing, sea, serpents, mermaids, and, whales, on, the, margins, of, the, maps, he, was, transferred, to, the, etching, division, of, the, united, states, coast, survey, he, lasted, there, only, two, months, but, he, learned, the, etching, technique, which, later, proved, valuable, to, his, career, at, this, point, whistler, firmly, decided, that, art, would, be, his, future, for, a, few, months, he, lived, in, baltimore, with, a, wealthy, friend, tom, winans, who, even, furnished, whistler, with, a, studio, and, some, spending, cash, the, young, artist, made, some, valuable, contacts, in, the, art, community, and, also, sold, some, early, paintings, to, winans, whistler, turned, down, his, mother, s, suggestions, for, other, more, practical, careers, and, informed, her, that, with, money, from, winans, he, was, setting, out, to, further, his, art, training, in, paris, whistler, never, returned, to, the, united, states, whistler, arrived, in, paris, in, 1855, rented, a, studio, in, the, latin, quarter, and, quickly, adopted, the, life, of, a, bohemian, artist, soon, he, had, a, french, girlfriend, a, dressmaker, named, h, loise, he, studied, traditional, art, methods, for, a, short, time, at, the, ecole, imp, riale, and, at, the, atelier, of, charles, gleyre, the, latter, was, a, great, advocate, of, the, work, of, ingres, and, impressed, whistler, with, two, principles, that, he, used, for, the, rest, of, his, career, that, line, is, more, important, than, color, and, that, black, is, the, fundamental, color, of, tonal, harmony, twenty, years, later, the, impressionists, would, largely, overthrow, this, philosophy, banning, black, and, brown, as, forbidden, colors, and, emphasizing, color, over, form, whistler, preferred, self, study, and, enjoying, the, caf, life, while, letters, from, home, reported, his, mother, s, efforts, at, economy, whistler, spent, freely, sold, little, or, nothing, in, his, first, year, in, paris, and, was, in, steady, debt, to, relieve, the, situation, he, took, to, painting, and, selling, copies, from, works, at, the, louvre, and, finally, moved, to, cheaper, quarters, as, luck, would, have, it, the, arrival, in, paris, of, george, lucas, another, rich, friend, helped, stabilize, whistler, s, finances, for, a, while, in, spite, of, a, financial, respite, the, winter, of, 1857, was, a, difficult, one, for, whistler, his, poor, health, made, worse, by, excessive, smoking, and, drinking, laid, him, low, conditions, improved, during, the, summer, of, 1858, whistler, recovered, and, traveled, with, fellow, artist, ernest, delannoy, through, france, and, the, rhineland, he, later, produced, a, group, of, etchings, known, as, the, french, set, with, the, help, of, french, master, printer, auguste, del, tre, during, that, year, he, painted, his, first, self, portrait, portrait, of, whistler, with, hat, a, dark, and, thickly, rendered, work, reminiscent, of, rembrandt, but, the, event, of, greatest, consequence, that, year, was, his, friendship, with, henri, fantin, latour, whom, he, met, at, the, louvre, through, him, whistler, was, introduced, to, the, circle, of, gustave, courbet, which, included, carolus, duran, later, the, teacher, of, john, singer, sargent, alphonse, legros, and, douard, manet, also, in, this, group, was, charles, baudelaire, whose, ideas, and, theories, of, modern, art, influenced, whistler, baudelaire, challenged, artists, to, scrutinize, the, brutality, of, life, and, nature, and, to, portray, it, faithfully, avoiding, the, old, themes, of, mythology, and, allegory, th, ophile, gautier, one, of, the, first, to, explore, translation, qualities, among, art, and, music, may, have, inspired, whistler, to, view, art, in, musical, terms, reflecting, his, adopted, circle, s, banner, of, the, realism, art, movement, whistler, painted, his, first, exhibited, work, la, m, re, g, rard, in, 1858, he, followed, it, by, painting, at, the, piano, in, 1859, in, london, which, he, adopted, as, his, home, while, also, regularly, visiting, friends, in, france, at, the, piano, is, a, portrait, composed, of, his, niece, and, her, mother, in, their, london, music, room, an, effort, which, clearly, displayed, his, talent, and, promise, a, critic, wrote, a, recklessly, bold, manner, and, sketchiness, of, the, wildest, and, roughest, kind, a, genuine, feeling, for, colour, and, a, splendid, power, of, composition, and, design, which, evince, a, just, appreciation, of, nature, very, rare, amongst, artists, the, work, is, unsentimental, and, effectively, contrasts, the, mother, in, black, and, the, daughter, in, white, with, other, colors, kept, restrained, in, the, manner, advised, by, his, teacher, gleyre, it, was, displayed, at, the, royal, academy, the, following, year, and, in, many, exhibits, to, come, in, a, second, painting, executed, in, the, same, room, whistler, demonstrated, his, natural, inclination, toward, innovation, and, novelty, by, fashioning, a, genre, scene, with, unusual, composition, and, foreshortening, it, later, was, re, titled, harmony, in, green, and, rose, the, music, room, this, painting, also, demonstrated, whistler, s, ongoing, work, pattern, especially, with, portraits, a, quick, start, major, adjustments, a, period, of, neglect, then, a, final, flurry, to, the, finish, after, a, year, in, london, he, produced, a, set, of, etchings, in, 1860, called, thames, set, as, counterpoint, to, his, 1858, french, set, as, well, as, some, early, impressionistic, work, including, the, thames, in, ice, at, this, stage, he, was, beginning, to, establish, his, technique, of, tonal, harmony, based, on, a, limited, predetermined, palette, in, 1861, after, returning, to, paris, for, a, time, whistler, painted, his, first, famous, work, symphony, in, white, no, 1, the, white, girl, the, portrait, of, his, mistress, and, business, manager, joanna, hiffernan, was, created, as, a, simple, study, in, white, however, others, saw, it, differently, the, critic, jules, antoine, castagnary, thought, the, painting, an, allegory, of, a, new, bride, s, lost, innocence, others, linked, it, to, wilkie, collins, s, the, woman, in, white, a, popular, novel, of, the, time, or, various, other, literary, sources, in, england, some, considered, it, a, painting, in, the, pre, raphaelite, manner, in, the, painting, hiffernan, holds, a, lily, in, her, left, hand, and, stands, upon, a, wolf, skin, rug, interpreted, by, some, to, represent, masculinity, and, lust, with, the, wolf, s, head, staring, menacingly, at, the, viewer, the, portrait, was, refused, for, exhibition, at, the, conservative, royal, academy, but, was, shown, in, a, private, gallery, under, the, title, the, woman, in, white, in, 1863, it, was, shown, at, the, salon, des, refus, s, in, paris, an, event, sponsored, by, emperor, napoleon, iii, for, the, exhibition, of, works, rejected, from, the, salon, whistler, s, painting, was, widely, noticed, although, upstaged, by, manet, s, more, shocking, painting, le, d, jeuner, sur, l, herbe, countering, criticism, by, traditionalists, whistler, s, supporters, insisted, that, the, painting, was, an, apparition, with, a, spiritual, content, and, that, it, epitomized, his, theory, that, art, should, be, concerned, essentially, with, the, arrangement, of, colors, in, harmony, not, with, a, literal, portrayal, of, the, natural, world, two, years, later, whistler, painted, another, portrait, of, hiffernan, in, white, this, time, displaying, his, newfound, interest, in, asian, motifs, which, he, entitled, the, little, white, girl, his, lady, of, the, land, lijsen, and, the, golden, screen, both, completed, in, 1864, again, portray, his, mistress, in, even, more, emphatic, asian, dress, and, surroundings, during, this, period, whistler, became, close, to, gustave, courbet, the, early, leader, of, the, french, realist, school, but, when, hiffernan, modeled, in, the, nude, for, courbet, whistler, became, enraged, and, his, relationship, with, hiffernan, began, to, fall, apart, in, january, 1864, whistler, s, very, religious, and, very, proper, mother, arrived, in, london, upsetting, her, son, s, bohemian, existence, and, temporarily, exacerbating, family, tensions, as, he, wrote, to, henri, fantin, latour, general, upheaval, i, had, to, empty, my, house, and, purify, it, from, cellar, to, eaves, he, also, immediately, moved, hiffernan, to, another, location, from, 1866, whistler, made, his, home, in, chelsea, london, an, area, popular, with, artists, firstly, in, cheyne, walk, then, an, ill, fated, move, to, tite, street, and, finally, upper, church, street, in, 1866, whistler, decided, to, visit, valpara, so, chile, a, journey, that, has, puzzled, scholars, although, whistler, stated, that, he, did, it, for, political, reasons, chile, was, at, war, with, spain, and, perhaps, whistler, thought, it, a, heroic, struggle, of, a, small, nation, against, a, larger, one, but, no, evidence, supports, that, theory, what, the, journey, did, produce, was, whistler, s, first, three, nocturnal, paintings, which, he, originally, termed, moonlights, night, scenes, of, the, harbor, painted, with, a, blue, or, light, green, palette, after, he, returned, to, london, he, painted, several, more, nocturnes, over, the, next, ten, years, many, of, the, river, thames, and, of, cremorne, gardens, a, pleasure, park, famous, for, its, frequent, fireworks, displays, which, presented, a, novel, challenge, to, paint, in, his, maritime, nocturnes, whistler, used, highly, thinned, paint, as, a, ground, with, lightly, flicked, color, to, suggest, ships, lights, and, shore, line, some, of, the, thames, paintings, also, show, compositional, and, thematic, similarities, with, the, japanese, prints, of, hiroshige, in, 1872, whistler, credited, his, patron, frederick, leyland, an, amateur, musician, devoted, to, chopin, for, his, musically, inspired, titles, i, say, i, can, t, thank, you, too, much, for, the, name, nocturne, as, a, title, for, my, moonlights, you, have, no, idea, what, an, irritation, it, proves, to, the, critics, and, consequent, pleasure, to, me, besides, it, is, really, so, charming, and, does, so, poetically, say, all, that, i, want, to, say, and, no, more, than, i, wish, at, that, point, whistler, painted, another, self, portrait, and, entitled, it, arrangement, in, gray, portrait, of, the, painter, c, 1872, and, he, also, began, to, re, title, many, of, his, earlier, works, using, terms, associated, with, music, such, as, a, nocturne, symphony, harmony, study, or, arrangement, to, emphasize, the, tonal, qualities, and, the, composition, and, to, de, emphasize, the, narrative, content, whistler, s, nocturnes, were, among, his, most, innovative, works, furthermore, his, submission, of, several, nocturnes, to, art, dealer, paul, durand, ruel, after, the, franco, prussian, war, gave, whistler, the, opportunity, to, explain, his, evolving, theory, in, art, to, artists, buyers, and, critics, in, france, his, good, friend, fantin, latour, growing, more, reactionary, in, his, opinions, especially, in, his, negativity, concerning, the, emerging, impressionist, school, found, whistler, s, new, works, surprising, and, confounding, fantin, latour, admitted, i, don, t, understand, anything, there, it, s, bizarre, how, one, changes, i, don, t, recognize, him, anymore, their, relationship, was, nearly, at, an, end, by, then, but, they, continued, to, share, opinions, in, occasional, correspondence, when, edgar, degas, invited, whistler, to, exhibit, with, the, first, show, by, the, impressionists, in, 1874, whistler, turned, down, the, invitation, as, did, manet, and, some, scholars, attributed, this, in, part, to, fantin, latour, s, influence, on, both, men, the, franco, prussian, war, of, 1870, fragmented, the, french, art, community, many, artists, took, refuge, in, england, joining, whistler, including, camille, pissarro, and, claude, monet, while, manet, and, degas, stayed, in, france, like, whistler, monet, and, pissarro, both, focused, their, efforts, on, views, of, the, city, and, it, is, likely, that, whistler, was, exposed, to, the, evolution, of, impressionism, founded, by, these, artists, and, that, they, had, seen, his, nocturnes, whistler, was, drifting, away, from, courbet, s, damned, realism, and, their, friendship, had, wilted, as, had, his, liaison, with, joanna, hiffernan, by, 1871, whistler, returned, to, portraits, and, soon, produced, his, most, famous, painting, the, nearly, monochromatic, full, length, figure, entitled, arrangement, in, grey, and, black, no, 1, but, usually, referred, to, as, whistler, s, mother, a, model, failed, to, appear, one, day, according, to, a, letter, from, his, mother, so, whistler, turned, to, his, mother, and, suggested, that, he, do, her, portrait, he, had, her, stand, at, first, in, his, typically, slow, and, experimental, way, but, that, proved, too, tiring, so, the, seated, pose, was, adopted, it, took, dozens, of, sittings, to, complete, the, austere, portrait, in, his, normally, constrained, palette, is, another, whistler, exercise, in, tonal, harmony, and, composition, the, deceptively, simple, design, is, in, fact, a, balancing, act, of, differing, shapes, particularly, the, rectangles, of, curtain, picture, on, the, wall, and, floor, which, stabilize, the, curve, of, her, face, dress, and, chair, whistler, commented, that, the, painting, s, narrative, was, of, little, importance, yet, the, painting, was, also, paying, homage, to, his, pious, mother, after, the, initial, shock, of, her, moving, in, with, her, son, she, aided, him, considerably, by, stabilizing, his, behavior, somewhat, tending, to, his, domestic, needs, and, providing, an, aura, of, conservative, respectability, that, helped, win, over, patrons, the, public, reacted, negatively, to, the, painting, mostly, because, of, its, anti, victorian, simplicity, during, a, time, in, england, when, sentimentality, and, flamboyant, decoration, were, in, vogue, critics, thought, the, painting, a, failed, experiment, rather, than, a, work, of, art, the, royal, academy, rejected, it, but, then, grudgingly, accepted, it, after, lobbying, by, sir, william, boxall, but, they, hung, it, in, an, unfavorable, location, at, their, exhibition, from, the, start, whistler, s, mother, sparked, varying, reactions, including, parody, ridicule, and, reverence, which, have, continued, to, today, some, saw, it, as, the, dignified, feeling, of, old, ladyhood, a, grave, sentiment, of, mourning, or, a, perfect, symbol, of, motherhood, others, employed, it, as, a, fitting, vehicle, for, mockery, it, has, been, satirized, in, endless, variations, in, greeting, cards, and, magazines, and, by, cartoon, characters, such, as, donald, duck, and, bullwinkle, the, moose, whistler, did, his, part, in, promoting, the, picture, and, popularizing, the, image, he, frequently, exhibited, it, and, authorized, the, early, reproductions, that, made, their, way, into, thousands, of, homes, the, painting, narrowly, escaped, being, burned, in, a, fire, aboard, a, train, during, shipping, it, was, ultimately, purchased, by, the, french, government, the, first, whistler, work, in, a, public, collection, and, is, now, housed, in, the, mus, e, d, orsay, in, paris, during, the, great, depression, in, the, united, states, the, picture, was, billed, as, a, million, dollar, painting, and, was, a, big, hit, at, the, 1933, 34, chicago, world, s, fair, it, was, accepted, as, a, universal, icon, of, motherhood, by, the, worldwide, public, which, was, not, particularly, aware, of, or, concerned, with, whistler, s, aesthetic, theories, in, recognition, of, its, status, and, popularity, the, united, states, issued, a, postage, stamp, in, 1934, featuring, an, adaptation, of, the, painting, in, 2015, new, yorker, critic, peter, schjeldahl, wrote, that, it, remains, the, most, important, american, work, residing, outside, the, united, states, martha, tedeschi, writes, whistler, s, mother, wood, s, american, gothic, leonardo, da, vinci, s, mona, lisa, and, edvard, munch, s, the, scream, have, all, achieved, something, that, most, paintings, regardless, of, their, art, historical, importance, beauty, or, monetary, value, have, not, they, communicate, a, specific, meaning, almost, immediately, to, almost, every, viewer, these, few, works, have, successfully, made, the, transition, from, the, elite, realm, of, the, museum, visitor, to, the, enormous, venue, of, popular, culture, other, important, portraits, by, whistler, include, those, of, thomas, carlyle, historian, 1873, maud, franklin, his, mistress, 1876, cicely, alexander, daughter, of, a, london, banker, 1873, lady, meux, socialite, 1882, and, th, odore, duret, critic, 1884, in, the, 1870s, whistler, painted, full, length, portraits, of, his, benefactor, frederick, leyland, and, his, wife, frances, leyland, subsequently, commissioned, the, artist, to, decorate, his, dining, room, see, peacock, room, below, whistler, had, been, disappointed, over, the, irregular, acceptance, of, his, works, for, the, royal, academy, exhibitions, and, the, poor, hanging, and, placement, of, his, paintings, in, response, whistler, staged, his, first, solo, show, in, 1874, the, show, was, notable, and, noticed, however, for, whistler, s, design, and, decoration, of, the, hall, which, harmonized, well, with, the, paintings, in, keeping, with, his, art, theories, a, reviewer, wrote, the, visitor, is, struck, on, entering, the, gallery, with, a, curious, sense, of, harmony, and, fitness, pervading, it, and, is, more, interested, perhaps, in, the, general, effect, than, in, any, one, work, whistler, was, not, so, successful, a, portrait, painter, as, the, other, famous, expatriate, american, john, singer, sargent, whistler, s, spare, technique, and, his, disinclination, to, flatter, his, sitters, as, well, as, his, notoriety, may, account, for, this, he, also, worked, very, slowly, and, demanded, extraordinarily, long, sittings, william, merritt, chase, complained, of, his, sitting, for, a, portrait, by, whistler, he, proved, to, be, a, veritable, tyrant, painting, every, day, into, the, twilight, while, my, limbs, ached, with, weariness, and, my, head, swam, dizzily, don, t, move, don, t, move, he, would, scream, whenever, i, started, to, rest, by, the, time, he, gained, widespread, acceptance, in, the, 1890s, whistler, was, past, his, prime, as, a, portrait, painter, whistler, s, approach, to, portraiture, in, his, late, maturity, was, described, by, one, of, his, sitters, arthur, j, eddy, who, posed, for, the, artist, in, 1894, he, worked, with, great, rapidity, and, long, hours, but, he, used, his, colours, thin, and, covered, the, canvas, with, innumerable, coats, of, paint, the, colours, increased, in, depth, and, intensity, as, the, work, progressed, at, first, the, entire, figure, was, painted, in, greyish, brown, tones, with, very, little, flesh, colour, the, whole, blending, perfectly, with, the, greyish, brown, of, the, prepared, canvas, then, the, entire, background, would, be, intensified, a, little, then, the, figure, made, a, little, stronger, then, the, background, and, so, on, from, day, to, day, and, week, to, week, and, often, from, month, to, month, and, so, the, portrait, would, really, grow, really, develop, as, an, entirety, very, much, as, a, negative, under, the, action, of, the, chemicals, comes, out, gradually, light, shadows, and, all, from, the, very, first, faint, indications, to, their, full, values, it, was, as, if, the, portrait, were, hidden, within, the, canvas, and, the, master, by, passing, his, wands, day, after, day, over, the, surface, evoked, the, image, whistler, produced, numerous, etchings, lithographs, and, dry, points, his, lithographs, some, drawn, on, stone, others, drawn, directly, on, lithographie, paper, are, perhaps, half, as, numerous, as, his, etchings, some, of, the, lithographs, are, of, figures, slightly, draped, two, or, three, of, the, very, finest, are, of, thames, subjects, including, a, nocturne, at, limehouse, while, others, depict, the, faubourg, saint, germain, in, paris, and, georgian, churches, in, soho, and, bloomsbury, in, london, the, etchings, include, portraits, of, family, mistresses, and, intimate, street, scenes, in, london, and, venice, whistler, gained, an, enormous, reputation, as, an, etcher, martin, hardie, wrote, there, are, some, who, set, him, beside, rembrandt, perhaps, above, rembrandt, as, the, greatest, master, of, all, time, personally, i, prefer, to, regard, them, as, the, jupiter, and, venus, largest, and, brightest, among, the, planets, in, the, etcher, s, heaven, he, took, great, care, over, the, printing, of, his, etchings, and, the, choice, of, paper, at, the, beginning, and, end, of, his, career, he, placed, great, emphasis, on, cleanness, of, line, though, in, a, middle, period, he, experimented, more, with, inking, and, the, use, of, surface, tone, whistler, s, famous, butterfly, signature, first, developed, in, the, 1860s, out, of, his, interest, in, asian, art, he, studied, the, potter, s, marks, on, the, china, he, had, begun, to, collect, and, decided, to, design, a, monogram, of, his, initials, over, time, this, evolved, into, the, shape, of, an, abstract, butterfly, by, around, 1880, he, added, a, stinger, to, the, butterfly, image, to, create, a, mark, representing, both, his, gentle, sensitive, nature, and, his, provocative, feisty, spirit, he, took, great, care, in, the, appropriate, placement, of, the, image, on, both, his, paintings, and, his, custom, made, frames, his, focus, on, the, importance, of, balance, and, harmony, extended, beyond, the, frame, to, the, placement, of, his, paintings, to, their, settings, and, further, to, the, design, of, an, entire, architectural, element, as, in, the, peacock, room, harmony, in, blue, and, gold, the, peacock, room, is, whistler, s, masterpiece, of, interior, decorative, mural, art, painted, in, 1876, 1877, it, is, now, considered, a, high, example, of, the, anglo, japanese, style, frederick, leyland, left, the, room, in, whistler, s, care, to, make, minor, changes, to, harmonize, the, room, whose, primary, purpose, was, to, display, leyland, s, china, collection, he, painted, over, the, original, paneled, room, designed, by, thomas, jeckyll, 1827, 1881, in, a, unified, palette, of, brilliant, blue, greens, with, over, glazing, and, metallic, gold, leaf, whistler, let, his, imagination, run, wild, however, well, you, know, i, just, painted, on, i, went, on, without, design, or, sketch, putting, in, every, touch, with, such, freedom, and, the, harmony, in, blue, and, gold, developing, you, know, i, forgot, everything, in, my, joy, of, it, he, completely, painted, over, 16th, century, cordoba, leather, wall, coverings, first, brought, to, britain, by, catherine, of, aragon, that, leyland, had, paid, 1, 000, for, having, acquired, the, centerpiece, of, the, room, whistler, s, painting, of, the, princess, from, the, land, of, porcelain, american, industrialist, and, aesthete, charles, lang, freer, purchased, the, entire, room, in, 1904, from, leyland, s, heirs, including, leyland, s, daughter, and, her, husband, the, british, artist, val, prinsep, freer, then, had, the, contents, of, the, peacock, room, installed, in, his, detroit, mansion, after, freer, s, death, in, 1919, the, peacock, room, was, permanently, installed, in, the, freer, gallery, of, art, at, the, smithsonian, in, washington, d, c, the, gallery, opened, to, the, public, in, 1923, a, large, painted, caricature, by, whistler, of, leyland, portraying, him, as, an, anthropomorphic, peacock, playing, a, piano, and, entitled, the, gold, scab, eruption, in, frilthy, lucre, a, pun, on, leyland, s, miserliness, and, fondness, for, frilly, shirt, fronts, is, in, the, permanent, collection, of, the, fine, arts, museums, of, san, francisco, in, 1877, whistler, sued, the, critic, john, ruskin, after, the, critic, condemned, his, painting, nocturne, in, black, and, gold, the, falling, rocket, whistler, exhibited, the, work, in, the, grosvenor, gallery, an, alternative, to, the, royal, academy, exhibition, alongside, works, by, edward, burne, jones, and, other, artists, ruskin, who, had, been, a, champion, of, the, pre, raphaelites, and, j, m, w, turner, reviewed, whistler, s, work, in, his, publication, fors, clavigera, on, july, 2, 1877, ruskin, praised, burne, jones, while, he, attacked, whistler, for, mr, whistler, s, own, sake, no, less, than, for, the, protection, of, the, purchaser, sir, coutts, lindsay, ought, not, to, have, admitted, works, into, the, gallery, in, which, the, ill, educated, conceit, of, the, artist, so, nearly, approached, the, aspect, of, willful, imposture, i, have, seen, and, heard, much, of, cockney, impudence, before, now, but, never, expected, to, hear, a, coxcomb, ask, two, hundred, guineas, for, flinging, a, pot, of, paint, in, the, public, s, face, whistler, seeing, the, attack, in, the, newspaper, replied, to, his, friend, george, boughton, it, is, the, most, debased, style, of, criticism, i, have, had, thrown, at, me, yet, he, then, went, to, his, solicitor, and, drew, up, a, writ, for, libel, which, was, served, to, ruskin, whistler, hoped, to, recover, 1, 000, plus, the, costs, of, the, action, the, case, came, to, trial, the, following, year, after, delays, caused, by, ruskin, s, bouts, of, mental, illness, while, whistler, s, financial, condition, continued, to, deteriorate, it, was, heard, in, the, exchequer, division, of, the, high, court, on, november, 25, and, 26, 1878, before, baron, huddleston, and, a, special, jury, counsel, for, john, ruskin, attorney, general, sir, john, holker, cross, examined, whistler, holker, what, is, the, subject, of, nocturne, in, black, and, gold, the, falling, rocket, whistler, it, is, a, night, piece, and, represents, the, fireworks, at, cremorne, gardens, holker, not, a, view, of, cremorne, whistler, if, it, were, a, view, of, cremorne, it, would, certainly, bring, about, nothing, but, disappointment, on, the, part, of, the, beholders, it, is, an, artistic, arrangement, that, is, why, i, call, it, a, nocturne, holker, did, it, take, you, much, time, to, paint, the, nocturne, in, black, and, gold, how, soon, did, you, knock, it, off, whistler, oh, i, knock, one, off, possibly, in, a, couple, of, days, one, day, to, do, the, work, and, another, to, finish, it, holker, the, labour, of, two, days, is, that, for, which, you, ask, two, hundred, guineas, whistler, no, i, ask, it, for, the, knowledge, i, have, gained, in, the, work, of, a, lifetime, whistler, had, counted, on, many, artists, to, take, his, side, as, witnesses, but, they, refused, fearing, damage, to, their, reputations, the, other, witnesses, for, him, were, unconvincing, and, the, jury, s, own, reaction, to, the, work, was, derisive, with, ruskin, s, witnesses, more, impressive, including, edward, burne, jones, and, with, ruskin, absent, for, medical, reasons, whistler, s, counterattack, was, ineffective, nonetheless, the, jury, reached, a, verdict, in, favor, of, whistler, but, awarded, a, mere, farthing, in, nominal, damages, and, the, court, costs, were, split, the, cost, of, the, case, together, with, huge, debts, from, building, his, residence, the, white, house, in, tite, street, chelsea, designed, with, e, w, godwin, 1877, 8, bankrupted, him, by, may, 1879, resulting, in, an, auction, of, his, work, collections, and, house, stansky, notes, the, irony, that, the, fine, art, society, of, london, which, had, organized, a, collection, to, pay, for, ruskin, s, legal, costs, supported, him, in, etching, the, stones, of, venice, and, in, exhibiting, the, series, in, 1883, which, helped, recoup, whistler, s, costs, whistler, published, his, account, of, the, trial, in, the, pamphlet, whistler, v, ruskin, art, and, art, critics, included, in, his, later, the, gentle, art, of, making, enemies, 1890, in, december, 1878, soon, after, the, trial, whistler, s, grand, hope, that, the, publicity, of, the, trial, would, rescue, his, career, was, dashed, as, he, lost, rather, than, gained, popularity, among, patrons, because, of, it, among, his, creditors, was, leyland, who, oversaw, the, sale, of, whistler, s, possessions, whistler, made, various, caricatures, of, his, former, patron, including, a, biting, satirical, painting, called, the, gold, scab, just, after, whistler, declared, bankruptcy, whistler, always, blamed, leyland, for, his, financial, downfall, it, is, always, a, delight, to, remember, that, actually, once, mr, whistler, was, really, shy, those, who, had, the, pleasure, of, hearing, his, first, ten, o, clock, must, remember, that, when, he, came, before, his, rather, puzzled, and, distinguished, audience, there, were, a, few, minutes, of, very, palpable, stage, fright, anna, lea, merritt, the, life, of, james, mcneill, whistler, by, e, r, and, j, pennell, volume, 2, 1908, after, the, trial, whistler, received, a, commission, to, do, twelve, etchings, in, venice, he, eagerly, accepted, the, assignment, and, arrived, in, the, city, with, girlfriend, maud, franklin, taking, rooms, in, a, dilapidated, palazzo, they, shared, with, other, artists, including, john, singer, sargent, although, homesick, for, london, he, adapted, to, venice, and, set, about, discovering, its, character, he, did, his, best, to, distract, himself, from, the, gloom, of, his, financial, affairs, and, the, pending, sale, of, all, his, goods, at, sotheby, s, he, was, a, regular, guest, at, parties, at, the, american, consulate, and, with, his, usual, wit, enchanted, the, guests, with, verbal, flourishes, such, as, the, artist, s, only, positive, virtue, is, idleness, and, there, are, so, few, who, are, gifted, at, it, his, new, friends, reported, on, the, contrary, that, whistler, rose, early, and, put, in, a, full, day, of, effort, he, wrote, to, a, friend, i, have, learned, to, know, a, venice, in, venice, that, the, others, never, seem, to, have, perceived, and, which, if, i, bring, back, with, me, as, i, propose, will, far, more, than, compensate, for, all, annoyances, delays, vexations, of, spirit, the, three, month, assignment, stretched, to, fourteen, months, during, this, exceptionally, productive, period, whistler, finished, over, fifty, etchings, several, nocturnes, some, watercolors, and, over, 100, pastels, illustrating, both, the, moods, of, venice, and, its, fine, architectural, details, furthermore, whistler, influenced, the, american, art, community, in, venice, especially, frank, duveneck, and, duveneck, s, boys, and, robert, blum, who, emulated, whistler, s, vision, of, the, city, and, later, spread, his, methods, and, influence, back, to, america, back, in, london, the, pastels, sold, particularly, well, and, he, quipped, they, are, not, as, good, as, i, supposed, they, are, selling, he, was, actively, engaged, in, exhibiting, his, other, work, but, with, limited, success, though, still, struggling, financially, he, was, heartened, by, the, attention, and, admiration, he, received, from, the, younger, generation, of, english, and, american, painters, who, made, him, their, idol, and, eagerly, adopted, the, title, pupil, of, whistler, many, of, them, returned, to, america, and, spread, tales, of, whistler, s, provocative, egotism, sharp, wit, and, aesthetic, pronouncements, establishing, the, legend, of, whistler, much, to, his, satisfaction, in, january, 1881, his, mother, anna, whistler, died, in, her, honour, he, publicly, adopted, her, maiden, name, mcneill, as, a, middle, name, whistler, published, his, first, book, ten, o, clock, lecture, in, 1885, a, major, expression, of, his, belief, in, art, for, art, s, sake, at, the, time, the, opposing, victorian, notion, reigned, namely, that, art, and, indeed, much, human, activity, had, a, moral, or, social, function, to, whistler, however, art, was, its, own, end, and, the, artist, s, responsibility, was, not, to, society, but, to, himself, to, interpret, through, art, and, to, neither, reproduce, nor, moralize, what, he, saw, furthermore, he, stated, nature, is, very, rarely, right, and, must, be, improved, upon, by, the, artist, with, his, own, vision, though, differing, with, whistler, on, several, points, including, his, insistence, that, poetry, was, a, higher, form, of, art, than, painting, oscar, wilde, was, generous, in, his, praise, and, hailed, the, lecture, as, a, masterpiece, not, merely, for, its, clever, satire, and, amusing, jests, but, for, the, pure, and, perfect, beauty, of, many, of, its, passages, for, that, he, is, indeed, one, of, the, very, greatest, masters, of, painting, in, my, opinion, and, i, may, add, that, in, this, opinion, mr, whistler, himself, entirely, concurs, whistler, however, thought, himself, mocked, by, oscar, wilde, and, from, then, on, public, sparring, ensued, leading, to, a, total, breakdown, of, their, friendship, precipitated, by, a, report, written, by, herbert, vivian, later, wilde, symbolically, murdered, whistler, basing, basil, hallward, the, murdered, artist, in, his, novel, the, picture, of, dorian, gray, on, whistler, whistler, joined, the, society, of, british, artists, in, 1884, and, on, june, 1, 1886, he, was, elected, president, the, following, year, during, queen, victoria, s, golden, jubilee, whistler, presented, to, the, queen, on, the, society, s, behalf, an, elaborate, album, including, a, lengthy, written, address, and, illustrations, that, he, made, queen, victoria, so, admired, the, beautiful, and, artistic, illumination, that, she, decreed, henceforth, that, the, society, should, be, called, royal, this, achievement, was, widely, appreciated, by, the, members, but, soon, it, was, overshadowed, by, the, dispute, that, inevitably, arose, with, the, royal, academy, of, arts, whistler, proposed, that, members, of, the, royal, society, should, withdraw, from, the, royal, academy, this, ignited, a, feud, within, the, membership, ranks, that, overshadowed, all, other, society, business, in, may, 1888, nine, members, wrote, to, whistler, to, demand, his, resignation, at, the, annual, meeting, on, june, 4, he, was, defeated, for, re, election, by, a, vote, of, 18, 19, with, nine, abstentions, whistler, and, 25, supporters, resigned, while, the, anti, whistler, majority, in, his, view, was, successful, in, purging, him, for, his, eccentricities, and, non, english, background, with, his, relationship, with, maud, franklin, unraveling, whistler, suddenly, proposed, to, beatrice, godwin, also, called, beatrix, or, trixie, a, former, pupil, and, the, widow, of, his, late, friend, architect, edward, william, godwin, through, his, friendship, with, godwin, whistler, had, become, close, to, beatrice, whom, whistler, painted, in, the, full, length, portrait, titled, harmony, in, red, lamplight, glaha, 46315, by, the, summer, of, 1888, whistler, and, beatrice, appeared, in, public, as, a, couple, at, a, dinner, louise, jopling, and, henry, labouch, re, insisted, that, they, should, be, married, before, the, end, of, the, week, the, marriage, ceremony, was, quickly, arranged, as, a, member, of, parliament, labouch, re, arranged, for, the, chaplain, to, the, house, of, commons, to, marry, the, couple, no, publicity, was, given, to, the, ceremony, to, avoid, the, possibility, of, a, furious, maud, franklin, interrupting, the, marriage, ceremony, the, marriage, took, place, on, august, 11, 1888, with, the, ceremony, attended, by, a, reporter, from, the, pall, mall, gazette, so, that, the, event, received, publicity, the, couple, left, soon, after, for, paris, to, avoid, any, risk, of, a, scene, with, maud, whistler, s, reputation, in, london, and, paris, was, rising, and, he, gained, positive, reviews, from, critics, and, new, commissions, his, book, the, gentle, art, of, making, enemies, was, published, in, 1890, with, mixed, success, but, it, afforded, helpful, publicity, in, 1890, he, met, charles, lang, freer, who, became, a, valuable, patron, in, america, and, ultimately, his, most, important, collector, around, this, time, in, addition, to, portraiture, whistler, experimented, with, early, colour, photography, and, with, lithography, creating, a, series, featuring, london, architecture, and, the, human, figure, mostly, female, nudes, he, contributed, the, first, three, of, his, songs, of, stone, lithographs, to, the, whirlwind, a, neo, jacobite, magazine, published, by, his, friend, herbert, vivian, whistler, had, met, vivian, in, the, late, 1880s, when, both, were, members, of, the, order, of, the, white, rose, the, first, of, the, neo, jacobite, societies, in, 1891, with, help, from, his, close, friend, st, phane, mallarm, whistler, s, mother, was, purchased, by, the, french, government, for, 4, 000, francs, this, was, much, less, than, what, an, american, collector, might, have, paid, but, that, would, not, have, been, so, prestigious, by, whistler, s, reckoning, after, an, indifferent, reception, to, his, solo, show, in, london, featuring, mostly, his, nocturnes, whistler, abruptly, decided, he, had, had, enough, of, london, he, and, trixie, moved, to, paris, in, 1892, and, resided, at, n, 110, rue, du, bac, paris, with, his, studio, at, the, top, of, 86, rue, notre, dame, des, champs, in, montparnasse, he, felt, welcomed, by, his, old, paris, friends, monet, auguste, rodin, henri, de, toulouse, lautrec, as, well, as, st, phane, mallarm, and, he, set, himself, up, a, large, studio, he, was, at, the, top, of, his, career, when, it, was, discovered, that, his, wife, trixie, had, cancer, they, returned, to, london, in, february, 1896, taking, rooms, at, the, savoy, hotel, while, they, sought, medical, treatment, he, made, drawings, on, lithographic, transfer, paper, of, the, view, of, the, river, thames, from, the, hotel, window, or, balcony, as, he, sat, with, her, she, died, a, few, months, later, in, 1899, charles, freer, introduced, whistler, to, his, friend, and, fellow, businessman, richard, albert, canfield, who, became, a, personal, friend, and, patron, of, whistler, s, canfield, owned, a, number, of, fashionable, gambling, houses, in, new, york, and, rhode, island, including, saratoga, springs, and, newport, and, was, also, a, man, of, culture, with, refined, tastes, in, art, he, owned, early, american, and, chippendale, furniture, tapestries, chinese, porcelain, and, barye, bronzes, and, possessed, the, second, largest, and, most, important, whistler, collection, in, the, world, prior, to, his, death, in, 1914, in, may, 1901, canfield, commissioned, a, portrait, from, whistler, he, started, to, pose, for, portrait, of, richard, a, canfield, ymsm, 547, in, march, 1902, according, to, alexander, gardiner, canfield, returned, to, europe, to, sit, for, whistler, at, the, new, year, in, 1903, and, sat, every, day, until, may, 16, 1903, whistler, was, ill, and, frail, at, this, time, and, the, work, was, his, last, completed, portrait, the, deceptive, air, of, respectability, that, the, portrait, gave, canfield, caused, whistler, to, call, it, his, reverence, the, two, men, were, in, correspondence, from, 1901, until, whistler, s, death, a, few, months, before, his, own, death, canfield, sold, his, collection, of, etchings, lithographs, drawings, and, paintings, by, whistler, to, the, american, art, dealer, roland, f, knoedler, for, 300, 000, three, of, canfield, s, whistler, paintings, hang, in, the, frick, museum, in, new, york, city, in, the, final, seven, years, of, his, life, whistler, did, some, minimalist, seascapes, in, watercolor, and, a, final, self, portrait, in, oil, he, corresponded, with, his, many, friends, and, colleagues, whistler, founded, an, art, school, in, 1898, but, his, poor, health, and, infrequent, appearances, led, to, its, closure, in, 1901, he, died, in, london, on, july, 17, 1903, six, days, after, his, 69th, birthday, he, is, buried, in, chiswick, old, cemetery, in, west, london, adjoining, st, nicholas, church, chiswick, whistler, was, the, subject, of, a, 1908, biography, by, his, friends, the, husband, and, wife, team, of, joseph, pennell, and, elizabeth, robins, pennell, printmaker, and, art, critic, respectively, the, pennells, vast, collection, of, whistler, material, was, bequeathed, to, the, library, of, congress, the, artist, s, entire, estate, was, left, to, his, sister, in, law, rosalind, birnie, philip, she, spent, the, rest, of, her, life, defending, his, reputation, and, managing, his, art, and, effects, much, of, which, eventually, was, donated, to, glasgow, university, whistler, had, a, distinctive, appearance, short, and, slight, with, piercing, eyes, and, a, curling, mustache, often, sporting, a, monocle, and, the, flashy, attire, of, a, dandy, he, affected, a, posture, of, self, confidence, and, eccentricity, he, often, was, arrogant, and, selfish, toward, friends, and, patrons, a, constant, self, promoter, and, egoist, he, relished, shocking, friends, and, enemies, though, he, could, be, droll, and, flippant, about, social, and, political, matters, he, always, was, serious,
