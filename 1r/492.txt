the, italian, opera, scene, after, the, era, of, gioachino, rossini, vincenzo, bellini, and, gaetano, donizetti, whose, works, significantly, influenced, him, in, his, early, operas, verdi, demonstrated, sympathy, with, the, risorgimento, movement, which, sought, the, unification, of, italy, he, also, participated, briefly, as, an, elected, politician, the, chorus, va, pensiero, from, his, early, opera, nabucco, 1842, and, similar, choruses, in, later, operas, were, much, in, the, spirit, of, the, unification, movement, and, the, composer, himself, became, esteemed, as, a, representative, of, these, ideals, an, intensely, private, person, verdi, did, not, seek, to, ingratiate, himself, with, popular, movements, as, he, became, professionally, successful, he, was, able, to, reduce, his, operatic, workload, and, sought, to, establish, himself, as, a, landowner, in, his, native, region, he, surprised, the, musical, world, by, returning, after, his, success, with, the, opera, aida, 1871, with, three, late, masterpieces, his, requiem, 1874, and, the, operas, otello, 1887, and, falstaff, 1893, his, operas, remain, extremely, popular, especially, the, three, peaks, of,

borders, of, the, first, french, empire, following, the, annexation, of, the, duchy, of, parma, and, piacenza, in, 1808, the, baptismal, register, prepared, on, 11, october, 1813, lists, his, parents, carlo, and, luigia, as, innkeeper, and, spinner, respectively, additionally, it, lists, verdi, as, being, born, yesterday, but, since, days, were, often, considered, to, begin, at, sunset, this, could, have, meant, either, 9, or, 10, october, following, his, mother, verdi, always, celebrated, his, birthday, on, 9, october, the, day, he, himself, believed, he, was, born, verdi, had, a, younger, sister, giuseppa, who, died, aged, 17, in, 1833, she, is, said, to, have, been, his, closest, friend, during, childhood, from, the, age, of, four, verdi, was, given, private, lessons, in, latin, and, italian, by, the, village, schoolmaster, baistrocchi, and, at, six, he, attended, the, local, school, after, learning, to, play, the, organ, he, showed, so, much, interest, in, music, that, his, parents, finally, provided, him, with, a, spinet, verdi, s, gift, for, music, was, already, apparent, by, 1820, 21, when, he, began, his, association, with, the, local, church, serving, in, the, choir, acting, as, an, altar, boy, for, a, while, and, taking, organ, lessons, after, baistrocchi, s, death, verdi, at, the, age, of, eight, became, the, official, paid, organist, the, music, historian, roger, parker, points, out, that, both, of, verdi, s, parents, belonged, to, families, of, small, landowners, and, traders, certainly, not, the, illiterate, peasants, from, which, verdi, later, liked, to, present, himself, as, having, emerged, carlo, verdi, was, energetic, in, furthering, his, son, s, education, something, which, verdi, tended, to, hide, in, later, life, he, picture, emerges, of, youthful, precocity, eagerly, nurtured, by, an, ambitious, father, and, of, a, sustained, sophisticated, and, elaborate, formal, education, in, 1823, when, he, was, 10, verdi, s, parents, arranged, for, the, boy, to, attend, school, in, busseto, enrolling, him, in, a, ginnasio, an, upper, school, for, boys, run, by, don, pietro, seletti, while, they, continued, to, run, their, inn, at,

marches, for, band, by, the, hundred, perhaps, as, many, little, sinfonie, that, were, used, in, church, in, the, theatre, and, at, concerts, five, or, six, concertos, and, sets, of, variations, for, pianoforte, which, i, played, myself, at, concerts, many, serenades, cantatas, arias, duets, very, many, trios, and, various, pieces, of, church, music, of, which, i, remember, only, a, stabat, mater, this, information, comes, from, the, autobiographical, sketch, which, verdi, dictated, to, the, publisher, giulio, ricordi, late, in, life, in, 1879, and, remains, the, leading, source, for, his, early, life, and, career, written, understandably, with, the, benefit, of, hindsight, it, is, not, always, reliable, when, dealing, with, issues, more, contentious, than, those, of, his, childhood, the, other, director, of, the, philharmonic, society, was, antonio, barezzi, a, wholesale, grocer, and, distiller, who, was, described, by, a, contemporary, as, a, manic, dilettante, of, music, the, young, verdi, did, not, immediately, become, involved, with, the, philharmonic, by, june, 1827, he, had, graduated, with, honours, from, the, ginnasio, and, was, able, to, focus, solely, on, music,

success, mostly, playing, his, own, music, to, the, surprise, of, many, and, receiving, strong, local, recognition, by, 1829, 30, verdi, had, established, himself, as, a, leader, of, the, philharmonic, none, of, us, could, rival, him, reported, the, secretary, of, the, organisation, giuseppe, demald, an, eight, movement, cantata, i, deliri, di, saul, based, on, a, drama, by, vittorio, alfieri, was, written, by, verdi, when, he, was, 15, and, performed, in, bergamo, it, was, acclaimed, by, both, demald, and, barezzi, who, commented, he, shows, a, vivid, imagination, a, philosophical, outlook, and, sound, judgment, in, the, arrangement, of, instrumental, parts, in, late, 1829, verdi, had, completed, his, studies, with, provesi, who, declared, that, he, had, no, more, to, teach, verdi, at, the, time, verdi, had, been, giving, singing, and, piano, lessons, to, barezzi, s, daughter, margherita, by, 1831, they, were, unofficially, engaged, verdi, set, his, sights, on, milan, then, the, cultural, capital, of, northern, italy, where, he, applied, unsuccessfully, to, study, at, the, conservatory, barezzi, made, arrangements, for, him, to, become, a, private, pupil, of, vincenzo, lavigna, who, had, been, maestro, concertatore, at, la, scala, and, who, described, verdi, s, compositions, as, very, promising, lavigna, encouraged, verdi, to, take, out, a, subscription, to, la, scala, where, he, heard, maria, malibran, in, operas, by, gioachino, rossini, and, vincenzo, bellini, verdi, began, making, connections, in, the, milanese, world, of, music, that, were, to, stand, him, in, good, stead, these, included, an, introduction, by, lavigna, to, an, amateur, choral, group, the, societ, filarmonica, led, by, pietro, massini, attending, the, societ, frequently, in, 1834, verdi, soon, found, himself, functioning, as, rehearsal, director, for, rossini, s, la, cenerentola, and, continuo, player, it, was, massini, who, encouraged, him, to, write, his, first, opera, originally, titled, rocester, to, a, libretto, by, the, journalist, antonio, piazza, in, mid, 1834, verdi, sought, to, acquire, provesi, s, former, post, in, busseto, but, without, success, but, with, barezzi, s, help, he, did, obtain, the, secular, post, of, maestro, di, musica, he, taught, gave, lessons, and, conducted, the, philharmonic, for, several, months, before, returning, to, milan, in, early, 1835, by, the, following, july, he, obtained, his, certification, from, lavigna, eventually, in, 1835, verdi, became, director, of, the, busseto, school, with, a,

stage, his, opera, in, milan, the, la, scala, impresario, bartolomeo, merelli, agreed, to, put, on, oberto, as, the, reworked, opera, was, now, called, with, a, libretto, rewritten, by, temistocle, solera, in, november, 1839, it, achieved, a, respectable, 13, additional, performances, following, which, merelli, offered, verdi, a, contract, for, three, more, works, in, 1838, 1839, verdi,

of, 26, verdi, adored, his, wife, and, children, and, was, devastated, by, their, early, deaths, un, giorno, a, comedy, was, premiered, only, a, few, months, later, it, was, a, flop, and, only, given, one, performance, following, its, failure, it, is, claimed, verdi, vowed, never, to, compose, again, but, in, his, sketch, he, recounts, how, merelli, persuaded, him, to, write, a, new, opera, verdi, was, to, claim, that, he, gradually, began, to, work, on, the, music, for, nabucco, the, libretto, of, which, had, originally, been, rejected, by, the, composer, otto, nicolai, this, verse, today, tomorrow, that, here, a, note, there, a, whole, phrase, and, little, by, little, the, opera, was, written, he, later, recalled, by, the, autumn, of, 1841, it, was, complete, originally, under, the, title, nabucodonosor, well, received, at, its, first, performance, on, 9, march, 1842, nabucco, underpinned, verdi, s, success, until, his, retirement, from, the, theatre, twenty, nine, operas, including, some, revised, and, updated, versions, later, at, its, revival, in, la, scala, for, the, 1842, autumn, season, it, was, given, an, unprecedented, and, later, unequalled, total, of, 57, performances, within, three, years, it, had, reached, among, other, venues, vienna, lisbon, barcelona, berlin, paris, and, hamburg, in, 1848, it, was, heard, in, new, york, in, 1850, in, buenos, aires, porter, comments, that, similar, accounts, could, be, provided, to, show, how, widely, and, rapidly, all, other, successful, operas, were, disseminated, a, period, of, hard, work, for, verdi, with, the, creation, of, twenty, operas, excluding, revisions, and, translations, followed, over, the, next, sixteen, years, culminating, in, un, ballo, in, maschera, this, period, was, not, without, its, frustrations, and, setbacks, for, the, young, composer, and, he, was, frequently, demoralised, in, april, 1845, in, connection, with, i, due, foscari, he, wrote, i, am, happy, no, matter, what, reception, it, gets, and, i, am, utterly, indifferent, to, everything, i, cannot, wait, for, these, next, three, years, to, pass, i, have, to, write, six, operas, then, addio, to, everything, in, 1858, verdi, complained, since, nabucco, you, may, say, i, have, never, had, one, hour, of, peace, sixteen, years, in, the, galleys, after, the, initial, success, of, nabucco, verdi, settled, in, milan, making, a, number, of, influential, acquaintances, he, attended, the, salotto, maffei, countess, clara, maffei, s, salons, in, milan, becoming, her, lifelong, friend, and, correspondent, a, revival, of, nabucco, followed, in, 1842, at, la, scala, where, it, received, a, run, of, fifty, seven, performances, and, this, led, to, a, commission, from, merelli, for, a, new, opera, for, the, 1843, season, i, lombardi, alla, prima, crociata, was, based, on, a, libretto, by, solera, and, premiered, in, february, 1843, inevitably, comparisons, were, made, with, nabucco, but, one, contemporary, writer, noted, if, created, this, young, man, s, reputation, i, lombardi, served, to, confirm, it, verdi, paid, close, attention, to, his, financial, contracts, making, sure, he, was, appropriately, remunerated, as, his, popularity, increased, for, i, lombardi, and, ernani, 1844, in, venice, he, was, paid, 12, 000, lire, including, supervision, of, the, productions, attila, and, macbeth, 1847, each, brought, him, 18, 000, lire, his, contracts, with, the, publishers, ricordi, in, 1847, were, very, specific, about, the, amounts, he, was, to, receive, for, new, works, first, productions, musical, arrangements, and, so, on, he, began, to, use, his, growing, prosperity, to, invest, in, land, near, his, birthplace, in, 1844, he, purchased, il, pulgaro, 62, acres, 23, hectares, of, farmland, with, a, farmhouse, and, outbuildings, providing, a, home, for, his, parents, from, may, 1844, later, that, year, he, also, bought, the, palazzo, cavalli, now, known, as, the, palazzo, orlandi, on, the, via, roma, busseto, s, main, street, in, may, 1848, verdi, signed, a, contract, for, land, and, houses, at, sant, agata, in, busseto, which, had, once, belonged, to, his, family, it, was, here, he, built, his, own, house, completed, in, 1880, now, known, as, the, villa, verdi, where, he, lived, from, 1851, until, his, death, in, march, 1843, verdi, visited, vienna, where, gaetano, donizetti, was, musical, director, to, oversee, a, production, of, nabucco, the, older, composer, recognising, verdi, s, talent, noted, in, a, letter, of, january, 1844, i, am, very, very, happy, to, give, way, to, people, of, talent, like, verdi, nothing, will, prevent, the, good, verdi, from, soon, reaching, one, of, the, most, honourable, positions, in, the, cohort, of, composers, verdi, travelled, on, to, parma, where, the, teatro, regio, di, parma, was, producing, nabucco, with, giuseppina, strepponi, in, the, cast, for, verdi, the, performances, were, a, personal, triumph, in, his, native, region, especially, as, his, father, carlo, attended, the, first, performance, verdi, remained, in, parma, for, some, weeks, beyond, his, intended, departure, date, this, fuelled, speculation, that, the, delay, was, due, to, verdi, s, interest, in, strepponi, who, stated, that, their, relationship, began, in, 1843, strepponi, was, in, fact, known, for, her, amorous, relationships, and, many, illegitimate, children, and, her, history, was, an, awkward, factor, in, their, relationship, until, they, eventually, agreed, on, marriage, after, successful, stagings, of, nabucco, in, venice, with, twenty, five, performances, in, the, 1842, 43, season, verdi, began, negotiations, with, the, impresario, of, la, fenice, to, stage, i, lombardi, and, to, write, a, new, opera, eventually, victor, hugo, s, hernani, was, chosen, with, francesco, maria, piave, as, librettist, ernani, was, successfully, premiered, in, 1844, and, within, six, months, had, been, performed, at, twenty, other, theatres, in, italy, and, also, in, vienna, the, writer, andrew, porter, notes, that, for, the, next, ten, years, verdi, s, life, reads, like, a, travel, diary, a, timetable, of, visits, to, bring, new, operas, to, the, stage, or, to, supervise, local, premieres, la, scala, premiered, none, of, these, new, works, except, for, giovanna, d, arco, verdi, never, forgave, the, milanese, for, their, reception, of, un, giorno, di, regno, during, this, period, verdi, began, to, work, more, consistently, with, his, librettists, he, relied, on, piave, again, for, i, due, foscari, performed, in, rome, in, november, 1844, then, on, solera, once, more, for, giovanna, d, arco, at, la, scala, in, february, 1845, while, in, august, that, year, he, was, able, to, work, with, salvadore, cammarano, on, alzira, for, the, teatro, di, san, carlo, in, naples, solera, and, piave, worked, together, on, attila, for, la, fenice, march, 1846, in, april, 1844, verdi, took, on, emanuele, muzio, eight, years, his, junior, as, a, pupil, and, amanuensis, he, had, known, him, since, about, 1828, as, another, of, barezzi, s, prot, g, s, muzio, who, in, fact, was, verdi, s, only, pupil, became, indispensable, to, the, composer, he, reported, to, barezzi, that, verdi, has, a, breadth, of, spirit, of, generosity, a, wisdom, in, november, 1846, muzio, wrote, of, verdi, if, you, could, see, us, i, seem, more, like, a, friend, rather, than, his, pupil, we, are, always, together, at, dinner, in, the, cafes, when, we, play, cards, all, in, all, he, doesn, t, go, anywhere, without, me, at, his, side, in, the, house, we, have, a, big, table, and, we, both, write, there, together, and, so, i, always, have, his, advice, muzio, was, to, remain, associated, with, verdi, assisting, in, the, preparation, of, scores, and, transcriptions, and, later, conducting, many, of, his, works, in, their, premiere, performances, in, the, us, and, elsewhere, outside, italy, he, was, chosen, by, verdi, as, one, of, the, executors, of, his, will, but, predeceased, the, composer, in, 1890, after, a, period, of, illness, verdi, began, work, on, macbeth, in, september, 1846, he, dedicated, the, opera, to, barezzi, i, have, long, intended, to, dedicate, an, opera, to, you, as, you, have, been, a, father, a, benefactor, and, a, friend, for, me, it, was, a, duty, i, should, have, fulfilled, sooner, if, imperious, circumstances, had, not, prevented, me, now, i, send, you, macbeth, which, i, prize, above, all, my, other, operas, and, therefore, deem, worthier, to, present, to, you, in, 1997, martin, chusid, wrote, that, macbeth, was, the, only, one, of, verdi, s, operas, of, his, early, period, to, remain, regularly, in, the, international, repertoire, although, in, the, 21st, century, nabucco, has, also, entered, the, lists, strepponi, s, voice, declined, and, her, engagements, dried, up, in, the, 1845, to, 1846, period, and, she, returned, to, live, in, milan, whilst, retaining, contact, with, verdi, as, his, supporter, promoter, unofficial, adviser, and, occasional, secretary, until, she, decided, to, move, to, paris, in, october, 1846, before, she, left, verdi, gave, her, a, letter, that, pledged, his, love, on, the, envelope, strepponi, wrote, 5, or, 6, october, 1846, they, shall, lay, this, letter, on, my, heart, when, they, bury, me, verdi, had, completed, i, masnadieri, for, london, by, may, 1847, except, for, the, orchestration, this, he, left, until, the, opera, was, in, rehearsal, since, he, wanted, to, hear, la, lind, and, modify, her, role, to, suit, her, more, exactly, verdi, agreed, to, conduct, the, premiere, on, 22, july, 1847, at, her, majesty, s, theatre, as, well, as, the, second, performance, queen, victoria, and, prince, albert, attended, the, first, performance, and, for, the, most, part, the, press, was, generous, in, its, praise, for, the, next, two, years, except, for, two, visits, to, italy, during, periods, of, political, unrest, verdi, was, based, in, paris, within, a, week, of, returning, to, paris, in, july, 1847, he, received, his, first, commission, from, the, paris, op, ra, verdi, agreed, to, adapt, i, lombardi, to, a, new, french, libretto, the, result, was, j, rusalem, which, contained, significant, changes, to, the, music, and, structure, of, the, work, including, an, extensive, ballet, scene, to, meet, parisian, expectations, verdi, was, awarded, the, order, of, chevalier, of, the, legion, of, honour, to, satisfy, his, contracts, with, the, publisher, francesco, lucca, verdi, dashed, off, il, corsaro, budden, comments, in, no, other, opera, of, his, does, verdi, appear, to, have, taken, so, little, interest, before, it, was, staged, on, hearing, the, news, of, the, cinque, giornate, the, five, days, of, street, fighting, that, took, place, between, 18, and, 22, march, 1848, and, temporarily, drove, the, austrians, out, of, milan, verdi, travelled, there, arriving, on, 5, april, he, discovered, that, piave, was, now, citizen, piave, of, the, newly, proclaimed, republic, of, san, marco, writing, a, patriotic, letter, to, him, in, venice, verdi, concluded, banish, every, petty, municipal, idea, we, must, all, extend, a, fraternal, hand, and, italy, will, yet, become, the, first, nation, of, the, world, i, am, drunk, with, joy, imagine, that, there, are, no, more, germans, here, verdi, had, been, admonished, by, the, poet, giuseppe, giusti, for, turning, away, from, patriotic, subjects, the, poet, pleading, with, him, to, do, what, you, can, to, nourish, the, to, strengthen, it, and, direct, it, to, its, goal, cammarano, suggested, adapting, joseph, m, ry, s, 1828, play, la, bataille, de, toulouse, which, he, described, as, a, story, that, should, stir, every, man, with, an, italian, soul, in, his, breast, the, premiere, was, set, for, late, january, 1849, verdi, travelled, to, rome, before, the, end, of, 1848, he, found, that, city, on, the, verge, of, becoming, a, short, lived, republic, which, commenced, within, days, of, la, battaglia, di, legnano, s, enthusiastically, received, premiere, in, the, spirit, of, the, time, were, the, tenor, hero, s, final, words, whoever, dies, for, the, fatherland, cannot, be, evil, minded, verdi, had, intended, to, return, to, italy, in, early, 1848, but, was, prevented, by, work, and, illness, as, well, as, most, probably, by, his, increasing, attachment, to, strepponi, verdi, and, strepponi, left, paris, in, july, 1849, the, immediate, cause, being, an, outbreak, of, cholera, and, verdi, went, directly, to, busseto, to, continue, work, on, completing, his, latest, opera, luisa, miller, for, a, production, in, naples, later, in, the, year, verdi, was, committed, to, the, publisher, giovanni, ricordi, for, an, opera, which, became, stiffelio, for, trieste, in, the, spring, of, 1850, and, subsequently, following, negotiations, with, la, fenice, developed, a, libretto, with, piave, and, wrote, the, music, for, rigoletto, based, on, victor, hugo, s, le, roi, s, amuse, for, venice, in, march, 1851, this, was, the, first, of, a, sequence, of, three, operas, followed, by, il, trovatore, and, la, traviata, which, were, to, cement, his, fame, as, a, master, of, opera, the, failure, of, stiffelio, attributable, not, least, to, the, censors, of, the, time, taking, offence, at, the, taboo, subject, of, the, supposed, adultery, of, a, clergyman, s, wife, and, interfering, with, the, text, and, roles, incited, verdi, to, take, pains, to, rework, it, although, even, in, the, completely, recycled, version, of, aroldo, 1857, it, still, failed, to, please, rigoletto, with, its, intended, murder, of, royalty, and, its, sordid, attributes, also, upset, the, censors, verdi, would, not, compromise, what, does, the, sack, matter, to, the, police, are, they, worried, about, the, effect, it, will, produce, do, they, think, they, know, better, than, i, i, see, the, hero, has, been, made, no, longer, ugly, and, hunchbacked, why, a, singing, hunchback, why, not, i, think, it, splendid, to, show, this, character, as, outwardly, deformed, and, ridiculous, and, inwardly, passionate, and, full, of, love, i, chose, the, subject, for, these, very, qualities, if, they, are, removed, i, can, no, longer, set, it, to, music, verdi, substituted, a, duke, for, the, king, and, the, public, response, and, subsequent, success, of, the, opera, all, over, italy, and, europe, fully, vindicated, the, composer, aware, that, the, melody, of, the, duke, s, song, la, donna, mobile, woman, is, fickle, would, become, a, popular, hit, verdi, excluded, it, from, orchestral, rehearsals, for, the, opera, and, rehearsed, the, tenor, separately, for, several, months, verdi, was, preoccupied, with, family, matters, these, stemmed, from, the, way, in, which, the, citizens, of, busseto, were, treating, giuseppina, strepponi, with, whom, he, was, living, openly, in, an, unmarried, relationship, she, was, shunned, in, the, town, and, at, church, and, while, verdi, appeared, indifferent, she, was, certainly, not, furthermore, verdi, was, concerned, about, the, administration, of, his, newly, acquired, property, at, sant, agata, a, growing, estrangement, between, verdi, and, his, parents, was, perhaps, also, attributable, to, strepponi, the, suggestion, that, this, situation, was, sparked, by, the, birth, of, a, child, to, verdi, and, strepponi, which, was, given, away, as, a, foundling, lacks, any, firm, evidence, in, january, 1851, verdi, broke, off, relations, with, his, parents, and, in, april, they, were, ordered, to, leave, sant, agata, verdi, found, new, premises, for, them, and, helped, them, financially, to, settle, into, their, new, home, it, may, not, be, coincidental, that, all, six, verdi, operas, written, in, the, period, 1849, 1853, la, battaglia, luisa, miller, stiffelio, rigoletto, il, trovatore, and, la, traviata, have, uniquely, in, his, oeuvre, heroines, who, are, in, the, opera, critic, joseph, kerman, s, words, women, who, come, to, grief, because, of, sexual, transgression, actual, or, perceived, kerman, like, the, psychologist, gerald, mendelssohn, sees, this, choice, of, subjects, as, being, influenced, by, verdi, s, uneasy, passion, for, strepponi, verdi, and, strepponi, moved, into, sant, agata, on, 1, may, 1851, may, also, brought, an, offer, for, a, new, opera, from, la, fenice, which, verdi, eventually, realised, as, la, traviata, that, was, followed, by, an, agreement, with, the, rome, opera, company, to, present, il, trovatore, for, january, 1853, verdi, now, had, sufficient, earnings, to, retire, had, he, wished, to, he, had, reached, a, stage, where, he, could, develop, his, operas, as, he, wished, rather, than, be, dependent, on, commissions, from, third, parties, il, trovatore, was, in, fact, the, first, opera, he, wrote, without, a, specific, commission, apart, from, oberto, at, around, the, same, time, he, began, to, consider, creating, an, opera, from, shakespeare, s, king, lear, after, first, 1850, seeking, a, libretto, from, cammarano, which, never, appeared, verdi, later, 1857, commissioned, one, from, antonio, somma, but, this, proved, intractable, and, no, music, was, ever, written, verdi, began, work, on, il, trovatore, after, the, death, of, his, mother, in, june, 1851, the, fact, that, this, is, the, one, opera, of, verdi, s, which, focuses, on, a, mother, rather, than, a, father, is, perhaps, related, to, her, death, in, the, winter, of, 1851, 52, verdi, decided, to, go, to, paris, with, strepponi, where, he, concluded, an, agreement, with, the, op, ra, to, write, what, became, les, v, pres, siciliennes, his, first, original, work, in, the, style, of, grand, opera, in, february, 1852, the, couple, attended, a, performance, of, alexander, dumas, fils, s, play, the, lady, of, the, camellias, verdi, immediately, began, to, compose, music, for, what, would, later, become, la, traviata, after, his, visit, to, rome, for, il, trovatore, in, january, 1853, verdi, worked, on, completing, la, traviata, but, with, little, hope, of, its, success, due, to, his, lack, of, confidence, in, any, of, the, singers, engaged, for, the, season, furthermore, the, management, insisted, that, the, opera, be, given, a, historical, not, a, contemporary, setting, the, premiere, in, march, 1853, was, indeed, a, failure, verdi, wrote, was, the, fault, mine, or, the, singers, time, will, tell, subsequent, productions, following, some, rewriting, throughout, europe, over, the, following, two, years, fully, vindicated, the, composer, roger, parker, has, written, il, trovatore, consistently, remains, one, of, the, three, or, four, most, popular, operas, in, the, verdian, repertoire, but, it, has, never, pleased, the, critics, in, the, eleven, years, up, to, and, including, traviata, verdi, had, written, sixteen, operas, over, the, next, eighteen, years, up, to, aida, he, wrote, only, six, new, works, for, the, stage, verdi, was, happy, to, return, to, sant, agata, and, in, february, 1856, was, reporting, a, total, abandonment, of, music, a, little, reading, some, light, occupation, with, agriculture, and, horses, that, s, all, a, couple, of, months, later, writing, in, the, same, vein, to, countess, maffei, he, stated, i, m, not, doing, anything, i, don, t, read, i, don, t, write, i, walk, in, the, fields, from, morning, to, evening, trying, to, recover, so, far, without, success, from, the, stomach, trouble, caused, me, by, i, vespri, siciliani, cursed, operas, an, 1858, letter, by, strepponi, to, the, publisher, l, on, escudier, describes, the, kind, of, lifestyle, that, increasingly, appealed, to, the, composer, his, love, for, the, country, has, become, a, mania, madness, rage, and, fury, anything, you, like, that, is, exaggerated, he, gets, up, almost, with, the, dawn, to, go, and, examine, the, wheat, the, maize, the, vines, etc, fortunately, our, tastes, for, this, sort, of, life, coincide, except, in, the, matter, of, sunrise, which, he, likes, to, see, up, and, dressed, and, i, from, my, bed, nonetheless, on, 15, may, verdi, signed, a, contract, with, la, fenice, for, an, opera, for, the, following, spring, this, was, to, be, simon, boccanegra, the, couple, stayed, in, paris, until, january, 1857, to, deal, with, these, proposals, and, also, the, offer, to, stage, the, translated, version, of, il, trovatore, as, a, grand, opera, verdi, and, strepponi, travelled, to, venice, in, march, for, the, premiere, of, simon, boccanegra, which, turned, out, to, be, a, fiasco, as, verdi, reported, although, on, the, second, and, third, nights, the, reception, improved, considerably, with, strepponi, verdi, went, to, naples, early, in, january, 1858, to, work, with, somma, on, the, libretto, of, the, opera, gustave, iii, which, over, a, year, later, would, become, un, ballo, in, maschera, by, this, time, verdi, had, begun, to, write, about, strepponi, as, my, wife, and, she, was, signing, her, letters, as, giuseppina, verdi, verdi, raged, against, the, stringent, requirements, of, the, neapolitan, censor, stating, i, m, drowning, in, a, sea, of, troubles, it, s, almost, certain, that, the, censors, will, forbid, our, libretto, with, no, hope, of, seeing, his, gustavo, iii, staged, as, written, he, broke, his, contract, this, resulted, in, litigation, and, counter, litigation, with, the, legal, issues, resolved, verdi, was, free, to, present, the, libretto, and, musical, outline, of, gustave, iii, to, the, rome, opera, there, the, censors, demanded, further, changes, at, this, point, the, opera, took, the, title, un, ballo, in, maschera, arriving, in, sant, agata, in, march, 1859, verdi, and, strepponi, found, the, nearby, city, of, piacenza, occupied, by, about, 6, 000, austrian, troops, who, had, made, it, their, base, to, combat, the, rise, of, italian, interest, in, unification, in, the, piedmont, region, in, the, ensuing, second, italian, war, of, independence, the, austrians, abandoned, the, region, and, began, to, leave, lombardy, although, they, remained, in, control, of, the, venice, region, under, the, terms, of, the, armistice, signed, at, villafranca, verdi, was, disgusted, at, this, outcome, here, then, is, the, independence, of, italy, so, long, hoped, for, and, promised, venice, is, not, italian, after, so, many, victories, what, an, outcome, it, is, enough, to, drive, one, mad, he, wrote, to, clara, maffei, verdi, and, strepponi, now, decided, on, marriage, they, travelled, to, collonges, sous, sal, ve, a, village, then, part, of, piedmont, on, 29, august, 1859, the, couple, were, married, there, with, only, the, coachman, who, had, driven, them, there, and, the, church, bell, ringer, as, witnesses, at, the, end, of, 1859, verdi, wrote, to, his, friend, cesare, de, sanctis, i, have, not, made, any, more, music, i, have, not, seen, any, more, music, i, have, not, thought, anymore, about, music, i, don, t, even, know, what, colour, my, last, opera, is, and, i, almost, don, t, remember, it, he, began, to, remodel, sant, agata, which, took, most, of, 1860, to, complete, and, on, which, he, continued, to, work, for, the, next, twenty, years, this, included, major, work, on, a, square, room, that, became, his, workroom, his, bedroom, and, his, office, having, achieved, some, fame, and, prosperity, verdi, began, in, 1859, to, take, an, active, interest, in, italian, politics, his, early, commitment, to, the, risorgimento, movement, is, difficult, to, estimate, accurately, in, the, words, of, the, music, historian, philip, gossett, myths, intensifying, and, exaggerating, sentiment, began, circulating, during, the, nineteenth, century, an, example, is, the, claim, that, when, the, va, pensiero, chorus, in, nabucco, was, first, sung, in, milan, the, audience, responding, with, nationalistic, fervour, demanded, an, encore, as, encores, were, expressly, forbidden, by, the, government, at, the, time, such, a, gesture, would, have, been, extremely, significant, but, in, fact, the, piece, encored, was, not, va, pensiero, but, the, hymn, immenso, jehova, the, growth, of, the, identification, of, verdi, s, music, with, italian, nationalist, politics, perhaps, began, in, the, 1840s, in, 1848, the, nationalist, leader, giuseppe, mazzini, whom, verdi, had, met, in, london, the, previous, year, requested, verdi, who, complied, to, write, a, patriotic, hymn, the, opera, historian, charles, osborne, describes, the, 1849, la, battaglia, di, legnano, as, an, opera, with, a, purpose, and, maintains, that, while, parts, of, verdi, s, earlier, operas, had, frequently, been, taken, up, by, the, fighters, of, the, risorgimento, this, time, the, composer, had, given, the, movement, its, own, opera, it, was, not, until, 1859, in, naples, and, only, then, spreading, throughout, italy, that, the, slogan, viva, verdi, was, used, as, an, acronym, for, viva, v, ittorio, e, manuele, r, e, d, i, talia, viva, victor, emmanuel, king, of, italy, who, was, then, king, of, piedmont, after, italy, was, unified, in, 1861, many, of, verdi, s, early, operas, were, increasingly, re, interpreted, as, risorgimento, works, with, hidden, revolutionary, messages, that, perhaps, had, not, been, originally, intended, by, either, the, composer, or, his, librettists, in, 1859, verdi, was, elected, as, a, member, of, the, new, provincial, council, and, was, appointed, to, head, a, group, of, five, who, would, meet, with, king, vittorio, emanuele, ii, in, turin, they, were, enthusiastically, greeted, along, the, way, and, in, turin, verdi, himself, received, much, of, the, publicity, on, 17, october, verdi, met, with, cavour, the, architect, of, the, initial, stages, of, italian, unification, later, that, year, the, government, of, emilia, was, subsumed, under, the, united, provinces, of, central, italy, and, verdi, s, political, life, temporarily, came, to, an, end, whilst, still, maintaining, nationalist, feelings, he, declined, in, 1860, the, office, of, provincial, council, member, to, which, he, had, been, elected, in, absentia, cavour, however, was, anxious, to, convince, a, man, of, verdi, s, stature, that, running, for, political, office, was, essential, to, strengthening, and, securing, italy, s, future, the, composer, confided, to, piave, some, years, later, that, i, accepted, on, the, condition, that, after, a, few, months, i, would, resign, verdi, was, elected, on, 3, february, 1861, for, the, town, of, borgo, san, donnino, fidenza, to, the, parliament, of, piedmont, sardinia, in, turin, which, from, march, 1861, became, the, parliament, of, the, kingdom, of, italy, but, following, the, death, of, cavour, in, 1861, which, deeply, distressed, him, he, scarcely, attended, later, in, 1874, verdi, was, appointed, a, member, of, the, italian, senate, but, did, not, participate, in, its, activities, in, the, months, following, the, staging, of, ballo, verdi, was, approached, by, several, opera, companies, seeking, a, new, work, or, making, offers, to, stage, one, of, his, existing, ones, but, refused, them, all, but, when, in, december, 1860, an, approach, was, made, from, saint, petersburg, s, imperial, theatre, the, offer, of, 60, 000, francs, plus, all, expenses, was, doubtless, a, strong, incentive, verdi, came, up, with, the, idea, of, adapting, the, 1835, spanish, play, don, alvaro, o, la, fuerza, del, sino, by, angel, saavedra, which, became, la, forza, del, destino, with, piave, writing, the, libretto, the, verdis, arrived, in, st, petersburg, in, december, 1861, for, the, premiere, but, casting, problems, meant, that, it, had, to, be, postponed, returning, via, paris, from, russia, on, 24, february, 1862, verdi, met, two, young, italian, writers, the, twenty, year, old, arrigo, boito, and, franco, faccio, verdi, had, been, invited, to, write, a, piece, of, music, for, the, 1862, international, exhibition, in, london, and, charged, boito, with, writing, a, text, which, became, the, inno, delle, nazioni, boito, as, a, supporter, of, the, grand, opera, of, giacomo, meyerbeer, and, an, opera, composer, in, his, own, right, was, later, in, the, 1860s, critical, of, verdi, s, reliance, on, formula, rather, than, form, incurring, the, composer, s, wrath, nevertheless, he, was, to, become, verdi, s, close, collaborator, in, his, final, operas, the, st, petersburg, premiere, of, la, forza, finally, took, place, in, september, 1862, and, verdi, received, the, order, of, st, stanislaus, a, revival, of, macbeth, in, paris, in, 1865, was, not, a, success, but, he, obtained, a, commission, for, a, new, work, don, carlos, based, on, the, play, don, carlos, by, friedrich, schiller, he, and, giuseppina, spent, late, 1866, and, much, of, 1867, in, paris, where, they, heard, and, did, not, warm, to, giacomo, meyerbeer, s, last, opera, l, africaine, and, richard, wagner, s, overture, to, tannh, user, the, opera, s, premiere, in, 1867, drew, mixed, comments, while, the, critic, th, ophile, gautier, praised, the, work, the, composer, georges, bizet, was, disappointed, at, verdi, s, changing, style, verdi, is, no, longer, italian, he, is, following, wagner, during, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, verdi, paid, great, attention, to, his, estate, around, busseto, purchasing, additional, land, dealing, with, unsatisfactory, in, one, case, embezzling, stewards, installing, irrigation, and, coping, with, variable, harvests, and, economic, slumps, in, 1867, both, verdi, s, father, carlo, with, whom, he, had, restored, good, relations, and, his, early, patron, and, father, in, law, antonio, barezzi, died, verdi, and, giuseppina, decided, to, adopt, carlo, s, great, niece, filomena, maria, verdi, then, seven, years, old, as, their, own, child, she, was, to, marry, in, 1878, the, son, of, verdi, s, friend, and, lawyer, angelo, carrara, and, her, family, became, eventually, the, heirs, of, verdi, s, estate, aida, was, commissioned, by, the, egyptian, government, for, the, opera, house, built, by, the, khedive, isma, il, pasha, to, celebrate, the, opening, of, the, suez, canal, in, 1869, the, opera, house, actually, opened, with, a, production, of, rigoletto, the, prose, libretto, in, french, by, camille, du, locle, based, on, a, scenario, by, the, egyptologist, auguste, mariette, was, transformed, into, italian, verse, by, antonio, ghislanzoni, verdi, was, offered, the, enormous, sum, of, 150, 000, francs, for, the, opera, even, though, he, confessed, that, ancient, egypt, was, a, civilization, i, have, never, been, able, to, admire, and, it, was, first, performed, in, cairo, in, 1871, verdi, spent, much, of, 1872, and, 1873, supervising, the, italian, productions, of, aida, at, milan, parma, and, naples, effectively, acting, as, producer, and, demanding, high, standards, and, adequate, rehearsal, time, during, the, rehearsals, for, the, naples, production, he, wrote, his, string, quartet, the, only, chamber, music, by, him, to, survive, and, the, only, major, work, in, the, form, by, an, italian, of, the, 19th, century, in, 1869, verdi, had, been, asked, to, compose, a, section, for, a, requiem, mass, in, memory, of, rossini, he, compiled, and, completed, the, requiem, but, its, performance, was, abandoned, and, its, premiere, did, not, take, place, until, 1988, five, years, later, verdi, reworked, his, libera, me, section, of, the, rossini, requiem, and, made, it, a, part, of, his, requiem, honouring, alessandro, manzoni, who, had, died, in, 1873, the, complete, requiem, was, first, performed, at, the, cathedral, in, milan, on, the, anniversary, of, manzoni, s, death, on, 22, may, 1874, the, spinto, soprano, teresa, stolz, 1834, 1902, who, had, sung, in, la, scala, productions, from, 1865, onwards, was, the, soloist, in, the, first, and, many, later, performances, of, the, requiem, in, february, 1872, she, had, created, aida, in, its, european, premiere, in, milan, she, became, closely, associated, personally, with, verdi, exactly, how, closely, remains, conjectural, to, giuseppina, verdi, s, initial, disquiet, but, the, women, were, reconciled, and, stolz, remained, a, companion, of, verdi, after, giuseppina, s, death, in, 1897, until, his, own, death, verdi, conducted, his, requiem, in, paris, london, and, vienna, in, 1875, and, in, cologne, in, 1876, it, seemed, that, it, would, be, his, last, work, in, the, words, of, his, biographer, john, rosselli, it, confirmed, him, as, the, unique, presiding, genius, of, italian, music, no, fellow, composer, came, near, him, in, popularity, or, reputation, verdi, now, in, his, sixties, initially, seemed, to, withdraw, into, retirement, he, deliberately, shied, away, from, opportunities, to, publicise, himself, or, to, become, involved, with, new, productions, of, his, works, but, secretly, he, began, work, on, otello, which, boito, to, whom, the, composer, had, been, reconciled, by, ricordi, had, proposed, to, him, privately, in, 1879, the, composition, was, delayed, by, a, revision, of, simon, boccanegra, which, verdi, undertook, with, boito, produced, in, 1881, and, a, revision, of, don, carlos, even, when, otello, was, virtually, completed, verdi, teased, shall, i, finish, it, shall, i, have, it, performed, hard, to, tell, even, for, me, as, news, leaked, out, verdi, was, pressed, by, opera, houses, across, europe, with, enquiries, eventually, the, opera, was, triumphantly, premiered, at, la, scala, in, february, 1887, following, the, success, of, otello, verdi, commented, after, having, relentlessly, massacred, so, many, heroes, and, heroines, i, have, at, last, the, right, to, laugh, a, little, he, had, considered, a, variety, of, comic, subjects, but, had, found, none, of, them, wholly, suitable, and, confided, his, ambition, to, boito, the, librettist, said, nothing, at, the, time, but, secretly, began, work, on, a, libretto, based, on, the, merry, wives, of, windsor, with, additional, material, taken, from, henry, iv, part, 1, and, part, 2, verdi, received, the, draft, libretto, probably, in, early, july, 1889, after, he, had, just, read, shakespeare, s, play, benissimo, benissimo, no, one, could, have, done, better, than, you, he, wrote, back, to, boito, but, he, still, had, doubts, his, age, his, health, which, he, admits, to, being, good, and, his, ability, to, complete, the, project, if, i, were, not, to, finish, the, music, if, the, project, failed, it, would, have, been, a, waste, of, boito, s, time, and, have, distracted, him, from, completing, his, own, new, opera, finally, on, 10, july, 1889, he, wrote, again, so, be, it, so, let, s, do, falstaff, for, now, let, s, not, think, of, obstacles, of, age, of, illnesses, verdi, emphasised, the, need, for, secrecy, but, continued, if, you, are, in, the, mood, then, start, to, write, later, he, wrote, to, boito, what, joy, to, be, able, to, say, to, the, public, here, we, are, again, come, and, see, us, the, first, performance, of, falstaff, took, place, at, la, scala, on, 9, february, 1893, for, the, first, night, official, ticket, prices, were, thirty, times, higher, than, usual, royalty, aristocracy, critics, and, leading, figures, from, the, arts, all, over, europe, were, present, the, performance, was, a, huge, success, numbers, were, encored, and, at, the, end, the, applause, for, verdi, and, the, cast, lasted, an, hour, that, was, followed, by, a, tumultuous, welcome, when, the, composer, his, wife, and, boito, arrived, at, the, grand, hotel, de, milan, even, more, hectic, scenes, ensued, when, he, went, to, rome, in, may, for, the, opera, s, premiere, at, the, teatro, costanzi, crowds, of, well, wishers, at, the, railway, station, initially, forced, verdi, to, take, refuge, in, a, tool, shed, he, witnessed, the, performance, from, the, royal, box, at, the, side, of, king, umberto, and, queen, margherita, in, his, last, years, verdi, undertook, a, number, of, philanthropic, ventures, publishing, in, 1894, a, song, for, the, benefit, of, earthquake, victims, in, sicily, and, from, 1895, onwards, planning, building, and, endowing, a, rest, home, for, retired, musicians, in, milan, the, casa, di, riposo, per, musicisti, and, building, a, hospital, at, villanova, sull, arda, close, to, busseto, his, last, major, composition, the, choral, set, of, four, sacred, pieces, was, published, in, 1898, in, 1900, he, was, deeply, upset, at, the, assassination, of, king, umberto, and, sketched, a, setting, of, a, poem, in, his, memory, but, was, unable, to, complete, it, while, staying, at, the, grand, hotel, verdi, suffered, a, stroke, on, 21, january, 1901, he, gradually, grew, more, feeble, over, the, next, week, during, which, stolz, cared, for, him, and, died, on, 27, january, at, the, age, of, 87, verdi, was, initially, buried, in, a, private, ceremony, at, milan, s, cimitero, monumentale, a, month, later, his, body, was, moved, to, the, crypt, of, the, casa, di, riposo, on, this, occasion, va, pensiero, from, nabucco, was, conducted, by, arturo, toscanini, with, a, chorus, of, 820, singers, a, huge, crowd, was, in, attendance, estimated, at, 300, 000, boito, wrote, to, a, friend, in, words, which, recall, the, mysterious, final, scene, of, don, carlos, sleeps, like, a, king, of, spain, in, his, escurial, under, a, bronze, slab, that, completely, covers, him, not, all, of, verdi, s, personal, qualities, were, amiable, john, rosselli, concluded, after, writing, his, biography, that, i, do, not, very, much, like, the, man, verdi, in, particular, the, autocratic, rentier, cum, estate, owner, part, time, composer, and, seemingly, full, time, grumbler, and, reactionary, critic, of, the,

unreasonable, or, wrong, budden, suggests, that, with, verdi, the, man, and, the, artist, in, many, ways, developed, side, by, side, ungainly, and, awkward, in, society, in, his, early, years, as, he, became, a, man, of, property, and, underwent, the, civilizing, influence, of, giuseppina, acquired, assurance, and, authority, he, also, learnt, to, keep, himself, to, himself, never, discussing, his, private, life, and, maintaining, when, it, suited, him, legends, about, his, supposed, peasant, origins, his, materialism, and, his, indifference, to, criticism, gerald, mendelsohn, describes, the, composer, as, an, intensely, private, man, who, deeply, resented, efforts, to, inquire, into, his, personal, affairs, he, regarded, journalists, and, would, be, biographers, as, well, as, his, neighbours, in, busseto, and, the, operatic, public, at, large, as, an, intrusive, lot, against, whose, prying, attentions, he, needed, constantly, to, defend, himself, verdi, was, never, explicit, about, his, religious, beliefs, anti, clerical, by, nature, in, his, early, years, he, nonetheless, built, a, chapel, at, sant, agata, but, is, little, recorded, as, attending, church, strepponi, wrote, in, 1871, i, won, t, say, is, an, atheist, but, he, is, not, much, of, a, believer, rosselli, comments, that, in, the, requiem, the, prospect, of, hell, appears, to, rule, is, troubled, to,

change, the, tastes, of, their, audiences, in, conversation, with, a, german, visitor, in, 1887, he, is, recorded, as, saying, that, whilst, there, was, much, to, be, admired, in, tannh, user, and, lohengrin, in, his, recent, operas, seemed, to, be, overstepping, the, bounds, of, what, can, be, expressed, in, music, for, him, philosophical, music, was, incomprehensible, although, verdi, s, works, belong, as, rosselli, admits, to, the, most, artificial, of, genres, ring, emotionally, true, truth, and, directness, make, them, exciting, often, hugely, so, the, earliest, study, of, verdi, s, music, published, in, 1859, by, the, italian, critic, abramo, basevi, already, distinguished, four, periods, in, verdi, s, music, the, early, grandiose, period, ended, according, to, basevi, with, la, battaglia, di, legnano, 1849, and, a, personal, style, began, with, the, next, opera, luisa, miller, these, two, operas, are, generally, agreed, today, by, critics, to, mark, the, division, between, verdi, s, early, and, middle, periods, the, middle, period, is, felt, to, end, with, la, traviata, 1853, and, les, v, pres, siciliennes, 1855, with, a, late, period, commencing, with, simon, boccanegra, 1857, running, through, to, aida, 1871, the, last, two, operas, otello, and, falstaff, together, with, the, requiem, and, the, four, sacred, pieces, then, represent, a, final, period, verdi, was, to, claim, in, his, sketch, that, during, his, early, training, with, lavigna, i, did, nothing, but, canons, and, fugues, no, one, taught, me, orchestration, or, how, to, handle, dramatic, music, he, is, known, to, have, written, a, variety, of, music, for, the, busseto, philharmonic, society, including, vocal, music, band, music, and, chamber, works, and, including, an, alternative, overture, to, rossini, s, barber, of, seville, but, few, of, these, works, survive, he, may, have, given, instructions, before, his, death, to, destroy, his, early, works, verdi, uses, in, his, early, operas, and, in, his, own, stylized, versions, throughout, his, later, work, the, standard, elements, of, italian, opera, content, of, the, period, referred, to, by, the, opera, writer, julian, budden, as, the, code, rossini, after, the, composer, who, established, through, his, work, and, popularity, the, accepted, templates, of, these, forms, they, were, also, used, by, the, composers, dominant, during, verdi, s, early, career, bellini, donizetti, and, saverio, mercadante, amongst, the, essential, elements, are, the, aria, the, duet, the, ensemble, and, the, finale, sequence, of, an, act, the, aria, format, centred, on, a, soloist, typically, involved, three, sections, a, slow, introduction, marked, typically, cantabile, or, adagio, a, tempo, di, mezzo, which, might, involve, chorus, or, other, characters, and, a, cabaletta, an, opportunity, for, bravura, singing, for, the, soloist, the, duet, was, similarly, formatted, finales, covering, climactic, sequences, of, action, used, the, various, forces, of, soloists, ensemble, and, chorus, usually, culminating, with, an, exciting, stretto, section, verdi, was, to, develop, these, and, the, other, formulae, of, the, generation, preceding, him, with, increasing, sophistication, during, his, career, the, operas, of, the, early, period, show, verdi, learning, by, doing, and, gradually, establishing, mastery, over, the, different, elements, of, opera, oberto, is, poorly, structured, and, the, orchestration, of, the, first, operas, is, generally, simple, sometimes, even, basic, the, musicologist, richard, taruskin, suggested, the, most, striking, effect, in, the, early, verdi, operas, and, the, one, most, obviously, allied, to, the, mood, of, the, risorgimento, was, the, big, choral, number, sung, crudely, or, sublimely, according, to, the, ear, of, the, beholder, in, unison, the, success, of, va, pensiero, in, nabucco, which, rossini, approvingly, denoted, as, a, grand, aria, sung, by, sopranos, contraltos, tenors, and, basses, was, replicated, in, the, similar, o, signor, dal, tetto, natio, in, i, lombardi, and, in, 1844, in, the, chorus, si, ridesti, il, leon, di, castiglia, in, ernani, the, battle, hymn, of, the, conspirators, seeking, freedom, in, i, due, foscari, verdi, first, uses, recurring, themes, identified, with, main, characters, here, and, in, future, operas, the, accent, moves, away, from, the, oratorio, characteristics, of, the, first, operas, towards, individual, action, and, intrigue, from, this, period, onwards, verdi, also, develops, his, instinct, for, tinta, literally, colour, a, term, which, he, used, for, characterising, elements, of, an, individual, opera, score, parker, gives, as, an, example, the, rising, 6th, that, begins, so, many, lyric, pieces, in, ernani, macbeth, even, in, its, original, 1847, version, shows, many, original, touches, characterization, by, key, the, macbeths, themselves, generally, singing, in, sharp, keys, the, witches, in, flat, keys, a, preponderance, of, minor, key, music, and, highly, original, orchestration, in, the, dagger, scene, and, the, duet, following, the, murder, of, duncan, the, forms, transcend, the, code, rossini, and, compellingly, propel, the, drama, verdi, was, to, comment, in, 1868, that, rossini, and, his, followers, missed, the, golden, thread, that, binds, all, the, parts, together, and, rather, than, a, set, of, numbers, without, coherence, makes, an, opera, tinta, was, for, verdi, this, golden, thread, an, essential, unifying, factor, in, his, works, the, writer, david, kimbell, states, that, in, luisa, miller, and, stiffelio, the, earliest, operas, of, this, period, there, appears, to, be, a, growing, freedom, in, the, large, scale, structure, and, an, acute, attention, to, fine, detail, others, echo, those, feelings, julian, budden, expresses, the, impact, of, rigoletto, and, its, place, in, verdi, s, output, as, follows, just, after, 1850, at, the, age, of, 38, verdi, closed, the, door, on, a, period, of, italian, opera, with, rigoletto, the, so, called, ottocento, in, music, is, finished, verdi, will, continue, to, draw, on, certain, of, its, forms, for, the, next, few, operas, but, in, a, totally, new, spirit, one, example, of, verdi, s, wish, to, move, away, from, standard, forms, appears, in, his, feelings, about, the, structure, of, il, trovatore, to, his, librettist, cammarano, verdi, plainly, states, in, a, letter, of, april, 1851, that, if, there, were, no, standard, forms, cavatinas, duets, trios, choruses, finales, etc, and, if, you, could, avoid, beginning, with, an, opening, chorus, he, would, be, quite, happy, two, external, factors, had, their, impacts, on, verdi, s, compositions, of, this, period, one, is, that, with, increasing, reputation, and, financial, security, he, no, longer, needed, to, commit, himself, to, the, productive, treadmill, had, more, freedom, to, choose, his, own, subjects, and, had, more, time, to, develop, them, according, to, his, own, ideas, in, the, years, 1849, to, 1859, he, wrote, eight, new, operas, compared, with, fourteen, in, the, previous, ten, years, another, factor, was, the, changed, political, situation, the, failure, of, the, 1848, revolutions, led, both, to, some, diminution, of, the, risorgimento, ethos, at, least, initially, and, a, significant, increase, in, theatre, censorship, this, is, reflected, both, in, verdi, s, choices, of, plots, dealing, more, with, personal, relationships, than, political, conflict, and, in, a, partly, consequent, dramatic, reduction, in, the, operas, of, this, period, in, the, number, of, choruses, of, the, type, which, had, first, made, him, famous, not, only, are, there, on, average, 40, fewer, choruses, in, the, middle, period, operas, compared, to, the, early, period, but, whereas, virtually, all, the, early, operas, commence, with, a, chorus, only, one, luisa, miller, of, the, middle, period, operas, begin, this, way, instead, verdi, experiments, with, a, variety, of, means, e, g, a, stage, band, rigoletto, an, aria, for, bass, stiffelio, a, party, scene, la, traviata, chusid, also, notes, verdi, s, increasing, tendency, to, replace, full, scale, overtures, with, shorter, orchestral, introductions, parker, comments, that, la, traviata, the, last, opera, of, the, middle, period, is, again, a, new, adventure, it, gestures, towards, a, level, of, realism, the, contemporary, world, of, waltzes, pervades, the, score, and, the, heroine, s, death, from, disease, is, graphically, depicted, in, the, music, verdi, s, increasing, command, of, musical, highlighting, of, changing, moods, and, relationships, is, exemplified, in, act, 3, of, rigoletto, where, duke, s, flippant, song, la, donna, mobile, is, followed, immediately, by, the, quartet, bella, figlia, dell, amore, contrasting, the, rapacious, duke, and, his, inamorata, with, the, concealed, indignant, rigoletto, and, his, grieving, daughter, taruskin, asserts, this, is, the, most, famous, ensemble, verdi, ever, composed, chusid, notes, strepponi, s, description, of, the, operas, of, the, 1860s, and, 1870s, as, being, modern, whereas, verdi, described, the, pre, 1849, works, as, the, cavatina, operas, as, further, indication, that, verdi, became, increasingly, dissatisfied, with, the, older, familiar, conventions, of, his, predecessors, that, he, had, adopted, at, the, outset, of, his, career, parker, sees, a, physical, differentiation, of, the, operas, from, les, v, pres, siciliennes, 1855, to, aida, 1871, is, that, they, are, significantly, longer, and, with, larger, cast, lists, than, previous, works, they, also, reflect, a, shift, towards, the, french, genre, of, grand, opera, notable, in, more, colourful, orchestration, counterpointing, of, serious, and, comic, scenes, and, greater, spectacle, the, opportunities, of, transforming, italian, opera, by, utilising, such, resources, appealed, to, him, for, a, commission, from, the, paris, op, ra, he, expressly, demanded, a, libretto, from, eug, ne, scribe, the, favourite, librettist, of, meyerbeer, telling, him, i, want, in, fact, i, must, have, a, grandiose, impassioned, and, original, subject, the, result, was, les, v, pres, siciliennes, and, the, scenarios, of, simon, boccanegra, 1857, un, ballo, in, maschera, 1859, la, forza, del, destino, 1862, don, carlos, 1867, and, aida, 1871, all, meet, the, same, criteria, porter, notes, that, un, ballo, marks, an, almost, complete, synthesis, of, verdi, s, style, with, the, grand, opera, hallmarks, such, that, huge, spectacle, is, not, mere, decoration, but, essential, to, the, drama, musical, and, theatrical, lines, remain, taut, the, characters, still, sing, as, warmly, passionately, and, personally, as, in, il, trovatore, when, the, composer, ferdinand, hiller, asked, verdi, whether, he, preferred, aida, or, don, carlos, verdi, replied, that, aida, had, more, bite, and, if, you, ll, forgive, the, word, more, theatricality, during, the, rehearsals, for, the, naples, production, of, aida, verdi, amused, himself, by, writing, his, only, string, quartet, a, sprightly, work, which, shows, in, its, last, movement, that, he, had, not, lost, the, skill, for, fugue, writing, that, he, had, learned, with, lavigna, verdi, s, three, last, major, works, continued, to, show, new, developments, in, conveying, drama, and, emotion, the, first, to, appear, in, 1874, was, his, requiem, scored, for, operatic, forces, but, by, no, means, an, opera, in, ecclesiastical, dress, the, words, in, which, hans, von, b, low, condemned, it, before, even, hearing, it, although, in, the, requiem, verdi, puts, to, use, many, of, the, techniques, he, learned, in, opera, its, musical, forms, and, emotions, are, not, those, of, the, stage, verdi, s, tone, painting, at, the, opening, of, the, requiem, is, vividly, described, by, the, italian, composer, ildebrando, pizzetti, writing, in, 1941, in, murmured, by, an, invisible, crowd, over, the, slow, swaying, of, a, few, simple, chords, you, straightaway, sense, the, fear, and, sadness, of, a, vast, multitude, before, the, mystery, of, death, in, the, et, lux, perpetuum, the, melody, spreads, it, wings, before, falling, back, on, itself, you, hear, a, sigh, for, consolation, and, eternal, peace, by, the, time, otello, premi, red, in, 1887, more, than, 15, years, after, aida, the, operas, of, verdi, s, predeceased, contemporary, richard, wagner, had, begun, their, ascendancy, in, popular, taste, and, many, sought, or, identified, wagnerian, aspects, in, verdi, s, latest, composition, budden, points, out, that, there, is, little, in, the, music, of, otello, that, relates, either, to, the, verismo, opera, of, the, younger, italian, composers, and, little, if, anything, which, can, be, construed, as, a, homage, to, the, new, german, school, nonetheless, there, is, still, much, originality, building, on, the, strengths, which, verdi, had, already, demonstrated, the, powerful, storm, which, opens, the, opera, in, medias, res, the, recollection, of, the, love, duet, of, act, i, in, otello, s, dying, words, more, an, aspect, of, tinta, than, leitmotif, imaginative, touches, of, harmony, in, iago, s, era, la, notte, act, ii, finally, six, years, later, appeared, falstaff, verdi, s, only, comedy, apart, from, the, early, ill, fated, un, giorno, di, regno, in, this, work, roger, parker, writes, that, although, verdi, s, operas, brought, him, a, popular, following, not, all, contemporary, critics, approved, of, his, work, the, english, critic, henry, chorley, allowed, in, 1846, that, he, is, the, only, modern, man, having, a, style, for, better, or, worse, but, found, all, his, output, unacceptable, faults, grave, ones, calculated, to, destroy, and, degrade, taste, beyond, those, of, any, italian, composer, in, the, long, list, wrote, chorley, whilst, conceding, that, howsoever, incomplete, may, have, been, his, training, howsoever, mistaken, his, aspirations, may, have, proved, he, has, aspired, but, by, the, time, of, verdi, s, death, 55, years, later, his, reputation, was, assured, and, the, 1910, edition, of, grove, s, dictionary, pronounced, him, one, of, the, greatest, and, most, popular, opera, composers, of, the, nineteenth, century, verdi, had, no, pupils, apart, from, muzio, and, no, school, of, composers, sought, to, follow, his, style, by, his, death, verismo, was, the, accepted, style, of, young, italian, composers, the, new, york, metropolitan, opera, frequently, staged, rigoletto, trovatore, and, traviata, during, this, period, and, featured, aida, in, every, season, from, 1898, to, 1945, interest, in, the, operas, reawakened, in, mid, 1920s, germany, and, this, sparked, a, revival, in, england, and, elsewhere, from, the, 1930s, onward, there, began, to, appear, scholarly, biographies, and, publications, of, documentation, and, correspondence, in, 1959, the, instituto, di, studi, verdiani, from, 1989, the, istituto, nazionale, di, studi, verdiani, was, founded, in, parma, and, became, a, leading, centre, for, research, and, publication, of, verdi, studies, and, in, the, 1970s, the, american, institute, for, verdi, studies, was, founded, at, new, york, university, historians, have, debated, how, political, verdi, s, operas, were, in, particular, the, chorus, of, the, hebrew, slaves, known, as, va, pensiero, from, the, third, act, of, the, opera, nabucco, was, used, an, anthem, for, italian, patriots, who, were, seeking, to, unify, their, country, and, free, it, from, foreign, control, in, the, years, up, to, 1861, the, chorus, s, theme, of, exiles, singing, about, their, homeland, and, its, lines, such, as, o, mia, patria, si, bella, e, perduta, o, my, country, so, lovely, and, so, lost, were, thought, to, have, resonated, with, many, italians, beginning, in, naples, in, 1859, and, spreading, throughout, italy, the, slogan, viva, verdi, was, used, as, an, acronym, for, viva, v, ittorio, e, manuele, r, e, d, i, talia, long, live, victor, emmanuel, king, of, italy, referring, to, victor, emmanuel, ii, marco, pizzo, argues, that, after, 1815, music, became, a, political, tool, and, many, songwriters, expressed, ideals, of, freedom, and, equality, pizzo, claims, that, verdi, was, part, of, this, movement, for, his, operas, were, inspired, by, the, love, of, country, the, struggle, for, italian, independence, and, spoke, to, the, sacrifice, of, patriots, and, exiles, george, martin, claims, verdi, was, the, greatest, artist, of, the, risorgimento, throughout, his, work, its, values, its, issues, recur, constantly, and, he, expressed, them, with, great, power, but, mary, ann, smart, argues, that, music, critics, at, the, time, seldom, mentioned, any, political, themes, likewise, roger, parker, argues, that, the, political, dimension, of, verdi, s, operas, was, exaggerated, by, nationalistic, historians, in, the, late, 19th, century, from, the, 1850s, onwards, verdi, s, operas, displayed, few, patriotic, themes, because, of, the, heavy, censorship, by, the, absolutist, regime, in, power, verdi, later, became, disillusioned, by, politics, but, he, was, personally, active, part, in, the, political, world, of, events, of, the, risorgimento, and, was, elected, to, the, first, italian, parliament, in, 1861, three, italian, conservatories, the, milan, conservatory, and, those, in, turin, and, como, are, named, after, verdi, as, are, many, italian,
