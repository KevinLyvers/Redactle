skirmishes, with, hostile, natives, one, of, which, caused, almagro, to, lose, an, eye, by, arrow, shot, the, place, names, the, spanish, bestowed, along, their, route, including, puerto, deseado, desired, port, puerto, del, hambre, port, of, hunger, and, punta, quemado, or, puebla, quemado, burned, port, confirmed, their, difficulties, fearing, subsequent, hostile, encounters, like, the, one,

arrive, and, succeed, d, vila, pedro, de, los, r, os, took, charge, as, the, new, colonial, administrator, in, july, 1526, and, initially, approved, pizarro, s, expeditions, he, would, join, him,

soon, after, arriving, the, party, separated, with, pizarro, staying, to, explore, the, new, and, often, perilous, territory, off, the, swampy, colombian, coasts, while, the, expedition, s, co, commander, almagro, returned, to, panama, for, reinforcements, pizarro, s, piloto, mayor, main, pilot, bartolom, ruiz, continued, sailing, south, and, after, crossing, the, equator, found, and,

the, san, juan, river, arriving, to, find, pizarro, and, his, men, exhausted, from, the, difficulties, they, had, faced, exploring, the, new, territory, soon, almagro, sailed, into, the, port, laden, with, supplies, and, a, reinforcement, of, at, least, eighty, recruits, who, had, arrived, at, panama, from, spain, with, an, expeditionary, spirit, the, findings, and, excellent, news, from, ruiz, along, with, almagro, s, new, reinforcements, cheered, pizarro, and, his, tired, followers, they, decided, to, sail, back, to, the, territory, already, explored, by, ruiz, and, after, a, difficult, voyage, due, to, strong, winds, and, currents, reached, atacames, on, the, ecuadorian, coast, here, they, found, a, large, native, population, recently, brought, under, inca, rule, unfortunately, for, the, conquistadores, the, people, they, encountered, seemed, so, defiant, and, numerous, that, the, spanish, decided, not, to, enter, the, land, 110, 12, after, much, wrangling, between, pizarro, and, almagro, it, was, decided, that, pizarro, would, stay, at, a, safer, place, the, isla, de, gallo, 25, 26, near, the, coast, while, almagro, would, return, to, panama, with, luque, for, more, reinforcements, this, time, with, proof, of, the, gold, they, had, found, and, the, news, of, the, discovery, of, the, obviously, wealthy, land, they, had, explored, the, new, governor, of, panama, pedro, de, los, r, os, had, learned, of, the, mishaps, of, pizarro, s, expeditions, and, the, deaths, of, various, settlers, who, had, gone, with, him, fearing, an, unsuccessful, outcome, he, rejected, almagro, s, application, for, continued, resources, in, addition, he, ordered, two, ships, commanded, by, juan, tafur, to, be, sent, immediately, with, the, intention, of, bringing, pizarro, and, his, crew, back, to, panama, 112, 15, pizarro, had, no, intention, of, returning, and, when, tafur, arrived, at, isla, de, gallo, pizarro, drew, a, line, in, the, sand, saying, there, lies, peru, with, its, riches, here, panama, and, its, poverty, choose, each, man, what, best, becomes, a, brave, castilian, for, my, part, i, go, to, the, south, 116, only, 13, men, stayed, with, pizarro, they, later, became, known, as, the, famous, thirteen, los, trece, de, la, fama, 26, while, the, rest, of, the, expeditioners, stayed, with, tafur, ruiz, left, in, one, of, the, ships, with, the, intention, of, joining, almagro, and, luque, in, their, efforts, to, gather, reinforcements, soon, after, the, ships, left, pizarro, and, his, men, constructed, a, crude, boat, and, journeyed, 25, leagues, north, to, la, isla, gorgona, where, they, would, remain, for, seven, months, before, the, arrival, of, new, provisions, 117, 18, back, in, panama, pedro, de, los, r, os, after, much, convincing, by, luque, had, finally, acquiesced, to, the, requests, for, another, ship, but, only, to, bring, pizarro, back, within, six, months, and, completely, abandon, the, expedition, almagro, and, luque, grasped, the, opportunity, and, left, panama, this, time, without, new, recruits, for, la, isla, gorgona, to, once, again, join, pizarro, on, meeting, with, pizarro, the, associates, decided, to, continue, sailing, south, on, the, recommendations, of, ruiz, s, indian, interpreters, 118, by, april, 1528, they, finally, reached, the, northwestern, peruvian, tumbes, region, tumbes, became, the, first, success, the, spanish, had, so, long, desired, they, were, received, with, a, warm, welcome, of, hospitality, and, provisions, from, the, tumpis, the, local, inhabitants, on, subsequent, days, two, of, pizarro, s, men, alonso, de, molina, and, pedro, de, candia, reconnoitred, the, territory, and, both, on, separate, accounts, reported, back, the, riches, of, the, land, including, the, decorations, of, silver, and, gold, around, the, chief, s, residence, and, the, hospitable, attentions, with, which, they, were, received, by, everyone, the, spanish, also, saw, for, the, first, time, the, peruvian, llama, 26, which, pizarro, called, little, camels, pizarro, continued, receiving, the, same, accounts, of, a, powerful, monarch, who, ruled, over, the, land, they, were, exploring, these, events, served, as, evidence, to, convince, the, expedition, that, the, wealth, and, power, displayed, at, tumbes, were, an, example, of, the, riches, of, the, peruvian, territory, the, conquistadors, decided, to, return, to, panama, to, prepare, the, final, expedition, of, conquest, with, more, recruits, and, provisions, before, leaving, however, pizarro, and, his, followers, sailed, south, along, the, coast, to, see, if, anything, of, interest, could, be, found, historian, william, h, prescott, recounts, that, after, passing, through, territories, they, named, such, as, cabo, blanco, port, of, payta, sechura, punta, de, aguja, santa, cruz, and, trujillo, founded, by, almagro, years, later, they, finally, reached, for, the, first, time, the, ninth, degree, of, the, southern, latitude, in, south, america, on, their, return, towards, panama, pizarro, briefly, stopped, at, tumbes, where, two, of, his, men, had, decided, to, stay, to, learn, the, customs, and, language, of, the, natives, pizarro, was, also, given, two, peruvian, boys, to, learn, spanish, one, of, whom, was, later, baptized, as, felipillo, and, served, as, an, important, interpreter, the, equivalent, of, cort, s, la, malinche, of, mexico, and, another, called, martinillo, 126, 128, their, final, stop, was, at, la, isla, gorgona, where, two, of, his, ill, men, one, had, died, had, stayed, after, at, least, 18, months, away, pizarro, and, his, followers, anchored, off, the, coasts, of, panama, to, prepare, for, the, final, expedition, 119, 26, when, the, new, governor, of, panama, pedro, de, los, r, os, refused, to, allow, for, a, third, expedition, to, the, south, the, associates, resolved, for, pizarro, to, leave, for, spain, and, appeal, to, the, sovereign, in, person, pizarro, sailed, from, panama, for, spain, in, the, spring, of, 1528, accompanied, by, pedro, de, candia, some, natives, and, llamas, plus, samples, of, fabric, gold, and, silver, 127, 28, pizarro, reached, seville, in, early, summer, king, charles, i, who, was, at, toledo, had, an, interview, with, pizarro, and, heard, of, his, expeditions, in, south, america, the, conquistador, described, the, territory, as, rich, in, gold, and, silver, that, he, and, his, followers, had, bravely, explored, to, extend, the, empire, of, castile, the, king, who, was, soon, to, leave, for, italy, was, impressed, at, his, accounts, and, promised, his, support, for, the, conquest, of, peru, queen, isabel, though, in, the, absence, of, the, king, signed, the, capitulaci, n, de, toledo, on, 6, july, 1529, a, license, document, that, authorized, pizarro, to, proceed, with, the, conquest, of, peru, pizarro, was, officially, named, the, governor, captain, general, adelantado, and, alguacil, mayor, of, new, castile, for, the, distance, of, 200, leagues, along, the, newly, discovered, coast, and, invested, with, all, authority, and, prerogatives, leaving, his, associates, in, secondary, positions, a, fact, that, later, incensed, almagro, and, would, lead, to, eventual, discord, one, of, the, grant, conditions, was, that, within, six, months, pizarro, should, raise, a, sufficiently, equipped, force, of, 250, men, of, whom, 100, might, be, drawn, from, the, colonies, 132, 34, 137, this, gave, pizarro, time, to, leave, for, his, native, trujillo, and, convince, his, brother, hernando, pizarro, and, other, close, friends, to, join, him, on, his, third, expedition, 136, francisco, de, orellana, joined, the, group, and, would, later, discover, and, explore, the, length, of,

soon, arrived, with, 30, men, 141, though, pizarro, s, main, objective, was, then, to, set, sail, and, dock, at, tumbes, like, his, previous, expedition, he, was, forced, to, confront, the, punian, natives, in, the, battle, of, pun, leaving, three, or, four, spaniards, dead, and, many, wounded, soon, after, hernando, de, soto, another, conquistador, who, had, joined, the, expedition, arrived, with, 100, volunteers, and, horses, to, aid, pizarro, and, with, him, sailed, towards, tumbes, 143, only, to, find, the, place, deserted, and, destroyed, the, two, conquistadors, expected, that, the, settlers, had, disappeared, or, died, under, murky, circumstances, the, chiefs, explained, that, the, fierce, tribes, of, punians, had, attacked, them, and, ransacked, the, place, 152, 53, as, tumbes,

in, his, cajamarca, plaza, fortress, the, next, day, fray, vincente, de, valverde, and, native, interpreter, felipillo, approached, atahualpa, in, cajamarca, s, central, plaza, after, the, dominican, friar, expounded, the, true, faith, and, the, need, to, pay, tribute, to, the, emperor, charles, v, atahualpa, replied, i, will, be, no, man, s, tributary, his, complacency, because, fewer, than, 200, spanish, remained, as, opposed, to, his, 50, 000, man, army, of, which, 6, 000, accompanied, him, to, cajamarca, sealed, his, fate, and, that, of, the, inca, empire, 157, 161, 166, 77, atahualpa, s, refusal, led, pizarro, and, his, force, to, attack, the, inca, army, in, what, became, the, battle, of, cajamarca, on, 16, november, 1532, the, spanish, were, successful, pizarro, executed, atahualpa,

including, killing, his, brother, and, plotting, against, pizarro, and, his, forces, he, was, executed, by, garrote, on, 29, august, 1533, francisco, pizarro, and, de, soto, were, opposed, to, atahualpa, s, execution, but, francisco, consented, to, the, trial, due, to, the, great, agitation, among, the, soldiers, particularly, by, almagro, de, soto, was, on, a, reconnaissance, mission, the, day, of, the, trial, and, execution, and, upon, his, return, expressed, his, dismay, stating, he, should, have, been, taken, to, castile, and, judged, by, the, emperor, 202, 04, 206, king, charles, later, wrote, to, pizarro, we, have, been, displeased, by, the, death, of, atahualpa, since, he, was, a, monarch, and, particularly, as, it, was, done, in, the, name, of, justice, pizarro, advanced, with, his, army, of, 500, spaniards, toward, cuzco, accompanied, by, chalcuchimac, one, of, the, leading, inca, generals, of, the, north, and, a, supporter, of, atahualpa, who, was, subsequently, burned, at, the, stake, manco, inca, yupanqui, joined, pizarro, after, the, death, of, t, pac, huallpa, 191, 210, 216, during, the, exploration, of, cuzco, pizarro, was, impressed, and, through, his, officers, wrote, back, to, king, charles, i, of, spain, saying, this, city, is, the, greatest, and, the, finest, ever, seen, in, this, country, or, anywhere, in, the, indies, we, can, assure, your, majesty, that, it, is, so, beautiful, and, has, such, fine, buildings, that, it, would, be, remarkable, even, in, spain, the, spanish, sealed, the, conquest, of, peru, by, entering, cuzco, on, 15, november, 1533, 216, jauja, in, the, fertile, mantaro, valley, was, established, as, peru, s, provisional, capital, in, april, 1534, 286, but, it, was, high, up, in, the, mountains, and, too, distant, from, the, sea, to, serve, as, the, capital, pizarro, founded, the, city, of, lima, on, peru, s, central, coast, on, 6, january, 1535, which, he, considered, to, be, one, of, the, most, important, things, he, had, created, in, life, 227, 29, by, early, 1536, manco, inka, supported, by, an, army, of, perhaps, 100, 000, people, initiated, a, siege, of, cuzco, at, the, same, time, smaller, incan, expeditionary, forces, moved, to, destroy, other, european, strongholds, in, the, three, years, of, continuous, warfare, since, the, arrival, of, pizarro, incan, military, leaders, had, become, familiar, with, spanish, military, tactics, and, developed, effective, counters, perhaps, the, most, effective, of, these, military, innovations, was, the, one, that, dealt, with, the, europeans, greatest, advantage, on, the, battlefield, horses, incan, soldiers, would, offer, battle, but, hold, their, position, until, the, spaniards, had, concentrated, their, cavalry, in, order, to, break, the, indigenous, line, they, would, then, fall, back, before, the, cavalry, charge, and, draw, the, europeans, into, a, canyon, where, prepositioned, forces, could, crush, them, under, avalanches, of, rocks, and, missile, weapons, instead, of, charging, the, numerically, inferior, europeans, as, they, had, done, early, on, incan, soldiers, used, their, discipline, and, knowledge, of, the, terrain, in, order, to, draw, the, armoured, cavalry, charge, into, a, death, trap, well, documented, battlefield, deaths, show, that, many, more, spaniards, died, in, these, battles, than, in, the, early, days, of, the, war, when, theoretically, the, inca, had, a, much, greater, advantage, despite, winning, the, majority, of, the, battles, the, inability, of, the, incan, forces, to, overwhelm, cuzco, s, fortifications, manned, as, they, were, by, only, 200, fighting, men, armed, with, gunpowder, weapons, signalled, the, definitive, victory, of, spanish, forces, after, the, final, effort, of, the, inca, to, recover, cuzco, had, been, defeated, by, almagro, a, dispute, occurred, between, pizarro, and, almagro, respecting, the, limits, of, their, jurisdiction, as, both, claimed, the, city, of, cuzco, the, king, of, spain, had, awarded, the, governorate, of, new, toledo, to, almagro, and, the, governorate, of, new, castile, to, pizarro, the, dispute, had, originated, from, a, disagreement, on, how, to, interpret, the, limit, between, the, governorates, 254, 56, this, led, to, confrontations, between, the, pizarro, brothers, and, almagro, who, was, eventually, defeated, during, the, battle, of, las, salinas, 1538, and, executed, almagro, s, son, also, named, diego, and, known, as, el, mozo, was, later, stripped, of, his, lands, and, left, bankrupt, by, pizarro, atahualpa, s, wife, 10, year, old, cuxirimay, ocllo, yupanqui, was, with, atahualpa, s, army, in, cajamarca, and, had, stayed, with, him, while, he, was, imprisoned, following, his, execution, she, was, taken, to, cuzco, given, the, name, do, a, angelina, and, made, the, concubine, of, francisco, pizarro, by, 1538, it, was, known, she, had, borne, pizarro, two, sons, juan, and, francisco, in, lima, on, 26, june, 1541, a, group, of, 20, heavily, armed, supporters, of, diego, de, almagro, ii, el, mozo, stormed, pizarro, s, palace, assassinating, him, and, then, forcing, the, terrified, city, council, to, appoint, young, almagro, as, the, new, governor, of, peru, most, of, pizarro, s, guests, fled, but, a, few, fought, the, intruders, numbered, variously, between, seven, and, 25, while, pizarro, struggled, to, buckle, on, his, breastplate, his, defenders, including, his, half, brother, mart, n, de, alc, ntara, were, killed, 143, for, his, part, pizarro, killed, two, attackers, and, ran, through, a, third, a, contemporary, chronicler, agust, n, de, z, rate, wrote, that, pizarro, fought, until, he, was, too, exhausted, to, brandish, his, sword, and, then, was, struck, fatally, in, the, throat, when, he, fell, to, the, ground, he, reportedly, drew, a, cross, on, the, floor, with, his, blood, and, kissed, it, before, dying, a, modern, forensic, examination, of, his, remains, indicated, that, pizarro, had, been, savagely, attacked, with, multiple, stab, wounds, to, his, head, and, neck, as, well, as, defensive, wounds, to, his, hands, and, arms, pizarro, s, remains, were, briefly, interred, in, the, cathedral, courtyard, at, some, later, time, his, head, and, body, were, separated, and, buried, in, separate, boxes, underneath, the, floor, of, the, cathedral, in, 1892, in, preparation, for, the, anniversary, of, columbus, discovery, of, the, americas, a, body, believed, to, be, that, of, pizarro, was, exhumed, and, put, on, display, in, a, glass, coffin, however, in, 1977, men, working, on, the, cathedral, s, foundation, discovered, a, lead, box, in, a, sealed, niche, which, bore, the, inscription, here, is, the, head, of, marquess, don, francisco, pizarro, who, discovered, and, conquered, the, kingdoms, of, peru, and, presented, them, to, the, crown, of, castile, a, team, of, forensic, scientists, from, the, united, states, led, by, william, r, maples, was, invited, to, examine, the, two, bodies, and, they, soon, determined, that, the, body, which, had, been, honored, in, the, glass, case, for, nearly, a, century, had, been, incorrectly, identified, the, skull, within, the, lead, box, not, only, bore, the, marks, of, multiple, sword, blows, but, the, features, bore, a, remarkable, resemblance, to, portraits, made, of, the, man, in, life, by, his, marriage, to, quispe, sisa, pizarro, had, a, son, also, named, francisco, who, married, his, relative, in, s, pizarro, without, issue, after, pizarro, s, death, in, s, yupanqui, whom, he, took, as, a, mistress, inca, princess, and, favourite, sister, of, atahualpa, who, had, been, given, to, francisco, in, marriage, by, her, brother, married, a, spanish, cavalier, named, ampuero, and, left, for,

1537, the, third, son, of, pizarro, who, was, never, legitimized, francisco, by, dona, angelina, a, wife, of, atahualpa, that, he, had, taken, as, a, mistress, died, shortly, after, reaching, spain, after, his, invasion, pizarro, destroyed, the, inca, state, and, while, ruling, the, area, for, almost, a, decade, initiated, the, decline, of, local, cultures, the, incas, polytheistic, religion, was, replaced, by, christianity, and, much, of, the, local, population, was, reduced, to, serfdom, under, the, spanish, elite, the, cities, of, the, inca, empire, were, transformed, into, spanish, catholic, cities, pizarro, is, also, reviled, for, ordering, atawallpa, s, death, despite, the, ransom, payment, which, pizarro, kept, after, paying, the, spanish, king, his, due, some, peruvians, particularly, those, of, indigenous, descent, may, regard, him, negatively, although, until, relatively, recently, pizarro, had, been, portrayed, positively, for, instance, in, textbooks, for, introducing, catholicism, and, creating, a, privileged, class, of, mainly, spanish, descent, in, the, early, 1930s, sculptor, ramsay, macdonald, created, three, copies, of, an, anonymous, european,
