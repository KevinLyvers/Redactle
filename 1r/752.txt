giordano, bruno, d, r, d, n, o, b, r, u, n, o, italian, latin, iordanus, brunus, nolanus, born, filippo, bruno, january, or, february, 1548, 17, february, 1600, was, an, italian, philosopher, poet, alchemist, astronomer, cosmological, theorist, and, esotericist, he, is, known, for, his, cosmological, theories, which, conceptually, extended, to, include, the, then, novel, copernican, model, he, practiced, hermeticism, and, gave, a, mystical, stance, to, exploring, the, universe, he, proposed, that, the, stars, were, distant, suns, surrounded, by, their, own, planets, exoplanets, and, he, raised, the, possibility, that, these, planets, might, foster, life, of, their, own, a, cosmological, position, known, as, cosmic, pluralism, he, also, insisted, that, the, universe, is, infinite, and, could, have, no, center, bruno, was, tried, for, heresy, by, the, roman, inquisition, on, charges, of, denial, of, several, core, catholic, doctrines, including, eternal, damnation, the, trinity, the, divinity, of, christ, the, virginity, of, mary, and, transubstantiation, bruno, s, pantheism, was, not, taken, lightly, by, the, church, nor, was, his, teaching, of, metempsychosis, regarding, the, reincarnation, of, the, soul, the, inquisition, found, him, guilty, and, he, was, burned, alive, at, the, stake, in, rome, s, campo, de, fiori, in, 1600, after, his, death, he, gained, considerable, fame, being, particularly, celebrated, by, 19th, and, early, 20th, century, commentators, who, regarded, him, as, a, martyr, for, science, some, historians, are, of, the, opinion, his, heresy, trial, was, not, a, response, to, his, cosmological, views, but, rather, a, response, to, his, religious, and, afterlife, views, while, others, find, the, main, reason, for, bruno, s, death, was, indeed, his, cosmological, views, bruno, s, case, is, still, considered, a, landmark, in, the, history, of, free, thought, and, the, emerging, sciences, in, addition, to, cosmology, bruno, also, wrote, extensively, on, the, art, of, memory, a, loosely, organized, group, of, mnemonic, techniques, and, principles, historian, frances, yates, argues, that, bruno, was, deeply, influenced, by, the, presocratic, empedocles, neoplatonism, renaissance, hermeticism, and, book, of, genesis, like, legends, surrounding, the, hellenistic, conception, of, hermes, trismegistus, other, studies, of, bruno, have, focused, on, his, qualitative, approach, to, mathematics, and, his, application, of, the, spatial, concepts, of, geometry, to, language, born, filippo, bruno, in, nola, a, comune, in, the, modern, day, province, of, naples, in, the, southern, italian, region, of, campania, then, part, of, the, kingdom, of, naples, in, 1548, he, was, the, son, of, giovanni, bruno, 1517, c, 1592, a, soldier, and, fraulissa, savolino, 1520, in, his, youth, he, was, sent, to, naples, to, be, educated, he, was, tutored, privately, at, the, augustinian, monastery, there, and, attended, public, lectures, at, the, studium, generale, at, the, age, of, 17, he, entered, the, dominican, order, at, the, monastery, of, san, domenico, maggiore, in, naples, taking, the, name, giordano, after, giordano, crispo, his, metaphysics, tutor, he, continued, his, studies, there, completing, his, novitiate, and, ordained, a, priest, in, 1572, at, age, 24, during, his, time, in, naples, he, became, known, for, his, skill, with, the, art, of, memory, and, on, one, occasion, traveled, to, rome, to, demonstrate, his, mnemonic, system, before, pope, pius, v, and, cardinal, rebiba, in, his, later, years, bruno, claimed, that, the, pope, accepted, his, dedication, to, him, of, the, lost, work, on, the, ark, of, noah, at, this, time, while, bruno, was, distinguished, for, outstanding, ability, his, taste, for, free, thinking, and, forbidden, books, soon, caused, him, difficulties, given, the, controversy, he, caused, in, later, life, it, is, surprising, that, he, was, able, to, remain, within, the, monastic, system, for, eleven, years, in, his, testimony, to, venetian, inquisitors, during, his, trial, many, years, later, he, says, that, proceedings, were, twice, taken, against, him, for, having, cast, away, images, of, the, saints, retaining, only, a, crucifix, and, for, having, recommended, controversial, texts, to, a, novice, such, behavior, could, perhaps, be, overlooked, but, bruno, s, situation, became, much, more, serious, when, he, was, reported, to, have, defended, the, arian, heresy, and, when, a, copy, of, the, banned, writings, of, erasmus, annotated, by, him, was, discovered, hidden, in, the, monastery, latrine, when, he, learned, that, an, indictment, was, being, prepared, against, him, in, naples, he, fled, shedding, his, religious, habit, at, least, for, a, time, bruno, first, went, to, the, genoese, port, of, noli, then, to, savona, turin, and, finally, to, venice, where, he, published, his, lost, work, on, the, signs, of, the, times, with, the, permission, so, he, claimed, at, his, trial, of, the, dominican, remigio, nannini, fiorentino, from, venice, he, went, to, padua, where, he, met, fellow, dominicans, who, convinced, him, to, wear, his, religious, habit, again, from, padua, he, went, to, bergamo, and, then, across, the, alps, to, chamb, ry, and, lyon, his, movements, after, this, time, are, obscure, in, 1579, bruno, arrived, in, geneva, during, his, venetian, trial, he, told, inquisitors, that, while, in, geneva, he, told, the, marchese, de, vico, of, naples, who, was, notable, for, helping, italian, refugees, in, geneva, i, did, not, intend, to, adopt, the, religion, of, the, city, i, desired, to, stay, there, only, that, i, might, live, at, liberty, and, in, security, bruno, had, a, pair, of, breeches, made, for, himself, and, the, marchese, and, others, apparently, made, bruno, a, gift, of, a, sword, hat, cape, and, other, necessities, for, dressing, himself, in, such, clothing, bruno, could, no, longer, be, recognized, as, a, priest, things, apparently, went, well, for, bruno, for, a, time, as, he, entered, his, name, in, the, rector, s, book, of, the, university, of, geneva, in, may, 1579, but, in, keeping, with, his, personality, he, could, not, long, remain, silent, in, august, he, published, an, attack, on, the, work, of, antoine, de, la, faye, a, distinguished, professor, bruno, and, the, printer, jean, bergeon, were, promptly, arrested, rather, than, apologizing, bruno, insisted, on, continuing, to, defend, his, publication, he, was, refused, the, right, to, take, sacrament, though, this, right, was, soon, restored, he, left, geneva, he, went, to, france, arriving, first, in, lyon, and, thereafter, settling, for, a, time, 1580, 1581, in, toulouse, where, he, took, his, doctorate, in, theology, and, was, elected, by, students, to, lecture, in, philosophy, he, also, attempted, at, this, time, to, return, to, catholicism, but, was, denied, absolution, by, the, jesuit, priest, he, approached, when, religious, strife, broke, out, in, the, summer, of, 1581, he, moved, to, paris, there, he, held, a, cycle, of, thirty, lectures, on, theological, topics, and, also, began, to, gain, fame, for, his, prodigious, memory, his, talents, attracted, the, benevolent, attention, of, the, king, henry, iii, bruno, subsequently, reported, i, got, me, such, a, name, that, king, henry, iii, summoned, me, one, day, to, discover, from, me, if, the, memory, which, i, possessed, was, natural, or, acquired, by, magic, art, i, satisfied, him, that, it, did, not, come, from, sorcery, but, from, organized, knowledge, and, following, this, i, got, a, book, on, memory, printed, entitled, the, shadows, of, ideas, which, i, dedicated, to, his, majesty, forthwith, he, gave, me, an, extraordinary, lectureship, with, a, salary, in, paris, bruno, enjoyed, the, protection, of, his, powerful, french, patrons, during, this, period, he, published, several, works, on, mnemonics, including, de, umbris, idearum, on, the, shadows, of, ideas, 1582, ars, memoriae, the, art, of, memory, 1582, and, cantus, circaeus, circe, s, song, 1582, described, at, circe, in, the, arts, reasoning, beasts, all, of, these, were, based, on, his, mnemonic, models, of, organized, knowledge, and, experience, as, opposed, to, the, simplistic, logic, based, mnemonic, techniques, of, petrus, ramus, then, becoming, popular, bruno, also, published, a, comedy, summarizing, some, of, his, philosophical, positions, titled, il, candelaio, the, candlemaker, 1582, in, the, 16th, century, dedications, were, as, a, rule, approved, beforehand, and, hence, were, a, way, of, placing, a, work, under, the, protection, of, an, individual, given, that, bruno, dedicated, various, works, to, the, likes, of, king, henry, iii, sir, philip, sidney, michel, de, castelnau, french, ambassador, to, england, and, possibly, pope, pius, v, it, is, apparent, that, this, wanderer, had, risen, sharply, in, status, and, moved, in, powerful, circles, in, april, 1583, bruno, went, to, england, with, letters, of, recommendation, from, henry, iii, as, a, guest, of, the, french, ambassador, michel, de, castelnau, bruno, lived, at, the, french, embassy, with, the, lexicographer, john, florio, there, he, became, acquainted, with, the, poet, philip, sidney, to, whom, he, dedicated, two, books, and, other, members, of, the, hermetic, circle, around, john, dee, though, there, is, no, evidence, that, bruno, ever, met, dee, himself, he, also, lectured, at, oxford, and, unsuccessfully, sought, a, teaching, position, there, his, views, were, controversial, notably, with, john, underhill, rector, of, lincoln, college, and, subsequently, bishop, of, oxford, and, george, abbot, who, later, became, archbishop, of, canterbury, abbot, mocked, bruno, for, supporting, the, opinion, of, copernicus, that, the, earth, did, go, round, and, the, heavens, did, stand, still, whereas, in, truth, it, was, his, own, head, which, rather, did, run, round, and, his, brains, did, not, stand, still, and, found, bruno, had, both, plagiarized, and, misrepresented, ficino, s, work, leading, bruno, to, return, to, the, continent, nevertheless, his, stay, in, england, was, fruitful, during, that, time, bruno, completed, and, published, some, of, his, most, important, works, the, six, italian, dialogues, including, the, cosmological, tracts, la, cena, de, le, ceneri, the, ash, wednesday, supper, 1584, de, la, causa, principio, et, uno, on, cause, principle, and, unity, 1584, de, l, infinito, universo, et, mondi, on, the, infinite, universe, and, worlds, 1584, as, well, as, lo, spaccio, de, la, bestia, trionfante, the, expulsion, of, the, triumphant, beast, 1584, and, de, gli, eroici, furori, on, the, heroic, frenzies, 1585, some, of, these, were, printed, by, john, charlewood, some, of, the, works, that, bruno, published, in, london, notably, the, ash, wednesday, supper, appear, to, have, given, offense, once, again, bruno, s, controversial, views, and, tactless, language, lost, him, the, support, of, his, friends, john, bossy, has, advanced, the, theory, that, while, staying, in, the, french, embassy, in, london, bruno, was, also, spying, on, catholic, conspirators, under, the, pseudonym, henry, fagot, for, sir, francis, walsingham, queen, elizabeth, s, secretary, of, state, bruno, is, sometimes, cited, as, being, the, first, to, propose, that, the, universe, is, infinite, which, he, did, during, his, time, in, england, but, an, english, scientist, thomas, digges, put, forth, this, idea, in, a, published, work, in, 1576, some, eight, years, earlier, than, bruno, an, infinite, universe, and, the, possibility, of, alien, life, had, also, been, earlier, suggested, by, german, catholic, cardinal, nicholas, of, cusa, in, on, learned, ignorance, published, in, 1440, and, bruno, attributed, his, understanding, of, multiple, worlds, to, this, earlier, scholar, who, he, called, the, divine, cusanus, in, october, 1585, castelnau, was, recalled, to, france, and, bruno, went, with, him, in, paris, bruno, found, a, tense, political, situation, moreover, his, 120, theses, against, aristotelian, natural, science, soon, put, him, in, ill, favor, in, 1586, following, a, violent, quarrel, over, these, theses, he, left, france, for, germany, in, germany, he, failed, to, obtain, a, teaching, position, at, marburg, but, was, granted, permission, to, teach, at, wittenberg, where, he, lectured, on, aristotle, for, two, years, however, with, a, change, of, intellectual, climate, there, he, was, no, longer, welcome, and, went, in, 1588, to, prague, where, he, obtained, 300, taler, from, rudolf, ii, but, no, teaching, position, he, went, on, to, serve, briefly, as, a, professor, in, helmstedt, but, had, to, flee, again, in, 1590, when, he, was, excommunicated, by, the, lutherans, during, this, period, he, produced, several, latin, works, dictated, to, his, friend, and, secretary, girolamo, besler, including, de, magia, on, magic, theses, de, magia, theses, on, magic, and, de, vinculis, in, genere, a, general, account, of, bonding, all, these, were, apparently, transcribed, or, recorded, by, besler, or, bisler, between, 1589, and, 1590, he, also, published, de, imaginum, signorum, et, idearum, compositione, on, the, composition, of, images, signs, and, ideas, 1591, in, 1591, he, was, in, frankfurt, where, he, received, an, invitation, from, the, venetian, patrician, giovanni, mocenigo, who, wished, to, be, instructed, in, the, art, of, memory, and, also, heard, of, a, vacant, chair, in, mathematics, at, the, university, of, padua, at, the, time, the, inquisition, seemed, to, be, losing, some, of, its, strictness, and, because, the, republic, of, venice, was, the, most, liberal, state, in, the, italian, peninsula, bruno, was, lulled, into, making, the, fatal, mistake, of, returning, to, italy, he, went, first, to, padua, where, he, taught, briefly, and, applied, unsuccessfully, for, the, chair, of, mathematics, which, was, given, instead, to, galileo, galilei, one, year, later, bruno, accepted, mocenigo, s, invitation, and, moved, to, venice, in, march, 1592, for, about, two, months, he, served, as, an, in, house, tutor, to, mocenigo, to, whom, he, let, slip, some, of, his, heterodox, ideas, mocenigo, denounced, him, to, the, venetian, inquisition, which, had, bruno, arrested, on, 22, may, 1592, among, the, numerous, charges, of, blasphemy, and, heresy, brought, against, him, in, venice, based, on, mocenigo, s, denunciation, was, his, belief, in, the, plurality, of, worlds, as, well, as, accusations, of, personal, misconduct, bruno, defended, himself, skillfully, stressing, the, philosophical, character, of, some, of, his, positions, denying, others, and, admitting, that, he, had, had, doubts, on, some, matters, of, dogma, the, roman, inquisition, however, asked, for, his, transfer, to, rome, after, several, months, of, argument, the, venetian, authorities, reluctantly, consented, and, bruno, was, sent, to, rome, in, january, 1593, during, the, seven, years, of, his, trial, in, rome, bruno, was, held, in, confinement, lastly, in, the, tower, of, nona, some, important, documents, about, the, trial, are, lost, but, others, have, been, preserved, among, them, a, summary, of, the, proceedings, that, was, rediscovered, in, 1940, the, numerous, charges, against, bruno, based, on, some, of, his, books, as, well, as, on, witness, accounts, included, blasphemy, immoral, conduct, and, heresy, in, matters, of, dogmatic, theology, and, involved, some, of, the, basic, doctrines, of, his, philosophy, and, cosmology, luigi, firpo, speculates, the, charges, made, against, bruno, by, the, roman, inquisition, were, bruno, defended, himself, as, he, had, in, venice, insisting, that, he, accepted, the, church, s, dogmatic, teachings, but, trying, to, preserve, the, basis, of, his, cosmological, views, in, particular, he, held, firm, to, his, belief, in, the, plurality, of, worlds, although, he, was, admonished, to, abandon, it, his, trial, was, overseen, by, the, inquisitor, cardinal, bellarmine, who, demanded, a, full, recantation, which, bruno, eventually, refused, on, 20, january, 1600, pope, clement, viii, declared, bruno, a, heretic, and, the, inquisition, issued, a, sentence, of, death, according, to, the, correspondence, of, gaspar, schopp, of, breslau, he, is, said, to, have, made, a, threatening, gesture, towards, his, judges, and, to, have, replied, maiori, forsan, cum, timore, sententiam, in, me, fertis, quam, ego, accipiam, perhaps, you, pronounce, this, sentence, against, me, with, greater, fear, than, i, receive, it, he, was, turned, over, to, the, secular, authorities, on, 17, february, 1600, in, the, campo, de, fiori, a, central, roman, market, square, naked, with, his, tongue, imprisoned, because, of, his, wicked, words, he, was, burned, alive, at, the, stake, his, ashes, were, thrown, into, the, tiber, river, all, of, bruno, s, works, were, placed, on, the, index, librorum, prohibitorum, in, 1603, the, inquisition, cardinals, who, judged, giordano, bruno, were, cardinal, bellarmino, bellarmine, cardinal, madruzzo, madruzzi, camillo, cardinal, borghese, later, pope, paul, v, domenico, cardinal, pinelli, pompeio, cardinal, arrigoni, cardinal, sfondrati, pedro, cardinal, de, deza, manuel, and, cardinal, santorio, archbishop, of, santa, severina, cardinal, bishop, of, palestrina, the, measures, taken, to, prevent, bruno, continuing, to, speak, have, resulted, in, his, becoming, a, symbol, for, free, thought, and, speech, in, present, day, rome, where, an, annual, memorial, service, takes, place, close, to, the, spot, where, he, was, executed, the, earliest, likeness, of, bruno, is, an, engraving, published, in, 1715, and, cited, by, salvestrini, as, the, only, known, portrait, of, bruno, salvestrini, suggests, that, it, is, a, re, engraving, made, from, a, now, lost, original, this, engraving, has, provided, the, source, for, later, images, the, records, of, bruno, s, imprisonment, by, the, venetian, inquisition, in, may, 1592, describe, him, as, a, man, of, average, height, with, a, hazel, coloured, beard, and, the, appearance, of, being, about, forty, years, of, age, alternately, a, passage, in, a, work, by, george, abbot, indicates, that, bruno, was, of, diminutive, stature, when, that, italian, didapper, who, intituled, himselfe, philotheus, iordanus, brunus, nolanus, magis, elaboratae, theologiae, doctor, c, with, a, name, longer, than, his, body, in, the, first, half, of, the, 15th, century, nicholas, of, cusa, challenged, the, then, widely, accepted, philosophies, of, aristotelianism, envisioning, instead, an, infinite, universe, whose, center, was, everywhere, and, circumference, nowhere, and, moreover, teeming, with, countless, stars, he, also, predicted, that, neither, were, the, rotational, orbits, circular, nor, were, their, movements, uniform, in, the, second, half, of, the, 16th, century, the, theories, of, copernicus, 1473, 1543, began, diffusing, through, europe, copernicus, conserved, the, idea, of, planets, fixed, to, solid, spheres, but, considered, the, apparent, motion, of, the, stars, to, be, an, illusion, caused, by, the, rotation, of, the, earth, on, its, axis, he, also, preserved, the, notion, of, an, immobile, center, but, it, was, the, sun, rather, than, the, earth, copernicus, also, argued, the, earth, was, a, planet, orbiting, the, sun, once, every, year, however, he, maintained, the, ptolemaic, hypothesis, that, the, orbits, of, the, planets, were, composed, of, perfect, circles, deferents, and, epicycles, and, that, the, stars, were, fixed, on, a, stationary, outer, sphere, despite, the, widespread, publication, of, copernicus, work, de, revolutionibus, orbium, coelestium, during, bruno, s, time, most, educated, catholics, subscribed, to, the, aristotelian, geocentric, view, that, the, earth, was, the, center, of, the, universe, and, that, all, heavenly, bodies, revolved, around, it, the, ultimate, limit, of, the, universe, was, the, primum, mobile, whose, diurnal, rotation, was, conferred, upon, it, by, a, transcendental, god, not, part, of, the, universe, although, as, the, kingdom, of, heaven, adjacent, to, it, a, motionless, prime, mover, and, first, cause, the, fixed, stars, were, part, of, this, celestial, sphere, all, at, the, same, fixed, distance, from, the, immobile, earth, at, the, center, of, the, sphere, ptolemy, had, numbered, these, at, 1, 022, grouped, into, 48, constellations, the, planets, were, each, fixed, to, a, transparent, sphere, few, astronomers, of, bruno, s, time, accepted, copernicus, s, heliocentric, model, among, those, who, did, were, the, germans, michael, maestlin, 1550, 1631, christoph, rothmann, johannes, kepler, 1571, 1630, the, englishman, thomas, digges, c, 1546, 1595, author, of, a, perfit, description, of, the, caelestial, orbes, and, the, italian, galileo, galilei, 1564, 1642, in, 1584, bruno, published, two, important, philosophical, dialogues, la, cena, de, le, ceneri, and, de, l, infinito, universo, et, mondi, in, which, he, argued, against, the, planetary, spheres, christoph, rothmann, did, the, same, in, 1586, as, did, tycho, brahe, in, 1587, and, affirmed, the, copernican, principle, in, particular, to, support, the, copernican, view, and, oppose, the, objection, according, to, which, the, motion, of, the, earth, would, be, perceived, by, means, of, the, motion, of, winds, clouds, etc, in, la, cena, de, le, ceneri, bruno, anticipates, some, of, the, arguments, of, galilei, on, the, relativity, principle, note, that, he, also, uses, the, example, now, known, as, galileo, s, ship, theophilus, air, through, which, the, clouds, and, winds, move, are, parts, of, the, earth, to, mean, under, the, name, of, earth, the, whole, machinery, and, the, entire, animated, part, which, consists, of, dissimilar, parts, so, that, the, rivers, the, rocks, the, seas, the, whole, vaporous, and, turbulent, air, which, is, enclosed, within, the, highest, mountains, should, belong, to, the, earth, as, its, members, just, as, the, air, in, the, lungs, and, in, other, cavities, of, animals, by, which, they, breathe, widen, their, arteries, and, other, similar, effects, necessary, for, life, are, performed, the, clouds, too, move, through, accidents, in, the, body, of, the, earth, and, are, in, its, bowels, as, are, the, waters, with, the, earth, move, all, things, that, are, on, the, earth, if, therefore, from, a, point, outside, the, earth, something, were, thrown, upon, the, earth, it, would, lose, because, of, the, latter, s, motion, its, straightness, as, would, be, seen, on, the, ship, moving, along, a, river, if, someone, on, point, c, of, the, riverbank, were, to, throw, a, stone, along, a, straight, line, and, would, see, the, stone, miss, its, target, by, the, amount, of, the, velocity, of, the, ship, s, motion, but, if, someone, were, placed, high, on, the, mast, of, that, ship, move, as, it, may, however, fast, he, would, not, miss, his, target, at, all, so, that, the, stone, or, some, other, heavy, thing, thrown, downward, would, not, come, along, a, straight, line, from, the, point, e, which, is, at, the, top, of, the, mast, or, cage, to, the, point, d, which, is, at, the, bottom, of, the, mast, or, at, some, point, in, the, bowels, and, body, of, the, ship, thus, if, from, the, point, d, to, the, point, e, someone, who, is, inside, the, ship, would, throw, a, stone, straight, up, it, would, return, to, the, bottom, along, the, same, line, however, far, the, ship, moved, provided, it, was, not, subject, to, any, pitch, and, roll, bruno, s, infinite, universe, was, filled, with, a, substance, a, pure, air, aether, or, spiritus, that, offered, no, resistance, to, the, heavenly, bodies, which, in, bruno, s, view, rather, than, being, fixed, moved, under, their, own, impetus, momentum, most, dramatically, he, completely, abandoned, the, idea, of, a, hierarchical, universe, the, universe, is, then, one, infinite, immobile, it, is, not, capable, of, comprehension, and, therefore, is, endless, and, limitless, and, to, that, extent, infinite, and, indeterminable, and, consequently, immobile, bruno, s, cosmology, distinguishes, between, suns, which, produce, their, own, light, and, heat, and, have, other, bodies, moving, around, them, and, earths, which, move, around, suns, and, receive, light, and, heat, from, them, bruno, suggested, that, some, if, not, all, of, the, objects, classically, known, as, fixed, stars, are, in, fact, suns, according, to, astrophysicist, steven, soter, he, was, the, first, person, to, grasp, that, stars, are, other, suns, with, their, own, planets, bruno, wrote, that, other, worlds, have, no, less, virtue, nor, a, nature, different, from, that, of, our, earth, and, like, earth, contain, animals, and, inhabitants, during, the, late, 16th, century, and, throughout, the, 17th, century, bruno, s, ideas, were, held, up, for, ridicule, debate, or, inspiration, margaret, cavendish, for, example, wrote, an, entire, series, of, poems, against, atoms, and, infinite, worlds, in, poems, and, fancies, in, 1664, bruno, s, true, if, partial, vindication, would, have, to, wait, for, the, implications, and, impact, of, newtonian, cosmology, bruno, s, overall, contribution, to, the, birth, of, modern, science, is, still, controversial, some, scholars, follow, frances, yates, in, stressing, the, importance, of, bruno, s, ideas, about, the, universe, being, infinite, and, lacking, geocentric, structure, as, a, crucial, crossing, point, between, the, old, and, the, new, others, see, in, bruno, s, idea, of, multiple, worlds, instantiating, the, infinite, possibilities, of, a, pristine, indivisible, one, a, forerunner, of, everett, s, many, worlds, interpretation, of, quantum, mechanics, while, many, academics, note, bruno, s, theological, position, as, pantheism, several, have, described, it, as, pandeism, and, some, also, as, panentheism, physicist, and, philosopher, max, bernhard, weinstein, in, his, welt, und, lebensanschauungen, hervorgegangen, aus, religion, philosophie, und, naturerkenntnis, world, and, life, views, emerging, from, religion, philosophy, and, nature, wrote, that, the, theological, model, of, pandeism, was, strongly, expressed, in, the, teachings, of, bruno, especially, with, respect, to, the, vision, of, a, deity, for, which, the, concept, of, god, is, not, separated, from, that, of, the, universe, however, otto, kern, takes, exception, to, what, he, considers, weinstein, s, overbroad, assertions, that, bruno, as, well, as, other, historical, philosophers, such, as, john, scotus, eriugena, nicholas, of, cusa, mendelssohn, and, lessing, were, pandeists, or, leaned, towards, pandeism, discover, editor, corey, s, powell, also, described, bruno, s, cosmology, as, pandeistic, writing, that, it, was, a, tool, for, advancing, an, animist, or, pandeist, theology, and, this, assessment, of, bruno, as, a, pandeist, was, agreed, with, by, science, writer, michael, newton, keas, and, the, daily, beast, writer, david, sessions, the, vatican, has, published, few, official, statements, about, bruno, s, trial, and, execution, in, 1942, cardinal, giovanni, mercati, who, discovered, a, number, of, lost, documents, relating, to, bruno, s, trial, stated, that, the, church, was, perfectly, justified, in, condemning, him, on, the, 400th, anniversary, of, bruno, s, death, in, 2000, cardinal, angelo, sodano, declared, bruno, s, death, to, be, a, sad, episode, but, despite, his, regret, he, defended, bruno, s, prosecutors, maintaining, that, the, inquisitors, had, the, desire, to, serve, freedom, and, promote, the, common, good, and, did, everything, possible, to, save, his, life, in, the, same, year, pope, john, paul, ii, made, a, general, apology, for, the, use, of, violence, that, some, have, committed, in, the, service, of, truth, some, authors, have, characterized, bruno, as, a, martyr, of, science, suggesting, parallels, with, the, galileo, affair, which, began, around, 1610, it, should, not, be, supposed, writes, a, m, paterson, of, bruno, and, his, heliocentric, solar, system, that, he, reached, his, conclusions, via, some, mystical, revelation, his, work, is, an, essential, part, of, the, scientific, and, philosophical, developments, that, he, initiated, paterson, echoes, hegel, in, writing, that, bruno, ushers, in, a, modern, theory, of, knowledge, that, understands, all, natural, things, in, the, universe, to, be, known, by, the, human, mind, through, the, mind, s, dialectical, structure, ingegno, writes, that, bruno, embraced, the, philosophy, of, lucretius, aimed, at, liberating, man, from, the, fear, of, death, and, the, gods, characters, in, bruno, s, cause, principle, and, unity, desire, to, improve, speculative, science, and, knowledge, of, natural, things, and, to, achieve, a, philosophy, which, brings, about, the, perfection, of, the, human, intellect, most, easily, and, eminently, and, most, closely, corresponds, to, the, truth, of, nature, other, scholars, oppose, such, views, and, claim, bruno, s, martyrdom, to, science, to, be, exaggerated, or, outright, false, for, yates, while, nineteenth, century, liberals, were, thrown, into, ecstasies, over, bruno, s, copernicanism, bruno, pushes, copernicus, scientific, work, back, into, a, prescientific, stage, back, into, hermeticism, interpreting, the, copernican, diagram, as, a, hieroglyph, of, divine, mysteries, according, to, historian, mordechai, feingold, both, admirers, and, critics, of, giordano, bruno, basically, agree, that, he, was, pompous, and, arrogant, highly, valuing, his, opinions, and, showing, little, patience, with, anyone, who, even, mildly, disagreed, with, him, discussing, bruno, s, experience, of, rejection, when, he, visited, oxford, university, feingold, suggests, that, it, might, have, been, bruno, s, manner, his, language, and, his, self, assertiveness, rather, than, his, ideas, that, caused, offence, in, his, lectures, on, the, history, of, philosophy, hegel, writes, that, bruno, s, life, represented, a, bold, rejection, of, all, catholic, beliefs, resting, on, mere, authority, alfonso, ingegno, states, that, bruno, s, philosophy, challenges, the, developments, of, the, reformation, calls, into, question, the, truth, value, of, the, whole, of, christianity, and, claims, that, christ, perpetrated, a, deceit, on, mankind, bruno, suggests, that, we, can, now, recognize, the, universal, law, which, controls, the, perpetual, becoming, of, all, things, in, an, infinite, universe, a, m, paterson, says, that, while, we, no, longer, have, a, copy, of, the, official, papal, condemnation, of, bruno, his, heresies, included, the, doctrine, of, the, infinite, universe, and, the, innumerable, worlds, and, his, beliefs, on, the, movement, of, the, earth, michael, white, notes, that, the, inquisition, may, have, pursued, bruno, early, in, his, life, on, the, basis, of, his, opposition, to, aristotle, interest, in, arianism, reading, of, erasmus, and, possession, of, banned, texts, white, considers, that, bruno, s, later, heresy, was, multifaceted, and, may, have, rested, on, his, conception, of, infinite, worlds, this, was, perhaps, the, most, dangerous, notion, of, all, if, other, worlds, existed, with, intelligent, beings, living, there, did, they, too, have, their, visitations, the, idea, was, quite, unthinkable, frances, yates, rejects, what, she, describes, as, the, legend, that, bruno, was, prosecuted, as, a, philosophical, thinker, was, burned, for, his, daring, views, on, innumerable, worlds, or, on, the, movement, of, the, earth, yates, however, writes, that, the, church, was, perfectly, within, its, rights, if, it, included, philosophical, points, in, its, condemnation, of, bruno, s, heresies, because, the, philosophical, points, were, quite, inseparable, from, the, heresies, according, to, the, stanford, encyclopedia, of, philosophy, in, 1600, there, was, no, official, catholic, position, on, the, copernican, system, and, it, was, certainly, not, a, heresy, when, bruno, was, burned, at, the, stake, as, a, heretic, it, had, nothing, to, do, with, his, writings, in, support, of, copernican, cosmology, the, website, of, the, vatican, apostolic, archive, discussing, a, summary, of, legal, proceedings, against, bruno, in, rome, states, in, the, same, rooms, where, giordano, bruno, was, questioned, for, the, same, important, reasons, of, the, relationship, between, science, and, faith, at, the, dawning, of, the, new, astronomy, and, at, the, decline, of, aristotle, s, philosophy, sixteen, years, later, cardinal, bellarmino, who, then, contested, bruno, s, heretical, theses, summoned, galileo, galilei, who, also, faced, a, famous, inquisitorial, trial, which, luckily, for, him, ended, with, a, simple, abjuration, following, the, 1870, capture, of, rome, by, the, newly, created, kingdom, of, italy, and, the, end, of, the, church, s, temporal, power, over, the, city, the, erection, of, a, monument, to, bruno, on, the, site, of, his, execution, became, feasible, the, monument, was, sharply, opposed, by, the, clerical, party, but, was, finally, erected, by, the, rome, municipality, and, inaugurated, in, 1889, a, statue, of, a, stretched, human, figure, standing, on, its, head, designed, by, alexander, polzin, and, depicting, bruno, s, death, at, the, stake, was, placed, in, potsdamer, platz, station, in, berlin, on, 2, march, 2008, retrospective, iconography, of, bruno, shows, him, with, a, dominican, cowl, but, not, tonsured, edward, gosselin, has, suggested, that, it, is, likely, bruno, kept, his, tonsure, at, least, until, 1579, and, it, is, possible, that, he, wore, it, again, thereafter, an, idealized, animated, version, of, bruno, appears, in, the, first, episode, of, the, 2014, television, series, cosmos, a, spacetime, odyssey, in, this, depiction, bruno, is, shown, with, a, more, modern, look, without, tonsure, and, wearing, clerical, robes, and, without, his, hood, cosmos, presents, bruno, as, an, impoverished, philosopher, who, was, ultimately, executed, due, to, his, refusal, to, recant, his, belief, in, other, worlds, a, portrayal, that, was, criticized, by, some, as, simplistic, or, historically, inaccurate, corey, s, powell, of, discover, magazine, says, of, bruno, a, major, reason, he, moved, around, so, much, is, that, he, was, argumentative, sarcastic, and, drawn, to, controversy, he, was, a, brilliant, complicated, difficult, man, poems, that, refer, to, bruno, include, bruno, and, his, theory, of, the, coincidence, of,
