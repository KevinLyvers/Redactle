theodora, i, d, r, greek, c, 490, 28, june, 548, was, a, byzantine, empress, and, wife, of, emperor, justinian, i, she, was, from, humble, origins, and, became, empress, when, her, husband, became, emperor, in, 527, she, was, one, of, his, chief, advisers, theodora, is, a, saint, in, the, eastern, orthodox, church, and, the, oriental, orthodox, church, commemorated, on, 28, june, theodora, was, of, greek, descent, but, much, of, her, early, life, including, her, place, of, birth, is, unknown, procopius, s, secret, history, is, the, foremost, source, of, her, life, before, marriage, but, is, often, regarded, as, slanderous, according, to, michael, the, syrian, her, birthplace, was, in, mabbug, syria, nicephorus, callistus, xanthopoulos, says, theodora, is, a, native, of, cyprus, and, the, patria, attributed, to, george, codinus, claims, theodora, came, from, paphlagonia, she, was, born, c, ad, 490, her, father, acacius, was, a, bear, trainer, for, the, hippodrome, s, green, faction, in, constantinople, given, her, father, s, profession, modern, scholars, argue, that, it, is, highly, probable, that, theodora, was, a, native, of, the, capital, this, is, furthered, in, procopius, narrative, her, mother, whose, name, was, not, recorded, was, a, dancer, and, an, actress, she, had, two, sisters, an, elder, named, comito, and, a, younger, named, anastasia, after, her, father, s, death, her, mother, remarried, but, the, family, lacked, a, source, of, income, because, acacius, position, was, given, away, by, asterius, a, green, faction, official, who, accepted, a, bribe, in, exchange, when, theodora, was, four, her, mother, brought, her, children, wearing, garlands, into, the, hippodrome, presenting, them, as, suppliants, to, the, green, faction, but, they, rebuffed, her, efforts, consequently, theodora, s, mother, approached, the, blue, faction, which, took, pity, on, the, family, and, gave, the, position, of, bear, keeper, to, theodora, s, stepfather, according, to, procopius, secret, history, before, the, onset, of, adolescence, theodora, began, her, work, as, a, prostitute, by, joining, alongside, her, older, sister, comito, when, she, performed, onstage, and, worked, in, a, constantinople, brothel, serving, low, and, high, status, customers, later, she, performed, on, stage, in, his, account, of, theodora, edward, gibbon, wrote, her, venal, charms, were, abandoned, to, a, promiscuous, crowd, of, citizens, and, strangers, of, every, rank, and, of, every, position, the, fortunate, lover, who, had, been, promised, a, night, of, enjoyment, was, often, driven, from, her, bed, by, a, stronger, or, more, wealthy, favorite, and, when, she, passed, through, the, streets, her, presence, was, avoided, by, all, who, wished, to, escape, either, the, scandal, or, the, temptation, procopius, wrote, that, theodora, made, a, name, for, herself, with, her, pornographic, portrayal, of, leda, and, the, swan, where, she, would, have, birds, eat, seeds, from, her, nude, body, employment, as, an, actress, at, the, time, would, have, included, performing, indecent, exhibitions, on, stage, and, providing, sexual, services, off, stage, during, this, time, she, may, have, met, antonina, the, future, wife, of, belisarius, who, also, became, a, part, of, the, women, s, court, led, by, theodora, one, time, when, she, went, to, the, house, of, a, notable, to, entertain, during, drinks, they, say, that, when, the, eyes, of, all, the, diners, were, upon, her, she, mounted, the, frame, of, the, couch, by, their, feet, and, unceremoniously, lifted, up, her, clothes, right, there, and, then, not, caring, in, the, least, that, she, was, making, a, spectacle, of, her, shamelessness, even, though, she, put, three, of, her, orifices, to, work, she, would, impatiently, reproach, nature, for, not, making, the, holes, in, her, nipples, bigger, than, they, were, so, that, she, could, devise, additional, sexual, positions, involving, them, as, well, she, was, often, pregnant, but, by, using, almost, all, known, techniques, she, could, induce, immediate, abortions, the, accuracy, of, procopius, s, portrayal, of, theodora, s, early, career, is, unclear, sexual, promiscuity, was, ascribed, to, many, female, actresses, and, performers, of, the, time, and, the, secret, history, s, lengthy, and, pornographic, descriptions, of, theodora, s, behavior, are, perceived, as, slanderous, slut, shaming, and, unreliable, by, many, modern, historians, procopius, relied, on, gossip, propaganda, and, prejudice, to, describe, events, of, which, he, had, no, first, hand, knowledge, however, some, contemporary, authors, such, as, john, of, ephesus, also, describe, theodora, as, having, come, from, the, brothel, but, this, translation, of, pornae, which, most, commonly, means, prostitutes, is, used, by, john, ephesus, to, refer, to, actresses, suggesting, that, porneion, which, commonly, means, brothel, in, classical, greek, was, used, to, describe, her, past, as, an, actress, and, not, the, place, she, came, from, therefore, the, association, of, theodora, with, a, brothel, may, only, reflect, her, time, on, stage, as, an, actress, instead, of, her, being, a, prostitute, consistent, with, the, christian, principles, of, repentance, and, forgiveness, john, wrote, of, her, redemption, as, a, positive, tale, later, theodora, traveled, to, north, africa, as, the, concubine, of, a, syrian, official, named, hecebolus, who, became, the, governor, of, the, libyan, pentapolis, procopius, alleges, that, hecebolus, mistreated, theodora, with, their, relationship, dissolving, after, a, quarrel, in, africa, theodora, destitute, of, the, means, of, life, settled, in, alexandria, egypt, where, some, historians, speculate, that, she, met, patriarch, timothy, iii, a, miaphysite, and, converted, to, miaphysite, christianity, from, alexandria, she, traveled, to, antioch, where, she, met, a, blue, faction, dancer, called, macedonia, who, may, have, served, as, an, informer, for, justinian, according, to, procopius, macedonia, and, justinian, often, exchanged, letters, afterwards, theodora, returned, to, constantinople, where, she, met, justinian, justinian, wanted, to, marry, theodora, but, roman, law, from, constantine, s, time, barred, anyone, of, senatorial, rank, from, marrying, an, actress, equally, giving, up, this, profession, did, not, impact, the, legality, of, the, marriage, as, anyone, who, had, been, an, actress, would, furthermore, be, regarded, as, such, the, empress, euphemia, consort, of, the, emperor, justin, also, strongly, opposed, the, marriage, following, euphemia, s, death, in, 524, justin, passed, a, new, law, allowing, reformed, actresses, to, marry, outside, of, their, rank, if, the, marriage, was, approved, by, the, emperor, shortly, thereafter, justinian, married, theodora, according, to, procopius, these, laws, were, created, specifically, for, justinian, and, theodora, theodora, had, an, illegitimate, daughter, whose, name, and, father, are, unknown, it, also, appears, that, she, was, married, and, had, children, with, another, monophysite, the, same, law, that, allowed, justinian, and, theodora, to, marry, let, theodora, s, daughter, marry, a, relative, of, the, late, emperor, anastasius, procopius, s, secret, history, claimed, that, theodora, also, had, an, illegitimate, son, john, who, arrived, in, constantinople, several, years, after, justinian, and, theodora, s, marriage, according, to, procopius, when, theodora, learned, of, john, s, arrival, and, claims, of, kinship, to, her, she, secretly, had, him, sent, away, and, he, was, never, heard, from, again, some, historians, including, classics, scholar, james, allan, evans, believe, that, procopius, s, account, of, john, is, unlikely, to, be, factual, because, theodora, publicly, acknowledged, her, illegitimate, daughter, and, therefore, would, have, acknowledged, an, illegitimate, son, had, one, existed, when, justinian, succeeded, to, the, throne, in, 527, theodora, was, crowned, augusta, and, became, empress, of, the, eastern, roman, empire, according, to, procopius, she, helped, her, husband, make, decisions, plans, and, political, strategies, participated, in, state, councils, and, had, great, influence, over, him, justinian, called, her, his, partner, in, my, deliberations, in, novel, 8, 1, ad, 535, anti, corruption, legislation, where, provincial, officials, had, to, take, an, oath, to, the, emperor, and, theodora, sources, generally, agree, on, her, character, being, vindictive, but, loyal, and, determined, she, secured, her, influence, though, instilling, fear, in, her, subjects, with, little, care, for, the, consequences, as, justinian, s, partner, theodora, shared, his, vision, of, the, byzantine, empire, his, vision, was, straightforward, there, could, be, no, roman, empire, that, did, not, include, rome, within, its, control, since, childhood, he, was, taught, that, there, was, one, god, and, one, legitimate, empire, as, the, only, christian, emperor, and, empress, they, believed, it, was, their, role, to, duplicate, the, heavenly, structure, on, earth, being, relatively, young, as, an, emperor, and, empress, compared, to, their, recent, predecessors, neither, justinian, nor, theodora, was, content, to, maintain, the, status, quo, their, goals, and, projects, whether, building, new, churches, and, public, buildings, or, raising, troops, for, expansive, military, campaigns, required, a, large, amount, of, funding, justinian, and, his, chief, financial, minister, john, the, cappadocian, ruthlessly, pursued, additional, taxes, from, the, aristocracy, who, bristled, at, the, lack, of, respect, for, their, patrician, status, two, major, party, factions, were, at, odds, before, during, and, after, justinian, and, theodora, s, reign, the, blues, and, the, greens, street, violence, between, the, parties, was, a, regular, event, when, justinian, became, emperor, he, was, determined, to, make, the, city, a, more, lawful, and, orderly, community, however, his, efforts, were, not, perceived, as, being, even, handed, since, both, his, and, theodora, s, favor, were, believed, to, align, with, the, blues, justinian, was, thought, to, prefer, the, blues, due, to, their, more, moderate, stances, while, theodora, s, family, was, abandoned, by, the, greens, after, her, father, s, death, and, consequently, given, support, by, the, blues, as, a, child, consequently, the, greens, felt, isolated, and, frustrated, during, a, riot, between, the, two, factions, in, early, january, 532, the, urban, prefect, eudaemon, arrested, a, group, of, both, green, and, blue, felons, and, convicted, them, of, murder, they, were, sentenced, to, death, but, two, of, the, felons, one, blue, and, one, green, survived, the, hanging, when, the, scaffold, collapsed, at, the, hippodrome, where, the, public, was, permitted, to, entreat, the, emperor, on, issues, the, two, factions, united, in, a, chant, asking, for, mercy, for, both, parties, justinian, recognized, the, danger, of, these, factions, uniting, against, theodora, and, himself, and, retreated, to, the, palace, the, rioters, set, many, public, buildings, on, fire, and, proclaimed, a, new, emperor, hypatius, the, nephew, of, the, former, emperor, anastasius, i, unable, to, control, the, mob, justinian, and, his, officials, prepared, to, flee, according, to, procopius, theodora, was, the, one, who, persuaded, justinian, and, his, court, from, fleeing, and, take, the, offensive, instead, procopius, wrote, that, theodora, spoke, against, leaving, the, palace, at, a, meeting, of, the, government, council, underlining, the, significance, of, someone, who, dies, as, a, ruler, instead, of, living, as, an, exile, or, in, hiding, according, to, procopius, theodora, interrupted, the, emperor, and, his, counselors, saying, my, lords, the, present, occasion, is, too, serious, to, allow, me, to, follow, the, convention, that, a, woman, should, not, speak, in, a, man, s, council, those, whose, interests, are, threatened, by, extreme, danger, should, think, only, of, the, wisest, course, of, action, not, of, conventions, in, my, opinion, flight, is, not, the, right, course, even, if, it, should, bring, us, to, safety, it, is, impossible, for, a, person, having, been, born, into, this, world, not, to, die, but, for, one, who, has, reigned, it, is, intolerable, to, be, a, fugitive, may, i, never, be, deprived, of, this, purple, robe, and, may, i, never, see, the, day, when, those, who, meet, me, do, not, call, me, empress, if, you, wish, to, save, yourself, my, lord, there, is, no, difficulty, we, are, rich, over, there, is, the, sea, and, yonder, are, the, ships, yet, reflect, for, a, moment, whether, when, you, have, once, escaped, to, a, place, of, security, you, would, not, gladly, exchange, such, safety, for, death, as, for, me, i, agree, with, the, adage, that, royal, purple, is, the, noblest, shroud, her, speech, motivated, the, men, including, justinian, he, ordered, his, loyal, troops, to, attack, the, demonstrators, in, the, hippodrome, resulting, in, the, deaths, of, over, 30, 000, civilian, rebels, other, reports, claim, greater, numbers, of, victims, with, the, numbers, increasing, with, the, distance, from, constantinople, the, scholar, and, historian, zachariah, of, mytilene, estimated, the, dead, at, more, than, 80, 000, despite, his, claims, that, he, was, unwillingly, named, emperor, by, the, mob, hypatius, was, put, to, death, by, justinian, in, one, source, this, came, at, theodora, s, insistence, some, scholars, interpret, procopius, account, intended, to, portray, justinian, as, more, cowardly, than, his, wife, noting, that, procopius, probably, fabricated, her, speech, changing, the, term, tyranny, to, royal, purple, possibly, reflects, procopius, desire, to, link, theodora, and, justinian, to, ancient, tyrants, following, the, nika, revolt, justinian, and, theodora, rebuilt, constantinople, including, aqueducts, bridges, and, more, than, 25, churches, the, most, famous, of, which, is, hagia, sophia, recognizing, the, danger, of, allowing, dissent, to, grow, justinian, and, theodora, monitored, their, administration, s, actions, to, ensure, positive, impacts, for, the, common, people, however, they, soon, felt, secure, enough, to, reinstate, the, two, ministers, that, were, dismissed, to, appease, the, rebels, john, the, cappadocian, as, financial, minister, and, tribonian, as, the, primary, legal, minister, justinian, and, theodora, retained, a, distaste, for, the, aristocrats, that, had, attempted, to, unseat, them, in, retaliation, for, their, disloyalty, the, nineteen, senators, who, participated, in, the, attempted, nika, coup, had, their, estates, destroyed, and, their, bodies, were, dumped, in, the, sea, those, who, remained, experienced, higher, taxes, and, other, wealth, capture, schemes, created, by, john, the, cappadocian, to, fund, justinian, and, theodora, s, rebuilding, plans, theodora, was, said, to, have, been, interested, in, the, court, ceremony, according, to, procopius, all, senators, including, patricians, were, required, to, prostrate, themselves, whenever, entering, the, imperial, couple, s, presence, not, even, government, officials, could, approach, the, empress, without, expending, much, time, and, effort, they, were, treated, like, servants, and, kept, waiting, in, a, small, stuffy, room, for, an, endless, time, after, many, days, some, of, them, might, at, last, be, summoned, but, going, into, her, presence, in, great, fear, they, very, quickly, departed, they, simply, showed, their, respect, by, lying, face, down, and, touching, the, instep, of, each, of, her, feet, with, their, lips, there, was, no, opportunity, to, speak, or, to, make, any, request, unless, she, told, them, to, do, so, the, government, officials, had, sunk, into, a, slavish, condition, and, she, was, their, slave, instructor, the, couple, also, made, it, clear, that, their, relationship, with, the, civil, militia, was, that, of, master, to, slave, they, also, supervised, the, magistrates, to, reduce, bureaucratic, corruption, the, praetorian, prefect, peter, barsymes, was, theodora, s, close, ally, she, considered, john, the, cappadocian, justinian, s, chief, tax, collector, as, her, enemy, because, of, his, independence, and, great, influence, theodora, and, antonina, devised, a, plot, to, bring, down, john, she, engaged, in, matchmaking, forming, a, network, of, alliances, between, new, and, old, powers, including, emperor, anastasius, family, pre, existing, nobility, and, the, new, monarchy, of, justinian, s, family, according, to, secret, history, she, attempted, to, marry, her, grandson, anastasius, to, joannina, belisarius, and, antonina, s, daughter, and, heiress, against, her, parents, will, although, the, marriage, was, initially, rejected, the, couple, eventually, married, the, marriages, of, her, sister, comito, to, general, sittas, and, her, niece, sophia, to, justinian, s, nephew, justin, ii, who, would, succeed, to, the, throne, are, suspected, to, have, been, engineered, by, theodora, she, also, gave, reception, and, sent, letters, and, gifts, to, persian, and, foreign, ambassadors, and, the, sister, of, kavad, theodora, was, involved, in, helping, underprivileged, women, in, a, well, known, instance, she, compelled, general, artabanes, who, intended, to, wed, justinian, s, niece, to, reclaim, the, wife, he, abandoned, she, sometimes, would, buying, girls, who, had, been, sold, into, prostitution, freeing, them, and, providing, for, their, future, she, created, a, convent, on, the, asian, side, of, the, dardanelles, called, the, metanoia, repentance, where, the, ex, prostitutes, could, support, themselves, procopius, secret, history, maintained, that, instead, of, preventing, forced, prostitution, as, in, buildings, 1, 9, 3ff, theodora, is, said, to, have, rounded, up, 500, prostitutes, confining, them, to, a, convent, they, sought, to, escape, the, unwelcome, transformation, by, leaping, over, the, walls, sh, 17, this, can, be, seen, as, an, attempt, to, escape, or, take, their, own, lives, whilst, the, existence, of, this, house, was, indeed, factual, there, is, no, evidence, supporting, that, the, actions, of, these, women, did, run, or, harm, themselves, they, came, from, none, other, than, procopious, which, is, something, to, be, mindful, of, this, can, be, interpreted, as, a, way, for, procopious, to, diminish, the, good, deeds, of, theodora, on, the, other, hand, chronicler, john, malalas, wrote, positively, about, the, convent, declaring, that, theodora, freed, the, girls, from, the, yoke, of, their, wretched, slavery, as, well, as, helping, ex, prostitutes, theodora, tried, to, eradicate, prostitution, all, together, in, 528, theodora, and, justinian, ordered, the, closure, of, the, brothels, and, the, arrest, of, their, keepers, and, procurers, she, paid, their, owners, back, the, purchase, fee, freeing, the, prostitutes, from, their, captivity, to, facilitate, the, start, of, their, new, lives, she, supplied, the, liberated, women, with, clothing, and, gifted, each, of, them, a, gold, nomisma, the, biased, perspectives, of, procopius, towards, theodora, display, his, failure, to, understand, the, policy, changes, theodora, and, justinian, advocated, possibly, reflected, remorse, she, had, regarding, her, past, choices, and, aimed, to, shield, young, women, from, repeating, her, own, errors, justinian, and, theodora, s, legislations, also, expanded, the, rights, of, women, in, divorce, and, property, ownership, instituted, the, death, penalty, for, rape, forbade, exposure, of, unwanted, infants, gave, mothers, some, guardianship, rights, over, their, children, and, forbade, the, killing, of, a, wife, who, committed, adultery, in, wars, procopius, mentioned, that, theodora, was, naturally, inclined, to, assist, women, in, misfortune, and, according, to, secret, history, she, was, accused, of, unfairly, championing, the, wives, causes, more, so, when, they, were, charged, with, adultery, sh, 17, the, code, of, justinian, only, allowed, women, to, seek, a, divorce, from, their, husbands, due, to, either, abuse, or, a, wife, catching, their, husband, in, obvious, adultery, regardless, women, seeking, a, divorce, had, to, provide, clear, evidence, of, their, claims, procopius, describes, theodora, as, causing, women, to, become, morally, depraved, due, to, her, and, justinian, s, legal, actions, since, justinian, was, not, the, recognized, head, of, any, of, the, sects, of, the, christian, church, his, focus, was, on, reducing, or, eliminating, the, friction, between, the, various, christian, sects, and, the, empire, as, a, christian, emperor, he, believed, he, should, be, in, harmony, with, the, head, s, of, the, church, because, justinian, was, a, chalcedonian, and, theodora, was, a, miaphysite, non, chalcedonian, justinian, worked, to, heal, the, divide, between, the, constantinople, church, and, the, roman, church, he, wanted, a, united, church, that, would, partner, with, one, emperor, himself, the, emperor, would, manage, human, affairs, and, the, priesthood, would, manage, the, divine, affairs, of, god, since, the, emperor, was, accountable, to, the, law, justinian, ensured, that, the, law, recognized, the, emperor, as, the, law, incarnate, with, universal, authority, of, divine, origin, consequently, he, used, the, law, to, micromanage, the, implementation, of, religion, through, laws, aimed, at, its, very, execution, theodora, worked, against, her, husband, s, support, of, chalcedonian, christianity, in, the, ongoing, struggle, for, the, dominance, of, each, faction, as, a, result, she, was, accused, of, fostering, heresy, and, undermining, the, unity, of, christendom, however, procopius, and, evagrius, scholasticus, suggested, that, justinian, and, theodora, were, merely, pretending, to, oppose, each, other, theodora, founded, a, miaphysite, monastery, in, sykae, and, provided, shelter, in, the, palace, for, miaphysite, leaders, who, faced, opposition, from, the, majority, of, chalcedonian, christians, like, severus, and, anthimus, anthimus, had, been, appointed, patriarch, of, constantinople, under, her, influence, and, after, the, ex, communication, order, he, was, hidden, in, theodora, s, quarters, until, her, death, in, twelve, years, when, the, chalcedonian, patriarch, ephraim, provoked, a, violent, revolt, in, antioch, eight, miaphysite, bishops, were, invited, to, constantinople, theodora, welcomed, them, and, housed, them, in, the, hormisdas, palace, justinian, and, theodora, s, dwelling, before, they, became, emperor, and, empress, theodora, persistently, provided, sanctuary, for, persecuted, miaphysites, within, the, palace, accommodating, such, a, significant, number, of, monks, that, in, one, incident, several, hundred, gathered, in, a, grand, chamber, causing, the, floor, to, collapse, furthermore, the, empress, was, instrumental, in, building, the, church, of, sergius, and, bacchus, located, next, to, hormisdas, palace, the, dedicatory, inscription, which, remains, visible, to, this, day, proudly, proclaims, may, he, increase, the, power, of, the, god, crowned, theodora, whose, mind, is, adorned, with, piety, whose, constant, toil, lies, in, unsparing, efforts, to, nourish, the, destitute, when, pope, timothy, iii, of, alexandria, died, theodora, enlisted, the, help, of, the, augustal, prefect, and, the, duke, of, egypt, to, make, theodosius, a, disciple, of, severus, the, new, pope, thus, she, outmaneuvered, her, husband, who, wanted, a, chalcedonian, successor, however, pope, theodosius, i, of, alexandria, and, the, imperial, troops, could, not, hold, alexandria, against, justinian, s, chalcedonian, followers, justinian, exiled, the, pope, and, 300, miaphysites, to, the, fortress, of, delcus, in, thrace, when, pope, silverius, refused, theodora, s, demand, that, he, remove, the, anathema, of, pope, agapetus, i, from, patriarch, anthimus, she, sent, belisarius, instructions, to, find, a, pretext, to, remove, silverius, when, this, was, accomplished, pope, vigilius, was, appointed, in, his, stead, in, nobatae, south, of, egypt, the, inhabitants, were, converted, to, miaphysite, christianity, about, 540, justinian, was, determined, that, they, should, be, converted, to, the, chalcedonian, faith, with, theodora, equally, determined, that, they, should, become, miaphysites, justinian, made, arrangements, for, chalcedonian, missionaries, from, thebaid, to, go, with, presents, to, silko, the, king, of, the, nobatae, in, response, theodora, prepared, her, missionaries, and, wrote, to, the, duke, of, thebaid, asking, that, he, should, delay, her, husband, s, embassy, so, that, the, miaphysite, missionaries, would, arrive, first, the, duke, was, canny, enough, to, thwart, the, easygoing, justinian, instead, of, the, unforgiving, theodora, he, made, sure, that, the, chalcedonian, missionaries, were, delayed, when, they, eventually, reached, silko, they, were, sent, away, the, nobatae, had, already, adopted, the, miaphysite, creed, of, theodosius, theodora, s, death, is, recorded, by, victor, of, tonnena, with, the, cause, uncertain, however, the, greek, terms, used, are, often, translated, as, cancer, victor, notes, the, death, date, was, 28, june, 548, and, her, age, as, 48, although, other, sources, report, that, she, died, at, 51, later, accounts, attribute, the, death, to, breast, cancer, but, this, was, not, identified, in, the, original, report, where, the, use, of, the, term, cancer, probably, referred, to, a, more, general, suppurating, ulcer, or, malignant, tumor, she, was, buried, in, the, church, of, the, holy, apostles, in, constantinople, during, a, procession, in, 559, justinian, visited, and, lit, candles, for, her, tomb, the, main, historical, sources, about, her, life, are, the, works, of, her, contemporary, procopius, procopius, was, a, member, of, the, staff, of, belisarius, a, field, marshal, for, justinian, who, is, perhaps, the, best, known, officer, of, justinian, s, officers, because, of, procopius, s, writings, procopius, wrote, three, portrayals, of, the, empress, the, wars, of, justinian, largely, completed, in, 545, paints, a, picture, of, a, courageous, woman, who, helped, save, justinian, s, attempt, at, the, throne, later, he, wrote, the, secret, history, the, work, has, sometimes, been, interpreted, as, representing, disillusionment, with, emperor, justinian, the, empress, and, his, patron, belisarius, justinian, is, depicted, as, cruel, corrupt, extravagant, and, incompetent, while, theodora, is, shrewish, and, openly, sexual, procopius, buildings, of, justinian, written, after, secret, history, is, a, panegyric, that, paints, justinian, and, theodora, as, a, pious, couple, it, presents, particularly, flattering, portrayals, of, them, her, piety, and, beauty, are, praised, it, is, important, to, note, that, theodora, was, dead, when, the, work, was, published, and, justinian, most, likely, commissioned, the, work, her, contemporary, john, of, ephesus, writes, about, theodora, in, lives, of, the, eastern, saints, and, mentions, an, illegitimate, daughter, theophanes, the, confessor, mentions, some, familial, relations, of, theodora, that, were, not, mentioned, by, procopius, victor, tonnennensis, notes, her, familial, relation, to, the, next, empress, sophia, bar, hebraeus, and, michael, the, syrian, both, say, theodora, was, from, the, city, of, daman, near, kallinikos, syria, these, later, miaphysite, sources, account, say, that, theodora, is, the, daughter, of, a, priest, trained, in, the, pious, practices, of, miaphysitism, since, birth, the, miaphysites, tend, to, regard, theodora, as, one, of, their, own, their, account, is, also, an, alternative, to, that, of, contemporary, john, of, ephesus, many, modern, scholars, prefer, procopius, account, modern, historians, point, out, that, procopius, is, not, necessarily, a, reliable, source, for, understanding, theodora, and, her, historical, impact, procopius, is, believed, to, be, aligned, with, many, of, the, senatorial, ranks, that, disagreed, with, the, changes, and, policies, that, justinian, and, theodora, imposed, upon, the, empire, in, the, secret, history, 12, 12, 14, procopius, asserts, that, many, in, the, senatorial, class, were, being, strangled, by, tax, collectors, due, to, justinian, s, and, theodora, s, policy, of, collecting, and, retaining, the, attractive, properties, and, furniture, of, the, wealthy, while, generously, giving, back, properties, that, had, high, taxes, to, their, original, owners, at, one, point, procopius, compares, justinian, s, rule, to, the, bubonic, plague, 6, 22, 23, arguing, that, the, plague, was, a, better, option, since, half, the, population, escaped, unscathed, in, the, secret, history, procopius, also, criticizes, justinian, s, and, theodora, s, rule, as, the, antithesis, of, the, rule, of, good, emperors, and, empresses, his, portrayal, of, their, emotional, balance, and, power, is, significantly, different, justinian, was, even, of, temperament, approachable, and, kindly, even, while, ordering, the, confiscation, of, people, s, property, or, their, destruction, conversely, theodora, was, described, as, irrational, and, driven, by, her, anger, often, by, minor, affronts, or, insults, for, example, procopius, describes, two, separate, incidents, where, she, uses, the, judicial, system, to, publicly, accuse, men, of, having, sexual, relations, with, other, men, this, was, considered, an, inappropriate, forum, for, persons, of, standing, and, in, procopius, s, narrative, was, unappreciated, by, the, people, of, constantinople, when, one, of, the, accusations, is, ruled, as, unsubstantiated, procopius, writes, that, the, entire, city, celebrated, one, modern, researcher, suggests, that, procopius, s, writings, in, the, secret, history, amount, to, an, apocryphal, tale, of, the, dangers, of, the, rule, of, women, procopius, s, perspective, as, a, conservative, intellectual, was, that, women, with, their, wily, vices, served, to, vanquish, men, s, otherwise, virtuous, leadership, instincts, procopius, details, two, examples, of, theodora, s, engagement, in, the, byzantine, empire, s, foreign, policy, that, support, his, perspective, first, theodora, is, quoted, in, a, letter, to, the, persian, ambassador, declaring, that, emperor, justinian, did, nothing, without, her, consent, the, persian, king, used, this, as, an, example, to, his, nobles, of, a, failed, state, since, no, real, state, could, exist, that, was, governed, by, a, woman, similarly, the, gothic, king, theodahad, wrote, a, letter, to, theodora, confirming, that, you, exhort, me, to, bring, first, to, your, attention, anything, i, decide, to, ask, from, the, triumphal, prince, your, husband, before, issuing, a, degree, justinian, is, quoted, as, saying, he, discussed, it, with, our, most, august, consort, whom, god, has, given, us, all, of, these, examples, offend, procopius, s, sense, of, propriety, it, was, not, that, women, could, not, lead, an, empire, procopius, believed, that, only, women, demonstrating, masculine, virtues, and, strengths, were, appropriate, as, leaders, the, strength, of, the, feminine, theodora, was, not, hers, rather, it, was, the, lack, of, strength, demonstrated, by, justinian, that, created, the, impression, of, strength, by, theodora, the, definition, of, feminine, behavior, in, the, sixth, century, as, used, by, procopius, is, not, how, modern, writers, would, use, it, feminine, behavior, in, the, sixth, century, would, be, described, as, intriguing, and, interfering, according, to, researcher, averil, cameron, procopius, found, theodora, s, efforts, to, assist, repentant, prostitutes, not, the, actions, of, a, benefactress, but, instead, attempts, to, interfere, with, the, status, quo, which, he, found, objectionable, this, is, also, why, he, includes, her, speech, during, the, nika, insurrection, where, she, interferes, with, the, actions, of, the, men, as, they, contemplate, escaping, the, rioters, procopius, s, intent, in, describing, that, scene, is, to, demonstrate, that, theodora, does, not, stay, in, her, appropriate, role, at, his, core, procopius, wanted, to, preserve, the, social, order, henning, b, rm, chair, of, ancient, history, at, the, university, of, rostock, in, germany, described, this, social, order, as, a, social, hierarchy, people, stood, over, animals, freemen, stood, over, slaves, men, stood, over, eunuchs, and, men, stood, over, women, whenever, procopius, denounces, the, alleged, breach, of, these, rules, he, is, following, the, rules, of, historiography, although, procopius, demonstrates, bias, his, aggrandized, tales, and, retelling, of, salacious, rumors, compared, alongside, other, historians, of, the, era, provide, a, glimpse, into, the, changing, values, and, norms, of, the, period, rather, than, a, straightforward, biographical, study, of, theodora, s, life, and, character, for, example, the, portrayal, of, justinian, and, theodora, as, demons, in, the, secret, history, reflects, a, common, belief, held, by, people, during, this, period, some, stories, reflect, what, educated, people, wanted, to, believe, about, the, imperial, household, with, a, good, empress, being, pious, and, chaste, and, a, bad, empress, being, sexually, promiscuous, and, greedy, events, that, were, unexplainable, by, rational, means, were, either, a, product, of, divine, providence, or, the, result, of, evil, demons, when, procopius, cannot, explain, the, actions, of, the, emperor, and, empress, according, to, his, beliefs, he, falls, back, on, the, principle, of, outside, influences, being, the, likely, explanation, averil, cameron, says, that, describing, procopius, as, a, historian, is, incorrect, in, her, view, procopius, is, more, aptly, described, as, a, reporter, he, focuses, on, events, and, their, details, far, more, than, analyzing, motives, and, causes, consequently, his, portrayals, lack, nuance, and, harshly, describe, events, from, a, palette, of, black, and, white, his, rigidity, and, inability, to, embrace, change, make, him, a, suspect, voice, when, pursuing, a, deeper, understanding, of, how, and, why, events, occurred, as, they, did, this, may, also, explain, why, procopius, writings, are, significantly, different, from, the, accounts, of, other, contemporary, authors, while, other, writers, describe, the, daily, theological, battles, between, the, different, christian, sects, and, the, efforts, of, the, government, to, align, and, subdue, them, procopius, remains, almost, silent, on, these, topics, he, maintains, an, intense, and, political, focus, on, his, writing, that, prevents, a, balanced, and, holistic, perspective, this, intensity, results, in, his, portrayal, of, justinian, and, theodora, as, near, caricatures, by, exaggerating, their, faults, and, ignoring, their, successes, the, reader, is, compelled, to, see, them, as, villains, or, heroes, the, miaphysites, believed, theodora, s, influence, on, justinian, was, so, strong, that, after, her, death, he, worked, to, bring, harmony, between, the, miaphysites, non, chalcedonian, and, the, chalcedonian, christians, and, kept, his, promise, to, protect, her, little, community, of, miaphysite, refugees, in, the, hormisdas, palace, theodora, provided, much, political, support, for, the, ministry, of, jacob, baradaeus, diehl, attributes, the, modern, existence, of, non, chalcedonian, faith, equally, to, baradaeus, and, to, theodora, olbia, in, cyrenaica, was, renamed, theodorias, after, theodora, it, was, common, for, ancient, cities, to, rename, themselves, to, honor, an, emperor, or, empress, now, called, qasr, libya, the, city, is, known, for, its, sixth, century, mosaics, the, settlement, of, cululis, modern, day, ain, jelloula, in, what, is, now, tunisia, africa, proconsularis, was, also, renamed, theodoriana, after, theodora, theodora, and, justinian, are, represented, in, mosaics, in, the, basilica, of, san, vitale, of, ravenna, italy, which, were, completed, a, year, before, her, death, after, 547, when, the, byzantines, retook, the, city, she, is, depicted, in, full, imperial, garb, endowed, with, jewels, befitting, her, role, as, empress, her, cloak, is, embroidered, with, imagery, of, the, three, kings, bearing, their, gifts, for, the, christ, child, symbolizing, a, connection, between, her, and, justinian, bringing, gifts, to, the, church, in, this, case, she, is, shown, bearing, a, communion, chalice, in, addition, to, the, religious, tone, of, these, mosaics, other, mosaics, depict, theodora, and, justinian, receiving, the, vanquished, kings, of, the, goths, and, vandals, as, prisoners, of, war, surrounded, by, the, cheering, roman, senate, the, emperor, and, empress, are, recognized, for, both, victory, and, in, generosity, in, these,
