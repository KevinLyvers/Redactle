contentious, relationship, with, her, controlling, mother, in, law, the, townhouse, that, sara, gave, to, them, was, connected, to, her, own, residence, by, sliding, doors, and, sara, ran, both, households, in, the, decade, after, the, marriage, early, on, roosevelt, had, a, breakdown, in, which, she, explained, to, franklin, that, i, did, not, like, to, live, in, a, house, which, was, not, in, any, way, mine, one, that, i, had, done, nothing, about, and, which, did, not, represent, the, way, i, wanted, to, live, but, little, changed, sara, also, sought, to, control, the, raising, of, her, grandchildren, and, roosevelt, reflected, later, that, franklin, s, children, were, more, my, mother, in, law, s, children, than, they, were, mine, roosevelt, s, eldest, son, james, remembered, sara, telling, her, grandchildren, your, mother, only, bore, you, i, am, more, your, mother, than, your, mother, is, roosevelt, and, franklin, had, six, children, roosevelt, disliked, having, sex, with, her, husband, she, once, told, her, daughter, anna, that, it, was, an, ordeal, to, be, borne, she, also, considered, herself, ill, suited, to, motherhood, later, writing, it, did, not, come, naturally, to, me, to, understand, little, children, or, to, enjoy, them, in, september, 1918, roosevelt, was, unpacking, one, of, franklin, s, suitcases, when, she, discovered, a, bundle, of, love, letters, to, him, from, her, social, secretary, lucy, mercer, he, had, been, contemplating, leaving, his, wife, for, mercer, however, following, pressure, from, his, political, advisor, louis, howe, and, from, his, mother, who, threatened, to, disinherit, franklin, if, he, followed, through, with, a, divorce, the, couple, remained, married, their, union, from, that, point, on, was, more, of, a, political, partnership, disillusioned, roosevelt, again, became, active, in, public, life, and, focused, increasingly, on, her, social, work, rather, than, her, role, as, a, wife, in, august, 1921, the, family, was, vacationing, at, campobello, island, new, brunswick, canada, when, franklin, was, diagnosed, with, a, paralytic, illness, at, the, time, believed, to, be, polio, during, the, illness, through, her, nursing, care, roosevelt, probably, saved, franklin, from, death, his, legs, remained, permanently, paralyzed, when, the, extent, of, his, disability, became, clear, roosevelt, fought, a, protracted, battle, with, her, mother, in, law, over, his, future, persuading, him, to, stay, in, politics, despite, sara, s, urgings, that, he, retire, and, become, a, country, gentleman, franklin, s, attending, physician, dr, william, keen, commended, roosevelt, s, devotion, to, the, stricken, franklin, during, the, time, of, his, travail, you, have, been, a, rare, wife, and, have, borne, your, heavy, burden, most, bravely, he, said, proclaiming, her, one, of, my, heroines, this, proved, a, turning, point, in, eleanor, and, sara, s, long, running, struggle, and, as, eleanor, s, public, role, grew, she, increasingly, broke, from, sara, s, control, tensions, between, sara, and, eleanor, over, her, new, political, friends, rose, to, the, point, that, the, family, constructed, a, cottage, at, val, kill, in, which, eleanor, and, her, guests, lived, when, franklin, and, the, children, were, away, from, hyde, park, roosevelt, herself, named, the, place, val, kill, loosely, translated, as, waterfall, stream, from, the, dutch, language, common, to, the, original, european, settlers, of, the, area, franklin, encouraged, his, wife, to, develop, this, property, as, a, place, where, she, could, implement, some, of, her, ideas, for, work, with, winter, jobs, for, rural, workers, and, women, each, year, when, roosevelt, held, a, picnic, at, val, kill, for, delinquent, boys,

with, her, after, the, election, she, wrote, to, her, niece, i, just, hate, to, have, eleanor, let, herself, look, as, she, does, though, never, handsome, she, always, had, to, me, a, charming, effect, but, alas, and, lackaday, since, politics, have, become, her, choicest, interest, all, her, charm, has, disappeared, roosevelt, dismissed, bamie, s, criticisms, by, referring, to, her, as, an, aged, woman, however, bamie, and, roosevelt, eventually, reconciled, theodore, s, elder, daughter, alice, also, broke, with, roosevelt, over, her, campaign, alice, and, her, cousin, reconciled, after,

of, her, mother, s, social, duties, at, the, white, house, the, relationship, was, further, strained, because, roosevelt, desperately, wanted, to, go, with, her, husband, to, yalta, in, february,

picture, good, night, and, good, morning, at, franklin, s, 1933, inauguration, roosevelt, wore, a, sapphire, ring, hickok, had, given, her, fbi, director, j, edgar, hoover, despised, roosevelt, s, liberalism, her, stance, regarding, civil, rights, and, criticisms, of, hoover, s, surveillance, tactics, by, both, her, and, her, husband, and, so, hoover, maintained, a, large, file, on, roosevelt, which, the, filmmakers, of, the, biopic, j, edgar, 2011, indicate, included, compromising, evidence, of, this, relationship, with, which, hoover, intended, to, blackmail, roosevelt, compromised, as,

debate, about, whether, or, not, roosevelt, had, a, sexual, relationship, with, hickok, it, was, known, in, the, white, house, press, corps, at, the, time, that, hickok, was, a, lesbian, scholars, including, lillian, faderman, and, hazel, rowley, have, asserted, that, there, was, a, physical, component, to, the, relationship, while, hickok, biographer, doris, faber, has, argued, that, the, insinuative, phrases, have, misled, historians, doris, kearns, goodwin, stated, in, her, 1994, pulitzer, prize, winning, account, of, the, roosevelts, that, whether, hick, and, eleanor, went, beyond, kisses, and, hugs, could, not, be, determined, with, certainty, roosevelt, was, close, friends, with, several, lesbian, couples, such, as, nancy, cook, and, marion, dickerman, and, esther, lape, and, elizabeth, fisher, read, suggesting, that, she, understood, lesbianism, marie, souvestre, roosevelt, s, childhood, teacher, and, a, great, influence, on, her, later, thinking, was, also, a, lesbian, faber, published, some, of, roosevelt, and, hickok, s, correspondence, in, 1980, but, concluded, that, the, lovestruck, phrasing, was, simply, an, unusually, belated, schoolgirl, crush, and, warned, historians, not, to, be, misled, researcher, leila, j, rupp, criticized, faber, s, argument, calling, her, book, a, case, study, in, homophobia, and, arguing, that, faber, unwittingly, presented, page, after, page, of, evidence, that, delineates, the, growth, and, development, of, a, love, affair, between, the, two, women, in, 1992, roosevelt, biographer, blanche, wiesen, cook, argued, that, the, relationship, was, in, fact, romantic, generating, national, attention, a, 2011, essay, by, russell, baker, reviewing, two, new, roosevelt, biographies, in, the, new, york, review, of, books, franklin, and, eleanor, an, extraordinary, marriage, by, hazel, rowley, and, eleanor, roosevelt, transformative, first, lady, by, maurine, h, beasley, stated, that, the, hickok, relationship, was, indeed, erotic, now, seems, beyond, dispute, considering, what, is, known, about, the, letters, they, exchanged, in, the, same, years, washington, gossip, linked, roosevelt, romantically, with, new, deal, administrator, harry, hopkins, with, whom, she, worked, closely, roosevelt, also, had, a, close, relationship, with, new, york, state, police, sergeant, earl, miller, who, was, assigned, by, the, president, to, be, her, bodyguard, roosevelt, was, 44, years, old, when, she, met, miller, 32, in, 1929, he, became, her, friend, as, well, as, her, official, escort, teaching, her, different, sports, such, as, diving, and, riding, and, coached, her, in, tennis, biographer, blanche, wiesen, cook, writes, that, miller, was, roosevelt, s, first, romantic, involvement, in, her, middle, years, hazel, rowley, concludes, there, is, no, doubt, that, eleanor, was, in, love, with, earl, for, a, time, but, they, are, most, unlikely, to, have, had, an, affair, roosevelt, s, friendship, with, miller, occurred, at, the, same, time, that, her, husband, had, a, rumored, relationship, with, his, secretary, marguerite, missy, lehand, smith, writes, remarkably, both, er, and, franklin, recognized, accepted, and, encouraged, the, arrangement, eleanor, and, franklin, were, strong, willed, people, who, cared, greatly, for, each, other, s, happiness, but, realized, their, own, inability, to, provide, for, it, roosevelt, and, miller, s, relationship, is, said, to, have, continued, until, her, death, in, 1962, they, are, thought, to, have, corresponded, daily, but, all, letters, have, been, lost, according, to, rumor, the, letters, were, anonymously, purchased, and, destroyed, or, locked, away, when, she, died, roosevelt, was, a, longtime, friend, of, carrie, chapman, catt, and, gave, her, the, chi, omega, award, at, the, white, house, in, 1941, until, middle, age, eleanor, roosevelt, exhibited, antisemitic, tendencies, in, a, 1918, letter, to, her,

york, city, a, limited, number, of, jews, were, admitted, most, students, were, upper, class, protestants, and, roosevelt, said, that, the, spirit, of, the, school, would, be, different, if, we, had, too, large, a, proportion, of, jewish, children, she, said, the, problem, was, that, the, country, is, still, full, of, immigrant, jews, very, unlike, ourselves, by, 1929, however, when, she, made, those, statements, her, social, circle, had, begun, to, include, a, number, of, jews, including, elinor, and, henry, morgenthau, jr, bernard, baruch, edith, and, herbert, h, lehman, and, rose, schneiderman, in, the, 1930s, once, she, had, become, first, lady, she, began, speaking, out, against, the, growing, antisemitism, in, europe, and, the, united, states, and, advocating, for, allowing, more, jewish, refugees, into, the, united, states, however, according, to, historian, michelle, mart, while, serving, as, first, lady, although, it, is, clear, from, all, accounts, that, roosevelt, cared, deeply, about, the, plight, of, european, jews, her, public, actions, remained, limited, and, she, refrained, from, pressing, for, radical, policies, to, rescue, the, jews, after, world, war, ii, she, became, a, staunch, champion, of, israel, which, she, admired, for, its, commitment, to, new, deal, values, in, the, 1920, presidential, election, franklin, was, nominated, as, the, running,

funds, in, support, of, the, union, s, goals, a, 48, hour, workweek, minimum, wage, and, the, abolition, of, child, labor, throughout, the, 1920s, roosevelt, became, increasingly, influential, as, a, leader, in, the, new, york, state, democratic, party, while, franklin, used, her, contacts, among, democratic, women, to, strengthen, his, standing, with, them, winning, their, committed, support, for, the, future, in, 1924, she, campaigned, for, democrat, alfred, e, smith, in, his, successful, re, election, bid, as, governor, of, new, york, state, against, the, republican, nominee, and, her, first, cousin, theodore, roosevelt, jr, franklin, had, spoken, out, on, theodore, s, wretched, record, as, assistant, secretary, of, the, navy, during, the, teapot, dome, scandal, and, in, return, theodore, said, of, him, he, s, a, maverick, he, does, not, wear, the, brand, of, our, family, which, infuriated, her, she, dogged, theodore, on, the, new, york, state, campaign, trail, in, a, car, fitted, with, a, papier, m, ch, bonnet, shaped, like, a, giant, teapot, that, was, made, to, emit, simulated, steam, to, remind, voters, of, theodore, s, supposed, but, later, disproved, connections, to, the, scandal, and, countered, his, speeches, with, those, of, her, own, calling, him, immature, she, would, later, decry, these, methods, admitting, that, they, were, below, her, dignity, but, saying, that, they, had, been, contrived, by, democratic, party, dirty, tricksters, theodore, was, defeated, by, 105, 000, votes, and, he, never, forgave, her, by, 1928, roosevelt, was, promoting, smith, s, candidacy, for, president, and, franklin, s, nomination, as, the, democratic, party, s, candidate, for, governor, of, new, york, succeeding, smith, although, smith, lost, the, presidential,

s, distress, at, these, precedents, was, severe, enough, that, hickok, subtitled, her, biography, of, roosevelt, reluctant, first, lady, with, support, from, howe, and, hickok, roosevelt, set, out, to, redefine, the, position, according, to, her, biographer, blanche, wiesen, cook, she, became, the, most, controversial, first, lady, in, united, states, history, in, the, process, despite,

women, s, issues, being, a, political, asset, being, a, strong, public, communicator, public, service, performed, after, leaving, office, and, creating, a, lasting, legacy, she, was, also, found, to, be, the, second, easiest, first, lady, for, historians, to, imagine, serving, as, president, herself, in, the, 2014, survey, roosevelt, and, her, husband, were, also, ranked, the, highest, among,

for, introducing, the, american, youth, bill, of, rights, to, the, u, s, congress, roosevelt, s, relationship, with, the, ayc, eventually, led, to, the, formation, of, the, national, youth, administration, a, new, deal, agency, in, the, united, states, founded, in, 1935, that, focused, on, providing, work, and, education, for, americans, between, the, ages, of, 16, and, 25, the, nya, was, headed, by, aubrey, willis, williams, a, prominent, liberal, from, alabama, who, was, close, to, roosevelt, and, harry, hopkins, speaking, of, the, nya, in, the, 1930s, roosevelt, expressed, her, concern, about, ageism, stating, that, i, live, in, real, terror, when, i, think, we, may, be, losing, this, generation, we, have, got, to, bring, these, young, people, into, the, active, life, of, the, community, and, make, them, feel, that, they, are, necessary, in, 1939, the, dies, committee, subpoenaed, leaders, of, the, ayc, who, in, addition, to, serving, the, ayc, also, were, members, of, the, young, communist, league, roosevelt, was, in, attendance, at, the, hearings, and, afterward, invited, the, subpoenaed, witnesses, to, board, at, the, white, house, during, their, stay, in, washington, d, c, joseph, p, lash, was, one, of, her, boarders, on, february, 10, 1940, members, of, the, ayc, as, guests, of, roosevelt, in, her, capacity, as, first, lady, attended, a, picnic, on, the, white, house, lawn, where, they, were, addressed, by, franklin, from, the, south, portico, the, president, admonished, them, to, condemn, not, merely, the, nazi, regime, but, all, dictatorships, the, president, was, reportedly, booed, by, the, group, afterwards, many, of, the, same, youth, picketed, the, white, house, as, representatives, of, the, american, peace, mobilization, among, them, was, joseph, cadden, one, of, roosevelt, s, overnight, boarders, later, in, 1940, despite, roosevelt, s, publication, of, her, reasons, why, i, still, believe, in, the, youth, congress, the, american, youth, congress, was, disbanded, the, nya, was, shut, down, in, 1943, roosevelt, s, chief, project, during, her, husband, s, first, two, terms, was, the, establishment, of, a, planned, community, in, arthurdale, west, virginia, on, august, 18, 1933, at, hickok, s, urging, roosevelt, visited, the, families, of, homeless, miners, in, morgantown, west, virginia, who, had, been, blacklisted, following, union, activities, deeply, affected, by, the, visit, roosevelt, proposed, a, resettlement, community, for, the, miners, at, arthurdale, where, they, could, make, a, living, by, subsistence, farming, handicrafts, and, a, local, manufacturing, plant, she, hoped, the, project, could, become, a, model, for, a, new, kind, of, community, in, the, u, s, in, which, workers, would, be, better, cared, for, her, husband, enthusiastically, supported, the, project, after, an, initial, disastrous, experiment, with, prefab, houses, construction, began, again, in, 1934, to, roosevelt, s, specifications, this, time, with, every, modern, convenience, including, indoor, plumbing, and, central, steam, heat, families, occupied, the, first, fifty, homes, in, june, and, agreed, to, repay, the, government, in, thirty, years, time, though, roosevelt, had, hoped, for, a, racially, mixed, community, the, miners, insisted, on, limiting, membership, to, white, christians, after, losing, a, community, vote, roosevelt, recommended, the, creation, of, other, communities, for, the, excluded, black, and, jewish, miners, the, experience, motivated, roosevelt, to, become, much, more, outspoken, on, the, issue, of, racial, discrimination, roosevelt, remained, a, vigorous, fundraiser, for, the, community, for, several, years, as, well, as, spending, most, of, her, own, income, on, the, project, however, the, project, was, criticized, by, both, the, political, left, and, right, conservatives, condemned, it, as, socialist, and, a, communist, plot, while, democratic, members, of, congress, opposed, government, competition, with, private, enterprise, secretary, of, the, interior, harold, ickes, also, opposed, the, project, citing, its, high, per, family, cost, arthurdale, continued, to, sink, as, a, government, spending, priority, for, the, federal, government, until, 1941, when, the, u, s, sold, off, the, last, of, its, holdings, in, the, community, at, a, loss, later, commentators, generally, described, the, arthurdale, experiment, as, a, failure, roosevelt, herself, was, sharply, discouraged, by, a, 1940, visit, in, which, she, felt, the, town, had, become, excessively, dependent, on, outside, assistance, however, the, residents, considered, the, town, a, utopia, compared, to, their, previous, circumstances, and, many, were, returned, to, economic, self, sufficiency, roosevelt, personally, considered, the, project, a, success, later, speaking, of, the, improvements, she, saw, in, people, s, lives, there, and, stating, i, don, t, know, whether, you, think, that, is, worth, half, a, million, dollars, but, i, do, roosevelt, is, seen, by, historians, as, having, been, significantly, more, advanced, than, her, husband, on, civil, rights, during, franklin, s, administration, roosevelt, became, an, important, connection, to, the, african, american, population, in, the, era, of, segregation, despite, the, president, s, desire, to, placate, southern, sentiment, roosevelt, was, vocal, in, her, support, of, the, civil, rights, movement, after, her, experience, with, arthurdale, and, her, inspections, of, new, deal, programs, in, southern, states, she, concluded, that, new, deal, programs, were, discriminating, against, african, americans, who, received, a, disproportionately, small, share, of, relief, money, roosevelt, became, one, of, the, only, voices, in, her, husband, s, administration, insisting, that, benefits, be, equally, extended, to, americans, of, all, races, roosevelt, also, broke, with, tradition, by, inviting, hundreds, of, african, american, guests, to, the, white, house, in, 1936, she, became, aware, of, conditions, at, the, national, training, school, for, girls, a, predominantly, black, reform, school, once, located, in, the, palisades, neighborhood, of, washington, d, c, she, visited, the, school, wrote, about, it, in, her, my, day, column, lobbied, for, additional, funding, and, pressed, for, changes, in, staffing, and, curriculum, her, white, house, invitation, to, the, students, became, an, issue, in, franklin, s, 1936, re, election, campaign, when, the, black, singer, marian, anderson, was, denied, the, use, of, washington, s, constitution, hall, by, the, daughters, of, the, american, revolution, in, 1939, roosevelt, resigned, from, the, group, in, protest, and, helped, arrange, another, concert, on, the, steps, of, the, lincoln, memorial, african, american, author, zora, neale, hurston, criticized, roosevelt, however, for, failing, to, challenge, the, decision, of, the, board, of, education, of, dc, now, called, the, district, of, columbia, state, board, of, education, to, simultaneously, deny, anderson, a, singing, venue, at, the, auditorium, of, the, all, white, central, high, school, as, far, as, the, high, school, auditorium, is, concerned, hurston, declared, to, jump, the, people, responsible, for, racial, bias, would, be, to, accuse, and, expose, the, accusers, themselves, the, district, of, columbia, has, no, home, rule, it, is, controlled, by, congressional, committees, and, congress, at, the, time, was, overwhelmingly, democratic, it, was, controlled, by, the, very, people, who, were, screaming, so, loudly, against, the, dar, to, my, way, of, thinking, both, places, should, have, been, denounced, or, neither, the, board, retained, its, policy, of, exclusion, long, after, anderson, s, concert, at, the, lincoln, memorial, roosevelt, later, presented, anderson, to, the, king, and, queen, of, the, united, kingdom, after, anderson, performed, at, a, white, house, dinner, roosevelt, also, arranged, the, appointment, of, african, american, educator, mary, mcleod, bethune, with, whom, she, had, struck, up, a, friendship, as, director, of, the, division, of, negro, affairs, of, the, national, youth, administration, to, avoid, problems, with, the, staff, when, bethune, would, visit, the, white, house, roosevelt, would, meet, her, at, the, gate, embrace, her, and, walk, in, with, her, arm, in, arm, she, was, involved, by, being, the, eyes, and, the, ears, of, the, new, deal, she, looked, to, the, future, and, was, committed, to, social, reform, one, of, those, programs, helped, working, women, receive, better, wages, the, new, deal, also, placed, women, into, less, machine, work, and, more, white, collar, work, women, did, not, have, to, work, in, the, factories, making, war, supplies, because, men, were, coming, home, so, they, could, take, over, the, long, days, and, nights, women, had, been, working, to, contribute, to, the, war, efforts, roosevelt, brought, unprecedented, activism, and, ability, to, the, role, of, the, first, lady, in, contrast, to, her, usual, support, of, african, american, rights, the, sundown, town, eleanor, in, west, virginia, was, named, for, her, and, was, established, in, 1934, when, she, and, franklin, visited, the, county, and, developed, it, as, a, test, site, for, families, as, a, sundown, town, like, other, franklin, roosevelt, towns, around, the, nation, such, as, greenbelt, greenhills, greendale, hanford, or, norris, it, was, for, whites, only, it, was, established, as, a, new, deal, project, roosevelt, lobbied, behind, the, scenes, for, the, 1934, costigan, wagner, bill, to, make, lynching, a, federal, crime, including, arranging, a, meeting, between, franklin, and, naacp, president, walter, francis, white, fearing, he, would, lose, the, votes, of, southern, congressional, delegations, for, his, legislative, agenda, however, franklin, refused, to, publicly, support, the, bill, which, proved, unable, to, pass, the, senate, in, 1942, roosevelt, worked, with, activist, pauli, murray, to, persuade, franklin, to, appeal, on, behalf, of, sharecropper, odell, waller, convicted, of, killing, a, white, farmer, during, a, fight, though, franklin, sent, a, letter, to, virginia, governor, colgate, darden, urging, him, to, commute, the, sentence, to, life, imprisonment, waller, was, executed, as, scheduled, roosevelt, s, support, of, african, american, rights, made, her, an, unpopular, figure, among, whites, in, the, south, rumors, spread, of, eleanor, clubs, formed, by, servants, to, oppose, their, employers, and, eleanor, tuesdays, on, which, african, american, men, would, knock, down, white, women, on, the, street, though, no, evidence, has, ever, been, found, of, either, practice, when, race, riots, broke, out, in, detroit, in, june, 1943, critics, in, both, the, north, and, south, wrote, that, roosevelt, was, to, blame, at, the, same, time, she, grew, so, popular, among, african, americans, previously, a, reliable, republican, voting, bloc, that, they, became, a, consistent, base, of, support, for, the, democratic, party, during, the, war, however, roosevelt, failed, to, help, labor, leader, a, philip, randolph, after, e, h, crump, the, democratic, boss, of, memphis, and, a, close, ally, and, friend, of, the, president, quite, openly, violated, his, constitutional, rights, in, 1943, randolph, had, launched, a, personal, campaign, for, free, speech, in, memphis, in, response, to, crump, s, use, of, strong, arm, and, political, pressure, tactics, to, drive, two, prominent, local, black, republicans, j, b, martin, and, randolph, s, friend, robert, church, jr, from, the, city, when, randolph, came, to, the, city, crump, had, denied, him, venues, and, intimidated, local, black, leaders, by, threatening, them, with, jail, into, withdrawing, speaking, invitations, randolph, urged, roosevelt, who, had, also, friendly, political, ties, with, crump, to, do, something, to, counter, crump, s, fascist, denial, of, free, speech, but, she, refused, her, reply, to, randolph, on, december, 18, read, in, full, i, referred, your, letter, to, a, friend, of, mine, when, i, received, it, and, i, am, sorry, it, has, not, been, answered, before, i, was, advised, not, to, do, anything, as, it, might, do, more, harm, than, good, following, the, japanese, attack, on, pearl, harbor, on, december, 7, 1941, roosevelt, spoke, out, against, japanese, american, prejudice, warning, against, the, great, hysteria, against, minority, groups, she, also, privately, opposed, her, husband, s, executive, order, 9066, which, required, japanese, americans, in, many, areas, of, the, u, s, to, enter, internment, camps, she, was, widely, criticized, for, her, defense, of, japanese, american, citizens, including, a, call, by, the, los, angeles, times, that, she, be, forced, to, retire, from, public, life, over, her, stand, on, the, issue, on, may, 21, 1937, roosevelt, visited, westmoreland, homesteads, to, mark, the, arrival, of, the, community, s, final, homesteader, accompanying, her, on, the, trip, was, elinor, morgenthau, the, wife, of, henry, morgenthau, jr, the, president, s, secretary, of, the, treasury, i, am, no, believer, in, paternalism, i, do, not, like, charities, eleanor, roosevelt, had, said, earlier, but, cooperative, communities, such, as, westmoreland, homesteads, she, went, on, offered, an, alternative, to, our, rather, settled, ideas, that, could, provide, equality, of, opportunity, for, all, and, prevent, the, recurrence, of, a, similar, disaster, in, the, future, residents, were, so, taken, by, her, personal, expression, of, interest, in, the, program, that, they, promptly, agreed, to, rename, the, community, in, her, honor, the, new, town, name, norvelt, was, a, combination, of, the, last, syllables, in, her, names, eleanor, roosevelt, the, norvelt, firefighter, s, hall, is, named, roosevelt, hall, in, her, honor, roosevelt, was, an, unprecedentedly, outspoken, first, lady, who, made, far, more, use, of, the, media, than, her, predecessors, she, held, 348, press, conferences, over, the, span, of, her, husband, s, 12, year, presidency, inspired, by, her, relationship, with, hickok, roosevelt, placed, a, ban, on, male, reporters, attending, the, press, conferences, effectively, forcing, newspapers, to, keep, female, reporters, on, staff, in, order, to, cover, them, she, relaxed, the, rule, only, once, on, her, return, from, her, 1943, pacific, trip, because, the, gridiron, club, banned, women, from, its, annual, gridiron, dinner, for, journalists, roosevelt, hosted, a, competing, event, for, female, reporters, at, the, white, house, which, she, called, gridiron, widows, she, was, interviewed, by, many, newspapers, the, new, orleans, journalist, iris, kelso, described, roosevelt, as, her, most, interesting, interviewee, ever, in, the, early, days, of, her, all, female, press, conferences, she, said, they, would, not, address, politics, legislation, or, executive, decision, since, the, role, of, the, first, lady, was, expected, to, be, non, political, at, that, time, she, also, agreed, at, first, that, she, would, avoid, discussing, her, views, on, pending, congressional, measures, still, the, press, conferences, provided, a, welcome, opportunity, for, the, women, reporters, to, speak, directly, with, the, first, lady, access, that, had, been, unavailable, in, previous, administrations, just, before, franklin, assumed, the, presidency, in, february, 1933, roosevelt, published, an, editorial, in, the, women, s, daily, news, that, conflicted, so, sharply, with, his, intended, public, spending, policies, that, he, published, a, rejoinder, in, the, following, issue, on, entering, the, white, house, she, signed, a, contract, with, the, magazine, woman, s, home, companion, to, provide, a, monthly, column, in, which, she, answered, mail, sent, to, her, by, readers, the, feature, was, canceled, in, 1936, as, another, presidential, election, approached, she, continued, her, articles, in, other, venues, publishing, more, than, sixty, articles, in, national, magazines, during, her, tenure, as, first, lady, roosevelt, also, began, a, syndicated, newspaper, column, titled, my, day, which, appeared, six, days, a, week, from, 1936, to, her, death, in, 1962, in, the, column, she, wrote, about, her, daily, activities, but, also, her, humanitarian, concerns, hickok, and, george, t, bye, roosevelt, s, literary, agent, encouraged, her, to, write, the, column, from, 1941, to, her, death, in, 1962, she, also, wrote, an, advice, column, if, you, ask, me, first, published, in, ladies, home, journal, and, then, later, in, mccall, s, a, selection, of, her, columns, was, compiled, in, the, book, if, you, ask, me, essential, advice, from, eleanor, roosevelt, in, 2018, beasley, has, argued, that, roosevelt, s, publications, which, often, dealt, with, women, s, issues, and, invited, reader, responses, represented, a, conscious, attempt, to, use, journalism, to, overcome, social, isolation, for, women, by, making, public, communication, a, two, way, channel, roosevelt, also, made, extensive, use, of, radio, she, was, not, the, first, first, lady, to, broadcast, her, predecessor, lou, henry, hoover, had, done, that, already, but, hoover, did, not, have, a, regular, radio, program, whereas, roosevelt, did, she, first, broadcast, her, own, programs, of, radio, commentary, beginning, on, july, 9, 1934, on, that, first, show, she, talked, about, the, effect, of, movies, on, children, the, need, for, a, censor, who, could, make, sure, movies, did, not, glorify, crime, and, violence, and, her, opinion, about, the, recent, all, star, baseball, game, she, also, read, a, commercial, from, a, mattress, company, which, sponsored, the, broadcast, she, said, she, would, not, accept, any, salary, for, being, on, the, air, and, that, she, would, donate, the, amount, 3, 000, to, charity, later, that, year, in, november, 1934, she, broadcast, a, series, of, programs, about, children, s, education, it, was, heard, on, the, cbs, radio, network, sponsored, by, a, typewriter, company, roosevelt, once, again, donated, the, money, giving, it, to, the, american, friends, service, committee, to, help, with, a, school, it, operated, during, 1934, roosevelt, set, a, record, for, the, most, times, a, first, lady, had, spoken, on, radio, she, spoke, as, a, guest, on, other, people, s, programs, as, well, as, the, host, of, her, own, for, a, total, of, 28, times, that, year, in, 1935, roosevelt, continued, to, host, programs, aimed, at, the, female, audience, including, one, called, it, s, a, woman, s, world, each, time, she, donated, the, money, she, earned, to, charity, the, association, of, a, sponsor, with, the, popular, first, lady, resulted, in, increases, in, sales, for, that, company, when, the, selby, shoe, company, sponsored, a, series, of, roosevelt, s, programs, sales, increased, by, 200, the, fact, that, her, programs, were, sponsored, created, controversy, with, her, husband, s, political, enemies, expressing, skepticism, about, whether, she, really, did, donate, her, salary, to, charity, they, accused, her, of, profiteering, but, her, radio, programs, proved, to, be, so, popular, with, listeners, that, the, criticisms, had, little, effect, she, continued, to, broadcast, throughout, the, 1930s, sometimes, on, cbs, and, sometimes, on, nbc, on, may, 10, 1940, germany, invaded, belgium, luxembourg, and, the, netherlands, marking, the, end, of, the, relatively, conflict, free, phoney, war, phase, of, world, war, ii, as, the, u, s, began, to, move, toward, war, footing, roosevelt, found, herself, again, depressed, fearing, that, her, role, in, fighting, for, domestic, justice, would, become, extraneous, in, a, nation, focused, on, foreign, affairs, she, briefly, considered, traveling, to, europe, to, work, with, the, red, cross, but, was, dissuaded, by, presidential, advisers, who, pointed, out, the, consequences, should, the, president, s, wife, be, captured, as, a, prisoner, of, war, she, soon, found, other, wartime, causes, to, work, on, however, beginning, with, a, popular, movement, to, allow, the, immigration, of, european, refugee, children, she, also, lobbied, her, husband, to, allow, greater, immigration, of, groups, persecuted, by, the, nazis, including, jews, but, fears, of, fifth, columnists, caused, franklin, to, restrict, immigration, rather, than, expanding, it, roosevelt, successfully, secured, political, refugee, status, for, eighty, three, jewish, refugees, from, the, s, s, quanza, in, august, 1940, but, was, refused, on, many, other, occasions, her, son, james, later, wrote, that, her, deepest, regret, at, the, end, of, her, life, was, that, she, had, not, forced, franklin, to, accept, more, refugees, from, nazism, during, the, war, roosevelt, was, also, active, on, the, home, front, beginning, in, 1941, she, co, chaired, the, office, of, civilian, defense, ocd, with, new, york, city, mayor, fiorello, h, laguardia, working, to, give, civilian, volunteers, expanded, roles, in, war, preparations, she, soon, found, herself, in, a, power, struggle, with, laguardia, who, preferred, to, focus, on, narrower, aspects, of, defense, while, she, saw, solutions, to, broader, social, problems, as, equally, important, to, the, war, effort, though, laguardia, resigned, from, the, ocd, in, december, 1941, roosevelt, was, forced, to, resign, following, anger, in, the, house, of, representatives, over, high, salaries, for, several, ocd, appointments, including, two, of, her, close, friends, also, in, 1941, the, short, film, women, in, defense, written, by, roosevelt, was, released, it, was, produced, by, the, office, of, emergency, management, and, briefly, outlines, the, way, in, which, women, could, help, prepare, the, country, for, the, possibility, of, war, there, is, also, a, segment, on, the, types, of, costumes, women, would, wear, while, engaged, in, war, work, at, the, end, of, the, film, the, narrator, explains, women, are, vital, to, securing, a, healthy, american, home, life, and, raising,

building, tour, of, which, admiral, william, halsey, jr, later, said, she, alone, accomplished, more, good, than, any, other, person, or, any, groups, of, civilians, who, had, passed, through, my, area, for, her, part, roosevelt, was, left, shaken, and, deeply, depressed, by, seeing, the, war, s, carnage, a, number, of, congressional, republicans, criticized, her, for, using, scarce, wartime, resources, for, her, trip, prompting, franklin, to, suggest, that, she, take, a, break, from, traveling, roosevelt, supported, increased, roles, for, women, and, african, americans, in, the, war, effort, and, began, to, advocate, for, women, to, be, given, factory, jobs, a, year, before, it, became, a, widespread, practice, in, 1942, she, urged, women, of, all, social, backgrounds, to, learn, trades, saying, if, i, were, of, a, debutante, age, i, would, go, into, a, factory, any, factory, where, i, could, learn, a, skill, and, be, useful, roosevelt, learned, of, the, high, rate, of,

was, anna, who, told, her, that, franklin, had, been, with, rutherfurd, when, he, died, in, addition, she, told, her, that, franklin, had, continued, the, relationship, for, decades, and, people,
