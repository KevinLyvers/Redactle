to, charlotte, s, memoirs, believed, to, have, had, a, major, effect, on, the, young, robespierre, around, 1767, for, unknown, reasons, his, father, left, the, children, his, two, daughters, were, raised, by, their, paternal, maiden, aunts, and, his, two, sons, by, their, maternal, grandparents, demonstrating, literacy, at, an, early, age, maximilien, commenced, his, education, at, the, coll,

in, paris, among, his, peers, were, camille, desmoulins, and, stanislas, fr, ron, during, his, schooling, he, developed, a, profound, admiration, for, the, roman, republic, and, the, rhetoric, skills, of, cicero, cato, and, lucius, junius, brutus, in, 1776, he, earned, the, first, prize, for, rhetoric, his, appreciation, for, the, classics, inspired, him, to, aspire, to, roman, virtues, particularly, the, embodiment, of, rousseau, s, citizen, soldier, robespierre, was, drawn, to, the, concepts, of, the, influential, philosophe, regarding, political, reforms, expounded, in, his, work, contrat, social, aligning, with, rousseau, he, considered, the, general, will, of, the, people, as, the, foundation, of, political, legitimacy, robespierre, s, vision, of, revolutionary, virtue, and, his, strategy, for, establishing, political, authority, through, direct, democracy, can, be, traced, back, to, the, ideologies, of, montesquieu, and, mably, while, some, claim, robespierre, coincidentally, met, rousseau, before, the, latter, s, passing, others, argue, that, this, account, was, apocryphal, during, his, three, year, study, of, law, at, the, sorbonne, robespierre, distinguished, himself, academically, culminating, in, his, graduation, in, july, 1780, where, he, received, a, special, prize, of, 600, livres, for, his, exceptional, academic, achievements, and, exemplary, conduct, admitted, to, the, bar, he, was, appointed, as, one, of, the, five, judges, in, the, local, criminal, court, in, march, 1782, however, robespierre, soon, resigned, due, to, his, ethical, discomfort, in, adjudicating, capital, cases, stemming, from, his, opposition, to, the, death, penalty, robespierre, was, elected, to, the, literary, academy, of, arras, in, november, 1783, the, following, year, the, academy, of, metz, honored, him, with, a, medal, for, his, essay, pondering, collective, punishment, thus, establishing, him, as, literary, figure, pierre, louis, de, lacretelle, and, robespierre, shared, the, prize, in, 1786, robespierre, passionately, addressed, inequality, before, the, law, criticizing, the, indignities, faced, by, illegitimate, or, natural, children, and, later, denouncing, practices, like, lettres, de, cachet, imprisonment, without, a, trial, and, the, marginalization, of, women, in, academic, circles, robespierre, s, social, circle, expanded, to, include, influential, figures, such, as, the, lawyer, martial, herman, the, officer, and, engineer, lazare, carnot, and, the, teacher, joseph, fouch, all, of, whom, would, hold, significance, in, his, later, endeavors, his, role, as, the, secretary, of, the, academy, of, arras, connected, him, with, fran, ois, no, l, babeuf, a, revolutionary, land, surveyor, in, the, region, in, august, 1788, king, louis, xvi, declared, new, elections, for, all, provinces, and, summoned, the, estates, general, to, convene, on, 1, may, 1789, aiming, to, address, france, s, grave, financial, and, taxation, woes, engaging, in, discussions, on, the, selection, of, the, french, provincial, government, robespierre, advocated, in, his, address, to, the, nation, of, artois, that, reverting, to, the, former, mode, of, election, by, the, members, of, the, provincial, estates, would, fail, to, adequately, represent, the, people, of, france, in, the, new, estates, general, in, his, electoral, district, robespierre, began, to, assert, his, influence, in, politics, through, his, notice, to, the, residents, of, the, countryside, in, 1789, targeting, local, authorities, and, garnering, the, support, of, rural, electors, this, move, solidified, his, position, among, the, country, s, electors, on, 26, april, 1789, robespierre, secured, his, place, as, one, of, 16, deputies, representing, french, flanders, in, the, estates, general, on, 6, june, robespierre, delivered, his, maiden, speech, targeting, the, hierarchical, structure, of, the, church, his, impassioned, oratory, prompted, observers, to, comment, this, young, man, is, as, yet, unexperienced, unaware, of, when, to, cease, but, possesses, an, eloquence, that, sets, him, apart, from, the, rest, by, 13, june, robespierre, aligned, with, deputies, who, later, proclaimed, themselves, the, national, assembly, asserting, representation, for, 96, of, the, nation, on, 9, july, the, assembly, relocated, to, paris, and, began, deliberating, a, new, constitution, and, taxation, system, on, 13, july, the, national, assembly, proposed, reinstating, the, bourgeois, militia, in, paris, to, quell, the, unrest, the, following, day, the, populace, demanded, weapons, and, stormed, both, the, h, tel, des, invalides, and, the, bastille, the, local, militia, transitioned, into, the, national, guard, a, move, that, distanced, the, most, impoverished, citizens, from, active, involvement, during, the, discussions, and, an, altercation, with, lally, tollendal, who, advocated, for, law, and, order, robespierre, reminded, the, citizens, of, their, recent, defense, of, liberty, which, paradoxically, restricted, their, access, to, it, in, october, alongside, louvet, robespierre, supported, maillard, following, the, women, s, march, on, versailles, initially, the, group, of, female, protesters, conveyed, a, relatively, conciliatory, message, yet, their, ranks, were, soon, reinforced, by, more, militarized, and, seasoned, male, factions, upon, reaching, versailles, while, the, constituent, assembly, deliberated, on, male, census, suffrage, on, 22, october, robespierre, and, a, select, few, deputies, opposed, the, property, prerequisites, for, voting, and, holding, office, through, december, and, january, robespierre, notably, drew, attention, from, marginalized, groups, particularly, protestants, jews, individuals, of, african, descent, domestic, servants, and, actors, as, a, frequent, orator, in, the, assembly, robespierre, championed, the, ideals, encapsulated, in, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, and, of, the, citizen, 1789, and, advocated, for, constitutional, provisions, outlined, in, the, constitution, of, 1791, however, according, to, malcolm, crook, his, views, rarely, garnered, majority, support, among, fellow, deputies, despite, his, commitment, to, democratic, principles, robespierre, persistently, donned, a, culotte, and, retained, a, meticulously, groomed, appearance, with, powdered, curled, and, perfumed, hair, some, accounts, described, him, as, nervous, timid, and, suspicious, madame, de, sta, l, portrayed, robespierre, as, someone, very, exaggerated, in, his, democratic, principles, and, maintained, the, most, absurd, propositions, with, a, coolness, that, had, the, air, of, conviction, in, october, he, assumed, the, role, of, a, judge, at, the, versailles, tribunal, following, the, 5, october, women, s, march, on, versailles, and, the, forcible, relocation, of, the, king, and, national, constituent, assembly, from, versailles, to, paris, robespierre, lived, at, 30, rue, de, saintonge, in, le, marais, a, district, with, relatively, wealthy, inhabitants, he, shared, an, apartment, on, the, third, floor, with, pierre, villiers, who, was, his, secretary, for, several, months, robespierre, associated, with, the, new, society, of, the, friends, of, the, constitution, commonly, known, as, the, jacobin, club, originally, this, organisation, the, club, breton, comprised, only, deputies, from, brittany, but, after, the, national, assembly, had, moved, to, paris, the, group, admitted, non, deputies, among, these, 1, 200, men, robespierre, found, a, sympathetic, audience, equality, before, the, law, was, the, keystone, of, the, jacobin, ideology, beginning, in, october, and, continuing, through, january, he, made, several, speeches, in, response, to, proposals, for, property, qualifications, for, voting, and, officeholding, under, the, proposed, constitution, this, was, a, position, he, vigorously, opposed, arguing, in, a, speech, on, 22, october, the, position, that, he, derived, from, rousseau, sovereignty, resides, in, the, people, in, all, the, individuals, of, the, people, each, individual, therefore, has, the, right, to, participate, in, making, the, law, which, governs, him, and, in, the, administration, of, the, public, good, which, is, his, own, if, not, it, is, not, true, that, all, men, are, equal, in, rights, that, every, man, is, a, citizen, during, the, continuing, debate, on, suffrage, robespierre, ended, his, speech, of, 25, january, 1790, with, a, blunt, assertion, that, all, frenchmen, must, be, admissible, to, all, public, positions, without, any, other, distinction, than, that, of, virtues, and, talents, on, 31, march, 1790, robespierre, was, elected, as, their, president, on, 28, april, robespierre, proposed, to, allow, an, equal, number, of, officers, and, soldiers, in, the, court, martial, robespierre, supported, the, cooperation, of, all, the, national, guards, in, a, general, federation, on, 11, may, on, 19, june, he, was, elected, secretary, of, the, national, assembly, in, july, robespierre, demanded, fraternal, equality, in, salaries, before, the, end, of, the, year, he, was, seen, as, one, of, the, leaders, of, the, small, body, of, the, extreme, left, robespierre, was, one, of, the, thirty, voices, on, 5, december, robespierre, delivered, a, speech, on, the, urgent, topic, of, the, national, guard, to, be, armed, for, personal, defence, is, the, right, of, every, man, to, be, armed, to, defend, freedom, and, the, existence, of, the, common, fatherland, is, the, right, of, every, citizen, robespierre, coined, the, famous, motto, libert, galit, fraternit, by, adding, the, word, fraternity, on, the, flags, of, the, national, guard, in, 1791, robespierre, gave, 328, speeches, almost, one, a, day, on, 28, january, robespierre, discussed, in, the, assembly, the, organisation, of, the, national, guard, for, three, years, a, hot, topic, in, french, newspapers, in, early, march, provincial, militias, were, abolished, and, the, paris, d, partment, was, placed, above, the, commune, in, all, matters, of, general, order, and, security, on, 27, and, 28, april, robespierre, opposed, plans, to, reorganise, the, national, guard, and, restrict, its, membership, to, active, citizens, which, was, regarded, as, too, aristocratic, he, demanded, the, reconstitution, of, the, national, guard, on, a, democratic, basis, to, abolish, the, use, of, decorations, and, to, allow, an, equal, number, of, officers, and, soldiers, in, the, court, martial, he, felt, that, the, national, guard, had, to, become, the, instrument, of, defending, liberty, and, no, longer, be, a, threat, to, it, in, the, same, month, robespierre, published, a, pamphlet, in, which, he, argued, the, case, for, universal, manhood, suffrage, on, 15, may, the, constituent, assembly, declared, full, and, equal, citizenship, for, all, free, people, of, color, in, the, debate, robespierre, said, i, feel, that, i, am, here, to, defend, the, rights, of, men, i, cannot, consent, to, any, amendment, and, i, ask, that, the, principle, be, adopted, in, its, entirety, he, descended, from, the, rostrum, in, the, middle, of, the, repeated, applause, of, the, left, and, of, all, the, tribunes, on, 16, 18, may, when, the, elections, began, robespierre, proposed, and, carried, the, motion, that, no, deputy, who, sat, in, the, constituent, assembly, could, sit, in, the, succeeding, legislative, assembly, a, tactical, purpose, of, this, self, denying, ordinance, was, to, block, the, ambitions, of, the, old, leaders, of, the, jacobins, antoine, barnave, adrien, duport, and, alexandre, de, lameth, aspiring, to, create, a, constitutional, monarchy, roughly, similar, to, that, of, england, on, 28, may, robespierre, proposed, all, frenchmen, should, be, declared, active, citizens, and, eligible, to, vote, on, 30, may, he,

principles, their, modest, ways, of, living, and, their, refusal, of, bribes, his, steadfast, adherence, and, defence, of, the, views, he, expressed, earned, him, the, nickname, l, incorruptible, according, to, his, friend, the, surgeon, joseph, souberbielle, joachim, vilate, and, duplay, s, daughter, lisabeth, robespierre, became, engaged, to, duplay, s, eldest, daughter, l, onore, but, his,

the, society, of, friends, of, the, constitution, which, was, held, on, sundays, on, 28, november, he, was, back, in, the, jacobin, club, where, he, met, with, a, triumphant, reception, collot, d, herbois, gave, his, chair, to, robespierre, who, presided, that, evening, on, 5, december, he, gave, a, speech, on, the, organization, of, the, garde, national, which, he, saw, as, a, unique, institution, born, from, the, ideals, of, the, french, revolution, on, 11, december, robespierre, was, finally, installed, as, accusateur, public, in, january, 1791, robespierre, promoted, the, idea, not, only, the, national, guard, but, also, the, people, had, to, be, armed, the, jacobins, decided, his, speech, would, not, be, printed, the, declaration, of, pillnitz, 27, august, 1791, from, austria, and, prussia, warned, the, people, of, france, not, to, harm, louis, xvi, or, these, nations, would, militarily, intervene, brissot, rallied, the, support, of, the, legislative, assembly, as, jean, paul, marat, georges, danton, and, robespierre, were, not, elected, in, the, new, legislature, thanks, to, the, self, denying, ordinance, oppositional, politics, often, took, place, outside, the, assembly, on, 18, december, 1791, robespierre, gave, a, second, speech, at, the, jacobin, club, against, the, declaration, of, war, robespierre, warned, against, the, threat, of, dictatorship, stemming, from, war, if, they, are, caesars, catilines, or, cromwells, they, seize, power, for, themselves, if, they, are, spineless, courtiers, uninterested, in, doing, good, yet, dangerous, when, they, seek, to, do, harm, they, go, back, to, lay, their, power, at, their, master, s, feet, and, help, him, to, resume, arbitrary, power, on, condition, they, become, his, chief, servants, at, the, end, of, december, guadet, the, chairman, of, the, assembly, suggested, that, a, war, would, be, a, benefit, to, the, nation, and, boost, the, economy, he, urged, that, france, should, declare, war, against, austria, marat, and, robespierre, opposed, him, arguing, that, victory, would, create, a, dictatorship, while, defeat, would, restore, the, king, to, his, former, powers, the, most, extravagant, idea, that, can, arise, in, a, politician, s, head, is, to, believe, that, it, is, enough, for, a, people, to, invade, a, foreign, country, to, make, it, adopt, its, laws, and, their, constitution, no, one, loves, armed, missionaries, the, declaration, of, the, rights, of, man, is, not, a, lightning, bolt, that, strikes, every, throne, at, the, same, time, i, am, far, from, claiming, that, our, revolution, will, not, eventually, influence, the, fate, of, the, world, but, i, say, that, it, will, not, be, today, 2, january, 1792, this, opposition, from, expected, allies, irritated, the, girondins, and, the, war, became, a, major, point, of, contention, between, the, factions, in, his, third, speech, on, the, war, robespierre, countered, on, 25, january, 1792, in, the, jacobin, club, a, revolutionary, war, must, be, waged, to, free, subjects, and, slaves, from, unjust, tyranny, not, for, the, traditional, reasons, of, defending, dynasties, and, expanding, frontiers, robespierre, argued, such, a, war, could, only, favour, the, forces, of, counter, revolution, since, it, would, play, into, the, hands, of, those, who, opposed, the, sovereignty, of, the, people, the, risks, of, caesarism, were, clear, in, troubled, periods, of, history, generals, often, became, the, arbiters, of, the, fate, of, their, countries, already, robespierre, knew, that, he, had, lost, as, he, failed, to, gather, a, majority, his, speech, was, nevertheless, published, and, sent, to, all, clubs, and, jacobin, societies, of, france, on, 10, february, 1792, robespierre, gave, a, speech, on, how, to, save, the, state, and, liberty, and, did, not, use, the, word, war, he, began, by, assuring, his, audience, that, everything, he, intended, to, propose, was, strictly, constitutional, he, then, went, on, to, advocate, specific, measures, to, strengthen, not, so, much, the, national, defenses, as, the, forces, that, could, be, relied, on, to, defend, the, revolution, robespierre, promoted, a, people, s, army, continuously, under, arms, and, able, to, impose, its, will, on, feuillants, and, girondins, in, the, constitutional, cabinet, of, louis, xvi, and, the, legislative, assembly, the, jacobins, decided, to, study, his, speech, before, deciding, whether, it, should, be, printed, on, 15, february, robespierre, failed, to, get, elected, in, the, city, council, conseil, g, n, ral, on, the, same, day, the, installation, of, the, criminal, trial, court, of, the, department, of, paris, took, place, for, robespierre, it, was, an, ungrateful, position, as, public, accuser, it, meant, he, was, not, allowed, to, the, bar, before, the, jury, had, spoken, their, verdict, robespierre, was, responsible, for, the, coordination, of, the, local, and, the, federal, police, in, the, department, and, the, sections, on, 26, march, guadet, accused, robespierre, of, superstition, relying, on, divine, providence, shortly, after, robespierre, was, accused, by, brissot, and, guadet, of, trying, to, become, the, idol, of, the, people, being, against, the, war, robespierre, was, also, accused, of, acting, as, a, secret, agent, for, the, austrian, committee, the, girondins, planned, strategies, to, out, maneuver, robespierre, s, influence, among, the, jacobins, on, 27, april, as, part, of, his, speech, responding, to, the, accusations, by, brissot, and, guadet, against, him, he, threatened, to, leave, the, jacobins, claiming, he, preferred, to, continue, his, mission, as, an, ordinary, citizen, on, 17, may, robespierre, released, the, first, issue, of, his, weekly, periodical, le, d, fenseur, de, la, constitution, the, defender, of, the, constitution, in, this, publication, he, criticized, brissot, and, expressed, his, skepticism, over, the, war, movement, the, periodical, printed, by, his, neighbor, nicolas, served, multiple, purposes, to, print, his, speeches, to, counter, the, influence, of, the, royal, court, in, public, policy, and, to, defend, him, from, the, accusations, of, girondist, leaders, for, albert, soboul, its, purpose, was, to, give, voice, to, the, economic, and, democratic, interests, of, the, broader, masses, in, paris, and, defend, their, rights, when, the, legislative, assembly, declared, war, against, austria, on, 20, april, 1792, robespierre, stated, that, the, french, people, must, arm, themselves,

december, by, the, law, of, revolutionary, government, the, independence, of, departmental, and, local, authorities, came, to, an, end, when, extensive, powers, of, the, committee, of, public, safety,

school, friend, remember, the, lessons, of, history, and, philosophy, love, is, stronger, more, lasting, than, fear, on, 25, december, provoked, by, desmoulins, insistent, challenges, robespierre, produced, his, report, on, the, principles, of, revolutionary, government, robespierre, replied, to, the, plea, for, an, end, to, the, terror, justifying, the, collective, authority, of, the, national, convention, administrative, centralisation, and, the, purging, of, local, authorities, he, said, he, had, to, avoid, two, cliffs, indulgence, and, severity, he, could, not, consult, the, 18th, century, political, authors, because, they, had, not, foreseen, such, a, course, of, events, he, protested, against, the, various, factions, that, he, believed, threatened, the, government, such, as, the, h, bertists, and, dantonists, robespierre, strongly, believed, that, the, strict, legal, system, was, still, necessary, the, theory, of, the, revolutionary, government, is, as, new, as, the, revolution, from, which, this, government, was, born, this, theory, may, not, be, found, in, the, books, of, the, political, writers, who, were, unable, to, predict, the, revolution, nor, in, the, law, books, of, the, tyrants, the, goal, of, a, constitutional, government, is, the, protection, of, the, republic, that, of, a, revolutionary, government, is, the, establishment, of, the, republic, the, revolution, is, the, war, waged, by, liberty, against, its, foes, but, the, constitution, is, the, r, gime, of, victorious, and, peaceful, freedom, the, revolutionary, government, will, need, to, put, forth, extraordinary, activity, because, it, is, at, war, it, is, subject, to, no, constant, laws, since, the, circumstances, under, which, it, prevails, are, those, of, a, storm, and, change, with, every, moment, this, government, is, obliged, unceasingly, to, disclose, new, sources, of, energy, to, oppose, the, rapidly, changing, face, of, danger, robespierre, would, suppress, chaos, and, anarchy, the, government, has, to, defend, itself, and, to, the, enemies, of, the, people, it, owes, only, death, according, to, r, r, palmer, and, donald, c, hodges, this, was, the, first, important, statement, in, modern, times, of, a, philosophy, of, dictatorship, others, see, it, as, a, natural, consequence, of, political, instability, and, conspiracy, in, his, report, on, the, principles, of, political, morality, of, 5, february, 1794, robespierre, praised, the, revolutionary, government, and, argued, that, terror, and, virtue, were, necessary, if, the, spring, of, popular, government, in, time, of, peace, is, virtue, the, springs, of, popular, government, in, revolution, are, at, once, virtue, and, terror, virtue, without, which, terror, is, fatal, terror, without, which, virtue, is, powerless, terror, is, nothing, other, than, justice, prompt, severe, inflexible, it, is, therefore, an, emanation, of, virtue, it, is, not, so, much, a, special, principle, as, it, is, a, consequence, of, the, general, principle, of, democracy, applied, to, our, country, s, most, urgent, needs, it, has, been, said, that, terror, is, the, principle, of, despotic, government, does, your, government, therefore, resemble, despotism, yes, as, the, sword, that, gleams, in, the, hands, of, the, heroes, of, liberty, resembles, that, with, which, the, henchmen, of, tyranny, are, armed, let, the, despot, govern, by, terror, his, brutalized, subjects, he, is, right, as, a, despot, subdue, by, terror, the, enemies, of, liberty, and, you, will, be, right, as, founders, of, the, republic, the, government, of, the, revolution, is, liberty, s, despotism, against, tyranny, is, force, made, only, to, protect, crime, and, is, the, thunderbolt, not, destined, to, strike, the, heads, of, the, proud, to, punish, the, oppressors, of, humanity, is, clemency, to, forgive, them, is, barbarity, aulard, sums, up, the, jacobin, train, of, thought, all, politics, according, to, robespierre, must, tend, to, establish, the, reign, of, virtue, and, confound, vice, he, reasoned, thus, those, who, are, virtuous, are, right, error, is, a, corruption, of, the, heart, error, cannot, be, sincere, error, is, always, deliberate, according, to, the, german, journalist, k, e, oelsner, robespierre, behaved, more, like, a, leader, of, a, religious, sect, than, of, a, political, party, he, can, be, eloquent, but, most, of, the, time, he, is, boring, especially, when, he, goes, on, too, long, which, is, often, the, case, from, 13, february, to, 13, march, 1794, robespierre, had, withdrawn, from, active, business, on, the, committee, due, to, illness, robespierre, seems, to, have, suffered, from, acute, physical, and, mental, exhaustion, exacerbated, by, an, austere, personal, regime, according, to, mcphee, saint, just, was, elected, president, of, the, convention, for, the, next, two, weeks, on, 19, february, robespierre, decided, to, return, to, the, duplays, in, early, march, in, a, speech, at, the, cordeliers, club, h, bert, attacked, both, robespierre, and, danton, as, being, too, soft, h, bert, used, the, latest, issue, of, le, p, re, duchesne, to, criticise, robespierre, there, were, queues, and, near, riots, at, the, shops, and, in, the, markets, there, were, strikes, and, threatening, public, demonstrations, some, of, the, h, bertistes, and, their, friends, were, calling, for, a, new, insurrection, robespierre, managed, to, acquire, a, small, army, of, secret, agents, which, reported, to, him, a, majority, of, the, committee, decided, that, the, ultra, left, h, bertists, would, have, to, perish, or, their, opposition, within, the, committee, would, overshadow, the, other, factions, due, to, its, influence, in, the, commune, of, paris, robespierre, also, had, personal, reasons, for, disliking, the, h, bertists, for, their, bloodthirstiness, and, atheism, which, he, associated, with, the, old, aristocracy, on, the, night, of, 13, 14, march, h, bert, and, 18, of, his, followers, were, arrested, as, the, agents, of, foreign, powers, on, 15, march, robespierre, reappeared, in, the, convention, the, next, day, robespierre, denounced, a, petition, demanding, that, all, merchants, should, be, excluded, from, public, offices, whilst, the, war, lasted, subsequently, he, joined, saint, just, in, his, attacks, on, h, bert, the, leaders, of, the, arm, es, r, volutionnaires, were, denounced, by, the, revolutionary, tribunal, as, accomplices, of, h, bert, their, armies, were, dissolved, on, 27, march,

of, 24, march, on, 25, march, condorcet, was, arrested, as, he, was, seen, as, an, enemy, of, the, revolution, he, committed, suicide, two, days, later, on, 29, march, danton, met, again, with, robespierre, privately, on, 30, march, the, two, committees, decided, to, arrest, danton, and, desmoulins, on, 31, march, saint, just, publicly, attacked, both, in, the, convention, criticism, was, voiced, against, the, arrests, which, robespierre, silenced, with, whoever, trembles, at, this, moment, is, guilty, legendre, suggested, that, before, you, listen, to, any, report, you, send, for, the, prisoners, and, hear, them, robespierre, replied, it, would, be, violating, the, laws, of, impartiality, to, grant, to, danton, what, was, refused, to, others, who, had, an, equal, right, to, make, the, same, demand, this, answer, silenced, at, once, all, solicitations, in, his, favour, no, friend, of, the, dantonists, dared, speak, up, in, case, he, too, should, be, accused, of, putting, friendship, before, virtue, danton, desmoulins, and, several, others, faced, trial, from, 3, to, 5, april, before, the, revolutionary, tribunal, presided, over, by, martial, herman, described, as,

the, revolutionary, tribunal, the, accusations, of, theft, corruption, and, the, scandal, involving, the, french, east, india, company, paved, the, way, for, danton, s, downfall, accusing, him, of, conspiracy, with, count, mirabeau, marquis, de, lafayette, the, duke, of, orl, ans, and, dumouriez, in, robespierre, s, eyes, the, dantonists, had, ceased, to, be, true, patriots, instead,

slaveholders, in, the, caribbean, the, colonial, lobby, contented, that, granting, political, rights, to, black, individuals, would, lead, to, france, losing, her, colonies, in, response, robespierre, asserted, we, should, not, compromise, the, interests, humanity, holds, most, dear, the, sacred, rights, of, a, significant, number, of, our, fellow, citizens, later, exclaiming, perish, the,

championed, by, robespierre, and, the, montagnards, was, ratified, in, august, through, a, national, referendum, it, granted, universal, suffrage, to, french, men, and, explicitly, condemned, slavery, however, the, french, constitution, of, 1793, was, never, put, in, effect, starting, in, august, former, slaves, in, st, domingue, were, granted, all, the, rights, of, french, citizens, in, august, 1793, an, increasing, number, of, slaves, in, st, domingue, initiated, a, haitian, revolution, against, slavery, and, colonial, domination, robespierre, however, prioritized, the, rights, of, free, people, of, color, over, those, of, the, enslaved, on, 31, october, 1793, slavery, was, officially, abolished, in, st, domingue, robespierre, criticised, the, actions, of, the, former, governor, of,

on, white, individuals, to, govern, the, colony, in, 1794, the, national, convention, passed, a, decree, abolishing, slavery, in, all, the, colonies, on, the, day, following, the, emancipation, decree, robespierre, addressed, the, convention, lauding, the, french, as, pioneers, to, summon, all, men, to, equality, and, liberty, and, their, full, rights, as, citizens, although, robespierre, mentioned, slavery, twice, in, his, speech, he, did, not, specifically, reference, the, french, colonies, despite, petitions, from, the, slaveholding, delegation, the, convention, resolved, to, fully, endorse, the, decree, however, its, implementation, and, application, were, limited, to, st, domingue, 1793, guadeloupe, december, 1794, and, french, guiana, the, national, convention, declares, the, abolition, of, negro, slavery, in, all, the, colonies, consequently, it, decrees, that, all, men, without, distinction, of, color, domiciled, in, the, colonies, are, french, citizens, and, will, enjoy, all, the, rights, assured, by, the, constitution, robespierre, s, stance, on, the, decree, of, 16, pluviose, year, ii, regarding, the, emancipation, of, the, slaves, remains, a, topic, of, contention, french, historian, claude, mazauric, interpreted, robespierre, s, cautious, approach, in, february, 1794, toward, the, abolition, decree, as, an, attempt, to, avoid, controversy, on, 11, april, 1794, the, decree, underwent, alterations, with, robespierre, endorsing, orders, to, ratify, it, this, decree, significantly, bolstered, the, republic, s, popularity, among, black, individuals, in, st, domingue, many, of, whom, had, already, liberated, themselves, and, sought, military, alliances, to, safeguard, their, freedom, in, may, 1794, toussaint, louverture, aligned, with, the, french, after, the, spanish, declined, to, take, actions, against, slavery, and, in, repelling, the, english, following, the, events, of, 9, 10, thermidor, an, anti, slavery, campaign, emerged, targeting, robespierre, critics, accused, him, of, attempting, to, perpetuate, slavery, despite, its, abolition, by, the, convention, on, 4, february, 1794, following, the, precedent, set, by, sonthonax, s, abolition, decree, in, august, 1793, in, st, domingue, robespierre, s, quest, for, revolutionary, change, extended, beyond, politics, to, his, opposition, to, the, catholic, church, and, its, policies, particularly, clerical, celibacy, despite, denouncing, excesses, in, the, dechristianisation, efforts, of, his, political, adversaries, he, aimed, to, rejuvenate, spirituality, in, france, through, deist, beliefs, on, 6, may, 1794, robespierre, announced, the, committee, of, public, safety, s, recognition, of, the, existence, of, god, and, the, immortality, of, the, human, soul, the, following, day, he, delivered, a, detailed, presentation, to, the, convention, on, religious, and, moral, principles, intertwined, with, republican, ideals, introducing, festivals, dedicated, to, the, supreme, being, and, other, virtues, on, 8, june, during, the, festival, of, the, supreme, being, robespierre, made, his, public, debut, as, a, leader, and, convention, president, expressing, his, passion, for, virtue, nature, and, deist, beliefs, climaxing, at, the, champ, de, mars, he, delivered, speeches, emphasizing, his, concept, of, a, supreme, being, devoid, of, religious, figures, like, christ, or, mohammed, criticism, ensued, with, some, accusing, him, of, aspiring, to, godhood, and, creating, a, new, religion, particularly, after, allegations, of, involvement, in, catherine, th, ot, s, prophecy, conspiracy, the, cult, of, the, supreme, being, he, championed, aroused, suspicion, among, anticlericals, and, political, factions, leading, to, doubts, about, his, grasp, on, reality, and, ultimately, contributing, to, his, downfall, according, to, madame, de, sta, l, this, period, marked, robespierre, s, decline, on, 20, may, robespierre, signed, theresa, cabarrus, s, arrest, warrant, and, on, 23, may, following, an, attempted, assassination, on, collot, d, herbois, c, cile, renault, was, arrested, near, robespierre, s, residence, with, two, penknives, she, was, executed, on, 17, june, robespierre, refused, to, reunite, dispersed, families, in, different, prisons, into, common, detention, facilities, citing, security, concerns, after, the, assassination, attempt, the, law, of, 22, prairial, introduced, on, 10, june, without, consultation, from, the, committee, of, general, security, intensified, the, conflict, between, the, two, committees, and, led, to, a, doubling, of, executions, in, paris, moderate, judges, were, dismissed, robespierre, ensured, only, his, supporters, became, judges, marking, the, beginning, of, the, great, terror, between, 10, june, and, 27, july, another, 1, 366, were, executed, there, was, widespread, agreement, among, deputies, that, their, parliamentary, immunity, in, place, since, 1, april, 1793, had, become, perilous, on, 11, june, robespierre, accused, fouch, of, leading, a, conspiracy, and, on, 12, june, he, appeared, in, the, convention, to, denounce, his, opponents, for, trying, to, turn, the, montagnards, against, the, government, claiming, a, conspiracy, to, discredit, him, facing, minority, opposition, on, 12, and, 13, june, robespierre, withdrew, vowing, not, to, return, to, the, committee, while, the, conflict, persisted, his, presidency, of, the, convention, ended, on, 18, june, robespierre, also, censured, the, journalists, of, the, moniteur, universel, by, the, end, of, june, saint, just, realizing, robespierre, s, political, decline, was, recalled, hastily, robespierre, s, deteriorating, health, and, increasing, irrationality, led, to, calls, for, more, purges, ultimately, losing, him, favor, within, the, committees, carnot, described, saint, just, and, robespierre, as, ridiculous, dictators, on, 1, july, robespierre, addressed, the, jacobin, club, denouncing, slanders, against, him, in, london, and, paris, he, stormed, out, of, a, committee, meeting, on, 3, july, expressing, resignation, from, saving, the, country, without, his, involvement, the, following, day, he, lamented, his, failing, health, and, excluded, tallien, from, the, jacobin, club, on, 14, july, robespierre, had, fouch, expelled, he, rarely, appeared, in, the, convention, for, forty, days, but, signed, decrees, by, the, committee, of, public, safety, he, stopped, working, with, the, police, bureau, at, the, end, of, june, robespierre, occasionally, sought, refuge, in, maisons, alfort, 12, km, 7, 5, mi, outside, of, paris, he, walked, through, the, fields, and, along, the, marne, river, with, his, danish, dog, he, had, four, friends, in, the, revolutionary, government, couthon, and, saint, just, in, the, committee, of, public, safety, and, the, painter, jacques, louis, david, and, joseph, le, bas, in, the, committee, of, general, security, with, whom, he, met, privately, as, they, lived, under, the, same, roof, robespierre, desired, to, maintain, the, committee, of, general, security, s, subordination, to, the, committee, of, public, safety, viewing, them, as, acting, as, two, separate, governments, saint, just, negotiated, concessions, with, bar, re, proposing, more, cooperation, between, committees, on, 22, and, 23, july, he, attended, a, plenary, session, of, the, committees, but, underestimated, his, opponents, strength, feeling, his, grip, on, power, slipping, he, commenced, an, attack, in, the, convention, and, decided, to, make, himself, clear, with, a, new, report, robespierre, was, compared, to, catiline, he, himself, preferred, the, virtues, of, cato, the, younger, on, saturday, 26, july, robespierre, reappeared, at, the, convention, and, delivered, a, two, hour, long, speech, on, the, villainous, factions, he, defended, himself, against, charges, of, dictatorship, and, tyranny, and, then, proceeded, to, warn, of, a, conspiracy, against, the, committee, of, public, safety, collot, questioned, robespierre, s, motives, accusing, him, of, seeking, to, become, a, dictator, when, called, upon, to, name, those, whom, he, accused, robespierre, simply, refused, except, referring, to, joseph, cambon, who, flew, to, the, rostrum, one, man, paralyses, the, will, of, the, national, convention, his, vehemence, changed, the, course, of, the, debate, at, length, lecointre, of, versailles, arose, and, proposed, that, the, speech, should, be, printed, this, motion, was, the, signal, for, agitation, discussion, and, resistance, the, convention, decided, not, to, have, the, text, printed, as, robespierre, s, speech, had, first, to, be, submitted, to, the, two, committees, it, contained, matters, sufficiently, weighty, that, it, needed, to, first, be, examined, robespierre, was, surprised, that, his, speech, would, be, sent, to, the, very, deputies, he, had, intended, to, sue, according, to, saint, just, he, understood, nothing, of, the, reasons, for, his, persecution, he, knew, only, his, misery, a, bitter, debate, ensued, until, bar, re, forced, an, end, to, it, according, to, couthon, not, his, speech, but, the, conspiracy, had, to, be, examined, saint, just, promised, to, prepare, a, report, how, to, break, the, deadlock, in, the, evening, robespierre, delivered, the, same, speech, which, he, regarded, as, his, last, will, at, the, jacobin, club, where, it, was, very, well, received, he, spoke, of, drinking, hemlock, and, jacques, louis, david, cried, out, i, will, drink, it, with, you, collot, d, herbois, and, billaud, varenne, were, driven, out, because, of, their, opposition, to, the, printing, and, distribution, of, the, text, billaud, managed, to, escape, before, he, was, assaulted, but, collot, d, herbois, was, knocked, down, they, set, off, to, the, committee, of, public, safety, where, they, found, saint, just, working, they, asked, him, if, he, was, drawing, up, their, bill, of, indictment, saint, just, promised, to, show, them, his, speech, before, the, session, began, collot, d, herbois, who, chaired, the, convention, decided, not, to, let, him, speak, and, to, make, sure, he, could, not, be, heard, on, the, next, day, gathering, in, secret, nine, members, of, the, two, committees, decided, that, it, was, all, or, nothing, to, protect, themselves, robespierre, had, to, be, arrested, barras, said, they, would, all, die, if, robespierre, did, not, die, the, crucial, factor, that, drove, them, to, make, up, their, minds, to, join, the, conspiracy, seems, in, most, cases, to, have, been, emotional, rather, than, ideological, fear, of, robespierre, s, intentions, towards, them, or, enmity, or, revenge, the, convention, had, lost, 144, delegates, in, 13, months, 67, were, executed, committed, suicide, or, died, in, prison, the, convention, often, insisted, on, deputies, executions, as, the, final, steps, in, a, process, of, political, revival, through, purging, now, extremists, and, indulgents, joined, against, him, laurent, lecointre, was, the, instigator, of, the, coup, he, contacted, robert, lindet, on, the, 6th, and, vadier, on, the, 7th, thermidor, lecointre, was, assisted, by, bar, re, fr, ron, barras, tallien, thuriot, courtois, rov, re, garnier, de, l, aube, and, guffroy, each, one, of, them, prepared, his, part, in, the, attack, they, decided, that, hanriot, his, aides, de, camp, lavalette, and, boulanger, the, public, prosecutor, dumas, the, family, duplay, and, the, printer, charles, l, opold, nicolas, had, to, be, arrested, first, so, robespierre, would, be, without, support, fouch, was, seen, as, the, leader, of, the, conspiracy, but, hid, in, a, garret, at, the, rue, saint, honor, little, is, known, about, his, part, on, the, actual, day, at, noon, saint, just, entered, the, convention, and, prepared, to, place, blame, on, billaud, collot, d, herbois, and, carnot, after, a, few, minutes, tallien, having, a, double, reason, for, desiring, robespierre, s, end, as, on, the, evening, before, robespierre, refused, to, release, theresa, cabarrus, interrupted, him, and, began, the, attack, lebas, attempted, to, speak, in, defence, of, the, triumvirs, robespierre, saint, just, and, couthon, he, was, not, allowed, to, do, so, and, billaud, continued, yesterday, the, president, of, the, revolutionary, tribunal, openly, proposed, to, the, jacobins, that, they, should, drive, all, impure, men, from, the, convention, according, to, tallien, robespierre, wanted, to, attack, us, by, turns, to, isolate, us, and, finally, he, would, be, left, one, day, only, with, the, base, and, abandoned, and, debauched, men, who, serve, him, almost, thirty, five, deputies, spoke, against, robespierre, that, day, most, of, them, from, the, mountain, as, the, accusations, began, to, pile, up, saint, just, remained, silent, robespierre, rushed, toward, the, rostrum, appealed, to, the, plain, to, defend, him, against, the, montagnards, but, his, voice, was, shouted, down, robespierre, rushed, to, the, benches, of, the, left, but, someone, cried, get, away, from, here, condorcet, used, to, sit, here, he, soon, found, himself, at, a, loss, for, words, after, vadier, gave, a, mocking, impression, of, him, referring, to, the, discovery, of, a, letter, under, the, mattress, of, the, illiterate, catherine, th, ot, when, robespierre, very, upset, was, unable, to, speak, garnier, shouted, the, blood, of, danton, chokes, him, robespierre, then, regained, his, voice, is, it, danton, you, regret, cowards, why, didn, t, you, defend, him, at, some, time, louis, louchet, called, for, robespierre, s, arrest, augustin, robespierre, demanded, to, share, his, fate, the, whole, convention, agreed, including, couthon, and, saint, just, le, bas, decided, to, join, saint, just, robespierre, shouted, that, the, revolution, was, lost, when, he, descended, the, tribune, the, five, deputies, were, taken, to, the, committee, of, general, security, and, questioned, not, long, after, hanriot, was, ordered, to, appear, in, the, convention, he, or, someone, else, suggested, to, show, up, only, accompanied, by, a, crowd, on, horseback, hanriot, warned, the, sections, that, there, would, be, an, attempt, to, murder, robespierre, and, mobilised, 2, 400, national, guards, in, front, of, the, town, hall, what, had, happened, was, not, very, clear, to, their, officers, either, the, convention, was, closed, down, or, the, paris, commune, around, six, o, clock, the, city, council, summoned, an, immediate, meeting, to, consider, the, dangers, threatening, the, fatherland, it, gave, orders, to, close, the, gates, and, to, ring, the, tocsin, for, the, convention, that, was, an, illegal, action, without, the, permission, of, the, two, committees, it, was, decreed, that, anyone, leading, an, armed, force, against, the, convention, would, be, regarded, as, an, outlaw, the, city, council, was, in, league, with, the, jacobins, to, bring, off, an, insurrection, asking, them, to, send, over, reinforcements, from, the, galleries, even, the, women, who, are, regulars, there, in, the, early, evening, the, five, deputies, were, taken, in, a, cab, to, different, prisons, robespierre, to, the, palais, du, luxembourg, couthon, to, la, bourbe, and, saint, just, to, the, cossais, augustin, robespierre, was, taken, from, prison, saint, lazare, to, la, force, prison, like, le, bas, who, was, refused, at, the, conciergerie, around, 8, p, m, hanriot, appeared, at, the, place, du, carrousel, in, front, of, the, convention, with, forty, armed, men, on, horses, but, was, taken, prisoner, after, 9, p, m, the, vice, president, of, the, tribunal, coffinhal, went, to, the, committee, of, general, security, with, 3, 000, men, and, their, artillery, as, robespierre, and, his, allies, had, been, taken, to, a, prison, in, the, meantime, he, succeeded, only, in, freeing, hanriot, and, his, adjutants, how, the, five, deputies, escaped, from, prison, was, disputed, according, to, le, moniteur, universel, the, jailers, refused, to, follow, the, order, of, arrest, taken,

disaster, according, to, ernest, hamel, it, is, one, of, the, many, legends, spread, by, bar, re, whatever, the, case, hanriot, landed, in, a, small, courtyard, on, a, heap, of, glass, he, had,

the, executioner, charles, henri, sanson, dislodged, the, bandage, securing, his, shattered, jaw, eliciting, an, anguished, scream, until, his, demise, following, his, beheading, the, crowd, erupted, in, applause, and, jubilant, cries, which, reportedly, endured, for, fifteen, minutes, robespierre, and, his, associates, were, interred, in, a, mass, grave, at, the, newly, established, errancis, cemetery, between, 1844, and, 1859, likely, in, 1848, the, remains, of, all, those, buried, there, were, transferred, to, the, catacombs, of, paris, robespierre, is, best, known, for, his, role, as, a, member, of, the, committee, of, public, safety, he, exerted, his, influence, to, suppress, the, republican, girondins, to, the, right, the, radical, h, bertists, to, the, left, and, the, indulgent, dantonists, in, the, centre, though, nominally, all, members, of, the, committee, were, equally, responsible, the, thermidorians, held, robespierre, as, the, most, culpable, for, the, bloodshed, for, carnot, this, monster, was, above, all, a, hypocrite, it, is, because, he, knew, how, to, seduce, the, people, on, thuriot, s, proposal, the, revolutionary, tribunal, was, suspended, and, replaced, by, a, temporary, commission, on, 1, august, the, law, of, 22, prairial, was, abolished, fouquier, tinville, was, arrested, and, not, long, after, solicitors, were, reintroduced, in, the, courtroom, on, 5, august, the, law, of, suspects, was, disbanded, the, convention, decided, to, release, all, the, prisoners, against, whom, weighed, no, charge, in, mid, august, courtois, was, appointed, by, the, convention, to, collect, evidence, against, robespierre, le, bas, and, saint, just, whose, report, has, a, poor, reputation, selecting, and, destroying, papers, at, the, end, of, the, month, tallien, stated, that, all, that, the, country, had, just, been, through, was, the, terror, and, that, the, monster, robespierre, the, king, of, the, revolution, was, the, orchestrator, according, to, charles, barbaroux, who, visited, him, early, august, 1792, his, pretty, boudoir, was, full, of, images, of, himself, in, every, form, and, art, a, painting, a, drawing, a, bust, a, relief, and, six, physionotraces, on, the, tables, the, eyewitness, helen, maria, williams, attributed, all, the, grim, events, to, his, hypocrisy, and, cunning, she, described, him, as, the, great, conspirator, against, the, liberty, of, france, for, samuel, coleridge, one, of, the, authors, of, the, fall, of, robespierre, he, was, worse, than, oliver, cromwell, for, madame, de, sta, l, robespierre, acquired, the, reputation, of, high, democratic, virtue, and, so, was, believed, to, be, incapable, of, personal, views, as, soon, as, he, was, suspected, of, having, them, his, power, was, at, an, end, vanity, was, robespierre, s, ruling, passion, according, to, sir, walter, scott, in, fact, a, whole, new, political, mythology, was, being, created, on, 23, thermidor, coleridge, started, to, write, the, first, act, of, the, fall, of, robespierre, vilate, who, exaggerated, the, numbers, raged, against, keeping, 300, 000, people, in, prison, and, trying, to, execute, two, or, three, hundred, people, every, day, to, preach, the, ideals, of, 93, after, thermidor, was, to, expose, oneself, to, suspicions, of, robespierrism, suspicions, which, had, to, be, avoided, above, all, others, two, contrasting, legends, around, robespierre, developed, a, critical, one, that, held, robespierre, as, an, irresponsible, self, serving, figure, whose, ambitions, generated, widespread, calamity, and, a, supportive, one, that, held, him, as, an, early, friend, of, the, proletariat, about, to, embark, on, economic, revolution, when, he, fell, robespierre, s, reputation, has, experienced, several, cycles, of, re, appraisal, his, name, peaked, in, the, press, in, the, middle, of, the, 19th, century, between, 1880, and, 1910, and, in, 1940, buchez, a, democratic, mystic, was, producing, volumes, in, which, the, incorruptible, rose, up, as, the, messiah, and, sacrificial, being, of, the, revolution, for, jules, michelet, he, was, the, priest, robespierre, and, for, alphonse, aulard, maximilien, was, a, bigot, monomaniac, and, mystic, assassin, for, mary, duclaux, he, was, the, apostle, of, unity, and, saint, just, a, prophet, robespierre, did, not, thunder, like, danton, or, scream, like, marat, but, his, clear, shrill, voice, enunciated, calmly, syllables, that, the, ears, of, his, listeners, retained, forever, and, it, is, owned, that, in, this, as, in, other, things, robespierre, had, a, strange, provision, of, the, future, as, a, thinker, at, least, as, a, seer, he, made, few, mistakes, his, reputation, peaked, in, the, 1920s, during, the, third, french, republic, when, the, influential, french, historian, albert, mathiez, rejected, the, common, view, of, robespierre, as, demagogic, dictatorial, and, fanatical, mathiez, argued, he, was, an, eloquent, spokesman, for, the, poor, and, oppressed, an, enemy, of, royalist, intrigues, a, vigilant, adversary, of, dishonest, and, corrupt, politicians, a, guardian, of, the, first, french, republic, an, intrepid, leader, of, the, french, revolutionary, government, and, a, prophet, of, a, socially, responsible, state, lenin, referred, to, robespierre, as, a, bolshevik, avant, la, lettre, before, the, term, was, coined, and, erected, the, robespierre, monument, to, him, in, 1918, in, the, soviet, union, he, was, used, as, an, example, of, a, revolutionary, figure, however, the, marxist, approach, that, portrayed, robespierre, as, a, hero, has, largely, faded, away, in, 1941, marc, bloch, a, french, historian, sighed, disillusioned, a, year, before, he, decided, to, join, the, french, resistance, robespierrists, anti, robespierrists, for, pity, s, sake, just, tell, us, who, was, robespierre, according, to, r, r, palmer, the, easiest, way, to, justify, robespierre, is, to, represent, the, other, revolutionists, in, an, unfavourable, or, disgraceful, light, this, was, the, method, used, by, robespierre, himself, soboul, argues, that, robespierre, and, saint, just, were, too, preoccupied, in, defeating, the, interest, of, the, bourgeoisie, to, give, their, total, support, to, the, sans, culottes, and, yet, too, attentive, to, the, needs, of, the, sans, culottes, to, get, support, from, the, middle, class, for, peter, mcphee, robespierre, s, achievements, were, monumental, but, so, was, the, tragedy, of, his, final, weeks, of, indecision, the, members, of, the, committee, together, with, members, of, the, committee, of, general, security, were, as, much, responsible, for, the, running, of, the, terror, as, robespierre, they, may, have, exaggerated, his, role, to, downplay, their, own, contribution, and, used, him, as, a, scapegoat, after, his, death, j, c, martin, and, mcphee, interpret, the, repression, of, the, revolutionary, government, as, a, response, to, anarchy, and, popular, violence, and, not, as, the, assertion, of, a, precise, ideology, martin, holds, tallien, responsible, for, robespierre, s, bad, reputation, and, that, the, thermidorians, invented, the, terror, as, there, is, no, law, that, proves, its, introduction, he, is, a, major, figure, in, the, history, of, france, and, a, controversial, subject, studied, by, the, favorable, jacobin, school, and, the, unfavorable, neo, liberal, school, by, lawyers, and, prosecutors, fran, ois, crouzet, collected, many, interesting, details, from, french, historians, dealing, with, robespierre, in, an, interview, marcel, gauchet, said, that, robespierre, confused, his, private, opinion, and, virtue, the, sale, at, sotheby, s, in, 2011, of, selected, manuscripts, including, speeches, draft, newspaper, articles, drafts, of, reports, to, be, read, at, the, convention, a, fragment, of, the, speech, of, 8, thermidor, and, a, letter, on, virtue, and, happiness, kept, by, the, le, bas, family, after, the, death, of, robespierre, sparked, mobilization, among, historians, and, politicians, pierre, serna, published, an, article, entitled, we, must, save, robespierre, in, le, monde, and, the, society, of, robespierrist, studies, launched, a, call, for, subscriptions, while, the, french, communist, party, the, socialist, party, and, the, radical, party, of, the, left, alerted, the, french, ministry, of, culture, many, historians, neglected, robespierre, s, attitude, towards, the, french, national, guard, from, july, 1789, and, as, public, accuser, responsible, for, the, officers, within, the, police, till, april, 1792, he, then, began, promoting, civilian, armament, and, the, creation, of, a, revolutionary, army, of, 23, 000, men, in, his, periodical, he, defended, the, right, of, revolution, and, promoted, a, revolutionary, armed, force, dubois, cranc, described, robespierre, as, the, general, of, the, sans, culottes, the, revisionist, historian, furet, thought, that, terror, was, inherent, in, the, ideology, of, the, french, revolution, and, was, not, just, a, violent, episode, equally, important, is, his, conclusion, that, revolutionary, violence, is, connected, with, extreme, voluntarism, furet, was, especially, critical, of, the, marxist, line, of, albert, soboul, indeed, he, failed, in, his, opposition, to, two, decisions, which, resulted, in, the, greatest, bloodshed, and, dissension, during, the, revolution, the, declaration, of, war, on, the, european, monarchies, and, the, dechristianization, movement, regarding, the, former, robespierre, feared, that, initiating, a, war, of, liberation, would, consolidate, and, intensify, european, opposition, to, the, revolution, and, risk, a, possible, defeat, he, argued, against, brissot, that, even, if, victorious, the, invading, french, troops, would, be, welcomed, as, liberators, further, he, presciently, argued, that, war, would, create, the, groundwork, for, a, military, dictatorship, as, indeed, it, ultimately, did, regarding, dechristianization, he, saw, it, as, a, gratuitous, affront, to, the, genuine, religious, needs, of, the, people, especially, outside, paris, and, would, only, drive, them, into, the, arms, of, the, refractory, clergy, which, is, exactly, what, happened, with, disastrous, results, in, the, vend, e, historians, in, support, of, robespierre, have, been, at, pains, to, try, to, prove, that, he, was, not, the, dictator, of, france, in, the, year, ii, mcphee, stated, that, on, several, previous, occasions, robespierre, had, admitted, that, he, was, worn, out, his, personal, and, tactical, judgment, once, so, acute, seem, to, have, deserted, him, robespierre, fell, ill, many, times, in, the, spring, of, 1790, in, november, 1792, more, than, three, weeks, in, september, october, 1793, two, weeks, in, february, march, 1794, more, than, a, month, in, april, may, about, three, weeks, and, in, june, july, more, than, three, weeks, these, illnesses, not, only, explain, robespierre, s, repeated, absences, from, committees, and, from, the, convention, during, important, periods, especially, in, 1794, when, the, great, terror, occurred, but, also, the, fact, that, his, faculty, of, judgment, deteriorated, as, did, his, moods, the, assassination, attempts, made, him, suspicious, to, the, point, of, obsession, there, is, a, long, line, of, historians, who, blame, robespierre, for, all, the, less, attractive, episodes, of, the, revolution, robespierre, was, not, part, of, the, celebrations, of, the, bicentenary, of, the, revolution, jonathan, israel, is, sharply, critical, of, robespierre, for, repudiating, the, true, values, of, the, radical, enlightenment, he, argues, jacobin, ideology, and, culture, under, robespierre, was, an, obsessive, rousseauiste, moral, puritanism, steeped, in, authoritarianism, anti, intellectualism, and, xenophobia, and, it, repudiated, free, expression, basic, human, rights, and, democracy, he, refers, to, the, girondin, deputies, thomas, paine, condorcet, daunou, cloots, destutt, and, abb, gregoire, denouncing, robespierre, s, ruthlessness, hypocrisy, dishonesty, lust, for, power, and, intellectual, mediocrity, according, to, jeremy, popkin, he, was, undone, by, his, obsession, with, the, vision, of, an, ideal, republic, zhu, xueqin, became, famous, for, his, 1994, book, titled, the, demise, of, the, republic, of, virtue, from, rousseau, to, robespierre, this, work, has, attracted, countless, readers, and, is, still, being, read, in, china, today, for, aldous, huxley, robespierre, achieved, the, most, superficial, kind, of, revolution, the, political, georges, lefebvre, believed, robespierre, to, be, a, staunch, defender, of, democracy, a, determined, opponent, of, foreign, war, saviour, of, the, republic, and, man, of, integrity, and, vision, robespierre, remains, as, controversial, as, ever, two, centuries, after, his, death, over, 300, actors, have, portrayed, robespierre, in, both, french, and, english, prominent, examples, include
