drawings, and, sketches, from, this, time, have, been, preserved, and, his, characteristic, style, is, evident, in, this, early, work, on, 16, march, 1944, beuys, s, plane, crashed, on, the, crimean, front, close, to, znamianka, then, freiberg, krasnohvardiiske, raion, drawing, from, this, incident, beuys, fashioned, the, myth, that, he, was, rescued, from, the, crash, by, nomadic, tatar, tribesmen, who, wrapped, his, broken, body, in, animal, fat, and, felt, and, nursed, him, back, to, health, had, it, not, been, for, the, tartars, i, would, not, be, alive, today, they, were, the, nomads, of, the, crimea, in, what, was, then, no, man, s, land, between, the, russian, and, german, fronts, and, favoured, neither, side, i, had, already, struck, up, a, good, relationship, with, them, and, often, wandered, off, to, sit, with, them, du, nix, njemcky, they, would, say, du, tartar, and, try, to, persuade, me, to, join, their, clan, their, nomadic, ways, attracted, me, of, course, although, by, that, time, their, movements, had, been, restricted, yet, it, was, they, who, discovered, me, in, the, snow, after, the, crash, when, the, german, search, parties, had, given, up, i, was, still, unconscious, then, and, only, came, round, completely, after, twelve, days, or, so, and, by, then, i, was, back, in, a, german, field, hospital, so, the, memories, i, have, of, that, time, are, images, that, penetrated, my, consciousness, the, last, thing, i, remember, was, that, it, was, too, late, to, jump, too, late, for, the, parachutes, to, open, that, must, have, been, a, couple, of, seconds, before, hitting, the, ground, luckily, i, was, not, strapped, in, i, always, preferred, free, movement, to, safety, belts, my, friend, was, strapped, in, and, he, was, atomized, on, impact, there, was, almost, nothing, to, be, found, of, him, afterwards, but, i, must, have, shot, through, the, windscreen, as, it, flew, back, at, the, same, speed, as, the, plane, hit, the, ground, and, that, saved, me, though, i, had, bad, skull, and, jaw, injuries, then, the, tail, flipped, over, and, i, was, completely, buried, in, the, snow, that, s, how, the, tartars, found, me, days, later, i, remember, voices, saying, voda, water, then, the, felt, of, their, tents, and, the, dense, pungent, smell, of, cheese, fat, and, milk, they, covered, my, body, in, fat, to, help, it, regenerate, warmth, and, wrapped, it, in, felt, as, an, insulator, to, keep, warmth, in, records, state, that, beuys, remained, conscious, was, recovered, by, a, german, search, commando, and, that, there, were, no, tatars, in, the, village, at, the, time, beuys, was, brought, to, a, military, hospital, where, he, stayed, for, three, weeks, from, 17, march, to, 7, april, it, is, consistent, with, beuys, work, that, his, biography, would, have, been, subject, to, his, own, reinterpretation, this, particular, story, has, served, as, a, powerful, origin, myth, for, beuys, s, artistic, identity, and, has, provided, an, initial, interpretive, key, to, his, use, of, unconventional, materials, amongst, which, felt, and, fat, were, central, despite, prior, injuries, he, was, deployed, to, the, western, front, in, august, 1944, assigned, to, a, poorly, equipped, and, trained, paratrooper, unit, he, received, a, gold, wound, badge, for, having, been, wounded, in, action, over, five, times, on, the, day, after, the, german, unconditional, surrender, 8, may, 1945, beuys, was, taken, prisoner, in, cuxhaven, and, brought, to, a, british, internment, camp, from, which, he, was, released, three, months, later, on, 5, august, he, returned, to, his, parents, who, had, moved, to, a, suburb, of, kleve, after, returning, to, kleve, beuys, met, local, sculptor, walter, br, x, and, painter, hanns, lamers, who, encouraged, him, to, take, up, art, as, a, full, time, career, he, joined, the, kleve, artists, association, which, had, been, established, by, br, x, and, lamers, on, 1, april, 1946, beuys, enrolled, in, the, monumental, sculpture, program, at, the, d, sseldorf, academy, of, fine, arts, initially, he, was, assigned, to, the, class, of, joseph, enseling, who, had, a, more, traditional, representational, focus, but, he, managed, to, change, his, mentor, after, three, semesters, joining, the, small, class, of, ewald, matar, in, 1947, who, had, rejoined, the, academy, the, previous, year, after, having, been, banned, by, the, nazis, in, 1939, the, anthroposophical, philosophy, of, rudolf, steiner, became, an, increasingly, important, basis, for, beuys, s, philosophy, in, his, view, it, is, an, approach, that, refers, to, reality, in, a, direct, and, practical, way, and, that, by, comparison, all, forms, of, epistemological, discourse, remain, without, direct, relevance, to, current, trends, and, movements, reaffirming, his, interest, in, science, beuys, re, established, contact, with, heinz, sielmann, and, assisted, with, a, number, of, nature, and, wildlife, documentaries, in, the, region, between, 1947, and, 1949, in, 1947, beuys, along, with, other, artists, including, hann, trier, founded, the, group, donnerstag, gesellschaft, thursday,

shared, a, studio, with, erwin, heerich, that, he, kept, until, 1954, a, year, after, graduation, nobel, laureate, g, nter, grass, recollects, beuys, s, influence, in, matar, s, class, as, shaping, a, christian, anthroposophic, atmosphere, he, read, joyce, impressed, by, the, irish, mythological, elements, in, his, works, the, german, romantics, novalis, and, friedrich, schiller, and, studied, galileo, and, leonardo, whom, he, admired, as, examples, of, artists, and, scientists, who, are, conscious, of, their, position, in, society, and, who, work, accordingly, early, shows, include, participation, in, the, kleve, artists, association, annual, exhibition, in, kleve, s, villa, koekkoek, where, beuys, showed, aquarelles, and, sketches, a, solo, show, at, the, home, of, hans, and, franz, joseph, van, der, grinten, in, kranenburg, as, well, as, a, show, in, the, von, der, heydt, museum, in, wuppertal, beuys, finished, his, education, in, 1953, graduating, at, age, 32, as, master, student, from, matar, s, class, he, had, a, modest, income, from, a, number, of, craft, oriented, commissions, a, gravestone, and, several, pieces, of, furniture, throughout, the, 1950s, beuys, struggled, both, financially, and, from, the, trauma, of, his, wartime, experiences, his, output, consisted, of, drawings, and, sculptural, work, beuys, explored, a, range, of, unconventional, materials, and, developed, his, artistic, agenda, exploring, metaphorical, and, symbolic, connections, between, natural, phenomena, and, philosophical, systems, often, difficult, to, interpret, in, themselves, his, drawings, constitute, a, speculative, contingent, and, hermetic, exploration, of, the, material, world, myth, and, philosophy, in, 1974, 327, drawings, the, majority, of, which, were, made, during, the, late, 1940s, and, 1950s, were, collected, into, a, group, entitled, the, secret, block, for, a, secret, person, in, ireland, a, reference, to, joyce, and, exhibited, in, oxford, edinburgh, dublin, and, belfast, in, 1956, artistic, self, doubt, and, material, impoverishment, led, to, a, physical, and, psychological, crisis, and, beuys, entered, a, period, of, serious, depression, he, recovered, at, the, house, of, his, most, important, early, patrons, the, van, der, grinten, brothers, in, kranenburg, in, 1958, beuys, participated, in, an, international, competition, for, an, auschwitz, birkenau, memorial, his, proposal, did, not, win, and, his, design, was, never, realised, in, 1958, beuys, began, a, cycle, of, drawings, related, to, joyce, s, ulysses, completed, in, around, 1961, the, six, exercise, books, of, drawings, would, constitute, beuys, declared, an, extension, of, joyce, s, seminal, novel, in, 1959, beuys, married, eva, wurmbach, they, had, two, children, wenzel, born, 1961, and, jessyka, born, 1964, in, 1961, beuys, was, appointed, professor, of, monumental, sculpture, at, the, kunstakademie, d, sseldorf, his, students, were, artists, anatol, herzfeld, katharina, sieverding, j, rg, immendorff, blinky, palermo, peter, angermann, walter, dahn, johannes, st, ttgen, sigmar, polke, and, friederike, weske, his, youngest, student, was, elias, maria, reti, who, began, to, study, art, in, his, class, at, the, age, of, 15, beuys, entered, wider, public, consciousness, in, 1964, when, he, participated, in, a, festival, at, the, technical, college, aachen, which, coincided, with, the, 20th, anniversary, of, an, assassination, attempt, on, adolf, hitler, beuys, created, a, performance, or, action, aktion, which, was, interrupted, by, a, group, of, students, one, of, whom, attacked, beuys, punching, him, in, the, face, a, photograph, of, the, artist, nose, bloodied, and, arm, raised, was, circulated, in, the, media, it, was, for, this, 1964, festival, that, beuys, produced, an, idiosyncratic, cv, which, he, titled, lebenslauf, werklauf, life, course, work, course, the, document, was, a, self, consciously, fictionalised, account, of, the, artist, s, life, in, which, historical, events, mingle, with, metaphorical, and, mythical, speech, he, refers, to, his, birth, as, the, exhibition, of, a, wound, he, claims, his, ulysses, extension, to, have, been, carried, out, at, james, joyce, s, request, impossible, given, that, the, writer, was, long, dead, by, 1961, this, document, marks, a, blurring, of, fact, and, fiction, that, was, to, be, characteristic, of, beuys, self, created, persona, beuys, manifested, his, social, philosophical, ideas, in, abolishing, entry, requirements, to, his, d, sseldorf, class, throughout, the, late, 1960s, this, renegade, policy, caused, great, institutional, friction, coming, to, a, head, in, october, 1972, when, beuys, was, dismissed, from, his, post, that, year, he, found, 142, applicants, who, had, not, been, accepted, whom, he, wished, to, enroll, under, his, teaching, beuys, and, 16, students, subsequently, occupied, the, offices, of, the, academy, to, force, a, hearing, regarding, their, admission, they, were, admitted, by, the, school, but, the, relationship, between, beuys, and, the, school, was, irreconcilable, he, again, occupied, the, university, offices, with, a, group, of, students, the, police, were, called, and, he, was, escorted, laughing, from, the, building, this, was, depicted, in, a, photograph, which, was, used, to, create, a, 1973, silkscreen, print, with, the, title, democracy, is, funny, shortly, after, he, was, dismissed, from, his, post, the, dismissal, which, beuys, refused, to, accept, produced, a, wave, of, protests, from, students, artists, and, critics, although, now, without, an, institutional, position, beuys, continued, an, intense, schedule, of, public, lectures, and, discussions, and, became, increasingly, active, in, german, politics, despite, this, dismissal, the, walkway, on, the, academy, s, side, of, the, rhine, is, named, for, beuys, later, in, life, beuys, became, a, visiting, professor, at, various, institutions, 1980, 1985, the, most, important, discussion, is, epistemological, in, character, stated, beuys, demonstrating, his, desire, for, continuous, intellectual, exchange, beuys, attempted, to, apply, philosophical, concepts, to, his, pedagogical, practice, beuys, s, action, how, to, explain, pictures, to, a, dead, hare, exemplifies, a, performance, that, is, especially, relevant, to, the, pedagogical, field, because, it, addresses, the, difficulty, of, explaining, things, the, artist, spent, three, hours, explaining, his, art, to, a, dead, hare, with, his, head, covered, with, honey, and, gold, leaf, and, ulmer, argues, not, only, that, the, honey, on, the, head, but, the, hare, itself, are, models, of, thinking, of, man, embodying, his, ideas, in, forms, contemporary, movements, such, as, performance, art, may, be, considered, laboratories, for, a, new, pedagogy, since, research, and, experiment, have, replaced, form, as, the, guiding, force, during, an, artforum, interview, with, willoughby, sharp, in, 1969, beuys, added, to, his, famous, statement, teaching, is, my, greatest, work, of, art, that, the, rest, is, the, waste, product, a, demonstration, if, you, want, to, express, yourself, you, must, present, something, tangible, but, after, a, while, this, has, only, the, function, of, a, historic, document, objects, aren, t, very, important, any, more, i, want, to, get, to, the, origin, of, matter, to, the, thought, behind, it, beuys, saw, his, role, of, an, artist, as, a, teacher, or, shaman, who, could, guide, society, in, a, new, direction, at, the, d, sseldorf, academy, of, art, beuys, did, not, impose, his, artistic, style, or, techniques, on, his, students, in, fact, he, kept, much, of, his, work, and, exhibitions, hidden, from, the, classroom, because, he, wanted, his, students, to, explore, their, own, interests, ideas, and, talents, beuys, s, actions, were, somewhat, contradictory, while, he, was, extremely, strict, about, certain, aspects, of, classroom, management, and, instruction, such, as, punctuality, and, the, need, for, students, to, take, draftsmanship, classes, he, encouraged, his, students, to, freely, set, their, own, artistic, goals, without, having, to, prescribe, to, set, curricula, another, aspect, of, beuys, s, pedagogy, included, open, ring, discussions, or, ringgesprache, where, beuys, and, his, students, discussed, political, and, philosophical, issues, of, the, day, including, the, role, of, art, democracy, and, the, university, in, society, some, of, his, ideas, espoused, in, class, discussion, and, in, his, art, making, included, free, art, education, for, all, the, discovery, of, creativity, in, everyday, life, and, the, belief, that, everyone, an, artist, beuys, himself, encouraged, peripheral, activity, and, all, manner, of, expression, to, emerge, during, the, course, of, these, discussions, while, some, of, beuys, s, students, enjoyed, the, open, discourse, of, the, ringgesprache, others, including, palermo, and, immendorf, disapproved, of, the, classroom, disorder, and, anarchic, characteristics, eventually, rejecting, his, methods, and, philosophies, altogether, beuys, also, advocated, taking, art, outside, of, the, boundaries, of, the, art, system, and, opening, it, up, to, multiple, possibilities, bringing, creativity, into, all, areas, of, life, his, nontraditional, and, anti, establishment, pedagogical, practice, and, philosophy, made, him, the, focus, of, much, controversy, and, to, battle, the, policy, of, restricted, entry, under, which, only, a, few, select, students, were, allowed, to, attend, art, classes, he, deliberately, allowed, students, to, over, enroll, in, his, courses, anastasia, shartin, true, to, his, belief, those, who, have, something, to, teach, and, those, who, have, something, to, learn, should, come, together, according, to, cornelia, lauf, 1992, in, order, to, implement, his, idea, as, well, as, a, host, of, supporting, notions, encompassing, cultural, and, political, concepts, beuys, crafted, a, charismatic, artistic, persona, that, infused, his, work, with, mystical, overtones, and, led, him, to, be, called, shaman, and, messianic, in, the, popular, press, beuys, had, adopted, shamanism, not, only, as, a, presentation, mode, of, his, art, but, also, in, his, own, life, although, the, artist, as, a, shaman, has, been, a, trend, in, modern, art, picasso, gauguin, beuys, is, unusual, in, that, respect, as, he, integrated, his, art, and, his, life, into, the, shaman, role, beuys, believed, that, humanity, with, its, turn, on, rationality, was, trying, to, eliminate, emotions, and, thus, eliminate, a, major, source, of, energy, and, creativity, in, his, first, lecture, tour, in, america, he, espoused, that, humanity, was, in, an, evolving, state, and, that, as, spiritual, beings, we, ought, to, draw, on, both, our, emotions, and, our, thinking, as, they, represent, the, total, energy, and, creativity, for, every, individual, beuys, described, how, we, must, seek, out, and, energize, our, spirituality, and, link, it, to, our, thinking, powers, so, that, our, vision, of, the, world, must, be, extended, to, encompass, all, the, invisible, energies, with, which, we, have, lost, contact, beuys, saw, his, performance, art, as, shamanistic, and, psychoanalytic, to, both, educate, and, heal, the, general, public, it, was, thus, a, strategic, stage, to, use, the, shaman, s, character, but, subsequently, i, gave, scientific, lectures, also, at, times, on, one, hand, i, was, a, kind, of, modern, scientific, analyst, on, the, other, hand, in, the, actions, i, had, a, synthetic, existence, as, shaman, this, strategy, aimed, at, creating, in, people, an, agitation, for, instigating, questions, rather, than, for, conveying, a, complete, and, perfect, structure, it, was, a, kind, of, psychoanalysis, with, all, the, problems, of, energy, and, culture, beuys, s, art, was, considered, both, instructive, and, therapeutic, his, intention, was, to, use, these, two, forms, of, discourse, and, styles, of, knowledge, as, pedagogues, he, used, shamanistic, and, psychoanalytic, techniques, to, manipulate, symbols, and, affect, his, audience, in, his, personal, life, beuys, had, adopted, a, felt, hat, a, felt, suit, a, cane, and, a, vest, as, his, standard, look, the, imagined, story, of, him, being, rescued, by, tartar, herdsmen, perhaps, is, an, explanation, for, his, adopting, materials, like, felt, and, fat, beuys, experienced, severe, depression, between, 1955, and, 1957, after, recovering, he, observed, at, the, time, that, his, personal, crisis, caused, him, to, question, everything, in, life, and, he, called, the, incident, a, shamanistic, initiation, he, saw, death, not, only, in, its, inevitability, for, people, but, also, death, in, the, environment, and, through, his, art, and, his, political, activism, he, became, a, strong, critic, of, environmental, destruction, he, said, at, the, time, i, don, t, use, shamanism, to, refer, to, death, but, vice, versa, through, shamanism, i, refer, to, the, fatal, character, of, the, times, we, live, in, but, at, the, same, time, i, also, point, out, that, the, fatal, character, of, the, present, can, be, overcome, in, the, future, the, only, major, retrospective, of, beuys, work, to, be, organised, in, beuys, s, lifetime, opened, at, the, guggenheim, museum, in, new, york, in, 1979, the, exhibition, has, been, described, as, a, lightning, rod, for, american, criticism, eliciting, as, it, did, some, powerful, and, polemical, responses, beuys, died, of, heart, failure, on, 23, january, 1986, in, d, sseldorf, beuys, s, extensive, body, of, work, principally, comprises, four, domains, works, of, art, in, a, traditional, sense, painting, drawing, sculpture, and, installations, performance, contributions, to, the, theory, of, art, and, academic, teaching, and, social, and, political, activities, in, 1962, beuys, befriended, his, d, sseldorf, colleague, nam, june, paik, a, member, of, the, fluxus, movement, this, began, what, was, to, be, a, brief, formal, involvement, with, fluxus, a, loose, international, group, of, artists, who, championed, radical, erosion, of, artistic, boundaries, bringing, aspects, of, creative, practice, outside, of, the, institution, and, into, the, everyday, although, beuys, participated, in, a, number, of, fluxus, events, it, soon, became, clear, that, he, viewed, the, implications, of, art, s, economic, and, institutional, framework, differently, indeed, whereas, fluxus, was, directly, inspired, by, the, radical, dada, activities, emerging, during, the, first, world, war, beuys, in, a, 1964, broadcast, from, the, second, german, television, studio, a, different, message, das, schweigen, von, marcel, duchamp, wird, berbewertet, the, silence, of, marcel, duchamp, is, overrated, beuys, s, relationship, with, the, legacy, of, duchamp, and, the, readymade, is, a, central, if, often, unacknowledged, aspect, of, the, controversy, surrounding, his, practice, on, 12, january, 1985, beuys, together, with, andy, warhol, and, kaii, higashiyama, became, involved, in, the, global, art, fusion, project, this, was, a, fax, art, project, initiated, by, the, conceptual, artist, ueli, fuchser, in, which, faxes, with, drawings, of, all, three, artists, were, sent, within, 32, minutes, around, the, world, from, d, sseldorf, germany, via, new, york, usa, to, tokyo, japan, and, received, at, vienna, s, palais, liechtenstein, museum, of, modern, art, this, fax, event, was, a, sign, of, peace, during, the, cold, war, in, the, 1980s, beuys, s, first, solo, exhibition, in, a, private, gallery, opened, on, 26, november, 1965, with, one, of, his, most, famous, performances, how, to, explain, pictures, to, a, dead, hare, the, artist, could, be, viewed, through, the, glass, of, the, gallery, s, window, his, face, was, covered, in, honey, and, gold, leaf, and, an, iron, slab, was, attached, to, his, boot, in, his, arms, he, cradled, a, dead, hare, into, whose, ear, he, uttered, muffled, noises, as, well, as, explanations, of, the, drawings, lining, the, walls, such, materials, and, actions, had, specific, symbolic, value, for, beuys, for, example, honey, is, the, product, of, bees, and, for, beuys, following, rudolf, steiner, bees, represented, an, ideal, society, of, warmth, and, brotherhood, gold, had, its, importance, within, alchemical, enquiry, and, iron, the, metal, of, mars, stood, for, a, masculine, principle, of, strength, and, connection, to, the, earth, a, photograph, from, the, performance, in, which, beuys, sits, with, the, hare, has, been, described, by, some, critics, as, a, new, mona, lisa, of, the, 20th, century, though, beuys, disagreed, with, the, description, beuys, explained, his, performance, this, way, in, putting, honey, on, my, head, i, am, clearly, doing, something, that, has, to, do, with, thinking, human, ability, is, not, to, produce, honey, but, to, think, to, produce, ideas, in, this, way, the, deathlike, character, of, thinking, becomes, lifelike, again, for, honey, is, undoubtedly, a, living, substance, human, thinking, can, be, lively, too, but, it, can, also, be, intellectualized, to, a, deadly, degree, and, remain, dead, and, express, its, deadliness, in, say, the, political, or, pedagogic, fields, gold, and, honey, indicate, a, transformation, of, the, head, and, therefore, naturally, and, logically, the, brain, and, our, understanding, of, thought, consciousness, and, all, the, other, levels, necessary, to, explain, pictures, to, a, hare, the, warm, stool, insulated, with, felt, and, the, iron, sole, with, the, magnet, i, had, to, walk, on, this, sole, when, i, carried, the, hare, round, from, picture, to, picture, so, along, with, the, strange, limp, came, the, clank, of, iron, on, the, hard, stone, floor, that, was, all, that, broke, the, silence, since, my, explanations, were, mute, this, seems, to, have, been, the, action, that, most, captured, people, s, imaginations, on, one, level, this, must, be, because, everyone, consciously, or, unconsciously, recognizes, the, problem, of, explaining, things, particularly, where, art, and, creative, work, are, concerned, or, anything, that, involves, a, certain, mystery, or, question, the, idea, of, explaining, to, an, animal, conveys, a, sense, of, the, secrecy, of, the, world, and, of, existence, that, appeals, to, the, imagination, then, as, i, said, even, a, dead, animal, preserves, more, powers, of, intuition, than, some, human, beings, with, their, stubborn, rationality, the, problem, lies, in, the, word, understanding, and, its, many, levels, which, cannot, be, restricted, to, rational, analysis, imagination, inspiration, and, longing, all, lead, people, to, sense, that, these, other, levels, also, play, a, part, in, understanding, this, must, be, the, root, of, reactions, to, this, action, and, is, why, my, technique, has, been, to, try, and, seek, out, the, energy, points, in, the, human, power, field, rather, than, demanding, specific, knowledge, or, reactions, on, the, part, of, the, public, i, try, to, bring, to, light, the, complexity, of, creative, areas, beuys, produced, many, such, spectacular, ritualistic, performances, and, he, developed, a, compelling, persona, whereby, he, took, on, a, liminal, shamanistic, role, as, if, to, enable, passage, between, different, physical, and, spiritual, states, further, examples, of, such, performances, include, eurasienstab, 1967, celtic, kinloch, rannoch, scottish, symphony, 1970, and, i, like, america, and, america, likes, me, 1974, the, chief, was, first, performed, in, copenhagen, in, 1963, and, in, berlin, in, 1964, beuys, positioned, himself, on, the, gallery, floor, wrapped, entirely, in, a, large, felt, blanket, and, remained, there, for, nine, hours, emerging, from, either, end, of, the, blanket, were, two, dead, hares, around, him, was, an, installation, of, copper, rod, felt, fat, hair, and, fingernails, inside, the, blanket, beuys, held, a, microphone, into, which, he, breathed, coughed, groaned, grumbled, whispered, and, whistled, at, irregular, intervals, with, the, results, amplified, by, a, pa, system, as, viewers, observed, from, the, doorway, in, her, book, on, beuys, caroline, tisdall, wrote, that, the, chief, is, the, first, performance, in, which, the, rich, vocabulary, of, the, next, fifteen, years, is, already, suggested, and, that, its, theme, is, the, exploration, of, levels, of, communication, beyond, human, semantics, by, appealing, to, atavistic, and, instinctual, powers, beuys, stated, that, his, presence, in, the, room, was, like, that, of, a, carrier, wave, attempting, to, switch, off, my, own, species, range, of, semantics, he, also, said, for, me, the, chief, was, above, all, an, important, sound, piece, the, most, recurring, sound, was, deep, in, the, throat, and, hoarse, like, the, cry, of, the, stag, this, is, a, primary, sound, reaching, far, back, the, sounds, i, make, are, taken, consciously, from, animals, i, see, it, as, a, way, of, coming, into, contact, with, other, forms, of, existence, beyond, the, human, one, it, s, a, way, of, going, beyond, our, restricted, understanding, to, expand, the, scale, of, producers, of, energy, among, co, operators, in, other, species, all, of, whom, have, different, abilities, beuys, also, acknowledged, the, physical, demands, of, the, performance, it, takes, a, lot, of, discipline, to, avoid, panicking, in, such, a, condition, floating, empty, and, devoid, of, emotion, and, without, specific, feelings, of, claustrophobia, or, pain, for, nine, hours, in, the, same, position, such, an, action, changes, me, radically, in, a, way, it, s, a, death, a, real, action, and, not, an, interpretation, writer, jan, verwoert, noted, that, beuys, voice, filled, the, room, while, the, source, was, nowhere, to, be, found, the, artist, was, the, focus, of, attention, yet, remained, invisible, rolled, up, in, a, felt, blanket, throughout, the, duration, of, the, event, visitors, were, forced, to, stay, in, the, neighboring, room, they, could, see, what, was, happening, but, remained, barred, from, direct, physical, access, to, the, event, the, partial, closing, off, of, the, performance, space, from, the, audience, space, created, distance, and, at, the, same, time, increased, the, attraction, of, the, artist, s, presence, he, was, present, acoustically, and, physically, as, part, of, a, piece, of, sculpture, but, also, absent, invisible, untouchable, verwoert, suggests, that, the, chief, can, be, read, as, a, parable, of, cultural, work, in, a, public, medium, the, authority, of, those, who, dare, or, are, so, bold, as, to, speak, publicly, results, from, the, fact, that, they, isolate, themselves, from, the, gaze, of, the, public, under, the, gaze, of, the, public, in, order, to, still, address, it, in, indirect, speech, relayed, through, a, medium, what, is, constituted, in, this, ceremony, is, authority, in, the, sense, of, authorship, in, the, sense, of, a, public, voice, beuys, stages, the, creation, of, such, a, public, voice, as, an, event, that, is, as, dramatic, as, it, is, absurd, he, thus, asserts, the, emergence, of, such, a, voice, as, an, event, at, the, same, time, however, he, also, undermines, this, assertion, through, the, lamentably, powerless, form, by, which, this, voice, is, produced, in, emitting, half, smothered, inarticulate, sounds, that, would, have, remained, inaudible, without, electronic, amplification, lana, shafer, meador, wrote, inherent, to, the, chief, were, issues, of, communication, and, transformation, for, beuys, his, own, muffled, coughs, breaths, and, grunts, were, his, way, of, speaking, for, the, hares, giving, a, voice, to, those, who, are, misunderstood, or, do, not, possess, their, own, in, the, midst, of, this, metaphysical, communication, and, transmission, the, audience, was, left, out, in, the, cold, beuys, deliberately, distanced, the, viewers, by, physically, positioning, them, in, a, separate, gallery, room, only, able, to, hear, but, not, see, what, is, occurring, and, by, performing, the, action, for, a, grueling, nine, hours, beuys, performed, infiltration, homogen, for, piano, in, d, sseldorf, in, 1966, the, result, was, a, piano, covered, entirely, in, felt, with, two, crosses, made, of, red, material, affixed, to, its, sides, beuys, wrote, the, sound, of, the, piano, is, trapped, inside, the, felt, skin, in, the, normal, sense, a, piano, is, an, instrument, used, to, produce, sound, when, not, in, use, it, is, silent, but, still, has, a, sound, potential, here, no, sound, is, possible, and, the, piano, is, condemned, to, silence, he, also, said, the, relationship, to, the, human, position, is, marked, by, the, two, red, crosses, signifying, emergency, the, danger, that, threatens, if, we, stay, silent, and, fail, to, make, the, next, evolutionary, step, such, an, object, is, intended, as, a, stimulus, for, discussion, and, in, no, way, is, to, be, taken, as, an, aesthetic, product, during, the, performance, he, also, used, wax, earplugs, and, drew, and, wrote, on, a, blackboard, the, piece, is, subtitled, the, greatest, composer, here, is, the, thalidomide, child, and, attempts, to, bring, attention, to, the, plight, of, children, affected, by, the, drug, thalidomide, was, a, sleep, aid, introduced, in, the, 1950s, in, germany, it, was, promoted, to, help, relieve, the, symptoms, of, morning, sickness, and, was, prescribed, in, unlimited, doses, to, pregnant, women, however, it, quickly, became, apparent, that, thalidomide, caused, death, and, deformities, in, some, children, of, mothers, who, had, taken, the, drug, it, was, on, the, market, for, less, than, four, years, in, germany, around, 2, 500, children, were, affected, during, his, performance, beuys, held, a, discussion, about, the, tragedy, surrounding, thalidomide, children, beuys, also, prepared, infiltration, homogens, for, cello, a, cello, wrapped, in, grey, felt, with, a, red, cross, attached, for, musician, charlotte, moorman, who, performed, it, in, conjunction, with, nam, june, paik, caroline, tisdall, noted, how, in, this, work, sound, and, silence, exterior, and, interior, are, brought, together, in, objects, and, actions, as, representatives, of, the, physical, and, spiritual, worlds, australian, sculptor, ken, unsworth, wrote, that, infiltration, became, a, black, hole, instead, of, sound, escaping, sound, was, drawn, into, it, it, wasn, t, as, if, the, piano, was, dead, i, realised, beuys, identified, felt, with, saving, and, preserving, life, artist, dan, mclaughlin, wrote, of, the, quiet, absorptive, silencing, of, an, instrument, capable, of, an, infinity, of, expressions, the, power, and, potency, of, the, instrument, is, dressed, swaddled, even, in, felt, legs, and, all, and, creates, a, clumsy, pachyderm, like, metaphor, for, a, kind, of, silent, entombment, but, it, is, also, a, power, incubated, protected, and, storing, potential, expressions, pieces, like, infiltration, showcase, the, intuitive, power, beuys, had, understanding, that, some, materials, had, invested, in, them, human, language, and, human, gesture, through, use, and, proximity, through, morphological, sympathy, art, historian, uwe, schneede, considers, this, performance, pivotal, for, the, reception, of, german, avant, garde, art, in, the, united, states, since, it, paved, the, way, for, recognition, of, not, only, beuys, own, work, but, also, that, of, contemporaries, such, as, georg, baselitz, kiefer, l, pertz, and, many, others, in, the, 1980s, in, may, 1974, beuys, flew, to, new, york, and, was, taken, by, ambulance, to, the, site, of, the, performance, a, room, in, the, ren, block, gallery, at, 409, west, broadway, beuys, lay, on, the, ambulance, stretcher, swathed, in, felt, he, shared, this, room, with, a, coyote, for, eight, hours, over, three, days, at, times, he, stood, wrapped, in, a, thick, grey, blanket, of, felt, leaning, on, a, large, shepherd, s, staff, at, times, he, lay, on, the, straw, at, times, he, watched, the, coyote, as, the, coyote, watched, him, and, cautiously, circled, the, man, or, shredded, the, blanket, to, pieces, and, at, times, he, engaged, in, symbolic, gestures, such, as, striking, a, large, triangle, or, tossing, his, leather, gloves, to, the, animal, the, performance, continuously, shifted, between, elements, that, were, required, by, the, realities, of, the, situation, and, elements, that, had, a, purely, symbolic, character, at, the, end, of, the, three, days, beuys, hugged, the, coyote, that, had, grown, quite, tolerant, of, him, and, was, taken, to, the, airport, again, he, rode, in, a, veiled, ambulance, leaving, america, without, having, set, foot, on, its, ground, as, beuys, later, explained, i, wanted, to, isolate, myself, insulate, myself, see, nothing, of, america, other, than, the, coyote, in, 2013, dale, eisinger, of, complex, ranked, i, like, america, and, america, likes, me, the, second, greatest, work, of, performance, art, ever, after, pandrogeny, by, genesis, p, orridge, richard, demarco, invited, beuys, to, scotland, in, may, 1970, and, again, in, august, to, show, and, perform, in, the, edinburgh, international, festival, with, g, nther, uecker, blinky, palermo, and, other, d, sseldorf, artists, plus, robert, filliou, where, they, took, over, the, main, spaces, of, the, edinburgh, college, of, art, the, exhibition, was, a, defining, moment, for, british, and, european, art, directly, influencing, several, generations, of, artists, and, curators, in, edinburgh, in, 1970, beuys, created, arena, for, demarco, as, a, retrospective, of, his, art, up, to, that, time, showed, his, installation, the, pack, beuys, and, performed, celtic, kinloch, rannoch, with, henning, christiansen, and, johannes, stuttgen, in, support, seen, by, several, thousands, this, was, beuys, first, use, of, blackboards, and, the, beginning, of, nine, trips, to, scotland, to, work, with, richard, demarco, and, six, to, ireland, and, five, to, england, working, mainly, with, art, critic, caroline, tisdall, and, troubled, image, group, artist, robert, mcdowell, and, others, in, the, detailed, formulation, of, the, free, international, university, for, creativity, and, interdisciplinary, research, fiu, presented, at, documenta, 6, in, 1977, in, london, in, 1978, and, edinburgh, in, 1980, as, well, as, in, many, other, iterations, in, edinburgh, at, the, end, of, the, 1970s, the, fiu, became, among, four, organisations, that, founded, the, german, green, party, beuys, became, entranced, by, the, periphery, of, europe, as, a, dynamic, counter, in, cultural, and, economic, terms, to, europe, s, centralisation, and, this, included, linking, europe, s, energies, north, south, to, italy, and, east, west, in, the, eurasia, concept, with, special, emphasis, on, celtic, traditions, in, landscape, poetry, and, myths, that, also, define, eurasia, in, his, view, anything, that, survives, as, art, and, ideas, and, beliefs, including, the, great, religions, for, centuries, or, millennia, contain, eternal, truths, and, beauty, the, truth, of, ideas, and, of, thinking, as, form, the, sculpture, of, energies, across, a, wide, and, variegated, spectrum, from, mythos, and, spirituality, to, materialism, socialism, and, capitalism, and, of, creativity, capital, encompassed, for, him, the, study, of, geology, botany, and, animal, life, finding, meanings, and, precepts, in, all, of, these, as, much, as, in, the, study, of, society, philosophy, and, the, human, condition, and, in, his, art, practice, as, social, sculpture, he, adopted, and, developed, a, gestalt, way, to, examine, and, work, with, both, organic, and, inorganic, substances, and, human, social, elements, following, leonardo, loyola, goethe, steiner, joyce, and, many, other, artists, scientists, and, thinkers, working, with, all, visible, and, invisible, aspects, comprising, a, totality, of, cultural, moral, and, ethical, significance, as, much, as, practical, or, scientific, value, these, trips, inspired, many, works, and, performances, beuys, considered, edinburgh, with, its, enlightenment, history, as, a, laboratory, of, inspirational, ideas, when, visiting, loch, awe, and, rannoch, moor, on, his, may, 1970, visit, to, demarco, he, first, conceived, the, necessity, of, the, 7, 000, oaks, work, after, making, the, loch, awe, sculpture, at, rannoch, moor, he, began, what, became, the, celtic, kinlock, rannoch, scottish, symphony, performance, developed, further, in, basel, the, next, year, as, celtic, the, performance, in, edinburgh, included, his, first, blackboard, that, later, appeared, in, many, performances, when, in, discussion, with, the, public, with, it, and, his, eurasian, staff, he, is, a, transmitter, and, despite, long, periods, of, imperturbable, stillness, interspersed, by, christiansen, s, sound, sculptures, he, also, creates, dialogue, evoking, artists, thoughts, and, in, discussion, with, spectators, he, collected, gelatin, representing, crystalline, stored, energy, of, ideas, that, had, been, spread, over, the, wall, in, basel, the, action, including, washing, the, feet, of, seven, spectators, he, immersed, himself, in, water, with, reference, to, christian, traditions, and, baptism, and, symbolized, revolutionary, freedom, from, false, preconceptions, he, then, as, in, edinburgh, pushed, a, blackboard, across, the, floor, alternately, writing, or, drawing, on, it, for, his, audience, he, put, each, piece, in, a, tray, and, as, the, tray, became, full, he, held, it, above, his, head, and, convulsed, causing, the, gelatin, to, fall, on, him, and, the, floor, he, followed, this, with, a, quiet, pause, he, stared, into, emptiness, for, over, half, an, hour, fairly, still, in, both, performances, during, this, time, he, had, a, lance, in, his, hand, and, was, standing, by, the, blackboard, where, he, had, drawn, a, grail, he, took, a, protective, stance, after, this, he, repeated, each, action, in, the, opposite, order, ending, with, the, washing, with, water, as, a, final, cleansing, the, performances, were, filled, with, celtic, symbolism, with, various, interpretations, or, historic, influences, this, extended, in, 1972, with, the, performance, vitex, agnus, castus, in, naples, of, combining, female, and, male, elements, and, evoking, much, else, and, extended, further, with, i, like, america, and, america, likes, me, to, have, a, performance, dialogue, with, the, original, energy, of, america, represented, by, the, endangered, yet, highly, intelligent, coyote, in, 1974, in, edinburgh, beuys, worked, with, buckminster, fuller, in, demarco, s, black, white, oil, conference, where, beuys, talked, of, the, energy, plan, of, the, western, man, using, blackboards, in, open, discussion, with, audiences, at, demarco, s, forrest, hill, schoolhouse, in, the, 1974, edinburgh, festival, beuys, performed, three, pots, for, the, poorhouse, again, using, gelatin, in, edinburgh, s, ancient, poorhouse, continuing, the, development, begun, with, celtic, kinloch, rannoch, he, met, there, tadeusz, kantor, directing, lovelies, and, dowdies, and, was, at, marina, abramovi, s, first, ever, performance, in, 1976, beuys, performed, in, defence, of, the, innocent, at, the, demarco, gallery, where, he, stood, for, the, imprisoned, gangster, and, sculptor, jimmy, boyle, in, a, manner, associating, boyle, with, the, coyote, in, 1980, edinburgh, festival, beuys, was, at, the, fiu, exhibition, and, performed, jimmy, boyle, days, the, name, of, the, blackboards, he, used, in, public, discussions, and, where, he, went, on, a, hunger, strike, as, a, public, protest, and, led, with, others, in, a, legal, action, against, the, scottish, justice, system, this, was, the, first, case, under, the, new, european, human, rights, act, the, eight, performances, should, be, understood, as, one, continuum, during, the, 1960s, beuys, formed, his, central, theoretical, concepts, about, arts, social, cultural, and, political, function, and, potential, indebted, to, romantic, writers, like, novalis, and, schiller, beuys, was, motivated, by, a, belief, in, the, power, of, universal, human, creativity, and, was, confident, about, the, potential, for, art, to, bring, about, revolutionary, change, these, ideas, were, founded, in, the, body, of, social, ideas, of, rudolf, steiner, known, as, social, threefolding, of, which, he, was, a, vigorous, and, original, proponent, this, translated, into, beuys, s, devising, the, concept, of, social, sculpture, in, which, society, as, a, whole, was, to, be, regarded, as, one, great, work, of, art, the, wagnerian, gesamtkunstwerk, to, which, each, person, can, contribute, creatively, perhaps, beuys, s, most, famous, phrase, borrowed, from, novalis, is, everyone, is, an, artist, in, the, video, willoughby, sharp, joseph, beuys, public, dialogues, 1974, 120, min, a, record, of, beuys, s, first, major, public, discussion, in, the, u, s, beuys, elaborates, three, principles, freedom, democracy, and, socialism, saying, that, each, of, them, depends, on, the, other, two, in, order, to, be, meaningful, in, 1973, beuys, wrote, only, on, condition, of, a, radical, widening, of, definitions, will, it, be, possible, for, art, and, activities, related, to, art, provide, evidence, that, art, is, now, the, only, evolutionary, revolutionary, power, only, art, is, capable, of, dismantling, the, repressive, effects, of, a, senile, social, system, that, continues, to, totter, along, the, deathline, to, dismantle, in, order, to, build, a, social, organism, as, a, work, of, art, every, human, being, is, an, artist, who, from, his, state, of, freedom, the, position, of, freedom, that, he, experiences, at, first, hand, learns, to, determine, the, other, positions, of, the, total, art, work, of, the, future, social, order, in, 1982, he, was, invited, to, create, a, work, for, documenta, 7, he, delivered, a, large, pile, of, basalt, stones, from, above, one, could, see, that, the, pile, of, stones, was, a, large, arrow, pointing, to, a, single, oak, tree, that, he, had, planted, he, announced, that, the, stones, should, not, be, moved, unless, an, oak, tree, was, planted, in, a, stone, s, new, location, 7, 000, oak, trees, were, then, planted, in, kassel, germany, this, project, exemplified, the, idea, that, a, social, sculpture, was, defined, as, interdisciplinary, and, participatory, beuys, wanted, to, effect, environmental, and, social, change, through, this, project, the, dia, art, foundation, is, perpetuating, his, project, and, has, planted, more, trees, and, paired, them, with, basalt, stones, too, beuys, said, that, my, point, with, these, seven, thousand, trees, was, that, each, would, be, a, monument, consisting, of, a, living, part, the, live, tree, changing, all, the, time, and, a, crystalline, mass, maintaining, its, shape, size, and, weight, this, stone, can, be, transformed, only, by, taking, from, it, when, a, piece, splinters, off, say, never, by, growing, by, placing, these, two, objects, side, by, side, the, proportionality, of, the, monument, s, two, parts, will, never, be, the, same, in, 1982, beuys, recorded, a, music, video, for, a, song, he, had, written, entitled, sonne, statt, reagan, which, translates, to, sun, not, rain, reagan, an, anti, reagan, political, piece, that, included, some, german, puns, and, reinforced, some, key, messages, of, beuys, s, career, at, least, after, his, days, as, a, soldier, namely, a, liberal, pacifist, political, attitude, a, desire, to, perpetuate, open, discourse, about, art, and, politics, a, refusal, to, sanctify, his, own, image, and, artistic, reputation, by, only, doing, the, kinds, of, work, other, people, expected, he, would, do, and, above, all, an, openness, to, exploring, different, media, forms, to, get, across, the, messages, he, wanted, to, convey, his, continued, commitment, to, the, demystification, and, dis, institutionalization, of, the, art, world, was, never, more, clear, than, it, is, here, beuys, made, it, clear, that, he, regarded, this, song, as, a, work, of, art, not, the, pop, product, it, appears, to, be, which, is, apparent, from, the, moment, one, views, it, this, becomes, clearer, when, one, reads, the, lyrics, which, are, aimed, directly, at, reagan, the, military, complex, and, whoever, is, trying, to, defrost, the, cold, war, to, make, it, hot, the, song, is, perhaps, best, understood, in, the, context, of, intense, liberal, and, progressive, frustration, in, 1982, beuys, warns, reagan, et, al, that, the, peace, loving, masses, are, behind, him, including, americans, as, well, some, discourse, about, beuys, by, those, who, consider, his, body, of, artwork, sacrosanct, has, avoided, sonne, statt, reagan, regarding, the, video, as, an, outlier, even, to, be, ridiculed, yet, by, choosing, the, vehicle, of, popular, music, beuys, showed, commitment, to, his, views, and, to, engage, a, broad, means, to, have, them, reach, people, among, beuys, s, more, ambitious, pieces, of, social, sculpture, was, the, 7, 000, oaks, project, one, of, enormous, scope, which, met, with, some, controversy, amongst, other, things, beuys, founded, or, co, founded, the, following, political, organisations, german, student, party, 1967, organization, for, direct, democracy, through, referendum, 1971, free, international, university, for, creativity, and, interdisciplinary, research, 1974, and, german, green, party, die, gr, nen, 1980, beuys, became, a, pacifist, and, a, vocal, opponent, of, nuclear, weapons, he, campaigned, for, environmental, causes, in, fact, he, was, elected, as, a, green, party, candidate, for, the, european, parliament, some, of, his, art, directly, addressed, the, political, issues, of, the, day, among, groups, with, which, he, affiliated, his, song, and, music, video, sun, instead, of, reagan, 1982, expresses, the, theme, of, regeneration, optimism, growth, hope, running, through, his, life, and, work, as, well, as, his, interest, in, contemporary, nuclear, politics, but, we, want, sun, instead, of, reagan, to, live, without, weapons, whether, west, whether, east, let, missiles, rust, the, guggenheim, retrospective, and, catalogue, offered, a, comprehensive, view, of, beuys, s, practice, and, rhetoric, to, an, american, critical, audience, although, for, some, time, he, had, been, a, central, figure, in, the, post, war, european, artistic, consciousness, his, work, to, that, point, had, had, only, fleeting, and, partial, exposure, among, american, audiences, in, 1980, building, on, scepticism, voiced, by, belgian, artist, marcel, broodthaers, who, in, a, 1972, open, letter, had, compared, beuys, to, wagner, art, historian, benjamin, buchloh, who, was, teaching, at, staatliche, kunstakademie, just, like, beuys, launched, a, polemically, forceful, attack, on, beuys, the, essay, was, a, vitriolic, and, extensive, critique, of, both, beuys, s, rhetoric, referred, to, as, simple, minded, utopian, drivel, and, persona, buchloh, regards, beuys, as, both, infantile, and, messianic, first, buchloh, notes, beuys, fictionalisation, of, his, own, biography, which, he, sees, as, symptomatic, of, a, dangerous, cultural, tendency, to, disavow, past, trauma, and, retreat, into, the, realms, of, myth, and, esoteric, symbolism, buchloh, critiques, beuys, for, failing, to, acknowledge, and, engage, with, nazism, the, holocaust, and, their, implications, buchloh, then, criticizes, beuys, for, displaying, an, inability, or, reluctance, to, engage, with, the, consequences, of, the, work, of, marcel, duchamp, in, particular, a, failure, to, acknowledge, the, framing, function, of, the, art, institution, and, the, inevitable, dependence, upon, such, institutions, to, create, meaning, for, art, objects, if, beuys, championed, art, s, power, to, foster, political, transformation, buchloh, asserts, that, beuys, nevertheless, failed, to, acknowledge, the, limits, imposed, upon, such, aspirations, by, the, art, museum, and, dealership, networks, which, he, asserts, may, serve, somewhat, less, utopian, ambitions, for, buchloh, rather, than, acknowledging, the, collective, and, contextual, formation, of, meaning, beuys, instead, tried, to, prescribe, and, control, the, meanings, of, his, art, often, through, dubious, esoteric, or, symbolic, codings, buchloh, s, critique, has, been, expounded, upon, by, commentators, like, stefan, germer, and, rosalind, krauss, buchloh, s, critique, has, been, subject, to, revision, his, attention, is, given, to, dismantling, a, mythologized, artistic, persona, and, utopian, rhetoric, which, he, regarded, to, be, irresponsible, since, buchloh, s, essay, was, published, however, much, new, archival, material, has, come, to, light, most, significantly, beuys, proposal, for, an, auschwitz, birkenau, memorial, submitted, in, 1958, some, argue, that, the, existence, of, such, a, project, invalidates, buchloh, s, claim, that, beuys, retreated, from, engaging, with, the, nazi, legacy, a, point, that, buchloh, himself, has, acknowledged, although, the, charges, of, romanticism, and, self, mythologizing, remain, beuys, charisma, and, eclecticism, may, have, polarized, some, of, his, audience, his, work, has, attracted, admirers, and, devotees, some, who, may, uncritically, accept, beuys, own, explanations, as, interpretive, solutions, to, his, work, in, contrast, some, of, those, in, buchloh, s, camp, charge, beuys, with, weak, rhetoric, and, arguments, and, dismiss, his, work, as, bogus, relatively, few, accounts, have, addressed, works, themselves, with, the, exception, of, scholarship, from, art, historians, like, gene, ray, claudia, mesch, christa, maria, lerm, hayes, briony, fer, alex, potts, and, others, the, drive, here, has, been, to, separate, beuys, work, from, his, rhetoric, and, to, explore, both, wider, discursive, formations, within, which, beuys, operated, this, time, productively, and, the, physical, properties, of, the, works, themselves, examples, of, contemporary, artists, who, have, drawn, from, the, legacy, of, beuys, include, aa, bronson, former, member, of, the, artists, collaborative, general, idea, who, not,
