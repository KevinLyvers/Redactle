titus, his, two, predecessors, on, the, throne, he, was, the, last, member, of, the, flavian, dynasty, described, as, a, ruthless, but, efficient, autocrat, his, authoritarian, style, of, ruling, put, him, at, sharp, odds, with, the, senate, whose, powers, he, drastically, curtailed, domitian, had, a, minor, and, largely, ceremonial, role, during, the, reigns, of, his, father, and, brother, after, the, death, of, his, brother, domitian, was, declared, emperor, by, the, praetorian, guard, his, 15, year, reign, was, the, longest, since, tiberius, as, emperor, domitian, strengthened, the, economy, by, revaluing, the, roman, coinage, expanded, the, border, defenses, of, the, empire, and, initiated, a, massive, building, program, to, restore, the, damaged, city, of, rome, significant, wars, were, fought, in, britain, where, his, general, agricola, attempted, to, conquer, caledonia, scotland, and, in, dacia, where, domitian, was, unable, to, achieve, a, decisive, victory, against, king, decebalus, domitian, s, government, exhibited, strong, authoritarian, characteristics, religious, military, and, cultural, propaganda, fostered, a, cult, of, personality, and, by, nominating, himself, as, perpetual, censor, he, sought, to, control, public, and, private, morals, as, a, consequence, domitian, was, popular, with, the, people, and, the, army, but, considered, a, tyrant, by, members, of, the, roman, senate, domitian, s, reign, came, to, an, end, in, 96, when, he, was, assassinated, by, court, officials, he, was, succeeded, the, same, day, by, his, advisor, nerva, after, his, death, domitian, s, memory, was, condemned, to, oblivion, by, the, senate, while, senatorial, and, equestrian, authors, such, as, tacitus, pliny, the, younger, and, suetonius, propagated, the, view, of, domitian, as, a, cruel, and, paranoid, tyrant, modern, revisionists, instead, have, characterized, domitian, as, a, ruthless, but, efficient, autocrat, whose, cultural, economic, and, political, programs, provided, the, foundation, of, the, peaceful, second, century, domitian, was, born, in, rome, on, 24, october, 51, the, youngest, son, of, titus, flavius, vespasianus, commonly, known, as, vespasian, and, flavia, domitilla, major, he, had, an, older, sister, domitilla, the, younger, and, brother, also, named, titus, flavius, vespasianus, decades, of, civil, war, during, the, 1st, century, bc, had, contributed, greatly, to, the, demise, of, the, old, aristocracy, of, rome, which, a, new, italian, nobility, gradually, replaced, in, prominence, during, the, early, part, of, the, 1st, century, one, such, family, the, flavians, or, flavia, gens, rose, from, relative, obscurity, to, prominence, in, just, four, generations, acquiring, wealth, and, status, under, the, emperors, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, domitian, s, great, grandfather, titus, flavius, petro, had, served, as, a, centurion, under, pompey, during, caesar, s, civil, war, his, military, career, ended, in, disgrace, when, he, fled, the, battlefield, at, the, battle, of, pharsalus, in, 48, bc, nevertheless, petro, managed, to, improve, his, status, by, marrying, the, extremely, wealthy, tertulla, whose, fortune, guaranteed, the, upward, mobility, of, petro, s, son, titus, flavius, sabinus, domitian, s, grandfather, sabinus, himself, amassed, further, wealth, and, possible, equestrian, status, through, his, services, as, tax, collector, in, asia, and, banker, in, helvetia, modern, switzerland, by, marrying, vespasia, polla, he, allied, the, flavian, family, to, the, more, prestigious, gens, vespasia, ensuring, the, elevation, of, his, sons, titus, flavius, sabinus, and, vespasian, to, senatorial, rank, the, political, career, of, vespasian, included, the, offices, of, quaestor, aedile, and, praetor, and, culminated, in, a, consulship, in, 51, the, year, of, domitian, s, birth, as, a, military, commander, vespasian, gained, early, renown, by, participating, in, the, roman, invasion, of, britain, in, 43, nevertheless, ancient, sources, allege, poverty, for, the, flavian, family, at, the, time, of, domitian, s, upbringing, even, claiming, vespasian, had, fallen, into, disrepute, under, the, emperors, caligula, 37, 41, and, nero, 54, 68, modern, history, has, refuted, these, claims, suggesting, these, stories, later, circulated, under, flavian, rule, as, part, of, a, propaganda, campaign, to, diminish, success, under, the, less, reputable, emperors, of, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, and, to, maximize, achievements, under, emperor, claudius, 41, 54, and, his, son, britannicus, by, all, appearances, the, flavians, enjoyed, high, imperial, favour, throughout, the, 40s, and, 60s, while, titus, received, a, court, education, in, the, company, of, britannicus, vespasian, pursued, a, successful, political, and, military, career, following, a, prolonged, period, of, retirement, during, the, 50s, he, returned, to, public, office, under, nero, serving, as, proconsul, of, the, africa, province, in, 63, and, accompanying, the, emperor, nero, during, an, official, tour, of, greece, in, 66, that, same, year, jews, from, the, province, of, judaea, revolted, against, the, roman, empire, sparking, what, is, now, known, as, the, first, jewish, roman, war, vespasian, was, assigned, to, lead, the, roman, army, against, the, insurgents, with, titus, who, had, completed, his, military, education, by, this, time, in, charge, of, a, legion, of, the, three, flavian, emperors, domitian, would, rule, the, longest, despite, the, fact, that, his, youth, and, early, career, were, largely, spent, in, the, shadow, of, his, older, brother, titus, had, gained, military, renown, during, the, first, jewish, roman, war, after, their, father, vespasian, became, emperor, in, 69, following, the, civil, war, known, as, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, titus, held, a, great, many, offices, while, domitian, received, honours, but, no, responsibilities, by, the, time, he, was, 16, years, old, domitian, s, mother, and, sister, had, long, since, died, while, his, father, and, brother, were, continuously, active, in, the, roman, military, commanding, armies, in, germania, and, judaea, for, domitian, this, meant, that, a, significant, part, of, his, adolescence, was, spent, in, the, absence, of, his, near, relatives, during, the, jewish, roman, wars, he, was, likely, taken, under, the, care, of, his, uncle, titus, flavius, sabinus, ii, at, the, time, serving, as, city, prefect, of, rome, or, possibly, even, marcus, cocceius, nerva, a, loyal, friend, of, the, flavians, and, the, future, successor, to, domitian, he, received, the, education, of, a, young, man, of, the, privileged, senatorial, class, studying, rhetoric, and, literature, in, his, biography, in, the, lives, of, the, twelve, caesars, suetonius, attests, to, domitian, s, ability, to, quote, the, important, poets, and, writers, such, as, homer, or, virgil, on, appropriate, occasions, and, describes, him, as, a, learned, and, educated, adolescent, with, elegant, conversation, among, his, first, published, works, were, poetry, as, well, as, writings, on, law, and, administration, unlike, his, brother, titus, domitian, was, not, educated, at, court, whether, he, received, formal, military, training, is, not, recorded, but, according, to, suetonius, he, displayed, considerable, marksmanship, with, the, bow, and, arrow, a, detailed, description, of, domitian, s, appearance, and, character, is, provided, by, suetonius, who, devotes, a, substantial, part, of, his, biography, to, his, personality, he, was, tall, of, stature, with, a, modest, expression, and, a, high, colour, his, eyes, were, large, but, his, sight, was, somewhat, dim, he, was, handsome, and, graceful, too, especially, when, a, young, man, and, indeed, in, his, whole, body, with, the, exception, of, his, feet, the, toes, of, which, were, somewhat, cramped, in, later, life, he, had, the, further, disfigurement, of, baldness, a, protruding, belly, and, spindling, legs, though, the, latter, had, become, thin, from, a, long, illness, domitian, was, allegedly, extremely, sensitive, regarding, his, baldness, which, he, disguised, in, later, life, by, wearing, wigs, according, to, suetonius, he, even, wrote, a, book, on, the, subject, of, hair, care, with, regard, to, domitian, s, personality, however, the, account, of, suetonius, alternates, sharply, between, portraying, domitian, as, the, emperor, tyrant, a, man, both, physically, and, intellectually, lazy, and, the, intelligent, refined, personality, drawn, elsewhere, historian, brian, jones, concludes, in, the, emperor, domitian, that, assessing, the, true, nature, of, domitian, s, personality, is, inherently, complicated, by, the, bias, of, the, surviving, sources, common, threads, nonetheless, emerge, from, the, available, evidence, he, appears, to, have, lacked, the, natural, charisma, of, his, brother, and, father, he, was, prone, to, suspicion, displayed, an, odd, sometimes, self, deprecating, sense, of, humour, and, often, communicated, in, cryptic, ways, this, ambiguity, of, character, was, further, exacerbated, by, his, remoteness, and, as, he, grew, older, he, increasingly, displayed, a, preference, for, solitude, which, may, have, stemmed, from, his, isolated, upbringing, indeed, by, the, age, of, eighteen, nearly, all, of, his, closest, relatives, had, died, by, war, or, disease, having, spent, the, greater, part, of, his, early, life, in, the, twilight, of, nero, s, reign, domitian, s, formative, years, would, have, been, strongly, influenced, by, the, political, turmoil, of, the, 60s, culminating, with, the, civil, war, of, 69, which, brought, his, family, to, power, on, 9, june, 68, amid, growing, opposition, of, the, senate, and, the, army, nero, committed, suicide, and, with, him, the, julio, claudian, dynasty, came, to, an, end, chaos, ensued, leading, to, a, year, of, brutal, civil, war, known, as, the, year, of, the, four, emperors, during, which, the, four, most, influential, generals, in, the, roman, empire, galba, otho, vitellius, and, vespasian, successively, vied, for, imperial, power, news, of, nero, s, death, reached, vespasian, as, he, was, preparing, to, besiege, the, city, of, jerusalem, almost, simultaneously, the, senate, had, declared, galba, then, governor, of, hispania, tarraconensis, modern, northern, spain, as, emperor, of, rome, rather, than, continue, his, campaign, vespasian, decided, to, await, further, orders, and, send, titus, to, greet, the, new, emperor, before, reaching, italy, titus, learnt, that, galba, had, been, murdered, and, replaced, by, otho, the, governor, of, lusitania, modern, portugal, at, the, same, time, vitellius, and, his, armies, in, germania, had, risen, in, revolt, and, prepared, to, march, on, rome, intent, on, overthrowing, otho, not, wanting, to, risk, being, taken, hostage, by, one, side, or, the, other, titus, abandoned, the, journey, to, rome, and, rejoined, his, father, in, judaea, otho, and, vitellius, realized, the, potential, threat, posed, by, the, flavian, faction, with, four, legions, at, his, disposal, vespasian, commanded, a, strength, of, nearly, 80, 000, soldiers, his, position, in, judaea, further, granted, him, the, advantage, of, being, nearest, to, the, vital, province, of, egypt, which, controlled, the, grain, supply, to, rome, his, brother, titus, flavius, sabinus, ii, as, city, prefect, commanded, the, entire, city, garrison, of, rome, tensions, among, the, flavian, troops, ran, high, but, so, long, as, either, galba, or, otho, remained, in, power, vespasian, refused, to, take, action, when, otho, was, defeated, by, vitellius, at, the, first, battle, of, bedriacum, the, armies, in, judaea, and, egypt, took, matters, into, their, own, hands, and, declared, vespasian, emperor, on, 1, july, 69, vespasian, accepted, and, entered, an, alliance, with, gaius, licinius, mucianus, the, governor, of, syria, against, vitellius, a, strong, force, drawn, from, the, judaean, and, syrian, legions, marched, on, rome, under, the, command, of, mucianus, while, vespasian, travelled, to, alexandria, leaving, titus, in, charge, of, ending, the, jewish, rebellion, in, rome, domitian, was, placed, under, house, arrest, by, vitellius, as, a, safeguard, against, flavian, aggression, support, for, the, old, emperor, waned, as, more, legions, around, the, empire, pledged, their, allegiance, to, vespasian, on, 24, october, 69, the, forces, of, vitellius, and, vespasian, under, marcus, antonius, primus, met, at, the, second, battle, of, bedriacum, which, ended, in, a, crushing, defeat, for, the, armies, of, vitellius, in, despair, vitellius, attempted, to, negotiate, a, surrender, terms, of, peace, including, a, voluntary, abdication, were, agreed, upon, with, titus, flavius, sabinus, ii, but, the, soldiers, of, the, praetorian, guard, the, imperial, bodyguard, considered, such, a, resignation, disgraceful, and, prevented, vitellius, from, carrying, out, the, treaty, on, the, morning, of, 18, december, the, emperor, appeared, to, deposit, the, imperial, insignia, at, the, temple, of, concord, but, at, the, last, minute, retraced, his, steps, to, the, imperial, palace, in, the, confusion, the, leading, men, of, the, state, gathered, at, sabinus, house, proclaiming, vespasian, as, emperor, but, the, multitude, dispersed, when, vitellian, cohorts, clashed, with, the, armed, escort, of, sabinus, who, was, forced, to, retreat, to, the, capitoline, hill, during, the, night, he, was, joined, by, his, relatives, including, domitian, the, armies, of, mucianus, were, nearing, rome, but, the, besieged, flavian, party, did, not, hold, out, for, longer, than, a, day, on, 19, december, vitellianists, burst, onto, the, capitol, and, in, a, skirmish, sabinus, was, captured, and, executed, domitian, managed, to, escape, by, disguising, himself, as, a, worshipper, of, isis, and, spent, the, night, in, safety, with, one, of, his, father, s, supporters, cornelius, primus, by, the, afternoon, of, 20, december, vitellius, was, dead, his, armies, having, been, defeated, by, the, flavian, legions, with, nothing, more, to, be, feared, domitian, came, forward, to, meet, the, invading, forces, he, was, universally, saluted, by, the, title, of, caesar, and, the, mass, of, troops, conducted, him, to, his, father, s, house, the, following, day, 21, december, the, senate, proclaimed, vespasian, emperor, of, the, roman, empire, although, the, war, had, officially, ended, a, state, of, anarchy, and, lawlessness, pervaded, in, the, first, days, following, the, demise, of, vitellius, order, was, properly, restored, by, mucianus, in, early, 70, but, vespasian, did, not, enter, rome, until, september, of, that, year, in, the, meantime, domitian, acted, as, the, representative, of, the, flavian, family, in, the, roman, senate, he, received, the, title, of, caesar, and, was, appointed, praetor, with, consular, power, the, ancient, historian, tacitus, describes, domitian, s, first, speech, in, the, senate, as, brief, and, measured, at, the, same, time, noting, his, ability, to, elude, awkward, questions, domitian, s, authority, was, merely, nominal, foreshadowing, what, was, to, be, his, role, for, at, least, ten, more, years, by, all, accounts, mucianus, held, the, real, power, in, vespasian, s, absence, and, he, was, careful, to, ensure, that, domitian, still, only, eighteen, years, old, did, not, overstep, the, boundaries, of, his, function, strict, control, was, also, maintained, over, the, young, caesar, s, entourage, promoting, away, flavian, generals, such, as, arrius, varus, and, antonius, primus, and, replacing, them, with, more, reliable, men, such, as, arrecinus, clemens, equally, curtailed, by, mucianus, were, domitian, s, military, ambitions, the, civil, war, of, 69, had, severely, destabilized, the, provinces, leading, to, several, local, uprisings, such, as, the, batavian, revolt, in, gaul, batavian, auxiliaries, of, the, rhine, legions, led, by, gaius, julius, civilis, had, rebelled, with, the, aid, of, a, faction, of, treveri, under, the, command, of, julius, classicus, seven, legions, were, sent, from, rome, led, by, vespasian, s, brother, in, law, quintus, petillius, cerialis, although, the, revolt, was, quickly, suppressed, exaggerated, reports, of, disaster, prompted, mucianus, to, depart, the, capital, with, reinforcements, of, his, own, domitian, eagerly, sought, the, opportunity, to, attain, military, glory, and, joined, the, other, officers, with, the, intention, of, commanding, a, legion, of, his, own, according, to, tacitus, mucianus, was, not, keen, on, this, prospect, but, since, he, considered, domitian, a, liability, in, any, capacity, that, was, entrusted, to, him, he, preferred, to, keep, him, close, at, hand, rather, than, in, rome, when, news, arrived, of, cerialis, victory, over, civilis, mucianus, tactfully, dissuaded, domitian, from, pursuing, further, military, endeavours, domitian, then, wrote, to, cerialis, personally, suggesting, he, hand, over, command, of, his, army, but, once, again, he, was, snubbed, with, the, return, of, vespasian, in, late, september, his, political, role, was, rendered, all, but, obsolete, and, domitian, withdrew, from, government, devoting, his, time, to, arts, and, literature, where, his, political, and, military, career, had, ended, in, disappointment, domitian, s, private, affairs, were, more, successful, in, 70, vespasian, attempted, to, arrange, a, dynastic, marriage, between, his, youngest, son, and, the, daughter, of, titus, julia, flavia, but, domitian, was, adamant, in, his, love, for, domitia, longina, going, so, far, as, to, persuade, her, husband, lucius, aelius, lamia, plautius, aelianus, to, divorce, her, so, that, domitian, could, marry, her, himself, despite, its, initial, recklessness, the, alliance, was, very, prestigious, for, both, families, domitia, longina, was, the, younger, daughter, of, gnaeus, domitius, corbulo, a, respected, general, and, honoured, politician, who, had, distinguished, himself, for, his, leadership, in, armenia, following, the, failed, pisonian, conspiracy, against, nero, in, 65, he, had, been, forced, to, commit, suicide, she, was, also, a, granddaughter, of, junia, lepida, a, descendant, of, emperor, augustus, the, new, marriage, not, only, re, established, ties, to, senatorial, opposition, but, also, served, the, broader, flavian, propaganda, of, the, time, which, sought, to, diminish, vespasian, s, political, success, under, nero, instead, connections, to, claudius, and, britannicus, were, emphasised, and, nero, s, victims, or, those, otherwise, disadvantaged, by, him, rehabilitated, in, 80, domitia, and, domitian, s, only, attested, son, was, born, it, is, not, known, what, the, boy, s, name, was, but, he, died, in, childhood, in, 83, shortly, following, his, accession, as, emperor, domitian, bestowed, the, honorific, title, of, augusta, upon, domitia, while, their, son, was, deified, appearing, as, such, on, the, reverse, of, coin, types, from, this, period, nevertheless, the, marriage, appears, to, have, faced, a, significant, crisis, in, 83, for, reasons, unknown, domitian, briefly, exiled, domitia, and, then, soon, recalled, her, either, out, of, love, or, due, to, rumours, that, he, was, carrying, on, a, relationship, with, his, niece, julia, flavia, jones, argues, that, most, likely, he, did, so, for, her, failure, to, produce, an, heir, by, 84, domitia, had, returned, to, the, palace, where, she, lived, for, the, remainder, of, domitian, s, reign, without, incident, little, is, known, of, domitia, s, activities, as, empress, or, how, much, influence, she, wielded, in, domitian, s, government, but, it, seems, her, role, was, limited, from, suetonius, we, know, that, she, at, least, accompanied, the, emperor, to, the, amphitheatre, while, the, jewish, writer, josephus, speaks, of, benefits, he, received, from, her, it, is, not, known, whether, domitian, had, other, children, but, he, did, not, marry, again, despite, allegations, by, roman, sources, of, adultery, and, divorce, the, marriage, appears, to, have, been, happy, before, becoming, emperor, domitian, s, role, in, the, flavian, government, was, largely, ceremonial, in, june, 71, titus, returned, triumphant, from, the, war, in, judaea, ultimately, the, rebellion, had, claimed, the, lives, of, tens, of, thousands, perhaps, hundreds, of, thousands, a, majority, of, whom, were, jewish, the, city, and, temple, of, jerusalem, were, completely, destroyed, its, most, valuable, treasures, carried, off, by, the, roman, army, and, nearly, 100, 000, people, were, captured, and, enslaved, for, his, victory, the, senate, awarded, titus, a, roman, triumph, on, the, day, of, the, festivities, the, flavian, family, rode, into, the, capital, preceded, by, a, lavish, parade, that, displayed, the, spoils, of, the, war, the, family, procession, was, headed, by, vespasian, and, titus, while, domitian, riding, a, magnificent, white, horse, followed, with, the, remaining, flavian, relatives, leaders, of, the, jewish, resistance, were, executed, in, the, forum, romanum, after, which, the, procession, closed, with, religious, sacrifices, at, the, temple, of, jupiter, a, triumphal, arch, the, arch, of, titus, was, erected, at, the, south, east, entrance, to, the, forum, to, commemorate, the, successful, end, of, the, war, yet, the, return, of, titus, further, highlighted, the, comparative, insignificance, of, domitian, both, militarily, and, politically, as, the, eldest, and, most, experienced, of, vespasian, s, sons, titus, shared, tribunician, power, with, his, father, received, seven, consulships, the, censorship, and, was, given, command, of, the, praetorian, guard, powers, that, left, no, doubt, he, was, the, designated, heir, to, the, empire, as, a, second, son, domitian, held, honorary, titles, such, as, caesar, or, princeps, iuventutis, and, several, priesthoods, including, those, of, augur, pontifex, frater, arvalis, magister, frater, arvalium, and, sacerdos, collegiorum, omnium, but, no, office, with, imperium, he, held, six, consulships, during, vespasian, s, reign, but, only, one, of, these, in, 73, was, an, ordinary, consulship, the, other, five, were, less, prestigious, suffect, consulships, which, he, held, in, 71, 75, 76, 77, and, 79, respectively, usually, replacing, his, father, or, brother, in, mid, january, while, ceremonial, these, offices, no, doubt, gained, domitian, valuable, experience, in, the, roman, senate, and, may, have, contributed, to, his, later, reservations, about, its, relevance, under, vespasian, and, titus, non, flavians, were, virtually, excluded, from, the, important, public, offices, mucianus, himself, all, but, disappeared, from, historical, records, during, this, time, and, it, is, believed, he, died, sometime, between, 75, and, 77, real, power, was, unmistakably, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, the, flavian, faction, the, weakened, senate, only, maintained, the, facade, of, democracy, because, titus, effectively, acted, as, co, emperor, with, his, father, no, abrupt, change, in, flavian, policy, occurred, when, vespasian, died, on, 24, june, 79, titus, assured, domitian, that, full, partnership, in, the, government, would, soon, be, his, but, neither, tribunician, power, nor, imperium, of, any, kind, was, conferred, upon, him, during, titus, brief, reign, two, major, disasters, struck, during, 79, and, 80, in, october, november, 79, mount, vesuvius, erupted, burying, the, surrounding, cities, of, pompeii, and, herculaneum, under, metres, of, ash, and, lava, the, following, year, a, fire, broke, out, in, rome, that, lasted, three, days, and, destroyed, a, number, of, important, public, buildings, consequently, titus, spent, much, of, his, reign, coordinating, relief, efforts, and, restoring, damaged, property, on, 13, september, 81, after, barely, two, years, in, office, he, unexpectedly, died, of, fever, during, a, trip, to, the, sabine, territories, ancient, authors, have, implicated, domitian, in, the, death, of, his, brother, either, by, directly, accusing, him, of, murder, or, implying, he, left, the, ailing, titus, for, dead, even, alleging, that, during, his, lifetime, domitian, was, openly, plotting, against, his, brother, it, is, difficult, to, assess, the, factual, veracity, of, these, statements, given, the, known, bias, of, the, surviving, sources, brotherly, affection, was, likely, at, a, minimum, but, this, was, hardly, surprising, considering, that, domitian, had, barely, seen, titus, after, the, age, of, seven, whatever, the, nature, of, their, relationship, domitian, seems, to, have, displayed, little, sympathy, when, his, brother, lay, dying, instead, making, for, the, praetorian, camp, where, he, was, proclaimed, emperor, the, following, day, 14, september, the, senate, confirmed, domitian, s, powers, granting, tribunician, power, the, office, of, pontifex, maximus, and, the, titles, of, augustus, venerable, and, pater, patriae, father, of, the, country, as, emperor, domitian, quickly, dispensed, with, the, republican, facade, his, father, and, brother, had, maintained, during, their, reign, by, moving, the, centre, of, government, to, the, imperial, court, domitian, openly, rendered, the, senate, s, powers, obsolete, according, to, pliny, the, younger, domitian, believed, that, the, roman, empire, was, to, be, governed, as, a, divine, monarchy, with, himself, as, the, benevolent, despot, at, its, head, in, addition, to, exercising, absolute, political, power, domitian, believed, the, emperor, s, role, encompassed, every, aspect, of, daily, life, guiding, the, roman, people, as, a, cultural, and, moral, authority, to, usher, in, the, new, era, he, embarked, on, ambitious, economic, military, and, cultural, programs, with, the, intention, of, restoring, the, empire, to, the, splendour, it, had, seen, under, the, emperor, augustus, despite, these, grand, designs, domitian, was, determined, to, govern, the, empire, conscientiously, and, scrupulously, he, became, personally, involved, in, all, branches, of, the, administration, edicts, were, issued, governing, the, smallest, details, of, everyday, life, and, law, while, taxation, and, public, morals, were, rigidly, enforced, according, to, suetonius, the, imperial, bureaucracy, never, ran, more, efficiently, than, under, domitian, whose, exacting, standards, and, suspicious, nature, maintained, historically, low, corruption, among, provincial, governors, and, elected, officials, although, he, made, no, pretence, regarding, the, significance, of, the, senate, under, his, absolute, rule, those, senators, he, deemed, unworthy, were, expelled, from, the, senate, and, in, the, distribution, of, public, offices, he, rarely, favored, family, members, a, policy, that, stood, in, contrast, to, the, nepotism, practiced, by, vespasian, and, titus, above, all, however, domitian, valued, loyalty, and, malleability, in, those, he, assigned, to, strategic, posts, qualities, he, found, more, often, in, men, of, the, equestrian, order, than, in, members, of, the, senate, or, his, own, family, whom, he, regarded, with, suspicion, and, promptly, removed, from, office, if, they, disagreed, with, imperial, policy, the, reality, of, domitian, s, autocracy, was, further, highlighted, by, the, fact, that, more, than, any, emperor, since, tiberius, he, spent, significant, periods, of, time, away, from, the, capital, although, the, senate, s, power, had, been, in, decline, since, the, fall, of, the, republic, under, domitian, the, seat, of, power, was, no, longer, even, in, rome, but, rather, wherever, the, emperor, was, until, the, completion, of, the, flavian, palace, on, the, palatine, hill, the, imperial, court, was, situated, at, alba, or, circeii, and, sometimes, even, farther, afield, domitian, toured, the, european, provinces, extensively, and, spent, at, least, three, years, of, his, reign, in, germania, and, illyricum, conducting, military, campaigns, on, the, frontiers, of, the, empire, for, his, personal, use, he, was, active, in, constructing, many, monumental, buildings, including, the, villa, of, domitian, a, vast, and, sumptuous, palace, situated, 20, km, outside, rome, in, the, alban, hills, in, rome, itself, he, built, the, palace, of, domitian, on, the, palatine, hill, seven, other, villas, are, linked, with, domitian, at, tusculum, antium, sabaudia, vicarello, caieta, terracina, and, baiae, only, that, at, sabaudia, has, been, positively, identified, the, stadium, of, domitian, was, dedicated, in, 86, ad, as, a, gift, to, the, people, of, rome, as, part, of, an, imperial, building, program, following, the, damage, or, destruction, of, most, of, the, buildings, on, the, field, of, mars, by, fire, in, 79, ad, it, was, rome, s, first, permanent, venue, for, competitive, athletics, and, is, today, occupied, by, the, piazza, navona, in, egypt, too, domitian, was, quite, active, in, constructing, buildings, and, decorating, them, he, appears, together, with, trajan, in, offering, scenes, on, the, propylon, of, the, temple, of, hathor, at, dendera, his, cartouche, also, appears, in, the, column, shafts, of, the, temple, of, khnum, at, esna, domitian, s, tendency, towards, micromanagement, was, nowhere, more, evident, than, in, his, financial, policy, the, question, of, whether, domitian, left, the, roman, empire, in, debt, or, with, a, surplus, at, the, time, of, his, death, has, been, fiercely, debated, the, evidence, points, to, a, balanced, economy, for, the, greater, part, of, domitian, s, reign, upon, his, accession, he, revalued, the, roman, currency, dramatically, he, increased, the, silver, purity, of, the, denarius, from, 90, to, 98, the, actual, silver, weight, increasing, from, 2, 87, grams, to, 3, 26, grams, a, financial, crisis, in, 85, forced, a, devaluation, of, the, silver, purity, and, weight, to, 93, 5, and, 3, 04, grams, respectively, nevertheless, the, new, values, were, still, higher, than, the, levels, that, vespasian, and, titus, had, maintained, during, their, reigns, domitian, s, rigorous, taxation, policy, ensured, that, this, standard, was, sustained, for, the, following, eleven, years, coinage, from, this, era, displays, a, highly, consistent, degree, of, quality, including, meticulous, attention, to, domitian, s, titulature, and, refined, artwork, on, the, reverse, portraits, jones, estimates, domitian, s, annual, income, at, more, than, 1, 2, billion, sestertii, of, which, over, one, third, would, presumably, have, been, spent, maintaining, the, roman, army, the, other, major, expense, was, the, extensive, reconstruction, of, rome, at, the, time, of, domitian, s, accession, the, city, was, still, suffering, from, the, damage, caused, by, the, great, fire, of, 64, the, civil, war, of, 69, and, the, fire, in, 80, much, more, than, a, renovation, project, domitian, s, building, program, was, intended, to, be, the, crowning, achievement, of, an, empire, wide, cultural, renaissance, around, fifty, structures, were, erected, restored, or, completed, achievements, second, only, to, those, of, augustus, among, the, most, important, new, structures, were, an, odeon, a, stadium, and, an, expansive, palace, on, the, palatine, hill, known, as, the, flavian, palace, which, was, designed, by, domitian, s, master, architect, rabirius, the, most, important, building, domitian, restored, was, the, temple, of, jupiter, optimus, maximus, on, the, capitoline, hill, said, to, have, been, covered, with, a, gilded, roof, among, those, completed, were, the, temple, of, vespasian, and, titus, the, arch, of, titus, and, the, flavian, amphitheatre, colosseum, to, which, he, added, a, fourth, level, and, finished, the, interior, seating, area, in, order, to, appease, the, people, of, rome, an, estimated, 135, million, sestertii, was, spent, on, donatives, or, congiaria, throughout, domitian, s, reign, the, emperor, also, revived, the, practice, of, public, banquets, which, had, been, reduced, to, a, simple, distribution, of, food, under, nero, while, he, invested, large, sums, on, entertainment, and, games, in, 86, he, founded, the, capitoline, games, a, quadrennial, contest, comprising, athletic, displays, chariot, racing, and, competitions, for, oratory, music, and, acting, the, military, campaigns, undertaken, during, domitian, s, reign, were, generally, defensive, in, nature, as, the, emperor, rejected, the, idea, of, expansionist, warfare, his, most, significant, military, contribution, was, the, development, of, the, limes, germanicus, which, encompassed, a, vast, network, of, roads, forts, and, watchtowers, constructed, along, the, rhine, river, to, defend, the, empire, nevertheless, several, important, wars, were, fought, in, gaul, against, the, chatti, and, across, the, danube, frontier, against, the, suebi, the, sarmatians, and, the, dacians, the, conquest, of, britain, continued, under, the, command, of, gnaeus, julius, agricola, who, expanded, the, roman, empire, as, far, as, caledonia, or, modern, day, scotland, domitian, also, founded, a, new, legion, in, 82, the, legio, i, minervia, to, fight, against, the, chatti, domitian, is, also, credited, on, the, easternmost, evidence, of, roman, military, presence, the, rock, inscription, near, boyukdash, mountain, in, present, day, azerbaijan, as, judged, by, the, carved, titles, of, caesar, augustus, and, germanicus, the, related, march, took, place, between, 84, and, 96, ad, domitian, s, administration, of, the, roman, army, was, characterized, by, the, same, fastidious, involvement, he, exhibited, in, other, branches, of, the, government, his, competence, as, a, military, strategist, was, criticized, by, his, contemporaries, however, although, he, claimed, several, triumphs, these, were, largely, propaganda, manoeuvres, tacitus, derided, domitian, s, victory, against, the, chatti, as, a, mock, triumph, and, criticized, his, decision, to, retreat, in, britain, following, the, conquests, of, agricola, nevertheless, domitian, appears, to, have, been, very, popular, among, the, soldiers, spending, an, estimated, three, years, of, his, reign, among, the, army, on, campaigns, more, than, any, emperor, since, augustus, and, raising, their, pay, by, one, third, while, the, army, command, may, have, disapproved, of, his, tactical, and, strategic, decisions, the, loyalty, of, the, common, soldier, was, unquestioned, once, emperor, domitian, immediately, sought, to, attain, his, long, delayed, military, glory, as, early, as, 82, or, possibly, 83, he, went, to, gaul, ostensibly, to, conduct, a, census, and, suddenly, ordered, an, attack, on, the, chatti, for, this, purpose, a, new, legion, was, founded, legio, i, minervia, which, constructed, some, 75, kilometres, 46, mi, of, roads, through, chattan, territory, to, uncover, the, enemy, s, hiding, places, although, little, information, survives, of, the, battles, fought, enough, early, victories, were, apparently, achieved, for, domitian, to, be, back, in, rome, by, the, end, of, 83, where, he, celebrated, an, elaborate, triumph, and, conferred, upon, himself, the, title, of, germanicus, domitian, s, supposed, victory, was, much, scorned, by, ancient, authors, who, described, the, campaign, as, uncalled, for, and, a, mock, triumph, the, evidence, lends, some, credence, to, these, claims, as, the, chatti, would, later, play, a, significant, role, during, the, revolt, of, saturninus, in, 89, one, of, the, most, detailed, reports, of, military, activity, under, the, flavian, dynasty, was, written, by, tacitus, whose, biography, of, his, father, in, law, gnaeus, julius, agricola, largely, concerns, the, conquest, of, northern, britain, between, 77, and, 84, agricola, arrived, c, 77, as, governor, of, roman, britain, immediately, launching, campaigns, into, caledonia, modern, scotland, in, 82, agricola, crossed, an, unidentified, body, of, water, and, defeated, peoples, unknown, to, the, romans, until, then, he, fortified, the, coast, facing, ireland, and, tacitus, recalls, that, his, father, in, law, often, claimed, the, island, could, be, conquered, with, a, single, legion, and, a, few, auxiliaries, he, had, given, refuge, to, an, exiled, irish, king, whom, he, hoped, he, might, use, as, the, excuse, for, conquest, this, conquest, never, happened, but, some, historians, believe, that, the, crossing, referred, to, was, in, fact, a, small, scale, exploratory, or, punitive, expedition, to, ireland, turning, his, attention, from, ireland, the, following, year, agricola, raised, a, fleet, and, pushed, beyond, the, river, forth, into, caledonia, to, aid, the, advance, a, large, legionary, fortress, was, constructed, at, inchtuthil, in, the, summer, of, 84, agricola, faced, the, armies, of, the, caledonians, led, by, calgacus, at, the, battle, of, mons, graupius, although, the, romans, inflicted, heavy, losses, on, the, enemy, two, thirds, of, the, caledonian, army, escaped, and, hid, in, the, scottish, marshes, and, highlands, ultimately, preventing, agricola, from, bringing, the, entire, british, island, under, his, control, in, 85, agricola, was, recalled, to, rome, by, domitian, having, served, for, more, than, six, years, as, governor, longer, than, normal, for, consular, legates, during, the, flavian, era, tacitus, claims, that, domitian, ordered, his, recall, because, agricola, s, successes, outshone, the, emperor, s, own, modest, victories, in, germania, the, relationship, between, agricola, and, the, emperor, is, unclear, on, the, one, hand, agricola, was, awarded, triumphal, decorations, and, a, statue, on, the, other, agricola, never, again, held, a, civil, or, military, post, in, spite, of, his, experience, and, renown, he, was, offered, the, governorship, of, the, province, of, africa, but, declined, it, either, due, to, ill, health, or, as, tacitus, claims, the, machinations, of, domitian, not, long, after, agricola, s, recall, from, britain, the, roman, empire, entered, into, war, with, the, kingdom, of, dacia, in, the, east, reinforcements, were, needed, and, in, 87, or, 88, domitian, ordered, a, large, scale, strategic, withdrawal, of, troops, in, the, british, province, the, fortress, at, inchtuthil, was, dismantled, and, the, caledonian, forts, and, watchtowers, abandoned, moving, the, roman, frontier, some, 120, kilometres, 75, mi, further, south, the, army, command, may, have, resented, domitian, s, decision, to, retreat, but, to, him, the, caledonian, territories, never, represented, anything, more, than, a, loss, to, the, roman, treasury, the, most, significant, threat, the, roman, empire, faced, during, the, reign, of, domitian, arose, from, the, northern, provinces, of, illyricum, where, the, suebi, the, sarmatians, and, the, dacians, continuously, harassed, roman, settlements, along, the, danube, river, of, these, the, sarmatians, and, the, dacians, posed, the, most, formidable, threat, in, approximately, 84, or, 85, the, dacians, led, by, king, decebalus, crossed, the, danube, into, the, province, of, moesia, wreaking, havoc, and, killing, the, moesian, governor, oppius, sabinus, domitian, quickly, launched, a, counteroffensive, personally, travelling, to, the, region, accompanied, by, a, large, force, commanded, by, his, praetorian, prefect, cornelius, fuscus, fuscus, successfully, drove, the, dacians, back, across, the, border, in, mid, 85, prompting, domitian, to, return, to, rome, and, celebrate, his, second, triumph, the, victory, proved, short, lived, however, as, early, in, 86, fuscus, embarked, on, an, ill, fated, expedition, into, dacia, fuscus, was, killed, and, the, battle, standard, of, the, praetorian, guard, was, lost, the, loss, of, the, battle, standard, or, aquila, was, indicative, of, a, crushing, defeat, and, a, serious, affront, to, roman, national, pride, domitian, returned, to, moesia, in, august, 86, he, divided, the, province, into, lower, moesia, and, upper, moesia, and, transferred, three, additional, legions, to, the, danube, in, 87, the, romans, invaded, dacia, once, more, this, time, under, the, command, of, tettius, julianus, and, finally, defeated, decebalus, in, late, 88, at, the, same, site, where, fuscus, had, previously, perished, an, attack, on, the, dacian, capital, sarmizegetusa, was, forestalled, when, new, troubles, arose, on, the, german, frontier, in, 89, in, order, to, avert, having, to, conduct, a, war, on, two, fronts, domitian, agreed, to, terms, of, peace, with, decebalus, negotiating, free, access, of, roman, troops, through, the, dacian, region, while, granting, decebalus, an, annual, subsidy, of, 8, million, sesterces, contemporary, authors, severely, criticized, this, treaty, which, was, considered, shameful, to, the, romans, and, left, the, deaths, of, sabinus, and, fuscus, unavenged, for, the, remainder, of, domitian, s, reign, dacia, remained, a, relatively, peaceful, client, kingdom, but, decebalus, used, the, roman, money, to, fortify, his, defenses, domitian, probably, wanted, a, new, war, against, the, dacians, and, reinforced, upper, moesia, with, two, more, cavalry, units, brought, from, syria, and, with, at, least, five, cohorts, brought, from, pannonia, trajan, continued, domitian, s, policy, and, added, two, more, units, to, the, auxiliary, forces, of, upper, moesia, and, then, he, used, the, build, up, of, troops, for, his, dacian, wars, eventually, the, romans, achieved, a, decisive, victory, against, decebalus, in, 106, again, the, roman, army, sustained, heavy, losses, but, trajan, succeeded, in, capturing, sarmizegetusa, and, importantly, annexed, the, dacian, gold, and, silver, mines, domitian, firmly, believed, in, the, traditional, roman, religion, and, personally, saw, to, it, that, ancient, customs, and, morals, were, observed, throughout, his, reign, in, order, to, justify, the, divine, nature, of, the, flavian, rule, domitian, emphasized, connections, with, the, chief, deity, jupiter, perhaps, most, significantly, through, the, impressive, restoration, of, the, temple, of, jupiter, on, the, capitoline, hill, a, small, chapel, dedicated, to, jupiter, conservator, was, also, constructed, near, the, house, where, domitian, had, fled, to, safety, on, 20, december, 69, later, in, his, reign, he, replaced, it, with, a, more, expansive, building, dedicated, to, jupiter, custos, the, goddess, he, worshipped, the, most, zealously, however, was, minerva, not, only, did, he, keep, a, personal, shrine, dedicated, to, her, in, his, bedroom, she, regularly, appeared, on, his, coinage, in, four, different, attested, reverse, types, and, he, founded, a, legion, legio, i, minervia, in, her, name, domitian, also, revived, the, practice, of, the, imperial, cult, which, had, fallen, somewhat, out, of, use, under, vespasian, significantly, his, first, act, as, emperor, was, the, deification, of, his, brother, titus, upon, their, deaths, his, infant, son, and, niece, julia, flavia, were, likewise, enrolled, among, the, gods, with, regards, to, the, emperor, himself, as, a, religious, figure, both, suetonius, and, cassius, dio, allege, that, domitian, officially, gave, himself, the, title, of, dominus, et, deus, lord, and, god, however, not, only, did, he, reject, the, title, of, dominus, during, his, reign, but, since, he, issued, no, official, documentation, or, coinage, to, this, effect, historians, such, as, brian, jones, contend, that, such, phrases, were, addressed, to, domitian, by, flatterers, who, wished, to, earn, favors, from, him, to, foster, the, worship, of, the, imperial, family, he, erected, a, dynastic, mausoleum, on, the, site, of, vespasian, s, former, house, on, the, quirinal, and, completed, the, temple, of, vespasian, and, titus, a, shrine, dedicated, to, the, worship, of, his, deified, father, and, brother, to, memorialize, the, military, triumphs, of, the, flavian, family, he, ordered, the, construction, of, the, templum, divorum, and, the, templum, fortuna, redux, and, completed, the, arch, of, titus, construction, projects, such, as, these, constituted, only, the, most, visible, part, of, domitian, s, religious, policy, which, also, concerned, itself, with, the, fulfilment, of, religious, law, and, public, morals, in, 85, he, nominated, himself, perpetual, censor, the, office, that, held, the, task, of, supervising, roman, morals, and, conduct, once, again, domitian, acquitted, himself, of, this, task, dutifully, and, with, care, he, renewed, the, lex, iulia, de, adulteriis, coercendis, under, which, adultery, was, punishable, by, exile, from, the, list, of, jurors, he, struck, an, equestrian, who, had, divorced, his, wife, and, taken, her, back, while, an, ex, quaestor, was, expelled, from, the, senate, for, acting, and, dancing, as, eunuchs, were, popularly, used, as, servants, domitian, punished, people, who, castrated, others, and, wanted, to, ban, the, eunuchs, themselves, subsequent, emperors, made, similar, prohibitions, but, domitian, may, have, been, the, first, to, do, so, despite, his, moralizing, domitian, had, his, own, favorite, eunuch, boy, earinus, who, was, commemorated, by, the, contemporary, court, poets, martial, and, statius, domitian, also, heavily, prosecuted, corruption, among, public, officials, removing, jurors, if, they, accepted, bribes, and, rescinding, legislation, when, a, conflict, of, interest, was, suspected, he, ensured, that, libellous, writings, especially, those, directed, against, himself, were, punishable, by, exile, or, death, actors, were, likewise, regarded, with, suspicion, consequently, he, forbade, mimes, from, appearing, on, stage, in, public, philosophers, did, not, fare, much, better, epictetus, who, had, set, himself, up, in, rome, as, a, professor, of, philosophy, remarked, that, philosophers, were, able, to, look, tyrants, steadily, in, the, face, and, it, was, domitian, s, decree, of, 94, expelling, all, philosophers, from, rome, that, caused, epictetus, to, shift, his, base, to, the, recently, founded, roman, city, of, nicopolis, in, epirus, greece, where, he, lived, simply, worked, safely, and, died, of, old, age, in, 87, vestal, virgins, were, found, to, have, broken, their, sacred, vows, of, lifelong, public, chastity, as, the, vestals, were, regarded, as, daughters, of, the, community, this, offense, essentially, constituted, incest, accordingly, those, found, guilty, of, any, such, transgression, were, condemned, to, death, either, by, a, manner, of, their, choosing, or, according, to, the, ancient, fashion, which, dictated, that, vestals, should, be, buried, alive, foreign, religions, were, tolerated, insofar, as, they, did, not, interfere, with, public, order, or, could, be, assimilated, with, the, traditional, roman, religion, the, worship, of, egyptian, deities, in, particular, flourished, under, the, flavian, dynasty, to, an, extent, not, seen, again, until, the, reign, of, commodus, veneration, of, serapis, and, isis, who, were, identified, with, jupiter, and, minerva, respectively, was, especially, prominent, fourth, century, writings, by, eusebius, maintain, that, jews, and, christians, were, heavily, persecuted, toward, the, end, of, domitian, s, reign, the, book, of, revelation, and, first, epistle, of, clement, are, thought, by, some, to, have, been, written, during, this, period, the, latter, making, mention, of, sudden, and, repeated, misfortunes, which, are, assumed, to, refer, to, persecutions, under, domitian, although, jews, were, heavily, taxed, no, contemporary, authors, give, specific, details, of, trials, or, executions, based, on, religious, offenses, other, than, those, within, the, roman, religion, suetonius, mentions, having, seen, in, his, youth, a, nonagenarian, being, stripped, by, a, procurator, to, see, if, he, was, circumcised, on, 1, january, 89, the, governor, of, germania, superior, lucius, antonius, saturninus, and, his, two, legions, at, mainz, legio, xiv, gemina, and, legio, xxi, rapax, revolted, against, the, roman, empire, with, the, aid, of, the, germanic, chatti, people, the, precise, cause, for, the, rebellion, is, uncertain, although, it, appears, to, have, been, planned, well, in, advance, the, senatorial, officers, may, have, disapproved, of, domitian, s, military, strategies, such, as, his, decision, to, fortify, the, german, frontier, rather, than, attack, as, well, as, his, recent, retreat, from, britain, and, finally, the, disgraceful, policy, of, appeasement, towards, decebalus, at, any, rate, the, uprising, was, strictly, confined, to, saturninus, province, and, quickly, detected, once, the, rumour, spread, across, the, neighbouring, provinces, the, governor, of, germania, inferior, aulus, bucius, lappius, maximus, moved, to, the, region, at, once, assisted, by, titus, flavius, norbanus, the, procurator, of, rhaetia, from, spain, trajan, was, summoned, while, domitian, himself, came, from, rome, with, the, praetorian, guard, by, a, stroke, of, luck, a, thaw, prevented, the, chatti, from, crossing, the, rhine, and, coming, to, saturninus, aid, within, twenty, four, days, the, rebellion, was, crushed, and, its, leaders, at, mainz, savagely, punished, the, mutinous, legions, were, sent, to, the, front, in, illyricum, while, those, who, had, assisted, in, their, defeat, were, duly, rewarded, lappius, maximus, received, the, governorship, of, the, province, of, syria, a, second, consulship, in, may, 95, and, finally, a, priesthood, which, he, still, held, in, 102, titus, flavius, norbanus, may, have, been, appointed, to, the, prefecture, of, egypt, but, almost, certainly, became, prefect, of, the, praetorian, guard, by, 94, with, titus, petronius, secundus, as, his, colleague, domitian, opened, the, year, following, the, revolt, by, sharing, the, consulship, with, marcus, cocceius, nerva, suggesting, the, latter, had, played, a, part, in, uncovering, the, conspiracy, perhaps, in, a, fashion, similar, to, the, one, he, played, during, the, pisonian, conspiracy, under, nero, although, little, is, known, about, the, life, and, career, of, nerva, before, his, accession, as, emperor, in, 96, he, appears, to, have, been, a, highly, adaptable, diplomat, surviving, multiple, regime, changes, and, emerging, as, one, of, the, flavians, most, trusted, advisors, his, consulship, may, therefore, have, been, intended, to, emphasize, the, stability, and, status, quo, of, the, regime, the, revolt, had, been, suppressed, and, the, empire, returned, to, order, since, the, fall, of, the, republic, the, authority, of, the, roman, senate, had, largely, eroded, under, the, quasi, monarchical, system, of, government, established, by, augustus, known, as, the, principate, the, principate, allowed, the, existence, of, a, de, facto, dictatorial, regime, while, maintaining, the, formal, framework, of, the, roman, republic, most, emperors, upheld, the, public, facade, of, democracy, and, in, return, the, senate, implicitly, acknowledged, the, emperor, s, status, as, a, de, facto, monarch, some, rulers, handled, this, arrangement, with, less, subtlety, than, others, domitian, was, not, so, subtle, often, coming, to, the, senate, as, a, triumpher, and, conqueror, to, show, his, disdain, for, them, from, the, outset, of, his, reign, he, stressed, the, reality, of, his, autocracy, he, disliked, aristocrats, and, had, no, fear, of, showing, it, withdrawing, every, decision, making, power, from, the, senate, to, reduce, its, control, to, an, administrative, one, and, instead, relying, on, a, small, set, of, friends, and, equestrians, to, control, the, important, offices, of, state, the, dislike, was, mutual, after, domitian, s, assassination, the, senators, of, rome, rushed, to, the, senate, house, where, they, immediately, passed, a, motion, condemning, his, memory, to, oblivion, under, the, rulers, of, the, nervan, antonian, dynasty, senatorial, authors, published, histories, that, elaborated, on, the, view, of, domitian, as, a, tyrant, nevertheless, the, evidence, suggests, that, domitian, did, make, concessions, toward, senatorial, opinion, whereas, his, father, and, brother, had, concentrated, consular, power, largely, in, the, hands, of, the, flavian, family, domitian, admitted, a, surprisingly, large, number, of, provincials, and, potential, opponents, to, the, consulship, allowing, them, to, head, the, official, calendar, by, opening, the, year, as, an, ordinary, consul, whether, this, was, a, genuine, attempt, to, reconcile, with, hostile, factions, in, the, senate, cannot, be, ascertained, by, offering, the, consulship, to, potential, opponents, domitian, may, have, wanted, to, compromise, these, senators, in, the, eyes, of, their, supporters, when, their, conduct, proved, unsatisfactory, they, were, almost, invariably, brought, to, trial, and, exiled, or, executed, and, their, property, was, confiscated, both, tacitus, and, suetonius, speak, of, escalating, persecutions, toward, the, end, of, domitian, s, reign, identifying, a, point, of, sharp, increase, around, 93, or, sometime, after, the, failed, revolt, of, saturninus, in, 89, at, least, twenty, senatorial, opponents, were, executed, including, domitia, longina, s, former, husband, lucius, aelius, lamia, plautius, aelianus, and, three, of, domitian, s, own, family, members, titus, flavius, sabinus, titus, flavius, clemens, and, marcus, arrecinus, clemens, flavius, clemens, was, a, cousin, of, domitian, and, the, emperor, had, even, designated, clemens, two, young, sons, as, his, successors, calling, them, as, vespasian, and, domitian, some, of, these, men, were, executed, as, early, as, 83, or, 85, however, lending, little, credit, to, tacitus, notion, of, a, reign, of, terror, late, in, domitian, s, reign, according, to, suetonius, some, were, convicted, for, corruption, or, treason, others, on, trivial, charges, which, domitian, justified, through, his, suspicion, he, used, to, say, that, the, lot, of, emperors, was, most, unfortunate, since, when, they, discovered, a, conspiracy, no, one, believed, them, unless, they, had, been, murdered, jones, compares, the, executions, of, domitian, to, those, under, emperor, claudius, 41, 54, noting, that, claudius, executed, around, 35, senators, and, 300, equestrians, and, yet, was, still, deified, by, the, senate, and, regarded, as, one, of, the, good, emperors, of, history, domitian, was, apparently, unable, to, gain, support, among, the, aristocracy, despite, attempts, to, appease, hostile, factions, with, consular, appointments, his, autocratic, style, of, government, accentuated, the, senate, s, loss, of, power, while, his, policy, of, treating, patricians, and, even, family, members, as, equals, to, all, romans, earned, him, their, contempt, domitian, was, assassinated, on, 18, september, 96, in, a, conspiracy, by, court, officials, a, highly, detailed, account, of, the, plot, and, the, assassination, is, provided, by, suetonius, he, alleges, that, domitian, s, chamberlain, parthenius, played, the, main, role, in, the, plot, and, historian, john, grainger, cites, parthenius, likely, fear, over, domitian, s, recent, execution, of, nero, s, former, secretary, epaphroditus, as, a, possible, motive, the, act, itself, was, carried, out, by, a, freedman, of, parthenius, named, maximus, and, a, steward, of, domitian, s, niece, flavia, domitilla, named, stephanus, according, to, suetonius, a, number, of, omens, had, foretold, domitian, s, death, the, germanic, soothsayer, larginus, proclus, predicted, the, date, of, domitian, s, death, and, was, consequently, sentenced, to, death, by, him, several, days, prior, to, the, assassination, minerva, had, appeared, to, the, emperor, in, a, dream, she, announced, that, she, had, been, disarmed, by, jupiter, and, could, no, longer, give, domitian, her, protection, according, to, an, auspice, he, had, received, the, emperor, believed, that, his, death, would, be, at, midday, as, a, result, he, was, always, restless, around, that, time, on, the, day, of, the, assassination, domitian, was, distressed, and, repeatedly, asked, a, servant, to, tell, him, what, time, it, was, the, servant, who, was, himself, one, of, the, plotters, lied, to, the, emperor, telling, him, that, it, was, already, late, in, the, afternoon, apparently, put, at, ease, the, emperor, went, to, his, desk, to, sign, some, decrees, stephanus, who, had, been, feigning, an, injury, to, his, arm, for, several, days, and, wearing, a, bandage, to, allow, him, to, carry, a, concealed, dagger, suddenly, appeared, he, pretended, that, he, had, discovered, a, plot, and, was, for, that, reason, granted, an, audience, whereupon, as, the, amazed, domitian, perused, a, document, he, had, handed, him, stephanus, stabbed, him, in, the, groin, the, wounded, emperor, put, up, a, fight, but, succumbed, to, seven, further, stabs, his, assailants, being, a, subaltern, named, clodianus, parthenius, s, freedman, maximus, satur, a, head, chamberlain, and, one, of, the, imperial, gladiators, during, the, attack, stephanus, and, domitian, had, struggled, on, the, floor, during, which, time, stephanus, was, stabbed, by, the, emperor, and, died, shortly, afterward, domitian, s, body, was, carried, away, on, a, common, bier, and, unceremoniously, cremated, by, his, nurse, phyllis, later, she, took, the, emperor, s, ashes, to, the, flavian, temple, and, mingled, them, with, those, of, his, niece, julia, he, was, 44, years, old, as, had, been, foretold, his, death, came, at, midday, cassius, dio, writing, nearly, a, hundred, years, later, suggests, that, the, assassination, was, improvised, while, suetonius, implies, it, was, a, well, organized, conspiracy, citing, stephanus, feigned, injury, and, claiming, that, the, doors, to, the, servants, quarters, had, been, locked, prior, to, the, attack, and, that, a, sword, domitian, kept, concealed, beneath, his, pillow, as, a, last, line, of, personal, protection, against, a, would, be, assassin, had, also, been, removed, beforehand, dio, included, domitia, longina, among, the, conspirators, but, in, light, of, her, attested, devotion, to, domitian, even, years, after, her, husband, had, died, her, involvement, in, the, plot, seems, highly, unlikely, the, precise, involvement, of, the, praetorian, guard, is, unclear, one, of, the, guard, s, commanders, titus, petronius, secundus, was, almost, certainly, aware, of, the, plot, the, other, titus, flavius, norbanus, the, former, governor, of, raetia, was, a, member, of, domitian, s, family, the, fasti, ostienses, the, ostian, calendar, records, that, on, the, same, day, as, domitian, s, assassination, the, senate, proclaimed, marcus, cocceius, nerva, emperor, despite, his, political, experience, this, was, a, remarkable, choice, nerva, was, old, and, childless, and, had, spent, much, of, his, career, out, of, the, public, light, prompting, both, ancient, and, modern, authors, to, speculate, on, his, involvement, in, domitian, s, assassination, according, to, cassius, dio, the, conspirators, approached, nerva, as, a, potential, successor, prior, to, the, assassination, suggesting, that, he, was, at, least, aware, of, the, plot, he, does, not, appear, in, suetonius, version, of, the, events, but, this, may, be, understandable, since, his, works, were, published, under, nerva, s, direct, descendants, trajan, and, hadrian, to, suggest, the, dynasty, owed, its, accession, to, murder, would, have, been, less, than, sensitive, on, the, other, hand, nerva, lacked, widespread, support, in, the, empire, and, as, a, known, flavian, loyalist, his, track, record, would, not, have, recommended, him, to, the, conspirators, the, precise, facts, have, been, obscured, by, history, but, modern, historians, believe, nerva, was, proclaimed, emperor, solely, on, the, initiative, of, the, senate, within, hours, after, the, news, of, the, assassination, broke, the, decision, may, have, been, hasty, so, as, to, avoid, civil, war, but, neither, appears, to, have, been, involved, in, the, conspiracy, the, senate, nonetheless, rejoiced, at, the, death, of, domitian, and, immediately, following, nerva, s, accession, as, emperor, passed, damnatio, memoriae, on, domitian, s, memory, his, coins, and, statues, were, melted, his, arches, were, torn, down, and, his, name, was, erased, from, all, public, records, domitian, and, over, a, century, later, publius, septimius, geta, were, the, only, emperors, known, to, have, officially, received, a, damnatio, memoriae, though, others, may, have, received, de, facto, ones, in, many, instances, existing, portraits, of, domitian, such, as, those, found, on, the, cancelleria, reliefs, were, simply, recarved, to, fit, the, likeness, of, nerva, which, allowed, quick, production, of, new, images, and, recycling, of, previous, material, yet, the, order, of, the, senate, was, only, partially, executed, in, rome, and, wholly, disregarded, in, most, of, the, provinces, outside, italy, according, to, suetonius, the, people, of, rome, met, the, news, of, domitian, s, death, with, indifference, but, the, army, was, much, grieved, calling, for, his, deification, immediately, after, the, assassination, and, in, several, provinces, rioting, as, a, compensation, measure, the, praetorian, guard, demanded, the, execution, of, domitian, s, assassins, which, nerva, refused, instead, he, merely, dismissed, titus, petronius, secundus, and, replaced, him, with, a, former, commander, casperius, aelianus, dissatisfaction, with, this, state, of, affairs, continued, to, loom, over, nerva, s, reign, and, ultimately, erupted, into, a, crisis, in, october, 97, when, members, of, the, praetorian, guard, led, by, casperius, aelianus, laid, siege, to, the, imperial, palace, and, took, nerva, hostage, he, was, forced, to, submit, to, their, demands, agreeing, to, hand, over, those, responsible, for, domitian, s, death, and, even, giving, a, speech, thanking, the, rebellious, praetorians, titus, petronius, secundus, and, parthenius, were, sought, out, and, killed, nerva, was, unharmed, in, this, assault, but, his, authority, was, damaged, beyond, repair, shortly, thereafter, he, announced, the, adoption, of, trajan, as, his, successor, and, with, this, decision, nearly, abdicated, the, classic, view, of, domitian, is, usually, negative, since, most, of, the, antique, sources, were, related, to, the, senatorial, or, aristocratic, class, with, which, domitian, had, notoriously, difficult, relations, furthermore, contemporary, historians, such, as, pliny, the, younger, tacitus, and, suetonius, all, wrote, after, his, reign, when, his, memory, had, been, condemned, to, oblivion, by, the, senate, the, work, of, domitian, s, court, poets, martial, and, statius, constitutes, virtually, the, only, literary, evidence, concurrent, with, his, reign, perhaps, as, unsurprising, as, the, attitude, of, post, domitianic, historians, the, poems, of, martial, and, statius, are, highly, adulatory, praising, domitian, s, achievements, as, equalling, those, of, the, gods, the, most, extensive, account, of, the, life, of, domitian, to, survive, was, written, by, the, historian, suetonius, who, was, born, during, the, reign, of, vespasian, and, published, his, works, under, emperor, hadrian, 117, 138, his, de, vita, caesarum, is, the, source, of, much, of, what, is, known, of, domitian, although, his, text, is, predominantly, negative, it, neither, exclusively, condemns, nor, praises, domitian, and, asserts, that, his, rule, started, well, but, gradually, declined, into, terror, the, biography, is, problematic, however, in, that, it, appears, to, contradict, itself, with, regards, to, domitian, s, rule, and, personality, at, the, same, time, presenting, him, as, a, conscientious, moderate, man, and, as, a, decadent, libertine, according, to, suetonius, domitian, wholly, feigned, his, interest, in, arts, and, literature, and, never, bothered, to, acquaint, himself, with, classic, authors, other, passages, alluding, to, domitian, s, love, of, epigrammatic, expression, suggest, that, he, was, in, fact, familiar, with, classic, writers, while, he, also, patronized, poets, and, architects, founded, artistic, olympics, and, personally, restored, the, library, of, rome, at, great, expense, after, it, had, burned, down, de, vita, caesarum, is, also, the, source, of, several, outrageous, stories, regarding, domitian, s, married, life, according, to, suetonius, domitia, longina, was, exiled, in, 83, because, of, an, affair, with, a, famous, actor, named, paris, when, domitian, found, out, he, allegedly, murdered, paris, in, the, street, and, promptly, divorced, his, wife, with, suetonius, further, adding, that, once, domitia, was, exiled, domitian, took, julia, as, his, mistress, who, later, died, during, a, failed, abortion, modern, historians, consider, this, highly, implausible, however, noting, that, malicious, rumours, such, as, those, concerning, domitia, s, alleged, infidelity, were, eagerly, repeated, by, post, domitianic, authors, and, used, to, highlight, the, hypocrisy, of, a, ruler, publicly, preaching, a, return, to, augustan, morals, while, privately, indulging, in, excesses, and, presiding, over, a, corrupt, court, nevertheless, the, account, of, suetonius, has, dominated, imperial, historiography, for, centuries, although, tacitus, is, usually, considered, to, be, the, most, reliable, author, of, this, era, his, views, on, domitian, are, complicated, by, the, fact, that, his, father, in, law, gnaeus, julius, agricola, may, have, been, a, personal, enemy, of, the, emperor, in, his, biographical, work, agricola, tacitus, maintains, that, agricola, was, forced, into, retirement, because, his, triumph, over, the, caledonians, highlighted, domitian, s, own, inadequacy, as, a, military, commander, several, modern, authors, such, as, dorey, have, argued, the, opposite, that, agricola, was, in, fact, a, close, friend, of, domitian, and, that, tacitus, merely, sought, to, distance, his, family, from, the, fallen, dynasty, once, nerva, was, in, power, tacitus, major, historical, works, including, the, histories, and, agricola, s, biography, were, all, written, and, published, under, domitian, s, successors, nerva, 96, 98, and, trajan, 98, 117, unfortunately, the, part, of, tacitus, histories, dealing, with, the, reign, of, the, flavian, dynasty, is, almost, entirely, lost, his, views, on, domitian, survive, through, brief, comments, in, its, first, five, books, and, the, short, but, highly, negative, characterization, in, agricola, in, which, he, severely, criticizes, domitian, s, military, endeavours, nevertheless, tacitus, admits, his, debt, to, the, flavians, with, regard, to, his, own, public, career, other, influential, 2nd, century, authors, include, juvenal, and, pliny, the, younger, the, latter, of, whom, was, a, friend, of, tacitus, and, in, 100, delivered, his, famous, panegyricus, traiani, before, trajan, and, the, roman, senate, exalting, the, new, era, of, restored, freedom, while, condemning, domitian, as, a, tyrant, juvenal, savagely, satirized, the, domitianic, court, in, his, satires, depicting, the, emperor, and, his, entourage, as, corrupt, violent, and, unjust, as, a, consequence, the, anti, domitianic, tradition, was, already, well, established, by, the, end, of, the, 2nd, century, and, by, the, 3rd, century, even, expanded, upon, by, early, church, historians, who, identified, domitian, as, an, early, persecutor, of, christians, such, as, in, the, acts, of, john, over, the, course, of, the, 20th, century, domitian, s, military, administrative, and, economic, policies, were, re, evaluated, hostile, views, of, domitian, had, been, propagated, until, archeological, and, numismatic, advances, brought, renewed, attention, to, his, reign, and, necessitated, a, revision, of, the, literary, tradition, established, by, tacitus, and, pliny, it, would, be, nearly, a, hundred, years, after, st, phane, gsell, s, 1894, essai, sur, le, r, gne, de, l, empereur, domitien, however, before, any, new, book, length, studies, were, published, the, first, of, these, was, jones, 1992, the, emperor, domitian, he, concludes, that, domitian, was, a, ruthless, but, efficient, autocrat, for, the, majority, of, his, reign, there, was, no, widespread, dissatisfaction, with, his, policies, his, harshness, was, limited, to, a, highly, vocal, minority, who, exaggerated, his, despotism, in, favor, of, the, nervan, antonian, dynasty, that, followed, his, foreign, policy, was, realistic, rejecting, expansionist, warfare, and, negotiating, peace, at, a, time, when, roman, military, tradition, dictated, aggressive, conquest, persecution, of, religious, minorities, such, as, jews, and, christians, was, non, existent, in, 1930, ronald, syme, argued, for, a, complete, reassessment, of, domitian, s, financial, policy, which, had, been, largely, viewed, as, a, disaster, his, economic, program, which, was, rigorously, efficient, maintained, the, roman, currency, at, a, standard, it, would, never, again, achieve, domitian, s, government, nonetheless, exhibited, totalitarian, characteristics, as, emperor, he, saw, himself, as, the, new, augustus, an, enlightened, despot, destined, to, guide, the, roman, empire, into, a, new, era, of, flavian, renaissance, using, religious, military, and, cultural, propaganda, he, fostered, a, cult, of, personality, he, deified, three, of, his, family, members, and, erected, massive, structures, to, commemorate, the, flavian, achievements, elaborate, triumphs, were, celebrated, in, order, to, boost, his, image, as, a, warrior, emperor, but, many, of, these, were, either, unearned, or, premature, by, nominating, himself, perpetual, censor, he, sought, to, control, public, and, private, morals, he, started, several, major, construction, projects, in, rome, including, the, aqua, traiana, and, the, baths, of, trajan, he, became, personally, involved, in, all, branches, of, the, government, and, successfully, prosecuted, corruption, among, public, officials, the, dark, side, of, his, censorial, power, involved, a, restriction, in, freedom, of, speech, and, an, increasingly, oppressive, attitude, toward, the, roman, senate, he, punished, libel, with, exile, or, death, and, due, to, his, suspicious, nature, increasingly, accepted, information, from, informers, to, bring, false, charges, of, treason, if, necessary, despite, his, vilification, by, contemporary, historians, domitian, s, administration, provided, the, foundation, for, the, principate, of, the, peaceful, 2nd, century, his, successors, nerva, and, trajan, were, less, restrictive, but, in, reality, their, policies, differed, little, from, his, much, more, than, a, gloomy, coda, to, the, 1st, century, the, roman, empire, prospered, between, 81, and, 96, in, a, reign, that, theodor, mommsen, described, as, a, somber, but, intelligent, despotism
