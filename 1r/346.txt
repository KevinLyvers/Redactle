realistic, traditions, of, classic, russian, literature, bunin, made, everybody, uncomfortable, having, got, this, severe, and, sharp, eye, for, real, art, feeling, acutely, the, power, of, a, word, he, was, full, of, hatred, towards, every, kind, of, artistic, excess, in, times, when, quoting, andrey, bely, throwing, pineapples, to, the, sky, was, the, order, of, the, day, bunin, s, very, presence, made, words, stick, in, people, s, throats, boris, zaitsev, later, remembered, he, met, anton, chekov, in, 1896, and, a, strong, friendship, ensued, the, collections, poems, and, stories,

october, 1900, issue, of, zhizn, life, magazine, it, was, welcomed, by, both, critics, and, colleagues, among, them, alexander, ertel, alexander, blok, and, aleksandr, kuprin, who, praised, its, rare, subtlety, even, though, the, book, testifies, to, his, association, with, the, symbolists, primarily, valery, bryusov, at, the, time, many, saw, it, as, an, antidote, to, the, pretentiousness, of, decadent, poetry, which, was, then, popular, in, russia, falling, leaves, was, definitely, pushkin, like, full, of, inner, poise, sophistication, clarity, and, wholesomeness, according, to, critic, korney, chukovsky, soon, after, the, book, s, release, gorky, called, bunin, in, a, letter, to, valery, bryusov, the, first, poet, of, our, times, it, was, for, falling, leaves, along, with, the, translation, of, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, s, the, song, of, hiawatha, 1898, that, bunin, was, awarded, his, first, pushkin, prize, bunin, justified, a, pause, of, two, years, in, the, early, 1900s, by, the, need, for, inner, growth, and, spiritual, change, at, the, turn, of, the, century, bunin, made, a, major, switch, from, poetry, to, prose, which, started, to, change, both, in, form, and, texture, becoming, richer, in, lexicon, more, compact, and, perfectly, poised, citing, gustave, flaubert, whose, work, he, admired, as, an, influence, bunin, was, demonstrating, that, prose, could, be, driven, by, poetic, rhythms, but, still, remain, prose, according, to, the, writer, s, nephew, pusheshnikov, bunin, once, told, him, apparently, i, was, born, a, versemaker, like, turgenev, who, was, a, versemaker, first, and, foremost, finding, the, true, rhythm, of, the, story, was, for, him, the, main, thing, everything, else, was, supplementary, and, for, me, the, crucial, thing, is, to, find, the, proper, rhythm, once, it, s, there, everything, else, comes, in, spontaneously, and, i, know, when, the, story, is, done, in, 1900, the, novella, antonov, apples, was, published, later, it, was, included, in, textbooks, and, is, regarded, as, bunin, s, first, real, masterpiece, but, it, was, criticised, at, the, time, as, too, nostalgic, and, elitist, allegedly, idealising, the, russian, nobleman, s, past, other, acclaimed, novellas, of, this, period, on, the, farm, the, news, from, home, and, to, the, edge, of, the, world, showing, a, penchant, for, extreme, precision, of, language, delicate, description, of, nature, and, detailed, psychological, analysis, made, him, a, popular, and, well, respected, young, author, in, 1902, znanie, started, publishing, the, complete,

the, writer, for, he, saw, them, as, little, more, than, the, russian, common, people, s, craving, for, anarchy, and, destruction, in, november, 1906, bunin, s, passionate, affair, with, vera, muromtseva, began, the, girl, s, family, was, unimpressed, with, bunin, s, position, as, a, writer, but, the, couple, defied, social, convention, moving, in, together, and, in, april, 1907, leaving, russia, for, an, extended, tour, through, egypt, and, palestine, the, bird, s, shadow, 1907, 1911, collection, published, as, a, separate, book, in, 1931, in, paris, came, as, a, result, of, this, voyage, these, travelling, sketches, were, to, change, the, critics, assessment, of, bunin, s, work, before, them, bunin, was, mostly, regarded, as, using, his, own, words, a, melancholy, lyricist, singing, hymns, to, noblemen, s, estates, and, idylls, of, the, past, in, the, late, 1900s, critics, started, to, pay, more, notice, to, the, colourfulness, and, dynamics, of, his, poetry, and, prose, in, terms, of, artistic, precision, he, has, no, equal, among, russian, poets, vestnik, evropy, wrote, at, the, time, bunin, attributed, much, importance, to, his, travels, counting, himself, among, that, special, type, of, people, who, tend, to, feel, strongest, for, alien, times, and, cultures, rather, than, those, of, their, own, and, admitting, to, being, drawn, to, all, the, necropolises, of, the, world, besides, foreign, voyages, had, admittedly, an, eye, opening, effect, on, the, writer, helping, him, to, see, russian, reality, more, objectively, in, the, early, 1910s, bunin, produced, several, famous, novellas, which, came, as, a, direct, result, of, this, change, in, perspective, in, october, 1909, bunin, received, his, second, pushkin, prize, for, poems, 1903, 1906, and, translations, of, lord, byron, s, cain, and, parts, of, longfellow, s, the, golden, legend, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, russian, academy, the, same, year, in, bunin, the, academy, crowns, not, a, daring, innovator, not, an, adventurous, searcher, but, arguably, the, last, gifted, pupil, of, talented, teachers, who, s, kept, and, preserved, all, the, most, beautiful, testaments, of, their, school, wrote, critic, aleksander, izmailov, formulating, the, conventional, view, of, the, time, it, was, much, later, that, bunin, was, proclaimed, one, of, the, most, innovative, russian, writers, of, the, century, in, 1910, bunin, published, the, village, a, bleak, portrayal, of, russian, country, life, which, he, depicted, as, full, of, stupidity, brutality, and, violence, this, book, caused, controversy, and, made, him, famous, its, harsh, realism, with, characters, having, sunk, so, far, below, the, average, level, of, intelligence, as, to, be, scarcely, human, prompted, maxim, gorky, to, call, bunin, the, best, russian, writer, of, the, day, i, ve, left, behind, my, narodnicism, which, didn, t, last, very, long, my, tolstoyism, too, and, now, i, m, closer, to, the, social, democrats, but, i, still, stay, away, from, political, parties, bunin, wrote, in, the, early, 1910s, he, said, he, realised, now, that, the, working, class, had, become, a, force, powerful, enough, to, overcome, the, whole, of, western, europe, but, warned, against, the, possible, negative, effect, of, the, russian, workers, lack, of, organisation, the, one, thing, that, made, them, different, from, their, western, counterparts, he, criticised, the, russian, intelligentsia, for, being, ignorant, of, the, common, people, s, life, and, spoke, of, a, tragic, schism, between,

france, to, whom, i, likewise, owe, an, eternal, debt, of, gratitude, but, gentlemen, of, the, academy, let, me, say, that, irrespective, of, my, person, and, my, work, your, choice, in, itself, is, a, gesture, of, great, beauty, it, is, necessary, that, there, should, be, centers, of, absolute, independence, in, the, world, no, doubt, all, differences, of, opinion, of, philosophical, and, religious, creeds, are, represented, around, this, table, but, we, are, united, by, one, truth, the, freedom, of, thought, and, conscience, to, this, freedom, we, owe, civilization, for, us, writers, especially, freedom, is, a, dogma, and, an, axiom, your, choice, gentlemen, of, the, academy, has, proved, once, more, that, in, sweden, the, love, of, liberty, is, truly, a, national, cult, in,

there, as, an, imperialist, intrigue, dealing, with, the, prize, bunin, donated, 100, 000, francs, to, a, literary, charity, fund, but, the, process, of, money, distribution, caused, controversy, among, his, fellow, russian, migr, writers, it, was, during, this, time, that, bunin, s, relationship, deteriorated, with, zinaida, gippius, and, dmitry, merezhkovsky, a, fellow, nobel, prize, nominee, who, once, suggested, that, they, divide, the, prize, between, the, two, should, one, of, them, get, it, and, had, been, refused, although, reluctant, to, become, involved, in, politics, bunin, was, now, feted, as, both, a, writer, and, the, embodiment, of, non, bolshevik, russian, values, and, traditions, his, travels, throughout, europe, featured, prominently, on, the, front, pages, of, the, russian, emigre, press, for, the, remainder, of, the, decade, in, 1933, he, allowed, calligrapher, guido, colucci, to, create, a, unique, manuscript, of, un, crime, a, french, translation, of, one, of, his, novellas, illustrated, with, three, original, gouaches, by, nicolas, poliakoff, in, 1934, 1936, the, complete, bunin, in, 11, volumes, was, published, in, berlin, by, petropolis, bunin, cited, this, edition, as, the, most, credible, one, and, warned, his, future, publishers, against, using, any, other, versions, of, his, work, rather, than, those, featured, in, the, petropolis, collection, 1936, was, marred, by, an, incident, in, lindau, on, the, swiss, german, border, when, bunin, having, completed, his, european, voyage, was, stopped, and, unceremoniously, searched, the, writer, who, caught, cold, and, fell, ill, after, the, night, spent, under, arrest, responded, by, writing, a, letter, to, the, paris, based, latest, news, newspaper, the, incident, caused, disbelief, and, outrage, in, france, in, 1937, bunin, finished, his, book, the, liberation, of, tolstoy, held, in, the, highest, regard, by, leo, tolstoy, scholars, in, 1938, bunin, began, working, on, what, would, later, become, a, celebrated, cycle, of, nostalgic, stories, with, a, strong, erotic, undercurrent, and, a, proustian, ring, the, first, eleven, stories, of, it, came, out, as, dark, avenues, or, dark, alleys, in, new, york, 1943, the, cycle, appeared, in, a, full, version, in, 1946, in, france, these, stories, assumed, a, more, abstract, and, metaphysical, tone, which, has, been, identified, with, his, need, to, find, refuge, from, the, nightmarish, reality, of, nazi, occupation, bunin, s, prose, became, more, introspective, which, was, attributed, to, the, fact, that, a, russian, is, surrounded, by, enormous, broad, and, lasting, things, the, steppes, the, sky, in, the, west, everything, is, cramped, and, enclosed, and, this, automatically, produces, a, turning, towards, the, self, inwards, as, world, war, ii, broke, out, bunin, s, friends, in, new, york, anxious, to, help, the, nobel, prize, laureate, get, out, of, france, issued, officially, endorsed, invitations, for, him, to, travel, to, the, us, and, in, 1941, they, received, their, nansen, passports, enabling, them, to, make, the, trip, but, the, couple, chose, to, remain, in, grasse,

vegetables, and, greens, helping, one, another, out, at, a, time, when, according, to, zurov, grasse, s, population, had, eaten, all, of, their, cats, and, dogs, a, journalist, who, visited, the, villa, in, 1942, described, bunin, as, a, skinny, and, emaciated, man, looking, like, an, ancient, patrician, for, bunin, though, this, isolation, was, a, blessing, and, he, refused, to, re, locate, to, paris, where, conditions, might, have, been, better, it, takes, 30, minutes, of, climbing, to, reach, our, villa, but, there, s, not, another, view, in, the, whole, world, like, the, one, that, s,

staunch, anti, nazi, referring, to, adolf, hitler, and, benito, mussolini, as, rabid, monkeys, he, risked, his, life, sheltering, fugitives, including, jews, such, as, the, pianist, a, liebermann, and, his, wife, in, his, house, in, grasse, after, vichy, was, occupied, by, the, germans, according, to, zurov, bunin, invited, some, of, the, soviet, war, prisoners, straight, from, gatchina, who, worked, in, occupied, grasse, to, his, home, in, the, mountains, when, the, heavily, guarded, german, forces, headquarters, were, only, 300, metres, 980, ft, away, from, his, home, the, atmosphere, in, the, neighbourhood, though, was, not, that, deadly, judging, by, the, bunin, s, diary, entry, for, 1, august, 1944, nearby, there, were, two, guards, there, were, also, one, german, and, one,

account, of, his, meeting, with, an, elderly, writer, who, looked, as, sprightly, and, lively, as, if, he, had, never, had, to, come, through, those, five, years, of, voluntary, exile, according, to, bunin, s, friend, n, roshchin, the, liberation, of, france, was, a, cause, of, great, celebration, and, exultation, for, bunin, once, in, the, audience, at, a, soviet, russian, theatre, show, in, paris, bunin, found, himself, sitting, next, to, a, young, red, army, colonel, as, the, latter, rose, and, bowed, saying, do, i, have, the, honour, of, sitting, next, to, ivan, alekseyevich, bunin, the, writer, sprang, to, his, feet, i, have, the, even, higher, honour, of, sitting, next, to, an, officer, of, the, great, red, army, he, passionately, retorted, on, 19, june, 1945, bunin, held, a,

celebrated, in, the, parisian, russian, community, bunin, started, to, communicate, closely, with, the, soviet, connoisseurs, journalist, yuri, zhukov, and, literary, agent, boris, mikhailov, the, latter, receiving, from, the, writer, several, new, stories, for, proposed, publishing, in, the, ussr, rumours, started, circulating, that, the, soviet, version, of, the, complete, bunin, was, already, in, the, works, in, the, late, 1940s, bunin, having, become, interested, in, the, new, soviet, literature, in, particular, the, works, of, aleksandr, tvardovsky, and, konstantin, paustovsky, entertained, plans, of, returning, to, the, soviet, union, as, aleksandr, kuprin, had, done, in, the, 1930s, in, 1946, speaking, to, his, communist, counterparts, in, paris, bunin, praised, the, supreme, soviet, s, decision, to, return, soviet, citizenship, to, russian, exiles, in, france, still, stopping, short, of, saying, yes, to, the, continuous, urging, from, the, soviet, side, for, him, to, return, it, is, hard, for, an, old, man, to, go, back, to, places, where, he, s, pranced, goat, like, in, better, times, friends, and, relatives, are, all, buried, that, for, me, would, be, a, graveyard, trip, he, reportedly, said, to, zhukov, promising, though, to, think, more, of, it, financial, difficulties, and, the, french, reading, public, s, relative, indifference, to, the, publication, of, dark, avenues, figured, high, among, his, motives, would, you, mind, asking, the, union, of, writers, to, send, me, at, least, some, of, the, money, for, books, that, ve, been, published, and, re, issued, in, moscow, in, the, 1920s, and, 1930s, i, am, weak, i, am, short, of, breath, i, need, to, go, to, the, south, but, am, too, skinny, to, even, dream, of, it, bunin, wrote, to, nikolay, teleshov, in, a, 19, november, 1946, letter, negotiations, for, the, writer, s, return, came, to, an, end, after, the, publication, of, his, memoirs, 1950, full, of, scathing, criticism, of, soviet, cultural, life, apparently, aware, of, his, own, negativism, bunin, wrote, i, was, born, too, late, if, i, had, been, born, earlier, my, literary, memoirs, would, have, been, different, i, wouldn, t, have, been, a, witness, to, 1905, the, first, world, war, then, 1917, and, what, followed, lenin, stalin, hitler, how, can, i, not, be, jealous, of, our, forefather, noah, he, lived, through, only, one, flood, in, his, lifetime, reportedly, the, infamous, zhdanov, decree, was, one, of, the, reasons, for, bunin, s, change, of, mind, on, 15, september, 1947, bunin, wrote, to, mark, aldanov, i, have, a, letter, here, from, teleshov, written, on, 7, september, what, a, pity, he, writes, that, you, ve, missed, all, of, this, how, your, book, was, set, up, how, everybody, was, waiting, for, you, here, in, the, place, where, you, could, have, been, rich, feasted, and, held, in, such, high, honour, having, read, this, i, spent, an, hour, hair, tearing, then, i, suddenly, became, calm, it, just, came, to, me, all, of, a, sudden, all, those, other, things, zhdanov, and, fadeev, might, have, given, me, instead, of, feasts, riches, and, laurels, after, 1948, his, health, deteriorating, bunin, concentrated, upon, writing, memoirs, and, a, book, on, anton, chekhov, he, was, aided, by, his, wife, who, along, with, zurov, completed, the, work, after, bunin, s, death, and, saw, to, its, publication, in, new, york, in, 1955, in, english, translation, it, was, entitled, about, chekhov, the, unfinished, symphony, bunin, also, revised, a, number, of, stories, for, publication, in, new, collections, spent, considerable, time, looking, through, his, papers, and, annotated, his, collected, works, for, a, definitive, edition, in, 1951, bunin, was, elected, the, first, ever, hononary, international, pen, member, representing, the, community, of, writers, in, exile, according, to, a, j, heywood, one, major, event, of, bunin, s, last, years, was, his, quarrel, in, 1948, with, maria, tsetlina, and, boris, zaitsev, following, the, decision, by, the, union, of, russian, writers, and, journalists, in, france, to, expel, holders, of, soviet, passports, from, its, membership, bunin, responded, by, resigning, from, the, union, the, writer, s, last, years, were, marred, by, bitterness, disillusionment, and, ill, health, he, was, suffering, from, asthma, bronchitis, and, chronic, pneumonia, on, 2, may, 1953, bunin, left, in, his, diary, a, note, that, proved, to, be, his, last, one, still, this, is, so, dumbfoundingly, extraordinary, in, a, very, short, while, there, will, be, no, more, of, me, and, of, all, the, things, worldly, of, all, the, affairs, and, destinies, from, then, on, i, will, be, unaware, and, what, i, m, left, to, do, here, is, dumbly, try, to, consciously, impose, upon, myself, fear, and, amazement, he, wrote, ivan, alekseyevich, bunin, died, in, a, paris, attic, flat, in, the, early, hours, of, 8, november, 1953, heart, failure, cardiac, asthma, and, pulmonary, sclerosis, were, cited, as, the, causes, of, death, a, lavish, burial, service, took, place, at, the, russian, church, on, rue, daru, all, the, major, newspapers, both, russian, and, french, published, large, obituaries, for, quite, a, while, the, coffin, was, held, in, a, vault, on, 30, january, 1954, bunin, was, buried, in, the, sainte, genevi, ve, des, bois, russian, cemetery, in, the, 1950s, bunin, became, the, first, of, the, russian, writers, in, exile, to, be, published, officially, in, the, ussr, in, 1965, the, complete, bunin, came, out, in, moscow, in, nine, volumes, some, of, his, more, controversial, books, notably, cursed, days, remained, banned, in, the, soviet, union, until, the, late, 1980s, ivan, bunin, made, history, as, the, first, russian, writer, to, receive, the, nobel, prize, for, literature, the, immediate, basis, for, the, award, was, the, autobiographical, novel, the, life, of, arseniev, but, bunin, s, legacy, is, much, wider, in, scope, he, is, regarded, as, a, master, of, the, short, story, described, by, scholar, oleg, mikhaylov, as, an, archaist, innovator, who, while, remaining, true, to, the, literary, tradition, of, the, 19th, century, made, huge, leaps, in, terms, of, artistic, expression, and, purity, of, style, style, heralds, an, historical, precedent, technical, precision, as, an, instrument, of, bringing, out, beauty, is, sharpened, to, the, extreme, there, s, hardly, another, poet, who, on, dozens, of, pages, would, fail, to, produce, a, single, epithet, analogy, or, metaphor, the, ability, to, perform, such, a, simplification, of, poetic, language, without, doing, any, harm, to, it, is, the, sign, of, a, true, artist, when, it, comes, to, artistic, precision, bunin, has, no, rivals, among, russian, poets, wrote, vestnik, evropy, bunin, s, early, stories, were, of, uneven, quality, they, were, united, in, their, earthiness, lack, of, plot, and, signs, of, a, curious, longing, for, life, s, farthest, horizons, young, bunin, started, his, career, by, trying, to, approach, the, ancient, dilemmas, of, the, human, being, and, his, first, characters, were, typically, old, men, his, early, prose, works, had, one, common, leitmotif, that, of, nature, s, beauty, and, wisdom, bitterly, contrasting, with, humanity, s, ugly, shallowness, as, he, progressed, bunin, started, to, receive, encouraging, reviews, anton, chekhov, warmly, greeted, his, first, stories, even, if, he, found, too, much, density, in, them, but, it, was, gorky, who, gave, bunin, s, prose, its, highest, praise, till, the, end, of, his, life, gorky, long, after, the, relationship, between, former, friends, had, soured, rated, bunin, among, russian, literature, s, greatest, writers, and, recommended, his, prose, for, younger, generations, of, writers, as, an, example, of, true, and, unwithering, classicism, as, a, poet, bunin, started, out, as, a, follower, of, ivan, nikitin, and, aleksey, koltsov, then, gravitated, towards, the, yakov, polonsky, and, afanasy, fet, school, the, latter, s, impressionism, becoming, a, marked, influence, the, theme, of, bunin, s, early, works, seemed, to, be, the, demise, of, the, traditional, russian, nobleman, of, the, past, something, which, as, an, artist, he, simultaneously, gravitated, toward, and, felt, averted, from, in, the, 1900s, this, gave, way, to, a, more, introspective, philosophical, style, akin, to, fyodor, tyutchev, and, his, poetic, cosmology, all, the, while, bunin, remained, hostile, to, modernism, and, the, darker, side, of, it, decadence, mikhaylov, saw, him, as, the, torch, bearer, of, aleksander, pushkin, s, tradition, of, praising, the, naked, simplicity, s, charms, the, symbolist, s, flights, of, imagination, and, grotesque, passions, foreign, to, him, bunin, made, nature, his, field, of, artistic, research, and, here, carved, his, art, to, perfection, few, people, are, capable, of, loving, nature, as, bunin, does, and, it, s, this, love, that, makes, his, scope, wide, his, vision, deep, his, colour, and, aural, impressions, so, rich, wrote, aleksander, blok, a, poet, from, a, literary, camp, bunin, treated, as, hostile, it, was, for, his, books, of, poetry, the, most, notable, of, which, is, falling, leaves, 1901, and, his, poetic, translations, that, bunin, became, a, three, time, pushkin, prize, laureate, his, verse, was, praised, by, aleksander, kuprin, while, blok, regarded, bunin, as, among, the, first, in, the, hierarchy, of, russian, poets, one, great, admirer, of, bunin, s, verse, was, vladimir, nabokov, who, even, if, making, scornful, remarks, about, bunin, s, prose, compared, him, to, blok, some, see, bunin, as, a, direct, follower, of, gogol, who, was, the, first, in, russian, literature, to, discover, the, art, of, fusing, poetry, and, prose, together, the, wholesomeness, of, bunin, s, character, allowed, him, to, avoid, crises, to, become, virtually, the, only, author, of, the, first, decades, of, the, 20th, century, to, develop, gradually, and, logically, bunin, is, the, only, one, who, remains, true, to, himself, gorky, wrote, in, a, letter, to, chirikov, in, 1907, yet, an, outsider, to, all, the, contemporary, trends, and, literary, movements, bunin, was, never, truly, famous, in, russia, becoming, an, academician, in, 1909, alienated, him, even, more, from, the, critics, the, majority, of, whom, saw, the, academy, s, decision, to, expel, gorky, several, years, earlier, as, a, disgrace, the, closest, bunin, came, to, fame, was, in, 1911, 1912, when, the, village, and, dry, valley, came, out, the, former, according, to, the, author, sketched, with, sharp, cruelty, the, most, striking, lines, of, the, russian, soul, its, light, and, dark, sides, and, its, often, tragic, foundations, it, caused, passionate, and, occasionally, very, hostile, reactions, nobody, has, ever, drawn, the, village, in, such, a, deep, historical, context, before, maxim, gorky, wrote, after, this, uncompromising, book, it, became, impossible, to, continue, to, paint, the, russian, peasantry, life, in, the, idealised, narodnik, style, way, bunin, single, handedly, closed, this, long, chapter, in, russian, literature, he, maintained, the, truly, classic, traditions, of, realism, in, russian, literature, at, the, very, time, when, they, were, in, the, gravest, danger, under, attack, by, modernists, and, decadents, yet, he, was, far, from, traditional, in, many, ways, introducing, to, russian, literature, a, completely, new, set, of, characters, and, a, quite, novel, laconic, way, of, saying, things, dry, valley, was, regarded, as, another, huge, step, forward, for, bunin, while, the, village, dealt, metaphorically, with, russia, as, a, whole, in, a, historical, context, here, according, to, the, author, the, russian, soul, in, the, attempt, to, highlight, the, slavic, psyche, s, most, prominent, features, it, s, one, of, the, greatest, books, of, russian, horror, and, there, s, an, element, of, liturgy, in, it, like, a, young, priest, with, his, faith, destroyed, bunin, buried, the, whole, of, his, class, wrote, gorky, bunin, s, travel, sketches, were, lauded, as, innovative, notably, bird, s, shadow, 1907, 1911, he, s, enchanted, with, the, east, with, the, light, bearing, lands, he, now, describes, in, such, beautiful, fashion, for, the, east, both, biblical, and, modern, bunin, chooses, the, appropriate, style, solemn, and, incandescent, full, of, imagery, bathing, in, waves, of, sultry, sunlight, and, adorned, with, arabesques, and, precious, stones, so, that, when, he, tells, of, these, grey, haired, ancient, times, disappearing, in, the, distant, haze, of, religion, and, myth, the, impression, he, achieves, is, that, of, watching, a, great, chariot, of, human, history, moving, before, our, eyes, wrote, yuri, aykhenvald, critics, noted, bunin, s, uncanny, knack, of, immersing, himself, into, alien, cultures, both, old, and, new, best, demonstrated, in, his, eastern, cycle, of, short, stories, as, well, as, his, superb, translation, of, henry, wadsworth, longfellow, s, the, song, of, hiawatha, 1898, bunin, was, greatly, interested, in, international, myths, and, folklore, as, well, as, the, russian, folkloric, tradition, but, according, to, georgy, adamovich, he, was, absolutely, intolerant, towards, those, of, his, colleagues, who, employed, stylizations, the, style, russe, manufacturers, his, cruel, and, rightly, so, review, of, sergey, gorodetsky, s, poetry, was, one, example, even, blok, s, kulikovo, field, for, me, an, outstanding, piece, irritated, him, as, too, lavishly, adorned, that, s, vasnetsov, he, commented, meaning, masquerade, and, opera, but, he, treated, things, that, he, felt, were, not, masqueradery, differently, of, the, slovo, o, polku, igoreve, he, said, something, to, the, effect, that, all, the, poets, of, the, whole, world, lumped, together, couldn, t, have, created, such, wonder, in, fact, something, close, to, pushkin, s, words, yet, translations, of, the, legend, outraged, him, particularly, that, of, balmont, he, despised, shmelyov, for, his, pseudo, russian, pretenses, though, admitting, his, literary, gift, bunin, had, an, extraordinarily, sharp, ear, for, falseness, he, instantly, recognized, this, jarring, note, and, was, infuriated, that, was, why, he, loved, tolstoy, so, much, once, i, remember, he, spoke, of, tolstoy, as, the, one, who, s, never, said, a, single, word, that, would, be, an, exaggeration, bunin, has, often, been, spoken, of, as, a, cold, writer, some, of, his, conceptual, poems, of, the, 1910s, refuted, this, stereotype, tackling, philosophical, issues, like, the, mission, of, an, artist, insensory, 1916, where, he, showed, fiery, passion, according, to, oleg, mikhaylov, bunin, wanted, to, maintain, distance, between, himself, and, his, reader, being, frightened, by, any, closeness, but, his, pride, never, excluded, passions, just, served, as, a, panzer, it, was, like, a, flaming, torch, in, an, icy, shell, on, a, more, personal, level, vera, muromtseva, confirmed, sure, he, wanted, to, come, across, as, and, he, succeeded, by, being, a, first, class, actor, people, who, didn, t, know, him, well, enough, couldn, t, begin, to, imagine, what, depths, of, soft, tenderness, his, soul, was, capable, of, reaching, she, wrote, in, her, memoirs, the, best, of, bunin, s, prose, the, gentleman, from, san, francisco, loopy, ears, and, notably, brothers, based, on, ceylon, s, religious, myth, had, a, strong, philosophical, streak, to, it, in, terms, of, ethics, bunin, was, under, the, strong, influence, of, socrates, as, related, by, xenophon, and, plato, he, argued, that, it, was, the, greek, classic, who, first, expounded, many, things, that, were, later, found, in, hindu, and, jewish, sacred, books, bunin, was, particularly, impressed, with, socrates, s, ideas, on, the, intrinsic, value, of, human, individuality, it, being, a, kind, of, focus, for, higher, forces, quoted, from, bunin, s, short, story, back, to, rome, as, a, purveyor, of, socratic, ideals, bunin, followed, leo, tolstoy, the, latter, s, observation, about, beauty, being, the, crown, of, virtue, was, bunin, s, idea, too, critics, found, deep, philosophical, motives, and, deep, undercurrents, in, mitya, s, love, and, the, life, of, arseniev, two, pieces, in, which, bunin, came, closest, to, a, deep, metaphysical, understanding, of, the, human, being, s, tragic, essence, konstantin, paustovsky, called, the, life, of, arseniev, one, of, the, most, outstanding, phenomena, of, world, literature, in, his, view, on, russia, and, its, history, bunin, for, a, while, had, much, in, common, with, a, k, tolstoy, of, whom, he, spoke, with, great, respect, both, tended, to, idealise, the, pre, tatar, rus, years, later, he, greatly, modified, his, view, of, russian, history, forming, a, more, negative, outlook, there, are, two, streaks, in, our, people, one, dominated, by, rus, another, by, chudh, and, merya, both, have, in, them, a, frightening, instability, sway, as, russian, people, say, of, themselves, we, are, like, wood, both, club, and, icon, may, come, of, it, depending, on, who, is, working, on, this, wood, bunin, wrote, years, later, in, emigration, bunin, continued, his, experiments, with, extremely, concise, ultra, ionized, prose, taking, chekhov, and, tolstoy, s, ideas, on, expressive, economy, to, the, last, extreme, the, result, of, this, was, god, s, tree, a, collection, of, stories, so, short, some, of, them, were, half, a, page, long, professor, pyotr, bitsilly, thought, god, s, tree, to, be, the, most, perfect, of, bunin, s, works, and, the, most, exemplary, nowhere, else, can, such, eloquent, laconism, can, be, found, such, definitive, and, exquisite, writing, such, freedom, of, expression, and, really, magnificent, demonstration, of, over, matter, no, other, book, of, his, has, in, it, such, a, wealth, of, material, for, understanding, of, bunin, s, basic, method, a, method, in, which, in, fact, there, was, nothing, but, basics, this, simple, but, precious, quality, honesty, bordering, on, hatred, of, any, pretense, is, what, makes, bunin, so, closely, related, to, pushkin, tolstoy, and, chekhov, bitsilli, wrote, influential, even, if, controversial, was, his, cursed, days, 1918, 1920, diary, of, which, scholar, thomas, gaiton, marullo, wrote, the, work, is, important, for, several, reasons, cursed, days, is, one, of, the, very, few, anti, bolshevik, diaries, to, be, preserved, from, the, time, of, the, russian, revolution, and, civil, war, it, recreates, events, with, graphic, and, gripping, immediacy, unlike, the, works, of, early, soviets, and, emigres, and, their, self, censoring, backdrop, of, memory, myth, and, political, expediency, bunin, s, truth, reads, almost, like, an, aberration, cursed, days, also, links, russian, anti, utopian, writing, of, the, nineteenth, century, to, its, counterpart, in, the, twentieth, reminiscent, of, the, fiction, of, dostoevsky, it, features, an, underground, man, who, does, not, wish, to, be, an, organ, stop, or, to, affirm, crystal, palaces, bunin, s, diary, foreshadowed, such, libelous, memoirs, as, yevgenia, ginzburg, s, journey, into, the, whirlwind, 1967, and, within, the, whirlwind, and, nadezhda, mandelstam, s, hope, against, hope, 1970, and, hope, abandoned, 1974, the, accounts, of, two, courageous, women, caught, up, in, the, stalinist, terror, of, the, 1930s, cursed, days, also, preceded, the, rebellious, anti, soviet, tradition, that, began, with, evgeny, zamyatin, and, yury, olesha, moved, on, to, mikhail, bulgakov, and, reached, a, climax, with, boris, pasternak, and, alexander, solzhenitsyn, one, can, argue, that, in, its, painful, exposing, of, political, and, social, utopias, cursed, days, heralded, the, anti, utopian, writing, of, george, orwell, and, aldous, huxley, bunin, and, zamyatin, had, correctly, understood, that, the, soviet, experiment, was, destined, to, self, destruct, despite, his, works, being, virtually, banned, in, the, soviet, union, up, until, the, mid, 1950s, bunin, exerted, a, strong, influence, over, several, generations, of, soviet, writers, among, those, who, owed, a, lot, to, bunin, critics, mentioned, mikhail, sholokhov, konstantin, fedin, konstantin, paustovsky, ivan, sokolov, mikitov, and, later, yuri, kazakov, vasily, belov, and, viktor, likhonosov, ivan, bunin, s, books, have, been, translated, into, many, languages, and, the, world, s, leading, writers, praised, his, gift, romain, rolland, called, bunin, an, artistic, genius, he, was, spoken, and, written, of, in, much, the, same, vein, by, writers, like, henri, de, r, gnier, thomas, mann, rainer, maria, rilke, jerome, k, jerome, and, jaros, aw, iwaszkiewicz, in, 1950, on, the, eve, of, his, 80th, birthday, fran, ois, mauriac, expressed, in, a, letter, his, delight, and, admiration, but, also, his, deep, sympathy, to, bunin, s, personal, qualities, and, the, dignified, way, he, d, got, through, all, the, tremendous, difficulties, life, had, thrown, at, him, in, a, letter, published, by, figaro, andr, gide, greeted, bunin, on, behalf, of, all, france, calling, him, the, great, artist, and, adding, i, don, t, know, of, any, other, writer, who, s, so, to, the, point, in, expressing, human, feelings, simple, and, yet, always, so, fresh, and, new, european, critics, often, compared, bunin, to, both, tolstoy, and, dostoyevsky, crediting, him, with, having, renovated, the, russian, realist, tradition, both, in, essence, and, in, form, on, 22, october, 2020, google, celebrated, his, 150th, birthday, with, a, google, doodle, bunin, s, first, love, was, varvara, pashchenko, his, classmate, in, yelets, daughter, of, a, doctor, and, an, actress, whom, he, fell, for, in, 1889, and, then, went, on, to, work, with, in, oryol, in, 1892, their, relationship, was, difficult, in, many, ways, the, girl, s, father, detested, the, union, because, of, bunin, s, impecunious, circumstances, varvara, herself, was, not, sure, if, she, wanted, to, marry, and, bunin, too, was, uncertain, whether, marriage, was, really, appropriate, for, him, the, couple, moved, to, poltava, and, settled, in, yuly, bunin, s, home, but, by, 1892, their, relations, deteriorated, pashchenko, complaining, in, a, letter, to, yuly, bunin, that, serious, quarrels, were, frequent, and, begging, for, assistance, in, bringing, their, union, to, an, end, the, affair, eventually, ended, in, 1894, with, her, marrying, actor, and, writer, a, n, bibikov, ivan, bunin, s, close, friend, bunin, felt, betrayed, and, for, a, time, his, family, feared, the, possibility, of, him, committing, suicide, according, to, some, sources, it, was, varvara, pashchenko, who, many, years, later, would, appear, under, the, name, of, lika, in, the, life, of, arseniev, chapter, v, of, the, book, entitled, lika, was, also, published, as, a, short, story, scholar, tatyana, alexandrova, though, questioned, this, identification, suggesting, mirra, lokhvitskaya, might, have, been, the, major, prototype, while, vera, muromtseva, thought, of, lika, as, a, collective, character, aggregating, the, writer, s, reminiscences, of, several, women, he, knew, in, his, youth, in, the, summer, of, 1898, while, staying, with, writer, a, m, fedorov, bunin, became, acquainted, with, n, p, tsakni, a, greek, social, democrat, activist, the, publisher, and, editor, of, the, odessa, newspaper, yuzhnoe, obozrenie, southern, review, invited, to, contribute, to, the, paper, bunin, became, virtually, a, daily, visitor, to, the, tsakni, family, dacha, and, fell, in, love, with, the, latter, s, 18, year, old, daughter, anna, 1879, 1963, on, 23, september, 1898, the, two, married, but, by, 1899, signs, of, alienation, between, them, were, obvious, at, the, time, of, their, acrimonious, separation, in, march, 1900, anna, was, pregnant, she, gave, birth, to, a, son, nikolai, in, odessa, on, 30, august, of, the, same, year, the, boy, of, whom, his, father, saw, very, little, died, on, 16, january, 1905, from, a, combination, of, scarlet, fever, measles, and, heart, complications, ivan, bunin, s, second, wife, was, vera, muromtseva, 1881, 1961, niece, of, the, high, ranking, politician, sergey, muromtsev, the, two, had, initially, been, introduced, to, each, other, by, writer, ekaterina, lopatina, some, years, earlier, but, it, was, their, encounter, at, the, house, of, the, writer, boris, zaitsev, in, november, 1906, which, led, to, an, intense, relationship, which, resulted, in, the, couple, becoming, inseparable, until, bunin, s, death, bunin, and, muromtseva, married, officially, only, in, 1922, after, he, managed, at, last, to, divorce, tsakni, legally, decades, later, vera, muromtseva, bunina, became, famous, in, her, own, right, with, her, book, life, of, bunin, in, 1927, while, in, grasse, bunin, fell, for, the, russian, poet, galina, kuznetsova, on, vacation, there, with, her, husband, the, latter, outraged, by, the, well, publicized, affair, stormed, off, while, bunin, not, only, managed, to, somehow, convince, vera, muromtseva, that, his, love, for, galina, was, purely, platonic, but, also, invite, the, latter, to, stay, in, the, house, as, a, secretary, and, a, family, member, the, situation, was, complicated, by, the, fact, that, leonid, zurov, who, stayed, with, the, bunins, as, a, guest, for, many, years, was, secretly, in, love, with, vera, of, which, her, husband, was, aware, this, made, it, more, of, a, love, quadrilateral, than, a, mere, triangle, bunin, and, kuznetsova, s, affair, ended, dramatically, in, 1942, when, the, latter, now, deeply, in, love, with, another, frequent, guest, opera, singer, margo, stepun, sister, of, fyodor, stepun, left, bunin, who, felt, disgraced, and, insulted, the, writer, s, tempestuous, private, life, in, emigration, became, the, subject, of, the, internationally, acclaimed, russian, movie, his, wife, s, diary, or, the, diary, of, his, wife, 2000, which, caused, controversy, and, was, described, by, some, as, masterful, and, thought, provoking, but, by, others, as, vulgar, inaccurate, and, in, bad, taste, vera, muromtseva, bunina, later, accepted, both, kuznetsova, and, margarita, stepun, as, friends, nashi, ours, as, she, called, them, lived, with, the, bunins, for, long, periods, during, the, second, world, war, according, to, a, j, heywood, of, leeds, university, in, germany, and, then, new, york, after, the, war, kuznetsova, and,
