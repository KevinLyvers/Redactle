ended, in, austrian, defeat, and, the, loss, of, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, to, france, after, another, french, victory, in, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, napoleon, crowned, himself, emperor, of, the, french, in, response, francis, assumed, the, title, of, emperor, of, austria, he, continued, his, leading, role, as, napoleon, s, adversary, in, the, napoleonic, wars, and, suffered, successive, defeats, that, greatly, weakened, austria, as, a, european, power, in, 1806, after, napoleon, created, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, francis, abdicated, as, holy, roman, emperor, which, in, effect, marked, the, dissolution, of, the, holy, roman, empire, following, the, defeat, of, the, fifth, coalition, francis, ceded, more, territory, to, france, and, was, forced, to, wed, his, daughter, marie, louise, to, napoleon, in, 1813, francis, turned, against, napoleon, and, finally, defeated, him, in, the, war, of, the, sixth, coalition, forcing, the, french, emperor, to, abdicate, austria, took, part, as, a, leading, member, of, the, holy, alliance, at, the, congress, of, vienna, which, was, largely, dominated, by, francis, chancellor, klemens, von, metternich, culminating, in, a, new, european, order, and, the, restoration, of, most, of, francis, ancient, dominions, due, to, the, establishment, of, the, concert, of, europe, which, resisted, popular, nationalist, and, liberal, tendencies, francis, was, viewed, as, a, reactionary, later, in, his, reign, francis, died, in, 1835, at, the, age, of, 67, and, was, succeeded, by, his, son, ferdinand, i, francis, was, a, son, of, emperor, leopold, ii, 1747, 1792, and, his, wife, maria, luisa, of, spain, 1745, 1792, daughter, of, charles, iii, of, spain, francis, was, born, in, florence, the, capital, of, tuscany, where, his, father, reigned, as, grand, duke, from, 1765, to, 1790, though, he, had, a, happy, childhood, surrounded, by, his, many, siblings, his, family, knew, francis, was, likely, to, be, a, future, emperor, his, uncle, joseph, had, no, surviving, issue, from, either, of, his, two, marriages, and, so, in, 1784, the, young, archduke, was, sent, to, the, imperial, court, in, vienna, to, educate, and, prepare, him, for, his, future, role, emperor, joseph, ii, himself, took, charge, of, francis, development, his, disciplinarian, regime, was, a, stark, contrast, to, the, indulgent, florentine, court, of, leopold, the, emperor, wrote, that, francis, was, stunted, in, growth, backward, in, bodily, dexterity, and, deportment, and, neither, more, nor, less, than, a, spoiled, mother, s, child, joseph, concluded, that, the, manner, in, which, he, was, treated, for, upwards, of, sixteen, years, could, not, but, have, confirmed, him, in, the, delusion, that, the, preservation, of, his, own, person, was, the, only, thing, of, importance, joseph, s, martinet, method, of, improving, the, young, francis, was, fear, and, unpleasantness, the, young, archduke, was, isolated, the, reasoning, being, that, this, would, make, him, more, self, sufficient, as, it, was, felt, by, joseph, that, francis, failed, to, lead, himself, to, do, his, own, thinking, nonetheless, francis, greatly, admired, his, uncle, if, rather, in, fear, of, him, to, complete, his, training, francis, was, sent, to, join, an, army, regiment, in, hungary, and, he, settled, easily, into, the, routine, of, military, life, he, was, present, at, the, siege, of, belgrade, which, occurred, during, the, austro, turkish, war, after, the, death, of, joseph, ii, in, 1790, francis, father, became, emperor, he, had, an, early, taste, of, power, while, acting, as, leopold, s, deputy, in, vienna, while, the, incoming, emperor, traversed, the, empire, attempting, to, win, back, those, alienated, by, his, brother, s, policies, the, strain, took, a, toll, on, leopold, and, by, the, winter, of, 1791, he, became, ill, he, gradually, worsened, throughout, early, 1792, on, the, afternoon, of, 1, march, leopold, died, at, the, relatively, young, age, of, 44, francis, just, past, his, 24th, birthday, was, now, emperor, much, sooner, than, he, had, expected, as, the, head, of, the, holy, roman, empire, and, the, ruler, of, the, vast, multi, ethnic, habsburg, hereditary, lands, francis, felt, threatened, by, the, french, revolutionaries, and, later, napoleon, s, expansionism, as, well, as, their, social, and, political, reforms, which, were, being, exported, throughout, europe, in, the, wake, of, the, conquering, french, armies, francis, had, a, fraught, relationship, with, france, his, aunt, marie, antoinette, the, wife, of, louis, xvi, and, queen, consort, of, france, was, guillotined, by, the, revolutionaries, in, 1793, at, the, beginning, of, his, reign, although, on, the, whole, he, was, indifferent, to, her, fate, later, he, led, the, holy, roman, empire, into, the, french, revolutionary, wars, he, briefly, commanded, the, allied, forces, during, the, flanders, campaign, of, 1794, before, handing, over, command, to, his, brother, archduke, charles, he, was, later, defeated, by, napoleon, by, the, treaty, of, campo, formio, he, ceded, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, to, france, in, exchange, for, venice, and, dalmatia, he, again, fought, against, france, during, the, war, of, the, second, coalition, on, 11, august, 1804, in, response, to, napoleon, crowning, himself, as, emperor, of, the, french, earlier, that, year, he, announced, that, he, would, henceforth, assume, the, title, of, hereditary, emperor, of, austria, as, francis, i, a, move, that, technically, was, illegal, in, terms, of, imperial, law, yet, napoleon, had, agreed, beforehand, and, therefore, it, happened, during, the, war, of, the, third, coalition, the, austrian, forces, met, a, crushing, defeat, at, austerlitz, and, francis, had, to, agree, to, the, treaty, of, pressburg, which, greatly, weakened, austria, and, brought, about, the, final, collapse, of, the, holy, roman, empire, in, july, 1806, under, massive, pressure, from, france, bavaria, and, fifteen, other, german, states, ratified, the, statutes, founding, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, with, napoleon, designated, protector, and, they, announced, to, the, imperial, diet, their, intention, to, leave, the, empire, with, immediate, effect, then, on, 22, july, napoleon, issued, an, ultimatum, to, francis, demanding, that, he, abdicate, as, holy, roman, emperor, by, 10, august, five, days, later, francis, bowed, to, the, inevitable, and, without, mentioning, the, ultimatum, affirmed, that, since, the, peace, of, pressburg, he, had, tried, his, best, to, fulfil, his, duties, as, emperor, but, that, circumstances, had, convinced, him, that, he, could, no, longer, rule, according, to, his, oath, of, office, the, formation, of, the, confederation, of, the, rhine, making, that, impossible, he, added, that, we, hereby, decree, that, we, regard, the, bond, which, until, now, tied, us, to, the, states, of, the, empire, as, dissolved, in, effect, dissolving, the, empire, at, the, same, time, he, declared, the, complete, and, formal, withdrawal, of, his, hereditary, lands, from, imperial, jurisdiction, after, that, date, he, reigned, as, francis, i, emperor, of, austria, in, 1809, francis, deeming, another, war, with, france, as, inevitable, and, influenced, by, hawks, in, vienna, attacked, france, again, hoping, to, take, advantage, of, the, peninsular, war, embroiling, napoleon, in, spain, he, was, again, defeated, and, this, time, forced, to, ally, himself, with, napoleon, ceding, territory, to, the, empire, joining, the, continental, system, and, wedding, his, daughter, marie, louise, to, the, emperor, the, napoleonic, wars, drastically, weakened, austria, making, it, entirely, landlocked, and, threatened, its, preeminence, among, the, states, of, germany, a, position, that, it, would, eventually, cede, to, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, 1813, for, the, fifth, and, final, time, austria, turned, against, france, and, joined, great, britain, russia, prussia, and, sweden, in, their, war, against, napoleon, austria, played, a, major, role, in, the, final, defeat, of, france, in, recognition, of, this, francis, represented, by, clemens, von, metternich, presided, over, the, congress, of, vienna, helping, to, form, the, concert, of, europe, and, the, holy, alliance, ushering, in, an, era, of, conservatism, in, europe, the, german, confederation, a, loose, association, of, central, european, states, was, created, by, the, congress, of, vienna, in, 1815, to, organize, the, surviving, states, of, the, holy, roman, empire, the, congress, was, a, personal, triumph, for, francis, who, hosted, the, assorted, dignitaries, in, comfort, though, francis, undermined, his, allies, tsar, alexander, and, frederick, william, iii, of, prussia, by, negotiating, a, secret, treaty, with, the, restored, french, king, louis, xviii, the, violent, events, of, the, french, revolution, impressed, themselves, deeply, into, the, mind, of, francis, as, well, as, all, other, european, monarchs, and, he, came, to, distrust, radicalism, in, any, form, in, 1794, a, jacobin, conspiracy, was, discovered, in, the, austrian, and, hungarian, armies, the, leaders, were, put, on, trial, but, the, verdicts, only, skirted, the, perimeter, of, the, conspiracy, francis, brother, alexander, leopold, at, that, time, palatine, of, hungary, wrote, to, the, emperor, admitting, although, we, have, caught, a, lot, of, the, culprits, we, have, not, really, got, to, the, bottom, of, this, business, yet, nonetheless, two, officers, heavily, implicated, in, the, conspiracy, were, hanged, and, gibbeted, while, numerous, others, were, sentenced, to, imprisonment, many, of, whom, died, from, the, conditions, francis, was, from, his, experiences, suspicious, and, set, up, an, extensive, network, of, police, spies, and, censors, to, monitor, dissent, in, this, he, was, following, his, father, s, lead, as, the, grand, duchy, of, tuscany, had, the, most, effective, secret, police, in, europe, even, his, family, did, not, escape, attention, his, brothers, the, archdukes, charles, and, johann, had, their, meetings, and, activities, spied, upon, censorship, was, also, prevalent, the, author, franz, grillparzer, a, habsburg, patriot, had, one, play, suppressed, solely, as, a, precautionary, measure, when, grillparzer, met, the, censor, responsible, he, asked, him, what, was, objectionable, about, the, work, the, censor, replied, oh, nothing, at, all, but, i, thought, to, myself, one, can, never, tell, in, military, affairs, francis, had, allowed, his, brother, the, archduke, charles, extensive, control, over, the, army, during, the, napoleonic, wars, yet, distrustful, of, allowing, any, individual, too, much, power, he, otherwise, maintained, the, separation, of, command, functions, between, the, hofkriegsrat, and, his, field, commanders, in, the, later, years, of, his, reign, he, limited, military, spending, requiring, it, not, exceed, forty, million, florins, per, year, because, of, inflation, this, resulted, in, inadequate, funding, with, the, army, s, share, of, the, budget, shrinking, from, half, in, 1817, to, only, twenty, three, percent, in, 1830, francis, presented, himself, as, an, open, and, approachable, monarch, he, regularly, set, aside, two, mornings, each, week, to, meet, with, his, imperial, subjects, regardless, of, status, by, appointment, in, his, office, even, speaking, to, them, in, their, own, language, but, his, will, was, sovereign, in, 1804, he, had, no, compunction, about, announcing, that, through, his, authority, as, holy, roman, emperor, he, declared, he, was, now, emperor, of, austria, at, the, time, a, geographical, term, that, had, little, resonance, two, years, later, francis, personally, wound, up, the, moribund, holy, roman, empire, of, the, german, nation, both, actions, were, of, dubious, constitutional, legality, to, increase, patriotic, sentiment, during, the, war, with, france, the, anthem, gott, erhalte, franz, den, kaiser, was, composed, in, 1797, to, be, sung, as, the, kaiserhymne, to, music, by, joseph, haydn, the, lyrics, were, adapted, for, later, emperors, and, the, music, lives, on, as, the, german, national, anthem, deutschlandlied, on, 2, march, 1835, 43, years, and, a, day, after, his, father, s, death, francis, died, in, vienna, of, a, sudden, fever, aged, 67, in, the, presence, of, many, of, his, family, and, with, all, the, religious, comforts, his, funeral, was, magnificent, with, his, viennese, subjects, respectfully, filing, past, his, coffin, in, the, court, chapel, of, the, hofburg, palace, for, three, days, francis, was, interred, in, the, traditional, resting, place, of, habsburg, monarchs, the, imperial, crypt, in, vienna, s, neue, markt, square, he, is, buried, in, tomb, number, 57, surrounded, by, tombs, of, his, four, wives, francis, passed, on, a, main, point, in, the, political, testament, he, left, for, his, son, and, heir, ferdinand, to, preserve, unity, in, the, family, and, regard, it, as, one, of, the, highest, goods, in, many, portraits, particularly, those, painted, by, peter, fendi, he, was, portrayed, as, the, patriarch, of, a, loving, family, surrounded, by, his, children, and, grandchildren, francis, ii, married, four, times, from, his, first, wife, elisabeth, of, w, rttemberg, one, daughter, who, died, in, infancy, and, his, second, wife, maria, teresa,
