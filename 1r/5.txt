l, opinion, nationale, and, le, temps, wrote, she, carries, herself, well, and, pronounces, with, perfect, precision, that, is, all, that, can, be, said, about, her, at, the, moment, bernhardt, did, not, remain, long, with, the, com, die, fran, aise, she, played, henriette, in, moli, re, s, les, femmes, savantes, and, hippolyte, in, l, tourdi, and, the, title, role, in, scribe, s, val, rie, but,

forced, to, ask, bernhardt, to, leave, her, family, could, not, understand, her, departure, from, the, theater, it, was, inconceivable, to, them, that, anyone, would, walk, away, from, the, most,

immediately, caused, another, offstage, scandal, when, she, was, invited, to, recite, poetry, at, a, reception, at, the, tuileries, palace, hosted, by, napoleon, iii, and, the, empress, eugenie, along, with, other, actors, of, the, gymnase, she, chose, to, recite, two, romantic, poems, by, victor, hugo, unaware, that, hugo, was, a, bitter, critic, of, the, emperor, following, the, first, poem, the, emperor, and, empress, rose, and, walked, out, followed, by, the, court, and, the, other, guests, her, next, role, at, the, gymnase, as, a, foolish, russian, princess, was, entirely,

affair, with, him, other, accounts, say, that, they, met, in, paris, where, the, prince, came, often, to, attend, the, theater, the, affair, was, cut, short, when, she, learned, that, her, mother, had, had, a, heart, attack, she, returned, to, paris, where, she, found, that, her, mother, was, better, but, that, she, was, pregnant, from, her, affair, with, the, prince, she, did, not, notify, the, prince, her, mother, did, not, want, the, fatherless, child, born, under, her, roof, so, she, moved, to, a, small, apartment, on, rue, duphot, and, on, 22, december, 1864, the, 20, year, old,

prince, denied, any, responsibility, for, the, child, she, later, called, the, affair, her, abiding, wound, but, she, never, discussed, maurice, s, parentage, with, anyone, when, asked, who, his, father, was, she, sometimes, answered, i, could, never, make, up, my, mind, whether, his, father, was, gambetta, victor, hugo, or, general, boulanger, many, years, later, in, january, 1885, when, bernhardt, was, famous, the, prince, allegedly, came, to, paris, and, offered, to, formally, recognise, maurice, as, his, son, but, maurice, politely, declined, explaining, he, was, entirely, satisfied, to, be, the, son, of, sarah, bernhardt, while, the, story, is, in, character, for, maurice, note, that, the, prince, died, in, 1871, when, maurice, was, 6, to, support, herself, after, the,

sculptor, s, outfit, including, white, satin, blouse, and, white, silk, trousers, rodin, dismissed, her, sculptures, as, old, fashioned, tripe, and, she, was, attacked, in, the, press, for, pursuing, an, activity, inappropriate, for, an, actress, she, was, defended, by, mile, zola, who, wrote, how, droll, not, content, with, finding, her, thin, or, declaring, her, mad, they, want, to, regulate, her, daily, activities, let, a, law, be, passed, immediately, to, prevent, the, accumulation, of, talent, in, her, final, years, bernhardt, wrote, a, textbook, on, the, art, of, acting, she, wrote, whenever, she, had, time, usually, between, productions, and, when, she, was, on, vacation, at, belle, le, after, her, death, the, writer, marcel, berger, her, close, friend, found, the, unfinished, manuscript, among, her, belongings, in, her, house, on, boulevard, pereire, he, edited, the, book, and, it, was, published, as, l, art, du, th, tre, in, 1923, an, english, translation, was, published, in, 1925, she, paid, particular, attention, to, the, use, of, the, voice, the, instrument, the, most, necessary, to, the, dramatic, artist, it, was, the, element, she, wrote, which, connected, the, artist, with, the, audience, the, voice, must, have, all, the, harmonies, serious, plaintive, vibrant, and, metallic, for, a, voice, to, be, fully, complete, she, wrote, it, is, necessary, that, it, be, very, slightly, nasal, an, artist, who, has, a, dry, voice, can, never, touch, the, public, she, also, stressed, the, importance, for, artists, to, train, their, breathing, for, long, passages, she, suggested, that, an, actress, should, be, able, to, recite, the, following, passage, from, ph, dre, in, a, single, breath, she, noted, that, the, art, of, our, art, is, not, to, have, it, noticed, by, the, public, we, must, create, an, atmosphere, by, our, sincerity, so, that, public, gasping, distracted, should, not, regain, its, equilibrium, and, free, will, until, the, fall, of, the, curtain, that, which, is, called, the, work, in, our, art, should, only, be, the, search, for, the, truth, she, also, insisted, that, artists, should, express, their, emotions, clearly, without, words, using, their, eye, their, hand, the, position, of, the, chest, the, tilting, of, the, head, the, exterior, form, of, the, art, is, often, the, entire, art, at, least, it, is, that, which, strikes, the, audience, the, most, effectively, she, encouraged, actors, to, work, overexcite, your, emotional, expression, become, accustomed, to, varying, your, psychological, states, and, translating, them, the, diction, the, way, of, standing, the, look, the, gesture, are, predominant, in, the, development, of, the, career, of, an, artist, she, explained, why, she, liked, to, perform, male, roles, the, roles, of, men, are, in, general, more, intellectual, than, the, roles, of, women, only, the, role, of, ph, dre, gives, me, the, charm, of, digging, into, a, heart, that, is, truly, anguished, always, in, the, theatre, the, parts, played, by, the, men, are, the, best, parts, and, yet, theatre, is, the, sole, art, where, women, can, sometimes, be, superior, to, men, bernhardt, had, a, remarkable, ability, to, memorise, a, role, quickly, she, recounted, in, l, art, du, th, tre, that, i, only, have, to, read, a, role, two, or, three, times, and, i, know, it, completely, but, the, day, that, i, stop, playing, the, piece, the, role, escapes, me, entirely, my, memory, can, t, contain, several, parts, at, the, same, time, and, it, s, impossible, for, me, to, recite, off, hand, a, tirade, from, ph, dre, or, hamlet, and, yet, i, can, remember, the, smallest, events, from, my, childhood, she, also, suffered, particularly, early, in, her, career, bouts, of, memory, loss, and, stage, fright, once, she, was, seriously, ill, before, a, performance, of, l, etrang, re, at, the, gaiety, theatre, in, london, and, the, doctor, gave, her, a, dose, of, painkiller, either, opium, or, morphine, during, the, performance, she, went, on, stage, but, could, not, remember, what, she, was, supposed, to, say, she, turned, to, another, actress, and, announced, if, i, made, you, come, here, madame, it, is, because, i, wanted, to, instruct, you, in, what, i, want, done, i, have, thought, about, it, and, i, do, not, want, to, tell, you, today, then, walked, offstage, the, other, actors, astonished, quickly, improvised, an, ending, to, the, scene, after, a, brief, rest, her, memory, came, back, and, bernhardt, went, back, on, stage, and, completed, the, play, during, another, performance, on, her, world, tour, a, backstage, door, was, opened, during, a, performance, of, ph, dre, and, a, cold, wind, blew, across, the, stage, as, bernhardt, was, reciting, without, interrupting, her, speech, she, added, if, someone, doesn, t, close, that, door, i, will, catch, pneumonia, the, door, was, closed, and, no, one, in, the, audience, seemed, to, notice, the, addition, french, drama, critics, praised, bernhardt, s, performances, francisque, sarcey, an, influential, paris, critic, wrote, of, her, 1871, performance, in, marie, she, has, a, sovereign, grace, a, penetrating, charm, and, i, don, t, know, what, she, is, a, natural, and, an, incomparable, artist, reviewing, her, performance, of, ruy, blas, in, 1872, the, critic, th, odore, de, banville, wrote, that, bernhardt, declaimed, like, a, bluebird, sings, like, the, wind, sighs, like, the, water, murmurs, of, the, same, performance, sarcey, wrote, she, added, the, music, of, her, voice, to, the, music, of, the, verse, she, sang, yes, sang, with, her, melodious, voice, victor, hugo, was, a, fervent, admirer, of, bernhardt, praising, her, golden, voice, describing, her, performance, in, his, play, ruy, blas, in, 1872, he, wrote, in, his, carnets, it, is, the, first, time, this, play, has, really, been, played, she, is, better, than, an, actress, she, is, a, woman, she, is, adorable, she, is, better, than, beautiful, she, has, the, harmonious, movements, and, looks, of, irresistible, seduction, her, 1882, performance, of, f, dora, was, described, by, the, english, novelist, maurice, baring, a, secret, atmosphere, emanated, from, her, an, aroma, an, attraction, which, was, at, once, exotic, and, cerebral, she, literally, hypnotized, the, audience, and, played, with, such, tigerish, passion, and, feline, seduction, which, whether, it, be, good, or, bad, art, nobody, has, been, able, to, match, since, in, 1884, sigmund, freud, saw, bernhardt, perform, theodora, writing, i, cannot, say, much, for, the, play, but, this, sarah, how, she, played, from, the, moment, i, heard, her, first, lines, pronounced, in, her, vibrant, and, adorable, voice, i, had, the, feeling, i, had, known, her, for, years, none, of, the, lines, that, she, spoke, could, surprise, me, i, believed, immediately, everything, that, she, said, the, smallest, centimeter, of, this, character, was, alive, and, enchanted, you, and, then, there, was, the, manner, she, had, to, flatter, to, implore, to, embrace, her, incredible, positions, the, manner, in, which, she, keeps, silent, but, each, of, her, limbs, and, each, of, her, movements, play, the, role, for, her, strange, creature, it, is, easy, for, me, to, imagine, that, she, has, no, need, to, be, any, different, on, the, street, than, she, is, on, the, stage, she, also, had, her, critics, particularly, in, her, later, years, among, the, new, generation, of, playwrights, who, advocated, a, more, naturalistic, style, of, acting, george, bernard, shaw, wrote, of, the, childishly, egotistical, character, of, her, acting, which, is, not, the, art, of, making, you, think, more, highly, or, feel, more, deeply, but, the, art, of, making, you, admire, her, pity, her, champion, her, weep, with, her, laugh, at, her, jokes, follow, her, fortunes, breathlessly, and, applaud, her, wildly, when, the, curtain, falls, it, is, the, art, of, fooling, you, ivan, turgenev, wrote, all, she, has, is, a, marvelous, voice, the, rest, is, cold, false, and, affected, the, worst, kind, of, repulsive, chic, parisienne, russian, dramatist, anton, chekhov, then, a, young, medical, student, was, paying, for, his, studies, by, writing, reviews, for, a, moscow, newspaper, he, stated, that, we, are, far, from, admiring, the, talent, of, sarah, bernhardt, she, is, a, woman, who, is, very, intelligent, and, knows, how, to, produce, an, effect, who, has, immense, taste, who, understands, the, human, heart, but, she, wanted, too, much, to, astonish, and, overwhelm, her, audience, he, wrote, that, in, her, roles, enchantment, is, smothered, in, artifice, sarah, bernhardt, s, performances, were, seen, and, appraised, by, many, of, the, leading, literary, and, cultural, figures, of, the, late, 19th, century, mark, twain, wrote, there, are, five, kinds, of, actresses, bad, actresses, fair, actresses, good, actresses, great, actresses, and, then, there, is, sarah, bernhardt, oscar, wilde, called, her, the, incomparable, one, scattered, lilies, in, her, path, and, wrote, a, play, in, french, salom, especially, for, her, it, was, banned, by, british, censors, before, it, could, be, performed, shortly, before, he, died, wilde, wrote, the, three, women, i, have, most, admired, in, my, life, are, sarah, bernhardt, lily, langtry, and, queen, victoria, i, would, have, married, any, one, of, them, with, pleasure, after, seeing, a, performance, by, bernhardt, in, 1903, the, british, actress, ellen, terry, wrote, how, marvelous, sarah, bernhardt, was, she, had, the, transparence, of, an, azalea, with, even, more, delicacy, the, lightness, of, a, cloud, with, less, thickness, smoke, from, a, burning, paper, describes, her, more, nearly, british, author, d, h, lawrence, saw, bernhardt, perform, la, dame, aux, camelias, in, 1908, afterward, he, wrote, to, a, friend, sarah, was, wonderful, and, terrible, oh, to, see, her, and, to, hear, her, a, wild, creature, a, gazelle, with, a, beautiful, panther, s, fascination, and, fury, laughing, in, musical, french, screaming, with, true, panther, cry, sobbing, and, sighing, like, a, deer, sobs, wounded, to, the, death, she, is, not, pretty, her, voice, is, not, sweet, but, there, is, the, incarnation, of, wild, emotion, that, we, share, with, all, living, things, the, identity, of, bernhardt, s, father, is, not, known, for, certain, her, original, birth, certificate, was, destroyed, when, the, paris, commune, burned, the, hotel, de, ville, and, city, archives, in, may, 1871, in, her, autobiography, ma, double, vie, she, describes, meeting, her, father, several, times, and, writes, that, his, family, provided, funding, for, her, education, and, left, a, sum, of, 100, 000, francs, for, her, when, she, came, of, age, she, said, he, frequently, travelled, overseas, and, that, when, she, was, still, a, child, he, died, in, pisa, in,

recent, biography, by, h, l, ne, tierchant, 2009, suggests, her, father, may, have, been, a, young, man, named, de, morel, whose, family, members, were, notable, shipowners, and, merchants, in, le,
