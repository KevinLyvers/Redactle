pivotal, place, in, the, history, of, paper, due, to, his, addition, of, pulp, via, tree, bark, and, hemp, ends, which, resulted, in, the, large, scale, manufacture, and, worldwide, spread, of, paper, although, traditionally, regarded, as, the, inventor, of, paper, earlier, forms, of, paper, have, existed, since, the, 3rd, century, bce, so, cai, s, contributions, are, limited, to, innovation, rather, than, invention, born, in, guiyang, commandery, in, what, is, now, leiyang, cai, arrived, at, the, imperial, court, in, luoyang, by, 75, ce, where, he, served, as, a, chamberlain, for,

song, and, her, sister, who, then, killed, themselves, when, emperor, he, ascended, the, throne, in, 88, ce, dou, awarded, cai, with, two, positions, zhongchang, shi, a, political, counselor, to, the, emperor, that, was, the, highest, position, for, eunuchs, of, the, time, and, also, as, shangfang, ling, where, cai, oversaw, the, production, of, instruments, and, weapons, at, the, palace, workshop, despite, emperor, he, s, successful, coup, d, tat, against, the, dou, family, in, 92, ce, cai, was, undisturbed, by, his, former, ally, s, downfall, his, position, in, the, palace, workshop, increased, in, scope, he, became, responsible, for, the, production, of, ceremonial, weapons, which, the, hou, hanshu, reports, were, of, exemplary, craftsmanship, however, cai, s, most, noted, innovation, was, in, 105, ce, when, he, substantially, improved, the, papermaking, process, with, the, use, of, tree, bark, hemp, waste, old, rags, and, fishnets, his, new, type, of, paper, quickly, displaced, the, bamboo, and, wooden, slips, used, until, then, and, cai, received, wealth, and, fame, throughout, the, empire, in, 110, ce, lady, deng, who, had, become, the, empress, dowager, to, the, young, emperor, an, appointed, cai, to, oversee, 100, scholars, new, edition, of, the, five, classics, cai, was, rewarded, for, his, imperial, service, in, 114, ce, he, received, the, title, of, marquis, and, was, enfeoffed, lord, of, longting, a, small, village, when, his, ally, deng, died, in, 121, ce, cai, was, ordered, to, the, ministry, of, justice, because, of, his, involvement, in, the, death, of, the, emperor, s, grandmother, consort, song, ashamed, at, his, predicament, and, expecting, to, be, sentenced, to, death, he, committed, suicide, that, year, and, died, in, the, capital, city, in, which, he, had, spent, almost, his, entire, adult, life, cai, s, improvements, to, paper, making, are, considered, to, have, had, an, enormous, impact, on, human, history, and, of, those, who, created, china, s, four, great, inventions, the, compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and, printing, cai, is, the, only, inventor, whose, name, is, known, although, in, china, he, is, revered, in, ancestor, worship, deified, as, the, god, of, papermaking, and, appears, in, chinese, folklore, he, is, mostly, unknown, outside, of, east, asia, his, hometown, in, leiyang, remains, an, active, center, of, paper, production, the, main, source, of, information, on, cai, lun, is, just, 300, characters, in, volume, 78, of, the, hou, hanshu, book, of, the, later, han, an, official, history, compiled, by, the, liu, song, dynasty, historian, and, politician, fan, ye, tsien, tsuen, hsuin, a, modern, sinologist, noted, that, while, fan, s, account, is, the, most, comprehensive, it, is, problematic, as, it, was, written, nearly, 300, years, after, cai, s, death, the, primary, source, fan, used, was, the, 2nd, century, dongguan, hanji, history, of, the, eastern, han, in, which, yan, du, is, credited, as, the, author, of, cai, s, biography, yan, s, brief, 70, character, account, is, near, contemporary, but, only, survives, in, a, reconstructed, state, from, a, lost, original, another, older, source, is, a, brief, mention, by, the, 3rd, century, scholar, dong, ba, who, is, quoted, referencing, cai, s, papermaking, accomplishments, in, the, 10th, century, leishu, encyclopedia, taiping, yulan, readings, of, the, taiping, era, later, history, books, such, as, the, song, dynasty, s, shiwu, jiyuan, compound, source, of, matters, and, facts, also, include, cai, and, his, work, in, papermaking, however, some, major, history, books, such, as, the, annals, of, the, later, han, and, zizhi, tongjian, comprehensive, mirror, in, aid, of, governance, do, not, mention, cai, s, papermaking, achievements, sinologist, t, h, barrett, suggested, this, was, because, cai, lun, was, after, all, a, palace, eunuch, precisely, the, sort, of, person, normally, viewed, with, antagonism, by, the, regular, bureaucrats, who, controlled, the, writing, of, official, and, even, most, unofficial, history, cai, lun, was, born, in, guiyang, commandery, modern, day, leiyang, hunan, province, in, the, eastern, han, dynasty, 25, 220, ce, his, exact, year, of, birth, is, unknown, estimates, include, c, 50, c, 57, and, c, 62, other, than, being, born, into, a, poor, family, virtually, nothing, is, known, of, his, early, life, guiyang, was, a, southern, commandery, where, han, chinese, had, immigrated, for, hundreds, of, years, to, plant, and, cultivate, rice, legends, suggest, there, was, a, pool, near, his, home, south, of, which, was, a, stone, mortar, that, cai, would, later, use, for, papermaking, it, is, not, known, how, cai, came, to, be, in, the, service, of, the, imperial, court, in, luoyang, modern, day, luoyang, henan, province, which, was, distant, from, his, birthplace, the, hou, hanshu, reports, that, he, was, first, employed, during, the, end, of, the, yongping, era, 58, 75, of, emperor, ming, the, site, of, modern, guiyang, commandery, was, known, to, have, had, various, iron, mines, at, the, time, so, the, former, director, of, the, paper, museum, in, tokyo, kiyofusa, narita, suggested, that, through, the, assistance, of, some, who, were, in, charge, of, the, iron, foundry, he, found, opportunity, to, go, to, the, capital, city, narita, cited, cai, s, future, court, appointment, to, oversee, the, production, of, weapons, especially, swords, as, evidence, that, he, must, have, learned, the, skills, to, do, so, earlier, in, his, life, likely, from, the, iron, foundry, alternatively, if, there, is, any, truth, to, the, various, folktales, about, cai, his, supposed, habits, of, trickery, may, have, helped, him, receive, a, court, appointment, cai, is, known, to, have, been, a, eunuch, in, 75, ce, although, it, is, possible, he, was, employed, somewhat, earlier, in, the, yongping, era, sinologist, rafe, de, crespigny, suggested, this, was, in, the, early, 70s, in, the, han, dynasty, eunuchs, were, employed, in, imperial, service, and, were, the, only, people, eligible, for, certain, specialized, tasks, such, as, watching, over, the, imperial, harem, and, the, imperial, household, there, were, also, certain, promotions, available, exclusively, for, them, cai, s, position, was, probably, as, a, liaison, between, the, privy, council, and, the, emperor, and, likely, involved, duties, akin, to, a, chamberlain, for, the, imperial, family, narita, notes, cai, s, role, meant, he, would, have, had, many, chances, to, become, acquainted, with, the, most, powerful, people, in, the, empire, around, 80, ce, during, the, subsequent, jianchu, era, 76, 84, under, emperor, zhang, cai, was, promoted, to, a, xiao, huangmen, attendant, at, the, yellow, gates, the, positions, with, a, salary, rank, of, 600, shi, or, dan, involved, delivering, and, receiving, messages, between, the, imperial, palace, apartments, and, the, outside, court, since, 82, ce, liu, qing, zhang, s, son, from, his, concubine, consort, song, had, been, the, designated, heir, secured, by, the, favor, of, empress, ma, however, ma, s, death, in, 79, ce, made, lady, dou, the, empress, and, aiming, to, develop, her, family, s, power, she, adopted, prince, zhao, with, the, intention, of, installing, him, as, heir, as, a, result, when, song, became, ill, in, 82, and, asked, for, herbs, dou, falsely, accused, her, of, planning, to, use, the, herbs, for, witchcraft, against, zhang, dou, then, ordered, cai, to, interrogate, consort, song, and, her, sister, another, imperial, consort, to, force, a, confession, they, both, killed, themselves, believing, dou, s, accusation, zhang, replaced, liu, qing, with, prince, zhao, as, heir, prince, zhao, ruling, as, emperor, he, was, 10, years, old, at, his, accession, in, 88, ce, so, dou, took, control, as, empress, dowager, and, secured, her, authority, by, giving, various, positions, to, her, four, brothers, particularly, dou, xian, who, promoted, cai, to, zhongchang, shi, regular, attendant, for, his, loyalty, cai, served, as, a, private, counselor, to, he, in, political, matters, this, post, gave, cai, a, salary, rank, of, 2000, shi, and, was, the, highest, eunuch, exclusive, position, which, also, made, him, a, chief, eunuch, of, the, palace, in, the, hou, hanshu, cai, was, characterized, as, in, the, words, of, de, crespigny, honest, cautious, and, a, good, judge, of, policy, cai, was, also, designated, shangfang, ling, prefect, of, the, palace, workshop, or, prefect, of, the, masters, of, techniques, later, in, 88, or, 89, ce, while, in, this, eunuch, only, position, he, would, have, been, responsible, for, the, production, of, instruments, and, weapons, for, imperial, use, the, role, had, a, salary, rank, of, 600, shi, though, this, was, in, addition, to, the, 2000, shi, from, his, continued, zhongchang, shi, post, when, emperor, he, came, of, age, in, 92, ce, he, led, various, officials, especially, zheng, zhong, in, a, coup, d, tat, to, overthrow, the, dou, family, cai, was, not, involved, in, their, removal, and, though, he, was, previously, allied, with, the, family, he, was, undisturbed, by, the, emperor, s, coup, in, 97, ce, his, position, as, shangfang, ling, expanded, in, scope, as, he, became, responsible, for, ceremonial, swords, and, other, items, the, hou, hanshu, describes, his, craftsmanship, as, high, quality, and, a, model, for, later, generations, in, 105, cai, publicly, declared, that, he, had, invented, a, new, composition, for, paper, with, a, new, papermaking, process, writing, had, a, long, history, in, china, with, writing, surfaces, being, bamboo, and, wooden, slips, wood, for, short, text, and, bamboo, for, lengthy, text, these, media, were, inconvenient, as, they, were, awkward, to, store, heavy, and, difficult, to, write, on, after, meng, tian, purportedly, created, an, animal, hair, brush, for, writing, in, 3rd, century, bce, silk, and, cloth, became, alternatives, that, addressed, these, issues, but, they, were, too, expensive, for, widespread, use, the, absence, of, a, practical, solution, motivated, continued, experimentation, with, different, materials, cai, s, pulp, solution, proved, the, most, effective, his, process, still, used, bamboo, but, also, introduced, hemp, waste, old, rags, fishnets, and, most, importantly, bark, from, trees, likely, mulberry, the, materials, were, boiled, to, a, pulp, that, was, beaten, with, a, wood, or, stone, mallet, before, being, mixed, with, a, large, amount, of, water, the, resulting, mixture, was, then, processed, with, wooden, sieves, and, the, excess, water, removed, leaving, the, paper, finished, once, dry, the, paper, that, resulted, from, this, method, is, often, referred, to, as, cai, hou, paper, this, event, and, its, context, are, relayed, in, an, often, cited, passage, of, the, hou, hanshu, in, ancient, times, writings, and, inscriptions, were, generally, made, on, tablets, of, bamboo, or, on, pieces, of, silk, called, chih, but, silk, being, costly, and, bamboo, heavy, they, were, not, convenient, to, use, cai, lun, then, initiated, the, idea, of, making, paper, from, the, bark, of, trees, hemp, old, rags, and, fishing, nets, he, submitted, the, process, to, the, emperor, in, the, first, year, of, yuanxing, and, received, praise, for, his, ability, from, this, time, paper, has, been, in, use, everywhere, and, is, universally, called, the, paper, of, lord, cai, many, legends, about, the, inspiration, for, cai, s, invention, exist, one, of, the, most, popular, said, that, cai, was, inspired, by, watching, paper, wasps, make, their, nests, tsien, suggested, that, cai, was, inspired, by, the, people, of, his, birthplace, who, used, bark, from, mulberry, trees, to, create, cloth, as, a, writing, surface, irrespective, of, its, origin, in, 105, ce, cai, s, new, papermaking, process, both, impressed, he, and, earned, him, fame, throughout, the, empire, after, the, infant, emperor, shang, s, eight, month, reign, in, 106, ce, emperor, he, was, succeeded, by, 13, year, old, emperor, an, while, lady, deng, ruled, as, empress, dowager, both, cai, and, zheng, maintained, influence, in, deng, s, court, in, 110, ce, deng, assembled, more, than, 100, scholars, including, liu, zhen, liu, taotu, and, ma, rong, in, the, eastern, pavilion, of, the, palace, to, begin, creating, a, definitive, edition, of, the, five, classics, she, appointed, cai, to, oversee, and, supervise, the, production, de, crespigny, said, that, this, meant, cai, was, seriously, concerned, with, scholarship, in, 114, ce, he, was, awarded, the, title, of, marquis, and, the, imperial, court, enfeoffed, him, as, the, lord, of, longting, a, small, village, of, 300, families, in, modern, day, yang, county, shaanxi, later, that, year, zheng, died, and, cai, succeeded, him, as, the, head, of, the, dowager, s, household, an, assumed, power, after, deng, s, death, in, 121, ce, though, the, court, was, dominated, by, the, influence, of, empress, yan, ji, and, her, brothers, remembering, cai, s, part, in, the, death, of, his, grandmother, consort, song, an, ordered, cai, to, report, to, the, ministry, of, justice, to, answer, the, charges, and, presumably, sentence, him, to, death, ashamed, that, the, emperor, would, send, him, to, death, in, a, dishonorable, way, cai, bathed, and, dressed, in, formal, clothes, before, killing, himself, by, drinking, poison, due, to, modern, archeological, investigations, it, is, now, certain, that, different, forms, of, paper, existed, in, china, as, early, as, 3rd, century, bce, though, the, findings, do, not, necessarily, discount, the, credit, given, to, cai, the, chinese, scholar, tsien, tsuen, hsuin, explained, that, the, term, used, in, cai, s, ancient, biography, z, o, y, can, be, understood, as, to, initiate, the, idea, meaning, that, he, furthered, the, ongoing, process, with, the, addition, of, important, materials, additionally, cai, is, responsible, for, the, earliest, known, use, of, tree, bark, and, hemp, as, ingredients, for, paper, and, it, is, clear, that, paper, did, not, see, widespread, use, in, china, until, cai, s, improvements, as, such, scholars, have, revised, his, contributions, as, ones, that, furthered, an, ongoing, process, instead, of, a, sudden, discovery, however, due, to, the, pivotal, significance, of, his, improvements, and, the, resulting, spread, of, paper, use, throughout, china, cai, continues, to, be, traditionally, credited, with, inventing, paper, there, is, also, speculation, that, cai, was, the, patron, of, this, achievement, and, took, credit, from, someone, else, as, feng, dao, may, have, done, with, his, improvements, to, printing, cai, s, improvements, to, paper, and, the, papermaking, process, are, considered, especially, impactful, to, human, history, as, they, resulted, in, the, spread, of, literature, and, knowledge, around, the, world, and, advancements, in, communications, however, cai, is, only, somewhat, known, outside, east, asia, and, is, often, excluded, from, major, encyclopedias, the, scholar, of, paper, history, thomas, francis, carter, drew, parallels, between, cai, and, johannes, gutenberg, the, inventor, of, the, first, printing, press, which, was, movable, type, calling, them, spiritual, father, and, son, respectively, in, his, 1978, book, the, 100, a, ranking, of, the, most, influential, persons, in, history, michael, h, hart, ranked, him, 7th, above, figures, such, as, gutenberg, christopher, columbus, albert, einstein, and, charles, darwin, in, 2007, time, ranked, him, among, the, best, inventors, of, all, time, after, cai, s, efforts, in, 105, ce, a, renowned, paper, maker, who, may, have, been, an, apprentice, to, cai, variously, recorded, by, modern, sources, as, zuo, bo, tso, po, courtesy, name, tzu, i, ziyi, from, donglai, shandong, or, tso, tz, yi, improved, the, process, in, 150, ce, or, later, in, the, han, dynasty, other, than, this, the, basic, principles, of, cai, s, papermaking, process, have, changed, little, over, time, and, the, new, form, of, paper, spread, throughout, china, according, to, legend, the, buddhist, monk, damjing, brought, the, process, to, japan, though, this, is, unconfirmed, damjing, occupies, a, similar, patron, saint, position, in, japan, that, cai, does, in, china, by, the, 600s, the, process, appeared, in, turkestan, korea, and, india, while, chinese, prisoners, from, the, battle, of, talas, spread, the, knowledge, to, arabs, in, the, abbasid, caliphate, unlike, many, chinese, inventions, that, were, created, independently, in, western, europe, the, modern, papermaking, process, was, a, wholly, chinese, product, and, gradually, spread, via, the, arabs, to, europe, where, it, also, saw, widespread, manufacturing, by, the, 12th, century, on, 2, august, 2010, the, international, astronomical, union, honored, cai, s, legacy, by, naming, a, crater, on, the, moon, after, him, while, cai, s, personal, life, is, mostly, unknown, a, popular, folktale, suggests, he, was, a, shopkeeper, and, trickster, with, a, wife, and, brother, though, there, is, no, historical, confirmation, for, this, the, story, goes, that, after, cai, s, improvements, to, paper, there, was, little, demand, for, the, product, so, he, had, an, ever, growing, surplus, as, such, cai, and, his, wife, developed, a, ploy, to, increase, sales, they, told, townsfolk, that, paper, becomes, money, in, the, afterlife, when, burned, in, the, most, popular, variation, to, the, tale, cai, mo, and, hui, niang, cai, s, brother, and, sister, in, law, of, unconfirmed, historicity, take, the, place, of, cai, and, his, wife, in, this, version, hui, convinced, cai, mo, to, learn, the, new, papermaking, trade, from, his, younger, brother, and, when, he, returned, in, only, three, months, the, paper, he, and, his, wife, produced, was, too, low, quality, to, sell, to, address, this, hui, pretended, to, have, died, and, cai, mo, stood, beside, her, coffin, wailing, and, burning, money, as, tribute, then, their, neighbors, checked, in, on, them, and, hui, sprung, out, of, the, coffin, explaining, that, the, burned, money, was, transferred, to, her, in, the, afterlife, with, which, she, paid, ghosts, to, return, her, from, the, dead, believing, the, story, the, neighbors, quickly, purchased, large, amounts, of, paper, for, their, own, use, while, mostly, a, fictitious, story, intense, wailing, and, burning, offerings, are, commonplace, in, chinese, culture, of, those, who, originated, china, s, four, great, inventions, of, the, ancient, world, the, compass, gunpowder, papermaking, and, printing, only, the, inventor, of, papermaking, cai, lun, is, known, additionally, in, comparison, to, other, chinese, inventions, such, as, the, writing, brush, and, ink, the, development, of, paper, is, the, best, documented, in, literary, sources, after, his, death, in, 121, ce, a, shrine, with, his, grave, was, built, in, his, hometown, but, was, soon, neglected, and, damaged, by, floods, while, his, name, was, largely, forgotten, during, the, early, tang, dynasty, many, national, heroes, were, deified, such, as, li, bai, and, guan, yu, as, the, gods, of, wine, and, war, respectively, cai, was, among, the, important, people, declared, gods, and, was, deified, as, the, national, god, of, papermaking, cai, also, became, a, patron, saint, for, papermakers, with, his, image, often, being, painted, or, printed, onto, paper, mills, and, paper, shops, in, not, only, china, but, also, japan, in, 1267, a, man, named, chen, tsunghsi, raised, funds, to, repair, the, long, damaged, shrine, and, renovated, it, to, include, a, statue, of, cai, and, a, mausoleum, chen, stated, that, tsai, lung, s, extraordinary, talent, and, his, achievement, are, exemplary, to, all, ages, a, stone, mortar, which, legends, claim, cai, used, to, make, paper, may, have, been, brought, to, the, mausoleum, although, other, sources, say, it, was, brought, to, the, imperial, museum, in, the, capital, of, lin, an, a, great, ceremony, was, held, for, the, new, mausoleum, though, it, fell, into, ruin, again, and, was, restored, in, 1955, today, the, temple, still, stands, in, leiyang, as, the, cai, lun, temple, near, a, pool, renamed, the, cai, lun, pool, that, was, thought, to, be, near, cai, s, home, in, the, song, dynasty, fei, chu, fl, 1265, said, there, was, a, temple, in, chengdu, where, hundreds, of, families, in, the, papermaking, business, would, come, to, worship, cai, during, the, late, qing, dynasty, papermakers, created, religious, groups, known, as, either, spirit, money, associations, shenfubang, or, cai, lun, associations, cai, lun, hui, in, 1839, the, shenfubang, from, the, town, of, yingjiang, was, sued, by, shenfubangs, in, macun, and, zhongxing, of, jiajiang, county, sichuan, the, conflict, began, when, the, shenfubang, of, yingjiang, claimed, that, their, statue, of, cai, which, they, carried, throughout, jiajiang, county, annually, gave, them, ritual, supremacy, over, macun, and, zhongxing, papermakers, whom, they, demanded, pay, for, and, take, part, in, their, celebrations, the, shenfubangs, from, macun, and, zhongxing, denied, the, demand, citing, their, long, history, of, worshipping, cai, which, resulted, in, increasing, conflict, between, the, sides, and, eventually, a, lawsuit, the, county, magistrate, reproached, both, parties, for, descending, into, conflict, and, said, did, they, not, understand, that, all, of, them, owed, their, livelihood, to, lord, cai, who, had, taught, them, the, art, of, papermaking, were, they, not, all, disciples, of, lord, cai, who, wanted, them, to, share, the, benefits, of, the, trade, in, the, 21st, century, leiyang, is, still,
