for, evaluating, and, treating, pathologies, seen, as, originating, from, conflicts, in, the, psyche, through, dialogue, between, patient, and, psychoanalyst, and, the, distinctive, theory, of, mind, and, human, agency, derived, from, it, freud, was, born, to, galician, jewish, parents, in, the, moravian, town, of, freiberg, in, the, austrian, empire, he, qualified, as, a, doctor, of, medicine,

persecution, he, died, in, exile, in, the, united, kingdom, in, 1939, in, founding, psychoanalysis, freud, developed, therapeutic, techniques, such, as, the, use, of, free, association, and, discovered, transference, establishing, its, central, role, in, the, analytic, process, freud, s, redefinition, of, sexuality, to, include, its, infantile, forms, led, him, to, formulate, the, oedipus, complex, as, the, central, tenet, of, psychoanalytical, theory, his, analysis, of, dreams, as, wish, fulfilments, provided, him, with, models, for, the, clinical, analysis, of, symptom, formation, and, the, underlying, mechanisms, of, repression, on, this, basis, freud, elaborated, his, theory, of, the, unconscious, and, went, on, to, develop, a, model, of, psychic, structure, comprising, id, ego, and, super, ego, freud, postulated, the, existence, of, libido, sexualised, energy, with, which, mental, processes, and, structures, are, invested, and, which, generates, erotic, attachments, and, a, death, drive, the, source, of, compulsive, repetition, hate, aggression, and, neurotic, guilt, in, his, later, work, freud, developed, a, wide, ranging, interpretation, and, critique, of, religion, and, culture, though, in, overall, decline, as, a, diagnostic, and, clinical, practice, psychoanalysis, remains, influential, within, psychology, psychiatry, psychotherapy, and, across, the, humanities, it, thus, continues, to, generate, extensive, and, highly, contested, debate, concerning, its, therapeutic, efficacy, its, scientific, status, and, whether, it, advances, or, hinders, the, feminist, cause, nonetheless, freud, s, work, has, suffused, contemporary, western, thought, and, popular, culture, w, h, auden, s, 1940, poetic, tribute, to, freud, describes, him,

of, nervous, tissue, proved, seminal, for, the, subsequent, discovery, of, the, neuron, in, the, 1890s, freud, s, research, work, was, interrupted, in, 1879, by, the, obligation, to, undertake, a, year, s, compulsory, military, service, the, lengthy, downtimes, enabled, him, to, complete, a, commission, to, translate, four, essays, from, john, stuart, mill, s, collected, works, he, graduated, with, an, md, in, march, 1881, in, 1882, freud, began, his, medical, career, at, vienna, general, hospital, his, research, work, in, cerebral, anatomy, led, to, the, publication, in, 1884, of, an, influential, paper, on, the, palliative, effects, of, cocaine, and, his, work, on, aphasia, would, form, the, basis, of, his, first, book, on, aphasia, a, critical, study, published, in, 1891, over, a, three, year, period, freud, worked, in, various, departments, of, the, hospital, his, time, spent, in, theodor, meynert, s, psychiatric, clinic, and, as, a, locum, in, a, local, asylum, led, to, an, increased, interest, in, clinical, work, his, substantial, body, of, published, research, led, to, his, appointment, as, a, university, lecturer, or, docent, in, neuropathology, in, 1885, a, non, salaried, post, but, one, which, entitled, him, to, give, lectures, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, 1886, freud, resigned, his, hospital, post, and, entered, private, practice, specializing, in, nervous, disorders, the, same, year, he, married, martha, bernays, the, granddaughter, of, isaac, bernays, a, chief, rabbi, in, hamburg, freud, was, as, an, atheist, dismayed, at, the, requirement, in, austria, for, a, jewish, religious, ceremony, and, briefly, considered, before, dismissing, the, prospect, of, joining, the, protestant, confession, to, avoid, one, a, civil, ceremony, for, bernays, and, freud, took, place, on, 13, september, and, a, religious, ceremony, took, place, the, following, day, with, freud, having, been, hastily, tutored, in, the, hebrew, prayers, the, freuds, had, six, children, mathilde, b, 1887, jean, martin, b, 1889, oliver, b, 1891, ernst, b, 1892, sophie, b, 1893, and, anna, b, 1895, from, 1891, until, they, left, vienna, in, 1938, freud, and, his, family, lived, in, an, apartment, at, berggasse, 19, near, innere, stadt, on, 8, december, 1897, freud, was, initiated, into, the, german, jewish, cultural, association, b, nai, b, rith, to, which, he, remained, linked, for, all, his, life, freud, gave, a, speech, on, the, interpretation, of, dreams, which, had, an, enthusiastic, reception, it, anticipated, the, book, of, the, same, name, which, was, published, for, the, first, time, two, years, later, in, 1896, minna, bernays, martha, freud, s, sister, became, a, permanent, member, of, the, freud, household, after, the, death, of, her, fianc, the, close, relationship, she, formed, with, freud, led, to, rumours, started, by, carl, jung, of, an, affair, the, discovery, of, a, swiss, hotel, guest, book, entry, for, 13, august, 1898, signed, by, freud, whilst, travelling, with, his, sister, in, law, has, been, presented, as, evidence, of, the, affair, freud, began, smoking, tobacco, at, age, 24, initially, a, cigarette, smoker, he, became, a, cigar, smoker, he, believed, smoking, enhanced, his, capacity, to, work, and, that, he, could, exercise, self, control, in, moderating, it, despite, health, warnings, from, colleague, wilhelm, fliess, he, remained, a, smoker, eventually, developing, buccal, cancer, freud, suggested, to, fliess, in, 1897, that, addictions, including, that, to, tobacco, were, substitutes, for, masturbation, the, one, great, habit, freud, had, greatly, admired, his, philosophy, tutor, franz, brentano, who, was, known, for, his, theories, of, perception, and, introspection, brentano, discussed, the, possible, existence, of, the, unconscious, mind, in, his, psychology, from, an, empirical, standpoint, 1874, although, brentano, denied, its, existence, his, discussion, of, the, unconscious, probably, helped, introduce, freud, to, the, concept, freud, owned, and, made, use, of, charles, darwin, s, major, evolutionary, writings, and, was, also, influenced, by, eduard, von, hartmann, s, the, philosophy, of, the, unconscious, 1869, other, texts, of, importance, to, freud, were, by, fechner, and, herbart, with, the, latter, s, psychology, as, science, arguably, considered, to, be, of, underrated, significance, in, this, respect, freud, also, drew, on, the, work, of, theodor, lipps, who, was, one, of, the, main, contemporary, theorists, of, the, concepts, of, the, unconscious, and, empathy, though, freud, was, reluctant, to, associate, his, psychoanalytic, insights, with, prior, philosophical, theories, attention, has, been, drawn, to, analogies, between, his, work, and, that, of, both, schopenhauer, and, nietzsche, in, 1908, freud, said, that, he, occasionally, read, nietzsche, and, was, strongly, fascinated, by, his, writings, but, did, not, study, him, because, he, found, nietzsche, s, intuitive, insights, resembled, too, much, his, own, work, at, the, time, and, also, because, he, was, overwhelmed, by, the, wealth, of, ideas, he, encountered, when, he, read, nietzsche, freud, sometimes, would, deny, the, influence, of, nietzsche, s, ideas, one, historian, quotes, peter, l, rudnytsky, who, says, that, based, on, freud, s, correspondence, with, his, adolescent, friend, eduard, silberstein, freud, read, nietzsche, s, the, birth, of, tragedy, and, probably, the, first, two, of, the, untimely, meditations, when, he, was, seventeen, freud, bought, nietzsche, s, collected, works, in, 1900, telling, wilhelm, fliess, that, he, hoped, to, find, in, nietzsche, s, works, the, words, for, much, that, remains, mute, in, me, later, he, said, he, had, not, yet, opened, them, freud, came, to, treat, nietzsche, s, writings, according, to, peter, gay, as, texts, to, be, resisted, far, more, than, to, be, studied, his, interest, in, philosophy, declined, after, he, decided, on, a, career, in, neurology, freud, read, william, shakespeare, in, english, his, understanding, of, human, psychology, may, have, been, partially, derived, from, shakespeare, s, plays, freud, s, jewish, origins, and, his, allegiance, to, his, secular, jewish, identity, were, of, significant, influence, in, the, formation, of, his, intellectual, and, moral, outlook, especially, concerning, his, intellectual, non, conformism, as, he, pointed, out, in, his, autobiographical, study, they, would, also, have, a, substantial, effect, on, the, content, of, psychoanalytic, ideas, particularly, in, respect, of, their, common, concerns, with, depth, interpretation, and, the, bounding, of, desire, by, law, during, the, formative, period, of, his, work, freud, valued, and, came, to, rely, on, the, intellectual, and, emotional, support, of, his, friend, wilhelm, fliess, a, berlin, based, ear, nose, and, throat, specialist, whom, he, had, first, met, in, 1887, both, men, saw, themselves, as, isolated, from, the, prevailing, clinical, and, theoretical, mainstream, because, of, their, ambitions, to, develop, radical, new, theories, of, sexuality, fliess, developed, highly, eccentric, theories, of, human, biorhythms, and, a, nasogenital, connection, which, are, today, considered, pseudoscientific, he, shared, freud, s, views, on, the, importance, of, certain, aspects, of, sexuality, masturbation, coitus, interruptus, and, the, use, of, condoms, in, the, etiology, of, what, was, then, called, the, actual, neuroses, primarily, neurasthenia, and, certain, physically, manifested, anxiety, symptoms, they, maintained, an, extensive, correspondence, from, which, freud, drew, on, fliess, s, speculations, on, infantile, sexuality, and, bisexuality, to, elaborate, and, revise, his, own, ideas, his, first, attempt, at, a, systematic, theory, of, the, mind, his, project, for, a, scientific, psychology, was, developed, as, a, metapsychology, with, fliess, as, interlocutor, however, freud, s, efforts, to, build, a, bridge, between, neurology, and, psychology, were, eventually, abandoned, after, they, had, reached, an, impasse, as, his, letters, to, fliess, reveal, though, some, ideas, of, the, project, were, to, be, taken, up, again, in, the, concluding, chapter, of, the, interpretation, of, dreams, freud, had, fliess, repeatedly, operate, on, his, nose, and, sinuses, to, treat, nasal, reflex, neurosis, and, subsequently, referred, his, patient, emma, eckstein, to, him, according, to, freud, her, history, of, symptoms, included, severe, leg, pains, with, consequent, restricted, mobility, as, well, as, stomach, and, menstrual, pains, these, pains, were, according, to, fliess, s, theories, caused, by, habitual, masturbation, which, as, the, tissue, of, the, nose, and, genitalia, were, linked, was, curable, by, removal, of, part, of, the, middle, turbinate, fliess, s, surgery, proved, disastrous, resulting, in, profuse, recurrent, nasal, bleeding, he, had, left, a, half, metre, of, gauze, in, eckstein, s, nasal, cavity, whose, subsequent, removal, left, her, permanently, disfigured, at, first, though, aware, of, fliess, s, culpability, and, regarding, the, remedial, surgery, in, horror, freud, could, bring, himself, only, to, intimate, delicately, in, his, correspondence, with, fliess, the, nature, of, his, disastrous, role, and, in, subsequent, letters, maintained, a, tactful, silence, on, the, matter, or, else, returned, to, the, face, saving, topic, of, eckstein, s, hysteria, freud, ultimately, in, light, of, eckstein, s, history, of, adolescent, self, cutting, and, irregular, nasal, and, menstrual, bleeding, concluded, that, fliess, was, completely, without, blame, as, eckstein, s, post, operative, haemorrhages, were, hysterical, wish, bleedings, linked, to, an, old, wish, to, be, loved, in, her, illness, and, triggered, as, a, means, of, rearousing, affection, eckstein, nonetheless, continued, her, analysis, with, freud, she, was, restored, to, full, mobility, and, went, on, to, practice, psychoanalysis, herself, freud, who, had, called, fliess, the, kepler, of, biology, later, concluded, that, a, combination, of, a, homoerotic, attachment, and, the, residue, of, his, specifically, jewish, mysticism, lay, behind, his, loyalty, to, his, jewish, friend, and, his, consequent, overestimation, of, both, his, theoretical, and, clinical, work, their, friendship, came, to, an, acrimonious, end, with, fliess, angry, at, freud, s, unwillingness, to, endorse, his, general, theory, of, sexual, periodicity, and, accusing, him, of, collusion, in, the, plagiarism, of, his, work, after, fliess, failed, to, respond, to, freud, s, offer, of, collaboration, over, the, publication, of, his, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, in, 1906, their, relationship, came, to, an, end, in, october, 1885, freud, went, to, paris, on, a, three, month, fellowship, to, study, with, jean, martin, charcot, a, renowned, neurologist, who, was, conducting, scientific, research, into, hypnosis, he, was, later, to, recall, the, experience, of, this, stay, as, catalytic, in, turning, him, toward, the, practice, of, medical, psychopathology, and, away, from, a, less, financially, promising, career, in, neurology, research, charcot, specialized, in, the, study, of, hysteria, and, susceptibility, to, hypnosis, which, he, frequently, demonstrated, with, patients, on, stage, in, front, of, an, audience, once, he, had, set, up, in, private, practice, in, vienna, in, 1886, freud, began, using, hypnosis, in, his, clinical, work, he, adopted, the, approach, of, his, friend, and, collaborator, josef, breuer, in, a, type, of, hypnosis, that, was, different, from, the, french, methods, he, had, studied, in, that, it, did, not, use, suggestion, the, treatment, of, one, particular, patient, of, breuer, s, proved, to, be, transformative, for, freud, s, clinical, practice, described, as, anna, o, she, was, invited, to, talk, about, her, symptoms, while, under, hypnosis, she, would, coin, the, phrase, talking, cure, her, symptoms, became, reduced, in, severity, as, she, retrieved, memories, of, traumatic, incidents, associated, with, their, onset, the, inconsistent, results, of, freud, s, early, clinical, work, eventually, led, him, to, abandon, hypnosis, having, concluded, that, more, consistent, and, effective, symptom, relief, could, be, achieved, by, encouraging, patients, to, talk, freely, without, censorship, or, inhibition, about, whatever, ideas, or, memories, occurred, to, them, he, called, this, procedure, free, association, in, conjunction, with, this, freud, found, that, patients, dreams, could, be, fruitfully, analyzed, to, reveal, the, complex, structuring, of, unconscious, material, and, to, demonstrate, the, psychic, action, of, repression, which, he, had, concluded, underlay, symptom, formation, by, 1896, he, was, using, the, term, psychoanalysis, to, refer, to, his, new, clinical, method, and, the, theories, on, which, it, was, based, freud, s, development, of, these, new, theories, took, place, during, a, period, in, which, he, experienced, heart, irregularities, disturbing, dreams, and, periods, of, depression, a, neurasthenia, which, he, linked, to, the, death, of, his, father, in, 1896, and, which, prompted, a, self, analysis, of, his, own, dreams, and, memories, of, childhood, his, explorations, of, his, feelings, of, hostility, to, his, father, and, rivalrous, jealousy, over, his, mother, s, affections, led, him, to, fundamentally, revise, his, theory, of, the, origin, of, the, neuroses, based, on, his, early, clinical, work, freud, postulated, that, unconscious, memories, of, sexual, molestation, in, early, childhood, were, a, necessary, precondition, for, psychoneuroses, hysteria, and, obsessional, neurosis, a, formulation, now, known, as, freud, s, seduction, theory, in, the, light, of, his, self, analysis, freud, abandoned, the, theory, that, every, neurosis, can, be, traced, back, to, the, effects, of, infantile, sexual, abuse, now, arguing, that, infantile, sexual, scenarios, still, had, a, causative, function, but, it, did, not, matter, whether, they, were, real, or, imagined, and, that, in, either, case, they, became, pathogenic, only, when, acting, as, repressed, memories, this, transition, from, the, theory, of, infantile, sexual, trauma, as, a, general, explanation, of, how, all, neuroses, originate, to, one, that, presupposes, autonomous, infantile, sexuality, provided, the, basis, for, freud, s, subsequent, formulation, of, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, freud, described, the, evolution, of, his, clinical, method, and, set, out, his, theory, of, the, psychogenetic, origins, of, hysteria, demonstrated, in, several, case, histories, in, studies, on, hysteria, published, in, 1895, co, authored, with, josef, breuer, in, 1899, he, published, the, interpretation, of, dreams, in, which, following, a, critical, review, of, existing, theory, freud, gives, detailed, interpretations, of, his, own, and, his, patients, dreams, in, terms, of, wish, fulfillments, made, subject, to, the, repression, and, censorship, of, the, dream, work, he, then, sets, out, the, theoretical, model, of, mental, structure, the, unconscious, pre, conscious, and, conscious, on, which, this, account, is, based, an, abridged, version, on, dreams, was, published, in, 1901, in, works, that, would, win, him, a, more, general, readership, freud, applied, his, theories, outside, the, clinical, setting, in, the, psychopathology, of, everyday, life, 1901, and, jokes, and, their, relation, to, the, unconscious, 1905, in, three, essays, on, the, theory, of, sexuality, published, in, 1905, freud, elaborates, his, theory, of, infantile, sexuality, describing, its, polymorphous, perverse, forms, and, the, functioning, of, the, drives, to, which, it, gives, rise, in, the, formation, of, sexual, identity, the, same, year, he, published, fragment, of, an, analysis, of, a, case, of, hysteria, which, became, one, of, his, more, famous, and, controversial, case, studies, known, as, the, dora, case, study, for, freud, it, was, illustrative, of, hysteria, as, a, symptom, and, contributed, to, his, understanding, of, the, importance, of, transference, as, a, clinical, phenomena, in, other, of, his, early, case, studies, freud, set, out, to, describe, the, symptomatology, of, obsessional, neurosis, in, the, case, of, the, rat, man, and, phobia, in, the, case, of, little, hans, in, 1902, freud, at, last, realised, his, long, standing, ambition, to, be, made, a, university, professor, the, title, professor, extraordinarius, was, important, to, freud, for, the, recognition, and, prestige, it, conferred, there, being, no, salary, or, teaching, duties, attached, to, the, post, he, would, be, granted, the, enhanced, status, of, professor, ordinarius, in, 1920, despite, support, from, the, university, his, appointment, had, been, blocked, in, successive, years, by, the, political, authorities, and, it, was, secured, only, with, the, intervention, of, an, influential, ex, patient, baroness, marie, ferstel, who, supposedly, had, to, bribe, the, minister, of, education, with, a, valuable, painting, freud, continued, with, the, regular, series, of, lectures, on, his, work, which, since, the, mid, 1880s, as, a, docent, of, vienna, university, he, had, been, delivering, to, small, audiences, every, saturday, evening, at, the, lecture, hall, of, the, university, s, psychiatric, clinic, from, the, autumn, of, 1902, a, number, of, viennese, physicians, who, had, expressed, interest, in, freud, s, work, were, invited, to, meet, at, his, apartment, every, wednesday, afternoon, to, discuss, issues, relating, to, psychology, and, neuropathology, this, group, was, called, the, wednesday, psychological, society, psychologische, mittwochs, gesellschaft, and, it, marked, the, beginnings, of, the, worldwide, psychoanalytic, movement, freud, founded, this, discussion, group, at, the, suggestion, of, the, physician, wilhelm, stekel, stekel, had, studied, medicine, his, conversion, to, psychoanalysis, is, variously, attributed, to, his, successful, treatment, by, freud, for, a, sexual, problem, or, as, a, result, of, his, reading, the, interpretation, of, dreams, to, which, he, subsequently, gave, a, positive, review, in, the, viennese, daily, newspaper, neues, wiener, tagblatt, the, other, three, original, members, whom, freud, invited, to, attend, alfred, adler, max, kahane, and, rudolf, reitler, were, also, physicians, and, all, five, were, jewish, by, birth, both, kahane, and, reitler, were, childhood, friends, of, freud, who, had, gone, to, university, with, him, and, kept, abreast, of, freud, s, developing, ideas, by, attending, his, saturday, evening, lectures, in, 1901, kahane, who, first, introduced, stekel, to, freud, s, work, had, opened, an, out, patient, psychotherapy, institute, of, which, he, was, the, director, in, vienna, in, the, same, year, his, medical, textbook, outline, of, internal, medicine, for, students, and, practicing, physicians, was, published, in, it, he, provided, an, outline, of, freud, s, psychoanalytic, method, kahane, broke, with, freud, and, left, the, wednesday, psychological, society, in, 1907, for, unknown, reasons, and, in, 1923, committed, suicide, reitler, was, the, director, of, an, establishment, providing, thermal, cures, in, dorotheergasse, which, had, been, founded, in, 1901, he, died, prematurely, in, 1917, adler, regarded, as, the, most, formidable, intellect, among, the, early, freud,

decisive, word, was, always, spoken, by, freud, himself, there, was, the, atmosphere, of, the, foundation, of, a, religion, in, that, room, freud, himself, was, its, new, prophet, who, made, the, heretofore, prevailing, methods, of, psychological, investigation, appear, superficial, by, 1906, the, group, had, grown, to, sixteen, members, including, otto, rank, who, was, employed, as, the,

distinguished, neurologist, and, psychiatrist, james, jackson, putnam, professor, of, diseases, of, the, nervous, system, at, harvard, who, invited, freud, to, his, country, retreat, where, they, held, extensive, discussions, over, a, period, of, four, days, putnam, s, subsequent, public, endorsement, of, freud, s, work, represented, a, significant, breakthrough, for, the, psychoanalytic,

subsequently, withdrew, from, the, international, psychoanalytical, association, ipa, and, founded, their, own, schools, from, 1909, adler, s, views, on, topics, such, as, neurosis, began, to, differ, markedly, from, those, held, by, freud, as, adler, s, position, appeared, increasingly, incompatible, with, freudianism, a, series, of, confrontations, between, their, respective, viewpoints, took, place, at, the, meetings, of, the, viennese, psychoanalytic, society, in, january, and, february, 1911, in, february, 1911, adler, then, the, president, of, the, society, resigned, his, position, at, this, time, stekel, also, resigned, from, his, position, as, vice, president, of, the, society, adler, finally, left, the, freudian, group, altogether, in, june, 1911, to, form, his, own, organization, with, nine, other, members, who, had, also, resigned, from, the, group, this, new, formation, was, initially, called, society, for, free, psychoanalysis, but, it, was, soon, renamed, the, society, for, individual, psychology, in, the, period, after, world, war, i, adler, became, increasingly, associated, with, a, psychological, position, he, devised, called, individual, psychology, in, 1912, jung, published, wandlungen, und, symbole, der, libido, published, in, english, in, 1916, as, psychology, of, the, unconscious, making, it, clear, that, his, views, were, taking, a, direction, quite, different, from, those, of, freud, to, distinguish, his, system, from, psychoanalysis, jung, called, it, analytical, psychology, anticipating, the, final, breakdown, of, the, relationship, between, freud, and, jung, ernest, jones, initiated, the, formation, of, a, secret, committee, of, loyalists, charged, with, safeguarding, the, theoretical, coherence, and, institutional, legacy, of, the, psychoanalytic, movement, formed, in, the, autumn, of, 1912, the, committee, comprised, freud, jones, abraham, ferenczi, rank, and, hanns, sachs, max, eitingon, joined, the, committee, in, 1919, each, member, pledged, himself, not, to, make, any, public, departure, from, the, fundamental, tenets, of, psychoanalytic, theory, before, he, had, discussed, his, views, with, the, others, after, this, development, jung, recognised, that, his, position, was, untenable, and, resigned, as, editor, of, the, jahrbuch, and, then, as, president, of, the, ipa, in, april, 1914, the, z, rich, branch, of, the, ipa, withdrew, from, membership, the, following, july, later, the, same, year, freud, published, a, paper, entitled, the, history, of, the, psychoanalytic, movement, the, german, original, being, first, published, in, the, jahrbuch, giving, his, view, on, the, birth, and, evolution, of, the, psychoanalytic, movement, and, the, withdrawal, of, adler, and, jung, from, it, the, final, defection, from, freud, s, inner, circle, occurred, following, the, publication, in, 1924, of, rank, s, the, trauma, of, birth, which, other, members, of, the, committee, read, as, in, effect, abandoning, the, oedipus, complex, as, the, central, tenet, of, psychoanalytic, theory, abraham, and, jones, became, increasingly, forceful, critics, of, rank, and, though, he, and, freud, were, reluctant, to, end, their, close, and, long, standing, relationship, the, break, finally, came, in, 1926, when, rank, resigned, from, his, official, posts, in, the, ipa, and, left, vienna, for, paris, his, place, on, the, committee, was, taken, by, anna, freud, rank, eventually, settled, in, the, united, states, where, his, revisions, of, freudian, theory, were, to, influence, a, new, generation, of, therapists, uncomfortable, with, the, orthodoxies, of, the, ipa, after, the, founding, of, the, ipa, in, 1910, an, international, network, of, psychoanalytical, societies, training, institutes, and, clinics, became, well, established, and, a, regular, schedule, of, biannual, congresses, commenced, after, the, end, of, world, war, i, to, coordinate, their, activities, and, as, a, forum, for, presenting, papers, on, clinical, and, theoretical, topics, abraham, and, eitingon, founded, the, berlin, psychoanalytic, society, in, 1910, and, then, the, berlin,

first, such, establishment, to, provide, psychoanalytic, treatment, in, an, institutional, framework, freud, organised, a, fund, to, help, finance, its, activities, and, his, architect, son, ernst,

cancerous, jaw, he, kept, abreast, of, developments, through, regular, correspondence, with, his, principal, followers, and, via, the, circular, letters, and, meetings, of, the, secret, committee, which, he, continued, to, attend, the, committee, continued, to, function, until, 1927, by, which, time, institutional, developments, within, the, ipa, such, as, the, establishment, of, the, international, training, commission, had, addressed, concerns, about, the, transmission, of, psychoanalytic, theory, and, practice, there, remained, however, significant, differences, over, the, issue, of, lay, analysis, i, e, the, acceptance, of, non, medically, qualified, candidates, for, psychoanalytic, training, freud, set, out, his, case, in, favour, in, 1926, in, his, the, question, of, lay, analysis, he, was, resolutely, opposed, by, the, american, societies, who, expressed, concerns, over, professional, standards, and, the, risk, of, litigation, though, child, analysts, were, made, exempt, these, concerns, were, also, shared, by, some, of, his, european, colleagues, eventually, an, agreement, was, reached, allowing, societies, autonomy, in, setting, criteria, for, candidature,

freud, later, consulted, the, dermatologist, maximilian, steiner, who, advised, him, to, quit, smoking, while, minimizing, the, lesion, s, implications, shorter, after, freud, met, with, felix,

destruction, of, the, historic, library, of, books, housed, at, the, ipa, sauerwald, did, neither, instead, he, removed, evidence, of, freud, s, foreign, bank, accounts, to, his, own, safe, keeping, and, arranged, the, storage, of, the, ipa, library, in, the, austrian, national, library, where, it, remained, until, the, end, of, the, war, though, sauerwald, s, intervention, lessened, the,

circumstances, where, he, met, freud, s, brother, alexander, he, was, tried, and, imprisoned, in, 1945, by, an, austrian, court, for, his, activities, as, a, nazi, party, official, responding, to, a, plea, from, his, wife, anna, freud, wrote, to, confirm, that, sauerwald, used, his, office, as, our, appointed, commissar, in, such, a, manner, as, to, protect, my, father, her, intervention, helped, secure, his, release, in, 1947, the, freud, s, new, family, home, was, established, in, hampstead, at, 20, maresfield, gardens, in, september, 1938, freud, s, architect, son, ernst, designed,

of, the, jaw, was, causing, him, increasingly, severe, pain, and, had, been, declared, inoperable, the, last, book, he, read, balzac, s, la, peau, de, chagrin, prompted, reflections, on, his, own, increasing, frailty, and, a, few, days, later, he, turned, to, his, doctor, friend, and, fellow, refugee, max, schur, reminding, him, that, they, had, previously, discussed, the, terminal, stages, of, his, illness, schur, you, remember, our, contract, not, to, leave, me, in, the, lurch, when, the, time, had, come, now, it, is, nothing, but, torture, and, makes, no, sense, when, schur, replied, that, he, had, not, forgotten, freud, said, i, thank, you, and, then, talk, it, over, with, anna, and, if, she, thinks, it, s, right, then, make, an, end, of, it, anna, freud, wanted, to, postpone, her, father, s, death, but, schur, convinced, her, it, was, pointless, to, keep, him, alive, on, 21, and, 22, september, he, administered, doses, of, morphine, that, resulted, in, freud, s, death, at, around, 3, am, on, 23, september, 1939, however, discrepancies, in, the, accounts, schur, gave, of, his, role, in, freud, s, final, hours, led, to, inconsistencies, between, freud, s, main, biographers, a, revised, account, proposes, that, schur, was, absent, from, freud, s, deathbed, when, a, third, and, final, dose, of, morphine, was, administered, by, dr, josephine, stross, a, colleague, of, anna, freud, leading, to, freud, s, death, at, around, midnight, on, 23, september, 1939, three, days, after, his, death, freud, s, body, was, cremated, at, golders, green, crematorium,

with, dionysian, scenes, that, freud, had, received, as, a, gift, from, marie, bonaparte, and, which, he, had, kept, in, his, study, in, vienna, for, many, years, after, his, wife, martha, died, in, 1951, her, ashes, were, also, placed, in, the, urn, freud, began, his, study, of, medicine, at, the, university, of, vienna, in, 1873, he, took, almost, nine, years, to, finish, due, to, his, interest, in, neurophysiological, research, specifically, investigation, of, the, sexual, anatomy, of, eels, and, the, physiology, of, the, fish, nervous, system, and, because, of, his, interest, in, studying, philosophy, with, franz, brentano, he, entered, private, practice, in, neurology, for, financial, reasons, receiving, his, m, d, in, 1881, at, the, age, of, 25, amongst, his, principal, concerns, in, the, 1880s, was, the, anatomy, of, the, brain, specifically, the, medulla, oblongata, he, intervened, in, the, important, debates, about, aphasia, with, his, monograph, of, 1891, zur, auffassung, der, aphasien, in, which, he, coined, the, term, agnosia, and, counselled, against, a, too, locationist, view, of, the, explanation, of, neurological, deficits, like, his, contemporary, eugen, bleuler, he, emphasized, brain, function, rather, than, brain, structure, freud, was, also, an, early, researcher, in, the, field, of, cerebral, palsy, which, was, then, known, as, cerebral, paralysis, he, published, several, medical, papers, on, the, topic, and, showed, that, the, disease, existed, long, before, other, researchers, of, the, period, began, to, study, it, he, suggested, that, william, john, little, the, man, who, first, identified, cerebral, palsy, was, wrong, about, lack, of, oxygen, during, birth, being, a, cause, instead, he, suggested, that, complications, in, birth, were, a, symptom, the, origin, of, freud, s, early, work, with, psychoanalysis, can, be, linked, to, josef, breuer, freud, credited, breuer, with, opening, the, way, to, the, discovery, of, the, psychoanalytical, method, by, his, treatment, of, the, case, of, anna, o, in, november, 1880, breuer, was, called, in, to, treat, a, highly, intelligent, 21, year, old, woman, bertha, pappenheim, for, a, persistent, cough, and, hallucinations, that, he, diagnosed, as, hysterical, he, found, that, while, nursing, her, dying, father, she, had, developed, some, transitory, symptoms, including, visual, disorders, and, paralysis, and, contractures, of, limbs, which, he, also, diagnosed, as, hysterical, breuer, began, to, see, his, patient, almost, every, day, as, the, symptoms, increased, and, became, more, persistent, and, observed, that, she, entered, states, of, absence, he, found, that, when, with, his, encouragement, she, told, fantasy, stories, in, her, evening, states, of, absence, her, condition, improved, and, most, of, her, symptoms, had, disappeared, by, april, 1881, following, the, death, of, her, father, in, that, month, her, condition, deteriorated, breuer, recorded, that, some, of, the, symptoms, eventually, remitted, spontaneously, and, that, full, recovery, was, achieved, by, inducing, her, to, recall, events, that, had, precipitated, the, occurrence, of, a, specific, symptom, in, the, years, immediately, following, breuer, s, treatment, anna, o, spent, three, short, periods, in, sanatoria, with, the, diagnosis, hysteria, with, somatic, symptoms, and, some, authors, have, challenged, breuer, s, published, account, of, a, cure, richard, skues, rejects, this, interpretation, which, he, sees, as, stemming, from, both, freudian, and, anti, psychoanalytical, revisionism, revisionism, that, regards, both, breuer, s, narrative, of, the, case, as, unreliable, and, his, treatment, of, anna, o, as, a, failure, in, the, early, 1890s, freud, used, a, form, of, treatment, based, on, the, one, that, breuer, had, described, to, him, modified, by, what, he, called, his, pressure, technique, and, his, newly, developed, analytic, technique, of, interpretation, and, reconstruction, according, to, freud, s, later, accounts, of, this, period, as, a, result, of, his, use, of, this, procedure, most, of, his, patients, in, the, mid, 1890s, reported, early, childhood, sexual, abuse, he, believed, these, accounts, which, he, used, as, the, basis, for, his, seduction, theory, but, then, he, came, to, believe, that, they, were, fantasies, he, explained, these, at, first, as, having, the, function, of, fending, off, memories, of, infantile, masturbation, but, in, later, years, he, wrote, that, they, represented, oedipal, fantasies, stemming, from, innate, drives, that, are, sexual, and, destructive, in, nature, another, version, of, events, focuses, on, freud, s, proposing, that, unconscious, memories, of, infantile, sexual, abuse, were, at, the, root, of, the, psychoneuroses, in, letters, to, fliess, in, october, 1895, before, he, reported, that, he, had, actually, discovered, such, abuse, among, his, patients, in, the, first, half, of, 1896, freud, published, three, papers, which, led, to, his, seduction, theory, stating, that, he, had, uncovered, in, all, of, his, current, patients, deeply, repressed, memories, of, sexual, abuse, in, early, childhood, in, these, papers, freud, recorded, that, his, patients, were, not, consciously, aware, of, these, memories, and, must, therefore, be, present, as, unconscious, memories, if, they, were, to, result, in, hysterical, symptoms, or, obsessional, neurosis, the, patients, were, subjected, to, considerable, pressure, to, reproduce, infantile, sexual, abuse, scenes, that, freud, was, convinced, had, been, repressed, into, the, unconscious, patients, were, generally, unconvinced, that, their, experiences, of, freud, s, clinical, procedure, indicated, actual, sexual, abuse, he, reported, that, even, after, a, supposed, reproduction, of, sexual, scenes, the, patients, assured, him, emphatically, of, their, disbelief, as, well, as, his, pressure, technique, freud, s, clinical, procedures, involved, analytic, inference, and, the, symbolic, interpretation, of, symptoms, to, trace, back, to, memories, of, infantile, sexual, abuse, his, claim, of, one, hundred, percent, confirmation, of, his, theory, only, served, to, reinforce, previously, expressed, reservations, from, his, colleagues, about, the, validity, of, findings, obtained, through, his, suggestive, techniques, freud, subsequently, showed, inconsistency, as, to, whether, his, seduction, theory, was, still, compatible, with, his, later, findings, in, an, addendum, to, the, aetiology, of, hysteria, he, stated, all, this, is, true, but, it, must, be, remembered, that, at, the, time, i, wrote, it, i, had, not, yet, freed, myself, from, my, overvaluation, of, reality, and, my, low, valuation, of, phantasy, some, years, later, freud, explicitly, rejected, the, claim, of, his, colleague, ferenczi, that, his, patients, reports, of, sexual, molestation, were, actual, memories, instead, of, fantasies, and, he, tried, to, dissuade, ferenczi, from, making, his, views, public, karin, ahbel, rappe, concludes, that, freud, marked, out, and, started, down, a, trail, of, investigation, into, the, nature, of, the, experience, of, infantile, incest, and, its, impact, on, the, human, psyche, and, then, abandoned, this, direction, for, the, most, part, as, a, medical, researcher, freud, was, an, early, user, and, proponent, of, cocaine, as, a, stimulant, as, well, as, analgesic, he, believed, that, cocaine, was, a, cure, for, many, mental, and, physical, problems, and, in, his, 1884, paper, on, coca, he, extolled, its, virtues, between, 1883, and, 1887, he, wrote, several, articles, recommending, medical, applications, including, its, use, as, an, antidepressant, he, narrowly, missed, out, on, obtaining, scientific, priority, for, discovering, its, anesthetic, properties, of, which, he, was, aware, but, had, mentioned, only, in, passing, karl, koller, a, colleague, of, freud, s, in, vienna, received, that, distinction, in, 1884, after, reporting, to, a, medical, society, the, ways, cocaine, could, be, used, in, delicate, eye, surgery, freud, also, recommended, cocaine, as, a, cure, for, morphine, addiction, he, had, introduced, cocaine, to, his, friend, ernst, von, fleischl, marxow, who, had, become, addicted, to, morphine, taken, to, relieve, years, of, excruciating, nerve, pain, resulting, from, an, infection, acquired, after, injuring, himself, while, performing, an, autopsy, his, claim, that, fleischl, marxow, was, cured, of, his, addiction, was, premature, though, he, never, acknowledged, that, he, had, been, at, fault, fleischl, marxow, developed, an, acute, case, of, cocaine, psychosis, and, soon, returned, to, using, morphine, dying, a, few, years, later, still, suffering, from, intolerable, pain, the, application, as, an, anaesthetic, turned, out, to, be, one, of, the, few, safe, uses, of, cocaine, and, as, reports, of, addiction, and, overdose, began, to, filter, in, from, many, places, in, the, world, freud, s, medical, reputation, became, somewhat, tarnished, after, the, cocaine, episode, freud, ceased, to, publicly, recommend, the, use, of, the, drug, but, continued, to, take, it, himself, occasionally, for, depression, migraine, and, nasal, inflammation, during, the, early, 1890s, before, discontinuing, its, use, in, 1896, the, concept, of, the, unconscious, which, freud, regarded, as, already, well, known, amongst, poets, was, important, to, his, theories, and, ideas, he, also, believed, that, it, was, his, responsibility, to, ensure, that, it, received, scientific, recognition, in, the, field, of, psychology, freud, states, explicitly, that, his, concept, of, the, unconscious, as, he, first, formulated, it, was, based, on, the, theory, of, repression, in, his, formulations, of, the, concept, of, repression, in, his, 1915, paper, repression, standard, edition, xiv, freud, introduces, the, distinction, in, the, unconscious, between, primary, repression, linked, to, the, universal, taboo, on, incest, innately, present, originally, and, repression, after, expulsion, that, was, a, product, of, an, individual, s, life, history, acquired, in, the, course, of, the, ego, s, development, in, which, something, that, was, at, one, point, conscious, is, rejected, or, eliminated, from, consciousness, in, his, account, of, the, development, and, modification, of, his, theory, of, unconscious, mental, processes, he, sets, out, in, his, 1915, paper, the, unconscious, standard, edition, xiv, freud, identifies, the, three, perspectives, he, employs, the, dynamic, the, economic, and, the, topographical, the, dynamic, perspective, concerns, firstly, the, constitution, of, the, unconscious, by, repression, and, secondly, the, process, of, censorship, which, maintains, unwanted, anxiety, inducing, thoughts, as, such, here, freud, is, drawing, on, observations, from, his, earliest, clinical, work, in, the, treatment, of, hysteria, in, the, economic, perspective, the, focus, is, on, the, trajectories, of, the, repressed, contents, the, vicissitudes, of, sexual, impulses, as, they, undergo, complex, transformations, in, the, process, of, both, symptom, formation, and, normal, unconscious, thought, such, as, dreams, and, slips, of, the, tongue, these, were, topics, freud, explored, in, detail, in, the, interpretation, of, dreams, and, the, psychopathology, of, everyday, life, whereas, both, these, former, perspectives, focus, on, the, unconscious, as, it, is, about, to, enter, consciousness, the, topographical, perspective, represents, a, shift, in, which, the, systemic, properties, of, the, unconscious, its, characteristic, processes, and, modes, of, operation, such, as, condensation, and, displacement, are, placed, in, the, foreground, this, first, topography, presents, a, model, of, psychic, structure, comprising, three, systems, in, his, later, work, notably, in, the, ego, and, the, id, 1923, a, second, topography, is, introduced, comprising, id, ego, and, super, ego, which, is, superimposed, on, the, first, without, replacing, it, in, this, later, formulation, of, the, concept, of, the, unconscious, the, id, comprises, a, reservoir, of, instincts, or, drives, a, portion, of, them, being, hereditary, or, innate, a, portion, repressed, or, acquired, as, such, from, the, economic, perspective, the, id, is, the, prime, source, of, psychical, energy, and, from, the, dynamic, perspective, it, conflicts, with, the, ego, and, the, super, ego, which, genetically, speaking, are, diversifications, of, the, id, in, freud, s, theory, dreams, are, instigated, by, the, daily, occurrences, and, thoughts, of, everyday, life, in, what, freud, called, the, dream, work, these, secondary, process, thoughts, word, presentations, governed, by, the, rules, of, language, and, the, reality, principle, become, subject, to, the, primary, process, of, unconscious, thought, thing, presentations, governed, by, the, pleasure, principle, wish, gratification, and, the, repressed, sexual, scenarios, of, childhood, because, of, the, disturbing, nature, of, the, latter, and, other, repressed, thoughts, and, desires, which, may, have, become, linked, to, them, the, dream, work, operates, a, censorship, function, disguising, by, distortion, displacement, and, condensation, the, repressed, thoughts, to, preserve, sleep, in, the, clinical, setting, freud, encouraged, free, association, to, the, dream, s, manifest, content, as, recounted, in, the, dream, narrative, to, facilitate, interpretative, work, on, its, latent, content, the, repressed, thoughts, and, fantasies, and, also, on, the, underlying, mechanisms, and, structures, operative, in, the, dream, work, as, freud, developed, his, theoretical, work, on, dreams, he, went, beyond, his, theory, of, dreams, as, wish, fulfillments, to, arrive, at, an, emphasis, on, dreams, as, nothing, other, than, a, particular, form, of, thinking, it, is, the, dream, work, that, creates, that, form, and, it, alone, is, the, essence, of, dreaming, freud, s, theory, of, psychosexual, development, proposes, that, following, on, from, the, initial, polymorphous, perversity, of, infantile, sexuality, the, sexual, drives, pass, through, the, distinct, developmental, phases, of, the, oral, the, anal, and, the, phallic, though, these, phases, then, give, way, to, a, latency, stage, of, reduced, sexual, interest, and, activity, from, the, age, of, five, to, puberty, approximately, they, leave, a, perverse, and, bisexual, residue, which, persists, during, the, formation, of, adult, genital, sexuality, freud, argued, that, neurosis, and, perversion, could, be, explained, in, terms, of, fixation, or, regression, to, these, phases, whereas, adult, character, and, cultural, creativity, could, achieve, a, sublimation, of, their, perverse, residue, after, freud, s, later, development, of, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, this, normative, developmental, trajectory, becomes, formulated, in, terms, of, the, child, s, renunciation, of, incestuous, desires, under, the, fantasised, threat, of, or, fantasised, fact, of, in, the, case, of, the, girl, castration, the, dissolution, of, the, oedipus, complex, is, then, achieved, when, the, child, s, rivalrous, identification, with, the, parental, figure, is, transformed, into, the, pacifying, identifications, of, the, ego, ideal, which, assume, both, similarity, and, difference, and, acknowledge, the, separateness, and, autonomy, of, the, other, freud, hoped, to, prove, that, his, model, was, universally, valid, and, turned, to, ancient, mythology, and, contemporary, ethnography, for, comparative, material, arguing, that, totemism, reflected, a, ritualized, enactment, of, a, tribal, oedipal, conflict, freud, proposed, that, the, human, psyche, could, be, divided, into, three, parts, id, ego, and, super, ego, freud, discussed, this, model, in, the, 1920, essay, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, and, fully, elaborated, upon, it, in, the, ego, and, the, id, 1923, in, which, he, developed, it, as, an, alternative, to, his, previous, topographic, schema, i, e, conscious, unconscious, and, preconscious, the, id, is, the, unconscious, portion, of, the, psyche, that, operates, on, the, pleasure, principle, and, is, the, source, of, basic, impulses, and, drives, it, seeks, immediate, pleasure, and, gratification, freud, acknowledged, that, his, use, of, the, term, id, das, es, the, it, derives, from, the, writings, of, georg, groddeck, the, super, ego, is, the, moral, component, of, the, psyche, the, rational, ego, attempts, to, exact, a, balance, between, the, impractical, hedonism, of, the, id, and, the, equally, impractical, moralism, of, the, super, ego, it, is, the, part, of, the, psyche, that, is, usually, reflected, most, directly, in, a, person, s, actions, when, overburdened, or, threatened, by, its, tasks, it, may, employ, defence, mechanisms, including, denial, repression, undoing, rationalization, and, displacement, this, concept, is, usually, represented, by, the, iceberg, model, this, model, represents, the, roles, the, id, ego, and, super, ego, play, in, relation, to, conscious, and, unconscious, thought, freud, compared, the, relationship, between, the, ego, and, the, id, to, that, between, a, charioteer, and, his, horses, the, horses, provide, the, energy, and, drive, while, the, charioteer, provides, direction, freud, believed, that, the, human, psyche, is, subject, to, two, conflicting, drives, the, life, drive, or, libido, and, the, death, drive, the, life, drive, was, also, termed, eros, and, the, death, drive, thanatos, although, freud, did, not, use, the, latter, term, thanatos, was, introduced, in, this, context, by, paul, federn, freud, hypothesized, that, libido, is, a, form, of, mental, energy, with, which, processes, structures, and, object, representations, are, invested, in, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, 1920, freud, inferred, the, existence, of, a, death, drive, its, premise, was, a, regulatory, principle, that, has, been, described, as, the, principle, of, psychic, inertia, the, nirvana, principle, and, the, conservatism, of, instinct, its, background, was, freud, s, earlier, project, for, a, scientific, psychology, where, he, had, defined, the, principle, governing, the, mental, apparatus, as, its, tendency, to, divest, itself, of, quantity, or, to, reduce, tension, to, zero, freud, had, been, obliged, to, abandon, that, definition, since, it, proved, adequate, only, to, the, most, rudimentary, kinds, of, mental, functioning, and, replaced, the, idea, that, the, apparatus, tends, toward, a, level, of, zero, tension, with, the, idea, that, it, tends, toward, a, minimum, level, of, tension, freud, in, effect, readopted, the, original, definition, in, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, this, time, applying, it, to, a, different, principle, he, asserted, that, on, certain, occasions, the, mind, acts, as, though, it, could, eliminate, tension, or, in, effect, to, reduce, itself, to, a, state, of, extinction, his, key, evidence, for, this, was, the, existence, of, the, compulsion, to, repeat, examples, of, such, repetition, included, the, dream, life, of, traumatic, neurotics, and, children, s, play, in, the, phenomenon, of, repetition, freud, saw, a, psychic, trend, to, work, over, earlier, impressions, to, master, them, and, derive, pleasure, from, them, a, trend, that, was, before, the, pleasure, principle, but, not, opposed, to, it, in, addition, to, that, trend, there, was, also, a, principle, at, work, that, was, opposed, to, and, thus, beyond, the, pleasure, principle, if, repetition, is, a, necessary, element, in, the, binding, of, energy, or, adaptation, when, carried, to, inordinate, lengths, it, becomes, a, means, of, abandoning, adaptations, and, reinstating, earlier, or, less, evolved, psychic, positions, by, combining, this, idea, with, the, hypothesis, that, all, repetition, is, a, form, of, discharge, freud, concluded, that, the, compulsion, to, repeat, is, an, effort, to, restore, a, state, that, is, both, historically, primitive, and, marked, by, the, total, draining, of, energy, death, this, has, been, described, by, some, scholars, as, metaphysical, biology, in, his, 1917, essay, mourning, and, melancholia, freud, distinguished, mourning, painful, but, an, inevitable, part, of, life, and, melancholia, his, term, for, pathological, refusal, of, a, mourner, to, decathect, from, the, lost, one, freud, claimed, that, in, normal, mourning, the, ego, was, responsible, for, narcissistically, detaching, the, libido, from, the, lost, one, as, a, means, of, self, preservation, but, that, in, melancholia, prior, ambivalence, towards, the, lost, one, prevents, this, from, occurring, suicide, freud, hypothesized, could, result, in, extreme, cases, when, unconscious, feelings, of, conflict, became, directed, against, the, mourner, s, own, ego, freud, s, account, of, femininity, is, grounded, in, his, theory, of, psychic, development, as, it, traces, the, uneven, transition, from, the, earliest, stages, of, infantile, and, childhood, sexuality, characterised, by, polymorphous, perversity, and, a, bisexual, disposition, through, to, the, fantasy, scenarios, and, rivalrous, identifications, of, the, oedipus, complex, and, on, to, the, greater, or, lesser, extent, these, are, modified, in, adult, sexuality, there, are, different, trajectories, for, the, boy, and, the, girl, which, arise, as, effects, of, the, castration, complex, anatomical, difference, the, possession, of, a, penis, induces, castration, anxiety, for, the, boy, whereas, the, girl, experiences, a, sense, of, deprivation, in, the, boy, s, case, the, castration, complex, concludes, the, oedipal, phase, whereas, for, the, girl, it, precipitates, it, the, constraint, of, the, erotic, feelings, and, fantasies, of, the, girl, and, her, turning, away, from, the, mother, to, the, father, is, an, uneven, and, precarious, process, entailing, waves, of, repression, the, normal, outcome, is, according, to, freud, the, vagina, becoming, the, new, leading, zone, of, sexual, sensitivity, displacing, the, previously, dominant, clitoris, the, phallic, properties, of, which, made, it, indistinguishable, in, the, child, s, early, sexual, life, from, the, penis, this, leaves, a, legacy, of, penis, envy, and, emotional, ambivalence, for, the, girl, which, was, intimately, related, to, the, essence, of, femininity, and, leads, to, the, greater, proneness, of, women, to, neurosis, and, especially, hysteria, in, his, last, paper, on, the, topic, freud, likewise, concludes, that, the, development, of, femininity, remains, exposed, to, disturbance, by, the, residual, phenomena, of, the, early, masculine, period, some, portion, of, what, we, men, call, the, enigma, of, women, may, perhaps, be, derived, from, this, expression, of, bisexuality, in, women, s, lives, initiating, what, became, the, first, debate, within, psychoanalysis, on, femininity, karen, horney, of, the, berlin, psychoanalytic, institute, set, out, to, challenge, freud, s, account, of, femininity, rejecting, freud, s, theories, of, the, feminine, castration, complex, and, penis, envy, horney, argued, for, a, primary, femininity, and, penis, envy, as, a, defensive, formation, rather, than, arising, from, the, fact, or, injury, of, biological, asymmetry, as, freud, held, horney, had, the, influential, support, of, melanie, klein, and, ernest, jones, who, coined, the, term, phallocentrism, in, his, critique, of, freud, s, position, in, defending, freud, against, this, critique, feminist, scholar, jacqueline, rose, has, argued, that, it, presupposes, a, more, normative, account, of, female, sexual, development, than, that, given, by, freud, she, finds, that, freud, moved, from, a, description, of, the, little, girl, stuck, with, her, inferiority, or, injury, in, the, face, of, the, anatomy, of, the, little, boy, to, an, account, in, his, later, work, which, explicitly, describes, the, process, of, becoming, feminine, as, an, injury, or, catastrophe, for, the, complexity, of, her, earlier, psychic, and, sexual, life, throughout, his, deliberations, on, what, he, described, as, the, dark, continent, of, female, sexuality, and, the, riddle, of, femininity, freud, was, careful, to, emphasise, the, average, validity, and, provisional, nature, of, his, findings, he, did, however, in, response, to, his, critics, maintain, a, steadfast, objection, to, all, of, you, to, the, extent, that, you, do, not, distinguish, more, clearly, between, what, is, psychic, and, what, is, biological, freud, regarded, the, monotheistic, god, as, an, illusion, based, upon, the, infantile, emotional, need, for, a, powerful, supernatural, pater, familias, he, maintained, that, religion, once, necessary, to, restrain, man, s, violent, nature, in, the, early, stages, of, civilization, in, modern, times, can, be, set, aside, in, favor, of, reason, and, science, obsessive, actions, and, religious, practices, 1907, notes, the, likeness, between, faith, religious, belief, and, neurotic, obsession, totem, and, taboo, 1913, proposes, that, society, and, religion, begin, with, the, patricide, and, eating, of, the, powerful, paternal, figure, who, then, becomes, a, revered, collective, memory, in, the, future, of, an, illusion, 1927, freud, argues, that, the, function, of, religious, belief, is, psychological, consolation, he, argues, that, the, belief, in, a, supernatural, protector, serves, as, a, buffer, against, man, s, fear, of, nature, just, as, the, belief, in, an, afterlife, serves, as, a, buffer, against, man, s, fear, of, death, the, core, idea, of, the, work, is, that, religious, belief, can, be, explained, through, its, function, in, society, not, through, its, relation, to, the, truth, in, civilization, and, its, discontents, 1930, he, considers, the, oceanic, feeling, of, wholeness, limitlessness, and, eternity, brought, to, his, attention, by, his, friend, romain, rolland, as, a, possible, source, for, religious, feelings, he, notes, that, he, has, no, experience, of, this, feeling, himself, and, suggests, that, it, is, a, regression, into, the, state, of, consciousness, that, precedes, the, ego, s, differentiation, of, itself, from, the, world, of, objects, and, others, moses, and, monotheism, 1937, proposes, that, moses, was, the, tribal, pater, familias, killed, by, the,

rite, of, holy, communion, as, cultural, evidence, of, the, killing, and, devouring, of, the, sacred, father, moreover, he, perceived, religion, with, its, suppression, of, violence, as, mediator, of, the, societal, and, personal, the, public, and, the, private, conflicts, between, eros, and, thanatos, the, forces, of, life, and, death, later, works, indicate, freud, s, pessimism, about, the, future, of, civilization, which, he, noted, in, the, 1931, edition, of, civilization, and, its, discontents, humphrey, skelton, described, freud, s, worldview, as, one, of, stoical, humanism, the, humanist, heritage, project, summed, his, contributions, to, understanding, of, religion, by, saying, freud, s, ideas, on, the, origins, of, the, religious, impulse, and, the, comforting, illusion, religion, provided, were, a, significant, contribution, to, a, tradition, of, scientific, humanist, thought, in, which, research, and, reason, were, the, means, of, uncovering, truth, they, also, served, to, highlight, the, powerful, resonance, of, childhood, influences, on, adult, lives, not, least, in, the, realm, of, religion, in, a, footnote, of, his, 1909, analysis, of, a, phobia, in, a, five, year, old, boy, freud, theorized, that, the, universal, fear, of, castration, was, provoked, in, the, uncircumcised, when, they, perceived, circumcision, and, that, this, was, the, deepest, unconscious, root, of, antisemitism, freud, s, legacy, though, a, highly, contested, area, of, controversy, has, been, assessed, as, one, of, the, strongest, influences, on, twentieth, century, thought, its, impact, comparable, only, to, that, of, darwinism, and, marxism, with, its, range, of, influence, permeating, all, the, fields, of, culture, so, far, as, to, change, our, way, of, life, and, concept, of, man, though, not, the, first, methodology, in, the, practice, of, individual, verbal, psychotherapy, freud, s, psychoanalytic, system, came, to, dominate, the, field, from, early, in, the, twentieth, century, forming, the, basis, for, many, later, variants, while, these, systems, have, adopted, different, theories, and, techniques, all, have, followed, freud, by, attempting, to, achieve, psychic, and, behavioral, change, through, having, patients, talk, about, their, difficulties, psychoanalysis, is, not, as, influential, as, it, once, was, in, europe, and, the, united, states, though, in, some, parts, of, the, world, notably, latin, america, its, influence, in, the, later, 20th, century, expanded, substantially, psychoanalysis, also, remains, influential, within, many, contemporary, schools, of, psychotherapy, and, has, led, to, innovative, therapeutic, work, in, schools, and, with, families, and, groups, there, is, a, substantial, body, of, research, which, demonstrates, the, efficacy, of, the, clinical, methods, of, psychoanalysis, and, of, related, psychodynamic, therapies, in, treating, a, wide, range, of, psychological, disorders, the, neo, freudians, a, group, including, alfred, adler, otto, rank, karen, horney, harry, stack, sullivan, and, erich, fromm, rejected, freud, s, theory, of, instinctual, drive, emphasized, interpersonal, relations, and, self, assertiveness, and, made, modifications, to, therapeutic, practice, that, reflected, these, theoretical, shifts, the, neo, freudian, analysis, places, more, emphasis, on, the, patient, s, relationship, with, the, analyst, and, less, on, the, exploration, of, the, unconscious, jacques, lacan, approached, psychoanalysis, through, linguistics, and, literature, lacan, believed, that, most, of, freud, s, essential, work, had, been, done, before, 1905, and, that, ego, psychology, and, object, relations, theory, were, based, upon, misreadings, of, freud, s, work, lacan, saw, desire, as, more, important, than, need, wilhelm, reich, developed, some, of, freud, s, ideas, such, as, actualneurosis, freud, applied, that, idea, both, to, infants, and, to, adults, in, the, former, case, seductions, were, sought, as, the, causes, of, later, neuroses, and, in, the, latter, incomplete, sexual, release, unlike, freud, reich, retained, the, idea, that, actual, experience, especially, sexual, experience, was, of, key, significance, by, the, 1920s, reich, had, taken, freud, s, original, ideas, about, sexual, release, to, the, point, of, specifying, the, orgasm, as, the, criteria, of, healthy, function, reich, was, also, developing, his, ideas, about, character, into, a, form, that, would, later, take, shape, first, as, muscular, armour, and, eventually, as, a, transducer, of, universal, biological, energy, the, orgone, fritz, perls, who, helped, to, develop, gestalt, therapy, was, influenced, by, reich, jung, and, freud, the, key, idea, of, gestalt, therapy, is, that, freud, overlooked, the, structure, of, awareness, an, active, process, that, moves, toward, the, construction, of, organized, meaningful, wholes, between, an, organism, and, its, environment, these, wholes, called, gestalts, are, patterns, involving, all, the, layers, of, organismic, function, thought, feeling, and, activity, to, which, improper, formation, in, perls, view, gives, rise, to, neurosis, and, anxieties, gestalt, therapy, attempts, to, cure, patients, by, placing, them, in, contact, with, immediate, organismic, needs, perls, rejected, the, verbal, approach, of, classical, psychoanalysis, favoring, a, workshop, style, approach, arthur, janov, s, primal, therapy, which, has, been, influential, post, freudian, psychotherapy, resembles, psychoanalytic, therapy, in, its, emphasis, on, early, childhood, experience, but, has, also, differences, with, it, while, janov, s, theory, is, akin, to, freud, s, early, idea, of, actualneurosis, he, does, not, have, a, dynamic, psychology, but, a, nature, psychology, like, that, of, reich, or, perls, in, which, need, is, primary, while, wish, is, derivative, and, dispensable, when, need, is, met, despite, its, surface, similarity, to, freud, s, ideas, janov, s, theory, lacks, a, strictly, psychological, account, of, the, unconscious, and, belief, in, infantile, sexuality, while, for, freud, there, was, a, hierarchy, of, dangerous, situations, for, janov, the, key, event, in, the, child, s, life, is, an, awareness, that, the, parents, do, not, love, it, janov, writes, in, the, primal, scream, 1970, that, primal, therapy, has, in, some, ways, returned, to, freud, s, early, ideas, and, techniques, ellen, bass, and, laura, davis, co, authors, of, the, courage, to, heal, 1988, are, described, as, champions, of, survivorship, by, frederick, crews, who, considers, freud, the, key, influence, upon, them, although, in, his, view, they, are, indebted, not, to, classic, psychoanalysis, but, to, the, pre, psychoanalytic, freud, who, supposedly, took, pity, on, his, hysterical, patients, found, that, they, were, all, harboring, memories, of, early, abuse, and, cured, them, by, unknotting, their, repression, crews, sees, freud, as, having, anticipated, the, recovered, memory, movement, by, emphasizing, mechanical, cause, and, effect, relations, between, symptomatology, and, the, premature, stimulation, of, one, body, zone, or, another, and, with, pioneering, its, technique, of, thematically, matching, a, patient, s, symptom, with, a, sexually, symmetrical, memory, crews, believes, that, freud, s, confidence, in, accurate, recall, of, early, memories, anticipates, the, theories, of, recovered, memory, therapists, such, as, lenore, terr, which, in, his, view, have, led, to, people, being, wrongfully, imprisoned, research, projects, designed, to, test, freud, s, theories, empirically, have, led, to, a, vast, literature, on, the, topic, american, psychologists, began, to, attempt, to, study, repression, in, the, experimental, laboratory, around, 1930, in, 1934, when, the, psychologist, saul, rosenzweig, sent, freud, reprints, of, his, attempts, to, study, repression, freud, responded, with, a, dismissive, letter, stating, that, the, wealth, of, reliable, observations, on, which, psychoanalytic, assertions, were, based, made, them, independent, of, experimental, verification, seymour, fisher, and, roger, p, greenberg, concluded, in, 1977, that, some, of, freud, s, concepts, were, supported, by, empirical, evidence, their, analysis, of, research, literature, supported, freud, s, concepts, of, oral, and, anal, personality, constellations, his, account, of, the, role, of, oedipal, factors, in, certain, aspects, of, male, personality, functioning, his, formulations, about, the, relatively, greater, concern, about, the, loss, of, love, in, women, s, as, compared, to, men, s, personality, economy, and, his, views, about, the, instigating, effects, of, homosexual, anxieties, on, the, formation, of, paranoid, delusions, they, also, found, limited, and, equivocal, support, for, freud, s, theories, about, the, development, of, homosexuality, they, found, that, several, of, freud, s, other, theories, including, his, portrayal, of, dreams, as, primarily, containers, of, secret, unconscious, wishes, as, well, as, some, of, his, views, about, the, psychodynamics, of, women, were, either, not, supported, or, contradicted, by, research, reviewing, the, issues, again, in, 1996, they, concluded, that, much, experimental, data, relevant, to, freud, s, work, exists, and, supports, some, of, his, major, ideas, and, theories, other, viewpoints, include, those, of, psychologist, and, science, historian, malcolm, macmillan, who, concludes, in, freud, evaluated, 1991, that, freud, s, method, is, not, capable, of, yielding, objective, data, about, mental, processes, morris, eagle, states, that, it, has, been, demonstrated, quite, conclusively, that, because, of, the, epistemologically, contaminated, status, of, clinical, data, derived, from, the, clinical, situation, such, data, have, questionable, probative, value, in, the, testing, of, psychoanalytic, hypotheses, richard, webster, in, why, freud, was, wrong, 1995, described, psychoanalysis, as, perhaps, the, most, complex, and, successful, pseudoscience, in, history, crews, believes, that, psychoanalysis, has, no, scientific, or, therapeutic, merit, university, of, chicago, research, associate, kurt, jacobsen, takes, these, critics, to, task, for, their, own, supposedly, dogmatic, and, historically, naive, views, both, about, psychoanalysis, and, the, nature, of, science, i, b, cohen, regards, freud, s, interpretation, of, dreams, as, a, revolutionary, work, of, science, the, last, such, work, to, be, published, in, book, form, in, contrast, allan, hobson, believes, that, freud, by, rhetorically, discrediting, 19th, century, investigators, of, dreams, such, as, alfred, maury, and, the, marquis, de, hervey, de, saint, denis, at, a, time, when, study, of, the, physiology, of, the, brain, was, only, beginning, interrupted, the, development, of, scientific, dream, theory, for, half, a, century, the, dream, researcher, g, william, domhoff, has, disputed, claims, of, freudian, dream, theory, being, validated, karl, popper, claimed, that, freud, s, psychoanalytic, theories, were, presented, in, unfalsifiable, form, meaning, that, no, experiment, could, ever, disprove, them, the, philosopher, adolf, gr, nbaum, argues, in, the, foundations, of, psychoanalysis, 1984, that, popper, was, mistaken, and, that, many, of, freud, s, theories, are, empirically, testable, a, position, with, which, others, such, as, eysenck, agree, the, philosopher, roger, scruton, writing, in, sexual, desire, 1986, also, rejected, popper, s, arguments, pointing, to, the, theory, of, repression, as, an, example, of, a, freudian, theory, that, does, have, testable, consequences, scruton, nevertheless, concluded, that, psychoanalysis, is, not, genuinely, scientific, because, it, involves, an, unacceptable, dependence, on, metaphor, the, philosopher, donald, levy, agrees, with, gr, nbaum, that, freud, s, theories, are, falsifiable, but, disputes, gr, nbaum, s, contention, that, therapeutic, success, is, only, the, empirical, basis, on, which, they, stand, or, fall, arguing, that, a, much, wider, range, of, empirical, evidence, can, be, adduced, via, clinical, case, material, in, a, study, of, psychoanalysis, in, the, united, states, nathan, hale, reported, on, the, decline, of, psychoanalysis, in, psychiatry, during, 1965, 1985, the, continuation, of, this, trend, was, noted, by, alan, stone, as, academic, psychology, becomes, more, scientific, and, psychiatry, more, biological, psychoanalysis, is, being, brushed, aside, paul, stepansky, while, noting, that, psychoanalysis, remains, influential, in, the, humanities, records, the, vanishingly, small, number, of, psychiatric, residents, who, choose, to, pursue, psychoanalytic, training, and, the, nonanalytic, backgrounds, of, psychiatric, chairpersons, at, major, universities, among, the, evidence, he, cites, for, his, conclusion, that, such, historical, trends, attest, to, the, marginalisation, of, psychoanalysis, within, american, psychiatry, nonetheless, freud, was, ranked, as, the, third, most, cited, psychologist, of, the, 20th, century, it, is, also, claimed, that, in, moving, beyond, the, orthodoxy, of, the, not, so, distant, past, new, ideas, and, new, research, has, led, to, an, intense, reawakening, of, interest, in, psychoanalysis, from, neighbouring, disciplines, ranging, from, the, humanities, to, neuroscience, and, including, the, non, analytic, therapies, research, in, the, emerging, field, of, neuropsychoanalysis, founded, by, neuroscientist, and, psychoanalyst, mark, solms, has, proved, controversial, with, some, psychoanalysts, criticising, the, very, concept, itself, solms, and, his, colleagues, have, argued, for, neuro, scientific, findings, being, broadly, consistent, with, freudian, theories, pointing, out, brain, structures, relating, to, freudian, concepts, such, as, libido, drives, the, unconscious, and, repression, neuroscientists, who, have, endorsed, freud, s, work, include, david, eagleman, who, believes, that, freud, transformed, psychiatry, by, providing, the, first, exploration, of, the, way, in, which, hidden, states, of, the, brain, participate, in, driving, thought, and, behavior, and, nobel, laureate, eric, kandel, who, argues, that, psychoanalysis, still, represents, the, most, coherent, and, intellectually, satisfying, view, of, the, mind, psychoanalysis, has, been, interpreted, as, both, radical, and, conservative, by, the, 1940s, it, had, come, to, be, seen, as, conservative, by, the, european, and, american, intellectual, community, critics, outside, the, psychoanalytic, movement, whether, on, the, political, left, or, right, saw, freud, as, a, conservative, fromm, had, argued, that, several, aspects, of, psychoanalytic, theory, served, the, interests, of, political, reaction, in, his, the, fear, of, freedom, 1942, an, assessment, confirmed, by, sympathetic, writers, on, the, right, in, freud, the, mind, of, the, moralist, 1959, philip, rieff, portrayed, freud, as, a, man, who, urged, men, to, make, the, best, of, an, inevitably, unhappy, fate, and, admirable, for, that, reason, in, the, 1950s, herbert, marcuse, challenged, the, then, prevailing, interpretation, of, freud, as, a, conservative, in, eros, and, civilization, 1955, as, did, lionel, trilling, in, freud, and, the, crisis, of, our, culture, and, norman, o, brown, in, life, against, death, 1959, eros, and, civilization, helped, make, the, idea, that, freud, and, karl, marx, were, addressing, similar, questions, from, different, perspectives, credible, to, the, left, marcuse, criticized, neo, freudian, revisionism, for, discarding, seemingly, pessimistic, theories, such, as, the, death, instinct, arguing, that, they, could, be, turned, in, a, utopian, direction, freud, s, theories, also, influenced, the, frankfurt, school, and, critical, theory, as, a, whole, freud, has, been, compared, to, marx, by, reich, who, saw, freud, s, importance, for, psychiatry, as, parallel, to, that, of, marx, for, economics, and, by, paul, robinson, who, sees, freud, as, a, revolutionary, whose, contributions, to, twentieth, century, thought, are, comparable, in, importance, to, marx, s, contributions, to, the, nineteenth, century, thought, fromm, calls, freud, marx, and, einstein, the, architects, of, the, modern, age, but, rejects, the, idea, that, marx, and, freud, were, equally, significant, arguing, that, marx, was, both, far, more, historically, important, and, a, finer, thinker, fromm, nevertheless, credits, freud, with, permanently, changing, the, way, human, nature, is, understood, gilles, deleuze, and, f, lix, guattari, write, in, anti, oedipus, 1972, that, psychoanalysis, resembles, the, russian, revolution, in, that, it, became, corrupted, almost, from, the, beginning, they, believe, this, began, with, freud, s, development, of, the, theory, of, the, oedipus, complex, which, they, see, as, idealist, jean, paul, sartre, critiques, freud, s, theory, of, the, unconscious, in, being, and, nothingness, 1943, claiming, that, consciousness, is, essentially, self, conscious, maurice, merleau, ponty, considers, freud, to, be, one, of, the, anticipators, of, phenomenology, while, theodor, w, adorno, considers, edmund, husserl, the, founder, of, phenomenology, to, be, freud, s, philosophical, opposite, writing, that, husserl, s, polemic, against, psychologism, could, have, been, directed, against, psychoanalysis, paul, ric, ur, sees, freud, as, one, of, the, three, masters, of, suspicion, alongside, marx, and, nietzsche, for, their, unmasking, the, lies, and, illusions, of, consciousness, ric, ur, and, j, rgen, habermas, have, helped, create, a, hermeneutic, version, of, freud, one, which, claimed, him, as, the, most, significant, progenitor, of, the, shift, from, an, objectifying, empiricist, understanding, of, the, human, realm, to, one, stressing, subjectivity, and, interpretation, louis, althusser, drew, on, freud, s, concept, of, overdetermination, for, his, reinterpretation, of, marx, s, capital, jean, fran, ois, lyotard, developed, a, theory, of, the, unconscious, that, reverses, freud, s, account, of, the, dream, work, several, scholars, see, freud, as, parallel, to, plato, writing, that, they, hold, nearly, the, same, theory, of, dreams, and, have, similar, theories, of, the, tripartite, structure, of, the, human, soul, or, personality, even, if, the, hierarchy, between, the, parts, of, the, soul, is, almost, reversed, ernest, gellner, argues, that, freud, s, theories, are, an, inversion, of, plato, s, whereas, plato, saw, a, hierarchy, inherent, in, the, nature, of, reality, and, relied, upon, it, to, validate, norms, freud, was, a, naturalist, who, could, not, follow, such, an, approach, both, men, s, theories, drew, a, parallel, between, the, structure, of, the, human, mind, and, that, of, society, but, while, plato, wanted, to, strengthen, the, super, ego, which, gellner, compared, to, the, aristocracy, freud, wanted, to, strengthen, the, ego, which, corresponded, to, the, middle, class, paul, vitz, compares, freudian, psychoanalysis, to, thomism, noting, st, thomas, s, belief, in, the, existence, of, an, unconscious, consciousness, and, his, frequent, use, of, the, word, and, concept, libido, sometimes, in, a, more, specific, sense, than, freud, but, always, in, a, manner, in, agreement, with, the, freudian, use, vitz, suggests, that, freud, may, have, been, unaware, his, theory, of, the, unconscious, was, reminiscent, of, aquinas, the, poem, in, memory, of, sigmund, freud, was, published, by, w, h, auden, in, his, 1940, collection, another, time, auden, describes, freud, as, having, created, a, whole, climate, of, opinion, under, whom, we, conduct, our, different, lives, literary, critic, harold, bloom, has, been, influenced, by, freud, camille, paglia, has, also, been, influenced, by, freud, whom, she, calls, nietzsche, s, heir, and, one, of, the, greatest, sexual, psychologists, in, literature, but, has, rejected, the, scientific, status, of, his, work, in, her, sexual, personae, 1990, writing, freud, has, no, rivals, among, his, successors, because, they, think, he, wrote, science, when, in, fact, he, wrote, art, the, decline, in, freud, s, reputation, has, been, attributed, partly, to, the, revival, of, feminism, simone, de, beauvoir, criticizes, psychoanalysis, from, an, existentialist, standpoint, in, the, second, sex, 1949, arguing, that, freud, saw, an, original, superiority, in, the, male, that, is, in, reality, socially, induced, betty, friedan, criticizes, freud, and, what, she, considered, his, victorian, view, of, women, in, the, feminine, mystique, 1963, freud, s, concept, of, penis, envy, was, attacked, by, kate, millett, who, in, sexual, politics, 1970, accused, him, of, confusion, and, oversights, in, 1968, anne, koedt, wrote, in, her, essay, the, myth, of, the, vaginal, orgasm, it, was, freud, s, feelings, about, women, s, secondary, and, inferior, relationship, to, men, that, formed, the, basis, for, his, theories, on, female, sexuality, once, having, laid, down, the, law, about, the, nature, of, our, sexuality, freud, not, so, strangely, discovered, a, tremendous, problem, of, frigidity, in, women, his, recommended, cure, for, a, frigid, woman, was, psychiatric, care, she, was, suffering, from, failure, to, mentally, adjust, to, her, natural, role, as, a, woman, naomi, weisstein, writes, that, freud, and, his, followers, erroneously, thought, his, years, of, intensive, clinical, experience, added, up, to, scientific, rigor, freud, is, also, criticized, by, shulamith, firestone, and, eva, figes, in, the, dialectic, of, sex, 1970, firestone, argues, that, freud, was, a, poet, who, produced, metaphors, rather, than, literal, truths, in, her, view, freud, like, feminists, recognized, that, sexuality, was, the, crucial, problem, of, modern, life, but, ignored, the, social, context, firestone, interprets, freud, s, metaphors, in, terms, of, the, facts, of, power, within, the, family, figes, tries, in, patriarchal, attitudes, 1970, to, place, freud, within, a, history, of, ideas, juliet, mitchell, defends, freud, against, his, feminist, critics, in, psychoanalysis, and, feminism, 1974, accusing, them, of, misreading, him, and, misunderstanding, the, implications, of, psychoanalytic, theory, for, feminism, mitchell, helped, introduce, english, speaking, feminists, to, lacan, mitchell, is, criticized, by, jane, gallop, in, the, daughter, s, seduction, 1982, gallop, compliments, mitchell, for, her, criticism, of, feminist, discussions, of, freud, but, finds, her, treatment, of, lacanian, theory, lacking, some, french, feminists, among, them, julia, kristeva, and, luce, irigaray, have, been, influenced, by, freud, as, interpreted, by, lacan, psychologist, carol, gilligan, writes, that, the, penchant, of, developmental, theorists, to, project, a, masculine, image, and, one, that, appears, frightening, to, women, goes, back, at, least, to, freud, she, sees, freud, s, criticism, of, women, s, sense, of, justice, reappearing, in, the, work, of, jean, piaget, and, lawrence, kohlberg, gilligan, notes, that, nancy, chodorow, in, contrast, to, freud, attributes, sexual, difference, not, to, anatomy, but, to, the, fact, that, male, and, female, children, have, different, early, social, environments, chodorow, writing, against, the, masculine, bias, of, psychoanalysis, replaces, freud, s, negative, and, derivative, description, of, female, psychology, with, a, positive, and, direct, account, of, her, own, in, her, analysis, of, freud, s, work, on, religion, in, relation, to, gender, judith, van, herik, noted, that, freud, paired, femininity, and, the, concept, of, weakness, with, christianity, and, wish, fulfillment, while, associating, masculinity, and, renunciation, with, judaism, toril, moi, has, developed, a, feminist, perspective, on, psychoanalysis, proposing, that, it, is, a, discourse, that, attempts, to, understand, the, psychic, consequences, of, three, universal, traumas, the, fact, that, there, are, others, the, fact, of, sexual, difference, and, the, fact, of, death, she, replaces, freud, s, term, of, castration, with, stanley, cavell, s, concept, of, victimization, which, is, a, more, universal, term, that, applies, equally, to, both, sexes, moi, regards, this, concept, of, human, finitude, as, a, suitable, replacement, for, both, castration, and, sexual, difference, as, the, traumatic, discovery, of, our, separate, sexed, mortal, existence, and, how, both, men, and, women, come, to, terms, with, it, sigmund, freud, is, the, subject, of, three, major, films, or, tv, series, the, first, of, which, was, 1962, s, freud, the, secret, passion, starring, montgomery, clift, as, freud, directed, by, john, huston, from, a, revision, of, a, script, by, an, uncredited, jean, paul, sartre, the, film, is, focused, on, freud, s, early, life, from, 1885, to, 1890, and, combines, multiple, case, studies, of, freud, into, single, ones, and, multiple, friends, of, his, into, single, characters, in, 1984, the, bbc, produced, the, six, episode, mini, series, freud, the, life, of, a, dream, starring, david, suchet, the, stage, play, the, talking, cure, and,

most, dangerous, method, by, john, kerr, viggo, mortensen, plays, freud, and, michael, fassbender, plays, jung, more, fanciful, employments, of, freud, in, fiction, are, the, seven, per, cent, solution, by, nicholas, meyer, which, centers, on, an, encounter, between, freud, and, the, fictional, detective, sherlock, holmes, with, a, main, part, of, the, plot, seeing, freud, helping, holmes,
