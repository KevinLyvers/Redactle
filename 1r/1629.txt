albert, einstein, a, n, s, t, a, n, eyen, styne, german, 14, march, 1879, 18, april, 1955, was, a, german, born, theoretical, physicist, who, is, widely, held, as, one, of, the, most, influential, scientists, best, known, for, developing, the, theory, of, relativity, einstein, also, made, important, contributions, to, quantum, mechanics, his, mass, energy, equivalence, formula, e, mc, 2, which, arises, from, special, relativity, has, been, called, the, world, s, most, famous, equation, he, received, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, services, to, theoretical, physics, and, especially, for, his, discovery, of, the, law, of, the, photoelectric, effect, a, pivotal, step, in, the, development, of, quantum, theory, born, in, the, german, empire, einstein, moved, to, switzerland, in, 1895, forsaking, his, german, citizenship, as, a, subject, of, the, kingdom, of, w, rttemberg, the, following, year, in, 1897, at, the, age, of, seventeen, he, enrolled, in, the, mathematics, and, physics, teaching, diploma, program, at, the, swiss, federal, polytechnic, school, in, z, rich, graduating, in, 1900, in, 1901, he, acquired, swiss, citizenship, which, he, kept, for, the, rest, of, his, life, in, 1903, he, secured, a, permanent, position, at, the, swiss, patent, office, in, bern, in, 1905, he, submitted, a, successful, phd, dissertation, to, the, university, of, zurich, in, 1914, he, moved, to, berlin, in, order, to, join, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, and, the, humboldt, university, of, berlin, in, 1917, he, became, director, of, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, he, also, became, a, german, citizen, again, this, time, as, a, subject, of, the, kingdom, of, prussia, in, 1933, while, einstein, was, visiting, the, united, states, adolf, hitler, came, to, power, in, germany, horrified, by, the, nazi, war, of, extermination, against, his, fellow, jews, einstein, decided, to, remain, in, the, us, and, was, granted, american, citizenship, in, 1940, on, the, eve, of, world, war, ii, he, endorsed, a, letter, to, president, franklin, d, roosevelt, alerting, him, to, the, potential, german, nuclear, weapons, program, and, recommended, that, the, us, begin, similar, research, einstein, supported, the, allies, but, generally, viewed, the, idea, of, nuclear, weapons, with, great, dismay, einstein, s, work, is, also, known, for, its, influence, on, the, philosophy, of, science, in, 1905, he, published, four, groundbreaking, papers, sometimes, described, as, his, annus, mirabilis, miracle, year, these, papers, outlined, a, theory, of, the, photoelectric, effect, explained, brownian, motion, introduced, his, special, theory, of, relativity, a, theory, which, addressed, the, inability, of, classical, mechanics, to, account, satisfactorily, for, the, behavior, of, the, electromagnetic, field, and, demonstrated, that, if, the, special, theory, is, correct, mass, and, energy, are, equivalent, to, each, other, in, 1915, he, proposed, a, general, theory, of, relativity, that, extended, his, system, of, mechanics, to, incorporate, gravitation, a, cosmological, paper, that, he, published, the, following, year, laid, out, the, implications, of, general, relativity, for, the, modeling, of, the, structure, and, evolution, of, the, universe, as, a, whole, in, the, middle, part, of, his, career, einstein, made, important, contributions, to, statistical, mechanics, and, quantum, theory, especially, notable, was, his, work, on, the, quantum, physics, of, radiation, in, which, light, consists, of, particles, subsequently, called, photons, with, the, indian, physicist, satyendra, nath, bose, he, laid, the, groundwork, for, bose, einstein, statistics, for, much, of, the, last, phase, of, his, academic, life, einstein, worked, on, two, endeavors, that, proved, ultimately, unsuccessful, first, he, advocated, against, quantum, theory, s, introduction, of, fundamental, randomness, into, science, s, picture, of, the, world, objecting, that, god, does, not, play, dice, second, he, attempted, to, devise, a, unified, field, theory, by, generalizing, his, geometric, theory, of, gravitation, to, include, electromagnetism, too, as, a, result, he, became, increasingly, isolated, from, the, mainstream, modern, physics, his, intellectual, achievements, and, originality, made, einstein, broadly, synonymous, with, genius, in, 1999, he, was, named, time, s, person, of, the, century, in, a, 1999, poll, of, 130, leading, physicists, worldwide, by, the, british, journal, physics, world, einstein, was, ranked, the, greatest, physicist, of, all, time, albert, einstein, was, born, in, ulm, in, the, kingdom, of, w, rttemberg, in, the, german, empire, on, 14, march, 1879, his, parents, secular, ashkenazi, jews, were, hermann, einstein, a, salesman, and, engineer, and, pauline, koch, in, 1880, the, family, moved, to, munich, s, borough, of, ludwigsvorstadt, isarvorstadt, where, einstein, s, father, and, his, uncle, jakob, founded, elektrotechnische, fabrik, j, einstein, cie, a, company, that, manufactured, electrical, equipment, based, on, direct, current, he, often, related, a, formative, event, from, his, youth, when, he, was, sick, in, bed, and, his, father, brought, him, a, compass, this, sparked, his, lifelong, fascination, with, electromagnetism, he, realized, that, something, deeply, hidden, had, to, be, behind, things, albert, attended, st, peter, s, catholic, elementary, school, in, munich, from, the, age, of, five, when, he, was, eight, he, was, transferred, to, the, luitpold, gymnasium, where, he, received, advanced, primary, and, then, secondary, school, education, in, 1894, hermann, and, jakob, s, company, tendered, for, a, contract, to, install, electric, lighting, in, munich, but, without, success, they, lacked, the, capital, that, would, have, been, required, to, update, their, technology, from, direct, current, to, the, more, efficient, alternating, current, alternative, the, failure, of, their, bid, forced, them, to, sell, their, munich, factory, and, search, for, new, opportunities, elsewhere, the, einstein, family, moved, to, italy, first, to, milan, and, a, few, months, later, to, pavia, where, they, settled, in, palazzo, cornazzani, einstein, then, fifteen, stayed, behind, in, munich, in, order, to, finish, his, schooling, his, father, wanted, him, to, study, electrical, engineering, but, he, was, a, fractious, pupil, who, found, the, gymnasium, s, regimen, and, teaching, methods, far, from, congenial, he, later, wrote, that, the, school, s, policy, of, strict, rote, learning, was, harmful, to, creativity, at, the, end, of, december, 1894, a, letter, from, a, doctor, persuaded, the, luitpold, s, authorities, to, release, him, from, its, care, and, he, joined, his, family, in, pavia, while, in, italy, as, a, teenager, he, wrote, an, essay, entitled, on, the, investigation, of, the, state, of, the, ether, in, a, magnetic, field, einstein, excelled, at, physics, and, mathematics, from, an, early, age, and, soon, acquired, the, mathematical, expertise, normally, only, found, in, a, child, several, years, his, senior, he, began, teaching, himself, algebra, calculus, and, euclidean, geometry, when, he, was, twelve, he, made, such, rapid, progress, that, he, discovered, an, original, proof, of, the, pythagorean, theorem, before, his, thirteenth, birthday, a, family, tutor, max, talmud, said, that, only, a, short, time, after, he, had, given, the, twelve, year, old, einstein, a, geometry, textbook, the, boy, had, worked, through, the, whole, book, he, thereupon, devoted, himself, to, higher, mathematics, soon, the, flight, of, his, mathematical, genius, was, so, high, i, could, not, follow, einstein, recorded, that, he, had, mastered, integral, and, differential, calculus, while, still, just, fourteen, his, love, of, algebra, and, geometry, was, so, great, that, at, twelve, he, was, already, confident, that, nature, could, be, understood, as, a, mathematical, structure, at, thirteen, when, his, range, of, enthusiasms, had, broadened, to, include, music, and, philosophy, talmud, introduced, einstein, to, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, kant, became, his, favorite, philosopher, according, to, talmud, at, the, time, he, was, still, a, child, only, thirteen, years, old, yet, kant, s, works, incomprehensible, to, ordinary, mortals, seemed, to, be, clear, to, him, in, 1895, at, the, age, of, sixteen, einstein, sat, the, entrance, examination, for, the, federal, polytechnic, school, later, the, eidgen, ssische, technische, hochschule, eth, in, z, rich, switzerland, he, failed, to, reach, the, required, standard, in, the, general, part, of, the, test, but, performed, with, distinction, in, physics, and, mathematics, on, the, advice, of, the, polytechnic, s, principal, he, completed, his, secondary, education, at, the, argovian, cantonal, school, a, gymnasium, in, aarau, switzerland, graduating, in, 1896, while, lodging, in, aarau, with, the, family, of, jost, winteler, he, fell, in, love, with, winteler, s, daughter, marie, his, sister, maja, later, married, winteler, s, son, paul, in, january, 1896, with, his, father, s, approval, einstein, renounced, his, citizenship, of, the, german, kingdom, of, w, rttemberg, in, order, to, avoid, conscription, into, military, service, the, matura, graduation, for, the, successful, completion, of, higher, secondary, schooling, awarded, to, him, in, september, 1896, acknowledged, him, to, have, performed, well, across, most, of, the, curriculum, allotting, him, a, top, grade, of, 6, for, history, physics, algebra, geometry, and, descriptive, geometry, at, seventeen, he, enrolled, in, the, four, year, mathematics, and, physics, teaching, diploma, program, at, the, federal, polytechnic, school, marie, winteler, a, year, older, than, him, took, up, a, teaching, post, in, olsberg, switzerland, the, five, other, polytechnic, school, freshmen, following, the, same, course, as, einstein, included, just, one, woman, a, twenty, year, old, serbian, mileva, mari, over, the, next, few, years, the, pair, spent, many, hours, discussing, their, shared, interests, and, learning, about, topics, in, physics, that, the, polytechnic, school, s, lectures, did, not, cover, in, his, letters, to, mari, einstein, confessed, that, exploring, science, with, her, by, his, side, was, much, more, enjoyable, than, reading, a, textbook, in, solitude, eventually, the, two, students, became, not, only, friends, but, also, lovers, historians, of, physics, are, divided, on, the, question, of, the, extent, to, which, mari, contributed, to, the, insights, of, einstein, s, annus, mirabilis, publications, there, is, at, least, some, evidence, that, he, was, influenced, by, her, scientific, ideas, but, there, are, scholars, who, doubt, whether, her, impact, on, his, thought, was, of, any, great, significance, at, all, correspondence, between, einstein, and, mari, discovered, and, published, in, 1987, revealed, that, in, early, 1902, while, mari, was, visiting, her, parents, in, novi, sad, she, gave, birth, to, a, daughter, lieserl, when, mari, returned, to, switzerland, it, was, without, the, child, whose, fate, is, uncertain, a, letter, of, einstein, s, that, he, wrote, in, september, 1903, suggests, that, the, girl, was, either, given, up, for, adoption, or, died, of, scarlet, fever, in, infancy, einstein, and, mari, married, in, january, 1903, in, may, 1904, their, son, hans, albert, was, born, in, bern, switzerland, their, son, eduard, was, born, in, z, rich, in, july, 1910, in, letters, that, einstein, wrote, to, marie, winteler, in, the, months, before, eduard, s, arrival, he, described, his, love, for, his, wife, as, misguided, and, mourned, the, missed, life, that, he, imagined, he, would, have, enjoyed, if, he, had, married, winteler, instead, i, think, of, you, in, heartfelt, love, every, spare, minute, and, am, so, unhappy, as, only, a, man, can, be, in, 1912, einstein, entered, into, a, relationship, with, elsa, l, wenthal, who, was, both, his, first, cousin, on, his, mother, s, side, and, his, second, cousin, on, his, father, s, when, mari, learned, of, his, infidelity, soon, after, moving, to, berlin, with, him, in, april, 1914, she, returned, to, z, rich, taking, hans, albert, and, eduard, with, her, einstein, and, mari, were, granted, a, divorce, on, 14, february, 1919, on, the, grounds, of, having, lived, apart, for, five, years, as, part, of, the, divorce, settlement, einstein, agreed, that, if, he, were, to, win, a, nobel, prize, he, would, give, the, money, that, he, received, to, mari, he, won, the, prize, two, years, later, einstein, married, l, wenthal, in, 1919, in, 1923, he, began, a, relationship, with, a, secretary, named, betty, neumann, the, niece, of, his, close, friend, hans, m, hsam, l, wenthal, nevertheless, remained, loyal, to, him, accompanying, him, when, he, emigrated, to, the, united, states, in, 1933, in, 1935, she, was, diagnosed, with, heart, and, kidney, problems, she, died, in, december, 1936, a, volume, of, einstein, s, letters, released, by, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, in, 2006, added, further, names, to, the, catalog, of, women, with, whom, he, was, romantically, involved, they, included, margarete, lebach, a, married, austrian, estella, katzenellenbogen, the, rich, owner, of, a, florist, business, toni, mendel, a, wealthy, jewish, widow, and, ethel, michanowski, a, berlin, socialite, with, whom, he, spent, time, and, from, whom, he, accepted, gifts, while, married, to, l, wenthal, after, being, widowed, einstein, was, briefly, in, a, relationship, with, margarita, konenkova, thought, by, some, to, be, a, russian, spy, her, husband, the, russian, sculptor, sergei, konenkov, created, the, bronze, bust, of, einstein, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, at, princeton, following, an, episode, of, acute, mental, illness, at, about, the, age, of, twenty, einstein, s, son, eduard, was, diagnosed, with, schizophrenia, he, spent, the, remainder, of, his, life, either, in, the, care, of, his, mother, or, in, temporary, confinement, in, an, asylum, after, her, death, he, was, committed, permanently, to, burgh, lzli, the, psychiatric, university, hospital, in, z, rich, einstein, graduated, from, the, federal, polytechnic, school, in, 1900, duly, certified, as, competent, to, teach, mathematics, and, physics, his, successful, acquisition, of, swiss, citizenship, in, february, 1901, was, not, followed, by, the, usual, sequel, of, conscription, the, swiss, authorities, deemed, him, medically, unfit, for, military, service, he, found, that, swiss, schools, too, appeared, to, have, no, use, for, him, failing, to, offer, him, a, teaching, position, despite, the, almost, two, years, that, he, spent, applying, for, one, eventually, it, was, with, the, help, of, marcel, grossmann, s, father, that, he, secured, a, post, in, bern, at, the, swiss, patent, office, as, an, assistant, examiner, level, iii, patent, applications, that, landed, on, einstein, s, desk, for, his, evaluation, included, ideas, for, a, gravel, sorter, and, an, electric, typewriter, his, employers, were, pleased, enough, with, his, work, to, make, his, position, permanent, in, 1903, although, they, did, not, think, that, he, should, be, promoted, until, he, had, fully, mastered, machine, technology, it, is, conceivable, that, his, labors, at, the, patent, office, had, a, bearing, on, his, development, of, his, special, theory, of, relativity, he, arrived, at, his, revolutionary, ideas, about, space, time, and, light, through, thought, experiments, about, the, transmission, of, signals, and, the, synchronization, of, clocks, matters, which, also, figured, in, some, of, the, inventions, submitted, to, him, for, assessment, in, 1902, einstein, and, some, friends, whom, he, had, met, in, bern, formed, a, group, that, held, regular, meetings, to, discuss, science, and, philosophy, their, choice, of, a, name, for, their, club, the, olympia, academy, was, an, ironic, comment, upon, its, far, from, olympian, status, sometimes, they, were, joined, by, mari, who, limited, her, participation, in, their, proceedings, to, careful, listening, the, thinkers, whose, works, they, reflected, upon, included, henri, poincar, ernst, mach, and, david, hume, all, of, whom, significantly, influenced, einstein, s, own, subsequent, ideas, and, beliefs, einstein, s, first, paper, folgerungen, aus, den, capillarit, tserscheinungen, conclusions, drawn, from, the, phenomena, of, capillarity, in, which, he, proposed, a, model, of, intermolecular, attraction, that, he, afterwards, disavowed, as, worthless, was, published, in, the, journal, annalen, der, physik, in, 1901, his, 24, page, doctoral, dissertation, also, addressed, a, topic, in, molecular, physics, titled, eine, neue, bestimmung, der, molek, ldimensionen, a, new, determination, of, molecular, dimensions, and, dedicated, to, his, friend, marcel, grossman, it, was, completed, on, 30, april, 1905, and, approved, by, professor, alfred, kleiner, of, the, university, of, zurich, three, months, later, einstein, was, formally, awarded, his, phd, on, 15, january, 1906, four, other, pieces, of, work, that, einstein, completed, in, 1905, his, famous, papers, on, the, photoelectric, effect, brownian, motion, his, special, theory, of, relativity, and, the, equivalence, of, mass, and, energy, have, led, to, the, year, being, celebrated, as, an, annus, mirabilis, for, physics, akin, to, 1666, the, year, in, which, isaac, newton, experienced, his, greatest, epiphanies, the, publications, deeply, impressed, einstein, s, contemporaries, einstein, s, sabbatical, as, a, civil, servant, approached, its, end, in, 1908, when, he, secured, a, junior, teaching, position, at, the, university, of, bern, in, 1909, a, lecture, on, relativistic, electrodynamics, that, he, gave, at, the, university, of, zurich, much, admired, by, alfred, kleiner, led, to, z, rich, s, luring, him, away, from, bern, with, a, newly, created, associate, professorship, promotion, to, a, full, professorship, followed, in, april, 1911, when, he, accepted, a, chair, at, the, german, charles, ferdinand, university, in, prague, a, move, which, required, him, to, become, an, austrian, citizen, of, the, austro, hungarian, empire, his, time, in, prague, saw, him, producing, eleven, research, papers, in, july, 1912, he, returned, to, his, alma, mater, the, eth, zurich, to, take, up, a, chair, in, theoretical, physics, his, teaching, activities, there, centred, on, thermodynamics, and, analytical, mechanics, and, his, research, interests, included, the, molecular, theory, of, heat, continuum, mechanics, and, the, development, of, a, relativistic, theory, of, gravitation, in, his, work, on, the, latter, topic, he, was, assisted, by, his, friend, marcel, grossmann, whose, knowledge, of, the, kind, of, mathematics, required, was, greater, than, his, own, in, the, spring, of, 1913, two, german, visitors, max, planck, and, walther, nernst, called, upon, einstein, in, z, rich, in, the, hope, of, persuading, him, to, relocate, to, berlin, they, offered, him, membership, of, the, prussian, academy, of, sciences, the, directorship, of, the, planned, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, and, a, chair, at, the, humboldt, university, of, berlin, that, would, allow, him, to, pursue, his, research, supported, by, a, professorial, salary, but, with, no, teaching, duties, to, burden, him, their, invitation, was, all, the, more, appealing, to, him, because, berlin, happened, to, be, the, home, of, his, latest, girlfriend, elsa, l, wenthal, he, duly, joined, the, academy, on, 24, july, 1913, and, moved, into, an, apartment, in, the, berlin, district, of, dahlem, on, 1, april, 1914, he, was, installed, in, his, humboldt, university, position, shortly, thereafter, the, outbreak, of, the, first, world, war, in, july, 1914, marked, the, beginning, of, einstein, s, gradual, estrangement, from, the, nation, of, his, birth, when, the, manifesto, of, the, ninety, three, was, published, in, october, 1914, a, document, signed, by, a, host, of, prominent, german, thinkers, that, justified, germany, s, belligerence, einstein, was, one, of, the, few, german, intellectuals, to, distance, himself, from, it, and, sign, the, alternative, eirenic, manifesto, to, the, europeans, instead, however, this, expression, of, his, doubts, about, german, policy, did, not, prevent, him, from, being, elected, to, a, two, year, term, as, president, of, the, german, physical, society, in, 1916, when, the, kaiser, wilhelm, institute, for, physics, opened, its, doors, the, following, year, its, foundation, delayed, because, of, the, war, einstein, was, appointed, its, first, director, just, as, planck, and, nernst, had, promised, einstein, was, elected, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, netherlands, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1920, and, a, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, in, 1921, in, 1922, he, was, awarded, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, services, to, theoretical, physics, and, especially, for, his, discovery, of, the, law, of, the, photoelectric, effect, at, this, point, some, physicists, still, regarded, the, general, theory, of, relativity, skeptically, and, the, nobel, citation, displayed, a, degree, of, doubt, even, about, the, work, on, photoelectricity, that, it, acknowledged, it, did, not, assent, to, einstein, s, notion, of, the, particulate, nature, of, light, which, only, won, over, the, entire, scientific, community, when, s, n, bose, derived, the, planck, spectrum, in, 1924, that, same, year, einstein, was, elected, an, international, honorary, member, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, britain, s, closest, equivalent, of, the, nobel, award, the, royal, society, s, copley, medal, was, not, hung, around, einstein, s, neck, until, 1925, he, was, elected, an, international, member, of, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1930, einstein, resigned, from, the, prussian, academy, in, march, 1933, his, accomplishments, in, berlin, had, included, the, completion, of, the, general, theory, of, relativity, proving, the, einstein, de, haas, effect, contributing, to, the, quantum, theory, of, radiation, and, the, development, of, bose, einstein, statistics, in, 1907, einstein, reached, a, milestone, on, his, long, journey, from, his, special, theory, of, relativity, to, a, new, idea, of, gravitation, with, the, formulation, of, his, equivalence, principle, which, asserts, that, an, observer, in, an, infinitesimally, small, box, falling, freely, in, a, gravitational, field, would, be, unable, to, find, any, evidence, that, the, field, exists, in, 1911, he, used, the, principle, to, estimate, the, amount, by, which, a, ray, of, light, from, a, distant, star, would, be, bent, by, the, gravitational, pull, of, the, sun, as, it, passed, close, to, the, sun, s, photosphere, that, is, the, sun, s, apparent, surface, he, reworked, his, calculation, in, 1913, having, now, found, a, way, to, model, gravitation, with, the, riemann, curvature, tensor, of, a, non, euclidean, four, dimensional, spacetime, by, the, fall, of, 1915, his, reimagining, of, the, mathematics, of, gravitation, in, terms, of, riemannian, geometry, was, complete, and, he, applied, his, new, theory, not, just, to, the, behavior, of, the, sun, as, a, gravitational, lens, but, also, to, another, astronomical, phenomenon, the, precession, of, the, perihelion, of, mercury, a, slow, drift, in, the, point, in, mercury, s, elliptical, orbit, at, which, it, approaches, the, sun, most, closely, a, total, eclipse, of, the, sun, that, took, place, on, 29, may, 1919, provided, an, opportunity, to, put, his, theory, of, gravitational, lensing, to, the, test, and, observations, performed, by, sir, arthur, eddington, yielded, results, that, were, consistent, with, his, calculations, eddington, s, work, was, reported, at, length, in, newspapers, around, the, world, on, 7, november, 1919, for, example, the, leading, british, newspaper, the, times, printed, a, banner, headline, that, read, revolution, in, science, new, theory, of, the, universe, newtonian, ideas, overthrown, with, eddington, s, eclipse, observations, widely, reported, not, just, in, academic, journals, but, by, the, popular, press, as, well, einstein, became, perhaps, the, world, s, first, celebrity, scientist, a, genius, who, had, shattered, a, paradigm, that, had, been, basic, to, physicists, understanding, of, the, universe, since, the, seventeenth, century, einstein, began, his, new, life, as, an, intellectual, icon, in, america, where, he, arrived, on, 2, april, 1921, he, was, welcomed, to, new, york, city, by, mayor, john, francis, hylan, and, then, spent, three, weeks, giving, lectures, and, attending, receptions, he, spoke, several, times, at, columbia, university, and, princeton, and, in, washington, he, visited, the, white, house, with, representatives, of, the, national, academy, of, sciences, he, returned, to, europe, via, london, where, he, was, the, guest, of, the, philosopher, and, statesman, viscount, haldane, he, used, his, time, in, the, british, capital, to, meet, several, people, prominent, in, british, scientific, political, or, intellectual, life, and, to, deliver, a, lecture, at, king, s, college, in, july, 1921, he, published, an, essay, my, first, impression, of, the, u, s, a, in, which, he, sought, to, sketch, the, american, character, much, as, had, alexis, de, tocqueville, in, democracy, in, america, 1835, he, wrote, of, his, transatlantic, hosts, in, highly, approving, terms, what, strikes, a, visitor, is, the, joyous, positive, attitude, to, life, the, american, is, friendly, self, confident, optimistic, and, without, envy, in, 1922, einstein, s, travels, were, to, the, old, world, rather, than, the, new, he, devoted, six, months, to, a, tour, of, asia, that, saw, him, speaking, in, japan, singapore, and, sri, lanka, then, known, as, ceylon, after, his, first, public, lecture, in, tokyo, he, met, emperor, yoshihito, and, his, wife, at, the, imperial, palace, with, thousands, of, spectators, thronging, the, streets, in, the, hope, of, catching, a, glimpse, of, him, in, a, letter, to, his, sons, he, wrote, that, japanese, people, seemed, to, him, to, be, generally, modest, intelligent, and, considerate, and, to, have, a, true, appreciation, of, art, but, his, picture, of, them, in, his, diary, was, less, flattering, intellectual, needs, of, this, nation, seem, to, be, weaker, than, their, artistic, ones, natural, disposition, his, journal, also, contains, views, of, china, and, india, which, were, uncomplimentary, of, chinese, people, he, wrote, that, even, the, children, are, spiritless, and, look, obtuse, it, would, be, a, pity, if, these, chinese, supplant, all, other, races, for, the, likes, of, us, the, mere, thought, is, unspeakably, dreary, he, was, greeted, with, even, greater, enthusiasm, on, the, last, leg, of, his, tour, in, which, he, spent, twelve, days, in, mandatory, palestine, newly, entrusted, to, british, rule, by, the, league, of, nations, in, the, aftermath, of, the, first, world, war, sir, herbert, samuel, the, british, high, commissioner, welcomed, him, with, a, degree, of, ceremony, normally, only, accorded, to, a, visiting, head, of, state, including, a, cannon, salute, one, reception, held, in, his, honor, was, stormed, by, people, determined, to, hear, him, speak, he, told, them, that, he, was, happy, that, jews, were, beginning, to, be, recognized, as, a, force, in, the, world, einstein, s, decision, to, tour, the, eastern, hemisphere, in, 1922, meant, that, he, was, unable, to, go, to, stockholm, in, the, december, of, that, year, to, participate, in, the, nobel, prize, ceremony, his, place, at, the, traditional, nobel, banquet, was, taken, by, a, german, diplomat, who, gave, a, speech, praising, him, not, only, as, a, physicist, but, also, as, a, campaigner, for, peace, a, two, week, visit, to, spain, that, he, undertook, in, 1923, saw, him, collecting, another, award, a, membership, of, the, spanish, academy, of, sciences, signified, by, a, diploma, handed, to, him, by, king, alfonso, xiii, his, spanish, trip, also, gave, him, a, chance, to, meet, a, fellow, nobel, laureate, the, neuroanatomist, santiago, ram, n, y, cajal, from, 1922, until, 1932, with, the, exception, of, a, few, months, in, 1923, and, 1924, einstein, was, a, member, of, the, geneva, based, international, committee, on, intellectual, cooperation, of, the, league, of, nations, a, group, set, up, by, the, league, to, encourage, scientists, artists, scholars, teachers, and, other, people, engaged, in, the, life, of, the, mind, to, work, more, closely, with, their, counterparts, in, other, countries, he, was, appointed, as, a, german, delegate, rather, than, as, a, representative, of, switzerland, because, of, the, machinations, of, two, catholic, activists, oskar, halecki, and, giuseppe, motta, by, persuading, secretary, general, eric, drummond, to, deny, einstein, the, place, on, the, committee, reserved, for, a, swiss, thinker, they, created, an, opening, for, gonzague, de, reynold, who, used, his, league, of, nations, position, as, a, platform, from, which, to, promote, traditional, catholic, doctrine, einstein, s, former, physics, professor, hendrik, lorentz, and, the, polish, chemist, marie, curie, were, also, members, of, the, committee, in, march, and, april, 1925, einstein, and, his, wife, visited, south, america, where, they, spent, about, a, week, in, brazil, a, week, in, uruguay, and, a, month, in, argentina, their, tour, was, suggested, by, jorge, duclout, 1856, 1927, and, mauricio, nirenstein, 1877, 1935, with, the, support, of, several, argentine, scholars, including, julio, rey, pastor, jakob, laub, and, leopoldo, lugones, and, was, financed, primarily, by, the, council, of, the, university, of, buenos, aires, and, the, asociaci, n, hebraica, argentina, argentine, hebraic, association, with, a, smaller, contribution, from, the, argentine, germanic, cultural, institution, in, december, 1930, einstein, began, another, significant, sojourn, in, the, united, states, drawn, back, to, the, us, by, the, offer, of, a, two, month, research, fellowship, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, caltech, supported, him, in, his, wish, that, he, should, not, be, exposed, to, quite, as, much, attention, from, the, media, as, he, had, experienced, when, visiting, the, us, in, 1921, and, he, therefore, declined, all, the, invitations, to, receive, prizes, or, make, speeches, that, his, admirers, poured, down, upon, him, but, he, remained, willing, to, allow, his, fans, at, least, some, of, the, time, with, him, that, they, requested, after, arriving, in, new, york, city, einstein, was, taken, to, various, places, and, events, including, chinatown, a, lunch, with, the, editors, of, the, new, york, times, and, a, performance, of, carmen, at, the, metropolitan, opera, where, he, was, cheered, by, the, audience, on, his, arrival, during, the, days, following, he, was, given, the, keys, to, the, city, by, mayor, jimmy, walker, and, met, nicholas, murray, butler, the, president, of, columbia, university, who, described, einstein, as, the, ruling, monarch, of, the, mind, harry, emerson, fosdick, pastor, at, new, york, s, riverside, church, gave, einstein, a, tour, of, the, church, and, showed, him, a, full, size, statue, that, the, church, made, of, einstein, standing, at, the, entrance, also, during, his, stay, in, new, york, he, joined, a, crowd, of, 15, 000, people, at, madison, square, garden, during, a, hanukkah, celebration, einstein, next, traveled, to, california, where, he, met, caltech, president, and, nobel, laureate, robert, a, millikan, his, friendship, with, millikan, was, awkward, as, millikan, had, a, penchant, for, patriotic, militarism, where, einstein, was, a, pronounced, pacifist, during, an, address, to, caltech, s, students, einstein, noted, that, science, was, often, inclined, to, do, more, harm, than, good, this, aversion, to, war, also, led, einstein, to, befriend, author, upton, sinclair, and, film, star, charlie, chaplin, both, noted, for, their, pacifism, carl, laemmle, head, of, universal, studios, gave, einstein, a, tour, of, his, studio, and, introduced, him, to, chaplin, they, had, an, instant, rapport, with, chaplin, inviting, einstein, and, his, wife, elsa, to, his, home, for, dinner, chaplin, said, einstein, s, outward, persona, calm, and, gentle, seemed, to, conceal, a, highly, emotional, temperament, from, which, came, his, extraordinary, intellectual, energy, chaplin, s, film, city, lights, was, to, premiere, a, few, days, later, in, hollywood, and, chaplin, invited, einstein, and, elsa, to, join, him, as, his, special, guests, walter, isaacson, einstein, s, biographer, described, this, as, one, of, the, most, memorable, scenes, in, the, new, era, of, celebrity, chaplin, visited, einstein, at, his, home, on, a, later, trip, to, berlin, and, recalled, his, modest, little, flat, and, the, piano, at, which, he, had, begun, writing, his, theory, chaplin, speculated, that, it, was, possibly, used, as, kindling, wood, by, the, nazis, in, february, 1933, while, on, a, visit, to, the, united, states, einstein, knew, he, could, not, return, to, germany, with, the, rise, to, power, of, the, nazis, under, germany, s, new, chancellor, adolf, hitler, while, at, american, universities, in, early, 1933, he, undertook, his, third, two, month, visiting, professorship, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, in, pasadena, in, february, and, march, 1933, the, gestapo, repeatedly, raided, his, family, s, apartment, in, berlin, he, and, his, wife, elsa, returned, to, europe, in, march, and, during, the, trip, they, learned, that, the, german, reichstag, had, passed, the, enabling, act, on, 23, march, transforming, hitler, s, government, into, a, de, facto, legal, dictatorship, and, that, they, would, not, be, able, to, proceed, to, berlin, later, on, they, heard, that, their, cottage, had, been, raided, by, the, nazis, and, einstein, s, personal, sailboat, confiscated, upon, landing, in, antwerp, belgium, on, 28, march, einstein, immediately, went, to, the, german, consulate, and, surrendered, his, passport, formally, renouncing, his, german, citizenship, the, nazis, later, sold, his, boat, and, converted, his, cottage, into, a, hitler, youth, camp, in, april, 1933, einstein, discovered, that, the, new, german, government, had, passed, laws, barring, jews, from, holding, any, official, positions, including, teaching, at, universities, historian, gerald, holton, describes, how, with, virtually, no, audible, protest, being, raised, by, their, colleagues, thousands, of, jewish, scientists, were, suddenly, forced, to, give, up, their, university, positions, and, their, names, were, removed, from, the, rolls, of, institutions, where, they, were, employed, a, month, later, einstein, s, works, were, among, those, targeted, by, the, german, student, union, in, the, nazi, book, burnings, with, nazi, propaganda, minister, joseph, goebbels, proclaiming, jewish, intellectualism, is, dead, one, german, magazine, included, him, in, a, list, of, enemies, of, the, german, regime, with, the, phrase, not, yet, hanged, offering, a, 5, 000, bounty, on, his, head, in, a, subsequent, letter, to, physicist, and, friend, max, born, who, had, already, emigrated, from, germany, to, england, einstein, wrote, i, must, confess, that, the, degree, of, their, brutality, and, cowardice, came, as, something, of, a, surprise, after, moving, to, the, us, he, described, the, book, burnings, as, a, spontaneous, emotional, outburst, by, those, who, shun, popular, enlightenment, and, more, than, anything, else, in, the, world, fear, the, influence, of, men, of, intellectual, independence, einstein, was, now, without, a, permanent, home, unsure, where, he, would, live, and, work, and, equally, worried, about, the, fate, of, countless, other, scientists, still, in, germany, aided, by, the, academic, assistance, council, founded, in, april, 1933, by, british, liberal, politician, william, beveridge, to, help, academics, escape, nazi, persecution, einstein, was, able, to, leave, germany, he, rented, a, house, in, de, haan, belgium, where, he, lived, for, a, few, months, in, late, july, 1933, he, visited, england, for, about, six, weeks, at, the, invitation, of, the, british, member, of, parliament, commander, oliver, locker, lampson, who, had, become, friends, with, him, in, the, preceding, years, locker, lampson, invited, him, to, stay, near, his, cromer, home, in, a, secluded, wooden, cabin, on, roughton, heath, in, the, parish, of, roughton, norfolk, to, protect, einstein, locker, lampson, had, two, bodyguards, watch, over, him, a, photo, of, them, carrying, shotguns, and, guarding, einstein, was, published, in, the, daily, herald, on, 24, july, 1933, locker, lampson, took, einstein, to, meet, winston, churchill, at, his, home, and, later, austen, chamberlain, and, former, prime, minister, lloyd, george, einstein, asked, them, to, help, bring, jewish, scientists, out, of, germany, british, historian, martin, gilbert, notes, that, churchill, responded, immediately, and, sent, his, friend, physicist, frederick, lindemann, to, germany, to, seek, out, jewish, scientists, and, place, them, in, british, universities, churchill, later, observed, that, as, a, result, of, germany, having, driven, the, jews, out, they, had, lowered, their, technical, standards, and, put, the, allies, technology, ahead, of, theirs, einstein, later, contacted, leaders, of, other, nations, including, turkey, s, prime, minister, smet, n, n, to, whom, he, wrote, in, september, 1933, requesting, placement, of, unemployed, german, jewish, scientists, as, a, result, of, einstein, s, letter, jewish, invitees, to, turkey, eventually, totaled, over, 1, 000, saved, individuals, locker, lampson, also, submitted, a, bill, to, parliament, to, extend, british, citizenship, to, einstein, during, which, period, einstein, made, a, number, of, public, appearances, describing, the, crisis, brewing, in, europe, in, one, of, his, speeches, he, denounced, germany, s, treatment, of, jews, while, at, the, same, time, he, introduced, a, bill, promoting, jewish, citizenship, in, palestine, as, they, were, being, denied, citizenship, elsewhere, in, his, speech, he, described, einstein, as, a, citizen, of, the, world, who, should, be, offered, a, temporary, shelter, in, the, uk, both, bills, failed, however, and, einstein, then, accepted, an, earlier, offer, from, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, us, to, become, a, resident, scholar, on, 3, october, 1933, einstein, delivered, a, speech, on, the, importance, of, academic, freedom, before, a, packed, audience, at, the, royal, albert, hall, in, london, with, the, times, reporting, he, was, wildly, cheered, throughout, four, days, later, he, returned, to, the, us, and, took, up, a, position, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, noted, for, having, become, a, refuge, for, scientists, fleeing, nazi, germany, at, the, time, most, american, universities, including, harvard, princeton, and, yale, had, minimal, or, no, jewish, faculty, or, students, as, a, result, of, their, jewish, quotas, which, lasted, until, the, late, 1940s, einstein, was, still, undecided, about, his, future, he, had, offers, from, several, european, universities, including, christ, church, oxford, where, he, stayed, for, three, short, periods, between, may, 1931, and, june, 1933, and, was, offered, a, five, year, research, fellowship, called, a, studentship, at, christ, church, but, in, 1935, he, arrived, at, the, decision, to, remain, permanently, in, the, united, states, and, apply, for, citizenship, einstein, s, affiliation, with, the, institute, for, advanced, study, would, last, until, his, death, in, 1955, he, was, one, of, the, four, first, selected, along, with, john, von, neumann, kurt, g, del, and, hermann, weyl, at, the, new, institute, he, soon, developed, a, close, friendship, with, g, del, the, two, would, take, long, walks, together, discussing, their, work, bruria, kaufman, his, assistant, later, became, a, physicist, during, this, period, einstein, tried, to, develop, a, unified, field, theory, and, to, refute, the, accepted, interpretation, of, quantum, physics, both, unsuccessfully, he, lived, in, princeton, at, his, home, from, 1935, onwards, the, albert, einstein, house, was, made, a, national, historic, landmark, in, 1976, in, 1939, a, group, of, hungarian, scientists, that, included, migr, physicist, le, szil, rd, attempted, to, alert, washington, to, ongoing, nazi, atomic, bomb, research, the, group, s, warnings, were, discounted, einstein, and, szil, rd, along, with, other, refugees, such, as, edward, teller, and, eugene, wigner, regarded, it, as, their, responsibility, to, alert, americans, to, the, possibility, that, german, scientists, might, win, the, race, to, build, an, atomic, bomb, and, to, warn, that, hitler, would, be, more, than, willing, to, resort, to, such, a, weapon, to, make, certain, the, us, was, aware, of, the, danger, in, july, 1939, a, few, months, before, the, beginning, of, world, war, ii, in, europe, szil, rd, and, wigner, visited, einstein, to, explain, the, possibility, of, atomic, bombs, which, einstein, a, pacifist, said, he, had, never, considered, he, was, asked, to, lend, his, support, by, writing, a, letter, with, szil, rd, to, president, roosevelt, recommending, the, us, pay, attention, and, engage, in, its, own, nuclear, weapons, research, the, letter, is, believed, to, be, arguably, the, key, stimulus, for, the, u, s, adoption, of, serious, investigations, into, nuclear, weapons, on, the, eve, of, the, u, s, entry, into, world, war, ii, in, addition, to, the, letter, einstein, used, his, connections, with, the, belgian, royal, family, and, the, belgian, queen, mother, to, get, access, with, a, personal, envoy, to, the, white, house, s, oval, office, some, say, that, as, a, result, of, einstein, s, letter, and, his, meetings, with, roosevelt, the, us, entered, the, race, to, develop, the, bomb, drawing, on, its, immense, material, financial, and, scientific, resources, to, initiate, the, manhattan, project, for, einstein, war, was, a, disease, he, called, for, resistance, to, war, by, signing, the, letter, to, roosevelt, some, argue, he, went, against, his, pacifist, principles, in, 1954, a, year, before, his, death, einstein, said, to, his, old, friend, linus, pauling, i, made, one, great, mistake, in, my, life, when, i, signed, the, letter, to, president, roosevelt, recommending, that, atom, bombs, be, made, but, there, was, some, justification, the, danger, that, the, germans, would, make, them, in, 1955, einstein, and, ten, other, intellectuals, and, scientists, including, british, philosopher, bertrand, russell, signed, a, manifesto, highlighting, the, danger, of, nuclear, weapons, in, 1960, einstein, was, included, posthumously, as, a, charter, member, of, the, world, academy, of, art, and, science, waas, an, organization, founded, by, distinguished, scientists, and, intellectuals, who, committed, themselves, to, the, responsible, and, ethical, advances, of, science, particularly, in, light, of, the, development, of, nuclear, weapons, einstein, became, an, american, citizen, in, 1940, not, long, after, settling, into, his, career, at, the, institute, for, advanced, study, in, princeton, new, jersey, he, expressed, his, appreciation, of, the, meritocracy, in, american, culture, compared, to, europe, he, recognized, the, right, of, individuals, to, say, and, think, what, they, pleased, without, social, barriers, as, a, result, individuals, were, encouraged, he, said, to, be, more, creative, a, trait, he, valued, from, his, early, education, einstein, joined, the, national, association, for, the, advancement, of, colored, people, naacp, in, princeton, where, he, campaigned, for, the, civil, rights, of, african, americans, he, considered, racism, america, s, worst, disease, seeing, it, as, handed, down, from, one, generation, to, the, next, as, part, of, his, involvement, he, corresponded, with, civil, rights, activist, w, e, b, du, bois, and, was, prepared, to, testify, on, his, behalf, during, his, trial, as, an, alleged, foreign, agent, in, 1951, when, einstein, offered, to, be, a, character, witness, for, du, bois, the, judge, decided, to, drop, the, case, in, 1946, einstein, visited, lincoln, university, in, pennsylvania, a, historically, black, college, where, he, was, awarded, an, honorary, degree, lincoln, was, the, first, university, in, the, united, states, to, grant, college, degrees, to, african, americans, alumni, include, langston, hughes, and, thurgood, marshall, einstein, gave, a, speech, about, racism, in, america, adding, i, do, not, intend, to, be, quiet, about, it, a, resident, of, princeton, recalls, that, einstein, had, once, paid, the, college, tuition, for, a, black, student, einstein, has, said, being, a, jew, myself, perhaps, i, can, understand, and, empathize, with, how, black, people, feel, as, victims, of, discrimination, in, 1918, einstein, was, one, of, the, signatories, of, the, founding, proclamation, of, the, german, democratic, party, a, liberal, party, later, in, his, life, einstein, s, political, view, was, in, favor, of, socialism, and, critical, of, capitalism, which, he, detailed, in, his, essays, such, as, why, socialism, his, opinions, on, the, bolsheviks, also, changed, with, time, in, 1925, he, criticized, them, for, not, having, a, well, regulated, system, of, government, and, called, their, rule, a, regime, of, terror, and, a, tragedy, in, human, history, he, later, adopted, a, more, moderated, view, criticizing, their, methods, but, praising, them, which, is, shown, by, his, 1929, remark, on, vladimir, lenin, in, lenin, i, honor, a, man, who, in, total, sacrifice, of, his, own, person, has, committed, his, entire, energy, to, realizing, social, justice, i, do, not, find, his, methods, advisable, one, thing, is, certain, however, men, like, him, are, the, guardians, and, renewers, of, mankind, s, conscience, einstein, offered, and, was, called, on, to, give, judgments, and, opinions, on, matters, often, unrelated, to, theoretical, physics, or, mathematics, he, strongly, advocated, the, idea, of, a, democratic, global, government, that, would, check, the, power, of, nation, states, in, the, framework, of, a, world, federation, he, wrote, i, advocate, world, government, because, i, am, convinced, that, there, is, no, other, possible, way, of, eliminating, the, most, terrible, danger, in, which, man, has, ever, found, himself, the, fbi, created, a, secret, dossier, on, einstein, in, 1932, by, the, time, of, his, death, it, was, 1, 427, pages, long, einstein, was, deeply, impressed, by, mahatma, gandhi, with, whom, he, corresponded, he, described, gandhi, as, a, role, model, for, the, generations, to, come, the, initial, connection, was, established, on, 27, september, 1931, when, wilfrid, israel, took, his, indian, guest, v, a, sundaram, to, meet, his, friend, einstein, at, his, summer, home, in, the, town, of, caputh, sundaram, was, gandhi, s, disciple, and, special, envoy, whom, wilfrid, israel, met, while, visiting, india, and, visiting, the, indian, leader, s, home, in, 1925, during, the, visit, einstein, wrote, a, short, letter, to, gandhi, that, was, delivered, to, him, through, his, envoy, and, gandhi, responded, quickly, with, his, own, letter, although, in, the, end, einstein, and, gandhi, were, unable, to, meet, as, they, had, hoped, the, direct, connection, between, them, was, established, through, wilfrid, israel, einstein, was, a, figurehead, leader, in, the, establishment, of, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, which, opened, in, 1925, earlier, in, 1921, he, was, asked, by, the, biochemist, and, president, of, the, world, zionist, organization, chaim, weizmann, to, help, raise, funds, for, the, planned, university, he, made, suggestions, for, the, creation, of, an, institute, of, agriculture, a, chemical, institute, and, an, institute, of, microbiology, in, order, to, fight, the, various, ongoing, epidemics, such, as, malaria, which, he, called, an, evil, that, was, undermining, a, third, of, the, country, s, development, he, also, promoted, the, establishment, of, an, oriental, studies, institute, to, include, language, courses, given, in, both, hebrew, and, arabic, einstein, was, not, a, nationalist, and, opposed, the, creation, of, an, independent, jewish, state, he, felt, that, the, waves, of, arriving, jews, of, the, aliyah, could, live, alongside, existing, arabs, in, palestine, the, state, of, israel, was, established, without, his, help, in, 1948, einstein, was, limited, to, a, marginal, role, in, the, zionist, movement, upon, the, death, of, israeli, president, weizmann, in, november, 1952, prime, minister, david, ben, gurion, offered, einstein, the, largely, ceremonial, position, of, president, of, israel, at, the, urging, of, ezriel, carlebach, the, offer, was, presented, by, israel, s, ambassador, in, washington, abba, eban, who, explained, that, the, offer, embodies, the, deepest, respect, which, the, jewish, people, can, repose, in, any, of, its, sons, einstein, wrote, that, he, was, deeply, moved, but, at, once, saddened, and, ashamed, that, he, could, not, accept, it, per, lee, smolin, i, believe, wat, allowed, einstein, to, achieve, so, much, was, primarily, a, moral, quality, he, simply, cared, far, more, than, most, of, his, colleagues, that, the, laws, of, physics, have, to, explain, everything, in, nature, coherently, and, consistently, einstein, expounded, his, spiritual, outlook, in, a, wide, array, of, writings, and, interviews, he, said, he, had, sympathy, for, the, impersonal, pantheistic, god, of, baruch, spinoza, s, philosophy, he, did, not, believe, in, a, personal, god, who, concerns, himself, with, fates, and, actions, of, human, beings, a, view, which, he, described, as, na, ve, he, clarified, however, that, i, am, not, an, atheist, preferring, to, call, himself, an, agnostic, or, a, deeply, religious, nonbeliever, he, wrote, that, a, spirit, is, manifest, in, the, laws, of, the, universe, a, spirit, vastly, superior, to, that, of, man, and, one, in, the, face, of, which, we, with, our, modest, powers, must, feel, humble, in, this, way, the, pursuit, of, science, leads, to, a, religious, feeling, of, a, special, sort, einstein, was, primarily, affiliated, with, non, religious, humanist, and, ethical, culture, groups, in, both, the, uk, and, us, he, served, on, the, advisory, board, of, the, first, humanist, society, of, new, york, and, was, an, honorary, associate, of, the, rationalist, association, which, publishes, new, humanist, in, britain, for, the, 75th, anniversary, of, the, new, york, society, for, ethical, culture, he, stated, that, the, idea, of, ethical, culture, embodied, his, personal, conception, of, what, is, most, valuable, and, enduring, in, religious, idealism, he, observed, without, ethical, culture, there, is, no, salvation, for, humanity, in, a, german, language, letter, to, philosopher, eric, gutkind, dated, 3, january, 1954, einstein, wrote, the, word, god, is, for, me, nothing, more, than, the, expression, and, product, of, human, weaknesses, the, bible, a, collection, of, honorable, but, still, primitive, legends, which, are, nevertheless, pretty, childish, no, interpretation, no, matter, how, subtle, can, for, me, change, this, for, me, the, jewish, religion, like, all, other, religions, is, an, incarnation, of, the, most, childish, superstitions, and, the, jewish, people, to, whom, i, gladly, belong, and, with, whose, mentality, i, have, a, deep, affinity, have, no, different, quality, for, me, than, all, other, people, i, cannot, see, anything, chosen, about, them, einstein, had, been, sympathetic, toward, vegetarianism, for, a, long, time, in, a, letter, in, 1930, to, hermann, huth, vice, president, of, the, german, vegetarian, federation, deutsche, vegetarier, bund, he, wrote, although, i, have, been, prevented, by, outward, circumstances, from, observing, a, strictly, vegetarian, diet, i, have, long, been, an, adherent, to, the, cause, in, principle, besides, agreeing, with, the, aims, of, vegetarianism, for, aesthetic, and, moral, reasons, it, is, my, view, that, a, vegetarian, manner, of, living, by, its, purely, physical, effect, on, the, human, temperament, would, most, beneficially, influence, the, lot, of, mankind, he, became, a, vegetarian, himself, only, during, the, last, part, of, his, life, in, march, 1954, he, wrote, in, a, letter, so, i, am, living, without, fats, without, meat, without, fish, but, am, feeling, quite, well, this, way, it, almost, seems, to, me, that, man, was, not, born, to, be, a, carnivore, einstein, developed, an, appreciation, for, music, at, an, early, age, in, his, late, journals, he, wrote, if, i, were, not, a, physicist, i, would, probably, be, a, musician, i, often, think, in, music, i, live, my, daydreams, in, music, i, see, my, life, in, terms, of, music, i, get, most, joy, in, life, out, of, music, his, mother, played, the, piano, reasonably, well, and, wanted, her, son, to, learn, the, violin, not, only, to, instill, in, him, a, love, of, music, but, also, to, help, him, assimilate, into, german, culture, according, to, conductor, leon, botstein, einstein, began, playing, when, he, was, 5, however, he, did, not, enjoy, it, at, that, age, when, he, turned, 13, he, discovered, the, violin, sonatas, of, mozart, whereupon, he, became, enamored, of, mozart, s, compositions, and, studied, music, more, willingly, einstein, taught, himself, to, play, without, ever, practicing, systematically, he, said, that, love, is, a, better, teacher, than, a, sense, of, duty, at, the, age, of, 17, he, was, heard, by, a, school, examiner, in, aarau, while, playing, beethoven, s, violin, sonatas, the, examiner, stated, afterward, that, his, playing, was, remarkable, and, revealing, of, great, insight, what, struck, the, examiner, writes, botstein, was, that, einstein, displayed, a, deep, love, of, the, music, a, quality, that, was, and, remains, in, short, supply, music, possessed, an, unusual, meaning, for, this, student, music, took, on, a, pivotal, and, permanent, role, in, einstein, s, life, from, that, period, on, although, the, idea, of, becoming, a, professional, musician, himself, was, not, on, his, mind, at, any, time, among, those, with, whom, einstein, played, chamber, music, were, a, few, professionals, including, kurt, appelbaum, and, he, performed, for, private, audiences, and, friends, chamber, music, had, also, become, a, regular, part, of, his, social, life, while, living, in, bern, z, rich, and, berlin, where, he, played, with, max, planck, and, his, son, among, others, he, is, sometimes, erroneously, credited, as, the, editor, of, the, 1937, edition, of, the, k, chel, catalog, of, mozart, s, work, that, edition, was, prepared, by, alfred, einstein, who, may, have, been, a, distant, relation, in, 1931, while, engaged, in, research, at, the, california, institute, of, technology, he, visited, the, zoellner, family, conservatory, in, los, angeles, where, he, played, some, of, beethoven, and, mozart, s, works, with, members, of, the, zoellner, quartet, near, the, end, of, his, life, when, the, young, juilliard, quartet, visited, him, in, princeton, he, played, his, violin, with, them, and, the, quartet, was, impressed, by, einstein, s, level, of, coordination, and, intonation, on, 17, april, 1955, einstein, experienced, internal, bleeding, caused, by, the, rupture, of, an, abdominal, aortic, aneurysm, which, had, previously, been, reinforced, surgically, by, rudolph, nissen, in, 1948, he, took, the, draft, of, a, speech, he, was, preparing, for, a, television, appearance, commemorating, the, state, of, israel, s, seventh, anniversary, with, him, to, the, hospital, but, he, did, not, live, to, complete, it, einstein, refused, surgery, saying, i, want, to, go, when, i, want, it, is, tasteless, to, prolong, life, artificially, i, have, done, my, share, it, is, time, to, go, i, will, do, it, elegantly, he, died, in, the, princeton, hospital, early, the, next, morning, at, the, age, of, 76, having, continued, to, work, until, near, the, end, during, the, autopsy, the, pathologist, thomas, stoltz, harvey, removed, einstein, s, brain, for, preservation, without, the, permission, of, his, family, in, the, hope, that, the, neuroscience, of, the, future, would, be, able, to, discover, what, made, einstein, so, intelligent, einstein, s, remains, were, cremated, in, trenton, new, jersey, and, his, ashes, were, scattered, at, an, undisclosed, location, in, a, memorial, lecture, delivered, on, 13, december, 1965, at, unesco, headquarters, nuclear, physicist, j, robert, oppenheimer, summarized, his, impression, of, einstein, as, a, person, he, was, almost, wholly, without, sophistication, and, wholly, without, worldliness, there, was, always, with, him, a, wonderful, purity, at, once, childlike, and, profoundly, stubborn, einstein, bequeathed, his, personal, archives, library, and, intellectual, assets, to, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, in, israel, throughout, his, life, einstein, published, hundreds, of, books, and, articles, he, published, more, than, 300, scientific, papers, and, 150, non, scientific, ones, on, 5, december, 2014, universities, and, archives, announced, the, release, of, einstein, s, papers, comprising, more, than, 30, 000, unique, documents, in, addition, to, the, work, he, did, by, himself, he, also, collaborated, with, other, scientists, on, additional, projects, including, the, bose, einstein, statistics, the, einstein, refrigerator, and, others, einstein, s, first, paper, submitted, in, 1900, to, annalen, der, physik, was, on, capillary, attraction, it, was, published, in, 1901, with, the, title, folgerungen, aus, den, capillarit, tserscheinungen, which, translates, as, conclusions, from, the, capillarity, phenomena, two, papers, he, published, in, 1902, 1903, thermodynamics, attempted, to, interpret, atomic, phenomena, from, a, statistical, point, of, view, these, papers, were, the, foundation, for, the, 1905, paper, on, brownian, motion, which, showed, that, brownian, movement, can, be, construed, as, firm, evidence, that, molecules, exist, his, research, in, 1903, and, 1904, was, mainly, concerned, with, the, effect, of, finite, atomic, size, on, diffusion, phenomena, einstein, returned, to, the, problem, of, thermodynamic, fluctuations, giving, a, treatment, of, the, density, variations, in, a, fluid, at, its, critical, point, ordinarily, the, density, fluctuations, are, controlled, by, the, second, derivative, of, the, free, energy, with, respect, to, the, density, at, the, critical, point, this, derivative, is, zero, leading, to, large, fluctuations, the, effect, of, density, fluctuations, is, that, light, of, all, wavelengths, is, scattered, making, the, fluid, look, milky, white, einstein, relates, this, to, rayleigh, scattering, which, is, what, happens, when, the, fluctuation, size, is, much, smaller, than, the, wavelength, and, which, explains, why, the, sky, is, blue, einstein, quantitatively, derived, critical, opalescence, from, a, treatment, of, density, fluctuations, and, demonstrated, how, both, the, effect, and, rayleigh, scattering, originate, from, the, atomistic, constitution, of, matter, the, annus, mirabilis, papers, are, four, articles, pertaining, to, the, photoelectric, effect, which, gave, rise, to, quantum, theory, brownian, motion, the, special, theory, of, relativity, and, e, mc, 2, that, einstein, published, in, the, annalen, der, physik, scientific, journal, in, 1905, these, four, works, contributed, substantially, to, the, foundation, of, modern, physics, and, changed, views, on, space, time, and, matter, the, four, papers, are, einstein, s, zur, elektrodynamik, bewegter, k, rper, on, the, electrodynamics, of, moving, bodies, was, received, on, 30, june, 1905, and, published, 26, september, of, that, same, year, it, reconciled, conflicts, between, maxwell, s, equations, the, laws, of, electricity, and, magnetism, and, the, laws, of, newtonian, mechanics, by, introducing, changes, to, the, laws, of, mechanics, observationally, the, effects, of, these, changes, are, most, apparent, at, high, speeds, where, objects, are, moving, at, speeds, close, to, the, speed, of, light, the, theory, developed, in, this, paper, later, became, known, as, einstein, s, special, theory, of, relativity, this, paper, predicted, that, when, measured, in, the, frame, of, a, relatively, moving, observer, a, clock, carried, by, a, moving, body, would, appear, to, slow, down, and, the, body, itself, would, contract, in, its, direction, of, motion, this, paper, also, argued, that, the, idea, of, a, luminiferous, aether, one, of, the, leading, theoretical, entities, in, physics, at, the, time, was, superfluous, in, his, paper, on, mass, energy, equivalence, einstein, produced, e, mc, 2, as, a, consequence, of, his, special, relativity, equations, einstein, s, 1905, work, on, relativity, remained, controversial, for, many, years, but, was, accepted, by, leading, physicists, starting, with, max, planck, einstein, originally, framed, special, relativity, in, terms, of, kinematics, the, study, of, moving, bodies, in, 1908, hermann, minkowski, reinterpreted, special, relativity, in, geometric, terms, as, a, theory, of, spacetime, einstein, adopted, minkowski, s, formalism, in, his, 1915, general, theory, of, relativity, general, relativity, gr, is, a, theory, of, gravitation, that, was, developed, by, einstein, between, 1907, and, 1915, according, to, it, the, observed, gravitational, attraction, between, masses, results, from, the, warping, of, spacetime, by, those, masses, general, relativity, has, developed, into, an, essential, tool, in, modern, astrophysics, it, provides, the, foundation, for, the, current, understanding, of, black, holes, regions, of, space, where, gravitational, attraction, is, so, strong, that, not, even, light, can, escape, as, einstein, later, said, the, reason, for, the, development, of, general, relativity, was, that, the, preference, of, inertial, motions, within, special, relativity, was, unsatisfactory, while, a, theory, which, from, the, outset, prefers, no, state, of, motion, even, accelerated, ones, should, appear, more, satisfactory, consequently, in, 1907, he, published, an, article, on, acceleration, under, special, relativity, in, that, article, titled, on, the, relativity, principle, and, the, conclusions, drawn, from, it, he, argued, that, free, fall, is, really, inertial, motion, and, that, for, a, free, falling, observer, the, rules, of, special, relativity, must, apply, this, argument, is, called, the, equivalence, principle, in, the, same, article, einstein, also, predicted, the, phenomena, of, gravitational, time, dilation, gravitational, redshift, and, gravitational, lensing, in, 1911, einstein, published, another, article, on, the, influence, of, gravitation, on, the, propagation, of, light, expanding, on, the, 1907, article, in, which, he, estimated, the, amount, of, deflection, of, light, by, massive, bodies, thus, the, theoretical, prediction, of, general, relativity, could, for, the, first, time, be, tested, experimentally, in, 1916, einstein, predicted, gravitational, waves, ripples, in, the, curvature, of, spacetime, which, propagate, as, waves, traveling, outward, from, the, source, transporting, energy, as, gravitational, radiation, the, existence, of, gravitational, waves, is, possible, under, general, relativity, due, to, its, lorentz, invariance, which, brings, the, concept, of, a, finite, speed, of, propagation, of, the, physical, interactions, of, gravity, with, it, by, contrast, gravitational, waves, cannot, exist, in, the, newtonian, theory, of, gravitation, which, postulates, that, the, physical, interactions, of, gravity, propagate, at, infinite, speed, the, first, indirect, detection, of, gravitational, waves, came, in, the, 1970s, through, observation, of, a, pair, of, closely, orbiting, neutron, stars, psr, b1913, 16, the, explanation, for, the, decay, in, their, orbital, period, was, that, they, were, emitting, gravitational, waves, einstein, s, prediction, was, confirmed, on, 11, february, 2016, when, researchers, at, ligo, published, the, first, observation, of, gravitational, waves, detected, on, earth, on, 14, september, 2015, nearly, one, hundred, years, after, the, prediction, while, developing, general, relativity, einstein, became, confused, about, the, gauge, invariance, in, the, theory, he, formulated, an, argument, that, led, him, to, conclude, that, a, general, relativistic, field, theory, is, impossible, he, gave, up, looking, for, fully, generally, covariant, tensor, equations, and, searched, for, equations, that, would, be, invariant, under, general, linear, transformations, only, in, june, 1913, the, entwurf, draft, theory, was, the, result, of, these, investigations, as, its, name, suggests, it, was, a, sketch, of, a, theory, less, elegant, and, more, difficult, than, general, relativity, with, the, equations, of, motion, supplemented, by, additional, gauge, fixing, conditions, after, more, than, two, years, of, intensive, work, einstein, realized, that, the, hole, argument, was, mistaken, and, abandoned, the, theory, in, november, 1915, in, 1917, einstein, applied, the, general, theory, of, relativity, to, the, structure, of, the, universe, as, a, whole, he, discovered, that, the, general, field, equations, predicted, a, universe, that, was, dynamic, either, contracting, or, expanding, as, observational, evidence, for, a, dynamic, universe, was, lacking, at, the, time, einstein, introduced, a, new, term, the, cosmological, constant, into, the, field, equations, in, order, to, allow, the, theory, to, predict, a, static, universe, the, modified, field, equations, predicted, a, static, universe, of, closed, curvature, in, accordance, with, einstein, s, understanding, of, mach, s, principle, in, these, years, this, model, became, known, as, the, einstein, world, or, einstein, s, static, universe, following, the, discovery, of, the, recession, of, the, galaxies, by, edwin, hubble, in, 1929, einstein, abandoned, his, static, model, of, the, universe, and, proposed, two, dynamic, models, of, the, cosmos, the, friedmann, einstein, universe, of, 1931, and, the, einstein, de, sitter, universe, of, 1932, in, each, of, these, models, einstein, discarded, the, cosmological, constant, claiming, that, it, was, in, any, case, theoretically, unsatisfactory, in, many, einstein, biographies, it, is, claimed, that, einstein, referred, to, the, cosmological, constant, in, later, years, as, his, biggest, blunder, based, on, a, letter, george, gamow, claimed, to, have, received, from, him, the, astrophysicist, mario, livio, has, cast, doubt, on, this, claim, in, late, 2013, a, team, led, by, the, irish, physicist, cormac, o, raifeartaigh, discovered, evidence, that, shortly, after, learning, of, hubble, s, observations, of, the, recession, of, the, galaxies, einstein, considered, a, steady, state, model, of, the, universe, in, a, hitherto, overlooked, manuscript, apparently, written, in, early, 1931, einstein, explored, a, model, of, the, expanding, universe, in, which, the, density, of, matter, remains, constant, due, to, a, continuous, creation, of, matter, a, process, that, he, associated, with, the, cosmological, constant, as, he, stated, in, the, paper, in, what, follows, i, would, like, to, draw, attention, to, a, solution, to, equation, 1, that, can, account, for, hubbel, s, facts, and, in, which, the, density, is, constant, over, time, if, one, considers, a, physically, bounded, volume, particles, of, matter, will, be, continually, leaving, it, for, the, density, to, remain, constant, new, particles, of, matter, must, be, continually, formed, in, the, volume, from, space, it, thus, appears, that, einstein, considered, a, steady, state, model, of, the, expanding, universe, many, years, before, hoyle, bondi, and, gold, however, einstein, s, steady, state, model, contained, a, fundamental, flaw, and, he, quickly, abandoned, the, idea, general, relativity, includes, a, dynamical, spacetime, so, it, is, difficult, to, see, how, to, identify, the, conserved, energy, and, momentum, noether, s, theorem, allows, these, quantities, to, be, determined, from, a, lagrangian, with, translation, invariance, but, general, covariance, makes, translation, invariance, into, something, of, a, gauge, symmetry, the, energy, and, momentum, derived, within, general, relativity, by, noether, s, prescriptions, do, not, make, a, real, tensor, for, this, reason, einstein, argued, that, this, is, true, for, a, fundamental, reason, the, gravitational, field, could, be, made, to, vanish, by, a, choice, of, coordinates, he, maintained, that, the, non, covariant, energy, momentum, pseudotensor, was, in, fact, the, best, description, of, the, energy, momentum, distribution, in, a, gravitational, field, while, the, use, of, non, covariant, objects, like, pseudotensors, was, criticized, by, erwin, schr, dinger, and, others, einstein, s, approach, has, been, echoed, by, physicists, including, lev, landau, and, evgeny, lifshitz, in, 1935, einstein, collaborated, with, nathan, rosen, to, produce, a, model, of, a, wormhole, often, called, einstein, rosen, bridges, his, motivation, was, to, model, elementary, particles, with, charge, as, a, solution, of, gravitational, field, equations, in, line, with, the, program, outlined, in, the, paper, do, gravitational, fields, play, an, important, role, in, the, constitution, of, the, elementary, particles, these, solutions, cut, and, pasted, schwarzschild, black, holes, to, make, a, bridge, between, two, patches, because, these, solutions, included, spacetime, curvature, without, the, presence, of, a, physical, body, einstein, and, rosen, suggested, that, they, could, provide, the, beginnings, of, a, theory, that, avoided, the, notion, of, point, particles, however, it, was, later, found, that, einstein, rosen, bridges, are, not, stable, in, order, to, incorporate, spinning, point, particles, into, general, relativity, the, affine, connection, needed, to, be, generalized, to, include, an, antisymmetric, part, called, the, torsion, this, modification, was, made, by, einstein, and, cartan, in, the, 1920s, in, general, relativity, gravitational, force, is, reimagined, as, curvature, of, spacetime, a, curved, path, like, an, orbit, is, not, the, result, of, a, force, deflecting, a, body, from, an, ideal, straight, line, path, but, rather, the, body, s, attempt, to, fall, freely, through, a, background, that, is, itself, curved, by, the, presence, of, other, masses, a, remark, by, john, archibald, wheeler, that, has, become, proverbial, among, physicists, summarizes, the, theory, spacetime, tells, matter, how, to, move, matter, tells, spacetime, how, to, curve, the, einstein, field, equations, cover, the, latter, aspect, of, the, theory, relating, the, curvature, of, spacetime, to, the, distribution, of, matter, and, energy, the, geodesic, equation, covers, the, former, aspect, stating, that, freely, falling, bodies, follow, lines, that, are, as, straight, as, possible, in, a, curved, spacetime, einstein, regarded, this, as, an, independent, fundamental, assumption, that, had, to, be, postulated, in, addition, to, the, field, equations, in, order, to, complete, the, theory, believing, this, to, be, a, shortcoming, in, how, general, relativity, was, originally, presented, he, wished, to, derive, it, from, the, field, equations, themselves, since, the, equations, of, general, relativity, are, non, linear, a, lump, of, energy, made, out, of, pure, gravitational, fields, like, a, black, hole, would, move, on, a, trajectory, which, is, determined, by, the, einstein, field, equations, themselves, not, by, a, new, law, accordingly, einstein, proposed, that, the, field, equations, would, determine, the, path, of, a, singular, solution, like, a, black, hole, to, be, a, geodesic, both, physicists, and, philosophers, have, often, repeated, the, assertion, that, the, geodesic, equation, can, be, obtained, from, applying, the, field, equations, to, the, motion, of, a, gravitational, singularity, but, this, claim, remains, disputed, in, a, 1905, paper, einstein, postulated, that, light, itself, consists, of, localized, particles, quanta, einstein, s, light, quanta, were, nearly, universally, rejected, by, all, physicists, including, max, planck, and, niels, bohr, this, idea, only, became, universally, accepted, in, 1919, with, robert, millikan, s, detailed, experiments, on, the, photoelectric, effect, and, with, the, measurement, of, compton, scattering, einstein, concluded, that, each, wave, of, frequency, f, is, associated, with, a, collection, of, photons, with, energy, hf, each, where, h, is, the, planck, constant, he, did, not, say, much, more, because, he, was, not, sure, how, the, particles, were, related, to, the, wave, but, he, did, suggest, that, this, idea, would, explain, certain, experimental, results, notably, the, photoelectric, effect, light, quanta, were, dubbed, photons, by, gilbert, n, lewis, in, 1926, in, 1907, einstein, proposed, a, model, of, matter, where, each, atom, in, a, lattice, structure, is, an, independent, harmonic, oscillator, in, the, einstein, model, each, atom, oscillates, independently, a, series, of, equally, spaced, quantized, states, for, each, oscillator, einstein, was, aware, that, getting, the, frequency, of, the, actual, oscillations, would, be, difficult, but, he, nevertheless, proposed, this, theory, because, it, was, a, particularly, clear, demonstration, that, quantum, mechanics, could, solve, the, specific, heat, problem, in, classical, mechanics, peter, debye, refined, this, model, in, 1924, einstein, received, a, description, of, a, statistical, model, from, indian, physicist, satyendra, nath, bose, based, on, a, counting, method, that, assumed, that, light, could, be, understood, as, a, gas, of, indistinguishable, particles, einstein, noted, that, bose, s, statistics, applied, to, some, atoms, as, well, as, to, the, proposed, light, particles, and, submitted, his, translation, of, bose, s, paper, to, the, zeitschrift, f, r, physik, einstein, also, published, his, own, articles, describing, the, model, and, its, implications, among, them, the, bose, einstein, condensate, phenomenon, that, some, particulates, should, appear, at, very, low, temperatures, it, was, not, until, 1995, that, the, first, such, condensate, was, produced, experimentally, by, eric, allin, cornell, and, carl, wieman, using, ultra, cooling, equipment, built, at, the, nist, jila, laboratory, at, the, university, of, colorado, at, boulder, bose, einstein, statistics, are, now, used, to, describe, the, behaviors, of, any, assembly, of, bosons, einstein, s, sketches, for, this, project, may, be, seen, in, the, einstein, archive, in, the, library, of, the, leiden, university, although, the, patent, office, promoted, einstein, to, technical, examiner, second, class, in, 1906, he, had, not, given, up, on, academia, in, 1908, he, became, a, privatdozent, at, the, university, of, bern, in, ber, die, entwicklung, unserer, anschauungen, ber, das, wesen, und, die, konstitution, der, strahlung, the, development, of, our, views, on, the, composition, and, essence, of, radiation, on, the, quantization, of, light, and, in, an, earlier, 1909, paper, einstein, showed, that, max, planck, s, energy, quanta, must, have, well, defined, momenta, and, act, in, some, respects, as, independent, point, like, particles, this, paper, introduced, the, photon, concept, and, inspired, the, notion, of, wave, particle, duality, in, quantum, mechanics, einstein, saw, this, wave, particle, duality, in, radiation, as, concrete, evidence, for, his, conviction, that, physics, needed, a, new, unified, foundation, in, a, series, of, works, completed, from, 1911, to, 1913, planck, reformulated, his, 1900, quantum, theory, and, introduced, the, idea, of, zero, point, energy, in, his, second, quantum, theory, soon, this, idea, attracted, the, attention, of, einstein, and, his, assistant, otto, stern, assuming, the, energy, of, rotating, diatomic, molecules, contains, zero, point, energy, they, then, compared, the, theoretical, specific, heat, of, hydrogen, gas, with, the, experimental, data, the, numbers, matched, nicely, however, after, publishing, the, findings, they, promptly, withdrew, their, support, because, they, no, longer, had, confidence, in, the, correctness, of, the, idea, of, zero, point, energy, in, 1917, at, the, height, of, his, work, on, relativity, einstein, published, an, article, in, physikalische, zeitschrift, that, proposed, the, possibility, of, stimulated, emission, the, physical, process, that, makes, possible, the, maser, and, the, laser, this, article, showed, that, the, statistics, of, absorption, and, emission, of, light, would, only, be, consistent, with, planck, s, distribution, law, if, the, emission, of, light, into, a, mode, with, n, photons, would, be, enhanced, statistically, compared, to, the, emission, of, light, into, an, empty, mode, this, paper, was, enormously, influential, in, the, later, development, of, quantum, mechanics, because, it, was, the, first, paper, to, show, that, the, statistics, of, atomic, transitions, had, simple, laws, einstein, discovered, louis, de, broglie, s, work, and, supported, his, ideas, which, were, received, skeptically, at, first, in, another, major, paper, from, this, era, einstein, observed, that, de, broglie, waves, could, explain, the, quantization, rules, of, bohr, and, sommerfeld, this, paper, would, inspire, schr, dinger, s, work, of, 1926, einstein, played, a, major, role, in, developing, quantum, theory, beginning, with, his, 1905, paper, on, the, photoelectric, effect, however, he, became, displeased, with, modern, quantum, mechanics, as, it, had, evolved, after, 1925, despite, its, acceptance, by, other, physicists, he, was, skeptical, that, the, randomness, of, quantum, mechanics, was, fundamental, rather, than, the, result, of, determinism, stating, that, god, is, not, playing, at, dice, until, the, end, of, his, life, he, continued, to, maintain, that, quantum, mechanics, was, incomplete, the, bohr, einstein, debates, were, a, series, of, public, disputes, about, quantum, mechanics, between, einstein, and, niels, bohr, who, were, two, of, its, founders, their, debates, are, remembered, because, of, their, importance, to, the, philosophy, of, science, their, debates, would, influence, later, interpretations, of, quantum, mechanics, einstein, never, fully, accepted, quantum, mechanics, while, he, recognized, that, it, made, correct, predictions, he, believed, a, more, fundamental, description, of, nature, must, be, possible, over, the, years, he, presented, multiple, arguments, to, this, effect, but, the, one, he, preferred, most, dated, to, a, debate, with, bohr, in, 1930, einstein, suggested, a, thought, experiment, in, which, two, objects, are, allowed, to, interact, and, then, moved, apart, a, great, distance, from, each, other, the, quantum, mechanical, description, of, the, two, objects, is, a, mathematical, entity, known, as, a, wavefunction, if, the, wavefunction, that, describes, the, two, objects, before, their, interaction, is, given, then, the, schr, dinger, equation, provides, the, wavefunction, that, describes, them, after, their, interaction, but, because, of, what, would, later, be, called, quantum, entanglement, measuring, one, object, would, lead, to, an, instantaneous, change, of, the, wavefunction, describing, the, other, object, no, matter, how, far, away, it, is, moreover, the, choice, of, which, measurement, to, perform, upon, the, first, object, would, affect, what, wavefunction, could, result, for, the, second, object, einstein, reasoned, that, no, influence, could, propagate, from, the, first, object, to, the, second, instantaneously, fast, indeed, he, argued, physics, depends, on, being, able, to, tell, one, thing, apart, from, another, and, such, instantaneous, influences, would, call, that, into, question, because, the, true, physical, condition, of, the, second, object, could, not, be, immediately, altered, by, an, action, done, to, the, first, einstein, concluded, the, wavefunction, could, not, be, that, true, physical, condition, only, an, incomplete, description, of, it, a, more, famous, version, of, this, argument, came, in, 1935, when, einstein, published, a, paper, with, boris, podolsky, and, nathan, rosen, that, laid, out, what, would, become, known, as, the, epr, paradox, in, this, thought, experiment, two, particles, interact, in, such, a, way, that, the, wavefunction, describing, them, is, entangled, then, no, matter, how, far, the, two, particles, were, separated, a, precise, position, measurement, on, one, particle, would, imply, the, ability, to, predict, perfectly, the, result, of, measuring, the, position, of, the, other, particle, likewise, a, precise, momentum, measurement, of, one, particle, would, result, in, an, equally, precise, prediction, for, of, the, momentum, of, the, other, particle, without, needing, to, disturb, the, other, particle, in, any, way, they, argued, that, no, action, taken, on, the, first, particle, could, instantaneously, affect, the, other, since, this, would, involve, information, being, transmitted, faster, than, light, which, is, forbidden, by, the, theory, of, relativity, they, invoked, a, principle, later, known, as, the, epr, criterion, of, reality, positing, that, if, without, in, any, way, disturbing, a, system, we, can, predict, with, certainty, i, e, with, probability, equal, to, unity, the, value, of, a, physical, quantity, then, there, exists, an, element, of, reality, corresponding, to, that, quantity, from, this, they, inferred, that, the, second, particle, must, have, a, definite, value, of, both, position, and, of, momentum, prior, to, either, quantity, being, measured, but, quantum, mechanics, considers, these, two, observables, incompatible, and, thus, does, not, associate, simultaneous, values, for, both, to, any, system, einstein, podolsky, and, rosen, therefore, concluded, that, quantum, theory, does, not, provide, a, complete, description, of, reality, in, 1964, john, stewart, bell, carried, the, analysis, of, quantum, entanglement, much, further, he, deduced, that, if, measurements, are, performed, independently, on, the, two, separated, particles, of, an, entangled, pair, then, the, assumption, that, the, outcomes, depend, upon, hidden, variables, within, each, half, implies, a, mathematical, constraint, on, how, the, outcomes, on, the, two, measurements, are, correlated, this, constraint, would, later, be, called, a, bell, inequality, bell, then, showed, that, quantum, physics, predicts, correlations, that, violate, this, inequality, consequently, the, only, way, that, hidden, variables, could, explain, the, predictions, of, quantum, physics, is, if, they, are, nonlocal, which, is, to, say, that, somehow, the, two, particles, are, able, to, interact, instantaneously, no, matter, how, widely, they, ever, become, separated, bell, argued, that, because, an, explanation, of, quantum, phenomena, in, terms, of, hidden, variables, would, require, nonlocality, the, epr, paradox, is, resolved, in, the, way, which, einstein, would, have, liked, least, despite, this, and, although, einstein, personally, found, the, argument, in, the, epr, paper, overly, complicated, that, paper, became, among, the, most, influential, papers, published, in, physical, review, it, is, considered, a, centerpiece, of, the, development, of, quantum, information, theory, encouraged, by, his, success, with, general, relativity, einstein, sought, an, even, more, ambitious, geometrical, theory, that, would, treat, gravitation, and, electromagnetism, as, aspects, of, a, single, entity, in, 1950, he, described, his, unified, field, theory, in, a, scientific, american, article, titled, on, the, generalized, theory, of, gravitation, his, attempt, to, find, the, most, fundamental, laws, of, nature, won, him, praise, but, not, success, a, particularly, conspicuous, blemish, of, his, model, was, that, it, did, not, accommodate, the, strong, and, weak, nuclear, forces, neither, of, which, was, well, understood, until, many, years, after, his, death, although, most, researchers, now, believe, that, einstein, s, approach, to, unifying, physics, was, mistaken, his, goal, of, a, theory, of, everything, is, one, to, which, his, successors, still, aspire, einstein, conducted, other, investigations, that, were, unsuccessful, and, abandoned, these, pertain, to, force, superconductivity, and, other, research, in, addition, to, longtime, collaborators, leopold, infeld, nathan, rosen, peter, bergmann, and, others, einstein, also, had, some, one, shot, collaborations, with, various, scientists, in, 1908, owen, willans, richardson, predicted, that, a, change, in, the, magnetic, moment, of, a, free, body, will, cause, this, body, to, rotate, this, effect, is, a, consequence, of, the, conservation, of, angular, momentum, and, is, strong, enough, to, be, observable, in, ferromagnetic, materials, einstein, and, wander, johannes, de, haas, published, two, papers, in, 1915, claiming, the, first, experimental, observation, of, the, effect, measurements, of, this, kind, demonstrate, that, the, phenomenon, of, magnetization, is, caused, by, the, alignment, polarization, of, the, angular, momenta, of, the, electrons, in, the, material, along, the, axis, of, magnetization, these, measurements, also, allow, the, separation, of, the, two, contributions, to, the, magnetization, that, which, is, associated, with, the, spin, and, with, the, orbital, motion, of, the, electrons, the, einstein, de, haas, experiment, is, the, only, experiment, concived, realized, and, published, by, albert, einstein, himself, a, complete, original, version, of, the, einstein, de, haas, experimental, equipment, was, donated, by, geertruida, de, haas, lorentz, wife, of, de, haas, and, daughter, of, lorentz, to, the, amp, re, museum, in, lyon, france, in, 1961, where, it, is, currently, on, display, it, was, lost, among, the, museum, s, holdings, and, was, rediscovered, in, 2023, in, 1926, einstein, and, his, former, student, le, szil, rd, co, invented, and, in, 1930, patented, the, einstein, refrigerator, this, absorption, refrigerator, was, then, revolutionary, for, having, no, moving, parts, and, using, only, heat, as, an, input, on, 11, november, 1930, u, s, patent, 1, 781, 541, was, awarded, to, einstein, and, le, szil, rd, for, the, refrigerator, their, invention, was, not, immediately, put, into, commercial, production, but, the, most, promising, of, their, patents, were, acquired, by, the, swedish, company, electrolux, einstein, also, invented, an, electromagnetic, pump, sound, reproduction, device, and, several, other, household, devices, while, traveling, einstein, wrote, daily, to, his, wife, elsa, and, adopted, stepdaughters, margot, and, ilse, the, letters, were, included, in, the, papers, bequeathed, to, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, margot, einstein, permitted, the, personal, letters, to, be, made, available, to, the, public, but, requested, that, it, not, be, done, until, twenty, years, after, her, death, she, died, in, 1986, barbara, wolff, of, the, hebrew, university, s, albert, einstein, archives, told, the, bbc, that, there, are, about, 3, 500, pages, of, private, correspondence, written, between, 1912, and, 1955, einstein, s, right, of, publicity, was, litigated, in, 2015, in, a, federal, district, court, in, california, although, the, court, initially, held, that, the, right, had, expired, that, ruling, was, immediately, appealed, and, the, decision, was, later, vacated, in, its, entirety, the, underlying, claims, between, the, parties, in, that, lawsuit, were, ultimately, settled, the, right, is, enforceable, and, the, hebrew, university, of, jerusalem, is, the, exclusive, representative, of, that, right, corbis, successor, to, the, roger, richman, agency, licenses, the, use, of, his, name, and, associated, imagery, as, agent, for, the, university, mount, einstein, in, the, chugach, mountains, of, alaska, was, named, in, 1955, mount, einstein, in, new, zealand, s, paparoa, range, was, named, after, him, in, 1970, by, the, department, of, scientific, and, industrial, research, einstein, became, one, of, the, most, famous, scientific, celebrities, after, the, confirmation, of, his, general, theory, of, relativity, in, 1919, although, most, of, the, public, had, little, understanding, of, his, work, he, was, widely, recognized, and, admired, in, the, period, before, world, war, ii, the, new, yorker, published, a, vignette, in, their, the, talk, of, the, town, feature, saying, that, einstein, was, so, well, known, in, america, that, he, would, be, stopped, on, the, street, by, people, wanting, him, to, explain, that, theory, eventually, he, came, to, cope, with, unwanted, enquirers, by, pretending, to, be, someone, else, pardon, me, sorry, always, i, am, mistaken, for, professor, einstein, einstein, has, been, the, subject, of, or, inspiration, for, many, novels, films, plays, and, works, of, music, he, is, a, favorite, model, for, depictions, of, absent, minded, professors, his, expressive, face, and, distinctive, hairstyle, have, been, widely, copied, and, exaggerated, time, magazine, s, frederic, golden, wrote, that, einstein, was, a, cartoonist, s, dream, come, true, many, popular, quotations, are, often, misattributed, to, him, einstein, received, numerous, awards, and, honors, and, in, 1922, he, was, awarded, the, 1921, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, services, to, theoretical, physics, and, especially, for, his, discovery, of, the, law, of, the, photoelectric, effect, none, of, the, nominations, in, 1921, met, the, criteria, set, by, alfred, nobel, so, the, 1921, prize, was, carried, forward, and, awarded, to, einstein, in, 1922, einsteinium, a, synthetic, chemical, element, was, named, in, his, honor, in, 1955, a, few, months, after, his, death
