charles, hermite, french, pronunciation, frs, frse, mias, 24, december, 1822, 14, january, 1901, was, a, french, mathematician, who, did, research, concerning, number, theory, quadratic, forms, invariant, theory, orthogonal, polynomials, elliptic, functions, and, algebra, hermite, polynomials, hermite, interpolation, hermite, normal, form, hermitian, operators, and, cubic, hermite, splines, are, named, in, his, honor, one, of, his, students, was, henri, poincar, he, was, the, first, to, prove, that, e, the, base, of, natural, logarithms, is, a, transcendental, number, his, methods, were, used, later, by, ferdinand, von, lindemann, to, prove, that, is, transcendental, hermite, was, born, in, dieuze, moselle, on, 24, december, 1822, with, a, deformity, in, his, right, foot, that, would, impair, his, gait, throughout, his, life, he, was, the, sixth, of, seven, children, of, ferdinand, hermite, and, his, wife, madeleine, n, e, lallemand, ferdinand, worked, in, the, drapery, business, of, madeleine, s, family, while, also, pursuing, a, career, as, an, artist, the, drapery, business, relocated, to, nancy, in, 1828, and, so, did, the, family, hermite, obtained, his, secondary, education, at, coll, ge, de, nancy, and, then, in, paris, at, coll, ge, henri, iv, and, at, the, lyc, e, louis, le, grand, he, read, some, of, joseph, louis, lagrange, s, writings, on, the, solution, of, numerical, equations, and, carl, friedrich, gauss, s, publications, on, number, theory, hermite, wanted, to, take, his, higher, education, at, cole, polytechnique, a, military, academy, renowned, for, excellence, in, mathematics, science, and, engineering, tutored, by, mathematician, eug, ne, charles, catalan, hermite, devoted, a, year, to, preparing, for, the, notoriously, difficult, entrance, examination, in, 1842, he, was, admitted, to, the, school, however, after, one, year, the, school, would, not, allow, hermite, to, continue, his, studies, there, because, of, his, deformed, foot, he, struggled, to, regain, his, admission, to, the, school, but, the, administration, imposed, strict, conditions, hermite, did, not, accept, this, and, he, quit, the, cole, polytechnique, without, graduating, in, 1842, nouvelles, annales, de, math, matiques, published, hermite, s, first, original, contribution, to, mathematics, a, simple, proof, of, niels, abel, s, proposition, concerning, the, impossibility, of, an, algebraic, solution, to, equations, of, the, fifth, degree, a, correspondence, with, carl, jacobi, begun, in, 1843, and, continued, the, next, year, resulted, in, the, insertion, in, the, complete, edition, of, jacobi, s, works, of, two, articles, by, hermite, one, concerning, the, extension, to, abelian, functions, of, one, of, the, theorems, of, abel, on, elliptic, functions, and, the, other, concerning, the, transformation, of, elliptic, functions, after, spending, five, years, working, privately, towards, his, degree, in, which, he, befriended, eminent, mathematicians, joseph, bertrand, carl, gustav, jacob, jacobi, and, joseph, liouville, he, took, and, passed, the, examinations, for, the, baccalaur, at, which, he, was, awarded, in, 1847, he, married, joseph, bertrand, s, sister, louise, bertrand, in, 1848, in, 1848, hermite, returned, to, the, cole, polytechnique, as, r, p, titeur, and, examinateur, d, admission, in, july, 1848, he, was, elected, to, the, french, academy, of, sciences, in, 1856, he, contracted, smallpox, through, the, influence, of, augustin, louis, cauchy, and, of, a, nun, who, nursed, him, he, resumed, the, practice, of, his, catholic, faith, from, 1862, to, 1873, he, was, lecturer, at, the, cole, normale, sup, rieure, in, 1869, he, succeeded, jean, marie, duhamel, as, professor, of, mathematics, both, at, the, cole, polytechnique, where, he, remained, until, 1876, and, at, the, university, of, paris, where, he, remained, until, his, death, upon, his, 70th, birthday, he, was, promoted, to, grand, officer, in, the, french, legion, of, honour, hermite, died, in, paris, on, 14, january, 1901, aged, 78, an, inspiring, teacher, hermite, strove, to, cultivate, admiration, for, simple, beauty, and, discourage, rigorous, minutiae, his, correspondence, with, thomas, stieltjes, testifies, to, the, great, aid, he, gave, those, beginning, scientific, life, his, published, courses, of, lectures, have, exercised, a, great, influence, his, important, original, contributions, to, pure, mathematics, published, in, the, major, mathematical, journals, of, the, world, dealt, chiefly, with, abelian, and, elliptic, functions, and, the, theory, of, numbers, in, 1858, hermite, showed, that, equations, of, the, fifth, degree, could, be, solved, by, elliptic, functions, in, 1873, he, proved, that, e, the, base, of, the, natural, system, of, logarithms, is, transcendental, techniques, similar, to, those, used, in, hermite, s, proof, of, e, s, transcendence, were, used, by, ferdinand, von, lindemann, in, 1882, to, show, that, is, transcendental, the, following, is, a, list, of, his, works, there, exists, if, i, am, not, mistaken, an, entire, world, which, is, the, totality, of, mathematical, truths, to, which, we, have, access, only, with, our, mind, just, as, a, world, of, physical, reality, exists, the, one, like, the, other, independent, of, ourselves, both, of, divine, creation, i, shall, risk, nothing, on, an, attempt, to, prove, the, transcendence, of, if, others, undertake, this, enterprise, no, one, will, be, happier, than, i, in, their, success, but, believe, me, it, will, not, fail, to, cost, them, some, effort, while, speaking, m, bertrand, is, always, in, motion, now, he, seems, in, combat, with, some, outside, enemy, now, he, outlines, with, a, gesture, of, the, hand, the, figures, he, studies, plainly, he, sees, and, he, is, eager, to, paint, this, is, why, he, calls, gesture, to, his, aid, with, m, hermite, it, is, just, the, opposite, his, eyes, seem, to, shun, contact, with, the, world, it, is, not, without, it, is, within, he, seeks, the, vision, of, truth, reading, one, of, great, discoveries, i, should, fancy, evidently, a, delusion, that, however, magnificent, one, ought, to, have, found, it, long, before, while, such, memoirs, of, hermite, as, the, one, referred, to, in, the, text, arouse, in, me, the, idea, what, magnificent, results, how, could, he, dream, of, such, a, thing, i, turn, with, terror, and, horror, from, this, lamentable, scourge, of, continuous, functions, with, no, derivatives, in, addition, to, the, mathematics, properties, named, in, his, honor, the, hermite, crater, near, the, moon, s, north, pole, is, named, after, hermite, this, article, incorporates, text, from, a, publication, now, in, the, public,
