young, tenor, named, luciano, pavarotti, during, the, 1970s, sutherland, strove, to, improve, her, diction, which, had, often, been, criticised, and, increase, the, expressiveness, of, her, interpretations, she, continued, to, add, dramatic, bel, canto, roles, to, her, repertoire, such, as, donizetti, s, maria, stuarda, and, lucrezia, borgia, as, well, as, massenet, s, esclarmonde, with, pavarotti, she, made, a, studio, recording, of, turandot, in, 1972, conducted, by, zubin, mehta, though, she, never, performed, the, role, on, stage, sutherland, s, early, recordings, show, her, to, be, possessed, of, a, crystal, clear, voice, and, excellent, diction, however, by, the, early, 1960s, her, voice, lost, some, of, this, clarity, in, the, middle, register, and, she, often, came, under, fire, for, having, unclear, diction, some, have, attributed, this, to, sinus, surgery, however, her, major, sinus, surgery, was, done, in, 1959, immediately, after, her, breakthrough, lucia, at, covent, garden, in, fact, her, first, commercial, recording, of, the, first, and, final, scene, of, lucia, reveals, her, voice, and, diction, to, be, just, as, clear, as, prior, to, the, sinus, procedure, her, husband, richard, bonynge, stated, in, an, interview, that, her, mushy, diction, occurred, while, striving, to, achieve, perfect, legato, according, to, him, it, is, because, she, earlier, had, a, very, germanic, un, legato, way, of, singing, during, the, 1980s, sutherland, added, anna, bolena, amalia, in, i, masnadieri, and, adriana, lecouvreur, to, her, repertoire, and, repeated, esclarmonde, at, the, royal, opera, house, performances, in, november, and, december, 1983, her, last, full, length, dramatic, performance, was, as, marguerite, de, valois, les, huguenots, at, the, sydney, opera, house, in, 1990, at, the, age, of, 63, where, she, sang, home, sweet, home, for, her, encore, her, last, public, appearance, however, took, place, in, a, gala, performance, of, die, fledermaus, on, new, year, s, eve, 1990, at, covent, garden, where, she, was, accompanied, by, her, colleagues, luciano, pavarotti, and, the, mezzo, soprano, marilyn, horne, according, to, her, own, words, given, in, an, interview, with, the, guardian, newspaper, in, 2002, her, biggest, achievement, was, to, sing, the, title, role, in, esclarmonde, she, considered, those, performances, and, recordings, her, best, after, retirement, sutherland, made, relatively, few, public, appearances, preferring, a, quiet, life, at, her, home, in, les, avants, switzerland, one, exception, was, her, 1994, address, at, a, lunch, organised, by, australians, for, constitutional, monarchy, when, sutherland, commented, it, also, upsets, me, that, it, is, such, a, damned, job, to, get, an, australian, passport, now, you, have, to, go, to, be, interviewed, by, a, chinese, or, an, indian, i, m, not, particularly, racist, but, i, find, it, ludicrous, her, criticism, caused, controversy, on, 3, july, 2008, she, fell, and, broke, both, legs, while, gardening, at, her, home, in, switzerland, sutherland, had, a, leading, role, as, mother, rudd, in, the, 1995, comedy, film, dad, and, dave, on, our,

and, with, the, covent, garden, company, in, london, to, her, daunting, schedule, at, most, of, the, major, opera, houses, of, the, world, we, read, endlessly, of, where, when, and, with, whom, she, sang, which, roles, we, re, shown, a, sensible, woman, and, a, hard, working, artist, with, a, healthy, ego, tempered, by, a, sense, of, humor, that, is, often, self, deprecating, the, work, includes, a, complete, list, of, all, her, performances, with, full, cast, lists, her, official, biography, joan, sutherland, the, authorised, biography, published, in, february, 1994, was, written, by, norma,

to, the, guardian, in, which, she, lamented, the, lack, of, technique, in, young, opera, singers, and, the, dearth, of, good, teachers, by, this, time, she, was, no, longer, giving, master, classes, herself, when, asked, by, italian, journalists, in, may, 2007, why, this, was, she, replied, because, i, m, 80, years, old, and, i, really, don, t, want, to, have, anything, to, do, with, opera, any, more, although, i, do, sit, on, the, juries, of, singing, competitions, the, cardiff, singer, of, the, world, competition, was, the, one, that, sutherland, was, most, closely, associated, with, after, her, retirement, she, began, her, regular, involvement, with, the, event, in, 1993, serving, on, the, jury, five, consecutive, times, and, later, in, 2003, becoming, its, patron, on, 11, october, 2010, sutherland, s, family, announced, that, she, had, died, at, her, home, at, les, avants, in, switzerland, the, previous, day, of, cardiopulmonary, failure, the, heart, just, gave, out, when, it, came, to, the, point, that, she, physically, couldn, t, do, anything, she, didn, t, want, to, live, any, more, she, wanted, to, go, she, was, happy, to, go, and, in, the, end, she, died, very, very, peacefully, though, she, recovered, from, her, fall, in, 2008, it, led, to, more, serious, health, problems, a, statement, from, her, family, said, she, s, had, a, long, life, and, gave, a, lot, of, pleasure, to, a, lot, of, people, sutherland, had, requested, a, small, private, funeral, service, her, funeral, was, held, on, 14, october, and, opera, australia, planned, a, tribute, to, her, artistic, director, of, opera, australia, lyndon, terracini, said, we, won, t, see, her, like, again, she, had, a, phenomenal, range, size, and, quality, of, voice, we, simply, don, t, hear, that, any, more, sutherland, is, survived, by, her, husband, son, daughter, in, law, and, two, grandchildren, australian, prime, minister, julia, gillard, said, she, was, of, course, one, of, the, great, opera, voices, of, the, 20th, century, adding, that, sutherland, showed, a, lot, of, quintessential, australian, values, she, was, described, as, down, to, earth, despite, her, status, as, a, diva, on, behalf, of, all, australians, i, would, like, to, extend, my, condolences, to, her, husband, richard, and, son, adam, and, their, extended, family, at, this, difficult, time, i, know, many, australians, will, be, reflecting, on, her, life, s, work, today, a, state, memorial, service, on, 9, november, 2010, arranged, by, opera, australia, was, held, at, the, sydney, opera, house, speakers, at, the, service, were, julia, gillard, prime, minister, of, australia, professor, marie, bashir, the, governor, of, new, south, wales, moffatt, oxenbould, the, former, artistic, director, of, opera, australia, and, sutherland, s, son, adam, bonynge, the, service, was, broadcast, live, by, both, abc1, television, and, abc, classic, fm, radio, and, streamed, globally, by, abc, news, 24, further, memorial, services, were, held, in, westminster, abbey, on, 15, february, 2011, and, in, new, york, city, on, 24, may, 2011, which, was, hosted, by, marilyn, horne, with, an, appearance, by, richard, bonynge, in, attendance, were, sherrill, milnes, norman, ayrton, regina, resnik, and, spiro, malas, described, as, fresh, silvery, and, bell, like, until, 1963, joan, sutherland, s, voice, later, became, golden, and, warm, music, critic, john, yohalem, writes, it, was, like, molten, honey, caressing, the, line, in, his, book, voices, singers, and, critics, john, steane, writes, that, if, the, tonal, spectrum, ranges, from, bright, to, dark, sutherland, s, place, would, be, near, the, centre, which, is, no, doubt, another, reason, for, her, wide, appeal, according, to, john, yohalem, her, lower, register, was, a, cello, register, stradivarius, hued, her, voice, was, full, and, rounded, even, in, her, highest, notes, which, were, brilliant, but, sometimes, slightly, acid, in, 1971, time, writes, an, article, comparing, sutherland, and, beverly, sills, originally, bright, and, youthful, sounding, her, voice, darkened, as, she, transformed, herself, into, a, coloratura, there, is, a, suggestion, of, callas, famous, middle, register, in, sutherland, s, vocal, center, a, tone, that, sounds, as, if, the, singer, were, singing, into, the, neck, of, a, resonant, bottle, today, the, sutherland, voice, towers, like, a, natural, wonder, unique, as, niagara, or, mount, everest, sills, voice, is, made, of, more, ordinary, stuff, what, she, shares, with, callas, is, an, abandon, in, hurling, herself, into, fiery, emotional, music, and, a, willingness, to, sacrifice, vocal, beauty, for, dramatic, effect, sutherland, deals, in, vocal, velvet, sills, in, emotional, dynamite, sutherland, s, voice, is, much, larger, but, its, plush, monochrome, robs, it, of, carrying, power, in, dramatic, moments, sills, multicolored, voice, though, smaller, projects, better, and, has, a, cutting, edge, that, can, slice, through, the, largest, orchestra, and, chorus, sometimes, indeed, it, verges, on, shrillness, in, slow, legato, music, sills, has, a, superior, sense, of, rhythm, and, clean, attack, to, keep, things, moving, sutherland, s, more, flaccid, beat, and, her, style, of, gliding, from, note, to, note, often, turn, song, into, somnolence, sills, diction, in, english, french, and, italian, is, superb, sutherland, s, vocal, placement, produces, mushy, diction, in, any, language, but, makes, possible, an, even, more, seamless, beauty, of, tone, than, is, available, to, sills, describing, sutherland, s, voice, john, yohalem, writes, on, my, personal, color, scale, which, runs, from, a, voluptuous, red, tebaldi, or, blood, orange, price, or, purple, caball, or, red, purple, troyanos, to, white, hot, rysanek, or, runny, yellow, green, sills, sutherland, is, among, the, blue, sopranos, which, has, nothing, to, do, with, blues, in, the, pop, sense, of, the, term, ella, fitzgerald, had, a, blue, voice, but, billie, holiday, had, a, blues, voice, which, is, very, different, diana, damrau, is, blue, mirella, freni, is, blue, ish, karita, mattila, is, ice, blue, r, gine, crespin, was, deep, blue, shading, to, violet, sutherland, was, true, blue, like, the, garter, ribbon, there, is, a, coolness, here, that, can, take, on, the, passion, in, the, music, but, does, not, inject, passion, where, the, music, lacks, it, could, possibly, use, it, although, she, is, generally, described, as, a, dramatic, coloratura, soprano, categorizing, sutherland, s, voice, has, always, been, extremely, difficult, both, the, size, and, the, sound, present, definitional, problems, aside, from, singing, some, roles, popular, among, coloratura, sopranos, sutherland, s, voice, could, not, be, more, different, in, a, 1961, profile, in, the, new, york, times, magazine, sutherland, said, she, initially, had, a, big, rather, wild, voice, that, was, not, heavy, enough, for, wagner, although, she, did, not, realise, this, until, she, heard, wagner, sung, as, it, should, be, regarding, the, size, of, sutherland, s, voice, opera, britannia, praise, a, voice, of, truly, heroic, dimensions, singing, bel, canto, it, is, doubtful, if, any, soprano, in, this, repertoire, has, fielded, quite, so, much, power, and, tone, as, dame, joan, and, this, includes, callas, and, tetrazzini, the, contrast, with, other, sopranos, who, sing, the, same, roles, is, appropriately, enough, stupendous, with, rival, prima, donnas, producing, small, pin, points, of, sound, as, compared, to, sutherland, s, seemingly, endless, cascades, of, full, tone, in, 1972, music, critic, winthrop, sargeant, describes, her, voice, as, large, as, that, of, a, top, ranking, wagnerian, soprano, in, the, new, yorker, french, soprano, natalie, dessay, states, she, had, a, huge, huge, voice, and, she, was, able, to, lighten, suddenly, and, to, take, this, quick, coloratura, and, she, had, also, the, top, high, notes, like, a, coloratura, soprano, but, with, a, big, huge, voice, which, is, very, rare, sutherland, s, vocal, range, extended, from, g, below, the, staff, g, 3, to, high, f, f, 6, or, high, f, sharp, f, 6, although, she, never, sang, this, last, note, in, a, public, performance, during, her, career, and, after, sutherland, received, many, honours, and, awards, she, was, made, a, commander, of, the, order, of, the, british, empire, cbe, in, the, 1961, birthday, honours, that, year, she, was, named, the, australian, of, the, year, sutherland, is, a,
