knowledge, of, the, flora, and, fauna, of, the, canadian, wilderness, and, by, his, warnings, of, ecological, disaster, should, the, delicate, balance, between, them, be, destroyed, the, idea, that, mankind, was, endangering, nature, by, recklessly, despoiling, and, plundering, its, riches, was, unheard, of, at, the, time, but, it, is, one, that, has, remained, part, of, dave, s, own, credo, to,

interesting, things, such, good, fortune, after, leaving, the, navy, attenborough, took, a, position, editing, children, s, science, textbooks, for, a, publishing, company, he, soon, became, disillusioned, with, the, work, and, in, 1950, applied, for, a, job, as, a, radio, talk, producer, with, the, bbc, although, he, was, rejected, for, this, job, his, cv, later, attracted, the, interest, of, mary, adams, head, of, the, talks, factual, broadcasting, department, of, the, bbc, s, fledgling, television, service, attenborough, like, most, britons, at, that, time, did, not, own, a, television, and, he, had, seen, only, one, programme, in, his, life, he, accepted, adams, offer, of, a, three, month, training, course, in, 1952, he, joined, the, bbc, full, time, initially,

and, they, decided, to, make, a, series, about, an, animal, collecting, expedition, the, result, was, zoo, quest, first, broadcast, in, 1954, where, attenborough, became, the, presenter, at, short, notice, due, to, lester, being, taken, ill, in, 1957, the, bbc, natural, history, unit, was, formally, established, in, bristol, attenborough, was, asked, to, join, it, but, declined, not, wishing, to, move, from, london, where, he, and, his, young, family, were, settled, instead, he, formed, his, own, department, the, travel, and, exploration, unit, which, allowed, him, to, continue, to, front, zoo, quest, as, well, as, produce, other, documentaries, notably, the, travellers, tales, and, adventure, series, in, the, early, 1960s, attenborough, resigned, from, the, permanent, staff, of, the, bbc, to, study, for, a, postgraduate, degree, in, social, anthropology, at, the, london, school, of, economics, interweaving, his, study, with, further, filming, however, he, accepted, an, invitation, to, return, to, the, bbc, as, controller, of, bbc, two, before, he, could, finish, the, degree, attenborough, became, controller, of, bbc, two, in, march, 1965, succeeding, michael, peacock, he, had, a, clause, inserted, in, his, contract, that, would, allow, him, to, continue, making, programmes, on, an, occasional, basis, later, the, same, year, he, filmed, elephants, in, tanzania, and, in, 1969, he, made, a, three, part, series, on, the, cultural, history, of, the, indonesian, island, of, bali, for, the, 1971, film, a, blank, on, the, map, he, joined, the, first, western, expedition, to, a, remote, highland, valley, in, new, guinea, to, seek, out, a, lost, tribe, bbc, two, was, launched, in, 1964, but, had, struggled, to, capture, the, public, s, imagination, when, attenborough, arrived, as, controller, he, quickly, abolished, the, channel, s, quirky, kangaroo, mascot, and, shook, up, the, schedule, with, a, mission, to, make, bbc, two, s, output, diverse, and, different, from, that, offered, by, other, networks, he, began, to, establish, a, portfolio, of, programmes, that, defined, the, channel, s, identity, for, decades, to, come, under, his, tenure, music, the, arts, entertainment, archaeology, experimental, comedy, travel, drama, sport, business, science, and, natural, history, all, found, a, place, in, the, weekly, schedules, often, an, eclectic, mix, was, offered, within, a, single, evening, s, viewing, programmes, he, commissioned, included, man, alive, call, my, bluff, chronicle, match, of, the, day, the, old, grey, whistle, test, monty, python, s, flying, circus, and, the, money, programme, with, the, advent, of, colour, television, attenborough, brought, snooker, to, the, bbc, to, show, the, benefits, of, the, format, as, the, sport, uses, coloured, balls, the, show, pot, black, was, later, credited, with, the, boom, of, the, sport, into, the, 1980s, one, of, his, most, significant, decisions, was, to, order, a, 13, part, series, on, the, history, of, western, art, to, show, off, the, quality, of, the, new, uhf, colour, television, service, that, bbc, two, offered, broadcast, to, universal, acclaim, in, 1969, civilisation, set, the, blueprint, for, landmark, authored, documentaries, which, were, informally, known, as, sledgehammer, projects, others, followed, including, jacob, bronowski, s, the, ascent, of, man, also, commissioned, by, attenborough, and, alistair, cooke, s, america, attenborough, thought, that, the, story, of, evolution, would, be, a, natural, subject, for, such, a, series, he, shared, his, idea, with, christopher, parsons, a, producer, at, the, natural, history, unit, who, came, up, with, a, title, life, on, earth, and, returned, to, bristol, to, start, planning, the, series, attenborough, harboured, a, strong, desire, to, present, the, series, himself, but, this, would, not, be, possible, so, long, as, he, remained, in, a, management, post, while, in, charge, of, bbc, two, attenborough, turned, down, terry, wogan, s, job, application, to, be, a, presenter, on, the, channel, stating, that, there, weren, t, any, suitable, vacancies, the, channel, already, had, an, irish, announcer, with, attenborough, reflecting, in, 2016, to, have, had, two, irishmen, presenting, on, bbc, two, would, have, looked, ridiculous, this, is, no, comment, whatsoever, on, terry, wogan, s, talents, attenborough, has, also, acknowledged, that, he, sanctioned, the, wiping, of, television, output, during, this, period, to, cut, costs, including, a, series, by, alan, bennett, which, he, later, regretted, in, 1969, attenborough, was, promoted, to, director, of, programmes, making, him, responsible, for, the, output, of, both, bbc, channels, his, tasks, which, included, agreeing, budgets, attending, board, meetings, and, firing, staff, were, now, far, removed, from, the, business, of, filming, programmes, when, attenborough, s, name, was, being, suggested, as, a, candidate, for, the, position, of, director, general, of, the, bbc, in, 1972, he, phoned, his, brother, richard, to, confess, that, he, had, no, appetite, for, the, job, early, the, following, year, he, left, his, post, to, return, to, full, time, programme, making, leaving, him, free, to, write, and, present, the, planned, natural, history, epic, after, his, resignation, attenborough, became, a, freelance, broadcaster, and, started, work, on, his, next, project, a, trip, to, indonesia, with, a, crew, from, the, natural, history, unit, it, resulted, in, the, 1973, series, eastwards, with, attenborough, which, was, similar, in, tone, to, the, earlier, zoo, quest, the, main, difference, was, the, introduction, of, colour, attenborough, stated, that, he, wanted, to, work, in, asia, because, previous, nature, documentaries, had, mostly, focused, on, africa, that, year, attenborough, was, invited, to, deliver, the, royal, institution, christmas, lecture, on, the, language, of, animals, after, his, work, on, eastwards, with, attenborough, he, began, to, work, on, the, scripts, for, life, on, earth, due, to, the, scale, of, his, ambition, the, bbc, decided, to, partner, with, an, american, network, to, secure, the, necessary, funding, while, the, negotiations, were, proceeding, he, worked, on, a, number, of, other, television, projects, he, presented, a, series, on, tribal, art, the, tribal, eye, 1975, and, another, on, the, voyages, of, discovery, the, explorers, 1975, he, presented, a, bbc, children, s, series, about, cryptozoology, entitled, fabulous, animals, 1975, which, featured, mythical, creatures, such, as, mermaids, and, unicorns, eventually, the, bbc, signed, a, co, production, deal, with, turner, broadcasting, and, life, on, earth, moved, into, production, in, 1976, in, 1979, he, visited, china, and, reported, to, the, west, for, the, first, time, about, china, s, one, child, policy, beginning, with, life, on, earth, in, 1979, attenborough, set, about, creating, a, body, of, work, which, became, a, benchmark, of, quality, in, wildlife, film, making, and, influenced, a, generation, of, documentary, film, makers, the, series, established, many, of, the, hallmarks, of, the, bbc, s, natural, history, output, by, treating, his, subject, seriously, and, researching, the, latest, discoveries, attenborough, and, his, production, team, gained, the, trust, of, scientists, who, responded, by, allowing, him, to, feature, their, subjects, in, his, programmes, innovation, was, another, factor, in, life, on, earth, s, success, new, film, making, techniques, were, devised, to, get, the, shots, attenborough, wanted, with, a, focus, on, events, and, animals, that, were, up, till, then, unfilmed, international, air, travel, enabled, the, series, to, be, devised, so, that, attenborough, visited, several, locations, around, the, globe, in, each, episode, sometimes, even, changing, continents, in, one, sequence, although, appearing, as, the, on, screen, presenter, he, restricted, his, time, on, camera, to, give, more, time, to, his, subjects, five, years, after, the, success, of, life, on, earth, the, bbc, released, the, living, planet, this, time, attenborough, built, his, series, around, the, theme, of, ecology, the, adaptations, of, living, things, to, their, environment, it, was, another, critical, and, commercial, success, generating, huge, international, sales, for, the, bbc, in, 1990, the, trials, of, life, completed, the, original, life, trilogy, looking, at, animal, behaviour, through, the, different, stages, of, life, in, the, 1990s, attenborough, continued, to, use, the, life, title, for, a, succession, of, authored, documentaries, in, 1993, he, presented, life, in, the, freezer, the, first, television, series, to, survey, the, natural, history, of, antarctica, although, past, normal, retirement, age, he, then, embarked, on, a, number, of, more, specialised, surveys, of, the, natural, world, beginning, with, plants, they, proved, a, difficult, subject, for, his, producers, who, had, to, deliver, hours, of, television, featuring, what, are, essentially, immobile, objects, the, result, was, the, private, life, of, plants, 1995, which, showed, plants, as, dynamic, organisms, by, using, time, lapse, photography, to, speed, up, their, growth, and, went, on, to, earn, a, peabody, award, prompted, by, an, enthusiastic, ornithologist, at, the, bbc, natural, history, unit, attenborough, then, turned, his, attention, to, birds, as, he, was, neither, a, birdwatcher, nor, a, bird, expert, he, decided, he, was, better, qualified, to, make, the, life, of, birds, 1998, on, the, theme, of, behaviour, the, documentary, series, won, a, second, peabody, award, the, following, year, the, order, of, the, remaining, life, series, was, dictated, by, developments, in, camera, technology, for, the, life, of, mammals, 2002, low, light, and, infrared, cameras, were, deployed, to, reveal, the, behaviour, of, nocturnal, mammals, the, series, contains, a, number, of, memorable, two, shots, of, attenborough, and, his, subjects, which, included, chimpanzees, a, blue, whale, and, a, grizzly, bear, advances, in, macro, photography, made, it, possible, to, capture, the, natural, behaviour, of, very, small, creatures, for, the, first, time, and, in, 2005, life, in, the, undergrowth, introduced, audiences, to, the, world, of, invertebrates, at, this, point, attenborough, realised, that, he, had, spent, 20, years, unconsciously, assembling, a, collection, of, programmes, on, all, the, major, groups, of, terrestrial, animals, and, plants, only, reptiles, and, amphibians, were, missing, when, life, in, cold, blood, was, broadcast, in, 2008, he, had, the, satisfaction, of, completing, the, set, brought, together, in, a, dvd, encyclopaedia, called, life, on, land, he, commented, the, evolutionary, history, is, finished, the, endeavour, is, complete, if, you, d, asked, me, 20, years, ago, whether, we, d, be, attempting, such, a, mammoth, task, i, d, have, said, don, t, be, ridiculous, these, programmes, tell, a, particular, story, and, i, m, sure, others, will, come, along, and, tell, it, much, better, than, i, did, but, i, do, hope, that, if, people, watch, it, in, 50, years, time, it, will, still, have, something, to, say, about, the, world, we, live, in, however, in, 2010, attenborough, asserted, that, his, first, life, dealing, with, evolutionary, history, before, life, on, earth, should, be, included, within, the, life, series, in, the, documentary, attenborough, s, journey, he, stated, this, series, to, a, degree, which, i, really, didn, t, fully, appreciate, until, i, started, working, on, it, really, completes, the, set, alongside, the, life, series, attenborough, continued, to, work, on, other, television, documentaries, mainly, in, the, natural, history, genre, he, wrote, and, presented, a, series, on, man, s, influence, on, the,

promoting, dynasties, he, said, that, repeated, messages, on, threats, to, wildlife, in, programming, could, be, a, turn, off, to, viewers, some, environmentalists, feel, that, programmes, like, attenborough, s, give, a, false, picture, of, idyllic, wilderness, and, do, not, do, enough, to, acknowledge, that, such, areas, are, increasingly, encroached, upon, by, humans, however, the,

for, more, debate, about, human, population, growth, saying, that, since, he, first, started, making, programmes, 60, years, ago, the, human, population, has, tripled, according, to, attenborough, improving, women, s, rights, around, the, world, is, an, effective, way, to, limit, our, birth, rate, he, said, that, anyone, who, thinks, that, you, can, have, infinite, growth, in, a, finite, environment, is, either, a, madman, or, an, economist, attenborough, considers, himself, an, agnostic, when, asked, whether, his, observation, of, the, natural, world, has, given, him, faith, in, a, creator, he, generally, responds, with, some, version, of, this, story, making, reference, to, the, onchocerca, volvulus, parasitic, worm, my, response, is, that, when, creationists, talk, about, god, creating, every, individual, species, as, a, separate, act, they, always, instance, hummingbirds, or, orchids, sunflowers, and, beautiful, things, but, i, tend, to, think, instead, of, a, parasitic, worm, that, is, boring, through, the, eye, of, a, boy, sitting, on, the, bank, of, a, river, in, west, africa, that, s, going, to, make, him, blind, and, are, you, telling, me, that, the, god, you, believe, in, who, you, also, say, is, an, all, merciful, god, who, cares, for, each, one, of, us, individually, are, you, saying, that, god, created, this, worm, that, can, live, in, no, other, way, than, in, an, innocent, child, s, eyeball, because, that, doesn, t, seem, to, me, to, coincide, with, a, god, who, s, full, of, mercy, he, has, explained, that, he, feels, the, evidence, all, over, the, planet, clearly, shows, evolution, to, be, the, best, way, to, explain, the, diversity, of, life, and, that, as, far, as, concerned, if, there, is, a, supreme, being, then, he, chose, organic, evolution, as, a, way, of, bringing, into, existence, the, natural, world, in, a, bbc, four, interview, with, mark, lawson, he, was, asked, if, he, at, any, time, had, any, religious, faith, he, replied, simply, no, he, said, it, never, really, occurred, to, me, to, believe, in, god, in, 2002, attenborough, joined, an, effort, by, leading, clerics, and, scientists, to, oppose, the, inclusion, of, creationism, in, the, curriculum, of, uk, state, funded, independent, schools, which, receive, private, sponsorship, such, as, the, emmanuel, schools, foundation, in, 2009, he, stated, that, the, book, of, genesis, by, saying, that, the, world, was, there, for, people, to, control, had, taught, generations, that, they, can, dominate, the, environment, and, that, this, has, resulted, in, the, devastation, of, vast, areas, of, the, environment, he, further, explained, to, the, science, journal, nature, that, s, why, darwinism, and, the, fact, of, evolution, is, of, great, importance, because, it, is, that, attitude, which, has, led, to, the, devastation, of, so, much, and, we, are, in, the, situation, that, we, are, in, also, in, early, 2009, the, bbc, broadcast, an, attenborough, one, hour, special, charles, darwin, and, the, tree, of, life, in, reference, to, the, programme, attenborough, stated, that, people, write, to, me, that, evolution, is, only, a, theory, well, it, is, not, a, theory, evolution, is, as, solid, a, historical, fact, as, you, could, conceive, evidence, from, every, quarter, what, is, a, theory, is, whether, natural, selection, is, the, mechanism, and, the, only, mechanism, that, is, a, theory, but, the, historical, reality, that, dinosaurs, led, to, birds, and, mammals, produced, whales, that, s, not, theory, he, strongly, opposes, creationism, and, its, offshoot, intelligent, design, saying, that, the, results, of, a, survey, that, found, a, quarter, of, science, teachers, in, state, schools, believe, that, creationism, should, be, taught, alongside, evolution, in, science, lessons, was, really, terrible, in, march, 2009, attenborough, appeared, on, friday, night, with, jonathan, ross, attenborough, stated, that, he, felt, evolution, did, not, rule, out, the, existence, of, a, god, and, accepted, the, title, of, agnostic, saying, my, view, is, i, don, t, know, one, way, or, the, other, but, i, don, t, think, that, evolution, is, against, a, belief, in, god, attenborough, has, joined, the, evolutionary, biologist, richard, dawkins, and, other, top, scientists, in, signing, a, campaign, statement, co, ordinated, by, the, british, humanist, association, bha, the, statement, calls, for, creationism, to, be, banned, from, the, school, science, curriculum, and, for, evolution, to, be, taught, more, widely, in, schools, attenborough, is, a, lifelong, supporter, of, the, bbc, public, service, broadcasting, and, the, television, licence, he, has, said, that, public, service, broadcasting, is, one, of, the, things, that, distinguishes, this, country, and, makes, me, want, to, live, here, and, believes, that, it, is, not, reducible, to, individual, programmes, but, can, only, effectively, operate, as, a, network, that, measures, its, success, not, only, by, its, audience, size, but, by, the, range, of, its, schedule, the, bbc, per, minute, in, almost, every, category, is, as, cheap, as, you, can, find, anywhere, in, the, world, and, produces, the, best, quality, the, bbc, has, gone, through, swingeing, staff, cuts, it, has, been, cut, to, the, bone, if, you, divert, licence, fee, money, elsewhere, you, cut, quality, and, services, there, is, a, lot, of, people, who, want, to, see, the, bbc, weakened, they, talk, of, this, terrible, tax, of, the, licence, fee, yet, it, is, the, best, bargain, that, is, going, four, radio, channels, and, god, knows, how, many, tv, channels, it, is, piffling, attenborough, expressed, the, view, that, there, had, often, been, people, wanting, to, remove, the, bbc, adding, there, s, always, been, trouble, about, the, licence, and, if, you, dropped, your, guard, you, could, bet, our, bottom, dollar, there, d, be, plenty, of, people, who, d, want, to, take, it, away, the, licence, fee, is, the, basis, on, which, the, bbc, is, based, and, if, you, destroy, it, broadcasting, becomes, a, wasteland, he, expressed, regret, at, some, of, the, changes, made, to, the, bbc, in, the, 1990s, by, its, director, general, john, birt, who, introduced, an, internal, market, at, the, corporation, slimmed, and, closed, some, departments, and, outsourced, much, of, the, corporation, s, output, to, private, production, companies, although, he, said, birt, s, policies, had, poor, results, attenborough, also, acknowledged, the, bbc, had, to, change, in, 2008, he, criticised, the, bbc, s, television, schedules, positing, that, the, two, senior, networks, bbc, one, and, bbc, two, which, attenborough, stated, were, first, set, up, as, a, partnership, now, schedule, simultaneously, programmes, of, identical, character, thereby, contradicting, the, very, reason, that, the, bbc, was, given, a, second, network, in, 1998, attenborough, described, himself, as, a, standard, boring, left, wing, liberal, and, expressed, the, view, that, the, market, economy, was, misery, in, 2013, attenborough, joined, the, rock, guitarists, brian, may, and, slash, in,

attenborough, criticised, excess, capitalism, as, a, driver, of, ecological, imbalance, stating, the, excesses, the, capitalist, system, has, brought, us, have, got, to, be, curbed, somehow, and, that, greed, does, not, actually, lead, to, joy, although, he, added, that, doesn, t, mean, to, say, that, capitalism, is, dead, he, also, lamented, the, lack, of, international, cooperation, on, climate, change, and, said, there, should, be, no, dominant, nation, on, this, planet, in, 2021, attenborough, told, the, leaders, of, the, 47th, g7, summit, that, tackling, climate, change, was, now,
