properly, demands, hitchcock, later, stated, that, he, thought, the, conventional, happy, ending, of, the, film, with, the, wife, discovering, her, husband, is, innocent, rather, than, his, being, guilty, and, she, letting, him, kill, her, with, a, glass, of, poisoned, milk, a, complete, mistake, because, of, making, that, story, with, cary, grant, unless, you, have, a, cynical, ending, it,

in, the, pride, and, the, passion, he, had, expressed, an, interest, in, playing, william, holden, s, character, in, the, bridge, on, the, river, kwai, at, the, time, but, found, that, it, was, not, possible, because, of, his, commitment, to, the, pride, and, the, passion, the, film, was, shot, on, location, in, spain, and, was, problematic, with, co, star, frank, sinatra, irritating, his, colleagues, and, leaving, the, production, after, just, a, few, weeks, although, grant, had, an, affair, with, loren, during, filming, grant, s, attempts, to, woo, loren, to, marry, him, during, the,

originally, sought, grant, for, the, role, of, james, bond, in, dr, no, 1962, but, discarded, the, idea, as, grant, would, be, committed, to, only, one, feature, film, therefore, the, producers, decided, to, go, after, someone, who, could, be, part, of, a, franchise, after, james, mason, would, only, agree, to, commit, to, three, films, in, 1963, grant, appeared, in, his, last, typically, suave, romantic, role, opposite, audrey, hepburn, in, charade, grant, found, the, experience, of, working, with, hepburn, wonderful, and, believed, that, their, close, relationship, was, clear, on, camera, though, according, to, hepburn, he, was, particularly, worried, during, the, filming, that, he, would, be, criticized, for, being, far, too, old, for, her, and, seen, as, a, cradle, snatcher, author, chris, barsanti, writes, it, s, the, film, s, canny, flirtatiousness, that, makes, it, such, ingenious, entertainment, grant, and, hepburn, play, off, each, other, like, the, pros, that, they, are, the, film, well, received, by, the, critics, is, often, called, the, best, hitchcock, film, hitchcock, never, made, in, 1964, grant, changed, from, his, typically, suave, distinguished, screen,

backdrop, of, the, housing, shortage, of, the, 1964, tokyo, olympics, newsweek, concluded, though, grant, s, personal, presence, is, indispensable, the, character, he, plays, is, almost, wholly, superfluous, perhaps, the, inference, to, be, taken, is, that, a, man, in, his, 50s, or, 60s, has, no, place, in, romantic, comedy, except, as, a, catalyst, if, so, the, chemistry, is, wrong, for, everyone, hitchcock, had, asked, grant, to, star, in, torn, curtain, that, year, only, to, learn, that, he, had, decided, to, retire, in, 1966, when, his, daughter, jennifer, grant, was, born, grant, retired, from, the, screen, so, he, could, focus, on, bringing, her, up, and, to, provide, a, sense, of, permanence, and, stability, in, her, life, he, had, become, increasingly, disillusioned, with, cinema, in, the, 1960s, rarely, finding, a, script, of, which, he, approved, he, remarked, i, could, have, gone, on, acting, and, playing, a, grandfather, or, a, bum, but, i, discovered, more, important, things, in, life, he, knew, after, he, had, made, charade, that, the, golden, age, of, hollywood, was, over, grant, expressed, little, interest, in, making, a, career, comeback, and, would, respond, to, the, suggestion, with, fat, chance, he, did, however, briefly, appear, in, the, audience, for, elvis, presley, s, 1970, las, vegas, concert, documentary, elvis, that, s, the, way, it, is, in, the, 1970s, he, was, given, the, negatives, from, a, number, of, his, films, and, he, sold, them, to, television, for, a, sum, of, over, 2, million, dollars, in, 1975, 11, 3, million, in, 2023, morecambe, and, stirling, argue, that, grant, s, absence, from, film, after, 1966, was, not, because, he, had, irrevocably, turned, his, back, on, the, film, industry, but, because, he, was, caught, between, a, decision, made, and, the, temptation, to, eat, a, bit, of, humble, pie, and, re, announce, himself, to, the, cinema, going, public, in, the, 1970s, mgm, was, keen, on, remaking, grand,

grant, was, in, good, health, until, he, had, a, mild, stroke, in, october, that, year, in, the, last, few, years, of, his, life, he, undertook, tours, of, the, united, states, in, the, one, man,

from, new, jersey, to, texas, and, his, audiences, ranged, from, elderly, film, buffs, to, enthusiastic, college, students, discovering, his, films, for, the, first, time, grant, admitted, that, the, appearances, were, ego, fodder, remarking, that, i, know, who, i, am, inside, and, outside, but, it, s, nice, to, have, the, outside, at, least, substantiated, stirling, refers, to, grant, as, one, of, the, shrewdest, businessmen, ever, to, operate, in, hollywood, his, long, term, friendship, with, howard, hughes, from, the, 1930s, onward, saw, him, invited, into, the, most, glamorous, circles, in, hollywood, and, their, lavish, parties, biographers, morecambe, and, stirling, state, that, hughes, played, a, major, role, in, the, development, of, grant, s, business, interests, so, that, by, 1939, he, was, already, an, astute, operator, with, various, commercial, interests, scott, also, played, a, role, encouraging, grant, to, invest, his, money, in, shares, making, him, a, wealthy, man, by, the, end, of, the, 1930s, in, the, 1940s, grant, and, barbara, hutton, invested, heavily, in, real, estate, development, in, acapulco, at, a, time, when, it, was, little, more, than, a, fishing, village, and, teamed, up, with, richard, widmark, roy, rogers, and, red, skelton, to, buy, a, hotel, there, behind, his, business, interests, was, a, particularly, intelligent, mind, to, the, point, that, his, friend, david, niven, once, said, before, computers, went, into, general, release, cary, had, one, in, his, brain, film, critic, david, thomson, believes, that, grant, s, intelligence, came, across, on, screen, and, stated, that, no, one, else, looked, so, good, and, so, intelligent, at, the, same, time, after, grant, retired, from, the, screen, he, became, more, active, in, business, he, accepted, a, position, on, the, board, of, directors, at, faberg, this, position, was, not, honorary, as, some, had, assumed, grant, regularly, attended, meetings, and, traveled, internationally, to, support, them, his, pay, was, modest, in, comparison, to, the, millions, of, his, film, career, a, salary, of, a, reported, 15, 000, a, year, such, was, grant, s, influence, on, the, company, that, george, barrie, once, claimed, that, grant, had, played, a, role, in, the, growth, of, the, firm, to, annual, revenues, of, about, 50, million, in, 1968, a, growth, of, nearly, 80, since, the, inaugural, year, in, 1964, the, position, also, permitted, the, use, of, a, private, plane, which, grant, could, use, to, fly, to, see, his, daughter, wherever, her, mother, dyan, cannon,

alec, one, of, the, wealthiest, stars, in, hollywood, grant, owned, houses, in, beverly, hills, malibu, and, palm, springs, he, was, immaculate, in, his, personal, grooming, and, edith, head, the, renowned, hollywood, costume, designer, appreciated, his, meticulous, attention, to, detail, and, considered, him, to, have, had, the, greatest, fashion, sense, of, any, actor, she, had, worked, with, mccann, attributed, his, almost, obsessive, maintenance, with, tanning, which, deepened, the, older, he, got, to, douglas, fairbanks, who, also, had, a, major, influence, on, his, refined, sense, of, dress, mccann, notes, that, because, grant, came, from, a, working, class, background, and, was, not, well, educated, he, made, a, particular, effort, over, the, course, of, his, career, to, mix, with, high, society, and, absorb, their, knowledge, manners, and, etiquette, his, image, was, meticulously, crafted, from, the, early, days, in, hollywood, where, he, would, frequently, sunbathe, he, avoided, being, photographed, smoking, despite, smoking, two, packs, a, day, at, the, time, grant, quit, smoking, in, the, early, 1950s, through, hypnotherapy, he, remained, health, conscious, staying, very, trim, and, athletic, even, into, his, late, career, though, he, claimed, that, he, never, crook, a, finger, to, keep, fit, saying, that, he, did, everything, in, moderation, except, making, love, grant, s, daughter, jennifer, said, that, her, father, made, hundreds, of, friends, from, all, walks, of, life, and, that, their, house, was, frequently, visited, by, the, likes, of, frank, and, barbara, sinatra, quincy, jones, gregory, peck, and, his, wife, veronique, johnny, carson, and, his, wife, kirk, kerkorian, and, merv, griffin, she, said, that, grant, and, sinatra, were, the, closest, of, friends, that, the, two, men, had, a, similar, radiance, and, indefinable, incandescence, of, charm, and, that, they, were, eternally, high, on, life, while, raising, jennifer, grant, archived, artifacts, of, her, childhood, and, adolescence, in, a, bank, quality, room, sized, vault, he, had, installed, in, the, house, jennifer, attributed, this, meticulous, collection, to, the, fact, that, artifacts, of, his, own, childhood, had, been, destroyed, during, the, luftwaffe, s, bombing, of, bristol, in, world, war, ii, an, event, that, also, claimed, the, lives, of, his, uncle, aunt, cousin, and, his, cousin, s, husband, and, grandson, and, he, may, have, wanted, to, prevent, her, from, experiencing, a, similar, loss, grant, lived, with, costume, designer, orry, kelly, from, 1925, to, 1931, in, the, west, village, new, york, until, both, moved, to, hollywood, they, met, when, grant, was, a, struggling, performer, who, had, just, been, evicted, from, a, boarding, house, for, nonpayment, they, had, a, volatile, on, and, off, relationship, over, three, decades, until, orry, kelly, died, in, 1964, when, grant, became, one, of, his, pallbearers, while, kelly, stops, short, of, claiming, that, grant, was, his, boyfriend, in, his, memoir, director, gillian, armstrong, s, documentary, on, kelly, s, memoir, states, so, outright, grant, lived, with,

shooting, sinners, in, the, sun, they, moved, in, together, soon, afterwards, whether, the, relationship, was, romantic, is, a, matter, of, biographical, dispute, certainly, the, association, was, critical, to, shaping, grant, s, star, persona, scott, who, hailed, from, wealth, was, polished, and, relaxed, grant, who, d, been, gauche, and, unsophisticated, would, adopt, these, traits, and, make, them, his, trademark, richard, blackwell, then, an, actor, at, rko, jerome, zerbe, a, photographer, who, shot, a, series, of, publicity, photographs, of, the, couple, in, their, home, and,

was, complete, biographer, and, friend, of, grant, s, bill, royce, claimed, that, in, old, age, grant, confessed, to, him, that, he, and, scott, had, been, bisexual, and, that, their, relationship, was, the, first, time, he, d, ever, been, in, love, characterising, the, memory, as, have, you, ever, heard, of, gravity, collapse, however, he, allegedly, also, told, royce, that, while, scott, had, loved, him, on, some, profound, level, scott, had, not, desired, him, physically, to, the, same, degree, but, that, they, had, explored, the, imbalance, of, their, attraction, since, grant, s, death, queer, journalists, such, as, david, canfield, writing, for, vanity, fair, have, revisited, the, rumours, and, speculation, grant, s, daughter, jennifer, has, denied, her, father, was, bisexual, when, chevy, chase, joked, on, television, in, 1980, that, grant, was, a, homo, what, a, gal, grant, sued, him, for, slander, and, chase, was, forced, to, retract, his, words, grant, became, a, fan, of,

of, psychoanalysis, radiologist, mortimer, hartman, began, treating, him, with, lsd, in, the, late, 1950s, with, grant, optimistic, that, it, could, make, him, feel, better, about, himself, and, rid, him, of, the, inner, turmoil, from, his, childhood, and, failed, relationships, he, had, an, estimated, 100, sessions, over, several, years, for, a, long, time, grant, viewed, the, drug, positively, saying, that, it, was, the, solution, after, many, years, of, searching, for, his, peace, of, mind, and, that, for, the, first, time, in, his, life, he, was, truly, deeply, and, honestly, happy, dyan, cannon, claimed, during, a, court, hearing, that, he, was, an, apostle, of, lsd, and, that, he, was, still, taking, the, drug, in, 1967, as, part, of, a, remedy, to, save, their, relationship, grant, later, remarked, that, taking, lsd, was, an, utterly, foolish, thing, to, do, but, i, was, a, self, opinionated, boor, hiding, all, kinds, of, layers, and, defences, hypocrisy, and, vanity, i, had, to, get, rid, of, them, and, wipe, the, slate, clean, grant, was, married, five, times, he, wed, virginia, cherrill, on, february, 9, 1934, at, the, caxton, hall, register, office, in, london, she,

against, the, blacklisting, of, his, friend, charlie, chaplin, during, the, period, of, mccarthyism, arguing, that, chaplin, was, not, a, communist, and, that, his, status, as, an, entertainer, was, more, important, than, his, political, beliefs, in, 1950, he, told, a, reporter, that, he, would, like, to, see, a, female, president, of, the, united, states, but, asserted, a, reluctance, to,

been, feeling, unwell, as, he, arrived, at, the, theater, basil, williams, photographed, him, there, and, thought, that, he, still, looked, his, usual, suave, self, but, he, noticed, that, he, seemed, very, tired, and, that, he, stumbled, once, in, the, auditorium, williams, recalls, that, grant, rehearsed, for, half, an, hour, before, something, seemed, wrong, all, of, a, sudden, and, he, disappeared, backstage, grant, was, taken, back, to, the, blackhawk, hotel, where, he, and, his, wife, had, checked, in, and, a, doctor, was, called, and, discovered, that, grant, was, having, a, massive, stroke, with, a, blood, pressure, reading, of, 210, over, 130, grant, refused, to, be, taken, to, the, hospital, the, doctor, recalled, the, stroke, was, getting, worse, in, only, fifteen, minutes, he, deteriorated, rapidly, it, was, terrible, watching, him, die, and, not, being, able, to, help, but, he, wouldn, t, let, us, by, 8, 45, p, m, grant, had, slipped, into, a, coma, and, was, taken, to, st, luke, s, hospital, in, davenport, iowa, he, spent, 45, minutes, in, the, emergency, room, before, being, transferred, to, intensive, care, he, died, at, 11, 22, pm, aged, 82, death, of, course, i, think, of, it, but, i, don, t, want, to, dwell, on, it, i, think, the, thing, you, think, about, when, you, re, my, age, is, how, you, re, going, to, do, it, and, whether, you, ll, behave, well, grant, at, age, 73, an, editorial, in, the, new, york, times, stated, cary, grant, was, not, supposed, to, die, cary, grant, was, supposed, to, stick, around, our, perpetual, touchstone, of, charm, and, elegance, and, romance, and, youth, his, body, was, taken, back, to, california, where, it, was, cremated, and, his, ashes, scattered, in, the, pacific, ocean, no, funeral, was, conducted, for, him, following, his, request, which, roderick, mann, remarked, was, appropriate, for, the, private, man, who, didn, t, want, the, nonsense, of, a, funeral, his, estate, was, worth, in, the, region, of, 60, to, 80, million, dollars, the, bulk, of, it, went, to, barbara, harris, and, jennifer, mccann, wrote, that, one, of, the, reasons, why, grant, s, film, career, was, so, successful, is, that, he, was, not, conscious, of, how, handsome, he, was, on, screen, acting, in, a, fashion, that, was, most, unexpected, and, unusual, from, a, hollywood, star, of, that, period, george, cukor, once, stated, you, see, he, didn, t, depend, on, his, looks, he, wasn, t, a, narcissist, he, acted, as, though, he, were, just, an, ordinary, young, man, and, that, made, it, all, the, more, appealing, that, a, handsome, young, man, was, funny, that, was, especially, unexpected, and, good, because, we, think, well, if, he, s, a, beau, brummel, he, can, t, be, either, funny, or, intelligent, but, he, proved, otherwise, jennifer, grant, acknowledged, that, her, father, neither, relied, on, his, looks, nor, was, a, character, actor, and, said, that, he, was, just, the, opposite, of, that, playing, the, basic, man, grant, s, appeal, was, unusually, broad, among, both, men, and, women, pauline, kael, remarked, that, men, wanted, to, be, him, and, women, dreamed, of, dating, him, she, noticed, that, grant, treated, his, female, co, stars, differently, than, many, of, the, leading, men, at, the, time, regarding, them, as, subjects, with, multiple, qualities, rather, than, treating, them, as, sex, objects, leslie, caron, said, that, he, was, the, most, talented, leading, man, she, worked, with, david, shipman, writes, that, more, than, most, stars, he, belonged, to, the, public, a, number, of, critics, have, argued, that, grant, had, the, rare, star, ability, to, turn, a, mediocre, picture, into, a, good, one, philip, t, hartung, of, the, commonweal, stated, in, his, review, for, mr, lucky, 1943, that, if, it, weren, t, for, cary, grant, s, persuasive, personality, the, whole, thing, would, melt, away, to, nothing, at, all, political, theorist, c, l, r, james, saw, grant, as, a, new, and, very, important, symbol, a, new, type, of, englishman, who, differed, from, leslie, howard, and, ronald, colman, who, represented, the, freedom, natural, grace, simplicity, and, directness, which, characterise, such, different, american, types, as, jimmy, stewart, and, ronald, reagan, which, ultimately, symbolized, the, growing, relationship, between, britain, and, america, once, he, realized, that, each, movement, could, be, stylized, for, humor, the, eyepopping, the, cocked, head, the, forward, lunge, and, the, slightly, ungainly, stride, became, as, certain, as, the, pen, strokes, of, a, master, cartoonist, film, critic, pauline, kael, on, the, development, of, grant, s, comic, acting, in, the, late, 1930s, mccann, notes, that, grant, typically, played, wealthy, privileged, characters, who, never, seemed, to, have, any, need, to, work, in, order, to, maintain, their, glamorous, and, hedonistic, lifestyle, martin, stirling, thought, that, grant, had, an, acting, range, that, was, greater, than, any, of, his, contemporaries, but, felt, that, a, number, of, critics, underrated, him, as, an, actor, he, believes, that, grant, was, always, at, his, physical, and, verbal, best, in, situations, that, bordered, on, farce, charles, champlin, identifies, a, paradox, in, grant, s, screen, persona, in, his, unusual, ability, to, mix, polish, and, pratfalls, in, successive, scenes, he, remarks, that, grant, was, refreshingly, able, to, play, the, near, fool, the, fey, idiot, without, compromising, his, masculinity, or, surrendering, to, camp, for, its, own, sake, wansell, further, notes, that, grant, could, with, the, arch, of, an, eyebrow, or, the, merest, hint, of, a, smile, question, his, own, image, stanley, donen, stated, that, his, real, magic, came, from, his, attention, to, minute, details, and, always, seeming, real, which, came, from, enormous, amounts, of, work, rather, than, being, god, given, grant, remarked, of, his, career, i, guess, to, a, certain, extent, i, did, eventually, become, the, characters, i, was, playing, i, played, at, being, someone, i, wanted, to, be, until, i, became, that, person, or, he, became, me, he, professed, that, the, real, cary, grant, was, more, like, his, scruffy, unshaven, fisherman, in, father, goose, than, the, well, tailored, charmer, of, charade, grant, often, poked, fun, at, himself, with, statements, such, as, everyone, wants, to, be, cary, grant, even, i, want, to, be, cary, grant, and, in, ad, lib, lines, such, as, in, his, girl, friday, 1940, listen, the, last, man, who, said, that, to, me, was, archie, leach, just, a, week, before, he, cut, his, throat, in, arsenic, and, old, lace, 1944, a, gravestone, is, seen, bearing, the, name, archie, leach, alfred, hitchcock, thought, that, grant, was, very, effective, in, darker, roles, with, a, mysterious, dangerous, quality, remarking, that, there, is, a, frightening, side,
