independent, but, central, italy, was, still, ruled, by, the, pope, in, this, era, pope, pius, ix, while, lombardy, venice, and, much, of, the, north, was, ruled, by, austria, other, states, were, de,

against, the, austrians, when, he, was, young, and, his, sympathy, was, with, them, but, the, empress, most, of, his, government, and, the, catholic, church, in, france, supported, the, pope, and, the, existing, governments, the, british, government, was, also, hostile, to, the, idea, of, promoting, nationalism, in, italy, despite, the, opposition, within, his, government, and, in, his, own, palace, napoleon, iii, did, all, that, he, could, to, support, the, cause, of, piedmont, sardinia, the, king, of, piedmont, sardinia, victor, emmanuel, ii, was, invited, to, paris, in, november, 1855, and, given, the, same, royal, treatment, as, queen, victoria, count, cavour, the, prime, minister, of, piedmont, sardinia, came, to, paris, with, the, king, and, employed, an, unusual, emissary, in, his, efforts, to, win, the, support, of, napoleon, iii, his, young, cousin, virginia, oldoini, countess, of, castiglione, 1837, 1899, as, cavour, had, hoped, she, caught, the, emperor, s, eye, and, became, his, mistress, between, 1855, and, 1857, she, used, the, opportunity, to, pass, messages, and, to, plead, the, italian, cause, in, july, 1858, napoleon, arranged, a, secret, visit, by, count, cavour, in, the, plombi, res, agreement, they, agreed, to, join, forces, and, drive, the, austrians, from, italy, in, exchange, napoleon, iii, asked, for, savoy, the, ancestral, land, of, the, king, of, piedmont, sardinia, and, the, then, bilingual, county, of, nice, which, had, been, taken, from, france, after, napoleon, s, fall, in, 1815, and, returned, to, piedmont, sardinia, cavour, protested, that, nice, was, italian, but, napoleon, responded, that, these, are, secondary, questions, there, will, be, time, later, to, discuss, them, assured, of, the, support, of, napoleon, iii, count, cavour, began, to, prepare, the, royal, sardinian, army, for, war, against, austria, napoleon, iii, looked, for, diplomatic, support, he, approached, lord, derby, the, prime, minister, of, the, united, kingdom, and, his, government, britain, was, against, the, war, but, agreed, to, remain, neutral, still, facing, strong, opposition, within, his, own, government, napoleon, iii, offered, to, negotiate, a, diplomatic, solution, with, the, twenty, eight, year, old, emperor, franz, joseph, i, of, austria, in, the, spring, of, 1858, the, austrians, demanded, the, disarmament, of, piedmont, sardinia, first, and, sent, thirty, thousand, soldiers, to, reinforce, their, garrisons, in, italy, napoleon, iii, responded, on, 26, january, 1859, by, signing, a, treaty, of, alliance, with, piedmont, sardinia, napoleon, promised, to, send, two, hundred, thousand, soldiers, to, help, one, hundred, thousand, soldiers, from, piedmont, sardinia, to, force, the, austrians, out, of, northern, italy, in, return, france, would, receive, the, county, of, nice, and, savoy, provided, that, their, populations, would, agree, in, a, referendum, it, was, the, emperor, franz, joseph, growing, impatient, who, finally, unleashed, the, war, on, 23, april, 1859, he, sent, an, ultimatum, to, the, government, of, piedmont, sardinia, demanding, that, they, stop, their, military, preparations, and, disband, their, army, on, 26, april, count, cavour, rejected, the, demands, and, on, 27, april, the, austrian, army, invaded, piedmont, napoleon, iii, though, he, had, very, little, military, experience, decided, to, lead, the, french, army, in, italy, himself, part, of, the, french, army, crossed, over, the, alps, while, the, other, part, with, the, emperor, landed, in, genoa, on, 18, may, 1859, fortunately, for, napoleon, and, the, piedmontese, the, commander, of, the, austrians, general, ferenc, gyulay, was, not, very, aggressive, his, forces, greatly, outnumbered, the, piedmontese, army, at, turin, but, he, hesitated, allowing, the, french, and, piedmontese, to, unite, their, forces, napoleon, iii, wisely, left, the, fighting, to, his, professional, generals, the, first, great, battle, of, the, war, on, 4, june, 1859, was, fought, at, the, town, of, magenta, it, was, long, and, bloody, and, the, french, center, was, exhausted, and, nearly, broken, but, the, battle, was, finally, won, by, a, timely, attack, on, the, austrian, flank, by, the, soldiers, of, general, patrice, de, macmahon, the, austrians, had, seven, thousand, men, killed, and, five, thousand, captured, while, the, french, forces, had, four, thousand, men, killed, the, battle, was, largely, remembered, because, soon, after, it, was, fought, patriotic, chemists, in, france, gave, the, name, of, the, battle, to, their, newly, discovered, bright, purple, chemical, dye, the, dye, and, the, colour, took, the, name, magenta, the, rest, of, the, austrian, army, was, able, to, escape, while, napoleon, iii, and, king, victor, emmanuel, made, a, triumphal, entry, on, 10, june, into, the, city, of, milan, previously, ruled, by, the, austrians, they, were, greeted, by, huge, jubilant, crowds, waving, italian, and, french, flags, the, austrians, had, been, driven, from, lombardy, but, the, army, of, general, gyulay, remained, in, the, veneto, his, army, had, been, reinforced, and, numbered, 130, 000, men, roughly, the, same, as, the, french, and, piedmontese, though, the, austrians, were, superior, in, artillery, on, 24, june, the, second, and, decisive, battle, was, fought, at, solferino, this, battle, was, even, longer, and, bloodier, than, magenta, in, confused, and, often, ill, directed, fighting, there, were, approximately, forty, thousand, casualties, including, 11, 500, french, napoleon, iii, was, horrified, by, the, thousands, of, dead, and, wounded, on, the, battlefield, he, proposed, an, armistice, to, the, austrians, which, was, accepted, on, 8, july, a, formal, treaty, ending, the, war, was, signed, on, 11, july, 1859, count, cavour, and, the, piedmontese, were, bitterly, disappointed, by, the, abrupt, end, of, the, war, lombardy, had, been, freed, but, venetia, the, venice, region, was, still, controlled, by, the, austrians, and, the, pope, was, still, the, ruler, of, rome, and, central, italy, cavour, angrily, resigned, his, post, napoleon, iii, returned, to, paris, on, 17, july, and, a, huge, parade, and, celebration, were, held, on, 14, august, in, front, of, the, vend, me, column, the, symbol, of, the, glory, of, napoleon, i, napoleon, iii, celebrated, the, day, by, granting, a, general, amnesty, to, the, political, prisoners, and, exiles, he, had, chased, from, france, in, italy, even, without, the, french, army, the, process, of, italian, unification, launched, by, cavour, and, napoleon, iii, took, on, a, momentum, of, its, own, there, were, uprisings, in, central, italy, and, the, papal, states, and, italian, patriots, led, by, garibaldi, invaded, and, took, over, sicily, which, would, lead, to, the, collapse, of, the, kingdom, of, the, two, sicilies, napoleon, iii, wrote, to, the, pope, and, suggested, that, he, make, the, sacrifice, of, your, provinces, in, revolt, and, confide, them, to, victor, emmanuel, the, pope, furious, declared, in, a, public, address, that, napoleon, iii, was, a, liar, and, a, cheat, rome, and, the, surrounding, latium, region, remained, in, papal, hands, and, therefore, did, not, immediately, become, the, capital, of, the, newly, created, kingdom, of, italy, and, venetia, was, still, occupied, by, the, austrians, but, the, rest, of, italy, had, come, under, the, rule, of, victor, emmanuel, as, cavour, had, promised, savoy, and, the,

ix, over, who, would, govern, rome, made, him, unpopular, with, fervent, french, catholics, and, even, with, empress, eug, nie, who, was, a, fervent, catholic, to, win, over, the, french, catholics, and, his, wife, he, agreed, to, guarantee, that, rome, would, remain, under, the, pope, and, independent, from, the, rest, of, italy, and, agreed, to, keep, french, troops, there, the, capital, of, italy, became, turin, in, 1861, then, florence, in, 1865, not, rome, however, in, 1862, garibaldi, gathered, an, army, to, march, on, rome, under, the, slogan, rome, or, death, to, avoid, a, confrontation, between, garibaldi, and, the, french, soldiers, the, italian, government, sent, its, own, soldiers, to, face, them, arrested, garibaldi, and, put, him, in, prison, napoleon, iii, sought, a, diplomatic, solution, that, would, allow, him, to, withdraw, french, troops, from, rome, while, guaranteeing, that, the, city, would, remain, under, papal, control, in, the, 1864, september, convention, the, italian, government, guaranteed, the, independence, of, the, rump, papal, states, and, the, french, garrison, in, rome, was, withdrawn, however, garibaldi, made, another,

and, their, advice, and, attributed, any, problems, simply, to, rheumatism, for, which, he, regularly, visited, the, hot, springs, at, vichy, and, other, spas, it, became, difficult, for, him, to, ride, a, horse, and, he, was, obliged, to, walk, slowly, often, with, a, cane, from, 1869, onwards, the, crises, of, his, urinary, tract, were, treated, with, opium, which, made, him, seem, lethargic,

contrary, to, the, truth, alarms, about, the, health, of, the, emperor, at, the, end, of, june, 1870, a, specialist, in, the, problems, of, urinary, tracts, germain, s, e, was, finally, summoned, to, examine, him, s, e, reported, that, the, emperor, was, suffering, from, a, gallstone, on, 2, july, four, eminent, french, doctors, auguste, n, laton, philippe, ricord, fauvel, and, corvisart, examined, him, and, confirmed, the, diagnosis, they, were, reluctant, to, operate, however, because, of, the, high, risk, gallstone, operations, did, not, become, relatively, safe, until, the, 1880s, and, because, of, the, emperor, s, weakness, before, anything, further, could, be, done, however, france, was, in, the, middle, of, a, diplomatic, crisis, in, the, 1860s, prussia, appeared, on, the, horizon, as, a, new, rival, to, french, power, in, europe, its, minister, president, otto, von, bismarck, had, ambitions, for, prussia, to, lead, a, unified, germany, in, may, 1862, bismarck, came, to, paris, on, a, diplomatic, mission, and, met, napoleon, iii, for, the, first, time, they, had, cordial, relations, on, 30, september, 1862, however, in, munich, bismarck, declared, in, a, famous, speech, it, is, not, by, speeches, and, votes, of, the, majority, that, the, great, questions, of, our, period, will, be, settled, as, one, believed, in, 1848, but, by, iron, and, blood, bismarck, saw, austria, and, france, as, the, main, obstacles, to, his, ambitions, and, he, set, out, to, divide, and, defeat, them, in, the, winter, and, spring, of, 1864, when, the, german, confederation, invaded, and, occupied, the, german, speaking, duchies, ruled, by, denmark, schleswig, and, holstein, napoleon, iii, recognized, the, threat, that, a, unified, germany, would, pose, to, france, and, he, looked, for, allies, to, challenge, germany, without, success, the, british, government, was, suspicious, that, napoleon, wanted, to, take, over, belgium, and, luxembourg, felt, secure, with, its, powerful, navy, and, did, not, want, any, military, engagements, on, the, european, continent, at, the, side, of, the, french, the, russian, government, was, also, suspicious, of, napoleon, who, it, believed, had, encouraged, polish, nationalists, to, rebel, against, russian, rule, in, 1863, bismarck, and, prussia, on, the, other, hand, had, offered, assistance, to, russia, to, help, crush, the, polish, patriots, in, october, 1865, napoleon, had, a, cordial, meeting, with, bismarck, at, biarritz, they, discussed, venetia, austria, s, remaining, province, in, italy, bismarck, told, napoleon, that, prussia, had, no, secret, arrangement, to, give, venetia, to, italy, and, napoleon, assured, him, in, turn, that, france, had, no, secret, understanding, with, austria, bismarck, hinted, vaguely, that, in, the, event, of, a, war, between, austria, and, prussia, french, neutrality, would, be, rewarded, with, some, sort, of, territory, as, a, compensation, napoleon, iii, had, luxembourg, in, mind, in, 1866, relations, between, austria, and, prussia, worsened, and, bismarck, demanded, the, expulsion, of, austria, from, the, german, confederation, napoleon, and, his, foreign, minister, drouyn, de, lhuys, expected, a, long, war, and, an, eventual, austrian, victory, napoleon, iii, felt, he, could, extract, a, price, from, both, prussia, and, austria, for, french, neutrality, on, 12, june, 1866, france, signed, a, secret, treaty, with, austria, guaranteeing, french, neutrality, in, a, prussian, austrian, war, in, exchange, in, the, event, of, an, austrian, victory, austria, would, give, venetia, to, france, and, would, also, create, a, new, independent, german, state, on, the, rhine, which, would, become, an, ally, of, france, at, the, same, time, napoleon, proposed, a, secret, treaty, with, bismarck, promising, that, france, would, remain, neutral, in, a, war, between, austria, and, prussia, in, the, event, of, a, prussian, victory, france, would, recognize, prussia, s, annexation, of, smaller, german, states, and, france, in, exchange, would, receive, a, portion, of, german, territory, the, palatinate, region, north, of, alsace, bismarck, rightly, confident, of, success, due, to, the, modernization, of, the, prussian, army, summarily, rejected, napoleon, s, offer, on, 15, june, the, prussian, army, invaded, saxony, an, ally, of, austria, on, 2, july, austria, asked, napoleon, to, arrange, an, armistice, between, italy, which, had, allied, itself, with, prussia, and, austria, in, exchange, for, which, france, would, receive, venetia, but, on, 3, july, the, prussian, army, crushed, the, austrian, army, at, the, battle, of, k, niggr, tz, in, bohemia, the, way, to, vienna, was, open, for, the, prussians, and, austria, asked, for, an, armistice, the, armistice, was, signed, on, 22, july, prussia, annexed, the, kingdom, of, hanover, the, electorate, of, hesse, the, duchy, of, nassau, and, the, free, city, of, frankfurt, with, a, combined, population, of, four, million, people, the, austrian, defeat, was, followed, by, a, new, crisis, in, the, health, of, napoleon, iii, marshal, canrobert, who, saw, him, on, 28, july, wrote, that, the, emperor, was, pitiful, to, see, he, could, barely, sit, up, in, his, armchair, and, his, drawn, face, expressed, at, the, same, time, moral, anguish, and, physical, pain, napoleon, iii, still, hoped, to, receive, some, compensation, from, prussia, for, french, neutrality, during, the, war, his, foreign, minister, drouyn, asked, bismarck, for, the, palatinate, region, on, the, rhine, which, belonged, to, bavaria, and, for, the, demilitarization, of, luxembourg, which, was, the, site, of, a, formidable, fortress, staffed, by, a, strong, prussian, garrison, in, accordance, with, international, treaties, napoleon, s, senior, advisor, eug, ne, rouher, increased, the, demands, asking, that, prussia, accept, the, annexation, by, france, of, belgium, and, of, luxembourg, sparking, the, luxembourg, crisis, luxembourg, had, regained, its, de, jure, independence, in, 1839, as, a, grand, duchy, however, it, was, in, personal, union, with, the, netherlands, king, william, iii, of, the, netherlands, who, was, also, grand, duke, of, luxembourg, desperately, needed, money, and, was, prepared, to, sell, the, grand, duchy, to, france, bismarck, swiftly, intervened, and, showed, the, british, ambassador, a, copy, of, napoleon, s, demands, as, a, result, he, put, pressure, on, william, iii, to, refuse, to, sell, luxembourg, to, france, france, was, forced, to, renounce, any, claim, to, luxembourg, in, the, treaty, of, london, 1867, napoleon, iii, gained, nothing, for, his, efforts, but, the, demilitarization, of, the, luxembourg, fortress, despite, his, failing, health, napoleon, iii, could, see, that, the, prussian, army, combined, with, the, armies, of, bavaria, and, the, other, german, states, would, be, a, formidable, enemy, in, 1866, prussia, with, a, population, of, 22, million, had, been, able, to, mobilize, an, army, of, 700, 000, men, while, france, with, a, population, of, 38, million, had, an, army, of, only, 385, 000, men, of, whom, 140, 000, were, in, algeria, mexico, and, rome, in, the, autumn, of, 1867, napoleon, iii, proposed, a, form, of, universal, military, service, similar, to, the, prussian, system, to, increase, the, size, of, the, french, army, if, needed, to, 1, million, his, proposal, was, opposed, by, many, french, officers, such, as, marshal, randon, who, preferred, a, smaller, more, professional, army, he, said, this, proposal, will, only, give, us, recruits, it, s, soldiers, we, need, it, was, also, strongly, opposed, by, the, republican, opposition, in, the, french, parliament, who, denounced, the, proposal, as, a, militarization, of, french, society, the, republican, deputy, mile, ollivier, who, later, became, napoleon, s, prime, minister, declared, the, armies, of, france, which, i, always, considered, too, large, are, now, going, to, be, increased, to, an, exorbitant, size, why, what, is, the, necessity, where, is, the, danger, who, is, threatening, us, if, france, were, to, disarm, the, germans, would, know, how, to, convince, their, governments, to, do, the, same, facing, almost, certain, defeat, in, the, parliament, napoleon, iii, withdrew, the, proposal, it, was, replaced, in, january, 1868, by, a, much, more, modest, project, to, create, a, garde, mobile, or, reserve, force, to, support, the, army, napoleon, iii, was, overconfident, in, his, military, strength, and, went, into, war, even, after, he, failed, to, find, any, allies, who, would, support, a, war, to, stop, german, unification, following, the, defeat, of, austria, napoleon, resumed, his, search, for, allies, against, prussia, in, april, 1867, he, proposed, an, alliance, defensive, and, offensive, with, austria, if, austria, joined, france, in, a, victorious, war, against, prussia, napoleon, promised, that, austria, could, form, a, new, confederation, with, the, southern, states, of, germany, and, could, annex, silesia, while, france, took, for, its, part, the, left, bank, of, the, rhine, river, but, the, timing, of, napoleon, s, offer, was, poorly, chosen, austria, was, in, the, process, of, a, major, internal, reform, creating, the, new, dual, monarchy, of, austria, hungary, napoleon, s, attempt, to, install, the, archduke, maximilian, the, brother, of, the, austrian, emperor, in, mexico, was, just, coming, to, its, disastrous, conclusion, the, french, troops, had, just, been, withdrawn, from, mexico, in, february, 1867, and, the, unfortunate, maximilian, would, be, captured, judged, and, shot, by, a, firing, squad, on, 19, june, napoleon, iii, made, these, offers, again, in, august, 1867, on, a, visit, to, offer, condolences, for, the, death, of, maximilian, but, the, proposal, was, not, received, with, enthusiasm, napoleon, iii, also, made, one, last, attempt, to, persuade, italy, to, be, his, ally, against, prussia, italian, king, victor, emmanuel, was, personally, favorable, to, a, better, relationship, with, france, remembering, the, role, that, napoleon, iii, had, played, in, achieving, italian, unification, but, italian, public, opinion, was, largely, hostile, to, france, on, 3, november, 1867, french, and, papal, soldiers, had, fired, upon, the, italian, patriots, of, garibaldi, when, he, tried, to, capture, rome, napoleon, presented, a, proposed, treaty, of, alliance, on, 4, june, 1869, the, anniversary, of, the, joint, french, italian, victory, at, magenta, the, italians, responded, by, demanding, that, france, withdraw, its, troops, who, were, protecting, the, pope, in, rome, given, the, opinion, of, fervent, french, catholics, this, was, a, condition, napoleon, iii, could, not, accept, while, napoleon, iii, was, having, no, success, finding, allies, bismarck, signed, secret, military, treaties, with, the, southern, german, states, who, promised, to, provide, troops, in, the, event, of, a, war, between, prussia, and, france, in, 1868, bismarck, signed, an, accord, with, russia, that, gave, russia, liberty, of, action, in, the, balkans, in, exchange, for, neutrality, in, the, event, of, a, war, between, france, and, prussia, this, treaty, put, additional, pressure, on, austria, hungary, which, also, had, interests, in, the, balkans, not, to, ally, itself, with, france, but, most, importantly, prussia, promised, to, support, russia, in, lifting, the, restrictions, of, the, congress, of, paris, bismarck, had, bought, tsar, alexander, ii, s, complicity, by, promising, to, help, restore, his, naval, access, to, the, black, sea, and, mediterranean, cut, off, by, the, treaties, ending, the, crimean, war, other, powers, were, less, biddable, bismarck, also, reached, out, to, the, liberal, government, of, william, gladstone, in, london, offering, to, protect, the, neutrality, of, belgium, against, a, french, threat, the, british, foreign, office, under, lord, clarendon, mobilized, the, british, fleet, to, dissuade, france, against, any, aggressive, moves, against, belgium, in, any, war, between, france, and, prussia, france, would, be, entirely, alone, in, 1867, french, politician, adolphe, thiers, who, became, president, of, the, french, republic, in, 1871, accused, napoleon, iii, of, erroneous, foreign, policy, there, is, no, mistake, that, can, be, made, bismarck, thought, that, french, vanity, would, lead, to, war, he, exploited, that, vanity, in, the, ems, dispatch, in, july, 1870, france, took, the, bait, and, declared, war, on, prussia, which, proved, to, be, a, major, miscalculation, this, allowed, bismarck, and, prussia, to, present, the, war, to, the, world, as, defensive, although, prussia, and, bismarck, had, aggressive, plans, and, they, soon, became, known, in, relation, to, the, annexation, of, the, french, provinces, of, alsace, lorraine, in, his, memoirs, written, long, after, the, war, bismarck, wrote, i, always, considered, that, a, war, with, france, would, naturally, follow, a, war, against, austria, i, was, convinced, that, the, gulf, which, was, created, over, time, between, the, north, and, the, south, of, germany, could, not, be, better, overcome, than, by, a, national, war, against, the, neighbouring, people, who, were, aggressive, against, us, i, did, not, doubt, that, it, was, necessary, to, make, a, french, german, war, before, the, general, reorganization, of, germany, could, be, realized, as, the, summer, of, 1870, approached, pressure, mounted, on, bismarck, to, have, a, war, with, france, as, quickly, as, possible, in, bavaria, the, largest, of, the, southern, german, states, unification, with, mostly, protestant, prussia, was, being, opposed, by, the, patriotic, party, which, favoured, a, confederacy, of, catholic, bavaria, with, catholic, austria, german, protestant, public, opinion, was, on, the, side, of, unification, with, prussia, in, france, patriotic, sentiment, was, also, growing, on, 8, may, 1870, french, voters, had, overwhelmingly, supported, napoleon, iii, s, program, in, a, national, plebiscite, with, 7, 358, 000, votes, yes, against, 1, 582, 000, votes, no, an, increase, of, support, of, two, million, votes, since, the, legislative, elections, in, 1869, the, emperor, was, less, popular, in, paris, and, the, big, cities, but, highly, popular, in, the, french, countryside, napoleon, had, named, a, new, foreign, minister, antoine, agenor, the, duke, de, gramont, who, was, hostile, to, bismarck, the, emperor, was, weak, and, ill, but, the, more, extreme, bonapartists, were, prepared, to, show, their, strength, against, the, republicans, and, monarchists, in, the, parliament, the, news, of, leopold, prince, of, hohenzollern, s, candidacy, for, the, spanish, crown, published, 2, july, 1870, aroused, fury, in, the, french, parliament, and, press, the, government, was, attacked, by, both, the, republicans, and, monarchist, opposition, and, by, the, ultra, bonapartists, for, its, weakness, against, prussia, on, 6, july, napoleon, iii, held, a, meeting, of, his, ministers, at, the, ch, teau, of, saint, cloud, and, told, them, that, prussia, must, withdraw, the, hohenzollern, candidacy, or, there, would, be, a, war, he, asked, marshal, leboeuf, the, chief, of, staff, of, the, french, army, if, the, army, was, prepared, for, a, war, against, prussia, leboeuf, responded, that, the, french, soldiers, had, a, rifle, superior, to, the, prussian, rifle, that, the, french, artillery, was, commanded, by, an, elite, corps, of, officers, and, that, the, army, would, not, lack, a, button, on, its, puttees, he, assured, the, emperor, that, the, french, army, could, have, four, hundred, thousand, men, on, the, rhine, in, less, than, fifteen, days, the, french, ambassador, to, prussia, count, vincent, benedetti, was, sent, to, the, german, spa, resort, of, bad, ems, where, the, prussian, king, was, staying, benedetti, met, with, the, king, on, 13, july, in, the, park, of, the, ch, teau, the, king, told, him, courteously, that, he, agreed, fully, with, the, withdrawal, of, the, hohenzollern, candidacy, but, that, he, could, not, make, promises, on, behalf, of, the, government, for, the, future, he, considered, that, the, matter, was, closed, as, he, was, instructed, by, gramont, benedetti, asked, for, another, meeting, with, the, king, to, repeat, the, request, but, the, king, politely, yet, firmly, refused, benedetti, returned, to, paris, and, the, affair, seemed, finished, however, bismarck, edited, the, official, dispatch, of, the, meeting, to, make, it, appear, that, both, sides, had, been, hostile, his, majesty, the, king, the, dispatch, read, refused, to, meet, again, with, the, french, ambassador, and, let, him, know, through, an, aide, de, camp, of, service, that, his, majesty, had, nothing, more, to, say, to, the, ambassador, this, version, was, communicated, to, governments, and, the, next, day, was, in, the, french, press, the, ems, telegram, had, exactly, the, effect, that, bismarck, had, intended, once, again, public, opinion, in, france, was, inflamed, this, text, produced, the, effect, of, a, red, flag, to, the, gallic, bull, bismarck, later, wrote, gramont, the, french, foreign, minister, declared, that, he, felt, he, had, just, received, a, slap, the, leader, of, the, conservatives, in, parliament, thiers, spoke, for, moderation, arguing, that, france, had, won, the, diplomatic, battle, and, there, was, no, reason, for, war, but, he, was, drowned, out, by, cries, that, he, was, a, traitor, and, a, prussian, napoleon, s, new, prime, minister, mile, ollivier, declared, that, france, had, done, all, that, it, could, humanly, and, honourably, do, to, prevent, the, war, and, that, he, accepted, the, responsibility, with, a, light, heart, a, crowd, of, 15, 000, 20, 000, persons, carrying, flags, and, patriotic, banners, marched, through, the, streets, of, paris, demanding, war, on, 19, july, 1870, a, declaration, of, war, was, sent, to, the, prussian, government, when, france, entered, the, war, there, were, patriotic, demonstrations, in, the, streets, of, paris, with, crowds, singing, la, marseillaise, and, chanting, to, berlin, to, berlin, but, napoleon, was, melancholic, he, told, general, lepic, that, he, expected, the, war, to, be, long, and, difficult, and, wondered, who, knows, if, we, ll, come, back, he, told, marshal, randon, that, he, felt, too, old, for, a, military, campaign, despite, his, declining, health, napoleon, decided, to, go, with, the, army, to, the, front, as, commander, in, chief, as, he, had, done, during, the, successful, italian, campaign, on, 28, july, he, departed, saint, cloud, by, train, for, the, front, he, was, accompanied, by, the, 14, year, old, prince, imperial, in, the, uniform, of, the, army, by, his, military, staff, and, by, a, large, contingent, of, chefs, and, servants, in, livery, he, was, pale, and, visibly, in, pain, the, empress, remained, in, paris, as, the, regent, as, she, had, done, on, other, occasions, when, the, emperor, was, out, of, the, country, the, mobilization, of, the, french, army, was, chaotic, two, hundred, thousand, soldiers, converged, on, the, german, frontier, along, a, front, of, 250, kilometers, choking, all, the, roads, and, railways, for, miles, officers, and, their, respective, units, were, unable, to, find, one, another, general, moltke, and, the, prussian, army, having, gained, experience, mobilizing, in, the, war, against, austria, were, able, to, efficiently, move, three, armies, of, 518, 000, men, to, a, more, concentrated, front, of, just, 120, kilometers, in, addition, the, german, soldiers, were, backed, by, a, substantial, reserve, of, the, landwehr, territorial, defence, with, 340, 000, men, and, an, additional, reserve, of, 400, 000, territorial, guards, the, french, army, arrived, at, the, frontier, equipped, with, maps, of, germany, but, without, maps, of, france, where, the, actual, fighting, took, place, and, without, a, specific, plan, of, what, it, was, going, to, do, on, 2, august, napoleon, and, the, prince, imperial, accompanied, the, army, as, it, made, a, tentative, crossing, of, the, german, border, toward, the, city, of, saarbr, cken, the, french, won, a, minor, skirmish, and, advanced, no, further, napoleon, iii, very, ill, was, unable, to, ride, his, horse, and, had, to, support, himself, by, leaning, against, a, tree, in, the, meantime, the, prussians, had, assembled, a, much, larger, army, opposite, alsace, and, lorraine, than, the, french, had, expected, or, were, aware, of, on, 4, august, 1870, the, prussians, attacked, with, overwhelming, force, against, a, french, division, in, alsace, at, the, battle, of, wissembourg, german,

french, cavalry, and, infantry, attacked, the, german, lines, repeatedly, but, the, germans, had, superior, logistics, communications, and, leadership, the, decisive, weapon, was, the, new, german, krupp, six, pound, field, gun, which, was, breech, loading, had, a, steel, barrel, longer, range, a, higher, rate, of, fire, and, was, more, accurate, than, the, bronze, muzzle, loading, french, cannons, the, krupp, guns, caused, terrible, casualties, in, the, french, ranks, when, news, of, the, french, defeats, reached, paris, on, 7, august, it, was, greeted, with, disbelief, and, dismay,

prime, minister, the, count, of, palikao, named, marshal, fran, ois, achille, bazaine, the, commander, of, the, french, forces, in, lorraine, as, the, new, military, commander, napoleon, iii, proposed, returning, to, paris, realizing, that, he, was, not, doing, any, good, for, the, army, the, empress, in, charge, of, the, government, responded, by, telegraph, don, t, think, of, coming, back, unless, you, want, to, unleash, a, terrible, revolution, they, will, say, you, quit, the, army, to, flee, the, danger, the, emperor, agreed, to, remain, with, the, army, with, the, empress, directing, the, country, and, bazaine, commanding, the, army, the, emperor, no, longer, had, any, real, role, to, play, at, the, front, the, emperor, told, marshal, leboeuf, we, ve, both, been,

suffered, 20, 000, casualties, and, the, french, 12, 000, but, the, germans, emerged, as, the, victors, as, marshal, bazaine, s, army, with, 175, 000, soldiers, six, divisions, of, cavalry, and, five, hundred, cannons, was, besieged, inside, the, fortifications, of, metz, unable, to, move, napoleon, was, at, ch, lons, sur, marne, with, the, army, of, marshal, patrice, de, macmahon, macmahon, marshal, bazaine, and, the, count, of, palikao, with, the, empress, in, paris, all, had, different, ideas, of, what, the, army, should, do, next, and, the, emperor, had, to, act, as, a, referee, the, emperor, and, macmahon, proposed, moving, their, army, closer, to, paris, to, protect, the, city, but, on, 17, august, bazaine, telegraphed, to, the, emperor, i, urge, you, to, renounce, this, idea, which, seems, to, abandon, the, army, at, metz, couldn, t, you, make, a, powerful, diversion, toward, the, prussian, corps, which, are, already, exhausted, by, so, many, battles, the, empress, shares, my, opinion, napoleon, iii, wrote, back, i, yield, to, your, opinion, the, emperor, sent, the, prince, imperial, back, to, paris, for, his, safety, and, went, with, the, weary, army, in, the, direction, of, metz, the, emperor, riding, in, an, open, carriage, was, jeered, sworn, at, and, insulted, by, demoralized, soldiers, the, direction, of, movement, of, macmahon, s, army, was, supposed, to, be, secret, but, it, was, published, in, the, french, press, and, thus, was, quickly, known, to, the, german, general, staff, moltke, the, german, commander, ordered, two, prussian, armies, marching, toward, paris, to, turn, towards, macmahon, s, army, on, 30, august, one, corps, of, macmahon, s, army, was, attacked, by, the, germans, at, beaumont, losing, five, hundred, men, and, forty, cannons, macmahon, believing, he, was, ahead, of, the, germans, decided, to, stop, and, reorganize, his, forces, at, the, fortified, city, of, sedan, in, the, ardennes, close, to, the, belgian, border, the, battle, of, sedan, was, a, total, disaster, for, the, french, the, army, surrendered, to, the, prussians, and, napoleon, himself, was, made, a, prisoner, of, war, macmahon, arrived, at, sedan, with, one, hundred, thousand, soldiers, not, knowing, that, two, german, armies, were, closing, in, on, the, city, one, from, the, west, and, one, from, the, east, blocking, any, escape, the, germans, arrived, on, 31, august, and, by, 1, september, occupied, the, heights, around, sedan, where, they, placed, artillery, batteries, and, began, shelling, the, french, positions, below, at, five, o, clock, in, the, morning, on, 1, september, a, german, shell, seriously, wounded, macmahon, in, the, hip, sedan, quickly, came, under, bombardment, from, seven, hundred, german, guns,

the, open, around, the, french, positions, one, officer, of, his, military, escort, was, killed, and, two, more, received, wounds, a, doctor, accompanying, him, wrote, in, his, notebook, if, this, man, has, not, come, here, to, kill, himself, i, don, t, know, what, he, has, come, to, do, i, have, not, seen, him, give, an, order, all, morning, finally, at, one, o, clock, in, the, afternoon, napoleon, emerged, from, his, reverie, and, ordered, a, white, flag, hoisted, above, the, citadel, he, then, had, a, message, sent, to, the, prussian, king, who, was, at, sedan, with, his, army, monsieur, my, brother, not, being, able, to, die, at, the, head, of, my, troops, nothing, remains, for, me, but, to, place, my, sword, in, the, hands, of, your, majesty, after, the, war, when, accused, of, having, made, a, shameful, surrender, at, sedan, he, wrote, some, people, believe, that, by, burying, ourselves, under, the, ruins, of, sedan, we, would, have, better, served, my, name, and, my, dynasty, it, s, possible, nay, to, hold, in, my, hand, the, lives, of, thousands, of, men, and, not, to, make, a, sign, to, save, them, was, something, that, was, beyond, my, capacity, my, heart, refused, these, sinister, grandeurs, at, six, o, clock, in, the, morning, on, 2, september, in, the, uniform, of, a, general, and, accompanied, by, four, generals, from, his, staff, napoleon,

dictated, the, terms, of, the, surrender, to, napoleon, napoleon, asked, that, his, army, be, disarmed, and, allowed, to, pass, into, belgium, but, bismarck, refused, they, also, asked, napoleon, to, sign, the, preliminary, documents, of, a, peace, treaty, but, napoleon, refused, telling, them, that, the, french, government, headed, by, the, regent, empress, eug, nie, would, need, to, negotiate, any, peace, agreement, the, emperor, was, then, taken, to, the, ch, teau, at, bellevue, near, fr, nois, ardennes, where, the, prussian, king, visited, him, napoleon, told, the, king, that, he, had, not, wanted, the, war, but, that, public, opinion, had, forced, him, into, it, that, evening, from, the, ch, teau, napoleon, wrote, to, the, empress, eug, nie, it, is, impossible, for, me, to, say, what, i, have, suffered, and, what, i, am, suffering, now, i, would, have, preferred, death, to, a, capitulation, so, disastrous, and, yet, under, the, present, circumstances, it, was, the, only, way, to, avoid, the, butchering, of, sixty, thousand, people, if, only, all, my, torments, were, concentrated, here, i, think, of, you, our, son, and, our, unhappy, country, the, news, of, the, capitulation, reached, paris, on, 3, september, confirming, the, rumors, that, were, already, circulating, in, the, city, when, the, empress, heard, the, news, that, the, emperor, and, the, army, had, been, taken, prisoner, she, reacted, by, shouting, at, the, emperor, s, personal, aide, no, an, emperor, does, not, capitulate, he, is, dead, they, are, trying, to, hide, it, from, me, why, didn, t, he, kill, himself, doesn, t, he, know, he, has, dishonored, himself, later, when, hostile, crowds, formed, near, the, palace, and, the, staff, began, to, flee, the, empress, slipped, out, with, one,

conservative, regime, in, france, for, himself, or, for, napoleon, s, son, bazaine, s, envoy, who, spoke, to, bismarck, at, versailles, on, 14, october, declared, that, the, army, in, metz, was, still, loyal, to, napoleon, bazaine, was, willing, to, take, over, power, in, france, after, the, germans, had, defeated, the, republic, in, paris, because, of, the, weakening, of, the, french, position, overall, bismarck, lost, interest, in, this, option, on, 27, november, napoleon, composed, a, memorandum, to, bismarck, that, raised, the, possibility, that, the, prussian, king, might, urge, the, french, people, to, recall, him, as, emperor, after, a, peace, treaty, was, signed, and, paris, surrendered, but, by, this, time, metz, had, already, fallen, leaving, napoleon, without, a, power, base, bismarck, did, not, see, much, chance, for, a, restored, empire, as, the, french, people, would, consider, napoleon, a, mere, marionette, of, the, enemy, one, last, initiative, from, eug, nie, failed, in, january, because, of, the, late, arrival, of, her, envoy, from, london, bismarck, refused, to, acknowledge, the, former, empress, as, this, had, caused, irritations, with, britain,

napoleon, iii, by, saying, hegel, remarks, somewhere, that, all, great, world, historical, facts, and, personages, appear, so, to, speak, twice, he, forgot, to, add, the, first, time, as, tragedy, the, second, time, as, farce, napoleon, iii, has, often, been, seen, as, an, authoritarian, but, ineffectual, leader, who, brought, france, into, dubious, and, ultimately, disastrous, foreign, military, adventures, historians, by, the, 1930s, saw, the, second, empire, as, a, precursor, of, fascism, but, by, the, 1950s, were, celebrating, it, as, leading, example, of, a, modernizing, regime, however, historians, have, generally, given, napoleon, negative, evaluations, on, his, foreign, policy, and, somewhat, more, positive, evaluations, of, his, domestic, policies, especially, after, he, liberalized, his, rule, after, 1858, his, greatest, achievements, came, in, material, improvements, in, the, form, of, a, grand, railway, network, that, facilitated, commerce, and, tied, the, nation, together, and, centered, it, on, paris, he, is, given, high, credits, for, the, rebuilding, of, paris, with, broad, boulevards, striking, public, buildings, very, attractive, residential, districts,
