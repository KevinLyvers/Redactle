protestant, principle, of, the, popular, election, of, a, pastor, he, proposed, knox, to, the, congregation, for, that, office, knox, did, not, relish, the, idea, according, to, his, own, account, he, burst, into, tears, and, fled, to, his, room, within, a, week, however, he, was, giving, his, first, sermon, to, a, congregation, that, included, his, old, teacher, john, major, he, expounded, on, the, seventh, chapter, of, the, book, of, daniel, comparing, the, pope, with, the, antichrist, his, sermon, was, marked, by, his, consideration, of, the, bible, as, his, sole, authority, and, the, doctrine, of, justification, by, faith, alone, two, elements, that, would, remain, in, his, thoughts, throughout, the, rest, of, his, life, a, few, days, later, a, debate, was, staged, that, allowed, him, to, lay, down, additional, theses, including, the, rejection, of, the, mass, purgatory, and, prayers, for, the, dead, john, knox, s, chaplaincy, of, the, castle, garrison, was, not, to, last, long, while, hamilton, was, willing, to, negotiate, with, england, to, stop, their, support, of, the, rebels, and, bring, the, castle, back, under, his, control, mary, of, guise, decided, that, it, could, be, taken, only, by, force, and, requested, the, king, of, france, henry, ii, to, intervene, on, 29, june, 1547, 21, french, galleys, approached, st, andrews, under, the, command, of, leone,

prisoner, and, forced, to, row, in, the, french, galleys, the, galley, slaves, were, chained, to, benches, and, rowed, throughout, the, day, without, a, change, of, posture, while, an, officer, watched, over, them, with, a, whip, in, hand, they, sailed, to, france, and, navigated, up, the, seine, to, rouen, the, nobles, some, of, whom, would, have, a, bearing, on, knox, s, later, life, such, as, william, kirkcaldy, and, henry, balnaves, were, sent, to, various, castle, prisons, in, france, knox, and, the, other, galley, slaves, continued, to, nantes, and, stayed, on, the, loire, throughout, the, winter, they, were, threatened, with, torture, if, they, did, not, give, proper, signs, of, reverence, when, mass, was, performed, on, the, ship, knox, recounted, an, incident, in, which, one, of, the, prisoners, possibly, himself, as, knox, tended, to, narrate, personal, anecdotes, in, the, third, person, was, required, to, show, devotion, to, a, picture, of, the, virgin, mary, the, prisoner, was, told, to, give, it, a, kiss, of, veneration, he, refused, and, when, the, picture, was, pushed, up, to, his, face, the, prisoner, seized, the, picture, and, threw, it, into, the, sea, saying, let, our, lady, now, save, herself, she, is, light, enough, let, her, learn, to, swim, after, that, according, to, knox, the, scottish, prisoners, were, no, longer, forced, to, perform, such, devotions, in, summer, 1548, the, galleys, returned, to, scotland, to, scout, for, english, ships, knox, s, health, was, now, at, its, lowest, point, due, to, the, severity, of, his, confinement, he, was, ill, with, a, fever, and, others, on, the, ship, were, afraid, for, his, life, even, in, this, state, knox, recalled, his, mind, remained, sharp, and, he, comforted, his, fellow, prisoners, with, hopes, of, release, while, the, ships, were, lying, offshore, between, st, andrews, and, dundee, the, spires, of, the, parish, church, where, he, preached, appeared, in, view, james, balfour, a, fellow, prisoner, asked, knox, whether, he, recognised, the, landmark, he, replied, that, he, knew, it, well, recognising, the, steeple, of, the, place, where, he, first, preached, and, he, declared, that, he, would, not, die, until, he, had, preached, there, again, in, february, 1549, after, spending, a, total, of, 19, months, in, the, galley, prison, knox, was, released, it, is, uncertain, how, he, obtained, his, liberty, later, in, the, year, henry, ii, arranged, with, edward, vi, of, england, the, release, of, all, remaining, castilian, prisoners, on, his, release, knox, took, refuge, in, england, the, reformation, in, england, was, a, less, radical, movement, than, its, continental, counterparts, but, there, was, a, definite, breach, with, rome, the, archbishop, of, canterbury, thomas, cranmer, and, the, regent, of, king, edward, vi, the, duke, of, somerset, were, decidedly, protestant, minded, however, much, work, remained, to, bring, reformed, ideas, to, the,

recently, released, 1549, book, of, common, prayer, which, maintained, the, structure, of, the, sarum, rite, while, adapting, the, content, to, the, doctrine, of, the, reformed, church, of, england, knox, however, modified, its, use, to, accord, with, the, doctrinal, emphases, of, the, continental, reformers, in, the, pulpit, he, preached, protestant, doctrines, with, great, effect, as, his, congregation, grew, in, england, knox, met, his, wife, margery, bowes, died, c, 1560, her, father, richard, bowes, died, 1558, was, a, descendant, of, an, old, durham, family, and, her, mother, elizabeth, aske, was, an, heiress, of, a, yorkshire, family, the, askes, of, richmondshire, elizabeth, presumably, met, knox, when, he, was, employed, in, berwick, several, letters, reveal, a, close, friendship, between, them, it, is, not, recorded, when, knox, married, margery, bowes, knox, attempted, to, obtain, the, consent, of, the, bowes, family, but, her, father, and, her, brother, robert, bowes, were, opposed, to, the, marriage, towards, the, end, of, 1550, knox, was, appointed, a, preacher, of, st, nicholas, church, in, newcastle, upon, tyne, the, following, year, he, was, appointed, one, of, the, six, royal, chaplains, serving, the, king, on, 16, october, 1551, john, dudley, 1st, duke, of, northumberland, overthrew, the, duke, of, somerset, to, become, the, new, regent, of, the, young, king, knox, condemned, the, coup, d, tat, in, a, sermon, on, all, saints, day, when, dudley, visited, newcastle, and, listened, to, his, preaching, in, june, 1552, he, had, mixed, feelings, about, the, firebrand, preacher, but, he, saw, knox, as, a, potential, asset, knox, was, asked, to, come, to, london, to, preach, before, the, court, in, his, first, sermon, he, advocated, a, change, for, the, 1552, book, of, common, prayer, the, liturgy, required, worshippers, to, kneel, during, communion, knox, and, the, other, chaplains, considered, this, to, be, idolatry, it, triggered, a, debate, where, archbishop, cranmer, was, called, upon, to, defend, the, practice, the, result, was, a, compromise, in, which, the, famous, black, rubric, which, declared, that, no, adoration, is, intended, while, kneeling, was, included, in, the, second, edition, soon, afterwards, dudley, who, saw, knox, as, a, useful, political, tool, offered, him, the, bishopric, of, rochester, knox, refused, and, he, returned, to, newcastle, on, 2, february, 1553, cranmer, was, ordered, to, appoint, knox, as, vicar, of, all, hallows, bread, street, in, london, placing, him, under, the, authority, of, the, bishop, of, london, nicholas, ridley, knox, returned, to, london, in, order, to, deliver, a, sermon, before, the, king, and, the, court, during, lent, and, he, again, refused, to, take, the, assigned, post, knox, was, then, told, to, preach, in, buckinghamshire, and, he, remained, there, until, edward, s, death, on, 6, july, edward, s, successor, mary, tudor, re, established, roman, catholicism, in, england, and, restored, the, mass, in, all, the, churches, with, the, country, no, longer, safe, for, protestant, preachers, knox, left, for, the, continent, in, january, 1554, on, the, advice, of, friends, on, the, eve, of, his, flight, he, wrote, sometime, i, have, thought, that, impossible, it, had, been, so, to, have, removed, my, affection, from, the, realm, of, scotland, that, any, realm, or, nation, could, have, been, equal, dear, to, me, but, god, i, take, to, record, in, my, conscience, that, the, troubles, present, and, appearing, to, be, in, the, realm, of, england, are, double, more, dolorous, unto, my, heart, than, ever, were, the, troubles, of, scotland, knox, disembarked, in, dieppe, france, and, continued, to, geneva, where, john, calvin, had, established, his, authority, when, knox, arrived, calvin, was, in, a, difficult, position, he, had, recently, overseen, the, company, of, pastors, which, prosecuted, charges, of, heresy, against, the, scholar, michael, servetus, although, calvin, himself, was, not, capable, of, voting, for, or, against, a, civil, penalty, against, servetus, knox, asked, calvin, four, difficult, political, questions, whether, a, minor, could, rule, by, divine, right, whether, a, female, could, rule, and, transfer, sovereignty, to, her, husband, whether, people, should, obey, ungodly, or, idolatrous, rulers, and, what, party, godly, persons, should, follow, if, they, resisted, an, idolatrous, ruler, calvin, gave, cautious, replies, and, referred, him, to, the, swiss, reformer, heinrich, bullinger, in, z, rich, bullinger, s, responses, were, equally, cautious, but, knox, had, already, made, up, his, mind, on, 20, july, 1554, he, published, a, pamphlet, attacking, mary, tudor, and, the, bishops, who, had, brought, her, to, the, throne, he, also, attacked, the, holy, roman, emperor, charles, v, calling, him, no, less, enemy, to, christ, than, was, nero, in, a, letter, dated, 24, september, 1554, knox, received, an, invitation, from, a, congregation, of, english, exiles, in, frankfurt, to, become, one, of, their, ministers, he, accepted, the, call, with, calvin, s, blessing, but, no, sooner, had, he, arrived, than, he, found, himself, in, a, conflict, the, first, set, of, refugees, to, arrive, in, frankfurt, had, subscribed, to, a, reformed, liturgy, and, used, a, modified, version, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, more, recently, arrived, refugees, however, including, edmund, grindal, the, future, archbishop, of, canterbury, favoured, a, stricter, application, of, the, book, when, knox, and, a, supporting, colleague, william, whittingham, wrote, to, calvin, for, advice, they, were, told, to, avoid, contention, knox, therefore, agreed, on, a, temporary, order, of, service, based, on, a, compromise, between, the, two, sides, this, delicate, balance, was, disturbed, when, a, new, batch, of, refugees, arrived, that, included, richard, cox, one, of, the, principal, authors, of, the, book, of, common, prayer, cox, brought, knox, s, pamphlet, attacking, the, emperor, to, the, attention, of, the, frankfurt, authorities, who, advised, that, knox, leave, his, departure, from, frankfurt, on, 26, march, 1555, marked, his, final, breach, with, the, church, of, england, after, his, return, to, geneva, knox, was, chosen, to, be, the, minister, at, a, new, place, of, worship, petitioned, from, calvin, as, such, he, exerted, an, influence, on, french, protestants, whether, they, were, exiled, in, geneva, or, in, france, in, the, meantime, elizabeth, bowes, wrote, to, knox, asking, him, to, return, to, margery, in, scotland, which, he, did, at, the, end, of, august, despite, initial, doubts, about, the, state, of, the, reformation, in, scotland, knox, found, the, country, significantly, changed, since, he, was, carried, off, in, the, galley, in, 1547, when, he, toured, various, parts, of, scotland, preaching, the, reformed, doctrines, and, liturgy, he, was, welcomed, by, many, of, the, nobility, including, two, future, regents, of, scotland, the, earl, of, moray, and, the, earl, of, mar, though, the, queen, regent, mary, of, guise, made, no, move, against, knox, his, activities, caused, concern, among, the, church, authorities, the, bishops, of, scotland, viewed, him, as, a, threat, to, their, authority, and, summoned, him, to, appear, in, edinburgh, on, 15, may, 1556, he, was, accompanied, to, the, trial, by, so, many, influential, persons, that, the, bishops, decided, to, call, the, hearing, off, knox, was, now, free, to, preach, openly, in, edinburgh, william, keith, the, earl, marischal, was, impressed, and, urged, knox, to, write, to, the, queen, regent, knox, s, unusually, respectful, letter, urged, her, to, support, the, reformation, and, overthrow, the, church, hierarchy, queen, mary, took, the, letter, as, a, joke, and, ignored, it, shortly, after, knox, sent, the, letter, to, the, queen, regent, he, suddenly, announced, that, he, felt, his, duty, was, to, return, to, geneva, in, the, previous, year, on, 1, november, 1555, the, congregation, in, geneva, had, elected, knox, as, their, minister, and, he, decided, to, take, up, the, post, he, wrote, a, final, letter, of, advice, to, his, supporters, and, left, scotland, with, his, wife, and, mother, in, law, he, arrived, in, geneva, on, 13, september, 1556, for, the, next, two, years, he, lived, a, happy, life, in, geneva, he, recommended, geneva, to, his, friends, in, england, as, the, best, place, of, asylum, for, protestants, in, one, letter, he, wrote, i, neither, fear, nor, eschame, to, say, is, the, most, perfect, school, of, christ, that, ever, was, in, the, earth, since, the, days, of, the, apostles, in, other, places, i, confess, christ, to, be, truly, preached, but, manners, and, religion, so, sincerely, reformed, i, have, not, yet, seen, in, any, other, place, knox, led, a, busy, life, in, geneva, he, preached, three, sermons, a, week, each, lasting, well, over, two, hours, the, services, used, a, liturgy, that, was, derived, by, knox, and, other, ministers, from, calvin, s, formes, des, pri, res, eccl, siastiques, the, church, in, which, he, preached, the, glise, de, notre, dame, la, neuve, now, known, as, the, auditoire, de, calvin, had, been, granted, by, the, municipal, authorities, at, calvin, s, request, for, the, use, of, the, english, and, italian, congregations, knox, s, two, sons, nathaniel, and, eleazar, were, born, in, geneva, with, whittingham, and, myles, coverdale, their, respective, godfathers, in, the, summer, of, 1558, knox, published, his, best, known, pamphlet, the, first, blast, of, the, trumpet, against, the, monstruous, regiment, of, women, in, calling, the, regimen, or, rule, of, women, monstruous, he, meant, that, it, was, unnatural, knox, states, that, his, purpose, was, to, demonstrate, how, abominable, before, god, is, the, empire, or, rule, of, a, wicked, woman, yea, of, a, traiteresse, and, bastard, the, women, rulers, that, knox, had, in, mind, were, queen, mary, i, of, england, and, mary, of, guise, the, dowager, queen, of, scotland, and, regent, on, behalf, of, her, daughter, mary, queen, of, scots, this, biblical, position, was, not, unusual, in, knox, s, day, however, even, he, was, aware, that, the, pamphlet, was, dangerously, seditious, he, therefore, published, it, anonymously, and, did, not, tell, calvin, who, denied, knowledge, of, it, until, a, year, after, its, publication, that, he, had, written, it, in, england, the, pamphlet, was, officially, condemned, by, royal, proclamation, the, impact, of, the, document, was, complicated, later, that, year, when, elizabeth, tudor, became, queen, of, england, although, knox, had, not, targeted, elizabeth, he, had, deeply, offended, her, and, she, never, forgave, him, with, a, protestant, on, the, throne, the, english, refugees, in, geneva, prepared, to, return, home, knox, himself, decided, to, return, to, scotland, before, his, departure, various, honours, were, conferred, on, him, including, the, freedom, of, the, city, of, geneva, knox, left, in, january, 1559, but, he, did, not, arrive, in, scotland, until, 2, may, 1559, owing, to, elizabeth, s, refusal, to, issue, him, a, passport, through, england, two, days, after, knox, arrived, in, edinburgh, he, proceeded, to, dundee, where, a, large, number, of, protestant, sympathisers, had, gathered, knox, was, declared, an, outlaw, and, the, queen, regent, summoned, the, protestants, to, stirling, fearing, the, possibility, of, a, summary, trial, and, execution, the, protestants, proceeded, instead, to, perth, a, walled, town, that, could, be, defended, in, case, of, a, siege, at, the, church, of, st, john, the, baptist, knox, preached, a, fiery, sermon, and, a, small, incident, precipitated, into, a, riot, a, mob, poured, into, the, church, and, it, was, soon, gutted, the, mob, then, attacked, two, friaries, blackfriars, and, greyfriars, in, the, town, looting, their, gold, and, silver, and, smashing, images, mary, of, guise, gathered, those, nobles, loyal, to, her, and, a, small, french, army, she, dispatched, the, earl, of, argyll, and, lord, moray, to, offer, terms, and, avert, a, war, she, promised, not, to, send, any, french, troops, into, perth, if, the, protestants, evacuated, the, town, the, protestants, agreed, but, when, the, queen, regent, entered, perth, she, garrisoned, it, with, scottish, soldiers, on, the, french, payroll, this, was, seen, as, treacherous, by, lord, argyll, and, lord, moray, who, both, switched, sides, and, joined, knox, who, now, based, himself, in, st, andrews, knox, s, return, to, st, andrews, fulfilled, the, prophecy, he, made, in, the, galleys, that, he, would, one, day, preach, again, in, its, church, when, he, did, give, a, sermon, the, effect, was, the, same, as, in, perth, the, people, engaged, in, vandalism, and, looting, in, june, 1559, a, protestant, mob, incited, by, the, preaching, of, john, knox, ransacked, the, cathedral, the, interior, of, the, building, was, destroyed, the, cathedral, fell, into, decline, following, the, attack, and, became, a, source, of, building, material, for, the, town, by, 1561, it, had, been, abandoned, and, left, to, fall, into, ruin, with, protestant, reinforcements, arriving, from, neighbouring, counties, the, queen, regent, retreated, to, dunbar, by, now, the, mob, fury, had, spilled, over, central, scotland, her, own, troops, were, on, the, verge, of, mutiny, on, 30, june, the, protestant, lords, of, the, congregation, occupied, edinburgh, though, they, were, able, to, hold, it, for, only, a, month, but, even, before, their, arrival, the, mob, had, already, sacked, the, churches, and, the, friaries, on, 1, july, knox, preached, from, the, pulpit, of, st, giles, the, most, influential, in, the, capital, the, lords, of, the, congregation, negotiated, their, withdrawal, from, edinburgh, by, the, articles, of, leith, signed, 25, july, 1559, and, mary, of, guise, promised, freedom, of, conscience, knox, knew, that, the, queen, regent, would, ask, for, help, from, france, so, he, negotiated, by, letter, under, the, assumed, name, john, sinclair, with, william, cecil, elizabeth, s, chief, adviser, for, english, support, knox, sailed, secretly, to, lindisfarne, off, the, northeast, coast, of, england, at, the, end, of, july, to, meet, james, croft, and, sir, henry, percy, at, berwick, upon, tweed, knox, was, indiscreet, and, news, of, his, mission, soon, reached, mary, of, guise, he, returned, to, edinburgh, telling, croft, he, had, to, return, to, his, flock, and, suggested, that, henry, balnaves, should, go, to, cecil, when, additional, french, troops, arrived, in, leith, edinburgh, s, seaport, the, protestants, responded, by, retaking, edinburgh, this, time, on, 24, october, 1559, the, scottish, nobility, formally, deposed, mary, of, guise, from, the, regency, her, secretary, william, maitland, of, lethington, defected, to, the, protestant, side, bringing, his, administrative, skills, from, then, on, maitland, took, over, the, political, tasks, freeing, knox, for, the, role, of, religious, leader, for, the, final, stage, of, the, revolution, maitland, appealed, to, scottish, patriotism, to, fight, french, domination, following, the, treaty, of, berwick, support, from, england, finally, arrived, and, by, the, end, of, march, a, significant, english, army, joined, the, scottish, protestant, forces, the, sudden, death, of, mary, of, guise, in, edinburgh, castle, on, 10, june, 1560, paved, the, way, for, an, end, to, hostilities, the, signing, of, the, treaty, of, edinburgh, and, the, withdrawal, of, french, and, english, troops, from, scotland, on, 19, july, knox, held, a, national, thanksgiving, service, at, st, giles, on, 1, august, the, scottish, parliament, met, to, settle, religious, issues, knox, and, five, other, ministers, all, called, john, were, called, upon, to, draw, up, a, new, confession, of, faith, within, four, days, the, scots, confession, was, presented, to, parliament, voted, upon, and, approved, a, week, later, the, parliament, passed, three, acts, in, one, day, the, first, abolished, the, jurisdiction, of, the, pope, in, scotland, the, second, condemned, all, doctrine, and, practice, contrary, to, the, reformed, faith, and, the, third, forbade, the, celebration, of, mass, in, scotland, before, the, dissolution, of, parliament, knox, and, the, other, ministers, were, given, the, task, of, organising, the, newly, reformed, church, or, the, kirk, they, would, work, for, several, months, on, the, book, of, discipline, the, document, describing, the, organisation, of, the, new, church, during, this, period, in, december, 1560, knox, s, wife, margery, died, leaving, knox, to, care, for, their, two, sons, aged, three, and, a, half, and, two, years, old, john, calvin, who, had, lost, his, own, wife, in, 1549, wrote, a, letter, of, condolence, parliament, reconvened, on, 15, january, 1561, to, consider, the, book, of, discipline, the, kirk, was, to, be, run, on, democratic, lines, each, congregation, was, free, to, choose, or, reject, its, own, pastor, but, once, he, was, chosen, he, could, not, be, fired, each, parish, was, to, be, self, supporting, as, far, as, possible, the, bishops, were, replaced, by, ten, to, twelve, superintendents, the, plan, included, a, system, of, national, education, based, on, universality, as, a, fundamental, principle, certain, areas, of, law, were, placed, under, ecclesiastical, authority, the, parliament, did, not, approve, the, plan, however, mainly, for, reasons, of, finance, the, kirk, was, to, be, financed, out, of, the, patrimony, of, the, roman, catholic, church, in, scotland, much, of, this, was, now, in, the, hands, of, the, nobles, who, were, reluctant, to, give, up, their, possessions, a, final, decision, on, the, plan, was, delayed, because, of, the, impending, return, of, mary, queen, of, scots, on, 19, august, 1561, cannons, were, fired, in, leith, to, announce, queen, mary, s, arrival, in, scotland, when, she, attended, mass, being, celebrated, in, the, royal, chapel, at, holyrood, palace, five, days, later, this, prompted, a, protest, in, which, one, of, her, servants, was, jostled, the, next, day, she, issued, a, proclamation, that, there, would, be, no, alteration, in, the, current, state, of, religion, and, that, her, servants, should, not, be, molested, or, troubled, many, nobles, accepted, this, but, not, knox, the, following, sunday, he, protested, from, the, pulpit, of, st, giles, as, a, result, just, two, weeks, after, her, return, mary, summoned, knox, she, accused, him, of, inciting, a, rebellion, against, her, mother, and, of, writing, a, book, against, her, own, authority, knox, answered, that, as, long, as, her, subjects, found, her, rule, convenient, he, was, willing, to, accept, her, governance, noting, that, paul, the, apostle, had, been, willing, to, live, under, nero, s, rule, mary, noted, however, that, he, had, written, against, the, principle, of, female, rule, itself, he, responded, that, she, should, not, be, troubled, by, what, had, never, harmed, her, when, mary, asked, him, whether, subjects, had, a, right, to, resist, their, ruler, he, replied, that, if, monarchs, exceeded, their, lawful, limits, they, might, be, resisted, even, by, force, on, 13, december, 1562, mary, sent, for, knox, again, after, he, gave, a, sermon, denouncing, certain, celebrations, which, knox, had, interpreted, as, rejoicing, at, the, expense, of, the, reformation, she, charged, that, knox, spoke, irreverently, of, the, queen, in, order, to, make, her, appear, contemptible, to, her, subjects, after, knox, gave, an, explanation, of, the, sermon, mary, stated, that, she, did, not, blame, knox, for, the, differences, of, opinion, and, asked, that, in, the, future, he, come, to, her, directly, if, he, heard, anything, about, her, that, he, disliked, despite, her, gesture, knox, replied, that, he, would, continue, to, voice, his, convictions, in, his, sermons, and, would, not, wait, upon, her, during, easter, in, 1563, some, priests, in, ayrshire, celebrated, mass, thus, defying, the, law, some, protestants, tried, to, enforce, the, law, themselves, by, apprehending, these, priests, this, prompted, mary, to, summon, knox, for, the, third, time, she, asked, knox, to, use, his, influence, to, promote, religious, toleration, he, defended, their, actions, and, noted, she, was, bound, to, uphold, the, laws, and, if, she, did, not, others, would, mary, surprised, knox, by, agreeing, that, the, priests, would, be, brought, to, justice, the, most, dramatic, interview, between, mary, and, knox, took, place, on, 24, june, 1563, mary, summoned, knox, to, holyrood, after, hearing, that, he, had, been, preaching, against, her, proposed, marriage, to, don, carlos, the, son, of, philip, ii, of, spain, mary, began, by, scolding, knox, then, she, burst, into, tears, what, have, ye, to, do, with, my, marriage, she, asked, and, what, are, ye, within, this, commonwealth, a, subject, born, within, the, same, madam, knox, replied, he, noted, that, though, he, was, not, of, noble, birth, he, had, the, same, duty, as, any, subject, to, warn, of, dangers, to, the, realm, when, mary, started, to, cry, again, he, said, madam, in, god, s, presence, i, speak, i, never, delighted, in, the, weeping, of, any, of, god, s, creatures, yea, i, can, scarcely, well, abide, the, tears, of, my, own, boys, whom, my, own, hand, corrects, much, less, can, i, rejoice, in, your, majesty, s, weeping, he, added, that, he, would, rather, endure, her, tears, however, than, remain, silent, and, betray, my, commonwealth, at, this, mary, ordered, him, out, of, the, room, knox, s, final, encounter, with, mary, was, prompted, by, an, incident, at, holyrood, while, mary, was, absent, from, edinburgh, on, her, summer, progress, in, 1563, a, crowd, forced, its, way, into, her, private, chapel, as, mass, was, being, celebrated, during, the, altercation, the, priest, s, life, was, threatened, as, a, result, two, of, the, ringleaders, burgesses, of, edinburgh, were, scheduled, for, trial, on, 24, october, 1563, in, order, to, defend, these, men, knox, sent, out, letters, calling, the, nobles, to, convene, mary, obtained, one, of, these, letters, and, asked, her, advisors, if, this, was, not, a, treasonable, act, stewart, and, maitland, wanting, to, keep, good, relations, with, both, the, kirk, and, the, queen, asked, knox, to, admit, he, was, wrong, and, to, settle, the, matter, quietly, knox, refused, and, he, defended, himself, in, front, of, mary, and, the, privy, council, he, argued, that, he, had, called, a, legal, not, an, illegal, assembly, as, part, of, his, duties, as, a, minister, of, the, kirk, after, he, left, the, councillors, voted, not, to, charge, him, with, treason, on, 26, march, 1564, knox, stirred, controversy, again, when, he, married, margaret, stewart, the, daughter, of, an, old, friend, andrew, stewart, 2nd, lord, ochiltree, a, member, of, the, stuart, family, and, a, distant, relative, of, the, queen, mary, stuart, the, marriage, was, unusual, because, he, was, a, widower, of, fifty, while, the, bride, was, only, seventeen, very, few, details, are, known, of, their, domestic, life, they, had, three, daughters, martha, margaret, and, elizabeth, when, the, general, assembly, convened, in, june, 1564, an, argument, broke, out, between, knox, and, maitland, over, the, authority, of, the, civil, government, maitland, told, knox, to, refrain, from, stirring, up, emotions, over, mary, s, insistence, on, having, mass, celebrated, and, he, quoted, from, martin, luther, and, john, calvin, about, obedience, to, earthly, rulers, knox, retorted, that, the, bible, notes, that, israel, was, punished, when, it, followed, an, unfaithful, king, and, that, the, continental, reformers, were, refuting, arguments, made, by, the, anabaptists, who, rejected, all, forms, of, government, the, debate, revealed, his, waning, influence, on, political, events, as, the, nobility, continued, to, support, mary, after, the, wedding, of, mary, and, henry, stuart, lord, darnley, on, 29, july, 1565, some, of, the, protestant, nobles, including, james, stewart, 1st, earl, of, moray, rose, up, in, a, rebellion, known, as, the, chaseabout, raid, knox, revealed, his, own, objection, to, the, marriage, while, preaching, in, the, presence, of, the, new, king, consort, on, 19, august, 1565, he, made, passing, allusions, to, ungodly, rulers, which, caused, darnley, to, walk, out, knox, was, summoned, and, prohibited, from, preaching, while, the, court, was, in, edinburgh, on, 9, march, 1566, mary, s, secretary, david, rizzio, was, murdered, by, conspirators, loyal, to, darnley, mary, escaped, from, edinburgh, to, dunbar, and, by, 18, march, returned, with, a, formidable, force, knox, fled, to, kyle, in, ayrshire, where, he, completed, the, major, part, of, his, magnum, opus, history, of, the, reformation, in, scotland, when, he, returned, to, edinburgh, he, found, the, protestant, nobles, divided, over, what, to, do, with, mary, lord, darnley, had, been, murdered, and, the, queen, almost, immediately, married, the, chief, suspect, the, earl, of, bothwell, the, indictment, of, murder, thus, upon, her, she, was, forced, to, abdicate, and, was, imprisoned, in, lochleven, castle, lord, moray, had, become, the, regent, of, king, james, vi, other, old, friends, of, knox, lord, argyll, and, william, kirkcaldy,

sermons, even, to, the, point, of, calling, for, her, death, however, mary, s, life, was, spared, and, she, escaped, on, 2, may, 1568, the, fighting, in, scotland, continued, as, a, civil, war, lord, moray, was, assassinated, on, 23, january, 1570, the, regent, who, succeeded, him, the, earl, of, lennox, was, also, a, victim, of, violence, on, 30, april, 1571, the, controller, of, edinburgh, castle, kirkcaldy, of, grange, ordered, all, enemies, of, the, queen, to, leave, the, city, but, for, knox, his, former, friend, and, fellow, galley, slave, he, made, an, exception, if, knox, did, not, leave, he, could, stay, in, edinburgh, but, only, if, he, remained, captive, in, the, castle, knox, chose, to, leave, and, on, 5, may, he, left, for, st, andrews, he, continued, to, preach, spoke, to, students, and, worked, on, his, history, at, the, end, of, july, 1572, after, a, truce, was, called, he, returned, to, edinburgh, although, by, this, time, exceedingly, feeble, and, his, voice, faint, he, continued, to, preach, at, st, giles, after, inducting, his, successor, james, lawson, of, aberdeen, as, minister, of, st, giles, on, 9, november, knox, returned, to, his, home, for, the, last, time, with, his, friends, and, some, of, the, greatest, scottish, nobles, around, him, he, asked, for, the, bible, to, be, read, aloud, on, his, last, day, 24, november, 1572, his, young, wife, read, from, paul, s, first, letter, to, the, corinthians, a, testimony, to, knox, was, pronounced, at, his, grave, in, the, churchyard, of, st, giles, by, james, douglas, 4th, earl, of, morton, and, newly, elected, regent, of, scotland, here, lies, one, who, never, feared, any, flesh, after, the, churchyard, s, destruction, in, 1633, the, precise, site, of, knox, s, grave, cannot, be, established, in, his, will, knox, claimed, none, have, i, corrupted, none, have, i, defrauded, merchandise, have, i, not, made, the, paltry, sum, of, money, knox, bequeathed, to, his, family, which, would, have, left, them, in, dire, poverty, showed, that, he, had, not, profited, from, his, work, in, the, kirk, the, regent, lord, morton, asked, the, general, assembly, to, continue, paying, his, stipend, to, his, widow, for, one, year, after, his, death, and, the, regent, ensured, that, knox, s, dependents, were, decently, supported, knox, was, survived, by, his, five, children, and, his,

barely, noticed, at, the, time, although, his, funeral, was, attended, by, the, nobles, of, scotland, no, major, politician, or, diplomat, mentioned, his, death, in, their, surviving, letters, mary, queen, of, scots, made, only, two, brief, references, to, him, in, her, letters, however, what, the, rulers, feared, were, knox, s, ideas, more, than, knox, himself, he, was, a, successful, reformer, and, it, was, this, philosophy, of, reformation, that, had, a, great, impact, on, the, english, puritans, he, has, also, been, described, as, having, contributed, to, the, struggle, for, genuine, human, freedom, by, teaching, a, duty, to, oppose, unjust, government, in, order, to, bring, about, moral, and, spiritual, change, his, epitaph, reads, here, lies, one, who, feared, god, so, much, that, he, never, feared, the, face, of, any, man, this, is, a, reference, to, matthew, 10, 28, knox, was, notable, not, so, much, for, the, overthrow, of, roman, catholicism, in, scotland, but, for, assuring, the, replacement, of, the, established, christian, religion, with, presbyterianism, rather, than, anglicanism, knox, was, instrumental, in, the, establishment, of, the, presbyterian, polity, though, it, took, 120, years, following, his, death, for, this, to, be, achieved, in, 1689, meanwhile, he, accepted, the, status, quo, and, was, happy, to, see, his, friends, appointed, bishops, and, archbishops, even, preaching, at, the, inauguration, of, the, protestant, archbishop, of, st, andrews, john, douglas, in, 1571, in, that, regard, knox, is, considered, the, notional, founder, of, the, presbyterian, denomination, whose, members, number, millions, worldwide, a, bust, of, knox, by, david, watson, stevenson, is, in, the, hall, of, heroes, of, the, national, wallace, monument, in,
