critical, of, his, educational, results, in, 1805, heinrich, drowned, in, a, canal, near, their, home, in, hamburg, although, it, was, possible, that, his, death, was, accidental, his, wife, and, son,

doubt, his, mental, health, 43, there, was, in, the, father, s, life, some, dark, and, vague, source, of, fear, which, later, made, him, hurl, himself, to, his, death, from, the, attic, of, his, house, in, hamburg, 88, arthur, showed, similar, moodiness, during, his, youth, and, often, acknowledged, that, he, inherited, it, from, his, father, there, were, other, instances, of, serious, mental, health, problems, on, his, father, s, side, of, the, family, 4, despite, his, hardship, schopenhauer, liked, his, father, and, later, referred, to, him, in, a, positive, light, 90, heinrich, schopenhauer, left, the, family, with, a, significant, inheritance, that, was, split, in, three, among, johanna, and, the, children, arthur, schopenhauer, was, entitled, to, control, of, his, part, when, he, reached, the, age, of, majority, he, invested, it, conservatively, in, government, bonds, and, earned, annual, interest, that, was, more, than, double, the, salary, of, a, university, professor, 136, after, quitting, his, merchant, apprenticeship, with, some, encouragement, from, his, mother, he, dedicated, himself, to, studies, at, the, ernestine, gymnasium, gotha, in, saxe, gotha, altenburg, while, there, he, also, enjoyed, social, life, among, the, local, nobility, spending, large, amounts, of, money, which, deeply, concerned, his, frugal, mother, 128, he, left, the, gymnasium, after, writing, a, satirical, poem, about, one, of, the, schoolmasters, although, arthur, claimed, that, he, left, voluntarily, his, mother, s, letter, indicates, that, he, may, have, been, expelled, 129, arthur, spent, two, years, as, a, merchant, in, honor, of, his, dead, father, during, this, time, he, had, doubts, about, being, able, to, start, a, new, life, as, a, scholar, 120, most, of, his, prior, education, was, as, a, practical, merchant, and, he, had, trouble, learning, latin, a, prerequisite, for, an, academic, career, 117, his, mother, moved, away, with, her, daughter, adele, to, weimar, then, the, centre, of, german, literature, to, enjoy, social, life, among, writers, and, artists, arthur, and, his, mother, did, not, part, on, good, terms, in, one, letter, she, wrote, you, are, unbearable, and, burdensome, and, very, hard, to, live, with, all, your, good, qualities, are, overshadowed, by, your, conceit, and, made, useless, to, the, world, simply, because, you, cannot, restrain, your, propensity, to, pick, holes, in, other, people, his, mother, johanna, was, generally, described, as, vivacious, and, sociable, 9, she, died, 24, years, later, some, of, arthur, s, negative, opinions, about, women, may, be, rooted, in, his, troubled, relationship, with, his, mother, arthur, moved, to, hamburg, to, live, with, his, friend, jean, anthime, who, was, also, studying, to, become, a, merchant, he, moved, to, weimar, but, did, not, live, with, his, mother, who, even, tried, to, discourage, him, from, coming, by, explaining, that, they, would, not, get, along, very, well, 131, their, relationship, deteriorated, even, further, due, to, their, temperamental, differences, he, accused, his, mother, of, being, financially, irresponsible, flirtatious, and, seeking, to, remarry, which, he, considered, an, insult, to, his, father, s, memory, 116, 131, his, mother, while, professing, her, love, to, him, criticized, him, sharply, for, being, moody, tactless, and, argumentative, and, urged, him, to, improve, his, behavior, so, that, he, would, not, alienate, people, 129, arthur, concentrated, on, his, studies, which, were, now, going, very, well, and, he, also, enjoyed, the, usual, social, life, such, as, balls, parties, and, theater, by, that, time, johanna, s, famous, salon, was, well, established, among, local, intellectuals, and, dignitaries, the, most, celebrated, of, them, being, goethe, arthur, attended, her, parties, usually, when, he, knew, that, goethe, would, be, there, although, the, famous, writer, and, statesman, seemed, not, even, to, notice, the, young, and, unknown, student, it, is, possible, that, goethe, kept, a, distance, because, johanna, warned, him, about, her, son, s, depressive, and, combative, nature, or, because, goethe, was, then, on, bad, terms, with, arthur, s, language, instructor, and, roommate, franz, passow, 134, schopenhauer, was, also, captivated, by, the, beautiful, karoline, jagemann, mistress, of, karl, august, grand, duke, of, saxe, weimar, eisenach, and, he, wrote, to, her, his, only, known, love, poem, 135, despite, his, later, celebration, of, asceticism, and, negative, views, of, sexuality, schopenhauer, occasionally, had, sexual, affairs, usually, with, women, of, lower, social, status, such, as, servants, actresses, and, sometimes, even, paid, prostitutes, 21, in, a, letter, to, his, friend, anthime, he, claims, that, such, affairs, continued, even, in, his, mature, age, and, admits, that, he, had, two, out, of, wedlock, daughters, born, in, 1819, and, 1836, both, of, whom, died, in, infancy, 25, in, their, youthful, correspondence, arthur, and, anthime, were, somewhat, boastful, and, competitive, about, their, sexual, exploits, but, schopenhauer, seemed, aware, that, women, usually, did, not, find, him, very, charming, or, physically, attractive, and, his, desires, often, remained, unfulfilled, 22, he, left, weimar, to, become, a, student, at, the, university, of, g, ttingen, in, 1809, there, are, no, written, reasons, about, why, schopenhauer, chose, that, university, instead, of, the, then, more, famous, university, of, jena, but, g, ttingen, was, known, as, more, modern, and, scientifically, oriented, with, less, attention, given, to, theology, 140, law, or, medicine, were, usual, choices, for, young, men, of, schopenhauer, s, status, who, also, needed, career, and, income, he, chose, medicine, due, to, his, scientific, interests, among, his, notable, professors, were, bernhard, friedrich, thibaut, arnold, hermann, ludwig, heeren, johann, friedrich, blumenbach, friedrich, stromeyer, heinrich, adolf, schrader, johann, tobias, mayer, and, konrad, johann, martin, langenbeck, 141, 144, he, studied, metaphysics, psychology, and, logic, under, gottlob, ernst, schulze, the, author, of, aenesidemus, who, made, a, strong, impression, and, advised, him, to, concentrate, on, plato, and, immanuel, kant, 144, he, decided, to, switch, from, medicine, to, philosophy, around, 1810, 11, and, he, left, g, ttingen, which, did, not, have, a, strong, philosophy, program, besides, schulze, the, only, other, philosophy, professor, was, friedrich, bouterwek, whom, schopenhauer, disliked, 150, he, did, not, regret, his, medicinal, and, scientific, studies, he, claimed, that, they, were, necessary, for, a, philosopher, and, even, in, berlin, he, attended, more, lectures, in, sciences, than, in, philosophy, 170, during, his, days, at, g, ttingen, he, spent, considerable, time, studying, but, also, continued, his, flute, playing, and, social, life, his, friends, included, friedrich, gotthilf, osann, karl, witte, christian, charles, josias, von, bunsen, and, william, backhouse, astor, sr, 151, he, arrived, at, the, newly, founded, university, of, berlin, for, the, winter, semester, of, 1811, 12, at, the, same, time, his, mother, had, just, begun, her, literary, career, she, published, her, first, book, in, 1810, a, biography, of, her, friend, karl, ludwig, fernow, which, was, a, critical, success, arthur, attended, lectures, by, the, prominent, post, kantian, philosopher, johann, gottlieb, fichte, but, quickly, found, many, points, of, disagreement, with, his, wissenschaftslehre, he, also, found, fichte, s, lectures, tedious, and, hard, to, understand, 159, he, later, mentioned, fichte, only, in, critical, negative, terms, 159, seeing, his, philosophy, as, a, lower, quality, version, of, kant, s, and, considering, it, useful, only, because, fichte, s, poor, arguments, unintentionally, highlighted, some, failings, of, kantianism, 165, 169, he, also, attended, the, lectures, of, the, famous, protestant, theologian, friedrich, schleiermacher, whom, he, also, quickly, came, to, dislike, 174, his, notes, and, comments, on, schleiermacher, s, lectures, show, that, schopenhauer, was, becoming, very, critical, of, religion, and, moving, towards, atheism, 175, he, learned, by, self, directed, reading, besides, plato, kant, and, fichte, he, also, read, the, works, of, schelling, fries, jacobi, bacon, locke, and, much, current, scientific, literature, 170, he, attended, philological, courses, by, august, b, ckh, and, friedrich, august, wolf, and, continued, his, naturalistic, interests, with, courses, by, martin, heinrich, klaproth, paul, erman, johann, elert, bode, ernst, gottfried, fischer, johann, horkel, friedrich, christian, rosenthal, and, hinrich, lichtenstein, lichtenstein, was, also, a, friend, whom, he, met, at, one, of, his, mother, s, parties, in, weimar, 171, 174, schopenhauer, left, berlin, in, a, rush, in, 1813, fearing, that, the, city, could, be, attacked, and, that, he, could, be, pressed, into, military, service, as, prussia, had, just, joined, the, war, against, france, 179, he, returned, to, weimar, but, left, after, less, than, a, month, disgusted, by, the, fact, that, his, mother, was, now, living, with, her, supposed, lover, georg, friedrich, konrad, ludwig, m, ller, von, gerstenbergk, 1778, 1838, a, civil, servant, twelve, years, younger, than, her, he, considered, the, relationship, an, act, of, infidelity, to, his, father, s, memory, 188, he, settled, for, a, while, in, rudolstadt, hoping, that, no, army, would, pass, through, the, small, town, he, spent, his, time, in, solitude, hiking, in, the, mountains, and, the, thuringian, forest, and, writing, his, dissertation, on, the, fourfold, root, of, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, schopenhauer, completed, his, dissertation, at, about, the, same, time, as, the, french, army, was, defeated, at, the, battle, of, leipzig, he, became, irritated, by, the, arrival, of, soldiers, in, the, town, and, accepted, his, mother, s, invitation, to, visit, her, in, weimar, she, tried, to, convince, him, that, her, relationship, with, gerstenbergk, was, platonic, and, that, she, had, no, intention, of, remarrying, 230, but, schopenhauer, remained, suspicious, and, often, came, in, conflict, with, gerstenbergk, because, he, considered, him, untalented, pretentious, and, nationalistic, 231, his, mother, had, just, published, her, second, book, reminiscences, of, a, journey, in, the, years, 1803, 1804, and, 1805, a, description, of, their, family, tour, of, europe, which, quickly, became, a, hit, she, found, his, dissertation, incomprehensible, and, said, it, was, unlikely, that, anyone, would, ever, buy, a, copy, in, a, fit, of, temper, arthur, told, her, that, people, would, read, his, work, long, after, the, rubbish, she, wrote, was, totally, forgotten, in, fact, although, they, considered, her, novels, of, dubious, quality, the, brockhaus, publishing, firm, held, her, in, high, esteem, because, they, consistently, sold, well, hans, brockhaus, 1888, 1965, later, claimed, that, his, predecessors, saw, nothing, in, this, manuscript, but, wanted, to, please, one, of, our, best, selling, authors, by, publishing, her, son, s, work, we, published, more, and, more, of, her, son, arthur, s, work, and, today, nobody, remembers, johanna, but, her, son, s, works, are, in, steady, demand, and, contribute, to, brockhaus, reputation, he, kept, large, portraits, of, the, pair, in, his, office, in, leipzig, for, the, edification, of, his, new, editors, also, contrary, to, his, mother, s, prediction, schopenhauer, s, dissertation, made, an, impression, on, goethe, to, whom, he, sent, it, as, a, gift, 241, although, it, is, doubtful, that, goethe, agreed, with, schopenhauer, s, philosophical, positions, he, was, impressed, by, his, intellect, and, extensive, scientific, education, 243, their, subsequent, meetings, and, correspondence, were, a, great, honor, to, a, young, philosopher, who, was, finally, acknowledged, by, his, intellectual, hero, they, mostly, discussed, goethe, s, newly, published, and, somewhat, lukewarmly, received, work, on, color, theory, schopenhauer, soon, started, writing, his, own, treatise, on, the, subject, on, vision, and, colors, which, in, many, points, differed, from, his, teacher, s, although, they, remained, polite, towards, each, other, their, growing, theoretical, disagreements, and, especially, schopenhauer, s, extreme, self, confidence, and, tactless, criticisms, soon, made, goethe, become, distant, again, and, after, 1816, their, correspondence, became, less, frequent, 247, 265, schopenhauer, later, admitted, that, he, was, greatly, hurt, by, this, rejection, but, he, continued, to, praise, goethe, and, considered, his, color, theory, a, great, introduction, to, his, own, 252, 256, 265, another, important, experience, during, his, stay, in, weimar, was, his, acquaintance, with, friedrich, majer, a, historian, of, religion, orientalist, and, disciple, of, herder, who, introduced, him, to, eastern, philosophy, 266, see, also, indology, schopenhauer, was, immediately, impressed, by, the, upanishads, he, called, them, the, production, of, the, highest, human, wisdom, and, believed, that, they, contained, superhuman, concepts, and, the, buddha, and, put, them, on, a, par, with, plato, and, kant, 268, 272, he, continued, his, studies, by, reading, the, bhagavad, gita, an, amateurish, german, journal, asiatisches, magazin, and, asiatick, researches, by, the, asiatic, society, 267, 272, schopenhauer, held, a, profound, respect, for, indian, philosophy, although, he, loved, hindu, texts, he, never, revered, a, buddhist, text, but, regarded, buddhism, as, the, most, distinguished, religion, 272, his, studies, on, hindu, and, buddhist, texts, were, constrained, by, the, lack, of, adequate, literature, and, the, latter, were, mostly, restricted, to, theravada, buddhism, he, also, claimed, that, he, formulated, most, of, his, ideas, independently, and, only, later, realized, the, similarities, with, buddhism, 274, 276, schopenhauer, read, the, latin, translation, and, praised, the, upanishads, in, his, main, work, the, world, as, will, and, representation, 1819, as, well, as, in, his, parerga, and, paralipomena, 1851, and, commented, in, the, whole, world, there, is, no, study, so, beneficial, and, so, elevating, as, that, of, the, upanishads, it, has, been, the, solace, of, my, life, it, will, be, the, solace, of, my, death, as, the, relationship, with, his, mother, fell, to, a, new, low, in, may, 1814, he, left, weimar, and, moved, to, dresden, 265, he, continued, his, philosophical, studies, enjoyed, the, cultural, life, socialized, with, intellectuals, and, engaged, in, sexual, affairs, 284, his, friends, in, dresden, were, johann, gottlob, von, quandt, friedrich, laun, karl, christian, friedrich, krause, and, ludwig, sigismund, ruhl, a, young, painter, who, made, a, romanticized, portrait, of, him, in, which, he, improved, some, of, schopenhauer, s, unattractive, physical, features, 278, 283, his, criticisms, of, local, artists, occasionally, caused, public, quarrels, when, he, ran, into, them, in, public, 282, schopenhauer, s, main, occupation, during, his, stay, in, dresden, was, his, seminal, philosophical, work, the, world, as, will, and, representation, which, he, started, writing, in, 1814, and, finished, in, 1818, he, was, recommended, to, the, publisher, friedrich, arnold, brockhaus, by, baron, ferdinand, von, biedenfeld, an, acquaintance, of, his, mother, 285, although, brockhaus, accepted, his, manuscript, schopenhauer, made, a, poor, impression, because, of, his, quarrelsome, and, fussy, attitude, as, well, as, very, poor, sales, of, the, book, after, it, was, published, in, december, 1818, 285, 289, in, september, 1818, while, waiting, for, his, book, to, be, published, and, conveniently, escaping, an, affair, with, a, maid, that, caused, an, unwanted, pregnancy, 342, schopenhauer, left, dresden, for, a, year, long, vacation, in, italy, 346, he, visited, venice, bologna, florence, naples, and, milan, travelling, alone, or, accompanied, by, mostly, english, tourists, he, met, 350, he, spent, the, winter, months, in, rome, where, he, accidentally, met, his, acquaintance, karl, witte, and, engaged, in, numerous, quarrels, with, german, tourists, in, the, caff, greco, among, them, johann, friedrich, b, hmer, who, also, mentioned, his, insulting, remarks, and, unpleasant, character, 348, 349, he, enjoyed, art, architecture, and, ancient, ruins, attended, plays, and, operas, and, continued, his, philosophical, contemplation, and, love, affairs, 346, 350, one, of, his, affairs, supposedly, became, serious, and, for, a, while, he, contemplated, marriage, to, a, rich, italian, noblewoman, but, despite, his, mentioning, this, several, times, no, details, are, known, and, it, may, have, been, schopenhauer, exaggerating, 345, he, corresponded, regularly, with, his, sister, adele, and, became, close, to, her, as, her, relationship, with, johanna, and, gerstenbergk, also, deteriorated, 344, she, informed, him, about, their, financial, troubles, as, the, banking, house, of, a, l, muhl, in, danzig, in, which, her, mother, invested, their, whole, savings, and, arthur, a, third, of, his, was, near, bankruptcy, 351, arthur, offered, to, share, his, assets, but, his, mother, refused, and, became, further, enraged, by, his, insulting, comments, 352, the, women, managed, to, receive, only, thirty, percent, of, their, savings, while, arthur, using, his, business, knowledge, took, a, suspicious, and, aggressive, stance, towards, the, banker, and, eventually, received, his, part, in, full, 354, 356, the, affair, additionally, worsened, the, relationships, among, all, three, members, of, the, schopenhauer, family, 352, 354, he, shortened, his, stay, in, italy, because, of, the, trouble, with, muhl, and, returned, to, dresden, 356, disturbed, by, the, financial, risk, and, the, lack, of, responses, to, his, book, he, decided, to, take, an, academic, position, since, it, provided, him, with, both, income, and, an, opportunity, to, promote, his, views, 358, he, contacted, his, friends, at, universities, in, heidelberg, g, ttingen, and, berlin, and, found, berlin, most, attractive, 358, 362, he, scheduled, his, lectures, to, coincide, with, those, of, the, famous, philosopher, g, w, f, hegel, whom, schopenhauer, described, as, a, clumsy, charlatan, he, was, especially, appalled, by, hegel, s, supposedly, poor, knowledge, of, natural, sciences, and, tried, to, engage, him, in, a, quarrel, about, it, already, at, his, test, lecture, in, march, 1820, 363, hegel, was, also, facing, political, suspicions, at, the, time, when, many, progressive, professors, were, fired, while, schopenhauer, carefully, mentioned, in, his, application, that, he, had, no, interest, in, politics, 362, despite, their, differences, and, the, arrogant, request, to, schedule, lectures, at, the, same, time, as, his, own, hegel, still, voted, to, accept, schopenhauer, to, the, university, 365, only, five, students, turned, up, to, schopenhauer, s, lectures, and, he, dropped, out, of, academia, a, late, essay, on, university, philosophy, expressed, his, resentment, towards, the, work, conducted, in, academies, after, his, trying, in, academia, he, continued, to, travel, extensively, visiting, leipzig, nuremberg, stuttgart, schaffhausen, vevey, milan, and, spending, eight, months, in, florence, 411, before, he, left, for, his, three, year, travel, schopenhauer, had, an, incident, with, his, berlin, neighbor, 47, year, old, seamstress, caroline, louise, marquet, the, details, of, the, august, 1821, incident, are, unknown, he, claimed, that, he, had, just, pushed, her, from, his, entrance, after, she, had, rudely, refused, to, leave, and, that, she, had, purposely, fallen, to, the, ground, so, that, she, could, sue, him, she, claimed, that, he, had, attacked, her, so, violently, that, she, had, become, paralyzed, on, her, right, side, and, unable, to, work, she, immediately, sued, him, and, the, process, lasted, until, may, 1827, when, a, court, found, schopenhauer, guilty, and, forced, him, to, pay, her, an, annual, pension, until, her, death, in, 1842, 408, 411, schopenhauer, enjoyed, italy, where, he, studied, art, and, socialized, with, italian, and, english, nobles, 411, 414, it, was, his, last, visit, to, the, country, he, left, for, munich, and, stayed, there, for, a, year, mostly, recuperating, from, various, health, issues, some, of, them, possibly, caused, by, venereal, diseases, the, treatment, his, doctor, used, suggests, syphilis, 415, he, contacted, publishers, offering, to, translate, hume, into, german, and, kant, into, english, but, his, proposals, were, declined, 417, 422, returning, to, berlin, he, began, to, study, spanish, so, he, could, read, some, of, his, favorite, authors, in, their, original, language, he, liked, pedro, calder, n, de, la, barca, lope, de, vega, miguel, de, cervantes, and, especially, baltasar, graci, n, 420, he, also, made, failed, attempts, to, publish, his, translations, of, their, works, a, few, attempts, to, revive, his, lectures, again, scheduled, at, the, same, time, as, hegel, s, also, failed, as, did, his, inquiries, about, relocating, to, other, universities, 429, 432, during, his, berlin, years, schopenhauer, occasionally, mentioned, his, desire, to, marry, and, have, a, family, 404, 432, for, a, while, he, was, unsuccessfully, courting, 17, year, old, flora, weiss, who, was, 22, years, younger, than, himself, 433, his, unpublished, writings, from, that, time, show, that, he, was, already, very, critical, of, monogamy, but, still, not, advocating, polygyny, instead, musing, about, a, polyamorous, relationship, that, he, called, tetragamy, 404, 408, he, had, an, on, and, off, relationship, with, a, young, dancer, caroline, richter, she, also, used, the, surname, medon, after, one, of, her, ex, lovers, 403, they, met, when, he, was, 33, and, she, was, 19, and, working, at, the, berlin, opera, she, had, already, had, numerous, lovers, and, a, son, out, of, wedlock, and, later, gave, birth, to, another, son, this, time, to, an, unnamed, foreign, diplomat, she, soon, had, another, pregnancy, but, the, child, was, stillborn, 403, 404, as, schopenhauer, was, preparing, to, escape, from, berlin, in, 1831, due, to, a, cholera, epidemic, he, offered, to, take, her, with, him, on, the, condition, that, she, left, her, young, son, behind, 404, she, refused, and, he, went, alone, in, his, will, he, left, her, a, significant, sum, of, money, but, insisted, that, it, should, not, be, spent, in, any, way, on, her, second, son, 404, schopenhauer, claimed, that, in, his, last, year, in, berlin, he, had, a, prophetic, dream, that, urged, him, to, escape, from, the, city, 436, as, he, arrived, in, his, new, home, in, frankfurt, he, supposedly, had, another, supernatural, experience, an, apparition, of, his, dead, father, and, his, mother, who, was, still, alive, 436, this, experience, led, him, to, spend, some, time, investigating, paranormal, phenomena, and, magic, he, was, quite, critical, of, the, available, studies, and, claimed, that, they, were, mostly, ignorant, or, fraudulent, but, he, did, believe, that, there, are, authentic, cases, of, such, phenomena, and, tried, to, explain, them, through, his, metaphysics, as, manifestations, of, the, will, 437, 452, upon, his, arrival, in, frankfurt, he, experienced, a, period, of, depression, and, declining, health, 454, he, renewed, his, correspondence, with, his, mother, and, she, seemed, concerned, that, he, might, commit, suicide, like, his, father, 454, 457, by, now, johanna, and, adele, were, living, very, modestly, johanna, s, writing, did, not, bring, her, much, income, and, her, popularity, was, waning, 458, their, correspondence, remained, reserved, and, arthur, seemed, undisturbed, by, her, death, in, 1838, 460, his, relationship, with, his, sister, grew, closer, and, he, corresponded, with, her, until, she, died, in, 1849, 463, in, july, 1832, schopenhauer, left, frankfurt, for, mannheim, but, returned, in, july, 1833, to, remain, there, for, the, rest, of, his, life, except, for, a, few, short, journeys, 464, he, lived, alone, except, for, a, succession, of, pet, poodles, named, atman, and, butz, in, 1836, he, published, on, the, will, in, nature, in, 1838, he, sent, his, essay, on, the, freedom, of, the, will, to, the, contest, of, the, royal, norwegian, society, of, sciences, in, 1838, and, won, the, prize, in, 1839, he, sent, another, essay, on, the, basis, of, morality, to, the, royal, danish, society, of, sciences, in, 1839, but, did, not, win, the, 1840, prize, despite, being, the, only, contestant, the, society, was, appalled, that, several, distinguished, contemporary, philosophers, were, mentioned, in, a, very, offensive, manner, and, claimed, that, the, essay, missed, the, point, of, the, set, topic, and, that, the, arguments, were, inadequate, 483, schopenhauer, who, had, been, very, confident, that, he, would, win, was, enraged, by, this, rejection, he, published, both, essays, as, the, two, basic, problems, of, ethics, the, first, edition, published, september, 1840, but, with, an, 1841, date, again, failed, to, draw, attention, to, his, philosophy, in, the, preface, to, the, second, edition, in, 1860, he, was, still, pouring, insults, on, the, royal, danish, society, 484, two, years, later, after, some, negotiations, he, managed, to, convince, his, publisher, brockhaus, to, print, the, second, updated, edition, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, that, book, was, again, mostly, ignored, and, the, few, reviews, were, mixed, or, negative, schopenhauer, began, to, attract, some, followers, mostly, outside, academia, among, practical, professionals, several, of, them, were, lawyers, who, pursued, private, philosophical, studies, he, jokingly, referred, to, them, as, evangelists, and, apostles, 504, one, of, the, most, active, early, followers, was, julius, frauenst, dt, who, wrote, numerous, articles, promoting, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, he, was, also, instrumental, in, finding, another, publisher, after, brockhaus, declined, to, publish, parerga, and, paralipomena, believing, that, it, would, be, another, failure, 506, though, schopenhauer, later, stopped, corresponding, with, him, claiming, that, he, did, not, adhere, closely, enough, to, his, ideas, frauenst, dt, continued, to, promote, schopenhauer, s, work, 507, 508, they, renewed, their, communication, in, 1859, and, schopenhauer, named, him, heir, for, his, literary, estate, 508, frauenst, dt, also, became, the, editor, of, the, first, collected, works, of, schopenhauer, 506, in, 1848, schopenhauer, witnessed, violent, upheaval, in, frankfurt, after, general, hans, adolf, erdmann, von, auerswald, and, prince, felix, lichnowsky, were, murdered, he, became, worried, for, his, own, safety, and, property, 514, even, earlier, in, life, he, had, had, such, worries, and, kept, a, sword, and, loaded, pistols, near, his, bed, to, defend, himself, from, thieves, 465, he, gave, a, friendly, welcome, to, austrian, soldiers, who, wanted, to, shoot, revolutionaries, from, his, window, and, as, they, were, leaving, he, gave, one, of, the, officers, his, opera, glasses, to, help, him, monitor, rebels, 514, the, rebellion, passed, without, any, loss, to, schopenhauer, and, he, later, praised, alfred, i, prince, of, windisch, gr, tz, for, restoring, order, 515, he, even, modified, his, will, leaving, a, large, part, of, his, property, to, a, prussian, fund, that, helped, soldiers, who, became, invalids, while, fighting, rebellion, in, 1848, or, the, families, of, soldiers, who, died, in, battle, 517, as, young, hegelians, were, advocating, change, and, progress, schopenhauer, claimed, that, misery, is, natural, for, humans, and, that, even, if, some, utopian, society, were, established, people, would, still, fight, each, other, out, of, boredom, or, would, starve, due, to, overpopulation, 515, in, 1851, schopenhauer, published, parerga, and, paralipomena, which, contains, essays, that, are, supplementary, to, his, main, work, it, was, his, first, successful, widely, read, book, partly, due, to, the, work, of, his, disciples, who, wrote, praising, reviews, 524, the, essays, that, proved, most, popular, were, the, ones, that, actually, did, not, contain, the, basic, philosophical, ideas, of, his, system, 539, many, academic, philosophers, considered, him, a, great, stylist, and, cultural, critic, but, did, not, take, his, philosophy, seriously, 539, his, early, critics, liked, to, point, out, similarities, of, his, ideas, to, those, of, fichte, and, schelling, 381, 386, or, to, claim, that, there, were, numerous, contradictions, in, his, philosophy, 381, 386, 537, both, criticisms, enraged, schopenhauer, he, was, becoming, less, interested, in, intellectual, fights, but, encouraged, his, disciples, to, do, so, 525, his, private, notes, and, correspondence, show, that, he, acknowledged, some, of, the, criticisms, regarding, contradictions, inconsistencies, and, vagueness, in, his, philosophy, but, claimed, that, he, was, not, concerned, about, harmony, and, agreement, in, his, propositions, 394, and, that, some, of, his, ideas, should, not, be, taken, literally, but, instead, as, metaphors, 510, academic, philosophers, were, also, starting, to, notice, his, work, in, 1856, the, university, of, leipzig, sponsored, an, essay, contest, about, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, which, was, won, by, rudolf, seydel, s, very, critical, essay, 536, schopenhauer, s, friend, jules, luntesch, tz, made, the, first, of, his, four, portraits, of, him, which, schopenhauer, did, not, particularly, like, which, was, soon, sold, to, a, wealthy, landowner, carl, ferdinand, wiesike, who, built, a, house, to, display, it, schopenhauer, seemed, flattered, and, amused, by, this, and, would, claim, that, it, was, his, first, chapel, 540, as, his, fame, increased, copies, of, paintings, and, photographs, of, him, were, being, sold, and, admirers, were, visiting, the, places, where, he, had, lived, and, written, his, works, people, visited, frankfurt, s, englischer, hof, to, observe, him, dining, admirers, gave, him, gifts, and, asked, for, autographs, 541, he, complained, that, he, still, felt, isolated, due, to, his, not, very, social, nature, and, the, fact, that, many, of, his, good, friends, had, already, died, from, old, age, 542, he, remained, healthy, in, his, own, old, age, which, he, attributed, to, regular, walks, no, matter, the, weather, and, always, getting, enough, sleep, 544, 545, he, had, a, great, appetite, and, could, read, without, glasses, but, his, hearing, had, been, declining, since, his, youth, and, he, developed, problems, with, rheumatism, 545, he, remained, active, and, lucid, continued, his, reading, writing, and, correspondence, until, his, death, 545, the, numerous, notes, that, he, made, during, these, years, amongst, others, on, aging, were, published, posthumously, under, the, title, senilia, in, the, spring, of, 1860, his, health, began, to, decline, and, he, experienced, shortness, of, breath, and, heart, palpitations, in, september, he, suffered, inflammation, of, the, lungs, and, although, he, was, starting, to, recover, he, remained, very, weak, 546, the, last, friend, to, visit, him, was, wilhelm, gwinner, according, to, him, schopenhauer, was, concerned, that, he, would, not, be, able, to, finish, his, planned, additions, to, parerga, and, paralipomena, but, was, at, peace, with, dying, 546, 547, he, died, of, pulmonary, respiratory, failure, on, 21, september, 1860, while, sitting, at, home, on, his, couch, he, died, at, the, age, of, 72, and, had, a, funeral, conducted, by, a, lutheran, minister, in, november, 1813, goethe, invited, schopenhauer, to, help, him, on, his, theory, of, colours, although, schopenhauer, considered, colour, theory, a, minor, matter, he, accepted, the, invitation, out, of, admiration, for, goethe, nevertheless, these, investigations, led, him, to, his, most, important, discovery, in, epistemology, finding, a, demonstration, for, the, a, priori, nature, of, causality, kant, openly, admitted, that, it, was, hume, s, skeptical, assault, on, causality, that, motivated, the, critical, investigations, in, critique, of, pure, reason, and, gave, an, elaborate, proof, to, show, that, causality, is, a, priori, after, g, e, schulze, had, made, it, plausible, that, kant, had, not, disproven, hume, s, skepticism, it, was, up, to, those, loyal, to, kant, s, project, to, prove, this, important, matter, the, difference, between, the, approaches, of, kant, and, schopenhauer, was, this, kant, simply, declared, that, the, empirical, content, of, perception, is, given, to, us, from, outside, an, expression, with, which, schopenhauer, often, expressed, his, dissatisfaction, he, on, the, other, hand, was, occupied, with, the, questions, how, do, we, get, this, empirical, content, of, perception, how, is, it, possible, to, comprehend, subjective, sensations, limited, to, my, skin, as, the, objective, perception, of, things, that, lie, outside, of, me, the, sensations, in, the, hand, of, a, man, born, blind, on, feeling, an, object, of, cubic, shape, are, quite, uniform, and, the, same, on, all, sides, and, in, every, direction, the, edges, it, is, true, press, upon, a, smaller, portion, of, his, hand, still, nothing, at, all, like, a, cube, is, contained, in, these, sensations, his, understanding, draws, the, immediate, and, intuitive, conclusion, from, the, resistance, felt, that, this, resistance, must, have, a, cause, which, then, presents, itself, through, that, conclusion, as, a, hard, body, and, through, the, movements, of, his, arms, in, feeling, the, object, while, the, hand, s, sensation, remains, unaltered, he, constructs, the, cubic, shape, in, space, if, the, representation, of, a, cause, and, of, space, together, with, their, laws, had, not, already, existed, within, him, the, image, of, a, cube, could, never, have, proceeded, from, those, successive, sensations, in, his, hand, causality, is, therefore, not, an, empirical, concept, drawn, from, objective, perceptions, as, hume, had, maintained, instead, as, kant, had, said, objective, perception, presupposes, knowledge, of, causality, by, this, intellectual, operation, comprehending, every, effect, in, our, sensory, organs, as, having, an, external, cause, the, external, world, arises, with, vision, finding, the, cause, is, essentially, simplified, due, to, light, acting, in, straight, lines, we, are, seldom, conscious, of, the, process, that, interprets, the, double, sensation, in, both, eyes, as, coming, from, one, object, that, inverts, the, impressions, on, the, retinas, and, that, uses, the, change, in, the, apparent, position, of, an, object, relative, to, more, distant, objects, provided, by, binocular, vision, to, perceive, depth, and, distance, schopenhauer, stresses, the, importance, of, the, intellectual, nature, of, perception, the, senses, furnish, the, raw, material, by, which, the, intellect, produces, the, world, as, representation, he, set, out, his, theory, of, perception, for, the, first, time, in, on, vision, and, colors, and, in, the, subsequent, editions, of, fourfold, root, an, extensive, exposition, is, given, in, 21, schopenhauer, saw, his, philosophy, as, an, extension, of, kant, s, and, used, the, results, of, kantian, epistemological, investigation, transcendental, idealism, as, starting, point, for, his, own, kant, had, argued, that, the, empirical, world, is, merely, a, complex, of, appearances, whose, existence, and, connection, occur, only, in, our, mental, representations, schopenhauer, did, not, deny, that, the, external, world, existed, empirically, but, followed, kant, in, claiming, that, our, knowledge, and, experience, of, the, world, is, always, indirect, schopenhauer, reiterates, this, in, the, first, sentence, of, his, main, work, the, world, is, my, representation, die, welt, ist, meine, vorstellung, everything, that, there, is, for, cognition, the, entire, world, exists, simply, as, an, object, in, relation, to, a, subject, a, representation, to, a, subject, everything, that, belongs, to, the, world, is, therefore, subject, dependent, in, book, one, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, schopenhauer, considers, the, world, from, this, angle, that, is, insofar, as, it, is, representation, kant, had, previously, argued, that, we, perceive, reality, as, something, spatial, and, temporal, not, because, reality, is, inherently, spatial, and, temporal, but, because, that, is, how, our, minds, operate, in, perceiving, an, object, therefore, understanding, objects, in, space, and, time, represents, our, contribution, to, an, experience, for, schopenhauer, kant, s, greatest, service, lay, in, the, differentiation, between, phenomena, and, the, thing, in, itself, noumena, based, on, the, proof, that, between, everything, and, us, there, is, always, a, perceiving, mind, in, other, words, kant, s, primary, achievement, is, to, demonstrate, that, instead, of, being, a, blank, slate, where, reality, merely, reveals, its, character, the, mind, with, sensory, support, actively, participates, in, constructing, reality, thus, schopenhauer, believed, that, kant, had, shown, that, the, everyday, world, of, experience, and, indeed, the, entire, material, world, related, to, space, and, time, is, merely, appearance, or, phenomena, entirely, distinct, from, the, thing, in, itself, in, book, two, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, schopenhauer, considers, what, the, world, is, beyond, the, aspect, of, it, that, appears, to, us, that, is, the, aspect, of, the, world, beyond, representation, the, world, considered, in, itself, or, noumena, its, inner, essence, the, very, being, in, itself, of, all, things, schopenhauer, argues, is, will, wille, the, empirical, world, that, appears, to, us, as, representation, has, plurality, and, is, ordered, in, a, spatio, temporal, framework, the, world, as, thing, in, itself, must, exist, outside, the, subjective, forms, of, space, and, time, although, the, world, manifests, itself, to, our, experience, as, a, multiplicity, of, objects, the, objectivation, of, the, will, each, element, of, this, multiplicity, has, the, same, blind, essence, striving, towards, existence, and, life, human, rationality, is, merely, a, secondary, phenomenon, that, does, not, distinguish, humanity, from, the, rest, of, nature, at, the, fundamental, essential, level, the, advanced, cognitive, abilities, of, human, beings, schopenhauer, argues, serve, the, ends, of, willing, an, illogical, directionless, ceaseless, striving, that, condemns, the, human, individual, to, a, life, of, suffering, unredeemed, by, any, final, purpose, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, of, the, will, as, the, essential, reality, behind, the, world, as, representation, is, often, called, metaphysical, voluntarism, for, schopenhauer, understanding, the, world, as, will, leads, to, ethical, concerns, see, the, ethics, section, below, for, further, detail, which, he, explores, in, the, fourth, book, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, and, again, in, his, two, prize, essays, on, ethics, on, the, freedom, of, the, will, and, on, the, basis, of, morality, no, individual, human, actions, are, free, schopenhauer, argues, because, they, are, events, in, the, world, of, appearance, and, thus, are, subject, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, a, person, s, actions, are, a, necessary, consequence, of, motives, and, the, given, character, of, the, individual, human, necessity, extends, to, the, actions, of, human, beings, just, as, it, does, to, every, other, appearance, and, thus, we, cannot, speak, of, freedom, of, individual, willing, albert, einstein, quoted, the, schopenhauerian, idea, that, a, man, can, do, as, he, will, but, not, will, as, he, will, yet, the, will, as, thing, in, itself, is, free, as, it, exists, beyond, the, realm, of, representation, and, thus, is, not, constrained, by, any, of, the, forms, of, necessity, that, are, part, of, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, according, to, schopenhauer, salvation, from, our, miserable, existence, can, come, through, the, will, s, being, tranquillized, by, the, metaphysical, insight, that, reveals, individuality, to, be, merely, an, illusion, the, saint, or, great, soul, intuitively, recognizes, the, whole, comprehends, its, essence, and, finds, that, it, is, constantly, passing, away, caught, up, in, vain, strivings, inner, conflict, and, perpetual, suffering, the, negation, of, the, will, in, other, words, stems, from, the, insight, that, the, world, in, itself, free, from, the, forms, of, space, and, time, is, one, ascetic, practices, schopenhauer, remarks, are, used, to, aid, the, will, s, self, abolition, which, brings, about, a, blissful, redemptive, will, less, state, of, emptiness, that, is, free, from, striving, or, suffering, for, schopenhauer, human, willing, desiring, craving, etc, is, at, the, root, of, suffering, a, temporary, way, to, escape, this, pain, is, through, aesthetic, contemplation, here, one, moves, away, from, ordinary, cognizance, of, individual, things, to, cognizance, of, eternal, platonic, ideas, in, other, words, cognizance, that, is, free, from, the, service, of, will, in, aesthetic, contemplation, one, no, longer, perceives, an, object, of, perception, as, something, from, which, one, is, separated, rather, it, is, as, if, the, object, alone, existed, without, anyone, perceiving, it, and, one, can, thus, no, longer, separate, the, perceiver, from, the, perception, but, the, two, have, become, one, the, entirety, of, consciousness, entirely, filled, and, occupied, by, a, single, perceptual, image, subject, and, object, are, no, longer, distinguishable, and, the, idea, comes, to, the, fore, from, this, aesthetic, immersion, one, is, no, longer, an, individual, who, suffers, as, a, result, of, servitude, to, one, s, individual, will, but, rather, becomes, a, pure, will, less, painless, timeless, subject, of, cognition, the, pure, will, less, subject, of, cognition, is, cognizant, only, of, ideas, not, individual, things, this, is, a, kind, of, cognition, that, is, unconcerned, with, relations, between, objects, according, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, time, space, cause, and, effect, and, instead, involves, complete, absorption, in, the, object, art, is, the, practical, consequence, of, this, brief, aesthetic, contemplation, since, it, attempts, to, depict, the, essence, pure, ideas, of, the, world, music, for, schopenhauer, is, the, purest, form, of, art, because, it, is, the, one, that, depicts, the, will, itself, without, it, appearing, as, subject, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, therefore, as, an, individual, object, according, to, daniel, albright, schopenhauer, thought, that, music, was, the, only, art, that, did, not, merely, copy, ideas, but, actually, embodied, the, will, itself, he, deemed, music, a, timeless, universal, language, comprehended, everywhere, that, can, imbue, global, enthusiasm, if, in, possession, of, a, significant, melody, schopenhauer, s, realist, views, on, mathematics, are, evident, in, his, criticism, of, contemporaneous, attempts, to, prove, the, parallel, postulate, in, euclidean, geometry, writing, shortly, before, the, discovery, of, hyperbolic, geometry, demonstrated, the, logical, independence, of, the, axiom, and, long, before, the, general, theory, of, relativity, revealed, that, it, does, not, necessarily, express, a, property, of, physical, space, schopenhauer, criticized, mathematicians, for, trying, to, use, indirect, concepts, to, prove, what, he, held, was, directly, evident, from, intuitive, perception, the, euclidean, method, of, demonstration, has, brought, forth, from, its, own, womb, its, most, striking, parody, and, caricature, in, the, famous, controversy, over, the, theory, of, parallels, and, in, the, attempts, repeated, every, year, to, prove, the, eleventh, axiom, also, known, as, the, fifth, postulate, the, axiom, asserts, and, that, indeed, through, the, indirect, criterion, of, a, third, intersecting, line, that, two, lines, inclined, to, each, other, for, this, is, the, precise, meaning, of, less, than, two, right, angles, if, produced, far, enough, must, meet, now, this, truth, is, supposed, to, be, too, complicated, to, pass, as, self, evident, and, therefore, needs, a, proof, but, no, such, proof, can, be, produced, just, because, there, is, nothing, more, immediate, throughout, his, writings, schopenhauer, criticized, the, logical, derivation, of, philosophies, and, mathematics, from, mere, concepts, instead, of, from, intuitive, perceptions, in, fact, it, seems, to, me, that, the, logical, method, is, in, this, way, reduced, to, an, absurdity, but, it, is, precisely, through, the, controversies, over, this, together, with, the, futile, attempts, to, demonstrate, the, directly, certain, as, merely, indirectly, certain, that, the, independence, and, clearness, of, intuitive, evidence, appear, in, contrast, with, the, uselessness, and, difficulty, of, logical, proof, a, contrast, as, instructive, as, it, is, amusing, the, direct, certainty, will, not, be, admitted, here, just, because, it, is, no, merely, logical, certainty, following, from, the, concept, and, thus, resting, solely, on, the, relation, of, predicate, to, subject, according, to, the, principle, of, contradiction, but, that, eleventh, axiom, regarding, parallel, lines, is, a, synthetic, proposition, a, priori, and, as, such, has, the, guarantee, of, pure, not, empirical, perception, this, perception, is, just, as, immediate, and, certain, as, is, the, principle, of, contradiction, itself, from, which, all, proofs, originally, derive, their, certainty, at, bottom, this, holds, good, of, every, geometrical, theorem, although, schopenhauer, could, see, no, justification, for, trying, to, prove, euclid, s, parallel, postulate, he, did, see, a, reason, for, examining, another, of, euclid, s, axioms, it, surprises, me, that, the, eighth, axiom, figures, that, coincide, with, one, another, are, equal, to, one, another, is, not, rather, attacked, for, coinciding, with, one, another, is, either, a, mere, tautology, or, something, quite, empirical, belonging, not, to, pure, intuition, or, perception, but, to, external, sensuous, experience, thus, it, presupposes, mobility, of, the, figures, but, matter, alone, is, movable, in, space, consequently, this, reference, to, coincidence, with, one, another, forsakes, pure, space, the, sole, element, of, geometry, in, order, to, pass, over, to, the, material, and, empirical, this, follows, kant, s, reasoning, schopenhauer, asserts, that, the, task, of, ethics, is, not, to, prescribe, moral, actions, that, ought, to, be, done, but, to, investigate, moral, actions, as, such, he, states, that, philosophy, is, always, theoretical, its, task, to, explain, what, is, given, according, to, kant, s, transcendental, idealism, space, and, time, are, forms, of, our, sensibility, in, which, phenomena, appear, in, multiplicity, reality, in, itself, is, free, from, multiplicity, not, in, the, sense, that, an, object, is, one, but, that, it, is, outside, the, possibility, of, multiplicity, two, individuals, though, they, appear, distinct, are, in, themselves, not, distinct, appearances, are, entirely, subordinated, to, the, principle, of, sufficient, reason, the, egoistic, individual, who, focuses, his, aims, on, his, own, interests, has, to, deal, with, empirical, laws, as, well, as, he, can, what, is, relevant, for, ethics, are, individuals, who, can, act, against, their, own, self, interest, if, we, take, a, man, who, suffers, when, he, sees, his, fellow, men, living, in, poverty, and, consequently, uses, a, significant, part, of, his, income, to, support, their, needs, instead, of, his, own, pleasures, then, the, simplest, way, to, describe, this, is, that, he, makes, less, distinction, between, himself, and, others, than, is, usually, made, regarding, how, things, appear, to, us, the, egoist, asserts, a, gap, between, two, individuals, but, the, altruist, experiences, the, sufferings, of, others, as, his, own, in, the, same, way, a, compassionate, man, cannot, hurt, animals, though, they, appear, as, distinct, from, himself, what, motivates, the, altruist, is, compassion, the, suffering, of, others, is, for, him, not, a, cold, matter, to, which, he, is, indifferent, but, he, feels, connectiveness, to, all, beings, compassion, is, thus, the, basis, of, morality, schopenhauer, calls, the, principle, through, which, multiplicity, appears, the, principium, individuationis, when, we, behold, nature, we, see, that, it, is, a, cruel, battle, for, existence, individual, manifestations, of, the, will, can, maintain, themselves, only, at, the, expense, of, others, the, will, as, the, only, thing, that, exists, has, no, other, option, but, to, devour, itself, to, experience, pleasure, this, is, a, fundamental, characteristic, of, the, will, and, cannot, be, circumvented, unlike, temporal, or, human, justice, which, requires, time, to, repay, an, evil, deed, and, has, its, seat, in, the, state, as, requiting, and, punishing, eternal, justice, rules, not, the, state, but, the, world, is, not, dependent, upon, human, institutions, is, not, subject, to, chance, and, deception, is, not, uncertain, wavering, and, erring, but, infallible, fixed, and, sure, eternal, justice, is, not, retributive, because, retribution, requires, time, there, are, no, delays, or, reprieves, instead, punishment, is, tied, to, the, offence, to, the, point, where, the, two, become, one, tormenter, and, tormented, are, one, the, errs, in, that, he, believes, he, is, not, a, partaker, in, the, suffering, the, in, that, he, believes, he, is, not, a, partaker, in, the, guilt, suffering, is, the, moral, outcome, of, our, attachment, to, pleasure, schopenhauer, deemed, that, this, truth, was, expressed, by, the, christian, dogma, of, original, sin, and, in, eastern, religions, by, the, dogma, of, rebirth, he, who, sees, through, the, principium, individuationis, and, comprehends, suffering, in, general, as, his, own, will, see, suffering, everywhere, and, instead, of, fighting, for, the, happiness, of, his, individual, manifestation, will, abhor, life, itself, since, he, knows, that, it, is, inseparably, connected, with, suffering, for, him, a, happy, individual, life, in, a, world, of, suffering, is, like, a, beggar, who, dreams, one, night, that, he, is, a, king, those, who, have, experienced, this, intuitive, knowledge, cannot, affirm, life, but, exhibit, asceticism, and, quietism, meaning, that, they, are, no, longer, sensitive, to, motives, are, not, concerned, about, their, individual, welfare, and, accept, without, resistance, the, evil, that, others, inflict, on, them, they, welcome, poverty, and, neither, seek, nor, flee, death, schopenhauer, referred, to, asceticism, as, the, denial, of, the, will, to, live, human, life, is, a, ceaseless, struggle, for, satisfaction, and, instead, of, continuing, their, struggle, ascetics, break, it, it, does, not, matter, if, these, ascetics, adhere, to, the, dogmata, of, christianity, or, to, dharmic, religions, since, their, way, of, living, is, the, result, of, intuitive, knowledge, the, christian, mystic, and, the, teacher, of, the, vedanta, philosophy, agree, in, this, respect, also, they, both, regard, all, outward, works, and, religious, exercises, as, superfluous, for, him, who, has, attained, to, perfection, so, much, agreement, in, the, case, of, such, different, ages, and, nations, is, a, practical, proof, that, what, is, expressed, here, is, not, as, optimistic, dullness, likes, to, assert, an, eccentricity, and, perversity, of, the, mind, but, an, essential, side, of, human, nature, which, only, appears, so, rarely, because, of, its, excellence, philosophers, have, not, traditionally, been, impressed, by, the, necessity, of, sex, but, schopenhauer, addressed, sex, and, related, concepts, forthrightly, one, ought, rather, to, be, surprised, that, a, thing, which, plays, throughout, so, important, a, part, in, human, life, has, hitherto, practically, been, disregarded, by, philosophers, altogether, and, lies, before, us, as, raw, and, untreated, material, he, named, a, force, within, man, that, he, felt, took, invariable, precedence, over, reason, the, will, to, live, or, will, to, life, wille, zum, leben, defined, as, an, inherent, drive, within, human, beings, and, all, creatures, to, stay, alive, a, force, that, inveigles, us, into, reproducing, schopenhauer, refused, to, conceive, of, love, as, either, trifling, or, accidental, but, rather, understood, it, as, an, immensely, powerful, force, that, lay, unseen, within, man, s, psyche, guaranteeing, the, quality, of, the, human, race, the, ultimate, aim, of, all, love, affairs, is, more, important, than, all, other, aims, in, man, s, life, and, therefore, it, is, quite, worthy, of, the, profound, seriousness, with, which, everyone, pursues, it, what, is, decided, by, it, is, nothing, less, than, the, composition, of, the, next, generation, it, has, often, been, argued, that, schopenhauer, s, thoughts, on, sexuality, foreshadowed, the, theory, of, evolution, a, claim, met, with, satisfaction, by, darwin, as, he, included, a, quotation, from, schopenhauer, in, his, descent, of, man, this, has, also, been, noted, about, freud, s, concepts, of, the, libido, and, the, unconscious, mind, and, evolutionary, psychology, in, general, schopenhauer, s, politics, were, an, echo, of, his, system, of, ethics, which, he, elucidated, in, detail, in, his, die, beiden, grundprobleme, der, ethik, the, two, essays, on, the, freedom, of, the, will, and, on, the, basis, of, morality, in, occasional, political, comments, in, his, parerga, and, paralipomena, and, manuscript, remains, schopenhauer, described, himself, as, a, proponent, of, limited, government, schopenhauer, shared, the, view, of, thomas, hobbes, on, the, necessity, of, the, state, and, state, action, to, check, the, innate, destructive, tendencies, of, our, species, he, also, defended, the, independence, of, the, legislative, judicial, and, executive, branches, of, power, and, a, monarch, as, an, impartial, element, able, to, practise, justice, in, a, practical, and, everyday, sense, not, a, cosmological, one, he, declared, that, monarchy, is, natural, to, man, in, almost, the, same, way, as, it, is, to, bees, and, ants, to, cranes, in, flight, to, wandering, elephants, to, wolves, in, a, pack, in, search, of, prey, and, to, other, animals, intellect, in, monarchies, he, writes, always, has, much, better, chances, against, stupidity, its, implacable, and, ever, present, foe, than, it, has, in, republics, but, this, is, a, great, advantage, on, the, other, hand, schopenhauer, disparaged, republicanism, as, being, as, unnatural, to, man, as, it, is, unfavorable, to, higher, intellectual, life, and, thus, to, the, arts, and, sciences, by, his, own, admission, schopenhauer, did, not, give, much, thought, to, politics, and, several, times, he, wrote, proudly, of, how, little, attention, he, paid, to, political, affairs, of, day, in, a, life, that, spanned, several, revolutions, in, french, and, german, government, and, a, few, continent, shaking, wars, he, maintained, his, position, of, minding, not, the, times, but, the, eternities, he, wrote, many, disparaging, remarks, about, germany, and, the, germans, a, typical, example, is, for, a, german, it, is, even, good, to, have, somewhat, lengthy, words, in, his, mouth, for, he, thinks, slowly, and, they, give, him, time, to, reflect, the, state, schopenhauer, claimed, punishes, criminals, to, prevent, future, crimes, it, places, beside, every, possible, motive, for, committing, a, wrong, a, more, powerful, motive, for, leaving, it, undone, in, the, inescapable, punishment, accordingly, the, criminal, code, is, as, complete, a, register, as, possible, of, counter, motives, to, all, criminal, actions, that, can, possibly, be, imagined, he, claimed, that, this, doctrine, was, not, original, to, him, but, had, appeared, in, the, writings, of, plato, seneca, hobbes, pufendorf, and, anselm, feuerbach, schopenhauer, attributed, civilizational, primacy, to, the, northern, white, races, due, to, their, sensitivity, and, creativity, except, for, the, ancient, egyptians, and, hindus, whom, he, saw, as, equal, the, highest, civilization, and, culture, apart, from, the, ancient, hindus, and, egyptians, are, found, exclusively, among, the, white, races, and, even, with, many, dark, peoples, the, ruling, caste, or, race, is, fairer, in, colour, than, the, rest, and, has, therefore, evidently, immigrated, for, example, the, brahmans, the, incas, and, the, rulers, of, the, south, sea, islands, all, this, is, due, to, the, fact, that, necessity, is, the, mother, of, invention, because, those, tribes, that, emigrated, early, to, the, north, and, there, gradually, became, white, had, to, develop, all, their, intellectual, powers, and, invent, and, perfect, all, the, arts, in, their, struggle, with, need, want, and, misery, which, in, their, many, forms, were, brought, about, by, the, climate, this, they, had, to, do, in, order, to, make, up, for, the, parsimony, of, nature, and, out, of, it, all, came, their, high, civilization, schopenhauer, was, fervently, opposed, to, slavery, speaking, of, the, treatment, of, slaves, in, the, slave, holding, states, of, the, united, states, he, condemned, those, devils, in, human, form, those, bigoted, church, going, strict, sabbath, observing, scoundrels, especially, the, anglican, parsons, among, them, for, how, they, treat, their, innocent, black, brothers, who, through, violence, and, injustice, have, fallen, into, their, devil, s, claws, the, slave, holding, states, of, north, america, schopenhauer, writes, are, a, disgrace, to, the, whole, of, humanity, schopenhauer, also, maintained, a, marked, metaphysical, and, political, anti, judaism, he, argued, that, christianity, constituted, a, revolt, against, what, he, styled, the, materialistic, basis, of, judaism, exhibiting, an, indian, influenced, ethics, reflecting, the, aryan, vedic, theme, of, spiritual, self, conquest, he, saw, this, as, opposed, to, the, ignorant, drive, toward, earthly, utopianism, and, superficiality, of, a, worldly, jewish, spirit, is, therefore, the, crudest, and, poorest, of, all, religions, and, consists, merely, in, an, absurd, and, revolting, theism, it, amounts, to, this, that, the, who, has, created, the, world, desires, to, be, worshipped, and, adored, and, so, above, all, he, is, jealous, is, envious, of, his, colleagues, of, all, the, other, gods, if, sacrifices, are, made, to, them, he, is, furious, and, his, jews, have, a, bad, time, it, is, most, deplorable, that, this, religion, has, become, the, basis, of, the, prevailing, religion, of, europe, for, it, is, a, religion, without, any, metaphysical, tendency, while, all, other, religions, endeavor, to, explain, to, the, people, by, symbols, the, metaphysical, significance, of, life, the, religion, of, the, jews, is, entirely, immanent, and, furnishes, nothing, but, a, mere, war, cry, in, the, struggle, with, other, nations, in, his, 1851, essay, on, women, schopenhauer, expressed, opposition, to, what, he, called, teutonico, christian, stupidity, of, reflexive, unexamined, reverence, for, the, female, abgeschmackten, weiberveneration, he, wrote, women, are, directly, fitted, for, acting, as, the, nurses, and, teachers, of, our, early, childhood, by, the, fact, that, they, are, themselves, childish, frivolous, and, short, sighted, he, opined, that, women, are, deficient, in, artistic, faculties, and, sense, of, justice, and, expressed, his, opposition, to, monogamy, he, claimed, that, woman, is, by, nature, meant, to, obey, the, essay, does, give, some, compliments, women, are, decidedly, more, sober, in, their, judgment, than, are, and, are, more, sympathetic, to, the, suffering, of, others, schopenhauer, s, writings, influenced, many, from, friedrich, nietzsche, to, nineteenth, century, feminists, his, biological, analysis, of, the, difference, between, the, sexes, and, their, separate, roles, in, the, struggle, for, survival, and, reproduction, anticipates, some, of, the, claims, that, were, later, ventured, by, sociobiologists, and, evolutionary, psychologists, when, the, elderly, schopenhauer, sat, for, a, sculpture, portrait, by, the, prussian, sculptor, elisabet, ney, in, 1859, he, was, much, impressed, by, the, young, woman, s, wit, and, independence, as, well, as, by, her, skill, as, a, visual, artist, after, his, time, with, ney, he, told, richard, wagner, s, friend, malwida, von, meysenbug, i, have, not, yet, spoken, my, last, word, about, women, i, believe, that, if, a, woman, succeeds, in, withdrawing, from, the, mass, or, rather, raising, herself, above, the, mass, she, grows, ceaselessly, and, more, than, a, man, in, the, third, expanded, edition, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, 1859, schopenhauer, added, an, appendix, to, his, chapter, on, the, metaphysics, of, sexual, love, he, wrote, that, pederasty, has, the, benefit, of, preventing, ill, begotten, children, concerning, this, he, stated, that, the, vice, we, are, considering, appears, to, work, directly, against, the, aims, and, ends, of, nature, and, that, in, a, matter, that, is, all, important, and, of, the, greatest, concern, to, her, it, must, in, fact, serve, these, very, aims, although, only, indirectly, as, a, means, for, preventing, greater, evils, schopenhauer, ends, the, appendix, with, the, statement, that, by, expounding, these, paradoxical, ideas, i, wanted, to, grant, to, the, professors, of, philosophy, a, small, favour, i, have, done, so, by, giving, them, the, opportunity, of, slandering, me, by, saying, that, i, defend, and, commend, pederasty, schopenhauer, viewed, personality, and, intellect, as, inherited, he, quotes, horace, s, saying, from, the, brave, and, good, are, the, brave, descended, odes, iv, 4, 29, and, shakespeare, s, line, from, cymbeline, cowards, father, cowards, and, base, things, sire, base, iv, 2, to, reinforce, his, hereditarian, argument, mechanistically, schopenhauer, believed, that, a, person, inherits, his, intellect, through, his, mother, and, personal, character, through, the, father, this, belief, in, heritability, of, traits, informed, schopenhauer, s, view, of, love, placing, it, at, the, highest, level, of, importance, for, schopenhauer, the, final, aim, of, all, love, intrigues, be, they, comic, or, tragic, is, really, of, more, importance, than, all, other, ends, in, human, life, what, it, all, turns, upon, is, nothing, less, than, the, composition, of, the, next, generation, it, is, not, the, weal, or, woe, of, any, one, individual, but, that, of, the, human, race, to, come, which, is, here, at, stake, this, view, of, the, importance, for, the, species, of, whom, we, choose, to, love, was, reflected, in, his, views, on, eugenics, or, good, breeding, here, schopenhauer, wrote, with, our, knowledge, of, the, complete, unalterability, both, of, character, and, of, mental, faculties, we, are, led, to, the, view, that, a, real, and, thorough, improvement, of, the, human, race, might, be, reached, not, so, much, from, outside, as, from, within, not, so, much, by, theory, and, instruction, as, rather, by, the, path, of, generation, plato, had, something, of, the, kind, in, mind, when, in, the, fifth, book, of, his, republic, he, explained, his, plan, for, increasing, and, improving, his, warrior, caste, if, we, could, castrate, all, scoundrels, and, stick, all, stupid, geese, in, a, convent, and, give, men, of, noble, character, a, whole, harem, and, procure, men, and, indeed, thorough, men, for, all, girls, of, intellect, and, understanding, then, a, generation, would, soon, arise, which, would, produce, a, better, age, than, that, of, pericles, in, another, context, schopenhauer, reiterated, his, eugenic, thesis, if, you, want, utopian, plans, i, would, say, the, only, solution, to, the, problem, is, the, despotism, of, the, wise, and, noble, members, of, a, genuine, aristocracy, a, genuine, nobility, achieved, by, mating, the, most, magnanimous, men, with, the, cleverest, and, most, gifted, women, this, proposal, constitutes, my, utopia, and, my, platonic, republic, analysts, e, g, keith, ansell, pearson, have, suggested, that, schopenhauer, s, anti, egalitarianist, sentiment, and, his, support, for, eugenics, influenced, the, neo, aristocratic, philosophy, of, friedrich, nietzsche, who, initially, considered, schopenhauer, his, mentor, as, a, consequence, of, his, monistic, philosophy, schopenhauer, was, very, concerned, about, animal, welfare, and, rights, for, him, all, individual, animals, including, humans, are, essentially, phenomenal, manifestations, of, the, one, underlying, will, for, him, the, word, will, designates, force, power, impulse, energy, and, desire, it, is, the, closest, word, we, have, that, can, signify, both, the, essence, of, all, external, things, and, our, own, direct, inner, experience, since, every, living, thing, possesses, will, humans, and, animals, are, fundamentally, the, same, and, can, recognize, themselves, in, each, other, for, this, reason, he, claimed, that, a, good, person, would, have, sympathy, for, animals, who, are, our, fellow, sufferers, compassion, for, animals, is, intimately, associated, with, goodness, of, character, and, it, may, be, confidently, asserted, that, he, who, is, cruel, to, living, creatures, cannot, be, a, good, man, nothing, leads, more, definitely, to, a, recognition, of, the, identity, of, the, essential, nature, in, animal, and, human, phenomena, than, a, study, of, zoology, and, anatomy, the, assumption, that, animals, are, without, rights, and, the, illusion, that, our, treatment, of, them, has, no, moral, significance, is, a, positively, outrageous, example, of, western, crudity, and, barbarity, universal, compassion, is, the, only, guarantee, of, morality, in, 1841, he, praised, the, establishment, in, london, of, the, society, for, the, prevention, of, cruelty, to, animals, and, in, philadelphia, of, the, animals, friends, society, schopenhauer, went, so, far, as, to, protest, using, the, pronoun, it, in, reference, to, animals, because, that, led, to, treatment, of, them, as, though, they, were, inanimate, things, to, reinforce, his, points, schopenhauer, referred, to, anecdotal, reports, of, the, look, in, the, eyes, of, a, monkey, who, had, been, shot, and, also, the, grief, of, a, baby, elephant, whose, mother, had, been, killed, by, a, hunter, schopenhauer, was, very, attached, to, his, succession, of, pet, poodles, he, criticized, spinoza, s, belief, that, animals, are, a, mere, means, for, the, satisfaction, of, humans, tim, madigan, wrote, that, despite, all, of, his, bombast, schopenhauer, was, a, sympathetic, character, who, had, concerns, for, the, suffering, of, animals, the, greatest, benefit, conferred, by, the, railways, is, that, they, spare, millions, of, draught, horses, their, miserable, existences, schopenhauer, read, the, latin, translation, of, the, ancient, hindu, texts, the, upanishads, translated, by, french, writer, anquetil, du, perron, from, the, persian, translation, of, prince, dara, shukoh, entitled, sirre, akbar, the, great, secret, he, was, so, impressed, by, its, philosophy, that, he, called, it, the, production, of, the, highest, human, wisdom, and, believed, it, contained, superhuman, concepts, schopenhauer, considered, india, as, the, land, of, the, most, ancient, and, most, pristine, wisdom, the, place, from, which, europeans, could, trace, their, descent, and, the, tradition, by, which, they, had, been, influenced, in, so, many, decisive, ways, and, regarded, the, upanishads, as, the, most, profitable, and, elevating, reading, which, is, possible, in, the, world, it, has, been, the, solace, of, my, life, and, will, be, the, solace, of, my, death, schopenhauer, was, first, introduced, to, anquetil, du, perron, s, translation, by, friedrich, majer, in, 1814, they, met, during, the, winter, of, 1813, 1814, in, weimar, at, the, home, of, schopenhauer, s, mother, according, to, the, biographer, safranski, majer, was, a, follower, of, herder, and, an, early, indologist, schopenhauer, did, not, begin, serious, study, of, the, indic, texts, until, the, summer, of, 1814, safranski, maintains, that, between, 1815, and, 1817, schopenhauer, had, another, important, cross, pollination, with, indian, thought, in, dresden, this, was, through, his, neighbor, of, two, years, karl, christian, friedrich, krause, krause, was, then, a, minor, and, rather, unorthodox, philosopher, who, attempted, to, mix, his, own, ideas, with, ancient, indian, wisdom, krause, had, also, mastered, sanskrit, unlike, schopenhauer, and, they, developed, a, professional, relationship, it, was, from, krause, that, schopenhauer, learned, meditation, and, received, the, closest, thing, to, expert, advice, concerning, indian, thought, the, view, of, things, that, all, plurality, is, only, apparent, that, in, the, endless, series, of, individuals, passing, simultaneously, and, successively, into, and, out, of, life, generation, after, generation, age, after, age, there, is, but, one, and, the, same, entity, really, existing, which, is, present, and, identical, in, all, alike, this, theory, i, say, was, of, course, known, long, before, kant, indeed, it, may, be, carried, back, to, the, remotest, antiquity, it, is, the, alpha, and, omega, of, the, oldest, book, in, the, world, the, sacred, vedas, whose, dogmatic, part, or, rather, esoteric, teaching, is, found, in, the, upanishads, there, in, almost, every, page, this, profound, doctrine, lies, enshrined, with, tireless, repetition, in, countless, adaptations, by, many, varied, parables, and, similes, it, is, expounded, and, inculcated, for, schopenhauer, will, had, ontological, primacy, over, the, intellect, desire, is, prior, to, thought, schopenhauer, felt, this, was, similar, to, notions, of, puru, rtha, or, goals, of, life, in, ved, nta, hinduism, in, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, denial, of, the, will, is, attained, by, the, book, oupnekhat, upanishad, always, lay, open, on, his, table, and, he, invariably, studied, it, before, going, to, bed, he, called, the, opening, up, of, sanskrit, literature, the, greatest, gift, of, our, century, and, predicted, that, the, philosophy, and, knowledge, of, the, upanishads, would, become, the, cherished, faith, of, the, west, most, noticeable, in, the, case, of, schopenhauer, s, work, was, the, significance, of, the, chandogya, upanishad, whose, mah, v, kya, tat, tvam, asi, is, mentioned, throughout, the, world, as, will, and, representation, schopenhauer, noted, a, correspondence, between, his, doctrines, and, the, four, noble, truths, of, buddhism, similarities, centered, on, the, principles, that, life, involves, suffering, that, suffering, is, caused, by, desire, ta, h, and, that, the, extinction, of, desire, leads, to, liberation, thus, three, of, the, four, truths, of, the, buddha, correspond, to, schopenhauer, s, doctrine, of, the, will, in, buddhism, while, greed, and, lust, are, always, unskillful, desire, is, ethically, variable, it, can, be, skillful, unskillful, or, neutral, buddhist, nirv, a, is, not, equivalent, to, the, condition, that, schopenhauer, described, as, denial, of, the, will, nirv, a, is, not, the, extinguishing, of, the, person, as, some, western, scholars, have, thought, but, only, the, extinguishing, the, literal, meaning, of, nirvana, of, the, flames, of, greed, hatred, and, delusion, that, assail, a, person, s, character, schopenhauer, made, the, following, statement, in, his, discussion, of, religions, if, i, wished, to, take, the, results, of, my, philosophy, as, the, standard, of, truth, i, should, have, to, concede, to, buddhism, pre, eminence, over, the, others, in, any, case, it, must, be, a, pleasure, to, me, to, see, my, doctrine, in, such, close, agreement, with, a, religion, that, the, majority, of, men, on, earth, hold, as, their, own, for, this, numbers, far, more, followers, than, any, other, and, this, agreement, must, be, yet, the, more, pleasing, to, me, inasmuch, as, in, my, philosophizing, i, have, certainly, not, been, under, its, influence, for, up, till, 1818, when, my, work, appeared, there, was, to, be, found, in, europe, only, a, very, few, accounts, of, buddhism, buddhist, philosopher, keiji, nishitani, sought, to, distance, buddhism, from, schopenhauer, while, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, may, sound, rather, mystical, in, such, a, summary, his, methodology, was, resolutely, empirical, rather, than, speculative, or, transcendental, philosophy, is, a, science, and, as, such, has, no, articles, of, faith, accordingly, in, it, nothing, can, be, assumed, as, existing, except, what, is, either, positively, given, empirically, or, demonstrated, through, indubitable, conclusions, also, note, this, actual, world, of, what, is, knowable, in, which, we, are, and, which, is, in, us, remains, both, the, material, and, the, limit, of, our, consideration, the, argument, that, buddhism, affected, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, more, than, any, other, dharmic, faith, loses, credence, since, he, did, not, begin, a, serious, study, of, buddhism, until, after, the, publication, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, in, 1818, scholars, have, started, to, revise, earlier, views, about, schopenhauer, s, discovery, of, buddhism, proof, of, early, interest, and, influence, appears, in, schopenhauer, s, 1815, 16, notes, transcribed, and, translated, by, urs, app, about, buddhism, they, are, included, in, a, recent, case, study, that, traces, schopenhauer, s, interest, in, buddhism, and, documents, its, influence, other, scholarly, work, questions, how, similar, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, actually, is, to, buddhism, some, traditions, in, western, esotericism, and, parapsychology, interested, schopenhauer, and, influenced, his, philosophical, theories, he, praised, animal, magnetism, as, evidence, for, the, reality, of, magic, in, his, on, the, will, in, nature, and, went, so, far, as, to, accept, the, division, of, magic, into, left, hand, and, right, hand, magic, although, he, doubted, the, existence, of, demons, schopenhauer, grounded, magic, in, the, will, and, claimed, all, forms, of, magical, transformation, depended, on, the, human, will, not, on, ritual, this, theory, notably, parallels, aleister, crowley, s, system, of, magic, and, its, emphasis, on, human, will, given, the, importance, of, the, will, to, schopenhauer, s, overarching, system, this, amounts, to, suggesting, his, whole, philosophical, system, had, magical, powers, schopenhauer, rejected, the, theory, of, disenchantment, and, claimed, philosophy, should, synthesize, itself, with, magic, which, he, believed, amount, to, practical, metaphysics, neoplatonism, including, the, traditions, of, plotinus, and, to, a, lesser, extent, marsilio, ficino, has, also, been, cited, as, an, influence, on, schopenhauer, schopenhauer, had, a, wide, range, of, interests, from, science, and, opera, to, occultism, and, literature, in, his, student, years, schopenhauer, went, more, often, to, lectures, in, the, sciences, than, philosophy, he, kept, a, strong, interest, as, his, personal, library, contained, near, to, 200, books, of, scientific, literature, at, his, death, and, his, works, refer, to, scientific, titles, not, found, in, the, library, 170, many, evenings, were, spent, in, the, theatre, opera, and, ballet, schopenhauer, especially, liked, the, operas, of, mozart, rossini, and, bellini, schopenhauer, considered, music, the, highest, art, and, played, the, flute, during, his, whole, life, 30, as, a, polyglot, he, knew, german, italian, spanish, french, english, latin, and, ancient, greek, and, was, an, avid, reader, of, poetry, and, literature, he, particularly, revered, goethe, petrarch, calder, n, and, shakespeare, if, goethe, had, not, been, sent, into, the, world, simultaneously, with, kant, in, order, to, counterbalance, him, so, to, speak, in, the, spirit, of, the, age, the, latter, would, have, been, haunted, like, a, nightmare, many, an, aspiring, mind, and, would, have, oppressed, it, with, great, affliction, but, now, the, two, have, an, infinitely, wholesome, effect, from, opposite, directions, and, will, probably, raise, the, german, spirit, to, a, height, surpassing, even, that, of, antiquity, 240, in, philosophy, his, most, important, influences, were, according, to, himself, kant, plato, and, the, upanishads, concerning, the, upanishads, and, vedas, he, writes, in, the, world, as, will, and, representation, if, the, reader, has, also, received, the, benefit, of, the, vedas, the, access, to, which, by, means, of, the, upanishads, is, in, my, eyes, the, greatest, privilege, which, this, still, young, century, 1818, may, claim, before, all, previous, centuries, if, then, the, reader, i, say, has, received, his, initiation, in, primeval, indian, wisdom, and, received, it, with, an, open, heart, he, will, be, prepared, in, the, very, best, way, for, hearing, what, i, have, to, tell, him, it, will, not, sound, to, him, strange, as, to, many, others, much, less, disagreeable, for, i, might, if, it, did, not, sound, conceited, contend, that, every, one, of, the, detached, statements, which, constitute, the, upanishads, may, be, deduced, as, a, necessary, result, from, the, fundamental, thoughts, which, i, have, to, enunciate, though, those, deductions, themselves, are, by, no, means, to, be, found, there, schopenhauer, saw, bruno, and, spinoza, as, philosophers, not, bound, to, their, age, or, nation, both, were, fulfilled, by, the, thought, that, as, manifold, the, appearances, of, the, world, may, be, it, is, still, one, being, that, appears, in, all, of, them, consequently, there, is, no, place, for, god, as, creator, of, the, world, in, their, philosophy, but, god, is, the, world, itself, schopenhauer, expressed, regret, that, spinoza, stuck, for, the, presentation, of, his, philosophy, with, the, concepts, of, scholasticism, and, cartesian, philosophy, and, tried, to, use, geometrical, proofs, that, do, not, hold, because, of, vague, and, overly, broad, definitions, bruno, on, the, other, hand, who, knew, much, about, nature, and, ancient, literature, presented, his, ideas, with, italian, vividness, and, is, amongst, philosophers, the, only, one, who, comes, near, plato, s, poetic, and, dramatic, power, of, exposition, schopenhauer, noted, that, their, philosophies, do, not, provide, any, ethics, and, it, is, therefore, very, remarkable, that, spinoza, called, his, main, work, ethics, in, fact, it, could, be, considered, complete, from, the, standpoint, of, life, affirmation, if, one, completely, ignores, morality, and, self, denial, it, is, yet, even, more, remarkable, that, schopenhauer, mentions, spinoza, as, an, example, of, the, denial, of, the, will, if, one, uses, the, french, biography, by, jean, maximilien, lucas, as, the, key, to, tractatus, de, intellectus, emendatione, the, importance, of, kant, for, schopenhauer, in, philosophy, as, well, as, on, a, personal, level, cannot, be, overstated, kant, s, philosophy, was, the, foundation, of, schopenhauer, s, and, he, had, high, praise, for, the, transcendental, aesthetic, section, of, kant, s, critique, of, pure, reason, schopenhauer, maintained, that, kant, stands, in, the, same, relation, to, philosophers, such, as, berkeley, and, plato, as, copernicus, to, hicetas, philolaus, and, aristarchus, kant, succeeded, in, demonstrating, what, previous, philosophers, merely, asserted, schopenhauer, writes, about, kant, s, influence, on, his, work, in, the, preface, to, the, second, edition, of, the, world, as, will, and, representation, i, have, already, explained, in, the, preface, to, the, first, edition, that, my, philosophy, is, founded, on, that, of, kant, and, therefore, presupposes, a, thorough, knowledge, of, it, i, repeat, this, here, for, kant, s, teaching, produces, in, the, mind, of, everyone, who, has, comprehended, it, a, fundamental, change, which, is, so, great, that, it, may, be, regarded, as, an, intellectual, new, birth, it, alone, is, able, really, to, remove, the, inborn, realism, which, proceeds, from, the, original, character, of, the, intellect, which, neither, berkeley, nor, malebranche, succeed, in, doing, for, they, remain, too, much, in, the, universal, while, kant, goes, into, the, particular, and, indeed, in, a, way, that, is, quite, unexampled, both, before, and, after, him, and, which, has, quite, a, peculiar, and, we, might, say, immediate, effect, upon, the, mind, in, consequence, of, which, it, undergoes, a, complete, undeception, and, forthwith, looks, at, all, things, in, another, light, only, in, this, way, can, any, one, become, susceptible, to, the, more, positive, expositions, which, i, have, to, give, on, the, other, hand, he, who, has, not, mastered, the, kantian, philosophy, whatever, else, he, may, have, studied, is, as, it, were, in, a, state, of, innocence, that, is, to, say, he, remains, in, the, grasp, of, that, natural, and, childish, realism, in, which, we, are, all, born, and, which, fits, us, for, everything, possible, with, the, single, exception, of, philosophy, in, his, study, room, one, bust, was, of, buddha, the, other, was, of, kant, the, bond, which, schopenhauer, felt, with, the, philosopher, of, k, nigsberg, is, demonstrated, in, an, unfinished, poem, he, dedicated, to, kant, included, in, volume, 2, of, the, parerga, with, my, eyes, i, followed, thee, into, the, blue, sky, and, there, thy, flight, dissolved, from, view, alone, i, stayed, in, the, crowd, below, thy, word, and, thy, book, my, only, solace, through, the, strains, of, thy, inspiring, words, i, sought, to, dispel, the, dreary, solitude, strangers, on, all, sides, surround, me, the, world, is, desolate, and, life, interminable, schopenhauer, dedicated, one, fifth, of, his, main, work, the, world, as, will, and, representation, to, a, detailed, criticism, of, the, kantian, philosophy, schopenhauer, praised, kant, for, his, distinction, between, appearance, and, the, thing, in, itself, whereas, the, general, consensus, in, german, idealism, was, that, this, was, the, weakest, spot, of, kant, s, theory, since, according, to, kant, causality, can, find, application, on, objects, of, experience, only, and, consequently, things, in, themselves, cannot, be, the, cause, of, appearances, the, inadmissibility, of, this, reasoning, was, also, acknowledged, by, schopenhauer, he, insisted, that, this, was, a, true, conclusion, drawn, from, false, premises, the, leading, figures, of, post, kantian, philosophy, johann, gottlieb, fichte, f, w, j, schelling, and, g, w, f, hegel, were, not, respected, by, schopenhauer, he, argued, that, they, were, not, philosophers, at, all, for, they, lacked, the, first, requirement, of, a, philosopher, namely, a, seriousness, and, honesty, of, inquiry, rather, they, were, merely, sophists, who, excelling, in, the, art, of, beguiling, the, public, pursued, their, own, selfish, interests, such, as, professional, advancement, within, the, university, system, diatribes, against, the, alleged, vacuity, dishonesty, pomposity, and, self, interest, of, these, contemporaries, are, to, be, found, throughout, schopenhauer, s, published, writings, the, following, passage, is, an, example, all, this, explains, the, painful, impression, with, which, we, are, seized, when, after, studying, genuine, thinkers, we, come, to, the, writings, of, fichte, and, schelling, or, even, to, the, presumptuously, scribbled, nonsense, of, hegel, produced, as, it, was, with, a, boundless, though, justified, confidence, in, german, stupidity, with, those, genuine, thinkers, one, always, found, an, honest, investigation, of, truth, and, just, as, honest, an, attempt, to, communicate, their, ideas, to, others, therefore, whoever, reads, kant, locke, hume, malebranche, spinoza, and, descartes, feels, elevated, and, agreeably, impressed, this, is, produced, through, communion, with, a, noble, mind, which, has, and, awakens, ideas, and, which, thinks, and, sets, one, thinking, the, reverse, of, all, this, takes, place, when, we, read, the, above, mentioned, three, german, sophists, an, unbiased, reader, opening, one, of, their, books, and, then, asking, himself, whether, this, is, the, tone, of, a, thinker, wanting, to, instruct, or, that, of, a, charlatan, wanting, to, impress, cannot, be, five, minutes, in, any, doubt, here, everything, breathes, so, much, of, dishonesty, schopenhauer, deemed, schelling, the, most, talented, of, the, three, and, wrote, that, he, would, recommend, his, elucidatory, paraphrase, of, the, highly, important, doctrine, of, kant, concerning, the, intelligible, character, if, he, had, been, honest, enough, to, admit, he, was, parroting, kant, instead, of, hiding, this, relation, in, a, cunning, manner, schopenhauer, reserved, his, most, unqualified, damning, condemnation, for, hegel, whom, he, considered, less, worthy, than, fichte, or, schelling, whereas, fichte, was, merely, a, windbag, windbeutel, hegel, was, a, commonplace, inane, loathsome, repulsive, and, ignorant, charlatan, the, philosophers, karl, popper, and, mario, bunge, agreed, with, this, distinction, hegel, schopenhauer, wrote, in, the, preface, to, his, two, fundamental, problems, of, ethics, not, only, performed, no, service, to, philosophy, but, he, has, had, a, detrimental, influence, on, philosophy, and, thereby, on, german, literature, in, general, really, a, downright, stupefying, or, we, could, even, say, a, pestilential, influence, which, it, is, therefore, the, duty, of, everyone, capable, of, thinking, for, himself, and, judging, for, himself, to, counteract, in, the, most, express, terms, at, every, opportunity, schopenhauer, remained, the, most, influential, german, philosopher, until, the, first, world, war, his, philosophy, was, a, starting, point, for, a, new, generation, of, philosophers, including, julius, bahnsen, paul, deussen, lazar, von, hellenbach, karl, robert, eduard, von, hartmann, ernst, otto, lindner, philipp, mainl, nder, friedrich, nietzsche, olga, pl, macher, and, agnes, taubert, his, legacy, shaped, the, intellectual, debate, and, forced, movements, that, were, utterly, opposed, to, him, neo, kantianism, and, positivism, to, address, issues, they, would, otherwise, have, completely, ignored, and, in, doing, so, he, changed, them, markedly, the, french, writer, maupassant, commented, that, to, day, even, those, who, execrate, him, seem, to, carry, in, their, own, souls, particles, of, his, thought, other, philosophers, of, the, 19th, century, who, cited, his, influence, include, hans, vaihinger, volkelt, solovyov, and, weininger, schopenhauer, was, well, read, by, physicists, most, notably, einstein, schr, dinger, wolfgang, pauli, and, majorana, einstein, described, schopenhauer, s, thoughts, as, a, continual, consolation, and, called, him, a, genius, in, his, berlin, study, three, figures, hung, on, the, wall, faraday, maxwell, schopenhauer, konrad, wachsmann, recalled, he, often, sat, with, one, of, the, well, worn, schopenhauer, volumes, and, as, he, sat, there, he, seemed, so, pleased, as, if, he, were, engaged, with, a, serene, and, cheerful, work, when, erwin, schr, dinger, discovered, schopenhauer, the, greatest, savant, of, the, west, he, considered, switching, his, study, of, physics, to, philosophy, he, maintained, the, idealistic, views, during, the, rest, of, his, life, wolfgang, pauli, accepted, the, main, tenet, of, schopenhauer, s, metaphysics, that, the, thing, in, itself, is, will, but, most, of, all, schopenhauer, is, famous, for, his, influence, on, artists, richard, wagner, became, one, of, the, earliest, and, most, famous, adherents, of, the, schopenhauerian, philosophy, the, admiration, was, not, mutual, and, schopenhauer, proclaimed, i, remain, faithful, to, rossini, and, mozart, so, he, has, been, nicknamed, the, artist, s, philosopher, see, also, influence, of, schopenhauer, on, tristan, und, isolde, under, the, influence, of, schopenhauer, leo, tolstoy, became, convinced, that, the, truth, of, all, religions, lies, in, self, renunciation, when, he, read, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, tolstoy, exclaimed, at, present, i, am, convinced, that, schopenhauer, is, the, greatest, genius, among, men, it, is, the, whole, world, in, an, incomparably, beautiful, and, clear, reflection, he, said, that, what, he, has, written, in, war, and, peace, is, also, said, by, schopenhauer, in, the, world, as, will, and, representation, jorge, luis, borges, remarked, that, the, reason, he, had, never, attempted, to, write, a, systematic, account, of, his, world, view, despite, his, penchant, for, philosophy, and, metaphysics, in, particular, was, because, schopenhauer, had, already, written, it, for, him, other, figures, in, literature, who, were, strongly, influenced, by, schopenhauer, were, thomas, mann, thomas, hardy, afanasy, fet, j, k, huysmans, and, george, santayana, in, herman, melville, s, final, years, while, he, wrote, billy, budd, he, read, schopenhauer, s, essays, and, marked, them, heavily, scholar, brian, yothers, notes, that, melville, marked, numerous, misanthropic, and, even, suicidal, remarks, suggesting, an, attraction, to, the, most, extreme, sorts, of, solitude, but, he, also, made, note, of, schopenhauer, s, reflection, on, the, moral, ambiguities, of, genius, schopenhauer, s, attraction, to, and, discussions, of, both, eastern, and, western, religions, in, conjunction, with, each, other, made, an, impression, on, melville, in, his, final, years, sergei, prokofiev, although, initially, reluctant, to, engage, with, works, noted, for, their, pessimism, became, fascinated, with, schopenhauer, after, reading, aphorisms, on, the, wisdom, of, life, in, parerga, and, paralipomena, with, his, truths, schopenhauer, gave, me, a, spiritual, world, and, an, awareness, of, happiness, friedrich, nietzsche, owed, the, awakening, of, his, philosophical, interest, to, reading, the, world, as, will, and, representation, and, admitted, that, he, was, one, of, the, few, philosophers, that, he, respected, dedicating, to, him, his, essay, schopenhauer, als, erzieher, one, of, his, untimely, meditations, early, in, his, career, ludwig, wittgenstein, adopted, schopenhauer, s, epistemological, idealism, and, some, traits, of, schopenhauer, s, influence, particularly, schopenhauerian, transcendentalism, can, be, observed, in, the, tractatus, logico, philosophicus, later, on, wittgenstein, rejected, epistemological, transcendental, idealism, for, gottlob, frege, s, conceptual, realism, in, later, years, wittgenstein, became, highly, dismissive, of, schopenhauer, describing, him, as, an, ultimately, shallow, thinker, his, friend, bertrand, russell, had, a, low, opinion, on, the, philosopher, and, even, came, to, attack, him, in, his, history, of, western, philosophy, for, hypocritically, praising, asceticism, yet, not, acting, upon, it, opposite, to, russell, on, the, foundations, of, mathematics, the, dutch, mathematician, l, e, j, brouwer, incorporated, kant, s, and, schopenhauer, s, ideas, in, the, philosophical, school, of, intuitionism, where, mathematics, is, considered, as, a, purely, mental, activity, instead, of, an, analytic, activity, wherein, objective, properties, of, reality, are, revealed, brouwer, was, also, influenced, by, schopenhauer, s, metaphysics, and, wrote, an, essay, on, mysticism, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, has, made, its, way, into, a, novel, the, schopenhauer, cure, by, american, existential, psychiatrist, and, emeritus, professor, of, psychiatry, irvin, yalom, schopenhauer, s, philosophy, and, the, discussions, on, philosophical, pessimism, it, has, engendered, has, been, the, focus, of, contemporary, thinkers, such, as, david, benatar, thomas, ligotti, and, eugene, thacker, their, work, also, served, as, an, inspiration, for, the, popular, hbo, tv, series, true, detective, as, well, as, life, is, beautiful, in, this, regard, schopenhauer, is, sometimes, considered, the, founding, father, of, today, s, antinatalism
