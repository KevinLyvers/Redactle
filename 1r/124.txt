remained, relatively, unknown, until, the, late, 1970s, when, her, work, was, rediscovered, by, art, historians, and, political, activists, by, the, early, 1990s, not, only, had, she, become, a, recognized, figure, in, art, history, but, she, was, also, regarded, as, an, icon, for, chicanos, the, feminism, movement, and, the, lgbtq, community, kahlo, s, work, has, been, celebrated, internationally, as, emblematic, of, mexican, national, and, indigenous, traditions, and, by, feminists, for, what, is, seen, as, its, uncompromising, depiction, of, the, female, experience, and, form, kahlo, enjoyed, art, from, an, early, age, receiving, drawing, instruction, from, printmaker, fernando, fern, ndez, who, was, her, father, s, friend, and, filling, notebooks, with, sketches, in,

by, her, talent, although, she, did, not, consider, art, as, a, career, at, this, time, a, severe, bus, accident, at, the, age, of, 18, left, kahlo, in, lifelong, pain, confined, to, bed, for, three, months, following, the, accident, kahlo, began, to, paint, she, started, to, consider, a, career, as, a, medical, illustrator, as, well, which, would, combine, her, interests, in, science, and, art, her, mother, provided, her, with, a, specially, made, easel, which, enabled, her, to, paint, in, bed, and, her, father, lent, her, some, of, his, oil, paints, she, had, a, mirror, placed, above, the, easel, so, that, she, could, see, herself, painting, became, a, way, for, kahlo, to, explore, questions, of, identity, and, existence, she, explained, i, paint, myself, because, i, am, often, alone, and, i, am, the, subject, i, know, best, she, later, stated, that, the, accident, and, the, isolating, recovery, period, made, her, desire, to, begin, again, painting, things, just, as, saw, them, with, own, eyes, and, nothing, more, most, of, the, paintings, kahlo, made, during, this, time, were, portraits, of, herself, her, sisters, and, her, schoolfriends, her, early, paintings, and, correspondence, show, that, she, drew, inspiration, especially, from, european, artists, in, particular, renaissance, masters, such, as, sandro, botticelli, and, bronzino, and, from, avant, garde, movements, such, as, neue, sachlichkeit, and, cubism, on, moving, to, morelos, in, 1929, with, her, husband, rivera, kahlo, was, inspired, by, the, city, of, cuernavaca, where, they, lived, she, changed, her, artistic, style, and, increasingly, drew, inspiration, from, mexican, folk, art, art, historian, andrea, kettenmann, states, that, she, may, have, been, influenced, by, adolfo, best, maugard, s, treatise, on, the, subject, for, she, incorporated, many, of, the, characteristics, that, he, outlined, for, example, the, lack, of, perspective, and, the, combining, of, elements, from, pre, columbian, and, colonial, periods, of, mexican, art, her, identification, with, la, raza, the, people, of, mexico, and, her, profound, interest, in, its, culture, remained, important, facets, of, her, art, throughout, the, rest, of, her, life, when, kahlo, and, rivera, moved, to, san, francisco, in, 1930, kahlo, was, introduced, to, american, artists, such, as, edward, weston, ralph, stackpole, timothy, l, pflueger, and, nickolas, muray, the, six, months, spent, in, san, francisco, were, a, productive, period, for, kahlo, who, further, developed, the, folk, art, style, she, had, adopted, in, cuernavaca, in, addition, to, painting, portraits, of, several, new, acquaintances, she, made, frieda, and, diego, rivera, 1931, a, double, portrait, based, on, their, wedding, photograph, and, the, portrait, of, luther, burbank, 1931, which, depicted, the, eponymous, horticulturist, as, a, hybrid, between, a, human, and, a, plant, although, she, still, publicly, presented, herself, as, simply, rivera, s, spouse, rather, than, as, an, artist, she, participated, for, the, first, time, in, an, exhibition, when, frieda, and, diego, rivera, was, included, in, the, sixth, annual, exhibition, of, the, san, francisco, society, of, women, artists, in, the, palace, of, the, legion, of, honor, on, moving, to, detroit, with, rivera, kahlo, experienced, numerous, health, problems, related, to, a, failed, pregnancy, despite, these, health, problems, as, well, as, her, dislike, for, the, capitalist, culture, of, the, united, states, kahlo, s, time, in, the, city, was, beneficial, for, her, artistic, expression, she, experimented, with, different, techniques, such, as, etching, and, frescos, and, her, paintings, began, to, show, a, stronger, narrative, style, she, also, began, placing, emphasis, on, the, themes, of, terror, suffering, wounds, and, pain, despite, the, popularity, of, the, mural, in, mexican, art, at, the, time, she, adopted, a, diametrically, opposed, medium, votive, images, or, retablos, religious, paintings, made, on, small, metal, sheets, by, amateur, artists, to, thank, saints, for, their, blessings, during, a, calamity, amongst, the, works, she, made, in, the, retablo, manner, in, detroit, are, henry, ford, hospital, 1932, my, birth, 1932, and, self, portrait, on, the, border, of, mexico, and, the, united, states, 1932, while, none, of, kahlo, s, works, were, featured, in, exhibitions, in, detroit, she, gave, an, interview, to, the, detroit, news, on, her, art, the, article, was, condescendingly, titled, wife, of, the, master, mural, painter, gleefully, dabbles, in, works, of, art, upon, returning, to, mexico, city, in, 1934, kahlo, made, no, new, paintings, and, only, two, in, the, following, year, due, to, health, complications, in, 1937, and, 1938, however, kahlo, s, artistic, career, was, extremely, productive, following, her, divorce, and, then, reconciliation, with, rivera, she, painted, more, than, she, had, done, in, all, her, eight, previous, years, of, marriage, creating, such, works, as, my, nurse, and, i, 1937, memory, the, heart, 1937, four, inhabitants, of, mexico, 1938, and, what, the, water, gave, me, 1938, although, she, was, still, unsure, about, her, work, the, national, autonomous, university, of, mexico, exhibited, some, of, her, paintings, in, early, 1938, she, made, her, first, significant, sale, in, the, summer, of, 1938, when, film, star, and, art, collector, edward, g, robinson, purchased, four, paintings, at, 200, each, even, greater, recognition, followed, when, french, surrealist, andr, breton, visited, rivera, in, april, 1938, he, was, impressed, by, kahlo, immediately, claiming, her, as, a, surrealist, and, describing, her, work, as, a, ribbon, around, a, bomb, he, not, only, promised, to, arrange, for, her, paintings, to, be, exhibited, in, paris, but, also, wrote, to, his, friend, and, art, dealer, julien, levy, who, invited, her, to, hold, her, first, solo, exhibition, at, his, gallery, on, the, east, 57th, street, in, manhattan, in, october, kahlo, traveled, alone, to, new, york, where, her, colorful, mexican, dress, caused, a, sensation, and, made, her, seen, as, the, height, of, exotica, the, exhibition, opening, in, november, was, attended, by, famous, figures, such, as, georgia, o, keeffe, and, clare, boothe, luce, and, received, much, positive, attention, in, the, press, although, many, critics, adopted, a, condescending, tone, in, their, reviews, for, example, time, wrote, that, little, frida, s, pictures, had, the, daintiness, of, miniatures, the, vivid, reds, and, yellows, of, mexican, tradition, and, the, playfully, bloody, fancy, of, an, unsentimental, child, despite, the, great, depression, kahlo, sold, half, of, the, 25, paintings, presented, in, the, exhibition, she, also, received, commissions, from, a, conger, goodyear, then, the, president, of, the, moma, and, clare, boothe, luce, for, whom, she, painted, a, portrait, of, luce, s, friend, socialite, dorothy, hale, who, had, committed, suicide, by, jumping, from, her, apartment, building, during, the, three, months, she, spent, in, new, york, kahlo, painted, very, little, instead, focusing, on, enjoying, the, city, to, the, extent, that, her, fragile, health, allowed, she, also, had, several, affairs, continuing, the, one, with, nickolas, muray, and, engaging, in, ones, with, levy, and, edgar, kaufmann, jr, in, january, 1939, kahlo, sailed, to, paris, to, follow, up, on, andr, breton, s, invitation, to, stage, an, exhibition, of, her, work, when, she, arrived, she, found, that, he, had, not, cleared, her, paintings, from, the, customs, and, no, longer, even, owned, a, gallery, with, the, aid, of, marcel, duchamp, she, was, able, to, arrange, for, an, exhibition, at, the, renou, et, colle, gallery, further, problems, arose, when, the, gallery, refused, to, show, all, but, two, of, kahlo, s, paintings, considering, them, too, shocking, for, audiences, and, breton, insisted, that, they, be, shown, alongside, photographs, by, manuel, alvarez, bravo, pre, columbian, sculptures, 18th, and, 19th, century, mexican, portraits, and, what, she, considered, junk, sugar, skulls, toys, and, other, items, he, had, bought, from, mexican, markets, the, exhibition, opened, in, march, but, received, much, less, attention, than, she, had, received, in, the, united, states, partly, due, to, the, looming, second, world, war, and, made, a, loss, financially, which, led, kahlo, to, cancel, a, planned, exhibition, in, london, regardless, the, louvre, purchased, the, frame, making, her, the, first, mexican, artist, to, be, featured, in, their, collection, she, was, also, warmly, received, by, other, parisian, artists, such, as, pablo, picasso, and, joan, mir, as, well, as, the, fashion, world, with, designer, elsa, schiaparelli, designing, a, dress, inspired, by, her, and, vogue, paris, featuring, her, on, its, pages, however, her, overall, opinion, of, paris, and, the, surrealists, remained, negative, in, a, letter, to, muray, she, called, them, this, bunch, of, coocoo, lunatics, and, very, stupid, surrealists, who, are, so, crazy, intellectual, and, rotten, that, i, can, t, even, stand, them, anymore, in, the, united, states, kahlo, s, paintings, continued, to, raise, interest, in, 1941, her, works, were, featured, at, the, institute, of, contemporary, art, in, boston, and, in, the, following, year, she, participated, in, two, high, profile, exhibitions, in, new, york, the, twentieth, century, portraits, exhibition, at, the, moma, and, the, surrealists, first, papers, of, surrealism, exhibition, in, 1943, she, was, included, in, the, mexican, art, today, exhibition, at, the, philadelphia, museum, of, art, and, women, artists, at, peggy, guggenheim, s, the, art, of, this, century, gallery, in, new, york, kahlo, gained, more, appreciation, for, her, art, in, mexico, as, well, she, became, a, founding, member, of, the, seminario, de, cultura, mexicana, a, group, of, twenty, five, artists, commissioned, by, the, ministry, of, public, education, in, 1942, to, spread, public, knowledge, of, mexican, culture, as, a, member, she, took, part, in, planning, exhibitions, and, attended, a, conference, on, art, in, mexico, city, her, paintings, were, featured, in, two, exhibitions, on, mexican, art, that, were, staged, at, the, english, language, benjamin, franklin, library, in, 1943, and, 1944, she, was, invited, to, participate, in, salon, de, la, flor, an, exhibition, presented, at, the, annual, flower, exposition, an, article, by, rivera, on, kahlo, s, art, was, also, published, in, the, journal, published, by, the, seminario, de, cultura, mexicana, in, 1943, kahlo, accepted, a, teaching, position, at, the, recently, reformed, nationalistic, escuela, nacional, de, pintura, escultura, y, grabado, la, esmeralda, she, encouraged, her, students, to, treat, her, in, an, informal, and, non, hierarchical, way, and, taught, them, to, appreciate, mexican, popular, culture, and, folk, art, and, to, derive, their, subjects, from, the, street, when, her, health, problems, made, it, difficult, for, her, to, commute, to, the, school, in, mexico, city, she, began, to, hold, her, lessons, at, la, casa, azul, four, of, her, students, fanny, rabel, arturo, garc, a, bustos, guillermo, monroy, and, arturo, estrada, became, devotees, and, were, referred, to, as, los, fridos, for, their, enthusiasm, kahlo, secured, three, mural, commissions, for, herself, and, her, students, kahlo, struggled, to, make, a, living, from, her, art, until, the, mid, to, late, 1940s, as, she, refused, to, adapt, her, style, to, suit, her, clients, wishes, she, received, two, commissions, from, the, mexican, government, in, the, early, 1940s, she, did, not, complete, the, first, one, possibly, due, to, her, dislike, of, the, subject, and, the, second, commission, was, rejected, by, the, commissioning, body, nevertheless, she, had, regular, private, clients, such, as, engineer, eduardo, morillo, safa, who, ordered, more, than, thirty, portraits, of, family, members, over, the, decade, her, financial, situation, improved, when, she, received, a, 5000, peso, national, prize, for, her, painting, moses, 1945, in, 1946, and, when, the, two, fridas, was, purchased, by, the, museo, de, arte, moderno, in, 1947, according, to, art, historian, andrea, kettenmann, by, the, mid, 1940s, her, paintings, were, featured, in, the, majority, of, group, exhibitions, in, mexico, further, martha, zamora, wrote, that, she, could, sell, whatever, she, was, currently, painting, sometimes, incomplete, pictures, were, purchased, right, off, the, easel, even, as, kahlo, was, gaining, recognition, in, mexico, her, health, was, declining, rapidly, and, an, attempted, surgery, to, support, her, spine, failed, her, paintings, from, this, period, include, broken, column, 1944, without, hope, 1945, tree, of, hope, stand, fast, 1946, and, the, wounded, deer, 1946, reflecting, her, poor, physical, state, during, her, last, years, kahlo, was, mostly, confined, to, the, casa, azul, she, painted, mostly, still, lifes, portraying, fruit, and, flowers, with, political, symbols, such, as, flags, or, doves, she, was, concerned, about, being, able, to, portray, her, political, convictions, stating, that, i, have, a, great, restlessness, about, my, paintings, mainly, because, i, want, to, make, it, useful, to, the, revolutionary, communist, movement, until, now, i, have, managed, simply, an, honest, expression, of, my, own, self, i, must, struggle, with, all, my, strength, to, ensure, that, the, little, positive, my, health, allows, me, to, do, also, benefits, the, revolution, the, only, real, reason, to, live, she, also, altered, her, painting, style, her, brushstrokes, previously, delicate, and, careful, were, now, hastier, her, use, of, color, more, brash, and, the, overall, style, more, intense, and, feverish, photographer, lola, alvarez, bravo, understood, that, kahlo, did, not, have, much, longer, to, live, and, thus, staged, her, first, solo, exhibition, in, mexico, at, the, galer, a, arte, contemporaneo, in, april, 1953, though, kahlo, was, initially, not, due, to, attend, the, opening, as, her, doctors, had, prescribed, bed, rest, for, her, she, ordered, her, four, poster, bed, to, be, moved, from, her, home, to, the, gallery, to, the, surprise, of, the, guests, she, arrived, in, an, ambulance, and, was, carried, on, a, stretcher, to, the, bed, where, she, stayed, for, the, duration, of, the, party, the, exhibition, was, a, notable, cultural, event, in, mexico, and, also, received, attention, in, mainstream, press, around, the, world, the, same, year, the, tate, gallery, s, exhibition, on, mexican, art, in, london, featured, five, of, her, paintings, in, 1954, kahlo, was, again, hospitalized, in, april, and, may, that, spring, she, resumed, painting, after, a, one, year, interval, her, last, paintings, include, the, political, marxism, will, give, health, to, the, sick, c, 1954, and, frida, and, stalin, c, 1954, and, the, still, life, viva, la, vida, 1954, estimates, vary, on, how, many, paintings, kahlo, made, during, her, life, with, figures, ranging, from, fewer, than, 150, to, around, 200, her, earliest, paintings, which, she, made, in, the, mid, 1920s, show, influence, from, renaissance, masters, and, european, avant, garde, artists, such, as, amedeo, modigliani, towards, the, end, of, the, decade, kahlo, derived, more, inspiration, from, mexican, folk, art, drawn, to, its, elements, of, fantasy, naivety, and, fascination, with, violence, and, death, the, style, she, developed, mixed, reality, with, surrealistic, elements, and, often, depicted, pain, and, death, one, of, kahlo, s, earliest, champions, was, surrealist, artist, andr, breton, who, claimed, her, as, part, of, the, movement, as, an, artist, who, had, supposedly, developed, her, style, in, total, ignorance, of, the, ideas, that, motivated, the, activities, of, my, friends, and, myself, this, was, echoed, by, bertram, d, wolfe, who, wrote, that, kahlo, s, was, a, sort, of, na, ve, surrealism, which, she, invented, for, herself, although, breton, regarded, her, as, mostly, a, feminine, force, within, the, surrealist, movement, kahlo, brought, postcolonial, questions, and, themes, to, the, forefront, of, her, brand, of, surrealism, breton, also, described, kahlo, s, work, as, wonderfully, situated, at, the, point, of, intersection, between, the, political, philosophical, line, and, the, artistic, line, while, she, subsequently, participated, in, surrealist, exhibitions, she, stated, that, she, detest, surrealism, which, to, her, was, bourgeois, art, and, not, true, art, that, the, people, hope, from, the, artist, some, art, historians, have, disagreed, whether, her, work, should, be, classified, as, belonging, to, the, movement, at, all, according, to, andrea, kettenmann, kahlo, was, a, symbolist, concerned, more, in, portraying, her, inner, experiences, emma, dexter, has, argued, that, as, kahlo, derived, her, mix, of, fantasy, and, reality, mainly, from, aztec, mythology, and, mexican, culture, instead, of, surrealism, it, is, more, appropriate, to, consider, her, paintings, as, having, more, in, common, with, magical, realism, also, known, as, new, objectivity, it, combined, reality, and, fantasy, and, employed, similar, style, to, kahlo, s, such, as, flattened, perspective, clearly, outlined, characters, and, bright, colours, similarly, to, many, other, contemporary, mexican, artists, kahlo, was, heavily, influenced, by, mexicanidad, a, romantic, nationalism, that, had, developed, in, the, aftermath, of, the, revolution, the, mexicanidad, movement, claimed, to, resist, the, mindset, of, cultural, inferiority, created, by, colonialism, and, placed, special, importance, on, indigenous, cultures, before, the, revolution, mexican, folk, culture, a, mixture, of, indigenous, and, european, elements, was, disparaged, by, the, elite, who, claimed, to, have, purely, european, ancestry, and, regarded, europe, as, the, definition, of, civilization, which, mexico, should, imitate, kahlo, s, artistic, ambition, was, to, paint, for, the, mexican, people, and, she, stated, that, she, wished, to, be, worthy, with, my, paintings, of, the, people, to, whom, i, belong, and, to, the, ideas, which, strengthen, me, to, enforce, this, image, she, preferred, to, conceal, the, education, she, had, received, in, art, from, her, father, and, ferdinand, fernandez, and, at, the, preparatory, school, instead, she, cultivated, an, image, of, herself, as, a, self, taught, and, naive, artist, when, kahlo, began, her, career, as, an, artist, in, the, 1920s, muralists, dominated, the, mexican, art, scene, they, created, large, public, pieces, in, the, vein, of, renaissance, masters, and, russian, socialist, realists, they, usually, depicted, masses, of, people, and, their, political, messages, were, easy, to, decipher, although, she, was, close, to, muralists, such, as, rivera, jos, clemente, orozco, and, david, alfaro, siquieros, and, shared, their, commitment, to, socialism, and, mexican, nationalism, the, majority, of, kahlo, s, paintings, were, self, portraits, of, relatively, small, size, particularly, in, the, 1930s, her, style, was, especially, indebted, to, votive, paintings, or, retablos, which, were, postcard, sized, religious, images, made, by, amateur, artists, their, purpose, was, to, thank, saints, for, their, protection, during, a, calamity, and, they, normally, depicted, an, event, such, as, an, illness, or, an, accident, from, which, its, commissioner, had, been, saved, the, focus, was, on, the, figures, depicted, and, they, seldom, featured, a, realistic, perspective, or, detailed, background, thus, distilling, the, event, to, its, essentials, kahlo, had, an, extensive, collection, of, approximately, 2, 000, retablos, which, she, displayed, on, the, walls, of, la, casa, azul, according, to, laura, mulvey, and, peter, wollen, the, retablo, format, enabled, kahlo, to, develop, the, limits, of, the, purely, iconic, and, allowed, her, to, use, narrative, and, allegory, many, of, kahlo, s, self, portraits, mimic, the, classic, bust, length, portraits, that, were, fashionable, during, the, colonial, era, but, they, subverted, the, format, by, depicting, their, subject, as, less, attractive, than, in, reality, she, concentrated, more, frequently, on, this, format, towards, the, end, of, the, 1930s, thus, reflecting, changes, in, mexican, society, increasingly, disillusioned, by, the, legacy, of, the, revolution, and, struggling, to, cope, with, the, effects, of, the, great, depression, mexicans, were, abandoning, the, ethos, of, socialism, for, individualism, this, was, reflected, by, the, personality, cults, which, developed, around, mexican, film, stars, such, as, dolores, del, r, o, according, to, schaefer, kahlo, s, mask, like, self, portraits, echo, the, contemporaneous, fascination, with, the, cinematic, close, up, of, feminine, beauty, as, well, as, the, mystique, of, female, otherness, expressed, in, film, noir, by, always, repeating, the, same, facial, features, kahlo, drew, from, the, depiction, of, goddesses, and, saints, in, indigenous, and, catholic, cultures, out, of, specific, mexican, folk, artists, kahlo, was, especially, influenced, by, hermenegildo, bustos, whose, works, portrayed, mexican, culture, and, peasant, life, and, jos, guadalupe, posada, who, depicted, accidents, and, crime, in, satiric, manner, she, also, derived, inspiration, from, the, works, of, hieronymus, bosch, whom, she, called, a, man, of, genius, and, pieter, bruegel, the, elder, whose, focus, on, peasant, life, was, similar, to, her, own, interest, in, the, mexican, people, another, influence, was, the, poet, rosario, castellanos, whose, poems, often, chronicle, a, woman, s, lot, in, the, patriarchal, mexican, society, a, concern, with, the, female, body, and, tell, stories, of, immense, physical, and, emotional, pain, kahlo, s, paintings, often, feature, root, imagery, with, roots, growing, out, of, her, body, to, tie, her, to, the, ground, this, reflects, in, a, positive, sense, the, theme, of, personal, growth, in, a, negative, sense, of, being, trapped, in, a, particular, place, time, and, situation, and, in, an, ambiguous, sense, of, how, memories, of, the, past, influence, the, present, for, good, and, or, ill, in, my, grandparents, and, i, kahlo, painted, herself, as, a, ten, year, old, holding, a, ribbon, that, grows, from, an, ancient, tree, that, bears, the, portraits, of, her, grandparents, and, other, ancestors, while, her, left, foot, is, a, tree, trunk, growing, out, of, the, ground, reflecting, kahlo, s, view, of, humanity, s, unity, with, the, earth, and, her, own, sense, of, unity, with, mexico, in, kahlo, s, paintings, trees, serve, as, symbols, of, hope, of, strength, and, of, a, continuity, that, transcends, generations, additionally, hair, features, as, a, symbol, of, growth, and, of, the, feminine, in, kahlo, s, paintings, and, in, self, portrait, with, cropped, hair, kahlo, painted, herself, wearing, a, man, s, suit, and, shorn, of, her, long, hair, which, she, had, just, cut, off, kahlo, holds, the, scissors, with, one, hand, menacingly, close, to, her, genitals, which, can, be, interpreted, as, a, threat, to, rivera, whose, frequent, unfaithfulness, infuriated, her, and, or, a, threat, to, harm, her, own, body, like, she, has, attacked, her, own, hair, a, sign, of, the, way, that, women, often, project, their, fury, against, others, onto, themselves, moreover, the, picture, reflects, kahlo, s, frustration, not, only, with, rivera, but, also, her, unease, with, the, patriarchal, values, of, mexico, as, the, scissors, symbolize, a, malevolent, sense, of, masculinity, that, threatens, to, cut, up, women, both, metaphorically, and, literally, in, mexico, the, traditional, spanish, values, of, machismo, were, widely, embraced, but, kahlo, was, always, uncomfortable, with, machismo, as, she, suffered, for, the, rest, of, her, life, from, the, bus, accident, in, her, youth, kahlo, spent, much, of, her, life, in, hospitals, and, undergoing, surgery, much, of, it, performed, by, quacks, who, kahlo, believed, could, restore, her, back, to, where, she, had, been, before, the, accident, many, of, kahlo, s, paintings, are, concerned, with, medical, imagery, which, is, presented, in, terms, of, pain, and, hurt, featuring, kahlo, bleeding, and, displaying, her, open, wounds, many, of, kahlo, s, medical, paintings, especially, dealing, with, childbirth, and, miscarriage, have, a, strong, sense, of, guilt, of, a, sense, of, living, one, s, life, at, the, expense, of, another, who, has, died, so, one, might, live, although, kahlo, featured, herself, and, events, from, her, life, in, her, paintings, they, were, often, ambiguous, in, meaning, she, did, not, use, them, only, to, show, her, subjective, experience, but, to, raise, questions, about, mexican, society, and, the, construction, of, identity, within, it, particularly, gender, race, and, social, class, historian, liza, bakewell, has, stated, that, kahlo, recognized, the, conflicts, brought, on, by, revolutionary, ideology, what, was, it, to, be, a, mexican, modern, yet, pre, columbian, young, yet, old, anti, catholic, yet, catholic, western, yet, new, world, developing, yet, underdeveloped, independent, yet, colonized, mestizo, yet, not, spanish, nor, indian, to, explore, these, questions, through, her, art, kahlo, developed, a, complex, iconography, extensively, employing, pre, columbian, and, christian, symbols, and, mythology, in, her, paintings, in, most, of, her, self, portraits, she, depicts, her, face, as, mask, like, but, surrounded, by, visual, cues, which, allow, the, viewer, to, decipher, deeper, meanings, for, it, aztec, mythology, features, heavily, in, kahlo, s, paintings, in, symbols, including, monkeys, skeletons, skulls, blood, and, hearts, often, these, symbols, referred, to, the, myths, of, coatlicue, quetzalcoatl, and, xolotl, other, central, elements, that, kahlo, derived, from, aztec, mythology, were, hybridity, and, dualism, many, of, her, paintings, depict, opposites, life, and, death, pre, modernity, and, modernity, mexican, and, european, male, and, female, in, addition, to, aztec, legends, kahlo, frequently, depicted, two, central, female, figures, from, mexican, folklore, in, her, paintings, la, llorona, and, la, malinche, as, interlinked, to, the, hard, situations, the, suffering, misfortune, or, judgement, as, being, calamitous, wretched, or, being, de, la, chingada, for, example, when, she, painted, herself, following, her, miscarriage, in, detroit, in, henry, ford, hospital, 1932, she, shows, herself, as, weeping, with, dishevelled, hair, and, an, exposed, heart, which, are, all, considered, part, of, the, appearance, of, la, llorona, a, woman, who, murdered, her, children, the, painting, was, traditionally, interpreted, as, simply, a, depiction, of, kahlo, s, grief, and, pain, over, her, failed, pregnancies, but, with, the, interpretation, of, the, symbols, in, the, painting, and, the, information, of, kahlo, s, actual, views, towards, motherhood, from, her, correspondence, the, painting, has, been, seen, as, depicting, the, unconventional, and, taboo, choice, of, a, woman, remaining, childless, in, mexican, society, kahlo, often, featured, her, own, body, in, her, paintings, presenting, it, in, varying, states, and, disguises, as, wounded, broken, as, a, child, or, clothed, in, different, outfits, such, as, the, tehuana, costume, a, man, s, suit, or, a, european, dress, she, used, her, body, as, a, metaphor, to, explore, questions, on, societal, roles, her, paintings, often, depicted, the, female, body, in, an, unconventional, manner, such, as, during, miscarriages, and, childbirth, or, cross, dressing, in, depicting, the, female, body, in, graphic, manner, kahlo, positioned, the, viewer, in, the, role, of, the, voyeur, making, it, virtually, impossible, for, a, viewer, not, to, assume, a, consciously, held, position, in, response, according, to, nancy, cooey, kahlo, made, herself, through, her, paintings, into, the, main, character, of, her, own, mythology, as, a, woman, as, a, mexican, and, as, a, suffering, person, she, knew, how, to, convert, each, into, a, symbol, or, sign, capable, of, expressing, the, enormous, spiritual, resistance, of, humanity, and, its, splendid, sexuality, similarly, nancy, deffebach, has, stated, that, kahlo, created, herself, as, a, subject, who, was, female, mexican, modern, and, powerful, and, who, diverged, from, the, usual, dichotomy, of, roles, of, mother, whore, allowed, to, women, in, mexican, society, due, to, her, gender, and, divergence, from, the, muralist, tradition, kahlo, s, paintings, were, treated, as, less, political, and, more, na, ve, and, subjective, than, those, of, her, male, counterparts, up, until, the, late, 1980s, according, to, art, historian, joan, borsa, the, critical, reception, of, her, exploration, of, subjectivity, and, personal, history, has, all, too, frequently, denied, or, de, emphasized, the, politics, involved, in, examining, one, s, own, location, inheritances, and, social, conditions, critical, responses, continue, to, gloss, over, kahlo, s, reworking, of, the, personal, ignoring, or, minimizing, her, interrogation, of, sexuality, sexual, difference, marginality, cultural, identity, female, subjectivity, politics, and, power, magdalena, carmen, frida, kahlo, y, calder, n, was, born, on, 6, july, 1907, in, coyoac, n, a, village, on, the, outskirts, of, mexico, city, kahlo, stated, that, she, was, born, at, the, family, home, la, casa, azul, the, blue, house, but, according, to, the, official, birth, registry, the, birth, took, place, at, the, nearby, home, of, her, maternal, grandmother, kahlo, s, parents, were, photographer, guillermo, kahlo, 1871, 1941, and, matilde, calder, n, y, gonz, lez, 1876, 1932, and, they, were, thirty, six, and, thirty, respectively, when, they, had, her, originally, from, germany, guillermo, had, immigrated, to, mexico, in, 1891, after, epilepsy, caused, by, an, accident, ended, his, university, studies, although, kahlo, said, her, father, was, jewish, and, her, paternal, grandparents, were, jews, from, the, city, of, arad, this, claim, was, challenged, in, 2006, by, a, pair, of, german, genealogists, who, found, he, was, instead, a, lutheran, matilde, was, born, in, oaxaca, to, an, indigenous, father, and, a, mother, of, spanish, descent, in, addition, to, kahlo, the, marriage, produced, daughters, matilde, c, 1898, 1951, adriana, c, 1902, 1968, and, cristina, c, 1908, 1964, she, had, two, half, sisters, from, guillermo, s, first, marriage, mar, a, luisa, and, margarita, but, they, were, raised, in, a, convent, kahlo, later, described, the, atmosphere, in, her, childhood, home, as, often, very, very, sad, both, parents, were, often, sick, and, their, marriage, was, devoid, of, love, her, relationship, with, her, mother, matilde, was, extremely, tense, kahlo, described, her, mother, as, kind, active, and, intelligent, but, also, calculating, cruel, and, fanatically, religious, her, father, guillermo, s, photography, business, suffered, greatly, during, the, mexican, revolution, as, the, overthrown, government, had, commissioned, works, from, him, and, the, long, civil, war, limited, the, number, of, private, clients, when, kahlo, was, six, years, old, she, contracted, polio, which, eventually, made, her, right, leg, grow, shorter, and, thinner, than, the, left, the, illness, forced, her, to, be, isolated, from, her, peers, for, months, and, she, was, bullied, while, the, experience, made, her, reclusive, it, made, her, guillermo, s, favorite, due, to, their, shared, experience, of, living, with, disability, kahlo, credited, him, for, making, her, childhood, marvelous, he, was, an, immense, example, to, me, of, tenderness, of, work, photographer, and, also, painter, and, above, all, in, understanding, for, all, my, problems, he, taught, her, about, literature, nature, and, philosophy, and, encouraged, her, to, play, sports, to, regain, her, strength, despite, the, fact, that, most, physical, exercise, was, seen, as, unsuitable, for, girls, he, also, taught, her, photography, and, she, began, to, help, him, retouch, develop, and, color, photographs, due, to, polio, kahlo, began, school, later, than, her, peers, along, with, her, younger, sister, cristina, she, attended, the, local, kindergarten, and, primary, school, in, coyoac, n, and, was, homeschooled, for, the, fifth, and, sixth, grades, while, cristina, followed, their, sisters, into, a, convent, school, kahlo, was, enrolled, in, a, german, school, due, to, their, father, s, wishes, she, was, soon, expelled, for, disobedience, and, was, sent, to, a, vocational, teachers, school, her, stay, at, the, school, was, brief, as, she, was, sexually, abused, by, a, female, teacher, in, 1922, kahlo, was, accepted, to, the, elite, national, preparatory, school, where, she, focused, on, natural, sciences, with, the, aim, of, becoming, a, physician, the, institution, had, only, recently, begun, admitting, women, with, only, 35, girls, out, of, 2, 000, students, she, performed, well, academically, was, a, voracious, reader, and, became, deeply, immersed, and, seriously, committed, to, mexican, culture, political, activism, and, issues, of, social, justice, the, school, promoted, indigenismo, a, new, sense, of, mexican, identity, that, took, pride, in, the, country, s, indigenous, heritage, and, sought, to, rid, itself, of, the, colonial, mindset, of, europe, as, superior, to, mexico, particularly, influential, to, kahlo, at, this, time, were, nine, of, her, schoolmates, with, whom, she, formed, an, informal, group, called, the, cachuchas, many, of, them, would, become, leading, figures, of, the, mexican, intellectual, elite, they, were, rebellious, and, against, everything, conservative, and, pulled, pranks, staged, plays, and, debated, philosophy, and, russian, classics, to, mask, the, fact, that, she, was, older, and, to, declare, herself, a, daughter, of, the, revolution, she, began, saying, that, she, had, been, born, on, 7, july, 1910, the, year, the, mexican, revolution, began, which, she, continued, throughout, her, life, she, fell, in, love, with, alejandro, gomez, arias, the, leader, of, the, group, and, her, first, love, her, parents, did, not, approve, of, the, relationship, arias, and, kahlo, were, often, separated, from, each, other, due, to, the, political, instability, and, violence, of, the, period, so, they, exchanged, passionate, love, letters, on, 17, september, 1925, kahlo, and, her, boyfriend, arias, were, on, their, way, home, from, school, they, boarded, one, bus, but, they, got, off, the, bus, to, look, for, an, umbrella, that, kahlo, had, left, behind, they, then, boarded, a, second, bus, which, was,

treatment, she, had, to, wear, a, plaster, corset, which, confined, her, to, bed, rest, for, the, better, part, of, three, months, the, accident, ended, kahlo, s, dreams, of, becoming, a, physician, and, caused, her, pain, and, illness, for, the, rest, of, her, life, her, friend, andr, s, henestrosa, stated, that, kahlo, lived, dying, kahlo, s, bed, rest, was, over, by, late, 1927, and, she, began, socializing, with, her, old, schoolfriends, who, were, now, at, university, and, involved, in, student, politics, she, joined, the, mexican, communist, party, pcm, and, was, introduced, to, a, circle, of, political, activists, and, artists, including, the, exiled, cuban, communist, julio, antonio, mella, and, the, italian, american, photographer, tina, modotti, at, one, of, modotti, s, parties, in, june, 1928, kahlo, was, introduced, to, diego, rivera, they, had, met, briefly, in, 1922, when, he, was, painting, a, mural, at, her, school, shortly, after, their, introduction, in, 1928, kahlo, asked, him, to, judge, whether, her, paintings, showed, enough, talent, for, her, to, pursue, a, career, as, an, artist, rivera, recalled, being, impressed, by, her, works, stating, that, they, showed, an, unusual, energy, of, expression, precise, delineation, of, character, and, true, severity, they, had, a, fundamental, plastic, honesty, and, an, artistic, personality, of, their, own, it, was, obvious, to, me, that, this, girl, was, an, authentic, artist, kahlo, soon, began, a, relationship, with, rivera, who, was, 21, years, her, senior, and, had, two, common, law, wives, kahlo, and, rivera, were, married, in, a, civil, ceremony, at, the, town, hall, of, coyoac, n, on, 21, august, 1929, her, mother, opposed, the, marriage, and, both, parents, referred, to, it, as, a, marriage, between, an, elephant, and, a, dove, referring, to, the, couple, s, differences, in, size, rivera, was, tall, and, overweight, while, kahlo, was, petite, and, fragile, regardless, her, father, approved, of, rivera, who, was, wealthy, and, therefore, able, to, support, kahlo, who, could, not, work, and, had, to, receive, expensive, medical, treatment, the, wedding, was, reported, by, the, mexican, and, international, press, and, the, marriage, was, subject, to, constant, media, attention, in, mexico, in, the, following, years, with, articles, referring, to, the, couple, as, simply, diego, and, frida, soon, after, the, marriage, in, late, 1929, kahlo, and, rivera, moved, to, cuernavaca, in, the, rural, state, of, morelos, where, he, had, been, commissioned, to, paint, murals, for, the, palace, of, cort, s, around, the, same, time, she, resigned, her, membership, of, the, pcm, in, support, of, rivera, who, had, been, expelled, shortly, before, the, marriage, for, his, support, of, the, leftist, opposition, movement, within, the, third, international, during, the, civil, war, morelos, had, seen, some, of, the, heaviest, fighting, and, life, in, the, spanish, style, city, of, cuernavaca, sharpened, kahlo, s, sense, of, a, mexican, identity, and, history, similar, to, many, other, mexican, women, artists, and, intellectuals, at, the, time, kahlo, began, wearing, traditional, indigenous, mexican, peasant, clothing, to, emphasize, her, mestiza, ancestry, long, and, colorful, skirts, huipils, and, rebozos, elaborate, headdresses, and, masses, of, jewelry, she, especially, favored, the, dress, of, women, from, the, allegedly, matriarchal, society, of, the, isthmus, of, tehuantepec, who, had, come, to, represent, an, authentic, and, indigenous, mexican, cultural, heritage, in, post, revolutionary, mexico, the, tehuana, outfit, allowed, kahlo, to, express, her, feminist, and, anti, colonialist, ideals, after, rivera, had, completed, the, commission, in, cuernavaca, in, late, 1930, he, and, kahlo, moved, to, san, francisco, where, he, painted, murals, for, the, luncheon, club, of, the, san, francisco, stock, exchange, and, the, california, school, of, fine, arts, the, couple, was, feted, lionized, spoiled, by, influential, collectors, and, clients, during, their, stay, in, the, city, her, long, love, affair, with, hungarian, american, photographer, nickolas, muray, most, likely, began, around, this, time, kahlo, and, rivera, returned, to, mexico, for, the, summer, of, 1931, and, in, the, fall, traveled, to, new, york, city, for, the, opening, of, rivera, s, retrospective, at, the, museum, of, modern, art, moma, in, april, 1932, they, headed, to, detroit, where, rivera, had, been, commissioned, to, paint, murals, for, the, detroit, institute, of, arts, by, this, time, kahlo, had, become, bolder, in, her, interactions, with, the, press, impressing, journalists, with, her, fluency, in, english, and, stating, on, her, arrival, to, the, city, that, she, was, the, greater, artist, of, the, two, of, them, of, course, he, does, well, for, a, little, boy, but, it, is, i, who, am, the, big, artist, the, year, spent, in, detroit, was, a, difficult, time, for, kahlo, although, she, had, enjoyed, visiting, san, francisco, and, new, york, city, she, disliked, aspects, of, american, society, which, she, regarded, as, colonialist, as, well, as, most, americans, whom, she, found, boring, she, disliked, having, to, socialize, with, capitalists, such, as, henry, and, edsel, ford, and, was, angered, that, many, of, the, hotels, in, detroit, refused, to, accept, jewish, guests, in, a, letter, to, a, friend, she, wrote, that, although, i, am, very, interested, in, all, the, industrial, and, mechanical, development, of, the, united, states, she, felt, a, bit, of, a, rage, against, all, the, rich, guys, here, since, i, have, seen, thousands, of, people, in, the, most, terrible, misery, without, anything, to, eat, and, with, no, place, to, sleep, that, is, what, has, most, impressed, me, here, it, is, terrifying, to, see, the, rich, having, parties, day, and, night, while, thousands, and, thousands, of, people, are, dying, of, hunger, kahlo, s, time, in, detroit, was, also, complicated, by, a, pregnancy, her, doctor, agreed, to, perform, an, abortion, but, the, medication, used, was, ineffective, kahlo, was, deeply, ambivalent, about, having, a, child, and, had, already, undergone, an, abortion, earlier, in, her, marriage, to, rivera, following, the, failed, abortion, she, reluctantly, agreed, to, continue, with, the, pregnancy, but, miscarried, in, july, which, caused, a, serious, hemorrhage, that, required, her, being, hospitalized, for, two, weeks, less, than, three, months, later, her, mother, died, from, complications, of, surgery, in, mexico, kahlo, and, rivera, returned, to, new, york, in, march, 1933, for, he, had, been, commissioned, to, paint, a, mural,

house, in, the, wealthy, neighborhood, of, san, ngel, commissioned, from, le, corbusier, s, student, juan, o, gorman, it, consisted, of, two, sections, joined, by, a, bridge, kahlo, s, was, painted, blue, and, rivera, s, pink, and, white, the, bohemian, residence, became, an, important, meeting, place, for, artists, and, political, activists, from, mexico, and, abroad, kahlo, once, again, experienced, health, problems, undergoing, an, appendectomy, two, abortions, and, the, amputation, of, gangrenous, toes, and, her, marriage, to, rivera, had, become, strained, he, was, not, happy, to, be, back, in, mexico, and, blamed, kahlo, for, their, return, while, he, had, been, unfaithful, to, her, before, he, now, embarked, on, an, affair, with, her, younger, sister, cristina, which, deeply, hurt, kahlo, s, feelings, after, discovering, the, affair, in, early, 1935, she, moved, to, an, apartment, in, central, mexico, city, and, considered, divorcing, him, she, also, had, an, affair, of,

commercial, property, complete, with, fan, clubs, and, merchandising, and, an, embodiment, of, the, hopes, and, aspirations, of, a, near, religious, group, of, followers, this, wild, hybrid, frida, a, mixture, of, tragic, bohemian, virgin, of, guadalupe, revolutionary, heroine, and, salma, hayek, has, taken, such, great, hold, on, the, public, imagination, that, it, tends, to, obscure, the, historically, retrievable, kahlo, art, historian, oriana, baddeley, on, kahlo, the, tate, modern, considers, kahlo, one, of, the, most, significant, artists, of, the, twentieth, century, art, historian, elizabeth, bakewell, has, stated, that, kahlo, is, one, of, mexico, s, most, important, twentieth, century, figures, kahlo, s, reputation, as, an, artist, developed, late, in, her, life, and, grew, even, further, posthumously, as, during, her, lifetime, she, was, primarily, known, as, the, wife, of, diego, rivera, and, as, an, eccentric, personality, among, the, international, cultural, elite, she, gradually, gained, more, recognition, in, the, late, 1970s, when, feminist, scholars, began, to, question, the, exclusion, of, female, and, non, western, artists, from, the, art, historical, canon, and, the, chicano, movement, lifted, her, as, one, of, their, icons, the, first, two, books, about, kahlo, were, published, in, mexico, by, teresa, del, conde, and, raquel, tibol, in, 1976, and, 1977, respectively, and, in, 1977, the, tree, of, hope, stands, firm, 1944, became, the, first, kahlo, painting, to, be, sold, in, an, auction, netting, 19, 000, at, sotheby, s, these, milestones, were, followed, by, the, first, two, retrospectives, staged, on, kahlo, s, oeuvre, in, 1978, one, at, the, palacio, de, bellas, artes, in, mexico, city, and, another, at, the, museum, of, contemporary, art, in, chicago, two, events, were, instrumental, in, raising, interest, in, her, life, and, art, for, the, general, public, outside, mexico, the, first, was, a, joint, retrospective, of, her, paintings, and, tina, modotti, s, photographs, at, the, whitechapel, gallery, in, london, which, was, curated, and, organized, by, peter, wollen, and, laura, mulvey, it, opened, in, may, 1982, and, later, traveled, to, sweden, germany, the, united, states, and, mexico, the, second, was, the, publication, of, art, historian, hayden, herrera, s, international, bestseller, frida, a, biography, of, frida, kahlo, in, 1983, by, 1984, kahlo, s, reputation, as, an, artist, had, grown, to, such, extent, that, mexico, declared, her, works, part, of, the, national, cultural, heritage, prohibiting, their, export, from, the, country, as, a, result, her, paintings, seldom, appear, in, international, auctions, and, comprehensive, retrospectives, are, rare, regardless, her, paintings, have, still, broken, records, for, latin, american, art, in, the, 1990s, and, 2000s, in, 1990, she, became, the, first, latin, american, artist, to, break, the, one, million, dollar, threshold, when, diego, and, i, was, auctioned, by, sotheby, s, for, 1, 430, 000, in, 2006, roots, 1943, reached, us, 5, 6, million, and, in, 2016, two, nudes, in, a, forest, 1939, sold, for, 8, million, kahlo, has, attracted, popular, interest, to, the, extent, that, the, term, fridamania, has, been, coined, to, describe, the, phenomenon, she, is, considered, one, of, the, most, instantly, recognizable, artists, whose, face, has, been, used, with, the, same, regularity, and, often, with, a, shared, symbolism, as, images, of, che, guevara, or, bob, marley, her, life, and, art, have, inspired, a, variety, of, merchandise, and, her, distinctive, look, has, been, appropriated, by, the, fashion, world, a, hollywood, biopic, julie, taymor, s, frida, was, released, in, 2002, based, on, herrera, s, biography, and, starring, salma, hayek, who, co, produced, the, film, as, kahlo, it, grossed, us, 56, million, worldwide, and, earned, six, academy, award, nominations, winning, for, best, makeup, and, best, original, score, the, 2017, disney, pixar, animation, coco, also, features, a, fictionalized, kahlo, as, a, supporting, character, voiced, by, natalia, cordova, buckley, kahlo, s, popular, appeal, is, seen, to, stem, first, and, foremost, from, a, fascination, with, her, life, story, especially, its, painful, and, tragic, aspects, she, has, become, an, icon, for, several, minority, groups, and, political, movements, such, as, feminists, the, lgbtq, community, and, chicanos, oriana, baddeley, has, written, that, kahlo, has, become, a, signifier, of, non, conformity, and, the, archetype, of, a, cultural, minority, who, is, regarded, simultaneously, as, a, victim, crippled, and, abused, and, as, a, survivor, who, fights, back, edward, sullivan, stated, that, kahlo, is, hailed, as, a, hero, by, so, many, because, she, is, someone, to, validate, their, own, struggle, to, find, their, own, voice, and, their, own, public, personalities, according, to, john, berger, kahlo, s, popularity, is, partly, due, to, the, fact, that, the, sharing, of, pain, is, one, of, the, essential, preconditions, for, a, refinding, of, dignity, and, hope, in, twenty, first, century, society, kirk, varnedoe, the, former, chief, curator, of, moma, has, stated, that, kahlo, s, posthumous, success, is, linked, to, the, way, in, which, she, clicks, with, today, s, sensibilities, her, psycho, obsessive, concern, with, herself, her, creation, of, a, personal, alternative, world, carries, a, voltage, her, constant, remaking, of, her, identity, her, construction, of, a, theater, of, the, self, are, exactly, what, preoccupy, such, contemporary, artists, as, cindy, sherman, or, kiki, smith, and, on, a, more, popular, level, madonna, she, fits, well, with, the, odd, androgynous, hormonal, chemistry, of, our, particular, epoch, kahlo, s, posthumous, popularity, and, the, commercialization, of, her, image, have, drawn, criticism, from, many, scholars, and, cultural, commenters, who, think, that, not, only, have, many, facets, of, her, life, been, mythologized, but, the, dramatic, aspects, of, her, biography, have, also, overshadowed, her, art, producing, a, simplistic, reading, of, her, works, in, which, they, are, reduced, to, literal, descriptions, of, events, in, her, life, according, to, journalist, stephanie, mencimer, kahlo, has, been, embraced, as, a, poster, child, for, every, possible, politically, correct, cause, and, like, a, game, of, telephone, the, more, kahlo, s, story, has, been, told, the, more, it, has, been, distorted, omitting, uncomfortable, details, that, show, her, to, be, a, far, more, complex, and, flawed, figure, than, the, movies, and, cookbooks, suggest, this, elevation, of, the, artist, over, the, art, diminishes, the, public, understanding, of, kahlo, s, place, in, history, and, overshadows, the, deeper, and, more, disturbing, truths, in, her, work, even, more, troubling, though, is, that, by, airbrushing, her, biography, kahlo, s, promoters, have, set, her, up, for, the, inevitable, fall, so, typical, of, women, artists, that, time, when, the, contrarians, will, band, together, and, take, sport, in, shooting, down, her, inflated, image, and, with, it, her, art, baddeley, has, compared, the, interest, in, kahlo, s, life, to, the, interest, in, the, troubled, life, of, vincent, van, gogh, but, has, also, stated, that, a, crucial, difference, between, the, two, is, that, most, people, associate, van, gogh, with, his, paintings, whereas, kahlo, is, usually, signified, by, an, image, of, herself, an, intriguing, commentary, on, the, way, male, and, female, artists, are, regarded, similarly, peter, wollen, has, compared, kahlo, s, cult, like, following, to, that, of, sylvia, plath, whose, unusually, complex, and, contradictory, art, has, been, overshadowed, by, simplified, focus, on, her, life, kahlo, s, legacy, has, been, commemorated, in, several, ways, la, casa, azul, her, home, in, coyoac, n, was, opened, as, a, museum, in, 1958, and, has, become, one, of, the, most, popular, museums, in, mexico, city, with, approximately, 25, 000, visitors, monthly, the, city, dedicated, a, park, parque,
