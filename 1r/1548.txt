journey, guevara, was, especially, impressed, by, the, camaraderie, among, the, people, living, in, a, leper, colony, stating, the, highest, forms, of, human, solidarity, and, loyalty, arise, among,

sharing, a, common, latino, heritage, was, a, theme, that, recurred, prominently, during, his, later, revolutionary, activities, upon, returning, to, argentina, he, completed, his, studies, and, received, his, medical, degree, in, june, 1953, guevara, later, remarked, that, through, his, travels, in, latin, america, he, came, in, close, contact, with, poverty, hunger, and, disease, along, with, the, inability, to, treat, a, child, because, of, lack, of, money, and, stupefaction, provoked, by, the, continual, hunger, and, punishment, that, leads, a, father, to, accept, the, loss, of, a, son, as, an, unimportant, accident, guevara, cited, these, experiences, as, convincing, him, that, to, help, these, people, he, needed, to, leave, the, realm, of, medicine, and, consider, the,

average, citizen, he, adopted, an, aggressive, tone, to, frighten, his, more, conservative, relatives, and, the, letter, ends, with, guevara, swearing, on, an, image, of, the, then, recently, deceased, joseph, stalin, not, to, rest, until, these, octopuses, have, been, vanquished, later, that, month, guevara, arrived, in, guatemala, where, president, jacobo, rbenz, headed, a,

enacted, a, major, land, reform, program, where, all, uncultivated, portions, of, large, land, holdings, were, to, be, appropriated, and, redistributed, to, landless, peasants, the, largest, land, owner, and, the, one, most, affected, by, the, reforms, was, the, united, fruit, company, from, which, the, rbenz, government, had, already, taken, more, than, 225, 000, acres, 91, 000, ha, of,

acquired, his, famous, nickname, due, to, his, frequent, use, of, the, argentine, filler, expression, che, a, multi, purpose, discourse, marker, like, the, syllable, eh, in, canadian, english, during, his, time, in, guatemala, guevara, was, hosted, by, other, central, american, exiles, one, of, whom, helena, leiva, de, holst, provided, him, with, food, and, lodging, discussed, her, travels, to,

forces, to, march, into, guatemala, city, and, establish, a, military, junta, which, elected, armas, as, president, on, 7, july, the, armas, regime, then, consolidated, power, by, rounding, up, and, executing, suspected, communists, while, crushing, the, previously, flourishing, labor, unions, and, reversing, the, previous, agrarian, reforms, guevara, was, eager, to, fight, on, behalf, of, rbenz, and, joined, an, armed, militia, organized, by, the, communist, youth, for, that, purpose, however, frustrated, with, that, group, s, inaction, guevara, soon, returned, to, medical, duties, following, the, coup, he, again, volunteered, to, fight, but, soon, after, rbenz, took, refuge, in, the, mexican, embassy, and, told, his, foreign, supporters, to, leave, the, country, guevara, s, repeated,

he, remained, until, he, received, a, safe, conduct, pass, some, weeks, later, and, made, his, way, to, mexico, the, overthrow, of, the, rbenz, government, and, establishment, of, the, right, wing, armas, dictatorship, cemented, guevara, s, view, of, the, united, states, as, an, imperialist, power, that, opposed, and, attempted, to, destroy, any, government, that, sought, to, redress, the, socioeconomic, inequality, endemic, to, latin, america, and, other, developing, countries, in, speaking, about, the, coup, guevara, stated, the, last, latin, american, revolutionary, democracy, that, of, jacobo, rbenz, failed, as, a, result, of, the, cold, premeditated, aggression, carried, out, by, the, united, states, its, visible, head, was, the, secretary, of, state, john, foster, dulles, a, man, who, through, a, rare, coincidence, was, also, a, stockholder, and, attorney, for, the, united, fruit, company, guevara, s, conviction, strengthened, that, marxism, achieved, through, armed, struggle, and, defended, by, an, armed, populace, was, the, only, way, to, rectify, such, conditions, gadea, wrote, later, it, was, guatemala, which, finally, convinced, him, of, the, necessity, for, armed, struggle, and, for, taking, the, initiative, against, imperialism, by, the, time, he, left, he, was, sure, of, this, guevara, arrived, in, mexico, city, on, 21, september, 1954, and, worked, in, the, allergy, section, of, the, general, hospital, and, at, the, hospital, infantil, de, mexico, in, addition, he, gave, lectures, on, medicine, at, the, faculty, of, medicine, in, the, national, autonomous, university, of, mexico, and, worked, as, a, news, photographer, for, latina, news, agency, his, first, wife, hilda, notes, in, her, memoir, my, life, with, che, that, for, a, while, guevara, considered, going, to, work, as, a, doctor, in, africa, and, that, he, continued, to, be, deeply, troubled, by, the, poverty, around, him, in, one, instance, hilda, describes, guevara, s, obsession, with, an, elderly, washerwoman, whom, he, was, treating, remarking, that, he, saw, her, as, representative, of, the, most, forgotten, and, exploited, class, hilda, later, found, a, poem, that, che, had, dedicated, to, the, old, woman, containing, a, promise, to, fight, for, a, better, world, for, a, better, life, for, all, the, poor, and, exploited, during, this, time, he, renewed, his, friendship, with, ico, l, pez, and, the, other, cuban, exiles, whom, he, had, met, in, guatemala, in, june, 1955, l, pez, introduced, him, to, ra, l, castro, who, subsequently, introduced, him, to, his, older, brother, fidel, castro, the, revolutionary, leader, who, had, formed, the, 26th, of, july, movement, and, was, now, plotting, to, overthrow, the, dictatorship, of, fulgencio, batista, during, a, long, conversation, with, fidel, on, the, night, of, their, first, meeting, guevara, concluded, that, the, cuban, s, cause, was, the, one, for, which, he, had, been, searching, and, before, daybreak, he, had, signed, up, as, a, member, of, 26, july, movement, despite, their, contrasting, personalities, from, this, point, on, che, and, fidel, began, to, foster, what, dual, biographer, simon, reid, henry, deemed, a, revolutionary, friendship, that, would, change, the, world, as, a, result, of, their, coinciding, commitment, to, anti, imperialism, by, this, point, in, guevara, s, life, he, deemed, that, us, controlled, conglomerates, installed, and, supported, repressive, regimes, around, the, world, in, this, vein, he, considered, batista, a, u, s, puppet, whose, strings, needed, cutting, although, he, planned, to, be, the, group, s, combat, medic, guevara, participated, in, the, military, training, with, the, members, of, the, movement, the, key, portion, of, training, involved, learning, hit, and, run, tactics, of, guerrilla, warfare, guevara, and, the, others, underwent, arduous, 15, hour, marches, over, mountains, across, rivers, and, through, the, dense, undergrowth, learning, and, perfecting, the, procedures, of, ambush, and, quick, retreat, from, the, start, guevara, was, instructor, alberto, bayo, s, prize, student, among, those, in, training, scoring, the, highest, on, all, of, the, tests, given, at, the, end, of, the, course, he, was, called, the, best, guerrilla, of, them, all, by, general, bayo, guevara, then, married, hilda, in, mexico, in, september, 1955, before, embarking, on, his, plan, to, assist, in, the, liberation, of, cuba, the, first, step, in, castro, s, revolutionary, plan, was, an, assault, on, cuba, from, mexico, via, the, granma, an, old, leaky, cabin, cruiser, they, set, out, for, cuba, on, 25, november, 1956, attacked, by, batista, s, military, soon, after, landing, many, of, the, 82, men, were, either, killed, in, the, attack, or, executed, upon, capture, only, 22, found, each, other, afterwards, during, this, initial, bloody, confrontation, guevara, laid, down, his, medical, supplies, and, picked, up, a, box, of, ammunition, dropped, by, a, fleeing, comrade, proving, to, be, a, symbolic, moment, in, che, s, life, only, a, small, band, of, revolutionaries, survived, to, re, group, as, a, bedraggled, fighting, force, deep, in, the, sierra, maestra, mountains, where, they, received, support, from, the, urban, guerrilla, network, of, frank, pa, s, 26, july, movement, and, local, campesinos, with, the, group, withdrawn, to, the, sierra, the, world, wondered, whether, castro, was, alive, or, dead, until, early, 1957, when, an, interview, by, herbert, matthews, appeared, in, the, new, york, times, the, article, presented, a, lasting, almost, mythical, image, for, castro, and, the, guerrillas, guevara, was, not, present, for, the, interview, but, in, the, coming, months, he, began, to, realize, the, importance, of, the, media, in, their, struggle, meanwhile, as, supplies, and, morale, diminished, and, with, an, allergy, to, mosquito, bites, which, resulted, in, agonizing, walnut, sized, cysts, on, his, body, guevara, considered, these, the, most, painful, days, of, the, war, during, guevara, s, time, living, hidden, among, the, poor, subsistence, farmers, of, the, sierra, maestra, mountains, he, discovered, that, there, were, no, schools, no, electricity, minimal, access, to, healthcare, and, more, than, 40, percent, of, the, adults, were, illiterate, as, the, war, continued, guevara, became, an, integral, part, of, the, rebel, army, and, convinced, castro, with, competence, diplomacy, and, patience, guevara, set, up, factories, to, make, grenades, built, ovens, to, bake, bread, and, organized, schools, to, teach, illiterate, campesinos, to, read, and, write, moreover, guevara, established, health, clinics, workshops, to, teach, military, tactics, and, a, newspaper, to, disseminate, information, the, man, whom, time, dubbed, three, years, later, castro, s, brain, at, this, point, was, promoted, by, fidel, castro, to, comandante, commander, of, a, second, army, column, as, second, in, command, guevara, was, a, harsh, disciplinarian, who, sometimes, shot, defectors, deserters, were, punished, as, traitors, and, guevara, was, known, to, send, squads, to, track, those, seeking, to, abandon, their, duties, as, a, result, guevara, became, feared, for, his, brutality, and, ruthlessness, during, the, guerrilla, campaign, guevara, was, also, responsible, for, the, summary, executions, of, a, number, of, men, accused, of, being, informers, deserters, or, spies, in, his, diaries, guevara, described, the, first, such, execution, of, eutimio, guerra, a, peasant, who, had, acted, as, a, guide, for, the, castrist, guerrillas, but, admitted, treason, when, it, was, discovered, he, accepted, the, promise, of, ten, thousand, pesos, for, repeatedly, giving, away, the, rebels, position, for, attack, by, the, cuban, air, force, such, information, also, allowed, batista, s, army, to, burn, the, homes, of, peasants, sympathetic, to, the, revolution, upon, guerra, s, request, that, they, end, his, life, quickly, che, stepped, forward, and, shot, him, in, the, head, writing, the, situation, was, uncomfortable, for, the, people, and, for, eutimio, so, i, ended, the, problem, giving, him, a, shot, with, a, 32, pistol, in, the, right, side, of, the, brain, with, exit, orifice, in, the, right, temporal, his, scientific, notations, and, matter, of, fact, description, suggested, to, one, biographer, a, remarkable, detachment, to, violence, by, that, point, in, the, war, later, guevara, published, a, literary, account, of, the, incident, titled, death, of, a, traitor, where, he, transfigured, eutimio, s, betrayal, and, pre, execution, request, that, the, revolution, take, care, of, his, children, into, a, revolutionary, parable, about, redemption, through, sacrifice, although, he, maintained, a, demanding, and, harsh, disposition, guevara, also, viewed, his, role, of, commander, as, one, of, a, teacher, entertaining, his, men, during, breaks, between, engagements, with, readings, from, the, likes, of, robert, louis, stevenson, miguel, de, cervantes, and, spanish, lyric, poets, together, with, this, role, and, inspired, by, jos, mart, s, principle, of, literacy, without, borders, guevara, further, ensured, that, his, rebel, fighters, made, daily, time, to, teach, the, uneducated, campesinos, with, whom, they, lived, and, fought, to, read, and, write, in, what, guevara, termed, the, battle, against, ignorance, tom, s, alba, who, fought, under, guevara, s, command, later, stated, that, che, was, loved, in, spite, of, being, stern, and, demanding, we, would, have, given, our, life, for, him, his, commanding, officer, fidel, castro, described, guevara, as, intelligent, daring, and, an, exemplary, leader, who, had, great, moral, authority, over, his, troops, castro, further, remarked, that, guevara, took, too, many, risks, even, having, a, tendency, toward, foolhardiness, guevara, s, teenage, lieutenant, joel, iglesias, recounts, such, actions, in, his, diary, noting, that, guevara, s, behavior, in, combat, even, brought, admiration, from, the, enemy, on, one, occasion, iglesias, recounts, the, time, he, had, been, wounded, in, battle, stating, che, ran, out, to, me, defying, the, bullets, threw, me, over, his, shoulder, and, got, me, out, of, there, the, guards, didn, t, dare, fire, at, him, later, they, told, me, he, made, a, great, impression, on, them, when, they, saw, him, run, out, with, his, pistol, stuck, in, his, belt, ignoring, the, danger, they, didn, t, dare, shoot, guevara, was, instrumental, in, creating, the, clandestine, radio, station, radio, rebelde, rebel, radio, in, february, 1958, which, broadcast, news, to, the, cuban, people, with, statements, by, 26, july, movement, and, provided, radiotelephone, communication, between, the, growing, number, of, rebel, columns, across, the, island, guevara, had, apparently, been, inspired, to, create, the, station, by, observing, the, effectiveness, of, cia, supplied, radio, in, guatemala, in, ousting, the, government, of, jacobo, rbenz, guzm, n, to, quell, the, rebellion, cuban, government, troops, began, executing, rebel, prisoners, on, the, spot, and, regularly, rounded, up, tortured, and, shot, civilians, as, a, tactic, of, intimidation, by, march, 1958, the, continued, atrocities, carried, out, by, batista, s, forces, led, the, united, states, to, stop, selling, arms, to, the, cuban, government, then, in, late, july, 1958, guevara, played, a, critical, role, in, the, battle, of, las, mercedes, by, using, his, column, to, halt, a, force, of, 1, 500, men, called, up, by, batista, s, general, cantillo, in, a, plan, to, encircle, and, destroy, castro, s, forces, years, later, major, larry, bockman, of, the, united, states, marine, corps, analyzed, and, described, che, s, tactical, appreciation, of, this, battle, as, brilliant, during, this, time, guevara, also, became, an, expert, at, leading, hit, and, run, tactics, against, batista, s, army, and, then, fading, back, into, the, countryside, before, the, army, could, counterattack, as, the, war, extended, guevara, led, a, new, column, of, fighters, dispatched, westward, for, the, final, push, towards, havana, travelling, by, foot, guevara, embarked, on, a, difficult, 7, week, march,

taking, las, villas, province, in, a, matter, of, days, he, executed, a, series, of, brilliant, tactical, victories, that, gave, him, control, of, all, but, the, province, s, capital, city, of, santa, clara, guevara, then, directed, his, suicide, squad, in, the, attack, on, santa, clara, which, became, the, final, decisive, military, victory, of, the, revolution, in, the, six, weeks, leading, up, to, the, battle, there, were, times, when, his, men, were, completely, surrounded, outgunned, and, overrun, che, s, eventual, victory, despite, being, outnumbered, 10, 1, remains, in, the, view, of, some, observers, a, remarkable, tour, de, force, in, modern, warfare, radio, rebelde, broadcast, the, first, reports, that, guevara, s, column, had, taken, santa, clara, on, new, year, s, eve, 1958, this, contradicted, reports, by, the, heavily, controlled, national, news, media, which, had, at, one, stage, reported, guevara, s, death, during, the, fighting, at, 3, am, on, 1, january, 1959, upon,

the, triumph, when, hilda, gadea, arrived, in, cuba, in, late, january, guevara, told, her, that, he, was, involved, with, another, woman, and, the, two, agreed, on, a, divorce, which, was, finalized,

of, the, revolution, in, 1959, the, revolutionary, government, extended, its, application, to, the, whole, of, the, republic, and, to, those, it, considered, war, criminals, captured, and, tried, after, the, revolution, according, to, the, cuban, ministry, of, justice, this, latter, extension, was, supported, by, the, majority, of, the, population, and, followed, the, same, procedure, as,

to, prevent, citizens, themselves, from, taking, justice, into, their, own, hands, as, had, happened, twenty, years, earlier, in, the, anti, machado, rebellion, biographers, note, that, in, january,

executions, at, la, caba, a, some, exiled, opposition, biographers, report, that, he, relished, the, rituals, of, the, firing, squad, and, organized, them, with, gusto, while, others, relate, that, guevara, pardoned, as, many, prisoners, as, he, could, all, sides, acknowledge, that, guevara, had, become, a, hardened, man, who, had, no, qualms, about, the, death, penalty, or, about, summary, and, collective, trials, if, the, only, way, to, defend, the, revolution, was, to, execute, its, enemies, he, would, not, be, swayed, by, humanitarian, or, political, arguments, in, a, 5, february, 1959, letter, to, luis, paredes, l, pez, in, buenos, aires, guevara, states, unequivocally, the, executions, by, firing, squads, are, not, only, a, necessity, for, the, people, of, cuba, but, also, an, imposition, of, the, people, along, with, ensuring, revolutionary, justice, the, other, key, early, platform, of, guevara, was, establishing, agrarian, land, reform, almost, immediately, after, the, success, of, the, revolution, on, 27, january, 1959, guevara, made, one, of, his, most, significant, speeches, where, he, talked, about, the, social, ideas, of, the, rebel, army, during, this, speech, he, declared, that, the, main, concern, of, the, new, cuban, government, was, the, social, justice, that, land, redistribution, brings, about, a, few, months, later, 17, may, 1959, the, agrarian, reform, law, crafted, by, guevara, went, into, effect, limiting, the, size, of, all, farms, to, 1, 000, acres, 400, ha, any, holdings, over, these, limits, were, expropriated, by, the, government, and, either, redistributed, to, peasants, in, 67, acre, 270, 000, m, 2, parcels, or, held, as, state, run, communes, the, law, also, stipulated, that, foreigners, could, not, own, cuban, sugar, plantations, on, 2, june, 1959, he, married, aleida, march, a, cuban, born, member, of, 26, july, movement, with, whom, he, had, been, living, since, late, 1958, guevara, returned, to, the, seaside, village, of, tarara, in, june, for, his, honeymoon, with, aleida, a, civil, ceremony, was, held, at, la, caba, a, military, fortress, in, total, guevara, would, have, five, children, from, his, two, marriages, on, 12, june, 1959, castro, sent, guevara, out, on, a, three, month, tour, of, mostly, bandung, pact, countries, morocco, sudan, egypt, syria, pakistan, india, sri, lanka, burma, thailand, indonesia, japan, yugoslavia, and, greece, and, the, cities, of, singapore, and, hong, kong, sending, guevara, away, from, havana, allowed, castro, to, appear, to, distance, himself, from, guevara, and, his, marxist, sympathies, which, troubled, both, the, united, states, and, some, of, the, members, of, castro, s, 26, july, movement, while, in, jakarta, guevara, visited, indonesian, president, sukarno, to, discuss, the, recent, revolution, of, 1945, 1949, in, indonesia, and, to, establish, trade, relations, between, their, two, countries, the, two, men, quickly, bonded, as, sukarno, was, attracted, to, guevara, s, energy, and, his, relaxed, informal, approach, moreover, they, shared, revolutionary, leftist, aspirations, against, western, imperialism, guevara, next, spent, 12, days, in, japan, 15, 27, july, participating, in, negotiations, aimed, at, expanding, cuba, s, trade, relations, with, that, country, during, the, visit, he, refused, to, visit, and, lay, a, wreath, at, japan, s, tomb, of, the, unknown, soldier, commemorating, soldiers, lost, during, world, war, ii, remarking, that, the, japanese, imperialists, had, killed, millions, of, asians, instead, guevara, stated, that, he, would, visit, hiroshima, where, the, american, military, had, detonated, an, atomic, bomb, 14, years, earlier, despite, his, denunciation, of, imperial, japan, guevara, considered, president, truman, a, macabre, clown, for, the, bombings, and, after, visiting, hiroshima, and, its, peace, memorial, museum, he, sent, back, a, postcard, to, cuba, stating, in, order, to, fight, better, for, peace, one, must, look, at, hiroshima, upon, guevara, s, return, to, cuba, in, september, 1959, it, became, evident, that, castro, now, had, more, political, power, the, government, had, begun, land, seizures, in, accordance, with, the, agrarian, reform, law, but, was, hedging, on, compensation, offers, to, landowners, instead, offering, low, interest, bonds, a, step, which, put, the, united, states, on, alert, at, this, point, the, affected, wealthy, cattlemen, of, camag, ey, mounted, a, campaign, against, the, land, redistributions, and, enlisted, the, newly, disaffected, rebel, leader, huber, matos, who, along, with, the, anti, communist, wing, of, the, 26, july, movement, joined, them, in, denouncing, communist, encroachment, during, this, time, dominican, dictator, rafael, trujillo, was, offering, assistance, to, the, anti, communist, legion, of, the, caribbean, which, was, training, in, the, dominican, republic, this, multi, national, force, composed, mostly, of, spaniards, and, cubans, but, also, of, croatians, germans, greeks, and, right, wing, mercenaries, was, plotting, to, topple, castro, s, new, regime, at, this, stage, guevara, acquired, the, additional, position, of, minister, of, finance, as, well, as, president, of, the, national, bank, these, appointments, combined, with, his, existing, position, as, minister, of, industries, placed, guevara, at, the, zenith, of, his, power, as, the, virtual, czar, of, the, cuban, economy, as, a, consequence, of, his, position, at, the, head, of, the, central, bank, it, became, guevara, s, duty, to, sign, the, cuban, currency, which, per, custom, bore, his, signature, instead, of, using, his, full, name, he, signed, the, bills, solely, che, it, was, through, this, symbolic, act, which, horrified, many, in, the, cuban, financial, sector, that, guevara, signaled, his, distaste, for, money, and, the, class, distinctions, it, brought, about, guevara, s, long, time, friend, ricardo, rojo, later, remarked, that, the, day, he, signed, che, on, the, bills, he, literally, knocked, the, props, from, under, the, widespread, belief, that, money, was, sacred, international, threats, were, heightened, when, on, 4, march, 1960, two, massive, explosions, ripped, through, the, french, freighter, la, coubre, which, was, carrying, belgian, munitions, from, the, port, of, antwerp, and, was, docked, in, havana, harbor, the, blasts, killed, at, least, 76, people, and, injured, several, hundred, with, guevara, personally, providing, first, aid, to, some, of, the, victims, fidel, castro, immediately, accused, the, cia, of, an, act, of, terrorism, and, held, a, state, funeral, the, following, day, for, the, victims, of, the, blast, at, the, memorial, service, alberto, korda, took, the, famous, photograph, of, guevara, now, known, as, guerrillero, heroico, perceived, threats, prompted, castro, to, eliminate, more, counter, revolutionaries, and, to, utilize, guevara, to, drastically, increase, the, speed, of, land, reform, to, implement, this, plan, a, new, government, agency, the, national, institute, of, agrarian, reform, inra, was, established, by, the, cuban, government, to, administer, the, new, agrarian, reform, law, inra, quickly, became, the, most, important, governing, body, in, the, nation, with, guevara, serving, as, its, head, in, his, capacity, as, minister, of, industries, under, guevara, s, command, inra, established, its, own, 100, 000, person, militia, used, first, to, help, the, government, seize, control, of, the, expropriated, land, and, supervise, its, distribution, and, later, to, set, up, cooperative, farms, the, land, confiscated, included, 480, 000, acres, 190, 000, ha, owned, by, united, states, corporations, months, later, in, retaliation, us, president, dwight, d, eisenhower, sharply, reduced, united, states, imports, of, cuban, sugar, cuba, s, main, cash, crop, which, led, guevara, on, 10, july, 1960, to, address, over, 100, 000, workers, in, front, of, the, presidential, palace, at, a, rally, to, denounce, the, economic, aggression, of, the, united, states, time, magazine, reporters, who, met, with, guevara, around, this, time, described, him, as, guid, ing, cuba, with, icy, calculation, vast, competence, high, intelligence, and, a, perceptive, sense, of, humor, guevara, was, like, a, father, to, me, he, educated, me, he, taught, me, to, think, he, taught, me, the, most, beautiful, thing, which, is, to, be, human, urbano, a, k, a, leonardo, tamayo, fought, with, guevara, in, cuba, and, bolivia, along, with, land, reform, guevara, stressed, the, need, for, national, improvement, in, literacy, before, 1959, the, official, literacy, rate, for, cuba, was, between, 60, and, 76, with, educational, access, in, rural, areas, and, a, lack, of, instructors, the, main, determining, factors, as, a, result, the, cuban, government, at, guevara, s, behest, dubbed, 1961, the, year, of, education, and, mobilized, over, 100, 000, volunteers, into, literacy, brigades, who, were, then, sent, out, into, the, countryside, to, construct, schools, train, new, educators, and, teach, the, predominantly, illiterate, guajiros, peasants, to, read, and, write, unlike, many, of, guevara, s, later, economic, initiatives, this, campaign, was, a, remarkable, success, by, the, completion, of, the, cuban, literacy, campaign, 707, 212, adults, had, been, taught, to, read, and, write, raising, the, national, literacy, rate, to, 96, accompanying, literacy, guevara, was, also, concerned, with, establishing, universal, access, to, higher, education, to, accomplish, this, the, new, regime, introduced, affirmative, action, to, the, universities, while, announcing, this, new, commitment, guevara, told, the, gathered, faculty, and, students, at, the, university, of, las, villas, that, the, days, when, education, was, a, privilege, of, the, white, middle, class, had, ended, the, university, he, said, must, paint, itself, black, mulatto, worker, and, peasant, if, it, did, not, he, warned, the, people, were, going, to, break, down, its, doors, and, paint, the, university, the, colors, they, like, in, september, 1960, when, guevara, was, asked, about, cuba, s, ideology, at, the, first, latin, american, congress, he, replied, if, i, were, asked, whether, our, revolution, is, communist, i, would, define, it, as, marxist, our, revolution, has, discovered, by, its, methods, the, paths, that, marx, pointed, out, consequently, when, enacting, and, advocating, cuban, policy, guevara, cited, the, political, philosopher, karl, marx, as, his, ideological, inspiration, in, defending, his, political, stance, guevara, confidently, remarked, there, are, truths, so, evident, so, much, a, part, of, people, s, knowledge, that, it, is, now, useless, to, discuss, them, one, ought, to, be, marxist, with, the, same, naturalness, with, which, one, is, newtonian, in, physics, or, pasteurian, in, biology, according, to, guevara, the, practical, revolutionaries, of, the, cuban, revolution, had, the, goal, of, simply, fulfill, ing, laws, foreseen, by, marx, the, scientist, using, marx, s, predictions, and, system, of, dialectical, materialism, guevara, professed, that, the, laws, of, marxism, are, present, in, the, events, of, the, cuban, revolution, independently, of, what, its, leaders, profess, or, fully, know, of, those, laws, from, a, theoretical, point, of, view, the, merit, of, marx, is, that, he, suddenly, produces, a, qualitative, change, in, the, history, of, social, thought, he, interprets, history, understands, its, dynamic, predicts, the, future, but, in, addition, to, predicting, it, which, would, satisfy, his, scientific, obligation, he, expresses, a, revolutionary, concept, the, world, must, not, only, be, interpreted, it, must, be, transformed, man, ceases, to, be, the, slave, and, tool, of, his, environment, and, converts, himself, into, the, architect, of, his, own, destiny, man, truly, achieves, his, full, human, condition, when, he, produces, without, being, compelled, by, the, physical, necessity, of, selling, himself, as, a, commodity, in, an, effort, to, eliminate, social, inequalities, guevara, and, cuba, s, new, leadership, had, moved, to, swiftly, transform, the, political, and, economic, base, of, the, country, through, nationalizing, factories, banks, and, businesses, while, attempting, to, ensure, affordable, housing, healthcare, and, employment, for, all, cubans, in, order, for, a, genuine, transformation, of, consciousness, to, take, root, it, was, believed, that, such, structural, changes, had, to, be, accompanied, by, a, conversion, in, people, s, social, relations, and, values, believing, that, the, attitudes, in, cuba, towards, race, women, individualism, and, manual, labor, were, the, product, of, the, island, s, outdated, past, all, individuals, were, urged, to, view, each, other, as, equals, and, take, on, the, values, of, what, guevara, termed, el, hombre, nuevo, the, new, man, guevara, hoped, his, new, man, to, be, ultimately, selfless, and, cooperative, obedient, and, hard, working, gender, blind, incorruptible, non, materialistic, and, anti, imperialist, to, accomplish, this, guevara, emphasized, the, tenets, of, marxism, leninism, and, wanted, to, use, the, state, to, emphasize, qualities, such, as, egalitarianism, and, self, sacrifice, at, the, same, time, as, unity, equality, and, freedom, became, the, new, maxims, guevara, s, first, desired, economic, goal, of, the, new, man, which, coincided, with, his, aversion, for, wealth, condensation, and, economic, inequality, was, to, see, a, nationwide, elimination, of, material, incentives, in, favor, of, moral, ones, he, negatively, viewed, capitalism, as, a, contest, among, wolves, where, one, can, only, win, at, the, cost, of, others, and, thus, desired, to, see, the, creation, of, a, new, man, and, woman, guevara, continually, stressed, that, a, socialist, economy, in, itself, is, not, worth, the, effort, sacrifice, and, risks, of, war, and, destruction, if, it, ends, up, encouraging, greed, and, individual, ambition, at, the, expense, of, collective, spirit, a, primary, goal, of, guevara, s, thus, became, to, reform, individual, consciousness, and, values, to, produce, better, workers, and, citizens, in, his, view, cuba, s, new, man, would, be, able, to, overcome, the, egotism, and, selfishness, that, he, loathed, and, discerned, was, uniquely, characteristic, of, individuals, in, capitalist, societies, to, promote, this, concept, of, a, new, man, the, government, also, created, a, series, of, party, dominated, institutions, and, mechanisms, on, all, levels, of, society, which, included, organizations, such, as, labor, groups, youth, leagues, women, s, groups, community, centers, and, houses, of, culture, to, promote, state, sponsored, art, music, and, literature, in, congruence, with, this, all, educational, mass, media, and, artistic, community, based, facilities, were, nationalized, and, utilized, to, instill, the, government, s, official, socialist, ideology, in, describing, this, new, method, of, development, guevara, stated, there, is, a, great, difference, between, free, enterprise, development, and, revolutionary, development, in, one, of, them, wealth, is, concentrated, in, the, hands, of, a, fortunate, few, the, friends, of, the, government, the, best, wheeler, dealers, in, the, other, wealth, is, the, people, s, patrimony, a, further, integral, part, of, fostering, a, sense, of, unity, between, the, individual, and, the, mass, guevara, believed, was, volunteer, work, and, will, to, display, this, guevara, led, by, example, working, endlessly, at, his, ministry, job, in, construction, and, even, cutting, sugar, cane, on, his, day, off, he, was, known, for, working, 36, hours, at, a, stretch, calling, meetings, after, midnight, and, eating, on, the, run, such, behavior, was, emblematic, of, guevara, s, new, program, of, moral, incentives, where, each, worker, was, now, required, to, meet, a, quota, and, produce, a, certain, quantity, of, goods, as, a, replacement, for, the, pay, increases, abolished, by, guevara, workers, who, exceeded, their, quota, now, only, received, a, certificate, of, commendation, while, workers, who, failed, to, meet, their, quotas, were, given, a, pay, cut, guevara, unapologetically, defended, his, personal, philosophy, towards, motivation, and, work, stating, this, is, not, a, matter, of, how, many, pounds, of, meat, one, might, be, able, to, eat, or, how, many, times, a, year, someone, can, go, to, the, beach, or, how, many, ornaments, from, abroad, one, might, be, able, to, buy, with, his, current, salary, what, really, matters, is, that, the, individual, feels, more, complete, with, much, more, internal, richness, and, much, more, responsibility, in, the, face, of, a, loss, of, commercial, connections, with, western, states, guevara, tried, to, replace, them, with, closer, commercial, relationships, with, eastern, bloc, states, visiting, a, number, of, marxist, states, and, signing, trade, agreements, with, them, at, the, end, of, 1960, he, visited, czechoslovakia, the, soviet, union, north, korea, hungary, and, east, germany, and, signed, for, instance, a, trade, agreement, in, east, berlin, on, 17, december, 1960, such, agreements, helped, cuba, s, economy, to, a, certain, degree, but, also, had, the, disadvantage, of, a, growing, economic, dependency, on, the, eastern, bloc, it, was, also, in, east, germany, where, guevara, met, tamara, bunke, later, known, as, tania, who, was, assigned, as, his, interpreter, and, who, joined, him, years, later, and, was, killed, with, him, in, bolivia, according, to, douglas, kellner, his, programs, were, unsuccessful, and, accompanied, a, rapid, drop, in, productivity, and, a, rapid, rise, in, absenteeism, in, a, meeting, with, french, economist, ren, dumont, guevara, blamed, the, inadequacy, of, the, agrarian, reform, law, enacted, by, the, cuban, government, in, 1959, which, turned, large, plantations, into, farm, cooperatives, or, split, up, land, amongst, peasants, in, guevara, s, opinion, this, situation, continued, to, promote, a, heightened, sense, of, individual, ownership, in, which, workers, could, not, see, the, positive, social, benefits, of, their, labor, leading, them, to, instead, seek, individual, material, gain, as, before, decades, later, che, s, former, deputy, ernesto, betancourt, subsequently, the, director, of, the, us, government, funded, radio, mart, and, an, early, ally, turned, castro, critic, accused, guevara, of, being, ignorant, of, the, most, elementary, economic, principles, on, 17, april, 1961, 1, 400, us, trained, cuban, exiles, invaded, cuba, during, the, bay, of, pigs, invasion, guevara, did, not, play, a, key, role, in, the, fighting, as, one, day, before, the, invasion, a, warship, carrying, marines, faked, an, invasion, off, the, west, coast, of, pinar, del, r, o, and, drew, forces, commanded, by, guevara, to, that, region, however, historians, give, him, a, share, of, credit, for, the, victory, as, he, was, director, of, instruction, for, cuba, s, armed, forces, at, the, time, author, tad, szulc, in, his, explanation, of, the, cuban, victory, assigns, guevara, partial, credit, stating, the, revolutionaries, won, because, che, guevara, as, the, head, of, the, instruction, department, of, the, revolutionary, armed, forces, in, charge, of, the, militia, training, program, had, done, so, well, in, preparing, 200, 000, men, and, women, for, war, it, was, also, during, this, deployment, that, he, suffered, a, bullet, grazing, to, the, cheek, when, his, pistol, fell, out, of, its, holster, and, accidentally, discharged, in, august, 1961, during, an, economic, conference, of, the, organization, of, american, states, in, punta, del, este, uruguay, che, guevara, sent, a, note, of, gratitude, to, united, states, president, john, f, kennedy, through, richard, n, goodwin, deputy, assistant, secretary, of, state, for, inter, american, affairs, it, read, thanks, for, playa, gir, n, bay, of, pigs, before, the, invasion, the, revolution, was, shaky, now, it, s, stronger, than, ever, in, response, to, united, states, treasury, secretary, douglas, dillon, presenting, the, alliance, for, progress, for, ratification, by, the, meeting, guevara, antagonistically, attacked, the, united, states, claim, of, being, a, democracy, stating, that, such, a, system, was, not, compatible, with, financial, oligarchy, discrimination, against, blacks, and, outrages, by, the, ku, klux, klan, guevara, continued, speaking, out, against, the, persecution, that, in, his, view, drove, scientists, like, oppenheimer, from, their, posts, deprived, the, world, for, years, of, the, marvelous, voice, of, paul, robeson, and, sent, the, rosenbergs, to, their, deaths, against, the, protests, of, a, shocked, world, guevara, ended, his, remarks, by, insinuating, that, the, united, states, was, not, interested, in, real, reforms, sardonically, quipping, that, u, s, experts, never, talk, about, agrarian, reform, they, prefer, a, safe, subject, like, a, better, water, supply, in, short, they, seem, to, prepare, the, revolution, of, the, toilets, nevertheless, goodwin, stated, in, his, memo, to, president, kennedy, following, the, meeting, that, guevara, viewed, him, as, someone, of, the, newer, generation, and, that, guevara, whom, goodwin, alleged, sent, a, message, to, him, the, day, after, the, meeting, through, one, of, the, meeting, s, argentine, participants, whom, he, described, as, darretta, also, viewed, the, conversation, which, the, two, had, as, quite, profitable, guevara, who, was, practically, the, architect, of, the, cuban, soviet, relationship, played, a, key, role, in, bringing, to, cuba, the, soviet, nuclear, armed, ballistic, missiles, that, precipitated, the, cuban, missile, crisis, in, october, 1962, and, brought, the, world, to, the, brink, of, nuclear, war, after, the, soviets, proposed, planting, nuclear, missiles, in, cuba, it, was, che, guevara, himself, who, traveled, to, the, soviet, union, on, 30, august, 1962, to, sign, off, on, the, final, agreement, guevara, argued, with, khruschev, that, the, missile, deal, should, be, made, public, but, khruschev, insisted, on, secrecy, and, swore, the, soviet, union, s, support, if, the, americans, discovered, the, missiles, by, the, time, guevara, arrived, in, cuba, the, united, states, had, already, discovered, the, soviet, troops, in, cuba, via, u, 2, spy, planes, a, few, weeks, after, the, crisis, during, an, interview, with, the, british, communist, newspaper, the, daily, worker, guevara, was, still, fuming, over, the, perceived, soviet, betrayal, and, told, correspondent, sam, russell, that, if, the, missiles, had, been, under, cuban, control, they, would, have, fired, them, off, while, expounding, on, the, incident, later, guevara, reiterated, that, the, cause, of, socialist, liberation, against, global, imperialist, aggression, would, ultimately, have, been, worth, the, possibility, of, millions, of, atomic, war, victims, the, missile, crisis, further, convinced, guevara, that, the, world, s, two, superpowers, the, united, states, and, the, soviet, union, used, cuba, as, a, pawn, in, their, own, global, strategies, afterward, he, denounced, the, soviets, almost, as, frequently, as, he, denounced, the, americans, the, era, in, cuban, history, retroactively, named, the, great, debate, by, historians, was, defined, by, public, debate, about, the, future, of, cuban, economic, policy, that, took, place, from, 1962, to, 1965, the, debate, began, after, cuba, fell, into, an, economic, crisis, in, 1962, after, years, of, internal, economic, complications, united, states, sanctions, and, the, flight, of, professionals, from, cuba, in, 1962, fidel, castro, invited, marxist, economists, around, the, world, to, debate, two, main, propositions, one, proposition, proposed, by, che, guevara, was, that, cuba, could, bypass, any, capitalist, then, socialist, transition, period, and, immediately, become, an, industrialized, communist, society, if, subjective, conditions, like, public, consciousness, and, vanguard, action, are, perfected, the, other, proposition, held, by, the, popular, socialist, party, was, that, cuba, required, a, transitionary, period, as, a, mixed, economy, in, which, cuba, s, sugar, economy, was, maximized, for, profit, before, a, communist, society, could, be, established, guevara, elaborated, in, this, period, that, moral, incentives, should, exist, as, the, main, motivator, to, increase, workers, production, all, profits, created, by, enterprises, were, to, be, given, to, the, state, budget, and, the, state, budget, would, cover, losses, institutions, that, developed, socialist, consciousness, were, regarded, as, the, most, important, element, in, maintaining, a, path, to, socialism, rather, than, materially, incentivized, increases, in, production, implementation, of, the, profit, motive, was, regarded, as, a, path, towards, capitalism, and, as, one, of, the, flaws, of, the, eastern, bloc, economies, the, economy, would, also, rely, on, mass, mobilizations, and, centralized, planning, as, a, method, for, developing, the, economy, the, main, ideal, that, compromised, the, consciousness, that, would, develop, socialism, was, the, praise, of, the, new, man, a, citizen, that, was, only, motivated, by, human, solidarity, and, self, sacrifice, in, 1966, the, cuban, economy, was, reorganized, on, moral, lines, cuban, propaganda, stressed, voluntarism, and, ideological, motivations, to, increase, productions, material, incentives, were, not, given, to, workers, who, were, more, productive, than, others, cuban, intellectuals, were, expected, to, participate, actively, in, creating, a, positive, national, ethos, and, ignore, any, desire, to, create, art, for, art, s, sake, in, 1968, all, non, agricultural, private, businesses, were, nationalized, central, planning, was, done, more, on, an, ad, hoc, basis, and, the, entire, cuban, economy, was, directed, at, producing, a, 10, million, ton, sugar, harvest, these, developments, were, generally, inspired, by, the, resolutions, brought, about, by, the, great, debate, years, earlier, the, focus, on, sugar, would, eventually, render, all, other, facets, of, the, cuban, economy, underdeveloped, and, would, be, the, ultimate, legacy, of, the, offensive, in, december, 1964, che, guevara, had, emerged, as, a, revolutionary, statesman, of, world, stature, and, thus, traveled, to, new, york, city, as, head, of, the, cuban, delegation, to, speak, at, the, united, nations, on, 11, december, 1964, during, guevara, s, hour, long, impassioned, address, at, the, un, he, criticized, the, united, nations, inability, to, confront, the, brutal, policy, of, apartheid, in, south, africa, asking, can, the, united, nations, do, nothing, to, stop, this, guevara, then, denounced, the, united, states, policy, towards, their, black, population, stating, those, who, kill, their, own, children, and, discriminate, daily, against, them, because, of, the, color, of, their, skin, those, who, let, the, murderers, of, blacks, remain, free, protecting, them, and, furthermore, punishing, the, black, population, because, they, demand, their, legitimate, rights, as, free, men, how, can, those, who, do, this, consider, themselves, guardians, of, freedom, an, indignant, guevara, ended, his, speech, by, reciting, the, second, declaration, of, havana, decreeing, latin, america, a, family, of, 200, million, brothers, who, suffer, the, same, miseries, this, epic, guevara, declared, would, be, written, by, the, hungry, indian, masses, peasants, without, land, exploited, workers, and, progressive, masses, to, guevara, the, conflict, was, a, struggle, of, masses, and, ideas, which, would, be, carried, forth, by, those, mistreated, and, scorned, by, imperialism, who, were, previously, considered, a, weak, and, submissive, flock, with, this, flock, guevara, now, asserted, yankee, monopoly, capitalism, now, terrifyingly, saw, their, gravediggers, it, would, be, during, this, hour, of, vindication, guevara, pronounced, that, the, anonymous, mass, would, begin, to, write, its, own, history, with, its, own, blood, and, reclaim, those, rights, that, were, laughed, at, by, one, and, all, for, 500, years, guevara, closed, his, remarks, to, the, general, assembly, by, hypothesizing, that, this, wave, of, anger, would, sweep, the, lands, of, latin, america, and, that, the, labor, masses, who, turn, the, wheel, of, history, were, now, for, the, first, time, awakening, from, the, long, brutalizing, sleep, to, which, they, had, been, subjected, guevara, later, learned, there, had, been, two, failed, attempts, on, his, life, by, cuban, exiles, during, his, stop, at, the, un, complex, the, first, from, molly, gonzales, who, tried, to, break, through, barricades, upon, his, arrival, with, a, seven, inch, hunting, knife, and, the, second, by, guillermo, novo, who, fired, a, timer, initiated, bazooka, from, a, boat, in, the, east, river, at, the, united, nations, headquarters, during, his, address, but, missed, and, was, off, target, afterwards, guevara, commented, on, both, incidents, stating, that, it, is, better, to, be, killed, by, a, woman, with, a, knife, than, by, a, man, with, a, gun, while, adding, with, a, languid, wave, of, his, cigar, that, the, explosion, had, given, the, whole, thing, more, flavor, while, in, new, york, guevara, appeared, on, the, cbs, sunday, news, program, face, the, nation, and, met, with, a, wide, range, of, people, from, united, states, senator, eugene, mccarthy, to, associates, of, malcolm, x, the, latter, expressed, his, admiration, declaring, guevara, one, of, the, most, revolutionary, men, in, this, country, right, now, while, reading, a, statement, from, him, to, a, crowd, at, the, audubon, ballroom, on, 17, december, guevara, left, new, york, for, paris, france, and, from, there, embarked, on, a, three, month, world, tour, that, included, visits, to, the, people, s, republic, of, china, north, korea, the, united, arab, republic, algeria, ghana, guinea, mali, dahomey, congo, brazzaville, and, tanzania, with, stops, in, ireland, and, prague, while, in, ireland, guevara, embraced, his, own, irish, heritage, celebrating, saint, patrick, s, day, in, limerick, he, wrote, to, his, father, on, this, visit, humorously, stating, i, am, in, this, green, ireland, of, your, ancestors, when, they, found, out, the, television, came, to, ask, me, about, the, lynch, genealogy, but, in, case, they, were, horse, thieves, or, something, like, that, i, didn, t, say, much, in, 1969, guevara, s, father, was, quoted, on, his, sons, irish, lineage, the, first, thing, to, note, is, that, in, my, son, s, veins, flowed, the, blood, of, the, irish, rebels, during, guevara, s, time, in, algeria, he, was, interviewed, by, spanish, poet, juan, goytisolo, inside, the, cuban, embassy, during, the, interview, guevara, noticed, a, book, by, openly, gay, cuban, writer, virgilio, pi, era, that, was, sitting, on, the, table, next, to, him, when, he, noticed, it, he, threw, the, book, against, the, wall, and, yelled, how, dare, you, have, in, our, embassy, a, book, by, this, foul, faggot, this, moment, has, been, marked, as, a, turn, in, goytisolo, s, personal, identity, as, it, influenced, him, to, slowly, come, out, of, the, closet, as, gay, and, begin, to, sympathize, with, the, lgbt, citizens, of, cuba, this, moment, has, also, been, marked, for, its, significance, in, the, cuban, government, s, slow, and, ultimately, final, ousting, of, pi, era, from, official, literary, discourse, in, cuba, pi, era, had, originally, been, regarded, as, an, important, dramatist, of, the, cuban, revolution, but, had, later, become, slowly, condemned, and, finally, arrested, during, this, voyage, he, wrote, a, letter, to, carlos, quijano, editor, of, a, uruguayan, weekly, which, was, later, retitled, socialism, and, man, in, cuba, outlined, in, the, treatise, was, guevara, s, summons, for, the, creation, of, a, new, consciousness, a, new, status, of, work, and, a, new, role, of, the, individual, he, also, laid, out, the, reasoning, behind, his, anti, capitalist, sentiments, stating, the, laws, of, capitalism, blind, and, invisible, to, the, majority, act, upon, the, individual, without, his, thinking, about, it, he, sees, only, the, vastness, of, a, seemingly, infinite, horizon, before, him, that, is, how, it, is, painted, by, capitalist, propagandists, who, purport, to, draw, a, lesson, from, the, example, of, rockefeller, whether, or, not, it, is, true, about, the, possibilities, of, success, the, amount, of, poverty, and, suffering, required, for, the, emergence, of, a, rockefeller, and, the, amount, of, depravity, that, the, accumulation, of, a, fortune, of, such, magnitude, entails, are, left, out, of, the, picture, and, it, is, not, always, possible, to, make, the, people, in, general, see, this, guevara, ended, the, essay, by, declaring, that, the, true, revolutionary, is, guided, by, a, great, feeling, of, love, and, beckoning, on, all, revolutionaries, to, strive, every, day, so, that, this, love, of, living, humanity, will, be, transformed, into, acts, that, serve, as, examples, thus, becoming, a, moving, force, the, genesis, for, guevara, s, assertions, relied, on, the, fact, that, he, believed, the, example, of, the, cuban, revolution, was, something, spiritual, that, would, transcend, all, borders, in, algiers, algeria, on, 24, february, 1965, guevara, made, what, turned, out, to, be, his, last, public, appearance, on, the, international, stage, when, he, delivered, a, speech, at, an, economic, seminar, on, afro, asian, solidarity, he, specified, the, moral, duty, of, the, socialist, countries, accusing, them, of, tacit, complicity, with, the, exploiting, western, countries, he, proceeded, to, outline, a, number, of, measures, which, he, said, the, communist, bloc, countries, must, implement, in, order, to, accomplish, the, defeat, of, imperialism, having, criticized, the, soviet, union, the, primary, financial, backer, of, cuba, in, such, a, public, manner, he, returned, to, cuba, on, 14, march, to, a, solemn, reception, by, fidel, and, ra, l, castro, osvaldo, dortic, s, and, carlos, rafael, rodr, guez, at, the, havana, airport, as, revealed, in, his, last, public, speech, in, algiers, guevara, had, come, to, view, the, northern, hemisphere, led, by, the, us, in, the, west, and, the, soviet, union, in, the, east, as, the, exploiter, of, the, southern, hemisphere, he, strongly, supported, communist, north, vietnam, in, the, vietnam, war, and, urged, the, peoples, of, other, developing, countries, to, take, up, arms, and, create, many, vietnams, che, s, denunciations, of, the, soviets, made, him, popular, among, intellectuals, and, artists, of, the, western, european, left, who, had, lost, faith, in, the, soviet, union, while, his, condemnation, of, imperialism, and, call, to, revolution, inspired, young, radical, students, in, the, united, states, who, were, impatient, for, societal, change, marx, characterized, the, psychological, or, philosophical, manifestation, of, capitalist, social, relations, as, alienation, and, antagonism, the, result, of, the, commodification, of, labor, and, the, operation, of, the, law, of, value, for, guevara, the, challenge, was, to, replace, the, individuals, alienation, from, the, productive, process, and, the, antagonism, generated, by, class, relations, with, integration, and, solidarity, developing, a, collective, attitude, to, production, and, the, concept, of, work, as, a, social, duty, helen, yaffe, author, of, che, guevara, the, economics, of, revolution, in, guevara, s, private, writings, from, this, time, since, released, he, displays, his, growing, criticism, of, the, soviet, political, economy, believing, that, the, soviets, had, forgotten, marx, this, led, guevara, to, denounce, a, range, of, soviet, practices, including, what, he, saw, as, their, attempt, to, air, brush, the, inherent, violence, of, class, struggle, integral, to, the, transition, from, capitalism, to, socialism, their, dangerous, policy, of, peaceful, co, existence, with, the, united, states, their, failure, to, push, for, a, change, in, consciousness, towards, the, idea, of, work, and, their, attempt, to, liberalize, the, socialist, economy, guevara, wanted, the, complete, elimination, of, money, interest, commodity, production, the, market, economy, and, mercantile, relationships, all, conditions, that, the, soviets, argued, would, only, disappear, when, world, communism, was, achieved, disagreeing, with, this, incrementalist, approach, guevara, criticized, the, soviet, manual, of, political, economy, predicting, that, if, the, soviet, union, did, not, abolish, the, law, of, value, as, guevara, desired, it, would, eventually, return, to, capitalism, two, weeks, after, his, algiers, speech, and, his, return, to, cuba, guevara, dropped, out, of, public, life, and, then, vanished, altogether, his, whereabouts, were, a, great, mystery, in, cuba, as, he, was, generally, regarded, as, second, in, power, to, castro, himself, his, disappearance, was, variously, attributed, to, the, failure, of, the, cuban, industrialization, scheme, he, had, advocated, while, minister, of, industries, to, pressure, exerted, on, castro, by, soviet, officials, who, disapproved, of, guevara, s, pro, chinese, communist, stance, on, the, sino, soviet, split, and, to, serious, differences, between, guevara, and, the, pragmatic, castro, regarding, cuba, s, economic, development, and, ideological, line, pressed, by, international, speculation, regarding, guevara, s, fate, castro, stated, on, 16, june, 1965, that, the, people, would, be, informed, when, guevara, himself, wished, to, let, them, know, still, rumors, spread, both, inside, and, outside, cuba, concerning, the, missing, guevara, s, whereabouts, there, are, various, rumors, from, retired, cuban, officials, who, were, around, the, castro, brothers, that, the, castro, brothers, and, guevara, had, a, strong, disagreement, after, guevara, s, algiers, speech, intelligence, files, from, the, east, german, embassy, in, cuba, detail, various, heated, exchanges, between, fidel, castro, and, che, guevara, after, guevara, s, return, from, africa, whether, castro, disagreed, with, guevara, s, criticisms, of, the, soviet, union, or, just, found, them, unproductive, to, express, on, the, world, stage, remains, unclear, on, 3, october, 1965, castro, publicly, revealed, an, undated, letter, purportedly, written, to, him, by, guevara, around, seven, months, earlier, which, was, later, titled, che, guevara, s, farewell, letter, in, the, letter, guevara, reaffirmed, his, enduring, solidarity, with, the, cuban, revolution, but, declared, his, intention, to, leave, cuba, to, fight, for, the, revolutionary, cause, abroad, additionally, he, resigned, from, all, his, positions, in, the, cuban, government, and, communist, party, and, renounced, his, honorary, cuban, citizenship, i, tried, to, make, them, understand, that, the, real, issue, was, not, the, liberation, of, any, given, state, but, a, common, war, against, the, common, master, who, was, one, and, the, same, in, mozambique, and, in, malawi, in, rhodesia, and, in, south, africa, in, the, congo, and, in, angola, but, not, one, of, them, agreed, che, guevara, in, february, 1965, after, meeting, with, various, african, liberation, movement, leaders, in, dar, es, salaam, tanzania, in, early, 1965, guevara, went, to, africa, to, offer, his, knowledge, and, experience, as, a, guerrilla, to, the, ongoing, conflict, in, the, congo, according, to, algerian, president, ahmed, ben, bella, guevara, thought, that, africa, was, imperialism, s, weak, link, and, so, had, enormous, revolutionary, potential, egyptian, president, gamal, abdel, nasser, who, had, fraternal, relations, with, che, since, his, 1959, visit, saw, guevara, s, plan, to, fight, in, congo, as, unwise, and, warned, that, he, would, become, a, tarzan, figure, doomed, to, failure, despite, the, warning, guevara, traveled, to, congo, using, the, alias, ram, n, ben, tez, he, led, the, cuban, operation, in, support, of, the, leftist, simba, movement, which, had, emerged, from, the, ongoing, congo, conflict, guevara, his, second, in, command, v, ctor, dreke, and, 12, other, cuban, expeditionaries, arrived, in, congo, on, 24, april, 1965, and, a, contingent, of, approximately, 100, afro, cubans, joined, them, soon, afterward, for, a, time, they, collaborated, with, guerrilla, leader, laurent, d, sir, kabila, who, had, helped, supporters, of, the, overthrown, prime, minister, patrice, lumumba, to, lead, an, unsuccessful, revolt, months, earlier, as, an, admirer, of, the, late, lumumba, guevara, declared, that, his, murder, should, be, a, lesson, for, all, of, us, guevara, with, limited, knowledge, of, swahili, and, the, local, languages, was, assigned, a, teenage, interpreter, freddy, ilanga, over, the, course, of, seven, months, ilanga, grew, to, admire, the, hard, working, guevara, who, showed, the, same, respect, to, black, people, as, he, did, to, whites, guevara, soon, became, disillusioned, with, the, poor, discipline, of, kabila, s, troops, and, later, dismissed, him, stating, nothing, leads, me, to, believe, he, is, the, man, of, the, hour, regardless, che, still, regarded, kabila, more, favorably, than, other, simba, leaders, several, of, whom, still, pretended, to, lead, rebel, forces, even, after, they, had, fled, into, exile, as, an, additional, obstacle, the, congolese, military, the, arm, e, nationale, congolaise, anc, was, aided, by, mercenary, troops, led, by, mike, hoare, and, supported, by, anti, castro, cuban, pilots, and, the, cia, these, forces, thwarted, guevara, s, movements, from, his, base, camp, in, the, mountains, near, the, village, of, fizi, on, lake, tanganyika, in, southeast, congo, they, were, able, to, monitor, his, communications, and, so, pre, empted, his, attacks, and, interdicted, his, supply, lines, although, guevara, tried, to, conceal, his, presence, in, congo, the, united, states, government, knew, his, location, and, activities, the, national, security, agency, was, intercepting, all, of, his, incoming, and, outgoing, transmissions, via, equipment, aboard, the, usns, private, jose, f, valdez, a, floating, listening, post, that, continuously, cruised, the, indian, ocean, off, dar, es, salaam, for, that, purpose, after, becoming, aware, of, the, communist, cubans, presence, in, eastern, congo, hoare, planned, his, strategies, to, explicitly, counter, their, guerrilla, warfare, tactics, guevara, s, aim, was, to, export, the, revolution, by, instructing, local, anti, mobutu, simba, fighters, in, marxist, ideology, and, foco, theory, strategies, of, guerrilla, warfare, in, his, congo, diary, book, he, cites, a, combination, of, incompetence, intransigence, and, infighting, among, the, congolese, rebels, as, key, reasons, for, the, revolt, s, failure, from, september, 1965, the, anc, and, its, allies, launched, operation, south, to, destroy, kabila, s, forces, with, the, support, of, che, and, his, cubans, the, simbas, put, up, substantial, resistance, regardless, the, rebels, were, increasingly, pushed, back, lost, their, supply, routes, and, suffered, under, failing, morale, guevara, himself, was, almost, killed, in, one, clash, of, the, operation, regardless, he, initially, wanted, to, continue, some, form, of, guerrilla, campaign, from, the, local, mountains, but, even, his, simba, allies, ultimately, told, him, that, the, rebellion, was, defeated, on, 20, november, 1965, suffering, from, dysentery, and, acute, asthma, and, disheartened, after, seven, months, of, defeats, and, inactivity, guevara, left, congo, with, the, six, cuban, survivors, of, his, 12, man, column, guevara, stated, that, he, had, planned, to, send, the, wounded, back, to, cuba, and, fight, in, the, congo, alone, until, his, death, as, a, revolutionary, example, but, after, being, urged, by, his, comrades, and, two, cuban, emissaries, personally, sent, by, castro, at, the, last, moment, he, reluctantly, agreed, to, leave, africa, during, that, day, and, night, guevara, s, forces, quietly, took, down, their, base, camp, burned, their, huts, and, destroyed, or, threw, weapons, into, lake, tanganyika, that, they, could, not, take, with, them, before, crossing, the, border, by, boat, into, tanzania, at, night, and, traveling, by, land, to, dar, es, salaam, in, speaking, about, his, experience, in, congo, months, later, guevara, concluded, that, he, left, rather, than, fight, to, the, death, because, the, human, element, failed, there, is, no, will, to, fight, the, leaders, are, corrupt, in, a, word, there, was, nothing, to, do, guevara, also, declared, that, we, can, not, liberate, all, by, ourselves, a, country, that, does, not, want, to, fight, a, few, weeks, later, he, wrote, the, preface, to, the, diary, he, kept, during, the, congo, venture, that, began, this, is, the, story, of, a, failure, following, the, failure, of, the, rebellion, in, the, congo, guevara, was, reluctant, to, return, to, cuba, because, castro, had, already, made, public, guevara, s, farewell, letter, a, letter, intended, to, only, be, revealed, in, the, case, of, his, death, wherein, he, severed, all, ties, in, order, to, devote, himself, to, revolution, throughout, the, world, as, a, result, guevara, spent, the, next, six, months, living, clandestinely, at, the, cuban, embassy, in, dar, es, salaam, and, later, at, a, cuban, safehouse, in, l, dv, near, prague, while, in, europe, guevara, made, a, secret, visit, to, former, argentine, president, juan, per, n, who, lived, in, exile, in, francoist, spain, where, he, confided, in, per, n, about, his, new, plan, to, formulate, a, communist, revolution, to, bring, all, of, latin, america, under, socialist, control, per, n, warned, guevara, that, his, plans, for, implementing, a, communist, revolution, throughout, latin, america, starting, with, bolivia, would, be, suicidal, and, futile, but, guevara, s, mind, was, already, made, up, later, per, n, remarked, that, guevara, was, an, immature, utopian, but, one, of, us, i, am, happy, for, it, to, be, so, because, he, is, giving, the, yankees, a, real, headache, during, this, time, abroad, guevara, compiled, his, memoirs, of, the, congo, experience, and, wrote, drafts, of, two, more, books, one, on, philosophy, and, the, other, on, economics, as, guevara, prepared, for, bolivia, he, secretly, traveled, back, to, cuba, on, 21, july, 1966, to, visit, castro, as, well, as, to, see, his, wife, and, to, write, a, last, letter, to, his, five, children, to, be, read, upon, his, death, which, ended, with, him, instructing, them, above, all, always, be, capable, of, feeling, deeply, any, injustice, committed, against, anyone, anywhere, in, the, world, this, is, the, most, beautiful, quality, in, a, revolutionary, in, late, 1966, guevara, s, location, was, still, not, public, knowledge, although, representatives, of, mozambique, s, independence, movement, the, frelimo, reported, that, they, met, with, guevara, in, dar, es, salaam, regarding, his, offer, to, aid, in, their, revolutionary, project, an, offer, which, they, ultimately, rejected, in, a, speech, at, the, 1967, international, workers, day, rally, in, havana, the, acting, minister, of, the, armed, forces, major, juan, almeida, bosque, announced, that, guevara, was, serving, the, revolution, somewhere, in, latin, america, in, his, book, op, ration, condor, published, in, 2020, french, journalist, pablo, daniel, magee, reconstitutes, the, first, incursion, of, che, guevara, in, bolivia, on, 3, october, 1966, based, on, top, secret, documents, kept, in, the, unesco, protected, archives, of, terror, in, paraguay, before, he, departed, for, bolivia, guevara, altered, his, appearance, by, shaving, off, his, beard, and, much, of, his, hair, also, dying, it, grey, so, that, he, was, unrecognizable, as, che, guevara, on, 3, november, 1966, guevara, secretly, arrived, in, la, paz, on, a, flight, from, montevideo, under, the, false, name, adolfo, mena, gonz, lez, posing, as, a, middle, aged, uruguayan, businessman, working, for, the, organization, of, american, states, three, days, after, his, arrival, in, bolivia, guevara, left, la, paz, for, the, rural, south, east, region, of, the, country, to, form, his, guerrilla, army, guevara, s, first, base, camp, was, located, in, the, montane, dry, forest, in, the, remote, ancahuaz, region, training, at, the, camp, in, the, ancahuaz, valley, proved, to, be, hazardous, and, little, was, accomplished, in, way, of, building, a, guerrilla, army, the, argentine, born, east, german, operative, tamara, bunke, better, known, by, her, nom, de, guerre, tania, had, been, installed, as, che, s, primary, agent, in, la, paz, guevara, s, guerrilla, force, numbering, about, 50, men, and, operating, as, the, eln, ej, rcito, de, liberaci, n, nacional, de, bolivia, national, liberation, army, of, bolivia, was, well, equipped, and, scored, a, number, of, early, successes, against, bolivian, army, regulars, in, the, difficult, terrain, of, the, mountainous, camiri, region, during, the, early, months, of, 1967, as, a, result, of, guevara, s, units, winning, several, skirmishes, against, bolivian, troops, in, the, spring, and, summer, of, 1967, the, bolivian, government, began, to, overestimate, the, true, size, of, the, guerrilla, force, researchers, hypothesize, that, guevara, s, plan, for, fomenting, a, revolution, in, bolivia, failed, for, an, array, of, reasons, in, addition, guevara, s, known, preference, for, confrontation, rather, than, compromise, which, had, previously, surfaced, during, his, guerrilla, warfare, campaign, in, cuba, contributed, to, his, inability, to, develop, successful, working, relationships, with, local, rebel, leaders, in, bolivia, just, as, it, had, in, the, congo, this, tendency, had, existed, in, cuba, but, had, been, kept, in, check, by, the, timely, interventions, and, guidance, of, fidel, castro, the, result, was, that, guevara, was, unable, to, attract, inhabitants, of, the, local, area, to, join, his, militia, during, the, eleven, months, he, attempted, recruitment, many, of, the, inhabitants, willingly, informed, the, bolivian, authorities, and, military, about, the, guerrillas, and, their, movements, in, the, area, near, the, end, of, the, bolivian, venture, guevara, wrote, in, his, diary, talking, to, these, peasants, is, like, talking, to, statues, they, do, not, give, us, any, help, worse, still, many, of, them, are, turning, into, informants, f, lix, rodr, guez, a, cuban, exile, turned, cia, special, activities, division, operative, advised, bolivian,

cia, orchestrate, guevara, s, eventual, capture, on, 7, october, 1967, an, informant, apprised, the, bolivian, special, forces, of, the, location, of, guevara, s, guerrilla, encampment, in, the, yuro, ravine, on, the, morning, of, 8, october, they, encircled, the, area, with, two, companies, numbering, 180, soldiers, and, advanced, into, the, ravine, triggering, a, battle, where, guevara, was, wounded, and, taken, prisoner, while, leading, a, detachment, with, simeon, cuba, sarabia, che, s, biographer, jon, lee, anderson, reports, bolivian, sergeant, bernardino, huanca, s, account, that, as, the, bolivian, rangers, approached, a, twice, wounded, guevara, his, gun, rendered, useless, threw, up, his, arms, in, surrender, and, shouted, to, the, soldiers, do, not, shoot, i, am, che, guevara, and, i, am, worth, more, to, you, alive, than, dead, guevara, was, tied, up, and, taken, to, a, dilapidated, mud, schoolhouse, in, the, nearby, village, of, la, higuera, on, the, evening, of, 8, october, for, the, next, half, day, guevara, refused, to, be, interrogated, by, bolivian, officers, and, only, spoke, quietly, to, bolivian, soldiers, one, of, those, bolivian, soldiers, a, helicopter, pilot, named, jaime, nino, de, guzman, describes, che, as, looking, dreadful, according, to, guzman, guevara, was, shot, through, the, right, calf, his, hair, was, matted, with, dirt, his, clothes, were, shredded, and, his, feet, were, covered, in, rough, leather, sheaths, despite, his, haggard, appearance, he, recounts, that, che, held, his, head, high, looked, everyone, straight, in, the, eyes, and, asked, only, for, something, to, smoke, de, guzman, states, that, he, took, pity, and, gave, him, a, small, bag, of, tobacco, for, his, pipe, and, that, guevara, then, smiled, and, thanked, him, later, on, the, night, of, 8, october, guevara, despite, having, his, hands, tied, kicked, a, bolivian, army, officer, named, captain, espinosa, against, a, wall, after, the, officer, entered, the, schoolhouse, and, tried, to, snatch, guevara, s, pipe, from, his, mouth, as, a, souvenir, while, he, was, still, smoking, it, in, another, instance, of, defiance, guevara, spat, in, the, face, of, bolivian, rear, admiral, horacio, ugarteche, who, attempted, to, question, guevara, a, few, hours, before, his, execution, the, following, morning, on, 9, october, guevara, asked, to, see, the, school, teacher, of, the, village, a, 22, year, old, woman, named, julia, cortez, she, later, stated, that, she, found, guevara, to, be, an, agreeable, looking, man, with, a, soft, and, ironic, glance, and, that, during, their, conversation, she, found, herself, unable, to, look, him, in, the, eye, because, his, gaze, was, unbearable, piercing, and, so, tranquil, during, their, short, conversation, guevara, pointed, out, to, cortez, the, poor, condition, of, the, schoolhouse, stating, that, it, was, anti, pedagogical, to, expect, campesino, students, to, be, educated, there, while, government, officials, drive, mercedes, cars, guevara, said, that, s, what, we, are, fighting, against, later, on, the, morning, of, 9, october, bolivian, president, ren, barrientos, ordered, that, guevara, be, killed, the, order, was, relayed, to, the, unit, holding, guevara, by, f, lix, rodr, guez, reportedly, despite, the, united, states, government, s, desire, that, guevara, be, taken, to, panama, for, further, interrogation, the, executioner, who, volunteered, to, kill, guevara, was, mario, ter, n, a, 27, year, old, sergeant, in, the, bolivian, army, who, while, half, drunk, requested, to, shoot, guevara, because, three, of, his, friends, from, b, company, all, with, the, same, first, name, of, mario, had, been, killed, in, a, firefight, several, days, earlier, with, guevara, s, band, of, guerrillas, to, make, the, bullet, wounds, appear, consistent, with, the, story, that, the, bolivian, government, planned, to, release, to, the, public, f, lix, rodr, guez, ordered, ter, n, not, to, shoot, guevara, in, the, head, but, to, aim, carefully, to, make, it, appear, that, guevara, had, been, killed, in, action, during, a, clash, with, the, bolivian, army, gary, prado, salm, n, the, bolivian, captain, in, command, of, the, army, company, that, captured, guevara, said, that, the, reasons, barrientos, ordered, the, immediate, execution, of, guevara, were, so, there, could, be, no, possibility, for, guevara, to, escape, from, prison, and, also, so, there, could, be, no, drama, of, a, public, trial, where, adverse, publicity, might, happen, about, 30, minutes, before, guevara, was, killed, f, lix, rodr, guez, attempted, to, question, him, about, the, whereabouts, of, other, guerrilla, fighters, who, were, currently, at, large, but, guevara, continued, to, remain, silent, rodr, guez, assisted, by, a, few, bolivian, soldiers, helped, guevara, to, his, feet, and, took, him, outside, the, hut, to, parade, him, before, other, bolivian, soldiers, where, he, posed, with, guevara, for, a, photo, opportunity, where, one, soldier, took, a, photograph, of, rodr, guez, and, other, soldiers, standing, alongside, guevara, afterwards, rodr, guez, told, guevara, that, he, was, going, to, be, executed, a, little, later, guevara, was, asked, by, one, of, the, bolivian, soldiers, guarding, him, if, he, was, thinking, about, his, own, immortality, no, he, replied, i, m, thinking, about, the, immortality, of, the, revolution, a, few, minutes, later, sergeant, ter, n, entered, the, hut, to, shoot, him, whereupon, guevara, reportedly, stood, up, and, spoke, to, ter, n, what, were, his, last, words, i, know, you, ve, come, to, kill, me, shoot, coward, you, are, only, going, to, kill, a, man, ter, n, hesitated, then, pointed, his, self, loading, m2, carbine, at, guevara, and, opened, fire, hitting, him, in, the, arms, and, legs, then, as, guevara, writhed, on, the, ground, apparently, biting, one, of, his, wrists, to, avoid, crying, out, ter, n, fired, another, burst, fatally, wounding, him, in, the, chest, guevara, was, pronounced, dead, at, 1, 10, pm, local, time, according, to, rodr, guez, in, all, guevara, was, shot, nine, times, by, ter, n, this, included, five, times, in, his, legs, once, in, the, right, shoulder, and, arm, and, once, in, the, chest, and, throat, months, earlier, during, his, last, public, declaration, to, the, tricontinental, conference, guevara, had, written, his, own, epitaph, stating, wherever, death, may, surprise, us, let, it, be, welcome, provided, that, this, our, battle, cry, may, have, reached, some, receptive, ear, and, another, hand, may, be, extended, to, wield, our, weapons, after, his, execution, guevara, s, body, was, lashed, to, the, landing, skids, of, a, helicopter, and, flown, to, nearby, vallegrande, where, photographs, were, taken, of, him, lying, on, a, concrete, slab, in, the, laundry, room, of, the, nuestra, se, ora, de, malta, several, witnesses, were, called, to, confirm, his, identity, key, amongst, them, the, british, journalist, richard, gott, the, only, witness, to, have, met, guevara, when, he, was, alive, put, on, display, as, hundreds, of, local, residents, filed, past, the, body, guevara, s, corpse, was, considered, by, many, to, represent, a, christ, like, visage, with, some, even, surreptitiously, clipping, locks, of, his, hair, as, divine, relics, such, comparisons, were, further, extended, when, english, art, critic, john, berger, two, weeks, later, upon, seeing, the, post, mortem, photographs, observed, that, they, resembled, two, famous, paintings, rembrandt, s, the, anatomy, lesson, of, dr, nicolaes, tulp, and, andrea, mantegna, s, lamentation, over, the, dead, christ, there, were, also, four, correspondents, present, when, guevara, s, body, arrived, in, vallegrande, including, bj, rn, kumm, of, the, swedish, aftonbladet, who, described, the, scene, in, an, 11, november, 1967, exclusive, for, the, new, republic, a, declassified, memorandum, dated, 11, october, 1967, to, united, states, president, lyndon, b, johnson, from, his, national, security, advisor, walt, rostow, called, the, decision, to, kill, guevara, stupid, but, understandable, from, a, bolivian, standpoint, after, the, execution, rodr, guez, took, several, of, guevara, s, personal, items, including, a, watch, which, he, continued, to, wear, many, years, later, often, showing, them, to, reporters, during, the, ensuing, years, today, some, of, these, belongings, including, his, flashlight, are, on, display, at, the, cia, after, a, military, doctor, dismembered, his, hands, bolivian, army, officers, transferred, guevara, s, body, to, an, undisclosed, location, and, refused, to, reveal, whether, his, remains, had, been, buried, or, cremated, the, hands, were, sent, to, buenos, aires, for, fingerprint, identification, they, were, later, sent, to, cuba, on, 15, october, in, havana, fidel, castro, publicly, acknowledged, that, guevara, was, dead, and, proclaimed, three, days, of, public, mourning, throughout, cuba, on, 18, october, castro, addressed, a, crowd, of, one, million, mourners, in, havana, s, plaza, de, la, revoluci, n, and, spoke, about, guevara, s, character, as, a, revolutionary, fidel, castro, closed, his, impassioned, eulogy, thus, if, we, wish, to, express, what, we, want, the, men, of, future, generations, to, be, we, must, say, let, them, be, like, che, if, we, wish, to, say, how, we, want, our, children, to, be, educated, we, must, say, without, hesitation, we, want, them, to, be, educated, in, che, s, spirit, if, we, want, the, model, of, a, man, who, does, not, belong, to, our, times, but, to, the, future, i, say, from, the, depths, of, my, heart, that, such, a, model, without, a, single, stain, on, his, conduct, without, a, single, stain, on, his, action, is, che, also, removed, when, guevara, was, captured, were, his, 30, 000, word, hand, written, diary, a, collection, of, his, personal, poetry, and, a, short, story, he, had, authored, about, a, young, communist, guerrilla, who, learns, to, overcome, his, fears, his, diary, documented, events, of, the, guerrilla, campaign, in, bolivia, with, the, first, entry, on, 7, november, 1966, shortly, after, his, arrival, at, the, farm, in, ancahuaz, and, the, last, dated, 7, october, 1967, the, day, before, his, capture, the, diary, tells, how, the, guerrillas, were, forced, to, begin, operations, prematurely, because, of, discovery, by, the, bolivian, army, explains, guevara, s, decision, to, divide, the, column, into, two, units, that, were, subsequently, unable, to, re, establish, contact, and, describes, their, overall, unsuccessful, venture, it, also, records, the, rift, between, guevara, and, the, communist, party, of, bolivia, that, resulted, in, guevara, having, significantly, fewer, soldiers, than, originally, expected, and, shows, that, guevara, had, a, great, deal, of, difficulty, recruiting, from, the, local, populace, partly, because, the, guerrilla, group, had, learned, quechua, unaware, that, the, local, language, was, actually, a, tupi, guarani, language, as, the, campaign, drew, to, an, unexpected, close, guevara, became, increasingly, ill, he, endured, ever, worsening, bouts, of, asthma, and, most, of, his, last, offensives, were, carried, out, in, an, attempt, to, obtain, medicine, the, bolivian, diary, was, quickly, and, crudely, translated, by, ramparts, magazine, and, circulated, around, the, world, there, are, at, least, four, additional, diaries, in, existence, those, of, israel, reyes, zayas, alias, braulio, harry, villegas, tamayo, pombo, eliseo, reyes, rodriguez, rolando, and, dariel, alarc, n, ram, rez, benigno, each, of, which, reveals, additional, aspects, of, the, events, french, intellectual, r, gis, debray, who, was, captured, in, april, 1967, while, with, guevara, in, bolivia, gave, an, interview, from, prison, in, august, 1968, in, which, he, enlarged, on, the, circumstances, of, guevara, s, capture, debray, who, had, lived, with, guevara, s, band, of, guerrillas, for, a, short, time, said, that, in, his, view, they, were, victims, of, the, forest, and, thus, eaten, by, the, jungle, debray, described, a, destitute, situation, where, guevara, s, men, suffered, malnutrition, lack, of, water, absence, of, shoes, and, only, possessed, six, blankets, for, 22, men, debray, recounts, that, guevara, and, the, others, had, been, suffering, an, illness, which, caused, their, hands, and, feet, to, swell, into, mounds, of, flesh, to, the, point, where, you, could, not, discern, the, fingers, on, their, hands, debray, described, guevara, as, optimistic, about, the, future, of, latin, america, despite, the, futile, situation, and, remarked, that, guevara, was, resigned, to, die, in, the, knowledge, that, his, death, would, be, a, sort, of, renaissance, noting, that, guevara, perceived, death, as, a, promise, of, rebirth, and, ritual, of, renewal, radical, left, wing, activists, responded, to, guevara, s, apparent, indifference, to, rewards, and, glory, and, concurred, with, guevara, s, sanctioning, of, violence, as, a, necessity, to, instill, socialist, ideals, even, in, the, united, states, the, government, which, guevara, so, vigorously, denounced, students, began, to, emulate, his, style, of, dress, donning, military, fatigues, berets, and, growing, their, hair, and, beards, to, show, that, they, too, were, opponents, of, us, foreign, policy, for, instance, the, black, panthers, began, to, style, themselves, che, type, while, adopting, his, trademark, black, beret, while, arab, guerrillas, began, to, name, combat, operations, in, his, honor, addressing, the, wide, ranging, flexibility, of, his, legacy, trisha, ziff, director, of, the, 2008, documentary, chevolution, has, remarked, that, che, guevara, s, significance, in, modern, times, is, less, about, the, man, and, his, specific, history, and, more, about, the, ideals, of, creating, a, better, society, in, a, similar, vein, the, chilean, writer, ariel, dorfman, has, suggested, guevara, s, enduring, appeal, might, be, because, to, those, who, will, never, follow, in, his, footsteps, submerged, as, they, are, in, a, world, of, cynicism, self, interest, and, frantic, consumption, nothing, could, be, more, vicariously, gratifying, than, che, s, disdain, for, material, comfort, and, everyday, desires, to, a, certain, extent, the, belief, of, guevara, s, of, a, metaphorical, resurrection, after, death, came, true, after, pictures, of, the, dead, guevara, began, being, circulated, and, the, circumstances, of, his, death, were, being, debated, che, s, legend, began, to, spread, demonstrations, in, protest, against, his, assassination, occurred, throughout, the, world, and, articles, tributes, and, poems, were, written, about, his, life, and, death, rallies, in, support, of, guevara, were, held, from, mexico, to, santiago, algiers, to, angola, and, cairo, to, calcutta, the, population, of, budapest, and, prague, lit, candles, to, honor, guevara, s, passing, and, the, picture, of, a, smiling, che, appeared, in, london, and, paris, when, a, few, months, later, riots, broke, out, in, berlin, france, and, chicago, and, the, unrest, spread, to, the, american, college, campuses, young, men, and, women, wore, che, guevara, t, shirts, and, carried, his, pictures, during, their, protest, marches, in, the, view, of, military, historian, erik, durschmied, in, those, heady, months, of, 1968, che, guevara, was, not, dead, he, was, very, much, alive, in, late, 1995, the, retired, bolivian, general, mario, vargas, revealed, to, jon, lee, anderson, author, of, che, guevara, a, revolutionary, life, that, guevara, s, corpse, lay, near, a, vallegrande, airstrip, the, result, was, a, multi, national, search, for, the, remains, which, lasted, more, than, a, year, in, july, 1997, a, team, of, cuban, geologists, and, argentine, forensic, anthropologists, discovered, the, remnants, of, seven, bodies, in, two, mass, graves, including, one, man, without, hands, as, guevara, would, have, been, bolivian, government, officials, with, the, ministry, of, interior, later, identified, the, body, as, guevara, when, the, excavated, teeth, perfectly, matched, a, plaster, mold, of, che, s, teeth, made, in, cuba, prior, to, his, congolese, expedition, the, clincher, then, arrived, when, argentine, forensic, anthropologist, alejandro, inchaurregui, inspected, the, inside, hidden, pocket, of, a, blue, jacket, dug, up, next, to, the, handless, cadaver, and, found, a, small, bag, of, pipe, tobacco, nino, de, guzman, the, bolivian, helicopter, pilot, who, had, given, che, a, small, bag, of, tobacco, later, remarked, that, he, had, serious, doubts, at, first, and, thought, the, cubans, would, just, find, any, old, bones, and, call, it, che, but, after, hearing, about, the, tobacco, pouch, i, have, no, doubts, on, 17, october, 1997, 30, years, and, 8, days, after, guevara, s, death, guevara, s, remains, with, those, of, six, of, his, fellow, combatants, were, laid, to, rest, with, military, honors, in, a, specially, built, mausoleum, in, the, cuban, city, of, santa, clara, where, he, had, commanded, over, the, decisive, military, victory, of, the, cuban, revolution, in, july, 2008, the, bolivian, government, of, evo, morales, unveiled, guevara, s, formerly, sealed, diaries, composed, in, two, frayed, notebooks, along, with, a, logbook, and, several, black, and, white, photographs, at, this, event, bolivia, s, vice, minister, of, culture, pablo, groux, expressed, that, there, were, plans, to, publish, photographs, of, every, handwritten, page, later, in, the, year, meanwhile, in, august, 2009, anthropologists, working, for, bolivia, s, justice, ministry, discovered, and, unearthed, the, bodies, of, five, of, guevara, s, fellow, guerrillas, near, the, bolivian, town, of, teoponte, the, discovery, of, che, s, remains, metonymically, activated, a, series, of, interlinked, associations, rebel, martyr, rogue, figure, from, a, picaresque, adventure, savior, renegade, extremist, in, which, there, was, no, fixed, divide, among, them, the, current, court, of, opinion, places, che, on, a, continuum, that, teeters, between, viewing, him, as, a, misguided, rebel, a, coruscatingly, brilliant, guerrilla, philosopher, a, poet, warrior, jousting, at, windmills, a, brazen, warrior, who, threw, down, the, gauntlet, to, the, bourgeoisie, the, object, of, fervent, paeans, to, his, sainthood, or, a, mass, murderer, clothed, in, the, guise, of, an, avenging, angel, whose, every, action, is, imbricated, in, violence, the, archetypal, fanatical, terrorist, guevara, s, life, and, legacy, remain, contentious, the, perceived, contradictions, of, his, ethos, at, various, points, in, his, life, have, created, a, complex, character, of, duality, one, who, was, able, to, wield, the, pen, and, submachine, gun, with, equal, skill, while, prophesying, that, the, most, important, revolutionary, ambition, was, to, see, man, liberated, from, his, alienation, guevara, s, paradoxical, standing, is, further, complicated, by, his, array, of, seemingly, diametrically, opposed, qualities, a, secular, humanist, and, sympathetic, practitioner, of, medicine, who, did, not, hesitate, to, shoot, his, enemies, a, celebrated, internationalist, leader, who, advocated, violence, to, enforce, a, utopian, philosophy, of, the, collective, good, an, idealistic, intellectual, who, loved, literature, but, refused, to, allow, dissent, an, anti, imperialist, marxist, insurgent, who, was, radically, willing, to, forge, a, poverty, less, new, world, on, the, apocalyptic, ashes, of, the, old, one, and, finally, an, outspoken, anti, capitalist, whose, image, has, been, commoditized, che, s, history, continues, to, be, rewritten, and, re, imagined, moreover, sociologist, michael, l, wy, contends, that, the, many, facets, of, guevara, s, life, i, e, doctor, and, economist, revolutionary, and, banker, military, theoretician, and, ambassador, deep, thinker, and, political, agitator, illuminated, the, rise, of, the, che, myth, allowing, him, to, be, invariably, crystallized, in, his, many, metanarrative, roles, as, a, red, robin, hood, don, quixote, of, communism, new, garibaldi, marxist, saint, just, cid, campeador, of, the, wretched, of, the, earth, sir, galahad, of, the, beggars, and, bolshevik, devil, who, haunts, the, dreams, of, the, rich, kindling, braziers, of, subversion, all, over, the, world, as, such, various, notable, individuals, have, lauded, guevara, for, example, nelson, mandela, referred, to, him, as, an, inspiration, for, every, human, being, who, loves, freedom, while, jean, paul, sartre, described, him, as, not, only, an, intellectual, but, also, the, most, complete, human, being, of, our, age, others, who, have, expressed, their, admiration, include, authors, graham, greene, who, remarked, that, guevara, represented, the, idea, of, gallantry, chivalry, and, adventure, and, susan, sontag, who, supposed, that, goal, was, nothing, less, than, the, cause, of, humanity, itself, in, the, pan, african, community, philosopher, frantz, fanon, professed, guevara, to, be, the, world, symbol, of, the, possibilities, of, one, man, while, black, power, leader, stokely, carmichael, eulogized, that, che, guevara, is, not, dead, his, ideas, are, with, us, praise, has, been, reflected, throughout, the, political, spectrum, with, libertarian, theorist, murray, rothbard, extolling, guevara, as, a, heroic, figure, who, more, than, any, man, of, our, epoch, or, even, of, our, century, was, the, living, embodiment, of, the, principle, of, revolution, while, journalist, christopher, hitchens, reminisced, that, death, meant, a, lot, to, me, and, countless, like, me, at, the, time, he, was, a, role, model, albeit, an, impossible, one, for, us, bourgeois, romantics, insofar, as, he, went, and, did, what, revolutionaries, were, meant, to, do, fought, and, died, for, his, beliefs, former, cia, employee, philip, agee, said, there, was, no, person, more, feared, by, the, company, cia, than, che, guevara, because, he, had, the, capacity, and, charisma, necessary, to, direct, the, struggle, against, the, political, repression, of, the, traditional, hierarchies, in, power, in, the, countries, of, latin, america, conversely, jacobo, machover, an, exiled, opposition, author, dismisses, all, praise, of, guevara, and, portrays, him, as, a, callous, executioner, exiled, former, cuban, prisoners, have, expressed, similar, opinions, among, them, armando, valladares, who, declared, guevara, a, man, full, of, hatred, who, executed, dozens, without, trial, and, carlos, alberto, montaner, who, asserted, that, guevara, possessed, a, robespierre, mentality, wherein, cruelty, against, the, revolution, s, enemies, was, a, virtue, lvaro, vargas, llosa, of, the, independent, institute, has, hypothesized, that, guevara, s, contemporary, followers, delude, themselves, by, clinging, to, a, myth, describing, guevara, as, a, marxist, puritan, who, employed, his, rigid, power, to, suppress, dissent, while, also, operating, as, a, cold, blooded, killing, machine, llosa, also, accuses, guevara, s, fanatical, disposition, as, being, the, linchpin, of, the, sovietization, of, the, cuban, revolution, speculating, that, he, possessed, a, total, subordination, of, reality, to, blind, ideological, orthodoxy, on, a, macro, level, hoover, institution, research, fellow, william, ratliff, regards, guevara, more, as, a, creation, of, his, historical, environment, referring, to, him, as, a, fearless, and, head, strong, messiah, like, figure, who, was, the, product, of, a, martyr, enamored, latin, american, culture, which, inclined, people, to, seek, out, and, follow, paternalistic, miracle, workers, ratliff, further, speculates, that, the, economic, conditions, in, the, region, suited, guevara, s, commitment, to, bring, justice, to, the, downtrodden, by, crushing, centuries, old, tyrannies, describing, latin, america, as, being, plagued, by, what, mois, s, na, m, referred, to, as, the, legendary, malignancies, of, inequality, poverty, dysfunctional, politics, and, malfunctioning, institutions, in, a, mixed, assessment, british, historian, hugh, thomas, opined, that, guevara, was, a, brave, sincere, and, determined, man, who, was, also, obstinate, narrow, and, dogmatic, at, the, end, of, his, life, according, to, thomas, he, seems, to, have, become, convinced, of, the, virtues, of, violence, for, its, own, sake, while, his, influence, over, castro, for, good, or, evil, grew, after, his, death, as, fidel, took, up, many, of, his, views, similarly, the, cuban, american, sociologist, samuel, farber, lauds, che, guevara, as, an, honest, and, committed, revolutionary, but, also, criticizes, the, fact, that, he, never, embraced, socialism, in, its, most, democratic, essence, nevertheless, guevara, remains, a, national, hero, in, cuba, where, his, image, adorns, the, 3, peso, banknote, and, school, children, begin, each, morning, by, pledging, we, will, be, like, che, in, his, homeland, of, argentina, where, high, schools, bear, his, name, numerous, che, museums, dot, the, country, and, in, 2008, a, 3, 5, metre, 12, ft, bronze, statue, of, him, was, unveiled, in, the, city, of, his, birth, rosario, guevara, has, been, sanctified, by, some, bolivian, campesinos, as, saint, ernesto, who, pray, to, him, for, assistance, in, contrast, guevara, remains, a, hated, figure, amongst, many, in, the, cuban, exile, and, cuban, american, community, of, the, united, states, who, view, him, as, the, butcher, of, la, caba, a, despite, this, polarized, status, a, high, contrast, monochrome, graphic, of, che, s, face, created, in, 1968, by, irish, artist, jim, fitzpatrick, became, a, universally, merchandized, and, objectified, image, found, on, an, endless, array, of, items, including, t, shirts, hats, posters, tattoos, and, bikinis, contributing, to, the, consumer, culture, guevara, despised, yet, he, still, remains, a, transcendent, figure, both, in, specifically, political, contexts, and, as, a, wide, ranging, popular, icon, of, youthful, rebellion, guevara, received, several, honors, of, state, during, his, life, main, books, films
