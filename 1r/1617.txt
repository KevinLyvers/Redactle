hans, albrecht, bethe, german, pronunciation, july, 2, 1906, march, 6, 2005, was, a, german, american, theoretical, physicist, who, made, major, contributions, to, nuclear, physics, astrophysics, quantum, electrodynamics, and, solid, state, physics, and, who, won, the, 1967, nobel, prize, in, physics, for, his, work, on, the, theory, of, stellar, nucleosynthesis, for, most, of, his, career, bethe, was, a, professor, at, cornell, university, during, world, war, ii, he, was, head, of, the, theoretical, division, at, the, secret, los, alamos, laboratory, that, developed, the, first, atomic, bombs, there, he, played, a, key, role, in, calculating, the, critical, mass, of, the, weapons, and, developing, the, theory, behind, the, implosion, method, used, in, both, the, trinity, test, and, the, fat, man, weapon, dropped, on, nagasaki, in, august, 1945, after, the, war, bethe, also, played, an, important, role, in, the, development, of, the, hydrogen, bomb, although, he, had, originally, joined, the, project, with, the, hope, of, proving, it, could, not, be, made, bethe, later, campaigned, with, albert, einstein, and, the, emergency, committee, of, atomic, scientists, against, nuclear, testing, and, the, nuclear, arms, race, he, helped, persuade, the, kennedy, and, nixon, administrations, to, sign, respectively, the, 1963, partial, nuclear, test, ban, treaty, and, 1972, anti, ballistic, missile, treaty, salt, i, his, scientific, research, never, ceased, and, he, was, publishing, papers, well, into, his, nineties, making, him, one, of, the, few, scientists, to, have, published, at, least, one, major, paper, in, his, field, during, every, decade, of, his, career, which, in, bethe, s, case, spanned, nearly, seventy, years, freeman, dyson, once, his, doctoral, student, called, him, the, supreme, problem, solver, of, the, 20th, century, bethe, was, born, in, strasbourg, which, at, the, time, was, part, of, the, reichsland, elsa, lothringen, germany, on, july, 2, 1906, the, only, child, of, anna, n, e, kuhn, and, albrecht, bethe, a, privatdozent, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, although, his, mother, the, daughter, of, abraham, kuhn, professor, at, the, university, of, strasbourg, had, a, jewish, background, bethe, was, raised, protestant, like, his, father, and, he, became, an, atheist, later, in, life, his, father, accepted, a, position, as, professor, and, director, of, the, institute, of, physiology, at, the, university, of, kiel, in, 1912, and, the, family, moved, into, the, director, s, apartment, at, the, institute, initially, he, was, schooled, privately, by, a, professional, teacher, as, part, of, a, group, of, eight, girls, and, boys, the, family, moved, again, in, 1915, when, his, father, became, the, head, of, the, new, institute, of, physiology, at, the, goethe, university, frankfurt, bethe, attended, the, goethe, gymnasium, in, frankfurt, germany, his, education, was, interrupted, in, 1916, when, he, contracted, tuberculosis, and, he, was, sent, to, bad, kreuznach, to, recuperate, by, 1917, he, had, recovered, sufficiently, to, attend, the, local, realschule, and, the, following, year, he, was, sent, to, the, odenwaldschule, a, private, coeducational, boarding, school, he, attended, the, goethe, gymnasium, again, for, his, final, three, years, of, secondary, schooling, from, 1922, to, 1924, having, passed, his, abitur, bethe, entered, the, university, of, frankfurt, in, 1924, he, decided, to, major, in, chemistry, the, instruction, in, physics, was, poor, and, while, there, were, distinguished, mathematicians, in, frankfurt, such, as, carl, ludwig, siegel, and, otto, sz, sz, bethe, disliked, their, approaches, which, presented, mathematics, without, reference, to, the, other, sciences, bethe, found, that, he, was, a, poor, experimentalist, who, destroyed, his, lab, coat, by, spilling, sulfuric, acid, on, it, but, he, found, the, advanced, physics, taught, by, the, associate, professor, walter, gerlach, more, interesting, gerlach, left, in, 1925, and, was, replaced, by, karl, meissner, who, advised, bethe, that, he, should, go, to, a, university, with, a, better, school, of, theoretical, physics, specifically, the, university, of, munich, where, he, could, study, under, arnold, sommerfeld, bethe, entered, the, university, of, munich, in, april, 1926, where, sommerfeld, took, him, on, as, a, student, on, meissner, s, recommendation, sommerfeld, taught, an, advanced, course, on, differential, equations, in, physics, which, bethe, enjoyed, because, he, was, such, a, renowned, scholar, sommerfeld, frequently, received, advance, copies, of, scientific, papers, which, he, put, up, for, discussion, at, weekly, evening, seminars, when, bethe, arrived, sommerfeld, had, just, received, erwin, schr, dinger, s, papers, on, wave, mechanics, for, his, phd, thesis, sommerfeld, suggested, that, bethe, examine, electron, diffraction, in, crystals, as, a, starting, point, sommerfeld, suggested, paul, ewald, s, 1914, paper, on, x, ray, diffraction, in, crystals, bethe, later, recalled, that, he, became, too, ambitious, and, in, pursuit, of, greater, accuracy, his, calculations, became, unnecessarily, complicated, when, he, met, wolfgang, pauli, for, the, first, time, pauli, told, him, after, sommerfeld, s, tales, about, you, i, had, expected, much, better, from, you, than, your, thesis, i, guess, from, pauli, bethe, later, recalled, that, was, a, compliment, after, bethe, received, his, doctorate, erwin, madelung, offered, him, an, assistantship, in, frankfurt, and, in, september, 1928, bethe, moved, in, with, his, father, who, had, recently, divorced, his, mother, his, father, had, met, vera, congehl, earlier, that, year, and, married, her, in, 1929, they, had, two, children, doris, born, in, 1933, and, klaus, born, in, 1934, bethe, did, not, find, the, work, in, frankfurt, very, stimulating, and, in, 1929, he, accepted, an, offer, from, ewald, at, the, technische, hochschule, in, stuttgart, while, there, he, wrote, what, he, considered, to, be, his, greatest, paper, zur, theorie, des, durchgangs, schneller, korpuskularstrahlen, durch, materie, the, theory, of, the, passage, of, fast, corpuscular, rays, through, matter, starting, from, max, born, s, interpretation, of, the, schr, dinger, equation, bethe, produced, a, simplified, formula, for, collision, problems, using, a, fourier, transform, which, is, known, today, as, the, bethe, formula, he, submitted, this, paper, for, his, habilitation, in, 1930, sommerfeld, recommended, bethe, for, a, rockefeller, foundation, travelling, scholarship, in, 1929, this, provided, 150, a, month, about, 3, 000, in, 2023, dollars, to, study, abroad, in, 1930, bethe, chose, to, do, postdoctoral, work, at, the, cavendish, laboratory, at, the, university, of, cambridge, in, england, where, he, worked, under, the, supervision, of, ralph, fowler, at, the, request, of, patrick, blackett, who, was, working, with, cloud, chambers, bethe, created, a, relativistic, version, of, the, bethe, formula, bethe, was, known, for, his, sense, of, humor, and, with, guido, beck, and, wolfgang, riezler, two, other, postdoctoral, research, fellows, created, a, hoax, paper, on, the, quantum, theory, of, the, temperature, of, absolute, zero, where, he, calculated, the, fine, structure, constant, from, the, absolute, zero, temperature, in, celsius, units, the, paper, poked, fun, at, a, certain, class, of, papers, in, theoretical, physics, of, the, day, which, were, purely, speculative, and, based, on, spurious, numerical, arguments, such, as, arthur, eddington, s, attempts, to, explain, the, value, of, the, fine, structure, constant, from, fundamental, quantities, in, an, earlier, paper, they, were, forced, to, issue, an, apology, for, the, second, half, of, his, scholarship, bethe, chose, to, go, to, enrico, fermi, s, laboratory, in, rome, in, february, 1931, he, was, greatly, impressed, by, fermi, and, regretted, that, he, had, not, gone, to, rome, first, bethe, developed, the, bethe, ansatz, a, method, for, finding, the, exact, solutions, for, the, eigenvalues, and, eigenvectors, of, certain, one, dimensional, quantum, many, body, models, he, was, influenced, by, fermi, s, simplicity, and, sommerfeld, s, rigor, in, approaching, problems, and, these, qualities, influenced, his, own, later, research, the, rockefeller, foundation, offered, an, extension, of, bethe, s, fellowship, allowing, him, to, return, to, italy, in, 1932, in, the, meantime, bethe, worked, for, sommerfeld, in, munich, as, a, privatdozent, since, bethe, was, fluent, in, english, sommerfeld, had, bethe, supervise, all, his, english, speaking, postdoctoral, fellows, including, lloyd, p, smith, from, cornell, university, bethe, accepted, a, request, from, karl, scheel, to, write, an, article, for, the, handbuch, der, physik, on, the, quantum, mechanics, of, hydrogen, and, helium, reviewing, the, article, decades, later, robert, bacher, and, victor, weisskopf, noted, that, it, was, unusual, in, the, depth, and, breadth, of, its, treatment, of, the, subject, that, required, very, little, updating, for, the, 1959, edition, bethe, was, then, asked, by, sommerfeld, to, help, him, with, the, handbuch, article, on, electrons, in, metals, the, article, covered, the, basis, of, what, is, now, called, solid, state, physics, bethe, took, a, very, new, field, and, provided, a, clear, coherent, and, complete, coverage, of, it, his, work, on, the, handbuch, articles, occupied, most, of, his, time, in, rome, but, he, also, co, wrote, a, paper, with, fermi, on, another, new, field, quantum, electrodynamics, describing, the, relativistic, interactions, of, charged, particles, in, 1932, bethe, accepted, an, appointment, as, an, assistant, professor, at, the, university, of, t, bingen, where, hans, geiger, was, the, professor, of, experimental, physics, one, of, the, first, laws, passed, by, the, new, nazi, government, was, the, law, for, the, restoration, of, the, professional, civil, service, due, to, his, jewish, background, bethe, was, dismissed, from, his, job, at, the, university, which, was, a, government, post, geiger, refused, to, help, but, sommerfeld, immediately, gave, bethe, back, his, fellowship, at, munich, sommerfeld, spent, much, of, the, summer, term, of, 1933, finding, places, for, jewish, students, and, colleagues, bethe, left, germany, in, 1933, moving, to, england, after, receiving, an, offer, for, a, position, as, lecturer, at, the, university, of, manchester, for, a, year, through, sommerfeld, s, connection, to, william, lawrence, bragg, he, moved, in, with, his, friend, rudolf, peierls, and, peierls, wife, genia, peierls, was, a, fellow, german, physicist, who, had, also, been, barred, from, academic, positions, in, germany, because, he, was, jewish, this, meant, that, bethe, had, someone, to, speak, to, in, german, and, he, did, not, have, to, eat, english, food, their, relationship, was, professional, as, well, as, personal, peierls, aroused, bethe, s, interest, in, nuclear, physics, after, james, chadwick, and, maurice, goldhaber, discovered, the, photodisintegration, of, deuterium, chadwick, challenged, bethe, and, peierls, to, come, up, with, a, theoretical, explanation, of, this, phenomenon, this, they, did, on, the, four, hour, train, ride, from, cambridge, back, to, manchester, bethe, would, investigate, further, in, the, years, ahead, in, 1933, the, physics, department, at, cornell, university, new, york, was, looking, for, a, new, theoretical, physicist, and, lloyd, smith, strongly, recommended, bethe, this, was, supported, by, bragg, who, was, visiting, cornell, at, the, time, in, august, 1934, cornell, offered, bethe, a, position, as, an, acting, assistant, professor, bethe, had, already, accepted, a, fellowship, for, a, year, to, work, with, nevill, mott, at, the, university, of, bristol, for, a, semester, but, cornell, agreed, to, let, him, start, in, the, spring, of, 1935, before, leaving, for, the, united, states, he, visited, the, niels, bohr, institute, in, copenhagen, in, september, 1934, where, he, proposed, to, hilde, levi, who, accepted, the, match, was, opposed, by, bethe, s, mother, who, despite, having, a, jewish, background, did, not, want, him, to, marry, a, jewish, woman, a, few, days, before, their, wedding, date, in, december, bethe, broke, off, their, engagement, niels, bohr, and, james, franck, were, so, shocked, by, this, action, by, bethe, that, he, was, not, invited, to, the, institute, again, until, after, world, war, ii, bethe, arrived, in, the, united, states, in, february, 1935, and, joined, the, faculty, at, cornell, university, on, a, salary, of, 3, 000, bethe, s, appointment, was, part, of, a, deliberate, effort, on, the, part, of, the, new, head, of, its, physics, department, roswell, clifton, gibbs, to, move, into, nuclear, physics, gibbs, had, hired, stanley, livingston, who, had, worked, with, ernest, lawrence, to, build, a, cyclotron, at, cornell, to, complete, the, team, cornell, needed, an, experimentalist, and, on, the, advice, of, bethe, and, livingston, recruited, robert, bacher, bethe, received, requests, to, visit, columbia, university, from, isidor, isaac, rabi, princeton, university, from, edward, condon, university, of, rochester, from, lee, dubridge, purdue, university, from, karl, lark, horovitz, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, from, francis, wheeler, loomis, and, harvard, university, from, john, hasbrouck, van, vleck, gibbs, moved, to, prevent, bethe, from, being, poached, by, having, him, appointed, as, a, regular, assistant, professor, in, 1936, with, an, assurance, that, promotion, to, professor, would, soon, follow, together, with, bacher, and, livingston, bethe, published, a, series, of, three, articles, which, summarized, most, of, what, was, known, on, the, subject, of, nuclear, physics, until, that, time, an, account, that, became, known, informally, as, bethe, s, bible, it, remained, the, standard, work, on, the, subject, for, many, years, in, this, account, he, also, continued, where, others, left, off, filling, in, gaps, in, the, older, literature, loomis, offered, bethe, a, full, professorship, at, the, university, of, illinois, at, urbana, champaign, but, cornell, matched, the, position, offered, and, the, salary, of, 6, 000, he, wrote, to, his, mother, i, am, about, the, leading, theoretician, in, america, that, does, not, mean, the, best, wigner, is, certainly, better, and, oppenheimer, and, teller, probably, just, as, good, but, i, do, more, and, talk, more, and, that, counts, too, on, march, 17, 1938, bethe, attended, the, carnegie, institute, and, george, washington, university, s, fourth, annual, washington, conference, of, theoretical, physics, there, were, only, 34, invited, attendees, but, they, included, gregory, breit, subrahmanyan, chandrasekhar, george, gamow, donald, menzel, john, von, neumann, bengt, str, mgren, edward, teller, and, merle, tuve, bethe, initially, declined, the, invitation, to, attend, because, the, conference, s, topic, stellar, energy, generation, did, not, interest, him, but, teller, persuaded, him, to, go, at, the, conference, str, mgren, detailed, what, was, known, about, the, temperature, density, and, chemical, composition, of, the, sun, and, challenged, the, physicists, to, come, up, with, an, explanation, gamow, and, carl, friedrich, von, weizs, cker, had, proposed, in, a, 1937, paper, that, the, sun, s, energy, was, the, result, of, a, proton, proton, chain, reaction, but, this, did, not, account, for, the, observation, of, elements, heavier, than, helium, by, the, end, of, the, conference, bethe, working, in, collaboration, with, charles, critchfield, had, come, up, with, a, series, of, subsequent, nuclear, reactions, that, explained, how, the, sun, shines, that, this, did, not, explain, the, processes, in, heavier, stars, was, not, overlooked, at, the, time, there, were, doubts, about, whether, the, proton, proton, cycle, described, the, processes, in, the, sun, but, more, recent, measurements, of, the, sun, s, core, temperature, and, luminosity, show, that, it, does, when, he, returned, to, cornell, bethe, studied, the, relevant, nuclear, reactions, and, reaction, cross, sections, leading, to, his, discovery, of, the, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, cycle, cno, cycle, the, two, papers, one, on, the, proton, proton, cycle, co, authored, with, critchfield, and, the, other, on, the, carbon, oxygen, nitrogen, cno, cycle, were, sent, to, the, physical, review, for, publication, after, kristallnacht, bethe, s, mother, had, become, afraid, to, remain, in, germany, taking, advantage, of, her, strasbourg, origin, she, was, able, to, emigrate, to, the, united, states, in, june, 1939, on, the, french, quota, rather, than, the, german, one, which, was, full, bethe, s, graduate, student, robert, marshak, noted, that, the, new, york, academy, of, sciences, was, offering, a, 500, prize, for, the, best, unpublished, paper, on, the, topic, of, solar, and, stellar, energy, so, bethe, in, need, of, 250, to, release, his, mother, s, furniture, withdrew, the, cno, cycle, paper, and, sent, it, in, to, the, new, york, academy, of, sciences, it, won, the, prize, and, bethe, gave, marshak, 50, finder, s, fee, and, used, 250, to, release, his, mother, s, furniture, the, paper, was, subsequently, published, in, the, physical, review, in, march, it, was, a, breakthrough, in, the, understanding, of, the, stars, and, would, win, bethe, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1967, in, 2002, at, age, 96, bethe, sent, a, handwritten, note, to, john, n, bahcall, congratulating, him, on, the, use, of, solar, neutrino, observations, to, show, that, the, cno, cycle, accounts, for, approximately, 7, of, the, sun, s, energy, the, neutrino, observations, had, started, with, raymond, davis, jr, whose, experiment, was, based, on, bahcall, s, calculations, and, encouragement, and, the, note, led, to, davis, s, receiving, a, share, of, the, 2002, nobel, prize, bethe, married, rose, ewald, the, daughter, of, paul, ewald, on, september, 13, 1939, in, a, simple, civil, ceremony, she, had, emigrated, to, the, united, states, and, was, a, student, at, duke, university, and, they, met, while, bethe, was, lecturing, there, in, 1937, they, had, two, children, henry, and, monica, henry, was, a, contract, bridge, expert, and, former, husband, of, kitty, munson, cooper, bethe, became, a, naturalized, citizen, of, the, united, states, in, march, 1941, writing, to, sommerfeld, in, 1947, bethe, confided, that, i, am, much, more, at, home, in, america, than, i, ever, was, in, germany, as, if, i, was, born, in, germany, only, by, mistake, and, only, came, to, my, true, homeland, at, 28, when, the, second, world, war, began, bethe, wanted, to, contribute, to, the, war, effort, but, was, unable, to, work, on, classified, projects, until, he, became, a, citizen, following, the, advice, of, the, caltech, aerodynamicist, theodore, von, k, rm, n, bethe, collaborated, with, his, friend, edward, teller, on, a, theory, of, shock, waves, that, are, generated, by, the, passage, of, a, projectile, through, a, gas, bethe, considered, it, one, of, their, most, influential, papers, he, also, worked, on, a, theory, of, armor, penetration, which, was, immediately, classified, by, the, army, thus, making, it, impossible, for, bethe, who, was, not, an, american, citizen, at, the, time, to, access, further, research, on, the, theory, after, receiving, security, clearance, in, december, 1941, bethe, joined, the, mit, radiation, laboratory, where, he, invented, the, bethe, hole, directional, coupler, which, is, used, in, microwave, waveguides, such, as, those, used, in, radar, sets, in, chicago, in, june, 1942, and, then, in, july, at, the, university, of, california, berkeley, he, participated, in, a, series, of, meetings, at, the, invitation, of, robert, oppenheimer, which, discussed, the, first, designs, for, the, atomic, bomb, they, went, over, the, preliminary, calculations, by, robert, serber, stan, frankel, and, others, and, discussed, the, possibilities, of, using, uranium, 235, and, plutonium, teller, then, raised, the, prospect, of, a, thermonuclear, device, teller, s, super, bomb, at, one, point, teller, asked, if, the, nitrogen, in, the, atmosphere, could, be, set, alight, it, fell, to, bethe, and, emil, konopinski, to, perform, the, calculations, demonstrating, the, virtual, impossibility, of, such, an, occurrence, the, fission, bomb, had, to, be, done, he, later, recalled, because, the, germans, were, presumably, doing, it, when, oppenheimer, was, put, in, charge, of, forming, a, secret, weapons, design, laboratory, los, alamos, he, appointed, bethe, director, of, the, t, theoretical, division, the, laboratory, s, smallest, but, most, prestigious, division, this, move, irked, the, equally, qualified, but, more, difficult, to, manage, teller, and, felix, bloch, who, had, coveted, the, job, a, series, of, disagreements, between, bethe, and, teller, between, february, and, june, 1944, over, the, relative, priority, of, super, research, led, to, teller, s, group, being, removed, from, t, division, and, placed, directly, under, oppenheimer, in, september, it, became, part, of, fermi, s, new, f, division, bethe, s, work, at, los, alamos, included, calculating, the, critical, mass, and, efficiency, of, uranium, 235, and, the, multiplication, of, nuclear, fission, in, an, exploding, atomic, bomb, along, with, richard, feynman, he, developed, a, formula, for, calculating, the, bomb, s, explosive, yield, after, august, 1944, when, the, laboratory, was, reorganized, and, reoriented, to, solve, the, problem, of, the, implosion, of, the, plutonium, bomb, bethe, spent, much, of, his, time, studying, the, hydrodynamic, aspects, of, implosion, a, job, that, he, continued, into, 1944, in, 1945, he, worked, on, the, neutron, initiator, and, later, on, radiation, propagation, from, an, exploding, atomic, bomb, the, trinity, nuclear, test, validated, the, accuracy, of, t, division, s, results, when, it, was, detonated, in, the, new, mexico, desert, on, july, 16, 1945, bethe, s, immediate, concern, was, for, its, efficient, operation, and, not, its, moral, implications, he, is, reported, to, have, commented, i, am, not, a, philosopher, after, the, war, bethe, argued, that, a, crash, project, for, the, hydrogen, bomb, should, not, be, attempted, although, after, president, harry, truman, announced, the, beginning, of, such, a, project, and, the, outbreak, of, the, korean, war, bethe, signed, up, and, played, a, key, role, in, the, weapon, s, development, although, he, saw, the, project, through, to, its, end, bethe, had, hoped, that, it, would, be, impossible, to, create, the, hydrogen, bomb, he, later, remarked, in, 1968, on, the, apparent, contradiction, in, his, stance, having, first, opposed, the, development, of, the, weapon, and, later, helping, to, create, it, just, a, few, months, before, the, korean, war, had, broken, out, and, for, the, first, time, i, saw, direct, confrontation, with, the, communists, it, was, too, disturbing, the, cold, war, looked, as, if, it, were, about, to, get, hot, i, knew, then, i, had, to, reverse, my, earlier, position, if, i, did, not, work, on, the, bomb, somebody, else, would, and, i, had, thought, if, i, were, around, los, alamos, i, might, still, be, a, force, for, disarmament, so, i, agreed, to, join, in, developing, the, h, bomb, it, seemed, quite, logical, but, sometimes, i, wish, i, were, a, more, consistent, idealist, as, for, his, own, role, in, the, project, and, its, relation, to, the, dispute, over, who, was, responsible, for, the, design, bethe, later, said, that, after, the, h, bomb, was, made, reporters, started, to, call, teller, the, father, of, the, h, bomb, for, the, sake, of, history, i, think, it, is, more, precise, to, say, that, ulam, is, the, father, because, he, provided, the, seed, and, teller, is, the, mother, because, he, remained, with, the, child, as, for, me, i, guess, i, am, the, midwife, in, 1954, bethe, testified, on, behalf, of, j, robert, oppenheimer, during, the, oppenheimer, security, hearing, specifically, bethe, argued, that, oppenheimer, s, stances, against, developing, the, hydrogen, bomb, in, the, late, 1940s, had, not, hindered, its, development, a, topic, which, was, seen, as, a, key, motivating, factor, behind, the, hearing, bethe, contended, that, the, developments, that, led, to, the, successful, teller, ulam, design, were, a, matter, of, serendipity, and, not, a, question, of, manpower, or, logical, development, of, previously, existing, ideas, during, the, hearing, bethe, and, his, wife, also, tried, hard, to, persuade, edward, teller, against, testifying, however, teller, did, not, agree, and, his, testimony, played, a, major, role, in, the, revocation, of, oppenheimer, s, security, clearance, while, bethe, and, teller, had, been, on, very, good, terms, during, the, prewar, years, the, conflict, between, them, during, the, manhattan, project, and, especially, during, the, oppenheimer, episode, permanently, marred, their, relationship, after, the, war, ended, bethe, returned, to, cornell, in, june, 1947, he, participated, in, the, shelter, island, conference, sponsored, by, the, national, academy, of, sciences, and, held, at, the, ram, s, head, inn, on, shelter, island, new, york, the, conference, on, the, foundations, of, quantum, mechanics, was, the, first, major, physics, conference, held, after, the, war, it, was, a, chance, for, american, physicists, to, come, together, pick, up, where, they, had, left, off, before, the, war, and, establish, the, direction, of, post, war, research, a, major, talking, point, at, the, conference, was, the, discovery, by, willis, lamb, and, his, graduate, student, robert, retherford, shortly, before, the, conference, began, that, one, of, the, two, possible, quantum, states, of, hydrogen, atoms, had, slightly, more, energy, than, that, predicted, by, the, theory, of, paul, dirac, this, became, known, as, the, lamb, shift, oppenheimer, and, weisskopf, suggested, that, this, was, a, result, of, quantum, fluctuations, of, the, electromagnetic, field, which, gave, the, electron, more, energy, according, to, pre, war, quantum, electrodynamics, qed, the, energy, of, the, electron, consisted, of, the, bare, energy, it, had, when, uncoupled, from, an, electromagnetic, field, and, the, self, energy, resulting, from, the, electromagnetic, coupling, but, both, were, unobservable, since, the, electromagnetic, field, cannot, be, switched, off, qed, gave, infinite, values, for, the, self, energies, but, the, lamb, shift, showed, that, they, were, both, real, and, finite, hans, kramers, proposed, renormalization, as, a, solution, but, no, one, knew, how, to, do, the, calculation, bethe, managed, to, perform, the, calculation, on, the, train, from, new, york, to, schenectady, where, he, was, working, for, general, electric, he, did, so, by, realising, that, it, was, a, non, relativistic, process, which, greatly, simplified, the, calculation, the, bare, energy, was, easily, removed, as, it, was, already, included, in, the, observed, mass, of, the, electron, the, self, energy, term, now, increased, logarithmically, instead, of, linearly, making, it, mathematically, convergent, bethe, arrived, at, a, value, for, the, lamb, shift, of, 1040, mhz, extremely, close, to, that, obtained, experimentally, by, lamb, and, retherford, his, paper, published, in, the, physical, review, in, august, 1947, was, only, three, pages, long, and, contained, just, twelve, mathematical, equations, but, was, enormously, influential, it, had, been, presumed, that, the, infinities, indicated, that, qed, was, fundamentally, flawed, and, that, a, new, radical, theory, was, required, bethe, demonstrated, that, this, was, not, necessary, one, of, bethe, s, most, famous, papers, is, one, he, never, wrote, the, 1948, alpher, bethe, gamow, paper, george, gamow, added, bethe, s, name, in, absentia, without, consulting, him, knowing, that, bethe, would, not, mind, and, against, ralph, alpher, s, wishes, this, was, apparently, a, reflection, of, gamow, s, sense, of, humor, wanting, to, have, a, paper, title, that, would, sound, like, the, first, three, letters, of, the, greek, alphabet, as, one, of, the, physical, review, s, reviewers, bethe, saw, the, manuscript, and, struck, out, the, words, in, absentia, bethe, believed, that, the, atomic, nucleus, was, like, a, quantum, liquid, drop, he, investigated, the, nuclear, matter, problem, by, considering, the, work, conducted, by, keith, brueckner, on, perturbation, theory, working, with, jeffrey, goldstone, he, produced, a, solution, for, the, case, where, there, was, an, infinite, hard, core, potential, then, working, with, baird, brandow, and, albert, petschek, he, came, up, with, an, approximation, that, converted, the, scattering, equation, into, an, easily, solved, differential, equation, this, then, led, him, to, the, bethe, faddeev, equation, a, generalisation, of, ludvig, faddeev, s, approach, to, three, body, scattering, he, then, used, these, techniques, to, examine, the, neutron, stars, which, have, densities, similar, to, those, of, nuclei, bethe, continued, to, do, research, on, supernovae, neutron, stars, black, holes, and, other, problems, in, theoretical, astrophysics, into, his, late, nineties, in, doing, this, he, collaborated, with, gerald, e, brown, of, stony, brook, university, in, 1978, brown, proposed, that, they, collaborate, on, supernovae, these, were, reasonably, well, understood, by, this, time, but, the, calculations, were, still, a, problem, using, techniques, honed, from, decades, of, working, with, nuclear, physics, and, some, experience, with, calculations, involving, nuclear, explosions, bethe, tackled, the, problems, involved, in, stellar, gravitational, collapse, and, the, way, in, which, various, factors, affected, a, supernova, explosion, once, again, he, was, able, to, reduce, the, problem, to, a, set, of, differential, equations, and, to, solve, them, at, age, 85, bethe, wrote, an, important, article, about, the, solar, neutrino, problem, in, which, he, helped, establish, the, conversion, mechanism, for, electron, neutrinos, into, muon, neutrinos, proposed, by, stanislav, mikheyev, alexei, smirnov, and, lincoln, wolfenstein, to, explain, a, vexing, discrepancy, between, theory, and, experiment, bethe, argued, that, physics, beyond, the, standard, model, was, required, to, understand, the, solar, neutrino, problem, because, it, presumed, that, neutrinos, have, no, mass, and, therefore, cannot, metamorphosize, into, each, other, whereas, the, msw, effect, required, this, to, occur, bethe, hoped, that, corroborating, evidence, would, be, found, by, the, sudbury, neutrino, observatory, sno, in, ontario, by, his, 90th, birthday, but, he, did, not, get, the, call, from, sno, until, june, 2001, when, he, was, nearly, 95, in, 1996, kip, thorne, approached, bethe, and, brown, about, ligo, the, laser, interferometer, gravitational, wave, observatory, designed, to, detect, the, gravitational, waves, from, merging, neutron, stars, and, black, holes, since, bethe, and, brown, were, good, at, calculating, things, that, could, not, be, seen, could, they, look, at, the, mergers, the, 90, year, old, bethe, quickly, became, enthused, and, soon, began, the, required, calculations, the, result, was, a, 1998, paper, on, the, evolution, of, binary, compact, objects, which, merge, which, brown, regarded, as, the, best, that, the, two, produced, together, in, 1968, bethe, along, with, ibm, physicist, richard, garwin, published, an, article, criticising, in, detail, the, anti, icbm, defense, system, proposed, by, the, department, of, defense, the, two, physicists, described, in, the, article, that, nearly, any, measure, taken, by, the, united, states, would, be, easily, thwarted, with, the, deployment, of, relatively, simple, decoys, bethe, was, one, of, the, primary, voices, in, the, scientific, community, behind, the, signing, of, the, 1963, partial, test, ban, treaty, prohibiting, further, atmospheric, testing, of, nuclear, weapons, during, the, 1980s, and, 1990s, bethe, campaigned, for, the, peaceful, use, of, nuclear, energy, after, the, chernobyl, disaster, bethe, was, part, of, a, committee, of, experts, who, analysed, the, incident, they, concluded, that, the, reactor, suffered, from, a, fundamentally, faulty, design, and, also, that, human, error, had, contributed, significantly, to, the, accident, my, colleagues, and, i, established, he, explained, that, the, chernobyl, disaster, tells, us, about, the, deficiencies, of, the, soviet, political, and, administrative, system, rather, than, about, problems, with, nuclear, power, throughout, his, life, bethe, remained, a, strong, advocate, for, electricity, from, nuclear, energy, which, he, described, in, 1977, as, a, necessity, not, merely, an, option, in, the, 1980s, he, and, other, physicists, opposed, the, strategic, defense, initiative, missile, system, conceived, by, the, ronald, reagan, administration, in, 1995, at, the, age, of, 88, bethe, wrote, an, open, letter, calling, on, all, scientists, to, cease, and, desist, from, working, on, any, aspect, of, nuclear, weapons, development, and, manufacture, in, 2004, he, joined, 47, other, nobel, laureates, in, signing, a, letter, endorsing, john, kerry, for, president, of, the, united, states, as, someone, who, would, restore, science, to, its, appropriate, place, in, government, historian, gregg, herken, wrote, when, oppenheimer, died, oppie, s, long, time, friend, hans, bethe, assumed, the, mantle, of, the, scientist, of, conscience, in, this, country, like, jefferson, and, adams, teller, and, bethe, would, live, on, into, the, new, century, which, they, and, their, colleagues, had, done, so, much, to, shape, bethe, s, hobbies, included, a, passion, for, stamp, collecting, he, loved, the, outdoors, and, was, an, enthusiastic, hiker, all, his, life, exploring, the, alps, and, the, rockies, he, died, in, his, home, in, ithaca, new, york, on, march, 6, 2005, of, congestive, heart, failure, he, was, survived, by, his, wife, rose, ewald, bethe, and, their, two, children, at, the, time, of, his, death, he, was, the, john, wendell, anderson, professor, of, physics, emeritus, at, cornell, university, bethe, received, numerous, honors, and, awards, in, his, lifetime, and, afterward, he, became, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1947, and, that, year, he, also, received, the, national, academy, of, sciences, s, henry, draper, medal, and, was, elected, to, the, american, philosophical, society, he, was, awarded, the, max, planck, medal, in, 1955, the, franklin, medal, in, 1959, the, royal, astronomical, society, eddington, medal, and, the, united, states, atomic, energy, commission, enrico, fermi, award, in, 1961, the, rumford, prize, in, 1963, the, nobel, prize, in, physics, in, 1967, the, national, medal, of, science, in, 1975, the, oersted, medal, in, 1993, the, bruce, medal, in, 2001, and, posthumously, in, 2005, the, benjamin, franklin, medal, for, distinguished, achievement, in, the, sciences, by, the, american, philosophical, society, bethe, was, elected, foreign, member, of, the, royal, society, formemrs, in, 1957, and, he, gave, the, 1993, bakerian, lecture, at, the, royal, society, on, the, mechanism, of, supernovae, in, 1978, he, was, elected, a, member, of, the, german, academy, of, sciences, leopoldina, cornell, named, the, third, of, five, new, residential, colleges, each, of, which, is, named, after, a, distinguished, former, member, of, the, cornell, faculty, as, the, hans, bethe, house, after, him, similarly, named, after, him, is, the, hans, bethe, center, 322, fourth, street, ne, washington, d, c, home, to, the, council, for, a, livable, world, where, bethe, was, a, longtime, board, member, as, well, as, the, bethe, center, for, theoretical, physics, at, university, of, bonn, in, germany, an, asteroid, 30828, bethe, that, was, discovered, in, 1990, was, named, after, him, the, american, physical, society, hans, bethe, prize, was, named, after, him, as, well, bethe, was, portrayed, by, matthew, guinness, in, the, 1980, tv, miniseries, oppenheimer, and, by, gustaf, skarsg, rd, in, the, 2023, film, oppenheimer, in, cities, in, flight,
