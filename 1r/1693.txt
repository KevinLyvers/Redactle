miles, from, valley, forge, audubon, lived, with, the, tenants, in, the, two, story, stone, house, in, an, area, that, he, considered, a, paradise, hunting, fishing, drawing, and, music, occupied, my, every, moment, cares, i, knew, not, and, cared, naught, about, them, studying, his, surroundings, audubon, quickly, learned, the, ornithologist, s, rule, which, he, wrote, down, as, the, nature, of, the, place, whether, high, or, low, moist, or, dry, whether, sloping, north, or, south, or, bearing, tall, trees, or, low, shrubs, generally, gives, hint, as, to, its, inhabitants, his, father, hoped, that, the, lead, mines, on, the, property, could, be, commercially, developed, as, lead, was, an, essential, component, of, bullets, this, could, provide, his, son, with, a, profitable, occupation, at, mill, grove, audubon, met, the, owner, of, the, nearby, fatland, ford, estate, william, bakewell, and, his, daughter, lucy, bakewell, audubon, set, about, to, study, american, birds, determined, to, illustrate, his, findings, in, a, more, realistic, manner, than, most, artists, did, then, he, began, drawing, and, painting, birds, and, recording, their, behavior, after, an, accidental, fall, into, a, creek, audubon, contracted, a, severe, fever, he, was, nursed, and, recovered, at, fatland, ford, with, lucy, at, his, side, risking, conscription, in, france, audubon, returned, in, 1805, to, see, his, father, and, ask, permission, to, marry, he, also, needed, to, discuss, family, business, plans, while, there, he, met, the, naturalist, and, physician, charles, marie, d, orbigny, who, improved, audubon, s, taxidermy, skills, and, taught, him, scientific, methods, of, research, although, his, return, ship, was, overtaken, by, an, english, privateer, audubon, and, his, hidden, gold, coins, survived, the, encounter, audubon, resumed, his, bird, studies, and, created, his, own, nature, museum, perhaps, inspired, by, the, great, museum, of, natural, history, created, by, charles, willson, peale, in, philadelphia, peale, s, bird, exhibits, were, considered, scientifically, advanced, audubon, s, room, was, brimming, with, birds, eggs, stuffed, raccoons, and, opossums, fish, snakes, and, other, creatures, he, had, become, proficient, at, specimen, preparation, and, taxidermy, deeming, the, mining, venture, too, risky, with, his, father, s, approval, audubon, sold, part, of, the, mill, grove, farm, including, the, house, and, mine, and, retaining, some, land, for, investment, in, volume, 2, of, ornithological, biography, 1834, audubon, told, a, story, from, his, childhood, 30, years, after, the, events, reportedly, took, place, that, has, since, garnered, him, the, label, of, first, bird, bander, in, america, the, story, has, since, been, exposed, as, likely, apocryphal, in, the, spring, of, 1804, according, to, the, story, audubon, discovered, a, nest, of, the, pewee, flycatcher, now, known, as, the, eastern, phoebe, sayornis, phoebe, in, a, small, grotto, on, the, property, of, mill, grove, to, determine, whether, the, other, phoebes, on, the, property, were, descended, from, the, same, stock, audubon, 1834, 126, said, that, he, tied, silver, threads, to, the, legs, of, five, nestlings, i, took, the, whole, family, out, and, blew, off, the, exuviae, of, the, feathers, from, the, nest, i, attached, light, threads, to, their, legs, these, they, invariably, removed, either, with, their, bills, or, with, the, assistance, of, their, parents, i, renewed, them, however, until, i, found, the, little, fellows, habituated, to, them, and, at, last, when, they, were, about, to, leave, the, nest, i, fixed, a, light, silver, thread, to, the, leg, of, each, loose, enough, not, to, hurt, the, part, but, so, fastened, that, no, exertions, of, theirs, could, remove, it, he, also, said, that, he, had, ample, proof, afterwards, that, the, brood, of, young, pewees, raised, in, the, cave, returned, the, following, spring, and, established, themselves, farther, up, on, the, creek, and, among, the, outhouses, in, the, neighbourhood, having, caught, several, of, these, birds, on, the, nest, had, the, pleasure, of, finding, that, two, of, them, had, the, little, ring, on, the, leg, however, multiple, independent, primary, sources, including, original, dated, drawings, of, european, species, demonstrate, that, audubon, was, in, france, during, the, spring, of, 1805, not, in, pennsylvania, as, he, later, claimed, furthermore, audubon, s, claim, to, have, re, sighted, 2, out, of, 5, of, the, banded, phoebes, as, adults, i, e, a, 40, rate, of, natal, philopatry, has, not, been, replicated, by, modern, studies, with, much, larger, sample, sizes, e, g, 1, 6, rate, among, 549, nestlings, banded, and, 1, 3, rate, among, 217, nestlings, banded, these, facts, cast, doubt, on, the, truth, of, audubon, s, story, in, 1808, audubon, moved, to, kentucky, which, was, rapidly, being, settled, six, months, later, he, married, lucy, bakewell, at, her, family, estate, fatland, ford, pennsylvania, and, took, her, the, next, day, to, kentucky, the, two, shared, many, common, interests, and, began, to, explore, the, natural, world, around, them, though, their, finances, were, tenuous, the, audubons, started, a, family, they, had, two, sons, victor, gifford, 1809, 1860, and, john, woodhouse, audubon, 1812, 1862, and, two, daughters, who, died, while, still, young, lucy, at, two, years, 1815, 1817, and, rose, at, nine, months, 1819, 1820, both, sons, eventually, helped, publish, their, father, s, works, john, w, audubon, became, a, naturalist, writer, and, painter, in, his, own, right, audubon, and, jean, ferdinand, rozier, moved, their, merchant, business, partnership, west, at, various, stages, ending, ultimately, in, ste, genevieve, missouri, a, former, french, colonial, settlement, west, of, the, mississippi, river, and, south, of, st, louis, shipping, goods, ahead, audubon, and, rozier, started, a, general, store, in, louisville, kentucky, on, the, ohio, river, the, city, had, an, increasingly, important, slave, market, and, was, the, most, important, port, between, pittsburgh, and, new, orleans, soon, he, was, drawing, bird, specimens, again, he, regularly, burned, his, earlier, efforts, to, force, continuous, improvement, he, also, took, detailed, field, notes, to, document, his, drawings, due, to, rising, tensions, with, the, british, president, jefferson, ordered, an, embargo, on, british, trade, in, 1808, hurting, audubon, s, trading, business, in, 1810, audubon, moved, his, business, further, west, to, the, less, competitive, henderson, kentucky, area, he, and, his, small, family, took, over, an, abandoned, log, cabin, in, the, fields, and, forests, audubon, wore, typical, frontier, clothes, and, moccasins, having, a, ball, pouch, a, buffalo, horn, filled, with, gunpowder, a, butcher, knife, and, a, tomahawk, on, his, belt, he, frequently, turned, to, hunting, and, fishing, to, feed, his, family, as, business, was, slow, on, a, prospecting, trip, down, the, ohio, river, with, a, load, of, goods, audubon, joined, up, with, shawnee, and, osage, hunting, parties, learning, their, methods, drawing, specimens, by, the, bonfire, and, finally, parting, like, brethren, audubon, had, great, respect, for, native, americans, whenever, i, meet, indians, i, feel, the, greatness, of, our, creator, in, all, its, splendor, for, there, i, see, the, man, naked, from, his, hand, and, yet, free, from, acquired, sorrow, audubon, also, admired, the, skill, of, kentucky, riflemen, and, the, regulators, citizen, lawmen, who, created, a, kind, of, justice, on, the, kentucky, frontier, in, his, travel, notes, he, claims, to, have, encountered, daniel, boone, the, audubon, family, owned, several, slaves, while, he, was, in, henderson, until, they, needed, money, at, which, point, they, were, sold, audubon, was, condemned, contemporaneously, by, abolitionists, audubon, was, dismissive, of, abolitionists, in, both, the, us, and, the, united, kingdom, audubon, and, rozier, mutually, agreed, to, end, their, partnership, at, ste, genevieve, on, april, 6, 1811, audubon, had, decided, to, work, at, ornithology, and, art, and, wanted, to, return, to, lucy, and, their, son, in, kentucky, rozier, agreed, to, pay, audubon, us, 3, 000, equivalent, to, 54, 936, in, 2023, with, 1, 000, in, cash, and, the, balance, to, be, paid, over, time, the, terms, of, the, dissolution, of, the, partnership, include, those, by, audubon, i, john, audubon, having, this, day, mutual, consent, with, ferdinand, rozier, dissolved, and, forever, closed, the, partnership, and, firm, of, audubon, and, rozier, and, having, received, from, said, ferdinand, rozier, payment, and, notes, to, the, full, amount, of, my, part, of, the, goods, and, debts, of, the, late, firm, of, audubon, and, rozier, i, the, said, john, audubon, one, of, the, firm, aforesaid, do, hereby, release, and, forever, quit, claim, to, all, and, any, interest, which, i, have, or, may, have, in, the, stock, on, hand, and, debts, due, to, the, late, firm, of, audubon, and, rozier, assign, transfer, and, set, over, to, said, ferdinand, rozier, all, my, rights, titles, claims, and, interest, in, the, goods, merchandise, and, debts, due, to, the, late, firm, of, audubon, and, rozier, and, do, hereby, authorize, and, empower, him, for, my, part, to, collect, the, same, in, any, manner, what, ever, either, privately, or, by, suit, or, suits, in, law, or, equity, hereby, declaring, him, sole, and, absolute, proprietor, and, rightful, owner, of, all, goods, merchandise, and, debts, of, this, firm, aforesaid, as, completely, as, they, were, the, goods, and, property, of, the, late, firm, audubon, and, rozier, in, witness, thereof, i, have, set, my, hand, and, seal, this, sixth, day, of, april, 1811, john, audubon, ed, d, devillamonte, audubon, was, working, in, missouri, and, out, riding, when, the, 1811, new, madrid, earthquake, struck, when, audubon, reached, his, house, he, was, relieved, to, find, no, major, damage, but, the, area, was, shaken, by, aftershocks, for, months, the, quake, is, estimated, to, have, ranked, from, 8, 4, to, 8, 8, on, today, s, moment, magnitude, scale, of, severity, stronger, than, the, san, francisco, earthquake, of, 1906, which, is, estimated, at, 7, 8, audubon, writes, that, while, on, horseback, he, first, believed, the, distant, rumbling, to, be, the, sound, of, a, tornado, but, the, animal, knew, better, than, i, what, was, forthcoming, and, instead, of, going, faster, so, nearly, stopped, that, i, remarked, he, placed, one, foot, after, another, on, the, ground, with, as, much, precaution, as, if, walking, on, a, smooth, piece, of, ice, i, thought, he, had, suddenly, foundered, and, speaking, to, him, was, on, point, of, dismounting, and, leading, him, when, he, all, of, a, sudden, fell, a, groaning, piteously, hung, his, head, spread, out, his, forelegs, as, if, to, save, himself, from, falling, and, stood, stock, still, continuing, to, groan, i, thought, my, horse, was, about, to, die, and, would, have, sprung, from, his, back, had, a, minute, more, elapsed, but, as, that, instant, all, the, shrubs, and, trees, began, to, move, from, their, very, roots, the, ground, rose, and, fell, in, successive, furrows, like, the, ruffled, water, of, a, lake, and, i, became, bewildered, in, my, ideas, as, i, too, plainly, discovered, that, all, this, awful, commotion, was, the, result, of, an, earthquake, i, had, never, witnessed, anything, of, the, kind, before, although, like, every, person, i, knew, earthquakes, by, description, but, what, is, description, compared, to, reality, who, can, tell, the, sensations, which, i, experienced, when, i, found, myself, rocking, as, it, were, upon, my, horse, and, with, him, moving, to, and, fro, like, a, child, in, a, cradle, with, the, most, imminent, danger, around, me, he, noted, that, as, the, earthquake, retreated, the, air, was, filled, with, an, extremely, disagreeable, sulphurous, odor, during, a, visit, to, philadelphia, in, 1812, following, congress, declaration, of, war, against, great, britain, audubon, became, an, american, citizen, and, had, to, give, up, his, french, citizenship, after, his, return, to, kentucky, he, found, that, rats, had, eaten, his, entire, collection, of, more, than, 200, drawings, after, weeks, of, depression, he, took, to, the, field, again, determined, to, re, do, his, drawings, to, an, even, higher, standard, the, war, of, 1812, upset, audubon, s, plans, to, move, his, business, to, new, orleans, he, formed, a, partnership, with, lucy, s, brother, and, built, up, their, trade, in, henderson, between, 1812, and, the, panic, of, 1819, times, were, good, audubon, bought, land, and, slaves, founded, a, flour, mill, and, enjoyed, his, growing, family, after, 1819, audubon, went, bankrupt, and, was, thrown, into, jail, for, debt, the, little, money, he, earned, was, from, drawing, portraits, particularly, death, bed, sketches, greatly, esteemed, by, country, folk, before, photography, he, wrote, y, heart, was, sorely, heavy, for, scarcely, had, i, enough, to, keep, my, dear, ones, alive, and, yet, through, these, dark, days, i, was, being, led, to, the, development, of, the, talents, i, loved, audubon, worked, for, a, brief, time, as, the, first, paid, employee, of, the, western, history, society, now, known, as, the, museum, of, natural, history, at, the, cincinnati, museum, center, he, then, traveled, south, on, the, mississippi, with, his, gun, paintbox, and, assistant, joseph, mason, who, stayed, with, him, from, october, 1820, to, august, 1822, and, painted, the, plant, life, backgrounds, of, many, of, audubon, s, bird, studies, he, was, committed, to, find, and, paint, all, the, birds, of, north, america, for, eventual, publication, his, goal, was, to, surpass, the, earlier, ornithological, work, of, poet, naturalist, alexander, wilson, though, he, could, not, afford, to, buy, wilson, s, work, audubon, used, it, to, guide, him, when, he, had, access, to, a, copy, in, 1818, rafinesque, visited, kentucky, and, the, ohio, river, valley, to, study, fishes, and, was, a, guest, of, audubon, in, the, middle, of, the, night, rafinesque, noticed, a, bat, in, his, room, and, thought, it, was, a, new, species, he, happened, to, grab, audubon, s, favourite, violin, in, an, effort, to, knock, the, bat, down, resulting, in, the, destruction, of, the, violin, audubon, reportedly, took, revenge, by, showing, drawings, and, describing, some, fictitious, fishes, and, rodents, to, rafinesque, rafinesque, gave, scientific, names, to, some, of, these, fishes, in, his, ichthyologia, ohiensis, on, october, 12, 1820, audubon, traveled, into, mississippi, alabama, and, florida, in, search, of, ornithological, specimens, he, traveled, with, george, lehman, a, professional, swiss, landscape, artist, the, following, summer, he, moved, upriver, to, the, oakley, plantation, in, feliciana, parish, louisiana, where, he, taught, drawing, to, eliza, pirrie, the, young, daughter, of, the, owners, though, low, paying, the, job, was, ideal, as, it, afforded, him, much, time, to, roam, and, paint, in, the, woods, the, plantation, has, been, preserved, as, the, audubon, state, historic, site, and, is, located, at, 11788, highway, 965, between, jackson, and, st, francisville, audubon, called, his, future, work, the, birds, of, america, he, attempted, to, paint, one, page, each, day, painting, with, newly, discovered, technique, he, decided, his, earlier, works, were, inferior, and, re, did, them, he, hired, hunters, to, gather, specimens, for, him, audubon, realized, the, ambitious, project, would, take, him, away, from, his, family, for, months, at, a, time, audubon, sometimes, used, his, drawing, talent, to, trade, for, goods, or, sell, small, works, to, raise, cash, he, made, charcoal, portraits, on, demand, at, 5, each, and, gave, drawing, lessons, in, 1823, audubon, took, lessons, in, oil, painting, technique, from, john, steen, a, teacher, of, american, landscape, and, history, painter, thomas, cole, though, he, did, not, use, oils, much, for, his, bird, work, audubon, earned, good, money, painting, oil, portraits, for, patrons, along, the, mississippi, audubon, s, account, reveals, that, he, learned, oil, painting, in, december, 1822, from, jacob, stein, an, itinerant, portrait, artist, after, they, had, enjoyed, all, the, portrait, patronage, to, be, expected, in, natchez, mississippi, during, january, march, 1823, they, resolved, to, travel, together, as, perambulating, portrait, artists, during, this, period, 1822, 1823, audubon, also, worked, as, an, instructor, at, jefferson, college, in, washington, mississippi, lucy, became, the, steady, breadwinner, for, the, couple, and, their, two, young, sons, trained, as, a, teacher, she, conducted, classes, for, children, in, their, home, later, she, was, hired, as, a, local, teacher, in, louisiana, she, boarded, with, their, children, at, the, home, of, a, wealthy, plantation, owner, as, was, often, the, custom, of, the, time, in, 1824, audubon, returned, to, philadelphia, to, seek, a, publisher, for, his, bird, drawings, he, took, oil, painting, lessons, from, thomas, sully, and, met, charles, bonaparte, who, admired, his, work, and, recommended, he, go, to, europe, to, have, his, bird, drawings, engraved, audubon, was, nominated, for, membership, at, the, academy, of, natural, sciences, of, philadelphia, by, charles, alexandre, lesueur, reuben, haines, and, isaiah, lukens, on, july, 27, 1824, however, he, failed, to, gather, enough, support, and, his, nomination, was, rejected, by, vote, on, august, 31, 1824, around, the, same, time, accusations, of, scientific, misconduct, were, levied, by, alexander, lawson, and, others, with, his, wife, s, support, in, 1826, at, age, 41, audubon, took, his, growing, collection, of, work, to, england, he, sailed, from, new, orleans, to, liverpool, on, the, cotton, hauling, ship, delos, reaching, england, in, the, autumn, of, 1826, with, his, portfolio, of, over, 300, drawings, with, letters, of, introduction, to, prominent, englishmen, and, paintings, of, imaginary, species, including, the, bird, of, washington, audubon, gained, their, quick, attention, i, have, been, received, here, in, a, manner, not, to, be, expected, during, my, highest, enthusiastic, hopes, the, british, could, not, get, enough, of, audubon, s, images, of, backwoods, america, and, its, natural, attractions, he, met, with, great, acceptance, as, he, toured, around, england, and, scotland, and, was, lionized, as, the, american, woodsman, he, raised, enough, money, to, begin, publishing, his, the, birds, of, america, this, monumental, work, consists, of, 435, hand, colored, life, size, prints, of, 497, bird, species, made, from, engraved, copper, plates, of, various, sizes, depending, on, the, size, of, the, image, they, were, printed, on, sheets, measuring, about, 39, by, 26, inches, 990, by, 660, mm, the, work, illustrates, slightly, more, than, 700, north, american, bird, species, of, which, some, were, based, on, specimens, collected, by, fellow, ornithologist, john, kirk, townsend, on, his, journey, across, america, with, thomas, nuttall, in, 1834, as, part, of, nathaniel, jarvis, wyeth, s, second, expedition, across, the, rocky, mountains, to, the, pacific, ocean, the, pages, were, organized, for, artistic, effect, and, contrasting, interest, as, if, the, reader, were, taking, a, visual, tour, some, critics, thought, he, should, have, organized, the, plates, in, linnaean, order, as, befitting, a, serious, ornithological, treatise, the, first, and, perhaps, most, famous, plate, was, the, wild, turkey, among, the, earliest, plates, printed, was, the, bird, of, washington, which, generated, favorable, publicity, for, audubon, as, his, first, discovery, of, a, new, species, however, no, specimen, of, the, species, has, ever, been, found, and, research, published, in, 2020, suggests, that, this, plate, was, a, mixture, of, plagiarism, and, ornithological, fraud, the, cost, of, printing, the, entire, work, was, 115, 640, over, 2, 000, 000, today, paid, for, from, advance, subscriptions, exhibitions, oil, painting, commissions, and, animal, skins, which, audubon, hunted, and, sold, audubon, s, great, work, was, a, remarkable, accomplishment, it, took, more, than, 14, years, of, field, observations, and, drawings, plus, his, single, handed, management, and, promotion, of, the, project, to, make, it, a, success, a, reviewer, wrote, all, anxieties, and, fears, which, overshadowed, his, work, in, its, beginning, had, passed, away, the, prophecies, of, kind, but, overprudent, friends, who, did, not, understand, his, self, sustaining, energy, had, proved, untrue, the, malicious, hope, of, his, enemies, for, even, the, gentle, lover, of, nature, has, enemies, had, been, disappointed, he, had, secured, a, commanding, place, in, the, respect, and, gratitude, of, men, colorists, applied, each, color, in, assembly, line, fashion, over, fifty, were, hired, for, the, work, the, original, edition, was, engraved, in, aquatint, by, robert, havell, jr, who, took, over, the, task, after, the, first, ten, plates, engraved, by, w, h, lizars, were, deemed, inadequate, known, as, the, double, elephant, folio, for, its, double, elephant, paper, size, it, is, often, regarded, as, the, greatest, picture, book, ever, produced, and, the, finest, aquatint, work, by, the, 1830s, the, aquatint, process, had, been, largely, superseded, by, lithography, a, contemporary, french, critic, wrote, a, magic, power, transported, us, into, the, forests, which, for, so, many, years, this, man, of, genius, has, trod, learned, and, ignorant, alike, were, astonished, at, the, spectacle, it, is, a, real, and, palpable, vision, of, the, new, world, audubon, sold, oil, painted, copies, of, the, drawings, to, make, extra, money, and, publicize, the, book, a, potential, publisher, had, audubon, s, portrait, painted, by, john, syme, who, clothed, the, naturalist, in, frontier, clothes, the, portrait, was, hung, at, the, entrance, of, his, exhibitions, promoting, his, rustic, image, the, painting, is, now, held, in, the, white, house, art, collection, and, is, not, frequently, displayed, the, new, york, historical, society, holds, all, 435, of, the, preparatory, watercolors, for, the, birds, of, america, lucy, audubon, sold, them, to, the, society, after, her, husband, s, death, all, but, 80, of, the, original, copper, plates, were, melted, down, when, lucy, audubon, desperate, for, money, sold, them, for, scrap, to, the, phelps, dodge, corporation, king, george, iv, was, among, the, avid, fans, of, audubon, and, subscribed, to, support, publication, of, the, book, britain, s, royal, society, recognized, audubon, s, achievement, by, electing, him, as, a, fellow, he, was, the, second, american, to, be, elected, after, statesman, benjamin, franklin, while, in, edinburgh, to, seek, subscribers, for, the, book, audubon, gave, a, demonstration, of, his, method, of, supporting, birds, with, wire, at, professor, robert, jameson, s, wernerian, natural, history, association, student, charles, darwin, was, in, the, audience, audubon, also, visited, the, dissecting, theatre, of, the, anatomist, robert, knox, audubon, was, also, successful, in, france, gaining, the, king, and, several, of, the, nobility, as, subscribers, the, birds, of, america, became, very, popular, during, europe, s, romantic, era, audubon, s, dramatic, portraits, of, birds, appealed, to, people, in, this, period, s, fascination, with, natural, history, audubon, returned, to, america, in, 1829, to, complete, more, drawings, for, his, magnum, opus, he, also, hunted, animals, and, shipped, the, valued, skins, to, british, friends, he, was, reunited, with, his, family, after, settling, business, affairs, lucy, accompanied, him, back, to, england, audubon, found, that, during, his, absence, he, had, lost, some, subscribers, due, to, the, uneven, quality, of, coloring, of, the, plates, others, were, in, arrears, in, their, payments, his, engraver, fixed, the, plates, and, audubon, reassured, subscribers, but, a, few, begged, off, he, responded, the, birds, of, america, will, then, raise, in, value, as, much, as, they, are, now, depreciated, by, certain, fools, and, envious, persons, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, american, academy, of, arts, and, sciences, in, 1830, and, to, the, american, philosophical, society, in, 1831, he, followed, the, birds, of, america, with, a, sequel, ornithological, biographies, this, was, a, collection, of, life, histories, of, each, species, written, with, scottish, ornithologist, william, macgillivray, the, two, books, were, printed, separately, to, avoid, a, british, law, requiring, copies, of, all, publications, with, text, to, be, deposited, in, copyright, libraries, a, huge, financial, burden, for, the, self, published, audubon, both, books, were, published, between, 1827, and, 1839, during, the, 1830s, audubon, continued, making, expeditions, in, north, america, during, a, trip, to, key, west, a, companion, wrote, in, a, newspaper, article, mr, audubon, is, the, most, enthusiastic, and, indefatigable, man, i, ever, knew, mr, audubon, was, neither, dispirited, by, heat, fatigue, or, bad, luck, he, rose, every, morning, at, 3, o, clock, and, went, out, until, 1, o, clock, then, he, would, draw, the, rest, of, the, day, before, returning, to, the, field, in, the, evening, a, routine, he, kept, up, for, weeks, and, months, in, the, posthumously, published, book, the, life, of, john, james, audubon, the, naturalist, edited, by, his, widow, and, derived, primarily, from, his, notes, audubon, related, visiting, the, northeastern, florida, coastal, sugar, plantation, of, john, joachim, bulow, for, christmas, 1831, early, january, 1832, it, was, started, by, his, father, and, at, 4, 675, acres, was, the, largest, in, east, florida, bulow, had, a, sugar, mill, built, there, under, direction, of, a, scottish, engineer, who, accompanied, audubon, on, an, excursion, in, the, region, the, mill, was, destroyed, in, 1836, in, the, seminole, wars, the, plantation, site, is, preserved, today, as, the, bulow, plantation, ruins, historic, state, park, in, march, 1832, audubon, booked, passage, at, st, augustine, florida, aboard, the, schooner, agnes, bound, for, charleston, south, carolina, a, gale, forced, the, vessel, to, berth, at, the, mouth, of, the, savannah, river, where, an, officer, of, the, united, states, army, corps, of, engineers, on, cockspur, island, where, fort, pulaski, was, under, construction, transported, audubon, upstream, to, savannah, georgia, on, their, barge, just, as, he, was, about, to, board, a, charleston, bound, stage, coach, he, remembered, william, gaston, a, savannah, resident, who, had, once, befriended, him, audubon, stayed, at, city, hotel, and, the, next, day, sought, out, and, found, the, acquaintance, who, showed, but, little, enthusiasm, for, his, birds, of, america, and, who, doubted, that, the, book, would, sell, a, single, copy, in, the, city, a, dejected, audubon, continued, to, talk, to, the, merchant, and, a, mutual, friend, who, by, chance, had, appeared, the, merchant, having, further, considered, his, position, said, i, subscribe, to, your, work, gave, him, 200, for, the, first, volume, and, promised, to, act, as, his, agent, in, finding, additional, subscriptions, in, 1833, audubon, sailed, north, from, maine, accompanied, by, his, son, john, and, five, other, young, colleagues, to, explore, the, ornithology, of, labrador, on, the, return, voyage, their, ship, ripley, made, a, stop, at, st, george, s, newfoundland, there, audubon, and, his, assistants, documented, 36, species, of, birds, audubon, painted, some, of, his, works, while, staying, at, the, key, west, house, and, gardens, of, capt, john, h, geiger, this, site, was, preserved, as, the, audubon, house, and, tropical, gardens, in, 1841, having, finished, the, ornithological, biographies, audubon, returned, to, the, united, states, with, his, family, he, bought, an, estate, on, the, hudson, river, in, northern, manhattan, the, roughly, 20, acre, estate, came, to, be, known, as, audubon, park, in, the, 1860s, when, audubon, s, widow, began, selling, off, parcels, of, the, estate, for, the, development, of, free, standing, single, family, homes, between, 1840, and, 1844, he, published, an, octavo, edition, of, the, birds, of, america, with, 65, additional, plates, printed, in, standard, format, to, be, more, affordable, than, the, oversize, british, edition, it, earned, 36, 000, and, was, purchased, by, 1100, subscribers, audubon, spent, much, time, on, subscription, gathering, trips, drumming, up, sales, of, the, octavo, edition, as, he, hoped, to, leave, his, family, a, sizeable, income, audubon, made, some, excursions, out, west, where, he, hoped, to, record, western, species, he, had, missed, but, his, health, began, to, fail, in, 1848, he, manifested, signs, of, senility, or, possibly, dementia, from, what, is, now, called, alzheimer, s, disease, his, noble, mind, in, ruins, he, died, at, his, family, home, in, northern, manhattan, on, january, 27, 1851, audubon, is, buried, in, the, graveyard, at, the, church, of, the, intercession, in, the, trinity, church, cemetery, and, mausoleum, at, 155th, street, and, broadway, in, manhattan, near, his, home, an, imposing, monument, in, his, honor, was, erected, at, the, cemetery, which, is, now, recognized, as, part, of, the, heritage, rose, district, of, nyc, audubon, s, final, work, dealt, with, mammals, he, prepared, the, viviparous, quadrupeds, of, north, america, 1845, 1849, in, collaboration, with, his, good, friend, rev, john, bachman, of, charleston, south, carolina, who, supplied, much, of, the, scientific, text, his, son, john, woodhouse, audubon, drew, most, of, the, plates, the, work, was, completed, by, audubon, s, sons, and, the, second, volume, was, published, posthumously, in, 1851, audubon, developed, his, own, methods, for, drawing, birds, first, he, killed, them, using, fine, shot, he, then, used, wires, to, prop, them, into, a, natural, position, unlike, the, common, method, of, many, ornithologists, who, prepared, and, stuffed, the, specimens, into, a, rigid, pose, when, working, on, a, major, specimen, like, an, eagle, he, would, spend, up, to, four, 15, hour, days, preparing, studying, and, drawing, it, his, paintings, of, birds, are, set, true, to, life, in, their, natural, habitat, he, often, portrayed, them, as, if, caught, in, motion, especially, feeding, or, hunting, this, was, in, stark, contrast, to, the, stiff, representations, of, birds, by, his, contemporaries, such, as, alexander, wilson, audubon, based, his, paintings, on, his, extensive, field, observations, he, worked, primarily, with, watercolor, early, on, he, added, colored, chalk, or, pastel, to, add, softness, to, feathers, especially, those, of, owls, and, herons, he, employed, multiple, layers, of, watercoloring, and, sometimes, used, gouache, all, species, were, drawn, life, size, which, accounts, for, the, contorted, poses, of, the, larger, birds, as, audubon, strove, to, fit, them, within, the, page, size, smaller, species, were, usually, placed, on, branches, with, berries, fruit, and, flowers, he, used, several, birds, in, a, drawing, to, present, all, views, of, anatomy, and, wings, larger, birds, were, often, placed, in, their, ground, habitat, or, perching, on, stumps, at, times, as, with, woodpeckers, he, combined, several, species, on, one, page, to, offer, contrasting, features, he, frequently, depicted, the, birds, nests, and, eggs, and, occasionally, natural, predators, such, as, snakes, he, usually, illustrated, male, and, female, variations, and, sometimes, juveniles, in, later, drawings, audubon, used, assistants, to, render, the, habitat, for, him, in, addition, to, faithful, renderings, of, anatomy, audubon, also, employed, carefully, constructed, composition, drama, and, slightly, exaggerated, poses, to, achieve, artistic, as, well, as, scientific, effects, the, success, of, birds, of, america, has, been, marred, by, numerous, accusations, of, plagiarism, scientific, fraud, and, deliberate, manipulation, of, the, primary, record, research, has, uncovered, that, audubon, falsified, and, fabricated, scientific, data, published, fraudulent, data, and, images, in, scientific, journals, and, commercial, books, invented, new, species, to, impress, potential, subscribers, and, to, prank, rivals, and, most, likely, stole, the, holotype, specimen, of, harris, s, hawk, parabuteo, unicinctus, harrisi, before, pretending, not, to, know, its, collector, who, was, one, of, his, subscribers, he, failed, to, credit, work, by, joseph, mason, prompting, a, series, of, articles, in, 1835, by, critic, john, neal, questioning, audubon, s, honesty, and, trustworthiness, audubon, also, repeatedly, lied, about, the, details, of, his, autobiography, including, the, place, and, circumstances, of, his, birth, his, diaries, which, might, have, cleared, up, some, of, these, issues, were, destroyed, by, his, granddaughter, who, published, a, doctored, version, that, realigned, the, primary, record, with, some, of, his, false, narratives, the, litany, of, misconduct, in, audubon, s, scientific, career, has, drawn, comparisons, to, others, such, as, richard, meinertzhagen, similar, to, early, biographies, of, meinertzhagen, audubon, s, scientific, misconduct, has, been, repeatedly, ignored, and, or, played, down, by, biographers, who, defend, ornithological, biography, as, a, valuable, resource, and, a, very, good, read, audubon, s, influence, on, ornithology, and, natural, history, was, far, reaching, nearly, all, later, ornithological, works, were, inspired, by, his, artistry, and, high, standards, charles, darwin, quoted, audubon, three, times, in, on, the, origin, of, species, and, also, in, later, works, despite, some, errors, in, field, observations, he, made, a, significant, contribution, to, the, understanding, of, bird, anatomy, and, behavior, through, his, field, notes, the, birds, of, america, is, still, considered, one, of, the, greatest, examples, of, book, art, audubon, discovered, 25, new, species,
