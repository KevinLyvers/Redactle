panther, was, an, influential, poem, describing, life, from, the, perspective, of, an, animal, in, a, zoo, which, focused, more, on, its, cage, than, on, humans, one, of, the, first, to, do, so, part, of, an, early, counter, movement, against, anthropomorphic, views, of, animals, and, nature, along, with, individuals, such, as, jakob, von, uexk, ll, a, writer, of, perspectives, of, creatures, such, as, jellyfish, and, ticks, a, man, who, he, corresponded, with, and, poet, hugo, von, hofmannsthal, who, wrote, from, the, perspective, of, a, man, who, had, language, become, like, rotten, mushrooms, in, his, mouth, rilke, s, three, complete, cycles, of, poems, that, constitute, the, book, of, hours, das, stunden, buch, were, published, by, insel, verlag, in, april, 1905, these, poems, explore, the, christian, search, for, god, and, the, nature, of, prayer, using, symbolism, from, saint, francis, and, rilke, s, observation, of, orthodox, christianity, during, his, travels, to, ukraine, in, the, early, years, of, the, twentieth, century, rilke, wrote, his, only, novel, die, aufzeichnungen, des, malte, laurids, brigge, translated, as, the, notebooks, of, malte, laurids, brigge, while, living, in, paris, completing, the, work, in, 1910, the, narrative, takes, the, form, of, a, rambling, novelette, filled, with, poetic, language, and, contains, among, other, things, a, retelling, of, the, prodigal, son, tale, a, striking, description, of, death, by, illness, an, ode, to, the, joys, of, roaming, free, during, childhood, a, chilling, description, of, how, people, wear, false, faces, with, others, and, a, snarky, comment, about, the, weirdness, of, neighbors, this, semi, autobiographical, novel, adopts, the, style, and, technique, that, became, associated, with, expressionism, which, entered, european, fiction, and, art, in, the, early, 20th, century, he, was, inspired, by, sigbj, rn, obstfelder, s, work, a, priest, s, diary, and, jens, peter, jacobsen, s, novel, niels, lyhne, 1880, which, traces, the, fate, of, an, atheist, in, a, merciless, world, rilke, addresses, existential, themes, profoundly, probing, the, quest, for, individuality, and, the, significance, of, death, and, reflecting, on, the, experience, of, time, as, death, approaches, he, draws, considerably, on, the, writings, of, nietzsche, whose, work, he, came, to, know, through, lou, andreas, salom, his, work, also, incorporates, impressionistic, techniques, that, were, influenced, by, c, zanne, and, rodin, to, whom, rilke, was, secretary, in, 1905, 1906, he, combines, these, techniques, and, motifs, to, conjure, images, of, mankind, s, anxiety, and, alienation, in, the, face, of, an, increasingly, scientific, industrial, and, reified, world, rilke, began, writing, the, elegies, in, 1912, while, a, guest, of, princess, marie, von, thurn, und, taxis, 1855, 1934, at, duino, castle, near, trieste, on, the, adriatic, sea, during, this, ten, year, period, the, elegies, languished, incomplete, for, long, stretches, of, time, as, rilke, suffered, frequently, from, severe, depression, some, of, which, was, caused, by, the, events, of, world, war, i, and, his, conscripted, military, service, aside, from, brief, episodes, of, writing, in, 1913, and, 1915, rilke, did, not, return, to, the, work, until, a, few, years, after, the, war, ended, with, a, sudden, renewed, inspiration, writing, in, a, frantic, pace, he, described, as, a, savage, creative, storm, he, completed, the, collection, in, february, 1922, while, staying, at, ch, teau, de, muzot, in, veyras, in, switzerland, s, rh, ne, valley, after, their, publication, and, his, death, shortly, thereafter, the, duino, elegies, were, quickly, recognized, by, critics, and, scholars, as, rilke, s, most, important, work, the, duino, elegies, are, intensely, religious, mystical, poems, that, weigh, beauty, and, existential, suffering, the, poems, employ, a, rich, symbolism, of, angels, and, salvation, but, not, in, keeping, with, typical, christian, interpretations, rilke, begins, the, first, elegy, in, an, invocation, of, philosophical, despair, asking, who, if, i, cried, out, would, hear, me, among, the, hierarchies, of, angels, wer, wenn, ich, schriee, h, rte, mich, denn, aus, der, engel, ordnungen, and, later, declares, that, every, angel, is, terrifying, jeder, engel, ist, schrecklich, while, labelling, of, these, poems, as, elegies, would, typically, imply, melancholy, and, lamentation, many, passages, are, marked, by, their, positive, energy, and, unrestrained, enthusiasm, together, the, duino, elegies, are, described, as, a, metamorphosis, of, rilke, s, ontological, torment, and, an, impassioned, monologue, about, coming, to, terms, with, human, existence, discussing, themes, of, the, limitations, and, insufficiency, of, the, human, condition, and, fractured, human, consciousness, man, s, loneliness, the, perfection, of, the, angels, life, and, death, love, and, lovers, and, the, task, of, the, poet, with, news, of, the, death, of, wera, knoop, 1900, 1919, his, daughter, s, friend, rilke, was, inspired, to, create, and, set, to, work, on, sonnets, to, orpheus, in, 1922, between, february, 2, and, 5, he, completed, the, first, section, of, 26, sonnets, for, the, next, few, days, he, focused, on, the, duino, elegies, completing, them, on, the, evening, of, february, 11, immediately, thereafter, he, returned, to, work, on, the, sonnets, and, completed, the, following, section, of, 29, sonnets, in, less, than, two, weeks, throughout, the, sonnets, wera, is, frequently, referenced, both, directly, by, name, and, indirectly, in, allusions, to, a, dancer, and, the, mythical, eurydice, although, rilke, claimed, that, the, entire, cycle, was, inspired, by, wera, she, appears, as, a, character, in, only, one, of, the, poems, he, insisted, however, that, wera, s, own, figure, nevertheless, governs, and, moves, the, course, of, the, whole, the, sonnets, contents, are, as, is, typical, of, rilke, highly, metaphorical, the, character, of, orpheus, whom, rilke, refers, to, as, the, god, with, the, lyre, appears, several, times, in, the, cycle, as, do, other, mythical, characters, such, as, daphne, there, are, also, biblical, allusions, including, a, reference, to, esau, other, themes, involve, animals, peoples, of, different, cultures, and, time, and, death, in, 1929, writer, franz, xaver, kappus, 1883, 1966, published, a, collection, of, ten, letters, that, then, between, 27, 32, year, old, rilke, had, written, to, him, over, the, course, of, 6, years, beginning, when, kappus, was, a, 19, year, old, officer, cadet, studying, at, the, theresian, military, academy, in, wiener, neustadt, where, he, had, a, professor,

officer, s, education, after, a, year, in, military, highschool, between, 1902, and, 1908, the, young, kappus, had, written, rilke, when, he, was, uncertain, about, his, future, as, a, military, officer, or, as, a, poet, initially, he, sought, rilke, s, advice, as, to, the, quality, of, his, poetry, and, whether, he, ought, to, pursue, writing, as, a, career, while, he, declined, to, comment, much, on, kappus, s, writings, rilke, advised, kappus, on, how, a, poet, should, feel, love, and, seek, truth, in, trying, to, understand, and, experience, the, world, around, him, and, engage, the, world, of, art, these, letters, offer, insight, into, the, ideas, and, themes, that, appear, in, rilke, s, poetry, and, his, working, process, and, were, written, during, a, key, period, of, rilke, s, early, artistic, development, after, his, reputation, as, a, poet, began, to, be, established, with, the, publication, of, parts, of, das, stunden, buch, the, book, of, hours, and, das, buch, der, bilder, the, book, of, images, rilke, extensively, engaged, with, metaphors, metonymy, and, contradictions, in, his, poetry, and, prose, to, convey, disbelief, and, a, crisis, of, faith, figures, from, greek, mythology, such, as, apollo, hermes, and, orpheus, recur, as, motifs, in, his, poems, and, are, depicted, in, original, interpretations, that, often, double, as, analogies, for, his, experiences, rilke, s, poems, also, feature, figures, of, angels, famously, described, in, the, duino, elegies, as, terrifying, schrecklich, he, also, occasionally, explored, the, crisis, of, his, catholic, faith, including, in, his, little, known, 1898, poem, visions, of, christ, where, he, depicted, mary, magdalene, as, the, mother, of, jesus, child, rilke, is, one, of, the, best, selling, poets, in, the, united, states, in, popular, culture, rilke, is, frequently, quoted, or, referenced, in, television, shows, motion, pictures, music, and, other, works, when, these, works, discuss, the, subject, of, love, or, angels, his, work, is, often, described, as, mystical, and, has, been, quoted, and, referenced, by, self, help, authors, rilke, has, been, reinterpreted, as, a, master, who, can, lead, us, to, a, more, fulfilled, and, less, anxious, life, rilke, s, work, has, influenced, several, poets, and, writers, including, william, h, gass, galway, kinnell, sidney, keyes,
