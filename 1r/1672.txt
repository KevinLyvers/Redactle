robert, boyle, frs, b, l, 25, january, 1627, 31, december, 1691, was, an, anglo, irish, natural, philosopher, chemist, physicist, alchemist, and, inventor, boyle, is, largely, regarded, today, as, the, first, modern, chemist, and, therefore, one, of, the, founders, of, modern, chemistry, and, one, of, the, pioneers, of, modern, experimental, scientific, method, he, is, best, known, for, boyle, s, law, which, describes, the, inversely, proportional, relationship, between, the, absolute, pressure, and, volume, of, a, gas, if, the, temperature, is, kept, constant, within, a, closed, system, among, his, works, the, sceptical, chymist, is, seen, as, a, cornerstone, book, in, the, field, of, chemistry, he, was, a, devout, and, pious, anglican, and, is, noted, for, his, writings, in, theology, boyle, was, born, at, lismore, castle, in, county, waterford, ireland, the, seventh, son, and, fourteenth, child, of, the, 1st, earl, of, cork, the, great, earl, of, cork, and, catherine, fenton, lord, cork, then, known, simply, as, richard, boyle, had, arrived, in, dublin, from, england, in, 1588, during, the, tudor, plantations, of, ireland, and, obtained, an, appointment, as, a, deputy, escheator, he, had, amassed, enormous, wealth, and, landholdings, by, the, time, robert, was, born, and, had, been, created, earl, of, cork, in, october, 1620, catherine, fenton, countess, of, cork, was, the, daughter, of, sir, geoffrey, fenton, the, former, secretary, of, state, for, ireland, who, was, born, in, dublin, in, 1539, and, alice, weston, the, daughter, of, robert, weston, who, was, born, in, lismore, in, 1541, as, a, child, boyle, was, raised, by, a, wet, nurse, as, were, his, elder, brothers, boyle, received, private, tutoring, in, latin, greek, and, french, and, when, he, was, eight, years, old, following, the, death, of, his, mother, he, and, his, brother, francis, were, sent, to, eton, college, in, england, his, father, s, friend, sir, henry, wotton, was, then, the, provost, of, the, college, during, this, time, his, father, hired, a, private, tutor, robert, carew, who, had, knowledge, of, irish, to, act, as, private, tutor, to, his, sons, in, eton, however, only, mr, robert, sometimes, desires, it, and, is, a, little, entered, in, it, but, despite, the, many, reasons, given, by, carew, to, turn, their, attentions, to, it, they, practice, the, french, and, latin, but, they, affect, not, the, irish, after, spending, over, three, years, at, eton, robert, travelled, abroad, with, a, french, tutor, they, visited, italy, in, 1641, and, remained, in, florence, during, the, winter, of, that, year, studying, the, paradoxes, of, the, great, star, gazer, the, elderly, galileo, galilei, robert, returned, to, england, from, continental, europe, in, mid, 1644, with, a, keen, interest, in, scientific, research, his, father, lord, cork, had, died, the, previous, year, and, had, left, him, the, manor, of, stalbridge, in, dorset, as, well, as, substantial, estates, in, county, limerick, in, ireland, that, he, had, acquired, robert, then, made, his, residence, at, stalbridge, house, between, 1644, and, 1652, and, settled, a, laboratory, where, he, conducted, many, experiments, from, that, time, robert, devoted, his, life, to, scientific, research, and, soon, took, a, prominent, place, in, the, band, of, enquirers, known, as, the, invisible, college, who, devoted, themselves, to, the, cultivation, of, the, new, philosophy, they, met, frequently, in, london, often, at, gresham, college, and, some, of, the, members, also, had, meetings, at, oxford, having, made, several, visits, to, his, irish, estates, beginning, in, 1647, robert, moved, to, ireland, in, 1652, but, became, frustrated, at, his, inability, to, make, progress, in, his, chemical, work, in, one, letter, he, described, ireland, as, a, barbarous, country, where, chemical, spirits, were, so, misunderstood, and, chemical, instruments, so, unprocurable, that, it, was, hard, to, have, any, hermetic, thoughts, in, it, all, souls, oxford, university, shows, the, arms, of, boyle, s, family, in, colonnade, of, the, great, quadrangle, opposite, the, arms, of, the, hill, family, of, shropshire, close, by, a, sundial, designed, by, boyle, s, friend, christopher, wren, in, 1654, boyle, left, ireland, for, oxford, to, pursue, his, work, more, successfully, an, inscription, can, be, found, on, the, wall, of, university, college, oxford, the, high, street, at, oxford, now, the, location, of, the, shelley, memorial, marking, the, spot, where, cross, hall, stood, until, the, early, 19th, century, it, was, here, that, boyle, rented, rooms, from, the, wealthy, apothecary, who, owned, the, hall, reading, in, 1657, of, otto, von, guericke, s, air, pump, he, set, himself, with, the, assistance, of, robert, hooke, to, devise, improvements, in, its, construction, guericke, s, air, pump, was, large, and, required, the, continual, labour, of, two, strong, men, for, divers, hours, and, boyle, constructed, one, that, could, be, operated, conveniently, on, a, desktop, with, the, result, the, machina, boyleana, or, pneumatical, engine, finished, in, 1659, he, began, a, series, of, experiments, on, the, properties, of, air, and, coined, the, term, factitious, airs, an, account, of, boyle, s, work, with, the, air, pump, was, published, in, 1660, under, the, title, new, experiments, physico, mechanical, touching, the, spring, of, the, air, and, its, effects, among, the, critics, of, the, views, put, forward, in, this, book, was, a, jesuit, francis, line, 1595, 1675, and, it, was, while, answering, his, objections, that, boyle, made, his, first, mention, of, the, law, that, the, volume, of, a, gas, varies, inversely, to, the, pressure, of, the, gas, which, among, english, speaking, people, is, usually, called, boyle, s, law, after, his, name, the, person, who, originally, formulated, the, hypothesis, was, henry, power, in, 1661, boyle, in, 1662, included, a, reference, to, a, paper, written, by, power, but, mistakenly, attributed, it, to, richard, towneley, in, continental, europe, the, hypothesis, is, sometimes, attributed, to, edme, mariotte, although, he, did, not, publish, it, until, 1676, and, was, probably, aware, of, boyle, s, work, at, the, time, in, 1663, the, invisible, college, became, the, royal, society, of, london, for, improving, natural, knowledge, and, the, charter, of, incorporation, granted, by, charles, ii, of, england, named, boyle, a, member, of, the, council, in, 1680, he, was, elected, president, of, the, society, but, declined, the, honour, from, a, scruple, about, oaths, he, made, a, wish, list, of, 24, possible, inventions, which, included, the, prolongation, of, life, the, art, of, flying, perpetual, light, making, armour, light, and, extremely, hard, a, ship, to, sail, with, all, winds, and, a, ship, not, to, be, sunk, practicable, and, certain, way, of, finding, longitudes, potent, drugs, to, alter, or, exalt, imagination, waking, memory, and, other, functions, and, appease, pain, procure, innocent, sleep, harmless, dreams, etc, all, but, a, few, of, the, 24, have, come, true, in, 1668, he, left, oxford, for, london, where, he, resided, at, the, house, of, his, elder, sister, katherine, jones, lady, ranelagh, in, pall, mall, he, experimented, in, the, laboratory, she, had, in, her, home, and, attended, her, salon, of, intellectuals, interested, in, the, sciences, the, siblings, maintained, a, lifelong, intellectual, partnership, where, brother, and, sister, shared, medical, remedies, promoted, each, other, s, scientific, ideas, and, edited, each, other, s, manuscripts, his, contemporaries, widely, acknowledged, katherine, s, influence, on, his, work, but, later, historiographers, dropped, discussion, of, her, accomplishments, and, relationship, to, her, brother, from, their, histories, in, 1669, his, health, never, very, strong, began, to, fail, seriously, and, he, gradually, withdrew, from, his, public, engagements, ceasing, his, communications, to, the, royal, society, and, advertising, his, desire, to, be, excused, from, receiving, guests, unless, upon, occasions, very, extraordinary, on, tuesday, and, friday, forenoon, and, wednesday, and, saturday, afternoon, in, the, leisure, thus, gained, he, wished, to, recruit, his, spirits, range, his, papers, and, prepare, some, important, chemical, investigations, which, he, proposed, to, leave, as, a, kind, of, hermetic, legacy, to, the, studious, disciples, of, that, art, but, of, which, he, did, not, make, known, the, nature, his, health, became, still, worse, in, 1691, and, he, died, on, 31, december, that, year, just, a, week, after, the, death, of, his, sister, katherine, in, whose, home, he, had, lived, and, with, whom, he, had, shared, scientific, pursuits, for, more, than, twenty, years, boyle, died, from, paralysis, he, was, buried, in, the, churchyard, of, st, martin, in, the, fields, his, funeral, sermon, being, preached, by, his, friend, bishop, gilbert, burnet, in, his, will, boyle, endowed, a, series, of, lectures, that, came, to, be, known, as, the, boyle, lectures, boyle, s, great, merit, as, a, scientific, investigator, is, that, he, carried, out, the, principles, which, francis, bacon, espoused, in, the, novum, organum, yet, he, would, not, avow, himself, a, follower, of, bacon, or, indeed, of, any, other, teacher, on, several, occasions, he, mentions, that, to, keep, his, judgment, as, unprepossessed, as, might, be, with, any, of, the, modern, theories, of, philosophy, until, he, was, provided, of, experiments, to, help, him, judge, of, them, he, refrained, from, any, study, of, the, atomical, and, the, cartesian, systems, and, even, of, the, novum, organum, itself, though, he, admits, to, transiently, consulting, them, about, a, few, particulars, nothing, was, more, alien, to, his, mental, temperament, than, the, spinning, of, hypotheses, he, regarded, the, acquisition, of, knowledge, as, an, end, in, itself, and, in, consequence, he, gained, a, wider, outlook, on, the, aims, of, scientific, inquiry, than, had, been, enjoyed, by, his, predecessors, for, many, centuries, this, however, did, not, mean, that, he, paid, no, attention, to, the, practical, application, of, science, nor, that, he, despised, knowledge, which, tended, to, use, robert, boyle, was, an, alchemist, and, believing, the, transmutation, of, metals, to, be, a, possibility, he, carried, out, experiments, in, the, hope, of, achieving, it, and, he, was, instrumental, in, obtaining, the, repeal, by, the, royal, mines, act, 1688, 1, will, mar, c, 30, of, the, statute, of, henry, iv, against, multiplying, gold, and, silver, the, gold, and, silver, act, 1403, 5, hen, 4, c, 4, with, all, the, important, work, he, accomplished, in, physics, the, enunciation, of, boyle, s, law, the, discovery, of, the, part, taken, by, air, in, the, propagation, of, sound, and, investigations, on, the, expansive, force, of, freezing, water, on, specific, gravities, and, refractive, powers, on, crystals, on, electricity, on, colour, on, hydrostatics, etc, chemistry, was, his, peculiar, and, favourite, study, his, first, book, on, the, subject, was, the, sceptical, chymist, published, in, 1661, in, which, he, criticised, the, experiments, whereby, vulgar, spagyrists, are, wont, to, endeavour, to, evince, their, salt, sulphur, and, mercury, to, be, the, true, principles, of, things, for, him, chemistry, was, the, science, of, the, composition, of, substances, not, merely, an, adjunct, to, the, arts, of, the, alchemist, or, the, physician, he, endorsed, the, view, of, elements, as, the, undecomposable, constituents, of, material, bodies, and, made, the, distinction, between, mixtures, and, compounds, he, made, considerable, progress, in, the, technique, of, detecting, their, ingredients, a, process, which, he, designated, by, the, term, analysis, he, further, supposed, that, the, elements, were, ultimately, composed, of, particles, of, various, sorts, and, sizes, into, which, however, they, were, not, to, be, resolved, in, any, known, way, he, studied, the, chemistry, of, combustion, and, of, respiration, and, conducted, experiments, in, physiology, where, however, he, was, hampered, by, the, tenderness, of, his, nature, which, kept, him, from, anatomical, dissections, especially, vivisections, though, he, knew, them, to, be, most, instructing, in, addition, to, philosophy, boyle, devoted, much, time, to, theology, showing, a, very, decided, leaning, to, the, practical, side, and, an, indifference, to, controversial, polemics, at, the, restoration, of, the, king, in, 1660, he, was, favourably, received, at, court, and, in, 1665, would, have, received, the, provostship, of, eton, college, had, he, agreed, to, take, holy, orders, but, this, he, refused, to, do, on, the, ground, that, his, writings, on, religious, subjects, would, have, greater, weight, coming, from, a, layman, than, a, paid, minister, of, the, church, moreover, boyle, incorporated, his, scientific, interests, into, his, theology, believing, that, natural, philosophy, could, provide, powerful, evidence, for, the, existence, of, god, in, works, such, as, disquisition, about, the, final, causes, of, natural, things, 1688, for, instance, he, criticised, contemporary, philosophers, such, as, ren, descartes, who, denied, that, the, study, of, nature, could, reveal, much, about, god, instead, boyle, argued, that, natural, philosophers, could, use, the, design, apparently, on, display, in, some, parts, of, nature, to, demonstrate, god, s, involvement, with, the, world, he, also, attempted, to, tackle, complex, theological, questions, using, methods, derived, from, his, scientific, practices, in, some, physico, theological, considerations, about, the, possibility, of, the, resurrection, 1675, he, used, a, chemical, experiment, known, as, the, reduction, to, the, pristine, state, as, part, of, an, attempt, to, demonstrate, the, physical, possibility, of, the, resurrection, of, the, body, throughout, his, career, boyle, tried, to, show, that, science, could, lend, support, to, christianity, as, a, director, of, the, east, india, company, he, spent, large, sums, in, promoting, the, spread, of, christianity, in, the, east, contributing, liberally, to, missionary, societies, and, to, the, expenses, of, translating, the, bible, or, portions, of, it, into, various, languages, boyle, supported, the, policy, that, the, bible, should, be, available, in, the, vernacular, language, of, the, people, an, irish, language, version, of, the, new, testament, was, published, in, 1602, but, was, rare, in, boyle, s, adult, life, in, 1680, 85, boyle, personally, financed, the, printing, of, the, bible, both, old, and, new, testaments, in, irish, in, this, respect, boyle, s, attitude, to, the, irish, language, differed, from, the, protestant, ascendancy, class, in, ireland, at, the, time, which, was, generally, hostile, to, the, language, and, largely, opposed, the, use, of, irish, not, only, as, a, language, of, religious, worship, boyle, also, had, a, monogenist, perspective, about, race, origin, he, was, a, pioneer, in, studying, races, and, he, believed, that, all, human, beings, no, matter, how, diverse, their, physical, differences, came, from, the, same, source, adam, and, eve, he, studied, reported, stories, of, parents, giving, birth, to, different, coloured, albinos, so, he, concluded, that, adam, and, eve, were, originally, white, and, that, caucasians, could, give, birth, to, different, coloured, races, boyle, also, extended, the, theories, of, robert, hooke, and, isaac, newton, about, colour, and, light, via, optical, projection, in, physics, into, discourses, of, polygenesis, speculating, that, maybe, these, differences, were, due, to, seminal, impressions, taking, this, into, account, it, might, be, considered, that, he, envisioned, a, good, explanation, for, complexion, at, his, time, due, to, the, fact, that, now, we, know, that, skin, colour, is, disposed, by, genes, which, are, actually, contained, in, the, semen, boyle, s, writings, mention, that, at, his, time, for, european, eyes, beauty, was, not, measured, so, much, in, colour, of, skin, but, in, stature, comely, symmetry, of, the, parts, of, the, body, and, good, features, in, the, face, various, members, of, the, scientific, community, rejected, his, views, and, described, them, as, disturbing, or, amusing, in, his, will, boyle, provided, money, for, a, series, of, lectures, to, defend, the, christian, religion, against, those, he, considered, notorious, infidels, namely, atheists, deists, pagans, jews, and, muslims, with, the, provision, that, controversies, between, christians, were, not, to, be, mentioned, see, boyle, lectures, as, a, founder, of, the, royal, society, he, was, elected, a, fellow, of, the, royal, society, frs, in, 1663, boyle, s, law, is, named, in, his, honour, the, royal, society, of, chemistry, issues, a, robert, boyle, prize, for, analytical, science, named, in, his, honour, the, boyle, medal, for, scientific, excellence, in, ireland, inaugurated, in, 1899, is, awarded, jointly, by, the, royal, dublin, society, and, the, irish, times, launched, in, 2012, the, robert, boyle, summer, school, organized, by, the, waterford, institute, of, technology, with, support, from, lismore, castle, is, held, annually, to, honor, the, heritage, of, robert, boyle, the, following, are, some, of, the, more, important, of, his, works, among, his, religious, and, philosophical, writings, were
